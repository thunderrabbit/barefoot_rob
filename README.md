This repo has event, blog, and other entries in separate sections.

    content/event
           /blog

Using [mainsections](https://gohugo.io/functions/where/#mainsections) `event` entries to show up on the top page.

I would like the prev/next at the bottom of single event pages to only point to other events

Similarly for prev/next at the bottom of single blog entries to only point to other blog entries..
