New Moon offers the best energies for Wish making... 🌑

Come and experience a simple and fun "New Moon Ritual" ✨🌑 with [Maxence](https://livespiritual4.wordpress.com/about-maxence/) and [Barefoot Rob](https://www.robnugen.com/en/about/)

On that day, you can charge and focus energy to achieve specific goals... ✨

Throughout our time,
we'll touch the earth,
connect with nature,
connect with friends..
all while enjoying the night air.

Enjoy chatting and barefoot walking on the new moon night.  Share beautiful experiences with like-minded friends!
