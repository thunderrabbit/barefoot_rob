Enjoy the night air.  Enjoy moonlight.  Touch the earth. Connect with nature. Connect with friends.

Enjoy meditation and barefoot walking on the full moon night.  Share beautiful experiences with like-minded friends!

The energy of the full moon supports us in releasing unwanted energies,
so we'll also share some time in
meditative energetic release under the full moon.

We'll relax in a lovely grass baseball field next to Tama River.

Get away from it all by settling into your being and noticing the
motions of your body, one breath and one step at a time.
