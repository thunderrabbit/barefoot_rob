# What is a Cuddle Party?
　
A Cuddle Party is a non-sexual social event where participants practice communication and optionally explore platonic touch. Attendees practice setting clear boundaries, communicating their desires, and respecting each others' limits in a safe space.
　
Cuddle Parties provide an opportunity for nurturing, platonic touch and intimacy, which supports well-being and balanced emotions.
　
While sexual activity is prohibited at Cuddle Parties, some light touching like hugs, caresses, and snuggling is allowed between consenting attendees.
　
At a Cuddle Party, physical contact is optional. The primary goals of a Cuddle Party are to practice exploring consent and communication with others.
　
# What do we do at a Cuddle Party?
　
We do two main things at Cuddle Parties:
　
1. Practice consent.
  A key part of Cuddle Parties is learning how to communicate your desires and how to respect others' requests.
2. Consensual platonic touch.
  Optionally experience and appreciate caring touch from other like-minded people.
　
We’ll start with an Welcome Circle to get us settled. We’ll then go through the rules of Cuddle Party in a mini communication workshop, allowing participants to practice inner awareness and clear expression of boundaries.
　
After the communication workshop, we'll have 2 or more hours of Self-Directed Connection
　
    This is a time for you to ask for what you want, say yes and no to requests and invitations, cuddle according to your desires and comfort (or just talk if you prefer), connect with fascinating people, "cuddle mingle," and, ultimately, relax into the flow of an unusually playful and respectful social environment.
　
    Some participants cuddle in groups, others one-on-one, while some like to talk and not cuddle for a time, or not at all. Cuddling can mean feet against feet, full-body hugs, head-rubs, spooning — it is, indeed, up to you. And, configurations and positions shift significantly throughout the event, thanks in part to Rule 6: You are encouraged to change your mind.

We'll finish with a closing circle to reflect on our experience.
　
# Why?
　
Clear communication allows more harmonious relationships, regardless of the context.
　
Nurturing and consensual touch supports a healthy life, strong nervous system, and balanced emotions.
　
# Testimonials
　
It was a great event. Thank you so much.    Hope more and more people will join the event.   For us Japanese, we don't communicate that much by hugging, but I think people need it. Hugging helps people a lot to be feeling safe.   It was a great workshop.

Rob, you are fantastic.  There really should be more events like this, which have great potential to heal this broken world.   Our society would be so much better if we learned this type of communication at school instead of things like algebra and geometry that most of us never use and forget as soon as the course is over.
ー Andy Boerger　
　
So happy that you are offering these events.   I think it's super valuable for the society at large,   especially as more people become aware of them  and start participating. Thank you!

# When
　
HUMANDATE
　
Doors will open at FIRST_GATHERING_TIME.
　
Please arrive between FIRST_GATHERING_TIME and ARRIVE_BY_TIME so we can be settled and start our Welcome Circle at EVENT_TIME.
　
To maintain the integrity of the container, no one will be admitted after we start the Welcome Circle. Allowing late arrivals could disrupt the flow of introductions and discussions about boundaries and consent that help establish the supportive environment of the cuddle party.
　
The Welcome Circle will last around an hour, then you are welcome to stay for Self-Directed Connection, socializing, and snacks. The space will be available until 15_B4_RENTAL_ENDS.
