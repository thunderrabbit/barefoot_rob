Summary:

Join the Cuddle Party revolution! A communication workshop promoting consent, boundaries, & the health of platonic touch. #CuddleParty


Description (copy one section of text then insert image, repeat)

# What is a Cuddle Party?

A Cuddle Party is a non-sexual social event where participants practice communication and optionally explore platonic touch. Attendees practice setting clear boundaries, communicating their desires, and respecting each others' limits in a safe space.

Cuddle Parties provide an opportunity for nurturing, platonic touch and intimacy, which supports well-being and balanced emotions.

While sexual activity is prohibited at Cuddle Parties, some light touching like hugs, caresses, and snuggling is allowed between consenting attendees of all genders.  LGBTIQ+ friendly!

At a Cuddle Party, physical contact is optional. The primary goals of a Cuddle Party are to practice exploring consent and communication with others.

# What do we do at a Cuddle Party?

We do two main things at Cuddle Parties:

1. Practice consent.
  A key part of Cuddle Parties is learning how to communicate your desires and how to respect others' requests.
2. Consensual platonic touch.
  Optionally experience and appreciate caring touch from other like-minded people.

We’ll start with an Welcome Circle to get us settled. We’ll then go through the rules of Cuddle Party in a mini communication workshop, allowing participants to practice inner awareness and clear expression of boundaries.

After the communication workshop, we'll have 2 hours of Self-Directed Connection

    This is time for you to ask for what you want, say yes and no to requests and invitations, cuddle according to your desires and comfort (or just talk if you prefer), connect with fascinating people, "cuddle mingle," and, ultimately, relax into the flow of an unusually playful and respectful social environment.

    Some participants cuddle in groups, others one-on-one, while some like to talk and not cuddle for a time, or not at all. Cuddling can mean feet against feet, full-body hugs, head-rubs, spooning — it is, indeed, up to you. And, configurations and positions shift significantly throughout the event, thanks in part to Rule 6: You are encouraged to change your mind.

We'll finish with a closing circle to reflect on our experience.

# Testimonials

It was a great event. Thank you so much.    Hope more and more people will join the event.   For us Japanese, we don't communicate that much by hugging, but I think people need it. Hugging helps people a lot to be feeling safe.   It was a great workshop.
    ー Lily

I attended the cuddle party in February. It had a profound impact on my nervous system. The exercises we did while learning were heaps of fun. I felt like I was a kid again. It was a real joy to be learning through play, about communication with myself and others about touch. I would highly recommend it to all people. I hope one day to live in a society where non sexual touch is a welcomed, consensual form of communication.
    ー Brett Waller

Rob definitely created a safe space for strangers coming together at a Cuddle Party to connect with one another in a warm, confident, fun, playful and loving way. He was able to demonstrate very quickly how to use curiousity to explore play and touch in an intimate yet platonic setting.

I had such a fun time, it was beyond my expectation of what a Cuddle Party is in my mind. I felt I received a lot of healing from receiving and giving affection and touch. It was fun to connect with the other participants as well.

I highly recommend this experience to anyone who is looking for connection, willing to allow their inner child to play and express and receive love through the power of touch. I definitely will be coming back again!

# Your Facilitator, Rob Nugen

I help ambitious men to discover their gold on a journey into the divine masculine. I guide men who feel overwhelmed by their past and "traditional" masculinity to break away from their inner demons of self-defeat and shame through transformative shadow work, space holding and circle work.

I am a TedX speaker, barefoot walker for over 20 years, trained and run men circles with ManKind Project since 2015. I made a powerful decision to release myself from a 12 year marriage that had become untenable. Now I'm with my dream woman who matches my values and offers the love I desire.
