Summary:

Join the Cuddle Party revolution! A communication workshop promoting consent, boundaries, & the health of platonic touch. #CuddleParty

Description

# What is a Cuddle Party?

A Cuddle Party is a non-sexual social event where participants practice communication and optionally explore platonic touch. Attendees practice setting clear boundaries, communicating their desires, and respecting each others' limits in a safe space.

Cuddle Parties provide an opportunity for nurturing, platonic touch and intimacy, which supports well-being and balanced emotions.

While sexual activity is prohibited at Cuddle Parties, some light touching like hugs, caresses, and snuggling is allowed between consenting attendees.

At a Cuddle Party, physical contact is optional. The primary goals of a Cuddle Party are to practice exploring consent and communication with others.

# What do we do at a Cuddle Party?

We do two main things at Cuddle Parties:

1. Practice consent.
  A key part of Cuddle Parties is learning how to communicate your desires and how to respect others' requests.
2. Consensual platonic touch.
  Optionally experience and appreciate caring touch from other like-minded people.

We’ll start with an Welcome Circle to get us settled. We’ll then go through the rules of Cuddle Party in a mini communication workshop, allowing participants to practice inner awareness and clear expression of boundaries.

After the communication workshop, we'll have 2 or more hours of Self-Directed Connection

    This is time for you to ask for what you want, say yes and no to requests and invitations, cuddle according to your desires and comfort (or just talk if you prefer), connect with fascinating people, "cuddle mingle," and, ultimately, relax into the flow of an unusually playful and respectful social environment.

    Some participants cuddle in groups, others one-on-one, while some like to talk and not cuddle for a time, or not at all. Cuddling can mean feet against feet, full-body hugs, head-rubs, spooning — it is, indeed, up to you. And, configurations and positions shift significantly throughout the event, thanks in part to Rule 6: You are encouraged to change your mind.

We'll finish with a closing circle to reflect on our experience.

# Why?

Clear communication allows more harmonious relationships, regardless of the context.

Nurturing and consensual touch supports a healthy life, strong nervous system, and balanced emotions.

# Testimonials

It was a great event. Thank you so much.    Hope more and more people will join the event.   For us Japanese, we don't communicate that much by hugging, but I think people need it. Hugging helps people a lot to be feeling safe.   It was a great workshop.

Rob, you are fantastic.  There really should be more events like this, which have great potential to heal this broken world.   Our society would be so much better if we learned this type of communication at school instead of things like algebra and geometry that most of us never use and forget as soon as the course is over.
    ー Andy Boerger

 So happy that you are offering these events.   I think it's super valuable for the society at large,   especially as more people become aware of them  and start participating. Thank you!

# About me, “Barefoot” Rob Nugen

I have a passion for connecting with the world around me, especially walking barefoot. This helps me to stay grounded, and appreciate the beauty of the present moment. I’m leading Cuddle Party events to help welcome us back into connection after an isolating pandemic.

I have been running a men’s peer counseling group in Tokyo since 2015, and conducting in-person workshops in both Tokyo and Kanagawa since 2018.

    Rob is amazing. He is a perfect facilitator in every way.
    He is caring, kind, self-effacing, honest. Ten out of ten.
