SUMMARY:Emotional Awareness Workshop at The Pink Cow
DESCRIPTION:Join us for yummy food and deep connection at The Pink Cow! I'll be leading a one-hour workshop inspired by my book *I'M FINE*.\n\nWe'll begin with placing our orders from their delicious California-Mexican menu\, before connecting with a simple check-in circle\, and enjoy a few gentle\, engaging activities focused on emotional awareness.\n\nI'll also read a short section from my book… featuring my rarely-heard Texan accent 🤠\n\nThis is an easy\, welcoming introduction to the kind of work I do with men and mixed groups: noticing what's happening behind "I'm fine"\n\nThere's no workshop fee. Please just buy food and/or drinks at The Pink Cow to thank Traci and Naoya for their venue.\n\nAll are welcome. Come as you are.
