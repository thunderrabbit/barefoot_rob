They say our eyes are the window to the soul. This workshop will give us a chance to look more deeply into ourselves and more deeply into those around us.
The process is simple, and the results can be profound. You may discover parts about yourself that you didn't know where there.

In this workshop, we will be looking into the eyes of people that we may never have met before. We will have a chance to sit with multiple participants, with a small break in between each person.

It's important to have an intention before each eye gazing practice, so be sure to have some possible intentions in mind. Some examples might be

* “I intend to get to know myself better”
* “I intend to connect with my intuition”
* “I intend to practice acceptance of others”
* “I intend to practice acceptance of myself”

Let’s enjoy learning about ourselves and each other.

Location: between Shibuya and Shinsen stations on Dogenzaka

One woman said "now I know who I am."

    2人1組になり、ペアを組んだ相手の目を見続け、その観察の結果を参加者
    同士でシェアするユニークなワークショップは、多くの気づきと学びがあ

    な機会となった。

    A unique workshop in which two people form a pair, keep an eye on
    the paired opponents, and share the results of the observation
    among the participants, have a lot of awareness and learning, and
    improve the status of their day. It was a valuable opportunity to
    know and maintain my mind.   (translation by Google)
