They say our eyes are the window to the soul. This workshop will give us a chance to look more deeply into ourselves and more deeply into those around us.

The process is simple, and the results can be profound. You may discover parts about yourself that you didn't know where there.

In this workshop, we will be looking into the eyes of people that we may never have met before. We will have a chance to sit with multiple participants, with a small break in between each person.

Letâ€™s enjoy learning about ourselves and each other.

Location: between Shibuya and Shinsen stations on Dogenzaka

RSVP here or PM me and I will send you address information
