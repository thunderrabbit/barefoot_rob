They say our eyes are the window to the soul. This will be our 3rd eye gazing workshop, which will give us a chance to look more deeply into ourselves and more deeply into those around us.

The process is simple, and the results can be profound. You may discover parts of yourself that you didn't know were there.

In this workshop, we will be looking into the eyes of people that we may never have met before. We will have a chance to sit with multiple participants, with a small break in between each person.

Let’s enjoy learning about ourselves and each other.

Schedule:

* 1:45pm - 2pm: gathering time
* 2:00pm - 2:45pm begin eye gazing, doing some short segments then changing partners
* 2:45pm have a break and discussion
* 3:00pm - 3:45pm longer segments of eye gazing
* 3:50pm final thoughts, closing the circle
