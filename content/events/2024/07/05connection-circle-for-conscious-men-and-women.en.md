domestic violence, sexual abuse and toxic family dynamics.  She has

**Rob Nugen** helps ambitious men to discover their gold on a journey into
the divine masculine. He guides men who feel overwhelmed by their past
and the patriarchal way of being to break away from their inner demons
of self-defeat and shame through transformative shadow work, space
holding and circle work. Rob is a TedX speaker, barefoot walker for
over 20 years, trained and run men circles by ManKind Project since
2015 and made the most powerful decision to release himself from a
12 year marriage that had become untenable. Now he's with his dream woman who matches
his values and offers the love he deserves.
