About Your Facilitators

**Jess X Goh** helps burnt out, heart-centered professionals to overcome
the impacts of childhood abuse.  She facilitates this by releasing
anger and grief to reduce their anxiety (drug-free).  What has led
Jess to her spiritual path is to make peace with her traumatic past of
domestic violence, sexual abuse and toxic family dynamics.  She has
manifested her soulmate and business partner and successfully rebuilt
her relationship with her dysfunctional mother and estranged
brother. Jess runs Life In Confidence, an international trauma
recovery practice for over 8 years serving 1000+ high achievers in her
workshops and private programs.

**Rob Nugen** helps ambitious men to discover their gold on a journey into
the divine masculine. He guides men who feel overwhelmed by their past
and the patriarchal way of being to break away from their inner demons
of self-defeat and shame through transformative shadow work, space
holding and circle work. Rob is a TedX speaker, barefoot walker for
over 20 years, trained and run men circles by ManKind Project since
2015 and made the most powerful decision to release himself from a
dysfunctional 12 year marriage to be with his dream woman who matches
his values and offers the love he deserves.
