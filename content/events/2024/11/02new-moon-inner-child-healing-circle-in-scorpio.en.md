FAQ

**#1: Will this work for me?**
<br>Yes, if you allow yourself to be open and receptive to the experience. The resistance comes from being in the mind and the need to control the experience or outcome. If you're someone who's too heady, spend at least 20 minutes in nature with your feet on the ground and move your body to be in the here and now. You will notice you will be far more open to receiving this activation. You may feel tingles, sensations, goosebumps, movement in energy, see images or symbols or you may not feel anything at all. Alternatively, you can start listening to my Childhood Trauma Clearing audio once a day for 30 days or for an extensive clearing 90 days. If you feel called to listen to it longer or at any time, you're welcome to do so as this will keep dissolving the energetics of your childhood conditioning. If you feel you got something from this audio, please email your video or written testimonial to jessxgoh@lifeinconfidence.com.

**#2: What is light language and how does it work?**
<br>It's the language of the soul. Everyone speaks it differently as we channel through these high vibrational codes and frequencies that are being transmuted from the stars to transmute stagnant energy and old frequencies that are no longer in alignment with your soul and to activate dormant parts of you that are needed to bring them into illumination for your highest good.

**#3: Who is this not for?**
<br>This isn't for you if you constantly perceive yourself as a victim, always need to be in control all the time and struggle to trust the natural healing processes facilitated. You don't see yourself as an investment in your healing journey, looking for a quick fix or a way out of life and a skeptic of the spiritual arts as a pathway to move forward.

**#4: Who is this for?**
<br>This is for you if you have tried some form of therapy, spiritual healing or self-development program and you still feel you need extra energetic support in dissolving subconscious or unconscious emotional blockages that are keeping you stuck in the past or stopping you from moving forward in any area of your life.

**#5: How do I get to the venue?**
<br>It is best to take public transport and catch a train to alight at Ikejiri-Ohashi train station. It is a 6 minute walk from the train station to the venue and you need to walk 3 flights of stairs to get to the entrance of the yoga studio. Alternatively, you can catch an Uber to the venue as there is no free parking. If you wish to drive to the venue, there is paid parking near the venue.

**#6: What's your refund policy?**
<br>Tickets are non-refundable but can be transferred or sold to another person who would appreciate this experience. Contact jessxgoh@lifeinconfidence.com their name and contact details so I can prepare them for this event.
