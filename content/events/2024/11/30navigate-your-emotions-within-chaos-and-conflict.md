# Men's Gathering: Navigate Your Emotions Within Chaos And Conflict

Hey brother,

Are you feeling overwhelmed?
<br>Can't find balance in your career and personal life?
<br>Do you struggle to make your partner happy without sacrificing your needs?
<br>Do you constantly face internal chaos, self doubt, and low self worth?
<br>Is it difficult to say no to people, leaving you burned out and distressed?

**What would life look like if you were able to stand in your power?**

# Your Path to Your Inner Kingdom:

As you enter the kingdom of you, uncover your blocks that are
preventing you from putting your needs first without guilt and break
away from the vicious cycles of people-pleasing or avoidance.
Throughout this interactive and experiential workshop, you'll develop
the tools to navigate intense emotions without overwhelm and
communicate your needs and boundaries with clarity and confidence.
You'll discover a sense of inner calm even in the midst of life's
chaos, empowering yourself to create harmony in your work,
relationships, and yourself.

## Grounding Ceremony

Experience a sense of safety as the external world fades away,
allowing you to drop into deeper self-awareness. Let go of the day’s
noise and tension, making space for true inner work.

## Navigating Chaos And Conflict

### Feel the power of your voice

Reclaim your personal authority by setting clear boundaries.
Experience the liberation that comes with standing firm in your truth,
allowing the fear of rejection or conflict to dissolve.  Receive the
deep understanding that your needs matter, and you are worthy of
honoring them.  Watch as hesitation fades and a new confidence takes
root in your being.

### Remain stable during the storm

Experience the gift of stillness and presence, even when the world
around you feels chaotic.  Practice inner calm and clarity, regardless
of what external pressures arise.  Discover your own unwavering
center, allowing you to navigate life's challenges with ease.

## Inner Exploration

### Reconnect with your creativity

Explore childhood patterns that shaped how you handle boundaries
today.  Gain insight into how past experiences of avoidance or
overwork are influencing your present. Receive the healing that comes
from understanding these early imprints and begin releasing what no
longer serves you.

### Express your emotions creatively

Creatively play to process the emotions. Let your creativity flow as a
way to release and integrate the insights you've gained. Feel the
freedom that comes with turning abstract emotions into tangible forms,
and watch as clarity and peace settle into your being.

## Meet Your Kingdom

### Relax into your future self

Anchor everything you’ve learned during the workshop into your body
and mind. Embrace your ideal future self, acting in alignment with
your deepest truth.  Experience the joy, peace, and fulfillment that
come from stepping fully into your power.  Cultivate a clear vision of
who you are becoming.

## Embody Your King

### Step into your Sovereign power

Embody your inner king with confidence and comfort.  Begin to lead
your life with purpose and direction.  Deepen your connection to
yourself and others.

# Questions and Answers

### **Why is this different from other men’s circles?**

I offer a unique approach to emotional connection by creating a safe space for men to fully express themselves. It’s about getting back to basics—fostering real connection and community, where men feel truly heard, seen, and accepted. These events focus on shared experiences, allowing men to explore emotions, boundaries, and connection in real-time, with an emphasis on communication, consent, and physical touch as forms of nurturing rather than therapy. Here, vulnerability feels natural, even in ways that might be uncomfortable in formal settings. The process encourages men to get to know themselves deeply through body awareness, emotional expression, and physical activities. This creates an atmosphere of trust, support, and growth rooted in personal and communal connection, rather than chasing specific therapeutic outcomes.

### **Who is this workshop not for?**

* Those who are looking for a quick fix or for someone else to heal them.
* People who are unwilling to take personal responsibility and prefer to blame others.
* Anyone unwilling to playfully explore their emotional landscape or participate in group activities with an open mind.

### **What happens if I'm not able to attend the workshop?**

When you RSVP, you're making a conscious commitment to yourself to show up 100%. You may transfer or sell your ticket to someone else who can attend.  There are no refunds for this event, unless it is canceled or postponed to a date you cannot attend.

### **How do I get to the venue?**

Ten minute walk from Ikejiri-Ohashi station on Denentoshi Line

### **What facilities will be available at the venue?**

Yoga mats, bolsters, blocks, restroom, changing area, and water will be available.

### **Is there food and beverages available near the venue?**

Yes, there is a grocery store, convenience store, and restaurant within 50 meters of the building.

Rob has been an enormous blessing in my life. His facilitation work, guidance,
and leadership have helped me to sense, understand, express and process my own
emotions. He treats each person as a true individual and listens with openness,
care, and compassion. In my personal experience Rob is excellent at both
counseling and facilitation. He can serve a wide range of clients because he
doesn’t have his own agenda, and pays close attention to the subjective and
personal aspects of one’s emotions, life circumstances, and individual values,
goals, or priorities. Whether you are struggling with overwhelming emotions,
seeking greater self understanding, or simply desire more clarity about the
direction you want to go in life, Rob can provide the space, tools, and support
for you to discover your own wisdom.

Rob you have helped me immensely for a long period of time. And I know that you have a talent for facilitation. In fact everybody in this whole group knows what great facilitation you do and how you are able to tune into people and help them to get through and go on to find the deeper level of their beings.

Rob,

Last week in our breakout room with the Inspiration Process, you worked with me where I was the participant.
I know that you did not follow the script but, whatever you did, it has given me a lasting vision of where
I need to be in terms of getting closer to being in the lover quadrant.  I can’t tell you what you did,
it is simply that I now have a much more relaxed view of how a lover looks at the world and how
I would like to see it, more than just occasionally.

I’m not a strong script follower but I also realize that the script works and can be relied upon to get somewhere.
However, I am also a strong proponent of following wherever the participant wants to take me provided we all have the time.
I felt that you were by my side asking me questions that I understood and, therefore, you were indirectly
forming the vision that I still see today.  It is all very positive for me and you should know that.
That night you had a touch of magic.

I strongly urge you to stick with your counseling vision.  It works……
