**Details**

For light workers, healers and facilitators who are ready to
shine their light in the world and how to prosper from their gifts.

Do you desire to share your soul's work to bring radical
change to the heart and consciousness of humanity?

Are you looking to prosper from your gifts but donâ€™t know
how to financially and sustainably?

Do you struggle to live in two worlds of the material and
the spiritual as a heart-centered leader?

What if you could live abundantly from the truth of who you are?

So many healers, practitioners, light workers and creatives are
struggling to successfully turn their purpose into prosperity.

I decided to put together this free webinar because I want you to succeed
in serving humanity from a place of alignment and abundance.
I know what it's like to struggle in poverty and emotional bankruptcy,
especially starting out in a spiritually based business, the obstacles
and challenges and what it takes to make this a fully fledged career, not a passion project.

We need more light workers to accelerate the rise of consciousness and
elevating the heart of humanity to restore love, compassion, harmony,
collaboration, connection and prosperity in our relationships and communities
to shift the energetics of where the world is heading.

Will you accept this mission to stand in your light and let the world see you?
If you said yes, I'm so excited for you! This is your time to shine!

Here's what you'll learn from this live webinar...

* My entrepreneurial journey from living paycheck to paycheck in corporate
slavery and stuck in my financial karma through ancestral poverty to being
self-made, traveling the world to living a nomadic life and expanding my
work interstate and internationally

* What are the top 5 business mistakes you should avoid as a healer that
diminishes your self-worth (and prosperity frequency!)

* Why you need to restructure your emotional landscape for a thriving
business and how I used this to generate $25K in 1 month

* Experience a light language transmission, high frequencies and guided
quantum meditation to start dislodging and clearing energetic and emotional
blockages held in your energy field, body and consciousness with fear and
insecurities that are in the way of being in alignment with your light

* Q&A, sacred shares and next steps moving forward in my high level 4 month
online mastermind called Divine Prosperity, enrollment is open for
5 heart-centered light leaders only
