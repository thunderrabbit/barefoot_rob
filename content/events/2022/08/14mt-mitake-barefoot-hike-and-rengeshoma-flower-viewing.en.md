## Notes:

It’s about 10 km up and down the mountain.
We’ll go relatively slowly, enjoying nature and conversation.

By joining the event you agree that safety is your own responsibility. You are welcome to wear shoes anytime you need to.

I will be there, rain or shine. Bare feet are waterproof. ;-)
I always recommend self care, so if it’s too hot or humid for you,
no pressure to join this time.
I look forward to seeing you at a future event!
