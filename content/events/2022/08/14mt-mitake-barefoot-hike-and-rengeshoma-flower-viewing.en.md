## Notes:

It’s about 10 km up and down the mountain.
We’ll go relatively slowly, enjoying nature and conversation.

I will be there, rain or shine. Bare feet are waterproof. ;-)
I always recommend self care, so if it’s too hot or humid for you,
no pressure to join this time.
I look forward to seeing you at a future event!
