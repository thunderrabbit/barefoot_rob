March is the month of __PURPOSE__

#### This Week:

Pleasure in our culture is often separated from "purpose"

Pleasure is denigrated in our culture; body/spirit split

We each have natural inclinations toward certain pleasures:
Food, nature, music, the arts, craftsmanship, helping others

How do you find pleasure in your purpose?
