# Summary:

Slow Paced, crowded, Barefoot Hike on Mt Takao

10am July 10th (Sunday, so it will be crowded!)

Takaosanguchi Station

1000 yen

Bring your own lunch and water

We will climb the (mostly paved) Trail 1 of Mt Takao.

# Details:

What to bring:
* Water: enough for yourself (*)
* Your lunch (we will have lunch on the top of the mountain)
* Hat in case of sun
* Rainwear in case of rain
* (Hiking) shoes (please wear shoes whenever you need to!)
* 1000 yen

 Optional:
* Towel, wet tissues for your feet
* First aid supplies
* Sunscreen
* Insect spray
* Picnic sheet, seat pad

After party:
* Bath towel, spare clothes (there is an onsen near Takaosanguchi Station,
  if you want to relax in onsen after the hike).


(*) It takes 100+ minutes to go up Mt Takao (in shoes), so I suspect at least 2-3 hours for us to hike/walk barefoot.  This site says bring 1 liter of water for every 2 hours: https://www.advnture.com/features/water-for-hiking

Insurance:

You can buy insurance from your own provider at your own discrecion.

By joining the hike you agree that safety is your own responsibility, not organizers'.

This event is on, rain or shine.  Only if the trails are closed or trains stopped will the event be canceled.   That said, updates will be posted on this URL until the morning of the event:
