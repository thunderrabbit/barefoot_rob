# Notes:

It's apparently a 3 hour walk from Kamakura to Enoshima, so I suspect it will take a tad longer if we are barefoot.

By joining the event you agree that safety is your own responsibility, not organizers'.
You are welcome to wear shoes anytime you need to.

I will be there, rain or shine.  Bare feet are waterproof.  ;-)
I always recommend self care,
so if it's too hot or wet for you, no pressure to join. üëº

That said, updates will be posted on this URL until the morning of the event:
