We might be able to swim after walking.

# Details:

* Rainwear in case of rain
* 1000 yen

 Optional:
* Towel, wet tissues for your feet
* First aid supplies
* Sunscreen
* Insect spray
* Picnic sheet, seat pad

After party:
* Bath towel, food, soft drinks
* NO alcohol or BBQ allowed on beach!

# Notes:

It's apparently a 3 hour walk from Kamakura to Enoshima, so I suspect it will take a tad longer if we are barefoot.

By joining the event you agree that safety is your own responsibility, not organizers'.

This event is on, rain or shine.  Bare feet are waterproof!

Only if there's a tsunami or trains stopped will the event be canceled.

That said, updates will be posted on this URL until the morning of the event:
