Feel free to bring food to eat while we enjoy the sunset on the beach in Enoshima.

We might have a special guest tour guide from [KSGG](https://volunteerguide-ksgg.jp/)!

# Details:

* Your water or soft drink
* Hat in case of sun
* Rainwear in case of rain
* 1000 yen

 Optional:
* Towel, wet tissues for your feet
* First aid supplies
* Sunscreen
* Insect spray
* Picnic sheet, seat pad

Beach:

While alcohol is not allowed on beach,
we can chill on the beach as we watch the sun set.
Feel free to bring food for after our walk.

# Notes:

It's apparently a 3 hour walk from Kamakura to Enoshima, so I suspect it will take a tad longer if we are barefoot.

By joining the event you agree that safety is your own responsibility.
You are welcome to wear shoes anytime you need to.

I will be there, rain or shine.  Bare feet are waterproof.  ;-)
I always recommend self care,
so if it's too hot or wet for you, no pressure to join this time.
I look forward to seeing you at a future event!

That said, updates will be posted on this URL until the morning of the event:
