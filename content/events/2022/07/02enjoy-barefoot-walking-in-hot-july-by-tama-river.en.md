*Enjoy Grass*

We'll walk on grassy area next to Tama River.

The grass is nice for walking and relaxing.  We sometimes play frisbee on the field!

*Enjoy Breathing*

Get away from it all by settling into your being and noticing the
motions of your body, one breath and one step at a time.

*Stay Updated*
