February is the month of __TRUTH__

#### This Week:

In order to proceed in life cleanly,
we sometimes have to state hard truths to people in our lives -
as well as state them to ourselves.

But we donâ€™t have to SAY them hard.
We can speak our truths either with a sword or a feather -
depending on whom we are speaking to - 
and how they are able to hear us.


#### Costs: ####

~~10,000 yen per month~~

*5,000 yen* per month (intro price until February 28th!)
