#### Create a Portrait of Your Soul

##### The Magnet for Your Dreams

##### workshop

 #art&therapy

Create a powerful collage artwork to make your dreams & wishes come true....

With guidance and the Portrait of the soul art therapy technique you can transform your artwork into a powerful spiritual tool & mirror of your soul...

Let's have fun being creative... Let's dream BIG and use the full potential of the new era...

It's time to focus on yourself... create & invest energy for your life, your wishes, your future...

If we don't have a clear goal or a wish, living life can be similar to walking in a dark forest without a flashlight... which is the right direction, what is the right step to do?

Let's turn on the light of the heart and use your artwork as a compass, a magnet for your dreams...

Let's take steps in 2022 confidently...each step can bring us closer to the meaning of our life...

Experience and learn spiritual techniques how to work with your artwork further...how to make it alive... how to direct energy to make your wish come true...

Have fun with dynamic meditation and enter inside your artwork...

*“If you deeply believe your lucky star,*
*you will become the master of the universe*
*with the power to transform material world*
*as well as your life…”*
