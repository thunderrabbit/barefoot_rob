#### What is a Cuddle Party?

A Cuddle Party is a non-sexual social event
where participants practice communication and
optionally explore platonic touch.
Attendees practice setting clear boundaries,
communicating their desires, and
respecting each others' limits in a safe space.

Cuddle Parties provide an opportunity for nurturing,
platonic touch and intimacy, which supports well-being
and balanced emotions.

While sexual activity is prohibited at Cuddle Parties,
some light touching like hugs, caresses, and
snuggling is allowed between consenting attendees.

At a Cuddle Party, physical contact is optional.
The primary goals of a Cuddle Party are to practice
exploring consent and communication with others.

#### What do we do at a Cuddle Party?

We do two main things at Cuddle Parties:

1. Practice consent.<br>
  A key part of Cuddle Parties is learning
  how to communicate your desires and
  how to respect others' requests.
2. Consensual platonic touch.<br>
  Optionally experience and appreciate
  caring touch from other like-minded people.

We’ll start with an Welcome Circle to get us settled.
We’ll then go through the rules of Cuddle Party
in a mini communication workshop, allowing participants
to practice inner awareness and clear expression of boundaries.

After the communication workshop,
we'll have 2 or more hours of Self-Directed Connection

    Now it is time for you to ask for what you want, say yes and no to
    requests and invitations, cuddle according to your desires and comfort
    (or just talk if you prefer), connect with fascinating people,
    "cuddle mingle," and, ultimately, relax into the flow of an unusually
    playful and respectful social environment.

    Some participants cuddle in groups, others one-on-one,
    while some like to talk and not cuddle for a time, or not at all.
    Cuddling can mean feet against feet, full-body hugs, head-rubs,
    spooning — it is, indeed, up to you.
    And, configurations and positions shift significantly
    throughout the event, thanks in part to Rule 6:
    You are encouraged to change your mind.

We'll finish with a closing circle to reflect on our experience.

#### Benefits

Clear communication allows more harmonious relationships,
regardless of the context.

Nurturing and consensual touch supports a healthy life,
strong nervous system, and balanced emotions.

#### Testimonials

<div>

    It was a great event. Thank you so much.
    Hope more and more people will join the event.
    For us Japanese, we don't communicate that much by hugging,
    but I think people need it. Hugging helps people a lot to be feeling safe.
    It was a great workshop.

    Rob, you are fantastic.
    There really should be more events like this,
    which have great potential to heal this broken world.
    Our society would be so much better if we learned
    this type of communication at school instead of things
    like algebra and geometry that most of us never use and
    forget as soon as the course is over.

    Rob definitely created a safe space for strangers
    coming together at a Cuddle Party to connect with
    one another in a warm, confident, fun, playful and
    loving way. He was able to demonstrate very quickly
    how to use curiousity to explore play and touch in
    an intimate yet platonic setting.
    I had such a fun time, it was beyond my expectation
    of what a Cuddle Party is in my mind. I felt I received
    a lot of healing from receiving and giving affection
    and touch. It was fun to connect with the other
    participants as well.
    I highly recommend this experience to anyone
    who is looking for connection, willing to allow
    their inner child to play and express and receive
    love through the power of touch.
    I definitely will be coming back again!

#### About me, Rob Nugen

I have a passion for connecting with the world around me,
especially walking barefoot. This helps me to stay grounded,
and appreciate the beauty of the present moment.

I established a men’s peer counseling group
in Tokyo in 2015, and conducting in-person
workshops in both Japan and Australia since 2018.

    Rob is amazing. He is a perfect facilitator in every way.
    He is caring, kind, self-effacing, honest. Ten out of ten.
