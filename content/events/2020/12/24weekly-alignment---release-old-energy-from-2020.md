#### Details

As we near the end of 2020, [what energies no longer serve you?](/blog/2020/12/24/weekly-alignment-releasing-old-energy/)  In
this event, we practiced releasing energy that no longer serve
us.  Gratitude and trust are key to knowing what to release and doing
so in a good way.

#### About Weekly Alignments

Weekly Alignments offer tools to get you present with your Self in the now.

At the end of each weekly session, I do a live facilitation to help
someone get clarity about or even overcome an issue in their life.

Weekly Alignments include a lot of channeled material coming from
Source as I receive it in realtime, depending on questions and
comments from the attendees present.
