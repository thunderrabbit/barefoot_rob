#### When

**7pm - 8pm Thursday 17th December 2020**

#### Where

**Zoom** [register](/weekly-alignments/)

#### Details

This coming Thursday for our [Weekly Alignment](/weekly-alignments/)
we will practice how to listen to our Self, as opposed to our
chattering monkey mind.  The Self has all the answers while the monkey
mind has all *its* answers..  How do we tell the difference?

and how to join.
