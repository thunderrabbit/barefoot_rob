#### When

**7pm - 8pm Thursday 17th December 2020**

#### Where

**Zoom** [register](/weekly-alignments/)

#### Details

Do you have negative self talk?

Do you wish you could do things over?

How do you clear through the clutter of your mind?

This coming Thursday for our [Weekly Alignment](/weekly-alignments/)
we will practice how to listen to our Self, as opposed to our
chattering monkey mind.  The Self has all the answers while the monkey
mind has all *its* answers..  How do we tell the difference?

and how to join.

#### About Weekly Alignments

Weekly Alignments offer tools to get you present with your Self on a
daily basis.

At the end of each weekly session, I do a live facilitation to help
someone get clarity about or even overcome an issue in their life.

Weekly Alignments include a lot of channeled material coming from
Source as I receive it in realtime, depending on questions and
comments from the attendees present.
