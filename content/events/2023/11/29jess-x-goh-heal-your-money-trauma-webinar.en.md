I personally know what it's like to be brought up by a hoarding and overspending mother
with a gambling father labourously slaving away selling hardware tools in the markets
and managing a warehouse, which led me to pay for their mortgage until my dad passed away
from a heartache. This led me to rehash my parents' lives into my twenties through a failed
retail business, struggle to cope with having 2 positive cashflow investment properties at
26 and self-sabotage them because I was spiritually bankrupt. I took my chances from ego,
fear and desperation to rescue my mother.I had no real sense of my self-worth or who I was
to be able to keep and accumulate financial abundance. Instead, I would give it away because
that's how I was trained by my mum. I had no real education or wisdom (especially not from
my parents) around how to heal my money trauma and have a real relationship with prosperity.

11 years later, I now operate an international trauma recovery business that enriches
my heart and soul. I get to travel interstate and overseas to share my work
(and meet my soulmate) and live in my current dream destination.

This is all because I choose to be spiritually rich, not materially rich, to create my own
version of a rich life that doesn't follow the status quo of the matrix. Prosperity is more
than what's in your bank account and your investment portfolio, it's an energetic alignment
with your spirit to create the life you want on your terms and how to successfully move
forward through energy flow as your cash flow.

Are you ready to heal and transform your identity with money?

Join me for my free live 2 hour webinar on how to unblock your money traumas from your
childhood upbringing and societal conditioning as you receive downloads and insights into
toxic patterns and fears around money and what to do about it.

Here's what you'll learn...

- Why money isn't what you think it is and how the matrix has capped your innate abundance
of wealth, spiritually and financially

- How your childhood traumas impact your relationship with money and materialism as the
hoarder, gambler, overspender, under earner and risk taker

- Experience my light language transmission, high frequencies and guided quantum meditation
to start clearing energetic and emotional blockages with your money trauma, Q&A, sacred
shares and an invitation to my 4 month money mastermind called Divine Prosperity to
transform your identity around money, upgrade your wealth consciousness and uplevel your
energetic field for abundance to ripple in all areas of your life. This is for 5 spiritual
high achievers only!

Access to the replay for the next 48 hours after the webinar is over (and yes, you can
