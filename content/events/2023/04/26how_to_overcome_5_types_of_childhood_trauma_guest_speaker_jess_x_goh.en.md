**Details**

Does unresolved childhood trauma dictate the way you live your life?

Do you find yourself struggling to find who you are in this world and
form meaningful and genuine connections with the right people?

Are you still reliving your past in the present moment?

Trauma is the imprint of our conditioning and when we don't address it to its core,
we find ourselves thinking, feeling and acting from a place of trauma and pain.
Once we focus on healing the root cause of trauma, not the symptoms that are being
expressed from it such as depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, nightmares, suicidal
thoughts, addictions, toxic relationships, workaholic and so forth, it is then, you
and I can move forward without the emotional baggage anymore.

Learn from a trauma coach trained in 14 healing techniques with real life
experiences of overcoming abuse and delivering breakthrough results for burnt out
heart-centered professionals from domestic violence, sexual abuse, dysfunctional
family dynamics, ancestral trauma and ritual abuse.

"I entered a world I didn't know existed and from it, my health, wellbeing, anxiety
levels, my relationship with my mum and with myself have been transformed. I have
learnt to love myself and understand what trauma has done to me over the years. I
have lowered my dosage of my anxiety tablets and it feels wonderful. I smile more,
I feel happier and I have made peace with many things I have struggled with and feel
I can move forward. Thank you so much to Jessica." - Lucinda Smith Lenander, UK

"I've had the privilege of working with Jess X Goh and it's profound emotional work,
transforming my own childhood trauma, healing my relationship with my mother and
generally moving forward in a really positive way in my life beyond trauma, beyond
stuckness and if you have the opportunity to work with Jessica. I would highly
recommend it. She does incredible work and if you just go for it, take the
opportunity and seize it with both hands." - Benjamin Coggins, AUS
