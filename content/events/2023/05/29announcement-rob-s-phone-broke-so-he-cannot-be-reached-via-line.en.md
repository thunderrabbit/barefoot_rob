Box of books representing out with the old (and in with the new)!

This is a non-event announcement that confirms my phone broke last night.

So I cannot be reached via LINE until I replace my phone, hopefully this week.

I've emailed peeps for whom I might expect a message within the week.

Walking events this weekend are ON even if it rains.

blessings
