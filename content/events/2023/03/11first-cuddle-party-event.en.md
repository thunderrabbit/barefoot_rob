As I near completion of my Cuddle Party facilitation training,
I'm excited to announce my first Cuddle Party event!

Cuddle parties are opportunities for people to experience consensual and
non-sexual touch in a supportive and respectful environment.

Benefits include reduced stress and anxiety,
improved mood, deeper connections with others, and a greater sense of
well-being. They also provide an opportunity to practice communication,
consent, and boundary setting in a supportive and respectful environment.

The event will begin with a presentation of
the [Rules of Cuddle Party](https://cuddleparty.com/cuddle-party-rules/),
including conversation games to foster ease of communication.

Physical touch plays an important role in self-care.
Let's create a space to explore
the benefits of touch in a supportive and respectful environment.
