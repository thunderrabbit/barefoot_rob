I'm excited to announce my first Cuddle Party event!

I understand that not everyone is familiar with this concept;
Cuddle Parties are communication workshops with an option to explore physical touch.

We will create a space together to connect through consensual, non-sexual touch.

All attendees must be willing to respect boundaries,
follow the [Rules of Cuddle Party](https://cuddleparty.com/cuddle-party-rules/),
and be willing accept "no" as an answer without question or explanation.

We take these rules seriously, and I want to make sure everyone feels safe and comfortable at the event.

This event is open to individuals who are interested in exploring
the benefits of touch in a supportive and respectful environment.
I believe physical touch can be an important form of self-care,
and I am committed to creating a space that is supportive and respectful.

If you're interested in attending, please make sure you understand
and are willing to abide by these rules before applying. If you have
any questions, please reach out to me and I'll be happy to help.
