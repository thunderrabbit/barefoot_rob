In 2003, after being in Japan for 3 months,
[I was crying for a hug](https://www.robnugen.com/journal/2003/06/20/hugs/).
I felt incredibly isolated.  As far as I could tell, the only social
life was drinking. I don’t really drink so drinking didn’t appeal to
me.  Yet being in a new culture I didn’t (don’t?) understand and still
want to respect, I didn’t hug anyone.

I slowly found my way to meet people who I could talk to; got a
girlfriend and satisfied my need for physical touch through sex.

Can’t we get physical touch in Japan without sex?

I once saw a man grab a woman’s butt then try to run away.  I grabbed
him and dragged him back, but then she jumped on the train, with
better things to do.

Fast forward many years: I had married Lin and built up a men’s group
where I could get weekly hugs; suddenly a pandemic was announced and
the men’s group moved online.

Three years later, instead of starting a new men’s group in person,
I’m starting a new group and new format for men and women.

[Cuddle Party](https://cuddleparty.com) is an event where people come
together to engage in non-sexual touch and connection. It is a space
where consent is emphasized and participants are encouraged to
communicate their boundaries clearly.

The practice of consensual touch can be beneficial in reducing stress,
increasing oxytocin levels, and promoting feelings of safety and
trust. Cuddle Party offers a way to explore intimacy and connection in
a safe and consensual way. It is also seen as a way to combat
loneliness and social isolation, and to promote a sense of community
and belonging. People of all ages and backgrounds are welcome to
attend Cuddle Party events, and no previous experience is necessary.

I’m nearly finished with my facilitator certification to lead Cuddle Party events.

Cuddle Party?  say What???

Though it’s named for cuddles, one doesn’t have to cuddle at a cuddle party.

We start with an hour long Welcome Circle.

From the Cuddle Party website:

    The Welcome Circle creates a structure and safe space for
    socializing, and helps break the ice so that a group of strangers
    can feel more comfortable with each other. At the Welcome Circle,
    you and other Cuddle Party participants will:

    - Introduce yourselves
    - Learn about the Cuddle Party philosophy
    - Get oriented to the Cuddle Party rules
    - Practice the Cuddle Party communication skills
    - Be led through a few ice-breaker exercises

    By the end of the Welcome Circle, most participants find
    themselves surprised by how comfortable they feel.

I'm excited to announce my first Cuddle Party event!
