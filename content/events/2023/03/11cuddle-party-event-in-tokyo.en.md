In 2003, after being in Japan for 3 months,
[I was crying for a hug](https://www.robnugen.com/journal/2003/06/20/hugs/).
I felt incredibly isolated.  As far as I could tell, the only social
life was drinking, which didn’t appeal to me.

Over time, I slowly found my way to meet people who I could talk to;
got a girlfriend and satisfied my need for physical touch through sex.

Can’t we get physical touch in Japan without sex?

A decade ago, I married Lin and started to build up a men’s group
where I could get weekly hugs; suddenly a pandemic was announced and
the men’s group moved online.

Three years later, instead of starting a new men’s group in person, I
decided to focus on a format where I can offer more space for hugs so
I enrolled in Cuddle Party's training program.

[Cuddle Party](https://cuddleparty.com)
is an organization in the US, facilitating events where people come
together to connect in non-sexual touch and connection.

Cuddle Party events emphasize consent and participants are encouraged
to communicate their boundaries clearly.

The practice of consensual touch can be beneficial in reducing stress,
increasing oxytocin levels, and promoting feelings of safety and
trust.

Cuddle Party offers a way to explore intimacy and connection in a safe
and consensual way. It is also seen as a way to combat loneliness and
social isolation, and to promote a sense of community and belonging.

Adults of all ages and backgrounds are welcome to attend Cuddle Party
events, and no previous experience is necessary.

Cuddle Party?  say What???

Though it’s named for cuddles, one doesn’t have to cuddle at a cuddle party.

We start with an hour long Welcome Circle.

From the Cuddle Party website:

    The Welcome Circle creates a structure and safe space for
    socializing, and helps break the ice so that a group of strangers
    can feel more comfortable with each other. At the Welcome Circle,
    you and other Cuddle Party participants will:

    - Introduce yourselves
    - Learn about the Cuddle Party philosophy
    - Get oriented to the Cuddle Party rules
    - Practice the Cuddle Party communication skills
    - Be led through a few ice-breaker exercises

    By the end of the Welcome Circle, most participants find
    themselves surprised by how comfortable they feel.
