#### Details

*Enjoy Nature*

Kinuta Park is famous for its cherry blossom (sakura) viewing.
It has at least three varieties:
Someiyoshino, Yamazakura, and Yaezakura.
This makes for a relatively long hanami viewing season of over two weeks.

*Enjoy Connection*

Get away from it all by settling into your being and noticing the
motions of your body, one breath and one step at a time.

What to Expect:

* I will talk about how to safely walk barefoot.
* We will feel asphalt, grass, and myriad other surfaces.
* Let's enjoy discovering the park together!
* Time for hanami lunch (bring your lunch; I'll bring tarps)
