Join us for yummy food and deep connection at [The Pink Cow](https://www.thepinkcow.com/)
on Saturday, February 28th!
I’ll be leading a **one‑hour workshop inspired by my book *I’M FINE***
at [The Pink Cow](https://www.thepinkcow.com/) in Akasaka.

We’ll begin with
- placing our orders from their delicious California-Mexican menu,
- before connecting with a **simple check‑in circle**,
- enjoy a few **gentle, engaging activities focused on emotional awareness**

I’ll also read a short section from my book… featuring my **rarely‑heard Texan accent** 🤠

This is an **easy, welcoming introduction** to the kind of work
I do with men and mixed groups:
noticing what’s happening behind "I’m fine"
