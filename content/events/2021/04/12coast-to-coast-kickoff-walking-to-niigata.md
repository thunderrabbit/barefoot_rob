#### When

**9am or so Monday 12 April 2021**

#### Where

**[Rinko Park in Yokohama](https://goo.gl/maps/ZB2C79ye578aapX26)**

#### Details

Might as well make it a coast to coast walk, starting at the coast in Yokohama!

On April 12th 2021, I plan to walk barefoot ~20km to my house from
Rinko Park in Yokohama.  Join me for any or all of the walk!

Google shows it will take less than 5 hours to walk, so we can
probably easily do it with just 1 or 2 breaks for snacks / lunch.
