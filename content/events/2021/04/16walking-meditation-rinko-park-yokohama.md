Refresh your spirit. Touch the earth. Connect with nature.

Walking Meditation Experience:

Meditation, walking, breathing, enjoying crisp air.

#### When

**9am Friday 16 April 2021**

#### Where

**[Rinko Park in Yokohama](https://goo.gl/maps/ZB2C79ye578aapX26)**

#### Details

Let's enjoy a morning walking meditation in Rinko Park!
This will be a chance to feel grounded and connected to the ocean.

This will be the
first
"official" Walking Meditation event during Barefoot Rob's walk across Japan.

Enjoy meditative motion, sea breeze, and hopefully sunshine.

#### Bonus!

After the meditation,
I plan to
walk barefoot ~20km from Rinko Park in Yokohama to my house in Kawasaki.  Join me
for any or all of the walk!

Google shows it will take less than 5 hours to walk, so we can
probably easily do it with just 1 or 2 breaks for snacks / lunch.
