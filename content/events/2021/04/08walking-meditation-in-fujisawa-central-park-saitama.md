Third Annual Chilly Challenge: Barefoot Rob Walking Meditation

Join us again in Yoyogi Park!  February is usually the chilliest month
of the year in Tokyo.

* Wear layers,
* keep yourself warm,
* take off your shoes,
* enjoy feeling *alive*!

*Enjoy Nature*

Yoyogi Park has lots of big beautiful trees surrounding its large grassy field.

*Enjoy Breathing*

Get away from it all by settling into your being and noticing the
motions of your body, one breath and one step at a time.

11:45am Meet at Harajuku Gate of Yoyogi Park  https://goo.gl/maps/xabS6Nw7TgNScqeCA

12:00 noon: Enter Yoyogi Park

What to Expect:

* We will meet at 11:45 and by noon decided where to go.
* If it's warm, we will find a nice place in the big field past the fountains or a dry area.
* I will guide us in meditation, including walking meditation.
* Feel free to take off your shoes; whatever makes you comfortable.

Though chilly, the weather will likely be great for walking, so let's
mindfully walk slowly around the loop and arrive back at the clock by
about 13:30.

Some of us will go somewhere (TBD) in Harajuku afterward to eat and
warm up.  You are welcome to join!

**Costs:**

free!

**What to bring**

It will likely be quite cold, so wear layers to keep yourself
comfortable.  Come wearing lightweight shoes and maybe a bag for them
just in case you need to put them on during the walk!

Self care is important, so wear shoes whenever you need to!
