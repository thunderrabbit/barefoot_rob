Refresh your spirit. Touch the earth. Connect with nature.

Walking Meditation Experience:

Meditation, walking, breathing, enjoying crisp air.

#### When

**9am or so Friday 16 April 2021**

#### Where

**[Rinko Park in Yokohama](https://goo.gl/maps/ZB2C79ye578aapX26)**

#### Details

Let's enjoy a morning walking meditation in Rinko Park!
This will be a chance to feel grounded and connected to the ocean.

Enjoy meditative motion, sea breeze, and hopefully sunshine.

#### Bonus!

After the meditation,
I plan to
walk barefoot ~20km from Rinko Park in Yokohama to my house in Kawasaki.  Join me
for any or all of the walk!

Google shows it will take less than 5 hours to walk, so we can
probably easily do it with just 1 or 2 breaks for snacks / lunch.
