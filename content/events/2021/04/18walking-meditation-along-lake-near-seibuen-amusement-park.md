*Enjoy Breathing*

Get away from it all by settling into your being and noticing the
motions of your body, one breath and one step at a time.

#### What to Expect:

* We will walk from 17:30pm until about 18:30.
* Our destination station is different than the starting point!
* I will guide us in meditation, including walking meditation.
* Feel free to take off your shoes; whatever makes you comfortable.

Though it may get chilly in the evening, the weather will likely be great for walking.

**Costs:**

free! (donations accepted)

**What to bring**

You may want to wear layers to keep yourself
comfortable.  Come wearing lightweight shoes and maybe a bag for them
just in case you need to put them on during the walk!

Self care is important, so wear shoes whenever you need to!
