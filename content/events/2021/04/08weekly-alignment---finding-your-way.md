#### About Weekly Alignments

[Weekly Alignments](/weekly-alignments/) offer tools to get you present with your Self in the now.

At the end of each weekly session, I do a live facilitation to help
someone get clarity about or even overcome an issue in their life.

Weekly Alignments include a lot of channeled material coming from
Source as I receive it in realtime, depending on questions and
comments from the attendees present.
