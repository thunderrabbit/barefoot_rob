#### Details

This will be the
second
"official" Walking Meditation event during Barefoot Rob's walk across Japan.

*Enjoy Nature*

We will spend about 45 minutes in [Higashimurayama Chuo Park](https://goo.gl/maps/KuXtp2u1ZGeWv9bc9), which looks like it has lots of space surrounded by trees and greenery.

*Enjoy Breathing*

Get away from it all by settling into your being and noticing the
motions of your body, one breath and one step at a time.

14:00pm Meet outside the [community center](https://goo.gl/maps/isFiuifJALBYSKWB6) (closest station:

#### What to Expect:

* We will walk from 14:15pm until about 15:00.
* I will guide us in meditation, including walking meditation.
* Feel free to take off your shoes; whatever makes you comfortable.
* Welcome to continue walking and join [5pm walking meditation event](/events/2021/04/18walking-meditation-along-lake-near-seibuen-amusement-park/)

The weather will likely be great for walking, though it may get chilly if you join us for the [5pm walking meditation event](/events/2021/04/18walking-meditation-along-lake-near-seibuen-amusement-park/)!

**Costs:**

free! (donations accepted)

You may want to wear layers to keep yourself

just in case you need to put them on during the walk!

Self care is important, so wear shoes whenever you need to!
