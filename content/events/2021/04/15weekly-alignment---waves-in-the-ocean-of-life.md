#### Details

Have you ever just watched waves?  Were you ever worried about missing a particular wave after it melts back into the water?  There will always be more waves.  Always more opportunities to live-play-love-laugh-cry-sing-do-be-do-be-do Enjoy each wave of energy and each wave of life as it comes.  It will soon be gone, and yet we need not hold on.  There will always be another wave.

#### About Weekly Alignments

[Weekly Alignments](/weekly-alignments/) offer tools to get you present with your Self in the now.

At the end of each weekly session, I do a live facilitation to help
someone get clarity about or even overcome an issue in their life.

Weekly Alignments include a lot of channeled material coming from
Source as I receive it in realtime, depending on questions and
comments from the attendees present.
