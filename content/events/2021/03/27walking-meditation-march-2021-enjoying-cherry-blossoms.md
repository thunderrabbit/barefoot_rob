#### Details

What to Expect:

Join us in Yoyogi Park! Late March 2021 will likely feature cherry blossoms as Spring comes once again.

If the weather is nice, we plan to have a picnic in the park. Bring your own food and let's enjoy the lovely cherry blossoms.

Wear layers,
<br>keep yourself warm,
<br>enjoy cherry blossoms,
<br>enjoy feeling alive!

**Enjoy Nature**

Yoyogi Park has lots of big beautiful trees surrounding its large grassy field.

**Enjoy Breathing**

Get away from it all by settling into your being and noticing the motions of your body, one breath and one step at a time.

#### Costs:

free!

#### What to bring

* It will likely be quite cold, so wear layers to keep yourself comfortable.

* Bring lunch if you want to eat with us after the walking meditation.

* Come wearing lightweight shoes and maybe a bag for them just in case you need to put them on during the walk!

Self care is important, so wear shoes whenever you need to!
