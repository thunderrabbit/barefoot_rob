#### Details

After [clearing away energies which no longer serve
us](/blog/2020/12/24/weekly-alignment-releasing-old-energy/) we have
chance to bring in new excitement and balance into life.  Join us for
deep introspection and claiming your inner power so that you can bring
it forth throughout the year.

#### About Weekly Alignments

[Weekly Alignments](/weekly-alignments/) offer tools to get you present with your Self in the now.

At the end of each weekly session, I do a live facilitation to help
someone get clarity about or even overcome an issue in their life.

Weekly Alignments include a lot of channeled material coming from
Source as I receive it in realtime, depending on questions and
comments from the attendees present.
