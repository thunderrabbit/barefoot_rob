#### Details

(Welcome to 2021! Art discussion in English)

Do you want a chance to show your work and talk about it in a casual,
friendly, and supportive environment?

Do you want encouragement from fellow artists to push your creativity
further?

This discussion group is to inspire and encourage people to engage our
everyday beauty in our ordinary life to keep exercising our creativity
and healthy mind.

It is not a professional art discussion.  Beginners are welcome.

It is not about competition. We explore our inner artists. We are all
hidden artists who work at offices during the week.

Let your imagination run free on the weekends and meet your essence:
to create and be creative.

We share and discuss our paintings, drawings, illustration or any art
form made from multiple media (hand-carryable size).

Bring your art for show and tell!
