Once we've gotten a good start on 2021, let's continue practicing good mental and spiritual self care.

*Enjoy Nature*

Shinjuku Gyoen is a beautiful park just 15 minutes walking distance from
the busiest train station in the world.

Covering 144 acres, Shinjuku Gyoen blends three distinct styles,
Formal Garden, Landscape Garden, and Japanese Traditional Garden.

*Enjoy Breathing*

Get away from it all by settling into your being and noticing the
motions of your body, one breath and one step at a time.

What to Expect:

* We will find a nice place to relax and connect with nature and inner quiet.
* I will guide us in meditation, including walking meditation.
* Feel free to take off your shoes; whatever makes you comfortable.

I plan for the weather to be nice, so let's stay in the park until
14:30 and then decide what we want to do after that.

**Costs:**

500 yen for Shinjuku park

**What to bring**

It will likely be quite cold, so wear layers to keep yourself comfortable.
Come wearing lightweight shoes that you can carry just in case you
need to put them on during the walk!

Self care is important, so wear shoes whenever you need to!
