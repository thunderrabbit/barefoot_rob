Barefoot Walking Experience:

Meditation, walking, breathing, enjoying crisp air.

#### Details

Once we've gotten a good start on 2021, let's remember to get a good start on mental and spiritual self care.

*Enjoy Nature*

*Enjoy Breathing*

Shinjuku Gyoen is a beautiful park 15 minutes walking distance from
the busiest train station in the world.

Get away from it all by settling into your being and noticing the
motions of your body, one breath and one step at a time.

Covering 144 acres, Shinjuku Gyoen blends three distinct styles,
Formal Garden, Landscape Garden, and Japanese Traditional Garden.

What to Expect:

* We will find a nice place to relax and connect with nature and inner quiet.
* I will guide us in meditation, including walking meditation.
* Feel free to kick off your shoes; whatever makes you comfortable.

I plan for the weather to be nice, so let's stay in the park until
14:30 and then decide what we want to do after that.

**What to bring**

Come wearing lightweight shoes that you can carry just in case you
need to put them on during the walk!

Self care is important, so wear shoes whenever you need to!
