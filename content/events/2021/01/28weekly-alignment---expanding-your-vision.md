#### Details

After we [got aligned with your inner spirit](/blog/2021/01/21/weekly-alignment-recognize-your-magnificence/) this week we [discovered just how big a vision you can create](/blog/2021/01/28/weekly-alignment-healing-your-body-and-expand-heart-vision/) for yourself.

#### About Weekly Alignments

[Weekly Alignments](/weekly-alignments/) offer tools to get you present with your Self in the now.

At the end of each weekly session, I offer a live facilitation to help
someone get clarity about or even overcome an issue in their life.

Weekly Alignments include a lot of channeled material coming from
Source as I receive it in realtime, depending on questions and
comments from the attendees present.
