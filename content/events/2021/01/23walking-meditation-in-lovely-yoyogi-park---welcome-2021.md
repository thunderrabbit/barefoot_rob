Thank you all for coming out today, braving the sprinkle and embracing the chill!  Adrien came wearing *shorts* and immediately joined me in barefoot style.  Max and Ayako joined us soon thereafter and also joined Team Barefoot!

Thanks to Sachiko for ensuring we enjoyed walking in Yoyogi Park.  We walked mindfully to the fountains and then turned left to walk mindfully around the loop.

Thank you leaves for being soft and light!

Coming soon: pictures of leaf-covered feet!

Clare joined as soon as she could after fixing a complimentary flat tire on her bicycle.

Thank you Amaru for choosing the pancake restaurant, and to Adrien and Max for recommending various spiritual guides and healers.

Thank you chilly sprinkle for staying above freezing so no one slipped!

What to Expect:

* We will meet at 11:45 and by noon decided where to go.
* We will find a nice place in the big field past the fountains or a dry area.
* I will guide us in meditation, including walking meditation.
* Feel free to take off your shoes; whatever makes you comfortable.

Despite today's forecast, I plan for the weather to be nice, so let's stay in the park until
14:30 and then decide what we want to do after that.

**Costs:**

free!

**What to bring**

It will likely be quite cold, so wear layers to keep yourself comfortable.
Come wearing lightweight shoes that you can carry just in case you
need to put them on during the walk!

Self care is important, so wear shoes whenever you need to!
