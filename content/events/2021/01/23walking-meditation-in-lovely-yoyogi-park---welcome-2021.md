Thank you all for coming out today, braving the sprinkle and embracing the chill!  Adrien came wearing *shorts* and immediately joined me in barefoot style.  Max and Ayako joined us soon thereafter and also joined Team Barefoot!

Thanks to Sachiko for ensuring we enjoyed walking in Yoyogi Park.  We walked mindfully to the fountains and then turned left to walk mindfully around the loop.

Thank you leaves for being soft and light!

Clare joined as soon as she could after fixing a complimentary flat tire on her bicycle.

Thank you Amaru for choosing the pancake restaurant, and to Adrien and Max for recommending various spiritual guides and healers.

Thank you chilly sprinkle for staying above freezing so no one slipped!

14:30 and then decide what we want to do after that.
