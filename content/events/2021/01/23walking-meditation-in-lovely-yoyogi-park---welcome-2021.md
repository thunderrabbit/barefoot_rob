What to Expect:

* We will meet at 11:45 and by noon decided where to go.
* We will find a nice place in the big field past the fountains or a dry area.
* I will guide us in meditation, including walking meditation.
* Feel free to take off your shoes; whatever makes you comfortable.

Despite today's forecast, I plan for the weather to be nice, so let's stay in the park until
14:30 and then decide what we want to do after that.

**Costs:**

free!

**What to bring**

It will likely be quite cold, so wear layers to keep yourself comfortable.
Come wearing lightweight shoes that you can carry just in case you
need to put them on during the walk!

Self care is important, so wear shoes whenever you need to!
