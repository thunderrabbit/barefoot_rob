#### Details

*Enjoy Nature*

Tama River has lots of walkways and often grass along its banks.

*Enjoy Breathing*

Get away from it all by settling into your being and noticing the
motions of your body, one breath and one step at a time.

11:45am Meet at Izumi-Tamagawa Station near benches https://goo.gl/maps/4yh8TLgADixQYnzU8

12:00 noon: Walk toward Tama River

Walk around the grass for a bit, then possibly walk along the river.  Watch for little rocks!

**Costs:**

500 yen

**What to bring**

Whatever you need to take care of yourself.  Bring lightweight
shoes and maybe a bag for them if you want to carry them while walking!

Self care is important, so wear shoes whenever you need to!

**Covid Considerations**

You know the drill.  I know you have thought about it and I trust you
to make a good decision for yourself.  For a group strictly wearing masks,
I recommend https://www.meetup.com/tokyospontaneous
