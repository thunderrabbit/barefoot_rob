**Costs:**

500 yen, includes alcohol and rags for wiping feet clean

**What to bring**

Whatever you need to take care of yourself.  Come wearing lightweight
shoes and maybe a bag for them just in case you need to put them on
during the walk!

Self care is important, so wear shoes whenever you need to!

**Covid Considerations**

You know the drill.  I know you have thought about it and I trust you
to make a good decision for yourself.  If you want a group with masks,
