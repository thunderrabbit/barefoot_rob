#### Details

As we go through life, we often see ourselves in others.  Why does this happen?  How can we recognize it?

Projecting ourselves into the world can cause misunderstandings, heartbreak, and worse.  How do we bridge the gap?

What if we aren't even aware of the gap?

#### About Weekly Alignments

[Weekly Alignments](/weekly-alignments/) offer tools to get you present with your Self in the now.

At the end of each weekly session, I do a live facilitation to help
someone get clarity about or even overcome an issue in their life.

Weekly Alignments include a lot of channeled material coming from
Source as I receive it in realtime, depending on questions and
comments from the attendees present.
