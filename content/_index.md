# Connect with earth, and yourself

Online home of Barefoot Rob Nugen

For 21 years, I've been walking barefoot whenever possible.  What started as simple enjoyment for me has turned into more passion as I realize the many health benefits of walking barefoot.

Societally, we have been encouraged to enclose our feet in too small shoes.
Though they may be fashionable,
this causes all variety of problems,
from

Barefooting is the way to be.  Bare feet help us balance more naturally,
as toes have more leverage to balance us if they are given more space to spread out.  
Plus having more nerve endings on the ground gives more detail to the brain about how to balance.
