I was afraid to be a man.  

In 1997, I attended ManKind Project’s New Warrior Training Adventure in Texas.  That was the start of my personal growth.  

At age 27, I still thought of myself as a boy. I did not want to grow up.  I didn’t want the responsibility.  Or the conflict.

I had seen adults in my life always unhappy in various ways, especially in relationships.

I realized I needed a community where I could feel heard.

Since then, 2 things have happened:

#1:
<br>I moved to Japan and subsequently started a peer counseling group for men who share about their struggles.

While attending the group, I have seen men move from...

🔻 Being unable to leave the house →🟢 Feeling in control of life, working full time, and proud to be able to take care of his family again.   
<br>🔻 Unable to cope in the darkness of depression →🟢 Functioning on their highest level
<br>🔻 Shame-induced suicidal ideations → 🟢 Living courageously again.  
But I didn’t expect this...  

#2:
<br>Women have started to ask if there’s a group they can join.

People began asking me, “Rob, I want to do it, but my partner isn’t interested.”  

“How do I get them to understand?   … to really hear me?”

I didn’t have a good answer or easily accessible resources for that.

But now I'm putting together a training on exactly that. Soon I'll be
doing a mini workshop

###  “How to have one clear and safe conversation to feel heard & get what you need. Without drama.”

All the details are coming next week!

Email me, call me, find me if you think you'd like to attend.
