A few rules that help light my path:

* Walk with kindred spirits.  I walk barefoot.  Most people don’t.  They don’t have to walk barefoot, but if I'm not accepted for how I show up, it’s best to not work/continue together. 
* Seek your own inner guidance.  Feelings are a well-honed natural guidance system for life. Hear AniKiko’s "[Follow the Whispers](https://open.spotify.com/track/3xmrEEOGLW40L4CtnHa65P)"
* Play hard.  Beastie Boys said "My work is my play cause I'm playing when I work"
* Do the right thing.   We are playing a long game.  Prioritize long term thinking over short term gain.
* Get N’Sync. "You don’t have to be alone." Work with a partner.  I tend to spiral off course otherwise.
* Be selfish as needed.  It’s OK to take care of yourself.  If I am not feeling well, I cannot safely support others.
