Do you want to just get something out of your system?  Talk with an
empathetic human?  Just vent?

Reach out to me.

I offer my direct attention via Zoom/Skype/Telegram/phone for up to an
hour, you write a public testimonial (or pay 10,000 yen if that is
simpler for you).

All confidential, and I am not a counselor so I have no reporting
requirements.

Message me to arrange a time.
