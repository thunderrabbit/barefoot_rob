Hale, Jr., M.D. Director, Albany Hospital Albany, N.Y.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>. . . practically all shoes worn daily by men and women in our Western civilization
  have little relation to the shape of the human foot . . .&quot;</p>
  <p>. . . most adults' foot trouble would either not exist or would be much less bothersome
  if properly-shaped shoes had been worn during childhood or, better yet, if those people
  had gone barefoot . . .</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>. . .&nbsp; I asked an older physician on the hospital staff what he thought could be
  done to cure foot trouble. &quot;Foot troubles are chronic conditions people have had for
  a long time,&quot; he advised. &quot;You'll waste your time trying to find their cause and
  cure. Be content just to give people all the relief you possibly can.&quot; . . .</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>. . . as I traveled about the interior of the island where many of the people are
  habitually barefooted, I was amazed to find that they all had straight, undeformed toes,
  unlike the shoe-confined toes I had seen and treated in the United States . . .</p>
  <p>. . . I read a number of studies which, together with what I had seen, proved to me
  that habitually barefooted people do not acquire our foot troubles . . .</p>
  <p>. . . Besides having sturdy toes and muscular feet, the people who were constantly
  barefooted did not have fallen arches . . .<br>

<blockquote>
  <p>. . .&nbsp; His toes were being forced together in narrow shoes . . . He tired easily,
  always wanted to be carried, and fell frequently when walking . . . his toes [were] so
  weak he could hardly bend them . . .</p>
  <p>. . . Remembering the healthy feet and strong toes of the people who were constantly
  barefooted, I suggested the child wear no shoes for the rest of the summer . . .</p>
  <p>. . .&nbsp; an amazing thing happened. He finally stopped leaning on his arches; he
  started to walk straighter and more normally . . .</p>

  ills . . .</p>

  <p>. . . About 1915 a wave of reform began to take place . . . people had only to squeeze
  their toes into a space about one half the proper breadth. While this was an improvement,
  it was not great enough to prevent deformation of the feet . . .</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>. . . If a lesson about foot trouble can be learned from history, it is that we are at
  the mercy of the latest shoe styles . . . fashion has dictated a return to the
  pointed-toed shoes of fifty years ago . . . As a result, the bunions and compressed toes
  of our grandparents are again being formed in children's feet . . . </p>

<ul>
  <p>. . . I spent a day in such a shoe store observing the operation. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;How can you sell these corrective shoes,&quot; I asked the owner. &quot;You
    insist on the necessity of 'arch cookies,' 'cuboids,' 'metatarsal supports,' and so on-yet
    from the continuous complaints of customers, you know that these supports are of no help
    to the feet. How do you justify this?&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;It's a wonderful living,&quot; the owner commented. &quot;Besides, I always
    instruct them to do certain exercises. They never do them. When they complain too much
    about their feet, I say, 'Well, did you do the exercises?'&nbsp; That usually shuts them
    up.&quot; . . .</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>. . . Dr. Lee Bivings, a pediatrician from Atlanta, estimates 99% of new born babies
  have perfectly normal feet - and in his clinic more than 6o% of these same, shoe-wearing
  babies have acquired foot disabilities at six years of age . . .</p>
