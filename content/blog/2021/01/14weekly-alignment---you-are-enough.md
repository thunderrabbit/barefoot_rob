Tonight we dove deep into the ways that you are enough, breaking free
from confusing affirmations, to opening up a flow of inate qualities
through simple questions like "in what ways am I enough?"  "what parts of
me are enough?"

    For today's program, more grounded focus as a starting point as
    always, and then building the base to find who you need to be in
    order to do the things you want to do.

    Do you still have the list from last last time? okay excellent.

    I like to have this as a continuing unfolding uh as we as we go
    along.

    So with your list available, take a moment to just relax.

    Notice your breathing and allow your consciousness to settle into
    your body.

    When you feel yourself completely settled and in a clear space,
    allow yourself to open your eyes and just look on the list.

    Find one item that draws your attention.

    One of your long-term goals or projects that you have in mind.

    And we focused on imagining a future version of ourselves who has
    already completed a goal, and it may be the same one, maybe a
    different one that you choose today.

    But given that the goal is already completed in a future version
    of your reality, feel the energy that is in you already that will
    help you achieve this goal.

    Breathe into those parts of yourself that support you within this
    process of achieving your goal.

    These are the things that come naturally for you.

    These may be things that other people admire in you.

    They may be your super powers that we looked at in one of the
    first calls.

    Notice the things that you already possess that will support you
    in achieving this goal.

    And as you have these qualities coming to mind, maybe you can
    create a mind map with your goal written in the center, and the
    qualities outside which will branch out into different to do lists
    that help support the achieving of this goal.

    So writing on a new page, "I am enough" in the center...

    Allow this phrase to roll through your mind a few times "I am
    enough, I am enough," and it may begin to sound inauthentic "I am
    enough, " and it's like what's going on?

    So then we adjust the phrase a bit to be a question so the mind
    can grab on to the answers here.

    So rolling the question in your mind:

    "What parts of me are enough?"

    Allow your mind to grab into this question, to chew on this
    question.

    "What parts of me are enough?"


    Let yourself write those down freely without thinking.

    Just run that question "what parts of me are enough?"  over and
    over in your mind.

    Let the answers begin to spill out.


    To restart the cycle you may rephrase "in what ways am I enough?"

    Look at those that come up from those questions in your mind,
    recognizing the truth of each one.

    Feeling in your heart the truth: this part of me is enough.

    These are some ways I'm enough.

    Allowing that knowing to sink into your body...  and allowing the
    knowing of your body to percolate up into the mind.


    For the next week, allow yourself to practice this exercise,
    rolling in your mind the question

    "in what ways am I enough" and just write those down.

    Write down the words that come, and it could be the same words as
    the previous day.

    I'm sure new words will come as well.

    You may be surprised at the words that come.

    Your body knows it. Your heart knows it.  Allow your mind to know
    it too:

    You are enough.

    You're absolutely enough.

    Enjoy the discovery, finding the ways that you are blessed and the
    ways that you bless the world around you.

    Namaste.

    See you next week.

    My pleasure. Thank you.  Absolutely.
