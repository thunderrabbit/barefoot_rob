Do you have plans, but not sure how to get started?  Ask someone who
has done it: your future self!

As you live in a holographic universe, your consciousness can tap into
any point in time or space.

Use that to your advantage with the meditation below.

    As we get started, just noticing how you're feeling in this moment,
    just a casual check in about the transition you've experienced from,
    uh, last year into this year, what goals or ideas you have within the
    new year that we're starting now?

    Recognizing all of those things that you mentioned and recognizing the
    options that we have going forward in this year, allow yourself to
    just recognize this present moment... and allow the idea of
    possibilities in 2021 to come into your mind. Just take a few minutes
    to write down the possibilities and the new year as you see them in
    this moment.

    So choose one of the items on your list, and you may want to do this
    process for each different one.

    Imagine the future version of you having completed this item, taking a
    moment to really settle into the vision of yourself successfully
    completing this item or completing this project, recognizing where you
    are located. Noticing the people around you and feeling in your body,
    how it feels to have completed this very important goal. Allow
    yourself to see the version of yourself who has successfully completed
    this task, completed this goal. Take a minute to sit down with that
    future version of yourself, asking your future self for any insights
    or ideas on just how they were able to accomplish this.

    Make note of the replies that come.

    Really allow yourself to connect with that part of you who has
    finished this project.

    Maybe asking what obstacles came up and how were you able to get
    around them?

    What type of regular cadence did you get into to finish this project?

    What support did you have from people around you and the universe at
    large?

    What did you do to receive that support?

    What things surprised you during the completion of this project

    And thanking your future self for the answers so far, ask if there's
    anything else that you should know about this project.

    Again, thanking your future self for the time and for completing the
    project successfully, allow them to go back into the future and allow
    yourself to come back into this present moment.

    I'm curious what insight you received from your future self.

    Letting yourself tap into that resource at any time, with gratitude,
    visualizing the positive outcome and tapping into that version of the
    future.

    Recognizing that as we are all one, there is only the now.

    You can tap into any different version of the universe and move
    yourself that direction with your intention and your focus, with your
    belief and your trust.

    And you're allowing the ultimate creative force in the universe to
    move through you as you are creating your life in each and every
    moment.

    Expressing gratitude to those parts of yourself and to that ultimate
    creative force, creative energy.

    And I bless you in your adventure. Absolutely.

    So, yeah, that's the, the beauty of this moment. We can tap into any,
    any part of the holographic universe in the moment.

    My pleasure, absolutely.

    Good to see you tonight. And I look forward to seeing you next week
    and we'll continue the the show..

    I'll be downloading more channeled info, channeled content, each week
    as we do this. So I'm glad you enjoyed it.
