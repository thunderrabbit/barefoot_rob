Last week, using questions like "what parts of me are enough?" we
discovered myriad ways even our minds can understand we are enough.

This week, looking from a spiritual perspective, our enough-ness is a
given.

    "Of course you are enough.  I made you."
    - God

    Recognizing you are enough is sometimes a trick to the ego,
    thinking "oh you didn't do this right, you didn't do that right,
    you've got to do this or that," and yet on the spiritual plane
    it's like a given that everything is perfect.
    
    You are enough to such a point that that's not even something that
    God talks about.

    It's like "what are you talking about of course you're enough; I
    made you." kind of kind of level.

    So there's like a conflict between the ego trying to prove itself
    and to keep its job versus the spiritual being living in a world
    full of egos that are all trying to keep their prospective jobs.
   
    How do we continue to recognize this truth of being enough despite
    the ego saying we're not enough, tv saying we're not enough,
    competition inadvertent or not, when different people have cooler
    houses or you know longer you know selfie sticks so it's like all
    these different competitions kind of happen and that is in a way,
    that's the downfall of our belief or not even belief but downfall
    of realizing that we are enough.
    
    How does this conflict play out in your life? or What are some
    ways that you notice the conflict? or How do you handle it?  What
    do you notice about this happening in your life?
    
    I may have mentioned it before, that people love to see
    vulnerability and hate to be vulnerable.  This is coming from uh
    uh what's her name? I have the book right here She did it. Brene
    Brown.  This _Daring Greatly_ book I think it's from this book
    that she mentioned that maybe her other book that

    You are compassionate for those people on the the podcast that are
    experiencing whatever troubles in their life and sharing that with
    the the podcast per who is what's the name of the podcast over
    over and on with it so they're they're sharing their situation
    with christine and in 45 minutes like really putting themselves
    out into the into the open and seeing that benefit that it's
    similar to something that you've experienced and just reminds me
    that having the courage to be vulnerable helps other people maybe
    more than we understand so yeah that's something that I want to
    remind myself to be vulnerable to give permission and to model
    being vulnerable to uh the public or I don't know what it may look
    like in any different any certain situation but
    
    I'm asking the question to get a sense of how to lead a meditation
    type process for today.
    
    As always having your pen handy pen and paper handy to write down
    any insights.  Great.  and starting with last week's recognition
    that you are enough in many different ways remembering in what
    ways am I enough what are some ways I am enough recalling those
    answers you may want to write down any new answers if they come
    now and while you're feeling the enoughness as given from the
    universe and the higher highest connection to to god or spirit as
    you know it stay within that feeling of enoughness and maybe just
    remember a little bit of the messages that you may have heard in
    the past allow them to be very faint just so you can remember what
    they were while you remain in this clear awareness of enough just
    as you are simply be in this awareness of I am noticing the very
    faint old messages that try to say otherwise you should or you
    didn't or whatever they may be trying to say remain grounded and
    fully immersed I am energy of enoughness notice your breathing
    breathing smoothly flowing with energy of enough being here in
    your full spiritual glory within this human experience fully
    recognizing you are enough breathing into your chest notice the
    glow of enough and perfection emanating from your heart like a
    golden light that blesses everything around you those old voices
    becoming a distant memory as the heart grows and smiles..  fills
    the room around you with its love and its knowledge you are a gift
    from heaven in this body on earth continuing to breathe fully into
    your heart allow the energy of your heart to spread to others who
    also recognize they are a gift from heaven in these bodies allow
    this glowing heart of love to expand beyond the city until it's
    covering the entire country blessing all that it touches around
    the world until this giant glowing essence of enough spiritual
    perfection is enveloping the entire earth entire planet.  Expand
    even larger allow this essence to reconnect with the sun who is
    absolutely enough.  It shines onto everyone every day blessing all
    parts of the earth as it turns..  The sun is absolutely enough.
    We see that every day.  Allow your light to shine as brightly as
    the sun, sharing your heart sharing your being knowing you are
    enough.  Simply resting in this knowledge resting in this fact of
    enoughness.  In a moment we'll begin to consolidate energy back
    into our bodies recognizing now we're containing the entire sun
    with our heart energy.  Begin to call your heart back into your
    physical body, offering your blessing to the sun as you begin to
    bring the heart toward your body.  Let your heart and the sun
    shine on each other from afar, continuing to bring your energy
    back into your physical body, wondering how it can possibly fit?
    Recognizing the magnitude of who you really are.  Continue to call
    in your energy until it's the size of the planet; keep breathing
    and call your energy into your body.  Let your heart become the
    size of the country, slowly breathing it in to be the size of the
    city, and gently gently as if a feather coming down to rest, your
    heart gently fully reconnects in your physical space as it
    naturally emanates about a meter outside your body.  Just welcome
    your heart back home, remembering what it felt like with your
    heart as large as the sun connecting across the solar system,
    Begin to reconnect with your mind.  Notice how the other messages
    pale compared to the brightness and the beautiful intensity of
    your heart, of your spiritual being.  All the should haves and
    could haves and didn't do's become meaningless.  and they all
    become good enough.  Recognize the enoughness of each one and
    bless it with your heart.  Recognizing the items on your to-do
    list, which ones truly deserve your attention?  and which ones are
    already good enough?  Allowing your heart to decide, your heart to
    know and share that information with you on the moment-to-moment
    basis as you move forward so you know clearly how a being with the
    heart the size of the solar system is already here already enough,
    and simply engages just as needed spontaneously as conditions
    arise remaining at peace remaining in stillness responding with
    love and grace as needed and no more.  until the entire life
    becomes like a play playing in joy as each and every event comes
    onto the screen and goes off the screen living in joy no matter
    what is on the screen recognizing that everything is perfect and
    we simply respond as needed in the moment the heart knows the way
    rests in the heart allowing it to guide the way in a moment we'll
    begin to reconnect with our shared space and in doing so remain
    connected with the heart space.  Recognizing your heart energy
    balanced, glowing, emanating from your body: always there always
    available.  Always reminding you you are enough.  Breathing into
    the blessings coming from your heart, just let them be a constant
    reminder of your enoughness.  As you're ready begin to open your
    eyes back into our shared space,

    Feel free to take a moment to jot down anything you noticed.
    
    It was beautiful allowing it to come through in real time.
    
    I look forward to listening to this recording next year and be
    like hey wow you know noticing the expansion that will have taken
    place by then.. "This staircase is a lot smaller than I remember
    it."
    
    So yeah, recognizing what you just said, this state of your
    expansion now *is* enough.  We are living in a 3D reality that
    includes a time component on the side or mixed within somehow.  So
    living in the 4D is part of the program.  So we're experiencing
    linear time as part of life part of the existence and While
    consciousness is free to move
    
    through time and through space, day-to-day living is in this time
    and this space.  Just allowing that to be enough, allowing the
    universe to open before you, as you move.  So yeah that's the
    blessing for today; the memory I want to leave with allowing this
    moment to be enough and bless yourself on the journey.  I bless
    you on your journey and look forward to continuing the journey as
    we go.  Yeah absolutely thank you.
