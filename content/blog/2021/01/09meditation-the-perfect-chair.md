take a moment to get yourself settled and
feeling your feet flat on the floor
and your body comfortably seated in your chair

just notice your breathing as it comes naturally
and imagine you're standing at a 
doorway that goes into a building

and when you open the door 
you see a staircase going down
and as you look inside you 
notice the air feels warm
and has a nice fragrance

it smells very inviting
and feels very calming

so you begin to walk into 
the staircase stepping down
each step

noticing the smooth curvature 
of the wall of the staircase
feeling the firm, clear, flat steps
gently leading you down deeper and 
deeper into a calm beautiful space

and as you move down, step by step
you notice a deeper feeling of peace 
coming into your body with each step

continuing to move down the stairs one by one
you notice the light becoming dimmer
and yet still clear enough 
you can see you are safe

until it's a nice smooth ambient light,
you're not sure where it's coming from.

Continuing to move down the stairs one by one
you notice your breathing has become
clear and smooth and soft as you feel 
completely comfortable in this space

after a while
you notice a little bit more 
light coming down from below

and as you continue curving
slowly down the steps you see the 
last step before it opens into a room
and step down the last five, four, 
third, second and the final step

step into this room
where the light is lighter and yet diffuse 
so you cannot see where it's coming from
looking around the room you 
see it's completely secure
completely safe

and you see a very comfortable chair
it looks like a beautiful ornate antique chair
that's been refurbished and made 
beautiful and waiting just for you

you love the colors; love the pattern
and you decide to have a seat
in what could only be your chair 
that's just perfect for you

you go up to the chair feel the surface
feel smooth and comfortable
soft and firm
just what you'd want in a chair

so you take a minute to look at the 
chair and just admire its ornate beauty
the fine craftsmanship that went into making this
chair

once you've admired the 
chair walking all the way around it  
feeling all of its surfaces

let 
yourself settle down into the chair
feeling how it completely and 
perfectly supports you your body

perfectly custom fit for you

the arms are at the exact right height

the seat is at the perfect height and softness

the back of the chair perfectly 
supports your back and your spine
and the head rest is amazing

just allows you to sink back fully supported
fully comforted by this perfect 
head rest on this perfect chair

you just enjoy sitting in this 
perfect chair designed for you

feel yourself perfectly supported and perfectly 
safe enjoying this beautiful room beautiful light
wonderful fragrance
with a deep quiet stillness

allow yourself to relax in 
this chair as long as you like

recognizing you feel more and more refreshed
more and more supported
and more and more calm
simply being in this space in this chair

once you feel completely refreshed
completely supported completely calm

you recognize it's time to begin moving again
so you begin to stand up

you feel yourself easily able to stand up from this perfect chair
you turn around thank the chair
for its safety, support, and comfort

and you notice very small circle on 
the side of the wall opposite the chair

walking over to it you recognize it's a button
and feeling safe and calm and 
secure you press the button
and the wall opens up and you 
recognize it's an elevator

you step inside the elevator and it indicates 
you're on the ground floor the very bottom
and there's one button to 
go back up to the surface

So you press that button
and the doors close gently and you're smoothly
quickly brought all the way back up to the surface
noticing the light getting brighter
and beautiful sunlight

As you step outside to enjoy the rest of your day feeling refreshed
feeling supported feeling calm happy that you found your perfect chair
that you can go back to anytime.

You begin to enjoy the rest of your day
