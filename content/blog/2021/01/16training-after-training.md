2021 is starting well, especially so if I allow my brain to chill out
and just flow with my heart.

I recently finished a short course on The Inspiration Process, which
helps clients get in touch with their real higher power.

I feel grateful to have received a beautiful email from one of my
fellow participants in the course:

This evening I attended Dive Into Darkness, a workshop about the
basics of emotions:

* Emotions are energy in motion
* Emotions rot if not dealt with
* no emotions are "bad"
* Emotions have messages for us

Plus several pair work exercises to allow deep exploration of our
emotions.

Dang, I could have led this workshop, except I didn't.

    The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose
    face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly;
    who errs, who comes short again and again.

    - Theodore Roosevelt

Why do I keep attending training after training instead of saying "hey
I can do this stuff!"

Part of the problem for me is knowing how to explain what I do.  "I
help people dive into their emotions and uncover the gold that's been
buried."  Yes, but it seems no one knows what that means.

"Take control of your life."  "Become the leader you were meant to
be."

Closer maybe, but too generic..   How do I find my language?

Hmm.  I will just keep walking the path; keep following my joy.

Thank you for reading my rant.

By the way, if you want to take control of your life, and become the
leader you were meant to be, [contact me](/contact/).  I can help with
that.  ;-)
