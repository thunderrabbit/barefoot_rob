Thanks to Andy for suggesting we visit Ikuta Ryokuchi Park; there are myriad hidden gems I had never previously seen!  He and Miku even showed us a shortcut from the station to the park, whereby we have a quieter walk and bypass a traffic signal.

After storing bags and wallets in free coin lockers at Taro Museum, we walked to the grassy hill behind the big protective sculpture.

So glad that everyone enjoyed themselves, including the rain!

After walking over a hill, we enjoyed the carpet-like grass near a rice field.

Thanks to a man walking by who took these photos of all of us.

On the way back, we saw several cats, including Jennie's Doppelganger:

From the top of a 3 story tower, which itself was on top of a hill, we noted some brown trees.
