I burst into tears while listening to Frederick narrate the forward of
his new book _Rites of Passage: Everyday Rituals of Healing And
Transformation_.

The passage was in the Foreword:

    ... if I share some of what I know, and do it in a good way,
    recognizing my teachers, calling out their names as I stand wobbly
    on their shoulders to sing to the horizon they have opened for me,
    I will fulfill some of what my own life has called me to do. Maybe
    it is incumbent on me. These are the things I have to teach.

His words spoke to a deeply known, carefully hidden part of myself,
afraid to teach what I know!

Let me offer here one thing I know.  Humans are part of the natural
world. Computers and email are in a different layer, removed from the
natural world by the concrete jungle.

When was the last time you physically contacted the earth?  Today?
This week?  This month?

If you are in concrete jungle called Tokyo, you can physically connect
with the natural world this coming Saturday August 14th for a [walking
meditation in Ikuta Ryokuchi
Park](https://www.robnugen.com/events/2021/08/14walking-meditation-enjoy-summer-in-ikuta-ryokuchi-park/).
(500 yen)

While writing this email, I went out into the rain to Lin's garden
plot.  It's summer but I felt comfortably cool, protected from sun by
the clouds.  The earth felt soft and welcomed my footprints.
Grasshoppers jumped away as I approached.  I could feel rain drops on
my back as I cut grass (with hedge shears).  Picking up handfuls of
cut grass, I felt smaller pieces adhere to my skin via rain.

With all my heart, I encourage you to go out and connect with the
natural world.  Take your shoes off and feel the grass as best you
can.  If there's no grass, be creative!  Hug a tree; caress leaves;
smell flowers.

If you actually do it, please write me back to let me know how it
went.  With your permission, the best replies will appear in my future
Tinyletter emails.

blessings always
<br>- Rob
