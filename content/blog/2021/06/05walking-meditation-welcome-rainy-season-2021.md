Max, Yuma, Hiro, Yuna, and Emico all joined me for the walk around
the park and we ended at 13:15 because we had to go around the
outer loop.

We walked quite slowly and stopped a couple of times to check
how people were doing and what people noticed so I think it
was a good balance of walking and checking.

Somehow I think there could be some more introduction or more
explanation but it also just didn't really come up so I didn't
worry about it.

I just went over a general safety piece and had people to take
care of themselves so it should be all good.

We got some pictures at the end and then Toko and Nithilim
joined us and walked with us toward Shibuya and we went to
the new Miyashita Park area for some food on the top floor
of the place.

Chilling inside everyone had a good time and Emico was able
to tell everyone about her workshop and then I put on my contacts
and walked over to Shibuya crossing and by the time I was getting set up
everyone had walked over there so I was really happy to see them.
