There's a parable of blind men touching an elephant and determining
that an elephant is different things based on what part of the
elephant they were feeling.

Similarly, we are all blindly experiencing life, each in a different
way, and thereby believing into reality a different world for each of
us.

Because we only experience the part of our world that we experience,
we tend to believe "this is everything" even though it's not even an
appreciable fraction of the whole.

Because our limited perception gives us an imperfect picture, we
similarly perceive apparent imperfections in ourselves.

This can cause us to judge ourselves as bad or incomplete because of
these (incorrect / incomplete) perceptions of imperfections.

Upon accepting (our incomplete perception of) ourselves, even though
we seem to think we are imperfect, we begin a process of loving
ourselves and loving what is.

Accepting all parts of ourselves as we are, we experience
unconditional love from within.  This allows the previously-considered
"imperfect" parts of us to be recognized as perfect within the world
in which we exist.

Recognizing all parts of ourselves to have value, we begin to allow
our parts to express their value in the world that we're
experiencing/creating with our perception.

The expression of ourselves doesn't have to be overt or even perceived
by others, but we can gain intrinsic value by allowing all parts of
ourselves to be involved in the experience of living in our world.

A recent overt example of this in my life was allowing the wacky idea
of walking across Japan to manifest itself in reality.

A recent private example of this in my life is judging my
mother-in-law as a burden in my life.  This judgement allows me to
realize that I have a judgey part of myself.  This judgy part of me
hangs out in my head and often accuses me of being imperfect.

Accepting that I have a judgey part of myself can allow me to love
that aspect of myself and give it a more useful role.
e.g. Recognizing the value of having a "part of me that can make
judgment" gives me the option of using said part to make quality
decisions in my life.

What parts of you might you have trouble accepting in your life?

How might your experience of life be different if you accept those
parts of you and love them for the value they bring into your life?
