Great day offering eye gazing in Shibuya today.

The big takeaway was that I didn't have to prepare too much or
go out of my way to be stressed about preparation. I just had
fun with preparation and did what made sense and did just the
right amount so I had everything I needed and didn't have too
much I mean it was very close to exactly what I needed during
the thing and I'm really glad about that.

I had eye gazing with all of my friends who were there and then
I lost count for a while but I ultimately came up with 11 people
who stopped to do eye casing with me while I was standing there.

There were probably about 11 other people who made eye contact
in passing but I didn't count those people because they didn't
stop and settle into the moment of eye contact with me.

At the end I met a man named Christian (sp) who told me he
does healing with his family in terms of prayer so he did a
prayer for me in Jesus's name and I thanked him and we talked
about religion a little bit.  I told him clearly that I recognize
each religion has some truth but no religion is *the* truth.
He kept listening so I went on to give the example of satanism
as a path toward God via self-service.


We also talked about how the current Corona and covid situation
has got people all hyped up and scared and fearful, which is
definitely not useful in terms of what I believe.  He said basically
the bible says "have no fear" and "trust in God" which is
exactly opposite of what most people are apparently doing.
