Great fun today in Manpukuji Park for our walking meditation.  
Y'all shoulda been there because we found wonderfully
cool water and fun squishy mud.. and forgot to take pics!

All cleaned up with a faucet afterward and Lin remembered to take a picture.

Join us next month in Ikuta Ryokuji Park near Mukogaokayuen Station.
