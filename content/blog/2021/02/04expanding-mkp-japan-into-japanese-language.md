Growing since Fall 2015, [Mankind Project
Japan](https://www.mkpjapan.org/) now has a weekly men's group on
Tuesday nights.  We have experienced significant growth since moving
to an online format since April 2020.

I believe the group now has enough men who speak Japanese (I count at
least 9) to staff a Japanese speaking open online group in a format
analogous to [MKP USA's Open Online Men's
Group](https://mkpusa.org/mens-group/).
