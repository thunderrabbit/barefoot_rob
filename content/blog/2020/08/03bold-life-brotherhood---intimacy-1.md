Tonight in our Bold Life Brotherhood meeting, we looked at ways to
improve our connection with loved ones on one of many possible
different ways of being intimate:

* physically
* sexually
* emotionally
* intellectually
* spiritually
* financially

Men in the circle chose bold actions to take in the next week,
deepening at least one component of intimacy in one important
relationship in their lives.
