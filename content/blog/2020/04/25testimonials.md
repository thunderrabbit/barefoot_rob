(under construction gif)

    There are some moments in life that are so hard to (live in) and
    navigate. Recently I have been through a fair share of those moments.

    The stress and confusion that those moments cause me stops / has been
    stopping me from taking action and from any attempts of problem
    solving. It may sound like a cliche, but the reality is that it makes
    me stuck.

    Rob's patience and attentive listening creates a safe space for me
    to open up and helped me to gain insight into the "tangled mess"
    of my feelings.

    Patiently guiding me through, peeling layer by layer, Rob helped me to
    focus on myself and my feelings, and to create more clarity about how
    the life stresses had affected me.

    Rob created a safe and open space where I could talk through some
    overwhelming feelings, which are difficult to talk about, or even to
    think about, in a daily life.

    I would recommend Rob to anyone who is willing to open up about their
    struggles, and who is open to receive gentle support to untangle
    emotional messes that are caused by living this thing called LIFE.
