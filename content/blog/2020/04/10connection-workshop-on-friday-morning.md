I enjoyed leading the first Connection Circle on a Friday morning, as
part of Oren's
[Quarantine Activity Guide for April 2020](https://mysideline.co/qag/2020-04/).
This was the fourth or so time I have led the workshop, and great to
see all new people in attendance.

The list below was my agenda, with the numbers being minutes on each
bit.  2 hours worked out quite well!

* 2	Ground rules
* 5	Grounding
* 15	Check in (name location feeling)
* 	
* 3	Time + mindfulness = joy
* 	
* 20	Three rounds of gratitude
* 15	How have you spent your time recently?
* 	
* 5	break (get writing utensils)
* 	
* 25	Healing the past visualization (while connected to the present)
* 15	If anything, what might you want to change about how you spend your time?
* 10	(optional) What new opportunities have you noticed?
* 10	Set SMART Stretch for self

Next circle will be 9:30am - 11:30am Tokyo time Friday April 17th.
Enjoy deep connection with like minded people in the safe setting of
your own home!  [must RSVP to join](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJ0vd-ivrjsuFBPC88GR2Te9ythO_bGy6g)!
