I have heard in TLBS many times: *no one is paying attention.*

From September 10th to October 10th, I diligently posted daily (*)
videos on FB in which we connect to our heart focus on a daily basis.

<div class="note">(*) all but one of those days.</div>

Today one of my friends said "I saw you posted videos on Facebook. What were they about?"

Haha fair enough!
