We apparently live in two worlds.

With our physical bodies we
experience the temporal 3D world around us, featuring sights, sounds,
gravity, magnetism, ice cream, etcetera.

With our consciousness we experience a lot of things, all of which are
within and part of a Silence (*), an is-ness that exists beyond time and
space.

As humans, we experience both at the same time, sometimes focusing on
one more than the other.  Go to work and focus on the material world.
Go to church and focus on the spiritual world.

    God isn't stuck inside the church.

I don't recommend religions that say "you'll go to hell if you don't
believe what we tell you to believe."  They're just trying to scare
you into listening to them instead of listening to God within
yourself.

    God dwells in you as you.

*Doesn't that mean I am God?*

In a word, yes, and in a way, no, because part of the game in
incarnating in these 3D monkey suits is to forget that we are God, to
limit our powers to what we can do with our bodies, which includes our
ability to communicate with others in the same game.

And yet, within the game, there is no reason we cannot discover the
ruse.  We are both mortals in monkey suits *and* part of the infinite
Silence.

And then go a level deeper and remember that God has no desires.  God
is the Silence and is simply awareness.

There is only one rule in the universal game: attraction.

When we speak within the silence, our words have power.  We are all
magicians in that way.  "Please God I need some money."  God answers,
"yes, you need some money."

(*) We ought not call it "God" due to the myriad ideas that
have been placed on that word, but I will use the word "God" as a
shorthand and so I can shake a few trees.


With lists of things to do and places to be, people to meet and
meetings to attend, how can we keep sane?  Meditate all day, sitting
in silence, noticing thoughts pass by like clouds?

Why not both?

Mindfully moving in Silence, noticing thoughts and experiences as well
as your body's reactions as you move through the day.

We are eternal spirits living inside temporary 3D bodies.

In order to make the experience of life on earth more exciting, we
forget we are infinite spirits.  In the process of remembering, we may
come to think the 3D form is somehow less important
