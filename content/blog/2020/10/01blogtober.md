Now I am going to make it `draft: false` as I am now starting
Blogtober, inspired by Col on Thought Leaders Business School.

He talked about making decisions, and suggested some topics about
which we *could* possibly make decisions:

**What's a decision you could make around**

* information diet
* work environment
* smart phone use
* list building
* societal contributions
* personal brand
* approaches and meetings
* friends and family
* intellectual property development
* environmental impact
* self care

He talked about decisions as being the nexus between Conundrum and
Action.

Looking over our lists of possible decisions points, we found some we
could merge so that one decision could be made that positively
affected two different topics.

For me, I found three I could merge:

* work environment + personal brand => clean my room
* societal contribution + environmental impact => walk more
* idle click games + ip development => more pink sheets

So with the first one in mind, I am going to offer some of my books to
people and others on FB to whoever might want them.
