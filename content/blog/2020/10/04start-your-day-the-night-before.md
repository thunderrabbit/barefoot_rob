Do you wake up groggy, checking your incoming mail and messages to get
your day started?

My coach reminded me of this some months ago, and it has helped me
have more productive and happier days.

Take a mindful moment in the evening, quietly reviewing the day and
going over the plan vs the reality of the day.  What went well?  What
could be done differently?

Recognizing these insights, look at your schedule for tomorrow and
make a plan tonight for how you will move about your day.

By quietly listening to wisdom and intuition while planning my day the
night before, I wake up the next morning excited to begin my day!

How do you wake up each morning?
