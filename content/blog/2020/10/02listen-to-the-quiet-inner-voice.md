Do you ever find yourself wishing you had followed your intuition?

Last night I was up too late trying to "get things done", many of
which seemed important at the time.

As I headed to bed, I had a little tug in my mind to get my daily
planner that I hadn't filled in for a day or so.

"I'm too tired.. I'll do it tomorrow," I replied to that quiet voice
to quiet it down even further.

I fell into bed and slept like a log.  This morning, I woke up
bleary-eyed at 6:10 and then suddenly _"Ahh today is Friday!  I have a
call in 20 minutes!  Ahhhh!  I have to do my morning livestream now!"_

All of this morning's panic could have been smooth sailing had I
listened to that little voice last night.  *Spend some quiet moments
to mindfully plan your day.*  Prepare yourself for success!
