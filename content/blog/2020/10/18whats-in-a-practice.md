In order to simplify things, I am playing with the idea of my practice
being what I practice.  I walk barefoot everywhere.

How can this be a practice?  Walking barefoot is a way to get in touch
with your body.  It's a way to wake up some nerve endings that may not
get much stimulus.  Now that they are awake, it's chance to pay
attention to this moment.

"すごいいい！"　　"It feels good!"

These responses are especially common on beautifully manicured grass,
and part of the reason I like to have walking meditation in Shinjuku
Gyoen.  Another reason is that the energy there feels super calm and relaxing.

All my sessions are about getting in touch with yourself and what is
true for you.  Whether through meditation, breathing, earthing, all
roads lead to home in yourself.

Join us in Shinjuku Gyoen this coming Saturday October 24th!

Refresh your spirit. Touch the earth. Connect with nature.
