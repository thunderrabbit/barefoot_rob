I am sitting on the train with hot tears drying on my face.  Feeling
relaxed after a good cry on the way to the station.  Riding my bicycle
along the same route that I walked with Ma and Madeleine multiple
times while they were here brought the emotions forward.

Sadness is the emotion of loss.  I need time to grieve the loss of
having my mom here with me.  Now I'll have her on Skype but no hugs or
carrying bags or overhearing her and Madeleine sharing notes and
photos about their day.

After allowing myself a wet sniffly slobbery cry, I feel super chill
and strangely warm even though it's cold.  Maybe it's my new jacket
that Ma gave me from the back of Jon's closet.  But definitely feeling
relaxed after a nice cry.  I don't have to hold all those emotions in.

Tomorrow will be a new day as I head back to work, but for today just
cry and cry like no one's looking.

I hope you can allow yourself to cry if you need to.

On this same subject I had a great cry in my men's group today.  Tears
gushing, sobbing, deep gasping breaths.  Gratitude for the men
supporting me.
