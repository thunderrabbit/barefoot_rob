### New Year + New Decade, leading 24 workshops in 2020

My goal for 2020 is to lead at least 24 workshops.   Two per month should be doable, right?

I currently have 4 different workshops available.  Three are very clearly in the same genre, though they may not seem that way from the outside.

1. Barefoot Walkshops.  This is where it all started, when my student
   Yuna took off her shoes during our walk before my first eye gazing
   workshop.  The idea is simple: take off your shoes and walk around
   outside!  This allows the nerves in the feet to get some much
   needed stimuli, especially if they have been cooped up in shoes all
   the time!

2. Eye Gazing.  Perhaps *this* is where it all started, when my
   friend, life coach Rin, asked me what workshop would be most
   exciting for me to lead.  It took a while to come up with the
   answer, but when it came, it was like BINGO this is it!  The idea
   is simple: sit with a partner and look into their eyes.  Just
   breathe.  No need to say something witty.  Just be present with
   what comes up for you.

3. Shadow Work® practice.  In October 2019, I took the 8 day Basic
   Facilitator Training for Shadow Work® in Sugar Land, Texas.  From
   their website, https://shadowwork.com/
 
    Shadow Work® is a way of transforming parts of your character that
    you’d like to change with compassion and understanding, and offers
    an effective technology for balancing these diverse parts.

Along with facilitator Mark Wild, I led one Shadow Work® practice
workshop in December 2019, and plan to do more.
 
The above three workshops are all designed to bring awareness to the
participants.  Physical awareness of the body starting with the feet,
mental and emotional awareness through the eyes, and inner awareness
of our inner voices.

4. Past Life Memories workshops allow participants to experience a
   grander world that they may find familiar.  I lead participants on
   a guided meditation which reconnects them to a familiar place.  I
   keep the wording loose enough to have exploration, and clear enough
   to provide guidance.  Participants have a chance to reflect and
   write about what they noticed during the meditations.

Coming up in January, I plan to lead a barefoot walkshop on January
11th, and a past life memories workshop on January 13th.  I will
likely lead a coffee and chat workshop with Yuna on January 25th.  In
February, I have planned an eye gazing workshop for February 23rd.

Currently I am using Facebook and Meetup for my events:

* https://www.facebook.com/barefootrob/events
* https://www.meetup.com/Tokyo-S%C5%8Dl-barefoot-more/events/

Also planned for, let's say, the first quarter of 2020: a more
comprehensive website, featuring a schedule of events!
https://www.robnugen.com/ currently has my blog and my journal.  I
want to add pages for Schedule, Contact, About, and maybe other pages.

   Love and Light
    - Rob!
