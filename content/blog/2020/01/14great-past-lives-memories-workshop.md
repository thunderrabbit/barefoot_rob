This officially counts as my second of 24+ workshops this year.  Past
Lives Memories was a great success!  Three people attended, and it is
the first time I actually turned a profit on a workshop.  (Previously I
have lost money on room or materials or both.)

The workshop went really well and I got good feedback from the
participants.  Special thanks to everyone for attending!
