Ma, Madeleine, and I enjoyed a great day walking through the old
Japanese houses, speaking with some of the volunteer guides as we
enjoyed spectacularly clear blue skies and crisp fresh air.  It's a
natural haven just 30 minutes from Shinjuku, the busiest train station
in the world.

Pics coming soon I hope!
