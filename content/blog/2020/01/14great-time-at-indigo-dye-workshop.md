Ma, Madeleine, and I enjoyed a great day walking through the old
Japanese houses, speaking with some of the volunteer guides as we
enjoyed spectacularly clear blue skies and crisp fresh air.  It's a
natural haven just 30 minutes from Shinjuku, the busiest train station
in the world.

Great to see the New Year's decorations and we received some hand-made
souvenirs: grasshoppers made of grass, and mice made of paper!

The indigo dye workshop was *amazing* fun.  I told the staff I'd come back
hundreds of times.  It was a bit of a challenge to understand the
Japanese, but we had a great time dyeing and created some beautiful handkerchiefs!
