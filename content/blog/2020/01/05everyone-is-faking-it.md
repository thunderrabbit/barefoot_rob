Ever feel like you don't know how to do something?  Or feel like
everyone else knows what they are doing?  I feel like that sometimes,
and I have a secret to share.  Everyone feels that way sometimes.

I was just listening to stories told by my mom and her sister.  They
told us stuff I never knew about their parents, my grandparents,
"Granddad and Monner"

In particular how strict Granddad was.  He apparently told Madeleiene
"once I figured out how to be a father, you all had grown up."

Granddad was great for me and my brother, but he didn't have
everything figured out when he was raising his kids.

Just do your best, take time for yourself when you can, and that's
enough.
