One of my main concerns when advertising has been to not annoy people.  Part of me says I should not mention the events I post because advertising is annoying.  If I annoy people, they will leave me and I will be alone.
Likewise, if someone says they will attend a workshop, I don't want to bug them with a reminder.

How do you see event promotion and repeated reminders?  How often is optimal?

Great experiences in the past week-ish:

1. Jan 10th: I canceled a day of computering and went to a local park and tie-dye studio where they do indigo dyeing.  The studio had just closed for the day, but I met Chiaki and Ryosuke who were friendly and funny.  We went to a nearby art museum together!

2. Jan 11th: After enjoying walking barefoot with Masa, Mark, and
Shinobu, we drank tea in a cute cafe called Butter.

3. Shinobu and I are planning a monthly show and tell for artists in an intimate setting.  She came up with a great name:

Your Art Matters

The first event will be on February 8th.  https://www.meetup.com/Tokyo-Sol-barefoot-more/events/267844657/

4. Jan 13th: Ma and Madeleine joined me at the Folkhouse museum near
Mukogaoka Yuen.

Ma and I enjoyed tie-dyeing handkerchiefs at the indigo dyeing studio.
I told the guides/instructors I would come back many hundreds of
times.

We visited the nearby art museum as well.

5. Jan 13th: Great Past Lives Memories workshop with three participants.

6. Jan 25th: Yuna and I will be hosting a coffee + chat meetup on January 25th.  Already 4 people have said they will attend!   https://www.meetup.com/English-coffee-more/events/267921145/

In other news, for the past few days, my productive streak seems to have waned; I have not been doing my morning routine to start the day.  I felt shame and sadness at my inability to speak Japanese well enough at a meeting on Saturday.

Fortunately, I got to reset my brain and emotional state yesterday at SOGO's weekly workout in Yoyogi, then reconnected with Lin on Sunday afternoon.

How do you reset your brain?  Email me at rob **Œ±ùê≠** robnugen.com or [send a comment](https://www.robnugen.com/contact/)

Thank you for your love and support.

    Rob!
