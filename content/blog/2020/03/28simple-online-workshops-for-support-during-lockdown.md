Japan has finally started its lockdown related to COVID-19.  Let's use
this opportunity to connect with each other in a meaningful way.

First, connect with your family and those who you live with.  Have
those conversations you've been meaning to have.  Express your love
and appreciation.

If there's no love or appreciation, or no one with you, use the
internet for connection.  Here is a simple outline of an online
workshop that worked well via Zoom.  We did it with about 6 people
each time.  Zoom breakout rooms with 2 or 3 people per room gave time
for deeper connection.

* grounding (e.g. [Simple grounding, breathing energy up from earth](https://soundcloud.com/thunderrabbit/simple-grounding-breathing-energy-up-from-earth))
* ground rules (e.g. the [agreements we use for MKP Japan](https://www.mkpjapan.org/agreements/))
* check-in (how are you feeling now?)
* round and round and round with gratitude: "What are you grateful for?"
* (in breakout rooms) what is best case, bad case, worst case scenario for you
  personally, + what will you do if worst case happens?
* round and round and round answering the question Who else are you?
  As things change, who else are you?  what other talents do you have
  to offer?
* check out (how are you feeling now?)
