I just had a call with Robert Golden.  I went from angry and helpless about the virus to enjoying a new fun adventure.

Tonight I am leading a new fun adventure online workshop.  Men and women welcome; it's a fun new adventure!

    you doing to take care of yourself and loved ones during this time?
