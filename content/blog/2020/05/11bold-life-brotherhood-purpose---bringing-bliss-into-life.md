Great circle tonight with 8 men in attendance (including myself).  We
created stretches toward bringing blissful purpose into our lives.

**Exercise:**

Write down all the things that light you up.

* What is your #1 thing that lights you up?
* What bold action can you take to bring more of this into your life?
