    "Living a life takes longer than reading a biography."
    - Rob Nugen
​

Welcome to May!

My timeline of workshops has certainly accelerated with the new
schedule offered by the Covid Powered Pause.  My goal was to lead
<del>24</del> 36 workshops in 2020, easily achievable at 3 per month:

* First Saturdays: barefoot walkshop
* Third Saturdays: Your Art Matters (co-lead with Shinobu)
* ???? : eye gazing or past life memories

*Now*, as of May, nine+ per month!

* Every Monday: Bold Life Brotherhood
* Every Friday: Life Changing Life Adventures
  (co-lead with Rin)
* mid-month: Your Art Matters (co-lead with Shinobu)


I used the quote at the top to remind myself: even as things seem to
be accelerated, day to day things seem to be slow, and "normal".  I
still eat too much, waste time mindlessly online, haven't been walking
each day, don't meditate or even study Japanese each day.  And *that's
okay*.

I am distracted by N+1 things even as I write this newsletter, which
(in early April) I hoped to write by May 5th so I could include the
pun "Go Go!"

On April 30th, I enjoyed having a chance to safely release some anger
in my men's circle.  In the process, I dented my wooden desk.

Afterward, I wrote in ink around the dent, "My body and I fucking
matter!" and "GO OUTSIDE!!" to act as both an affirmation and a
reminder to take care of myself.  I need not be cooped up in my room
all the time.

And so, to the point, if I can find my way forward, I think you can
too.  Just keep being as mindful as you can, as courageous as you
like, and take care of yourself first before others.

Love and Light

ps: I am pretty sure this newsletter is way shorter than the previous
ones and I am having some anxiety about that but I'm gonna send it
anyway.
