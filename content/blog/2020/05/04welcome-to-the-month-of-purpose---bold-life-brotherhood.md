So proud to be part of five men embarking on this bold journey into
Purpose.  I tapped in to an old dream I have had on the back burner
for two years, to walk barefoot to 新潟, way on the other side of this
island, 68 hours away by foot!

After inner reflection to find our current Purpose in life, we looked
at the inner and outer challenges and then all set stretch goals to do
in the next week.

Great depth tonight.  Thank you men!
