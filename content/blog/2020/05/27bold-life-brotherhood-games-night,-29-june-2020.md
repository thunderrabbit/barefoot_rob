Men

On the 5th Monday of June, I would like to do a special fun chill out
event with you guys, just to get to know each other better and have a
good time.

I propose we jump onto our same Zoom room and play boardgames on
https://boardgamearena.com/

In order for this to work, each man should make an account on
https://boardgamearena.com/   My username on the site is thunderrabbit
