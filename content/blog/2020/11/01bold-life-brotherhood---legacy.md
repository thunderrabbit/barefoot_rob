The question isn’t whether or not we’re creating a legacy.

The question is whether or not we’re actively and consciously creating the legacy that we want.

In order to create a powerful legacy with your life, you need to decide what contribution you want to make to the world.

What legacy do you want to leave with your life?

Join us in [Bold Life Brotherhood](/bold-life-brotherhood/) to create
your legacy.
