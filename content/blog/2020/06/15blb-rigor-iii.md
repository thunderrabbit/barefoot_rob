Great meeting tonight with a new man in the circle.  We rewrote some
of the messages from our inner critics and even sent the inner critics
packing!  Great rewrites such as

"you can't do it" ---> "It's already done!"

"you don't know what to do" ---> "I trust my creativity"

What are some ways you'd rewrite messages from your inner critic?
