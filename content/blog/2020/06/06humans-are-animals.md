Where are your shoes?

(I'll come back to that question in a bit.)

When I was growing up in the US (Texas), I was told that as an
American, I can do or be or say whatever I want.

I was told I was great, smart, lovable, etc.

Do you carrot all for me?

I sure hope not.

That was in 3rd grade.  8 years old, so it has stuck with me for 42
years and I use that memory to tell you all Yes. I care for you.  I
care.  I love.  And I feel helpless to do anything so I breathe and
create space for people to be honest and open and vulnerable.

Last night I heard a lecture about bonobo apes, a society of near
humans that spend 3 to 4 hours per day working and the rest of the
time chilling, playing, sexing, and at night getting plenty of sleep.

Hearing this reminded me of how disconnected I am from the natural
world.  I've got all this fancy plastic, wires, and radio waves around
me keeping me from directly interfacing with the natural world.  I
sometimes hide away in my room, thinking I am making a difference
(more work, more Zoom calls, more talking), while not noticing I am
pissing off my physical ape body.

Here's my ultimate conspiracy theory: humans started communicating
with language so bad aliens came down pretending to be God and said
"do what I say or you will go to hell"  .. wait I had it


And now, furthering my vulnerability, I am going to go out on a limb
and augment my stance on going barefoot everywhere.


* By comparing my pain to your pain, by saying I should be happy
  because you have a worse experience than me, I dismiss my pain,
  which ends up projected to dismiss your pain.  By acknowledging my
  pain, getting through it, I model getting through pain and can offer
  support in getting through pain.


Possible elevator pitches:

We've lost connection with ourselves and take it out on other people.

By connecting more with the natural world, we can be more in alignment with our true nature.

"Modern" Humans think they are the smartest animal and have made themselves the weakest.  instead of accepting our weakness and embracing the natural world, we hide our weakness by pushing away the natural world.




“We get together on the basis of our similarities; we grow on the basis of our differences.”

— Virginia Satir


Be accountable
Be honest and communicate
Be vulnerable

Humble spirit bold action

"If you say this, you must mean this, .. "   how about you ask me what
I mean.  Words means different things to different people.  How to go
beyond the words.  If you and I have different definitions, let's talk
about that.  "I am scared, I don't want to talk to you."

My truth vs the truth vs your truth

Ask, don't assume.

when we are isolated, it leads to more trouble.

The child who is not embraced by the village will burn it down to feel
the warmth

be a part of the village to feel warm or burn the village to feel warm

dehumanizing other humans
