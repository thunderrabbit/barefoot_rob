Today Shu and Hiro joined Shinobu and I for our fifth(?) Your Art
Matters event!

Hiro showed his HO gauge model train track he has been working on
since 2001.  Shu showed her drawings that she has been doing daily in
the last month.  Shinobu showed her interior landscape images.  I
showed my start at soldering stainless steel wire for a new marble
track.

And someone didn't take a single photo!

Here is my custom made soldering iron stand, made out of a single
piece of wire.
