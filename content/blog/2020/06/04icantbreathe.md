For tens of years I have intentionally ignored news because it just
ends up riling me up and making me feel scared and sometimes angry.  I
always went with the phrase, "if it gets bad enough, they'll come tell
me."

I saw a post the other day about how I don't know what black people
have gone through or are going through now.  That's certainly true.

Humans can have empathy for each other, but until we have lived
through the same experiences, it's hard to know what it's really like.
   
What is it like to be suffocated to death with a knee in the back of
the neck?  I don't know, but I imagine it is pretty fucking horrible.

And even without watching any of the videos, I dare say the officer
should have known that he was doing something pretty fucking horrible.

How the fuck did this happen?

In my men's circles, I often invite men to breathe. "Become aware of
your breathing in this moment.  Allow your body to breathe itself as
you imagine pure clean energy coming up from the earth and filling
your body."

This works well in many situations.

* Feeling anger? breathe.  Transmute the anger into action.
* Feeling joy? breathe.  Experience this moment to its fullest.
* Feeling fear?  breathe.  Allow your brain some oxygen and space to figure out what to do next. 
* Etc.

Try breathing.  Breathing works wonders.

...

George Floyd was denied the right to breathe.

Wait, what?

George Floyd was denied the right to breathe!!!

I said

**GEORGE FLOYD WAS DENIED THE RIGHT TO BREATHE!!**

I have seen #icantbreathe hashtags so just like "don't taze me bro" I
guess George Floyd was saying "I can't breathe" to the people around
him...  People. around him.  Humans, who I believe can have empathy.

A knee intentionally crushing someone's windpipe into the ground is
pretty much the opposite of human empathy.  It's horrifying to imagine
"I can't breathe" were George Floyd's last words on earth.

So what to do?

Breathe.  Give your brain and body oxygen to transmute your feelings
into awareness and knowledge of what's next.

After you breathe, let your new awareness move you courageously
forward into action.

Use your empathy to stand up for human rights in whatever ways suit
your situation.

Write.  Call.  Join.  Leave.  Invite.  Ask.  Speak.  Share.  Meditate.
Pray. Post.  Breathe.  We are all connected and all playing a part.

Black Lives Matter.
