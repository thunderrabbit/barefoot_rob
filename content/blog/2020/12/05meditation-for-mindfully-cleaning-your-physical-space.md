<p class="narration">Take a moment to get connected to your body. Feeling present in your
physical space, noticing the things around you, their support of you.
</p>

<p class="narration">Looking around in your physical space. Notice one item that speaks to
you.  Allow your eyes to alight on it gently and easily.
</p>

<p class="narration">Feel free to move toward it or connect with this item. You may feel it
with your hands, or simply notice it with your eyes. Feel what comes
up for you. As you notice this item.
</p>

<p class="narration">Notice memories that may come up. Notice how it feels for you now
thinking of this item in your future.
</p>

<p class="narration">Thank this item for having been in your life, placing it where it
needs to go. Maybe back where it was, or to a new place.
</p>

<p class="narration">Now sitting and breathing. Notice how you feel after having connected
with this item.
</p>

<p class="narration">And after having decided a new home for it. When you're ready, we'll
move on to the next item.
</p>

<p class="narration">Breathe fully into your body and allow your eyes to gently move around
the space, until they alight on some item in the space around
you. Notice this item with your eyes. Notice it with your heart. You
may touch it physically, or just be present with it in a way that
serves you.
</p>

<p class="narration">Notice what memories come up as you connect with this item. Notice
what feelings come up as you are present with it. Let your heart
recognize the optimal future for this item with regard to your
life. You may choose to release it. Place it in a new area, or leave
it in its current place.  Thanking the item for its service in your
life. If you release the item blessing it on its future path.
</p>

<p class="narration">If you choose to keep the item, thanking it for its blessing you on
your path. Take a moment to re-center yourself after acknowledging
this item.
</p>

<p class="narration">Finding your authentic self. Breathing in your body, allowing yourself
to look around the room again. Let your eyes, alight on another item
in the room. Moving to that item, you may simply notice it with your
eyes, or hold it, and connect with it physically. Notice how it feels
seeing this item. Perhaps holding this item, recognizing your history,
and how it has served you. Choosing now, how it can best serve you in
the future. And where it's home will be going forward. You can choose
if it will be part of your life. You can choose if it will be released
to a new life of its own.
</p>

<p class="narration">Make that choice now, feeling confident with your
decision. re-centering yourself in your body. Breathing, noticing your
breath. Once you feel centered allow your eyes to notice the next
thing in your room,
</p>

<p class="narration">Moving toward that item, notice the feelings that come up for you, as
you see it and as you hold it. Maybe bringing your other senses. How
does it smell? What's the texture? Really acknowledging this item and
its role in your life.
</p>

<p class="narration">Notice how it feels to see this item now. Noticing your opportunity to
choose the future home for this item, whether it be a new life for
this item to live on its own, or a shared experience with your own
life, and this item continuing to be in your space. Noticing the
feelings that come up, noticing the memories that come. Allow yourself
to make a clear choice as to how to process this item and moving on
with the process. Once you're complete, allow yourself to get
re-centered. Breathing fully into your body,
</p>
