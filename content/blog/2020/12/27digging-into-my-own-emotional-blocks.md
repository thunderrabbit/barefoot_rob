A couple months ago, I started attending [Dmitri Bilgere](https://www.dmitrib.com/)'s course The Inspiration
Process.


A few days ago I got to be the model being processed. Even though I
"know" the steps of the process from taking the course, I had some
great insights and felt inspired after completing the work.  Coming
out the other side, I had great realization of who I am and who I want
to be in my life. This recording shows how effective The Inspiration
Process can be. I hope you enjoy it.  I certainly did!
