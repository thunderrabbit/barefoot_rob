The body uses oxygen and burns food to give it energy. These are all natural processes. The body knows how to take care of itself. So the body exists in time. And for this exercise, we will allow ourselves to let go of the body. Knowing it will be here when we are finished as the body has a future So, just thank your body for a moment and allow it to take care of itself. We will be right back with the body noticing what remains you might notice mental thoughts and ideas. These often have a time component based in memories and repetition.
