In our Weekly Alignment last night, we practiced listening to our Self, as opposed to our
chattering monkey mind.

    Take a moment to breathe, just releasing any tension in your body,
    nice deep breath and just let it out, let you know the tension
    drop off of your shoulders, allowing your body to breathe
    itself. Welcome brother, checking in with your body in this
    present moment, similar to the being present. Without future or
    past. How did that go for you during the week. Yeah. Sounds like a
    new adventure in a way like starting the clearing process. So you
    can begin the year a new. Very nice. for the program
    today. Listening to the mind chatter. And being able to
    distinguish chatter that's coming directly from mind and ego
    versus information, which could be words could be sensations could
    be feelings that are coming from a higher place a spiritual
    source, as it were, that has our best interests in mind, and a
    grander viewpoint than what we have been here in the middle of
    life on the planet, and within this time dimension in three
    dimensions of space. How do you distinguish between mind chatter,
    and inspiration, coming from spirit. Like in your mind receiving
    inspiration from spirit or higher self versus the background mind
    chatter of this more basic within the 3d realm as opposed to
    having this higher perspective. So we're going to explore that
    tonight. Practicing distinguishing between mind chatter, and
    insight from the, from a higher source in higher space. So, just
    taking a moment. If you want to have a notebook ready, this is a
    good time to prepare that good teen present in your body. Allow
    yourself to tune in to that ceiling that you described associated
    with information coming from the higher self. The
    excitement. Allow yourself to tune in. Very simply being
    connected. Simply and clearly to this feeling may feel like
    love. You may feel warm. He may feel excitement, just tuning in to
    this sensation, recognizing that this connection is always
    available at any given moment, with the intention of connecting to
    your highest self. Use your mind or your voice with your intention
    to connect only to your highest self in your best
    interest. connected to your purpose in life. In this
    moment. Welcoming your connection. Clearly and simply allow
    yourself to have a bit of a dialog. Very simple. With the answers
    coming, even as soon as you can pose the question, how do you
    connect most clearly with your higher self. What type of
    questions. Can you ask of your hire So when is your higher self
    available for you. Well now we, the answers to come very clearly
    and simply write down any answers that you hear, as it best serves
    you. recognizing this connection in a very clear way, asking your
    higher self how to distinguish between the higher self insights
    and other ramblings of the mind. Feeling that love warm open
    connection. Thank your higher self, your own cell for creating the
    connection. And we'll practice, keeping the connection open while
    speaking with each other in keeping the connection open while
    writing in your notebook. Take a moment to write in your notebook
    any insights you received. Welcome to share with me as you
    wish. For me, my higher self always uses positive language. So,
    for me if I hear something like, do not do this. That's for me
    that's not from my higher self, the phrasing is always
    positive. Loving patient calm. These are words that I've used to
    describe my, the sensations I get connected to higher so while I
    was leading the meditation, I. It was my intention to just bring
    it all down from from higher self so I don't remember all the
    questions that I asked in that meditation, but I think there's at
    least one or two more that were there. Did you notice any other
    insights that came during the meditation. The mind is well versed
    and offering things to think about. So, allowing awareness, step
    back from the mind while it's busy chattering. Okay. Gavin Watson
    notice that the mind is there, busily trying to keep control,
    maybe a way to describe it. So yeah. The next thing I had planned
    is very related to that and related related to last week, or maybe
    two weeks ago, where we allowed the mind chatter to go down down
    down into the worst possible scenario. And having done that
    exercise already. Last week, we don't need to do the exercise,
    again, but just notice what it felt like doing that, you can do a
    very abbreviated version of that exercise, what might happen, and
    noticing the downsides. But more importantly, noticing how it
    feels when these types of thoughts are coming up for you. Notice
    if there is a difference in your posture. Notice the difference in
    your energy in your body. Is there a difference in the tension. Is
    there a difference in how quickly your mind is moving. Simply
    notice how it feels. For the mind to take over and go down the
    rabbit hole. And now practice, releasing the mind coming back up,
    as it were, into the feeling connected to your higher
    self. Welcome in your focus your hero awareness back into your
    higher self. Notice the difference in the texture of the
    feeling. Notice the posture of your body. Notice the speed with
    which your mind is moving. Notice the space between your
    consciousness, and your mind. As your consciousness is more fully
    present and aware with your higher self. And just as practice is
    an exercise. Allow your consciousness to move back to your
    mind. Connecting to one of the thoughts. Connecting to one of the
    thoughts and just allow your consciousness to lock on to the
    thought noticing how it feels. As your consciousness is locked
    into a thought. Is there a difference this time. After being
    connected to your higher self versus a previous time where maybe
    you've been lost in thoughts all day. One type of indication, can
    you notice that to become lost in thought. How can you remind
    yourself to reconnect to your higher self. From inside this
    state. Practice noticing yourself lost in thought, and use that to
    bring yourself back into awareness of your higher self. No to
    seeing your body, noticing your breathing reconnecting to the
    space. The silence, in which your higher self rests. Notice this
    way of noticing. When you've become lost in thought. So you can
    more easily recognize in your day to day activities. Maybe setting
    an intention for yourself. To quickly notice when you've become
    lost in thought, allowing yourself to keep connection to your
    higher self consciously. This will be our playful exercise, size,
    during the week. Practicing staying connected to higher
    self. Recognizing it's a process. The higher self is slowly
    welcoming and accepting giving yourself time to practice this new
    way of being. Thank you for practicing with me now.
