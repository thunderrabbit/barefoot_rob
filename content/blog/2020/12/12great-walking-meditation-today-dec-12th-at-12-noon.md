So happy Akiko, Cyabo, and Yui joined Amaru and I in the walking
meditation workshop today.  Amaru has joined three times, and for
Akiko, Cyabo, and Yui, it was their first time each.

Entering the park, we walked slowly under the beautifully yellow, orange, red, crimson leaves on trees near the
新宿門 entrance.  Walking meditatively toward the spot we used the
past two times I have done walking meditation, we took in the colors
and took some pictures.

I pointed out the nice soft grass and guided them to carefully try the
rough surfaces of the asphalt sidewalks, including grates and round
plates (manhole covers).

We did some freestyle meditative walking around the green tarp which
held our stuff, and I tried crawling on the ground to get more contact
with grass and earth.  Amazingly, I found a bee(?) that was in its
final stages of life, and held it in my hand for a while.  Foolishly,
I did not take a picture of it.  Somehow I thought that would be
irreverent, and now I wish I had the pic for my journal.

We ended up sitting in a group and I led some breathing meditation
while feeling connected with the body and earth.

The wind started picking up a bit so we left our space around 1:30pm.
Amaru headed home and I walked through the greenhouse with Akiko,
Cyabu, and Yui.
