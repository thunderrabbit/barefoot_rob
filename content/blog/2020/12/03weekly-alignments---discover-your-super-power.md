Starting with our Deepest Desire from last week, we explored our
innate abilities (our super powers) and how they can be used to help
heal ourselves:

    Take a moment and get present in your space.  We'll do just a few
    grounding piece, to reconnect with your purpose and inner
    strength.

    Settling into your seat. Just notice your breathing. Just take
    some nice, deep breaths. Fully inflating your lungs and body just
    let it out.

    Breathing in again, fully inflating your lungs and your whole
    body. Just let it out.

    One more time. Imagine breathing all the way in to all parts of
    your body.  Hold it, and...  just let it all back out.

    Let your breathing come back to its own natural pace, dropping all
    of the tension. All the thoughts and ideas from today.

    Just allow them to shrug off your shoulders and drop down to the
    ground, to be grounded by Mother Earth.


    Recognizing within yourself, this desire to have protection. This
    desire to have purpose. This desire to live fulfilled life -
	is coming from within you.

    A deep part of you is calling to remind you of your true self.

    Recognizing that self is here, perhaps buried under fears and
    ideas and thoughts about what must happen first. Just allow those
    to drop away. Imagine settling in to your true self.

    Settling into your inner strength, settling into your inner purpose.

    Just notice what it's like having this energy, knowing it's
    here...  not having to know when or how we'll use it.  Just
    breathing into the truth of yourself, here.

    Your full potential is present, allowing you to move into action if
    and when necessary.

    This is your innate superpower.

    And like any superhero, you don't have to wield your power all the
    time. It's simply there.


    Simply there for your confident weilding as needed, whenever needed.

    Take a moment, just jot down what that looks like.

    What's it like to confidently wield your superpower when it's
    needed?

    Allow that vision to come to life on the paper. How does it feel
    having this power at your disposal?

    As you come to completion writing, thank your power for always
    being here, just acknowledging it, reacquainting yourself with
    this power.

    Like a fish swimming, it's not something they think about so much.
    It just happens naturally.

    Who would like to share what came up?

    [snip]

    Beautiful. I like the present tense version of all those as
    well. It was great. Simple ways of living, that are empowered by
    your superpower there.  Nice, thank you.

    [snip]

    Having those actions are natural processes, part of your
    superpower of being on purpose in your life. Thank you.

    So, the next little bit is take a moment to anchor in your body
    which means to make a mental note to yourself, what it feels like
    having this power.

    You've taken a moment to notice the power. Now just taking a
    moment to remember the feeling, the sensation, maybe the voice or
    posture of this power.  As it's always here, we may not always
    notice what it's like, so just take a moment and notice what it's
    like to have this power.  How does it feel in your body?

    Once you've got it fully burned into your memory, we'll move on to
    the next segment here, which is notice seen the things that
    disrupt and occlude your awareness of your power. It's not
    occluding your power, which is always there. But just your
    awareness might get blocked or distracted from the fact that you
    have this power.

    More of a mental thing, maybe just as discussion, what are some of
    the things that block you from recognizing your power? For me, for
    example is worrying about what people will think about me.

    [snip]

    We'll go down that road for a bit. Tonight, what are some of the
    things that block your awareness of your power, and your
    connection to purpose?

    The next exercise is: allow allow our brain to spiral out of
    control for a bit; we'll stay in control, but we're just going to
    let, have some fun with this.

    And writing, starting with the top layer. If I try to recall, like
    "what will people think?" kind of idea.  You know,.. "what if they
    don't respect what you're trying to do" or, you know, whichever
    language fits for you best in that regard.

    And "if there's not enough time" kind of as the top level, big
    fear that I heard. And so these, take a moment to write that down:
    the top level fear that's easy to recognize.

    We're about to exaggerate it. Yes. Yeah, but for now just, like,
    [use] "there's not enough time" [as the topmost fear], something
    external to yourself, so "not enough time" and then the "people's
    reaction" kind of thing.


    And so, right above that line, "what might happen if..." And then
    you've got that biggest fear, showing up. So you go one
    level... if that happens, go one level deeper. If there's not
    enough time what's going to happen? Write that down.  If people
    don't respect you... what might happen?


    I've never done this exercise in parallel. So if you get stuck
    just speak up, but go down about five levels at least. Just let
    your mind go crazy about what disaster might happen.

    [snip]

    Yeah. We're just. Yeah, yeah, Yeah, like make it worse make it
    worse all the way down.

    In a way, have fun with it but these are real fears that your mind
    is bringing up to you each day.

    Go at least five levels, and if you're on a roll just keep it
    rolling.

    [What if I get to something positive?]

    That's actually fine is keep rolling through it, what might happen
    if this positive thing happens?

    Well yeah, the self talk also could be part of it, you know, "I
    talk down to myself" and therefore, this might happen. Therefore,
    this might happen...

    Whatever it may be, this is really, we're allowing the brain to
    just go crazy and get all this stuff out there, so we can see
    clearly what's in here [points to head] as a background noise.

    [snip]

    Yeah. Beautiful. Yeah. Again, thank you for driving down into
    that. Again, we're putting onto paper. This is what the background
    noise may be as I'm going through the day. It was like "this is
    what I'm up against? Oh no!" kind of thing.


    So, dropping back down to visualization mode, reconnect with that
    anchoring we did a while ago, where you know how it feels. You
    feel your positive superpower. Ready for you at any moment.

    Again, not every moment, just as it's needed. You use it
    skillfully.  You use it wisely. Once you're fully connected again
    with your superpower, that's always there and your awareness is
    fully connected, take a look at that mind chatter that you wrote
    down.

    How does your superpower serve you clearing through this mind
    chatter? What are some ways you can wield your superpower,
    skillfully, wisely, artfully, in the face this background mind
    chatter?

    [snip]

    Yes, Thor is like, Yeah, he's not bothered. He's like yeah, it
    doesn't matter. Perfect. Yeah. Thor as a perfect archetype for her
    inner strength. Absolutely. Breathe into that.

    [snip]

    Right. Yeah, exactly. There's the power you have
    [to connect with others], what is business but connections with
    people? And so that's a perfect power to build the connections
    that the company has, and new ones that are needed in the
    future. So yeah. Breathe into that, that is a natural skill that
    you have, and it serves your role.

    [snip]

    And so, this is live interactive like so it's kind of a freestyle
    as serves the group. So, thank you for deep dive.
