Today in Bold Life Brotherhood, we talked about our fears and how they
can be amplified by focusing on them.  This discussion led to talking
about keeping journals of world travels.  How have we changed over
time?  What things have stayed the same?

We next talked about ways to resolve conflict within relationships.
At the end of the call we set stretches to bring love and closure to
relationships that do not serve us.
