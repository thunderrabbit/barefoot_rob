Tonight was our first meeting in the month of looking at SOVEREIGNTY.
We looked at ways we give way to our unconscious reactions and
selected likely opportunities to make conscious choices that work
better for us better in the long term.

For me, I talked about my unconscious-driven nit-picking of Lin buying
things we don't need.  It's her money and it's not worth a fight to
save money.
