Tonight in [Bold Life Brotherhood](https://www.robnugen.com/bold-life-brotherhood/), we described our realtime felt
experience in our bodies.  e.g. "I feel the slight pressure in my
fingertips as I push these plastic shapes on the keyboard. I feel the
intake of air filling my lungs and stomach stretching as I breathe."

Each man spoke for a minute, narrating his felt experience.  Then we amped it up for each of two rounds:

1. Close your eyes and do the same, share what is happening for you
   now..

2. Feeling *inside* your body, *inside* your skin, narrate what are
   you experiencing in realtime (not what your skin feels, but what
   your internal parts feel)

Quite a cool experience!
