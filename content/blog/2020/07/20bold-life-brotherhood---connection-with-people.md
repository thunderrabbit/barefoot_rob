In the third week on CONNECTION, we focused on our connections with
other people.   What do you think they SHOULD be doing?   How might
these ideas point to things that you can do instead of changing the
other person?

Quite some great insights tonight.  I discovered ways in which I am
not taking care of myself, and some ways I can enjoy my work more.

* What do you think your favorite person SHOULD do?

* What does this "SHOULD" point to you doing (for) yourself?
