I'm super pleased with how the beta versions of my Design Your Day workshops have been going. 

I'm so happy to hear my friends moving forward on projects that they've been wanting to do for a while!

I plan to run a weekend training on Finding Your Life Purpose to more deeply connect to our Heart as the compass in our lives.

Each person has their own heart and their own life mission. Their own reason for being here on Earth.  I teach ways to connect more deeply with purpose and to bring that into daily life.

Email me if you'd like to jump in on the daily Design Your Day circles, held at 7:30am JST each day.
