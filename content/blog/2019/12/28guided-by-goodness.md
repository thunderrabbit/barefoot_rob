Today I saw a woman feeling frustrated with a small child crying.  She
was griping at him as he was crying.

I watched for a bit from a distance as she was like しょうがない！ママ
一人からしょうがない！(It's too bad! I'm alone, so too bad!)

I sighed and walked away. I could hear him crying so I turned back,
praying for some insight on how to help.  I saw her riding the
bicycle, but then she stopped and got off to engage the boy again.  I
found myself walking toward them.

I put my bag to one side and gently walked up to her.  I put my hand
between her and the child in his bicycle seat.

I invited her to breathe, and I just held her with my eyes.  I reached
out and held her hands for a bit.  I hugged her and she seemed
appreciative.

After about 30+ seconds of hug, I reached my hand back and gently
touched the (coat sleeve) wrist of the boy, who was still crying.

After a bit, I held both of their hands at the same time, intending to
act as an interface to help them reconnect.

I said in Japanese 私の日本語は下手ですけど、怒ってることを聞こえます。
(my Japanese is bad, but I can listen to your anger.)  In English I
said "I can handle it.  He is very small."

I gave her my card and invited her to bring her anger to me.

I hope I helped her reconnect with her goodness as a parent.
