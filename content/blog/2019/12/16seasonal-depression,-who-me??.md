I hate winter.

There.  I said it.  I hate the cold weather, dry air.

But mostly I hate the shorter days!

I have always thought it was weird that sunlight could affect people's
mood, and yet, I love the sun.  My favorite day of the year is summer
solstice.  If only I could have that much sun every day!!!

In October, I planned and posted three (3) workshops which I led in
November.  In November, I enjoyed the workshops, but could not quite
get my brain around posting more.

Now it's mid December and I am like wth happened and just counting the
days until the daylight hours start increasing again.

Today in my peer counseling group, I explored this idea that *I have
not been doing the right things*, even though, strictly speaking, the
things I have done are great!  I went to Japanese class; I created
art; I worked on my website.

"It's just like the day is gone so quickly," I said, and it hit me.
Maybe I am affected by the lack of sunlight in winter.

So, what can I do to change my state?

I can Be Okay with hibernating this month.  Just create art and enjoy
the process.  In the next week, I will post another Past Life Memories
workshop, another eye gazing workshop.. to be held in early 2020.

Looking forward to seeing you all then!
