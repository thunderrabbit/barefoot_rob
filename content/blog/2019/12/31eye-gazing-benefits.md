There is an ancient practice known as eye-gazing, whereby two
participants stare into each other's eyes for an extended period of
time.  When eye contact between two people is initiated and
maintained, an invisible energetic circuit is established which is
known to induce euphoria, visions, past life experiences, and even
remote viewing.  From here it is possible to reach higher states of
consciousness.  The saying 'eyes are the window to the soul' has much
more meaning than we may realize.
