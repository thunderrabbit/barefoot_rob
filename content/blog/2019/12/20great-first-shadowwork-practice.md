I facilitated my first [ShadowWork](https://shadowwork.com/) practice
workshop on Sunday.  I judge it was a success!

Mark helped me facilitate after going through a training with me.

Five men attended, and two got to do work in the circle.  The first
man said he got what he needed, and the second said it was deeper than
expected.

Great to see real raw emotions and see men receive heartfelt support and love.
