The Law of Attraction is real, but maybe not in the way you've heard
portrayed.  "Think of something and it comes to you" brings to mind
people thinking of a new fancy car, but still not see it in their
driveway so assume LoA is a LoAd of Hooey.

But let's go to a more subtle level.  In the same way that
[my focus matters](/blog/2019/07/08/my-focus-matters/), I tend to
bring experiences to myself based on my intention or attention.
Focusing on the good parts of my day allows me to see more good parts
to my day, and keeps me in a happier state of mind.
