Have you ever found yourself flying like a bird, only to later realize
it was a dream?

Have you been chased by "bad guys" or haunted by scary situations in
your dreams?

"Lucid dreaming" is a state of dreaming while being aware that you are
dreaming.  Lucid dreaming allows me to have more fun flying dreams and
fewer scary dreams.  This is how I got started:

There are a few techniques I have used at different times of my life.

1. Start a dream journal.  Prepare a notebook and pen, and leave it
   next to you when you go to sleep.  Immediately upon waking, write
   down *anything* that you can recall.  A sketch, a sentence, even a
   single drawn line or single word can help.  This process of writing
   or drawing helps connect your waking conscious mind with your
   dreaming mind.

   Do this consistently over some weeks or months and you will soon
   have more to write than you possibly have time for upon waking.

2. Check to see if you are dreaming.  There are several different ways
   to do so.  Do one or more of these tests throughout the day, like
   every hour or so.  Eventually you will do a test while dreaming
   and find yourself lucid dreaming!

   *Test 1*: Read this sentence.  Read it again.  Close your eyes for a
   few seconds.  Open your eyes and read it again.  Did it change?
   No?  Then you are probably not dreaming.

   Did the sentence change?  Then you are dreaming.  Congratulations!

   *Test two*: Stand up.  Look up toward a point way up above you and
   jump to it.  Did you come back down?  Then you are probably not
   dreaming.

   Did you stay in the air or fly to that point?  You are
   dreaming!

   *Test three*: Count your fingers.  Count them again.  Do you have the
   normal number?  Can you do it easily?  You are probably not
   dreaming.

   Do you have extra fingers than normal?  Fewer fingers than normal?
   Congratulations, you are dreaming!  (Or you may have just had an
   accident.  Call emergency services!)

One other technique I have read is to fall asleep with the intention
of being aware in your dreams.  I personally have not had success with
this technique, but it may work for you.
