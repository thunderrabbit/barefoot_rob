In two weeks I will be leading an Eye Gazing Workshop near Shibuya
station.

To help plan my first workshop, Rin asked me to choose something that
made me really excited.

I told her I would have to think about it, and a couple days later it
suddenly came to me as the perfect workshop.

After determining what I wanted the final outcome to be, the workshop
plan went through a few iterations, with support from [Georgie](https://www.facebook.com/babay0ga/), Mark Wild,
[Soness](https://www.yourspeakingjourney.com/), [Kevin Turner](https://www.shamanism-asia.com/), and others.

    They say our eyes are the window to the soul.  This workshop will give
    us a chance to look more deeply into ourselves and more deeply into
    those around us.

    The process is simple, and the results can be profound.  You may
    discover parts about yourself that you didn't know where there.

    In this workshop, we will be looking into the eyes of people that we
    may never have met before.  We will have a chance to sit with multiple
    participants, with a small break in between each person.

    It's important to have an intention before each eye gazing practice,
    so be sure to have some possible intentions in mind.  Some examples
    might be

    “I intend to get to know myself better”
    “I intend to connect with my intuition”
    “I intend to practice acceptance of others”
    “I intend to practice acceptance of myself”

    Let’s enjoy learning about ourselves and each other.

Location: between Shibuya and Shinsen stations on Dogenzaka

One woman said "now I know who I am."

    2人1組になり、ペアを組んだ相手の目を見続け、その観察の結果を参加者
    同士でシェアするユニークなワークショップは、多くの気づきと学びがあ
    り、自身のその日の状態をより良く知り、心のメンテナンスができた貴重
    な機会となった。

    A unique workshop in which two people form a pair, keep an eye on
    the paired opponents, and share the results of the observation
    among the participants, have a lot of awareness and learning, and
    improve the status of their day. It was a valuable opportunity to
    know and maintain my mind.   (translation by Google)
