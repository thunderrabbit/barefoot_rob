Growing up, we are taught various things in order to guide us toward
being a fully functioning adult.  Some of the messages we got as
children do not serve us as adults (and some didn't serve us a
children!) so affirmations are an easy way to help retrain our brain
to have positive messages rolling through.

I had heard of affirmations many times before, but my
[coaching sessions with Rin](https://feelonenesslove.com) really
helped me see the value of affirmations.  Rin helped me uncover some
of the messages that were unconsciously reverberating in my mind, and
helped me write messages that would serve me instead of keep me
stagnant.

Some of them were basic, and would probably serve most people.

    "I love myself"
    "I accept myself"

Some others were more specific to me and my situation.

    "I smile freely"
    "I love expressing myself"
    "People are interested in what I have to say"
    "Itâ€™s safe to express who I am"

Some came from intuition and memory.

    "My heart is connected to my abundance"
    "I have plenty of work I love"
    "I trust the world"
    "I trust my guidance"

I have affirmations listed in my daily R.O.B.O.T. pages, and just
recently moved one to the top:

    "I smile freely"

and added a ringer

    "God dwells in me as me."
