In relationships where everyone is equally able to take care of
themselves, you need to take care of yourself first.  In general, you
are the only person who truly knows what you need, and everyone else
is too busy taking care of themselves to take care of you.

(And to be clear, I am speaking to you, dear reader, not just the
generalized "you" which really means "I".)

Today I learned the value of taking care of myself as related to my
(online) men's group.  Because I had not done my meditation nor my
other morning things, I was not prepared to be in the circle.

In the end, I learned I need to put my own needs above my perceived
"needs" of the circle.

One man even mentioned that one of the indicators of burnout is the
belief that "I am the only one who can do it."

If you hear that in your life, is it time to evaluate the roles you
have taken in life?
