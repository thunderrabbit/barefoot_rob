We've all heard the quote something like

    Insanity is repeating the same thing
     and expecting a different result.

I just realized that I have been trying to apply that quote too
strongly in my life.  I have low-key assumed I have to make some huge
radical change in my life in order to have anything different.

That belief was blocking my ability to make lasting change.  I don't
have to take on a huge change or multiple changes all at once.

I can make a single, manageable, bite-sized change.

The trick is in finding what to change.  That's where I come in.
Let's find your bite-sized change together.

With the power of exponential growth, these small changes accumulate.

Allow your new habits to bring your empowered life.
