Recently, I have had a big server upgrade that has been challenging me on
how to finish it.  Yesterday I asked a friend of mine if he could
look over my plan for the upgrade.

He agreed, and I began to write the email that articulated my plan.

Just in writing out the email I recalled the value of rubber ducking.

The idea is that you explain the problem to a rubber duck,
giving enough information so that the rubber duck can understand.

(I like to add the idea that rubber duck brains are not very big, so
I need to articulate things in bite-sized pieces.)

In doing this process, I noticed a couple of solutions that will help
me move forward with my plan.  It also helped me get a sense of how
big the project is, and where its steps need to be fleshed out.

Thank you, rubber duck!
