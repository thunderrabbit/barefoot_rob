When out and about, I like to allow plenty of time between clients so
I can be relaxed while in transit.  Today I took it a step (ha)
further by walking quite slowly.

After slowing myself down physically, I noticed a sense of peace come
over me.  An awareness of joyful awareness like a tautology of being
happy because you're happy.

Time lost its meaning as I simply walked step by step, aware of the
surroundings like being there for the first time.  I was practically
on vacation on my way to work.

There's so much to see!  Each leaf on each tree has a story.
Each brick on each wall is unique if you look closely enough.

Walking down a walkway I have been many (!) times before, I noticed
something new that I hadn't seen before.

Each shop has its own design (and they clash like wow)!

What happens for you when you walk slowly and breathe?
