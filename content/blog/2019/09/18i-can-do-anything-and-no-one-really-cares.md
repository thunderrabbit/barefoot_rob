So long as I do stuff within a normalized range, no one really cares
what I do.

I can spend all day trying to figure out one bug, or ignore it.  No
one will know the difference.  I could even quit my job, and just a
few people will notice.  (some people very much so, but 99+% will
not)

Re-reading the above sounds like I am suicidal, but I am not.  My
point is quite exactly the opposite.

I can wear shoes or not, and no one cares.  But I care.  I *love*
being barefoot 99% of the time, and am working toward doing it more.

I can work on Marble Track 3 or not; no one cares.  But I care!  I
*love* the project; I love talking about it, I love its steady
progress building up to something over time. I love the ridiculousness
of it; I love people's incredulous reactions when I say 1 second of
video took 2 hours to make (and it's going to be a lot higher, tbh..
2 hours per second is just for a *silent* video!)

I can stop doing workshops and no one cares..  But I care!  I did the
eye gazing workshop and it was great!

For some reason I have had (and still have) this fear that I cannot do
anything *different* from what I have been doing before, but this is
simply not true!  How untrue is it?

Just this past weekend I did stand a few minutes of up comedy for the
first time (with no prior practice nor planning) and it was fine; it
was easier than I expected.  I could do that, (or not, and no one
cares,) but I don't want to do that.

I want to put together a Silent Football game, though Rin has
recommended I focus on my Barefoot Rob brand first, but I don't wanna!
What should I do?  ergg this is so confusing.

Instead of being frustrated, can I instead see the steading progress
forward like on Marble Track 3?

This is an age-old question, and the answer seems to be it does not
really matter; just do what I want to do!
