My TV says if I buy this or that toothpaste / car / ______ then I will be happy.  What TV doesn't tell me is that happiness is temporary.  Instead of buying my way into temporary happiness, I can sit my way into lasting happiness.

Sitting allows me to reset my brain to my center, my spirit, my essence.  This is where permanent happiness resides.  In this moment, sitting in what I call the Ever Present Present, I can just be, happily.
