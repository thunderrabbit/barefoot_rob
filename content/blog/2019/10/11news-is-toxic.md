News is toxic.

I might go further to say TV is toxic, but let's start with news.

News is designed to grab my attention, make me shocked to see what
someone or something did.  News often riles me up with fear, anger or
sadness.  "How could anyone do that?"  (In some cases, that very reaction is subtly
subtitled, "I am much better because I would never do that," which in
itself causes separation, but that's another topic)

This reaction of disgust triggers desire to know more; there is like a
dopamine response of "I am good; you are bad" and another subtle dose
of "the world is scary" mixed in there.

I don't need fear in my heart / mind about what some person or some
thing did or is doing way over there.  Compared to me, the world is a
big place, and that stuff happening over there is not something I need
to control.

added spin + politics

If it gets bad enough, they'll come let you know.

So I have a challenge for you: stop watching news for a day and see if
you notice anythig whether a craving for news or a sense of calm or
anything else.
