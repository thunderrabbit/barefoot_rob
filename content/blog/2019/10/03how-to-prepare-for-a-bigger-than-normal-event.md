This simple technique really works and
I have anecdotal scientific proof to prove it.

### Step 1: make a list of things to do

The first thing to do is make a list of what you have to do, but START
THE LIST LONG BEFORE the event!

Today I am headed to the airport for a little trip to see friends,
learn some stuff, and hang out with Lin.  I started writing my packing
list about 2 weeks ago.

In prepping for this day, I started writing a TO DO list a few days
ago.

Last night and this morning, I have smoothly prepped, packed,
meditated, and even had enough extra time to chat with some of my
peeps online.

<b>How it works:</b>

[Barbara Oakley](https://barbaraoakley.com/)'s course [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/) talked about the
pomodoro technique, which is based on the fact that our brains need
some time to chill out between times of working hard.

Allowing a couple of weeks to make the list allows the brain to work
at its prime, creating and finding connections between apparently
disparate objects or experiences.

The idea of slowly compiling a list reminds me in ways of GTD, [Getting
Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/), which suggests we have One Single List of things to do,
and then we just smoothly and easily go through the list while not
having to keep a lot of stuff in mind.
