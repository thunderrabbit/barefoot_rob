Are you getting your recommended daily allowance of Vitamin Touch?

If you’re an American in Japan, probably not.

Maybe you like it this way.  Maybe not.

In either case, there’s a physical touch barrier in Tokyo, unless in
trains.

Why are there women-only carriages on trains?

Physical touch is a fundamental human need that is essential for
healthy development and well-being. People who lack physical touch may
experience increased levels of stress, anxiety, and depression.

Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for those deprived of physical touch
to seek it out through other means, which can sometimes lead to
inappropriate or harmful behavior.

Have you ever heard of Harlow's monkey experiment? Conducted by
psychologist Harry Harlow in the 1950s, the experiment involved
separating baby monkeys from their mothers and providing them with two
surrogate "mothers" - one made of wire with a bottle of milk, and the
other covered in a soft terrycloth but without milk. The baby monkeys
spent more time clinging to the cloth surrogate, even when it meant
foregoing food from the wire surrogate, indicating that contact
comfort and emotional attachment were more important to them than
their physiological needs.

Touch is as critical as food, just not in the obvious ways of starving
to death without it.  Lack of physical touch decreases our emotional
well-being.

Put another way, physical touch increases our emotional well being.
Our bodies hold our emotional history.  I’ve been talking about that
for years.

I started a men’s group here to create a place to get those emotions
out in a safe container.

Now I’m creating a consent group to create a place to explore physical
touch in a safe container.

Each Cuddle Party starts with an hour-long mini workshop where we
explore the rules of consent and communication in a touch-positive
environment. Participants have the opportunity to practice setting
boundaries and expressing their desires in a safe and non-judgmental
space. The remainder of the event is dedicated to consensual touch and
cuddling, where participants can connect with others in a platonic and
nurturing way. Cuddle Parties can be a powerful tool for promoting
emotional well-being and creating a sense of community through safe,
consensual touch.

The parties are about getting back to basics: Communication basics: No
means No.

Physiological basics: the first communication between mother and
infant is through touch.

If you’re still reading (and agreeing!) I’d love to have you at my
next Cuddle Party event.

I am the first person in Japan seeking accreditation from Cuddle Party
HQ in the US. All events are conducted in English as the core of the
event is a communication workshop about consent..  You don’t have to
cuddle anyone at a cuddle Party.  You can just sit be present with
yourself.  This is part of the ground rules which form the basis of
the Welcome Circle.

I was crying for a hug in my first 3 months in Japan.  If this
resonates with you, let’s share a hug, with consent.

Come get your Vitamin T and your heart filled with connection.

I don’t expect to change Japanese culture; I just seek to create a
safe place for us within the culture to share the Vitamin Touch we
need.
