Last night, trying to pour a full carton of mikan juice into my thermos,
I tipped it over onto my desk.  I quickly picked it up before it *all*
gushed out, but it was still quite a mess.

I didn't think to take a photo of this as an IG moment, but I did quickly
switch from "fffuccckkk shit shit shit shit" to a nice deep breath and
"thank you God for guiding me."
"Thank you Spirit for helping me find the value in this moment."

Though I was quite tired, I knew I'd be better off cleaning it up
in liquid form instead of sticky-sugar-glue form, so I started cleaning.
Fortunately, my electronics remained undrenched; I was grateful
I therefore would just need to toss or dry out some papers,
then wipe up the spill.

During the cleanup, I suddenly heard more dripping as mikan juice
reached the back edge of the desk and cascaded to the floor.
I've got a layer of interlocking rubber tiles to protect the floor
from bumps and dents, but they certainly didn't stop mikan juice
from reaching the actual flooring below them.

Fortunately, the rubber floor tiles which are literally pinned down
by my desk didn't get
flooded, so it was pretty easy to clean all the ones with mikan juice below them.

In the cleanup process, I moved my personal computer to the right hand side
of my desk.  I'll take this opportunity to close the left hand side of my desk
by the end of July, when I'll no longer be using my soon-to-be-ex company laptop.

All said, this was a great chance to toss some old papers, downsize my desk
space, and prepare to have more floor space in my room.  yayyy!
