Do you constantly desire to be liked and accepted by people?

Do you feel a deep sense of despair and loneliness?

Do you dim yourself down in order to fit in?


If you said YES, you’re not alone.


Growing up as a young man, my heart was closed to real connection and
intimacy. I sought sex with no strings attached, cheated on my
partners, and said yes to engagement and marriage for the sake of
security. I was constantly chasing validation and attention from
women. It seemed normal to me! But in reality, I was driven by
desperation and an insatiable thirst for love and acceptance.

Now I’m a leader of men, having grown ManKind Project Japan for 9
years, inspiring and training men to lead the group (or their own
group!) After letting go of a 12 year marriage that had become
dysfunctional and giving my ex-wife our house, I finally discovered
who I truly am as a heart-centered man. Today I Iive in a place of
alignment with my dream woman who encourages me to be a better version
of myself each day.

What would happen if you let go of your stories of inadequacy as your identity?

What if you were guided by a healthy and functional man to model your
truth of masculinity?

How would you feel to thrive in your vision of life?


What Men Are Saying

*“Rob is amazing. He is a perfect facilitator in every way. He is
 caring, kind, self-effacing, honest. Ten out of ten.”*

– Andy Boerger

*“Rob has been an enormous blessing in my life. His facilitation work,
 guidance, and leadership have helped me to sense, understand, express
 and process my own emotions. In my personal experience Rob is
 excellent at both counseling and facilitation. He can serve a wide
 range of clients because he doesn’t have his own agenda, and pays
 close attention to the subjective and personal aspects of one’s
 emotions, life circumstances, and individual values, goals, or
 priorities. Whether you are struggling with overwhelming emotions,
 seeking greater self understanding, or simply desire more clarity
 about the direction you want to go in life, Rob can provide the
 space, tools, and support for you to discover your own wisdom.”*

– Nathan Brandli

*“Rob, you have helped me immensely for a long period of time. And I
 know that you have a talent for facilitation. In fact everybody in
 this whole group knows what great facilitation you do and how you are
 able to tune into people and help them to get through and go on to
 find the deeper level of their beings.”*

– Will Ewing
