I was so happy to see Teru so happy for a chance to go barefoot!
He and I walked happily barefoot from Musashi-Koyama station,
starting with me joining him balancing on the curb.

We met Hide in the circular Meeting Place in the park,
and explored its cool concentric rings of soil an inlaid brick.

Really sweet to have Hide join us; I see him as an elite athelete,
as we have known each other for a while in the SOGO Fitness community.

I received several gifts of seed pods and small stones from Teru,
who seems to be a natural scientist at heart!
His genki exploratory nature reminds me of myself. (^_^)

The park was full of visitors enjoying the weather, which wasn't chilly at all!
