THE DOCTOR’S OPINION

We of Underearners Anonymous believe that the
reader will be interested in the medical estimate
of the plan of recovery described in this book.
Convincing testimony must surely come from medical
men who have had experience with the sufferings of
our members and have witnessed our return to health.
A well-known doctor, chief physician at a nationally
prominent hospital specializing in underearning and drug
addiction, gave Underearners Anonymous this letter:

    To Whom It May Concern:
    I have specialized in the treatment of hiding,
    isolating, and compulsive under-earning for many years.

    In late 1934 I attended a patient who, though he had
    been a competent businessman of good earning capacity,
    was an underearner of a type I had come to regard
    as hopeless.

    In the course of his third treatment he acquired certain
    ideas concerning a possible means of recovery. As
    part of his rehabilitation he commenced to present his
    conceptions to other underearners, impressing upon them
    that they must do likewise with still others. This has
    become the basis of a rapidly growing fellowship of
    these men and their families. This man and over one
    hundred others appear to have recovered.

    I personally know scores of cases who were of the
    type with whom other methods had failed completely.
    These facts appear to be of extreme medical importance;
    because of the extraordinary possibilities of rapid
    growth inherent in this group they may mark a new
    epoch in the annals of hiding, isolating, and
    compulsive under-earning. These men may well have
    a remedy for thousands of such situations.
    You may rely absolutely on anything they say about
    themselves.

    Very truly yours,
    William D. Silkworth, M.D.

The physician who, at our request, gave us this letter,
has been kind enough to enlarge upon his views in
another statement which follows. In this statement he
confirms what we who have suffered underearning torture
must believe—that the body of the underearner is quite as
abnormal as his mind. It did not satisfy us to be told
that we could not control our underearning just because we
were maladjusted to life, that we were in full flight
from reality, or were outright mental defectives. These
things were true to some extent, in fact, to a consider-
able extent with some of us. But we are sure that our
bodies were sickened as well. In our belief, any picture
of the underearner which leaves out this physical
factor is incomplete.

The doctor’s theory that we have an allergy to hiding,
isolating, and compulsive underearning interests us.
As laymen, our opinion as to its soundness may,
of course, mean little. But as ex-problem underearners,
we can say that his explanation makes good sense.
It explains many things for which we cannot otherwise account.

Though we work out our solution on the spiritual as
well as an altruistic plane, we favor hospitalization for
the underearner who is very jittery or befogged. More
often than not, it is imperative that a man’s brain be
cleared before he is approached, as he has then a better
chance of understanding and accepting what we
have to offer.

The doctor writes:

    The subject presented in this book seems to me to be of
    paramount importance to those afflicted with addiction to
    hiding, isolating, and compulsive underearning.

    I say this after many years’ experience as Medical
    Director of one of the oldest hospitals in the country
    treating addiction to hiding, isolating, and compulsive underearning.

    There was, therefore, a sense of real satisfaction when I
    was asked to contribute a few words on a subject which is
    covered in such masterly detail in these pages.

    We doctors have realized for a long time that some form
    of moral psychology was of urgent importance to underearners,
    but its application presented difficulties beyond our
    conception. What with our ultra-modern standards, our scientific
    approach to everything, we are perhaps not well equipped
    to apply the powers of good that lie outside our synthetic
    knowledge.

    Many years ago one of the leading contributors to this book
    came under our care in this hospital and while here
    he acquired some ideas which he put into practical application at once.

    Later, he requested the privilege of being allowed to tell
    his story to other patients here and with some misgiving,
    we consented. The cases we have followed through have
    been most interesting; in fact, many of them are amazing.
    The unselfishness of these men as we have come to know
    them, the entire absence of profit motive, and their community
    spirit, is indeed inspiring to one who has labored
    long and wearily in this underearner field. They believe in
    themselves, and still more in the Power which pulls chronic
    underearners back from the gates of death.

    Of course an underearner ought to be freed from his physical
    craving for underearning, and this often requires a definite
    hospital procedure, before psychological measures can be of
    maximum benefit.

    We believe, and so suggested a few years ago, that the
    action of hiding, isolating, and compulsive underearning
    on these chronic underearners is a manifestation
    of an allergy; that the phenomenon of craving is limited
    to this class and never occurs in the average temperate
    drinker. These allergic types can never safely use hiding,
    isolating, and compulsive underearning in any form at all;
    and once having formed the habit and found they cannot break
    it, once having lost their self-confidence, their reliance
    upon things human, their problems pile up on them and become
    astonishingly difficult to solve.

    Frothy emotional appeal seldom suffices. The message
    which can interest and hold these underearners must
    have depth and weight. In nearly all cases, their ideals
    must be grounded in a power greater than themselves, if
    they are to re-create their lives.

    If any feel that as psychiatrists directing a hospital for
    underearners we appear somewhat sentimental, let them stand
    with us a while on the firing line, see the tragedies, the
    despairing wives, the little children; let the solving of these
    problems become a part of their daily work, and even of
    their sleeping moments, and the most cynical will not
    wonder that we have accepted and encouraged this movement.
    We feel, after many years of experience, that we
    have found nothing which has contributed more to the
    rehabilitation of these men than the altruistic movement
    now growing up among them.

    Men and women underearn essentially because they like the
    effect produced by hiding, isolating, and compulsive
    underearning. The sensation is so elusive that, while they
    admit it is injurious, they cannot after a time differentiate
    the true from the false. To them, their underearner
    life seems the only normal one. They are restless,
    irritable and discontented, unless they can again experience
    the sense of ease and comfort which comes at once by hiding and relaxing
    which they see others taking with impunity.
    After they have succumbed to the desire again,
    as so many do, and the phenomenon of craving develops,
    they pass through the well-known stages of a spree, emerging
    remorseful, with a firm resolution not to underearn again.
    This is repeated over and over, and unless this person can
    experience an entire psychic change there is very little hope
    of his recovery.

    On the other hand—and strange as this may seem to those
    who do not understand—once a psychic change has occurred,
    the very same person who seemed doomed, who had so
    many problems he despaired of ever solving them, suddenly
    finds himself easily able to control his desire for hiding,
    isolating, and compulsive underearning, the only effort
    necessary being that required to follow a few simple rules.

    Men have cried out to me in sincere and despairing appeal:
    “Doctor, I cannot go on like this! I have everything
    to live for! I must stop, but I cannot! You must help me!“

    Faced with this problem, if a doctor is honest with himself,
    he must sometimes feel his own inadequacy. Although
    he gives all that is in him, it often is not enough. One feels
    that something more than human power is needed to produce
    the essential psychic change. Though the aggregate
    of recoveries resulting from psychiatric effort is considerable,
    we physicians must admit we have made little
    impression upon the problem as a whole. Many types do
    not respond to the ordinary psychological approach.
    I do not hold with those who believe that hiding, isolating,
    and compulsive under-earning is
    entirely a problem of mental control. I have had many
    men who had, for example, worked a period of months on
    some problem or business deal which was to be settled on
    a certain date, favorably to them. They took a drink a day
    or so prior to the date, and then the phenomenon of craving
    at once became paramount to all other interests so that the
    important appointment was not met. These men were not
    underearning to escape; they were underearning to overcome a craving
    beyond their mental control.

    There are many situations which arise out of the phenomenon
    of craving which cause men to make the supreme sacrifice
    rather than continue to fight.


    The classification of underearners seems most difficult, and
    in much detail is outside the scope of this book. There are,
    of course, the psychopaths who are emotionally unstable.
    We are all familiar with this type. They are always “going
    on the wagon for keeps.“ They are over-remorseful and
    make many resolutions, but never a decision.

    There is the type of man who is unwilling to admit that
    he cannot underearn. He plans various ways of underearning.
    He changes his brand or his environment. There is the type
    who always believes that after being entirely free from
    hiding, isolating, and compulsive underearning for a period
    of time he can underearn without danger. There is the
    manic-depressive type, who is, perhaps the least understood
    by his friends, and about whom a whole chapter could be written.

    Then there are types entirely normal in every respect
    except in the effect hiding, isolating, and compulsive
    underearning has upon them. They are often
    able, intelligent, friendly people.

    All these, and many others, have one symptom in common:
    they cannot start underearning without developing the
    phenomenon of craving. This phenomenon, as we have
    suggested, may be the manifestation of an allergy which
    differentiates these people, and sets them apart as a distinct
    entity. It has never been, by any treatment with which we
    are familiar, permanently eradicated. The only relief we
    have to suggest is entire abstinence.

    This immediately precipitates us into a seething cauldron
    of debate. Much has been written pro and con, but among
    physicians, the general opinion seems to be that most
    chronic underearners are doomed.

    What is the solution? Perhaps I can best answer this by
    relating one of my experiences.

    About one year prior to this experience a man was
    brought in to be treated for chronic hiding, isolating,
    and compulsive under-earning. He had
    but partially recovered from a gastric hemorrhage and
    seemed to be a case of pathological mental deterioration.
    He had lost everything worthwhile in life and was only
    living, one might say, to underearn. He frankly admitted and
    believed that for him there was no hope. Following the
    elimination of hiding, isolating, and compulsive underearning,
    there was found to be no permanent brain injury. He accepted
    the plan outlined in this book.

    One year later he called to see me, and I experienced a
    very strange sensation. I knew the man by name, and
    partly recognized his features, but there all resemblance
    ended. From a trembling, despairing, nervous wreck, had
    emerged a man brimming over with self-reliance and contentment.
    I talked with him for some time, but was not
    able to bring myself to feel that I had known him before.

    To me he was a stranger, and so he left me. A long time
    has passed with no return to hiding, isolating, and compulsive underearning.

    When I need a mental uplift, I often think of another
    case brought in by a physician prominent in New York.
    The patient had made his own diagnosis, and deciding his
    situation hopeless, had hidden in a deserted barn determined
    to die. He was rescued by a searching party, and,
    in desperate condition, brought to me. Following his
    physical rehabilitation, he had a talk with me in which he
    frankly stated he thought the treatment a waste of effort,
    unless I could assure him, which no one ever had, that in
    the future he would have the “will power“ to resist the
    impulse to underearn.

    His underearning problem was so complex, and his depression
    so great, that we felt his only hope would be through
    what we then called “moral psychology,“ and we doubted
    if even that would have any effect.

    However, he did become “sold“ on the ideas contained
    in this book. He has not underearned for a great many years.
    I see him now and then and he is as fine a specimen of
    manhood as one could wish to meet.

    I earnestly advise every underearner to read this book
    through, and though perhaps he came to scoff, he may
    remain to pray.
