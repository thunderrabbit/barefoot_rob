THE DOCTOR’S OPINION

We of Underearners Anonymous believe that the reader will be
interested in the medical estimate of the plan of recovery described
in this book.  Convincing testimony must surely come from medical men
who have had experience with the sufferings of our members and have
witnessed our return to health.  A well-known doctor, chief physician
at a nationally prominent hospital specializing in underearning and
drug addiction, gave Underearners Anonymous this letter:

    To Whom It May Concern:
    I have specialized in the treatment of hiding, isolating, and
    compulsive under-earning for many years.

    In late 1934 I attended a patient who, though he had been a
    competent businessman of good earning capacity, was an underearner
    of a type I had come to regard as hopeless.

    In the course of his third treatment he acquired certain ideas
    concerning a possible means of recovery. As part of his
    rehabilitation he commenced to present his conceptions to other
    underearners, impressing upon them that they must do likewise with
    still others. This has become the basis of a rapidly growing
    fellowship of these men and their families. This man and over one
    hundred others appear to have recovered.

    I personally know scores of cases who were of the type with whom
    other methods had failed completely.  These facts appear to be of
    extreme medical importance; because of the extraordinary
    possibilities of rapid growth inherent in this group they may mark
    a new epoch in the annals of hiding, isolating, and compulsive
    under-earning. These men may well have a remedy for thousands of
    such situations.  You may rely absolutely on anything they say
    about themselves.

    Very truly yours,
    William D. Silkworth, M.D.

The physician who, at our request, gave us this letter, has been kind
enough to enlarge upon his views in another statement which
follows. In this statement he confirms what we who have suffered
underearning torture must believe—that the body of the underearner is
quite as abnormal as his mind. It did not satisfy us to be told that
we could not control our underearning just because we were maladjusted
to life, that we were in full flight from reality, or were outright
mental defectives. These things were true to some extent, in fact, to
a consider- able extent with some of us. But we are sure that our
bodies were sickened as well. In our belief, any picture of the
underearner which leaves out this physical factor is incomplete.

The doctor’s theory that we have an allergy to hiding, isolating, and
compulsive underearning interests us.  As laymen, our opinion as to
its soundness may, of course, mean little. But as ex-problem
underearners, we can say that his explanation makes good sense.  It
explains many things for which we cannot otherwise account.

Though we work out our solution on the spiritual as well as an
altruistic plane, we favor hospitalization for the underearner who is
very jittery or befogged. More often than not, it is imperative that a
man’s brain be cleared before he is approached, as he has then a
better chance of understanding and accepting what we have to offer.

The doctor writes:

    The subject presented in this book seems to me to be of paramount
    importance to those afflicted with addiction to hiding, isolating,
    and compulsive underearning.

    I say this after many years’ experience as Medical Director of one
    of the oldest hospitals in the country treating addiction to
    hiding, isolating, and compulsive underearning.

    There was, therefore, a sense of real satisfaction when I was
    asked to contribute a few words on a subject which is covered in
    such masterly detail in these pages.

    We doctors have realized for a long time that some form of moral
    psychology was of urgent importance to underearners, but its
    application presented difficulties beyond our conception. What
    with our ultra-modern standards, our scientific approach to
    everything, we are perhaps not well equipped to apply the powers
    of good that lie outside our synthetic knowledge.

    Many years ago one of the leading contributors to this book came
    under our care in this hospital and while here he acquired some
    ideas which he put into practical application at once.

    Later, he requested the privilege of being allowed to tell his
    story to other patients here and with some misgiving, we
    consented. The cases we have followed through have been most
    interesting; in fact, many of them are amazing.  The unselfishness
    of these men as we have come to know them, the entire absence of
    profit motive, and their community spirit, is indeed inspiring to
    one who has labored long and wearily in this underearner
    field. They believe in themselves, and still more in the Power
    which pulls chronic underearners back from the gates of death.

    Of course an underearner ought to be freed from his physical
    craving for underearning, and this often requires a definite
    hospital procedure, before psychological measures can be of
    maximum benefit.

    We believe, and so suggested a few years ago, that the action of
    hiding, isolating, and compulsive underearning on these chronic
    underearners is a manifestation of an allergy; that the phenomenon
    of craving is limited to this class and never occurs in the
    average wage earner.  These allergic types can never safely use
    hiding, isolating, and compulsive underearning in any form at all;
    and once having formed the habit and found they cannot break it,
    once having lost their self-confidence, their reliance upon things
    human, their problems pile up on them and become astonishingly
    difficult to solve.

    Frothy emotional appeal seldom suffices. The message which can
    interest and hold these underearners must have depth and
    weight. In nearly all cases, their ideals must be grounded in a
    power greater than themselves, if they are to re-create their
    lives.

    If any feel that as psychiatrists directing a hospital for
    underearners we appear somewhat sentimental, let them stand with
    us a while on the firing line, see the tragedies, the despairing
    wives, the little children; let the solving of these problems
    become a part of their daily work, and even of their sleeping
    moments, and the most cynical will not wonder that we have
    accepted and encouraged this movement.  We feel, after many years
    of experience, that we have found nothing which has contributed
    more to the rehabilitation of these men than the altruistic
    movement now growing up among them.

    Men and women underearn essentially because they like the effects
    produced by hiding, isolating, and compulsive underearning. The
    sensation is so elusive that, while they admit it is injurious,
    they cannot after a time differentiate the true from the false. To
    them, their underearning life seems the only normal one. They are
    restless, irritable and discontented, unless they can again
    experience the sense of ease and comfort which comes at once by
    underearning and relaxing which they see others doing with
    impunity.  After they have succumbed to the desire again, as so
    many do, and the phenomenon of craving develops, they pass through
    the well-known stages of a spree, emerging remorseful, with a firm
    resolution not to underearn again.  This is repeated over and
    over, and unless this person can experience an entire psychic
    change there is very little hope of his recovery.

    On the other hand—and strange as this may seem to those who do not
    understand—once a psychic change has occurred, the very same
    person who seemed doomed, who had so many problems he despaired of
    ever solving them, suddenly finds himself easily able to control
    his desire for hiding, isolating, and compulsive underearning, the
    only effort necessary being that required to follow a few simple
    rules.

    Men have cried out to me in sincere and despairing appeal:
    “Doctor, I cannot go on like this! I have everything to live for!
    I must stop, but I cannot! You must help me!“

    Faced with this problem, if a doctor is honest with himself, he
    must sometimes feel his own inadequacy. Although he gives all that
    is in him, it often is not enough. One feels that something more
    than human power is needed to produce the essential psychic
    change. Though the aggregate of recoveries resulting from
    psychiatric effort is considerable, we physicians must admit we
    have made little impression upon the problem as a whole. Many
    types do not respond to the ordinary psychological approach.  I do
    not hold with those who believe that hiding, isolating, and
    compulsive underearning is entirely a problem of mental control. I
    have had many men who had, for example, worked a period of months
    on some problem or business deal which was to be settled on a
    certain date, favorably to them. They took a drink a day or so
    prior to the date, and then the phenomenon of craving at once
    became paramount to all other interests so that the important
    appointment was not met. These men were not underearning to
    escape; they were underearning to overcome a craving beyond their
    mental control.

    There are many situations which arise out of the phenomenon of
    craving which cause men to make the supreme sacrifice rather than
    continue to fight.


    The classification of underearners seems most difficult, and in
    much detail is outside the scope of this book. There are, of
    course, the psychopaths who are emotionally unstable.  We are all
    familiar with this type. They are always “going on the wagon for
    keeps.“ They are over-remorseful and make many resolutions, but
    never a decision.

    There is the type of man who is unwilling to admit that he cannot
    underearn. He plans various ways of underearning.  He changes his
    brand or his environment. There is the type who always believes
    that after being entirely free from hiding, isolating, and
    compulsive underearning for a period of time he can underearn
    without danger. There is the manic-depressive type, who is,
    perhaps the least understood by his friends, and about whom a
    whole chapter could be written.

    Then there are types entirely normal in every respect except in
    the effect hiding, isolating, and compulsive underearning has upon
    them. They are often able, intelligent, friendly people.

    All these, and many others, have one symptom in common: they
    cannot start underearning without developing the phenomenon of
    craving. This phenomenon, as we have suggested, may be the
    manifestation of an allergy which differentiates these people, and
    sets them apart as a distinct entity. It has never been, by any
    treatment with which we are familiar, permanently eradicated. The
    only relief we have to suggest is entire abstinence.

    This immediately precipitates us into a seething cauldron of
    debate. Much has been written pro and con, but among physicians,
    the general opinion seems to be that most chronic underearners are
    doomed.

    What is the solution? Perhaps I can best answer this by relating
    one of my experiences.

    About one year prior to this experience a man was brought in to be
    treated for chronic hiding, isolating, and compulsive
    under-earning. He had but partially recovered from a gastric
    hemorrhage and seemed to be a case of pathological mental
    deterioration.  He had lost everything worthwhile in life and was
    only living, one might say, to underearn. He frankly admitted and
    believed that for him there was no hope. Following the elimination
    of hiding, isolating, and compulsive underearning, there was found
    to be no permanent brain injury. He accepted the plan outlined in
    this book.

    One year later he called to see me, and I experienced a very
    strange sensation. I knew the man by name, and partly recognized
    his features, but there all resemblance ended. From a trembling,
    despairing, nervous wreck, had emerged a man brimming over with
    self-reliance and contentment.  I talked with him for some time,
    but was not able to bring myself to feel that I had known him
    before.

    To me he was a stranger, and so he left me. A long time has passed
    with no return to hiding, isolating, and compulsive underearning.

    When I need a mental uplift, I often think of another case brought
    in by a physician prominent in New York.  The patient had made his
    own diagnosis, and deciding his situation hopeless, had hidden in
    a deserted barn determined to die. He was rescued by a searching
    party, and, in desperate condition, brought to me. Following his
    physical rehabilitation, he had a talk with me in which he frankly
    stated he thought the treatment a waste of effort, unless I could
    assure him, which no one ever had, that in the future he would
    have the “will power“ to resist the impulse to underearn.

    His underearning problem was so complex, and his depression so
    great, that we felt his only hope would be through what we then
    called “moral psychology,“ and we doubted if even that would have
    any effect.

    However, he did become “sold“ on the ideas contained in this
    book. He has not underearned for a great many years.  I see him
    now and then and he is as fine a specimen of manhood as one could
    wish to meet.

    I earnestly advise every underearner to read this book through,
    and though perhaps he came to scoff, he may remain to pray.
