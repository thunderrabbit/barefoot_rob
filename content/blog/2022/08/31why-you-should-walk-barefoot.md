I declare walking barefoot is a starting point.

It’s one of many starting points on the journey to self discovery.
Who are you?  Why are you here (on earth)?

For most people, wearing shoes has become the norm.  Taking off the
shoes allows one to experience a whole lot of sensations!
Per area, there are
[more nerve endings on our feet than on our hands](https://www.simardfootclinic.com/feet-facts).


Hundreds of people have joined my barefoot walks.  For those who
have forgotten what barefooting is like, taking off their shoes
outside results in a lot of  <em>Wow! There's so many sensations!</em>

Then after the mind calms down a bit, we can remember
"oh that's right! I have feet!"  Then expand our awareness: "oh yes I
have a body!"

Then go a bit more subtle from the physical body: wow not just
physical sensations, I have emotions!  Then, ooh emotions!  How do I
deal with them?

Then we learn a bit and discover emotions are like a guidance
system for living.  They help us navigate the world when used
properly.

Feel angry?  set a boundary.

Feel sad?  it’s time to grieve.

Feel guilt? it’s time to apologize.

Feel fear? time to dive in deeper into the
emotions.  
Is it fear based on a real external thing?  get more info
or run away!
Is it fear based on an old story?  Is it mixed with
excitement?  You might just be onto the next best thing in your life.
Go for it!  (See Pressfield's book Do The Work)

## PART 2:

### but wait, there's more!

Awareness of our body and emotions is nice, but what about just using
our body the way it’s designed?

Humans have taken to standing, so we need to
balance.  Your feet are a big part of that.

Do you cover your eyes to
read?  Why cover your feet to balance?  Allowing your feet to give
your brain info about balance is great.



Allowing your feet to
actively maintain your balance is even better.

Set your toes free!  Let them
wiggle and explore the world.  Let them do their job of telling you
where you are and how you’re standing.

That way they grow strong and keep you living longer.

Seriously.

People who can balance
on one foot for more than ten seconds LIVE LONGER.

What?

Yeah when you’re 80 years old, lose your balance and fall over, you
might die right there, or at least probably going to break a bone,
which tends to break the spirit being held up in bed with busted hip
or whatever.

Simple solution: take off your shoes now!  Allow your toes to actively
balance!

Start wiggling those toes.  Like building muscles, strength improves
over time.

Can you play rock paper scissors with your feet?  It’s not just a
funny game; it can help you live longer!
