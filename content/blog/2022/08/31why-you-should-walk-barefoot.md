Walking barefoot is just a starting point.  It’s one of many starting
points on the journey to self discovery.  Who are you?  Why are you
here (on earth)?

The idea is that (for most people), wearing shoes has become the norm.
Taking off the shoes allows one to experience a whole lot of
sensations!  There are as many nerve endings on our feet as on our
hands.  So it’s like Wow! Sensations! and then when the mind calms
down a bit, we can say wow sensations; I have feet!  Then wow
sensations; I have a body!  Then go a bit more subtle: wow sensations,
I have emotions! (See our group All Things Emotion).  Then, ooh
emotions!  How do I deal with them?

then we go a bit more subtle and discover emotions are like a life
guidance system.  They help us navigate the world when used properly.
Feel angry?  set a boundary.  Feel sad?  it’s time to grieve.  Feel
guilt?  it’s time to apologize.  Feel fear? time to dive in deeper
into the emotions.  Is it fear based on a real external thing?  get
more info or gtfo.  Is it fear based on an old story?  Is it mixed
with excitement?  You might just be onto the next best thing in your
life.  Go for it!

Awareness of our body and emotions is nice, but what about just using
our body the way it’s designed?

Stop cramming your feet into shoes!  Set your toes free!  Let them
wiggle and explore the world.  Let them do their job of telling you
where you are and how you’re standing.  Yes, standing, we need to
balance.  Your feet are a big part of that.  Do you cover your eyes to
read?  Why cover your feet to balance?  Allowing your feet to give
your brain info about balance is great.  Allowing your feet to
actively maintain your balance is even better.  That way they grow
strong and keep you living longer.  Seriously.  People who can balance
on one foot for more than ten seconds LIVE LONGER.  What?  Yeah if
you’re 80, lose your balance and fall over, you might die right there,
or at least probably going to break a bone, which tends to break the
spirit being held up in bed with busted hip or whatever.  Simple
solution: take off your shoes!  Balance!  Get them big toes wiggling.
Can you play rock paper scissors with your feet?  It’s not just a
funny game; it’s a way of living longer!
