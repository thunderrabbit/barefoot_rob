Hello You!

Just a moment ago I had another amazing synchronicity just after doing
morning prayers.

A couple years ago, I bought padded foam flooring to put around my
desk area, ostensibly to protect the wooden floor, but also to catch
my computer mouse when it falls.  (It's a Bluetooth trackball mouse so
when it falls, the ball rolls across the floor to a far corner while
the battery and battery cover each go their own direction, leaving me
crawling under my desk to retrieve the pieces.)  The padding was
supposed to keep the mouse from causing such a commotion, interrupting
my flow, etc.

The padding never worked.  I cannot remember a time it actually kept
the mouse from hitting the floor and doing its part of increasing
entropy in the world.

Just a moment ago, after doing my morning prayers, I hit upon the idea
of putting the single remaining piece of padding where I can stand on
it while praying.  In doing so, I bumped the mouse from its perch and
it landed right on the padding.  The ball fell out but stayed right
there.  The battery even stayed in its case.

Wow.  That's the first time that's happened!  I guess God approves of
me staying in touch more frequently.  It was like the universe said
"Yes, I encourage prayer."

Over the past few weeks I have been showering the universe with
gratitudes and receiving a [shower of
synchronicities](https://www.robnugen.com/journal/2022/06/16/synchronicity-city/)
in reply.

I'll keep it short for now; I plan to stay in touch more frequently (weekly!?).

   blessings
