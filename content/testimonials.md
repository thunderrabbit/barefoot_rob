This circle is for anybody who want to share deep emotional things with like-minded people.

Sometimes in the city life, we feel shame in sharing our truest emotion. However, I love how in this space, rob creates safe space for people to explore their genuine emotion.

In this space, we also listen to other peopleâ€™s emotion and what they are going through.

Through this, I felt I am not alone and I liked how everyone was confronting themselves even if the topic can be challenging!

I recommend to anybody who want to connect and really explore their emotion and what they are going through with people!

Rob has experience in giving space like this so I felt secure and safe to be guided. I like how he also let other people who are experienced to guide as well. He creates a space where every one is involved and feel safe to connect with their own selves!
