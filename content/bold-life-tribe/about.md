## The Jungian Archetypes ##

Bold Life Tribe draws on the energies found in the Jungian
archetypes. These are sensible and practical. They are universally
shared ideas, symbols, and energies. When you make an important
decision, you exercise careful thought and wisdom (Sovereign energy). When
protecting your family from harm, your energy would be sharp, focused,
and fierce (Warrior energy). It’s that simple. The key is knowing
which kind of energy to bring to which situation.
