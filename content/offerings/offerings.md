Rob has been an enormous blessing in my life. His facilitation work, guidance,
and leadership have helped me to sense, understand, express and process my own
emotions. He treats each person as a true individual and listens with openness,
care, and compassion. In my personal experience Rob is excellent at both
counseling and facilitation. He can serve a wide range of clients because he
doesnâ€™t have his own agenda, and pays close attention to the subjective and
personal aspects of oneâ€™s emotions, life circumstances, and individual values,
goals, or priorities. Whether you are struggling with overwhelming emotions,
seeking greater self understanding, or simply desire more clarity about the
direction you want to go in life, Rob can provide the space, tools, and support
for you to discover your own wisdom.

Rob,

Last week in our breakout room with the Inspiration Process, you worked with me where I was the participant.
I know that you did not follow the script but, whatever you did, it has given me a lasting vision of where
I need to be in terms of getting closer to being in the lover quadrant.  I canâ€™t tell you what you did,
it is simply that I now have a much more relaxed view of how a lover looks at the world and how
I would like to see it, more than just occasionally.

Iâ€™m not a strong script follower but I also realize that the script works and can be relied upon to get somewhere.
However, I am also a strong proponent of following wherever the participant wants to take me provided we all have the time.
I felt that you were by my side asking me questions that I understood and, therefore, you were indirectly
forming the vision that I still see today.  It is all very positive for me and you should know that.
That night you had a touch of magic.

I strongly urge you to stick with your counseling vision.  It worksâ€¦â€¦

Bob Mayhew
