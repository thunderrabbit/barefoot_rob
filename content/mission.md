## Mission

Our mission is to give people the tools to live *their own* mission in life.  

Each person's mission comes from that individual's heart.
Only you know what it is, even if you do not realize it.
We have the tools to help discover and uncover that mission, whatever it may be.
We help keep people accountable while focusing their mission.
Sometimes the going gets tough and staying on track with your mission becomes quite challenging.
We keep you focused on your mission, your heart's desire.
