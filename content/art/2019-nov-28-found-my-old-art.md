## Inner Space Set

https://art.robnugen.com/iss09

These are colorized versions of 10,000x zoom electron microscope scans of a space from the back of my brain.

This is my first "set" of pieces, drawn for my second art show (14,15 March 2009) at ELF in Tachikawa. Each piece is 12cm by 13.6cm. (4.7 x 5.3 inches)

These are the first to have http://robnugen.com/art written on the back, which has a link to the art section of my wiki.

## background

(written 09:08 Thursday 28 November 2019 JST)

I found my old art in a box in my closet.  I knew it was there, but I
had forgotten what size some of the pieces where.  (many of them had
become larger in my memory and were so small when I pulled them out of
the box!)

### Well, what is "old" exactly?

I found some pieces that are labeled with robnugen.com/art:

Inner Space Set, with 6 pieces.  They are all 12cm by 13.6cm.  (4.7 x
5.3 inches)

I am sure I have scanned them before, but if I cannot find the
pictures quickly at https://art.robnugen.com/art, I will scan them again now.

Ah yes,
