I found my old art in a box in my closet.  I knew it was there, but I
had forgotten what size some of the pieces where.  (many of them had
become larger in my memory and were so small when I pulled them out of
the box!)

### Well, what is "old" exactly?

I found some pieces that are labeled with robnugen.com/art:

Inner Space Set, with 6 pieces.  They are all 12cm by 13.6cm.  (4.7 x
5.3 inches)

I am sure I have scanned them before, but if I cannot find the
pictures quickly at https://art.robnugen.com/art, I will scan them again now.

Ah yes,
[Inner Space Set of Six - 11 March 2009](https://wiki.robnugen.com/wiki/Art:Inner_Space_Set_of_Six_-_11_March_2009)
and they have a shortlink on art.robnugen.com
