Well, by the time you can read this online, it will be fixed (unless
you are reading a git repo!), but at the moment, my journal (up to 11
Sep) and Blog (up to 29 Aug) are only online because my setup does not
overwrite all the existing files after Hugo makes the site.

I guess I need to read the docs again.

Okay the best I have figured out so far is that if I put _index.md
files in the subdirectories of my journal/yyyy/mm directories, those
entries show up.

But it was working before without those _index.md files littered
everywhere.  What changed??
