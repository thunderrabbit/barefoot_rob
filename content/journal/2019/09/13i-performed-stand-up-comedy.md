(adapted from my note last night to Mark)

I went to a stand-up comedy open mic tonight and ended up doing a set
(my first ever!)

Several jokes went well, a couple did not; one of those is not
recoverable in any way I can think of.

Soness said it was really good that I used contents of the room for
several of my bits.
