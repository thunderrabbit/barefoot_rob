Hello

I have a rather large Hugo site which I have pared down into one bite sized repository.

I made some tweaks to the top page to only show Page type Blog (in content and in pagination)

There are also page type. journal which I would like to be displayed under /journal

This all worked a few versions of Hugo ago.

I upgraded Hugo to 0.58 recently and it stopped working.

Neither /blog nor /journal nor the top page show any content.

I think it just be related to ______
which says we have to use A instead of B.  I tried that but still no content was displayed.
