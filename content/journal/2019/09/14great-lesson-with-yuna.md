Today I was five minutes late to (teach) my lesson with Yuna; I
excitedly told her about going to see
[叶結（Kanauknot)](https://www.facebook.com/叶結
Kanauknot-2016891955206776/) today in 豊島園after having seen them in
ぐりんぱ.

I was so excited that I explained "hh hh hh hh hh", from
[The Castle of Dreams](https://thunderrabbit.com/castle/Dragon_run-way)

I was so excited that for 30 minutes, this overshadowed my news about
having done my first stand up comedy last night after being invited by
Soness.

After talking about how Soness has been a great friend for years,
working as a performer (for English Carnival), speaker coach (for
various TED and TED-style events), and now beginning to explore stand
up comedy as a hobby, Yuna began to think about what it might be like
to have a hobby that could become a job.

I saw this in her expression and was like, "I think you are thinking
about how you can make your hobby into a career" and quickly rattled
off three ways I thought reading books could become a career.

* publisher
* editor
* audio book voice

I was  surprised to hear Yuna  had heard that one  "cannot enjoy their
job"  or something.   I  thought  *Oh man  that  sounds like  terrible
advice!!!* and said "well, I believe otherwise.."

In the end, I used the question
[Rin](https://www.facebook.com/niyaa.rn) gave me and invited Yuna to
think about what workshop she would *love* to present for people.  I
offered that it would likely fit well with Giselle's
[English&amp;Coffee + More!!](https://www.meetup.com/English-coffee-more/)
meetup group.

Next lesson next week, much more space for Yuna to speak!
