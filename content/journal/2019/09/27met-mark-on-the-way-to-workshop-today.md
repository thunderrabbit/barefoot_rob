Mark synchronistically got on the same train car as me and we had a
great quick check-in.  I was able to dump everything about work and
computer things going unexpectedly, and he told me about a cool set of
questions he found that may work well in our
[men's circle](https://www.mkpjapan.org).

We did not have long to hang out so just quick stories and then long
wave bye as we had to go on separate trains in 代々木上原 station.
