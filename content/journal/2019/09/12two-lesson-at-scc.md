Had an hour lesson with Liliko, during which we double checked the
English for an AI game they are developing.  For some reason they keep
asking for confirmation of stuff on paper but it has gotten to the
point that we would prefer to see the real thing in action in order to
really make sure it's all correct.

Also had a lesson with Azusa, during which we clarified some of her
translation into English, changing the word "become" into "because"
and stuff like replacing "addition and multiplication are done by
turning the handle outside" with "to add and multiply numbers, we turn
the handle clockwise," partially because she could not consistently
say "multiplication."

It reminds me of the time I was out of time to do my speech in
Japanese, and just read it off the page instead of knowing what I was
saying.

Today might be the last day I can shop at the nearby shop; their last
day is Monday the 23rd.  I may come back on that day to see if prices
are slashed or what.
