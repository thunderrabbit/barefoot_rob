Had a great day yesterday at Yomiuriland with Bu and Yen.  We
pretty much rode everything, and I tried quite hard to ride without
shoes on anything, but was pretty much requested to put on shoes every
time.  I think I made it onto one ride (a kiddy ride) without shoes.
Oh and maybe the ferris wheel?

I did a little skit of Francois driving a gocart.

We also did the car making thing.

We did the spinning-till-ya-throwup teacups, spinning as fast as we
could.  That was great; I had not done that in a while!  Bu and I
did the bungee, but Yen was like "yeah nah.  I'll take video of you
guys!"

I recognized Kakashi, the juggler who I met at Grinpa, and got a
picture with him!

He did a crazy balancing thing I should have taken a photo of *that*.

We colored the tops of UFO ramen, which is great for taking back home,
but *we cannot eat the ramen* in the shop.

Bu and Yen bounced at 5pm and I stayed and went back to ride Crazy Hyuuuu
and Crazy Stoonn, and chatted with some peeps effectively enough that
they asked to get a picture with me.

Then saw Sami and Wilson who we had seen before but didn't talk to.  I
invited them to do the water raft slide thing; they enjoyed it enough
we rode twice!  Got a pic with them and exchanged info so we can keep
in touch!
