Today is the second time for me to lead an eye gazing workshop.  This
will be in the same location in Dogenzaka.

It will be my first time to meet Yuna face to face!  We have been
doing lessons online for a while (since July 2018), so we know each
other pretty well, but we have never met!

Currently 4 people are scheduled to attend, which is better than the
Past Lives workshop!  I apparently need to do a better job promoting
next time. :-)
