Usually Lin checks in with me on her way home, but she has not checked
in with me yet.  I wrote this to Mark on LINE:

    23:00 barefoot Rob Nugen Just checking in now; Lin is not home and not answering her phone or LINE
    23:01 barefoot Rob Nugen It's possible she is out with friends, but usually she tells me if she will be late
    23:01 barefoot Rob Nugen I won't seriously worry until after last train
    23:02 barefoot Rob Nugen I do not need any support now, but I will let you know if I do.
    23:02 barefoot Rob Nugen I assume she will come home, so from your point of view please treat this as
	                         no news is good news.  i.e no further updates from me means she came home fine.

She called me; she is fine, just was out with co-workers due to
someone's last day at work.
