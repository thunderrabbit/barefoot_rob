Moe Joe.  AB server ELB is causing or revealing 502s.  Locally, I
rebooted my elderly Macbook and the USB cable is still not working.  I
reset the printer system and the printer still will not print.  I
tried to copy a document and the printer would not copy it.  And
latest version of Hugo is *not* creating my website subdirectories
(/journal or /blog).

(My printer's scan-to-server function is working, though.  yay!!)
