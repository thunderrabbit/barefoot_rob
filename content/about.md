## About

I conduct workshops and meetings aimed at connecting people to themselves and others.

For the past four years, I have been running a men’s peer counseling group in Tokyo. I have also been conducting barefoot walking and eye gazing workshops in both Tokyo and Kanagawa. I am also currently training towards certification in shadow work. This process aims to put people more in touch with the more difficult aspects of themselves.

As a 16-year resident in Kanagawa, I am fully aware of both the joys and pitfalls of life in Japan. In the rut of work, relationships, and other commitments, it is easy to feel cut off, isolated, and eager find something more meaningful.

My experience in counseling and facilitation work includes:

* 10+ years attending and 4+ years leading a weekly peer counseling circle for men
* 1+ year’s experience suicide hotline volunteer
* 16+ years barefoot walking in Houston Texas and Tokyo Japan
* Several weekends Shamanic healing trainings
* 8 days ShadowWork basic training

**Awaken your Sole**

Going barefoot is something of a novelty in Japan. People who have seldom or never gone barefoot outside need to overcome many challenges. Yes, it can be a bit painful at first if you don’t know what to look for. But I will make sure that your introduction to barefoot walking is a gentle and enjoyable one. Barefoot walking is freedom. The sensations you feel make you more aware of where you are, and who you are. Learn more here

**An eye for an eye**

Eye-gazing may seem unusual. But this simple activity, which involves trust and vulnerability can offer profound awakenings and connections. Learn more here

**Your trusted guide**

You need a competent and trusted guide. Leading my Peer counseling circles has given me vast experience in navigating this territory.  Do you need someone to hear you?  I can be that person.  Need someone to represent the energy of your father, your mother, your boss, your brother, sister, or your employee?  I can be that person. I can ask you the questions that will help you see the way forward.

My workshops will let you explore what blocks you from offering the best of yourself to the world. We will work through the emotions and allow your inner guidance to shine through.
