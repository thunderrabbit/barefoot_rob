Author of <a href="https://booklink.shop/B0FYQ3RHCV">I'M FINE!: A Practical Guide To Managing Your Emotions To Strengthen Relationships With Loved Ones And Yourself</a>

<a href="https://booklink.shop/B0FYQ3RHCV"><img src="https://b.robnugen.com/blog/2024/thumbs/im_fine_red_lower_1000.jpeg" alt="I'M FINE! book cover" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; max-width: 300px;"></a>

This book is for ambitious men who know they can handle the pressure, but are starting to realize that keeping it all together takes more than just grinding harder.

This book is for men like me, who’ve always wanted to do the right thing, but haven’t had the support, space, or language to actually deal with it. You don’t have to do it alone. Let’s walk this path together.

## Testimonials


<div class="walk-segment">
I met Rob within a business setting and we set a little group up to be
accountability buddies. During our group meetings I have gotten to know
Rob well and have been continuously impressed by his clear presence,
skills and generosity.

Recently, I was struggling with a mental blockage and Rob offered to guide me
through a process to explore and resolve the blockage. Rob's thoughtful and
intuitive approach, combined with his grounding energy and gentle commitment
to helping others to heal was super helpful in releasing the old pattern.

Anyone, who feels stuck and wants a helping hand or maybe just needs to be
listened, would find a session with Rob beneficial. I highly recommend Rob!

This circle is for anybody who want to share deep emotional things with like-minded people.

Sometimes in the city life, we feel shame in sharing our truest emotion. However,
I love how in this space, Rob creates safe space for people to explore their genuine emotion.

In this space, we also listen to other people’s emotion and what they are going through.

Through this, I felt I am not alone and I liked how everyone was confronting themselves even if the topic can be challenging!

I recommend to anybody who want to connect and really explore their emotion and what they are going through with people!

Rob has experience in giving space like this so I felt secure and safe to be guided. I like how he also let other people who are experienced to guide as well. He creates a space where every one is involved and feel safe to connect with their own selves!

<div class="walk-segment">
There are some moments in life that are so hard to (live in) and
navigate. Recently I have been through a fair share of those moments.

The stress and confusion that those moments cause me stops / has been
stopping me from taking action and from any attempts of problem
solving. It may sound like a cliche, but the reality is that it makes
me stuck.

Rob's patience and attentive listening creates a safe space for me
to open up and helped me to gain insight into the "tangled mess"
of my feelings.

Patiently guiding me through, peeling layer by layer, Rob helped me to
focus on myself and my feelings, and to create more clarity about how
the life stresses had affected me.

Rob created a safe and open space where I could talk through some
overwhelming feelings, which are difficult to talk about, or even to
think about, in a daily life.

I would recommend Rob to anyone who is willing to open up about their
struggles, and who is open to receive gentle support to untangle
emotional messes that are caused by living this thing called LIFE.
