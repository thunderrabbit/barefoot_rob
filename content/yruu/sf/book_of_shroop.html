<h1>Shroop 1:1 - 1:10</h1>

<p>In the beginning the Universe was without form, and void; and the
spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.  And in the beginning
was the football; and the football was with god; and the football was
God.</p>

<p>And on the First Day, God said, Let there be Fwap: and there was
Fwap; and God divided the Fwap from the Fwizap.  And on the Second Day
God created the Zoom and the Froom. And on the Third Day God created
the Shrug and the Frug.  And on the Fourth Day God created the Shrotum
and the Frotum.  And on the Fifth Day god created the Tattle, and the
Penance Point.  And on the Sixth Day God create Mr Dictator in His own
image; in the image of God created He him.</p>

<p>And God said unto him, Be dictatorial, and dictate, and give
dictation to the Universe, and subdue it, and have dominion over the
members thereof, and over nonexistent creatures, and over every living
thing that moveth upon the earth.</p>
