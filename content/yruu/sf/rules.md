## Shroop 1:1 - 1:10

In the beginning the Universe was without form, and void; and the
spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.  And God said, Let
there by silence: and there was silence.  And God heard the silence,
that it was good: and God divided the silence from the football.  And
God called the silence Silent and the football he called Football.

And God said, Let there be form in the midst of the silence, and let
it be silent within the silence.  And God made the form, and divided
the universe which existed in the form from the non-existant universe
which did not exist in any form.

And God said, Let there be motion in the form, and let the Football move within the form: and it was so.


And God said, Let us make Mr Dictator in our image, after our
likeness: and let them have dominion over the form.  And God said unto
him, Be dictatorial, and dictate, and give dictation to the Universe,
and subdue it, and have dominion over the members thereof, and over
nonexistent creatures, and over every living thing that moveth upon
the form.

And God said unto him, Behold, I have given you every rule bearing
merit, which is upon the form of all the universe, and all the motion
of the Football.

And the LORD God commanded the dictator, saying, Of every rule thou
may freely speak, but thou shall not expose any rule into the written
word.
