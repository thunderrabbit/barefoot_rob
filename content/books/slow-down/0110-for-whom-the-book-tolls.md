## Who this book is for

In a real sense, this book is for me and people like me.  If you have
been around for a bit, got some experience and such for others to
hear, let this book be a reminder that you have enough to write a
book.  I am literally just littering the page with a bunch of old
stuff I heard or words I know and somehow gonna shape it all together,
invisible to most people, but in visible show for those who know where
to look.  The first version of this text is and so long as GitHub
exists, will be available at

https://github.com/thunderrabbit/barefoot_rob/commit/119599158840936cd9910f9945eea9def0bb710a

And by the nature of how git works, you can see every time I saved changes.

Okay anyway, Mel Ashe suggested "Start Your Own Religion" so I created
R.O.B.O.T. an acronym for Rob's Own Brand Of Thinking, and you're only
allowed to join if you share my name, birthdate, and birth city.

So I am suggesting you write your own book.  If you have a book in
you, write it! Stop reading this one.

This book is for people who want to hear that little voice in their
head saying "you can do it," for, you can do it.

Even if you have to do butterfly in diving bell style write with
glances, or with morse code twitches, do it.  That your book wants to
come out is proof someone wants to read it.  And as I am writing this
utter garbage now, which I presume will get cleaned up, I am getting
to the good stuff.

Just write.

I thought I was writing about who the book is for, not how to write a book!

I need to Slow Down.
