## Who this book is for

In a real sense, this book is for me and people like me.  If you have
been around for a bit, got some experience and such for others to
hear, let this book be a reminder that you have enough to write a
book.  I am literally just littering the page with a bunch of old
stuff I heard or words I know and somehow gonna shape it all together,
invisible to most people, but in visible show for those who know where
to look.  The first version of this text is and so long as GitHub
exists, will be available at

https://github.com/thunderrabbit/barefoot_rob/commit/119599158840936cd9910f9945eea9def0bb710a

And by the nature of how git works, you can see every time I saved changes.

Okay anyway, Mel Ashe suggested "Start Your Own Religion" so I created
R.O.B.O.T. an acronym for Rob's Own Brand Of Thinking, and you're only
allowed to join if you share my name, birthdate, and birth city.

So I am suggesting you write your own book.  If you have a book in
you, write it! Stop reading this one.

This book is for people who want to hear that little voice in their
head saying "you can do it," for, you can do it.

Even if you have to do butterfly in diving bell style write with
glances, or with morse code twitches, do it.  That your book wants to
come out is proof someone wants to read it.  And as I am writing this
utter garbage now, which I presume will get cleaned up, I am getting
to the good stuff.

Just write.

I thought I was writing about who the book is for, not how to write a book!

I need to Slow Down.

(five minutes please)

This book is for those who have too many projects, too much going on,
too many fucking things scratching at the eyes of attention, trying to
get the precious nectar of time.

Time
does
not
work
the
way
we
think.

Time transcends time.  When I smoked pot, time slowed wayyy the fuck
down.  When I ate 7 pot brownies, time flowed backwards.  In
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, time just is, and can be perceived
in any direction or orientation.

I love playing with time.  My friend Kyoko routinely goes for 10 day
meditation retreats (Vipassana).  Right now she is on a 40 day
retreat.  Last time we talked she mentioned that now she consciously
plays with time during her meditations.  A second can feel like an
hour and an hour can feel like a second.

I don't know what all this means except that western science doesn't
know wtf time is.  We don't even know what gravity is, really.

Oh, so I love playing with time.  I am making a stop motion animation
of characters making a rolling ball track.

Just now I glued another piece onto the sample Outer Spiral.  I took a
picture of it and four months later posted on the page https://www.marbletrack3.com/p/os

Thank you!
