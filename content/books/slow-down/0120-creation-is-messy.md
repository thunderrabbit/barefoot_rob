## Creation is messy

It's easy to be happy when things are going well

It's also ready to get bored and complacent, complain, and fall off the happy vibes.

Happy Birthday to you, age 26 is the perfect time to switch back to celebrate days.

Hold up. I'm an adult, but I don't feel like an adult.  I feel young but I'm in an old body.

Navel gazing is the perfect way to realize something is wrong.  Or fall into a hole and not realize we can do anything about it.

After a certain age, if you don't care about yourself, no one else will.  Everyone is too busy worrying about themselves.

Thing is: there is no self in the individual sense.

If you are in a situation where you can afford to pick up this book and have a read, you have time to focus on your focus.  Where are you spending your energy?  That's where you will find yourself.

Creation is messy beautiful R and D for the individual.

What is art?  A copy of a copy of is not born of inner inspiration.  You have to take a moment to peek inside, nay to feel inside.  All that stuff that feels messy includes the good stuff. Thing is, it's difficult to distinguish what's good in terms of what will move you toward the way you want to go and what will not.

Focus on creativity 80% of the time and feel lucky if you get to create 50% of the time.

Not "stamp widgets" create, create: hearing inside and putting pen to paper or steps to dance or fingers to strings.  Yes, you were hurt by doing it before.  Yes, keep going.  You will get hurt again. Keep going.

The thread of creativity used to be seen as an entity.  I read that in Eat Pray Love.  Author Elizabeth Gilbert apparently took a leap and the universe caught her.  Where is she now? I don't know. Is she leaping faithfully again?  I hope so.  It doesn't have to be in a public way, but in a you way.  Unique to your predilections. God manifest through you.  God dwells in you as you.  God dwells in me as me.

We can choose at any given moment how to focus.  Focus on X and get more X.  This is really how I saw it works.

The dog is not in on it.

marijuana makes you produce from the heart because it puts the present moment in full detail.  Time stands still like a roller coaster coming to a full stop before you get back into the station to get outl. Just like shhhzzzzzzzzxxx.  Silence.  Wow what happened? Where am I now?

I fell into a hole for a while, approximately infinity lifetimes until the dog came up to me, living in the moment and offering some licks.

---------

Choosing an optimal action in each moment seems like the best way to go and there are multiple optimal options at any given point. The thing is that all options are optimal for the universe and some options give us different experiences and we can choose our experience based on the options that we choose or choose our experience with the options that we choose and they're all equally good in the eyes of the universe because we learn something and any case ignoring karma we don't affect the universe directly. It just adds to our karma and that's fine.

### IMPACT

On 30 August 2022, around 6:51 in the morning, I wrote to my friend, _____.

    Good morning _____!
    On May 11th of this year I discovered an organization called underearners anonymous
    It's a 12-step program for people who are addicted to under-earning and under-being
    When reading through their symptoms I thought "oh wow that's me" for a lot of them.
    The solution to all of my woes is to put my life into the hands of higher power.

    ((etc etc more normal conversation))

_____ replied a few days later:

    Hey Rob,

    It's good to hear from you.  Your message is just slightly weird,
    like it's trying to sell me something, but then it really sounds
    like Rob, so I guess your account has NOT been hacked.

    As you know, I am VERY direct and straight.  I was pissed that I
    contributed to your walk and you were meant to send me a postcard
    or something, but you did not keep to your side of the deal.

    Basic ethics, and keeping promises is VERY important.  It's not
    cool or interesting, but it's the foundation for all (any) of the
    funky stuff.

    Feel free to call me on Whatsapp or on FB Messenger.  Please call
    me mornings, as I work hard and I get very tired.

    Love to you and Lin.

Oh shit.  I fucked that up didn't I?
See, _____ had sent me $100 for my book, so I wrote their name on the list for my book, (not a postcard.)
The book is still under construction.

I took on a larger project than I knew how to handle.
It's been over a year.

Thank You, higher power, for the kick in the ass!
