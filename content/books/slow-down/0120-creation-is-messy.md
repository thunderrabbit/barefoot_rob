## Creation is messy

It's easy to be happy when things are going well

It's also ready to get bored and complacent, complain, and fall off the happy vibes.

Happy Birthday to you, age 26 is the perfect time to switch back to celebrate days.

Hold up. I'm an adult, but I don't feel like an adult.  I feel young but I'm in an old body.

Navel gazing is the perfect way to realize something is wrong.  Or fall into a hole and not realize we can do anything about it.

After a certain age, if you don't care about yourself, no one else will.  Everyone is too busy worrying about themselves.

Thing is: there is no self in the individual sense.

If you are in a situation where you can afford to pick up this book and have a read, you have time to focus on your focus.  Where are you spending your energy?  That's where you will find yourself.

Creation is messy beautiful R and D for the individual.

What is art?  A copy of a copy of is not born of inner inspiration.  You have to take a moment to peek inside, nay to feel inside.  All that stuff that feels messy includes the good stuff. Thing is, it's difficult to distinguish what's good in terms of what will move you toward the way you want to go and what will not.

Focus on creativity 80% of the time and feel lucky if you get to create 50% of the time.

Not "stamp widgets" create, create: hearing inside and putting pen to paper or steps to dance or fingers to strings.  Yes, you were hurt by doing it before.  Yes, keep going.  You will get hurt again. Keep going.

The thread of creativity used to be seen as an entity.  I read that in Eat Pray Love.  Author Elizabeth Gilbert apparently took a leap and the universe caught her.  Where is she now? I don't know. Is she leaping faithfully again?  I hope so.  It doesn't have to be in a public way, but in a you way.  Unique to your predilections. God manifest through you.  God dwells in you as you.  God dwells in me as me.

We can choose at any given moment how to focus.  Focus on X and get more X.  This is really how I saw it works.

The dog is not in on it.

marijuana makes you produce from the heart because it puts the present moment in full detail.  Time stands still like a roller coaster coming to a full stop before you get back into the station to get outl. Just like shhhzzzzzzzzxxx.  Silence.  Wow what happened? Where am I now?

I fell into a hole for a while, approximately infinity lifetimes until the dog came up to me, living in the moment and offering some licks.

Choosing an optimal action in each moment seems like the best way to go and there are multiple optimal options at any given point. The thing is that all options are optimal for the universe and some options give us different experiences and we can choose our experience based on the options that we choose or choose our experience with the options that we choose and they're all equally good in the eyes of the universe because we learn something and any case ignoring karma we don't affect the universe directly. It just adds to our karma and that's fine.
