One of my friends said God couldn't have a personal interest in each
of us.

I countered this claim by talking about integers versus the
reals. There are a finite number of humans on the planet and ever in
existence. However, the real numbers are infinitely greater than each
and every integer.

If God is infinite, God's not going to be the infinity of the Aleph Null
integers. God's going to be infinite like Aleph infinity infinity
infinities plus one of any infinity that humans could ever imagine,
much less articulate.

My friend is a mathematician. So he understood this description
probably better than I do, and said it gave him something to think
about.

In my mind, it is a simple proof that God, of course, can pay attention
to each of us uniquely separately individually. Not like the small
number of relationships that a human can form but a literal, infinite
number of relationships, each in full Technicolor and care and
attention

In addition to this, God
can trivially have an infinite number of relationships per person,
which has led me to addressing God as both daddy and mommy and brother
and friend, and employer and mentor and allowing me to sink into all
of these relationships, whether they be played out via humans, or
played out in my heart.

They've been helping me stay more focused on
moving in the right way. The most amazing thing for all of these is
this sense of gratitude, which I'm still kind of playing with to see
what it is or what it means, but somehow, gratitude seems to make
things better. That's as simply as I can articulate it at this
point. It's like the, you know, early days of discovering magnetism or
something. It's like "wow metal things are attracted to this lodestone"
and you know, naming the the rock after the island where they were
first discovered.

Now it's like, "huh joy in my life is attracted to gratitude."
I recently had some experiences, a few synchronicities in a
row related to my friend Jess who lives in Bondi Beach.
When thinking of calling her, I looked up
and saw Bondis Ocean Club cafe. And this cafe is near my
station. But I had never seen it before.

Now, granted, I didn't walk
this particular route very often. I went a long way so I could have
more privacy during another phone call. And yet, it's just an amazing,
interesting synchronicity. And I guarantee that I thought about
calling Jess first before I saw the thing, and there's been
lots of physics, in science and different, whatever's saying that time
isn't what we think it is. And space isn't what we think it is and all
this stuff.

So I'm just kind of like, poking at the edges of what
anything might possibly be. And just seems the gratitude makes a
difference in the physical world. The This has nothing to do with the
synchronicity story, but like having the synchronicity I remind myself
to have gratitude. And it's just such an interesting cool thing. So I
had this phone call with Jess in Bondi
Beach and then later while having a
conversation about her, she texted me. And I was like, oh, that's also
pretty cool. Now, granted, it's not doesn't mean anything. In
particular, we had just been texting that days. So the odds are pretty
high that we would text again, but it was just at the same time that
actually someone else was talking about her so yeah, really, really
interesting. synchronicities happening.

Is there a way to really tune
in to a higher power at all times? Is that what enlightenment looks
like? Or is that another description of enlightenment to simply be in
tune with spirit all the time I'm just kind of blabbing about it. But
it's just so interesting that my life goes better when I'm feeling
gratitude. And it's easier to feel gratitude when my life goes
better.

And so, taking this to an extreme, so to speak, like this
feeling gratitude about everything I've heard phrases like imagine
everything is happening for me, instead of to me like things are
happening on my behalf including breaking my finger and I'm seeing all
the accidents I've had in my life but like, stitches are on my hands
or face or just whatever. And you're breaking bones. Or my back or my
head and your breakups being broken up by girlfriends or having to the
fights with with my wife just somehow, staying present to this idea
this is happening for me and expressing gratitude for the thing.

Now,
I'm not always able to do that by any stretch, but when I can, it
helps. It helps me stay present. For example, when Lin and I are
having a fight helps me stay present. It helps me be able to recover,
so to speak much more quickly. It helps me be able to stay calm and
have it be able to help her stay calm as well. We went to a therapist
who talked about my tendency to be quiet if I'm under any kind of
duress, and Lin's tendency to go under duress if she's feeling
isolated. So there would be this pattern happening that I would feel
that she's not listening to me or something to that would put me into
a bad state. So I would just shut up and the why would I talk? Why
should I talk if she's not gonna listen? And so then Lin would feel
like I'm running away from her so she would get more anxious and more
talkative and are complaining and you know, and then therefore not
able to hear me. So this is a second little vicious cycle. And having
the awareness of that cycle, helps me a lot in recognizing how to let
go of it.

By not engaging or just be it by being aware. But taking that a step
further. Like having this cycle is for me, it's a gift. It's all for
my benefit that this has been happening in my life. And so I can say,
well, for example, you know, I get to know myself more or I get to
have more joy with Lin, by getting out of that situation more
quickly. And I recognize that that's like saying that having the door
locked allows me to unlock the door, which in itself maybe isn't a
gift but yeah, just this whole kind of sense of gratitude makes a big
difference. Is very intriguing to me like what's the metaphysics of
gratitude? You know, why? Why would that be helpful and the YouTuber,
Teal Swan said something like, "Don't you like it when people express
gratitude to you and it tend to want to do that thing for
them more." She say, well, Spirit is the same way. And it's a funny way
to anthropomorphize God, saying God
is like a person which I just started this whole chapter by saying
God's not like a person but

Imagining that spirit likes to be given gratitude is a good way
to, to think about spirit as a human. How actually correct is that?
What
does it mean? Perhaps it's like, *having gratitude vibrations around me
attracts people who are also in gratitude and therefore more willing
to engage with me in a good way.* That kind of makes sense, you know,
like, law of attraction kind of thing. And yet at the same time, I
don't need to figure it out. I can simply be grateful that I know the
secret so to speak.

I
can just use this knowledge or this this kind of skill, of being
grateful for all the things happening in in my life. continually
asking God to give me guidance and grateful for the guidance or, to me
being grateful for the guidance.  So yeah. Gratitude,
ね。 That's really really interesting.
