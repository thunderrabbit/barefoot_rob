What are fish good at?  Swimming!  Breathing under water!

Do fish *know* they are good at these things?  Do they think about it?
I imagine not; it's just what they do!

What are you good at?  ___________!    __________________!

Do you *know* you are good at these things?  Do you think about it?
I imagine not; it's just what you do!

In fish-world most everyone swims, which is where my analogy breaks down.

In human-world, each person has different innate talents.
I won't claim everyone is in a state to use their talents,
but you're spending time reading this book, so let's explore the idea.

* What types of questions do people generally ask you?
* What problems do people come to you for help?

Exploring these questions for myself, I have learned I'm a good listener.
I'm also grounded, for lack of a better term.

People have described me as "like a tree."

Missy once had a dream where everything was in chaos,
while I was standing in the middle, calmly holding space.

This chapter appeared after
Jeremy Weikel reminded me

    Another take-away from our talk: Keep an eye out for other parts of yourself
    that you consider ordinary, normal, and unremarkable, but that you see other
    people take note of. Hidden superpowers revealed = sacred gifts given to us,
    to use to heal this world.
