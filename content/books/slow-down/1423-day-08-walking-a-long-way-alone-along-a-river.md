This was the morning after the splinter.  I woke up and my foot was still in agony as soon as I touched it to the carpeted floor below my bed.

Fuck this.  I'm going to quit, I told Shraddhan on our morning call.

"The train station is *right there*," I said, looking out the window.
"I recognize those cars.  Those are Tokaido Line cars."
They go directly to Tokyo Station.  "I can be home in about an hour." (*)

"Well, are you sure that's what you want to do?" Shraddhan asked.
"How will you feel when we talk tomorrow morning?"

Silence.

Silence.

"No, that's not what I want to do.  I want to keep going.  Fuckit.  I'll just wear my sandals and it will be fine."

And that's what I did.

Once I got walking, the agonizing pain stopped.
The splinter removal didn't bother me the rest of the trip.

Now that it's 9 months later, I don't recall much else about this day.
Google maps says I walked 23.1km in 6 hours 42 minutes.  Saitama Grand
Hotel Honjo to Hotel Ruka, which I often read as Hotel Ruruka.

Photos show long straight stretches along highways and a river.

(*) It was 本所駅 I could see from Saitama Grand Hotel.  
Apparently would have taken 2.5 hours to get home via train from otherwise
but I was otherwise correct about the train line.

Walking along the river and found this nice sign..

I like noticing how some of the lines on the solar panels line up
all the way across their field

I made it to my hotel last night just after dark, turned off all the lights,
took a bath in complete darkness and fell asleep in the bath, woke up when the
water started getting cold, put ointment on my feet and jumped directly into bed.
