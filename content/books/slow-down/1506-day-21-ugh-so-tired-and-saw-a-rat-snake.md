Saw a [rather large

I encountered [before crossing Kariyata
River (map)](https://goo.gl/maps/gxbDqW39kfjXkgwe8).  He was quite chill.

Rambling transcript of story:

Walking around the bend of a highway where the road was terribly
rough. And I was wearing sandals because it was so rough. Just about
to cross, I couldn't even see the path where I was headed. And is I
was like, I need to, I see the berm of a river. And I need to go over
that hill. But I come in around this corner, I can't see if there is
actually a path there to go from this level around the left up to the
bridge that's crossing the river.

So I might have to go away back or I might have to I'm not going to go
way back. Let me tell you that. But I might have to like drag or pick
up my bag and carry it up this hill. And so just approaching and
approaching and finally at the last minute, it's like okay, there's a
path cool. And getting legs stepping up the path toward the toward the
bridge that was there. over the river. Walking, walking, walking, just
looking at my feet and my Oh, so tired. Hello. Hello snake. You're
beautiful.

Wow. It's like Oh, hi snake. beautiful green rat snake. I didn't know
as a rat snake until after I posted a picture up on Reddit. But the
answer quick and answer quickly came back. No, that's a Japanese rat
snake is a beautiful species but a beautiful specimen. I was able the
rat snake was she was so chill. I was able to put François down in
front of him take a picture. Pick François up start a video and then
the snake was like I guess I guess we're done here snake sorta snake
and on by.

And I like I wanted to pick it up. And thought it would be
more polite to just let it go on its way. And someone said on Reddit
and to say just say pardon me when you pick it up. And I kind of sort
of think that that's right. I mean, if it's an actual in my heart to
excuse me, I would like to pick you up. I wonder if it's okay, but I
just had this, you know, kind of reverence for this animal.

And projecting today that it saw me as a giant animal. It was a big
snake but I'm a lot bigger than that. And on Reddit, the guy was
guessing is two meters long. I guessed it was 130 centimeters
long. But yeah, it's big snake looks pretty cool. In decent size.

So yeah, they're just there was a cool snake and oh, and then my
friend Missy texted me right after that. She's like, Oh, I just had an
amazing experience. And she was telling me about her experience. And
so we decided that the snake was a messenger letting me know to
contact her because she had just had a had an amazing experience. So
that was neat. I put him on YouTube. I called it Missy's green snake.

    title: "Finished Day 21 in record time"


Before I started walking, Jason H described a simple 4 steps to adapting to any stressful situation.  I think I am in the last stage now; I have just come to realize walking is my life.  Nothing can be done to change it.  Just walk walk walk.

I felt quite hot and tired by the end of today.  Not a drop of rain in sight, and plenty of sun, so I am glad I put on sunscreen before I started out at 7am.  I arrived at the hotel about 2:30pm, so 7.5 hours walking 17.5 kilometers (according to Google Maps)

[![2021 may 06 day 21 walk map](//b.robnugen.com/quests/walk-to-niigata/2021/en_route/day-21/thumbs/2021_may_06_day_21_walk_map.png)](//b.robnugen.com/quests/walk-to-niigata/2021/en_route/day-21/2021_may_06_day_21_walk_map.png)
