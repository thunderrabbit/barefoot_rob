I bought _Beyond Dreaming_, and have been slowly going through it.

I woke up during a dream a couple nights ago:

<p class="dream">
I was driving my pickup truck and went into a parking lot, looking for
the source of some good music.  I drove up to another pickup truck,
and parked so they were pointing head to head.  A black man got out of
the other pickup truck and I noticed both trucks were white.  He
silently offered me a drink in an unopened plastic bottle.  I accepted
the bottle and watched him open his bottle, take a drink and then
splash some drink out of the bottle at the ground in front of me.  I
turned around and two more of his friends had arrived, silently
appraising the scene.
</p>

<p class="dream">
I asked if they spoke English and they laughed a little.  One woman
said I should watch myself as they all walked away.
</p>

<p class="dream">
I got back into my pickup truck and backed out of the parking lot,
somehow able to turn around without bumping other cars.  There was a
chain blocking my way out and I realized I could drive slowly through
it because I was in non physical reality(*). I drove toward the chain
then turned left in front of it so as to not break anything.  I drove
into a tunnel underpass and realized it would be faster to fly, so I
went to a restaurant where people were waiting in line and ascended
the stairs and went out a door on the roof of the tower which had a
camera mounted on top to do weather reports.  I went to the edge of
the building in front of the camera and jumped off the building and
flew with the intention of finding the greenery of central Tokyo.  I
woke up while flying and looked at the view on my phone which showed
my body sleeping in front of the camera for the past 10 hours and 312
people viewing the livestream.  I watched myself wake up via the
livestream and walked down into my living room of the house (we lived
in until 1978) thinking wow what a weird dream and then I woke up in
this physical reality, did a dream test to confirm I am in physical
reality, then wrote this.
</p>

(*) While dreaming I often "realize" I can fly or do other things that
would not be possible in physical reality... but don't usually realize
I'm dreaming.

From Gene's book _Beyond Dreaming_:

    The primary purpose of this book is for others
    to learn how to awaken consciousness



From my Book, _SLOW DOWN_

    One of the ways to wake up is to pay attention to little
    details.
