Next destination is essentially straight for 14 km.

Okay it's decided then, we will call it SUPER CENTER PLANT 5. Everyone in agreement?

These doors would have to be paper light for these door stoppers to
have a chance of actually stopping them if they really opened.

Is this a way out outhouse?

[![2021 may 06 looks like an outhouse out in the middle of fields](//b.robnugen.com/quests/walk-to-niigata/2021/en_route/day-22/thumbs/2021_may_06_looks_like_an_outhouse_out_in_the_middle_of_fields.jpeg)](//b.robnugen.com/quests/walk-to-niigata/2021/en_route/day-22/2021_may_06_looks_like_an_outhouse_out_in_the_middle_of_fields.jpeg)

In any case, it's right above the water.

[![2021 may 06 if so it dumps right into the river](//b.robnugen.com/quests/walk-to-niigata/2021/en_route/day-22/thumbs/2021_may_06_if_so_it_dumps_right_into_the_river.jpeg)](//b.robnugen.com/quests/walk-to-niigata/2021/en_route/day-22/2021_may_06_if_so_it_dumps_right_into_the_river.jpeg)

I did a couple of livestreams on Instagram yesterday.  (I
[downloaded](https://ingramer.com/downloader/instagram/video/) and
copied them to Youtube so you don't have to log in to view them.)

[APA Hotel Tsubamesanjo
Ekimae](https://www.apahotel.com/en/hotel/kousinetsu/tsubamesanjo-ekimae/)
is really the best I have used this walk in terms of price per
ameneties.

Private bath, bed, TV with free VOD including adult content, plus a
larger than micro sized toothpaste, and a nice toothbrush with soft
bristles.  Just 3700 yen.  Nice.
