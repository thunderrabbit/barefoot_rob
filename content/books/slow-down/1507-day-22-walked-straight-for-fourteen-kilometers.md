Next destination is essentially straight for 14 km.

Okay it's decided then, we will call it SUPER CENTER PLANT 5. Everyone in agreement?

These doors would have to be paper light for these door stoppers to have a chance of actually stopping them if they really opened.

Is this a way out outhouse?

[![2021 may 06 looks like an outhouse out in the middle of fields](//b.robnugen.com/quests/walk-to-niigata/2021/en_route/day-22/thumbs/2021_may_06_looks_like_an_outhouse_out_in_the_middle_of_fields.jpeg)](//b.robnugen.com/quests/walk-to-niigata/2021/en_route/day-22/2021_may_06_looks_like_an_outhouse_out_in_the_middle_of_fields.jpeg)

In any case, it's right above the water.

I did a couple of livestreams on Instagram yesterday.  (I [downloaded](https://ingramer.com/downloader/instagram/video/) and copied them to Youtube so you don't have to log in to view them.)

[APA Hotel Tsubamesanjo Ekimae](https://www.apahotel.com/en/hotel/kousinetsu/tsubamesanjo-ekimae/) is really the best I have used this walk in terms of price per ameneties.

Private bath, bed, TV with free VOD including adult content, plus a larger than micro sized toothpaste, and a nice toothbrush with soft bristles.  Just 3700 yen.  Nice.

Day 22 was
