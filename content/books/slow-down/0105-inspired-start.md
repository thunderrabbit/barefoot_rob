1. Allow easy sorting of files (by title, not date) (finished 21 August 2021)
2. Write about perfectionism and procrastination

In some ways of thinking, the walk hasn't had any effect on my life whatsoever. And just yesterday, two of my close friends, or Nakama talked about how the walk had a big impact on them. So that has helped inspire me to continue the quest and continue writing my book. In some ways, I think I am a perfectionist, and have this idea that the book must be perfect or not at all. But as my good friend, Mark says, done is better than perfect. So with that in mind, let's write this book.

Today, I am 18,762 days old. So in some ways of thinking, that is the day number of this journey. I numbered the days of the walk, and struggle a lot with getting that system to fit in with the system of days counted in the outer world. For example, I call the hotel and ask them about my reservation on the 20th. And they said, the reservation was for a different date. And I realized the date I was using was the day number of my walk, not the calendar date that I would arrive.

So that's an example of the difficulty I had. Linking my world with the real world. writing this book, in a way is another difficulty. Because in my world, I don't have time to write the book. And in the real world, I have stated that I would write the book. In my mind, there are people waiting for the book, but also in my mind, there are people getting along with their lives and have written me off or written off the book. So which is it?

Step by step, we move forward. So let's see if we can do this thing.

My friend Michael calls this navel gazing. I think, as I'm wondering aloud about my life and the choices. I intend to make this book available free on my website at this URL https://www.robnugen.com/books/slow-down/, and you can even watch its creation if you watch one of these other URLs

So with that, let's get started.

I have often said it makes no difference what you do.  And then again it makes a huge difference.

3. Write about spirit and just do it

Humans were made in the image of God. So this doesn't mean that God is shaped like a human, or vice versa. It means that humans are creative. We have freewill, and can create. According to our free will, within the limits of karma and physicality, we can create and do whatever we want. So, going on a walk across to him, might seem pretty ridiculous, but there's literally no reason not to do it

from the point of view. We can do whatever we want to do. So,

All we have to do is start planning. And for me the biggest concern was getting the time off work, and then getting support from my wife to be away for that long.  She tends to worry about things more than I do. And

it took some long discussions to assure her that I would remain safe during the trip. At the end, my head, I have two eyes. And I like my feet intact. So, all my body parts intact. So my definite intent intention to remain intact for as long as possible, including the duration of this walk. So, she finally agreed. Having the support was invaluable.

As we shall soon see. Day number one walking from Yokohama, to my house. Our house woke up early, they took the train to Rinko Park in Yokohama. I

kept my bicycle at home which meant I needed to roll the bag to the train station, so that I could

not have to go by the train station. Walk is 21 kilometers, and would actually be basically 5% of my walk across the island.

Super great to have.

It felt super great to have support of Mark

Shraddhan, et cetera. I'm already forgetting the names of everyone who showed up on the first day, Lucas was there. Mark your daughter. And Lin came, a woman named Yumi came I believe she gave me gifts, chocolate and crackers. She had also done wrong. Similarly, Malinois, we did a walking meditation that morning, which gave people a chance to connect with the earth, and the present. And then we did.

Did a foot photo shoot at the water with my foot in the water on the Oklahoma side of things, and lots of hugs and then basically started walking. The beautiful thing is that my wife had driven the route, many, many times, and knew exactly how to get home from there. On this day, I didn't have to use my phone as a map, and could just see if it has a camera, which I did on the way from Yokohama to our house. One of the first pictures, was that Fran√ßois sitting next to a cool statue. And my friend. Shraddhan helped take some photos there as well. I was glad that Shraddhan and Lin got along well,




Do whatever you want.  Nothing matters.  No one cares.

Do whatever you want.  It makes all the difference in the world.
