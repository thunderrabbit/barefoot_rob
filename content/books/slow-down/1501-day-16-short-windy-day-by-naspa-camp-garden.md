Lots of wind buffetting these tents and inflatable tent covers

Day Sixteen was relatively short, and our last short walking day.
This was the day I wore my SOGO shirt and ran across the side of a dam
in a damn beautiful area.

The onsen at Hirokawa is large warm, and covered in cool tiles of
varying sizes.  Very nicely done!
