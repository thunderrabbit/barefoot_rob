Starting this day, I was feeling genki so went back to the convenience store before
heading up the hill and on my way.  So happy with their response to my story
because they actually gave me some free products
including spray cooling roll-on and a neck cooling thing.

This is the first day I talked to Brian in Corpus.  I actually got so involved talking to them that I missed my turn and had to backtrack a bit.

We were entertained by the tree in the trail.

On this day I tried recording some video to show myself on the trip, plodding along, eating lunch, etc.

I met a fellow traveler https://ogasho.at.webry.info next to a river

JUST IN CASE THere is a claim that I ate curry in the bathtub before today,
I am 99% sure it was on April 20th because that's how it's in my album
