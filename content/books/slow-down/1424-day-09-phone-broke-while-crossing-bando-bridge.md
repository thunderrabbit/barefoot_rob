Good morning from day 9, a day that I'll get to see Lin.

She's going to drive out and meet me at the hot spring place this afternoon!

Here is François on an octopus slide thing

It may be a small power tower but we get to walk right under it

I saw this from the side as I approached.  Woah something interesting going on here!

Ah! It's from a power plant.  Hydroelectric plant yay!

Coming closer to the plant, looks like there is more frothy action around the corner

oh sweet! Water pours down into the little river from something above it..

audio transcript:

I found a what I believe to be an electrical power plant that hydro
Electric plant and I described the water pouring off of us like a
small river pouring that cascading into a bigger river as like 10
bathtubs per second worth of water. And I don't know, what was a more
common unit of measure and I guess, cubic meters per second in Japan
is it's usually cubic feet per second in the US, maybe yards per
second anyway. I measured it and and estimated it to be 10 bathtubs
per second. pouring from the small river into a big river. I took a
lot of pictures with with my old phone then I was like, Oh, I have
this cool camera. So I went and took photos with the cool camera of
this area as well. And so kind of did a little backtracking. But
anyway, I took a bunch of photos, I really enjoyed seeing the area and
taking lots of photos, even though no one else in the area seemed to
care about it anymore. Because they had already seen it. But um, there
weren't a lot of people in the area, but a few so that was that was a
cool thing. And I wonder if I can find where that was on the map.

title: 'Day Nine Finished'
---

After my phone died, I was already pretty close to Sky Terme Shibukawa
so was able to walk sans phone from Bando Bashi to Sky Terme Shibukawa
with the help of locals pointing the way.

As of yesterday, Lin planned to meet me at Sky Terme Shibukawa (super
sento (public bath)).  She did that, but then *drove* me to the hotel
because my phone died and I wanted to get it resolved as quickly as
possible.  Phone shop is closed until tomorrow (and booked until May),
but we will try to get in tomorrow and get a replacement handset.

Anyway, about today, the sento was nice, not huge, but has a great
view, being 5 stories above green fields.  Nice open air deck.
