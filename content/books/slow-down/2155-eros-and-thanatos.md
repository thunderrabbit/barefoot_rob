I have been doing monthly check ins with my friend in Hawaii, Robert
golden for a few years now at least two years. I think it may have
just been it was pre pandemic actually as well. So anyway, today is
it's 8:34am on May 1, Monday. May 1 2023. Oh no, it broke the name it
really changed it. E R. O S. So, we've been doing these check ins and
today. During one of his stories, Robert introduced these two words
and arrows, he said is the flow of love and Thanatos is the flow of
death. I suddenly had a little vision of a chapter of this book as a
result of that I never thought about the flow of death. I guess it
could be perhaps articulated as a fire. Fire consumes and kills and
then gives life and so I had this vision that we come down to the
point of, of God and the language breaks down but what I call the E P
P. ever present present is where arrows and Thanatos are merged or the
same or somehow equivalent. We can't have one without the other. And
yeah, just really seen how at the micro level they can't be
distinguished. And so maybe it's like this concept of the far left and
the far right being the opposite ends of a horseshoe. The they end up
being basically the same. And so, we have maybe that kind of a analogy
would fit that the flow of life and the flow of death. I said love
before I actually look it up are one and the same when you get far
enough to the to the periphery. So I wanted to add a little chapter
around that and like my ideas of what is good and bad. Are you know
not pointless, but they're hard to distinguish when we get down to the
far ends of the spectrum. And just having this sense of slowing down
to bring my title back into the to this piece, slowing down so that we
can experience each microsecond of life one one bit at a time. And
really dissolving into the flow of life and time. And this is where we
have experiences of athletes get into the zone or into the flow state
and just being really, really present and discovering that it's all
one in the same from different perspectives. Yeah, so that's my little
topic about Eros and Thantos. Thanks for listening and talk to you
soon. じゃねー. Bye bye
