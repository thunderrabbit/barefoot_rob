Turned out to be a great idea to be home on the first night and
morning of second day.  I was able to finalize packing and go over my
list again and again.

Always wondering what I should take and trying to predict what I would need and how I might use it.

Lovely to have support from our neighbors who actually pulled my bag
up the hill.  I resisted not letting them help me, remembering that
it's better to accept help than to reject it.

## Helping makes others feel good. ##

    Think back to the last time you helped someone out. It felt
    terrific, didn't it? To refuse an offer of help is to deprive
    someone of that same wonderful feeling.
    That's a very unkind thing to do.

The walk to Yomiuriland is pretty easy except for one set of stairs
going over Odakyu Line train tracks.  Otherwise just a long slow
downward slope and long slow upward slope.  45 minutes without my big
bag.

I met Missy at Yomiuriland, where we rode rides until the park closed
at 6pm.  Lin and them were already in the pizza place, waiting for us
to finish.

It almost started a fight, though I thought I had been pretty clear
that we would go enjoy rides in the park.  Everyone was invited to
join, but apparently preferred pizza over roller coasters.

I didn't take many / any pictures, but I had a student named Kanta, so
I took a picture of his namesake

Pizza was great, and I was grateful to Lin getting the manager to let
the group stay past our 90 minute limit.  He seemed quite pleased that
I was walking across Honshu, kicking off from his restaurant.

Otter: the convo has been updated:

After the amusement park, and after the pizza, it became time to
go. And though it was a really great time, why we did it, it was much
later than expected. And just for fun it was raining. So we said our
goodbyes and gratitude to the pizza place owner and went outside some
people left to their car and some came with me to the locker where I
had stashed my bag and coats in all my gear and stuff. So they want me
put all that stuff back together. And I don't know if there's any
photos of it actually. Which seems strange but hope we can pull some
out somewhere. Then it was like Okay, bye. And hugs everyone and I
headed off into the rain over the hill. And Lynn was apparently really
worried. saying like, I hope, I hope he's okay and all that stuff. And
Missy was like dude, he's not going to battle. He's going to walk
across the country with a bunch of convenience stores and it'll be
fine.

But it was fine in a long walk. Rain rain rain over the hill and down
a very steep hill narrow edge way. Somehow I did it barefoot, because
wearing sandals would have been too slippery and risk ripping the
sandals is a strong sandals. The sandals are not that strong. They
said they are not that strong of sandals and down the hill and then
stray for a long ways. And just really curious to see this road from a
different perspective and to see it noise slowly and to see it in the
rain and the scary car is driving by real quick. So quite
interesting. Now walk walk, walk, walk, walk. Recognizing that I was
walking past a train station that I walked to before going down some
stairs that were over there and realize realizing I could have gone up
the stairs but then glad I didn't because the stairs would have been
wet and lots of BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP to go down with my giant bag
so the street with a smooth slope was actually better. But it was neat
to see the perspective is I oh that's the station down there. Here's a
walkway where I could go back and be back where I know where I
am. Them

then sort of walking left along the highway, cross the street and the
rain was still raining pretty pretty effectively and feel a different
texture on the sidewalk which was nice sensation going through the
dark and rainy, giant sidewalk found a very interesting recycling
center. I think I can find those pictures that I may have taken some
photos but it was hard to take photos with all the rain. And
fortunately, I had a waterproof phone but dragging my gear and having
camera to take photos and how the phone being rained. On was kind of
non responsive or incorrectly responding to the raindrops as opposed
to my fingers and I also had the map to deal with the phone so it was
really kind of a pain in the ass to be following the map and then try
to switch to camera mode and the phone is like Oh, raindrop, raindrop
and reacting to all the raindrops. You could barely see what I was
looking at it was kind of foggy on the camera lens maybe. But overall
was fine. I enjoyed walking through some review. Let's have water
coming down the another hill. It was a curvy hill it was curving up
into the right. Getting into the two o area that's the city to o ch Q
o

and walk walk walk I found a water fountain that is the middle of the
night so no one was there and it was raining anyway so I splashed in
the fountain had a lot of fun splashing in the water and just
basically enjoyed myself took some pictures of a kind of a the
entrance to a park or something maybe it was a cemetery I don't
know. That was before the water fountain in the city. eventually got
to the hotel where I was staying, utterly drenched and soaked and the
guy at the front desk was like hello. Hi I made a reservation. He's
like you know why the hell he's so wet? Would you have an umbrella?
And I just explained you I've walked here from Yomiuri land he's like,
okay, come on. Like sorry about the water. He's like, don't worry
about it. It's like it just drenching dripping water on the tile
there. It was tile as well as had to walk carefully. Got into the room
and basically just collapsed. That hung up my junk to dry. My intent
was my clothes. And it was all dry by mornings I don't remember being
wet in the morning. That's one good thing about the bathrooms and
hotels they tend to keep them really dry so there won't be mildew or
whatever. And closed, dried and headed out the next morning. The I
think the same guy was there maybe I don't remember. But that was
cool. That was a walk from Yomiuri land to the hotel in Chuo
