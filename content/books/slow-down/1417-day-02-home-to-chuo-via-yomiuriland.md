Turned out to be a great idea to be home on the first night and
morning of second day.  I was able to finalize packing and go over my
list again and again.

Always wondering what I should take and trying to predict what I would need and how I might use it.

Lovely to have support from our neighbors who actually pulled my bag
up the hill.  I resisted not letting them help me, remembering that
it's better to accept help than to reject it.

## Helping makes others feel good. ##

    Think back to the last time you helped someone out. It felt
    terrific, didn't it? To refuse an offer of help is to deprive
    someone of that same wonderful feeling.
    That's a very unkind thing to do.

The walk to Yomiuriland is pretty easy except for one set of stairs
going over Odakyu Line train tracks.  Otherwise just a long slow
downward slope and long slow upward slope.  45 minutes without my big
bag.

I met Missy at Yomiuriland, where we rode rides until the park closed
at 6pm.  Lin and them were already in the pizza place, waiting for us
to finish.

It almost started a fight, though I thought I had been pretty clear
that we would go enjoy rides in the park.  Everyone was invited to
join, but apparently preferred pizza over roller coasters.

I didn't take many / any pictures, but I had a student named Kanta, so
I took a picture of his namesake

Pizza was great, and I was grateful to Lin getting the manager to let
the group stay past our 90 minute limit.  He seemed quite pleased that
I was walking across Honshu, kicking off from his restaurant.
