"Now what" can be taken to as fine detail as we like.  
In any moment, we have choices.  At each moment, how do we decide what to do?

#### personal mission

This could come from a personal mission.
For example, I have a mission I developed for myself in ManKind Project.

    I create a world of love and connection
    by connecting and listening.

Actually *this* version just popped out of my mind.
The second line of the previous one was like "by leading and facilitating"

Having a personal mission allows asking useful questions at any moment. e.g.

* "What action will move me toward my mission?"
* "Will this action move me toward or away from my mission?"

#### emotional body

Another way to choose what we do is by feeling our emotions.  Generally I have
found that my most effective actions are if I move toward *excitement* AND *fear*
at the same time.

The excitement means it's something I care about.  The fear means I don't know
how it will turn out.  Put those together and get *go for it!*  I haven't yet
experienced times where this guided me poorly.

Oh, by the way, my broken shoulder wants me to mention that if the feeling body
features *tired* or *rushed* or *anxious*, it may be good to SLOW DOWN.

#### SLOW DOWN

This would make a great title for a book!  ;-)
Allowing your mind to control things is a great way to get muddled up in some
mind stuff.
Allowing your awareness to open to subtler energies can be a way to sense insights
coming from a more loving realm.

Again, I'm talking about God here, or higher power. Maybe I'll introduce a term
I made: EPP, or Every Present Present.  I'm not sure it applies here, but it just
came to me, so there ya go.

I created the term EPP (not the thing it points to) when I created my own religion.
That was while reading the book _Shaving the Inside of your Skull_ by Mel Ash,
who apparently got it from Timothy Leary:

  This is the advice from Timothy Leary in *The Politics of Ecstasy*.  He says that
  in order to make your own religion work you should "write down and define your:
  Goals, Roles, Rituals, Rules, Vocabulary, Values, Space-time Locales, Mythic Context.
  Develop your own rituals and costumes . . . You will eventually find yourself engaged
  in a series of sacred moments which feel right to you..."

Dang I ain't typing the rest now, but it's on page 173 of Mel Ash's book.
