Granddad: "I'm just damn fine."
<br>Emotions are important

Monner: "Stop sending me these checks."
<br>God loves me no matter what

Ricky: "Now it's time to build the magnificent structure on the foundation you've created."
<br>My life has purpose

Fred: "We can't blame dad for our problems anymore."
<br>I choose how I show up in the world

Dad: "If two trees are leaning against one another, what happens if one falls?"
<br>Find your inner strength

Ma: "You boys are driving me up the wall"
<br>Parents are people too.

Jon: "That Guy in Austin"
<br>no one knows who you are.  Use that to your advantage; everyone is too worried about themselves to worry about you.

Rob: "It takes longer to live a life than read a biography"
<br>change takes time in 3D.

Anikiko: "Follow The Whispers"
<br>How many different ways can I say the same thing?

John: "Tell them I'm the expensive one"
<br>You create your own life

Paola: "If you've found a program that works, grab on."
<br>No need to compare spiritual paths
<br>Prodigal son story

Frederick Marx: "it falls to each generation to teach the new generation"
<br>I burst into tears when I read that.  Oh fuck.  I can't do it.  
I must do it.  Aaaggggghhh  and that was.... (checks email) 8 months ago.

Robert Golden: "What do you really want to do?"
<br>well, I want to walk across Japan..

All you -> me:

<br>This is like a spiritual life biography for you.

And a key story you want to bring up across the course is not crying at his funeral.
<br>emotions are important

The way that you express yourself as the way that the world responds to you.

Now the lesson in here is learning to tie it another
one is learning about gratitude.

That your grandma doesn't care what you call her
<br>using that as an allegory for understanding that
God doesn't care what you call him or her

allowing people to recognize that they are here for a reason

That there must be a reason for life,

Tuning into the will of God as another one.

God dwells in you as you
<br>which is a core part of what you want to get across in that.
