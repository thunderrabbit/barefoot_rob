Things I learned from young people:

Robert Golden: "Have you read _Whatever Arises, Love That_"

Robert M: "Welcome to speak at TEDxOgikubo"

Soness Stevens: "Step on the red dot"

Pavel: "we met at HackerX"
<br>Shine uniquely

UA: "Be all you can be isn't necessarily what God wants you to be."

UA: "God as you understand God"

podcast: "Tithing tells God what you think is important in the world."

podcast / Rob "Tithing tells God you have enough money to tithe."

Emma Wild: "It may take time.  It will grow if you keep at it and continue long term."

Dai: "There is no time for any of that."
<br>addictions, distrust, hatred, fear,

All you -> me:

<br>This is like a spiritual life biography for you.

And a key story you want to bring up across the course is not crying at his funeral.
<br>emotions are important

The way that you express yourself as the way that the world responds to you.

Now the lesson in here is learning to tie it another
one is learning about gratitude.

That your grandma doesn't care what you call her
<br>using that as an allegory for understanding that
God doesn't care what you call him or her

allowing people to recognize that they are here for a reason

That there must be a reason for life,

Tuning into the will of God as another one.

God dwells in you as you
<br>which is a core part of what you want to get across in that.
