Part Two of the TJ bikes story I got to the meditation center did the
meditation I should make that its own chapter

okay here it comes meditation sorry So

doing the meditation was in a way harder than riding my bicycle out to
Kyoto to do it. My brain was like, chaos who could run it around like
doing jumping jacks the whole time. I just couldn't stay awake. In the
morning. I got grumbled and by one of the the Oregon I don't know what
the word is organizer or leader. When I didn't wake up in the morning,
and I Yeah, it was tough. It got harder and harder and harder for the
nine days. And then on the last day than I was suddenly like, maybe
it's harder not over the eight days in the last day, suddenly, like
ninth day, like, oh, you I suddenly got it. And I understood the
value. And then on the 10th day, we were able to speak again. I took a
moment to just cry that I had completed it or out of relief. I didn't
really want to talk to anyone, to be honest. But we did talk a bit and
that through those conversations, I actually got so number of the I
told the guy that didn't have a job and he mentioned that I could
contact a man named he Dale the right today. I think it's him
anyway. And volunteer as a lab rat in Kagoshima, which I ended up
doing a few times and made a couple 10s of $1,000 Overall, that was
nice, but main point being that the person was quite challenging. And
at the end, I determined two things. One that I would do it again,
haven't yet and I determined like a like what I would tell people who
were you asking about the past and it's like is that if you think you
can't do it, you don't want to do it, then definitely don't do
it. However, if you think you'd be interested and it might be a good
thing, then definitely definitely do it. As challenging as it is. It
it's like quite a very few people like on the fence. Here there's like
if it could be good or not, you know, maybe if it's a case that
someone has a like a min. A mentor, like what's the word, like mental
condition that needs monitoring by a doctor or what have you. I mean,
I don't know. But beyond those types of issues, just let the curiosity
be the judge if you're curious, you think it'd be cool, definitely do
it. Otherwise definitely don't do it. It was really, really
challenging. I'm glad I did. And it really helped with the next part
of my TJ bike story. So I'll just put Vipassana here at the top. And
they don't end this chapter.

Oh, I was saying I will end this chapter
