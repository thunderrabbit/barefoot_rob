    title: 'awesome valley outside windowed tunnel'

There must be a way to get up there

Some of the wall anchors did not have covers; I didn't take a picture, but there were three cables inside.

Muiamacchi Hutte was a great place to stay last night and get in out of the rain.  Nice clean rooms and great hot onsen.

A couple in a small black van pass me and then stopped reversed and greeted me when I approached.

They gave me two cans of coffee from the back of their van and apologize for offering so little.  I couldn't express enough how much it meant to me; they are actually the first people to stop and offer something along the way.

Super gratitude for their gift.

Before I even had time to go down the hill from where I was able to take pictures of the Japanese Alps, I saw a red car approaching so jumped out of the way but then the driver stopped and was a hey it's me from NASPA, and I'm like oh my God hi it's so good to see you!

She asked about Jason and I explained that he went on ahead, needing to finish the walk by the 7th of May.  So from here on we are both walking separately.

She wished me good luck and went on her way.

So interesting to have so many connections happening here on this stretch of highway!

By the way, the coordinates of this entry look much more likely to be correct than on the previous two or three entries.. at least this time they're showing me next to a highway instead of in the middle of small roads through small fields.

    title: 'add this to summary of yesterday day 18'


Just before walking under one of the snowsheds it started to hail a little bit
as part of the precipitation.  The hailstones were only a few millimeters across,
but definitely not sleet because it wasn't that cold.  
I ate one of the hailstones and it was great.  :-)

For several long barefoot segments, I was walking in the street which was much
nicer than the adjacent sidewalk.  I could see way down the street and move out
of the way when cars came, which they rarely did because it was so rural.

Just before Urasa Station, I interacted with two groups of people:
two teenage Japanese boys who took pictures with me including
[@kousei_mountains on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/kousei_mountains/),
and three people speaking English, but who didn't seem interested in talking
when I said hello and such.  I felt a little sad because I haven't gotten to
speak much English (in person) during this trip.

Day 18 was
