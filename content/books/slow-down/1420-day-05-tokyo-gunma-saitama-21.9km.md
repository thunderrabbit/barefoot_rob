I received some gifts from the local convenience store after the manager
read my shirt and asked why I was walking barefoot across Japan.

This is the first time that I used William's recommendation for how to say what
I wanted to say in Japanese.

"When you're living you can do anything but if you're dead and can't do anything."

Just before hanging up with Brian and Gavin in Corpus, I showed them this tree
with reflectors around it.  No reflectors on the tree, and for some reason the
path could not go around the tree.

I am glad this tree was allowed to stay.
I guess this was a cedar forest before roads and paths came through.

Thanks to Mark for showing me how changing the _________ allows different things
to be visible in the photo.  In the bottom photo, I tried to emphasize the reflectors.


Starting this day, I was feeling genki so went back to the convenience store before
heading up the hill and on my way.  So happy with their response to my story
because they actually gave me some free products
including spray cooling roll-on and a neck cooling thing.

This is the first day I talked to Brian in Corpus.  I actually got so involved talking to them that I missed my turn and had to backtrack a bit.

We were entertained by the tree in the trail.

On this day I tried recording some video to show myself on the trip, plodding along, eating lunch, etc.

He said he has bicycled from here to niigata and he knew the exact mileage.   

He's also biked or hiked in Iran and other countries I didn't recognize the names of.

    title: 'Day Five finished'

I arrived in the lobby of Hotel Park Inn at 6pm.  The hotel seems nice,
offering some free snacks and "free" dinner for people who pay full price.

I took a bath and pretty much expect to go to sleep soon.
