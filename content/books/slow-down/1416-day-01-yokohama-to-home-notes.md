looking at the whole map, I realized it was so close to being a coast to coast walk.   Just add a single day of 20km and bingo Coast to Coast.

Wow and the park is called Rinko Park

Fucked up her bag and my jacket just on the way to our station.  Basically the concrete sanded holes into her bag and my raincoat.

Lin joined.  She knew the way by heart!!  So grateful

Everyone joined at first!

Walking home, taking photos of Fran√ßois as Lin walked ahead.

Shraddhan joined for quite a bit.  So glad they were happily talking with each other when I was slow with my bag.

Pizza place; he paid!

Bye Shraddhan. Photo teeny

First bag upgrade; proof of concept but crushed the box lid.

Second bag upgrade to waterproof.. we still use the waterproof box in her garden.

Stopped at halfway(?) point at conveni

So tired and so genki, and so lost even when relatively close to home.  Super glad to have Lin's guidance.

5% finished by the time we got home.
