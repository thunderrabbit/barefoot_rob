Just today I got the entries sorted by Title.  This was something I
have wanted to do for a long time!

Now, when I visit
https://www.robnugen.com/en/books/slow-down/
I can see the whole smattering of entries prettyyy much in the order that they happened.

It's been a whole year since the midpoint of my walk.  In fact, a year
ago I was navigating with paper maps after my phone died.

Today it's raining.  How glorious is the timing that I didn't need to
use paper maps on a rainy day?

This entry will be committed to my website repo just after
