This is the day I walked to SPAMu, which I selected for its name that reminds me
of SPAM, the salty pork blob "meat" stuff.  As opposed to SPAM, SPAMu was expensive!

The front desk person almost didn't let me in until I reminded her I had made a reservation.  
She said she remembered, so "let" me stay.
At $180 a night, I think it woulda been fine to kick me out,
though that's all in hindsight, a year later.

At the time, my feet were in agony to the point that I was wearing sandals as I
arrived in the hotel.  She seemed very unimpressed that I was wearing sandals, and
I felt bad that I assumed no one here would know I had said otherwise.
