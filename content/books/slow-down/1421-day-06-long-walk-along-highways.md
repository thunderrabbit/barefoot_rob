    title: 'Good morning Day 6'
    location: 'geo:36.03059,139.37445;u=65'

Let me just first say I am tired / not wanting to get moving today.   Spirits are a bit low; I seem to have lost my preferred foot cream (prescription ointment), and while looking through my bag found things I have not used yet.  KUMON book and Way of the Peaceful Warrior (volume 3).

I knew the trip would be tough, so continuing to move.  I think the honeymoon stage is ending and getting into hostile territory (yikes stripes!).

* honeymoon
* hostile
* humor
* home

Four stages of adaptation to new challenge (as offered by Jason when he gave me the Deep Blue, which has been amazing; thank you!)

I found some cool green rocks for François to climb.

There's a sign saying the name of this town 滑川町 Namgawa Town

[![2021 apr 20 François on an interestingly placed new shrine](//b.robnugen.com/quests/walk-to-niigata/2021/en_route/day-06/thumbs/2021_apr_20_francois_on_an_interestingly_placed_new_shrine.jpeg)](//b.robnugen.com/quests/walk-to-niigata/2021/en_route/day-06/2021_apr_20_francois_on_an_interestingly_placed_new_shrine.jpeg)          

I saw François on what looks like a new shrine in the middle of somewhere
that people wouldn't see very often..

    title: 'construction zone featuring no sidewalk'

I came up to a section where the sidewalk was missing...

[![2021 apr 20 missing sidewalk](//b.robnugen.com/quests/walk-to-niigata/2021/en_route/day-06/thumbs/2021_apr_20_missing_sidewalk.jpeg)](//b.robnugen.com/quests/walk-to-niigata/2021/en_route/day-06/2021_apr_20_missing_sidewalk.jpeg)

And I was able to make my way through it even with the construction worker guys there.

I didn't get a picture of that, but I did get to discover just how hot fresh poured asphalt can be.

Also got a chance to take a picture of François on rabbit shaped barrier holders.

And then the most amazing thing is finding this new manhole cover it hasn't even had its plastic taken off yet...

[![2021 apr 20 new manhole cover](//b.robnugen.com/quests/walk-to-niigata/2021/en_route/day-06/thumbs/2021_apr_20_new_manhole_cover.jpeg)](//b.robnugen.com/quests/walk-to-niigata/2021/en_route/day-06/2021_apr_20_new_manhole_cover.jpeg)

Here it is in context with the sidewalk ripped out around it

Francois found the sidewalk!

    location: 'geo:36.07786,139.29579;u=135.60000610351562'

Struggling along the hot asphalt here, I paused to look up and saw this interesting shot

[![2021 apr 20 power tower in green area](//b.robnugen.com/quests/walk-to-niigata/2021/en_route/day-06/thumbs/2021_apr_20_power_tower_in_green_area.jpeg)](//b.robnugen.com/quests/walk-to-niigata/2021/en_route/day-06/2021_apr_20_power_tower_in_green_area.jpeg)

    title: 'I wore my sandals'

With 7km to go on Day 6, I put my sandals on to walk the rest of the way to SPAMU.  My injuries were still painful but much faster as they were not compounding

    title: 'foot soles, Day 6'

Here are the soles of my feet, photos taken last night, at the end of day 6.

[![2021 apr 22 right foot sole](//b.robnugen.com/quests/walk-to-niigata/2021/en_route/day-06/thumbs/2021_apr_22_right_foot_sole.jpeg)](//b.robnugen.com/quests/walk-to-niigata/2021/en_route/day-06/2021_apr_22_right_foot_sole.jpeg)
[![2021 apr 22 left foot sole](//b.robnugen.com/quests/walk-to-niigata/2021/en_route/day-06/thumbs/2021_apr_22_left_foot_sole.jpeg)](//b.robnugen.com/quests/walk-to-niigata/2021/en_route/day-06/2021_apr_22_left_foot_sole.jpeg)

These photos were taken at SPAMU   


This is the day I walked to SPAMu, which I selected for its name that reminds me
of SPAM, the salty pork blob "meat" stuff.  As opposed to SPAM, SPAMu was expensive!

The front desk person almost didn't let me in until I reminded her I had made a reservation.  
She said she remembered, so "let" me stay.
At $180 a night, I think it woulda been fine to kick me out,
though that's all in hindsight, a year later.

At the time, my feet were in agony to the point that I was wearing sandals as I
arrived in the hotel.  She seemed very unimpressed that I was wearing sandals, and
I felt bad that I assumed no one here would know I had said otherwise.
