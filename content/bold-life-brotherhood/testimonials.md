    For me the Bold Life Brotherhood has been a gentle journey into
    self-awareness. It has helped me to resolve some of my
    long-standing personal issues and has been a stepping stone for me
    to communicate better with my family.  I'm very grateful to Rob
    and his steadfast dedication to helping the world evolve in a
    positive manner.
