I am using GoGetFunding to help raise money for the walk, with proceeds going to
[Tokyo English Life line (TELL)](https://telljp.com/).
TELL is dedicated to providing effective support and counseling services
to Japan's international community and its increasing mental health needs.

(I had been using Shopify, but it is not a proper crowd funding site,
and the cost of the Shopify store continues regardless of donations / purchases.)

So far, eight copies of the book have been pre-ordered.

Assuming 2500 yen of each book purchased so far can be used for covering costs below,
20,000 yen can be used for costs below.

## 20,000 / 226,000 yen

# ██████________________________________________________   9% funded!
