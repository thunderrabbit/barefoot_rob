I am planning to walk barefoot coast to coast (the short direction) across Japan's main island.

It's a personal challenge as well as
raising awareness for self care / suicide prevention.
Also hopefully encouragement for you to keep pushing your limits!


I am using GoGetFunding to help raise money for the walk, with proceeds going to
[Tokyo English Life line (TELL)](https://telljp.com/).
TELL is dedicated to providing effective support and counseling services
to Japan's international community and its increasing mental health needs.
