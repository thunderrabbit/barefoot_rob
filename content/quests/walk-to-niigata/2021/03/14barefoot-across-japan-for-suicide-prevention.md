I am planning to walk barefoot coast to coast (the short direction) across Japan's main island.

**How can walking barefoot help prevent suicides?**

Walking barefoot includes several
[relaxation techniques to reduce stress](https://www.webmd.com/balance/features/blissing-out-10-relaxation-techniques-reduce-stress-spot) including

1. Meditate,
2. Be Present,
3. Tune into your body,
4. Get Moving, and
5. Decompress.

Being barefoot keeps me keenly aware
of the present moment with each step.
This keen awareness is a type of meditation,
keeping my conscious awareness
focused in the present moment.

While walking barefoot,
I definitely *tune into my body*
and
*get moving*
...
and my feet are *decompressed*,
happily free from the confines of shoes!

I think if more people were aware
from moment to moment that would
help lower stress in general.

Walking across Honshu
is a personal challenge as well as
raising awareness for self care / suicide prevention.
Also hopefully encouragement for you to keep pushing your limits!

I am using GoGetFunding to help raise money for the walk,
with **proceeds after expenses going to
[Tokyo English Life line (TELL)](https://telljp.com/).
TELL is dedicated to providing effective support and counseling services**
to Japan's international community and its increasing mental health needs.
