A couple in a small black van pass me and then stopped reversed and greeted me when I approached.

They gave me two cans of coffee from the back of their van and apologize for offering so little.  I couldn't express enough how much it meant to me; they are actually the first people to stop and offer something along the way.

Super gratitude for their gift.
