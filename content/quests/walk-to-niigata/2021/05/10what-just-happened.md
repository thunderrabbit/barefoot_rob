Wow yeah it's like I'm just glad it's over, sad it's over, and not really sure how to integrate all the pieces.

Plus picking up the pieces of broken stories to put into one coherent narrative..

There were lots of times that I found things on the map that I thought would be really cool and then they simply were not as cool and as I expected.

* This or that park / garden
* Planet Restroom

And then there were some things I had no idea I would see that were really quite cool.

* Abandoned hotel in Sarugakyo Onsen area
* Collapsible walls next to the highway.
* A trash collector at the end of a small river.
* Guest House Googoo is little brother to delicious Italian restaurant Googoo
