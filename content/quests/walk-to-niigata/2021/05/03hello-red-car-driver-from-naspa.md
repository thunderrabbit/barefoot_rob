Before I even had time to go down the hill from where I was able to take pictures of the Japanese Alps, I saw a red car approaching so jumped out of the way but then the driver stopped and was a hey it's me from NASPA, and I'm like oh my God hi it's so good to see you!

She asked about Jason and I explained that he went on ahead, needing to finish the walk by the 7th of May.  So from here on we are both walking separately.

She wished me good luck and went on her way.

So interesting to have so many connections happening here on this stretch of highway!

By the way, the coordinates of this entry look much more likely to be correct than on the previous two or three entries.. at least this time they're showing me next to a highway instead of in the middle of small roads through small fields.
