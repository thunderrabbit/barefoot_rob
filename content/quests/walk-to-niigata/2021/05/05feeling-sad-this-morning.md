I'm feeling quite sad this morning, possibly because the walk is coming to an end, combined with that I haven't done a lot of the things that I thought I would do, for example interviews with locals using my audio recorder, or make updates on all the different platforms that I had planned to update, including the crowdfunding campaign site.

Oh, and I haven't finished all the letters that I told people I would write.

And and there have been some contributions on the crowdfunding site where people have asked for letters or postcards but I can't figure out how to download them to get those addresses so I'm not sure what to do there.

I was able to figure it out before but my tired brain just couldn't do it this morning and then I forgot about it before I packed up my computer.

Also sad that my computer seems to have rejected the battery starting over a week ago.  Well the computer reports the battery is at 100% it immediately shuts off immediately when I unplug the power adapter.

Fortunately, the computer itself has been working fine when it's plugged in and I've used it to great success in keeping my website pretty much up to date.

The walk today is 15 km so significantly shorter than yesterday, though I'm starting 2 hours later than I did yesterday.

I have a call with my friend in Texas in 45 minutes and then session with a client tonight.  It's wonderful to be able to work while I'm traveling.
