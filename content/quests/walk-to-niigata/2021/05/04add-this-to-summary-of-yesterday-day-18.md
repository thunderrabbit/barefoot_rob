Just before walking under one of the snowsheds it started to hail a little bit
as part of the precipitation.  The hailstones were only a few millimeters across,
but definitely not sleet because it wasn't that cold.  
I ate one of the hailstones and it was great.  :-)

For several long barefoot segments, I was walking in the street which was much
nicer than the adjacent sidewalk.  I could see way down the street and move out
of the way when cars came, which they rarely did because it was so rural.

Just before Urasa Station, I interacted with two groups of people:
two teenage Japanese boys who took pictures with me including
[@kousei_mountains on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/kousei_mountains/),
and three people speaking English, but who didn't seem interested in talking
when I said hello and such.  I felt a little sad because I haven't gotten to
speak much English (in person) during this trip.
