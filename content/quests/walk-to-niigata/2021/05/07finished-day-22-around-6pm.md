I did a couple of livestreams on Instagram yesterday.  (I [downloaded](https://ingramer.com/downloader/instagram/video/) and copied them to Youtube so you don't have to log in to view them.)

[APA Hotel Tsubamesanjo Ekimae](https://www.apahotel.com/en/hotel/kousinetsu/tsubamesanjo-ekimae/) is really the best I have used this walk in terms of price per ameneties.

Private bath, bed, TV with free VOD including adult content, plus a larger than micro sized toothpaste, and a nice toothbrush with soft bristles.  Just 3700 yen.  Nice.
