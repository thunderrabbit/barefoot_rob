Just for the record, I am choosing not to walk about 60 m the wrong direction including across a busy Street so I can head toward my destination tonight and stop at a convenience store about 31 minutes away according to Google maps which will be about an hour at my pace.

That is to say, there's a convenience store about 60 m wrong direction from which way I want to go so I'm not going to go there.  I will instead walk 2.4 km the correct direction so as to not waste steps.
