Googoo is the sound of an empty stomach and of deep sleep.
So what better name to use for a restaurant and guest house?

Located just two minutes apart by foot, Googoo Restaurant and
Googoo Guest House are a delicious and clean combo for
Italian food and place to sleep off the meal and ample drinks.

Daisuke and Hiroe are also backpackers,
heading for months long adventures in different places around the world.
We have some overlap in South America and Rapa Nui.

While writing this entry, I got another full glass of umeshu.
And they have ice cream...  Yikes stripes! Will I wake up in time tomorrow?

Oh my goodness, they picked up my tab at the restaurant.  So generous!

Daisuke had said 遊び来てね！ and that 遊び is what made me think it would be
worth it to take my tired butt over there.  So worth it indeed!  We had great
conversations about travel and he asked world-traveler type questions,
including "what prompted you to stay in Japan?"

Really super best of alll the places I have stayed.
Apa was 3700 cheap and impersonal.
Googoo was just 5000 yen and included dinner and
hours of great friendly conversation!
