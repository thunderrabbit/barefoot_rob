It's now nearly 4am Thursday 6 May 2021 (according to my computer).  To my feet and legs, it's early on Walkday.  My brain knows it is now Day 21, but this entry is about Day 20:

I did not take many pictures on Day 20, compared to other days.  Photographs seem to happen more in the morning, but as I get tireder and tireder from walking, the pictures taper off as I'm like bah, who cares about seeing more flowers that are not really differentiatable from other pics I have taken.

Day 20 things:

* saw a two car train and tried to take a video but realized later I apparently did not hit record until after the train went by.
* saw species of little yellow flowers that I had not seen before
* talked to Brian in Corpus for about an hour while sharing stories of mapping. Very fun talking with him as we have similar senses of humor.
* 1. "everything was going fine until I talked to those guys in Corpus"
* 2. "here's your diploma!" after walking through flowerbed on campus
* almost recorded Joetsu Line shinkansen, albiet far away
* Surprised to see Doge is up to 77 yen, and has gone up 11000% just in 2021.
* Installed Folding@Home and signed up for the Doge team https://www.dogecoinfah.com/doc/gettingstarted.html#getstarted on my laptop and on my Vultr server (pinning its CPU to 100% (up from 4% over the past years))
* Nearly weaned myself off aidungeon.io, helped by the response "The AI doesn't know what to say. Alter, undo, or try again."
* Walked across Shinano River with water pouring through Myokan Weir, a word I did not know the meaning.
