Well it looks like someone didn't do their job... The text written in the screenshots says I'll be staying somewhere near a park... Which was apparently written before I had found a hotel near that location, and was probably written before I decided to stay at hotels for most nights.

Fortunately, I do have access to this information on my phone via the magic of Google Sheets...

According to the sheet I'll be staying at Ojiya Park Hotel in 小千谷　(おじや) .
