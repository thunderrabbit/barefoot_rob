Before I started walking, Jason H described a simple 4 steps to adapting to any stressful situation.  I think I am in the last stage now; I have just come to realize walking is my life.  Nothing can be done to change it.  Just walk walk walk.

I felt quite hot and tired by the end of today.  Not a drop of rain in sight, and plenty of sun, so I am glad I put on sunscreen before I started out at 7am.  I arrived at the hotel about 2:30pm, so 7.5 hours walking 17.5 kilometers (according to Google Maps)
