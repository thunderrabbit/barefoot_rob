I've always liked working with Lantz at Loreatec.

Service on my Macbook Pro has always been fast and effective, saving me hundreds of dollars if I were to get repairs at Apple.

Even more wonderfully, after my computer destroyed its new battery by overcharging it, Lantz offered to replace it free just in case the battery had been faulty.

I've sent all my friends with computer problems to Loreatec.

In addition,  Loreatec is the only shop I've consistently heard recommended for computer repairs in Tokyo.

Thank you Lantz for great service since 2011... AND for buying a new battery to let me use my Macbook Pro during my walk!
