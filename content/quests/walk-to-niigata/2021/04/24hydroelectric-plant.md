I saw this from the side as I approached.  Woah something interesting going on here!

Here is the exit from the back side

Ah! It's from a power plant.  Hydroelectric plant yay!

Coming closer to the plant, looks like there is more frothy action around the corner

oh sweet! Water pours down into the little river from something above it..

audio transcript:

I found a what I believe to be an electrical power plant that hydro
Electric plant and I described the water pouring off of us like a
small river pouring that cascading into a bigger river as like 10
bathtubs per second worth of water. And I don't know, what was a more
common unit of measure and I guess, cubic meters per second in Japan
is it's usually cubic feet per second in the US, maybe yards per
second anyway. I measured it and and estimated it to be 10 bathtubs
per second. pouring from the small river into a big river. I took a
lot of pictures with with my old phone then I was like, Oh, I have
this cool camera. So I went and took photos with the cool camera of
this area as well. And so kind of did a little backtracking. But
anyway, I took a bunch of photos, I really enjoyed seeing the area and
taking lots of photos, even though no one else in the area seemed to
care about it anymore. Because they had already seen it. But um, there
weren't a lot of people in the area, but a few so that was that was a
cool thing. And I wonder if I can find where that was on the map.
