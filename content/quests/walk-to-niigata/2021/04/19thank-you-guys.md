I happen to see some kids walking home from school I guess.. they were curious about my lack of shoes and my shirt so ask some questions to get details about my plan.

I asked if anyone would like to take a picture and though I heard A chorus of five or so voices say yes, only two actually join me for the picture.

Thank you, courageous two!
