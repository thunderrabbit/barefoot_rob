#### Feeling

Feeling great right now, and just discovered that I already created a
way to generate updates using a Perl script.

#### Recently

Phone died yesterday afternoon; ended up taking today sans walking as
a result.  Printed maps at 7-11 and plan to use them tomorrow to walk.

#### Now

Lin is resting beside me and noted tomorrow is going to be a bit of a
long day walking.  I am grateful for my day off today! (Day 10)

#### Coming up

Tomorrow will be a 20km day through the foothills(?) and/or mountains.
Yikes stripes am I ready for this?
