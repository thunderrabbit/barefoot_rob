[![2021 apr 15 this much more to pack tomorrow morning](//b.robnugen.com/quests/walk-to-niigata/2021/en_route/day-01/thumbs/2021_apr_15_this_much_more_to_pack_tomorrow_morning.jpeg)](//b.robnugen.com/quests/walk-to-niigata/2021/en_route/day-01/2021_apr_15_this_much_more_to_pack_tomorrow_morning.jpeg)   

Great to chat with Missy while Lin and I pulled together the items on my packing list.  Over about 4 or 5 hours it basically all came together, with some items not making the cut: wet wipes, keyboard, solar panel.

Lin headed to sleep around 12:30am and I fell asleep on the couch for about 30 minutes before taking a shower around 1:30am.

Now it's 2:50am and I'm in bed planning to wake up in 4 hours or so.  Lin and I will arrive at Rinko Park at 9am for walking meditation, then walk home 21km together.

Feeling tired, happy, optimistic.

おやすみ。
