This picture is from when we said bye to Clare and Yuumi.

See how the bag looks all crushed and tired?

For my computer's safety I had it up at the top of the bag so it wouldn't get crushed, but it was causing the bag to pull the handle as if to collapse the cart.

Lin had an excellent idea of getting a box to hold most of the heavy stuff, i.e. computer and two blank book diaries.

We bought this box at a home center, with the idea that if it doesn't work then can use it in her office.  It worked well enough for a while but the lid kept getting crushed under the weight of the bag and presumably putting pressure on the computer inside the box.

Now, it looks like we've solved it by going to a heavier duty home center and getting a heavier duty box.

Super thanks to Lin for knowing that that was a heavier duty home center and would have the stuff we need.
