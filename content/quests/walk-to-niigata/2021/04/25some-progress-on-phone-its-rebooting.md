The phone can boot

and reboot

and reboot

and reboot

I found an issue with Android halting when low/no memory so I bought
a new SD card but still have the same issue.  At least I got a good
price on the card.

256GB micro SD with adapter: (5,780 yen + tax) 6,358 yen

Back to phone shop to see if they will make good on the warranty.

They were *not* willing to sort me out with a loaner phone.

At first the reason was they could not contact my local shop via
phone.

Then when we were like "well there are many other shops near Tokyo"
they said they could not give a loaner phone because I am on a 5G
contract and they don't have a 5G phone.

What an incredible reason is that?? Especially given that half the
fuckin' time I look at my phone, it is on 4G because we are in the
middle of no 5G towers.

Just called CSR and they will send a new same model of phone to my
hotel location.  Nice!
