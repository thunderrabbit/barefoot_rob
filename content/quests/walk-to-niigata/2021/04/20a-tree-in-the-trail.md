Just before hanging up with Brian and Gavin in Corpus, I showed them this tree
with reflectors around it.  No reflectors on the tree, and for some reason the
path could not go around the tree.

I am glad this tree was allowed to stay.
I guess this was a cedar forest before roads and paths came through.

Thanks to Mark for showing me how changing the _________ allows different things
to be visible in the photo.  In the bottom photo, I tried to emphasize the reflectors.
