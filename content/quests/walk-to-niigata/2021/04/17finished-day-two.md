Including the rain, day two was super super easy and wonderfully smooth and easy compared to day one.

It started with finishing up packing and that took an hour or so longer than expected, basically because took a while to figure out how to get my boots to sit nicely in the bag.

I tried to do them kind of in a 69 position laying down sideways in the bottom pocket, but they're so big that they caused the bag to kind of contort and not sit straight on its base.

Finally got out the door just after 1:00 p.m. and said bye to the neighbors, Êæ§Áî∞ and ÂçÉÊú¨Êú®, who walked with me and Lin up to the top of our hill.

I got to Yomiuriland by about 3:30pm to hang out with Missy.

Missy and I had a lovely time in Yomiuriland.  There were more employees than guests!

Before I arrived, she rode Bandit, and Looping Coaster (sitting down).

We watched the sea lions with two other people in the aquatheater,

then rode Bandit, getting to sit in the front seat because there was no one else in line.

I use the front seat opportunity to take a video of Fran√ßois on the ride.

We then road looping coaster four times consecutively, twice standing, and twice sitting. For me, the sitting version is a little bit more challenging due to more apparent Gs as we are further from the center of the loop.

I forgot to take a picture of the giant water slide with the water down to a trickle. The staff turned it on for us when we entered the ride.

Then we went to ride spin coaster, UFO ride, and the VR goggle ride where we put lights on the car beforehand.

Then we rode teacups (as spinny as possible), then Bandit again.  I felt totally bumped around on Bandit the second time compared to the first.  Two main differences I noted: we were in the second seat of the car, not the front seat, and we had just gotten sickly dizzy on teacups.

(( It's 23:56pm as I write this mostly using voice transcription with my phone while I'm sitting in the bathtub at the hotel. Good thing the phone is waterproof because I nearly fell asleep and lowered the phone into the bath water. ))

We headed to Shakey's to meet the crew there and I felt really blessed to see everyone.

Lin, Rie, Carl, Michael S, Mizuki, and Fabien were there when Missy and I arrived at the restaurant.

I did some of my infamous food combinations including ice cream and potato salad.

Again for getting to take any photos until Fran√ßois made it out of my pocket.

Super glad that the manager was cool and let us hang out until closing time, even though officially it says we can be there for just 90 minutes.

It's 7:30 we begin leaving, saying goodbye, and a little bit of standing around while I sorted out my backpack from being packed inside a locker.

Then just 8 km gently trudging through the rain and everything was pretty great.

It will probably be dark by the time we leave Yomiuriland,
so I doubt we will be able to see much near Tama River.  
But we'll cross Tama River and then walk a bit to Chuokan Hotel.
