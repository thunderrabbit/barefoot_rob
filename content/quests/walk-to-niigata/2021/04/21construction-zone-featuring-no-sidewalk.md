I came up to a section where the sidewalk was missing...

And I was able to make my way through it even with the construction worker guys there.

I didn't get a picture of that, but I did get to discover just how hot fresh poured asphalt can be.

Also got a chance to take a picture of François on rabbit shaped barrier holders.

And then the most amazing thing is finding this new manhole cover it hasn't even had its plastic taken off yet...

Here it is in context with the sidewalk ripped out around it
