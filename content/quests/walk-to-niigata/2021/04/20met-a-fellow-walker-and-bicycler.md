[![2021 apr 19 fellow walk and bicycle](//b.robnugen.com/quests/walk-to-niigata/2021/en_route/day-05/thumbs/2021_apr_19_fellow_walk_and_bicycle.jpeg)](//b.robnugen.com/quests/walk-to-niigata/2021/en_route/day-05/2021_apr_19_fellow_walk_and_bicycle.jpeg)   

He said he has bicycled from here to niigata and he knew the exact mileage.   

He's also biked or hiked in Iran and other countries I didn't recognize the names of.
