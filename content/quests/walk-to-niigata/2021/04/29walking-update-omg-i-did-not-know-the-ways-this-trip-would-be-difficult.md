I had a good cry this morning with Shraddhan on our daily call.

* callous on my right foot despite wearing sandals
* long-ass walk yesterday 6 hours through the hills after 2 hours on the highway
* crying last night because I could not figure out how to put together my futon
* sandals ripping almost apart yesterday
* not able to find the photo I took yesterday
* not getting the photo I wanted (and basically too late to go back)
* and it's raining today
