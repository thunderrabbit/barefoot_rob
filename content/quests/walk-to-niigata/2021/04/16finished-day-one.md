( this is being written 12 hours after the datestamp )

Arrived home last night at 22:05, super sluggish, barely able to drag self up and down the stairs.  The first few times I went down, I walked backwards because my legs could not handle going forward down the stairs.

So so grateful for Lin joining me and sorting out the luggage issue.

Here was the plan for the day...  we pretty much stuck to it as there was not a lot of detail.  We left Rinko park 50 minutes later than I had kinda planned in my mind, and it was time well-spent with people chilling and hanging out.

Shraddhan joined Lin and I for a significant portion of the walk..  3 hours I think.  Super great to talk to him and see him and Lin chatting as I struggled with gear or walking.

Also great that Lin drives the route a lot so knew exactly how to get home.  All in all a 10/10 day!
