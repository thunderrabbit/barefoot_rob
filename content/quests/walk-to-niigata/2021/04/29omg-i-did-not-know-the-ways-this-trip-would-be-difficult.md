I had a good cry this morning with Shraddhan on our daily call.

* callous on my right foot despite wearing sandals
* long-ass walk yesterday 6 hours through the hills after 2 hours on the highway
* crying last night because I could not figure out how to put together my futon
* sandals ripping almost apart yesterday
* not able to find the photo I took yesterday
* not getting the photo I wanted (and basically too late to go back)
* and it's raining today
* camera could not use 32MB card

Plan for yesterday was

<!-- 25 March 2021: WALK SEGMENT SEPARATOR  ===========  TO HELP ME SEE AND EDIT SEGMENT DETAILS -->
<div class="walk-segment">

* Day <span class="day_source">Thirteen</span>
(<span class="day_date">Wednesday April 28th</span> *)
1 part:
<br>
Walk <span class="km_source">14</span>km,
From [Sports Inn Fujiya](https://goo.gl/maps/jXdUYeUBKoghTaQ78)
To [Family House Akashiya](https://goo.gl/maps/Cs43KenXgvZJVFoT8)
(<span class="km_total">217</span>km walked so far)

Will use:

* [Shinmikunio Bridge](https://goo.gl/maps/qBT5vo9Xu1GCvPs6A)

Will *not* use:

* [tunnels](https://goo.gl/maps/fvxS6g6ys3iLmdMs8)!

Notice the tunnels on Highway 17 (Mikuni Highway), south of [Obansanja Shrine](https://goo.gl/maps/FPMimFRj2ETNoCj3A).  Along 17, I will take a [trail starting here](https://goo.gl/maps/eRdo2j5maUF2EdpM9), hike *around* the tunnels, past [Obansanja Shrine](https://goo.gl/maps/yyt6VTDutJXz9htm7), and [finish the trail here](https://goo.gl/maps/2LChPf3Uo6w7HVxK7).

You may notice there is another [tunnel looking thing, but it has a sidewalk](https://goo.gl/maps/6apj5cUHDrySQp4z9) next to it.
