Of all the things I did not expect to put a pause in my walk: phone
not working is pretty high on the list.

I had literally just used it to record a video in the middle of Bando
Bridge and then when I tried to check the map at the other side of the
bridge, my phone didn't come on.

As per our plan, Lin and I met at Sky Terme Shibukawa.

I had hoped that would be the big news!!  Lin and I met!

NOT per plan, I rode with her to the hotel for tonight.

So I walked *roughly* from Yokohama to Sky Terme Shibukawa

147 kilometers according to Google Maps

Hopefully we can get a new handset tomorrow; if not I will go try to
print maps of next and next and next destinations.
