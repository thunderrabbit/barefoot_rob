Yay just arrived in Yumotokan. The host said the onsen is very hot.

Lots of pics on the way here, but first wash feet, contact Jason, maybe have dinner with him.

Oh, maybe I can start them uploading...  oh but I want to name the photos.

I can pop them up to cloud and deal with them "later", hopefully sooner!
