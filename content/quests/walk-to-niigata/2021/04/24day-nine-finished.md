As of yesterday, Lin planned to meet me at Sky Terme Shibukawa (super sento (public bath)).  She did that, but then *drove* me to the hotel because my phone died and I wanted to get it resolved as quickly as possible.  Phone shop is closed until tomorrow (and booked until May), but we will try to get in tomorrow and get a replacement handset.

Anyway, about today, the sento was nice, not huge, but has a great view, being 5 stories above green fields.  Nice open air deck.
