After my phone died, I was already pretty close to Sky Terme Shibukawa
so was able to walk sans phone from Bando Bashi to Sky Terme Shibukawa
with the help of locals pointing the way.

As of yesterday, Lin planned to meet me at Sky Terme Shibukawa (super
sento (public bath)).  She did that, but then *drove* me to the hotel
because my phone died and I wanted to get it resolved as quickly as
possible.  Phone shop is closed until tomorrow (and booked until May),
but we will try to get in tomorrow and get a replacement handset.

Anyway, about today, the sento was nice, not huge, but has a great
view, being 5 stories above green fields.  Nice open air deck.
