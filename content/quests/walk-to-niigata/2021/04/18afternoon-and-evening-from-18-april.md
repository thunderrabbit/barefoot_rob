After this cute picture, 3 hours of painful walking on super incredibly rough asphalt.

It took 3 hours to walk the final 3 - 4 km tonight, about 40 minutes of which was streamed on Instagram. https://www.instagram.com/tv/CNzWG5aHelC/

It was quite dark in some sections, and I looked for my headlamp but could not work out where it was. I wore sandals for about 300 meters near the end of the 3km because it got dark and dangerous and I couldnâ€™t see what I was stepping on. I took shoes off again once I got to an area with lights.

In other news, I lost the lens cap of my new camera. Any camera shops near here? Mark is going to try to source a replacement.
