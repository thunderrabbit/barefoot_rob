After standing at the train line for a while and getting pictures of Fran√ßois while next to the trains as they went by the broken fence, I discovered that one of the crossings nearby was for a very small path crossing the tracks.

Getting semi sort of close to Yasaka Station, I found a bunch of beer cans dumped by a vending machine.

Upon closer inspection, I discovered they were milk tea!

Around 4:30 p.m. I stepped on something sharp enough to cause my foot to bleed.

Around 4:50pm, after lugging my baggage down about 20 steps I discovered
this gate was closed.  

It took a long time to walk around the outside part and I never actually
walked to the open area near the entrance for walking meditation.

In Family Mart, I bought chicken, salad, cold corn soup and banana jelly.

#### 8pm or so

It took 3 hours to walk the final 3 - 4 km tonight, about 40 minutes of which was streamed on Instagram.  https://www.instagram.com/tv/CNzWG5aHelC/

It was quite dark in some sections, and I looked for my headlamp but
could not work out where it was. I wore sandals for about 300 meters
near the end of the 3km because it got dark and dangerous and I couldn't see
what I was stepping on.  I took shoes off again once I got to an area with lights.

In other news, I lost the lens cap of my new camera.  Any camera shops near here?
Mark is going to try to source a replacement.

I checked in to the hotel and the desk clerk spoke English pretty well.
We talked about the increasing suicide rate in young women in Japan,
and he made the claim that poverty should be illegal.

I didn't debate him on that point.  We talked about how the
"Federal" Reserve Bank is a privately owned company.
