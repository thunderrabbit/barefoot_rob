I enjoyed seeing these flowers of three different colors.

As I was uploading the picture, the owner came home and was like
「なにあっての？」 ("'fuck are you doing?'")

「花がきれいと思ったから写真をとった。」("I thought the flowers were nice so I took a picture")

He walked into his house with a huff and not another word.

Sorry to have disturbed him.
