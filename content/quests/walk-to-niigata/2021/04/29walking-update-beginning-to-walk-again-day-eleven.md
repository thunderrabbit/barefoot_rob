Good morning from みどりの村キャムプ場, which has a pretty nice setup
of bungalows and such.  Not much food in the camp area, but a coveni
is outside the property.

Feelings slightly nervous about engaging the mountains.  it's definitely colder here, and apparently 10 degrees C at the place I will be for *tomorrow* night.

Regarding the phone saga, they will send a new phone to the place I will be
Tuesday night.

Mountains and hills coming soon to a walk near me!

Now it's time to pack!!
