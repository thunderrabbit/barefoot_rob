Let me just first say I am tired / not wanting to get moving today.   Spirits are a bit low; I seem to have lost my preferred foot cream (prescription ointment), and while looking through my bag found things I have not used yet.  KUMON book and Way of the Peaceful Warrior (volume 3).

I knew the trip would be tough, so continuing to move.  I think the honeymoon stage is ending and getting into hostile territory (yikes stripes!).

* honeymoon
* hostile
* humor
* home

Four stages of adaptation to new challenge (as offered by Jason when he gave me the Deep Blue, which has been amazing; thank you!)
