I was intrigued + amazed + happy to see how strong the snow barriers are.

And found a section of triangles through which I could walk quite happily

Day 15 was

<div class="walk-segment">

* Day <span class="day_source">Fifteen</span>
(<span class="day_date">Friday April 30th</span> *)
1 part:
<br>
Walk <span class="km_source">6</span>km,
From [Lodge Montoze](https://goo.gl/maps/RHXs15jPyHPNVPyX6)
To [Kagura White Horse Inn](https://goo.gl/maps/jxFH8Yjw76n3e4dh8)
(<span class="km_total">233</span>km walked so far)

There is a tunnel on Highway 17
just north of Lodge Montoze,
through which I can ~~not~~ safely walk
~~because~~ though there are no sidewalks.  
One of my skiing friends said
there will likely be very few skiers
by this date, so I can ~~likely
use the ski slopes to the west
of the tunnel, possibly using
Tashiro Ropeway.~~

I prefer walking if possible,
but we shall see exactly
what *is* possible!

Update 30 April 2021:  Owner of Montoze Lodge said
there is no reasonable way to go around the mountain.
Must go through the tunnel.
Be careful or he will give us a ride.

We were careful and had a [great time finding a whole magical world](/quests/walk-to-niigata/2021/04/30found-a-secret-door-out-of-tunnel/).
