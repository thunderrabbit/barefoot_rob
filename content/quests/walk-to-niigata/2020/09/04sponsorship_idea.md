Today at Christine's birthday party, Petya suggested a great idea for
sponsoring my trip.  "For every 10km walked, ______ will
donate one pair of shoes to _____."

The blanks still have to be filled in, and I guess it is only 33 pairs
of shoes which seems small, so maybe every 1km walked??  Or "for each
person who walks 10 km."

Also at Christine's birthday party, Johnny said he would love to
interview me for his podcast!  Awesome!  Now I am like "ahhh!" cause
there is not yet a domain to send people to, and no site really
talking about it.  Is /quests on my site enough?

I guess it's okay to say "Rob Nugen dot com slash quests"
