I was thinking about some ways to kind of promote the trip with
cards or a story answering "why Niigata?" (because my shirt says Niigata.)

Maybe selling shirts if you want to buy a shirt too and maybe building
community interest, asking "where should the next trip be?" that kind
of thing. Inviting local people to join for a segment as they are
interested.


I need to finish planning each part of the route, like each day of the
trip. I need to start laying out the days so I know where I'm going to
go each day and have enough time for community feedback on those plans
as well, so one first step is to get the maps up on my website.

Maybe I can put up a areamap image of the overall route and maybe have
each section be its own clickable zone or something.
