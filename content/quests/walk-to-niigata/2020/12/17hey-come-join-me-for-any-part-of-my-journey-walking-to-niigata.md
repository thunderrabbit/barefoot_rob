Starting April 13th 2021, I plan to walk from my house in [Kawasaki to
Niigata station, 300 kilometers away](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1ccCdmHbV1RTwKH9qKbBe531jRQ3Bsf2F&usp=sharing)!

The trip should be doable: 300km over 3 weeks = less than 15km per
day.

The start date is (still / only) a few months away and my brain has
been swamped with ideas,plans,complications,fears,etc so in order to
simplify all of that, I will just say

**Hey!  Come join me for any part of my journey walking to Niigata!**

Share with your friends as I want to meet as many people as possible
along the way!

I've found several neat places I want to visit; do you know of others
along this route?

If you cannot join during the actual walk, thank you for supporting my
GoFundMe campaign for this walk. (link coming soon!)

Visit my webpage https://www.robnugen.com/quests/ for the latest updates,
including a map of the plan so far.

These are [my planned rest stops along the way](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1ccCdmHbV1RTwKH9qKbBe531jRQ3Bsf2F&usp=sharing), so please forward to
your friends who live in the route.  Maybe we can meet along the way
to enjoy a cup of tea!

No one knows what will happen while walking from Kawasaki to Niigata
so the planned points certainly may change!

Thank you Jason and everyone for your support!  I look forward to
seeing you on the walk!
