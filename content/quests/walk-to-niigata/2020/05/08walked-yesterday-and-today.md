I have begun to walk again in the mornings.  I have posted on FB my
idea of walking to Niigata.  I have begun to plot out some potential
waypoints for the route.

So far, I have plotted waypoints for 5+ hours to walk to Seibuen Amusement Park

Seibuen Amusement Park to Tennenonsen Kachofugetsu Hot Spring via
Miyamae Park, nico rico, and 5 other stops in Google Maps.

Tennenonsen Kachofugetsu Hot Spring to 鳩山町文化会舘 via Ikejiriike
Park, Takakurakofuku Temple, and 6 other stops in Google Maps.

鳩山町文化会舘 to 薪石窯PIZZA たんぽぽ via Kamigarako, Kamigarako, and
3 other stops

薪石窯PIZZA たんぽぽ to Niigata Station via Lockheart Castle and
Prefectural Gunma Observatory

Though I have decided to not stop at Lockheart Castle, I have not yet
figured out a way to embed maps on my site.  Working on that now.  The
Google maps API allows "only" 20 waypoints on a map.
