There were some signs of how they are dealing with COVID-19

I plan to visit the hot springs near Yomiuriland on April 13th, 2021.

I just noticed this wall near two big old trees that surrounded an
entrance to a house that has been torn down.

Lots of ads for some sort of community center, I think
