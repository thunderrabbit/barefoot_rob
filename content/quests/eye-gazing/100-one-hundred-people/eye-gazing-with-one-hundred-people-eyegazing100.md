June 5th, 2021 (土) I plan to go to Shibuya to offer
[Free Eye Gazing](/events/2021/06/05free-eye-gazing-near-shibuya-crossing/)
with anyone who is interested.  I don't guess that I will connect with 100 people tomorrow,
but I can certainly put the word out and connect with that many over
the month of June, I imagine.

Gather online `#eyegazing100`
