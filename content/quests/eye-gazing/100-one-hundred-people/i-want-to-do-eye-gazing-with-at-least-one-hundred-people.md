Tomorrow I plan to go to Shibuya to offer [Free Eye Gazing](/events/2021/06/05free-eye-gazing-near-shibuya-crossing/) with people
who are willing to try.  I don't know that I will connect with 100 people tomorrow,
but I can certainly put the word out and connect with that many over
the month of June, I imagine.
