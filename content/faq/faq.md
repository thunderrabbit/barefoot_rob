## FAQ

### Why is Rob Barefoot?

Rob is barefoot because he likes to be barefoot. He has spent 17 years of his life this way. Rob was embarrassed at first and can remember curling his toes to try to hide the fact that he was barefoot in a public setting.

    “I encourage people to not worry so much and just do what they want to do.
    Me being barefoot is not hurting anyone else and I enjoy it, so I choose to stay barefoot.

    Do you like to wear hats?  Wear hats.  Do you like to sing? Sing. 
    Don’t let embarrassment or public stigmas stop you from feeling joy.
    If you are not hurting anyone else and it brings you happiness, then go for it.”
