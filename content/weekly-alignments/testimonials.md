    It was really interesting. I was really able to pin point a moment
    when I was hurt by my dad. It also explains why I have been
    craving his validation for most of my life. My mind is kind of
    blown right now.

    I watched it with my new friend. We started to cry during your
    guided meditation.  It was a beautiful moment for us. Because of
    your session, we could easily allow each other to be
    vulnerable. We ended up hugging, crying and sharing how we can
    support each other to integrate another version of ourselves - who
    have all the deepest desires met - into our current lives.  Thank
    you for unlocking another way to liberate myself, also introducing
    a way to deeply connect with /understand people I care for.
