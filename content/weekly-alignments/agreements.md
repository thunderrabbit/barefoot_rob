1. I desire to participate in online or in person groups as part of
   Weekly Alignments&trade;.
2. My participation is voluntary. I acknowledge that I am not
   obligated to participate in any activity or exercise and can sit
   out anytime.
3. I hereby agree to treat every participant with the utmost respect
   in all my interactions and to keep anything that is said or shared
   in the confidential space of Weekly Alignments&trade; 100% private,
   confidential, and anonymous.

   sexual relationship that a reasonable person would consider to be
   exploitative.
5. Weekly Alignments&trade; provides an experiential, educational
   program, which may involve physical, emotional and psychological
   activity, and in cases of such activity there is always a risk
   involved. I understand that in a group workshop setting, the
   instructor(s) are not responsible for monitoring physical,
   emotional and psychological limits, or the limits of other
   participants, and that I am therefore responsible for assessing the
   risk any individual or group activity poses to me, and choosing a
   safe course of action for myself.

   injuries or damages suffered by me arising out of my participation
   in all Weekly Alignments&trade; events.

   design or claim, nor is not a substitute for medical treatment,
   psychotherapy, or any state-certified health program.
8. Weekly Alignments&trade; organization specifically advises that
   Weekly Alignments&trade; Leaders are trained facilitators, not
   psychological professionals.
9. I hereby fully and completely waive and release Weekly
   Alignments&trade; and all respective representatives, leaders,
   teachers, directors, officers, and employees from any and all
   actions, claims, demands, damages and liability for personal
   injuries or damages, which has resulted or may hereinafter result,
   arising, directly or indirectly, from my participation in Weekly
   Alignments&trade; events.
10. I acknowledge that I am voluntarily assuming all risks associated
    with my participation in Weekly Alignments&trade; events and
    voluntarily agree to accept any and all risks of injury or death.


### Guidelines ###

1. No drugs or alcohol. If you are high or have been drinking, tell
   the group. Honor this sacred space.
2. If you judge another person, notice how these judgements are about
   yourself.
3. We do our best to use I Statements, not You/We statements. When we
   take responsibility for our language we can take responsibility for
   ourselves.
4. Ask another member before you give feedback.  They may say no.
5. Feedback is a reflection on what you heard/saw/felt, and is focused
   on the one who is sharing. Opinions and Advice are only given if
   requested.
6. Let the group leader know if you cannot arrive on time.
