We meet 7pm - ~8:30pm JST, every Thursday **except 5th Thursdays of a month.**

Here is the first month plan, starting November 26th, 2020:

* Nov 26th: Interactive look at life from outside of Time.  We will move in and
  out of different locations in our (life)time-space continuum

* Dec 3rd: Who are we without our past self or future self?  What opportunities
  does this awareness offer?

* Dec 10th: Listening to our Self in realtime.  How do we stay connected to
  higher self voice when things are going awry?

* Dec 17th: What parts of ourselves can we release as we go into 2021?  What
  will we have to give up?  What can we gain?

* Dec 24th: What have we learned from 2020?  How will we show up for
  ourselves from now onward?

* Dec 31st: (no session on 5th Thursdays)  Be well!

Going forward, the curriculum will adjust based on attendee questions
and input.  Lots of clarity and positive energy assured!
