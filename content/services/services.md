## ðŸ‘‡ Personal Sessions ðŸ‘‡

Get customized private confidential listening from the heart.  In our sessions, express yourself freely to release stress and find your inner calm.   Customized meditation sessions help you remember who you are.  Receive a recording of our sessions so you can listen again anytime.

Learn how to communicate even while experiencing emotional energy.  This allows you to improve relationships with your partner and others.

Let go of past problems to give yourself the freedom to recreate yourself each day.

## ðŸ‘‡ Weekly Alignments ðŸ‘‡

[Weekly Alignments](/weekly-alignments/) offer tools you can use anytime to get you present with your Self.

At the end of each weekly session, I do a live facilitation to help
someone get clarity about or even overcome an issue in their life.

Weekly Alignments include channeled material coming from
Source as I receive it in realtime, depending on questions and
comments from the attendees present.
