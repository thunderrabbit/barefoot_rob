                        <p>So long as I do stuff within a normalized range, no one really cares
what I do.</p>

<p>I can spend all day trying to figure out one bug, or ignore it.  No
one will know the difference.  I could even quit my job, and just a
few people will notice.  (some people very much so, but 99+% will
not)</p>

<p>Re-reading the above sounds like I am suicidal, but I am not.  My
point is quite exactly the opposite.</p>

<p>I can wear shoes or not, and no one cares.  But I care.  I <em>love</em>
being barefoot 99% of the time, and am working toward doing it more.</p>

<p>I can work on Marble Track 3 or not; no one cares.  But I care!  I
<em>love</em> the project; I love talking about it, I love its steady
progress building up to something over time. I love the ridiculousness
of it; I love people&rsquo;s incredulous reactions when I say 1 second of
video took 2 hours to make (and it&rsquo;s going to be a lot higher, tbh..
2 hours per second is just for a <em>silent</em> video!)</p>

<p>I can stop doing workshops and no one cares..  But I care!  I did the
eye gazing workshop and it was great!</p>

<p>For some reason I have had (and still have) this fear that I cannot do
anything <em>different</em> from what I have been doing before, but this is
simply not true!  How untrue is it?</p>

<p>Just this past weekend I did stand a few minutes of up comedy for the
first time (with no prior practice nor planning) and it was fine; it
was easier than I expected.  I could do that, (or not, and no one
cares,) but I don&rsquo;t want to do that.</p>

<p>I want to put together a Silent Football game, though Rin has
recommended I focus on my Barefoot Rob brand first, but I don&rsquo;t wanna!
What should I do?  ergg this is so confusing.</p>

<p>Instead of being frustrated, can I instead see the steading progress
forward like on Marble Track 3?</p>

<p>This is an age-old question, and the answer seems to be it does not
really matter; just do what I want to do!</p>

<p>I put a question mark on the title because I cannot really prove the
visions are related to past lives, but this is a fun way to guide
people through a process to see what could be their past lives.</p>

<pre><code>Each participant gets into a relaxed position, usually either
sitting in a chair, or laying down, or otherwise sitting against
something comfortable.

Spend a few minutes leading the participants through a relaxation
process, whereby they let their bodies relax and keep their minds
awake.  Once they are in this mind awake / body asleep mode,
invite them to imagine getting up and leaving the room.  Guide
them to imagine traveling far away, whether by vehicle, or through
a cave, or through a forest, or by any other means which takes
them from the familiar, to the unfamiliar, and guide them to
arrive somewhere new, yet familiar.

Give the participants a chance to explore the familiar area,
including seeing other inhabitants of the area and moving around
and communicating with them.

Once they have explored the area, lead the participants gently
back the way they came, allowing them to have a clear memory of
what happened and what they heard and saw. (say things like
&quot;coming back slowly, you clearly remember what you experienced,&quot;
etc) Once their awareness focuses back on their physical bodies,
give them a chance to write down what they experienced.  Do not
speak until everyone is pretty much done writing.

The whole process is a state of light hypnosis, and everyone will
still have full control and awareness of where their physical body
is.  They will be able to come back in a moment's notice if they
choose.

Each process will take about 20 or 30 minutes.

                        <p>Growing up, we are taught various things in order to guide us toward
being a fully functioning adult.  Some of the messages we got as
children do not serve us as adults (and some didn&rsquo;t serve us a
children!) so affirmations are an easy way to help retrain our brain
to have positive messages rolling through.</p>

<p>I had heard of affirmations many times before, but my
<a href="https://feelonenesslove.com">coaching sessions with Rin</a> really
helped me see the value of affirmations.  Rin helped me uncover some
of the messages that were unconsciously reverberating in my mind, and
helped me write messages that would serve me instead of keep me
stagnant.</p>

<p>Some of them were basic, and would probably serve most people.</p>

<pre><code>&quot;I love myself&quot;
&quot;I accept myself&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Some others were more specific to me and my situation.</p>

<pre><code>&quot;I smile freely&quot;
&quot;I love expressing myself&quot;
&quot;People are interested in what I have to say&quot;
&quot;It’s safe to express who I am&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Some came from intuition and memory.</p>

<pre><code>&quot;My heart is connected to my abundance&quot;
&quot;I have plenty of work I love&quot;
&quot;I trust the world&quot;
&quot;I trust my guidance&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>I have affirmations listed in my daily R.O.B.O.T. pages, and just
recently moved one to the top:</p>

<pre><code>&quot;I smile freely&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>and added a ringer</p>

<pre><code>&quot;God dwells in me as me.&quot;

<p>The Law of Attraction is real, but maybe not in the way you&rsquo;ve heard
portrayed.  &ldquo;Think of something and it comes to you&rdquo; brings to mind
people thinking of a new fancy car, but still not see it in their
driveway so assume LoA is a LoAd of Hooey.</p>

<p>But let&rsquo;s go to a more subtle level.  In the same way that
<a href="/blog/2019/07/08/my-focus-matters/">my focus matters</a>, I tend to
bring experiences to myself based on my intention or attention.
Focusing on the good parts of my day allows me to see more good parts
to my day, and keeps me in a happier state of mind.</p>

                        <p>Have you ever found yourself flying like a bird, only to later realize
it was a dream?</p>

<p>Have you been chased by &ldquo;bad guys&rdquo; or haunted by scary situations in
your dreams?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lucid dreaming&rdquo; is a state of dreaming while being aware that you are
dreaming.  Lucid dreaming allows me to have more fun flying dreams and
fewer scary dreams.  This is how I got started:</p>

<p>There are a few techniques I have used at different times of my life.</p>

<ol>
<li>Start a dream journal.  Prepare a notebook and pen, and leave it
next to you when you go to sleep.  Immediately upon waking, write
down <em>anything</em> that you can recall.  A sketch, a sentence, even a
single drawn line or single word can help.  This process of writing
or drawing helps connect your waking conscious mind with your
dreaming mind.</li>
</ol>

<p>Do this consistently over some weeks or months and you will soon
   have more to write than you possibly have time for upon waking.</p>

<ol>
<li>Check to see if you are dreaming.  There are several different ways
to do so.  Do one or more of these tests throughout the day, like
every hour or so.  Eventually you will do a test while dreaming
and find yourself lucid dreaming!</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Test 1</em>: Read this sentence.  Read it again.  Close your eyes for a
   few seconds.  Open your eyes and read it again.  Did it change?
   No?  Then you are probably not dreaming.</p>

<p>Did the sentence change?  Then you are dreaming.  Congratulations!</p>

<p><em>Test two</em>: Stand up.  Look up toward a point way up above you and
   jump to it.  Did you come back down?  Then you are probably not
   dreaming.</p>

<p>Did you stay in the air or fly to that point?  You are
   dreaming!</p>

<p><em>Test three</em>: Count your fingers.  Count them again.  Do you have the
   normal number?  Can you do it easily?  You are probably not
   dreaming.</p>

<p>Do you have extra fingers than normal?  Fewer fingers than normal?
   Congratulations, you are dreaming!  (Or you may have just had an
   accident.  Call emergency services!)</p>

<p>One other technique I have read is to fall asleep with the intention
of being aware in your dreams.  I personally have not had success with
this technique, but it may work for you.</p>

<p>Do you keep a dream journal?  Do you have any other techniques to
share?  Email me at rob <strong>α𝐭</strong> robnugen.com to let me know!</p>

                        <p>In two weeks I will be leading an Eye Gazing Workshop near Shibuya
station.</p>

<p>To help plan my first workshop, Rin asked me to choose something that
made me really excited.</p>

<p>I told her I would have to think about it, and a couple days later it
suddenly came to me as the perfect workshop.</p>

<p>After determining what I wanted the final outcome to be, the workshop
plan went through a few iterations, with support from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/babay0ga/">Georgie</a>, Mark Wild,
<a href="https://www.yourspeakingjourney.com/">Soness</a>, <a href="https://www.shamanism-asia.com/">Kevin Turner</a>, and others.</p>

<p><a href="https://concreteplayground.com/sydney/event/eye-gazing-2">Georgie has been doing eye gazing workshops for years in Australia.</a></p>

<pre><code>They say our eyes are the window to the soul.  This workshop will give
us a chance to look more deeply into ourselves and more deeply into
those around us.

The process is simple, and the results can be profound.  You may
discover parts about yourself that you didn't know where there.

In this workshop, we will be looking into the eyes of people that we
may never have met before.  We will have a chance to sit with multiple
participants, with a small break in between each person.

It's important to have an intention before each eye gazing practice,
so be sure to have some possible intentions in mind.  Some examples
might be

“I intend to get to know myself better”
“I intend to connect with my intuition”
“I intend to practice acceptance of others”
“I intend to practice acceptance of myself”

Let’s enjoy learning about ourselves and each other.

                        <p>In relationships where everyone is equally able to take care of
themselves, you need to take care of yourself first.  In general, you
are the only person who truly knows what you need, and everyone else
is too busy taking care of themselves to take care of you.</p>

<p>(And to be clear, I am speaking to you, dear reader, not just the
generalized &ldquo;you&rdquo; which really means &ldquo;I&rdquo;.)</p>

<p>Today I learned the value of taking care of myself as related to my
(online) men&rsquo;s group.  Because I had not done my meditation nor my
other morning things, I was not prepared to be in the circle.</p>

<p>In the end, I learned I need to put my own needs above my perceived
&ldquo;needs&rdquo; of the circle.</p>

<p>One man even mentioned that one of the indicators of burnout is the
belief that &ldquo;I am the only one who can do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If you hear that in your life, is it time to evaluate the roles you
have taken in life?</p>

                        <p>When out and about, I like to allow plenty of time between clients so
I can be relaxed while in transit.  Today I took it a step (ha)
further by walking quite slowly.</p>

<p>After slowing myself down physically, I noticed a sense of peace come
over me.  An awareness of joyful awareness like a tautology of being
happy because you&rsquo;re happy.</p>

<p>Time lost its meaning as I simply walked step by step, aware of the
surroundings like being there for the first time.  I was practically
on vacation on my way to work.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s so much to see!  Each leaf on each tree has a story.
Each brick on each wall is unique if you look closely enough.</p>

<p>Walking down a walkway I have been many (!) times before, I noticed
something new that I hadn&rsquo;t seen before.</p>

<p>Each shop has its own design (and they clash like wow)!</p>

<p>What happens for you when you walk slowly and breathe?</p>

                        <p>Where I place the focus my attention makes a difference in how I
experienced my life.</p>

<p>Have you seen the basketball video?  If not, have a look:</p>


<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IGQmdoK_ZfY" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>


<p>If I&rsquo;m in a bad mood I tend to see things that are likewise bad.  If I&rsquo;m
in a good mood I tend to see things that are likewise good.</p>

<p>This causes a natural feedback loop that tends to amplify itself.</p>

<p>So if I&rsquo;m in a bad mood, how do I get myself out of it?  The best way
that I know of this is simply say (or otherwise recognize) &ldquo;this too
shall pass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If I&rsquo;m being squished on the train and can&rsquo;t breathe very well, I
think &ldquo;wow this is my chance to have this experience!  It won&rsquo;t last
forever, and it won&rsquo;t happen exactly like this ever again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If my bare toes get scuffed or squished or bleed due to stubbing a
concrete curb, I think goodness I get to go around barefoot most the
time.  Most curious of all(*), I thank goodness for the chance to wear
shoes so I don&rsquo;t have to worry about my feet being injured.</p>

<p>(* As a positive preventative measure, I thank goodness that my feet
rarely get injured and therefore I go barefoot most of the time
anyway.)</p>

<p>In short, I can choose how I focus on something no matter what the
situation.  If, hypothetically, I were to be yelled at by an
immigration officer for overstaying my visa, I would again focus on
the temporal nature of the moment, and bless the man for doing his
job in the best way he knows how.</p>

<p>Choosing to focus on the positive aspects of things allows me to
experience more of the positive aspects, and therefore have more
positive experience overall.</p>

                        <p>Recently, I have had a big server upgrade that has been challenging me on
how to finish it.  Yesterday I asked a friend of mine if he could
look over my plan for the upgrade.</p>

<p>He agreed, and I began to write the email that articulated my plan.</p>

<p>Just in writing out the email I recalled the value of rubber ducking.</p>

<p>The idea is that you explain the problem to a rubber duck,
giving enough information so that the rubber duck can understand.</p>

<p>(I like to add the idea that rubber duck brains are not very big, so
I need to articulate things in bite-sized pieces.)</p>

<p>In doing this process, I noticed a couple of solutions that will help
me move forward with my plan.  It also helped me get a sense of how
big the project is, and where its steps need to be fleshed out.</p>

<p>Thank you, rubber duck!</p>
