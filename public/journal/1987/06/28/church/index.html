<p class=date>5:10PM Sunday June 28, 1987.</p>

<p>I went to church with Fred.  We went in Ma's car.  Mila, Cheri,
Emily, Me and Fred was there.  I gave Cheri a back massage.
Afterward, Mila drove around a little in Ma's car.  Then she invited
Me over for swimming and lunch.  I called Ma and she said it was cool.
Me and Fred went over there.  We ordered pizza and then swam.  She is
pretty rich.  We swam for a couple of hours then sort of calmed down.
I sat beside Mila for about 15 minutes.  She is a good friend.  Maybe
I will marry her.  If she's into sex, and doesn't smoke, it would be
great.  She likes the song <em>I want your sex.</em> We then decided
it was time to leave.  We hugged, then me and Fred left.  When I got
home I called Kristen, who I met at Astroworld yesterday.  She was mad
and didn't want to talk. I think she's not really mad at me, but she
doesn't want to think about it.  I told her I was sorry that she got
in trouble.  She said, "Ok", like ok, fine just forget it.  I asked
her if she wanted to talk.  She said "no" I said "Ok I'll see you
later" and hung up.  I should have asked if she ever wanted me to call
again.  But I didn't I guess I should just forget about her.  I Won't
call her again.  I don't think she wants me to.  But if she did, she
should have said so.  She'll live.  I'll live.  I Love her.</p>
