                        <p class=note>(transcribed 9:55pm CST Friday 7 February 2003)</p>

<p class=date>Sunday June 14, 1987 10:45PM.</p>

<p>The Rally was excellent!  OK..  I left Friday at about 5:00PM.  I
picked up Dad at his office.  Then he drove us to the church.  When we
got there only Liz Benjamin and official people were there- no youth.
I was looking through the registration forms and I saw Kelly Hugget's
so I thought "It will be great".  Then Aaron and Mike and the rest of
Austin showed up.  "Hey dude" "Yeah" Hugs "Oh, man, how ya doin'?"
Then Baton Rouge came.  I ran to hug Bryn.  So then we started
unloading clothes and food and stuff.  Then Oklahoma people came.
Alisa came in and she was holding some food.  I was gonna be first to
hug her but she sorta pushed on through.  Then someone said, "you can
hug me."  I looked up and it was Kelly!  MMMM Hug Hug Kiss Kiss Oh
<em>baby</em>.  I found out if I hadn't sent the registration forms to
Kelly that all of Tulsa would not have come.  Wow.  After people were
settled, we played some games.  We were swatting a beach ball around.
We played volleyball.  That was fun.  Girls against boys.  That was
when I sorta met Christi.  She is not beautiful, but very pretty.
Hair, eyes, smile.  She reminds me of Irene from Xanth novels.
Slightly spoiled, but that's a bad word for it.  She is firm and
tough (seems to be) she also flirts a lot and seems to know what she
wants.  I Love her.  Some people would think she is an absolute bitch.
She is perfect.  Another thing we did was get lined up by
birthdays. I was between Bryn and Stephanie? (sp?)  Then we divided up
by our signs.  Aires, Taurus, etc.  We made chants for our sign.  Ours
was "Your a hoser, You'll never win.  If your not Arien.  A-I-RES
Never settle for anything less."  In our group:  Me, Shawn, Stephanie,
Karina?  It was cool.  Then we divided up:  Dog lovers here Cat lovers
there.  Each group would huddle and pick a place and a profession.
then we lined up.  One team would take a step forward and say "Here we
come."  The other team would step toward them and say "Where are you
from?"  1st team would say their place.  2nd team "What's your trade"
1st "Lemonade" On the step forward for lemonae, the teams are lined up
facing eachother about 3-5 feet apart.  Then the first team acts out
their profession.  The second team guesses what it is.  When they are
right, 1st team runs back to their base.  2nd team tries to tag them
whoever is tagged switches teams.  Some of the places: East L.A., New
York, Sydney Australia, Idaho, Timbuk2.  Professions:  Firemen,
Librarians, Farmers, Cosmetologists, Tornadoes (mine), Astronauts,
Nothing.  Then we heard the rules and such.  Then Kelly and I went off
to talk.  She found out about bryn.  She also found out about the
ACT.  We talked for a while, then we went to the sancuary.  We were
sitting by the piano.  She played something.  It was nice.  Then we
started Frenching.  My dad walked in after a while.  I about shit.
Not embarassed, just dreading what speech he had in mind for me.  That
is one reason to hate having him as a sponser for us.  And think:
he's going to be the main dude at Bayview for us.  Oh Shit!  I won't
be able to do anything!  But Kelly will be there so... well, back to
Rally.  We went back to the main room. Aaron was dancin'/messin'
around in a room so I went in there.  Shawn, Robin, Christi were
there.  We were talkin', dancin', performing? for a while.  Then I
started giving Kelly a massage.  Robin ripped a piece off her shirt.
Now it's a bracelet of mine.  Robin lay down behind me and I started
giving her one, too.  After a while, I motioned for Aaron to give it
to her.  At about 1:00AM, my dad came in and said I needed to go to
bed.  everyone found out about the ACT at that point.  They all wished
me luck and shit.  Kelly escorted me to the sancuary.  We kissed a
little, then I went to sleep. At about 2:00AM, Bryn and Emily came in
and said I had to take my contacts out.  I didn't fully wake up, but
I was conscious.  Finally they left.  Then dad came in at 7:00 I woke
up and took the dumb test. (easy) I spent about 5 hours away from
everyone.  When I got back, everyone was at the zoo.  We went there
and I found them after a while.  I was recieved with a warm welcome.
That was great.  Truly excellent.  I was with Kelly the whole time at
the zoo.  After a while we all met up front again.  We went to the
museum for lunch.  I rode with Alisa and other people.  Kelly sat on
my lap.  Christi sat beside me.  Oooh La La.  At the museum we at
outside.  We had tortillas and watermelon.  Kelly had a whole bunch
of hot sauce and cheese mixed up on her plate.  I got 1 chip and
scooped it all up and ate it.  She was slightly surprised.  We also
fed a squirell (sp).  Also we played with the aerobee some.  A group
of us went into the museum.  I was with Bryn and Kelly the whole
time.  They were both hanging onto me.  Plus Emily followed me, too.
It looked pretty impressive.  One dude with 3 girls on him.   We saw
everything (It is very changed from the way it used to be.) then
left.  I went back with Karina and Kelly and someone else.  After we
got back, we started preparing for the Love Feast.  Marabian (sp) Love
Feast.  It was great.  A whole lot of food was layed out on four
tables.  Fruit, vegetables, meat, sandwiches.  All was cut into bite
sized pieces.  There were a few rules concerning eating though.  No
forks, knives or spoons.  Just wooden skewers.  Also no talking.  And
you can't feed yourself.  It was great.  Pretty messy, too.  Christi
was tossing grapes up in the air for Aaron and me.  I Love that girl.
Actually we batiked shirts before supper I didn't batik. I just
painted a shirt some.  I couldn't think of anything.  After supper, a
juggler came.  He taught us how to juggle pretty well.  I will learn
how.  After the juggler a lot of people sat on the stage to talk.
Stephanie and Karina were the center of attention.  They told stories
and jokes and stuff.  Then me and Kelly left for a while.  We just
Frenched some.  I gave her a massage.  Then it got very quiet in the
room where everyone had been talking.  We got up to see what was going
on.  Everyone was walking to the sanctuary.  We followed them.  I
don't know what its called, but what we did was fun.  Ok- 2 people
started out talking about something on stage.  Anything.  "Wow this
rollercoaster is fun" or "I can't believe what you did to the car!" or
"I've got you now Darth Vader" <font size="+1">Anything.</font>
Stephanie and Karina started out.  Oh- wait.... Ok 2 people talk about
something.  Then when you get an idea, like they are side by side in
the movies, you say, "Freeze!" Then you go up there and take one of
their places.  And start a new dialouge (sp?): "Hurry, follow that
car!" or "Help! I"m afraid to fly!"  It is a really fun game.  I'll
give some examples of a few that I did:  Two people were sitting
almost face to face. I froze them and went up to them.  They had been
talking about sex.  I said, "Would you hurry up and go.  How are we
gonna play chess if you keep lookin' around?"  Another- They were up
there with linked arms and they other 2 arms in the air.  I froze
them, went up there and said "Rah Rah Rah!"  That one was pretty
funny.  There was one time I was sitting in a chair talking to someone
and Shawn froze it.  He took the other dudes place, "Dad I really want
to be a speed bump." That was hilarious.  I was saying "no no no" Then
my dad came up and took my place, "well if you want to be a speedbump
then you can be one."  Shawn was all "Awww, I don't know, Dad" and my
dad made him lie down and pretended to drive over him to show him what
it would be like.  That was a great game.  After the game, Kelly
dubbed some tapes.  I lay down beside her to wait for dad to go to
sleep.  He finally did, but Kelly wasn't done yet.  So I waited for
her to get done.  She finally did and we went to an empty room.  There
was a big pillow in there.  It was about 2 feet thick in the middle.
It was long enough for me to lay down on it and not hang off the
ends.  And it was wide enough for Kelly to lie down beside
me. Although we were mostly on top of each other.  Actually we just
Frenched for a long time.  10-15 mins.  Then she started
blowing-licking in my ear.  That felt good.  Then I did her.  Then she
did my other ear as I played with her tits.  One time I got a whole
lot of spit on my fingers and started rubbing with that.  Her nipples
got rock hard.  We Frenched some more and more.  Then we sort of fell
asleep together.  That was nice.  Christina woke us up in the
morning.  We got up, cleaned up, signed stuff, got stuff signed, took
pictures, sang songs, hugged, got addresses, gave addresses, hugged,
kissed, hugged, said "Bye" to everyone, and then we left.  I went home
with Dad and Emily.  We got to Northwoods in time for church.  Cheri
and Jenny were not there.  Monday I started writing this entry.  I
also wrote 2 letters - Cheri and Christi - I started Kelly's I
finished Kelly's on Tuesday.  I'm now going to write to Bryn.  Monday
I got <em>It</em> by Stephen King.  I'm on page 172.  We practiced
rifles on Tuesday.  We won't practice again until Tuesday in Two
weeks.  I might go to Ann's house and tell everyone I'm at practice.
I'll have to get my van working right first.  So now it's Wednesday
June 17, 1987 9:25AM.  Later</p>
