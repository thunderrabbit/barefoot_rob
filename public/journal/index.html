                        <p>I chose not to go out to dinner with them to Ninfa&rsquo;s tonight.  Pretty
much super tired and need to sleep, but it may have been good to go so
I would be forced more onto this timezone.</p>

<p>I plan to go buy candles at Kroger, but not sure when I will.</p>

<p>Today went by super slow at first with a bunch of theory, but then
when it got to the practice, everyone was like &ldquo;whoah&rdquo; with questions
and head proverbially spinning.</p>

<p>Super great to see John and Rhonda.</p>

                        <p>This morning during meditation I realized I can do Meetups anywhere in
the world.  Why limit myself to just Tokyo?</p>

<p>Why not lead an eye gazing workshop in Hawaii while I&rsquo;m there?</p>

<p>I am going to go for a walk; I wonder what time the local store
opens.  Probably 7am.</p>

<p>Ma and I chatted while waiting for Nico to arrive and clear customs.
Fun chatting with her and nearly finished solving the latest NYT
crossword puzzle.  I can see how it would be a good way to keep the
ol&rsquo; left brain sharp.</p>

<p>I chatted with the nice driver of the shuttle bus as she drove us to
the IAH parking lot a couple miles away from the airport.  I asked if
she could drive us to Sugarland (an hour away), and she said, &ldquo;just
let me get some gas first..&rdquo;  I love that quick wit!</p>

<p>Ma drove us to Sugarland via Google Maps and then drove us to the
grocery store 600 meters away before heading on her weekend adventure.</p>

<p>Nico and I bought food at the grocery and went through the self
checkout lanes and chatted with the clerk there who had no other
customers.  &ldquo;Are you busy??&rdquo; I jokingly asked her.  I asked her for
the codes on various produce I had bought, but all the items were to
be scanned!  I was like, &ldquo;you kids have it so easy!  When I was a boy
we had to memorize all the codes&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the end, I was like, &ldquo;where&rsquo;s the discount button?&rdquo; and she said
there wasn&rsquo;t one, but if I had a Kroger card, I would get a discount.
Sweet!  Aw man I should have used my card with Nico&rsquo;s checkout as
well; I don&rsquo;t think he got one.</p>

<p>On the way out of the parking lot, I said HI to a woman locking up a nail
salon shop.  I ran up to her, &ldquo;oh please just one more customer??&rdquo; and
she laughed saying she had just come back to get her back pack.</p>

<p>I love that I can banter with clerks here so easily.  Cannot often do
it in Tokyo.</p>

<p>Walked back to the house and now in my own room, with own adjacent bath!</p>

<p>Ma came to the baggage claim area to wait for me!  We took the subway
(subterrainian electric vehicle that ran on rails that looked
relatively light) to the hotel and got some food there.  I marveled at
the size of the portions, <!-- and smiled at Meghan's braces, --> but
there was no in-flight meal so I finished what we ordered.</p>

<p>The veggie burger tasted somewhat like raw meat.  Not sure if I would
have enjoyed it if I thought it was real meat.</p>

<p>Ma and I did some real talk about when she and Dad divorced, so that
was nice.</p>

<p>She told me about a play that Jon is in, where his character actually
sits in the audience and interrupts the play near the end.</p>

<p>That sounds amazing, so I hope I can watch it sometime.</p>

<p>I am tired and writing this while sleepy; I am going to take a shower
and go to bed.  I do not have wifi access yet, so will have to take
care of that in the morning.</p>

<p>Yay Colleen for adulting me safely to the airport!  As we gave huge
hugs at the drop off area, we joked about adulting and I asked her to
let me know if she figures it out!</p>

<p>Great to see a snippet of her life in Seattle.</p>

<p>I wrote bye to Colleen as I was on the jetway, but it did not go
through because apparently no wifi there.</p>

<p>Flight departure prep now.</p>

<p>The in-flight TV system had to be rebooted or something, and it was
neat to watch as each seat&rsquo;s TV got a separate DHCP connection to the
server.  I could see them slowly progressing from front to back of
plane.</p>

<p>There are some sisters on my row (spread across the aisle) and their
mom in seat diagnally in front of me.  Sisters had some sort of hand
signal communication which brought back memories.</p>

<p>This morning Colleen woke me up at 6:40 as I hoped to leave by 7am for
the airport.  I was shocked to know Ryan had already left; I didn&rsquo;t
notice him at all while I was sleeping.</p>

<p>I am grateful that Colleen woke me up after I had not set an alarm or
anything; I was just able to conk out asleep last night and she
handled all the details.</p>

<p>Traffic was super smooth toward the airport and smooth experience from
baggage check-in out on the curb to quite polite TSA agents in through
the gates.  Thank you, SEA-TAC!</p>

<p>Colleen had to wait an extra hour for me to go through immigration and
customs in Seattle.  Once we hung out, though, it was like no time had
passed!</p>

there!  I didn&rsquo;t miss it did I??? ohhh gate change information and 75
minute delay..</p>

                        <p>Wandering a bit aimlessly, I discovered there&rsquo;s a lounge where certain
customers can chill and maybe get food and drinks..  I am apparently
not one of those customers, so I don&rsquo;t know!</p>

<p>Rejected, but not too dejected, I noticed an information booth so went
to talk to them.  I found out exactly what kind of customer is allowed
(over 50,000 miles), but she wasn&rsquo;t able to look up the mileage I have
since I am flying on a different airline.</p>

<p>Turned around and noticed a cool little exhibit type thing where we
can create wood block prints at no charge!  Wow!  Perfect gift for
Colleen, and with the perfect timing: I had just enough time to make
the print before boarding started on my flight!</p>
