                        <p class=date>1 April 1996 (no foolin!)</p>

<p>My two most recent skating adventures were this past Thursday and
Friday.  I've skated several times since I wrote Skating Adventure
Twelve, but I never typed them up.  So I'll pile several adventures
into one here.</p>

<p>Some weeks ago, we met at Fuzzies and decided somewhat arbitrarily
to skate to Transco Tower, which is probably about 10 miles from
Fuzzies.  Soon after we began our adventure, one of my skate wheels
died.  More specifically, the polyurethane ripped away from the
plastic hub.  I still had 7 wheels, so no problem.  However(!) by the
time we got to Transco Tower, and skated down its garage twice, I had
lost another wheel.  We skated a bit beyond the tower, and at our
furthest point from downtown, I was down to 5 wheels.  Yikes!  I lost
one more on the way back..  It sure seemed like a long skate ("please,
wheels, stay with me. please please") all the way back to Houston.  As
we were one (1) block away from Fuzzies, I was on 4 wheels, 2 on each
skate (we had to move them as they ripped off so that the missing
wheels were in the middle), and one of those began to rip off.  I won
the award of "Most Wheels Lost During One Night."</p>

<p>A different night, a group of us skated down the hill of "Coyote Park," 
so named for the bronze coyote statues around the water fountain/fall 
in the park.  Someone put a traffic cone on one of the coyotes as we
came in.   We skated fast down the hill, which is a fun challenge because
it is a sidewalk of miniature cobblestones, and they were a teeny bit 
wet.  That makes it *amazingly* easy to slide off, or otherwise lose
your footing and tumble (hopefully tumble on the grass).  I skated down
it again, faster than the first time.  I slid as I made the turn near the
bottom, but was able to control it and not wreck.  That was fun.   On the
way out of the park, someone put the traffic cone in the coyote's mouth,
making it look like a big megaphone.  That was funny.</p>

<p>For the past two or three Thursday nights, there has been a band playing
at Jones Plaza for "Party on the Plaza."  Lots of skaters and skate boarders
converge at the Plaza to talk and skate.  Some "grind" on the steps.
I saw Ed there this past Thursday.  He is arguably the absolute *best*
skater in Houston.  He and I wanted to do some fun skating, while the rest
of the group wanted to use up a $40 credit at a bar somewhere.  So Ed and
I skated around with Scott, who brought his frisbee.  We played frisbee
in a parking lot, making some pretty cool catches and throws (I could 
tell we were a bit out of practice) until Scott ripped his finger open
somehow.   We rested, and Scott left.  Ed and I went to UH Downtown
to skate the big hill there.</p>

<p>At the top of the hill I counted off 8 or 9 seconds and then we blazed down
to the bottom, where I easily passed a van that was waiting for the light.
Ed slowed down specifically and latched onto the van for a bit after it
got moving.  He threw himself forward as he and the van got near the next
intersection.  He just about flung himself into the path of a police car
as it crossed in front of us.  That would have been interesting.</p>

<p>We skated down 2 garages: First City and Luther's.  We almost got
kicked out of Luther's, so we went up the elevator an alternate
way..</p>

<p>We got to my car and hung out at Ed's for a while as he showed me
all his killer photos of him doing crazy awesome stuff on the half
pipes.  He convinced me (without much difficulty) to skate at the
skate park the next day.</p>
