                        <p class=date>21 May 1996</p>

<p>I have been skating lots and lots lately, and have written no stories
since they're all about the same.  Tonight, skating was different.</p>

<p>Today the Olympic Torch was paraded down Memorial Drive into downtown
Houston, and we skaters were invited to skate with the parade!!  I got to
Memorial Park area at 6:30pm, expecting a much smaller crowd than what I
found.  There were tons of people on foot, skates, bikes, cops on horses,
and lots of golf carts parade vehicles full of people.  Three hook-n-ladder
fire engines, 3 or 4 trucks and/or trailers with varied groups all in
costume.  Area Youth Choir, Texas Army, some cloggers, some African style
drummers, cheerleaders, something else, a few Art Cars, and 10 count-em
10 BMWs with various celebrities in them. (More on one of those in a sec)
</p>

<p>While the parade assembled, I skated up and down the row of vehicles, 
talking to various people from various places.  I talked to Leonard, who I 
knew as a cartoonist from UH, and who was now taking photos for the UH paper.  
I told the kids in the choir, "yes, I *promise* I actually shook hands 
with one of the Rockets."  (I don't know who, but he was tall.)  The cloggers
asked where I got my knee pads; they have a dance(?) move or something that
requires them to kneel hard on the floor.</p>

<p>Pretty quickly, it became 8pm, and time for the parade to roll.  We skaters
snuck our way right in front of the front BMW, which happened to be carrying
Kim Zmeskal, Gold(?) Medalist from the 1992 Olympics!  I was amazingly 
pleased with that.  I said HI to her a bit, that I'm a non practicing 
gymnast, and that I still have a photo of her from Time magazine in my
scrapbook.  (Oops.  I just checked, and apparently I was mistaken.)</p>

<p>For the first 15 or so minutes, I skated up and down the length of about
half of the parade, until I got griped at by a cop.  So, I went back up 
to where the skaters were and talked with Kim.  Turns out that she skates.
So I gave her our "Come Skate with US: Urban Skaters" card, and she said
she may join us. (no pun intended)  That will be totally cool if she does.</p>

<p>The parade went under a bridge that had cool sloping concrete, and only
a few people under it.  I skated up and down it about 4 times, pleased
that I never wiped out.</p>

<p>Near the end of the route, we skaters were not allowed to join the BMWs
to the backstage area of the final torch area thingamajig, so we skated
around to the front with the rest of the public, and they had singers and
speakers and the mayor said some stuff and then there were fireworks and
all that.  During that time, I met Sonja, who I realized, as soon as she
said her name, that I had met her over a year, maybe 2 years ago, skating.
Wow!  I told her that I remembered her as the first female skater I had
ever met who would jump ramps and do all the cool stuff that some of the
guys would do.  She replied, "that *was* a long time ago!"</p>

<p>After all the fireworks and such, Sonja and I skated over to Jones Plaza,
where it was SuperTejano night.  (I guess it would be pronounced Ho'nace
Plaza)  We sat and watched Ed and other skaters grind on the steps.  Ed was 
practicing a new soul stance(?) or something equally impressive.</p>

<p>Sonja and I cruised over to Texas Club parking garage, one of my favorites
in Houston.  I suggested that we not go to the top floor, so we could
avoid seeing the sign that says "NO SKATING."  About halfway down, Sonja
slipped and scraped her leg a bit. (yeah yeah that's why the sign is there.)
She sexistly said, "no sweat; I'll take it like a man."  We skated the rest
of the way down without incident.</p>

<p>Skated to Brewery Tap, where we got water and Sonja cleaned her abrasion.
Then we skated over to Fuzzy's where she was parked, and we talked a bit with
Oliver, foreign exchange student from Germany.  We taught him some Texan
slang like, "We're fixin' to skate and I recon y'all can join us ifyewanoo."
That was entertaining.</p>

<p>It became pretty late, so we went home.</p>
