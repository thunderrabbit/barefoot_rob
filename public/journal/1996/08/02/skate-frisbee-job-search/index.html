                        <p class=date>2 August 1996</p>

<p>Last night was my most recent Wild Skating Adventure.  I started at
Fuzzy's at about 9pm and skated down to Jones Plaza, where a Rod Stewart
impersonator was performing at Party on the Plaza.  For some reason,
there was not a very large crowd. ;)</p>

<p>I chatted with Joy and said HI to a couple of friends and tried to
find someone to play frisbee with me across the street at Jones Hall.
No one was interested, so I went to go play by myself, thank-you-very-much.
Turns out there was a security guard there, who was not allowed to
let anyone play in the area.  Doh!</p>

<p>So I talked with him a bit.  He's from Sudan and has a cool accent;
Sudan has about 200 languages spoken there but everyone speaks Arabic;
He's been in the US for a few months after being given political 
asylum in Egypt by the US.  He still wouldn't let me play frisbee.</p>

<p>So I went back to the Plaza and assured Joy that it didn't *matter* if
she had never played frisbee before; she could learn and be very
good at it.   We cruised over to a bank parking lot down the street
and played there.  She did quite well throwing for her first time.</p>

<p>As we played, a family walked by, including a 12-or-so year old girl.
I had just missed a catch and she smart alec-ly smiled, "it helps if
you catch it."</p>

<p>"Thank you so much," I replied.</p>

<p>After they walked by, she was still watching, so I threw it to her.
She yelled, "hey don't throw it to me *I* can't catch it!"  She missed,
but threw it back pretty well.</p>

<p>Skated back to the Plaza and hung out there a bit.  Some drunk guy
was telling me (I think) about how he was going to become a ninja and
one day everyone would want to be like him.  One day, he's going to
make a lot of money.  He didn't have a plan of action, though.</p>

<p>Joy and Linda and I skated toward La Carafe, where they planned to
get something to drink.  I got sidetracked at Market Square, where
some people were playing in the water sprinklers and shouted something
including the word "frisbee" so I threw it to them.</p>

<p>I was hot; the water was refreshing; I took my skates off and joined
them.</p>

<p>The grass felt super on my bare feet.  Freshly cut, it made a great
diversion from hot skates.  My clothes were entirely soaked after 
playing about 20 minutes.  Entirely refreshed and entirely wet,
I went inside to chat with Joy.  After about ten minutes of trying to
figure out how we can meet Ms/Mr "Right", I realized I was only wearing
one kneepad.  Doh!</p>

<p>I hoped not many people would be interested in a lonely kneepad
on the sidewalk.  When I went outside, I found a guy selling flowers and
watching for the owner of this mysterious kneepad.  He asked if I would
like to buy his whole bouquet of flowers for only four dollars.  I
truly did not have any money on me, but I was truly thankful for his
gaurdian services, so I went inside and snagged a dollar from Joy.
I bought 1 flower and talked with him for a while.</p>

<p>His name is David, and he's been homeless in Houston for about 6 months.
He had been laid off his welding job in Dallas, and came here for a
job that didn't work out.</p>

<p>While listening to his story, I could tell he took great pride in his
welding work, as well as pride in that he has not resorted to any illegal
activities to feed himself.  I also noted that he didn't necessarily
believe that anyone needed welding done.</p>

<p>I suggested simply that he talk to people, "say- who do you know that
works where people weld?"  Or maybe go to a truck stop and just start
talking to the truckers, who certainly come into vaguely close contact
with the welding profession.  (Certainly closer than I do, as a 
programmer.)</p>

<p>Joy came outside and I gave her the flower in exchange for her answer
to "who do you know that needs to hire a welder?"  Her dad works over
in the ship yards.  Certainly he would know someone.  She didn't have
his work number handy, but the point was made clear: he may find
work more easily if he poses that question to people.</p>

<p>David cruised over to Pete's Blues Burgers to see what he could buy
for a dollar and to see who knew of some welding jobs.  Joy and Linda
cruised home, and I cruised back over to Jones Plaza.</p>

<p>The younger crowd of aggressive skaters were there, grinding on the
steps, so I stopped to watch.  Randy saw my frisbee so I threw it to
him and we tossed it around a bit.  The drunk would-be-ninja guy
was there and he played pretty well for his condition.  Maybe he
will be a ninja.  I did a few cool catches, considering I had to
navigate the curb, parked cars, and a few moving vehicles on the
street.  At least *I* thought they were cool.</p>

<p>They weren't cool enough to keep me entertained for more than about
30 minutes, so I went home.</p>
