                        <p class=date>31 August 1996</p>

<p>This Labor Day weekend I am in Chicago visiting my friend Laura.
Yesterday I went skating.  She lives 1 block from Lake Shore Drive which curves
around her section of Lake Michigan.  I cruised over to the bike and skate
path they have along the beachfront.  It's mostly nice smooth asphalt, with a 
couple of steps down toward the shore, which is sand in some case, asphalt or 
concrete in others.</p>

<p>I sped along the path, navigating between walkers, joggers, skaters and bikers
as some bikers navigated past me.  If the path got too crowded, I would jump 
down the couple of steps to the much wider asphalt beach, and then back up to 
the sidewalk once I was past the crowds.</p>

<p>That was cool for a while, but I sought more adrenaline.</p>

<p>I used a pedestrian overpass to pass over Lake Shore Drive, and I ended
up in a park, from which I headed toward downtown.  I took care to note
which streets I was using, so I could find my way back.  I cruised the wrong
way down Dearbourne for a few blocks, looking for more traffic than it
provided. (I skate the "wrong way" so that I can see the oncoming traffic and 
take evasive action if necessary.  I don't like it when cars sneak up on me.)</p>

<p>I met Lynette who was skating in search of The Baby Gap.  I skated with 
her, asking where the coolest places to skate might be.  We ended up cruising 
down Michigan Avenue a couple of blocks.  ( I think it was Michigan Avenue - 
hey, it's a new city for me )  We parted ways, and I went down Grand Avenue 
(maybe) toward Navy Pier, where they have cool water fountains and a 200 foot
tall ferris wheel, a carousel, a big shopping mall and an IMAX movie thing.  
I skated around the big outdoor fountain, which had semi-predictable patterns 
of water squirting where kids kids and adults (not skaters who don't want to 
get their bearings wet) could play.</p>

<p>I skated up an 18 wheeler access ramp and back down.  It was only about 40 feet
tall so no big deal.</p>

<p>I skated back down to Michigan Avenue, so I could play in traffic.</p>

<p>I pushed my way between oncoming traffic and parked cars, sometimes onto the 
sidewalk weaving between people when the street got a bit crowded.  Sometimes 
turning hard when I missed a traffic light.  Every person for himself, 
compassionless, emotionless, honking, city traffic.  I love it.  
No one noticed a lone speeding skater, as long as he skated out of the way.</p>

<p>I found my way back to Lake Shore Drive, where I just rolled slowly watching
the people.  I saw a woman doing some cool "technical" footwork skating
backwards weaving her feet quickly between road reflectors spaced about
4 feet apart.  I was impressed with her ability.  Another woman sped past, 
manuevering through the crowds as I like to do.  So I took off after her.  
I figured she, if anyone, would know where to find the coolest places to skate.</p>

<p>I was tired, and she was probably in better shape than I, so I had to really 
work to keep up.  The lake front path magically converted into mid city 
sidewalk, as it angled down toward a busy city street.  "Cool"  I thought, as 
she aggressively cut through the bikes and people at the intersection.  I 
double checked her check for traffic and we both flashed across the street 
and onto the next curb.</p>

<p>Muscling up a hill, through much less pedestrian traffic,  I skated up beside 
her.  "You are the most aggressive skater I've seen all day."  She didn't 
comment, but answered by taking a sharp turn in front of me and away down a 
different path.    I took that as a hint to buzz off.</p>

<p>On the way back, I attacked the interesting intersection with similar vigor,
cutting around the back of a bicycle crossing my path, and converting much 
kinetic energy into heat and ruts in the grass as I made it off the street 
and stopped without crashing through several people and a dog.</p>

<p>I wound my way much more slowly after that, not to be more careful, but I was 
just dog tired.  I made it back and went skating again the next day.</p>
