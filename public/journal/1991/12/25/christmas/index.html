<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)</p>

<p><p>The zoo was cool.  We went to every exhibit, except that I noticed
we did not see girraffes.  The reptiles were cool.  This will all be
written haphazardly, since I want to write about what just happened.
At the zoo, we saw a huge ass <em>green moray</em>.  It was in a tank
with a nurse shark and a lemon shark.  We saw some huge ass snakes,
too.  We saw the gorilla do this (on his back the entire time): Long
slow lazy scratches on his belly, scratching toward his crotch,
flipped his back legs up by his ears, long slow scratches from chest
to crotch.</p>

<p><p>We saw lions doing weird stuff.  (I think one was in heat and the
others were trying to hump her) But one of the lion&rsquo;s tail was being
chewed on by the 3 lions including herself.</p>

<p><p>At Emerson, I met Amy &amp; Janna, daughters of Jan, minister of
Emerson.  They were pretty.  After the thing, me, Cheri, &amp; Ma stopped
by Transco falls and the City Hall Christmas lights.  I took Cheri
home and then came home to Tomball.</p>

<p><p>Just now, Fred said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see who can eat the most sweet tarts.&rdquo;
I said, &ldquo;Crud. I had wanted to save some for tomorrow..&rdquo; We each
crammed 27 Sweet Tarts into our mouths.  Try it.  We could not chew.
We started to laugh - cracking up laughing. Dying laughing.  We had to
go outside so as to not cough them up on the carpet.  I started to
choke and spat them into my hand.  Fred couldn&rsquo;t chews them and
drooled them off the porch into the grass.  He said, &ldquo;Oh Well.&rdquo;  I
started cracking up more and spat them back into my hand and then
threw them as far as possible.  HA HA HA.  We were dying laughing.
Tears &amp; the whole works.  It must have been a location joke, though,
since you&rsquo;re not laughing.</p>
