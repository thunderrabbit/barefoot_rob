                        <p>##02:18 Tuesday 19 July 2005</p>

<p>We 16 GET Teachers (GET stands for Global English/Espanol Training) all teach two classes a day on 35 days of the voyage.  During our free time we have the option of being quite busy with lectures and myriad activities on the ship.  (( One of the biggest &ldquo;problems&rdquo; on the ship is deciding what to do next!  Every room usually teems with activity. ))  Somewhere during all that (usually at night when we&rsquo;ve got several hours before classes) we plan lessons, with each teacher designing his or her own curriculum to fit the students and hopefully coordinate with the ports we&rsquo;re visiting, etc.  One basic philosophy allows the students to immediately use the English they&rsquo;re learning.</p>

<p>GET Teachers and CCs (Communication Coordinators (translators)) room together, separated by gender, with usually 3 or 4 people per room.  We&rsquo;re on the 3rd floor of the ship, the lowest level for passengers, with only crew below us.</p>

<p>Right next to my room is a Water Tight Door.  Every night it closes around 11pm and opens around 6am.   Its loud clanging rumble no longer wakes me, but simply gives me a general gauge of how much longer I can sleep.  I have a plan to stick a piece of cardboard in as it shuts to see what happens, but so far this plan hasn&rsquo;t been executed.</p>

<p>Very close to my room are stairs (and elevator) which connect all the floors, and in about 10 seconds I can leave my room and arrive on the 4th floor in the dining room called Topaz Dining.  This dining room usually serves buffet style meals in the morning and set meals for lunch and dinner.  During the set meals, we must arrive within a 20 minute &ldquo;seating window&rdquo; to make things simpler for the cooks and wait staff who really work hard to provide excellent customer service.  All the waitstaff can speak English and Japanese (at least the niceties) and their own languages.  I have learned Good Morning and Thank You in Bulgarian, Thank You in Chinese and Filipino (though I already knew the Chinese version), and I try to use the correct words depending on who is serving our table.</p>

<p>On the 5th floor is GET Street, the name of the hallway which contains 10 classrooms where we teach our lessons.  Basically there are 30 English classes a day, with each teacher teaching 2 classes.  (Adriana teaches Spanish.)  I am in GET Room 9 from 8am to 9:25am and then GET Room 4 from 9:30am to 10:55am.  A computer in each room (new for this voyage!) allows us to use multimedia during our lessons: powerpoint, music, movies, etc.  I also use it to take notes and define vocabulary words for the students and give them a printout after the classes.  The rest of 5th floor is filled with passenger rooms.  And the infirmary.</p>

<p>In addition to many rooms, on the sixth floor (but on the other end of the ship) is the GET Office where, last cruise, all the lesson planning was done.  I can&rsquo;t really imagine what it must have been like for 15 teachers all vying for time on two old PCs with a single printer and cranky copy machine.   This voyage seems to be like a transition, as some things are still done in the GET Office, but most things are being done down on GET Street.  Also on the 6th floor is Reception, next to which we usually dis/embark the ship.  Reception is staffed 24 hours and basically works like a hotel reception desk.</p>

<p>On the 7th floor most of the daily Peace Boat activity takes place.  Broadway is a large meeting room that spans the back of the ship.  Lectures happen there during the day and performances at night.  A theater is next up from Broadway where they play ping pong during the day and various movies at night.  I haven&rsquo;t played ping pong nor watched any movies there.  After that are some storage rooms and then Peace Center, which seems to be staffed 24 hours, by diligent workers who produce the daily schedule in Japanese and English and the daily paper with ship news.</p>

<p>The schedule is a monstrosity in itself, with nearly every minute of every room filled.  The schedule is quite dynamic; people come up with new activities they want to do and vie for time in various rooms.  The English schedule is usually quite entertaining with misspellings and funny translations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s 1970!&rdquo;  or &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s 21 years old!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s learning Korean drum!&rdquo;  or &ldquo;Sawing Circle&rdquo; or &ldquo;Bleak Dancing&rdquo;  &ldquo;Frag Semaphore&rdquo;  (the last two being R-L mixups) &ldquo;Scream out the name of the person you love&rdquo;</p>

<p>Next on the ship is the Free Space, next to Hemingway Bar (a piano bar).  Then there is Winjammer Lounge (variously spelled with or without a D) which is nearly as wide as the ship save for a hallway on each side.  A small gameroom and meeting room are past Windjammer, and then several nice passenger rooms.</p>

<p>The 8th floor is outside: basically the deck around the perimeter of the ship, and sports deck (above Winjammer, which sometimes gives stomp-enhanced lectures) and then a small room called T-Club next to the small weight gym), then the front deck (where we are not allowed to jump because passengers may be sleeping below).  The back of the ship on 8th floor is an always-buffet dining area called Yacht Club during the day and a Japanese style bar at night.</p>

<p>The 9th deck is near the center of the ship.  It&rsquo;s called the pool deck because &hellip;&hellip; there are two pools and a jacuzzi available when we&rsquo;re in the middle of the ocean.  The water is pulled straight up from the ocean, so it&rsquo;s the same temperature as what the fish are experiencing.</p>

<p>Next to the pool deck is Sunshine Bar, an outdoor bar by the pool.  This bar is not as popular as the others, but people often spend a little quiet time there.</p>
