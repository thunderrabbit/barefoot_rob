<p>Hello family and friends&hellip;</p>

<p>I am sorry it has been awhile since I sent an e-mail.  I have been able to
get a few pieces published and have been focusing on writing for those.
I have thought about sending them out to this list but I fear they would
be repetitive.  There is so little information out there that each piece I
write has a lot of the same background information.  One piece can be
found on Common Dreams at
<a href="https://www.commondreams.org/views06/0910-23.htm">https://www.commondreams.org/views06/0910-23.htm</a></p>

<p>This weekend has been full of independence day celebrations here in
Mexico.  The Governor of Oaxaca usually does the &ldquo;grito&rdquo; or cry of
independence on the 15th in the main square.  Since the governor has been
banished from the state, APPO organized the celebration and an indigenous
man did the cry.  This had to be a first.  Governor Ulises had planned to
do it from another town in Oaxaca but the popular struggle was not going
allow that and in the end he didn&rsquo;t show his face.  Odd similarity to the
national situation where President Fox, too, was unable to give the
&ldquo;grito&rdquo; in the Mexico City main square because of Obrador and his
supporters so he had to do it in another town.</p>

<p>Below is the latest article I have written, the background info is
repetitive for you all but there is some up to date info and some broader
analysis.  Keep in mind this will be published in slingshot, an anarchist
newspaper, so this one is not written for a mainstream audience.</p>

<p>I do fear the movement may be facing some more repression soon so please
pass this info on to folks who might be interested, we have a lot of power
to stop such repression from the states if people are aware&hellip;</p>

<p>Graffiti calling for the ousting of the Governor of the state covers
almost every blank wall in the historic district of Oaxaca City.  The
Zócalo, or main square, and the 50 blocks that surround it have become the
home of the statewide teachers strike since the end of May.  The
encampment is surrounded by makeshift blockades of metal sheeting and
barbed wire, large pieces of concrete and in some cases reclaimed
government cars and buses keeping traffic of these streets.   Multicolored
tarps cover blankets and cardboard used at night to sleep on by the
thousands involved in the struggle, community kitchens gather donations
and prepare large pots of beans and rice, a clinic is set up by supportive
workers in the medical field to serve those who have left their villages
and homes and are living in the encampments.  Many teachers embroider,
read the latest movement communiqué, and gather in circles holding
meetings.  Banners from unions and municipalities from all over the state
supporting this popular struggle hang between trees and light posts.
Stencils depicting Mexico’s revolutionary heroes, calling for the people
to rise up and demanding the release of political prisoners are
everywhere.  This encampment in the main square marks where the movement
began last May, but it has since expanded and encampments can now be found
throughout the city.  They now surround all government buildings in the
city and protect the four radio stations and their transmitters that have
been taken over and are currently held by the movement.  These four
channels air march and meeting announcements, discussions, alerts and
calls for backup at the scenes of government repression of the movement.
This is just within Oaxaca City.  At least 200 villages in the state have
joined in and reclaiming their town halls.</p>

<p><strong>How the Movement Began</strong>
Seventy percent of the 3.5 million people who live in the state of Oaxaca
are indigenous.  Over half live in abject poverty, 35 percent do not have
piped water in their homes.  The Mexican constitution demands that all
children have the same access to education.  And yet today in Oaxaca the
average person spends only 5.6 years in school, two years less than the
national average. The conditions in the rural schools are extremely poor,
with a lack of basic infrastructure. Children often come to school hungry,
barefoot and are without desks, books and pencils.  For the past 26 years
Section 22 of the National Union of Education Workers has held an annual
statewide strike.  Some of the demands this year included raises, basic
supplies and breakfast for the students.  Each year the teachers camp out
in the main square of Oaxaca city until an adequate compromise is reached.
This year things played out a little different.  At 4:30 am on June 14th
while teachers and their families were sleeping, 3000 police raided the
encampment, a helicopter fired teargas from the sky, cops beat people,
burnt their belongings leaving over 100 people injured.  The teachers
resisted with sticks and rocks, reclaiming the square later the same day.
And they have remained ever since.</p>

<p><strong>Construction of the Popular Assembly</strong>
Immediately after the government repression a mega march was held where
400,000 people came to show support for the teachers. A new entity was
formed of the 350 organizations that mobilized alongside the teacher
strike called the Popular Assembly of the People of Oaxaca (APPO).
Through hours of meetings this organization has come to represent not just
the voice of the striking teachers but also the voice of all those in the
state who face oppression and injustice.  According to Florentino, a
member of the press committee, “APPO does not set out to impose any
decisions, what we set out to do is to integrate all the people so that
together we can organize and govern the state.” Without leaders and using
collective decision making, APPO advances daily with announcements of new
actions and strategies. The indigenous people of the region have a long
history with this type of organizational structure; many municipalities
are still run by the general assemblies under the traditional native
customs of usos y costumbres.  These assemblies are not affiliated with
political parties and select the municipal presidents who then lead by
following, accountable to those who selected them.</p>

<p>On August 16th and 17th APPO held a forum entitled “Building Democracy and
Governability in Oaxaca,”  with sessions covering the design of a new
state constitution, creating democracy from below, movement inclusion and
respect for diversity.  Since the formation of APPO, a clear consensus
decision was made to change the primary demand from those of the teachers’
to the resignation of the Governor of Oaxaca, Ulises Ruiz Ortiz.  Not only
because of his responsibility in the violent repression of their
democratic teachers&rsquo; strike but because he was brought to power through
fraud, and since the beginning of his term he has favored corporate
interests and undermined social organizations.</p>

<p><strong>Corrupt Governments and their Development Plans</strong>
Corrupt exploitive governments are nothing new to Oaxaca or to Mexico.  In
fact the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), made up of the
conservative right, light skinned, wealthy class, has held the position of
governor of Oaxaca for the past 80 years and all of Mexico for over 70
years, previous to the current President Vicente Fox’s rule.  There were
hopes for Fox to step out of the traditional exploitive role but his
party, the National Action Party (PAN), has carried on the PRI legacy of
neoliberal expansion, corruption and repression of social organizations.</p>

<p>With help from the leaders of the Central American countries, Fox
initiated Plan Puebla Panama, PPP, a neoliberal development mega project,
praised by the United States.  This project, claiming one of its main
goals is to improve the conditions for the people of the region, in
actuality is stealing land from indigenous people for infrastructure
projects to move resources more quickly into the hands of multinational
corporations and commodifying their culture for the tourist industry.  One
of the projects with huge implications for Oaxaca is the creation of a
super highway at Mexico’s skinniest point, the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, in
order to move resources more readily across the land from the Atlantic to
the Pacific.  This transportation corridor will be surrounded with
sweatshops, maquiladoras, free of labor and environmental laws.  “For all
of these objectives, the government of Oaxaca is key to the realization of
the project,” explained Florentino.</p>

<p>Ulises Ruiz Ortiz is a carbon copy of the most corrupt PRI leadership
which exploits and represses the majority indigenous population to serve
the interests of foreign corporations and maintain nationwide PRI control,
a perfect match to prepare the region for the implementation of the PPP.
Unable to be elected democratically, Ulises was forced to steal his
position through vote buying, ballot box tampering and computer fraud.  On
December 1st 2004, his first day as Governor, 40 armed men including PRI
municipal leaders with police support occupied the Noticias, a major
newspaper for the region which covered illegitimacy of the election.  The
newspaper has been operating out of a different location ever since.  In
the 21 months that Governor Ulises Ruiz Ortiz has been in power 37 people
have been killed for political reasons.  With this record his response to
the democratic teachers strike on June 14th comes as no surprise.</p>

<p><strong>Government Repression Continues</strong>
The repressive tactics against the movement have continued since June
14th.  Arrest warrants have been issued for at least 80 movement “leaders”
including members of the teachers union.  Four have been abducted from the
street by unmarked vans, photos of one, a biologist, severely beaten were
seen in the local news.  The faces of the four political prisoners and a
strong call for their freedom can be seen wheat pasted throughout
downtown.  In response to that repression a march was held on August 10th,
20,000 attended with one days notice.  Half way through the march
government goons shot into the crowd killing José Jimenez Colmenares, a
mechanic and the husband of a teacher. Yet the movement remains dedicated
to not taking up arms.  Instead APPO has used the main strategy of
creating a situation of ungovernability in Oaxaca preventing the state
government from meeting, orchestrating state wide strikes, blockading bank
and wealthy business, and controlling transportation through highway
stoppages.</p>

<p>In late August the federal government finally agreed to negotiations with
APPO and 28 representatives, half teachers, went to Mexico City.  These
negotiations are not likely to go anywhere because the federal government
refuses to back down and the movement is unwilling to compromise on the
resignation of Ulises Ruiz Ortiz. A teacher living in an encampment
outside one of the radio stations explained “Some compañeros want to
accept the crumbs that the federal government is offering us and say that
maybe we better return to class so that this can end peacefully, as if
nothing has happened, but there are a lot of us that say no, because this
would imply forgetting the reality that we have been living until now.  I
insist this type of repression before has not been seen in Oaxaca and if
we allow it, believe me when I say, that we would condemn the state of
Oaxaca to live like this.  Something that would not only affect the
teachers but every social group that would want to rise up in the
future.”</p>

<p><strong>Power of Community Radio</strong>
Radio has played a very significant role in this movement, giving new
voice to the voiceless.  A radio station, created by the striking teachers
with community support was destroyed by the police during the June 14th
repression.  In response, students from the Autonomous University of
Benito Juarez reclaimed their radio station, Radio Universidad, and it
became the means of communication for the movement.  It too was shot into
by government goons and acid was poured on the transmitter, destroying the
station.  On August 1st a 3000 strong women’s march moved through downtown
clanging pots and pans, in the spirit of the march of “cacerolas” in
Chile, and calling for the resignation of the state governor of Oaxaca,
Ulises Ruiz Ortiz.  Leila, a member of the women’s coordination committee
of APPO explained, “The pots and pans reflect that in Oaxacan homes, there
is no food.  In a country where there is no justice, no equality, where
there is no respect for human rights, these pans are not only empty of
food but also of these basic principles.”</p>

<p>After the march ended in the main square, a contingent of 500 women
decided to take over Channel 9 CORTV, a state wide television station and
its two affiliated radio stations.  After a few hours the women got the
channel back on the air.  They began to express many reasons for the
takeover, to continue the pressure for the governor’s resignation, to
reclaim the space for the community, to air the news that is not getting
covered and to use the mode of communication for organizing and spreading
word of the needs of the movement.   On August 21st police and government
goons attacked the transmitter control room for Channel 9 taking it and
two affiliated radio stations off the air.  A contingency plan had been
created and within hours 11 radio stations were under the control of
movement members, many of them women from Channel 9.</p>

<p>Encampments and street blockades were set up protect the new stations from
plain clothed cops and paramilitaries who appear at night and fire into
the encampments.  One movement member guarding radio station was killed
bringing the total deaths to eight.  This repression has had the opposite
effects of its apparent goals to disable the movement with fear, instead,
more and more people can be found sleeping in the encampments outside the
radio stations and the determination of the people seems stronger and
stronger. On September 3rd APPO declared the Governor banned from the
state and have essentially taken over control of the state.  Florentino
explained, “For us the process of destruction of the government and the
resignation of Ulises has already ended so that a phase of construction
can begin, of creating governability, of showing that we are capable of
governing ourselves.”</p>

<p>In this National Climate the Winds of Oaxaca Reach Far and Wide
While the people have managed, at least for the time being to reclaim
Oaxaca from the hands of the corrupt and repressive leadership, on the
national level Felipe Calderon, with the help of the conservative Federal
Election Commission (TRIFE), has managed to fraudulently steal the
national presidency.  On September 6th TRIFE unanimously handed the
presidency of Mexico to Calderon even though he had only half a percent
lead out of 41.6 million votes over the left PRD candidate Manuel Lopez
Obrador amidst an immense amount of evidence pointing to fraud.  Obrador,
who some on the left have criticized as a moderate, has campaigned on
helping the poor and is refusing to back down, mobilizing millions against
the fraud in Mexico City.</p>

<p>In preparation for the his final State of the Union address on September
1st, President Fox planned to keep the Obrador supporters at bay with 10
foot tall metal barricades, thousands of armed federal police, water
cannons and military snipers stationed on rooftops of surrounding
buildings.  He did not foresee the 155 senators and congress members who
felt the election was fraudulent and who prevented the speech from the
inside by taking over the podium.  Fox ended up giving a televised
address.  On September 16th at a National Democratic Convention for the
people voted Obrador as President of a “parallel government” with plans to
prevent Calderon from taking office on December 1st.  Those in power
continue to try and carry on with business as usual.  According to a White
House spokesperson, two days after Calderon was handed the presidency,
George Bush expressed the desire to “meet at the earliest mutually
convenient opportunity” especially to move forward on Plan Puebla to
Panama.  Try as they might, they can not continue to ignore what is being
created in the poor and indigenous communities in Oaxaca and throughout
Mexico.</p>

<p>“The worry that is maybe the biggest of all is the fear of being
repressed, the fear of being incarcerated, the fear of being harshly
beaten, and of course, the fear of dying because that is what we are
exposed to,” states a teacher afraid to share his name.  Yet the dignity
and courage in his eyes and in the eyes of so many suggests to me that
perhaps the strength of this mass mobilization of people with justice in
their hearts and a clear understanding of the roots of their exploitation
in their minds can withstand this brutal repression.  The largest defense
against this repression is international solidarity as we have seen
throughout the Zapatista uprisings in Chiapas.  APPO has recently called
for international solidarity, for actions at Mexican consulates throughout
the world.  This struggle for human rights and self determination is not
new and what they are resisting is clearly not confined to Oaxaca.  In
fact Oaxaca is simply another front in this global struggle for social
justice.  And we, in the belly of the beast, where it is the easiest to
carry on and maintain the status quo, we must stand tall and not let a
single casualty in this struggle go unnoticed.  We gain strength with each
exploitive act and development plan that increases the distance between
the very rich and the growing poor.  Throughout the Americas things are
changing.  In South America the grass roots movements are expanding,
electing left leadership.  And in the states the immigrant rights
movements are on the move.  The potential for solidarity is endless.  The
Former Chiapas Bishop Samuel Ruíz García, a long time advocate for the
poor and indigenous communities, attended an APPO forum. In the closing
ceremonies he stated, “…it might be that we are standing in two time
dimensions, the past and the future. In these days we are living something
that we are leaving, and cement is being placed beneath something that
doesn’t come automatically but is the result of working together, of our
construction.”</p>
