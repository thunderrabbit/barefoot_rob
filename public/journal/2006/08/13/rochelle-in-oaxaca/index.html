                        <p>##21:43 Sunday 13 August 2006</p>

<p>Hello all…</p>

<p>So things in Oaxaca are intensifying and fast.</p>

<p>Last week there was a 2000+ womens&rsquo; march of the Popular Assembly of the</p>

<p>State of Oaxaca (APPO).  A quick recap, this is the organization that</p>

<p>formed after the June 14th police repression of the striking teachers</p>

<p>union SNTE Section 22.  APPO is made up of the teachers as well as a huge</p>

<p>variety of social organizations who support the teachers.  Since APPO&rsquo;s</p>

<p>formation the main goal has been to force the resignation of the</p>

<p>right-wing corrupt governor of Oaxaca State, Ulises Ruiz Ortiz.  The main</p>

<p>method being used to acheive this is to use nonviolent tactics to stop the</p>

<p>state government from functioning.  The state Government House, the State</p>

<p>Congress and the Oaxaca Superior Tribunal of Justice, the Department of</p>

<p>Finances, the General Attorney’s office, the penal tribunals, and other</p>

<p>facilities have all been blockaded.</p>

<p>So back to the women, after marching for five miles they nonviolently took</p>

<p>over the state tv station and have controlled it ever since.  It took them</p>

<p>a few hours to get it up and running but since then they have been playing</p>

<p>the footage of the June 14th repression, the march of 400,000 teachers and</p>

<p>growing number of supporters 2 weeks later, and other indymedia style</p>

<p>documentaries of class struggles going on throughout Mexico.  They even</p>

<p>played a documentay on the oppression faced by the Palestinians.  The</p>

<p>media here is controlled by the wealthy and those in power, like in the</p>

<p>states, so these things had never made it on to television.  The televison</p>

<p>station also has two affilited radio stations which the women now control</p>

<p>as well.</p>

<p>The movement has truly been growing, the largest mass movement I have ever</p>

<p>witnessed.  It is spreading throughout the whole state of Oaxaca. 40</p>

<p>municipalities and towns around the state have made changes to those in</p>

<p>power, 20 municipal town halls are currently occupied. Nineteen</p>

<p>municipalities have joined APPO and have sent people here to Oaxaca city</p>

<p>to further the struggle.  APPO has set up road blockades through out the</p>

<p>state and have taken over 6o public buses and 18 government cars.</p>

<p>Last week it was clear that APPO was acheiving its goals.  The movement</p>

<p>was growing and its voice was loud and clear through the women on the</p>

<p>television and radio stations and the university radio station.  Then on</p>

<p>the night of  August 6th, although denied by President Vicente Fox, 300</p>

<p>officers of the Federal Preventive Police arrived in the city.  On the</p>

<p>8th, 30 police men dressed in civilian clothing tried to disperse one of</p>

<p>the blockades in front of an occupied public building with tear gas and</p>

<p>gunfire.  One woman was shot in the leg.  Then the repression began to</p>

<p>show up all over the city in a series of events which I will list below to</p>

<p>keep it short&hellip;</p>

<p>August 7th</p>

<p>Two men start a bus on fire outside the university radio station as a</p>

<p>distraction, they then proceed to throw acid on the transmitter.  Radio</p>

<p>Universidad is shutdown.</p>

<p>A NGO leader is disappeared.</p>

<p>A university professor is shot dead in his car.</p>

<p>August 8th</p>

<p>A leading indigenous rights advocate and active in APPO, who is wheelchair</p>

<p>bound from past police torture, is picked up by masked men in an unmarked</p>

<p>car and disappeared with two men who were with him.</p>

<p>Two men enter the state newspaper, Noticias, which has been sympathetic to</p>

<p>the struggle and shoot into the air.</p>

<p>August 10th</p>

<p>The government of Oaxaca announced arrest warrants for 50 leaders of APPO,</p>

<p>including many NGO leaders and leaders within the teachers union Section</p>

<ol>
<li>According to the Secretary of Public Security, this is to “guarantee<br /></li>
</ol>

<p>the safety” of the state.</p>

<p>Also yesterday, a march was called by APPO against this repression and for</p>

<p>the release of those who have been disappeared.  At least 20,000 people</p>

<p>marched through the streets.  From the sidelines of the march shots were</p>

<p>fired killing one man, the husband of a teacher. The house that the shots</p>

<p>came from was rented by the police and a federal police badge was found</p>

<p>inside. Today APPO held a huge procession for the man who was killed</p>

<p>during the march into the center square, thousands attended the funeral</p>

<p>and chants that the struggle will continue were repeated for hours.</p>

<p>I believe the movement in Oaxaca has become a strong and diverse class</p>

<p>struggle against the corrupted officials and business-people who have been</p>

<p>in power in Oaxaca for decades. The state of Oaxaca is 70 percent</p>

<p>indigenous and has a long history of resistance and struggle.  Those in</p>

<p>power have begun a dirty war against the movement and I fear for these</p>

<p>brave people who continue to take a strong stand against extreme injustice</p>

<p>and corruption even as they see their fellow compañer@s fall.</p>

<p>And I encourage any of you that are able to make a call or write to</p>

<p>Vicente Fox and others to demand an end to this repression and respect for</p>

<p>human rights in the state of Oaxaca.  Contact info to follow&hellip;</p>

<p>with love,</p>
