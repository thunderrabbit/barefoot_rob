<p>That is from a thread between me, Dude and my brother after the announcement that we can&rsquo;t bring drinks onto planes anymore:</p>

<p>From: American Embassy Tokyo
Date: Aug 11, 2006 10:57 AM
Subject: Public Announcement</p>

<p><snip></p>

<p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is implementing a series of security measures, some visible and some not visible, to ensure the security of the traveling public and the nation&rsquo;s transportation system.</p>

<p>NO LIQUIDS OR GELS OF ANY KIND WILL BE PERMITTED IN CARRY-ON BAGGAGE. SUCH ITEMS MUST BE IN CHECKED BAGGAGE.</p>

<p>This includes all beverages, shampoo, suntan lotion, creams, tooth paste, hair gel, and other items of similar consistency</p>

<p>Exceptions: Baby formula and breast milk if a baby or small child is traveling and medicines, which must be presented for inspection at the checkpoint.</p>

<p><snip></p>

<p>From: Dude</p>

<p>what&rsquo;s crazy is that they are still allowing each person to carry two books of matches!!!  I really do not get this.  You cannot smoke on planes and in most airports.  Smoking is not vital to national security, and its a horrible public health problem.  oh yeah&hellip;.  the tobacco lobby gives alot of money to politicians.  Now I get it.</p>

<hr />

<p>From: Rob</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s infuriating!   _(ed. note: I am a genius!)</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">_</h2>

<p>From: Fred</p>

<p>the whole thing is a pile of shit.  chertoff is a complete idiot.  he is fourth on my list of people to hate after karl rove, dick cheney, and donald rumsfeld.  oh, and speaking of karl rove, i want to kick robert novak in the nuts for protecting him, and then patrick fitzgerald for giving rove immunity.  whatever company novak works for, i am never giving them money ever.</p>

<p>but back to air travel.  i mean, the system <em>worked</em>!  the bad guys got caught!  the us/uk cops could have intervened weeks ago, but they decided to wait until the shit was going down before arresting anybody, and now look at what&rsquo;s happened: water is the new terrorist threat.</p>

<p>recall that idiot who tried to light his shoes on fire.  everyone now knows the score: the civilized hijackings of the seventies are over. if guy says he has a bomb, you&rsquo;re all going to die anyway&ndash;bum rush him.  problem solved, just like on united 93.  no need for extra security, we can take care of things ourselves.  but what&rsquo;s happened? we still have to take off our shoes or get the wand, even years later! it&rsquo;s completely stupid, and it&rsquo;s a health risk.</p>

<p>people, people.  it&rsquo;s a fucking <em>bus</em>.  get on, sit down, and shut up.
there is no magic any more.  it is not a luxury cruise.  you cannot be &ldquo;secure.&rdquo;  you fly a plane cause it&rsquo;s <em>faster</em>, not because it&rsquo;s cheaper or safer.</p>

<p>i am writing a letter to my congressman telling him that he&rsquo;d better get it in gear or i&rsquo;m not voting for him.  no incumbents.  fuck you guys.</p>

<hr />

<p>From: Dude</p>

<p>amen!!!  I totally agree that any MF who tried anything on a plane would get bum-rushed and killed by passengers.  I know I&rsquo;d be one of the people kicking the guy&rsquo;s ass.  I&rsquo;d let out all of the anger I have at the bush administration on that dude.  he&rsquo;d be toast.  hahaha.</p>
