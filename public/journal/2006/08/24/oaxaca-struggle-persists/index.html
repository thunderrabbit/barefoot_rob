<p>from Rochelle:</p>

<p>hello all!
The teachers and their supporters continue to remain strong in the face of
nightly acts of repression.  The police and government goons shot up the
transmitter for channel 9, shutting down the state tv that the the women
from the movement had controlled since the 1st of August.  Immediately
stations all over the city were taken over.  In the last two nights two
teachers have been killed by government forces while protecting those
stations.  We have continued to post photos at&hellip;

<p>Below please find words from two of the teachers here&hellip;
hope everyone is well&hellip;
rochelle</p>

<p>&ldquo;I received your message and wanted to write that the situation within the
teacher&rsquo;s union is really difficult. We are living a terrible repression
under Ulises Ruiz Ortiz&rsquo;s government. Today at 12:30 a.m. a concerted
attack was launched against the teachers who were guarding the radio
stations. 40 pickups full of police leveled their guns at our companions
and fired without regard for who might be wounded or killed. During the
attack one teacher (male) was killed and another (woman) wounded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are placing guards at each of our camps and in reality we are armed
only with our conscience, reason and right. We ask anyone who can help
us to please let others know about the situation we are living by any
means at their disposal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The daily reality that we live through in Oaxaca should be told,
despite the media curtain that makes it difficult for even other
Oaxacans to know the truth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would like it if [the university where I study] would raise its voice
and let the world know about the situation, I would hope that their
understanding of social problems would press them to help us, but it
seems that the one-time leaders of social struggle have lost their
voice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>“In truth after last night we are afraid even though we don&rsquo;t say so. No
one wants to be exposed but we are aware that we have to go forward until
this is finished. The consensus without a doubt was that we go together
to the end. We are all saddened by the attitude of Governor Ulises Ruiz
Ortiz. Our leaders wanted us to participate in the strike in a limited,
representative fashion in order to keep us safe, but we voted to strike
as a group, to keep together. At this time there are very few around us
who remain quiet and indifferent and we are aware of this. I can assure
you that most have consciousness and awareness of what is happening. With
respect to our personal security no-one, absolutely no-one is safe in the
camps, but after our consensus decision I can assure you that we will
continue to the end.&rdquo;</p>
