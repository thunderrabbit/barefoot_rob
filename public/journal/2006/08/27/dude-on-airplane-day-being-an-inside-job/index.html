                        <p>##13:45 Sunday 27 August 2006</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2006/EDUCATION/08/06/sept11.theories.ap/index.html">https://www.cnn.com/2006/EDUCATION/08/06/sept11.theories.ap/index.html</a></p>

<p>I do not buy that 911 was an inside job by the government.  I can buy that the Neocons in the Bush admin potentially knew something was up and did nothing in order to create public sentiment that would rally behind the flag and agree to their extreme foriegn policy agenda, but that&rsquo;s a far cry from orchestrating the event and attacking your own nation with missiles, etc.  I don&rsquo;t believe that this happened, but I see the motivation that they may have had.</p>

<p>I heard James Fetzer, the co-founder of the Scholars for <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> Truth on a radio interview.  The guy claimed that some of the hijackers are still alive and living in Europe.  He claimed that the BBc had interviewed them on TV.  The radio host (of a liberal talk show) felt obligate dto follow-up on that point and googled for signs of this and could not find one orginal article on the BBC website.  So then he wanted to make sure that he tried hard enough to research the claim, and he called the BBC and tried to find a producer over there that knew anything about this.  The BBC producers laughed at him and hung up on him.</p>

<p>Furthermore, from listening to this guy, I truly believe that these people are just letting their emotion get the best of them.  This Fetzer guy claimed that he has experts that say that as few as 10 trips to the WTC could hav ebeen made prior to 911 to strategically place explosives, and because its such a small number of trips, that we should believe that no one saw anyone preparing the building for demolition.  I heard this and thought it was outrageous on its face.  If yo&rsquo;ve ever watched a documentary on demolitions of this type, they have to drill into the structural supports of the building with giant hammer-drills that pound away at the concrete like a jack-hammer while they are drilling.  On top of that, even if they only made 10 trips, as he says, they&rsquo;d have to carry at least a couple huge packages of explosives into the building.  So my question is &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t think that *<strong>anyone</strong> who worked in the WTC would have seen a guy walking around with a dufflebag full of explosives and a giant hammer-drill?  &hellip;and these guys would not have been simply walking down the stairwells.  from what i understand about these buildings, the main structural supports were (1) the center shaft of the building that housed the elevators/electrical/plumbing, and (2) the outter skin of the building.  How could someone access these parts of the building, drill into cement with a hammer-drill, place a whole bunch of explosives at key points, and still not have anyone notice???!!!???  Its simple common sense to me.  It just could not have happened.</p>

<p>Secondly, and much more damming to their assertion, is the fact that no one from within the conspiracy has come forward.  Something like a dozen people have left the Bush administration on bad terms and many have written tell-all books that the administration has been furious about.  The list is long and distinguished:  Colin Powell, Christie Whitman, Richard Clarke, Paul O&rsquo;Neil, Thomas White, Eric Shenseki, Lawrence Wilkerson.  &hellip;and all these people were let go for telling the truth.   &hellip;and many of them have said on the record that the Bush administration wante dto go to war with Iraq from day one.  If 911 was an inside job, why wouldn&rsquo;t any of these people, who already have been fire for telling the truth, come forward and spill the beans?  But what&rsquo;s even a more obvious question is: a plan like this would have to be comprised of at least dozens of people and potentially hundreds of people; why has not one person surfaced and said &ldquo;I know the whole story and it was an inside job&rdquo;.  You simply cannot keep a secret like this.  Its impossible.  For crying out loud, people leak less important stuff nearly everyday.  Surely, there would be a leaker if this were true.  But there isn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Sorry for the rant, but there is simply no evidence that 911 was an inside job and I am getting tired of explaining this to people.  I hate what Bush has done to the country more than anyone and I&rsquo;d love to get him out of office, and I think he deserves to go to jail for some of the things he&rsquo;s done, so I am not some salute-the-president happy republican here.  I think that two things contribute to people&rsquo;s willingness to buy these conspiracy theories (1) peoples&rsquo; hatred for Bush, and (2) people&rsquo;s understandable feeling that they don&rsquo;t want to believe that a few simpletons with box cutters could take down an American icon.  These two factors cloud people&rsquo;s ability to see things objectively.</p>

<p>Lastly, I am not saying that there are not unanswered questions.  I think that the 911 commission was way too easy on alot of people.  The mere fact that the president got a brief titled &ldquo;Bin Laden Determined to Attack USA&rdquo; on 08/06/2001 is evidence that these clowns were goofing around in the white house when they should have been protecting America.  At least when Clinton was getting head in the oval office, no one attacked the country.  Bush took a 6 week vacation right before both Katrina and 911!!!</p>
