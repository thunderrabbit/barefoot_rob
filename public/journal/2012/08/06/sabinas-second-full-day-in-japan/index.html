<p>Lin chose to stay at home partially because Sabina wanted to go to a bug museum, er house, er shop in Nakano called Mushisha.  We found a <em>different</em> bug shop on the same street, which was easier to find; I expect it&rsquo;s trying to get foot traffic of people who can&rsquo;t find Mushisha.</p>

<p>Sabina was all excited and begged me to let her buy one, but I was like, &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t be able to take it to the US,&rdquo; and she&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;well, will you take care of it for me after I leave?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure Lin wouldn&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really easy to take care of; they just eat jelly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Most of the bugs had little bug jello shots in their cages.  I guess that&rsquo;s what bugs are into these days.</p>

<hr />

<p>Before that, we went back to the B1 level stage and saw some really sweet instruments, costumes, and amazing music performed by a gamelan from Bali.  (I think it&rsquo;s a gamelan, and not a group called Gamelan.)  Basically all the instruments were percussion, most of which were brass(?), either like xylophones or bells of various sizes from small bowls to gongs.  Wow I want to get a CD of the music!</p>

<hr />

<p>Before that, we went to the top of the Metropolitan Government building in Shinjuku to the 45th floor observatory of the North tower.  Sabina was like, &ldquo;the city just goes forever!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;yep&rdquo;</p>

<p>She enjoyed the crazy stuff being sold in the souvenir shop, and I was like, &ldquo;but wait look at <em>these</em>,&rdquo; and showed her the shinkansen-shaped chopsticks.  i really wanted to buy some, but couldn&rsquo;t bear to spend that much on plastic sticks.  She, being in vacation mode, was like, &ldquo;these are so coool!!&rdquo; and bought them.  Nice.</p>

<hr />

<p>Before that, we saw some guys dressed like dragon-deer-bamboos, and carrying drums.  Going to see them led us to a stage on the B1 level next to the street.  We watched them perform, and then saw some really cool shaky wooden instruments being played.  I volunteered to play one of them when it was time for audience participation.  Fun times!</p>

<hr />

<p>Before that, we took the train from Kawasaki to Shinjuku.</p>

<hr />

<p>Before that, we were at home trying to figure out Sabina&rsquo;s schedule while Tariq and I worked on getting our app finished and submitted.  Turns out one must turn off png compression.  WTF would they make compression be on by default?  I sure as heck didn&rsquo;t turn it on manually.</p>

<hr />

<p>After all of that, we took Sobu Line to Akihabara where we wandered around a bit.  I was most intrigued by a physical version of the table flipping game.</p>
