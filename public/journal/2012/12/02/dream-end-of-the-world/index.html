                        <p>##07:57 Sunday 02 December 2012</p>

<p><em>In a large group of people in different buildings, I was flirting with a cute girl who looked liked she may be from India or Sri Lanka.   She had two friends, one of whom looked distinctly American, and I was flirting with <em>her</em> more.  The first girl noticed and blew me off in stride, and the second girl said to her girlfriend &ldquo;I think he likes me&rdquo; as she went out somewhere. </em></p>

<p>_I looked out the window as people started to gasp and point.  It looked like Niburu had arrived, though was moving rather slowly and perhaps narrowly missed the earth as it looked like it descended beyond the horizon.  I saw it hit the earth in a slow inexorable crash and it looked like one of the suns from a physics simulation I have on my phone.  It hit the planet on the other side of the horizon from my point of view, and there was a woman sitting on the chair looking a bit forlorn at the upcoming end of the world, and I said, &ldquo;stand up&rdquo; to her, but she didn&rsquo;t move, kinda of like, &ldquo;why should I stand up if the world is ending soon&rdquo; mixed with &ldquo;who are you to take my seat?&rdquo;  I yelled at her again until it was like &ldquo;Stand UP and Look out the WINDOW!&rdquo; as the object hit Earth (it was moving relatively slowly)  and the plume of smoke became visible from over the horizon and then the outward bound debris cloud creating more debris as everything collapsed in its path. _</p>

<p><em>People were screaming in the building and running like 右往左往 having no idea what to do.  I sat down on the floor and watched, keeping my back straight and eyes open, ready for the ride.</em></p>

<p><em>The smoke cloud came closer and went out of sight as it went under our building, and I could feel our building moving, perhaps lifting, then spinning a bit.  It felt good to enjoy the last few moments of life in such a tangible way.  Then it was all over.</em></p>

<p>the dream, that is haha</p>
