<p>OMG this is so amazing!!!</p>

<p>First, it&rsquo;s amazing that I can listen to KTRU at all on this fancy series of tubes called the internizz.   Second, Fred and I were listening to the Vinyl Frontier&rsquo;s Christmas show a couple nights ago; fun times.  but that&rsquo;s not why I&rsquo;m writing.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s amazing that MK Ultra show is still kickin&rsquo; it.  I enjoyed listening to the whole <a href="https://noise.rice.edu/ktru/sheet.nsf/15aa60c8727df106802568e90056b4d1/9b62ecd77c6ac6e386257ae300124f48?OpenDocument">3 hours played by Dijon</a>, so I called him near the end just to say HI and what&rsquo;s up from Tokyo, etc.  We chatted for a bit, mostly me asking what had changed and what has stayed the same at the station in all those years since I was there.</p>

<p>He ended his shift with a song by an artist from Tokyo, then he closed his show with something like, &ldquo;yeah that was <artist name> all the way from <strong>Japan</strong>,&rdquo; giving just a bit of emphasis to the final word so I knew he was saying HI to me.</p>

<p>I called <em>back</em>, and the next DJ (TomZ) answered.  &ldquo;Dijon?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No he&rsquo;s in the other room; how can I help you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I just wanted to thank him for the shout out to Japan; I called him from Tokyo a second ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!  You&rsquo;re the Tokyo guy! hang on&rdquo;</p>

<p>I held; I said thanks to Dijon and got his IM address.   Moments later, via text message, Dijon assured me I should listen to the next DJ, TomZ.</p>

<p>3:01 PM dijon: sup rob, thanks for listening tonight. the dude who&rsquo;s on now is crazy&hellip; i&rsquo;d keep listening for a minute if you&rsquo;re able.</p>

<p> me: With that invitation, how can I resist?? ;-)</p>

<p>  Thank you for playing even while having a bit of a cough&hellip; keeping the music moving!</p>

<p>3:02 PM if you&rsquo;re still in the staiton[sic], tell him I&rsquo;m still listening. :-) yes, he sounds a bit crazy!</p>

<p>3:04 PM dijon: tom&rsquo;s chill. i gave him the message and he threw his hands in the air in an expression of pure joy</p>

<p>After that, things went a bit crazy.</p>

<p>TomZ came on the air between songs like, &ldquo;thanks for listening Thunder Rabbit! All the way from Tokyo.  By the way, I don&rsquo;t know if you remember, but I used to rollerblade with you back in the day, so anyway, thanks for listening&rdquo;</p>

<p>WHAT?????   Holy cats my brain was like WHAT??  How can he remember that?  How can I remember him??  I met so many people inline skating&hellip;   But Google has the memory of a massive computer brain so (while Tom was playing some noise music,) I looked it up, and found <a href="https://robnugen.com/cgi-bin/journal.pl?type=skate&amp;date=1995/01/20">a skate entry, at the very bottom of which is Tom&rsquo;s name.</a></p>

<p>While texting Tom that journal entry, plus &ldquo;my wife doesn&rsquo;t like this noise music haha,&rdquo; he was on air again, confirming my previous &ldquo;WHAT&rdquo; message with, &ldquo;yeah, back in the day, we met while skating, and I was like, wow that&rsquo;s cool.. and&hellip; life goes on,&rdquo; and while he was speaking, more brain cells started to wake up in my brain, &hellip; &ldquo;he sounds like that guy who ran for City Council!  What was his name???&rdquo; and I text <em>that</em> to him, and I was right!</p>

<p>He laughed, like, &ldquo;heh.  Yeah.  Back in 19__ I ran for City Council At Large position #4, and got 19,474 votes which was 18% of the vote that year&hellip; &ldquo;  etc, &ldquo;so maybe some memories are happening..  Oh, and hi wifey who doesn&rsquo;t like noise music!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing this since then so haven&rsquo;t written back, but I&rsquo;ll send him the link right &hellip; now.</p>

<p>PS: TomZ, Lin says HI!</p>
