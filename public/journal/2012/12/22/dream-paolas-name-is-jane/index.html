<p><em>Went to Paola&rsquo;s home party with several other people there, baking cookies and yummy stuff.  I was helping Paola slice bread and put butter on it.  She was stabbing the loaf with the knife instead of slicing with the knife, and it seemed to get a bit dangerous so I stopped holding the loaf until she was done.  I pulled some first pieces off the loaf to put butter on them, and went to get the butter then came back and couldn&rsquo;t find the slices where I put them.  I realized they were under two to her slices that Paola must have stacked up on top of those.  I put them onto some foil to put them in the ofyen and Carla came in and was like, &ldquo;mmmmm&rdquo; and then I tolde her that&rsquo;s margarine, not butter and she was like, &ldquo;awwww&rdquo; and we were thinking about Carla&rsquo;s veganism and then I realized people were calling Paola &ldquo;Jane&rdquo; and as people in the other room were silent, Paola went in and said, &ldquo;you guys go ahead; I can&rsquo;t make it&rdquo; because there was too much work to do in the kitchen.  They were like, &ldquo;oh it&rsquo;s no problem,&rdquo; but some people thought it was an issue of Paola&rsquo;s perfectionism that made her not take on some large projects like building a tour through an abandoned village in a cloud forest through which we were now walking with Carla.  I climbed down the steps, testing out the rope to see if it would hold if people fell off the green mossy covered wooden stairs down which I was walking.  It held me just fine, and I turned the corner at the bottom of the stairs and found the guys were unfurling a long blue hose about 15 inches in diameter all the way down another staircase.  They inflated the hose with a fan at the top and we could slide down the hose without injury and with great speed.   The first guy tried it, but there wasn&rsquo;t enough pressure in the hose so his butt kept hitting the stairs.  I was like, &ldquo;more pressure&rdquo; and the guy turned on the fan a bit hired and then the guy on the stairs went whooosh down and hit his head on the top ridge of the tunnel near the bottom.  Oh crap, sorry, I thought cause he was too far away to hear.  The next guy went down with less incident, and then came back up using the air pressure as a rocket of sorts.  I saw the guy who hit his head and I apologized, but he said it was no problem.   I woke up before I got to slide down.</em></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to have Carla and Paola in the same dream so soon after I found out they both know Jana, whose name is similar to &ldquo;Jane&rdquo;</p>
