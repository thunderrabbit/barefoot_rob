                        <p>##00:51 Sunday 23 December 2012</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still not quite great with the caretaking.  For example, when I came up to the table to just sit, they were like, &ldquo;do you want sushi?  do you want rice?  do you want cake?  which do you want?&rdquo; and I was like, &ldquo;no thanks&rdquo; and then boom a plate appeared and food that I didn&rsquo;t want was presented.</p>

<p>Um.</p>

<p>I noticed how spoiled the kids are. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s just <em>these</em> kids, but I&rsquo;ve heard rumors and anecdotal evidence that it&rsquo;s like this for many Japanese kids. Every whine, pout, request, was immediately pandered. Ugh.</p>

<p>We can&rsquo;t touch the 9 month old baby without washing hands first. Why? Don&rsquo;t we want to build up his immune system?</p>

<p>When the 2 year old was trying to pull Lin&rsquo;s iPad away from the 6 year old who had been playing with it, I saw them doing a little tug of war. I was like, &ldquo;false,&rdquo; and simply removed it from the realm of possibility.</p>

<p>Playing hide and seek with the kids was fun, reminding me of Fred and I playing hide and seek.  But I was bemused by how entertained they were with so few places to hide.  I mean, there were three places to hide:  (kneeling under the table, standing on the lee side of a shelf, and standing behind the door of the room).  Anywhere else would be immediately visible when someone entered the room.  I showed them a fourth place to hide, made by moving the very light couch a bit forward and lying down behind that.</p>

<p>I found an excellent hiding technique which I wasn&rsquo;t able to implement: climb over a counter and through the door to the next room (which was blocked by the counter).  I couldn&rsquo;t use it because the room into which I would vanish was adjacent to the waiting area used by people before trying to find the hiders.  Hmm.</p>

<p>I wore shoes today (for the first time since May *) because it was cold, and wet, <em>and</em> I have three (3) skin splits (as opposed to shin splints?) on my left foot. My right foot is fine.</p>

<p>(* except for the day I went to get my visa, and two days I went to meet my client for business meetings)</p>
