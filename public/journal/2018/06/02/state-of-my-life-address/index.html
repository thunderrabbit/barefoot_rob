<ol>
<li>I just got home from
<a href="https://www.meetup.com/Apocrypha/events/249933126/">Apocrypha #15</a></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="09-13-saturday-02-june-2018-jst">09:13 Saturday 02 June 2018 JST</h2>

<ol>
<li>Was up too late last night and did not do much good for myself (porn), but
I on the productive side I read some of MJG&rsquo;s new book
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rots-War-Ignifer-Cycle-Book-ebook/dp/B07BCDRQDF">The Rot&rsquo;s War</a>
Ignifer Cycle Book 2</li>
<li>co-gender circle seems to have come back to meeting after a
significant dip in attendance over winter holidays</li>
<li>men&rsquo;s circle has had pretty solid attendance, often with 7 men.  I
might start tracking the <em>numbers</em> of attendees to see if there are
any useful patterns</li>
</ol>

<p>13:41 Saturday 02 June 2018 JST</p>

<ol>
<li>today I got a good start on the outer spiral for the large and
medium marbles for Marble Track 3</li>
</ol>

<p>Good grief I did not write much.</p>

<ol>
<li>Still have my MacBook Pro, like 4 or 5 years old now</li>
<li>Lin and I have lived in our house for 2 years yay</li>
<li>Jennie is good and has a cat door so she can come in and go out on
her own schedule</li>
<li>I have been talking to Kristen via Marco Polo recently</li>
<li>I have not been talking to Richard via Marco Polo recently.</li>
<li>Just met T from AB to figure out the next priorities for the
site.  Good meeting, and good to meet with them regularly.</li>
<li>I applied to &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; a symphony orchestra for some event at Muza
on July 1st.  Will find out around 15 June if I got it.</li>
<li>Still have not made any more LINE stickers beyond the first two I
made for Jennie, including &ldquo;Jennie says what&rdquo; which is no longer
for sale (Lin did not like one of the pictures) and &ldquo;Jennie says
yeah&rdquo;</li>
<li>Maybe I will make &ldquo;Jennie says Tomoko&rdquo; and have the name Tomoko
written in various ways around Jennie posed in various ways.</li>
<li>Monday noon lessons at U in Nishi-Azabu are getting better; I seem
to have found a good groove with the students.</li>
<li>dev on ConSwi for Godot has stalled in past couple of weeks. ugh.</li>
<li>Co-gender group meets on Mondays and men&rsquo;s circle meets on
Tuesdays (since early 2018)</li>
<li>I have been studying on Thursday nights with Mel in Chicago for a while.</li>
<li>I have been teaching on Sunday nights with Sarumama near Shinjuku
for a much longer while.</li>
<li>Last week I had a meeting with Michael in UK to talk about ways to create a
program for corporate team building.</li>
<li>Been going to SOGO each Sunday, and Lin&rsquo;s friend Aki has started
to come as well.  She has attended twice in past two weeks and
seems keen to continue.</li>
<li>She asked Junyu how to get more physically fit; he talked for 15
or so minutes in Japanese and I understood 80 or 90 percent.</li>
<li>I could probably say 5% or 10%</li>
<li>I have been using my waterproof Aquos phone for a while..  maybe 2
years</li>
<li>M$ is going to buy Github, which is good for the Github peeps I
guess, but likely bad for open source.  I will move my junk off to
something else.  Maybe.  Fred recently installed Gitlab on one of
his servers.  Maybe I can use it.</li>
<li>Each Monday I have been chilling in Saizeria between Nishi-Azabu
lesson and co-gender circle.  Time to head to co-gender circle soon.</li>
