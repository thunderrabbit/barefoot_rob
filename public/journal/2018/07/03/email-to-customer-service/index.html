SUBJECT: Unauthorized charges on my credit card</p>

<p>Hello</p>

<p>My name is Rob Nugen, and I am writing to ask you to remove unauthorized charges from my credit card.</p>

<p>My credit card number is (REDACTED)</p>

<p>On or around April 15, 2018, I used my credit card to do age verification for <a href="https://free-adult-games.com/">https://free-adult-games.com/</a>  The website URL and name both indicate the content is free.  I read the information written around the credit card entry form and felt assured my card would not be charged.  Otherwise, I would not have signed up because there is plenty of free pornography available online.</p>

<p>On or around May 28th 2018, I received my credit card statement which showed three different charges (even though I only entered my credit card number one time).</p>

<ol>
<li>April 17 wirescredcomp.com (866) 412-377 for $39.95</li>
<li>April 20 quotekrewbill.com (866) 324-828 for $39.94</li>
<li>April 24 payzonebill.com (877) 253-895 for $49.95</li>
</ol>

<p>I chatted with a friendly customer service agent who assured me all the charges would be removed from my credit card.  I was given a cancelation number el3168.</p>

<p>I have a copy of the transcript here:
<a href="https://new.robnugen.com/journal/2018/05/29/cancelled-porn-charges/">https://new.robnugen.com/journal/2018/05/29/cancelled-porn-charges/</a></p>

<p>This month, I have received the same set of three charges.</p>

<ol>
<li>May 16 wirescredcomp.com (866) 412-377 for $39.95</li>
<li>May 20 quotekrewbill.com (866) 324-828 for $39.94</li>
<li>May 24 payzonebill.com 866 401-9676 for $49.95</li>
</ol>

<p>I called customer service this time, and was assured they &ldquo;could only remove 2 charges&rdquo; which is insufficient given there were <em>more</em> than 2 charges <em>each month</em>, even though I had only entered my credit card number one time, on one site.</p>

<p>I ran out of credit while on the phone so was disconnected while on hold.  I went back to customer service chat.</p>

<p>I have a copy of the transcipt here:
<a href="https://new.robnugen.com/journal/2018/07/03/note-to-self-do-not-sign-up-for-porn/">https://new.robnugen.com/journal/2018/07/03/note-to-self-do-not-sign-up-for-porn/</a></p>

<p>The agent made the same assurances that all the charges have been removed.  I asked how I can trust they have been removed after I was given the same assurances last month.  The agent suggested I write to you.  Curiously, this agent gave me the same cancellation confirmation code.  el3168</p>

<p>The charges listed above were not authorized.
Please remove all the charges listed above and any other similar charges from my credit card number ________________.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br>
Rob Nugen</p>
