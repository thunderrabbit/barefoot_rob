<p>I have been writing in Japanese about the walk.</p>

<p>Behind our house there are some houses under construction.  There are
no gates blocking entry so I went inside to have a look.</p>

<p class="note">(English translations from my Japanese:)</p>

<p>Outside the houses there was scaffolding wrapped in blue fabric.  On
the first floor the fabric kept anyone outside from seeing
me inside, but on the second floor, the fabric had gaps so I was
nervous at times.</p>

<p>The houses were close together, so on the second level of the house I
entered, I used the scaffolding to cross over to the next house, via
its scaffolding.</p>

<p class="note">back to English:</p>

<p>I walked straight Where I normally turn right to go back home, but
this time it went straight and found an interesting place I have
never seen before.  I think it is a recycling plant but I&rsquo;m not
sure. It has a nicely paved pathPeople can walk on along its length,
But the fences are pretty clear about where they want people not to
go.  I didn&rsquo;t go anywhere they didn&rsquo;t want me to, but through the
hedge I took a picture of one of their trucks.</p>

<p>For a moment across my mind that it might be neat to get a job there,
but I can imagine it would get old pretty quickly.  Maybe they offer
tours that we can just see inside facility.  That would be pretty
neat, and worth checking into, but I probably won&rsquo;t do it.</p>

<p>After walking the length of their facility, I walked along the road
that had no cross streets so it seemed to be next to a river or some
other shallow valley.</p>

<p>The valley prevented me from turning right to go back toward the
house, soI ended up walking longer than I might have plans too, but it
was a pretty great walk.  On the way back I recognized that I had
walked along the street before, <em>and</em> I noticed it was next to the
recycling facility.  So I had walked next to the recycling facility
before, but I just didn&rsquo;t realize it.</p>

<p>TLDR Who cares.  3.1km walked.  the end.</p>
