<ol>
<li>I sent my invoice to Nate on time this month.</li>
<li>He&rsquo;s trying to cut costs by moving our Redmine server to a new server</li>
<li>Nate: &ldquo;This is an internal work and I don’t feel it’s fair for me to pay the cost to figure out how to move to amazon don’t U thjnk?&rdquo;</li>
<li>I am paid hourly, not a salary.</li>
<li>Tariq and I have been working on ConSwi.  I keep wondering if we should opensource it.</li>
<li>Tonight is the first Tuesday of the month, so new men are welcome to attend Tokyo Men&rsquo;s Circle.  A few have said they will come, but I always wonder how many will.</li>
<li>This is the second month of inviting new men this way.</li>
<li>I am about 90% through Brené Brown&rsquo;s book about being imperfect (I forgot the name haha)</li>
<li>I am about 30% through Brandon Peele&rsquo;s book about finding our purpose in life.</li>
<li>I am about 1% through with Marble Track 3.</li>
<li>Marble Track 3 is now into its tenth minute or so.  There is a bit of trouble at the three-way split; the small marbles have <em>barely</em> enough room to roll through the rhombus under the bamboo splitters.  I may have to lift one of the chopsticks</li>
<li>Back to barefoot every day because the weather is nice.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s Golden Week now, so we basically have the week off.</li>
<li>Haven&rsquo;t really talked to Fred as often as I&rsquo;d like.  I gotta call that lil bro a bit more.</li>
<li>Maybe I can get him on Marco Polo</li>
<li>I finished Dots and Co&rsquo;s first 550 levels and am &ldquo;waiting&rdquo; for more.</li>
<li>Been studying Japanese each Thursday with Mel in Chicago.</li>
<li>Been teaching English each Sunday with Mutsumi in Tokyo.</li>
<li>Been teaching English at SCC every other week on Wednesdays and Thursdays.</li>
<li>Been teaching English at JB on Wednesdays</li>
<li>Been teaching for ist on Mondays in Akabanebashi</li>
<li>Starting Monday will be teaching for Tess again on Mondays in Nishi Azabu</li>
<li>co-gender group meets on Mondays from 7-9pm in Nishi Azabu. (but not yesterday for Golden Week)</li>
<li>Tokyo men&rsquo;s circle meets on Tuesdays from 7-9pm in Hiroo.</li>
<li>I have found that by reading Japanese, that has been the most helpful for me to learn.</li>
<li>That and speaking</li>
<li>Speaking of speaking, I have re-started working on Soness&rsquo;s Build Your Speaker Bio and Media Sheet.  It&rsquo;s good stuff.</li>
<li>I was too late to attend Toastmaster&rsquo;s last month so will try again this month, being careful to leave on time!</li>
<li>I should probably send a link to my contact and make sure I have the right place.</li>
<li>I recently started messing with Fossil to archive my journal, but ain&rsquo;t using it consistently.  Sorta kinda stopped, tbh</li>
<li>I rarely use abbreviations while writing, except for contractions
and whatever it&rsquo;s called when writin&rsquo; an apostrophe instead of a
g.</li>
<li>5pm.  Gotta start going to Tokyo Men&rsquo;s Circle.</li>
<li>22:40pm  Great circle tonight, with one new man joining (out of 3 who said they would, and 3 others who said they might).</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been doing pushups and planks on a semi-regular basis.</li>
<li>After reading <a href="https://jamesclear.com/habits">Habits by James Clear</a>, I have some new ideas about how to build new habits. The cycle of habit forming is interesting, but the habits based on personality is even more interesting.  Instead of &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t buy junk food,&rdquo; try &ldquo;I am a person who eats healthily&rdquo;</li>
<li>Lin and I are scheduled to go do something tomorrow; I wonder what we will end up doing.</li>
<li>I wonder if gravity is part of electromagnetism.  Magnets attract over distance; gravity attracts over distance.  Electromagnetic radiation and gravity both propogate at the same speed.  Hmmm.</li>
<li>(next day)  I just spent 49 minutes redoing a single piece on Marble Track 3, and am really happy with the result.</li>
