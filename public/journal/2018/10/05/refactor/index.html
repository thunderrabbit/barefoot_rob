<p>I found a solution to all my work woes.</p>

<pre><code>I just had an interesting thought about my computer job, which I
brought up in the meeting on Monday.  My website client is AB.

It is likely that I can find a company that can do the work I am
doing for less money, but it's not possible to secretly act as a
middle man and keep the money due to how payments are done now.

The value for me overall is to reduce the load of this job, which
taxes me physically and emotionally.

Value for AB is to have a real company (Engine Yard) doing the
tedious work I've been doing, and therefore if I die, AB isn't
fucked by losing all their server/website knowledge.

I'll have to do some research, but I can probably still do the fun
part of the job and leave the annoying part to Engine Yard.
</code></pre>

<p>Yay! Why didn&rsquo;t I think of this before?  I heard of them ages ago at
an iOS meeting.  If they can handle the server stuff, that would make
my life sooo much easier.</p>

<p>So I looked up their website
<a href="https://www.engineyard.com/">https://www.engineyard.com/</a></p>

<p>Ruby????</p>

<p>Aw man!</p>

<p>I need someone to deal with PHP!</p>

<p>A couple days later, I found that someone is me.</p>

<p>I found
<a href="https://leanpub.com/mlaphp">Modernizing Legacy Applications in PHP</a>
shows how to go from spaghetti to modern framework <em>including unit tests</em>,
without any downtime.</p>

<p>My code is <em>not</em> as bad as the code in the examples, which includes
MySQL and HTML and CSS in the same file, but I definitely suffer from
lack of tests, so rely on crossing my fingers and praying each time I
deploy.</p>

<hr />

<p>While writing this entry, I found I can wrap my app in Ruby Hooks to
deploy it
<a href="https://www.engineyard.com/blog/deploying-php-applications-on-engine-yard-a-how-to">https://www.engineyard.com/blog/deploying-php-applications-on-engine-yard-a-how-to</a></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181004234913/https://www.engineyard.com/blog/deploying-php-applications-on-engine-yard-a-how-to">https://web.archive.org/web/20181004234913/https://www.engineyard.com/blog/deploying-php-applications-on-engine-yard-a-how-to</a></p>

<p>I will clean up the code first, then see what&rsquo;s up with outsourcing
the server side.</p>
