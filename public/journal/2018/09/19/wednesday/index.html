<h5 id="23-05-wednesday-19-september-2018-jst">23:05 Wednesday 19 September 2018 JST</h5>

<p>(written 14:06 Thursday 20 September 2018 JST)</p>

<p>Wednesdays are usually long for me.  Wake up at 5am (after getting
home no earlier than 10:30pm after men&rsquo;s group, but Tuesday night I
went to The Pink Cow (great to see Traci after I have been away so
long!) for an event for hemp oil that Rohini invited me to attend.</p>

<p>Anyway, got home Tuesday night at like 1:15am to find Lin sleeping on
the couch and then showered so had 3.5 hours to sleep before woke up
at 5am Wednesday, left at 5:45 am with happy tummy full of banana
smoothie Lin made.</p>

<p>Slept for an hour on the train from Noborito to Kawasaki (the train
starts in Noborito and chills there for 30 minutes before departure
(which allows a five minute window to get a seat) so I get a seat and
sleep or work on something for that hour).</p>

<p>We have been playing the camping game in my first lesson at Solid
Square.  &ldquo;I am going camping, and I will bring _____&rdquo; and other people
try to figure out what they can bring.</p>

<p>I started with an easy one, anything that starts with the letter C.
Then anything that was red.  Then Ai-chan did one of anything that can
be purchased.  Yesterday Yohei did one that was tricky for me: any
customer their company had worked for.  He started with Haneda
Airport.   Now it&rsquo;s on me again, and for fun, I started with Haneda
Airport.</p>

<p>Here is the list, as far as I can remember:</p>

<ul>
<li>Haneda Airport</li>
<li>Los Angeles International Airport</li>
<li>Mt Fuji</li>
<li>Kawasaki Station</li>
<li>(forgot)</li>
<li>Milano Airport</li>
<li>Noborito Station</li>
<li>(forgot)</li>
<li>(forgot)</li>
<li>Ranking Queen</li>
<li>(forgot)</li>
<li>(forgot)</li>
<li>Ueno Park</li>
<li>(forgot)</li>
<li>(forgot)</li>
<li>Texas</li>
<li>Shinjuku Gyoen</li>
<li>Zebra</li>
<li>Satoshi</li>
<li>Rob</li>
<li>My cat</li>
</ul>

<p>We ended there, and I hope they solve it during the week or at least
during the next lesson.  I refused to give the answer, though I did
give some hints by &ldquo;changing my mind&rdquo; about what things could be
brought.</p>

<p>After that lesson I worked in Excelsior on something&hellip; maybe on
Japanese for Marble Track 3 website.</p>

<p>I bought chocolate for the staff at SCC for my next lesson.  After the
lesson, we had a Sweets Party during which we mixed up all the
chocolates and tried to guess which flavors would be which before
biting into them.</p>

<p>Then headed to JB School for 5 lessons in 5.5 hours.  Kids lessons
<!-- (with Ryunoske, Itsuki, Taiga, Toshiro, Kanta, and Suzu)--> were pretty
fine cause we can move around a lot.  Then super sleepy in the 3rd
lesson <!-- (with Shige) --> so ate some more candy during the 4th lesson
<!-- (with Hide and Shoichi)--> and was genkier during last lesson<!-- (with
Kyoko, Kaori, and Misato) -->.</p>

<p>Walked back to Kawasaki station <!-- with Chihomi --> and then Lin
picked me up at our station.  So so thankful for her support!</p>
