<ul>
<li>Marble Track 3 has its own domain, <a href="https://www.marbletrack3.com/">https://www.marbletrack3.com/</a>
hosted as a static site on Netlify</li>
<li>ConSwi is open source under GNU copyleft.  Several outstanding issues,
the biggest of which are
<a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi/issues/25">#25 disallow dragged pieces to go through other pieces</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi/issues/23">#23 Make piece keep up with mouse when dragging</a></li>
<li>I created a
<a href="https://www.patreon.com/marbletrack3">Patreon page for MT3</a> and
have my first patron, Jimmy!</li>
<li>I recently got the fans and battery replaced on my MacBook, but it
still conks out when the battery is at 65%.  I let it run all the
way down to 0 after charging all the way, and did cmd-shift-p-r on
boot.</li>
<li>I have not been writing journal entries very consistently recently</li>
<li>Working on AB, trying to get the code base for both sites up to
snuff with MLAPHP</li>
<li>Working on TY, trying to get the new students up to speed</li>
<li>Marble Track 3 has six (6) different supports for the outer spiral,
and they each have webpages on the website, with shortlinks so I can
refer to them easily enough <a href="https://www.marbletrack3.com/p/1poss">https://www.marbletrack3.com/p/1poss</a> -
<a href="https://www.marbletrack3.com/p/6poss">https://www.marbletrack3.com/p/6poss</a>  The /p/ stands for &ldquo;parts&rdquo; as
in &ldquo;parts of the track&rdquo; and Nposs stands for the Nth Placed Outer
Spiral Support.</li>
<li>C and E have their wedding party soon (this coming Thursday)</li>
<li>Lin and I had a date tonight, eating ramen at a local cheap ramen
shop.  They deal with money by having a vending machine that
dispenses colored plastic cards which tell what we ordered.  The
cards are as thick as poker chips, but round-rectangular</li>
<li>Jennie is our cat.  She goes in and out through her cat door on the
2nd floor, which leads to the balcony and her little cat stair-bench
to the roof, to the tree, to the ground (and back).</li>
<li>The Marble Track 3 site is on version 2 now, which focuses on the
characters making the site instead of on me making the site.  I
think it is more interesting this way, but it still needs a tweak
before I am like &ldquo;yep&rdquo;.  The top page isn&rsquo;t right yet..  Currently
shows my inspiration for starting the project, but should show
<em>their</em> inspiration (or something), but I do not yet know what that
is.</li>
<li>Lucifer is in its 3rd season, so I have started watching it on Netflix, so far
not bingeing.</li>
<li>I plan to binge the hell out of Rick and Morty seasons 3 - 99 when
they are available.</li>
<li>My primary non-static web provider said my wiki dedicated to Castle
of Dreams was using too much memory.  I need to convert it to a
static site and let people edit it via git.  Fack when will I ever
make time for that?</li>
<li>Been talking to Dora about getting business started.  She introduced
me to <a href="https://www.danpena.co.uk/">Dan Peña&rsquo;s site</a> and it&rsquo;s like damn.</li>
<li>Speaking of castles, how is it that we live like royalty did back in the
day, but compared to back in the day, we still are like slaves?</li>
<li></li>
