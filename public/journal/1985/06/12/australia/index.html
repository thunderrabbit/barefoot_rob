<h1>Our Trip to Austrailia 1985</h1>

<p>It is 6:00 (Houston) 4:00 (San Fran.) Wednesday,
June the 12th.  We are on the way from Houston to San
Fransisco and we are flying over some snow capped
mountains in California.  The plane ride has been
fairly boring except when we are low enough to tell
what things are.  The trip has lasted 3.5 hours.  We
got a hotel for Ma and then jumped on the next plane
1.563 Hours later.

<p>Now It is 11:00 (Houston) 9:00 (San Fran) and Fred
and I are in the very middle two seats of a 747 (It is
awesome!)  we are about to be leaving for Honolulu. 
To bad we can't see out any windows!!  The flight
should last 4 hrs + 35 mins but I hope it is shorter. 
We just recieved some orange juice to drink or spit in
or whatever.  We will get to see a movie. ~~~~~~~

<p>(In Hotel)  The movie was dumb and Fred and I
missed supper.  We ate at burger king right down the
road and went swimming at Waikiki beach.

<p>The beach is much more fun than Galveston.  The
shore slopes down at a 40 degree angle then it evens
out a little when it hits the water.  The shore then
drops straight down about 2ft after that.  Then it
slowly goes down and out to sea.  The water is
awesomely clearer than galveston (not suprising) and
has a blue tint to it.  We saw a balboa tree which was
about 30 feet in diamater.  Too bad we couldn't
climbit!!!  There were about 200 surfboards for rent
at the beach too.  We spent the night at a hotel and
saw the Arizona memorial the next day.  It was O.K.
But not awesome.  1100 men are entombed in it and
listed as "buried at sea"

<p>We slept for a little bit at our hotel then we went
to pick up ma.  We jumped on a bus and cruised to the
airport.  We got there 3hrs before our plane was to
leave to get good seats.  We ended up getting window
seats in the smokin' section though. Then we went to
a bench and waited and waited etc for 2 hours (too
long).  When it was time for our plane to arrive we
walked a long way to the gate.  We waited until the
plane came and got to watch it being loaded and
unloaded.  When ma got out we gave her the key to the
hotel we had been in and we jumped on the plane.  When
we got to our seats some dumb lady was sleeping on
them and she wanted us to move back to her seat.  Then
some stewerdess made her move back to her seat.  We
sat down and I started to start to snooze.  I woke up
when the plane started to move and went back to sleep
again I then woke up when we were about to take off. 
I stayed awake through the take off with Fred and he
went to sleep right after we took off.  I was awake
through the midnight snack but Fred slept through it
even though I shook him and put an orange slice on his
mouth.  I went to sleep after the snack and slept
until the movie came on (2010).  I woke Fred up near
the end of it and made him stay awake till the end
when we were to eat breakfast.  We ate breakfast and
landed a few hours later.  We spent a long time in
line so we could get our passports checked.  When we
did we got on a bus and went to our hotel.  We slept
about the whole day and night.  We got Ma the next day
and went to the zoo and the opera house that day.  We
got to ride on the subway 3 times while we were there
in Sydney.  We got a camper van to cruise North to
Brisbane if possible.

<p>The first day we drove to Gosford and stopped at
koala park along the way.  We saw a little pen of
Koalas and got to pet one.  They are awesomely soft
and have two thumbs.  We got to see and pet some
Wallabies too.  They are awesomely soft and have long
teeth.  We saw some big Emus which are big, ugly, mean
birds that look like ostriches.  We spent the night in
Gosford in a place with train tracks right near it. 
Trains went by about every 10 mins.  The next day we
drove to Coffs harbor and stayed 2 nights 2.5 days. 
Our campsite was in running distance from the beach. 
The waves were huge and powerful.  I didn't dare go
past 4 foot deep water because they were too big. 
Fred and I went to our beach and went left to some
huge rocks.  We used a stick to draw a line to them. 
When we got there it was beautiful.  There were trees
and grass growing on some short mountains.  The
mountains made a little cove that was sort of hard to
get to so not too many people went there.  That meant
there was a whole bunch of rocks and shells and coral
to get.  There was a little sand dune that had about
123 sponges on it.  If you were to go right you would
get to some other rocks that were yukky.  They were
just big and mean.  I did see a maroon shark on them
though.  It was about 1 foot & 2 inches long with a
marroon back with little white spots (this big <font
size=5>O</font>) and it had a white belly.  I made a
sand fort on the beach too.  When I was done it took
26 waves for the ocean to total it.  When we left
Coffs harbour we went to a bannana plantation.  The
bannanas grew on trees.  The trees lived one year and
produced 1 or 0 bannana bunches and 1 little bannana
tree to grow next year.  In the building for the
bannana place was an operating bee hive in the store
it was closed off so no bees flew in the store though.
 They could only get out of the hive through a glass
tube leading directly outside.  after seeing the
bannana place we went to see some waterfalls.  They
were O.K.  After that we went to Armidale to sleep. 
When we woke up we went back to see the tallest
waterfalls in the Souther hemisphere.  They were 457
meters _____ feet high.  They were also to far away to
even tell that the pool that the water fell in was
rippling.  After seeing the tallest falls we drove to
musswellbrook.  We spent the night there and went to
katoomba.  Katoomba was neat.  Our campsite was not to
far from a huge valley that had many trails on it. 
There were floodlight lit waterfalls there too.  A
"skyway" went across the valley for people to ride on
and a train went down from that same building into the
valley.  We went on the train down and went on many
trails that were there.  The only bad things about
Katoomba was the Temp (Tooo cold!) and a roller
coaster.  At the same place the train and skyway were
<em>The Orphan Rocker</em> sat.  It was a roller
coaster that started near the top of the valley and
went around the skyway building through a tunnel down
into the valley and back up to the top.  The problem
it had?  It was shut down for a tune-up.

<p align=center><center><b>In Australia at the Opera house we saw a wood craft
exibition.</b></center>

<p>There were some -*<b><em><em>awesome</em></em></b>*-
things in it!!!  One project was a padlock about two
feet tall which could have its front taken off to show
its mechinism that <em>really worked!!</em>

<p>Another great project was a go-cart with wheels
that really rolled, a steering wheel that really
worked, brakes for the back that really worked,
<em>wooden</em> shocks for the back wheels that really
worked and four lugnuts that really went on and off
for each wheel!!!!!!  It was priced at $8250(U.S) and
12,5000 (Australia).

<p>The last awesome thing cost $28,500(Australia)
$18,810(US).  It was a huge table 'bout 10 feet in
diameter which had inlaid pictures of the food for
eight people to eat.  It was totally smooth but looked
3-D.  Each plate had different types of food on it and
some of them looked half eaten with the silver ware
dirty with the food.  One plate had a fish with some
hush puppies and shrimp.  Another one was a half eaten
hamburger with ketchup smeared all over.  I didn't see
the rest but they were all different.  I can't believe
the guy even wanted to sell the table.</p>
