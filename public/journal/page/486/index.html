<p>At noon on Wednesday I get off work for the rest of the week.  At noon on
Wednesday Sally gets off school and has nothing scheduled until 5:30pm on
Friday.</p>

<p>She's in Austin, and I'm totally wanting to go see her, but I have stupid
investment club meeting on Thursday 7pm, right in the middle of our mutual
time off.</p>

<p>Fuck.</p>

<p>I take this as a blessing.  There is a blessing in here somewhere I
trust.  But right now I don't see it.</p>

<p>I left a message for Dude to call me to go see <em>Undercover
Brother</em> with me tonight at 10:30, but it looks like that isn't going to
happen.  I left a note for Ellen next door, but I bet she's already
sleeping, having a 9-5 weekdays job.  Pooh.</p>

<p>I feel sad to be going back to work and stuff tomorrow after having an
Incredible Fantastic weekend with my youth and Bibby Parents in Dallas.</p>

<p class=date>10:44 pm Saturday 1 June 2002</p>

<p>Back at the Bibby's after the CYA meeting.  Paul, Sean, Tera, Jo,
Hillary, Jack.  And me.</p>

<p>Jo is on the phone though, so we are waiting until she's done to
watch pulp fiction.</p>

<p class=date>1:43 am 2-6-02</p>

<p>Just finished watching Pulp Fiction.  Joey says, "awesome," and "no
<em>you</em> shut up."</p>

<p>Sean says, "uhh, I think uh, this summer is uh, the summer of The Bibbster."</p>

<p class=message>fuckin up the way a nigga talks.</p>

<p class=date>2:20 am</p>

<p>Tired now.  Going to bed.</p>

<p class=date>12:26am Wednesday 5 June 2002</p>

<p>It's been a few days since the weekend adventure, but I'm just now
getting it written.  I brought my bike so that Sean and I could ride
around.  We joked back and forth several times, "guess what I got?"
"What?"  "A mountain bike!!"  "Really?  Me too!!"  "We should go ride
sometime!"</p>

<p>We rode out by White Lake (?) about a mile+ from his house.  I rode
on some crazy not so flat pile of rocks.  Mostly flat, but with big
wheel sized gaps between some of them.  Very hard to ride.  I also
rode dangerously on a little wall with a chain link fence on one side
and a 5 foot drop on the other.  I'm glad Sean was smart enough not to
follow.  :-)</p>

<p>I loved meeting Sean and Joey's mom.  She's quite cool and seems to
have some similar spiritual beliefs/practices as I.  I look forward to
visiting with her again.</p>

<p>Fun getting lost with Chezly and Sean on the way to drop Chez off
at her house.  I got to see her green room and we both got a copy of
her defunct band's CD single.</p>

<p>I didn't really get to talk with Hillary, Paul, Tera or Jack, but they
were definitely there.  Most def.</p>

<p>Super thanks to all the youth for a great time!</p>

<p>Oh, I almost forgot... The next day with youth sunday at First
Jefferson in Fort Worth.  I got to participate in the bridging
ceremony, which people seemed to greatly enjoy.  Talked with Katie Lu,
Laura D, Nathan Sexton, Asha, Lauren Olson, et al.</p>

<p>Josephine told a great knock knock joke:</p>

<pre>
Knock knock?
Who's there?
Brittany Spears.
Brittany Spears who?
Knock knock?
Who's there?
Brittany Spears.
Brittany Spears who?
Oops, I did it again!
</pre>

<p>On the way back to Bibbster's, I got to see all of Rick's photos of
his amazing tile mosaics and such.  Quite impressive work.  I'd like
to see some in person sometime.</p>

<p class=date>6:45 pm</p>

<p>Mmmmmm We just ate excellent Medeterrenian food.</p>

<pre>
Discussion now of Ways to Support Advisors

* Be intentional at first so it's built into the culture

* Need to have advisors register

* Have a signup list at checkin; "are you new?"

* Expand this beyond the rally: "Steve will be your mentor this year"

* CYA needs to write a script to contact the new advisor

--------

Advisor orientation at rallies:

* Maybe have a morning meeting on Saturday to orient those who came in
  late.

* Advisor meeting in the AM, Instead of at night, because it's the new
  advisors who we need to talk to anyway.

* set up a spirit committee to introduce at the adult meeting.
  Recommend: 2 local youth and 2 YAC youth and 1 local adult and 1
  district adult.

* we think new advisors should know: look up difference between
    "advise" and "lead" shared ministry

(((( Communication: how to publicize what great things were done at
     the rally? what was social action?  what was favorite game?  who
     did you meet?

     "Meet the Advisor" column in local newsletters  

     Send your youth to SWUUSI: "don't sweat it; we will"  )))))

<p>Before going to Dallas to hang out with youth and attend CYA
meeting, I talked to Ellen and Jessica. Ellen is cute!  She said, "I
think I'm moved in next to you for a reason."</p>

<p>Turns out that Ellen used to be a DJ at KTRU, and she knows the
super cute Sarah Pitre.</p>

<p>I haven't seen her since that Friday night (it's Tuesday now) I
don't know if she has not fully moved in yet or what.</p>

<p>Wow.  Okay, the last couple of days have brought some changes to my
life.</p>

<p>I already wrote that I've been asked to work only 1/2 time and get 1/2
pay from my current job.  Kristen pointed out that they didn't give me two
weeks' notice.  Oh well.</p>

<p>On the day that decision was made (Tuesday), I got home and found a
letter from Nova inviting me to interview with them to get a job teaching
English in Japan!  Awesome.</p>

<p>I called them on Wednesday and have scheduled an interview for 20 June,
my mom's birthday.  The interview (and my mom) will be in Austin.  So that
night we can celebrate her birthday and my successful interview.</p>

<p>The next day, Fred's b-day, I'll hang out with Fred cause he's also in
Austin.  Awesome.</p>

<p>The lovely thing is that I will already have these two days off from
work.  Nice.</p>

<p>Today I went by Amy's Ice Cream to apply for a job.  There were two
people ahead of me in line.  The guy behind the counter was all
WHAMWHAMWHAMWHAM on the ice cream, and making a pretty big show out of the
preparation.</p>

<p>The girl behind the counter helped the second guy.  She wasn't as
dramatic as the guy, and her customer was all, "that wasn't as cool as his,"
or something like that.  </p>

<p>She mockingly took offense and then he was all, "oh, you did a good job,"
and she was all, "oh it's too late; my heart is already bleeding," and then
to me, "may I help you?"</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> want to do a good job behind that counter," I explained.</p>

<p>"You wanna bag?" she confirmed.</p>

<p>"No, I wanna job."</p>

<p>"yeah, you wanna bag," and she pulled out a blank white bag.  "We don't
have applications.  Decorate this bag in a creative way..."  The guy went to
the back and retrieved his bag, which had cut out paper and colors on
it.</p>

<p>"Ah, very nice," I assured him.</p>

<p>The girl continued, "One person decorated her bag with doll
clothes,...."</p>

<p>and I put my hands over my ears, "no no don't give me any more ideas, " I
smiled.  I'll do a great bag.</p>

<p>As of this writing, I have painted the inside, put in the back section of
dirt, put in the big goofy dinosaur, and built the ice cream cone stand.
It's drying now.</p>

<p>Next, I'll put in the ice cream cone stand, paint an ice cream cone, put
in another section of dirt, add the second dinosaur (small and mean looking)
(he's done, but not glued inside yet) and give him a bowl of ice cream.</p>

<p>Then the last section of dirt and then decorate the outside.   I wonder
if I can get it all done tonight.  Mayyyybe.</p>

<p>Also tonight I've been in touch with Steve Feinstein, Rick Bibby, Gail
Lindsay, my mom, try to coordinate our plans for this weekend.</p>

<p>Due to financial challenges and some errors/etc at my work, I'm
being asked to work 1/2 time at work.  I can go for 3/4 time and still
make my financial obligations, but 1/2 time means I'll need to get
another source of income.  Maybe I'll work at Paint This! and get to
paint all I want and get paid for it.</p>

<p>I accept this blessing in my life with full love and joy for what
it opens up to me.  I feel sad and a bit afraid, but I know that means
I'm on the right track.</p>

<p class=date>4:44pm</p>

<p>I'm on the phone now with Jennifer; she doesn't necessarily have
work for me, but it's helpful just to know I still have friends and
options.</p>

<p class=date>1:20pm Wednesday 29 May 2002</p>

<p>So I have decided to fully embrace and love this experience.  To
confirm the goodness of my decision, I got a letter from Nova
yesterday inviting me to interview with them to get an English
teaching job in Japan!  I've confirmed an interview with them on
Thursday 20 June in Austin, which happens to be my mom's birthday!
She might not be in Austin at that time (General Assembly), but if she
<em>is</em> there, I can go to dinner, etc that evening.  The next day
is my brother's birthday, so I'll be able to chill with him in A-town
as well.  Hooray!</p>

<p>Just now leaving Denny's after tons of hugs.  I kept checking where
Suzie was in line and kept going back for hugs and goodbyes as she
wasn't done paying yet.  (I'm riding with Susie et. all. on the way
home)</p>

<p>Fred and I laughed our butts off as we relayed the stories of our
videos starring our cousins Peter and Katie from 1990 ish.  Hilarious
stuff, perfect re-enactments of the Swamp Monster skit and a brief
description of The Bead Lady skit.  Then we described the one starring
all four of us with the camera propped up on a table watching as Fred
and Katie were the dad and mom and Pete and I were the toddlers and we
re-enacted the part where Pete hit me in the back of the head and I
spit out my apple, though in this case it was my chewed up pancake.
Nice.</p>

<p>Aw dammit.  I just realized that I left my mailbag at the
restaurant.  I hadn't even read all the notes.  Or any of them
actually.  I feel sad about that, and a bit angry at myself for
forgetting it.  Mostly sad.</p>

<p>I don't even know who they were from.  Thank you all for the
blessings.</p>

<p>We're playing the dual universe silent football and Calder's
universe has just sent the football to our universe.</p>

<p class=date>5:40 am</p>

<p>this is actually working quite niely.</p>

<p>Sam just mimed the ball bouncing from the other universe into ours.</p>

<p>Only caveat  is that people are falling asleep.  Including me.</p>
