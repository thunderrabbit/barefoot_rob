<p>Wow it's later than I guessed.</p>

<p>Once Rick left, Sally and I have been talking for hours on her
couch.  So great to share stories and tell the same story of her
crisis last night from different points of view.</p>

<p>Fond memories exchanged of visiting her in Austin for her thesis
presentation and how much my presence meant to her.</p>

<p>I told her the whole behind the scenes story that was going on
during my eastern state trek.</p>

<p>Summary of my YRUU advising career, though we got sidetracked
before I could get caught up to missing San Antonio Rally.</p>

<p>hugs hugs hugs hugs hugs hugs hugs before I sent Sock Monkey to
tuck her into bed for the night.  I have a warm sleeping bag situation
on the soft couch.  So thankful for a real place to sleep tonight.</p>

                        <p class=date>6:44am MST Friday 29 November 2002</p>

<p>Good morning, Arizona!</p>

<p>It was pitch dark as I left Gage rest area, and I've slowly watched
the sky light up around me.  I can now see the idea of colors around
me, though they are night bright.  Taller bushes like 15 feet tall dot
the landscape; maybe they are juniper; I dunno.  Dry brown grassess
about 18 inches tall meet the roadway and seem to extend like a worn
carpet into the distance around all the other vegetation.</p>

<p>On my left, mountains.  And these look taller than the Guadalupe
Mountains I saw back in Texas.  Hard for me to judge how much taller
they seem, but I'll say they seem 30% taller.  And steeper to boot.</p>

<p>On my right a grove of trees.  And by grove I mean trees all
planted in countless rows.  yellow leaves and then the last three rows
had no leaves at all.  Just passed a barn labeled Bowie Vineyards or
something.  More trees now, same rows, same yellow.  Walnuts and
pecans the sign said.  Ah.</p>

<p>Okay, back to driving.</p>

<p>Oh, um, 1228 miles traveled since Dallas.</p>

<p class=date>7:23am</p>

<p>I'm 70 miles from Tucson and in front of me is a hill that we're
climbing.  Not so tall, but then way ahead are some way taller looking
mountains, and to my right are some tall-ish mountains.  Not so tall
that they've got snow on top, but they are thinking about it I'm
sure.</p>

<p>oops. 80 mph down a hill.  Not coasting.</p>

<p>The terrain is the same like a spotty puppy with brown grass for
fur and yucca plants for spots.  Almost all the yuccas have tall
stalks growing from the top, presumably for mating purposes.</p>

<p>I-10 is divided highway two lanes each direction.  Smooth asphalt.</p>

<p>Up another hill now, just about to pass Johnson Rd, which I think
leads to Johnson (the city).</p>

<p class=date>7:32am</p>

<p>Have arrived at the rest area I targeted this morning leaving my
other rest area.  1272 miles traveled.</p>

<p>Let me assure you I would love to climb these rocks just behind the
rest area, but there is a fence asking me not to.</p>

<p class=date>7:40am</p>

<p>Driving again and now the terrain is big beautifully climbable
relatively smooth boulders stack carefully about the area, with hearty
trees growing between them, bushy trees up to 30 feet tall with small
dark leaves.  Fences in front of most of the rocks that beg me to
climb them.  Sorry, rocks.  I'll have to climb some of your cousins
and second cousins elsewhere.</p>

<p>one six zero four miles traveled. Welcome to Pacisfic Standard
Time.  Welcome to California.</p>

<p class=date>5:52pm</p>

<p>Weird.  Just got waved through (along with every othe car and small
truck) through an inspection station ALL VEHICLES MUST STOP.  Wow.
Looked kinda like a military guy waving us through.  I wonder who
sponsors that station and why....  And when does it actually get used
to inspect cars and not just wave them through?<p
class=date>6:06pm</p></p>

<p>Wow.  I've just driven by a big, um, dune buggy race thing??
Something held at Imperial Dunes, with a bunch of trucks with bright
ass lights and flags driving up and down steep dunes . racing maybe or
just flat having a good time (in my estimation at the expense of the
dunes).  Plus a ton a trailers Tons of trailers and some fireworks and
fragrance of barbecue or some varietyies of food..  Wow.</p>

<p class=date>6:53pm</p>

<p>Okay.  I'm not sure if this cat was trying to pick me up or what,
but he was being all friendly like, which is no problem, but then when
he was all, "you ever seen a big truck?" and nodding over toward his
18 wheeler, I was all...  hmmm.</p>

<p>So I answered like "yeah" like seeing a truck ain't no big deal to
me.</p>

<p>And he was telling me how it's all got a bed and TV and such.  (as
I'm writing this I know he was trying to pick me up)..</p>

<p>So I was all, "well have a good trip" and split toward Scott.  He
said, "well I'm going that way, so if you get in troble, just flash me
down.." or some shit like that.  Whatever, dude.</p>

<p>His truck is the one that says "Warner" on the side, he said.
Hmmm.</p>

<p>I'm thankful that Scott will get us all the way to Sand Diego, all
through California, Oregon, everywhere we wanna go and all the way
back to Texas without a problem.  Scott rules!!</p>

<p class=date>8:54pm</p>

<p>Wow.  How incredibly exciting to be hauling ASS down a 4000 foot
hill and coating 83 miles per hour, Scott's new record!!  But so scary
to be coasting later or even braking at 75 mph with rain and wet all
over the smooth asphalt road with plenty of cars hauling their own ass
right on my ass and wow.  any slip would be instant fuckedupness for
lots of traffic.  Whew.  Made it safely to San Diego.  And even made
it to a gas station without running out of gas, all the way from
Tucson.</p>

<p>D'oh!</p>

<p>So, this is the part of my adventure where non-planning ahead makes
things interesting.  Karina isn't home; I'm guessing she is gone for
the weekend since she didn't reply to my emails today.  I left one of
my adventure cards at her door.</p>

<p>I parked Scott in a little tiny space (for me)!  Parallel parking,
aww yeah.</p>

<p>Had to pay a dollar to call Sally since my cell phone battery is
dead and neither of my chargers will charge it.  I dunno what the
problem is.  Left a message with Sally and now I'm going to drive up
almost to Los Angeles to try to find her.  I have her address, but
she's not home as of the time I called, but she often goes out, so she
could just be out on a date or some such.</p>

<p>I hate to just drop in on her with no notice; my emails still
aren't going out... so at least she's gotten one phone call.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Driving around San Diego has been exciting.  Like in Houston,
everyone drives like maniacs, and there's hills everywhere, which
makes the streets do weird things unlike in Houston.  And since it's
all new to me, and dark, and the streets are wet, it's all the more
exciting!</p>

<p>Leaving now.  1800 miles on my adventure so far.</p>

<p class=date>11:52pm</p>

<p>Holy shit.  So far I really like California.  Really Really
Really.</p>

<p>Granted, I've only seen it at night, with therefore limited
traffic, but I love the terrain!!!  And the beach is right next door!
And at any moment, the biggest earthquake ever could shake the shit
out of everything...  Wow!</p>

<p class=date>1:26am</p>

<p>I'm here; I overshot the exit a bit and had to wind my way back to
her place.  Took a long time to park, and I dialed the apt number on
the thing but no answer.</p>

<p>But then, the weirdest thing; Sally was talking to her guy behind
me; he was dropping her off and they were having a fight of sorts it
seemed.  I'm *sure* it was her, but I didn't want to interrupt their
deal, but then they drove off together.  So I'm writing this little
snippet.  I wonder if it really was her; I'll find out within no too
long I'm sure.</p>

<p>I first tried going to the library at Arizona State University, but
all the parking was tied up with a football game.  So I drove around a
bit and found the city's visitor center and they pointed the way to a
Kinko's (near the university :-)</p>

<p>Looked up Jeanette and found a biography of hers via google and
found out where she worked at the time the bio was written.  She still
works there so I asked them to call her at home and tell them her
cousin Rob is at Kinko's.</p>

<p>There's another Rob here, so I said, "Hey Rob, I'm Rob, too and I'm
expecting a phone call.  So if someone calls and asks for Rob and it's
not for you, it's for me."</p>

<p>Rock.  Google rules!!!!!</p>

<p>Kinko's free internet access rules!!!!</p>

<p class=date>9:59am</p>

<p>Wahoo!  She called and we're going to lunch.  Wheee!</p>

<p class=date>11:58am</p>

<p>So awesome to see Jeanette and meet her husband Kim!  We ate at the
Blue Willow, a pretty nice restaurant plus giftshop of ridiculous
items, mostly featuring Christmasy type stuff - ornaments shaped like
anything one wants.</p>

<p>Anyway, conversation was great; they asked a lot about my adventure
and Kim asked a bit about <a href="https://www.uua.org">UUism</a>;
Jeanette asked about why I wanted to attend Houston Rally in January.
I found it a bit hard to explain to someones who don't know the
culture.</p>

<p>Jeanette asked where I'm going next.</p>

<p>"I dunno; what's the next thing on I-10?"</p>

<p>Kim goes, "San Diego."</p>

<p>"I better call my sister..."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I learned they were married a year and a half ago; Jeanette can
cook and likes spicier food than Kim; Kim is a teacher for high school
- photography and scultping.  Awesome.  I'm guessing they met through
photography somehow; Jeanette is my photographer of choice next time I
need to hire one.</p>

<p>I'm thankful that Kim paid for my lunch, and I even have half a
samwich left over.  Eggplant on marbled rye.  Awesome.  Handshake and
hug and we went our separate ways.  They are cooking dinner for her
mom & dad tonight; they have been traveling and were driving on
Thanksgiving Day.</p>

<p>Oh, and we discussed spelling of onomatopoeia.  That's how I think
it's spelled.  I'll look it up.</p>

<p>Yay!  I was <a

<p>Holy shit I can't believe how late it is.</p>

<p>One may decide eventually that one writes too much in one's journal.</p>

<p>I left Sally's place despite concerns that I would have less of a
chance of getting a parking space; I figure as it got later on a
Friday night, more people would be coming home.</p>

<p>After turning the wrong direction and winding along a one way
narrow road around this bay, I spent several minutes lost lost lost in
lots of empty lots, looking for a lost Kinko's cause I wanted to get
internet access, but mostly because I had to poop.</p>

<p>No Kinko's in sight; nothing good at all.  Drove back to where I
saw gas stations, but they were closed (as far as their insides were
concerned).  So...  What to do, oh what to do, I gots to pooh..  </p>

<p>The Four Seasons.</p>

<p>It took a while for me to find its lighted tree lined entrance, but
once I did, I was greeted by a valet, "Good morning, sir.  Will you be
checking in with us now?"</p>

<p>"Um, actually no.  I just need to use the restroom."</p>

<p>"Not a problem.."  he gave me directions to the restroom once I got
inside.</p>

<p>Let me tell you, after being so desperate for an hour, finding the
marble floored, cloth hand towels, enormous mirrors, actual working
hot and cold water.. wow.  What a great relief.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I'm back at Sally's parking lot.  Good luck, me.</p>

<p>I've gotten my entries syncrhonized, but no pics yet.  I have a
looming feeling that they won't get done for a while.  eek.</p>

<p>Each time I've taken a picture I've thought about the entry I'd
write with it.  Pooh.</p>

<p>Just been working on Kim's website.  Closer and closer to being
done, but not done yet.</p>

<p>Going to scope out maps and may be in San Diego tonight.</p>

<p>Ah such blessed heat outside.  I hope it's warmer wherever I sleep
tonight than I've been on the past three nights.</p>

<p>Not much between here and San Diego besides I-8.</p>

<p>And a bunch of mountains a probably a lot of cactus.</p>

<p class=date>3:29pm</p>

<p>75 miles or so from Phoenix (though I'm going to take I-8 before i
get there) I'm going between these two big mountains and am overlooked
by saguaro cacti (oops I don't know how to spell saguaro yet)</p>

<p>I'm thankful for the strength of my bike rack; there is plenty of
wind whipping past at gusts are shaking my bike some.  I may take off
the back wheel as well (the fron has been off since I put it up after
riding at Carlsbad)</p>

<p class=date>3:51pm</p>

<p>I'm on I-8 now.  :-)</p>

<p>It's also a divided highway with two lanes each direction, but the
asphalt is a bit rougher grade than I-10 was.  It's not cracked, just
rough as it was designed apparently.</p>

<p class=date>4:39pm</p>

<p>1477.5 miles driven.  On I-8 now and it's vaguely dark because it's
overcast and raining.  Super thanks to Fred for giving me rain-x so I
don't have to use windshield wipers.  It just goes shwwee up the
windshield in perfect drops.</p>

<p>After I took my bike's back wheel off, I have a sense that Scott is
experiencing much less drag.  Like significantly less to the point
that I can feel the difference.  I don't know how much is "real" vs
"imaginied" (Morpheus in The Matrix: "what <em>is</em> real?  how do
you define real?")</p>

<p>Well, according to my sense of reality there are not as many
saguara (sp) cacti standing around, but the freeway is pretty straight
and flat for miles and miles between mountains.  According to the map
there is a restricted miliatary range to my left, but I wouldn't have
known it otherwise.  No planes visible.  No explosions, nothing.</p>

<p>But that's cool; I'm still rolling well and listening to Eminem and
have 91% battery on my computer.  Oh that reminds me for some reason I
can receive email, but not send email.  I used my yahoo account to
send a couple to Karina, but I did not reply to the couple of comments
I got from Aisha and Josephine to my journal entries.</p>

<p>Got one anonymous comment saying I should go to White Sands.  I've
been to White Sands and know it's beautiful.  My dad and I walked out
into the dunes and camped overnight; it was awesome.  But the penny
said don't go right now.</p>

<p>One thing interesting is that I told Kim just today that I had
gotten comments likek "ha ha" or "where are you now" or just random
thoughts on stuff, but nothing like, "you should have..." or "you
shouldn't write...." but now I have: "you should go to White Sands."
funny.</p>

<p>Now I should pt both hands on the wheel.</p>

<p class=date>5:00pm</p>

<p>Scott just turned over 150000 miles, and I've traveled 1500 miles
on my trip so far.  Nice.</p>

<p class=date>5:46pm</p>

<p>OH MY GOSH!!  How can I not have throught of this already??  Karina
is a Mac Addict through and through; she can show me some cool ass
shit with my Mac!!  I just want to know what some good graphics
manipulation programs are and maybe know if she knows of a PtP file
(music) swapping thing for Macs..  Awesome!</p>

<p>Sock Monkey dialed first with his right paw.  No answer.  He flew
around like supermonkey while the phone rang.  Then he dialed with his
tail, just for variety.  No answer.  (No variety.)</p>

<p>So Socks, Scott and I are going to go sleep down at that winding
road by the bay.  I'm thankful to have found it.</p>

<p class=date>2:58am</p>

<p>Okay.  Status: 1917 miles traveled so far.  I've been awake since
5:05am MST, so that's basically 23 hours.  In that time Scott and I
have driven (1917 - 1137 = ) 780 miles.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>

<p>Oh wait.  California, this is your big chance to really sell me on
living here by keeping me warm tonight.</p>
