<p class=date>7:01am CST Sunday 7 January 2001</p>
<p class=note>(dream)</p></p>

<p class=dream>I was inside the Chevron at the corner trying to buy
gas or something, and a woman with nothing better to do was hanging
out with the cashier all day.  In his drawer he had some donuts along
with the money, and she casually reached over and grabbed a donut to
eat.  The cashier said, don't grab anything out of the drawer,"
explaining about what if she stole money that wold be bad, etc.</p>

<p class=dream>She agreed that would be bad and said she wouldn't
steal any.</p>

<p class=dream> next moment, she was reaching over and took out two
quarters.  Just at that moment, he saw her so she did a magic trick
sleight of hand and made the quarters seem to disappear from her
hands.</p>

<p class=dream>"C'mon, I told you not to steal anything..."</p>

<p class=dream>"c'mon, just <em>try</em> to guess what hand they are
in.." she begged.</p>

<p class=dream>I casually picked up the phone and dialed 9911, but it
didn't connect.  I asked if I could use the phone, and how to dial
out.</p>

<p class=dream>"sure, just dial straight out."</p>

<p class=dream>I dialed 911 and walked outside with the long stretchy
phone cord so the woman wouldn't hear me and freak.</p>

<p class=dream>The dispatcher came on the line "Fire, Ambul.."</p>

<p class=dream>I cut her off, "pleece."</p>

<p class=dream>"Please?"</p>

<p class=dream>"no, Police"</p>

<p class=dream>I should have let her finish her question before I
spoke in a rush.

<p class=dream>"I'll connect you."</p>

<p class=dream>A little girl ran up from the parking lot.</p>

<p class=dream>"Robert, do you want to play tag with us?"</p>

<p class=dream>"In a second."</p>

<p class=dream>"Well, you're IT when you want to play."</p>

<p class=dream>"Okay."</p>

<p class=dream>I was till on hold, and I noticed they were
watching me from inside, waiting for the phone.  They were trying to
close the store.</p>

<p class=dream>I hung up on the hold music and went inside and told
them what I had been doing.</p>

<p class=dream>"now the cops are going to just show up because they
have the caller ID and will just drive up to see what's going on."</p>

<p class=dream>Hmmm.. certainly a dilemma.</p>

<p class=dream>Well, I'll be here for a while playing tag with the
youth; if they show up in that amount of time, I'll explain what
happened."</p>

<p class=dream>Turns out it didn't matter; the police drove up just at
that moment.  I bounded outside to greet them.</p>

<p class=dream>The officer looked a bit startled, so I put my hands in
plain view.  I started to speak, but it looked like they were on the
radio dispatch.</p>

<p class=dream>"Can you listen now?"</p>

<p class=dream>"Yes."</p>

<p class=dream>Okay.  It's over now, but there was a woman inside with nothing
better to do, and I witnessed her stealing two quarters out of the
drawer.  I realize it's only two quarters, but that's the point, or
it's not the point, or something is the point; she shouldn't
steal."</p>

<p class=dream>"Yeah, like if she stole your key ring, you'd quit being a customer
there and they'd lose a customer," the cop offered by example of why
she shouldn't steal even small things.</p>

<p class=dream>"Yeah," I agreed, not knowing how her example applied.</p>

<p>and I woke up.</p>

<p class=date>6:54pm CST Sunday 7 January 2001</p></p>

<p>Today I created a lovely list of things to do, including rally
planning meeting at 1pm.  I checked my email and <em>oh my
goodness</em> it was 12:15pm; I had to leave for the meeting!  I
thought it was more like 9am when I saw the time.</p>

<p>Meeting got a lot done despite ridiculous amount of interruptions
from various individuals making witty comments, and trying to change
decisions we had made several weeks ago.  Overall, everything is still
going as planned and will be perfect.</p>

<p>I chillified on the couch as Katherine (youth) ran the meeting.
I'm so proud and impressed of/with her skills.  She's doing great
stuff for the group.  Amy and Susie (youth from Northwoods) chilled on
the couch with me and it was funny as my legs were bouncing with happy
energy, and Susie sitting across me an' Amy's laps with her legs
inadvertantly being bounced.  Amy and Susie switched places after a
while and my legs just kept bouncing.</p>

<p>(Wende gets <em>so annoyed</em> at the bouncing leg thing.  I
bounce my legs because it helps me stay focused on stuff.  Sometimes I
just have so much energy!  Youth advising is definitely one of those
times.  I've heard that I burn like 500 calories per day just by leg
bouncing.  Awesome.)</p>

<p>Susie (advisor) sat by us on the couch as well near the end of the
meeting.  Ryan M joined us too.</p>

<p>So - the meeting part of the meeting appears that everything is
going super well.  I have still done very little for this rally - the
youth have done SO Much work to make this a wonderful success.  We've
received about 30 registration forms so far, and 10 confirmations
otherwise.</p>

<p>Today I added a text version of the registration form to the <a
href="https://swd.yruu.org">website</a>, and sent out an email via
Listbot to 87 email addresses on that list.</p>

<p>I'm at work, and have just begun formatting Momus (our data server) with
a new RAID 5 array.  Thanks to John for giving me a few pointers last night.
Once I got the hardware set up correctly, it was a breeze!  I originally had
all 4 drives set up as SCSI id 0, and the system hung while trying to detect
them.  I added jumpers to make them id 0-3 and presto!</p>

<p>I'm going to go ride my (borrowed) (newly updated) unicycle while the
RAID 5 formats itself.</p>

<p class=date>4:26pm</p>

<p>Whew.  I'm hot.  And I'm not just talking sexy.  The bridge is open now,
so I rode over it when I got to it and into the neighborhood beyond.  My
coolest new success: I went off a curb about 4 inches tall into a depression
about 9 inches wide and immediately up a bump 2 inches tall.  Basically I
went through the equivalent of a pot hole in the street.  It took me 3 tries
to make it across.</p>

<p>As I walked back in, the RAID 5 format was 97 percent complete.  Aww
yeah.</p>

<p>KTRU today just didn't feel right.  I didn't really care for any of
the random songs I grabbed; I only liked one track that I played: DJ
Silver "Don't Panic" a song that's an old standby for me.  I always
like it.</p>

<p>I started my show playing only artists with either one-syllable names
(like Grull), or non-word names (like MU 330), or names I'm not
allowed to say on the air (like Fuck).  This proved to be too hard a
challenge for me to do it my entire show, so I just did 1 hour of this
type of artist choosing.</p>

<p>I did play a song that other people liked.  I randomly grabbed the
12" single of Diamond D and Sadat X performing a track, the name of
which I cannot now remember.  Three people called and asked about it!
Wow.  I've had 1 or maybe 2 calls for a particular song, but this is
the first time I've gotten 3 calls about one song.</p>

<p>But overall the show just wasn't right.  The tracks just weren't
there for me.  I dunno what was the difference.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>After KTRU was ultimate!  I haven't played in SO long, but I did
pretty well considering how long it's been.  Mostly I had great throws
and a couple of good catches.</p>

<p>We played 3 games and then I went home.  The group played at least
1 more game after that.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>

<p class=date>5:47pm CST Friday 5 January 2001</p></p>

<p>Today during work:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I fixed an _ERROR_=1 problem on one of my old projects.  I'm
not sure why the error suddenly appeared, but it did, and now it's
fixed.</p></li>

<li><p>Erika, Karla and I walked to Subway to get lunch for 5 people
including ourselves.  Karla related some amazing stories of
coincidence or synchronicity.  My favorite:  Kevin worked 1 day per
week at a hospital.  Kevin's friend (call him Ralph) wanted to call
Kevin on the phone, so he dialed Kevin's normal work number to find
out what was the number where Kevin worked at the hospital.  Turns out
that Ralph misdialed the phone number to Kevin's normal work and
called the nurses' station at the hospital just as Kevin was walking
by.</p>

<p>Erika pointed out another amazing thing on the wallpaper of Subway.
On a picture of the Brooklyn Bridge, three people standing on the
bridge are Erika and her family when they happened to be walking
across the bridge.  It was difficult to make out their faces on the
bridge considering that their heads were the size of a single pixel on
the image, but it's still pretty cool.</p>

<p>On the way to and from Subway, Erika and I were reciting
various hip hop lyrics - "Baby Got Back" by Sir Mix-A-Lot and "It's
Tricky" by Run DMC.</p>

<p>Today is Erika's last day at work before she returns to school on
Monday.  We have something like a sibling relationship as we pick on
each other all the time.  She commented happily to her mom that
working with us is *finally* allowing her to have older siblings!  I
will miss her.  I gave her a big hug when she left.</p></li>

<li><p>I drove to pick up my (borrowed) (repaired) unicycle at the
Schwinn Shop.  Only $16 to repack the bearings and stuff.  I'm
guessing it was all labor charges.  I'm thankful to have it fixed
correctly.</p></li>

<li><p>After picking up the uni, I walked over to Paint This!, where
Jennifer now works (instead of The Mad Potter) where I first met her.
Just wanted to say HI and stuff so I did.  She expressed that she was
pretty tired after the holidays and that her cat Tarantuala is *this
big* now, instead of being a kitten.  Big hugs and great to see
her.</p></li>

<li><p>Renee wrote me back!</p>

<p>I first met Renee about 1993 or 1994 when I was an O-Team
(Orientation Team) Leader at UH.  She was going through orientation as
a freshmen and I was giving campus tours.  I was famous for giving 3
hour tours, literally to anywhere and everywhere on campus if someone
wanted such an experience.  If I remember correctly, Jason (not Jason
who I've mentioned lately) joined us on this tour, and Renee was one
of the "tourists."  We went everywhere and in the end, landed at a
party by the campus swimming pool.</p>

<p>She subsequently lived in The Quad and we hung out a lot one or two
semesters.</p>

<p>Anyway, I hadn't talked to or seen her in thousands of days, but I
recently got her email address from Katy (kinda via Fred) and Renee
wrote me back starting her email with,</p>

<pre>Well hello, rabbit-boy!</pre>

<p>Heeheee!!!  So cute!  She's in town; I plan to say HI to her
soon.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Tonight, Wende and I are hosting our gang's Gift Exchange Party at
our house.  Maggie just called and said they would be 30 (or more)
minutes late.  Wende says, "good," because she's not ready.  :-)

<p>The gift exchange party has been fabulous.  We
started with incredible delicacies made by Meredith,
Maggie, Molly, Wende and happy fun converstation for
all.  Dinner exceeded all the best expectations.</p>

<p>After dinner we got all the perfect gifts because
we all told the group what gift we wanted.  (Except
for Will, who wanted a total surprise and didn't
specify any gift.  He got <em>The Matrix</em> on DVD.
I asked for the latest NIN album, <em>things falling
apart</em>.  I'll use it to help me concentrate at
work.  I also got a boomerang, apparently which I had
way back in 1993 and stuff, but had left it at their
house and now it's finally gotten back to me!</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Meredith says:</p>

<p class=message>Married sex is so good!</p>

<p>Eric says</p>

<p class=message>If you're interested in uh, not just
music but criticism of music, then <a
href="https://www.heavy.com">heavy.com</a> is a little
vulgar but they do a top 10 countodown and they do
their top ten suckiest songs and rip up on the artists
and the particular song.  the whole website is flash.
that's what's cool about it.</p>

<p>I confessed to Meredith that I didn't buy her
present; Wende bought it for me.  However, I wanted to
make a something for Meredith, but didn't know what
she would want.  Now I know that she would love a hand
painted plate.  That is what I shall make for her.  I
don't yet have a design in mind.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p></p>

<p class=dream>Walking from somewhere to somewhere else, en route to
see my friends for a pizza lunch, I was walking past some stationary
railroad cars on the tracks.  The cars were mostly stationary, as they
were being disconnected and parked onto these tracks.</p>

<p class=dream>I kept being afraid that I would get kicked out of the
railroad yard by some workers, but I did not.</p>

<p class=dream>As I kept walking, the tracks were newer and newer
until they were actually not built yet, and the train engine was
rolling (and sliding some) on the dirt.  I had to stay agile and move
out of the way as it turned.  I pretty much stayed entirely off the
tracks, but now since there were no tracks, I didn't know for sure
where the train could and could not go.  I essentially stayed down
lower than where the train was.</p>

<p class=dream>Finally I was approached by a worker guy, and I told
him that I was just on my way to lunch, and happened to see the
trains.  He didn't mind and we talked about how many tracks they were
going to build.  He said 68.  "SIXTY-EIGT!!!" I almost yelled, but
then he said "68 separate rails, but actually 13 different tracks."  I
was all, "um - that math doesn't work out, unless you have 4 rails per
track."  He didn't have an answer and consulted with his friend.
Looks like they needed to do some more planning.</p>

<p class=dream>I was walking through the office of the train station
and saw a bunch of different people, including a short woman who I
picked up as I hugged her.  I bit her neck gently and she giggled.
She started licking my ear and she turned into a pig, snorfling and
licking my ear.  It felt really good, so I just kept holding her as I
walked through the office.  Karla from work commented, but I didn't
respond.</p>

<p>Something else and then I woke up.</p>

<p class=date>7:55am CST Thursday 4 January 2001</p></p>

<p>!!!  The emacs window that was doing hanoi is gone!  I showed it to
Fred last night and warned him "if you touch it, I'll kill you."
Though I didn't actually mean I would kill him, I just wanted to get
the point across that I really wanted it to continue unaffected.</p>

<p>Now the window is simply gone.  Not stopped, but just gone.</p>

<p>So, did emacs hog up too much memory and strangle itself?  Did it
get tired and quit?  This is quite disturbing to me and I would call
Fred right now, but he's probably still sleeping at our dad's house
and I really don't think he would have touched it.  But maybe he did,
cause there was a Netscape window over near the emacs window.</p>

<p>Sigh.</p>

<p>OW!!  Fuck!</p>

<p>I just hit my head on a computer.  My forehead has a big welt on it and
some blood.  People here are all "oh god" when they see it.</p>

<p>I was basically on my knees reaching underneath a desk to hook up a
computer cable and hit my head on the corner of the computer.  I reeled back
in pain and lay on the floor.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Wende happened to be there and got me ice in a napkin.</p>

<p class=date>2:52pm</p>

<p>We still had lunch for Dennis' 40th birthday today.  My head is pretty
much better now, just sore and really sensitive to touch</p>

<p>Fred is here.  I haven't seen him in a year basically - when he and
Wende and I skated downtown for the anti-climactic Y2K fizzle
celebration.  I'm not too bitter about that.  Ahem.  Okay.</p>

<p>It's been cool talkin' to him about random stuff and stuff.  We've
been doing mostly computer nerdy stuff - looking up <a
href="https://setiathome.berkeley.edu">seti@home</a> stuff and whatever.</p>

<p class=date>1:16am</p>

<p>I just told Fred the story of KTRU's week off the air.</p>

<p>Bedtime.</p>
