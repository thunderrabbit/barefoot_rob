                        <p>##05:10 Sunday 09 October 2005</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m in Jerusalem!</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t really seen anything undeniably inappropriate, but there is definitely a distinction between areas for Palestinians and  areas for Israelis, and definitely some weird stuff going on.</p>

<p>For the past two days, I&rsquo;ve been staying in Faisal Hostel, basically across the street from Damascus Gate, a portal between the Old City of Jerusalem, and the rest of Jerusalem.  The Old City is where a lot of biblical stories took place, including where Jesus was tortured and paraded through town, if I understand correctly.</p>

<p>Twice I&rsquo;ve wandered around the Old City, which seems a lot like the world&rsquo;s original shopping mall, but with churches and people with machine guns keeping us in line.</p>

<p>Once I wandered around a market in an Israeli area of town, where I was surprised to see a significant number of civilians with guns tucked into their belts.  What type of bizarro world have I reached??</p>

<p>This month the muslims are celebrating Ramadan, and last night the Israeli soldiers were 2500 strong around the Old City, controlling entrance where people were trying to go pray.  At one point the soldiers launched sound bombs to disperse the crowd that had collected near Damascus Gate.   The Palestinians hadn&rsquo;t been doing anything violent.  I had just been out there getting some food.</p>

<p>Today my friend Niveen (from Peace Boat) came to visit, and gave me her old cell phone!  She took me to get a simcard and then to the Palestinian Vision office where I met Ramy, the Middle East Coordinator for Peace Boat!  He speaks 100 miles per hour and invited me to come by anytime I&rsquo;d like to help with writing or editing.  Fantastic numbers of doors are opening for me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll stick with my original plan for now; I&rsquo;m going to be trained tomorrow and the next day by people from ISM before participating in the olive harvest.  Ramy assured me that 1 month is far too long for me to pick olives every day, and said I&rsquo;d be welcome back whenever I was done picking olives.</p>

<p>So so much to learn; so many people I&rsquo;ll be meeting tomorrow!</p>

<p>In general, this article tells me we know <em>nothing</em> about the universe.</p>

<p>Even so, I like how they&rsquo;re using the atmosphere to detect the gamma rays via Cherenkov light.  wow.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.physorg.com/news3966.html">automatic image categorisation</a></p>

<p>This seems pretty sweet.  Google could use this technology to further optimize its image search.  I could use this technology to get the pictures on my website arranged!</p>

<p>Amazing to imagine that we are now living in a time that computers <em>don&rsquo;t</em> recognize what&rsquo;s in photographs.  Seriously.</p>

<p>Wow.   I don&rsquo;t presume to know how electronic chips work, nor how magnetic chips work, but I do understand things like &ldquo;smaller&rdquo; and &ldquo;do not generate heat&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is super important to me as my computer gets scorching hot after just several minutes of being on unless I use an external fan.</p>

<p>This one looks pretty damn cool.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4292458.stm">another article</a>, Google will open up a million square feet worth of office space in NASA Ames research center.</p>

<p>My goodness it would be good to have a few hundred GOOG shares right about now.</p>

<p>Barring that, I look foward to seeing Google Mars and Google Moon.  I want to see how they represent the alien station on the far side of the moon.</p>

<p>Obviously the money belongs to Arturito.  Finders, keepers.  Too bad he&rsquo;s not sentient, yet.</p>

<p>What would a sentient robot do with $10B?</p>

<p>It sounds like too much money for it to be good news, ya know?    Papal rings???  Incan statues??</p>

<p>I seriously think it should be excavated by ARCHAEOLOGISTS, and super tight security around the whole thing.</p>

<p>There have been times that I&rsquo;ve needed lists of numbers in order.  Mostly for programming things.  Today I created such a list using emacs via a keyboard macro.</p>

<p>To use it, do M-x edit-kbd-macro and then choose a key combo.  (I always use C-x e).  Then replace whatever is in the buffer with this text:</p>

<pre><code>;; Keyboard Macro Editor.  Press C-c C-c to finish; press C-x k RET to cancel.

Command: last-kbd-macro
Key: none

<p>This awesome extension is like a dream come true for getting into free registration sites.</p>

<p>mailinator.com is quite nice, but this is even <em>faster</em>.</p>

<p>btw, mailinator has a cool new look and more functionality, such as a semi-realtime spam map, showing where the most spam is coming from right now&hellip;.</p>

<p><a href="https://robnugen.com/cgi-local/journal.pl?type=all&amp;date=2005/09/27#Star_Wars_III">Star Wars III</a></p>

<p>Nice movie.  I loved the monsters and lava and the final fight
scenes.  The classic scene of heros (fighting anti-heros) on a raft
about to go over the waterfall piqued my senses when that water was a
river of lava.  How incredible.</p>

<p>The transition of Anakin&rsquo;s body into a burned mess was quite
believable.  I can see why he would have risked attacking from the low
position, and how he fucked up doing it.  Lava burning off the suit
and not actually burning the entire body was definitely believable.
Very Jedi for Obi-wan to leave instead of kill his previous prey.</p>

<p>The transition from Darth Vader as burned mess to wearing a black
suit seemed a bit too fast.  But I enjoyed wearing the mask for a
second.  Red tints his vision forever after.  No wonder he is so
angry!</p>

<p>And man, when Darth Vader first breathed&hellip;  Woah.  I remember
that noise.</p>

<p>Not quite as amazing when he first spoke.  Not&hellip;. a believable
transition, I guess.  Too abrupt, maybe.</p>

<p>I (being a great movie director) would have had the newly costumed
Darth Vader say something like, &ldquo;shit, I can&rsquo;t feel Padme&rsquo;s presence
anywhere,&rdquo; to explain why he might agree she was dead.  She could have
just died and he just come alive and it woulda been perfect.</p>

<p>Also, I was surprised at how quickly Anakin broke his allegiance
when Mace Windu was killed.  I don&rsquo;t remember the scene exactly, but
the switcharoo seemed pretty quick.</p>

<p>How did Darth Sidious plant a code 66 in all his fighters?  Were they his
army?  That set of scenes was fuckin&rsquo; scary.  I was glad to have some
pre-knowledge of who must live.</p>

<p>I liked the explanation for why storm troopers are used in episode
IV.  Not that they didn&rsquo;t have the CGI technology in the 70s, er, the
future, but that Darth Sidious had all droids shut down.  But I don&rsquo;t
otherwise why he would do that.</p>

<p>If C-3P0&rsquo;s memory gets wiped, I don&rsquo;t get how he will recognize
R2D2 when they are reunited on Tatooine.  And why do they end up
there?  I may have missed that.</p>

<p>I liked the fight between Yoda and Darth Sidious.  It wasn&rsquo;t as surprising
as the one with Count Dooku (sp) in the previous movie, but still
cool.  I like how they didn&rsquo;t try to make it More Than the previous
fight.  They made it just the right amount of cool.  Oh, and when Yoda
walked into the room and those red cats tried to stop him but just
crumpled&hellip;  that was money.</p>

<p>In the final scene, good job on the image of Uncle Owen watching
two suns set.  Just like the first movie.  Uh, I mean the next
one.</p>

<p>Oh, and Leia really looked like Leia and Uncle Owen did too.
Great casting.  Not as difficult to find non-speaking actors, I
guess, but still cool.</p>
