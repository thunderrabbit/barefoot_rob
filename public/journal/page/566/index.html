<p>Today I stopped by Kroger on the way to work to get
some breakfast at their deli.  While I was in line to
pay, I heard, "Hi Rob" behind me.</p>

<p>It was Lynda, my first girlfriend from high school!
 I haven't seen her since we happened to be at the
laundry mat at the same time some year ago or so.</p>

<p>While I ate, we gave briefings of our latest news;
her mom is likely to move into the apartment under
her, and Lynda is about to celebrate 11th wedding
anniversary with Chris.</p>

<p>So fun to see her doing so well!</p>

<p>- - -</p>

<p>I've been at work now for a while, and am
documenting the exact state of the project so I can
explain it to Kevin this afternoon, and explain it to
myself when I get back into town.</p>

<p>I have just exchanged my blue Handspring Visor for an ice (clear-ish)
Handspring Visor at Best Buy.  Had to stand in line for a pretty long time,
but the exchange itself was quite painless.</p>

<p>Now I'm typing this entry with the keyboard as a good faith test that the
Visor will work in a happy manner for me during the entire Australian
expedition.</p>

<p>Everything seems to be working just fine.  I'm thankful for that, and I
actually kinda like the ice color.  Nice.</p>

<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>Wende and I are leaving for Australia tomorrow!
 I've had my passport since Costa Rica in November
1998.  Wende just got her passport last Thursday.  I
got our ETA (Electronic Ticket Authorities (visas)) on
Friday night.</p></li>
 
<li><p>We've started beeper duty at work.  I just had
it for a week and will give it to Dave tomorrow
morning.  It was my first duty at this work and it was
quite easy.  I think there were only 2 errors and they
were fixed by Patrick.</p></li>
 
<li><p>I just got my new (replacement) Handspring
Visor.  Its color is called "ice", and it's vaguely
translucent.  I'm using it and my Targus Stowaway
Keyboard to type this entry.</p>

<p>I replaced it because the other one was draining
batteries ridiculously quickly.</p></li>
 
<li><p>I still have not determined exactly how many
hours difference is between Houston and Melbourne.  I
want to know so I can have a dual time framework for
my entries.</p></li>
 
<li><p>I'm youth advisor for Northwoods youth group. 
Their youth Sunday is this coming Sunday, and I will
sadly miss it due to our trip.  They said they will
record it for me to watch though.  :-)</p></li>
 
<li><p>At work I have been working on making the big
big project generic so it can handle many different
surveys at once, using the same compiled code.</p>

<p>I have just given Kevin the overview of the Ritz
project, which I have made generic and called the OG
project.  That code is already written so the same
compiled code can run multiple projects.  It will be
great to see it work in production.</p></li>
 
<li><p>Wende and I have 3 cats:  Spot, my cool cat,
Tinkerbell, her white long hair princess kitty, and
Peter, her gordo tabby.</p>

<p>They are 5.5, 7, and 8 years old
respectively.</p></li>
 
<li><p>I have collected some 71 snail mail addresses
to send postcards to people from down under.  I pulled
a lot of the addresses from my old school address
books entries, so I might not send cards to them all
if it becomes too expensive.  We'll just have to
see.</p></li>
 
<li><p>I'm greatly looking forward to Silent Football
with Bryn!</p></li>
 
<li><p>Wende and I are taking Spanish classes through
Leisure Learning Unlimited each Tuesday night.  We
will miss the 5th class meeting due to our trip.  (We
were able to take the 4th class early because she's
teaching a Monday night class as well, and they are a
week ahead of us.)
</p></li>

<li><p>The walls in our living room are still white
(in our whole house actually), but we have picked up a
bunch of color samples and will paint all kinds of
wacky colors sometime in March.</p></li>
 
 <li><p>At KTRU, I am sharing the Saturday night 7-9pm
shift with Donna.  I have met her now.</p></li>

<li><p>Wende and I might get new cell phones soon. 
Cingular is our current goal because they have
unlimited customer to customer talkin'.</p></li>
 
<li><p>Tomorrow I'm taking Scott to the doctor to fix
his leaky power steering, brakes, and air conditioner.
 The air conditioner has basically never worked since
I got the car 3 years ago, and the power steering
hasn't worked for a while.  the brakes went bad after
stupid Midas shop "fixed" them, but I never went back
to complain because they still worked kinda and I
didn't want to mess with it.</p>

<p>It will be like having a whole new car!</p></li>
 
<li><p>Wende and I have outdoor christmas lights
hanging from the rafters in our ceiling for a lovely
basking glow instead of the super bright
floodlights.</p>

<p>We bought them from Melissa from Wende's work for
$10</p></li>
 
<li><p>Wende and I are meeting with a marriage
counselor to help us work out any issues before we
actually got married.</p></li>

<li><p>Okay, according to my Visor, Melbourne is 17
hours ahead of us.  So as I write this at 11:11pm
Sunday here, it's 4:11pm Monday there.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In about 24 hours we will be on a 747 in Los
Angeles going, "oh my god!  We're on a seven forty
seven!!!"</p>

<p>I have just been using my new Handspring Visor
after exchanging my old one for a new one because my
old one was draining batteries at a ridiculously fast
clip.  My thankful intention is that I'll be able to
write tons and tons of great stuff and move it to my
website once I get home.</p>

<p>I will have internet access while in Melbourne, so
I will probably write some directly to my site while
I'm there.  A great bulk of entries will be on my
Visor though.</p>

<p>I'm kinda rambling; definitely in a weird state of
bewildered excitement.  I am SO Greatly looking
forward to taking such a significant trip with
Wende.</p>

<p>We're going to stay up somewhat late tonight to
help us get on Melbourne schedule.</p>

<p>I'm in the office now and was surprised to find
someone come in saying one of our windows was broken. 
He is apparently a contractor hired by our building
owner to fix a couple of windows in the building.  We
found the cracked window and they are replacing it
now.</p>

<p>Their suction cup things are pretty sucky (good
sucky, not bad sucky) and can hold a pretty heavy
piece of glass.  Weird how they can just score the
glass and it breaks quite easily!</p>

<p>They teased me a lot about wearing no shoes. 
"Seriously, glass could cut your toes off if it
fell.."</p>

<p>Lots of itty bitty little pieces of glass bits
(they called them "picos") when they cut the glass
into small enough pieces to fit in the big yellow
trash can.</p>

<p class=date>12:15pm</p>

<p>They are done.  While all the guys were together,
testoserone and cussing was king.  At the very end,
Ray was the last one out the door.  To me he said,
"Hey, man, I do graphics design on the side, and I'm
trying to build up my business.  So if you know anyone
that needs graphics or photography let me know."</p>

<p>We talked a bit and he gave me his name and number,
so I'm passing it on to you:</p>

<p><b>Artwork and Photos</b></p>

<p><b>Ray Hicks</b>
<br>cell 713-725-1538
<br>home 281-391-4521</p>

<p>He also does custom glass and mirrors.</p>

<p>If you call him, tell him Rob, the barefoot guy
sent you.</p>

<p class=date>5:01pm CST Saturday 10 February 2001</p></p>

<p>Wende and I have just arrived home after shopping.</p>

<p>Taco Bell for lunch to kick off the whole adventure.</p>

<p>Then to SAMs, where we got AAA batteries for my Handspring Visor
and some food to help stock our respective work lunchrooms.  Wende
also got a label maker because she has wanted one for a pretty long
time.</p>

<p>Then to DSW (D-something Shoe Warehouse) to get shoes.  Ugh.  I got
a pair of leather loafers and a pair of Reebok tennis shoes.  Wende
got 2 pair of Keds ("one white because it's practical and one lime
green because it's cute!") and 1 other pair, but I don't remember
what.</p>

<p>While waiting and waiting in DSW I decided to write on my Visor.
The batteries were dead.  Uh oh.  I had just put these batteries in
like 5 days ago.  Really.  So I'm going to take it back to Best Buy
and have them replace it.  It would really suck if I wrote a lot of
fly stuff during our trip and then lost it.</p>

<p>On the way home, we spontaneously stopped by Cingular to get new
cell phones (I haven't had one for a while) because they give
unlimited free calling to any other Cingular customers, and pretty
much I just want to be able to call Wende anytime, so that works for
me.</p>

<p>But they closed 10 minutes before we got there.  Doh!!  Oh well;
we're going out of the country anyway.</p>

<p>Now at home, we're going to nap.</p>

<p>I arrived here at work around 9:30pm last night and
worked for some hours and got great coding done.  At
around 2am I was all, "Hell yeah!" and "I'm going to
sleep."</p>

<p>Slept for about 3 or 4 hours, and I've just been
reading AOL news and stuff; about to get back to
working.</p>

<p>I just called Wende to wish her a lovely day.</p>

<p class=date>7:00am</p>

<p>I just ate breakfast at the local diner.  Much much
better now!</p>

<p>I just talked to Bryn on AIM.  So very exciting to
get to see her!  I'm super thrilled that she is coming
down from Brisbane to see us in Melbourne.  We'll get
to play lots of Silent Football!</p>

<p>I'm leaving work now; not getting much done at this
point.  I'll be back in tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>I just got home and took a shower.  I had been at
work for 20 hours!  Kevin jokingly said, "well, then
you really didn't put in a full <em>day</em> of work;
just part of a day."  hahaha</p>

<p>I actually only logged about 16 hours of time
because I slept part of the time.</p>

<p>Tonight Wende and I are going to Molly and Will's
for dinner!  I think most of our gang will be there
tonight; I'm glad to get to see them again before we
leave!</p>

<p>Still going strong on my programming project today.
 Kasi got us Pizza from Star Pizza, the best pizza
place in Houston!  I only had $2, so I owe her $2.75
now.</p>

<p>I'm listening to NIN _things falling apart_ over
and over and over.</p>

<p class=date>1:51pm</p>

<p>oops.  Now I'm getting tired.  I think the pizza in
my tummy helped with that.  I may take a nap for a bit
and then write some more code.</p>
