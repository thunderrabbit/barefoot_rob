<p class=dream>I was at a UU conference including adults and youth
like GA or SWUUSI and sitting with the youth and my mom came in,
looking to me like Julia Roberts.  I asked Kate Robinson "doesn't she
look like Julia Roberts?"</p>

<p class=dream>"A little bit"</p>

<p class=dream>But no she really did look like her and then she was
looking around (my mom was looking around) and she found me and said
HI then saw some of her friends were crying and my mom started crying
and I knew immediately that meant we had started to bomb Iraq.</p>

<p class=dream>I ran outside the conference center and started
screaming until my throat was raw "GODDAMMIT MOTHERFUCKING GEORGE
DOUBLE YOU BUSH I TOLD YOU TO NOT FUCKING BOMB IRAQ!! YOU ARE SUCH A
FUCKING MORONIC MOTHERFUCKING POMPOUS ASSHOLE OF THE HIGHEST DEGREE
AND I WANT YOU TO STOP THIS WAR <em>RIGHT NOW</em>"</p>

<p class=dream>And my throat was so raw that nothing but squeaks were
coming out and I keep thinking about Ginnie's hunger strike on the
steps of the Texas state capitol.  I wonder if I could do that at the
white house?  It's fucking snowing like a bitch up there apparently;
I'd have to make it a clothing strike as well or get some clothes.</p>

<p>Rambling through my head for no apparent reason is a bit of
dialogue in <em>Snatch</em></p>

<p>"We've lost Gogeous Geoge."</p>

<p>"Yor going to hafta repeat that."</p>

<p>"We've lost.  Gogeous Geoge."</p>

<p>"Well wheahdya lose him?  It's not like he's a set of fuckin' cah
keys now is he?"</p>

<p>Over and over in my mind.  Oh, and Mickey's punch that lost
Gorgeous George and the music that ensued.</p>

<p class=date>9:09am</p>

<p>We're leaving today.</p>

<p>Things to do today:  
<br>* Check email and see if I got Laura's snailing address
<br>* get stamps and mail postcards
<br>* go climb on something rocky and tall or rocky and wet</p>

<p class=date>10:04am</p>

<p>I just heard from Jeff at Aloha Dude Internet that Google bought
Blogger.com.  Whooooooo!  I love google.  Google is the only search
engine that I've allowed to crawl my site.</p>

<p class=date>10:58am</p>

<p>Found Reen and Janette on the way home.  They were oooing and
ahhing in a fabric store when I left them.  Zachattack hasn't shown up
yet this morning to chauffeur us around the island one last day.</p>

<p>Nim from Castle of Dreams has been in touch with me recently,
saying he and Deek were thinking about old Castle days and found my
site online.  He had a bit of problem navigating around 1997 and 1998
on my site, so I might convert those years to my current format and
leave the indices intact somewhere for posterity.</p>

<p>I added bananas to my computer.</p>

<p>I just realized that Madonna's greatest hits album, <em>Immaculate
Collection</em> has got to be a reference to the immaculate
conception.</p>

<p>Hugged Zach at the entrance to the road that leads to his house
(tent).</p>

<p>We made it to the airport with some minutes to spare.  Not like in
movies where people yell, "hold the door!" or anything like that.</p>

<p>We got charged an extra day on the rental car even though Janette
was told verbally by the woman at the counter 7 days ago that it would
not be late until after 4pm.  No note in the computer of that
conversation = late.</p>

<p>I told Janette, "it's on her karma, not yours."  :-)</p>

<p>We arrived at the gate as the line was formed; no hurry had been
necessary.</p>

<p class=date>5:28pm</p>

<p>Liability laws are wack. I'm chillin' on the wall with my head in
Janette's lap and some lady wearing not a security uniform was all
"I'm with security; please come down from there."</p>

<p>I was all, "wouldn't it be funny if I fell while trying to get off
the wall?"</p>

<p>She didn't laugh.</p>

<p>Man fuck them motherfuckers who are all falling off walls and suing
the airport.  Stupid bitches shouldn't sit on walls if they're going
to fall off.  Do you know what kind of fucking walls I've climbed up
during my life and not fallen from?  Do you know what kind of slippery
waterfall blasted lava rocks I climbed on <em>today</em> and did not
fall?  Do you know what kind of head injury I sustained on private
property and not sued Jones Hall?  I paid that $4000 medical bill
myself and never cried once.</p>

<p>Fuck your wall.</p>

<p class=date>9:47pm HST Tuesday 18 February 2003</p>

<p>We're kickin' it in the airport still (Honolulu).  Boring, but I'm
transcribing old entries.  Janette and Reen went looking at goldfish
and Janette came back, "we saw a goldfish <em>this big</em>," holding
her hands out.</p>

<p>"<em>This</em> big?"</p>

<p>"No, more like this big."</p>

<p>"<em><b>This</b></em> big?"</p>

<p>"Oh, with the tail?  More like *THIS* big!"</p>

Hi guys

I am in Hawaii now and will be back in Dallas by February 20.  I will
schedule my flight and let you know the dates.

Can you check to verify that the letter was sent to my address in
Dallas?  If the letter was not sent there, then please let me know via
email what paramaters are allowable for my flight.

I'll call you guys when I get back if there are any problems.

    Thanks!

<br>I think I accidentally sent a blank comment page prior to sending this note to you.  Anyway, I haven&rsquo;t been keeping up with all of your global adventures since you met my boyfriend Jan on Southwest Airlines back in February.  I had a couple of surgeries that had me on my ass for a while.  (**Remember I&rsquo;m the flight attendant who has been having great mind-blowing sex with Jan for years :-)  It seems like you had a great time in Hawaii.  I am glad you didn&rsquo;t kill yourself.  That would have sucked.  I thought the lady from security and the wall incident was fuckin&rsquo; hilarious.  I have to agree with you on the liability law bullshit. <br>
<br>
Just wanted to drop you a few lines to let you know that I love your site.  Thanks for sharing.<br>

P.S.  By the way, Jan and his buddies from the group who performed &ldquo;Oh Sheila&rdquo; (Ready for the World) are being honored (no, not inducted; that would be awesome) at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in June. Isn&rsquo;t that great!  I get to go too.  Bye Rob!</p>

<br>This is the Hawaii I came to see. Waterfalls about 30 meters tall,
cascading from 3 distinct places, with water hitting so hard at the
bottom that the surface boils with froth.</p>

<p>Had to climb down the 30 meters from the approved parking/viewing
area, past signs saying "DO NOT ENTER" but not past the signs that say
"PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED." Those signs were at the top of the falls.
Yeah, if some cat fell from there, he'd be pretty fucked.</p>

align=left border=1></a>
<br>Speaking of cats, a cat was walking down the trail with us, and by
cat I mean a four legged feline, about 2 years old.  Mostly white with
some yellow/orange coloration.  Cute how quickly that cat could flit
down the trail.</p>

<p>Ah, Janette and Reen have just arrived at the bottom of the trail.
Zach was nice and came down slowly with them.</p>

<br>Being behind those waterfalls is one of the coolest things I've
done in Hawaii.  The wind resulting from the water falling blew so
strongly and erratically that I could spit into it and have the loogey
blow up and over my head, turn a corner and land 30 feet away.  In a
different place each time.</p>

<p>Being under that gargantuan torrent of water gushing down so hard
and thoroughly that it stung my skin til it felt like a burn, hurt my
shoulders, and gave me a headache was cooler.</p>

<p>Climbing down the *<em>slippery</em>* rocks with gusts of wind and
rain of hurricane calibre was scaaary.  I had no idea how deep the
water was below me, so I didn't know how to react if I slipped.
Should I dive and swim like a bitch or curl up and hope I didn't hit
the bottom?</p>

<p>Slipping untethered into the seasick water was scarier.  I was
standing ankle/shin/knee deep, depending on the waves as I tested the
swimability of the water.  Then my hands slipped or my feet slipped or
something slipped and I was suddenly splashing around in the water,
trying not to get bashed against the rocks with the wind and waves,
but hoping more frantically that I didn't get pulled into either
waterfall's torrent.  I reattached my hand to the rocks.  Paused for a
moment and thought, "that wasn't so bad" and pushed myself into the
tempest.</p>

<p>Swimming out, <em>between</em> the waterfalls, with cold water
blasting so hard around me that it stung my face and hurt my ears,
with waves big enough to make it hard to breathe only air, I felt flat
scared.  That was the scariest of all.</p>

<p>That's top of the line scary, with a capital Top.</p>

<p>But I knew I just had to keep swimming.  Keep breathing only air,
spitting out the water, hoping the waves would stay down while I tried
to stay up.  Keep swimming.</p>

<p>Suddenly, I was past the torrential waves, blinding rain, and into
the relative calm of the cold water.  I had made it.  I turned over to
backstroke.  Floating out on my back, gazing up at the miraculous
beauty of three waterfalls gushing down from slow motion at the top to
violent frenzied blast at the bottom, capped my Hawaii adventure.
That was it.  I had conquered these falls and now was the one and only
person floating calmly from the storm.  A water phoenix all like
"yeahhhhhhhhh."</p>

<p>And the best was knowing that people 30 meters above me, all gazing
down into the beautiful canyon, would all see me me me.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>It was so cool that I had to do it again.</p>

<p>The second time, I walked around the perimeter of the gorgeous
gorge.  I think it was easier to swim out toward the waterfalls than
walking on the slippery rocks.</p>

<p>I caught up with Janette who began her walk around the gorge as I
swam out.  She laughed and hollered at the cold windy watery blasts,
then headed back. She was on her way back as I climbed down the rocks
(a bit more quickly this time) and missed me again as I swam out.  I
was still scared as I began my swim, but I turned onto my back more
quickly this time, which meant I got blasted lightly in the face with
gusts of spray and sprinkles from the falls. </p>

<p>Wow wow wow wow.  Just as beautiful this time floating out, and I
waved up at people on the cliff.</p>

<p>Met Byron and Laurie who had come down some minutes previously.
They were from Canada / North Carolina (she), Los Angeles (he) and now
both from Palm Springs.</p>

<p>Byron gave Janette and I some animal crackers.  Mmmmm.  I gave him
two of my adventure cards.</p>

<p>We also met Coconut Man, who said he put the ropes along the trail
to help people climb down/up.  He gets them (as they are discarded?)
from ships.  The ropes used to disappear, but these current ones have
remained in place for some months now.</p>

<p>Cool.  After a day+ of being close to blind in paradise, I'm going
to visit an optometrist to get contacts.</p>

<p class=date>10:36am</p>

<p>WOW!  He knows Dr Pickering, my eye doctor in Houston!  Dr Stan
Schiller was roommates with her husband Mark at UH!</p>

<p>awesome:
<br>* he was open today
<br>* Janette drove
<br>* now I can see!</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Wow wow wow.  Stan goes kitesurfing!  That's what the sport with
cats on surfboards and the big lowercase n shaped sail above them; I
first saw this in California back when FSD sent Kevin, Patrick and me
to the SUGI conference a couple years ago.</p>

<p>Stan wrote Drs Pickering a note and sent some pages from a recent
issue of his kitesurfing magazine.</p>

<p>Met a couple from Littleton, Colorado, who live right across the
street from the Johnny Carino's (sp) that Janette and Charity
decorated somewhat recently!  How amazing.</p>

<p>They're going to hike around the Na Pali coast up on the east side
end of the road.</p>

<p>Today after Janette and I got my contacts, we joined Zach and Reen
for an adventure up on the east side, hunting waterfalls and good
stuff to climb.  Didn't find waterfalls that we could easily reach,
but did see some from a distance.  I estimated I could climb down the
cliff and to the falls in 2 hours.  As i stood on the railing
protecting tourist from falling down the hill, an old woman was all,
"that's a steep drop" and I go "yeah, I'm considering going down it."
She goes, "you're out of your mind." and I answered before I
processed/fully understood what she said, "yeah I am" cause I figured
she was saying, "no way man, you're not considering such.."</p>

<p>I'm glad to give her something to think about.</p>

<p>Zach and I made sheep and goat noises, then rooster noises.  Reen
joked about telling her mom what Zach <em>does</em> on the island, "oh
he impersonates farm animals all day!"</p>

<p>We chowed at Papaya's, oh but all that was after we visited
Collectibles, the antique store that Janette wanted to visit.  The
woman there added syllables to every sugar coated word, and she gave
to me free a pack of 9 postcards marked $2.00 because i was with
JAnette who bought several dollars worth of stuff.  She goes, "you can
have it; I can never keep track of them anyway.."</p>

<p>I may send her a card from Japan.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>We visited an arboretum and I walked through the cold creek water a
bit and overall had a fun time.</p>

<p>Got back to the hostel and Janette noticed some kitesurfers, so we
walked down with tea to watch them.  Way cool to see them flying in
the air, and one cat lost his board while in the air and
kinda splash/crashed when he landed.  He recovered though and it was
all good.  I got to help one guy with Aussie accent lower  his kite to
the ground.  Or hold it when he glowered it.  Fun time talking to them.</p>

<p>On the way back we trespassed on some closely trimmed grass and
chairs at a hotel thing and watched blinking lights blink slightly
different patterns.  white red red green white red red green would
change to white red red green green white red red green white red red
and it was really pretty entertaining, especially when we considered
the possibility of watching that pattern for like an hour and then
seeing an orange light blink once during all that time.  or blue.  I
wondered if I could make this sound very funny in my journal.  Not
really, it seems.</p>

<p>A guy was walking his dog and I could imagine a stand up comedy
routine about how dogs choke themselves to walk fast tugging on their
leash on a walk.  Crazy.</p>

<p>Got an astrological reading from Al, which was like Terminator II:
not as amazing as I had expected when I heard about it before
experiencing it.</p>

<p>He did speak rightly about some things, but some other things were
like ehhh maybe.  and easily 1/2 of it was so much like "your jupiter
is in Virgo and tarus is your moon and power and blah blah"
astrological words and crap that meant nothing to me.</p>

<p>But I kept the piece of paper that he drew it all on (my chart and
shit)</p>

<p>He does have some interesting/good things to say.  That natural
laws are not written down but they are those that persevere without
intervention.</p>

<p>Fuck.  I don't know why I feel so lost.  After we left Al's, which
part of me wishes I had before everything was finished, but he was
saying some shit like, "if every inch of your life has led you to this
point where you are at this moment, then there must be some reason for
being here." which of course applies to every moment.</p>

<p>So I started looking at the books in his library and settled down
with a comic version of Lao Zi's _The Art of War_ when Pete came back
and bang it was time to go.</p>

<p>So on the way back, I was like, "let's turn right and get lost" and
they were like okay and Reenie decided not to pretty quickly and I
felt sad that Janette was going to turn back too.  But she didn't, so
Janette and I walked more and then she said her hip was hurting so she
needed to turn back cause I was all, "I'm going to the mountain" which
was a joke since the mountain is a pretty fucking long distance away,
but truth is I didn't know how far I was going to go.  Janette was all
"ha well I better turn back" and she did.  Fair enough.  So I plodded
on, thinking I ought not turn back too cause shit I'd just be
following her, but what the fuck am I doing way out here in the middle
of fucking not no where but less than nowhere cause it's just a bunch
of houses without end and a damn mountain that I'll never reach and
nothing to see so I just kept walking, trusting there was some reason,
some something for me to experience in this moment, the final
culmination of all my life to this point.</p>

<p>So I kept walking and found that I could walk 120 steps with my
eyes closed, just straight along the sidewalk and adjusting when my
feet touched the grass.  Usually I only got to like 30 or 50 or 70
steps before I opened my eyes, but then I went like 70 and only peeked
then 50 more and looked up and saw a horse on a rope standing near the
sidewalk, which was about to turn (the sidewalk, not the horse); I
wonder how the turn would have felt to my feet; would I have trusted
them and made the turn without looking?</p>

<p>I talked to the horse without words, just stood there, sharing the
moment with him/her.  Horse didn't want to eat any grass; s/he just
looked sad, with a little callous on the face from the bridal, and I
considered releasing the horse, but didn't think I'd feel settled
about that, mucking with horse and owner karma and such.  So I blessed
the horse and continued on for some more steps, around the turn and
saw that the road didn't seem to plan to head toward the mountain
anymore so I got to an intersection, memorized the names of the
streets (and have forgotten them; silly Hawaiian names) and chose that
point to head back.</p>

<p>I counted my steps on the way back.  I let my brain just count up
to 100 at a time and then my fingers kept track in binary of the
number of hundreds.  I got back to Al's road at about 100000 (binary)
* 100 (decimal) steps.  Soon thereafter my left knee began to hurt.
1001000 (binary) * 100 (decimal) total steps to the hostel.</p>

<p>I almost got lost on the way back, misrecognized an intersection
where we cut across a road as the one where we did not cut across the
road, but before I errored, I correctly recognized a set of trees
beside which we had walked.</p>

<p>My knee was still hurting some, but I walked on grass as much as
possible.  Going down the crusty rocky pebbly hill was pretty tough
on my tenderized feet.</p>

<p>Got home to the hostel and remembered that Janette and I had
switched from our bunk to a room and I didn't know where the room was
so I couldn't just flop down and sleep or cry or whatever, and I
couldn't find a note left by Janette and no one was here except new
faces that I coudln't see and it just felt crappy.</p>

<p>I sat by Reen's bed and found the note Janette had left.  They went
to a beach I assume Reen, but Zach and Janette at least.  So I fucking
missed the beach trip in order to wear out my knee and see a horse
that wouldn't take my offer of grass and to see a mountain remain
unreachable in the distance, and to be lost in my own hostel.</p>

<p>What a poopy way to miss a beach adventure.</p>

<p>So now.  Oh and I couldn't find bread to eat and I just feel like a
big whiney pissy baby, helpless without my glasses and I'm pretty
pissed about feeling helpless and I just want to fucking avoid it all
by going to sleeeeep.</p>

<p>Or by eating a big giant chocolate bar and washing it down with
orange juice, but I just now already drank our orange juice and ate
some chocolate that I found in Reen's tub.  Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
fuck fuck this stupidness.</p>

<p>Kevin (I think) was chillin' on the hammock outside our room (I
learned from a woman named Rita where it is) and Kimberly and he were
singing songs of various genres and our room doors are the path from
the house to the hammock so the natural route is through our room to
the hammock.  Now everyone is gone from the hammock area so I am going
to close off the passage and make 'em use the back porch ramp.</p>

<p>Once I had arrived in the room, they asked before walking through,
but shit I wasn't going to say oh no now you can't walk through and
have to walk around the entire house to get off the porch.</p>

<p>I don't really know what would make me feel better, how I'll feel
reconnected with my higher self, with god.  I thought a long ass walk
on my own would do it, get away from everyone and I just find myself
wanting to be with them.  I think about going to the store to get food
and I feel too blind to do that.  Or going to do internet to upload
all these entries and I feel too blind to do that.  It's just fucking
pissy stupid that I should feel so lost without my full vision.  I
think that's what the shit comes down to; I can't see as well as I'm
used to and I feel anger/sadness about that.  Sigh.</p>

<p>Kevin (I think) told me there's an optometrist down the road.  If I
don't go down there to at least *try* and get something fixed, then I
have to stop pissing and moaning about it.  Fuck.</p>

<p>But I'm ...  I'm allowing..  I'm given the opportunity to overcome this
challenge right now.</p>

<p class=date>4:17pm HST Sunday 16 February 2003</p>

<p>Called an optometrist who's vaguely close, but who is not within
walking distance exactly, and who is not exactly open on Sundays, but
who had an after hours number and I reached his wife Sharon who tried
to be helpful, but I still need to get a ride over there.  Kevin,
James, Jessica, Karan all don't have cars; sigh.</p>

<p>I'm not really comfortable with hitchhiking if I can't see the
person into whose car I'd be stepping.</p>

<p>But the good (great?  dare I be so close to being happy?) news is
that there's a SUSHI DINNER tonight for $10 all one can eat sushi,
which is not exactly a bargain and 1/2, but maybe a great time with a
bunch of people and help the Jessica economy a bit.</p>

<p>I had another chocolate bar; I'm going across the street to get
OJ.. no I'm not; I'm going to sleep.</p>

<p class=date>6:02pm HST Sunday 16 February 2003</p>

<p>Janette just got back and guessed I walked between 4 and 5000
steps.  I haven't yet converted it from binary.</p>

<p>7200.</p>
