                        <p class=date>5:46pm EDT Thursday 3 October 2002</p>

<p>Shane just navigated me to AAA in Huntington so I could get maps of
the next states I'll be visiting.  We listened to nearly my entire
Eminem tape on the way there and back.  We are equally impressed with
Eminem's rappin' skillz and rhyming ability.  Wow.</p>

<p>Now I'm going to lay out all these maps and plan my trek.</p>

<p>Actually I need to call Steve in 13 minutes to chat about concerns
that people have that I don't have a home church.</p>

<p class=date>6:18pm</p>

<p>Talked a bit with Steve, who has been contacted by Jennifer
Nichols-Payne, who knows that Steve is the main adult at San Antonio,
and is also the chair of CYA (Committee on Youth Advisors) (I'm on the
commmittee as secretary).  JNP says that "people are watching to see
how we handle this," so he wants to help me get to the rally in a way
that does not jeopardize the CYA or himself or me or whatever.</p>

<p>He told me that he'd like to help me get there because he believes
I add to the youth community.  :-) </p>

<p>Steve asked about the situation with driving to Tulsa.  I drove
with Marta in the car, and Kate Dempsey and Jackie Purdy as well.  We
went separately because Jackie was unable to leave until after 9pm.
The rest of the Plano group went earlier with Sean and Simon Barnes'
dad driving.</p>

<p>He asked about my membership of churches, and I told him that I
have never been more than a student member of Northwoods back while I
was in high school.  I have pledged money to Emerson, but I never
signed their books as a member.  I've been advisor at Emerson, and at
Northwoods for multiple years.</p>

<p>I queried about membership in the CLF (Church of the Larger
Fellowship) and he said that may be the way to go, considering I'm in
a transitional period, etc.  It's kinda silly to consider joining the
CLF for just 4 months that I'll be in the country.  I don't give a
crap about getting the CLF newsletter or any shit like that.  I pretty
much don't want to give any money to them in such a ... can't think of
the word... what is it.. in such a fine-I'll-do-it-your-way way.  Just
to fucking fill in some beauracratic line bullshit way to console some
parents who are too fucking scared to talk to me face to face about
this.  Who are these people who are concerned?  What is their real
issue?  I'm just trying to go to two fucking more rallies and then go
to fucking Japan to inspire our beloved youth to do great magnificent
things in the world!</p>

<p>Yes I understand the need for CYA to have rules and set guidelines
and maybe all advisors should be a member of a church, even the CLF,
okay fine.. but this issue came up because of <em>me</em>.  me!
Why?</p>

<p class=date>7:43pm</p>

<p>So Steve and I tossed some ideas around, like me being co-advisor
during the San Antonio Rally.  I didn'tlike the idea of just creating
a position for Rob to fill; that seems a bit like bending rules just
for me.  He agreed and invited me to think on it some, and to write a
CYA policy as a recommendation for a guideline in the future.</p>

<p class=date>8:51pm</p>

<p>This is bizarre.  This cat (and I do mean feline, Joey) is licking
the back of my ear and side of my head.  Licking licking licking while
I'm trying to write a recommendation for CYA's approval of
advisors.</p>

<p class=date>12:01am EDT Friday 4 October 2002</p>

<p>I have written the recommendation and emailed it to Steve.  I think
it's a good start for what we're trying to do.</p>

<p>There's a part of me that is so scared to let go of my connections
to people in the world.  Like I feel driven to read livejournal
entries each day, and reply to all the emails I get (not all of them,
but all of them that are sent personally to me), and I want to keep in
touch with all my old friends from Houston and I just feel like I'm
helpless to let *something* go, but I don't want to let anything go.
And I want to write snail mails so I'll get snail mails back, and I
feel bad for not going to see Anna Magwood in Florida, but I haven't
even emailed her to say I'm not going to drive down there.  And I want
to go north to see my Aunt Madeleine, Joana, Abbey, Sford, Kniery Mom,
and somehow have time to visit Cedar Point for a day or two, plus see
where I was raised...  It's like I'm *packing* all this shit into my
life that's supposed to be a fucking <em>vacation</em> nowadays!  What
is up with this craziness???</p>

<p>I got the state maps I requested from AAA, but now I wish I had an
overview map, one of the entire US, or preferably maybe just the north
eastern states, cause putting all these maps together with their
different scales and big paper boundaries around the map makes it
difficult to figure out what's what.  Plus I don't have a map of
Indiana, and I didn't realize that Indiana is in between Illinois and
Ohio.  I thought it was the other way around.</p>

<p>Pooh.  What's under all this?  What's really bothering me?  It's
probably all the shit that's been up for the past month that I haven't
written in my public journal.  All the skeletons in <em>my</em> closet
that are still closed up, rotting and decaying in my mind.  I'm
thinking of declassifying everything maybe 10 years after it
happens.. by then people who might get pissed would probably not care
anymore, plus I wouldn't make a big deal out of it; I'd just go back
into my entries that are 10 years old and declassify them.  No
fanfare.  Someone would have to just go back into the 10 year old
entries to find out what *really* happened....  ;-)</p>

<p>No, this is not a hint that entries that are just now 10 years old
will be suddenly interspersed with juicy bits.  I don't think I really
even have entries from 1992.  All my shit was written on paper back
then.</p>

<p>There are times that I'll write about 500 characters about what
happened, but then write 3000 characters about the rest of the story.
It's all slowly coming.</p>

<p> Patience.  Faith.  Growth.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Part of it also is that I've grown accustomed to a speedy internet
connection, and I just don't have that lately.</p>

<p>I slept in my car and Shane tapped on the window.  I woke up, saw
he was carrying an invisible pistol, so I jerked up and shot him
multiple times with my 45 calibre air pistol.</p>

<p>I'm going to follow them to Barbie's house.</p>

<p class=date>2:00pm</p>

<p>David and I are being serenaded by Shane on guitar.  Shane is my
first cousin once removed, Barbie's oldest son.</p>

<p>On the way here, we went on super twisty winding roads.  Thank god
they didn't try to explain all that over the phone.  We crossed two
bridges that were one lane each, one of which is an all metal bridge,
including the surface which is a grid like the floor of the Chapel On
The Hill at Con Con 1988.</p>

<p class=date>7:12pm</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>Using google as a search engine, not just as a search
engine, but somehow even more realtime and more flexible.  Like some
way to have it return the most recent image of a certain statue (not
that statues change), or some way to have it return HTML code that
will allow the image to be imbedded in a document.</p>

<p>Something else too, but I don't know what.</p>

<p>I just slept after having wrestled a lot with Sarah, Shane's 6 year
old sister.  Part of the wrestling included her running across the
room and leaping onto me multiple times and one time her foot
basically socked (no pun intended) me in the jaw.  She's pretty darn
strong and wiggly, I could never keep her restrained very long.</p>

<p>One of our games included me lounging on the couch holding out my
hand as Sarah gallopped back and forth and back and forth alternately
dropping a shoestring into my hand and grabbing it as I let it hang
like old timey mail at the train station.  That's definitely helped
explain why she's sleeping so effectively now.</p>

<p class=date>7:41pm</p>

<p>Funny: I was talking to Becky's husband Doug (Barbie and Charlie's
parents, my aunt and uncle) and we were talking and he was all, "you
need to get up here."  "That would be lovely."  "Yeah you probably
won't get here until Friday night," then I said mockingly as if I had
just arrived on Friday night, "okay, see you guys later.." and he was
all, "okay, bye-bye," and hung up..  What?  Hhahaha I guess he
couldn't tell my mocking voice, which Marcel and I perfected during
college.</p>

<p class=date>7:49pm</p>

<p>Oh hey I just realized that I'm in a different timezone.  It's
8:49pm.  My how times flies!</p>

<p class=date>8:51pm</p>

<p>Wow it seems to have taken an hour and two minutes to reset my
clock.</p>

<p class=date>10:33pm</p>

<p>Just watched Southpark, the episode where Chinpokomon company tries
to brainwash American children to bomb Pearl Harbor.  I almost spelled
Pearl as Perl.</p>

<p class=date>12:11am EDT Thursday 3 October 2002</p>

<p>Barbie just called and said she'll be coming here tomorrow in the
AM.  I'm super looking forward to seeing her!  She's one of my
favorite cousins from back in the day.  :-)</p>

<p>Super tired.  I've been up reading a ton of livejournal entries,
and then reading my email via yahoo.  Message from Steve Feinstein
says he has heard rumors that some people are concerned about me not
having a church that I'm affiliated with and not having youth to bring
to the rally, but me still wanting to come to San Antonio Rally.</p>

<p>I plan to attend the rally, but I won't if Steve thinks it will be
a problem.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>

<p>I've had so so so so so much fun here in Memphis, from trampoline
to hot tub, concrete wall balancing to Southpark, Amelie to Sliding
Doors, rabbit to dog to cats to cat burglar.</p>

<p>I'm leaving today; I think I have all my stuff out of the house; I
don't know exactly where I'm going next.</p>

<p class=date>12:44pm</p>

<p>Okay.  This part of the trip may be the Kinko's Tour.  From a
Kinko's in Memphis I just found a Kinko's location in Nashville, right
off I-40.  That's where I'll go next.  Not sure how far it is to
there.</p>

<p class=date>12:53pm</p>

<p>$1.359/gallon for gas.  996.9 mile traveled since Dallas.</p>

<p class=date>2:25pm</p>

<p>Chillin' at a parking area now.  Been listening to my Eminem mix
tape that Janette got for me.</p>

<p>About 108 miles from Nashville now I think.  90 miles traveled so
far today.</p>

<p class=date>2:44pm</p>

<p>Okay.  I just caught up on livejournal.  Not so impressed with how
Calder quit work, but it's a pretty surprising story.  Annie's entry
had something funny in it that I forgot, and I hope Colleen finds
balance, and all the rest of my peeps as well.</p>

<p class=date>3:14pm</p>

<p>Woah.</p>

<p>I got an email today from Jimmy who paid for me-an-Tanner's lunch
on my last day or so in Tulsa.  When he wrote me, I hadn't written
about it on my site (unless he's just silly and couldn't find it), but
I'll look when I get to Kinko's in Nashville and write it if it's not
there.</p>

<p>I'm at a rest area on I-40.  I stopped because I had been wracking
my brain to figure out who had written me the email and then I finally
figured it out so I stopped driving.</p>

<p class=date>3:47pm</p>

<p>HAhaHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA 56.5 miles west of Nashville I just passed by
an exit for Bucksnort..  <em>Bucksnort!!</em> I probably shouldn't
drive with my knee and type at 65 miles per hour, but there's not much
traffic.  Plus..  Bucksnort!!!!</p>

<p class=date>4:48pm</p>

<p>Traffic in Memphis now.</p>

<p class=date>5:11pm</p>

<p>Made it to the Kinko's in Nashville that I had targeted from the
Kinko's in Memphis.  Let's see where to next..</p>

<p>Um, the restroom.</p>

<p class=date>5:34pm</p>

<p>Okay, weird, but whatever.  This Kinko's doesn't have ethernet
access; only dial-up is available.  They allow first 30 minutes free
and then $12/hour after that.  I talked the guy into giving me free
access to their computers.</p>

<p>So, after traveling east on I-40 for 200+ miles, my next plan is to
travel east on I-40 for 200+ miles.  Way exciting!</p>

<p>not.</p>

<p>But hey it's been fun to drive from overcast not quite flat Memphis
to drizzly foggy not quite mountainous Nashville.  Plus I got to see a
sign for Bucksnort!  And some signs for Loretta Lynn's restaurant.  Oh
yeah I'm sure she's in the back cookin' up eggs or serving them.
Better go there quick to see her!</p>

<p class=date>5:59pm</p>

<p>Got some gallons of gas for $1.289 per gallon.  210 miles driven
today so far.</p>

<p>Oh, and I noticed a greater percentage of women with lots of makeup
on.</p>

<p class=date>7:05pm</p>

<p>Raining pretty effectively now.  It's not a cold rain, but
definitely wet and not too warm.  I'm at a rest area and have just
slid all the way down the pebble sidewalk on my Adidas sandals.  Not
in one slide, but yeah.</p>

<p>While in the rest area, I overheard a woman ask for a nearby
campground.  It's apparently $12 or $13 per night, but I will probably
just sleep a few hours and not even really get out of my car.</p>

<p class=date>7:35pm</p>

<p>Well, it quit raining and I'm glad for that.  Super hilly and dark
and damp and foggy getting to this camp place.  I'm parked at the
laundry room area, and I'm not sure if cars are supposed to park on
these wooden decks off the road, but it sure does look that way.
Wednesdays are free to use the facilities.  I did go through a gate
that could be closed (at 10:30 pm?) so I hope it's not when I want to
leave.</p>

<p>Potty now and then sleep.</p>

<p class=date>9:48pm</p>

<p>Yahaa!  Awake and now go.</p>

<p class=date>10:02pm</p>

<p>Made it past the gates and now I'm out of the park area.  Thank you
Edgar Evins State Park!</p>

<p class=date>12:54am CDT Wednesday 2 October 2002</p>

<p>I drove past Knoxville and didn't know it because I was talking to
Wende.  I did notice a city, but didn't realize it was the city I had
been looking for until I noticed no more signs indicating how far away
it was.  Now I'm in a Holiday Inn looking for internet access to look
up a Kinko's.  I tried a Super 8 first, but they had no internet
access at all.</p>

<p>Fun names that I've passed that I remember:</p>

<p>Pigeon Forge
<br>Douglas Dam</p>

<p>There was another but I don't remember it now.</p>

<p>I've driven around 400 miles today.</p>

<p class=date>1:11am</p>

<p>440 miles.  I didn't find internet access at Holiday Inn either,
nor even an employee at the desk.  So I'm just parked in the back to
take a nap.</p>

<p class=date>5:47am CDT Wednesday 2 October 2002</p>

<p>Awake.  Talking to my dad to get phone numbers of his fam to see
where I'm going to stay next.</p>

<p class=date>5:56am</p>

<p>Gottem.  Thanks so much, dad!  My phone charger is worth the $5 I
paid for it; I'm using yarn from the Tulsa Rally worship to hold it
securely in place on my phone so it will charge.</p>

<p class=date>6:01am</p>

<p>Just talked to Becky (my dad's younger sister); now I know where to
go: Barbersville.</p>

<p>Sure is foggy outside.</p>

<p class=date>6:46am</p>

<p>Adding to the list of fun city names: Jonesborough (sister city to
Jonesboro AR of course)</p>

<p>I'm wearing sweat pants and my hoodie now. I seem to have left my
jacket in Memphis.</p>

<p class=date>8:08am</p>

<p>100+ miles driven today.  550 miles since Memphis.  Just passed an
exit for Saltville, VA, certainly a sister city to Sugarland, TX.</p>

<p class=date>8:36am</p>

<p>Just stopped to P and get a few gallons of gas at $1.299.  571
miles since Memphis.  Sweat pants and hoodie off and into the back
seat.</p>

<p class=date>8:43am</p>

<p>Big hills mostly coated in trees, looking like a model railroad
mountain covered in lumps of shades of green.  Rocky outcroppings form
a wall on either side of the highway unless I'm driving by a big
valley looking over a grassy tree coated plain.  No flat ground here.
Sky is mostly cloudy with bits of sun peeping through.  Sometimes in
the median of the freeway a blanket of white, pink, purple flowers
decorate the ground.  Nice.</p>

<p>Groseclose is the next winner of the funny names contest!</p>

<p class=date>9:06am</p>

<p>Dammit I just stabbed my straw into a red Gatorade juice box,
slurped a few slurps and then for fun blew into the straw, inflating
the box and then it squirted juice out the straw onto my shirt and
shorts!  D'oh!  and Hahah that's pretty funny in a not so funny way.
At least it's a dark shirt.  Not that I won't wear a well stained
shirt.</p>

<p class=date>9:13am</p>

<p>Turned north on I-77, went up a big hill and then through a
<em>tunnel</em> through a mountain!  Wow!!  Now truly we just went
under the "top" of the mountain, about a mile or a tad less of actual
tunnel.  Wow.  I think it's so exciting to me because I remember being
amazed and impressed to go through tunnels (that same one??)</p>

<p class=date>9:29am</p>

<p>Another tunnnel!!  "East River Mountain"</p>

<p class=date>10:55am</p>

<p>Okay mr tollman I'm out of money!  Since I got on highway 77, three
times $1.25, incuding two Sacajawea dollars and the dollar that
Janette gave me in my box o' goodies.</p>

<p class=date>11:36am</p>

<p>310 miles today; 754 since Memphis.  Eminem blasting.  I can rap
part of some of the songs.  I forget which ones.  I'm tired.  Stopped
at a rest area now.</p>

<p>I grabbed two more Sacajawea dollars out of the zipper bag on my
bike in case this damn tollway never ends.</p>

<p>At the rest area, they have free maps and a brochure from a glass
blowing company, which made me think of Hillary.</p>

<p class=date>1:03pm</p>

<p>Have arrived at Barboursville about 20 minutes ago.  Yikes.  What a
small town.  Half of the people I see know half of the people they
see.  One makeup girl in a small Camaro type car looking depressed in
the passenger's seat, didn't even look up when her boyfriend got in
the car.  Barely looked up when they drove off with another sporty car
with huge engine.  High school age or so.</p>

<p>One girl behind the counter at this BP is <em>so thin</em> that I
immediately think she's anorexic.  She has eyebrow piercings and long
sleeve everything.  Doesn't make eye contact with me as I walk up to
the counter, even to see if I need help. (I didn't, I just wanted to
see how thin she was.  wow.  please eat something.)</p>

<p>Called Becky who should be here soon.</p>

<p>As a service to the household, I cleaned out hair from the shower
drains as Lisa prepared food and Julie came home and we walked the dog
while Julie practiced piano, and we picked up Hannah at school and
took Julie to her paino lesson at Rhodes College during which Hannah
Bannannah and I trekked over to the cafeteria type thing and munched
hot dogs & french fries (her) and onion rings & orange-cream frozen
yogurt (me).  I walked in barefoot.  I kept expecting to be kicked
out, but was not.</p>

<p>By the time we were done eating, Julie and Lisa walked over after
the piano lesson and we all chatted.  Hannah and I started a King of
the Wall game, on the 15 inch wide, 2.5 foot tall wall around the
courtyard of the cafeteria.  I could (not entirely easily or safely)
beat her every time just with my bigger size, so we played Phat Pat's
whoever-moves-their-feet-first-loses game, where each player can only
touch the other player's hands.  We were much more evenly matched at
that, and had to spice it up with ninja sound effects and psych-out
starts: "ready... go!" and both pull our hands away to make the other
fall forward.  That never worked, but we sure did try it a lot.</p>

<p>Watched the sun go down behind the trees, while sharing a slurpee
with Julie, then I tried to get mono by eating the rest of Hannah's
ice cream, got some frozen yogurt for Addie, we did cartwheels on the
way back to the car.  Cartwheels and round offs.  I did a couple of
cartwheels while holding my computer in one hand.  I like how light
and durable it is.  What a wonderful great day!</p>

<p class=date>7:29pm CDT Monday 30 September 2002</p>

<p>Just hugged and said bye to Hannah, Addie, Julie, who are at their
dad's house for the night; I'm leaving the big city of Memphis in the
AM.  Tonight Lisa and I are going to watch the second episode of
Southpark on Volume 10</p>

<p class=date>10:33pm</p>

<p>After dropping off the kids at their dad's, Lisa and I went to get
Pulp Fiction and I told her no fewer than 8 eight of my long jokes
(very short versions with lots of "blah blah blahs") and even told a
couple while we were in Hollywood Video and the woman was registering
Lisas's account since they were the only one that had Pulp Fiction
(Two different Blockbuster's did not) and we got ice cream and she got
me an apple and baby carrots for my trip (for which I'm super
thankful) and um, oh we got home and ate ice cream and watched the
second episode of Southpark on Volume 10 and are ready to watch Pulp
Fiction now.</p>

                        <p class=date>11:01am CDT Sunday 29 September 2002</p>

<p>I'm in my own church, outside with nature, sitting upon some
discarded sections of sidewalk dumped into a ravine angling steeply
into the mighty Mississippi River.</p>

<p>This spot is nearly underneath a monstrous iron bridge that has
borne the loads of many trains crossing the river.  I look up and see
a layer of rust and paint covering  huge erector set beams with rivets
speckled across everywhere.  Countless XXXXXXXXX form the beams to keep
them light yet strong.  I wonder how I can get up there.</p>

<p>I see below me a wooden bridge holding up a lush carpet of green
that has taken root in a mass of leaves converted to dirt over the
years.  Looks like an old railroad bridge that travels alongside the
river, not across it.</p>

<p>Below that is the enormous granite base holding the larger grander
bridge.  I see a ladder on that base near the top.  I don't know if
the bottom of this ladder will be accessible, but soon I shall find
out.</p>

<p class=date>11:26am</p>

<p>Wow.  I see (saw) evidence that the wooden bridge had been burned
pretty effectively.  I don't see any close that say if this was before
or after it was recomissioned from bridge to garden.</p>

<p>Climbed down quite a pile of rocks, each on the order of a cubic
foot or three, and all pretty sharp and not particularly stable.
Tricky bare feet get me to the river's edge safely.</p>

<p>Huge barge of 30 big barges being pushed by a barge pusher named
Charles C Ottorff or something like that.  Lots of waves after that
and I notice white stuff floating in the water, some easily
identifyable as cans and bits of trash, some are probably bubbles
churned up by countless boats and pollution in the water.   The muddy
river looks like a deep tan leather color with hazy blue sky
reflecting on it.  Cannot see any more than about 2 inches into the
murky brown.</p>

<p>Many beer cans litter this area, along with what looks like some
plastic bags, shirts, wire, paper, styrofoam, the 12-pack cardboard
case for this beer to be carried down and thoughtlessly discarded into
this otherwise beatiful natural spot with lush vegetation carpeting
the rocks down to within 30 feet of the river, about 10 feet above the
water's surface now.</p>

<p>Even the city itself has condoned littering, with the sidewalk
tossed into the ravine, and hundreds of concrete core samples taken
from concrete who-knows-whats.  5 inches in diameter, round cylinders
about a foot to 18 inches long.</p>

<p>As I write this, I hope my description might be useful to
archaelogists or historians who are researching this area.  Too bad
that I don't really know where I am in terms of the names of this
section of Memphis, but I'm sitting on a concrete conglomerate formed
as a spillway about five feet wide and fifteen feet long ready to
guide water from a 20 inch concrete pipe just on the upstream side of
three bridges.  The bridge furthest upstream holds two railroad
tracks, one with a train coming from Arkansas to Memphis right now as
i type.  it's on the upstream-most track, as the other track has some
railroad cars resting on it ever since I've been here today.  The next
bridge down holds only 1 railroad track, and has a train traveling
from Memphis to Arkansas now.  Easy over one hundred grain cars, all
like twins holding hands across the entire river.</p>

<p>I do know that I'm sitting below the Unitarian Church of the River,
if that gives you a sense of where I am.</p>

<p>Ooh. the train above me is stopping.  Very interesting.</p>

<p>So, um, the next bridge is for vehicular traffic, cars and trucks
and more cars and trucks.  I can see the Wlecome to Arkansas sign
above the roadway on that bridge, presumalby with a Welecome to
Tennessee sign opposite it.  (It's the I-55 bridge)</p>

<p>The grain cars are still going.  Now they have ended.  Maybe 200
cars there.</p>

<p>A tree is floating down river, stuck maybe on a section of rocks
that juts a bit further out into the river.</p>

<p>Across from me trees cover the entire bank, with only a single
barge, and 3 radio antennae towers marring the landscape (not
counting these three huge bridges).  The towers are painted with red
and white sections, as is customary since I've been alive.  I am
guessing the trees are mostly oak, with a few pine.</p>

<p>I shouldn't forget to mention that well upstream from me is the
"new" traffice bridge that Lisa said is I-40 crossing the river.  It
is mostly flat with two hump backed arches supporting the bridge over
its longer sections, designed to allow mongo barges past.</p>

<p>The train above me has sarted again and stopped again since I've
been typing.  The tree has dislodged itself and gently floats toward
me like a weightless astronaut with no schedule to keep. </p>

<p>A man in purple shirt, pants, and *shoes* (I'm barefoot) carries a
camera and tripod over toward me, mostly with his eyes on the rocks
below him (smart) and the river and bridges.  We acknowledge each
other with a nod and slight wave.  He's photographing maybe the train
or bridge or something.</p>

<p>Talked to Randy, who develops his own black and white photos at
home and works in a color photo lab.  He said he was photographing
anything at all, so I showed him the charred bridge.  I wonder if
he'll put that on his website.</p>

<p>So Lisa and I are here at Mud Island, which is not actually an
island, but an over commercialized penninsula.  Not like a damn
shopping center, but a boat launch for kayaks and airboats and paddle
boats and plenty of water related activites.  I felt pretty cynical
towards all that so I didn't want to go kayaking as we had planned,
but I was willing to wade through the model of the Mississippi river
that spans nearly a couple hundred yards in length.  Most fun has been
two different sets of (model) rapids, where we used our feet to create
a dam and watched the water backwash after we let our flood go.  I
vaguely have a sense of the physics that I imagine are involved, which
I explained as best that I could.</p>

<p>I sat my butt in the river basin to block it, but didn't make the
water as impressively deep as I had hoped.  But my butt still got
pretty wet.</p>

<p>The next set of rapids, beside which we are sitting now, we were
much more effectively able to block, to the point that the styrofoam
boat race up river was stalled until we let it go.  I don't think the
participants knew of the blockade ahead of them, and I didn't even
think about them when we blocked it, but after we let the river go
again, they seemed to start moving down river again more quickly.</p>

<p>Lisa suddenly went philosophical about cause and effect and affects
that we cause without our awareness.</p>

<p>This is bizarre.  And I have no camera!  Maybe it will stay long
enough for me to get a picture later.  My phone display is perfectly
reversed top to bottom.  Like the exact image of </p>

<pre>
D   Cingular   13:32




Menu           Names

<p>is mirror imaged upside down.  And I just tried typing a phone
number and not surprisngly that didn't change the upside downness of
it.  How bizarre!</p>
