<p>Today at work was much better than I thought it might be.  I
basically would just wing every class, doing no preparation except
choosing a lesson number beforehand.  I mentioned this to one of the
guys there, like "man I got this shit <em>down</em> - just winging the
whole operation."</p>

<p>And he's like "you don't really want to say that on your first
day."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Over confidence," he said as if it were two words.</p>

<p>Dude.  Whatever.  If I got this shit down, or at least think I do,
then fuckin' whatever.  Yeah I told him.</p>

<p>Actually I didn't say anything but made a mental note to not tell
him anything interesting anymore.</p>

                        <p class=date>11:21pm JST Friday 4 April 2003</p>

<p>Today was <em>packed</em>.</p>

<p>Janelle & Kevin plus Dru were already at the park by the time I
arrived.  I thought I was late, but tons of people came after me..
Mindy, Emma, Chris, Shehan, then at the very end, Robbie, someone
else... durnit </p>

<p>ANYWAY, the cherry blossoms were in full bloom and quite
beautiful.  Imagine a park covered in trees and all the trees blooming
white with small blossoms, delicate and fragrant.</p>

<p>The ground was mostly covered with blue tarps, with a few families
using them for picnic type things.  The tarps remained clean as
everyone removed their shoes before stepping onto them.</p>

<p>Janelle & Kevin brought sheets for us to use and we got some
giggles from those around us.  We moved to a tarp, but got gently
booted off cause we had not paid to use it.  We were moved under a
short cherry blossom tree with pink blossoms.</p>

<p>Turns out this tree is like <em>the</em> cool tree in the place
cause tons of people came to photograph it.  Japanese girls across
from us wrestled and shrieked and giggled and fell all over each other
in drunken revelry. One of the tarp dwellers across the tree from us
came over with a bottle of sake.  He was all pointing to the blossoms
and saying the name in Japanese (which I've forgotten), like
"<em>cherry blossom :: sake</em>!!" holding up the bottle, and poured
us all some sake to celebrate the cherry blossom in full glorious
bloom.</p>

<p>Over the next hour or so they offered us plenty of sake, Jim Beam
whiskey "Amelican!", donuts, white knit gloves, and maybe other
stuff.  So friendly and so great!</p>

<p>THEN some guys came over with a big TV camera all smiling and
friendly and the guy was like, "nihongo?" to ask us if he could
interview us in Japanese, but we were like, "no" and he goes, "oh,
English only" and therefore proceeded to ask Emma (the only female
among us five guys) a simple question that seemed to be about the
cherry blossoms.  She was all, "oh they are beautiful; I enjoy them
everyday," and then moved on to the next tarp for some Japanese
interviews.  We fucked with Emma like, "oh, he was asking you about
the salarymen," or "what if he was asking you about earthquakes or
tsunamis?" or some shit like that.  Funny.</p>

<p>Janelle, Kevin, Emma, Mindy, Shehan and I went down by a bunch of
booths to explore the offerings (mostly food).  Immaculate and careful
presentation.  A waffle iron to make waffles out of batter, except the
batter was the same as for fortune cookies, and the waffle iron made
little cat and dog shaped waffles. So cute!!</p>

<p>We had fucking cool bottles with a marble for a lid, er a cap that
gets pushed into the bottle to open it.</p>

<p>We played a card drawing drinking game.  I drank orange drink.  Ace
is for avalanche, two is for you, three is more me, four is for
whores, five is to the right, six is for dicks, seven is to the left,
eight is a something else, nine, blah blah blah.  Fun-ish game, but
silent football is far better.</p>

<p>As the original group was leaving for the evening, Robbie and
friends came and we all walked around the park.  All those who
remained in our group.</p>

<p>Robbie taught me by example that it's okay to have fun with
Japanese.  "Campai!" he yelled to a group of salarymen on a tarp, and
within a minute he was sitting with them, being offered a full glass
of sake.  Like a five ounce glass from 7-11 (we call it 7-11 Sake).
Such a magic word Compai..  It means cheers or get schnockerd or the
like.</p>

<p>We took lots of pictures and one guy was all extravagantly miming a
home run in baseball.   Crraaazy stuff.</p>

<p>More walking until we found a fire juggler who spoke relatively
good English.  He could identify as Aussie my phrase "no worries
mate," and was a good juggler to boot.  Fun pictures of that.</p>

<p>Robbie was infatuated with the concept that they were allowed to
drink out in public.  "80% of these people are *drunk*," he explained.
"We could *never* do this at home!"  So we got a picture of him
carrying a beer and posing with two cops.</p>

<p>On our way home he said "compai!" to a girl next to me on the
train.  They ended up having a long conversation.  Fuck being shy.  i
can do this.</p>

<p class=dream>"It's a charley barley barely burger"</p>

<p class=dream>My friends and I had through it would be fun to ride on
the back of the truck as our boss was driving to Tennessee or
someplace hopefully not so far away.  The truck had started out as
trains and we were testing our train boarding skills.  I had been able
to barely climb up the slick stainless steel outer casing of the
train, but somehow I did it.  I held on for a while, but it became
apparent I wouldn't be able to do this the whole time.</p>

<p class=dream>So we opened the doors more and I climbed in with my
friends onto the futons and other soft things loaded into the back of
the truck.  The back doors swung open and some of our stuff fell off.
I was all, "oh shit our stuff is falling off!" and I jumped off to go
rescue it.  Like a couple sleeping bags, and a purse (although who
needs sleeping bags with so many futons?)</p>

<p class=dream>The truck was driving quite slowly, though I didn't
know how much longer it would be driving so slowly.  I ran away from
the truck, grabbing two sleeping bags, and tossed one up.  It almost
made it through the small gap between the futons and the edge of the
door.  I tried again and made it.  I tossed the other bag up as well,
and then ran further away from the truck to recover my friend's
purse.</p>

<p class=dream>I had a distinct feeling that our boss driving the
truck would be able to see me in the rearview mirrors since I had run
so far back behind the truck.</p>

<p class=dream>Grabbed her purse anyway and ran back toward the truck.
But the truck turned toward the left, making me clearly visible in the
mirrors, so I dropped down prone on the floor to make myself less
visible.  He turned right (back away from me again) and I thought I
was okay.  But then I realized he was just swinging around to U
turn.</p>

<p class=dream>I was caught.  I lay on the ground with my friend's
purse and another bag as the huge 18 wheeler drove slowly toward me.
At this point, the game was up; I didn't try to hide what I had been
doing, nor try to implicate my friends; maybe they could still get
away.</p>

<p class=dream>I ended up at the main office, with no way to get home,
but I had called my dad for help.  After a while a woman came in.</p>

<p class=dream>"Rob?  This is from your dad [to help you get home]."
She held three items: bag of cookies, stack of bologna, stack of white
bread; she placed them down one at a time on the table beside me.  "He
said to tell you it's a 'Charley,' 'barley,' 'barely burger'"</p>

<p class=dream>Good pun there, dad.  Not.</p>

<p>I'm in Tsunashima train station waiting for a train to Ueno, where
I'll meet Janelle, Kevin, Andrew to ooh and ahh over cherry blossom
trees.  I expect they'll be quite lovely, but I wonder if they will
meet my expectations...</p>

<p>I chatted with Janette (& Sean a little bit (& Josephine a very
little bit)) and Marcel this morning.  Janette and I had set up an
electronic date just for chatting.  Good stuff.  Got the latest on the
Dallas-YRUU front.</p>

<p>Here's my train.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Okay; I'll take this train to Shibuya (one of the big stations on
the train-track-loop around Tokyo) and then take the loop to the
opposite side (almost exactly according to this not-to-scale map) of
Tokyo to Ueno (another big station on the loop around Tokyo) where I
hope I can follow the directions in Janelle's text message (the phones
here are one's dream or nightmare).</p>

<p>Haha I just wrote a message to DruDaddyG and spelled Shibuya with
hiragana instead of romanji.  Man, talk about fun!  My ideas of fun
have certainly changed......</p>

<p>I told Dru that I'm going to SHIBUYA and he's all, "why are you
going to SHIBUYA, we are going to UENO" (and the station names (all
caps here) were in hiragana) so I wrote back</p>

<p>dammit</p>

<p>I was so entertained with myself that I left my phone on the other
train.</p>

<p>I wrote the message, laughing to myself at how fucking funny I am
and put the phone between my legs for safe keeping while I wrote the
entry.   Got up off the train...  left the phone.</p>

<p>Maybe if the little fuckers weren't so small!</p>

<p>I'd be willing to bet more money that I'll get my phone back than
bet money I'll love the cherry blossoms today.</p>

<p>I hope I can fin.....</p>

<p>I had put it in one of my lower pants pockets.</p>

<p>I was going to say I hope I can find Dru et. al.</p>

<p>Woke up feeling grrr and spiteful about going to work.  "I'll show
him and fucking spend *!<em>EXACTLY</em>!* ten minutes on each of the
four parts of each lesson" and be all BAM show you motherfucker that I
can keep to a schedule</p>

<p>or basically *skip* a section altogether but make the rest of the
lessons <em>SO PERFECT</em> that the students are leaving all
"whutwhut!" so happy and learning so much just to fucking prove to
Stevey that timing can bite the big one and still have an awesome
lesson.</p>

<p>and then I'm all, <em>breathe.  take it easy, big guy</em> etc and
then I read several LJs that I downloaded last night.</p>

<p>Now that my LJ reprieve is over, I'm all grrr again.  </p>

<p>Take it easy big guy.</p>

<p>Killa.  Finished OJT today and today went much better than
yesterday.  I think I can do this.  Steve is still too jolly for my
own good, and makes fucked up jokes, sometimes meaning to be joking,
but it came across badly a couple times..  Whatever.</p>

<p>My first lesson's timing went flawlessly; I kept to the clock so
well; Steve was my observer so that was convenient.</p>

<p>The ohter lessons varied in how well they stuck to the NOVA
timekeeping schedule, but all went well.</p>

<p>Benny knows a cat from Canda (he's (Benny is) from Canada) who is
DJing tonight, so we're going there.</p>

<p>I'm thankful to have not required using an alarm in the morning.
I've finished my homework (second day of OJT); now I'm going in search
of a post office to snail to Colleen and snail a postage paid thing to
get the hookup on my calling card.  This will let me recharge it at
Lawson's and give me 5 minutes of free calling.</p>

<p>Today was a bit fucked up at work because the lesson that felt the
best where the students had the most fun and talked most with one
another, I got negative feedback on because I hadn't followed the Nova
approved method.  </p>

<p>Fuck that fucked up bullshit.  Are these motherfuckers trying to
learn English and become comfortable speaking it or do they care about
making sure they hit steps 1, 2, 3, 4?  </p>

<p>This was the class after which they thanked me most profusely,
where they spoke the most English..  Grrrrrrrr</p>

<p>But just *one* more day of OJT and then I won't be watched by
hawks, or by the jolly good Steve from England who, bless his heart,
really likes working at Nova.</p>

I know what you mean about doing what you call a good job teaching--based<br>
on the smiles and success of your students--and then have your superiors <br>
turn around and give you a poor review because you didn't do it Their Way.<br>
When she said that she didn't like what I did, I was so furious I could <br>
hardly see straight.  When I got back to my office, it was all I could do <br>
not to rant about her, and loudly, in the most colorful terms possible; <br>
I would have, too, but two of my students were waiting for me there.  <br>
I had to excuse myself for about ten minutes while I calmed the fuck down.  <br>
They knew I was pissed, though, and they knew exactly why.  <br>
<br>
My recommendation to you first and foremost is that you lean heavily on <br>
those teachers who you trust for advice.  Second, try to remember that <br>
while you are in fact being paid to teach Their Way, there is always <br>
flexibility, since people are different.  <br>
<br>
I have to say that here in the beginning, you should try your very best to<br>
evolve a teaching method that is within the Nova Way, but has a style you<br>
find natural and are proud of.  After a while, if you're not satisfied, <br>
begin to favor your own style at the expense of the Nova Way.  Keep the <br>
letter of the Nova Way as much as possible, though.  <br>
<br>
At that point, if someone official comes to you and says they don't like <br>
something you did, you have good grounds for defense:<br>
(i) they like you,<br>
(ii) they've seen you do it Their Way,<br>
(iii) you utilize the letter of Their Way--*which is all they can require*,<br>
(iv) you are doing the best you can.<br>
Also, in the particular case of whatever it was you "did", you can talk <br>
about the specific details of the situation, and no one will be able to fault<br>
you for your decisions, because you make good decisions, and you're doing the <br>
best you can.  <br>
<br>
In my own situation, I basically told the person to fuck off, because I knew<br>
I couldn't be fired, I knew I would never be working in that program again,<br>
I knew the person reviewing me wasn't very important, and I knew that spending<br>
the hour spoon-feeding that one student (neglecting everyone else) was more <br>
important than the official method of "force them to swim".  <br>
<br>
Good luck, G, and as Dad told me once, you have to give a new job at least a <br>
week before giving up.  <br>

<br>Oh, and forward that back to me so I can have it for posterity.<br>
<br>
PPS: The button to send this form says, "Submit Query".<br>
I think it should say "Submit Comment" or something like that.<br>
