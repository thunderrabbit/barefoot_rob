<p>I have gone through all the themes in the repo for
<a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoThemes">All Hugo&rsquo;s Themes</a> and come
up with a list of several which do a lot of these things:</p>

<ul>
<li>content on top page</li>
<li>list page for blog/</li>
<li>list page for journal/</li>
<li>paginate blog/</li>
<li>paginate journal/</li>
<li>show tags</li>
<li>paginate tags</li>
<li>show categories</li>
<li>paginate categories</li>
<li>nicely show Youtube videos</li>
</ul>

list so far:</p>

<p>Slept a lot because sick, but I spent some time on getting my site
theme figured out.</p>

<p>Today was the second time for Akiko and I to do a language exchange.
She had some good ideas for
<a href="https://www.marbletrack3.com">Marble Track 3</a> and how to market it.
I may end up creating another Instagram account; that is apparently
the way to go these days.</p>

<p>So happy to get another subscriber on Youtube, and enthralling to see
her enthralled with the process of animating the construction!</p>

<p>For example, when she watched how I made the part with Spoonhead and
Candy Mama lifting and sending small orange marbles down the Triple
Splitter Small Feeder, she realized that the marbles have to be placed
in exactly  spots in order to appear to be rolling.  She also asked
the very important question: do marbles really roll down the track?</p>

<p>Great question, and yes.</p>

<p>JB got me 8 hours of lessons at BP over the 4 Thursdays in June.  This
was the 3rd lesson, during which we practiced taking taxis, ordering
in a restaurant, and something else.</p>

<p>Yoko M wasn&rsquo;t there, but she will be back next week.  Yoko N
volunteered a couple of times to go first!</p>

<p>But localhost cannot even load the page which shows all the tags.
Dang.  That must be a lot of tags.</p>

<p>I got 1.5 hours of livestream done on MT3 and about an equal amount of
work done on AB.  Plus spent time ostensibly studying Japanese by
watching Kakegurui in Japanese.  (Season 2 now has subtitles in English.)</p>

<p>Anndd had a nice nap.</p>

<p>Rode TJ Bike to the station and am now on my way to 麻布十番 for my
third session with Rin.</p>

<p>We are going to work on my first workshop together as well.</p>

<p>Then men&rsquo;s circle tonight.</p>

<p>I wanted to swap the commas a bit so I rewrote the commit messages
with <code>git rebase 68a8c08</code>.  Now the top of <code>git log --oneline --graph --decorate
--all</code> looks like this (sans colorization):</p>

<pre><code>* 7dc0917 (HEAD -&gt; master) back
* 10b1b54 some,
* 35be077 well,
* 0bd1c8b several
| * 84efab7 (norigin/master, github/master, bitbucket/master) some
| * 143640e well,
| * a8b25db several,
|/
* 68a8c08 years
* 34b1460 ago
* b62b05e when
* 8f33818 he
* 7ce3602 was
</code></pre>

<p>After writing this, I started composing a message on <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/">english.stackexchange.com</a></p>

<pre><code>I am writing a story in which an US American man is being
interviewed.  The man is relaying a story which happened in the
past.  To describe how long ago it happened, he uses the word
&quot;some&quot; and then wants to revise it to &quot;several (years ago).&quot;

Without punctuation, it would be transcribed as

... that was back some well several years ago when he was still ...

I am debating between adding commas to indicate pauses either as

A. that was back some, well, several years ago when he was still ...

or

B. that was back some well, several, years ago when he was still ...
</code></pre>

<p>but ended up not posting it as there are several answers already.</p>

<p>I got a seat on my preferred train.  I arrived in just enough time,
though it&rsquo;s reasonable to say I could have ridden more slowly to be
safer (down the big-ass whooo-hooo hill).</p>
