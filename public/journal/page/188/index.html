<p>Yesterday I spent a few hours working on AB site; they basically want
a new login type for the frontend, so I need to restructure how the
logins are processed.  Basically I had put the email address in the R
table because only Rs can log in to the frontend, and we need to email
Rs from the backend.  But now Os can also login to the frontend, and I
don&rsquo;t want to check two tables (because it will soon be three or four
or 95) against login credentials.  So I&rsquo;m moving the login credentials
to their own table and will have a linking table tell what personas
this particular logged in person has.</p>

<p>I hope it will work.</p>

<hr />

<p>Another big change is allowing Rs to see items which had been
suggested, but are no longer available.  The original site design said
only things which are &ldquo;available&rdquo; shall be visible.  Oh, unless they
<em>used</em> to be &ldquo;available&rdquo; and were mentioned to the Rs at that time.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this wasn&rsquo;t a very difficult to change to implement.
It&rsquo;s almost done now; I just need to tweak the color which means &ldquo;no
longer available.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taught for two hours in Kamata, subbing for Diana. One of the students
is a 65 year old woman who has a license to practice pharmacy (though
she never used it (she got it to support herself in case she ever got
divorced)), and is attending classes in chemistry now.  inspiring!</p>

<p class="dream">
With SBK and her twin sister, we had a big bed together and I got to
sleep with both at the same time, with the door open, and we heard
some noise during fellatio with SBK twin, so I got up and bumped the
door closed without leaving the bed and came back and SBK began
fellatio and I joked like "hey you're cutting in line; let's kiss," and
twin went back to fellatio and I kissed SBK for a few seconds,
relishing the moment until it changed as Steve came over to put away
his blanket, and I considered gently rushing him out, but I hadn't
seen him in a while so I said he could just put the blanket anywhere
would be fine.  Unfortunately the moment with twins had passed and I
went looking for them, but found only  some people who wanted to have
me proofread an article, and I laughed at the note about the author
having received 892,023? (just under 900,000, I rememeber) text messaged
correctoons or nquiries hahah so that's why they didn't reply
</p>

<p>then my alarm went off.</p>

<p>GG lesson that night featured a discussion of Airplane Day; they were
all shocked to know three towers had fallen that day.  I&rsquo;m curious if
they&rsquo;ll do some research on their own. T told me after class she
couldn&rsquo;t believe it.</p>

<p>I taught two lessons in Shinagawa.  First was a private lesson where I
asked questions about her hobby: birdwatching. She seems pretty
dedicated to birdwatching and was pretty good speaking once she spoke,
but seemed really shy.</p>

<p>Second lesson featured two chatty women, who were relatively low, but
really tried hard.  I know logically this is what I need to do to
improve my Japanese: speak, speak, speak, and speak!</p>
