<p><p>Back-in-the-day, when I first met Maggie and crew in the dorms,
Maggie would often buy me lunch.  I commented on this, and she said
something to the effect of,</p>

<pre>money is just like stuff.  If I happen to have extra stuff, then
I like to be able to share it.</pre>

<p><p>Her actual quote was much more elegant.</p>

<p><p>That quote has impressed me for many years (6 or more)&hellip; Recently
I&rsquo;ve been reading a book called <em>The Art of Loving</em>, which was
written in 1956 or so.  I don&rsquo;t remember the author&rsquo;s name.</p>

<p><p>In it (and I slaughter the quote), I read something like, &ldquo;one is
wealthy if one will of one&rsquo;s self, or give money or possessions.  A
person who hoardes money and possessions is poor, and he who shares
them is rich.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Something like that.  Something also like, even greater than giving
of stuff, one may give one&rsquo;s own human-ness: emotions, talents, care,
attention etc.</p>

<p><p>Hmmm.</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>So I had a crispy $20 bill and bought a single thirty-three cent
stamp with it from the Post Office vending machine, and got 19 dollar
coins back, including 18 golden dollars and one 1999 Susan B Anthony.</p>

<p><p>In the past couple of days, I&rsquo;ve given away 3 or 4 of those
dollars.</p>

<p><p>(I recognize an interesting thing - the 1 dollar coins seem like less
money than the 1 dollar bills.)</p>

<p><p>I believe the book was not suggesting that I just give away all my
money in the form of dollar coins, but I found it interesting to watch
my emotions and feelings when giving them away.  To a slight extent, I
did feel powerful (not like &ldquo;I am all powerful!&rdquo; but) as if I could
share this energy with others.</p>

<p><p>I really think that the sharing of one&rsquo;s self is one of the
greatest things we can do with each other..  That if I share my real
self with others, that is giving in the highest form.</p>

<p><p>I just suddenly realized this journal must count as such a gift.
Thank you for allowing me to share it with you.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Outside in a parking lot, Wende and I were unravelling a long water hose, which needed to connect from the McDonald&rsquo;s in the parking lot to wash her car.</p>

<p><p class=dream>The hose was in a cabin where we stayed while looking for our wedding spot, and we carried it across the parking lot then unrolled it.  The middle of the hose was hooked way up high on a small balcony above the parking lot.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Wende climbed up the hose in the shape of stairs to unhook it.  For a moment I had a view of her in middair standing way up high on a waterhose, .. just her silouhette against lovely blue sky background.</p>

<p><p class=dream>&ldquo;Wende!&rdquo;  I yelled up to her.  &ldquo;Stay there!  I wanna get your picture!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>As I looked around for my camera, I found it and loaded film into it, then realized it was a dream. and woke up.</p>

<p><p>Back a long time ago, like during high school and college and now, but not as often, I would have dreams that included finding money or rare coins.  In my dream I&rsquo;d be ecstatic, but then wake up and be totally &ldquo;DOH!&rdquo; and feel really gypped or tricked almost.</p>

<p><p>So now, whenever I dream about finding stuff, I&rsquo;m much faster to think, &ldquo;wait-a-minute!  is this a dream??&rdquo;  and check my dream state(*)</p>

<p><p>In the case above, I was thinking about having such beautiful photographs of Wende, and felt really blessed and excited to have them.  &ldquo;Wait-a-minute!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>(*) Check my dream state = test to see if I am actually dreaming.  <br>One technique is to try to fly.  If I can fly, I&rsquo;m dreaming.
<br> Another is to read something and then read it again.  If it changes, I&rsquo;m dreaming.
<br>Another technique is to know that if I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m dreaming or not, I&rsquo;m probably dreaming.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ve gotten a lot faster at recognizing when I&rsquo;m dreaming when the question pops into my head, but lately the question hasn&rsquo;t come to my mind.</p>

<p><p><em>Scary Movie</em> wasn&rsquo;t that great.  A couple of scenes were
funny-ish in their ludicricity, but I didn&rsquo;t really laugh as many
times as I squirmed from the dumb parts.</p>

<p><p>I mean it wasn&rsquo;t like horrible, and I&rsquo;m glad I saw it.  But I&rsquo;m
mostly glad I saw it with free passes.</p>

<p><p>After the movie, I drove straight to ultimate.</p>

<p><p>Weirdest thing is that when I took 610 north and exited I-10 east,
there was NO traffic on I-10 east.  This seemed quite odd, but
certainly allowed for super speedy travel on I-10.  I surmised that
travel inbound just wasn&rsquo;t as popular as outbound, but after driving a
mile, while watching my rearview mirror, I still saw zero cars I-10
eastbound.  The freeway has got to be blocked.</p>

<p><p>Played ultimate for a bit, then a couple more people showed up.  &ldquo;I
was in traffic for 45 minutes!  I-10 was shut down for two accidents!&rdquo;
Ah.</p>

<p><p>Play play play and the ground was really dry and hard on my feet.
Before my body was done running, my feet were really sore from
pounding on the ground.  The balls of my feet felt like they were
trying to blister.</p>

<p><p>I simply slowed down running so much, and took a couple more breaks
than I might have otherwise.</p>

<p><p>In all, a lovely night.</p>

<p><p>At work my project-focus got shifted twice.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Actually <em>don&rsquo;t</em> work on project X right now; work on project Y&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;They just called; timeline for project Y is pushed back.  Work on project M&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I zinged through project M today, using emacs to help me search and replace across multiple files.  (I love emacs!!) I got project M finished and ready for testing tomorrow morning.</p>

<p><p>We just hired a new guy at work.  Dennis, who will be our project manager.  I haven&rsquo;t really spoken with him yet, but he seems pretty cool.</p>

<p><p>Now I&rsquo;m going to go see <em><b>Scary Movie</b></em> with Sara!  (Wende doesn&rsquo;t want to see it)</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was in gymnastics class, happy to be
back and bouncy bouncing on the runway trampoline.
There was some sort of competition, or just a time to
show our skills.  My name was called (along with Mark
W from ultimate) and I climbed onto the runway
trampoline.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was able to do a branny (front flip
with half twist), but not able to do bigger stuff
because I kept bottoming-out the trampoline (hitting
the floor below), effectively stopping my bounces.</p>

<p><p class=dream>The coach lifted a corner of the
trampoline to give me more room to bounce, but then
the tramp was all shaky, and I wasn&rsquo;t comfortable with
the lack of balance.</p>

<p><p>I didn&rsquo;t work a whole lot today; I was significantly sidetracked
with watching stock prices and discovering the source of an error in
my investment club accounting.  The stocks didn&rsquo;t move much.  The
error was minor.</p>

<p><p>I recognized the need to purchase the accounting software from NAIC
(National Association of Investment Clubs).. I&rsquo;m sure their software
does everything my spreadsheet calculations do and more!</p>

<p><p>I reviewed two CDs for KTRU; I&rsquo;ve had them out since early April..
And I still have 1 more CD checked out for review!  I&rsquo;ll do it soon.</p>

<p><p>For dinner, Wende came to my work with Taco Bell food and it was so
so yummy!  I had only a sandwich during the day, and some leftover
meatloaf stuff and potatoes and green beans for breakfast.</p>

<p><p>I turned in my two reviewed CDs to KTRU and now I&rsquo;m home!</p>

<p><p class=dream>Setting up our new house which was one story and I had Wende&rsquo;s three witching balls which (no pun intended) are designed to capture evil spirits who get entranced by the spiderweb like strands of glass inside the ball.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was blessing one of the balls for my room and Wende came in and we talked about where to put them</p>

<p><p class=dream>scene melted into assembly of youth watching movie about a man who had 10000 dollars and was tyring to make himself popular.  A confrontation in the movie and then movie over, youth walking from the big movie screening room along an outdoor hallway like a school and one youth lit up a cigarette.</p>

<p><p class=dream>same energy of the movie, but at camp outside.  and the scene transformed into
outside at a campground, with Maia and Tiffany at SWUUSI probably, and
I was in a car maybe Mr Van at the bottom of a ramp and a the man from the movie was at
the top of the ramp in a car as if he were about to drive down and
kill soemeone, but we didn&rsquo;t know who.  The sense was that this was a
soap opera movie, so his plan was clear (kill someone) but we didn&rsquo;t know
who.  I yelled up to him HI! and he asked yelled back a question and I
climbed up the structure to see what he wanted and he asked if i had
ever driven down this big ramp and down the hill and i said i had done
it on skates before.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I confronted him; who are you planning to kill or planning to and he
halfway confessed and I said don&rsquo;t do it and got down and then he
drove to the bottom of the the ramp (not down the entire hill) and he
stabbed my cousin Peter in the upper right shoulder blade.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was all &ldquo;Call 911!!&rdquo;  and I called 991 at first and the operator
said, &ldquo;you dialed it wrong&rdquo; and hung up and then I dialed correctly
and the guy answered &ldquo;fire, police or ambulance?&rdquo; and I was all, &ldquo;um..
police&rdquo; but they took forever to answer the phone.  As I was waiting
for them to answer, two people were tryng to pin the guy down.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I went over (they never answered) and someone was using stakes, like
long tent stakes, they were pinning his jacket to the ground.  Jason
was going to kill him by stabbing trhough the back of his neck, and I
yelled, NO as the guy was now calm.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I had a thick cord cord thing and was going to restrain his head
against the ground like a big horse bit and he was all very compliant,
but kept getting out from under it.  I had this cable thing stabbed
significantly far into the sand, and pulled hard against his mouth and
then was stabbbing it into the sand on the other side, but he kept
getting out somehow.  The entire time I was talking to him, all, &ldquo;sir
you need to lay back down&rdquo; and he would comply, talking about some
other aspect</p>

<p><p class=dream>stabbing the cable arms&rsquo; length  into the  ground I finally was starting to get the guy caught for good and use coat hangars on the other side to make it tighter.  problem solved essentially and I woke up</p>

<p><p>In my men&rsquo;s group tonight, I expressed an inability
to relax, because I think I must <em>do something</em>
in order to be of value for the world.</p>

<p><p>The fouled logic goes:
<br>If I don&rsquo;t do something, then I&rsquo;m not productive
<br>If I&rsquo;m not productive, then I&rsquo;m not helping
society
<br>If I&rsquo;m not helping society, then I might as well
not be here</p>

<p><p>I recognize the value to my soul of relaxation /
meditative time, so I set the intention to relax for 1
hour&hellip; on Thursday.</p>

<p><p>I will call or email Dan to tell him of my success.</p>

<p><p>Today in our investment club we voted to purchase our first three stocks:  10 each of Men&rsquo;s Wearhouse, Ericsson, and The Gap.  A bit of diversity and hopefully some winning securities!</p>

<p><p>I drove home and Wende&rsquo;s truck was there, but there was a note on the door:  &ldquo;Come  <emQuickly</em> to  Hobbit Cafe!  I&rsquo;ll order you a fungus sandwich.&rdquo;   I like mushrooms, so I left immediately for Hobbit Cafe.</p>

<p><p>Wende, my dad, and Elise were there!  Lovely!   They had pretty much just arrived; hadn&rsquo;t even ordered yet.</p>

<p><p>I showed them my new crazy fun keyboard and Elise and dad each took a turn writing me a note on it.  Fun!</p>

<p><p>Now Wende and I are home about to sleep.</p>
