<p>I wanted to write a Bash script which would take a file with a list of
passwords and throw each one at Troy Hunt&rsquo;s collection of compromised
passwords.</p>

<p>I probably won&rsquo;t do it soon because I found a <a href="https://medium.com/@monliclican/bash-one-liner-to-check-your-password-s-via-pwnedpasswords-coms-api-using-the-k-anonymity-method-a5807a9a8056">bash one-liner which
checks to see if a password was compromised</a>.</p>

<p>I had to modify it slightly, but this line works on my Mac:</p>

<pre><code>echo &quot;pass&gt; &quot;; read -s pass_str; sha1=$(echo -n $pass_str | tr -d '\n' | shasum); echo &quot;Hash prefix: ${sha1:0:5}&quot;; echo &quot;Hash suffix: ${sha1:5:35}&quot;; result=$(curl https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/${sha1:0:5} 2&gt;/dev/null | grep $(echo ${sha1:5:35} | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]')); echo &quot;Count: ${result#*:}&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>I have been upgrading AB&rsquo;s PHP to the standards described in
<a href="https://leanpub.com/mlaphp">Paul Jones&rsquo; Modernizing Legacy Applications in PHP</a>.
So far I am still in the Autoloading section, but have done nearly
half of the classes.  Almost all of the &ldquo;data&rdquo; classes are done, but
none of the search or factory classes are done.</p>

<p>(I put data in quotes above because I think that is just a name we
came up with ..  not sure if it has a meaning outside our project.)</p>

<p>But that is not why I am writing.  I was just reading Troy Hunt
talking about passwords and want to add the HIBP password check to the
site.  I am glad we do not really limit the passwords (much; we do
crop them at a few hundred characters, but I now know to not do that),
but I am not sure I can get buy-in to require everyone to have good
passwords.</p>

<p>I am thinking I will log if passwords have been cracked, but that may
be a security issue itself.  Not sure.</p>

<p>Lin and I are headed to her sister&rsquo;s for some family thing.  Dinner
and brownies (with coconut yuck).  I forgot to bring any puzzles for
the kids to play with.</p>

<p>Oh, speaking of puzzles, I gave/loaned to Atsuko the kinda-easy
star-shaped ring puzzle that I bought in Brazil.</p>

<p>Today I met with Tariq and Dipendra to talk about ConSwi.  They are
all excited about the graphics and I am in the camp of getting a
minimum viable product out. I want to empower Dipendra to update the
graphics in the app.  He got a copy of Conswi from Github.  Instead of
giving him write access to the app, I had him create his own account
and push to his own ConSwi.</p>

<p>Although it is a fork, I assume it is not counted as a fork from
Github&rsquo;s point of view.  I wonder if that is possible to make happen.
Probably not if it has not been implemented already.</p>

<p>Dang it is 5:30 and already dark.  I remember our 5pm picture in Sao
Paolo was like noon here.</p>

<p>The lessons I teach on Wednesday morning used to be on Thursday
mornings.  They were one of the first lessons I taught for JB.  Pretty
convenient when Lin and I lived near Kawasaki station, but now it
takes over an hour to go each way for an hour lesson.</p>

<p>Once I win the lottery, this will be one of the first lessons I
release because I have to leave the house by 5:45 to get a seat on the
train on the way there (or leave by 6:15 and stand for 40 minutes
total on (two) trains).</p>

<p>Two years ago, Mayumi gave me
<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=hanayama+marble+images&amp;ia=images">Hanayama Marble</a>.
After playing with it for weeks, I nearly solved it, but in a fit of
frustration gave up and looked up the answer online.  Upon seeing the
solution, I thought &ldquo;ahhhh crap of course!!!&rdquo;  It is such an elegant
solution and I was nearly there.</p>

<p>Four weeks ago, in this class, we started playing a pattern matching
word game.  For fun, I started with the same word one of the students
had started with.</p>

<ul>
<li>Haneda Airport</li>
<li>LA International Airport</li>
<li>Mt Fuji</li>
<li>Kobe Airport</li>
</ul>

<p>I thought they would be able to solve it quickly, but this went on for
four weeks until I finally had to pull the plug because one of the
students expression was like <em>fuck this</em>.  I ended up giving them the
answer and the same student was like &ldquo;ahhhh crap of course!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So in honor of that, today I brought my Hanayama Marble puzzle and
left it with one of the students to play with.</p>

<p>Still going through MLAPHP for the AB project.  I guess I am about
halfway through the step of naming all the class definition files so
they can be loaded via the autoloader.</p>

<p>During this process I found <a href="https://www.mabl.com/">Mabl</a> which
features a short domain name and some tools for automated testing.
Pretty easy onboarding, and they are giving the site a good onceover
every day.</p>

<p>Eventually need to create a staging system with fake data so they can
give the backend a daily look as well.</p>
