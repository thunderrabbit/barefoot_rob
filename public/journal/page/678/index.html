SWUUSI 1997 by Rob<br />
</p>
<p>
26 July 1997
<p>
Drove up here after Bobby, Erika, and Nathan drove to Houston and spent the night at our apartment.  Altogether we had Me, Jason Fricke, Mike Noyse, Bobby Hall, Erika Hewitt, and Nathan Ryan.
<p>Stopped a couple times along the way and Nathan needed a white t-shirt, so we stopped in at Albertson&rsquo;s in Denton.  Found a package that was open, so we got two shirts for two bucks. Cool.
<p>Drove drove drove and then over a hill and wow- beautiful Lake Texoma longer wide than we could see. It has been 10 years since I crossed this bridge to get to SWUUSI back in my halcyon days of YRUUdom. 10 years! And the memories flooded back.  I have to totally
go see where we used to hang out..  The Point,  where Karina and I made a pile of rocks using only our feet until it was tall enough to reach out of the shallow water. Bayview Lodge, where we piled everyone into 2 beds, made potato print t-shirts, ..  everything.
<p>But not this year.  This year our biological nature station thing is nestled beautifully in the trees overlooking the lake. Breathtaking!!!  We need to get a poet up here!
<p>We fell out of the cars like puppies, excited to greet our new home for a week.  We hugged Andy Andrews, Amanda Hovland, Daniel Polk.   Wow wow wow!!!!   First thing we went for a walk down the asphalt drive down to the boat docks.  First thing I
noticed on the way down is that the asphalt was HOT.  Hot hot hot hot hot.  Amanda pointed out that I wasn&rsquo;t wearing shoes.   Hmmmm.
<p>I went out the rocky peninsula as the rest of em went into the covered boat dock area.  We tossed the frisbee back and forth between me and them, taunting the wind to blow the frisbee into the water.  Close- but we were able to get it out with a stick.
<p>
And then up to the rooms!!  Amazing with couches and desks and bunk beds and air conditioning and separate fridge and a door to the patio out back!!
<hr><p>
We just had the SWUUSI planning meeting.  Wonderful to watch the youth deliberate and determine the rules that were appropriate, allowing freedom for fun, safety from danger and stuff.
<p>
I grabbed my pizza colored dogbone pillow as I lay on the floor looking at many pictures taken by Arlene Dormio from the New Orleans Rally.  Lots of fun memories from there.
<p>Now it&rsquo;s dinnertime.</p><p>
After a wonderful dinner (where I had to wear shoes) we decided to swim.  I got my trunks on, and went running with frisbee toward the lake.  I threw it into the wind and caught it a couple of times and then I realized I had lost my toe ring!  Doh!!<br>
So I walked carefully searching the ground for where I had been running and did not find it.  Jason, Andy and Dane helped.  After not too long, Dane found it.  Yay Dane!!  It had split at the seam; I&rsquo;ll have to get it re-soldered when we get back.
<p>Walked toward the beach and   <b><b>OW!!</b></b> big cockleburs had stabbed deeply into my foot.  Dang dang dangit!! Dane helped me pull them out, and then carried me on his back to the lake.  Then, much to my (almost) surprise, ran straight into the water without regard to his jeans or shirt or wallet (or my
shirt)..    The water is orgasmically fabulously, astonishingly wonderfully warm.   Awww  yeah warmer than a bath!  Well, as warm as a bath.  Incredible.<br />
<p>In our warm wonderful bath, we splashed around, played mar<br>c</br>o polo, had chicken fights, had non-chicken fights, waved to a jet skiier, and just had a great time.  The best silly fun for me was when we found some tires half buried in the bottom of the lake and Jason and I played King of the Tire.  That was
cool.  Bryan Beck and Dane Dormio joined after we played for a while and we goofed around, pushing each other off the tires, while trying to stay balanced.<br />
<p>The sun went down, and we decided to get out.  I left my shirt spread out over the rocky shore, hoping it will be dry when I get it tomorrow.<br />
<p>Mike Noyse walked up to me and was all, &ldquo;check this out.   Here hold this in your left hand near your chest.&rdquo;  He handed me an orange.  &ldquo;Okay hold out your right arm.&rdquo;   I did this and he pushed down on my right arm.  It didn&rsquo;t go down very far.    &ldquo;Okay, now hold this in your left hand near your chest.&rdquo;  He handed me a cigarette.  Ewww!  Then he pushed down on my right arm and it went way far down. Well that&rsquo;s just cause I was grossed out by the cigarette.  Or was it?
<p>I went outside to find the other advisors and show them this new experiment.  They were already doing it. We attempted to make it more scientific by making the item holder close his or her eyes and having them hold items of equal feel but different healthy-factors. Nothing was proven, but it&rsquo;s certainly an interesting concept.
<p>We are practically out in the middle of nowhere.   This is incredible.
<p>It&rsquo;s now 2:00am Sunday..<br />
<p>We had our YAC meeting, our first one as the &ldquo;new&rdquo; YAC.   We planned to plan our budget, planned some of our plans for the year, and it was generally a productive meeting.<br />
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to Wednesday morning, when I&rsquo;ll present the bead workshop. That will rule. And then Thursday morning when we discuss the most important thing in the world.<br />
<p>So- right now we&rsquo;re planning our budget.  And just now I had some fun 2am humor:
<p>Arlene:  &ldquo;Where should we have our YAC retreat?&rdquo;<br>Rob: &ldquo;What would really be cool is we could go camping  set up the tent, be cookin&rsquo; some beans over the fire..&rdquo;<br> Arlene:&ldquo;I think we would spend more time camping than meeting- just trying to survive.&rdquo;<br>Rob:&ldquo;&lsquo;Ohmygod there&rsquo;s a bear!  I move that we adjourn the meeting!&rsquo;   &lsquo; I second!!&rsquo;  &lsquo;All in favor??&rsquo;   Aaaiiiiieeeeee!!!!</p>
<p>After we were done budget planning, Bryan Beck, Melissa Cain and I walked outside just to see what we could see.  The sky was not as spectacularly starry as we had expected, but it was still beautiful.  As our eyes got more adjusted to the dark, we could see the arm of the Milky Way stretching over us.   Awesome.  Awesome enough that I ran and got my sleeping bag and we spent a couple hours talking and stargazing.  Before it began to get light, I was falling asleep and they kept on talkin&rsquo;.   As it began to get light, I was fully asleep and they decided to continue their conversation elsewhere.  I woke up this morning at like 7am.
<p>Slept from 7:20 till breakfast, ate breakfast and then we were on the scramble to get the YAC response to a letter sent to the district board about the YAC.  Bryan typed the thing on my computer, then I realized I didn&rsquo;t have a floppy drive on my machine.  So he retyped it on Arlene&rsquo;s computer and we copied it to disk, drove to the main camp, but had no printer with which to print it.  We helped Connie Nolen set up her computer, but she didn&rsquo;t have software that could read the format.  We finally found Ann Jacobson&rsquo;s computer and set it up and YAY!! And we printed it and found an extra copy of the bylaws and got everything signed and copied and at exactly 3pm and had to borrow the stapler from the front desk and Tia and Jeremy zipped up to Room 229 and wow.  Done.  At least my end was done.<br />
<p>Bryan Beck, Kristian Captain Shallin Kazoo Kris Scott, and I drove back to the Biological Research Center and here we are! Youth are arriving and the energy level is spiraling up and up.
<p> John Thompson from Fatetteville and I decided to go swimming.  We asked if anyone else wanted to go, and soon ended up with a group of about 10 people to go swim. Swimming were (I don&rsquo;t know last names yet) Abe from California, Emily, Lindsey, Nicole Catrette, Mike Moren, Rob Nugen (me), Scott, John, Maggie, and one other dude whose name I have forgotten.
<p>When I got to the beach, I was thrilled to see rocks carefully placed on my shirt, which I had left to dry the previous night.  They  spelled, &ldquo;HI Rob&rdquo; and then had a smiley face at the bottom.  The people here are so wonderful!!
<p>Everyone slowly made it into the water and we mostly kinda floated around until we did a couple chicken fights, then tried a couple of rounds of the knot game.  The freakiest thing was that minnows started to nibble nibble nibble our backs and it was tickly to me but unbearable to some.  Pretty funny, I thought.
<p>Then we played marco polo. We played until several  people got bored and got out and then everyone else got out until it was just me standing in ankle deep water leading Mike &ldquo;Marco Forever&rdquo; Moren out of the lake.
<p>I chilled on the beach for a second to relax and then went to pick up my shirt.   I didn&rsquo;t think to take a picture of the &ldquo;HI Rob,&rdquo; but I will always remember it in my heart.   Thank you.
<p>Dinner was dynamic now with 70 crazy bodies instead of only 10.   And then the first timers meeting full of jokes about &ldquo;Debe&rsquo;s gonna take you down!&rdquo; and  &ldquo;Debe couldn&rsquo;t take an elevator down!!&rdquo;
<p>Then Opening circle, which went quite well, outside on the basketball court by the pavilion.
<p>Then touch groups.  I&rsquo;m in Aaron Ivener&rsquo;s group, along with Keith Lawlor, who recently went to the Pavement concert, Riley from Arkansas, whose town is smaller in population than this conference, Frank Roesler from OKC, who I don&rsquo;t remember what, and Eric Morrow, also from OKC, who just got a car and drove to SWUUSI this year (and got lost).
<p>After touch groups, Dane and Bryan were walkin&rsquo; down the hall with clippers, planning to cut Bryan&rsquo;s hair.
<p>Hmmmm.   I buzzed my hair using the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo; guard on Friday before SWUUSI.  I buzzed my hair using no guard tonight.  It is short.  Feels like velvet.  I love it.
<p>Now it&rsquo;s 10:30pm and I&rsquo;ll be an Awake, Aware Alert Advisor until 5am.
<p>Wow- so my hair has been growing for 6.5 hours now..  The coolest things I did were laying out in the field with several youths, watching the stars, and the other was listening to Kris, Aaron, Daniel, and Susanne all play guitar.  What a fabulous source of love and positive joyful energy!!!
<p>I just now walked in from outside and nine inch nails &ldquo;burn&rdquo; was on the CD player.  I cranked it up and let the music grind into my skull for the last 5 minutes of my AAAA duty.
<p>Peace out, G.  It&rsquo;s 5am Monday.   I&rsquo;m going to sleep or going to shave my head all the way.  Don&rsquo;t know which.
<p>2:40pm Monday.  I shaved my head all the way.  Bald.  I did it myself with Bobby&rsquo;s disposable razor.  It&rsquo;s quite an interesting experience.   It doesn&rsquo;t look all that different, but it sure feels different.  I totally loved it, though I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;d be comfortable like this all the time.    I got a couple pictures taken of me last night then I slept for a few hours and then had breakfast.
<p>During breakfast, a memorandum was passed out to the various tables.  Full of grammatical errors, it reminded us that foul language is not appropriate, &ldquo;specifically the m.f. word overheard last night&rdquo;<br />
<p>Hilarious in some ways, the letter made it into the Big White Rally Book.  However, we want greatly to respect the facilities and their rules, so we&rsquo;ll watch our language..
<p>Then was Jenny Weils&rsquo; time to speak as our theme speaker on spirituality and some other stuff.  It was wonderful. We did a couple of exercises, including a check in, where you tell your name and then give yourself a more immediately appropriate name.  Another exercise we did was get into pairs of people and one person says, &ldquo;I <blah blah blah>&rdquo; and the other person after each sentence says simply, &ldquo;thank you.&rdquo;  This exercise went for about 3 minutes.  It&rsquo;s really hard to tell someone about only yourself for that long!
<p>I mentioned something about how people like to talk &ldquo;about themselves&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s not really about themselves, as this exercise required.<br />
<p>Jenny said, &ldquo;yes- people like to talk about things that are right beside themselves.&rdquo;
<p>Then we kinda talked about what we&rsquo;ll discuss for the rest of the week.<br />
<p>After the spirituality workshop, we molded Fimo, various colors of claylike stuff that you can bake so it retains its shape.  I made a flaming chalice shape with peace symbol colors.<br />
<p>We played with the Ballzak at the swimming beach thing a couple of times.  That&rsquo;s pretty fun.  Mostly we tried to just volley it and keep it from hitting the water.  Erika and I found that it will skip across the water quite nicely if you bounce it with just the right amount of backwards spin.<br />
<p>After dinner, I was walkin&rsquo; around taking pictures.  The funniest ones were of Tiffany, Suzanne, Sarah, and Maggie catching soap bubbles on their tongues.  Then they played a game of improv tag, which I joined for a bit until it was time for the special event.  At one point, one of them was on the ground, so I froze it and took her place.  I re-did a scene from Houston Rally 1986, which Shawn McDaniel did with me.  I said, &ldquo;mom, I want to get a job as a speed bump.&rdquo;  She wouldn&rsquo;t let me, so I complained, &ldquo;you never let me do what I want!  You always said I should get a job doing something I love, and I love to lie down!&rdquo;
<p>She proceeded to show me what it would be like and tried to drive over me.  I was laying there yelling, when the scene got frozen again.  Sarah took her place and now suddenly I was birthing a baby!  I kept yelling and she reminded me to breathe so I did my Lamaz breathing and couldn&rsquo;t take the pain, so I (gently) grabbed her hair and yelled, &ldquo;I want morphine!!&rdquo;  She gave me an injection to the skull and I began to float around, gently cooing and singing..   We were frozen, and someone took my place and turned it into a ballet.  Soon, one of them missed a cue and fell to the ground or something, so I became the director, yelling, &ldquo;cut!  Cut!  It&rsquo;s time for the special event!!&rdquo;
<p>The special event was Casino Night!  This time with pixie sticks as currency, there was the roulette wheel used at Houston Rally 1997, two craps tables and two poker tables.   I quickly lost all my money at roulette and craps, and I even laundered some empty pixie sticks.<br />
<p>I took several pictures, and then was asked to run a craps table.  I was a bit overwhelmed by all the bets that were being placed, &ldquo;$100 on odd!&rdquo;  &ldquo;200 on even!&rdquo;  &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll roll an eight!&rdquo;  &ldquo;Odd!&rdquo; so I just started calling, &ldquo;if you lose, slide &lsquo;em in, hold &lsquo;em up if you win!&rdquo;  That seemed to work just fine.
<p>My bank had great fluctuations in value, but ended up with lots of cash.  The betting was ended and the auction began! I embezzled the bank I had been working, and waited until Jason held up the gumball machine.  &ldquo;$1000!&rdquo; &ldquo;$1500!&rdquo;   &ldquo;$3000!&rdquo;  &ldquo;$5000!!&rdquo;  Then I called, &ldquo;Sixty Nine Thousand Dollars!!!&rdquo; Jason hollered something like, &ldquo;Rob!!  You stole that!&rdquo;  So I ran up toward the booth and then out the door, just being silly.  I walked back in after a second and turned in my loot. The rest of the auctioning was full of excitement and fun.  I enjoyed watching everyone have a great time. At the end, all the pixie sticks were thrown into the crowd.  Yay!!!
<p>My hair feels like 80 grit sandpaper.
<hr>
<p>Now I am at home.  Today is Sunday, a couple of days after SWUUSI, and all I have are a few sparse notes and wonderful memories.
<p>I attended the Worship Workshop, where we designed the worship for Wednesday night, I believe.  Most of the ideas we used were given by Tiffany Schneider.  I gave essentially zero ideas, but just pointed out a couple of possible problems that they may encounter.
<p>Outside, I took my frisbee and began to toss it way into the air and catch it myself.  Soon a few youth joined me and we played catch for a while.  I got to give a few pointers on how to throw.  At some point, I got to make several throws to John Thompson and Chris Cusak.  These were fun throws because John and Chris wanted me to throw as far and as hard as possible so they could practice running, catching and everything. They did quite well.
<p>The Young Adults came that afternoon while several of us were in a great game of Ultimate (frisbee).  It&rsquo;s one of my favorite games in the whole world!  Paul, who had just arrived with the young adults, joined us.<br />
<p>Everyone played hard and had a great time.  At the end, we were all <em>totally</em> sweaty and tired. Unfortunately, there were 3 injuries during the game.  Frank Roesler re-injured a bruised bone in his foot (I think), I twisted my right ankle, and Scott Burrington twisted his left ankle.
<p>Despite my ankle, I went swimming, wanting the warm buoyancy to keep me off my foot.
<p>We swam until it began to get dark, pushing the limits of, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not dark yet!&rdquo; until it really was pretty dark and I realized one of the balls was floating    I swam after it and finally caught it.  By the time I got back toward shore, it was totally dark.  But I had recovered the ball.  Yay!
<p>The worship that night ruled.  This is the one that I watched in the planning stages.   The worship the previous night  hadn&rsquo;t been as great as it coulda been since people kept talking.  So we set the mood of this worship from the very beginning.  Everyone lined up in the hallway and were led toward the library in which all the lights were off except for a few candles.  As each individual entered, they were greeted with a hug and a piece of gum was placed into their mouth.   Everyone sat quietly in a circle until everyone else had entered and been seated.  The candles around the perimeter of the room were extinguished, and a chalice was lit in the center of the circle.  Tiffany read a wonderful poem she had written, describing matches and candles,  and then the next portion of the ceremony was presented.
<p>Each person approached the chalice and lit a small candle for someone (who may or may not be at SWUUSI),  and placed the candle in the sand around the chalice.  Then put their gum on a small plate beside the sand.  (Actually the plate was a lid to a peanut butter jar)    This process took way longer than expected.  However, everyone was silent during the entire ceremony.  Silent! (oops i mean silent)
It was incredible.  After everyone had lit their candle and placed their gum (except for myself who forgot to place my gum and swallowed it instead) a last candle was lit and stuck into the pile of gum, representing the entire community working together.
<p>Emotions were incredibly high.  As the worship ended, tears and hugs were everywhere.  About 15 people stayed and we endlessly sang &ldquo;we are a circle within a circle, with no beginning and never ending,&rdquo; arm in arm around the chalice, watching the candles burn.  A few people were there until every candle had burned completely out.   I understand the experience was unlike any other.
<p>That night I slept with ice on my ankle for several hours on a couch in the front room.
<p>The next morning, Jenny Weils 1.5 year old son joined us during the spirituality workshop.  If I remember correctly, Maggie, Sarah, Jordan and Amber took care of him during this time.  The workshop this day included a discussion on prayer.  What is prayer?  How is it different than meditation?  To who/what are we actually praying?  Does it matter who/what?  Does prayer actually work?<br />
<p>At noon that day I led the bead workshop.  We had about a million beads and about 10 youth and plenty of creativity.  I showed them how to make a simple daisy and then gave it to the first one who held out their hand (I think Jordan).  All variety of bead necklaces, bracelets, rings, etc were created mostly in silence.  It turned out to be a pretty good type of meditation for most.
<p>Soon, I had to leave with 4 youth members of YAC for a meeting with district boards members at the main lodge.  The meeting started as a get-to-know-ya meeting, but quickly turned into a let&rsquo;s-all-meet-and-rewrite-the-yruu-bylaws meeting.   The logic behind this is to keep the YAC from being turned down year after year by the SWUUC board.  If bylaws are designed by everyone who must approve them, then the approval should be much easier.  This seemed to be a good idea to most, and I was happy with it because the entire YAC is invited to this Summit.  The YAC Summit will be held in Austin 10-12 October 1997.  If you would like us to present any ideas, let YAC know by 12 September 1997.
<p>That night was the Lammas ceremony.  The coolest thing-as we were driving up to the site, I saw my mom walkin&rsquo; toward it!  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my mom!  Let me out!&rdquo;  So I hopped out of the car and walked with her to the site.  We briefly exchanged stories and ideas until the ceremony began.  I highly enjoyed talking to her as an  what an interesting experience!
<p>Karen Rinehart-Morgan, now in the young adults group joined us in the circle.  She and I hung out and sang out throughout the entire ceremony.  The circle was cast, and the entire group requested the power of the four directions/elements in turn.  We were nourished with bread and then performed the round and round wiggly crazy spiral dance hand in hand while endlessly chanting/singing &ldquo;we all come from the Goddess, and to her we shall return like a drop of rain, flowing to the ocean&rdquo; and &ldquo;hoof and horn hoof and horn, all that dies shall be reborn, corn and grain corn and grain, all that falls shall rise again.&rdquo;   Then we thanked all four directions/elements and the circle was opened but not broken and everyone laughed and hugged and talked and it was beautiful.
<p>A small fiasco was required to get all the youth into the vans/cars so we could go to our customary pancake place for wild and crazy pancake night!
<p>We entirely filled the pancake place.   Shortly after we arrived, I noted that some of my old rally buds were there!   I had just seen Shawn McDaniel at Ft Worth, so he wasn&rsquo;t too hard to recognize.  I remembered Joe Kast&rsquo;s name, but I couldn&rsquo;t think of Gail Keen&rsquo;s.   But isn&rsquo;t that amazing???   10 years ago we used to play!!!
<p>The waitstaff handled us fabulously well;  youth were almost bouncing off the walls after such an energy boost as Lammas.  I was equally nutty, and I mostly remember myself, Bryan Beck, Austin Roth, and maybe someone else going crazy  beat boxing out in the parking lot.  Bryan said that last year they got in trouble for being so loud.  We didn&rsquo;t  have that problem this year.
<p>I stayed up all night , high on sugar and love and happiness.   Soon after we got back, I put on  Beastie Boys on the CD player in the main living room area.  Several youth were alert but crashed on the couches, while some others were buzzing alert playing cards.  I danced my brains out to Beastie Boys and then put on much slower gentler Tori Amos and lay down to listen to her.
<p>Once I had recovered, I played the &ldquo;Set&rdquo; game, owned by Melissa Cain.  It&rsquo;s a pretty interesting/almost complex pattern matching game played with cards.  Once I figured out how to play (although not as well as the youth), I joined Charlotte Benbenek-Price, Marie Shallin, and Marsha Murphy (I think) in a long game of Egyptian Rat Screw.  We were silly!!   Actually, it was mostly Marie who was quite the silliest.  Charlotte and I shook our heads in amazement, while Marsha, being at her first YRUU anything, just kinda let it slide.
<p>During this game, I kept on saying &ldquo;Whassup Dog?&rdquo; or &ldquo;go, dog!&rdquo; or whatever, using the pronoun &ldquo;dog.&rdquo;  Charolette would reply, &ldquo;Cat?&rdquo; and then we&rsquo;d both say,  &ldquo;Swordfish?  Trilobite!!!&rdquo; with all the intensity that 5am humor can bring.  I can&rsquo;t begin to tell you how funny that was at 5am.
<p>At about 6 or 7am I went to bed for about 1.5 hours.
<p>This day, Thursday, after the final spirituality workshop with Jenny Weil, I went into the main room looking for anyone who wanted to participate in the discussion on The Most Important Thing in the World.
Dane Dormio, Tiffany Bush, and I think Laura Andrews and then Erika Hewitt, another advisor joined us.
More precisely, this was a discussion on &ldquo;What is the most important thing for humans to do in the world?&rdquo;
We wondered at first if there could in fact be a most important thing to do in the world.
Assuming there was, we determined it is something like being nice to people and having fun in life.
What I remember most is that Dane and I have almost exactly the same view of the universe, briefly, that each person is an aspect of God, learning about God&rsquo;s self.  As Dane was describing his view, I was amazed at how well it matched mine.<br />
The next most memorable thing was how astonished Erika became as I told her my version of Joe McMoneagle&rsquo;s near death experience.  Then after reading a portion of his book, Mind Trek,she was really amazed!  If you&rsquo;re interested, read the whole book; it&rsquo;s quite good.
<p>That night was the wild wacky wild crazy nutty zany talent show!  It started out tamely enough, with Adam Lock telling a really bad martian joke, and then me not telling the joke that begins, &ldquo;One day there was this . And he really loved clowns.&rdquo;   Instead, ck_scott and Aaron Ivener played some guitar song and then Dorthea Micklea danced with them to a cover of &ldquo;Groove is in the Heart&rdquo; by Deee Light.
Then something else and then the great Spam eating performance, and another something else and about the time that Frank Roesler did an improv version of  some song, and Bryan Beck and I performed our cover of  &ldquo;Havin&rsquo; a Roni&rdquo; by Vanilla Ice, the Groovy Juice kicked in and the whole place got crazy.
Next thing I remember is Willy Wagner, Daniel Kaminsky and Nathan Sexton performing as the 3 Headed Wonder, and then I think that&rsquo;s when Jason Fricke and Austin Roth(?) carried Bryan Beck, giggling uncontrollably, and dumped him on the stage.  Then Jason Fricke, Jeremy Loomis-Norris(?) and I each drank a third of a 2 liter of Surge and it was great.
Just as everyone thought the show was over, we advisors called them all back for the last performance, our version of &ldquo;Yogi Bear&rdquo;   Instead of each verse describing Yogi or one of his friends, each verse described one of the advisors!  Mine went something like, &ldquo;Rob thinks he&rsquo;s an adult, . Yeah, right&rdquo;
We had great fun.
<p>Then the YAC had a meeting, which proved somewhat difficult for our concentration, so we discussed a few issues and decided to move the rest to our next meeting.
<p>Then the last and most beautiful worship.  We started with an Angel Wash, where each person walks between two rows of people who use their hands and brush over the aura of the person walking through the line.  Then we sat in a circle and offered thoughts about the week.   I cried, listening to the incredible level of emotional sharing between the youth.  I was not alone; I could hear many sniffles throughout the room.  It was beautiful.
<p>Afterwards, many people stayed and hugged forever.  After probably 20 minutes of hugs all around, the several remaining people agreed that now would be a great time for a dance!
<p>Beastie Boys, that crazy Seasamee Street song (twice!) and tons of stuff until we were just soaked with sweat.  Then it was declared to be a great time to watch the videos John Thompson had candidly recorded during the week.  Most hilarious was stuff from the talent show.
<p>The movies began to get kinda long and not quite so entertaining, so I went to sleep.   It was probably 4:30 in the am.  I slept until about 7:30, ignoring the insanity that began at 6:30, starring Debe running through the hallways, banging a pot or something, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s time to get up!!  Wake up and get your stuff packed!  We gotta have this place clean in 2 hours!!&rdquo;
<p>I meditated as I packed, remembering all the greatness of the week, making certain I packed everything I had brought.  I woulda forgotten my copy of Mind Trek, but it ended up on the lost and found ping-pong table.  I had given up on finding my SWUUSI shirt, but I got it back because when I first got it, I had immediately written my name on the tag.
<p>Many many many hugs were given all over the place.  We had a surprise for Julie Sexton when she came to pick up her son Nathan.  Everyone crowded between her and him, and we told her we had a surprise.  She told us to &ldquo;part like the Red Sea&rdquo; which is pretty ironic because, surprise!  Nathan not only had magenta hair, his whole torso was practically red.  This was a result of the tie dye workshop, through which I had slept.
<p>While we were waiting for parental units to arrive, someone called me over.  &ldquo;Hey, Rob-  who is your step sister?&rdquo;   I hugged Alicia Montgomery, much to their surprise.  It&rsquo;s true!!  The craziest part is that my dear rally friend Karina Montgomery (Alicia&rsquo;s half sister) and I knew each other way before our respective parents met and got married.<br />
<p>I waited until Alicia was picked up by her dad, and then Jason Fricke and I cruised.
<p>On the way home, Jason and I worked on YAC stuff.  We essentially proved that youth from the various churches must design the rallies, and Jason sketched out a structure of responsibility from YRUU up through YAC to the district board.  I think the idea will work wonderfully; it&rsquo;s quite ingenious.
<p>Also on the way home, we each ate about 30 pixie sticks.  Maybe more.  And when we stopped at Dairy Queen, I ate a medium M&amp;M Blizzard.  Lots of people were staring at us- buzz haircut, belt with studs, and white tank top.
<p>We both stayed awake the rest of the way home.  I had Jason teach me some lyrics to his favorite songs, and he taught me the difference between punk, ska and oi, his favorite musical genres.</p>

<p><p>What an incredible trip.</p>

<p><p>Until San Antonio,</p>

<p><p>With Love
<br>- Rob</p>

<p>
SWUUSI hasn't even started, but I've already had a lot of fun.  After 
a relatively short trip, I got here at about 4:00 pm.  I came early 
because my mom's on staff.  There was a staff meeting going on when 
we arrived, but I passed the time talking with Nathan Ryan, who was 
in the same predicament as me.  In what seemed like no time at all 
the meeting was over, and the few of us who were here already went 
walking after a short lunch of roast beef, mashed potatoes and gravy, 
peas and corn.  (otherwise known as "the first clash with the lunch 
ladies")  Rob and Jason threw a frisbee back and forth across a small 
part of the lake that juts in, and of course it ended up in the 
water, so Rob swam in to get it.  Later Rob lost his toe ring while 
running across some grass, and I saw him and Jason walking around 
looking for it.  I went to help, and following my instincts I found 
it in about two minutes.  Coincidence?  Then I piggy-backed 
bare-footed Rob across the burr-filled grass to save his feet, and 
dumped him and myself into beautiful lake Texoma.  I probably should 
have remembered to take my wallet and everything else out of my 
pockets before I jumped in fully clothed and shod.
</p>
<p>
The water was body temperature, perfect for an evening swim.  The 
lake is great, only two stone's-throws from the main building, but it 
seems longer if you happen to be carrying Jason Fricke on your back.  
And the main building is nice, too, although the game room has an 
annoying smell.  The grounds are nice, large and sprawling, or they 
seem that way to me, although I'm sure they will be cut down when the 
boundaries are enforced tomorrow.  We're in a nice, secluded spot, 
with lots of trees where I can hang my hammock.
</p>
<p>
Several of us  stayed in the water for a couple of hours, playing 
Marco Polo and Chicken and King of the Tire (a frustrating game), and 
waving and yelling at passing pontoons.  We all went in before it got 
dark and I have just been hanging out since then.  There's a YAC 
meeting going on right now, tying up most of the people, and I am in 
the oddly-scented room writing this.  Nancy Mauldin, Julie Sexton, 
Debe Barnes, and Emily Sessions are discussing plans and food, with 
occasional helpful comments from Nathan Ryan.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of food, I think we'll have to be careful in the cafeteria 
as best we can, because the cafeteria ladies were a little, um, 
disturbed today at lunch.  One of them asked one of the advisors if 
we were "troubled teens".  Isn't that a bit redundant?  Yes, of 
course.

4:54 pm<br>

</p>
<p>
I just got done attending Debe's mud workshop, but I have no idea 
what went on because the air conditioner was so loud that I couldn't 
hear.
</p>
<p>
Last night kicked a lot of ass, but I should start writing where I 
left off last time.  Most of Saturday night and Sunday morning was 
spent in preparation, doing business stuff.  I waited around 
impatiently most of the time while everybody else worked, since I'm 
not on staff.  The first person to show up was Joanna Hessel, forty 
minutes early, and they flowed in pretty steadily after that, until 
everybody was here a couple of hours later.  The last one to arrive 
was Santiago Webber.  He got here earlier today.  This is pretty 
small for a group camp.  There are a total of around seventy people, 
I think seventy-three to be exact, including the advisors and Bryan 
and Tia, the co-deans.
</p>
<p>
The mood last night was joyous, and the activity  didn't stop all 
night.  The main event started when Bryan wanted to shave his head, 
and when we started to do that about six other people decided to do 
the same thing, so it turned into a grand fiasco.  Rob's hair had 
been freshly cut down to 1/8th of an inch, but I cut it even shorter 
with my clippers.  When everyone was finished we were left with some 
thermally-enhanced clippers and a mess of hair on the floor which had 
to be swept up.  We finished with Maia Cudhea being bald (she was the 
first one earlier that evening), and also Rob, Bryan Beck, Keith 
Lawlor, and Frank Roestler had a mowhawk, Adam Lock and Alex 
Riefenstahl had new undercuts, and Tia Lawlor had the back of her 
hair shaved underneath.
</p>
<p>
After that things calmed down a bit and rolled on steadily until 
morning.  Writing this, I have a feeling like I'm leaving out 
something important but I can't think of what it is.
</p>
<p>
This morning when I was going to breakfast I noticed that Rob's head 
looked a little funny, so I felt it and realized that he had shaved 
it all the way down to the skin with Bobby's razor.
</p>
<p>
Um, that's all the important stuff I can think of, and I'm tired of 
writing now.  Signing off.
</p>
<p>
In a good mood,<br>

Wednesday<br>

2:42 am<br>
</p>
<p>
The fimo workshop was yesterday, as well as the mud workshop.  The 
special event was casino night, with pixi stik wannabes used for 
money.  I'm sure it was a lot of fun, but I didn't go.  Worship was 
in the library after it, but I didn't go to that either.  I started 
to, but for some reason I just wasn't up to it.  I was in that 
restless mindset where nothing I do feels comfortable.  I feel that 
way a bit now.  All the emotional energy from worship 
tonight built up and then dropped.  I don't think I'll skip worship 
anymore, though.  Tonight's service reminded me how good they can be.
</p>
<p>
The body painting workshop was this morning, and worship planning 
and lamas and candle decorating were later.  I didn't go to any 
workshops today, mostly I just hung out in a lazy fashion.  The 
special event this evening was the visitation by the young adults.  
That was really cool.  I almost went to sleep before worship, but as 
soon as I got into the library I woke up.  For the ceremony, everyone 
was silent while we went around in a circle, each person walking to 
the middle and lighting one of many small candles from the big flame 
in the middle, and discarding the gum we had been given on the way in 
on a saucer representing the community.  Then afterwards we got 
emotional and did lots of hugging and took a picture of all the 
candles melted in the sand.  It turned out that there were exactly 
the right amount of candles for everybody.
</p>
<p>
After worship I tried to do some meditation guided by our chaplain 
Peggy Cheney, but things went wrong and it didn't work.  Maybe next 
time.
</p>
<p>
I know people complain about the whole cafeteria situation, i.e. 
wearing shoes and a shirt, and no swearing, , but for all the good it 
will do here are my thoughts on the subject.  The cafeteria rules are 
a blessing in disguise.  If everything went smoothly then group camp 
would be a lot less exciting.  Variety is the spice of life and our 
problems are a subtle form of variety.  The situation we've been put 
in has sparked a lot of useful creativity.  It's not very hard on us 
at all, but instead is challenging and very entertaining.  I have 
enjoyed all the jokes and pranks that have been a result of the lunch 
ladie's stinginess.  So give them a bow.  They deserve it for making 
group camp more entertaining and memorable.
</p>
<p>
In a lighter mood now,<br>

Friday<br>
8-1-97<br>
3:00 am<br>
</p>
<p>
I skipped writing for two whole days this time, so I have some 
catching up to do.  Workshops yesterday were beads and dream 
catchers, and later, in the afternoon, Andy took Debe, Erika, John 
Thompson, Nathan Ryan, Sean Murray, Ben Muller, and me on a geology 
workshop.  We went to the old group camp and learned about fossils.  
Going back to the sight of my first SWUUSI was so wonderful, it 
brought back lots of happy memories of that week two years ago.  I 
saved some big pieces of driftwood for some of my friends who 
had also been there.
</p>
<p>
After that, at 8:30, we took everybody to the lodge in a couple of 
vans for the lamas circle.  Everybody was smudged as he or she 
arrived, and when the circles were formed and the bread was eaten and 
the dance was danced and the friendly, familiar chants were done, I 
felt uplifted, but I didn't get into it as much as last year.  It all 
wasn't as spectacular as the first time.
</p>
<p>
Then we zipped off to the Waffle Shoppe for a midnight snack.  
Surprisingly, they didn't remember us from last year.  I didn't order 
anything, because I wasn't hungry and I wanted to save my money.
</p>
<p>
After I got back to the bio station I settled down and went to sleep. 
I woke up for spirit circle and breakfast, then right after I 
finished eating I sat on a couch in the main room with Tiffany Bush 
and Amber Foreman for 5 straight hours, a new personal record.  I was 
asleep for an hour, and for the last two hours, right before lunch, I 
talked with Rob and Erika.  It started out as an improvised version 
of Rob's Most Important Thing in the World workshop, but was mostly a 
conversation about the nature of god.  I'm not quite sure, so don't 
quote me, but I think we agreed that there is no single most 
important thing to do in life, because if there were it would mean 
that there is only one thing that every person is supposed to be 
doing.  In case you were wondering.
</p>
<p>
This evening we watched a couple of videos that John Thompson had 
shot of people doing wacky things.  They were hilarious and put 
together excellently.  I'm not sure if that was before or after the 
coffeehouse.
</p>
<p>
The coffeehouse was the main event tonight.  I finally got a taste of 
some excellent and enlightening groovy juice (for you, Anna) made by 
Jeremy Loomis-Norris, who, by the way, decided to follow the trend 
and have his head shaved tonight before worship.  The talent show was 
excellent and went right along with the coffeehouse.  There was a lot 
of singing and playing, and the adult staff's descriptions of 
themselves set to the tune of "Yogi Bear", and I personally formed 
1/3 of the three-headed wonder, aided by Willy Wagner and Nathan 
Sexton.
</p>
<p>
The worship tonight was late, 1:00, but it was ten times better than 
anything I had ever been to.  I don't know which was more plentiful;  
the crying, or the laughing.  I didn't cry myself, but there was lots 
of it going on around me.  I don't know why, but for some reason I 
wasn't totally into the worship.  Sure I was emotional, but not as 
much as everyone else was.
</p>
<p>
It ended eventually, then the library was used for a dance, and now 
they are watching videos in there.
</p>
<p>
Wakeup tomorrow is at 6:30, and I'll write all about the morning on 
the way home.
</p>
<p>
Yo, G'night,

<p>


Monday<br>
8/4/97<br>
8:31 am<br>


</p>
<p>I lied, I didn't write on the way home, it is now three days later 
and I am at home.  Reflecting, SWUUSI seems so close, yet so far 
away.
</p>
<p>
Wake up was at 6:30,Friday morning and I stayed up until about fifty 
minutes before that before I finally succumbed and fell asleep on a 
couch in the main room.  According to later reports of eye-witnesses, 
while I was asleep I called out for Dave and my sticks and asked 
Marie Shallin to sit beside me.
</p>
<p>
The first thing I saw when I woke up was Drill Sergeant Debbie 
yelling at me to wake up, then running around screaming randomly and 
abusing Dave, using him to hit things and make noise.  I hadn't been 
asleep for very long so I woke right up and quickly packed the few 
things I had taken out back into my bags and carried them out front 
and set them down.  As it turned out, I had a bunch of various 
belongings scattered about, and every time I turned around I thought 
of another one I had to find and pack.
</p>
<p>
Debbie told me to get the pit empty, so I went upstairs and spread 
the word, then Tia called the touch group leaders and gave them their 
choices of cleanup patrols.  I took the pavilion and the beach, so 
while three guys policed the pavilion, Willy Wagner, Nathan Sexton, 
and I combed the beach for the occasional bit of trash that had been 
dropped in the past week.  Fairly simple.  Our group hadn't left much 
trash, but the beach was already littered with every sort of junk
you can think of: motor oil and anti-freeze containers, soda cans, 
beer bottles and cans, food wrappers, bleach and milk jugs, trot 
lines, and huge mostly-rotten skeletons of catfish and gar.  The 
three of us shared thoughts about how disheartening it was to look at 
the beautiful beach junked up so badly.
</p>
<p>
We went back to the main building and things were coming along.  The 
pit was empty of people and bags so I picked up all the trash I could 
find in it.  After what seemed like a very long time all the cleaning 
was finally finished and we went to the pavilion for closing circle.  
We sang the buzzard song, and yogi bear, and passed a hug, and 
described the week by naming it an adjective, and played the knot 
game, and did the big lap sit thing, and finally the new seniors got 
in a circle in the center and led a round of good friends and while 
it was going suddenly broke out with Bish-Bish.
</p>
<p>
Then we went out front to wait and say our goodbyes there.  It was no 
fun saying goodbye, and it seemed even worse because it was so 
dragged out.  It's a lot easier to say goodbye in twenty minutes than 
it is over two hours.  My mom finally got back with the mug books, 
not quite in time to catch everybody, and the mugbooks were received 
in the cafeteria, some assembly required.  Outside, everyone was all, 
"Seeya in San Antonio, right?"  "Yeah,  you bet."  It seemed like 
forever until most of the youths were finally gone, and it was my 
turn to leave.  There were just a few people who stayed after me, and 
I said goodbye to them one last time.  Aaron Ivener rode to the lodge 
with us, so his parents could pick him up, and with our stuff and his 
stuff, including a guitar and sleeping bag and everything else, the 
entire trunk and every available inch of airspace in the car was 
filled.
</p>
<p>
We got to the lodge and Aaron got in his parent's truck, and we 
caravaned back with them and another guy, Chuck, from Jonesboro, who 
had walkie talkies that the adults played with, and we followed them 
all the way to Hot Springs where we stopped and stayed at my 
grandparent's house until the following morning, and I got a good, 
long night's sleep.  I love all you guys and I miss you a lot, and 
I'll see you whenever we meet again.
</p>
<p>
Later,<br>
Dane & Dave

                        <h1>1997 New Orleans rally review by Rob Nugen</h1>

<hr>

<p><p>
Wow
<p>
Jason Fricke, Mike Noyse, and Tony Salinas and I all drove from my apartment toward Beaumont to pick up Cathy Saur
along the way to New Orleans.  Wende could not go, though she wanted to; she was sick.
<p>
We picked up Cathy after not being able to find the house and having to call her on the car phone.  Turns out we were
pretty much right across the street from her.<br />
<p>
We stopped to get something to eat after we were most of the way there and stopped at Taco Bell.  I had wanted to
go to Wendy&rsquo;s so when I went up to the counter, I was all, &ldquo;gimme a chicken sandwich, and a medium frosty.&rdquo;
The dude was all, &ldquo;a <em>what?</em>&rdquo;    My brain clicked and I was all, &ldquo;doh!!&rdquo; etcetera.  It was pretty funny.
<p>
We got pretty much lost in New Orleans since we didn&rsquo;t have the map on the form, but we had the address and a New Orleans map.  So after driving past the Superdome, where we saw a dude with dreads down past his butt, and after driving through some partying neighborhoods, we made it to the church at like 6 or 7pm.  Early to a rally!!<br />
<p>
Big hugs to everyone and then I helped Jessica and Abby move some chairs around and get stuff ready.
People started arriving as people do at rallies and I was super impressed that I remembered Sage&rsquo;s name
all the way back from Houston Rally 1996, my first as an advisor.<br />
<p>
The normal pre-opening circle Rally Energy hummed through the group.  We played basketball, made plans for Silent Football, Animal Tag, and all kinds of craziness.  Tia Lawlor asked if we could go see Trent Reznor&rsquo;s house, which is in New Orleans.  Actually I think the word she used instead of &ldquo;see&rdquo; was &ldquo;stalk.&rdquo;<br />
<p>
I introduced a few new rally youth around to several people, until we got a match for each of them- a conversation that kept on conversing without me.  I love it when that happens.
<p>
A group was playing Wink in the chapel, led by Dan something from CMWD.  I watched.
<p>
Just before opening circle, we had a little meeting for the new rally goers.  We made sure they understood they are empowered and that everyone is equal (with the advisors being a little more equal) and that if they ever felt uncomfortable about anything, to just let somebody know.
<p>
Surprisingly, Gabe Rendon and Mike Noyse kept cutting up and goofin&rsquo; around as Debe was talking.  Debe was all, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t make me take you down.&rdquo;   Mike goes, &ldquo;you couldn&rsquo;t take an elevator down!&rdquo;     (author&rsquo;s note:  <em>Please</em> understand this was all in fun.)  Debe was left with no alternative.  She hopped out of her chair and kinda wrassled with Mike and they were both hollering and then Gabe jumped in and Mike jumped out and ran over to me for protection.  It was hilarious.
<p>
Everything back to normal, the meeting was continued, &ldquo;so anyway, we just want to let you guys know that everyone is equal and will be treated with respect.&rdquo;  Funny funny stuff.
<p>
So then we had the real opening circle and did the same cool activity as New Orleans 1996 opening circle.  Everyone had written down a question and then everyone randomly chose someone else&rsquo;s question and wrote down an answer and then everyone randomly chose a question and answer and read them out loud.  It&rsquo;s pretty fun.
<p>
I got to re-introduce the Big White Rally Book, which made its first public appearance at New Orleans 1996.  I read aloud
the entry written one year ago by Bryan Richardson, a senior at his last rally.<br />
My advertisement was effective, lots and lots of people wrote in the book this time.  Yay!
<p>
After opening circle, touch groups had their meetings, including the advisors in our own meeting.<br />
I was one of the designated awakeful persons until 7am, and the hours sure were dragging after like 5am.
<p>
The main activity in the main room was basketball.  Pretty much people were playing the entire time.  Except for
that, the rally was a gentle lower level of energy&hellip; I can&rsquo;t quite figure out why, but it just seemed that way.
<p>
At 7am I slept until breakfast at about 8something and then ate something for breakfast.  (poetic, eh?)  I had a yummy combo platter of all the sugary cereals available.<br />
I walked around a bit and then crashed back to sleep for a few hours.  I woke up around lunchtime, and was quite surprised I had slept so long.
<p>
At lunch, I talked with Dan something from CMWD and he told me some of the main differences between the cons held in that district and rallies held here.  I was astonished and quite glad to be in the Southwest District. The craziest thing they do is have home hospitality, where the conference is split up to several different houses, each taking a few youth between like midnight and 7am.  Now I may have some of my facts wrong, but that&rsquo;s what I heard, and yikes!  I like our rallies better.
<p>
More goofin&rsquo; around and one cool thing was several people helped build one of those 3D puzzle things of the White House.  That was pretty fun.<br />
<p>
Then the fabulous Spirituality of Chocolate Chip Cookie Making workshop.  Wow.   The only utensils we used were measuring cups for the flour and sugar and stuff.  Oooey gooey sugary chocolatey fun for the whole family.  I learned my lesson from last year and didn&rsquo;t get a tummy ache from eating too much dough.   One group of cookie makers for some reason (I don&rsquo;t remember exactly why, but they had a specific reason) put a lot of extra brown sugar in their mix.  The resulting dough was darker, and the resulting cookies harder, but who cares&ndash; they&rsquo;re cookies!
<p>
A couple people wanted to get a game going, so we played Elbow Tag.  I had forgotten just how tiring that game is!
We had about 8 pairs of links and then the chaser and the chased, running around the basket ball room, ducking,
running, dodging, tagging&hellip;.   Totally a great game.
We played probably 25 minutes, and then essentially everyone just quit, &ldquo;yeah, let&rsquo;s quit&rdquo; after one person suggested
quitting.  And that was it game over.  Afterward I sat sweating beside Rhoda Everett, a new advisor from Thoreau UU, south of Houston.  I invited her to play next time, but she politely declined.  Hmmmm&hellip;
<p>
After dinner, which was super wonderful lasagna homemade by Jessica Hunicke, a large group convened to play Silent Football.  I was dictator of the whole crazy ordeal.  I think we ended up with about 14 people.  (I guess that happens when
you play at 9pm instead of 2am)  It had been a while since I had been dictator, so I ended up with a few penance points,
mostly for missing peoples&rsquo; names.   We had not 1, but 3 of the can&rsquo;t-sit-still-destined-to-lose-Silent-Football types and of
those 3, Tony Salinas admitted first to having received 5 penance points.   As a result, he had to flex his pecs on
demand for the rest of the rally.
<p>
Sometime during the evening, we played a game of Psychologist.  This we played until everyone knew the secret rule
and then we started a game of Ceiling Wall Floor.  Melissa Cain and I soon chose not to play, however, believing they were messing up the game.
<p>
And then the 80s Dance Spectacular or something when everyone went to the outdoor courtyard thing to get crazy and get dancin&rsquo; and it was great.  Colored lights strung across the courtyard and cameras flashing and people dancing and other people chilling&hellip;    Nick Devereux enhanced his figure with four large balloons, though they were a bit too big for his britches.  A great time was had by all involved.
<p>
Somehow it got later and became time for the midnight worship.  Everyone lined up to go into the dining room, and we chanted two soothing repetitive repetitive chants about the 4 original elements.
Each person wrote a wish on a small piece of paper and had their hands rinsed and dried.  We sat along the perimeter
of the dining room, still chanting until everyone was in the room.   Readings were read; thoughts were said.  All the wishes
were gently burned as we meditated for our own and every other wish to come true.<br />
Each person was given a candle, and around the entire circle was passed a flame started from a candle blessed by some spiritual leader.  The candles we got to keep so that our wishes may always come true, and so that we may always remember the magic of YRUU.  Then around the circle each person received a smudge of ash from all our combined wishes.
<p>
Tears and hugs flowed freely around the room until we were all hugged out.<br />
<p>
The groups disbursed and talked until rumors of the talent show started.  I helped convert the rumors into reality and gathered everyone into the big basket ball room, nope nope wait we&rsquo;re moving to the dining hall.  The audience brought sleeping bags and pillows and snuggled up on one side of the room with me on stage on the other.
No one wanted to go first, so I began to tell a great joke.  In this case, &ldquo;great&rdquo; does not mean &ldquo;hilarious.&rdquo;  I mean &ldquo;great&rdquo; as in &ldquo;huge&rdquo; or in this case, &ldquo;long.&rdquo;   The joke is too long and pointless to tell here, but it worked as I intended.  In order to stop the madness, Mike and Gabe got up to perform another fabulous, final, ad lib beat box/rap performance.
I would still pay bucks to have one on tape.
<p>
The talent show continued, starring Abby Nance and her poems, Dane Dormio and Dave (his plunger),
Melissa Cain, Susanne Kelly and Daniel Kaminsky singing a song I didn&rsquo;t know then and don&rsquo;t remember now.
Finally, Tony Salinas performed his now infamous pecs flex, amidst much clapping, cheering, and money throwing.
What a crazy time.
<p>
Groups reformed in the outdoor dance arena, this time mostly talking in small groups of friendships that will last forever.  Debe, Tera and I sat in our own group, experiencing the beginning of forever.
<p>
I started to fall asleep outside, so inside to sleep I went.  I slept way past wake up time so I could miss the clean up festivities.  Finally got up and packed up and cruised over to get a bowl of cereal and stuff.<br />
Once we were declared clean, we rounded up into the large basket ball room for closing circle.
We sang Yogi Bear, The Beaver Song, Three Chartreuse Buzzards, and with the seniors in the center for their final closing circle, Good Friends.  The beauty of the moment flowed throughout the room, when the seniors suddenly burst forth with chanting &ldquo;Bish Bish&rdquo;    If you can call screaming at the top of your lungs chanting.
<p>
Mugbooks were passed out and most everyone filed out to pile into vehicles.
But hey- we&rsquo;re in New Orleans!  Let&rsquo;s go see the sights!
<p>
So we did.  Four minivanloads full- most of the rally went to the French Quarter to see what we could see.
I had the great fortune to drive behind Arlene, in the back of whose van Dane and Dave performed for us.
It was totally hilarious, actually.  I&rsquo;m laughing as I type.  Sorry you couldn&rsquo;t be there.
<p>
We parked and walked as a group across the street where there was a tall mannequin standing on a milk crate.  He had an old ass guitar slung around him and it only had 1 string.  Pretty funny.  Then his head moved.  Wait a minute!
So we put some dollars in his box and he belted out a couple of grand songs.  The chorus was something like,
&ldquo;cause it&rsquo;s hard&hellip;!  So hard&hellip;to play a one string guitar.&rdquo;
<p>
Across the street we went again and it was declared we have 1 hour and 5 minutes until we all have to be back right here so we can get some youth to the bus station on time.   Debe Barnes, Tera Little, Arlene Dormio and I went as a group.
The coolest things we found were a voodoo shop, where Arlene bought me a braided wish ring that will make a wish come true as the ring falls off.  And this marionette dude about 2 feet tall, lip synching to some blues music.  He had on big dark shades and a dark suit.  After singing, he walked really slowly around to greet the crowd.  He gave Debe a kiss on the cheek and gave me five. (not 5 kisses on the cheek!  you know- gimme five!)
<p>
It began to rain as it was time to regroup.   We all met back up and the sky broke open and it poured.   Several of us had great fun sliding across the water soaked little pebble stone sidewalks.  I love doing that.  It was a bit tough without shoes on, but great fun.   That reminds me-  I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I would need shoes to walk around in the French Quarter, so I carried my sandals.  I never needed them.  I probably would have to go get something to eat, but just for your info- you really don&rsquo;t need shoes to go into most shops in the French Quarter.
<p>
As we were walking back to the cars, Austin Roth, Bryan Beck and I all practiced our beat box capabilities, having been so impressed with Gabe&rsquo;s the previous night at the talent show.  Oddly enough, Jason Fricke had jumped on my back piggy back style, so there we were, part of a large group of eclectic teens with chattering voices and beat boxing and soaking wet clothing and a punk looking youth with army boots on the back of a barefoot beatboxing guy with a frisbee.  Wow.
<p>
We got back to the cars and hung out and still hadn&rsquo;t gotten enough of the love from this beautiful community.  So we went to get something to eat!  Actually, Arlene had to get going back home, so we hugged them all and said our goodbyes.<br />
So we all followed Debe and, much to my pleasant surprise, went to Wendy&rsquo;s!  Yay!  I got my beloved Frosty and chicken samwich and I was set.
<p>
We ate and laughed and talked and talked and went outside and could not bear to say goodbye.  &ldquo;See ya at SWUUSI&rdquo; was the most common phrase, although it didn&rsquo;t apply to everyone.  We hugged and talked in the parking lot for fully 20 minutes.   Finally, finally, we realized we did have to go home.  What a moment.
<p>
On the way home I made it about 2 hours before I had to have Cathy some sit up front and chat with me so I could maintain an awakeful state of mind.   It torentially rained, and then it was sunny, and then it rained again and was sunny.  We got delayed by two accidents, one involving an 18 wheeler sideways on the highway, only allowing 1 land by on the left and a few cars by in the shoulder on the right.
<p>
We made it to Cathy&rsquo;s house and gave hugs and continued toward Houston.  The conversation turned to drug legalization and discussion about abusive language and finally we made it home.  John Salinas, Tony&rsquo;s dad, picked em all up- Mike Noyse, Jason Fricke and Tony Salinas.</p>

<p><p>I went inside and slept.</p>

<p><p>See ya at SWUUSI!!!!!!!</p>

<p><p>With Love<br>
- Rob</p>

                        <h1>1997 New Orleans rally review by Dane Dormio</h1>

<hr>

<p>
I have never been to the New Orleans rally before, but from what I 
have heard about it, this year's Fire-themed get-together lived up to 
the New Orleans UU church's reputation of a great rally.  This year I 
rode with my mom and brought along with me a new guy, AJ, who will be 
a fellow student with me next year at the Arkansas School for 
Mathematics and Sciences.  Dave the plunger also came along.
</p>
<p>
The drive alone took us about 8 hours, but we were held up for about 
two hours with van trouble along the way.  Nothing serious, and we 
made it the rest of the way there and back with no trouble at all.  
We forgot to bring the map to the church, so as soon as we got into 
New Orleans we stopped at a gas station and called the church, got 
its address from the answering machine, then found it not too far 
from where we were.
</p>
<p>
This rally was a lock-in, so after I got there and went inside I came 
back out and brought all my stuff in for the night.  I looked through 
all the registration forms and found out who was there, but because 
of the lateness of the hour (3:00 am) a lot of people were asleep so 
I had to wait until later that morning to see some of them.  There 
was still plenty of energy, though, and I walked into the gym to find 
a basketball game in progress.  I got my picture taken with Dave and 
Frank, then stayed up the rest of the night visiting and figuring out 
where everything was in the church.  There were about as many new 
people as there had been at Tulsa, most of them from Baton Rouge, so 
I had plenty of people to get acquainted with.
</p>
<p>
When breakfast was served I was doing something and missed it, which 
was okay because I wasn't hungry anyway.  While Nick Deveraux was 
asleep on the loveseat in the boy's sleeping room with his head 
laying back on the arm and his mouth hanging wide open, looking 
absolutely hilarious, I came in and took a picture of him.  Not much 
happened until lunch.  I greeted the people who had been asleep when 
I came in, and one time when I was standing in the hall John Thompson 
came up behind me and grabbed me, and I was very pleasantly surprised 
because I hadn't even known he was there.
</p>
<p>
Lunch was some rice stuff, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian, and 
salad.  It was pretty good and not standard rally-fare, but I don't 
know what it was called.  In retrospect it seems like there was a 
little less buzzing-type energy in the air than usual, as if people 
mostly just sat around.  One time I was sitting on a bench in the 
gym looking at some pictures from Dallas and Nick Deveraux mentioned 
that everybody was just sitting around, and he would expect me, of 
all people, to be up and doing something, so I got up and attacked 
him.  We wrestled around for a few minutes until we got hot and 
sweaty.  This was just before lunch.
</p>
<p>
Sometime after lunch and before the workshops (I think) I became part 
of a pile of bodies in the boy's sleeping room, an activity which 
deserves a name, in which we managed to fit eight people onto a 
two-person love seat all at the same time.  
</p>
<p>
I did a little nail-painting in the short amount of time before the 
workshops began.  I was given misinformation about the guided 
meditation workshop and it ended right when I thought it was supposed 
to be starting.  I went to the cookie workshop instead, and I mixed 
the ingredients while Dave supervised the goings-on.  There were two 
batches, one with huge chocolate chips and one with small chocolate 
chips.  I did the mixing of the batch with the small chips along with 
help from the others.  We got the cookies in the oven and they came 
out a little crunchy but were alright.
</p>
<p>
Shortly after the workshops was dinner, excellent microwave lasagna, 
and then after that I think was a game of silent football with Rob as 
the dictator.  I may have the order of some of these events mixed up, 
but as best as I can recall I got all the important ones.  Tony lost 
silent football, and his penance was that he had to jiggle his pecs 
on demand for the rest of the rally.  The fiesta was supposed be 
next, but it wasn't much and didn't happen until after worship.
</p>
<p>
Worship was, as promised, emotionally charged (kick-ass).  It was 
held at midnight and everyone was required to participate.  We all 
lined up in the hallway and the lights were turned off, and a few at 
a time we walked down a hall lined with candles and wrote a wish on a 
piece of paper, then washed our hands in perfumed water and dried 
them before entering a room with some candles and other things in the 
center where we made a circle around the outer edge.  While we 
were doing this we were chanting a pagan song about the elements.  
When everybody got into the room, Abby did the worship-type 
speaking, and the wishes were put into a can and burned.  Some more 
worship-type speaking, and then everybody got small birthday candles 
and passed a flame of love all the way around the circle.  The ashes 
from the burned wishes were mixed with water and smeared on the 
cheeks of all the participants, with the words "May the Spirit of 
Fire be with you".  Maiah made a joke out of this by hugging 
people while turning her cheek and saying, "Kiss my ash."  After the 
official circle broke up, most of the participants stayed in the room 
and we got very emotional.  There was a lot of crying, mostly because 
of this being the absolute last, no-more-chances, this is it, we're 
not kidding, final rally of the year.  The emotions were very strong 
and the embraces were plentiful, and the love flowed freely for a 
very long time.
</p>
<p>
Eventually the mood livened up, and the lights were turned back on, 
and we were ready for the talent show.  First up I think were Gabe 
and Mike, doing their thing one last time, and then I demonstrated 
some of the many uses and talents of Dave the plunger.  He is an 
exercise partner, a self-defense weapon, a hula-hoop expert, a 
gymnast,  a great mathematician (although he is not the best public 
speaker), he can fly short distances, with a lot of patience he can 
give a huge hickey, and a few other things that I have forgotten.  
Then I did my "Oh, What a Luxury" poem from SWUUSI last year, and 
before I quit I led the rain thing where everybody makes noises in 
unison.  Then Abby read a couple of her poems, one of which won a 
national award, and Tony did the pec thing, and I can't remember what 
the rest of the acts were.
</p>
<p>
It was three a.m. by the time the talent show was over, a little 
later than usual, so most of the people who would have gone to bed 
earlier were still up.  I was ready to start up a batch of Groovy 
Juice, which I had been planning for a while, and I had recruited 
some of the best help around, but to my dismay all the things in the 
kitchen that would have made Groovy Juice were not designated for 
YRUU use, so we couldn't use them.  I was really disappointed, 
because I was going to make a special batch and dedicate it in honor 
of Anna Magwood, who couldn't be at the rally due to cruel and unfair 
employers.  Sorry, Anna.
</p>
<p>
The fiesta happened next, and as I said before it wasn't much, just 
some pretty lights strung up around the courtyard and a little music 
and dancing.  When everybody settled down sufficiently I got enough 
people together to play Psychiatrist, which hadn't been played since 
San Antonio and was due for a go around.
</p>
<p>
I stayed up until fairly late the next morning just wandering around 
and talking, and finally fell asleep in the sanctuary shortly before 
wake-up.
</p>
<p>
When we got up in the morning I struggled to maintain an upright 
position while mopping the boy's bathroom.  When we could go outside 
I carried my stuff out to the car and waited for breakfast.  Contrary 
to the norm, it wasn't doughnuts but was the usual cereal and orange 
juice.  When it was finished and mostly cleaned up, closing circle 
gathered in the gym.  We sang Yogi Bear, the Buzzard song, the Beaver 
song, and when the six seniors who were there had their circle in the 
middle we sang Good Friends.  In an exciting burst of energy the 
seniors started Bish Bish right in the middle of a verse and I joined 
in with all my might.  Then the mugbooks were handed out and we all 
went outside, but most of the goodbyes weren't said yet.  When we 
left the majority of us went downtown to the French quarter and 
acted like tourists for about an hour.  On the way there Dave and I 
got in the back of the van and entertained Rob and his youth, who 
were driving behind us.
</p>
<p>
For most of the time I walked around the French quarter I was with 
Tia, Katie, Kitty, and AJ.  We went into several shops and Tia bought 
some beads and a black boa, kitty bought a mask and a white boa, and 
I bought a red boa to go along with the rally shirt and another 
tee-shirt that said I was a certified muff-diving instructor and had 
a big design on the back.  AJ bought one of those long skinny clamp 
things with an alligator head and a pair of black boxers with red 
peppers all over them.
</p>
<p>
We got back to where we were all supposed to meet a little earlier 
than the scheduled time, so we went into a nearby ice-cream shop and 
I shared a banana split with Tia.  About the time we were supposed to 
meet it started raining, and Gabe and Mike discovered a great 
pebble-covered sidewalk that you could run and slide a long way on, 
but my thick boots didn't do nearly as well on it as tennis shoes.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately it didn't rain for very long and we didn't get too wet.  
When we were walking back to where we had all parked Dave got 
friendly with a Lexus that pulled up to us while we were crossing a 
street.  The guy driving didn't like it too much.
</p>
<p>
We did most of our goodbyes in the parking lot, and all of the 
crying had been done the night before so they were mostly cheerful 
and happy.  When I finally got around to letting go and getting in 
the van, we drove off and the last thing I remember seeing was a 
picture-perfect memory that will probably stick in my mind as long as 
I live:  looking out the back window, I saw Gabe and Mike sitting on 
some steps just hanging out, and they looked so content in the 
perfect scenery, with the wet trees and the dim cloud darkened sky.  
There is really something special about two guys who are such good 
friends for so long.  It was a perfect way to remember the last time 
I saw them.
</p>
<p>
So another rally is ended, and another day, and another review, and 
another chapter in the book of life, and that is the way it is must 
be.  A peaceful goodbye, y'all, and see you in three weeks for 
SWUUSI.
</p>
<p>
With much Love,
</p>
<p>
Dane Allen Dormio and Dave the Plunger

<p><p class=note>(transcribed out of my diary)</p>
<p>
Wende and I are in New Braunfels at her parents&rsquo; house.  We went to Schlitterbahn today&ndash;my first time there&ndash;and had a ton of fun.  There are 3 separate parks.
<p>
I was most technologically impressed with the water coaster.  The water pressure accelerated the tube boats up up up so they could slide down then up then down and the key was (of all things) large holes in the bottom of the up ramps which let out the water that was no longer going up so that it wouldn&rsquo;t slow the boat.<br>
Torrents of water fell splashing all over the ground, usually where people could walk &amp; get drenched.
<p>
Second most technologically impresive was the Boogie Bahn, a surfing wave thing with water shootin&rsquo; down into a large trough and then back up and out/over the other side.  I did it twice, much much much better the second time when I stayed surfin&rsquo; (on my tummy on the board) for about a full minute. Very cool.  But we did not bring a camera.
<p>
I really enjoyed circling around a perpetual water circle cycle / wave pool thing.  Went around it about 6 times.  I treaded water for 105 wave cycles in a small wave pool.  I enjoyed the exertion.
<p>
My favorite ride at the first section of Schlitterbahn wound its way through the trees and down down all around and then bububububububububububububub fast down to the end.
<p>
I zipped down a body slide chute and down one that required a board or something like that.  The only thing I did not find was a slide or thing or anything that had blinding white knuckle incredible speed.  Closest was the surf thing and exertion at the wave pool. No speed but exertion.
<p></p>

                        <h1>1997 Tulsa rally review by Rob Nugen</h1>

<hr>

<p><p>
Wow.
<p>
9 hours is not so bad if you have 3 drivers.  However, it&rsquo;s kinda cramped
when you have 8 people in a 7 passenger minivan.  But for a rally, we&rsquo;ll
do anything.  On the way up from Houston to Tulsa were 3 advisors: Rob Nugen
(that&rsquo;s me), Wende Whitlock, and Dierdre Hammons, and 5 youth: Mike Noyse,
Charlotte Benbenek-Price, Jon Whitten-Lege, Tony Salinas, and April Ambrose.
That is an unusually high ratio of advisors to youth, but no one seemed to mind.
<p>
We left Houston at around 3pm and got to Tulsa at like 12:30am.  Surprisingly,
we were not the last group to show up.  A lot of the youth from Tulsa were all
rally virgins, so I knew none of the first people who ran screaming up to greet
us.  Some of the youth knew each other, though:  Mike Noyse said to someone,
&ldquo;oh hey- you remember those shoes you gave me 2 years ago and I said I would
give you 20 bucks for them?  I&rsquo;ve got the 20 bucks.&rdquo;  We joked about him instead
concluding, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the shoes.&rdquo;
<p>
Inside we registered and posed for mugbook pictures and talked and played a
huge game of Twister where they had 12 Twister mats all spread across the floor
and various people twisting across the mats.  We played fooz ball, pool, ping
pong and talked and goofed around until a line of people holding hands began to
snake through the two rooms and collect people on its ever-lengthening tail until
the entire rally was a long hand-holdin&rsquo; line walking outside
to the large dining hall
for opening circle.<br />
<p>
We circled and opened the rally by each person asking a personal question of the
person to his or her right, who introduced him or herself and answered the
questions.  I was asked (by Mike Moren, I think) &ldquo;what is the worst
pick-up line you&rsquo;ve used?&rdquo;  I said I don&rsquo;t have any pick-up lines&ndash;I
just charm people with my smile,
which understandably illicited many groans from the rest of the group.
<p>
After opening circle, we cruised back to the main building and had touch group
meetings.  Advisors talked advisor stuff upstairs and the various youth touch
groups talked youth stuff all over the place.  Then the groups dispersed and
I went back down to the game room.  I don&rsquo;t currently remember what I did, but
I remember reminding everyone at 4am that we were supposed to be awake in 3.5
hours for the ropes course, and that I was going to bed.
<p>
Slept, got up, went outside to find Mike Noyse and Gabe Rendon creating large
sidewalk chalk drawings in the parking lot.  I don&rsquo;t know the current jargon,
but Gabe had drawn some hip hoppin&rsquo; guy flipping his middle finger right out
at you and holding a cigarette fully 4 feet long.  Pretty impressive art
for overnight sidewalk chalk drawings&hellip;
<p>
We piled everyone and everything into the cars and drove to the YMCA for a
day of fun in the sun.   First thing I did was ask the main ropes course dude
if I could go barefoot on the course.  He said, &ldquo;no sir.  You may walk anywhere
you want on the ground without shoes, but not on the course.  There may be a
wire pulled loose from one of the cables, and it could stab you pretty well.&rdquo;
That is one good reason that I had not considered.
<p>
We tossed all our junk in the pavillion and split into two groups.  Before the
groups were split, I mentally decided to go with the group that does the low
ropes stuff first.  I determined that way I would wear my feet out to the point
that I wouldn&rsquo;t mind wearing shoes on the course.  I was correct.  But don&rsquo;t
tell anyone.
<p>
We played several games.  The coolest 5 that I remember are<br>
<ol>
<li><b>Mafia</b> Where the group makes a circle and copies the motions that the
gang boss is making in order to conceal the identity of the boss.
IT, the detective,
tries to determine who&rsquo;s the boss.</li>
<li><b>Multiple Dodgeball</b> (I made that name up) where the whole group runs around
and tries not to get hit by any of many balls being thrown around.  If you are hit,
you have to kneel down until whoever tagged you is hit, and then you can get up and
play again.  It&rsquo;s quite a fun and tiring game.</li>
<li><b>Hackey Ball</b> (I made that name up) Using the same balls, we tried to
keep them from hitting the ground.  We were allowed to use our hands, but only
got points for not using our hands.</li>
<li><b>Lava</b> (I made that name up)  We were split into two groups and each group
was given 4 small pieces of carpet.  We had to get everyone across the lava (grass)
without touching the lava, or leaving pieces of carpet unattended.</li>
<li><b>Rope Crossing</b> (of course I made that name up) We had to get the entire
group over a rope without touching it, but with each member of the group always touching
at least one other member of the group.  I got to jump over first, and we developed
a technique where basically people were lifted up onto my back and slid down (hopefully)
into the arms of the group.  I used Dane Dormio and someone else as stable bases on the
opposite side of the rope and we tossed everyone over.  Quite fun.  Curtis MacCormack
completed the process by jumping over the rope and doing a half-twist to make it
look cool.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Then it was time for lunch.
<p>
We ate and played frisbee a bit and I climbed all over the swingset.  The break was
not tremendously long before it was time for our group to do the high ropes course
stuff.  Yay!!
<p>
Bud was our main adult leader dude, and he showed us the ropes, and everything we
would need to know about them.
<p>
&ldquo;Spotter ready?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Spotter ready.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Climbing?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Climb on!&rdquo;<br>
<p>
Up the first pole and then walk up the next slanted log, then climb some more to the
next horizontal log.  Walk across the horizontal log being careful not to hurt the
leaves of the tree branch brushing across it.  Then
<p>
&ldquo;Transfering!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Transfer On!&rdquo;<br>
<p>
and you switch to the next safety rope thing.
<p>
&ldquo;Transfer complete!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Show me!&rdquo;<br>
And you show &lsquo;em.<br>
&ldquo;Squeeze me!&rdquo;<br>
And you squeeze &lsquo;em.<br>
&ldquo;Transfer complete!&rdquo;<br>
<p>
And you jump/step across to a suspended lily pad thing and
across to a stable platform and switch to the next rope thing.
<p>
&ldquo;Transfering!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Transfer On!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Transfer complete!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Show me!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Squeeze me!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Transfer complete!&rdquo;<br>
<p>
And then along a long long single cable with ropes hanging above
it about 5 feet long and 5 feet apart.  They call this section the
grape vine, and it was the first where
you actually step on a single cable, and I quickly realized I was
glad to be wearing my shoes.
<p>
&ldquo;Transfering!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Transfer On!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Transfer complete!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Show me!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Squeeze me!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Transfer complete!&rdquo;<br>
<p>
And then along the &ldquo;Charlie Chaplin&rdquo; lines, two parallel cables that you
kinda shuffle across.  The right foot cable hung several inches lower than
the other, so I just used the left cable.
<p>
&ldquo;Transfering!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Transfer On!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Transfer complete!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Show me!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Squeeze me!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Transfer complete!&rdquo;<br>
<p>
And along the last cable, with a cable about 3.5 feet above it as a handle.
It was about 60 feet long.<br>
At the end of this set of cables was Pam, sitting on a platform about 40 or 50
feet in the air helping people switch to the last safety rope, the one for the
zip cord.  I talked to her for a few minutes, asking about her work and stuff.
I yelled stuff like, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared!&rdquo; to the people at the bottom waiting for me
to zip, and did a one foot shakey wavey dance to show how off balance and nervous
I was (not).  I appreciated the view for a moment and then gave Pam a hug.
&ldquo;Thank you, Pam, for all your help out here.&rdquo;
<p>
&ldquo;Clear??&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Clear!!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Zipping??&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Zip On, BA-BYYY!!!!<br>
<p>
And jump and zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzeeeeeeeeewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!!!!
down the long long long cable 35 m.p.h. upside down past the people at the bottom
and slow then backwards upside down zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz past them again and then
crazy legs sideways zzzzzzzz past them again and then zzz and grab the rope and
attach it to my cable and stop and unhook and down the ladder safely to the ground.
<p>
Wild awesome fabulous fun.
<p>
I helped out with the group helping people get down off the zip line until I
helped Wende go through the ropes course itself.  There was a delay, so she had
to stay up there a bit longer than most people.  I yelled, &ldquo;Wende!  Yell, &lsquo;Chilling!&rsquo;
so I can yell, &lsquo;Chill On!&rsquo;&rdquo;  but she didn&rsquo;t think that was very funny.
<p>
After everyone had gone, we cruised back to the pavillion and chilled.
Soon, the pool was open, so we got to go play in the pool.  Yay!  I mostly
played a game of Marco Polo with Frank Roesler, Dane Dormio, Nick Grunewald,
Mike Moren, and a few others but I don&rsquo;t remember who.  (it&rsquo;s been too long since
the rally!)  We got bored of &ldquo;Marco&rdquo; followed by &ldquo;Polo&rdquo; so we started doing all
variety of name associations from people first and last names, to days of the
week, to articles of clothing, to song lyrics, to record labels.  Crazy..
<p>
We got bored of the whole game, though not quite as bored, I&rsquo;m sure, as the life
guards, and went to eat, because it was dinnertime!  Yay!
<p>
We ate and
I grabbed my frisbee and went to the basketball court and we got a game of
frisbee going.  I was glad for the chance to help a few youth learn how to throw
and for a few other youth to throw better.  I love that.  We played for probably
an hour or hour-na-half and it was great.
<p>
Worship was awesome, though difficult to hear over the crackling of the fire
and singing of some youth.  We did a round of Unreturned Love (that&rsquo;s not what
it&rsquo;s called but I can&rsquo;t remember the name) where half the group stands with
eyes closed and the other half walks around and hugs everyone.  Then the sides
switch and you do it again.  It&rsquo;s great; I&rsquo;ll suggest we do that at SWUUSI.
<p>
We cruised back to the church and hung out until time for the Love Feast.
This one was held outside and was much more gentle and sane than the
notorious New Orleans Love Feast turned Food Fling Festival from last year.
I ate a crazy mixture of cheese, M&amp;Ms, carrots, crackers, fruit, over and over
until I was just barfily full.  Thanks to everyone who helped.
<p>
Back inside we chilled more, until some people suggested
getting together a talent show.  Unfortunately, as I was walking around
inviting people to the show, I got pulled into a hasty meeting.<br />
Some youths had broken the no smoking rule and we had to figure out what
to do.  Shit.  I did not want to deal with the situation, but we
decided what would be appropriate and talked to the youths in question
and told them their punishment and blah.  Done.  I hate having to do that.
<p>
Soon thereafter, I was invited to a game of Truth or Dare.  Oh no.<br />
My better judgement said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t play&rdquo; but I did anyway.  We had fun.
I won&rsquo;t name names, and in fact, I won&rsquo;t even say what happened.
You&rsquo;ll have to ask.  It wasn&rsquo;t as bad as you&rsquo;re thinking.
<p>
Okay, fine.  One youth got a swirly, one youth got naked (alone)
in the elevator,
one youth put their underwear in the middle of the circle, and
then I had to go get some sleep.
<p>
We got up, cleaned up, packed up, and had closing circle.  The
seniors had senior circle in the middle, and then we all did a big tight
spiral hug around them.  Nice.
<p>
Muffins and juice for the ride home and we left.<br>
I talked to Charlotte Benbenek-Price about Marilyn Manson.  We wondered
about the band and about Mr Manson&rsquo;s motivations for things.  <br>
I was introduced to Type O-Negative, a cool group that my brain
is thinking had a sound like a smooth industrial, ambient mix.<br />
Fun stuff.
<p>
Also weird was Ben Atkinson&rsquo;s Bizarre magazine.  I&rsquo;m glad my small
part of the world does not include some of the crazy stuff in there.
<p>
Have a great day!<br>
- Rob</p>

                        <h1>1997 Tulsa rally review by Dane dormio</h1>

<hr>

<p>Well, two years, twelve rallies and two SWUUSIs later, I finally
got to go back to the site of my first rally, the All Souls UU
church in Tulsa.  I&rsquo;m sure anyone who has been going to rallies for a
while will understand how special a place this was for me.  It was
great to see the old church again and think about how completely
different a person I am now than I was then.  All the familiar sights
were etched in my memory, and it seemed like nothing had changed.  A
wonderful experience.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>Other than that, I must admit, I expected the Tulsa &lsquo;97 rally to be
the only bad one I had ever been to.  Boy, was I wrong.  It was a
very non-standard rally experience and will definitely stand out
among the rest in the future.  One non-standard thing was, of course,
the notorious anti-smoking rule.  Both sides of this battle deserve
to be commended:  the Tulsa church for standing up and saying &ldquo;No
Smoking&rdquo; (that took a lot of guts), and the smokers who came anyway
and put up with the rule with very little friction.  But there were
also other things that made this rally different.  It was probably
the smallest one I&rsquo;ve ever been to; I would estimate about 40 people
were there, give or take a few.  It seemed like at least a quarter of
these were rally virgins from Tulsa.  I had no idea they had such a
large youth group.  There was also a Love Feast, which is rare.<br />
Then, of course, there was the church it was in, which is a big thing
in itself.  And, probably the most unusual, the R.O.P.E.S. course at
the YMCA that took up most of the day Saturday.  What a rush!
</p>
<p></p>

<p>For me, one other thing that made this rally unique was an
extra-special friend I made Thursday night who came with me:  Dave,
the plunger.  Sure, he&rsquo;s non-human, but non-human objects are
people too, and most people take for granted just how much life,
warmth, and personality plungers can have when you look at one of
them carefully enough and give it a fair chance.  All they want is to
be treated equally and given the love that any other person would
expect, not for their physical appearance alone, but for what a
beautiful, twinkling, caring soul lies within the flimsy rubber
shell.  Dave is a true plunger pioneer, and he had a lot of fun at
the rally and made a lot of good friends.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>My mom couldn&rsquo;t come to this rally, so Dave and I rode in a van with
Gene Hudnall, Nick Grunewald, Helen Cole, and Gene&rsquo;s mom Sheila, all
from Little Rock.  About the time we got into Tulsa, we realized that
none of us had bothered to bring a map to the church, which was no
big deal because a nice man at a gas station knew right where it was.
It was relatively early when we arrived, a little before ten o&rsquo;clock,
and the only people there were Tera Little and her two YUUTEs from
Fayetteville, Andy and Laura Andrews from Tyler, TX, Ben Atkinson, who
had flown in, and a large number of people from the Tulsa youth
group.  Getting to rallies early is a mixed blessing; you get to meet
everyone else as they arrive, but you have to wait, at a time when
you are about to explode with happy energy.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>Eventually people arrived from Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and OKC,
and opening circle was postponed half an hour to wait for the
stragglers because there were so few of us.  For the ice breaker,
everyone in the circle asked the person to his or her right a
get-to-know-you question, and that person answered, and it went all
the way around.  Then everything for tomorrow was explained, all the
rules, boundaries, etc.  When we were dismissed, we all went
back to the main part of the church and had touch group meetings.<br />
There weren&rsquo;t really any big, clear rooms where there was a lot of
space to run around, so the general partying was more mild than
usual, and people either sat on any of the numerous couches or played
pool or ping-pong.  There was also the art wall in the Sponge Room,
which had been painted over since the last rally, and it was soon
totally covered in magic-marker graffiti.  Since the group was so
small, the atmosphere was less energetic, but no less cheery, than
normal.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>In the morning breakfast was cooked and eaten, and shortly
afterwards everyone piled back into their vehicles and we all
caravanned to the Westside YMCA for a day of fun in the trees.  </p>
<p></p>

<p>As soon as we got there, the six touch groups were divided up and
three were taken directly to the R.O.P.E.S. course while the other
three played rally-variety games in a grassy field.  Dave and I were
in the latter group, so we spent the first hour or two running around
in the sun playing while the other group was gliding through the
trees.  We had a little bit of fun and learned a few fun new games,
like a weird form of dodge ball which will probably be played again,
but most of the time I would have rather just sat in the shade.  It
was hot!  We took a long break for lunch, then went back to playing
games.  The last thing we did was try to get everyone over a rope
strung between two trees.  The drawback was that we couldn&rsquo;t touch
the rope, and everyone had to be touching someone else the whole
time.  Rob was our pillar of strength for this little exercise;
he leaned out over the rope and as we handed them over he let the
whole group slide down his back to a gaggle of waiting arms on the
other side, one person at a time.  Curtis was the last one over, and
touching Rob across the rope he did an effortless little hop/spin
right over, completing the exercise.  Impressive.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>We took a second, shorter break to eat, drink, and rest before
heading up to the R.O.P.E.S. course.  There we were given a crash
course on all the procedures and things we would need to know in
order to not die.  It was fairly simple once you got the hang of it.
After watching a few other people go before me, it was my turn to don
the safety rope and climb the pillar.  Dave stayed behind and
watched, because the course was too dangerous for plungers, and he
had plenty to keep him busy besides.  The first thing I did was hook
the safety line to the loop on my harness, then I climbed up the
thick wooden pole with my spotter Tom making sure I didn&rsquo;t fall.<br />
Just like I had seen it done before, I walked out across the log,
just as calm as could be.  About halfway across, though, I started to
think about what I was doing and was hit by a twinge of nervousness.<br />
I pushed it out of my mind and tried to be as relaxed as possible
from then on.  I got to the end of that one and climbed up to the
next one, and walked across it to the starting platform.  I changed
safety lines, then hopped out onto the wobbly &ldquo;lilly pad&rdquo; suspended
thirty feet in the air, and bounded across to the next platform.  I
changed safety lines again, then started across a twenty-to
thirty-yard open stretch, balancing on a single wire and using my
safety line to hold myself up and pulling myself across by ropes that
were dangling every few feet.  I made my wobbly way across and hugged
the next pole as soon as it was within reach.  I crawled around it
and stood on the two wires running out from the other side to change
safety lines again, then made my way across them about ten feet in
the same manner as I had gone across the other wire.  This one didn&rsquo;t
have the suspended ropes, and it was a little more wobbly, but it
wasn&rsquo;t nearly as long as the first stretch so it was easier.  At the
end of it was another platform where I changed safety lines again and
took off on another set of wires.  These were three wires running one
above the other, and they turned to the right at a 90 degree angle
to the wires I had just navigated.  My feet were balancing on the
bottom wire, my safety line was attached to the top one, and I was
holding onto the middle one to keep myself up.  That stretched out
for about another twenty or thirty yards, and when I got off it, Pam,
one of the YMCA adults running the course, helped me onto her
platform and I put the zipper line on and shucked my old safety line.
When everything was clear, I jumped off the platform and went
whizzing down through the air at all the people, and zipped past them
at a breezy 35 m.p.h.  I ran out of momentum and flew back a little
slower, then cycled by a third and fourth time, and the fourth time I
was going slow enough that I could grab a rope from someone on the
ground and pull myself over to the ladder and climb down.  The wind
had cooled me off nicely, and I sat at the shady picnic table with
Dave and waited for everybody else to finish.  The course was unfair
to Rob, because he had to put shoes on for it, but he did it anyway.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>The rest of the evening was free time.  The pool didn&rsquo;t open until
six, so people found other ways to pass the time until then.  Food
was being served all the time, and there was much more than enough of
it.  I started to go canoeing with Nick Grunewald, but when I got
there I found out that the &ldquo;pond&rdquo; was nothing but an oversized puddle
of slightly diluted mixed animal waste products that probably had a
microbial count of fifteen billion deadly, germy, sharp-clawed and
pointy-teethed, highly infectious, very very mean and out-to-get-me
unpleasant organisms per cubic milliliter, and all they wanted was
just a chance to touch a single skin cell and invade my body and
liquefy my brain and internal organs, rot out my bowels, and turn my
skin into stone.  Not to mention the rather offensive odor.  Dave and
I left right away.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>Later hamburgers and veggie burgers were cooked, and all the usual
cookout food.  There were people playing on the playground, playing
basketball, and just sitting around the pavilion talking.  When the
pool opened, quite a few people got in and swam.  Dave sat on the
side and soaked up the mild evening sun, because he is not the best
of swimmers, although he does do a really good impersonation of a
jellyfish underwater.  (Dave is a plunger of many hidden talents.<br />
For instance, he is a hula-hoop expert.)  I played Marco Polo with a
large group of people for quite some time.  To make it more
interesting, we used a few new techniques that Nick Grunewald came up
with:  Submarine, where you could open your eyes underwater and move
around, and Radar, where you could open your eyes above water but you
couldn&rsquo;t move.  When I was It, I made it a personal challenge to
catch Rob, who&rsquo;s hair had grown out a little bit since Ft. Worth, but
somehow, I kept ending up with Nick instead. One time I
grabbed somebody and thought I had finally gotten ahold of Rob and I
was doing a victory yell, but when I opened my eyes I saw I had Mike
Moren instead.  By the way, Rob, your hair looks really cute like
that; just long enough to cover your head.  You should keep it that
length.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>We were the last ones in the pool, staying until well after dinner
had officially been served.  We all walked back to the pavilion
together and ate, and the evening was getting on when I went
swimming again at about 9 o&rsquo;clock.  Besides me and Dave in the pool,
there was also BEN Atkinson and Kim Strouble.  Later Bryan
Beck came and told me how silly I was to be in the pool with my jeans
on, but I guess my hypnotic body language had a profound effect on
him, because in a few minutes he did the same thing.  Stacy came in
for a little while, and it was about fifteen minutes before ten when
we finally left.  It was, of course, dark, and almost time for
worship to start.  At ten thirty we all walked in a line down a trail
to where the park employees had set up a big bonfire for us.  We
surrounded it in a circle, and I stood as close to it as I could
endure so my jeans would dry out.  The worship was put on by Emily
Stainer, and it was something I had never seen before which was
similar to a whispering circle, except here the emphasis was more on
touching and feeling than speaking.  It was an exercise in
unconditional love.  The circle was divided in half, and first one
side closed its eyes and the other side moved over to it while
everybody loved on and said nice things to the people with their eyes
closed, who were not allowed to respond in any way.  Then the circle
reformed and the sides switched.  My side was doing the loving first,
and I took my time and gave a warm, personalized verbal love note to
everybody I loved on, so I only got to about half of them before time
ran out.  Then I went back to my spot near the fire and tried to keep
my eyes closed while I got loved unconditionally, but I couldn&rsquo;t help
peeking a few times.  Once somebody played with my nipples, and
once somebody gave me a short, soothing backrub then stuck his
wet finger in my ear (gee, I wonder who that could have BEN?!), but
it was all friendly and pleasant.  It was over too soon, then we got
with our touch groups and each of us found a twig.  The twigs were
supposed to represent a challenge which we had either in the past,
present, or future, one we had overcome or gained ground on, or were
still fighting with.  We shared the challenge with our touch group if
we wanted, then the twigs were gathered up and tied into a bundle
which was gathered into the larger community bundle, which was thrown
into the fire and we had a long moment of silence while it burned.
Then we were asked again to share our challenges with the whole group
if we wanted.  My challenge was growing up.  That has always been my
challenge, and just recently in my life I realized it, and I have
actively been making it my goal, even though I know I&rsquo;ll never be
finished.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>Before we broke up we all got close and sang Good Friends, then when
everybody else left I stayed behind and stood close to the fire
because my pants were still wet and by sheer luck I made a new friend
in the process.  When we thought everybody else was getting ready
to leave, we walked away slowly and sat down a distance away from the
fire.  In just a couple of minutes two of the park employees walked
by us dragging a hose to put the fire out with.  They started
drenching the once-grand fire and I couldn&rsquo;t stand to look at it, so
since they couldn&rsquo;t see me I reached out and kinked the hose.  A
worthless gesture, I know, but just to mess with them I kinked it and
unkinked it several times at irregular intervals before I got up and
walked away.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>At rallies most people go through emotional phases, and this was the
time during the rally when I was a little sluggish and very patient,
when I took my time doing everything and had that wonderful, content
feeling where my heart swells up and I love everybody so much that I
would be happy no matter what was going on around me and I just want
to hug and love and linger on every person that I see.  A bad time
for this to happen, because the other people in my van were in a
hurry to leave so we could follow the caravan back to the church.  I
took my time and walked slowly getting my stuff back into the van and
we were the last ones to leave.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>As soon as I got back to the church, Dave and I had to go help
prepare the food for the Love Feast.  We cut up a watermelon which
turned out to be no good, but we had other watermelons and there
was plenty of food anyway.  My touch group prepared apples,
watermelon chunks, bananas (not the best fingerfood), cheese,
goldfish, gummi bears, M&amp;Ms, chocolate chips, baby carrots,
and crackers, and we carried them all outside to the parking lot and
got everybody together for the Love Feast. This was the first Love
Feast I actually attended, and the first one at a rally I have been
to.  It wasn&rsquo;t the best place to walk around in bare feet, especially
with the gummi bears and bananas, but I enjoyed myself still.  When
we were feeding each other a guy drove up in a BMW.  He was visiting
one of the Tulsa youth while on his way to work.  He must have been
in a hurry, because when we tried to feed him, he wouldn&rsquo;t eat
anything, and shortly he drove away very fast.  He didn&rsquo;t even stick
around long enough to meet Dave, but that was OK because Dave has a
lot of friends anyway.</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>

<p>After the Love Feast by some chance I didn&rsquo;t have to clean up, so I
went back inside and hung out in the sponge room.  Stevie Williams
gave me a wonderful picture of Dave she had drawn, which he will
cherish forever, so I asked her to draw one on the wall for everyone
else to remember him by.  I didn&rsquo;t try very hard to stay awake that
night, and I went to sleep after a while on one of the couches.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>When I woke up in the morning the lights in the sponge room were off
and I was being tormented by really terrible stomach pains, probably
because of a tray full of chocolate chips that Nick Grunewald had
poured down my gullet at the Love Feast the night before.  Before
long I was talkin&rsquo; to Ralph on the big white telephone.  After having
four distinct conversations, I clunked heavily back into the Sponge
Room, where people were now moving around getting ready, and
collapsed on the floor. Though I had bowed faithfully to the
porcelain god he had not answered my prayers and I was still very
sore.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>While I was lying on the floor in the sponge room, Jon
Witten-Lege informed me of my somnambulist activities the
night before.  According to him, I had gotten up from where I was
lying on the couch and mumbled some indecipherable sounds.  I had
walked over to where the couch right beneath the bulletin board that
said &ldquo;The Sponge Room&rdquo; sat and molested the feet of the person who
was sleeping there (I think it was Frank Roessler), possibly as an
indulgence of my foot fetish.  Then I had walked over to Jon and
mumbled some more gibberish (now that I think about it I was probably
trying to say something like, &ldquo;Ouch, my stomach&rdquo;).  He had tried in
vain to communicate with me, and then he had asked me, &ldquo;Dane, are you
asleep?&ldquo;, and I had said, &ldquo;Yyyyyeeeeeeessssss&rdquo;.  Then I had gone back
to my couch and lain down again.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>Eventually I had to get my stuff and move out to the
hallway in front of the door, because the Sponge Room was being
cleaned and it was raining outside.  I almost hurt too bad to move,
but it was fun watching while other people scurried around cleaning.<br />
I fell asleep for a little while and when I woke up I was feeling
significantly better, although whatever it was that I had is still
bothering me a little as I write this.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>Breakfast was bagels and juice, served right before closing circle.<br />
There were six seniors at the rally, and they formed a circle in the
middle and started a not-too-enthusiastic round of Good Friends,
which the rest of us joined in on.  While it was going they faced
outwards and we all did a spiral hug around them.  Then we let them
out and did the usual emotional goodbye.  Mugbooks were not given out
at the rally, because the film hadn&rsquo;t been developed in time, so they
will be mailed out later, which is something I&rsquo;ve heard about but
never experienced in two years of rally life.  So goodbye guys, love
ya, see you in New Orleans.
</p>
<p>
Yo,
Dane and Dave</p>

                        <h1>1997 Fort Worth rally review by Rob</h1>

<hr>

<p>Driving up from Houston in my truck were just Cathy Saur and
myself.<br>
The entire way up there we talked about what is most important
in the world.  The discussion resulted
in us defining 4 types of love:<p>
<ol>
<li> Love, the emotion, that people have when they fall in love
with other people.  This is the type of love people usually mean
 when they say, &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</li>
<li> Love, the non-love, when people love things that are
inanimate.  &ldquo;I love that dress!&rdquo;  &ldquo;I love that picture!&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I love to ski.&rdquo;</li>
<li> Love, the instinct, which all humans intrinsically have for
 all other humans.</li>
<li> And Rally Love, that amazing thing that allows us to form
greater relationships in one weekend than in a whole semester in school.   Incredible!</li>
</ol>
I believe the most important thing in the world is to love yourself and everyone else, and I think the
perfect life for me would be to &ldquo;walk the earth&rdquo; like Jules in Pulp Fiction and love so many people that I wouldn&rsquo;t need money to live- just be a bum, but not begging for money, just being helpful and
getting a place to sleep in return.      <br>
Really.  That would be cool.<p>
We drove the entire way nonstop once we got out of Houston rush hour traffic.<p>
Walked into the rally and upon seeing my short short haircut (1/8th inch all over), James Meine said,
&ldquo;can I lick it?&rdquo;   I said sure&hellip;.  Rally Love.<p>
We played hackysack &amp; skateboarded around the big flat hard concrete sanctuary, after playing with a weird plus-shape green flying foam thing until one of its arms was ripped off.   I got out my Ballzack, basically a big cloth beach ball.  We knocked it around for quite a while and soon developed a game we called Deadball.  Essentially the same rules as Ultimate.  We played that until dog tired 5:30AM and I lay down and slept about 30 minutes in the movie room, where they were watching <em>Holy Grail</em>.  I got back up and played hackysack with the few remaining players.  I did better than usual, though we were all obviously tired.  We played Deadball again as the sun was coming up.  At 7AM or so I slept 2 hours until breakfast at 9.<p>
Adam Lock and I went outside and tossed the frisbee around and practiced various types of throws.  After a couple other people came out, I went in to check the schedule and talked to Bernest Cain, Melissa&rsquo;s dad, and then went to the Sexuality Workshop.
The workshop was cool; I learned that babies must be lovingly touched or they will die.  Wow.<p>
During lunch I sat with Gabe Rendon and Mike Noyse and asked them about Wu-Tang Clan, to understand what/why/whatever about the &ldquo;lyrics&rdquo; describing graphic ways of torturing people.  I decided that it can be seen as a form of humor in that it&rsquo;s exaggerating stupid hurtful thing people have done.  And as a game to see who can gross the other out.   hmm.<p>
After that, we got a group together and played Ultimate out in the field.  It was super great fun.  I hope the youth had as much fun as I.  The game ended as PM workshops started.<p>   I attended the workshop that showed the <em>Powers of Ten</em> video and then had discussion afterward.  Great discussion afterward about &ldquo;what kind of a difference can we make at this particular magnitude of life?&rdquo; and  &ldquo;why life anyway?&rdquo;  or &ldquo;why sentience and self awarness?&rdquo; and we talked about the structure of the universe.  Pretty interesting stuff.     I described briefly the experiences of one man who has had 2 near death experiences, and how he believes the most important thing in the world is for each individual to be responsible for his or her own actions.<p>
Soon after the workshop, I described to Gavin, et. al. the flatland universe big bang, and how the book <em>Stalking the Wild Pendulum</em> described the universe as continuously big banging and continuously big crunching.  (Don&rsquo;t worry; it didn&rsquo;t make any more sense when I described it than as I&rsquo;m typing it here.)<p>
Then we cut about 4 variations of mobius strips with <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>, 1, and 1&amp;<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> twists.  Cool.<p>
I talked to Aisha, who has been to 9 SWUUSIs but this was her first rally.  She said she felt a bit out of place, so I asked if she would play a game if I got one started.  She would, so I did.<br>
We played the Zoo Game and it degenerated to a slow motion version  of the game with people all playing really slowly, taunting the other players and making the game suck.  I singled out 1 person as slowness instigator and I asked him privately to play more enthusiastically- to actually run and try to play&hellip;  He did better and that helped but people were still playing apathetically&hellip;<p>
My belief is that by playing enthusiastically, the game thrives; it becomes more enjoyable for all involved.  By playing the other way, people were actually sucking energy out of the game and out of the other players (read <em>Celestine Prophecy</em> to see what I&rsquo;m talking about).<p>
Unfortunately, the only way I knew to explain this was to adamantly tell people &ldquo;play better, play harder blah blah blah&rdquo; and then (more unfortunate) for me to RUN and play to the point it was too hard for some players, and made at least one not want to play.   This was not working out at all and I didn&rsquo;t know what to do.    Fortunately, &ldquo;dinner is ready!&rdquo; was shouted into the room, and everyone vanished, except for me; I collapsed onto the comforting cold concrete floor to recover some energy.<p>
In the dinner line, I asked a few people if I played too hard.<br />
I had, so next time we play, I will explain logically why we
might want to play passionately instead of otherwise.<br />
(Zoo Gamers, be ready!)<p>
During dinner we had the YAC candidates run for election and I
ran for the adult position, and I got it!  My term officially
starts at SWUUSI this year.  Yayyy!!<p>
After dinner I talked with other adults who had congregated at
one table and told them about the web page, and we brainstormed
stuff to put on it.<p>
Then we had the dance, then the YAC transfer of
power/description of accomplishments meeting, then the talent
show<p>
Much to my pleasant surprise, when I jokingly started the talent show with the Fuck You Clown Joke, everyone was like, &ldquo;yeah yeah!! tell it!&rdquo;   So I did.  Tera Little apparently hadn&rsquo;t heard it before and said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s <em>terrible</em>!&rdquo; when I sat down.<p>
Then Kristian Scott, Dane Dormio, and I performed &ldquo;Dead Puppies.&rdquo;
  Dane sang, Kristian fingered the chords on the guitar, and I
strummed the guitar and laughed because it truly was terrible.<br />
We had great fun, though.<p>
Then Gabe Rendon and Mike Noyse performed with Gabe doing beat
box and Mike rapping and I was envious at how well Gabe can
beatbox and I could practically hear the deep mega low ultra
bass woofers and hear and see the scratch as they danced around
the stage and performed so passionately loving and beautifully
ad libbed the whole thing!  How do they do it???  I would pay 50
bucks to have it on tape.
(Gabe, Mike, you listenin?)<p>
Then I fell asleep.<p>
Then my first YAC meeting as a YAC member and we decided what
positions people will have and what overall goals we have for
YAC this year.<p>
Then Silent Football until 2am or so.  How nice it was to sit
by Carina Dormio and play nicely instead of always play fighting
as we had done in the past.<p>
Then Tera Little and I stayed up until 4AM yackin&rsquo; about life,
love and everything.   Julie Sexton sat with us, until I was
literally falling asleep while sitting up.  Time for bed.<p>
Slept until around 7am when the funniest thing was hearing Debe
Barnes holler in her sleepy voice to someone trying to wake us
up, &ldquo;is it clean yet??  Don&rsquo;t wake me up until the church is
clean!&rdquo;  That was hilarious.<p>
That morning, I realized that Shawn McDaniel, who went to
rallies with me back in the good ol&rsquo; days, had been there the
whole weekend knowing it was me and just waiting for me to
realize it.  Wow!!  We swapped emails and reminisced and it was
great.  <p>
I took a long time hugging everyone, and especially all the
seniors as everybody was leaving.  I will miss them all.  <p>
Drove home and Cathy slept the entire way.  I slept for 30
minutes after we arrived at the church until her parents got
there and knocked on the truck window.  Got home and slept.<p>
Great rally.<p>
With Love<br>
Rob</p>

                        <h1>1997 Ft Worth rally review by Dane Dormio</h1>

<hr>

<p>Ft. Worth, rally number eleven for me, and the last one for a lot of
seniors.  This fact perhaps made it a little more emotional than
most.  At the end, though, I was surprised that almost nobody cried.<br />
Last year, I remember, there was a lot of crying at the end.  I was
told that by the time it&rsquo;s time for seniors to leave, they are about
ready to move on anyway.  I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s true, but I&rsquo;m also sure it
is still not easy, and I definitely don&rsquo;t look forward to it.  I
think this was a good last rally, because it had so many memorable
events.  There were no wall incidents, but hey, it&rsquo;s the small things
that count.  Things like the few hours during the day that the power
went out, and the cotton down that was constantly floating around in
the air and depositing itself in places, and the wet, sandy mud on
the playground that felt wonderful on bare feet, and yes, even the
toilet in the little boys room that overflowed and the water that
spilled out into the lobby and down the ramp into the dining room.  I
hope my last rally is as nice.  At night it was cool, but not as cold
as OKC, but during the day it was sunny bright and just warm enough.
<p>
The drive was about eight hours, relatively short for us.  The usual
four from Jonesboro, Arlene, Carina, Aaron, and myself, went, as well
as Greg Williams, a guy from our fellowship, who went as an advisor.
Four weeks seemed like a long time to wait for a rally, and I was
fully ready by the time I arrived.  I hopped out of the car and
walked inside.  I signed in and was immediately greeted
enthusiastically by Rob.  (Boy, it&rsquo;s great to finally be here.  Hey,
somebody&rsquo;s charging at me.  Oh my god, it&rsquo;s Rob.  Oh my god, he&rsquo;s
bald!  Harruuumph!  Hi, Rob.)  The greetings were as exciting and
emotional as always.  I greeted everybody and checked out the
church. It was a nice place for a rally.  They hadn&rsquo;t had one in
about three years, the Duck rally, hence the name of this one, &ldquo;Son
of Duck.&rdquo;  There was a white porcelain duck on a table with markers
for people to decorate and memorabiliaize at their leisure.  Now that
I think about it, it was a minor miracle that it did not get broken.<br />
<p>
Opening Circle happened, with a rubber duckie tossed around and duck
stories shared.  The idea was to share happy stories, but the
majority of the stories told were about ducks or ducklings getting
squashed, stepped on, eaten, incinerated, falling through sewer
grates, etc.  Then afterwards touch group meetings.  I don&rsquo;t know
about the others, but mine was pretty good.  There were a lot of good
getting-to-know-each-other questions.
<p>
The first night rolled steadily on with all the usual buzzing energy:
bouncing music and Ballzacks, the Zoo game, the invention of
Deadball, a floppy boomerang being chased, and general Tiggerish
behavior.  I decided to be a wimp and laid down to watch
&ldquo;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Crow&rdquo;.  I fell asleep for
a few hours before morning.
<p>
Breakfast was the usual, cereal and milk.  The newly-risen sun was
beautiful, drying up the dewy grass and warming the sidewalks,
accompanied by pleasant birdsongs.  When morning workshop time rolled
around, I was in the movie room and since the workshop was going to
be about sexuality, I decided to stay where I was.  It was a great
workshop, put on by a woman whom I later found out was Gary Randall&rsquo;s
girlfriend.  The first thing we did was hold up various pictures and
decide how sexual they were.  It turned out, of course, that they
were all sexual, because all people are sexual.  It was a very
informative and enlightening workshop, and I learned a little more
about what it means to be a human being.  When it was over the woman
who put it on gave me a special hug and told me I had a wonderful
mind and heart, and she wanted me to know that.  Then I picked
Nick G. up and exposed his rear for free smacks, which he got a lot
of, because he had been making bad jokes the whole time.
<p>
At lunch they served sandwiches.  I fixed a couple, then sat down and
helped put together a jigsaw puzzle.
<p>
Sometime during the day, I got around to walking back out the front
door and realized something I hadn&rsquo;t in the dark:  the cotton down
that had settled all around the front door resembled duck down, which
went along perfectly with the theme of the rally.  As the day grew
older a game of ultimate frisbee started on the big grassy field, but
I did&rsquo;t participate because I didn&rsquo;t want to run around in the sun
and get all hot and smelly.  Instead I walked across to the
playground and pulled my pants up to walk around in the puddles of
water.  I swung in the tire swing, climbed the swingset, and pushed
Emily sessions and Karen Plemons around on the merry-go-round.
<p>
I was walking back to the church and saw Kitty and Ben sitting lazily
under a tree doing nothing, so I decided to help them.  The three of
us sat on a sleeping bag for at least an hour, partaking of nature.<br />
In such a manner the afternoon passed, and the afternoon workshops
came and went.  I went back to the church eventually and hung around
for a bit, then eventually wandered back to the playground before
the day was over.
<p>
Some other things I did during that day were learn how to play
deadball, sit and have a serious talk with Brian, sit and have a
serious talk with Tia, sit and have a serious talk with Anna, and I
started to mosh to &ldquo;Antichrist Superstar&rdquo; with a few other Manson
fans, but apparently even the power company dislikes Marilyn Manson,
because shortly after the CD started the power surged for a while and
then went out.  Somebody started a rumor that a squirrel had touched
two power lines and caused the surge, and Laura Moriaty spread it, so
a mob of people went outside expecting to see a fried squirrel
hanging from the power lines, only to be disappointed when they found
out that it was just a blown transformer.  The bathrooms didn&rsquo;t have
any windows, so candles were used for them, but the power came back
on before it started to get dark.
<p>
The main attraction for the evening for several people involved a
tube of blue icing that Nick G. had found earlier.  He got a group of
people together to PHUUF my sister and smeared the blue icing all
over my face.  After a little bit of &ldquo;heavy persuasion&rdquo; we got my
sister to acquiesce, and I PHUUFed her, making sure to get the icing
in good.  Then anyone who wanted to lick it off of her got a chance.<br />
I&rsquo;m sure this was just great for my sister, who had been PHUUFED in
as many ways as are conceivable already by James and Chris.  Then,
when I went into the bathroom to wash my face off, I found a flaw in
Nick&rsquo;s plan:  blue icing STAINS YOUR FACE BLUE.  It was alright,
though, it was pretty freaky looking.
<p>
Dinner was lasagna and French bread, like at OKC, but with cookies
for desert instead of brownies.  During dinner we watched the runners
for YAC give their &ldquo;elect me&rdquo; speeches.  The ones who ran were Jeremy
Loomis-Nooris, Austin Roth, Aaron Ivener, and Rob.  After that, of
course, elections.  Then touch group meetings, for which we were
supposed to get something done, but my group must have missed
something, because we didn&rsquo;t do anything at all.
<p>
At eight o&rsquo;clock, after the touch group meetings, I went into the
movie room and laid down and watched &ldquo;The Crow&rdquo; again, because I had
missed most of it last night due to being asleep.  There was
supposed to be a dance going on in the big room, and every once in a
while someone would come in and say, &ldquo;Come on guys, come dance!&rdquo;, or
something like that.  So eventually, I got up and went into the big
room and guess what:  nobody was dancing.  So everybody just hung out
in there and eventually the dance turned into speeches by the
important people, something about YAC or the bylaws and the rally
sanctioning laws, or something serious like that.  I didn&rsquo;t pay too
much attention, being busy fighting off sleep instead.
<p>
Eventually that ended and turned into a talent show, which I sat in
on but did not pay a whole lot of attention to, except when I
was requested to sing &ldquo;Dead Puppies&rdquo;, partly because of tiredness,
but later because Jessica Ford and I were busy trading back rubs.<br />
She did me, then I did her, and I had to top her back rub, so I
did her hands, arms, and feet too, so I took a lot longer.  I missed
two consecutive games of silent football in such a manner, as well as
a batch of groovy juice.  We paused shortly, though, to dance around
doing &ldquo;tu lakazia, nali pasa caya&rdquo; (spelled phonetically), for the
worship service.  I was so tired that I actually fell asleep a few
times while sitting up massaging her feet.  It was weird, I was aware
of what I was doing with my hands, but not of anything else.  A
strange ASC.  I eventually quit and walked around inside and out for
a while, trying to stay awake for a little while longer so I could
partake of a superior batch of groovy juice promised by Garrick and
Charles Misner, occasionally snacking on the Oreos that were set out.
<p>
I was overcome by sleep, however, before I could ever get so much as
a whiff of the superior batch.  I&rsquo;m not even sure if it ever
happened.  I was laying on the floor and sometime during my short
sleep I grabbed Garrick&rsquo;s overcoat and pulled it on top of me to
cover up with.  Something vibrating and buzzing in one of the pockets
woke me up with a start, and I got up shortly after that.
<p>
When I got up it was before six, but wake-up was not until seven,
so there was a while to wait before I could have my fun.  Linda
actually started waking people up at six forty-five, because once
they were up and looked at the schedule, it didn&rsquo;t matter if they
were pissed anyway.  I went around and did my share of the waking-up.
<p>
Clean up passed quickly, because I sat and snuggled with Anna the
whole time (don&rsquo;t worry, I don&rsquo;t usually shirk my duties).  Breakfast
was doughnuts, different kinds than just glazed, which is always
good.  Then closing circle out in the middle of the field.<br />
Bish-bish, yogi bear, the beaver song, I don&rsquo;t remember what else,
excellent mugbooks, and a senior circle.  A last minute plan of Nick
Devereaux&rsquo;s, the seniors all ran at Nick Grunewald and swept him up
and gang PHUUFed him before he ever knew what was happening.  I know
it just made his rally.
<p></p>

<p>Emotional goodbyes, a few teary ones, but people were alright.<br />
The advisors decided that the youth weren&rsquo;t getting out of the
church fast enough, so Rob and Debbie shoved everyone out the
door in an irresistible clump of bodies.  When I finally got finished
saying goodbye to all my friends, I decided to ride with Little Rock
to their church and then the rest of the way home with the rest of
the Jonesboroites.  The first few hours in the van with Little Rock
were pretty boring, but during the second half of the trip I taught
them all how to play Silent Football.  I was, of course, the
dictator, and they were all new, except for Nick G., who had played
the night before.  It took about an hour and half or so to get
everyone familiar with the rules, and then at least that long to play
a game.  It was a really good game, though, for being played in a
moving van with a bunch of beginners.  Nick G. lost, and for penance
everyone got to comb his hair, something he hates.

<p>And then we got to the church, I said goodbye, then I went home and
lived happily ever after.<br />

                        <h1> OKC RALLY   11-13 APRIL 1997 </h1>

<p><p>
What a drive!  I thought it was like 10 hours, so psychologically I made it
longer than it actually was- only 7.    Wende, co-advisor with me at Emerson
UU in Houston and I drove, while quietly talking or sleeping in the back were
Cathy Saur and Ben Atkinson.
<p>
Got there about 1:30 in the AM and had apparently just missed opening circle.
Lots of hugs all around, while a soap bubble gun blew big soap bubbles, music
bounced between Beastie Boys, Nine Inch Nails, and Po Tang (what is it???)&hellip;.
I got to play Pente with Karla Gilmore, which was super fun, considering I had
only met her over email, and we had already played a few games over email.  We
both won a couple of games.
<p>
Several youth and I played circle tag, where you stand in a vaguely tight
circle and touch someone, &ldquo;tag you&rsquo;re it&rdquo; and basically just tag the next
person if you get tagged.  You&rsquo;re not allowed to move your feet.  The fun thing
is when people think you&rsquo;re having a really cool discussion, and they walk up
and immediately get tagged.<br />
<p>
Also the first night we played about 4 rounds of Sardines!  Many of the doors
were locked (more than last year) so there were fewer places to hide.  First
Mike Moren hid downstairs by the utility room sink.  We sardines waited for a
while &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give them until 5:30PM tomorrow before we get up!&rdquo; but then found
out that the remaining players had quit to watch a movie.  <br>
Then Nick Carter was caught while trying to hide in a cabinet in the upstairs
kitchen.  <br>
Then Bryan Beck and Ashley Robinson hid by simply sitting in a back corner of
the main kitchen.  I found them first, and talked to Bryan about setting up a
homepage for SWD YRUU to replace Jamie Willis-Rose&rsquo; page which has great
information, but is slightly out of date.   Bryan seemed pretty keen on the
idea, so we decided to do it.<br>
Once we were found, I hid by squishing myself into a lower shelf in the
downstairs junk room, which was really cleaned out compared to last year.
<p>
I don&rsquo;t remember much else from the first night.
<p>
I slept about 45 minutes then got up and had breakfast (2 bowls of Captain
Crunch).
<p>
I went to the tie dye workshop, where I tie dyed my extra Houston Rally
t-shirt, a pair of Julie Sexton&rsquo;s socks, and Charlotte Benbeneck-Price&rsquo;s
bleached blonde hair.
<p>
Played Pente with several people through lunch, big giant Subway Sandwiches.<br />
Yummmmy.
<p>
The collage workshop was cool- we ripped out cool pictures from magazines and
glued &lsquo;em down.  I found big lipstick red lips that look quite reminiscent of
the Rocky Horror lips, and converted the words &ldquo;GOING BROKE&rdquo; and the title of
&ldquo;People&rdquo; magazine into &ldquo;OK GO Pee&rdquo;
<p>
Then I slept for about 3 hours.
<p>
Dinner and contra dancing kicked off the evening.  I really enjoyed the
dancing, much to my surprise.   And it was <em>tiring</em>!!
<p>
After that, several people played another round of circle tag, which turned
into a game of crab tag, where we were all doing crab walk scuttling around
the room tagging people.  Frank Roeslor evolved into a screeching howler monkey
galloping around on all fours.  Crab tag is pretty hard on the arms, so we
played Elbow Tag, or Link, as I remembered it being called on YRUU-L.  I had
never played before, so I just made up the rules from how I figured they should
be.  It was great fun.  Somewhere in there we played the Zoo Game (taught to us
by Stacey Hendren at Dallas Rally in February (it&rsquo;s a variation of the game
called Fruit, except it doesn&rsquo;t use a pillow).  I was Kangaroo, Keith Lawlor
was giraffe, Nick Carter was Heat Seeking Worm (or something), Kitty Rankin
was cat, Ben Muller was wolf, Tiffany Schneider was pig, Meagan Holt was
chicken, Frank(?) was zebra, Caroline Barr was her sister..  I don&rsquo;t remember
any others.
<p>
During the talent show, Karla Gilmore and I performed an ad lib version of
&ldquo;Fifty Things to do Besides Watch TV&rdquo;  That was fun.
<p>
Nick Carter and I sang to the tune of &ldquo;a few of my favorite things&rdquo;
&ldquo;These are what made OKC Rally dear,&rdquo; which is written on page 5 of Volume 1 of
The Big White Rally Book.
<p>
Mike Noyes performed a rap on the fly, with Curtis MacCormick on drum, and 3
backup rappers (I only remember for sure Samantha Nagel saying &ldquo;Ice Ice Baby&rdquo;)
<p>
Steve Feinstein played guitar and sang Dead Puppies&hellip;..Dead Puppies&hellip;.
and performed 2 songs (by Simon and Garfunkel??) with Bryan Beck.  Really nice.
<p>
Cathy Saur read a story she had written which really wrenched some emotion out
of me.  You had to be there.
<p>
Samantha Nagel did a dancing lip synch to Michael Jackson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Billie Jean&rdquo; with
Ethan Fowler and Elliot Tracy as backup dancers.  They were funny.
<p>
Lots more performances, but I don&rsquo;t remember them all for sure.
<p>
After the talent show was worship, consisting mainly of ceremonial foot
washing, hosted by Austin Roth.<br />
<p>
After that, Rocky Horror Picture Show was in the basement, while some youth
danced in the main hall, while I played Silent Football with several people
upstairs in the worship room.  Silent Football was great.  We played from
3am until Nick Carter, as the dictator was beginning to fall asleep at
&ldquo;oh shit 5:30&rdquo;
<p>
We slept.<br />
<p>
Then, an hour later than planned, Debe came running through the rooms with her
whistle, &ldquo;WAKE UP!! WAKE UP!!!  We only have 1 hour to be cleaned up!!!!&rdquo;
We woke up.  We cleaned up.  We did it.   I think we should try to clean up
in just 45 minutes next rally.
<p>
Closing circle was brief.  Yogi Bear, The Beaver Song, Good Friends, and
2 seniors in the center said goodbye for Karla and Heidi, who had to leave
at 5am.  Mugbooks, donuts, and see ya in Fort Worth!!</p>

<p><p>With Love
<br>Rob</p>
