<p><p>Awesome!</p>

<p><p>Some days ago, my friend Brian called me to see if I was interested, or if I knew of anyone who might be interested, in replacing him in his current job.</p>

<p><p>He described the requirements and stuff, and at first I was like, um um..  maybe but probably not.  In continuing to talk with him, that thinking shifted to more like, maybe yes!</p>

<p><p>I went to visit the place (5 minutes from my house) on Wednesday afternoon for a preliminary interview. I enjoyed the whole atmosphere of the place: friendly people wearing casual clothing in a homey environment.  Posters on the walls, pictures of kids, a bucket of Super Bubble gum on the table..  Definitely my kind of place!  I met Carla the president of the company who queried me about my background and interests and everything.  We were both enthusiastic at the end of that interview.  I still needed to meet with Kevin, who wasn&rsquo;t there at the time.</p>

<p><p>Met with Kevin and Carla today and everything is super double plus good, but from their point of view, almost too good. They haven&rsquo;t interviewed anyone else, or even looked for anyone else.  Brian gave his one month notice, called me and I was there the next day.</p>

<p><p>So Kevin and Carla will talk about it over lunch, and I&rsquo;m here chillin&rsquo; at home happily expecting the best.</p>

                        <p class=date>20 August 1999</p>

<p><p>Last night was Thursday, so I went skating. No one else was in our designated parking lot at 8pm, so I sat in Scott&rsquo;s open trunk writing in my diary for a few moments. I was literally ready to leave at 8:09 when two people arrived at the same moment.</p>

<p><p>We got our skates on and we headed toward downtown.  I love skating through downtown.  The construction, the traffic, the unlimited space, steps, curbs; all the things that are unlike a skating rink, I love.</p>

<p><p>One big thing we were unlikely to find in a skating rink is the new baseball stadium.  It spans 4 city blocks and resembles an enormous Erector Set construction (I&rsquo;m showing my age) with bold uncovered metal girders and beams.  The most amazing thing about it: the roof is like a sunroof!  The whole huge thing is on wheels and can be retracted!  I guess it&rsquo;s more like a convertable because the entire top half of the stadium can roll to one side.  Unlike a convertable, it doesn&rsquo;t fold up and hide underneath a fabric or leather cover, but it&rsquo;s still super impressive.  When I exclaimed, &ldquo;holy shit are those wheels???&rdquo;  Kim and David were like, &ldquo;yeah; where have you been?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Toward George R. Brown Convention Center we skated, and oh-my-gosh those are grandstands - giant sets of bleachers have been set up for the race car thing.  Is it Stock Car? Nascar? Obviously I don&rsquo;t pay much attention to it, but I certainly enjoyed skating along the super smooth asphalt in front of thousands of cheering ghost spectators.</p>

<p><p>Then to some biker bar with hundreds of sparkling hogs and cycles out front and hundreds of boistrous bearded tattooed bikers inside.  Just like in the movies, except right in my downtown!  We spent several minutes ogling the bikes; Kim and David had much more apparent knowledge about them than I.</p>

<p><p>Then we embarked on the trek toward the museum district (a tad over 1 mile I&rsquo;m guessing) and I showed them my footprint in the concrete at the Children&rsquo;s Museum!  They, properly impressed, and I, pleased as punch, skated on and noticed a pile of well dressed people in the new(?) Health Museum. We paused to people watch for a bit and then got kicked off the property by a cop.</p>

<p><p>Toward home we skated, until I saw two skaters up ahead.  &ldquo;Bye!&rdquo; to Kim and David and caught up with two people who turned out to be named Mike and Mike, respectively.</p>

<p><p>To the hill at Miller Outdoor Theater we skated.  I trudged up and flew down the hill and then joined them chilling on a wall.  Mike was waxing up an edge of the wall to do some grinds.</p>

<p><p>I didn&rsquo;t feel too super comfortable being around them grinding (it marks up the walls and is certainly frowned upon by many people, especially those who own the wall) so I announced my departure and they ended up going with me. We trudged up and zipped down the hill and then toward headed toward the zoo.</p>

<p><p>The trek toward the zoo is short and dark and rather dangerous as the sidewalk crosses the miniature park railroad tracks twice, and may (or may not) be strewn with random sticks or pine cones.  Plus it twists and turns through the trees and I found it difficult to always see which way I needed to turn at a given moment.  Oh, and there are park benches occassionally along the edge, which would certainly inflict bodily damage if encountered at 15 miles per hour.</p>

<p><p>Speeding through this twisty path, I made it successfully through the first grove of trees, including across the tracks twice.  Then surprised a couple smooching on a park bench as I hauled by with a friendly &ldquo;hi,&rdquo; and then gone again into the second set of trees.  Again no problem and then up and over the wooden foot-bridge over a tiny portion of the lake.</p>

<p><p>Ahh&hellip;  yes!  made it without crashing!  I paused for a second to let them catch up.  Mike got there first, and then Mike was close behind.</p>

<p><p>We skated around to the other side of the lake in search of a water fountain.  Found it, slurped water, rested and talked.</p>

<p><p>Turns out Mike is a traveler; he&rsquo;s moved about a million times in the past several years of his life.  Part of me is envious, but I asked my higher self what would fit in my life in this arena.  The answer came back something like, &ldquo;I can take little road trips with my skates and frisbee and digital camera and laptop computer and travel and skate and meet people and see cool things or whatever and archive them here on my website.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Nice.</p>

<p><p>I gave Mike and Mike my cards (I often carry them when I skate) and we began a trek toward home.</p>

<p><p>Along McGregor we skated on the sidewalk and whoah deja-vu as we quickly reached where the sidewalk ends and I barely slowed enough to not crash when I hit the sand.  Mike and Mike were a tad behind me; they also didn&rsquo;t crash.</p>

<p><p>Then to Main Street, we turned right and skated facing traffic in the far left lane (left according to us; right lane according to the oncoming traffic) so we could see any cars before they squished us.</p>

<p><p>Mike and Mike turned left onto Sunset Blvd to go wherever they went, and I continued my trek home. Got honked at once, but didn&rsquo;t come close to crashing at all.  Zipped across Westheimer at Montrose as the light had just turned perfectly green for me, I jumped onto the sidewalk, down the curb into the intersection, right in front of cars waiting for their green light, up the next curb and gone.  I love that.</p>

<p><p>I was glad to find my car at Texas Art Supply where I had left it; I was tired and that shaved 200 yards off the distance I had to skate.</p>

<p><p>Home at about 11:30pm.</p>

<p><p>Today I have jury duty.  The summons came by mail to my apartment while I was in Iowa.  When I saw the summons, I was like, &ldquo;uh oh- I hope I didn&rsquo;t miss it!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I didn&rsquo;t miss it.  But I did miss the fact that I am scheduled for KTRU on the same day.  Doh!  I caught this too late and requested a sub only a couple days ago.  I dunno what&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>

<p><p>Maybe the station will be off the air for 3 hours.  Maybe I can shout, &ldquo;guilty!&rdquo; and be removed from the case.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ll try to call some DJs today at a more decent hour.</p>

<p class=date>11:45pm Tuesday 17 August 1999</p>

<p><p>Skated from TX art Supply down to Herrman Park around by medical center around rice University.  Oh- I zipped down the hill by Miller Outdoor Theater twice and around Rice and got ice cream at Walgreens in Rice Village area. and I met Gwen and Kelly and Darwin (&ldquo;Like Charles&rdquo;) and Roberta and then skated back toward my house along Hazard hauling ass and <font size="+1">BLUH LAM</font> I hit sand and my skates stopped and I fell <em>bang</em> on the sandy asphalt almost into a parked car.  Ow knocked the wind outta me and I rested for a sec.  Jeff waited there with me as others continued on (with my frisbee that I dropped in the process).  Caught up with the group and got my disk and said bye and broke off to say HI to Jennifer at The Mad Potter.  Chilled and talk talked about her life a lot and she invited me to go swim at her house.  Yes.</p>

<p><p>Swim was fun, watched Tarantula the kitten cutely play in the living room, climbing all over the couches.  Hugged and I went home.</p>

                        <p class=date>Saturday 14 August 1999</p>

<p><p>After having been up until 3am last night, I was sleeping soundly at 8am when Jason called.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up honky?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yo Jason, what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You wanna go water skiing with us today?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What? Water skiing? Um, yeah what time?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You gotta be at my house by 9 o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Um, okay, it&rsquo;s what 7am now?&rdquo;  I had thought my clock said 7.  It felt like 7.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s 8.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;uh oh. okay bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Got to his house at 8:59am.</p>

<p><p>His friends Chris and Tammy were there, and his sister Tana. We piled into my car and Tammy&rsquo;s car and stopped by Albertson&rsquo;s for ice, water, and sunscreen.</p>

<p><p>Sara works at Albertson&rsquo;s and she surprised me with a surprised, &ldquo;hi Rob!&rdquo; as I walked by.  Wow!  No time to talk now, but I gave her a hug and we zipped off to the boat rental place.</p>

<p><p>Jason&rsquo;s mom was there and we got the boat and all that.</p>

<p><p>Skiing was awesome.  I haven&rsquo;t been in at least 10 years.  I think the last time I went was at SWUUSI, when I ended up with 4 stitches below my eye when a ski popped me in the face as I fell.  I&rsquo;ve been snow skiing since then, and there&rsquo;s a nagging feeling that I&rsquo;ve been water skiing since then, but I can&rsquo;t remember when so I say I haven&rsquo;t been.   In either case, it&rsquo;s been a long time.</p>

<p><p>Jason went first; it was his birthday (the reason we were skiing at all) and he slalomed.  He got up on the first try and skied for a pretty long time, although he didn&rsquo;t do many tricks or anything.</p>

<p><p>Chris went next and got up on the first time using both skis.</p>

<p><p>When I went, I tried one ski several times, but couldn&rsquo;t ever get up out of the water!  Doh!  So I put on both skis and had no problem.  I loved zipping way outside the boat on turns, skimming across the water at super ultra jet speed.  I tried a couple of tricks: letting my butt touch the water, picking up one ski, jumping over the wake (actually the boat we used wasn&rsquo;t that big so the wake was not much to jump), oh, and I straddled a little styrofoam bouy thing along the edge of the lake.</p>

<p><p>That reminds me- the lake water was gross.  Not super deep, and stinky silty mud at the bottom that our feet just glooped right through while walking.  I used the skis as &ldquo;snow shoes&rdquo; or silt shoes in this case when I fell and was waiting for the boat to get back to me.</p>

<p><p>That also reminds me.  Each time I fell, if I was really going to wipe out well, I would cover my face and head with my arms to protect from any torpedo-like skis that might otherwise send me to the ER.  I never once got hit by a ski though, so I remained unscathed.  One time when I fell, I didn&rsquo;t really fall at first; I was about to eat-it, so I let go of the rope and just slowed to a halt and kinda tumped into the water.  Very smooth fall.</p>

<p><p>A different time I fell in the middle of a super way outside the boat turn thing and couldn&rsquo;t handle the oncoming waves as hard as I was pulling out, plus my arms and legs were so fatigued from skiing!  That was about the wildest crash I had, kinda twisted into the water and covered my head for protection.</p>

<p><p>The second time out of the boat, I tried one ski again.  With much encouragement from all aboard the boat, I was finally able to do it!!  It just required encouragement and a fine control of how steep to angle the ski out of the water to get me onto it.  Once I was up on one ski, it was relatively easy, especially with all the cheers from the boat for my success!  I barely jumped the little wake and swung outside the boat when I could.  Great great fun.</p>

<p><p>Tana, Tammy and Jason&rsquo;s mom all chose not to ski, though they all did get into the water once to cool off, amidst lots of &ldquo;gross!!! it&rsquo;s so gross!&rdquo; cries from Tana and Tammy.  The sun was baking hot on all of us and we drank lots of water.  I had one SPF 30 sunscreen and still got a little burned on my shoulders.</p>

<p><p>Mom treated us all to lunch at Mannie&rsquo;s and it was great!  I had chicen, spinach, cheese quesedillas.  Even had some leftover for breakfast.</p>

<p><p><hr align="left" width="20%"></p>

<p><p>We all parted ways and I swung by Albertson&rsquo;s to see if Sara was still there.  She was but had just finished lunch so couldn&rsquo;t talk super long.  She invited me to watch her get a tattoo tonight.  Sounded cool to me so we set up a general time and I went home.</p>

<p><p>I slept.</p>

<p><p>Sara came over, we went to the tattoo place and she spent several minutes deciding what to get.  She had had a firm decision made that morning, but wasn&rsquo;t so determined this evening.  She decided upon a yin yang symbol with fire burning up from it and the initials AH for American Humanics, an organization she volunteers and works for at University of Houston.</p>

<p><p>She dropped me off back at home and here I am.  I&rsquo;m going to bed.</p>

                        <p class=date>Friday 13 August 1999</p>

<p><p>Today I had a super fun and tiring hot day at work!  I&rsquo;ve been working for a small company called Cable and Electric, which installs data cables for computers or phone systems and does electrical wiring.  I&rsquo;ve been simply riding around with a guy who goes by &ldquo;Duran&rdquo; (not his real name, but I don&rsquo;t know his real name) doing odd jobs around the city.</p>

<p><p>Today our goal was to install one (1) cable between two buildings owned by a business I&rsquo;ll call DC.  The buildings were on opposite sides of an industrial street thing, with 18 wheelers and big equipment using it often.  We therefore had to string the cable way up about 20 feet in the air to make sure that it remained intact.</p>

<p><p>That meant I got to climb!</p>

<p><p>First up onto the roof of the first building, where the cable was fed from the inside through a slot in the roof.  I pulled enough cable to toss it down to Duran on the ground who pulled it around two telephone poles (on which we would eventually string the cable) and into a big pile on our side of the street.</p>

<p><p>Then I got to grab the cable and climb the roof of the other building, pulling two roof-lengths worth of cable out across the roof of the second building! I tied the cable to a pipe on the building and Duran tied it way up on the second telephone pole, so we kept it still out of reach of the trucks below.</p>

<p><p>Then I fed the cable down to Duran into the second building through a little tiny hole in the side of the building up near the roof.  I helped feed the cable through as Duran pulled it into a big pile on the floor.</p>

<p><p>Then inside the building I got to climb more!  Using an extension ladder, up to the ceiling of the two story warehouse, I fed the cable through the ceiling support beams using a pushpole to extend my reach by about 16 feet.  At two points during this process, I got to climb up huge stacks of plywood in the middle of their warehouse, feeding cable through the ceiling supports, walking on top of the plywood and carefully stepping from stack to stack.</p>

<p><p><em>Then</em> we got to send it through what turned out to be the original DC warehouse, now full of old stuff: adding machines, antique chairs, stacks and stacks of business documents, a huge huge polished wooden table, lots of stained glass windows, just all kinds of crazy fun old stuff, plus lots that we could not identify!</p>

<p><p>We reached the length of our cable before we reached our destination, so we started back at the beginning, pulling about 60 feet of slack and actually fixing the cable to its new permanent path.</p>

<p><p>That meant I got to drive/ride the 36 foot cherry picker!  It has little switches that control the length of its arm, the angle the arm points into the air, and the rotational angle that it leaves its base.  Way way fun, and I tied the our cable up to an already-attached cable on the telephone poles.  (Please note: the already-attached cable was not a power line.  I don&rsquo;t actually know what it was, except that it was well insulated, and was the lowest cable on the poles.)</p>

<p><p>We had to place the base of the cherry picker about 6 different times so I could eventually reach the entire length of suspended cable.  I got pretty proficient at driving the cherry picker as I rode in its bucket.  There were a couple of times that I was extended the full distance out and it was super wiggly, but the base stayed put and we had no problems.  Another couple of times I got to extend the bucket out over parked cars, and twice I was extended out over the street and 18 wheelers drove under me!!  Wow! Scenes from action movies jumped through my head as I wondered what it would be like to jump onto the trailers as they passed under me.</p>

<p><p>An entirely different cool experience involved one of the 18 wheelers.  The guy parked it nearby and attached a hose from his truck to a socket thing in a box near a fence.  Four large tubes extended up from the box, over the street and each attached to one of four different silos on the opposite side of the street.  Hmmmmm.</p>

<p><p>After I was done tying up the cable, I talked to the guy driving the mystery hose truck.  We had to speak loudly to be heard. &ldquo;What are you pumping?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Flour.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Flour?  You mean like, flour.&rdquo;  I made a gesture expressing flour as best I could.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Flour.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p><em>Whoah</em>, I thought. &ldquo;Whoah.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I studied the tubes for a moment, and noticed a clear bit of tubing just above where his hose attached inside the box.  Zipping straight up like a vertical river, white powder flew through the tube.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look very fast,&rdquo; he offered, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s going about 15 miles per hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I asked for other interesting numbers.  This is what I got:</p>

<p><p>His truck can carry fifty thousand pounds of flour at a time.  It takes two truck loads to fill one silo.
<br>It takes about 1 hour to unload the entire 50,000 pounds of flour from his truck.
<br>He only fills the first two silos; the other two are for wheat.
<br>He unloads his truck into one of these two silos four times per day!!!</p>

<p><p>Holy cow this bakery uses two hundred thousand pounds of flour in one day.  One bakery.  Amazing.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;ROB!!&rdquo; It was Duran.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I gotta go back to work.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>We pulled the extra cable the rest of the way through to the office where it needed to go.  I got to climb the ladder again and attach it along the upper inside wall of the warehouse.  During this process, I noticed the wall on which I had my ladder was the original exterior wall of the original warehouse.  They just added the big new warehouse onto it!  The paint was chipped and flaky on the wood slats like shingles designed to block the elements.  An old rain gutter was carefully slathered with tar to keep it waterproof, but it hadn&rsquo;t seen rain in many years.</p>

<p><p>Once we got into the office, we weren&rsquo;t actually able to finish the job; we couldn&rsquo;t pull the cable down the wall as it had multiple blocks within it, effectively blocking the way of our cable.  We&rsquo;ll probably go back on Monday and finish up.</p>

<p><p>A couple of nights ago I had a super funny experience!</p>

<p><p>I went to my dad&rsquo;s house to borrow some dollars (that&rsquo;s a different story) at about 11:30pm.  It was late, so I pretty much left by 11:45pm.</p>

<p><p>The stars were beautiful above, reminding me of my recent two weeks in Iowa, where I spent several hours just looking up at the stars.  I was kinda tired, so I decided to take a moment to lay down and stargaze in front of my dad&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p><p>My dad lives at the end of a street about 45 minutes north of Houston.  No traffic or lights or anything.  So I parked my car on the street (just in case some car came down, they would see my car and not squish me) and lay down in the street in front of it.</p>

<p><p>I chose the street to keep grass-dwelling insects off me and it offers a wide view of the sky.</p>

<p><p>Watching the stars, thinking of Iowa, I fell asleep.</p>

<p><p>[dramatic pause]</p>

<p><p>I woke suddenly when a guy was shining a flashlight in my face, his truck with lights on idling nearby.  He asked &ldquo;where are you from?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>My brain was still in Iowa, so I articulated clearly, &ldquo;Houston, Texas.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What? You from around here?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, I am really from Houston Texas.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Rob Nugen.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This is your end of the street?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What?  I&rsquo;m from Houston.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>At this moment, my brain suddenly realized I was not in Iowa.  But I couldn&rsquo;t figure out where I was!  The flashlight effectively blinded me from seeing my surroundings.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This is your dad&rsquo;s house?&rdquo; he asked.  &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t he let you in?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Recognition washed over me.  Oh yeah!  But why was I here?</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wait.  I&rsquo;ve been in Iowa for two weeks, so I thought I was still there.  Okay, this is a true story:&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I told him I had just been to Iowa, came to my dad&rsquo;s, saw him, left, saw the stars, fell asleep, and here I was.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s okay, just so long as you weren&rsquo;t hurt or anything. I drive up and see some body lying in the road&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Turns out the man is my dad&rsquo;s neighbor and a sherrif - type person driving around the area on his normal patrol.  Funny funny funny!!</p>

<p><p>Last night I went skating with a group called Inline Swine.  Far as I can tell, they don&rsquo;t associate themselves with the name so much as associating themselves with, &ldquo;we meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8pm at Texas Art Supply.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I found the group while skating alone downtown 3 weeks ago.  They were about a block away so I caught up with them. I discovered they were cool and they skate regularly so I may hook up with this group regularly!</p>

<p><p>Last night (back to the story) we skated about mmmm 12 miles?  Through lots of places I wouldn&rsquo;t go normally, simply because I didn&rsquo;t know they existed, or wouldn&rsquo;t feel safe by myself.  (mom, please note this example of common sense)</p>

<p><p>Skate skate skated from montrose and Fairview, down to Waugh, west along Memorial, then north through some back-ass streets until we crossed over I-10. As we were crossing this narrow bridge (it did have walls and a fence-cage over it, I waved and waved at the traffic!!  &ldquo;Hey!  Flash your lights!!!!&rdquo; for about 2 minutes and not a single car flashed its lights.  Not that they could hear me, but c&rsquo;mon some kind of acknowledgement is in order&hellip;  maybe a light tap on the horn or wave a hand out the window&hellip; something! Not this time.</p>

<p><p>On and on east across TC Jester and then stopped at Durham and 11th street in the Heights for drinks at a convenience store.  I was glad to stop.  I hadn&rsquo;t really skate-exerted myself that much in quite a while, plus I started out the night with kinda ripped up wheels on my right skate.  The back center wheel (inline skates) was shredded to the point of being useless.  Kinda like when a truck tire on the highway shreds, long strips of rubber peel off, I peeled off about 1 &amp; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> pi worth of tread from my wheel hub.  (That&rsquo;s 270 degrees worth. (That&rsquo;s 75%.  (That is, my wheel was useless for skating.)))</p>

<p><p>Scott said it looked to him like my front wheel on the same skate was going to shred next.  Scott and Jeff and someone else offered me some hand-me-down wheels once we got back.  I absolutely accepted.  (If I could make it back.)</p>

<p><p>Through more back streets east of Shepherd as we headed back toward downtown, my remaining wheels seemed to work fine.  Back over I-10 on some street I waved at cars, and again got no response.  Hmpf.</p>

<p><p>Then we did more and more and more skating in a generally going-back type of manner.  Crossed over Memorial on Sawyer, which is kinda cool because Sawyer forms a nice hill over Memorial, allowing for a quick zip down the hill after skating up.</p>

<p><p>Got back to Texas Art Supply and was offered some wheels by Scott.  I thanked him profusely and said bye to all my new friends and skated home.  Put on the new wheels and I&rsquo;m excited about trying them out on Thursday!!</p>

<p class=date>2:17am Friday 30 July 1999</p>

<p><p>I feel sad.  I did not make Steering Committee.  SC is the executive body that serves Youth Council, voted by and from members of Youth Council.  Waiting for the results was almost excruciating.  Even though we were singing songs and stuff.</p>

<p><p>Mandy enjoyed her secret buddy stuff today.  Geoff sang &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet&rdquo; to her on guitar, and she loved the picture that was the result of the scavenger hunt I set up for her.  It&rsquo;s a pic from last years Con Con of Mandy and Nora together.</p>

<p><p>Interesting about not making SC:  Micaela had been on the list to run, and I looked forward to working with her.  She removed her own nominatation at the last moment.  She said later, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m going to run next year, [so maybe we&rsquo;ll be on SC at the same time then.]&rdquo;  Hmmmm.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m tired as anything.  We&rsquo;re leaving tomorrow; I wonder if I&rsquo;ll have time to type up stuff in the computer lab here on campus.  (We&rsquo;re at Graceland College in Iowa in case I haven&rsquo;t mentioned that.)</p>

<p><p><hr></p>

<p><p>4:30pm Friday 30 July 1999</p>

<p><p>The wheels on the bus go round and round as we drive to Des Moines.</p>

<p><p>After sleeping in and packing and doing laundry (the sap came out of my sleeping bag nicely), we did a Carwash today for closing worship:  small groups all massage one person at a time and say nice things about them while massaging.  Very empowering and wonderful.</p>

<p><p>At closing, we each received personalized awards.  I got the Award For Loving Roller Coasters!</p>

<p><p><hr></p>

<p><p>3:10am Saturday 1 August 1999</p>

<p><p>We are at First UU church of Des Moines tonight. We got here around 5pm and have been just hanging out and stuff. I talk talk talked with youth in small random groups, actually mostly listened to their happy playful banter. I showed the pics I have from Con Con last year and gave a few away to people who would enjoy them.</p>

<p><p>I have spent about 5 hours now (not continuously) working to type up all my diary entries so far and am now caught up.  Yay!</p>

<p><p>Wende arrived at 1:45 am with 4 youth from our district: Ashley R, Bryn C, Lauren D, and Jeremy L-N.  Actually Jeremy is a young adult in our district, but still young enough to attend Con Con with us tomorrow.  They drove 11 hours (including breaks) from Ardmore, Oklahoma today. I think everyone is sleeping now.</p>

<p><p>Super duper extra special thanks to Mandy for letting me use her computer to get my journal entries written!  I am glad to have them done now and saved to floppy so that I can easily put them on the web when I get home.  Good night.</p>

<p class=date>2:20am Thursday ? July 1999</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m here at Youth Council and we&rsquo;ve been writing resolutions to define how activities are done or to create new processes or whatever..  I&rsquo;ve been working on budget related things: how YRUU budget needs to grow in the future, and another on how YRUU will distribute money through grants to different local YRUU groups.</p>

<p><p>Those probably don&rsquo;t mean much to you, but suffice to say that the youth here now tonight are doing big stuff and working together to truly affect their world.</p>

<p><p><hr align="left" width="20%"></p>

<p><p>Holy cow.  Now it&rsquo;s 5:30am, and we completed our resolution, grant application and an example grant application.  The example is funny!!!!  I think it&rsquo;s even funny enough to be funny tomorrow after we sleep.</p>

<p><p>A man has just arrived to vacuum the floors and stuff.  It&rsquo;s late; going to bed soon, though I think I&rsquo;ll write about today.</p>

<p><p>Today Wednesday, we had plenary and then lunch.  After lunch my stomach was feeling blucky so I slept through workshops.  After workshops was the Super Secret Activity, which we had no idea what to expect, but they said we should wear swimsuits.  Piled into vans and drove for about 20 minutes to a state park where we stopped at a lakefront beach thing.  Yay!!  Quickly we were all in the water, splashing around and whatever.  Bryan challenged me to a holding breath contest.  I beat him the first time and then I tried again to beat my own time.  To exceed my own time, I gently hyperventilated until my arms and legs were tingling nicely then went under water and gently allowed my thoughts float away. I kinda focused on the tingling and just floated.  I could hear the youth talking and when someone said something like, &ldquo;oh my gosh,&rdquo; I held up my thumb, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay!&rdquo;   I finally resurfaced after 2 minutes 35 seconds.  Nice.</p>

<p><p>A bit shallower, some people had found that sitting gently in the water would result in minnows gently nibbling their skin.  Responses to this fact varied between, &ldquo;let me try!&rdquo; to &ldquo;oh my gosh that&rsquo;s gross!&rdquo;   I tried and <em>yow</em> a minnow nibbled my nipple!  Game over for me after that!</p>

<p><p>Ate lunch then played frisbee in the water until time to leave.  Listened to Bryan&rsquo;s Southpark CD on the way back here to Graceland College.</p>

<p><p>As people first started working on their resolutions tonight, I set up a cool treasure hunt for Mandy, my secret buddy.  It starts with a note at her seat that she&rsquo;ll hopefully find tomorrow morning, leads her through 2 notes, 1 person, 2 more notes, 2 people and the second (4th) person will have the gift, a picture of Mandy and Nora at Con Con last year!</p>

<p><p>Worship tonight was great, starting in a circle singing in a room, to watching some youth dance, to all of us dancing outside under the full moon.  Nice.</p>

<p><p>Finished the funny example grant application and will probably include it here.</p>

<p><p>Good night (still have to walk back to my room and take my contacts out)  It&rsquo;s 6:00am.</p>
