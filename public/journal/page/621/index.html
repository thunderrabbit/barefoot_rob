<p class=date>9:31pm CDT Friday 12 May 2000</p></p>

<p><p>In my study Wende and I put up my Elfa shelves and my desk and
everything!!  It&rsquo;s so ergonomically correct and lovely!  My previous
journal entries had been typed with my keyboard on my lap or balanced
on a drawer, with the desk backwards and the monitor at the wrong
level.  Now all that is corrected and I love it!</p>

<p><p>So thankful to Wende that we could work together on this project
and finish it in record time.  Now it&rsquo;s supper time!!</p>

<p><p>Wende says, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s super time&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p class=date>2:17pm CDT Saturday 13 May 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Last night Wende and I had a great heart-to-heart conversation.
Short version is that I tend to bottle my anger when she gets bitchy
when she&rsquo;s hungry or tired.  She&rsquo;ll snap, and I won&rsquo;t respond at all.
I&rsquo;m afraid that if I do say something it will be really mean, so I
just don&rsquo;t say it.</p>

<p><p>We agreed last night that I would say it.  Wende understands that
no matter what I say in anger, I still love her bajillions.</p>

<p><p>I love our relationship.  I love that we communicate so well.
Great great great great great!!!</p>

<p class=date>6:00pm CDT Thursday 11 May 2000</p></p>

<p><p>I attended day 1 of a two day course on SAS Macro programming.
I&rsquo;ve learned a few things today, but most of the stuff I know already
from what I&rsquo;ve picked up at work.</p>

<p><p>Ted, the instructor, speaks in an almost staccato (is that the
right term?) manner, nearly emphasizing each word.  I&rsquo;m reminded of
Howard Cosell at times.</p>

<p><p>The coolest thing about the course: It&rsquo;s in the building next to
Telecheck.  So during lunch I visited Molly and she escorted me around
to all my old homies at Telecheck.</p>

<p><p>Met Catherine (sp), cute with braces (go ahead and tell her,
Molly), who commented, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re wearing shoes&rdquo; as soon as she met me.
Woah!  I removed them before anyone else saw me wearing them.</p>

<p>Me the guy who made wonderful brownies, and a couple other peeps in
Molly&rsquo;s group.  Saw Jeff (HI Jeff!) and Pam (HI Pam!), and then spent
most of my lunch break talking to Dave, my ex supervisor (Dave, I&rsquo;m
using the term &lsquo;ex&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;old&rsquo;) and Alan in his group and Chris
when he wandered by. (Mario split with Kate as soon as I walked in, so
I didn&rsquo;t get to talk to them)</p>

<p><p>Updated them on our house, and engagement, and unicycle&hellip;  got the
latest scoop on the group and how few people are left in the whole
department now.</p>

<p><p>As my time dwindled, a quick HI to Guy and Karen in the next group.
Guy has given his notice&hellip; Good luck in your endeavors!</p>

<p><p>On the way out, said HI to Barry and Carl, in their private
half-dozen-cubicle-suite which used to be two offices.</p>

<p><p>Then with perfect timing, I got to the elevators just as Serena was
coming back from lunch.  Quick hug to her and &ldquo;gotta go!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Wonderful to see everyone again!</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>Said HI to Wende on the way home; she&rsquo;s at work until 10pm.  Bluh.
I&rsquo;m gonna go ride my (borrowed) unicycle now.  See ya!</p>

<p class=date>7:05pm CDT Thursday 11 May 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Wow.  In one hour I unied (past tense of &ldquo;rode my (borrowed)
unicycle&rdquo;) from our house, three blocks to the gas station, put air in
the tire (it was a little flat) and rode almost all the way back.  On
the way back, I found it so much easier!  Note to fellow uniers: keep
your tire inflated!</p>

<p><p>(oh!  At the gas station I saw Meek from Saturday Night Ultimate!
He waved wildly at me, but didn&rsquo;t stop.)</p>

<p><p>Without falling, I rode 2.5 full blocks with full tire, including
turning and avoiding holes, etc.  Super great!  I rode two blocks away
to the nearby restaurant, then back, each direction in one shot. (not
both directions in one shot).  I rode a tiny bit more after reaching
the house again, but find myself just tired (pun intended).</p>

<p><p>I have a slight curved scar on the back of my left calf from the
pedal grinding across my leg when I fell.  Now I have a curved cut on
the back of my right calf.</p>

<p><p>Oh my gosh you have to try this!!!!!!!</p>

<p><p>Items you need:
<br>Small packet of Pop Rocks candy (or equivalent)
<br>1 cup of tasty beverage (your choice)
<br>1 stethoscope (optional)</p>

<p><p>What to do:
<ol><li>Put all the Pop Rocks in your mouth
<li>Wash them down with tasty beverage
<li>Listen carefully to your stomach!
</ol></p>

<p><p>I just did this to see what would happen, and I could clearly hear
the Pop Rocks popping inside my stomach!  And I don&rsquo;t even have a
stethoscope!!</p>

<p><p>I just wish Wende were here to laugh with me!</p>

<p><p>Karla has found a different location to which we might move our office.  She likes it even better!  I do too, because it&rsquo;s closer to my house!!!!   Not just closer than the other new possible place, but closer than our current location!   Way way way cool!!</p>

<p><p>KTRU was fun today; I recorded the whole show for Sford and friends at <a href="https://www.geeky-boy.com/cgi-bin/bbs_thingie">BBST</a>.  I tossed in a couple of sneaky references &hellip; &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have &lsquo;Feather Boa&rsquo; by Wild Rabbit&hellip;&rdquo;  It&rsquo;s an inside joke thing.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m a tad tired after last night but not ridiculously so.</p>

<p class=date>10:01pm CDT Wednesday 10 May 2000</p></p>

<p><p>So I didn&rsquo;t go to ultimate after all.  Got downstairs and
thought&hellip; &ldquo;unicycle&rdquo; because I haven&rsquo;t ridden in a while and my
(borrowed) unicycle is right here in my trunk, while ultimate is way
over there in a field.</p>

<p><p>I did relatively great!  I successfully turned 360 degrees within
the radius of our street (3 cars wide) plus sidewalk (including going
up and back down the slight driveway slope)!  In the intersection of
two 3-lane streets (I&rsquo;m talking 3 lanes total - two for parked cars
and one for traffic in between) I successfully turned 360+ degrees
more than once!  Super cool.  And once just once I felt perfectly
relaxed while riding.  Normally my muscles are all tense and jumpy.  I
think a lot of being able to relax is sitting correctly on the seat
(so that all my weight points straight down through the center of the
wheel).</p>

<p><p>At one point a girl driving by stopped.  &ldquo;That is so coool!!&rdquo;  She
described a guy in Jamaica that could ride a tall unicycle &ldquo;just like
it was his own feet&rdquo; and how she was so impressed by him!  We talked a
bit, and I thanked her for her encouragement!</p>

<p><p>Rode around some more until sweat drenched my shirt, making me too
hot n sticky to wanna ride.  Great job, Rob!</p>

<p><p>A couple of interesting things at work today:</p>

<p><ol> <p><li>With some help from Kevin, I rewrote a screen on our big
project.  This screen is called rateWho; it displays a list of names
for whom an individual may provide feedback. Originally, I designed
the screen so that if a person had missed the time-frame to rate
someone, that someone&rsquo;s name would not show up.  As written, the
screen checked a field in a dataset to see if it was too late to
provide feedback.</p>

<p><p>The new improved design requires that all names be displayed.  The
&ldquo;too late&rdquo; names are written in a different list that says something
like, &ldquo;Too late, sucker,&rdquo; or something to that effect.</p>

<p><p>Kevin wrote a phat SQL query (I&rsquo;ve messed with SQL before, but
don&rsquo;t totally remember it now) that pulled in 3 different data sets
and created one table with all the information I needed to output the
appropriate lists.  I finished it at 6pm and zipped home.</p>

<p><p><li>We are moving.  Work, I mean.</p>

<p><p>The landlords have increased our rent by 60%, but have not
increased the quality of the building worth a dooky, so we are outta
there!  Timeframe is like 60 to 90 days.  It&rsquo;s pretty exciting, and
I&rsquo;m thankful that I basically know enough about the network that I can
transfer it as it exists to the new location.  It&rsquo;ll mean hooking up a
new DSL circuit at our new place; I will call our ISP soonly on that.</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;re moving just 2 city blocks away, which is not too far, but
significant for me: it&rsquo;s on the other side of the freeway, and 2 city
blocks further away from our new house.  I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll survive.  Maybe I&rsquo;ll get a bike soon and bike those extra two blocks.</p>

<p>Ack.  I just got a call from Kevin.  He booted our webserver
tonight and it's not coming back up.  After it checks the memory,
finds the disks, gets past the "press spacebar to use last known good
configuration", it flashes error codes and restarts.

<p>I'm going in to work now.

<p class=date>3:45am CDT Wednesday 10 May 2000</p>

<p><p>Sure enough, when I arrive the server was still rebooting itself as
described above.  I didn&rsquo;t know what to try, except maybe reinstalling
Win NT on the machine&hellip; maybe it would allow us to refresh the system
files instead of overwriting everything.  We really didn&rsquo;t want to
lose any data.</p>

<p><p>I asked Kevin if it was more important to save the data or just
blast through and reinstall, which would (probably) be faster.  He
said saving the data is more important.</p>

<p><p>Called Microsoft support, paid $245, and the short version of the
story is that all data was safe.</p>

<p><p>Mostly just in talking to the tech guy (Derek (sp)), I worked
myself through my own solution.</p>

<p><p>First brainstorm: we have two drives in the machine, and they are
mirrored.  So presumably, we can take one drive out, have the copy of
the data there, fix the other drive, restore the data.</p>

<p><p>Took one drive out, and magically, the other drive booted no
problem.  And all the data was there..  Except it was all one week
old.</p>

<p><p>Swapped the drives, and magically, the other other drive booted no
problem.  And all the data was there.  And it was up to date.</p>

<p><p>The theory is that when we had a power outage last week, one drive
was corrupted, and hadn&rsquo;t been written to since.  When we tried to
boot with both drives, the OS said, &ldquo;hey these drives aren&rsquo;t
mirrored!&rdquo; and wouldn&rsquo;t boot.</p>

<p><p>Low level formatted the week-old-data drive, recreated the mirror,
everything is happy.</p>

<p><p>During the low level format, I got to talk to Hillary on AOL IM.
That was great fun!  Now I&rsquo;m going to bed.</p>
