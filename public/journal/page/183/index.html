<ol>
<li>Maybe the biggest overall thing, which I <em>hope</em> will become a big
thing in the future: In October, I&rsquo;m going to staff a NWTA in
Perth, with other men from <a href="https://mkp.org">https://mkp.org</a></li>
<li>I have my plane tickets and all other costs are covered cause I&rsquo;m
coming from overseas.</li>
<li>I just bought a soft plastic stackable brick toy set for Lin&rsquo;s
clients&rsquo; son&rsquo;s enjoyment. PolyM, Art.-No. 73061 Helicopter, after
having been given the chance to play with a big box of the bricks
to make &ldquo;anything,&rdquo; so long as it fit on the shelf here next to
まい&rsquo;s creations.  I guess she was all created-out after making a
few different displays with the bricks.</li>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t take a picture of my creation, but it was kindof round;
the pieces are soft-ish and more forgiving than LEGO, both for
construction and trodding with bare feet!  I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re also
far less durable, but oh well.</li>
<li>Today I saw a note that c0de is stepping down from his many years
of hosting DELTA minecraft server.  I thanked him for his hard
work, and he&rsquo;ll certainly be missed!  (not that it will affect me
at this juncture; I haven&rsquo;t logged on to the server in months)</li>
<li>Today at work I helped Satomi fix her /etc/hosts file to reconnect
to a website which inexplicably has had its DNS misconfigured. I
mean how hard can it be?  I said, &ldquo;it should have the same IP
address as (ABC site),&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s still not fixed.</li>
<li>Mutsumi has retired from lessons for the time being.  He said he&rsquo;s
busy.  No, not Mutsumi!  The <em>other</em> Mutsumi!  Happily, Mutsumi&rsquo;s
still attending, and I&rsquo;m thankful for her hard work, both at study
and looking for other students to fill Mutsumi&rsquo;s place!</li>
<li>I haven&rsquo;t gone to Japanese class for months(?)</li>
<li>I haven&rsquo;t drawn a maze for a month?</li>
<li>BUT, Pop Pop Chaos is coming along pretty well.  I am sorta-close
to having rolling high score list implemented, but I just need to
deal with user&rsquo;s names having been stored in different locations
based on how they logged in (via U/P or Oauth).  Bubbles grow when
clicked, the turn dark in proportion to how close they are to
popping, and people reach the high score list based not on points,
but on <em>creates</em>, which require points to obtain.  I&rsquo;m pretty happy
with it so far.</li>
<li>The GG lesson used to be M, T, and Te, but now it&rsquo;s going to be
just M and Te.  And only for 1 hour instead of an hour an a half.
Boo, but still better than a big bowl of nothin&rsquo;.  Only problem is
M tends to speak more than Te, so I want to be careful to make sure
Te has enough talk time.</li>
<li>Had a new student today in other class (via Tariq); he&rsquo;ll join for
two months, which is perfect because C has said she&rsquo;ll be busy for
2 months.  She will hopefully enjoy slightly easier lessons than
what I had been doing to challege her before the new student
joined.</li>
<li></li>

When trying to register, I tried to use a password including symbols: u$e#%5j9Q%s 

I copied and pasted this password into the password and password-verify fields, but I got the message
&quot;Please match the requested format&quot;, which a normal person won't understand, first of all, and second
of all points to a bigger problem: 

In your password validation system, you have pattern=&quot;u$e#%5j9Q%s&quot; to see if the passwords match. 

Obviously if you slap this into a regex thing, the pattern won't match because there's a $ which means end of string. 

Anyway, I'm not sure I want to use your service if it cannot handle passwords properly.

creating multiple little scripts to do multiple little things</p>

<p>Satomi came down at the perfect time; I had just finished and
committed a set of changes for a new process for the AB site.  They
want new data added to the historical primary tables, gleaned from
data in the secondary tables (basically log tables).</p>

<p>Basically things in the primary table can be active or inactive.  We
have a log of when they were activated and deactivated.  The cycle of
(in)active toggles can spans years at times, or could just be days.</p>

<p>Each month I take a snapshot of the primary data for doing trend
reports.  Now, the snapshots obviously know if their rows are active
or inactive at the time of the snapshot, but they don&rsquo;t know how
<em>long</em> they had been (in)active at the time of the snapshot.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what my new code needs to do.  Go back and look at the log,
calculate the ranges of (in)activity, and fill in the newly-created
blanks in the historical snapshots.  Fun!</p>

<p>Fortunately, it&rsquo;s a DB table &ldquo;log&rdquo; so there&rsquo;s no text parsing
required.  But I do have to deal with objects being set to inactive or
to active multiple times in a row. something like this, for item
number 5, (but with a lot more data haha):</p>

<pre><code>5  inactive 2004-03-06
5  active   2004-08-28
5  inactive 2006-11-12
5  active   2007-07-28
5  active   2007-09-24
5  inactive 2009-06-21
5  active   2010-04-03

<p>A couple days ago I noted someone burst a bubble on
<a href="https://www.poppopchaos.com/">Pop Pop Chaos</a>, so I joined the fun!  It
seemed s/he was only interested in bursting bubbles, not creating
them, so I created some, and then joined the fun and we just popped
alll the bubbles.  The white ones kept coming back, as they do, but
then after a while I created a bunch of blue bubbles in a row, so he&rsquo;d
(be more likely to) know it wasn&rsquo;t computer-generated bubbles, well..
not algorithm generated,.. well, anyway, then blam!  he made a bunch
of yellow bubbles, and raced up the leaderboard and then suddenly
vanished!  I was like O_o what happened?</p>

<p>I found houston:admin, which perfectly augmented the app with DB admin
skillz.  Perfect!  I discovered what happened: in his flurry of
creates, rancidpony won a race with the server and created more
bubbles than he had points to create!</p>

<p>His point value went negative and he promptly vanished from the high
score list, because that&rsquo;s how I was distinguishing <em>my</em> account
(which always has permissions to create, despite its score of -2300 or
something.</p>

<p>So I retooled the logic which populates the leaderboard to say admin
cannot join, but negative score people are welcome.  So rancidpony has
-35 points and is halfway up the leaderboard!</p>

<p>AND <a href="https://www.poppopchaos.com/about">rancidpony is credited</a> with
finding a bug. Thanks!</p>

<p>Nice!  Fred suggested I use color to indicate how close a bubble was
to popping.  I told him it was a good idea, though I already had it in
mind, possibly from Travis or Johan, but just hadn&rsquo;t implemented it
yet.</p>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s part of the game, and was reallly easy to do, thanks to d3:</p>

<p>I changed</p>

<pre><code>var circleColor = function(d) {
  return d.color;
};
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>var circleColor = function(d) {
  return d3.rgb(d.color).darker(2*(d.touches/d.maxTouches));
};
</code></pre>

<p>Periscope is a pretty neat thing, and hopefully a step in the right
direction.  I once said we will be in the future if at any moment,
without really &ldquo;doing&rdquo; anything, I can live chat with my brother or
anyone I like.</p>

<p>Periscope is live, but it&rsquo;s not my brother on the other end; it&rsquo;s not
two-way, and I have to get out my phone, but dang if it&rsquo;s not live
video.</p>

<p>Yesterday I paid for my tickets to Perth!  Now I need to get my
visa.</p>

<p>There were a couple of errors on AB yesterday, but I haven&rsquo;t changed
anything recently, so I guess it&rsquo;s a part of the system people don&rsquo;t
use very often!  I didn&rsquo;t do a git blame to figure out when it
happened, but the fix was easy: specify which table to use for a
particular field.  I guess it would be smart to do that by default.</p>

<p>Tariq and I released the first version of
<a href="https://com759.wix.com/chatforestgames">Pongdemonium</a>!  I immediately
see that it needs levels and varied gameplay to get any traction.</p>

<p>To do today:</p>

<ol>
<li><del>teach extra lesson in Ebisu</del></li>
<li><del><a href="https://twitter.com/thunderrabbit/status/636683844331048960">Broadcast my walk across Ebisu station</a></del></li>
<li>get OZ visa</li>
<li>work on poppopchaos or pongdemonium</li>
<li>meet Satomi for CB</li>
<li>teach extra lesson in Shinagawa</li>
<li>teach normal lesson in Akihabara</li>
</ol>

<p>I changed my life in 1997 by attending a weekend men&rsquo;s retreat organized by <a href="https://mkp.org/">https://mkp.org/</a> My ability to understand myself and my emotions / motivations grew exponentially from there. I&rsquo;m by no means an expert, but I&rsquo;m much better able to listen to others, and express myself&hellip;. though not in this post, apparently!!</p>

<p>Anyway, I have missed the energy of this organization since moving to Japan, and recently decided to get involved again. I&rsquo;m heading to Perth in October(*) with the hopes that it will rekindle the fire of authentic ROB within me!</p>

<p>(*) 95% confirmed. :-)</p>
