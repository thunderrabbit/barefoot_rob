<p>Woah.  That was close.</p>

<p>The train looked like a normal Toyoko line train (same interior and
exterior), but the map on the interior was different than I'm used
to.  (I didn't *look* at the map, but saw it for some reason)</p>

<p>We stopped on the wrong side of Jiogaoka station, given that it was
a local train, and some peeps got off.  I was like, "err?" and asked
the cat next to me, "shibuya ikimaska?"</p>

<p>"ikimasen" and he pointed to the other side of the platform.</p>

<p>"uh oh." Oh shit, and I got up and barely made it out the door.</p>

<p>Yay!  I escaped the wrong train just at the last second!</p>

<p>Woke up at 6:30ish cause the NHK (?) (Japanese public radio) started
speaking in English and I was like, "wha?" cause it was no longer just
incomprehensible yammering slowly seeping into my brain.</p>

<p>Listened to the translations; tried to comprehend.  Of course the
Japanese was spoken quickly and the English translations slowly.  Not
as many listeners in my demographic.</p>

<p>Up, found an email from janette (she found a problem with the
search thing), shower, and took a million years to get dressed because
I don't like cold weather and hoped to discover some way around
experiencing it.</p>

<p>(It's not *really* cold today, but I'm planning ahead for when it
does get cold.)</p>

<p>Anyway, it was a challenge riding my bike with one hand while
monitoring the progress of Morisan's bike with the other.   It's not
something that I would like to do every day, but it is something that
I'd get better at doing if I did it every day.  Also, I would have a
really strong left hand.</p>

<p>Didn't hit any people, cars, bikes, netc (etc for a list of things
that are not included in the list) all the way here.  Even rode up the
short (4 meters long, 1.5 meters tall (when did I start thinking in
meters?)) incline at the International Lounge.</p>

<p>Parked Morisan's bike and rode to the local alcohol shop to get
some breakfast - a bag of shelled scallops with toothpick included.
Good protein, though a little salty.  Bought a Pocari Sweat
(translucent white, not yellow) and headed back to the Lounge.</p>

<p>Happy.</p>

<p>Walked up to the front.</p>

<pre>
      CLOSE
 Please come later
</pre>

<p>Sad.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Aw man.  I don't want to drag the bike back home and back here next
week.  I considered writing a journal entry about what had happened so
far, but decided I could write it while waiting for a response from
Kobayashisan (who translated between Morisan and I that I would return
the bike today) on what to do.</p>

<p>Called her.  Watched a shinkansen go by as the phone rang.  Left a
message.</p>

<p>Thirty seconds later, a woman walked up the steps to open the
lounge.</p>

<p>"nevamind!" (*)</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>The International Lounge staff noticed what I was eating.  "Kai,"
it's called.</p>

<p>"We usually eat these with alcohol."</p>

<p>"Really?   Today, Pocari Sweat."</p>

<p>"And never for breakfast."</p>

<p>"Ah."</p>

<p>Ah as in meh.</p>

<p>(*) Who here remembers Rosanne Rosanna Danna?  (I barely do)</p>

<p>Class was a bit better this week than it was last week.  I could
swear that Kobayashisan (now this is a different Kobayashisan than the
one mentioned earlier today.  This Kobayashisan is Chinese and knows
no English) was flirting with me.  She would occasionally look into my
eyes and smile as I was fucking up slash not understanding the
Japanese in the class.  Flirting?  Sympathy?  And during break we were
(actually they were (they = Grace and Kobayashi, both women, both from
China) and I joined them) looking at videos for loan and she leaned
her leg against me.  Damn I'm desperate for any kind of contact.</p>

<p>After class, though, poof; they both left with no fanfare.</p>

<p>After after class, I gave Morisan the key to her bicycle and tried
to comprehend her Japanese questions.  Thanked her thoroughly for the
use of the bike.  Wonder if I should have gotten her a gift of thanks.
Probably would have if Koko and I were still hanging out.  Or even if
she would simply return any of my attempted contacts.  (phone, email,
hand delivered letter (via her mom))</p>

<p>Okay.   I've just been chillin' and realized the following things:</p>

<p>I'm not really happy in Japan.</p>

<p>I could be playing/working with janette all the time instead.</p>

<p>I would miss people here.</p>

<p>Would I?  True friends will last no matter what.</p>

<p>I could blow this popsicle stand (who coined that) and work with
janette and sell art and read to her in bed</p>

<p>Why am I here?</p>

<p>There's a fear that if I leave here, I won't be able to come back.</p>

<p>Shit has got to get happier here or I'm leaving.</p>

<p>I can change my situation (housing, job), or change my attitude
(release the pressure to learn Japanese)</p>

<p>What about taking pictures of all the coasters in Japan?</p>

<p>Need piles of fat cash to do that.   (this is an assumption; I
haven't looked into it really)</p>

<p>Often I try to do everything alone (even though my greatest fear is
being alone).   I wonder why this is.   I wonder if they're inexorably
intertwined.</p>

<p>I'm going to meet Cory to go skate in 27 minutes.</p>

<br>Hey, Rob,<br>
<br>
I do hope you&rsquo;ll stay long enough for our visit! I know you&rsquo;re frustrated and unhappy, but what happened to the zen approach&ndash;settling into the moment and observing people as they are. You are getting an incredible education. I&rsquo;m proud of you. But if you come back early, I&rsquo;ll still love you!<br>
<br>
Wow&ndash;I just looked it up, thinking we&rsquo;ll be there in 3 weeks, but it&rsquo;s only 18 days! <br>
<br>
This evening I&rsquo;ll be talking to the Bay Area Search Committee. They have just received a list of five ministers who have indicated interest in coming to Bay Area. My job is to go through the process of evaluating and selecting pre-candidates and a final candidate to present to the congregation. This is their second year of search.<br>
<br>
I started water aerobics twice a week for the month of October. It&rsquo;s actually a good workout. If I keep going, I may switch to Monday and Wednesday, then go to the other side of the Y on Friday for treadmill and the machine circuit. Before October I had been doing that 3 times a week (most weeks).<br>
<br>
Haven&rsquo;t heard from Fred in a while. I guess he&rsquo;s been busy with school.<br>
<br>
Last week I was in Essex, MA, 30 miles north of Boston for the UUMA Exec fall meeting. Looooonnnnggg meetings 9-5 for 3 days plus 2 travel days. In January we go to Santa Fe, in April to Portland, OR, and in June (before GA) to Long Beach, CA. It&rsquo;s amazing how many issues they deal with on behalf of all UU ministers.<br>
<br>
YARN had its one night retreat Oct. 3-4. I think there were 8 of us and we had a good time. Next spring they want to make it 2 nights, using a 3-day weekend when they&rsquo;re out of work and school.<br>
<br>
Madeleine is coming to Austin for a visit this weekend! Jon is actually replacing the bathroom sink and vanity upstairs before then. Eventually you&rsquo;ll get to use it on a visit!<br>
<br>
Lots of love,<br>
<br>
Ma</p>

<p>The view from the top of the Prince Hotel in Yokohama is quite
impressive.  42nd floor is simply furnished with 3/4 couch type things
and small tables. Along the inside of this circular room, food is
available buffet style.  Wow.  I would definitely have taken janette
up here for lunch had I known about it.  I wonder how I can surprise
her with such a lunch.</p>

<p>Liz invited me to lunch with her.  She paid (sweet!) and we
yammered in Japanese a bit (mostly she yammered and I tried to catch
on slash keep up) and then in English, she asked me specifically about
the usage of "any" in various contexts and then (fruitlessly) asked me
some intricacies about baseball.</p>

<p>We flirted fo sheezy, but I'm a little uncomfortable with it
because I don't really trust her..  She always seems to be withholding
a bit of information, like she won't be totally honest.  Won't answer
questions, even after she says, "guess," and then just laughs at my
answers.  Stuff like how old her daughters are, um, okay that's the
only example of that, but then when I was like, "so when can we hang
out again?" she was totally evasive.  Just "Of course we can.  Later.
definitely later."</p>

<p>(( Carla was recently describing this phenomenon... actuallly it
was one of my students who said directly there is a habit in Japanese
culture of non-close-friends saying, "oh yeah, we'll go hang out
sometime," and then literally never doing it.  ((In the US we say,
"we'll have to get together sometime," or "give me a call sometime,"
which I guess is the same thing, but it doesn't seem as direct as "we
will hang out sometime."))  And then Carla was telling me her Japanese
friends always keep her at arms' length.  "It's so cool to have a
gaijin friend, but I can never meet their friends nor family." ))</p>

<p>So I was a bit put off by that, (damn am I imagining I can
recognize Japanese cultural patterns?) but what am I going to do about
it besides not really trust her?</p>

<p>The saddest part about it (that I can see) is I'm desperate for Japanese
friends and will therefore take this kind of "abuse" (treatment) for
lack of any other apparent options.  Except for my students, I have
only once had two consecutive hang out times planned.  That was
with Nami back when we went to Fujiku Highland (we planned that trip
and then planned a movie (T3) in the interim) and I literally haven't
seen her since ((even though I <em>still</em> owe her 10,000 yen!!!!))</p>

<p>I am <em>JUST</em> arriving in Shibuya (the train ride is long
enough that I've been able to write the previous two entries) to see
Fumi when she texted me:</p>

<pre>
つぎの　かようび

きょうまで　おやすみ
ですね。　らいしゅう
の　かようびに　しぶ
やで　まっています。
ふみ
</pre>

<p>Sorry, jack, I can't meet you till next week.</p>

<p>(except written politely and in hiragana)</p>

<p>She is stuck at work, or so I understand from subsequent messages,
which sucks for her I know.  I guess she waited until the last minute
to see if in fact she could meet me, but cannot.</p>

<p>At least:</p>

<p>!) I didn't go through the turnstiles at Shibuya</p>

<p>@) I got to write on the way here</p>

<p>#) I get to write on the way back</p>

<p>$) this is my worst problem right now</p>

<p>%) I got to hear a funny story</p>

<p>I called DruDaddyG and he told me a funny story.  He was listening
to slash reading a CD at HMV (big music store chain).  His mate was
like, "aight snoops, let's roll," and they went to a restaurant where
Dru discovered he was still holding the CD.</p>

<p>HAHAHAHhahaahahaaahhaha!</p>

<p>He was like, "What do I <em>do</em>???"   hahahaha</p>

<p>He is unavailable for hanging out tonight, but we promised text
messages tomorrow; he'll be in Yokohama.  I may be in Yokohama in an
effort to find the amusement park that Liz told me about today.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I couldn't find anyone else to call: it's too early to call Nami
(only after 7pm), I just called Miki yesterday, and a cointoss said
not to call Rieko (she and I are going to a plastination thing on the
29th)</p>

<p>So I'm on the train going back to Tsunashima now.</p>

<p>If one thing goes as planned, I'll meet Cory for a Wild Skating
Adventure tonight.</p>

<p>Unreal.</p>

<p>My skate clasp broke irrepairably when I strapped it on.</p>

<p>No, I'm not kidding.</p>

<p>Do I go and buy new ones?  Probably.</p>

<br>Hi--noticed it's raining in Tokyo and Yokohama. Should we expect a lot of rain when we come? I'm guessing so....<br>

<p>I added a search thing to my site.  It's not fast, and it's only in
beta-mode.  I turned on the index thing, but it's not much faster, and
the index is just a file of all the text of all the files in the
directories: 5 megs worth of slow index.  Pfff.</p>
