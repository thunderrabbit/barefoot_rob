<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<p><ol>
<p><li>Work is fun and busy.  Two days ago I got the questions to be
asked in a new survey (Part II of the Ritz survey), and yesterday I
recognized that I needed to account for a new possibility in
displaying the survey.  Previously we had questions whose answers
would determine which questions to skip on a different page.  Now we
have a question that needs to skip the entire page.  It took me about
6 hours realtime (not Rob CPU time) to determine a solution.</p>

<p><p>Today I need to create logic to display a new question type.
Hopefully that will take a lot less than 6 hours.</p>

<p><p><li>My &ldquo;injury&rdquo; thing on my chin is back.  I made an appointment
with a dermatologist, but the appointment is not until 4 December, by
which time the injury will be gone.  Basically I <em>barely</em> nicked my
chin with a razor and it slowly gets big and infected and then heals
itself.  We&rsquo;ve put neosporin on it with no effect.  This time we are
puttin Tea Tree Oil on it.  I haven&rsquo;t noticed any effect.</p>

<p><p><li>Wende and I have been fighting about what to do with the money
she has invested in a money market account.  I want to move the money
to Jason&rsquo;s brokerage so we can make trades with it very easily and so
I have super close contact with what happens to the account.</p>

<p><p>As I write this I realize that I just want super close access to
the account right now, and I might lose interest later (no pun
intended).  So maybe we should just go with one of the &ldquo;Plans&rdquo; Merrill
Lynch has and stay with them.</p>

<p><p>I just want to buy into the market now because all everything is
down due to various factors.  I believe it will all rally again once
the presidency is decided and the new year begins.</p>

<p><p>Wow.  I finished the Ritz II survey today.  So awesome.  I had to
create a new question type which allows essentially a set of questions
to have a two dimensional set of answers.  Very awesome.  It allows
for each question to have up to 10 x 10 array of answers.  It&rsquo;s weird
and cool.  nevermind.</p>

<p><p>So anyway it&rsquo;s done and I&rsquo;m super impressed with it.  This is a
survey created in 3 days instead of the usual 2 weeks.</p>

<p><p>Yay!!</p>

<p><p>Wende and I are going to see Stacy and Rodderick tonight.  See ya!</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>Oh!!</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m a lot closer on the days old counter.  It now stores cookies to
remember what date someone wants to use.  It doesn&rsquo;t properly delete
the cookies though.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>In order to purchase things with different forms of
money (cash, credit card, check, farkle), one had to know a different
protocol for navigating the internet.  Jason was able to figure out
that protocol where I ws not.  He was in a combination of a machine
tht required some literal motion up and down to connect to different
sources of money, and some typing to tell it navigationally where one
wanted to move.</p>

<p><p class=dream>A building, children, room, table, men,
<br>I was late for my I group and in a hotel.</p>

<p><p class=dream>In a hotel and had to ask them where to get clean
sheets and I needed a waterhose to clean them and I got to the room
next dor where ther was a big bathrub andd I sprayed the waterhose
everywhere and down on this shee thing to wash it off and the phone
rang so I answered it, and it was a guy who could see me, but I
coudlnt&rsquo; see him, and he asked if I knew Robin Leach, and I told him,
no, but I knew of him, and began to tel this phone guy the story of
how Robin Leach and I were in training togehter and I was basically
describing my warriror training</p>

<p><p class=dream>I had to go to my I-Group, so I asked someone to give
him my contact information - address, email, phone, so he could calll
me up later.</p>

<p><p>Just for the record, I felt so tired that I almost didn&rsquo;t come type
this dream.</p>

<p class=date>7:11am CST Sunday 19 November 2000
<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>A tunnel for cars had just been partially unearthed.  I
walked down what was now a trough, toward an apparent underground
series of tunnels; maybe a parking garage.  I became frightened that I
may be hurt by a car not expecting a person in the tunnels, so I
climbed out of the trough and up a large oak tree.  I recognized I was
in the tree where no one had been before; I started out higher than
ground level by climbing to the tree from the trough.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I had found a nest of sorts, consisting of a nice
padded layer of spanish moss in a naturally formed cup in the tree&rsquo;s
branches.  I climbed down so as to not disturb the nest, and because I
didn&rsquo;t want to break any branches that were too small to support my
weight.</p>

<p><p> - - -</p>

<p><p class=dream>A woman I had just met was becoming famous through her
singing or performing and I was at the filming of one of her videos.
There was a large crowd of onlookers and many people wanted to be
chosen to be in her video.  She walked along the crowd of people,
selecting eager faces from the crowd.  I played neutrally interested
and when she looked at me, I gave a slight nod of my head, <em>choose
me.</em></p>

<p><p class=dream>She did choose me, but said something like, if you get
kicked out of the video then don&rsquo;t be upset.</p>

<p><p class=dream>&ldquo;If I get kicked out of the video, you will not be
fired, so don&rsquo;t worry about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>On the way to the set, he hugged me and we barely
kissed, but I was all, &ldquo;Better not kiss me; if someone sees it, you&rsquo;ll
get home and the phone will be ringing, or actually there will already
be messages on your machine.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>We arrived at the set and there was one young man on
the trampoline in pain; he had landed on the side because someone
wasn&rsquo;t watching and blocking to keep him on the trampoline.  The coach
was berating those who hadn&rsquo;t paid attention, but no one was attending
the injured person.  So I asked him if I may touch him.  He fearfully
said yes (fearful of possible extra pain), and I laid my hands gently
on his injured side.  I blessed the healing process and encouraged him
to trust that he would feel better.  Once I finished, he got up and
apparently did feel much better.</p>

<p><p class=dream>We never got another chance to jump on the trampoline;
a large bar was fixed over the trampoline, attached to poles sticking
up at diagonal corners of it.  We began taking the bar down when the
scene shifted.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was looking at a poster and below it was a large 5
gallon bucket filled with candle wax drippings.</p>

                        <p><title>dollars</title>
<p class=date>2:40am CST Monday 20 November 2000</p>

<p><p>Yesterday around 4pm, Jason came over on his way back from Austin
to help sell to Wende the idea of us transferring several dollars to
his brokerage with him as our broker.  I&rsquo;m totally cool with the idea,
but Wende has some reservations.  Anyway, Wende didn&rsquo;t get home until
like 6:30 or 7, so while Jason and I hung out, we looked at pictures
from SWUUSI and Erick&rsquo;s funeral, and he helped me vacuum the living
room and kitchen rug.</p>

<p><p>The funniest stinkiest thing in the world is when I farted and
tried to use the vacuum to suck up the fart smell, but, in Jason&rsquo;s
words, &ldquo;it purified the fart smell and blew it all over the room.&rdquo;  It
was so funny!!!!!  I was in tears laughing.  I had suck a stinky fart
because I basically ate a whole box of cereal Saturday night and
yesterday morning.</p>

<p><p>So Wende and I ate a pizza and Jason ate grapes once Wende got home
and then Jason asked what would be our goal for the money and
described therefore what he would suggest to do with it.  His ideas
were great and Wende and I told him.</p>

<p><p>Once he left, I didn&rsquo;t bring it up at all for at least 30 minutes,
but then finally asked how she felt.  Wende said she felt very pushed
and even felt angry on her way home from work knowing that Jason was
going to be here.</p>

<p><p>At that moment, I vowed, &ldquo;fuckit; I won&rsquo;t say another word about
it,&rdquo; but then realized that wouldn&rsquo;t really help the situation.  The
money needs to be moved to a more aggressive income vehicle.  So I
told her my initial reaction and subsequent thoughts.</p>

<p><p>Then I got to hear more of the source of Wende&rsquo;s inaction - that
she feels guilty moving the money away from our current person with
the reasoning, &ldquo;because you&rsquo;re not investing aggressively enough,&rdquo;
when the truth is, Wende has asked him to invest more aggressively.</p>

<p><p>Ahhh.  That makes sense.  I told her that I would have no problem
calling him and asking to move the money.  I&rsquo;ll offer to ask him to
change the strategy, but I know in my mind I already think that&rsquo;s not
going to work.</p>

                        <p><title>Cold and wet</title>
<p class=date>8:00am CST Saturday 18 November 2000</p>

<p><p>I would almost call the weather outside &ldquo;blustery,&rdquo; but the wind
seems quite consistent and not too strong.  but the cold wet rain
certainly does its part to make outside a place I don&rsquo;t want to be
right now.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m going to be working on my new days old thing.  I haven&rsquo;t
sketched out a plan for what I want to do.  This might be foolish, but
not more foolish than other things I&rsquo;ve done.</p>

<p><p class=date>08:51am</p>

<p><p>I have this big giant perl book: <em>Perl Annotated Archives</em>,
and it&rsquo;s so big and clunky and the funtions, etc, are described only
in terms of how they work in this example, as opposed to describing
them individually and <em>then</em> using them in an example, that I don&rsquo;t
like using the book.</p>

<p><p>However, my happy <em>Learning Perl</em> by O&rsquo;Reilly &amp; Associates,
also known as The Llama Book, for its cover, isn&rsquo;t handy.  I did a
brief and <em>soooper quiet</em> examination of the rooms in the
house, but didn&rsquo;t find it.  I looked in my car in the garage and
didn&rsquo;t find it.  &ldquo;I probably left it at work,&rdquo; thought I.  &ldquo;But
maybe,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;just maybe,&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s in Wende&rsquo;s truck.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>So I got her keys and bundled up in my hoodie and ran out the front
door (instead of opening the garage door, which would have been much
louder), and ran through the dreary weather to Wende&rsquo;s truck.  Opened
the truck and found my book!  Yay!!!!!</p>

<p><p>Very happy camper.</p>

<p><p class=date>09:07am</p>

<p><p>Oh my god.  I just saw several snowflakes.  I call them flakes, but
maybe snow dots or snow teeny tiny bits would be more appropriate.
When the wind adjusts in just the right manner, a few flakes, instead
of falling like the rest of the rain, floated up toward my window in a
very non-falling manner.  The wind isn&rsquo;t strong enough to loft the
raindrops like that.  The trees are just gently waving like a spring
afternoon.</p>

<p><p>No, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not snow now.  Snowflakes are big when the
weather is warm, and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s below freezing out there.  I
know that Houston often gets rain that had been snow in the clouds,
but it melts on the way down.</p>

<p><p>Well, no, I&rsquo;m seeing it again.  Little bitty somethings acting in a
most snow-like manner.</p>

<p><p>Hmmmmmmmmm</p>

<p><p class=date>9:19am</p>

<p><p>Cool.  I just got my <a href="/cgi-local/days/daysold.pl">days
old</a> counter to use the system date for the Stop values.  Awesome.</p>

<p><p>Oh, and today is Tammy&rsquo;s 31st birthday.  Happy Birthday, Tammy!</p>

<p><p>Tammy was my first real girlfriend, who lived with me for some
years, determined she was lesbian, and has moved to Virginia.</p>

<p class=date>6:02pm CST Saturday 18 November 2000</p>

<p><p>While putting her pizza in the oven tonight, Wende burned her hand.
Ow!!!  I had her put her hand in the sink into which I dumped our
entire ice maker worth of ice.  After about 6 minutes when she really
complained about that, I called Dude&rsquo;s wife Veronica, an MD.</p>

<p><p>Veronica answered, &ldquo;hello?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Uh, yes, may I speak with Doctor Cutie, please?&rdquo; (*)</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;HI Veronica; this is Rob,&rdquo; and I explained the situation to her
and she explained that we don&rsquo;t have to submerge the whole hand in ice
water, but just putting an ice pack on it should be enough. (**)</p>

<p><p>Wende said, &ldquo;seee???? I told you so.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Better safe than sorry.  When I reached my hand into the ice to let
the water out, I was all, &ldquo;man that&rsquo;s <em>cold!!</em>&ldquo;</p>

<p><p>(*) Dude calls Veronica &ldquo;Doctor Cutie.&rdquo;</p>

<p class=date>9:44pm CST Saturday 18 November 2000</p>

<p><p>Wow!  Right after I spoke on the air the first time tonight,
Madeline called!  &ldquo;Rob!  I just heard you on the radio!!&rdquo;  She
apparently had no idea that I would be on, and I haven&rsquo;t talked to her
in a pretty long time, but I&rsquo;m sure she knew I was a DJ - she just
didn&rsquo;t know about this shift.  I had her on speakerphone during most
of my show.  She wasn&rsquo;t on the air, but was a very quiet listener
while I was speaking on mic and she was on speakerphone and <em>could</em>
have spoken, but she was quiet for me.</p>

<p><p>I got several calls from two different guys who have similar
voices, but one call is from 281 area code and the other was from on
campus.  They requested songs and the other would say &ldquo;hey great
song&hellip;&rdquo;  Pretty funny.  They were both quite complimentary of my show
tonight.</p>

<p><p>The show overall was pretty fun and good I think, but I didn&rsquo;t
really listen to most of it; I was talking to Madeline most of the
time and busy writing down song names and announcing them over the
air.  I called Wende during my show to check up on her and her hand.
She said it really hurts.  She got some Neosporin with pain medication
in the gel.  Good good.  I&rsquo;m glad.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m going to work some on my days old counter I think.  I&rsquo;d like to
have it read and write cookies to remember people&rsquo;s requested dates.</p>

<p><p>Uh oh.  I&rsquo;m in trouble for my cereal eating technique.  I left the
cereal out, used another bowl (I had a bowl of cereal before KTRU),
left both bowls in the sink.  Lemme go run down and give smooches to
Wende.</p>

<p class=date>6:19pm CST Saturday 18 November 2000</p>

<p><p>Wende and I watched <em>The Grinch</em> today at 3pm.  We were all
&ldquo;aww man&rdquo; cause about 50% of the audience was between 2 and 8 years
old.</p>

<p><p>However, we got great seats because we were in the screening room
30 minutes early.  AND, once the movie started there was not a single
interrupting peep from anyone in the theater!!  I was totally amazed.
Really - there were probably 300 people there.  Wow.  Thank you, quiet
people!!</p>

<p><p>So, the movie was pretty durn good too.  Carrey as The Grinch got
to show off many of his vocal and facial talents without being gross
or stupid.  The set was astonishingly great and imaginative.  I really
liked it.</p>

<p><p>now it&rsquo;s time for KTRU!!  7pm to 9pm tonight!  I imagine we are
somewhat nearing the end of the semester, but I&rsquo;m not sure exactly
when it ends.  I&rsquo;m also not sure if I&rsquo;ll sign up for an actual shift
or just be available for substitute DJ slots.  Interesting to see my
interest tapering off.</p>

<p class=date>11:21pm CST Friday 17 November 2000</p>

<p><p>Special super wonderful thanks to Maggie for buying dinner and
Charlie&rsquo;s Angels tickets for all of us tonight!!  Will, Molly, Maggie,
me, and Wende all met at Denny&rsquo;s for some dinner before watching
<em>Charlie&rsquo;s Angels</em>.  We loved it!  Wende and I still loved it
even the second time, and Will and the twins loved it as much as we
did.</p>

<p><p>After the movie we played &ldquo;Who would you take a shower with?&rdquo;
game.  The winner for Wende was Lyle Lovett.  For Will was Lucy Liu
(though he said it could change tomorrow).  For me we didn&rsquo;t quit
playing once they got to Carrie Anne Moss (Trinity from <em>The
Matrix</em>).  We of course started with same gender people.  For Will
it was Brad Pitt.  Wende was recent Madonna for a while and I don&rsquo;t
remember who past that.  For me they couldn&rsquo;t think of any guy I&rsquo;d
choose over Michael Jordan.</p>

<p><p>Right now, for me I would definitely choose Drew Barrymore.</p>

<p><p>Right now for real, it&rsquo;s bedtime.</p>

<p><p>(Thanks everyone for such a great fun night!!!)</p>
