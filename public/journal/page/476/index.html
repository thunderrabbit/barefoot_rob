<p>FUCK!!!</p>

<p>Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck</p>

<p>Chad just played the most most most <em>AMAZING</em> mix of three
songs - two vinyl and 1 CD, two spoken word, one played at 45 rpm
(designed for 33) and the CD was Mumia Abu-Jamal the political
prisoner and it sounded so fucking incredible!!</p>

<p>And it wasn't being recorded.  So pissed I was to discover that I
had fucked that up somehow.  How?  Sad that it has been released to
the universe - if only we could travel super duper fast like superman
with a radio and cassette recorder and catch it.  Need to go about to
the asteroid belt instantly I think to catch up with the signal.</p>

<p>Sigh.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class=date>8:01pm</p>

<p>I'm feeling better; Chad just did another magic three source mix
that sounded pretty rad, except he kinda fucked up the end by hitting
START/STOP on the turntable (which stops it abruptly) instead of
turning it off to let it slow down super slowly.</p>

<p>And this time it was recorded.</p>

<p class=date>9:04pm</p>

<p>Jonathan came to KTRU!!!!!!  Just because it was my last show, he
came <em>on his bike</em> and <em>in the rain</em> to come see me!!</p>

<p>Now I took a chance playing two different sources: Star Trek at 45
and the pitch all the way up, with some hip hop in the background
(Latyrx)</p>

<p class=date>11:21pm</p>

<p>So my final shift is over.  I stayed a bit late because Liz, the
next DJ was flooded out.  Ashley came in to cover for her.  Thanks to
him and his girlfriend for making the trek in the rain.</p>

<p>I'm actually at Kinko's now, and who is here but the production
crew from Wreckshop Records producing <em>Dirty Third II</em>.
Swa'vet invited me to pull up a chair, which I'll do for a bit after I
send email and such.</p>

                        <p class=date>10:17am CDT Saturday 13 July 2002</p>

<p>Today has been busy with packing and sorting through stuff for my
garage sale today.  So far, no one has visited.</p>

<p>This week, as opposed to last week, I'm much more at peace, and
much more excited, and barely scared about how it's all going to come
together.</p>

<p>The apartment is as good as rented, and I've had two new phone
calls today asking after it.  One guy I will call back on Monday if
the apartment is not rented by then.</p>

<p>Have piled together another set of boxes for Maggie to store; she
will come by to visit after she and Meredith check out the Titanic
exhibit at Fine Arts Museum.</p>

<p>I made a phone call to Fred to see if he wanted my Rubik's Revenge
(5x5x5 cube).  He was all, "definitely, and what about your CDs?" and
I read through my CD titles over the phone and he said either
"definitely," "yes," or "uhh, sure" to about 60 of them.  He'll give
me $100 for them and offered to sell them all back to me for the same
price.  Awesome.</p>

<p>Spot has curled up onto my lap, making it difficult to type, so I
put the computer on his back legs and he's fine with that, practically
sleeping.  But the phone is far away; I'll choose to get up if someone
calls.</p>

<p class=date>10:37am</p>

<p>Make that three calls about the apartment, and two guys to call if
it's still available.</p>

<p class=date>11:03am</p>

<p>Roy just dropped off some newspaper that I can use for packing
material for my ceramic plates and such.  Excellent!</p>

<p class=date>12:40pm</p>

<p>I'm slowly running out of enthusiasm toward packing.  I've packed
my plates, have sorted through more stuff, cleaned wax off of brass
candlesticks, put water in the freezer to make ice for my trip, talked
to Jason, Amy, Jennifer trying to get rid of some furniture.  Jason
may pick up recliner and futon tomorrow.  Jennifer asked after my
three drawer filing cabinet.  I'm surprised Dude and Veronica haven't
made it by yet.</p>

<p>Talked to Kristen to figure out a time to say HI before we
scatter.  Asked Jason if I can live with him mid to late August, and
maybe work with him at his restaurant that he's managing.  (Oh, there
was a disagreement of sorts at the restaurant in Wimberley, so he's no
longer the owner of a restaurant by the river.  Good experience for
him overall I hope.)</p>

<p>Have emailed Laura to see if I can live with her near Beaumont in
early September.</p>

<p>Still plodding along, and things are taking shape.  Stil haven't
really thought about how/what clothes to pack.</p>

<p class=date>3:19pm</p>

<p>Just after 2pm, Marcel and Adrien came to visit.  Adrien
entertained himself with tape mostly and shredded paper near the end
of their visit.  Maggie and Meredith came as well, bearing pizza from
Star!  Maggie scooped up five more boxes, and Meredith will likely be
able to help me get my coins counted in my glass jar.  I'm not 100%
sold on the idea, but I think it will be beneficial to have the cash
in my account, and begin filling the jar again later.  I can even buy
rolls and rolls of coins to begin with the same amount of money that's
in their now.</p>

<p>I'm really thankful to Maggie for holding so much of my stuff.
She, by far, has the greatest volume of my stuff archived.</p>

<p>The weather seems poised to dump some rain on us soon.  But
interestingly either the storm was smaller than I thought (square
miles) or it's lighter in one section that it seemed before.  Anyway,
it will either rain or not soon.</p>

<p>I just purchased cassette tapes to record my last KTRU show for a
while.  I think it will be quite fun because Chad will be there and
he's a funny mofo.</p>

<p>Up a bit late, helping Swa'vet a bit with her copy of the script,
mostly listening to their discussions, somewhat talking to Logan, son
of Stephan (who encouraged me to get a camera), since Logan was bored
senseless.  They had been here since 5pm.</p>

<p>The most unique thing I've done today was play tennis with Amy in
the street in front of her house.  I had been at Container Store
getting some boxes, and the wondered what time her tennis match is
tonight.  I didn't want to use a phone call, so I just drove over to
her house.  She asked if I wanted to bonk some tennis balls around and
we did.</p>

<p class=date>7:15pm</p>

<p>Now I'm with Steve, Amy's husband, watching her play tennis at some
tennis place in southwest Houston.  I <em>think</em> she is beating
this woman, but I'm not totally sure.  Okay, I'm pretty sure Amy is
winning.</p>

<p>There's not a lot of people watching relative to the number of
players, but I guess that is a result of what level is this
competition.  It's one step down from the state level.</p>

<p>My cell phone was turned to silent, but when Wende called, I
noticed and pulled it out of my pocket and discovered consciously that
it was ringing.  cool.</p>

<p class=date>7:27pm</p>

<p>Amy won the first thingie.</p>

<p class=date>8:38pm</p>

<p>Amy didn't win the second and third thingies; the other Amy won
instead.</p>

<p>Team is showing lots of love.</p>

<p>I found out this morning that my apartment is as good as leased to
a guy named Will.  He's the first person who called me after I placed
the ad with Houston Chronicle.</p>

<p>Been talking to the super funny Celeste at my insurance company, to
get my car insurance separated from Wende's.  She told me a great
story about her adventures at Katy Mill's Mall while she was visiting
Houston last year.  Fun stuff!</p>

<p>She said she has a headache though, and all her co-worker-peeps
were hollering in the background since one of them was getting
transferred to a different location and they were throwing a see ya
later party.</p>

<p>My last GenXchange meeting (for a while) went well.  We persuaded
Jose' to be president and Cynthia to be Treasurer to cover my and
Wende's officer positions.</p>

<p>Gerald and I tossed a squishy baseball back in forth like two
school kids sitting in the back of the classroom as if no one could
see us.  I didn't think quickly enough to get a picture of him
reaching <em>way</em> back tilting precariously backwards in his chair
to reach the ball behind him on the floor.  Good stuff.</p>

<p>There was a kitchen fire near the end of the meeting in one of the
apartments.  Jose' and Tim luckily did not get ticketed though they
parked in a fire lane and there was a cop car right behind them
responding to the fire.  Crazy.</p>

<p>Wende and I talked some afterward, tried to figure out a time we
can make sure I don't have any of her stuff in my apartment before
Crazy Rob's Everything Must Go sale starting Saturday and accelerating
madly till next Friday or even more madly if someone moves in sooner
than that.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, it looks like someone will take my apartment in
time.  I had three calls today, and one guy who apparently turned in
the credit application today.  I'm super duper uber thankful for
that.</p>

<p>I just visited my dentist; $88 for a cleaning. Chatted with Marsha
and Dr C (Chisholm); told him of my upcoming adventures.  He's one of
the people who bolstered my confidence about going to Europe - or
really encouraged me to go.  Excellent customer service; tell them I
sent you and get $25 off your initial visit!  713-781-3700 is their
number.</p>

<p>Now I'm at Oak Forest Automotive getting
Scott's air conditioning looked at and his little oil leak fixed.</p>

<p>Called Daniel to come pick me up, but he wasn't available; left a
message.</p>

<p class=date>10:03am</p>

<p>Still at Oak Forest; Daniel hasn't called me.  But I've been
writing emails, so it's alll good.  And talking to Buffy at Oak
Forest, trying to negotiate how to pay $600 to get my A/C fixed.  It's
never really worked since I got the car.  But I think I might like it
to work when I begin my adventure.</p>

<p class=date>4:23pm</p>

<p>Still at Oak Forest.  Daniel called while Buffy, Myra and I were on
our way back from Souper Salad.  He was apologetic, and I enjoyed the
irony since I had forgotten our first engagement.</p>

<p>Scott is almost done.  I took an hour nap until 4pm.  They have his
glove compartment out and a radiator thing out from behind that.  Not
tooo deep, but enough that I'm glad I don't have to know how to do
it.</p>

<p class=date>4:47pm</p>

<p>Gracie and Ellie are playing Elmo's playhouse on the computer.
Interesting to watch Ellie, 2 years old, not quite understanding that
she can't interface with Elmo without using the mouse (yet, witness
<em>Minority Report</em> I think).</p>

<p>Elmo can be fed unlimited cupcakes in this game.  Very
interesting.</p>

<p class=date>4:57pm</p>

<p>I'm quite aware of differences between how I saw Christina
interacting with Mia, versus Terry (sp) interacting with her daughter
Ellie.</p>

<p>As I walked in around 5:15, after having purchased a 99 cent
chicken sandwich at Jack in the Box, Buffy gave me some news:</p>

<p>"We have a problem.  There is another blockage in your air
conditioning system, and they don't know what it is.  We can either:
keep your car for one more day, and maybe have to replace the
compressor, or we can put all your old parts back on and not charge
you anything."</p>

<p>"How much is a compressor?"</p>

<p>She looked up the part she needed and called her distributor.
While Buffy was on the phone getting a price, David came in from the
garage, "we got it!"</p>

<p>"Nevermind,"</p>

<p>It turns out that they were mis-attaching the hose to insert the
freon.  Once it was attached correctly, presto, no more blockage.</p>

<p>Now, after four years in Houston, Scott's AC works.</p>

<p>My day begins again at Kinko's, as it seems to do now lately.
Interesting to think this place is just hoppin with activity 24 hours
per day.  People doing all sorts of stuff from creating movies, to
political advertising, multi-level business building, free internet
mooching..</p>

<p class=date>1:58pm</p>

<p>Have munched lunch with Dude at Mission Burrito; $2 off Que Mas
salad on Tuesdays in July.  Awww yeah.</p>
