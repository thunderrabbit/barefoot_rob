                        <p class=date>12:01am JST Wednesday 5 November 2003</p>

<p>Went back to the park.  Rode Thunder Dolphin again.  This time I
spent a lot of effort thinking of the BEST thing I could do as one
person and two cameras on the coaster.  Lucky for my sleep schedule, I
don't remember the entire train of thought, but I eventually was like,
"okay, if Fred were here, what would we decide is the best thing we
could do?"  and I came up with it.</p>

<p>As I approached the front of the line, I put my GAP hoodie on
backwards.  Then when I was on the train, I pulled the hoodie up over
my head.  Of course, being backwards, my face was completely covered
by a smooth black layer of cloth.  None of this bunched up around the
drawstrings cover-up.  Smooth.  Flat.  Perfect.  Backwards.</p>

<p>This got some laughs from the crowd.  I raised the roof for them.</p>

<p>So for the first picture (which is taken just before we
ascend the lift hill) I was just flat black.</p>

<p>Soon as we started the ascent, I whipped off my hoodie and placed
it on the seat beside me.  The wind tried to loft it from the seat,
but I was able to get it pretty well tucked under the lap bar while
careening around the track.  For the second picture, I was smiling
bigly, wearing a white (1998 San Antonio Rally) shirt, pointing over
to my friend Mr Nobody wearing a hoodie in the seat next to me.</p>

<p>Due to croppage, the hoodie isn't visible, my arm pointing to the
hoodie is hardly visible, and due to being on a roller coaster, my
expression looked a little weird.</p>

<p>But I still got an honor at the photo purchase area.  The photo
purchasing agent can hang little notes "Best Couple" "Super Scream"
"Best Smile" etc.  I got "Splendid" after the guy saw me seriously
examining the screen and noticed ("wait-a-minute; he's wearing a
different shirt!") or just gave me a note to make me happy.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I bought the pictures and upon further analysis, decided that the
idea itself was flawless, but just a little strained in production.
The dark hoodie didn't show up well at night, and the croppage.  Ah
well.   I would simply have to ride again.</p>

<p>But I couldn't do the same poses again.  How weak would that be?
Had to think of new best ideas.</p>

<p>Came up with two awesome ideas.  One requires two people, and we
simply switch shirts during the ride.  This would be best if they were
simply T-shirts, and not a hoodie, which would mean that we were
shirtless during part of the ride, but nobody can *really* say
anything because there's no direct proof.</p>

<p>The other idea requires only one person, but it requires disabling
the safety device on the coaster or learning a different way to switch
seats during the ride.</p>

<p>So instead I did "I'm squeeshing you" for the first picture and
"hmmmmm" for the second picture.</p>

<p>I got "Hey Nice Guy" <em>and</em> "Splendid!" <em>AND</em> my
picture was featured on the monitor showing the latest great picture!
Wow, what a star for a moment.</p>

<p class=date>1:10am</p>

<p>Fuuuuuuuuuuk</p>

<p>It's late.  I just imported all the pics from my camera, rotated
those that need to be rotated, and deleted those that need to be
deleted.  Didn't write anything specific about any of them.</p>

<p>The pics are 1600 x 1200 pixels so I'd have to reduce them before
putting them online; gotta be up early tomorrow (for work; I'm
covering for Carla cause she's covering for me on Monday so I can hang
out with ma)</p>

<p>Who knows when I'll get any pics online.</p>

<p>But I haven't written the most disrupting thing about the evening.</p>

<br>I hope you're covered (workwise) for a week from Monday. It sounded like you traded for this coming Monday. You can probably hang with us then, but we need you even more on the 17th.<br>
<br>
Love you!<br>
<br>
I'm getting excited and nervous, too. Deciding what clothes to bring--is a bright red jacket okay? And how cool is it? The temperature looks fairly warm lately.<br>
<br>
Still a few work related things to finish up before we leave. Just 3 days left to do them!<br>

of First Drop magazine, the bi-monthly mag of the European Coaster
Club <a

He's the cat that asked me if he could use my pics of Hamu-Hamu
Kingdom coaster at Fuji-Q Highland.</p>

<p>Of course yes, and those pics will be published soon.</p>

<p>I sent him the higher res, but rainy pictures of Surf Coaster at
Hakkeijima Sea Paradise today.  I'll write something about it
soon.</p>

<p>Maybe it can be my first published coaster article.</p>

<p> Called her at 5:40 (cause I got off earlier than I thought I
would) and she seemed to be not exactly awake.  So I said no worries;
go to bed kinda thing and then she said she'd be there in 20 minutes,
which would be 6:08.  Fair enough.  She would lose a point by flaking,
but at the same time I released her to flake if she wanted and she
chose not to, so no points lost overall.</p>

<p>We ate (om rice and spaghetti) then walked to Cinecitta and
inquired about tickets to Matrx Revolutions on opening moment.  All
sold out; tickets had gone on sale in mid October.  A lot earlier than
Matrix Reloaded (or was it Pirates of the Carribean?) but
understandable enough.</p>

<p>Zipped over to DICE, the new shopping megabuilding (not mega for the
US, but mega for Japan) which includes 8 screens.  11pm sold out.</p>

<p>But 11:30pm still had seats available.</p>

<p>11:30pm, eh?  Hmmm.  I guess I'd have to get a taxi home.
Hmmm.  I'll call Matty.  If he can go, we'll split the taxi price
home.</p>

<p>No answer from Matty.  (I wonder if he's out with his new love
("the only problem is....  she's a prostitute.") during his last
couple weeks in Japan.)</p>

<p>Hmmm. It's not that far to Tsunashima from here; I could get a
taxi; it's only about</p>

<p><em>oh wait!</em>; I can ride my bike!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>Bang.  Got a ticket.</p>

<p>She can't go that late; she has to be up in the AM on Thursday.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Walked around a bookstore in the DICE building until they closed
around 9pm.</p>

<p>"See you tomorrow.  11:30.  Shinagawa, platform 1, at the end of
the platform."</p>

<p>As they say in Japan, "byebye"</p>

<p>Work wasn't bad today.  I talked with Miki during my last lesson, a
>M&lt; no show.  Asked about her future college plans and such.  She's
not sure what she wants to do about college - go to the US or stay
here.  Lots of factors going into the decision.</p>

<p>I understand completely.</p>

<p>I offered her Satoko's email address, but she didn't seem
interested.  Fair enough.  A bit nervous, maybe.</p>

<p>Got a call during work from a woman that sounded like Miki (the
other Miki), but who I suspected was Tomoko.  I told her I'd meet her
after work at 6pm.</p>

Hello Everybody

--------
Overview

What an amazing past few weeks.  Nearly a month of scattered thoughts
in my brain (should I stay or should I go?), and yet more lofts and
dips in the rollercoastering emotions of my life.

All of this mental activity surrounds the six month mark of my stay in
Japan.  The original first paragraph of this email was written right
at the six month mark:

      I have made it six months in Japan!  It's rare for me to get
      lost beyond comprehension on the trains.  I get lost as in "I've
      never been here before," but I can generally work out how to get
      where I want to go.  Getting lost on the trains used to be my
      compulsion; I'm really happy to have gotten over that.

I was in a world of happy thoughts, having worked at Nova six months
meant I was eligible for vacation.  And that meant I was taking a
vacation with janette.  About Nova I wrote:

      Working at Nova has simultaneously gotten easier and less
      fulfilling for me.  I want to actually really help the students;
      often I think the best way to do that is by not using the Nova
      materials, which I and many students dislike.  I've begun
      telling students to make a fuss about the text if they don't
      like it.  (This is only for higher level students who can
      understand what I'm talking about, of course.)  Japanese seem
      unwilling to make a fuss over anything.  That's part of their
      culture it seems.  Frank (my loudmouth ex-roommate) would tell
      them, "break the rules." I'm not quite so overt, but they would
      never actually break the rules, so it doesn't actually matter.
      (Yes, these are generalizations.)

I wrote that with a huge unwieldy idea in my mind.  I wanted to change
the face of Japanese culture.

I had a Big Idea in my head of saving Japanese from their own culture
by getting Japanese people to express themselves and then actually
*talk* to each other about what is wrong with their country (*). I
have talked to some of my students about it, and they seem to think
such a dialogue would be a good thing.  I have heard, "please save
Japan," from a student (in a group of three) when I suggested the
idea of bringing a technique for dialogue to Japan.

(*) Reads _Dogs and Demons_ for details

From 1997 to 2002, I was an active member of The Mankind Project 
(<a href="https://www.mkp.org">www.mkp.org</a>).  This organization helped me learn and honor my 
inner (mental, emotional, spiritual) workings and taught me how to
live in integrity with myself and with others.

I imagined that if I could bring this concept to Japan, make these
Japanese open up their inner emotions, then that could start a
dialogue that would allow correction of the culture.  Keep it from
imploding and falling to pieces.

In the back of my head I knew that I don't know enough about the
culture yet to be an angel of light and magically bring positive
change across the culture.

As I write this now, I recognize several of the assumptions I have
made about the culture and value judgements I've made about what is
good and what is bad in this world.

As a result, I'm aware that I might not affect profound changes in
Japan.  And that's okay.  But then I come back to the question
"what am I doing here?"

As I re-read the above text, I can hardly follow my own thoughts.
Either it's a poorly written mess, or my brain is a mess, or a
combination of both.

------------------- 
Contacting students

Three weeks ago, I wrote this:

      Against Nova's policies, I have met some Nova students outside
      of school/work.  I assume the policy is designed to keep
      teachers from taking students (read money) from Nova.  After
      talking to more seasoned teachers, I believe I won't be fired
      for seeing students unless it "causes a scene" at Nova.  (So I'm
      careful not to date any students; all of them know I have a
      girlfriend.)  In the past several weeks, I have given my email
      address and/or website address to students who seem interested
      in my idea of bringing the New Warrior Training (<a href="https://www.mkp.org">www.mkp.org</a>) to
      Japan.  I only bring it up during general conversation lessons
      with higher level students who have grown bored with the Nova
      text.  If they are like, "hey that sounds like a good idea," I
      might give them a way to contact me.

Soon after I wrote that, I got an email from a man who I've never met.
He said that a student saw my website and was upset by some of the
content in my journal.  I wondered if this would come back and bite me
in the butt.  When I got back to work after vacation I was basically
told "do not give your website or contact information to
students." Okay.

I haven't hung out with any students lately, but that's just due to
scheduling and being busy.

Vacation

<a href="/images/travel/japan2003-2004/005_janette-trip/index.shtml">https://www.robnugen.com/images/travel/japan2003-2004/005_janette-trip/index.shtml</a>

Vacation with janette was fantastic.

We hung out in some of my Japanese hangouts; I showed her my train
line and the fashion-filled crowds of Shibuya, the large train station
at the Tokyo end of my train line.  We spent some days visiting areas
outside of Tokyo: Hiroshima, Kyoto and Nara.

The atomic bomb dome and museum of Hiroshima haunts the soul and
pleads for peace.  I didn't notice any blaming nor inflamitory
language, but I found it difficult to walk around proudly as an
American, especially at first.  One thing that helped me feel better:
many school age and junior high and high school students seemed to
walk around in the museum with total disregard for their surroundings.
The senior high students were mostly respectful, but the elementary
kids were just wild.  This helped me relax a bit; no one was LOOKING
AT ME; it was just a museum with weird things to look at.  I wrote a
postcard to President Bush asking him to visit Hiroshima instead of
not signing the anti-nuclear treaty.

We were in Hiroshima for only one night, and then we took a shinkansen
(bullet train) to Kyoto, one of the former capitals of Japan.  Kyoto
is often described as preserving "traditional Japan," but
really it's just a large Japanese city built on a grid with a lot of
shrines and temples around the perimeter and hiding in the midst of
the chaotic city.  Janette and I visited Ginkakuji and Kyomizu
temples, and randomly discovered Yoshida shrine on a hill near Kyoto
University.

We discovered a sushi bar and had a great time working to communicate
with the two women working there.  As the only two customers, we had
nearly the full attention of both women.  They offered different types
of sushi, and we basically said yes to every one.  Eight types of
sushi in all.  I wish I had written down the names of each type.. I
can only remember that we had shrimp and scallops and raw tuna
("maguro").  Raw tuna nearly dissolves in my mouth.  Mmmmmm.
What an incredible experience.

Visited Iwatayama area the next day because a monkey was on the map
near there.  "I wanna see some monkeys." No monkeys were to be
found, and I must give kudos to the man at the entrance of the monkey
trail.  "Sumimasen.  Today no monkey." He coulda charged us
five bucks each and let us find out for ourselves.  I appreciate his
integrity.

The surrounding area was quite beautiful even so.  Thick underbrush
and tall trees climbed the hill immediately on our left, and little
bamboo roofs covered various merchants along the river on our right.
Other couples walked along the paved trail at various intervals.  If
not for them, I would have breached the fence and tried climbing the
steep hill.  It looked rather dangerous with fallen rocks attempting
to pile up and over the fence keeping them at bay, but could have been
a lot of fun.

Breaking News

It's been at least a week since I've written/editted the above.  My
thoughts change with each day; moodswings and such keep me wondering
how I could possibly want to leave and how I could possibly want to
stay.

Yesterday, on the day I planned to visit Hakkeijima Sea Paradise, it
rained.  Today it's sunny (even warm) (and I'm wearing a long sleeved
shirt cause it was cold yesterday).  The two weeks before yesterday it
was sunny (not counting my previous weekend, when it rained).  This
seems to epitomize my experience in Japan lately.

After some consideration during the day today, I'm likely to go home
near the end of this year.  That will give me enough time to do some
of the things I want to do here, and not make it unbearably forever
until I leave.  Plus, Janette might come around that time and I can
just go home with her.

--------------------- 
Things to Do in Japan

* Visit Yomiuriland (take super hi-res pics of the coasters) * Visit
Nikko (scheduled for mid November) * Visit the haunted house in Fuji-Q
Highland (hi-res pics) * Recognize that I'm still just a big kid at
heart

---------------------- 
Contacting Students II

Two days ago I traded email addresses with a student who also loves
roller coasters.  We may go visit a park sometime.

---------- 
Kim Sawyer

I have *just* talked to my personal coach Kim Sawyer.  He listened to
my situation and helped me get an overview perspective on it, and
helped me see some small steps I can make to move me toward the
direction I think I want to go.

---------------- 
Overview Part II

I have a big physical-connection-need that is not being met.  Hugs are
not plentiful in Japan.

I'd like to be paid to ride rollercoasters.  Kim suggested some ways I
can work toward that without giving anything up or risking anything
important.

Knowing how my Aries nature likes to start projects but not finish
them, we'll see what happens.

<p>I wonder if I'll make it through the day at work.   Getting up to
shower and such now.</p>

<p class=date>6:57pm</p>

<p>I made it through the day.  My throat was really ucky at the
beginning, but eating some soft food (rice and eggs and cheese
(practically Mexican!) which they call om rice), drinking hot green
tea and two liters of Pocari Sweat, and sucking on throat drops during
class helped.  During my first lesson, I spoke as little as possible,
which is certainly a trick when teaching a spoken language.</p>

<p>I wrote a lot of stuff down, and pointed to various words in
different orders to get him to ask and answer different things.  I
didn't let him ask me too many questions.</p>

<p>By the end of the day, my throat felt nearly happy.</p>

<p>Today I turned in to the video store a video that Frank checked out
but didn't return.  They sent us a couple notices before I found the

<p>I have heard that it's easier for Japanese to express their
emotions in English than in Japanese.  The above thoughts woke me up
with their significance.</p>

<p>At the meeting there would be Japanese written rules, and before
the meeting would be spoken instructions, <em>Whatever is spoken in
this room, stays in this room</em> and <em>you do not have to speak,
but you are welcome to.</em> The same sort of shit that is spoken
before 12 step meetings.</p>

<p>There would be 'definitions' of the basic emotions:</p>

<pre>
Happy:   :-)

Sad:     :-(

Afraid:  :-O

Angry:  >:-&lt;
</pre>

<p>and possibly Japanese sentences that describe the emotions (if that
can be done).</p>

<p>Today I'm going to have my students discuss what is most important to
them and why.</p>
