<p class=date>7:25am CST Friday 17 November 2000
<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>At my dad&rsquo;s work, actually I drove up onto a parking
garage to meet him, and he was using a laptop for work and I updated a
batch login file, but couldn&rsquo;t use all of the editor commands, to
delete two semicolons from the text, I asked my dad to log in and I
told him what needed to be deleted.  He asked me what the code was
doing so I explained it to him and as best I knew how.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I left and was riding a mountain bike and bicycled away
from the city toward Memorial Park bicycle trails and on the way past
a girl and her family.  I had met the girl before from my Castle of
Dreams days, but I didn&rsquo;t really know her all that well.  She and I
said HI, but didn&rsquo;t have much else to say.  As I bicycled away from
her, I carefully listened to her relaying a story that she &ldquo;knew&rdquo;
about me.</p>

<p><p class=dream>&ldquo;He was driving a car with a cooking pot that had a
non-stick surface because that helped him get better speed and his
girlfriend didn&rsquo;t want to have it in the house because the surface was
a bit cracked.  I don&rsquo;t really know his name - it&rsquo;s like Tretcher or
something and I don&rsquo;t know what kind of name that is.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was amused by the story that was based in reality,
but pretty much otherwise inaccurate in the details.  I determined
that I would send her an email to say I had overheard her and to
correct the details.  The name is &ldquo;Thunder&rdquo; not &ldquo;Tretcher&rdquo; and stuff
like that.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I arrived at the muddy woods in Memorial Park and the
first down ramp was ridiculously steep and stair stepped all at once.
I was all &ldquo;No way am I going down that,&rdquo; so I began to ride just
through the muddy (but flat) trail.  The wheel literally was just
spinning out and I joked that I was on a stationary bike, which I
apparently was.  Some other guys were bicycling through a different
part of the trail, so I began to follow them and was actually able to
ride, but the mud certainly made it more difficult.  We rode, yelling
to increase adrenaline and power, turning, riding, push pushing
through the trees until our legs burned with soreness and we were
drenched with sweat.  My new friend grabbed a tall container of
chilled water to drink and I warned him that he shouldn&rsquo;t drink super
cold water when he was super hot.  But he did it anyway. and was
apparently fine.</p>

<p><p>I am the greatest programmer who ever lived.  Check this out:</p>

<p><p>This week I wrote a little perl ditty that calculates how many days old a
body is, and today I finished coding the preliminary version into my
website:  <a href="/cgi-local/days/daysold.pl">here</a></p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m pretty happy with it now, except for a few obvious things that need
to be fixed:
<ol><li>Don&rsquo;t hardcode the dates into the text fields
<li>Get the stop date from system time
<li>Fix the fonts and text some
</ol></p>

<p><p>Not so obvious enhancements:
<ol><li>store cookie on user&rsquo;s machine that will be their birthdate
<li>allow for timezones (this one is exceedingly unlikely to happen soon)
</ol></p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>At work, I have done the most amazing thing for our productivity.
Remember the Ritz Project over which I agonized hours and days and weeks?
Well, we just got Part II of the project, and I wrote the original project
so well that Part II has been a breeze to set up.  Now I just have to create
the question dataset and the ratings dataset to hold the answers to the
questions.  Awww yeah.  It used to be that setting up the question and
ratings datasets took the shortest amount of time for a project, but this
time, everything else in the project took 30 minutes to do.  Setting up the
questions and ratings dataset will probably take a full day.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>Okay, so these accomplishments may not prove I&rsquo;m the greatest programmer
in the world, but I think all programmers should repeat that mantra.</p>

                        <p><title>Defensive Driving</title>
<p class=date>10:14pm CST Thursday 16 November 2000</p>

<p><p>I have a few of the funnies that our stand up comic said yesterday
during comedy defensive driving:</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Can you imagine what it would be like if everyone <em>actually</em> got a
ticket every time they were speeding?  I&rsquo;d be teaching this course
in the Astrodome..&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I was at Southwest Texas for a few years, and I left there
with a .5 GPA&hellip;. I had <em>half</em> an F.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;When I lived in Virginia, I found out they have &lsquo;points&rsquo; that they
add to your diriver&rsquo;s license if you get a ticket.  Just before I got
enough points to lose my license, I moved back to Texas.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Some people try to go through the blinking red light when it&rsquo;s off.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>On a long roadtrip:</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Dad, I gotta go!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Grab the 2 liter.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Did I say that out loud?  I don&rsquo;t mean to brag.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p> - - - -</p>

<p><p>Those were some of the funnies from last night.  I didn&rsquo;t write any
more from tonight.  At the very end, during the test, some people were
all, &ldquo;what? what?&rdquo; and missing questions and all sorts of ridiculous
stuff.  It made me think, &ldquo;you have a driver&rsquo;s license?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>What really got me today was the video on Road Rage.  I am sure I&rsquo;d
never engage someone physically, but I do get mad and yell easily
while driving.  One of the guys interviewed said that after he
adjusted his thinking / emotions, driving was a much more pleasant
experience for him.  Maybe I&rsquo;ll do that.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I dreamt that 104 KRBE was switched to a different

the station couldn&rsquo;t afford him anymore.</p>

<p class=date>5:57am CST Thursday 16 November 2000</p>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s been raining for some hours I think and it&rsquo;s pouring so
astonishingly much, like a monsoon for Houston.  There is almost no
lightning; I&rsquo;ve only seen it once in about 5 minutes.  There is almost
no wind.  Just dense thick enormous rain.</p>

<p><p class=date>6:10am</p>

<p><p>I just checked our attic for leaks.  There are none and I am
thankful.</p>

<p><p>The street is <em>almost</em> flooded all the way across.  There&rsquo;s
a manhole cover on the street essentially right outside my window, and
the street is a bit lower there.  The water flowing along the curb
therefore extends further across the stree there and is within a foot
of reaching the water along the other curb.</p>

<p><p>Last time I wrote about super dense rain, the curb water didn&rsquo;t
extend past the manhole cover.  Today it does.</p>

<p><p class=date>6:13am</p>

<p><p>Well, that was short lived; the water was receeded so that it no
longer covers the entire manhole.</p>

<p><p class=date>8:37am</p>

<p><p>Now the sky looms with verigated clouds, but no rain right now.</p>

<p class=date>11:50pm CST Wednesday 15 November 2000</p>

<p><p>I attended Part I of II Comedy Defensive Driving course today after
work.  The guy was pretty funny and I took notes on his funniness, but
I&rsquo;m just too tired to relate it all.  I will say, however, that I went
googoo for the cuteness of Drew Barrymore at age 7 or 8 on Johnny
Carson&rsquo;s greatest Moments tape.  Oh my gosh Drew Barrymore is sooooo
CUTE!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p><p>I told Wende that I would only leave Wende for Drew Barrymore.  Not
Tori Amos, not Madonna, not Amanda Peet.  Not even Cameron Diaz.
Well, maybe Cameron Diaz.  I&rsquo;m tired.  Good night.</p>

<p class=date>4:10am CST Wednesday 15 November 2000
<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>At work, 3 different hard drives were removed from
other machines and placed into my computer, so I would have huge
amounts of storage space on my computer.  I got the F and G drives
from our main server and I got the H drive from Kasi&rsquo;s machine.  While
I was erasing all the information from the drives, Drew brushed some
cracker crumbs off my diary that was sitting on my desk or something.
Drew is meticulously clean.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I began stretching while the hard drive was being
cleaned and found myself in a ballet class, just learning a single
knee bend balance thing.  right foot touching the ground on the outer
edge only and left knee supporting the entire body weight and deep
knee bend with left knee and right foot extends out during the deep
knee bend and then back up, with left arm pointed in the air and right
arm out.  We did these over and over and my balance was shaky, but I
was able to do it.  My instructor helped correct my form.  Once I had
done several reps with deep left knee bends, I switched to deep right
knee bends.</p>

<p><p class=dream>In the class was Christine from the dorms at UH (not my
ex girlfriend Christine, but this Chrstine was on the swim team or
maybe track and field) she was in the ballet claass with me and I sat
down behind her and rubbed her back (as I had done many times in the
cafeteria at UH) and told her what a good friend she has been all
these years. (*) She thanked me and told me the story of her band
attending a ntional drum corps competition which is how she got the
drum corps competition sweatshirt she was wearing.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Someone commented that even thought they had a great
competition, the main judge didn&rsquo;t like their show because they had
cussing in it, even though the cussing was not actually spoken, just
implied.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I looked up while rubbing her back and saw a large note
to me written on a poster and taped to the wall.  Something like</p>

<pre>ROB: when you finish the fundraiser,
give the money to _____ and something
something blah blah blah
</pre>

<p><p class=dream>and I thought about how I would show them all and
really make a lot of dough for them in this fundraiser, which
basically amounted to selling cookies or candies to all our friends
and neighbors like a highschool band or choir fundraiser.</p>

<p><p>(*) This Christine I have not spoken to outside of the lunch room
at UH.  Maybe I saw her on campus a couple of times, but we never
dated and I have never been in touch with her since I graduated 5
years ago, except for now in this dream.  I even had to take a few
minutes to think of her name before I got up to write this entry.</p>

<p class=date>11:42pm CST Wednesday 15 November 2000</p>

<p><p>I drove carefully all the way home after defensive driving and
found Laura parked in our driveway.  As I opened the door, the phone
was ringing with Wende on the other end.  Both Laura and Wende were
hungry so we left immediately for dinner.  Black Eyed Pea planned to
close 5 minutes after we arrived at their parking lot, so we visited
La Jaliscience, the best Mexican food within 2 blocks of me an&rsquo;
Wende&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p><p>I confided in Laura just how much I appreciated our relationship
back in 1992, especially in retrospect.  She patted my head, &ldquo;it did a
lot for me too.&rdquo;  It&rsquo;s a good thing Wende arrived just then or I might
have gotten all mushy.</p>

<p><p>We talked about books and the Baytown Tunnel and Chicago and movies
and Drew Barrymore and just had a lovely dinner.  Tiredness quickly
approaching encouraged us all to go home.  We offered our guest
bedroom to Laura, but she chose to stay at her aunt&rsquo;s, as was the
original plan, &ldquo;otherwise, she&rsquo;ll wake up in the morning and wonder
where I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Hugs to Laura and see ya hopefull sooner than later.  Bedtime for
us now.</p>

                        <p><title>paying for ticket, work, mutual funds</title>
<p class=date>9:35pm CST Tuesday 14 November 2000</p>

<p><p>Today before work I decided to just pay the parking lot ticket and
be done with it.  As I entered downtown, I was surprised to see at 6
intersections out of 9 cops directing traffic without regards to the
traffic lights.  Even so, our progress seemed too slow for anyone&rsquo;s
own good.  As I <em>finally</em> reached the street on which I
intended to turn toward the courthouse, I found it was blocked.
GRRR!!!</p>

<p><p>Stupid construction.  I-45 is being shredded and the concrete
debris falling onto the streets below could be hazardous.  Well okay,
it&rsquo;s for the greater good.  I-45 will have a cool new entrance / exit
ramps at Allen Parkway.</p>

<p><p>Finally made it to the courthouse and into the parking lot and
found that one of the &ldquo;paths&rdquo; within the parking lot had been
arbitrarily blocked by cones in order to redirect the traffic flow,
resulting in a dead end that was too tight a squeeze for any car
except maybe a Beetle or one of those European cars to turn around.</p>

<p><p>I found myself blocked, but there was a pickup truck pulling out.
I immediately turned into his space and thought, &ldquo;stupid parking lot&rdquo;
for him when he had to drive backwards after he found himself blocked
by the dead end.</p>

<p><p>Into the courthouse, through the metal detectors (I had to turn on
and off my Visor and open up my collapsible keyboard), and to the
cashier who couldn&rsquo;t dismiss the ticket for no insurance (even though
I have proof of insurance), but sent me to the Annex Court (I was
thankful that this court was just down the hall and not down the
street) for processing.</p>

<p><p>Into room 139 where I was told to be seated; I would be called.  5
or 10 minutes later, I was called by the judge.  He messed up my name
at first, but immediately noticed his error and corrected it and
apologized.</p>

<p><p>He saw my proof of insurance and dismissed that ticket without
question.  Then he asked if I wanted to take defensive driving for the
other ticket.  I said I wanted to, but couldn&rsquo;t because I was taking
DD for my other ticket.  He said that he could give the lowest fine
possible and give me time to pay it.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need time to pay it, but certainly I would appreciate the
lowest possible fine.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well, the fine is not a problem - it would be $40, but the court
costs are $61.50.  The City of Houston is very poor and needs to wring
every penny it can out of its citizens,&rdquo; he halfway joked, &ldquo;so you&rsquo;re
looking at a total cost of $101.50.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>With a half smile, half shake of my head, half <em>oh my fucking
god what a fucked up stupid ass system is this?</em> in my mind, I
conceded, &ldquo;okay.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I sat back down and was soon called back up.  I got the receipt and
it said, among other things, &ldquo;no lo contendre&rdquo; (I think), and &ldquo;Total:
$91.50&rdquo; I looked back to thank the judge for somehow getting me $10
off, but he was talking on the phone and didn&rsquo;t see me.  I don&rsquo;t think
he gave me $10 off, but I imagine either (1) he was wrong about the
court fees, or (2) he told me the cost was more than it was so I&rsquo;d
think I got $10 off.</p>

<p><p>No matter what the case, I paid $91.50 because it also said, &ldquo;If
this is not paid immediately, a warrant will be issued for your
arrest.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I paid it, left the building, paid $2.50 to the parking lot guy,
left the parking lot and went to work.</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>Muttering obscenities to myself on the way into the building,
despite my attempt to see the goodness in the overall situation - that
I had been given a relatively cheap lesson in patience (only $91 as
opposed to the man who never learned patience until he had a stroke),
that I was able to pay it and not have to serve jail time or community
service, blah blah blah.. I still felt mad.</p>

<p><p>Okay, so work was cool - I finished the changes to the Sample
survey on my test machine <a
href="https://rabbit.fsd.nu/sample">here</a>.  I installed a CAT 5
cable so Dennis could move a printer away from the hot exterior window
and closer into the middle of the building.  I asked if the specs for
2 pending surveys had been delivered to us, but they had not, so I
have nothing scheduled for tomorrow.</p>

<p><p>Kevin may have me work with Dave on the project he&rsquo;s working on,
and right now I really don&rsquo;t want to do that - I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll get too
frustrated with Dave&rsquo;s coding style, etc.  We&rsquo;ll see what happens.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>After work Wende and I met at Taco Bell and munched, then home
where I transcribed old journal entries and she talked to her pregnant
sister Stacy about holiday plans.  We reviewed some mutual fund sheets
that Jason mailed to us.  I&rsquo;m ready to invest several dollars into a
fund, but Wende wants to do more research.  I really don&rsquo;t know how to
evaluate mutual funds except to see their past performance, so we are
going to ask 3 different brokers (Jason, Wende&rsquo;s current broker, and a
random broker) what mutual funds they suggest given our current
parameters and then we&rsquo;ll make a decision after that.</p>

<p><p>Time for b-e-d bed.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>At some event, I was trying to take some artistic
pictures with the lighting all dark at the same time this guy was
asking if Wende and I wanted to join him and his group for some kind
of party or something.  I explained that we were very much homebodies
and don&rsquo;t really &ldquo;go out&rdquo; that much.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was standing on a ladder and the group was asitting
in a circle, painting or doing something artistic.  I was standing on
the bottom rung of this tall step ladder, and used the frame of the
ladder to hang the camera and take pictures.  I actually took 1
picture and the exposure was too long so I tried to shut the shutter
with my hand.  I realized the flash had to be on, yet disabled so the
camera would think there&rsquo;s enough light for the photo.  I was grouchy
because I thought I had more frames of film on this 24 exposure roll,
but it was on 25 and I could only get one more out of it.  I thought
this roll was only on number 15 or so.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was helping Everlast from House of Pain write lyrics
for an anti-racist CD.  He was writing something out - ideas in his
head and wrote them out in pictures instead of words and read them to
the group.  The images - heiroglyphics if you will - were so well
drawn so quickly - I was amazed.  A cat for &ldquo;functional&rdquo; and the cat
was drawn in 3D with shading and everything.  He could just write the
pictures in his head faster than writing the words.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Our group argued for a bit about how people in a desert
area would use the word sand instead of land.  Finally we came up with
the following lyrics</p>

<pre>
Land by Land
Sand by Sand
Sea by Sea
Oh you better pack it up and leave
we want this land from sea to sea
we'll kick your ass all over the grass
and so forget the peace

we'll rape your women and kill your kids
cause that's just what we already did

watch your back as you go away
we might just kill you anyway
</pre>

<p><p class=dream>Those were my lyrics describing Europeans slaughtering
the people who lived on this land first.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Then the environment turned into a rally and Frank R
from OKC was there and Austin R.</p>

<p><p>I woke myself up so I could write down these amazing (haha) song
lyrics that I made up with Everlast.</p>
