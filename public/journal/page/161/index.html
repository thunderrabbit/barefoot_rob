<pre><code>Thank you for sending the lesson notes!  I'm glad you like yesterday's
lesson style.  I hope to give all of you more speaking time!  If you
think of any activities which might be fun, feel free to let me know.
:-)

I will be thinking of ways to make the lessons more interesting.
one idea I have is to break up in pairs..  I think we should mix
up the pairs each time so we have different partners each time.
</code></pre>

<p>Mayumi noticed the lesson yesterday was slightly different than ones I
taught last year.  I made fewer corrections and encouraged more
practice speaking.  Only trick is that the students are at different
levels, so I need to take that into consideration.</p>

<pre><code>At this point, I've only solved one puzzle.  I tried briefly to solve
one of the others, but was unable to do so after a few minutes.

But, more importantly, yes you guys certainly made great progress on
the one I finished for you!  It's a variant of one of my grandad's old
puzzles.  In a way, it's mathematically a variant of the round black
puzzle I showed you (with pegs that move in and out).


Regarding the puzzle, actually that one is the most difficult!  I was
able to solve the long chain puzzle in about 3 minutes, and I solved
the butterfly-looking puzzle in about 6 minutes.  The last one I still
haven't fully solved!  (I'm trying to get the puzzle back to its
starting position, but can only get about 1/8th of the way there.
(1/8 is my estimate, but if I understand the puzzle correctly, I'm
certainly not more than 1/4 of the way there, and I could be as far as
1/16th!  I believe you guys had it between 3/4ths to 7/8ths solved!)
</code></pre>

<p>The puzzles were apparently from a 100 yen shop.  They&rsquo;re still neat
and different than puzzles I&rsquo;ve seen before.</p>

<p>The easiest one is similar to a linked horseshoes puzzle.</p>

<p>The second easiest features some rings wrapped / trappe on a curvy wire frame.</p>

<p>I still haven&rsquo;t solved the last one.  I&rsquo;m 99% sure it requires recursion.</p>

<p class="dream">In my men's group, we were asked to organize some
images based on how important they were to us, and it was supposed to
give some insights on our character.  When it was my turn to do it,
only a few of the cards have images.  I kept looking at them and
trying to figure out what was wrong.  The people asked me and I said
"this is a dream so the cards have changed" but I didn't wake up or
otherwise become lucid.</p>

<p>Oh man I just cried a bit after watching Bryn speak Vietnamese in a
video produced by the Consul General for Ho Chi Minh City.</p>

<p>Bryn was <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> my age when we joked about it back in 1996 or so.  Now
she&rsquo;s twice my stature and I realize my self limiting beliefs suck
more cocks than Apple.  Fuck I&rsquo;m so stupid.</p>

<p>How ironic that just last night I wrote a note that I&rsquo;m learning a lot
(related to Amazon Web Services) after talking to them for 1.5 hours
about an issue I&rsquo;m seeing on our server.</p>

<p>I spoke on the phone for 1.5 hours to a guy at AWS support.  He was
patient, understanding, helpful, and many other things that I
appreciated.  He summarized the convo for me, pasted below with some
parts redacted:</p>

<pre><code>Hi,

Thanks for contacting AWS Premium Support. It was a pleasure to speak
with you today in relation to the errors your clients encountered when
accessing your website CB.

I understand in the call that you have set up a Cloudfront
distribution point to serve the requests when users are requesting
images, and it is using ELB (redazzle) as its origin. Meanwhile, your
clients are uploading images to fileswarm.net which is pointing to
your ELB, and in turn images are stored on your backend instances. You
mentioned that in the past 3 days, between 5:00pm and 9:00pm GMT+9,
your clients were seeing some HTTP errors when accessing your website,
but you haven't capture the exact errors they were seeing.

You mentioned that the issues also appeared when uploading the images,
then I started troubleshooting on ELB because this traffic didn't go
through Cloudfront. I notice a few ELB HTTP 5XX errors, and some
spikes on the Max latency which almost reached to 60 seconds, which is
the default timeout value defined on the ELB.

You've enabled the ELB access log so we can have the exact ELB HTTP
5XX errors next time similar issue happens again. From the ELB access
log, you can also see the source IP, requested URL, HTTP response
code, etc. You also have enabled the parameter in Apache configuration
on the backends to record the time used to process the requests. As we
can see in the screenshare, with these information in hand, you can
cross check them to see why some requests are taking longer to be
processed, or not be able to be processed.

ELB HTTP 5XX errors
(link)

Max latency
(link)

Healthyhostcount
(link)

What I missed in the call is that you could also enable Access logs on
CloudFront, which will record the data of customers' requests as well
as the responses, and of course, any errors will be shown there as
well.

So next time when the issues happens, you can try to access the
image/upload the image to your website, and since they are traversing
through different paths, you will be able identify where the issue
resides, and use the logs above mentioned to further troubleshooting
the issue.

Lastly, below are the links we used to enable the %T parameter in
Apache, as well as how you could interpret the information recorded in
ELB access log.

I hope you will find above information helpful, if you need any
further assistance, please feel free to contact us again anytime, we
will be delighted to help you further.

Best regards,

<p>I woke up early (compared to when I went to sleep) because I had some
ideas for doing automated testing.  I guess there&rsquo;s no harm in adding
some CSS classes to make finding things easier.  I may even add a
click all that are unselected option if I can&rsquo;t figure out how to do
it with CasperJS.</p>

<p>But first I gotta repair a script which runs every 5 minutes via cron.
It doesn&rsquo;t run on my local machine, so I missed it after updating the
DB.</p>

<p>By far the large part of my time today was spent in a bit of a panic
trying to figure out why the AB site was acting horribly wrong.  Not
even the most basic thing was working: logged in users couldn&rsquo;t sort
nor even filter the properties.  Yikes stripes!</p>

<p>I was really close to a major upgrade which was alllllmost working on
my local system.  I got it finished and then spent over an hour
testing, and then push the whole thing to live site.</p>

<p>I checked the live site and the problem was still there!  Holy crap
crap crap crap what is going on?????</p>

<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll tell ya: I had wiped a record associated with my login
account, so a JOIN was returning null.  I recreated the record and the
site worked fine.</p>

<p>Whew.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t actually know how the record was removed, but I didn&rsquo;t see any
other users who were affected, so I&rsquo;m going to ignore that pesky
little detail for now.</p>

<p>But.</p>

<p>All of this inspired me to look again at testing systems.  I have
looked at Selenium more than three times and have never been able to
properly install the thing, much less get started with tests.  But
today I found two awesome test systems: <a href="https://ghostinspector.com">https://ghostinspector.com</a> and
<a href="https://casperjs.org/">https://casperjs.org/</a></p>

<p>Ghost Inspector is suuuuper easy to use.  I was able to set up a few
tests on the live site in about an hour.  The most difficult part was
figuring out how to compare two values on the page.</p>

<p>Do it like this:</p>

<p><a href="//b.robnugen.com/journal/2016/ghost_inspector_comparing_values_2016-01-05_at_3.01.19_AM.png"><img src="//b.robnugen.com/journal/2016/thumbs/ghost_inspector_comparing_values_2016-01-05_at_3.01.19_AM.png" alt="Ghost Inspector can compare values" /></a></p>

<p>Casper takes a bit longer to work out how to write the tests, but it
has the awesome advantage of running locally, so it can access my
websites running on my machine.</p>

<p class="lucid">I knew i was able to fly, and determined that I would beat the effects
of gravity, I tried various things to lift off the ground.  Then I
found that looking up allowed me to fly up; this
was great!  I was able to control my flight, even able to fly around in a small
space.  I was able to break through some walls repeatedly, and finally
the roof opened up for me.</p>

<p>I hadn&rsquo;t previously been able to fly so close to the
ground without being attracted to it.</p>

<p class="lucid">I didn't really go anywhere <i>per se</i> but I flew
along the highway for a bit.</p>

<p class="dream">In a room near the kitchen, teaching a lesson, I came
back in to the kitchen and found Kevin's phone was on the counter,
still connected. I remembered I had called him accidentally but it
must not have hung up.  I picked it up all "hello" and he immediately
goes "hello!  Who's been listening to my conversations?"</p>

<p class="dream">"No one! I called you by mistake a while ago. I was
in the other room teaching a lesson."</p>

<p class="dream">He goes, "hmm"</p>

<p class="dream">I didn't know what else to say, but realizing it was
a dream, I just woke up.</p>

<p>Minecraft made some neat edges between Chicago and the mainland.  I
then used MCEdit to delete some chunks which were then recreated in
game.  Interesting results resulted.</p>

<p>I still like it.  Lin seems to still like it.</p>

<p>The refrigerator space is 75cm wide, and 60cm deep on the door side
(next to stove + sink counter), and 90cm deep on the hinge side.</p>

<p>Living+dining room is like 300cm by 650cm overall, with about 3x3
meters for each space.</p>

<p>Lin spoke with builder, who is also the agent.  I want to ask him</p>

<pre><code>What was the original price of the house?
Are house values over the last 10 years trending up in this area?
Are these cracks anything to worry about?
</code></pre>
