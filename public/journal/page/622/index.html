<p><p><em>Dreamt I was sitting with YRUU peeps, looking through the
ultimate YRUU mugbook ever compiled.  Hundreds and hundreds of YRUU
youth pictures and all of them labeled by name.</p>

<p><p>Looking through them with me was Bryn, who knows tons of youths&rsquo;
names.  We quizzed each other, and gleefully pointed out names of
peeps that we&rsquo;re close to. We didn&rsquo;t get very far: Moonfrog, Alva and
her brother Sam.  &hellip;  then I woke up.</p>

<p class=note>(transcribed from 
<a href="https://www.geeky-boy.com/cgi-bin/bbs_thingie">BBST</a>)</p>

<p><p>My weekend was super excellent!  I celebrated my 11,000th day on Saturday.</p>

<p><p>Ultimate frisbee tournament in the morning (we won (no, the other team did not let us win because it was my special day)).  The field was drenched, nay soaked, nay great puddles of standing water after our rains.  There was plenty of grass, so it wasn&rsquo;t ridiculously muddy everywhere, although  muddy enough for a good team muddy picture after the game. (not scanned yet)</p>

<p><p>I got a couple of injuries, including mud jammed up my big toenail and kinda lifted it, and a cut on my big toe cuticle (same toe), and a minor skinned knee. (I play barefoot)  Oh, and a couple of splinters in my feet.  I only felt two splinters, which Wende removed Saturday evening, along with 12 other splinters which I did not feel.</p>

<p><p>After ultimate, the official celebration of my 11,000th day began.  I met at UH my friends Maggie and Molly (twins) and their respective husbands John and Will.  (We were all best buds in college at UH; we are even closer now)  We played a round of disc golf on the time honored course that has been played on campus for years.  Such super great fun.  The course basically makes a huge circuit around campus&hellip;  a disc golf campus tour.</p>

<p><p>We had a good spread of scores.  Will had 70, me 74, John 94, Molly 105, and Maggie 115.  (Disc golf is like golf golf, but we use frisbees instead of golf balls and statues, etc instead of golf holes.)</p>

<p><p>After golf, we hung out at my house for a bit to shower before watching GLADIATOR.  The movie was gory and bloody and  good story, with emotional highs and lows (mostly lows).  Good surround sound too.  Phil joined us for the movie and sat beside me.  He shared his Reeses Pieces and we made jokes at various things on screen (mostly not during the movie, but in the ads beforehand and at people&rsquo;s names in the credits).   Maggie sat on the other beside me, and filled me in on a scene which was just too brutal for me at the moment and I did not watch.</p>

<p><p>Um, then Oh!!  Star Pizza, the best best pizza in Houston (I won&rsquo;t go head to head against Chicago, but definitely the best in Houston and probably Texas).  Olivia was our waitress, whom we called by name a lot and were either very bothersome to her or very friendly&hellip;.  Mostly Molly dominated the conversation, answering our questions about Rome (she was a history major).  All very fascinating stuff.</p>

<p><p>After pizza, across the street to Amy&rsquo;s Ice Creams, where a cute girl server was wearing a little bonnet with cow ears and a cow bell.  I usually get Double Vanilla with M&amp;Ms mixed in.. but this day they had Vanilla Oatmeal Raisin Cookie flavor ice cream, in which I had them mix M&amp;M&rsquo;s.</p>

<p><p>Totally gorged on pizza and sugar, we all trooped back to my house where they dropped me off after hugs and 2 presents: a cool watch that hangs from my belt loop (very fashionable I&rsquo;m sure) and a set of microwaveable plastic bowls with a little vent on the top of the bowls to let steam out.</p>

<p><p>such a great 11,000th day!!!!</p>

<p><p>As of yesterday, according to Symantec Antivirus Center for the <a href="https://www.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/vbs.loveletter.a.html">loveletter</a> virus, there are 13 known variants of the loveletter virus.</p>

<p><p>Excuse me while I rant.</p>

<p><p><b>You fucking copy cats are a bunch of pansies!!!!  Changing the source code of a well written virus is spineless wussy baby bullshit pansy crap that Anyone could do!!  The sourcecode is freeware, sending itself around the world, and you think you&rsquo;ll be famous for adding your line of code?  You&rsquo;re a fucking idiot!!!  If you&rsquo;re gonna write a virus and destroy a bunch of someone&rsquo;s data, write your own fucking virus!!!!  Or at the very least, port it to another OS or MAYBE just maybe use your fucking head and DON&rsquo;T DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!</b></p>

<p><p>And to whoever wrote the original virus (female or male): good job, motherfucker, it worked. Now use your brain to figure out how to repair all the damage.</p>

<p class=date>12:09am CDT Sunday 7 May 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Gladiators was pretty cool story, but pretty gory.  I didn&rsquo;t watch
all the scenes.  Dudes fighting each other to the death is not my
favorite thing to watch.</p>

<p><p>The characters were well developed and the good guy won in the end.</p>

<p><p>How&rsquo;s that for a short synopsis of a 2.5 hour movie?</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>After the movie, we munched at Star Pizza, where Molly relayed lots
of stories of Rome and how they beat Carthage in naval battles and
salted the earth and became corrupted and how the Roman Empire
basically fractured and imploded.  Cool stories.  How does Molly know
all this?</p>

<p><p>Olivia, our waitress, was cute and amazed when I finished my 30
ounce glass of water after she brought it and before she left the
table.  &ldquo;You did not just finish this,&rdquo; her eyes wide.   &ldquo;Yup.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I drank 3.5 * 30 ounces, or 105 ounces of water during dinner, and
had lots of salad and even a couple slices of pizza.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>After Star Pizza, we walked across the street to Amy&rsquo;s Ice Cream.
I got vanilla oatmeal raisin ice cream and plain M&amp;Ms.  Very nice.</p>

<p><p>(I am so tired)</p>

<p><p>We sat outside and ate outside, laughing and joking about everything.</p>

<p><p>After Amy&rsquo;s they brought me home and hung out a bit for Wende to arrive.  Yay!!</p>

<p><p>- - - - -</p>

<p><p>Oh my gosh the best thing!!!!!!!  They got me a cool clip-on watch - similar to a pocket watch, but it&rsquo;s digital, and it clips onto a beltloop.</p>

<p><p>And some lovely microwave designed plastic bowls that vent automagically.</p>

<p class=date>1:40pm CDT Sunday 7 May 2000</p></p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m unpacking as Beastie Boys bump &ldquo;Root Down&rdquo; on our stereo.  I&rsquo;ve
got 5 different CD on random/spiral play mode.</p>

<p><p>This morning I installed 100% silicone around the outside edge of
our shower, where I&rsquo;ve discovered water enjoys frolicking after a
shower.  The silicone requires 24 hours to fully cure; we will have to
shower in the guest shower tomorrow morning.</p>

<p><p>I heated pizza rolls and cream cheese stuffed jalepenos for lunch
with Wende at Container Store.  I sneakily put our lunch in a Wendy&rsquo;s
bag, so at first glance, she thought I got burgers or something there.
Wende doesn&rsquo;t really like Wendy&rsquo;s, so it was a good trick.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m concerned that some of our bills have not been paid.  We&rsquo;ve got
like 10 different piles of papers &ldquo;to go through soon.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Soon&rdquo;
expired two weeks ago.  I&rsquo;m digging through stuff to make sure that
&ldquo;too late&rdquo; hasn&rsquo;t arrived.</p>

<p><p>Speaking of which, we didn&rsquo;t turn in &ldquo;Something About Mary&rdquo; back to
Blockbuster.  I&rsquo;m feel pissed and helpless that they&rsquo;ll charge a full
rental fee just for 1 extra day the movie was out.  This time we&rsquo;ve
kept it 4 extra days.  I dropped it into the slot; I don&rsquo;t want to
engage anyone at the counter right now.</p>

<p><p>After the piles are re-shuffled, I&rsquo;ll write some snail mail letters.</p>

<p class=date>4:27pm CDT Saturday 6 May 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Ultimate this morning was windy and soaking sopping ucky muddy wet.
Despite lots of sliding, I got a few good defensive blocks, and a
couple of great catches.  Because of the wind, I caught two (or three)
catches over/behind the intended recipient.  That was awesome.</p>

<p><p>I got some pics, plus a pic of most of the team with muddy legs.</p>

<p><p>I slightly injured my big toe, cramming mud up under my toenail.
Ow.  Also slid under some rock and slightly cut the cuticle above the
same big toe.  Ow.  Also skinned my knee sliding and catching the disc
for a point.</p>

<p><p>- - (we gotta go)</p>

<p><p>Um, met Molly, Maggie, John, Will at UH for a lovely game of disc golf.  We played 19 holes and dropped the worst scoring hole each.  I got 74, Will got 70, John got 94, Maggie 115, Molly 105.  Great fun!!</p>

<p><p>Now we&rsquo;re at my house, showered, and going to Gladiators!</p>

<p><p>Bye!</p>

<p class=date>10:20am CDT Saturday 6 May 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Today is my 11,000th day.  Bigger celebration than any birthday.
Even 30th.  When I got out of the shower, I found a card from Wende on
the sink. Inside is a Classic Pooh card.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be friends forever, won&rsquo;t we, Pooh?&rdquo; asked Piglet.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Even longer,&rdquo; Pooh answered.</p>

<p><p>I cried.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m sad that Wende is unavailable for the celebrations today.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>This morning I worked on labeling pictures in my <a
href="/cgi-local/images.cgi">archive</a>.  New pics are under
cats/spot_stairs and new notes are under &ldquo;Old Pics from UH&rdquo; (or
something like that).  Fun fun stuff!</p>

<p><p>I hope to get lots more pics today.</p>

<p><p>Last night I had an extended remix dream including 18 wheelers used
as roller coaster trains, a huge amusement park with waterslides that
spanned highways and neighborhoods.</p>

<p><p>I was talking/flirting with the woman in the ticket booth, asking
her how I can purchase a season pass to the park.  She had a little
shells just inside the glass window behind which she sat.</p>

<p><p>I stuck my hand under the window to harass the shells a little.</p>

<p><p>We got the world famous virus today.  One of my bosses received it and opened the attachment, ILOVEYOU.</p>

<p><p>I happened to be standing right by her and when she goes, &ldquo;uh oh, I think that was a virus; how can we stop it?&rdquo;  I turned off the machine.</p>

<p><p>(Back in the day, Steve Avery said, &ldquo;I never get mad at my computer, because I know I can always turn it off.&rdquo;)</p>

<p><p>Did research and found that this virus has been traversing the globe throughout the day.</p>

<p><p>Norton Anti-Virus was able to detect the virus, but not able to remove it.  I found <a href="https://www.getvirushelp.com">www.getvirushelp.com</a> which had information which removed the virus.</p>

<p><p>- -</p>

<p><p>But here is the weird thing:  The attachment she opened was ILOVEYOU.  The virus we detected and removed was PrettyPark.  Very interesting.  I&rsquo;m not sure if they are the same virus or if someone renamed PrettyPark, or what.  Hmmm.</p>
