<p>Jonas started at sbstrm today; he had a quick way to access apps and I was like, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; and he said, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have the free version installed now.</p>

                        <p>##19:10 Sunday 06 January 2013</p>

<p>Today we went to Tokyo Skytree!   We had to reserve tickets a month in advance.   Only problem was we had made the reservations for tomorrow!  Derp!</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know how we got into our heads today as the date, but the tix are for tomorrow.  Lin, Ma, and Fred will go while I&rsquo;m at work.</p>

<p>My ticket can be used within 30 days of its original date, so we might give it to A-san Su when he comes later this month.  Not sure yet.</p>

<p>So, instead of Skytree ascent, to Asakusa&rsquo;s shopping street we went.  Fred and I had gone yesterday with his friend Hiroshi (and Hiroshi&rsquo;s wife Masae), for Fred&rsquo;s first, and my second stroll down that street.  The most utterly packed shop yesterday was also packed today: the deep fat fried sweet yum yum shop had three registers, each with a line of about 3 people.  Fred said, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re making them and selling as fast as they can, and they can&rsquo;t sell them fast enough [to keep the line down].&rdquo;</p>

<p>We ate at a dessert shop on Orange Street.  It wasn&rsquo;t as ample as I had hoped, but my ice cream was served in a bowl suspended in a larger bowl of water with dry ice in it.</p>

<p>Weather got a bit chilly, so we were on the way home by 5:15pm, nearly 24 hours since Fred and I had met Hiroshi and Masae there the previous night.</p>

<p>Each time mouse cursor enters a circle, the circle will split into 4 circles, slowly revealing the picture (down to 7 levels of splits).</p>

<p>How many circles are in a fully revealed image?</p>

<p>(I think it&rsquo;s 4^7, or 16384)</p>

<p>Lin, Ma, and I went to a university library where we were looking for books or something.  I saw Christine and helped her find a book (which was unavailable ever since a KTRU dj had mentioned its greatness on the air).  Christine needed the book for a report due in April, but the book cost $91 so she wanted to borrow it from the library.</p>

<p>It was time to go, but we couldn&rsquo;t find Lin.  I was looking around for her in the crowds of people chilling in the park-like atmosphere of the university campus.  I saw Fred had just arrived and was like, &ldquo;yo have you seen Lin?&rdquo; but he had not so I was like, &ldquo;moe joe where is she?&rdquo; and then I realized I hadn&rsquo;t checked my phone.  I checked and she had listed out all the reasons this is a bad relationship, in some sort of free-form brainstormed list.</p>

<p><code>this is a bad relationship!</code></p>

<p>first the gasoline
then the rice
nb kind of kid</p>

<p>somehow I am passing
my accounting class</p>

<p>yay</p>

<p>no thanks to you</p>

<p>And I started to cry and I slid the phone to my mom, &ldquo;I found Lin,&rdquo; but she didn&rsquo;t hear me. moe joe, so thankful to wake up!</p>

<p>Fred, Ma, Lin and I went across the river to play with the RC helicopter Lin got for me.  Success: it&rsquo;s still flyable after a full battery cycle!   The packaging says it will fly for about 10 minutes on a single charge.  I got to fly it first, and the wind blew it pretty far away (as it flew up up up up) and to bring it down before hitting the highway, I nearly plummeted it down like a fragile plastic rock and broke the case of the camera, plus the shell of the copter.</p>

<p>It didn&rsquo;t work afterward, but then it started to work again; it seems to take its time before it wants to start again.</p>

<p>Lin seemed to fly it the best, with Ma a close second.  She landed it in the tennis court area, so I got to climb up and down the fence (and used the steps of the referee seat to climb down/up on the inside).</p>

<p>There was a guy out there with a &ldquo;sport kite,&rdquo; which had two strings on each side.  He had been using it for 10 years, and could do some neat maneuvers with it.  Fred got to play with the kite a decent amount of time and was able to control it a bit by the end, including launching it upside down from the ground.</p>

<p>No pics yet but they might be on my mom&rsquo;s FB wall already.</p>

<p>Ma, Mama, Lin, Fred, and I shared gifts and laughter.   I had the most fun watching Lin unwrap her teddy bear.  The outer box was apparently mailed from Fred to me, the next inner box was from me to Fred; the next inner box was from Fred to Lin; the next inner box was from Lin to Lin; the next inner box was from Lin to Ma; the next inner bag was from Ma to Mama; the next inner box was from Mama to me, but that box was actually for Lin, which she could see very clearly from its branding.  Lin was totally excited, and I&rsquo;m totally pleased that it worked so well.</p>

<p>In addition to shampoo I requested, Fred got me a 3D model puzzle of the Burj Khalifa, plus another old puzzle from back in the day (of which he has two copies).</p>

<p>Lin got me an RC helicopter with camera on it!!  I wonder how many times I&rsquo;ll be able to fly it successfully.</p>

<p>In addition to dental floss I requested, Ma got (the dry) chocolate chip cookie making ingredients for Lin and me (except for flour).</p>

<p>For fun, Fred brought one of the old sets of <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=321011097812">Tipovers</a> that we had back in the day.</p>

<p>Yay!</p>

<p>Funny that Fred and I got to go to Ofuna because the luggage lock didn&rsquo;t open with the number he intended to use, but we got some time to chat.</p>

<p>Bedtime soon.  Christmas tomorrow!!</p>
