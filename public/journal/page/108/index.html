<p>Last night AB was like &ldquo;hey we cannot send emails.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They got a 500 error because I forgot to enable mcrypt to create
passwords for new users.</p>

<p>Enabled mcrypt and manually fixed some shit that didn&rsquo;t work due to
the 500 error.  Got everything sorted today and then ready to work but
denied because</p>

<p>the local VM in virtualbox does not have access to the internet.  So I
switched it to Bridged Adapter and all that, but still not access.
Fuckit.  Switched everything(*) back to how it was, and still no access.</p>

<p>(*) apparently not everything</p>

<p>damn.</p>

<p>Well, my box is behind the times anyway because it&rsquo;s Ubuntu 12 whereas
live server is now using Ubuntu 14.</p>

<p>So now I am trying to get Ansible to spin up a local server on
Virtualbox for me.</p>

<p>Starting here, cause I could not find anything else that seemed
remotely helpful.</p>

<p><a href="https://atlas.hashicorp.com/geerlingguy/boxes/ubuntu1404">https://atlas.hashicorp.com/geerlingguy/boxes/ubuntu1404</a></p>

<p>$ vagrant init geerlingguy/ubuntu1404; vagrant up &ndash;provider virtualbox</p>

<pre><code>Vagrant was unable to mount VirtualBox shared folders. This is usually
because the filesystem &quot;vboxsf&quot; is not available. This filesystem is
made available via the VirtualBox Guest Additions and kernel module.
Please verify that these guest additions are properly installed in the
guest. This is not a bug in Vagrant and is usually caused by a faulty
Vagrant box. For context, the command attemped was:

set -e
mount -t vboxsf -o uid=`id -u vagrant`,gid=`getent group vagrant | cut -d: -f3` vagrant /vagrant
mount -t vboxsf -o uid=`id -u vagrant`,gid=`id -g vagrant` vagrant /vagrant

The error output from the command was:
</code></pre>

<p>$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest</p>

<pre><code>Installing the 'vagrant-vbguest' plugin. This can take a few minutes...
Installed the plugin 'vagrant-vbguest (0.13.0)'!
</code></pre>

<p>Well okay the box is running, but I do not see how to connect to it,
much less from a sibling VM in Virtualbox.</p>

<p>Back when I first started messing with Vagrant and/or Ansible, I found
a Vagrantfile that would spin up multiple boxes and let them all
connect.</p>

<p>Smartagent, where was that tutorial?</p>

<p>Ah crap, you don&rsquo;t exist yet.</p>

<p>Yes yes, something like this

<p>Now I have this gem</p>

<pre><code>(1..1).each do |i|
  config.vm.define &quot;ab&quot; do |node|
      node.vm.box = &quot;ubuntu/trusty64&quot;
      node.vm.hostname = &quot;ab&quot;
      node.vm.network :private_network, ip: &quot;10.0.15.2#{i}&quot;

        vb.memory = &quot;256&quot;
      end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>But dangit it keeps not being able to mount the directory /vagrant
inside the VM.</p>

<p>I am going to reboot my host machine and cross fingers and pray and
shake my head when nothing changes when it all comes back up.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s first three lessons went really well by simply having a four
part target per lesson: questions, text, test, game.  Thanks, Yuji!</p>

<p>I did a gamification of the questions portion of the lessons.  For
question correctly answered within about five seconds, the student
received a &ldquo;prize&rdquo; (single card from
<a href="https://www.learningresources.com/product/stacker+crackers--8482-+sight+words+game.do">Stacker Crackers</a>).
The cards give them something to fiddle with while other students are
answering questions, and hopefully inspires them to answer correctly.</p>

<p>For the 6-year-olds, I focused on three questions: &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; &ldquo;How
old are you?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; all spoken at native speeds.
They had about 85 to 90% accuracy on distinguishing the first two
questions.  100% answering the third question, but I kept it in there
due to its prevalence.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s last two lessons went well, though I was tired.  Focused on
cadence and intonation for the last part of the first of those two
classes.</p>

<p>Nice.  Now that I&rsquo;ve got a few Ansible playbooks set up (thanks,
Travis!), it&rsquo;s sorta kinda easy to spin up a new server with all its
personalized packages, bells, and whistles.</p>

<p>Today I got FS set up on a temporary server, including pulling a copy
of the DB and static files from the live server.</p>

<p>Basically, I need to split the live server into two: one that we can
give to CB and one that we continue to use for AB.</p>

<p>I left the AB DB backup process in testing mode (backup every hour, do
not clean up the files) and it killed the disk this morning and locked
up the server.</p>

<p>Thankfully, I was able to request support from AWS.  They called me
immediately and helped me dismount the flooded disk, remount it at
/mnt on a different server where I was able to clean up the disk, then
remount it on AB server and get the server running again.</p>

<p>As a result of some part of that process, the mysql server got a sad
and corrupted a DB table.  So then the mysql server could not write to
that table. Thank goodness AB noticed the problem quickly and I was
able to rebuild the table to get it working again.</p>

<p>Now I just need to copy 14 records from the mysql log to the table in
question, and everything will be as I hoped it would be this morning
at 9am when I hoped to start working on a different project.</p>

<p>I sent this to Fred yesterday:</p>

<pre><code>I often type `gits` to get the status of git.

There is one directory on my filesystem that has a filename
starting with 0x0x which I must not commit to git, but I need to
see each time I get git status.

I wrote this

    alias gits='git status; if [[ -f 0x0x* ]]; then echo; ls -1 0x0x*; fi'

And it works to *not* complain if there is no 0x0x* file, but does
not show the file if it is present.

The problem is prolly small; can you fix this with just an alias?
</code></pre>

<p>Fred sorted it out last night.  I replied inline:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>alias gits=&lsquo;git status; if test -n &ldquo;$(find . -maxdepth 1 -name 0x0x*
-print -quit)&ldquo;; then echo; ls -1 0x0x*; fi&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sweet!  It works well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Escape the * the first time, but not the second time.</p>

<p>because the first one is in the $()  ?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A couple gotchas that were emerging with your solution is that if
there is more than one match, the -f won&rsquo;t work.  Maybe right now
you never have that, but let&rsquo;s fix it while we&rsquo;re here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Definitely going to be more than one, so thank you for solving it!  In
fact, if the ls at the end could ignore files ending with ~, that
would be great.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We can set &lsquo;shopt -s nullglob&rsquo; which &ldquo;allows patterns which match no
files (see Pathname Expansion above) to expand to a null string,
rather than themselves.&rdquo;  But that&rsquo;s a bash-wide thing that might
bleed into your regular commands, so that&rsquo;s too risky.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>yeah that sounds spooky.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I thought of writing it as a command, instead of an alias, where we
can take the time to do a lot of checking and shit, instead of being
short and sweet.  Then I tried some other dumb ideas that I&rsquo;ve
already forgotten now, and finally decided to hit stackoverflow,
with what appeared to be the main issue: we need only to know if the
glob matches, not what the match is, or how many there are. So I
googled &ldquo;bash if glob matches&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are a few good solutions, and a good explanation of why each
is useful here:</p>

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2937407/test-whether-a-glob-has-any-matches-in-bash">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2937407/test-whether-a-glob-has-any-matches-in-bash</a></p>

<p>The one you want is probably</p>

<pre><code>if test -n &quot;$(find . -maxdepth 1 -name 'glob*' -print -quit)&quot;
then
    echo found
else
    echo not found
fi
</code></pre>

<p>for portability, and familiarity with tools you already know.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yay for tools I already know!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To put that solution in an alias, the quoting is awkward.  The glob
is already nested inside &ldquo;, &lsquo;, and $(.  The alias command wants
another nesting, and I&rsquo;m out of quotes.  So I removed the quotes
around the glob and escaped it instead.  That worked.  (Escaping the
quotes didn&rsquo;t for some reason.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Write a new RFC to allow 「 」as quotes in bash!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, your solution is as at the top.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yahoooo, as is my thanks!  Thanks for putting it at the top, cause I
gotta get back to work!</p>

<p>Got to chat with Jennie J today!  She&rsquo;s working overseas, and I miss
her so much!  We may have a chance to chat more soon?</p>

<p>I sent her a video</p>

<p>Today I hope to get AB server upgrade officially complete.  Need to
clarify a time with client and then do it, hopin&rsquo; all goes smoothly
(i.e. I have not missed anything).</p>

<p>Moe Joe</p>

<p>Lin is bitching at her mom.  In me it&rsquo;s triggering anger.  I just want
to yell SHUT THE FUCK UP GODDAMMIT because with them bitching I can&rsquo;t
work, nor sleep.</p>

<p>I know this reaction is my problem.  I am going to sit (and meditate)
a bit.</p>

<h2 id="09-46-monday-24-april-2017-jst">09:46 Monday 24 April 2017 JST</h2>

<p>Meditation worked wonders.  My feelings shifted from &ldquo;fuck you&rdquo; to
understanding that they have needed to get this fight out for a long
time.  I gave Lin hugs and kisses when she finally came upstairs.
They fought for over an hour.. must have been tiring!  She said they
came to a good understanding, though.</p>
