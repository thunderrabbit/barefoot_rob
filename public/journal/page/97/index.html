<p>Lin drove me to a clinic today because I got some kinda cold, and have
been coughing for a while.  Doc said it isn&rsquo;t contageous, but gave me
four (4) different meds to take 3 times a day for 5 days.</p>

<p>Today while running to catch my preferred train, I stubbed my toe.  It
didn&rsquo;t hurt all that much, but is just annoying that now I will have
to wear shoes for a bit while it heals.  I forgot to take a picture
right after it happened, but I posted one on twitter tonight.</p>

<p>Met new students for a first lesson in Nihonbashi.  Five beginner
students who all seem pretty genki. Some are more beginner than
others.</p>

<p>JB was there to do the introduction and everything went smoothly.  See
you guys again next week!  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egad I am missing SOGO again (4 times in a row)</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s nice to see Lisa and Miho!</p>

<p>Actually only Lisa is with us while Lin is driving, and they are all
blah blah blabbin chat chat chattin and missed a turn recommended by
GPS.  Twice.</p>

<h2 id="11-33-sunday-16-july-2017-jst">11:33 Sunday 16 July 2017 JST</h2>

<p>Okay we just got Miho yay!</p>

<h2 id="13-07-sunday-16-july-2017-jst">13:07 Sunday 16 July 2017 JST</h2>

<p>Only 1 hour (4.9km) to go! <del>Yay!</del></p>

<p>I could have fucking gone to SOGO and take the train down to meet Lin
and them. fack.</p>

<h2 id="14-00-sunday-16-july-2017-jst">14:00 Sunday 16 July 2017 JST</h2>

<p>We arrived.  So hard for me to understand how driving is preferable to
Lin.</p>

<h2 id="18-31-sunday-16-july-2017-jst">18:31 Sunday 16 July 2017 JST</h2>

<p>Okay okay the day turned out to be pretty good.  We had a nice time by
the ocean (not beach; it was all layers of volcanic rocks tilted at an
angle)</p>

<p>After we set up our tent and chairs, Lin found the same little pool
that we enjoyed 2(?) years ago.  I guided Miho there with the fewest
vertical changes, and then carried all our stuff to the spot.</p>

<p>Got into the water slowly; it was cold and wavy over sharp shells.
There is a still pool nearby where the water is a bit warm in the top
meter or so.  The warm pool had some anemones in it which I think may
have stung Lin, Miho, and Lisa.  I got poked by one so went out a
different direction.</p>

<p>We pet the cat at the ice cream shop with a cat and Lin did a cat
impression while I took slo mo video.  Not sure it is worth putting
online, but she seemed surprisingly not embarrassed by it, so she
might.</p>

<p>I climbed with Francois up a slightly steep hill next to the car and
then threw him down to get funny pictures.  Lin tried to throw him
back and he ended up in a place that required judicious use of the
parasol pole Lin bought for this trip.  Glad it came in helpful!</p>

<p>Lin was all set to buy Shungite from Renee, but we ended up with not
enough time to do so after going to Haruka lake and shrine.  The lake
was fine and the shrine was nice, but because we were late leaving
because of this extra trip, neither Lin nor I really took the time to
enjoy it. I did get a couple of pics, but nothing like wow holy shit
this was worth being late.</p>

<p>Once we got back to our car and on our way home, we had 1.25 hours to
travel what is turning out to be 3 hours, or exactly the amount of
time Lin intended to use to get home.</p>

<p>Anyway, I am not interested in being the manager of tours or any
variant of a tour guide.  Gonna have to pass on this one.  Montana
moment and all that.</p>

<p>Turned out fine.  The AC guy said because they missed the problem the
first time, they would fix it for free, and we do not have to be there
to let them in because it&rsquo;s related to the outdoor unit.</p>
