<p>Jack is funny.  Ranting at the mugbooks and computer when nothing
seemed to correctly produce Laura Douglas' home phone number.</p>

<p>He got in touch with her and she + Katy Robinson are supposed to be
here in a bit to pick Jack up.</p>

<p>They are still not here.  I'm going to leave for Fall Conference
soon.</p>

<p>Laura, Skyler, Kate, Graham all arrived and scooped up Jack after a
small feeding frenzy (Laura and Skyler (who wrote "sorry about this"
on the empty milk jug and put it back in the fridge)) a gossip session
(Kate, Laura, Jack), a URL chat (Graham and me), and a pact (all but
me).</p>

<p>I've gotten my comments being saved I think, but not 100% tested.</p>

<p>HI.  Wow.  Work was pretty hard today, and I don't think it was
more difficult than other days; I certainly didn't carry as much, but
I think I'm just tired from other days' work.</p>

<p>And...  I'm going to Fall Conference tonight to present some YRUU
games!</p>

<p>Funny things so far at Fall Conference:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>During opening circle, we were asked to say one thing that we
liked.  I <em>knew</em> Josephine would pick pink.  Laura or Jack (I
think), said "the color, not the artist."  I said, "I like Eminem, and
M&M's." When it was Graham's turn, he said, "I like to think that
people will have a good time this weekend."  Brilliant!</p></li>

<li><p>Near the beginning of All My Friends and Neighbors, Erica Nagel
didn't get to  move for several rounds.</p></li>

<li><p>Edward refused to play All My Friends and Neighbors, hollering,
"I'm disabled!!"  His left thumb is severely bruised (he dropped a
weight on it) and blue.  The nail will likely come off soon.  I
suggested that he use a small drill (dremel) to drill a hole in the
nail to release the pressure.</p></li>

<li><p>During the meet people game, where pairs of people introduced
one another, I introduced Anthony, who's from here, wants to move to
Italy and open a Judo Dojo, a restaurant where he will be the main
chef, and a UU church.  But actually he wants to play professional
soccer.  He has the best answer for what to wish for if a genie gives
him one wish.  And if he could have a super power, it would be to
create fire of any temperature.</p></li>

<li><p>We never found out what that perfect wish would be.</p></li>

<li><p>I like the font on Kate's new tattoo "No one, not even the
rain, has such small hands"</p></li>

<li><p>Amy and Amy introduced one another by signing their names and
each saying "and she has the best name ever!"</p></li>

<li><p>There was certainly other funny stuff, but I've forgotten.
Good night, all.</p></li>

<p>I've spent a bit of time working on code that will allow comments
on my entries.  Eventually, I'd like to create a system that will
allow people to view comments, and for people to be able to log in to
my site so they won't have to enter their name each time they
comment.  For now, clicking on the linked period below an entry will
display a page of the entry that would be commented on.</p>

<p>At Presonwood now, but I'm not here to work.  Jah Ivory took the
keys to the Ryder truck that we were loading for a different job down
at the shop.  Jah Jah called Johnny when they discovered the error.
Fortunately they called before Johnny even knew they were missing, so
we didn't waste time looking for them.  Just wasted time getting
them.</p>

<p>I did drop off Vince and Jimmy here at Prestonwood, so that was
something useful to do with my trip up here.</p>

<p><p class=dream>With an ethnically diverse group of people at a
SWUUSI Young Adult type situation, talking in a cabin in the woods
after having witnessed a guy who was in charge of food try to fund
something by stealing the remainder of alcohol from a party next door
and everyone got mad at him for being so silly and thoughtlesss about
this community.</p>

<p class=dream>As i walked upstairs with my plate/bowl of food,
someone said, "so Rob," and I was surprised that they knew my name,
"how do you rectify the fact that Cornfed is going to japan next year
with your first impression that he was just a testosterone driven
hick?"</p>

<p class=dream>"That's a good question," I stalled.  "Hearing that
sotry from him definitely changed my view of who he must be.  I was
quite impressed to hear that and I wold like to get to know him a lot
better now.</p>

<p class=dream>interesting thing is that the woman who asked m e was
referring to Cornfed having gone to Japan during the war, and I was
referring to him going next year to teach English.</p>

<p>Just had a meeting with Jennifer Nichols-Payne.  She asked that we
talk before Friday.  Good job us.</p>

<p>She told me that while it was just adults who were complaining
about me, she didn't really worry about it.  However, she has heard
directly from 2 or 3 youth, all female, who have said that they felt
uncomfortable with me as an advisor - that I'm creepy or that I hugged
them inappropriately.  This is the first time I have heard that any
youth have complained about me.</p>

<p>She said that she will talk to HAC-YAC and HARE, and try to get me
to the rally as either a guest speaker or something else.  I told her
my preference would be, if I couldn't attend the whole rally because I
don't have a church backing me as an advisor (and I don't have any
teenage kids of my own (don't get any ideas)), to attend the Saturday
night event, worship, talent show, Silent Football.  I said, "and a
hundred adults can watch me the whole time to make sure I don't do
anything inappropriate; I don't care."</p>

<p>In another irony, she said that some people have sent her portions
of my online journal, asking "should we be concerned about this?"
referring to something I had written.  How beautifully ironic.  In the
case she cited, she was all, "no," and the person apparently re-read
it and was all, "oh, you're right."</p>

<p>I will <em>definitely</em> focus some time on allowing people to
comment on my shit that I write in here.  If you have concerns, write
to me.  I'm not a hard person to talk to.</p>

<p>So I've been gone for lunch too long already.  I've got Eminem
blasting in my car as I write this, wearing my hoodie though it's hot
as fuck in here.  Lots of sweat.</p>

<p>Thank you to Jennifer for having the balls to talk to me, even if
it is just her doing her job.</p>

<p>Oh, she asked how I'd be with discussing advisor attendance at the
CYA meeting.  I told her I'd be fine; I won't freak out at the
meeting.  She further asked if I'd be okay with not attending part of
the meeting if others in the meeting are uncomfortable talking in
front of me.  Certainly no problem; I have plenty of things to keep me
entertained.</p>

<p>I only want what's best for the youth.</p>
