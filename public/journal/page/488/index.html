<p>I'm tired.  After ultimate, I didn't have enough time to get Jennifer her
key back before I had to be at KTRU.  She said it was no problem.  I'l give
it to her tomorrow.</p>

<p>KTRU got cut short tonight because of a baseball game.  I was only on
from 7pm to 8:45pm.  I'm thankful though, because I was so tired.</p>

<p>After KTRU I stopped by Kroger to get soy milk and 12 grain bread.</p>

<p>Josh, from ultimate (he was on the turquoise team until he was
injured) recognized me in the store.  I gave him the lowdown of the
games.  He said he'll have fun on Monday [heckling Andy, with whom he
works.]</p>

<p>I haven't put this (yet) in the entry about ultimate today, but I
keep hearing the music from the movie in my head.  In Phantom Menace
as Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi are fighting Darth Maul, the music
is huge and includes a full choir.</p>

<p>The two *!<em>best</em>!* team cheers we did at half times were our
version of that music.  From the Dadadiddlelille repetitive strings
then warming up dahhhhh, dah-daahhhhhhhhh, and working up to a
magnificent energizing tremendous acapella symphony of shouting...
Completely fantastic!</p>

<p>That reminds me to be thankful for having allowed myself to feel
completely merged with the team, a vital participant after having not
played with them for the first month (or more?) of league play.  This
day ruled.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>

<p>HAC YAC lock-in was tonight; we completed a well designed process
for creating a Mission/Vision statement for the group.  This was all
directed by Laura, who does this for a living.</p>

<p>The process was great; everyone seems to feel great ownership of
the process and the statement.  Good job to everyone involved!</p>

<p>My work pager was going off every 30 minutes or so during the
evening, plus I have ultimate tomorrow at 10am, so I skipped out on
the overnight part of the lock-in.  This is a first for me, and I feel
sad to be missing the awesome fun, but we'll have OKC Rally next
weekend, at which I should get plenty of staying up late time!</p>

<p>Got to work and realized I didn't have my backpack, and therefore
didn't have my keycard to get into the building.  I tried to "break
in" using a piece of cardboard slipped between the door and the frame
to set off the interior motion detector, but I couldn't do it.
Sigh.</p>

<p>Drove back to church and got my backpack.  I checked it, but the
key was not in my backpack either.  I must have left it at my
apartment.  To my apartment, where I also didn't find the key, but I
got a longer piece of thin cardboard that I was pretty sure would get
me into the building.</p>

<p>It did, and I checked the computers, which are all fine, but just
the checker wasn't able to get to the machines.  It's a problem with
the checker, not the machines.  Bedtime now.</p>

<p class=note>(In this entry, I give away details of the movie.  Don't
read the whole thing if you don't want them.)</p>

<p>I'm in line to see the 10:45pm showing of Star Wars.  I called a bunch of
my friends - at least like 7, and got all answering machines, except for 2,
who were otherwise occupied.</p>

<p>So I decided to go alone; I rode my bike to the theater, locked it to
some cables in the garage on the fourth floor.</p>

<p>I got tickets to the 10:15 showing, and went upstairs and found no one in
that line, but Angelique, Aaron, Mandy were in the 10:45pm line.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Robert," smiled Angélique.</p>

<p>Awesome!</p>

<p>So I went downstairs and changed my ticket.  It's only an extra 30
minutes.  :-)</p>

<p class=date>9:58 pm</p>

<p>The line is pretty significantly long behind us.</p>

<p>But the reason I'm writing is that I just heard a rumor that in Australia
they are trying to get Jedi listed as a religion.</p>

<p>Jeff just said "Jedi would be my religion; Yoda is my Jesus."</p>

<p class=date>1:16 am</p>

<p>Movie just ended.  EXCELLENT.  So many awesome scenes and funny funny
shit too.</p>

<p>Lot of inside jokes and introducing some characters that we saw in
episode IV.</p>

<p>Angelique was right= no outtakes.</p>

<p class=date>1:38am</p>

<p>Okay; I'm at work now.  My bike was fine, waiting patiently for me
on the fourth floor.</p>

<p>Do not read any further if you don't want details about the movie.</p>

<p>What I don't get is how the good guys got so many clones..  How did
Yoda scoop them all up so quickly?  Did he slide over to that
invisible planet and simply ask for them?  That makes sense since they
were so nice and hospitable, and they believed they were making clones
for the Jedi anyway.</p>

<p>Was that little kid Boba Fett(sp)?  Pretty interesting to find out
he's a clone.  I presume he was the "identical" clone they talked
about.</p>

<p>Um, oh, and who is Darth Sidius?  Is he Senator Palpatine, soon to
be come super all powerful of the Senate, then to become Emperor?
Hmmmmm.  Neat that we got to see Anakin's arm get removed.</p>

<p>Oh my god so awesome to see Yoda kicking some light saber
<em>ass!</em> Whipping around like some Matrix kinda shit all over
that motherfucker whirling and spinning and totally kicking his ass.
Interesting to see Yoda struggle with the 'heavy' object, when later
we've already seen him move the X-wing fighter out of the bog and say
to Luke the difference is only in his mind.</p>

<p>And <em>hilarious</em> that when the fight is over, Yoda wills his
staff to his hand and begins his little Yoda Shuffle to walk over to
Amidala.</p>

<p>I can completely see how Amidala falls in love with Anakin, and
completely see how he is poised to become Darth Vader.  Both sides of
his character were so well portrayed.  And <b>of course</b> I can completely
see how Anakin falls in love with her.</p>

<p>The fighting scene with Anakin, Kenobi, Padme in that big coliseum
was incredible.  So pimp to see all those light sabers light up as my
main man Samuel L Jackson was all, "we gonna kick yo ass biatch" to
that one bad guy.  The way those battle droids rolled in made me go uh
oh, they in some serious shit, man, and then Yoda all in the heat of
battle; I didn't expect to see him all rockin and rollin on a big ass
battleship giving orders and such.  Quite a cool new feature of his
character.  But of course we know later he says, "war does not make
one great." or is it "war does not great one make," or "great does war
not make one," or "does not make one great war." </p>

<p>Oh when those little (big) slug centipedes were all climbing on
Amidala, how did Anakin slice them perfectly in two and not even cut
her sheets?  That's some finely tuned light saber work.</p>

<p>The scenes of chasing that bad-girl-changeling through the floating
freeways of Corisant were better than those in Fifth Element.  Good
job.</p>

<p>I really loved that ocean world.  It reminded me of my query as a
youth if there could be a planet made entirely of water.  Now the
answer is obviously yes.</p>

<p>I think I might have a new favorite Star Wars movie.</p>

<p class=date>2:18am</p>

<p>Emacs rules.  I just taught it what timezone I'm in.  Excellent.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>

<p>Yesterday at work we learned that an incorrect question dataset had been
applied to the latest survey that my 5-minute survey creator created.  This
was the survey for a guy named Shaw.</p>

<p>So the question dataset was fixed, and I apologized to the one feedback
provider who had provided feedback for Shaw, and apologized to our middleman
client who got us the business with Shaw.</p>

<p>We spent 2 hours meeting to figure out the best way to doublecheck the
survey, and still keep the cost low ($250) for implementation.</p>

<p>I implemented the bulk of the doublecheck - when the survey is created,
we email out to people the parameters it is using.</p>

<p>I was glad to go home after that.</p>

(I'm using Netscape Communicator 4.76 on Windows NT 4.0) I clicked on the
link https://www.us.uu.net/support/cssurvey/index.html?A-CNS-000123456 as
indicated above.  This link seems to have the unique identifier that would
take me right to the survey, but it apparently does not.  I am instead taken
to a screen (https://www.uu.net/external/us/cssurvey//index.html) which has a
few problems of its own.

1) This URL has two slashes in a row "//"; this works, but is indicative of
a problem in your URL creator.
2) This login screen has a grammatical error: "it's" should be "its".
3) This screen asks me to enter my User ID, while the email gives me
something called a "logon id"  These two terms should be the same.
4) The screen asks me to enter my User ID without spaces or hyphens, yet the
logon id clearly includes hyphens.  (I tried entering "A-CNS-000123456",
"ACNS000123456", and "000123456" and none of these worked.)
5) The page I receive after entering any of the User IDs above has at least
two problems of its own:
    1) It says "LogonID, 000123456 not found!" (substituting the string entered
for 000123456 in this example).  Note that this error screen gives a *third*
name for the code entered: "LogonID," which is neither "logon id" as written
in the email, nor "User ID" as written on the previous web page.
    2) "LogonID, 000123456 not found!" is incorrectly punctuated.  Remove the
comma and it will be correct. I'll concede that some people would say it's
correct as written, but I think it's non-optimal.]

Final Comments - If there is anything else you would
like WorldCom customer service to know, please type
your answer in between the brackets below.
[Yesterday was our first full business day with our T1 line.  The line had
been up for a couple weeks, but we only had test web-traffic on it, making
sure it worked.  We'll give you the benefit of the doubt that it wasn't your
fault that on the *first* day we had real traffic on the line, the telco got
hosed and we had about 5 hours of downtime during the middle of our business
day.  It was quite embarassing for us to say, "oh we just switched to a new
ISP so we'd have *better* service and now we are down until god knows when."

When I call 800-900-0241, I have to press three buttons to get to a human.
When we are in crisis mode that our lifeline to the internet is down,
waiting through those menu items and "this call may be monitored" bullshit
is wasting precious time and dollars for us (and for you, considering you're
paying the toll charges for this 800-number).   When I call, I want to talk
to a human "Right Now."  Like Southwest Airlines.  Those cats pick up the
phone quickly.  It takes about 45 seconds for me to get to a human, even
when I know what buttons to press when the menus begin.

And even when I get to a human, that person is not techinical support.  They
are apparently only trained to fill out or look up a ticket.  And on the
first time I called, the person took our information and was apparently
unable to tell that a ticket had already been opened for this issue!  I
don't know if that was due to lack of training, or a system flaw, but that
wasted more of our (and your) time and money (on the order of 5 minutes,
probably).

Once the person on the first call determined that a ticket had already been
opened, she told us "they have already alerted you, but I don't know how."
Upon retroactive research, we learned that we were sent a fax indicating
that we were down.

(When someone calls back as a result of this feedback, please let's define
exactly how we need to be contacted.  This is the second benefit of the
doubt we'll give you that on our first crisis, you didn't have all the
correct contact information for us.)

In Q1A above, the question is about flexibility.  I described to my boss my
experience from yesterday as working with a big lumbering mammoth that could
not stray from its path.  Is there any way to get a phone number (even if
it's a toll number) that goes directly to tech support?  Maybe to someone
who knows that a ticket has already been opened due to the fact that our
line is down?

Q5 and Q6 I rated low only because I can't immediately get to tech support,
but have to go through the menu and a ticket-opening process as described
above.

I know that your stock has been changed to junk status, and the CEO just
quit.  I trust that the new CEO will shake things up and give you a
smoother, cleaner operation, ultimately taking all this feedback into
consideration.]

Thank you for taking this WorldCom Customer Service
survey.  [Word.]

<p>We just caught up with them in Buffalo, Texas, the same city in which our
van stopped on the way to Plano Rally, but this time on the opposite side of
I-45.</p>

<p>Sarah basically remained asleep during the entire visit during which time
I talked with Hamidah, who is Dad's sister in law (via his brother Ricky),
and who is from Singapore, where I now officially have family!  That
completely rizocks the hizouse; I love these connections that are perfectly
falling into place for me.</p>

<p>Oh, I am reminded that Marta's dad's friend wasn't a recruiter for
English teachers to Japan, but was simply in the program.  The documents she
gave me were an application for Aeon (which I wanted but hadn't collected
yet) and some information on their program.</p>

<p class=date>4:13 pm</p>

<p>We were supposed to go east from Buffalo, but we went 5 miles north on 45
before Fred looked at the directions.  I had asked him if he knew where we
were going.  </p>

<p>If by 'yes' you mean 'no', then yes.</p>

<p class=date>6:03 pm</p>

<p>Have just arrived in Tyler, chillin' and goofing around at the Holiday
Inn Express in room 129.  I think I will leave a note here behind the TV or
something.  All this furniture is removeable, so we may have to put it
somehwere else like behind the picture maybe.  Ah.  That's it.  I'll put it
behind the picture frome over the bed.  If I remember of course.  If I make
no other comments about it then I forgot.</p>

<p>Going to dinner in 35 minutes.  Have to leave tomorrow morning at
9:30am.</p>

<p>Okay, I did it.  There is a note in the bathroom behind the halfmoon over
the towel shelves.</p>

<p>I have a new girlfriend now.  Her name is Sarah.  She's
passionate, smart, likes to wrestle, likes the outdoors, likes to run around
barefoot.  She's knows some Spanish. She loves horses, and isn't afraid to
ask for what she wants, nor afraid to express her emotions when she doesn't
get it.  She's my six year old first-cousin once-removed, and she's a
fucking pain in the ass now so I just broke up with her.</p>

<p>This morning we played and played; she likes to pretend she's a dog; she
fetches a ball with little knob things on it that she can grab with her
teeth.  She fetched it with reckless enthusiasm, nearly knocking her head on
the piano, glass coffee table, couch, etc.</p>

<p>Then we took a walk in the next door field to visit the cattle, which we
kept a relatively safe distance from (30 feet-ish) as I am not familiar with
the personalities of these particular cattle.</p>

<p>Sarah, Fred and I are in Fred's car (red 1989 Camaro) en route to Tyler,
Texas, for my dad's wedding tomorrow.  During the first paragraph, Sarah was
trying to grab all my shit - phone, keyboard, handspring, wallet, keyboard
case, while I was trying to write.</p>

<p>I got angry a bit, which is why we broke up, but I'm sure we'll be back
together later today, while we wander around on all fours like animals,
neighing and mooing and barking</p>

<p>When I walked in last night, I was greeted by Fred and Becky talking and
Sarah asleep on the floor, looking <em>exactly</em> like Barbie.  So much so
that all my old feelings of a crush on my slightly older cousin came
flooding back from 20+ years past.  Amazing.</p>

<p>She's asleep now (2:19 pm) as I write this, and we're pacing 80 mph
behind an 18 wheeler, which Fred assumes will keep us (Fred) from getting a
ticket since the 18 wheeler will likely know where all the cops are.</p>

<p class=date>2:24 pm</p>

<p>Our pace-truck just got sidetracked by a weigh station.</p>

<p>As we walked around, Sarah wanted <em>so much</em> to ride the horses.
She believed that the farmer (our neighbor) had given her permission to ride
(likely true), and she further believed it would take only five minutes to
ride.</p>

<p>We kept telling her no though, because we didn't have enough time.  We
were going to leave in 15 minutes.</p>

<p>"But I want to ride for only <em>five</em> minutes!" she explained
clearly.  "It will take only 1 minute to talk to the farmer, and I just want
to ride the horse for five minutes.  Not even ride; just sit on it for five
minutes."</p>

<p>So clear was her conviction.  So accurate was the arithmetic.  1 minute
plus 5 minutes equals 6 minutes, which is clearly less than 15 minutes.  Why
can't she ride??</p>

<p>So plain to me was the innocent awareness of time.  No concept of what we
think is "five minutes."  To her five minutes means the amount of time it
takes to do something fun, or the amount of time her interest can be
captured by something.  Anything.</p>

<p>But then, equally interesting in a different way was this.  "Sarah, you
will be able to ride the horse on Monday."  "When is 'Monday'?" she asks, as
Monday is plainly an undefined term in her brain.  It's the day after
tomorrow."</p>

<p>"But that's like fifty days away!!"  Fifty days = infinity.  Such a
ridiculously monstrously long time to wait to simply ride a horse, an
activity that will take only six minutes.</p>

<p>Thank you, Sarah, for sharing your fresh concept of time.</p>

<p>Ate at China Cafe, a chinese buffet place.  I gorged more than I have in
recent memory.  In private, I told Elise that I was still holding a grudge
on her mom for when Elise was picked up from me-an-Wende's house in a most
controlling way, I thought.  I still think.</p>

<p>Elise said, "we all do [hold a grudge]"  Interesting.  I'd like to
process more with Elise through these feelings.</p>

<p class=date>1:55 am Sunday 12 May 2002</p>

<p>After dinner we visited Karen's parents house, and I promptly fell asleep
on a couch for the majority of the visit.</p>

<p>Afterward, I carried Sarah on my shoulders at Wal-Mart as a few last
minute items were purchased.</p>

<p>Back at the hotel, I chilled/wrestled with Sarah in her family's room as
we watched The Cosby Show and Whose Line is it Anyway. WLiiA is *funny*!  I
was really impressed with the realtime skillz of those actors.  That takes
talent.  "Chicken with an attitude" and "sing all the gospel parts of 'I am
a toaster'" were the two funniest I thought.  Especially when relaying them
to Fred after I was able to pry the little Sarah-fingers off my clothes and
wallet chain trying to keep me in their room for the night.  Such tears,
both from Sarah and Fred for opposite reasons.</p>

<p>Sent an email to Calder, and one to Bronwyn.  Then shower and now
bed.</p>
