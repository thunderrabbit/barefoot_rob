<p class=date>9:49pm CDT Wednesday 26 July 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Ultimate was great tonight!!  I&rsquo;m pleased that I set a goal to play
from 7:30 to 9pm and stuck to that goal (normally I stay until the
very end).  I ran plenty and had one great defensive play early in the
game.  Then Mark L and I were on the team receiving the kick-off, and
he stepped in front of me.</p>

<p><p>I was all, &ldquo;what?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting the disc.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Okay.  I&rsquo;ll run down there and you throw it to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Back left corner?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah I&rsquo;ll fake it toward the center and then zip over there.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Disc was thrown, I sprinted to the middle of the field.  Just as
Mark caught it, I super sprinted right through the crowd, barely
eeking my way around Mike who was like, &ldquo;WHoah!!&rdquo; as I zipped past
him.</p>

<p><p>To the corner disc was coming fast and low and I caught it in a
lovely roll across my back from right shoulder to left hip.  So fine.
Totally ecstatic to have made such a great catch!!  Andy (I think)
likened it to Neo in <em>The Matrix</em> where he does a cartwheel to pick up
the machine gun.  What a great compliment!!</p>

<p><p>Later in the game, I was part of a billiard-like collision.  I
sprinted one way, was slowing down as the disc was turned over and Al
and Raymond started running my way.  Al bounced chest to chest with
me, and I was grabbing his arm to keep him from falling back and then
<em>blam</em> Raymond hit him from behind, the back of Al&rsquo;s head
bonking Raymond&rsquo;s forehead.  Ow!!</p>

<p><p>Raymond had a bump, and I&rsquo;m sure Al did too.  But they both claimed
to be okay as they stood on the sidelines.</p>

<p><p>In my last great play, I was on defense and Shawn had thrown a long
pass toward the end zone.  Tony (offense) and I both ran crazy fast for
it, but he came in at a 90 degree angle to my motion, and offense
always has the right of way in ultimate.  I slowed down so as to not
have a mid-air collision with him.</p>

<p><p>I went home after that play and on the way out saw Sarah and
I-forgot-his-name drive up.  Said HI to them and asked about Java
programming; I&rsquo;m looking for an example of an applet that can read a
text file off its server (while the applet is running on user&rsquo;s
browser).  They didn&rsquo;t have an answer for me.</p>

<p><p>As I drove off, I recognized what I&rsquo;m missing most about Wende
being gone.  I haven&rsquo;t had my quota of hugs!  I have basically not
touched anyone since my I-group on Monday (and crashing into Al
tonight).  And before that I hugged Jennifer and Maggie and Molly on
Saturday.</p>

<p><p>Definitely need more hugs.</p>

<p>Didn't work on Java, but read through messages on posted on BBST.

<p>Bed now.


<p class=date>7:02am Thursday 27 July 2000</p>

<p><p>At 4 am-ish I woke briefly from a dream about FSD (my work) doing a survey on itself.</p>

<p><p>Today is the day that I&rsquo;ve been asked to clean up the house- just like scrub the shower and the sinks and mirrors and sweep the floor kinda thing.  Wende&rsquo;s parents come into town tomorrow for their family reunion.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m not yet saying it&rsquo;s &ldquo;our&rdquo; family reunion, and that&rsquo;s okay.  I&rsquo;ve never been to this family&rsquo;s reunion before.  Maybe next year.  Maybe not.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>In a dark alley with goons around, trying to take my
watch and wallet, I was all, &ldquo;No&rdquo; but they kept chasing me, until I
ended up in a warehouse that was actually like a bunkhouse where my
cousin peter was staying.  He was playing cards on a card table with
Fred, playing spades, and I ran past them and jumped on the bed, and
the goons started playing cards as if distracted but also as if
nothing had happened.  Fred and Peter were pleased to have them join,
and welcomed them.  The the game was over and they all started chasing
me to get me to play cards and I ran outside into the woods and was
running to get away from them.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I realized it was a dream so I tried to get up some
speed to fly.  There were lots of trees around me, and I was able to
fly a little bit.. then the ground fell out below me as I reached the
edge of a cliff, and I flew out over the trees in the valley below.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Was able to fly pretty well, but not with the
extraordinary speed that I craved.  I kept trying to push myself
faster, but it didn&rsquo;t work.  I imagined myself with essentially
superman power, flying with fists forward and that helped.</p>

<p><p class=dream>The coolest was flying really low to the ground between
two oncoming freight trains.  My jet power motion flying between the
oncoming trains made my apparent motion just SO fast.  Wonderful!!</p>

<p><p class=dream>When I was done flying, I disengaged from a video game
thing.  That explained how I had been able to fly.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was in an arcade, and looked for some change so I
could play again, and I found a tray with many loose dimes and nickels
which had been discarded since they were not quarters.  There were
some quarters in the pile, but they were from different countries, or
different original 13 colonies, and therefore the wrong size to be
quarters for the machine.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I collected the coins one at a time and noted that one
dime was made of silver!  Oooh it must have been a pre 1965 dime.  I
looked and the date was from like 1908 and then it changed to 1408.  I
was quite impressed to have found such a rare and valuable coin, and
had a little twinge of this must be a dream. I vaguely looked around,
and thought no, it looks real.  Awesome!</p>

<p><p class=dream>Then I found a dime from 2011, and the design had the
year written in roman numeral MMXI which was pretty cool.  Wow!  A
coin from the future!  I&rsquo;m so lucky since this is real!</p>

<p><p>Hungry cats woke me up.</p>

<p><p>I am pretty pretty close with finishing my applet that allows the balls to change direction on the sreen.  You can view it <a href="/java/dynamicBalls/">here</a>.  Note that as of now, the balls bounce, but the controls do not affect the motion of the balls.  However, note that the controls are set at seemingly random settings- these settings reflect the attributes of the balls.</p>

<p><p>However, I got a new project at work, which I shall call el.  Or maybe El.  depends oN my MoOd.  The project is basically retrofit the big big 6 week work-yer-butt off project.  Can you have it done by Aug 5th?</p>

<p><p>Yes, actually, I believe I can.  I made a generic version of the big big project, so now all I have to do is send two variables which indicate the name of the survey (El) and the image for the survey (el image) that will be drawn at the top of each page.</p>

<p><p>Bang, basic survey complete.  They do want a few changes from the way the generic one works, but the modifications basically require removing code, which is a lot easier than adding code in this case.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>And, I just got another project offer from Dude!  $70 per hour to write a java applet.  How lovely and fortunate that I have just been learning java!  I don&rsquo;t really have a guesstimate how long it will take, but this client is apparently a far cry from my first $10 per hour client.  :-)</p>

<p>Tonight I visited Jennifer and Lance's house (on the opposite side of us from Jennifer and Bob.)  The grout between the slats of their wood floors is coming up, similar to ours.  We will hire a 3rd party floor person to come examine and see what he thinks is happening, and then we'll talk to our builder.  The houses are still under warranty.

<p><p>I showed Dude and Rocky (via AIM) my new applet.  Dude noted that either left or right mouse button would make the blue dot move..  that made me realize that I could catch the different mouse buttons and make the different balls move according to which mouse button!  left click moves the blue ball, right click moves the red ball and ctrl-click moves the green ball.  Nice!</p>

<p><p>Now I&rsquo;m tempted to add controls to the side of the applet that will allow the velociites of the balls to be changed dynamically, or to change the color or size of the balls.   However, I&rsquo;m realizing it&rsquo;s going to be a tad tricker than I had first thoght.  I&rsquo;ll have to plan it more slowly.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m certainly enjoying getting paid to learn java!!</p>

<p>been reading java for 2.5 hours.  cool stuff.

<p class=date>3:57 am Sunday 24 July 2000</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>at a hotel, parking lot, after having driven up while tired, all my stuff was in the car as I waited for the other passengers to get their stuff out, but once they got it out, they didn't wait for me to get my stuff out.  then some other youth were in the car (kT for one) and I think Mike L for the other (Danielle's ex-um friend) and I asked them to help me carry everything inside in one trip.  I loaded up a bunch of coin collection stuff on Mike. 

<p class=dream>hotel converted into my house and we were chillifying on the couch, Elise was asking me if she could be one of my patients as I had just begun my schooling at USM.  I told her that I could not be her therapist, ought not, because then we wouldn't be able to play like this (many other people were around as we all flopped on the couch, her on my lap.)

<p class=dream>and she was all, well in school, we are encouraged to talk to our friends, when we have problems, and you are my friend, so I should be able to talk to you if I want.  

<p class=dream>I didn't have an answer for her. that logic seemed correct.

<p class=dream>I was alone in the house, and it was really getting messy.  ridiculously messy with dishes teetering in the sink, broken chairs,  food spilled on the floor, old half cooked pancakes on the stove,.  my friends had been over and made a wreck of the place, and I knew I needed to get it cleaned up, but I just had to take a nap first.  

<p class=dream>sleeping and then my mom called and I grabbed the phone so as to not let my parents be woken up and it was my mom who said "we are leaving for Australia in 40 minutes."

<p class=dream>I hung up on her in a rush to get off the phone so I could get ready in time.  Tossing clothes into my green bag,  digging out of the mess stuff to bring, wondering if I should bring australian coins from last year or just get all new ones. 

<p class=dream>my mom got up and was gettng ready as well,  the idea was that the house alarm would go off in 40 minutes, and we would have to leaving right at that moment, before the alarm monitoring company would call to see if it was a real alarm.  

<p class=dream>I was trying to clean up stuff as I grabbed clothes, wondering if I should just bring all shorts or if i would need some pants. what about shoes?

<p class=dream>there was a brick and I asked ma where she wanted it, and she said "I dunno it's your brick", so I threw it out into the yard with all the other bricks in the front yard.

<p class=dream>the reason we were getting ready so fast and leaving so fast was so that dad wouldn't be ready on time and therefore wouldn't go.. that was my mom's plan, in an effort to go without him

<p class=dream>I was loading stuff into my pockets watching some fluffy birds, some white birds in cages and tinkerbell woke me up trying to sleep by my head.

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>In a walgreen's type store, I saw a new nine inch nails CD that I hadn't seen before.  I 1/2way recognized it was a dream, and began to carefully memorize the image on the CD.  interesting thing that on the bottom of the picture on the back, which appeard to be simply a photograph of the stage being set up, I noticed that the people near the bottom were all images of John Goodman at various stages of his life all with the same expression of no emotion.

<p class=dream>and the lo, trent was there with me, and I was talking to him about just general stuff.

<p class=dream>as I studied the Cd case, I said "trent," and gave him a kiss on the cheek, "I love your music."   he said thanks and was willing to answer random various questions, which I don't remember the questions or the answers.  but he showed me the new nine inch nails logo, which was a clear crystal with NINININI etched onto the bottom,and if viewed correctly, appeard as NIN (backwards N) and when held upside down,  appard as ni(backwads n) (lowercase)..  I studied and marveled at that logo for a while, . it was like melted into the plastic, or like a bubble in the plastic of the jewel case.

<p class=dream>then he showed me another image on the Cd.  when viewed straight on it appeared as static, but when viewed at an angle, it was an image of trent's skull with a chrome appple in the middle of it and gentle hands cradling the apple, all inside his skull.  That image was more like a hologram thad a 3D actual shape though.

<p class=dream>then he said somthing and I thought he had to go, but no. he just wanted to show me the 4th CD that was available, and I almot got the happy feeling that he was going to purchase it for me (and maybe all 4) so I followed him to a different part of the store, and thought about telling him that I had grabbed the microphone when he threw it out into the audience when he played in Austin (true story), but I didn't.  the different part of the store to which we walked was actually just on the other side of a person who had been standing beside us at the CDs.  I noticed that this was odd, and I woke up.

<p>(this is an example of me only being slightly expectant and then disappointed at not having the coveted item in real life out of my dream)

<p><p>Tonight I surprised myself in I-group.  I felt disconnected from
everything, so I presented my feelings to the group and quickly found
myself in tears that I miss Wende &ldquo;so much, and it&rsquo;s only been 2
days.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>The core was fear that I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to take care of myself
without her around.  I then recognized that I was hungry, and hadn&rsquo;t
eaten dinner.  So I checked out of the group and came home to eat.</p>

<p><p>Read some Java In a Nutshell book, and now I&rsquo;m going to bed.</p>

<p><p>KTRU was okay yesterday, but I really felt the pang of not being at Molly and Will&rsquo;s party.  Specially when they never called me.  I didn&rsquo;t expect them to listen to the whole show, but I had hoped for at least one call.  I said a lot of funny inside joke type stuff at the beginning, harassing Melanie a bit (who at Molly&rsquo;s asked about the phone number; was it KTRU or KTRUE at the end?  I told her it was KTRUE or KTRUF.) by saying the phone number was 713-348-KTRUE or KTRUQ or whatever you want it to be.</p>

<p><p>This morning I worked on Java stuff, and I made my first little applet with which I am really pleased.  It should be available <a href="/java/3balls">here</a>.  Try clicking your mouse on the applet!</p>

<p><p>Yay!</p>
