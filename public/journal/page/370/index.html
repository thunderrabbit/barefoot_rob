                        <p class=date>10:14pm JST Saturday 26 April 2003</p>

<p>Just blah fuckin' blah today.</p>

<p>My emotion-meter fell and fell as I woke up this morning.  Just
feeling fucking pissy about everything and about nothing and what
seems like all this shit I've got to do and how the FUCK is that
possible if I have completely recreated my life so that I don't have
YRUU, don't have a car, don't have *any* responsibilities except to
work and I choose to study Japanese.</p>

<p>So what else is there?   Okay, my debt, but I lump that in with
work; I can't do anything about it until I get paid (in 2.5 weeks,
baby!)  (holy fuckin' shit in less than 24 hours, I will have been
here one month).  </p>

<p>There's letter writing.  I enjoy getting letters.  Shit, I *love*
getting letters.  And I know a good way to get them is to send them.
I am so lucky that I've received far more letters than I've sent
(mostly from janette) but I wish to return the favor.  I realistically
can't possibly keep up with the number of things Janette has sent me,
but the rest would be doable.  Jackie's letter was so awesome that I
replied to it within 24 hours.  But my mom's letter waited some days
(weeks?) before I replied.</p>

<p>I've been really good at studying and I bought my dictionary, and
I've allowed myself to be more bold in talking to people, but I still
quickly fall back to broken English instead of trying to muck through
in Japanese.  But fuck what am I going to communicate using only
hello, good morning, good night, how much is that?, where is that?,
how old are you? and what's your phone number?</p>

<p>It's coming together.  It's coming together.</p>

<p>Today at work I started out PISSED but I think it was really just
anger resulting from stuffed down bottled up seething sadness because
I'm like here all alone in this fucking country and I have not hugged
anyone one single time.  I've barely *touched* anyone and god I miss
that so much.  But I can't seem to be all, "hey man, will you hug me?"
even to a non-male type person cause it's either A) too weird (like at
work) or B) too weird (like with any of my friends who are not really
great friends yet that I can just hug) or C) too expensive (like with
a prostitute) (and I'm not just talking cash expensive; that would
destroy my integrity with Janette and even more critically with
myself)</p>

<p>And why are there no fucking paper towels in this country?????
These Japanese motherfuckers wrap *EVERYTHING* in plastic I can buy
one fucking tiny item at the store and they'll fucking put it in a
bag!!  Only *ONCE* with me asking has a clerk simply put tape on the
items barcode to indicate it had been purchased.  I mean check this
shit out when Andrew and I were walkin' around Tsunashima he got a
thing of FRENCH fries and they put them in a little french fry thing
like always.  Then they put it in a paper bag.  Okay, fine.  It was to
go.  But on *top* of the fries in the bag, they put a piece of like
blotter paper to soak up the oil and *THEN* they put the paper bag
into a plastic bag!!  It's like dear holy fucking shit (sorry Marcel)
if you're so concerned about recycling DON'T USE SO MUCH SHIT!
Fucking country is the size of California and they won't use
<em>paper</em> (read biodegradable) towels because of landfill
problems, but they put *everything* into useless plastic bags.</p>

<p>Every time I pee at work, I have to dry my hands on my pants (or
not wash them at all) cause there's no paper towels (and no air
dryer)</p>

<p>So then during my first</p>

<p>wait</p>

<p>I arrived at work at like 8 fucking o'clock because for some weird
reason I got up that early and just went cause I had told myself the
night before to get up at the right time and just go, and for the life
of me (shit I hate using cliches) I can't see the silver lining on
that fucked up cloud hanging over my head but I try to see the bright
side of things so I still trust there's a method to the madness and
that I'm better off for having stuck to my guns and followed my
original plan.</p>

<p>So I was in a pissy mood and couldn't focus on my flashcards cause
they were just too many and all the wrong things to learn anyway and I
didn't want to make any more so I just took a nap and basically got to
sleep 5 minutes before people started arriving to begin the day.</p>

<p>But no one with a key arrived until 9:15 and in 45 minutes we had
like 6 people all crammed into one little room all in each other's way
because of the way shit is set up there and I've made some suggestions
on what I think are pretty small things that would *REALLY* help the
traffic flow around the place (one of the *first* things I thought is
that we needed to have a system like in a doctor's office cause
they've got a million files and before the day begins, they pull all
the files they need and put them in a pile for easy access during the
day and put them up when the file is complete.  I didn't suggest this
because I had been there 2 days, but lo, Guy suggested it (he's been
there a couple years and suggested it before) and it got done.  I was
pretty mad at myself for not having spoken up; I'm going to be more
vocal about the other suggestions that I think would really help the
work flow.  But I often keep shutting myself down with imagined
responses (especially from motherfucking Steve who is so ingrained in
the way things currently exist it's like he's just caught in this moldy
stagnation and I think he likes it because he knows all the answers
to the questions that come up and it makes him look smart when really
he's just a perfect non-critically-thinking Nova clone that does all
the things the beauracracy wants him to do or some shit like that) but
as I get more comfortable with shit then...  man fuck that I should
just tell them what I think when I think it.</p>

<p>Anyway, we were all like bees buzzing into one another to crowd
around (1rst) the schedule where everyone MANUALLY WRITES DOWN WHAT
HAS BEEN PRINTED BY A COMPUTER which (and this is my first suggestion
that I made to Cory, but I'll make it more vocally to everyone I see)
leads to transcription errors and wastes a lot of time cause whoever
prints this copy could just print two copies when they print this
copy.  You know what arguments were against it? (1) wasting paper (I
USE AN ENTIRE SHEET OF PAPER to write my day's info down (whereas I'd
only be using a strip otherwise)) and (2) sometimes the schedule
changes.  THE SCHEDULE CHANGES ANYWAY!!  We still have to fucking go
back to the master copy and look for changes and note them on our
handwritten versions; we'd just write them on the printed versions!
and (2econd) into the big file drawers to pull our files.  It's bad
enough that we are all bumping into one another on one row of files,
but the files are arranged in three rows stacked vertically</p>

<pre>
1 |||||||||||||||||
2 |||||||||||||||||
3 |||||||||||||||||
</pre>

<p>So we are bumping to people next to us *and* bumping into people
above slash below us.  It's easily arguable that there's no room to
fix this, but what we need is to knock down the wall that's behind the
files and split the two most commonly used rows away from each other
vertically.</p>

<pre>
1 |||||||||||||||||   2 |||||||||||||||||
                      3 |||||||||||||||||
</pre>

<p>The wall behind them is just for a closet that's mostly dead space
anyway, with a bunch of old <em>dusty</em> shit that needs to be
thrown or stored in some less valuable real estate.  People (including
Steve) were suggesting that the wall be knocked down, and when I lay
on them this idea of splitting the rows, they've *got* to see how much
easier it would be.</p>

<p>(3ird) is that we all crash into one another in the drop box area
after pulling the files..  See..  seee... because there are only 10
minutes between classes to write down our thoughts on up to four
people, put the files away slash give them to the next instructor who
needs them (not that it's particularly simple to know who may need the
files), and get the next files from the drop box slash shelves slash
previous instructor, we are forced to basically pull all the files in
the morning to plan what lessons we will teach that day.  And because
students usually come for 1 or 2 consecutive timeslots, and because we
are not (usually) given the same student twice in a day, there are one
or two or three instructors all looking for intersecting subsets of
files, with no good way to communicate who is looking for (or has
found (much less where they've placed (in the drop box, back in the
main files, or on a table somewhere))) the same files except
say/listen for things like "has anyone got any level fives?," but
since we're all focusing on our own numbers: (!1!) Levels (7C, 7B, 7A,
6, 5, 4, 3, and 2) and (@2@) four digit student numbers (e.g. 6540,
7204, 8399) (and some student's numbers have *changed* (this is a
whole nother complication that I hardly yet have a good solution
because I don't yet grok all the reasons the problem happens) so the
computer printout might say 6324 but that file doesn't seem to exist
and we look in the "pink book" (only 1 copy of this; it might be
helpful to have 2) and find the number to see it's the student's *new*
number in the computer but their file is still under their old number
(maybe a solution is to relabel the file when the student gets a new
number (though I don't know *when* students get new numbers--are the
files readily available at that time, etc)) which means we might have
two 4-digit numbers to deal with per student (and if we just forget
about the old number, then when some instructor mentions it (the old
number) we won't remember to tell them "oh the new number is ...."))
and (#3#) numbers representing what room the lesson will be in
(thankfully this doesn't usually change during the day, but it does
change from day to day), and ($4$) what timeslot the lesson is in, and
(%5%) the level of the students in the lesson, *and* (^6^) the lesson
number we're choosing for the lesson (the algorithm for such choice is
to open all the students' folders (if we have found them!), trying not
to let pages fall out of up to four different folders and look at the
summary sheet to see what lessons were done on what dates and trying
to find a lesson in common that none of the students in the class have
done at all or at least not done recently), we can hardly listen to
multiple people uttering what files they are looking for "level five?
anyone, level five, number six five seven nine for Tatomi Jiuku?"  And
because we've all at some point been using the same numbers, so it's
not like we can easily say "okay brain, for the next five minutes if
you hear 'level seven A', perk up" because we've only got a precious
few minutes to parse *all* those numbers......  It's just fucked.</p>

<p>And (4rth) is that there's hardly enough room for everyone to work
all at the same time. (pulling files, analyzing files, writing files,
filing files)</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Jeeze pease Louise I've written enough about the fucked uppedness
at work.</p>

<p>So anyway, I was in a piss poor mood at work to start because *no
one* could find any of their files.. well a couple people did, but I
sure didn't and I had just gotten up early and was tired tired tired
and pissy and </p>

<p>Fuck.</p>

<p>Anyway, I made a conscious effort not to just flip out and go
postal cause all I really want is a hug and for everything to be okay
and for me to maybe *have* my files when I want them (shit no more
about the files!) and I went to my first lesson and started out mad
and consciously didn't take it out on the student (thank god it was a
man to man (still dislike that term) and I did have his file) but paid
attention to him and answered his questions happily and helpfully and
basically cheerfully...</p>

<p>Short version is that my mood improved throughout the day (a
lowpoint was realizing I hadn't brought to work the phone number to
recover my bike) and it was great to see Laura in such a spritely mood
(she's only got one more week in the hell hole of work and then goes
back to her boyfriend in England) that's she's exuded for the past
some days (we're having a party for her tomorrow after work; maybe I
can get a hug under the guise of wishing her well (how fucked up that
I'm thinking this way like it's so subversive to just get a hug) on
her new adventures) and her happiness helped pull me up some (though
I'm pretty sure there's still sadness sqwushed down in my somewhere)
but then it went poopy again on my way home and I can't even really
point to a reason why, but it just did.</p>

<p>I wandered around looking for the "other" internet cafe that is
supposed to be cheaper and offer free drinks (and I finally found it
(I spoke to someone, asking in Japanese "where is the internet cafe?"
but then being totally lost when he told me where, but he took me to
it, god bless him)) and lo, it is cheaper (320 first hour then 50 yen
per ten mins, instead of 380 first hour then 50 yen per ten mins),
plus they *do* have free drinks (but just tea and coffee), and they
have free sweeteners and creamer and little "syrup" packets of
sweeteners designed for tea, *and* they have more room instead of
teeeny little cubicles into which I can barely squeeze, so I stayed
for a couple hours once I found it.</p>

<p>Felt okay after that, but then after the nine million mile walk
home, I was all pissy again and found myself looking at *every* bike
to see if somehow I've been overlooking it for these two days, but no,
none of them seem to be mine... but it irks the crap out of me the
number of bikes that are parked right where mine was parked...  I'm
trying to see the light; to just <em>Be</em> in the moment without a
bike...  not <em>without</em> a bike, but just with my feet.</p>

<p>Once I got home I wanted to destroy something again and I ate a box
of cookies (208 grams) and drank a liter of OJ that I bought at Lawson
on the way home.  That was my destructive behavior of the evening -
self destruction.</p>

<p>I'm thankful that I was able to direct my energy into the project
of writing this entry.</p>

<br>rob!!!!<br>
i read your entry and i&rsquo;m  exhausted.  good grief.<br>
1st- what made jackie&rsquo;s letter so awesome?  (i want to know what constitutes an awesome leter in your estimation- it&rsquo;s an aries thing- you wouldn&rsquo;t understand)<br>
2nd-i appreciate you coming out in print that we have a committment of some sort with one another, with your item about not wanting to destroy your integrity with me. wow<br>
3rd-wow.  i wish i could hug you. it would do me alot of good ,too. what is the deal?<br>
4th-i forgot- o! hahaha- the papertowel rant!!! that is so funny. i hope this doesn&rsquo;t offend you, but you are so cute and funny as hell when you go off on shit like that. <br>
5th-i got dizzy with your description of efficiency strangulation.  damn!  and don&rsquo;t you hate it when you come up with a good idea and someone else says it before you? ouououou seeth, gnash<br>
D). no wonder you felt poopy!  i&rsquo;m afraid i would have cried and let snot run down my nose and ruined the files and discorporated right there.  all you did was allow yoursef to be helped and ate a box of cookies.  that&rsquo;s not a 10 on the self destruct-o-meter (i think you&rsquo;re great.  but you know that&gt;)<br></p>

<p>For some reason I seem to be up early.  Last night I told myself to
get up the first time I woke up because I knew I couldn't finish two
full sleep cycles before I had to get ready for work and I chose to
experience a gentle transition from sleepin' to awake instead of
shattered out of bed by my alarm.</p>

<p>Then I asked for the blessing of waking up at the exact right
moment.  Here I am, groggy but awake.</p>

  I just wanted to take a brief moment to tell you that I met your Mother this past weekend at Spring Con at All Souls Tulsa. What a delightful person. We talked quite a bit and I must say that I was completely taken by her. I can see that you and Fred come by your wonderful ways naturally. Just to repeat myself, what a delightful person. Hope everything continues well in Japan, hope you havent lost your phone again, hope you havnt lost any of your innocents, I think I lost mine but it was pretty small to begin with. Good luck with your great adventure. Love,Bill(thats really bhyllx)</p>

<p>Oh gosh.</p>

<p>I *thought* I had finished my liter of OJ.  I grabbed the carton,
but it was heavier than I thought (i.e. not empty) and I almost
dropped it.... but I caught it before glushing its precious contents
onto the floor, which woulda really soured my mood (and carpet (pun
intended)).  I'm thankful that I caught it.  So thankful that I
finished the carton.</p>

<p>Just had my first paid Japanese lesson with あやな.</p>

<p>I found that if I release my mind, the words flow more easily.
Don't think; just speak.  "Untie your tongue," me-an-Wende's Spanish
teacher would say.</p>

<p>A couple of times I untied my tongue; just letting the words flow
like a heartbeat. (*)</p>

<p>I learned shit like これ, それ, あれ, どれ are used to mean generic
this, that, and that (various distances away from the speaker) and
この, その, あの, どの are used when specifying a noun "this dog" "that
dog" この　いぬ or その　いぬ.   I'm still not really certain about the uses
of どれ and どの, though.</p>

<p>Also learned some numeric stuff like hundred, thousand, ten
thousand: ひゃく, せn, まn.</p>

<p>And more more more.</p>

<p>(*) silly Vanilla Ice thinks harpoons flow.</p>

<p>There was one more thing... um......................  Oh, I think
I'll create a pronounciation guide on my site somewhere.</p>

<p>I had a dream in Japanese!</p>

<p class=dream>Homer Simpson knew Japanese; he was wearing glasses and
asking Ned to fill out a form with the prompts written in Japanese.
Between them, a woman who could read hiragana was trying to help
Ned.</p>

<p class=dream>Homer knew English but didn't translate anything for
Ned cause, being Homer, he didn't think about it and realize this
would be helpful.  He just let the woman stumble through reading the
hiragana and wondered why Ned was clueless not understanding
anything.</p>

not perfect, but...  workable.</p>

<p>up:</p>

<p>Grrrreat Voice Room today; we yammered a bit and then I introduced
the Opposite Game with them.   "What is the opposite of red?"
"Green."  "What is the opposite of blue?"  "Yellow."  (close enough)
"What is the opposite of an eraser?"</p>

<p>This is a great game for high level students.  Dammn it's the best
game ever.  Incredible super duper thanks to Wende for inventing it
with me!</p>

<p>I came up with a cheesy one.  What is the opposite of an Air
Conditioner?  Shampoo.  Why?  I added an H before Air.  Terrible pun.
Not even an opposite really.  But whatever; they liked it.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>down:</p>

<p>Soon as I got into work Steve was all, "what's going on with your
shoes?" cause I'm wearing some oh-god-say-it-isn't-so!!! light brown
leather shoes.  Man fuck that.  I lied something like, "oh, I didn't
have a chance to get home and change; I chose to be here on time than
to have my other shoes."  Bite me.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>up:</p>

<p>On the way home Clayton got on the train with one of his friends.
I tried a little bit of Japanese conversation with him.  Stuff like
what is your phone number and how old are you?</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>down:</p>

<p>Fuck!</p>

<p>I've been blessed with the opportunity to live without my bike for
an unspecified length of time.</p>

<p>Fuck fuck fuck!</p>

<p>I went to the cops and they were all, "oh no pahking zone"</p>

<p>WTF???  There's 50 fucking bicycles there right now where I parked
mine this morning and mine got jacked and those all stayed?  What the
fuck is up with that?  No signs?</p>

<p>You mean this isn't a <em>bicycle rack</em> ?????   What the hell
is it then?  A length of pole to sit on?  I don't think so.</p>

<p>I'm quite interested to know what my bike did so differently from
the other bikes.</p>

<p>They gave me a sheet of paper indicating a phone number and
bankers' hours that it's available.  I wonder what adventures are in
store for me and my bike.</p>

<p>And it's not even my bike!!!  Argh!!!!!</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>up:</p>

<p>I got ice cream on the way home to indulge myself.</p>

<p>up:</p>

<p>I arrived home (which took nearly 25 thousand times longer without
a bike!!!!!!!!!!!!!), and found a letter from janette.   :-)</p>

Dude, I have to make the hateful suggestion.  Your coworkers at Nova probably don&rsquo;t read your journal yet, but IMO you have to assume that they will eventually as they come to know you, since it&rsquo;s such an integral part of your life.  You have to assume that eventually, uncool people will read your website, and, eventually, people will see how much you disdain Steve.  Steve is not he kind of guy who will support your freedom of speech, and may have the power to mangle your career.  <br>
<br>
I can&rsquo;t suggest any more that you &ldquo;be a good boy,&rdquo; because clearly Steve is a micromanager who isn&rsquo;t capable of letting you make decisions for yourself.(<em>)  I can only suggest that you find a way to get away from him as soon as possible, because the longer you work under him, the more you will hate Nova specifically and your Japan experience generally.  None of us want that.  Find the cool important people and impress them.  See what magic they can work for you.  In the mean time, I think you should make private the things you say about him, lest they make trouble for you in the future.  I know you hate to censor yourself, and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve done an admirable job so far&ndash;I&rsquo;m sure that in your private journal there are things so poisonous as to get you fired.  I think you need to go further and, yes, censor more.  <br>
<br>
I&rsquo;ve been thinking of suggesting this ever since you started talking about Steve.  This entry seems to take things a step further than you really want to go.  <br>
<br>
(</em>)I suggest that you think of it like this:  His criticism of you simply demonstrates his own inability to be a good manager.  He comments on every little detail the same way Karen does because he is incapable of helping people grow the way you have been doing for six years and counting.  I know it grates upon everything you base your life upon, and I&rsquo;m sorry.  <br>
<br>
I hope you are getting enough satisfaction from your interactions with your students to overshadow your boss&rsquo; poor management skills.  <br>
<br>
Love,<br>
g<br>

<p>Crud.  I didn't realize how late it is.</p>

<p>I've been reading/writing email, listening to iTunes (working on a playlist
for a CD I'll burn for work) and I did laundry.  Didn't study Japanese
tonight.</p>

<p>I'm kinda stuck in that mode of
oh-god-I-have-too-much-to-do-so-where-do-I-start and instead of
starting just get sidetracked.  Ah well.</p>

<p>But I gotta go to bed so I can get up and embark on a new adventure
at Nova with the correct shoes which of course I'll need cause my bike
is awol.  Sigh.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>

<p>I practiced my flashcards.  Rode my bike to the post office and
mailed ∂≫ぎ to Janette.  Got a free lesson at work during which time I
colored kids' flash cards.  My first four cards were beautiful, with
shading and creativity.  My next eight cards were not as carefully
colored.</p>

<p>Rode my bike home zzzzzoooooooooommmm!!!</p>

<p>Studied japanese and then yammered with Janette until I fell
asleep.</p>
