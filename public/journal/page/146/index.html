<p>Wow I just had the best lesson ever with SS.</p>

<p>I reviewed &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a thing that ______&rdquo; and then got a fake phone call
on a hollow tube.</p>

<pre><code>&quot;Hello?&quot;

&quot;Oh hey what's up?&quot;

&quot;Yeah sorry I'm ______-ing right now&quot;

&quot;Okay bye&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>I then gave out a paper with 11 action images on it, including 4
screenshots of SS members performing.</p>

<p>I went through the vocab.</p>

<ol>
<li>What are you doing?  I&rsquo;m walking.</li>
<li>What are you doing?  I&rsquo;m reading.</li>
<li>etc etc</li>
<li>etc etc</li>
<li>etc etc</li>
<li>etc etc</li>
<li>etc etc</li>
<li>etc etc</li>
<li>etc etc</li>
<li>etc etc</li>
<li>etc etc</li>
<li>What are you doing?  I&rsquo;m studying.</li>
</ol>

<p>Then got another fake phone call, and went through the language again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh hey what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah sorry I&rsquo;m ______-ing right now&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay just a moment&hellip;.   it&rsquo;s for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And gave the phone to first student.</p>

<p>Then we did the full conversation.  Students rolled dice to determine
what they were busy doing.</p>

<pre><code>&quot;Hello?&quot;
&quot;HI This is Rob!&quot;
&quot;Oh hey what's up?&quot;
&quot;Are you buys?&quot;
&quot;Yeah sorry I'm ______-ing right now&quot;
&quot;Oh. okay.  May I speak to ______?&quot;
&quot;Okay just a moment....   it's for you.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>I went through each student so they could practice saying they were
busy.</p>

<p>Okay, what month is it?</p>

<p>May!!</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s play Mother May I!</p>

<p>Taking &ldquo;May I speak to ____&rdquo; apart, we have &ldquo;May I ______,&rdquo; so we practiced
&ldquo;May I&rdquo; with 3 increasingly complex versions of Mother May I.</p>

<p>version 1:</p>

<pre><code>Dice roll
Mother May I take __ steps?
Yes you may.   /   No you may not.
</code></pre>

<p>version 2:</p>

<pre><code>Dice roll
Mother May I take __ (huge|big|small|tiny) steps?
Yes you may.   /   No you may not.   You may take ____
     (huge|big|small|tiny) steps (backwards).
</code></pre>

<p>version 3:</p>

<pre><code>Dice roll
Mother May I (jump|hop|take) __ (huge|big|small|tiny) (times|steps)?
Yes you may.   /   No you may not.   You may (jump|take|hop) ____
     (huge|big|small|tiny) (times|steps) (backwards).
</code></pre>

<p>Then we still had 30 more minutes and I had run out of material, so I
designed a game to put everything together.</p>

<pre><code>Hello?
HI This is _______.
Oh HI What's up?
Are you busy?

(dice roll)

Yes.  I'm _____-ing now.
Oh, okay.  May I speak to ______?
Yes, just a moment.

No. How may I help you?
Take 3 steps.
</code></pre>

<p>We played that version a couple times as I slowly erased the
whiteboard and we had two callers asking for various people after the
callees said they were busy with various things.</p>

<p>Man I haven&rsquo;t been in a journaly mood!  Been quite prolific on Free
Code Camp dot com; I&rsquo;m up to exercise 289 or so now:
<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/sum-all-odd-fibonacci-numbers">https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/sum-all-odd-fibonacci-numbers</a></p>

<p>I finished
<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/convert-html-entities">https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/convert-html-entities</a> and
<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/spinal-tap-case">https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/spinal-tap-case</a> pretty
quickly, but I haven&rsquo;t submitted them yet; I&rsquo;m waiting for tomorrow,
my busy day in case I don&rsquo;t have time to submit anything else.  That
will give me a 6 day streak, and apparently there&rsquo;s some kind of
reward.  It&rsquo;s so weird that I gaf about the reward, but I&rsquo;m highly
curious as to what it may be!</p>

<p>Someone was recently saying that gamification of goals makes him stop
all further progress. I don&rsquo;t think that will happen to me, but we
shall see!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to finishing enough stuff to get the
<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/claim-your-front-end-development-certificate">https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/claim-your-front-end-development-certificate</a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using the following technique to do most of the recent
exercises:</p>

<pre><code>var ThingDoer = function() {

    var tdSecretVar, anotherSecretVar;

    this.publicMethod = function(param) {
        var result;

        // do something cool, perhaps with tdSecretVar and brethren

        return result;
    }

    return this;
}


globalTest() {

    var myThingDoer = new ThingDoer();

    return myThingDoer.publicMethod();

}

<p>Wow cinco de mayo!</p>

<p>Today is the third holiday in a row of Golden Week; during which I
have not needed to go to work.  I&rsquo;m just going to ignore the little
detail that I went to an empty classroom on Tuesday; derp.</p>

<p>Today I discovered freeCodeCamp, and have just finished exercise 253.  (most of the first ones were sooper easy.)</p>

<p>I used
<a href="https://goo.gl/k7Q7UQ">.reduce() to find the longest word in a sentence</a></p>

<p>We had 3 men in I-group this past Monday, and 3 men absent&hellip; so 6 all
together!  That&rsquo;s great; we&rsquo;re up 100% since August.  Yay!</p>

<p>And now I just used
<a href="https://goo.gl/fq4rEU">.map() and .reduce() to do this</a>.  Thank you
Travis, for having explained how they work that time while we were
walking to the restaurant you liked.</p>

<p>Today was my fifth lesson with SS, and it seemed like they enjoyed it.
I&rsquo;m really trying hard to use the techniques I&rsquo;m learning in my TESOL
class online, and it really seems to work!</p>

<p>This week we continued with the vocab words I presented last week.  We
didn&rsquo;t quite finish the exercise, so I said we&rsquo;ll continue next
week.. I hope that works out!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m on the ARC (Advanced Review Crew (or something)) for British
Mike&rsquo;s books.  (Playing ultimate back in the day, we had Canadian Mike
and British Mike.)</p>

<p>ABout a month ago we received the advanced review copy of <a href="https://www.michaeljohngrist.com/2016/04/the-loss-zombie-ocean-4/">The Loss -
Zombie Ocean 4</a>
and today I finished it!</p>

<p>This is the fourth book in MJG&rsquo;s Zombie Ocean, and it&rsquo;s easily the best of the series so far! The world is really opening up; the first three books have created the world from different viewpoints.. and now we get to live in it (and a few get to die in it!)</p>

<p>The first half sets up an amazing backstory for some characters who only had very minor parts in the first few books. These new characters have huge character arcs (moving me from &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; to &ldquo;I despise you&rdquo;)&hellip;. But most amazingly, I can really see why they acted the way they did! It&rsquo;s so great to see the sweet side of characters who also have such a dark side.</p>

<p>The second half of the story begins with a road trip to the big fight. It all happens in such a short timeframe, but the action never stops.</p>

<p>In addition to MJG&rsquo;s ability to create characters, he can really create some wrenching violence. Due to characters suffering such agony, I had to put the book down on two different occasions, and one of those times I nearly passed out!</p>

<p>This book follows two sets of characters in two different settings. One story is told through the Chapters, and the other story is told through the Interludes. Each story pulled me along&hellip; always hoping for the best, but assuming the worst. (Thanks, Mike!)</p>

<p>We get to see more zombie action, and the zombies do something we haven&rsquo;t seen before in any of the other books.</p>

<p>But wait, there&rsquo;s more!! More unfinished stories! More books to
come!!! I&rsquo;m looking forward to them!</p>

<p>Today I&rsquo;m making a fake FS for AB and CB (eventually) because I&rsquo;m
testing/practicing making a new one because AWS said they are going to
boot the existing one during our prime usage time.  eep!</p>
