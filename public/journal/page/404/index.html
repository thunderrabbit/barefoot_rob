<p class=dream>Reading some literature about how Amway has the finest,
most effective sales and marketing plan in the US. How they've got
distribution centers all over the place, in about 20 different states.
How I can make a pile of money in commissions selling, for example,
refrigerators to restaurants, like Jason's restaurant back when he had
a restaurant.</p>

<p class=dream>Walking with my friend Tom from I-group, wearing slacks
and button up shirt, I told him, "I've never tried to sell you on
anything, and I'll never try to sell you on anything again, if you
will just give an honest look at this program."</p>

<p class=dream>We walked to a parking lot near a tennis court, where
Fred's car was waiting.  Drove Fred's car, with the top up, with Tom
and also Robin from my I-group.</p>

<p class=dream>We headed north on FM 249 toward my dad's house, but it
was called 59 South.  I felt confused a bit when this didn't seem to
match up, so we walked a little ways while I made sure we were going
the right way.  We seemed to be, so we got back into the car, and put
the top down,  I tore out of the parking lot, engine all growling its
low roar, zipping down the hill toward the bridge out of Harris
County.</p>

<p class=dream>We were now going south on 249, and a bunch of kids
were walking on the highway, all wearing bathing suits and alternately
chasing, horesplaying, throwing towels, etc.  One towel hit the ground
and was left behind.  Nice big tan fluffy towel, so I told them as we
rolled by slowly so as to not squish any kids.</p>

<p>Tried to go back to sleep, but kept needing to write down the
dream.</p>

<p>Been at work 3 hours now; eating cold pizza for lunch.  Oksana and
Sergei are in the breakroom speaking in Russian, therefore I can't
understand them.</p>

<p>For my three hours of fun I've been backpainting facades.  Just a
flat gray paint to cover the sometimes multi-colored wood or paint on
the back.</p>

<p>I still remember how to say hello and thank you and goodbye in
Russian.  And "you are a beautiful Russian girl."</p>

<p>Ann is chillin' beside me with her huge "list of things I have to
freak out about <em>today!</em>"  She seems to be pretty helpful in
the shop.  I don't know if she acts as Johnny's brain to keep him from
forgetting stuff or what.</p>

<p class=date>1:30am CST Thursday 16 January 2003</p>

<p>Ug.  Legs are so tired; they just hurt.  Not from huge lifting, but
just from standing and walking and working.  Just got home from almost
finishing an installation at some theater in Dallas.  Ug.</p>

<p>Supposed to be back at work at 8am.  Ug.</p>

<p class=date>2:08am</p>

<p>Janette woke up when I came home; she chatted with me and heated up
some of the alfredo spaghetti they had today.  I wonder if they had
alfredo because I said yesterday that I liked alfredo most of all.
Probably so, knowing Janette and her awesomeness.</p>

<p>Today during work, I climbed up the ladder leading to the top of
the stage area.  emerged from the ladder on the first available level
(above the stage) and walked along the catwalk, which wasn't really a
very convenient catwalk.  It appeared that the catwalk had existed
when the ceiling of the auditorium was installed, but later big red
iron support beams were installed over the ceiling, many of which
severely obstruct the catwalk.  Like right at waist level a bar going
across the walkway.  Not very convenient... but now that I think of
it, a cat would be able to walk right under it without a problem.
Hmmm.</p>

<p>I traversed the catwalk despite the obstacles, and found myself
eventually on the roof of the building.  Climbed a ladder outside to a
taller roof of the building (the actual roof over the auditorium
seatings), but didn't find a way to get onto the even taller roof over
the stage itself.</p>

<p>Back into the catwalk area, I climbed further up the ladder and
found the extensive pulley system for all the curtains on the stage.
It was like they have a ton of pulleys in place just in case they need
a curtain on every imaginable part of the stage.</p>

<p>I didn't want to climb down the ladder; I had been lucky enough to
not be spotted going up the ladder (though Mongu knew I was going up;
I pointed it out to him and he was all, "der you go shun," in his
funny Mongu way) and I thought it would be cooler to find a different
way down.</p>

<p>So, back over the obstacles to the door leading to the roof, but
this time down the stairs at that point.  Ended up in the main
building, but couldn't find any unlocked entrance to the auditorium.
I searched around quite diligently, down a couple flights of stairs,
but ended up having to go outside and around to get back in.</p>

<p>Janette and I rode bikes to the bank, the library, and the grocery
store.  From the library we got _Stranger in a Strange Land_ so I can
continue reading it to her.  From grocery we got spaghetti making
items for dinner tonight.</p>

<p>Before the ride, something was bugging her; I don't know if it was
me or not.  She felt some better during the ride, but not 100% better
as she went back out alone to the park.</p>

<p>I hope she'll talk to me soon if it was something I did.</p>

<br>it&rsquo;s a little disconcerting to have my petulance,as well as my better qualities exposed to your reading public .  maybe i should:<br>
)be perfect at ALL times<br>
)be more dramatic when i fall from grace so it&rsquo;s at least a more interesting story<br>
)accept the fate of the rich and famous</p>

<p>Jack relayed the story of his adventures to Beaumont and Houston
today before our bike ride.  When we got back from our ride, he was a
bit bummed for he had learned that one of his friends was in trouble
for having visited with Jack after curfew at The Academy.  Jack
believes this cat won't be kicked out, but has concerns that maybe
Aisha's continued attendance will be adversely affected.</p>

<p>I trust that everything will work out for the best.</p>

<p>My big help with cleaning up Sean's room was picking through his
huge quantity of Legos, removing all non-Lego items.  About a quart of
non Lego stuff in three gallons worth of Legos.  Maybe only two
gallons.  Jack and Janette helped me get through the final bit of
sorting after dinner.  Then Janette vaccuumed the room; I lifted the
futon while she vaccuumed underneath it.</p>

<br>you are so strong.  it was so awesome how you just picked up the futon,and with one hand, if i&rsquo;m not mistaken.<br>
everyday jobs are more like play and less onerous with your help.</p>

<p>I'm at JiffyLube, getting Scott's oil changed.  It was a couple
hundred miles overdue.  I've only driven him once (to Wolf Shop and
back) since I arrived back in Dallas before the new year.  Today is
the second time I've driven him since then.</p>

<p>Spaghetti supper was awesomely delicious, especially with bread
that we got to twist into various shapes.  Janette braided her loaf,
and I made a twisty ring and a pretzel shape with mine.  The spaghetti
sauce was awesome with fresh mushrooms, zucchini, and oregano in it.
Wow.</p>

<p>I converted my spaghetti into alfredo spaghetti by adding a big
blop of ranch dressing.  Yummmm eeee.</p>

<p>I read some of <em>Stranger in a Strange Land</em> to Janette until
she was falling asleep.  Wrote a few emails and now I'm going to sleep
as well.</p>

<p>Going to Wolf Shop tomorrow to hopefully work some.</p>

<p>I'm at the airport to pick up Janette and Charity after they set up
a restaurant in Denver.  I think I'm just outside the right gate to
pick them up; I hope so; I moved the car twice to get lined up.  Even
drove the wrong way in the parking lot so I wouldn't have to go all
the way around again.  Whoo.</p>
