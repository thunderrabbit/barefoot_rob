<p><p>I played well at Ultimate tonight.  Not my best game by any
stretch, but certainly a lot of fun.  I made one cool catch where I
rolled from shoulder to hip, gaining several feet of ground in the
process.  One amazing, fast, low, left handed catch while running
sideways across the endzone for a point.  Very nice.  One cool catch
where I &ldquo;milked&rdquo; the disc for more distance by letting it literally go
past me at chest level and catching it from behind.</p>

<p><p>A couple of good throws, but I don&rsquo;t remember specifics.  It&rsquo;s
bedtime.</p>

<p><p>Oh!  I won the bid for a UPS from <a

retail price $299.  Less than <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> price is a pretty sweet deal!  (I&rsquo;d
say <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> price but had to pay tax and shipping.)  Just got it via FedEx
yesterday and hooked it up!  We haven&rsquo;t had a power outage to
<em>really</em> use it, but I&rsquo;m ready for one!</p>

<p><p class=dream>Sitting on the kitchen floor, I was flowcharting  a
computer program that played a graphics game on a grid..  I  had
sketched out the rules for motion in non-object oriented terms, and
then I talked to John a bit and recognized that I could make it a much
cooler program if I switched it up a bit.</p>

<p><p>Today I plan to get an early start on my day; I&rsquo;ve felt un-balanced
in different aspects of my life..  like I&rsquo;ve just been going to work
and going home exhausted.  I plan to skate for 30 minutes this
morning.  I haven&rsquo;t skated in a pretty long time.  Half of me is all
scared that I won&rsquo;t be able to go a fraction as far as I used to.  I
know this may be true the first time I skate, but if I keep it up, I
can get that energy and stamina back.</p>

<p><p>Well, we did it.  We got rings.  I was all in a quandry which I described
to Wende: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to purchase something for you to wear, but to make sure
it fits, you&rsquo;d have to try it on and then you&rsquo;d know what it is.  But I
can&rsquo;t present it to you in a romantic way without having it first.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>So I just gazed deeply in her eyes, &ldquo;Wende, I want us to get engagement
rings.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Her eyes smiled back at me with surprise.  &ldquo;You mean <em>us</em>?  You
and me?  Engagement rings?  To wear?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Yeah.</p>

<p><p>She said it was quite romantic just being asked, even though we were in
her truck in the parking lot behind the Bookstop and old Whole Foods
location.</p>

<p><p>We walked from there to Fly High Little Bunny, which sells silver jewelry
and stuff.  It&rsquo;s where I had purchased my toe rings.</p>

<p><p>We looked and found two plain silver bands that we really like.  Walked
back to the truck and then walked to Mission Burrito.  I&rsquo;m barefoot so Wende
went in a got our order while I chilled outside.</p>

<p><p>Wow!  Meg and Meagan from KTRU just walked up and said HI!  Meg is
teaching 7th grade science and described the latest perils.  Sexual
harassment between students, accusations of racism, and saving the least for
last, laser pointers.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m going to eat now.</p>

<p><p>Well, skating lasted an hour though I had allocated 30 minutes for it.</p>

<p><p>I did better than I had previously anticipated!  From our house
down Montrose to Dallas, watching the rush hour traffic speeding to
work.  Down Dallas I began to feel the bite of cool air in my throat
and lungs.  I tried to breathe through my nose as much as possible.
Down to Taft and slowly down toward Allen Parkway.  I didn&rsquo;t
consciously time the light, but it turned green for me (a tad late)
and I beat the cars into the intersection and across the &ldquo;feeder&rdquo;
road.  Pause like a lion pacing in the median for a moment to race
between cars across the first section of Allen Parkway to the next.
Another lion moment there to cross the final section of Allen Parkway.
Then slow skate around the crunchy asphalt path along Allen Parkway to
downtown.  I passed a few joggers along the way.</p>

<p><p>Downtown.  Still here waiting for me after all these months.
Louisiana street looks lovely with newly paved lanes and new traffic
lights.  No longer the kind that just stick straight up on the
corners, now it&rsquo;s got big bright lights that arch over the street.
Down Louisiana in the right hand lane that still wasn&rsquo;t completely
finished (not connected to all the parking lots and driveways) and
therefore blocked with barrels for me to skate safely.</p>

<p><p>Pausing again at the top of one of my favorite hills in Houston, I
waited for the lights to turn green.  Rush hour traffic begs for more
rushing because <em>all</em> the lights turn green on the entire street at
once.  Cars benefit from speeding so they can make one more light.  I
did not race down the hill though.  Just skated normally and let the
cars pass me.</p>

<p><p>All the way to Franklin, where I turned left and then right and
then down a sidewalk along Buffalo Bayou.  Along the bayou to
Memorial, where the sidewalk ends in a parking lot of dirt.  Up to the
street level, then up along Brazos(?) and then down down an incline
back to Allen Parkway the opposite direction.</p>

<p><p>Steady pace back along the smooth asphalt and just missed a gap in
the traffic to jump across the Allen Parkway entrance ramp from I-45.
Paused, watched, leapt across the gap to the next sidewalk.  Crunchy
sidewalk and asphalt all the way to Taft.</p>

<p><p>Traffic on this side of Allen Parkway doesn&rsquo;t have to stop at this
intersection.  They travel probably 50 or 55 miles per hour past the
Taft light.  There&rsquo;s a smooth section of sidewalk that I use like a
runway, timing my flight across the three lanes of near highway speed
traffic.  The gap in traffic arrived and I jumped off the sidewalk and
across the street to the median.  Made it no problem.  Timing was
perfect because the other direction did have a red light.  I verified
they were all stopped then sped across the remainder of the street.</p>

<p><p>Steady push push push up Taft to Dallas, then along Dallas to
Montrose.  Past a partially decayed squirrel, then past a mostly
decayed squirrel on the next block.  Feeling absolutely great to have
skated. Home now and it&rsquo;s 8:04am.</p>

<p><p>(Oh my god it&rsquo;s so cold!)</p>

<p><p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was on a train traveling through the country in the
early 1800s.  A native american &ldquo;Indian&rdquo; was on the train and planned
to ambush it as the train drove over a river.</p>

<p><p class=dream>My point of view shifted to down beside the tressel
(bridge) where a couple of junk cars (circa 1960) were all smushed and
dumped there.  As the train trucks (wheels) crossed the bridge, the
cars reverberated with a drumming sound.  The engineer got scared and
stopped the train and it was overrun by settlers who climbed up out of
the river to grab a dollar or two each.</p>

<p><p class=dream>As the settlers left their hiding spots, I went behind
them and stole the money they had already stolen.  About $51, which I
realized was almost a fortune back then.  I thought about putting it
into a retirement account in the 1850s so it would be a real fortune
in the early 2000s.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I had to get back across the river without them seeing
that I had taken their money as they all were coming back to their
homes after having robbed the train.  I just casually swam backwards,
making sure the water current would keep my swim trunks &ldquo;inflated&rdquo;
instead of mashed against my skin, thereby hiding the small wad of
bills in my pocket.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I arrived back at the train and took a shower in our
hotel room where Wende and I were staying with Christina and Lee.
After my shower, I was at Christina&rsquo;s house, and she was showing off
her stuff around the house.  Everything from the big tree in the
driveway to little bunny rabbits and their car.  I held and petted one
of the little rabbits and he was purring purring purring so loudly; it
was really surprising such a little rabbit could purr so loudly.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Someone came over with 2 little poodle dogs and they
looked all happy, but I put my ear up to the rabbit to hear him
purring and I could hear the poodles&rsquo; thoughts through the rabbit&rsquo;s
ear.  The poodles were in a pissy mood from what they were saying.</p>

should be pretty fly.  The questions on the survey need to be
displayed in different formats, so I have added a questionFormat field
to the dataset.  Right now I&rsquo;m still just drawing it out on lovely
large sheets of white paper, including some short (5 page) sections of
paper from the VAX from UH. (*) Each time a new box of paper was added
to the VAX printer, they would formfeed some sheets through to ensure
the fan-folds folded correctly.  I still have a 4 inch thick pile of
these blank sheets.  They&rsquo;re great for drawing!</p>

<p><p>The (*) above is where Peter (our cat) hurled at exactly 6:33am
because he hadn&rsquo;t been fed yet.  I fed the cats and cleaned up his
spew and now I&rsquo;m going to skate.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m at Northwoods now, about to give blood; the Blood Center happens to
be here today.  The youth were upstairs watching Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles.  They had planned for this week to be worship, but Katy did not
attend and no one stepped up to cover for her.</p>

<p><p>Someone said that this year Northwoods broke the blood donation record of
last year.  Cool.</p>

<p><p class=date>3:55 pm</p>

<p><p>Gave blood; gots lots of cookies; gave most of them to the youth.  They
were discussing morality in its most general sense: &ldquo;what are some rules
that should always apply?&rdquo;  It turned into a discussion about the morality
of the death penalty.</p>

<p><p>We cleaned the church after our meeting;  Amy and I cleaned inside the
windows on the front of the church.  She told me about her current school
stuff; volleyball, theater, harp and violin.</p>

<p><p>Driving slowly out of the parking lot, I heard a weird sound on my tire.
Found a lump on it.  I asked my angels if I could safely get home.  They
said yes.</p>

<p><p>4:02 pm</p>

<p><p>Wow!  Ben just walked up!</p>

<p><p class=date>6pm Friday 29 September 2000</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m filling in the blank here&hellip; I was at Container Store writing the
previous bit on my Handspring Visor.  Ben is a guy I met while skating some
years ago.  He&rsquo;s exceptionally cool and we may skate again sometime.  After
talking with him, I felt encouraged to skate some more, which led me to
skate early in the morning on Wednesday of this week I think.  Lemme look..
Yes.  It&rsquo;s <a
href="/cgi-local/journal.cgi?dir=2000/09&file=27Skate.html">here</a>.
Anyway, I haven&rsquo;t emailed him since then, but I will now.</p>

<p><p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>riding my bike through a scary old house / neighborhood that
I remembered (in my dream) I had been through it before.  (I don&rsquo;t know if i
have dreamed it before)</p>

<p><p class=dream>It was a run down place where some poor people lived in
poverty and I felt a bit nervous going through it, but I wound my way back
left and right turns through sneaky little rooms and openings and I got
through.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Met Wende and Tammy (ex ex ex ex ex girlfriend) once we got
out and she asked if I had found a spot to play silent football and I told
her that it was too scary in there for us to want to play in there.</p>

<p><p class=dream>She was like, okay and that was it.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Then Wende and I were driving in my old car (Olds Omega) and
she was flipping through a book .. no it was a CD by a guy from an artist we
have a KTRU a CD he had made of famous quotes being read by present day
famous people.  Wende was flipping through the lyric book as the CD played.</p>

<p><p class=dream>The guys house was right down the street, so I was going to
show up at his door and buy a CD from him.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Wende was nervous about the idea; what if he wasn&rsquo;t there or
if something bad happened..   So we pulled into a gas station (on the other
side of the street from where we would have turned to go to Chris&rsquo; house)
and the gas station turned into an old large car garage with junk everywhere
and dirt floor and a big tin building for garage.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Wende wanted to ask a question of a woman who was smoking in
the car next to us, but I was all, don&rsquo;t let any smoke get inside our car.
So Wende jumped into her car without getting smoke into our car and
actuallly got into their car.  I was surprised at this, but I figured it was
some girl talk and was okay.  In their girl talk exuberance, Wende got a
slight cigarette burn on the side of her face.  Ow!!  but she didn&rsquo;t
complain about it more than, &ldquo;hey, watch that!&rdquo; I was outside of my car
walking around and found a penny from the  year 2005 and was all, &ldquo;this must
be a dream!&rdquo; so I showed it to a guy and said what year is this penny?  &ldquo;It
expires in 2005&rdquo; he said..  &ldquo;do you know what that means?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p><p class=dream>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>&ldquo;it means I am dreaming!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>He didn&rsquo;t understand the significance.  and I said, it means
we can fly!  then Christine walked up (and I said to myself this also means
we are dreaming (!)) and I said forget flying and I started kissing
Christine on the neck and hugging her and kissing her on the neck and face.
I was totally making out with her in my dream and aware that Wende must be
sleeping beside me and I began to lose the dream and I recognized that I was
<em>actually</em> kissing Wende who way laying on top of me!  I could feel her
weight and we were kissing and I was still dreaming of kissing Christine.
Then we quit kissing and I spoke to Wende about the dream.</p>

<p><p class=dream>There was some anger, and I was all, &ldquo;it was like our dreams
crossed.&rdquo;  I was all &ldquo;did you dream about a big garage thing&rdquo;  I was going
to tell her about the 2005 penny and we really didn&rsquo;t discuss much.</p>

<p><p>Then Will called and we woke up for real.</p>
