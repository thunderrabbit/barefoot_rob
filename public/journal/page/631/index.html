<p class=date>10:07pm CST Sunday 12 March 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Eeee!!  So exciting!!  Since the last entry, we have called the
realtor/broker, scheduled a meeting with him and our realtor tomorrow
at 8am!  Wheeee!!!</p>

<p><p>Wende&rsquo;s friend Julie was all excited about it and came out to look
at the house with us.  The lights were on, so we could see right in
and show off all our cool new stairs and kitchen and cool glass brick
bathroom wall.  (&ldquo;See right in&rdquo; as much as we could see into the
second story)</p>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s so close I should be able to keep my same cool phone number,
plus moving should be a relative breeze.</p>

<p><p>- - - - -</p>

<p><p>The <em>yes</em> chimes from the spiritual level, not just
emotional giddy happy level.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like, we drove by and said, &lsquo;this
is it.&lsquo;&rdquo; says Wende.</p>

<p><p>Everything falls into place so perfectly and I am so thankful.</p>

<p><p>I mean, check the timestamp of the previous entry 5:30pm, right?
The open house was from 2 till 5pm.  We got there at like 4:30 and
just slid right in.  Yeah there were other people who looked, but they
all left without even really talking to the guy.</p>

<p><p>Us?  perfect timing.  Synchronistic to the max.  So thankful!!!</p>

<p><p>Ack!  It&rsquo;s late!</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Today&rdquo; 9am at Maggie and John&rsquo;s new house to help them move.
Munched breakfast of fruit and donuts before we headed out for the
storage unit.  (During the time they&rsquo;ve been &ldquo;between houses&rdquo;, living
with Molly and Will, most of their junk has been in a storage shed
thing.)</p>

<p><p>Three loads and 4.5 hours later, and the stuff was all at the
house.  Yay us!!</p>

<p><p>John&rsquo;s dad Ron helped me install three ceiling fans, replacing the
little light fixtures the builders used.  On the one in the gameroom,
we put one of the blades on upside down so that it&rsquo;s white, instead of
fake wood color.  Heehee!  Maggie saw it before we turned it on, but
John only saw it after we had it spinning, so he didn&rsquo;t notice!  (or
just didn&rsquo;t say anything!)</p>

<p><p>Countless giggles and fun with 4 year old Andrew, Julie and John&rsquo;s
son (different John).  He wanted to play Hide N Seek, but his version
of hiding was more like tag, and every wall was Base.  He used
&ldquo;time-out&rdquo; freely to walk between walls, and pretty much created the
rules to suit himself.  Great fun, and perfectly reminds me of Calvin
Ball from <em>Calvin and Hobbes</em>!</p>

<p><p>After yummy dinner including a smoked slab of a deer that John
shot, we cleaned up dishes and played a game of Dead Fish.  With my
3am brain, I cannot possibly describe the rules in any way that make
sense, but we had big fun.</p>

<p><p>Ice cream after that and then watched <em>The Matrix</em> on DVD!!</p>

<p><p>After watching the movie straight through, John and I watched some
of the extra special features that are also on the disk.  We were
TOTALLY impressed with how they created the amazing 3-D spin around
scenes!!  Required hundreds of cameras, and was super amazing - same
calibre of innovation as Star Wars&rsquo; stop animation back in 1975 or
whenever they filmed that.</p>

<p><p>Yay!!</p>

                        <p><title>The Monner Effect</title>
<p class=date>10:29pm CST Thursday 9 March 2000</p></p>

<p><p>I was just pondering god and spirits and Jesus and spirit-world
stuff.  This is something I often do.</p>

<p><p>I just came across a glimpse of a theory that I will call The
Monner Effect, which is pretty much a misnomer, but has a good funny
ring to it.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Monner&rdquo; is the name I used for my mom&rsquo;s mom back in the day before
I could really talk.  She (Monner), of course never complained, and I
(and all my mom&rsquo;s nieces and nephews) called her Monner the rest of
her life.</p>

<p><p>The point is, no matter what name a little infant uses for his or
her grandparents, siblings, etc, whether it be Na-na, Meme, Fiffer, or
whatever, the grandparent or sibling will accept the new name with
love and joy.  This of course assumes the grandparent or sibling
unconditionally loves the infant.</p>

<p><p>And there is the other point.  The unconditional love part.</p>

<p><p>Then the brainstorm occurred.  No matter what name we use for the
higher spirit, whether God, higher spirit, Ya-weh, Ra, etc etc etc,
God accepts the new name with love and joy.  She will because God
unconditionally loves us!</p>

<p><p>That explains to me how all different religions, all throughout
eternity have all used countless variations of names for Big G, and
all are referring to the same unconditionally loving higher spirit.</p>

<p><p>Woke up early today and mowed the lawn!  It&rsquo;s a pretty small job; it&rsquo;s a
pretty small lawn, but represents a quick $20 off my rent each month.
 Nice.  I imagined myself mowing <em>my</em> lawn (me an&rsquo; Wende&rsquo;s lawn) soon as we
purchase one.</p>

<p><p>Kinda dreaded coming into work; I don&rsquo;t want to mess with the whole
corrupt registry thing on Mickey (one of our computers).</p>

<p><p>I do look forward to continuing work on my latest SAS project!  I should
get some good feedback from my boss on it today.

<p>This will be an ongoing entry describing my contacting Microsoft
for help with NT 4.0.

<p>Yes, yes, I do not like Microsoft.  However, I will make a best
faith attempt to objectively describe what I experience.

<p>Current situation: Last night it was deterimined that the registry
got corrupted, and some environment variables were not set up
correctly.  My goal is to repair the registry, fix the environment
variables, and store the profile on our Primary Domain Controller so
that this will not happen again.

<p>I'm about to visit support.microsoft.com to find a phone number to
call.

<p class=date>10:15am</p>

<p>erp.  Found a number that costs $295 per incident to call or $1225
for a 5-pack of Incident Calls (my capitalization).  Boss has asked me
to visit online knowledge base on registry corruption first.

<p class=date>11:03am</p>

<p><p>That was anti-climatic.  Although I&rsquo;ve not fixed the problem yet.
I read on knowlege base that I can set the USER Environment variables
manually through System Icon in Control Panel.  However, when I try it
on the afflicted machine, it says &ldquo;Cannot load USER Environment
Section of registry&rdquo; Looked up that error message in one of our admin
books, which suggested rebooting and pressing spacebar to select last
known good profile.</p>

<p><p>I had suggested that to my boss last night.  Really.</p>

<p><p>The machine is busy now during the business day, so we&rsquo;ll mess with
it again (reboot it) tonight.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m normally a super happy nothin&rsquo; gets me down kinda guy.  The Feel
Good Net is cheerful and most of my journal entries are all great great
great!</p>

<p><p>Just now Wende called my cell phone, and she couldn&rsquo;t hear me talkin&rsquo;.
 She was all, &ldquo;hello?  hello?  hello?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>This is the third time this has happened, and the second time today.</p>

<p><p>I really wanted to talk to Wende; I was pissed that she couldn&rsquo;t hear
me.. I threw my phone not as hard as I could at the floor.  The battery
broke off, the flip thing over the buttons broke off, the LCD display
cracked and appears half light, half dark.</p>

<p><p>Wende called me back at work immediately (maybe it was the third number
she tried for me) and I meekly told her what I had done.  I wanted to cry.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m not having a bad day - I think I&rsquo;ve just been at work long enough
today.</p>

<p><p>See ya.</p>

<p><p>Yesterday I purchased gas for Scott.  $1.51 per gallon!!  Depending
on where you live, this may seem like nothin&rsquo;, but it&rsquo;s fully 22 cents
higher than it was last week.  Yipes!</p>

<p><p>^^^^^ That&rsquo;s just a side note.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m feeling antsy right now; just like gotta go <em>do</em> something!</p>

<p><p>So I&rsquo;m going to ride my unicycle to the bank.  I got a check in the
mail today for some computer work.  Yay!  I&rsquo;ll let you know how the
unicycling goes.</p>

<p><p>Good luck, me!</p>

<p><p>Wow.  I am officially tired.</p>

<p><p>This was certainly a feat of persistence.  On the way to the bank,
I essentially didn&rsquo;t walk at all.  At each point that I fell (stepped)
off the unicycle, I started from that same point, or at an
easier-to-start point (telephone pole, for example) behind where I
stepped off.</p>

<p><p>I deposited the check at 9:41pm (according to the bank).</p>

<p><p>I got better mps (miles per start) on the way back.  However, by
the time I was about 2 blocks from my house, I just walked the rest of
the way.  My legs are all wobbly-tired, and the sidewalk is quite
uneven.  (I used a side street instead of the sidewalk on the way
there.)</p>

<p><p>So that was it!  I&rsquo;m officially done being antsy tonight.</p>

<p><p>Have a great night!!</p>

<p><p>ACK</p>

<p><p>All day I&rsquo;ve been doing great coding here at work (all day after KTRU)
and then I was asked to reboot a machine.  I rebooted it properly I
thought, but turns out I mis-chose one of the startup options.</p>

<p><p>Ack ack ack ack</p>

<p><p>30 minutes in mental agony standing behind my boss as he tried to figure
out how to fix it.  I had no idea how to help, AND I&rsquo;m supposed to be
somewhere at 6:30.</p>

<p><p>I called my 6:30 group and told them I&rsquo;d be late; they were okay, but it
didn&rsquo;t fix anything here.</p>

<p><p>Ack ack ack</p>

<p><p>So he fixed it temporarily, and now I&rsquo;m asked to figure out why it broke
in the first place.  The registry is corrupted, and some environment
variables have no values.  causally related?  or just stupid microsoft?</p>

<p><p>With Love anyway&hellip;

<p><p>Welp, Wende and I looked at the little house across the street.  I
thought it was cool, but she found the bedrooms to be too small, and it had
an extra garage thingy converted to a dog/cat grooming salon.  She felt it
would be wasted space, and realistically, she&rsquo;s right.</p>

<p><p>We requested from Diane our credit ratings, to see what kind of loan we
could get and stuff like that.  Haven&rsquo;t heard back from her yet.</p>

<p><p>And we decided we need more cashola.  So I&rsquo;ve requested to increase my
hours at work, and my bosses are ecstatic at the idea!  Tomorrow I will
discuss with them the possibility of working full time and therefore going
to salary instead of hourly, and being added to health insurance.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ll have to figure out what salary I would like.</p>

<p><p>Part of this need for cashola stems from me overdrawing my checking
account today.  Wende bailed me out with $300, which I intend to pay back
on the 15th, but dang it pisses me off that I did that so stupidly.
 Actually it was paying or this here website that threw me off.  I got 3
months free web hosting and then prepaid $215 for the year and I totally
didn&rsquo;t record it in my thingy.  Doh!!!!</p>

<p><p>Today at work I reviewed two CDs with the entertaining help of Jason.
 We found Slotek&rsquo;s CD <em>7</em> dark mysterious stuff.  Jason said it made
him think of dead people playing music.</p>

<p><p><em>soulsharks</em> by gitbox! (or is it <em>gitbox!</em> by
soulsharks?) was crap.  depressing lyrics with bad singing.</p>

<p><p>And last <em>the great indoors</em> by star ghost dog - just girl-rock,
and I wasn&rsquo;t too impressed.  At least it wasn&rsquo;t angry-girl-rock.   Holly
likes girl-rock much more than I; I may give it to her tomorrow to review.
 They sounded a lot like Cranberries to me.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ve been working on some SAS programming today.  Learning a lot of
stuff&hellip; this is the first SAS code / SAS database project that I have
written essentially from scratch.  I&rsquo;m fairly pleased and impressed with
this first effort!</p>

<p><p>Have a great and lovely day!</p>
