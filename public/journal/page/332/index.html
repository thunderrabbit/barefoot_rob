<p>This morning in Musashi-Kosugi, I heard a desperate squealing
squeeching sound overhead.  A single pigeon doing a pigeon dance up on
the interior framework of the station didn't have any discernable
problem from my point of view.  Both feet were intact and mobile; both
wings were retracted normally.  I offered up a mental bird blessing
then got on my train.</p>

<p>Today is the first Saturday for me to work at KQ.  Last month I
worked there on Mondays and Fridays.  This week it's Saturdays, which
are super busy at Kawasaki.</p>

<p class=date>6:41pm</p>

<p>Today was my first day to work at KQ on Saturday.  Kinda busy, but
nothin' like Kawasaki.  I had one free lesson during which I handed
out some Nova Usagi tissues and played Marble Blast.  The graphics are
so good (or so fucked up) on the game that it made me a little
urpy.</p>

<p>I'm on a train now to Shinagawa and then will zip over to Shinjuku
to meet with Yumi at Gateway 21.</p>

<p>Lesson with Yumi was hilarious.  Two hours like nothin'.  Well 1.5
hours like nothin, and I noticed the last 1/2 hour.</p>

<p>Filled 7 pages of notes.  Lots of laughs, funniest of which was our
closure.  She solemnly said, "thank you very much," as I solemnly
said, "arigato gozaimas."  Then she answered "you're welcome," as I
replied "doitashimashite."  Hilarious.</p>

<p>I'm falling in love.</p>

<p>"Um, Rob," in answer to "what's your name?"</p>

<p><em>Why my name?  ...  oh, cause Stephanie is more difficult to
spell.</em></p>

<p>Lots of similar thought patterns.  Nova bad.  Clear emotions good.
Marriage too soon bad.  Marriage when = ?</p>

<p>Pricking her finger doesn't hurt anymore.  The receptors seem to
have given up.  She's supposed to use a clean needle every time.</p>

<p>HahaAHAhahaahaaahhahaahhah!  That was a good laugh.</p>

<p>Art, Japan, culture, Blue Man Group, dreams, goals, past stories,
((religion vs) spirituality), changing the face of Japanese history,
"we're the Joneses," and then oh my gosh what time do the trains stop?
It's 12:30!</p>

<p>The clock at TGIFriday's was an hour fast, fortunately, but even
so, time seemed to have flown by.  Though we didn't get off work until
9pm.</p>

<p>I worked at Tsurumi and gave my email address to one student, but
not another.  Maybe should have switched it, given their levels.  7B
and 3.</p>

<p>Got on the same train she took from Kawasaki to Yokohama.  The
phone system didn't really work, but I saw her as the train was coming
to a stop.</p>

<p>I have heard that Japanese supress their emotions in order to show
their integrity of character.  I have heard that Japan has the highest
suicide rate in the world.   I imagine these issues are linked.</p>

<p>I believe the new warrior training has something that can help
Japanese release their emotions in a way that maintains personal
integrity while resolving internal issues before they drive a person
to death in front of a train.</p>

<p>Training for life instead of being trained to death.  Haha.  That's
sick.</p>

<p>I have written to my I-group and Kim Sawyer for encouragement and
ideas, etc.  This is a worthy task.  I feel pretty daunted by it.</p>

<p>Miki is a student who said she wanted to meet me.  I told her I
have a girlfriend and she still wanted to meet me so I emailed her and
was like, "I dunno who you are, but hi"  (I got her address from Bill
who said she wanted to meet me).  She said she would say "I'm Miki"
next time she sees me at work.  Today was that day.  <em>ah</em> I've
seen you.</p>

<p>Chatted with Stephanie at lunch today.  We share a similar unlove
for Nova.  She seems pretty clear that she's not enjoying her
experience here - doesn't know if she'll make it past a month.</p>
