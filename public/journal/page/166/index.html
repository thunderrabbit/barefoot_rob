<p>I arrived late, just in time to see Soness present her story,
including many details I hadn&rsquo;t heard before.  I felt really pleased
to be mentioned at the end of her story as the only person who was
consistently there to listen when she was recovering from divorce.</p>

<p>Funny thing was that I was off to the side where 90% of the people
couldn&rsquo;t see me. (Because I rocked up barefoot, I was asked to stay
put, as well.  Fair enough.)</p>

<p>Good munchies (boneless fried chicken and other stuff I couldn&rsquo;t
readily identify, plus some thinly sliced meat over cantelope) at the
end, though I didn&rsquo;t completely load up because I thought I&rsquo;d look
like a pig while eating and feel too full afterward.</p>

<p>Got to talk to Yuji for a good deal of the evening after all the
speakers spoke.  Last was Akebono, a Hawaiian-born Hawaiian who became
a the first foreign sumo champion ever.  He was pretty down-to-earth
relating in his speech how he likes to make someone smile each day.</p>

<p>Got to speak with Yoshiko, former owner of Ben&rsquo;s Cafe, who now is
doing photography after making movies for a while.  While she and Yuji
spoke, I asked if I could give her reiki, which she accepted and said,
&ldquo;wow, [your hands are] so warm!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yup.  Every time I do reiki.  Plus it was warm in the room.</p>

<p>Lesson tonight featured four students, including Bob, Michael, George,
and Edgar, the English names of Yuta, Hirofumi, Ryo, and Masao.  We
reviewed &ldquo;pumped&rdquo; and Bob practiced answering &ldquo;it was fine&rdquo; for some
questions of the form &ldquo;how was (it)?&rdquo; because when I asked &ldquo;How was
the party?&rdquo; he originally answered, &ldquo;I was fun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Homework will be for each of them to create something and bring it (or
a picture) to show and talk about it.</p>

<p>OKay so I have a lot of audio files in XCode for the project we&rsquo;re
making.  They are recordings of words for pronunciation practice.</p>

<p>I needed to add some more files for &ldquo;similar words,&rdquo; two of which
ended up being the same words as the original words.</p>

<p>XCode lets me drag files in from Finder and index them into the
project.  So I dragged in 120 files andddd I get an amazing error
message like, &ldquo;one or more errors occurred while importing files&rdquo;</p>

<p>Okay, so the files weren&rsquo;t imported.  I&rsquo;ll just import the correct
ones, right?  Wrong!!</p>

<p>Though the files were not <em>index</em>, they were spammed into the
directory of the project, and XCode doesn&rsquo;t know about them!  They&rsquo;re
not visible in XCode so imagine the joy of dragging in a file that
doesn&rsquo;t exist in XCode but <em>does</em> exist in the underlying directory!</p>

<p>This has been a problem for years and still isn&rsquo;t fixed.  Emacs can
deal with it; Sublime can deal with it; Netbeans can deal with
it.. and those are just the ones I know because I&rsquo;ve used them!  Why
can&rsquo;t Apple&rsquo;s own product deal with Apple&rsquo;s own file system?</p>

<p>Today I created a post for
<a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/3912777">White Dots</a> on Patreon.  I&rsquo;m
not sure if the piece is finished, but it&rsquo;s close!</p>

<p>Today I added tiny dots around the white dots (and other colors),
added the squiggly yellow line that ended up being shaped something
like the kanji for mountain: 山, and drew straight-ish lines under the
yellow squiggle and under its kanji.</p>

Sarumama.  They&rsquo;re both progressing nicely, nearly enough for me to be
inspired to study Japanese but gah I&rsquo;m soo dumb (that I don&rsquo;t).</p>

<p>Like the little maze I received because it was broken, but a lot
bigger, there&rsquo;s a cool rotating maze at the toy store.  It&rsquo;s
essentially two radial mazes side by side, with two radial mazes on
top of them, geared together so they must turn in anti-unison.  Two
balls live under plexiglass fixed to the top of the upper mazes and
the goal is to get them out, through two holes in the plexiglass.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t able to solve it today, but I didn&rsquo;t give up; I had to leave
for MM lessons.</p>

<p>Toy store said they didn&rsquo;t find my MOOV.  Same response at the conveni
where I&rsquo;m writing.  Boo.</p>

<p>Hmmm.  Last night the idea of presenting at Pecha Kucha came to mind.
Could be a good place to speak about authenticity</p>

<p>Some fragments came to mind while walking to the station</p>

<ul>
<li>I like walking barefoot   (on beach)</li>
<li>Not just on the beach but everwhere I can (collage of barefeet walking)</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t worry about what people think</li>
<li>Just be happy</li>
<li>Not always happy</li>
<li>Sometimes life can be surprising   (surprise snake)</li>
<li>What if we could talk about it?</li>
<li>Not to a mirror, but to a person who listens</li>
<li>What if we take time to sit and just be  (black screen)</li>
<li>Sometimes we might find monsters</li>
<li>but it turns out they&rsquo;re just unheard sadness</li>
<li>I broke my shoulder             (x-ray picture)</li>
<li>Had just meditated so wasn&rsquo;t bothered</li>
<li>I lost my rabbit       (Francois picture)</li>
<li>found him all cleaned up and repaired on Ebay!</li>
<li>Life&rsquo;s little mysteries   (factory production line thousand copies Francois)</li>
<li>Sometimes people fight like this (not listening picture)</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m afraid.  scared to come up here.</li>
<li>Can I tell you that?  Can I be honest with you?</li>
<li>Will you still like me?   Still listen to me?</li>
<li>My pessimistic side says you won&rsquo;t.  I&rsquo;ll be booed off stage and I&rsquo;m doing it wrong and no one will understand and it will just be terrrible</li>
<li>But I can&rsquo;t control other people&rsquo;s responses.  More important question:</li>
<li>Will I still like myself?</li>
<li>You know when you walk barefoot outside in the city and you step on a piece of glass and you have to ask your wife to dig in there with a needle to pull it out, and you&rsquo;re just lying there feeling helpless with a needle near a sensitive part of your body? I mean the feet!</li>
<li>Probably not.  That&rsquo;s why I encourage people to use &ldquo;I-statements.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Sometimes, when I walk outside in Tokyo, I step on a piece of glass and can feel it lodged in my foot.  I limp for the rest of the day and then ask my wife to dig in there with a needle to pull it out.<br /></li>
<li>But I don&rsquo;t feel helpless, because I trust her.</li>
<li>Can I trust her with my soul?  Sure; it&rsquo;s eternal. What about my feelings and emotions?  Uh oh!  Scary!</li>

<p>I&rsquo;m barefoot today because I don&rsquo;t have to wear shoes until 6:30pm.  A
guy hung up his phone to talk to me a bit after he was like, &ldquo;hey are
you okay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He used to be a kickboxer and now has a bar in Roppongi.  I didn&rsquo;t get
the deets but maybe I&rsquo;ll see him when I head out to The Pink Cow this
week.  He was like, &ldquo;why is everybody talking about The Pink Cow?&rdquo;
Fair enough question!  I explained &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a really cool place to hang
out and meet people over drinks, great food, and great entertainment!&rdquo;</p>
