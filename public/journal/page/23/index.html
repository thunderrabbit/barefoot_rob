<p>Super nice: I was able to figure out how to create a function to
simplify the creation of web pages for Marble Track 3
Parts](<a href="https://www.marbletrack3.com/parts/">https://www.marbletrack3.com/parts/</a>).  Now I just type <code>C-c p</code>
in Emacs, then enter the title, tags, and shortcode to produce a file
for a new Part in the Marble Track 3 website.</p>

<p>Today, with said shortcode, I started the page for
<a href="/p/mcbts">Medium Catcher Below Triple Splitter</a>.</p>

<p>I am on the way home after my last 2018 lesson at JB.  I thought we
had lessons next week, but apparently not!  I kinda sorta wish we did
have to work next week; the monies would be nice, but I guess I can
work on AB during that time.</p>

<p>For over a year, I have had gaps in my schedule on Wednesdays between
teaching at Solid Square in Kawasaki and teaching at JB in Kawsaki.
Usually I bring my computer and work in a cafe, but today is the
second time I have worked in an <em>internet</em> cafe, which features my own
private space with a padded floor for sleeping, free wifi, free
shower, free drinks, and <em>free ice cream</em>.</p>

<p>Granted, it is soft serve ice cream, but it&rsquo;s nice that I have the
option to actually lay down for a snooze.</p>

<p>I had searched for a private workspace a couple times, then Lin
suggested a cafe a few weeks ago.  nice.  こんど we will hang out here
together, where the joke is &ldquo;こんど means never&rdquo; though is literally
&ldquo;next time&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dang.  I cannot seem to get Godot to detect collisions; I have some
phsyics bodies fixed on the screen but dragging other physics bodies
goes right through them.</p>

<p>Still working on our <a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi/">open source Godot game, ConSwi</a> (which I think is
the perfect name, my partners are both saying they want a longer name
that is more descriptive), I got piece dragging to follow the mouse
properly.  Originally I had the drag only active when the cursor was
over the piece, so if the mosue went too quickly, the piece would no
longer receive the input and lose track of the piece.</p>

<p>Now I have refactored the code that was used to catch what I called
&ldquo;Orphaned Swipes,&rdquo; meaning swipes that were released out in the play
field as opposed to exactly on the last piece.</p>

<p>OrphanSwipeCatcher is now GameSwipeDetector, and is now its own class,
which allowed me to move a decent amount of code out of Game.gd and
allowed drags to be detected even if the drag point moved off of the
piece being dragged.</p>

<p>This refactor is still in progress; there are some more functions
related to swipes and drags that can be moved to GameSwipeDetector.</p>

<p>Special thanks to Godot for dealing with memory management and
allowing my semi-noodled-code so I can focus on functionality of the
game.  I can imagine Travis&rsquo; shock when he reads that!</p>

<ul>
<li>Marble Track 3 has its own domain, <a href="https://www.marbletrack3.com/">https://www.marbletrack3.com/</a>
hosted as a static site on Netlify</li>
<li>ConSwi is open source under GNU copyleft.  Several outstanding issues,
the biggest of which are
<a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi/issues/25">#25 disallow dragged pieces to go through other pieces</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi/issues/23">#23 Make piece keep up with mouse when dragging</a></li>
<li>I created a
<a href="https://www.patreon.com/marbletrack3">Patreon page for MT3</a> and
have my first patron, Jimmy!</li>
<li>I recently got the fans and battery replaced on my MacBook, but it
still conks out when the battery is at 65%.  I let it run all the
way down to 0 after charging all the way, and did cmd-shift-p-r on
boot.</li>
<li>I have not been writing journal entries very consistently recently</li>
<li>Working on AB, trying to get the code base for both sites up to
snuff with MLAPHP</li>
<li>Working on TY, trying to get the new students up to speed</li>
<li>Marble Track 3 has six (6) different supports for the outer spiral,
and they each have webpages on the website, with shortlinks so I can
refer to them easily enough <a href="https://www.marbletrack3.com/p/1poss">https://www.marbletrack3.com/p/1poss</a> -
<a href="https://www.marbletrack3.com/p/6poss">https://www.marbletrack3.com/p/6poss</a>  The /p/ stands for &ldquo;parts&rdquo; as
in &ldquo;parts of the track&rdquo; and Nposs stands for the Nth Placed Outer
Spiral Support.</li>
<li>C and E have their wedding party soon (this coming Thursday)</li>
<li>Lin and I had a date tonight, eating ramen at a local cheap ramen
shop.  They deal with money by having a vending machine that
dispenses colored plastic cards which tell what we ordered.  The
cards are as thick as poker chips, but round-rectangular</li>
<li>Jennie is our cat.  She goes in and out through her cat door on the
2nd floor, which leads to the balcony and her little cat stair-bench
to the roof, to the tree, to the ground (and back).</li>
<li>The Marble Track 3 site is on version 2 now, which focuses on the
characters making the site instead of on me making the site.  I
think it is more interesting this way, but it still needs a tweak
before I am like &ldquo;yep&rdquo;.  The top page isn&rsquo;t right yet..  Currently
shows my inspiration for starting the project, but should show
<em>their</em> inspiration (or something), but I do not yet know what that
is.</li>
<li>Lucifer is in its 3rd season, so I have started watching it on Netflix, so far
not bingeing.</li>
<li>I plan to binge the hell out of Rick and Morty seasons 3 - 99 when
they are available.</li>
<li>My primary non-static web provider said my wiki dedicated to Castle
of Dreams was using too much memory.  I need to convert it to a
static site and let people edit it via git.  Fack when will I ever
make time for that?</li>
<li>Been talking to Dora about getting business started.  She introduced
me to <a href="https://www.danpena.co.uk/">Dan Peña&rsquo;s site</a> and it&rsquo;s like damn.</li>

<p>Yikes I derped and did not do my task for TY.  First time, but I will
definitely not miss again.</p>

<p>JB classes were fun; we used fake money notes as money in the 4:30pm kids
class (Suzu, Kanta, Toshiro), and then I used them again in 8pm adult
class (Misato, Kaori).</p>

<p>Working on ConSwi now, refactoring to make pieces move themselves
down, and get a ton of code out of the main

<pre><code>In 2017, Masuda Futoshi was fined 150,000 yen for tattooing customers
without a medical license.

Recently, the Japanese high court reversed the decision.

Tattoos have historical and artistic significance.  Tattoos are social
customs in modern society.  Therefore the court decided ”tattoos are
fundamentally different from medical work.”

Tattoos have traditionally been an art form for many years.  The
decision to call them medical treatment is hard to defend.

The debate is not over.  Yasuhiro Tanabe, the prosecutor said, &quot;we
will respond appropriately after studying the judgment.&quot;
