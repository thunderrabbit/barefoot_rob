<p>Usually when I run, my backpack goes wagga-wagga-wagga-wagga from
side to side, kinda throwing me off balance.</p>

<p>This morning I was on the bicycle side of the street, impatiently
waiting for a break in traffic.</p>

<p>Heard a train, looked up and saw my train sailing over my head.
"I'm gonna catch that train."</p>

<p>Exploded across the street then full out <em>sprint</em>ed, as fast
as possible to catch that train.  No bag waggling.  All pendulum wave
forms merged to a slight vibration.  Feet: ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta on
the pavement.  People: part like a sparse red sea.</p>

<p>Dogleg curve (can kill a man) between the posts into the station.
Wallet out, ticket out, ticket in, grab ticket, run upstairs against
the flood of people coming down.</p>

<p>Doors-closing bell ringing.  Hand goes in the door (so at least my
fingers will take the train).  I make the train.</p>

<p>Ooooo sheen of sweat sneaks out on my head and torso.  Breathe.
Relax.  Hmmm don't pass out.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>By the time I got on the next train at Musashi-Kosugi, I was pretty
much fine.</p>

<p>I spent all my cash down to 6 yen last night.  I didn't want to
withdraw money during the weekend (105 yen service charge), and
somehow I was able to pay for lunch with some of the guys (Cory, Guy,
Jon M) from work at a miso place, spend five hours online, and get
orange juice and chocolate on the way home.</p>

<p>I shaved my head again.  Shaving 3 weeks worth of growth with a
disposable razor was ....... challenging.  I won't likely try it
again.</p>

<p>I missed a couple spots that I'm about to fix now.</p>

<p>Much better day at work today than yesterday.  I didn't extract a
quote of the day, but there were a few doozies during voice when this
guy was totally ....  strange.</p>

<p>He totally domintated the conversation though he didn't seem to be
jiving with anything the other students' concepts of anything.  They
were all "wtf are you talking about?" all while being quite polite, as
Japanese are prone to be.  One guy, a level four, was all quiet,
saying he had no idea what the conversation was about.  I don't quite
believe that, but whatever.</p>

<p>Cory basically challenged me into going to lunch with him and two
other guys and I'm glad he did.  I went at the expense of spending
time trying to think of what to write in students' files, which always
vexes me, so I just didn't think and either wrote nothing (one of my
preferences on the weekend) or scribbled some shit down, which is
certainly just as useful as making some shit up.</p>

<p>"You guys go on without me; I have to write these files; it will
take me about a month."</p>

<p>"Nah mate, I'll see you downstaihs in <em>two</em> minutes."</p>

<p class=dream>Went home early.  I did something wrong at work and
they were like that's it you're outta here and I was like whoohoo! but
I wanted to surprise janette so I didn't tell her, but I had to get
home from the airport some way, so I called Fred, or I was going to
ride my bike to his house, but he had to get it from her house first
without telling her he was getting it, nor why if she found out and I
was in my old neighborhood and a dog was yapping so I took off its
lower jaw and started to eat some of the meat (tasted like chicken)
and it was cooked so it wasn't gross and the next dog wanted some so I
fed him some to keep him quiet and the first dog wasn't upset, but was
hungry so I fed him some meat, but not his own jaw cause he wouldn't
be able to chew the bones and then I threw the jaw into the trash, but
realized that they would find it and do DNA analysis on it and know it
was me, so I had to run away and I was climbing over fences in my old
neighborhood but I kept having to come back cause I forgot something
and I finally made it down toward the creek and janette was planning
to go to a skinhead type show out in the woods where they were going
to burn a bunch of machines not like robots but mechanical stuff to
show humans' superiority and I wasn't really interested but I wanted to
see her and maybe there was some benefit from seeing this performance
that I didn't understand yet</p>

<p>And then I woke up and was <em>really</em> relieved to have not
ripped off the dog's jaw, nor have to attend a skinhead
destruct-o-show.</p>

<p class=date>4:48am</p>

<p>Just bought shave cream and woke my body up and hope to sleep with
lucid dreams or better.</p>

<p class=dream>Cory was all, "I had a look at your website, and it's
pretty interesting, your website."</p>

<p class=dream>He pointed at the window, which indicated he had read

<p>Right when I walked into work I was in a horrible mood.  Pissed off
did *NOT* want to be there, could not *stand* Benny's continuous
self-aggrandizing blather- putting others down etc, *Hated* the people
standing in front of the schedule (even Eric, whose one of the most
soft spoken integrous people at work), wanted to destroy the filing
system, etc etc etc etc.</p>

<p>As I copied down my schedule, I wrote "fuck off bitches" where I
usually write "ebark" or "barke" or "bekar" or some other anagram.</p>

<p>That was my little way of acting out without noticably destroying
anything.</p>

<p>My mood jumped up a happy notch when my first class was a no-show.
It slowly got better from there including my very last class where I
spent an extra 11 minutes with this guy who's going to Portland in
September.  He's about a 7A, but wants to learn how to reserve hotel
rooms, etc.  I think I really helped him a lot.</p>

<p>Quote for the day, after the previous person had said, "I can't
think of anything"</p>

<pre>
I think the same thing.

<p>Today after work, riding the train home with Cory, I decided to
forge ahead with signing up with Yahoo! BB, not waiting for some
friend who can speak Japanese to help.  "I'll test the Japanese
customer service and see what I can get them to do for me.  I'll just
hand over my bank book and my gaijin card and be like, 'hook me
up!'"</p>

<p>Previously, I had seen a Y!BB table set up outside the Tokyo Hands
(?) store.  It was there tonight and I talked to a cat named Toshihiko
I think, who explained in pretty decent English what it would take to
get signed up.  First we gotta get a phone line with NTT. Actually
there is a line in the apartment, but we have to buy or rent a line
from them.  (I still don't really understand buying a phone line,
unless that means buying/renting a phone number, similar to buying a
domain name online)</p>

<p>He called NTT for me, but they've gone home for the night, and will
go home before I get off work tomorrow.  So on Monday at 11am I'll go
back to the Yahoo! BB table and talk to the staff person there, who,
according to Toshihiko, speaks pretty good English.</p>

<p>Rock on.</p>

<p>I'm thankful to have my small room at the front of our apartment.
It's just off the entry way, opposite the bathroom.  A door separates
the entry area from the living room.  Frank and Matty have their rooms
on either side of the living room.</p>

<p>I'm thankful because Frank and Matty have the air conditioner set
to Stun.  It's like a fucking ice factory in their area.</p>

<p>I've just got my window open and a fan blowing.</p>

<p>PLUS, outside the air is SO NICE right now!  There's a blustery
breeze like that which announces the arrival of a storm (not that a
storm is coming, but that's what it reminds me of), and it's just
lovely.</p>

<p>Aight; I gotta roll for Japanese lessons with Ayana.   I didn't do
as much pre-writing of sentences as last week, but I did some last
night.</p>

<p>I have just finished my lesson with Ayana in Shibuya.  I was way
distracted during the lesson.  My emotional body is all awry.  I think
crying may help.  brb.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Crying helped a bit I think.  Or maybe a bit of crying helped a
lot, possibly what seems an incredible amount of goodness for a tiny
bit of crying.</p>

<p>Possibly there's more to emotions than I totally understand.</p>

<p>("Haha that is joke.")</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>When Ayana could tell I was distracted, she asked "are you sure
you're okay?" and I could just feel the emotion on the edge of
exploding out, no I feel like bawling cause I haven't hugged anyone
since I've been here.  Haven't trusted anyone enough to hug a real hug
like in I-group.  A fake hug would be just pointless and patronizing
to my need.  A sex hug would be relatively easy to get, but I don't
really want that.</p>

<p>Oh hey, Frank is back in town.  I might (haha there's another
word-fuck) talk to him about his connections with men through AA.</p>

<p>Cory has sold me on getting Yahoo! BB at the apartment.  He says we
get the first couple months free *and* that includes free
international calls.  FREE.  After the first couple months the calls
are less that what I'm paying with Brastel, my calling card.  Rock
on.</p>
