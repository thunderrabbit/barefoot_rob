<p>Sally showed me where she used to live in Huntington Beach,
basically midway between Newport Beach (her current digs) and LA.  We
had two cups of hot chocolate</p>

<pre>
("Would you like some more?"
"Yeah, gimme three.")
</pre>

<p>each, and split a pile of apple pancakes with banana and peanuts
and whipped cream.  Quite yummy.</p>

<p>Saw a house shaped like a medeival castle overlooking the beach,
and saw where the real Navy Sals train and such.  Awesome.</p>

<p>Saw fantastic waves coming to meet the shore along the asphalt path
that winds along the beach for hours...</p>

<p class=note>(4am dream)</p>

<p class=dream>Driving on a road that had been just freshly poured,
like fresh asphalt had just been layed down where previously there was
only grass and a forest, I felt so bad for the animals who would be
cut off from their buds on the other side of the road,   but I was
forced to use this road for some reason to get someplace I had been to
before using other roads in the past.</p>

<p class=dream>On the map the roadway system looked like a big loop
with a diagonal stripe through it, where the diagonal was the new
road.</p>

<p>There was far more to this dream, and I thought, 'oh I'll remember
it.'</p>

<p>False.</p>

<p class=note>(7am dream)</p>

<p class=dream>In a small cabin type thing which was a medical
research lab as well.  With a guy who I just recently met, and a woman
researcher/nurse was there as well.  There had been mosquitos biting
us earlier and she talked about some diseases that could be carried by
mosquitos during certain times of the year, and that three years ago
ended a few year stretch where bewtween June 20 and July 4th, people
(especially babies) could get a disease from a mosquito bite.</p>

<p class=dream>She told us that there had been an immunization for it
and that the outbreak didn't happen much anymore.  But that she was
interested in seeing if we had the immunization genese in our DNA.</p>

<p class=dream>She told us, 'here each of you give me a DNA sample in
these cups,' told us to just turn around and each masturbate into a
cup.  People started walking in before I finished so I was all trying
to get some privacy, but I couldn't ever get a private moment long
enough to complete this project.</p>

<p class=dream>Someone walked in so I pulled my pants up, and it was
Meg Robinson who came in and I had been laying down behind the counter
in the dark, and she was all, "oh, you got hit in the balls; I hate
when that happens.." and ducked back out.</p>

<p class=dream>Then another girl was all, "can you help me?" and had
all this hair care products or something and I gave up my little
project and was all, "um sure"</p>

<p class=dream>Before I helped her, I was all, "you know what's
weird?"</p>

<p class=dream>"what?"</p>

<p class=dream>"today I just met Tony Hawk"</p>

<p class=dream>"!!!!"</p>

<p class=dream>"And it was no big deal to me.  I was just all 'HI
Tony, nice to meet you.'"</p>

<p class=dream>"YOU <em>MET</em> TONY HAWK????"</p>

<p class=dream>"I can see from your reaction that you would have been
a bit more excited about meeting him..  Anyway, I was just like, meh
and didn't really get excited at all.  Why do we individuals each have
different celebrities that make us really excited to meet them?"</p>

<p>YES!!!</p>

<p>Thanks to Marcel's suggestion, buried in a tome of wit, I figured
out how to <a
href="https://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20020708094743450">change
the port that OS X mail app uses to send mail</a> because Kinko's has
blocked port 25.</p>

<p>I also therefore had to see how to tell robnugen.com to <a href="https://www.sendmail.org/~gshapiro/8.10.Training/DaemonPortOptions.html">use another
port to listen to email</a>.</p>

<p>Searched for DaemonPortOptions in the sendmail.cf and found that an
alternate port had already been set up!!  Whoooo!</p>

<p>Now why didn't tech support at webquarry tell me about the
alternate port when I told them I was having problems???</p>

<p>Ah well; I don't care; I'm happy to be back in emailland again!</p>

<p>Sally and I totally went sailing today; it was so much fun!  It was
in a Lido, about a 12 foot boat with two sails.  I got to drive the
jib sail (small one in front) and then once we got out to the turning
basin she invited me to drive the tiller, and then the main sail.</p>

<p>I was pretty nervous at first, but to some degree found it second
nature, I think.  There were some points where I didn't know what to
do, but I got better after some practice.</p>

<p>In addition to sometimes having no wind, we found that part of the
difficulty was that the downward pointing board (centerboard) was not
pointing all the way down.  "That's why we kept sliding sideways!"</p>

<p>Kinda cold near the end, but I survived.</p>

<p>Tacking is interesting; I think I've got the hang of it mostly.</p>

<p>We got back just in time before the sky went pretty dark due to the
sun having already set some minutes previously.</p>

<p>Great great fun!</p>

<p>The night sail didn't happen cause there was no wind.  But I hung
out with Michael, Elizabeth, Jeff who were there to sail.</p>

<p>We shared some funny culture stories ranging from wasabi ice cream
(bryn) to Japanese toilets (research to see from where the water
squirts and get a shot in the face) to saleditos (sp!) (spanish
salt-encrusted plums ("that's rather salty")) to the languages spoken
in Germany (no one speaks true German, only localized dialects)</p>

<p>Saw a well decorated boat go by.  Lights arrranged like an inverted
cone up front made a Christmas tree, and then two palm trees of lights
in the back and three levels of icicle lights hanging around the
entire boat.  Pretty neat.  I took a mental picture of it.</p>

<p>Heard some interesting popping sound over by the interface between
the dock and stairs leading down to the dock.  Michael theorized it
was the open lid of the supply box rubbing against the steps, but I
imagine he (like me) thought it was a bit loud for that.</p>

<p>Turns out that as tide was coming in, the open lid was getting
compressed under the stairs as the dock was being raised by the water.
Jeff popped the lid out from under the stairs and the dock/stairs
jumped three inches toward one another (measurable by how far down the
lid would have to go to get back under the stairs).  Wow!!</p>

<p>Got to Sally's about 30 minutes ago and shared stories; hers was
far more stressful than mine, and continues to be so.  For multiple
days (weeks?) she's been working on this large poster (44 x 56 inches)
for her graduate advisor for this conference he's attending this
weekend.  He's been really hounding her to get it finished and at one
point even said it looked like crap (how supportive is that??
Advisor.  Pshhh). Yeah I know it's for a big conference and such but
no one is going to fucking die if the thing doesn't look perfect; he
should just chill the fuck out.</p>

<p>Anyway she's done a ton of work on it, but the guys at the printing
place are having trouble with it, so when she called to check on it
she got all stressed and somewhat freaked that she'll lose her job if
it's not perfect and done on time so she went out there to see if she
can help with it.</p>

<p>I offered to support her by going to the printer as well, but she
was all "no" because her advisor was going to be there too, and if I'm
there he'll think she's just fucking around.  Fair enough.</p>

<p>She left her cell phone and when it rang and her advisor's name
came up I answered it.  He was basically aware of the situation and
gave his suggestion on how to get it finished (dump to powerpoint and
send to Kinko's and FedEx to him at the conference with Saturday
delivery).</p>

<p>Since Sally's advisor was actually also on his way to the printer
as well, he and Sally will get to be all stressed together and fight
and do whatever they need to do.</p>

<p>I wish them the best.</p>

<p>Was going to email Josephine to tell her congratulations for going
to advisor trainer training tomorrow, but realized my email wouldn't
get to her even if I go to Kinko's (unless I use yahoo) so I just
decided to call her and tell her, instead of going to Kinko's.  So I
did.  It was great.</p>

<p>Talked to Janette and told her my interview was great, and
congratulations on her new computer, and about my future plans and
such.  I was standing outside on the balcony cause my phone doesn't
work inside very well.</p>

                        <p class=date>12:33am PST Friday 6 December 2002</p>

<p class=note>I'm so glad that I didn't go to Kinko's, otherwise I
wouldn't have had the chance to do this:</p>

<p>As I stood on the balcony, overlooking California, talking to
Janette on the phone, Sally drove up as I was talking to Janette and
was all, "Rob!  Come down!  I wanna show you something."</p>

<p>I hung up quickly with Janette because my phone went all staticky
when I stepped back inside.</p>

<p>"I have a surprise to show you," Sally gushed as I got into the
car.</p>

<p>"How is your printing project?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it was fine; by the time I got there, they figured out what I
was coming to show them.."</p>

<p>On the radio was Barbara, Sally's friend from KUCI, playing her
show BossaSuperNova, featuring "samba, bossa nova, samba-funk, jazz,
electronic" music.</p>

<p>Sally took me to her campus and then I saw the sign on the building
<b>88.9 KUCI</b>...</p>

<p><em>We're going to the <a href="https://www.kuci.org">radio station
at UCI</a>!</em></p>

<p> It's student run, has a lot of the same music as KTRU (though it
has a lot more music, most of it is not reviewed, so I would have to
change my style of DJing if I volunteered at KUCI), doesn't have as
much graffitti or stickers everywhere as KTRU, DJ's are allowed to
take calls on the air, and they have a much bigger space than KTRU.
KUCI is in a temporary trailer building thing; their front entry room
is big as all KTRU's rooms combined.</p>

<p>Met Barbara, Sally's friend who was DJing, playing some Brazillian
music, which I would classify simply as "jazz."  Met Barbara's
significant other (forgot his name) and scanned around the CDs and
such looking for familiar names.</p>

<p>I had Sally listen to a funny song by Smile on their _Girl Crushes
Boy_ album.  I don't know the name of the song; it's a "hidden" track
available at the end of the CD after like 13 minutes of silence when
the last track ends.</p>

<p>Barbara's shift ended and I was talking to the next DJ, <a
href="https://www.r3e.com">Rob Roy</a>, whose show is <b>Music, Mirth
and Madness</b>, featuring "ug hip-hop, breaks, jungle, downtempo,
breakbeats" which I describe as electronic/breakbeat show, including
some hip hop.  We started talking, hit it off around music (especially
DJs (like my boy Chadillac) who can freestyle mix shit together and
have it sound good, given they have no conscious knowledge of what
exactly is on the recordings) and computers and travel and blogs... So
when Sally left, she encouraged me to stay and hang out with Rob
Roy.</p>

<p>Took me a while to decide, but I did stay and am glad I did.</p>

<p>Rob Roy was all, "K-U-C-I [blah blah blah] and I'm Rob Roy, plus
I've got a guest DJ.."

<p>and I introduced myself</p>

<p>"and do you have a DJ name besides just Rob?"</p>

<p>"Um, how about Thunder Rabbit?"</p>

<p>My dream coming true, as Rob Roy sorta interviewed me on the radio
and asked a bit about where I'm from (KTRU | Houston | Gulf of Mexico
(and how it's different (murkier but warmer) than pacific coast)) and
let me yammer about a couple of songs that I selected.  Fun stuff.
Played a song by Panacea, and "You'll Hide" by The Controls, which did
not have breakbeats in it, but I didn't know his rule for selecting
music yet.</p>

<p>I didn't find anything like super heavy jungle beats, but I don't
know a lot of jungle artists.  ("don't know a lot of" = "know almost
zero")</p>

<p>Rob showed me his websites and had asked a bit about my computer
background and a bit about my traveling future.</p>

<p>All too soon the shift was over (2 hours only!) (I'm used to my 3
hour 7-10pm Saturday) and Rob Roy took me home to Sally's.  Most
excellent to meet him and hang out in a college radio station again!</p>
