<p class=date>9 July 1998</p>

<p>Yesterday I found out why my ConCon status was not determined.  They were waiting for a $75 check for my deposit!  Holy cow... so I sent that today and will find out hopefully soon if I make it.. A woman named Anne said there are "a few advisor positions open" or something like that.  Yipes!    

<p>So I released the outcome to the stars and will go to ConCon if they say yes, otherwise I'll go to Opus!

<p>my life has been opening up in a most lovely manner lately.  I'm so totally enjoying not having to work.

<p class=date>9 July 1998</p>

<p><br><font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font></p>

<p>I webpaged until 6:45pm and zipped off to Hermann Park (sp) and Miller Outdoor Theater where a guy stopped me to say HI.  It was Vincent who I had met at Fred Haas Toyota back in June!

<p>He seems more friendly than I'm really interested in, but I gave him my phone number at his request.

<p>Then Rhoda drove up with Zach from Thoreau Congregation and said HI and the Magwoods from Northwoods arrived and we all went to the top of the hill and were chillin' and relaxin' for our Wednesday night bring-your-own-picnic dinner on the hill.

<p>I hadn't brought any food and they inquired.  I said, "I'm embarassed to say I got home at 4pm after not having eaten and then totally chowed and now I'm not hungry."

<p>They understood and I ate a bit of Jim's fabulous cookin' and then what the hell this huge noise was all

<h1><em>RUUuuurururRRRURRURrurrur</em></h1>

<p>behind us and a truck drove up the hill and turned and water pooouured out the back and the guys parked and dropped off $48 worth of 1 cubic foot blocks of ice!!!

<p>While they were popping them out of the truck, about 20 youth with towels (good hitchhikers) walked up the hill.  
<br>Weird.

<p>They hovered around the ice and I walked up. I skipped the formalities. "HI. What are you doing?"

<p>"We're going to slide down the hill on the ice!"

<p>Soon the truck drove off and we joined their group and had a super incredible awesome fun time!!!

<p><em>zzziiiiingggggggggg</em> down the hill with cold cold butt and hold on tight and be prepared to tumble but it was funnnn!!!!
So much like the time so long ago when Gary Strouz and I had slid down that hill on our butts during a sudden rainstorm while we had been playing disc golf.

<p>Fun fun Fun past dark and everyone had to go but I stayed back and stacked up 9 blocks of ice that had not been smashed by the youth after the sliding festivities.  I wonder what people thought if/when anyone found them.

<p>I brought home the 1 piece I had been sliding on.

                        <p><title>Last check from work</title></p>

<p class=date>8 July 1998</p>

<p>After gymnastics yesterday, I was doing email and stuff when Manda called around 11pm.  At 11:30 we met at House of Pies to munch and chat.

<p>We talked about whatever and caught each other up on our current life situations.  We found that we're both busy busy with all kinds of stuff and both need help in the <b>completion of goals</b> department.  So we decided to act as cheerleaders for eachother, making sure we get our respective stuff done.

<p>We ended up talking in the parking lot till about 2am at which point we both were like, "holy shit it's 2am!" and we vacated.

<p>I woke up <em>bing</em> at 8:55am.  Whew!  I was supposed to be working at 9am in the Lodge with Roy.  I got there late, but it was okay.  We got finished in 1 day what he expected to take 2: I pasted together the phone directories for all the men in the organization. I used copy tape and made corrections and pasted together all the pages in "book order."

<p>Just because I could, I cut out and repasted my name in the directory so it was slightly out of line with the other names.  Just like 1 character offset just to emphasize it a bit.

<p>I took the final product to CopyMax so they could make 600 directories.  While there Susan Joplin called me on my cell phone and we talked for like 15 minutes while the guy behind the counter calculated the cost.

<p>After Copy Max, to Telecheck I drove to pick up my last check.

<p>I parked in the bowels of the Galleria (big shopping center across the street) and walked barefoot to through Saks Fifth Avenue, which was cool just because.

<p>(My friend John has wondered about the existence of Saks Fifth Avenue.  "Where did all those people come from?"
<br>"What do you mean?" I asked. 
<br>"I mean, they seem like they're from a different planet or something..."
<br>To some degree I have to agree.)

<p>Called Maggie to let me in on the 9th floor and said HI to everyone and described how thrillfully happy I've been and more productive and all that.  Totally amazing.

<p>I picked up my last check for 3 weeks worth of pay and vacation and stuff.  Dave told me that the afternoon I left (not serving my two weeks' notice) upper management immediately said, "no more getting paid 2 weeks severance pay if they don't work!"

<p>That included my friend Jeff Alfonso, who gave his notice the same day I did.  He had to work 2 weeks.  I give thanks to my higher Self and guides and stuff.  SmooooOOOooooch!!

<p><li>On our flight home from GA, the pilot swung by Niagra Falls, giving us a spectacular view from only 4000 feet in the air.  Truly awe inspiring.</li>

<p class=date>7 July 1998</p>

<p>Today I was driving to the Lodge to work listening to Sam Malone and the morning show on the radio.  Sam started talking about people who named their cars, and I <b>knew</b> they would talk calls on the subject.

<p>So I called from my car, Scott, and Chuck answered the phone, "KRBE"

<p>"Hey this is Rob!  I have a car named Scott!"

<p>"Scott?" he confirmed.  "Hang on," and he put me on hold.

<p>Then I heard Sam on the radio (and over the hold "music" on the phone), "oh, we're taking calls on this?"

<p><blockquote>Understand that Chuck frequently talks to Sam through Sam's headset so the audience can't hear it, except for Sam's response.
So Sam was responding essentially to <b>my</b> call!  Wheee!
</blockquote>

<p>Then <em>bing</em> Sam picked up the line, "KRBE how ya doing?"

<p>"Hey Sam!  This is Rob and I'm driving my car named Scott!  He's a 91 Toyota Camry from Sterling McCall Toyota!"

<p>(The morning show often plugs Sterling McCall) Maria responded, "way to get that plug in there!"

<p>Then I interrupted, "but better than a plug, I've got a song!"

<p>"Let's hear it!"

<pre>
"Oh Scottie, you're my favorite car.
Wherever we go, yeah, there you are!
Oh Scottie, I love you so much,
Cause you're the kinda car that has a clutch!"
</pre>

<p>Maria yelled, "that's great!"

<p>Psycho Robbie goes, "wow!"

<p>Sam goes, "give this guy some tickets!"

<p>And <em>bing</em> I was back on hold again and listening to the next call.

<p>"HI what's your name and your car's name?"

<p>"blah blah blah blah"

<p>"Do you have a song for your car?"

<p>"nope"

<p>"Oh well, hey thanks for calling"

<p>And then Chuck came back on the line. "Hey would you like 4 tickets to the IMax this Friday night?"

<p>"heck yeah!"

<p>And that's how I won tickets to the IMax for a song.
</p>

                        <h1>1998 New Orleans rally review by Sean Murray</h1>

<p><p><hr></p>

<p><p>Well it was 3 months ago but I&rsquo;ll try to remember it since obviously
nobody else did. Well. all of the OKC people met at the church at 11:00
on thursday night. It took a while to leave though because we had this
big ordeal because some people from Tulsa and Maia were supposed to come
with us and there wasn&rsquo;t enough room, but I made some calls and 15
minutes before we were supposed to leave Eryn Pope&rsquo;s mom said she&rsquo;d
drive to New Orleans. Everybody send Eryn&rsquo;s mom letters of love and
thanks. so Finally we got on the road. We made several stops (mostly
debbie and I demanding a smoke break) along the way, but at one of the
stops sombody from one of the cars hopped into my spot in the van so I
had to ride in the car with Nacy, Eryn&rsquo;s mom, Frank, and Meriad. Merriad
slept a lot and I was having an interesting conversation with Frank and
Nancy until my nose caught a very fowl oder. After  awhile I realized
the garlic/onion/dead animal/ sent was Frank. Frank, I love ya but put
some deoderant aon those bad boys. So anyways&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;
<br>Eryn&rsquo;s mom drove ahead of the van so we arived at Maia&rsquo;s house at about
2 or 3 in morning. Eryn&rsquo;s mom was tired so she took a nap and the rest
of us watched brain candy. 2 hours later I said, &ldquo;hey what&rsquo;s taking the
van so long&rdquo;. 1 hour later the van arived at Maia&rsquo;s house. The van had a
blow out so they had to pull over and change the tire. so we all loaded
into the van as Maia shoved us around and pushed everybody out of a seat
so she could have one seat to her self abd we got on the road. About 15
minutes later we pulled over again, the spare tire the rental company
had given us had dry rot so we had to get a new tire. One problem, in
was 5 in the morning, nothing was open. So we had to wait another 3
hours to get a tire. So finally after breakfast we got back on the road
to just intime to colide with Dallas morning traffic. I slept through it
bu everybody else said it took us about two hours. So we finally left
dallas at 11:00 AM. It took us 12 fucking hours to get from OKC to just
outside Dallas. We got to San Antonio faster than that. Anyways not a
whole lot happened after that. Jeanie farted a lot and Mairead made us
pull over every 15 minutes to take pictures. Well we finally arived in
New Orleans but to our dismay we all left the sweaty smelly van to meat
a far worse oder. My first response was to look at frank but he was
still in the other car so it wasn&rsquo;t him. That&rsquo;s when I identified the
smell. it was death. No other stench could be so revolting(not even
Frank), So we ped back into the van thinking that maybe just that part
of town smelled like death.</p>

<p><p>we were wrong&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>

<p><p>Where ever we went the stnch followed. But we finally arived at the
church and it didn&rsquo;t really bother me so much because I was at the
rally. well 27 hours after having left OKC we arived at the church just
in time for opening circle. During opening circle we palyed the quetion
response game wich was funny but as somebody was reading their&rsquo;s Maia
just blurted out laughing really loud so Nathan(being in charge and
everything) asked her what was so funny) and to my horror she says that
She and Emily were just talking about my dick. This was very
very&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;hmmmmm, I can&rsquo;t think of the word but it wasn&rsquo;t good.
Now let&rsquo;s get of Topic here for a second. For some reson my dick has
been the hot topic in YRUU lately. WHY??? It&rsquo;s not that great it&rsquo;s just
kinda there. I don&rsquo;t see everybody thinks it&rsquo;s so god damn funny. HOw
about everybody just stop it. Why don&rsquo;t you talk about Erick&rsquo;s hole in
his chest or Maia&rsquo;s boobs or something. Just stop talking about my Dick.
Okay, back to the rall. After opening circle we all went to our touch
groups. Well everybody in my touch group smoke so while everybody else
was playing getting to know you games we were outside smoking. Sucks to
be everybody else. The Shannon came over and said that he had to put up
some smoking boundery thing in order to eliminate social smoking. So he
up a bunch of boxes made of string that was supposed to sepperate us.
Then Debbie started rambling about isolation and oppression of the
minorities,but after awhile she forgot her point and it just turned into
30 minutes of babbling. So then there was a problem. All of the smokers
kept tripping over the strings that were supposed to keep us from
socially smoking. So we formed a ku and over threw the boxes of string
by burning them with our lighters. So New Orleans bacame a socially
smoking rally and the fun began. As for the rest of the rally, I slept a
lot. I don&rsquo;t remember a thing after 4 saturday morning to closing
circle. I vaguely remember Ashley Robinson saying something aobut me
putting my feet in her face while I was asleep(sorry). So then we all
went to french quarter and spent what little money we had left and went
home. The ride back home surprisingly was problem free other than Debbie
making frequent wrong turns.</p>

<p><p>Love you all,</p>

<h1>General Assembly</h1>

<p><br><font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font></p>

<p class=date>10:03am Saturday 27(?) June 1998</p>

<p>Yesterday I started at a workshop on how to get grants from an private grant giving organization.  They give away millions of dollars each year and I nearly snoozed through the workshop (guess who was up late?) but I got their "how to apply" packet at the end and it was all good.

<p>That was after $6.00 (including tax and tip) breakfast of yogurt and granola with Wende. I'll go to the grocery store this morning so I won't have to pay that much tomorrow.

<p>I read Contact and slept through the 3:45 workshop yesterday on sexuality in the bible.

<p>Oh, at the young adult caucus, we barely got anything done as we started late and talked too much (being good UUs), but we still had fun and it was all good.

<p>At 5pm I went to the Young Adult table and chilled while chalices sold themselves and I chatted with Justice, Jen, Matt and Joey.

<p>We decided to go out to eat, so we gathered up the troops and headed to Empire Brewery, by way of High Falls, a local tourist attraction and saw the huge pitch-back water wheel (musta been 60 feet tall) and could still clearly see part of the walls and masonry of the original building.  Then we walked out over the pedestrian bridge that offers a lovely view of the falls.

<p>We ate at Empire Brewery and at the table were Jen, Allen, Matt, Wende, Ashley, Sabrina, Jen, Amy and I.  I went to the restroom and on the way back saw some guys with yellow and red plastic beanies with chrome propellers on top!  I totally had to have 1 so I said HI and asked for one!

<p>Upon arrival back at the table some of the others were all, "where'd you get that??  I have to have one!"  As a group we ended up with 3 such beanies.

<p>I ate really thin crust pizza--Wende Matt and I shared 2 between us. I put some of Jen's left over lettuce, cream cheese and guacamole on my last slice to save for later.

<p>Then off to The Bridging Ceremony (nothing to do with the bridge overlooking High Falls) which was really powerful for me when two youth (bridging across from high school to young adult program) approached me to be their mentor person.  Ian acquiesced and accepted my beanie in compensation.  I was so moved to be so quickly chosen by Susan, who held firmly my hand while she crossed her arms and I stood carefully and felt her energy.

<p>I said, "whenever you're ready" and we soon walked forward hand in hand (without her arms crossed now) and she lit a candle and spoke her name into the microphone and gave a great hug as we separated.

<p>To the back of the room I went with the other young adults where we held hands while singfully chanting our loving support for the other bridging youth.  The whole ceremony was beautiful.

<p>The ceremony was too long for a four year old boy, so I soon ended up on the floor as a jungle gym for him.  When the ceremony was over, as he was riding around the room on my shoulders, some youth walked up to me, "Hi Jungle Jim!"

<p>I chilled and talked to Anne Marie and said HI to Susan and gave her my address and stuff in case she wanted support from me.
She said she's not ready to join the young adult group yet, but she bridged because she's soon traveling to Nepal where there is no YRUU.

<p>Then off to young adult worship I went and we did a silent guided meditation.  Silent in that no one spoke, guided in that we were walking hand in hand with eyes closed through the young adult room.  Quite an interesting experience, especially to arrive back in the circle in reverse order.

<p>Worship ended and I stayed and talked to Jen and two others for a while and we shared toe flexibilities and silly games and talked and bonded and described our GA days and it was wonderful boding time. 

<p>Soon the others left and it was just me and Jen up till 2:45 am and I sleepily lovingly listened to her stories and we found we both love roller coasters and she loves white water rafting for adrenaline (which I would love if given the chance) and I told her my recent skating accident story.  We held hands and fell asleep laying sideways facing each other on the floor til 3:30am when we woke up and went up to my room for her to saline her eyes before she drove home.  

<p>Actually she drove to the other Jen's house, where she was staying during GA.

<h1>General Assembly</h1>

<p><font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font>

<p class=date>11:30 AM Thursday 25 June 1998</p>

<p>Just went with Drake, Tera, Wende to the mall and Drake and I bought swim trunks for $10 each.  Met Jo Victoria! How cool to meet her after knowing her name from emails on YRUU-L mailing list!  Met youth Tim Wing and Stephanie something and Mandy Jacobson.

<p>Tim had rainbow colored cloth sections added to the pant legs of his pants, making what we call in Southwest District "Nancy Deardorff Pants"

<p>I walked barefoot to the mall and I'm thankful for Wende carrying my sandals.  Definitely having fun and looking forward to our bags arriving around 3pm.  My bag has my contact stuff and skates.

<p>I brought my skates!

<p>1:30am Friday 26 June 1998

<p>I connected with the young adults mostly today and hung out at their booth and helped color their sign and remet Justice Waidner (from Soutwest District) and David May and Riley McLaughlin (sp) and others.  Very few from SWD.

<p>Worship was cool.  I announced to the group that I quit my job and they clapped and a woman said she did the same thing in January.

<p>Went to the dance and got totally sweaty dancin' all crazy and remet Danita who I met at Fall Conference a few years back..  Saw Gregor Faron from Princeton and met Madeleine, who spells her name just like my aunt.  She was impressed at that.

<p>Got back to the room and wrestled with Wende and showered and am now going to bed.

<p>Good night.

                        <p><title>First days off work</title></p>

<p class=date>2:30am Wednesday 24 June 1998</p>

<p>On Monday, my first day without work, I went to Kathy Fey's, to get body work done.  She did cranio-sacral balancing this time. (she also does massage and reiki and other stuff)

<p>Back at home, I chilled and helped Robin with some computer questions and slept and read the first chapter of <em>Contact</em> by Carl Sagan.

<p>Today I got up and researched <a href=https://www.rightstep.com target="newwin">The Right Step</a>'s ISP to see how I can help them get their page looking cooler.  I met with them at 9:30 Tuesday morning and it looks like I will be soon working for them!

<p>I tried to figure out how to use MS Front Page, but I couldn't see how to make it use flash.net as my proxy server instead of remote-nugen.  I don't know what the problem is.

<p>Then I drove toward the dentist but got a flat tire on the way and while changing it found a lug nut had been cross-threaded when it was mounted last time.  I cross-threaded another lug nut trying to fix the first one and finally drove to Discount Tire Company, who fixed my flat but wouldn't mount the tire because the lug bolts were stripped.

<p>So I drove to the nearby Toyota dealership who charged $106.58 to fix the two lug bolts but said they wouldn't "help me" cover the price because it was a different Toyota dealership that cross-threaded the bolts in the first place.

<p>Fine.  So I wrote a <a
href="/cgi-local/journal.pl?date=1998/06/23#sterling_mccall1">letter</a>
to the other dealership, asking for at least 1/2 of my cost
reimbursed.  <br>(7 July 1998 I received this <a
href="/cgi-local/journal.pl?date=1998/07/03#sterling_response0">response</a>.)

<p>I got home at 4pm after having 3.5 hours wait time to read more <em>Contact</em>.

<p>I picked up my new glasses from my optometrist and Wende and I went to her apartment to munch Taco Bell.

<p>To gymnastics I went after a nap and came back and did email and stuff and that's when I wrote the above mentioned letter.

<p>Then I decided that I oughta pack for my upcoming 1 week trip to Rochester, New York (flight leaves in 6 hours).
