<p>Before the leaders came in, about 10 of us hid in the bathroom and
came out one at a time.  They all laughed though, so the joke seemed a
bit lost to me.</p>

<p>Fred and I were the last out.  We doused our faces and hair in the
sink and said "no laugh" as we went out.  Our brotherly covenant for
the moment.</p>

<p class=date>10:41am</p>

<p>We need to break up into five groups and Annie was all, "let's go
around the circle and count to five," and I'm thinking of saying "one
two three four five!"  But I just laughed and said my appropriate
number (one).</p>

<p class=date>11:53am</p>

<p>Annie on the fact that we don't play Wink in this district: "I
can't <em>believe</em> you don't play that game in this
<em>district</em>!!!  I mean I hate it, but yeah."</p>

<p class=date>12:10pm</p>

<p>While in the sanctuary (my first time to really <em>be</em> in
there), I noticed that in the back of the room the ceiling support
comes temptingly close to the pews.  I might climb it later tonight.
We'll see.</p>

<p>Hmmm.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if this is real or not; we adults are discussing
Annie's apparent reaction to people being passionate about a
controversial issue (confidentiality of what youth say in a group).</p>

<p>I don't think that she's actually upset by it.  This is her fifth
Youth Advisor Training; she's been through two years of Youth Council
and one year of Steering Committee.  I don't think this one day of
adults yammering about stuff could have really upset her.</p>

<p>Also, this "crisis situation" seems mysteriously like other fake
issues that have been manufactured at LDCs.</p>

<p class=date>7:53pm</p>

<p>I have a bit of concern that if this is manufactured, how will
everyone react when finding out?  Can it be argued that this
<em>is</em> learning?  Someone just griped that "we are here to
learn," with the implication that we are not learning now.  Hmmm.</p>

<p class=date>8:07pm</p>

<p>It's over.  Or our decision has been made that we will apologize
and then to get back on track, covenant the process we will follow,
then get back to the training.  Lisa went to go get Annie and
Matthew.</p>

<p>I can't tell if it was manufactured yet, but nothing is telling me
that it wasn't.</p>

<p class=date>8:11pm</p>

<p>What?  holy shit Lisa just said that Matt wants to talk to her a
bit more before they come back in.  That sounds like it was real.</p>

<p class=date>8:13pm</p>

<p>We're going to break for a moment.  Wait until they call us back
into session.</p>

<p class=date>8:43pm</p>

<p>Fred is totally facilitating this conversation.</p>

<p>Matt points out that our covenant does not explicitly tell us how
to listen.</p>

<p>Very interesting.</p>

<p class=date>8:53pm</p>

<p>Interesting at how angry some people got at signing the covenant
and how much people are so distraught over this whole thing.</p>

<p class=date>9:32pm</p>

<p>Well, apparently it was real.  I think the process was quite
important and valuable for the group.  I have been made aware of the
possibility that I talked over Annie.  I am thankful for this
awareness and will strive to continue such awareness.</p>

<p>Fred and I just played Sewer for the second time today.  That's the
game that Mikey Arthrell and I played at San An 2001 on the 3-D grid
shaped monkey bars on the playground.  Sewer is follow the leader on
that equipment thing without touching the ground.  Good stuff.</p>

<p>After a few minutes, we were asked to stop because we were
disrupting the class of 3rd or 4th graders who were more interested in
watching us than in watching her teach.  Not our fault that we're
exciting, but we left anyway.</p>

<p>While Steve and Melanie each had a bit of wine while discussing the
process that we experienced, I took a wonderful nap using Lisa's hip
as a pillow.</p>

<p>On the way home, Steve told us passionately about how Hillary and
Bethany transitioned to homeschooling.  Good stuff.</p>

<p>He's playing the guitar now as I synchronize my email and
journals.</p>

<p>Goodnight soon.</p>

<p>I'm in San Antonio at the CYA meeting.</p>

<p>My mom is here because she's a minister and has some time off
lately.  She's replacing our previous minister who recently had
twins.</p>

<p>I got Oreos in honor of Bryn and Elizabeth, for this will likely be
my last meeting in San An for a long time.</p>

<p class=date>3:30pm</p>

<p>We just took a 15 minute break.  I climbed the big tree between the
buildings and cried.  This will likely be the last time I see this
church in a really long time.</p>

<p>So many awesome memories here.  Jason and Sean wrassling on the
ground; that was the same year Erick woke up under the dome on the
playground.  Seeing Troy Scott (from my YRUU days) as a
magician/balloon artist making the most <em>incredible</em> shapes.</p>

<p>Just finished dinner at an asian restaurant.  One day I'll be able
to distinguish Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc nationalities.</p>

<p>Annie (who it turns out I met at Youth Council (and who I
recognized but wondered if I was getting her mixed up with Micaela in
my brain)) and Mathew are the youth advisor trainers for this
weekend.  Steve picked them up at the airport and they joined us for
dinner.</p>

<p>J N-P funded the meal of Deluxe Dinner For Four + a vegetable fried
rice + broccoli + assorted appetizers.  Yummy.</p>

<p>Annie ripped out the part of the paper placement that contained the
picture and description of The Rat, her chinese zodiac sign.</p>

<p>I collected the fortunes from fortune cookies.</p>

<p>I also piled all the remaining food (except for the plate with
those dark red crazy hot peppers) into a box for people (Fred and me)
to chow later.</p>

<p>Very thankful for free food!</p>

<p>So many fun/interesting things at the advisor training.</p>

<p>Some:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Upon opening, I introduced Lisa's nametag.  Lisa is in Florida
with her dying father instead of at the training.</p></li>
<li><p>Kathryn, upon learning about Thunder Rabbit and that I hug
trees to thank them for such patience etc, introduced me to the group,
including that I was her new favorite person.</p></li>
<li><p>Playing All My Friends and Neighbors:</p>
<ol><li><p>Signing (and speaking) "all my friends and neighbors who know
some sign"</p></li>
<li><p>Fred and I alternating words like a two headed wonder in the middle</p></li>
<li><p>Playing a couple rounds with our eyes closed and when I opened
my eyes being all "whoah!!!!" cause I was on this side of the room
while I thought I was on that side of the room</p></li></ol></li>
<li><p>At the end of the night for worship, we simply said what we
hoped to get from the weekend.  I said I hoped to deeply and widely
dispense wisdom from six years of advising.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>After this first night of training, Fred and I joked about SMTP and
HTTP packets.  I had been amazed at how quickly the comments on my
site are emailed to my computer, and Fred reminded me that by the time
my browser gets the request, the email has already been sent.  It's
just that the emailer waits a minute before it checks for new
emails.</p>

<p>I laughed a lot wondering what it would be like to have a web
browser that only checked once per minute if there were new pages to
load.  Several pages would get cached up and then the browser would
check, flash all of them on the screen in succession and only the last
page loaded would be visible.</p>

<p>Got outside and pretended to be SMTP packets, running down and up
the outdoor hallway.  People thought we were crazy for some reason!
"Don't you get it?" I laughed through teary eyes, slapping the pole
while trying in vain to explain the hilarity.  "He's an SMTP
packet!!"</p>

<p>(turns out he was pretending to be an HTTP packet, but I was hard
pressed to tell the difference)</p>

<p>Finally I've gotten to see where Steve lives.  And Hillary and
Bethany and Kathy.</p>

<p>Hillary showed us her beautiful glass pieces that she's blown.  She
has made three cups, two of them with colors, and two bowls, one of
them clear.</p>

<p>Her first cup cracked a big crack down the inside, so she affected
a cracked pattern on the whole thing and resealed it.  Amazing.</p>

<p>She described in pretty good detail how the process works.  I'm so
glad that she's found something awesome that she loves to do.</p>

<p>Bethany came home while Fred and I were laughing and chowing cold
pizza with Steve down in the kitchen.  H & B were soon bickering and
sorting things out, being just like sisters should.</p>

<p>Gotta go to bed.</p>

<p>My next task with the comments is sending the comments to myself
via email so I won't have to telnet (actually ssh) to my site to see
them.</p>

<p>I look on google and find references to Net::SMTP and uses
SendMail, but neither of these are installed on my site's server.  I
don't imagine I can install "local" versions without root access, or a
lot more unix info in my brain.</p>

<p>I wonder if I can just append the files to my mail file.  That
would be pretty rad.</p>

<p>I'm pretty tired and am going to nap for a while.</p>
