<p>Yay! for the first time I got to have a bit of a tour in
<a href="https://toshiba-mirai-kagakukan.jp/en/">Toshiba Science Museum</a> on
Christmas day.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s actually quite interesting; they&rsquo;ve got a couple of presentations
every half hour, at least one of which involves materials cooled with
liquid nitrogen for super conductive levitation around a small
circular track.</p>

<p>I hope I can get them to put Francois on the hovering block some time!</p>

<p>Spoilers ahead!!</p>

<p>Due to the Streisand Effect, I&rsquo;m watching The Interview.  It&rsquo;s got
some funny parts, and some racist parts.. but isn&rsquo;t all that thought
provoking.</p>

<p>Spoilers next!!</p>

<p>##20:09</p>

<p>Just finished the movie.  I was optimistic that they wouldn&rsquo;t kill
KJU, but they did.  The character played by
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3048983/?ref_=tt_cl_t5">Diana Bang</a> was
great+funny+hot!</p>

<p>Some of the humor was childish; some of the violence was overdone;
KJU&rsquo;s death was quite graphic.</p>

<p>I hoped they would just leave it at him crying, not going crazy, and
not being killed.  Bah.</p>

<p>I got Lin the 2014 Harrod&rsquo;s bear, &ldquo;Jasper&rdquo; (I think).  I&rsquo;ve
essentially promised her one each year, but each year I try to
convince her that she doesn&rsquo;t need another so she won&rsquo;t expect it when
she receives it.</p>

<p>This place is nice and quiet; I think there may be only one other
couple here.  We had each hot spring bath to ourselves, the entire
lobby to ourselves, the entire hall to ourselves.</p>

<p>We took a bus from Shinjuku to Kawaguchiko, and then the hotel sent a
shuttle to shuttle us to the hotel.  The driver reeked of cigarette
smoke, and the van was equally bad.  I opened the window in the van to
breathe fresh air instead.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a slight problem with using the facility as a ET Contact spot;
they apparently lock the doors at 11pm each night.  Hmmm.  There&rsquo;s
also a bright light that was on after 11pm.  (The guy said it stays on
all night, but I just went to check and it&rsquo;s off (at 3am), so maybe it
goes off at midnight)</p>

<p>Other than the doors, now that I know the light goes off, this is a
relatively good spot, though the trees allow less than 180 degree view
of the sky.</p>

<p>Hmmm, looking at the video that Mark made, I am not sure if it&rsquo;s
exactly the same spot, but it&rsquo;s pretty close.</p>

<p>##18:25 Sunday 21 December 2014 JST##</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the TLDR:</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve just left on our Shinjuku-bound bus.  Basically today was a
great day at Fuji-Q Highland, and based on very limited information, I
think Fujiyama may be the most popular ride in the park. It seemed to
have the longest line at any given time.</p>

<p>We rode big coasters eight times:</p>

<pre><code>Fujiyama * 2
Takabisha * 2
Dodonpa * 1
Eejyanaika * 3
</code></pre>

<p>Also rode several rides on time each (capitalized if I know the (romanji) name):</p>

<pre><code>Hamu Hamu Okuri  (hanging coaster for kids)
bicycles  (pedal powered bike on flat track)
Mad Mouse (mousetrap coaster)
ferris wheel
Red Tower (drop tower)
Tondemina (swinging frisbee)
</code></pre>

<h3 id="end-tldr">(end TLDR)</h3>

<p>I took notes during the day on my phone:</p>

<p>##9:35##</p>

<p>line for Fujiyama</p>

<p>##10:15##</p>

<p>got to pass about 20 people at entrance because it&rsquo;s just me and Lin.</p>

<p>Fujiyama BACK CAR!!! (7.14285714286% chance)</p>

<p>Nice air time on at least three drops!</p>

<p>##10:25##</p>

<p>line for Takabisha</p>

<p>##11:13##</p>

<p>front seats! (50% chance)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s such a lovely smooth ride!!</p>

<p>##11:22##</p>

<p>in line for Ejyanaika</p>

<p>##12:00##</p>

<p>haha I did thinking pose for the photo. It&rsquo;s not perfect, but pretty okay.</p>

<p>##12:12##</p>

<p>in line for Hamu Hamu Okoku, the ride which used to be called Birdman or something back until like 1997 I think</p>

<p>##12:29##</p>

<p>aww man the photo op isn&rsquo;t on the right</p>

<p>##12:33##</p>

<p>no line for bikes!!</p>

<p>##12:45##</p>

<p>essentially no line for 60 meter drop tower, Red Tower</p>

<p>##12:50##</p>

<p>no line for Tondemina!</p>

<p>Haha oops Lin didn&rsquo;t like it.</p>

<p>##13:03##</p>

<p>pizza now. She says good thing we ate after Tondemina instead of before!</p>

<p>##13:24##</p>

<p>in line for Mad Mouse</p>

<p>After a little diversion to see the haunted house line is too long, 70 mins (plus 500 yen to pay the <del>actors</del> <ins>ghosts</ins>)</p>

<p>##14:00##</p>

<p>in line for Ejyanaika. The line is a bit shorter this time!</p>

<p>I did the thinking face again, but it was no better than the photo we bought.</p>

<p>##14:30##</p>

<p>in line for Ejyanaika!</p>

<p>They are only running one train.</p>

<p>The first two times, we took the left entrance. This time we are waiting in the right hand entrance.</p>

<p>I plan to &ldquo;sleep&rdquo; for the photo this time.</p>

<p>##15:16##</p>

<p>sleeping photo turned out okay; Lin really seemed to like it!</p>

<p>##15:41##</p>

<p>riding in clear plexiglass car on Ferris wheel</p>

<p>##15:54##</p>

<p>in line for Dodonpa, which Lin has not yet ridden. The line doesn&rsquo;t even go down one entire ramp.</p>

<p>The first time I rode, I think the line was about two hours long.</p>

<p>##16:24##</p>

<p>in line Takabisha</p>

<p>##17:04##</p>

<p>Lin said it wasn&rsquo;t so scary this time.</p>

<p>##17:07##</p>

<p>in line for Fujiyama</p>

<p>##17:37##</p>

<p>looks like we are going to be in the front car! (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>14</sub> chance)</p>

<p>##17:53##</p>

<p>so cold!!</p>

<p>##18:03##</p>

<p>in line for crepes!!</p>

<p>I got blueberry and Lin got chocolate. Now getting postcards.</p>

<p>##18:12##</p>

<p>in line for the bus!!</p>

<h3 id="end-notes-from-phone">end notes from phone</h3>

<p>Lin prepared several bean burgers, which we ate during the day,
interspersed with snacks both from home and from the park.</p>

<p>I got soft serve ice cream from a a stall staffed by a woman who ws a
bit older than me.  I took a picture of the ice cream with Francois
and she mentioned that she had a real rabbit (as if Francois isn&rsquo;t
real!) and I asked to see the picture.  He&rsquo;s white and black with a
Charlie Chaplain mustache; she calls him ロロ, &ldquo;Roro&rdquo;, which is a
shortened form of しろ+くろ</p>

<p>I bought two packs of Mt Fuji postcards which I plan to send to people
via Fiverr.</p>

<p>All in all the weekend was lovely, successful, comfortable, fun, and delicious.</p>

<p>Actually this happened yesterday; actually I don&rsquo;t know when it
happened but I first noticed yesterday.  The local installation of AB
site isn&rsquo;t responding.  git says nothing has changed, but
&hellip; something has changed!</p>

<p>I wrote a message to Travis using (Google) Inbox.  Clicked the + icon
and his name was helpfully on the list of people to whom I could
write.  Bingo.  Nice!</p>

<p>Got a bounce: the address to which the message was composed was
Travis&rsquo; <em>old</em> address! That&rsquo;s not helpful!  Booo Inbox for suggesting
an old address I haven&rsquo;t used in years for Travis.</p>

<p>So I tried to forward to Travis (new address) the message that I had
written to Travis (old address), but I wante d to remove the &ldquo;&mdash;
Forwarded message &mdash;&rdquo; header at the top.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s an Inbox thing or iOS thing, but I couldn&rsquo;t do
it.  Not even if it was a reply.</p>

<p>That is some shitty UX there.  Is it supposed to be for &ldquo;proof of
existence&rdquo;?  &ldquo;Oh look this is labeled &lsquo;&mdash; Forwarded &hellip;&rsquo; that can&rsquo;t
have been modified!  Nor prepended with &lsquo;&mdash; Forwarded &hellip;&rsquo;!!&rdquo;</p>
