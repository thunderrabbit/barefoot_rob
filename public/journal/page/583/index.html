<p class=date>11:46pm CST Tuesday 28 November 2000</p>

<p><p>I just typed 11546 characters (including HTML markup, not including
cursor motion or error correction), transcribing 1992 journal entries
from Book II of my diary.  I&rsquo;m so silly.</p>

<p><p>Today at work I added a ton of comments to the Ritz project.  We
are just about to make it handle multiple languages.  I wanted to get
the comments caught up before we start mucking with it more.  The cool
thing is that it&rsquo;s written so well that I easily see where to add the
code to allow it to do multi languages.  Pretty slick.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m going to bed.</p>

                        <p><title>Bluchy</title>
<p class=date>1:36am CST Monday 27 November 2000</p>

<p><p>I feel like crud.  Icky poo gross sick sore throat snotty bluchy.
My snot is not green or gross; I don&rsquo;t think I have a virus therefore,
and Wende suggests that my throat is sore due to excessive drainage.
Ach bluch yuck.</p>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s been decided about the dollars.  Wende said she ultimately
couldn&rsquo;t feel good about mixing business with friendship, and
therefore chooses not to open an account with Jason.  She expressed
her decision amidst lots of supressed tears because she knew how
passionately I feel otherwise.  I want to open the account with Jason
exactly because he is my friend.</p>

<p><p>I delved into my feelings and expressed this is Wende:</p>

<p><p>I really want to make a big change in my life, something like going
back to school and -<em>!</em>greatly</em>!</em>- increasing the use of my
right hand brain creativity, intuition, art, philosophy&hellip; as opposed
to my huge focus on left hand analytical programming, coding,
computers computers computers.</p>

<p><p>I feel scared to leave my job, which is so flexible and
comfortable, in search of a higher paying job so I can afford to go to
school, which I don&rsquo;t even really know if that&rsquo;s what I want to do or
what.</p>

<p><p>I had fantasies that Jason may be able to magically grow the money
at fantastic rate so that we could <em>afford</em> to do what we want- go to
Australia in February, go to Costa Rica for our honeymoon, go to
Europe in 2003, etc etc, and allow me to go to school and to begin to
do what I am drawn to do.</p>

<p><p>Like Bruce Willis in <em>Unbreakable</em>, I explained, I feel like
I&rsquo;m not doing the right thing in my life.  But I&rsquo;m not sure what the
right thing is, and I&rsquo;m scared to go for it, whatever it is.</p>

<p><p>On Thursday evening, while talking with dad&rsquo;s friend Jennifer, when
she put my birthdate into the astrological chart thing, she mentioned
offhandedly, &ldquo;you need to get past the money thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Me, in mock defensive tone of voice, &ldquo;what money thing?  what are
you talking about?????&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>She had never previously met me; I hadn&rsquo;t told her anything about
my current situation at all.  Interesting that that comment fell out
of the chart.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>All the stuff above I dumped to Wende, and I&rsquo;ll add this while I&rsquo;m
at it:</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m sick of the investment club; I have no passion for doing all
the research necessary <em>and</em> doing all the treasurer stuff.  I have
just now gotten all the numbers in our software to match all the
numbers of the account in our brokerage, a process that has taken
months of work.  I think I would not mind doing either the treasurer
stuff or the individual research, but not both.</p>

<p><p>I want to document all the stuff I do each month so that the next
person to be treasurer won&rsquo;t be lost in the whirlpool of numbers.
There is documentation, but I just want to produce a step by step list
that is specific to our exact situation so someone can follow it
easily.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>This mirrors what I&rsquo;m thinking about work.  I have created a new
tool, a whole new genre of survey creation architecture, which should
drop the survey creation process from 2 weeks to 3 days.  If I write
one more tool, the 3 days can be dropped to 3 or 4 hours.  I want to
write that one more tool and then seriously document the shit out of
the whole thing and graduate myself away from full time at work.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>But to do what?  what?  what?  I don&rsquo;t know.</p>

                        <p><title>dream: negative sales techniques</title>
<p class=date>7:07am CST Monday 27 November 2000
<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was on UH campus as if near the Quad, but the tennis
courts were a playground and field for an elementary school.  A young
girl was walking on the school grounds and selling girl scout cookies.
Her approach was &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to buy any girl scout cookies do
you?&rdquo;  Sigh &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think so.  Please?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>And I told her no and she walked past, but then I
turned around, &ldquo;Hey, cookie girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>She came back and I sat down on the grass with her.
&ldquo;When I heard you selling the cookies, you were using all negative
words like &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t and didn&rsquo;t and don&rsquo;t&rdquo; I think you could sell more
cookies if you used positive words like &ldquo;love and great and happy!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>She sat in silence for a bit and I asked what she was
thinking.</p>

<p><p class=dream>She confided in me that her dad was an excellent
salesman in some ways, but she loathed him and didn&rsquo;t want to be like
him.  I listened attentively and then a security guard drove up from
the elementary school grounds.  He said she had to be back on school
grounds and not here on the college propery.  He indicated that the
property line ran right <em>here</em> insted of right there, so I moved over
10 feet to be on the elementary school property.  I asked him to let
the girl continue talking to me if she wanted to, and only if she
wanted to.  I overheard him say to her, &ldquo;he wants to talk to you some
more,&rdquo; and I was mad that he didn&rsquo;t giver her the choice, and I woke
up.</p>

<p class=date>11:00am CST Monday 27 November 2000</p>

<p><p>Today I sent Fred&rsquo;s unicycle to him via US Mail.  I took the large
white box (30 x 24 x 12 inches) to my local post office and asked how
much it would cost.  About $28 to have it arrive in 3 days and have
$100 worth of insurance on it.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Can I just get that many stamps?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I can sell you as many stamps as you want, but you&rsquo;ll have to put
them all on.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Great!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>She gave me eight books of ten 33 cent stamps each and some 20 cent
stamps and two 5 cent stamps and one 2 cent stamp.  Perfect.  I moved
the box to the end of the counter and started putting them on the box.
I basically put them all together in one corner of the box, and had
just enough room to write Fred&rsquo;s address and my return address on it
with a black magic marker and then I wrote a big letter to him on the
back of the box, something like this:</p>

<p><p class=note>g
<br>Happy ho ho ho and all that stuff.  This box should take a lot
less time for you to open than last year, and I&rsquo;ll give you zero
guesses as to what&rsquo;s inside.  I look forward to rolling around town on
our fly rides cause we&rsquo;re cool like that.
<br>G
<br>PS take a picture of the postage if you can.</p>

<p><p>Wende had encouraged me to take a picture of the postage if I was
able to get it all as stamps, but I forgot to bring my camera.  Oh
well.</p>

<p><p>This whole project (including waiting in line before I even got the
stamps) took about an hour.  It was worth it for my brother.</p>

<p><p>I arrived at work at 11am, just as they were finishing the hour
long weekly staff meeting.</p>

<p><p>DOH!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;There he is!&rdquo; exclaimed Karla.</p>

<p><p>She said it wasn&rsquo;t that big of a deal, but they were just worried
about me.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m still feeling bluchy, but not as bad as this morning.  I left
I-group early tonight and talked to Wende some about our Australia
trip plans.  I&rsquo;m almost not looking forward to the trip - it&rsquo;s not
like we&rsquo;re &ldquo;Going to Australia&rdquo;&hellip; but more like we&rsquo;re &ldquo;going to
Irene&rsquo;s wedding&rdquo; and trying to coordinate also how to see Bryn, but
the wedding is in Melbourne, while Bryn is in Brisbane and it&rsquo;s a $186
flight each between the cities.</p>

<p><p>Plus we&rsquo;re not getting that many days off to go.  Ack bluck.</p>

<p><p>It will all work out.  It will all work out.</p>

<p class=date>12:50am Sunday 26 November 2000</p>

<p><p>We just saw <em>Unbreakable</em>.  I left the movie not as
impressed as I wanted to be.  I recognize that it&rsquo;s not because I was
expecting <em>Sixth Sense</em>, but because I was expecting the entire
movie to be as good as the trailer!</p>

<p><p>Each scene was slow moving, but relatively short time-wise.  This
allowed a lot of scenes were packed in to make the entire film, and
still keep it from being toooo long.  I found it suspenseful and a bit
spooky with a cool surprise ending.  I give it 6 thumbs up out of 10.</p>

<p><p>Good for trivia: Near the end of the movie, when we got to see
Elijah (Samuel L Jackson) in his &ldquo;office,&rdquo; I noticed an error in a
headline tacked to his wall: &ldquo;EXPECT&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;EXCEPT&rdquo; in the
phrase &ldquo;NONE SURVIVED EXPECT ONE&rdquo; or something.</p>

<p><p>I notice this was a very inexpensive movie to produce.  Not a
single car wreck, and only 1 stunt that I noticed.  Well, okay there
was 1 car wreck, but the wreck wasn&rsquo;t shown; they may have just bought
a junk car and turned it upside down.</p>

<p class=date>8:40pm CST Saturday 25 November 2000</p>

<p><p>Okay.  I feel quite behind in my writing.  I haven&rsquo;t been keeping
notes in my Visor.</p>

<p><p>9pm-ish Thanksgiving Eve, Wende and I spent the night at Stacy and
Roddrick&rsquo;s house.  As always, they were great hosts.  Rodd made us hot
chocolate and said the funniest thing as he presented my cup, as a
warning not to burn myself: &ldquo;Dog, that is on <em>fire</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>It was funny to me.</p>

<p><p>Slept through tremendous rain (interesting that it rained pretty
heavily the last time we were there) and I rode my unicycle a tiny bit
in the morning.</p>

<p><p>10am or so Thanksgiving day, me an&rsquo; Wen followed Stacy and Rodd 1.5
hours to Wende and Stacy&rsquo;s uncle Gary and aunt Margot&rsquo;s house.  Past
all the highways to a two lane unpainted road that wound for miles
into the wooded hills.  There were a significant number of houses
nestled into the woods on either side.</p>

<p><p>Tons of fun with the family.  This is Stacy and Wende&rsquo;s mom&rsquo;s side
of the family.  I had met them all previously at the family reunion.
I played with Julie, Erica (sp) and JW (sp) as the adults watched
football or talked or cooked.  Bouncy ball and horseshoes and various
card games and limited exploration of all the <em>stuff</em> on their
property: mostly old metal things like trucks, an engine, a chain,
spring shocks, and some piles of bricks salvaged or left over from
landscaping.</p>

<p><p>That reminds me: the house is fabulous split-level with walls of
stone for the first 3 feet and lovely stone steps between the split
levels.  Up is kitchen and entrance, down is TV and bedroom I think.
Hey, where was their bedroom?  I must say I didn&rsquo;t recognize one.
Hmmm.</p>

<p><p>Wende and I sat with her dad for dinner and talked some about
Julie, who kept hollering, &ldquo;I can hear you talking about me!&rdquo; and
&ldquo;stop talking about me!&rdquo;  We mostly weren&rsquo;t talking about her, but it
was funny.</p>

<p><p>Food was fabulous and plentiful.</p>

<p><p>Stacy and Rodd didn&rsquo;t stay much past dinner.  Wende and I didn&rsquo;t
stay much past that.</p>

<p><p>7pm-ish</p>

<p><p>Hugs and handshakes and &ldquo;drive safely,&rdquo; which I did all the way to
my dad&rsquo;s house.  I tried to take a shortcut, but just ended up back on
290.  We never did look at the map to see where we had driven.  We
did get to see a possum and rabbit though!</p>

<p><p>9pm-ish</p>

<p><p>Instantly upon arrival at my dad&rsquo;s (after Sadie the tiger-striped
solid-build dog barked her brains out at me), Karen (dad&rsquo;s girlfriend)
and Marti and Jennifer (friends of my dad&rsquo;s from school) gave healing
advice for the injury thing on my chin.  Karen made a paste of golden
seal and put that on my chin.  I wore that under a band-aid all night.</p>

<p><p>Jennifer asked my birthdate and time, offering possible past life
reasons for the recurring injury.  Something about a breaching of
loyalty while I was in a leadership position of some sort.  She
imagined Roman Empire kind of stuff.  Hmmm.</p>

<p><p>Talked and played with Sadie, who was quite my friend after all
that barking.  I became the alpha dog after a particularly hard
<em>WHOP!!</em> as she yanked her head to one side and bashed her head
into my head, surprising the shit out of both of us.  She stopped
wrestling and I kept my head above her head as I hugged her to make
sure she was okay.  My dad said that I effectively made myself the
alpha dog by whispering in her ear.  Interesting.</p>

<p><p>Sleep around 11pm after reading several articles in recent issues
of Discover magazine.</p>

<p><p>- -</p>

<p><p>8am awake and Marti and Jennifer discovered they had a flat tire.
I helped my dad change it, and then he went with Marti to get the
original tire repaired.</p>

<p><p>While they were gone, I rode my (borrowed) unicycle all the way
down the one lane road on which dad&rsquo;s house lives.  After all the
rain, the end of the street was covered in water though it was
whirlpooling down into the cement tube sewer thing.  Very cool to
watch the water spiraling down.</p>

<p><p>As I watched the water, some asshole pickup truck driver sped
through the water and splashed me from behind.  I yelled a mean name
at him (I assume the driver was male), and then analyzed the
situation.  I was wearing sweatpants and my hoodie pulled over my
head.  My skin didn&rsquo;t actually get wet at all.  I was thankful for my
clothing keeping me dry.  I rode the unicycle back to my dad&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p><p>Dad and Marti returned.  &ldquo;They said, &lsquo;we pulled out a nail and
patched it, and then we found the nail that was actually causing the
leak!&lsquo;,&rdquo; relayed my dad after their adventure.</p>

<p><p>Once Marti and Jennifer were on their way, dad and I worked again
on Wende&rsquo;s computer.  We didn&rsquo;t get it fixed, but as Karen drove me
home, I believed I had the tools to make it work again.</p>

<p><p>- -</p>

<p><p>Home around 4pm and then I brought Taco Bell to Wende at work for
lunch.  Back at home I worked on her computer and formatted the hard
drive then installed Win 95, then installed the 3com driver, then
installed the 3com NIC, then let Windows discover the new hardware and
set up the driver and it worked.  Thank goodness it worked.  Visited
ati.com and got a driver for the video card so we had 1600 pixels
instead of 800.  Then visited netscape.com and downloaded Netscape
6.0.</p>

<p><p>And you know what?  During the installation of Netscape, the screen
went blank; no signal was being sent to the monitor, but the disk
drive was still accessing and installing Netscape.</p>

<p><p>I let it go for a while until the drive stopped driving, but the
screen did not come back.  Damn.  I performed a stream of Alt-F4,
Enter to close all the everythings that may or may not be open, lots
of Ctrl-C and Ctrl-X and <em>finally</em> got the screen back when it said,
&ldquo;Windows is Shutting Down&rdquo; and the computer turned off.</p>

<p><p>I rebooted and just as Windows was cranking up, the signal to the
monitor went off again.  Great.  No, not great.  Crappy.  I was
pissed.</p>

<p><p>Alt-F4 and Ctrl-Break and got it to shut down again.  I barely
considered trying to use the keyboard to blindly change the screen
resolution, but knew that would be futile since I don&rsquo;t have another
Win 95 box to use as a model.  I&rsquo;d be lost without the monitor, plus I
didn&rsquo;t know if changing the screen resolution would fix it anyway.</p>

<p><p>Formatted the drive, installed Win 95, told it to not look for the
NIC, then I installed the NIC hardware, told it to look for the NIC,
it found it, I set all the IPs, etc, and it didn&rsquo;t work.  I got an
error when trying to ping.  It seemed to not even be finding the NIC.</p>

<p><p>Formatted the drive, took out the NIC, installed Win 95, installed
the 3com driver, installed the NIC, Windows discovered it, set up the
driver and it worked.  Wende had arrived by then (11:30pm) and I was
so tired, yet determined to get it all to work.  Visited ati.com, got
the driver for the monitor, visited netscape.com and downloaded
Netscape 4.7 and it all works perfectly.  I am thankful.</p>

<p><p>I just found a bug in my journal.cgi script.  When
I view the &ldquo;journal index&rdquo; I see &ldquo;oob&rdquo; and
&ldquo;philosophy&rdquo; in the index column.  That is correct;
those are directories in that directory.  The bug
occurs when I click one of them.  Instead of
displaying files in that directory, the script acts
like I requested &ldquo;latest&rdquo; as the directory.</p>

<p><p>Hmmmm.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m thankful for this day away from work, and super
thankful that my work is all caught up at work.  I
woke up at 8am and wanted to go ride my (borrowed)
unicycle, but it&rsquo;s all cold, wet and drizzly raining
outside.  Ewww.</p>

<p><p>So I just copied some of me-and-Molly&rsquo;s ramblings
about the nature of God over to my website.  I might
use my ramblings as content to the State of My
Philosophy section of my site, which I am - * ! s l o
w l y ! * - developing.</p>

<p><p>Oh - I know something cool: I&rsquo;m in the process of
sending Fred&rsquo;s unicycle back to him.  Wende bought two
boxes whose added volume will hold Fred&rsquo;s unicycle.  I
pulled the boxes apart, and glued them together to
make 1 box twice their size.  The glue was drying when
we left, and we just need to get packing material
(starch peanuts or popcorn or sawdust) to fill it up.</p>
