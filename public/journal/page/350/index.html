<p>Despite my complaints that I'm too busy and not learning Japanese,
I'm beginning a new project of researching the origins of Silent
Football.  I'm going to slam together a page on the foot motions,
possibly scoop up variants on the game from other districts.</p>

<p>Man, where is Aki?</p>

<p class=date>11:08am</p>

<p>She didn't show up, and I didn't call her after 15 minutes, but
whatever.  I did, however, write a draft of the foot motions for
silent football and design a structure for my sf pages.</p>

<p>Work started out great with a no show, during which I rebuilt the
file folder thing for level up criteria.  Everyone was quite impressed
with its goodness.  "That's a wuk of aht," Scott assured me.  Nice.
I'm glad to do something concrete and useful.</p>

<p>Everything was fine fine fine including another no show, which
would have been a no show for Guy, but we switched so he could have a
non-man-to-man class and so I could have a man to man.  But my man to
man didn't show up.  Nice.</p>

<p>Then the second to last lesson of the evening sucked butt cause
there were 4 people in it and my brain just falls to bits, and I don't
know what to do and I hate the feeling of oh fuck I don't know what
I'm doing, blah blah blah blah.  that ranked up there with a Worst
Lesson Ever.</p>

<p>The next lesson was with two students.  Well, it was scheduled to
be with two students, but one didn't show up.  The remaining student
was really low, but really wanted to learn and I really connected with
his brain and helped him understand past tense, and by the end, he
totally got it and was totally happy and I was totally happy to have
been so helpful.   That ranked up there with the Best Lesson Ever.</p>

<p>I'm on the train now; we should leave the station in about 1
minute.</p>

<p>Good progress on Silent Football pages.  Consistent navigation on
top, and have permission to post some rule variants as written by
another group.  Also emailed about 4 other people for input on my SF
research project.</p>

<p>One of the things I love about janette is the way she views the
world.  When she had to go drive back for a forgotten something, she
viewed it as an easy opportunity to love that someone, not as a huge
chore that got in the way of her day.</p>

<p>I just chatted with janette, got to tell her about getting my
computer fixed, and hear some of her personal growth stories, and make
some plans for the future like kickin' it on a beautiful private
beach.</p>

<p>I can't overtly claim to have learned lessons today, but I have
learned some things that may or may not apply anywhere else in the
fabric of life:</p>

<p>Running down wet concrete steps, while not dangerous in itself, may
indicate that a slick tile floor below has been made more slick.</p>

<p>The pain of a headache is distinct from the pain of an overt head
trauma.</p>

<p>Though I left the apartment in a rush, my angels guided me back to
my lesson with Aki, which I had completely forgotten.  I arrived 2
minutes before the scheduled time to meet.</p>

<p class=date>late</p>

<p>I have pretty much just fucked around online all day.  This
internet in the apartment gives me an opportunity to test my
won'tpower and keep studying despite the internet.  and right now to
go to sleeep!</p>

<p>Tonight, for the first time in Japan, I played Silent Football!</p>

<p>Jen, Olivia, Steve were all up in O and J's apartment and they
invited me up cause I wanted to check my internet connection to see if
it would be wireless all the way up to their crib.  (it doesn't)</p>

<p>Jen says, "that's the best game ever"</p>

<p>So I was like, "hey you wanna play silent football?"</p>

<p>They were like yeah but during my explanation of the rules, the
girls were just giggly beyond giddy with silliness trying to rename
the zoom "Astroboy" and the fwap "boot scootin' mama" (to the right)
and "rootin' tootin' mama" (to the left).  The Schrotem also became
the scrotum (well, what do you expect??). Steve and I laughed a lot at
their nuttiness.</p>

<p>But finally, order was bestowed upon the universe and we played a
loosely structured game.</p>

<p class=message>It went down like a sack of shit. No, really it was a
complete success and everybody have a good ol' laugh. The "Squire
Penis Deb" kept us all in order. He did a good job. We all became
goodie goodie's wanting to dob our fellow "silent footballers" in.</p>

<p class=message>Rob surpised us all by getting into a beverage. And
not your average beverage, but an ALCOHOLIC beverage! He is now
officially an alcoholic- sorry. Yeah- he will be going to AA from now
on. He did well. Handled to lolly water well.</p>

<p class=message>So the night progresses down to ghetto river after O
and J's room mate appears in a towel (hmm, dont try to imagine that,
not very nice). Basically the game goes downhill from there. Olivia
complains about her headache and the rules get looser and looser. So
we ditch the game and head to a 24 hour restaurant. Rice all round and
now we are ready for bed!</p>

<p class=message>Well take it easy. Nice to talk to you.  Peace- Im
out!</p>

<p>Thanks to Oliviasan for writing the above while we munched at the
24 hour diner.</p>

<p>Laura suggested that I write everyday.  Write *anything* - a
character description, a paragraph, a sentence.  Hopefully more than a
sentence.  Maybe a really long sentence.</p>

<p>The point is I have this idea that things must be organized and if
I write a whole slew of somethings in no particular order, then I
won't be able to find the parts I wrote when I want to consolidate
everything.   An idea is to design a framework - this is a bit like
programming - to design a framework and then write the bits to fill in
the blanks, hanging each piece like an ornament crafted for a specific
spot on a tree.</p>

<p>But that assumes I know what the tree looks like, or that I can
focus long enough to create a trunk and branches, or that I keep
focused on the same type of tree during the duration of the tree and
not make some funky Dr Suess tree with big horns and little upturned
nose and carrying a net to scoop up money from a river online.</p>

<p>Silent Football has foot motions that correspond to the hand
motions.  There's the foom, the fwizap, the fwug, and the fwodem.   I
wonder how much of that I've written on my website.  Time to be
distracted from this entry to write the foot motions of Silent
Football on my site, thereby possibly finishing a project that I
started months and months ago.</p>

<p class=date>1:18am JST Thursday 10 July 2003</p>

<p>I have finished the rules to <a href="/sf/">SF</a> except for the
foot motions.  Pretty much the rules were already that finished, but I
have now gone through them and fixed typos and such.  If you see
anything that could be corrected, please tell me.</p>
