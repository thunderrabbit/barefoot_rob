<p>The first kids class yesterday included the song &ldquo;Walking Walking&rdquo;
about 20 times; I brought Johnny (the bear I bought in Thailand) and
had him join in the circle as we sang Walking Walking.  All the kids
wanted a chance to hold his hand, thought at first I tried to skip a
few kids to save time.  Not that I normally try to save time when it
comes to play, but I felt a sense that I was suppose to do something
productive during the class.  Some of the kids cried so we did a
little sit down circle and each one got to sing the song while moving
Johnny to the next kid.</p>

<p>During the second class one girl cried and went to the side of the
room while we played Hokey Pokey.  I had the entire class slowly move
from the other end of hte room to the side where she was sitting.  I
sat down beside her and she was still moe joe, but realized I was
there for <em>her</em> when I took her hand to help her stand up.  She was
all genki by the end and seemed happy.</p>

<p>A lot of the kids were all climbing on me, trying to high five me and
hang on my arms.  That part is fun and great, but trying to do a
lesson during the chaos is chaos.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you say chaos?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sorry, that was Ted walking on my computer.</p>

<p><a href="https://c9.io">Cloud 9</a> is amazing!  How can they implement
SublimeText in a browser?  I can run emacs!  It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m working in
a local shell..  So brilliant!</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a <code>.bash_aliases</code> file, <code>.bashrc</code> so I can set up
aliases and stuff.  Wow.  I&rsquo;d like the pricepoint to be a bit lower,
but dang it&rsquo;s pretty close to amazing.  If it can replace my local
computer, why not?</p>

<p><a href="/images/2014/11/Cloud 9 2014-11-26 at 12.56.16 PM.png"><img src="/images/2014/11/thumbs/Cloud 9 2014-11-26 at 12.56.16 PM.png" alt="Cloud 9 terminal" /></a></p>

<p>There are a couple of rough edges; I mentioned using emacs.  I can,
though C-b has to be pressed twice for each move-cursor-back command
(or whatever it is).  I guess some of the keystrokes are swallowed by
the something in the mix.</p>

<p>I was able to edit files in a repo, push the changes to github; wow wow wow!</p>

like visible whitespace,</p>

<p>I spent most of the day working on installing a website from git; it
has symlinks to a config directory and a vendor directory. We&rsquo;re not
just updating an existing directory, but cloning the repo from git
each time.</p>

<p>I made a little <code>install.sh</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
read -p &quot;This will install the latest version from git!!  Are you sure? (n) &quot; -n 1
if [[ ! $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]
then

fi

echo
echo installing new site....
echo

export TZ='Asia/Tokyo'

export TZ=$oldTZ

ROOT_DIR=/var/www/example.com
VERS_DIR=$ROOT_DIR/versions
DATE_DIR=$VERS_DIR/$DATE

sudo chmod 777 $VERS_DIR

git clone --depth 1 git@gitexample.org:path/to/repo.git $DATE_DIR

if [ ! -d &quot;$DATE_DIR&quot; ]; then
    echo &quot;no folder created; did git clone work?&quot;
    exit 1
fi

sudo chmod 755 $VERS_DIR

sudo rm $DATE_DIR/config/ -R
sudo ln -s $ROOT_DIR/config $DATE_DIR/config
sudo ln -s $ROOT_DIR/vendor $DATE_DIR/vendor
sudo chown www-data:www-data $DATE_DIR -R
sudo chmod 750 $DATE_DIR -R

sudo service monit stop
sudo service apache2 stop
if [ -f $ROOT_DIR/revert ]; then
    sudo rm $ROOT_DIR/revert
fi
sudo mv $ROOT_DIR/current  $ROOT_DIR/revert
sudo ln -s $DATE_DIR $ROOT_DIR/current
sudo service apache2 start
sudo service monit start

read -p &quot;Does it work??  y to keep; n to revert to previous version: (n) &quot; -n 1
if [[ $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]
then
    sudo rm $ROOT_DIR/revert
    sudo chmod 755 $VERS_DIR
    echo
    echo
    echo installed NEW VERSION of site
    echo
    echo
else
    sudo service monit stop
    sudo service apache2 stop

<p>I went to the toy shop near the Lotus dealership near Harajuku
station.  しばたさん recognized me, and I was all お待たせしました
[sorry to keep you waiting] when I came in.</p>

<p>They have a cool set of blocks to make marble tracks, including some big ones with near-baseball sized wooden balls that roll down the paths.</p>

<p>I showed her a video of marble track 2, but certainly didn&rsquo;t make her
sit through the whole thing.</p>

<p>She offered me a seat, though, when I got stuck trying to put together
a take-apart puzzle. Basically two rings bent in two directions until
they were horseshoe shaped.  It took me far too long to figure it out;
I was mm away from the solution, but hadn&rsquo;t wanted to squeeze them,
which is what was required to solve it.</p>

<p>Next time I go in, I&rsquo;ll solve the next take-apart puzzle: two giant
nails bent and interlinked.</p>

<p>Out in the field, we did meditation, then a visualization to show the
ETs where we are located.</p>

<p>We saw a few falling stars, but nothing else obvious.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m writing now because I just came back to the cabin to get the main
laser pointer.</p>

<p>##02:55 Sunday 23 November 2014 JST##</p>

<p>We just arrived back in our cabin.  Saw lots of flashes in the sky,
like the whole sky lit up just for a twentieth or 100th of a second,
about maybe 20 times over the course of nearly 5 hours we were out
there.</p>

<p>Also saw many shooting stars, though not more than I might expect in a
night.</p>

<p>We recorded audio from the evening on my phone. I&rsquo;m not sure how to
transfer it from my phone to my computer though.</p>

<p>Wake up time in 5.5 hours.</p>

<div class="dream">
Flying away from bad guys over a large hilly area, they were trying to
get me and my cat. We were in a city street and I was able to fly to
get away from them after a while.  I didn't realize I was dreaming
but I realized I could fly away so I did so.  I realized I could
control the situation a bit.  They were threatening me while inside a
room where I had been so I had to abandon that room.

<div class="dream">
Dreamed that some guys were hanging out talking about our lives and I
mentioned that my dad's dad hadn't been in his life and my dad wasn't
in my life now, and I wasn't in my kids' lives, but as I woke up I
realized actually my dad isn't in my kids' lives
</div>

<hr />

<p>and now as I type this I realize I don&rsquo;t have kids.</p>
