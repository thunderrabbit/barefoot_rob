<p>Been working on Kim's website.  Aggrevated at it now because the
shit isn't working the way I think it should.  Been fucking around
with it too long now for my own happiness; going back to Sally's to
see if she is awake yet.</p>

<p class=date>2:29am PST Monday 9 December 2002</p>

<p>She was awake.  We went to do some errands - mostly returning or
exchanging stuff she had purchased from Office Depot, Ikea, and
Robinson something.</p>

<p>Then we went to a dinner party hosted by her friend Michael.</p>

<p>Woke up this morning, cleared my bedding off the couch, got shelves
out of Sally's car; she wants to put them up today.  She's still
sleepin', though, so I'm at Kinko's working on Kim's website until I
get bored or until she emails me asking for help (which I
offered).</p>

<p>Just got back from dinner party at Michael's.  He's a cat I met
while escorting Sally around UCI some days ago.</p>

<p>Before dinner I sat near Araffin and a woman whose name I've
forgotten.  Araffin told us about a cool cop scooter thing that had
one wheel, but otherwise sounded a lot like the segueway.  That
discussion ensued after I saw a unicycle in a corner of the room.</p>

<p>The dinner was fabulous.  Two chickens cooked in wine, soy sauce,
and orange juice, with salt, pepper, and paprika maybe.  (not that I
would know what paprika tastes like, but I heard them mentioning it)
big bowl of green beans, huge bowl of mashed potatoes ("I challenge
anyone to find any skin on those potatoes," challenged Eva, who had
peeled them.  Araffin was all, "the skin is where all the nutrients
are."  "I challenge anyone to find any nutrients in those
potatoes."</p>

<p>Sitting across from me was Michael's roommate, whose name I have
forgotten.  He's getting a PhD in computer science theory.  Woah.  He
sold me on checking out the programming language Python, though I
don't really have any project that I can do with it, unless I can
write some cgi scripts with it.</p>

<p>He talked about using Lisp as a freshman weed-out course because it
does garbage collection, has no loose pointers, and is sufficiently
brain convolutionary to make a body think any language after that is
easy as cake.</p>

<p>To my right was Eva, from Ireland, to whom I never mentioned, "the
only thing I know about Ireland lately is the referrendum they had to
vote to see if they'll allow 12 other countries into the European
Union" or something like that.</p>

<p>Eva was hilarious, and quite passionate about religion and
political discussion.  And she has a cute nose, which I couldn't
really keep my eyes off of.  Her boyfriend type person Gianluca sat
across from her.  He's from Florence, Italy, and assured me that
Europeans are just as dumb as Americans each time I harshed on
American intelligence in general.</p>

<p>Sally sat to my left.  She talked to a Chinese couple about
hydrology and such.  <! we played footsies a lot ></p>

<p>After dinner, Eva's lemon custard thingies were served.  Yummy.
Then apple pie thing, and then ice cream for Michael, and he got some
for me too, half of which I fed to Sally.  Ours was coated in maple
syrup and whipped cream.</p>

<p>After dessert, Sally and I helped clean a lot of the dishes until
Eva booted me from the sink, just in time cause I was getting tired of
dishes.</p>

<p>I took a nap for a bit, and woke up when I heard Jimmy Walker vinyl
being played.  Funny cat.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>

<p>Briefly:</p>

<p>I arrived and was let into the gate, but I was late and the
non-welcoming woman behind a table was all, "it's over" and such.  I
was bummed, but just like, "hmmm."</p>

<p>Went back to Tony the security guard and told him the situation and
he was all, "aw man go back and just go in the side entrance."</p>

<p>I was a bit 'nervous' ? because, oh I know, because she had
specifically told me it was over, and I was just going back even so.
But I did go back and talked to the cat at the side door, who was all,
yeah it's almost over, but O-town is still on stage.</p>

<p>"Who's that?"</p>

<p>"I dunno.  Boy band."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Saw O-town.  Weird that we were all prompted "Five! Four! Three!
Two! ... Ladies and Gentlemen, here's O-town!!"  and we were supposed
to cheer as if they had just come out.</p>

<p>The first time through that song I danced and whatever, and then
they ended "whooo 2003 baby!" and all that.  Then nothing.  We just
stood around and kinda watched sutff until the guy with headset was
all, "oops, technical problem that is now corrected..  Okay, here we
go.  Five!  Four!  Three!  Two! ... Ladies and Gentlemen, here's
O-town!!" and we all cheered as if they had just come out.</p>

<p>A guy beside me was all, "you like this band?"</p>

<p>"Naw, I'm here for the TV cameras.  I've never heard of them
before."</p>

<p>He laughed a bit.</p>

<p>"I saw some Brazilian music last night - now *that* was music.
Totally incredible."</p>

<p>He agreed fully.</p>

<p>They did a second (third) song with the same prompt and we danced
more.</p>

<p>Then after the second song we stood around and then were prompted
to just cheer while they were onstage.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Left with Rick, Sally, Kimberly; got water on the way out, walked
through a street made up to be New York, with businesses on one side
(Rick called it a slum), and houses on the other.</p>

<p>So funny that we were suddenly in New York!  And behind the facade
on brick business side was the parking garage.  Hilarious!</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Went to dinner at an asian restaurant with all 3 of them and got to
tell a long version of the Swa'vet "Quit fuckin' around a call me"
story.  So Funnny!!</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Stopped by Kimberly's house and we all hit the restroom, and I
checked out Tori Amos article in a magazine about women rock stars.</p>

<p>Drove home to Sally's with Eminem keeping me mostly awake.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>Back at Emerson Church, we were having a ceremony for
some of the graduating seniors, including Zach Wood.  Anyone who
wanted to speak positively of him was able to do so.</p>

<p class=dream>I ended up first in line, even though I figured
advisors shouldn't go first, but be somewhere near the end, cause of
all people advisors probably know them best except for family (and in
some cases, more than family)</p>

<p class=dream>I carried a candle, which was more like a sparkler, but
only the tip was glowing and not throwing sparks everywhere, but the
tip kinda looked like a sphere as the actual wire of the sparkler
curved like the longitude lines on a globe near the top to make a
ball, and the very tip was glowing hot.</p>

<p class=dream>I walked slowly down the aisle from the back of the
church and the congregation was huge, like some thousand people
chillin' in the pews.  I was encouraged to speak quickly; there were a
lot of people behind me, including my brother, who was next in line.</p>

<p class=dream>"Um, Zach was really energetic when he was in The
Schweitzer Club back in the day.  And for that age group to be
outgoing with only a few peers is really amazing."</p>

<p class=dream>Everyone in the audience seemed to agree and I walked
back to the back of the congregation for I had just arrived and my
stuff was still back there.</p>

<p class=dream>I looked back over the front of the congregation and
could see a sign on a big building across the street from the church
like, "BIG BUSINESS BOUGHT THE BANK TO HAVE MORE POWER" and I cocked
my head over to Fred, "hey man, you see that sign?"</p>

<p class=dream>Then I heard some sort of commotion going on up front.
Someone was yelling <em>screaming</em> like a bad commercial, running
around the congregation hollering, "buy some watches, we got jewelry,
diamonds, anything you want a crazy low prices"</p>

<p class=dream>And he was so disruptive and inappropriate that I
started to run after him, slowly at first, but then building up great
speed, and he took off, still yelling his little spiel, and I barely
missed him as he did a little evasive move and ran another direction.
I reoriented myself and ran up the aisle to him and this time my
brother was also after him and the guy and Fred collided and went
sprawling onto the ground.</p>

<p class=dream>I got to him and it was the stapler guy from Office
Space flat on his back, so I pulled his glasses off to effectively
disable him, and I was all "you don't do that in a <em>church</em>,
man! You could tell we didn't want you here yelling like that and you
still did it.  And I was running <em>fast</em>; I only caught you
cause you tripped over Fred, man, what were you <em>thinking?</em></p>

<p class=dream>We carried him by grabbing his clothes, like a grabbed
his buttons up near his collar, and Fred grabbed his beltline and we
carried him up the aisle out of the church to a waiting ambulance that
had just been called.</p>

<p class=dream>I wondered about the wisdom of having moved an injured
person, but oh well, nothing to be done about that now, and hefted him
up onto the gurney in the ambulance.  A nurse helped him get situated
on the stretcher and he suddenly opened his eyes and kinda woke up
incredulously, "I'm not dead?" as if he imagined himself all bloodied
and broken from the fall.</p>

<p class=dream>I thought, "man you've never even fallen before to know
that you're just fine."</p>

<p>Then I heard a noise and woke up.</p>

heads hanging all over the place soooooo cute oh my god if I had a
camera I would *DEFINITELY* get their pic on my site.</p>

them over and over be so cute, and start barking after the third time
we went around.</p>

<p>Sally is talking with Rick to invite him to dinner and such.</p>

<p class=date>9:31pm</p>

<p>Went to a small italian-ish restaurant called Gina's and the most
beautiful cashier/hostess was there.  Alita, with beautiful smile,
beautiful eyes and long dark hair with red (?) streak.  I went inside
under guise of staying warm, but really just to flirt with her as we
waited for a table.</p>

<p>Her coworker Jennie had a bandage on her hand and showed us the 24
stitches resulting from her brother wrenching (no pun intended) a
hammer from her hand on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving.  YEOW!!</p>

<p>He was apparently going to hit someone with it, and she tried to
stop him.  I don't know if that stopped him after blood started
flying, but that's why her hand is bandaged.</p>

<p>When we got a table, I waved "bye" to Alita and Jennie (didn't know
their names at that point, though) as we moved from the counter to sit
down.</p>

<p>During the meal, I kept looking over for her, all giddy with how
beautiful she is.  Wow.</p>

<p>After we had finished eating, Alita was talking to her manager(?) a
bit and I wondered about going up to say HI, but didn't.  But when I
saw her with purse in hand and leaving I was all [insert bullet sound]
and ran out after her.</p>

<p>"Wait!" and then "HI.  You'll never see me again, but my name is
Rob and I'm on a road trip driving around the country.  You are really
beautiful.  What's your first name?"</p>

<p>She smiled, "Alita."</p>

<p>I confirmed how to spell it and got Jennie's name and we shook
hands.  Alita was all "you should come back to see us when you're back
in town!"</p>

<p>I just might.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Oh!  Our dinner part was me, Sally, Rick, and their friend Jason.
Jason just bought a new guitar candy apple red electric and has been
to Japan a couple of times for sailing, I think.  He doesn't remember
much of the language, but did learn some while he was there.</p>

<p>He seemed quite interested in my road trip, asking questions about
finances and such.</p>

<p>Jason may join the group of people with whom I intend to go sailing
tomorrow from 1-4pm.</p>

<p>I interpreted the meaning to be "drums of life."</p>

<p><em>Such</em> precision.</p>

<p><em>Amazingly</em> loud.</p>

<p><em>Incredible</em> energy.</p>

<p>I danced so thoroughly, so hugely, that I was so tired when they
finished and some other recorded music came on with a great beat.
The great beat was on the calibre of Front 242's "Headhunter," a song
that gets me dancing every time.</p>

<p>Except this time.  "Headhunter" paled compared to these beats, both
in frequency, intensity, and awesomeness.</p>

<p>Plus I was flat tired.</p>

<p>After a bit, though, more dancing to more drumming.</p>

<p>Shaking the floor with two legged jumping to the beat, so loud that
I could be heard/felt over the drums and people watched.</p>

<p>When the drums came into the middle of the room, I moved over to
where they had been performing in a little alcove thing and danced
alone in their space.</p>

<p>Two different girls smiled at me as I danced.</p>

<p>At the end, talking to Xavier (who was at The King King Club on
Tuesday) and Sydney (who is from Brazil, but enjoys living in US more
now because he feels safer.  Also has quite an apparently positive
outlook on life.)</p>

<p>Ed, a friend of Sally's, after we had walked out into the street
was all, "and you sir.. we are glad you came out, but try to show a
little more enthusiasm!</p>

<p>Got an anonymous comment that the Brazilian dance/fight style is
called Capoeira.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
