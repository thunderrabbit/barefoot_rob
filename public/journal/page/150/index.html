<p>At SS lesson, we described a picture, and practiced asking questions
based on the descriptions.  We then played a game where teams created
questions for a new picture and then took turns asking as the other
team answered (without looking at the picture).</p>

<p>That took most of the time.  Focus was on correctly using is/are
appropriately, and use of the phrase &ldquo;at least&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the remaining ten minutes, we went through &ldquo;Grade 3 Sentence
Completion 1&rdquo; worksheet from this page
<a href="https://www.englishforeveryone.org/Topics/Sentence-Completion.htm">https://www.englishforeveryone.org/Topics/Sentence-Completion.htm</a></p>

<p>Today I sent Gary <a href="https://art.robnugen.com/sv15">Summer Vacation</a>, and
I sent <a href="https://art.robnugen.com/ts">Three Straps</a> to Scout Seven.</p>

<p>I logged on to streamen (NSFW) to broadcast my feet today.  Today was
the first time I chatted with anyone on the site!  One person seemed
to really like my feet, but didn&rsquo;t send any tips.  But it was enough
to encourage me to keep trying.</p>

<pre><code>Thank you for the lesson notes!

Here is a link to the episode where I was originally interviewed
(you saw this on TV already)

https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3tm778_160222-y

Starting about 2 minutes into the video, you can see me act
unnatural on camera!!  ;-)

Saturday was fantastic!  I met them at the clock in Kawasaki
station, but they are not allowed to film on JR property, so we
went outside to film the greeting.

We walked to my house (30 minutes) and I showed them in detail
some of the different sidewalk / street surfaces, from red brick
cobblestone to decorative tiles, to asphalt of varying grades.

We bought bananas at my favorite local mom and pop fruit stand &quot;は
しもと&quot; (they use hiragana, not kanji on their sign) where the
wife spoke a bit about me.  It was funny that at the end she said
分からない、ね?  referring to me, though I had understood more
than she might think.

They watched me wash my feet at home (my ritual when I get back to
the house) and then I showed them my art and a couple of things
including where I do programming work (so you'll probably get to
see my messy desk!)

We went out to the park across the street where there were two
young girls on the swings.  They were like, &quot;are we on TV??&quot; and
hid their faces at first.  The crew filmed me climbing on the
playground equipment, and after the kids warmed up to us, we got
to play follow the leader, tag, and &quot;vending machine&quot;, which was a
new game for me!  I'll explain it in our lesson because I think it
will be too confusing to explain in text.

After a couple hours (?) in the park, we went inside to do foot
washing again, then took a break for lunch and for me to get ready
for Jack and Betty lesson!  I dressed up in suit, tie and barefoot
to walk to the lesson, and then put on shoes just before going
inside.  I wouldn't normally do that in a suit, but the director
requested it because it looked more interesting!

They interviewed Kayoko a bit before the lesson, and then filmed
me actually teaching the lesson..  (I think it went okay!)  We
ended up focusing on a couple of vocabulary words &quot;eye opening&quot;
and something else, and the -ing vs -ed ending of words which we
just did in Akihabara!

After the simultaneous filming, teaching, and delicious lunch, we
went back outside and I took my shoes off.  Then we re-filmed the
arrival at Jack and Betty School.  (more lies for the camera!!)  I
just showed + introduced the school at the sign, walked up the
stairs and put my shoes on before the lesson. We did not go back
inside again.

Walked back to my house, got quickly dressed for the beach, then
took the bus down to Kawasaki and Tokaido line to Chigasaki!  I
drew some of my art on the train and we did a quick interview
outside Chigasaki station before walking to the beach!

My dear friend Soness met us there; she brought her hula hoop and
some rice-cooker-made banana chocolate cake!  She showed me how to
hula hoop, and surprisingly enough, I was able to do it for more
than 1 second!  We sang the refrain from Ashkon's song Round Like
a Hula Hoop.

Lots of rock hopping, interviews about men's group work, and fun
fun fun before taxi back to Chigasaki station and Shonan-Shinjuku
Line to The Pink Cow in Roppongi!  Lin and some of our dear
friends were there (camera crew and I arrived late) and we had
yummy burritos and a very quick interview on camera about the
wonderful Pink Cow!

We chat chat chatted for a couple hours before Lin drove me and
camera crew to our house for the &quot;introduce my wife&quot; interview,
where we pretended it was 9:45am and they had just arrived at my
house for the first time!  Lin's mom was asleep, so we had to
modify another little interview where they asked if I have any
shoes at all.  I got them from my room as if they aren't always in
the 玄関!  (more and more lies for the camera!)

Then we said HI to our cat Jennie (not on camera), had some tea and bade them farewell after a long day of filming!

I'm happy to answer any questions on Thursday!

- Rob!

<div class="dream">
Colleen and another tall girl were playing basketball against two
young kids, easily beating them so I joined the little kids' team to
help even the game.  Colleen jumped onto my back to slow me down, but
I still while lying down on the sidelines, trying to throw the ball to
the smaller kids. Eventually I was able to get up and do slam dunks
with Colleen piggybacking me; I was pretty impressed, but I figured my
body had just gotten used to having my heavy backpack all the time and
Colleen was no heavier.

<pre><code>Gary!

We were just approved for a house loan to buy our first house!
It's 20km from the coast (20 x further than now, so safer from
tsunamis), larger than our current rental house, and half the
monthly cost!  yay!  It's all electric, so when free energy
technology is released, we'll be ready!

My train commutes will be longer, so I plan to spend more time
drawing my art https://art.robnugen.com/art

My brother Fred, my wife Lin, and I went skydiving near San Marcos
while we were visiting this past January.

I'm active in my men's group (https://www.mkp.org/) in Tokyo, and
helping it to grow to support more men, including Japanese!

And we have a cat named Jennie!

 See you

<p>Labeled both as &ldquo;Skewb&rdquo; and &ldquo;Meffert&rsquo;s Challenge&rdquo; the toy flummoxed my
ability to solve more than 2 (adjacent) faces correctly.  It only has
two slices(?) per face (whereas the Rubik&rsquo;s Cube has four by my
counting), but because they&rsquo;re at screwy angles, I haven&rsquo;t yet been
able to wrap my little brain around how to do it.</p>

<p>The price went up while I was standing there playing with the sample
model (from 2200 to 2600 yen) so if I buy it, I&rsquo;ll probably look
online instead of that toy store.  What does that imply?  That I&rsquo;d
rather save a buck than give monies to the store where I&rsquo;m friendly
with the staff?  Weird.</p>

<p>I got three tickets done at work today.  For a moment, I had a sense
that I should work more diligently.  The feeling passed quickly
enough, but it was interesting.</p>

<p>I got approval to have the camera guys film at the office, but then
the director of the camera guys said he would just film me as a
programmer at home.  Oh well.</p>
