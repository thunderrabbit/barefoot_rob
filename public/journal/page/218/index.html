<p>###There are probably errors in the Japanese notes below!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m doing a couple things with this entry</p>

<ol>
<li>testing &ldquo;all Japanese&rdquo; titles in my journal</li>
<li>acknowledging <a href="https://www.textfugu.com/season-1/hard-way/">textfugu&rsquo;s Japanese the hard way</a></li>
<li>starting learning Japanese log</li>
<li>tweaking my journal tools a bit (maybe)</li>
</ol>

<p>number 1 above will be done when I upload this.</p>

<p>Below are numbers 2 and 3:</p>

<p>Yesterday I rediscovered <a href="https://habitrpg.com/">Habit RPG</a> which
Travis first told me about, and I added 10 &ldquo;do ten pushups&rdquo; and 4
&ldquo;study Japanese 15 minutes&rdquo; in my dailies section.</p>

<p>(I did 100 pushups on the day before yesterday, did 100 yesterday, and
have done 90 so far today.)</p>

<p>Yesterday I did two 15 minute study periods using
<a href="https://www.memrise.com/course/584/jlpt-n4-vocab/">memrise JLPT 4 flashcards</a>.
Today I did an hour of those and
<a href="https://www.japanesepod101.com/2008/07/08/beginner-lesson-1-nihongo-dojo-meet-the-parents/">Meet The Parents 1</a>
on JapanesePod101, and just now (in the middle of writing the
sentence, did 20
<a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2465637515">prefecture cards</a> using
Anki.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still in English-Japanese phase of study (and I wonder if I
recommend English-English study to my students too soon).</p>

<p>Here are things I studied which I remember offhand (from having studied as much as two
hours ago)</p>

<ol>
<li>方 (かた) - thing, honorable person</li>
<li>君　(きみ) - you</li>
<li>君　(くん) - suffix for boy&rsquo;s names (I didn&rsquo;t know the kanji was same as きみ</li>
<li>御座います　(ございます) - thanks</li>
<li>代わり　(かわり) - change?</li>
<li>掛ける　(かける) - sit down; start but not finish; pour water; (and more)</li>
<li>込む　(こむ) - go in</li>
<li>空く　(すく) - become less crowded</li>
<li>栃木県　(とちぎけん) - I forgot where it&rsquo;s located, but I can nearly　read it now.</li>
<li>鳥取県　(とっとりけん) - on north coast of 本州 above 四国</li>
</ol>

<p>More more more but I am tired / don&rsquo;t remember.</p>

<p>Met Mai and Tariq to upload six (6) new apps to Apple.  They&rsquo;ve been a
while in the making, so glad to finally get them posted.  One app
binary passed the first round of tests but then came back as an
invalid binary (and no other helpful information), so I&rsquo;ll upload that
again and hope for the best.</p>

<p>Starting 14 March the Tokaido line trains which used to terminate in
Tokyo now go on to stations up to like 2 hours north of Tokyo.</p>

<p>So now it looks like we can go from Ito to Ino on a single train.
Where the heck is Ino?  Iono, but it&rsquo;s up there somewhere.</p>

<p>##13:50</p>

<p>Hilariously, while writing about the new line, I saw some shops and
such that looked like Akihabara, &ldquo;hmm! but that&rsquo;s the other direction
from the way I&rsquo;m going..&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Next station: Ueno.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aw man, I went the wrong way on the Tokaido line from Tokyo station.</p>

<p>Two years ago I decided I would make a meditation time for iOS so I
could inspire myself to meditate daily.  It took ten days (according
to git) and had all the features I needed: set the desired countdown
time, count down, then count <em>up</em> after the time had finished!</p>

<p>That way, if I was having a good meditation, I could keep going <em>and
know how long I continued</em>!!  Genius!</p>

<p>Super excited, also because it was open source, I submitted my
fantastic project to Apple.</p>

<p>It was summarily rejected as being too simple.</p>

<p>So, recently, I decided to rewrite it in Unity.  Work on that project
spans 10 hours, according to git, but I never really finished the
project, and definitely didn&rsquo;t get it working on my phone.</p>

<p>Today, I decided to do it as a static site.  With Middleman.
Fortunately, <code>middleman init</code> failed.  After that, fortunately,
<code>pelican-quickstart</code> failed as well.  I say fortunately, because,
quite obviously to me now, all that extra crap was just crap.</p>

<p>I only have a little bit of extra crap now with my new meditation timer:</p>

<p><a href="https://thunderrabbit.github.io/meisogambare/">瞑想頑張れ</a></p>

<p>Source code is available on both Bitbucket and Github (because I couldn&rsquo;t get
thunderrabbit.bitbucket.org/meisogambare to work)</p>

<p><a href="https://bitbucket.org/thunderrabbit/meisogambare">https://bitbucket.org/thunderrabbit/meisogambare</a></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/meisogambare">https://github.com/thunderrabbit/meisogambare</a></p>

<p>Weird. I see now that my description is labeled &ldquo;Status&rdquo; instead of
&ldquo;Description&rdquo;, or rolled into the About.</p>

<p>Anyway, yay!  Only 200 minutes to finish today, which included a lot
of web surfing and doing 100 pushups!</p>

notes, using a slowly dying marker..</p>

<p>So honored that M said she scanned my notes and used them in her

<p>For the md5 count thing, /u/Thespoian gave me a brilliant insite.
Whereas I had been trying to go through <em>all</em> the combinations of
uppercase/lowercase, first recursively, then with a &ldquo;brillian&rdquo;
bitshifting method, he had just been randomly selecting letters and
changing their case pseudorandomly.</p>

<p>I was going for user-friendly GUI.  My way (written in Javascript,)
was bloated, slow and often locked up Chrome.  He was going for
getrdone.  His way is quick a brilliant!  He sent me some code which I
modified below to deal with changing case in two subsections of the
string.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl

 # Functional style
use Digest::MD5 qw(md5 md5_hex md5_base64);


$search=154;

$p1 = &quot;The strident guy &quot;;
$p2 = &quot;strode&quot;;
$p3 = &quot; into the bar, and the punctual girl &quot;;
$p4 = &quot;punched&quot;;
$p5 = &quot; it!&quot;;

$len2 = length($p2);
$len4 = length($p4);

while (1){
   $count++;
   $pos =  int(rand($len2));
   if ($count %2) {
      substr ($p2, $pos, 1) = ucfirst ( substr ($p2, $pos, 1));
   } else {
      substr ($p2, $pos, 1) = lcfirst ( substr ($p2, $pos, 1));
   }

   $pos =  int(rand($len4));
   if ($count %2) {
      substr ($p4, $pos, 1) = ucfirst ( substr ($p4, $pos, 1));
   } else {
      substr ($p4, $pos, 1) = lcfirst ( substr ($p4, $pos, 1));
   }

   $try = $p1 . $p2 . $p3 . $p4 . $p5;
   $res =  md5_hex($try);

   if ($res =~ /$search$/) {
      print &quot;count: $count  $res  - $search - answer: $try\n&quot;;
      exit;
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I think I&rsquo;ll try to incorporate some aspect of this logic in my
code&hellip; but is that just going for bloat?  bah.</p>

<p>Hmmm actually I&rsquo;m not sure how I&rsquo;d explain to the script what I
wanted.</p>

<p>Right now I send it two things:</p>

<pre><code>./md5nder.pl  &quot;This string references a ADJECTIVE NOUN.&quot;  156
</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;This string references a ADJECTIVE NOUN.&rdquo; is my target template.  The
script will place consecutive adjectives and nouns into the template,
then hash the resulting strings to see if the hash ends with 156:</p>

<pre><code>3a69cefa82802a39c4e4f9c8eaac0156    -&gt;   This string references a vulgar word.
a32b170aa9dc979f3abbb6d5a7542156    -&gt;   This string references a ritzy fat.
07a47404f80c45dd18f8f8a439909156    -&gt;   This string references a macabre name.
14c294fddaff19c4ce8a67e80d6af156    -&gt;   This string references a entertaining school.
01f9ff03f0e5c1bee3d4f16059820156    -&gt;   This string references a old practice.
0fec2dd2e6fb778d608c310587230156    -&gt;   This string references a handsome sense.
eaa7d7d510fe336d741a803201f68156    -&gt;   This string references a observant service.
e74ce2db215c288aa8ff7cb452c58156    -&gt;   This string references a noiseless house.
ff77d7da707a5d95ad92f9bd746a4156    -&gt;   This string references a slim house.
205a06a3aeeecd83f93a6dfddc1ca156    -&gt;   This string references a damp page.
02302dbf19e4247ef16766806230c156    -&gt;   This string references a erratic page.
d2270e34f8729becc2d11d03887bc156    -&gt;   This string references a paltry page.
6114a4f1b1775ea76c254345f1b84156    -&gt;   This string references a goofy test.
</code></pre>

<p>Because I have a list of like 1500 adjectives and 1000 nouns or
something, it has a million combinations to check, and finds a hash
match once out of about 4000 sentences.</p>

<p>But sometimes I want to have a template without changing the words in
the text.</p>

<p>I could send an extra parameter which says changing caps is okay, or a
more complex parameter which says which caps are okay to change.</p>

<p>Maybe I could tell it which words are okay to change:</p>

<p>This</p>

<pre><code>./md5nder.pl  &quot;This string references a ADJECTIVE NOUN.&quot;  156  010001
</code></pre>

<p>could mean it&rsquo;s okay to change the case of &ldquo;string&rdquo; and whatever nouns
were used as the last word.</p>

<p>I think I should use named parameters if I go much further than this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>for each kind of nonce</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What does &ldquo;nonce&rdquo; mean in this context?  I thought it was a single-use
secret number, but it looks like you mean token.. ??</p>

<blockquote>
<p>select the method based on tokens present</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically that&rsquo;s what I did: put tokens in the string and make the
script brute force through every combination, substituting values in from
lists.</p>

<p>I slap all the token options into arrays and then each array is asked
for its &ldquo;next&rdquo; token when needed. A manager-hash keeps track of which
index each particular array is on, then loops through them because it
knows how many items are in each array.</p>

<p>I should make an interface(?) so each type can keep track of its own
&ldquo;next&rdquo;&hellip;  but even so, I think I still need an over-arching list of
how many are in each list.</p>

<p>Unless the token interfaces can spit back the number of items remaining each time.  (Can Perl return two variables at once?)</p>

<p>That reminds me..  Your version 3 script was quite simple; spin
through a counter.  But your version 2 script seemed more complex!
Loop through each upper/lower-case version of each letter?  Only way I
can think to do that is recursively.  I wonder how you did it!
(recursive or not?)  If there&rsquo;s a non-recursive way to do it, I
haven&rsquo;t thought of it yet.</p>

<p><em>&hellip;. thinking occured here &hellip;.</em></p>

<p>Oh I know a good way.</p>

<pre><code>length = length of string

looper =  (0 to 2^length) {
    look at each of looper's bits / and each of string's letters
    0: make lowercase letter
    1: make capital letter
    check hash
}
</code></pre>

<p>Hmmm if javascript can look at bits like that, I will rewrite my
recursive online cheater.  Thanks for the inspiration!</p>

<p>Before this, I hadn&rsquo;t ever had a reason to use bit-shifting
operations.  Whoohooo!!</p>

<p>I think for the command-line Perl version, I&rsquo;ll send an optional regex
of letters that may have their capitalization changed.  It that regex
is received, I &hellip; oh good grief that&rsquo;s complicated (and will spew out
soooo many matches!!!)  nevermind(?)</p>

<p>Fred: Only 2 bands so far, right?</p>

<p>Rob: Right.  Except that one you mentioned 41 years ago before you
lost your memory of previous lifetime.</p>

<p>Fred: Good thing you remembered!</p>

<p>Rob: but I forgot to write it down!</p>

<p>Fred: the internet remembers!</p>
