<p>Last night JB school called me, &ldquo;hey can you teach tonight??&rdquo; and I go
&ldquo;sure!&rdquo; even though it was raining.</p>

<p>Got dressed, including a tie, rain pants, rain jacket, and even my waterproof
hiking boots.  Took Lin&rsquo;s bicycle because its seat is waterproof.</p>

<p>Smart me: I had my phone earphones in my ears (that&rsquo;s right,
future-people, we haven&rsquo;t had them permanently attached yet! (and we
certainly haven&rsquo;t re-achieved natural telepathy!)) because JB School
called me when I was halfway there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nevermind!  sorry!  But we&rsquo;ll pay you half the lesson fee for your effort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fair enough.</p>

<p>Thanks to Soness helping me prepare, I was well enough prepared for
the kids lesson even though I felt crazy afraid before the lesson. I
believed I wasn&rsquo;t prepared; I had forgotten to bring Johnny (the
stuffed bear) who I planned to use as a teaching assistant; I didn&rsquo;t
have a way to play music in the class, and I was just a frazzled nut
before the lesson.</p>

<p>I texted Soness, and she called me back immediately for support. She
got me sorted: &ldquo;well, does the school have any stuffed animals you can
use?&rdquo; (they did) &ldquo;do they have any flashcards?&rdquo; (oh yeah I had
forgotten), and just general confidence that I&rsquo;d be fine.</p>

<hr />

<p>The lessons were a bit chaotic, but everyone survived (including me)
and only a few people cried (not including me).  The second class had
23 students, so we counted to 25 in the circle (includind me and their
full time teacher), and since they did so well, I had us count up
to 50.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure Rapid Rabbit is probably taken as a company name and website,
but I just thought of something to call my new(!) consulting
service. Basically, Soness was like, &ldquo;can you help me organize my
stuff?&rdquo; and I was like, &ldquo;maybe!&rdquo; and she was like, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay you!&rdquo; and
I go &ldquo;hmmmmmmmm!&rdquo; So I went over to her place today and scanned a
bunch of business cards which I import into some kind of CSR software
(probably monkey mail for now); I&rsquo;m going to go through a bunch of
receipts for her and I&rsquo;ll mail some papers to her accountant.  So I
guess this means I&rsquo;m just acting as a personal assistant.  Also, I
washed dishes and she made lunch (in that order, so the dishes are
dirty again).</p>

<p>And by add, I mean using MCEdit, I injected an schematic of the
<a href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/empire-state-building/">Empire State Building (unfinished) by Avalanche_Ali</a></p>

<p>I placed it in the middle of a plain at first, but then thought it
would look weirder in a forest, so I put it there instead.</p>

<p>Beautifully, without having really tried hard, the minecart track I
had built went straight into the center of the building, aligned
perfectly. Nice.</p>

<div class="dream">
Floating on a rubber aft, lofted by the wind I was disconnected from
thwe ship's mast for a while, but was able to swim through the air to
get back to it a few times.  After a bit, I seemed not able to get
back, so my friend went to ask for help, but while he was gone, I made
it back and shimmied down the mast along with the raft. The crew who
came to help saw the equipment I had and praised me saying that I did
everything correctly and wouldn't have had a problem even without
their help.
