<p>Chowed at the pastry bakery that janette scoped on our first night
in Kyoto.  Definitely less protein, more sugar, (and more dough) for
less dough than the hotel restaurant.</p>

<p>Checked out of the hotel at 10:30, walked outside, and I checked
our shinkansen tickets.</p>

<p>"We have 7 hours until we have to be somewhere.  Let's go to
Nara."</p>

<p>Awesome.   Walked without extra guidance and without errors to the
train and shooped to Kyoto station.</p>

<p>We dropped off our bags (I took all my clothes out of my backpack,
kept my backpack and computer) in a locker on the east side of Kyoto
station (locker 5068) and paid 690 each for the 40 minute train ride
to Nara.</p>

<p>(hmm; they've got grub on the train; I want some; oh yeah, I have
an extra yumyum from the bakery!)</p>

<p>This train is rather nice, with forward facing seats with
antimatamasgars (*) instead of sideways bench seats.</p>

<p>* This is what janette called the little plastic doily seat cover
things.</p>

<p>I chose not to buy a 1000 yen tile on which I could write my name,
presumably to be incorporated in the reconstruction of the shrine.  I
didn't want to cheapen immortality through a mass-marketed
hand-written whatevermadoodle.  Plus, where are these tiles going to
go?  In 500 years will they be visible for all to gawk and say, "aw in
2003 some little kid we've never heard of wrote their name on a tile,
thereby effectively graffittiing a national treasure."  Fuck that.</p>

<p>I did buy a little 8 x 10 image of the Buddha.  On the back of that
page was typed all the stuff I typed above.   I didn't know this isn't
the original Buddha.  Oh well.</p>

<p>Behind the Buddha was another line.  I couldn't see whyfor the line
was forming, but janette pointed it out: there are little kids
crawling through the hole in the pillar.</p>

<p><a

border=0 align=left></a> "<em>I</em> want to crawl through the
pillar!"  I had heard about it from Sumika and told her that I would
crawl through it when I went to see the Buddha.  I had forgotten all
about that, but the memory came back.  I squatted and watched the kids
emerge and be photographed by their respective parents and strangers.
I imagined it would be a squeeze for me to make it through.  A
slightly larger-than-a-kid young woman went through.  She needed some
help making it.  "Could I make it through?" I asked janette.</p>

<p>"No," she said plainly.  "You're wider than her hips."</p>

<p>"Hmmm."  Fair enough.  I'll report back to Sumika.</p>

<p>"You'd get stuck in front of all these people.  Now wouldn't that
be embarassing?"</p>

<p>"It would be funny if I crawled through, got stuck, then knocked
down the pillar trying to get out."</p>

<p>Hahahhaaaha</p>

<p>Got lost-ish in Nara (just started following something and then
realized oh I need to go this way instead) and therefore happened
across a performance that I'm sure was butoh.  Nice.</p>

<p>Back in Kyoto we ate pastries and watched some kids from a
badminton team play a rhythmic verbal game involving counting and
quickness with rhythm.  I've seen the game before, but this appeared
to be a more complex version with a limit of 8 instead of 4.</p>

<p>"ooh we gotta go," I checked my watch and we had to be on the
shinkansen in 35 minutes.  From where we were, it turns out we coulda
made it in 12 minutes, but I'm quite happy to be early and take
pictures of shinkansens in the station for 20 minutes.</p>

<p>I bought some yumyums for the peeps at work as this seems customary
when one of us goes on vacation.   'specially Carla; she brings us
stuff all the time.</p>

<p>After watching the Butoh, I told janette my story of how I learned
about butoh, including Alexis training me at KTRU, me getting a crush
on Alexis, bringing a printout of the longest English word in the
world to the radio station as Alexis was interviewing Philip Gayle,
going to see Philip Gayle and his friend perform improvisational
music, seeing Philip Gayle's friend and his friend perform Butoh,
hanging out with PG and friend and friend, then attending a workshop
on butoh the next day, at which I was the only participant.</p>

<p>We actually got sidetracked before I got to that point of the
story, but that's not the point of this story.  We were soon to arrive
at Five Story Pagoda, a featured temple in Nara.  janette was like,
"wow man" and stuff, which is understandable, cause it's pretty tall
and cool.  But I was like, "this isn't why we came to Nara.  C'mon
let's go."</p>

<p>We turned around and saw another big temple thing.  I don't know
what it is, but it's also not why we came to Nara.</p>

<p>Oh, a deer!</p>

<p><a
href="/images/travel/japan2003-2004/005_janette-trip/janette_trip-Images/46.jpg"><img
src="/images/travel/japan2003-2004/005_janette-trip/janette_trip-Thumbnails/46.jpg"
border=0 align=left></a> Geez louise how sidetracked can we get?  (not that it matters,
we're on a lovely leisurely vacation) I looked over then thought,
<em>hey a deer!</em> Sure enough, there was a deer.  I got a picture
of it similar to my pic with the goat in Costa Rica.  Weird.  A deer.
But that's not the reason we came to Nara.  Peace out, deer.</p>

<p class=date>3:34pm JST Sunday 5 October 2003</p>

<p>Wow.  There were a million deer in Nara!</p>

<p>Most did not have antlers; they had been sawed off to keep gougings
to a minimum, I'm sure.</p>

<p>Deer biscuits were available for 150 yen.  About 5 biscuits for
that price.</p>

<p>Turns out that first deer near the Five Story Pagoda was just a
deercoy keeping us away from all the other deer.  Literally
bajillions, and it was made all the more spectacular because I had no
idea they would be here.  I was surprised enough by the one deer, and
then when we saw three behind a guy selling something, I was triply
surprised and took a picture, etc, and then looked up... hey there are
deer all over the place!</p>

<p>They were almost completely tame: one tried to bite the sheet of
paper (map) I had, so I jerked it back from him and hit another deer
in the nose, but that deer didn't even flinch.  Woah.  Sorry, deer. Be
nice, deer!  No eating my map.</p>

<p>Got cute deer pictures; probably 100 total...  (Hey I wonder if I
could sell copies of all my pictures on CD.  Certainly a self
aggrandizing idea that anyone would *care* to see all the pictures I
have (near 2000 at the end of this jaunt), plus the slight detail that
my CD burner won't recognize blank CDs and therefore won't burn CDs,
but hey it's still an idea.)</p>

border=0 align=left></a> Okay, anyway, got cute pictures, including
some nosing my camera, like that dog in California; I wonder if I can
start a collection of pictures of animals sniffing the camera.</p>

<p>Twice I saw some deer aggression toward other deer trying to get
the crackers provided by pedestrians.  This was rare presumably due to
the wide availability of crackers.</p>

<p>Tonight, <a

Ark</a> looks like a huge low bowl striped with layers of blue lights.
It probably looks like this every night, but I'd never previously seen
nor heard of it until we just passed it on our way home on the
shinkansen. It's very near Gifu-Hashima station (next shinkansen
station from Nagoya when escaping Tokyo)</p>

<p>The statue of the Buddha Rushana in the Great Buddha Hall of the
Todaiji Temple is the largest bronze statue in the world and it was
completed in 749 A.D. In the year 743 the Emperor Shomu ordered the
construction ofa larg statue of the Buddha Rushana and work proceeded
under the direcdtioin of Kuninaka no Muraji Kimimaro.  Eight casting
over a period of three years and the work of large numbers of
craftsmen and artisans were neededbefore the statue was finally
complete.</p>

<p>The statue stands fifteen meters in height and all the scientific
knowledge available in eight-century Japan was required for its
successful completion.   It is recorded that the following amounts
of metal were used:</p>

<pre>
copper       500 tons
tin          8.5 tons
mercury      2.5 tons
gold         440 kilograms
</pre>

<p>Up until this time the gold used in the gold-plating of Buddhist
statue had come from the continental mainland, but in 749 gold was
found in northern Japan and then later in what is now Shizuoka
Prefecture.  Work on gilding the statue began in 752, the year in
which the dedicatory ceremonies were held, and it continued for about
five years.   The ceremonies were attended by the Empress Koken and
the ex-Emperor Shomu, who had retired in 749, and more than ten
thousand priests and musicians from Inida, China and Korea as well as
Japan took part.</p>

<p>In 1180 and again in 1567 the Great Buddha Hall was twice burnt
down in times of war and the present statue was recast in 1691, but it
ws not replated with gold.  The twenty-eight lotus petals on the
pedastal and their line engravings give the best impression of the
origianl appearance of the statue.</p>

<p>The Buddha Rushana, or Vairocana, is the Master Teacher of the
doctrines of the Kegon-Kyo, aor Avatamsaka Sutra.  This sutra is held
to give a truly faithful account of the moment and nature of Buddha's
Enlightenment and it is filled with a freshness and immediacy rarely
to be found in other sutras.  It depics the Universe known as the
Lotus World, so called because the lotus flower, which rises above te
mode in which the plant gorws, is used as a symbol of
Engliishtenment.  The view of the world which it presents is the at of
the doctrine of dependent origination, or in Sanskrit
pratityasamutpada, which holds that each and every constituent nad in
habitant of this world is connected to all others in relationships of
mutual dependence and complementarity.  Vairocana is the Realisation
of the truth of this doctrine.</p>

<p>In twas because he was much moved by the majestic Avatamsaka Sutra
that the Emperor Shomu decided to have a huge statue of the Buddha
Rushana constructed.  His wish and that of the those who built the
statue and have guarded it over the ages is that throught the grace of
the Buddha Rushana all living creatures may attain a state of
enlightenment in which they are bathed in the light of
understanding.</p>

<p>janette saw that I took a photograph of a cute blonde while we were
in Kyoto and now we are breaking up.</p>

<p>What a dumb photograph.  Can't even fucking see the girl in it
except that she's blonde.  What a dumb idea to take her photo.
Fuck.</p>

<p>We talked about it, and it seems that I don't want to have a
girlfriend because I want to do everything alone.  I love having
breakfast lovingly made for me, but I want to learn how to do it
myself.  I want to rely on <em>no one</em> but myself.  Is this
lunacy?  Must we always rely on others?  What about people living off
the land?  Must *I* always rely on others?</p>

<p>I want the world to take care of me.  The world to make me
breakfast.  I want to have done amazing things in the world.  I want
the world to be amazed.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I have offered janette my continued friendship, and a place to stay
while she is in Japan.</p>

<p>Haha just talked to some Japanese with a couple Japanese words and
they were all impressed.  We were scopin' the map and a woman came up
to us, "may I help you?"  (note to Japanese: this is a very good thing
to do) and we asked her about some of the temples; on our map there is
a picture of a monkey, and I want to know if there are really monkeys
there or if it's just to make the map cute or what.  She didn't say
"yes there are monkeys ," but avoided the question by saying what
there *was* in the area, name of temple, etc, which might mean there
are no monkeys there; I dunno.  But then a guy came up on a bicycle
and started talking to her in Japanese and she translated for him and
then he spoke in English "go straight 15 minutes" and then he put out
his left hand to say turn left, but couldn't think of the word left so
I said hidari, the Japanese word for left and they freaked, like
"whoah you know Japanese, dude!" and I was like, "choto choto
Japanese," but it was good anyway.</p>

<p>The level of Japanese conversation I want is to get around on the
streets, asking people questions about where to eat and where to sleep
and where to see a good movie about vampires (oops there's some higher
level vocab) that kinda thing. Getting closer to that goal.</p>

<p>Right now I'm standing in the streets of Kyoto waiting for janette
while she browses throught a fabric shop.  She must really like it;
she's been in there a while.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Heehee.  janette likes this shop.  She came out mentally wringing
her hands over what do do: "This fabric is perfect, but it's real
expensive. " She wanted to know if the fabric is silk and if it's old,
and something else, and I was like, "here" and gave her my translator.
Just type "silk" and show them the translation. Then type "old" and
show them the translation (Rob's Technique of Living in Japan).  She
wanted to know how to say those words.  And know if they take credit
cards. I was like, "go ask if they take credit cards now," wondering
if that would get her over the hump of asking about the things she
reallly cared about.  It did.</p>

<p>Few minutes later she came out, "yes they're silk.  Yes they're
old.  Yes they take credit cards.  Come buy some."</p>

<p>Nice.</p>

<p>"Do you mind waiting?"</p>

<p>Nope.</p>

<p>Went to a river.  Saw no monkeys.  Ate vanilla and green tea softo
cream.  Did see three guys in truncated kayaks.  Saw some babies tears
moss.  Surprise/spider lillies.  Saw a giant tent that turned out to
be white sheeting hiding a well tower.   Ate om rice at a little
out-of-the-crowd cafe.</p>

<p>The train going back was cheaper, faster and less crowded than the
bus going there.</p>
