<p class=date>8:54am CDT Wednesday 20 September 2000</p>

<p><p>Last night I was up till almost midnight after being up since 3 so
I was easily able to sleep.</p>

<p><p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was with Youth Council youth and who voted me in to
Steering Committee.  I asked Geoff Man of Wood how much time Steering
Committee really required.</p>

<p><p>There was a lot more to the dream, but that was my 4am dream and I
was too tired to get up to write it.</p>

<p><p>This morning I was in the middle of a dream when the phone rang
once for Wende, then (*) work called and was all &ldquo;one of the
webservers is down and not coming back up.&rdquo;  (the machine got booted,
the web broker is not staying up when it&rsquo;s activated) And
coincidentally, today is Kevin&rsquo;s first of 3 days out of town.</p>

<p><p>So I rolled out of bed, rolled into clothes (no shower - that&rsquo;ll
show &lsquo;em) and was writing this when the phone rang again (at the *
above) and it was my dad asking how much is market value for animated
.gif design.  I said $75 to $150.  But now that I&rsquo;m thinking about it,
he should subcontract that out and not try to learn while &lsquo;on the
clock.&rsquo;  Much happier for the client that way.</p>

<p class=date>7:35pm CDT Wednesday 20 September 2000</p>

<p><p>Work went pretty well today.  Kevin wasn&rsquo;t there so I more quickly
took ownership of handling some email problems/questions that we got.
Karla was super thrilled when she came in at 11am (after a morning
meeting) to find that everything was running smoothly and happily.</p>

<p><p>I worked on upgrading the firmware of a couple of our routers (huh
huh, you said &ldquo;firm&rdquo;), but I was unable to telnet to one of them.  I
called Savvis, our ISP, but their 24-hour help center was no help.  I
called Aslan, a Customer Liaison, and she immediately got Aaron on the
line who was immediately able to solve the problem.  I greatly
appreciated her awesome customer service.  I sent her boss and Aaron&rsquo;s
boss each an email praising their great efforts.</p>

<p><p>After work Wende and I met at Taco Bell for some food items.</p>

<p><p>She&rsquo;s at her women&rsquo;s group now, and I just finished shredding a
small pile of papers that has been in the &ldquo;Shred&rdquo; pile for a while.  I
really like our new shredder!</p>

<p class=date>3:07am CDT Tuesday 19 September 2000</p>

<p><p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>With YRUUers, continental level..  A DJ was playing a
song for us and we were slowly floating over extremely shallow water in
this boat.  I was in the front of the boat and could see how we were
being carefully steered through the shallow water just where it was
deep enough to float through.  Water faded into a large open area city
type landscape, and the &ldquo;just deep enough&rdquo; of the water turned into a
slight trail worn through the grass.  I was still in front and walking
following the path while our &lsquo;leader&rsquo; was behind me. I was able to
lead even though I didn&rsquo;t know &ldquo;where&rdquo; we were going.  It was like a
social action type thing.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was following the path in the grass along chain link
fences, over small creeks and into a large covered concrete pavilion
with smooth concrete.  I no longer simply walked, but was doing a
hippity tippity tap dance walk on the concrete, which made a nice
rhythmic clicky sound.</p>

<p><p>emacs rules.  I have set up my .emacs file so I can load emacs and
in a new buffer type C-cj (That&rsquo;s CONTROL-c then press j) and it will
write all this, filling in the exact date and time:</p>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s the perfect template for a dream journal entry! If I want it
to be just a normal entry, 5 quick C-k&rsquo;s will erase the lines
referring to a dream entry.  So sweet and I just love it!</p>

<p class=date>6:28am CDT Tuesday 19 September 2000</p>

<p><p>I called Psycho Robbie and I asked him for tickets.  He said he
didn&rsquo;t have them, but he asked me to ask him on the air.  So he put me
on hold for a few minutes then answered my line with us on the air.
We had some quick silly banter for a bit and then I asked him for
tickets and he said he didn&rsquo;t have them, but he used it as a segueway
to tell listeners what tickets they do have.</p>

<p><p>I called back at 5:40am and Goon Jr said that Sam did not have
tickets nor backstage passes.  He wasn&rsquo;t as friendly.  So I wrote an
email to Sam.  Told him that I want to get Wende the passes and
present rings to her and all that.  I doubt I&rsquo;ll hear back, but if I
do; I&rsquo;ll post it here.</p>

<p><p>SEE ya!</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>Oh, Wende is sick today; she just called in to work.  I was laying
on the bed with her a bit, but I&rsquo;m just too wired to sleep.  I&rsquo;ve been
up since 2:30 I think.  Whenever it was that I wrote that dream entry.</p>

<p><p>Wende and I have decided to get a UPS for my computer.  I went to
apcc.com and found one that I want for $299.  I visited the apcc.com auction
and found it refurbished for $95.  I sent Wende the link down below, and she
sent me the reply not so far below.  This message is so cute because Wende
wrote (cough, cough) on it.  She&rsquo;s been sick at home all day today.  My poor
sweet angel.</p>

<p class=date>11:31pm CDT Tuesday 19 September 2000</p>

<p><p><h1>shredder</h1></p>

<p><p>After work I went to Office Max to price shredders.  Wende had
purchased a shredder for $19 from Target.  This shredder shredded into
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; strips of paper.  Wende wondered if she would be happier with a
crosscut shredder.  I believe yes, if she is questioning her purchase.</p>

<p><p>I found a cool crosscut shredder for $59 minus a $10 instant rebate
to be taken at the register.  I figured, &ldquo;<shrug> $49 is pretty close
to $19; I&rsquo;ll just get this shredder.&rdquo;  I considered taking the tag
that indicated the sale price in case the cashier had any doubts.  I
chose not to bring it up;</p>

<p><p>Turns out that the $10 off thing was an old sale, but I walked back
to the shredder area and showed her the indicated price.  She let me
have the $10 off.  Yay!</p>

<p><p>On my way out of the store, I saw Carlos, who lives in the
apartment below my ex-apartment.  I couldn&rsquo;t remember his name, but we
talked and he asked if I had a VGA monitor that he could have.  In
fact I do have an old monitor, and I offered it to him for $20.  Turns
out that it&rsquo;s CGA!  Why am I holding on to this old ass monitor?
Well, because the switch is not a monitor switch, but a pull-chain
light switch that I installed on the monitor.  It works and I love it.
Maybe I&rsquo;ll install a light switch on this monitor so I can get rid of
the old one.</p>

<p><p><h1>movie</h1></p>

<p><p>Wende and I ate soup and crackers and watched <em>My Best Friend&rsquo;s
Wedding</em>.  I totally loved Kimmi (sp) played by Cameron Diaz.  We
were entertained to see older brother from &ldquo;Malcom In The Middle&rdquo; on
FOX Sunday nights.</p>

<p><p>Near the end of the movie, when Julia Roberts&rsquo; character had just
lied by omission about everything possible, I was quite
anti-impressed with the movie.  They turned it all around though and I
enjoyed the ending.  There&rsquo;s just something about Cameron.</p>

<p><p><h1>WHASSSAAAAAAAaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaPPP</h1></p>

<p><p>Dude called and I answered like the beer commercial.  I hated those
commercials when Dude first told me about them.  But now I think it&rsquo;s
pretty funny, if a bit old now.  (For the record, I wish to say that
Marcel and I used to say &ldquo;WHAAASSSSUUUUUUUUUP!!!!!!&rdquo; during college
way back in 1993 and 1994).  He invited me to Mission Burrito so I
went to his house and rode in his new Toyota Tundra to MB.</p>

<p><p><h1>burrito</h1></p>

<p><p>Dude got a grilled shrimp burrito.  I had water and some of his
chocolate chip cookie.  We talked computer shit; I explained to him
about SAS and work.  He described his latest projects.  He is greatly
considering going freelance web design again.  After working for a
year or so for T1.com and now idea.com, he&rsquo;s got a pretty good basic
concept of what it takes to make a website.  A huge leap better than
what he and I did with MR Laboratories.</p>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s 23:52 now.  I&rsquo;m going to bed.</p>

<p><p>The building alarm blared <em>again</em>, this time after I went to
sleep.  I timed it.  It rang from 12:38 to 12:47am.  Wende slept
through it.</p>

<p><p>Weird that there is no simple system in place by which the people
who are affected can be compensated by the noise pollution.  I think
the neighborhood would essentially have to sue the building owners,
and they would blame the alarm company, and the court battle would
rage far longer than 9 minutes.</p>

<p><p>Yesterday Wende asked me if I would be willing to attend Lyle
Lovett concert with her this Friday.  I was all, &ldquo;eeerg.. um&hellip;
umm&hellip;  Lyle Lovett?  Ewwww..&rdquo;  but I said I would probably do it for
her.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Would I have to wear jeans?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Nope; you could wear shorts and t-shirt!  It&rsquo;s at the Woodlands
where we saw Tori Amos.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Okay; I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll enjoy the show.  Yikes!</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>I dreamt that I read someone&rsquo;s prediction about how the
US Government would soon be overrun by a dictatorship, and they would
be take by coup, for a quick succession of 8 different dictatorships.</p>

<p><p class=dream>The final dictatorship was predicted to be the
<em>good</em> dictatorship; the one everybody would enjoy and it would
reign for the remainder of eternity.</p>
