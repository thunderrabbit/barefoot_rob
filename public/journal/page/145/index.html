<p>Haha so Lin was painting her desk today and Jennie jumped onto it!
Jennie was like, &ldquo;oh sticky!!&rdquo; and ran away, leaving white cat prints
on the hardwood floors.  Hilarious!</p>

<p>Lin cleaned the feet, the prints, and now we have fun little matte
spots on the otherwise glossy hardwood floor.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Lin didn&rsquo;t try to wash the oil based paint of the brushes
with water.  We&rsquo;ll just buy new brushes given we have no turpentine at
the moment.</p>

<p>Today I had a good lesson this morning; the students really seemed
keen, even taking pictures of the notes and recording my voice to use
for shadowing later.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m at my computer job (have been here for a bit) and just
finishing up some instructions for how to set up a web server on AWS
with DB on private subnet of VPC. Fun stuff even if I only understand
half of it!</p>

<p>About to go to men&rsquo;s group.</p>

<p>Yesterday I made a hanger for Alex, whose plastic hanger broke.  I
broke in to my old <del>macare</del> (that aint right, but that&rsquo;s the word
that came to mind and I had to look this one up:) <em>macrame</em> weaving
skills and went to work with 4 sets of earphones that Lin and I got
from our flights to the US in January.  Boom!  I knew they would come
in handy!</p>

<p>We moved all our stuff in on 3 June, and now it&rsquo;s 11 June.  Lin is
<em>almost</em> done unpacking.  I&rsquo;ve gotten a good start unpacking.</p>

<p>I just affixed an extension cord+splitter to my bedside table.  I&rsquo;m
waiting for Lin to finish her shower so I can fill in the price and
the shelf name.  I think it was Hermes.</p>

<p>We walked to a home center and bought some strong &ldquo;scissors&rdquo; for
cutting plants, plus a broom, which I carried in my back pocket,
sticking up out of my shirt.</p>

<p>We walked while workers from the auto shop put a new navigation system
into Lin&rsquo;s new minivan.  They said the old system was too old to be
updated with maps less than 5 years old.  Smells like forced upgrades
to me.</p>

<p>Though it&rsquo;s been 5 weeks since the show aired on 2 May, the guy
recognized me from the TV show, and we talked a bit. He apparently
used to run around barefoot as a kid.</p>

<p>Showertime now.</p>

<p>urbit is virtual land.  I&rsquo;ve just become the owner of a planet.  In
the universe, there are galaxies, in which there are stars, in which
there are planets in which there are moons.  There are also comets,
which don&rsquo;t have to be associated with anything, and will apparently
be considered bots because they cost nothing to create.</p>

<p>Anyway, someone in chat using the comet name
pildex-pondex-wiswyc-bosnev&ndash;botber-ronpet-tobhet-pagwyt helped the
conversation and I said (jokingly) &ldquo;why should we believe you?  You&rsquo;re
a comet hahahaah&rdquo; and as soon as I pressed enter, before the chat had
even registered as having been sent, I thought &ldquo;oh god&rdquo; and wanted to
take it back.</p>

<p>I set pildex-pondex-wiswyc-bosnev&ndash;botber-ronpet-tobhet-pagwyt&rsquo;s nick
to &ldquo;thegreatest&rdquo; but haven&rsquo;t seen him/her back to properly apologize.</p>

<p>sigh.</p>

<h2 id="update">update</h2>

<p>I talked to him later and the joke was on me; he was using a moon
while his planet was in the shop.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s actually more like packing, dismantling, finding cat pee, tossing.  I&rsquo;ve got a list on <a href="https://workflowy.com/">https://workflowy.com/</a> to help me keep my brain free.  Jennie probably knows something is up, but does she suspect her whole life will magically transform into a new wonderland of places to pee?</p>

<p>How much of this shit should I throw away?</p>

<p>Should I go through and toss everything I haven&rsquo;t used in a year?  Will I realllly build a new marble track with stop action animation?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m tossing a printer and some of the foam tiles that have carpeted the computer room.  I won&rsquo;t need as many to fill my room in the new house.  (;n;)</p>

<p>Gotta go to Fukuura to teach and then come back tonight and finish doing the day before the last day stuff.</p>

<p>Today Lin drove us to our new house where we met the real estate guy
and got the keys!  I&rsquo;m not feeling as excited as I did when we saw it.
I guess this feeling has been described as &ldquo;buyer&rsquo;s remorse&rdquo; or maybe
even &ldquo;cold feet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We set off some bug killers in the house and headed to イケア to get
furniture and stuff.  Lin wanted to get a big TV stand and shelves to
put downstairs where we won&rsquo;t have a TV, but I encouraged us to move
in and settle a bit before buying it.</p>

<p>I wish I could have done the same for the car she purchased because
now she&rsquo;s like &ldquo;hmmm I wonder where we&rsquo;ll put the bicycles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yeah.  This situation has been described as &ldquo;stuff owning us&rdquo; instead
of &ldquo;we own stuff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Headed home now (Hamacho in Kawasaki) by way of her aunt&rsquo;s place to
return their car. (We haven&rsquo;t taken posession of the new car yet; I
wonder if we could cancel the purchase????)</p>

<hr />

<p>While at the home shopping megapolis, I dropped Lin&rsquo;s tape measure,
and it&rsquo;s already-cracked case shattered, spewing the spring&rsquo;s energy
and all the coiled metal tape.  I hated to waste it, but I rolled up
the tape, tightening the spring, and gave it to a Megapolis employee
to deal with.  He apparently understood the potential energy bound up,
and hopefully dealt with it safely.</p>

<p>Lin left her tape measure (that we bought for her a few years ago) at
an apartment complex, and the management claims they discarded it.  I
find that hard to believe given how often things are returned in
Japan, plus how nice of a tape measure it was, plus it was in a place
where they regularly need to use tape measures.</p>

<p>Bah.</p>
