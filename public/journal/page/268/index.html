<p><strong>1. How do you know you&rsquo;re a Unitarian Universalist?</strong></p>

<p>Raised UU, but I more often say I was &ldquo;raised UU&rdquo; than I say I am currently UU.</p>

<p><strong>2. How do you define Unitarian Universalism?</strong></p>

<p>encouraging others to find their own spiritual path, and speaking out against social injustice.</p>

<p><strong>3. When do you feel most Unitarian Universalist?</strong></p>

<p>age 5 to 20-something</p>

<p><strong>4. If you could design your ideal UU religious community what would congregational life look like? Who&rsquo;s there? What do they do after worship? What does worship look like? When does the congregation meet? Where does the congregation meet? Think even bigger than my questions!</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve filled out everything on the survey and am coming back to this question, with my answer to the bigger question.</p>

<p>I grew up as a UU. I remember being a kid lighting candles at the altar and all that. I became a teenager in 1983, just as LRY had been reborn in YRUU. I went to between 3 and 7 Rallies in Southwest District every year, and there were between 15 and 50 kids at each event. (Rallies are called Cons in other districts.)</p>

<p>I attended rallies until my first year of university; rallies didn&rsquo;t <em>literally</em> save my life, but they saved my sanity; I generally disliked the normal high school experience, except for rallies; they were my safe place to open up. They gave me real spiritual growth.</p>

<p>I have attended several (two hundred?) Sunday UU sermons in my life, but never really really really really liked them. It&rsquo;s just a bunch of intellectual blah blah through which I have gained very little spiritual content / support.</p>

<p>When I graduated from university, I remembered I hadn&rsquo;t been to church in 7 years. I went back and quickly gravitated to being a YRUU advisor; I wanted to give back to the organization that had given so much to me.</p>

<p>For about 5 or 6 years I was advising at church every Sunday locally and advising at every rally within the district; I was on youth council for a year; my number one focus was YRUU. I helped the youth organize Houston Rally about 4 times from 1998 to 2002 I think.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>YRUU is the closest experience I&rsquo;ve had to what I believe is spiritual truth: we are all one. Worship services where we each light a candle, say a few words, and then just BE together. Just sit. Just relax in a puppy pile. You are safe. You are loved. The entire universe is this moment right now. Need to cry? Just cry; we are here for you. Need to shout? Let&rsquo;s all shout; we are here together.</p>

<p>In my humble opinion, the &ldquo;adult&rdquo; sermons are better for those who did not grow up UU. I&rsquo;ve seen many adult escapees from other religions say &ldquo;ah yes; this is more like it,&rdquo; when they come to a UU service. As opposed to where they were raised, the messages at UU services are like, You won&rsquo;t go to hell for breaking the rules; the love is all around you; don&rsquo;t worry be happy.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s great! Those are great messages, but they&rsquo;re only partway to the reality that YRUUers experience at YRUU events. (Note, I say &ldquo;experience&rdquo; at YRUU events, not just &ldquo;discuss&rdquo; or consider in a sermon.)</p>

<p>In a YRUU event, the message isn&rsquo;t just &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t go to hell for breaking the rules&rdquo; but the experience is &ldquo;here we are in heaven already, creating this moment together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The message is not &ldquo;love is all around you,&rdquo; but an experience of &ldquo;you are loved; you ARE love; we are loved; we love and respect ourselves and each other&rdquo;</p>

<p>The message is not &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry; be happy,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s an experience of omg I&rsquo;m so happy I forgot to be worried!</p>

<p>When crappy stuff happens in YRUU, the community is quick to respond with love, &ldquo;yo, that wasn&rsquo;t cool, but we love you; <em>you</em> are cool and don&rsquo;t have to do that to get attention.&rdquo;</p>

<hr />

<p>Rallies had grown to minimum 50 kids at an event to upwards of 200 at a single weekend event when I was an advisor. Unfortunately, around the same time I moved to Japan, there were some JNP-powered campaigns to castrate Southwest District YRUU of its power. These campaigns have largely worked; all the good advisors were pushed out (according to my former-YRUU sources) and YRUU events in Southwest District have been severely limited in quantity and quality.</p>

<p>SO, I don&rsquo;t know if any of what I wrote (YRUU is great) still applies, but I sorta feel like I graduated from UUism via YRUU; adult sermons can&rsquo;t really give me any more than I&rsquo;ve already got.</p>

<p>It ain&rsquo;t UUism&rsquo;s fault; people who weren&rsquo;t raised UU may not be ready for spontaneous puppy piles.</p>

<p><strong>5. Describe Unitarian Universalist congregations in three words:</strong></p>

<p>chatty, happy, encouraging</p>

<p><strong>6. Regarding that congregation thing&hellip; which is true for you?</strong></p>

<p>I used to go, but I don&rsquo;t now.</p>

<p><strong>7. If you have the option of attending a congregation and you do not attend, what keeps you away?</strong></p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t looked to see if there&rsquo;s one here, but see question 4</p>

<p><strong>8. What do you wish UUs in congregations knew/understood about you?</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;d rather spend 15 minutes in a real hug than talk or listen</p>

<p><strong>9. What is your vocation/job? </strong></p>

<p>database programmer and web developer</p>

<p><strong>10. What are your identities?</strong></p>

<p>**Racial/Ethnic: **caucasian
**Education: **bachelor (of science in computer science)
**Gender: **male
**Sexual Orientation: **hetero
<strong>Other I haven&rsquo;t asked: </strong>barefoot since May 2012  (and barefoot for 8 years before I left Texas in 2003)</p>

<p><strong>11. year you were born:</strong></p>

<p>1970</p>

<p><strong>12. The 5 digit zip code of the place you currently call home:</strong></p>

<p>Tokyo, Japan</p>

<p>Being married has its perks.  One is free kisses.  Another is permission to stay in Japan.  I got my new visa today, and due to Japan&rsquo;s new system, it&rsquo;s <em>not</em> a sticker in my passport.  It&rsquo;s in a chip in my new card.  And it expires in only a year.  Gah.  I wonder why it expires so soon; I used to get three year visas by being a programmer.</p>

<p>Lin chose to stay at home partially because Sabina wanted to go to a bug museum, er house, er shop in Nakano called Mushisha.  We found a <em>different</em> bug shop on the same street, which was easier to find; I expect it&rsquo;s trying to get foot traffic of people who can&rsquo;t find Mushisha.</p>

<p>Sabina was all excited and begged me to let her buy one, but I was like, &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t be able to take it to the US,&rdquo; and she&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;well, will you take care of it for me after I leave?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure Lin wouldn&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really easy to take care of; they just eat jelly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Most of the bugs had little bug jello shots in their cages.  I guess that&rsquo;s what bugs are into these days.</p>

<hr />

<p>Before that, we went back to the B1 level stage and saw some really sweet instruments, costumes, and amazing music performed by a gamelan from Bali.  (I think it&rsquo;s a gamelan, and not a group called Gamelan.)  Basically all the instruments were percussion, most of which were brass(?), either like xylophones or bells of various sizes from small bowls to gongs.  Wow I want to get a CD of the music!</p>

<hr />

<p>Before that, we went to the top of the Metropolitan Government building in Shinjuku to the 45th floor observatory of the North tower.  Sabina was like, &ldquo;the city just goes forever!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;yep&rdquo;</p>

<p>She enjoyed the crazy stuff being sold in the souvenir shop, and I was like, &ldquo;but wait look at <em>these</em>,&rdquo; and showed her the shinkansen-shaped chopsticks.  i really wanted to buy some, but couldn&rsquo;t bear to spend that much on plastic sticks.  She, being in vacation mode, was like, &ldquo;these are so coool!!&rdquo; and bought them.  Nice.</p>

<hr />

<p>Before that, we saw some guys dressed like dragon-deer-bamboos, and carrying drums.  Going to see them led us to a stage on the B1 level next to the street.  We watched them perform, and then saw some really cool shaky wooden instruments being played.  I volunteered to play one of them when it was time for audience participation.  Fun times!</p>

<hr />

<p>Before that, we took the train from Kawasaki to Shinjuku.</p>

<hr />

<p>Before that, we were at home trying to figure out Sabina&rsquo;s schedule while Tariq and I worked on getting our app finished and submitted.  Turns out one must turn off png compression.  WTF would they make compression be on by default?  I sure as heck didn&rsquo;t turn it on manually.</p>

<hr />

<p>After all of that, we took Sobu Line to Akihabara where we wandered around a bit.  I was most intrigued by a physical version of the table flipping game.</p>

<p>Lin and I had great fun yesterday with Sabina, including:</p>

<p>1) Sabina repeatedly saying, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s so cooolll!&rdquo; as she found another cool bug/insect/arthropod/critter walking among the wet leaves in Meiji-Jingu</p>

<p>4) Totally taking a nap on a hammock-bench thing on the top floor of a new building in Omote-Sando.  I really enjoyed this and wish we had some photos&hellip; The building is on the interesection of Omote-Sando-Dori and Meiji-Dori opposite the Condomania building.  Go to the top, following the small green arrows marked with three green pine trees and number of meters remaining to our destination.  Greeted with coffee shops, outdoor stools leashed to the ground around a bar surrounding a glass skylite, down through which I couldn&rsquo;t see anything because the glass seemed cloudy and I didn&rsquo;t try to hard, we could look through the rooftop trees out over edge of the building through the glass to keep us on the building.</p>

<p>We found three adjacent stools around the bar, but as soon as we were sitting down, Lin noticed a hammock bench was available behind us.  It has a view through the glass, on which I could see the reflection of a building behind our building.  I planted myself in the middle of the bench so I could be between Lin and Sabina, and we Lin promptly fell asleep.  Sabina and I talked a bit about how people&rsquo;s musculature twitches, er I mean <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasciculation">fasciculation</a> while falling asleep.</p>

<p>I said to Sabina, &ldquo;I really love this one,&rdquo; where &ldquo;this one&rdquo; meant Lin, but I didn&rsquo;t want to wake her up by saying her name.</p>

<p>Sabina was like, &ldquo;Lin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;yeah&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s really nice to see how much you two love each other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>5) The Pink Cow!  Lin went home, and Sabina and I went to The Pink Cow for the Mooooooving Party, as The Pink Cow is moving from Shibuya to Roppongi!  Lensei was on keyboard with his amazing skillz freestyling with the cow jammers (Jon and Jin??) on drums and bass guitar, with their amazing skillz.</p>

<p>Saw <a href="https://www.fudworks.daportfolio.com/">Roy</a>, Peter (who will be performing this Tuesday night at Double Tall Cafe&rsquo; in Shibuya), Leslie, who I got to massage and who showed me pictures of her 7mo baby Annalise, Traci, looking genki and sexy in her wedding dress (marrying the Roppongi Pink Cow), DJ Miki, who I probably haven&rsquo;t seen in the longest time.</p>

<p>Great to see &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1A8yAfR0ww">David Whitaker (lovemademusic)</a>&rdquo; and his wife perform a few songs..  man, such power! and such passion! I want to buy an album of his stuff.</p>

<p>Marcellus performed some poetry, three different ones including &ldquo;Jazz Man&rdquo; I think.</p>

<p>JJ Vicars was on as we left; I gave him a pat on the knee as he was playing and in no position to hug!!</p>

<p>So tired on the way home after such an awesome day!</p>
