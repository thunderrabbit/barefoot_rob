                        <p class=date>1:39am JST Saturday 27 December 2003</p>

<p>Morag and I worked at KQ today.  Notable:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It was the last day before our New Year's vacation.</p></li>

<li><p>I did a level check over ginganet for Hiyoshi (the school where
    Jen works; the station where Cory lives; one station away from
    Tsunashima) today.  This was my first ginganet anything.  I rated
    the student a solid level 4.  Definitely good enough to hold a
    conversation on any common topic.  Definitely had natural pauses
    and, um, hesitation devices, and was a great fun student to chat
    with.  Excellent comprehension at normal speed speech and good
    comprehension with high speed speech.</p>

<p>I wondered about ways to get her digits, but chose against any such
  behavior at that moment; she could be a Hiyoshi staff member for all
  I know.</p></li>

<li><p>Morag had a class of three students; one of whom gave little or
    no input, the other two of whom gave little or no input cause they
    were so busy flirting with one another.  She was really mad when
    she got out of that lesson.  I had the same three students plus
    one more student; I was ready to not be ruffled by any
    antics.</p>

<p>I got in there and (this story is going too slow for how tired I
  am right now) was "alright; you guys listen and then ask some
  questions."  I read 5 lines of text and they couldn't ask any
  quetions.  I read it again, and they still couldn't.  I prompted
  them with questions about the five lines and then read and then
  had them ask the questions.</p>

<p>They were able to get through this, and it took a long time.</p>

<p>Then I was all, alright; here are your 4 new questions for the next
  section, and I read the section and had them listen to the next
  part.  The first question: "how many times has Kay been here?"
  second: "how long has Doug been coming here?"  third: "who believes
  in ghosts and why?"  fourth: "what was Doug doing when he saw the
  ghost?"</p>

<p>First question took nearly five minutes to ask and answer.  One
  person asking (trying to repeat the question accurately) and the
  other three trying to get the correct answer.  One knew the
  grammar, and the other knew the answer.</p>

<p>Second question was answered, "Doug has been here for 2 hours,"
  which is true, but not the correct answer for the question.  "Good
  grammar; wrong answer."</p>

<p>((* I'm too tired to get a play by play written but *))</p>

<p>"Okay, please ask your question again"</p>

<p>"How long has Doug been coming here?"</p>

<p>"Okay, please repeat: how long has Doug been here?"</p>

<p>"Okay, please answer."</p>

<p>It took several variants of the above conversation before I was
  like, "please listen: How long has Doug been coming here?  How long
  has Doug been here?  This is really important that you
  understand."</p>

<p>Finally, somehow, they understood. Such a beautiful sight to see
  the lightbulbs in their minds. They were able to correctly ask and
  answer each question.  But we still had two more questions to go.</p>

<p>Slogged through the third question which they answered with some
  difficulty, and then to the fourth question.</p>

<p>"What was Doug doing before he saw the ghost?"</p>

<p>"He was sitting before he saw the ghost."</p>

<p>"Correct grammar."</p>

<p>"bicycle."</p>

<p>"Yes.  Please make a sentence."</p>

<p>"He bicycle riding ghost the he saw before."</p>

<p>"Please give your answer again."</p>

<p>"He was sitting before he saw the ghost."</p>

<p>"Okay, please change the answer to bicycle."  (I noticed that this
  was not a trivial change, but oh well.)</p>

<p>"He was bicycle riding before he saw the ghost."</p>

<p>"Close.  Please repeat.  " (at this point the bell rang.  School
  is out for the winter break.  I can go home and sleep.)</p>

<p>"Please repeat: He was riding his bicycle before he saw the
ghost."</p>

<p>I made all four students correctly repeat that phrase before they
  left.</p>
</ol>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Relayed the story to Morag who felt quite vindicated.  I was really
  happy cause though I may have been rough on them, they fucking
  learned something.  Excellent.</p>
</li>

<p>Miki, oh Miki made me sad tonight.  I invited her to Ginza with me
  and Jen and Orivia and Grace, but we are meeting at 5 while Miki
  gets off work at 6.  Okay, just meet us, right?  False.</p>

<p>"I can't read a map, so I can't meet you.  I have never been to
Ginza."</p>

<p>"Mate.  You. can. do. it."</p>

<p>too late.  done deal.  she's not coming.</p>

<p>I practiced releasing.  I felt sad.  I can't date anyone who would
  give up that easily slash not believe in themselves enough to try.</p>

<p>I won't see her until next year.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I've fallen asleep multiple times during this entry.  I'm going to
  Odaiba with Carla, Clayton and Benny tomorrow.  I wanna get a
  disposeable camera before we go.</p>

<p>sleepy time now.</p>

<p>Have spent time sending emails this morning.  Including to Marta
  who would like to make peace with me.  I replied yes I'd like to,
  but I can't right now.</p>

<p>I'm glad she and Fred are doing cool stuff together (hosting
  advisor weekend type stuff)</p>

<p>I made the first step toward getting a counselor.  I asked Morag
  to bring to work the Volunteer Directory that N H-Y gave to me when
  I was interested in forming a warrior network in Japan.  Now I need
  the network for myself.  Not for Japan.</p>

<p>going to meditate for a bit then get ready for work.</p>

<p>Just now getting home from my day.</p>

<p>Work is a faded memory.  Had some students.  Taught some lessons.
  Went with Neil, Andrew and Phong to get some food for Carla's
  Christmas pot luck party.  I led the way kinda to her house.  Good
  stuff.  I bought lettuce at Carla's request.  Nice to be part of the
  group.</p>

<p>Party was fun; lots of talking and chowing after the staff arrived
  (Rumi, Tomoko, Junko, Masayo, and Rumi's friend Kyouko).  Nothing
  really big except someone said something really funny but I don't
  remember what it was.  Woulda written it down had I had my
  computer.  Um...  I can't remember.</p>

<p>Yuuko called me during the party and invited me to New Year's with
  her and I hesitated then accepted.  She's the first to directly
  invite me to something, so okay.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>People left around 11:30pm to catch the last trains and I stayed,
  along with Lyle, Clayton, Rumi, Tomoko, Junko, Kyouko, Carla.  We
  went to the nearby bar where I learned some Japanese vocab including
  のどちんこ and others.</p>

<p>I talked to Kyouko and learned that she works for a travel agency
  and part of her job includes leading youth group tours overseas.</p>

<p>bang.</p>

<p>Didn't ask for her number, but that part of her job description
  was duly noted in my mind.</p>

<p>Went back to Carla's just before 5am and the trains started at that
  time so instead of trying to sleep there (as fun as my imagination
  could make it be with a bunch of cute Japanese women), I opted to
  come home to sleep.  Kyouko came with me as far as Yokohama station
  where she took a JR line to Shinjuku.</p>

<p>Ohhhhhhh big lucky news is that my Friday teacher called me and
  cancelled our lesson which is really good news cause I basically had
  forgotten about the lesson.  Oh lucky day.</p>

<p>Bed time.  But I want to call my parentals briefly first.</p>

<p>Just wrote a card to send to Wende, but it took a while cause I
  put some Pooh magnets and a chocolate coin in between two cards and
  on the front of the card it says</p>

<pre>
Happy Christmas and the
like!  I Hope your holidays
rule and that you get
to have the best elfa
sale experience EVER and
that your family is great
and Peter, Tinkerbell and that
other cat are great and
that you like the chocolate
and longer lasting Pooh magnets
</pre>

<p>At which point I realized when she reads the card she won't have
  seen the magnets and it would spoil the surprise.  So, I added a
  sticky flap that says CENSORED UNTIL PACKAGE IS OPENED, but it took
  two point five tries to get it right.</p>

<p>Maybe this is why I'm loathe to send things; each one must be Aries
  calibre greatest thing <em>ever</em>.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Leaving now to send the card, buy some raw spinach, eat it (and
  maybe eat some non-raw eggs) and then meet ゆうこ in Kawasaki.</p>

<p><p><b>Comment:</b>
<br>I can relate. I read a letter 1000 times before I send it. And I would say something like &ldquo;oh don&rsquo;t worry about what you write, people already think you are the greatest&rdquo; but they would just be words. I mean, blah blah. perfectionism is cool<br>

<p>I'm in a fucking pissed off mood now after talking to janette and
  bringing to light the issues of the evening which is I love too many
  women and just want to have the comfort of women who love me to be
  around me and I don't want to go to counciling and I hate everything
  that has to do with not having women gush over me all the time and I
  sure as fuck don't want to do any couciling in Japan and everyone
  can just bite me and fuck off.</p>

<p>Yes, ma, there is a lot of anger in me.  Where the fuck did it
  come from I don't know but punching plastic bottles full of water
  didn't get rid of all of it.  Just hurt my hands a little bit,
  fortunately not my wrist any more than it already is.</p>

<p>I hate writing in my journal every day I hate not having a big
  project to pour my heart and soul into I hate not knowing what the
  fuck I'm supposed to be doing in the world and I hate thinking that
  the right answer is within my heart somewhere and all I have to do
  is ask for it and it will come.  No, I hate knowing that apparently
  I'm not ready to know the answer.  Matrix kinda shit, the choice has
  been made and we just have to understand the reason for the
  choice.</p>

<p>I hate that I pour my heart into my journal everyday and I get
  nothing from it.  I hate thinking that I get nothing from it.  I
  hate thinking that the something should be in the form of cash sent
  to my paypal account.</p>

<p>I'm thankful that my mom sent me cash for Christmas (to my papal
  account).</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>"it has become apparent that I need to find a counselor in Japan.
  I can easily find a hundred excuses and difficulties in finding a
  counselor.  I just need to set aside my drug of choice (women) for
  long enough (and not just rot in my room like I did yesterday) to
  find a counselor and then to trust that every week it's worth my
  time to go to that counselor each week consistently (the way I go to
  Japanese lesson)."</p>

<p>I've got to let you go to take care of myself.  (and punch some
  water bottles and bang out this journal entry and brush my teeth
  and cry in bed.)</p>

<p>Tomorrow the drug is in the form of a party at Carla's house.
  Friday the drug is Miki and other students and teachers at Wara
  Wara.  Saturday the drug is going out with Miki and Dan and the
  girls upstairs.  Sunday I curl up and die. But I won't physically
  die; don't worry.</p>

<p>I persevere.</p>

Merry Christmas, Rob!

It's good to know that you're liking Japan better, learning students'
names, and recognizing how much you've learned. You could look at the
past nine months as a fantastic Christmas gift to yourself!

We'll be going to Jill's this afternoon to exchange gifts, then to
Live Oak for a Christmas Eve service. At least this year the kids
won't be climbing all over you! I'll be thinking of you, though.

How will you spend your days off?

I've been kind of bummed since we exchanged a couple of heavy duty
letters and you haven't written since. Are you mad? sad? irritated?
indifferent? satisfied?

Alicia is leaving Christmas morning to see her mom in Lawrence,
KS. Karina will arrive Christmas night and wants some Thai food for
dinner. In between, Jon and I will go caroling at Safe Place, a
shelter for battered women and their children. Everyone's name had to
be submitted ahead of time and we have to take photo IDs with us. We
don't even know the location yet.

Karina's mother Georgette will be in Austin Jan. 30-31. The two of
them will probably see each other for the first time in 12 years. They
are both terrified. Karina has felt abandoned by her mother most of
her life. After a big dispute 12 years ago, the passage of time made
it more and more difficult to bridge the gap. Now Georgette has lung
cancer. It may be small cell cancer, one of the fastest and most
virulent kinds. This may well be Karina and Georgette's only time to
see each other. They still love each other on some level, but there's
a lot of anger piled on top of it.

Have a very happy holiday. I love you!

Hi Ma

Thanks for the updates.

I'm in a shit mood now cause I'm really scared about healing this part
of me that I despise so much.  I don't want to hurt any more women and
I don't want to not use women as my comfort and I can rationalize my
behavior since I haven't kissed or had sex with any women in Japan
cept Janette but in my heart I know there is still something to be
healed and I just can barely even consider the idea that it's possible
to heal and that it's possible that I will survive the process and
that it's possible I will still be myself on the other side.

I'm completely wrapped up in myself and I have to pretend like I'm not
and pretend like I care about other people so that they will care
about me and I say that cause i get all these emails (I HAVE OVER 400
EMAILS IN MY INBOX!!!) and I'm like, 'yay nice email' and I don't
reply cause I'm just wrapped up in myself and just want the drug of
emails coming in = love coming in.  fuck.

That's why I haven't written to you.  I'm hardly taking care of myself
and have no energy to be like, "oh shit that sounds fucked up about
Karina and her mom" and I can see it on an intellectual level how hard
that must be but I have no emotional energy left to really feel it and
send her love and light to help.

I have no big plans for my days off; I'm afraid I'll just rot in my
room like I did yesterday and not study Japanese like my big
aspiration says I should do and god I just hate this.

Thanks for listening.  I don't need you to counter or soothe each
point; just hearing me is enough.

Somewhere in all this I love you and wish you well.

    With Love
    - Rob

ps: thank you so much for the money.  Now I'm suddenly crying; thank
you thank you for continuing to love me even though i feel so
unlovable.

<p>Met 裕子 at Cinecitta.  We ate at Freshness Burger where I told her
  in the best Japanese I could muster the story of the movie Changing
  Lanes then came to my house to watch Changing Lanes.</p>

<p>The story was a bit difficult or uninteresting for her to follow,
  so we didn't make it much past the middle.  Looked through the pics
  on my computer instead.  There's over 3000 pictures so we didn't
  make it to the middle before I had to go back to Cinecitta to meet
  Haneda Miki (not KG Miki).  On the way back I was a bit distracted
  with monitoring my emotional etc internal senses, wondering slash
  noticing how dis/similar that was to having two girlfriends and
  watching as I wrangled with ditching one for the other and which one
  and what if we were all just friends which we officially are, and
  Haneda Miki is off my list anyway cause she smokes, but I felt like
  I owed her dinner cause she paid for mine some time ago etc etc
  etc.</p>

<p>8 minutes late to meet Miki and I couldn't tell if she was upset
  (it's a challenge for me to read Japanese poker faces) at me being
  late or at Yuuko being there too, or not upset at all.  gah</p>

<p>Went to a kaitein sushi, which was Miki's first time to visit and I
  was intrigued by what seeeemed to be a switch thrown on the kaitein
  sushi track, cause when we were invited to our seats, there were no
  sushis in front of us on the moving conveyor, but then some began to
  appear and it was all one big conveyor linked with the other parts
  of the bar, which did have sushi before.</p>

<p>Ate, then went to see Bad Boys II at Cinecitta after we wandered
  around the game center and ended up not going to the プリクラ to get
  pictures taken (cause it was too crowded).  Bad Boys II was
  surprisingly long and had lots of killer diller car chases and
  shootemups and I'm like dammmmn what is the budget for this
  movie?</p>

<p>Talked with janette for about an hour; described to her (oh shit I
  wonder if this will become a large "sidetrack" to my day) what I had
  just recently read about <a
  href="https://www.theharrowgroup.com/articles/20031222/20031222.htm#_Toc59533105">computing
  technology</a> and changes that will need to be made before
  TIPS can be harnessed effectively.</p>

<p>Sidetrack avoided.  I'm not going to try and solve this bottleneck
  right now.</p>

<p>I am going to fuck with my website though.</p>

<p>Watched <em>Changing Lanes</em> today with Dan and John. Before
  the movie started John moved on the chair and it made a farting
  noise and he goes, "haha, that sounds kinda bad doesn't it?" in a
  way that made me think <em>grow up.  Say "excuse me" or "ooh nice
  one" or something that's at least one step above an implication of
  a joke but not actually a joke</em>.</p>

<p>I ignored him like I hadn't heard him.</p>

<p>But then, he laughed when, in the movie, a guy at a 12 step meeting
  goes, "I've been sober for 15 days."  That shit is *not* funny.
  Really wonder why I'm getting so worked up about him.</p>

<p>I noticed yesterday that he reminds me of Alan M from
  Telecheck.</p>

<p>In the middle of the movie, I got an email from Mieko, "I'm in
  Kawasaki; where should I wait for you?" because I had emailed her
  earlier, 今晩、食べませんか。 (you wanna chow tonight?)  And I was
  like "oh fuck" cause it seemed strange to have invited her to eat
  and then gotten food myself (but she didn't reply immediately;
  obviously it took more than 1 hour cause we had watched half the
  movie and it took me 20 minutes to go <em>get</em> my food)..</p>

<p>Blah blah blah, we met and had a fun time though all the stores
  were closed and the first kaitein sushi place was not a sushi place
  at all, and we left after only the appetizers (story is being
  adjusted for cultural differences; I don't have the language to
  explain it succinctly either in English or Japanese) and she paid.
  Got hot cocoa and tea at Starbucks and I paid and then we chilled on
  the steps between Azalea and 川崎 station and just chatted.</p>

<p>I think our friendship will survive the miscommunication due to my
  inviting her to eat and then eating alone; we had fun.</p>
