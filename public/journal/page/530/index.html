<p>Gang, remember at UH we turned in some of our projects
electronically?  And the prof would say, "don't touch the files after
[the deadline]"???</p>

<p>Marcel and I later learned of the unix command "touch," which can
be used to alter the modification time of a file.  We wondered if the
prof's statement was a subtle way of saying "don't use touch," while
not telling us that such a thing existed.</p>

<p>But the point of this story is that I have just modified all the
files in the g3 project using emacs, and I used the unix command touch
to set the modification date to 4:20, so that it will be easy to tell
if a file is modified after today.</p>

<p>Nice.</p>

<p>"The Titanic, once consider unsinkable, sank in
only 2.5 hours."</p>

<p>Thus read the Quaker instant oatmeal packet.  I
read it and immediately spotted the typo.</p>

<p>A <em>typo</em> on an oatmeal packet?  Millions and
millions of packets out in the world, and they all
have a typo on them?  Wow.</p>

<p>So I called their 800 number, which is something
like 800-555-OATS, and explained the error to the
woman who answered.  I was pleased that she
immediately understood the point of me calling.  "I'm
just concerned about little kids learning incorrect
grammar by eating oatmeal."  "Oh yes," she agreed, "I
understand exactly.  May I put you on hold?"</p>

<p>I waited on hold for a bit.  She came back, "we
would like to retrieve the sample you have; we will
send you a sample retrieval envelope within 7 to 10
days.  We will also send you a coupon good for a free
box of oatmeal."</p>

<p>Wow!</p>

<p>Oatmeal!  yip yip yip yip yip yip!  Auuhah Auuhah. 
(inside joke)</p>

<p>I dug through the rest of the box and found one
more packet (unopened) that had the same error on it. 
I'll give them the opened packet, and save the
unopened packet, and sell it on eBay, under
"Collectors Items - Food Stuffs - Breakfast - Instant
Oatmeal - Misspellings"</p>

<p>I'm in an excellent mood tonight, which is a
welcome change from lately.  The reason?
--&gt;&nbsp;Wende is open to the idea of us selling
our house and taking a bicycle tour around Europe.</p>

<p>I'm not suggesting that we miss a bunch of rallies,
but maybe we can squeeze in a tour for a month or two
and miss 1 rally.  Or maybe we say fuckit and stay
longer.  Maybe we can actually look at a calendar and
not just theorize.</p>

<p>Thing is, she's actually <em>considering</em> it! 
Thinking about how we can do this thing!  I
<em>never</em> want to leave advising SWD YRUU, but I
also have to follow my dreams, and come back with some
pretty awesome stories, -!<em>!And!</em>!- be able to
say with confidence to my beloved youth, "you can do
it; here's how."</p>

<p>I'm still floating with glee from the incredible
time at SWUUSI.. I'm thankful for happy happiness all
around!</p>

<p>On the way out of work today, I realized that I
wanna shift my life in a significant way.  I think I
might ride my bicycle across the US, or across Texas
to start.  Or actually, just ride my bike to my dad's
house this weekend and back.</p>

<p>As I went by Francisco-the-valet, who works across
the street from my work, he motioned clearly for me to
come over. </p>

<p>I met his son, Ed, who has been traveling from
state to state, documenting his life through
pictures.</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>I'm documenting my life through words.  I could
ride my bike around the US and go on adventures like
Jules in Pulp Fiction.  After his hitman days, of
course.</p>

<p>Wende is not a full-blown proponent of me riding to
my dad's house as my first trek.  She suggests that I
work up to it.  I saw the ride to my dad's house as a
good work-up to ride.  Maybe I can ride to Maggie's
house.</p>

<p>The good thing about this proposed trek is that
Wende and I are scheduled to visit my dad's house this
Saturday, so I wouldn't have to ride back.  I could
leave at 6am and ride while it's cool; she can just
meet me there later.  Perfect.</p>

<p>Or I can just ride to Maggie's and then Wende can
pick me up there on her way to my dad's house.</p>

<p>I just called Maggie; that is the most likely plan.
 Yay!!</p>

<p>We drove 675 miles from Oklahoma to South
Padre.</p>

<p>We got a 1 hour extension from the hotel on our
11am leaving time.  Made it out by 11:50AM. I was
pretty grumpy-tired while packing..  I just want to be
home.  All this shit in the fridge I don't want to
pack.  It's just ice cream topping crap.  And cokes
and stuff.</p>

<p>The causeway off the island was fully backed up
with a bus apparently blocking 1 lane, as some traffic
was getting through.</p>

<p>We stopped at the local mall to watch <em>Cats and
Dogs</em>, but the first showing wasn't for 2 hours. 
I climbed over a banister thing that was intended to
be blocked off so I could visit the third floor of the
mall.  Nothing too interesting but a few empty shops
and a big empty gumball machine.</p>

<p>Back down to the truck and by this time, the
causeway was clear.  Nice.</p>

<p>I'm in a much happier mood now that we are driving.
 Actually Wende is driving, but now that we are headed
home.</p>

<p class=date>4:50 pm</p>

<p>Wende and I haven't talked while she's been driving
and I've been reading the Big Rally Book Four and
creating an index.  I told her I wasn't sure about
getting married and I want to get a counselor and
figure it out more.  I don't know what the fuck I
want.</p>

<p>I'm going to drive now.</p>

<p>I made breakfast of scrambled eggs cook-combined
with bread and butter with pimento cheese spread
blopped into it and mixed, but not cooked.</p>

<p class=date>11:10 am</p>

<p> I think I'm experiencing post-SWUUSI depression. 
I'm with Wende and her family on their family reunion,
and I am not excited; I just keep thinking about my
wonderful youth.</p>

<p>We're going to <em>Mexico</em>, for goodness sakes,
and I've never previously been, but I'm not excited. 
I'm in South Padre Island, and I've never previously
been, but I'm not excited.</p>

<p>Actually, as I type this, we are driving through
Harlingen, to which I had never previously been, but
I'm not excited.</p>

<!--

And now we're talking about marriage stuff and I'm
pretty freaked out about it.

--->

<p class=date>1:47 pm</p>

<p>So we're officially in Mexico, but only in the
tourist pile of stores right on the border. 
Distinction between poverty and not poverty is
possibly the line of street vendors selling candy and
necklaces and necklaces and jesus crosses and
yourname-on-a-grain-of-rice, and hats and fans and
other crap.   Kids are begging on the street, adults
are begging on the street.</p>

<p>On the way over the bridge, walking across the rio
grande little kids and adults with bottles of bleach
with the bottoms cut off, looking like funnels on
large sticks to catch money.  Please money give money
a nickel, nickel please.  hands begging.</p>

<p>Even in the restaurant we are in, the electricity
has browned out.  I am so confused by the (dichotomy,
contradiction, wacked-ness) that we can eat nice food
and not finish it all, but not give food to peeps
outside.</p>

<p>Oh, also, the Rio Grande river is not very
wide.</p>

<p class=date>5:10 pm</p>

<p>We're back; going to the beach.</p>

<p>I slept for about 1.25 hours, down at the end of
the road.</p>

<p>Ellen seems to have recovered nicely; she just
mentioned that she is going to win the next game of
silent football that she plays.</p>

<p>Closing circle/worship was hot as the sun, but
nice.  We wrote/read blessings from the week.</p>

<p>Hugs to peeps as they are leaving at random moments
like photons leaving an excited atom.</p>

<p>Heidi just told me that she has been inspired by me
to be a youth advisor.  What an incredible
blessing.</p>

<p>(note: a few of you have said that, and it's an
incredible blessing each tiime.  I'm grateful to be
here for you.)</p>

<p>Bryn walked up to me. She was crying.</p>

<p>"Rob, may I have a hug?"</p>

<p>"Of course, my angel," and I put down = dropped the
stuff in my hands and hugged her so tightly for
minutes as she cried.</p>

<p>"I've just been losing so many friends this month,"
referring to her Aussie mates and YRUU homies.</p>

<p>I feel blessed by her emotions.</p>

<p>Hugs and tears from Elizabeth, who believes this is
her last YRUU experience.</p>

<p>I told her to write me; I will write back.  (I'll
write back to any of you who write me.)</p>

<p>Chilled until about 12:30 while we determined where
to meet Sean & Joey's dad, and where to find Danny's
mom.</p>

<p>Sleep time for me.</p>

<p>I have basically just woken up; I fell asleep
remembering the clear tones of that dance which Noah
and AJ did while hanging from the rafters.  You know
the one.</p>

<p>Good stuff.</p>

<p>Thank you all so much for a great SWUUSI!</p>

<p>Wende and I are in West, Texas (note the comma
between the city name and state name) getting kolaches
for the family reunion.  Yes, it's in South Padre
Island.  Check it out on a map.</p>

<p class=date>7:07 pm</p>

<p>We're munching at a pretty nice Taco Bell in
Lockhart, Texas.  Seating for about 60 people. 
Bathrooms clean and big.</p>

<p class=date>9:34 pm</p>

<p>I really love my handspring visor and
keyboard!!!</p>

<p>I also really enjoy haing rechargable bateries for
it.  These rechargeable batteries that I used fr all
of SWUUSI lasted... for all of SWUUSI!  The visor just
now said the bateries are low.  So I popped in the
pair I ad carried in my pocket the entire week just in
case hey went dead during SWUUSI.  Which they
didn't.</p>

<p>I have been reading through the Rally Book Four,
which I <em>essentially</em> had never previously
read.  I'm keeping track of entries in it so I can
creae an index, like I did for the first rally book. 
It really isn't too difficult to create an index; maye
someone will for books 2 and 3.   Book four is
officially full (I'm pretty sure).</p>

<p>That means we will begin Rally Book Five.  Fucking
Five Rally Books!!  So amazing, and such a superbly
awesome history of YRUU in SWD.  I am so honored that
YRUU embraced mky idea.  Started the first one by
copying pages out of my diary that peeps had signed at
either Houston, LDC, OKC, 1996 (I think!!)</p>

<p>Now we have four full books and Sean Bibby will be
purchasing number five.  This is the first one that I
have no purchased, which further prooves that the
youth have taken ownership of this history-recording
project (the first proof is that Sean has been
maintaining all four volumes for the entire duration
of Book Four's creation, proved because I hadn't
previously  read any of it.)</p>

<p class=date>9:47 pm</p>

<p>Wende and I have driven 448.9 miles today; we are a
few hours from South Padre.  Tomorrow we are going to
Mexico, which is especially cool since, believe it or
not, I have never been to Mexico.</p>

<p>And on Sunday we are going parasailing!!!</p>

<p>Wende's mom was all, 'and <em>think</em> about
parasailig on Sunday,'</p>

<p>And I'm like what's to think about?  Parasailing =
of course I'm going!!!</p>

<p class=message>I am really grumpy right now because
I'm so tired.  So tired.  Rob fell asleep around
Beeville which was about 3.5 or 4 hours ago and i've
been driving.   I've been trying to do most of the
driving since he only got 1 hour of sleep last night
which makes my 5 seem luxurious, but I was actually
getting worried about our safety when I finally woke
him up.  We were able to get cash at this gas station
and I needed to go to the bathroom.  I tried the door
and  it wouldn't open.  I waited around with Rob for a
while and even asked the attendant if the door should
open.  He said that if it was locked, someone was in
there.  So finally I asked Rob to stand outside the
men's door while I went in there.  It was stinky and
had lots of crude stuff on the walls and doors.  When
I came out, the attendant was at the women's restroom
and the door opened right up.  Great. About 2 hours
ago,  I stopped for candy and gas and Rob barely woke
up.  He's been snoring.  Yes, that's right, snoring. 
The good news is that we're almost there.  I so want
to be sleeping.  Oh, and i have a rash on the back of
my neck that itches.  Grrrrrrrrr.</p>

<p class=date>2:08 am</p>

<p>We have just arrived.  Wende is in a pissy pissy
pissy grumpy mood because she is so tired and afraid
the truck will be towed becuse of where we have to
park.</p>

<p>I thnk it will be okay.  She's also mad that I'm
typing.  bye.</p>

<p class=date>2:33 am</p>

<p>We're in our room.  Twin beds.  Wende is still
getting ready for bed; I'm going to sleep now.</p>

July 2001</p>

<p>We left for the Bridging Ceremony on 3 school
buses.  About an hour ride.. I talk to  Lawren, Bryn,
David and then slept most of the way.  Move up to the
front seat and lay down, with my legs stretched over
the aisle.  Nice bed.</p>

I am so crying at bridging ceremony.  I didn't
really cry just thinking about these cats leaving, but
when I <em>saw</em> the transition.  the love.  The..
depth of compassion.  I cried.  a lot.</p>

<p>At the end of the ceremony, we had two concentric
circles of people singing good friends.  At the end of
that, I got gang-hugged by some of the youth, which
was quite an enjoyable surprise, but my knee scab got
ripped off.</p>

<p>My mom was there, anti-surprised that I was
bleeding, and she got me the hookup with Joe the camp
nurse.  Got the cut cleaned up and sealed and
stuff.</p>

<p class=date>soulful sundown</p>

<p>Haha rap and roll.</p>

<p>We are at the Soulful Sundown service.   They're
doing a skit thing about the need to update the stinky
current common adult services.   The adults are
laughing.  But I don't really see the youth
laughing.</p>

<p class=date>9:28 pm</p>

<p>John Clendenon cut his head by jumpig too quickly
onto the bus.  When I saw him, he had blookd pooled in
hi hand, blood draining dow the back of his neck. and
blood leaking in front of his right ear.  bloody and
messy.</p>

<p>He's inside the air conditioned lodge getting
fixed, and we are in the anti-air conditioned bus
while the bus drivers write up  report on what
happened..</p>

<p>A youth just got off the bus saying they had to go
to the restroom, but was escorted back on.  I guess we
are leaving soon.  I hope it isn't a potty emergency
(a la Animaiacs)</p>
