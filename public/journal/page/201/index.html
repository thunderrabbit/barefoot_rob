<h2 id="21-37-tuesday-26-may-2015-jst">21:37 Tuesday 26 May 2015 JST</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing some scripts to simplify publishing to my website.
Here on local computer I&rsquo;ve got a script called
<code>build-journal-and-stuff.sh</code>, which basically pushes changes from my
local journal repo to the origin repo (for backup purposes), then
switches to my local Middleman repo&rsquo;s submodule for my journal, pulls
the entries from origin and then goes back to Middleman&rsquo;s root and
builds the site.</p>

<p>Today on b.robnugen.com, I&rsquo;ve been creating a Perl script to spin
through all the image directories and create thumbnails if they don&rsquo;t
exist.  So far I&rsquo;ve got it to skip the check for thumbnail
directories, and determine if the thumbnail exists for all images in
the main directories.</p>

<p>PerlMagick is installed on the server and it looks like it&rsquo;ll be
pretty easy to load the images and create thumbnails.  I might even
get it done tonight.</p>

<p>The next plan is to create indicies in each directory which will make
&ldquo;normal&rdquo; pages of thumbnails as commonly exist on image galleries.
I&rsquo;m sure there must be software that does this, and I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve
loaded such software on robnugen.com, so I might look at that first.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a 1% chance I&rsquo;ll figure out how to do it with a static site
generator, a 19% chance I&rsquo;ll do it with a pre-made thingabobble, and
80% chance I&rsquo;ll hack some shit together which will work for a while
but not have nice connections between the pages, have no way to search
by tags / date / keywords and generally be crappy.</p>

<p>Hmm.. maybe I should rethink my percentages.</p>

<p>Had lessons with both M &amp; M tonight.  During both lessons I tried to
do more role play than I normally do with them.  They tend to veer
toward just checking homework instead of actually practicing English.
M had done a huge amount of homework (as she usually does), but I
didn&rsquo;t check it all tonight; I was like, &ldquo;okay, let&rsquo;s practice this
part..&rdquo;  (meet vs see)</p>

<p>I went to the conveni (again), forgetting that my wallet is running on
fumes. Got to the register with a grand total of 233 yen worth of
chocolate and ピルクル.  I dumped out my change pocket into the tray
and discovered four coins, totaling 121 yen worth of change.</p>

<p>何ポイントがありますか？　&rdquo;How many points are on my point card?&rdquo;</p>

<p>百六十。&rdquo;160&rdquo;</p>

<p>じゃ、&rdquo;Okay then..&rdquo;  233 - 121 =  百十二ポイントで &ldquo;.. 112 points.&rdquo;</p>

<p>ちょっと待って。&rdquo;Just a moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went and got a calculator to figure out how many points I&rsquo;d need to
use.</p>

<p>As he came back, I repeated 百十二 twice, nicely in Japanese.  He
finally heard me and goes, 速いですね。  Um, not really, but thanks!</p>

<p>Finished #1 above.  It turns out it was working, oops, nevermind.</p>

<h2 id="15-39">15:39</h2>

<p>actually #3 isn&rsquo;t done yet, but I&rsquo;ve done as much as possible for now.
It&rsquo;s weird.  There&rsquo;s a website which exists at t.example.com but it&rsquo;s
not shown in the list of DNS records at the example.com registrar.  I
guess there&rsquo;s another list somewhere which tells what to do with
t.example.com.  I&rsquo;ll ask Alfonzo tomorrow if my d.example.com doesn&rsquo;t
work by this time tomorrow.</p>

<p>Funny: Y left cause he explained everything he needed to explain.
Then S was translating it for me and I was like, &ldquo;well it works here&rdquo;
and she checked and it worked for her too.  She went upstairs to ask
Y, but he was gone.  I go, &ldquo;I bet he&rsquo;s at the conveni&rdquo; so we went
there and saw Y or a guy who looks just like Y reading magazines.  I
got a drink and we headed back to find Y walking up the stairs ahead
of us.  Waitaminute, if that&rsquo;s Y, then who was that?  And where was Y
all this time?</p>

<p>It really was a location joke!</p>

<p>Lesson with C in Akabanebashi went well today.  She&rsquo;s got great
fluency but chaotic grammar, featuring lots of instances of &ldquo;is&rdquo; in
place of a variety of verbs in a variety of tenses.</p>

<p>For example, &ldquo;lesson with C is good today.  She is fluency and bad
grammar is lots of is to any verb any time.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.krimms.com/download/rollerdog.pdf">Rollerdog</a> is a book
designed for little people growing up in the brave new world (order)
of the 21st century. Rather than instilling fear in young minds, the
storyline about Humphry the Rollerdog creates an image of hope.
However, the pictures which are crafted for deeper interpretation by
adult readers, compose a message of warning&hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m writing this from my MBP.  The Dell crawled to molasses speed
after a bit, and I&rsquo;m still optimistic that I won&rsquo;t have to powercycle
it.  It&rsquo;s still a bit responsive, so I just want to close some
programs and see if I can get it working again without shutting it
down completely.</p>

<h2 id="12-50">12:50</h2>

<p>The Dell is responding again, but I didn&rsquo;t need to merge anything in
git; I pushed from local MBP and then pulled, committed, and pushed on
Dell and now pulled on MBP, so I&rsquo;m back to 95% thinking I&rsquo;ll have to
merge somewhere in the near future.  Somewhere?  sometime?</p>

<p>On my old computer, I did something like right-click - show this box
in Finder.  The box is in its own folder so I just copied that entire
folder over the network to my debian box overnight.  Took about 6
hours as it&rsquo;s maybe 38GB (more than 10% of my previously planned HD
partition, and nearly than 40% of my previously-planned-to-purchase HD
size!)</p>

<p>In virtualbox on the new machine, I clicked File -&gt; Import Appliance,
but that did <em>not</em> work because I hadn&rsquo;t exported it from the old
computer.</p>

<p>So, in virtualbox on the new computer, I clicked Machine -&gt; Add, which
features shortcut key Ctrl-A, and navigated to the folder and opened
the .vbox file.</p>

<p>Opened with no problem, but when I tried to power it on, I got an
error:</p>

<pre><code>Could not start the machine *NAME* because the following physical
network interfaces were not found:
</code></pre>

<p>I have the option to Copy, Close VM, or Change Network Settings.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t really want a second copy of this VM, so I&rsquo;m just going to
Change Network Settings.</p>

<hr />

<p>Welp, looks like I have to create the network adapter first.  Closed
the VM and clicked File -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Network</p>

<p>then Host-only Networks tab and clicked the little plus icon to create
a new one.</p>

<p>It automagically created vboxnet0, which I think is the same name as I
didn&rsquo;t type above.</p>

<p>Clicked OK and then address two other issues I noted: This VM is
requesting more resources than this machine has!</p>

<p>Right clicked on the VM and selected settings, then tweaked some
sliders so they were in the green instead of red zones.  Wow this is
so easy!</p>

<h2 id="12-16">12:16</h2>

<p>Clicked start.</p>

<h2 id="12-20">12:20</h2>

<p>It seems to have started okay.  Now I need to see if I can get it to
serve web pages.  Hafta add to my local <code>/etc/hosts</code> file.</p>

<h2 id="12-58">12:58</h2>

<p>Boom.  I just added the entries to my local hosts file and the site
loaded perfectly.  Noice!</p>

<p>Next, I&rsquo;ll start copying the AB site to Dell machine, and while that&rsquo;s
running, get back to my more-neglected-than-usual inbox.</p>

<p>HAahah (*) tell you in a second</p>

<p>&ldquo;Debian seems fine,&rdquo; I told Travis via email, because it does.  The
<em>computer</em> is a bit slow, but that&rsquo;s not Debian&rsquo;s fault.  It&rsquo;s my
fault for using old hardware.</p>

<p>After turning on filesharing from my old machine, I successfully
copied the virtualbox box for CB to this machine, but haven&rsquo;t got it
started because the network adapter settings are different on this
hardware.</p>

<p>I decided to document what I had to do to get it working, and so
therefore needed to get my journal entries from bitbucket, and so
therefore needed to give this computer permission to access my
bitbucket account, and so therefore needed to create an ssh key, and
so therefore needed to look up how to do that.  Did the clone command
and it was like &ldquo;hey man that&rsquo;s an unknown host,&rdquo; and therefore had to
dig around to find the fingerprint online, and did <em>not</em> find a
canonical answer to what it should be, but found a reference to it in
a forum somewhere.</p>

<p>I realized I need to be careful to keep posting to the repo from both
machines, and guessed there&rsquo;s about a 90, nah, 85, nah who am I
kidding, 95% chance I&rsquo;ll forget and have to do a merge.  At least it
will be an interestingly easy way to see when I started the switch
from Mac to linux.</p>

<p>Cloned the repo, spun up emacs, and decided to use yesterday&rsquo;s entry
as a template for today&rsquo;s entry, as I haven&rsquo;t copied over my <code>.emacs</code>
file from the old machine.  It features handy keystrokes for creating
entry templates.. but for now screwit; I just need to slap down
<em>something</em> so I can get back to work and document getting the
virtualbox box back to working so I can get back to work on updating
the CB site before I have to go to work to teach two lessons near
Kawasaki station at 3pm.</p>

<p>(*) I laughed because after I opened the copy of yesterday&rsquo;s entry to
create today&rsquo;s entry, I realized the repo does <em>not</em> contain all the
changes I made yesterday on my MBP.  Yep.  gonna be some merges; 100%
sure!</p>
