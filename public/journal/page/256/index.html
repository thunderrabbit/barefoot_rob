<p><strong>6:08pm Wednesday 20 March 2013</strong></p>

<p>I submitted <a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/meiso-gambare">瞑想頑張れ</a> a few days ago.   It&rsquo;s not approved yet, but I&rsquo;m going to add on some bits, right after I go through <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/5138/beginning-storyboards-in-ios-5-part-1">Beginning Storyboards tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>hmmmmmm I just added the time above, and realize I would like a way to paste the current time + day + date like I did in my previous journal entries.   With wordpress, I only have the date in the metadata, not in the entries themselves.   Maybe a little clock widget on the new-post page will do it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to resist searching for that now until I go through the tutorial, at least.</p>

<p><strong>12:18am Thursday 21 March 2013</strong></p>

<p>moe joe I wasn&rsquo;t able to get the prep time working on the timer yet.  I was able to add a second view controller which returns the requested time, but I haven&rsquo;t been smart enough to get that time into the pre-meditation time timer.</p>

<p>Thanks to Matt&rsquo;s suggestion of making the object instantiations look like a tree, I&rsquo;ve got 楽しい発音 working without any pesky crashes caused by my confoozed way of using blocks.  Today I actually added some functionality that was not in the previous version: now I can display sets of words instead of just all the words.  Word.</p>

<p>Lin and I watched <a href="https://www.jinni.com/movies/youve-got-mail/">You&rsquo;ve Got Mail</a>, which I had never previously seen.  Meg Ryan&rsquo;s character reminded me a lot of Wende, both because she reminded me of Wende and because Wende likes Meg Ryan.</p>

<p>I rated the movie as &ldquo;great&rdquo; on <a href="https://www.jinni.com/">Jinni, my favorite movie rating site</a>, though I have typed jenni.com many times when searching for it.</p>

<p>Standing in the 2nd floor of the Shibuya Apple Store, with my phone charging on a display computer, I created an icon for 瞑想頑張れ and submitted the app to Apple for approval.  Whoohoooo!</p>

<p>The icon looks something like this:</p>

<p><a href="/images/2013/03/icon800.png"><img src="/images/2013/03/icon800.png" alt="icon800" /></a></p>

<p>I know I dropped the れ, but I hope I used the right kanji!!!</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a link to the <a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/meiso-gambare/tree/c6214f2ba1dcd10223adfd226a63049f66169ac3">姪御頑張れ commit I first submitted to Apple</a>.</p>

<p>My crappy code featuring blocks was too convoluted for my brain to figure out how to make it all work, so now the project features a nice tree of classes with a ViewController at the top.</p>

<p>The Game class and GameView class don&rsquo;t even know the other exists.  Everything goes through the ViewController.  GameView has an array of CardViews.  Game has an array of Cards.   The CardViews and Cards do not know the others exist.</p>

<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve got that sorted, it&rsquo;s much easier in my mind to figure out what&rsquo;s next.  So far, at least.</p>

<p>I just need to add a game over image and I could fuckitship.it, but I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll polish it up a lot more.</p>

                        <p>##23:11 Monday 11 March 2013</p>

<p>This weekend I mostly put together what I&rsquo;m calling the <a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/meiso-gambare">瞑想頑張れ meditation timer</a>, which is a bit like referring to &ldquo;ATM machines&rdquo; but hey at least it&rsquo;s two different languages.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s now available on github: <a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/meiso-gambare">瞑想頑張れ</a> at <a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/meiso-gambare">https://github.com/thunderrabbit/meiso-gambare</a>.</p>

<p>There are several meditation timers on the app store, but I hadn&rsquo;t found one with the unique feature I wanted.</p>

<p>Sometimes when I meditate, I really get into it and don&rsquo;t want to stop when the original time is up.  And I would like to know how much longer I remained in meditation.  It&rsquo;s possible to reset the timer, but that pretty much breaks the meditative state for me.</p>

<p>So, <a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/meiso-gambare">瞑想頑張れ meditation timer</a> counts down the predetermined time, &hellip; and then counts up until I click stop.  Simple.</p>

<p>The name comes from two words in Japanese that probably don&rsquo;t fit well together, but they work for me.  瞑想 can be transliterated as &ldquo;meiso,&rdquo; and means meditation.  頑張れ can be transliterated as &ldquo;gambare&rdquo; and means something like &ldquo;do one&rsquo;s best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, I hope it proves useful to me and others!</p>

<p>瞑想頑張れ is not yet available in the app store, but I hope to submit it within maybe a month.  Gotta get it polished a bit, plus put some icons on it.  I might strip out the FB stuff for the first version if I can&rsquo;t get it working soon.</p>

<p>I miss DJing; that was so much fun.   I just enjoyed communicating with Tom at KTRU during his Saturday midnight shift.  He played a song for me, which was awesome, though I didn&rsquo;t know it was for me until he mentioned it hahahaha.</p>

                        <p>##10:17 Saturday 02 March 2013</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve misplaced my template for writing States of My Life Addresses.</p>

<p>Work has been my main focus for a while; Mondays through Fridays I wake up usually at 7:30am, do a backup of the AB database, leave for work at 8; arrive at work at 9,  eat my lunch that Lin made, work + read hacker news, buy a drink and snack around 4pm, leave at 6pm, meet Lin at Shinagawa station or at home, eat dinner, hang out, shower, sleep.</p>

<p>Variants of the M-F schedule include mediation in the morning, recently for 30 minutes.  I am &ldquo;soon&rdquo; going to make a simple app to be a meditation timer.  I have a name selected, but haven&rsquo;t secured it with Apple (did you know that all the apps in the Apple App Store have distinct names?) and I don&rsquo;t want the hordes of people who read my journal to hoard my good name idea.   haha anyway, I plan to make the app source code available on github, my first open source project of any magnitude.  But yes, for now it&rsquo;s vaporware.   (And yes, I know there are many meditation timers, but none of <em>the</em> feature that I want.)</p>

<p>Lin and I have been married for, um,.. a year and a half.  It&rsquo;s a bit confusing to me because our official marriage date of 4 July 2011 differs from  30 December 2011, our wedding date in Houston, by nearly 6 months, plus I have to do some thinkin&rsquo; to figure out the year, etc etc..  So we&rsquo;ve been married for a bit, and are still in the honeymoon stage of lovey dovey, ooey gooey, kissey kissy, happy sappy relationship, which I&rsquo;m quite enjoying.</p>

<p>We have our fair share of fights when I&rsquo;m an asshole, complaining about what she does, and, fortunately, she&rsquo;ll tell me straight up, &ldquo;yo!&rdquo; and we get it sorted pretty quickly.  I&rsquo;m certain that ability to get the shit out will continue to benefit us.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve got a long-term plan to move to Taiwan, &ldquo;in 3 years,&rdquo; but no real date set.  Lin&rsquo;s mom is welcome to join, but appears that she will choose to stay close to her existing grandkids.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s crappy cold today.  Living up on the 13th floor, overlooking a relatively wide plain including a river and nothing much to hinder the wind, we can hear the whissing sound in the window, sometimes continuously.   My weather data says it&rsquo;s 8C now in Tokyo.   Wednesday and Thursday were a bit warmer than other recent days.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also been working with Tariq on our next app, and recently got some advice from Matt who has organized the iOS meetups in Tokyo for the past long while.  Matt suggested replacing the ivars with properties, and I was like, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s an ivar?&rdquo; and I forgot what it stands for, but it means the variables declared inside the private implementation instead of the private interface.   (I think I have used many of the correct words here)</p>

<p>The app works on my devices, and on my simulators, but crashes on Tariq&rsquo;s iPad mini, but I haven&rsquo;t figured out why.  We think it might be his device; it can&rsquo;t play some other games, so we&rsquo;re going to continue development with the hope/belief that it will all be okay for the vast majority of iDevices.</p>

<p>At work, the app we made for a client was rejected because it gives &ldquo;discounts to physical goods or services,&rdquo; which it&rsquo;s been doing for years.  Now suddenly they reject it for that reason.  I&rsquo;ve been getting less and less impressed with Apple to the point that I&rsquo;ve stated that I&rsquo;ve purchased my last Apple device.  My plan is to put linux on this iMac when it&rsquo;s no longer strong enough to support the latest OS X in a couple years.  Then once this computer bites the big one, I&rsquo;ll buy a Chromebook or something.   We&rsquo;ll see how long this plan lasts.</p>

<p>So it&rsquo;s because &ldquo;not much is happening&rdquo; that I haven&rsquo;t really been writing in my journal.  It&rsquo;s just the same old boring stuff day after day.  I&rsquo;ve considered removing &ldquo;Keep Pushing The Limits&rdquo; from my journal; I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve kept pushing the limits at all.</p>

<p>Welllll as I write this, I remember my same old boring daily routine does <em>not</em> include wearing shoes; I&rsquo;m approaching my 1 year anniversary of being barefoot in Japan, and it looks like I&rsquo;ve made it through the winter, being shod only on the days that it snowed, or when it was less than ~5C and rainy.</p>

<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve been unsubscribing from almost every email list I&rsquo;ve been on over the years.  I stopped reading them, so am stopping subscriptions.  That&rsquo;s my first step in taking control of my inbox again.  There are now 307 unread messages, and 963 messages in my inbox.</p>

<p>breakfast time! whoooo  cornbread is done!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a Saturday as I write this, and it happens to be a lazy Saturday as we&rsquo;ve got nothing planned, per se.  Lin is making cornbread, and I just watched the first episode where Nibbler turns out to be smart.  Interestingly, given that the characters don&rsquo;t remember the happenings of the episode, I don&rsquo;t remember ever having seen this episode before, though I had seen the one before it.</p>

<p>This is the second time that Lin has made cornbread; the first time was about a week ago, and quite yummy!</p>

<p>I think I shall write a state of my life address, my first in a while.</p>
