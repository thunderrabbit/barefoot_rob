<p>Ria (pronounced lee-ah) is a cute Japanese girl that I met tonight
in ASL class.  She's been in the US for 11 months, and knows English
relatively well.  I've been in Japan for 0 months, and know almost
diddly about Japanese, but we are likely to meet up and tutor each
other in our respective languages!</p>

<p>We talked a bit after ASL and traded phone numbers.  We both have
cell phones with Cingular, and our rates go down after 9pm.  How
amazing is that?</p>

<p>I'm just so thrilled to have met someone with whom I can trade
language learning services like this.  So perfect!  I'll bring my
books <em>Japanese for Busy People</em> and she can teach me how to
pronounce the characters.  That's where I imagine I'll start.  I don't
have a rush rush need to learn Japanese quickly, so I can learn it
slowly and correctly.</p>

<p>French, however, I feel a bit of a rush to learn, since we're going
in March, so I'm taking classes for the next 8 mondays!</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I'm here at work now, and I've just got one (1) thing on my list to
do.  I hope to knock it out in an hour or so.</p>

<p>It's 9:08pm now.</p>

<p class=date>It's 10:45, and I didn't quite finish, but I know at
least what datastep is causing the problem.  I tried a few ways to fix
it, but just made a mess of my (test) dataset.  Going home to bed now.</p>

<p><b>Special Seminar</b></p>

<p><b>11:00 am, Thursday, 2/22, 200-203 (Note - this is on the far corner of
the main quad)</b></p>

<p><b>Thermal Engineering at Extreme Scales</b></p>

<p>Samuel S. Mao
<br>Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</p>

<p><b>ABSTRACT</b></p>

<p>Research in science and technology at small length and time scales is
taking place in a growing number of laboratories throughout the world. New
phenomena that manifest themselves at the nanometer scale will dominate the
operation of miniaturized devices that may revolutionize information and
biological technologies. New processing and probing approaches based on
ultrafast laser technology will facilitate efficient fabrication and
diagnostics in the small dimensions. Despite substantial progress in
understanding laser processing of electronic materials, in particular, at
the nanosecond and longer time scales, it remains a considerable challenge
to elucidate the underlying mechanisms for picosecond laser-material
interactions. In this seminar, recent experimental and theoretical
developments on picosecond laser ablation will be discussed. Picosecond
time-resolved process diagnostics will be presented along with the
observation of a short-lifetime, microscale plasma that is responsible for
an unexpected reduction of ultrafast laser ablation efficiency. A theory is
also developed for picosecond energy transport in semiconductors. In
addition to ultrafast laser engineering, this seminar will provide an
overview of the research that the author has been carrying out in the field
of nanotechnology. These activities include development of patterned
nanowire systems for photonic applications; thermal modeling of
nano-structured surface-emitting semiconductor lasers; experimental
investigations of interface properties of nanoscale particles; and fluid
dynamics in two-dimensional molecular films.</p>

HAC YAC meeting I decided to revisit the place where 
my bike got TOTALLY mud bogged so that I couldn't ride it.</p>

<p>Basically I had to get off at the telephone pole, and drag/carry my bike to where the freeway 
ramp up becomes an "overpass" bridge thing.</p>

<p>Crazy!</p>

<p>On Sunday after HAC YAC meeting, where we finalized plans for
Houston Rally, (which is <em>this weekend!!!!!</em>) I visited Paint
This! and brought Spot so he would get some fresh air and new
experiences instead of just being a lazy indoor cat:</p>

<p><a href='/images/cats/spot_12jan2002.jpg'><img src='/images/cats/thumbs/spot_12jan2002.jpg'></a></p>

<p>He was great on the way there in the car.  No crying or anything.
When we arrived he was all claws in my shoulder at first, but then
chilled and snooped around the shop.  After about an hour or so, he
vanished.</p>

<p>We found him sitting sneakily under a table on some boxes.</p>

<p>I'm glad he had a fun time.</p>

<p>After tape listening, I took recycling to the recycling center (on
my bicycle, the ultimate in environmentalism), and picked up a dremel
bit from Jennifer at Paint This!  Very excited about that because I
need it to finish the current part of my marble track.  I have some
tracks running too closely together, so I need to gently buzz away
some wood so marbles will fit through.  This is up in the right hand
staircase, on its second level, where it goes right past where the
little marble rolls around the outside edge of a tongue depressor.</p>

<p>I took a picture of 4 flags reflecting off a glass building.
Hopefully it will look pretty cool.  Oh, and I got rechargable
batteries for Shot(*) via UPS today.</p>

<p>Now I'm at work, and I have just sent my notes from the investment
club meeting to secretary/former president Charyl for record-keeping
and feedback.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Excited that we had two different house showings today!  Wheee!</p>

<p>(*) looks like this name for my digital camera might stick.  Sure
is shorter than writing "my digital camera."</p>

<p>Today I cleaned up my apartment, hung some pictures (one of Wende
at the Cullen Fountain, with her shoes floating away on my frisbee,
another that my grandmother painted in 1974, a postcard from Costa
Rica, and an autumn leaf that Joana mailed me from Kalamazoo), swept
the floor, and listened to a blank tape to verify that it was, in
fact, blank.</p>

<p>I listened to another tape that I recorded at KTRU on 13 May 1999
and 15 May 1999.  But the weird thing is that I only recorded my
voice, putting the tape on pause whenever I played music.  Entirely
disruptive to the tape-listening experience... or it is if I'm
listening to the tape while in the mindset of listening to the
radio.</p>

<p>The tape still has a significant amount of space on it, so I'm
going to record my show tonight (that part which isn't the basketball
game) to fill up the rest of the tape.</p>

<p>The funniest thing about the old recording on the tape is that it
starts with me doing a Legal ID at 4am, and I can tell I was <em>so
tired</em> while on the air.  Pretty funny.  Other than that, I wonder
if I'll be able to tell a big difference in my styles.</p>

<p>Oh, the coolest thing about finding the tape is that it proves when
I started DJing at KTRU.  Spring of 1999.  I had pretty much lost
track of that.  So I've been a DJ now for 3 years.</p>

<p>Today I have officially finished the big project that ended up in
crunch mode over the past few days.  The culmination was moving the
project from our test machine to our live web servers.  Thing is, it's
been running on the test machine during the pilot, whereas normally we
would run a pilot on the live servers.  But whatever; it's moved over
now.</p>

<p>But even better than that, I just finished a significant long
conversation with Karla, which I started by owning up that I should be
able to manage my own projects and not make her handle all the
details.  I know the company doesn't benefit from having the president
of the company handle the micro-est scale.</p>

<p>Anyway, we got all that out and the conversation slowly shifted to
larger scale real world stuff including death, cancer, guardian
angels, life after death, remote viewing the year 3000.  We didn't get
to UFO's, but that would have been next on my list.</p>

<p>I'm feeling a ton happier and better about myself and work and
everything now that all that is out (and the project is finished).  I
feel like I'm on summer break compared to the beginning of the week.</p>

<p>Oh, I still gotta do investment club stuff.</p>

<p>I've slacked long enough.  Gotta finish this project for Dow
tonight.  I handled a customer service type call earlier and went
boasting into Karla's office, "I hate customer service, but I'm a
genius at it!"  She agreed I am great with the customers and asked
what genius I did for them, etc.  Then she said she hates being
project manager but she still does it.  Erg.  Fuck.  Durn tootin'
she's right.  I have not project managed my own projects because I
just hate it.  She enables me to not do it; I don't know if I'd
survive working here if I had to project manage.  At the same time,
Karla shouldn't have to put up with my bullshit of not getting all the
shit done and having to ask her multiple times for specs.</p>

<p>I felt guilty as shit, and I know she didn't mean it that way.</p>

<p>It's 7:09PM.  I've just been at home and back (second time I went
home today.  First time I came here I brought my canvas and everyone
enjoyed it.  I loved all the different things people saw, including a
dragon, a tornado, a chicken, a whale.  Just like cloud shapes.</p>

<p>Then I left and came back riding my unicycle.  Nice.</p>

<p>Then I left for a bit and talked to the guys pouring cement and I
got to write my name in it with a nail.  ("ROB! 8 JAN 2002")
Awesome.</p>

<p>Then I just went back home) to trade my unicycle in for my bike.</p>

<p>So now I'm shall embark on a NIN din as I code this sucker.</p>

<p class=date>7:39pm</p>

<p>Aw fuck.  I didn't remember I still have to design a user interface
and code that.</p>

<p>Fuck fuck fuck.</p>

<p class=date>8:59pm</p>

<p>Uh oh.  This is looking bad.  My mind is beginning to stray.  The
din finished.</p>

<p class=date>9:55pm</p>

<p>Things are looking okay-ish, I think.  I'm able to tell if I need
to convert someone to a participant, or if they are already a
participant.  Still need to save the data and check for errors though.
There is more to do, I think, but I can't think of it right now.</p>

<p>I'm heating some soup.</p>

<p>I'm eating some soup.</p>

<p>Mmmm good soup.</p>

<p class=date>11:44pm</p>

<p>Soup is long gone.  My brain may be with it.</p>

<p>I have begun testing this screen on two different projects at the
same time.  I had hardcoded some values that should not have been, and
this testing revealed those.  The data is being saved partially.</p>

<p>Right now the issue is knowing how to update the participant
information.  This is dependent on if the person is already a
participant, and if the admin is just changing the class_number XOR
survey_type or class_number AND survey_type.<p>

<p class=date>4:01am Wednesday 9 January 2002</p>

<p>I just took a four hour nap.  Little bit groggy, throat and sinuses
so dry.  I'm thankful that Karla negotiated an extension for us
(me).</p>

<p class=date>4:06am</p>

<p>Oh yes; brain is much more alert.  I GGP though.</p>

<p class=date>6:51am</p>

<p>Tired-ish again, but I've gotten most of the user interface
written.  The AND / XOR problem is solved with it.</p>

<p>There's a strange glow on the eastern horizon.</p>

<p>Hungry.  More soup.  :-)</p>

<p class=date>10:49am</p>

<p>I'm back in the nin din mode <em>the fragile: right</em>.  I've
worked some, went home and showered, went to Wende's to get a trunk
off a tall shelf and show her investment club stuff.</p>

<p>Got back to work and handled a CSR thing and fixed some questions
in a dataset.  I don't know if the specs were changed or what.</p>

<p class=date>1:10pm</p>

<p>I just went home and took a 30 minute nap.  Got back and our system
is off.  The electrical circuit controlling <em>all</em> our servers
is dee ee ay dee dead.</p>

<p>Kevin went to purchase extension cords.  I don't know where Karla
is.</p>

<p>Ironies:</p>

<p>1) The individual workstations are up and running fine.</p>

<p>2) I had just recently asked that we invite an electrician in to
make sure we weren't overloading stuff.</p>

<p>3) We had an electrician in and he said we were not.</p>

<p>Ass:</p>

<p>Dennis just recently (after the fact) said loudly, "I knew that we
were overloading them; I knew that electrician was wrong!"</p>

<p>Fuckin fuck you Dennis and shut up.  If you knew it, why didn't you
say it?  Why even <em>consider</em> bragging about it, cause it makes
you look like a liar, or intentionally withholding important information.</p>

<p class=date>1:15pm</p>

<p>I just heard the radio crackle of a building maintenance guy.</p>

<p>oh shit Karla just got in. Does she know?  She didn't know.</p>

<p class=date>5:24pm</p>

<p>So the power outage wasn't so horrible; my machine never lost
power.  I'm pretty close to finished with this crunch.  I'm going to
go to bed for a few hours and come back around 9 or 10pm.</p>

<p class=date>9:45pm</p>

<p>Back to work.</p>

<p class=date>11:59pm Wednesday 9 January 2002</p>

<p>I think I've finished the coding for promoting participants to the
next level.  Just doing some testing on it and it appears all good.</p>

<p class=date>1:47am Thursday 10 January 2002</p>

<p>Oops.  It was not all good, but now it's all good.  I have just
checked off item 1 from my list of 5 items to do tonight.  Hopefully
the rest will go a lot faster than 4 hours each.  :-)</p>

<p class=date>3:42am</p>

<p>Just finished and tested item 2 of 5.</p>

<p>That's all for coding.  The next three steps are related to moving
the code and datasets online.</p>

<p class=date>3:54am</p>

<p>Step 3 of 5 is finished. (compare supporting datasets between my
test machine and the live staging machine)</p>

<p class=date>4:16am</p>

<p>Step 4 of 5 is finished: move new G3 source code online.  (there
were only 2 new macros.)</p>

<p class=date>5:51am</p>

<p>Frickin' frack, it's not working.  I moved the macros and datasets
online, carefully making sure all their parts were in working order.
But there's something else not working.  I have a guess as to what it
is.</p>

<p>During this time I have also been bouncing emails with a woman in
Europe, helping her get her feedback entered.</p>

<p>I'm hungry again.</p>

<p class=date>6:41am</p>

<p>I have not been able to resolve the problem moving stuff online.  I
have emailed a help-request to Kevin, and emailed our client that it's
going to be a bit later than AAM.  Kevin usually gets in around 10am.
That's when I'll come back.  Bedtime now.</p>

<p class=date>10:10am</p>

<p>Back at work.  Kevin's not here yet.  My brain remembers how to fix
one of the errors I was seeing.</p>

<p class=date>10:50am</p>

<p>Fixed!!!!</p>

<p>I had forgotten to move online a macro called "nothing"</p>

<pre>
%macro nothing;
%mend;
</pre>

<p>This macro is critical to the operation of this project.  It allows
pointers to macros point to it thereby removing their functionality.
The macro is called and nothing happens, just as required.</p>

<p class=date>11:11am</p>

<p>I've tested all the functionality and it all works.  I'm closing
this journal entry now.</p>

<p>Yay for finishing this project!</p>

<p>I talked to one of the friendliest, most knowledgeable construction
guys out on 59 today.  I actually didn't say HI to him first.  He
approached me after I had been standing watching them create the
frame/mold/form/plywood where a new curb will be.</p>

<p>He spoke as if he was an owner in the company that has been on this
project, using the pronoun "we" a lot to describe what they have been
doing and will do later.</p>

<p>He confirmed a rumor that once they are done with this part, 59
will be lowered beneath Montrose and Richmond.  Holy shit wow.  That
project sounds enormous and incredible to me.</p>

<p>They are going to make two bridges for Montrose, stopping each side
independently; otherwise, they'd have to completely shut down
Montrose, which would be completely unacceptable to many many
residents.</p>

<p>I'm pleased to have this heads-up advanced warning.  He said the
project will likely start this summer.  He's hoping that his company
will get the bid.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I told him about riding my bicycle through the mud yesterday, and
that I crawled through the tube last summer.</p>

<p>"Lemme just ask you... why?" about the tube.</p>

<p>"Cause it was there.  It was my one and only chance to do it.  I
had to."</p>

<p>He seemed to understand.  :-)</p>
