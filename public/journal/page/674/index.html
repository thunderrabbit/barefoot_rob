                        <p class=date>Friday 7 November 1997</p>

<p><p>
Today I am sick as crap and I&rsquo;m home from work. I just slept 4 hours and it&rsquo;s about 4pm.  I&rsquo;m writing because I just had an awesomely detailed and useable dream.
<p>
I was at work and we had some kind of meeting to evalutate how we felt about our jobs and such.  No one could find my evaluation, so I just straight told them.
<p>
&ldquo;I hate this job and what I really want to be doing is working with youth.&rdquo;
<p>
Kate looked quite seriously at me, &ldquo;what do you mean?&rdquo;
<p>
&ldquo;All this corprate bullshit I totally hate and I want to get out of here.&rdquo;
<p>
She told me what a true friend would say, &ldquo;Well, if that&rsquo;s what you want then totally go for it!&rdquo;  She leveled with me, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got about 8 more weeks of difficult work ahead of us, and after that time, I can see no problem whatsoever with you leaving.&rdquo;
<p>
My other coworkers were just as helpful and supportive, suggesting places I could live or go to school to get a Master&rsquo;s in Education or something.
<p>
Hmmm.
<p>
At that point the dream started to get wacky and we were looking at pictures of people in a magazine and saying &ldquo;I hate you,&rdquo; which I interpret as &ldquo;I take all my stresses out on the world when it&rsquo;s due simply to my lifestyle which I hate.&rdquo;
<p>
I woke up soon thereafter and pondered the dream.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
I am now remembering that as I woke up this morning, I had another dream, one that I was working as a camp counselor for elementary and junior high aged youth.
<p>
I currently shudder at the thought of any kind of instruction toward that age group, but the counselor idea doesn&rsquo;t seem too far off base.
<p>
Hmmmm.
<p></p>

                        <p class=date>Wednesday 5 November 1997</p>

<p><p>
Yesterday I got a call from Matt about the New Warrior Training weekend I&rsquo;ll attend November 14-16. He was all, &ldquo;did you have any plans for how to get there?&rdquo;  I told him I was just gonna go with my dad, who is attending as staff.  He said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not going with your dad.&rdquo;  That settled that.
<p>
He gave me the phone numbers of two men who live in my area: Don and Fred, and asked if I would take responsibility for calling them and arranging rides.  No problem, I said.
<p>
&ldquo;New Warrior Training?&rdquo; you ask.  &ldquo;What the hell is that?&rdquo;
<p>
Well, I don&rsquo;t entirely know, but I have an idea that this weekend is designed to help men get in touch with their emotional nature and to dig way back into their brains and dig up a lot of repressed crap from childhood and growing up and life in general so this crap can be examined and processed as necessary.
<p>
Hmmm.
<p>
Sounds refreshing, scary, liberating, and crazy.  Probably so.
<br>
I&rsquo;ll be certain to let you know how it goes.

                        <h1>1997 San Antonio rally review by Rob</h1>

<hr>

<p><p>
The slugless San Antonio Rally, 31 October - 2 November 1997 was a most entirely excellent rally.
<p>
Special guests Drake Baer and Gregor Faron were flown in from Metro New York District to attend as normal advisor and youth, as part of a &ldquo;district exchange&rdquo; program to encourage communication in YRUU between the districts.
<p>
The first night was normal high energy rally bounciness, with PHUUFs for some of the rally virgins, toe tags to identify touch group affiliation, Surge, chocolate, mugbook picture taking and everything else that starts a rally.
<p>
After most everyone had arrived, Arlene and I got to lead the rally virgin meeting, which we did just before the main opening circle.  Given the number of PHUUFs that had been given, the new youths were a bit nervous about what we planned.  (Fact is, nothing was planned; we led the meeting ad lib fashion)  We assured them they had nothing to worry about.  I started by simply describing the indescribable value of the community, and how it all works just with the Big Four rules.  We empowered them to say NO if they were uncomfortable, and to simply have a great time at the rally.  I think it went rather well.
<p>
After the main opening circle, we just played and did whatever until like 3am I think I went to bed.  Maybe 3:30.
<p>
The next morning, we had pancakes and cereal for breakfast.  Yay!<br />
<p>
The morning workshop I attended was Q&amp;A with Drake and Greg.<br> They asked us to present any problems we see with YRUU programming at a district or local level.  We did so and during the workshop, we basically compiled all the problems and broke into groups and solved each of them.  Amazing!  We felt the workshop was so successful and worthwhile that Drake offered to transcribe our work and email it out.  I will put it on our webpage when I receive it.
<p>
The afternoon workshop was tarot card reading.  There was no organization to the workshop, but people got out all their cards and did readings for one another.  I brought my Runes and did about 6 readings for people.  Pretty much everyone was quite impressed with the appropriateness of the Rune readings.
<p>
During the day I drummed with Austin R on Jon W&rsquo;s drums.  We jammed for about 15 minutes outside in the yummy sunshine.  We attracted a small crowd, including Jon who clapped at the end; I got warm fuzzies from that.
<p>
I also got to play with Stacy&rsquo;s diablo, a spinning yo yo thing that she often brings to rallies.
<p>
My personally coolest moment of the weekend occurred in the 20 minutes before the worship service.  I lay down to take a nap and my brain was so excitedly awake, while my body was so tired, that my body instantly fell asleep and my brain stayed awake. Cool. I love that state of consciousness.<br>
I tried something I&rsquo;ve been wanting to do for a while: to simply move my etheric body out of my physical body. I focused gently on my arm, trying to raise my etheric arm without moving my physical arm.  As usual, it wasn&rsquo;t working.  Then something tinked my memory about visualizing what I want. (My brain said, &ldquo;visualize what you want.&rdquo;)  Oh yeah- I had forgotten.  Thanks, brain!
<p>
So I visualized myself standing in the room.  Instantly, my body began the tingling, oscillating, spinning feeling that I&rsquo;ve associated with out of body experiences!
<p>
&ldquo;Oh this is cool!&rdquo; and &ldquo;remain calm&rdquo; went through my mind.
<p>
I set up a quick protection field around me just in case anything wacky might happen otherwise.
<p>
I visualized exactly what the room should look like, and I kept feeling the tingling oscillating, but never got much past that. I was too excited to let the process happen.
Soon Wende walked in to wake me up for the worship.  I told her with as much excitement as my sleepy physical body could muster about my experience.  Wow.
<p>
The worship was a pagan ritual celebrating the day of the dead, when the veil between the world of the living and the world of the dead is most thin.  Nice worship, but it didn&rsquo;t result in emotionally charged sniffles and tears around the room as most youth-designed worships do.
<p>
Soon thereafter, I greatly encouraged Tia to begin the YAC meeting; I didn&rsquo;t want to be up all night meeting, and I especially didn&rsquo;t want to deal with the possibility of us not getting the YAC stuff done this weekend. <br>
We met and invited anyone who was interested to join.  A bowl of toasted pumpkin seeds was a salty welcome addition to the meeting.<br>
The main thing we determined was when to have elections for YAC members.  We planned to elect 2 youth that night, 3 in Houston, and 3 youth and 1 adult in Oklahoma City.
<p>
During the YAC meeting, a group played Silent Football!  Without me!!  Oh, the things I do for YAC&hellip;.
<p>
At around midnight or 1am, the talent show was one of the funniest I&rsquo;ve attended ever. Kriscott and Aaron did a guitar duet, which was excellent of course.  Jennifer and Dane did a poorly lip-synched Japanese fighting movie, <em>San Antonio Saki</em> with Kris and me doing their voices.  That was so hilarious since it was totally ad-libbed.. Kris and I were just making up threats and curses and craziness
<p>
&ldquo;Your mother is a side of beef&rdquo;  <br>
&ldquo;I have attacked great lizard and killed it with one blow from my psycho fist punch&rdquo; <br>
&ldquo;Ouch!  You have broken my leg!&rdquo;
<p>
Ya had to be there&hellip;
<p>
It turned out way funnier than I had expected; certainly the lateness of the hour magnified the funniness factor.
<p>
Steve F played &ldquo;Rocky Raccoon&rdquo; on guitar, a YRUU favorite.
<p>
Shawn (sp), a graduated YRUUer played guitar &ldquo;Dead Puppies&rdquo; and a capella &ldquo;If I ever fall in love again&rdquo; and something on piano.
<p>
Kimmi played something on piano which just grabbed the emotions and anticipations I loved it.
<p>
Some of the newer youth heard I could tell The Clown Joke, but more youth were like, &ldquo;no! no! no!&rdquo; so I didn&rsquo;t.<br />
<p>
Then, much to my surprise, San Antonio Saki Part II was performed.  This time, Kris and I did the voices from our comfortable prone positions in the audience, and this time it was funnier.  It started out just as,
<p>
&ldquo;I have returned from the dead to seek revenge!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I will again put you to death with my evil fist!&rdquo;
<p>
and then Dane started to get crazy and rip off his shirt, so I was all
<p>
&ldquo;Oh yeah, mother fucker? I&rsquo;m gonna kick your fuckin ass, bitch!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Bring it on, tough guy!&rdquo;
<p>
or something like that.
<p>
I was deleriously laffin&rsquo; after that.  So nutty funny.<br />
<p>
Somewhere during the show, &ldquo;Improv Tag&rdquo; was started.  At first the scene was two ditzy preppy girls and then it turned to someone having a baby and Chris asked me to do his voice when he froze it.  So he goes &ldquo;freeze!&rdquo; and walked up there and I do the same voice I used for the San Saki Antonio, &ldquo;I have come to attack you and your family!&rdquo;  That was pretty funny.  and then it went to shit when Bryan and Shawn were looking at a huge pile of shit.  Aaron goes, &ldquo;freeze!&rdquo; and both Aaron and Scott walked up with their guitars and kicked both Bryan and Shawn offstage and began to play.  I loved it!
<p>
But even better was Chris A who froze them halfway through the song and kicked one off the stage to continue the game!
<p>
It got crazy and then everyone walked off stage, and of course people yelled &ldquo;freeze&rdquo; at the empty stage&hellip;
<p>
After a few more talents (or not) people wondered at someone placing garbage bags on the stage.  What could they be planning?  Then two six-packs of Surge appeared onstage.  From my comfortable prone position, I lept toward the stage.  I&rsquo;ll challenge anyone at a Surging contest!   Turns out that the contestants were already chosen: Aaron I and Jason F.
They started chugging; Jason with grimace on face, and Aaron with one hand on his hip, gently drinking and appeared almost to be taking his time.  After a moment, several members of the crowd rushed the stage to greedily partake of the tasty beverage under the guise of helping the competitors.  I joined, and gulped one of Aaron&rsquo;s cans.  Soon all of Aaron&rsquo;s were empty and he was announced the winner after 1 minute and 36 seconds!  Amazing!
<p>
Jason later told me that no one helped drink any of his, which I thought was surprising and actually kinda funny.
<p>
The next morning after cleanup, we had donuts and talked talked talked until we simply had to leave.  We stopped by Taco Cabana for lunch and got home around 2:30pm.  I slept until 7am the next day.</p>

                        <h1>1997 San Antonio rally review by Mike</h1>

<hr>

<p><p></p>

<p>Ok, first tera little picked me up at my house in plano at about 4 pm friday.
<p>
 Then tera and nathan sexton and i drove down to san antonio. it was kinda
bad though cuz tera&rsquo;s car doesn&rsquo;t have a clock or a radio, but we survived.
Anyway, this is a good part. right before we got to the church, we called
from the texaco station and got bryan beck on the phone. we told bryan tera
got lost in waco and somehow ended up in this small town called sealy
somewhere near houston.
<br>
So bryan ran around the church looking for a map and we drove to the church
and tapped bryan on the back, said hey bryan what up? bryan almost started
crying. it was hilarious&hellip;.
<p>
anyway, friday night we got there really early so there wasn&rsquo;t much going on
for a while. but opening circle was really good, they read a summary of what
samhain was and then everybody wrote a little samhain resolution and taped it
on the wall.
then broke into touch groups, that was fun i guess.
<p>
rest of night, nothing much happened.
<br>
Oh hold on, we watched South Park which was really good, i had never seen it
before since i dont get cable.
<p>
In the morning, had breakfast, the apple jacks were REAL good stuff.
The morning workshop I went to was the discussion with Drake Baer and Greg
Faron, the guys from Metro NY District (Princeton UU Church). This was really
good, we got to discuss a lot of the problems the Southwest District was
having and some solutions. I think it really helped me out&hellip;
<p>
Lunch was excellent, i loved that turkey.
Afternoon tarot workshop was awesome, those cards were really weird, they
predicted my life so well i was shocked!
then there was the smoking workshop, i didn&rsquo;t go, but most people who did go
said it was a lot of propaganda that they had already heard 10 million times
before, a waste of time&hellip;
<p>
Then dinner was awesome, yet again. I got deja vu looking at the dinner
table, cause it looked exactly the same as last years.
then sat. nite was really busy. The YAC meeting was interesting, my first.
 the bylaws were passed by YRUU, so the age range is increased to 20 and YAC
is going to be 8 youth and 4 adults now.
Then there were yac elections and after some confusion Maia Cudhea and Nathan
Ryan were elected.
Then the talent show&hellip;&hellip;.
<p>
that was basically the night.
in the morning, clean up and breakfast.
Very fun rally&hellip;..
<p>
Mike Moren
<p></p>

<p>PS This isn&rsquo;t really part of the rally, part of getting there, but on the way
down there i had to listen to tera sing her silly song she sang to her kid:
<p>
I&rsquo;m a Unitarian Universalist<br>
Oh Yes I am<br>
I believe in the<br>
inherent worth and dignity<br>
of every woman and man..
<p>
Ill sing the tune 4 anybody who wants&hellip;.</p>

<p><p></p>

This morning I shaved my head. Down to my bare scalp; did it myself in the shower. Quite a fun costume for Halloween.
<p>
I&rsquo;m dressed as a bald guy!
<p>
I&rsquo;m excited about the Rally <b>(tonight!)</b> in San Antonio, and the youth going, &ldquo;whoah dude! you shaved your head again!&rdquo; (I shaved it at <a href="https://www.geocities.com/heartland/2735/rob_swuusi_1997.html" target="resource window">SWUUSI</a> this past summer.)
<p>
I enjoy having my head shaved. The surprising sensation when I touch my head still pleasantly shocks my hand each time. Try it. Your hair will grow back.

This night I went to Kathy F&rsquo;s to get balanced. Specifically, she worked on my cranial-sacral balance (and I&rsquo;m still not sure how to spell it) to help get my physical body aligned.
<p>
During the process, my consciousness stayed mostly aware as my physical body took a nap. I love that state of awareness! (I still believe that state is one step away from etheric projection; I&rsquo;ll continue practicing.)
<p>
Upon completion, I paged Wende while Kathy and I talked about various excellent books we&rsquo;ve read. Wende arrived with halloween colored Oreos which we munched and generally had a yummy good time.
<p>
There&rsquo;s so much I want to read!</p>

<p><p>
This evening at Taco Cabana for our weekly LRY Dinner Hangout, Jon W was already there when we arrived. He showed off his new braces and new pager; &ldquo;what&rsquo;s different about me?&rdquo; he asked as I greeted him.
<p>
We ordered and Paul R arrived as our food appeared on the counter. I got a Suicide as my tasty beverage and we sat outside to chat and chew.
<p>
We talked Rally stuff, as this coming weekend is the San Antonio Rally, and Jon and I are working on the Houston Rally for January, and the Houston Planning Rally for next month! We had just gotten out the registration forms for the Planning Rally (&ldquo;Construct-O-Con&rdquo;) a few days previously.
<p>
Jon practiced intonations (I guess that&rsquo;s what one might call them) for his drama class: practicing articulating various vowel sounds without getting tongue tied. (say that 10 times quickly)

<p><p>
At 5:45 in the am, after we had slept about 3 or 4 hours, the lights flashed on and immediately back off as Gerald came in to set up the chairs for the day.
<p>
I popped awake and hopped up and went to talk with him.  &ldquo;Um, we spent the night here last night, can you open the LRY room so we can sleep in there instead?&rdquo;<br>
He said, &ldquo;no problem&rdquo; or something equally positive and we trudged outside to the LRY room to crash.  kT claimed the larger of the two couches, so I stole a cushion off it.  <em>Whoah!</em> it&rsquo;s a couch bed!!
<p>
So we pulled out the mattress and kT and Paul crashed on the bed.  I burrowed in between them, stating, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m making sure you guys don&rsquo;t try to get busy together.&rdquo;
<p>
We slept for a few more hours (actually Paul didn&rsquo;t sleep because the mattress was at a slant where he lay. I felt really bad about that when I found out) until people started arriving at church.
<p>
Wende and Paul got up and got donuts and orange juice for us to munch, which we did happily, chatting and acting silly.
<p>
The carnival was great fun, especially after rumors that it wouldn&rsquo;t happen. I most enjoyed
<ol>
<li>sneaking into the back door of the haunted house and scaring the boogies out of Emory and whoever else was back there. Once he regained his composure, he was all, &ldquo;hey! you can&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; but he was wearing a glowing retainer thing and it sounded like, &ldquo;hey oo an oo ah!&rdquo; Funny!</li>
<li>after a while we went back to the LRY room, dreading the clean-up process. We were so tired&hellip; But I walked over to the haunted house and people were already cleaning it up! Three adults and some of the younger kids, and I zipped back to our room.  (I don&rsquo;t feel 1 iota bad after all the effort we put into building the thing.)</li>
</ol>
<p>
Wende&rsquo;s truck, Bill, had a flattening tire, so we got it fixed on the way home.

                        <p class=date>Saturday 25 October 1997</p>

<p><p>
This day the LRY helped the Schweitzer Club with building their haunted house for the younger kids at church! Normally this project belongs to the Schweitzer Club, but they have only a few members this year and asked for our help.
<p>
My task included bringing big boxes for building whatever they wanted to build. Wende had brought a large box from work a few days previously, which stood grandly in our living room until Saturday morning.<br>
In the past, we&rsquo;ve been able to find tons of boxes at her work, but not this day. Almost all the boxes were smushed and bailed for recycling.  Doh!! There were a couple of long panels of cardboard, so we grabbed those. We also grabbed one big huge thick box that probably wasn&rsquo;t meant to be recycled just yet.
<p>
Wende stayed at work cause she had to work, and I drove our box collection back home to get everything else ready for the day.
<p>
As I was sending <a href="/writing/old/fgnet/index.html">The Feel Good Net</a>, Jon W called and indicated he hadn&rsquo;t gotten quite as much completed with the Construct-O-Con Registration forms as he wanted.
<p>
No problem! We went to Kinko&rsquo;s with what he had completed, and totally blatantly used the OKC Rally Registration form as our form. We got the whole thing completed and all good in about 25 minutes.  Awesome.
<p>
Drove to the church, and in a huge collision of cardboard, 3 mil plastic, staple guns, weird lights and youth, they built a haunted house.
<p>
The greatest part is the youth design it, the youth direct the creation, the youth are in charge of their own project! I got to crawl inside a big box and simply watch it unfold.
<p>
At around 5 or 6 in the pm, the haunted house was declared complete. We chilled and chilled for a while, waiting for a couple youth to return from whatever they had to do, and decided what to do the rest of the night.
<p>
Finally, it was Sarah L, Paul R, Laura M, Adam W, Wende and I who went to 59 Diner to munch before we cruised out to The Haunted Hotel. Unfortunately, Laura began to feel blechy and had to call her parental units to come pick her up. I finished my Diner Salad and went outside with her to wait. We intended good health for her, and hoped she&rsquo;d be able to come see us at church the next day.
<p>
The rest of us drove to Haunted Hotel, but the line was like 5 million people and we were all &ldquo;no way!&rdquo; and rented <em>The Exorcist</em> instead.
<p>
We got back to the church around 11pm. Sarah had to leave and kT joined us to watch the movie and spend the night. So at this point it was me, Wende, Paul, Adam and kT.
<p>
Paul and Adam watched the movie. I watched it mostly from such an oblique angle that the image was all distorted and really didn&rsquo;t seem quite as scary. kT kinda watched and kinda bounced around the room on warm Dr Pepper energy. Wende did not watch, instead spent her time making bead bracelets.
<p>
kT and I each made a bracelet for one another. I made her a green one and she made me a blue one. I love it.
<p>
Then at 2am (or is it 1am because we set the clock back?) we crashed for the night.
