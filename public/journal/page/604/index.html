                        <p><p class=date>7:48am Sunday 13 August 2000</p>

<p><p>Just now, on the last day, after 24 previous mini entries, I have
recognized that I can just set the time on this to reflect my current time
zone.  That means now when I hit the [insert time stamp] keys, the time will
be Virginia time instead of Houston time.  My intention is to change all of
the previous timestamps from Houston time to Virginia time.</p>

<p><p>Interesting how I&rsquo;m comparing Houston to Virginia instead of Texas to
Virginia, or Houston to Emory.</p>

<p><p>This morning I got up for breakfast, walked to plenary hall to grab my
sandals, but it was locked.  The above mentioned walk takes like 5 minutes
each direction.   It seemed like a bigger pain at the time that it happened.</p>

<p><p class=date>7:51 am</p>

<p><p>Breakfast soon.</p>

<p><p class=date>10:51 am</p>

<p><p>Wow!  It&rsquo;s been three whole hours since my last entry!   Okay, breakfast
was fine and then walked back to clean up all our junk and clean the dorm.
The bus is supposed to be here at 11am.</p>

<p><p>We filled out evaluations for the anti-racism workshop and for the week
in general.  I didn&rsquo;t really follow the format of the questions, but just
rambled on the back of the page.</p>

<p><p class=date>10:54 am</p>

<p><p>People are carrying their goodies
to the parking lot.</p>

<p><p>Nathan is not sure when the busses will get here; he&rsquo;s been calling them
all morning but no answer.  They&rsquo;re supposed to get here at 11am.  did I
already say that?</p>

<p><p class=message>Wow- it&rsquo;s been one crazy, busy week.  Getting to see
everyone was amazing and I think we got tons of stuff done.  I&rsquo;m such a
business geek!  I am so ready to get home though.  Busy, busy summer coming
to an end.  Steering Committee should be fantastic and I think the new
Committee is awesome and we&rsquo;ll do tons of cool stuff.  I miss everyone from
Youth Council already and I hope everyone is doing wonderfully.  Rob Nugen-
I love you so much and I am so glad we got to hang out.  You&rsquo;ll be hearing
from me soon!
<br>Lots of love always,
<br>Micaela</p>

<p><p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><p class=message>Wow- Micaela has to write a full novel.  :)  Anway,  YC was
great.  We passed all kinds of neat proposals and resolustions.  Hopefully
they will make YRUU ten times better.  I am looking forward to the next YC
and con con.
  Yc was so cool for many reasons.  I really enjoyed the buissiness aspect.
I also like having such a small community. It makes life so much easier.
  I better shut up so I keep my essay smaller than Micaela&rsquo;s novel.
<br>Kayle</p>

<p><p class=date>8/13/00 11:50 am</p>

<p><p>Bus is here and we are pretty late, still loading it.  I hope everyone
makes their intended flight.</p>

<p><p>My flight is at 3:02pm.  No sweat.
So far, I know that Steve, Micaela, Kayle, Kate, and I think others are on
the same flight as me.</p>

<p><p>Elizabeth L has missed her flight.</p>

<p><p>Pam left her stuff on the parking lot, but we saw it in time.  Stopped
the bus and grabbed it.  Jen H ran up with a pile of lost and found clothing
and tossed it onto the passengers like onto a mosh pit.</p>

<p><p class=date>12:00 pm</p>

<p><p>Leaving Emory Henry College.  &ldquo;On the road again&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>12:12 pm</p>

<p><p>Butt to the butt butt butt butt butt butt butt butt butt</p>

<p><p class=date>1:32 pm</p>

<p><p>In the airport in the restaurant.  Elizabeth made her flight!!</p>

<p><p>Hugs and hugs and hugs as people leave for their flights.</p>

<p><p class=date>1:57 pm</p>

<p><p>Lunch is finished</p>

<p><p class=date>2:44 pm</p>

<p><p>Fun fun game with big blob of putty (hey, where is it?? (I think Micaela
has it)) molding it into a not round shape that would bounce in random
directions.  Matt, Steve, and I about 15 feet apart.. nice toss of putty
into the air and try to catch it after first bounce, which often bounced in
a wacky random direction.  Very cool.  :-)</p>

<p><p>Now about to board the plane.</p>

<p><p class=date>2:57 pm</p>

<p><p>I just wrote a letter on an air sickness bag and put it in the seat
pocket in front of me.  I put the date and my domain on it.</p>

<p><p>The engines are winding up, but people are still trying to be seated with
families together.</p>

<p><p>For Kayle to get in the security he had to remove his belt..  walked
through while holding his pants up with one hand</p>

<p><p class=date>3:27 pm</p>

<p><p>10,000 feet on our way to a cruising altitude of 16,000 feet.  I&rsquo;m
sitting with Melanie, who fell asleep holding a nice hardback version of
<em>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</em> in her lap; Julie is behind us
totally sleeping; Maia is up front somewhere; Micaela and Steve are playing
backgammon on his Palm Pilot.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ve got the big blob of putty after Micaela made me promise I would not
try again to throw it into her bag.</p>

<p><p>The features below us are identifiable and really small wen i can see
them through the big fluff layer of clouds strewn 5000 feet below us.</p>

<p><p>There&rsquo;s a high school aged girl across from Melanie and I, who was just
at a camp, and starting school tomorrow in Beaumont (90 minutes east of
Houston)</p>

<p><p class=date>4:20 pm</p>

<p><p>Just arrived in Atlanta.  Still on tarmac, still with engines on fast.</p>

<p><p>oh and Jacob was on this flight</p>

<p><p class=date>5:00 pm</p>

<p><p>Rode the train after dropping off Steve at a gate, 2 gates (and 30
seconds) away from our arrival gate.  Waved to Maia in the smoking area and
then rode the train from concourse C to councourse A.  Droped off Jacob at
his gate..</p>

<p><p>We didn&rsquo;t want to say bye..</p>

<p><p>He gave hugs all around. and more dawdling, then high fives all around..</p>

<p><p>then for good measure, &ldquo;zero, one, [clap] booyah!&rdquo;  We&rsquo;re so funny.</p>

<p><p>I kept singing the ditty &ldquo;in-appropriate, in-appropriate, in-appropriate,
inappropriate!&rdquo; song.</p>

<p><p>My gate was a couple steps down from his, so they group walked me to my
gate.  Hugs all around, and then high fives, and our &ldquo;zero, one&rdquo; [clap]
&ldquo;Booyah!&rdquo;  My last zero one booyah of the trip.</p>

<p><p>Now Micaela, Kate, Kayle, Julie are off in search of food.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m sitting on the floor looking around at peoples as I type.  I love
this little keybard thing.</p>

<p><p>There&rsquo;s some high schoolers beside me talking about movies&hellip;  maybe
they&rsquo;re in early college.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m so excited to see Wende in about 1.5 hours!!!</p>

<p><p class=date>5:20 pm</p>

<p><p>On the plane now, pretty much packed.  They asked for 6 people to give up
their seats in exchange for $550 and a flight voucher.  Nice deal.  I&rsquo;d
rather see Wende.</p>

<p><p class=date>5:22 pm</p>

<p><p>Cute sewardess.</p>

<p><p>Oh, an interesting thing: they had food in little sacks sitting in a
refridgerated cart at the boarding gate.  We had the option of grabbing food
on our way onto the plane.  Will they feed us otherwise?  A drink at least?
Very interesting.  I wonder how this makes money for them.</p>

<p><p>Maybe the flight therefore takes a more precise amount of food and less
food is wasted, and they don&rsquo;t have to spend fuel on carrying it around..
makes sense.</p>

<p><p class=date>5:25 pm</p>

<p><p>They just pressurized the cabin.  Ow, my ears!</p>

<p><p class=date>5:26 pm</p>

<p><p>Wow!  they just asked for five more volunteers and offered $800 each.
Sweet.</p>

<p><p>If it goes up again, I&rsquo;ll do it.</p>

<p><p class=date>5:28 pm</p>

<p><p>They have found all their volunteers.  I&rsquo;m glad I get to see Wende soon!
The next confirmed flight was for 11:45pm</p>

<p><p>Hey, where is the putty?  I&rsquo;ve lost it again.  Oh, wait-..  I gave it to
Steve when we were descending on the previous flight.  I tossed it to him
and he barely caught it as the plane was all bumpin (not musically, but
nauseously) on the way down.</p>

<p><p class=date>5:32 pm</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;re still parked, and they are saying we&rsquo;re departing soon.</p>

<p><p>Engines seem very quiet if they are on at all.  As we taxied in, I saw no
fewer than 9 (count-em, nine) 727s lined up for take-off.  I guess the
airport is pretty busy and we&rsquo;ll be backed up.</p>

<p><p class=date>5:35 pm</p>

<p><p>All electronics must be turned off.</p>

<p><p class=date>6:13 pm</p>

<p><p>We are in the air - just took off a few minutes ago.  I dozed as we
waited on the tarmac.  No altitude has been announced, but we are allowed to
use electronic devices again.</p>

<p><br>We&rsquo;re definitely higher than 16, 000 feet.</p>

<p><p class=date>6:28 pm</p>

<p><p>Interesting how the entire plane is almost silent, and how the entire
plane seemed to get out dinner as soon as the fasten seatbelt sign was
turned off.</p>

<p><p>Woman beside me is reading a color coded bible, and has a cheat sheet
written on a page as she reads.  It says:</p>

<p><p><pre>
Purple god - (Father, son &amp; Holy Spirit)
Red Dicipleship (obedience &amp; praise)
Green Love (Joy; kindness)
Orange Fatith (prayer; miracles)
Black Sin (evil; judgement)
</pre></p>

<p><p>She just tucked the page into the book; I can&rsquo;t read the rest.</p>

<p><p>I can&rsquo;t read the text of the bible, but the top heading is Joshua 7, and
a lot of the text is in ALL CAPS</p>

<pre>
AND TEH WALLS OF THE CITY WILL FALL DOWN;
THEN MOVE IN upon THE CITY FROM EVERY DIRECTION"
</pre>

<p><p>That was in a green section.</p>

<pre>GET UP! TELL THE PEOPLE,
'EACH OF YOU MUST UNDERGO PURIFICATION
RITES IN PREPARATION FOR TOMORROW.
FOR THE LORD YOUR GOD OF ISRAEL SAYS
THAT SOMEONE HAS STOELN FROM HIM AND
YOU CANNOT DEFEAT YOUR ENEMIES.
</pre>

<p><p>Doh - she shifted the book so I can&rsquo;t read more.  (Molly,) send me email
if you know who/what/where about colored-coded bibles.</p>

<p><p class=date>6:43 pm</p>

<p><p>Cute stewades served my orange juice and I chugged it before they even
moved the cart.  She asked if I needed more.   &ldquo;No thanks.  I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Captain just announced that we are flying 60,000 feet (I think).  I
confirmed it with cute stewardess, she said she thought it was in the 30&rsquo;s.
She called him and said it was 35,000 feet.</p>

<p><p>That&rsquo;s 6.6 miles!</p>

<p><p>That&rsquo;s twice as far as I live away from work.</p>

<p><p class=date>8/13/00 7:04 pm</p>

<p><p>My neighbor just closed her book to sleep.  It&rsquo;s <em>The Rainbow Study
Bible: Living Bible Edition</em></p>

<p><p>(It&rsquo;s now 7:06pm Sunday 13 August 2000, and I have fixed all the previous
timestamps)</p>

<p><p class=date>7:15 pm</p>

<p><p>Dozingishly, I felt the plane shift into slow gear; we are beginning our
descent.  I&rsquo;m switching back to Central Standard Time.</p>

<p><p class=date>6:18 pm</p>

<p><p>Time change complete. Magic.</p>

<p><p class=date>6:22 pm</p>

<p><p>70 miles out - expecting a 6:45pm arrival time.  1 minute past what was
published.</p>

<p><p class=date>6:28 pm</p>

<p><p>turn off electronics</p>

<p><p class=date>6:44 pm</p>

<p><p>Arrival.  On time according to my clock.  I&rsquo;m in seat 27, plenty of
people to wait behind before I can get off.  They haven&rsquo;t opened the doors
yet, but the engines are coasting to a stop.</p>

<p><p>The landing was bumpy, and quick decelleration.   Fun to watch the
houston skyline and higways below us as we descended.  I cold see where UH
was, but I looked out the wrong side of the plane at first.  I&rsquo;m in the
middle seat, so I could see out both sides equally well.</p>

<p><p class=date>6:48 pm</p>

<p><p>Still have not opened the door yet.</p>

<p><p class=date>6:49 pm</p>

<p><p>Now it&rsquo;s open.  Whee!!  I get to see Wende!!!!!!</p>

<p><p>Robin and I will perform freestyle beatbox during
the talent show which was supposed to start at 9:30.
The new Steering Committee is still meeting; we are
guessing the talent show will be at more like 10:30.</p>

<p><p>We just practiced a bit.  Nice.</p>

<p><p>Carissa showed me her Beastie Boys <em>Sounds of
Science</em> album, which I had never seen nor
listened to.  I definitely want to purchase the album
now.  I love the mix of &ldquo;Body Movin&rsquo;&rdquo; !</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m considering attending the Youth Advisor
Training Training in November.  If I attend, I will be
called to run youth advisor trainings around the
country.  Sounds way cool and way youth empowering!</p>

<p><p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>In an apartment being shown the apartment by a realator
(Allison) and another realator was showing the same aapartment at the same
time and we treid to keep thr groups apart, but someone started fighting
about notghing and I snuck out aand looked for a phone to Call 9111.  Chris
from my I-group had his fphone and called.</p>

<p><p class=date>8:40</p>

<p><p>Breakfast was quiet; people are tired.  We&rsquo;re about to set up some Nitty
Gritty Committees, each charged with making the final decision about some of
the decisions the entire group was taking too long to make.</p>

<p><p>We are using formal consensus this year; meaning basically that everyone
gets a voice in the matter.</p>

<p><p class=date>12:40</p>

<p><p>After lunch, I lay on a short brick wall to warm up in the sun.  Paris
joined me and we lay head to head with my hat halfway on both our heads,
covering our eyes.</p>

<p><p>Talked to Carissa about Beastie Boys latest album; she pretty much sold
me on it so I&rsquo;m going to get it.</p>

<p><p>The last plenary starts now; so we can hash out all the rest of the
resolutions.</p>

<p><p class=date>14:16</p>

<p><p>Break from plenary for 5 minutes; some people have to leave now.</p>

<p><p class=date>14:37</p>

<p><p>We just did the &ldquo;Go Bananas!&rdquo; energy break.  Fun!</p>

<p><p class=date>16:04</p>

<p><p>Ugh.  Just spent 1.5 hours dialoguing about how to handle a pile of grant
money coming in 2003.  Came to the decision that it will be discussed for a
year until next Youth Council</p>

<p><p class=date>17:04</p>

<p><p>Just finished the last of plenary.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Zero, One! &rdquo;  [clap]  &ldquo;Booyah!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>17:25</p>

<p><p>Dinner now.  Spirits are high.  I can hear rhythmic clapping in the
cafeteria.</p>

<p><p class=date>18:04</p>

<p><p>Last year, if I&rsquo;m remembering correctly, we finished plenary super super
late on the last day- like 1 or 2am on the day we had to leave.</p>

<p><p>So wonderful that we have finished so amazingly early this year!  I look
forward to extensive YRUU games, including the lovely and fun Silent
Football for as long as possible.  THere are some proponents and opponents
to the game, and some people who have never played.  I think we have a big
enough group to draw from.</p>

<p><p>Diner was fun; I sat at a table with Carissa and Sonja and Blue.  Dinner
conversation basically consisted of Blue and Sonja talking about punk bands
and punk lifestyle.</p>

<p><p>At 6:30 are Steering Committee elections.  I am choosing not to run.</p>

<p><p class=date>18:46</p>

<p><p>SC elections being explained</p>

<p><p class=date>19:13</p>

<p><p>Laura D was elected as GA Business Manager</p>

<p><p class=date>12:32</p>

<p><p>I am all about Silent Football</p>

<p><p class=graffitti>Geoff Schwarz is the coolest ever.  Really he is!</p>

<p><p class=date>1:07</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;re going to play Silent Football at 1:30am</p>

<p><p class=date>1:51</p>

<p><p>Silent Football rules being explained by Nathan,  &ldquo;And he would do stuff
and it&rsquo;s funny and stuff&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>2:17am Sunday 13 August 2000</p>

<p><p>Oh my gosh.  this is the new highlight of continental Silent Football.</p>

<p><p>Mimi (who had been dubbed &ldquo;Miss Bitchface&rdquo;) was making lewd gestures at
Melanie, who tattled on Mimi repeatedly.</p>

<p><p>Finally Nathan was all, &ldquo;Miss Bitchface, it&rsquo;s time for your punishment.
Miss Melanie will give you a spanking in the middle of the circle.   So why
don&rsquo;t you just come out here and grab your ankles.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Amidst uproarious laughter, including her own, Mimi stood in the middle
of the circle and grabbed her ankles.</p>

<p><p>Nathan: &ldquo;Oh, and if you have anything to say for yourself, you may do it
while you&rsquo;re being spanked.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Mimi in tears of laughter, trying to talk, but it was so funny that she
couldn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p><p>Then suddenly Nathan and about 5 others started to laugh even more and
Mimi ran out of the circle.  I didn&rsquo;t actually <em>see</em> it; she was turned away
from my side of the circle, but about 5 or 6 people actually saw it happen.</p>

<p><p>The game proceeded and Mimi returned a few minutes later.</p>

<p><p>Nathan interrupted Blue (I think) who was tattling. &ldquo;Excuse me, Miss
Blue, not to imply that what you are saying is not important, but I&rsquo;d like
to hear from Miss Mimi.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Mimi amidst more laughter: &ldquo;Miss Bitchface kind of soiled herself when
Miss Bitchface was acted upon in a punitive manner&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>2:21</p>

<p><p>Someone called Nathan &ldquo;Mr hot love meat curly fry&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>2:24</p>

<p><p>Mimi farted with a big lean over and &ldquo;pppppbb&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>2:42</p>

<p><p>We are now in the basement and chips are being passed around.</p>

<p><p class=date>2:58</p>

<p><p>Gut busting laughter and shrieks due to a teeny moth flying around.  Mimi
said that members were experiencing spontaneous orgasms.</p>

<p><p>Each time anyone says, &ldquo;Miss Lucy,&rdquo; Miss Mimi says, &ldquo;had a steamboat&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>3:00</p>

<p><p>Game is abruptly ended due to mass confusion.</p>

<p><p class=date>3:09am Sunday 13 August 2000</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m in bed now.   Thanks to all for a ridiculously funny game!!</p>

<p><p>Good night.  We leave tomorrow!</p>

                        <p><p class=date>7:33am Friday 11 August 2000</p>

<p><p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>At an intersection in a car drivng with a little kid in the
front seat and we were like giving advice about school; we wre saying about
when he should study (schoolwise, like he needs to study in HS,so he can get
good college choices) but he doesn&rsquo;t have to study now in elementary</p>

<p><p class=dream>walt was in the back seat of the car with me.</p>

<p><p>There was a ton more to this dream starting off, but I don&rsquo;t remember it.</p>

<p><p class=dream>ooh there was a roller coaster in my dream and it stopped <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
way through the circuit, as we were waiting for it in the middle of its
circuit and I hit the emergency stop button so it nknew to stop.  we all got
ona nd signed forms to say we knew the rules and then the scene melted into
somethig else beore we actually rode it.</p>

<p><p class=date>8:52</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;ve been moved to a gymnasium with a track around its perimeter halfway
up the two story wall.  I have discovered that running around the track
results in a tremendous thunderous rhythmic
thum-thum-thum-thum-thum-thum-thum-thum-thum-thum resoundingly magnificent.</p>

<p><p>We are informally presenting our proposals to the group in a Resolution
Circus</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We need 30 CCs of resolution, stat!&rdquo;  Nathan announces.</p>

<p><p>Most youth are ridiculously tired.  People were up until 2, 3, 4 o&rsquo;clock
in the morning.   The accoustics in this gym are sucky echoey, making it
even more difficult to hear people.</p>

<p><p class=message>I love Rob!</p>

<p><p class=date>11/8/00 12:42</p>

<p><p>The Resolution Circus was fun; I got some good suggestions for our
resolutiion.  I retyped it in html, which is a much cooler technique than
stupid MS word.</p>

<p><p>Lunch was yummy; I talked to Steve and Nathan about funny stuff.</p>

<p><p>Now we&rsquo;re going to hear from Bill Sinkford, a UUA presidential candidate.
Looks like he has T-shirts to give out????  (They&rsquo;re squashed into bricks)</p>

<p><p>As Bill is being introduced, I recognize that I&rsquo;m already against him
just for campaigning.  He just said, &ldquo;Yes, there is a website; Diane doesn&rsquo;t
have one yet.&rdquo;   Diane is one of his opponents.   The rumor that she does or
does not have a website are not his to announce.</p>

<p><p class=date>13:41</p>

<p><p>The room we&rsquo;re in now for the presidential thing is way better
accoustically; we&rsquo;re moving our plenary into this room.</p>

<p><p class=date>14:01</p>

<p><p>Almost moved in I think.  Sonja, my Puddy is not here; I don&rsquo;t know where
she is.</p>

<p><p class=date>14:23</p>

<p><p>Jen said, &ldquo;Be sure to ask someone instead of barrel-assing through&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>14:40</p>

<p><p>My project proposal passed!!   &ldquo;Zero, One&rdquo; [clap!] &ldquo;Booyah!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>15:38</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;ve been zipping through the passing of the proposals; now we get a 12
minute break until 3:50</p>

<p><p class=date>16:24</p>

<p><p>Oh, I forgot to mention this earlier:  Steve has suggested and encouraged
me to attend the Youth Advisor Training Training (so I can be trained to
train youth advisors)  I know I would be good at it; I understand youth
empowerment and can easily model that for other advisors.  I work well with
youth, and it would be a ton of fun!</p>

<p><p>I think I&rsquo;ll go for it; the training is in November.</p>

<p><p class=date>17:02</p>

<p><p>Plenary is complete..  this was plenary 5.  Good job us!!!  (We didn&rsquo;t
get through all the resolutions though.)</p>

<p><p class=date>18:40</p>

<p><p>Nathan chasing Helen around the cafeteria.  Helen had his hat.  Out one
door she went, and out of my mind.</p>

<p><P>Then Helen suddenly behind Melanie, &ldquo;up up up!&rdquo;   Melanie stood up, [hat
in Melanie&rsquo;s seat] &ldquo;down down down&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Hat is hidden.  Nathan has no idea where.</p>

<p><p class=date>21:33</p>

<p><p>Almost at the end of anti racist training.   we have entered into a 15
minute silence after a workshop.</p>

<p><p>After the silence, we were encoraged to do some freeform writing.  I
wrote some angry words similar quality as in <em>The Sixth Sense</em>.</p>

<p><p>I didn&rsquo;t feel comfortable expressing this to the youth, but I did share
with Alison after we paired up to talk about stuff.   She and I went outside
 and talked more, expressing confusion and shame and sadness about different
things.</p>

<p><p>I used my men&rsquo;s group listening skills and listened a lot; gave her some
ideas about how to express her anger.</p>

<p><p>I felt honored by Alison that she could tell me her feelings.  I told her
this.</p>

<p><p>Some sadness being expressed in the group now about some discrimination
that has happened even during this week.</p>

<p><p>This has been a great week.  The youth have done <em>so much</em> work on
themselves this week.  I am so proud of them.</p>

<p><p class=date>0:59</p>

<p><p>Emotionally intense closure - mostly a lot of sadness.  I am greatly
thankful that I had processed my feelings with Alison so that I was
emotionally available for the youth.</p>

<p><p>I just consulted my runes about being trained as an advisor trainer.  The
runes seemed to say Go For It, but the process my be disrupted or take
longer than I expect.</p>

                        <p><p class=date>8:49am Thursday 10 August 2000</p>

<p><p>Robin and I did freestyle beatbox before the anti-racisim training.  We
may perform and have Blue and/or Justin do freestyle vocals or dance.</p>

<p><p>Watched a scene of Star Trek about the Borg and assimilation</p>

<p><p>Here&rsquo;s an energy break song:</p>

<p><p>Front to front to front my baby
<br>Back to back to back my baby
<br>side to side to side my baby
<br>this is how we do it</p>

<p><p>Come along and ride that pony
<br>Come along and ride that pony
<br>Come along and ride that pony
<br>This is how we do it</p>

<p><p><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of people inside the circle and ride the pony during &ldquo;come along and
ride&rdquo;  then face someone and dance according to front to front back to back
side to side part and then switch with the person</p>

<p><p class=date>11:33am</p>

<p><p>Blue describing the pain she felt when people called her &ldquo;flat face&rdquo; and
laughed at her eyes.  I can hear the pain in her story; I judge she still
has internalized sadness and pain.</p>

<p><p>Jennifer expressing how she got &ldquo;flat face&rdquo; comments, but felt more pain
about her glasses; she didn&rsquo;t feel pretty if she wore her glasses.  That&rsquo;s
exactly the same as me.</p>

<p><p>Leno is 15 and apparently not familiar with YRUU culture(?)  He introed a
song by Rage Against The Machine and was essentially warning us that it
would be loud and have some bad words in it.  So cute!!</p>

<p><p class=date>13:09</p>

<p><p>Joey and Jesse are guest speaking representatives from the Young Adult
organization, <a href="https://www.uuyan.org">www.uuyan.org</a>.</p>

<p><p class=date>13:21</p>

<p><p>Now we are collecting and organizing the brainstorms people had for the
next 5 years of YRUU</p>

<p><p class=date>14:06</p>

<p><p>Our little group is going to write a resolution for a 5 year plan to
deepen the YRUU and  UU faith</p>

<p><p class=date>14:18</p>

<p><p>Each of the three groups presented ideas; hopefully we will get three big
resolutions passed this year.</p>

<p><p class=date>14:50</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;re on the bus to zip off to the Super Secret Super Activity!!  I&rsquo;m
beside Matt, who knows what it is, but won&rsquo;t tell me.   We&rsquo;ve been asked to
bring warm clothing, flashlights, sunscreen, money&hellip;   Some of these items
I know are bogus ideas to throw us off&hellip;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;They are bogus; it&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; says Matt, &ldquo;except for the warm clothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>He&rsquo;s wearing pants and has a long sleeve shirt.</p>

<p><p>Zach, the bus driver addressed us: &ldquo;My name is Zach, and this is my bus.
I take care of it.  All I ask of you is that you keep it clean.  So if you
have any drinks or anything, please take care not to spill.  We&rsquo;re all going
to have a great time&hellip; if only someone would tell me where we are going.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>14:58</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;re slaughtering a version of Madonna&rsquo;s &ldquo;Like a Prayer&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>14:59</p>

<p><p>Just got a trucker to honk for us.</p>

<p><p class=date>15:02</p>

<p><p>truck two honked for us!</p>

<p><p>Here&rsquo;s the lyrics of a game chant thing:</p>

<p><p>Concentration
<br>fifty-four
<br>no repeats
<br>no hesitations
<br>category
<br>________
<br>Okay
<br>I&rsquo;ll start</p>

<p><p>And the idea is that each person in the circle has to name something from
the category when it&rsquo;s their turn.  May not repeat what anyone else has
said.</p>

<p><p class=date>10/8/00 15:39</p>

<p><p>En route to Super Secret, Jeff just said at the Bristol Speedway we are
not allowed to touch the cars.</p>

<p><p>Matt Just said there will be a concentration of oxygen.</p>

<p><p>I think we are going to a cave; we are in Tennessee.</p>

<p><p class=date>15:41</p>

<p><p>Zach just pointed out Vince Gill&rsquo;s house.  I think I took a picture of
the right one.  Now the youth are slaughtering a Vince Gill song I&rsquo;m
guessing.</p>

<p><p class=date>15:44</p>

<p><p>Nathan, unimpressed with seeing Vince Gill&rsquo;s house, sarcastically yelling
out the window, &ldquo;hey horse!  I just saw Vince Gill&rsquo;s house!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>15:45</p>

<p><p>We have arrived.  I was right: &ldquo;Welcome to appalachian Caverns&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>17:09</p>

<p><p>The cave was pretty fly.  Saw a few bats and went down a couple hundred
feet.  Fun formations but the cave is not super amazing since it was just
uncovered in 1988 or so - the entrance had been filled with 162 thousand
pounds of trash.</p>

<p><p>Coolest thing is there&rsquo;s a river at the bottom that is fed by 2 springs
and a lake apparently.</p>

<p><p>The coolest thing about the tour: We sang like monks in a darkened cavern
with beautiful melodious angelic echoes.  so peaceful and so beautiful.  We
are great!</p>

<p><p>here&rsquo;s Blue:</p>

<p><p class=message>that trip was awesome. it brings me back to the carlsbad
caverns that i visted last summer. we got to see the stalagtites and mites
when they were just pearls there. i love worship. i got to sing alot. and i
love singing. this is my second con. and i really love the community. it&rsquo;s
weird to think that things will end soon. and i never knew anyone else to
know so mucha bout things that i am passionate about. like the punk rock
academy song, s.o.a. , and social action&rsquo;s importance. it makes me feel
loved which i don&rsquo;t feel much at home. here. is wonderful, people really
care, they see people for their inner beauty,a nd as forme, my own true
childishness, innocence, and love for people. i haven&rsquo;t seen so many genuine
smiles, in a long time, i would love to live a life with this true wacky
happiness for the rest of my life. uuism fills these people with something i
have never found in anyother group i have ever met, it is the spirit of love
and happiness and freeness that generates through all of us. it is something
i have never felt so strongly, only at cons and with these people have i
ever felt this way. as for anti racist education, i am glad that i realized
so much about racism here, and not any where else. because people care
genuinly care here. and i am not afraid to smile, care, be open, and love
other people. i feel that this is what will give me emotional strength to
help me through school. this con has really let me see how much i can be
appreciated and loved, and how i should appreciate myself, and love myself,
for all of my good and bad qualities. Thank you every one for giving me this
experience, i will never be the same again&hellip; gratias, tanks, and thanks&hellip;</p>

<p><p class=date>18:27</p>

<p><p>Part 2 of  the Super Secret activity visting a art sale thing with booths
and booths and food and crafts and all kinds of fun stuff.  We at sandwiches
and cookes and walked around not too far; the booths were pretty much all
closing.  and it&rsquo;s only 6:30 local time.  In Houston the show would have
just been getting started!</p>

<p><p>Now we&rsquo;re driving to maybe a part 3 of SSA, but I don&rsquo;t know for certain;
it&rsquo;s a secret!</p>

<p><p>Zach is driving with the door open to get some air circulation.  Cool</p>

<p><p class=date>19:00</p>

<p><p>Wow.</p>

<p><p>The third part of the Super Secret:  watching the band perform!</p>

<p><p>I wanted to watch their parents&rsquo; night, so happy that we get to see it!</p>

<p><p>I learned the name of Angie, who I had met in the cafeteria; she&rsquo;s on the
staff of this bandcamp.</p>

<p><p class=date>19:31</p>

<p><p>I just beat Laura at Concentration 54 in the category &ldquo;Types of Music&rdquo;
with &ldquo;Chickenskin&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>The band was fly, and performed jazzy versions of &ldquo;Home on the Range&rdquo;,
something else, and something from The Color Purple.</p>

<p><p class=date>19:45</p>

<p><p>Maia says:</p>

<p><p class=messages>SO then I was all impressed that at my next rally, which
was Austin 96, that Jeremy remembered me.  So basically I hung out with him
and Katy perkins and Curtis.  That&rsquo;s the first time I remember you from.
That was a cool rally.  We all went to Barton Springs and it was all kinds
of boss.  After that, I didn&rsquo;t go to another rally until Houston 97 (Bif!)
and then I didn&rsquo;t miss another rally for like 2 and a half years.  Yeah my
rally history.</p>

<p><p class=date>2:38am Friday 11 august 2000</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;ve been up writing resolutions and project proposals.  I wrote a short
project proposal to create some electronic resources (templates) to make it
easier to write resolutions and project proposals.</p>

<p><p>Turns out that I&rsquo;m not allowed to sponsor the proposal myself, so Ann is
the point contact, and I&rsquo;m her Primary Aid, and I do all the work.</p>

<p><p>At about midnight, we had worship, which started with consumption
(inhalation) of 4 large pizzas.  Then we sat in a circle and described
ou(*)r first crush or our first kiss.  Then Unconditional Love to complete
the worship.</p>

<p><p>Above at the (*) is the moment where my Visor gave me a warning of low
batteries.  I quickly popped the new ones in, retained all my information,
and have full batteries!</p>

<p><p>So now it&rsquo;s about 2:43am; I&rsquo;m going to shower and then sleep!</p>

<p><p>HI!</p>

<p><p>Today was the super secret activity!  I&rsquo;ll give you
the short version now.  There were three parts to it:</p>

<ol>
<p><li>Visiting Appalachian Caverns, a small recently
uncovered cave in Tennessee

<p><li>Visiting a small art fair thing, but mostly all
the shops were closing when we got there at 6pm

<p><li>Watching a high school band perform for
Parents' Night at the end of their band camp!  That
was fun.  They've been on this same college campus as
us (Emory & Henry College in Virginia)
</ol>

<p><p>Right now everyone is in the computer lab writing
resolutions to be presented to the group tomorrow.
Resolutions direct the actions of Youth Council
members for the next year.   This week we&rsquo;ve been
doing some 5 year planning, so hopefully our
resolutions will take an even grander scope.</p>

<p><p>I think I come back on Sunday night, and I have
written <em>so much</em> in my Handspring Visor.</p>

<p><p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>We were on a Hawaiian Island in a big field.  We = a lot of
YRUU people.  Someone said, look at that tornado they&rsquo;re having over there.
We looked over and certainly there was some cloud disturbance, but it was
not a tornado.  A youth told him so.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Then from the same direction, something was coming toward us,
and there were screams from that direction.  It was a flood of water
careening across the land, and headed toward us.  Many people ran away from
it, but I ran sideways across its path, kind of up hill.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I ran to a picnic table and was followed by two youth,
Micaela and Matt.  They said that this flood was the doing of some powerful
individual who was trying to frighten people off the land.  They had been
given some sort of voucher that bought them out of a portion of their land
after the previous scary thing.  This was just another such event.</p>

<p><p class=note>(another dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>Computer was on in this house and we could see an eror log
coming up about AIM instant messages being sent and errors from this one
computer that could not connect.</p>

<p><p class=note>(another dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream> was walking with a with Blue who had her eyes closed and was
walking backwards, like a trust walk and I told her &ldquo;step up&rdquo;  &ldquo;step down&rdquo;
as appropriate and then we all (there was a group) reached this huge large
overlook bluff thing that looed over the city.  I couldnt&rsquo;t safely navigate
her blindly down this steeep hill, so we stopped and had our trustees open
their eyes.</p>

<p><p class=date>7:16</p>

<p>I thought it was 6:15, but in this here time zone it&rsquo;s 7:15 and breakfst is
in 15 minutes.  Thanks, Steve for knowing what&rsquo;s the time!</p>

<p><p class=date>7:38</p>

<p><p>Nathan:
<pre>
Oh Nathan I&rsquo;m so fine
I&rsquo;m so fine I blow my mind
hey Nathan</p>

<p>Oh Nathan what a pity
I don&rsquo;t understand.
I take me by the heart
when I take me by the hand
</pre></p>

<p><p>These youth are so funny!!</p>

<p><p>I cried after the anit-racisim workshop today.  That was not the
intention of the workshop, but I realized just how racistally I have acted
in the past.</p>

<p><p class=date>11:04</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;re in the computer lab looking at the yruu website and some possible
new sites</p>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s during this that I wrote my HI and Bye entry on Wednesday.</p>

<p><p>I expressed encouragment that the group take a proverbial step back from
the website design process and ask the basic questions of intended audience
and goals of the site.</p>

<p><p class=date>12:20pm</p>

<p><p>Lunch was cool; I talked to Christine who works for anti-racism stuff in
the UUA.  She&rsquo;s cool.</p>

<p><p class=date>14:13</p>

<p><p>just did brainstorming for 5 year YRUU plan</p>

<p><p class=date>15:10</p>

<p><p>Paris is so funny!  He just made the statement that he intends to
memorize the continental YRUU bylaws within 1 month.</p>

<p><p class=date>17:57</p>

<p><p>now it&rsquo;s after dinner..  Paris just played the entire &ldquo;Happy Phantom&rdquo; by
Tori Amos</p>

<p><p class=date>18:39</p>

<p><p>Ultimate was way fun for a few minutes, and then just tossing around with
jason.   Free time now while some committees are meeting.
 (ultimate was during free time)</p>

<p><p class=date>19:52</p>

<p><p>We just got mail and I got a letter from Wende!!!   A card actually.  So
loving and perfect!!</p>

<p><p>The ultimate disc was missed by Nathan (who really tried to catch it) and
is floating in the duck pond.  Eww.</p>

<p><p>I did some optical analysis of the pond and have determined that it is
spring fed.  I can&rsquo;t see an exact specific spot that it comes in, but an
area of the water is certainly more clear.</p>

<p><p class=date>20:30   Wednesday evening</p>

<p><p>We ran about 1.5 miles I&rsquo;m guessing - jogged more like and happened to be
near where the band was practicing so I watched them for a bit.  Turns out
that toomorrow they are having their last day of practice and then it&rsquo;s
parents&rsquo; night at 7pm or so.  I wonder if we will be able to watch it.  I
think so; we usually have a break around then, but I don&rsquo;t know for sure.
After running we played frisbee some and now I&rsquo;m going to take a shower.
Wait..  we have a dance tonight; I&rsquo;ll just get all sweaty again.  Doh!!
I&rsquo;ll inventory my clothing and see if I&rsquo;ll change or not.</p>

<p><p class=date>21:15pm</p>

<p><p>YRUU is the greatest thing on the planet.  We just had a cool worship
that included a ceremonial bridging by each individual walking across a
bridge that crosses a stream in what would otherwise be an open grassy
field.</p>

<p><p>But that&rsquo;s not why YRUU is the greatest thing in the world.  I was just
talking to Justin about hip hop and turntablism and DJ stuff when he was
all, &ldquo;hey, do you think you could get my album on the air?&rdquo;   I am thrilled
to put it through the music library process and I told him so.  Maybe we&rsquo;ll
get his album on the air!</p>

<p><p>But that is not why YRUU is the greatest thing in the world.  We just
learned a game called &ldquo;54 categories&rdquo; (or something) which is a rhythmic
clapping and requires quick verbal thinking and is pretty funny.</p>

<p><p>But that&rsquo;s not why YRUU is the greatest thing in the world.  YRUU is the
greatest thing in the world because it is.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>At 10:30, we meet our blind dates for a dance.  I&rsquo;m supposed to meet mine
at room 208.</p>

<p><p class=date>23:52</p>

<p><p>The dance was fun, and my dream came true!  Almost..  The dance ended
early as we received news that a powerful thunderstorm is approaching the
campus.  50 and 60 mph wind apparently.  So we all trekked back uphill to
the dorms.</p>

<p><p>Even though we are certainly expected to stay inside the dorms, I would
love to go outside and experience it.  I don&rsquo;t know if I will or not; there
are lots of youth in the hall.</p>

<p><p class=date>12:38am</p>

<p><p>I joined several youth watching the storm on the outdoor balcony of our
building.  A few youth slid down the grassy hill like a waterslide!  That is
way way so much fun, but I chose not to join them.  The rain was pretty
cold, just when it splashed us on the balcony; I certainly didn&rsquo;t want to be
soaked.</p>

<p><p>When I came in here to write this entry, I believed the storm had mostly
passed.  But we just got a big-ish thunderclap.  I still think the storm is
pretty much finished.</p>

<p><p class=date>12:42am Thursday</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m going to bed.</p>

<p><p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>Dreamt that Steve asked me about the history of why we have
codeans for SWUUSI and the history of that. I was all, well let&rsquo;s ask some
of the older youth and see - youth like Shawn T (1998)  Deborah  D (1989)
Jenny K (1987)</p>

<p><p>In parenthesis are graduation dates approx</p>

<p><p class=dream>I suddenly found myself crying cause I hadn&rsquo;t seen Deborah in
so long.  Then I woke up just before the wake up crew came in to sing
quietly to us.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m  curious about that emotional response - I don&rsquo;t feel all tearful
about it now that I am awake; I wonder if that sadness is actually buried in
me (and would like to come out), or if it&rsquo;s apparent sadness that represents
something else..</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p class=date>7:57</p>

<p><p>At breakfast, Micaela described to me her conversation with Fricke when
he first became vegan.  He didn&rsquo;t know what he could eat.
<br>Micaela: &ldquo;No, that has lard in it.&rdquo;
<br>Jason: &ldquo;Oh, and I can&rsquo;t eat that?&rdquo;
<br>&ldquo;No, you can&rsquo;t&rdquo;
<br>&ldquo;Dammit!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>8:34</p>

<p><p>Slowly trickling into our seats for the racial awarensss workshop.</p>

<p><p>We played hacky sack and I was pretty impressed with how well I did!  I
got a few kicks using the back of my calf and bottom of my foot.</p>

<p><p class=message>this is so amazing. so so so (!!!) amazing.  I&rsquo;m just
impressed with this tiny kegboard adn tiny screen.  it&rsquo;s beyond amazing.  hi
helen this is so cool !!!</p>

<p><p class=date>11:18</p>

<p><p>Did a lot of visioning what we want our anti-racist organization to
ultimately embody.   The group is doing great work.</p>

<p><p class=date>12:18</p>

<p><p>Lunch was lovely; I had a lot of lettuce (with a slice of pizza under
it), some pineapple (with chocolate pudding under it) and some granola
cereal (with lucky charms under it)</p>

<p><p>I absentmindedly dipped my pizza in pudding and the group was grossed
out.  I told them I had only found 2 combinations of food that I would eat
separately but tasted really badly together:  Surge and blueberry ice cream
float, and orange juice and rootbeer mix.  Ick.</p>

<p><p>At 12:30 we have plenary (10 minutes or so)</p>

<p><p class=date>15:15</p>

<p><p>We had Puddy Olympics to begin Plenary.  2nd year YCers have been matched
up with a first year YCer and the relationship is called Puddy short for
Plenary Buddy.</p>

<p><p>Olymiad required not using our hands, and using a spoon to pick up little
colored eggs with Silly Putty in them.  Then without dropping the eggs,
carrying them back to the starting line.</p>

<p><p>Back inside, we accepted our moderator Alison and then we got an
introduction to the Formal Consensus Process.</p>

<p><p>Then during break we just tossed the frisbee around some.   Now break is
over and we&rsquo;re going to practice consensus on a mock resolution.</p>

<p><p>Sonja, my Puddy, and I are making little putty shapes and stuff.
Interestingly, she made a graduation-of-color-line this year just like I did
last year.</p>

<p><p class=date>16:19</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m glad we did the mock resolution; I didn&rsquo;t realize how confusing it
could be within the discussion, keeping track of where we are in the
Consensus Process.</p>

<p><p class=date>17:00</p>

<p><p>Various leaders are describing resources and the state of the budget and
stuff.   Dinner soon.</p>

<p><p>I think I am going to describe a resource - the adults&hellip; I have nothing
prepared, but it&rsquo;s okay.  People want to go eat soon.</p>

<p><p class=date>19:20</p>

<p><p>After dinner, which was really yummy, we had a 30 minute break during
which we tossed the disk around a bit.</p>

<p><p>Back inside, Blue played an amazing beautiful piano thing that I
recognized as Tori Amos, but I hadn&rsquo;t heard the particular song before.
Turns out it was not Tori Amos composed, but Blue wrote the riffs
<em>herself</em> and just tied them all together and made up lyrics.</p>

<p><p>So so incredible!!!  Easily the quality of Tori Amos.  Amazing.</p>

<p><p>Now touchgroup is trading embarassing (and funny) stories.</p>

<p><p class=date>20:29</p>

<p><p>I read an article/story written about Silent Football by Bryn.  She
described her history of SF games, starting with her first, where Danny K
received  the football, looked startled, and ran off with it.  So funny!  We
were in a corner hallway of OKC church at a rally and it was so funny!!!</p>

<p><p>I cried after reading her story.  Bryn is in Australia for a year,
starting just a few days ago.  I look forward to hearing her stories and
playing more silent football with her.</p>

<p><p>Then rumors of swimming (I&rsquo;m back here at YC) so we went to the pool but
they said no swimming because it lightning outside.  Indoor pool&hellip;??</p>

<p><p>Now we&rsquo;re inside singing &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve Lost That Lovin&rsquo; Feeling&rdquo; and Steve is
playing guitar and I don&rsquo;t know this song, but that&rsquo;s okay.</p>

<p><p>Now we&rsquo;re singing</p>

<p><p><ol>
<li>&ldquo;Rocky Racoon&rdquo;
<li>&ldquo;Yellow Submarine&rdquo;
<li>&ldquo;Working Overtime&rdquo; by BTO
<li>&ldquo;Standing on the ground&rdquo; (?)
<li>&ldquo;American Pie&rdquo;
<li> &ldquo;Faith&rdquo;  by George Michael
<li>&ldquo;The Boxer&rdquo; (the bridge only)
<li>&ldquo;I wanna hold your hand&rdquo;
<li>&lsquo;there was a worm stuck in my straw&rsquo;  (acapella by Alison)
<li>&ldquo;Let it be&rdquo;
<li>&ldquo;Imagine&rdquo;  (as soap bubbles floated over the circle)
<li>&ldquo;Kinghts in White Satin&rdquo;
</ol></p>

<p><p class=date>21:21</p>

<p><p>I left the singing circle.</p>

<p><p class=date>22:04</p>

<p><p>meeting now for Identity Groups (30 minutes late)</p>

<p><p class=date>23:19</p>

<p><p>Group was cool and then we rejoined as a big groupup again and bonded
well.  Paris is so funny.  I love him!</p>

<p><p class=date>0:05</p>

<p><p>Worship was nice; love and hugs all around.  I walked back to our dorm
with Laura D; we talked about art she has created and I told her about the
marble track I built.</p>

<p><p>Sleep soon.</p>

<p><p>Getting up was certainly a slight challenge after not sleeping
particularly long.  Super smooth fast drive to John and Maggie&rsquo;s house and
John drove me to the airport on his way to work.  Thanks, John!!</p>

<p><p>We talked work stuff; he described his travel-filled job; I described the
fun bouncy ball applet I wrote.</p>

<p><p>At the airport now, and going through the metal detector, I started
pulling out all my stuff - camera, Visor, keyboard&hellip; and the guy was all
impressed with the keyboard.  Yay!  I love my Visor.</p>

<p><p>Bought two AAA batteries for $3.69 + tax in case I need them this week.</p>

<p><p>Flight leaves at 9:00am</p>

<p><p class=date>9:17am</p>

<p><p>In the air without incident.  Talkative older men behind me.  Reading
steering committee minutes from their semi-annual meetings.</p>

<p><p class=date>10:00</p>

<p><p>They gave out little granola packets instead of peanuts or raisins and I
love it!!!  I ate three little packets.  And <em>just</em> as I was planning
to write this entry, the guy across the aisle from me was all, &ldquo;this is
terrible,&rdquo; giving the bag to the stewardess,  &ldquo;do you have <em>anything</em>
else?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Come on, man, this stuff is great!!</p>

<p><p class=date>11:45</p>

<p><p>just arrived.  flight was smooth but a tad bumpy at the end..  just
coming down through the cloud layers..  I read a lot of minutes from
Steering Committee&rsquo;s meetings.  Took notes and made lots of comments too..
Odd that I don&rsquo;t have a pen or blank paper with me - just my Visor.  what an
irony.   :-)</p>

<p><p class=date>12:03</p>

<p><p>My favorite thing about Atlanta airport is the crazy fun underground
train!  It&rsquo;s speedy and has huge windows to view the walls wizzing by the
track.  One time I spent many many minutes riding this train system around,
just watching, and being most intrigued by the way the trains change
direction at the end of the line.  I can hardly describe it, but suffice
that there are great moving metal thingies and electric connectors and all
variety of spooky  subway sunderground stuff.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m at the last stop now.   the end is next.</p>

<p><p>yellow light moving us to the left over a crossing thing that rotates
depending  on the direction of train travel.</p>

<p><p>now at the end with dusy dry tracks and no grease past.  so freaky!</p>

<p><p>Now we&rsquo;re at concourse E again, and this time on the other side of the
tunnel system.</p>

<p><p>Interesting that there&rsquo;s an apparent  branch, but it goes straight under
a cement block wall.  How is that?  does the wall move?  Is it old stuff?
the previous end of the line?</p>

<p><p class=date>13:29</p>

<p><p>on the next plane now.   there were hints of delay, but apparently all is
good and they are trying to get us out on time.  I saw Maia!!  I also saw
Kayle before I knew his name.  I knew he was YRUU from his outfit.  Sloppy
and functional.  A great traveler.   There was a YRUU age girl on the train
at one point, but I dismissed her YRUU-ness because her pants were too clean
and perfect.</p>

<p><p>I don&rsquo;t see Steve F..  I thought he was supposed to be on this flight.</p>

<p><p class=date>13:36  ?</p>

<p><p>oh oh oh and I am sitting right next to the prop.  John and I talked
about how cool it was to sit in these seats with the exact edge on view of
the propellor.  And that&rsquo;s where I am.  In the aisle, but hey.</p>

<p><p class=date>14:05</p>

<p><p>have reached 10,000 feet on our way up to 16,000 feet.  So cool to see
the propellor blades rotate on their attachment axis.  (what&rsquo;s that called?
oh, &ldquo;the pitch&rdquo;)</p>

<p><p>The flight is hardly full; I moved over to two empty seats on the other
side of the plane.  I don&rsquo;t get the direct on view of the prop, but I get
two seats!
<br>And the lovely granola again!</p>

<p><p>In the inflight magazine I found an envelope for <a
href="https://www.snapfish.com">snapfish.com</a> who say they will develop my
film for $1.69 and scan the images online.  Nice!  I&rsquo;ll try them out.</p>

<p><p class=date>14:13</p>

<p><p>I am blessed with two AA batteries that I just found in the seat pocket
in front of me.  I hope I can present them to somebody who needs them.</p>

<p><p class=date>14:17pm</p>

<p><p>Hahahahahahaa!!!!!  In the other seat pocket I found a note written on
the barf bag! It&rsquo;s written with purple marker in 12 or 14 year old girl
handwriting:</p>

<p><p>That is hilarious!!   No date on it though.  Doh!</p>

<p><p class=date>14:30pm</p>

<p><p>the captain just came on the mic, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re about 70 miles outside of &hellip;.&rdquo;
pause &ldquo;tri-cities, and as you can see there is significant thundercloud
activity.&rdquo;   (Actually  I cannot see anything but white fluffy clouds.)
&ldquo;Expect some pretty good bumps on the way in.&rdquo;   Nice.</p>

<p><p class=date>14:33</p>

<p><p>bump dip.  lose the stomach for a bit.</p>

<p><p class=date>15:20pm</p>

<p><p>Late arrival; no more bumps; we had to fly around in a circle until the
weather passed.  Duncan greeted us at the top of the stairs; Kayle went
straight to the bus.  Maia and I are waiting for luggage now.</p>

<p><p class=date>18:02</p>

<p><p>Bus ride was fun; I met Kayle moreso and Mother Staples and Blue
(Stacey).</p>

<p><p>Unloaded the bus and then registration and dinner.  My pic for the
mugbook is of me laying in the flowerbed.  Dinner was great and great
variety!</p>

<p><p>The adults sat together and we talked and pretty much most of the
thoughts that I thought were all brought up.. interesting..</p>

<p><p class=date>18:05</p>

<p><p>HAHAHAHHAHAAHAHAHAAA!!!  The Steering Committee opened the meeting with a
hilarious Beastie Boys  medley!!! Old school B-Boys re-worded with an intro
to the meeting and Steering Committee members.  They reworded &ldquo;Paul Revere&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Girls&rdquo; from Licnesed to Ill.</p>

<p><p class=date>19:38</p>

<p><p>Fun energy break song:</p>

all they did was go like this.

<p><p class=date>19:56</p>

<p><p>Exploring different techniques for how we can do our anti racist
discussions..  there are concerns about logistics and communication.</p>

<p><p class=date>22:50</p>

<p><p> Talking with our touch group now in the hall.. just random BS stuff.  ..</p>

<p><p>The first portion of anti-racism was cool - we described what things we
identify with. These groups were called Identity Groups.</p>

<p><p>Micaela and Ginny(sp) came in during this portion (they had been at the
airport for quite a while) and got big hugs as they joined the group.</p>

<p><p>Carissa said she is going skydiving..</p>

<p><p class=date>22:57</p>

<p><p class=date>23:50</p>

<p><p>I am so tired; it feels so late.  I was falling asleep during worship,
the basis of which we had each individual decorate or write on a small piece
of paper and  place it around a chalice in the center of our circle.</p>

<p><p>Back in the dorms now; Steve F and I have a room together.  About to go
to sleep!</p>

<p><p class=date>12:40am Tuesday 8 August 2000</p>

<p><p>I took a shower and back in our room with the light off so Steve could
sleep, I tried to be all quiet but seemed to bang or drop every conceivable
object in the room.  Steve is hopefully still sleeping.</p>

<p><p>Good night.</p>
