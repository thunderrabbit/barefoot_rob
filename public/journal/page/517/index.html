<p>Katy just asked if I was okay; I hadn't written an
entry in 5 days.</p>

<p>I'm not exactly okay; we are really moving out and
working on selling the house and stuff like that.  A
guy is coming over tomorrow to see if he wants to buy
it; if he does, we don't have to pay a realtor.  So
he's getting a discount price.  Wanna buy a house? 
Email or call me soooon for details.</p>

<p>Last night Wende expressed frustration that I
wasn't helping with the moving out process, which
includes cleaning the house and finding another place
to live.  So today I cruised the internet for a bit
and found an apartment that I like, near my work. 
Darn close.  Walking distance.</p>

<p>I dunno if I'll live there or not; and don't even
know how soon I should move out; it would be a pain to
maintain two "house" payments.  The apartment is a
several dollar savings, so I'd sock away a significant
part of the rest toward my retirement.</p>

<p>So when I told Wende that I had likely found a
place for me to live, she got all quiet on the phone. 
I was like, "what?" and she said that it felt sudden
or something like that.  Not too much I can do to make
things right, it seems.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Couple nights ago, Dude and I took a bunch of
pictures for humanclock.com, but dagnabbit, we should
have checked the website which now shows that they
have a bunch of pics already for the time range we
photographed (11:43pm - 11:57pm)</p>

<p>Our pics were quite creative and unique though - we
took them while standing on or riding the plexiglass
cows of Cow Parade Houston.  We got one cool pic of
the time being reflected in a small pond in Sam
Houston Park in downtown.  Good stuff.</p>

<p>At the end of the night, we visited the dandelion
fountain on Allen Parkway and *<em>just</em>* as we
were poised to take the picture, the fountain turned
off.  Doh!!!!  The water was still dripping thoroughly
from the tubes when the pic was taken.  Funny.</p>

<p>So, since the water wasn't spraying, I got in the
fountain for the pic.   The water was *SO COLD*!!! 
Maybe not for you northerners, but damn it was
freezing to me.  I'm not sure why it was so much
colder than the pond had been, but I'm guessing that
by spraying the water through the air, it cooled it
off a lot more than just by convection.  That's got to
be why.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Tonight our ultimate team had tentative plans to go
to a haunted house, but no one wanted to tonight, so I
was going to go to Astroworld with Jennifer (from
Paint This!) and her friends, but when I called Wende
to ask 'permission,' she wasn't available, and so I'm
not there now, but I'm writing this entry.</p>

<p>By permission I mean making sure that she wouldn't
be totally distraught that I was going and that we
could afford the cost.  Silly, I know.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>At work, my latest project is basically stable,
although I just found a bug with the email-producing
code I had written.  Fortunately I found it before the
emails were sent out.  Took me a moment to figure out
how to adjust the where-clause for the SQL, but I got
it right on the first try. (and by first try, I mean
second try, because it obviously didn't work the first
time I wrote it a few days ago)</p>

<p>I just visited several places downtown on my bike. 
Cool things:</p>

<ol>
<li>I rode *slowly* down a 45 degree steep set of
steps (only 2 feet tall).  I didn't know if I'd be
successful before I attempted.</li>

<li>Rode up to the top of the Rice Lofts parking
garage.  Had to sneak in behind a car to get in. 
(Didn't know how I'd get out.)  I ascended to
determine why a bunch of guys were up on the top
hollering down at some people on the street.
<br>Turns out, they were a running club: <a
href="https://www.h4.org">www.h4.org</a> that runs
random trails on a frequent basis.  Trails are marked
with chalk or flour or some non-permanent thing. 
Interesting stuff.</li>

<li>When I rode down, I built up a great amount of
speed relatively quickly.  Without using my brakes, I
could successfully turn the 180 degree turns about 4
times without wiping out.  I'm thankful for my knobby
tires with knobbies way out on the sides.</li>

<li>The funniest cow I saw as part of the <a
href="https://www.cowparadehouston.com">Cows On
Parade</a> was called <a
href="https://www.cowparadehouston.com/cow/large/999">Steering
Committee</a>.  The picture doesn't quite capture the
funniness; go check it out by the Houston Chronicle
building.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, time for laugh-at-Rob:  Newsflash!</p>

<ul>
<li>We have a federal prison downtown.  It's been
there 2 years.</li>

<li>The Texaco Grand Prix races are over.  The stands
are being dismantled now.</li>
</ul>

<p>See ya!</p>

<p>So briefly:</p>

<p>1) Talked to Meg and Colleen at Subway before the
meeting.  They hollered HI to me as I was walking
toward the church.  Added some silliness to the Aaron
tape.</p>

<p>2) Rally planning meeting confirms Houston Rally
will be the best so far.  I won't give any secrets
away.  We'll have registration forms at San An.</p>

<p>3) Kudos to Katherine for speaking up for youth
empowerment!  I felt quite proud of her.</p>

<p>I have been waiting for the telephone repair guy to
come repair our phone.  Our line is crossed with
Jennifer's next door.  If you call her number, her
phone rings and our phone rings.  We can answer, but
it's all echoey and messed up.</p>

<p>If someone calls our number, no phones ring, but it
will go to our voice mail after 4 apparent rings.</p>

<p>If we call someone from our phone, the caller ID
shows up as Jennifer's number, and after about a
minute of echoey conversation, the phone is
disconnected with a "phone has been left off the hook"
signal.</p>

<p>The phone guy is supposed to be here by 5pm.  I'm
not sure that he's going to make it.  Actually I
believe the problem is supposed to be fixed by
5pm.</p>

<p>I called their repair line and when I enter our
phone number, the voice says it's supposed to be fixed
by October 13th, 2031  (twenty thirty one).  When I
examine our repair status online, it says it should be
ready by 05:00 PM Monday October 13.</p>

<p>When I called earlier today to say, "hey the date
is wrong on the website," the woman said that it shows
up correctly on her screen.  I bet one hundred dollars
that she was just seeing the date and not the day (and
not the year).  I'm calling them again and am
certainly going to try nicely to get someone out here
right now.</p>

<p>I just consulted the calendar function of emacs. 
October 13th in year 2031 is on a Monday.</p>

<p class=date>5:13pm</p>

<p>Boom.  I was correct.  Nicole is now aware of the
problem and is seeing what she can do to get someone
out here soooon.  I haven't yelled at anyone.  But I
did say, "I'm reaaallly not happy."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>While waiting for the phone guy, I wrote a little
auto-index thing in perl for Kim Sawyer's website. 
You can see the prototype <! a target="new"
href="https://www.robnugen.com/cgi-local/poetry.pl">here (2006 update: not!)<! /a>
(should open in a new window).  I wrote these four
sample poems.</p>

<p>Notice that the URL doesn't change when you click
the different links.  It's all using method=post
behind the scenes.  It's a more advanced technique
than what I'm using for my journal entries, for which
the URL changes to determine what journal entry to
view.</p>

<p>I will make it 'prettier' and then move it to his
<a
href="https://www.spiritblueeagle.com">website</a>
soon.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class=date>5:23pm</p>

<p>I'm still on hold.</p>

<p class=date>5:25pm</p>

<p>Now the hold music is gone, but no one is talking;
just silence.</p>

<p class=date>5:28pm</p>

<p>Okay, I just talked to "Mrs Black," who said they
are trying to talk to their repair center and see if
they can get someone out here tonight.  She's going to
call me back within about 30 minutes.</p>

<p>I'm at UH now; I arrived around 10:30 for Ultimate
or Disc Golf.  No one else showed up.  No worries
though; the ultimate field has several inches of
standing water, as do the fairways for the first two
disc golf holes.</p>

<p>So I'm taking a slow walking tour of UH, allowing
the memories to float into my awareness.  I've
progressed across Lynn Eusan park, remembering SPB
concerts including Snow (when he left in the middle of
his set, and was proved to be lip syncing), and the
two different 12 hour Perpetual Park Parties.  Also
when advertising-ridden college game tour things came
through; they were quite fun.  I still have one of
those shirts. Actually Wende has it.</p>

<p>Now I'm in the UC, and there are well dressed
people wandering around, presumably after homecoming..
 that's what it looks like to me.  I remember painting
a poster for Homecoming in 1994.</p>

<p>1994.</p>

<p>I'm off to see the rest of UH now.</p>

<p>Oh, the computer on which I'm composing this entry
is down by the Cougar Den.  It's new.</p>

<p>Hahahhaa!!  How ironic!</p>

<p>It wasn't Homecoming; it was a wedding that
produced such well dressed people.  I went upstairs to
the beautifully remodeled Houston Room and saw one of
the custodian guys chillin' on a couch.  I went over
to say HI and ask what was going on.</p>

<p>Wait-a-minute!  You're no custodian guy, you're Mr
Randy, from KTBZ 94.5 The Buzz!</p>

<p>While he's not on the Buzz morning show Tuesday and
Thursdays, he's mild mannered Randy Wong, event
decorator, owner of A Perfect Event.  At this wedding
he installed all the chair coverings.</p>

<p>We talked for basically the whole time since my
previous entry, however long that was.  How funny!</p>

<p>My tour continues...</p>

<p>What a grand experience!  After writing the entry
about Mr Randy, I headed toward the UC Underground,
which is being remodeled after the storm.  The entire
Campus Activities, Student Program Board, Student
Association, etc are all moved elsewhere.  I didn't
see any indication if they would be back after the
construction is complete.</p>

<p>I did, however, look through the maze of rooms and
marveled at how different was my memory compared to
how the two small auditorium shaped rooms were. 
Somehow I thought they were larger. (One of them was
the room where we watched Jeanine compete in the
Academic Challenge.)  Might have been that I
discovered them from the back AV room, which has
windows overlooking each room.  This AV room was a new
explorational experience for me.</p>

<p>I found some bathrooms that had no walls, but all
the plumbing was fully in place, and I must say quite
confusing, with circular routes, whose purpose I
couldn't determine.  I really wanted to have a camera
to capture that interesting scene.</p>

<p>I progressed back toward where SPB had been, and
found some open doors where normally we find them
locked.</p>

<p>So..</p>

<p>slowly..</p>

<p>cautiously..</p>

<p>creeping...</p>

<p>through this new room, with heavy motors spinning
loudly, maybe pumping steam through the steam tunnels.
 I watched my barefoot steps quite carefully, made
sure I didn't touch <em>anything</em>, and kept close
watch and listen for any approaching people.</p>

<p>I made it as far back as I could without crawling
through 1/2 inch deep water.  Got to a fan for one of the
air vents.</p>

<p>Carefully counted my paces backwards to the steps
that lead out of the UC Underground, and retraced them
forward above ground to see where I had been.  I had made
it as far as "Lover's Leap," which is the name that Marcel
and I gave the air vent that is located in the
sidewalk interesection between the UC Underground, the
Library, the power plant, and the UC Village.</p>

<p>"<em>The UC Village</em>????   What the heck are you
talking about, Rob?"</p>

<p>The UC Village is the name given to a bunch of
not-so-temporary temporary buildings that are in the
middle of what used to be a big field between Melcher
(business school) and the power plant.  According to a
map on the buildings, they are for art students. 
There's one building that has about 20 Dell
workstations, each with a flat screen monitor.  That
room was locked.</p>

<p>Actually all the rooms in the UC Village were
locked except for the restrooms.  (Okay, I didn't
actually try <em>all</em> the doors.)</p>

<p>- - -</p>

<p>I did, however, enter the Engineering building and
check out the concrete boat named Sea Mint before
descending the steps to the lower level of the
Engineering building.  I thought I had never been down
them before, but when I exited by way of outdoor
steps, I remembered that I had.</p>

<p class=date>3:30am</p>

<p>Uh oh, I'm getting tired as I type this.</p>

<p>I next explored through the Architecture building,
and found a set of desks on the top floor that each
seemed to have different types of scales (balances)
built within their space.  I resisted touching any of
them.  Good job me; they were quite tempting.</p>

<p>Walked over to the Satellite, and found a door
propped open down by the main entrance.  I walked
through there, and chose not to walk in toward the
steam tunnels in the back of the Satellite.  (I chose
not to on both sides:  1) where the back of the
restaurants were, and 2) where it apparently connects
to SR1 and SR2.</p>

<p>Very strange to walk through the Satellite through
a whole empty space of nothing but concrete columns
holding up the ceiling, and an occasional firehose
thing hanging from its high pressure pipe from the
ceiling.</p>

<p>I visualized where the gameroom had been, the store
where I bought snacks (lots of trail mix and
Gatorade), and the wide screen TV that often showed
Soap Operas.  I never understood why so many people
watched.</p>

<p>No one was watching now, since there was nothing to
watch but some old plumbing in the old wall-less
restrooms.  I walked passed my chance to go visit SR1,
and found that the back entrance to the Satellite was
wide wide wide open.  I used it as my exit.</p>

<p>Made a quick tour through Social Work to check out
the computer lab, and see if I could squeeze in a
journal entry.  The signage didn't indicate that I'd
have much luck, so I didn't even ask.</p>

<p>Remember back in the day when people would be on
multiple terminals doing the MUDs?  Now there are
multiple people on PCs doing networked 3D shootem-up
games.  Technology progresses while students do
not.</p>

<p>But the coolest thing in Social Work is the
<em>amazing</em> mosaic that greets visitors who enter
the building from Agnes Arnold.  I greeted the mosaic
from "behind" so it took me a moment to discover its
full expanse.  Really super great mosaic!</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I'm falling asleep again.  Just 3 more things:</p>

<p>1) I visited PGH.  Much to my dismay, <em><b>the
second floor of PGH is entirely rebuilt.</b></em>  The
halls are all tiny small, as if for graduate students
only; it looks like some of the top floors.  Now only
3rd floor has the great open halls with the curved
classrooms in the center of the building and large
halls on each end.   Room 209 and 210 as we knew them
are gone.  I cried a bit.</p>

<p>2) I seemed to get over that loss and progress to the 6th
floor, where I discovered Dr Bao's office in its
rightful spot, so I swiped two pieces of paper from the
recycling bin, found a red sharpie in the math
department office, and wrote him a two page letter
giving him an update on life.  Gave him my, Fred's,
and Maggie's email addresses.</p>

<p>3) Exited PGH and went to check out the big Cullen water fountain.
<b>It's empty!!</b> The only water in it is a couple puddles from the
rain.  It looked *so much* like it did 8 or so years ago when I first
started at UH, when we played frisbee in the bottom of the fountain.
Leaves were collected in the corners; some of the underwater lights
were toppled (and not underwater).  The bottom is painted black this
time though, instead of blue as it was 8 years ago.  That's a pretty
big difference.</p>

<p>4) There is water in the shallow wading pool between Eziekiel
Cullen building and the Student Services building.  The landscaping is
different in that they planted a bunch of shrubs and flowers in the
area.  I think it will look quite good when they bloom this
summer.</p>

<p class=date>3:44am</p>

<p>Good night!</p>

<p>One of my goals lately is to get back into creative
stuff.  Artistic expression.  So today I began
painting a plate at Paint This! in the Village.  It's
a plate for Wende.  I have just gotten started on the
slightest of designs.  It kinda sorta looks like a
line drawing of a mushroom with a lake underneath it. 
Once again, I have started without any concept of what
I intend to create.  Just painting a plate.</p>

<p>Jennifer gave me unlimited paint time on my little
card thing.  :-)  Nice.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>This evening I entered some of the accounting
numbers for our investment club.  I need to write a
document that describes how to do the job of
treasurer.  A tiny part of that is written, but not a
lot yet.</p>

<p>I've been listening moreso to the news, and I find
myself less angry at the US for attacking Afghanistan.
 When it happened a few days ago I was sad and
angry.</p>

<p>Now I'm not so mad; I feel almost prepared to go to
war, although that's total BS because *I* am not going
to war. *I* am not a ground troop.</p>

<p>I am extremely thankful for our ground troops to
keep my ass safe here at home.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>This shift makes me wonder if I've been brainwashed
by the news or what.  Verry interesting.</p>

<p>I think it's the anthrax attacks in Florida that
did it for me.</p>
