<p>At my third of three kids classes here at JB, we had a new student, 4
or 5 years older than the others.  The two previously-oldest girls in
the class suddenly stopped messing around and tried significantly
harder than usual.  Such a nice change of pace!  I used a technique I
learned from Tariq: keep having them switch conversation partners and
repeat the same conversation with a new partner.  They gained
confidence each time and it went quite well.  (It helped that there
were 4 students in class today whereas it had always been 3.)</p>

<p>Though I got a seat so I could use my computer to write on the way
home, I got sidetracked by having my hot milk tea bottle fall and roll
under the seat as I was getting out my computer.  Not wanting to
juggle my computer and milk tea, I just ended up using my phone
instead of writing.  Still got a fair bit done, writing to Emmy and
Will.  Thanks, gravity!</p>

<p>I worked on MT3 in two parts today.  Right around 2 hours total, I
think, not including letting glue dry (during which I ate lunch and
had a nice nap).  I found a pretty good technique for keeping the
large marble in place: using a twist tie looped around the track seems
to do the trick.  If I had taken the time to figure that out before I
had the guy push the big marble up the M Splitter, he would have been
able to walk up on both rails.  As it is, he had one foot down and one
foot up, lodged betwen the rail and the marble to keep it from
rolling.</p>

<p>Now, as of the last frame in the video below, the marble is being kept
in place with a twist tie.  I have marked some graduated lines on
Dragonframe to show how far the marble should move between frames.
Should be pretty easy to do the next frames, and if I can get the
timing right, I will have the marble push the white bar into the back
wall, just as a visual gag and exposition of just how massive the big
marble is.</p>

<li>I am training to work at Ty&rsquo;s (headed there now)</li>
<li>I have been transferring the CB backend to SB, where it will be
streamlined / focused on artists and their events instead of
artists and their products.</li>
<li>It has been over a year since I first considered giving up this
laptop for one on which I can run Ubuntu.</li>
<li>The only thing I don&rsquo;t like about this laptop now is the lack of
battery.</li>
<li>I meditated standing up this morning and last night.  By standing,
I was able to remain awake.</li>
<li>I just noticed the funny looking panel (featuring a guy in a yellow
suit) on the train has expanded to
two panels.  I guess it is some kinda campaign.</li>
<li>I have started taking Japanese lessons with Mel who&rsquo;s a native
Japanese speaker who&rsquo;s been willing to look at my homework between
lessons, and whose English is pretty darn good, being that she
lives in the US (and apparently tried hard to learn).</li>
<li>I have gotten positive feedback regarding being a good listener.</li>
<li>I have started doing counseling in my free time before teaching in
西麻布（にしあざぶ）</li>
<li>Lin has been out of town for two nights to see Mikako in 新潟.  I
was planning to go but prep for Ty and sb kept me here.</li>
<li>The owner of Christine&rsquo;s apartment has offered to replace the
carpet with flooring due to some kind of issue they were having
with it.</li>
<li>I used an old envelope I had had with an alpaca / llama sticker on
it to repay people who helped me the day I left my wallet at home.</li>
<li>I have been guiding my thinking with the underlying trust in the
idea &ldquo;the spirit world is real,&rdquo; which I have been hearing more
and more from people I have (casually) interviewed about their
ayajuasca experiences.</li>
<li>I will be taking a course with Soness soon.  She will help me
clarify my message regarding men&rsquo;s group work and personal growth
work in general.</li>
<li>I just learned the first names of けいこさん and さっちゃん
(short for さちこさん), two women who work in a news/snack stand
in the middle of a platform.  They had asked me last week about
being barefoot, and apparently didn&rsquo;t recognized me this week
until they noticed my bare feet.</li>
<li>I just heard a little 4 year old boy refer to himself using 俺（お
れ）, which I still don&rsquo;t use because I think my Japanese isn&rsquo;t
good enough.</li>
<li>日本語を書けますけど、今度これを読めますか？</li>
<li>I am beginning to try reading Japanese paragraphs, but the kanji
still gets me.  I probably can read 200 or so kanji and write 100
or so kanji.</li>
<li>I want to work on open source projects instead of all closed
source stuff.  Welll to be more clear, I want to work on more open
source projects for which I&rsquo;m the maintainer.  I have contributed
to some open source projects, but &hellip; Wait. even as I write this, I
realize I am misrepresenting the situation. I want to be able to
post code / ask questions without having to ask / cleanse the code
first.</li>
<li>Marble Track 3 is pretty open source, but it&rsquo;s hardware, and one
of a kind that will be pretty hard to duplicate.  I did not put a
password on the images, but have not yet figured out how (to
explain how) people can download the images.</li>
<li>Marble Track 3 has entered its fifth month of development (not
including making the cage/barrier to keep Jennie out). I think I
have worked 4.8 days on it, according to the livestreams I have on Youtube.</li>
<li>Just left Noborito.  Gonna change trains at the next station.
Peace out and see ya later, computer.</li>

<p>Been working all morning on sb new admin site.  I got it deployed and
essentially working last night.  Now need to deploy the API, which
should be way less work.  Nate still has not set the Nameservers
though so even when I get it finished, he won&rsquo;t be able to see it
(unless he sets up local /etc/hosts file)</p>

<p>Going to meet Ty soon to figure out this protocol we are developing.</p>

<p>Been working on SB pretty much all day.</p>

<p>All day, though I meditated for 20 minutes and watched Season 2
episode 1 of Lucifer and Season 3 episode 1 of Rick and Morty (for the
nth time).</p>
