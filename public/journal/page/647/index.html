                        <p class=date>17:39 Tuesday 14 September 1999</p>

<p><p><b>STATE OF MY LIFE</b></p>

<p><p><ol></p>

<p><p><li>I love my new job!  I&rsquo;m network administrator for a small company called FSD Data Services.  We have about 15 computers networked, about ten Windows NT 4.0, two Windows 95, and one unix (Free BSD).  Unix box is the email server, one of the windows NT is our web server.  I&rsquo;m slowly crawling up the learning curve hill and loving getting paid to learn this stuff!</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m working about 30 hours per week, have Tuesdays off to do KTRU (9-11am CST (listen on <a href="https://www.ktru.org/realaudio.html">realaudio!</a>)) and whatever else I want to do.  Making $17 per hour which is less than at Telecheck, but I get to wear shorts and T-shirt and run around the office barefoot!</li></p>

<p><p><li>All that happy money is going toward paying of my $9000 debt which I accumulated on credit cards during my 13 months of not working.  Once I&rsquo;m out of debt this time (I got out of $26000 debt after college) I&rsquo;ll more carefully invest some dollars and continue to work for as long as I am happy doing that.</li></p>

<p><p><li>I keep on thinking &ldquo;Road Trip!&rdquo; in my brain.. driving into west Texas somewheres and just playing.  I keep on squawking about this but never do it, and there&rsquo;s tons of references to &ldquo;digital camera&rdquo; in my entries..  The desire is still here; I&rsquo;m not sure why I don&rsquo;t just do it.</li></p>

<p><p><li>I recently finished my scrapbook (not online) of Costa Rica!  Nice feeling to <em><b>finally</b></em> get those damn pictures off my kitchen table and archived nicely in a book on one of my shelves.</p>

<p><p>I have also archived pictures from my two week adventure in Iowa.  Did that just today.  It didn&rsquo;t take as long because I didn&rsquo;t write notes throughout the book naming people or describing the events. We&rsquo;ll see if I ever do that.</p>

<p><p>The goal of all this picture archiving is to clear off my kitchen table. It&rsquo;s a beautiful round wooden table, given to me by Christine&rsquo;s parents some years ago.  I think the table (and I) will be happier with less crap on it.</li></p>

<p><p><li>Over the weekend, Spot, my cat, developed a big lump on his left jaw.  When Fred came in at 8am Saturday, he noticed it.  The lump was bigger on Sunday, and Spot was obviously experiencing pain trying to eat, so we took him to an ER vet clinic.  The girl at the desk said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s an abcess.&rdquo;  The doctor, after poking and proding and listening to Spot&rsquo;s heart and lungs said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s probably an abcess.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>(watch out, it gets gross)
<br>I paid $190.  They knocked Spot out, shaved his left beard, lanced the lump and apparently squirted out 3 ounces of puss-y (pun intended) cottage cheese looking puss.   Mmmmm.. cottage cheese&hellip;</p>

<p><p>By 2pm, Fred had left (after we went to see Ma preach at <a href="https://www.firstuu.org">First UU Church</a> on Fannin (Ma = our mom)) and I went to get Spot, who was only bleeding a bit, and certainly seemed happier.  Soon as I got home, he hopped out of the open car window and I had to grab him before he hopped the fence.  He&rsquo;s an indoor cat for a week or so until he heals.</li></p>

<p><p><li>I have stopped being super active selling FlashNet accounts. That&rsquo;s kind of a misstatement; I was never super active in the first place. But the reason I quit even thinking about being super active is that I just harshed myself for not being active, not making tons of cash, not doing the steps required to make some dollars with FlashNet.  I feel a million times happier now that I have released myself from the need to be successful in that arena.  It feels great!</li></p>

<p><p><li>Today during my day off, I did KTRU (did not violate any FCC rules this week!), went grocery shopping (bought the wrong type of razors), worked on my photo archiving (put New Orleans Rally, Youth Council, and Con Con pics in a book), reviewed a CD for KTRU (number 37 since I&rsquo;ve started as a DJ there in January(?)), and read a bit of a Newsweek magazine that came to my mailbox unexpectedly.  Oh look- it&rsquo;s for the wrong address.  I really just now looked and saw that.</p>

<p><p>But actually, that (it came to my address in error) is interesting.  Magazine arrived, I read the articles on the internet, found a URL for a webcam site <a href="https://www.jennicam.org">jennicam.org</a>.  I visited the site, and found she has some sparse journal entries and was inspired to write this entry.  And now you&rsquo;re reading it!  All because the postal service misdelivered a magazine to my mailbox.</li></p>

<p><p><li>Now I&rsquo;m going to drop off the CD at KTRU and attend a monthly reunion of the Project Heart graduates.  Fun stuff!  I&rsquo;ll write more when I get back.</li></p>

<p><p><li>Wow.  <a href="https://www.jeffdurstconsulting.com/heart">Project Heart</a> (I&rsquo;m not sure if this is the correct URL; the site is not responding) is always great for me!  I&rsquo;m reinspired to continue work on my roller coaster book; I&rsquo;m going to call Astroworld business office and begin a process of interviewing long time employees to uncover the history of Astroworld, especially its coasters!  As &ldquo;just a customer&rdquo; I know a lot about the rides and the park, more than some employees.  I&rsquo;d like to learn more!</li></p>

<p><p><li>That reminds me; I haven&rsquo;t seen Dawn in since whenever that was that Dude and I lunched with her.  But I called her last night just to say HI (HI Dawn!).  We will probably go munch lunch or something sometime soon. Depends on when her next job starts.</li></p>

<p><p><li>I haven&rsquo;t shaved in several days, nor done laundry.  These will happen soon.</li></p>

<p><p><li>I just finished a website for a friend of mine who sells baby blankets from her home.  Check out <a href="https://www.blanketstoyou.com">Blankets To You</a>!</li></p>

<p><p><li>It&rsquo;s now 7:34am Wednesday 15 September 1999, only 108 days until 2000!!!  Do you have plans?  I pretty much don&rsquo;t.  I feel like I&rsquo;ll go skating downtown and/or in Montrose and watch people.</li>
</ol></p>

                        <p class=date>11 September 1999</p>

<p><p>On Friday night around 9pm, my brother Fred left Slidell, Louisiana for Houston to say HI to family and friends before going to Stanford for school.  He drove for a few hours, slept 5 hours, got to my apartment at 8am Saturday.</p>

<p><p>A few hours later, we were at Astroworld.  I&rsquo;ll omit the detail about crappy traffic due to some sporting event at the Astrodome.</p>

<p><p>We both have Six Flags season passes, and we&rsquo;ve both attended several different parks this season.  He&rsquo;s attended more than I, but I did see Six Flags Great America in Chicago while he did not.</p>

<p><p>I had great fun bantering with him in line, talking about coasters and similarities, cool variations, the best, oldest, fastest, newest, most inversions&hellip;  We cracked each other up with old and new jokes and fairly entertained or maybe annoyed the people around us.</p>

<p><p>Started at Serial Thriller, which I&rsquo;ve ridden about 6 times, but he had not yet. I put him in a right hand seat (we didn&rsquo;t wait for front seat) so he could experience the thrill of thinking his leg might get wacked at a particularly close-looking encounter with another part of the track.</p>

<p><p>It was cool, but the line too long for us to wanna ride it again, so we headed to Viper.  Rode Viper about 5 times in a row, usually without waiting for a train, just off then run around and back on same train, or not even have to leave the station and just change seats.</p>

<p><p>Viper begins its descent through a tunnel, and Fred noticed that just outside the tunnel, there is a track that is <em>really</em> close and maybe he could hit it on the way down!</p>

<p><p>He asked one of the ride ops if he could do it (not asking for permission, but if someone could possibly reach the other track).  The ride op didn&rsquo;t know but said, &ldquo;try it!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Around that moment, I got a call on my cell phone.  It was Kristen.  I was all practically yelling, &ldquo;yeah we&rsquo;re at Astroworld and Fred is about to try something cool on Viper!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>While still talking to Kristen, the ride started and I narrated while we rode and described Fred&rsquo;s endeavors.  Down through the tunnel zoom <em>whap!</em> he got it!  &ldquo;Whoo hoo!!&rdquo; we shouted with glee through most of the rest of the ride.  He showed me his hand all greasy smeared and a bit red. We hopped triumphantly off the ride and Fred showed off the grease.  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try it; it hurts a lot.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>As we walked to the next ride, I explained to Kristen everything that had happened, then hung up with her as we skipped Texas Tornado which was out of service probably until Fright Fest in October.  Doh.</p>

<p><p>Then we also skipped XLR8, which was the first suspended ride of its kind when built, but now it&rsquo;s so outdated that I&rsquo;ve heard this is its last season.  I&rsquo;m greatly looking forward to some HUGE and INCREDIBLE coaster in 2000!!!</p>

<p><p>To Greezed Lightnin&rsquo; where we rode it about 8 times in a row, in various seats, in various apparent moods:  &ldquo;Poker Face!&rdquo; and we would sit upright and blank stare straight ahead the entire ride.  &ldquo;Sleep!&rdquo; and we would feign sleep the entire ride.  It&rsquo;s a shuttle loop coaster; the entire ride is only like 35 seconds.</p>

<p><p>While on that ride, we met some woman and her kid, for both of whom this was their first time to ride.  We were all, &ldquo;you gotta put up your hands!!!&rdquo; and we demonstrated for them, waving to the  small crowd that often gathers below the loop. They (new riders) were fun.</p>

<p><p>Then to Batman the Escape, where the line was pretty darn short, but Fred wasn&rsquo;t super impressed with the ride so we only did it once.  Funny thing was Marcel called me and I almost got to talk to him while on the ride but the ride ops wouldn&rsquo;t let me.  Oh well.  One coaster-phone-call is good for a day.</p>

<p><p>Then Ultra Twister, which was ho hum; I&rsquo;m still kinda upset they wasted such an amazing design potential on an essentially 2D track. Fred tried to be all, &ldquo;well it&rsquo;s the first of its kind blah blah blah&rdquo; but I&rsquo;m not really buying it.</p>

<p><p>Then to Texas Cyclone, which we rode once in the front seat of the back car and once in the front seat of the front car.</p>

<p><p>Coolest thing about that is when we got off, they have pictures available that were taken while we were on the ride.  Some kid in the very back seat spray-spat some kind of water just at that moment; it was a very cool effect to see captured on film.  Good timing, man!</p>

<p><p>Then we were pretty much hot and bored, so we left.</p>

<p><p>This time the traffic was even <em>worse</em>, as the same sporting event was now finished and flooded the streets with cars again!  Augh!!</p>

<p><p>We made it out though, and joined Wende for lunch at Taco Bell. Yay!</p>

<p><p>About a week ago, Jennifer and I planned to go to Numbers last night.  &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to Numbers!&rdquo;  &ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Numbers is a dance club in Houston that plays loud tunes to a crowd of 500 to 1000 per night, and sometimes has bands perform.  Music is always wonderfully dance-inducing.  In my case it induces Rob&rsquo;s Crazy Dance.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Rob's Crazy Dance</b>

<p>I don't know how to Swing, or Tango, any country line dances (except The Chicken Dance), or Two Step, or um, any of those dances that I don't know, I can't do.  And I don't really want to.

<p>But I can do Rob's Crazy Dance.  It's not good, or even cutting edge stylish; I just let my appendages flail to the beat.  The faster the music the better; the fuller the sound the better; the louder the better.

</blockquote>

<p><p>KTRU has exposed me to lots of different music besides just rock.  I no longer enjoy just plain ol&rsquo; rock, and especially not grunge, or glam rock or even rock rock.  I love Jungle, Techno, House, Breakbeat, turntablism.. stuff one may hear at raves or parties.</p>

<p><p>En route to Numbers, I had KTRU on.  It was Friday between 10pm to 1am, so KTRU broadcast the specialty show called MK Ultra.  That means that Tejus is in charge of the radio part of the radio, and a rave DJ spins vinyl on turntables.  I tried to call and say whassup to Tejus but the line was busy.  Then he came on the air:  &ldquo;Hey I just got a phone call from ______; there&rsquo;s a Jungle Party going on at 2020 Commerce, featuring DJ <em>something</em> and DJ <em>something else</em>.  Call 713-917-4984 for details.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I said, &ldquo;whoah.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Jen said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p><em>I</em> thought it was a rave. So I described what a rave is like, basically ten times better than Numbers, so we&rsquo;re like forget Numbers, let&rsquo;s go.</p>

<p><p>We arrived, and I soon learned the fine distinction between rave and party.  (I haven&rsquo;t had much experience with either one, but I certainly noticed this distinction.)  This party was at someone&rsquo;s home.  I won&rsquo;t say house; it was one half of a warehouse space.  We walked in and the first room was bare with plywood floor and two big stacks of speakers bumping out beats.  The DJ overlooked this room through an opening that looked like a wet bar, but was too high to be that.  From this room we walked up steps and found a kitchen sink and cabinets built into the hallway, another bare room with exactly one couch and big TV with something Sega being played, and a bathroom.  There was no carpet anywhere, but only plywood nailed firmly as the floor.</p>

<p><p>Jennifer recognized it first, &ldquo;this is someone&rsquo;s <em>house</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p><em>Ahh</em> I thought.  <em>Party</em>.  I&rsquo;m quick sometimes.  Sometimes not.</p>

<p><p>After our quick tour I was like, forget Sega, I came here to dance.  Several people were standing around the edge of the dance floor entry thing, but no one was dancing.  So I danced Rob&rsquo;s Crazy Dance at a moderate level, which is still crazier than most people.  People continued to stream in, and most of them streamed toward the back to talk in the kitchen or watch Sega or whatever.  I commented to Jennifer, who was in the corner watching the whole scene, that it felt pretty odd to be the only one dancing, but oh well.</p>

<p><p>After a while, people slowly collected in the front area and a few began to dance.  This DJ was good, mixing the vinyl well.  I was dancing a higher level of Rob&rsquo;s Crazy Dance. I was excited though, to see the next DJs come in; I hoped they would pump up the beats.</p>

<p><p>The two who had arrived, indicating their DJ status by carrying a big metal case the right shape to hold a lot of vinyl, were both women.  One had dreads right out of Jamaica, the other had straight black hair that reminded me of Cleopatra or some generic Egyptian queen.  Turns out Egyptian girl was the DJ; I never heard her voice.  Jamaican girl was on mic with her English (British)-Jamaican accent encouraging us to party on the dance floor.</p>

<p><p>I didn&rsquo;t need much encouragement from her; this new DJs beats were a million times better than the previous.  Absolutely kickin&rsquo; huge heavy mongo beats with layers and layers of music and high hats tweaked beyond recognition. Incredible. I loved it. Rob&rsquo;s Crazy Dance to the max.</p>

<p><p>The dance floor became relatively packed, compared to what had been there when I started.  Only one other girl had her own crazy dance, which I watched on occasion.  Most people were just kinda wigglin&rsquo;, looking up toward the DJ window booth thing.  I mostly stayed in my own dance world, only looking up when the beats faded into just music for a brief break.  At these points I usually started bouncing with both hands in the air toward the DJ booth, &ldquo;PumpItUp!! PumpItUp!! PumpItUp!! PumpItUp!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>And the beats got even <em>better</em>.  Still the Egyptian hair DJ, with whom by then I had thoroughly fallen in love, and she was spinning some huge beats, with so much bass I could feel my legs vibrating as the bass hit, through the floor and even through the air, blowing my leg hairs around, vibrating my flesh. In<em>credible!</em></p>

<p><p>I actually reached a meditative state, where I literally didn&rsquo;t care/think about what my arms and legs were doing, where I no longer counted beats, anticipating changes.  I was truly in the flow. Rob&rsquo;s Crazy Dance Trance, or Rob&rsquo;s Crazy beyond-the-max-look-out-you-might-get-hit Dance.</p>

<p><p>Finally, I was tired.</p>

<p><p>Jennifer had been dancing some (I was glad she had moved out of the corner), and was up watching the DJ when I determined I was tired.</p>

<p><p>I caught her attention and asked what time it was.  She had no idea.  I went up the steps to say I was ready to go, and to give my new DJ love a hug for playing such incredible stuff.  I waited for her to put new vinyl on, then tapped her shoulder.  She looked up and I mouthed, &ldquo;thank you,&rdquo; and gave her a quick A-frame hug.  It was too loud for me to possibly learn her name, and she was obviously busy.  Jennifer too was ready to go so we went.</p>

<p><p>Outside, &ldquo;do you hear that ringing noise?&rdquo; I joked.  We were both astonished to find it was 1:30am.  It felt like midnight.</p>

<p><p>Jennifer said she had a good time; I had an incredible wonderful time.. a thousand times better than Numbers.</p>

Rob - I met this girl on iCQ last night who lives in Montrose are and
LOVES coasters.  I told her I had a friend that also loved coasters and
would try to hook ya'll up.  she thought it was a great idea.  we ar
emeeting at Mission Burrito today at 11:30am. can you make it?

i hope to see you at lunch.

peace,
Dude
</pre>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s 11:15; I&rsquo;m going and I&rsquo;ll let you know what happens!</p>

<p><p><hr align="left" width="20%"></p>

<p><p>I sat in the glorious weather reading my KTRU DJ manual, taking the KTRU DJ Aptitude Test (KDAT) when Dude walked up.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Did I tell you that I have no idea what she looks like?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Nope.  Do you know her name?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Umm..  Dawn.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I wrote &ldquo;DAWN&rdquo; bigly on a napkin and Dude went to get a burrito. He came back a few minutes later with Dawn.</p>

<p><p>Dawn is cool. She has an awesome travel job, driving to a remote location and testing pipelines for corrosion by hiking along the line. (That&rsquo;s my short version of what she does.)  Dude was like, &ldquo;whoah! you get paid to hike?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>We talked job stuff a lot and then Dude had to leave and Dawn and I talked coaster stuff. My sense is that she loves coasters like I did last year.. loves them, but hasn&rsquo;t been to a lot of parks. I described some of my adventures during the summer armed with Six Flags Season Pass.</p>

<p><p>I had to return to work, so here I am.</p>

                        <p class=date>8 September 1999</p>

<p><p>At work, we have our webserver inhouse.  The machine, whose name is Mickey (I always think of the Toni Basil (sp) song), hasn&rsquo;t been regularly maintained because no one wanted to shut down our web server.   Mickey needed two things fixed:
<br>1) update from Service Pack 3 to Service Pack 5
<br>2) mirror the disk drive with another drive</p>

<p><p>Looking at our web traffic statistics, I saw clearly that we have small traffic after business hours, so I figured we could easily shut it down at night and make the updates.</p>

<p><p>I felt confident in my ability to install Service Pack 5, but I wasn&rsquo;t so sure about mirror disks, so I called in super smart friend John to help with that.  John brought Maggie, since her car had a flat tire and they were on their way home from work.</p>

<p><p>What I did <em>not</em> do, however, was make sure my boss was cool with me having a &ldquo;guest&rdquo; (or two) in the office after hours, much less having someone else mess with the machines. When we arrived at like 6:30, no one else was there.  Whew.  So far so good.</p>

<p><p>We shut down Mickey (&ldquo;oh Mickey, what a pity you have to get the boot&rdquo;) and a few seconds later a different machine beeped, &ldquo;hey! where&rsquo;d the webserver go??&rdquo;  This nosey machine, named Tramp, can page or send email when the webserver has a problem.</p>

<p><p>Oops!!  So I shut down Tramp&rsquo;s webserver monitor and hoped that no page had been made, nor email sent.</p>

<p><p>I called my bosses at this point to keep them from wondering what was going on (if in fact they even knew the server was down)  Boss 1 wasn&rsquo;t home (was he on his way to the office???)  Boss 2 was like, &ldquo;no problem, thanks for calling!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Few minutes later, someone dialed in to Tramp; it was Patrick, not a boss, but someone I hadn&rsquo;t called.  Hmmm.  So I sent him a message that popped up on his screen</p>

<p><p><pre><center>
HI - this is Rob; I&rsquo;m adding
Service Pack 5 to Mickey.&rdquo;</center></pre></p>

<p><p>We kept working.  And actually at this point we were just trying to figure out why Windows wouldn&rsquo;t recognize the other disk drive.  The SCSI controller could see it; the SCSI IDs were set correctly, but Windows wouldn&rsquo;t recognize it.</p>

<p><p>We gave up on that at like 8:40 and decided to install Service Pack 5.  This finished with no problem at around 9pm.</p>

<p><p>The drive still wouldn&rsquo;t come up.</p>

<p><p>So that was it.  No one came in, &ldquo;aha!  you have unauthorized guests!&rdquo;  Instead, we left for Chinese dinner at Hunan Dragon.</p>

<p><p>It has come to Jason and my attention that we won&rsquo;t be able to get the cash necessary for our big trip down under by November.</p>

<p><p>Maybe we can plan a smaller excursion, or a shorter one, or something.  But for right now, we&rsquo;ll be right here in the greater Houston area.</p>

<p><p>Today started a new semester at KTRU.  My new shift is now Tuesdays from 9am to 11am.</p>

<p><p>This is my first semester with only a 2 hour shift!  Holy cow it went by so quickly today!</p>

<p><p>The coolest thing is that at 9am, no one is on before me, so I get to turn on the station in the morning.  So check it out each Tuesday at 9am CST (<a href="https://www.ktru.org/ktru.html">www.ktru.org</a>) and you can hear me make the official Sign On Announcement about the station and 50,000 watts and all that.</p>

<p><p>No one called me today at the station, well except for one person, but she was trying to reach someone else.  Oh well.</p>

<p><p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll have a contest this next Tuesday for free bumper stickers!!</p>

<p><p>Oh!!! And the funniest thing!  I gave the opening announcement and then was all, if you have any requests, call 713-___  and I gave <em>my</em> phone number!  No one called; apparently no one was listening.  Good thing because I said, &ldquo;holy shit that&rsquo;s my number!  Ooops I&rsquo;ll just stop talking now and play a song.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>That (saying &ldquo;shit&rdquo;) was my first FCC violation and I could be fined up to $10,000 dollars and be imprisoned for up to 2 years.  Doh!!</p>

                        <p class=date>7 September 1999</p>

<p><p>Yesterday we went to Waterworld, the wet and wild theme park next to Six Flags Astroworld.  (We in the above sentence = me, Jennifer, Charyl, Mark, Lynn, and Kyle.  Charyl organized the trip; she had some extra free tickets from something else.  I have my season pass, so I invited Jennifer.  Anyway, we all went.)</p>

<p><p>There&rsquo;s a pretty cool slide there - 90 feet tall and nearly straight down at first, with a smooth transition to flat at the bottom.  I and the three girls went down that, but Mark and Kyle politely declined.  Kyle openly expressed his fear.</p>

<p><p>Some of the park employees went down the slide, and I was super envious that they got to go down head first.  I begged the various life guards during the day to let me go down head first, but none let me.  It wasn&rsquo;t worth getting kicked out of the park to do it, so I didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p><p>I did, however, tread water for 15 minutes (in two intervals), including 10 minutes while the big waves were pouring from the back of the wave pool.  How do they make those waves?  Big giant paddles behind the wall?  Very interesting to me, that.</p>

<p><p>As a group we went to The Big Red Slide, which turned out to be <em>fabulous</em> fun.  All six of us could ride at once down in these big innertube things, and the walls were all curvy and we would whooosh!!  way up on the side and the person at the top of the turn would almost fall onto those at the bottom.  We yelled and had a great time twice down this ride.</p>

<p><p>We also spent a significant amount of time climbing all over a giant climby splashy maze of netting and tubes and tunnels and water hoses and buckets and squirt guns and had a crazy fun time.  Every couple of minutes, a giant bucket at the very top would be tipped over and a huge torrent of water would flood the entire thing, much to the excitement of everyone climbing all over.</p>

<p><p>Unfortunately, one of my favorite water slide things was &ldquo;broken,&rdquo; according to a life guard.  It was a lazy stream of slides and pools where people in innertubes like blood cells would float toward the bottom.  From the Big Red Slide steps, I could see portions of the broken slide filled with pine needles instead of water.</p>

<p><p>Fun was had by all for several hours.  We pretty much got tired and changed and headed back to our cars just in time before a tremendous deluge of rain covered the whole city for a few minutes.  Yay us!</p>

                        <p class=date>15:46 Saturday 21 August 1999</p>

<p><p>Last night (and every Friday night) KTRU broadcast MK Ultra show - 3 hours of live DJs mixing jungle or techno or breakbeat or any basic rave music.  I love the show so I go to watch the DJs spin and basically just think, &ldquo;wow! [I wonder if I would enjoy spending enough time to get that good?]&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Last night Chris Anderson was spinning; he&rsquo;s big in the Houston rave scene and maybe way bigger than that; I know he&rsquo;s spinning in Santa Fe tonight.</p>

<p><p>So he&rsquo;s just echelons beyond me in all aspects of the skillz, but I enjoyed watching and talking to him.  All the DJs I&rsquo;ve talked to just said, &ldquo;practice.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Turntables are an integral part of this &ldquo;practice&rdquo; so I&rsquo;m thinking, &ldquo;where do I get turntables?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p><hr align="left" width="15%"></p>

<p><p>At 12:50am, 10 minutes before the show was to end, Eric arrived to cover his 1 to 4am shift.  This surprised me because I was at the station exactly to cover for him (he had sent an email requesting a sub for his show; I was going to be at the station already, so I said yes).  This surprised him because he hadn&rsquo;t gotten my response to his request.</p>

<p><p>So we both stayed.</p>

<p><p>Eric and I had <em>so much <b>fun</b></em> cutting up laughing, cutting up vinyl and CDs, experimenting with sounds and stuff; it was great!</p>

<p><p>We took turns at the console; encouraging each other, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re doing great!&rdquo; and just generally having fun.</p>

<p><p>I mixed up DJ Silver &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Panic&rdquo; with Francis Dhomont &ldquo;Scherzo&rdquo;, which simply don&rsquo;t mix at all, but was great fun to experiment.  We&rsquo;ll bring tapes next week to record the fun for later playback.</p>
