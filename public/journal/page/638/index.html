<p><p>Nothing amazing lately&hellip;</p>

<p><p>Yesterday at work I installed backup software on our big server.  (See
how boring this entry is?)   Today I haven&rsquo;t really been working, which is
fine, but means no $ for today really.  I will take an inventory of all our
computers here at work and then I&rsquo;ll feel productive!</p>

<p><p>Then I may go to KTRU and check out a CD for review.</p>

<p><p>Went to Project Heart reunion meetin&rsquo; last night and said HI to peoples
and Amanda; figured out some Things To Do to help clean up my apartment.
 (It really is looking cleaner lately; Wende got me 2 recycling bins from
Container Store and I&rsquo;ve been throwing away stuff or finding an appropriate
place to file it)  Someone at the meeting was all, &ldquo;if it doesn&rsquo;t support
you or nurture you, get it out of your life (including people).&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Oh!  I know..  this weekend is Houston Rally!  But I have planned no
part of it and I almost know nothing about it.  I haven&rsquo;t seen the T-shirt
design; I didn&rsquo;t even know they had T-shirts made until last night when
someone asked how many they should order!</p>

<p><p>Last 3 years I was heavily involved with planning, but not this time;
I&rsquo;m stepping away from local advising.  But I&rsquo;ll still attend, of course,
as a district advisor.</p>

<p><p>With Love
<br>- Rob</p>

<p class=date>11:53pm CST Sunday 9 January 2000</p></p>

<p><p>This evening, after Taco Bell, Wende and I drew out some house designs.  We&rsquo;ve jokingly said, &ldquo;if we get married, we&rsquo;d have to have to separate living areas &ndash; two separate everythings&hellip;&rdquo;  So we drew some designs tonight.  She spent a lot more time on one design; I whipped out a few quick ones and then drew one somewhat well.</p>

<p><p>Not ready to see an architect, yet.  Plus, we are still developing our million dollars to pay for it!</p>

<p><p>Back to work tomorrow.  Big big project we are starting.  It actually begins tonight as my boss has started the process of sending out 7 or 8 thousand emails to people so they can log on to our website.</p>

<p class=date>12:33pm CST Sunday 9 January 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Ultimate last night was great fun.  We played three games and I made 2 or 3 great catches and maybe 2 great throws.  Maybe 1 great throw.</p>

<p><p>My great catches were just lunge grabs just before disc hit the ground and then a lovely roll across my back from right shoulder to left hip to up on my feet!</p>

<p><p>My great throws were perfectly placed forehand tosses for points.</p>

<p><p>There was one other great thing I did, but I don&rsquo;t remember now.</p>

<p class=date>6pm Saturday 8 January 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Today some friends of mine and I began the formation of an investment
club.  We are just in the process of hammering out our by-laws and
stuff, so I don&rsquo;t have much to tell you about it yet.  However, we
elected some officers, and I&rsquo;m the treasurer!  Pretty cool; I get to
create reports of our fundage and individuals&rsquo; contributions.</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;ll meet monthly and work together to research stocks and hopefully
double our dollars in 5 years.  Hopefully 10X our dollars in 5 years,
but official we hope for doubling.</p>

<p><p>If you&rsquo;d like to start your own investment club, visit <a

<p><p>Ultimate frisbee tonight!</p>

<p class=date>1:34pm Friday 07 January 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Yesterday and today at work we&rsquo;re pretty much just doing final
preparations and testing for our big data-receiving project starting
Monday.  I finished installation of SAS on our new machine (named TORI
(after Tori Amos)) which will process data that&rsquo;s emailed to us.</p>

<p><p>Today I&rsquo;ve been banging the hell out of the process.  Flooding it with
emails, giving it bad data, giving it incorrect filenames and file types,
more bad data, more bad data, stomping it and it&rsquo;s handling everything
fine.  Some schools of thought say therefore I&rsquo;m not trying hard enough.</p>

<p><p>After work and stuff yesterday, Wende and I watched
<em>Multiplicity</em> starring Michael Keaton, Michael Keaton, Michael
Keaton, &amp; Michael Keaton.  Pretty cute movie.  We laughed at a couple of
scenes.</p>

<p><p>At the mushy part at the end, I was all, &ldquo;wait where are the kids?  Wait
how did that happen?&rdquo;   Wende was all, &ldquo;hush!!&rdquo;   She was into it.  :-)</p>

<p><p>Turned in another CD to KTRU today.  It was a band called Eason, CD
called <em>Via Satellite</em>. Bluh.  terribly depressed sound.  I swilled
it.</p>

<p><p>Today we&rsquo;re going to watch <em>Toy Story 2</em>!!!</p>

<p><p><em>Toy Story 2</em> was great!!  Beautiful animation and ray tracing, fabulous camera angles, great characters and hilarious scenes!</p>

<p><p>I laughed to tears at one scene, where Mr Potato Head puts on his Angry Eyes.  That was hilarious!!</p>

<p><p>The Star Wars scene was a bit too predictable, but the outtakes at the end made up for that.  Outtakes for animataion!!!</p>

<p><p>Only one thing I missed: outtakes that involved toys and human characters.  I think that would have given stronger magic to the show.  I dunno.</p>

<p class=date>4:49pm Wednesday 5 January 1900</p></p>

<p><p>KTRU was great today!  We have a new phone system; I got to do an EAS
(Emergency Alert System) test; and I learned the <em>correct</em> level to
use for the microphone.</p>

<p><p>Most fun of all that is the new phone system.  The phones have caller ID
(except it doesn&rsquo;t display until <em>after</em> I answer the line (maybe
I&rsquo;ll figure out a way around that)) and our new phone number spells KTRU!
713-348-KTRU, which (I also happily announced) spells 713-FIT-KTRU so
listeners can fit their schedule to listen to KTRU!  Wheee!!!</p>

<p><p>For the EAS test, I put on a long song called &ldquo;Standby&rdquo; which seems
somewhat appropriate so I could say &ldquo;stand by for this test.&rdquo;  The song was
not made worse having a test in the middle.</p>

<p><p>And finally, I learned that I need to raise my mic level or my voice is
not properly picked up on RealAudio.  Thanks to Will, our station manager,
for letting me know that!</p>

<p><p><hr align=left width=20%></p>

<p><p>Between KTRU and work, Wende met me at work with some lovely Taco Bell.
 She paid for it by returning the glass milk bottles to Kroger for $1 per
bottle.  Together, we had collected 13 bottles.</p>

<p><p><hr align=left width=20%></p>

<p><p>In other news, at work today I finally got the third and final machine
up and running with Windows NT 4.0 Server!  The problem during my first
installation attempt:  A faulty keyboard.  Yup.  Remember?  I pressed S and
it didn&rsquo;t respond at all?  That was it.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ll be exchanging a few parts to the computer place tomorrow.</p>

<p><p>Oh, and the cool thing about this new server: it is the Primary Domain
Controller for our new domain.  (Windows NT domain, not Internet domain)
 We&rsquo;ll be migrating to have 2 separate domains - one public and one
private.  Nice! :-)</p>

                        <p><title>Futurama</title>
<p class=date>11:27pm CST Tuesday 4 January 3000</p></p>

<p><p>Today on the way home I saw the big KRIV FOX 26 tv station. I was immediately reminded that Futurama (my new favorite show) seemed to be conspicuously missing at 7:30 after The Simpsons on Sunday.  So I stopped by to ask what was up.</p>

<p><p>They were closed, and the lights were off in the office thing, but the front doors were unlocked.  In the lobby I found a small sign</p>

<p><p><pre></p>

<pre><code>                 After Hours
                 Dial 7215
</code></pre>

<p></pre></p>

<p><p>I picked up the phone and dialed.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Security.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What happened to Futurama?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Futurama!  It used to play on Sunday night, and last Sunday it wasn&rsquo;t on.  I saw the TV station and figured that if anyone knew, you would know.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hang on for just a minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>While on hold, I noticed the lights come on in the office and a man walked in.  He slid open the glass window and presented the Schedule For 01-03-00.</p>

<p><p>No Futurama.</p>

<p><p>Bluh!  I asked if he could give me the office phone number, which he did, so I will maybe call them tomorrow.  Maybe not though; I can&rsquo;t seem to find the number already.</p>

<p><p>I really loved Futurama!!!!!</p>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s FREEZING tonight!!  It&rsquo;s like 42 degrees outside now, and it&rsquo;s predicted to freeze.  I guess I&rsquo;ll wear pants tomorrow.</p>

<p><p><hr></p>

<p><p>Picked up Scott from the Toyota place, and the guy suggested that of all the repairs, the radiator was most critical.  He gave me a phone number for a place that he said would do a good inexpensive job replacing it.  Nice.</p>

<p><p>Drove home with no problems.  I&rsquo;m going to get some second and maybe third opinions on it; we&rsquo;ll see how it goes!</p>

<p class=date>7:30am 04 January 2000</p>
Scott, my car, is in the shop.  He was leaking oil; I think I mentioned that, so I took him in on Thursday evening.  You read yesterday about how they had me on hold and all that, well I got the message back last night:</p>

<p><p><ul>
<li>power steering rack for main steering is leaking fluid - $840
<li>valve cover gasket leaking oil- $110
<li>distributor mounting seal leaking oil - $118
<li>front engine oil pump seal - $395
<li>motor mounts are bad - $624
<li>radiator top tank cracked and leaking - $365
<li>lower control arms (A-frame ball joint bushings) - $690
<li>alignment - $76.50
<li>leak in rear main seal (maybe; can&rsquo;t tell because of other leaks) - $675
<li>Total cost: $3893.50 + tax
</ul></p>

<p><p>When I bought Scott, he cost $5300.  I love my little car.  I want to get him fixed correctly.  Last night, Wende has suggested that I take him to a different (not car dealership) place that we trust to get a second opinion.</p>

<p><p>I had one other idea this morning: call Sam Malone.  Sam is an wildly popular radio personality in Houston who often does ads for the car place where Scott is.  He often will help people with monetary situations such as this.</p>

<p><p>I called and talked to Psycho Robbie who suggested that I contact Sam after the show through the main desk of the station.  I will let you know how it goes!</p>

<p><p>With Love

<p><p>I called Sam Malone and left a voicemail.  He called me back!</p>

<p><p>(Just to hear our office manager, &ldquo;Rob, Sam Malone is on line 2 for
you,&rdquo; was pretty awesome!)</p>

<p><p>He said he didn&rsquo;t want to step in immediately; he wasn&rsquo;t there; hasn&rsquo;t
seen the car; etc, but to call Mike or Randy directly, and to call him
(Sam) back; he would be in the office until 11:30-ish.</p>

<p><p>I called Mike, left a voicemail.</p>

<p><p>I called Randy, talked to him directly, and he said he would look and
either Stuart or Randy would call me back!</p>

<p><p>I am so happily optimistic!</p>

<p><p>With Love
