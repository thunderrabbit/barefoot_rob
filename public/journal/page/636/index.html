<p><p>Rally begins tonight!!  This time in Dallas, a relatively short-ish
drive once we get out of Houston traffic.  We&rsquo;re leaving at 7pm &ndash; Wende
and I driving separate vehicles full of youth.  Big big fun!!</p>

<p><p>I hope I&rsquo;ll be able to write some during the weekend.</p>

<p><p>Yay!!</p>

                        <p>Rob -</p>

<p>Magnetism and time have no first-order relationship.</p>

<p>Magnetism is exactly the vector cross component of the electric field - the
forces are inexorably tied to each other, and it is virtually impossible to
have one without generating the other.</p>

<p>Gravitation and time are tied via General Relativity.  Most folks are
familiar with Special Relativity, the &ldquo;speed of light and you don&rsquo;t age&rdquo;
idea.  General Relativity describes the distortion of space around a large
gravitational body or field.  Distortion of space, by the constant nature of
the speed of light, requires a distortion in time as well.</p>

<p>Light is photons (energy), which neither have mass nor force (not completely
true, but it has to do for now).  Light isn&rsquo;t directly tied to electricity,
magnetism, or gravity except as energy released by the first two.</p>

<p>Magnetism and gravity ARE related in some as yet undetermined way.  We have
not been able to generate energy levels high enough to unify these forces.
For example,</p>

<p>Electricity + Magnetism = Electromagnetic force (&ldquo;room temperature&rdquo;)</p>

<p>Electromagnetic Force + Weak Nuclear Force = Electro-Weak Force
(very high energies)</p>

<p>ElectroWeak + Strong Nuclear Force = Unified Force
(very, VERY high energies)</p>

<p>Unified Force + Gravity = Grand Unified Force and Theory of Everything
(basically you need an accelerator the circumference of Saturn&rsquo;s orbit to
get this).</p>

<p>Combining the Grand Unified Force and General Relativity, the possibility
exists for a tenuous relationship between time and magnetism&hellip; but don&rsquo;t
count on ever being able to calculate it.</p>

<p>Hope this answers your question.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m very excited about <em>The TIGGER Movie</em> coming on the 11th!!</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ve recently taken apart some hard drives and found some kick ass
magnets in them.  As a result, I suddenly have the following questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Are magnetation and time related?

<li>Aren't gravitation and time related?   I think so if time gets warped 
around black holes.

<li>Isn't light "more closely related" (as far as we know) to magnetism 
than gravity?
</ol>

<p><p>I asked my smart friend John these questions.  If his answer is
interesting, I&rsquo;ll put it in here.</p>

<p><p><hr align=left width=20%></p>

<p><p>A couple of nights ago I was practicing on my (borrowed) unicycle, and I
was able to go from behind my apartment, down the driveway ramp and into
the street!!  The ramp is a significant slope - 20 degrees for about 20
feet I&rsquo;m guessing.  I&rsquo;m getting better!!!!</p>

                        <p><title>Snail Mail</title>
<p class=date>9:29pm CST Sunday 30 January 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Today on my lovely day off from work, I began to clear off my Blue Table.  It&rsquo;s more like a folding desk thing, but it works as a table.  Anyway, it&rsquo;s been covered in papers and crap for a pretty long time.  Today I converted it to a snail mail letter writing table!  Ah, snail mail, that long lost friend connector of the 80s&hellip;</p>

<p><p>I had written a couple of letters on Christmas day, but didn&rsquo;t have addresses for the recipients.  I did some searching through my old stuffs and found the addresses, and found some near ancient addresses for other peeps who I haven&rsquo;t written since back in the mid 1990s!!</p>

<p><p>Most interesting of these was finding my friend Patti from high school.  I attended Tomball; she attended Jasper, and we met because our marching bands hung out together at competitions and stuff.  We never dated, but we sent hundreds of letters back and forth and back and forth over a period of what&hellip; 3 or 5 years??  Most fun part of that was drawing little episodes of The Spike and Wilbur Show, starring Spike and Wilbur, little cartoon dog and cat respectively.</p>

<p><p>I had been in touch with her via phone like 5 years ago, but lost her again since then.  Today I decided to call Jasper information and try to find her parents.  There were 4 listings with her last name.  I requested the 3rd and 4th ones.  I called the 3rd one first, and <em><em>bing</em></em> it was her dad!!!!</p>

<p><p>Super awesome!!  I gave him my name and number; he&rsquo;ll call her and relay the information.</p>

<p><p>Funny thing:  3 or 4 minutes after I hung up with him, my phone rang.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;  (me)</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Rob?&rdquo;  (her)</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Patti?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This is Colleen.  I have a question for you&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Hahahahahha!!!  One of my lovely youth.  (Rob, calm down.)</p>

<p><p>Okay.</p>

<p><p>With Love
<br>- Rob</p>

<p><p>I have just completed the new improved <a href="https://www.blanketstoyou.com">www.blanketstoyou.com</a> website!  Now we have a real live shopping cart instead of the silly HTML form thing I had made.</p>

<p><p>Also today I did 6 loads of laundry, plus a &ldquo;load&rdquo; that consisted of just my comforter.</p>

<p><p>It is SO COLD!!!!! I had been basking in glorious 80 degree weather just a week ago and now it&rsquo;s 40 someodd degrees!!!!</p>

<p><p>I have a new Perl project brewing in my brain: a web based cash manager thing like Quicken.  I would just use Quicken, but they don&rsquo;t have a version that works on Linux.  <a href="https://www.gnucash.org">https://www.gnucash.org</a> has been&hellip;</p>

<p><p>Well I&rsquo;ll be dinged.  Last time I checked, <a href="https://www.gnucash.org">gnucash.org</a> had nothing on their site but a &ldquo;coming soon&rdquo; message.  I&rsquo;m downloading their thingie now.</p>

<p><p>If I don&rsquo;t like Gnu Cash, I&rsquo;ll still write my perl thing.</p>

                        <p><title>Past Life Regression</title>
<p class=date>19 January 2000</p>
<p class=note>(transcribed from audio tape)</p></p>

<p><p>Being regressed to past lives is simple.  While I was in a relaxed state (not sleeping), Lilly simply guided me to a &ldquo;place&rdquo; and asked me to describe it to her.  She asked questions to help guide my focus.</p>

<p><p>Even during the experience, I was aware of my physical body, aware of her cat jumping over the child-gate into the room&hellip; I wasn&rsquo;t all zombied out like hypnotized on TV.</p>

<p><p>Here is the transcription of the regression.  [comments in square brackets are mine now as I type it.]<br />
<br>(comments in parenthesis and other &hellip; punctuation attempt to capture pauses, in speech.)</p>

<p><p>As the text begins, I have just been mentally led through a visualization out of the chair, into a limo, out of the city, into the country, through a fog, out of the limo, walk across a bridge through more fog, then the fog clears:</p>

<p><p>================================</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> What does it look like to you here?  is it an open
area?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> Open trees around grassy area.  oak type trees tall
with fluffy tops, not like pine trees
<br>thick grass in the middle very long, very pristine
clean</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> so you&rsquo;re not walking along the path?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> I fell asleep crossing the bridge and woke up standing
in this field.
<br>I don&rsquo;t see anything particularly adventuresome here.</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> what time of the day do you think it is?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> Noon.</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> and do you have a sense of what season of the year it
is?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> summer to autumn.  the growing season is over</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> the growing season is over?
<br>how old do you think you are?  how old do you feel?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> 18 - 20</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> and where are you heading?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> I&rsquo;m just outstanding in my field.  [pun intended, though Lilly missed it or ignored it.]<br />
<br>no destination really.</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> is this place a familiar place to you?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> at first I thought it was the location of my previous
encounter with past life experience
<br>civil war, but there is no battles it&rsquo;s very peaceful
and calm.  very beautiful.  i don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s the
same place or not.</p>

<p><p>[At this point I am certain that I&rsquo;m not in a past life.  I&rsquo;m certain this past life stuff is just my imagination, but I still follow her lead and trust the process.]</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> if it is, it seems like it&rsquo;s earlier.  I&rsquo;m not sure that it is.
<br>are you still just standing there</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> is there a clearing or is there just woods around you?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> we&rsquo;re in a clearing very grassy like 100 uh 70 yards
across and thick woods all around.  turn around and I
see the path and bridge; I can walk back.  climb down
into the creek underneath the bridge  rocky big not
not soft uh smooth rocks not a lot of water but enough
that it is flowing some and
it feeds around toward the left as if around the
clearing with big trees all around it.</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> are you just walking down the creek now</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> yeah I can easily jump from rock to rock and not get
wet. perfect balance</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> do you live close to here?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> yeah.  this is where I play a lot.
I&rsquo;ve never ventured this far along the creek before. I
usually come, stop this far and don&rsquo;t venture past
this.</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> why don&rsquo;t we go back?  we can always come back here.
<br>is that okay with you?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> I&rsquo;m back up on the bridge by the clearing</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> which way is your house?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> back toward the left along the bridge</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> can you see your house?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> no</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> it&rsquo;s kind of a ways away isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> yeah</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> do you feel like going back there or would you like to
continue down the creek</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> I can take the creek the other direction and it curves
like a circle around the clearing; I don&rsquo;t have a
sense that it goes anywhere</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> why do you come to this spot so often?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> it&rsquo;s beautiful and peaceful, no one really bothers me
or knows about it.</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> where is the rest of your family?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> all back at the house</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> what are they doing?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> I don&rsquo;t know really.  they just work, work the fields
and some livestock.  It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me now why I don&rsquo;t know what they do.
<br>[I think I made it all up.]</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> maybe it&rsquo;s not important.</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> yeah</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> how soon did you leave this place?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> I don&rsquo;t understand the question.</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> did you leave this place very soon or did you continue
to live here?
<br>did you go on an adventure?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> no answer.</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> okay.
<br>and what are you doing now?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> thinking that I&rsquo;m not in any past life</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> you think you&rsquo;re just in a very relaxed place?</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> Let&rsquo;s move on to another place.
<br>In that life I&rsquo;d like you to close your eyes, and I&rsquo;m
going to count forward from 1 to 3.
and as I get to three, I&rsquo;d like you to open your eyes
in another life. and try to keep them closed in this
one you&rsquo;ll be in a very different place.  here we go
1. 2. 3.</p>

<hr />

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> where do you seem to be Rob?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> lots of rocks.  rocky road or path looking down over the mountain type area</p>

<p><p>[this change was so dramatic - very surprising in a way.]</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> different rocks than before</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> whole terrain is different .. climate is drier.</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> is it a very wide road?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> about enough for one cart, plus a man on each side and still have no one fall off the road.</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> this must be a pretty high mountain.</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> yeah</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> what&rsquo;s the season of the year here?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> like spring having come out of winter</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> is it pretty cool?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> not really.  I think I&rsquo;m bundled up.</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> are you carrying anything?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> no just walking down the mountain road.</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> where does the road go to?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> down the road to the closest town village city thing
so I can buy stuff for the family.</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> what are you going to go buy?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> I think spices.  some&hellip;  to be used for cooking or.. or healing</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> what did you just encounter?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> nothing</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> is this a regular time of year that you go to this town or do you go frequently?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> just whenever it&rsquo;s necessary to go.</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> you seem older here.</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> yeah.  38.</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> are you the head of the household?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> I think so.  I&rsquo;m sort of acting in that capacity.</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> have you gotten to the town yet?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> yeah um.. lot of activity, horses, men.  mostly people don&rsquo;t know who I am or don&rsquo;t pay attention. and I have a few coins.  they&rsquo;re .. they&rsquo;re very primitive and .. I can buy small sack of .. I don&rsquo;t get a sense of what it is.</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> like a.. like what, the shape of what is now a fireworks stand.  there&rsquo;s no inside except where the people work.  I stand outside it&rsquo;s covered.  need to buy a bag of something.</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> and did someone send you to buy this bag or are you buying it on your own?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> my wife sent me.</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> is she the one who does the healing?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> yeah.  she knows what she&rsquo;s doing more than me.  she.. she.. it&rsquo;s more like she takes care of me, and I just do things she tells me to do.  she just tells me what to do.</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> is she kind of like a local healer for the area?  or does she just work on you?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> I don&rsquo;t think so..  on occasion maybe.</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> not normally.</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> no</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> do y&rsquo;all have children?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> we had some but they&rsquo;re gone.</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> where have they gone to?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> one of them died in a battle and I don&rsquo;t remember about the other.</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> and what else are you doing in town besides buying this sack of stuff?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> just seeing all the horses, wonder if I could ride one, if I could own one what it would be like.  it would certainly be faster to go up the mountain.</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> how long does it take you to go back home?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> most of the afternoon to get to the town and back.  a couple hours.</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> how do you feel here?  do you feel good here?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> not really much emotion.  I feel taken care of.  I don&rsquo;t have to think much. just do what I&rsquo;m supposed to do.  it&rsquo;s easy enough.  and I um have a craving for adventure, but that&rsquo;s not me this time.</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> so you stay there your whole life in that area.</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> yeah.  I die peacefully in bed</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> did you live to be very old?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> not real old.  48 I think.</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> and my life just went on without me.</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> she sounds like she was a very self sufficient person.</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> yeh.</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> let&rsquo;s move on to another one.  let&rsquo;s move to one where there is more activity, more people around you.  not so much the loaner.  so once again, in that lifetime, I&rsquo;d like you to close your eyes, and I&rsquo;m going to once again count from 1 to 3 and when I get to 3 you can open your eyes in that lifetime.  1. 2. 3.</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> On a ship.  sailing vessel.  like pirates.  with um, I&rsquo;m like deck hand with ripped short clothing, big hands, very strong to pull the ropes.  I&rsquo;m not the captain, but I&rsquo;m well liked by the captain, I&rsquo;m a good worker.  I get to sit by him at eating times, sometimes, but not always, and we sail for days.</p>

<p><p>[again, this change was quite dramatic; I was more in the flow of just letting the imagery come into my mind and I simply spoke what I saw or sensed.]</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> is this your regular ship that you sail on?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> we&rsquo;ve been here for a while, a couple years.  we actually stole the ship from a different group, had to kill them to get it.  and I helped save my captain in that battle, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m so well liked now.  my name is Ric.  [spelling as R-i-c was clear to me.]</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> about how old are you in this life?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> I don&rsquo;t know.  extremely strong, chest is huge.  muscles.</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> so you&rsquo;re a pretty big person?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> yeah.   [I get the sense I was like big as Conan or Arnold Schwarzenegger.]</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> and do you carry a sword or a knife?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> not right now don&rsquo;t have to, cause we&rsquo;re in the middle of the ocean, nothing to do.</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> Where are y&rsquo;all headed?  where is your ship headed?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> seeking adventure, something about Spain, um, we might be trying to pull of the biggest heist we have a bunch of the queens crown jewels there&rsquo;s been a deal worked out.  my captain set up something and we&rsquo;re.. we&rsquo;re going to .. we&rsquo;re going to split it with the other team, but my captain is hoping to get more than the original bargain and I know that I&rsquo;ll get paid plenty no matter what, just as long as we pull it off.</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> and do you continue on the ship after that, or do you leave the ship?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> we leave.  we got crazy big money I think the whole ship is disbanded.  I never saw anyone again.  One man was killed. mostly it was very simple.  I think I killed someone in the process.</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> you don&rsquo;t seem to have any bad feelings about that.</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> it&rsquo;s just what had to be done to get the money and gold.  Plus people are killed all the time.  If they had, if people weren&rsquo;t strong, they couldn&rsquo;t expect to live very long.  they shouldn&rsquo;t try to fight. or they shouldn&rsquo;t try to fight a battle they can&rsquo;t possibly win.</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> What did you do with your money?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> bought like, at first I see like, bought a business of some sort, I don&rsquo;t know anything about it though.  I stayed in a hotel and I could buy sex.  never was married in this life.  by myself again.  alone.</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> that seems to be a theme doesn&rsquo;t it?
<br>let&rsquo;s do one more.  see if we can pull up something different.
close your eyes in that life, remembering everything you see it&rsquo;ll be a new experience.  and I&rsquo;m going to count forward again, from 1 to 3.  1. 2. 3.
<br>Again you can open your eyes in that life.</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> Jungle.  leading.. friends tribe through jungle.  it&rsquo;s becoming dark.  we&rsquo;ve been walking a long time.</p>

<p><p>[I wondered &ldquo;why jungle?&rdquo;  It took me a second to get used to the idea that I might truly live in the jungle.]</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> it&rsquo;s night time?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> it is now.  we don&rsquo;t make, we don&rsquo;t make a fire.</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> you seem worried here.</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> maybe.  I don&rsquo;t know why we&rsquo;re on the trail if we&rsquo;re trying to not be seen.  it&rsquo;s a very small trail though.  that not many people know about.  and&hellip;</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> we&rsquo;re on the trail..  to&hellip; make, make peace
if we get to the other tribe&rsquo;s chief, we can make peace and there will be no more battle between us.  we&rsquo;re bringing them a token&hellip; (I think) like an idol on&hellip;. this&hellip; as if on a satin pillow (I can&rsquo;t imagine where we got one of those) very&hellip; very  secretive until we can get there.  and show them we mean no harm and want the battle to be over.
if we get caught halfway, the other tribe will try to kill us because there&rsquo;s.. because the battle is still going on until we make it&hellip;.</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> and we do make it and I stay there&hellip;.   with&hellip; I stay in the new village..</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> are you kind of like an emmisary, or..?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> maybe.. that word doesn&rsquo;t mean anything here.  I&rsquo;m a sacrifice from my tribe to be given to this tribe</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> like a hostage</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> no</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> but in a good way, I understand what you mean  like an insurance</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> there&rsquo;s nothing negative at all</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> Right.  Caesar used to do that.</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> I just live there now.</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> Mm hmm   Did you marry into that tribe?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> Yeah.  I didn&rsquo;t really know her.  it was arranged; I didn&rsquo;t have a choice in it really.</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> part of the ceremony.</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> she&rsquo;s nice enough.  No children ever.  some people were wishing we would have children but we never did.  I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> who was wishing you would have children?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> some people hoped it would make the peace last longer, or to insure it would last longer, but it seems to be peaceful anyway.</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> what are you doing?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> just living day to day in the village.  making&hellip;  carrying&hellip; flour grain or something and I, whittle talismans out of stone.. no, using stone, out of wood or bark, coconut or something maybe, that can be used as necklaces - little figures that can be used as tribal warriors, medicine men maybe.</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> I can pretty much do whatever I want, in the village as long as I live peacefully by their rules and stay there.  at the same time I am free to go, but that would endanger the peace.  and they&hellip; my tribe knew that I would value the peace more than my freedom, but I don&rsquo;t feel, enslaved.. I just live here, although I think I had family&hellip; I don&rsquo;t see a wife, but children, a small boy who I had to leave behind.  I get to see him later; I&rsquo;m very proud of him, he was about 10 , 8 when I left and I get to see him later; he&rsquo;s a full grown man, and the peace has stayed between our villages and I get to see him. I call him my son but he&rsquo;s not really.</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> did you get to be very old in this life?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> yeah.   there&rsquo;s no real.. keeping track of the accumulated years.. we&rsquo;re very aware of where we are in a given year, but don&rsquo;t count the years, only that we live where we are now.</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> is it mostly a tropical sort of climate?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> oh yes.. very .. incredibly thick jungle and I don&rsquo;t even remember how to get back to my village now.. I have a general sense of where it should be , but it&rsquo;s been so long that I don&rsquo;t even .. this is more my home to me now.  I don&rsquo;t want to go back.. or I know that nothing would be the same if I went back, except that it&rsquo;s my old village.</p>

<p><p class=lilly><b>Lilly:</b> do you have a sense of your name?</p>

<p><p class=rob><b>Rob:</b> cannot pronounce it.</p>

<p><p>[I wonder about that.  If I were more deeply hypnotized, would I have began some native jungle language, long since forgotten?  One where my name is a short series of clicks and whistles?]</p>

<p><p>================================</p>

<p><p>And so that was it.  I unrelaxed and returned my entire self to the room, amidst an astonishing amount of knuckle cracking.  I feel like the first &lsquo;place&rsquo; was my outer mind trying to get to a past life, but the other 3 seemed to come more naturally from real past life experiences.</p>

<p><p>With Love
<br>- Rob</p>

<p class=date>10:13pm CST Tuesday 25 January 2000</p></p>

<p><p>I have finally officially moved all my 1999 journal entries from Geocities to here.  It took so long because I wanted to create &ldquo;this page has moved&rdquo; links from all the pages on geocities to here.  I did that.  Not precise page to page matching, but I matched from page there to month here.</p>

<p><p>In the process I also destroyed the front page of my geocities site.  I have a backup copy of it, but I guess it&rsquo;s about time to spank that front page anyway.</p>

<p><p>I really have an appreciation for how difficult it is to maintain a big ass website.  This is why most people don&rsquo;t do it by hand!</p>

<p><p>Tomorrow begins my new KTRU schedule!!  9-11am on Wednesdays!  yay!!</p>

                        <p><title>Tunnel</title>
<p class=date>4:20pm CST Monday 23 January 2000</p></p>

<p><p>I had to do it.</p>

<p><p>Highway 59 is under construction (it&rsquo;s being widened)
near my house.  A section
of 59 travels through a very short canyon type thing below
ground level, allowing some residential streets to cross
it with no interruption.</p>

<p><p>One of these bridges (the one called Hazard Street Bridge)
includes a big pipe/tube thing 24 inches in diameter that
carries who knows what across the bridge.</p>

<p><p>Because the bridge highway is being widened, a new
longer pipe sits beside the old pipe, ready to go into
place to carry who knows what across the longer bridge.</p>

<p><p>Construction has always intrigued me; I love watching
the big machines scoop loads of dirt, or shattered sections
of concrete, or pour new concrete, or lift giant sections
of highway or whatever.</p>

<p><p>Today as I drove by, I noticed that there was no such
activity going on at this bridge.  I decided to take a
long around.</p>

<p><p>Saw some dirt, a hole or two, big giant posts to hold
the new pipe, and I saw the new pipe.  Nice bright turquoise,
24 inches in diameter, and pretty dang long.  I peered
inside and could see the light from the other end.  It
wasn&rsquo;t a perfect circle of light; the ends were slightly
bent downward:</p>

<p><p><pre></p>

<hr />

<p>/                                </p>

<p></pre></p>

<p><p>But there was light and the tube looked clear of
obstructions.  Hmm.</p>

<p><p>I walked along it a bit, banged on it some, gave
it a good push..  seemed quite solid and didn&rsquo;t move at
all.  Hmm.</p>

<p><p>I walked the entire length, watching traffic pass by
underneath the bridge, watching for anyone watching me,
watching my brain in general.  Hmm.</p>

<p><p>I got to the other end and peered in again.  It looked
clear from this end as well, although this end was resting
on some plywood (instead of spilling into the air on the
first end), making the exact entrance a bit less than
24&rdquo; in diameter.   Hmm.</p>

<p><p>I looked around a bit more and checked the time on my
cell phone.  1:55pm.  My brain was in overdrive.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Awright.  Probably nothing bad will happen.  There&rsquo;s
no dogs or monsters in the pipe.  Plenty of air in it.<br />
No one is watching.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Are you crazy?  What if I get stuck?  How would anyone
find me?  What if the workers come back right now and
install the pipe with me in it?  They would never hear me
screaming!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Man, it&rsquo;s Sunday!  No one is going to install this
pipe right now, c&rsquo;mon.  Plus, what if you <em>don&rsquo;t</em>
do it?  You will never know.  Never never never.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So? I will still be alive.  I can imagine what it would
be like - tight squeeze; not really a big deal.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So do it!  You&rsquo;re only 30, man.  This opportunity might
not come again soon.  You gotta do it while you&rsquo;re young!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Awright.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>So I wriggled my way inside.</p>

<p><p>Hmm.  Not as much airflow as I might have guessed.
<br>Hmm.  Not as much room as I might have guessed.
<br>Ow, this little gravel shit is sharp on my knees.</p>

<p><p>I began in prone position, pulling myself forward on
my elbows and toes.  That took a significant amount of
energy and I quickly began to feel hot and almost
suffocated.  I looked ahead.  Long way to go.  Behind
me was the entrance bright and inviting.</p>

<p><p>I forged ahead.  I found that I could barely crawl,
bringing one knee forward at a time.  I could not kneel
on both knees; there was not enough room.  I ambled through a
spider web.  Eww. I hadn&rsquo;t thought about that.  There
seemed to be no spider nearby, nor any insect victims.  Bluh!</p>

<p><p>The inside of the tube was coated in
fine dust, with not so fine gravel collected at the bottom.
Most times the bottom was relatively clean, and I could
do my flattened crawl, brushing my hips and butt against
the top of the tube with each step.  I closed my eyes as
I paced myself through.  I visualized myself suddenly
at the other end.</p>

<p><p>Suddenly, the gravel on the bottom ground into my knees.
I had to resort to my elbows and toes, and I kept my eyes
open.</p>

<p><p>I looked up.  Looked like about half way.  I felt somewhat hot and
had to gently control my breathing to keep my perceived
oxygen level correct.</p>

<p><p>I thought about resting for a second now that I was
halfway through but my brain jumped to the grandest irony:
what if I fell asleep and woke up just before I was somehow
trapped and being exactly in the center, neither end
would be closer for my escape!</p>

<p><p>I kept crawling.  Kept brushing my hips against the top.
Occasionally brushed gravel off my knees with my hand.
I began to sweat.  Fine dust turned into mud on my arms
and hands.  My glasses began to slide off my head.  Kept
crawling.</p>

<p><p>I looked up.  Almost there.  About 25 more feet.  Kept
going until finally I poured myself out of the end onto the ground.</p>

<p><p>Got up.  Oh my gosh I am dirty!  I uselessly brushed
myself off and produced a cloud of dust when I sat in my car.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, Scott.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Drove to work to clean myself off.  I was closer to
work than to home, and I really felt nasty driving my car
like this.</p>

<p><p>Washed my arms up to my elbows and took my shirt off
to soak it in the sink.  I felt relatively certain no one
else was in the building, so I took my shorts off and began
to brush them off with a wet paper towel.</p>

<p><p>Began to wash my knees.  I stretched my right knee up
into the sink and brushed it off gently as the water
rinsed all the dirt off.  Then something kinda poked my
hand. Holy cow what is this?</p>

<p><p>A staple was fully stabbed at an angle into the skin
over my kneecap.  EEEK!!!</p>

<p><p>Felt a bit creepy as I pulled it out.  Tiny puncture
wound.  Little blood.  Umm..  yes tetnus shot is up to
date.  Shudder eewww.</p>

<p><p>Washing the other knee off was significantly less
traumatic, except my cell phone rang.</p>

<p><p>Dug through my shorts pockets to find it.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;HI.  Where are you?&rdquo; It was Wende.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m at work.  In my underwear washing up in the bathroom.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>[pause]  &ldquo;Any particular reason why?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I gave her the brief version of the story.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Rob, I think we&rsquo;ll need to talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>She had called to see if I had called her, but I had not
so we hung up.  I finished cleaning up then got re-dressed
and went into the office.</p>

<p><p>Patrick was there.  I told him a longer version of the
story.  He understood the &ldquo;have to do it; only chance I&rsquo;ll
get&rdquo; kind of thing.</p>

<p><p>Went home and here I am.</p>

<p><p>With Love
<br>- Rob</p>

<pre><code>How difficult could it be to write a message that automatically justifies
its own margins?  By 'automatic justification' I mean that each line of a
message would have the same number of characters in it.  Then, viewing an
automatically self-justifying message (with a fixed-width font), like the
one you are reading now, results in an aesthetically pleasing experience.

I saw such a message in 1994 during my days at University of Houston.  It
was sent to me as a forward from someone and I have kept it since.  Today
while at work, I decided to write such a message just to see how much fun
it would be.  So far, things are looking up.  I am going to save this and
work on it some more later.  Maybe I can also make this sentence line up.

It is now the year 2000 and we are still here.  The so-called Y2K bug has
had no effect on any of my computers, and fortunately has not resulted in
the release of Windows 2000.  I happen to prefer unix, which is why I use
Linux at home.  Some people say &quot;Linux isn't real unix,&quot; to which I reply
&quot;at least it's not Microsoft.&quot;  That usually ends such arguments quickly.

Back to this message.  I am also noticing that each paragraph has exactly
five lines in it!  This delightful phenomenon was unplanned, and I feel a
bit nervous even bringing it up.  I may not be able to maintain such high
standards for the rest of this message, let alone even for this paragraph
that I am currently typing.  We shall see soon enough.  I am almost done.

Yes!  Wow.  That was easier than I thought.  I encourage everyone to only
write using fixed width fonts and make their margins auto-self-justifying
like this one.  For truly, this is simple.  The real test begins with the
next paragraph from which I will begin shrinking the right margin by just
one character per line.  I shall still maintain five lines per paragraph.  

Here we are with five lovely five-line paragraphs above, each with lovely
auto-justification of seventy-three characters in each line.  But watch.
Now I shall begin the process of removing a single character from every
line, thereby slowly shrinking the margins of this message.  Now truly
this was not my idea.  I have stolen it from a message I saw in 1994.
                                                                     
But I want my document to be better in some way.  I think with five
line paragraphs, that will do the trick.  Please notice above, two
characters have been removed from the first line of the paragraph
so that the overall smooth diagonal line will be maintained over
the paragraph boundaries.  I hope that readers appreciate this.
                                                               
My true goal for writing this is to spread some type of humor
throughout the Internet, and for my message to be copied and
forwarded millions of times throughout the globe.  Everyone
has received far too many fake emails, each promising cash
rewards or some type of good luck if people forward them.
                                                         
However, I mostly hate the fake virus warning messages.
Maybe hate is too strong of a word, but I think people
who resort to such ridiculous and childish methods of
achieving fame through widespread distribution of an
email message should have to apologize to everyone.

Please do not forward this message unless you are
certain the recipient will delight in reading an
aesthetically pleasing message such as this.  I
feel that many people would enjoy it, but some
people have much more important things to do.

I for one, am not one of those people.  Not
to say I have nothing better to do, but in
each day people should find joy in living
their lives.  I hope this message brings
joy to the lives of everyone who reads.

I have nearly reached the end of this
message, but I still need to include
historical information.  Hopefully,
this message will enjoy a long and
happy journey through cyberspace.

This message was started on the
8th of November, 1999 and I am
finishing it 22 January 2000.
That's today, so I better be
prepared to finish the job.

Unfortunately, the author
of the original message,
from whom I got an idea
to write this one, did
not include any name.

I will include mine
in this paragraph.
I'm Rob Nugen and
www.robnugen.com
is my new site.

Understand, I
include this
because I'm
happy with
my email.

Now you
can go
enjoy
your
day
OK
!

<p><p>Well, they took Wende&rsquo;s jewelry, clock radio, phone and a hand towel and
wash cloths (probably to wipe fingerprints).  Jewelry included
grandmother&rsquo;s diamond earrings, an expensive diamond and platinum ring, and
sacred Aggie Ring (which I think can be replaced free of charge).</p>

<p><p>Her most prized possessions, her cats were fine; in fact, Thief
remounted the window panes which kept the cats in.  Went out through the
front door, leaving it unlocked.</p>

<p><p>But, sense of safety has been shattered. Wende has been considering
moving somewhere else anyway (lease is up soon); maybe this will do it.
 We&rsquo;ve been considering getting a year lease in 2 bedroom place (with alarm
system).  Dunno if that will happen or not.</p>

<p><p>(I&rsquo;m actually guessing not, unless Wende begins the footwork to look; I
have almost no interest in moving until April of next year.  (That&rsquo;s when I
complete my term on district YAC and my last ties to Texas will be
released.  (&lsquo;cept for my dad and mom, but there&rsquo;s always the phone.) I&rsquo;ve
been weaning back my youth group involvement for a while now.) At that
point, I&rsquo;m looking west to Santa Monica!)</p>

<p><p><hr></p>

<p><p>Today at work I&rsquo;ve been researching smoke alarms.  Maybe I&rsquo;ll look into
a security alarm too!  I&rsquo;m gonna consult with local Fire Marshall Plan
Checking to see where we should install smoke alarms.  I&rsquo;ve got floor plans
for our suite, and I learned that we&rsquo;ve expanded our suite once.
 Interesting to learn the history and see the evidence in the ceiling,
wall, floor (who is it?) surfaces!</p>

<p><p>Um, that&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p><p>With Love
<br>- Rob</p>

<p><p>Oh wait..  I&rsquo;ve been working on transcribing my past life regression
adventures. Here&rsquo;s the short version:</p>

<p><p>In a physically relaxed state, I was verbally led through visualization
in a limo, out into the country, through a fog, out of limo, to my Guide,
across a bridge to &hellip;.  and I filled in the blanks from there.</p>

<p><p>First &ldquo;place&rdquo; seemed not to be a past life, but just a very relaxed
place.</p>

<p><p>Second I found myself walking down a steep mountain road, carrying some
coins to purchase spices at a trading area at the base of the mountain.  I
had been sent by my wife.  In that life I was a pretty dumb guy who just
did what he was told by his wife.</p>

<p><p>Third place, I found myself as a pirate on a ship in the middle of the
ocean, on a ship we had stolen from another group.  I was physically huge
HUGE like Arnold Schwarzenegger huge and had saved my captain&rsquo;s life.  We
were on an adventure to Spain(?) to get a big phat load of gold and jewels.
 The ship was disbanded after our payoff and I lived on the wealth in a
&ldquo;hotel&rdquo; for the rest of my life.</p>

<p><p>Last, I found myself leading a group of friends (tribe) through dense
jungle on a Peace Offering mission with the neighboring tribe.  We had to
not be caught or would be attacked by their tribe, but once we arrived and
offered peace, the war would be over.  Turns out <em>I</em> was the peace
offering.  I lived the rest of my life in this new village, and peace
reigned between our tribes.</p>

<p><p>&mdash;&ndash;</p>

<p><p>So far, I&rsquo;ve transcribed 3.5 of the adventures, and am almost done.  I
still have to HTML format them, but that shouldn&rsquo;t take too long.</p>

<p><p>With Love
<br>- Rob</p>
