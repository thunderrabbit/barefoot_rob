<p>Now I am surrounded by hundreds of acres of fields, on a flat
plain.  No hills in sight.  Is this the top of the bluff that oh I
forgot her name advisor from Amarillo described as the surface
Amarillo?  Maybe.</p>

<p>Almost no trees.. well some trees, but nothing I could call a
forest.</p>

<p>Wow.  This was cool.  I saw a train crossing from left to right
under the freeway ahead of me.  Fine.</p>

<p>Then I saw the same train crossing from right to left under the
freeway ahead of me.  Wow.  Pretty cool.</p>

<p>But now our paths have gone asymptotic; I am "right beside" this
train (it's 100 yards to my left) as it's traveling fully sixty miles
per hour!!</p>

<p>For a freight train that seems quite amazing.  Plus it was going up
and down gentle slopes a bit ago.  So cool.  Of course the bullet
trains in Japan and Europe are faster, but it's built sleekly with
supa smoove tracks and such.  This is a freight train, all big and
boxy.  Amazing.</p>

<p>Synchronistically, just as I was passing the engines of the train,
the song "8 Mile" started, which features locomotive horn sound at the
beginning of the song.  Nice.</p>

<p>43 miles to Odessa.  327 miles traveled so far today.</p>

<p class=date>5:55pm</p>

<p>Just stopped at a gas station to exchange liquids.</p>

<p>Hmmm.  I'm not sure where I am.  Hopefully as far as Midland or
even Odessa, but possibly only Big Spring.  349 miles traveled.</p>

<p>Midland.  Cool.</p>

<p>It's quite dusky outside.  Looking at the map I see a rest area
just after um, Pecos, just just before Toyah or something.  I'm pretty
sure i can make it there; if not, there is one closer..  but I know
I'll make the one after Pecos.  I'll probably be quite awake and get
all the way to Balmoreah tonight, but it's possible they will be
closed for the evening when I get there.  In that case, there is
another rest area somewhat nearby.</p>

<p>I'm hoping I'll be able to just sleep without paying anything, and
then tomorrow get to explore around Balmoreah which Fred and I enjoyed
greatly back in 1984 or 83 or something when our parents took us cross
country to Grand Canyon and such.</p>

<p>Oh!!  That reminds me that i'll be close to Las Vegas, where I can
toss a single dollar into a slot machine and not be tempted to do
more, no matter what the outcome.</p>

<p>Back in the day, Fred and I got to play at the upper level of
Circus Circus in Las Vegas, which I mentioned to someone who responded
with "Circus Circus??  Awh that place is terrible...." or something.
We'll see.</p>

<p>With Janette's help, Josephine and I each made another batch of
recycled paper.  Surprisingly (not), Josephine's is pink.</p>

<p>Mine is basically blue-ish, but that's mostly coincidence, except
that I recycled some blue paper (more bank account sheets).</p>

<p>Slowly</p>

<p>Slowly</p>

<p>Slowly I am planning my trek out west.  I feel so stuck, with so
much shit to do first; gotta get organized, prioritized, normalized,
coordinized, settled before I go.</p>

<p>I'm on the verge of engaging my Cleaning Mood, which basically
throws a lot of shit away and turns upside-down and shakes the
Etch-A-Sketch of my life.  This seems similar to Jackie's emotionless
machine get shit done mood.</p>

<p>I got maps from AAA.  I mailed Wende her card thing on recycled
paper.  The entire trip driving I had Eminem on full blast,
rap-yelling along with him.  I know a lot of lyrics on the tape I've
got.</p>

<p>Okay.</p>

<p>Go.</p>

<p class=date>8:26pm</p>

<p>Lots of cookies eaten, lots of philosophy discussed, lots of steps
taken as Janette and I walked to Whole Foods to get sea salt for
Josephine's piercing.</p>

<p>I ranted to Janette about my life and how big a chunk I seem to
have bitten off this time around, how I have the entire world open to
me yet I seem afraid to take a simple trek out west across the states
(my own manifest destiny??)... that I just want to learn languages and
learn cultures and meet a bunch of people around the world and be all
wazzap in different languages and all that.  Just to get a sense of
what is out there in the world.</p>

<p>That I have no fear of dying, only a fear of being alone.</p>

<p class=date>9:08pm</p>

<p>I have just about finished packing.  Just need to pack my
nonperishable food and do a bit of laundry and toss bags into the
car.  Oh, and my bike.  Then I'm set.</p>

<p>I'm taking far less stuff on this trek than my eastern state trek.</p>

<p>I feel much better than earlier today.  Talking with Janette helped
a lot.  I got my scrapbook caught up - had lots of notes and movie
stubs and pictures floating around.. they are all securely taped to
pages in my scrapbook now.</p>

<p>I am basically packed - taking a minimum amount of stuff - just
clothes, and my computer and that's it.  And my Japanese books and
that's it.  Plus the rest of the books in my library, and my cell
phone, and that's it.  Oh, and my bike.  But that's it.  That's all
I'm taking.  Plus some money and some letter writing supplies, and
that's everything.  And Sock Monkey.  But nothing more than that.. and
my food, but that's it.  And my car.  And skates in the trunk.  But
that's all I'm taking.  And my camera of course, but nothing else.
Along with my sleeping bag and pillow, but that is it; I'm not taking
anything else.  Except my maps.  I'm taking them, but no more than
that, I mean it.  And my music, but nothing more.  Oh, and my
toothbrush and stuff, but that's all.  And shoes.  Nothing else.</p>

<p>I'm pretty tired.  I'm doing a little load of laundry, and I'm
definitely leaving tomorrow.  I was scoping out the map and see cool
places like Pie Town, White Sands, Albuquerque, Gallup, four corners,
Aztec Ruins Monument, etc etc.  Soo much to see!!!</p>

<p>Oh and the grand canyon and all that.  I also wanna see Hoover Dam
again.</p>

<p class=date>1:28am CST Tuesday 26 November 2002</p>

<p>Wow.  So I've been poring over my maps and see so so so so so many
options.  The simplest thing is to take 30 west, which merges into 20
just west of Fort Worth and 20 merges into 10 just east of El Paso.
North-ish of El Paso is Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico, and north of
that is Roswell possibly featuring interesting alien stuff.  But if I
go north at Abilene, I can see Lubbock (just to say I've been there)
and to Amarillo (ditto) and then go west on 40 and be right in the
middle of the top of New Mexico and see stuff up there.  I forget
what.</p>

<p>I decided I was too tired to decide now, so I'm going to bed and
will maybe decide in the AM.  Or maybe in Big Springs or in Abilene.</p>

<p>Going to Jefferson church in Fort Worth to pick up Josephine after
the Social Action Conference.  I'm so glad that Jack was able to put
together such a great conference!  I hope it went as well as I
imagine.  Or better.</p>

<p class=date>5:09pm</p>

<p>Today I solved two of Josephine's Infinite Question targets.  One
was "the first person to have a love song written about him/her" (that
one I started a few days ago, and Josephine gave me a good hint when
Jared came into the room with a hymnal).  The other was "the answer to
this question."  That one I didn't perfectly get, but she said it was
pretty clever, which made me think along those lines.</p>

<p>She got one of mine, "the color pink," and she plus Marisa (who
spoke at the Social Action Conference, and whom we dropped off at the
airport) got "Aaliah" (sp), which I actually did to taunt Josephine
because I just kept saying "yes" to Marisa's questions so she could
get it really easily, but she didn't ask a specific question quickly
enough to make my ploy apparent.</p>

<p>After arriving home and munching and saying "fine" "fine" "fine"
"fine" and "dude" "dude" "dude" "dude" over and over with food in our
mouths, we rented <em>Friday</em> on DVD and just watched it.  Good
times.</p>

<p>Makes me wanna make a movie!</p>

<p>Good morning.  I woke up at 7:30; part of me is tempted to just
piss around all day, but I know I must work past that to allow my
western trek to happen.</p>

<p class=date>8:37am</p>

<p>Okay.  I've got a pretty good start on things to do today.  Get
stamps, change oil and spark plugs in Scott, return <em>Stranger In A
Strange Land</em> (and pay the late fee), get a CD to cassette adapter
so my computer can play tunes while I'm on the road.....</p>

<p>While grokking all that stuff, I had gone to the kitchen and found
the sink full of shredded soggy paper.</p>

<p>Short version of the story is that I threw the mess into the
blender and rolling pinned it vaguely flat on some towels on the
table.  Now it's drying on a cookie sheet.  Might take a while to dry
since there is no heat involved, but oh well.</p>

<p>Since it's Wende's account information that I blended, I'll write a
letter to her on it.</p>
