<p class=date>10:39am CST Saturday 9 February 2002</p></p>

<p>I am outside now right at the end of the medical building parking
lot which is across the street from my apartment complex. I have
brought Spot out here for his first walk in a long time - basically
since I moved in with Wende in April 2000.</p>

<p>Spot was pretty scared of all the traffic on Greenbriar and I
thought we were going to have to abort the mission as he got away and
nearly jumped back over the wall into the complex.  I caught him as he
tried to run past me (I only caught him because he was trapped in a
cat sized trough between the wall and the curb of the sidewalk.)  We
made it across the street and parking lot without further incident.</p>

<p>I told him I would sit right here while he explored around and he
ran straight underneath a hedge and has made his base underneath the
hedge and a truck parked in front of the hedge.  He is 3 parking
spaces away from me now, crouched underneat the truck.</p>

<p>I have just written out a simplified version of Little Red Riding
Hood for <img src="/images/peeps/Rie/li.jpg"><img src="/images/peeps/Rie/e.jpg"> ("Lee-eh")
to sign in ASL on the last day of class (our final exam of sorts).
Now I need to find a story for myself to sign.</p>

<p>Maybe I'll sign the story of Spot and I that we are experiencing
now.  Yes.  That's perfect.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p><a href="/images/cats/spot_behind_gate.jpg"><img src="/images/cats/thumbs/spot_behind_gate.jpg" align="left"></a>

<p>As I collected my stuff, I began calling Spot, "here Spot.  Com'ere Spot." 
snapping my fingers and such.  I think this made him feel more comfortable for he
started to explore more than just the hedge and the truck.  Soon he hopped off the 
curb and visited the building next door.  Sniffed around at first and then slipped
between the bars of this securely locked gate.</p>

<p>What a wonderful irony.  Just as I'm ready to go home, Spot decided to explore
some more.  He pawed around in the flower bed, and he may have left some fertilizer
for the flowers.</p>

<p>I eventually coaxed him out and carried him home.</p>

<p>Once we got inside the complex, he got away again, but only briefly.  I hope Spot 
enjoyed his great adventure!</p>

<p>I have disbanded the Ring for People Named Rob.  It was a cute
little thing to have around for a while, but there were only 6 Robs on
the ring, and none of them wanted to be the new ringmaster when I
decided to give up my role.</p>

<p>This Rob is the only one who actually replied to my email: <a

<p>Last night ASL was fun; we went over the classifiers, which
basically amount to adjectives to describe/represent objects.  I had
been through that lesson two previous times, so I enjoyed watching the
recognition on Kathy's face in the class as she heard about them for
the first time.</p>

<p>After ASL, I went with Rie (pronounced Lee-eh) to Whole Foods where
she taught me the first 5 vowel characters in Japanese, basically the
first 5 hiragana.  Now I can write (draw?) those 5 characters!  :-)
Only 70-few characters left before I know all the hiragana and
katakana!</p>

<p>And then begins the process of spelling out words with them and then
learning the thousands of kanji, which are words of 1 character each.</p>

<p class=date>7:30am Sunday 3 February 2002</p></p>

<p>Wake up now.  Food is already set up.</p>

<p>It's freezing outside, making the wake up process all the more
undesirable.  I gotta get up now.</p>

<p>- - - - </p>

<p>Last night as we were all in that oh-so-tired state, I heard David
talking so I knew he was awake.</p>

<p>"Hey David," I hollered across the room, my eyes closed.</p>

<p>"Yeah?"</p>

<p>"Pick a number between one and fifteen, and don't tell me what it is."</p>

<p>"Alright."</p>

<p>"Is it on this card?"</p>

<p>"Um, yes."</p>

<p>"Is it on this card?"</p>

<p>"no."</p>

<p>"Is it on this card?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Is it on this card?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Ten!  Whoohoo!" I giggled with glee.  Understand this was all done
verbally. there were no 'cards.'</p>

<p>Immediately we heard another voice in the room, "That's stupid, you
guys are just doing binary!  Anyone can do that!"</p>

<p>"But it works and it's <em>funny!</em>" I explained.</p>

<p>Then, another voice, "What's binary?  What are you guys talking
about??"  Oh so very beautiful and funny.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>After cleanup, munching, hugs, we had closing circle, which
included David, Zach and I singing the Yogi Bear song, ending with an
Ants and Cheese verse.  We just love that song, and I love that
everyone who hears it more than 3 times loves it too!!!</p>

<p>- - - - -</p>

<p>After closing circle, we joined the YAC con-debriefing meeting.
Jaine basically went down a checklist and got feedback on how people
thought each part of the con went.  Generally, the only thing that
needed fixing was orienting the adults as to what they can expect.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Then David and I took a short walk down the street while waiting
for our ride to the airport.  We asked a few different places for a
postcard, but none could be found.  We walked backwards back to the
church because the wind was bitterly cold.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Our ride stopped by a drugstore, where I bought a postcard for 10
cents.  We slept most of the way to the airport.  At the airport on
check-in, we were selected to have our bags searched (all our carry-on
and checked baggage), which we thought was just fine, but another lady
was not as pleased when it happened to her.  The guy was so happy with
how cool we were about it, that he was happy to mail the postcard for
me, considering there are no more mailboxes inside the airports.  One
of the MPs said, "it's a perfect place for a bomb to be deposited," so
they have all been removed.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>The steward talked to us as long as possible before we taxied cause
David and I are in such cheerful smiley moods after such a great
trip.  Just now in the middle of our flight, I snuck forward and
pushed the call-flight-attendant button above the flight attendant's
head, and snuck back to my seat before he turned around.  I was too
slap-happy-silly to keep a straight face, plus when he saw it was the
light above his head, he immediately looked my direction.  Very
funny.</p>

<p class=date>4:40pm Sunday 3 February 2002</p>

<p>Just slept on the floor in the Detroit airport for a while, a bit
over an hour.</p>

<p>Last night Silent Football occurred after the dance, through much
of which I slept (in the same room with many decibel music pumping,
much to the amazement of some advisors who talked about me last night,
according to one advisor I spoke with this morning) because I was flat
tired.</p>

<p>The game had about 18 people.  They do zooms with elbows, cannot
reverse the direction of the Fwap, which they call Thwap, allow "a buh
a whah a duh?" which was quite abused when people raise their hands,
and allow the dictator to do whatever they want.</p>

<p>Basically, the game was chaotic and unstructured.  It started off
the way our games get after 2 hours of play.</p>

<p>Lori ("Beast" because of her dreads) was dictator.  Jaine, Tommy,
Zach were most vocal.  At one point Jaine go renamed to Lesbian Cunt
Sucker or something equally crude, after which she immediately left
the game and was mad according to Bridgette, who was asked to check
after her.  Jaine came back and pulled Lori out of the game at which
point Craig (?) <em>immediately</em> caused a Cold Rush of Air, so I
raised my hand, Zach took over dictatorship, I tattled, and then
someone said Zach couldn't award penance points to Craig, so Zach
awarded a penance point to me instead even though I hadn't made an
error. Funny.</p>

<p>Lori and Jaine returned, sparred cat-fight roman-greco wrestling
style and then rejoined the game.  Ultimately Tommy lost and had to do
one verse of Little Bunny Foo Foo while being held upside down at
closing circle.</p>

<p class=date>9:30pm</p>

<p>My bag didn't make it, though Dave's did, and we checked them at
the same time.  I just filed a claim and they say they'll deliver it
to me tomorrow.</p>

<p>(they did)</p>

<p class=date>10:45pm</p>

<p>I'm home now.  I'm going to shower and then sleep.  So great to be
home after such a great weekend!!!</p>

<p>Talent Show soon.</p>

<p>Amazing presentation today by <a
href="https://www.alancanfora.com">Alan Canfora</a> who was wounded
during the Kent State massacre on 4 May 1970.  I had zero idea that
anything had even happened, much less the details of the event.  He
presented a history of student rebellions over the past few hundred
years in America, starting in 1760 I think.</p>

<p>Then he described the anti-war efforts in late 1960s and tried to
give the most objective story possible.  Awesome stuff.  Read his
website; I cannot possibly do justice to the story.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I offered a 20+ minute joke for the Silent Social Action Auction.</p>

<p>I taught our touchgroup the game Captain Video, which they really
enjoyed.  Someone taught us a game called Swedish Drinking Game, which
is about as descriptive as Silent Football as a title for a game, and
has nothing to do with Sweden or Drinking.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>"Give us the name of a type of bean!!"</p>

<p>"Pinto!!"</p>

<p>"My dog Pinto likes to roam!
<br>One day Pinto, he left home!
<br>He came back so nice and clean..........
<br>Where oh where has Pinto Bean?
<br>Pinto Bean, Pinto Bean
<br>Where oh where has Pinto Bean???"</p>

<p>"Give us the name of another type of bean!"</p>

<p>"Pork-and!"</p>

<p class=date>1:11am Sunday 3 February 2002</p>

<p>Ohio-Meadville Social Action Con, night 2 of 2</p>

<p>Talent show was great fun, including two great dramatic poems:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The wheels, on the bus,
<br>go round, and round.... 
<br>round and round, round and round.</p>
<p>The wheels, on the bus, 
<br>go round, and round,
<br>all
<br>day
<br>long.</p>

<p>The people, on the bus,
<br>go up, and down,
<br>up and down,
<br>up... and down..
<br>The people
<br>on the bus
<br>go up
<br>and down
<br>all
<br>day
<br>long.</p>

<p>The wipers
<br>on the bus
<br>go swish
<br>swish swish
<br>swish
<br>swish swish
<br>swish
<br>swish swish</p>

<p>The wipers
<br>on the bus
<br>go swish
<br>swish swish
<br>all 
<br>day
<br>long.</p>

<p>etcetera.  VERY funny.</p></li>

<li><p>The next poem was a list of words, with each word intoned with
a different emotion:</p>

<p>Rake.   (sad)
<br>Gloves.  (surprised)
<br>Hoe.  (angry)
<br>Tiller. (relieved)
<br>Pitch fork. (afraid)
<br>Trowel. (happy)</p>

<p>Also very funny.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>David, Bob, Zach, Geovanni (sp), Woody, Nathan and I did a techno
song a cappella.  Fun good stuff including Zach interrupting with
"break it down Woody style" and then Woody (or whoever he called)
would bust out in their own little techno music freestyle for a bit,
and then we'd jump back to the song.  At the end, "Break it down,
Southwest Style," and we busted into "Ants and Cheese and Ants and
Cheese!" in a most rowdy hilarious way!</p>

<p>My touchgroup played Captain Video onstage.  That turned out to be
completely hilarious!  I was thankful that they liked it so much!</p>

<p>David and I did a great magic trick, combining Snaps, my magic
number guessing game, and Good Frog Bad Frog as a backup to get the
number, which I didn't get because I thought it was going to be a four
bit number, when we started, but it was 5 bits and I freaked a bit (no
pun intended) on getting Cleopatra because I think David misspelled
it, but I got it on the second try, but by then I had forgotten the
genders of the other people.</p>

<p>If I had relaxed some, I could have remembered that when it was
four bits, the number was 5, so I could just bitwise-shift-left 5 by
one bit and add a bit and get 11, which was the correct number.  But
we played good frog bad frog to get it instead.  That still worked.
And lots of people were impressed.  We'll do it again in Austin, and
this time I'll know it's 5 bits.</p>

<p>Two girls sang 3 songs, including Tori Amos' "Me and a gun," which
I found powerful and awesome.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>The dance is going on now after worship (interdependent web via
 yarn criss-crossing the circle, into which I plucked pulses across
 the circle from my node).  During the dance, Grant and I mosched
 doing &ldquo;Ants and Cheese&rdquo; and we bonked heads.  Mine is okay now.  I
 hope his is too.</p></p>

<p>I'm pretty much tired now.  I didn't really nap today although we
slept last night.  Oh- while the youth mostly cleaned up the church, I
told a 20 minute version of the Smart Dog Joke, while Dave gave a back
massage to Callie (sp), the intended joke and massage recipient from
the silent auction.</p>

<p>After the massage and joke session is when David and I developed
our amazing magic trick to astound everyone.</p>

<p>Oh, I forgot to mention in the talent show, Ashley and two other
girls did a funny skit:</p>

<p>"We need a volunteer from the audience!"</p>

<p>Zach was chosen fromt he ample hands raised.</p>

<p>"Okay, we need you to be a table."</p>

<p>Zach obliged, and knelt on hands and knees.  Took him a while to
get his back flat like a table.</p>

<p>The two girls walk into the set as if into a restaurant.</p>

<p>Third girl is waitress, "Hi, welcome to Zach's; can I get you a drink?"</p>

<p>"Water would be great."</p>

<p>"Okay, I'll be right back."</p>

<p>Waitress returns with a pitcher of water and sets it on Zach's
back, the table.  "Okay, I'll be back in a moment to get your order."</p>

<p>Both girls put their fingers in the water and taste them.  "Eww
this water is terrible!  I'm never coming here again!"</p>

<p>And they both leave Zach on stage on his hands and knees with a
pitcher of water on his back.</p>

<p>He tried to reach his hand back to remove the pitcher, but he was
rescued by a sympathetic audience member before disaster ensued.</p>

<p>David and I are at Intercontinental Airport, with an hour & 13
minutes before our flight leaves for Ohio for a YAC Exchange thing.</p>

<p>So, the most notable difference in the airport was 2 or 4 people in
fatigues at every check-in carrying assault rifles. I'm no gun expert
so I can't tell you what number, and I didn't spend a lot of time
gawking or chatting, but I got through the checkpoint, turned the
corner and saw the butt of the gun slung over her shoulder and I
exclaimed "Good Lord!" and looked up...  I mean the gun was right
fucking next to me - I was startled and I looked up the fatigues and
this woman was looking at me, a guy who just exclaimed "Good Lord"
while scoping out her assault rifle, as if to ask me "you got a
problem?"</p>

<p>No ma'am; I'll be on my way.</p>

<p>Walking down the jetway the nervous energy I felt prompted me to
joke toward David, "I could have asked her, 'Say... how'd you get
<em>that</em> in here???'" (Assuming we wanted to be held for
questioning and never fly again)....  but seriously I'm like holy shit
that is scary.  No longer on TV - that's an assault rifle right here.
Wow.</p>

<p class=date>noon Friday 1 February 2002</p>

<p>So the other detail about airport security is that everyone had to
show their ID and boarding pass as they got on the airplane.  Some
people were randomly (??) pulled out of line for more thorough
search/screening.</p>

<p>This is fine in theory, but in practice it was wack because the 3
guys doing the screening seemed quite unprofessional.  They were
young, joking together, not enunciating clearly to the passengers.
Before beginning their work, they gossiped and bantered together
talking about the legality of killing in self defense if someone tries
to steal their car.  I probably won't complain to anyone, but it
certainly seemed like low budget security.</p>

<p class=date>2:06pm</p>

<p>Descending now on the first flight.  This stewardess is <em>so
cute</em> and I can't quite explain why.  I'm not sure if she reminds
me of someone or what.</p>

<p>Interesting reading Brian O'Leary's <em>Exploring Inner and Outer
Space</em> chapter on UFOs in which he cites evidence of a
government-within-our-government sworn to higher than Top Secret
status and possible agreements between with and aliens to give us
technology in exchange for abductees, and that the star wars missile
defense program may be against aliens, not terrestrial missiles, and
Jimmy Carter didn't reveal UFO research as he promised in his campaign
speeches because government swore him to secrecy??????</p>

<p>It's 34 degrees and 18 mph wind with gusts to 25mph in Detroit, our
current destination.</p>

<p class=date>5pm</p>

<p>Fun zipping down the moving sidewalks which remind me of Star Wars
when a ship goes into and out of hyperspace.  When we get rich, Dave
and I are going to build <em>fast</em> moving sidewalks.</p>

<p>Our flight is overbooked.  We're choosing not to accept free round
trip to anywhere in US or Carribean in the next year in exchange for
not boarding.</p>

<p>We are, however, open to not taking a different flight which is
overbooked.  Hmmmm.</p>

<p>What about spending a week not taking flights that we previously
booked and accruing $ and free round trip tickets?</p>

<p class=date>6:11pm</p>

<p>We're late leaving - in the little plan now being de-iced.  A woman
with a voice like that in "Little Fluffy Clouds" by The Orb is sitting
in front of me.</p>

<p>I loaned my jacket to a woman from Ohio who packed her coat in
Miami.  She couldn't get her coat out of her checked-on baggage.</p>

<p>It was actually a stretch for me to do loan my jacket.  I'm glad I
did it.  The difficulty was in speaking up in a group of strangers,
and in allowing my possession out of my control.  Good job me.</p>

<p>Last night I did 4 loads of laundry around midnight.  I napped
between trips to the laundry room.  So freezing is the wind outside!!!</p>

<p>But later today I'll be in Ohio, where it's even more freeeezing!
Yikes!  I'm going with David as part of the Jahnny Depp (Joining And
Helpfully Networking Neighboring Yacs District Exchange Program
Packet)  (The "packet" is a reference to the document that describes
the who/where/how/why of the program)</p>

<p>This morning I stopped by KTRU to turn in a CD and Chad was there!
He works at Wende's work, and I encouraged him to apply to be a DJ.
He did and I was impressed with how quickly he could run the board -
basically as fast as me when I'm in chaos mode behind the scenes at
KTRU.  His coworker Rob (friend of Wende and me) is *also* a DJ now;
he just got accepted.  I'm excited!</p>

<p>So now I'm off to the airport..  oh hey</p>

<p>This is the first time I've even been to an airport, much less
flown since September.  I wonder how strict/fucked-up/crazy it will be
going through the lines.  David is checking a bag and carrying on 2
bags.  I'm checking a bag and carrying on 1 bag.  So weird to feel a
me-vs-them mentality when I'm "up against" the airport security.  Like
I have to prove myself to be good and do all the right things so they
won't be suspicious.  Very strange.</p>

<p>I'll take notes.</p>

<p>Bedtime now, except some of the YAC members are telling Emilio
Estevez jokes</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What do you call Emilio Estevez when he's brushing his teeth?
<br>Emilio Crestevez</p></li>

<li><p>What do you call Emilio Estevez after dinner?
<br>Emilio Digestevez</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There were many more.</p>

<p>When we arrived at the Akron/Canton airport, we wondered how we'd
know our driver person.  We saw a San Antonio Rally T-shirt - the Rub
A Dub Slug shirt.  Mary who attended San Antonio rally was there to
pick us up.  I didn't recognize her at first, but after a while I
remembered "oh yeah - I remember her from the rally...."</p>

<p>David was hungry so we stopped by White Castle, which was
<em>-*!N&nbsp;O&nbsp;T&nbsp;H&nbsp;I&nbsp;N&nbsp;G!*-</em> like I
imagined it from the Beastie Boys songs I've heard, but more like a
little fast food place that sold tiny tiny little hamburgers.  ("White
Castle burgers only come in one size!" is the B-Boy line in my head
now.) I got Chicken Rings, which are basically chicken nuggets in the
shape of rings.  Pretty cool idea.  Strange to bite into a ring and my
brain is expecting onion and tastes chicken!</p>

<p>Upon arrival at the church (we got <em>slightly</em> lost) we were
not immediately well-greeted, but when we told people, "Houston" or
"Texas" (or both) to the question, "where are you from?" we got "oh!!
You're the Texans!"  One guy asked, "are you rich?"  so I faked my
drawl, "yep, I got a hunnert and fifty thouusan acre ranch in mah back
yard, ohl wells all over the place, and ten thousan head a cattle
a-roamin the range."</p>

<p>Aimee was the first to greet David and me with hugs.  We've also
met Zach, Jessie, Jaine, Bridgette, Carey, ... hmm I'm getting
tired.</p>

<p>While talking to Aimee, David and I remembered our super magic
tricks from Houston Rally, so I made some cards to do the number
magic, and we did some of the Snaps magic trick as well.</p>

<p>We were also excited to learn that it had snowed after we arrived,
so Jaine and Bridgette escorted us outside to watch us be all, "wow!
Snow!!!!" and had a great snowball fight while they were all, "this is
nothing!  what are you crazy Texans thinking?"  Fun fun stuff.</p>

<p>So today is the officer meeting of our investment club.  I'm the
president, and I'm not saying I've done <em>nothing</em> to prepare
for this meeting, but I have done nothing for 3 weeks to prepare for
the meeting, and I've not done as much as I might have
hoped/expected/think-might-be-appropriate for this meeting.</p>

<p>I'm hard pressed to <em>not</em> say, "I can't do this; it's taking
too much of my time!"</p>

<p>Because really it hasn't taken a lot of my time; I haven't done
anything, but I have this sense that it should have taken time if I
had done enough.  Argh.  I don't know.</p>

<p>I'm at Dude's now, about to munch chicken /
spaghetti by Chef Gene.  Dude is reading the Service
Agreement with his potential new cell phone company:
"We may change your number at any time."  "We may
change your billing cycle at any time."</p>

<p>(I'm so far behind on my journal, that I fear I may
never catch up, so I'm just going to start again.)</p>

<p>Today after work I said HI to Jennifer at Paint
This! and picked up Bryn and Elizabeth's pieces, which
look great!  I helped Jennifer load the kiln and then
zipped home.  <em>Almost</em> went to Dude's house
unannounced, but chose not to.</p>

<p>Upon arrival at home, I said HI to Andrea who was
interested in my pottery adventures.  Turns out that
she has thrown several pieces (not "thrown" in the
shatter sense, but "thrown" in the creation sense) and
such.  I showed her and Alana two of my plates; Andrea
showed me her pieces.  She offered me some spaghetti,
which I accepted, and before it was served, Dude
called and asked if I was coming over for Wednesday
night dinner.</p>

<p>Oh shit I forgot about Wednesday night dinner! 
Turns out dinner at Dude's wouldn't be ready for a
while, so I completed dinner at A & A's and then rode
over to Dude's where I am now.</p>

<p>Dinner is on.</p>
