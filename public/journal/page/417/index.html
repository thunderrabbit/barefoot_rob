                        <p>Saw a sign for Hearst Castle.  I wonder if it's the castle that the
guy built out of coral and that I saw on TV many years ago?</p>

<p class=date>10:10am PST Tuesday 17 December 2002</p>

<p>Hearst Castle, upon first glance, looks nothing like a Castle.  But
I'm going in anyway.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Oh, this is the visitor's center.</p>

<p class=date>10:22am</p>

<p>Boring.  (sour grapes)</p>

<p>Or so I presume.  I talked to one of the cats in the visitor center
who said the tours just take a bus up to this castle and let people
look at different rooms.  Blah.  Bunch of warning signs "Tour 1
requires climbing over 150 steps, no refunds after boarding the bus")
blech.</p>

<p>And only $8.75 for a hot dog and drink at the fast food restaurant
thing.  Gag.</p>

<p>I'm chillin' by a dog named Java, apparently owned by a cat (and by
cat I mean docent) named Dick who is paid or maybe volunteers for an
elephant seal protetion foundation or some such.</p>

<p>Anyway, While poopooing Hearst Castle, driving north on the 1, I
saw an incredible blast of ocean crashing up and over a rock 75 feet
tall about 100 meters out from shore.  "I gotta see that" so I pulled
into the nearby "vista" like any other vista the 1 sports periodically
for ocean viewing.</p>

<p>Parked, walked toward the end of the  parking lot closer to this
mammoth rock, and lo, a man standing in the area said, "walk slowly,
there is a female seal wandering around."</p>

<p>??  "Sure, no problem."</p>

<p>Without conscious awareness of my location, I had come to Piedras
Blancas.</p>

<p>He invited/allowed me to take pictures of the seals from the other
side of the fence.  Big monster four-fucking-thousand pound elephant
seals, whose "get away from me or I'll kill you" bray sounds like a
motorcycle trying to start and drown at the same time.</p>

<p>I took a couple of .MOVies of them braying and harassing one
another, but since no females are yet ready to mate, the bloody
battles are not yet being waged.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Several other visitors have come to visit, and Dick is not able to
give them all the quality tour that I got, nor able to tell them to
chill the hell out and not walk like excited tourists so close to the
seals.</p>

<p>Ample signage tells people to be cool, but none have read it that
I've seen.</p>

<p>Out of battery power.  Gotta get charged soon.</p>

<p class=note>(written later:)</p>

<p>I took a brief nap by Java, a beautiful dark chocolate brown (maybe
coffee color, eh?) medium hair labrador(?) who was very excited for a
human visitor.  She got more excited when a rotweiller visitor came
nearby.  The owner didn't let them directly talk to one another.</p>

<p>Gave Dick my adventure card; thanked him for his time.  Learned
Java's name.</p>

                        <p class=date>12:44am PST Wednesday 18 December 2002</p>

<p>Thanks to Wende's map, I was able to find Lombardi street (that's
the curvy one) and ride to the Golden Gate Bridge (though I was not
able to cross it) in a few hour period.</p>

<p>Rode down Lombardi, brakes on hard all the way down the curvy red
bricks.  The next two hills are *steeper* than the curvy one it seems
and I was literally all, "holy shit" as I began to go down one of
them.  Big time brakes, and a bit scary cause the ground was wet;
would I slide???</p>

<p>Took Columbus (I think) toward the right, and marveled at the
trolley system in this place.  Cables run just beneath the street in a
hugemongous loop.  Trolley cars grab onto the cable when they want to
move.  The trolleys going down hills help lift the trolleys going up
hills, and maybe the trolleys slow down by feeding energy back into
the cable.  (I don't know if that's correct or not, though)</p>

<p>Rode along Beach, then Bay, then Marina which was dark(!) and
scary, as my bike has no lights right now.  Made it to the entrance of
the Golden Gate Bridge and immediately saw a sign saying No Bikes or
Motor-Driven Cycles.  I ignored the sign and rode up the sidewalk
thing, through some shallow puddles.</p>

<p>As I got about 1/2 a mile up the ramp it started to sprinkle and
get really windy.  I continued up until I saw another sign, something
like, "shoulder lane ends" or some shit that made me think my little
sidewalk was about to end.</p>

<p>"Fine."</p>

<p>So I gave a blessing to the bridge, turned around, rode back down,
gave a good wolf howl to the night sky.  Then I found myself facing
oncoming headlights so I could basically not see at all where I was
going.  Just trusted that no one would be coming up my sidewalk in
this weather, and if anyone did, that they would see me.</p>

<p>Made it to the bottom and began my trek back toward Wende's work.</p>

<p>I got back on Lombardi, intending this time to go <em>up</em> the
curvy hill instead of down.  Imagine my surprise when I got to the
curvy part and realized I was heading on it the same direction as
before!  Somehow I had gotten my brain turned around and thought I was
coming from the opposite direction.</p>

<p>I had just come up two pretty steep hills, and decided even though
I was at the top of Lombardi, I should roll down it again so I could
have the experience of riding up the hill.</p>

<p>A taxi had started down already, and I caught up with it before the
final three turns.  Maybe four.  At the bottom, I simply turned around
and headed back up.</p>

<p>Lombardi is a one way street.  I ended up stopping once to let a
car go past. (That was the only stop on all my uphills the entire
night.) Three cars total came down.  Maybe four.  I didn't stop for
any of the others, just veered out of their respective way.</p>

<p class=date>1:38am</p>

<p>I'm tired tired tired.</p>

<p>Um, made it back to Wende's work after getting kicked out of the
art musem park where I was simply sitting on a bench, waiting for her
to get off work.</p>

<p>Wrote some journal entrikes while waiting for her in her work.  Got
Scott, drove home, unloaded Scott, time for bed bed bed (well, couch
couch couch).</p>

<p>I'm leaving Sally's today.  Going to San Francisco to see Wende.</p>

<p class=date>9:57am</p>

<p>Hugs to Sally as she leaves for work; I'll see her again soon.</p>

<p>Tears in the kitchen after she's gone.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>It seems that I'm learning how to "leave" some place after having
been settled there.  Basically just get all my shit and leave.  Not
needing permission from the undefinable, which I've felt I needed in
the past.  Good to learn and grow.</p>

<p class=date>11:33am</p>

<p>Finished grocery shopping.  Restocked her kitchen a bit and got her
some new toothpaste.  Got the correct kind, all the way down to the
choice between "fresh mint" and "fresh mint gel"</p>

<p>To get the grocery discounts, I signed up for a Ralph's card and
put my city down as Marfa, Texas.  Made up a 77315 zip code.</p>

<p>Time to pack and get the flock outta here.</p>

<p class=date>1:18pm</p>

<p>Packed.  Loaded.  Bags, bike, skates, suit, everything.</p>

<p>2637 miles traveled since Dallas.</p>

<p>I've been on the road for a while and I'm right now passing a sign
for El Segundo, with the Tribe Called Quest song going through my
head.</p>

<p>I forgot to look at mileage exactly as I left Kinko's but oh well.</p>

<p>I'm a bit tired, but there's not many free rest areas to sleep,
plus I want to go more than 1 hour before stopping.</p>

<p>Oh, and it's rain rain raining.  Slow LA traffic allows me to type,
and use my computer to play the aforementioned song through my
cassette tape adapter and headphone port on computer.</p>

<p class=date>6:27pm</p>

<p>2713 miles traveled.  Spent a lot of time in LA traffic.</p>

<p>It's dark.  I have <em>just</em> exited the 101 to the 1 ("the"
instead of "highway" or "interstate" as is the local custom) and find
it almost deserted compared to what I had been on.  Parked on the side
to record the moment.  And check the map.  And pee.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Ooops.  I exited way earlier than I thought I had.  I'll still
scope out this beach and then go back to the 101.</p>

<p>I'm at El Capitan, a state park that is almost nothing like Emma
Wood beach.  But I haven't gone down to the beach yet, so maybe it
will be the same.</p>

<p>I don't know if I'll sleep a bit here, but I'm going to go explore
some in the dark.</p>

<p>Thank you for light, Three Quarter Moon!</p>

<p class=date>8:33pm</p>

<p>Okay, computer.  You're coming with me.  I have found a place that
I must explore more completely.  It's not exactly treacherous, but
it's definitely muddy, and two fences are asking me to stay away.  Or
maybe they are showing me where the real adventure is.  Okay, let's
go.</p>

<p class=date>8:44pm</p>

<p>Okay. I've made it past three fences (trivial; they are way old and
have been breached many times (not over or through, but since they
span just 20 feet, the newly beaten trail just goes around them)) and
down a nearly forgotten staircase descending a 45 degree slope of
slippery leaves and grasses to a wall asking me not to go past.  I
climbed around the wall, and am not going past that for the remainder
of my journey would be a fifty foot step down onto rocks over which
tumultuous water crashes and froths like a pancake mixer making
merangue.</p>

<p>There is one amazing sound that I'm hearing and can't quite place
it.  Sounds like stacatto drumbeats, but it's almost certainly the
waves, for it's coming from down below.  I wonder what it is.</p>

<p>I bet it's waves conking rocks together.</p>

<p class=date>9:12pm</p>

<p>I'm tired.  the metronomic crashing of waves and complete white
noise expeience soothes my brain.  I'd like to sleep here, but it's a
bit wet and muddy, and I'm being too prissy to get my sleeping bag all
mussed up.  And too wussy to sleep without it and freeze my ass
off.</p>

<p class=date>9:38pm</p>

<p><pBack inside Scott now.  Visited the lifeguard station, wondered if I
could break into it and borrow a 100 foot rope to rappel down the
cliff.  Decided against it.  (Especially when I saw the sticker
advising me that some alarm company protects the building.)  Though it
would be a lot of fun.</p></p>

<p>WOW. (font as big as The Hollywood Sign)</p>

<p>Holy cow wow.  I'm at Emma Wood State Beach in California.  Waves
come in toward the rocks not like one wave in, one wave out.  But like
wave in, another wave in, two waves in, then all out.  Wave wave wave,
out out out.  The resulting variance in water depth is enough to make
me shout with delicious fear that I'm trapped in a water horror movie
where the water will keep piling up until it consumes my body like a
bit of fluff.</p>

<p>Wind relentless from the northwest, blowing away all my heat and
all my shouts of joy at this incredible sight.  And how much more
incredible would it be if the sun shone brightly overhead instead of a
3/4 moon worth of light?</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I'm going to put more than T-shirt and shorts (and no shoes) on and
go back for more viewing.</p>

<p class=date>7:10pm</p>

<p>Wow.  I got cold pretty quickly, even with hoodie on.</p>

<p>I don't want to leave.  Could there possibly be anything more
beautiful and awesome in the world?</p>

<p>I'm going to drive up the 1 now for a ways and get back on the 101
when it feels right.</p>

<p>This is bizarre.</p>

<p>Second gas station that I've visited where I can't get gas.  Okay,
actually the first one just had signs saying "this product not
available" over both the low and mid grade gasoline.  They had the
high priced one available and I chose not to get it.</p>

<p>This second station has CAUTION ribbon around their entire gas pump
area.</p>

<p>Gasoline conspiracy?</p>

<p class=date>8:06pm</p>

<p>Okay I got gas at the third place, which looked perfectly normal,
except for one thing.  No Reese's Pieces!!!!</p>

<p>Neither were there Reese's Pieces at Ralph's went I went shopping!
What kinda of state is this where I can't get Reese's Pieces?</p>

<p>They got Reese's Cups, but no Reese's Pieces.  To punish them, I
purchase no candy at all.</p>

<p>Went sailing on a 30 foot Shields (sloop rigged keel boat) with
Sally and Jasmine today.</p>

<p>Jasmine's voice <em>and</em> laugh are *amazingly* like Danielle
Bartley from UH!  So incredible how similar they are.</p>

<p>Jasmine was the official skipper of our voyage to the seals and
back, but we all shared time at the tiller.</p>

<p>The seals were awake this time, and not bathed in sunlight until 5
minutes after we left their area.  I got several pics and two mpegs of
them.</p>

<p>Got pretty cold on the way back, and I had to pee pretty much a
lot.  We got back before the sun set, and before I had to go
overboard.</p>

<br>It would be &ldquo;at the tiller&rdquo; not &ldquo;at the keel&rdquo; (the keel is the big thing at the bottom of the boat) [fixed.  Thanks!]<br>
