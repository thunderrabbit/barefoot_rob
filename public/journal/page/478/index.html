<p>Oh my gosh I am thrilled at the phone call I just had with Chad.
I'm at KTRU right now, and I must say that I seem to have graduated
from KTRU.  I'm not in total thrillsville about it.  Not that every
thing in my life has to be completely amazing, but I feel that KTRU
and I have had a great time together and it's time for me to leave.
</p>

<p>I have one more shift that I'll be able to make - next week.  I
need to find a sub for the rest of my shifts this summer.  Instead of
sending an email out to the KTRU list for every shift, I decided to
call around and find someone.</p>

<p>My first call?  Chad.</p>

<p>Chad has been a DJ here for not quite a year I think.  He indicated
to Wende that he would enjoy it, so I totally encouraged him to
apply.  He got the job and every <em>(every)</em> time I've heard him
on the air, I've been way impressed with his style and DJ excellence!</p>

<p>Plus, he's fun and cool and all that, so I'm thrilled that he
agreed to cover the rest of my summer shifts!  He actually said,
"you're my brother so I can't say no."</p>

<p>"Aw man, Chad, you're makin' my day!"</p>

<p>"Don't start crying on me now.."</p>

<p>Funny.  I stretched the favor by a week and asked if he would join
me during my last shift next week, and he said yes!  whooo!</p>

<p>I intend to record it.</p>

<h3>State of My Life</h3>

<p>Right at this very moment I sit in my apartment during the garage
sale I'm having.  One person has visited and bought a set of shelves
and 4 books.  My $/customer ratio is excellent!</p>

<p>Three more hours to go: plenty of time to have more folks
visit.</p>

<p>In a week-sized scale, I'm selling my stuff and moving out of my
apartment, intending to allow someone to take over my lease ($760)
until December 31.  I placed an ad in the Houston Press a couple weeks
ago, and got a few phone calls, but nothing confirmed.  Just today I
placed an ad in the Houston Chronicle, which will run from Tuesay 9
July to Monday 22 July.</p>

<p>I've been archiving stuff that I hope to come back to when I've
finished travelling (sp), choosing some stuff to come with me,
releasing the rest, either selling or giving to friends and
neighbors.</p>

<p>On a month-sized scale, I'm closing in on the final days in
Houston.  I lost my job in June and half-heartedly looked for a job,
found nothing, decided to travel.  My ex-company wasn't bringing in
enough $ to afford all of us, so they let some people go to 1/2 time.
They knew I was intent on leaving at the end of the year, so they let
me go all the way.  "Whoohooo!!" and "Oh no!!  now what???"</p>

<p>On a year-sized scale, I was engaged to marry Wende on 21 June
2002.  We had been engaged since 29 February 2000, but I started to
get freaked and broke up with her in early September 2001.  I realized
that I have to travel and see (much) more of the world before I can
settle.</p>

<p>I applied to be a youth group tour-guide to lead high school youth
overseas, but I didn't have enough in-country experience to be
accepted (I applied with US Experiment).  So, I've decided to teach
English in Japan for a year or two.  Then I'll have enough in-country
experience to lead trips to Japan.</p>

<p>I will also have approximately 1 million other opportunities be
made available to me, so I'm not tied to simply giving youth group
tours to Japan.  That's in the multiple-years-away-future; I don't
have a lot of plans for that far out.</p>

<p>Emotionally, I'm scared and excited and forging new experiences for
myself.  Learning a lot about how I act and react in different
situations; discovering new qualities about myself.</p>

<p>I can't quite put these into words yet.</p>

Rob-

thanks.

you are totally allowed to be scared.  and you are
totally allowed to have doubt.  don't ignore those
feelings, because those are the feelings that you have
to... conquer?  i want to say you have to, like, beat
their asses.  because i know you can.  if you feel
fear, take it be afraid, and use that as a motivating
power.  "if i am afraid that i will not have the
money, i will immediately change my life so that i
will have the money"..."if i am doubting that my new
life will work, i will make sure before i step into
the new reality that i have a firm ground to walk on."


i have esentially sacrificed my social wants and needs
for this summer.  i work two jobs full time so that
when i get to london i will be able to play and feel
safe and not rely on my parents.  i am totally afraid
of being broke and having to ask them for funds, so i
am making them now.  i guess its all about looking at
the big picture, which is often times hard to see.

and i like that you "hate to do it" because that means
you're stretching.  like, a weird yruu spin to all of
this is something i've beAn like putting into every
part of my life lately...  the five steps to community
building are so a bigger thing then that, like... look
at it as the five steps to self-building.  you have
bonded with yourself, you are open and honest about
how you feel with yourself, and you don't deny that
you have those feelings, you are affirming all of your
emotions and trying to feel at ease with them, but now
you are at another time in your life when you have to
stretch, and when you embark on this crazy journey
(althogh it has in many ways begun), you will share
deeper with yourself than you ever have.  maybe thats
a stupid metaphor... but i think about it all the
time.  like "what step am i on in this relationship,
or am i ready to start the next step with this person"
etc.  

its fucking hard and bloody amazing to do what you are
doing.  and remember that it is not the norm, and so
people may not understand, but thats ok.  because you
have to understand.  you know what your goals are
(hopefully) by this point, and i know you will meet
and surpass them all.  you can't just let life guide
you on this, it takes a lot of work to make it all
happen, and literally the more work you can do now, to
ease your transitions, the better it will be later.

i know you will make it, and in the end you will walk
away with a smile on your face.

i love you
smiles,
me

You have to leave your home and can only take 20 things with you.
What would you take?
</pre>

<p>That's the game I'm playing now.  What do I take on my trek?  What
will I need?  What will keep me entertained?  What won't I need?</p>

<p>I've got all this shit in my apartment, and all these mental ties
to it.  Memories tied up all over the place and promises kept to
people (I'll give this [book|software|music|unicycle] back to you when
I'm done) and a whole pile of question marks in my mind.</p>

<p>And I've got this sneak preview garage sale from 4 to 7pm and then
I remembered I'm going to yoga at 3pm..  Haven't taken a shower..
Oooky poopy bluh.</p>

<p>And then my other fear is that no one will show up.  I trust that
everything will work out nicely.  I know Maggie plans to be here at 5
or 5:30.  Maybe no one will really come until then, so I can get some
more clearing/sorting/cleaning done before people arrive.</p>

<p class=date>8:28pm</p>

<p>Yoga helped my peace.  I arrived there 15 minutes early, got in a
full 45 minute session.  Learned a pose called Warrior #3 (I think it
was 3), a sideways lean pose, and a version of Sun Salutation that is
easy on the wrists cause my left wrist is still not optimal.</p>

<p>Stopped by Randall's and got some Ritz Bits crackers 2 for 1.</p>

<p>Arrived back at my apartment at 4:04 and medicated some by eating
crackers to keep from focusing on my concern that no one would come.
Crackers and soy milk.  Mmmmmm.</p>

<p>Maggie and Kerry (sp) were the first to arrive at 5:15 or so, I
think.  Maybe it was 4:45, but around 5.  Dennis came many minutes
after them.  I'm thankful that I could provide some shelving and desk
for Kerry, books and a cat house for Dennis, an end table for Maggie,
and CDs for all.  So awesome.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Super wonderful duper special thanks to Kerry for treating Maggie
and me to Star Pizza!  We each got a 12" preceded by the baked goat
cheese.  Goat cheese.  Mmmmmm.</p>

<p>Have just arrived back home from Star; I walked Maggie to her car
and chatted a bit, told her how scared I've been and how much I'm
learning and stretching.  She drove off and I realized I had forgotten
my phone at Star, so I walked back.  When I came inside, I said, "I'm
returning this pizza; naw just kidding..."</p>

<p>On second thought it would have been funnier to say, "I've got a
pizza delivery!"</p>

<p>Chillin' at Molly and Will's house with them, Anna, Maggie, and
Wende.  Squeaky fireworks swirling and popping all around the house.
Scout is a bit nervous by all the ruckus.</p>

<p>Wende's describing the story where she hurt her back while using a
crowbar to open the safe at her work.  She's become famous throughout
the company for this.</p>

<p>Official report: "Wende needs to be more careful and aware when
opening the safe."</p>

<p>Earlier we played bocci (sp), the highlight of which was the round
where each of four players threw both our balls at the same time, for
a grand total of eight lovely arcs clicking and thumping.</p>

<p>I am studying japanese, and I was hoping I could practice my
japanese characters in emacs, but I don't see how to get it to display
them.  It seems unaffected by ctrl-space, which switches the input
language in other applications.</p>

<p>Doh.  when I try to simply write hiragna in a different buffer and
paste them to emacs, it killed the emacs process.</p>

<p>hmmm.</p>

<p>Oh my gosh. I've been signing things as the 2nd of July.  Hmm.  Oh
well.</p>

<p>This morning I helped Wende get some boxes to her storage unit and
get my desk and end table out of her storage unit.  Then used her home
phone to call AAA and sign up for their roadside assistance plan in
preparation for my adventure.</p>

<p>Wandered around slightly aimlessly; this will take some getting
used to.  I visited First Unitarian Church on Fannin, looking to say
HI to Gail the minister, but she wasn't there.  I was also hoping to
find some free food there, but none was readily available.</p>

<p>Went to Suzanne's work, but decided not to bug her, so I went to
the Clayton Library across the street.  Looked for my mom's parents in
the 1930 census, but couldn't find them.  I assume they were in
Louisiana, and I think I used the soundex correctly, but didn't find
them.</p>

<p>Left the library and saw a tour bus going to visit Suzanne's work,
and lo, there was Suzanne outside her work, greeting them.  So I
merged in with the group and said HI to her while she greeted the rest
of the group.  She invited me in so I stayed for a bit and had a
tomato from someone's garden.</p>

<p>Now I'm at Wende's work, where I'll go to lunch with her.</p>

<p>I got an HIV test after saying HI to Suzanne.  I found that if I
get blood work done, I can get a free juice or cookie.  Got a pint of
orange juice.  It's free except that I paid $40 for the test.</p>

<p>Maybe I'll give plasma.  Need I have to have a legal residence to
do that?  Hmmm.</p>

Gem!

There's a big ass storm up here in Denton.  What's the weather like
where you are?  I've woken up the last couple of mornings and tuned
into the local weather reports (as I usually do) before leaving for
work.  But, I feel a loss because:

1) the ABC weatherman is fully dressed
2) I haven't just woken up beside him, and (mostly)
3) he's not you!!!

What can I say?  I miss you already.  It looks like the New Orleans
rally is a no-go.  Still, my boss gave me the 4th and 5th off.  Bonus!
My friends and I can celebrate Independence Day right.  Don't know
what we're doing yet, but we'll come up with something.  Hope you have
a great week (or three) until I see you again.
</pre>

<p>She calls me Gem because we have the same birthdate (5 years apart)
and are therefore twins (Gemini), and she treasures me (gem =
treasure)</p>

<p>I can feel myself drawn to her since she likes me, but I predict
the relationship would end badly/prematurely if we start getting
physical this soon.  I've known her only since April.</p>

Rob!

GA ended exactly a week ago and I have beAn home since
last thursday, but kT was there!  she didn't put
anything in the mugbook either, but she is spending
the summer in brooklyn so i assume thats where she is
now?!

GA was awesome and a totally needed break from
pressures at home that were mounting.  so everything
is just awesome!  A good friend that i made at GA from
Ohio, Chris Weber (on steering committee and very
cool) is probably going to come to swuusi!  he is also
friends with sean, laura d., and abbey tennis so we
are all excited about it!

other than that i am working just about full time at
two jobs and rocking it out as much as i can when i'm
not working.  i'm about to meet a bunch of girlfriends
for dessert so i need to go but i love you heaps and
will see you in less than three weeks!
woo hoo!
smiles,
me

| Bryn!
| 
| I got your card from GA yesterday; thank you so much
| for that!  I would 
| like to send kT a card; if you get this before the
| end of GA (today?) will 
| you ask her what is the optimal address to send it?
| 
| I'm still in my apartment; it's not rented out yet,
| but it's 90% likely 
| that Dave from my ex-work will take over my lease. 
| I have bought an ad in 
| Houston Press, which should hit the streets in two
| days.  Dave is also 
| going to buy my bed and blue recliner.  I will place
| ads for selling my 
| futon and chest of drawers and desk.
| 
| I get internet access free of charge from Kinko's,
| which is right across 
| the freeway from me, so it's closer than my work
| was.
| 
| I'll enjoy talking with you about plans while we're
| at SWUUSI.
| 
| I'll reply more to this email later, probably
| tonight.
| 
|     With Love
|     - Rob!!

Bryn, thank you for inspiring me to excel.

Slowly, I am learning to do it for myself.

Far more times than you are aware, your past encouragement has echoed
through my mind in times of stress, sadness, fear.  "Rob, you can do it."

I love you for it, and part of me hates to do it; you encourage me to
not settle for less.

Thank you for being you.  Thank you for being real with me.

In the past several days my fear of leaving my apartment, of making
this big change happen in my life has seemed overwhelming.  My debt
(which is actually small) seems huge.  My resources seem tiny.  I know
it's all just a skewed perspective, but the feeling is very real to
me.

During college, I created Recycling Day, which ultimately was a huge
success.  It was difficult.  This project that I'm creating now
doesn't have a name yet, but it seems just as large, maybe larger.
I'm learning how to use the resources around me, those in the 'real'
world instead of just those in the protection of the university
campus.

I keep reminding myself I've gotten a lot done.  I trust in the higher
resources of the world.  Tomorrow I'm going to wake up early and sit
meditatively.  Just to see how that positively affects my day.

    With Love Love Love
     - R O B

ps: I'm thrilled that GA was such a blast for you!  I look forward to
seeing you and all the continental peeps at SWUUSI!

<p class=dream>I was living back in our house that I lived in from 3rd
to 7th gread.  I had packed all my laundry and my mom took it
somewhere and I couldn't find it.  I scoured through the house
multiple times, but it was not there.  My mom thought maybe she had
accidentally taken it out as garbage.</p>

<p class=dream>So I went outside and walked down the street a bit to a
neighbor's house and saw bags of trash.  I went up toward their house
and discovered that they were throwing away a huge amount of clothes.
Some T-shirts and some button up shirts.</p>

<p class=dream>The apparent owner of the clothes was behind a wall
with a window on it.  I got his attention (the window was tinted or
stained glass or something) and he was DJing on some turntables.  I
talked to him a bit and he said I could have some of the button up
shirts.</p>

<p class=dream>Then we were walking or riding a bus and it turns out
that I had heard of him; his DJ name was Mussimaxx or something.  He
was pleased and impressed hat I had heard of him.</p>

<p class=dream>Then I was walking along a highway and noticed a
balloon being wafted along each time a car drove by.  I could see
clearly the turbulence caused by each car.  The sun shone brightly and
it was hot.  I stayed in the shade as much as possible, though there
wasn't much shade to be found.</p>

<p class=dream>Came to an old abandoned watering hole, with a small
amount of mucky water in the bottom.  I wasn't thirsty enough to drink
any of it, but I wondered if I ever would be.</p>
