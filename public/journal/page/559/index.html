<p>Wow!  Wende and I are minding our own business at
Souper Salad when a lovely familiar face walked
up.</p>

<p>"Um, um, um," I stammered, "Michelle!"</p>

<p>"HI!" she smiled.</p>

<p>"I totally  had a dream about you within the last
month or so!"</p>

<p>She is married and living out in the country with
their lovely baby and two dogs and two cats.</p>

<p>Her husband is working with plants and is quite
successful and loves it.  So great!!</p>

<p>We exchanged information and gave her the short
version of our lives.</p>

<p>Oh!  This is Michelle whose ex-boyfriend Patrick
was in my dream a couple nights ago.  The dream where
he found Mr Spot.</p>

<p>Today at work I convinced some old crappy code (*) to display three extra
oh-so-important questions on a survey.  The code was hardcoded everywhere
the number of questions in the survey.</p>

<p>My new G3 code will totally replace this project, but they need this one
done sooner than my G3 might be ready.  Whatever.  I just updated the source
library, compiled the shit and got it online.</p>

Subject:  Alicia stranded

Hey Rob,

Got a call from Alicia whose SW flight to St Louis was
cancelled and 
she's 
stranded at Hobby...I had given her the only 2 numbers
I have, hope one 
of 
them works. It's 727pm and she should be around SW
airlines...hope you 
can 
rescue her and she can have quality time with her step
bro and sis to 
be!

Let me know if anything transpires

<p class=date>9:28pm</p>

<p>Alicia is my step sister.  She's 16 or so. I
checked my messages right after I saw this message as
I was about to leave from work.  She had called but
didn't leave a pay phone number or anything.  I expect
she'll be fine.  If something else happens, I'll write
about it!</p>

Subject:  Re: [sns_ultimate] Centex this weekend!

Sean's taunting yesterday about *not* going to Centex
made me decide hell yeah I'm going to go!

HOWEVER, the site says that registration is completely
closed.

I snooze; I looze.

I know they don't check IDs at the gate; what's the
group consensus on me just coming anyway?  

I guess I wouldn't get a shirt if they counted them
out precisely and therefore I wouldn't get to play
with the team and that would suck.  Hmm.

Yeah, I'm a dork.

     Wonder!!!
</pre>

<p class=date>9:21 Wednesday 14 March 2001</p>

<p>Oh my gosh is it really that late?</p>

<p>Yes it is.</p>

<p>Subsequent emails indicate that it's the
<em>team</em> registration that has closed, not
individual registration.  In fact, there is no
indiidual registration so it's all good.</p>

<p>Bill asked if I can still be the dork.  I
understand that he needs someone to share the
honor.</p>

<p>But Jerry said it best:</p>

<p>So anyway, I've been at work most all day today and
been mostly working all day at work today which is a
novel concept after my last couple of days of not
really working, but sorta working.  Today I'm actually
coding another module of the G3 Project, the latest
and greatest incarnation of the original huge project
I worked on months ago.</p>

<p>I've been listening to NIN (halos fourteen and
sixteen) for the past couple of hours. (I just found
out yesterday that I missed the release of halo
fifteen altogether.</p>

<p>Wende made me the most lovely and caring lunch in
the entire planet today - homemade tuna noodle,
grapes, and holiday colored Reeses Pieces, alll packed
in a Winnie the Pooh thermal lunch bag.</p>

<p class=date>2:29am CST Tuesday 13 March 2001</p></p>

<p>It's now 2:54am.  I just spent 25 minutes writing the following
notes from my dream.  I probably won't convert them into a pretty
format; there's enough long paragraphs to satisfy me.</p>

<p>The first part I'm just capturing snippets, then I wrote some
more.</p>

<p>The notebook referenced twice below was a pocket folder with 3
brads in it, not rings.</p>

<p>I thought the owl bite part of the dream was real, and I went
inside to get the paper to write down my experience.</p>

<p>"wene" is supposed to be "Wende"</p>

<p>"riber" is supposed to be "river"</p>

<p>"$4.46" and then I spelled the correct amount out because I knew it
was likely I hit the wrong keys.</p>

<p>The "0 0 0" is me trying to separate with "- - - -"</p>

<p>(Okay, now it is 3:02am; here is what I actually wrote after waking
up from my dream:)</p>

<pre>
owl bite finger upside down tree

inside and the back outside to play some more

bite was real

back inside to write down my journal  and then looking for a notebook
looking at the mess in my apartment

Spot didn't come back inside when I offered.

I was naked by the counter, putting pater in my 3 ring not  3 brad
notebook

patrick came home and was all announcemtn link "guess who just found
Sp

guess who I u just found?  Mr Spot!"  and e let spot inside and I was
all come on in but I 'm naked.  I was actually leaning so he could
only see my booty booty and he  complimented meon how clean my place
looked compared to his, but Michelles was a mess so that is all he
cared about.  "I Love that you guys are competing on that.  I love
it."

They used to be apartent mates in the apremtne next to me.




I woke p when wene was wiggling in bed.  

- - - - - - 

speeding down a riber, trying not oto hit all the turtles that were
sunning themselves on rockes.  big turtles too, big eough to  dent the
bottom of the boat.  4 fee  2 foot across turtles.  as  some
leatherback sea turtles, some galapagos big totoises.  I was trying to
catch up with someone to have them marvel at the wildlife, but I
realized I had to just let them go do what thye wanted so ** slowed
down.  I marveled even more tat the big turtles as I slowed down, and
the little bitty fish and a huge big angel fish! oh my gosh it was
like 1 foot tall  and it nibbled at the side of my lef and OW!  That
pactically hurt!  I moved my legs out of the water and he still poked
his head out of the water to nible.  

I saw an otter, and another otter.  I was scared they might bite me,
but they ddi not.  Very thankful to have slowed down to take the time
to look at the wildw lofe.

Hanging upside down in a tree, I climbed wile upside down in this treI
was specificaly upisde down (almost slept at the I) and looking
carefuly at the bark and branches to see how to pull myslef up.  I was
awaret hat my legs were above me and I needed to manuever them around
a tree banch in order to clmb higher.  I got them around (under0
branch and was actaually lower thatn I meant to be after that
manuever.  It took some strength to hold myself upside down like
this.  

I saw a little baby owl in the tree, adn it tried to bite me and like
clamped down on my  around my knuckle as if to  bit the entire
knuckele off, but it just left a diamond shape cut around my whollle
knuckles.  he didn't rip any flesh off my finger.  whew.

I got down out of the tree to go upstairs in my apartment and write
down my experience in my journal.    Then some friends came over so
was just upstairs to grab some paper in a notepad folder and was
putting the papter in the foler when Patrick brought Spot in for me.  

- - - -

Dude and I worked near the same bplace, for different departments in
the same company.  He worked for Robert W, my old boss.  Dude was
showing me some stuff he had learned, and I needed to get back to work
so I watched him only for a bit longer.  Then I walked back to my desk
and there were actually two computers, each were shaped like a video
game car racing game where the player ets in to "drive"  .  A girl
wanted to log in a check her email so she asked me about it and i said
it was possible, and according to the computer cost  $4.46  (four
thirty-five) tjust to log in.  I thought that amount was a bit high,
so I logged in and lter her use my accounte.  account.  It took me a
whle to figure out how to log in; I was at the C:\ prompt and and
finally was able to log in.  There was another guy who wanted to use
the other computer, but I didn't want to let him use it; I wanted to
use at least <em>one</em> of the computers.

I left the area to go home and  something .. I talked to someon in the
parking lot and then I was on the river speeding across it, ignoring
the wild life at first.  Then the whole sunfsh thing happened. 

Then the thig with the owl and I was going to write it down

<p>I decided to purchase a new stowaway keyboard after my first one was run
over by a roller coaster and no longer latches very effectively.  The new
keyboard arrived today, but the C key doesn't work very well, so I'm sending
it back.</p>

<p class=date>2:28pm</p>

<p>Actually I'm going to carefully attempt to take it apart to see if I can
find a physical reason that it's not working well.  If it's a piece of dirt
or fuzz in the way, I can fix that.</p>

<p class=date>3:09pm</p>

<p>awww yeah.  I fixed it.  I didn't really see a problem.  I removed the F
key as well, and it looked the same.  However, by taking the C key off and
wigglin' around its guts, it works quite nicely now.  Yay!!  It was quite a
trick to get the keys back on.  I'm glad it's not my job to do so each
day.</p>

<p>Big fun at ultimate tonight.  This is the first time I've played in
a pretty long time.  It's been so long that I forgot to wear my
contacts instead of glasses.  It's been so long that when I saw Kim,
who has short red hair, I thought it was Kat and that she had recently
cut her hair.</p>

<p>I played super well; even if I had been there consistently I would
have approved of my skillz tonight.</p>

<p>One cruddy attempt at a catch resulted in the disk slamming into
the tip of my middle finger, lifting the first 2 mm or so of
fingernail.  It bled some and it still hurts, but it's not too
terribly bruised.</p>

<p>Got to better meet Tamara, who came out to UH on Saturday night
some weeks ago when Madeline also came out to watch.  She wore no
shoes tonight because she forgot her cleats.  When she stepped
thoroughly on a burr in the grass she decided it was really time to go
home (she had been saying she needed to go home for a while at that
point).</p>

<p>This weekend is Centex in Austin.  I don't know if I'll go or not.
Wende will be out of town for SWUUSI meeting, which makes me lean more
toward going to Centex.</p>

<p>I came home from work early today (around 1pm)
because Wende came home sick from her work.  I decided
it would be more pleasant to sleep in a suitably
snuggly fashion than to be at work.</p>

<p>I will work from/at home tonight.</p>

<p>I'm leaving for I-group now.</p>

<p>Wow!</p>

<p>For the past 30 or so rallies, my mugbook quote has
been a line from Pulp Fiction.  This has been true for
all but like 4 rallies out of 30.</p>

<p>While registering for Plano Rally, I was scanning
through the script to find a line.  I found in the
opening scene, when they decide to rob the coffee
shop, the woman's line is "I'm ready, let's go, right
here, right now."</p>

<p>However, that's what's written in the script; I
want  the line she actually says.  I put in the VHS
and was watching the scene when I heard the most
amazing thing.</p>

<p>(This is for trivia buffs or Pulp Fiction junkies
only)</p>

<p>When she says, "I bet you could cut down on the
hero factor in a place like this."</p>

<p>In the background, Jules says, "Well yeah!  I was
eatin' my muffin, drinkin' my coffee, an' replayin'
the incident in my mind, when I had what alcoholics
refer to as, 'a moment of clarity.'"</p>

<p>So perfect!  Just as she says "no hero," our hero
speaks up in the background.  Awesome.</p>

<p class=date>4:34am CST Saturday 10 March 2001</p></p>

<p>We just played Silent Foot Ball for a few hours.  "We" = youth of
HAC YAC.</p>

<p>Funny names: Phat Pat was something then Ms Doctor Octagon.
<br>Katherine was Miss Crazy Girl
<br>Gram (sp) was Mister Miss Crazy Girl Sucks, and his name morphed over the
game to Mister Miss Crazy Girl Hiccup Hawking Sucks Wrong Racecar Dot
Com
<br>Amy was Miss Camoflauge (sp)
<br>Lauren was Miss Penguin, then something else
<br>Meg was Miss Meg Works I Thought My Name was Workshop</p>

<p class=date>1:54 pm</p>

<p>During the game we also used the four added Foot Ball motions to
move the football.</p>

<p>The game deteriorated into a fit of giggles when Katherine was
speaking German, Betsy spoke in French, Phat Pat spoke in Spanish,
then Meg said it was too much for her head at 4am.  Then Katherine
spoke in Pig Latin, but she was accidentally doing Pig Latin on words
in German.  Very funny.  We were very tired.</p>
