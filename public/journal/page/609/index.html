<p><p>Took a 3 hour lunch today, and have been mostly reading since I got back.  I have not, however, been mostly reading work-related stuff, but email, BBST, and found an interesting site <a href="https://www.selectsmart.com/RELIGION">www.selectsmart.com/RELIGION</a></p>

<p><p>At lunch, Ma and Aunt Madeleine met me and Wende at The Container Store, and we walked over to Souper Salad to munch.   They watched and talked while Wende and I ate.  M &amp; M had just eaten breakfast.  Talked mostly about genealogy which they had uncovered while going through Monner&rsquo;s (their mom) scrapbooks and stuff.</p>

<p><p>When Wende had to go back to work, I was all, <em>doh!!  they still want to come see the house!</em></p>

<p><p>I led the 2-car caravan, and they were definitely impressed with our homestead. Pet the cats, talked about nothin&rsquo; and toured the place.  Then back to work and I&rsquo;ll drive up to 1960 to visit Bill and Evelyn with whom they are staying tonight.</p>

<p class=date>written 6:12am CDT Friday 21 July 2000</p></p>

<p><p>On Wednesday, my almost-sister Elise came over after work so she
could spend the night and go back to work early the next morning.  I
enjoy having her over because she&rsquo;s my sister, almost, and I&rsquo;ve never
had a sister this close before (Karina and Alicia are officially
moreso my sisters, but I don&rsquo;t see them as much).  I have sisters!!
Wow!</p>

<p><p>Wednesday is also ultimate day, so I invited Elise to play.  She
did, and it was great!  She did remarkably well for having never
thrown a disc before!  She quickly modified her throws, with no verbal
suggestions from anyone - she just watched and changed her technique
amazingly quickly!</p>

<p><p>I neglected to tell her to bring shoes though; she brought her
sandals (do those Adidas things count as sandals?  more like flip
flops to me) and obviously couldn&rsquo;t run quickly in those.  As quickly
as she honed her tosses, she ripped a huge blister in her big toe.
Ow!!  She wanted it taped so she could play more.  Thanks to Meek for
tape, and she did play more.</p>

<p><p>After the game, Wende and I supported the bandaging of her toe.  I
washed, and Wende got the bandaids and neosporin.  (note: there was no
blood, or I would have brought her home immediately for doctoring.  It
was just that a big floppy flap of the dead skin had ripped off.  She
still had a thin layer of skin intact.)  In an attempt to shift her
experience of the pain, I pointed out the fact that she still had a
layer of skin; no nerves were cut or actually exposed, just relatively
much closer to the surface than they had been.  She was quite brave.</p>

<p><p>All clean then sent Elise down to the guest bedroom to sleep with
the cats.  Goodnight!</p>

<p class=note>dream</p>

<p><p class=dream>I feel like I&rsquo;ve been dreaming for hours that I&rsquo;ve been late for work, as a result of watching TV and pissing around all day.   A small amusement park thing that I owned or was renting on someone else&rsquo;s land..</p>

<p><p class=dream>and I needed to get my dad&rsquo;s advice on something, but he wasn&rsquo;t available so I was relaxing outside, looking up at some apartments and a guy looked down and saw me and asked if I was going to watch the game and I was all no that I didn&rsquo;t have internet access.</p>

<p><p class=dream>then it just kept getttng later and later and more futile to go to work until it was six am the next day  and I was sill trying to go to work from monday though it was  six am tuesday now.   I had the feeling that I had to make it up, but finally I was just &ldquo;forget it&rdquo; and I told my dad my decision and woke up..</p>

<p><p>oh so relieved!</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m chillin&rsquo; in the warrior lodge before my men&rsquo;s group.  Good stuff each Monday night.</p>

<p><p>Today at work I didn&rsquo;t do a whole lot of work, but read some different SAS stuff and surfed the &lsquo;net and played on the <a href="https://www.geeky-boy.com/cgi-bin/bbs_thingie">BBS Thingie</a> on geeky-boy.com.</p>

<p><p>We started a discussion on theology and stuff.  I tossed into the pile 3 different theories of the structure of God in the universe, but none of them really seem to be what I&rsquo;m guessing must be &lsquo;reality&rsquo;.</p>

<p><p>Mostly I just wonder about us here now.. what are we to do while alive here on earth?  [shrug]</p>

<p><p>One of the men in our group checked-out permanently.  He&rsquo;ll be missed.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p></p>

<p><P class=dream>I was at work, and Deborah was verifying that she had
our correct SSNs so that we could start having our checks direct
deposited into our accounts.  While she had the work financial numbers
near my desk, I noticed a line that said &ldquo;35 million shares
outstanding.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>&ldquo;Kevin,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;what is the deal with all these
shares?&rdquo;  &ldquo;Are there shares out there that no one can purchase?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>He was all, &ldquo;I have no control over what people can
buy.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>So I decided to do some reseearch to see why our 35
million shares were &lsquo;out there&rsquo; but not available for purchase.  Went
back to my work computer, where my computer mouse was in a tangle of
wires, reducing my productivity.. I felt rushed to get home before
Wende got home at 1pm cause I told her I would be at home.  In anger,
I yanked the mouse to try pulling its cord free of the other wires,
(it partially worked) and then I noticed it was already 1:20pm.</p>

<p><p class=dream>So I wrote a quick note to myself and on the screen:
&ldquo;Research IPOs&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>I grabbed two slices of pizza that were left on my desk
cause I felt like I shouldn&rsquo;t waste them.  I was munching one on the
way out the door, then I realized I was just about to eat lunch, and I
didn&rsquo;t have to &lsquo;save money&rsquo; by eating this pizza.  I mentally blessed
my life to be abundant enough to bring me food whenever I need it. I
threw the pizza into the trashcan on the way out of the building (big
open building with lots of windows and floors of dark roughly cut
rock) and I even spit out the piece that I had in my mouth.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Burst out into the parking lot (which happened to be
the parking lot of my old church) and there was Spot!  With intention
to scoop him up and take him hoome, I was all, &ldquo;Spot?&rdquo; but it wasn&rsquo;t
him.  So I zipped on past to my car.  Got in my car and the scene
melted into me being at home, and I woke up.</p>

<p><p>Today Wende is supposed to be home earlier than usual, about 4pm.</p>

<p><p>Only 9 people showed up for ultimate tonight, and for a significant time we only had 6.  So Bill showed us a new game call Boo- something.  Field like the following:</p>

<pre>
                   *    *
     
     
     
     
     
 -----------*----------------------------*--------------
     
     
 -----------*----------------------------*--------------
     
     
     
     
     
                   *    *
</pre>

<p><p>Legend:
<pre>
* = a cone  (near the top and bottom are &ldquo;goal&rdquo; cones.<br />
    The cones with &mdash; through them are just markers
&mdash;&mdash; = imaginary lines
</pre></p>

<p><p>Two teams, three players each.  The object of the game is to
accumulate points.  A team accumulates points by knocking over a
goal-cone.  If a team drops the frisbee, the other team immediately
plays, but has to move the frisbee past one of the imaginary lines
before knocking over a goal-cone.</p>

<p><p>We played two games of 3-on-3, and one game of 4-on-4.  All three
games were fun and challenging.  (It seemed to work equally well with
the different team sizes.</p>

<p><p>Then we got one more player and played actual ultimate, with
4-on-5.  I was on the four player team, and happily, we won.  I left
after that and here I am!</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>playing ultimate and the game had just ended but I hadn't plalyed yet.   people were leaving  to go see movies.  then my brother walked up unexpected, wearing a big smile, "like I'm here; let's play ultimate!"

<p class=dream>People had just arrived and started to line up to play.  I was in great anticipation of playing against Fred, I expected he would be better player than me.

<p class=dream>As we waited to play, the field converted to the inside of a dorm room / shrine to Rocky Horror Picture Show.

<p class=note>(dream 2)</p>

<p><p class=dream>8.10am  in a bar type place with my dad, and getting food out of a vending machine.  not like candy, but entrees from the menu. I put in a penny, and the penny was not accepted, but the money counter would register a dime had been put in.  So we loaded the machine with a lot of pennies, bought a single burrito, and then had a bunch of extra golden dollars that I could hand out to people.  there was a little girl watching all of them come out, and she &lsquo;stole&rsquo; one (can you steal stolen money?) and I told her she could have it if she let me tell her about sacagawea and the coin and stuff.    then I woke up.  (is it stealing if I steal in my dream?)</p>

<p><p>As I type this, I&rsquo;m at KTRU!!  Super cool that the
DJ before me has keys to the office and left it open
for me to check email and stuff during my show!</p>

<p><p>Calls tonight have been infrequent, but I&rsquo;ve had a
pretty good rate of finding the requests that have
been requested.  I got TWO requests for the same
(local) band tonight. I&rsquo;m sure that was a
collaborative effort to get airplay for their band.  I
can appreciate that, but I&rsquo;m only playing one song by
them, thank you!!<br />
<br>Along the same concept, I got a call this week for
an exact song I played last week by request.  I think
it was the same caller too.  Sorry, holmes.. not going
to play it again this week.</p>

<p><p>Most of my show has been random grab-type stuff,
except for a few requests and a couple of CDs that I
like and which caught my eyes.</p>

<p><p>After KTRU, ultimate!!!</p>

<p>Doh!  I left my paycheck at work yesterday.  (we get paid on the 14th and the last day of the month)

<p>Me an' Wen's plan for the day is to get up now and she'll skate, I'll ride my unicycle.  then we'll come inside and put together some new Skandia drawers she got (we're going to put our CDs in the drawers)

<p>I'd like to go see a matinee after that, before KTRU tonight and then ultimate after that!

<p class=date>5:05pm</p>

<p><p>no movie, but we&rsquo;re chillin&rsquo; at Pottery Barn, where a Sabita-look-alike (named Alisa) with a red streak in her hair  (shhh) is helping us.  She just brought out the curtain rods that will go into our guest bedroom.</p>

<p><p>Oh, and we&rsquo;re getting sheer curtains with insects embroidered into them.  Met Alisa when she was customer-helping as I looked through a funny funny book about kids getting into mischievious situations.  Funniest one is making a fart-sound-producing device that they used in class at a catholic school and drove their teacher to quitting.  not funny that she quit, but fart-noise maker sounds really funny.</p>

<p><p>Oh, and we got three drawers made and filled with CDs.  Don&rsquo;t have the equipment yet for the other 4.</p>

<p><p>Elise and I just sorted all the CDs by artist name.  They had been
sorted by genre (and not by artist at all (except that artists tend to
stick to a specific genre)), which Wende and I decided was not the
optimal way for us, considering how relatively few CDs we had for so
many genres.</p>

<p><p>Now they are sorted: first soundtracks (movies and TV) sorted by
name, then artists, then various artists compilations, sorted by name
of album.</p>
