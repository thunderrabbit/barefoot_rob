<p>No other advisors made it down to the lake, so we went back up to
touch group meetings at 6:pm.</p>

<p>Cabin 6 is my touch group, starring Edward Decker, John from
Witchita, David M from Houston, Chris from Houston, Edward L from San
An, Troy W from same place Edward is from, and I don't remember the
rest now.</p>

<p>So flattering that Edward said the games I know are more fun than
those that were listed in the Touch Group leader manual!  So I showed
them how to play Detective, Dead Fish, Captain Video, Swedish Drinking
Game.  (not in that order).  I'm pleased with my decision to keep some
games books in my mobile library.  Captain video was the favorite of
the evening.</p>

<p>Bryn and David swing danced until they got too hot.  Chris and I
stood in the shade to watch.  Bryn liked going behind David because he
has glitter all over his back.</p>

<p>Went swimming and rode around on the yellow raft with Sean and
Abbey until it got ganked by Mikey.  Helped Phat Pat pick up big rocks
and skip them (and by skip them I mean not skip them).</p>

<p>Chatted with Abbey for a bit about school and plans and such.
Might say HI to her in Ohio when I'm up that way.</p>

<p>I got the opportunity to listen to Erin share about stuff in her
life.  The culmination of this event was her eating for the first time
in two days.</p>

<p>I missed the advisor meeting, and therefore haven't signed up for
rover duty.  Eeep.</p>

<p>Now I'm down by the lake but, again, there's only one advisor (me).</p>

<p class=date>8:31pm</p>

<p>Ah, Steve is here.  [splash splash splash splash]</p>

<p class=date>9:29pm</p>

<p>Cake: on the table, on the stereo, on Tanner, Bryn, Chris.</p>

<p>Tonight is the first night dance.  Lots of peeps chilling and
dancing and such.</p>

<p>Debbie hollering, "No!  Just let one song play all the way through!
I like that song.  leave it right there.  what is the problem???"</p>

<p class=date>11:03pm</p>

<p>Time for worship soon.  We have successfully had the first night's
check in at our touch groups.  Our group got to meet Hunter from
Houston, new to our group.</p>

<p>We'll probably have a Silent Football game after worship.  I'm not
sure though.</p>

<p class=date>11:28pm</p>

<p>David and I just figured out another way to play the psychic number
game.  We can get numbers up to 63, but we're sticking with 50 to make
our technique less obvious.  We also amazed Chez by communicating
"Penelope Cruz" and "Jimmy Fallon"  Nice.</p>

<p>Worship soon maybe.</p>

<p class=date>12:17am</p>

<p>I stood between Bryn and Wende at worship.  Good thing we were all
holding hands in the circle cause I was falling asleep, using them to
keep my balance while standing (and sleeping).</p>

<p>Bryn wore no sleeves, had a bit of trouble with mosquitoes.</p>

<p>Nice first night worship.  Very appropriate.</p>

<p class=date>1:05am</p>

<p>Calder is leading a Silent Football game.  I'm thrilled about that;
she is even showing new people how to play.  I hope the game goes
well.  I won't be there for I have set up my bed on the road by the
lake.</p>

<p class=date>2:28am</p>

<p>Bryn and Chris came down to sleep as well.</p>

<p>Awake now.  Leaving Dude's soon to go to Dallas then SWUUSI.  Will
get breakfast on the way out.</p>

<p class=date>7:27am</p>

<p>I'm at America's Service Center, across the street from my ex
apartment complex.  Fred poured oil into my car last night to top it
off and said something weird seemed to come out of the bottle and into
the engine.  He described it as a lump, but couldn't say better than
that what it might have been.  Probably not a marble, but maybe a
clump of dried oil?  So I'm getting my oil changed.</p>

<p>Just as I pulled into the station the <em>Check Engine</em> light
came on, so maybe something needs to be checked.  Very convenient
timing.</p>

<p>Dropped off Scott at the service station, got a Biscuit Boy (3
biscuits and sausage in white gravy) at 59 Diner.  The manager at
service station called, "oh you've got a big oil leak and we have to
wash the engine to figure out where it's from, and it's damaged the
rubber grommet on your control arm and all this stuff.</p>

<p>The oil leak I've known about, but had never heard it described as
"bad," nor had I heard it has been chewing on rubber under my car.
Pooh.</p>

<p>So they are cleaning the engine now and we'll see what's next.</p>

<p>I'm thankful to be chillin' inside in air conditioned air than
outside on the freeway with my car not driving.</p>

<p class=date>9:39am</p>

<p>They wanna replace my oil pan gasket and valve cover gasket and
control arm for a grand totaly of one meeelion dollars.  Okay, one
thousand dollars, but still several dollars.  I'm choosing to replace
the two gaskets and not the control arm right now.  3.5 hours
estimated time.  Sigh.</p>

<p>I'm sad that I didn't do this yesterday, but wait-a-second, the
only reason I'm here is that Fred poured a lump into my oil.  I didn't
think I needed to get it checked after I had gone to Oak Forest
Automotive so recently, but at that time they just looked at (and
fixed) the air conditioner and apparently didn't see or weren't too
concerned about this terrific oil leak.  Although a couple weeks
previously, they (Oak Forest) had changed the oil.  Hmmmm.</p>

<p>Well, I will go to Kinko's a play around on my website; see what
progress I can make on my new journal indexing.</p>

<p class=date>12:38pm</p>

<p>Scott is fixed.  I inquired about financing and have just received
1 year no interest to pay off the $560 or so, and, um, oh, and I was
granted a $2500 credit line so that means I can charge more to it
during my trek, but I bet I won't be able to continue no interest if I
do that.  I dunno.</p>

<p>Point is, car is fixed, no cash out of pocket right now.</p>

<p>Driving to Dallas now.</p>

<p class=date>2:19pm</p>

<p>Just got gas in Huntsville.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Got to Denton around 6:30 or something and Jackie + Leigh + Marta
helped unload my car and put most of my shit into Marta's house.  Hung
out a bit at Marta's resting and wrestling and then we drove to
SWUUSI!</p>

<p>Kelly, do you have anything to say for the journal?  "No, not
really, but SWUUSI better kick ass, and if it doesn't then I'll make
it cause it's my last SWUUSI.  And stuff.  I'm so close to sleep.
Like so I can stay awake tomorrow night.  But I don't have a pillow.
But I need sleep.</p>

<p>"Am I still talking like a decent human being?  Cause I'm not
making any sense to myself.  One thing you should never do before

<p>Now I'm back home.  Fred is taking four (4) boxes to Maggie's work,
plus the glass bottle that no longer has change in it, but still has a
plastic eyeball stopper on top.  Great thanks to Fred for helping
today, and to Maggie for taking so much of my stuff.</p>

<p>And thanks to Dude for giving me some moolah for the Euros and
pounds I gave him after my trek to Europe and before his trek to
Europe, and for the UPS I gave him last night or so.  I still need to
FTP images from his computer to mine.  After that, one day, somewhere,
sometime, maybe, I'll finally get pics from Europe trip online.</p>

<p class=date>6:00pm</p>

<p>At around 5pm, I dropped off Spot's food dish and water, which I
had forgotten the first time, then zipped over the Dude's to FTP the
images from his computer to my computer.  It didn't work immediately
so I left and zipped back to the apartment office and got the good
news:</p>

<p>The new guy's application is approved; he will move in on
Sunday.</p>

<p>I put my initial on the lease in various places where my name was
crossed out in preparation for the new guy's name.  I didn't get a
copy of the document, but Jill said that since their copy had my name
crossed off and initialed, that I was pretty well safe.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Past that, it took way longer than I thought to get all my stuff
into my car.  I'm super thankful for Fred's help, and impressed with
how much he got in his car.</p>

<p>Packed the car, used the carpet sweeper on my hands and knees
because the handle to the sweeper was buried in Fred's car, closed the
door for good, went down to Andrea's to give her the Sark poster "How
To Relax About Money" and George decided he wanted the recliner, so we
went back up and got the recliner and then closed the door for good
again.</p>

<p>It was 10:30pm before I was ready to go, and Wende didn't have to
encourage me too much to not drive to Dallas tonight.</p>

<p class=date>12:52am</p>

<p>Tired now.  I'm at Dude's and have been trying to find a good free
image manipulator for OS X.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>

<p>Heehee; I'm sleeping in Gene's old room.  :-)</p>

<p>I feel really really really really really really sad.</p>

<p>I carried all of Spot's stuff down to the car - food, litterbox,
scoop, treats, catnip..  then came back up for Spot and found him
lounged on the floor.. I just started to bawl.  So sad to give Spot
away.  All these tears pouring up my face with my head buried on the
carpet.</p>

<p>Spot was all, "what the hell is all that noise?" and climbed up to
the windowsill to lounge some more.</p>

<p>Super thanks to Jennifer for taking him on a moment's notice.  She
was going to take him, but didn't know that she was going to take him
<em>today</em>.  I called her about 30 minutes ahead of time.  She
gracefully said no problem; he'll just sleep over at Paint This!
tonight, since she's not going home after work.</p>

<p>I wonder if he'll become a Paint This! cat.  That would be pretty
cool.</p>

<p class=date>7:20pm CDT Thursday 18 July 2002</p></p>

<p>At GenXchange meeting now, and Jose' is the new president, which is
good since I'm mentally missing already.  Wende is doing treasurer
stuff, organizing it to move on to the next person.  Oh, I know what I
can do is give my president binder to Jose'.</p>

<p class=date>8:31pm</p>

<p>The presidential 1/2 of the meeting went well; we brainstormed
goals for the upcoming year. Didn't do it on butcher paper, so someone
(Sandra) will have to consolidate similar goals and present the
summary to the club.</p>

<p>As I left, no one really seemed to notice except Gerald and my
brother.  The rest were all crowded around Wende who was giving a
treasurer lesson to the club.  I'm thankful that she is able to do
that.  The treasurer positions is way more difficult than the
presidential one, I think.</p>

<p>Now I'm outside of Bombay Palace, waiting for Catherine who is
treating me to dinner here as a going away present.  :-) to Catherine
for this.  Kristen was also invited (2 hours before now) so she may
also come.</p>

<p>I was up until 5am last night working on my website, not working on
moving.  Time to pack.  Panic Pack.  :-)</p>

<p class=date>8:36pm</p>

<p>At around 4:30pm Wende helped me pack my clothes for SWUUSI and my
trek.  Super duper special thanks to her for that.</p>

<p>At Bombay Palace with Catherine.  Funniest thing was when the train
went by and I was all, "is it going this direction?" and indicated
with my thumb, and she nodded yes, then goes, "no," and starts moving
her eyes as if watching it go by the other direction.  Funny!</p>

<p>To Catherine's house so I could read a bit from her Culture Shock
India book.  Then big hug and I'll miss you's.</p>

<p class=date>12:32am</p>

<p>Fred and I arrived at Kinko's and Swa'vet was here with Greg.  As
they were leaving Swa'vet was all, "Rob. Call me tomorrow."</p>

<p>"I'm leaving tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Then call me in the morning before you leave."</p>

<p>"What's your number?"</p>

<p>As Swa'vet was getting her card out of her purse, Junie and Greg
were both talking, actually all three of them were, and she gave me
her card in a multi-tasking type way, then as she left says to me,
"Rob, stop fucking around and call me tomorrow."</p>

<p>Fred and I laughed for several minutes at that.</p>

<!-- p>They're at 3440 Belfort tomorrow.</p -->
