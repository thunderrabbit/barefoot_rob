<p class=date>7:54pm CDT Sunday 10 June 2001</p></p>

<p>I have basically just arrived home from the rally.  I drove across
three of the four bridges across 59, which had been almost under
water.  The ground floor of our building was (was = had been) flooded.
Scott, who was parked at the rental place, had water six inches up the
tires.</p>

<p>I'm going to ride my bike around downtown and see what I can see.
Doh!  I don't have a camera!</p>

<p class=date>10:08pm</p>

<p>In no particular order:</p>

<p>In the great flood of 2001, water got 6 feet deeper than <a
href="/journal/1998/images/flood/wet.jpg">this</a> in September
1998.</p>

<p>According to the Fox 26 reporter, 105 buildings in downtown were
flooded, and couldn't turn their lights on because their generators
were still flooded.  Maybe a week before they can turn their
electricity on again.</p>

<p>UH Downtown lost all three of their patrol cars.  They went to
rescue a woman who was trapped in her car; they had to break her car
windows to get her out.  When they got her out, their cars were
floating away, lights still flashing as they sank.</p>

<p>In a surprising cascading waterfall, Water poured from the bowels
of the Alley Theater down the steps toward buffalo bayou.  They had a
big big tube gushing water out.  A <em>lot</em> of buildings had big
tube gushing water out.</p>

<p>Water got to exactly 3 bricks below the sidewalk level of Alley
Theater where they have the curved water cascading down by some
different steps near Bayou Place.</p>

<p><em>Entirely</em> spooky to ride around downtown and have the
street lights on, but all the building lights off.  Equal numbers of
traffic lights were 1) working properly, 2) blinking red, 3) dark.</p>

<p>Channel 13 news van could not have its signal received by Channel
13 studios.</p>

<p>I am so tired I'm falling asleep as I try to think of more things
that I saw.</p>

<p>I feel exceptiionally blessed that I have been allowed to sleep
through cleanup.  I wonder if it's unfair to the community, or
ultiately in the greater good because they can all sleep on the way
home, and I will likely have to drive.  (Please note: I did clear with
Susie and Denise that they would drive home first, and I would sleep
the first few hours, giving me a total of about 6 hours of sleep
before driving the remaining 4 hours home.)</p>  

<p>Allison is climbing out of a tree.  There is yelling outside.
Announcing closing circle.  I'm going to pack my stuff and go.</p>

<p class=date>8:39 am</p>

<p>I was just asked by Scottie et. al. to do Aristasha (long version).
We had plenty of time so I didn't have to do Aristasha (short
version).  I wonder if we can make up a workable Aristasha (extended
remix), or maybe Aristasha (dance mix) haha okay, I'm taking this too
far.</p>

<p>But the reason I'm writing is that Katy R is funny.  Advertising
SWUUSI:</p>

<p>Elizabeth:  "What is SWUUSI??"</p>

<p>Katy: "It's week! It's a rally!  It's a week long rally!"</p>

<p>Heheeheee that was funny.</p>

<p>You have given me a treasure.  I love you so.</p>

<p class=date>10:57 am</p>

<p>We ate at IHOP; I left a pretty big tip because we pretty much
inundated the waitstaff, and our waitress was cute cute.</p>

<p>Hugs and hugs and hugs and hugs many times over, several tears from
some youth and hopefully supportive words from me.</p>

<p class=date>1:43 pm</p>

<p>During the trip so far, Gram and Brian have been talking only about
computer security.  I pretty much haven't been able to follow any of
their conversation, even if I had been fully awake.</p>

<p>We just stopped for munchies and wizzies.  I got ice cream and
cookies. Ryan flirted with the Subway Sandwiches Girl.  Pat got
fluorescent green sour squirt candy.  Hethre got attacked by a fly on
her (Hethre's) way to get ice cream. Cassie and Hethre complained
about computer science class (an indirect tangent conversation of Gram
and Brian's) in which they are learning C++ as their first language!
Allison said she had already waited the 30 minutes. Betsy chose
between chocolate and pistachios. Tanner got his snack for
$1.86. Christina slept in the car.  Other people did other things. We
all marveled to hear that Houston had received thirty five inches of
rain.</p>

<p class=date>1:58 pm</p>

<p>We just drove by an auto dealership with four cars out front, each
with their hood up, and three of which each had a large letter.  They
apparently are selling ALE.  Nice.</p>

<p class=date>6pm</p>

<p>Back at First Church.  So amazing to see the water lines where
water lines shouldn't be.  After we clean out the van, I am going to
go ride my bike around and see what I can see.</p>

<p>We arrived around 4am and I was happy to remember
*most* of the names of youth who came to say HI and
get a Rob Hug.  :-)!!</p>

<p>Been awake talking to:</p>

<p><ul><li> Becky T, the adult in charge of the rally</li>
<li>Laura Douglas with
<ol>
<li>Ryan M about the board repressing youth worship.</li>
<li>Nick G about the YAC not controlling youth enough.</li>
</ol>
</ul></p>

<p>Now I'm outside tossing the disc with Tanner and Mattboy.</p>

<p class=date>10:01 am</p>

<p>Houston is pretty flooded, Wende's friend Julie had two feet of
water in her house.  ouch!!!</p>

<p>Our house is okay.  Did I just write that?  Wende is
going to Julie's house to help her clean.</p>

<p>Wende got home from work at midnight last night.</p>

<p>It's as flooded as it was when I took pictures with
Eric..  Cars were abandoned on Westeimer and Shepered,
and it's entirely wack.  I would really like to be
there to take pictures!!!!!!</p>

<p>Wende says HI.</p>

<p>I'm going to sleep now.  I've slept 4 hours so far
since Friday morning.</p>

<p>Awake now.</p>

<p>My neck and back are so tight; I'm going to call Kathy Fey, my
massage therapist to make an appointment.</p>

<p>It's a ghosttown outside. (?)</p>

<p>Fuck!  they must all be at the Social Action thing;
I didn't intend to miss that, but I had to sleep. 
Dammit.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Report from Kathy Fey in Houston:  West Gray was
under water.  That's *fucking* high ass water.  If
West Gray was under water, a ton of other streets were
under water.  I've never previously seen or heard of
water that deep in Houston.</p>

<p>18 wheelers were floating on I-10 at TC Jester</p>

<p>Cars were parked on the sidewalk at Starbucks to
get out of the water on the street.</p>

<p>I-45 was closed last night at Conroe.  (I told her, <em>'we
know'</em> and briefed our story)</p>

<p>The radar shows more water to come.</p>

<p>That's all I can remember that she said.</p>

<p class=date>3:57 pm</p>

<p>We are fully back from the social action; I'm so thankful that
someone knew where they went, and that Tori's mom knew how to get
there!  She drove and I worked about an hour. I helped Grantly and
Emma move a pile of rocks and then helped throw away the
backstop.</p>

<p>This backstop has had a history with us: Two years ago we moved it
from outside the track to inside the track.  Last year we moved the
other backstop, but it fell to pieces and got thrown away.  This year
we cut to pieces and threw away the original backstop.</p>

<p>My feet feel a bit worn.  The asphalt was a bit hot.  We took
pictures of the group by the sign out front of the building.  As we
drove by the sign later, we saw that it said "UNITARIAN YOUTH ARE
UPER!"  It was an electronic marquee, so it hadn't been vandalized.
It just wasn't working correctly.</p>

<p class=date>4:02 pm</p>

<p>Funny exchange between Debu and Amber:</p>

<p>"MMMOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!   Please
PUHLEASE  PlEASE MOMMY puhlease please"</p>

<p>"Rob, she wants her clothes out of the car.  tell
her, she's fifteen"</p>

<p>"You're fifteen, you can't wear clothes.  What?  What does her
being fifteen have to do with wearing clothes?"</p>

<p>"Mommmyy please!!!"</p>

<p>"She wants me to go get them."</p>

<p>"Oh!!!!  Amber!!!!  You can get your own clothes
out of the car; you're fifteen!"</p>

<p>Amber took the keys, "fine I'll go get them."</p>

<p>Just as Amber was leaving, Debbie yelled, "Amber Jo!"</p>

<p>"Deborah .. Dawn!"</p>

<p>"While you're there will you get me.."</p>

<p>"No!" and she strutted out the door.</p>

<p>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHHAHAHAHAAH!</p>

<p class=date>4:11 pm</p>

<p>Now I'm chilling with Scottie H, who is DJing with
a spread of CDs all over the table.</p>

<p class=date>8:32 pm Saturday</p>

<p>Phat Pat and I have just written a great skit for
the talent show.</p>

<p>Holy  fuckin shit.  Susie just said that the water
is up to the  bridges over Highway 59.  I Want to see
it!!!  WOW!!  Those bridges are like 15 feet high and
I have *never* seen any more than a few inch puddle on
the freeway below them.</p>

<p>Elizabeth and I are about to call Wende.</p>

<p class=date>11:33 pm</p>

<p>Booty dance music and Dane bursts onto the scene wearing a sleek
sleek black vinyl shiny outfit and does this crazy Dane Dance that is
not the normal bouncing around, but it includes dancing standing on
his hands.  His name is now "Richter" and he has a german accent it
seems..</p>

<p>Laura is great.</p>

<p>there is a rip in the ass of his vinyl pants (it's
polyuerythane (sp)) held together only by duct tape</p>

<p class=date>12:04 am Sunday 10 June 2001</p>

<p>Frank just showed Laura and me FruityLoops, a phat
beat editor (beat = the bassline for techno songs)
that is even cooler than my keyboard.</p>

<p>Grantly has just performed in drag to a screaming
crowd in the dining hall.  Wow.</p>

<p>Lisa O (advisor) is reading tarot cards for Natalie B.</p>

<p class=date>12:23 am</p>

<p>Worship now, and I am intrigued to see that Christina is sitting by
Elizbeth.  Unrequited Love is the worship activity now.</p>

<p class=date>2:32 am</p>

<p>Just got to see Susanne K and Melissa C, who came to say HI and
perform Rocky Raccoon in Steve F's absence.  So great to see them, and
how great to hear that Susanne is a pilot now!  She can fly Cessnas.
Nice.  Only $75/hour to rent one and she can fly it for us!!  How
funny/awesome to hear that Melissa has set up an alias to her long
email address at school by setting up a distribution list with only
her name in the list.  :-)</p>

<p>Dane is playing quite an intriguing single string bowed instrument
thing with a stick attached to a shaker.  Quite cool.  Quite odd.
Quite Dane.</p>

<p>I am predicting this will be the last talent and then we'll play
Silent Football.</p>

<p>Hello,  this is Ben, your typer for this evening. We
will be hearing quotes from two games of Silent Football tonight.</p>

<p class=date>Game #1, in no particular order.</p>

<p>Mr. Kisses - Uses bad country lawyer accent, twice, if
forced to come up with a different accent each time he
talkes.</p>

<p>First Accent: Bad hindu accent, says 'like a cobra
trying to pass kidney stones through his galbladder',
Mrs. Elizabeth notices the error and he is given
penance.</p>

<p>Second Accent: Bad Hitler, is accused of being racist,
is awarded penance points.</p>

<p>Third Accent: British Lord, is accused to be slipping
in and out of Australian accent, is sold  a
non-penance point if he doesn't use either accent
again.</p>

<p>Miss Inclined - 'I think Mrs. one space to my left is
dead.'</p>

<p>Mr. Dictator - 'Mrs. Emma is awarded one half of one
penance point for breaking the fifth rally rule: no
dying.'</p>

<p class=date>Game #2</p>

<p>(the game's attempt to start)
<br>Nick's reaction to penance points for being from AR
'Gosh Darnit'</p>

<p>Katie is Mistress scratch and sniff</p>

<p>Senor Donut  en   mi  pantalones (mike h. )</p>

<p>(Lauuren I.)  Miss  thanksgivings-with-meagyn-cusack
Ryan is a dumbass</p>

<p>'oh god, rob, I've heard the voice of  your shirt!' 
whoo else  but Ryan (Rob burped)</p>

<p>parody 
of silent football by  distractions  of the  universe
named Dan and Ben ('tip  of the ass')</p>

<p>foreign perpetrators turn on each other</p>

<p>We  start the game,  Ryan metaphors  the football with
his penis, talks  bullshit again</p>

<p>customary 'cyberskin'</p>

<p>Miss Jane Bond not only fwapped a fwap  fwap but
reversed the direction of the football at the same
time and received penance points on request (also
spoke out of turn but no one called  it)</p>

<p>2.7 min into the game, Stevie kills us (hookah smoking
caterpillar) by shroduming a shrug</p>

<p>customary 'I didn't see anything'</p>

<p>Nick zoomed a zoom zoom, has spaz attack.  Commandante
Googliemonster cottagefries. 'My heart. My heart is
sad' 'pee-shiveriing pronoun. U get the pee shivers?!'
<br>(Who else? Ryan!)</p>

<p>---------</p>

<p>Lauren O typing Silent football</p>

<p class=date>June 10, 2001, 5:25a</p>

<p>Ryan 
compares silent universe to weird foriegn film
involving mime selling wife</p>

<p>there is a giant spitwad on the  ceiling that  Nick 
is  pointing out to Ryan.</p>

<p>loud bodily noises and Nick zoomed a zoom zoom .</p>

<p>Rob says 'Mrs. Thanksgiving With Meg Cusack gets ::blah  blah:: points for 
belching  so unfeminininnilly.  (Note: Mrs. TWMC's

<p class=note>(dream)</p></p>

<p>I remember two distinct dreams, but I've been awake for a while
now, and don't remember details.  Both of them were about preparing
for OKC:</p>

<p class=dream>At the van rental place, I was talking to the guy who
said that two groups were renting an identical model van, and he had
no way to tell them apart.  "We can put a big dent in one, Just
Kidding!!" I said.  He was only slightly amused.  I suggested that he
look at the license plates, which should be different.  Ah.</p>

<p>Other dream:</p>

<p class=dream>Driving to OKC I realized I had forgotten to wear my
OKC shirt from last year, but I didn't suggest that we go back and get
it.</p>

<p>I was relieved to learn it was a dream!</p>

<p>Rain.  rain.  rain.  rain.   We left The Woodlands
at 6:00pm.  We have traveled 8.3 miles.  Eight point
three.  No end in sight of this line of cars.</p>

<p class=date>7:29 pm</p>

<p>8.4 miles.</p>

<p>"If you guys want to get out and stretch your
legs, feel free."</p>

<p>hahahahahaha!!</p>

<p class=date>7:36 pm</p>

<p>The youth are discussing some classic Long Jokes.. 
the <em>Fuck You Clown</em> joke, and <em>The Man In The Black Hat,
White Gloves, And Red Cape That Killed My Mom, My Dad,
My Seven Brothers And Seven Sisters</em></p>

<p class=date>7:37 pm</p>

<p>We have just made 8.5 miles.</p>

<p>I'm going to think of another good Long Joke to add
to my repertoire</p>

<p class=date>7:47 pm</p>

<p>I announced, "Okay, now we'e gone nine miles."</p>

<p>"Finally!" and "Yay!" came the collective cheer from back.</p>

<p>"Just kiddin'!  We're still at 8.5!!!!"</p>

<p>AHHAhahahahahaaha!!!!!</p>

<p>They didn't think it was quite as funny.  Really, I don't either.</p>

<p>I just turned the van off.</p>

<p class=date>7:54 pm</p>

<p>Van is still off.  I just called 713-CALL-MAP 
(Motorist Assistance Plan) and they said there are
reports of water flooded across the freeway, so
Montgomery County Sherrifs have closed the shit off. 
It's still raining heavily; we may not be going across
anytime soon.  Bluh.</p>

<p class=date>8:00 pm</p>

<p>I just called Annie, and we moved forward about 40
feet while I was talking  to her for a moment.  Still
at 8.5 miles on the odometer.</p>

<p>Van off again.</p>

<p class=date>8:04 pm</p>

<p>We just moved again and there is a truck driving
backwards on the shoulder with his hazards on. 
Oh, it's an unoffficial truck.</p>

<p class=date>8:06 pm</p>

<p>8.6 miles baby!!!!</p>

<p class=date>8:14 pm</p>

<p>Smom writes:</p>

<p>According to an eyewitness over the radio, water is rushing over the
freeway and and a guy is talking on his cell phone over the radio
now from the area.</p>

<p>he said there is 4 or 5 feet of wter  (over the 
road??)  up to windows in water on  some cars.</p>

<p class=date>8:16 pm</p>

<p>8.7 miles already.</p>

<p class=date>8:26 pm</p>

<p>8.8 miles.  Reports of road closures  all over
Houston.  I wonder how it will all pan out for us.</p>

<p class=date>8:29 pm</p>

<p>There is a parade of cars suddenly coming
southbound on I 45; I  don't  know where they are
coming from.  I wonder if the road is opened somehow
or what.  Maybe it's traffic U turned around..</p>

<p class=date>8:36 pm</p>

<p>One of te KTRH traffic reporters got stuck in  a
ditch.  Shelters are being opened around the  city.

<p class=date>8:39 pm</p>

<p>8.8 miles ....  I feel sad.  I am optimistic yet that we will be
able to reach OKC at least by tomorrow.  I predict the youth will want
to persevere, and get to the rally.  It will make a good story.</p>

<p class=date>8:53 pm</p>

<p>8.8 miles! and we are suddenly moving 100 yards. at 5 mph What is
happening???????</p>

<p>8.9 now wow we are flying at 2 mph.  two.</p>

<p class=date>8:57 pm</p>

<p>9.0 miles!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>how is it that we are moving????</p>

<p class=date>8:58 pm</p>

<p class=note>Susie again:</p>

<p>we  went 9 mph for a minute but not  much  more  than  that</p>

<p class=date>9:00 pm</p>

<p>Rock just got to the radio station (KTRH) and he is usually on in the morning so he said 'Good morniing' accidentally.  silly  man, old habits die hard.</p>

<p class=date>9:02 pm</p>

<p>moving again, but not much... 9.1  miles now</p>

<p class=date>9:03 pm</p>

<p>Christina singing Cabaret...Katy singing softly to 
something  playing  on  her personal CD  player</p>

<p>getting off I45 trying something different....getting on 75, going
through Conroe..Kids now singing 'Raindrops Keep Falliing...'  Ahh,
we're moviing, 35 mph</p>

<p class=date>9:22 pm</p>

<p>Rob again..  We  have bailed to highway 75  and are
at 12.4 miles.  stopped for gas.</p>

<p class=date>9:58 pm</p>

<p>Spirits are up; looks like we hae gotten past,
using 75.  I will call Annie only once we reach I-45
again</p>

<p class=date>10:25 pm</p>

<p>road is clear and damp. no rain. 65 mph. 45.7 miles traveled.</p>

<p class=date>12:54 am Saturday 9 June 2001</p>

<p>Susie has been driving and I've been sleeping. 
Had a scary jerk awake from a dream when I thought I
had fallen asleep while I was driving and I grabbed
for the steering wheel,  but it wasn't there and I
realized I was supposed to be sleepping.  quite a
relief that was.</p>

<p>We are at 224.0 miles traveled.</p>

<p>The music on the CD  player is a welcome relief
from the 'usual' stuff, which is 'usually'  stuff
that I've heard before a million times.  Truth  is,
though, that this muusic  is some that I  don't care
for in general, but it's nice to be uniqe at least.  I
would still rate it as good enough to play on KTRU. 
But  I'm  guessing it's  a bit  too  popular for us
to play.  I don't  know  though.</p>

<p class=date>2:07 am</p>

<p>We are well on our way after the most recent gas station stop,
where we have discovered that it appears we left our gas money
envelope at the previous gas station.  I just suddenly got the
brain-flash-thought that we donated the money to a charitable cause
.. maybe someone whose car flooded out and broke got the money.  Or
maybe Susie's husband Kevin will be able to recover it in the
morning.</p>

<p class=date>2:11 am</p>

<p>About 150 miles to OKC.</p>

<p>We are listening to Jets To Brazil on CD.</p>

<p class=date>2:16 am</p>

<p>Oh - only 126 miles to OKC; we are 2 miles inside
the OK border.</p>

<p>Fred, as you know, is smart.</p>

<p>I haven't taken the time to really look at all the
stuff he sent me, but the bottom line is he wrote a
shopping cart in perl.  That rules.  That's awesome. 
I'm highly impressed.</p>

<p>At about 2pm I decided to find a map to the OKC
church.  The past two years I have missed the exit and
got all lost in the one way streets of the northside
of OKC.</p>

<p>This year I pasted together a map, using the
wonders of <a
href="https://www.mapquest.com">mapquest</a> including
aerial photos of the exit and of the church. (Don't
freak quite yet; the aerial shot of the church is
barely recognizable as the church; I can't see any
license plates.</p>

<p>Walked to Kinko's and asked if they could laminate
it.  Hung out looking at greeting cards for about 3
minutes and they said it was ready.</p>

<p>"It got a little wrinkled, though," she said.</p>

<p>Before I could say, "that's okay,"</p>

<p>"so we can give it to you free."</p>

<p>"Ummm.. okay.  Thanks very much!"</p>

<p>Wheee!!!  A free laminated map to OKC Rally!</p>

2001</p></p>

<p>I'm awake because it's raining heavily again, and the pattering
against the windows, plus the lightning and thunder woke me up.  The
water in street is almost puddled all the way across the street.  I'm
too tired to think of the right phraseology.  Basically if the water
in the gutter gets about an inch deeper, it will cover the entire
street.</p>

<p>My lovely <a href="https://www.apcc.com">APC</a> UPS keeps clicking
as it provides my computer with a pure clean electrical current even
though the lightning strikes close by.</p>

<p>While I rode my bike to work on Tuesday, I hit the handle on a
trash can as I squeezed between the trash can and a much more solid
tree.  Actually my left bicep hit the trash can and it (my bicep) is
still bruised.  Actually it feels like the bone is bruised.  The
"femur" of my arm.  Radius, ulna, femur, tibia, fibula, but I can't
remember the name of the forearm bone.</p>

<p>Humerus!</p>
