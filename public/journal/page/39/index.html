<p>Last night we discussed presenting a day-long workshop to men in Tokyo.  My vision is to expand the work to new men around Tokyo and eventually Japan.  I am looking for 2 or 3 men to help me present the workshop in October or November this year.  I hope to meet with whoever steps up and create a plan by early August.</p>

<p>Today Tomoko seemed quite entertained with the magnitude of Marble
Track 3&rsquo;s Construction.  It worked well to show her
<a href="https://mt2.robnugen.com/">Marble Track 2</a> because she soon asked how
I made it.</p>

<p>Nowadays at JB, I teach 5 lessons on Wednesdays, 20% more than the
past year of lessons.</p>

<p>I think I finished adding ARC Cycles to CSV reports for AB.  I mean I
finished, and I think they are what AB wanted.</p>

<p>I think my passport expires soon; I gotta get that sorted.  Because no
one checks my passport unless I leave the country, I figured I can let
it be expired for a while, but now I realize that may not be a good
idea.</p>

<p>Our 6pm students seem to be late.  It&rsquo;s after 5:59 now.  Not late!  16
seconds to spare.</p>

<p class="dream">While on campus at a university I needed to use the
restroom to go number 2, but all the restrooms had lines.  From
experience, I knew that the restrooms on higher floors had shorter
lines, but I had to go up to a floor I had never previously seen.</p>

<p class="dream">I got to some kind  of room with a lectern and chairs
and wanted to  see what was on  the next floor, but it  was locked.  I
could see under the door tht  someone was there, but it was apparently
a private floor.  I went around a corner and found a pair of restrooms
that were adjacent with no wall between them, and realized there was a
mirror between them so they each looked like larger rooms.</p>

<p class="dream">I chose the one with had a symbol for men on the
door, and just my luck, there was a giant turd floating in the water.
I flushed the ancient handle, but the water just went higher and the
turd was that much closer to overflow.  I tried again with more vigor
and noticed the water did go down, but only after holding the handle
down for a while.  So I held the handle and got the water down to a
manageble level and sat down to do my business.</p>

<p class="dream">The door to the next restroom opened, and lo, it was
not a mirror, but a simple shower curtain between the loos.  The woman
who came in was like, actually this toilet is for number 2 and that
one is for number 1 only.  I nodded my head politely, and she asked if
I knew what she meant.</p>

<p class="dream">"Yes, this is for number 1," holding up 1 finger,
"and that is for number 2," holding up 2 fingers as if that proved
anything.  After a moment, I explained that I used the restroom which
had the symbol for men on it.</p>

<p class="dream">She was like, "yeah that means number 1 only."</p>

<p class="dream">I said "hmm yeah well that makes sense" and I thought
about it for a while and realized "oh, but I know how to control this
toilet now. You guys designated this for pee only because sometimes
the water only rises. Not to mention, there was a giant turd in this
toilet when I came in, and I cleaned it up, so you are welcome."</p>

<p class="dream">She perked up to hear that.  "Really?  Because that
would be great," and gave me a kiss.</p>

<p>Then I woke up.</p>

<p>To cs@r&hellip;.t.com<br>
SUBJECT: Unauthorized charges on my credit card</p>

<p>Hello</p>

<p>My name is Rob Nugen, and I am writing to ask you to remove unauthorized charges from my credit card.</p>

<p>My credit card number is (REDACTED)</p>

<p>On or around April 15, 2018, I used my credit card to do age verification for <a href="https://free-adult-games.com/">https://free-adult-games.com/</a>  The website URL and name both indicate the content is free.  I read the information written around the credit card entry form and felt assured my card would not be charged.  Otherwise, I would not have signed up because there is plenty of free pornography available online.</p>

<p>On or around May 28th 2018, I received my credit card statement which showed three different charges (even though I only entered my credit card number one time).</p>

<ol>
<li>April 17 wirescredcomp.com (866) 412-377 for $39.95</li>
<li>April 20 quotekrewbill.com (866) 324-828 for $39.94</li>
<li>April 24 payzonebill.com (877) 253-895 for $49.95</li>
</ol>

<p>I chatted with a friendly customer service agent who assured me all the charges would be removed from my credit card.  I was given a cancelation number el3168.</p>

<p>I have a copy of the transcript here:
<a href="https://new.robnugen.com/journal/2018/05/29/cancelled-porn-charges/">https://new.robnugen.com/journal/2018/05/29/cancelled-porn-charges/</a></p>

<p>This month, I have received the same set of three charges.</p>

<ol>
<li>May 16 wirescredcomp.com (866) 412-377 for $39.95</li>
<li>May 20 quotekrewbill.com (866) 324-828 for $39.94</li>
<li>May 24 payzonebill.com 866 401-9676 for $49.95</li>
</ol>

<p>I called customer service this time, and was assured they &ldquo;could only remove 2 charges&rdquo; which is insufficient given there were <em>more</em> than 2 charges <em>each month</em>, even though I had only entered my credit card number one time, on one site.</p>

<p>I ran out of credit while on the phone so was disconnected while on hold.  I went back to customer service chat.</p>

<p>I have a copy of the transcipt here:
<a href="https://new.robnugen.com/journal/2018/07/03/note-to-self-do-not-sign-up-for-porn/">https://new.robnugen.com/journal/2018/07/03/note-to-self-do-not-sign-up-for-porn/</a></p>

<p>The agent made the same assurances that all the charges have been removed.  I asked how I can trust they have been removed after I was given the same assurances last month.  The agent suggested I write to you.  Curiously, this agent gave me the same cancellation confirmation code.  el3168</p>

<p>The charges listed above were not authorized.
Please remove all the charges listed above and any other similar charges from my credit card number ________________.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br>
Rob Nugen</p>
