<p>Called Susiemom to wish her happy birthday after I saw her LJ
entry.  I'm a tad later for work than I intended; missed the previous
bus by a couple minutes; I trust this bus will get me to work on
time.</p>

<p>Yeeha; he's runnin' red lights.</p>

<p class=date>1:01pm</p>

<p>350 meters to Kawasaki station.  But there are lights.  I think
we'll make it.</p>

<p>(I made it)</p>

<p>At work Yukiji gave me 1/3 inch worth of photocopied sheets to
teach me Japanese.  Awesome!  She's the student who's been stuck in
level 5 for 2.5 years after zooming from 7C to 5 in 2.5 years.</p>

<p>She emailed me tonight and I just emailed her back.</p>

<p>Um, oh.  . .  Um, oh I called Gateway 21 and have an appointment
with Lucy in Shinjuku on Wednesday at 4pm.  I'll just yammer with them
a bit about possibly working for them maybe 1 day per week.  I have a
guess that won't be an option, but we will see.</p>

<p>I received an awesome package from my mom and an awesome letter
from janette!  Package = shampoo and M&Ms.  Mmmmm. M&Ms.  Letter =
black paper and multiple markers and many pages.  I haven't even
finished reading it yet!</p>

<p>###comments</p>

<p><p><b>Name:</b> Ma</p>

<p><p><b>Email:</b> ellisfile2@ <em>redacted</em></p>

<p><p><b>Comment:</b>
<br>Hi, Rob,<br>
<br>
Glad the package got to you okay. I was worried about the shampoo. We&rsquo;re not really supposed to mail liquid, either. There was no tube of shampoo &ldquo;goo&rdquo; to be found.<br>
<br>
I&rsquo;m reading a book of autobiographical essays by David Sedaris (<em>Me Talk Pretty One Day</em>). Here are some excerpts from his essay &ldquo;See You Again Yesterday.&rdquo; He met a guy who has a house in France and this is about some of the annual trips they took for an August vacation&hellip;.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Hugh had moved to New York after spending six years in France&hellip; . There was, he said, a house in Normandy.  This was most likely followed by a qualifier, something pivotal like &lsquo;but it&rsquo;s a dump.&rsquo; He probably described it in detail, but by that point I was only half listening.  Instead, I&rsquo;d begun to imagine my life in a foreign country, some faraway land where, if things went wrong, I could always blame somebody else, saying I&rsquo;d never wanted to live there in the first place.  Life might be difficult for a year or two, but I would tough it out because living in a foreign country is one of those things that everyone should try at least once.  My understanding was that it completed a person, sanding down the rough provincial edges and transforming you into a citizen of the world.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see this as a romantic idea.  It had nothing to do with France itself, with waring hats or writing tortured letters from a sidewalk cafe. I didn&rsquo;t care where Hemingway drank or Alice B. Toklas had her mustache trimmed. What I found appealing in life abroad was the inevitable sense of helplessness it would inspire.  Equally exciting would be the work involved in overcoming that helplessness. There would be a goal involved, and I like having goals&hellip; .<br>
<br>
&hellip; &ldquo;On my fifth trip to France I limited myself to the words and phrases that people actually use.  From the dog owners I learned &lsquo;Lie down,&rsquo; &lsquo;Shut up,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Who shit on this carpet?&rsquo; The couple across the road taught me to ask questions correctly, and the grocer taught me to count. Things began to come together, and I went from speaking like an evil baby to speaking like a hillbilly. &lsquo;Is thems the thoughts of cows?&rsquo; I&rsquo;d ask the butcher, pointing to the calves&rsquo; brains displayed in the front window. &lsquo;I want me some lamb chops with handles on &lsquo;em.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
By the end of our sixth trip to France, the house wasfinished and I&rsquo;d learned a total of 1,564 words. It was an odd sensation to hold my entire vocabulary in my hands, to look back through the stack and recall the afternoon I learned to effectively describe my hangovers&hellip; .<br>
<br>
&ldquo;When the cranes arrived to build a twelve-story hotel right outside our bedroom window, Hugh and I decided to leave New York for a year or two, just until our resentment died down a little. I&rsquo;l determined to learn as much French as possible, so we&rsquo;ll take an apartment in Paris, where there are posters and headlines and any number of words waiting to be captured and transcribed onto index cards, where a person can comfortably smoke while making a spectacular ass of himself, and where, when frustrated, I can lie, saying I never wanted to come here in the first place.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I thought you could relate to some of this. Hope you enjoyed it!<br>
<br>
Love,<br>
<br>
Ma&ndash;I&rsquo;ll write more in a moment&hellip;..</p>

<p>On the train with Aki right about now - going to Cinecitta Kawaski
to seeeee Pirates of the Carribean.  Nice.</p>

<p>Aki is totally happier on the train than in the station cause
outside it's soo atsui to her.  Hot hot hot hot hot.</p>

<p>She's so funny.</p>

<p class=date>4:27pm JST Wednesday 6 August 2003</p>

<p>Good movie.  I wonder if upon a second viewing some more details
would become apparent.  It reminded me of _Princess Bride_ in the
tone, humor, action, and period.</p>

<p>I bid adeiu to Aki in Kawasaki station.  She prefers taking the
bus, yet she had already bought her ticket to ride the train home with
me before I remembered, and I didn't see her on the platform after I
said bye, so I wonder if she did in fact use the train to get home.
Mystery.</p>

<p>So instead of going home, I'm in Akihabara at the Macintosh
computer place to get two things hopefully: 1) the hinge fixed, and 2)
more memory.  MMMmmmmmmmm, memory.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>After this I'm rolling over to Shibuya to see if T3 is playing in
Shibuya on this coming Sunday evening, and if so, when I can buy
tickets.</p>

<p>Went to Subway to get a sandwich before meeting Aki.  Sat outside
under a tree and felt a huge raindrop on my shorts' pant leg.</p>

<p>Hmmm.  A big, warm raindrop.</p>

<p>Looked down.  Not a raindrop.  Bird poop. D'oh!  I wiped it off as
much as possible, and rinsed off in the restroom.  Ah well.</p>

<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol type="I">
<li><p>I'm feeling happier in Japan.  I've got some Japanese friends
who are girls, some of whom I met via Nova, which is a Nova No
No.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm working at Nova, and don't particularly like it, but it's
more bearable.  I will never love this company.  I may take my
vacation and run.  I may find some more private students and try to
forge my way forward that way.  That would mean getting new housing,
but we're getting screwed on housing.  I'm paying 72,000 yen, which
some peeps say is flat too much for my area.</p></li>

<li><p>Friends in Japan: Nami, Satoko, Jen, Olivia, Cory +
Janis, Carla, Mika.</p></li>

<li><p>Janette is coming to visit soon!  We're gonna have a ton of fun
and rock around the Kyoto, Osaka, and Nara area.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm so thankful for the support and love and goodies and
coversations from/to/with janette.</p></li>

<li><p>Need to call Yasuko to see if she was able to figure out prices
and such for trains to Kyoto et. al.</p></li>

<li><p>Ooooo if my computer costs more than 20,000 yen to update, I
can use my credit card on which I have a credit balance.  :-) I just
got the credit card in the mail after I lost the previous one with my
wallet back in April or May.</p></li>

<li><p>Oh, the updates to my computer include fixing the hinge that
broke during my dramatic exit from the train yesterday and upgrading
the memory.</p></li>

<li><p>Akisan is working again at the donut shop starting after
tomorrow.  So we're not going to have any more lessons together (after
tomorrow).  I wonder if I'll try to fill that space with another
student from findateacher.net.  I'll let it go for a while and see how
I feel.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm getting better at the language, sometimes the right words
want to come out.  Most times random Japanese phrases want to come
out.  The translation circus in my mind produces Japanese more readily
than Spanish.</p></li>

<li><p>I can see a solution to the navigation on my site; soon the
content will change somewhat dramatically, and the navigation will be
relatively consistent through all the content.  No more access to the
images through the clumsy interface.  No more (linked) access to the
images at all.  Might even produce a site map.  Might might spend some
time getting the search function to work.</p></li>

<li><p>I've begun to settle into not just my rut-routine, but kinda
sorta a tiny bit into the culture.  The western side of the culture
like watching movies.  And having friends.</p></li>

<li><p>Don't know how long I'll remain in Japan nor even what I'll do
after chillin' with janette in October.  My plan is like a big foggy
mystery to me after that.</p></li>

<li><p>Plan?  Anchor myself?  Release myself into buffeting winds of
life?  Who knows.</p></li>

<li><p>The shadow knows.</p></li>

<li><p>Japan: What a rush getting onto the Commuter Express train on
the Tokyu line at 7pm in Shibuya.  Pokerface Japanese all crashing
wordlessly into the train to get a seat.  I got one.  Woman beside me
nearly landed on me trying to sit next to me.  Fun stuff.</p></li>

<p>Pooh.  Quick Garage said they cannot fix my computer hinge *nor*
sell me any memory.  They gave me the Apple number so I called them
and they want me to *send them my computer* to have it fixed.  And it
could cost more than 10,000 yen (depending on what they have to
replace.  Fuck that.  I'll let it go for a while.  Shit they wanted my
password and everything.  If I give it to them, I'll change the
password to either something easy or something really fucked up and
claim that's my normal password.</p>

<p>Nice.</p>

<p>Got more memory for my machine.  512Megs instead of 256M.  I can't
really tell that it's faster, but I've gotten glimpses of fasterness.
The glimpses are explainable by my expectation that it's faster, not
necessarily by actual fact.</p>

<p>7326 yen.</p>

<p>Good lesson with Fumi.  About half and half Japanese vs English,
but I still got paid.  I paid for her meal (dessert) for being late
and for the nihongo learnin'</p>

<p>Explained the difference between girlfriends and friends who are
girls.</p>

<p>Great fun talking to Nami tonight; we are going to meet on Sunday
and possibly go see a movie and then we're going to Fujiku Highland on
the 12th!!  So exciting!!!</p>

<p>Talked to her for like an hour it seemed, and I kept wondering if
she was bored or needed to go.  I explained how it was really
important to me to maintain honesty in our friendship.  Don't be a
typical Japanese girl and not be able to say No if she needs to say
no.</p>
