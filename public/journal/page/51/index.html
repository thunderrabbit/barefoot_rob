<p>SOGO is 2 years old today, so the organizers suggested a picnic in
Yoyogi after the workout.  Great workout and picnic with maybe 100
peeps and 80 peeps in attendance, respectively.  I chatted with Hide,
who has come for quite a while, and some first timers, Kino, Anna, and
Laurie.  Actually I don&rsquo;t know if it was Kino&rsquo;s first time, but it was
my first time to meet her.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;m typing now, I think I might have sprained my thumb.  While
walking earlier, I could definitely feel a strain in my ankle.  Good
times.</p>

<p>oops it is tomorrow already, but today Lin and I had neighbors Richard
and Mai over for lunch, and then went for a walk with them and Fitz.
We found a geocache.</p>

<p><a href="https://coord.info/GLVJHGHK">https://coord.info/GLVJHGHK</a></p>

<p><a href="//b.robnugen.com/journal/2018/2018_april_second_geocache.jpg"><img src="//b.robnugen.com/journal/2018/thumbs/2018_april_second_geocache.jpg" alt="2018 april second geocache" /></a></p>

<p>I got a sharp flake of plastic splintered into my foot on the way
home.  Thankfully Lin was able to get it out relatively easily.</p>

<p>Today was the last day for
<a href="https://www.yourspeakingjourney.com/">Build Your Speaker Bio</a> course;
I will miss everyone and am really thankful for how much Soness helped
with my speaker sheet.</p>

Who are my 7 Samurai to support me in this?
What effect will this have on a higher universal level if I do this?
What will get me from here to there?</p>

<p>Several meetings today, including with men&rsquo;s group and Soness and
others.</p>

<h2 id="13-33-friday-20-april-2018-jst">13:33 Friday 20 April 2018 JST</h2>

<p>So far so good!  Good feedback from attendees and should be meeting
with Soness soon.  Wanna ask her how to prepare for Toastmasters
meeting tonight.</p>

<p><em>Bio</em></p>

<p>Walking on stage, you immediately notice something .. off.  Rob is
barefoot!  Was it a mistake?  Did he lose his shoes?  Turns out he has
gone barefoot as much as possible for 15 years.</p>

<p>He talks about authentic speaking, being vulnerable with others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s difficult sometimes, but it&rsquo;s worth it.&rdquo;  Is he talking about
going barefoot or talking about being vulnerable?</p>

<p>Then you realize he is talking about emotional honesty in a men&rsquo;s
circle.  &ldquo;What is a men&rsquo;s circle?&rdquo; you wonder.  &ldquo;Some kind of club?&rdquo;</p>

<p>After founding Tokyo Men&rsquo;s Group, Rob started a group for women.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The methods work,&rdquo; he says.  &ldquo;I know from experience my relationship
with my wife has improved.  My relationship with everyone has
improved, by looking inside at the dark corners of myself&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is he even talking about?&rdquo; you wonder, but he looks excited,
saying something about lowering the suicide rate in Japan.</p>

<p>Pretty lofty vision, but could it work?  Could speaking about problems
really help them?</p>

<p>You settle in for the talk, and soon find yourself wondering at the
possibilities.  What would it be like to have a mission in life?  What
would it be like to have support in completing my mission?</p>

<p>After all the speakers, you head home, but still can&rsquo;t stop wondering
about that barefoot guy.  What was his name again?  You get out the
bio sheet and read.</p>

<p>Rob is American living in Tokyo. He walks around barefoot as an
example to let people be themselves and not worry about what others
may think.  Starting personal growth work in 1997, he is now the
representative in Japan for The Mankind Project (mkp.org), founding
and leading two peer counseling circles here.</p>

<p>He listens patiently, allowing his clients time to feel and be present
in the moment.  He models being vulnerable and imperfect.  &ldquo;The key to
happiness is letting myself be me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The above shows a weird thing that happened to my git repo while I was messing with Fossil.  The commit 6086901 is the first, and the commit 354c77e is the last, but it was shown right in a row.</p>

<p>This is the current top of the commit. Turns out the weird append was due to two different branches having identical, but non-related histories.</p>

<p>I <code>git push --force</code> to break it and fix it again.  Not sure if I went
with the original history or a new one.</p>

<h2 id="00-25-sunday-22-april-2018-jst">00:25 Sunday 22 April 2018 JST</h2>

<p>I wrote the comments above to fix the layout of the commits.</p>

<p>For some reason when I <code>fossil push</code> it says wrong project, and it pushes the project properly.</p>

<p>Easy lessons today because Patrick was out.  After combining the 4:30
classes, we played a game with target language &ldquo;May I have a card,
please?,&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ＿＿＿＿-ing,&rdquo; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re ＿＿＿＿-ing,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hey ＿＿＿＿,
let&rsquo;s go ＿＿＿-ing,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sorry I can&rsquo;t.  I&rsquo;m busy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Matt is also out today, so I&rsquo;ll teach his 6pm lesson.</p>

<p>New regular students in SS lesson this morning; Kaede stopped coming
relatively soon after joining last year, and Chika apparently took my
bitcoin advice (whereas I did not haha) so she moved overseas.
Satoshi has not come recently, and Sayuri said she was busy today,
plus said Ayano something something so could not come.  Nonoka and Ai
came today.  Ai helped Nonoka with some phrases and months of the
year.  We played a little month game asking the date of Christmas,
Halloween, Tanabata, White Day, etc.</p>

<p>Now I am in a cafe on ground floor of Muza watching pigeons and peeps
walk, fly, and or meander through the breezeway.</p>

<p>I did only about 56 minutes of MT3 today before I glued a piece and
had to pause.  The large sized marble has been lifted up onto the
track; the little brother has gotten back onto the stage and is
fighting the big brother; the manager has just placed a little
toothpick rail on the small marble track that meanders down from the
ball splitter.</p>

<p>Had a very interesting dream last night.  Most of the following was
transcribed in a text message to Christine while walking to the
station.</p>

<p class="dream">I was out on a field and we saw a spaceship flying
above the clouds; it was moving to and fro, and had large glowing
green and red lights illuminating large portions of the clouds around
it.  As it was coming down I was like "that's a UFO" and some people
said "don't look at it" as if that might make it go away.  I very
carefully looked at it and mentally invited them to come down.</p>

<p class="dream">It came down through the clouds and had different
lights shining in different directions not like spotlights but kind of
diffuse lights green and red.  It was a round disk that came down but
what arrived was only like just seats as if maybe of an amusement park
ride.  The seats were red and thin, like padding plywood, like a
simply a seat and then eat some small handles that look like vertical
pads, like seats and pads of a workout machine, but without the
machine.</p>

<p class="dream">I got into a seat after another girl got into one and
she was like "oh this is so cool" and after I sat down on it I had the
experience of being lifted up by the seat and for a moment was worried
that I would be like required to to fight but that did not happen. I
floated up above the field where it had been and did like a backwards
loop and then back down and then lift it up.</p>

<p>In my normal flying dreams I don&rsquo;t do loops like that so that was
different.</p>

<p class="dream">The spaceship lifted up and we were flying over a
terrain of geometric shapes and I addressed someone saying "how may I
help you, sir?" and he said "it's not sir," so I asked the question
again he reflected the question back to me, all how may he help me, so
I said I needed to be back within a few Earth minutes of when we were
picked up. He did not seem surprised by that.  OR, if possible, help
me pack all my stuff before the boat arrives, (because in the previous
moment of my dream we were just a couple days left sailing on a cruise
ship and was about to be in panic pack mode).  We were in a laboratory
and I floated around the room a little and he asked me about a
contacts case and was like "so what's this?" and I said "oh that
refracts light" and tried to describe briefly the human eyes work with
a lens and retina and he seemed interested in that, plus how something
so thin could could help someone see properly and maybe was looking at
something else and then</p>

<p>my alarm went off just a couple minutes after the dream started that
was interesting.</p>
