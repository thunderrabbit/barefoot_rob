<p>Ashley just left to get her stuff at Chez's house and then
presumably go home to OKC.  I slept on the couch last night and Ashley
gave me a hug on her way out.</p>

<p>"Have fun in far away places," she encouraged.</p>

<p>"I will," I smiled. "Thank you."</p>

<p>"I don't know if I'll see you again..."</p>

<p>Eeep.  That monsterous beautiful process of life raises its head
again.  "Um," I said, for I was tired, "I have an email address that
will be good for a really long time."</p>

<p>"Okay."</p>

<p>"Do you know my last name?"  Not all my youth do.</p>

<p>"Nugen." she said in a way that she knew it was correct, but didn't
know what was the point of the query.</p>

<p>"My address is <a href="mailto:rob@robnugen.com">rob at robnugen
dot com</a>."</p>

<p>"That's easy."</p>

<p>"If you write me, I'll write you back; I just don't know how long
it will take."</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Thanks for being so great."</p>

<p>"You're welcome?" she assured me.  "Thanks for being so <em>fun</em>."</p>

<p>"You're welcome."  It's the greatest pleasure in the world to be an
advisor for YRUU.  "See you later."</p>

                        <p class=date>10:39am CDT Thursday 8 August 2002</p>

<p>Sean and I are about to go ride bikes.</p>

<p class=date>11:24am</p>

<p>Drove to his dad's house to get Sean's soes and backpack.   Now
he's filling his camelpack with water to drink on our adventure.</p>

<p class=date>3:48pm</p>

<p>Wow.  I'm back.  Sean is at Hart's house.  Our adventure took us to
White Rock Lake, to the water treatment plant near the spillover.
Rode along the dam (this time on the horizontal surface designed for
bikes instead of the slanted surface designed for water) to the
spillover and though I was ready to climb the fence into it, Sean
didn't seem so gung ho about the idea.  I trusted his concern and we
just rode around the perimeter, where lots of signs said we were
forbidden to walk, swim, wade, anything near the spillover.  Fine.</p>

<p>Rode along the lake to a dock, and then to a tree that, from the
dock, appeared to be on a penninsula.  Then continued around the lake
and saw a guy sitting on the back of his truck.  He wore a dirty blue
mechanic button up shirt and blue jeans and his truck was pretty well
dented.  Waved to him and he waved back; I decided to turn around and
talk to him so we did.  Turns out he's 70 years old as of March 1st,
and has lived in Dallas area since 1968.  When he was younger, they
didn't know what they didn't have so they didn't want for anything.
There were no TVs and radios advertising to buy all this stuff.  So
they were happy with just a rock and a stick.</p>

<p>He served in the military (he didn't mention any wartime service)
and was in San Francisco or something and then moved to Dallas.  In
1972 he was working on his air conditioner outside, and an air
conditioner mechanic was at the neighbor's house, offered to look at
the unit for free.  Our friend said naw, and just put some WD-40 on
the unit, and he told his wife to turn it on, "the fan jumped so high
into the air, it was over the roof.  Cost me 1700 dollars to get it
fixed."  It was near the end of the summer so they were going to sweat
it out, but that lasted about 1 day and his wife said, "we're getting
it fixed tomorrow."</p>

<p>We rode on and made it all the way around the lake.  Oh, we ate a
sandwich each in there somewhere, and looked through a binocular
telescope thing set up near the lake.  Looked at downtown and birds
and stuff.</p>

<p>Sean chose to go home and hang out with Hart, so I continued alone.
Rode along some unused railroad tracks (I could tell they were unused
because the rails had been removed) and that was nice and flat and
straight, but the gravel took up a lot of energy from my wheels and
legs.  Found a real railroad track crossing over my missing tracks and
ascended the incline and rode along the tressel of this other track
(that was actually a bit scary) with tar and oil on many of the ties,
and bone shaking bumpbumpbumpbumpbumpbumpbumpbumpbump along the enire
thing.  The tressel ended and I maintained my speed in gear 3 - 4 or
so and bumpbumpbumpbumpbumpbumpbumpbumpbumped along the tracks around
a curve until I arrived at Highland (Drive Road | Street | something)
and noticed that my left pedal had shaken loose again.  D'oh!</p>

<p>I asked a mailman how I could get to Mockingbird and 75.  He didn't
really know cause this wasn't his normal route.  I went sorta back
toward the direction from which I had come and saw a woman out
watering her lawn.  I asked her if she had an allen wrench.  Turns out
she did have one, but it was the wrong size.  He neighbor wasn't home,
so she pointed me back along Highland to Fergusen, where I could find
some mechanic type shops.  The first one had nothing, the second shop
helped me tighten it a bit with a screwdriver, and I rode down
Fergusen to I-30 and found a gas station that had the correct size
allen wrench.  Excellent!  Tightened the shit out of my crank and
filled up my water bottle, tipped the guy a dollar for his help.  Rode
along 30 for a bit and then took Samuel up along Tin-something
Memorial Park and then toward highway 75 (therefore toward the Bibby's
house).</p>

<p>But first I recognized the neighborhood where Janette's work is
located, so I went in to say HI to her a bit.  My bike got a light
dusting of white paint as I parked it near where Angelo was painting
some white fence looking things.  HI to Janette and got directions
from her to get to her house.</p>

<p>By the time I was near her house, while on flat ground I was in
gear 2 2 or 2 3.  up a hill I was in 2 1.  Tired tired.</p>

<p>Glad to be back and thankful for such a grand adventure!</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>Peering over the edge of some rough clay bluff (about
20 feet tall) I witnessed the process of life as ants were attacking a
velvet ant.  I climbed down for a closer look and saw more ants
chewing on a butterfly or something.  I really really wanted to help
the butterfly by picking it up, but I just sent it positive thoughts
with my mind and encouraged it to have the strength to fly free.</p>

<p class=dream>It flew up out of the ants reach and then there was another
different color butterfly in the same predicament who also flew free
after a bit.</p>

<p class=dream>They had gotten away from the ants but were now in a dank cellar
that didn't seem to be the best place for butterflies to be.  The
second one was closest to me, so I put my finger out that it my climb
onto and it (the butterfly) clawed me with one of its claws and I was
like yeow and pulled away from it and left it to fend for itself.</p>

<p class=dream>The other butterfly was on the floor and had used its
wings to cover itself up like in a box.  I saw that its skin had the
slightest gold tinge over it like a sheen of gold paint, or like the
chrysalis of some types of butterflies.  Its box opened up and the
butterfly woke up as if from a deep slumber and it looked like a small
human figure, like a muppet butterfly might look with little fuzzy
face and two arms and two legs and little boots except one of its legs
had broken off at the hip and I was like, "oh god" cause I had roused
this butterfly from its final slumber, it knew it was time to die and
had built its little coffin, and when I woke it up, the butterfly
tried to put its leg back on like a pulling on some tall boots and it
was just so tragic I cried cried cried in my dream until I woke
up.</p>

<p>I'm at the Bibby's; Sean, Joey, Jackie, Ashley are chilling,
talking about who is anti-sexual and who is uber-sexual.  Ashley just
said, "I watched my brother be born," and I thought Joey said that!  I
was all, "whahhattttt??"</p>

<p>So the reason I'm writing is that Jo just described the best job
ever: being a massage guinea pig and eating ice cream.</p>

<p>We just played Wahoo!, which is a lot like Parcheesi.  The board is
a big 2.5 x 2.5 foot sheet of plywood with holes drilled in it.
Ashley won and had to yell "wahoo!"  Sean got second placed and had to
say "wah."  Jackie got third place and had to say "who" and I got last
place.  According to Joey the loser would have a single tear rolling
down their cheek.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Ashley quotes:</p>

<p>"I remember you and Jason at my first Houston Rally, you ate all
that gum.  I used to think that Jason was dreamy, but not
anymore."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Quotes from Josephine:</p>

<p>"Yeah, he was like 'something or other blah blah
blah.'"</p>

<p>"Sean has teets!"</p>

<p>"Now it just says 'penis!'"</p>

<p>"We make a lot of stuff from scratch around here...  Not like eggs,
but you know."</p>

<p>"Jackie's sick; she won't know the difference."</p>

<p>"Did you guys know that confectioners' sugar is powdered sugar?
Well it is."</p>

<p>"<b>What is <em>that</em>??</b>"</p>

<p>"There was this really great word, but I forgot what it was."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Sean: "how do horses brush their hair?"</p>

<p>Sean says that in fifty years the text that is typed on the screen
will be visible through the apple on the back of the screen.  "It will
be called the Bibby Hole."</p>

<p>"I guess I didn't go."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Jackie's voice is scratchy; she's coughing a lot, so Janette made
her some hot tea and orange slices and a cherry.</p>

<p>Quotes from Jackie:</p>

<p>"I'm not a stand up comedian, I'm just a mugbook creator."</p>

<p>"Sitch Titch a Ritch Bitch"</p>

<p>"I'mantidisestablishmentarianism tantidisestablishmentarianism

<p>"Oh, it's in my other pocket."</p>

<p>Funny Rob quotes:</p>

<p>"I'll vouch for you and tell her that you couldn't call cause you
were in jail."</p>

<p>"Oh no, we insist, sleep outside."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Ashley and Joey made cupcakes while Jackie and I chatted in
the living room.  Quite entertaining to hear their occassional squeals
or shrieks or laughter.  Sean roamed back and forth between the rooms
as he saw fit.</p>

<p>Cupcakes finished, we chowed and then Jackie and Joey played a game
that Jack taught to Joey - a variation of Egyptian Rat Screw, sorta.
Each player lays down cards and if a face card is put down the players
have to do something and the first person to do it gets the stack of
cards.  For jacks, you have to make an obscene gesture.  For queens,
you have to name a famous woman in history.   For kings, you have to
say something you can't say on the radio.  For aces, you have to name
a country in Europe.  Quite an entertaining game!</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Jackie went home at 1:30 as requested by her parents.  Ashley and
Joey played for a bit; Sean went to bed.  I stayed up till 3am looking
for Kazaa Lite for Mac OS X, signing up for comics from <a
href="https://www.comics.com">comics.com</a>, and signing up for the <a
href="https://www.TheHarrowGroup.com/">Harrow Technology
Report</a>. </p>

<p>Happy birthday Bryn!</p>

<p class=date>10:01pm</p>

<p>Janette and I just got back from her work after putting in 12.5
hours of work (minus lunch).</p>

<p>We wrassled with a second ridiculously large curtain.  I mean, just
a single panel is 4.5 feet wide and 40 feet tall!  The curtain was
made up of 25 panels sewn together along their 40 foot sides, making a
grand total area of 112.5 by 40 feet or 4500 square feet!!  And let me
assure you, this was not a curtain made out of chantilly lace.  It was
heavy curtain fabric, a pukey orange color.  Fortunately, I pointed
out, it was also not made chainmail.</p>

<p>I was flat amazed at the calibre of the project.  Huge monster
project, the size of a large elephant.  I wouldn't have been able to
sew more than two strips together, if that.  Diane was somehow able to
sew multiple strips together, and Janette was somehow able to sew
multiple strips sections to other multiple strip sections.  Huge!
Scads of fabric heaping and trying to fall off the table all over the
place.</p>

<p>The table was only 28 feet long and 6 feet wide with a 5x5 square
foot section added to one end.  Hardly enough for the entire curtain,
even when all wadded up.</p>

<p>I'm super thankful for the work!</p>

<p>After work Janette and I played tennis on the newly paved tennis
court in their neighborhood.  I sucked.  I could pretty much hit the
ball each time it came vaguely close to me, but getting just that
correct angle was a challenge.  I often launched the ball out of the
court, once into the street, once behind the court, again into the
street, and once into the trees on the other side of the court (when
we switched sides, there were trees more closely looming over the
court on the side I was facing, so they blocked the balls from going
out everytime I hit them too hard).</p>

<p>About 1/3 of the time I would get a good shot back vaguely in
Janette's direction.  Usually she would have to run some to get to the
ball.</p>

<p>Then we swang on the swings for a bit.  The chains were relatively
short, so I was quickly at the apex of swinging and would come
thunking back onto the chains each time.  I lept out of the seat a few
times, marking with an old green ribbon how far away I landed.  The
second time I beat my first attempt by about 2 inches, but I never got
past that, and then each time I got worse and worse until I made a
desperate 1 leg landing and ninja roll to keep from knocking the wind
out of myself.</p>

<p>Then to play frisbee we went on the other side of the park, where
there were no dogs who might want to chew on a disc.  We didn't play
too long before Janette got a bruise on her finger and choose to quit
after not much longer.  So we climbed a nearby tree with huge
sprawling branches that I easily climbed without using my hands.</p>

<p>The main difficulty in climbing was the number of branches all
over; like a crowded freeway of tree parts.  One branch I climbed was
not as easy.  Its diamter was about 5 or 6 inches and it ascended 6
feet at and angle of about 45 or 50 degrees from horizontal.  It
started quite near the ground, so I wasn't too worried about falling.
I made it up and noticed the branches of another tree nearby...
Hmmmm.</p>

<p>It looked like it would hold me, but I wasn't sure.  I leaned over
and grabbed on, but the tree gave too much for me to feel comfortable
with leaping from my stable branch.  So I pushed myself back to
standing on my branch and turned around to descend again.  I
<em>almost</em> made it all the way down, but lost my balance when I
lept from my branch to the same branch about a foot lower and
horizontal.  Bonked my back against an upward sticking old dead
branch.  Didn't hurt too much.</p>

<p>Chilled on a park bench until the mosquitoes came out.</p>

<p>Today Janette came home for lunch and offered me a job at her work
doing manual labor.  Excellent!  I had just been wondering if I could
work there.  Really.</p>

<p>I worked today for 3.5 hours at her work, a big prop-making
warehouse thing.  I helped her sew a hem 110 feet long at the bottom
of a 40 foot tall curtain.  Excellent!</p>

<p>Great fun nearly wallowing in so much fabric as we moved it across
and around the table to pin it and help her sew it.  We actually got
about 1/2 the hem sewed; we'll do the other half tomorrow.</p>

<p>This morning Marta and I walked around the nearby small lake with
1/8th mile markers all around it.  The markers are lines of brick in
the sidewalk and say "1/8th mile" on the right hand side when viewed
from either direction.  They all said 1/8th mile and bore no other
specifically distinguishing marks that might allow a person to more
easily count how many 1/8th miles have been walked.</p>

<p>After 4 or so 8th miles, we found a large wooden climbing thing
with walkways and sturdy handrails and chains and poles - perfect for
climbing all over.  I followed Marta around for a bit in a game of
follow the leader where anyone who steps on lava must go to the end of
the line (short line with just two of us).  While crossing a suspended
bridge thing and leaping to a corner of the structure, Marta's foot
touched the ground and I got to be the leader.  She followed me along
the shakey foot chains and even up to a different level, but was
unwilling to go down then back up a slide and balance on the handrails
throughout the structure.</p>

<p>We met a kid name Brandon, who looked to be about 3 years old.  His
dad would have lost follow the leader 100 times faster than Marta, but
he wasn't playing so that's okay.  Marta was standing on a table and
Brandon was all, "you don't stand on tables" and I debated debating
him that it was an outdoor table and the world is not as simple as you
think and all that shit, but I chose not to.  But I also chose not to
step off the seat around the table even though "you don't stand on a
chair" but instead climbed over to the fence surrounding the
playground.</p>

<p>I wound my way along the fence while Brandon watched and presumably
searched for a statement regarding climbing along walls, but he
remained silent and soon was climbing on the wooden structure again.</p>

<p>My goal was to leap from the fence to the wooden swingset
structure, but when I leapt it sorta cracked (the swingset support) so
I aborted mission.  I don't think I could have done it without
touching lava even if it hadn't cracked, but I definitely didn't try
again.</p>

<p>Balanced up on handrails with the goal of climbing all over this
thing without using my hands.  Did pretty well considering the
handrails changed in height every few feet, and they weren't
ridiculously sturdy (they were only fairly sturdy) and there weren't
super great places to fall since the structure was so mazelike in its
design.  No big flat landing areas.  Fortunately I didn't need to use
any.</p>

<p>I tried to climb where Brandon couldn't see me and get some tall
ideas in his mind quite yet.  I touched the ground while dangling from
the side of something trying to step up to a nearby fence or
something.</p>

<p>Then I discovered a marble track type thing.  It was metal ramps
and pegs and a single marble (that I actually doubt was the original
designed for the track) and lots of bits of wood and bottle caps and
crap that stupid people put in there without regard to those who might
want to play with it later.</p>

<p>I searched briefly for a stick and found none, but noticed some
reeds about 50 yards away and jumped the fence (making sure Brandon
couldn't see me) and ran over, found a stick, jumped the fence (again)
and used it to clean out all of the bottle caps and most of the wooden
bits that clogged the toy.  I got most everything out so the marble
would consistently make it down the whole thing.  Totally awesome.</p>

<p>I was also totally sweaty having been climbing all over, running
around, standing in the sun, so we headed back to the apartment for
lunch.</p>

<p>Just finished our YRUU meeting at Plano.  Had three visitors via
Jordan: Sarah, Ayla, Amanda.  David is on his way out; he wasn't at
the lockin, but he was here tonight.  Everyone else was at the
lockin.  Jackie was not here today.</p>

<p>We played a name game, and then Ten Fingers, and then two rounds of
Mafia.  I was a townsperson both times.  Fun stuff.  Jordan was God
first and then Marta.  Each time Mafia woke up, I pointed at different
people or myself, but usually pointed to myself and mimed "no no no
I'm an angel."  One time I did The Chicken Dance, and once I did The
Macarena.  Twice, actually. It worked pretty well: A couple of times I
could hear people laugh, which gave them away as mafia.</p>

<p>Now Marta and I are going to Dallas to hang with some of her
friends and then I'm going to the Bibby's for a few days.</p>
