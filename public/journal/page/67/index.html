<p><div class="dream">I got an email from my friend saying her sister had
died.  She decided to tart a new estaurnt like The Pink Cow which was
really friendly and had great food so we went there to check it out
and it was super busy so I asked them about making a reseration but it
was a bit confusing about what time we would be able to get ther
because our driver would be avaialble at 10am or 10pm and neither time
was exactly convenient</p></p>

<p>Insert lots of forgotten dream / non-REM sleep here&hellip;</p>

<p><div class="dream">Looking down at the huge elevator taking the plane
down to the launch zone, it went down toddown and then magnetic launch
zoooomm right out over the water so awesomely fast and then I was
shocked to see the plane didnt make it up to full speed and kinda
slowed down and sloshed down into the water.  They were okay and the
plane dove down into the ground and came back out in the mountain and
shook the wter out of the engine and tried again.  then it was our
turn and our plane was hurling through the hallway and the a overhead
speakder was like I think we want eleven. and I wrote that into my
diary starting a new paragraph</p></p>

<p><div class="dream">Fabulous, they said I think we want eleven WTF you
don&rsquo;t know what you want??</p></p>

<p><div class="dream">And then I went to write down the timestamp and the
clock said 1999 and the woman next to me saw it too, and then it said
19:59 and I jokingly said, okay there you go it&rsquo;s 19:59 but then it
switched to 19:65 and then 19:70 and I then I went to write that down
and could not find on the page where I had written &ldquo;Fabulous&rdquo; and then
I was like waitaminut this is a dream and woke up</p></p>

<p>We are going to get on the flight in several hours from now.  I wonder
when I will start to reverse my sleep schedule.  We are 11 hours
behind Tokyo, so not as far away as possible, but close.</p>

<p>I have just gotten out my computer (to work on ConSwi) when I realized
I should be sleeping.</p>

flying to Sao Paulo.  Our flight to Dubai leaves at 1am Sunday

play rummy.  I had never played before.</p>

<p>Lin and I ate lunch with R &amp; D and D&rsquo;s auunt R and three of R&rsquo;s
nephews.  I took the longest to eat due to chewing chewing chewing.
The meat was a bit tough given that we arrived near the end of their
lunch session.  D drove me, Lin and his aunt R in the Range Rover,
while R drove his three nephews in a rental car.</p>

<p>Now, shopping.</p>
