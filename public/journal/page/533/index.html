<p>Got crazy lost on the way to Pizza Hut, and
somehow, though we found Pizza Hut with UU young
adults at it, it was the wrong Pizza Hut.  But Jason
has now reached his peeps.</p>

<p>Super great to sit by Bryn now, listening to her
stories.</p>

<p>Dr Pepper is not enjoyed in OZ.  Beaner is glad to
be able to order Dr Pepper, and get.. Dr Pepper!!</p>

<p>Fabulous story spilled passionately by Bryn and
Sean about their crazy river trip where Joey didn't
die.</p>

<p>Eskie = cooler</p>

<p class=date>10:02 pm

<p>We played the alphabet game:</p>

<pre>
A
Bitchin Camaro
Came Drivin'
Down the street
Easy Ridin'
From the ghetto
Grandly displaying
His cool taillights
In top gear
Jammin' to the beat
Kickin' out rhymes
Livin' large
Money Makin'
Noise breakin
On the road
Pickin' up chicks
Quickly
Rejecting em
Saving face with the homeboys by
Tellin' lies
Unaware of the
Vibes
Which make an angel cry and makin'
Xena
Yell like a
Zulu warrior princess
</pre>

<p>We're leaving Pizza hut now.</p>

<p>Got <em>* so much *</em> done at work today.  I
really am motivated to work work work when I'm going
on vacation the next day!</p>

<p>The only stinky thing today is that we didn't get
to see Will and the rest of the choir sing the
National Anthem at the baseball game today.  I tried
to get free tickets, but it didn't work out, and by
the time we tried more conventional methods, we
couldn't get any.  Doh!  I wrote him a nice letter as
a make-up.</p>

<p>Wende is packing; I'm basically packed; Jason is
here and we're hanging out.</p>

<p>I'm slinging through my email so I have fewer
messages when I get back.</p>

<p>Oh shit!  I didn't put an instant reply out-of-town
message on my email at work.  I'm gonna go back in
tonight.</p>

<p>Jason and I are still at my work.  I got my email
out-of-town thing set up pretty readily, and I called
a guy in Singapore who was having trouble with his
username and password.  Got that resolved, but we are
still working on one project:</p>

<p>Sharpen 100 pencils for SWUUSI</p>

<p>Yes, we are sharpening pencils, and we have an
electric sharpener, which was presumed to be a faster
technique than doing them by hand, but(!), the
sharpener overheated after sharpening 10 pencils.  It
takes about 10 minutes to cool down enough to do 5
more pencils.  This could take a long time.  We have
sharpened almost 30 pencils.</p>

<p>In an hour.</p>

<p>So I went to get some ice from the fridge, but
there was none.  So, I got frozen vegetables and put
them around the sharpener.  I'm not sure if they
helped, but it sure is funny.</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>I did it.  I have written code that will create a new survey in under 1
minute.  In fact, once all the parameters are given, which takes about 30
seconds, the survey is created in about 1 second.</p>

<p>Now, to be perfectly clear, this is so far only running on my machine; I
haven't moved it online yet.  I'll do that tomorrow, presuming all other
testing works out on my box.</p>

<p>Such an incredibly fucking awesome success to have this done!!</p>

<p>Great fun playing ultimate tonight!  I've not
played in a really long time.  We only had about 13
people there at most, so we barely had enough to have
subs.</p>

<p>I emerged from the evening with nice clean scrapes
on my knees.  By clean I mean smooth, but not
<em>clean</em> cause they were pretty much covered in
dirt.  The hair was smoothly removed, along with the
first few layers of skin, leaving a nice glistening
pinkish oval on my left knee.  I scrubbed it with Dr
Bronner's Magic Soap, and then hydrogen peroxide,
which burned so good.</p>

<p>Now it's all bandaged with triple antibiotic
ointment.</p>

<p>I played without a bandage on my toe, which has a
full covering of skin, but it's just not as thick as
it had been.  Still a tad tender, but amazingly well
healed for only 5 days.  Good job, toe!</p>

<p>The Muppets were all riding in a bus with the band, and Dr Teeth
was driving.  Motorcycle cop comes up behind them with lights
flashing.  Kermit approaches Dr Teeth politely.</p>

<p>"Um, Dr Teeth, can you pull over?"</p>

<p>Dr Teeth, gleefully: "easier done than said, Frog!!"</p>

<p class=date>5:16am CDT Wednesday 18 July 2001</p></p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>Outside at a televised sporting event, in a football
field, except that the field was only in preparation mode fort he
sporting event.  Along one side of the track we saw a large metal
framework that defined the dimensions of a stage for groups to perform
during halftime.</p>

<p class=dream>We marveled at how intricate the metal structure was,
and how precisely measured all the different lengths were.  I noted
that the height of the frame's stage was exactly the same height as
the bed of a flatbed 18 wheeler.  Quite convenient.</p>

<p class=dream>Colleen was sitting up on the other side of the frame
and hollered down at me, "He rob!  Do you like our frame?  We built
this during my metals working class!"  Obviously I was totally
impressed with the workmanship exhibited by the class members.  "Wow!!
 totally amazing that you guys built this!"  I couldn't see any flaws
with it.</p>

<p class=dream>Colleen explained how some of the joints were made, and
which ones she had worked on.  She told me that the welds are
extremely hot, and the heat could even be felt the next <em>day</em>
after welding had been done.  wow.</p>

<p>Hung out with Kristen this afternoon.  Not the Kristen I was dating
over a year ago, but Lawschool Kristen, who I met at UH back in the
day, and who is now attending lawschool in New England.</p>

<p>We just talk talk talked for 3 hours.  Actually mostly she talked,
because she's quite entertaining, and has this way of telling spirals
of circular stories that weave around one another until the point of
the story is reached, only to begin another tangent that is its own
story.</p>

<p>She's doing great in school, but doesn't have a job yet.  This is
kinda disconcerting, but not so much so that she's willing to just
take any ol' job that she can get.</p>

<p>We went to Whole Foods and saw Johnny there!!!  Johnny is the cute
cashier who Wende and I met at the old Whole Foods location, and had a
"HI Johnny!" relationship with over a few month period.  We mourned
the day he went to Seattle, but he's back in Houston now!  Yay
Johnny!</p>

<p>Kristen and I shared her chicken fried chicken and mashed potatoes,
and we each got an Odwalla supergreen algae drink to drink.  I got
freshly ground peanut butter because it's the best best best.  Not for
dinner, but to take to work.</p>

<p>Kristen just left to go work.  She works as a cashier in a club
near downtown.</p>

                        <p>This is from a friend Dave, who I met through the
Bluebonnet Council hostel office here in Houston. 
He's an avid bicyclist, and is currently cycling
across part of Europe:</p>

dear all,
     we had a swell time camping in Amsterdam,
breezing past
Anne Frank's house & some other historical stuff,
cafes,
red lightr district with its window ladies, who i
kinda
felt sorry for.  Took a road trip up to Zaanse Schaans
with
all its windmills & quaint houses in the
polders/dikes.
Had to go back to the airport to pick up Butch's bike
which
had gone to Singapore so we got a late start across
the
netherlands.  got to amersfoort on the bike paths, but
the
5 guys we were with had gone on ahead in a speed racer
kinda
way.  we thought they must have seen the huge sign of
bike
turns for Arnhem, so after waiting for a while, we
went on
toward it.  We left a message at the next turnoff
after we
waited at some picnic tables, not sure if they were
ahead or
behind.  We ended up camping at a nature park with
picnic
tables b4 arnhem, cuz it was almost midnite.  we made
it to
emmerich on the border of germany the next afternoon ,
so we
waited at the bahnhof a bit, then headed for freiburg
on the
cheapweekend ticket.   ($20 for 2)  got there after
midnight
sunday morning,l but still no 5.  slept in the station
then
got woke up an hour later to show our tickets. then
had to get
up at 5am anyway.  raining, so didn't go to the tour
de france,
but took a 9am train for munich;  didn't stay there,
but went
on to Berchtesgaden near the border of austria. (to
get the
most use out of our ticket).  wondering where the guys
were,
but having good times even in the rain, we camped near
the
touristy lake & climbed a 24% grade up to Hitler's
bunker
(saw it) then zoomed down to the salt mines, but too
many
people waiting to see em, so went on the salzburg...
hostel
on the hill was full, cooked dinner with view, then on
to
camping a km from train station (with view) FOR THE
USUAL $6.
still raining when got up, so may take train to Linz
to start
riding down the danube river for the vienna (wien)
races.
hoping to see the guys there ..love dave
</pre>

<p>What is most interesting to me is that he's just
rattling off stuff they saw, and stuff they did.  Not
like, "Oh My Gosh, we got to see Anne Frank's
<em>house!!</em>" or "The view was so spectacular we
could see for miles!"</p>

<p>So, when will I adjust my life enough to take such
a bicycling tour of Europe?  Can I do this and still
have my job, and still attend SWUUSI each year, and
still do whatever else I do?  Why am I making this so
confusing?</p>

<p>I imagine a little research toward this adventure
will help.</p>

Hello sistas' and brothas',
     Oh life is pure extasy on any given Tuesday in
paradise.  A good friend of mine from Holland is
traveling with me for a few weeks and speaking Dutch
with me when i beg like a hungry dutch  dog.  Last
night when i decided we were going to camp on a tiny
beach right in the middle of this big city (under the
lighthouse) and picnic on a fine red wine, french
cheeze, pastries, olives and a salad over the ocean,
he told me the Dutch have a saying that goes; "living
as the gods in France".  This is especially reserved
for a life of plenty.  I can relate, very good drugs
could not make this better.  I have been walking the
beaches and cliffs and swamp lands of coastal France
for two weeks, on the sunny days getting neeked in the
waves and exposing my lilly whiteness to the sun. 
Every day brings a new emotion to explore.  Now that I
am not lost all day (everyday) i can focus on the here
and now and try not to reflect or anticipate too much.
 I am taking a break from the mind chatter every
chance i get.  Feeling lost did give me large
obsticles of frustration to explore and larger lessons
to process and incorporate into my database.  The suns
rays dancing on the water are much more reassuring,
and the special sinking deep into the soft sand adds a
certain element of challenge  that i do not have on
the other paths.  I measure how far i have traveled
with my finger on the little map I have, an easy day
is one finger, a real foot-blistering day is two.  It
has rained almost every night for the last weeks since
I have been on the coast.  My little tent is holding
up quite well, last night on the beach during a storm
was another great endurance test, we were mostly dry
in the AM.  The ocean is amazing.  I constantly thank
all the powers that made this possible, and have been
singing seasmie street in all the languages i know the
tune in, thanking the sunny days and the beautiful
people of the path.  The french people are golden,
they have been pure love and wish me unending courage
as they watch me walk by with my huge and heavy back
pack.  Sometimes folks ask where I am headed and I
tell them I am a pilgrim on the Route du Saint Jaques
du Compostella Starting in Normandy (north France) and
walking to Galicia (spain),  everyone knows this
pilgrimage and it is a big deal, and i feel so honored
and am realizing it is mutual.  My french is still
getting better, and the other day someone asked me if
I was French.  Wow, it is definetly not that good, but
i hope someday it will be.  I almost expect to be
asked to sing a solo at every party i arrive at, the
last time a mike was shoved into my hand and I was
asked to sing for a village party.  I really belted it
out, singing my song about Durango, Mexico.  I think
this afternoon i will look up the lyrics to a couple
more Sinatra tunes.  It is a Franky summer.  I will
probably make it to La Rochelle in a week or two, but
it is time for the beach today.  I am feeling a little
old today, this is the third time in a row I have
looked at my e-mail and seen a friend of mine has
passed on.  It happens to all of us, so live it up! 
Today is a good day, big hugs, lots of warm wishes to
you and your family and respect in the deepest way
from my soul to yours.   
Ultrea, gin
