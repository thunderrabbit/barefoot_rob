<p>Went for a wonderful long walk with Janette.  Talked about us and
me leaving and will we ever see each other again, I hope so, but
things change, and I want you to do whatever is best for you, and
don't do anything just for me, and you're the best thing since sliced
bread, and people change and you might meet someone who is more
perfect, but who knows.. just let it flow, let yourself go.  slow and
low that is the tempo.</p>

<p>All of that except for the line from "Slow Ride" was out sitting on
the rocks by white rock lake and on the grass by the old water factory.</p>

<p>This was the day we climbed the stairs of the tower (10 steps; 1
pi), Janette correctly guessed (after a couple tries) what the
lightning-grounding cables were down the side, the day I walked along
the wall and on the inside of the fence at the spillway, and when the
guy had two very male dogs playing fetch in the expressly forbidden
area of the spillway.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Played on my website; now the WTF pages email address is randomly
selected from a list.  I may use that technology in other places.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Went to see _Chicago_ with Josephine again.  Janette and Jack
joined us; it was their first viewing, my second, Josephine's 4th.</p>

<p>Talked to Lawren online; she'll hopefully be able to come to the
Bibby Blowout on 14-16 March.  You're invited if you know me and
(Janette or Jack or Josephine)</p>

<p>March 4, 2003
To Robert Nugen</p>

<p>Robert, our current information from the SF Office is that you will be
arriving at Narita on Thursday March 27 on UA 897 at 16.00.</p>

<p>The following information aims to guide you through the various stages
of your arrival, from immigration formalities at Narita until you
arrive at your accommodation.</p>

<p>There are two terminals at Narita. Your flight is due to arrive at
Terminal 1. Most flights will park at the gate, but there may be a bus
ride to the terminal in some cases. If you are arriving at Terminal 2,
depending on where your flight disembarks, there may be a short
shuttle train ride to the main airport concourse.</p>

<p>The first thing you will need to do at the airport is to go through
Immigration formalities. You will need to show your passport and the
landing card that will have been distributed during your flight. If
you do not have a completed landing card there are some available in
the immigration lobby. There are 2 sets of booths, one for Japanese
Nationals and one for Foreign Nationals. UNLESS you are entering Japan
on a JAPANESE passport (or have a RE ENTRY PERMIT to Japan in your
passport) then you MUST go to the booths for Foreign Nationals.</p>

<p>Once you have completed Immigration formalities you need to go to the
Customs Hall. Each carousel will have a display showing which flights
it is processing. Collect your luggage then make your way to the
Customs Officers. As in all international airports you need to go
through the green channel if you have nothing to declare and the red
channel if you do. You will need to show your passport again and your
luggage may be inspected.</p>

<p>After you have cleared customs you need to proceed with your luggage
into the Arrival Lobby. This is where our staff will meet you. We aim
to have our staff at the point where you emerge into the lobby. They
will be carrying Nova signs and should be easy to spot. If, for some
reason you cannot immediately locate our staff, then please make your
way to the Meeting Point. In Terminal 1 the meeting area is an alcove
room with a sign in English set back just behind the large arrival
information board. In Terminal 2 if you are unable to locate our staff
please make your way to the ABC Luggage delivery counter and our staff
will meet you there.</p>

<p>If, after 20 minutes or so, you still haven’t located our staff then
please call our office on 03 - 6688 - 4441. We will liase with the
staff at the airport who will then come and find you. Our staff may
also page you if they fail to locate you.</p>

<p>Once you have met up with our staff they will first take you to the
ABC Delivery Service to have your luggage delivered. Nova will cover
the cost of the delivery for 2 pieces of luggage. If you wish to have
extra pieces of luggage delivered you will need to cover those
costs. At present to have 1 piece of luggage delivered costs
1.800yen. ABC will not accept musical instruments for delivery, and
Nova is unable to cover delivery costs of bulky items, such as
surfboards or bicycles. ABC can usually guarantee next day delivery,
and in most cases luggage is delivered the following day. In your
case, as you will be staying in a hotel initially, we will arrange for
your luggage to be delivered on the day you reach your permanent
accommodation. Please pack an overnight bag for your hotel
stay. Obviously, if you are using medication, please keep an adequate
supply with you to last until your luggage arrives at your permanent
accommodation. If your luggage fails to arrive by the time stated by
ABC, then please call our office and we will check with them as to its
whereabouts.</p>

<p>Once your luggage has been delivered there will be time to change
money, have a smoke or get something to eat or drink. Our staff will
hand you your &ldquo;arrival pack&rdquo; and go over its contents with you. They
will also explain how you will travel to your accommodation from the
airport.</p>

<p>There is usually some waiting time before leaving the airport for your
accommodation. The length of this wait depends on the number of
recruits and how many different flights they are arriving on. We aim
to keep waiting time to a minimum, but there may be occasions when a
longer wait is unavoidable.</p>

<p>As your accommodation will not be ready until March 30, you will be
spending the first 2 nights in a hotel. We aim to put you up at the
Shinjuku Sun Route Hotel, although there is a small chance this may
change due to room availability. Our staff will buy tickets for the
journey to your hotel. Our staff will usually accompany you on at
least the initial stage of your journey. If our staff cannot accompany
you into Tokyo then you will be met en route before transferring to
your commuter train. At the end of your journey you will be taken to
your hotel and helped to settle in. Total journey times from Narita to
your accommodation range from 60 minutes to 3 hours. If you encounter
any problems en route you can call our office on 03 6688 4441. You
will be helped to transfer to your permanent accommodation on the
30th.</p>

<p>Finally, if your travel plans change in any way, please notify your
Overseas Office immediately. They will inform us of your new
details. We will then be able to send out updated arrangements to you.</p>

<h1>State of my Life Address</h1>

<p><center>or</center></p>

<p><center><b>now you know what time it is with all my stuff</b></center></p>

<p>(~) Today I recognized that in a month my life will be somewhat
different than it has been in a while.</p>

<p>(!) I'm living at the Bibby's house in Dallas.  Have been for some
months now.  Have had fabulous fun with Janette, reading, walking,
laughing, joking, talking, exploring, romping, chowing, etc etc
etc</p>

<p>(@) Josephine is getting way better at driving; we'll be taking
Scott out again today probably.</p>

<p>(#) I've still got my car Scott, but I'll be giving him to
Josephine soon soon soon.</p>

<p>($) I have my address in Japan!  It's
<pre>
Bell Wistaria #101
1-26-6  Tarumachi
Kohoku-Ku,  Yokohama-Shi
Kanagawa-Ken  222-0001
</pre></p>

<p>(%) I've written to my two new flatmates (Matthew and Frank) to see
if I can bring any scarce-in-Japan items for them, or if there's
anything I should bring for myself.</p>

<p>(^) <a href="/images/hardware/laptop/PowerBook_G4/computer_monkey.jpg"><img
src="/images/hardware/laptop/PowerBook_G4/thumbs/computer_monkey.jpg" align=left
border=0></a> My computer is an Apple Powerbook G4 with 677 MHz
processor, 256 megs of memory, 30 gig hard drive, wireless card,
gigabit ethernet, firewire, 2 USB, plus other ports I don't use.  Its
battery carries it for some (3-4) hours if I'm not using the CD drive
(CD read/write & DVD reader).</p>

<p>(&) the computer sports a "Medicare Waiver Not Required" stamp and
smiley face stamp on the outside cover, gold glitter glue at the
bottom of the screen (front and back), blue stripes above the keyboard
and below the monitor, and a cute monkey sticker to the left of the
touchpad, and bananas to the right.  Oh and scratches on the monitor
from potato chips at SWUUSI 2002.</p>

<p>(*) I've just editted my first image with GIMP on my computer.
Took a bit of doing, but I was able to rotate it, resize the canvas,
and make a thumbnail.</p>

<p>(() Just got a call from my dad who is flying to West Virginia for
Cordie's birthday ... I wanna go too; I've had it in the back of my
mind that I want to go see them (especially Sarah, before she grows up
like Shane did)</p>

<p>()) I've been wearing contacts since a couple days after losing my
glasses Hawaii.  I've ordered some cool new flexible frame glasses
that will be in before I go to Japan.</p>

<p>(-) I'm pretty much behind in reading livejournal; I've reduced the
number of people on my friends list a lot, but I'm still behind;  I
might just give that up altogether for a while.</p>

<p>(~+) I've been working at the Wolf Shop recently.  Got a full 6
days work in last week, then 2 days off and now the weekend off, but
will work again on Monday and hopefully will work steadily until I
need to split overseas (or to WV)</p>

<p>(~~) I've not really been practicing hiragana all that much, and I
don't yet know a way to edit hiragana with emacs (which I use for
writing my journal entries).</p>

<p>(~!) I've received information from Nova about what to expect when
I arrive in Japan.  It's vaguely interesting, and mostly predictable,
but I'll put it up here cause it's the only snippet of an idea of what
it will really be like that I've got.</p>

<p>(~@) I now know how to insert with SSI the navigation on the top of
static pages on my website.  Now I have a WTF section of my site,
though it's not complete yet.  I'm considering adding etcetera next,
and silent football under that.  Plus a bunch of other shit like KTRU
CD reviews, my random philosophizing, and maybe my portion of a
novel.</p>

<p>(~#) I've added some pics to my site.  Journal entries from 10, 11,
18 February 2003.  The 11th and 18th are the best pics of waterfalls,
and the 10th is a pic of Janette, Reen and me.  Yay GIMP!</p>

<p>(~$) It's now 10:47pm.  My whole idea on this started when I
realized my life would soon be way different.  I considered sending
out a mass email to everyone detailing what's up with me, and asking
people to reply back if they want to continue getting State of My Life
updates about once a month or so.  But now I think it's a dumb idea to
email everyone like that so I'm not going to do it.  Instead I'm going
to bed.</p>

                        <p class=date>2:59pm CST Friday 7 March 2003</p>

<p>Good day of errands, getting new glasses (1), mailing my
Application for Visa to enter Japan (2), picking up Janette's sewing
machine (3), picking up Josephine from school (4), visiting TCBY for
ice cream! (5), and going to the correct place to get my glasses (6),
and go home for a big ol' nap (7).</p>

<p>(1) called the office that was close to Janette's house, went over
and was all, "wazzzzah" to them and they're all "????"  and it turns
out that the doctor we called <em>used</em> to be there but has now
moved and a different eyedoctor is in that space.  Freaky.</p>

<p>(2) filled out a PDF version of the application, sent it with my
Certificate of Eligibility and my passport and a new passport photo
(for what, I don't know) to the Consulate-General of Japan in Houston
so they (I think) can verify everything and put the visa into my
passport. Will it be a sticker or an ink stamp?</p>

<p>(3) not too heavy</p>

<p>(4) not too heavy, either.  But she did get to sit on a ladder
instead of a seat, and I drove over the curb on Abrams when I was in
the right turn only lane..  Whoops!</p>

<p>(5) I was focused on getting the rainbow colored vanilla ice cream
with chocolate chip cookie dough mixed in, but they couldn't to that
(ice cream will break the mixer, and no marble slab nor cold stone nor
plastic thing on which to mix by hand), so after she had mixed soft
serve with cookie dough, I requested a blop of the rainbow on top.</p>

<p>(6) I beat Janette by walking once we were within 2 blocks stuck in
left hand turn lane traffic.  Took a bit to get a medical release form
filled out giving Dr Pickering's office permission to FAX the
prescription (which they already FAXed) over, but I ordered fly
flexible frame glasses.  They'll be in ready before I geo to
Japan.</p>

<p>(7) :-)</p>

<p>Janette and I, in our continued pursuit of acting like teenagers,
are sitting on the bank of the river in Austin.  Glorious sunshine
zero clouds.  Bright enough to read my computer screen without using
the backlight.</p>

<p>She's pricing objects for her space in the antique shop, and came
across some hand mirrors.  She was all, "want me to blind you?" as she
reflected the sun onto my shirt.</p>

<p>"Not really," and I grabbed another mirror and reflected it onto
the trees in front of us.</p>

<p>Like two little fairies flitting about the branches our reflected
light beams danced around, chasing each other, jumping from tree to
tree, up and down the trunks, chasing behind and in front of people
walking along the riverside path...  Man we're so funny!</p>

<p>She priced a couple of the mirrors like "Green Sun Mirror $18"</p>

<p>So now when she gets her sales sheet at the end of the month,
she'll remember the story.</p>

<p>I'm reading this from one of the newsletters I've received from Nova:</p>

<pre>
<b>Email & the Internet:</b>

A lot of people are under the impression that Japan has been wired for
years.  In reality, computer based communication is only now becoming
commonplace.  ...  You will not have access to email or the Internet
through Nova.

If you wish to get connected you will have to take care of everything
yourself.  Internet service providers are becoming more and more
common and the average price is about 3000 yen per month.  Companies
such as CompuServe and America Online can also be used in Japan.

<p>This morning I asked Janette if she would superglue the flap of
dead skin to the bottom of my foot (onto the new skin that can handle
superglue, but not a rock or small piece of glass).  She did and when
I got up I decided to not move my foot for a bit and then fall down
when I tried to move with my foot "stuck" to the floor.</p>

<p>While I stood, waiting for the perfect moment for my joke, Janette
was all, "I asked Josephine what she thought about me dating you," and
blah blah "then Josephine said, 'you've been acting like a couple of
teenagers for five months now.  But whatever makes you happy.'"</p>

<p>I started to crack up thinking about my joke; I could hardly finish
my tea.  Finally I got my poker face and then "I better go to work"</p>

<p>[step]</p>

<p>[fall]</p>

<p><em>[BAM]</em> against the refrigerator as I fell.</p>

<p>HAHAHAHAhahahahahahahhahaha!!  I'm so glad Janette and I share our
wonderful sense of humor!</p>

<p>"... and then I, a genius at balancing, suddenly fall...."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I've wondered about the term genius being applied to things other
than mental abilities (artistic, emotional, physical, spiritual)</p>

<p class=date>7:52am</p>

<p>Now I really gotta go to work.</p>

<p>Yay!  Janette is home!</p>

<p>She was watching clouds when I arrived.  Thanks to Janette for
reminding me of simple pleasures in life.</p>

<p>"Oh look!  That cloud looks like a man painting an image of a
forest with mountains in the background while his kids are playing
baseball in the yard!  Hey, now it's a dog."</p>

<p>Work was hard today, but not ridiculously hard, nor even actually
really hard; I seemed to have been in just a rush to get shit done
slash please Johnny slash impress people with what a good worker I am
slash just get finished so we can go home.</p>

<p>Plus I'm still kinda tired from previous days' work.</p>

<p>I just realized one reason that I meticulously record minute
details in my journal; those details are what triggers my memory to
recall the actual event instead of just reading it as a story, or just
a set of feelings; those don't really help me recall the specific
event, or they haven't in the past.  Or I haven't really tried.</p>

<p>[{(On the way driving to Bossier City with Johnny on Saturday he
suggested that emotions aren't "stored" somewhere until we feel them
so much as they are timeless, or they exist in a timeless space in the
universe.)}]</p>

<p>Anyway, the details for today:  We set up a show at Market Center
or something like that, a huge room with tall white walls with lumps
all over and air vents sticking out quite boldly.</p>

<p>The stage was tricky; a diamond shape pointing at the audience and
on a slight incline so it more fully faces the audience.  This meant
careful arrangement of the legs on the decks for the stage, and they
were color coded but not carefully put in the truck, so it took some
doing to sort them all out.  Plus the slants were subtle so at first
we were putting them on randomly backwards or forwards.</p>

<p>(Right now we're at ZuZu's and the people at the table across from
us are pinching their elbows, marveling at how it doesn't hurt.)</p>

<p>Enough about work.</p>
