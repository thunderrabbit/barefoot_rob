                        <p class=date>6am Tuesday 1 May 2001</p>

<p class=dream>Being held hostage in a jungle, by a man who had a sekeleton in a bamboo cage on the ground, and a new prisoner and me in his hut.  When we arrived, he said that the skelton had been watched witha web cam since 1800 in a cathedral in France or something.</p>

<p class=dream>The skeleton moved, and actually was completely animated, a robotic skelton with metalic bones.  I sat quetly in one corner of the hut faking like a good prisoner, not trying to get away, not scared as the bad guy and the skeleton bantered.  The skeleton secretly hated the bad guy and wanted to kill him, but pretended to enjoy his company.</p>

<p class=dream>The other prisoner was clearly scared and the bad guy was focusing a lot of attention on him in a psychological scary way.  Finally the bad guy walked right up to me and was all staring into my eyes, and I gazed cooly at him, and asked , "como estas?" the familiar version of how are you?  I recognized he was Jim Rose.</p>

<p class=dream>He looked slightly surprised, then "most excellent and then the equivalent of maniacal laughter as he left me alone.  He stepped outside and the skeleton picked up a pick (like for digging in a mine - a big pick) and was going to swing it into the bad guy's back.  The skeleton never did it though, and hid the pick in a suitcase on the ground as the bad guy came back in.</p>

<p class=dream>I said, " notice some koalas in the big tree outside.  He was all, "really?  and ran back out to look.  Sure enough, there were four baby koalas and their mother.  Also heard some monkeys hollering, but I didn't know what kind they were.   I asked the bad gu and he told me.</p>

<p class=dream>I realized it was a dream and I was trying to write it down, but Wende kept talking.  I told her, please, let mejust write this down, but she kept talking even thought she said, "okay."  After several tries, and I could feel te dream slipping away, I started to cry, and she still kept talkng, I realized I was still dreaming.</p>

<p>So I gently woke up for real and wrote this down.</p>

<p>Well, I haven't heard back from the lawyer guy who
apparently needed an expert witness.  Maybe he didn't
need anyone after all.  Maybe he found someone
already.  Maybe it was because I used a handwritten
cover sheet for the fax.</p>

<p>Work is okay; I did a conference call with some
peeps who are selling the G3 to some other peeps, just
figuring out what features to change, etc.</p>

<p>The conference call was from 10am to 11am or so.  I
haven't done much else since then.  Some days I'm an
extreme programmer, some days I'm just chillin'.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>Inside an old haunted house, riding on a skateboard, pulling a wagon with Wende, someone else, and John G from my extended men's group.  I was pulling them along a hallway and then it started to go downhill, and I couldn't see the bottom.  I wanted to go anyway, and pulled toward downhill then coasted coasted quickly faster and faster downhill then stopped, and held them back from sliding downhill with me.  Then a little bouncy ball rolled down the hill and I chased after it.  It reached a bottom, which was like a T intersection.  Doors to the left and to the right.  The ball bounced around in that area as I tried to catch it.  I finally caught it and then tried to climb back up the hill, but Wende and John and them were leaving me, and the doors at the top of the hill were closing.  I was scared of being left alone, then realized it was a dream.  Instead of waking up, I stayed sleeping and poured love over the entire scene, the dream went away and I was still sleeping, then I slowly woke up.</p>

<p>Last week or so I got an email from Targus
soliciting stories about how user's have enjoyed their
collapsable keyboards.  I sent them a copy from my
journal of how my keyboard got run over by a roller
coaster, but still worked for the remainder of our
trip.</p>

<p>In reverse order below is a surprising email
exchange between me and a woman named Rachel who
apparently works for the company looking for the
stories:</p>

<pre>
From:   Rob
To:     Rachel
Date:   30 April 2001

HI Rachel!

Wow!

Wow!  Thank you so so very much!!

The truth is I already bought a new Targus keyboard to
replace the one with a broken hinge and latch.

So that I can write a journal entry on a moment's
notice, I keep the keyboard in my shorts pocket all
the time; the broken latch made the keyboard too bulky
and I just bought a new one to replace it.

I greatly appreciate the offer!

It's hard for me to turn down a free keyboard, but it
seems like the right thing to do in this case.

I'd love to hear back about the
story-acceptance-status; call me if you have any
questions!

    - Rob

<p>I actually just called Rachel; I was so excited
about the offer, etc.  She wondered if I knew anyone I
could give the keyboard to...  so I guess I'll accept
the free one!  I currently do *not* know if I know
anyone who would like the keyboard, but I may offer it
to Steve from Ultimate who I've voted
most-likely-to-buy-a-keyboard-after-seeing-mine.</p>

<p>Or I'll give it to someone in YRUU.  Who knows. 
Let me know if you desperately need it!</p>

<p>Dude called me.  "Yo.  I wonder if you can help out
a buddy o' mine."</p>

<p>"Maybe."</p>

<p>"He needs an <em>expert witness</em> to testify in
court on a case he is on."</p>

<p>"yeah?"</p>

<p>"Yeah.  It would kinda be a volunteer thing,
because you could only charge two hundred fifty
dollars per hour."</p>

<p>"Well forget it then," I joked, almost choked.</p>

<p>"Ha ha.  Yeah."</p>

<p>etc.</p>

<p>- - -</p>

<p>So I called his friend, but it was actually for a
friend of <em>his</em> who is the lawyer in this case.
 I faxed my resume' including my computer skillz to
the lawyer guy.  We'll see what happens.  Tomorrow is
the day that he has to give the name of who his expert
witness will be <em>if</em> an expert witness is
needed.</p>

<p>So I'm not billing $250/hour yet.  I'll let you
know!</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p></p>

<p>early dream:</p>

<p class=dream>While flying, there were four blimp like things - four
floats, not floats, but the big balloons used at parades.  a blimp, a
santa clause, an easter rabbit, and a something else.  It was
commented that this was a rare opportunity to see four such flying
things that normally didn't fly during the same season.</p>

<p>5am dream:</p>

<p class=dream>Walking in Hollywood, with sirens sounding nearby, I
was barefoot, and Fred was on my shouders.  He was pretty young, like
3 or 4 because when he got on, he didn't know exactly the best way to
hold on.  We got to some trees and he had to duck to not be hit; I
told him duck, and it took him a second to figure out what I meant.</p>

<p class=dream>We crossed a street while I could hear the siren,; I
looked for an emergency vehicle of some kind, but saw none.  We got
across the stret and were under some trees, so Fred had to duck.  He
ducked down and then I walked down the hill under the trees on the
sidewalk.  At the bottom of the hill was a slide type thing and I knew
it was a dream, so we slid down the sidewalk and arrived safely with
Fred still sitting on my shoulders.</p>

<p>(^^^^^ this is the time the game started)</p>

<p>Instead of ultimate, a few of us played disc golf
at UH tonight.  Katy, I thought of you as I kept score
on my Handspring Visor.</p>

<p>Jerry was late; he walked the course backwards
until he found us just after our tee off to Sandy In
Defined Space.</p>

<p>AV Springfield is the name Marcel and I gave to the
air vent beside the power plant.  We named it after
the Simpsons' hometown because of the power plant.</p>

<p>(*) Jerry explained that he would have gotten 2 on
the first 10 holes had he been there.</p>

<p>Will lost his disc on top of the Old Science
Building, next to PGH in Entrance 14.  We went inside,
looking for a way to reach the roof, but found only
locked doors.  We waited while Will ran to his car and
back to get a new disc.</p>

<p>Jerry made an incredible putt across the water to
make a resounding thunk on the fountain-structure
thing.  Very nice.</p>

<p>Will made an incredible putt from the hedge under
the tree to the Eternal Flame.  Wow.</p>

<p>We finished the game around 1:30 am, talked in the
parking lot until about 1:50am.  I flipped a disc on
the way home to see if I would come to work tonight to
put this entry online.  The disc was heads, and this
is the entry.</p>

<p class=date>6:14am CDT Friday 27 April 2001</p>
<p class=note>(dream)</p></p>

<p class=dream>At SWUUSI, Christina was there and she was not all
angry and pissy about having missed Plano Rally, like I fear she
might.  I was walking among the youth who were laying in various
puppy-piles on the floor and under a bed.  The one under a bed turned
out to be just one youth with a lot of blankets all over the
place.</p>

<p class=dream>Laura let me listen to a new song that she found on CD.
I was listening to it and asked her to tell me if someone wanted to
talk to me, as I couldn't hear anything else but the song.</p>

<p class=dream>Walking along the edge of the road, I could see tons of
youth all in the trees, climbing, talking, hanging out. It seemed like
I had some sort of X-ray vision because I could see everyone.  Very
odd.</p>
