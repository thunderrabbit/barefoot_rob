<p>Taught 裕子 how to say "HI Miss Llama; I've heard a lot about
  you."  Money.</p>

<p>Told  裕子 about Silent Football (briefed her on the concept of no
  actual football and the two offensive moves) as we took the Tokaido
  line from 川崎 to 東京... but then...</p>

<p class=date>12:09pm</p>

<p>We got way lost, well maybe not way lost, but got on the 山の手
  line the wrong direction and Yuuko was like, "we are going to
  Shinagawa," which is exactly where we had been before so we checked
  the map and jumped off the train and back on the other direction and
  we got a little lost in Tokyo station, trying to get on the Sobu
  line but Yuuko was like, "this ain't quite right, jack" and she
  asked a station guy and we got on the Chuo line and made it here
  basically promptly.</p>

<p class=date>5:20pm</p>

<p>I keep getting interrupted; most recently by a visit with Karen for
  some hours as we ate, rode the roller coasters and generally had a
  grand time gossiping here in Tokyo Dome City.  She's the (unpaid)
  executive coordinator for a <a href="https://www.portlandart.org">fly
  art zoo</a> in Portland.</p>

<p>Yuuko got sick-ish on the indoor rollercoaster and didn't ride the
  next two things, but she did ride the subsequent everythings,
  including the Pocari Sweat sponsored Wonder Drop; we sat both in the
  back the first time then both in the front the second time.  got a
  little ビショビショ but it was still fun.  Then watched a guy do
  mostly a talk performance, but ultimately he rode a giraffe unicycle
  and juggled, including some oddly shaped knives and an apple.  Good
  stuff, but more showmanship than physical performance.</p>

<p>Now we've just eaten in Cafe Danmark. おいしい。</p>

<p class=date>10:38pm JST Wednesday 31 December 2003</p>

<p>Um.  Long train ride to hakkeijima sea paradise.  Long wait in line
  to ride Surf Coaster.  Special thanks to the hitos who waited for us
  20 feet worth of line while I tried to but free passes.  Special
  unthanks to the machine for not having free passes available.  I'm
  trying (wtf (*) that means) to get over having paid 1000 yen for the
  ticket and THEN buying a free pass.  Grr.  But oh well.</p>

<p>(*)whatEVER </p>

<p>Having fun with 裕子.</p>

<p class=date>1:28am JST Thursday 1 January 2004</p>

<p>I'll probably put up a (I've forgotten the word) page of pictures
  for the aquarium that's in 八景島シーパラダイス (Hakkeijima Sea
  Paradise); they've got some pretty fly aquatic animals and an
  annoying number of girls going "kawaiiiii" (cute) fucking over and
  over at every little thing the animals do or are.</p>

<p>裕子 and I are running out of energy, which I predicted in half of
  my mind when I was like, "welp, I'll bah me a all day pass ifins
  it'll be good fer alla tomorra, but ifin it's only good fer tonight,
  you ken fergit it."  or something like that.</p>

<p>We're sitting on the floor in the aqua museum beneath a sign that
says "no sleeping."</p>

<p>I'm hungry.</p>

<p class=date>5:46am JST Thursday 1 January 2004</p>

<p>We're now leaving Hakkeijima Sea Paradise.  Rode Surf Coaster four
  times, which isn't as many times as I rode it when I came with Liz
  on the rainy day, BUT we spent much more time at the coaster
  considering the line averaged over one hour per ride.  Eeeek.</p>

<p>We also rode the tall as drop tower and...  oh man that's all we
  did.  The lines were way long.  But, well, we scoped the fish and
  other quatic life in the aquarium which took plenty of time.</p>

<p>I can tell I'm tired since I'm not typing all that fast.   Maybe
  1/2 speed.</p>

<p>fuck I'm tired.</p>

<p>I taught 裕子 the phrase "it's fuckin' cold."</p>

<p>janette sent me an email to my phone right at new years.  Timing
  was perfect, for I was able to reply "TANKSMATE!" and still get to
  the appointed fireworks viewing site 9 seconds before the
  anticipated moment.</p>

<p>Nice timing.</p>

<p>I'll get to see janette soooooon!</p>

<p>I kissed Yuuko (no tongue) a few times. On different occassions
  throughout our time together "tonight."  Most recently on the train
  platform in Shin-something station (the end of the seaside line),
  she was on my lap with our cheeks touching close close and then she
  said, "big kiss" and I was like, "mm?" and she goes, "big kiss" and
  we mashed lips together, and it must have felt pretty good cause we
  did it again immediately.</p>

<p>She was like, "haha two big kisses."</p>

<p>I wouldn't call them big kisses, but they were definitely kisses.</p>

<p>The previous (first) time was while waiting in line for the third
  riding of Surf Coaster.  I was spooned behind her with my hands with
  her hands in her jacket pockets and I took a big bite on both of her
  ears and then cheeks close together and then, somewhat awkwardly,
  our first kiss.  Then another, almost as awkward.  I was like,
  "sorry," and "I shouldn't kiss you," and she was like, "it's
  okay."</p>

<p>Really tired.  Fell asleep on each train home.  Yuuko didn't, so I
  didn't miss any stations on the way to Yokohama.  I had to watch for
  Tsunashima by myself, and I was successful.  Nice.  Oh shit I almost
  just fell asleep before I wrote nice; I was thinking about having to
  stay awake for the train and fell asleep thinking about staying
  awake.  Weird enough.</p>

<p>Okay, Happy New Year and good night.</p>

<p>For some reason my phone is locked and the code to unlock it is
  not the code it used to be.  I don't know how it got locked; the
  phone was not turned off (I didn't turn it on when I found it
  locked) blah blah blah.  So I'll go to vodafone to get it unlocked;
  I hope they are open today!</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Yay.  They were open.  Got the number recovered; it was 3873.  I
  thought it was 3673.  Hmmm.  I don't usually forget such things.</p>

<p>I've started working on a new painting.  Really happy about that.
  Interesting is that Dan saw it when I only had green on the canvas
  and he asked if it was done, which makes me think that ... hmm; it
  could be done with just one color.</p>

<p>Nah.</p>

<p>裕子 and I met at Starbucks in Cinecitta and then zoomed over to
  Shibuya to sit in Harajuku for a bit.  Watched the bicycle guys, but
  they weren't as good as the time janette and I watched that one cat
  a long time ago.</p>

<p>Walked down おもてさんどう street, which I've been down before, but
  didn't know the name of it.  Found a subway and headed toward Tokyo
  station to check out ミレナリオ (mirenario) a big light show thing
  that is pretty anticlimatic, but is basically pretty.  Not quite as
  good vibes as the lights on West Gray, but still pretty good.  What
  was REALLY amazing though was the Japanese crowds packed so tightly
  that we couldn't really walk with full steps and couldn't easily
  walk side by side; we kept getting mushed by the crowd.  Tens of
  thousands of people crowded these few blocks and thousands all had
  their camera phones in the air, taking little piece of crap pictures
  to basically just, I dunno; prove that they had been there, but not
  only to someone who knew what they were looking at.</p>

<p>Insanity.</p>

<p>And cold, so we came to a Starbucks here in this rather fancy
  shmancy district.  Does Starbucks have a frequent flyer card?  Not a
  debit card, but a free stuff after multi purchase card.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>We walked around Roppongi (my first time to be there), the
  expensive night-lifeful area that I thought would have a lot of
  drunken revelry, but was pretty chill and beautiful.  The most
  awesome fun thing was sitting on a glass chair <! and Yuuko sitting
  in my lap> reading the somewhat random numbers that were being
  displayed on a wall.  Three large digits that would each
  independently count from 9 down to 1 and then blank (which I used as
  a zero) and I would pronounce the number in Japanese each time a
  digit changed.</p>

<p>Fun fun stuff.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Rode my bike home in 30 minutes.  Cold cold cold.  Home around
  11:30, bed around 12:30.</p>

  and trusting that my (*) resulting happiness will attract to me
  beautiful people and energy and wealth and a positive life.  So I'm
  letting go here and going out into the world. (**)</p>

<p>(*) At this point in my entry, 裕子 invited me to see MIRENARIO
  tonight, a beautiful light display that I've wanted to see.  Oh, but
  I'm meeting ゆみ tonight at 7.  Hmmm. (***)</p>

<p>(**) here = Carla's house, the world = The Apple Store in Ginza.</p>

<p>(***) we've decided to go see it tomorrow night.</p>

<br>Im not sure if you remember me, Im Karen P, that spastic yruu-er from Austin- was on YAC for a bit.  Well the other day I ran into some old yruu frinds randomly in Olympia WA where I had been living for a couple of years.  Well they were catching me up on what everyone has been up to and said you were in Japan.  I check your journal thing for the first time in years today, and by golly it seems that you are in Japan. Whats funny about that is that I am currently in Japan as well, kasuga in fact (by the tokyo dome).  Just for a bit visiting someone.  But anyways it would be nice to maybe have lunch or something.</p>

<p>Nice.  I'm at the Apple store in Ginza and the guy showed me how
  to get my funny deer movie saved correctly.  User error.</p>

<p>Now I have a new battery and a new power supply, all thanks to my
  AppleCare warranty.  Sweet.</p>

<p>Trying to set up a new email list for Rob in Japan updates.  Sent
  out a few test messages to janette and Fred, but I can't figure out
  how new subscribers can find the list or how they subscribe.  The
  ezmlm.org site seems to be down.  Bluh.</p>
