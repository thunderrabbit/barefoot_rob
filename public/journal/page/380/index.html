                        <p class=date>12:07pm CST Wednesday 26 March 2003</p>

<p>Now I'm in LAX (interesting how I won't often abbreviate Los
Angeles, but think nothing of using LAX).</p>

<p>Oh, but now I'm in PST...</p>

<p class=date>10:09am PST Wednesday 26 March 2003</p>

<p>I've got 1 hour and 1 minute until my flight to Narita.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Notable:</p>

<p>(!) I basically slept hard core sleepin' during the flight.
Did not notice beverage service, not that I wanted to; I'm shifting
myself to Japanese timezone.</p>

<p>(@) Woke up near the end of the flight and requested orange juice
from any of the three flight attendants who were all chatting it up on
this 1/3 full flight.  1/4 full?  Since the plane was so empty when I
boarded, I just cruised to the back for sleep purposes; I figured most
people would be in a hurry to get off first and would crowd toward the
front.  (Seems I was right).  They joked "oh <em>now</em> you want
something after we've been up and down the aisles twenty times!"</p>

<p>"Well, yeah, I like to be original."</p>

<p>"Mmmm," she agreed, "that's one way to say it."</p>

<p>I was all, "oh, 'Pain In The Ass' is the one you were thinking of"
hahahha</p>

<p>And I got orange juice (with no ice!  and I didn't even have to
request it) and little snack bag.</p>

<p>(#) I expressed profound thanks and initiated conversation, "I'm
going to Japan to teach English!" and gave all three my adventure
card.  They asked about it: what city, what Japanese do you know, what
did you do before, oh how excellent an adventure it will be.  ...  So
great.  I'm so much more excited and happy than all crying when I
arrived at DFW.</p>

<p>One of the three asked why I chose Japan and asked what other
countries I've visited, specifically non-English speaking.  Later she
mentioned that she's toyed with the idea of teaching English somewhere
given layoffs on United (presumably resulting from Airplane Day and
the Let's Attack Iraq program).</p>

<p>($) The landing was remarkably smooth!  Smoother than highway
driving.  Seriously!  It was quite amazing, and a sharp (smooth?)
contrast to the FO ex-Navy pilot landing on Southwest Airlines into
Austin.</p>

<p>I commented on this and it was suggested (by the attendant who
spoke with me most) that this airplane tends to be smoother than 737s.
Hmmm.  This was a "AIRBUS INDUSTRIE - SPECIAL VERSION" according to
the itenerary I received.</p>

<p>I told the captain what an amazing landing it was.  "Much smoother
than the Navy guy who landed my most recent flight, though that was a
lot of fun, too."</p>

<p>"Well, sometimes that happens too," he said.  I wonder if he was
giving a blanket reason for possible hard landings, or if he thought
maybe I was just guessing it was a ex-Navy FO.</p>

<p class=date>10:29am</p>

<p>People are crowding around the gate for my flight.  Maybe it's time
to move.</p>

<p>An official looking woman stood near the entry of the plane on the
jetway.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" I ask, trying to appear optimistically
curious rather than WTF??? like that.</p>

<p>She goes, "I'm escorting somebody."</p>

<p>"Ah.  You look very official.."</p>

<p>"I <em>am</em> very official," she assured me.</p>

<p>"Anyone I've heard of?"  I asked, <em>obviously</em> referring to
whom she may be escorting.</p>

<p>"INS," like that was the end all answer to all conversations about
<em>anything</em> official.</p>

<p>"Ah," (no no who are you escoring?  Nevermind, it mustn't be anyone
famous.) I boarded the plane.</p>

<p>Seat 48K, the finest gold <em>ever</em>.</p>

<p>I'll switch to Tokyo time and see how it comes up.</p>

<p class=date>4:45am JST Thursday 27 March 2003</p>

<p>Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeird.  How did we lose 5 minutes?  A postcard to
first person who emails me a URL explaining it.</p>

<p class=date>11:48am PST Wednesday 26 March 2003</p>

<p>Okay.  This is fo sheezy jacked up.  I changed back to PST and lost
an hour.</p>

<p class=date>4:49am JST Thursday 27 March 2003</p>

<p class=date>11:51am PST Wednesday 26 March 2003</p>

<p class=date>4:52am JST Thursday 27 March 2003</p>

<p>Well at least it's not losing an hour each time I switch back and
forth.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I've met the guy beside me; we actually have an empty seat between
us.  He's Japanese with good English and works in the water
purification business.</p>

<p>When I told him he speaks English well, he denied this, saying he
was ashamed of his skills.  Hmmm different culture fo sheezy.</p>

<p>He said married like "mahleed" and I couldn't understand him at
first.  (furthering his shame, dammit).  gotta rememeber that these
cats don't have the R sound in their what's-the-word phonetic
structure? set of phonomes?  pheremones? hahaah</p>

<p>Okay enough wasting battery.  OH!  That reminds me, super thanks to
Mac for making my power adapter work in Japan too.</p>

<p class=date>5:35am JST</p>

<p>Woah.  Looking down at the ocean, I can see our shadow, and the
shadow of our con-trail behind the plane!  This is the first direct
evidence I've seen indicating that I'm in such an aircraft!</p>

<p class=date>9:41am JST Thursday 27 March 2003</p>

<p>Okay.  I'm awake for the day.  We've got apparently 6+ more hours
on the flight which seems surprising; I feel like I've slept more than
4 hours.  Oh well; whatever.  There; I'm done being jet lagged.</p>

<p class=date>10:36am</p>

<p>D'oh.</p>

<p>I'm dumb.  I never read the 3 newsletters sent to me by Nova.  The
second newsletter asks me to do some homework designed to help me
learn how to teach super detailed forms of speech in English.  The
answers are given in newsletter 1.  I brought number 2 only; I don't
seem to have number 3 at all.  I doubt they'll fire me, but this is
not necessarily the 100% best way to start.  Oh well.</p>

<p class=date>1:01pm</p>

<p>Less than 3 hours until we land.  Alrighh.</p>

<p>Just watched a basically boring movie depicting differences between
monetary success and integrity of character.</p>

<p>But the movie did confirm my resolve not to fib about not reading
the newsletters.</p>

<p>I've just converted ~ $610 to 68000 yen.  Almost enough for one
month's rent.  Nice.  There are a lot of zeros on each bill.  I have
some 10,000 yen bills now.  Five such bills I think.</p>

<p>Hoping Janette makes it home soon so she can join me to the
Galleria to get more $ exchanged. I coulda gotten there myself, but
she wanted to go too.</p>

<p class=date>5:29pm</p>

<p>Did it.  The Galleria location had 70,000 yen.  Maybe next time
I'll plan ahead more and make fewer transactions, costing less
money.</p>

<p>Two funny things today: one just now.</p>

<p>Earlier:</p>

<p>Janette was all, "I'm hungry.  Maybe we can order Chinese take-out.
Do you like Chinese food?"</p>

<p>Me:  "yeah!  why do you think I'm going to... <em>*OH SHIT!*</em>"</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Just now Janette was helping me pack.  Out of the closet, she got
my suit and shoes, the ones that I bought for several dollars in
California.  She opened the shoebox and saw each shoe in its own cloth
sack thing.</p>

<p>&lt;gasp!>, she gasped, "Shhh, they're <em>sleeping</em>!"</p>

<p>Okay.  I've archived junk from my old wallet, purchased everything
I think I'll need, archived my 2002 taxes (sent them in today via
turbotax.com ($19.95)), printed my flight info, my arrival info,...
now it's time to pack.  But first I need to unpack the boxes and bags
that have accumulated here at Janette's while I've been here.</p>

<p>She's hemming my pants while I do that.  I can do it.  On my mark,
get set... go!</p>

<p class=date>11:59pm</p>

<p>Done unleashing all the boxes; starting to pack now, but first I'm
going to call or email Colleen for her birthday.  Sooo tired I'm
becoming.</p>

<p class=date>2:52am</p>

<p>Now I've finished my garment bag and nearly finished the suitcase.  So far I've packed:</p>

<p>11 pair dark socks
10 pair light socks
10 ties
9 slacks
9 undies
8 long sleeve shirts
4 belts
1 suit: pants, coat
1 pair boat shoes
1 pair hard black shoes
1 pair slippers
1 pair soft black shoes
1 rain jacket
1 GAP hoodie</p>

<p class=date>4:19am</p>

<p>So close, but I can't find my passport.  I had it just a while ago.</p>

<p class=date>4:33am</p>

<p>Ah.  I put it in the pocket of the pants I intend to wear tomorrow.</p>

<p class=date>4:45am</p>

<p>Finished packing for the night.  Gotta be at the airport in 2 hours.</p>

<p>Gonna send out a mass email.</p>

<p class=date>5:12am</p>

<p>And by mass email, I meant email to Josephine about Scott.  Okay,
now mass email.  God I'm so tired.</p>

<p class=date>5:34am</p>

<p>Sent.  I'm going to upload these journal entries, pack up my
computer, sleep maybe.  Maybe not.  I dunno that I really have time.
Thankfully Janette has been sleeping; she'll take me to the airport.</p>

<p>Whooo!  Just got a call from Swa'vet who I met at Kinko's while she
helped produce <em>Dirty Third II</em> back in like May or so.  Wow!!
So great to talk to her again and she might come see me in Japan in
like November or so!  How awesome would that be!</p>

<p>She's worked on two more movies, one similar to "Ghost" and one
called <em>Panther</em> about a female super hero.  I don't remember
much more than that.</p>

<p>I told Swa'vet the story of me meeting her and Juni and Greg and
Steve at Kinko's and then me and Fred seeing her et. al. about a week
later when she cracked me and Fred up, "stop fuckin' around and call
me tomorrow!"</p>

<p>Didn't tell her the part about meeting Wissam and oh man I forgot
his name and he was the one who wrote me back!  Something with a C.</p>

<p class=date>11:46pm</p>

<p>Back to packing!</p>

<p>I'm going to see my mom in Waco (1.5 hours away) today!  And...  oh
she's bringing me some ties (I hope she got the message; I archived
some ties with her when I began my homeless life) and I bought a few
ties at Ross.</p>

<p>Oh and I gotta pack!  And get dollars changed to yen.  Lotsa
dollars!!  Lots more yen!!!</p>

<p>But..... I don't leave until Wednesday...</p>

<p>Aw yeah..  I've got plenty of time.</p>

<p class=date>12:18pm</p>

<p>See?  I'm already in the restaurant 45 minutes early.  I like being
early, but I don't necessarily need to be *this* early to be happy.
Maybe 10 minutes.  But hey, plenty of time to write.  Maybe I'll
compose my first mass email that I plan to send.</p>

<p>Weeeeeeeeird.</p>

<p>I am exactly 99.9% certain I'm at the right restaurant.  The
directions include:</p>

<ol><li>go to Waco (did that)</li>
<li>exit Lake Shore drive which might be exit 340 (I exited Lake Shore
drive which is exit 341 but highway 340 is at that intersection)</li>
<li>go east (did that)</li>
<li>find a Mexican restaurant close to the freeway called El Capitan
or something. (I found a Mexican restaurant close to the freeway
called el Conquistador; I think that's close enough.  Starts with "El
C," has a vaguely similar conotation, Captain is more common a word in
English that Conquistador, and she said "or something")</li>
</ol>

<p>But ma is not here.  She's not normally late for things that I know
of.</p>

<p>I tried to call her cell phone, but the pay phone won't let me dial
it.  I tried the operator, and she got the same "number is
disconnected signal".  I tried not dialing 1.  (It said dial 1)  I
tried three different numbers in Austin.  I tried Janette's number in
Dallas.  All go to the same "number is disconnected" after I dial
1+area+prefix.  I don't even get to the last four numbers.</p>

<p>I went to a different payphone in a different building.  Same
thing.  I'm going to ask around to see if I can borrow a cell phone
from someone.</p>

<p class=date>1:56pm</p>

<p>Short story: I couldn't call collect to ma's cell phone.  Tried
three different carriers.  No one was home at Janette's (I tried to
call collect her phone).  I dialed 0 and they couldn't help.  Dialed
00 and they couldn't help.</p>

<p>I dialed the number listed <em>on the phone</em> "call if you
have problems or complaints," and <em>they don't service this
phone!!!</em></p>

<p>I tried 0 to find out who I complain to but she didn't know, or
maybe something else.</p>

<p>I was so boiling with frustration I was dialing 0, preparing to say
calmly, "I am literally going to destroy this phone if you do not get
me connected to this number now.  I will destroy it and walk away and
it will be a hella lot more expensive to you guys than making this
simple phone call."</p>

<p>So great to hug my mom after all that.</p>
