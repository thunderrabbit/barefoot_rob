                        <p><p>1998 San Antonio rally review by Annie Bricker</p>

<hr>

<p><p><pre></p>

<p>Damn, over a hundred people going to your average rally and not one of
them has written a review since OKC 98.  That&rsquo;s terrible people!<br />
anyway, got back from the San An Rally yesterday so I am going to write
about it before the memories begin to fade.  And yes, contrary to
popular belief, i do more at rallies than just stay with Nick Carter.<br />
The trip to San An was alright, if not long.  We stopped at a McDonalds
on the way where i saw Eryn Pope order the first vegetarian
cheese-burger i have ever seen.  Amazingly enough the cashier didn&rsquo;t
give any strange looks or anything.  We drove through San Marcos Texas
for some reason along the way although i am almost positive that it is
really really not on the way from OKC to San Antonio.  We were softly
serenaded by the melodious rhythms of SCOTT&hellip;.(hey you, fuck you).  And
speaking of scotts, where was Scotty H. and for that matter Paul M.?<br />
Anyway, we got there and piled out of the van (of course i jumped out
and on to those really fucking hard rocks in the parking lot of the San
An church) and did our various registration things.  Which, by the way,
included getting your name written on your arm in red marker, something
which, i thought, was a really good idea, so if you have forgotten
someone&rsquo;s name since the last time you saw them and you don&rsquo;t want to
make a complete ass of yourself, you can just quickly glance down at
their arm. So Jo-Jo registered us and someone i forgot whom (sorry to
that person/people) took our individual pictures with this really cool
looking digital camera and we got our t-shirts.  which were pretty cool
with all the shrooms and the slug with the hook.  So, we had come a bit
late, but just in time for opening circle.  And damn, i remember being
there, but all i can remember is that they announced the touch groups
and i forgot whose i was in and had to go searching around for the
group.  I finally found them by the trees in the play ground.  We didn&rsquo;t
do any of the touch group games, cause hell, lets be honest, there are
better things to at a rally than play a game called &ldquo;Knock Your Socks
Off&rdquo; with a group of mostly barefooted people.  Lauren told us that our
jobs were lunch clean up and bathroom clean up (sounds great huh,) and
then we slowly dissipated into the collective smoke break group forming
by the basket ball courts.  Around 4 am i found my self laying in a pile
of Christina, Dane, John and some other people.  All this was well and
good, however, now that i have slept a bit, i don&rsquo;t really remember how
I got there.  Anyway, at this point some people decided to take the big
metal bar dome type thing whose name i don%27t know, and put it over
Eric.  this happened (with a bit of stepping over sean) and about ten
people climbed on top so when eric woke up he was surrounded by a dome
of people.  Rob was ready with the camera when Eric woke up with a
bewildered &ldquo;What the fuck&rdquo; kind of look on his face.  There was pancakes
and sausage for breakfast that i skipped for some reason, though i
don%27t recall why.  I laid in the grass and listened to Lauren M play
the guitar, I listened to Evan, well, talk and watched a basketball
game.  Smoke breaks came and went.  Nick and i found the rally book and
he drew in it and then wrote the rules for the game that is more complex
than Silent Football that he and i invented called &ldquo;I Once Saw this
Woman on Jerry Springer&hellip;&rdquo;  for rules, check out the gray rally book.<br />
The mandatory smoke workshop came, even though the guy who was supposed
to talk to us from the Cancer Society didn&rsquo;t.  I thought it worked out
for the better though, cause wouldn&rsquo;t you rather talk to people you know
about smoking than have some guy you have never met come tell you stuff
that you have heard before and will hear again in any highschool health
class you ever attend?  Anyway, that went okay and then a miracle
occurred: I found an empty couch on which to sleep!  I was only meaning
to sleep for a short period of time but when i woke up and asked someone
what time it was I realized i had been asleep for 5 hours.  So, sorry,
Bryan, i really did mean to go to your workshop.  So i woke up and went
to the playground and listened to more guitar.  then lauren announced
that her dream workshop was about to start and i went to that.  It was
pretty cool, the books and stuff and Lauren did a great job.  At some
point after that i went into the Fellowship room and read some of
someone&rsquo;s poetry and realize &ldquo;oh shit, they are playing Michael Jackson,
someone change it quick&rdquo;.  then dinner&hellip;.and DAMN! that vegetarian
lasagne was good.  Had some really watered down lemonade, but that was
alright.  then a touch group meeting was announced and we all met, then
realised it was really a touch group leader meeting and not really a
touch group meeting.  But that was alright.  i danced a bit with Bryn to
some really odd sounding R&amp;B music and then washed my hair in a sink
(yay for short hair, you can wash it anywhere!)  Damn, I am babbling, i
will get to the interesting parts.  worship.  it was pretty damn cool
with everybody hugging everybody, and there are some good huggers out
there, you know who you are, and lauren on the guitar.  Talent show,
damn was that funny.  Even though Kris broke a guitar.  Andrew juggled,
Rob was &ldquo;made-up pretty&rdquo;, Rob and Nick ate boxes of Nerds, Bryan read
poetry (M-U-R-D-E-R-amen to that) Robert played the piano, many people
played the guitar, a story was told, and i think i fell asleep for
parts, but a generally managed to stay kind of conscious.  We began to
be swept away by hurricane-like weather so i ended up sleeping inside by
the kitchen.   It was still raining in the morning so we didn&rsquo;t get to
burn the shroom like we were going to but hell, it is all metaphorical
anyway.  Breakfast was doughnuts, how familiar:)  i finally got to write
in the rally book, and read Bryns thing about &lsquo;non-sleep&rsquo; vs sleep.<br />
closing circle,  the beaver song, the walrus song (really, a beaver is
not a sea faring animal like a walrus is, it was just a funny intro) the
banana song, senior circle (bish kinda got messed up but it worked) and
the yackty yaks and mug books were given out (btw, that camera has some
fucking good quality) and then we all had to leave.  the ride home was
alright, but crowded as shit.  And there you have it, a really long
winded rally review.  and you can do one too.  really, it is easy.  i
didn&rsquo;t even break a nail.

<hr>

<p><p><pre></p>

<p>so i got inspired</p>

<p>leaving school on friday was a pain in the ass, but katie and danny k and
i got through it. (don&rsquo;t get confused, danny k was just visiting, he
doesn&rsquo;t go to my school) there was some craziness getting everyone
together and into the van, but we(me, katie carson, danny k, ian coward,
and matt luria, and me momma) finally left tulsa at about 4:00 in the
nippy grayness of afternoon. we got a little lost, and someone who will
go unnamed kept making references to the idea that i was a really bad
navigator, which made me really mad mad mad, but then there was almost
constant silliness with me and katie and ian and danny k, so it all
evened out. so&hellip;&hellip;.we got to the rally at about 3:30 and got ourselves
registered. i got hugs from all sorts of crazy loved peoples, poking a
more than a few in the eye with my wings in the process.heehe. my memory
is failing me&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;oh! this is making me mad!! oh- when i first got
there maia handed me this really neat book of stuff that she made. it was
really cool. and jeremy loomis-norris was there in his suave outfit bein&rsquo;
all scary and suave.then later nathan ryan and katie carson and i were
gonna watch the sunrise but something happened and we didn&rsquo;t, i think we
went inside because katie was cold. and then it was saturday morning and
i was outside with the smokers and i was on my way to brush my teeth, but
ben atkinson got me all sidetracked with this really scary little cap gun
thing. i finally escaped :) and got my teeth brushed (which is so much
harder to do at a rally than it should be) and went to do the breakfast
thing. i had some good pancakes and some cooked pig. mmmm&hellip;&hellip;.yum! and
some really wacky sunny d that was like mucus, so i didn&rsquo;t drink it.
hhhmmmmm&hellip;&hellip;..more&hellip;more&hellip;more&hellip;..look! mush for you! i remember
sitting somewhere kinda by myself and being really happy &lsquo;cause this was
my third san an and i have grown so much since then and rallies have made
all the diference in the world. yeah. oh- jeremy made me listen to this
band guster that i really liked and so i was doing some nancy dancing
with jeremy and that was good. and lunch happened somewhere in there and
it was the usual nasty sandwiches and chips that i really wish someone
would break the cycle of (hint hint). and i sat at a table and listened
to some people, i remember nathan ryan and elizabeth severance but
everyone else is kinda blurry, and people were being funny and i laughed.
there was more fun and love and silliness in this space here. and then
there was dinner and i joined a new &ldquo;club&rdquo;.heehe. and somewhere before
that ben atkinson wrestled me to the ground and phuufed me for the first
time!! i was soo mad. i was planning on maintaining my non-phuufed status
for at least another year, at least. and at worship we did a hug circle,
and people were talking and laughing and i thought that was so much
better than those hug circles we do sometimes that you can&rsquo;t really talk
or giggle at because we&rsquo;re being &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; (i think this
spiritual=quiet and contemplative is a crock of shit-excuse my
french-cause you can be very spiritual laughing until your tummy hurts)oh
well. hmmm&hellip;.more&hellip;&hellip;..the talent show was kinda scary but
interesting.steve sang rocky raccoon, which i love cause it has my name
in it :). and there was this one part with rob and my mom and make-up,
and that was scary, because within the course of it my mother was rubbing
on rob&rsquo;s chest, and man, that&rsquo;s just plain bad weird. (sorry rob, it was
my mother. ahhh!!! )and then aaron and kris did their usual oh so cute
round of songs, this time complete with &ldquo;dancing&rdquo;. i don&rsquo;t think you get
cuter than that. and lauren dodski and ellen smith sang american pie and
it made me all happy and sad and it was wonderful. and a while after that
i went to sleep. alone. in a cold room. woke up 40 min. later and found a
blanket and a pillow(someone was using my pillow and sleeping bag) and
fell asleep in the sanctuary. next thing i know shirah&rsquo;s waking me up and
there&rsquo;s clean up (how that sanctuary got clean was purely a miracle) and
donuts and closing circle and that happy sadness you get on the sunday
morn of a rally. and then there were many hugs and we got in the van and
went home. or at least back to tulsa. :)</p>

<p>love and cuteness and hugs for all of you

                        <p><title>San Antonio Rally</title></p>

<p class=date>2 November 1998</p>

<p>Here is my version of this past weekend lock-in at San Antonio with 120+ youth and a ton of fun!

<p>Here are <a href="/images/YRUU/san_antonio_1998">pics from the rally</a>.

<p><hr>

<p>How incredible to think that just counting from memory, we brought more than 25 youth from Houston!  Yay! This whole Houston Network thing is working wonderfully!

<p>Youth from Emerson church collected at Emerson and waited for youth from First Church to arrive.  They had a 15 passenger van, and we had a 7 passenger..  4 advisors and 17 youth and we were on our way!

<p>We stopped more than I wanted, but got there plenty early considering how short the drive is.

<p>Bing!! We were at the rally! and I stayed up the first night until 8am!  I usually crash by like 5 or 6am for a couple of hours.  During the night I remembered or re-learned names of many youth..  It took forever to remember Joanna's but I finally did and let her know I remember by signing it out to her during opening circle. (Thanks Kathryn for teaching me the alphabet!)  I remembered Nuha Kadri's all the way back from I think Dallas Rally last year.. and I was sure to remember because she said there is no way I could do it. Ha!

<p>Um, oh one weird thing was the movie <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> it was bizarre stop action animation type stuff that reminded me of a Frank Black movie I saw some time ago. I sat and watched the end of that until like 7 am or so when it was just thinking about getting light outside.

<p>I slept from about 8:30am to 10 or so and wondered what was up when a herd of youth rumbled quietly out to the basketball court.
I took pictures as they were climbing up on the dome jungle gym over Eric Morrow.  Funny stuff!  <a href="/images/YRUU/san_antonio_1998/ondome.jpg">Here's a pic</a>.

<p><a href="/images/YRUU/san_antonio_1998/underdome.jpg">Here</a> is Eric.

<p>Soon thereafter, for some reason I cannot explain, Sean (who was sleeping peacefully in the first pic above) and Jason were <a href="/images/YRUU/san_antonio_1998/jasonsean.jpg">wrestling in the grass.</a>

<p>Soon after that, Kris was up in the big tree after being chased by Sean..  I climbed up and got some pics.  <a href="/images/YRUU/san_antonio_1998/intree.jpg">Here's one.</a>

<p>For the next 5 or 6 hours, I was in a YAC meeting. We got a lot done and settled; we're working on getting the YAC PAC complete and making a standard way for rallies to be YAC Approved. Good stuff.

<p>After the YAC meetin' we had dinner of lasagna and I had a big enormous piece of cake. Big. Huge. Lots of icing.  :-)

<p>And then we had YAC elections, fully facilitated by the youth on YAC.  Out of 6 youth who ran, Elizabeth Severance, Adam Lock, and Melissa Cain were elected.

<p>That evening Jason Fricke and I did our <a href="/images/YRUU/san_antonio_1998/back_to_back.jpg">gymnastical stunts</a>
and foolin' around and it developed into a game of keep-away with the big tape ball that resulted in wadding up the tape that had been used to make the life size chess board..  I was in the YAC meeting during all that.  (Someone said it was more like a pillow fight pretending to be a chess game)

<p>I <a href="/images/YRUU/san_antonio_1998/rob_sleepin.jpg">took a nap</a> before the talent show.

<p>Kris Scott and Aaron Ivener performed some songs, and I totally love how they play together..  They have a connection that is wonderful as they work back and forth on stage.  Nevermind.. I can't describe it.

<p>Nick Carter and I each ate a box of Nerds.  One of the boxes that has two flavors. I think it was Grape and Watermelon.
That was quite an ordeal, but we did it!  I stayed onstage the entire time until my entire box was nothing but fiber and I swallowed the whole thing (one little bit at a time)

<p>I'm sure that was more than you wanted to hear..  

<p>Nick played a beautiful, dramatic, (improvised?) piece on the piano while he chewed his box of Nerds.</p>

<p>Also I got my face painted (mostly just a bunch of base, given the <a href="/images/YRUU/san_antonio_1998/makeup.jpg">picture</a>).  That was pretty wacky.  

<p>Oh, and just before that, Kris and I did voices for Jen and Dane for the San Antonio Saki part IV School-A-Saki, which we first did last year. I thought we did quite well; our best one yet!

<p>After the talent show we pulled together a game of Silent Football.  Yay!!

<p>I was nominated Dictator, and Jeremy, Austin, Katie, Adam, Bryn, Bryan, Chris.. man I can't remember all who played.
<br>I was very quick to call "Holy Gihad!" whenever someone even thought about messing with the group.  I called it a bit quickly on Ryan Ray, and I'm sorry about that.
<br>I'm sure there is a happy medium somewhere.

<p>So the game went on for a pretty long time and got wacked out for a while, but after Jeremy excused himself, we had a more serious (as if Silent Football can be serious) game.

<p>What was funny was I started the game with a Surge, and had my pockets stuffed with 4 other Surges. So each time I'd finish one, I open up another.  I had 6 empty in front of me by the end of the game and I HAD TO PEEEEEE!!

<p>Ahem.  So it was a pretty great game, and I pretty much went to bed right after.  My diary says I lay down at 5:40am.

<p>But I didn't sleep.  Finally I found something that kept me awake!  Six cans of Surge!  (and that was after the huge piece of cake and groovy juice (which I didn't even mention)).

<p>I lay in bed for 1 hour, including through most of cleanup, and soon ended up with Jason Fricke trying to get me up. "If I have to be up, you have to be up."   Pfshh.  yeah right.

<p>But I got up and we made some copies of the Houston Rally registration and handed them out at closing circle.

<p>This review is dragging.  We hugged, loaded up in the chilly rain and went to Taco Cabana and went home.</p>

<p><ol>

<p><li>Today begins San Antonio Rally.  From previous experience, I know if I don't write before the rally about stuff that happened before the rally, it probably won't be written</li>

<p><li>This past week, Manda and I saw the movie ORGAZMO, the new Trey Parker film.  There were 5 people in the theater, including us, and we had free passes to get in. It was pretty funny in that Southpark kinda way, but I'm pretty glad I didn't pay for it.</li>

<p><li>That night she spent the night and we spent just about the whole next day in bed.  Okay, maybe the movie did have some merit.</li>

<p><li>D'oh! but I missed an appointment for a general physical exam that I decided to do just to do it before I go to Costa Rica.</li>

<p><li>In the early part of the week, I was feeling pretty crappy in general, unproductive, that kind of thing. Scott (my car) went to the doctor on Tuesday and was feeling better $240 later.</li>

<p><li>I signed the paperwork to get MR Labs advertised on the back of the receipt tape at two Krogers near my house!
A friend of mine pointed out that advertising there would not be his suggestion; he wouldn't look for professional website design on the back of register tape, and I almost didn't do it, but when I thought about it later, it just felt like the right decision.  We'll see what happens.
They don't go out until January 1999.</li>

<p><li>Last night Wende and Eric and I went to see ORGAZMO. We had two free passes, and figured we could pay for 1 between us, but ironically, Eric and I left the pass at my apartment and he just paid for all of us.</li>

<p><li>I've been chatting in the Sauna on <a href="https://www.wbs.net" target="wbs">www.wbs.net</a>, an online chat thing.  My character is Thunder Rabbit, who likes to jump on the trampoline in there and play Chickenball.</li>

<p><li>Matt and Nathan are here chillin' until the rally.  They just came in from New Orleans by bus.</li>

<p><li>Oh! In the latter part of this week, I felt much happier and more productive when I figured out how to do stuff with cookies and forms and JavaScript!  I was able to make a couple of pages that set cookies and remember a user's name and what color they chose.  If you want to see them, <a href="mailto:thunderrabbitATcheerfulDOTcom">ask me</a>, and I'll give you the URL.  (2003 July: they're long gone; don't ask)</li>

<p><li>I spent some time updating the /images directory of the Southwest District YRUU website.  Nothing amazing; I didn't add any content, but just organized the pictures into directories and stuff.</li>

<p><li>Part of me thinks, "wow; what a boring week" but I'm still having fun.</li>

                        <p><title>Halloween Carnival</title></p>

<p class=date>25 October 1998</p>

<p>Today at church we had our annual carnival with proceeds benefitting UNICEF.  The youth group had two tables set up: one for face painting and stuff, and the other for fake blood and bandages.

<p>They also were in charge of the jail; people could pay to have others arrested, and those who were arrested could pay to get out.

<p>At one point I was arrested "for being bald" and I walked calmly over to the jail then scampered off, with some of the youth after me. They can't arrest me!!!

<p>I ran out of the area, and jumped the chain link fence around the playground (what a good example I'm setting!) and ran around the entire church with 3 youth behind me.  My ankle was a bit sore (I hurt it last night jumping over Maggie's couch) so I couldn't run super long.

<p>So I climbed up and into the big paper recycling dumpster. I had always wanted to do that! They were right behind me and were soon at the dumpster and David and Katherine climbed in before I thought, "hmmmm, we probably shouldn't play in the paper recycling dumpster," so I calmly got out and let them lead me to the jail.

<p>Once in jail, I squirmed out a little little hole (like just over 18 inches in diameter) and they thought that was entertaining enough to let me go.  Heh.

<p>I got a picture of myself with a crazy black wig on, but I don't like it much.  You won't like it: <a href="/images/rob/ugly_black_wig.jpg">bleh</a>.

<p>I think I'll go to Walgreen's and pick up the roll of pics I mentioned in a recent entry!</p>

<p class=date>Friday 23 October 1998</p>

<p><p>Dude!</p>

<p><p>I just found a ton of pics and have scanned several.</p>

<p><p><a href="/images/college/front_page.jpg">This</a> is my favorite of them all. I was on the front page of The Daily Cougar, UH school newspaper on Friday 18 March 1994, which is Maggie and Molly&rsquo;s birthday!</p>

<p><p><a href="/images/college/under_fountain.html">These 3 pics</a> were all taken by me or Will when we went down into the control room under the big water fountain at UH.
<br>On my site, these pics are in a directory called step, which was an acronym for Sub-Terrain Exploration Posse. I&rsquo;ll scan more of these, and I think I can find our charter.</p>

<p><p>Oh yes!  I have just scanned and uploaded the initial formation of the ultra-top-secret ultra-short-lived <a href="/images/college/mission_statement.jpg">Sub-Terrain Exploration Posse</a></p>

<p><p><a href="/images/college/broken_disc.jpg">This</a> was taken after we played High Speed Wall Collision with the disc.</p>

<p><p><a href="/images/college/kristof.html">These</a> are of me and Marcel posing as Kristof and Kristof&hellip; It&rsquo;s a long story.  Okay, I&rsquo;ll tell you.</p>

<blockquote>I was on the Homecoming Committee in 1993 and fanagled myself the position of Recycling Day Chairperson.  All semester, Marcel and I had been doing our impressions of Hans and Frans from Saturday Night Live.

<p>"Yah, dasright!"

<p>So anyway, we thought, wouldn't it be cool to make a TV commercial advertising Recycling Day and we could be Hans and Frans and it will be great!

<p>Then we were all, wait 'Hans and Frans' might be a trademarked name, so we won't use it.  Hmmmm.. what are some good German names?   hmmmm.

<p>That semester we were taking Databases with Dr Eick, a tall almost hulking man with a thick German accent.  (We had so much fun doing impressions of him, but that's a different story.)
His first name was Kristof.

<p>Kristof!! That's a great German name!  Hmmmm  okay we need one more..

<p>We couldn't think of another good german name so after a while, a conversation went like this:

<p>"Dude.  Why don't we both be Kristof?"

<p>"Dude!  Hmmm.  Let's try it."

<p>"I'm Kristof!"

<p>"Yah, und I'm Kristof!"

<p>"And if you don't recycle, we'll be pissed off!!!!!"

<p>YES!!!!

<p>So we put on sweat pants and sweat shirts, stuffed them with balloons and made the commercial, which was entirely entirely so much fun.

<p>The film editor put the thing together and put it on the UH (campus only) TV station and it was great.  Except there was no audio recorded with it.

<p>Sigh..  So no one got to hear our super hilarious accents and our oh-so-witty names.  But we had fun.</p>

                        <p><title>pictures of the tree that fell</title></p>

<p class=date>Thursday 22 October 1998</p>

<p>Today was a beautiful day and I got into a picture taking, picture
scanning mood.  I walked barefoot from my house to Walgreen's and
bought a little disposable camera, then back past my house and took
pictures where Montrose crosses Allen Parkway. I haven't finished the
roll yet, but soon, oh so soon, I shall scan those pics and give you a
before/after (wet/dry) comparison from the day it flooded.

<p>However, I did scan some other pictures!  From when the <a
href="/cgi-local/journal.pl?date=1998/08#tree_fell">tree fell</a> in my parking lot. I had
accidentally scanned some thumbnails and now I shall use those
in this journal entry to reference the big pics I scanned today.

<p>(I didn't make sure I scanned the exact same photos, but I think I
pretty much did that anyway.  Let's see how it goes.  Click on the
images to get the big version)

<p><table border="0" width="60%" align="center"> <tr><td><a
href="/images/apt3/tree_fell/arrival.jpg"><img
src="/images/apt3/tree_fell/thumbs/arrival2.jpg" align="left"
border="0"></a> Okay, when I arrived, this is pretty much what I saw,
except I arrived at 11pm, and after calling my landlord and him
calling the light company, and them calling the tree crew, these guys
showed up at 5am.  </td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="/images/apt3/tree_fell/my_window.jpg"><img src="/images/apt3/tree_fell/thumbs/room_window3.jpg" align="left" border="0"></a>
From the top of the stairs, this is a view of my room window. I didn't think to take a pic from inside that window...
</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="/images/apt3/tree_fell/staircase.jpg"><img src="/images/apt3/tree_fell/thumbs/top_stairs1.jpg" align="left" border="0"></a>
This view is looking down the stairs.  I made rainforest howling monkey noises as I climbed up them when I first got home.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="/images/apt3/tree_fell/on_a_limb.jpg"><img src="/images/apt3/tree_fell/thumbs/on_a_limb.jpg" align="left" border="0"></a>
After some initial trimming with the long pole things, this guy got up in the tree with a chainsaw.  Not too long after he started some of the neighbors asked incredulously if the work has to be done "now???"  
</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="/images/apt3/tree_fell/on_a_shorter_limb.jpg"><img src="/images/apt3/tree_fell/thumbs/on_a_shorter_limb.jpg" align="left" border="0"></a>
As the branch pieces fell, some hit the phone wires below them; my phone was out of service for about 36 hours after the entertainment
</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="/images/apt3/tree_fell/wires.jpg"><img src="/images/apt3/tree_fell/thumbs/wires.jpg" align="left" border="0"></a>
The smaller portion of the trunk was leaning against the telephone wires, which I believe is what kept it from falling all the way over.
<br>However, the tree was improperly trimmed because of those same wires; so they kinda helped it fall in the first place.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="/images/apt3/tree_fell/clipping.jpg"><img src="/images/apt3/tree_fell/thumbs/pole.jpg" align="left" border="0"></a>
Here's the guy gently clipping small branches out of the wires before cutting the larger branch at its base.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="/images/apt3/tree_fell/hanging.jpg">I didn't scan a thumnail of this one.</a>
<br>I was nervous when he lashed himself to the phone wire to get a better reach way up into the branches.
</td></tr>


<tr><td>These next two shots are different from the larger images, but show the same idea. The thumbnails are the top portion of the branch, and the bigger images are the bigger lower portion of the same branch.</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="/images/apt3/tree_fell/branch_up.jpg"><img src="/images/apt3/tree_fell/thumbs/branch_up.jpg" align="left" border="0"></a>
Once it was trimmed, the branch was similarly lashed to the telephone wire.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="/images/apt3/tree_fell/branch_down.jpg"><img src="/images/apt3/tree_fell/thumbs/branch_down.jpg" align="left" border="0"></a>
The carefully placed knots worked perfectly to lower the branch to the ground.  I was impressed.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="/images/apt3/tree_fell/branches.jpg"><img src="/images/apt3/tree_fell/thumbs/limbs.jpg" align="left" border="0"></a>
From the top of the stairs, I could barely see the parking lot. When the guys left, they left all the branches and the trunk and everything except their stuff.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="/images/apt3/tree_fell/trunk.jpg"><img src="/images/apt3/tree_fell/thumbs/trunk.jpg" align="left" border="0"></a>
At this moment I really began to recognize how different the landscaping would be.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="/images/apt3/tree_fell/feet.jpg"><img src="/images/apt3/tree_fell/thumbs/two_feet.jpg" align="left" border="0"></a>
The trunk was about 2 feet tall.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="/images/apt3/tree_fell/wall.jpg"><img src="/images/apt3/tree_fell/thumbs/no_limb.jpg" align="left" border="0"></a>
The big pic is after these limbs were cleaned up.  It was well into the afternoon, so the lighting is quite different.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="/images/apt3/tree_fell/scott.jpg"><img
src="/images/apt3/tree_fell/thumbs/scottie.jpg" align="left"
border="0"></a> This is my car, Scott, taken from the top of the
stairs.
</table>

<p>Just as I was finishing this entry, my cat Spot hopped up onto my
computer desk and I snapped a few pics of him in the same roll as the
previously mentioned photos of Montrose and Allen Parkway.

<p>I'll be sure to scan a pic of Spot when these come back.</p>

Could you get me the names of that tree company that had the guy strapped to the phone line?  That&rsquo;s a major no no in the tree care industry.<br>

<p class=date>Wednesday 21 October 1998</p>

<p>Yesterday was big fun at gymnastics.

<p>I've stopped practicing my round off back flips, and toned them down to round off back handsprings.

<p>Why? So I can do round off back handspring back flip, of course!  I've got to lower the angle/height/energy etc to get the back flip down to a back handspring.  I've also got to overcome my fear of bonking my head on back handsprings!  (That means I'll need to quit bonking my head by having my arms too far apart, and *that* means I'll need to continue stretching my shoulders so my arms can easily block my weight)

<p>Last night, BB (one of the coaches) would help spot me on the back handsprings.. Actually it was more of a psychological spot because he didn't actually help me over; he just stood beside me in case I crashed.  I would do a round off, stop, and then do a back handspring, with the goal of getting the stop to be shorter and shorter:  stop - stp - st - s -

<p>I became pretty confident at them (the confidence waxes and wanes) and only boinked my head a tiny bit once.  I even got the stop to be only a stp

<p>Near the end of the hour, I zipped over to the runway trampoline where Eric was trying some front flip half twist thing. We alternated passes on the trampoline, and I did my fun backflip, backflip, backflip, backflip, backflip with twist onto mat trick.  I get a teeny bit dizzy for a second after doing that!

<p>Then I was all, "I think I'll do a 1 and 3/4 front flip."

<p>The first one was nice.  {boingy} (flip fli) (land on back) Perfect.

<p>The second one was not as good.  {boingy} (flip fl) (land on head; hear a bit of a crunch in the neck)  Ow.

<p>BB was all, "Rob.  No.  Don't be trying that one again."

<p>I told him I woulda stopped anyway even without him saying so.

<p>"Good, because that was pretty spooky."

<p>"Well, at least it's near Halloween!"

<p>I went home and stayed up chatting with Jen over ICQ till damn 2am.

<p>This morning my neck is a bit sore, with slightly limited movement; I think I shall call my chiropractor now.

<p class=date>21 October 1998</p>

<p>After chatting with Jen last night, I shut down Windows and booted my linux partition.  After a bit of playing, I found the following interesting numbers (among many many others) on my screen:

<p><pre>
666667
888887
987659
1000003
1001003
1234577
1357901
1444441
1777771
3333331
1777777777
214783647
</pre>

<p>"So?" you may ask.

<p><a href="index.html">Back</a> you may press.

<p>What are those numbers?

<p>They are all prime numbers.  Like 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, ... they can only be evenly divided by 1 and themselves.

<p>Really?

<p>Well, I don't know, but I trust the linux executable to know what it's doing.

<p>214783647 was the largest number I could start it counting from.  Any number larger than that to start and it would respond with "Ouch."

<p>However, I piped the output through less and came up with 1777777777 as prime.  Cool.

<p>I let it run all night and the largest prime it found was 4294967291.
<br>Nice.

<p class=date>Tuesday 20 October 1998</p>

<p>Finally the MR Laboratories Advertising Department has gotten off their duff and begun the first teeny steps into advertising.

<p>For all you new readers, MR Labs is my new website design company. I personally am the President, Treasurer, Secretary, Supreme Ultimate God of the Whole Universe, and Janitor. Marcel, my homie, is simply the Super Ultimate God of the Whole Universe and the Bean Counter.

<p>Anyway, I am also the Advertising Department of MR Laboratories and I have a problem: fear.

<p>I am afraid of rejection I may face by putting myself "out there."

<p>"HI. I design websites."

<p>"That's nice."

<p>Or worse yet:

<p>"HI. I design websites."

<p>"Who cares? What makes you think you can do it any better than anyone else? What are your rates? Who is your competition? What makes your product better than theirs? Why would I need a website anyway????"

<p>"Um, I don't know," and I go shrivel up in a corner and die.

<p><hr>

<p>But I've got to do this. If I don't advertise, I'll have to grovel back to a JOB, and have a boss other than myself, and have to wear frikkin' shoes for goodness sakes!   

<p>UN-AC-CEPTABLE!!!

<p>I have to do my own business thing just to see if I can do it!  This is like the next obvious step in my life quest for freedom or something. Yeah - freedom to keep track of my whole business.. am I crazy?? 

<p>I dunno.

<p>So ANYway, I made my first phone call today to a company that puts ads on the back of register receipts at local grocery stores and stuff. He gave me a price: $1575 for 2 stores for 12 weeks at ~25,000 customers per week per store and like 500,000 ads sprinkled over the whole mix.

<p>I told him "website design" and "just getting started" and smiled and he was all, "okay $1050. $1000 if you pay up front."

<p>So I called Marcel, head of MR Laboratories Bean Counting Department. The conversation went like this:

<p>"Dude?"

<p>"Dude!"

<p>"Dude."

<p>"Dude?"

<p>"$1050 / $50/client = 20 clients.  20 clients / 500000 ads = 0.004%."

<p>"Dude!"

<p>So I'm going to call the guy back to get a sense of what percentage of ads gather phone calls and if it's bigger than 0.01% then I'm going for it.

<p>The ad will feature Marty and Rad, exclaiming happily, "we can do it, dude!"

<p>My Fear asks, "what if it's 0.1%? What if it's 1.0%? What will you do when you can't handle the workload?"

<p>Dude. I'll call Marcel.
