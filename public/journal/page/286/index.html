<p>After passing out copies of the second chapter of Patrick Buchanan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Day of Reckoning&rdquo;- as supporting evidence, Vaillancourt opened his remarks quoting &ldquo;fools rush in where wise men fear to tread&rdquo;-, and it sounded like a set up to condemn a rush to impeach. But instead he said that Betty Hall is neither fool nor wise man, but is a model of courage and that her impeachment resolution should be supported.</p>

<p>A date of 2013 was given as the time for official disclosure and/or when extraterrestrials show up in an unambiguous way. In the interim there will be acclimation related releases of information. Importantly, the source revealed that the events leading up to official disclosure will involve more ethically oriented extraterrestrials, and they will not pose a military threat to the world.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t really understand the POV (author vs audience) of this article; it seems like it&rsquo;s a copy of a transcript or something.. but anyway, I like this kinda thing when dates are given.. Nice juicy dates that aren&rsquo;t too far away. I can wait until 2012. Er, I mean 2013.</p>

<p>This feature is something that I wanted to pluck from Flock and move to FF. Now it seems that I can.</p>

<p>AND, the interface for ScribeFire is way smoother than the one on Flock. (e.g. just enter the blog URL and it determines the type and the api entry point; e.g. start a blog entry and <em>then</em> setup the u/p to the blog)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a spy satellite!! How can they not know when it lost power? It seems more likely that someone knows quite well exactly when it lost power, but just didn&rsquo;t say anything publicly.</p>

<p>BUT&hellip;. maybe there are just so many spy satellites all on autopilot that someone didn&rsquo;t notice?? wtf??</p>

<p>The bombardment near the Arab Jabour area on the southern outskirts of Baghdad is part of a new countrywide push against insurgents called Operation Phantom Phoenix,&hellip;</p>

<p>The official said the area is one of the last insurgent &ldquo;safe havens&rdquo; in the agricultural region that includes sprawling fields and farmlands.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure if it includes farmlands, it includes farm houses and innocent Iraqis.</p>

<p>What a fuckin&rsquo; nightmare to destroy more of the country than they have already.  I&rsquo;m sure this is resulting in less than &ldquo;diminishing returns,&rdquo; but in negative returns: more hatred toward the US, loss of any remaining respect in the world, and a waste of money to boot.</p>

<p>And by &ldquo;waste of money,&rdquo; I mean funneling money into pockets of war profiteers.  Stop it stop it stop it.</p>

<p>Whether it is the loss of a decent job, impossible conditions at work, rising prices, the threat of foreclosure or bankruptcy, the promise of endless war in Iraq and elsewhere, crumbling infrastructure, the elimination or slashing of social services and programs—US society is coming apart at the seams. None of the presidential candidates of the two big business parties is either willing or able to address these burning problems.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking this for most of the time I&rsquo;ve been in Japan; it&rsquo;s one reason I&rsquo;ve not wanted to go back. Usually I just say I don&rsquo;t want to support a government that&rsquo;s trying to kill the world. But that it&rsquo;s killing its own citizens is equally good reason not to go back. Killing in terms of letting Katrina victims die; crappy health care system; crappy education system; crappy use of energy; crappy etc.</p>
