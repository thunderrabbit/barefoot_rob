<p>Gave my email address or website to about 8 students today.</p>

<p>Lots of level 4s and 3s today.  Lowest was level 5.  Actually the
lowest was a level 3, but officially it was level 5.</p>

<p>Gave mkp site to about half the students today.</p>

<p>Inquired several times about the idea of bringing mkp to Japan.</p>

<p>It seems I've kinda given up on memorizing my whole speech.  The
agonizing hours don't seem to be worth it.  I can just read it in
romanji and have a much more relaxed time before and during the
speech.  I'm here to learn Japanese, not here to kill myself
memorizing Japanese that is too difficult for me to realistically
learn in such a short timespan.</p>

<p class=date>11:39pm</p>

<p>Soon as I wrote that, I got this:</p>

<pre>

From: "atsuko"
Date: Wed Sep 24, 2003  23:31:03 Asia/Tokyo
To: "ROBERT"
Subject: How are you?

To Rob

How do you feel today? I hope you are pretty good.
Today I brought you an old saying such as no pain no gain.
I'm sure 1000 キロ もの みちのり　を.... is one of hard phrase in your speech.

So read it loud please.

うおう　さおう　して　is your favorite
So enjoy it.

ジョンソンうちゅうせんたー...is almost same as English and your home town.
So no sweet.

You have more 4days.  Please enjoy your wonderful Japanese speech.

<p>brain is a blank slate.    Tossed a few texts back and forth on my
phone with stephanie.  she said hi in the middle of the night while I
was sleeping so I texted her back; I knew she had a doctors appt
today; wondered how that went.  This concept of Stephanie saying HI
from some thousand miles away gives me a hint of future things.  I
have stated that I'll know I'm in the future when I can contact or be
contacted verbally (and visually, but that's harder for me to imagine)
by any of my peeps in realtime from anywhere in a chat type way.  I
wonder if we could just speak and have a chat with similar parameters
to an AIM chat: users can walk away or whatever, making the chat super
slow.   verbal "hey what's up?" might be replied immediately or never
acknowledged or blah blah.</p>

<p>Stephanie seems to be doing rather poorly and likened herself to
the movie Girl, Interrupted, a movie which I have not yet seen.  I
don't really understand what might be going on with her; but I hope
she can feel better / normal soon.</p>

<p>Hey i didn't write a state of my life address this month.</p>

<p>Just spent about three hours grinding and drilling through my
speech with Atsuko, the Japanese woman who wants to be called Liz.
Definitely thankful for her time.  Definitely scared about my speech.
Definitely can keep charging through.  Went to Mister Donuts where
there's not a no-smoking area, but a no-smoking <em>time</em>; before
5pm it's no smoking.  She changed (simplified) a lot of my speech,
which bugged me at first, but jeez louise it's gotta be simplified or
I'll never get through this shit.</p>

<p>Miki and Kaori get special thanks for their help with my speech.
Miki and I ate and speeched at a ramen shop (all ramen is hot ramen)
until Kaori arrived and we went to a Jonathan's in Musashi Kosugi.
Work work worked on my speech and made some headway.  They
alterred/trimmed it even more for me.</p>

<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<p><ul>
<li><p>One of my students asked me if I am normally patient.  She was
(I believe) referring to the patience required to teach.  I think I&rsquo;m
patient when I teach, but I&rsquo;m not really patient in the rest of my
life.  I silently want to pass all the hordes of stone-faced Japanese
shuffling up/down the steps in the train station; I want my train to
be here right <em>now</em>; When I&rsquo;m alone I walk in high gear all the
time.  I always try to optimize my path, not waste any time.
Continually have a dialogue in my head defending my decisions.
(that&rsquo;s a different story)</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>I have given my email address out to a bunch of students.
Probably 20 or so.  Almost all women.  But not for overt (here I am
suddenly defending my actions.  Why is it all women?   Cause I&rsquo;m more
comfortable flirting with women than I am with men.  Cause I want
attention from women moreso than men.  Even though I want to bring the
New Warrior Training to Japan, I have spoken almost exclusively to
women about it.) sexual connections (what&rsquo;s optimal here; to stick to
my rule that parenthesis should be removable and leave a sentence
intact, or to make something legible in other contexts?   or just
leave it hanging cause I&rsquo;ve gone so far off topic?)</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>I am now living in Frank&rsquo;s old room.  The tatami room in our
apartment at 101 Bell Wisteria in Tarumachi (between Tsunashima and
Okurayama stations), Kouhokuku, Yokohama (near Tokyo), Kanagawa, Japan
(small island east of China)</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>I&rsquo;ve been working lots on memorizing a difficult speech in
Japanese.  I&rsquo;m impatient to do that now.</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>Stephanie, my homegirl at Kawasaki, left Nova/Japan after five
weeks.</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>Oh, I remember the point of number 2 above: I have been giving
more energy to bringing the new warrior thing to Japan.  But the rate
at which I&rsquo;m moving would make it a multiple year project it seems.
Fuck that.  If somethin&rsquo;s gonna happen, it&rsquo;s gotta happen now.  Or
close to now.  Sometimes I just throw myself at a project and forsake
everything else, but projects never (rarely) keep my attention for
long.  Seems that my journal has captured my imagination for the
longest time.</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>right now all my energy goes to the speech.  except for right
now when I&rsquo;m writing and elsewise when I&rsquo;m at work.   I&rsquo;m really happy
that the speech will be over soon after janette arrives; I would hate
to be distracted by that when she is here.</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>janette is coming soon!   3.5 days.  Holy shit.</p></p>

<p>(in a good way)</p></li>
</ul>

<br>hey!  i am reallly grateful i get to be there when you give this speech. <br>
 i suppose it will be like when i watch you climb a viaduct or a waterfall. i do not worry.  i know you will succeed and blow me away in the process with your mastery and power. <br>
that&rsquo;s one of the many,many things i love about you. success is your only fuckin option, failure&rsquo;s not.<br>
  and if you need to work on your speech while i am first there with you- well you just go right ahead.  i&rsquo;ll just take off my clothes and climb in bed and rub your&hellip;oh, sorry.  am i distracting you? <br>

<p>At work I chatted with two level 4 women, telling them my idea
about bringing the warrior training to Japan.  They approved.
"<em>Please</em> save Japan."</p>

<p>This tells me two things: she knows there is a problem, and she's
not ready to take responsibility for solving it.</p>

<p>I gave them homework:  "If there is a problem, say something."</p>

<p>Also gave them the <a href="https://www.mkp.org">MKP</a> website and
my email address.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>In my last lesson, I taught a senior kid student (age 11 or so) and
taught him animal vocab (penguin, dolphin, hippopotomus) and classes
(mammal, reptile, bird, fish) and some of their similarities and
differences.</p>

<p>I wear shoes, slacks, shirt and tie to work everyday.  I ride my
bike from my house to the train station each day. When it rains, I
don't care if I get wet, but my clothes generally care.  SO when it
rains and I'm riding my bike, I point my umbrella forward and the wind
pressure keeps it pressed against my (granny bike's) basket. That way
I can keep both my hands on the handlebars (very important for safety)
as the umbrella keeps my clothes dry (and I can see over it (equally
important for safety)).</p>

<p>I was in second gear (of three) when I got to the
bridge/intersection, the light for which is usually green, but today
was not.  So I had to stop.  And hold the umbrella since insufficent
speed won't keep it in place.  Light turned green and I started in
second gear up the slight slope of the bridge, and couldn't shift
cause I was holding the umbrella.  Slightly tricky, but not so
bad. Once I got moving over the crest of the bridge, I remounted the
umbrella and held both handlebars as people clogs vexed my path on the
sidewalk, and I zipped onto the street; this seemed no problem in the
rain since it was relatively free of cars.</p>

<p>Umbrella happily blocking the rain from my shirt tie and pants, me
happily enjoying the rain on my face and doing something no one else
does, I approached the intersection at the bottom of that slight hill.
Because I was slowing down, I grabbed the umbrella so it wouldn't
fall, and instinctively held it up over my head, cleanly flicking my
glasses off my face into the street.</p>

<p>For an instant, I was like, <em>fuck 'em; I'm not going back,</em>
but then waves of fear hit me saying I wouldn't be able to do
*anything* at work involving reading / writing.</p>

<p>Skidded to a stop and went back for them.  I hadn't been going too
fast, so they weren't too far back.  Fortunately, few cars were in the
street, and no cars were on my glasses.</p>

<p>So thankful</p>

<p>Riekosan helped me get through the first two <em>pages</em> (of
three) of my speech.  I've not memorized them, but have correctly
pronounced them and have been introduced to the vocabulary on both
pages.  She was really tired; I acknowledge her effort to help me.</p>

<p>I have nearly memorized the first six lines of my speech.  I can
pretty much zing through the first 3, slowly recite the fourth, and
muddle through the fifth and sixth lines.  The seventh line is a lot
shorter/easier than the previous two, so it is nearly a given once
I've finished the first 6 lines.  The eighth line is the final line on
the first page, and it's kinda sorta easy.  Easy as the second
line.</p>

<p>Second page only has four (long-ish) lines, so that will be easier
than the first page.   I'm practically done!</p>

<p>We ate dinner at a shabu shabu restaurant.   Hajimete for me.  I
kept thinking about No Pants Shabu Shabu, which Frank talked about a
lot on his last night.  I didn't mention my awareness of such a thing
to Rieko.</p>

<p>I'm really thankful for her help.</p>
