<p>Today at work everything went pretty well.  I'm at that stage where
I'm just basically there, doing my thing - not in super brain-overload
processing mode.</p>

<p>Talked to Janette who said the earthquake was reported to be 4.3 or
5.1, depending on the news source.  She asked about my new gaijin card
and I told her I'll get it in a couple days.  So I was looking for the
uber-important document to getting my gaijin card: my passport.  Right
now, it seems to be missing.   I'm not freaked yet, but I will destroy
my room tonight until I find it.</p>

<p class=date>1:06am</p>

<p><b>room status:</b> intact</p>
<p><b>passport:</b> found</p>
<p><b>me:</b> relieved</p>

<p>It was in the correct place almost.  I had put it in my undershirt
drawer instead of my underwear drawer.</p>

<p>Welp, unless something quite surprising happens, I won't be
attending either of the Eminem concerts in Japan this month.  Just
today two things happened:</p>

<p>(one) Jon offered to work any Friday for me.</p>

<p>(two) I was told I have training on the Friday of the first Eminem
concert.</p>

<p>I don't know that I could get out of the training since I normally
work on Fridays, but....  it sure seemed like an interesting cusp of
possibilities.</p>

<p>I got to work early and Masahiro, Yuki, Sumika all helped me with
my Japanese skillz.  I helped Masahiro with a couple of English
words.</p>

<p>Happy mother's day to all you mothers and your mothers.</p>

<p>Last night while at the internet cafe, I felt an earthquake!  But
the weird thing is that I didn't know at the time it was an earthquake
and I'm kinda pissed about that.  I mean shit how can I be mad at
myself for that?  Cause I didn't get up out of my chair to "confirm"
it was an earthquake.  I just thought it was some cat rocking the
flimsy cubicles for some weird reason.   I should gotten up and at
least felt the floor moving, since I wasn't outside to feel the ground
move directly beneath me.</p>

<p>So I didn't actually find out until today that it was an
earthquake. They were talking about it at work and Olivia goes, "tell
me you felt it last night!" cause, all emotions aside, it was a doozy
of an earthquake.  Frank said that people at his work were saying it
was the largest they've felt in 5 years of being in Japan.   And we
had another earthquake the previous day and I'm like "cool! bring 'em
on!" and Frank is like, "what? you're crazy man."</p>

<p>Olivia reports basically being worried about them, saying that
"they" say we are due for a major earthquake soon.  I'm excited about
the idea.  I don't want a bunch of people to die, but I like the idea
of safely experiencing something that makes world headlines.</p>

<p class=dream>Playing sports on a hill and as I slowly climbed up the
hill to my hotel I was collecting cheap balls and frisbees and such.
The frisbees were ultimate calibre and a guy bit me on the back as I
tried to get away with his frisbee but I started tohit him with it and
he let me go as one of his friends was all, "it's only a frisbee"</p>

<p class=dream>The cool thing about this frisbee - it was printed on
the underside instead of the top.</p>

<p class=dream>I got to the hotel and I had a nerf football.  A kid
was all coming up the hill and I gave it to him.  I walked into the
hotel wearing only underwear and I approached the front counter thing
discreetly and waved the guy over to me.  "Hey man; I know I'm not
exactly fully dressed.  But my clothes are all upstairs."</p>

<p class=dream>"We'll arrest you if you try to come in."</p>

<p class=dream>"No you won't; I'm just going to run up there and get
my clothes and sleep."</p>

<p class=dream>"It doesn't look like you'll be up very early."</p>

<p class=dream>"Yeah I will; I have to be up at 7."</p>

<p><em>... be up at seven .... be up at seven....  seven 7 seven
seven..</em> Oh damn.  that's today.</p>

<p>Thank you brain for waking me up.</p>

<p>Today was pretty busy at work, but I didn't freak and need a hug
nor assistance like I did the last time (and Carla helped me).</p>

<p>I got off work around 6pm and decided to check my email to see if
anyone is looking for an English teacher just like me.</p>

<p>I then decided I was too tired, so I headed.... not toward home,
but toward the grocery store and bought some stuff, including what I
hoped was soy milk, but turned out to be rice milk.  And including
what I hoped were blueberry cookies but turned out to be black bean
crackers.</p>

<p>Came home, discovered my misconceptions, ate some anyway.  Ate
chocolate until my tum was like, "okay, enough chocolate" and a little
pile of wrappers collected on the bed.</p>

<p>Decided to nap right after I finish reading livejournal entries and
I just finished that.  My resulting mood is like....  glad that I'm
"up to date" on people's lives, and wondering if my own life is going
along in an optimal configuration.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Pretty much it is; I mean shit; I'm living in Japan and pretty much
have gotten stabilized despite some setbacks that some might consider
pretty major</p>

<p>Oh!  It's time for a State of My Life Address.</p>

<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>I'm living in Japan!  I've been here since 27 March 2003.</p></li>

<li><p>Significant events include:</p>

<ol type="i">
<li><p>Navigating without direct human help my way to my apartment
from Shinjuku</p></li>
<li><p>Losing my hotel key on my second day here (and finding it that
same day)</p></li>
<li><p>Being handed a practically free Japanese instructor,
Koko.</p></li>
<li><p>Being handed a free bike for the duration of my stay by Koko's mom</p></li>
<li><p>Coming home to find said bike towed</p></li>
<li><p>Signing up for 7.5 hours per week of Japanese lessons.</p></li>
<li><p>Losing my wallet while trying to recover the bike</p></li>
<li><p>Intentionally, deliberately, choosing to start over with a new
wallet.  "Fuck the loss.  Move on."</p></li>
<li><p>Getting great help from Koko canceling bank cards, getting new
ID cards.  Getting help from Koko's mom recovering the bike.</p></li>
<li><p>Finding the bike towed *again*, but not as far away</p></li>
<li><p>Learning where to park the bike without fear of towage</p></li>
<li><p>Benefitting from Japanese lessons.</p></li>
</ol></li>

<li><p>I've noticed some things including:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>I don't have to go back to the US after a year.</p></li>
<li><p>I can really truly live on my own in pretty much any country in
the world.</p></li>
<li><p>I really can learn Japanese.</p></li>
</ol></li>

<li><p>Part of me is considering learning Chinese as my next
language.  I know Tyler has done it; I believe I can do it.</p></li>

<li><p>I've signed up on <a
href="https://www.findateacher.net">www.findateacher.net</a> to begin
expanding my income streams away from just working at Nova.  I should
be able to make twice as much per hour tutoring this way.</p></li>

<li><p>I've created a white board calendar on my wall which currently
monitors my schedule pretty easily, including three basic things:
<ol type="A">
<li>work schedule</li>
<li>study schedule</li>
<li>workout schedule</li>
</ol>
</p></li>

<li><p>My workout schedule is pretty simple:  Do twice as many pushups
per day as the date.  Today is the 10th of May.   I did 20 pushups
this morning.  Next month I'll bump it up to thrice as many pushups
per day as the date.  I won't go past that.  93 pushups is plenty for
one day.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm proud of how well I've been studying.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm happy that I've not jam-cram-packed my schedule with stuff.
I'm willing to add tutoring (making moolah) to my schedule, but that's
basically it.</p></li>

<li><p>My room is kindof a mess.</p></li>

<li><p>I've developed a way to teach some prepositions in a systematic
way that I believe is pretty accurate and hopefully quite helpful:</p>

<li><p>Work at Nova is not so bad.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm proud of myself for beginning the process of becoming self
employed here and not just living at the mercy of Nova and how much
money I can make with them.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm proud of myself for engaging the world around me, but not
doing it in a desperate frenzy of socializing (read drinking and
sexing to forget (read cover) all my problems) out late at nights and
such.</p></li>

<li><p>Sometimes I wonder if I could learn more Japanese by being "out
in it" but I imagine that I'll learn enough as I engage the world more
carefully.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm really proud of myself for charging forward despite any
obstacles.  Overall, that's what I seem to be doing.</p></li>

<p>Thank you for your support.</p>

<p>Today was the best day in Japan.  My best day yet.</p>

<p>Started off arriving early to Shibuya for my Japanese lesson with
Ayana (even though I got lost on the way there.  Soon as my train
started going the wrong direction (down into a tunnel instead of up
into Shibuya) I noticed.  I had gotten on a train at the right station
and the right direction, but the wrong final destination).  Did pretty
well in the lesson; I basically knew all 12 verbs she had assigned 2
weeks ago.  Got a good appreciation for what my students go through.
One of the students seems to laugh like something is really hilarious
as he's trying to form questions.  I'm like, "what's so fuckin' funny,
just ask a question."</p>

<p>As I formulated questions in my head, I laughed.  Then I realized
that I was laughing in the same situation as he does.  I've got all
these words bouncing around in my head like verbal ping pong balls in
a tornado.  Most of them are English words, all lining up carefully,
ready to come out as questions, but first they all have to jump
through a hoop of translation.  They all jump through and I note that
only one comes out translated.  I put a collar on that word, throw the
rest of the words out and new ones immediately line up (some of the
old ones sneak in because they have frequent flyer miles), and I try
to keep in the line all the words that are wearing collars.  Some of
the words jump through the hoop out of order in an attempt to be
helpful or maybe cause they're just excited and know they can do it.
Some of them jump through the wrong hoop and come out in the wrong
language, usually Spanish.</p>

<p>Work today was a breeze at KQ.  Empty lessons and a lot of 1 on 1s
and then the best lesson ever with those hilarious 7Cs, one of whom
was pretty cute.  Her teeth were messed up in a good and crooked way,
but they were clean.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>On the way home I made flashcards for new verbs and mneumonics to
learn most of them.  I stopped by GeraGera internet cafe and signed up
with findateacher.net.  This is awesome cause it's me beginning to
grab hold of my own financial situation and not just rely on what
money I can make by making money for Nova.  I can give the students
better value for lower cost and I don't have to not use Japanese in
the classroom.  Blah blah all the good things about being self
employed.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Finished that, uploaded entries, left and found my bike still
waiting for me at the bike parking lot.  Nice.</p>

<p>Talked to Janette all the way home and when I arrived, found my mom
had sent me a letter and she's planning to come see me in September!
And Janette had sent a box of chocolate!!  Whoohooooo!!  I'm the
luckiest man in all of Japan.</p>

<p>"Jesus dude, you've got some dedicated fans."

<br>this passage is great-  the visual of words jumping thru the hoop, sometimes the wrong hoop and it comes out spanish, or words rushing the hoop out of order because maybe they&rsquo;re excited.<br>
  you are so funny!  and such an imaginative writer<br>
 <br>
congratulations on mastering the bike parking test<br>

and frank- you have no idea</p>

<p class=dream>I went to some tourist attraction and Bryn was there
and I'm all "hi, <em>Bryn</em>!" and she goes "I don't want to
explain" so I ignored the gap in communication and asked how she's
doing.</p> 

<p class=dream>We were in some big hall with a huge golden flame in
the middle of the room.  Bryn was excited by something so huge and
nearly yellow so she ran down the steps to check it out.  I followed
her not quite as quickly.</p>

<p class=dream>As she gazed up at it, she noticed something amazing on
the wall - a reflection of Earth, but with the entire globe shrunk to
about five hundred dollars which you are about to give me right now,
he said.</p>

<p>oops I just fell asleep while typing and was dreaming again.</p>

<p class=dream>There was a huge image of the Earth about 30 feet in
diameter and featuring Australia which we were like, how can the image
be projected back onto earth?</p>

<p class=dream>We marveled a bit and then I told her how much fun I've
been having traveling, and she agreed and reminded me that's what she
told me in the first place back in the day.</p>

<p class=dream>I was like yeah and thankful to see Bryn again.</p>

<p>I don't remember what else.</p>

<p>I have decided to restructure my thoughts about losing things.
Yesterday I lost my pack of flashcards that I've been studying.  On it
I had translated to Japanese, "may I park here?" and took it to the
bike parking lot.  That parking lot is the last place I flat remember
having it.  I went back there and attempted to ask, translating "lost"
and "similar" because I had another set of (blank) flashcards, but the
attempt did not result in flashcard recovery.</p>

<p>I turned off the tape machine in my head that was like, "nyah nyah
you can't keep anything" and turned it to a golden message that I am
done with the item; I don't need it anymore.  Release.  Release.</p>

<p>I realize I'm no monk; I would do a double-triple-quadruple
flip-out if I lost my computer anytime soon.  But I can release a pack
of flashcards.</p>

<p>I'm at Starbucks for my lesson with Å†Å‚Ç» at 9:30 (Å≠Ç∂ÅÕÇÒ).  I'll
read Japanese until then.</p>
