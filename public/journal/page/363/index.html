<p class=dream>I was living back in Tomball except the terrain
included a huge gulley with large piles of dirt like 60+ feet tall to
shape the flow of water.  Some kids were racing motorcycles on it,
destroying the contours and creating a general nuisance of themselves.</p>

<p class=dream>I asked how I could report them and there was to be a
town meeting in a few days run via Robert's Rules and I immediately
wondered if I could remember all the rules so that I could bring up
the complaint.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class=dream>Doing laundry and Eminem was there as well preparing
for his show that was to be that night.  We started talking and he was
friendly and I wasn't nervous, but was just me and we laughed it up
about randomness.  Then I was like, "let me buy a ticket from you" but
he was all, "naw I got my friendlies" or something and was going to
give me a ticket.  He was looking through his bag for one and kept
finding old tickets to old shows.  I woke up before he gave me
one.</p>

<p>I haven't checked my account, but today is payday.  I'm glad I have
a journal, cause I had forgotten how much I planned to withdraw.  I
planned to have 55,000 yen in my wallet for the month, but I've got
45,000 yen.  I'll see how far that takes me and if I can make it for
the month on that.  I don't see a good place to note this information
so that I'll find it when I need it.  Some sort of trigger to say
"when I run out of money, remember to look _here_ for the answer."</p>

<p>Okay; that's it: when I run out of money, I'll check my journal for
the entry written on payday (the 15th) and see what it says.</p>

<p>I've got 48,000 yen and change (700 yen?) in my wallet.</p>

<p>For some reason I've got the bluhs right now.  I came home, came
and took a nap for about 3 hours after doing laundry.  I even ironed
(my version of ironing) two shirts.  It seems like after my nap I've
just been like meh about *everything*.</p>

<p>I've sortakinda cleaned up a bit of my room, but didn't finish
that.  I got sidetracked reading the Yokohama living guide and did a
little bit more laundry.  This time I didn't iron anything, including
a shirt which will be wrinkled when it dries and will need to be
ironed before I wear it, and I'll be like dammit why didn't I iron
this when I had plenty of time to iron it *and* when it was damp, a
perfect time for ironing?</p>

<p>^^^^^ that was almost enough to get me up to iron it, but I'm like,
sigh... have to get out the ironing board, turn on the iron..  like
every single thing is such a big chore.</p>

<p>Fine. fuck it I'll do it.</p>

<p>Time me.</p>

<p class=date>10:55pm</p>

<p class=date>11:10pm</p>

<p>Done.  That shit took 15 minutes.  It didn't seem like that long,
but I'm sure not any happier on the other end of it.</p>

<p>Outside I hear the drips of a previous rain.  Frank is just now
home from running I think.</p>

<p>bluh bluh bluh</p>

<p>Today I met with Koko; she was supa tired cause last night she went
out to see <em>Chicago</em> for the third time and her friend missed
the last train.  So they waited at a restaurant until the trains
started again at 4am.  She got to sleep at 5am.</p>

<p>My brain was mush as well, so I couldn't even formulate what I
wanted to learn in Japanese, *and* I hadn't taught her any English
since two weeks ago, so we did mostly English today.  She would write
lines from the movie and I would explain them.</p>

<p>"It wasn't until later when I was washing the blood off my hands
that I even knew they were dead."</p>

<p>"They had it coming."</p>

<p>"I betcha you'd have done the same."</p>

<p>"Who says that murder is not an art?"</p>

<p>"And who in case she doesn't hang can say she started with a bang?"</p>

<p>Because I had lost my old set of flashcards, I had her write my
address on my new set so they'll be returned in case I lose 'em
again.</p>

<p>We traded fucked up sentences in English and Japanese:</p>

<p>"Joe while Pete had had had had had had had had had had had the
teachers approval"</p>

<p>(There's a way to punctuate this so it's correct English.)</p>

<p>Japanese: </p>

<p>(oh wait I'm next at the bank)</p>

<p class=date>2:23pm</p>

<p>The Japanese, when spoken, was like "yammer
niwaniwaniwaniwaniwaniwaniwa yammer" or something like that.</p>

<p>When spelled using kanji, or even hiragana it made more sense.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I have withdrawn money for the next month (40,000 yen) and have
10,000 yen left in my account.  Tonight at midnight I'll be paid and I
might send all of that money to my US account.  But first I gotta get
signed up with Lloyd's.  It costs 2,000 yen each time I transfer
money, and if it takes a while for me to get signed up, then maybe it
will be smarter (?) to wait until next month (would have been smartest
to have already gotten signed up with Lloyd's but oh well) to send
nearly two paychecks worth of money over, esp. considering the rumor
is the first Nova paycheck is small since they take out our rent, our
first of three repayments of the 120,000 yen advance (interest free)
and maybe something else.</p>

<p>Shrug.   We'll see.</p>

<p>I've eaten a noodle lunch from Lawson (convenience store) out by a
bayou/river thing in Yokohama.  I imagine I can follow this river back
to Tsunashima which is what I'll find out right now.</p>

<p class=date>3:41pm</p>

<p>Made it back.   Checked out a spillway thing for a bit - wondered
if I could climb down into it without too many legal issues.</p>

<p>Just as I arrived home, Wende called me!! What excellent timing and
great to hear from her. She told me all her latest adventures and
listened to mine.  She's not been doing uber awesomely, her stinky
boyfriend is now her ex-boyfriend and stuff like that.  But she did
get to visit Texas and sees how much she'd prefer to be back there
than to be in San Fran.</p>

<p>I hope she's able to make that transition quickly and easily.</p>

<p class=date>4:09pm</p>

<p>I was gonna read/write emails and go post them, but first I'm gonna
write questions in Japanese to help get my mind wrapped around them
slash infused with Japanese. (Writing questions was my homework for
Ayana due on Friday)</p>

<p>Kids' training was.. interesting today.  Basically we were 1/2 told
about training and 1/2 "trained" as if we were kids.  At some points I
could see the entertainment and the value and at other points I was
like "this is the stupidest thing in the planet."</p>

<p>Matty said he knows of someone who quit Nova because of Kids'
Training.  I'm not going to quit, but I'm certainly not really
interested in teaching kids.  Little 3-12 year olds...  Yeeesh not for
me.</p>

<p>Met a cute girl from <em>Tasmania</em>, which made her seem all the
more interesting. Tasmania!!  Thonly thing I know about Tasmania is
that Warner Brothers has named a devil after it.</p>

<p>I was like, "eeee too cold" which I assumed was the case cause it
seems to be as far south as the northern US is north, but she was like
Nah it ain't that cold.   Maybe that's cause she's from there.</p>

<p>Anyway, we did not exchange information so I'll likely never see
her again.</p>

<p>She got fired though when I asked her what movie she doesn't like
and she said...... "Pulp Fiction."  (What a strange question, eh? but
it was part of our training today).  And she doesn't like hip hop
*and* she does like jazz.  phff. whatever.</p>

<p>I don't really talk about my roommates much, but I don't really
hang out with them. Right now they're playing Sega (?) basketball
game; they've each been playing a certain team an NBA season.  Matty
is New Orleans I think and Frank is New Jersey.  Matty just got
crushed by Orlando, and Frank suggested that one of Orlando's players
in real life isn't as good as he's depicted in the game.</p>

<p>I'm glad I prefer studying.</p>

<p>According to some very rough estimates, I spent 34000 yen over the
past 13 days.  That included 15000 for my train pass, so that's 19000
yen in 13 days for everything else I bought, most of which is food,
internet, phone calls to janette.  I can easily make it one more day
on 1000 yen (food only) or just survive on the groceries I have left
(4 eggs, 5 slices of bread, two little cans of tuna).</p>

<p>Anyway, it appears I can live for 2 weeks on 20,000 yen.  Therefore
I can live 4 weeks on 40,000 yen.  Plus my train pass.  So in a couple
days when I get paid, I'll withdraw enough so that I have 55,000 yen
in my wallet.  All but 10,000 yen will go to my home bank account.</p>

<p>I wonder how much I'll get paid.</p>

<p>Oh, speaking of studying; at Japanese class today we had a new
student named Grace (can't possibly be her given name) from Hong Kong
whose native tongue is Cantonese.  She also knows Mandarin and seems
to know English pretty well. She has recently moved from Australia
(Melbourne?) to Japan.  Now she's learning Japanese.  Nice.</p>

<p>So anyway, talking to her I'm like..... Mandarin eh?  cause she
said that Mandarin is easier than Cantonese and is more popular.
Mandarin, eh?  Hmmmm.</p>

<p>My dreams this morning featured people I haven't seen or spoken
with in a while, including Bryn and Marcel.  Each time Bryn shows up
in my dreams lately, I'm quite excited to see her.</p>
