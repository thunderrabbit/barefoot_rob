<p>Today after work Cory showed up on my train.  We went to
Sakuragicho where he was going to check out Benny's skates.  I got to
put them on, too.  Zipped around a bit.  I really miss my skates.  I
wonder if janette can bring my skates and pads and helmets and my
bike.</p>

<p>sigh.</p>

<p>The date says 7am Cali time, but that's cause I'm telnetted to my
account instead of typing it on my local computer.  It's 11pm Japan
time.</p>

<p>Pissy mood this morning to start my day since it may cost several
dollars to get my computer fixed.  I'm really anxious to have it fixed
now now now.  Interesting to release that.</p>

<p>Wow; one good thing about working on my server is that ispell works
on emacs.</p>

<p>A great thing today was getting a letter from Chez.  She asked how
I was feeling <em>right now</em>, so I took a moment to acknowledge my
feelings: sadness, anger, joy, sadness.  Mostly sadness at nothing in
particularly and at everything in my world.</p>

<p>Really thankful for Frank's computer.  This morning, instead of my
internet fix, I cleaned my room a lot.  It's not *clean*, but I
definitely noticed a difference when I got home today.  Nice feeling.
I've got a pile of stuff to send to janette.  I hope she thinks it's
all very interesting, and not just a pile of shit that I put into a
box.  A couple of things are particularly useful, and some things are
just like, "haha lok at this" and then throw it away.  I'll send her
the whole operation and let her decide what's what.</p>

<p>Rode home with Cory today.  At the very end I almost asked him,
"so, what's the reality of teachers hanging out with students?"  but
there was not really enough time for him to fully answer.  Later.
Later I'll ask.</p>

<p>I was curious because I'm going to watch _Suicide Club_ with him on
Wednesday the 27th, the same day I'll hang out with Yoshie.  I wonder
if I can tell him who I went to the park with or just have to say
she's a friend.</p>

<p>Hmm.  Frank has some DVDs here that he rented; maybe I'll watch
one, though in the past I haven't enjoyed the movies he chooses.
Meh.</p>

<p>Oh gosh, this is a bad idea.  I'm getting sidetracked on my site,
trying to do some perl magic so I can see comics dot com without all
the advertising and crap.  Similar to how Fred made a m-w
extractor.</p>

<p>Okay, okay, before I start, I'll mail Wende's letter and check my
calendar to make sure I'm not forgetting anything today.</p>

<p>(Like the 3pm appointment with Rie the travel agent at Shinjuku
station)</p>

<p>Got everything reserved for janette and I when she comes.</p>

<p>I paid a deposit and will pay the rest when I get paid next
month.</p>

<p>Differences between Japan and US: this travel agency doesn't accept
credit cards.  this travel agency looked up everything in books and
wrote up my itenerary by hand.</p>

<p>The hinge on the other side of my monitor broke.  Now the screen
won't come on at all.  Gotta send the shit in to have it repaired.</p>

<li><p>It happened while Frank's computer is still in the house.</p></li>
<li><p>They'll come pick up my machine for me.</p></li>
<li><p>It won't cost too much.</p></li>

<p>Feeling much better after taking a long walk with Fumi around
Shibuya.  Not *around* the station, but in a big circuit near the
station, including Harajuku station!  I was like wtf!  We
<em>walked</em> to Harajuku!  Wow!  Supa surprised was I.</p>

<p>Oh, before I was surprised by that, I was surprised to find us next
to a Jur-oops I shouldn't say; I want to take janette there when she
comes.  Look for an entry for 30 September 2003 (not yet, silly!).</p>

<p>Speaking of time, I was late to meet Fumi, due to Yahoo! BB
chitchat, so I bought dinner for her ($4) at a deli place that I'd
also like to take janette to when she comes.  I'm glad we came across
it!</p>

<p>Got the NTT bill and it wants 15000 yen paid for our phone bill.
Fucking YahooBB was supposed to make that shit free.  They don't have
any English speakers available at their phone number, the first number
person was all, call this number and I called that number waited
forfuckingever for a person but they were like no english bah.</p>

<p>So I'm going to the YahooBB table to hopefully negotiate someone to
call YahooBB and fix this shit.  Fuck.</p>

<p>My day is also messed up because I think Olivia is still mad at me,
but fuck that.</p>

<p>Also messed up because I'm trying to fucking get my tix and shit
figured out for janette and it's like dammit doesn't any travel agent
speak any English at all?</p>

<p>Where's Jayne?  She could fix this for me.  Best travel agent
ever.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Okay, whoever I just talked to speaks pretty good English.  I'm
glad I ranted above because I had forgotten I needed to call them
(travel agents) back.  It's gelling.  The trip will happen.</p>

<p>Now I'm going to the YahooBB table, crossing fingers that we can
get this sorted out.</p>

<p class=date>5:39pm</p>

<p>Four hours later, it's not sorted, but I certainly spent some time
standing patiently while Zuzu and her coworker yammered in Japanese on
the phone a lot on my behalf.  They certainly didn't have to do it,
and I appreciate their efforts.  Next step = wait for Yahoo! BB bill
and see if I have been double-charged for calls.  If so, then I get
reimbursed.  If not, then we'll see.</p>

<p>Sigh.  If I had been teaching English for 4 hours, I might have
15,000 yen to show for it.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>During that time, however, I did get something done: scheduled a
meeting with Rie (ha) the travel agent at 3pm in Shinjuku tomorrow.
And I learned from Zuzu that Osaka is pretty much crap, so we're not
going there.</p>
