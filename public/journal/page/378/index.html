<p><h1>State of My Life Address</h1>
<center><b>(first one in Japan)</b></center></p>

<ol>
<li><p>I'm in Japan!</p></li>

<li><p>I've come to Japan to learn Japanese, the first language in my
goal to become conversant in three languages (not English) by 2010.
To support myself during this process, I'll be working for <a
href="https://www.teachinjapan.com">Nova</a>, the most prolific ESL
company in Japan.</p></li>

<li><p>Interestingly, I wonder if I've already lost sight of my
original reason to come to Japan, or maybe if that reason is just
chillin' on a back burner (haha chillin' on a burner) in my
subconscious.</p>

<p>That reason was to get a job for a company called US Experiment (<a
href="https://www.usexperience.org">https://www.usexperience.org</a> I
think) which requires its leaders to have in-country experience in
various countries before they can lead youth group tours
there.</p></li>

<li><p>I have become aware of an Eminem concert here in Japan!
According to Cookie, the venue is a good hike from here, but I'm
definitely going to talk to a cat named Ben (at Cookie's suggestion)
who has been to some concerts there.  Ticket price is 8400 yen for
advanced tickets.  Shows are scheduled for 23 and 24 May (Friday and
Saturday).  Nice.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been living in a hotel for the past three nights.  My
apartment (which I'll be sub-leasing from Nova) is not ready yet
(read: the guy I'm replacing has not moved out yet), but I'll be
moving in today.  Adrienne G will be picking me up from the hotel to
escort me there.  That's cool though I've actually already made my way
there once.  But the cool part is that I'll be able to ask her why my
train tickets don't work the way I thought they would.</p></li>

<li><p>My hotel room features a teapot and green tea, toilet with
bidet and butt sprayer, a short bathtub that appears deep cause it's
so short, light switches at the head of the bed to control most of the
lights in the room, a flashlight in case of emergencies (earthquakes),
and two sets of pajamas clean and folded on my bed each
afternoon.</p></li>

<li><p>I lost the key to my hotel room yesterday.  Paid 2100 yen to
the front desk for a new one.  But I retraced my adventure from
yesterday and found my key in the third to last place I had visited.
Got my 2100 yen back.  (That's a 1/4 price of an Eminem
ticket!)</p></li>

<li><p>I've met Andrew (Dru Daddy G), Janelle & Kevin, Cookie (5 years
with Nova), Fiona (some years with Nova), the guy in my apartment who
I'll be replacing (didn't get his name), and some other new Nova
recruits whose names I've forgotten.</p></li>

<li><p>Lots of people smoke here.  I just try not to breathe
it.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm awake early this morning because I went to sleep early
(8pm?) last night.  I don't think it's because of jet lag (8pm JST =
5am CST), but because of culture-shock.  I'm comfortable in my hotel
room where everyone speaks English.  So after a day (12 hours) of
navigating ... you know; I don't really know where I am on a large map
of Tokyo/Yokohama ... this city, I'm ready to hibernate
again.</p></li>

<li><p>(Okay, I looked on a map.  I'm basically on the western edge of
the subway loop around Tokyo, near the Shinjuku station.)</p></li>

<li><p>I do not yet have bicycle or skates here.  I don't know if I'll
ask Janette for them, but a lot of people ride bikes.  There's
definitely more pedestrian traffic, but many bikes.  My particular
bike seems like it would stand out as higher quality than the average
bike here.  The only skates I've seen were at a skate park.</p></li>

<li><p>The only Japanese words I can use are "sumimasen" (I'm sorry /
excuse me) and "arigato" (thank you) and "hai" (yes).  Thank goodness
I can just point at display food in a restaurant, and public restrooms
are clearly marked.</p></li>

<li><p>I've purchased stationery to write to people, but I've not
gotten my computer connected, so these 20 entries I've written are
still unpublished.</p></li>

<p>I hope I haven't fucked up too badly.  Adrienne suggested that if
ABC doesn't deliver my luggage by 6:45 that I for sure call Nova and
they would track it down.  They all leave Nova at 7pm. But I fell
asleep until just now and I don't know where to find a phone except a
5 minute walk away.  But what if I leave and ABC arrives, etc.</p>

<p>My tickets say that ABC will deliver between 6pm and 9pm, so it's
likely that it will still arrive.  Also, I can hopefully wear a suit
and tie of Matt or Frank's.</p>

<p>I trust all will be A-OK with ABC.</p>

<p>One good point is that I don't see a note on the door from an
attempted delivery by ABC.</p>

<p class=date>7:28pm</p>

<p>Oh <em>man</em> I feel so tired!  I don't know what is up with
that.  Is my consciousness just shutting down as a defense against
overwhelming emotions?  Is it jetlag?  is it from my brain being in
hyper overload mode for days?</p>

<p class=date>8:05pm</p>

<p>Guess who feels more awake?</p>

<p>Guess whose luggage just got delivered?</p>

<p>Whoohooo!!</p>

<p>I actually heard the wheels of the suitcase being rolled along the
brick sidewalk and thought that must be it.  But I lowered my
expectations in case it wasn't.  But then the doorbell rang.  :-)</p>

<p class=date>8:09pm</p>

<p>Guess what's black and white and wrinkled all over?</p>

<p>My suit and shirts!  Actually the suit is pretty okay, but I gotta
iron these shirts again.  As in, I'll iron them for the first time
after Janette ironed them back at home and then said, "these will
probably need to be ironed again, but that's okay cause it's fun!"</p>

<p>Ha ha.  Good joke there, Janette.</p>

<p>Well, it's ten times more fun than not having clothes to iron.</p>

<p>Just gotta find the ironing board and iron.</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>I cannot fucking believe it's 2am.</p>

<p>I'm at a loss to capture all the hilarity of hanging out with Frank
and then hanging out with both Matty and Frank.  Frank is hilarious.
He's from Jersey, has spent years in the army, fuckin' loves his
country, says the USA is the Capital of The World, grills the shit out
of his students, especially on race issues (e.g.: "If you go to the
US, you better not go to the south cause they will kill you."
<br>" ... why? ..."
<br>"Because you're fuckin' asian, man, they hate asians
and they'll kill you!"
<br>"... but that is not fair ..."
<br>"you're damn right it's not fair, so why do you hate the Chinese
and Koreans?")</p>

<p>Brutal.  I wonder if he likes the Jim Roam Rome whatever show.</p>

<p>There's more.  I shoulda had a fuckin' tape recorder.  I can tell
that I won't likely be watching my language here.</p>

<p>Matty is a Brit, pale and tall and has to duck signficantly to go
through any doorway in the apartment.  He gives me three weeks before
I start liking asian girls.  (I'm like "no way.")  He likes Christina
Ricci over Ally McBeal, and harasses Frank for Frank's patriotism.
"They's been nothing goo to come outa new yok except the Beastie
Boys."</p>

<p>Matty also likes Eminem; we're going to go to the show presuming I
can get the night off.</p>

<p>Oh, but you know what?  They both laugh when I said I assumed I'd
be working at the Nova location closest to my apartment.  Frank does
work there, but he's an anomaly in that regard.  Matty has to commute
like 45 minutes to work each day.  Frank wakes up 40 minutes after
Matty has left so they can both be at work at the same time.</p>

<p>This morning I've tweaked the home and wtf images to make them more
closely resemble the others (raised home so it will appear on the same
level, changed font of wtf) and I created a japan image, by cutting
and pasting existing letters ktru bumper sticker style.  Hey I wonder
if I have a w, t, and f from other images that dude made me back in
the day.  Yes I do.  I may use those letters, but probably not now.
I'm going to take a nap again.  So I can maybe more easily stay up
"late" to a normal time tonight in my new apartment.</p>

<p>I'm in my new apartment.  Adrienne is from London, though she
considers Japan her home now.  Her husband's mother can make 300,000
yen (per sitting?  per day?) at the pachinko parlor.  Wow.</p>

<p>Adrienne showed me the difference between an express train and
limited express and the local train.  Limited express is even more
express than express (limited means it stops at a limited number of
stops compared to the express)</p>

<p>Got to my apartment and neither Matty nor Frank are here.  They'll
be in around 8 and 9 respectively.  Adrienne helped me set up my futon
including a pillow with beans sewn onto one side of it.  Quite soft
and lovely.  Plenty big enough to sleep on, I think, though I haven't
actually lay on it yet.</p>

<p>She said the place is bigger than she expected.  It's plenty big
enough for me.  It's about the size of my apartment on West Gray in
which I lived for 11 years.  The living room and refrigerator here are
a bit smaller than there, but it will be just fine.</p>

<p>I've been up for an hour.  Many things in Japan are beautiful and/or
functional:</p>

<p>(!) Made green tea with the little tea brewing set on the desk.  I
put the tea pot on the electric burner, pushed the on button.  Few
minutes later, the water was boiling, but I couldn't figure out how to
turn it off.  Pushed the ON button again and that didn't change
anything.  I hoped I hadn't just reset a timer to heat it for five
minutes or something.</p>

<p>Picked up the teapot and it turned off.  I verified that it wasn't
just coincidence.  When I pick up the pot, the heating element turns
off.  Nice.</p>

<p>(@) There are three pushbutton switches and a clock built into the
headboard of the bed.  One switch turns on/off the overhead light.  One
turns on/off the light above the bed.  One turns on/off a little light
at the base of the headboard, perfect for illuminating the way to the
restroom at night, without being too bright in sleepy eyes.</p>

<p>(#) The toilet is a marvel in itself.
<br>(&) sit on the seat and the bowl begins to fill with water, rather
noisily, possibly to politely cover any splashing noises of one's own.
<br>(&) finish the job and then press the button labeled with a
picture that looks like water spraying up at a butt.  Guess what it
does?  Warm water to clean, and a pressure adjustment that spans from
not-enough-to-reach to water-fountain-out-of-control all the way past
the bathroom door (not that the door is all that far away in a small
Japanese restroom).
<br>(&) and then a button labled with water spraying up at a seated
woman produces a gentler, wider stream of warm water aimed for the
vulva (or testicles)
<br>(&) the seat and lid open easily, but they make no noise when they
close.  Ever knock the lid down on a toilet at night, causing a huge
clatter and possibly waking up the entire house?  Not here.  The seat
and lid each descend softly and silently shut.</p>

<p>(*) There's a flashlight at the bottom of the headboard (for use in
case of earthquakes).  It turns on automatically when taken off its
hook and off automatically when placed on its hook.  How?  The tube of
the flashlight has a slot cut into it right where the batteries
touch.  The hook slides into that slot, both pushing the batteries
apart and holding the flashlight in place.</p>

<p>Mood: contemplative
Music: Mirah _You Think It's Like This But Really It's Like This_</p>

<p>Munched breakfast down in the restaurant; I don't know if it coulda
been free because I had a room, but it was an actual buffet, not just
a continental breakfast like at a small US hotel.</p>

<p>1600 yen for any of omletted eggs, runny scrambled eggs, ham,
sausage, tender beef & veggies, hash browns, croissant, fruit bread,
pineapple pudding, chocolate cake (for breakfast!  "Japan is great!
Give us the chocolate cake!"), peeled hard boiled eggs, corn flakes,
peas, ripe bananas, orange slices, apple slices, noodle salad, coffee,
tea, milk, orange juice, tomato juice, and grapefruit juice.</p>

<p>I tried to take cues from those around me on polite table manners.
It seemed that they used the same plates to get more food, and more
people had both hands/wrists on the table than one hand in lap.  No
elbows on tables. No one threw food or climbed on the table; no one
shouted or stuffed whole bananas into their mouth.</p>

<p>No tips left on tables, but a wait person would pick up all the
used dishes and stuff.</p>

<p>I'm at Virgin Megastore, with English music and announcer over the
loudspeaker.  Fiona said this is where they have an internet cafe and
she's exactly right, but the cafe opens at 11am.  However, the
computers are all wirelessly connected.  So I should be able to
connect right now.  They even have three different wireless signals to
choose from.</p>

<p>BUT! Each one requires and password, and the password is not
"virgin" for any of them.</p>

<p>Nice. I got some phat time online chatting with peeps and reading
lots of emails and replying to some.  Many people who want to keep
getting my updates!  I replied to those that were particularly funny
replies.</p>

<p>I gotta split and buy chapstick and meet Andrew, Cookie,
et. al. under the four story clock at the building where Nova is
headquarters!</p>

<p>Oh my gosh.</p>

<p>If I understand this little card correctly, Eminem is playing
somewhere in Japan on May 23rd and May 24th!!  Could it be?</p>

<p>Yes, it could.</p>

<p>Is it?</p>

<p>I don't know.  But if Cookie does in fact meet us (me, so far)
here, I'll ask him, and ask him to help me purchase tickets for the
show.  I hope I can go!  I won't quit my job over it, but I'll
definitely ask for the evening off.</p>

<p>Whoooo!!</p>
