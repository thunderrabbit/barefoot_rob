<p>That went terribly.</p>

<p>Conversing happily with janette and I just had to get it off my
mind that I've been having more fun in Japan (going to Warawara with
Nova peeps, riding roller coasters, beginning to see more progress in
Japanese learnin') and I think I might stay longer than January.</p>

<p>She was like, "I'm cool wit dat, yo" and then I was all, "something
something see myself doing it alone"   I don't even remember what I
said, but the "doing it alone" words rang in my head like an ambulance
stuck in traffic.</p>

<p>mood plummetted.</p>

<p>I'm so sorry.</p>

<p>man, fuck relationships.</p>

<p>fuck being alone.</p>

<p>why oh why</p>

<p>what oh what</p>

i don&rsquo;t think it is wrong to love and be loved.<br>
i think being alone sucks.<br>
i liked having someone to come home to if only in my mind,like,ouo, <br>
i can&rsquo;t wait to tell rob this, o <br>
i must share this discovery/thought /feeling/sensation/ with rob.<br>
i think someday you might want that for yourself.<br>
it doesn&rsquo;t mean you are not alone when give your heart all the way.<br>
it&rsquo;s just sharing life while being alone.<br>
i really don&rsquo;t know.<br>
i haven&rsquo;t been successful in the relationship part of life.<br>
it&rsquo;s all theory on my part.<br>

<p>I've just read the script to Kill Bill.  Well the first half that
makes up the first movie.   Now I'll have a far better chance of
understanding the Japanese during the movie.</p>

<p>Fun hanging with Miki KG tonight.  We ate at an okonomiyaki
restaurant; I was polite as possible; we served each other (she showed
the way) and chatted lots.  She asked most of the questions.</p>

<p>I showed her the Japanese I had written recently, including the
kanji for shinkansen.   She corrected one hiragana (the rest had been
corrected by Ayana) and I gave her some English grammar on 1/2 a piece
of paper that included a single "shinkansen" written on the top.</p>

<p>We walked around Cinecitta, and planned to see Kill Bill on
Thursday.  I verified three times that though there is a lot of blood,
she still wants to see the movie.  Yes, yes, yes.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Walked in the new building across from the movie place to see
what's up in there and were yammering a bit when she told me that the
UFO catchers had live lobsters in them a couple years ago.</p>

<p>"Miki." I said matter of factly like, <em>you know it's not polite
to lie.</em></p>

<p>But she assured me it was true.  Well, I have seen fighting betas
in UFO catchers; and in fact, that was only a few days ago (well, a
week now) right downstairs at the game center.  Kimashyou.</p>

<p>There were no fighting betas in a UFO catcher, but we walked around
the entire area, marveling at how people could be so smitten by the
games.</p>

<p>There's a student at KQ who I originally thought of as a barbie
living in a dream world bubble of wealth.  Her hobbies were shopping
and she wanted to live and attend school in LA and go to parties and
meet people.</p>

<p>Last I saw her, she was saying HI to Tomoko after I lost my keys at
Tokyo Dome City.</p>

<p>Today I mentioned that I hadn't seen her in a while (except for
that) and she was like, "?" and then remembered.  (For the briefest of
moments (not like nano and pico seconds, but maybe 1.5 seconds) I
thought I was mistaken) She was like, "oh, do you like Tomoko?"</p>

<p>"Yah; she's nice, but I have a girlfriend."</p>

<p>"Japanese?"</p>

<p>"No, she's in the US."</p>

<p>"Mm"</p>

<p>"So what's up?"</p>

<p>"mmmmm.  I have love problems."</p>

<p>And we spent the lesson talking about her relationship concerns
using the target languages "I (don't) like" and answers to "how
often..."  and "how much..."</p>

<p>I'm glad to know a bit more about her than nothing.</p>

FCC OKs Bono's F-Word  Slip
WASHINGTON, Oct. 7,2003

When it comes to cursing, the government says, it's all in the
delivery.  
 
That's the view of the Federal Communications Commission in its
decision that U2 singer Bono's colorful language during the Golden
Globe Awards didn't violate federal indecency rules. 
 
The FCC rejected complaints from the Parents Television Council and
more than 200 people, most of them associated with the council, who
accused dozens of television stations of violating restrictions on
obscene broadcasts by airing portions of the awards program last
January. 
 
The complaints objected to Bono's uttering the phrase "this is really,
really, f------ brilliant." 
 
The FCC, using the F-word more often to explain its decision than Bono
did on the air, said the word "may be crude and offensive, but, in the
context presented here, did not describe sexual or excretory organs or
activities." That distinction is a key test to measure whether a
statement meets a federal standard for broadcast indecency. 
 
David Solomon, chief of the FCC's enforcement bureau, said in the
ruling that Bono used the vulgarity as an adjective or to emphasize an
exclamation and that "the use of specific words, including expletives
or other 'four-letter words' does not render material obscene." 
 
The Parents Television Council, a Los Angeles-based watchdog group,
said Tuesday it would appeal the decision and the FCC is "splitting
hairs." 
 
"It's not shocking to us on the FCC decision because they're a
toothless lion," said Lara Mahaney, director of corporate and
entertainment affairs for the council. "They don't take indecency
seriously and that's why you see it proliferating on the broadcast
airwaves." 
 
The FCC rejected the complaints on Friday and announced the decision
this week. 
 
"We have previously found that fleeting and isolated remarks of this
nature do not warrant commission action," Solomon said.
