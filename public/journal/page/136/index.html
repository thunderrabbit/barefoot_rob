<p>I told Travis about my idea to walk to Niigata.  Here I&rsquo;ll just post
the email:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In other news, I&rsquo;m considering walking barefoot to Niigata, where
Lin&rsquo;s highschool friend Mikako lives.  (Due to their friendship, I
worked with Mikako for a bit at a language school.  She&rsquo;s quite
bilingual and pretty cool for a girl ;-))   If this happens, I figure
I&rsquo;ll do it during Golden Week next year, especially if there are more
than a few days off in a week.  I haven&rsquo;t looked yet.  I guess it will
take about 8 days to walk.  (Rough estimate by breaking Google Maps
suggestion into 8 hour chunks per day.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His reply:</p>

<pre><code>Sounds like quite a plan!  What is the furthest/longest you have walked
(barefoot) so far?  Perhaps it would be wise, for health reasons, to try
a shorter (25%?) trip before committing to such a long one.
</code></pre>

<p>What?  Plan ahead??</p>

<p>Well, since I&rsquo;m just futzing around before class, which is <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> the
length of Seaside Line away from here, perhaps I can walk to class
now.  I know it&rsquo;s not <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of the way to Niigata, but it&rsquo;s more than
1/100th!</p>

<p>From here to Niigata is 74 hours on foot.  From here to work is 1.25
hours on foot.</p>

<h2 id="14-48">14:48</h2>

<p>Aw man, it&rsquo;s raining!</p>

<p>(And I have no rain cover for my backpack, the only part of me that&rsquo;s
not waterproof.)</p>

<p>Hugo is picky about the date format.  It&rsquo;s gotta look like this
2016-09-28T13:13:05+09:00 which I&rsquo;m sure is a named standard, but I
don&rsquo;t know the name.</p>

<p>Right now, after reverting an old commit in which I <em>removed</em> a lot of
dates because Middleman couldn&rsquo;t deal with dates after 3pm, I have 245
dates which Hugo cannot parse.</p>

<p>I copied and truncated each line from the list of errors from Hugo&rsquo;s
output, and have 245 lines like these three:</p>

<pre><code>'2005-09-26 20:08:51' in page ~/journal/2005/09/26themes.md
'2005-09-26 18:19:56' in page ~/journal/2005/09/26wordpress.md
'2005-10-14 15:30:09' in page ~/journal/2005/10/14general-relativity-versus-newton.md
</code></pre>

<p>Time for some emacs macros to fix them up.</p>

<p>I subbed for Matt again this week.  Each class had one more student
than last week, so I guess that was a good sign.  I talked about neti
with one of the students who was suffering from allergies.</p>

<p>We imagined luxurious vacations in both classes. &ldquo;They will fly to
Italy to eat pizza&rdquo; and &ldquo;they would fly in a hot air balloon&rdquo; are
examples of the grammar structures used in each class.</p>

<p>I came to CoCoIchiban curry place because the others I&rsquo;ve visited
featured electric outlets where my computer can sip the sweet sweet AC
it craves from time to time.</p>

<p>I asked the waitress コンセントがありますか and she was like, &ldquo;?????&rdquo;

<p>Bluh computer work kinda sucked today; I spent 5 hours on one thing
and 3.5 hours on a different thing and made almost 0 progress on
them.  The second thing was futzing around with .htaccess file, and
for 2.5 of the 3.5 hours it actually wasn&rsquo;t being read. <em>facepalm</em> I
needed to AllowOverride All in the Apache2 directives&hellip;  but do I
want to do that on live server?  I wonder if it&rsquo;s already on our live
server?  Anyway, once I got Apache to actually look at the file, I
made an inch of progress, but nothing like what I had hoped.  Blarg.</p>

<p>I taught a lesson this morning for Matt in Marunochi.  Three students,
relatively high level.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s my report on the lesson:</p>

<pre>
Topics included introductions (given that it was our first lesson
together), differences in culture between the US and Japan, and (after
the women left at 8:55 for an accounting class,) finance.

The students did not have any books nor topics, so it might be
valuable to have something available to give a bit of direction to the
class.

New vocab included
Inclusive, exclusive, trunk, branch

Seems like a pretty great class; I'd be happy to sub there again.

yesterday, knowing that I have to wake up earlier than normal to teach
a lesson for Matt who is at home in UK at the moment.  Train is at
6:29, so I plan to leave the house at 6am.</p>

<p>After teaching in the morning, I pretty much spent all day playing
with Ansible.  I now have a vagrant installation that sets up ansible,
git, and
emacs on a vagrant box on my local machine which creates an ssh
keypair (half of which I manually copy to bitbucket).  I run setup and
it pulls in a git repo and runs setup on that, which asks for an
ansible-vault passphrase to unlock my AWS keys and gives me ansible
playbooks which I can run to set up VPC + subnet + internet gateway on
AWS, launch an ubuntu instance in the subnet, and install git on it.</p>

<p>Next steps will be to set up git the way I like (.aliases for gitl,
gitd, gits), install apache2 (to replicate existing box), set up a
couple of websites, including redmine.</p>

<p>At that point, (I will have to get from backup my redmine data, and
<em>then</em>) I will have replicated a box on AWS with Ansible!  Thank you,
Travis, for the initial idea, and thank you, Ansible team, for
Ansible, and thank you Justin for helping me set up Ansible on
vagrant!

<p>I hereby promise to release the repos once I&rsquo;ve cleansed all the
references to my workplace! (hopefully someone will still find it
useful by then!)
from Ansible by then hahaha)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m working with Ansible again today.  I&rsquo;m creating a set of three
repos.  One sets up a vagrant box on my local machine and then clones
the second repo inside the machine.</p>

<p>The second repo will set up VPC and subnet and internet gateway on AWS
then spin up a box in a public subnet.  It will clone the third repo
on that box.</p>

<p>The third repo will set up boxes for my other clients on AWS, on both
public and private subnet.</p>

<p>Right now as I write, I&rsquo;m letting <code>vagrant up</code> finish for the first
time after splitting my one repo which is now the first two repos
described above.  The box has finished starting so now I need to look
inside and make sure it all looks right.</p>

<p>Awww oops. I got a bit too zealous with my extraction.  Need to move
my ansible-crypt files back to the first repo.</p>

<p>Actually it&rsquo;s fine.  It makes sense to have the AWS keys in the same
repo that will first talk to AWS.</p>

<p>Great fun at Suns Out Guns Out on Sunday.  It was a bit rainy, but I&rsquo;m
waterpoof so it was just fine.  We worked out for 90 minutes then had
lunch then played ultimate for a while.  Great great great!  I brought
my new purple disc and it got its first scuffs on Sunday.</p>

<p>The next day boom I felt sick.  I thought I was just sore from workout
but I had a bit of a fever.  Fortunately my Monday morning lesson had
been moved to today due to holiday yesterday.  Unfortunately, we ended
up cancelling I-group due to not enough people attending.</p>

<p>I pretty much slept all day and all night and felt pretty much better
this morning for morning lesson near Akabanebashi station.</p>

<p>Went back home and slept some hours before lessons tonight.</p>

<p>As I left the house, Jennie bolted out the door despite the little
fact that it was raining.  Aw man, and no one home to let her back in
when she realizes how much fun it isn&rsquo;t to be cold and wet.  Hopefully
she&rsquo;ll be okay.</p>

<p>Fred got his Minecraft account set up and I directed him to
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/deltaminecraft">Delta</a>.  We may play tonight
if I can get home in time.</p>

<p>Actually as I write this, I&rsquo;m on the local train, specifically because
I wanted to sit down to write a bit in my journal.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten a good start on moving all my websites&rsquo; content to their
own new users, but a couple of them are broken; specifically
robnugen.com/cgi-bin/journal.pl doesn&rsquo;t work anymore.  I guess it&rsquo;s
because not all the files got copied over.  I think it used some files
that were outside the webroot, so didn&rsquo;t get copied when Dreamhost
moved all robnugen.com&rsquo;s files over to new user.</p>

<p>Mayumi gave me a new puzzle recently.  It&rsquo;s Hanayama&rsquo;s Vortex: three
chrome plated cast iron pieces which fit together in a kindof spiral
shape.  She gave me the puzzle pieces all separated and I refused to
accept the answer sheet from her.  I figured out what it must look
like when finished, but I haven&rsquo;t yet figured out how to get them
together.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll work on it a bit now.</p>
