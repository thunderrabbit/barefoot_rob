<p>It's been great being back home.  Janette made me chicken soup with
real chicken; I was all, "so that's what's been taking so long to heat
up a can of soup!  You're not heating up a can of soup!"  She made a
blackberry pie and I got to roll out the top crust and write BLACK
BERIES with a fork poking holes in the top and then realized I had
missed an R so I made an R with an arrow pointing to its place.</p>

<p>Joel, Kally (sp), Brent came by on their way to see <em>Bowling For
Columbine</em>.  They chatted a bit while Joel ate ice cream, pie,
chicken soup.</p>

<p>Earlier today I tried to set up an addressbook application on my
server so I can keep all my contacts on my webserver where the backups
will be maintained for me.  Basically so I can lose my computer and
not lose all my friends' phone numbers and such.  I manually exported
the info from my Palm Desktop app here and used emacs to format it
with | delimeters.  But when I moved the resulting file to my site, it
didn't seem to like it.  Treated the whole thing as one record.  Kudos
to Perl for not breaking on such a long string, but d'oh that I don't
know why it's not working the way I wanted..</p>

<p>Now Janette and I are going to watch <em>Monsoon Wedding</em> which
we've both heard is an excellent movie.</p>

<p class=date>11:20pm</p>

<p>It was alright.  I'm glad the dad kicked that bad cat out to
protect the family.</p>

<p>Ug.</p>

<p>I have a headache to beat all headaches and snotty nose to beat all
snotty noses.  Actually it's more clogged up than snotty.  Just ug.
All snot is clear, so I don't think I'm sick, I just feel like shit though.</p>

<p class=date>4:20am</p>

<p>Just gargled some super salty warm saltwater.  Back to bed.</p>

<p class=date>9:12am</p>

<p>Awake now.</p>

<p>Around 6am, I got up to pee and I started to feel weird and
realized I was about to pass out.  Passing out while peeing could be
messy, so I forced/willed myself to not pass out, at least not all the
way.  It was close.  Finished peeing, carefully lowered my body to
fetal position on the floor, with my head down.  Most weirdest
uncomfortable nauseating feeling washed over me, and then went away.
I could feel sweat had gushed out my forehead.  Relaxed; waited for
everything to feel normal again.  Turned onto my back, and propped my
feet up on the wall, encouraging blood to visit my brain more than my
legs.  I could hear Maggie turning on her shower through the wall.</p>

<p>Once I felt stable, I got up, went back to bed.</p>

<p>Dad called around 7:30 or 8 to confirm that he chose not to see
Fred and I this weekend; Dad's schedule is all packed and such.  I
told him I already understood yesterday that he wouldn't be able to
see us.  He said that yesterday he was tentatively, but now he's
confirmedly too busy.</p>

<p>Feeling physically much better now.  Also I got a great email from
Ben Horne, a cool ex-DJ at Rice who is now in Kryzgstan or some
country, the name of which I've never previously heard.</p>

<p>Also got a phone number for Ricky Shaw! He's the ex-manager of Shaw
Chevron, excellent cheerleader for me for all my college years at
UH.</p>

<p>Chillin' at Dr Nellie Grose's office.  Hmm I thought I would get
here early, but I was a couple minutes late.</p>

<p>Ah well.</p>

<p class=date>11:55am</p>

<p>Talked to Dr Nellie and somehow she already knew I was going to
Japan.  I dunno how she knew.  She answered questions for me, actually
just suggested resources for how I can answer them, said I'd be quite
happy and well taken care of in Japan.</p>

<p>About passing out, she gave a few possible reasons, after she first
explained that passing out is the body's way of stabilizing blood
pressure and getting blood to the brain.  Could be caused from low
blood sugar, something else, something else, something else, being too
hot..  </p>

<p>I was all, "that's probably it.  I was wearing this [undies, pants,
shirt, hoodie] and in my sleeping bag to sleep."</p>

<p>She guessed that my blood pressure was much lower than normal to
keep from overheating, and when I got up, I didn't do so slowly and my
blood pressure didn't get pumped back up in time.</p>

<p>I like that explanation.</p>

<p>She listened to my lungs and checked my ears and tonsils.  "You
have very pretty teeth."  (Wow!, thanks!)  Patted me on the back,
"you're fine."</p>

<p>Told her how I've been learning to release my stuff and allow the
universe to provide all that I need.  She gave me a big hug for that.
"Be sure to send me a card."</p>

<p>I will.</p>

<p>I'm on the way back home in Dallas and just found my phone.  It was
on the floor between the driver seat and door.  Hmmmm.  I haven't
heard back from Wende that she cancelled it; I wonder what I'll decide
to do.</p>

<p>I will definitely get Lee-eh's phone number from its memory.</p>

<p>The front of my mouthguard broke off.  It had cracked during the
night, and I kept it in.  Now the front edge broke, leaving a serrated
edge for me to slice my tongue if it's not careful.</p>

<p>I'm glad I'm in Houston, where my dentist is located.</p>

HI Dad

I am in the process of closing my cell phone account, so unless
something surprising happens with that process, I won't have a cell
phone again until I get to Japan.

I called your home number to let you know and Karen answered, and
ultimately invited me to call you at work.  I chose not to bug you at
work over such a little thing, so I called her back, asking if she'd
let you know.  She didn't seem too happy about my having called back,
but said she would be glad to pass that bit of information on.

I do not love Karen enough to have a clearing with her, letting her
know that I feel negative energy every time I talk to her.

I do love you enough to let you know that I feel distance between you
and I since you've been with Karen.

Ironically, I'm doubly not going to call you at work to dump this on
you now, nor am I going to call Karen back to have her pass this
message on to you.

I feel really sad and just had a good cry.

    I love you
    - Rob

<p>Just finished at the Dr Chisholm DDS office.  He fixed my
mouthguard free of charge.  Awww yeah.  I was all "now this is
excellent customer service" none of this, "are you going to see Wende
[in California] anytime soon?"</p>

<p>Jessica the assistant told me about her upcoming trip to Panama,
her home country, and how some of her friends were all worried cause
apparently some Americans got kidnapped there, or are missing or
something.  She was all, "I'm going anyway; I know where to go and be
safe."</p>

<p>I even got a new mouthguard case, just in case.  Different color so
I can easily remember which one contains my mouthguard.</p>
