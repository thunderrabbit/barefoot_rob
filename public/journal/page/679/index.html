<h3>1997 OKC rally as seen through the eyes of Dane Dormio.</h3>
</center>
<hr>
We left as soon as we could Friday and stopped in Conway to pick up
Meghan Rose and Nick Grunewald.  Meghan had hurt her knee really bad
in a soccer game right after the Little Rock rally, but she was
almost healed and only had to use crutches a little.  Nick was hyper
and kept us all awake whenever he was around us.  After the rally my
mom said she had given him his Ritalin every time he was supposed
to take it, but my sister still complained.  Meghan put her hurt leg
across Nick&rsquo;s lap and mine, so besides Nick&rsquo;s antics I had a foot
fetish to indulge to help stave off boredom.
<p>
When we stopped at a gas station, Nick bought a cap gun and a bunch
of caps.  It took us about seven hours to get there, and we were only
about forty-five minutes to an hour from the church when we stopped.<br />
We had lost the map our hosts had so kindly drawn for us, so my mom
called Debbie Barnes at the church to get directions.  We got there
without any problems, except that Nick&rsquo;s el cheapo cap gun had broken
before we were half way there, but he could still shoot it, a
situation which my sister would remedy shortly upon our arrival by
tearing it apart into several separate components.
<p>
We arrived just after Fayetville, and it was them and the OKC people
that we saw first.  I affectionately said hi to Mellissa
Cain, Suzanne Kelly, Tiffany Schneider, Erin Bailey, Kitty Rankin,
Austin Roth, and Sean Murray, then did the same to the youth from
Fayetville and their advisor, Tera Little, showing off my bottle of
bubbles that I had saved from SWUUSI. (This bottle happened to be
well known) I was  really surprised to see Gavin Robins from
Fayetville, whom I had not seen since SWUUSI &lsquo;95.  He had cut off his
midback-long hair  and I was pissed.  I went inside and registered,
because it was cold, and the way touch groups were being marked was
with nail polish.  After getting my middle finger painted purple, I
ran around exchanging hugs and kisses and licks with all my friends.<br />
I found Charlotte Benbeneck-Price and did the same with her, and
after getting our picture taken together we headbanged to &ldquo;Portrait
of an American Family&rdquo; by Marilyn Manson with a few other fans until
that activity was ceased by a combination of dizziness, fatigue,
headache, requests to turn the music off, and the arrival of new
people.
<p>
I wore my White Zombie shirt with the devil on the front and &ldquo;I
went to Hell and all I got was this crummy tee-shirt&rdquo; on the back
that I got in trouble for at school.  It got plenty of laughs.  Keith
and Tia Lawlor arrived from Austin shortly and after them Bryan
Beck and Curtis Mcormack from San Antonio, but Curtis went to sleep
as soon as he came in, and I didn&rsquo;t see him until Saturday morning.<br />
Anna Magwood, Megan Holt, and Nick Carter were among the last people
to arrive and when they came in I met Anna&rsquo;s dad, Jim.  He is 6&rsquo;5 and
about 300 pounds.  I talked to him later and found out that he is a
cool guy.  He was not at all critical or biased, the way a lot of
adults I meet are.  A great UU.  He is from Canada, and he and his
family moved to Houston two (I think) years ago.  He has a degree in
paleontology and went to someplace in the arctic to do studies as a
post-graduate.
<p>
James Meine was the last person I remember arriving, a half hour
later than he should have because of car trouble not to far from the
church.  He bit my neck and said that he was going to collapse, which
is very out-of-character for him, especially on Friday night.
<p>
Opening circle was not the best ever, not very organized or official.
It broke up quickly.  I was disappointed that Dallas didn&rsquo;t show up,
but there was still a pretty good turnout; about fifty or sixty
youths and I think a total of 68, including advisors.
<p>
The general partying continued all night.  In the church&rsquo;s high
school room, which was supposed to be a 24-hour music-party-hangout
room, but which later turned into a thickly cushioned
sleep-workshop-movie room, several movies were played, including
&ldquo;Army of Darkness&rdquo;, which has to be the STUPIDEST movie I have ever
seen.  I spoofed it along with everyone else in the room, Anna&rsquo;s feet
resting in my lap and enjoying a massage.  I fell asleep during the
last half of that movie, and please forgive me, but I actually got a
few hours of sleep Friday night.  I never have slept on Friday night
before, but there wasn&rsquo;t anything better to do, so I thought I might
as well.
<p>
After breakfast, the morning workshops started.  I went to tie-dyeing
and tie-dyed some of my underwear.  This may sound weird, but now
when I&rsquo;m in the locker room in P.E. I can go, &ldquo;Hey guys, look at my
tie-dyed underwear.&rdquo;  Tia and Charlotte used the dye on their
hair.  There was also a halo-making workshop and there was supposed
to be a full contact monopoly game played with four big long
styrofoam &ldquo;noodles&rdquo;, but this didn&rsquo;t happen because everybody just
wanted to run around smacking each other with the noodles.  When I
was finished tie-dyeing, I had a noodle fight with Mike Moren, and
although I hate to brag, I must say that I kicked his ass, although
fair blows were exchanged both ways.  By the time we truced the
halo-making workshop was finished and Anna gave me a halo she had
made to wear as a victory crown.
<p>
Lunch was subs, because of the theme, &ldquo;The Rocky Horror Subway Show&rdquo;.
I rolled around and snuggled and visited until later that evening,
when I went into the high school room and laid down with Anna and
lazily spoofed some Bruce Lee movie, &ldquo;The China Connection&rdquo;, I think.
It was dubbed, and I don&rsquo;t really know what it was about, except a
couple of kung fu schools getting really pissed at each other and
really fake-looking fighting with Bruce Lee against everybody,
kicking multiple asses at once, and it was also the STUPIDEST movie I
had ever watched.
<p>
When it was getting to be dinner time, around five or six, Melissa,
who was my touch group leader, came to tear me away to do dinner
prep.  We were the only two people in the touch group to actually go
into the kitchen and work, but we had plenty of volunteer help, so it
was alright.  We made garlic bread, various microwave lasagnas, and
brownies for desert, so I got to lick the bowl with Heidi Bickner and
my sister.  Dinner was scheduled for six, but it was not finally
ready until 7:10, which seemed like it was bad because the contra
dancers were coming at 7:30, but it was really ok, some people ate
while some people danced.
<p>
I thought contra dancing (don&rsquo;t ask me why they call it that) would
be something exotic, but it was actually just square dancing, which I
guess is somewhat exotic, or at least unusual, to me because I have
not square danced since the time our school made us do it in the
fourth or fifth grade.  Rob Nugen&rsquo;s girlfriend Wende, a young woman
whom I thought I would never see again after she was a visitor at
Houston but whom I was pleasantly surprised to see at OKC and find
out she was an advisor so I would get to see her many more times,
asked me to dance with her, and I did even though I didn&rsquo;t have any
desire to except for maybe a small inkling, but I did because she
asked me to and if I asked somebody to dance it would really spoil my
fun if they said no, and I wanted to do something nice for Wende,
because I wasn&rsquo;t against dancing either, I just needed  a little
motivation, and damnit, I had a lot of fun square dancing, and I
don&rsquo;t care if you or anybody else likes it or not, something I didn&rsquo;t
have to worry about among my YRUU friends, and I think that was why I
really enjoyed it, that I would enjoy almost anything I do with them.
(Man, that was a long sentence)  The contra dancers had a band and a
bunch of dancers to guide, and one of the woman dancers, who reminded
me of a transvestite, Danielle, in my fellowship, had this loose
dress that would fly up way too far whenever she would twirl and you
could see her butt and everything.
<p>
They stayed until after eleven, but I only danced for a comparatively
short period of time and after I quit I sat on the floor with Anna
and Jim and Wendy and watched.  While Anna was listening to a discman
and couldn&rsquo;t hear us, the cover of the Romeo and Juliet soundtrack
made Jim think of the time when Anna had been going on about how
great Leonardo Dicaprio was and her grandfather had asked why, he was
such a dork, and Anna had gone off on him, so Jim told me about it.<br />
Then the same picture reminded me of my Incredible Hulk
impersonation, so I showed it to them.
<p>
I saw Bill Loden and Bethany Manning, a rally virgin from Fayetville,
together, and they seemed like they had known each other for a long
time.  This didn&rsquo;t seem very likely at all, so I asked Bill, and he
said no, he had just &ldquo;gotten a feeling&rdquo; that he should know her,
which would sound weird coming from anyone else but Bill, because
Bill is a very wise and spiritually developed person, like his mom.<br />
By the way, this rally was the one-year anniversary of the day Bill
quit smoking.
<p>
After the contra dancers left, Rob started a physical game, crab tag,
and it mutated into several variations of tag, until I suggested
we play Link, a tag game involving pairs of people linking and
unlinking.  At a point when James and I were linked, we took a break
to get some of Bill and Cathy Saur&rsquo;s birthday cake.  Their birthdays
were both on the same day, I think Saturday.  I accidentally dropped
my cake and got icing on Joanna&rsquo;s sleeping bag, but it was alright
because I licked most of it off.  About this time, (Kitty) Kat came
back, because she had left for work at five, and she had lost her
voice.
<p>
The talent show was the next event, and it was good even though it
was in the sanctuary, which was cold.  It got to me after a while, so
Anna and I got under my jacket to warm up.  Although it was an
exceptionally great talent show with a lot of original acts, like
poems and songs by Rob and Samantha doing a perfect moonwalk in a
dance, sleep was constantly nagging at me until I was brought back
instantly from the edge of consciousness by Steve asking if anyone
knew the words to &ldquo;Dead Puppies&rdquo;, a fairly exclusive bit of knowledge
which I possess and am proud of.  I always jump at the chance to sing
&ldquo;Dead Puppies&rdquo;, especially since there is little competition because
the song seems all but forgotten, a situation which I will take time
to remedy.  So Brian and I sang &ldquo;Dead Puppies&rdquo; with Steve playing and
singing backup.  Steve also played his classic, &ldquo;Rocky Racoon&rdquo;, and a
few others before &ldquo;Dead Puppies&rdquo; which I was not awake for.
<p>
I went to worship at eleven, right after the talent show, which was
put on by Austin, who is a good worship coordinator.  It was a
foot-washing, thought-sharing worship.  Nick Carter and I washed each
other&rsquo;s feet.  When we had all shared our thoughts and meditations on
washing feet, we sang a pagan chant:  &ldquo;We are a circle, within a
circle, with no beginning, and never ending&rdquo; and had a big long group
hug.  We were so emotional, you would have thought we were about to
say goodbye if you didn&rsquo;t know any better.  It just goes to show the
power of a good foot washing.
<p>
&ldquo;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&rdquo; was supposed to play downstairs at
midnight, but it turned out to be two.  Melissa and Suzanne and
Tiffany dressed up for it in various outfits which showed their legs,
and I guess they were embarassed about their legs, especially
Tiffany, because I saw them in the hall a few times, and every time
they would duck behind a corner, and when I went to ask them what
they were doing, they would run giggling and screaming into the
girl&rsquo;s bathroom.  I was going to watch the movie, but I knew I
wouldn&rsquo;t be able to stay awake for it, and since there were no
comfortable places to go to sleep downstairs, I skipped it and
wandered around, occasionally running into a small group of people
who were still awake.
<p>
I floated around on bits and peices of drowsy conversation with the
stragglers, and put all the left over brownie crumbs in a bowl and
poured milk over them to eat them.  They didn&rsquo;t make me as sick as I
thought they would.  Finally, about an hour and a half before wake
up, which was at the usual time of six a.m., I decided to go to the
high school room and find a mattress to lay down on and go to sleep.<br />
And then, twenty minutes later, I got around to staggering out there
through the cold for an hour&rsquo;s sleep before cleaning up.
<p>
But my hour of sleep was not to be.  No, it mutated into two hours
and forty-seven minutes of sleep.  I woke up and looked around to
find everyone else still asleep.  It didn&rsquo;t think I had woken up
early, so I looked at my watch and it said 7:47.  We were almost two
hours late!  I quickly went back into the main building to find out
from somebody what was going, a failed effort because there was
nobody awake to find out from, ok though because it was pretty
self-explanatory at this point.  Nobody had woken up!  No problem, it
was but a matter of minutes until Debbie was running around with a
whistle and screaming and kicking people.  I went back out to the
high school room to wake people up and tell them we were late, then
went back inside to wake people and clean up in there.  A while
later, before Debbie had gotten there, I went to the high school room
again and found that hardly anybody had gotten up.  So I warned them,
&ldquo;Get up quick or Debbie will come out here blowing a whistle and
screaming and kicking people!&ldquo;, but no sooner had I uttered the words
than I heard a now-familiar shrill sound and imperative yet cheery
voice, and a few seconds later my prophecy came true when Debbie
burst through the door.  I evacuated immediately and went to the main
building again to clean up.  I donated the fondly remembered bubbles
from SWUUSI to the church, because someone had lost the lid, and
the huge jug was just about empty anyway.  Since we were late,
everyone busted their asses and we got finished with time to spare.<br />
<p>
At closing circle we did &ldquo;Dead Puppies&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bish-Bish&rdquo; and got
mugbooks, which were not nearly as good as Little Rock&rsquo;s I thought,
but were not the worst I&rsquo;ve seen.  Bryan gave out his new copies of
the &ldquo;Yackity-Yac&rdquo;, with the rally review of Little Rock and dates of
rallies and SWUUSI until San Antonio next year.  Breakfast was
assorted doughnuts, which are always better than plain glazed
doughnuts, and there were plenty left over when most of the people
left.  I think we were the last to leave.  I thought I would never
get done saying goodbye.  I enjoy every rally more than the last one,
which never seems possible at the time, but I can tell I am still
growing and changing, and I can&rsquo;t wait for Ft. Worth in May.
<p></p>

<p>Love and Everything,<br>

                        <p class=date>13 March 1997</p>

<p>I just got back from my latest Wild Skating Adventure.</p>

<p>Starting from my apartment, I skated over to Empire Cafe' to meet Diane, one
of my skater buds.  We chatted for a bit while I got some water and then she
got on her skates and we went.  We did not really have a destination in mind
except maybe to skate along Fannin street to find some lilies for Wende, who
is returning tomorrow at 9am from Hawaii!  (I'm totally excited about that.)</p>

<p>Diane and I went down a street called Hazard, which is actually quite a nice
smoothly paved asphalt street.  Toward Hermann Park we skated, and rested at
a cool fountain surrounded by a ring of Roman column looking things.  I went
flying around the fountain, working hard to stay on the ring of steps, and I
found that the columns alternately blocked and allowed the sound of splashes
to reach my ears, causing a cool audio effect that reminded me of some song.</p>

<p>We rested there for a while, then skated toward the Medical Center.  The
coolest thing was being essentially right underneath the Life Flight helicopter
as it took off, blowing leaves and dust everywhere!  We skated a bit down 
Fannin, while I swerved around the various obstacles in the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Then to Rice University, where we skated up into the stadium.  Diane took off
her skates and ran the bleachers and around the field while I skated around to
the other side of the stadium to find out why I heard people cheering over 
there, but could see no lights.</p>

<p>I found people yelling encouraging cheers to some bicyclists, who were possibly
practicing for some marathon.  The track was lit with headlights of cars aimed
along the track in the direction they were biking.  Pretty cool.  It made me
nostalgic for my college days.<p>

<p>Back around to the other side, where Diane was just putting on her skates after
running the length of the field and around the track 3 times or so.  Wow.
I decided it would be a good idea to skate down the steps to the field and then
run up the steps.  I found it was not a good idea to skate down, so I carefully
walked down, sometimes waving my arms wildly to stay balanced.  
Made it to the bottom and then ran up clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk
all the way to the top without missing a beat (or a step).  That was cool.</p>

<p>We watched some guys practice hitting some baseballs in a batting net (like a 
batting cage, except it's a net) for a while and then cruised.</p>

<p>Rolled around the super smooth asphalt parking lot and then decided it was
about time to get back.  On the way back, however (still well within Rice
campus), a Bronco or Blazer or something drove by with about 20 people piled
into it.  Wow.  They drove past us- and had about a 150 foot lead on me
(plus 15 miles per hour) when I decided to catch them.  I just took off- 
skated as fast as I could for probably a bit over 100 yards.  I honestly
wouldn't have caught them except that they stopped for the stop sign.
Woah- I had trouble stopping quite in time; I ended up beside the truck.
As they drove off, I latched onto the back, in which were sitting four people
crammed side by side.   I was fully out of breath, unable to say anything like,
"HI!  I'm Rob.  I like to skate."  They pretty much didn't say anything either,
just snickered at a crazy skater who would latch onto their truck for no
reason.  The driver smiled and waved at me in the mirror, and just continued
on as if I weren't there.   They pulled me all the way to the stadium and I
let go just as they turned to where it got really rocky and wet.  "See ya
later!" I called, thinking that was a silly thing to say.</p>

<p>Still totally winded, I headed back toward where I had left Diane with 
essentially no warning.  She had skated about a third of the way I had been 
pulled when I met up with her.  Still totally winded, I said, "I had to do
that.  Thank you."</p>

<p>We cruised back toward Empire Cafe, by way of Hazard most of the way.  Diane
offered to drive me home, but I felt like I wanted to skate.  I'm glad I did
because as I skated by the people chillin' outside, Eric saw me and said HI.
The crazy thing is that Eric is the guy who owned the ramp that I jumped and
busted my head without a helmet.  Wow!  It's been probably a year since I had
seen him, and I actually didn't remember at first who he was.   (See <a href="/skate/skate06.html">Wild 
Skating Adventure Six</a>, which describes that accident.)   I continued on my
way and saw John, who owns the Montrose Skate Shop, where I buy all my skating
equipment!  I said HI to him for a bit and then continued on.</p>

<p>I had a brief non-contact interaction with a car that turned where I didn't
expect, so I cranked a turn out into the street to avoid him as he locked
his brakes.  Fortunately the street was pretty much empty, and I just skated 
across the street and up the curb to a parking lot.  No problem.</p>

<p>Skated the rest of the way home and here I am.</p>

                        <p class=date>8 March 1997</p>

<p>Today is a wonderful Saturday, and I spontaneously decided this morning to 
skate.  Started at my apartment,  through the intersection which is no longer
under construction, down Taft to Allen Parkway (where the light didn't agree
with me so I had to go slowly through the intersection) and toward downtown.</p>

<p>I skated gently to Jones Plaza, where I was surprised to find some guys
digging a trench through one side of the block.  Turns out they had dug down
to the top of the parking garage, which had sprung a leak inside, to fix the
leak.  Cool.  They had simply unearthed a seam in the garage ceiling and were
squishing down into the seam pink styrofoam noodles, which they would later
cover with tar or something.</p>

<p>Then I followed my skates to Market Square, where traffic was blocked for
BrewFest, and giant marketing thing with lots of barbecue and beer.  Wow.
I was super excited.  They had set up lots of cones and barriers and all
sorts of fun obstacles just for me to skate around!</p>

<p>That got boring after a while, so I skated to University of Houston Downtown
campus, where I watched the construction dudes deconstruct their scaffolding
after completing part of the construction on which they had been working.
Then I skated super fast down the hill and then toward The Wortham, where I
met two people just putting on their skates.  They are Emily and Chad, and
were skating for about the third time.</p>

<p>Emily was not too excited about skating in the streets, so I suggested we
go to Jones Plaza, where the top surface is nice and smooth and a great
place to practice.   I taught her and Chad how to use their brakes to stop 
easily, while I goofed around with my frisbee and around the trees and short
walls.  They got much better in a short amount of time, and then we went to 
the BrewFest to poke around.  We looked around a bit, and then they had to
leave so I gave 'em my number and we parted ways.</p>

<p>I skated pretty quickly to Hermann Park, about 5 or 6 miles away.  I first 
went to the 5000 lb. granite sphere that is supported by a teensy thin layer
of water, allowing it to be spun any direction.  The plaque was missing (again)
so I told the few people who seemed interested that it was not just "pretty
heavy," it was 5000 pounds.</p>

<p>Then to Miller Outdoor Theater, to skate down the hill while watching for cars
and pedestrian traffic, and navigating some stout wooden posts and parked cars 
at the bottom.  I had watched for cars coming from left to right, and realized
I had neglected to watch for cars coming from right to left when I ended up in
their lane at the bottom.  Fortunately, there had been none, whether I watched
them or not.</p>

<p>Then to the zoo area, where there is a large steam locomotive heavily rusting
behind an iron fence.  Today, however, there were some guys working on it.  I
went to investigate, and it turns out that anyone can volunteer time or money
to the restoration of this locomotive!  I will be there next Saturday, I told
Stan, who told me about their efforts.  (If anyone in Houston is interested,
they meet at about 9am Saturday, weather permitting.  Bring hammers, crowbars,
paint brushes or any basic tools you may have.)</p>

<p>I skated a bit around the lake, racing the small train as it traveled through
the park.  I found a point where I could wait until the end of the train had
passed me, then skate fast fast fast and beat the train at the next intersection
with the sidewalk.  (Note, however, two things.  (1) I didn't actually cross
in front of the train; I just made sure I was going fast enough to do it. 
(2) It's a small train, like the ones you see in parks)  I chose not to be a
bad influence for the little kids who were watching.</p>

<p>Skated back to the theater, to skate down the hill once more.  I watched for
cars and people coming from both directions this time.  No problem.</p>

<p>By then, I was pretty tired, so I went home and took a nap.</p>

<p><p class=note>(transcribed out of my diary)</p>
<p>
Sunday night Wende and I drove to Denton to harass Fred in class Monday.
<p>
We played 2 versions of the Alphabet Game (*) and had wonderful conversation on the way up there.  I don&rsquo;t remember what we talked about, but it was great.
<p>
Once we got there, I essentially fell asleep immediately after we got back from shopping for milk, OJ &amp; pizza.  I ate one slice then slept.
<p>
Woke up and went to Fred&rsquo;s class.  Tamara was all nervous that it wouldn&rsquo;t work just right.  It was perfect.  I sat in the back with some dudes.  Test day and one of them was all, &ldquo;you gonna take the test?&rdquo;  <br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just gonna put some bullshit down.&rdquo;<br>
He&rsquo;s all, &ldquo;oh.&rdquo;<br>
I know he wanted to get answers from me.
<p>
Test was pretty easy pre-algebra.  I solved for 5 in (3x - 4) / (2x - 5) = (4x - 3) / 5 or something, and I drew a picture on the page.
<p>
The bonus was &ldquo;describe how to solve inequalities using absolute values.&rdquo;  I wrote, &ldquo;absolute values such as absolute love or absolute compassion for one&rsquo;s fellow man would solve all racial inequalities.&rdquo;
<p>
When class was doen, Fred went to his class and Wende graded the exams and I surfed and walked around campus.  When Fred was done, me Wende, G, Tamara all played frisbee and ran around and went to the Flying Tomato and harassed the guy behind the counter.  The girl behind the counter had amazing blue eyes and smile.
<p>
Went to a store filled with books and bells and crystals and drums and positive energy and all sorts of cool stuff.  Wende bought a cute wiggly toe ring and I enjoyed a $350 drum for a while.
<p>
Drove Fred&rsquo;s car a bit during that time and then went to the park.  They had a cool-ass swing set thing..  The top portion would spin!  We spun the girls who were sitting and screaming and Wende got sick to her stomach.  We got &lsquo;em going &lsquo;round pretty fast and pretty high.
<p>
Climbed all over a bridge-connected slide set and made up a game where you couldn&rsquo;t switch walls easily no tag people not on your wall. It was a crazy game.
<p>
We lay on the sidewalk to rest and talk.
<p>
Went back to Tamara&rsquo;s.
<p>
Slept from 5pm to 7pm and then drove home.</p>

                        <p class=date>1 March 1997</p>

<p>Last night I skated hard for the first time in a long time.  It had been since
Thanksgiving of last year, so my endurance was low.  But I still had fun.</p>

<p>I started from my apartment, skating down the street to where it's all under
construction.  Watching traffic patterns carefully, calculating trajectories
and the reactions of drivers, I rolled smoothly between the barrels and 
between the cars, then accelerated toward oncoming traffic in a blocked-off
section of street.  I slowed a bit to let the last of a wave of cars veer left
out of my way, then shot out into the street pushing hard toward the next 
intersection which held back the next wave of cars.  I did not quite make it
to the gap in the median before they came, so I had to squeeze myself between
the oncoming cars and the curb for just a *second* before I reached the
opening in the median for me to cross the street.  Looking behind me I noted
the cars had just been let across the intersection from which I just came.
I pushed harder and made my right turn at the second intersection before they
reached me.  Success.</p>

<p>I relatively leisurely skated down Dallas Street, catching my breath, and
wondering if Allen Parkway would be blocked off yet for the street festival to
be held there the next day.   I reached Taft and turned left toward Allen 
Parkway.</p>

<p>The hill leading down to Allen Parkway on Taft is a pretty fun one to skate.
Taft goes down the hill, stopping at Allen Parkway to form a T intersection.
The traffic going from right to left on Allen Parkway never has to stop at this
intersection, so even if you time the light correctly, there still is traffic 
to navigate.</p>

<p>This time, I start at the top of the hill, push push push push push push down
down faster faster faster, watching the light for cross traffic turn yellow
then red, and then green light for me (yay!) as I fly into the intersection, 
up onto the median for an instant before I cross the nonstop flow of traffic 
and see there's only one car and plenty of room so I fly off the curb, cross 
the street (watch the light post) up the curb, cut my turn harder to keep 
from tumbling over the guard rail into the ravine.  Made it.  
Perfect.</p>

<p>Skated slowly up the sidewalk/trail along Allen Parkway till I reached downtown
Houston.</p>

<p>Turned left on some street, went a ways then left on another street which I
knew would take me down toward the other side of Allen Parkway.  The light was
holding back the cars that wanted to use my same hill, so I glanced at their
headlights as if to say, "excuse me; I'll just be a second," and took off down
the hill before them.  There is no tricky intersection at the bottom, and the
light god held the cars back for more than necessary, so I easily was off the
street and headed back up the hill before the cars even got to the bottom.</p>

<p>Up through what we call Coyote Park, I skated to the top of the hill and lay 
down beneath the bronze coyote which is pictured on the front of the Houston
A-L Yellow Pages phone directory (good till September 1997) and rested.</p>

<p>Skated twice down the hill at Jones Plaza, once with some traffic, and once
without, but it wasn't nearly as good as some of my previous adrenaline trips
down that hill (see 
<a href=/skate/skate20.html>Wild Skating Adventure Twenty</a>
for a brief description).</p>

<p>Skated around a bit, but I didn't really see any other skaters.
I went up to the University of Houston Downtown campus, to skate down one of 
my favorite hills in Houston.  At the top, I skated inside the campus building
for a while, got something to drink, talked to a few students.  I even found
a night club/bar kinda place where there were two guys doing a stand up comedy
routine.  Cool!</p>

<p>I tried flirting with the girl selling tickets to get in free, but she resisted
pretty well.  The manager came up and said I would have to take my skates off
to come inside anyway, so I left.</p>

<p>Back outside to the top of the hill, I waited for the light to turn
red at the bottom.  I counted 10 seconds (while some cars went by
before me) and then took off toward the bottom.  Push push push push
avoid the groove-of-death (<a href=/skate/skate10.html>Wild Skating
Adventure Ten</a>), light turns green, fly through the intersection
yahoooo what a rush!</p>

<p>Slowly skated around the block and back to UH Downtown and called Wende, my 
girlfriend, who I knew was working there in the bookstore.  I ate M&amp;Ms, read
<i>Beavis and Butt-Head do Hollywood</i>, and then we went home.</p>

                        <h1>1997 Dallas rally review by Rob</h1>

<p><p class=date>Monday 10 February 1997</p>
<font size=-1>transcribed out of my diary</font>
<p>
Dallas Rally was this past weekend.<br>
I brought Jon Whitten-Lege, Andrew L, Daniel Kamas, Cathy Saur, and Mike Noyse.
<p>
The first night after opening circle, I mostly just walked around and met and introduced a lot of youth.  I talked for a while in the sanctuary with Debe Barnes, Julie, Michelle, and Maia Cudhea about their youth group.<br>
I slept from 4am to 6am
<p>
I attended the AM workshop on Dreams and Consciousness. The dude focused a lot on physical scientific classical explanations, but we got to listen to Abby B&rsquo;s dream and analyze it.
<p>
I had a big peanut butter and strawberry jelly sandwich for lunch and attended the clay modeling workshop in the afternoon. I made Wende W an elephant salt shaker, which I hope she&rsquo;ll like. I haven&rsquo;t given it to her as it&rsquo;s not dry yet.
<p>
I helped Abby organize a game of Captain Video, where Mick (?) started us with a contortion of wrapping his hands around and over his head, which turned into a gyrating dance, pulling off a sweater ad tossing it at the viewer.  Cra Zee!
<p>
I organized a game of wink, which was painful but fun on the hard linoleum of Channing Hall. My left hip is pretty tender.
<p>
Ultimate frisbee was great fun in the YMCA field, just like 7 years ago except we had no earthball.
<p>
We played two games about 9 on 9 and then 5 on 6. A great time was had by all, I believe. I totally enjoyed being able to just run and run and run!
<p>
Muddy and tired, we drug our asses back inside where I chilled, listening to &ldquo;painful convictions&rdquo; nin CD with Tia Lawler.
<p>
Somewhere in all the Saturday activities, several of us slam danced to several obnoxious songs including &ldquo;Hey Man Nice Shot&rdquo; by Filter and &ldquo;Irresponsible Hate Anthem&rdquo; by Marilyn Manson. We threw 3 kooshes and a cloth frisbee around in Channing until it got too rowdy and Stacey H and Liz and Debe B organized a round of what we now call &ldquo;The Animal Game.&rdquo;
<p></p>

<p>In the game (in no particular order), I was kangaroo, Keith Lawler was
Giraffe, Grayson was Duck, Debe Barnes was Flamingo, Meagan Holt (?) was Chicken,
Liz was Baboon, Stacey Hendren was Dog, Suzanne Kelly was Scorpion, Kitty Rankin was
Cat, Aaron B was 3 Toed Sloth, Caroline B was Bunny, Erin B(?) was
Fish, Bryan W was Newt, and Tiffany Schneider was Pig.</p>

<p><p>
The two funniest patterns that occurred repeatedly:
<ol>
<li>Someone doing Pig, then Tiffany, in one desperate motion pressed her nose up and then made the comb of Chicken above her head.  Meagan would shriek &ldquo;stoppit!&rdquo; and make the comb and run and punch in place Kangaroo to me.</li>
<li>Keith would delightfully announce &ldquo;Giraffe! Giraffe!&rdquo; with his hand up high and wait for the person to nearly catch him before quickly grabbing his chin, &ldquo;Monkeeeeeey.&rdquo;<br>
One time I was It and the motions went to Keith so I ran over to Liz to wait for him to say Monkeeey and I tagged her an instant later.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Talent Show consisted mostly of jokes and me being the model for James Meine and Ben to put makeup on. Nutty.
<p>
At the end of worship, we sang &ldquo;Good Friends&rdquo; and spiral hugged around Abby B.
<p>
Stacey Hendren was Madame Dictator in Silent Football until 1am.  Then Zach Rutlege was dictator until he was practically falling asleep at 2am.
<p>
Slept, woke, cleaned, hugged, closing circle, donuts and more hugs.
<p>
Then Mike Noyse asked if I had seen Gabe Rendon and I sent Mike to the advisor room, and I went to the van where I found Gabe!<br>
&ldquo;Gabe!  Follow me!&rdquo; and I ran and he ran after me and we practically crashed into Mike as he was coming down the stairs.<br>
In slow motion, they tumble-fought, hugged, wrestled, punched crashing down the stairs at their last Dallas Rally.</p>

<p><p>I remember my last Dallas Rally hugs with Aaron Maxwell way back from 1990.  Aww yeah.</p>

<p><p>2:45am Monday 10 February 1997</p>

                        <h1>1997 Dallas rally review by Anna Magwood</h1>

<p>My First Rally Experience
<p>
My first rally was Dallas 1997.  <br>
I didn&rsquo;t know quite what to expect, but I had
heard from others that they were a lot of fun.  This was an
understatement.
<p>
We met at our church at about 6:15 and were on the road by 6:30.
Originally we were taking 6 to 8 people.  But in the end,
there was only me, Meagan Holt, Ben Hatfield, a friend of
mine from school Brandy Winans, and our
advisor Mark Holt.  We slept for most of the trip, except
Mark, and arrived at the
church around 10:30.  In the main hall there was loud music, a game of keep
away with a stuffed frog, and dancing.  This, paired with the fact that it
was freezing cold outside, woke us up pretty quickly.
<p> Opening circle included the reading of the rules and general introductions.
About half-way through opening circle Little Rock showed up and joined us.
<p>
 After that we separated into touch groups where we introduced ourselves, talked
about
what workshops there were, and what kind of underwear we had on.  I was sick
that night so I decided to go to sleep early, around 3:00 am.
<p>Saturday morning I felt much better.  Breakfast included:  a couple
different kinds of fruit, multiple cereal choices, and juice.  After
breakfast, the
workshops began.  I went to the symbols workshop and we talked about ancient
and modern symbols.  Then we had lunch which was make-it-yourself
sandwiches.  After lunch I went to the clay workshop where we were given a
big
hunk of clay and told to let our imagination run wild.  I began to work on
something abstract, but  in the end I had a plate, a cup, and something
coming
out of a pot.  Someone gave me a rose they had made.  It was beautiful.  I
was
going to keep it forever, but it got squished in my bag on the way home.
 <p>
 My touch group had dinner prep so I headed for the kitchen.  Dinner was
Mexican food.  My job was to shred lettuce.  Shredding done, I was just
standing
around in the kitchen with some other people when a youth walked up to me and
said that he did not know me, but just saying, &ldquo;Hi, my name is Dane Dormio&rdquo;,
made him uncomfortable because it was so &lsquo;normal.&rsquo;  So, he introduced himself
in
Spanish and I responded in French.  After we talked a bit he offered me a
stick of
Carefree gum, bubblegum flavor, which I happily accepted.  I had made a
friend.
<p>By the time everything was ready to eat, a monster line had formed.  But
before the masses could charge the kitchen, the advisors made them all sit
down
in one big circle and they had a dicussion, about rocks I think.  I was in
the kitchen
at the time with about 5 other youths because we didn&rsquo;t want to sit in the
group.
We soon got very hungry, so we just made a couple of tacos for ourselves and
had a jolly good time.
<p> When dinner was over I wandered into the movie room.  Everyone in there
wanted to watch some Mr. Bean.  This was when the feeling of belonging first
hit
me.  These people were my age and like me.  After a couple Mr. Bean episodes
we decided to switch to some Star Wars.  The Empire Strikes Back was put in
and I watched about 30 minutes of it before I started to get sleepy.  I
didn&rsquo;t want to
go to sleep just yet so I left and just wandered around the church until
someone
snagged me and hauled me to another building for the No Talent-Talent Show.
That was when I learned The Nun Joke, which I have since told to all my
friends.
Overall, the talent show was pretty good with Keith Lawlor winning with
&ldquo;Giraffe&rdquo;.
 <p>Immedately following the show was worship.  I felt so happy and secure
then.  I didn&rsquo;t quite know what I was feeling.  I only knew that I was in
shock.  A
sort of happy, excited, wonderful state of shock.  These teens were like me,
we
had the same kind of thoughts, ideas, and feelings.  All these years I had
been
thinking that I was alone with no one to really understand me.  My parents
understood me, but your parents aren&rsquo;t your peers.  Being accepted and loved
by
your peers is very different than being accepted and loved by your parents.
<p>The next morning we cleaned up the church and had breakfast.  Closing
circle had interesting readings about Zion.  Then we sang some songs I didn&rsquo;t
know and Bish-Bish which I had heard before.  It was great.  Bish-Bish always
gives me a rush.  Then suddenly everyone was saying good-bye.  Dane picked me
up from behind and gave me a hug.
<p>The ride home was quiet except for the ever present Beatles music, which
rocked.  I drifted between sleep and deep thoughts about what had happened
that
weekend.  I was so incredibly happy that I smiled nearly the whole way home
and
for days after that.  I have never done that before and it made me feel so
good that
I smiled even more.  The change that happened in me was not just something
inside my mind.  My friends noticed it too.  I am hardly ever shy anymore.  I
have
become more active in my classes and I voice my opinion much more.
<p>I love you all and I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ll do next year when I have to
graduate.  I hope I will be prepared for it because right now a month apart
seems
just too damn long to be away from your family.

<h1>SECOND ANNUAL HOUSTON RALLY 17-19 JANUARY 1997</h1></p>

<p><p>
Way back in like May 1996, I was called by Jason Fricke, and/or Nick Devereux
to see if I would act as adult host for the Houston Rally in January.  I was
extremely flattered and accepted immediately.</p>

<p><p>
Jason Fricke was the youth dean of the rally.  We called him The Dean on th&rsquo;
Scene.  I was the Host with the Most.
<p></p>

<p>We planned essentially nothing until we pulled together at the last moment the
Construct-O-Con (small planning rally) sometime back in October.  At that rally
we played all weekend except for a planning meeting that lasted about 2 hours
on Saturday afternoon.  I bring this up only to describe how we decided upon a
theme.</p>

<p><p>
It went something like this</p>

<p><p>
Jason: Let&rsquo;s call it Biff&rsquo;s Wonderful Clam Dip Rally!<br>
Rob:   How about YRUU Con?<br>
Jason: How about Biff&rsquo;s Wonderful Clam Dip?<br>
Rob:   How about YRUU Yukon Con?<br>
Jason: What about Biff&rsquo;s Wonderful Clam Dip!?<br>
Rob:   How about you come to the Yukon?<br>
Jason: Biff&rsquo;s Wonderful Clam Dip!!!<br>
Rob:   What the hell is Biff&rsquo;s Wonderful Clam Dip????<br>
Jason: I don&rsquo;t know.  It&rsquo;s just cool.<br>
Rob:   Well, how about something about the Yukon, because it sounds like YRUU
Con, and it&rsquo;s gonna be cold like the Yukon??<br>
Jason: Biff&rsquo;s Wonderful Clam Dip!!!<br></p>

<p><p>
The conversation deteriorated from there.</p>

<p><p>
We decided upon the title <em>YRUu Conning Me?</em>, and the T-Shirt design depicted
a seedy looking eskimo thrusting toward the viewer a small can of Biff&rsquo;s
Wonderful Clam Dip for $50.</p>

<p><p>
That, officially, is my version of how we chose such a random theme.
<p>
After the first meeting, most of the planning was done over the phone.<br />
Tuesday before the rally, I was talking to Jason, and we wanted to figure out a
cool cool cool Saturday Night Activity for the rally.  We had considered an author,
whose name I have forgotten  Peter McWilliams? who has written on lots of
controversial subjects to do something.  We considered getting a band,
or a street performer type person.
<p>
Then Jason said, &ldquo;ROB!!! I&rsquo;ve got it!!  We can do a Casino Night!!!&rdquo;<br>
My brain said, &ldquo;you kiddin&rsquo; me?  We&rsquo;ve got 3 days &lsquo;til the rally&hellip;&rdquo;<br>
then my other brain said, &ldquo;shut up, brain, we can do this.&rdquo;<br>
So I said, &ldquo;dude, Jason, that would <em>rule</em>!  How can we pull this off?&rdquo;
<p>
We brainstormed:
&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll need some fake cash, and some prizes, and some cards, and I don&rsquo;t
know what all else. &ldquo;
We jotted some ideas down and decided I would get the cash, and Jason would
get the prizes.  Jason somehow got a green felt Blackjack table cover and he
bought some cheap but functional bingo cards.  I bought a similar roulette wheel
and we were in business.
<p>
We mostly had everything ready to go by the Friday of the rally.
Jason and I met at SAM&rsquo;S CLUB Friday afternoon to purchase food.<br />
Wow.  Jason had his hair put up in two rows of spikes, so we got a
lot of attention, especially from some older ladies near the baked goods section.
I was wearing the rally shirt, with the seedy eskimo on the back.  I wondered what the yuppy-lookin&rsquo;
people in the store thought.<br />
<p>
We filled up one of their big carts, and then grabbed a flatbed cart thing and filled that up.
We topped off the flatbed with 40 loaves of bread.
Just over $500 in food.  Crazy.
<p>
That evening, about 94 youth, 11 advisors all descended upon First UU church in Houston, and I was in
charge of it all.  Wow.  It felt weird at first: running the advisor meetings, and answering
questions from every direction.  Taking charge is not something I&rsquo;m used to doing.
<p>
Unfortunately, the first problem happened really early in the evening, and just totally blew
me away.  Money had been stolen from like 3 different youths&rsquo; bags or purses or whatever.
It pissed me off; I felt helpless.  To have that happen at a rally is so entirely foreign;
I did not expect to have that problem whatsoever.
<p>
Opening circle was cool, though a bit long with all the YAC announcement stuff and what I
had to announce about my displeasure that some stuff had been stolen.
<p>
The first night went well, otherwise.  Rovers roved and I gave answers.  Strange to have
everyone looking to me for answers.  My decision.  Up to me.  It came easily in some cases.
Sometimes I delegated or asked for input, but a lot of times I just told them..  Just quick
problem solving.<br />
<p>
It kinda feels like advisor initiation to host a rally.<br />
<p>
I stayed awake till like 5:30 the first night.  I was roving around and was surprised to find
a touch group that just stuck together.  They started talking at about 2am after opening circle
and just kept on talking..  I joined their discussion about school, growing up, something else,
and something else until I was just too crazy tired.
Slept from about 5:30 to 7am.
<p>
The first workshop on Saturday was Government -vs- Personal Morality.  It gave a lot of stunning
questions to ponder- Do we pay for health care for the poor?  How much should they get?  Do we just
keep them alive, or out of pain?  Do we <br>enforce</br> health care for poor with infectious diseases?<br />
What about tuberculosis, with requires 6 weeks to cure, and if the treatment stops
before it&rsquo;s complete, the result is a stronger strain of the TB virus???????
<p>
Before that workshop completed its discussion session, the drumming workshop began downstairs.
I went down there after the morality workshop, grabbed a drum and joined in.<br />
<p>
The next workshop was mandatory: a presentation then question and answer session by 3 members of
H.A.T.C.H. (Houston Area Teen Coalition for Homosexuals)  We heard coming-out stories by each of
the 3 guys, and then were able to ask them questions.  It was emotional, informative, and great.
<p>
After that, we started to set up stuff for Casino Night, the Saturday night event.  During this
time, things got a bit crazy upstairs and Jason Fricke came running down.
<p>
&ldquo; ROB!!  Somebody just put a hole through the wall <em>This</em> <em>Big</em>!!&rdquo; he exclaimed, indicating
about 3 by 5 feet.<br>
I just started laffin.   This was too fuckin&rsquo; nuts to be true.<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;M NOT KIDDING ROB!!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I Know!&rdquo;   (AUGGHH!!)   &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go check it out.&rdquo;<br>
<p>
So, with much support from Linda Loden, youth on YAC, and a couple of advisors, I had to get the
rally under control, but I still wanted Casino night to go well.   (I wanted to just shout,
&ldquo;Everybody sit down and be quiet or go home!!!!!&rdquo;     )   After thinking through many different
scenarios, I decided to get all the youth up on 3rd floor and make them chill.
A few youth were chillin&rsquo; in the downstairs courtyard the entire time and I let them stay.
<p>
We herded everyone upstairs and had the advisors keep an eye on everyone while the YAC and I
interrogated those directly involved.<br />
The end decision was that the youth who actually hit the wall and the youth
directing the activity would pay for it monetarily, and apologize personally to Heather Lynn
Hanson (interim minister(?)) and the reverend Bob Schaibly.
<p>
Then we got <em>all</em> the youth into one room and talked to them.   I am highly indebted to
Laura Moriaty for firmly reminding everyone how we all signed a sheet saying we&rsquo;ll abide by
the Big 4 rules, including Respect of everything including the church.     She reminded
everyone how we are a community and how everyone looks bad when this happens.  &ldquo;How
can the YAC get anyone to believe we&rsquo;re responsible if this kind of stuff happens?&rdquo;
<p>
Once the verdict was announced, Mike Noyes was all,
&ldquo;why make them pay for it?  If we&rsquo;re a community, everyone should chip in.&rdquo;<br />
(What a difference that made in the rally.)
<p>
At the end of the discussion, I said something like I was upset, but dammit, we worked
hard to do Casino Night, and I want it to be fun!
<p>
Within about 15 minutes after everyone was released, about 140 bucks was collected
from the youth to help pay for the wall.  I described it later as &ldquo;everyone anted up.
&lsquo;I am in this community.&rsquo;&rdquo;  It really helped bring the group together.
<p>
Casino Night was great fun.  As people walked in the door, I handed out stacks of
$271 (?) worth of fake bills, with
the faces of the youth and myself who helped design the rally.  I was on the $1,
Nick Devereux on the $5,  Nick Carter on the 10, Patrick Zinn on the $20  Jason Fricke on the $50 and
Jennifer Warren, Amanda Hovland, and  Charlotte Benbenek-Price together on the $100.  Way cool.
<p>
Bingo, Blackjack, Poker, Roulette, and everyone who wanted gambled and had a great time.
Afterward, we auctioned off fabulous prizes.  toothbrushes went for between $400 and $600.
pez dispensers for $1000s.  Deodorant for $800.  A can of Spam for multiple 1000s.  A &ldquo;bag o&rsquo; candy&rdquo;
went for 1000s, which was pretty funny because it was old-ass chocolate so hard you couldn&rsquo;t
bite through it.  (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry sir- no returns&rdquo;)
<p>
For every item, Luke _________ kept yelling, &ldquo;Fifty Dollars!&rdquo; because that&rsquo;s all he had, even if
the price was in the 1000s.  He began to get creative with his bargaining, and it went something
like this:<br>
&ldquo;A night with Luke!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not worth 800 dollars!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;<b>Two</b> nights with Luke!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;<b>That&rsquo;s</b> not worth 800 dollars!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you head!&rdquo;<br>
Funny wacky stuff.
<p>
The biggest prize was the gumball machine, so we sold it last.
Jason held it up over his head.<br>
&ldquo;1 dollar!&rdquo; yelled Ben Atkinson.<br>
&ldquo;50 dollars!&rdquo; yelled Luke.<br>
&ldquo;300 dollars!&rdquo; yelled someone else.<br>
&ldquo;Five Thousand Dollars!!!&rdquo; yelled someone over the din.
<p>
The crowd cheered and the someone added their 300 dollars to the 5000 dollars and
the 50 dollars was chipped in to make the gumball machine sale go for $5350.  Great fun.
The funny funny funny funniest part was that the gumball machine required a penny to
let you have a piece of gum!!!
<p>
Then the No Talent Talent Show and Mike Noyes did a rap to drumming and Debe Barnes
and Bobby Hall pantomimed &ldquo;Bish Bish&rdquo; and we had no idea what in the world it was
until the walked back to their seats laffin&rsquo; &ldquo;That was Bish Bish!!!&rdquo;
At the end Nick Devereux did a 15 minute version of the Fuck You Clown joke.
<p>
Midnight worship happened at 2am and we basically just sat in a circle and
verbally tossed in good thoughts about the rally or whatever.<br />
<p>
After that, I played silent football with some of the best silent
football players from 2am till 5:30 am Saturday night after having been awake
since Friday morning (except for 1.5 hour nap)
This was the first game where Carina Dormio and I got to play together after
nearly a year of challenging each other.  - this dates back all the way to Dallas Rally
1996 where she made me get a penance point by jabbing me in the side during the game
and I told her she would <em>never</em> be able to get me another penance point again.
Nick Carter was Mr Dictator and I got <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> penance point for sticking my tongue out at
Carina (after she got <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> penance point for sticking her tongue out at me)
During the game, the funniest thing was when the elevator would <em>ding</em> and the door would open and
suddenly <em>blaring</em> random acoustic guitar and a wailing voice singing some random song would
jolt the quiet of the game.  It was amazingly funny, and difficult not to laugh and look to see
who the heck it was!!!
Also during the game, Kris Shallin sat in the circle, thereby tricking Carina, who counted him as
a player and went out of turn.  That was funny.  Someone accused Mr Dictator for seeing
Kris in the circle, and Nick retorted, &ldquo;I did not say I saw any non existing entity between Mr Rob
and Mr Jeff; I said that if Ms Carina had seen a non existing entity between Mr Rob and Mr Jeff
then Ms Carina would obviously have been mistaken.&rdquo;  Good job.<br>
Mr Dictator lost the game.  I had <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> penance point; Carina had 1.5.  Ha.
<p>
I slept for 1 hour after that until wakeup time at 6:30am.  I woke up the advisors and then
went out to find Jon Whitten-Lege rousing the youth by drumming like mad  on the various floors.
The coolest thing was when he would get a beat going [Boom] [Boom] [Boom] [Boom] [Boom] [Boom]
and then pause for a second and then doubletime [Boom|Boom|Boom|Boom|Boom|Boom|Boom|Boom|Boom]
<p>
I learned a lesson.  When I&rsquo;m the host of a rally, I need to get more than 2.5 hours of sleep.
I really appreciate Debe Barnes and Linda Loden helping me coordinate the waking of youth and
cleanup and getting them out.  We were highly late getting out and had a quick closing circle
&ldquo;Good Friends&rdquo; &ldquo;Yogi Bear&rdquo; &ldquo;Beaver Song&rdquo; and then had &lsquo;em grab a donut and head out the door.
<p>
Wende Whitlock saved my butt by being awake enough to do all the bookkeeping and stuff
after the rally.  I really appreciate her help.
<p>
That was it.  A great rally and maybe we can do it again (without the hole in the wall) next year.
<p>
With Love<br>
- Rob</p>

                        <p class=date>31 August 1996</p>

<p>This Labor Day weekend I am in Chicago visiting my friend Laura.
Yesterday I went skating.  She lives 1 block from Lake Shore Drive which curves
around her section of Lake Michigan.  I cruised over to the bike and skate
path they have along the beachfront.  It's mostly nice smooth asphalt, with a 
couple of steps down toward the shore, which is sand in some case, asphalt or 
concrete in others.</p>

<p>I sped along the path, navigating between walkers, joggers, skaters and bikers
as some bikers navigated past me.  If the path got too crowded, I would jump 
down the couple of steps to the much wider asphalt beach, and then back up to 
the sidewalk once I was past the crowds.</p>

<p>That was cool for a while, but I sought more adrenaline.</p>

<p>I used a pedestrian overpass to pass over Lake Shore Drive, and I ended
up in a park, from which I headed toward downtown.  I took care to note
which streets I was using, so I could find my way back.  I cruised the wrong
way down Dearbourne for a few blocks, looking for more traffic than it
provided. (I skate the "wrong way" so that I can see the oncoming traffic and 
take evasive action if necessary.  I don't like it when cars sneak up on me.)</p>

<p>I met Lynette who was skating in search of The Baby Gap.  I skated with 
her, asking where the coolest places to skate might be.  We ended up cruising 
down Michigan Avenue a couple of blocks.  ( I think it was Michigan Avenue - 
hey, it's a new city for me )  We parted ways, and I went down Grand Avenue 
(maybe) toward Navy Pier, where they have cool water fountains and a 200 foot
tall ferris wheel, a carousel, a big shopping mall and an IMAX movie thing.  
I skated around the big outdoor fountain, which had semi-predictable patterns 
of water squirting where kids kids and adults (not skaters who don't want to 
get their bearings wet) could play.</p>

<p>I skated up an 18 wheeler access ramp and back down.  It was only about 40 feet
tall so no big deal.</p>

<p>I skated back down to Michigan Avenue, so I could play in traffic.</p>

<p>I pushed my way between oncoming traffic and parked cars, sometimes onto the 
sidewalk weaving between people when the street got a bit crowded.  Sometimes 
turning hard when I missed a traffic light.  Every person for himself, 
compassionless, emotionless, honking, city traffic.  I love it.  
No one noticed a lone speeding skater, as long as he skated out of the way.</p>

<p>I found my way back to Lake Shore Drive, where I just rolled slowly watching
the people.  I saw a woman doing some cool "technical" footwork skating
backwards weaving her feet quickly between road reflectors spaced about
4 feet apart.  I was impressed with her ability.  Another woman sped past, 
manuevering through the crowds as I like to do.  So I took off after her.  
I figured she, if anyone, would know where to find the coolest places to skate.</p>

<p>I was tired, and she was probably in better shape than I, so I had to really 
work to keep up.  The lake front path magically converted into mid city 
sidewalk, as it angled down toward a busy city street.  "Cool"  I thought, as 
she aggressively cut through the bikes and people at the intersection.  I 
double checked her check for traffic and we both flashed across the street 
and onto the next curb.</p>

<p>Muscling up a hill, through much less pedestrian traffic,  I skated up beside 
her.  "You are the most aggressive skater I've seen all day."  She didn't 
comment, but answered by taking a sharp turn in front of me and away down a 
different path.    I took that as a hint to buzz off.</p>

<p>On the way back, I attacked the interesting intersection with similar vigor,
cutting around the back of a bicycle crossing my path, and converting much 
kinetic energy into heat and ruts in the grass as I made it off the street 
and stopped without crashing through several people and a dog.</p>

<p>I wound my way much more slowly after that, not to be more careful, but I was 
just dog tired.  I made it back and went skating again the next day.</p>

                        <p class=date>2 August 1996</p>

<p>Last night was my most recent Wild Skating Adventure.  I started at
Fuzzy's at about 9pm and skated down to Jones Plaza, where a Rod Stewart
impersonator was performing at Party on the Plaza.  For some reason,
there was not a very large crowd. ;)</p>

<p>I chatted with Joy and said HI to a couple of friends and tried to
find someone to play frisbee with me across the street at Jones Hall.
No one was interested, so I went to go play by myself, thank-you-very-much.
Turns out there was a security guard there, who was not allowed to
let anyone play in the area.  Doh!</p>

<p>So I talked with him a bit.  He's from Sudan and has a cool accent;
Sudan has about 200 languages spoken there but everyone speaks Arabic;
He's been in the US for a few months after being given political 
asylum in Egypt by the US.  He still wouldn't let me play frisbee.</p>

<p>So I went back to the Plaza and assured Joy that it didn't *matter* if
she had never played frisbee before; she could learn and be very
good at it.   We cruised over to a bank parking lot down the street
and played there.  She did quite well throwing for her first time.</p>

<p>As we played, a family walked by, including a 12-or-so year old girl.
I had just missed a catch and she smart alec-ly smiled, "it helps if
you catch it."</p>

<p>"Thank you so much," I replied.</p>

<p>After they walked by, she was still watching, so I threw it to her.
She yelled, "hey don't throw it to me *I* can't catch it!"  She missed,
but threw it back pretty well.</p>

<p>Skated back to the Plaza and hung out there a bit.  Some drunk guy
was telling me (I think) about how he was going to become a ninja and
one day everyone would want to be like him.  One day, he's going to
make a lot of money.  He didn't have a plan of action, though.</p>

<p>Joy and Linda and I skated toward La Carafe, where they planned to
get something to drink.  I got sidetracked at Market Square, where
some people were playing in the water sprinklers and shouted something
including the word "frisbee" so I threw it to them.</p>

<p>I was hot; the water was refreshing; I took my skates off and joined
them.</p>

<p>The grass felt super on my bare feet.  Freshly cut, it made a great
diversion from hot skates.  My clothes were entirely soaked after 
playing about 20 minutes.  Entirely refreshed and entirely wet,
I went inside to chat with Joy.  After about ten minutes of trying to
figure out how we can meet Ms/Mr "Right", I realized I was only wearing
one kneepad.  Doh!</p>

<p>I hoped not many people would be interested in a lonely kneepad
on the sidewalk.  When I went outside, I found a guy selling flowers and
watching for the owner of this mysterious kneepad.  He asked if I would
like to buy his whole bouquet of flowers for only four dollars.  I
truly did not have any money on me, but I was truly thankful for his
gaurdian services, so I went inside and snagged a dollar from Joy.
I bought 1 flower and talked with him for a while.</p>

<p>His name is David, and he's been homeless in Houston for about 6 months.
He had been laid off his welding job in Dallas, and came here for a
job that didn't work out.</p>

<p>While listening to his story, I could tell he took great pride in his
welding work, as well as pride in that he has not resorted to any illegal
activities to feed himself.  I also noted that he didn't necessarily
believe that anyone needed welding done.</p>

<p>I suggested simply that he talk to people, "say- who do you know that
works where people weld?"  Or maybe go to a truck stop and just start
talking to the truckers, who certainly come into vaguely close contact
with the welding profession.  (Certainly closer than I do, as a 
programmer.)</p>

<p>Joy came outside and I gave her the flower in exchange for her answer
to "who do you know that needs to hire a welder?"  Her dad works over
in the ship yards.  Certainly he would know someone.  She didn't have
his work number handy, but the point was made clear: he may find
work more easily if he poses that question to people.</p>

<p>David cruised over to Pete's Blues Burgers to see what he could buy
for a dollar and to see who knew of some welding jobs.  Joy and Linda
cruised home, and I cruised back over to Jones Plaza.</p>

<p>The younger crowd of aggressive skaters were there, grinding on the
steps, so I stopped to watch.  Randy saw my frisbee so I threw it to
him and we tossed it around a bit.  The drunk would-be-ninja guy
was there and he played pretty well for his condition.  Maybe he
will be a ninja.  I did a few cool catches, considering I had to
navigate the curb, parked cars, and a few moving vehicles on the
street.  At least *I* thought they were cool.</p>
