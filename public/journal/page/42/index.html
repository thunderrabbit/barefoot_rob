<p>Been working too much recently, but not enough to trigger carpal
tunnel issues again, fortunately.</p>

<p>Today for AB I nearly finished a report that AB wants to have
available.  I thought I could finish in 2 hours, but it has taken 6.5
so far.  fack.  I will tell them it has taken longer.</p>

<p>Today for JB I did my normal Wednesday schedule (Solid Square with
Ayano and them, then two kid lessons and two adult lessons in JB
office from 15:30 - 21:00).  Had a gap in the middle so went to Muza
for their ワンコイン 500 yen lunchtime concert.  Had a nice snooze
during the performance, a string quartet, which played for about 40
minutes.</p>

<p>１０年前<a href="https://mt2.robnugen.com/">二番目のビーだせん</a>は六ヶ月で作りました。　Ten years ago, I made <a href="https://mt2.robnugen.com/">Marble Track 2</a> in 6 months.</p>

<p>いじめる人が「六ヶ月は無駄でした」だって。　Trolls said I wasted 6 months.</p>

<p>ファンの人が「すごい！どうやって作った？」だって。  Fans asked how I made it.</p>

<p>だから、去年新しいビー玉線路「三番目ビーだせん」を作り始めました。  Therefore, last year I started a new marble track, Marble Track 3.</p>

<p>予定は毎週二時間以上「三番目ビーだせん」を作ります。 The plan is to work on it at least 2 hours per week.</p>

<p>今も作ろうと思ったんだけど日本語の宿題も大切です。I was going to work on it now, but I should also write Japanese.</p>

<p>一年かかったんけど５〜１０パセントしか終わっていないと思います。 It has taken a year, and is 5 to 10% complete, I think.</p>

<p>I started a channel on YouTube for my latest passion project: Marble Track 3, which is being built to show people exactly how to make a marble track out of wooden sticks and glue.</p>

<p>It all started 10+ years ago when I showed Marble Track 2 to the world. <a href="https://mt2.robnugen.com/">https://mt2.robnugen.com/</a>  As you can see in the comments, trolls were like &ldquo;you wasted 6 months of your life!&rdquo;  Fans were like, &ldquo;wow!  how did you make that??&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, to answer them both, I have embarked on a multi-year project, Marble Track 3 Construction.  You can see the snippets I have so far via <a href="https://mt3s.robnugen.com/">https://mt3s.robnugen.com/</a>   I have spent a bit over a year so far, and guess it is about 5 to 10% done.</p>

<p>Eventually I will make a website for it (looking for a designer now), and add music, background video, etc.  For now, step by step, frame by frame, the longest stop action animation I have ever attempted.</p>

<p>In addition to creating frames for the movie itself, I have been
creating a curved track to be the stand-in track for the large marble
to spiral around the whole stage.</p>

<p>I worked for JB at three different locations around Kawasaki Station
today, as I do every Wednesday, at Solid Square, SSC, and JB main
office.  Solid Square lesson went pretty well; we drew mind maps of
our favorite places and then said a few sentences about them.  Then I
had a break during which I Marco Poloed with Richard from ae911truth a
bit and then worked on AB, nearly finishing this ticket since it
received a bit higher priority at our last meeting.</p>

<p>SSC featured lunch with Tomoko and then she reminded me of M&rsquo;s
birthday yesterday and bought a present &ldquo;from me&rdquo; which I wrapped.
Then lesson with Tomoko and head out to JB (via bus cause it&rsquo;s kinda
raining) and I spent some time working on AB and nearly nearly got the
ticket finished.</p>

<p>Four JB lessons each Wednesday: two lessons with kids and then two
with adults.  New student in the kids lessons is pretty genki, and may
have a good effect on the others.  We had them write some letters N+1
times and then practiced language &ldquo;I have a _____&rdquo; using different
plastic fruit.  We had tried &ldquo;I have a _____&rdquo; and &ldquo;I want a _____&rdquo; but
they kept getting &ldquo;have&rdquo; and &ldquo;want&rdquo; mixed up, so I switched it to only
&ldquo;have&rdquo; because I remember not being able to distinguish the words for
library and post office for a long time because I had learned them on
the same day.</p>

<p>In second class I used the same fruit to lay out a fake city, hoping
they would enjoy giving directions with fruit as landmarks.  It did
not work as well as I hoped; they prefered playing various sports with
the plastic fruits (which I can understand, but was frustrating for a
bit).  They finally got into it a little bit, but then <em>really</em> got
interested with Kazu brought in his computer with an animated game
version of giving directions.</p>

<p>In the third class, we used past perfect(?) e.g. &ldquo;I have worked in _____
for ____&rdquo; and &ldquo;I have lived in _____&rdquo; because the language pattern
came up in their banter at the beginning of classes.</p>

<p>In the fourth class, they were not saying much, and I was getting
tired, so I invited them to tell me their favorite fairy tale in
Japanese.  They told me the story of Peach Boy.  Their version seemed
to be missing a lot of possible sub-plots; I wonder how it was
originally written.</p>

<p>I have been writing this on the train from Yako to Tsudayama, and am
feeling super tired.</p>

<p>If I had my way, I would be magically transported home from here.
Thank god for Lin who usually picks me up from our station on
Wednesdays.</p>

<p>I did not keep careful track, but I believe we had 15 men in Tokyo
men&rsquo;s circle (Integration group) last night.  According to <em>A Circle
of Men</em> we should think about splitting the group if the group is
larger than about 12 men.</p>

<p>I wonder about splitting the circle into two groups on the same
evenings, or possible begin a circle on another evening of the week.</p>

<li>I just got home from
<a href="https://www.meetup.com/Apocrypha/events/249933126/">Apocrypha #15</a></li>
</ol>

<li>Was up too late last night and did not do much good for myself (porn), but
I on the productive side I read some of MJG&rsquo;s new book
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rots-War-Ignifer-Cycle-Book-ebook/dp/B07BCDRQDF">The Rot&rsquo;s War</a>
Ignifer Cycle Book 2</li>
<li>co-gender circle seems to have come back to meeting after a
significant dip in attendance over winter holidays</li>
<li>men&rsquo;s circle has had pretty solid attendance, often with 7 men.  I
might start tracking the <em>numbers</em> of attendees to see if there are
any useful patterns</li>
</ol>

<li>today I got a good start on the outer spiral for the large and
medium marbles for Marble Track 3</li>

<li>Still have my MacBook Pro, like 4 or 5 years old now</li>
<li>Lin and I have lived in our house for 2 years yay</li>
<li>Jennie is good and has a cat door so she can come in and go out on
her own schedule</li>
<li>I have been talking to Kristen via Marco Polo recently</li>
<li>I have not been talking to Richard via Marco Polo recently.</li>
<li>Just met T from AB to figure out the next priorities for the
site.  Good meeting, and good to meet with them regularly.</li>
<li>I applied to &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; a symphony orchestra for some event at Muza
on July 1st.  Will find out around 15 June if I got it.</li>
<li>Still have not made any more LINE stickers beyond the first two I
made for Jennie, including &ldquo;Jennie says what&rdquo; which is no longer
for sale (Lin did not like one of the pictures) and &ldquo;Jennie says
yeah&rdquo;</li>
<li>Maybe I will make &ldquo;Jennie says Tomoko&rdquo; and have the name Tomoko
written in various ways around Jennie posed in various ways.</li>
<li>Monday noon lessons at U in Nishi-Azabu are getting better; I seem
to have found a good groove with the students.</li>
<li>dev on ConSwi for Godot has stalled in past couple of weeks. ugh.</li>
<li>Co-gender group meets on Mondays and men&rsquo;s circle meets on
Tuesdays (since early 2018)</li>
<li>I have been studying on Thursday nights with Mel in Chicago for a while.</li>
<li>I have been teaching on Sunday nights with Sarumama near Shinjuku
for a much longer while.</li>
<li>Last week I had a meeting with Michael in UK to talk about ways to create a
program for corporate team building.</li>
<li>Been going to SOGO each Sunday, and Lin&rsquo;s friend Aki has started
to come as well.  She has attended twice in past two weeks and
seems keen to continue.</li>
<li>She asked Junyu how to get more physically fit; he talked for 15
or so minutes in Japanese and I understood 80 or 90 percent.</li>
<li>I could probably say 5% or 10%</li>
<li>I have been using my waterproof Aquos phone for a while..  maybe 2
years</li>
<li>M$ is going to buy Github, which is good for the Github peeps I
guess, but likely bad for open source.  I will move my junk off to
something else.  Maybe.  Fred recently installed Gitlab on one of
his servers.  Maybe I can use it.</li>
<li>Each Monday I have been chilling in Saizeria between Nishi-Azabu
lesson and co-gender circle.  Time to head to co-gender circle soon.</li>
