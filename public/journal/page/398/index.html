<p>I just Fibby McFibfibbed to Discover, trying to get a 0% balance
transfer thing with them.  Told them I owned my residence (that's
a euphamism for "I have free room and board") and that I'm self
employed (euphamism for "currently unemployed"), and that I make
around $38,000 per year (euphamism for "I have a job lined up that
will pay 3,000,000 yen per year").</p>

<p>Catch me if you can; I'll be in Japan!</p>

<p>Kate Robinson is here at the Bibby's house; she's been here plenty
of times before.  Not like a million times, but like a hundred times.
Maybe ten.  Anyway, she's never answered the phone here before
tonight.</p>

<p>Char, a friend of mine who I invited to my 12000th day party
tomorrow, called to say she cannot attend.</p>

<p>Kate knows Char through church.  So, for the first time that Char
has ever called here, and the first time that Kate has ever answered
the phone here, it was the same time.  Kate was all, "it's Char!" in a
surprised whisper.  How amazing is the universe.</p>

<p>I basically got through my list of things to do today.  It's a list
that's been chillin' on my computer for quite a while.  I'm really
glad to have gotten it all done.  The weird thing is that I don't feel
really accomplished though because it didn't seem like I did all that
much.  Except for the fact that I've been on my computer almost all
day.</p>

<p>Except for chatting with Kate and Jack just before noon on the
futon in Sean's room for a while, and eating, and throwing banana
peels into the back yard, hoping they'd get stuck on the wire, talking
to Sally (West) (not Sally on the west side), and listening to Ben
Fold Five and Ben Folds Live with Jack and Kate.  And hugging Matt
when he came to pick up Kate.  They should be in Austin soon.</p>

<p>Anyway, I got my address book entries moved to my website, using
the shareware <a href="https://www.tesol.net/scripts/AddrBook/">address
book here</a>.  It's not fantastic, but it's really good for a freely
downloadable thing.  I'll probably pay her a few dollars for it.  I
put the addressbook on my website so that I can lose my computer and
not lose the addresses.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p><img src="/images/front/wtf_on.gif" align="left">And the very last
thing I worked on today was to be my new FAQ, but in my case I'm
calling it a WTF.  However, I had originally intended to just make it
hardcoded, considering the answers won't change very often.  However,
however, I just realized that if I'm to move my site forward to the
uber plan I have for it, where every page has consistent navigation at
the top, the way journal.pl does now, I can't hardcode the pages.</p>

<p>That means that I've got to write some script that will just
display my WTF pages, which might be a bit complicated considering I'd
like them to 'branch out' in various ways.  I gotta sketch them out
before I can figure out wtf I'm talking about though.  Sigh.</p>

<p>Aight.  Bedtime.  In 25 minutes I'll be 12,000 days old.  Actually
I turned 12,000 days old 35 minutes ago cause I was born in EST.  Give
or take an hour for daylight savings.  Too tired to care.</p>

<p>Tomorrow will be a funtastic time; I'm really looking forward to my
party.  I'm so so thankful to Maggie for dealing with all the details,
the RSVP list, the catering, the securing a room, getting a book for
everyone to sign...  I've decided that I will maintain this book in a
way similar to how I did my handwritten journals, allowing people to
sign them at various events, like a quasi scrapbook/memorybook thing.
Anyway, I'll keep this book and bring it to my 12,500 day party on
Monday 14 June 2004 and 13,000 day party on Thursday 27 October 2005,
etc.  Fun Fun fun stuff!!</p>

<p>Oh, and thanks to Mark Leonard who found a cooler <a
href="https://www.timeanddate.com/date/duration.html">days old
calculation</a> site than what I've written.</p>

<p>Ran errands with Janette, including getting wire mesh to cover a
hole in the attic where a squirrel has been visiting, using insulation
to make a nest.</p>

<p>We were careful to not disturb the nest, which included little pink
hairless *<em>cute</em>* squirrels.. like 4 of them about 3 inches
long each.  They made little not quite squeaking, not quite groaning
noises when we were messing around with our new screen to cover their
screen.  The nest was between the outer slats of a vent and the screen
behind it.  Apparently the mom squirrel had chewed through the screen
and collected insulation, then packed it back down between the screen
and slats for a nest.  The nest was apparently complete, considering
it had little squirrels in it, so I trust that she won't need any more
insulation from inside the attic.</p>

<p>So we blocked the hole and I hope the babies will be okay.  They
are sooo cute!</p>

<p>We also cleaned out a bunch of shit from the attic to throw away
and some to give to Good Will.  Wonderfully productive day.</p>

<p>After errands, Janette and I have been listening and reading aloud
respectively <em>Stranger in a Strange Land</em>.  40 pages worth this
evening.  She has been preparing spinach quiche and chocolate chip
cookies and ranch dressing and salad.  Yummmm eeeee.</p>

<p>She's got to leave at 5am for Boise Idaho for a few days.  She and
Charity are installing decoration for another restaurant.</p>

<p>Joel had to write an autobiographical story for a class.</p>

<p>He asked Jack to write it.  Jack didn't know what to write so Joel
was all, "it doesn't matter, just write anything as long as it's
autobiographical."</p>

<p>So Jack wrote the story of the first time he kissed a boy.  It's
quite well written.</p>

<pre>
The summer before I started high school I was lucky enough to get to
leave home for the first signifigant period of time. I was going to a
"smart kid" camp in North Carolina. I spent the first month of the
summer bursting with apprehension and excitement to meet new people
and to study subjects I never would have had the chance to explore in
my high school.

The group of boys I had attached myself to at the begining of camp
played ultimate frisbee every afternoon. I usually played too, but on
the fourth day of classes I decided to sit out with a spritely boy
named Jon who couldn't play because of his broken wrist. He always
watched the game from a stone bench just outside of the north
endzone. Jon was shorter than me, fair-skinned and quite skinny. When
we first met I found his preppy dress and private day school manner
irritating, but his urbane and sarcastic wit appealed to me much more
than the sophmoric simple-mindedness of my other companions. At
fourteen Jon was the first openly gay teen boy I had ever met. I was
at once intrigued by and wary of this strange new creature, like a
child who had discovered a hedgehog in the backyard. Almost as
interesting to me as his alien sexuality was jon's outspoken
intelligence. We had philosophy together and I was frequently
impressed with his grasp of the material and insightful, often
hilarious, comments.  Almost everything about him was outside the
realm of my previous experience, but I decided to try to change that.  

We were sitting on the bench facing each other and continuing the
discussion about Zeno's proofs from class that day, when I noticed
that I had been holding my breath for quite some time. I tried to take
a deep breath and could not; there was a thick anticipatory tension
tightening my entire body. I started to tell Jon that I needed to take
a walk when he leaned in and kissed me. It was short, soft, and
open-mouthed. I felt as though someone had replaced my guts with
sun-warmed honey. My physical reaction was obvious and immediate. At
first my mind did not question the rightness of what had just
happened. But then I was blasted by a wave of shame and
fear. Disgusted, I flung myself off the bench, landed on my face in
the dirt, jumped up and took off at a dead sprint.


Jon found me twenty minutes later, huddled and shaking in an empty
classroom, face streaked with dust and tears. He calmed me down enough
to try to kiss me again. This time I allowed the wonderful fever to
overwhelm me. Jon and I would be difficult to seperate for the rest of
camp.

I learned a lot that summer about myself and the world outside of my
hometown. But that particular incident and the subsequent
self-discovery has had the most lasting impact.
</pre>

<p>Joel had no idea what story was being composed.</p>

<p>Jack had no idea the assignment includes reading the story aloud in
front of the class.</p>

<p>I asked, "is Joel gay?"</p>

<p>"He is now!"</p>

<p>How can I feel so far behind on stuff *and* feel like I don't
really have to do anything *and* be on vacation all at once?</p>

<p>By not planning my day, filling it with good stuff that I think is
important, and just getting bogged in replying to countless emails,
each of which I treasure, but don't seem to have the energy or
enthusiasm to reply to 'em all.</p>

<p>Okay, I'm going to make a list and see what happens from there.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Argh.  My brain is imploding in a downward spiral.  Watch this:</p>

<p>Gotta work on my things to do list</p>

<p>Open up my existing list</p>

<p>Resist doing things on the list</p>

<p>Gotta prioritize things and maybe add things to the list</p>

<p>Oh jeez this isn't working, look up, see dishes; I oughta do the dishes.</p>

<p>Man fuck that I just want to go to sleep.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>okay.  Okay.  Okay.  I can do this.  Cointoss: heads = stay awake/
tails = sleep: heads.</p>

<p>cointoss: heads = inside; tails = outside:  heads.</p>

<p>cointoss: heads = on computer; tails = not on computer:  heads.</p>

<p>cointoss: heads = write; tails = read.  tails</p>

<p>cointoss: heads = stuff directed at me; tails = stuff directed at
the world = tails.</p>

<p>cointoss: heads = LJ; tails = google: heads.</p>

<p>cointoss: heads = comments to old entries; tails = new entries
online. heads</p>

<p>cointoss: heads = am I on the right track?  tails = no.  tails.</p>

<p>Dammit.</p>

<p>I've emptied, refilled, started the dishwasher.  Read but not
replied to emails.  I'm going to look for a hub so Janette can have
multiple computers online at once when people (me) have laptops
here.</p>

<p class=date>11:47am</p>

<p>Found what I need at Radio Shack, but forgot my wallet.  Back at
home now; just got my wallet.  Okay, go.</p>

<p>Yahoo!  It works.  I'm impressed that it does work.  Janette's
computer is configured the same way it has been - to use PPPoE to
connect to her DSL provider with username and password.  My computer
is now connecting using DHCP, whereas it used to have to use the
username and password.  I don't know how the hub is so smart to let
one computer's username and password....... hmm I have an idea.  Maybe
the DSL provider just gets a username and password from anywhere and
then lets the rest of the data traffic flow, no matter where it wants
to go.  Sounds good to me.</p>

<p class=date>2:43pm</p>

<p>The kittens (Joel, Kate, Jack) rolled out to meet Josephine for
lunch.  She called about 1/2 an hour ago and hadn't seen them.  They
apparently got lost.  I got directions from her and will pick her up
at 3:45.</p>

<p>I've cleaned out Scott, got most of the shit thrown away or
recycled or integrated with the house here.</p>

<p>Been listening to Eminem pretty loudly on Janette's stereo.</p>

<p>Went to IHOP with Joel, Kate, Josephine tonight.  Mostly Joel and I
said "Alright" like Mitch Hedberg.</p>

<p>The waitress gave me Josephine's whipped cream from her hot
chocolate.  She was not willing to make a face different than a happy
face for Joel's Smiley Face pancake.  But she did give him the less
expensive adult Smiley Face pancake instead of children's version.</p>

<p>We switched tables while Kate was in the restroom, but she didn't
notice.</p>

<p>Tina called Kate's cellphone and I answered it, claiming it was my
cellphone, then gave it to Joel, who talked a bit, then gave it to
Josephine who did not get to talk because Tina had hung up.  Then Tina
wouldn't answer her phone when Kate tried to call her back.  I hope
Tina is okay.</p>

<p>I climbed into the back hatch of the van, over all the seats to the
driver's seat to drive home.</p>

<p>Just got back from taking Janette and Charity to the airport.
Bumped <em>Eminem Show</em> on the way back.</p>

<p>I'm going to work today, but I haven't read LJs in a long time.  I
also should eat before I go.</p>
