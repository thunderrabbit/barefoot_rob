<p><p>work work work work.  Is this all I do?</p>

<p><p>Yesterday KTRU was fun.  I got only two calls - a request and a &ldquo;what song did you play at about 7:15am?&rdquo;  That last one is kinda difficult to answer; I wasn&rsquo;t the DJ at that timeslot, but DJs do maintain a log of all the songs we play.  I gave the caller a list of some artists - probably one is what she&rsquo;s looking for.</p>

<p><p>That reminds me&hellip; sometimes I&rsquo;ll get calls, &ldquo;hey - what group is this?&rdquo; and I&rsquo;ll say a name like &ldquo;The Kaumsers&rdquo; and the caller goes &ldquo;okay&rdquo; and hangs up.</p>

<p><p>How are they going to find that?  Kaumsers could be spelled any variety of ways.  I always want to ask, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you want to know how to spell that?  don&rsquo;t you want to know the record label?  don&rsquo;t you want to know the publication date?&rdquo;  But they&rsquo;ve already hung up.</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>Oh my gosh.</p>

<p><p>Wende just called and said a person from Southwestern Bell called.  We should have a dial tone by tomorrow night!!!!</p>

<p><p>I have written some entries at home and I will send them as soon as possible.  3 entries I think..</p>

<p><p>Yay!</p>

<p><p>To make things easier for you, my lovely readers, I will prefix the
names of these entries with PP, so when they all finally get moved to
my site, you can simply search for PP and find the ones you&rsquo;ve not
read yet.</p>

<p><p>Wende called her mom (who works for Southwestern Bell) to see if
she could help us get our phone connected more quickly.  No answer
yet.</p>

<p><p>After work, I grabbed some burritos from Mission Burritos and Wende
and I munched.</p>

<p><p>After munching, I read about a future satellite called MAP, which is
supposedly going to map the universe to answer some amazing questions:
<br>Is the universe going to expand forever?
<br>What shape is the universe?
<br>and others I don&rsquo;t remember</p>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s not very late, but I&rsquo;m going to bed; Wende&rsquo;s schedule puts her
at work at 7:00am, so I&rsquo;m shifting my schedule as well.</p>

<p><p>Our phone at the house is not working yet.  I just called Southwestern Bell and spoke with Amy who transferred me to &ldquo;Sylvia in Construction&rdquo; who said that they need to lay more phone cable before we can get service.  Estimated completion is May 5th.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So what I&rsquo;m hearing is that we won&rsquo;t have a phone until May 5th.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It may be sooner or later than that, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I asked Sylvia to transfer me to billing so I could discuss transfer fees.</p>

<p><p>Ginger in billing answered and I described the situation about construction.  I said I want to remove any transfer or connect fees.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not able to do that; let me transfer you to them.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Will you transfer me to the right person who can remove it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I was on hold for a moment and then Ginger picked back up.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sir, I show that the transfer fee is zero.  Someone already did it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What about a connect fee?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I mean; it&rsquo;s zero.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You are awesome; thank you very much.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>May 5th is several days away.  I&rsquo;ve been assured that I won&rsquo;t be billed for this period of no phone.  But can I charge them?  Will they give me credit if I gripe enough?  Is it worth the negative energy to get some dollars?</p>

                        <p><p>The grand irony is this: I am typing this at home, where I have no
phone until around May 5th.  Could be sooner; could be later&hellip; so I
really don&rsquo;t know when these will be moved to my site.</p>

<p><p>If I write several entries from home and from work during this time
period, I expect there will be a significant overlap in stories.  I&rsquo;ll
put some effort into remembering what I&rsquo;ve already written.</p>

<p><p>I set up my computer today!  Cleared the clutter of boxes and
shelves from the study, set up my new Elfa desk with 2 computers on
it.  My linux (Red Hat 5.1) machine is what I&rsquo;m on now.  The other
machine will be a Windows 95, but currently it has no hard drive.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ve enjoyed having a stereo!  We just bought it on Friday and I&rsquo;ve
had it on pretty much the whole time I&rsquo;ve been home.  Mostly DJ Jazzy
Jeff and The Fresh Prince: <em>He&rsquo;s the DJ&hellip; I&rsquo;m the Rapper</em> and
<em>Homebase</em>.  While listening this morning, I enjoyed reading
from <em>Vibe History of Hip Hop</em> the chapter &ldquo;The Real Old School&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Today and yesterday at work were busy with SAS programming.  I&rsquo;m
definitely getting better at it, but I&rsquo;ve kinda reached a plateau
(maybe) until I attend a SAS training class in May (I think).  We&rsquo;ve
got a big ongoing data collection project with users entering data and
entering names of people to rate them.  Even with all our precautions
to help them find existing names in the database, we still get name
variants of the same people.</p>

<p><p>The most wacked is when they enter the last name where it says
&ldquo;Enter First Name&rdquo; and the first name where it says &ldquo;Enter Last
Name&rdquo;..  C&rsquo;mon people, read!!</p>

<p><p>About a couple of years ago, Houston waste management gave every
home a big plastic trashcan that requires one guy in one truck to pick
up trash where it used to take three guys in one truck.  I called them
to see how to get our trash can for the new house.  She asked for my
name, phone number and address.  &ldquo;It will take a week to get it to
you.&rdquo;  A week?  Can we just come pick it up?  &ldquo;No sir, we&rsquo;ll bring it
to you.&rdquo;  Thanks.</p>

<p><p>I haven&rsquo;t sent The Feel Good Net in 8 days.  It&rsquo;s all on this
Internet-less computer.  Hmmm.</p>

<p><p>Pretty much moved all my stuff yesterday.  Super special thanks to Molly, Maggie, John, Will, Dude, Jason, kT, and Nicole who all participated in the move.</p>

<p><p>There are a couple of items that we didn&rsquo;t move:  my 23 year old couch (handed down from my dad) and 11 year old particle board computer desk ($40 from Wal Mart.  We got our money&rsquo;s worth).  These items we left out by the street.  Someone can have them, or big trash truck will pick them up.</p>

<p><p>My ex landlord called on Saturday.  &ldquo;Rob, this is Mark, your landlord.  I hope everything went well with the move blah blah.  Don&rsquo;t forget, the couch is still your responsibility; you can&rsquo;t leave it on the curb like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Fortunately, Wende got the message and not me.</p>

<p><p>She relayed it to me later and I was all, &ldquo;what???????????&rdquo; and began a tirade for several minutes.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This is why I wasn&rsquo;t going to even tell you,&rdquo; she replied.</p>

<p><p>Molly suggested, &ldquo;make him prove you put it there.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>The grass on which the couch is located is between the sidewalk and the street.  Therefore, the city owns it.  It&rsquo;s on this strip that big trash is placed so that the city can clean it up.</p>

<p><p>That is all I have to say about that.</p>

<p class=date>6:43am CDT Saturday 15 April 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Last night was my last night at my apartment.  It stands out from
other nights because my cat was a maniac!  Meow meow meow meow meow
meow meow at 4:00 o&rsquo;clock in the morning.  I think he just wanted to
go outside.  Poor mr Spot is being converted to an inside cat now.</p>

<p><p>I tried to tell that cat to chill by petting him, but most of my
energy was not inside my body; I kinda just flopped my arm on top of
Spot.  He wriggled out and had a 4:am meal at his food dish.</p>

<p><p>So this is it.  Moving day.  Maggie, Molly, John, Will, Dude,
Jason, Wende, Stacey (sp), and I will all be here at different parts
of the day to help me and Wende both move; mostly starting in 2 hours.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m going to pack my computer now, unless I can think of a good
excuse not to.</p>

<p class=date>5:35pm CDT Friday 14 April 2000</p></p>

<p class=date>8:00am</p>
<br>I arrived at new house with two goals in mind:
<br>1) Wait for telephone guys to hook up our phone
<br>2) Write snail mail to my mom and pen pals

<p>Also during that time Paul the sheetrock and painter dude fixed
some minor imperfections in the wall and a big ol' scratch in the
windowsill of the upstairs study.  (Is it window-sill or windowsill or
window sill or what???)

<p>Telephone guys arrived around 11am.  I enjoyed watching them hook
up the phone line from scratch.  No demarc on the house, they pulled
cable from the telephone pole next door, ran it through a conduit
underground to our house, bolted on a demarc (interface between
telephone company and customer), connected the wires.

<p>They weren't done by the time I left for the closing at noon.

<p>- - - - the closing - - - -

<p class=date>noon</p>
<br>Suite 1011 of this big bank building.  Lovely corner view looking
out toward Galleria and Rice Village.  Huge long wooden table with
snacks on it.  I guess they can afford snacks when we're payin'
several dollars to kick off the loan.

<p>Del was the guy's name; I don't even know what he really does.  Is
he a lawyer, a banker, loan officer?  Pile of papers to sign.  

<p>"This says that you blah blah blah blah blah.  Initial here and
sign here at the bottom.

<p>"This says that if you default, the bank gets the house.  Sign here.

<p>"This says blah blah blah that you understand blah blah.  Sign here
and here.  Be sure to sign it exactly as your name is printed.

<p>"This says that you will pay property taxes.  Sign here.

<p>"These are all the different variants of your name.  Rob Nugen,
Robert Nugen Jr.  Robert Nugen, Rob Nugen Jr.  Please sign each line
as each line is printed.  This says that all of these different names
are yours."

<p>By this time I was like, "they can bite my butt."  And I signed
them all the same.

<p>So much stuff to sign.  Initial each page.  Sign each document.

<p>"How on earth can anyone read all of this?" I asked.

<p>He said most people don't.

<p>I asked my higher self if I should be reading stuff.  I got only
good feelings back - <em>this is the right thing to do.</em>

<p>By the end, I didn't know if I wanted to laugh with joy or scream
with fear or cry like a baby.  All of these emotions were mixed up in
my head.

<p>One cool awesome thing though: Del had a bookshelf with a huge
variety of books on it.  Novels, gardening, travel, cats, spiritual,
financial... tons of stuff.  He offered each of us a book - me, Wende,
Diane, and Don (the home builder).  Diane spent a lot of time looking
through them. She found me a book on cats, but I was all, "nah... I
don't really want a book on cats."

<p>(Wende joked, "Rob doesn't really like cats; he likes his cat.  If
you can find a book on Spot, Rob would love it!")

<p>I went to the bookshelf and <em>bing</em> the perfect book: The
Vibe History of Hip Hop.  "Hole E Shit!" I thought.  That is so
awesome!

<p>Diane and Don were duly surpised at my interest.

<p>- - - - Container Store - - - -

<p class=date>1pm:</p>
<br>We got copies of all the documents, keys and garage door openers to
our house!!!  Wende and I trekked to Container Store.

<p>Nice hutch for kitchen, nice shelves for stereo.  Trash cans, soap
dishes, toothbrush holder.  $1001.63

<p>"Just spend it all in one day and get it over with!"

<p>- - - - Phone Part II - - - -

<p class=date>3:30pm</p>

<p><br>Back to the house, there is no dial tone.  Hauled the goodies
upstairs, called telephone company on Wende&rsquo;s cell phone.  Her phone
was getting bad reception so I came back to my apartment to call.</p>

<p><p>No dial tone at my apartment either.  Hmmmm.</p>

<p><p>Hooked my phone up to my computer phone line, called telephone
company.  Basically they agreed the service should not be off at my
apartment, and yes, they are not done at new house.  I did get them to
waive the $38.35 transfer fee. Nice.</p>

<p><p>Now I&rsquo;m going back to the house to see what&rsquo;s up with the
refrigerator and dryer; they should be coming in today.</p>

<p><p>Also coming over is Wende&rsquo;s sister Stacey (sp).</p>

<p><p>As I finish this, it&rsquo;s 6:03pm.</p>

<p><p>One grand irony of journaling:  when I&rsquo;m busy, there&rsquo;s lots to write about, but no time to write.  When I&rsquo;m boring, there&rsquo;s plenty of time to write, but nothing worth writing.</p>

<p><p>(That reminds me of a funny thing:  Back back in the day, when I was 8 and my brother was 4, he would whine when he was bored, &ldquo;mom, I&rsquo;m boring.&rdquo;  We would say, &ldquo;yes you are&rdquo; or &ldquo;no, you&rsquo;re pretty entertaining!&rdquo;)</p>

<p><p>Okaay&hellip;  focus!</p>

<p><p>Last night after a non-nightmare day at work, Carrie called me!  She and I met in a Shakespearean Literature class one summer at UH.  I studied; she didn&rsquo;t.  She got an A; I didn&rsquo;t.  Anyway, she lives in Dallas, but here on business.  We got yummy Amy&rsquo;s Ice Cream (and brought some to Wende at her work) and talk talk talked.</p>

<p><p>That reminds me, Wende is now full time at her work!!  (Molly, act surprised when she tells you ;-)  She is the Store Administrator, which means she counts the cash and does scheduling and stuff.</p>

<p><p>Carrie and I actually brought the ice cream to Wende at work just as Wende was leaving.  So we finished ice cream, then went to Taco Bell to munch tostadas.  Talked house stuff, work stuff, new job stuff, old stories stuff.  Super big hugs to Carrie and we parted ways after tostadas were demolished.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>Today Kevin is back at work.  We have some database stuff to work on, but are currently waiting for answers from our client.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>My apartment is almost completely packed.  Karen (my dad&rsquo;s girlfriend) came over last night and picked up a desk, 2 sets of shelves, and a TV stand that dad and I built in 1976 or so.</p>

<p><p>Tomorrow we close on our house!!  WOW!!  I&rsquo;ll work in the morning and then be at closing at noon.</p>

<p><p>The name of this entry is pronounced &ldquo;T minus 13&rdquo; as in 13 hours
until closing!!  Not that I&rsquo;m excited or anything&hellip;</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m kinda feeling down on myself for not being &lsquo;productive&rsquo; these
past couple of weeks.. I haven&rsquo;t planned out my days, creating a
Things To Do Today list.  Just been Sleep, Go to work, Pack, Sleep, Go
to work, Pack.. over and over.  I guess this whole moving ordeal is a
pretty big deal, worthy of messing up my schedule&hellip; .</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ll be glad to be back in the flow.</p>

<p><p>All my stuff is packed up, almost keeping me from feeling like I&rsquo;m
in my house..  It&rsquo;s almost like I have nothing to do here because when
I try to do something I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;oh wait - that&rsquo;s been packed.&rdquo;</p>

                        <p class=date>4:50pm Tuesday 11 April 2000</p>

<p><p>Today I had to wear pants.  That started this crappy day.  Pants and
shoes.  And socks.  As I left, I thought about writing this entry.. &ldquo;oh
what a tough day; I had to wear pants&rdquo;&hellip;</p>

<p><p>The day got worse from there.</p>

<p><p>I wore pants to look &lsquo;nice&rsquo; for a free VPN seminar thing I attended at a
local hotel.  VPN = Virtual Private Networking.  I didn&rsquo;t really learn
anything at this event.  Did get some free bagels and sliced fruit and
orange juice for breakfast.  That was nice.</p>

<p><p>A barrage of emails attacked me at work.  Or rather they had already
attacked and were waiting calmly to pounce on my when I logged in.</p>

<p><p>The short version is that a small pile of our users were not able to log
into our website.  The reason was because of some of my lovely SAS code.
 I&rsquo;m not the SAS expert; but I&rsquo;m learning.  In this case the lesson is well
imprinted on my brain.   I don&rsquo;t feel totally bad for this error.</p>

<p><p>However, the problem was compounded because I forgot to restart the
dispatchers yesterday  (and would have today), so the monster sized log
file of errors kept growing like The Blob.  My boss, being out of town, was
overcome by the 27Meg Blob when he checked his email.  In one email he
wrote:</p>

<pre>
Also, are you restarting the dispatchers as Drew discussed with you?
I'm dreading getting the next error log if it is cumulative.
</pre>

<p><p>Oh no.  That&rsquo;s when I remembered to restart the dispatchers.  I felt
terrible about forgetting.  Speaking of dread, I certainly didn&rsquo;t want to
talk to him.</p>

<p><p>Second email from him:</p>

<pre>
I'm dead in the water trying to view these logs given the size.
</pre>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>But my boss is great; I love this job.  Without anger, he said simply,
&ldquo;we need to address this and make sure you won&rsquo;t forget next time&rdquo; (or
something like that).</p>

<p><p>He was able to walk me through solving the problem, including a patch to
my code that caused the error, and cleaning up the results of the error.
 The Blob has been defeated.</p>
