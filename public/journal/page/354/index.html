<p>Work at KQ was pretty fine today.  I had all man to man lessons
except for one (2 guys).  And I did my first level check.  He was 65
years old, and about level 7C.   A high level 7C; I recommended that
he be given high level lessons and auto-level up in 5 classes if all
five instructors thought he passed the lessons.</p>

<p>I'm developing a crush on Sumika, who works in KQ full time now.
She speaks English pretty darn well and though some people have
suggested she's rude, she seems quite polite and nice to me.</p>

<p>Wende has said this is my one romantic-tragic-flaw: I won't stop
looking.</p>

<p>I gave my email address to a woman today and felt no remorse nor
regret.  In this case it's not that I hope to bang her, but she seemed
like a cool cat and we might be able to do a language exchange.  We'll
see.</p>

<p>The quote of the day:</p>

<pre>
You've been here 85 days and you know hiragana?

You're so clever.

<p>My flatmate Frank is writing a book about his experiences in Japan.
When I first contacted him in early March, he sent me a bunch of
emails.  I didn't read them until after I arrived in Japan cause I
didn't want them to taint my view of Japanese culture.  I wanted to
experience Japan with a Beginner's Mind (a term from Brugh Joy, I
think).</p>

<p>I just finished the five or six such emails I hadn't previously
read, and I'm inspired to write a bit more about <em>Japan</em> and
not just my experiences in Japan, though of course, these are all
based on my experiences in Japan.</p>

<p>Let me first be clear that these are about Tokyo, the huge
city-capital of Japan.  Things way out in the country may be far
different.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A ridiculous number of people here smoke.  Cigarette vending
machines are in every building, every train station, and many street
corners all around the city.  Officially minors are not allowed to buy
cigs, but obviously there's no controlling a cigarette vending machine
outside on a street corner.</p></li>

<li><p>A ridiculous number of people here drink.  Drinking seems to be
a hobby for some of my students.  Not that they come in drunk (though
a couple do, and I do mean couple like two students out of hundreds,
not a couple per day), but some of them say "I like drinking" when we
do the smalltalk chit chat at the beginning of some lessons.  Many
have said (essentially) "I am tired cause I was up too late last night
drinking."</p></li>

<li><p>Many of the Nova instructors drink.  Frank warned me that many
of them have drinking problems, and I may have to agree.  I can easily
say 2/3rds of our teachers drink every night, and some I know get
plastered at least once a week.  I know one instructor at our school
has called in sick more than once for this reason.</p>

<p>Upon a brief discussion with Frank, we decided that this job
attracts, rather than creates, people with drinking problems.</p></li>

<li><p>Japan has excellent customer service.  When I approach the
counter of a convenience store or restaurant, I never have to wait for
a clerk.  That's not to say I never wait in line, but never is there a
customer at the counter without a clerk there.  Many times another
clerk will appear if more than 2 people are in line at a single
register.  If possible, that clerk will open another register.  If
that can't be done, then the clerk will help with sacking the items,
heating food, etc.</p></li>

<li><p>Japan has excellent customer service.  I can be lost in a train
station, and ask any uniformed person how to get to X.  That person
will do everything possible to make sure I understand how to get
there.  This may include drawing maps, giving me maps, finding someone
who can speak better English, or actually leading me where I'm trying
to go.</p>

<p>My best story in that department starts when I was lost in the
wrong train station.  I talked to a custodial woman who led me on the
train, <em>rode with me</em> to the next station, and would have led
me to the platform of the next station had I not begged her pardon and
assured her I now recognized my surroundings.</p></li>

<li><p>Japan has a great variety of toilets, including the
porcelain/stainless-steel-lines hole in the ground, water-mising
western style toilets (turn the handle one way for number 1, another
way for number 2) (like that which is in our apartment), and heated
seats with butt sprayer and bidet like that which is available in
hotels and some nicer office buildings.</p></li>

<li><p>Japanese are in love with their cell phones.  Part of the
reason may be that the phones here utterly destroy the best phones
available in the US (I don't know about Europe).  My tiny flip phone
can take pictures, browse the web (including submitting form data,
though the interface is a bit cumbersome), send email (including
sending pictures as attachments), has 500 person memory (and can have
a picture associated with each person, so when they call their number
and picture appear on my phone), has tons of rings available, allows
me to compose my own ring tones, has two full color displays (inside
and out), and can make and receive calls.</p></li>

<li><p>Japan is quite sexist.  Women are often expected to be
housewives.  Comic books often depict rape scenes.  The age of consent
for girls is 16, and for guys it's 18.</p></li>

</ol>

<p class=date>11:51pm</p>

<p>I'm tired.  More later.</p>

<p>Back in the day (April 1987), I started my diary in an actual
book.  I've decided to transcribe all those old books, so I brought
the first book to Japan.  I haven't transcribed any of it, although I
may have transcribed some while on the plane here.</p>

<p>Anyway, it's been chillin' in the bottom drawer of my plastic chest
of drawers and I noticed last night that a fine layer of mold? had
grown on it.  EEEEK!!!  Not acceptable.  Fortunately, it wiped off
easily, with no apparent damage to the book itself.</p>

<p>I just sent it to janette, so she can read it and protect it
from the dreaded Japanese Plastic Drawer Mold.</p>

<p>On the way out of the post office, I saw a little fuzzy caterpillar
(omushi) on the ground.  I carefully stepped over it, and watched as a
mom and her mom(?) and a little one in a stroller went in.</p>

<p>The omushi got mooshed, stepped on by one of the women.  I wondered
if it would recover, a little bruised, but still kickin' it (as much
as caterpillars can kick).  He didn't seem to recover, a little wet
spot on the ground, and the omushi probably left little moosh spots in
the post office.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>shudder</em></p>

<p>It makes me wonder how blithely unaware I am while walking through
the world.</p>

<p>Great night with Ç”Ç› - first teaching her, and she gave me a
chocolate something that I've not opened yet, so I don't know exactly
what it is.  She set herself a goal of learning the language in
Chapter 2 of the book we're using.  Next week we will have a
conversation with that language.  "How many CDs do you have?  What
type of music do you like?  Do you like pop music?" and the like.
(not just about music, but structures like those)</p>

<p>Then zipped over to a Mexican food restaurant and yammered with
Andrew et. al. - Stewart, Andrea, Toron (sp), Ben, James, and one more
cat whose name I don't remember.  Ç”Ç› basically followed the
conversations, and participated as well as she was able.  That rocks.
And gives me inspiration that I could do the same thing in
ì˙ñ{åÍ.</p>

<p>After dinner all the others went off to get drunk.  Ç”Ç› and I did
not.</p>

<p>On the way back to èaíJ station, I asked her what was the
meaning of some counter on a billboard, and then I realized it didn't
say "6478", but "647ì˙" with the last character being the kanji meaning
day.  The billboard is an advertisement for the Tokyo Expo, which will
begin 647 days from yesterday.  In scanning the rest of the billboard,
I noted "2003êÊ 03åé 25ì˙"  It starts on my birthday in 2005!</p>

<p>Ç”Ç› explained most of the kanji on the thing, and I told her I had
just read about the technology to be used on the tickets: each ticket
will have a unique RFID tag (Radio Frequency IDentifier (I think!)),
which is basically the new generation of barcodes.  The difference:
barcodes must be scanned by visible light (laser), but an RFID can be
scanned via radio waves.</p>

<p>I don't know how the tickets will be handled at the Expo, but this
type of technology could bring to reality instant checkout at the
grocery store.  No individual scanning needed.  Just roll the cart
through a portal and bang it's all scanned.  (possible exception of
food that is sold by weight).  I'm sure there are one or two or a
million-jillion more possibilities for the technology.</p>

<p>I read about it <a
href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/030523/36/e0npu.html">here</a>.  For
the record, I predicted individual bills would eventually be
scanned/monitored.</p>

<p>Hands down most happy/unexpected thing today: Matty took my
passport to Lloyd's so I didn't have to fax a copy to them.  I'm
thankful that I remembered my need when he said he was going!</p>

<p>Doubly thankful that I was able to tell <em>him</em> to bring his
passport so he wouldn't have the same experience as I had
yesterday.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Couple days ago Aki cancelled our meeting on Thursday (tomorrow)
(radio).  On my way out the door today, she called and cancelled today
(fever).</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I fucked around on my computer, trying to get it to execute cgi
scripts as a local web server, but couldn't get it to work.  Due to
directory permissions, at first I couldn't even serve text files, but
now I just can't serve results of executables.  My goal is to get days
in Japan counter on my site, and I wanna test it locally so I won't be
spending a lot of dollars at the cafe to do it.</p>

<p>Took a big ol' phat nap (haha fell asleep on my bed with my
computer on my chest; the screen hit my forehead as I drifted off..)
<em><b>whack</b>, hey jack, wake up!</em></p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Frank came home.  Apartment will be much louder than while Matty
and I were kickin' it alone.</p>

<p>I'm in Kikuna to meet Shin now.</p>

<br>Hi, Rob.<br>
<br>
It&rsquo;s Mika, do you remember?? I&rsquo;m a student at Kawasaki school, and took your lesson(Lucky man to man lesson at 5:50) last Thursday. I&rsquo;ve just checked through your web, it was &hellip; &ldquo;Wow!!&rdquo; I started to keep my diary from start of this year, but I couldn&rsquo;t keep it&hellip;I haven&rsquo;t been doing it for about a month, now it&rsquo;s impossible to remember for last one month. <br>
<br>
I checked around April where you started to work at my school, it was funny!! I agree with you, English Steve is really NOVA teacher, I think. I&rsquo;m not sure about him outside of school, but in a class, &hellip; I cannot explain well, but he is a TEACHER!! so, maybe some teachers don&rsquo;t like him. I&rsquo;ve hard that a teacher asked office to transfer to different school because of him, is that ture?? Anyways, I&rsquo;ve laughted when I read that you said as him &ldquo;motherfucker&rdquo; (~O~) I could learn so natural and useful(!?) English!! You can be a great teacher and it will come soon that the day you have to write your authography(I might make a mistake the word, it means write about yourself and make a book) and can sell it!! But you&rsquo;ve already gotten ready to make it, don&rsquo;t have to worry about it! <br>
Hu&ndash;h-&hellip;<br>
<br>
Hope you can understand my poor English.<br>
See you soon!!<br>
 <br>
Mika

                        <p class=date>2:18pm JST Tuesday 17 June 2003</p>

<p>So far:</p>

<p>Attended class with Olivia and Kimberly.  Kimberly's baby Lanny won
again with the wail that retrieves the mama.</p>

<p>I found it distracting, not cause I empathized with her, but 'cause
it was annoying.  I'm thankful that I'm not a father.</p>

<p>Came home, read some technology and world news.  Seems Microsoft is
trying to handicap linux by disabling the best linux antivirus
software. Lockheed Martin (?) has been given cash (only $6M I think)
to develop a nuclear propelled craft to explore Jupiter</p>

<p>Chatted with Masahiko at the bank and withdrew cash.  I seem to be
turning a profit in Japan.  I've got about 225000 yen in the bank.  He
remembered me and (just barely remembered) qmy name.  I remembered his
name cause I had written it down last time I yammered with him (and
specifically looked it up before I visited the bank this time).</p>

<p>On a train now to sign up with Lloyd's so I can transfer money
home.</p>

<p class=date>2:47pm</p>

<p>Sweet.  My train navigation skills are kicking ass compared to when
I first got here.</p>

<p class=date>3:51pm</p>

<p>Cancel that.</p>

<p>I got lost as fuck on the subways.  Well..  yeah pretty much lost
as fuck.</p>

<p>Got here though.   Only a million years later.</p>

<p>My train navigation skills on my own line are kicking ass compared
to when I first got here.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>In other news, upon arrival at Lloyd's, I noticed that I did not
bring my passport.  Fuck fuck fuck.  But at least I was able to speak
with an native English speaker Nick (from Britain, it seems), who
confirmed that I had properly filled out the form.  I will fax to him
the copy of my passport.</p>

<p>(I will have the staff at Nova Kawasaki fax it to him)</p>

<p>Now I'm off to Shibuya.   May it be ten million times easier to get
there than it was to get here.</p>

<p class=date>5:14pm</p>

<p>It was easier.  I'm at Starbucks in Shibuya, and have started to
fall asleep in at this tall chair and table.  Not too comfortable.
Place is pretty busy; I hate to use up a table this way, but oh well.
I'm sure Starbucks can afford it.</p>

                        <p class=date>4:23am JST Monday 16 June 2003</p>

<p class=dream>During Thanksgiving Holiday, Mark Holt was cooking a
tremendous meal,but he added some kind of rubber to the nodles, like
he cooked in some fishing lure rubber to see what would happen.  The
result was less than optimal; he had to cook some new noodles because
the rubber melted and mage a huge mess of the original noodles.</p>

<p class=dream>My dad drove Fred and I to New York to meet up one of
Fred's friends that dad and I had never met, but we had heard of from
Fred's stories.  Like the story of the cat who could only come into
the three adjacent laundry rooms, but not the rest of the house.  Or
the son who was a talented video game player and aspiring musician,
but not willing to go to school for either.</p>

<p class=dream>I met the mom first, and shook her hand.  She was
showing me</p>

<p class=dream>Oh I met the son first and shook his hand, and then he
left and the mom was showing me which three rooms the cat was allowed
to vsit, and I was like, "I've heard of this cat!" to kinda bless her
family with a little bit of fame or notoriety, and her story got
sidetracked because the three rooms were actually rather large and
somewhat confusing for me to understand which three rooms were
allowed; and by room did she mean this entire house that was the size
of a room in the other house?</p>

<p class=dream>We ended up outside by the clothes lines and a cat was
sitting on top of the clothes line and I climbed up on the picnic
table to say HI to the cat and the cat actually smiled at me which
seemed rather surprising since cats seem pretty reserved, but this cat
smiled and then I was petting it and it bit the crap out of my thumb
and drew a bit of blood.  I was glad to realzed it was only a dream,
but my thumb still hurt.</p>

<p class=dream>I sang an impromptu song with the woman, about how I
slept all the way to New York, and it only took five hours, but seemed
even shorter than that cause my dad drove the whole way.  She was
pretty impressed with my song.  It went rather crude at the end
something about my dad was tired so he's going to bed and while he's
asleep give me head or something and I'm like whoah I didn't think I
should sing such lyrics in front of someone I just met but oh
well.</p>

<p>I'm in the cafe now, about to fuck around with my site a bit, first
to encapsulate the days old calculation code and then to call it via
some perl command that I can use with .shtml files or .pl files.  This
is a risky venture since I haven't done any flowcharting or rough
drafting; I could just be wasting a bunch of time, which is rather
foolish considering I'm paying by the hour, but it's what I wanna do
right about now.</p>

<p class=date>7:18am</p>

<p>All that stuff about working on my website....  cancel that.  I had
downloaded a security update, rebooted my computer, and it wouldn't
come back up.  Just beeped four times, and the sleep light was on,
then flashed off five times consecutively, which is almost certainly a
code that I can look up somewhere.</p>

<p>I'm guessing it means my computer was too hot, for the heat
dissapation fan had gone into high gear.  I've felt the machine hotter
before, but maybe just not during a reboot cycle.</p>

<p>Anyway, it seems all fine now, but now I'm no longer at the
internet cafe.  And I'm choosing not to go back and pay another 380
yen to start an hour of ..  it's 300 yen for each subsequent hour so
I'll only lose 80 yen by going back.  but I'm kinda not in the mood
anymore.  I'll read through the emails I downloaded and see how I
feel.</p>

<p>I can tell even before I start that I'll just feel lethargic and
sleepy.  I imagine that society is going through a phase of attachment
to our computers/internet connection, and that in 20 years there will
be support classes for IAA Internet Addicts Anonymous - those that
just want to be online cause it feels good.</p>

<p>Just had "Crazy Midori" in a lesson with another woman (Rieko) who
seemed to have a far superior grasp of English.  Midori just went on
her own tangents or forgot who was the customer in the role plays, "oh
oh custamah" pointing to herself.  And then point to Rieko,
"custamah?"  who by that point was obviously stifling laughter.  Oh it
was just ridiculous.</p>

<p>Midori laughed at the idea of reserving tickets to a movie theater
(once we explained that cinema = theater), "I don't know America, but
no reservation movie theater Japan."  And Rieko is just making faces,
trying not to laugh, but then she just busted out when Midori jumped
back to "I customah?  reservation restaurant?"</p>

<p>I worked to communicate with both of them on their own levels,
favoring Rieko because I imagined my efforts with her would more
positively affect the world than helping Midori work out who was the
customer.</p>

<p>I am so thankful for Rieko's good natured reaction to the whole
thing, and I really hope she learned something.  I wrote for her the
language that she seemed to have not previously heard, and she scooped
that up at the end of the lesson.  More precisely, Midori scooped up
all the pages I had written, and Rieko gingerly requested those couple
of sheets I had catered to her.</p>

<p>Kaori, who's one of our regular students, didn't attend the lesson.
I wonder if she saw Midori there and said "false" .... Cause Kaori is
in the voice room now, so it's not like she went home.</p>
