<p>Arrggh!</p>

<p>I reported to everyone that I could get into the building with a simple
piece of cardboard, which is the technique I resorted to after I could not
get a new electronic card after mine broke and our landlord refused to
replace it because it still functioned, but wouldn't attach to my keys.
That's the part that broke.</p>

<p>So I cut a hole in the card in an attempt to make it work on my keys, and
I destroyed its functionality in the process.</p>

<p>The POINT is, that I am PISSED that I have to but a fucking new card
because they wouldn't fucking replace the one that broke, not through
neglect but through normal fucking usage and *AND* I didn't have to fucking
tell them I could get into the building.</p.

<p>I don't think it's appropriate for anyone but our landlord to get me a
new fucking card.</p>

<p class=date>10:27am</p>

<p>I talked with Karla who helped me understand this "problem" from
different perspectives.  Helped me realize that I'm just hurting myself with
my anger.</p>

<p>I will pay the thirty fucking dollars for the card and I will devise a
technique so amazing, so flawless that I will never lose the card, never
allow it to be scratched or marred in any way.  I will frame it elegantly as
art when I leave the company, and when I'm old and give away all my
possessions, I'll give away the frame and keep the card in my treasured
scrapbook.</p>

<p>My dad came over tonight, just to talk and hang
out.  This was our night to hang out as a make-up for
the night he didn't hang out very long though I left
KTRU outdoor show to hang out with them.</p>

<p>This night we talked about work stuff and
relationship stuff and the counseling Wende and I are
doing.</p>

<p>Then I was all, "we can play Pente," and he goes,
"I'll whup your butt."'  And I thought <em>eeep</em>
as I ran upstairs to get the game.</p>

<p>Turns out he hadn't played in 15 years, and I
whupped his butt 4 out of 5 games. and I helped him in
3 of the games, and he won one.</p>

<p>After the fifth game, he was all, "have you been
whupped enough yet?"</p>

<p>Yeah..  I'm thinking so.  not!</p>

<p>Big hugs and I walked him out to his car.</p>

<p>Now Wende and I are going to go out to eat!</p>

Querida Roberto,

Robnugen.com reports that Scott broke down! Did you
get him fixed? What was wrong?
</pre>

<p>Oops!</p>

<p>That's one thing about journals; stories written in
realtime may not be mentioned after their
resolution!</p>

<p>Scott is fixed.  He had a sore distributor cap and
rotor thing.  That was replaced.  While we were at it,
he got a new valve cover gasket, which should keep him
from leaking in the garage.  (We do still have
cardboard on the floor though in case another leak
appears.)</p>

<p>All for the low low price of $700 or so. 
(including $100 to determine what was the problem with
stalling in the first place.)</p>

<p class=note>(Mother's Day)</p>

<p>Before church, it was pointed out by Rodd and Stacy
that Karston hadn't pooped in a while.  'He's probably
going to  do it at the most inopportune moment,'
predicted Stacy.</p>

<p>At the end of the service, which was quite
passionate with members' proclamation of Jesus as
their Savior (including a band and choir on stage),
Wende was holding Karston who pooped yellow/green
runny all in his pants and down Wende's leg and onto
her foot and shoes and the floor.</p>

<p>Note - Karston is still only getting milk and
formula, so 'poop' is only in the orificial
distinction, and has no indication of its
consistency.</p>

<p>Stacy exclaimed (so quietly that only those sitting
next to her heard) "Shit!" and  "oh no I cursed in
church!"  Wende found that exclamation beyond
hilarious.  I was first clued in when I saw Wende
laughing <em>so hard</em> (silent, with tears), and I
thought, 'what could have been that funny???'</p>

<p>Oh guroosssS!!!</p>

<p>We're at the parking lot for lunch now.</p>

<p class=date>11:44 am</p>

<p>How wonderful of a setting with all wooden porch
and little white christmas lights lining and dangling
in various places.  The river is about 150 feet below,
nestled through the trees, mostly hiding the city
streets in the not-too-far distance.</p>

<p>Buffet style lunch, but I'm in a weird quandry. 
I'm choosing not to eat a lot; I could eat two more
plates worth, but I'm comfortable with the amount of
food in my tum now.  What if I'm crazy hungry
later?</p>

<p>People keep asking 'aren't you hungry?'</p>

<p>Well, no actually; I'm perfectly comfortable, I'm
just not eating as much as everyone else.</p>

<p>Part of me is concerned that I'll get hungry before
everyone else.  Oh well, I guess.  I imagine that the
optimal solution would be to just carry food with me..
but how to carry a good variety of nutrients and
stuff?  I'm not sure.</p>

<p>Driving with Wende's parents now out to our wedding
area. town?  city?  it's small.  Going through our
invitation list now, and I suddenly got a little bit
of anxiety when I thought about reciting <em>the
vows</em>.</p>

<p>This is odd.  As I'm going through my list of
friends, I'm feeling a bit of guilt at inviting so
many.   Wow.  not that I'm inviting a million, but I'm
still like hmmmm.</p>

<p class=date>10:00 am - 11:06 am</p>

<p>We just visited the lodge where the wedding will
be, scoping out the place and getting counts of
numbers of rooms and beds and stuff.  The place is
reserved by someone else for Thursday night; we were
hopeful that we could get it for the rehearsal dinner.
 Last year we reserved our space for Friday and
Saturday nights</p>

<p>We may have people park across the street about a
mile down.</p>

<p class=date>11:47 am 12-5-01</p>

<p>Just looked at one more place that will host 40
people.</p>

<p class=date>12:09 pm </p>

<p>Just looked at another place, which is across the
highway from the river.  Funny story about that - they
built a foot bridge that does everything but cross the
highway.  They couldn't get the permit to do so. 
Doh!</p>

<p class=date>4:25 pm 12-5-01</p>

<p>Back at Mike and Cindy's  house; I'm actually in
the guest cabin.  So very tired.  While the parents
were shopping in H.E.B., Wende and I slept in the
truck in a relatively not comfortable manner, but
comforting enough to sleeeeep.</p>

<p>It's raining pretty effectively now.  I love this
rainy season.  When the air is on the edge of hot and
the rain pours warmly over everything.  I just love
it!</p>

<p>Sleepy time now.</p>

<p class=date>6:46 pm</p>

<p>Great nap.</p>

<p>I read part of Time Magazine's book <em>The Century
in Pictures</em> or something like that.  I think I'd
enjoy reading a lot more of that book.   I realize
it's history written by the winners, and only about
our country, but it's a lot more than I know now.</p>

<p>Stacy, Rodderick, their new baby Karston came over
with Julie (who lives here)  from their house (where
Julie stayed last night because she played basketball
nearby).  We got to see the cute cute birthday
card/book thing that Rodderick made for Stacy - lots
of handprints and footprints of Karston's and little
writings mixed in.  All laminated and nice.</p>

<p>Julie opened some cards and gifts for her birthday,
and Wende and I got some gifts from their cruise by
Mexico.  Cool ceramic mask thing, and a vial of sand
(not stolen, but purchased as a souvenier)..</p>

<p>We watched the latter portion of Miss Congeniality 
on DVD, and then watched it with Sandra Bullock and
the writer commenting on the movie as it played.  I
really enjoyed  that perspective, and even got the
impression that I could write a movie and make several
dollars helping film it and stuff.  There's a million
things behind the scenes that I don't know yet.  I'll
just have to write the script first.</p>

<p>Maybe I'll do that tonight.</p>

<p>Didn't get to watch the entire moie in that way;
got all the way to the final setting where Sandra's 
character was about to determine that the crown was
the weapon, when Wende notified me that her parents
were staying away from bed because we were their
guests and we were still up.  Silly thing, that. 
Especially when we were inited to make ourselves at
home; I guess I could invite them to make themselves
at home and go to bed when they need to.  Some customs
I just don't understand.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>

<p>This is  stupid.  Wende is all pissy because I
fucking covered her boxer shorts when I carefully
pulled back the breadspread in a carefully folded pile
at the bottom of the bed.  I was going to be all
yoiink and just rip the shit off the bed, but I
realize that her control freakin' mom would have a
heart attack if the bed wasn't made and Wende will
have a heart attack if we don't leave the place
perfectly perfeclty perfectllly fucking perfect, so i 
fucking folded the bedspread down and folded her
boxers up in it, So Wende was all, 'ehn' and got her
boxers had to reach a whole fucking 1 foot up under
the bedspread to find them and then was all, 'fill my
basket'  quoting her work bullshit sales pitch thing
and I'm  like fuck you fukcer fuck you ..  but I just
said 'bite my butt' and I sat in anger for a second
figuring out why I was mad and I realized that it was
because I tried to fill her fucking basket by fucking
pulling the bedspread back all nice and shit and she's
all wah wah wah bullshit that I covered her fucking
boxers???  fuck this.  who needs it?</p>

<p>So I've been typing furiouslly on my little keyboad
as she reads her book.  Now I'll talk.  I know there
are a lot of mistypies, but oh fucking well.</p>

<p class=date>8:23 am next morning</p>

<p>Last night I expressed the source of my anger to
Wende (not being acknowledged for what I did do
thoughtfully) and she acknowledged and all was good. 
I am so thankful that we can communicate so well.</p>

<p>Now we're getting ready for church.  It's a bit

sandals) and a shirt with a collar.</p>

<p>Wende and I have been talking a lot about me and
Dave at my work, and how much I let hiim irritate me,
and some possible ways to begin to heal this
craziness..  I have a lot of anger and
pissed-off-ed-ness at him and cite all the dumb things
he does.  Lots of stuff that's just nothing like
me.</p>

<p>Wende suggests that maybe I'm afraid of being like
him, and maybe there is a part of me that used to be
like him.  But the overwhelming feeling she gets  is
that I just need to love him and try to connect in the
best way possible.</p>

<p>Hmmm(pf)</p>

<p>I can certainly at least see the value in just
telling Kevin and Karla that I've got some personal
issues against Dave, and maybe just getting it out
there will help me deal with it.  Maybe.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Right now I'm at Loves truck stop before we take
higway 90 to her parents' house in New Braunfels.  We 
were surprised that I get to join  Wende this weeked
for this trip; I didn't know I'd be able to until just
before Karla left work.  I'll relay that story
inderectly later.  It was wacky.</p>

<p>I  purchased two postcards at Love's  to write to
my friend Jenifer who I met at the Conention Center in
Los Angeles.  I think I have her address with me.</p>

<p>Okay; we are leaving now.</p>

<p class=date>midnight-ish</p>

<p>We arrived and pretty much went straight to
sleep.</p>

<p>Wende gave me a kiss as she left for work.  As she
was walking down the stairs, I had a startling
realization.</p>

<p>'Hey!  I don't have any way to get to work!'</p>

<p>I bounced out of bed and got ready; Wende took me
to work.</p>

<p>My dream:</p>

<p class=dream>Got some  cool coins in the change I
received, including:</p>

<p class=dream><ul>
<li class=dream>2002 penny</li>
<li class=dream>2002 sacagawea dollar</li>
<li class=dream>penny with the face not stamped</li>
<li class=dream>dollar with the  planchet not round
(like when cutting biscuits, sometimes the cutter will
cut over the same section, making a 'dent'  in the 
circle)</li>
</ul></p>

<p class=dream>I was specifically like, I'm glad this
isn't a dream; these are great coins!!  Wow!</p>

<p>It was a dream.  Doh!!</p>

<p>I now know why the server went down last night, and again this morning
around 3 am.</p>

<p>It got too hot and stopped.  Or, more precisely, the CPU stopped but the
machine did not do a "shut down" and write data to disk, etc.</p>

<p>I purchased 5 bags of ice and them in a trashcan in front of the machine,
and put a fan blowing across the back.</p>

<p>Hopefully that will fix it at least for tonight until the air conditioner
is back on in the building.</p>

<p class=date>6:02am</p>

<p>As I was leaving the office, I checked the server once more.  No
response.</p>

<p>Fuck!!</p>

<p>I put buckets of ice all around it and called Kevin and everything seems
to be working fine now, but this shit has got to be resolved!</p>

<p>Calm and working fine.  Yes, everything is working fine.</p>
