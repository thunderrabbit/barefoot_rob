<p><p class=date>9:35PM Saturday 1 Aug 1992</p>

<p><p>I did get 3 days of pay at Kroger.  Tomorrow is my last day.  I
also got to work register 1 today.  Coolness.  Chris Greer, who does
the scheduling, gave me 6AM to Noon tomorrow.  Cool.  Then he wrote
out across the rest of the week, &ldquo;Have a good life, Robmeister.&rdquo;  Heh
heh.  A customer today said while Chris was right there, &ldquo;See you
later alligator, After awhile crocodile, after supper mother fucker.&rdquo;
HA!  That was funny.</p>

<pre>

Today I read several chapters in Wishcraft.
I think I need to redetermine my goals... Barn
raising is quite a cool technique.  I shall
use it with Heather.  I feel confused about
what my goals are..

<p><p class=date>8:11 AM 31 July 92 Friday</p>

<p><p>(My hand can&rsquo;t concentrate on writing right)</p>

<p><p>The summer Olympics have been on.  Very cool.  I stayed home last
night and watched womens&rsquo; gymnastics with Fred.  The female I lust
after is Kim Zmeskal.  For swimming, it&rsquo;s Anita Null.  Actually,
there&rsquo;s a female diver I like better than Null.  I&rsquo;ve forgotten her
name though.  Mary Ellen ______  She is built. I would love to give
her a back massage.  All of them.  I&rsquo;ve gotten to the point that I
want to start gymnastics again. - -</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ve just spent 10 or 15 minutes imagining being back in the gym.
I think I&rsquo;ll do it.</p>

<p><p>Yesterday I spent most of the day at UH.  I figured out my 1040X
form for 1990.  THe government owes me 308 dollars.  Killer.  It will
take a few months to be processed, hence Laura says, &ldquo;it will be
pennies from Heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I met a girl named Yolanda in the library.  She was pretty funny.
I traded phone numbers with her and she called last night while I was
talking to Laura, so I let her go.  Oh - I borrowed Pierre&rsquo;s Windows
3.1 disks and installed Windows last night.  I like it a lot better
than the Windows I used to have.  I mean, I can pop up a Dos window
and all kinds of shit.  I didn&rsquo;t fully explore everything, but it
emits sounds through my Sound Blaster.  Total coolness.</p>

<p><p>Laura is coming over today after work.</p>

<p><p>I got my budget figured out and I have enough fundage to last
through the semester.  Later</p>

<p><p>Hey Hey Hey remember to ask me about the fine girl in the BMW at
the corner of W Gray &amp; Montrose.  She was totally cute and had chopped
short blonde hair and was looking around and had lots of energy.  She
put her arm out the window and got poked by the door lock thing.  She
pushed it down like, &ldquo;there!  job well done!&rdquo;  and she looked over at
the other lock and watched it go down and nodded her head like,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;ll teach you, lock.&rdquo;  She looked over and saw me; I had been
totally infatuated with watching her.  She smiled a big smile and her
eyes kinda lit up and she gave me a thumbs up at the same instant that
I waved.  I then gave her a thumbs up ans she asked, (using charades)
&ldquo;you want to go smoke some grass?&rdquo;  I shook my head &ldquo;no.&rdquo;  She said
&ldquo;good, I don&rsquo;t either.&rdquo;  We both laughed and I blew her a kiss and
then the light turned green.  She had better acceleration than I so I
flashed my lights at her as I turned into my driveway.  Oh she was
fine.  Later</p>

<p><p class=date>Tuesday July 28 Late (It&rsquo;s probably Wed. by now)</p>

<p><p>We watched Olympics at Laura&rsquo;s.  I totally loved it and started
doing pushups and situps and shit.  Those were healthy chicks on
there.  I watched womens&rsquo; diving and mens&rsquo; gymnastics.  Cool.  On the
way home, I was falling asleep, so I stopped the van on the side of
the highway, wend out into the highway and did 15 pushups in the
middle of the lane.  cool.  Then I was more awake and I went on my
way.</p>

<p><p>Today I got a bunch of day planner shit done.  Very cool.  Then I
went in for my first day in the main pharmacy.  It sucked.  I spent 2
hours with John M delivering IV&rsquo;s and I was thinking No Way.  I will
totally hate this shit.  forget it.  forget it.  So I told Sister
Gemma.  Forget it.  So when Aug 31 rolls around I&rsquo;ll be jobless unless
I find one before then.  I&rsquo;m going to call Olsten temp agency
tomorrow.</p>

<p><p>After I got home, I cleaned my room some and Lucy called.  I went
over and we &lt;! fucked eachother&rsquo;s brains out.  Wonderful.  We did it
in her bed, the shower, her bed again and the living room floor.  In
order to get me hard, she finger fucked my ass (on the bed) that was a
new experience for me&hellip; I came 3 times total and when I got home, my
dick hurt. &gt;</p>

<h1>RIGHT!!!</h1>

<p><p>I called Nishika and cancelled all their shit and I got a return
authorization number (205425) so I should be able to get my money
back. Whew.  I called VISA and they said that since I got a return
authorization number, that it will probably work out OK and all will
be hunky dorey.  I&rsquo;m very pleased to hear that.  Sigh.  I&rsquo;ve been
lucky this summer.  I got $3000 from dad, $1500 from Monner and I&rsquo;ve
gotten my insurance to pay for my titty surgery and I&rsquo;ve practically
gotten my money back from Nishika.  RIGHT!!!  I&rsquo;m going to take a
shower and go to Laura&rsquo;s.  Later</p>

<p><p class=date>9:25 AM Sunday 26 July 1992</p>

<p><p>Heather had forgotten about her girls&rsquo; night out last night, so she
and I didn&rsquo;t get to JAM.  However, I finished reading chapter 5 in
Wishcraft this morning.  Barbara (Author of Wishcraft) suggested that
I start an Actions and feelings jouranl.  She writes, &ldquo;At the top of
each page, write the following:</p>

<p><p><pre>    DATE                WHAT I DID         HOW I FELT&rdquo;</pre></p>

<p><p>Starting today I&rsquo;ll make a note of what I did no matter how trivial
it seems.  Everything I do is a step toward my goal.  So, I begin with
the following Action.</p>

<p><p><pre>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>

<pre><code>D        +----   WID  ----+      HIF
</code></pre>

<p>26 July 92   |   I made the   | Pretty darn brilliant
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-+   following    +&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-
notation: &ldquo;@@@@@@@@&rdquo; across the whole page means &ldquo;begin
Actions &amp; Feelings Journal&rdquo;  &ldquo;#######&rdquo; across the whole
page means &ldquo;end Actions and Feelings Journal&rdquo;  D is for
&ldquo;date&rdquo; WID=&ldquo;what I Did&rdquo;  HIF = &ldquo;How I Felt&rdquo;  Very cool.</p>

<p>The lines such as these &mdash;&mdash;- around D &amp; HIF separate the
columns.  I may not need those if my accomplishments can
be described in fewer words..  But knowing me, I won&rsquo;t
describe anything tritely.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s backtrack</p>

<pre><code>D        |             WID                     |      HIF

                                                   +&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</pre></p>

<p><p>Does this touch stone pass the magic wand test?  Ok ** POOF ** I am
now dead for 1000 years and they still are talking about me.  Totaly
cool.  But what did I do for me?  Who else are they talking about?
What do I really really want?  Heck, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p><p class=date>10:20AM</p>

<p><p>Why am I going to school?  Why do I say, &ldquo;Hey I&rsquo;m not worried about
graduating.  I like going to school.&rdquo;  ?? What&rsquo;s going on here?  Am I
putting off life forever?  Barbara wonders if I really need school to
start having what I want.</p>

<h1>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</h1>

<p><p class=anger>This notation is COMPLAINT MODE!!  I can&rsquo;t fucking do
what the HELL I want to do If I don&rsquo;t know What the HELL I Want!
Fucking Shit is useless There&rsquo;s no way.  I&rsquo;M Going to have to go back
through the whole DAMN Wishcraft book just to fucking start over and
figure out what my fucking touchstone is and I don&rsquo;t have time and I&rsquo;m
Never going to be able to do it and this SUCKS!  AAAGGH Fuck The WORLD

<p><p class=date>7:45AM Saturday, 25 July 1992</p>

<p><p>A couple nights ago I went to Laura&rsquo;s and we watched Dances with
Wolves.  Pretty cool.  I was totally falling asleep on the way home.
Not cool.</p>

<p><p>Last night, Fred and I went grocery shopping.  He and I had been
throwing different groceries to eachother to get them into the cart.
Fun.  Then we got to the bread aisle.  Fred put one load of bread in
the cart and then got another loaf and he backed away from the cart so
he could throw it to me.  He was holding the loaf by the side of the
bag.  He told me to back up some more.  I did.  I told him to grab the
end of the bag.  He did.  We backed up more until we were about 40
feet from eachother.  He swung his arm and tossed it to me, but the
trajectory was a little too steep.  The bread flew up and passed
cleanly into the ceiling by knocking the ceiling panel out of the
way.  The bread stayed up there.  So did the panel, although it was a
bit crooked.</p>

<p><p>I laughed the silent teary eyed laughter for 2 full minutes, while
Fred made a bee-line for the restroom.  Then I laughed audibly for
about 4 or 5 minutes.  Tears were streaming down my face.  My antics
were indistinguishable from crying, so one guy asked, &ldquo;you okay?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I laughed.  Holy shit that was so funny.  We laughed all the
way to the checkout line and then across the parking lot.  Hilarious.</p>

<p><p>Yesterday I interviewed with Sister Gemma about getting the weekend
job in the pharmacy.  I told her I was still working Kroger on the
weekends until Aug 31.  So she basically requested me to work Tuesday
and Thursday until then.  I said Ok, but I don&rsquo;t want to go for
another 21 day stretch of working.  So I&rsquo;ll quit Kroger soon.  I&rsquo;m
going to work this weekend and next weekend at Kroger and that&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p><p>Oh - I told Laura to come on over today at 6PM but I forgot that I
had already scheduled a JAM session with Heather.  I think I&rsquo;ll still
have her come over, since Pierre &amp; Heather want to meet her, and I
told her about Pierre&rsquo;s computer connections (sysop access, etc) So
that should work out OK.  Later</p>

<p><p class=message>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had to bite my tongue several times just to
keep from saying &lsquo;I Love You.&rsquo;  It just seems so natural.  You&rsquo;re so
good to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>(couple days later) (Tuesday 21 July 92)</p>

<p><p>That&rsquo;s what Laura said (in red) to me about 2 nights ago after we
went out to Chili&rsquo;s.  Man oh man..</p>

<p><p>Last night Jodi came over and got her stero.  I went over to her
house to help her move it.  Then we hopped into her (apartment)
jaccuzzi and started to make out and we ended up fucking there in the
hot tub.  Wild.  It was such a cool (hot) feeling to have warmth all
around and to be almost floating there while fucking.  The bubbles
felt great too.  After I came, we were still naked and kinda rubbing
on eachother when 2 dudes came into the pool area (it was 2am) and
laughed a little and pointed when they saw what we were doing&hellip;</p>

<p><p>We got dressed and got out and then we fucked in the shower and
again on her futon.  Then we slept from about 2:45 or 3AM to 8AM</p>

<p><p>I came home and got my Nishika Camera Company shit mailed back so
that VISA can file a grievance against them and I can hopefully get my
money back.  (See May 20th) (See August 4th)</p>

<p><p>Pierre and I just now went looking for a hand gun and sandals,
respectively at Oshman&rsquo;s, Carter Country and Academy.  I didn&rsquo;t find
shit except for Tiddies brand sandals at Academy, but I didn&rsquo;t get
them.</p>

<p><p>Now I&rsquo;m going to UH to get my LISP account straightened out.  Later

<p><p class=date>1am Saturday July 18, 1992</p>

<p><p>On Wednesday I spent the night with Laura.  I got entirely caught
up on Bluewave stuff.  A dude named Homer the Brave and I beat up on
Scout Seven.  Thursday I went to Fred&rsquo;s work and he and Caleb showed
me the Next machines.  Very cool.  Then Fred and I played frisbee all
over campus.  Then we went inside Agnes Arnold auditorium and played
frisbee in there.  We went behind where the stage is and I found a
steel ladder going up into the ceiling.  So I climbed it.  Fred
followed and we ended up in a small &ldquo;room&rdquo; where the air conditioner
sat.  There was another ladder so I climbed it and poked my head and
hands out onto the roof.  I didn&rsquo;t get entirely on the roof because I
could be seen too easily.  Then we went down and to the Cullen water
fountain that&rsquo;s being rebuilt.  They&rsquo;ve got <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> - <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of the concrete
poured.  I walked out onto the concrete where I signed the water pipe.
Each nozzle had a handle on it, so I turned one and sure enough
(squirt) it had water pressure.  So I turned it a lot for just a
second SPRAY!!! I don&rsquo;t know how high it went because I was watching
the handle.  But some sprayed on me.  Fred saw it.  Very cool.  I want
to go out there and swipe one of the handles.  That would be fun.

<p><p class=date>10:40AM Tuesday July 14, 1992</p>

<p><p>Last night Laura came over and helped me fix Blue Wave.  She simply
gave me a new editor (QEdit) which has word wrap and all variety of
hotkey redefinitions.</p>

<p><p>Today I woke up and got started big time on my stuff that I want to
do for my JAM sessions with Heather.  I called and made an appointment
with Dr F. Wooten to get some disposable contacts.  Then I called Dr
Sheffield to get my records from them transferred to Dr Wooten.  Then
I called a shoe repair place and then drove my dress shoes over there
and he will put rubber soles on them.  Then I was driving home and
suddenly (metal dragging on concrete sound) came from beneath the van.
Great.  So I pulled into Birraporetti&rsquo;s parking lot and looked.  My
shock had fallen off!  holy shit!  So I tied it up off the ground and
drove to the Goodyear Tire place.  They said it would be 45 minutes
before they could look at it.  So I said &ldquo;Ok I&rsquo;m going to walk home;
just call me.&rdquo;  So I walked over to Pier 1 Imports and looked around.
I picked up a crazy crazy straw and then I found a barrel with the
very bottom covered with blue marbles.  There was a coffee cup with
the handle broken off and a sign that read, &ldquo;Blue or Peach marbles
$.48 per cup&rdquo;  I grabbed about 8 marbles.  I took them up to the
counter: Straw, clickclickclickclickclick 8 marbles.  She looked and
said, &ldquo;uh, where&rsquo;d these come from?&rdquo;  &ldquo;There was a barrel back there
that said 48 cents per cup, but I didn&rsquo;t want that many.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Hmm that&rsquo;s
a far cry from a cup.  Don&rsquo;t you want all of them and get them off my
hands?&rdquo;  &ldquo;How much would all of them be?&rdquo;  &ldquo;<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> off 48 cents.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Ok.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>So I went back and got the whole barrel and brought it up front.
She loaded them into a bag (about 5 cups worth) &ldquo;Do you want the dust,
too?&rdquo;  &ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;  So I got the dust and the popsicle stick and 5 cups of
blue marbles and one(1) peach marble and a crazy crazy straw for
$1.27.  Killer.</p>

<p><p>I left, feeling like quite a shrewd business man.  Then I stopped
by Mrs Baird&rsquo;s Thrift shop and bought 4 apple pies and 1 pineapple
pie.  Then I came home and wrote this.</p>

<p><p class=date>11:20AM</p>

<p><p>The Goodyear people called and said $135 to put the shocks on.  I
thought, &ldquo;no way.&rdquo;  So did dad so I called them back and said &ldquo;No
way.&rdquo;  I&rsquo;m leaving now to go pick it up.  Later</p>

<p><p class=date>11:59PM</p>

<p><p>I uploaded 68 messages to the Castle today.  A new record for me.
I&rsquo;m talking to Laura right now.  Later</p>
