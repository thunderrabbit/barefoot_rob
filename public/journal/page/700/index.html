<p>I'm at home for lunch right now.  I parked at a parking meter under
Pierce Elevated.  I put enough money in for 9 hours.  When I went to
lunch, so that no one could use my time, I put a brown bag that said,
"Out Of Order" over the meter.  Pretty sneaky...

<p>I got a picture of Joy today.  It is so so beautiful - taken
outside with leaves and trees everywhere.  Very nice.  Later  Love Rob

<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)</p>

<p><p>The zoo was cool.  We went to every exhibit, except that I noticed
we did not see girraffes.  The reptiles were cool.  This will all be
written haphazardly, since I want to write about what just happened.
At the zoo, we saw a huge ass <em>green moray</em>.  It was in a tank
with a nurse shark and a lemon shark.  We saw some huge ass snakes,
too.  We saw the gorilla do this (on his back the entire time): Long
slow lazy scratches on his belly, scratching toward his crotch,
flipped his back legs up by his ears, long slow scratches from chest
to crotch.</p>

<p><p>We saw lions doing weird stuff.  (I think one was in heat and the
others were trying to hump her) But one of the lion&rsquo;s tail was being
chewed on by the 3 lions including herself.</p>

<p><p>At Emerson, I met Amy &amp; Janna, daughters of Jan, minister of
Emerson.  They were pretty.  After the thing, me, Cheri, &amp; Ma stopped
by Transco falls and the City Hall Christmas lights.  I took Cheri
home and then came home to Tomball.</p>

<p><p>Just now, Fred said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see who can eat the most sweet tarts.&rdquo;
I said, &ldquo;Crud. I had wanted to save some for tomorrow..&rdquo; We each
crammed 27 Sweet Tarts into our mouths.  Try it.  We could not chew.
We started to laugh - cracking up laughing. Dying laughing.  We had to
go outside so as to not cough them up on the carpet.  I started to
choke and spat them into my hand.  Fred couldn&rsquo;t chews them and
drooled them off the porch into the grass.  He said, &ldquo;Oh Well.&rdquo;  I
started cracking up more and spat them back into my hand and then
threw them as far as possible.  HA HA HA.  We were dying laughing.
Tears &amp; the whole works.  It must have been a location joke, though,
since you&rsquo;re not laughing.</p>

<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)</p>

<p><p>The party was really cool.  By chance I ended up exchanging gifts
with Dream Keeper.  I got a Lego set #6259, &ldquo;Broadside&rsquo;s Brig.&rdquo;  It&rsquo;s
a jail cell for pirates.  Very cool.</p>

<p><p>At the party, we played charades and Master Clue.  One of my
charade things was a bid for &ldquo;Burke&rsquo;s Law.&rdquo;  I got it for 45 seconds.
I intended to say &ldquo;rhymes with -&rdquo; . well, I did say that.  I got this
across: Rhymes with &ldquo;burp saw.&rdquo; Close, but no banana&hellip; Oh well.  When
I first played, I asked what color we were.  Black Magus (Caleb) said,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;re neon, and we&rsquo;re going <em>that</em> way,&rdquo; since our marker was
bright orange.  We refined the quote to be &ldquo;we&rsquo;re xenon&hellip;&rdquo; so that
the color would be correct.  Castle dwellers present: Speaker to
Database, Black Magus, Shadow Thief, Myrridin, General Chaos,
Weaponier, Tara, Windy the Wise, Dream Keeper, Night Mage, Thunder
Rabbit (me, of course), Wandering Programmer, and that&rsquo;s all.</p>

<p><p>Dude.  on the way there, I got stopped by a train with many many cars(?) like this:</p>

<p><p><pre></p>

<p><p>Oops.  I fucked it up.  Let me try again.  (Ha Ha (evil laugh) you

<p><p>There were at least twenty of this type of car.  The things were
regular length, but sharing a set of trucks between them.  It was
quite interesting.  Each of them had five (5) cars &amp; six (6) sets of
trucks.</p>

<p><p>Today I went to Tomball &amp; gave Dave about 10 megs of software for
his new computer.  Mostly .GIFs, including lots of x-rated ones.  Man-
they look great on his VGA monitor.</p>

<p><p>Sigh. It&rsquo;s 10PM.  Kiera was supposed to call me an hour &amp; a half ago.</p>

<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)</p>

<p><p>Only 4 days until Christmas.  Crud.  I&rsquo;m not ready.  Anyway, here&rsquo;s
a summary of my life: wait wait&hellip; Here are the top 15 (not) 10 things
that are important to me right now. (Not in any particular order)</p>

<ol>
<p><li>Tonight is the Castle of Dreams Christmas party.  It actually
started 30 minutes ago, but I'm waiting until after I pick up Tammy
from work before i go.  She may or may not go.  If not, I'll get to
stay out later.  We'll see.  We're exchanging "Castle oriented" gifts.
Mine comes from my favorite tagline: "... Oh and here is your key to
the restroom."  I've got a skeleton key that I'm painting with
glittery nail polish.  I wish it was opaque, though. (the polish, that
is)

<p><li>Kiera is about to call me.  I sent her a Christmas card & asked
her to call me.  She didn't have my number, so she told me so in a
recent letter.  I called her & she's supposed to call me back within
43 minutes.

<p><li>I doubt I'll get 15 things down here before then.

<p><li>School is out, and I miss all my friends from the dorms.  I got
a letter from Laura today, so that was really nice.  I'm going to send
her a 1969 penny & some "Hershey's Kisses" paper strips.  I'll also
send her a postcard of a cow with the word COW written boldly across
the back.  She'll love it.

<p><li>I've decided to write a program to keep track of my budget.  I
want to keep my double entry system like I'm doing on paper now.  It
will be a tough program, but I'll just do lots of flow charts & get it
done correctly.

<p><li>I intend * to do some preparation for my classes next semester.
Or, to be more precise, I intend to do some preparation during the
holidays for my classes next semester.  Yeah.  Anyway, I'm going to
buy the Assembly Language book & read it.  I'm also going to review my
calculus & trig stuff.  I'm taking Calculus III next semester and I'm
not ready for it.  I will study it before school starts.

<p><li>I need money.  I've recently taken the responsibility for
paying Tammy's & my rent, and I payed to get the van fixed.  St Joseph
is going to close the Outpation portion of the Pharmacy on Saturday,
so there goes 1/2 my income.  Not cool.  I'm going to have Tammy help
me write a resume' and I'll call Methodist Hospital, which recently
had an ad out for Pharmacy Techs, and I'll call some temporary
agencies & try to get a job that way.

<p><li>Another money making scheme I've decided to pursue is donating
sperm.  I've gone to the place to get the application.  I'm going to
take that to my parent's tomorrow and have Ma help me fill out the
family genetic history.  I'll get $40.00 guaranteed, and then
"excellent compensation" for each time I donate after that.  I think
it's $50 per squirt.  Cool.  If that's the case, I can make an extra
200 dollars per month.

<p><li>Dave is in town, and I'm going to get his new computer & my
computer together to do some software swapping.  He recently got a 386
IBM compatible.

<p><li>Birraporetti's was super fun last night.  I saw Ann, my
beautiful cute blonde neighbor waitressing there.  She saw me first,
actually.  I bet she makes a fortune in tips.
</ol>

<p><p>Well, how about 10 things.  That&rsquo;s about all I&rsquo;m going to get
without being too silly.  I&rsquo;m going to get cleaned up and go to pick
up Tammy &amp; then go to the party.  Later.  Love Rob</p>

<p><p>* Kiera called to say she&rsquo;s going to the movies.  She&rsquo;ll call me
tomorrow at 8:30.</p>

<p>(not proofread)</p>

<p class=date>Sunday 11 February 1990</p>

<p>I just got back today from the 1990 Dallas Rally.  On Friday I
picked up Fred (my brother) from his house & we met Rick E and Mike O
at 6pm.  We left in Rick's truck shortly afterward.  We got there at
about 10:something & not many people were there.  I got a mesage to
call my mom (She's going to school at SMU, which is very close to the
church).  I called her and she invited me to come see her apartment.
It was neat.  Very small, but neat.  She has a little kitchen sink &
table & couch & her computer where the T.V. would be.  I met her
friend Lilliann ("Lilly Anne - all one word")  She's really nice.  I
played a little bit of Vegas Gambler while they sat on the couch and
watched... That was fun, but the Rally was calling.  So mom took me
back while Lilliann slept on Ma's couch.</p>

<p>
I got back and saw Joy B and Aaron M again (They got there just before I went to Ma's).  Delayna D was there & Mikael the girl was there.  Opening circle was at 2AM.  We all stood up and said something about ourselves.  Jody K was the first to go.  She was sitting beside me.  Just like my very first Rally, I stood up right after she was done.  I said, "I'm not going last."  Then Dallas D, Alva's sister realized she would be last...
<p>
After the circle, I walked around and talked to different people.  Troy S showed me some pictures.. Including the "Brawn Hand Blender" which he gave me today while we at donuts at the end of the Rally.
<p>
Fred sat by Jasmine -- He held her hand the entire weekend.  Joy sat on my shoulders for a while like last year.  I took Mikael's neat bracelet & wore it for a while.  Delayna and I sat and talked about old times.. Including about Dustin & all those from ConCon 1988.  Delayna & I slept beside each other at about 3:30AM.  We slept till about 7AM.
<p>
We all had pancakes for breakfast.  While standing in line for the pancakes I met Chris - a little guy who I believe is blind or mostly blind.  I helped him get his pancakes & sausage -- & I got him some OJ.  After breakfast I sat with him for a while --I didn't know if he would be ok alone or what.  I finally decided he would be.  I asked if he would-He was..
<p>
For the first workshop I went to Youth Power.  The guy told us how we could do things that would benefit society.  Things that didn't take lots of brains, but very helpful... Like build parks or clean up trash or volunteer in a hospital or whatever.  It was a neat workshop. 
<p>
We had sandwiches for lunch that day - bologna & cheese & ham & mayo.  No lettuce or tomato though... oh well.  Oh - I put chips on mine.  I had 3 sandwiches.  I needed the energy for Ultimate frisbee which we played just after lunch.
<p>
Oh- just before lunch I went to the YMCA with Aaron M to take showers.  I didn't bring my towel so I used his.  I watched some guys play racquetball for a while afterward.  They were good...
<p>
After lunch we went to the YMCA field to play frisbee.  There were some guys already there playing football.  Since we both wanted the whole field, one of the football guys & me & Aaron & someone else who I don't remember his name (he did the meditation workshop..) went into the office to see who would have to go.  The girl there didn't know & she called "Ed" who apparently ran the Y.  He said the church had the field.  Yay!  Me and Aaron thought we were just the baddest dudes in the world after that.  As we walked out he casually put his hand behind him & we gave eachother five.
<p>
Ultimate frisbee was great.  It had rained, so the field was just the right amount of soft.  I made a couple of spectacular catches- one where I jumped way up over a guy & snagged it before he caught it.  It was a totally great game.  I ran & ran & ran.
<p>
After that was the second set of workshops.  I went to the meditation.  I really really relaxed during that.  It was great.  I fell asleep for only a little bit of it.
<p>
After that I went out to the swings with Aaron & Delayna & Joy & Jennifer B (I think that's her name) That was neat.  I got up on the swing set & walked across the bar.  I didn't even fall.. I climbed 3 of the trees out there.  They were pretty good climbing trees.  One had very pokin' bark & it hurt my feet though.
<p>
At one point we went out to the wall & waved at all the cars.  The highlights were the Porsches & BMWs & Mercedes.. The highlight of the highlights was "<em>Lamborghini!!</em>"<br>
We all jumped off the wall - yelling & waving as we ran toward the sidewalk.  The guy saw us & revved up his engine.  The sound was beautiful.  So powerful & cool.  Vroo- Vroo- VROOOOOOOOM!!!  It was completely kick ass awesome.  It was a beautiful red Lamborghini - forgive me for not knowing what model...
<p>
Oh- we quit waving to cars after one driver <b>bumped</b> a van because he was watching us & not the road... 
<p>After workshops & cars & stuff I was part of a circle in the hallway - we did some ohms & then I suggested that we play the squeeze game - I got in the middle & tried to locate a hand squeeze that went around the circle.  I never could find it... So we played the telephone game.  I started the first one: "Three men & a monkey went hunting in the forest with a rainbow."<br>
When it got around, it was something about some people in a parking lot.
<p>
The next one was started - something about pink converse tennis shoes.  Maybe it was, "I bought some ham in my pink converse."  It got around to me: "I will not eat green eggs & sperm I am Sam, Sam I am."  Wow.
<p>
After that Mike A's band was playing.  We went to see them.  It was pretty cool.  They played a big variety of stuff.  Including, "I'm an airplane" & one with a neat neat drum beat.
<p>
After the concert we had the talent show.  It was great.  I did the Fairy Tale with Mike A and I drew a picture of Mike O.  I also sold some Coke (Coca Cola) to Fred.  It was funny.  Carrie did a great mime, "locked in a box".  After the concert I sat with Jennifer and Aaron and Joy and Mikael and we talked and took turns listening to a super cool CD of Aaron's.  It was a German group - I forget their name.  The song was a series of synthesized drum beats in stereo-  cool cool stuff.
<p>
That night I slept alone from 4 to 7AM.  I got up after dying for a few minutes from being so so so so sore. I cleaned up my stuff & then went to closing circle.
<p>
We sang Dear Friends & Yogi Bear & Plastic Jesus & Halls of LRY.  We then did a couple of Colorado hugs on my suggestion, & then we did a spiral - Shane's suggestion.  With 90 people - that got complicated.  But we did it and it was fun.
<p>
We then had donuts outside & exchanged last hugs and goodbyes. I really didn't want to go.  Troy gave me the Brawn Hand Blender picture -  I gave him my address.. I wonder what will happen... Joy told me not to write her - she would write me.  I promised a letter to Jennifer and Delayna.  I hugged everyone again and again.  
<p>
I saw Aaron.  We hugged & I was saying, "shit man..."  No words... I didn't want to go.  I'm going to miss everyone... We left, though.  Rick drove the entire way.  
<p>
We only stopped once - for gas.  Fred and Mike slept all the way; I slept about 1/2 the way.  We got to the church and I put on a name tag: "Hello I'm <b>TIRED</b>."  It was great.</p>

<p class=date>23 August 1988</p>

<p>
I got back from ConCon 2 days ago.  It was so incredible.  There is simply no way of fully describing ConCon - so I won't do it.  But I will of course tell about some of the stuff I did.
<p>
On August 15 my flight was at 12:20PM and I got there with 45 minutes to spare.  I changed planes in Dallas Love Field after a 50 minute flight.  My next flight was from 1:45 to 2:35.  I met up with a bunch of SW District peoples at Dallas.  Joe K, Gayle K, Rockin' Robin D, Deborah D, Paul K, and a couple other people.  We got to Tulsa and ConCon people identified us easily.  Tie dye shirts, Mr. Happy Condom ("Dress well for every occasion") shirts, juggling balls, riped up pants... So they took us to the baggage claim.  I had no baggage so I continued to where our shuttles (cars of nice UU adults) were to pick us up.
<p>
I got on the next shuttle with 3 other youth.  We were driven to the YMCA where we waited until the bus to take us to the camp.  At the Y, I saw Kelly H again. Actually she saw me first and waded through people to give me a huge hug. She sat on my lap and we talked about old times.
<p>
Eventually there were calls of, "the bus is here!!" echoing through the building.  We piled out of the room to get to the elevator. By the time I got my bags it was almost full but I said, "well, just take my bags" and I slowly put them in the elevator.  Just as the door was closing, I jumped in myself.  There was a big guy in there who was quite impressed. I would later know him as "Donny" (spelled Donne I think) from Michigan.
<p>
We got on the bus which was <b>very hot</b>, like no air condition, and drove for about 1 hour to the camp.  We were the first bus there and we got off in a happy daze. We were directed to the Beacon House to register & choose our workshop. Then we went to the Jet to get our Secret Buddies & make buttons and our mailbag.  My button looked like this:
<pre>

         CON^2 88
         MR. COOL
          yellow
            Rob
              N
</pre>
<p>
except it was yellow and the words were handwritten.
<p>
The workshop that I signed up for was the ropes course.  It was really super incredible. I'll tell about that first.
<p>
Ok- the first day we did different trust things - Trust Falls, Wind in the Willow.  That was neat.  Then we had to group together to solve a problem.  The problem was set in California during an earthquake.  We all had to get on a big wooden spool (halfway stable ground) and get to another spool (completely stable ground) by using a tire, 1/2 a cinder block, and two 10 foot boards.  The spools were 15 feet apart.  We did not have to use all the equipment.  We figured out how to do it in about 10 minutes and we did it.
<p>
The next thing involved a huge spider web (ropes).  It was set in The Dark Forest (or something like that) of JRR Tolkein's <em>The Hobbit</em>.  We had to get everybody through the web without anyone touching the web and without using and of the holes twice.  This was quite a challenge, but we did it in about 30 minutes. Oh- there were 15 people in our ropes course group.
<p>
The next problem involved a giant toothpick (10 foot tall, 10 inch wide steel pipe) sticking straight up out of the ground with 3 lifesavers (car tires) on it. Our job was to get the lifesavers off the toothpick and put them back on in a different order.  rules:  No one can touch the toothpick and only 3 people can touch on tire, 3 different people can touch another tire, and 3 different people can touch the last tire.  We did it.  Chuck and I were bases to get people up high enough to get the tires off and on.
<p>
The last low ground thing we did was the trust walk.  This consisted of 2 X 6 boards bolted to posts in the ground.  We were blindfolded and walked on the 2 inch edge of the 2 X 6s with people holding our hands and telling us where to put our feet.  That was interesting.  Especially since we had people going the opposite direction at the same time.
<p>
This is kinda what the course looked like from above:
<pre>


        |----|
        |    |1
        |    |___
        |       / 
        |      /_____
        |        ____
        |    ___/ 
        |___/ 
          2 

</pre>
Sections 1 and 2 were really steep.
<p>
Also, there were different levels where the boards met - like you would have to step up or down to get to the next board.  After we did all of the low stuff, we were ready for the high ropes course!
<p>
I was the third person to go through it, not including the instructor, Mike, who showed us how.  The course started about 30 feet high in a tree.  We had to use a ladder to get up.  First you walk up a really steep log about 15 feet long.  It was at about a 40 degree angle.  Then we walked along a 3 wire bridge about 60 feet long. Then along a 50 foot long 2 wire bridge.  The next thing was called the cat walk.  It consisted of 2 wires side by side about 1 1/2 feet apart.  It was 12 feet long and 30 feet in the air. (The 3 line bridge started at 35 feet and went down to 30 feet.  The two line stayed at 30)  To cross the cat walk, we had to get down on our hands and knees and crawl across.  In the middle, we had to meow - (it was the cat walk).  Nagel got confused and barked, but that's okay.  Once we crossed that, we had to walk along a level log about 25 feet long - using no hands - just walk across. I did that easily.  Tina, the girl who belayed me was mildly impressed and commented like, "oooooh - look at him go."  I was pleased.  The next thing was a set of three logs all bolted together.  We had to walk or run or trot down them- any which way.  the last two were unsupported in the middle and kind of bounced as you walked across them.  I didn't quite trot, but I definitely went faster than walking across them.  The next thing was a pulley that you rolled down the wire with.  That was neat.  It was about 50 feet long, and we got to go zipping down that.  The last thing was "<em>The Screamer</em>."  A big swing that started about 40 feet in the air.  The wire that it was attached to was about 60 feet high.  We were all tied in and leaned forward... - a bit more, more... and  WHoooooosh!!! we went flying down and up to where we could hit a tree with our foot and then back to give Mike a "high five." Then we just swung until we were almost stopped.  Then some guys slowed us down and unhooked us.  That was so neat.  
<p>
The last part of the ropes course was at the two towers. Each tower consisted of 3 telephone poles like this:  (top view)
<p>
<pre>


        *                0                *
     *  |---------------------------------|  *
        *                                 *

</pre>
<p>
The pole (0) was about 30 feet tall and about 8 feet from the wire (----).
<p>

The two towers were about 60 feet apart.  We climbed on of the towers and rappeled back down.  Normally we would used the zip cord but it was past its warranty date.  That would have been excellent - but oh well.  I climbed and rappelled 3 times.  The last time I got all the way down in one push away from the wall.
The towers were about 35 feet high.
<p>
After I climbed the tower once, I did the last and most amazing thing there.  I had psyched myself up for about 5 minutes before I did it.  I was completely strapped in and then I was ready.
<p>
I climbed the 30 foot pole and stood on the top of it, about 9 inches in diameter.  Hanging from the wire about 8 feet in front of me was a trapeze. It hung about 1 foot below the wire.  I simply had to jump out and catch it.  I focused on the wire and everything else disappeared.  I was mentally standing on ground & I could just as easily walk out to the wire as I could pick my nose.  I just decided to jump out and catch it.  I said, "it's like gymnastics" and jumped.  I felt the trapeze hit my hands and clamped on. I made it. People below were clapping and cheering. I was happy. I did a penny drop off of the trapeze and was lowered to the ground.
<p>
To shorten the story, I'll just say only 2 other people caught the trapeze out of 12 who tried.  The three of us who did it wanted to do it again.  So we came back later in the afternoon.  Graham jumped first but didn't make it. Then Nagel went and didn't make it. I went and made it.  I was definitely Mr Cool.
<p>

<p>
Ok- um - the first night I went to supper and then to my cabin - Cabin 9

<p>
We listened to Beastie Boys and Donne and I acted dump and danced to it.  We went outside and saw shooting stars which was kind of neat.
<p>
A typical day:<br>
Wake up, take a shower, eat, go to workshop (ropes course), go to spirit circle, lunch, free time, touch groups, supper, worship, sleep.
<p>
(3 November 1988)<br>
(It's been over 2 months so my memory is going...)<br>
I spent 3 nights up on Chapel on the Hill.  The view from there was fantastic. You could see out over a valley & part of the lake.
<p>
Chapel on the Hill was interesting in itself. It was just a metal grate floor, a podium, benches and a roof.  The floor was made of like the grate things you see in front of doors to get mud off.
Like this:

<p> the *s are metal and the rest was open air.
So it kind of hurt to walk barefoot on and was funky to sleep on, but the view in the morning was worth it.
<p>
There was a lot of cool people at ConCon<br>
<ul>
<li>Michelle B with a soft voice and nice brown eyes and sweet personality</li>
<li>Chuck G - who was in the ropes course with me and reminded me all the heck of my cousin Peter. He was a big guy.</li>
<li>Jessica B who can dance and smile and climb trees and play frisbee...</li>
<li>Delayna D with her cute as anything nose that would make her giggle when we pressed it.</li>
<li>Adam L, the most peaceful guy.. he made an announcement at spirt circle, "If something pleases you, instead of clapping, rub your hands together like this." (fingers pointing foward rub back and forth not up and down)</li>
<li>Brian M - who was always late to touchgroup was darn peaceful too.  He did a meditation too.</li>
<li>Lisa N, who ate honey while Dustin, Jack and I did our rap at 4AM on the last night.</li>
<li>Parisa P, who was my touch group leader.  She was quiet and dignified and peaceful</li>
<li>Tex - he was a short guy who was quite a riot. He rode the plane home with me. We met lots of people, and tried unsuccessfully to steal the display oxygen mask. We got caught by some lady passenger who told on us.</li>
</ul></p>

<br>(adapted from Book One of my diary)</p>

<p class=date>Friday July 9, 1987 4:20P.M.</p>

<p>Rifle camp was great- There were about 8 guys, including
instructors and over 100 girls! I had fun!  The first day, Sunday we
left Tomball at 8:30AM.  We got there at about 2PM.  We registered- I
got a key for my room.  We went up to our rooms and scoped the place
out.  We unpacked and then went to supper.  It was lasagna.  It tasted
like shit.  I literally couldn't eat it because it made me want to
vomit.</p>

<p>After supper, we went to the communing hall to get oriented and be
put into our different groups.  We met Kelly Cole, the camp director.
I met her afterward and found out that I was alone in my room- no
roomate- because I was the oldest.  I ended up in the intermeadiate
rifle class.  I wasn't in advance because I couldn't do doubletime
fast enough.  Lynda, Kelly, and Angie were in the advanced group.  The
rest of us were in intermeadiate - Keesha, Ann, Joe, Me, a dude named
Jay and a guy named Kelly were in there, too.  Kelly ended up going
down to beginner because he couldn't pull doubles every time.  Carlos
taught Advanced Rifles.  James taught Intermeadiate.  Trish taught
Beginner.  I wanted to be in advanced <em>so</em> bad.  We just
learned a few basic things the first day.  Then at about 9:0 we went
back to the dorms.  I ran around a little meeting people, and getting
the girls to notice me some.  Kelly Cole gave each room a piece of
paper to decorate and put on the door.  Mine is now in my letter box
in an envelope.  It's a blue paper.  I told everyone to sign it and
they did.  Lights out at 10:30.  I took a shower and told Joe to wake
me up.  he did at about 6:20.  I got up, put my contacts in, and got
dressed.  Went out of my room and waited for someone to go to
breakfast with.  I think I went with Lynda and Ann.  We ate.  It
wasn't bad.  then at 8:00. We had to be in the Communing hall again.
I tried to get into the advanced group again, but didn't make it.  I
didn't want to be in there quite so much after that.  Monday we were
numbered off into 3 groups.  I was in group 3 with Kelly, Keesha,
Laura, Kristin. (sp?)  (Kristen?)  I was doing rather terribly.  We
had to put it on the next day, Tuesday.  Also Monday each group
(Beginner Inter. etc.)  Started to learn a different routine.  I was
all screwed up on that one, too.  But we only had to learn <em>it</em>
by Thursday.  Monday there waas a talent show.  I wasn't in it.  Oh,
Well.  We went swimming, but it was boring.  I just flirted with
Lynda.  That night, a lot of us watched a band perform on TV.  I gave
Linda a foot massage.  We went to bed.  I took a shower and all.  Joke
woke me about 6:10.  I went to breakfast Tuesday with Jay and Kelly
and group... Liz Sylvia Melissa Janie, and Laura?  Tuesday we worked
on our routiens.  During break I just sat with Lynda.  She lay back on
me- like Christy in the '86 Houston Rally.  That night we performed
our first routine.  We did good.  I messed up in one place- oh well.
We got first place, thought.  Yeay!  The ribbon is hanging by my
door.  After we went in for the night, I took a shower and then
propped my door open with my rifle, then went down to Lynda's room.
later a girl came by with a cap like mine.  I said "where'd you get
that?"  (I got mine at Wendy's)  she said, "Your room.  Where else?"
"Woah!"  I went down there.  One girl was wearing my name tag.
Another my cap.  Someone was wearing Joe's hightops.  They were
jammin' to Beastie Boys on Joe's Jam Box.  They didn't mess any of my
stuff up.  Cool.  Wednesday Joe woke me up by kicking my mattress.  (I
had it on the floor in the middle of my dorm.  Don't ask why.)  I went
to Breakfast with Kelly I think.  During Break, I went swimming.. We
played water volleyball.  I met Harla there.  That was fun.  She has a
fine ass.  Lynda didn't want to play.  I don't know why.  A girl named
Mandi was there.  I invited her to play, but she didn't want to
either.  I actually just wanted to meet her.  That night we had the
Olympic games.  We were all split up into 5 groups.  I was in group
4.  Each person had to dribble a basketball up to a mat, throw it to
the next person, who just held it, do 2 summer saults on a mat,
jumprope to a bat, run around that bat 5 times, step into a box, step
in the next box, bring the first one around to the front, step in it
again, etc- then sit down, put your hands over your head, say, "Mary
had a little lamb.  Mary had a little lamb.  His fleece was white as
snow.", then push a balloon with your head to a softbal, put the
softball between your feet and jump over to a table with 5 pieces of
pop corn on it, eat the popcorn with out using your hands, run back,
and tag the person with the basket ball.  Our team came in absolutely
last.  Kelly (the guy) ended up doing the whole thing alone.  All eyes
were on him.  Except for whoever was watching me cheer him on.  I was
out there, "Yay! Go!Go!Go! We can still win it!" Oh, Well.  That
night, we were allowed to stay up until 12:00.  I sat downstairs with
Lynda.  She sat in my lap for a while. :) Ann ordered pizza.  I
flirted a <em>little</em> with Harla, and her friend Marian.  Thursday
I woke up.  Wow, um- It was a normal day until break- We had to pack
to leave.  I packed real fast and then went swimming with Harla.  She
was the only other person there except for a lifegaurd.  We played
volleyball until about 3:50.  I invited both lifegaurds to see us
perform that day.  They said maybe.  I put all my stuff in the van.
Then I turned in my key.  I saw Harla there.  She didn't look too
good.  She said her boyfriend was giving her crap about being with
other guys.  What a jerk.  I got her address, and Marian's.  We went
to the Communing Hall.  We performed.  I did perfectly.  We all
did. No one dropped their rifle.  We were happy.  After we performed,
it was time to go.  I hugged a whole bunch of people and everything.
It was similar to leaving a rally.  On the way back, I major flirted
with Lynda.  We all talked about a lot of different stuff.  Like when
Kelly turned the light on and said "Psyche!" to Keesha.  Or said,
"Keesha!  Listen!  It's a rattlesnake!"</p>

<br>I was in color guard for a while&hellip;..I couldn&rsquo;t twirle a rifle but I could a sabor (if that&rsquo;s how you spell it) and a flag but I did better at tossing the sabor than I did twirling it but I could still do it. i&rsquo;ve only done color guard for one year and now I&rsquo;m a cheerleader and I was two years before that too.So yeah I was more of a cheerleader but then turns out I was one of the best on the team&hellip;.<br>
