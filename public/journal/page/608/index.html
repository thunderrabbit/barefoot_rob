<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>explaining to my boss kevin why having playstation at a rally is better than trying to set up a playstation workshop&hellip; just have it available and people will play it whenever they want instead of trying to force the fun to happen at a certain time.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was watching movie set in the old west mexican american war and the bad guys rode into town and said, &ldquo;here take care of my bosses head&rdquo; and the head had beeen severed, some spanish curly locks conquistador with moustache and he threw it at the townsfok and they shouted &lsquo;outlaw!&rsquo; and started chasing him out of town and a big gunfight broke out and the bad guy decided it was hopeless and shot himself in the mouth and didn&rsquo;t die so he tried to burn himself to death and wouldn&rsquo;t die and it was (the movie) was supposed to be a comedy, but I was grossed out and quit watching it.</p>

<p><p class=dream>at my old apartment, a guy drove up the driveway ramp with his old red and white convertible  car 60&rsquo;s classic something and had a bicycle in the back , which he locked up at someone else&rsquo;s apartment and the someone else came down the stairs and was mad so he moved the bike out of the way and was all, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get out of my stairs so tie up your bike somewhere else&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>the bicylce owner didn&rsquo;t confront the guy, but got mad and I offered some ideas for how he could hang the bike inside..  He lived in Suzanne&rsquo;s old apartment, and when I went in, it was really huge inside, 2 story ceilings with large large rooms although still old inside.   he had put a large cloth divider between the living room and dining rooom for most of the width of the room, but there was one section open.  my idea was to use a system of pulleys to raise the bike all the way to the top..   to hang the bike and raise it all the way to the ceiling.  He said he had thought of that, but didn&rsquo;t want to sepend the time to do it.  I was all like, &ldquo;fine that&rsquo;s your chocie..&rdquo; but I asked, &ldquo;how much is it worth to you to have this done?&rdquo;  He said &ldquo;my monday&rdquo; I guessed referring to it was worth working during Monday to get it complete. I was all, &ldquo;I look forward to seeing it!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>As I left work, huge storm clouds rumbled in, and I raced them
home.  A few sprinkles got on Scott (who actually needs a bath), and I
raced inside to put on swim trunks and T-shirt.</p>

<p><p>Grabbed a towel and put it by the front door.  Stepped outside into
this storm.  Astonishing wind like 35 with long gusts of 50 miles per
hour, crashing raindrops into my face and body.  I wondered about the
sanity of this, as lightning struck in various locations less than <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
mile away from me.  I offered the question up to my higher self, who
said <em>you&rsquo;re safe (just keep walking)</em>.  I walked to the middle
of American General parking lot, which had about 3 cars in its
expanse.  I could watch gusty sheets of rain running across the lot,
some greeting me with cold stinging drops.</p>

<p><p>I got the higher self message to keep moseying out of the middle of
the parking lot and as I reached the edge, walking under some trees,
<em><b>CRACKKKKWHAM!!</b></em> lightning struck back behind me, I
ducked away from it, startled and winced away from the ringing in my
ears.  I bounced with energy &ldquo;WHOOOO!!&rdquo; that was close.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m guessing the bolt struck a light post in the parking lot, but I
didn&rsquo;t carefully examine it for damage.  Kept walking out toward Allen
Parkway.</p>

<p><p>Terrific wind and rain as I approached Allen Parkway, and no
lightning quite as close.  I repeated a mantra of &ldquo;I am safe&rdquo; as I
walked.  Crossed all 9 lanes (2 for exit ramp to Montrose, 3 each way
on Allen Parkway, 1 for entrance ramp from Montrose) and walked down
into the trees of Buffalo Bayou.</p>

<p><p>I got a feeling of Not-Safe as I walked down amongst the trees, but
I&rsquo;m not sure if it was a higher self message or an ego-level message.</p>

<p><p><em><b>CRACKKKKWHAM!!</b></em> lightning smashed into the ground
probably 500 feet behind me, making my other ear ring.  I took the
hint and walked back toward home.</p>

<p><p>I modified my mantra from &ldquo;I am safe&rdquo; to &ldquo;I am healthy&rdquo;, which
seemed less likely to be misconstrued by lightning.  Walked through
the lower level of American General parking garage as a protective
measure.  Air bubbles blurted up through the standing water around the
water drains in the garage.</p>

<p><p>By the time I had gotten to West Dallas street, the storm had
certainly passed.  Lightning was now mile away on the south side of
me. (it had come in from the north).  Almost no rain as I reached my
house.  But I was certainly soaked!  Good thing I had put a towel by
the door.</p>

<p>At Molly's house right now, and have just helped her peel some hard boiled eggs with which to make deviled eggs.  I told her that deviled eggs are the only eggs I know how to make when she asked if I had had them before. 
<br>then she asked how I like to make them.  Melanie asked something before I could answer, so I didn't answer.  Answer would have been like, "break the eggs, mix them up in a bowl with a bit of milk and cook them in a skillet."   Molly would have laughed her "heh" or "ha!" laugh.  

<p>Before coming out here, I stopped by Paint This to see Jennifer, who I met at Mad Potter.  Jennifer appears <em>so calm</em> compared to back when I saw her at MP.  She seemed almost manic then, but is way cooler now.  I can just see her whole being is more at peace.

<p class=grafitti>Will was here.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ve been reading about Java 2, the latest version
of Java.  On two different occasions, I had started
learing Java, but never got very far.  Mostly, if I
remember correctly, it was just seemed too difficult
to use a text editor in windows that would save text
files with a 3 char extension, then have to rename
them to .java and then compile and rename the result
to .class .  nevermind.</p>

<p><p>So anyway, in 3 days, I&rsquo;m on day 12 of this 21 Day
book.  I did days 1-8 on the first day, and my
progress slowed a lot after that.</p>

<p><p>But I just made an applet that bounces a little
blue ball around the screen.  Nice.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>This morning at 7am, Wende left for SWUUSI.  It&rsquo;s a
week long camp in Oklahoma.  She&rsquo;s probably pretty
close to there by now.  It&rsquo;s gonna be hot.  She
brought 6 gallons and 6 liters of water so she can
drink 1 gallon and 1 liter of water per day.</p>

<p><p>Tonight is a party at Molly&rsquo;s!!  Sad thing is that
the party will just begin to hop when I have to leave
at 6pm to come do my radio shift at KTRU.  I love
KTRU, but this timeslot is not my favorite one.</p>

<p><p>Tune in tonight!  <a
href="https://www.ktru.org/realaudio.html">www.ktru.org/realaudio.html</a>
7 to 10pm!!!</p>

Lovely Deana,

In a great cosmic way, July 29 just happens to be
a night that I will be in Virginia instead of
Houston.
 
I would *love* for you to cover part of my shift,
and I will now offer to you ... the rest of my shift!
 
Will you cover my entire shift 7-10pm Saturday
July 29?
 
Feel free to say no.  I will begin asking the list
this weekend.
 
     KTRU and you
     - Rob

<p>About 30 minutes ago, we heard large heavy banging sound outside
next door.  Sounded like a big metal dumpster being dropped off, maybe
to hold the house next door.  If that's the case, then our view toward
downtown will change soonishly.  I'll take pictures.

<p>I still trust that the purchase of this house was the right thing
to do, that I did properly hear my higher self.  And I must admit,
that mostly I'm expecting that we will make a profit on selling this
house, although my higher self never said that.  (higher self doesn't
care about money)

<p class=date>6:10am</p>

<p><p>I just went outside, fully expecting to see a large bin, but there
is none.  A small dumpster is in the middle of the vacant lot 3 lots
down, but not a large one like I envisioned.  Weird how I nearly felt
let down that there won&rsquo;t be construction to watch next door.  Nothing
for me to climb on immediately, or have a picnic inside before the
walls are up.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Then changing clothes in the locker room like back in high school and college, but this time there were also two girls watching me.  I ignored them essentially (or more like didn&rsquo;t treat them any different that two guys) and changed in front of them.  Instead of shorts I put on my old &lsquo;MC-Hammer&rsquo; jams, but then took those off and went looking for shorts until I woke up.</p>

<p>I'm not entirely looking forward to going to work today.  Okay, I'm
not at all looking forward to it.  Right now I don't have a
-[*PROJECT*]- to work on, so I'm like, <em>sigh</em> and just reading
bored to tears this SAS crap.

<p>So, how can I reframe my feelings around it?  Stupid Stupid stupid
fucking stupid SAS bullcarp!!

<p>Heh.. I wrote bullcarp

<p>Allow me a moment...

<p class=date>8:40am</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m not totally sure what&rsquo;s up.  I&rsquo;m feeling anxious in a way -
like I want to be doing something but don&rsquo;t know what I <em>should</em> be
doing.  I think I&rsquo;m going to go to work because that will look good to
my boss.</p>

<p><p>But, you know, fuck that.  I&rsquo;m not expected to be there until 10am
(I hope!) So I think I&rsquo;ll take another meditative moment.</p>

<p>"where are your shoes?"

<p>"in the car."

<p>"you should wear them at least for dinner...  Evelyn has spent all afternoon working on it.  Everything is 'just right' and it's very elegant."

<p>I'm thinking, <em>soo?</em>  

<p><em>Wait wait wait.  Just last night in I-group, I discussed this disconnectivity with my mom.  Maybe I can't reach her at my level, but I can at her own method.</em>

<p>To  honor my mom, I put on shoes.

<p>- - - -

<p>To be sure, dinner was exquisite.  Very interesting that Evelyn prepared all this and served it all, complete with small salad plate, with a bed of lettuce and fruit-filled jello on top,  turkey rolls with sauce and veggies inside, carrots with grapes, and seasoned rice.  Butter passed around on crystal butter 'tray' and butter knife.   rolls in a basket with cloth napkin keeping them warm.  Wow.

<p>And her husband Bill, lovingly accepted and expected and did not help.  That's just 'the way it is' type of feeling.  Weird.

<p class=date>9:48pm</p>

<p>After dinner, stories and stories.  Canada trips taken and described by Evelyn and Bill, Brazil trip taken by Madeleine, her husband Dick and my cousin Peter and his girlfriend (at the time) Jennifer, described by Madeleine.

<p>now looking at Family Tree Maker with Bill.

<p class=date>10:19</p>

<p>lots of pictures and looking through his family tree maker which is simpler than what I had used: Master Genealogist...  it's difficult for me to not say, "mine is better"  Bill has done 30+ more years more work than I, plus traveled around the world gathering information.

<p>Sitting beside Evelyn as she expresses how she has not taken the time to learn all this computer stuff...  how weird to see/hear about all these computer neophytes.

<p>I've always prided myself in being a great teacher, but gosh...  I'd want my students to have some information! I think I'm being prejudiced against his apparent slow pace and deliberation.

<p>- - - -

<p class=date>1:09pm next day</p>

<p><p>The evening was lovely.  I greatly enjoyed seeing the work done by Bill and was nearly inspired to get out all my old stuff again.  Maybe I&rsquo;ll just be in email contact with him, offering data that I have.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m outside, gently watering plants beside our driveway.  Last night in I-Group some men were describing how they had traveled from ages 19 to 24 or so, and I felt really pissed that I&rsquo;ve never done that, especially since my journals are enchanted with the idea.  I mean, I&rsquo;ve taken small trips, but not like a 3 month tour of Europe, or a trip randomly around the world.</p>

<p><p>I expressed my anger and they listened.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you going to trake a trip around riding roller coasters and write a book about them?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Yes, and I never fucking did it so that sucks too. &hellip; and now I&rsquo;ve got this damn house that&rsquo;s tying my ass down.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Tell me about this &lsquo;damn house&rsquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I love it.  It&rsquo;s absolutely incredible and great and I&rsquo;m so thankful to be in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Is it okay to shift your passion for traveling to passion about your house?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>[blink]</p>

<p><p>I visualized what it might mean to be passionate about my house instead of feeling trapped by it.</p>

<p><p>wow!  Passionate about our house!  That is totally perfect!   I felt empowered, invigorated&hellip;</p>

<p><p>Instead of being mad that there&rsquo;s no water faucet on one side of the driveway, as a passionate homeowner, I can install some PVC pipe and make a water faucet on the other side.</p>

<p><p>But for now, as a passionate homeowner, I am simply using the waterhouse to gently water the plants on the other side of the driveway.</p>

<p><p class=date>7:35&lt;/p?</p>

<p><p>oooh big trash pickup just drove up</p>

<p><p>three 14-wheeleers each like a long dump truck, and one with a big scoopin&rsquo; claw looking thing.  In one gulp, the claw grabbed a large pile of dried reeds and tossed them gently into the long dump truck in front of it.</p>

<p><p>They happened to be right under a telephone pole and the guy had to swing the crane down low 270 degrees to get to the pile of stuff.</p>
