<p>We were scheduled to be at the wedding location at 10am to help set up
centerpieces.  I was up and ostensibly ready-within-5-minutes as Fred
repeatedly snoozed his alarm around 9 am.</p>

<p>He was like, &ldquo;they won&rsquo;t be ready by 10am; arriving anytime between 10
and 11 is fine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We arrived around 11:15.</p>

<p>All the centerpieces were done so we left.</p>

<p>Had I realllly cared to be there on time, I could have found another
driver.</p>

<p>Cheers to Fred for driving!</p>

<p>Today we all went to a pizza party including several members of the
family, then Fred and I took Lin to meet our step sister Elise (not
her real name).  We played with the kids outside on the trampoline,
played with the dogs inside the house, and went out for ice cream (Lin
got Cake Batter flavor), some coffee (at a chain), and some yummy
drinks (at a big retailer).</p>

<p>We got back, chatted for a while about injuries, and the Fred left his
jacket when we left for the second party, where we got to see Mike
Alvez and several other peeps, including our step sister&rsquo;s fiance&rsquo;s
friend from the Appalachian Mountains.  I dumped a handful of Japanese
coins into his daughter&rsquo;s hand.  She seemed to like them enough that I
gave them to her after making sure it would be okay.</p>

<p>After the dinner, Lin was hella tired so we took her to the hotel and
then went back to Elise&rsquo;s with the puzzles I got for Fred (except for
the dual maze one).  Played with them for a while, and Elise got down
the other puzzles she had (including two Fred had made for her.</p>

<p>Everyone took a turn on the puzzles, and we determined that the linked
nail puzzle is impossible because every solution showing them on
YouTube shows a different starting cofiguration.</p>

<p>A-star is my suggested name based on the (stage) name for the woman
who greeted us first in a topless bar.  I liked her smile and eyes so
the third time she came up to me to see if we could go for a private
dance, I took her up on it.</p>

<p>We talked about her other talents in art and teaching people (how) to
do their own art.  She recommended some books (one called Opening Up,
which talks about ways of deepening one&rsquo;s own relationships) and
another, the name of which I&rsquo;ve forgotten.</p>

<p>Given that I paid her over $100 for her time and energy, I hope she&rsquo;ll
email me.  (I gave her my card)</p>

<p>Lin and I are chillin on Narita Express #27, 1700 yen each from 品川
to Narita Airport (成田 ah crap I forgot this word)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve just confirmed my packing and buying list was completed on time!</p>

<h2 id="17-07-jst">17:07  JST</h2>

<p>Late start leaving, but we&rsquo;ve just started boarding, 2 minutes after
departure time.</p>

<p>During the delay, I got an extra ticket done for CB.  yay!</p>

<h2 id="19-33-jst-2-33-los-angeles">19:33 JST / 2:33 Los Angeles</h2>

<p>I feel sad that I got pissy when one of the ground crew(?) informed me
that I &ldquo;must&rdquo; wear shoes to get on the plane.  At first I was like, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t have shoes; I have sandals in my bag&rdquo;</p>

<p>When she walked away, I walked away, done no worries.</p>

<p>Well, she sent a local ground crew guy after me.  He smiled and asked
in English &ldquo;where are your shoes?&rdquo;   and I go &ldquo;where are <em>your</em>
shoes??&rdquo; and he laughed.</p>

<p>She came up all &ldquo;you need to wear your shoes&rdquo; (or something like that)
and I put my bag down saying something like, &ldquo;okay jesus fucking
christ&rdquo; and they both went away while I had my bag open, during which
time I determined that I do <em>not</em> have my sandals in this bag; they
are in my checked bag.</p>

<p>So I started walking toward the plane again and Lin admonished me to
calm down.  I agreed that I had acted inappropriately, but when she
was like, &ldquo;so what do we do now without your shoes?&rdquo; I go, &ldquo;we just get
on the plane; they can go get my shoes off the plane if they want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No other crew/staff said anything until I was actually on board.  (safe!)</p>

<p>A flight attendant goes, &ldquo;where are your shoes?&rdquo; and this time I was
more apologetic, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry they&rsquo;re in my <em>checked</em> baggage&rdquo;</p>

<p>she goes, &ldquo;are you kidding me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry; I&rsquo;ve been barefoot for 7 years so I didn&rsquo;t really think about
it.&rdquo;  I didn&rsquo;t explain further that when I was on Qantas, they didn&rsquo;t
bug me.</p>

<p>By the time we were seated (in row 40 because the rows are marked in a
confusing way and the couple designated for row 40 were in our row
(41)), the flight attendant brought me some slippers which Lin
surmised were from first class.</p>

<p>I hope I get a chance to apologize to the first crewmember for acting
like an ass, though I haven&rsquo;t seen her on board.</p>

<p>About 40 minutes before our flight, and I&rsquo;m charging my computer a
little bit away from our gate because I&rsquo;m addicted to my computer (and
therefore it having power) and don&rsquo;t know if I can get a power fix
closer to the gate.</p>

<p>In line at the deli kiosk thing where we grabbed some foodage, We saw
the cabin attendant who gave me slippers.  We chatted for a bit,
including how they&rsquo;d prefer to go barefoot at times, but there&rsquo;s some
kind of rule (probably just to prevent lawsuits) that&rsquo;s in their
handbook.  Weird.  I&rsquo;d like to get a license to go barefoot.  I wonder
if it&rsquo;s good internationally.  hahah</p>

<p>Email to ferp:</p>

<pre><code>We are in LAX, safely and slowly through immigration, safely and
slowly through customs, safely and slowly through security, and
grabbing a quick bite during our 3 hour layover of which less than
an hour remains.

We are due to arrive in Sandy Eigo at 1:47pm local time in
America, the land of the free and home of the litigation!

<h2 id="12-55">12:55</h2>

<p>At 12:56 we started walking to the gate which was just 20 meters
away.</p>

<p>Oh snap it&rsquo;s the gate to the <em>shuttle</em> to the gate!</p>

<p>So we had to wait for the shuttle which had to wait for two planes,
one of which crossed our path.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re about 25 minutes out.  Lin and I both slept well, so I&rsquo;m pretty
sure we&rsquo;ll have no jet laggin&rsquo; issues.</p>

<p>My sinus is quite itchy sneezy&hellip;  while my mouth was chewing the
grape that came with our breakfast, my nose was like, &ldquo;time to
sneeze!!&rdquo; and I had to work hard to override it!  I was thinking, &ldquo;you
guys want some grapes???&rdquo;</p>
