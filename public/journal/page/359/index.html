<p>I've made it past the hump.   Into the far easier few days.</p>

<p>The hump each week is Saturday.  Thursday is okay - not too busy,
but I've just had the weekend, so it's both stinky to have to go back
to work, but the anticipation of the week is worse than the actual
Thursday.  I get there and think, "this isn't so bad"...</p>

<p>Friday is awesome cause I'm at KQ, where we have a bunch of man to
mans or free lessons.  Mostly I gaze out the window at the
construction next door.  Or study the Japanese that I learned with
Ayana that morning.</p>

<p>Saturday is when it hits.  Hafta get up for the early shift (after
having done the late shift), do tons of lessons, well, the same number
of lessons, but tons of people and it's just packed.  I can hardly
find the files for the next class much less write notes on the
previous files *and* find new files *and* design a good lesson.
But.. it's like I'm at peace with that.  It's like, "meh; what more
can I do?"  The good thing is I get off work before dark.</p>

<p>Sunday is not as bad as Saturday, but it's still an early shift,
which is kinda pooey.  But usually we're not as busy.  And the lessons
are all 40 minutes instead of some of them being 45 minutes.</p>

<p>Monday is cake compared to the Sat and Sun.  And it's a late shift,
so I can sleep in.  I don't 100% like sleeping in, but I do it anyway,
cause I can.  I don't even let myself sleep in during my weekend.</p>

<p>Then Tuesday = no work!  I get to speak Japanese as much as I
want/can and have my Japanese class and it's all good.</p>

<p>Wednesday = no work!  Japanese learnin' with Koko and then do
whatever I want until the late shift on Thursday.</p>

<p>It's raining today.  Just drizzling actually.  (Which is more rain,
drizzle or sprinkle? (I think sprinklng is larger drops))</p>

<p>I don't have my jacket; I left it at the lounge on Wednesday and
it's not been convenient to get it (due to work, and I've chosen not
to take a chance of going over there since they are probably closed
before 7am and after 9pm)</p>

<p>So I'm not taking my backpack (computer) to work.  I almost never
need it, and the only reason I can think I'd be like "dammit; I wish I
had it" is if there's a big earthquake today.</p>

<p class=date>7:16pm</p>

<p>No earthquake today, but the storm coming in is almost as cool.</p>

<p>Cool in a different way - cool like this is a part of nature of
which I've seen plenty.  And I've seen storms far cooler than this
one, but this is the coolest I've seen in Japan.  Wind is blowing
pretty effectively and the river is way high compared to normal.  It's
above all the markers I've used in the past to gauge its depth.  so
I've used a new system.  There are 10 levels of blocks visible along
the side of the river.</p>

<p>I've got no idea how many blocks are usually visible, but I can see
the river is far wider than normal.  My sense is that not many more
levels of blocks exist, but that there's the equivalent of a flood
plain below the lowest level of bricks.</p>

<br>my personal opinion is that a drizzle is heavier than a sprinkle. a sprinkle of rain is when it&rsquo;s that misty annoying crap that when you try to wipe it off your windshield just smudges everywhere and makes things blurrier. also, dude yesterday there was a real tornado in houston (sugarland area)!!! crazy crazy shit. and it&rsquo;s been storming here a lot. flooding and cars being stuck places. a good time for imaginations to kick in to gear and pretend that an evil warlord is attacking our primitive village and the tree soldiers who bend and sway in the wind and rain are protecting our little houses.<br>

<p>Frank is getting demolished in basketball.  Oh it's Playstation,
not Sega.  81 to 58 with 4 minutes to go.</p>

<p>I think a shot from behind the half court line should be worth 4
points if it goes in.  And 5 points if it's thrown from the opposite
court's painted area below the basket.</p>

<p>Final score 97 to 76.  Brutal.</p>

<p>(as Frank would say)</p>

<p>Okay. <em>that</em> train was rather crowded.</p>

<p>I just took an 8:30am-ish express from Moto-Sumiyoshi to
Shibuya.</p>

<p>People just push themselves onto the train butt first, using the
top of the door frame for leverage.  People behind them just shuffle
silently backwards, apparently unaware that anything is happening.  No
one complains; no one sighs; no one seems to notice.</p>

<p>Yammered with Frank for over an hour tonight.  Some about Nova (I
gave my phone number to a student, hoping to help her get out of Level
5, where she's been stuck for 3 years(!)), and alcohol problems that
many instructors seem to have (why? maybe cause they are attracted to
Nova and because Japan/Nova encourages drinking?), and about
god/religion.. and about travel in Japan.  Hakone is Frank's favorite
place in Japan now too.</p>

for her to come visit, and what we'll do after Japan ("let's meet in
Hawaii"), and catch up on stuff in our local lives.</p>

<p>Awesome in my lesson today.  All the studying this week paid off.
Ayana was impressed with my progress, though I still don't think I can
really *talk* to anyone out in the world.  Getting closer.  Today I
studied stuff like "I slept 8 hours last night" and "I studied 3 hours
yesterday" and "The library is behind the theater".. Some other stuff
too, but I've forgotten.</p>

<p>I can see progress.</p>

<p>Work is at KQ today.  Easy.</p>

<p>Doug wasn't at KQ last week; he works part time and is here in the
evenings on Friday.  He asked who covered for him, and it took me a
second to come up with Rachel as the answer.</p>

<p>"Where were you?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Eminem."</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>Nice.  He told me a bit about the show, that the Japanese weren't
all that responsive and then I remembered why it took me a bit to come
up with Rachel's name.  I hadn't been here last week; I had gone to
training and then worked at the main office in Kawasaki.</p>

<p>That's why I didn't hit the show on Friday.   Pooh pooh pooh shut
the fuck up about the show.</p>

<p>Good thing is that by attending that training, I was able to level
up a girl today from 7C to 7B.  Ali and I agreed she could be LUed so
we gave her the LU1 and LU2 in two consecutive lessons today.  Rock on
for her.</p>

<p>Yay for janette calling me this morning!  I had just gotten over
the edge between sleepin' and wakin'.  I was lolling about not wanting
to get up and begin my work week, but talking to her tends to be
inspiring.</p>

<p>I need to confirm that I can get off work 4 through 20 September.
I'll ask Steve today.  We're supposed to have been here six months
before we can vacate; that will be my sixth month....  It'll all be
good.</p>

<p>Amazing.</p>

<p>I got a call from Hitoshi, who said he chose someone else to tutor
him.  I told him thank you (I think I confused him with that) and
blessed him and hopes he does well, etc.  I didn't think to ask him
what made him choose someone over me, but meh; whatever.</p>

<p>20 minutes later I got a call from a new possible student named
Shin.  Rock and roll.  I'll meet Shin on Tuesday at 8pm in Kikuna.</p>
