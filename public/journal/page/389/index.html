                        <p class=date>4:34pm CST Thursday 20 February 2003</p>

<p>I just had an interesting set of brainwaves about fame and stuff.
I wonder how much this stems from a fear of being alone and not having
friends, or a fear of letting people down.. versus the excitement of
wanting to be famous and well loved and to create good and positive
things in the world.</p>

<p>I'm moving to Japan for a year.  There are some people with whom
I'd like to stay in touch.  (Janette, Wende, Maggie, etc) There are
some people who I fancy would like to keep tabs on what I'm up to.
(Dad, Ma, etc) There's a whole world of people and things for me to
see and experience and write about, to share those experiences with
other people that I don't know.</p>

<p>I could attempt to keep track of names and addresses, numbers of
letters written, who sent emails most recently, what everyone is up
to, ... really spreading thinly myself and my focii (emotional, physical,
mental energies).</p>

<p>I want to keep in touch with some people on real, legitimate,
shared communications, exchanging emails and letters.  I might call
these people my "friends."  There are some people who have been
friends with me and then things shift and we moved and graduated and
don't see one another as often.  (Gene, Dude, etc) Which of those
friends do I continue to contact?  How do I keep from missing any? (,
, , etc) How do I maintain contact information for them all?  Not
everyone checks email each day.  Not everyone has a snail mail
address.  Not everyone stays in one place forever.</p>

<p>There are some people (mostly women) that I "really want" to stay
in touch with, and find that I don't have the energy to keep up with
them all.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>As I first had this thought process rattling through my brain, I
came to a possible solution of keeping a list of snail/e mail
addresses and sending out snail/e mail updates of my adventures...  I
recognized this to be a form of pimping myself and a way to work
toward becoming famous.  How else does one
(product/person/service/website) become famous besides advertising?
It's either yammering word of mouth, billboards, TV spots, business
cards, doing something 'newsworthy', etc.  Being an interesting,
helpful or useful prodcut/person/service/website keeps people coming
back, increases word of mouth advertising.</p>

<p>So then I would become a self-aggrandizing cat walking around
trying to be famous, under the guise (?) of keeping in touch with
people.</p>

<p>Is that what I want to be?</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Ah, this is interesting.  It seems that *everyone* says, "drop me a
line, let me know how you're doing," etc etc.  And they often really
mean it:</p>

<p>!) They want to know how I'm doing
<br>@) They want to feel loved (by thinking I think of them)
<br>#) They like the way I write or tell stories
<br>$) whatever else</p>

<p>(But!) Not as many people who say "keep in touch" keep themselves
in touch with me.  I certainly say it more than I do it.</p>

<p>So do I come back to writing to those who actually write to me?
Keep track of who wrote what, when, how long, how carefully?</p>

<p>Of course it's not possible (not easily with current technology
that I have available) for me to keep track of all that, and it's
really not what I want to focus on.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>What I'd rather do is just run around and live my life climbing
waterfalls and telling jokes, meeting people and learning new ways to
shake hands, discussing music and learning new languages, inventing
new games and telling old stories, pouring my heart out and supporting
others in doing the same, kissing loving having sex and sleeping late
until hunger calls.</p>

<p>(( I'm going to Japan because I wanted to get a job combining youth
group leadership and overseas travel.  I contacted a company that was
all, "what in-country experience do you have?"  (Um, 2 weeks in
Australia?) So I figured if they want in-country experience, I'll
<em>move</em> to Japan, live there a year and call 'em back.  Teaching
English happens to be something that I seem qualified to do.</p>

<p>I know a million more doors will open as I'm living there.  I'll
hear about other countries I want to experience, other waterfalls to
climb, other sports to play, other music to create, other radio
stations to DJ, etc etc etc etc etc etc ))</p>

<p>This seems like it's on the right track for what I want to do, and
could certainly lead me to more waterfalls, people, countries,
languages, games, etc etc.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Optimally, I think everyone should take care of themselves:
physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually.  Everyone should
basically do what they want to do when led by love to do it.  The only
way I know to affect that in the world is to do it myself.  Do what I
want to do when led by Love as guided by god and my higher self.</p>

<p>So what do I do?  Write in my journal, transcribe old entries, be
down on myself for not doing more?  What the fuck is that about?  I've
traveled to Hawaii, enthusiastically told my waterfall story to
Colleen, listened to adventures in her life with open heart, loving
interest, caring soul.  These things are good for the world!  How can
I possibly think I've not done enough today?</p>

<p>Maybe it's that I've not taken time to sit carefully, meditatively,
listen to that still quiet voice within.  Maybe I need to take a walk
and find another sad looking horse that won't eat free grass.</p>

<p>Hmmmmmmmm.</p>

<p>Now flying over desert mountains, between Charles and Jan, who are
both employees of Southwest.  Charles is going to play football in
Austin (there's a tournament there) and Jan is just coming to chill.
Charles has family in Thailand that owns a 5 star resort and gets to
kick back in style when he's there.  Sweet.</p>

<p>Janette and I ended up in different seats; we boarded 3rd and 4th
to last.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Jan just wrote a song on two vomit bags.  When he finished both
sides of one bag I provided him with another, "just in time."  He
finished and then I was all, "is it a song you're writing?"</p>

<p>"Yeah" blah blah "you know that song 'Oh Sheila' ?"</p>

<p>" 'Oh Sheila, unh unh unh, Oh Sheila' ... naw never heard of it."</p>

<p>We both laughed.</p>

<p>"I helped write that song."</p>

<p>"That was Ready For The World, right?"</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>"You get a penny every time it plays?  A nickel?"</p>

<p>"Believe dat.  It's more than a penny and more than a nickel."</p>

<p>Nice.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Whoah.</p>

<p>Jan's cousin is Tone Loc.</p>

<p><p>The lead singer of Ready For The World is still kickin&rsquo; it solo
style: <a

<p>The landing was like <em>WHAM</em> when we touched down.  No
bounce, but definitely hard hit.</p>

<p>Charles to my left had been looking out the window and then jerked
to safe crashlanding arms blocking face/torso position.  Jan and I simply
bounced and were like, "wow."  Jan said their friend in the other
aisle of seats looked all scared.  Good times.</p>

<p>Charles knew this was the pilot's first flight as FO (First
Officer) for Southwest Airlines.</p>

<p>The flight attendant was all, "ladies and gentlemen, please give a
round of applause for our FO's first landing!"</p>

<p>We all clapped and Jan was all, "if you can talk about it, it was a
good landing."</p>

<p>How true.</p>

<br>I really love your website!  I think it's great.  This is a wonderful idea to share your life with everybody!  I am a flight attendant and get to meet a lot of wonderful people and would have loved to meet you in person.  I got your email address from the guy you met on the plane today, Jan.  I have been knowing Jan for a few years now... and we've also been having great, mind-blowing sex for a while as well.  But that's a whole other show. LOL  He is a very nice guy.  I will be checking your site from time to time to see how life is treating you from day to day.  <br>

Peace and blessings,<br>

<p>Janette and I are at Magnolia Cafe.  Fred will be here soon, and I
assume we'll have funny things to say.</p>

<p class=date>8:54pm</p>

<p>We're calculating the flow of the waterfall, estimating...</p>

<p class=date>9:47pm</p>

<p>Leaving Austin now.  We weren't as hilarious as I had suspected; I
got to tell a lot of Hawaii stories to Fred and some old school YRUU
stories to both Janette and Fred.</p>

<p>But mostly it was great to see Freddo.</p>

<p>We guesstimated 15 square feet of water poured over the waterfall
at 7.3 feet per second =~ 100 cubic feet per second.  But the
calculations were ended when we couldn't get a good estimate for
converting cubic feet to gallons.  Too much trouble to convert cubic
feet to cubic inches to cubic centimeters to cubic liters and then
estimate to gallons.</p>

<p>But mostly it was great to see Fred.</p>

<p><b><em>I LEAVE FOR JAPAN ON MARCH 26!!</em></b></p>

<p>I'm flying in to Narita airport in Tokyo, so it's looking like I
may be placed in or near Tokyo, as I requested!</p>

<p>I don't have my exact address yet, but I'll firm up exact flight

<p>We have made it to San Francisco airport.</p>

<p>The flight was not terribly long nor terribly boring, but the air
was definitely dry on the plane and it took a bit to get my contacts
out.  I slept sideways across three seats with my legs on Janette's
lap, and Janette using my butt as a pillow.</p>

<p>Now chillin' with Reenie a bit until she gets picked up or until we
have to split for our shuttle-BART-shuttle to Oakland airport.</p>

<p>Reminiscing a bit about our trip:</p>

<p>* the cat named Alamo (Al Lemo)
<br>* Alamo going, "shhhh; she's sleeping" at 7:30pm after Janette
laughed on the back porch
<br>* Rita going, "Janette, in Hawaii, we don't sit on tables," when
Janette sat on an outdoor picnic table
<br>* giving a pile of cash to Bernadette the travel agent-ish person
and then showing up at the airport and them saying, "nope, no tickets
here."
<br>* not getting to see lava, but learning about island hopping fares
<br>* chickens and roosters <em>everywhere</em>. (I just did my rooster
impression here in the airport)
<br>* Dolly, the palm branch (yes, it's a leaf, but it's as big as a
branch) shredding dog
<br>* Zach driving us around</p>

<p class=date>10:10am</p>

<p>Janette and I have taken the Bart Bart Bart to Oakland.  I've
plugged in my computer's power thing into the extension cord that's
allocated to power two video terminals of departures and arrivals.
The terminals were off, and the back access door unlocked, so hey,
free electricity.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>"Here, you wanna muffin, Muffin?"  Janette has just brought orange
juice and blueberry muffin!  "Here, you want some OJ, Muffin?"</p>

<p>While Janette was eating her apple, I go, "want some muffin,
Muffin?"</p>

<p>"No thanks.... fruit."</p>

<p>There was a cute(!) stewardess that reminded me of Danielle
Bartley.  I didn't really like her hair, but I liked the looks of her
lips, though I don't like to kiss full lips.</p>

<p class=dream>Mark Leonard was there when I got a job in sales for a
software company and he immediately helped me with some advice that
was wisdom in his mind that I simply didn't have (or actually do cause
it was my dream) he was all, "now what you could do is have some guys
run around and get people to fill out questionaires to prequalify
customers for the software.  Pay these guys maybe per page they turn
back in."</p>

<p class=dream>I was all "should I pay them a dollar per page
(name)?"</p>

<p class=dream>"I wouldn't even pay them that much."</p>

<p class=dream>And it's like bam that was a perfect little plan to
help.  I hadn't even gotten business cards yet.</p>

<p class=dream>Then a guy drove up in a van and was lost.  He showed
me on a map where he intended to go, and apparently got confused with
the opposite-ness of highway 59.</p>

<p class=dream>I showed him where on the map he was, drew out a
correct simplified map of how to get back where he wanted to go,
taking into consideration construction concerns and all that, and oh
and he spoke only Spanish so I was crossing a language barrier as well
and I was really able to help this guy out.  His wife and son were in
the van anxious to go, but me and this guy were really connecting and
it was great.</p>

<p class=dream>They left for a second and he was playing a CD for me
and they came back and I was all, "here they are you gotta go" and he
didn't want to go, but did.  I gave him my adventure card.</p>

<p>The point as I see it from these dreams is that I am better suited
for some jobs (giving directions) than other jobs (sales).</p>
