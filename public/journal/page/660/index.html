                        <p><title>Butts Up</title></p>

<p>(*) Butts Up requires a large wall against which to throw a small
bouncy ball, ground on which to run, a bouncy ball to throw and at
least 5 players.  For the ball, a tennis ball or racquet ball is
good. A baseball or bowling ball is bad.  A superball is a maybe,
depending on the group and the area.

<p>The goal is to not get hit by the ball.  Any player throws the ball
at the wall usually as hard as possible.  Any player, even the same
player tries to catch the ball and throw it at the wall.  Simple.

<p>Chaos ensues when a player drops the ball while trying to catch it,
or is simply hit by the ball and doesn't catch it.  That player must
run and touch the wall before another player throws the ball and hits
them with it.  Often, in a scramble to hit the other player, the
second player will drop the ball, and have to run for the wall.

<p>If someone hits the player who dropped the ball before that player
touches the wall, it's time for "butts up"

<p>Each player who dropped the ball and was subsequently hit by
another player has to crouch down at the wall with their butt in the
air to be pegged again by the player who got them, and/or by each
other player in the game!

<p>So that is Butts Up.  We were playing Wall Ball which is different
in that the player who dropped has to touch the wall before another
player hits the wall with the ball.  And the butt in air aspect is not
there - it's simply spread eagle and a light to medium toss by a
single player as "punshiment"

<p class=date>Sunday 18 October 1998</p>

<p>What a wild weekend! To give you a visual of sorts, let me say that on Friday, I shaved my head. I shaved it again Saturday morning and again this afternoon.

<p>The bulk of this weekend I spent at First UU Church of Houston with youth for Construct-O-Con, where Houston area youth gathered to design a much larger conference that will be held at my church in January.

<p>Friday afternoon before the thing, Jason Fricke called and was all, "yo, you wanna go skating?"  Yes.

<p>So he arrived at my house like around 3pm and we drove over to Hermann Park area to skate. Quite a duo we must have looked..  He was on skateboard, with shorts and white tanktop and no pads at all. I was on inline skates, fully padded, with fat knee pads, wrist guards and helmet.

<p>We mostly skated around a few steps and a couple of ramps (not designed for skating, but part of the Miller Outdoor Theater). It was just a beatiful fall day and we just experienced our own playfulness. We hardly interacted more than, "oh cool did you see that?" or "watch this..." before trying a new skill.

<p>We expanded our boundaries and I skated, jumping from bench to bench, along a sidewalk toward the Houston Zoo. By the duck lake we waved HI to the few people riding the little train around the park..  (You know, I've never ridden that train...)

<p>Oh crap.. as I'm typing I just realized I'm not writing a skating adventure; I'm writing about the whole weekend lock-in!

<p>Okay, I got a call from Christina on my cell phone and she asked for our help with the food. We had just been en route to The Medical Center (to play around more steps and stuff) when she called.  We got back to the car and I got my skates and pads off just as it started to rain.  Perfect timing!

<p>To Christina's work we picked up a big pile of food, including a tub of sugar cookie dough. Jason and I taste tested it a few times to make sure it was good.  It was good.  Yup, still good.  We were laffin', squirting dough between our teeth and having a great time!

<a name="buttsup">
<p>Then zipped to the church, dropped off the food, then to my house and got cleaned up. (We each played pinball on my computer while the other showered) To the church we arrived fashionably late and the whole group played wall ball most of the night.
"Wall ball" is essentially the same game that I played in high school called "butts up."  (*)

<p>As a group we joined the CUUPS (something UU Pagan Society) group for their worship. It focused on Samhain, "that time of the year when the veil between the physical world and the after world is the thinnest" and we all were given the opportunity to talk about people we know who have died. The sharing was a bit heavier than I expected, and though I personally felt fine afterward, some of the youth had cried about some of the deaths.. so I thought a "decompression session" would be appropriate after the worship.

<p>So we talked a bit (without the CUUPS) in our own group where I hoped the youth would feel safer to get out anything they needed to. I encouraged a couple who needed it to experience their sadness or anger or whatever, but to certainly not bottle up those emotions!

<p>I think it went well.

<p>I was up until about 3 that night; I didn't watch whatever movie they watched until 5am.

<p>Woke up, zipped home to get my cell phone charger, and used the opporunity to shower and again. I used that opportunity to shave my head again; my hair felt like sandpaper after almost 24 hours of growth.

<p>Wall ball wall ball wall ball until lunch then more more more until other youth arrived and then at about 5pm we started our rally planning.

<p>There were several new youth who had never been to a rally, so I gave an overview of them and had the experienced youth give their versions.  Then we figured out who would organize what for our rally in January.

<p>The theme will be "Fricke's Fiesta Con Queso" (for any of you YRUUers out there, this is your sneak preview) and the whole thing will be centered around Salsa, queso, and anything spanish we can think of.  We'll even look into getting sponsorship from Taco Cabana.

<p>Two hours later we had the whole overview complete, with various youth volunteers to be in charge of the various aspects, and me as overview coordinator type person. kT took notes.

<p><hr align="center" width="25%">

<p>Then some real interesting dynamics occurred when the group doubled in size on Saturday evening.  Seems that some youth had heard the lock-in was only for Saturday night.  Hmmmm.

<p>We had one more meeting planned, and wow. There was a pretty big rift between the two groups. I think it was overall handled poorly; not *all* the youth had to be at the meeting, and they certainly didn't want to be there. I have certainly learned from the experience.

<p>Then it was play wall ball, play loud music, and play movies night until 3 or 4 am.  I went to bed at about 1 and got major good sleep until I woke up at 6 from a weird dream set in Austin.

<p><blockquote><em>
We were at Austin First Church and I was wearing my Lyle Luau "Near .. Far" Grover shirt. We were in a long line to say HI to some famous DJ type guy wearing shades outside in the parking lot. He was near a fence. Somehow I was whisked forward in line; I didn't have to wait behind everyone, and he talked with me more than with anyone else. We play-danced some funny playfully overtly sexual dance move and I woke up.
</em></blockquote>

<p>I got up and surveyed the church to find everyone asleep, zonked out strewn across the floor basically in 3 rooms, mostly in the movie watching room.

<p>No one had cooked the cookie dough, so I made sure it hadn't gone bad. It hadn't, so I ate a bit more.

<p>The place was mostly clean, amazingly enough, so cleanup was not too difficult at 8am when I woke everyone up. I mostly coordinated the cleanup efforts and when it was all good, we had cereal and said our goodbyes.

<p>To church our group went by way of IHOP, where I noticed the picture of "IHOP" written in syrup on the front of the menu looks like "dOH!" upsided down. Pretty cool; try it.

<p>I was pretty doze-y during church then went home, shaved my head and slept.</p>

                        <p><title>Skated at Galveston</title></p>

<p class=date>13 October 1998</p>

<p>This morning I went to Galveston to skate.  

<p>"Galveston?" you may ask.  

<p>It's the city on the Gulf of Mexico 60 miles south of Houston on I-45.  It's where 3 lanes each direction of I-45 melts into asphalt surface road with lights at mile marker 0.  Galveston.

<p>So anyway, I drove there early this morning - like 8am and parked on Stuart Beach. I walked slowly around the beach and waded in the water, and even sat down in the shallow surf for a while, all while reading my new JavaScript book.  Ack.. can't get away from computers, even at the beach!!

<p>I enjoyed the sun and sea and birds and all and then I sat in the trunk of my car to read in the shade. I pored through seven chapters and found my brain was full.  

<p>Time to skate.

<p>Meticulously brushed my feet off before driving off the beach up to the sea wall, where I parked and put on my skates.

<p>There were very few people on the island (it's not actually an island, but it's close, so they call it that.) but I skated about 1/2 mile upwind and followed a driveway down toward the beach. I could see it led to an old parking lot of some sort, but I couldn't see exactly what.

<p>Over colorful graffiti I rolled, reading about who loves who for how long and who can bite what and who rules and who was where and all variety of stuff. Greenery squeezed out a living between the large slabs of concrete and an empty pay phone shell stood at the edge of the lot like a sentry.

<p>A rusted hand rail stood between the parking lot and another driveway that curved up toward the street again. Or did it?
I decided to follow the other driveway since it disappeared, curving into the tall weeds.

<p>More graffiti, this time a picture of a gun with a ridiculously large bullet leaving the chamber, and wait-a-minute! this driveway curves back around into a loop??  This was a go-cart track!!

<p>Mystery solved, I imagined what the facility must have been like when it was new.  Why did it go out of business?  How long ago?  Hmmmm.

<p>Back to the sea wall boulevard, and across to the other side, where the road surface slopes upward again, making a secondary sea wall.  Nothing to sea, er see, over the wall so I sped back down the slope and back across 5 empty lanes to the sea-side sidewalk.

<p>Wow. Now I was skating with the wind and it was soooo much easier!!  At the light for Ferry Street or Road or whatever, I turned right, toward the ferry. It was 1.25 miles away according to the signs, and I found it pleasing to skate past all the cars and trucks and a bus that were parked in line waiting for the ferry after they had all sped past me on the street.

<p>All the way up to the sign that read, "DO NOT CROSS THIS LINE UNTIL INSTRUCTED BY DECK HAND" I waited for the ferry to arrive.
I imagined a giant hand on the deck motioning for me to cross the line.

<p>By the time the ferry arrived, I was joined by some others intending to walk aboard.  The ferry docked and one of the Deck Hands walked past me and without stopping said, "you can't wear those on the ferry boat."

<p>I blinked.

<p>Hmmm. Do I want to go across the ferry, or do I want to skate?

<p>I want to skate.

<p>So I watched the whole process of loading and unloading of cars, intrigued by the nearly imperceptible listing of the ferry as the cars rolled off one side, then the other, then as new cars rolled on one side, then the other.

<p>But what was most impressive was the number of cars they packed on this thing.  The bus, a couple of 6 wheeler "cube" trucks, three short 18 wheelers, and a lot of cars. As they filled up the back of the ferry, I was all, "okay that's the last car." nope a van.. "okay, <em>that's</em> the last car." nope a couple more cars. Finally the last car squeezed on. An orange-ish red VW Bug.  Yeah.

<p>They closed the gates and began to pull away, and I skated past the ominous sign toward the churning waters behind the ferry.  The Deck Hands whistled to get my attention and waved me away. I smiled and waved back.  "Come get me!!!" I thought.

<p>Ah well..  

<p>Skated 1.25 miles back toward Stuart Beach and back to the 
sea-side side walk and again skated downwind for a while.

<p>Oh yes this is great!  I jumped up onto and down off of the concrete benches as I went past, swerved around sign posts, or between them if appropriate and had a great time. I watched some guys preparing rebar for a concrete driveway and even skated out onto a paved jetty on the end of which some people were fishing.

<p>The pavement was hardly smooth, so I abandoned the thought of going all the way to the end. In fact, I almost ate it once on the way back, as I skated pretty close to the edge and almost didn't make it jumping over a large gap in the rocks.

<p>But,  I did not wreck and made it safely back up the steps to the sidewalk.  Skate skate skate to another jetty, this one not paved, but just essentially cube shaped granite stones with a few inch gap between each one.

<p>Now <em>that</em> was a challenge to skate very quickly. Each instant I was stopped by a bump, rolling down a rut, stepping past something and jumping over the gaps all at once. Wow.

<p>Yes, I had my helmet on. Yes it was dangerous. No I did not fall. Yes I would do it again.

<p>A bit further down wind I skated and then realized, "wait-a-minute.. I'm going down wind!"

<p>I turned around and my car was out of sight. Not like, "hey baby, that car is <em>out of sight!</em>" but like really really far away.

<p>Oh yes.  I savored the delicious leg muscle burn as I tucked and pushed into the wind.  My lower back began to ache from maintaining the crouched position but I forged on.

<p>Okay, so I'm being a bit melodramatic, but the difference was quite significant. I had to act as my own cheerleader at the end to keep myself from stopping.

<p>Made it.

<p>Sweat literally poured out of my helmet when I took it off. Threw my sweaty helmet, skates, pads and socks into the trunk and headed home.

                        <p><title>Play I-Group</title></p>

<p class=date>10 October 1998</p>

<p>Okay, this entry is a teeeeny bit different from my others because I actually wrote it in an ICQ chat session with my friend Jen who lives somewhere in the arctic circle or something (Okay, New Hampshire) and I only mention that now because she replied in a portion of the text and it makes it so much funnier!

<pre>
I met my Play I-Group (non-competitive play men's group) today 
at the Hill at Miller Outdoor Theater.  "Hill" because it's the
only hill in Houston just about and definitely man - made.  I
brought a cooler of ice and two big things of Gatorade and grapes
and my frisbee.  I told the other men to bring balls or frisbees
or whatever they had for good outdoor play!

I was the first one there, and some youth were there with their
school and they motioned for my frisbee.  So I threw it to them
and they and I tossed it around a bit until David arrived and I
was talking to him and would without warning break the 
conversation to catch the frisbee when it came near me.

Then Dick arrived and he brought some stale-ish bread (for duck
feeding) and a football.  *Immediately* the youth were all, 
"hey!" and they ditched the frisbee in 2 seconds and within 5
minutes they had a football game set up.  I was glad because I
can barely throw a football at all, but I am great with a disc!
  
So Tony arrived and the four of us played frisbee on the side of
the hill with about 20 youth playing touch football..  probably
about 30 minutes we played and our game kinda dissolved at the
same time the youth were called in to "put your shirts back on!"
and board the busses.

Then I was all, "hey guess what?"   and I opened the cooler to
reveal my cell phone (that wasn't the "guess what," but it was
kinda funny that it responded less quickly when I pushed the
buttons.  but it did in fact work fine. )

What I really wanted to show them was the big block of ice I had
in the cooler.  about 9x9 inches and 5 inches thick, a nice big
clear block of ice.  

Now "where" you may ask, "did you get such a block of ice?"
Good question.
And "why" you may ask, "did I have such a block of ice out here?" 
JEN: I asked those in my head when I read it :)

I'm glad you asked.
If you've read a particular one of my 
<a href="/cgi-local/journal.pl?date=1998/07/09#hermann_park_ice1">previous journal entries</a>

JEN: About the sliding on blocks of ice??

:-) yes yes yes!!!! 
I still had the same block of ice!!

JEN: You STILL HAD IT????? 

yes!!!

JEN: Pardon me while I LAUGH MY ASS OFF!

I had been keeping it in my freezer just for this type of opportunity!!!  

JEN: Oh my....I can see where this is going!

downhill fast!
hahahhahahahaahahahahaaaa
So, yes.  I was like, "blah blah blah and we slid down the hill on the blocks of ice."  

"I'd like to see this" was their general response.
So I showed them.  It took a few tries to get the right what..
um.  the right parameters the right slipperiness?    but after a
few tries I slid almost all the way down the hill as far as I had
the first day I did it.  

So, "who's next?" I asked.  

Tony was all, "I don't want to get all wet"  

"Oh you won't get too wet if you use my frisbee"   so he sat on
my frisbee on the ice and I must say it didn't work too well.. 
since the frisbee was all slick the frisbee kept sliding off the
ice instead of the ice sliding down the hill.  but he got about 5
feet down..  

Then a girl walked by and they were all, "hey is that a camera?"
and paid her a couple bucks (like 3 dollars) and took about 2 or
3 shots of me sliding down the hill!  Maybe we'll see the pics
again and maybe not, but it sure was fun..  

My butt was soaked, but we had a great time and Tony and I
carried the cooler back to my car (and the ice is safely back in
my freezer again, though a bit smaller, and I can see a lot of
stress fractures developing in it..

Back to the hill we met Dick and David and walked over toward the
duck pond to feed the ducks.   I hadn't done that in a really
long time.. We were visited by about 100 pigeons who were all
very careful of the ducks' bills put everyone (we and the birds)
had a good time.  I even threw a piece to a squirrel who snuck
down a tree behind us to see if he could get a piece of bread
action.

I was impressed that the ducks could nab bread out of the air..
but I guess I've seen dogs do it.. but then again, the duck bill
is way smaller than the gaping maw of a dog..  good precision and
three of the ducks were consistently catching bread out of the
air.

Then we ran out of bread and walked back and hugged and left.
On the way back, I was driving and "CRUNCH" I heard a something
beside me and a car on the other side of the street wheel didn't
go flat, but was all dragging as the axel had broken and the
wheel well of the car was sitting on the tire.  Yipes!!

I did a quick U-turn and moved my car in behind her but durn if
she wasn't in both lanes..  I moved my car off the street and
called a wrecker (which took proverbially forever to get there)
and made sure she got towed before I went home.

<p class=date>9 October 1998</p>
<br>Updated 27 October 1998 with dry pictures

<p><a href="/cgi-local/journal.pl?date=1998/09/11#Houston_flooded_21">Here</a> is the original entry from when Houston flooded.

<p>Walking down Montrose toward the intersection with Allen Parkway, we saw <a href="/images/home/Houston/floods/1998_september/overview.jpg">this</a>.
<br>"Wow; it's flooded."
<br>Yes, but understand that Allen Parkway goes <em>under</em> that intersection.
<br><a href="/images/home/Houston/floods/1998_september/dryview.jpg">Here</a> is the normal version.

<p><a href="/images/home/Houston/floods/1998_september/red_reflection.jpg">This</a> was
taken from the middle of the intersection.  I like how the red light reflects on the water.
<br>Notice how the red light is nearly washed out by the sunlight <a href="/images/home/Houston/floods/1998_september/no_reflection.jpg">here</a>.

<p>Next we turned right along Allen Parkway and took a pic across the street.  <a href="/images/home/Houston/floods/1998_september/parked.jpg">This bus</a> was empty. 
<br>I didn't take a dry version of this shot.

<p>A bit further down Allen Parkway we looked back toward the <a href="/images/home/Houston/floods/1998_september/wet.jpg">intersection</a>.  In the pic I can barely see the guy in white and lady in blue right in front of the yellow truck.  The trucks did go across the street.
<br><a href="/images/home/Houston/floods/1998_september/dry.jpg">Here</a> is the dry version.

<p>Looking the other direction from the same location, the water was pouring over the <a href="/images/home/Houston/floods/1998_september/over_rail.jpg">guard rail</a>.   In the top right corner of that picture can be seen the reflection of this <a href="/images/home/Houston/floods/1998_september/tressel.jpg">railroad tressel</a> that crosses Allen Parkway.
<br><a href="/images/home/Houston/floods/1998_september/dry_tressel.jpg">The tressel</a> again.

<p>Here is the <a href="/images/home/Houston/floods/1998_september/flood_gauge.jpg">flood gauge</a> that made us laugh so hard.  It is somewhat past the railroad tressel.
<br><a href="/images/home/Houston/floods/1998_september/dry_gauge.jpg">Not flooded</a> version.

<p>And here are pics of <a href="/images/home/Houston/floods/1998_september/eric_no_park.jpg">Eric</a> and <a href="/images/home/Houston/floods/1998_september/rob_no_park.jpg">me</a> under the tressel. 
No parking here!!
<br>Still <a href="/images/home/Houston/floods/1998_september/still_no_parking.jpg">no parking</a>.

<p>Walking back toward Montrose, we saw this <a
href="/images/home/Houston/floods/1998_september/u_st_thomas.jpg">helpful sign</a>.

<p><p>I got this in with my phone bill today:</p>

<pre>
Customers with 713 & 281 area codes need to dial 10 digits:  New area code coming.

Beginning January 16, 1999, you will need to dial the area code
plus the seven digit phone number to make a local call in the
Houston calling area.  If you do not dial the area code before
the seven-digit phone number, you will reach a recording asking
you to do so.  You will not need to dial "1" or "0" before the
10-digit number on local calls.  Your 10-digit phone number will
not change, and you can start dialing 10-digits now for local calls.

In addition a third area code, "832," will be available on
January 16, 1999 along with the 713 and 281 area codes for
customers requesting new telephone numbers, regardless of where
their homes or businesses are geographically located in the
Houston area.

Ten-digit dialing is part of the area code relief plan being
implemented by telecommunications companies in Texas.  Area code
relief is needed because of the escalating demand for additional
telephone numbers for cellular phones, pagers, computers, fax
machines and other communications equipment in the Houston area.
</pre>

<p><p>I tried to scan it with OCR software and got this:</p>

<p class=date>2 October 1998</p>

<p>I'm right now listening to nine inch nails' "the downward spiral" on _downward spiral_  CD.

<p>As soon as the CD ends I'm leaving to go check out a haunted house with the youth group!  There are 3 houses super close to each other near downtown on Fannin Street.  Haunted Hotel, Haunted Hotel 2, and Fear Factory.

<p>Earlier today I cruised out there to see where to park and stuff before they get all crowded.  I talked to the owner dude (owns all three) and he gave me a teeny bit of inside info - how many of what different types of animated monsters they have in which hotels and that kind of stuff. 

<p>He suggested that we start at _Fear Factory_ and we'll get discount passes to the other two.

<p>I assured him that not all of the group would want to go to all the houses, but I appreciated his offer!

<p><hr width="50%" align="left">

<p>When I worked at Telecheck, I wrote a program that calculated the number of days between any two dates.  I used it to determine how many days old I was, and determined that I turned 10000 days old on 10 August 1997.  

<p>But I quit Telecheck and had no access to the program.

<p>So my dad wrote a version for Windows!  I'll put it on here so you can download it soon.

<p>CD is over; I'm outta here!

<p class=date>30 September 1998</p>

<p>Things are going pretty great lately.

<p>Just last night, after 2 weeks of using my display at 640x480 pixels and 16 colors, Thomas was able to come over and fix it. I needed a PCIIX driver and a S3 Virge/DX driver and I just didn't have the expertise to get everything set.  But now it's 1024x768 and 24 bit color and it's great!!!

<p>I'm actually pleased with Windows right about now.

<p>I was able to easily scan pictures and maps and get some cash flow via <a href="https://www.mrlaboratories.com">MR Laboratories</a>

<p>I don't know if I mentioned, but I opened a business account and my first check was to Office Max to purchase office supplies: pens, paper, envelopes, a ZIP disk rack, and file folders.
<br>My second check was to Carroll's used office furniture for a 3 drawer vertical filing cabinet.  Yay!

<p>I have moved my computer into my living room; it had been in my bedroom, and I love it.  Oh!  and that's a story in itself:

<p>I wanted to move my computer, but the phone line for the modem only reached to my bedroom. It hadn't been strung to the living room.  So I recognized I needed some phone wire and within 5 minutes, I heard the unmistakable warble of a telephone repair guy downstairs testing phone lines.

<p>Holy cow!  So I ran downstairs and described my delimma. He said he couldn't wire it for me, but he could give me 40 feet of phone line!  Fabulous!  So that night I connected the line to the jack in my bedroom, strung it outside between the bedroom and living room windows, and connected it to a jack in the living room.  Really.

<p>And it works perfectly!  I'm using it ri

                        <p class=date>26 September 1998</p>

<p><p>Today I was frustrated (again) at my computer so I decided to go to Astroworld.  I have a season pass and I&rsquo;ve hardly used it; I think this is my 3rd time to go this season.  (Strictly speaking I&rsquo;ve gotten my money&rsquo;s worth out of it, but only 3 times??)</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m pretty much tired as heck, so I&rsquo;ll keep this short.</p>

<p><p>I got there around 4pm and paid my 5 bucks to park.</p>

<p><p>Before the park closed at 8pm, I rode Greased Lightning 9 times, Dungeon Drop 4 times, The Viper 2 times, Taz&rsquo;s Texas Tornado 2 times, Texas Cyclone 2 times and maybe Excalibur 1 time.</p>

<p><p>After the park closed at 8pm, the following rides remained open for a private party:  Viper, Excalibur, Mayan Mindbender, Dungeon Drop.  In 2 hours, I rode  Viper 3 times, Dungeon Drop 4 times, Excalibur 8 times, and Mayan Mindbender 7 times.</p>

<blockquote><p>
Mayan Mindbender is a small indoor coaster with no lights on the coaster.  The cars on the train are designed to each seat up to 2 people in a single file manner.  

<p>I sat in the last seat.  The first time, I found that I could get my left leg on the other side of the bar to where my right leg should be.  I rode the ride looking backwards.

<p>The second time, I completely switched my feet and faced my entire body backwards, with my knees down where my feet should go.. I was like kneeling backwards in the car.

<p>Another time I rode, I faced forward, but while sitting on top of the lap bar instead of under it.  I gripped the hand bar in front of me as if riding a motorcycle.

<p>A few times, at the very end of the ride, while the train was moving slowly back into the light, my car was still in the darkened section of the track, and I stood entirely up in my car.

<p>Each time, I was able to get seated correctly again and act like Mr Innocent.

</blockquote>

<p><p>Oh, when I rode Excalibur, I was able to grab leaves and grass from the trees and ground, and I started collecting them in a pile in the &ldquo;garage&rdquo; of the coaster.  That is something I did as a youth at Astroworld 10-14 years ago.</p>

<p><p>Today was really a day for me to play and play.</p>

<p><p>So anyway, it was a private party and I didn&rsquo;t get kicked out because I happened to be wearing a wristband from YMCA Camp Cullen, which I&rsquo;ve had on for like 6 weeks now.  It looked vaguely similar to the wristband that each person in this private party had to wear that I got 2 hours of exclusive ride time.</p>

<p><p>Yeee!!!</p>

<p><p></p>
