<p>Mikey and Joel cooked lunch for us today.  Quite funny to watch
them tossing veggie burgers onto sizzling hot oil and jumping back so
as to not be burned by the hot splashing oil.  They were all laughing
and having a great time.  So awesome to have such positive energy put
into our lunch.</p>

<p>Nice Laura Douglas came over; it was great to see her again.</p>

<p>Wow.  I'm totally falling asleep as I write this entry.  I don't
know why I'm so tired.</p>

<p>Tyler walked toward the kitchen, carrying a cup of hot tea.  Joel
grabbed his arm and yanked it back, causing the tea to spill all over
Joel's hip and shirt and such.</p>

<p>"Ahhh!!!  it burns!" through laughter as they both cracked up at
the situation.</p>

<p>The story, relayed to those who came to see what happened quickly
transformed into, "I was trying to get by Tyler so I said 'excuse me'
and he whirled around and threw scalding tea on me!"</p>

<p>So funny.</p>

<p>I'm going to read Stephen King's _The Gunslinger_ to Janette.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Hahahah!!</p>

<p>Cracking up laughing as I read with my mouthguard in, which makes
my speech sound like Drew Barrymore.  (I fancy it does cause that
makes me think of her and I'm hard pressed to think of a time that I
don't want to be thinking of Drew Barrymore)</p>

<p>"The Gunthlinger"</p>

<p>HAHAHAHAHAHAAHAH!!!!</p>

<p>Over and over until she was finally all, "okay, don't read the
title anymore."</p>

<p>"Okay."</p>

<p>snickersnort</p>

<p>HAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHA!!!</p>

<p>"okay."</p>

<p>"okay."</p>

<p>"The man in black thled acloss the dethert." ahaAhahahaHAHAHAAAaa!!!!</p>

<p>AHHAHAHAAHAa</p>

<p>"okay." sigh.  "okay."</p>

<p>AHAHHAHAAHAHAHAH</p>

<p>"This is how movies waste so much film."</p>

<p>"okay."</p>

<p>"The man in black HAHAHahahahhaahahaahahhaah!!!"</p>

<p>This happened maybe 10 times; It took so long to get to the second
phrase of the first sentence of the book.</p>

<p>"The man in black thled acloss the dethert, and the gunthlinger
thollowed. HAHahaahahahahaahahahaahah!!!!!"</p>

<p>I took my mouthguard out and read.</p>

<p>I've been asleep for a while and woke up when the kittens' loud
game of Apples to Apples broke up.  I took an Eminem Quiz (did rather
poorly I think) and got about 5 of 15 right.</p>

<p>Oh, and I emailed Micaela back and my email bounced because someone
on my mail server has been sending spam to AOL users so our server has
been banned from AOL.  Pooey.  I wrote to my sysadmin to get the shit
fixed.</p>

<p>Read LJs and found it interesting that Ryan has determined that we
live in order to experience our feelings for a completely different
reason than I have determined the same thing.</p>

<p>I've written my reason before, but I'm too tired to look for it
now.</p>

<p>Went to CD Source, which I must admit has a great selection.  Lots
of variety.  Lots of bands I'd never heard of.  I asked for some
jungle, but none of them knew of any artists that would be good for
that kind of thing.  The jungle expert was gone for the day.</p>

<p>I found Tori Amos stack and bought a single for $1.99 that includes
a live version of "Winter."  Listened to Amelia's CD on the way home
and ended up stopping at the bookstore.  I was joking at first but
they were really set on going once the idea had formulated.</p>

<p>I looked for <em>Angry Blonde</em> the Eminem story, which the
computers thought they had in stock twice.  But I couldn't find it,
and the sales person couldn't either.  Ah well.  I did find a Nine
Inch Nails biography and Marilyn Manson biography, but didn't get
either of them.  Had forgotten my wallet.</p>

<p>(oh, thanks to Janette and Josephine for spotting me $1.99 + tax at
the CD store, but then I found $2.25 in my pockets at the bookstore to
repay them)</p>

<p>Informal gathering for breakfast; everyone is not even awake yet.
But Tanner, Ryan, Matt, Skyler, Celeste, Josephine, Jack, Heather, and
a quiet sleepy Hillary in the chair all collected around the table for
quiche: 2 with spinach, onions, cheese, and 1 of just bacon.  Funny is
that when she poured eggs into the pie things, there wasn't enough
liquid to cover them up.  We laughed.  True to Janette's low stress
nature, "we'll just see what happens."</p>

<p>Funny = Matt's Chef Cookie Jar, with French accent, "HauHAAuu!!
Keep yor hands aWAY from the cookie jah!"</p>

<p>Left the bookstore; went to Blockbuster, but they were closed.
However, some of Josephine's friends from high school drove up and
Joey was talking to them.  Tanner and/or Joel plus Mikey had some sort
of inside joke about whizzing in the radiator.  Mikey went up to see
if he could get them to open their hood, but Jo was coming back just
as he walked up.</p>

<p>So we drove, inadvertantly ended up behind them at a traffic
light.  He tried again, but the light turned green just as he got
out.</p>

<p>This happened <em>again</em> at a different light (nothing
inadvertant this time, just convenient cause we were going the same
direction), and this time they waited just long enough for him to say
something, which turned out to be "uh, have a nice ride."</p>

<p>Laughed the rest of the way home.</p>

<p>Janette and i rode bikes around the cool part of the lake, down by
the spillway.  It was still spilling basically all the way across, but
not nearly the volume.  More like 1 inch with 3 inch waves sliding
across like a horizontal barber pole creating diagonal splashes
walking down the wall.</p>

<p>We rode through where the chain link fence had been knocked down,
carried our bikes across some rocks to the island on the downside of
the concrete spillway.</p>

<p>I think I could see on an adjacent island how high the water had
been; about three feet above the current water level, leaves were
covering the ground, as if they had fallen there from trees naturally,
not like they had been dropped off there by receding water.  The lower
parts of the island were basically clean except for a very few same
type of leaves.</p>

<p>Josephine went to take a shower and Heather needed to get something
for whatever reason.</p>

<p>Heather was all, "Josephine?  Are you in the shower?"</p>

<p>"Yes!" Jo hollered through the door.</p>

<p>"Can I come in for a second?"</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>Five seconds after she went in a closed the door, I went up to it,
"Heather?  Are you in the shower?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"Can I come in?"   "just kidding."</p>

<p>Then Mikey and I both went up to the door while Heather and
Josephine were still in there.  Mikey goes, "Rob?  Are you in the
shower?"</p>

<p>me: "Yeah!"  them: "No!"</p>

<p>"Can I come in?"</p>

<p>me: "Sure!"  them: WTF??</p>

<p>us: Hahahahhaahaahaahah! and walked away.</p>

<p>Allison, Sean's ex girlfriend happened to be at the house when we
all made it back.  She seems like quite an outgoing person, living
fully happily in New York (Janette says she (Allison) saw the WTC get
fucked up in 2001), going to school at some artsy school.</p>

<p>This summer she'll visit her brother in the Ukraine, and get to do
something (go to Lucca) in Italy and then work in Italy as a
photographer for her friend.</p>

<p>I didn't really talk to her as she was hanging out, but she left to
see her boyfriend (a performer in the band Polyphonic Spree (is that
the one that someone and someone else drove like a really long way
just to see?  I don't remember, but it sounds close (I don't think it
is)) which is apparently performing tonight) I was all, "you have good
energy," and "I'm glad you're going to do cool things this
summer."</p>
