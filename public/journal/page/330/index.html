<p>I feel sad.</p>

<p>Stephanie is leaving Japan on Thursday.  My first
new-teacher-friend that I could hang out with comfortably and show her
how to buck the Nova system and joke about stupid stuff and walk
around and whatever.  Gone in less than a month.  We only hung out
like.. 3 times I think.  First I told her diplomatically, "fuck what
Scott says; your lesson was almost certainly fine; whatever you did
was fine."  Then we met at Subway when we had the same lunch.  Then we
zoomed down to Yokohama and munched at TGI Fridays and caught some of
the last trains home.  Then we went walking around Kawasaki and I
showed her Cinecitta area and we didn't eat at Tuk Tuk Thai food, but
we did yammer around the CD shop.  Most recent adventure was getting
Ocean's Eleven and watching that over Kraft macaroni after I soundly
beat her at Uno and then she barely beat me back.  We decided we'd go
to OZ together this winter break.  She felt a bit sick that night and
I told her not to die.  She didn't die, and I'm super thankful for
that.  But she didn't come in to work the next day.  Nor the next day.
Nor during her weekend as we bounced a few text messages that she was
feeling like crapola and the hospital couldn't figure anything
out.</p>

<p>Most recent message asked me to take her to the airport on
Thursday.  Sigh.  I'd be honored.</p>

<p>Sometimes I write least when there's the most to write.</p>

<p>Frank's going away party. I was impressed with the huge impact he
has had on the students.  Maybe it's just that one student owns a
restaurant.  But we got the party room in that restaurant.  Amazing
meal.   Not like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom amazing, but
tons of sushi and pineapple and tempura and miso soup.  Fucking
sweet.  And karaoke.  And I got to speak a lot of Japanese with some
of the peeps there.  Yasuko, Yasuko, Atsuko, Saiyuri, Yoriko, Jun and
Daisuke, the owner.</p>

<p>Recorded a lot.  Got some sweet funny conversations.  May
transcribe them sometime this century.</p>

<p>I was envious of the impact Frank seemed to have.  I want that kind
of impact.  My going away party at Houston Rally proved my
impactfullness.  I'm falling asleep.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Went home and then went to the river and recorded a lot more.
Steve and Matty left early, leaving me, Frank, Peter, Chris ("Kiwi")
to yammer.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Definitely falling asleep.</p>

<p>Today I got a text message from Stephanie, who didn't come to work
last night.  She's in the hospital.  Yikes stripes!  I don't know what
the deal is with that, but I have just texted her for more details.  I
hope she's okay.</p>

<p>Nothing amazingly good today, but one amazingly fucked up thing
that I was asked to do: <em>count</em> the number of various types of
students that were on our schedule.  This is part of the Daily
Statistics Report, done every day.  Mate, we *count*, by hand, the
number of students (man to man 7C students; man to man kids students;
business students; toefl students; eiken students), from a piece of
paper that was printed by a computer!  How fucked up is that?</p>

<p>Stephanie wrote back, "I AM SCARED AND WEIRDED OUT"</p>

<p>I haven't ready *anyone's* livejournal in a long time.   I feel
sad/guilty/? for letting that go.  That equals YRUU-connection.  Even
with my favorites.  I don't have the time to read them all, and I feel
afraid to miss something, or not "be there" for someone.</p>

<p>Maybe I won't say, "I'll always be there for you," but instead,
"I'll be here for you" or even, "I'll be here," but then I might move:
"I'll do my own thing wherever I am."</p>

<p>Watched _Oceans Eleven_ with Stephanie at her crib.  Pretty good
movie.  I don't understand why the goons from the casino are still
following him at the end of the movie.  Okay I know why they're
following him, but why did the movie <em>end</em> before that was
resolved?</p>

<p>sigh.</p>

<p>Enjoyed chillin' with Steph, but her city smells like rotten.
(Thanks, Ralph Wiggum)</p>

<p>Well, I found the *best* place to hand out tissues: at the top of
the elevator at Kawasaki station.  Mofos were just lining up to grab a
pack of tissues.  Okay, they were lining up to use the escalator, but
50% grabbed a tissue as they passed me.  Only problem is that I'm not
allowed to hand them out there.  Almost finished the entire bag before
I was asked to leave by a cop.</p>

<p>Moo.</p>

<p>Heard from Olivia that Amy, Jen and Olivia's nightmare flatmate
left a hellacious mess in the flat.  Left her room a disaster, her
section of the kitchen a disaster, etc. etc.  Disasters

<p>Today I didn't meet with Ayana; she has had to work toooo much.
She's been home 3 days this week.</p>

<p>Wrote email and read (and filled out) janette's test letter.   Will
send it back before she comes here probably.</p>

<p>Walked around with Stephanie after work.   Showed her Cinecitta and
that area; Tuk Tuk Thai food piqued her interest; she loves Thai.
Wandered around the CD store in Cinecitta complex and then up and down
the little night life streets.   I wasn't offered a massagie by any of
the women on the street, presumably cause I was with her.</p>

<p>Went to the arcade where we had the air hockey championship and
were just about to play a game when she felt woozie.  She's diabetic
and checked her blood sugar (insulin?). It was at 37 ("that's bad"),
so she ate a snack and we left.  She was a bit shakey and later said
that was the lowest she's been in Japan.  D'oh.</p>

<p>We're going to hang out and watch a movie tomorrow night.  I dunno
which one.</p>

<p>Exchanged a pile of text messages with Rieko today.  I don't know
what her first message tried to say, and the subsequent ones were
therefore confusing for both parties, but she told me "don't afraid to
write Japanese," which I appreciate.  Nice to have such support.</p>

<p>Early shift came too early today for my brain, but I got up anyway
and made it to Kamata 15 minutes before the bell.  Didn't shave today;
3 days of stubble goin' on, with the argument that for all the
students know, I keep it this way.  We're asked not to grow beards
while we're not on vacation.</p>

<p>My first student was (is) a no show.  Rock.  Nice way to start off
the day.</p>

<p class=date>10:54am</p>

<p>Second student cancelled.  Money. (*)</p>

<p class=date>5:26pm</p>

<p>Second to last lesson was two level 3 women.  I told them about my
idea of bringing the warrior training to Japan; maybe this thing can
happen where we help get a real dialogue going here instead of blindly
crashing the country into the cliffs.  Gave them my email address.
Keiko and Youko.  Talked about names at first and then shifted to talk
about me and then to my dream.</p>

<p>Youko seemed most impressed when I used the words "maintain
personal integrity" and "take ownership of my own actions."</p>

<p>Last student is a no show.  I'm so lucky.  :-)</p>

<p>(*) I didn't like the movie from which I imagine Frank got this
phrase.  I don't really like the idea of emulating Frank, either, but
he says it so much that it's kinda stuck.</p>
