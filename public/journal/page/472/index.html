<p>Noah found a cool game they set up for us outside.</p>

<p>They set up these posts (like what Noah and Ryan are standing on,
trying to exchange places) all in a line along the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Noah had done this once or twice already: we hopped/stepped from
post to post all the way from the building, around a 90 degree turn,
past a tree (had to grab onto its branch to make it across) and down
to the restrooms, where we jumped up onto the fence around the
restroom doors.  I was standing on top as Noah was climbing up.</p>

<p>"Noah and Rob!"</p>

<p>"Are we in trouble?" I asked Noah.</p>

<p>"Bryn is pissed."</p>

<p>"Aw man."</p>

<p>"Think about the liability issues and what an influence you have on
others here," she pointed out.</p>

<p>I love Bryn for being willing to speak out against dumb behavior.</p>

<p>We chose not to climb over the roof of the bathroom (trivial enough
for any of the other youth to do, and high profile enough to make them
want to do it if we do) and walked over to the other fence, climbed it
as if we had climbed over the roof.  Jumped from the fence to the tree
and down to the next line of posts in the ground.  I went down toward
the women's restroom door and turned around (that was the end) and
came back.  Noah was on the posts so I jumped to the tree to let him
get past me.  Then I continued and barely made it across another wide
gap.  Chairs were set up so we could get to and from four posts in the
middle of a little grass yard area.</p>

<p>To the next (and last) end of the post line and then we took about
five attempts to pull off the switch places move.  We did it by
linking elbows and with a bit of arm flailing to balance, but we did
it.  Excellent.</p>

<p>Dance now.</p>

<p class=date>12:07am Tuesday 23 July 2002</p>

<p>Dance was great though not a lot of fast songs were played.  We
still danced plenty and mostly everyone was drenched with sweat, and
not just from dancing; it's hot!</p>

<p>Played a couple Eminem songs, but neither of them finished because
the CD player didn't seem to stay consistent through any entire song.
It's all good though.</p>

<p>After dance was touch group meetings, but before that Erin
expressed some of her sadness to me that came up during the prison
reform workshop, during part of which I slept.</p>

<p>In touch group we played Green Glass Doors (what can you take
through them?  (the same things that you can Take to The Moon)) and
everyone got it after a while except for Hunter I think.  But it's all
good as well.</p>

<p>Um, then worship was cool with improv vocal/body music including
beat boxing and elements from our human instruments (from touch group)
and the techno song that David and I have performed.  Good stuff.</p>

<p>Instead of a hug exchange circle, we did something like the
unconditional honoring love gaze into one another's eyes for 10 or 15
seconds each.  Good stuff.</p>

<p>Then beautiful was the Lean On Me performed by four voices (Abbey
T, Laura C, Steve F, Richard W) and then by the group.</p>

<p>Silent Football now-ish.</p>

<p>Oh, this is an <em>excellent</em> game.  Describe the Picture,
basically played as telephone, with people being brought into the room
one at a time.  Audience gets to watch the whole thing.</p>

<p>"Person standing on a staircase, wearing red shirt and black gloves
and strikingly white shoes. He is smiling and has one hand in the air."</p>

<p>(That's what I remember)</p>

<p>There's a picture of a person wearing black and red cloth</p>

<p>This is a pcitreu of a person in a stariw.  the person is weaering
a red shiert black gloves s..  I couldn't keep up with her reading it
again.</p>

<p>So amazing.  Everyone raised their hands wanting to volunteer for
the second round.</p>

<p>In this picture I see a person standing arms crossed and smiling.
The person is wearing tan coveralls with an orange T-shirt under the
person is wearing thick dirty working gloves and large wrench.  He's
wearing a denim baseball hat airplane behind the person. The sun is
setting and the sky is gold red and blue.</p>

<p>Amelia did a great job of relaying the words.</p>

<p>There's a man standing with his arms crosed and he's holding a
wrench and tan overalls and a shirt that may or may not be blue and
in the back ground is an orange and gold sunset.</p>

<p>I see two people in an office one perons is stanidn up loking over
the fpist persons shoudler looking a ta alpatr</p>

<p>I couldn't keep up with her reading it at all.</p>

<p>Amber did a great job of relaying it.</p>

<p>During Abbey's Theme Speakin', I got Joel's attention, indicating
for him to throw me some chocolate.  My hands were sorta out on my
knee, cupped... he threw a perfect arc; I barely moved them an inch
and caught it.  Oh so subtle...  ;-)  Steve laughed silently at our
amazing smoothness.</p>

<p>Lake Games now!</p>

<p class=date>5:32pm Monday 22 July 2002</p>

<p>Lake Games were fun.  Noah and I nearly won the chicken fight
against Mattboy and Mikey.  But we lost.</p>

<p>There are people in the freezer right now.</p>

<p>Chicken fights were fun, though Abbey doesn't quite understand the
fun.  Noah and I assured her they were quite safe and tame and such.
Just then Asha hurt her back a bit, bending backwards.</p>

<p>Okay, they're relatively safe.</p>

<p>A chauffered Asha on her rickshaw-ish floatie, and she pulled me a
bit, but mostly not able to touch the bottom of the lake.</p>

<p>We almost instantly lost the two huge beach balls, but a boat
recovered them for us.  Then we lost one of them again about an hour
later.</p>

<p>Just before the end of the lake adventure, I told Sean and Abbey
"we have to get out of the lake soon, so I'm going up now to get first
dibs on shower."  Just then, Wende and Susie were walking down the
dock to becon people out.</p>

<p>In shower we sang "The ants go marching" and "Paul Revere" and
started "(You gotta) Fight For Your Right (to Party)", but didn't get
too far.</p>

<p>Last night Wende arrived; it was close to dark when I first saw
her.  We went toward worship together.  I imagined that she would feel
jealous that I was holding Bryn's hand, so I held Wende's hand as we
entered the worship space.</p>

<p>I'm glad Wende was able to attend SWUUSI; it looks like this will
be her last YRUU event in Southwest District for a while.</p>

<p>Crunch went the fire pit.  Tina yelled "YOU RAN OVER THE FIRE!!"
Then when he backed up trying to look at the damage done up front, he
bumped into a tree.</p>

<p>Oh no!!!!  Sean just went "Bwwababqbwbwaaaaa!!!"</p>

<p>First advisor meeting after cream cheese and peanut butter bagel.
Tanner was all, "that sounds gross.  but it's cool that you're eating
it."  :-)  Funny.</p>

<p>Joe and Amber slept in an air conditioned car last night.</p>

<p>Advisor meeting with Debu in charge was good but a bit long for me.
Now after two bowls of cereal and soy milk, I'm down with advisors and
youth leaders for the Power Shuffle Pre-history and stuff.</p>

<p>Amy Leyenberger just gave an <em>EXCELLENT</em> answer to "What is
the purpose of Power Shuffle?"</p>

<p>My favorite part of the planned Power Shuffle is that when people
process after the Power Shuffle, they get to choose their groups:
process with people they know and love best.</p>

<p>Took several tries to get my cell phone message to say without
static "Hi this is Rob, and the apartment has been rented and I'll be
out of town until the 28th. Bye."</p>

<p>Little bit of booty dancing and gave Bryn the Spam-ku book, gave
Tanner the Hello Nasty Beastie Boys poster.  Will give to Rick my
tiled chalice. I remembered Kat Checkley's name, introduced her
around.</p>

<p>Hethre has scheduled a Silent Football Rules workshop so the rule
description during the game can be faster.</p>

<p>We've just had opening circle, which started earlier than
scheduled.  Now Richard West is leading the first-timers' meeting and
I'm chillin' against the wall here outside.</p>

<p>During opening circle Amy got on Noah's back and I squatted in
front of Noah, who climbed onto my back.  It was a bit difficult to
stand, but we did for a while, until Noah leaned forward to hug me and
I lost my balance and we tumbled forward.  Doh!  I didn't mean to
cause that much disruption during opening circle, but that's the way
it was.</p>

<p class=date>5:35pm</p>

<p>I'm chillin' out by the lake; five youth are interested in
swimming, but may not until another advisor arrives.  Scott inquires
about boundaries (as he should), "can we get our feet wet?"  "can we
swim over there and bug those people?"</p>

<p>"Haha; no." I said, "you can get your feet wet, but no shorts wet."</p>

<p>"Do these count as shorts?"  "Can we take our shorts off?"</p>

<p>"No knees can get wet."</p>

<p class=date>5:45pm</p>

<p>Natalie and Lawren are squirting one another with water bottles
(near my laptop no less) "Rob are you recording this?"  "I am
now."</p>

<p>Classic YRUU story has just occurred: Debbie requested help getting
stuff out of the back of her Suburban.  The door handle is broken on
the back, so she climbed in the side door and onto the stuff in the
back in an attempt to open the back doors from the inside.</p>

<p>She got stuck.</p>

<p>I hollered at everyone, "hey come look at Debbie stuck in the back
of her truck!"</p>

<p>Debbie hollering "help!  heeelllllp!!" inside in a way that pleads
"how goofy of a situation did I get into this time?"</p>

<p>Pretty goofy.</p>

<p>But everyone came to look (several people, thanks to me) and.. when
Joe came and successfully opened the door from the outside, many
people were there to carry all the stuff.  Excellent!</p>
