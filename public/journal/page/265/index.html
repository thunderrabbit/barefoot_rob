<p>We&rsquo;ll be moving soon, though haven&rsquo;t yet confirmed our new place.  Hopefully it will be near The Pink Cow in Roppongi, so I&rsquo;ll be able to hang out there a bit more easily.</p>

<p>In other news, I&rsquo;m getting the reporting engine a bit more completed.</p>

<p>This is a view from inside the hole I&rsquo;m digging as part of a Minecraft art project I&rsquo;ve got in mind.  I plan to put a stop-action animation of the hole being dug on youtube.  Earlier, while researching stuff for work, I found <a href="https://www.bigdinosaur.org/">bigdinosaur.org</a>, on which a blog entry was posted about something work related.  mySQL or Javascript or some such.  Anyway, in the side bar he mentioned he liked Minecraft.  Hmm!  I also kinda want to have my server available on the world wide interwebs, but I don&rsquo;t really wanna pay a monthly fee to do it.  Maybe a group of us could all pitch in.  hmm.</p>

<p>So sad that it&rsquo;s all closed source, but I just pushed the first version of the reporting system to our client&rsquo;s admin site.  It uses backbone to do most of its goodness, including: add fields for filtering, add fields for output, run the report, and copy the report for more reporting fun!</p>

<p>Though Google should return results based on the browser&rsquo;s language instead of IP address, they&rsquo;ve gotten one step closer by making it easy to find the way to switch to the preferred language.</p>

<p>I can only hope that English was offered as the other option because my browser requested English, not some ham-fisted hard coding.</p>

<p>Kris was a repeat GET teacher on PB49th voyage; we hung out in Le Havre, France with Francois, Dave, and Kuni, enjoying wine and cheese and lovely architecture.   She just Skyped me out of the blue this morning (and by this morning, I mean 4pm Monday night, due to time zone differences), and by she skyped me, I mean her nearly-2-year-old daughter Skyped me!</p>

<p>We chatted a bit; her friend Luke from 47 is in town from OZ for a week.  Nice to reconnect with old friends.  :-)</p>

<p><em>The Joker tossed the head of her husband through the window.  She looked in horror as it spoke to her, like, &ldquo;surprise!!&rdquo; and I saw attached a canister with poison gas spewing out;  she got covered in gas and her head popped off and her face sunk into a spherical glass shell the size of her skull and rolled back toward The Joker; her head had become a bomb for his next target.  I escaped the gas by flying out of the room at great speed and relatively good flying control.  </em></p>

<p><em>Searching for Batman, I found him flying over the city, and caught up to him by flying a great arc past his position, and said his name quietly as I went by.  He turned to follow me, and we landed together along with Batgirl and all got into an extremely thin elevator.   Standing side by side with our backs against the wall, we had to hold the rickety door closed for there to be enough space as it squeezed up through the walls into a warehouse in which Batman had his latest car.</em></p>

<p><em>He explained that this car couldn&rsquo;t fly, but that it could crash through anything and remain unscathed, which he proved by driving through a display of bananas on some boxes set up in the warehouse by his crew.   He told me I needed to drive, so I hopped into the car (a convertible) and drove into the super market where The Joker was planning to attack next.   I learned to steer and control the acceleration with the yoke in front of me, as I weaved in and out of crowds in the super market.  In desperation to not squish a shopper, I found I <em>could</em> make the car fly a bit as I jumped over her like a BMX bunny hop, but with the latest Batmobile.</em></p>

<p><em>I made a few circuits of the store and then I saw some nefarious looking fellows doing nefarious looking activity in their black leather jackets and knew they had to be the bad guys, especially as one tried to hook the car and tie it to an industrial sized shelf.</em></p>

<p><em>I escaped the hook with some tricky maneuvers, and started to try stomping them with the car, but wasn&rsquo;t quite successful as I didn&rsquo;t have good enough control (due to dream inertia) and didn&rsquo;t catch them before I woke up.</em></p>

<p><em>In a large group of people in different buildings, I was flirting with a cute girl who looked liked she may be from India or Sri Lanka.   She had two friends, one of whom looked distinctly American, and I was flirting with <em>her</em> more.  The first girl noticed and blew me off in stride, and the second girl said to her girlfriend &ldquo;I think he likes me&rdquo; as she went out somewhere. </em></p>

<p>_I looked out the window as people started to gasp and point.  It looked like Niburu had arrived, though was moving rather slowly and perhaps narrowly missed the earth as it looked like it descended beyond the horizon.  I saw it hit the earth in a slow inexorable crash and it looked like one of the suns from a physics simulation I have on my phone.  It hit the planet on the other side of the horizon from my point of view, and there was a woman sitting on the chair looking a bit forlorn at the upcoming end of the world, and I said, &ldquo;stand up&rdquo; to her, but she didn&rsquo;t move, kinda of like, &ldquo;why should I stand up if the world is ending soon&rdquo; mixed with &ldquo;who are you to take my seat?&rdquo;  I yelled at her again until it was like &ldquo;Stand UP and Look out the WINDOW!&rdquo; as the object hit Earth (it was moving relatively slowly)  and the plume of smoke became visible from over the horizon and then the outward bound debris cloud creating more debris as everything collapsed in its path. _</p>

<p><em>People were screaming in the building and running like 右往左往 having no idea what to do.  I sat down on the floor and watched, keeping my back straight and eyes open, ready for the ride.</em></p>

<p><em>The smoke cloud came closer and went out of sight as it went under our building, and I could feel our building moving, perhaps lifting, then spinning a bit.  It felt good to enjoy the last few moments of life in such a tangible way.  Then it was all over.</em></p>

<p>the dream, that is haha</p>

<p><em>In a camp area, getting to hang out with Carla after talking to some guys while up on stage prepping for an event, I told her how much I admired her ability to be genki with people and how I want to enjoying hanging out with peeps as much as she does.  Something like how I need to just not worry about what other people think and just do whatever I want to do.  Or maybe just be able to chill with people and not worry about stuff.</em></p>

<p><em>We walked over to the housing area and I asked which bunk was hers.  She indicated the second floor of a building across the street from my building.  I had a space on the ground floor.  We didn&rsquo;t actually go to each other&rsquo;s areas, but just wanted to make sure we knew in case there was some reason to in the future.</em></p>

<p><em>I told her about the dream I had where we were both on PB again, and the waves were really rocking the boat, but we were still having fun and talking to the crew in the lounge area, listening to music.</em></p>

<p>I woke up not knowing if I had dreamed the dream I described in my dream or if I dreamed it during the dream.</p>

<p>So I asked this question on SO:</p>

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13598834/detect-select-status-of-options-in-a-multiselect-with-backbone-picky">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13598834/detect-select-status-of-options-in-a-multiselect-with-backbone-picky</a></p>

<p>There may be a slick way to do it without <a href="https://github.com/derickbailey/backbone.picky">Backbone.Picky</a>; it&rsquo;s curious that Derick hasn&rsquo;t touched Backbone.Picky in 6 months (since May 2012).</p>
