                        <p class=date>7:10am CST Thursday 27 February 2003</p>

<p class=dream>Riding my bike with Janette riding hers on some back
country roads somewhere, looking for places to go camping.  We ended
up doing a U-turn or something interestng like that.</p>

<p class=dream>Got back to the city ando Janette and I were walking
our bikes up the median of I-10; we had reached I-10 and I-20 almost
and she was asking me "is that I-10?"  "no that's the feeder for I-10"
and then we got to the actual I-10 and were walking our bikes up the
middle between the lanes of traffic and a motorcycle came zipping by
us sharing our same lane and then another motorccle came zipping by us
sharig our land going the other direction.</p>

<p class=dream>Then I was all "look behind us and tell me when there's
a break in traffic (so we could go across)" and she didn't hear me at
first and I saw the traffic slow down ahead of us and then beside us
and surmised that she didn't hear me because tehre must be a break in
traffic by now, so I told her again and somemotrocycles were beside us
and she goes, "oh now e can cross" and we crossed the highway all 4
lanes or so walking our bikes across then rode on the shoulder and
then stopped for a second and gazed out over some flooded areas
watchin people play and drive around in the flood.  Westopped for too
long though and got caught almost by a guy driving an official state
traffic truck and the truck coasted to a stop in front of us to nab us
and I was all "fuck that" and we were both on one bike and thought it
was more dangerous to go down this way (wit h my glove partway off) I
zipped down crossing all the lanes of traffic to the middle of the
highway and thecrossed them all again (to be very confusing) and got
to the bottom of the hill.  Didn't wreck.  Got away.</p>

<p class=dream>The guy came walking down the freeway ufreeway like
where peple can sleep under the overpas and he told us how dangerous
it was to do what I just did blah blah blah and he turned to leave,
waling up the ramp and <em>CONK</em>ed his head on the top of the
overpass though I had shouted "watch your head!!!"nderneath the </p>

<p>(haha I should have said Check your head!!)</p>

<p class=dream>And then I thought he must have been joking after what
he had just been bawling me out and the jerke back, hit his head
*again* and then fell and hit his head again on the ground.  Oh
jeeze.</p>

<p class=dream>So I jumped on my bike and drove away all crazy looking
for ice and found that I shouldn't go back up the freeway, but instead
went down the ramp into a hall andgot a locker basket of ice and a pan
of smaller crushed ice and then went up to him and put his head in the
locker basket of ice, and used the smalle shaved ice to fill in the
gaps and give him a full ice covering.</p>

<p class=dream>I really felt compassion for the enemy here, wanting to
o the right thing for him even though just 30 minutes earlier he would
have arrested me for plaiing on the bridge, but tha was just our
roles,; he was still a person and I still loved him.  I covered him in
sand so he wouldn't slide down the hill, but then he woke up and his
mom Julie Sexton came down and his siter (not Claire, but Carina
Dormio) and I told them waht happened and they ooh and ahhed over the
cut and wondered if he should get stitches and his beeper went off,
but it was my alarm.</p>

<p>Mac GIMP has arrived on CD to the house here.  Let's see if I can
install it with no problems.</p>

<p class=date>12:40am CST Friday 28 February 2003</p>

<p>I ended up installing OS X.2.  Got GIMP installed, but I can't use
it well yet.  Really need a right mouse button to use it easily.  Oh,
and XDarwin doesn't work on 10.2, at least not the version I had, and
according to the notes, won't be supported in future versions of GIMP
er, the other way around.</p>

<p>I can't send mail with my email thing now, and emacs stopped working.
Well, the OS X emacs quit.  The non-window version still works.</p>

<p>Going to bed.</p>

<p>Oh, I now have iChat, which makes all the text be in stupid little
talk bubbles to make it look like icons talking to each other.  I'll
see if the idea becomes likeable to me after a some usage.</p>

<p>I never got back online after I said I would; sorry guys (Calder,
Colleen, Dude)</p>

<p>Scott was parked behind Janette's van when she needed to leave.
"Josephine, would you like to drive on ice?"</p>

<p>"Um, no, not really."</p>

<p>"Would you like to move your car out of the way?"</p>

<p>Ah... when in that context, Josephine's need to drive is more
apparent.  I watched as she backed Scott up some, but then got stuck
on the ice in the slant between driveway and street.</p>

<p>Lots of tire spinning, slinging water across the frozen lawn.
After a bit, I came out to help.</p>

<p>Super thanks to my dad for showing me 20 years ago how to get out
of a trough with limited traction.  Back in the day, we had Mr Van at
the beach and he got stuck in soft sand.  Basically my dad drove back
and forth and back and forth, slowly carving a long groove in the
sand, up each side of the trough converting potential energy to
kinetic and back and forth until he got over the hump of the
trough.</p>

<p>So I did the same thing, rocking Scott back and forth with the
clutch and gas, leaving him in the same gear (1st at first, then
reverse when 1st didn't seem to work).  It was fun, and a good little
standard transmission practice for me.</p>

sliiiiiiiiiiiide so much fun fun fun fun!</p>

<p>I kept toward the cleaner icey parts, mostly away from obstacles,
most notably Johnny's truck.  (eeeek)</p>

<p>Slid around for probaby 2 minutes before parking and clocking

<p>My friend Ben Horne from KTRU (one of the cooler DJs there) is in
Kyrgyzstan!</p>

<pre>
From: Ben Horne <locolocoben@yahoo>
Date: Wed Feb 19, 2003  06:10:14  US/Central
Subject: another address

Dearest Friends, life in Kyrgyzstan is really good. 

So I have a ANOTHER new address (see below). It is because I changed
universities. This is for a bunch of reasons but primarily because the
guy I was working for (the University president) is a Soviet holdover
who thought he could oppress people with his richness. Props to peace
corps for representing and supporting me on this switch.

Obviously if I wanted a part of corruption and a power struggle I
would have stayed in the states and begun licking boots there. I guess
if the entire Kyrgyz country was like that, it would be a different
story, but in my analysis, this place is not so bad. The only real
problem is poverty and therefore, in my analysis, the solution is NOT
helping rich people get richer. 

There is still soviet influence and thinking (especially in the
government) but rarely, if ever have I met a man so selfish and money
minded as this man- and I dealt with the Rice U athletics dept. So I
guess, yeah, I have a problem obeying authority in general, so it's
not all his fault, but watching the poor get stomped on my corrupt
money does not make my top 10 favorite activities list.


So I auditioned at other places, and it turns out, (this is so absurd)
I am now teaching in the MBA program at the top academy in the
country. Absurd first because I don't have an MBA, or even want
one. Secondly because my principles are firmly set against big
business. But good business means the stopping of corporate
oppression, so teaching people basic _moral_ management principles and
economic policy is honestly something this country needs. If my
utopian plan works, I will help to will create a generation of
businessmen interested in the well being of the population as a whole,
not only their own wallets. This country's economy needs serious
growth to meet basic needs, so I am banking strongly on trickle-down.


I am teaching at the "Kyrgyz Academy of Management Under the
President", econonomics and Business English- business english being
primarily how to run a business meeting (I managed KTRU meetings,
right- I can teach this), make appointments (I own a pocket organizer)
how to interact (I would rate my hand-shaking ability above average),
negotiate (Rice athletic dept) etc. The truth is I know nothing about
business or English, making me vastly underqualified. But my passport
is blue, and I have a lot of self-confidence, and those two things
work together to make the situation.


I am vastly more comfortable teaching how to dress for a hip hop show
or a camping trip than how to dress for success but I have since been
wearing a suit and acting like I know what I am doing. I assure
everyone this external conformity of the tie and button-down in no way
diminishes my inner strides for understanding and freedom. (or at
least I'm convincing myself of that as I begin my own spiral toward
white-collar corruption.)


On the side I am also teaching at American University of Central Asia
(which coincidentally is the best undergraduate place to study), US
history as well as American Music Culture.  My greatest qualifications
being a DC residence and a CD collection, respectively. The great
benefit is hearing perspectives from people from all across the
region- Afghanistan, Turkestan, Turkey, and all, even Iran-and I have
not yet met a single one who supports war efforts with Iraq.


Really, peace corps in a capital city is life not a whole lot
different than normal, in some sense. Bishkek is like a big college
campus, and I am running around a lot of places doing all kinds of fun
stuff. It's wicked interesting, and I really hope we don't get
evacuated should world unrest happen. Honestly I'd much rather be
here than in DC; Kyrgyzstan is calm and safe and not at all a player
in world politics.


I am also involved with the government, as a consultant to both the
ministry of education and the ministry of labor.  My qualifications
there being that I have higher education and my mom was once in labor
with me, plus that I can say "government" in Russian and English
both.


Also I've become involved with a local hip hop group which is
charting well  (this week they beat Eminem and Nelly on the Bishkek
hip hop radio rankings). They are called the AP clan (AP meaning Asian
Power, not associated press), and they rap in Kyrgyz, Russian and
English.  I rap mostly in English, but my Russian and Kyrgyz are
coming fast. Basically my qualification for this group is that I once
saw the Wu-tang clan in concert, ostensibly making me cool.


I have also been talking to and working with some other local NGOs
that work with press freedom, my qualification here being that I once
wrote an opinion column for the Thresher, my college newspaper.


And so other than that I have been learning to cook (from eating raw
beans 2 months ago my skills have rapidly developed) with only basic
ingredients and no ready made flavorings or papa johns. 


And playing a lot of basketball, maybe 5 times a week, and I dare say
that my skill level has surpassed my high school days (I think if I
were on the team again now I may have gotten off the bench maybe 3
whole minutes per game).


And of course the mountains. I have purchased and entire head to toe,
real, legitimate North Face gore-tex outfit straight from china for
100 bucks, about 12% of its retail value.  And some crampons. Climbing
season begins in 2 months, and scores of peaks between 12,000 and
16,000 feet are less than 15 miles from my soviet housing block. Think
50 mount Raniers, all accessible on a 2-day trip, right outside your
door.   So far it's just been day hikes through the foothills in
the snow, with 2 minor peaks, but I can't wait for the spring. 


I actually went skiing once, solely for the reason that I cannot think
of anything more that terrifies me more after I bit it hard for 15
stitches in the face at Whistler last year. Honestly my goal was to
make it through the day without an emergency room visit. 


That was an interesting experience in that the lift is a rope you
throw over a cable and let it drag you as you ski UP the
mountain. Needless to say I wiped out more frequently than I was
successful making it up.


As far as safety goes, when my binding malfunctioned the lift
supervisor said there were no more skis in my size. He asked me if I
was a good skier. I distinctly said "NYET". He said, he thought
I was pretty good and that I should just borrow his personal skis, a
freestyle pair (yes, I know the word "freestyle" in Russian. It
is pronounced "freestyle"). He said they were great for doing
360s and jumps. I said I didn't need to do jumps, I just needed to
go slow and stop. He said the only disadvantage of freestyle skis is
that it is impossible to stop, but that I would have no problem.  At
this point I was growing nauseated, but I knew this was a fear I had
to confront, so he launched me on to the top lift, and up I went all
the way to the top.  I made use of speed control by constantly
falling. Unfortunately one time the ski came off, and indeed, they do
not stop. So I skied (fell/ slid) halfway down the mountain on one
ski. Then I was relieved to learn that the lift was closing early for
the day and I was still alive.


Rock over Bishkek.  Okay, here's my NEW address ñparentheses my
additions, followed by a not-too-inaccurate account of my relationship
with my old University. It was written in a time of extreme sarcasm,
and in no way is representative of Kyrgyz People in general, who are
for the most part very hospitable and likable.


Kyrgyzstan

Bishkek 720040

Panfilova Street 237

Academy of Management under the President (of Kyrgyz Republic)

Benjamin Horne

(Kyrgyzstan)


(note: not a transcript, but a summary of 6 weeks of negotiations and
oppression at that academy. Okay I have taken a few liberties, but the
details requests and commands he makes are actually all true. The only
thing I exaggerated is the actual bluntness of language involved in
the exchange)


MY RECTOR : you must stay at this academy 48 hours a week. 

ME: Uh, I like this place but my contract says I will only teach 20
hours. In general I have a real personal problem with mundane daily
routine and lack of freedom. It would be better if we followed what my
contract says. I would be really happy.


HIM: I am a soviet and I think it's important for you to spend the
remainder of the time sitting in an office staring at the wall.


ME: I can help the country a lot more if (in my free time of course) I
go work with an NGO of two, and maybe meet with some officials to
discuss issues. I promise not to miss a single minute of my
classes. I'm a reasonable man...


HIM "I exercise wild authority." (note: an actual quote)You will
do what I tell you. Didn't our academy purchase you from the Peace
Corps?


ME: Hmm, the US government pays for my food, stipend, loan deferment,
medical care, transportation, etc, so it's not exactly like you own
me. My Peace corps job description and contract specifically say I
should have time free from my university to do other projects with the
community. It would be more beneficial overall for the country as a
whole. I am obviously not helping anyone by being chained to my desk. 


HIM: My child, my child, this is Kyrgyzstan. I am a very wealthy man
with a Japanese toilet and magnetic soap in my posh apartment
(true). Who must I pay off to make you do what I want? 


ME: you can't pay anyone, you slimy corrupt egoist. Obviously I am
not motivated by money, hence the fact that I'm a volunteer. I will
arm wrestle your ego right now, toe to toe.  Humility is a virtue I
haven't fully learned yet, and unfortunately for you, wealthy men
on power trips are my #1 target.


HIM: you are wrong, and very young and naive.  The only worthwhile
people are old and experienced; people your age generally polish my
shoes. Here, write this recommendation letter for me so I can go on
this program to America. Then sign and date it with the name of my
colleague.


ME: "{the best line from Rage Against the Machine "killing in
the name of"}"


HIM: yes, you WILL do what I tell you. And when you are finished come
here and give me and my family private English lessons


ME: Are you kidding me? You are picking the wrong American to try to
exert your will, you close-minded commie.  You are not the first
tyrannical university administrator I have tangled with.  I will bring
the ruckus and lead these students in a rebellion to firebomb your
Japanese toilet. 


HIM: It's too late, I just paid off some key people. You are
officially my slave. Live in fear. Or I will make you work Sundays
too. You stupid Americans think you can get what you want just because
you have "education". 


ME Ok I will quit. Yeah, take that you big bully.

HIM : How?

ME: I'll just find a new University-it's actually not that hard,
I will say-" uh, I will work for free- do you want me?"


HIM You think you're a hotshot, don't you kid, Well now instead
of teaching students, why don't we cancel some of your classes so
you can give me personal interview pointers. 


ME: I think you need general "respect for people" pointers, you
oppressive czar.  I just interviewed and auditioned with another
school.  They treat me, the other teachers, and the students with some
modicum of respect, unlike your mini-kingdom here. I am starting there
tomorrow.


HIM: How is that possible, isn't my money good enough for you?
Look, I have auto-flush. 3 bidet settings.  Electronic sensors that
conform to your contours. Custom seat-heating. Take what I have
offered you graciously and bow down.


ME: Sorry, I'm too fueled by aggressive rap and eddie vedder's
angsty rebellious days, kingpin. I would rather starve than eat your
bread. Take a look at the people living in ghettoes all around, that
DON'T have maids and an SUV. Guess why I came here-not to make you
even richer. Later skater. This penitentiary ain't the place for
me.



So I don't think I misrepresented that. Hope you enjoyed this
latest book. Stay True. Tell me what's gone down. One Love.

<p>I need the money, but I might as well be happy with a snow day off
from work!  Soon as Janette gets off the phone we'll go for a walk in
the icy outdoors.</p>

<br>Hi, Rob,<br>
<br>
Most of Austin is getting a day off. Jon went to take Alicia to the grocery store and I might go return library books that are due today, but the library may not even be open. The temperature is still below freezing so Jon is worried about frozen pipes when it gets warmer. No one will know a pipe breaks if the water in it is frozen. He checked our outside faucets. I&rsquo;m sure Dallas got more ice than we did.<br>
<br>
How&rsquo;s your cut foot? You found a use for duct tape, anyway!<br>
<br>
Nice that you&rsquo;ll have a going away party. Instead of attending the party, maybe I&rsquo;ll send the gas money I would have spent driving to Dallas.<br>
<br>
I talked to Madeleine last night and they have had plenty of snow, including 3 more inches yesterday and more on the way. She and Dick plus two of his brothers and their wives are going to Slovakia soon. They&rsquo;ll all meet in Chicago on the 20th of March and fly out on the 21st and return on April 4. It&rsquo;s a shorter trip than they wanted, but coming back on the 5th would double the air fare!<br>
<br>
The Austin Rally is this weekend, so I&rsquo;ll probably stop in to see what&rsquo;s going on. Did Fred tell you about the young adult group we&rsquo;ve started? Several members are former YRUUers&ndash;KT Hammons, Katie Lukach, Nathan Ryan, Laura Andress, Laura Ingram, Lauren ? (or is it Lauren Andress&hellip;I forget), Ben Atkinson, maybe some others. Kate Robinson came to one meeting but she moved back to Houston. We meet on Wednesdays and will join a Buddhist group for a silent Walking Meditation this Friday.<br>
<br>
Enjoy the ice!<br>
<br>
Love,<br>
<br>
Ma</p>

<p>Slid over to the park where a guy with a mini snowboard (plastic
skateboard with no trucks) was being pulled by someone with a rope.</p>

<p>Josephine's friend Jeremy also had a snowskateboard; we slid down a
small hill with it some times for pretty good entertainment.  Janette
went back and got a cookie pan (the round one I gave to her), which
was sturdy enough almost, but not quite the best suited for sliding on
snow since it has holes in it.</p>

<p>The trickiest trick I did at the park was sliding down the spiral
slide and shooting out the bottom onto my butt.  Oh, and the coolest
trick I did was jump out of a swing and slide across the ice.  The
coolest thing I did not try was sliding off the roof of the pool house
onto the ice.  I chose not to pursue anything higher than jumping off
the public phone, since I slipped backwards when I landed.</p>

<h1>Bibby Blowout</h1>

<p>Okay, if you know me and (Janette or Josephine or Jack), you are
invited to a party at the Bibby's house Friday night March 14 - Sunday
afternoon March 16 (and beyond if it's your Spring Break)</p>

<p>Bring some kind of food (uncooked pasta or fruit) or a present for
Colleen Crotty or Ashley Powell (the unbiological twins, assuming they
will be here).  March 26 is their birthdays, and that's the day I'm
leaving for Japan, so it's a combined party for all of us but still
time for me to get ready and freak out before I leave.</p>

<p>Alright stop
<br>shut down the city
<br>ice is back
<br>and looks so pretty
<br>something
<br>covered the streets lightly
<br>snowed like a monsoon
<br>frozen all nightly
<br>
<br>will it ever stop?
<br>
<br>yo, I dunno
<br>actually the sleet is ice, not snow
<br>to the the extreme
<br>throughout the night like a vandal
<br>shut down the city 
<br>worse than the latest scandal</p>

<p>Yeah kinda lame, but this commemerates the Great Ice Storm of 2003
over Dallas.  Though just now it seems to be letting up.  There's
sleet about 3 inches thick over everything.</p>

<p>I drove Scott off the street into the driveway in case people start
playing demolition derby tomorrow morning instead of staying in bed.</p>

<p>It was impossible to see through the windshield covered in ice,
plus my contacts were out so I couldn't see anyway.  But I drove with
the car door opened and got Scott parked behind Janette's van well and
easily enough that one might not have guessed I couldn't see
clearly.</p>
