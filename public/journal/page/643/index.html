                        <p>Yesterday at KTRU I played an entire show (2 hours) of only bands that have
animal names in their name:</p>

<p>Band names like Iron Butterfly, Dead Horse, Hepcat, The Frogs, The Gerbils,
Michelle Gun Elephant, Radiant Pig&hellip;  you get the idea.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find enough such bands from playlist to meet playlist requirements
(4 from playlist per hour), so I played songs that had animals in the title.</p>

<p>AND!
I will be at KTRU thursday afternoon from 3-5pm and Friday afternoon
from 5-7pm  and Friday evening from 11pm to 1am.  Then I might be at
montrose radio from 1am to 3am.  Or not if I am too tired!</p>

<p>Montrose Radio?  Yes; they used to be a pirate station in Houston, but are
now Web based broadcast only:  <a href="https://www.firstamendmentradio.org">www.firstamendmentradio.org</a>.</p>

<p>I went to one of their meetings and I might begin to DJ there as well.
We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

<p>Drew sent us a funny turkey day picture:</p>

                        <p>I found it!  This is my beautiful description of what journal.cgi does:</p>

<pre><code>It reads files in the /journal directory (and below) allowing users to read
through various items.  It allows me to just write a journal entry and drop
it into the pile; I don't have to update the index.  It uses CSS to give an
aesthetically pleasing look to each entry with minimal HTML code written in
each entry.  Also, it includes some fun logic to treat files with different
extensions differently:  for .txt it prepends and appends &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt; tags.  .htm
and .html files are simply regurgitated.  All .jpg .jpeg .gif are displayed
as inline images.  Also, if no file parameter is given on the command line,
it looks for any file with 'description' in its name.  If found, the file's
contents are displayed.  Otherwise it will display the contents of the last
file in the directory.  I am prepending the file names with two digits (the
date) so the default action is to display the most recent file for the user
to read.  Users can just bookmark a location and it's magically up to date.
</code></pre>

<p>Also today at work I found something else:  An add-on for MS Outlook that will
extract an attachment from an email.  I spent a week looking for one to do
it on the unix side.  Found it in 10 minutes on this side.</p>

<p>See ya!</p>

                        <p>Over the weekend Wende and I spent a lot of time together.  It&rsquo;s
certainly nice to have her home!  We have not jumped right back into a
sexual relationship; she has asked that we start over &lsquo;new&rsquo; and that
has certainly been a challenge for me.  I can see the value in it.</p>

<p>On Saturday she joined me at the Altar Allstars meeting (we who are
creating the Altars for the <a href="https://www.heartstormproductions.com">Techno Cosmic Mass</a>
called ourselves Altar Allstars) where we hashed out a general framework
that each altar will use, and brainstormed some on the specifics for
each one.  We also created deadlines for plans to be turned in.  We need
to hurry!!</p>

<p>I enjoyed getting to say HI to and sit beside Madeline.  I&rsquo;m glad she
and Wende have finally met; I think there is no jealousy or weirdness.</p>

<p>Saturday afternoon and overnight Wende and I were at the Houston Rally
Planning Lock-in.  The Houston Rally will happen in January 2000
(assuming the planet doesn&rsquo;t explode) and this overnight event was
just to plan the Jan 2000 weekend event.</p>

<p>I have been the &ldquo;adult in charge&rdquo; of the Houston Rally for the past 3
years.  This year I am not.  I stayed mostly out of the meetings,
listening while lying down on the edge of the circle, or while playing
Go with Martha (I stomped her) then with Ralph (he stomped me).</p>

<p>I slept from 11pm to 6am or so.  Nice.</p>

<p>I have mixed feelings about not being in the thicket of rally
planning.  Good feelings of relief mostly. I basked in great memories
of Jason and I pulling of huge awesome Saturday Night Events.  Jason
has graduated and wasn&rsquo;t even at the meeting this weekend; I am ready
to allow someone else be in charge.</p>

<ul>
<li>-</li>
</ul>

<p>Afternoon on Sunday Wende and I helped Christine and her friends paint
her house.  Actually Christine was feeling pretty sick (stress,
allergy type stuff) and we painted for her as she talked as chattily
as she could with sore throat.  Watching that dynamic really got me
thinkin&rsquo;&hellip;.  how has Christine created friendship bonds that will
bring peeps over to her house to paint while she&rsquo;s sick?  Would my
friends do that?  (yes actually) Would I be able to ask them for the
help?  (That&rsquo;s the bigger question) I felt envious in a way; inspired
in another.  Not sure where to go now as I write this.</p>

<p>In the evening, Wende and I went to movies with Maggie, John, Molly,
Will, Meredith, Eric.  We saw The Messenger and I loved it.  I was
overwhelmed with love for Joan played by Milla Jovovich (so much so
that I memorized how to spell her name).. just the <em>passion</em>
she embodied. incredible.  Something gentle inside me said &ldquo;you can do
that too&rdquo; (where &ldquo;that&rdquo; means &lsquo;inspire others so greatly&rsquo; and not
&lsquo;lead a huge army into war&rsquo;)..  So huge.  wow.  Go see it, but know
there is lots of blood.</p>

<p>Then home to our separate apartments and to bed.</p>

<hr />

<p>This morning I recognized suddenly that I haven&rsquo;t meditatively written
a &ldquo;things to do&rdquo; list in quite a while.  I did so this morning and I
think today (and this week) will be a happily productive week!</p>

<p>I wrote a beatiful description of what index.pl is designed to do.  Absolutely beautiful.
The beauty is that it actually correctly described what it did and it was easily read and
made sense, and it was all perfectly justified.  Same number of characters per line&hellip;&hellip;</p>

<p>And I can&rsquo;t find it!</p>

<p>Okay, so yes, 11-19-99 was yesterday, the last odd day for a long time.  I may write more
on that.  Um, o I&rsquo;m off to a meeting now for planning the big <a href="https://www.heartstormproductions.com">event</a>
and then to a lock-in overnight with my youth.  Planning for big rally in January.  Yay!!</p>

<p>Gotta shower and get ready for overnight in 12 minutes!</p>

<p>I think tomorrow is Tammy&rsquo;s birthday&hellip; hmmm.</p>

<p>Yesterday was my KTRU day!  I had great fun at the station, and even
recorded the show.. but it wasn&rsquo;t as incredible of a show as, say,
last week&rsquo;s.  Dasscool though; still great fun.  Oh!  And I got to
give away movie passes to two different movies and as I wrote the
winners&rsquo; names down on the list, I noticed the name of my friend
Carsley!  Woah!!  So I called her (I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s a violation of some
law - using the KTRU information for personal purposes) and left a
message on her machine!  (She called me back later in the evening and
we chatted about work and stuff; it was great to connect with an old
friend!)</p>

<p>After KTRU, I grabbed lunch then picked up Madeline and drove to Ares
Robotics, where Richard, Dion, Madeline and I brainstormed ideas for
the Techno Cosmic Mass coming December 9 to George R Brown!  My
project is to create an altar to water; and I have a pretty good idea
in my brain of what I want to do; I just need to get my ass in gear!</p>

<p>Dropped M back off at school then I went home and took a delightful
nap.  I just love a nice afternoon break like that.  Turned the phones
off and everything.</p>

<hr />

<p>Woke up; worked on website stuff (Rebecca&rsquo;s Indigo Angel site (which
will be at <a href="https://www.indigoangel.com">https://www.indigoangel.com</a> soon but) for now is at
<a href="https://indigoangel.cjb.net">indigoangel.cjb.net</a>) and email and then Rebecca called!</p>

<p>She answered a question I had about her site and then I asked her a
couple questions about my life and stuff (she&rsquo;s a professional psychic
and has a pretty good sense of my dynamics) and she spouted a
delightful bounty of Astro Babble (so she calls it) the I greatly
appreciated!  Like when my energy is low (emotional, spiritual energy)
I tend to seek out others for attention and approval and lovin&rsquo;
instead of re-energizing and nurturing myself through <em>sleep</em>
maybe or eating or play or whatever.  hmmm..  The seems so basic now
that I&rsquo;m saying it, but I found it hugely beneficial last night.<br />
Thank you, Rebecca!</p>

<p>It was late; I was tired so I went to bed, heeding my internal signals
instead of forging ahead with &ldquo;gotta get my website done!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This morning I woke up refreshedly happy and moved 3 months worth of
geocities site over to here!</p>

<hr />

<p>Going to work now.</p>

<p>OH WAIT!!</p>

<p>I forgot something and remembered when I saw the name of this entry!</p>

<p>A few minutes ago, I could hear Spot flippin&rsquo; and floppin&rsquo; around in
my bedroom.  Spot is normally a friendly and happy cat, but is
normally too cool to flip and flop around.  I went in and found
several small feathers and Spot&rsquo;s new toy.  He grabbed the bird and
ran under my bed.</p>

<p>I thought, <em>ug - I don&rsquo;t want to chase you, Spot.</em> and he ran
back out!</p>

<p>Yay! He dropped the bird and I gently grabbed Spot by the scruff (I
love that cat-handle) and said &ldquo;good job, Spot, but keep it outside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thought about tossing the bird out the window, but had visions of Spot
retrieving it.  No.  So I ceremoniously flushed it with a gentle
prayer to the bird, &ldquo;thank you bird, for participating in the cycle of
life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>FUULUUUSHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>Well, archived.  It looks like my project that I&rsquo;ve worked 2.5 weeks
on at work will be shelved until it may be needed again.  Mine used
JavaScript and HTML to store data on a users local machine while
offline and then allow them to submit the data to us when they were
back online again.</p>

<p>The biggest concerns were the wide variety of browsers and screen
sizes made the look-n-feel too varied across thousands of users.  I&rsquo;m
cool with dat.</p>

<p>One &ldquo;good&rdquo; thing for me is that I get to move on to a different
project.  I like moving on to different projects; it&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve done
all my life!</p>

<p>So now I&rsquo;m looking for a unix daemon that will watch for email to a
certain address and strip attachments from the email to a certain
directory.</p>

<p>I wonder if I could just do it with pine???</p>

<p>Hmmm.  What&rsquo;s that about? &hellip; I wondered.  I recognized I was trying
to fulfill a need within myself by hanging out with her.  That&rsquo;s not
going to work.</p>

<p>She encouraged me to ask myself what I wanted to do and then simply do
it.  She was wonderfully more eloquent.</p>

<p>Thank you, M.</p>

                        <p>01:54 Sunday 14 November 1999</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m so tired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Today&rdquo; I went to George R Brown Convention Center for a planning
meeting for the Techno Cosmic Mass that will happen on 9 December
1999.  The TCM will be super awesome and you should all attend!  It&rsquo;s
free!  <a
href="https://www.heartstormproductions.com">www.heartstormproductions.com</a>
is the URL for the event I think.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s free for all!</p>

<p>Based on a rave type atmosphere, it will be a straight-edge (that
means &ldquo;no drugs&rdquo; (for us straight-edge types)) combination of imagery,
live and recorded sound, music, singing, rapping, spiritual stuff, big
giant altars to the four directions/elements, just just just amazing!</p>

<p>Come join us on the 9th!  Or, if you want to help set up the thing,
<a href="mailto:thunderrabbitATcheerfulDOTcom">email me</a>!</p>

<hr />

<p>There were about 20 people at the planning meeting, including a cute
girl named Madeline.  I notice her as soon as she walked into the
room.  Turns out we kinda noticed each other, but didn&rsquo;t really talk
until after the planning thing.  We are working on the team that will
build the altars for the four directions.  I&rsquo;m in charge of the water
altar; she&rsquo;s in charge of the earth altar, and actually she is the
head leader type person for all the altars.</p>

<p>She asked if anyone could give her a ride home and I volunteered.</p>

<p>We spent pretty much the whole day together (noon to 10:30pm).  Went
to High Fashion Fabrics and talked and asked questions and laughed
lots about all variety of things.  We discovered we both love Tori
Amos.  We spent a pretty long time there until I was getting quite
hungry.  (Madeline is apparently a fabric junkie).</p>

<p>We took flyers for the Techno Cosmic Mass to Soundwaves, Chemistry
Records, Record Rack, and Cactus Records.  Oh, and one more place but
I don&rsquo;t remember the name.</p>

<p>To Mission Burritos where we ate a burrito each and laughed more and
more.  Acorns fell on our table a few times; we shared inside jokes;
we just had a blast talking.</p>

<p>To Amy&rsquo;s Ice Cream, where we saw Heather from KTRU and told her about
the upcoming event.  Ate ice cream and I stories about YRUU and sign
language; lots of laughing and fun.</p>

<p>Then to Madeline&rsquo;s house, where she read about my birth numbers: <sup>27</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub>
and we found that under the surface (into our inner workings and
&ldquo;issues&rdquo;) we are actually amazingly similar.  We have similar
relationship patterns, similar driving forces, just similar stuff.</p>

<p>To her room, where we listened to Tori Amos (and PJ Harvey for a bit)
and talk talk talked.  There was a bit of sexual tension present, but
we were both wise enough to know it would hugely damage our innocent
relationship.</p>

<p>Talk talk talk until 10:32pm when I left for Ultimate frisbee at UH.</p>

<hr />

<p>Chased the frisbee and Justin around the field (that sounds bad) and
had a great time.  (When Justin and I are on opposite teams, we like
to cover each other.  We are both better at offense than defense when
one of us covers the other.)</p>

<p>Played 3 games between like 11pm and 12:40am.  Drove home, called
Madeline at 1am.  Number is disconnected.  Redialed.  Same thing.
Redialed.  Same thing.  DOH!!!!</p>

<p>Dug through the phone book, racking my brain for her last name.  T
something.  Ugh.  This sucks.  20 minutes of scanning through all the
last names that start with T in order to find one that kinda looked
familiar.  Nothing.</p>

<p>Took a shower.  Wrote this entry.</p>

<p>02:16am now.   Good night.</p>

<p class=date_>20:41 Thursday 11 November 1999</p>

<p><p>This part of robnugen.com is so close to being ready.  I think there&rsquo;s just two more things I want to add:  One is to have index.pl send me email if it has an error.  Two is to get the CSS nice, but that&rsquo;s not critical.   I can hopefully get the email part figured out tonight, and Dude can help me with the CSS over the weekend!  (He&rsquo;s got a cool little book on it)</p>

<p><p>Today I added logic to index.pl:  If no file was chosen on the URL, look for a file with &lsquo;description&rsquo; in its name.  If it exists, display it!  If such doesn&rsquo;t exist, display the last file (alphabetical order) that exists in the directory.   My goal was to allow descriptions in the &ldquo;root&rdquo; directories of years or the whole folder, and when in a folder full of files, make the default file be the most recent.  (Assumes I prefix all file names with 2 digit date of month.)</p>

<p><p>It works, and I love it!</p>

<p><p><hr></p>

<p><p>Today I had a most cool day at work.  I am 1 itty bitty bit away from being done with my SAS / JavaScript / HTML project!!  Did I describe it already?  I think I did.  The last little bit that I need to add will check for missing data and prompt the user to add it.  I thought I could get it done tonight, but the SAS syntax was messing me up.  I needed to simply concatenate a string  (string = string + &lsquo;}&rsquo;) but I couldn&rsquo;t figure it out.</p>

<p>Okay, now I&rsquo;m going to work on the email part of this.</p>
