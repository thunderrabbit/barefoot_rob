<p>Weird shit.  My virtualbox won&rsquo;t open any of the virtual boxes,
including the one I just shut down to figure out what&rsquo;s going on.</p>

<p>Now when I tried to push my journal to bitbucket I get a weird error:</p>

<pre><code>$ git push
No user exists for uid 502
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
$
</code></pre>

<p>Same error when I simply try to rsync:</p>

<pre><code>$ rsync -r public/* newrobnugen:/home/nrnc/new.robnugen.com
No user exists for uid 502
rsync: connection unexpectedly closed (0 bytes received so far) [sender]
rsync error: error in rsync protocol data stream (code 12) at /BuildRoot/Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/rsync/rsync-47/rsync/io.c(453) [sender=2.6.9]

<p>Yesterday I taught three lessons down near Minami Machida.  The third
was with a student who creates music.  He said he likes my art, and I
talked about how it&rsquo;s the quantity we need to worry about instead of
the quality.</p>

<pre><code>You take care of the quantity.
I'll take care of the quality.
    - God
</code></pre>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s from The Artists Way.</p>

<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s not something I&rsquo;ve really been practicing, so I need to
get my proverbial butt in gear or something.</p>

<p>AND, while walking to work, all barefoot and wondering about the
mysterious future, I figure I can&rsquo;t keep doing compooter stuff fo-eva
(the younger generation is going to come kick my ass sooner than
later) so I need to start creating art again.  Put it on Patreon and
Canvas and blah blah blah.</p>

<p>SO, tomorrow while I&rsquo;m waiting in the immigration office applying for
my permanent visa, I&rsquo;m going to draw.</p>

<p>Tomomi, Lin&rsquo;s friend from her ex-work, is my third Tomomi to know
now, though I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll stay close in touch with her since
she&rsquo;s Lin&rsquo;s friend.</p>

<p>We ate yummy quinoa, salad, bread, and ice cream!  Tomomi asked me
about my barefootedness and I asked about her job and how things are
going at Lin&rsquo;s old job.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve probably hear of blood blisters.  I have one on my thumb, a
result of clipping some thick twigs with scissor-sized loppers a
couple weeks ago.  The skin of my thumb got caught between the handles
as they thunked together and boom instant blood blister.  Yay!</p>

<p>A couple days earlier I had done the same thing to my index finger.
Scissor-sized loppers and oops blood blister on my finger!</p>

<p>Except there&rsquo;s a difference.  Two weeks later, the one on my finger
still hurts.  The one on my thumb stopped hurting at least a week ago,
and is just waiting for the skin to slough off.</p>

<p>The finger one has a slight lump under the skin and still hurts a
little if I press on it.  I&rsquo;m calling it a nerve blister!</p>

<p>Just for fun, I&rsquo;m at the clinic near our new house; I have some time
available as my afternoon meeting was canceled and the clinic is right
along the path between the station and our house.</p>

<p>I super doubt the doctor will suggest anything besides pain meds,
which I will politely refuse&hellip; but I just wonder if there&rsquo;s anything
to do with it besides wait.  I wish I could talk to Dr Cutie!!</p>

<hr />

<p>The recommended I go to a skin clinic, and gave me a map to the clinic.  Synchronistic: I had <em>just</em> walked &ldquo;randomly&rdquo; down near the skin clinic, so I knew exactly where it was and how to get there.</p>

<p>Okay a weird thing happened the other day.  A friend of a friend
offered to let me use her crib for lessons, but she smokes so I don&rsquo;t
really want to use the place.  (I&rsquo;ve been there before.)  I told my
friend my concern but asked friend not to tell her.  Friend told her
anyway and she got all pissed off and said nevermind, plus I hereby
quit (lessons, not smoking).</p>

<p>Dang.  I told friend not to say anything.</p>

<p>Had a good lesson with 3 students this morning; they are working on
their presentations, and progressing quite nicely!  Right now we are
just memorizing, but in the future I will show them how to speak &lsquo;off

<p>Today&rsquo;s lesson with GG was Part II of hard drive disassembly.  We
opened the outer case in Part I, and have now opened the hard drive
itself.  &ldquo;The platters are like mirrors!&rdquo;  and the warranty is
officially void.</p>

<p>Headed home now on Odakyu Line from Shinjuku.</p>
