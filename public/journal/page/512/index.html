<p>Yesterday after work I invited Joel (who I met at Katharine's
party) to join me at Paint This! for some creative artistic fun.  I
also called Dude and Veronica to invite them.  Veronica answered; dude
wasn't home yet; she said she'd call me back.</p>

<p>Joel arrived and invited me to dinner at some buffalo wing place.
I called Veronica to say we were about to go eat so she wouldn't show
up at Paint This! and wonder where we were.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad you called!  I couldn't find your number.  Do you want
to come over for dinner?"  They were offering chicken something with
alfredo sauce and angel hair pasta and asparagus.</p>

<p>"Can I bring a friend?"</p>

<p>"Boy friend or girl friend?"</p>

<p>"Boy friend."</p>

<p>"Okay."</p>

<p>I'm sure she didn't care what gender my friend was, but was just
being curious.</p>

<p>- - - - -</p>

<p>Left my bike at PT!; told Jennifer I'd be back by 9 (when she
closed) to get my bike and see her all dressed up for some thing she
and Bobby were attending.</p>

<p>Arrived at Dude and Veronica's; introductions; chillin' while they
were still cooking.  I had had visions of dinner already ready.  Might
not be back by nine.</p>

<p>Doorbell rang three separate times as Amy, James, Maz all showed up
for this party.  Woah!  What an incredible surprise!</p>

<p>Called Jennifer, "I'll pick up my bike tomorrow," and had a great
dinner; Gene is the pimp-ass-bomb cook!  wow.  Gene is D&V's roommate
right now after getting laid off from his IT job.</p>

<p>Maz told the short version of his epic trip across country as he
moved from Houston to New York, trying to get there in time for a
wedding.  This story is screenplay material!</p>

alt='Rob the ape'></a> After dinner we gawked at this
hilarious/tragic/brilliant website that I'm sure gets zillions of
hits: <a href="https://www.hotornot.com">hot or not.com</a>.  I am so
offended and amazed at the brilliance of this site.  I even put <a
href="https://www.hotornot.com/r/?eid=SSSLKY&key=SLR">one of my
pics</a> on it.  The one of me catching a frisbee under my feet that
was on the front page of the Daily Cougar back in the day.</p>

<p>- - - - -</p>

<p>Joel had to go home so I confirmed Dude could take me back to my
apartment.  I got home around 12 midnight.  What a great fun
night!!!!</p>

<p>During lunch today Wende and I met with Jodi to make sure everyone
is all cool and on track for having Jodi be our real estate agent.
We're going to sign paperwork and such on Saturday and get the house
sold soon.  I think we should be able to make a few dollar profit on
it while we are at it.</p>

<p>I told Jodi that it's my intention to visit London with Bryn in
March.  She said she'll keep that in mind, so we can hopefully close
by February.  Whoohoo!!</p>

<p>I'm in a better working mode today than yesterday; have a good
start on a little tool that will make editing datasets hella easier
than previously.  I think I can make it pretty flexible too.  Hope so
at least.</p>

<p>Shwew.  My website is back online.  I'm glad there's not a lot of
people trying to purchase my domain!</p>

<p>Right now I'm on a conference call with the people for whom I wrote
my most recent project.  Probably should pay attention to it.</p>

<p class=date>4:44pm</p>

<p>Conference call is over.  Lasted about 1.6 hours.  I IMed with Bryn
some to keep myself entertained.  Awesome organization that I'm going
to check out: <a
href="https://www.usexperiment.org">usexperiment.org</a>!!</p>

<p>Tonight at ASL I will perform "on top of spaghetti" which I
practiced at Fort Worth with Bryn and Phat Pat!</p>

<p>Somehow I let the registration of robnugen.com lapse.  I guarantee
that if I had received a reminder, I wouldn't have.  I'm curious to
know if I did get a reminder and paid it but wasn't credited or didn't
get a reminder or what.</p>

<p>But it's all good.  Proof is that you are reading this entry now.</p>

<p>I bought my domain for 10 years this time.  $15 per year is a bargain!</p>

<p>Last night after the rally I basically went straight to sleep.  I
woke up after some hours, and felt like it was 4 or 5am.  It was only
9:52pm.  Quite an amazing experience in time perception.</p>

<p>Woke up again at like 2am and then 6am I got up for real.  Vacuumed
Wende's house as part of our agreement on keeping it clean while it's
on the market.  It's not on the market yet, but I vacuumed it just for
practice.  I wonder if she called Jodi, my real estate friend who will
list it for us.  I just left a message for Jodi to find out.</p>

<p>Just played a few rounds of Sardines.  I got
sidetracked talking to a guy who described the
architectural changes made to the church.  They aren't
exactly subtle changes, but I hadn't really scoped
them all out.</p>

<p>Oh, so anyway, I was last to find Meg Cusack
because of talking to Dan. So, therefore I got to hide
next.  I hid behind the gas meter behind the air
conditioners, using my training from the Katy Robinson
school of Sardines, <em>hide where it's dark and
scary.</em></p>

<p>I was there about 10 minutes at least before anyone
found me.  Simon was all, 'I'm going to go out but I
won't tell anyone you're here.'  As soon as he walked
somewhat out of the area, 'they're back there.'  Tsk
tsk.</p>

<p>Next round, I found Katy once about 50% of the
others had found her.</p>

<p class=date>12:43 am</p>

<p>Sean's visor and $50 are missing.  That sucks big
butt.  I mean, he had Pulp Fiction screenplay on it. 
C'mon who would take his visor???</p>

<p>I have often wished that my super hero power would
be that I can point to any specific object.</p>

<p class=date>1:53 am</p>

<p>Talent Show included lots of stuff.  Just did the
monkey song with phat pat, Nathan s, me acting like
monkeys.  I preened them both and almost collided with
Nathan a couple of times in our monkey behavior
bouncing.</p>

<p>Then Pat, Bryn and I did On Top of Spaghetti in
sign and then did a pretty successful 3 headed
monster.  Great fun stuff.</p>

<p>I fell asleep on the floor before the end of the
talent show, and slept maybe 2 hours as the rally
wound down.  On my way to bed (my thin inflatable
mattress under a table) I was sidetracked by a crisis
starring Erin, who was hyperventilating and stuff. 
She's pretty stressed, it seems, maybe over some abuse
in her history.  I sat on stage behind her, placed my
hand on her back and sat in silence with my eyes shut,
visualized golden healing light into her Being as two
or three youth tried verbally to help her relax.</p>

<p>One of the adults at the rally is apparently a
doctor of some variety.  She arrived and asked
western-medicine questions.  I just held the energy
until they went elsewhere.</p>

<p>I got to sleep around 4:15am.</p>

<p>Touchgroup meeting starring Nathan S as our leader
and Katy from Austin and I as the only remaining
members.  The touchgroup is over and Scottie just
walked up, 'there y'all are!'   pshh.  yeah.</p>

<p>Sean has the entire text of Pulp Fiction on his
handspring visor.</p>

<p>Katy says, 'bloop.'</p>

<p>This rally is relatively small, Laura C notices.  7
newcomers altogether.</p>

<p>Samantha Nagel, Erica's sister is here!  Quite a
fun surprise; I remember meeting her at her first
rally - like Dallas 1997 or so.  Cool beans!  Now she
is here with her boyfriend person who Erica thinks
looks like me.</p>

<p>He and I disagree.</p>

<p>Before opening circle, crazy bouncing balls in the
concrete floor sanctuary.  Wheee!!!</p>

<p>Bryn and I traded books; I gave her Way of the
Peaceful Warrior, and she gave me one on travel.  I
gave her the recommendation that I wrote for her for
some scholarship thing.</p>

<p class=message>'fast and loose'' baby, after
teaching the dog to read that is, that's how i play
it.</p>

<p class=grafitti>hello lalalalala  i cant type at
all</p>

<p class=message>Good luck to me(laura) on being
coherent. It's late and im sleepy, but i am quite
excited about the rally. Balloon animals, yo! and i
have been having some serious silent football
withrawal since i haven't played since SWUUSI. looong
time. and how cool is the rally bandana idea? pretty
darn spiffy. except that mine sticks up funny and
makes me look like a priest or somethin. except for
the whole female thing... that's kind of a tip off
that im... well, not.. Rob is over here asking Kate
about random stuff. learning about her. yay for that. 
<br>'dude, i dont get this. the dining room has
carpet; the rest of the place has tile. this is messed
up.' -Dan/Doc
<br>random thought of the day: 'Massages are like
orgasms, you can give one to yourself but it's a
helluvalot better when someone else gies it to you.'
-me
ok im gonna shut up now, i love you, Rob!      -laura!

<p>The mime/balloon lady was pretty funny.  She gave
Sean her camera and he recorded her for a while and
then I recorded the rest of the antics, for a grand
total of abouut 2 hours.  She never spoke a word, but
was certainly funny.</p>

<p>Super funny was when she fake tripped oer someone's
foot and then measured it with her hands down at his
foot: one hand at the toe and one at the heel, and
then stood up and looked astonished as her hands were
fully 3 feet apart!</p>

<p>Sean and I joked about balloon inflation that we
could not do in one breath like the guy at Tulsa, and
the guy (Troy) at San An.  Funny stuff.</p>

<p>I slightly skinned my knee trying to film her
inflating the balloon with her little machine.</p>

<p>Bedtime now.  Relatively early for me, but hey.  I
wanna play SF and have to drive home.</p>

<p>Bryn telling people about her OZ trip during

people from me.  </p>

<p class=date>9:25 am</p>

<p>Bryn harassing me in front of the same breakfast
bunch about my cut foot at Salt Lake City.</p>

<p class=date>9:56 am</p>

<p>Morning Worship now.  Discussing the 7 UU
principles.</p>

<p>Sean:</p>

<p class=message> rob is duct taping his feet cause of
the stickers in the fuckin field. 'say goodbye foot
hair' 'just give me one small bandaid!' his foot looks
like a air duct i guess. 
now he's telling me about his foot scars from GA
'99(?)  it goes like this: cut foot; hop hop hop;
puddle puddle; sock; sock; shoe; shoe; clean; clean;
trash; worship; dance; ultimate; take care of cut.
good job rob.
<br>now he's definatley 'got something in his hand'
possibly a splinter, or itty bitty piece of glass</p>

<p class=date>1:24 pm</p>

<p>Played ultimate with duct tape still on my feet,
sandals, duct tape holding them on.  Worked very well.
</p>

<p>Then lunch and now I'm going to take a nap.</p>
