<p>Today has been a really long day.</p>

<p>I'm still at work.  Actually Kevin, Minh, and I are
still at work.</p>

<p>AND!  We got the latest and greatest version of G3
online and workin' fine.</p>

<p>Well, mostly fine; there is one project that is not
using the latest features, but I can incorporate those
later.  Now the G3 has mega-enhanced security.  (I can
say mega-enhanced because it used to have a huge
security hole that we only just noticed a few days
ago.  So compared to that, it's mega-enchanced.  But
really, it's just good security.)</p>

<p>This is verison 3.01 of the G3.  I used the touch
command to set the file date to 08 August 2001
03:01am</p>

<p>Nice.</p>

<p>I'm going to bed.</p>

<p>Actually-- about that:  I rode my bike to work
today, and I can ride it home starting now and get
home in 20 minutes all hot and sweaty.  Or I can wait
for Kevin to be done and he'll give me a ride.</p>

<p>I'm choosing to have Kevin give me a ride; it will
be safer and easier for me. If he's not ready until
much after 11pm, though, I'm audi 5000.</p>

<p>Relatively happy today; busy busy at work, but
getting some good stuff done.  I discovered a huge
gaping security hole in the G3.  That will be quite
effectively patched in the new version, due to come
out tomorrow (! yikes !)</p>

<p>Ate at Mission Burrito with Wende tonight.</p>

<p>There's more going on, but like some of my peeps on
livejournal, I'm choosing to not disclose each detail
of my life.</p>

<p>Work is stinky in that I keep getting stuck doing
stupid stuff. And one of our clients sent an email on
Friday to Dennis, requesting something, and Dennis did
1/2 of the request and forwarded it to me only today.
</p>

<p>I called the client and apologized; it was too late
to do the next part of the request.</p>

<p>We are likely to open the site and get this
person's feedback and then run the reports for
her.</p>

<p>I don't *think* the reports have already been run,
but the point is that we have to do extra crap to make
it happen.</p>

<p>Wow.  I'm practically drenched with sweat.</p>

<p>This morning I had 3 flat tires on my unicycle and
bicycle combined.  Fortunately, there is a gas station
with a free air hose within a few blocks of us.  The
air hose is not always working, and I didn't want to
walk both cycles down there and find it unusable, so I
just walked my uni there.</p>

<p>The air hose was working, so I inflated the tire
and rode my uni all the way back, no worries.</p>

<p>Then came the hard part.  I rode my uni while
holding my bike upright beside me.  I wasn't carrying
it off the ground, but it was quite difficult to lean
all the way over to reach it, so I did lift my bike up
<em>some</em>.</p>

<p>I'm not sure that it was faster than walking my
bike, but it certainly was a lot more challenging.  I
had to keep mentally cheering myself on, "you can do
it, ROB!  You can do it!"  Pretended I was in the
olympics for the Unicycle Riding Bike Walk
competition.</p>

<p>So incredibly sweaty after I made it to the gas
station.</p>

<p>Filled up my bicycle tires and rode my
<em>bike</em> back and carried my unicycle over my
shoulder.</p>

<p>Sweat pouring into and burning my eyes.  Good
exercise for the day.</p>

<p>Now I'm going to go ride my bike to work and get
some shit done while no one is there to bug me.</p>

<p>I woke up what I believe is too late to ride to
Maggie's today, <em>and</em> meet my dad, Karen, Elis√©
at noon at Willowbrook.  So I'm just going to install
the Slime Liner and maybe ride around downtown.</p>

<p>I just suddenly thought of a cultural shift type
thing that I think will happen as technolgy encroaches
on lots of parts of our lives.  The question comes
from seeing the following:  People signing up for
cards at grocery stores, the exxon fast pay card,
credit card, movie watching cards, library cards. 
Normal stuff, right?</p>

<p>Right.  But then what happens as the databases in
the back end are all merged?  The library, the movies,
the grocery store  everyone has an awareness of
peoples  of indiiduals living habits.  What faborite
moies we have  what books, what foods.  etc etc etc. 
</p>

<p>So the point is that 'computers' will know lots of
aspects of indiiduals identities.. then if people want
to hide part of their identity or create two
identities like in The Matrix, won't that be way way
harder?</p>

<p>Maggie, I looked up that actor we couldn't place. 
<a href="https://us.imdb.com/Name?Cheadle,+Don">Don

<p>Today Wende and I scoped out <em>The Princess
Diaries</em> with my dad, Karen and Elis√©.  Movie was
cute; I cried a bit - just at the magnitude of what it
might be like for a 15 year old to suddenly learn s/he
was royalty.  That could be one of my YRUU youth.</p>

<p>On the way home from the movie, we stopped at
Maggie and John's and had great spaghetti and watched
<em>Southpark, Bigger, Longer, Uncut</em> on DVD. 
After we watched it, I started watching the French
version and was <em>quite</em> impressed with how well
the audio matched up with the animation.  Not that the
animation is good, but I was still impressed.</p>

<p>I'm super tired; going to bed.</p>

<p><em>Rush Hour 2</em> was great!!  Super funny and
lots of great Jackie Chan action and Chris Tucker
attitude.  The entire theater was packed and laughing
significantly at several scenes in the movie.</p>

<p>Fun plot twists and surprise character-connections
in the story.</p>

<p>The outtakes at the end are great.  Especially one
involving a cell phone.  Wow.  I could watch 2 hours
of outtakes.</p>

<p>We (Maggie, John, Meredith, Eric, Wende, I) saw it
tonight, opening night.  The theater was packed, but
we got there early and got seats all togther.  Munched
at Fuddruckers afterward.  I had a bowl of cheese soup
which they serve in a "bowl" carved out of a round
loaf of bread.</p>

<p>When Wende and I got home, I was like, "dude,
where's your car?"</p>

<p>Doh!  We forgot it at her work.  So we drove back
out to her work to retrieve it.</p>

<p>Now we're home, about to go to bed, but I wanna
write an entry about today first.</p>

<p>During work, I rode my bike to University Schwinn
to get a spare tire and tire changing kit and stuff so
I won't be totally screwed if I get a flat way out
somewhere.  On the way back I realized I still don't
have a tire pump, but.. at least I have a spare tube. 
I also got something called Slime Liner, which is a
thick layer of translucent green plastic that is
designed to go inside the tire between the tube and
tire.  It is guaranteed to keep the tube from being
punctured.  (but not sidewall punctures, where the
Slime Liner isn't protecting the tube)</p>

<p>Back at work, where I hopefully will actually do
some work.</p>
