<p>So surprised when Misato gave me and Lin matching tiger eye bracelets
today!  I had commented on Misato&rsquo;s bracelet last week (and apparently
praised it too much!) cause it caught my eye, and I had never seen
dark tiger eye before.  Super striking!</p>

<p>I guess this means I should buy her something kinda special from my
trip.</p>

<p>I probably should have gotten a picture of our matching bracelets.</p>

<p>Actually not lunch, but after the NWTA meeting, I worked on AB and
then hung out with Tomoko from 2:05pm to 2:50pm.  Midori was off
today, so I didn&rsquo;t get to see her.  We talked about badminton and
Mari-chan, who is in the badmintion group and happened to be with
Tomoko when she let me in.</p>

<p>Today was the 3-weeks-out meeting for we staff of the
<a href="https://nwta.mkp.org/">New Warrior Training Adventure</a>
(<a href="https://nwta.mkp.org/">NWTA</a>) in British Columbia, Canada.  It was a
good meeting; we each have a buddy and each man on the call checked in
for his buddy, with the presumption that the buddies have been in
touch with each other.</p>

<p>I was inspired after the call and reached out to my two teams via email.
I look forward to meeting everyone!</p>

<p>Today (and most Thursdays) I taught at SCC in Kawasaki.  Naoko
reviewed for her test next week.  Yasu reviewed the same material for
his test sometime in the future.  Azusa did much better with her
fluency and intonation for her presentation.  Liliko asked about the
brochure that has to change soon to accomodate new opening times.</p>

<p>After the lessons I went to say HI to Tomoko and Midori, but Midori
had the day off.  Tomoko showed me how to RSVP on Circle Square for
next month&rsquo;s badminton game.</p>

<p>Marble Track 3 is not my #1 priority; I am happy to work on it slowly.</p>

<p>*) Rewriting in Gatsby / React makes sense if I can learn along the
 path to creating it.  How do you feel about going slowly, to help an
 old newbie learn along the way?</p>

<p>Basically, I do the work, learning along the way, you get a per
month retainer, for minimum 5 months?</p>

<p>*) What income streams do you see for Marble Track 3?</p>

<p>*) I got a gatsby-driven blog skeleton going, but have not integrated
Airtable.</p>

<p>*) I ain&rsquo;t sold on Airtable yet; I was not even able to get a Hello
World working after 35 minutes of poking around at existing templates
and staring at the interface</p>

<p>*) currently I have scripts that make different image sizes (2 for
now, but more can be easily added)  Where do images get stored in your
setup?</p>

<p>Finally figured out why the sorts were not working on AB; I changed
the way GET parameters were cleansed and did not set it to cleanse all
60 required to deal with 20 DataTable columns.  Now it works and is on
the live site.  It is apparently working well, but AB will have some
change requests by tomorrow night.  We will discuss them on Friday.</p>

<p>Right now I am in a free lesson at work; usually-consistent-Hide did
not come to class, and Shinji and Akiko rarely come to class.</p>

<p>I am zooming through some Gatsby JS tutorials to get ready to talk to
Fust tomorrow about possibly redoing MT3 site with Gatsby.</p>

<p>Although I have not gotten all the way to the part of MLAPHP that we
are supposed to be adding tests, I am close enough that I can add some
tests. They have helped a <em>lot</em>, like OMG how did I live without
tests?  It hasn&rsquo;t been so long that I don&rsquo;t remember what it was like,
and I sure like this better.</p>

<p>Right now I am working on upgrading to a new version of Datatables so
it can access <code>table.row()</code> but I get the error</p>

<pre><code>Uncaught TypeError: table.row is not a function
</code></pre>

<p>It&rsquo;s not just not a function&hellip; <code>table.row</code> is <code>undefined</code>.</p>

<p>Maybe 1.10.19 of datatables is not the latest after all..</p>

<p>Tomoko invited me to join 今さん and peeps for badminton.  They play
monthly at the Kawasaki something something Center, down 区役所どり
from JR Kawasaki station.</p>

<p>I had so much fun that I did not notice a blood blister formed and
burst while playing!  I gave the raquet back and was like, &ldquo;oh hang
on; lemme wash that blood off of there&rdquo; haha oops.  I knew it was a
bit sore, but did not noticed I had worn all the way through the skin.</p>

<p>Miyako joined after a while.  She has to work tomorrow so chose not to
go out with everyone afterward.</p>

<p>I went out with everyone afterward, and the waitress did a good job
dealing with all our myriad orders.  Her voice reminded me of Mila
Kunis, the actress who plays Meg in Family Guy.</p>

<p>Tomoko said they would probably stay out until 2am or so so I went
home by last train.  I was able to sit down (and sleep) on a train
that terminated in 登戸 and in a train that terminated in 新百合ヶ丘.</p>

<p>A man named Fust has recommended a new stack for Marble Track 3:
Airtable as backend, Gatsby as frontend, and some other things I have
not heard of.  Actually I had not heard of Gatsby.</p>

<p>I have an old VirtualBox sitting around so I spun it up and loaded a
Gatsby demo.  It pooped out a bunch of deprecation warnings, so I am
loathe to really dig into this thing if it will be an ongoing battle
against a bunch of deprecations ongoing during the project, as well as
making the marble track itself.</p>

<p>Oh it refreshes if I updated the .js, but not if I update the .html in
public/.  Fair enough.</p>
