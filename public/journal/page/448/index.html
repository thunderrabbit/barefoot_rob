                        <p class=date>3:23am EDT Sunday 13 October 2002</p>

<p>Tonight after visiting the Quad pub thing with Joana et. al., and
me being beaten by Floyd at pool, we visited Brent and Greg's room to
watch <em>Silence of the Lambs</em>.</p>

<p>Cool thing in the room is that the futon, made into a couch, was
sitting up on the arms of some wooden chairs, creating something like
stadium seating of couches to watch the movie.</p>

<p>Joana had never seen the <em>Silence of the Lambs</em>, but now she
has.  Once Brent and his posse arrived, 45 minutes into the movie, we
restarted it for them.  Brent and I laughed a lot and were impressed
with the coolness of Hannibal Lecter.</p>

<p>During <em>Silence</em>, pizza was ordered.  Caycee couldn't stand
the thought of eating nor even smelling the pizza.  Rest of us chowed
merrily.</p>

<p class=note>(If you don't like gross, don't read the rest)</p>

<p>After <em>Silence</em>, Joana left, and some of the rest of us
watched <em>Hannibal</em>.  I enjoyed the movie much more completely
this time, including laughing and being again impressed with Hannibal.
Stuff like placing Patsy's phone back into his jacket pocket before
hanging and disembowling him.  Also saying "good evening" to the
younger hired goon before slashing his throat.</p>

<p>This time the parts of the movie that gave me such fits when I
originally saw it seemed to go by much more quickly and easily.  I
didn't even pass out in that one scene where Mason cut his own face
off.  I watched when the pig ate his face off, and during the sauteed
brain scene.</p>

<p>How nice.</p>

<p>After the movie, we lifted down the futon while one of the girls
remained mostly sleeping on it.  And converted it from a couch to a
bed.  Then I left.</p>

<p>Good evening, and good night.</p>

<p>I'm at lunch at Ali Baba's on Kalamazoo Mall, a brick one lane one
way street, the history of which was summarized on some concrete
podium base thing at one end of the street.</p>

<p>Weather is beautiful for walking bright sun through brilliant blue
sky and trees full of leaves considering the idea of changing hue for
the winter.</p>

<p>To order lunch I requested the "least expensive high protein meal;
I don't care what it is."  Result = a greek burrito with lamb,
tomatoes, pickles, lettus and some mystery sauce.</p>

<p class=date>12:42pm</p>

<p>Lovely lunch.</p>

<p>I randomly started reading the phone book and found a page of
missing children "Have You Seen These Missing Children?"</p>

<p>Missing children is certainly no fun for everyone involved.  There
are lots of missing children in these surrounding states, I'm sure.</p>

<p>So why, oh why, is one of the missing children still featured here
when by now he is 29 years old?  He's 2 years younger than me, and has
been missing since he was 5 years old.  How possibly could this age
progressed picture be accurate?  How possibly would his family and him
have anything in common to talk about?  Any ties, any bonds, anything?
It just seems weird to me.</p>

<p>I have just arrived!  Joana is going to give me a tour of campus.</p>

<p class=date>5:54am</p>

<p>Joana gave me a tour of campus and I told her stories, prompted by
names of cities so far on my trip.  At 2:15 or so she went to sleep
and then I fell asleep reading an interview of foreign affairs expert
Thomas Friedman in Rolling Stone.  Just woke up, finished the
interview, going back to sleep.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>Walking with Barbie maybe, and came across a house
under construction.  I needed some 2x4s to use as stakes in my house
to help me sell it.  Inside the garage of this house (not mine) I
found some pieces of 2x4 about 4 feet long with pointy ends to use as
a stake.  Found four pieces.  Also found 4 smaller pieces to be used
for something else.</p>

<p class=dream>Barbie motioned for me to wait, as I had began to walk
out the door; she wanted to wait for Dr Dre who was also in the garage
getting some stuff that he needed.  While we waited, the owner of the
house came into the garage and caught us stealing his shit.</p>

<p class=dream>He asked what was the next thing I intended to do with
the boards I had.</p>

<p class=dream>"Um, go to my house and use them as stakes."  I had
decided not to lie and get myself in more trouble.</p>

<p class=dream>He asked if I had been there to his house
previously.</p>

<p class=dream>"no"</p>

<p class=dream>"really?" he asked, as if to make sure I hadn't
forgotten about it.</p>

<p class=dream>"yes I have never been hear before.  Today is my first
day."</p>

<p class=dream>"You didn't steal a shirt from me that said Marathon on
it?"</p>

<p class=dream>"no, but I read abotut it in the newspaper."</p>

<p class=dream>"Anyone could have heard about it on the news" he
said, trying to make that statement implicate me.</p>

<p class=dream>I made a joke, yeah Barbie said the samething, "if
I..they stole it they could just look down and know what it said on
the shirt."  She had said 'I' but I switched the word to 'they' at the
last minute to keep him from thinking she was really talking about
me.</p>

<p class=dream>"He tried to use magic marker and make it look like a
top ten countdown."</p>

<p class=dream>"Reeealy?  I did not know that." I considered this next
part before saying it.  "With all due respect, this shirt will be a
lot mor valuable after it's been so famous."</p>

<p class=dream>He rolled his eyes.</p>

<p class=dream>"I know this is not the type of publicity you'd like to
get, but it's true."</p>

<p class=dream>He said something about fifty dollars for the shirt,
but I thought he was offering to let me pay fifty dollars for the wood
and let me off without prosecution.</p>

<p class=dream>"Okay" and I reached for my wallet because I had fifty
dollars in it.</p>

<p class=dream>He looked confused.</p>

<p class=dream>I was all, "I thought you were offering to
acept fifty dollars from me so you wouldn't prosecute me."</p>

<p class=dream>No response.</p>

<p class=dream>"I'm just trying to stay out of jail.  If fifty bucks
will do it, then that's fine."</p>

<p class=dream>He considered a moment and then accepted the offer, but
then said something like , "blah blah blee bloo and your friends won't
be implicated."</p>

<p class=dream>I was all, "what?"</p>

<p class=dream>He spoke again, but this time it was different, so I
recognized I was dreaming, and woke up and kept my fifty bucks.</p>

<p>Super awesome thanks to Jenny at <a
href="https://www.peoplesfoodco-op.org">People's Food Co-op</a>,
downtown Kalamazoo's only natural grocer who bought me an apple for
lunch.</p>

<p>I went inside when I saw "food co-op" thinking, that's exactly what
I need!  But they often work on a scale more like lots and lots of
food, like word for an hour and get 5% off $100 worth of food
purchased or something like that.  I was all, "hmm. I was hoping more
along the lines of ones of dollars instead of hundreds of
dollars."</p>

<p>She bought me an apple without anything expected in return.  I'll
write her a letter from somewhere.</p>

<p>I'm so thrilled to discover soy milk in my magic box!!  I drank one
last night on my way from Oberlin to Kalamazoo, and this morning Joana
offered me some cereal.. except she had no milk.  "I've got some soy
milk in the car!"  Wow how totally perfect is that??  Thanks to
Janette for such a wonderful magic box.</p>

<p>They had a couple of dirty dishes in the sink, so I washed those in an attempt to earn my keep.  I still don&rsquo;t really know what else I can do quite yet.</p>

<p>Joana arrived home from class about 20 minutes ago, and seemed poised on the couch adjacent to the futon where I slept.  I was  all, &ldquo;what would you do if I weren&rsquo;t here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excellent.  Go to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So she is sleeping now while I took a shower and am now
internetified.</p>

<p>I'm at the Kalamazoo Museum.  The peeps at the front counter
greeted me and after a short conversation said I should check out the
Trail of History, for there is a letter written by someone that's
really interesting.</p>

<p>"Who?" I asked.</p>

<p>They didn't want to give it away.</p>

<p>"I see..  the mummy...." I said mysteriously, for we had just
previously been talking about a mummy on level three.</p>

<p class=date>2:35pm</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>I'm only on the first floor of the three story museum, checking
out three new interactive things I hadn't previously seen at a
museum.  They have the tornado simulation (cylinder of air with fan on
top and vapor (dry ice?) emitted from the bottom), which I've seen
before, but they also have three other things:</p>

<p>1) Glass half sphere about four feet in diameter with water filling the
bottom spherical half.  A variable speed fan above the water whirls
the air around inside the thing to simulate no wind, or wind wind, or
storm winds.  The water sometimes whips about and splashes within the
sphere.  Cool stuff.</p>

<p>2) Glass full sphere about two feet in diameter, with sand filling
the bottom quarter, and the rest full of water.  The sphere itself may
be spun by hand (only on vertical axis), causing the water and sand to
whirl around in possibly fun ways.</p>

<p>3) Vibrating rubber mat with sand on top, simulating the earth
rumbling, according to the sign.  Not variable speed vibration, but I
can press firmly down on the mat and stop or dampen vibrations on a
certain area, causing patterns to emerge in other places.  Not nearly
as cool as the violin bow on metal, but still pretty cool.</p>

<p>Okay, upstairs now.</p>

<p class=date>2:55pm</p>

<p>Aight.  I'm in the Trail of History, and I haven't seen a letter
yet.  Will I miss it?  There is plenty plenty plenty to see and read
here.  Lots of hidden elements.  Presumably a letter so cool will be a
featured part of the exhibit.</p>

<p class=date>4:26pm</p>

<p>I gave up a long time ago on finding that mysterious awesome
letter.  For at least the past hour, I've been building a two motor,
four wheel car, that can run on this track they've got set up.  Six
little motors to choose from, and a whole pile of K'nex toys to build
with.  Thing is, they only build well in two dimensions.  They don't
really have a piece that will support structures radiating out in all
three dimensions.  Getting over that hurdle is what took the longest.
I never really did it; I ended up making two cars and rubberbanded
them together kinda like a train.</p>

<p>Talked to a cat who just got back from Japan doing some research.
He works in this museum now and today is his first day.  They told
him, "go out and play with stuff."  So that's what he's doing,
exploring the museum.</p>

<p class=date>5:02pm</p>

<p>I successfully built an arch out of foam blocks designed for such.
However, this was quite a challenge more than I might have expected.
Haha to the sign that said, "can you build an arch by yourself?  of
course not!!" and then went on to say some bullshit about teamwork.
haha.  The guy whose first day was today said, "good job!"</p>

<p>I've left now because the museum is closed.  Those who were at the
front desk are gone; I may never know who wrote the letter I never
found.</p>

<p>Two dorms competed in volleyball outside and Joana got me grab and
run on her board card.  I played the first prequel game that didn't
count and it was way fun.  During the best of three competition,
Crissey (Joana's dorm) won the first game 21 - 17, then they lost 21 -
4, then lost 21 - 17.  Awesome fun, just like my college days!</p>

<p class=date>8:40pm</p>

<p>Joana and I just watched <em>The Princess Bride</em>.</p>

<p>After watching <em>The Princess Bride</em>, Joana and Caycee wanted
to have a party.  Josh (?) Caycee's boyfriend was all, "you can't have
a party without some preplanning.."</p>

<p>Josh doesn't live nearby, so Joana and I went upstairs to someone
else's suite (Brent and Greg?) where some people were studying, and
some were zombified by the TV and/or pot.  Once the studiers quit
studying (not that they finished, but they were all, "well I'm not
going to get any more done tonight"), I kept offering games we could
play Silent Football, Mafia, Dead Fish, Truth or Dare, The Jackie
Purdy Game, Two Truths and A Lie, and none of those fully
materialized, but a few of us played 2 Truths and a Lie.</p>

<p>Then about five people came back from seeing "Red Dragon" and I
blurted, "were you amazed by how the bad guy..." and I tried to not
give away any of the movie, but I did and I felt dumb, but maybe no
one else cared.  I hope not.  Oh well.</p>

<p>We went to the room where people were mostly hanging out and then
they all went to a strip club on the rumor that a girl from their high
school was working there.  They left and Joana and I chatted with some
cat whose name I've forgotten.</p>

<p>Then we went downstairs and cut up magazines to make a collage, but
I was pretty much too tired so I went to sleep on the futon.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Next (this) morning I learned that Joana didn't get to her room
until late because Caycee and Josh were still there past 2:30am, when
she fell asleep on Meagan's bed.</p>

<p>I don't know when (or how she knew she could) go back to her room,
but that's where she was when I got up this morning.</p>
