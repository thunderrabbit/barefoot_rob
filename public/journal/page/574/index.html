<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class="dream">I was talking to some of my homies just as it was time for
me to begin my KTRU shift.  I ran down the steps to the station and put on
a different CD and then was cueing something up, but missed the end of the
previous song and was tapping a button that made a slight squeak over the
air.  I was pressing these squeakng buttons, making a slight squeaky music
collage thing.</p>

<p class="dream">My friends came down to see what I was doing and when they
saw, they were all, "oh my god.. well that's KTRU for ya.  always playing
crazy music."</p>

<p>I woke up and determined that the squeak was actually something spinning
around and around.  I imagined a youth in a bored tired trance like state,
spinning a barstool chair around.</p>

<p>I couldn't sleep with the incessant squeaking, which became more
constant.  I determined that the youth must be *in* the chair, or it would
be going much faster spinning around and around.  I considered saying, "I'll
give you one million dollars if you quit spinning that chair."  Instead I
rolled over on my side and slept again.</p>

<p class="note">(dream)</p>

<p class="dream">At a KTRU meeting, I presented my case, "I'd like to do a
weird experimental show that I just make up as I go - squeaky noises and
stuff and tapping the mic and just whatever.  I won't hurt any equipment.. I
could do the show from like 4 to 7am or something."</p>

<p class="dream">"I guess it's time to tell him," someone said, "about
moving the station to Florida..."</p>

<p class="dream">I immediately knew that this was my last semester; they
were moving the station and for whatever reason I was out.  I gave everyone
a big big big hug, thanking them for all the fun times..</p>

<p>and I woke up.</p>

<p>I woke up and the chair was still being squeaked.  I got up.  It was the
hampster running in his wheel.   Hahahhaa.</p>

<p class="date">10:11 am</p>

<p>About 3 youth are awake - John, Matt, Beth.</p>

<p>At Maggie's now.  Susie took John, Matt, Beth home.  I played pinball and
then Lindsey woke up.  We talked and played billiards and watched cartoons
"Chicken and Cow" on Cartoon Network.</p>

<p>Called Wende's cell phone and found her at Maggie's.  Lindsey and I left
essentially at the same time.</p>

<p>At Maggie's we watched The Holy Grail and I just had lovely tortelini.
Thanks Maggie!</p>

<p>Wende and I have just arrived home from Maggie and John's house.

<p>We watched <em>The Fifth Element</em> after <em>Holy Grail</em> and
I fell completely in love with Milla Jovovich again.  (I fell in love
with her the first time when I saw her as Joan of Ark.)  I love her
eyes and mouth and nose, in that order.</p>

<p>Wende said I could marry Milla Jovovich if Wende can marry Bruce
Willis.  I told her it was a deal.  If any of you have contact
information for either of these two people, let me know.</p>

<p>After the movie, Will and I played billiards.  He was kicking my
butt and had sunk all but 2 balls.  I still had 6 balls on the table.
In an amazing feat of inadvertant pool sharkery, I sank 5 in a row.
Will and I missed our last shot (not counting the 8) a few times each,
and then I got mine, but scratched while shooting for the 8.</p>

<p>Before supper, we all played Clue, and I must say it was more fun
with the youth than with this group.  People in this group were too
scientific about it and got upset when they were surprised by cards
not being where they were apparently expected.</p>

<p>Ironically, I paid the least amount of attention to the game, and
wrestled with Scout (Molly and Will's dog) a lot, but still won the
game.</p>

<p>Dinner was fabulous as always at Maggie's.  We had sausage, carrots
and black eyed peas for good luck.</p>

<p>We played the Text-o-Grams game (same one as last night, and I just
made up this name that I might stick with for this game.  We'll see if
the name sticks.) - three sheets of paper worth.  I will put them in
my scrapbook.</p>

<p>emacs is working on the 20th ring from the main stack, and
subsequently working on moving the 16th ring from the second
stack.</p>

<p>Bedtime now.</p>

<p class=date>10:47am CST Sunday 31 December 2000</p></p>

<p>I have been on my computer all morning, composing an email to the
KTRU list in response to someone who was wondering if we will get a
massive outbreak of viruses at the turn of the clocks tonight.</p>

<p>I basically said, just be smart about how viruses work.</p>

<p>Then I watched emacs play hanoi.  Basically there is only the
sixteenth ring blocking the nineteenth ring from moving.  So it will
be working on the twentieth ring probably tomorrow.  I watched it for
many minutes, working on the algorithm that it uses to know which ring
to move where.  I maybe have almost got it.</p>

<p>I'm behind schedule from where I wanted to be.  I'd still like to
take the uni in to the Schwinn place and still have to get ready for
youth group and play all day today.  Yay!!!</p>

<p>Oh, and I have to buy batteries for my Handspring Visor and take it
to work to get re-synched.</p>

                        <p class=date>8:20 pm Sunday 31 December 2000</p>

<p>I drove over to the church to find no youth.  Stayed there for a while
reading a book that described a different theory of the life of Jesus,
indicating taht he faked his death and resurrection.  Interesting.</p>

<p>Then drove to the Robinson's house to say HI and hang out until it was
time to meet back at the church.  Talked with Meg and Katy; guessed
correctly at which room was whose, and had lovely pizza rolls made by
Susie.</p>

<p>No we are here at First Night, an outdoor New Year's festival celebration
thing and it's FREEZING cold with drizzly rain and slight wind making for
freezing fingers, wet toes and a cold nose on everyone here.</p>

<p>Our job is simply to staff a booth selling hot chocolate, hot coffee,
cookies, M&Ms, and beverages (cokes and water).   We didn't have to *do*
anything.  The festival organizers set up the booth and supplied all the
stuff we're selling.  We just yell "we need more hot chocolate!" and they
bring us a new 5 gallon jug full.</p>

<p>We each got a free meal of a burger and fries, and one complimentary coke
and cookie each.  Pretty nice for us as an easy fund raiser - we are getting
either $36 each or $36 as a group per hour for the night; I'm not sure
which.  I think.  I'm just here to support the youth group and have fun.</p>

<p>I've started the evening at 4pm wearing socks, shoes, sweat pants and
sweatshirt material hoodie.  But that wasn't really enough and thanks to
Suse and Kevin, I have a scarf thing, sweat shirt, and gloves.</p>

<p>Thanks to one of the booths, I have a plastic bag for a hat to keep rain
from soaking through to my skull and stuff.</p>

<p>I spoke to some of the other youth groups staffing identical booths
(there are 4 booths identical to ours in what they're selling.  One group is
raising money for trips this summer to Mexico and to China to do missionary
work I believe.</p>

<p>I've flirted to the best of my ability with all the booths that are
selling these cool colorful hats of sheer nylon material (the kind of
ripstop material they make kites with) to see if I can get a hat.  But I
haven't been successful.  Three booths, lots of flirting.  No hat.  (But I
got this plastic bag... it's a start.)</p>

<p>I *did* however, catch the eye of a woman named Joan who asked my age and
relationship status. She said a few times that I'm very cute.  Aww yeah.
But still no hat yet.</p>

<p>On my long break from our booth, I walked over to the Sunny 99.1 big
inflatable sun advertising thing as they were taking it down.  The cool
thing is that they got inside the sun to take out the light that hangs
inside it.  I didn't ask loudly enough to get my chance to climb inside.  Oh
well.</p>

<p>I've actually been sitting inside a nearby building to write this entry.
I'm pretty warm (mostly) by now.  I can feel my fingers at least.  I'm going
back in quest of a hat.</p>

<p class=date>8:38 pm</p>

<p>Got back to the booth area and everyone was packed up and leaving.  Susie
waited for me.</p>

<p class=date>9:10 pm</p>

<p>Susie (advisor)  drove me to the church to get my car and we caravanned
to Susie's (youth)  house, but no one is here.  We are now sitting in
Susie's car, not sure where peeps are, except we know Meg and Hethre and
Nick are on their way over.</p>

<p class=date>9:24 pm </p>

<p>We are at Susie's house.  Matt says, "oh that's crazy!" to my Visor here.
A not-so-funny funny thing is that Rachel fell asleep on the way here and
they left her sleeping in the car.</p>

<p>They have a laser pointer with about 50 different tips, including a
"naked lady" silhouette.</p>

<p class=date>12:02 am 1 January 2001</p>

<p>We played the line of text line of heiroglyphs, line of text, etc.  the
game that Bryn and I made up back in the day.</p>

<p class=message>hi this is Lindsey. Happy New Year Uncle Rob!!!!</p>

<p class=date>12:14 am</p>

<p>Now we are playing Sardines and trying to find Lindsey.</p>

<p class=grafitti>hey this is very neet and im not sure i spellede neet
corectly</p>

<p class=date>3:04 am</p>

<p>We played sardines for probably an hour plus, and I think John and Meg
and Katy had the best spots. John hid behind a chair, and Katy was in part
of the attic, and Meg hid under the blanket on the couch with people
watching TV.   Matt hid under a bed with chest of drawers holding it up.</p>

<p>Then we played Mafia for a few rounds and I was mafia twice.  One time my
mafia partner was killed on the first round, and I still got 75% or so of
the rest of the peeps.</p>

<p>Then I pointed to myself when mafia was choosing who to kill first. They
killed me so I played pinball while they finished the game.</p>

<p>Then a quick jaunt out to the trampoline where it's totally soaked and
covered in leaves, so we bounced around a while - Katy, Lindsey, Matt and
I.. then the girls left and Matt did a back flip with full twist.  I did a
couple of back flips and front flips.  By then everyone was on their way
inside, so I went in too.</p>

<p class=date>3:41 am</p>

<p>We just played Ceiling Wall Floor.  Played a few rounds, but they gave
the answer away.</p>

<p>Now Beth is playing the knife and fork game.</p>

<p class=date>5:41 am</p>

<p>After knife and fork we played the camping trip game.  "I'm going on a
camping trip and I'm going to bring ______"  A secret made up rule
determines who can bring what.  The other players try to determine what is
the rule.</p>

<p>After this game, John, Lindsey and I played on the scooters outside.  We
rode on them with the scooters turned backwards, with one foot on each
scooters, sitting down on the scooters, two people both with one foot on
each scooter among other configurations.  Once we were chilled (barefoot)
inside we played billiards with Matt and Beth.</p>

<p>and then Matt, Beth and I went out on the scooters again, this time I
wore shoes and my hoodie, which was good because I got tired and lay down in
the street after a while.  Matt rode both scooters and over (straddled) me
as I lay on the street.  Fun stuff.</p>

<p>Bed now.   Matt and Beth are cleaning up the kitchen, which I greatly
condone.</p>

<p><em>Miss Congeniality</em> was really funny.  Funny funny funny.  I
wonder how accurately it portrayed behind the scenes of a pageant...
Some of the funny was silly funny.  All of it tied together neatly
into one little movie.  All good stuff.</p>

<p class=date>11:58pm CST Saturday 30 December 2000</p></p>

<p>Tonight we hosted Darby and Rob's baby shower here at our house.
It was pretty much our first "party" type thing that we've had here.
I'm glad Wende was able to relax enough to allow it to happen.</p>

<p>Party was fine - lots of peeps from Wende's work, fun and lots of
laughter.  Spot and Peter got out of the garage when someone peeked in
while exploring the house.  I sat by Darby for a while talking to her,
and then by Athena, girlfriend of Ben who works at Wende's work.  She
was pretty quiet; it was her first time to meet this group.  She has a
very cute nose and face.</p>

<p>People brought all kinds of food and cake and Melissa brought
tamales from San Antonio that were quite a hit.</p>

<p>At the end of the evening, I showed Rob the ceiling fan game called
"stay lined up with one blade of the ceiling fan (as it turns)."  We
didn't play that much, but we did play a significant amount of "bounce
the ball out from the bottom of the stairwell."  That game is great
fun.</p>

<p>It was great for me to meet Wende's peeps away from work; I enjoyed
seeing them in a non-work atmosphere.</p>

<p>I think I'll have a crush on Melissa for a while.</p>

<p><hr/></p>

<p class="date">12:18AM Sunday 31 December 2000</p>

<p>Dammit!!</p>

<p>I just checked me email and they played Ultimate tonight at UH.
The reason I'm upset is that I said I would play, and only 7 people
confirmed, so they just <em>barely</em> had enough people to play.  I
really hope they got to play and didn't miss me.</p>

<p>I forgot all about it as we hosted the party.  DOH!!</p>

                        <p><title>State of My Life Address 30 December 2000</title>
<p class=date>8:35am CST Saturday 30 December 2000</p>
<p class=note>(partially transcribed out of my diary)</p></p>

<p>I cannot believe how long it's been since I've written!!!  I'm so
totally sorry to have neglected you.</p>

<p>ACTUALLY I'm just kiddin'.  I've been writing on my website
www.robnugen.com.  The truth is that I've basically entirely switched
over to writing online instead of physically writing in here.</p>

<h3>STATE OF MY LIFE ADDRESS 30 DEC 2000</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>I'm not that amazed with the new year.  After the zeroes rolled
over the yeardometer, nothing can really top that.  Maybe 2222 but
probably not even that.  I will live that long, you know.  That's why
and because I'm learning new stuff all the time.</p></li>

<li><p>I can ride a unicycle!  Basically I learned in one year.  Now I
can ride up humps and down curbs.  I can't go up curbs yet nor jump
over anything, but I'll keep practicing.  Actually I haven't tried to
jump.  Maybe I will today.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm at the laundry mat now washing (actually drying (actually
watching the dryer spin as it apparently dries)) ANYWAY I'm washing
the comforter.  It was still relatively covered in cat hair when I got
it out of the big washer.</p></li>

<li><p>Wende and I are about to start "marriage" (we're not married
yet) counseling.  She's been not feeling horny and I've been unable to
not feel horny it seems.  That's one bottom line dynamic.  Also she's
been working a ton to keep the house clean while I have not as much
even though she is at work more than me (even though I think she
doesn't have to be)</p></li>

<li><p>I've written a cool generic model at work - actually 2
different ones.</p>

<ol type=I>
<li><p>One is geared toward 360 Feedback surveys: ("I" rate myself and
am rated by peers, direct reports, managers.  then "I" get a compiled
report of ratings, then try to improve on these areas that apparently
need improvement.  This model requires "me" to request feedback from
certain people who may or may not be in our dataset (add them if not)
and they get emails sent to them with unique username & password.
They log in to our site, have to change their password, and then
provide feedback for "me" or others like "me" who have requested their
feedback.</p>

<p>So I've made a generic version of this model that uses</p>

<pre>
username dataset:
<em>userid</em> | name | email | class | etc

ratings dataset:
<em>userid</em> | may rate userid | responses | etc

question dataset:
text | anchortype

anchor dataset:
<em>anchor type</em> | text | value

OH! and class dataset:
<em>classnum</em> when-to-send-emails | etc
</pre>

<p>I'm almost to the point where I can specify several variables at
the beginning (or have a new DS that defines them... Oh my God I just
figured something...</p>

<p>Overview dataset:</p>

<pre>
<em>project name</em> | title | program 1 | program 2 | program 3
</pre>

<p>and if there had to be something So Different about a project then
I could specify different code for that project's program 3, for
example.  Wow.  I may do this.)
</p></li>

<p><hr align="left" width="33%"> <center>Back to SOML</center> <hr
align="right" width="33%"></p>

<li><p>The other generic is an occupational health survey.  It uses
only 1 program to print all the different pages of the survey and
encoded into the question dataset is how to present the
questions.</p></li>
</ol>
</li></ul>

<p>The comforter is dry.  I'm going back home and I'll finish this
online & paste it in here.</p>

<p class="date">10:19am</p>

<p>As I typed the stuff above, I recognized how much faster I type
than I write.  Therefore it seems to me that it must be the case that
I have far more entries now that I'm writing them online than I would
have if I still wrote them on paper.</p>

<p>continuing with SOML Address:</p>

<p><ul>
<li><p>I have not yet met Jerry, who also rides a unicycle.  I have
virtually met him online - we have exchanged emails and might go ride
later today at Herman Park</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>I have just recently signed both Wende and I up to take a
quickie free spanish class on 9 January 2001.  At that class, I will
ask the instructor what level of class I should take next.  I&rsquo;m going
to learn spanish this year.</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>The Houston Rally is coming soon.  I have a concern about the
enforcement of our NO WALK-INs policy.  It will really suck to have to
turn people away if they don&rsquo;t pre-register.  But I think that after
the craziness at San Antonio (25 walk-ins), and the subsequent meeting
with YAC, people won&rsquo;t do it.  For those YRUUers reading this who need
to register, visit the website <a
href="https://swd.yruu.org">website</a> and click on Upcoming Events
(or the big link at the top of the page)</p></p>

<p>I am officially in charge of this rally, but I have done relatively very
little work to make it happen.  Delegation and Youth Empowerment have
made this easy!  Not everything has been exactly as *I* would have
done it, but that's to be expected.</p>

<p>Big jobs that I haven't done:</p>

<ol>
<li>Registration.  Katherine is registrar.</li>
<li>buying the T-shirts.  JoAnne did that</li>
</ol>

<p>I have a concern that registration and touch groups will be wacky,
but I trust that the youth can achieve more amazing things than I
could ever do.</p>

<p>Another big job that hasn't been done yet is ordering food.  The
youth are doing something new for food stuff this year; we will see
how it's working out on 7 January, our next meeting.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been writing relatively lots of letters (snail mail)
lately.  To receive good snail mail I write good snail mail.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't shut down the Feel Good Net mailing list, but I also
haven't sent a message to it in a long time.  I think I'll send a
final message and close the list.  Maybe today.</p></li>

<li><p>I have offered up the Ringmaster position of The Webring For
People Named Rob, and one Rob said he was interested, and I told him
what he needed to do, but he hasn't done it.</p></li>

<li><p>My dad has ordered a new 45Gig hard drive and is therefore
giving me his old 13Gig hard drive as a gift!  I remember when Tammy
and I spent $300 on a 143Meg hard drive.  This 13Gig hard drive is
essentially 13 thousand Megs, almost 100 times the capacity of the
$300 drive back in 1992 or so.  Amazing.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm considering thoroughly updating the code that displays my
journal entries.  I want to rewrite it so that the <em>prev :
next</em> links work over the month and year boundaries.  Also so that
one can select prev or next month from the index on the left.  That
will be cool.</p>

<p>I might also write a shockwave version.</p>

<p>I'm imagining the link on the front of my site linking to a page
that offers HTML Version or Shockwave version, and a checkbox that
says "Remember this choice" which will write a cookie to the user's
machine so that they just go to the correct version next time. That
will be way cool.</p></li>

<li><p>Tomorrow night I will join the youth group in staffing a
concession stand at a fireworks extravaganza in The Woodlands.  The
group will be paid $36 per hour.  We hope to have more than 6 people
there so we can share the work and play and have a grand ol'
time.</p></li>

<li><p>emacs is working on removing the nineteenth ring (again).  This
is where I accidentally stopped it last time.</p></li>

<p class=date>4:01pm CST Saturday 30 December 2000</p></p>

<p>My legs have that wonderfully exercised tired feeling.  In the past
3 hours I watched a couple episodes of Futurama (on tape) while
rotating the wheels on my skates.  Then I tried to print my
journal.cgi file so I can tweak it, but then remembered our printer
needs a new ink cartridge.  Since I had newly rotated skates, I
decided to skate down to Office Max and get a new cartridge.  I had $7
cash.  Certainly that would be enough.</p>

<p>Push push push skate skate skate, feeling that speedy gliding
feeling over street and curb, easing through stop signed intersection,
cautiously approaching then sprinting across 4 lane street, down
another street into the parking lot, weaving around cars and people
and easing into Office Max.</p>

<p>The printer cartridge was $7.99 plus tax.</p>

<p>Back across the parking lot, down the street, across the other
street, down the street, into the garage, thumpy thumpy up the stairs,
grab some coins out of my 5 gallon glass coin jar, thumpy thumpy down
the stairs, down the street, etc, etc and bought the cartridge and etc
etc back to the house.</p>

<p>I printed journal.cgi and it was 2:40pm.  I had a tentative meeting
plan with Jerry at 3pm at Herman Park.  He had suggested the idea, and
I agreed, but he never wrote back.  So I told him I'd just be there at
3pm and he can come uni if he wanted.</p>

<p>3pm at Herman Park on my (borrowed) unicycle.  I never found Jerry,
but I had a few great successes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I unied along a thin section of sidewalk (about 7 inches wide)
for about 20 feet</p></li>

<li><p>I unied up both side of the paved sidewalk of the hill at
Miller Outdoor Ampitheater</p></li>

<li><p>I unied down the back (bumpy, grassy) side of the hill at
Miller Outdoor Ampitheater</p></li>

<li><p>I unied half way up the bumpy grassy side of the hill about 5
times</p></li>

<li><p>I unied three-quarters of the way up the bumpy grassy side of
the hill once.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And at the end of all that, I determined that the bearings on the
wheel are almost shot, cause they squeak when they turn, and they
don't turn perfectly easily.</p>

<p>The uni is about 35 or 40 years old; I know it's a Schwinn, but I
don't know if I'll be able to find parts for it.  But I do know one
way to find out.</p>
