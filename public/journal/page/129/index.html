<p>&ldquo;Today&rdquo; I spent about 5 hours working on a rewrite of some code that
worked back when there were 40k records, but isn&rsquo;t quite as good with
90k records.  Not a huge difference, but I&rsquo;m hoping to make the number
of records not matter any more.</p>

<p>Also sorted out the details for a new shirt coming soon to a TV near
anyone who watches a lot of TV in Japan.</p>

<p>Also found out that my Magination magnets should arrive in about a
week or so</p>

<p>Also watched Midnight in Paris (nice movie), and two episodes of Rick
and Morty on Netflix.</p>

<p>Also meditated for an hour, and mighttttt do it again tomorrow, but I
think I&rsquo;ve stayed up too late to do it and feel okay with how much
work I&rsquo;ll get done.</p>

<p>Also watched a couple videos of Dr Greer speaking; it was actually his
videos that prompted me to meditate.</p>

<p>HI Travis!</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestion!  It&rsquo;s quite great!</p>

<p>In fact, it does everything I thought I would need&hellip;  BUT, it doesn&rsquo;t
let me see the images so I can rename them before moving them to the
server.</p>

<p>It solves a big problem though, because for some reason, OS X won&rsquo;t
notice my phone when I plug it in to my machine.  (Thanks Apple!)</p>

<p>So at least I can use termux to just bulk upload all my images from my
phone to a server, pull them down to my machine, rename and put them
in subdirs based on their content, and re-upload!  Yayaayyyyy that
.. well, that leaves a lot of room for improvement!  ;-)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still doing iOS development which keeps me tied to this hardware,
at least for that purpose.  But this machine has gone out of style
even by Apple standards, so maybe it&rsquo;s time to upgrade to
&hellip;. something fancy!</p>

<p>I visited this question about a year ago (more?)..  Maybe I&rsquo;ll start
looking again.</p>

<p>Yesterday I joined <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/sogotko">SOGO</a> for their late start after Halloween partying
the night before!  I chatted with Emi who said she had <em>not</em> been
partying; in fact had been working the previous night.  Her company
does mobile payments, apparently using an app instead of hardware like
square.  Seems like more trouble for the end user, but maybe I&rsquo;m
misunderstanding.</p>

<p>The workout was fun; I&rsquo;m sorta kinda getting better strength and
endurance.  Mike was a bit puffed (thanks Jennie J for that word!),
which is unusual (exept after party night!)</p>

<p>I joined the &ldquo;advanced / super advanced / Menya&rdquo; group, whereas I had
joined the &ldquo;beginner / intermediate&rdquo; group before.  Wasn&rsquo;t too hard;
I&rsquo;ll stick with that plan from now on.</p>

<p>Lesson with A this morning was good; one-to-one because C is out of
town.  Not sure about K.</p>

<p>Lessons with guides today were fine.  Six back-to-back lessons in 3
hours about fun sciency topics.</p>

<p>Lesson with GG was great; we played an &ldquo;a / the&rdquo; game using coins.  Y
got a bit confused and I was suprised about that.  I think it might
have been because M seems to have fibbed, but I let it go.  If I&rsquo;m
correct about what happened, the core problem is that the lesson
content was too difficult.  Bad teacher.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m in Akihabara for my Thursday evening lesson, but some people are
still in a meeting in the room where the lesson is usually held.  One
of the other students is here, so I imagine we will get to kick them
out soon.</p>

<p>Because of my sweet drink, she asked if I like sweets / sweet drinks.</p>

<p>I started to explain the difference between the sweet adjective and
sweets as nouns.  She asked if it was the same as &ldquo;suite room.&rdquo;  Nope;
suite is a noun.</p>

<p>My slow walk to station time takes 25 minutes</p>

<p>Sub times:</p>

<ul>
<li>3:00 from house to first light</li>
<li>4:00 from light to top of valley</li>
<li>5:00 from top of valley to next light</li>
<li>4:00 from light after valley</li>
<li>3:30 valley light to vending and pokestop</li>
<li>2:00 from last traffic light to last light</li>
<li>3:30 from last light to platform</li>
</ul>

<p>Given these intervals, if I&rsquo;m late leaving for the station, I only
need to catch up to one of these points and I know I can walk slowly again.</p>

<p>Maybe I should make this a state of my life address; I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s
been over a month since the last one</p>

<ol>
<li>I&rsquo;ve staffed twice in Perth (Oct 2015 and Oct 2016), and three
times total for MKP NWTAs.</li>
<li>I recently got my permanent residency visa so I can leave Japan and
come back without much consideration</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m working on an app for iOS in Swift, based on
<a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/129904/create-breakout-game-sprite-kit-swift-part-2">breakout game</a></li>
<li>I&rsquo;m working on an app for Android in Java, based on a Hello World,
with the hopes that I can get <code>scp</code> working with ssh keys to send
images to my website</li>
<li>I haven&rsquo;t taken any Japanese lessons for a while due to lack of
funding, but I just recently reconnected to my US bank so I can
send money over.</li>
<li>Last night I waited at the door for an hour, excited for my
<a href="https://www.maginationgame.com">Magination</a> set to arrive, but it
was a different piece of mail.</li>
<li>Lin has been working crazy long hours, but she may change that
soon.</li>
<li>We have one cat (Jennie), who is about 5 years old (I think Lin
said)</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been studying kanji with JA Sensei on Android</li>
<li>My phone is a waterproof Android AQUOS by Sharp.  I still have my
iPhone 4 to use iMessage at times, but that&rsquo;s being phased out</li>
<li>After my lesson today I plan to exchange business cards with the
Japanese teacher who teaches in the next room during the same
timeslot.  She wants to do language exchange.  If we do that, I
want to be extremely clear about who&rsquo;s teaching whom at a given
moment.  (Why do I care so much?)</li>
<li>My room is still a mess since we moved in in June.  It makes Lin
crazy, but it makes me crazy to throw stuff away.</li>
<li>I haven&rsquo;t touched my art in months.  Part of me wants to toss
it&hellip; maybe I should keep drawing and pass them out as free
advertising.  No idea what&rsquo;s &ldquo;best&rdquo;</li>
<li>Lin and I are considering going to Niigata for New Year&rsquo;s holiday,
leaving and arriving exactly on the busiest days.  Apparently
tickets sell out quickly when they go on sale at 10am 30 days
ahead of time.  Both for buses and trains.  Tickets to Kyoto sell
out even more quickly.  I certainly don&rsquo;t want to drive (and chill
in traffic), but I don&rsquo;t want to stand on a train, either.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m on the train headed home after a lesson in which we created
presentations about Kirobo, a new entry in the personal assistant
space, this time by Toyota.</li>
<li>I just had to hard-reboot my phone because it was being a jerk.</li>
<li>Lin and I live in Shin Yurigaoka, in our all-electric house,
featuring IH stove and water heaters.</li>
<li>Fred is closer to being Dr Fred than before he bought tix to ACL
which were largely unused.</li>

<p>Now You See Me caught my eye on Netflix and I quite enjoyed it.  There
were a couple of minor <em>yeah right</em> points (besides all of them), but
generally it&rsquo;s good.</p>
