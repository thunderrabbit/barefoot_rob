<pre><code>I'm using my Debian box now, wirelessly (thanks to you), using a dual 
monitor setup (thanks to Debian maintainers), and have gotten several 
things working well, almost including the ability to make changes for 
work while my other machine is in the shop.  You suggested that I can 
reinstall Debian when I get my next PC, but is there some way to save 
time reinstalling all the junk on a new Debian install?  If not, then 
perhaps I can just update the kernel and keep this same hard drive in 
the new machine.  Speaking of which, I looked for Dell laptops in the 
Akihabara area, but didn't find anyone who can help me get an English 
keyboard and a blank hard drive.  I may come to the next TLUG meeting 
to see what's people suggest.  Or, might just just order straight off 
Dell's site. Okay, not sure how much longer I can keep up this margin 
alignment, so I'll find some way to end things so it lines up nicely.

<p>I&rsquo;m about an hour early; I&rsquo;m going to look at laptops to see what I
can see.  I should prolly also jump on TLUG list or go to a meeting
before buying anything&hellip;</p>

<h2 id="18-15">18:15</h2>

<p>I wandered around a bit and couldn&rsquo;t find anything good in any of the
smaller shops.  Even when I found things that seemed basically good,
they had Japanese keyboards, which aren&rsquo;t good for me.</p>

<p>Went to a couple big box stores.  One said they don&rsquo;t sell machines
without an OS installed.  The other one said come back later (I
think), and I might.  But not tonight.</p>

<h2 id="20-00">20:00</h2>

<p>The lesson was great, as usual.  GG are just so positive, inquisitive,
thoughtful, and lovely!</p>

<p>They had a meeting afterward, so we didn&rsquo;t walk to the station
together.  That worked out well; I had planned to tell them I was
going to go to 80s Cafe.</p>

<p>I went to 80s Cafe for the English lesson there.  It was a much
smaller group than the Japanese lessons, but still the same kinda
format: one instructor and students.  I seemed to be the only native
English speaker on the student side of things.</p>

<p>After the lesson ended at 9, everyone promptly left, and Wada-san and
I chatted about junk, arriving at cheesemaking as my next plan.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to read them yet, but after I was just telling
Mutsumi that the weather cannot get hot enough for me, she showed me
kanji above the train door which mean &ldquo;this car doesn&rsquo;t have the AC on
full blast.&rdquo;  Apparently, it doesn&rsquo;t have the AC (compressor) on at
all!  Just fans, and I love it.</p>

<p>The kanji are written above the doors on car 4 of this Yamanote Line
train.  I&rsquo;ll keep a lookout for them and head to those cars whenever
possible.  Woohoo!!</p>

<p>On my way down Takeshita street, I heard my name, looked up and saw
Doan from Japanese class!  Neat!  He had just been studying and was
looking for a bite to eat so we went to King Kebab on that street.
Kebab munchin&rsquo; we headed to the toy store to check out the goods!</p>

<p>We played with a marble track thing which has about a 70% success
rate, which I guess is pretty good for being made of building
blocks..  I hadn&rsquo;t tried to make things with it before, but did so
today with Doan.</p>

<p>Mai helped us a bit, as we weren&rsquo;t familiar with the available pieces
or how they were designed to go together (normally I&rsquo;d shun any help
in favor of exploration, but in the interest of time, it certainly
helped!)  We made a relatively significant change to the overall
structure, allowing two previously too-close tracks be connected with
a stack of long tracks.</p>

<p>This was the night two women who spoke Chinese and English came in to
buy some stuff and asked why their wifi device wasn&rsquo;t working.  We
directed them to a shop in the area for their cell provider.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a packrat; I&rsquo;ve got a bunch of junk strewn across robnugen.com,
and I&rsquo;m lazy.  I will probably never finish moving everything to
www.robnugen.com (via new.robnugen.com), so 80% likely the subdomains
of robnugen.com will linger much longer.</p>

<p>I mention this because I just scanned a couple entries at vihart.com.
The site is clean and lovely, and though I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s been
pruned, it&rsquo;s at least had some design thought put into it.</p>

<p>This pruning idea is something that almost never happens on my
domains.  I&rsquo;ve got a crappy image called attr3.gif on my images root
directory.  I have no idea what it is, but it&rsquo;s only 1.4kb so what&rsquo;s
the big problem?  What if it&rsquo;s referenced by some amazing journal
entry I wrote?</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a way I could check that, of course, and that is to finish
moving all my journal entries from there to here and then do a search.
But that would require overcoming the lazy/busy aspect of things.</p>

<p>Then, there&rsquo;s a file called crap1.6meg.JPG, which, amazingly, is only
426kb.  How did that happen?  What&rsquo;s in the file?  Again, I don&rsquo;t
know, but it&rsquo;s there.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d love to reorganize my image folder directory structure, but that
would break myriad links.. but which ones?  where are they?  What
about people on other sites who have linked them?  If I move the
images, how do I set up a redirect to fix the broken links?  Should I
make a .htaccess file 5000 lines long?  Doesn&rsquo;t seem to fun for the
web server (or the web maintainer, whoever that is (ahem)), but maybe
it would be fine.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s my point?</p>

<p>nothing. nothing at all.  but this entry is staying right here (in a
permalink way, not in a stickied way).</p>
