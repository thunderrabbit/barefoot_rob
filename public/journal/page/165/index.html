<p class="dream">I bought a neat game and asked Lin if she'd like to
play.  She was like, "I don't like games" or something and I got
pissed off like "you haven't even seen what game I'm talking about!"
and I got it out to start playing with it, but couldn't find it in my
backpack due to all the other crap that was in there, including a
cooler full of watermelon and spinach which had apparently gone bad
because I didn't remember having put it in there, and some bread type
sweets, so I started throwing all of them out of my bag, and noticed I
couldn't really stop though I knew it was infantile, and lots of
people were nearby so I wasn't making a very good example of emotional
awareness.</p>

<p class="dream">
Fred came to Japan  and I helped him unload his car while teling him
about the things I had been thinking about which included how to make
some computer programs, or wondering how to make some computer
programs to do some type of calculations.  Like how to write news
article titles based on news articles; we'd have a function
`title.txt()` for the  article thatwould calculate the article
</p>

<p class="dream">
We went into the house and Fred realized that he had left his car
unlocked and I was like, "I'll go lock it, and then he realized he can
just beep it from here because it was not too far outide the bedroom
winodw.  He locked it, and it unlocked.  Oh he had locked it, so he
beeped it again and locked it.
</p>

<p class="dream">
Then he unlocked it and said watch.  If I don't come with proxxximity
of the car, it will relock itself.  It took a while and I started to
get sleepy so I got, just relock it I'm falling asleep, but I get the
idea.
</p>

<p>At this piont I kinda woke up because I realized I was dreaming.</p>

<p class="dream">
In a vaguey lucid state, there were some tough guys in front of the
conveni when we went to go inside, but I wasn't worried because I knew
it was a dream, and one of them dropped their cell phone as the other
handed it to him and I saw a cell phone commercial on the billbord and
they graphically showed the guys of the phone being swapped for a
different body, and I was like, "ah; I want that" so I kept watching
until the brand / maker was displayed and then they showed it being
used inside a shoe a la Get Smart, and a guy used the shoe phone and
sudently got a phone call from the Get Smart actor who said he called
because he was excited to promote the in-shoe phone technology.
</p>

<p class="dream">
I wondered how long he'd be calling people and wouldn't the
converaations get pretty boring so I better think of something
intersting to say when he called me after I bougth the phone.

<p>Good last lesson of the year with GG, featuring only M and Te because
Y had to leave for a 忘年会 (end of year party).</p>

<p>Actually M was quite late, but she brought back the Digits in a Box
puzzle, which I think I&rsquo;ve written about before.  She wasn&rsquo;t able to
solve it without looking it up online.  I plan to give it to Fred not
just unsolved, but without the containing box, so he won&rsquo;t immediately
know how small it can be made.</p>

<p>Met a new student who would like to practice presentations for his new
business.  When I heard that, I remembered all the times I&rsquo;ve heard
that before, and all the times the students have quickly given
up. (80% ?)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to think it&rsquo;s not completely my fault, but in any case, I
have a good feeling about this particular person, except that he seems
to have a pretty busy schedule, and would like to have lessons on an
ad hoc basis, which I can imagine may become less and less frequent.</p>

<p>But anyway, his project sounds really neat!  He&rsquo;s not presenting a
bunch of boring numbers, but a bunch of exciting ideas, and I look
forward to helping him succeed in this new business endeavor.</p>

<p>We might even go on road trips to see the site.</p>

<p>I group went a little long due to a long 2nd round process for a man
who was late to the group after having committed specifically to being
on time.</p>

<p>I felt anger and realized it stemmed from my desire to be prepared and
my desire to procrastinate, which often conflict inside me.</p>
