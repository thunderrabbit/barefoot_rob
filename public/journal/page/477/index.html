<p>I'm at Kinko's again now, sitting by Chris and Wisam.  Chris is
from Cleveland, has no job, just got here three days ago.  "I'm just
hoping that something picks up really quickly, or else I'm gonna try
to pick up some day work."</p>

<p>Wisam used to work at Kinko's, is also from Cleveland, and is
working now at Ritz Camera.</p>

<p>Student at Bodie college in Maine, London next semester at
University of London he thinks.  Then Capetown South Africa next
year!  Wow!!!</p>

<p class=date>1:06am</p>

<p>I have just returned from Yoga with Catherine.  She listened to my
anxiety about my upcoming adventure, checked her address book for
people who might need an apartment.  I did yoga, about 4 or 5
positions.  Then she gave me some of her Indian food dinner.</p>

<p>We traded brief life histories.  In the time that I've known her,
we've never really talked except maybe one other time.  I enjoy
getting to know her better.</p>

<p>I told her of the huge dichotomy between the Wreckshop Records
people I met tonight after Swa'vet invited me to their gathering,
versus Chris & Wisam, the next two people I met.  Seems to be a huge
personality difference.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Alright, shit this is my website I'll write the non PC version.  I
met these thugs and gangstas many of whom were wearing gold chains and
smoking swisher sweets (?) and all those with whom I interacted were
quite polite, and quite testosterone filled.  It was a fantastic role
reversal for me to be briefly immersed in a black culture.  After a
while, one of the guys shook my hand and said it was great to meet me
but they were going to have a private meeting and therefore asked me
to leave.  No problem.  This allowed an easy way for me to make my
exit gracefully and not just leave out of boredom or fear or
whatever.</p>

<p>Then I got to Kinko's and see two black guys and they were so
funny, so soft spoken, so flirty..  Life completely threw a curveball
at me this evening.  Thank you, universe, for the lesson in dichotomy
and don't judge a book by its cover!</p>

<p>I'm at Kinko's and the people beside me are trying to fish out the
little metal tab from a 3.5" floppy that ripped off the disk in the
drive.  The laptop is still on.  Ah, now the floppy drive itself has
been removed from the laptop.  Good progress.</p>

<p class=date>8:38pm</p>

<p>Don't worry; they got it out.  But now the computer is
non-responsive, even to CTRL-ALT-DEL.  They are removing its battery
to reboot it.</p>

<p class=date>8:47pm</p>

<p>Back in action now.  They're working on some project. I gave them
my yellow adventure card.  They are working on "a little film thing"
but I haven't learned many details yet.  One guy (he who was
interested in insurance) was all, "bring a camera with you on your
trip.  It's as important as gas."  Man with tall hair added, "you
might meet someone along the way and never have a chance to see them
again."</p>

<p>Excellent points.  I believe I'll do that.  Hi-8, he suggests.
"Any manufacturer; they're all good now."  $250 at Best Buy.</p>

<p>It's a movie called <em>Dirty Third</em> I think.</p>

<p class=date>9:05pm</p>

<p>It's <em>Dirty Third II</em>, produced by Wreckshop Records (sp).
They begin filming on Monday.  Stephan is the insurance guy above.  He
suggested I get a dictation recorder as well.  And a
cigarette-lighter-to-AC plug.  Ah. very smart.</p>

<p>Turns out Steve was a surgeon until just over a year ago.  Amazing
lives we lead.  "Just remember," he suggests, "life is fun."</p>

<p class=date>9:57pm</p>

<p>Hanging with Steve, Junie, Swa'vet, who are putting together crew
passes for the filming.</p>

<p class=date>12:23am</p>

<p>Back home now.  Wow.  I helped Swa'vet get templates arranged to
make copies of security passes on orange and yellow paper.  Lots of
detailed cutting and pasting work.  I get my own Production Assistant
pass!  They didn't have my name typed, so my name is written in all
caps at the bottom of my pass.  ROB</p>

<p>John got pizza from Star Pizza, and I was invited to join them for
a medium sized deep dish eaten from the hood of John's car.  Minor
pizza spillage on the hood, but it seemed to get wiped up no
problem.</p>

<p>I've been invited to join them in their chill-out shoot-the-shit
room in their hotel for the next 3 nights.  Most excellent!</p>

                        <p class=date>8:11am CDT Tuesday 9 July 2002</p>

<p>I've got a pretty healthy list of things to do today.  Changing
addresses, progress on selling furniture, selling books, updating Kim
Sawyer's website, fix flat bike tire, verifying finances, planning
finances, emailing peeps, do laundry, etc.</p>

<p>Last night Andrea pointed out that I don't meet the financial
requirements to live here, so I'm going to flirt/negotiate with
Jill/Sylvia (respectively, as I've found that's how they best respond)
to see if they will force me out of here and not charge me for it.</p>

<p>Wish me luck.</p>

<p class=date>9:31am</p>

<p>I dropped off my laundry, talked to Sylvia in the office.  Told her
I was (*) in violation of my lease for not having a job.  She wasn't
phased by that, but pointed out that I had paid my lease through the
end of July so I was not in violation.</p>

<p>Short version of the discussion is that I gave them 30 days' notice
as of today, so I have to be out by 8 August.  I told them I will be
out by 20 July, and even sooner if someone wants to move in sooner.</p>

<p>It's apparent to me that Sylvia works by the rules, with no bending
of rules, etc.  Amazing how challenging it was to have her possibly
consider the possibility of having someone move in as a roommate if
they were someone coming in to look at apartments.</p>

<p>There is a guy interested in moving into a 1 bedroom apartment;
they will call him today and say mine is available soon.  I hope hope
hope they tell him I'll move out sooner than 20 July if that will
help.  That's what I told them to tell him.  I asked, but they
wouldn't let me call him of course; that would violate his
privacy.</p>

<p>Talked to Roy, who has been working here for twenty years.  He
agreed that it's not as fun to work here.  Sylvia makes a list
<em>every day</em> of things for him to do.  The list consists of
clean the pool, etc etc, which are all the things that Roy has already
been doing every day for the last 20 years.  Amazing.</p>

<p>I laughed my ass off when he showed me the list.  "She's reminding
you to clean the pool????????"</p>

<p>"Every day she reminds me."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Things are changin'.</p>

<p>(*) The star is when I showed Vida a map to get to The Guild Shop.
She had been in the laundry room and asked if I knew where it was.  I
drew her a map during which time she left to get quarters, and I
started to write before she got back.</p>

<p>We chatted a bit; she's retired, 66 years old now.  I gave her my
yellow adventure card, and I just now wrote her a postcard to begin
our snail correspondence.</p>

<p class=date>11:30am</p>

<p>Fantastic.  I got a call on my apartment the first morning that it
was in the paper.  I trust that I'll have it taken over on time
without a problem.</p>

<p class=date>11:46am</p>

<p>Wow.  Will (who called) is at the complex now, about to see inside
the apartment.  And I've been sitting at Kinko's the whole time.</p>

<p class=date>12:00pm</p>

<p>Aight; I'm done being at Kinko's for now.</p>

<p class=date>1:36pm</p>

<p>Have sold the great majority of my books to 1/4 Price Books for
$30.  I don't think I made quite $1/lb, but it was close.</p>

<p class=date>2:33pm</p>

<p>Have visited The Guild Shop, changed my address with them (they are
consigning some of my stuff), and confirmed a good time to drop off my
furniture so they can consign it as well.  Monday around noon.  I'll
use Dude's truck.  :-)  Thanks, Dude!</p>

<p class=date>3:23pm</p>

<p>Leaving Kinko's again.  I've finished most of my list of things to
do today.</p>

<p class=date>6:39pm</p>

<p>Chillin' at Border's bookstore for ASL, but no one else from my
class seems to be here.  Chuck, our instructor did say that he would
not be here, but the first time he told us this, some of the students
said they would come anyway.  No one said that explicitly last week,
but it seems the answer is no.</p>

<p>But it's all good; I got to see a few years ago friend Bryce, who
was a friend of Jon W-L, and who attended YRUU a couple times then. I
had seen Bryce around a few times and took a while to remember his
name those times, but I finally got it down.  But today he had a bit
of facial hair, and I was mostly at a loss, but he reminded me.
Awesome!  He's planning to be a smoke jumper as his next job/adventure
cause he's not afraid of fire and thinks it would be a pretty cool
job. I gave him my card and invited him to write me updates.</p>

<p>That was at Whole Foods where I purchased a Mango Go Go smoothie
from Jamba Juice.  While in line to pay, I gave the cashier my
apartment-for-lease card, and gave one to the woman in line behind
me.  She said she did know of someone - her roommate's boyfriend.
Excellent!</p>

<p>On the way out I said bye to Bryce and then gave a guy a quarter
who was asking for change, but I wasn't 100% loving and said, "you
know, I don't have a job; do you have a job for me?"  He didn't, and I
wished him a good day.</p>

<p>Across the street to Border's and met Doug who was staffing another
Green Mountain Energy table (that's what Bryce was doing at Whole
Foods) and I talked to him a bit, but I think I bored him with my
story of how I got my U2 Pop Mart concert T-shirt even though I gave
the fast version after he asked about my shirt.  Oh well.</p>

<p>I'm sitting in the outdoor part of Border's Cafe to hide my Outside
Food Or Drink, which is explicitly prohibited by a sign on the door.
I like the Jamba Juice smoothies more than Border's.</p>

<p>Hung out at Amy's house while she whipped together some design
concepts for Kim Sawyer's websites.  I was quite impressed with her
agility in photoshop.  "I feel like my grandmother watching me on the
computer."</p>

<p>"If it makes you feel any better, I did go to school for this."</p>

<p>Actually, that does help.</p>

<p>She pulled together a concept for my site as well.  I think I can
easily put an image here.</p>

<p>I'm exploring different ways to advertise the availability of my
apartment.  I've advertised via my website, telling my friends,
Houston Press, Houston Chronicle, and just today I made some two sided
business cards to hand out to people.  These are on light blue paper
instead of yellow like my Adventure business cards.</p>

<p>They'll be ready by 3pm today.</p>

<p>I went to Whataburger to check in with the manager who does the
hiring.  He interrupted me soon after I said, "I turned in an
application yesterday..."</p>

<p>At first I thought he was just going to say, "Tuesday is my hiring
day," which is what the employees had said yesterday.  But he said
something like, "I'm not even talking to anyone now; I'm going on
vacation tomorrow, so come back in two weeks."</p>

<p>I love the irony.  In two weeks, I intend to be out of here.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>In another ironic twist, I got a call from Nate, who was one of the
first people I called right after I lost my job.  He apologized for
not having called back sooner.  I told him my availability had changed
since no one called me back...  He'll keep my resume on file in case
he gets a contract that can be finished before I leave.</p>

<p>Tonight during I-group, my friendship ring broke.  That's one of
the rings that Bryn and I traded at Plano Rally.  I intend to give her
part of it and me keep part of it.</p>

<p>The ring had gotten bent and I was trying to bend it back into
shape.  The weak metal couldn't stand all that bendin'.</p>

<p>Also during I-group, we welcomed Tom back into the group after he
had checked out for some months to finish a different personal growth
program.  I enjoyed hearing his stories and describing the
similarities and differences between I-group and the other.</p>

<p>He told us another story that he experienced while driving past the
construction on 59 near Shepherd.  He saw a guy inspecting the
construction site and saw it was me!  He confirmed this by noting that
I wore no shoes.... "that's Rob" was his final passing thought.  Nice.</p>

<p>After I-group, I gave some cards to Andrea, my
ex-next-door-downstairs neighbor who moved down the hall from where
she used to live.  She reminded me that by the rules of the complex, I
can't live here anymore since I make less than 3.5 times my monthly
rent.  Whoohoooo!!  I'll talk to them tomorrow.</p>

<p>I'm sitting across the street from 1/4 Price Books.  Traffic flows
down Shepherd.  Business suits and t-shirts and shirts with collars,
and just now a cowboy hat, a taxi, a Fire Extinguisher van, a goatee
in a truck, another collar shirt, ballcap driving a truck, and too
many to mention them all.</p>

<p>Mostly male drivers by a significant margin.  26 male and 7 female
in the most recent batch of cars.</p>

<p>In 22 minutes, 1/4 Price Book will open, and I'll offer my books to
Larry to see if he can sell them.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Larry arrived 30 minutes late, and he put up a sign that said he'll
open at noon tomorrow.  I talked to him a bit as he was writing the
signs.  He said he had been working on a big project and just needed
to take a rest.</p>

<p>I wonder what was the big project??</p>

<p>I blessed his choice to take a day off.  I'll see him tomorrow
around noon probably.</p>

<p>Chillin' at Dude and Veronica's house now, after Wende and I
watched Men In Black 2.  Movie was pretty good, but I don't know if
better than the first one.  Certainly as good as the first.</p>

<p>Funniest parts were when Jay (Will Smith) was neuralizing the
witnesses.  A couple of them were funny.</p>

<p>Dude and I are IMing each other across the room talking about new
design for my front page.</p>

<p>We're such geeks.</p>

<p class=date>12:26am</p>

<p>Wow.  We've gotten a pretty cool design for my site.  I have a .jpg
for it so far.  It will take a while to implement, but I think it will
be quite fly once it's in place.  Super thanks to Dude for creating
the .jpg and pointing me to a site for concepts on how to do
calendars.</p>

<p>I've been working on a way to make my recent journal entries appear
on the front page of my site.  See <a
href="/cgi-local/index.pl">index.pl</a> for what I've got so far.
It's not particularly pretty, but it gets the job done.  I'll spruce
it up a bit (and try to figure out why the rollover doesn't seem to be
working on the "images" image) and then make it the default.</p>

<p>During this process, I noticed that I had effectively disabled my
older journal entries from before 2002.  That should be fixed now.</p>

<p>- - - - -</p>

<p>Also today I got a few steps further to getting my PayPal account
set up, and paid some bills, talked to Alvin a homeless guy who hangs
out around here, and other stuff.</p>

<p>Wende and I are going to see Men In Black II tonight.</p>

<p class=date>6:14pm</p>

<p>Oh, I remember what else I did.  I applied for a job at
Whataburger.  It looks like I'll probably get it.</p>

<p>I got to take a phat nap during the last two hours of my sale.
Dave was my one and only visitor.  I'm thankful for the success I had
today!</p>

<p>I opened an account this morning with a different bank (one with a
storefront), so I can get my paypal thing linked with them.  I'm going
to get online and do that now.</p>

<p>It's possible that I'll see a movie with Wende and Maggie today
_Men In Black 2_.  That is if they don't go see _Secrets of the YaYa
Sister Club_</p>
