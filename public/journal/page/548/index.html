<p>I've been awake for about 30 minutes;; I tried to
go back to sleep but it didn't work.</p>

<p class=note>(Early Dream)</p>

<p class=dream>With YRUU, camping out in  the woods
somewhere, I was in a building and was planning to go
outside  to jump on the trampoline, although the 
trampoline had some low  hanging tree branches over
it.  And I had something stuck in the back of my mouth
 in  my teeth.</p>

<p class=dream>Two non YRUU women were outside on a
different trampoline, but they were just sitting on it
and talking.</p>

<p class=note>recent  dream:</p>

<p class=dream>I was oferred a job with PBS
television, doing some computer stuff.   Looking
through the job descriptions,.. there were actually
two different jobs available, and they wanted me  to
fill one particular job more than the other particular
job, but I could still take either one.  I was reading
through the  descriptions when I woke up and had to
P.</p>

<p>- - - - -</p>

<p>Last  night  after work I visited with Travis and
Carolyn at the bookstore, looking at books on how to
learn Japanese.  According to Travis, there are
basically two ways to learn:</p>

<ol>
<li>start  with learning the  basic Kana (characters
that represent a sound  but  have no meaning) in two
different alphabets:  Hirikana and Katikana.   One of
these alphabets is used to spell out the sounds of
Japanese words, the other to spell foreign  words. 
Then learn  the Kanji, a character set whose
characters have both a sound and a meaning.  One must
know about 6000 kanji to be able to read a Japanese
newspaper.</li>

<li>Learn the sounds of Japanese words spelled out in
Romanji, which uses our alphabet to spell out  the
sounds of the Kana  and Kanji, and makes it easier to
learn spoken  Japanese quickly, but pretty much screws
up written Japanese skillz, and actually doesn't do
spoken Japanese perfectly because some of the Kana
require sounds that our alphabet just doesn't
have.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm  going to learn the Kana and not get  screwed
up with Romanji.</p>

<p>He suggested a book  series <em>Japanese for Busy
People</em> (published by Kadasha press I think). 
They have a Kana version and a 'revised version' that
has identical content but with Romanji added.</p>

<p>I will  have to get some sort of audio to go with
my books so I can make sure I'm pronouncing correctly.
 I will start with CDs and then maybe seek out some
peeps who also want to learn.  Or maybe someone who
knows Japanese and wants to learn English.</p>

<p class=note>dream</p>

<p>Downtown skating, and  tomorrow was the last day
athat Diane would  be in town so she and I could go
skating together.  I wanted to call her to confirm a
skate date with her.</p>

<p>I crossed the street  because I saw a very short
rollercoaster - a short version of Greezed Lightning
(a shuttle loop coaster for those who know what that
means) that was built between a building  and the
street surrounded by a wobbly chain link fence.</p>

<p>I leaned on the fence and asked the guy how much it
cost  to ride and he said it was free once I get
inside the fence, and that normally costs ten dollars.
 But  if I just  climbed over the fence that would be
okay too.</p>

<p>The train was running as we talked,  and though I 
couldn't hear it, I thought I would have to shout for
the guy to hear me.</p>

<p class=note>dream (all entered without keyboard,
which I left at work)</p>

<p class=dream>climbing mountain, more like rocky dome
like Enchanted Rock in Austim, except in my dream the
rock naturally eroded to something like ribs or
bleachers, with a level below the level we were
walking on.</p>

<p class=dream>I had actually come visit this area
with two girls, but I saw Dude there and was hanging
out with him. My girl-friends were leaving so I needed
to go with them, but I wasn't totally done explorng
the odd bleacher formation.</p>

<p class=dream>As I left  I realized I had been
calling Dude's new dog (who is named Remington in real
life) 'Bailey' (the name of Dude's older dog).  I
couldn't remember Remington's name, but I knew I
should know it. Dude jokingly told me some wrong names
but I knew they were not it.</p>

<p>GenXchange meeting went great - we are super likely
to have a new member starting next month - Jose's wife
Jennifer.  We interviewed her today, and just have to
vote unanymously yes to accept her.</p>

<p>The value of our valuation unit is up 70% from $10
when we started in  Feb 2000,  despite the tech 
crunch of last several months.</p>

<p>If you want to join our club, we are looking for a
few new members.  Visit genxchange.tripod.com.    Note
that we are still in our formative first two years;
there are still some rough spots in our literature and
processes, but we are diligently working to become a
smoothly operating club.</p>

<p>If  you are interested in joining, email me <a
href='mailto:thunderrabbitATcheerfulDOTcom'>thunderrabbit
at cheerful dot com</a>.</p>

<p>I need to invite  my old friend Heather, who I
haven't talked to in a while.  I'm a bit nervous about
inviting her because of the rougness I described
above.  I don't want her to evaluate  our club and
decide it's not good enough to join.  Ouch, I would
say, but this is still only all in my head until I
actually ask her!</p>

giving them a link here because of their funny funny
ad!</p>

<pre>
HI

I just saw your TV commercial advertising
that moms can get a million dollars if we
buy cards for them.  That's all fine, but
what I *really* liked about the commercial
was the ending:

Mom, coaching soccer or something (after
having won a million dollars):  "Great Game!
Let's go get pizza!"

Then for a single second, we see what could
be an ad for an airline, but it's actually
the punchline on your commercial:  an airplane
flying marked "AIR ITALY"

The mom is flying them to Italy for pizza!

What I most appreciate is that the commercial
appears to be finished, and then offers a
quick punchline to those who are paying
attention.  The punchline is not belabored;
it's quick and succinct.  Most excellent!!!

<p>Wow!</p>

<p>I got a new keyboard FedExed (FedEx is a verb) to
me today!  Wow!  It came with a letter that was
actually signed by Rachel who sent me the keyboard,
and(!), it came in a soft zippable case.</p>

<p>I excitedly opened it and discovered it was even a
lighter color than my jet black keyboard.  "oooh, how
exciting!"</p>

<p>Then I saw why: it's for a Palm Pilot and not
Handspring Visor.  I have a Handspring Visor, not Palm
Pilot.</p>

<p>Doh!</p>

<p>But now I have a cool case and I'll give the
keyboard to Steve when I see him at OKC Rally in
June!</p>

<p>I will thank Rachel, but is there any "nice" way of
saying, "thanks, but it's the wrong type of keyboard."
??  I'm open to suggestions on this.</p>

<p>I've just been speeding through google.com looking
for free sources of SSG information for analyzing the
quality of companies before we purchase stocks.  I
found a source and then I downloaded a free SSG
printer application, but it sucked so I deleted it.  I
have copied the SSG info to disk and will maybe be
able to use better software at home, but I didnt' have
much luck there either.</p>

<p>I think this is the only thing I'm lacking before
being ready for our investment club meeting
tonight.</p>

<p>I'm leaving now to meet Travis at the bookstore to
embark on my Japanese learning adventure.</p>

<p>Karla is talking to one of our clients about the
G3.  I like it when she promotes my superfly project.

<p>I'm actually still at work, though I left work
twice for lunch.  Both times with Wende.  I had my
therapy session this morning, and he said, among other
things, "journal your ass off."  Don't worry.  I will.
 I do.</p>

<p>So anyway, I went to lunch with Wende to tell her I
double booked myself - that whole NASA thing, and then
I went to lunch with her on <em>her</em> lunch break
at work.  We munched at James Coney Island.  We both
had a baked potato and vanilla milkshake.  I
<em>-&lt;! L O V E !&gt;-</em> their vanilla
milkshakes!</p>

<p>Back at work I got to meet Scott, one of our
clients as he left with Kevin and Karla for
dinner.</p>

<p>And, I just finished writing a custom report thing,
which was pretty much my programming goal today. 
Nice.</p>

<p>- - - - -</p>

<p>I just checked my messages and called Carrie back. 
She had called me around 7pm.  She said she was
helping someone unpack, and she said, "I'm so glad you
called me."  I was all, "You called me first, but I'm
glad to call you."  She paused, then said, "okay."</p>

<p>Hmmm.  Sounds to me like she was trying to make her
person *not* think that she had called me first.  In
the past, Carrie has chosen relationships that are
less than optimally beneficial for her
emotional/physical health.  I hope I am completely
misinterpreting what just happened.</p>

<p>Wacky bad situation when I had to tell Wende I had
double booked myself with 1) taking one of our work
clients to NASA, and 2) going with Wende and her
family to scope out plans etc for our wedding.</p>

<p>See, back several weeks ago, I was all, "yeah, I
can take Winnie to NASA," but I never told Wende and I
didn't think about it when Wende asked if I could go
with her to do wedding stuff.  I was all, "oh shit!"
when I realized my error.</p>

<p>Sucks because I had to let Wende down, and I hate
to do that.  I am really hoping the trip to NASA will
be fun fun fun and not a lame-ass boring load of shit,
especially after cancelling with Wende for it.</p>

<p>We'll find out next Saturday night.</p>
