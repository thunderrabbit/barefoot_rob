<p>Fuck.</p>

<p>I just wrote a journal entry and then it
mysteriously vanished from my editor and I don't know
how it vanished and I couldn't get it back.</p>

<p>The dumbest thing about it is that the entry was
all, "today has been going slower than I wanted, and I
keep getting sidetracked by email and reading journal
entries, except I'm not getting email and no one is
writing journal entries."</p>

<p>What a dumber way to make things even more slow
than to have to type a journal entry twice to get it
on my site once.</p>

<p>So the point is, "<em>Blah.</em>" and I'm looking
forward to OKC Rally, but am trying not to get lost in
the piles of happy memories from tons of past rallies.
 I enjoy YRUU at least as much as my awesome youth
do!</p>

<p>Then I was all, "oh my gosh!! It's Elise's
birthday!  Elise is one of my newfound step sisters. 
She's my dad's girlfriend's daughter.  But I don't
have her email address."</p>

<p>But I'm not going to write all that again just to
point out that I can't contact her easily.  Blah Blah
Blah.</p>

<p>So the only thing to do is get back to testing my
code and progress slowly and steadily, keeping track
of all the things to keep track of and shit like
that.</p>

<p>Bye.</p>

<p>Today in YRUU the group embraced the idea of
writing a movie!  How super duper incredibly great fun
this will be!!  Cassie took notes as we brainstormed
ideas.  I think I'll write some script ideas as well
during the week.</p>

<p>Yay big movie project!!!!</p>

<p>On the way home, I picked up the Slackware 7
distribution of linux from Maggie.  It's gonna take a
few extra brain cells for me to figure out how to make
the initial boot disk.  I might have it figured out
and just need to do it, but maybe not.</p>

<p>But first, I'm going to watch Futurama, ride my
bike to Wende's work, go to dinner with her. 
Bye!!</p>

<p class=date>9:01pm CDT Sunday 3 June 2001</p></p>

<p>Pretty tired, and Wende is really tired after our first bicycle
ride together.  We went basically from Montrose to the railroad tracks
that cross San Felipe kinda close to 610.  I fell once, while riding
without using my hands or feet (that didn't last too long), and I
didn't try anything quite so silly again.  I did ride without my hands
while standing up (not pedaling) and with only 1 hand while standing
and pedaling.  And I rode with both legs on one side of the bike, and
I did a sideways bunny hop up a curb to the left.  Didn't quite make
it while hopping to the right.</p>

<p>In all, a lovely ride together!</p>

<p>This morning Wende read snippets from her book
<em></em> by Gillian Roberts, which she stayed up late
last night to finish.  Great writing, and quite funny,
especially for a sleepy 1 AM brain reading it.</p>

<p>I got an email from Fred today!  (This in itself is
amazing)  Even more exciting is that he has chosen to
attend UT in Austin!  Wow!  Wende says "I'll believe
it when he moves in."  She's excited, too.</p>

So I got your phone message and your postcard from
Australia;
unfortunately, Stanford has sucked me up and I haven't
had the time to
stay in touch.  (Also, my messy room sucked up the
postcard until
recently.)  However, I am now officially asking you
about the
following:  

  duty free film
  skateboard park
  vegemite
  747 video display
  plastic money
  kangaroo fat
  Aussie rules

In other news (as you may have heard from Dad), I
decided not to
attend Ohio State after all, and am going to go to
UT-Austin next
year.  I haven't told Ma, yet; I guess I should do
that.  

Big Dan (my unicycle) is doing fine.  I haven't ridden
it in a while.
I took it to Columbus with me and showed it to Pete
'n' them.  At the
time I had gotten to the point where I could
(inconsistently) ride
about thirty feet before falling.  So pretty soon I'll
be just good
enough to be dangerous, as it were.  

Classes are going well, though it's now time to buckle
down and really
get to work--next week is dead week.  Between now and
the end of the
year I have two hard problem sets, two final project
papers, one Java
servlet bookstore to write, and one final exam.  Wish
me luck.  

Time to get bakc to work,

<p>Awesome.</p>

<p>I can tell he's preoccupied because he misspelled
"back."  (Will someone tell me why (if) it's correct
grammar to put the period inside the quotation marks,
even though now the quotation marks do not contain
what was written???)</p>

<p>KTRU was <em>great</em> fun tonight!  I pretty much haven't had so
much fun at KTRU in quite a long time.  First cool thing is that I got
a lot of calls.  Like 5 requests in the first 10 minutes.   Oh,
actually, the first cool thing was that Kristin was the DJ before me;
she was covering for Ben (I think is his name).  Kristin has the cutest
voice at KTRU, and she's pretty cute too.  And she got her hair cut
short.  :-)</p>

<p>Second cool thing was I got a lot of calls, and the third cool
thing is that Jonathan came up to the station to say HI and spin a
guest DJ song, remniscent of a few semesters ago when I came to his
show to spin one side of eight in a four record album of the kids'
audio book <em>The Bear That Wasn't</em>.  That was so much fun!</p>

<p>Fourth cool thing is that I just had a lotta fun spinning CDs and
records and all that DJ stuff.  Yay for being a DJ!</p>

<p>!AND! I am doubly super excited tonight that I just got my linux
machine back online after *so* *long* of not having connectivity.
Sucky thing is that I have not yet been able to get both my NT and
Linux machines online at the same time.</p>

<p>Special thanks to John for coming over to try and get Wende's
machine online, but it doesn't seem like it's going to happen.  Maggie
talked to Wende and convinced her that she should get a stable system
like Linux for her machine!  John is going to give us a copy of his
Slackware 7.0 linux distribution.  Super great!</p>

<p>Wende and I visited the STAR WARS exhibit at the Houston Museum of
Fine Arts with Maggie and John today.  What an amazing experience to
get small snippets from behind the scenes of such a movie that has
become a cultural landmark for so many people.  To get to see costumes
worn by Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill (not all at
the same time).. to learn that the sound of a Tie Fighter is a cross
between an elephant and a car driving by on a wet road... To see some
of the actual models filmed in the movie.  So imperfect and obviously
plastic, but so *detailed* all at once.  Wow. wow.</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>Oh!!!  I got Wende a present!  It's a glazed
pottery dry erase board for taking telephone messages!
 She saw it at Paint This! and wanted me to paint one,
so I did.  It's so cute!  But don't tell her what it
is; just tell her you <em>know</em> what it is.</p>

<p>I'll give it to her 21 June 2001 for our negative 1
year wedding anniversary!</p>

<p>Past two days have been full of programming
roadblocks - all kinds of weird problems have appeared
in the code I've been developing.  Two of these
required me to call in the Kevmeister, and he was
dumbfounded by both, and we found work-arounds for
both.</p>

<p>They were both part of G3 development: 1) was
calling a macro that had been superq'd:</p>

<pre>
%let dog = %superq(macroname);
%&dog;
</pre>

<p>The called macro would just fail at the first
apostrophe.  Very odd.</p>

<p>The other was for the response_rate screen, which
displays the response rate of people's feedback
providers and a legend that describes the color coding
used on the screen.  The legend wasn't being printed
correctly, and it was freaky because this code had
been working, *and* because we verified that the
correct string was being written to the browser.  Both
NN and IE broke in the same way.  So it must not have
been written correctly to the browser, but the string
was correct.  We verified that.</p>

<p>Bizarre, don't you think?  (Yes, so bizarre that I
know what the hell I'm talking about!)</p>

<p>Super fun night with Maggie, John, Molly, who all
came over to visit.  We ate at Star Pizza, the best
pizza in Houston, and had a wonderfully cute waitress,
Josephine (I think).  I gave her an extra dollar in
her tip for being so cute.</p>

<p>Back at home, the girls gossipped, while John
helped me hook up 2 computers to the cable modem,
using the DSL router as a hub.  So great!  I knew it
could be done, but I didn't know how.  Thanks to John
for knowing how!</p>

<p>Wende's Win 95 had to be reinstalled, but it won't
access the 'net yet.  I don't know why, but I'm too
tired to mess with it now.  Good night.</p>

<p>I rode my bike from home to work, from work to my
counseling session.  I was crazy hot and dripping
sweat when I arrived; it was tricky to write a letter
without getting sweat all over the page.  I was mostly
cool by the time my appointment started.</p>

<p>After my session, it was sprinkling a bit after a
rain and my ride to work was much cooler and somewhat
wetter.  Oh so great to have a bike!!!!</p>

<p>Today I plan to finish version 1.4 of the G3 Admin
site, and then convert to G3 the project of my
favorite client-contact, Kristin.  She is great!</p>
