<p><p>Wow!!</p>

<p><p>Wow!!</p>

<p><p>Super cool!!</p>

<p><p>On the way to work, I visited Kroger with the intention of purchasing a jar of jelly.  Walked in, arrived at the jelly aisle, grabbed strawberry jam, walked back toward the registers.</p>

<p><p>There was no line at the 15 Items Or Less register, but next to the register was something I had never seen before.</p>

<p><p>An automatic cashier thing!!  I scanned my Kroger Card, scanned the jam, and inserted a $5 bill into the slot.  Out popped two $1 bills, my change and receipt!</p>

<p><p>Wow!!!</p>

<p><p>I told Kevin at work, and he&rsquo;s all, &ldquo;yeah they had those over a month ago at my store.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class="dream">I was at work and there was a phone call for Kevin.  I almost
picked it up, thinking it was for me.  It was Christine!!  She was on
speaker phone and was all, &ldquo;Kevin, this is Christine and was just
calling to tell you blah blah blah &ldquo; and I was all freakin&rsquo; because
two reasons: 1) I really wanted to talk to her and 2) Her ex-boyfriend
happened to be at my work too, and I didn&rsquo;t want him to hear her on
the phone cause he really hates her.</p>

<p><p class="dream">I was looking for the HOLD button, but couldn&rsquo;t find it and she
just kept talking about me.. About how I was such a great friend and
had done all these cool things etc.  (Christine routinely promotes her
friends to other friends in her continuous networking between people)</p>

<p><p class="dream">I finally found the hold button and then picked up the phone again
so I could hear her, but her old b/f kept like trying to follow me
around, trying to listen as well.  I didn&rsquo;t dare say anything because
I didn&rsquo;t want him to know how happy I was to hear from her.</p>

<p><p class="dream">Finally Kevin picked up and was talking to her in the other room
and I wrote him an email to see if he could give me her number.</p>

<p><p class="dream">Kevin&rsquo;s computer was not on his desk, but on the floor as he was
making way for his new computer to come in..</p>

<p><p class="dream">I decided to email the request to Kevin, but as I was watching my
monitor, it turned into a TV showing an old Texas A&amp;M football game
against the Houston Oilers.  The game was classic because the field
was covered in 4 feet of water!  The scene showed the QB dropping
back to toss and he stumbles just as he throws the ball and it is not
caught, but neither is it down because the ball never touched the
ground.  An A&amp;M player thrashed away from Oiler defenders and got the
ball, swimming huge fast strokes, half running half modified butterfly
stroke.  He swam astonishingly fast (they all were) and made the
touchdown, winning the game.</p>

<p><p class="dream">My point of view had melted into the screen so I was <em>at</em> the game
and totally cheering for them/him.</p>

<p><p="dream">And then I was back at work, and something else and I woke up.</p>

<p><p>Last night Wende and I saw Mission: Impossible 2.  It was pretty
stuntful, but the plot was not astonishing, and some of the stunts did
not properly conserve physical momentum.</p>

<p><p>But too be sure, the stunts were really awesome. A couple of times
I could see the background on &ldquo;screen&rdquo; behind the actor, but not too
often, and I didn&rsquo;t let that ruin my movie experience.</p>

<p><p>My favorite scene was remniscent of Silence of the Lambs, but Wende
said she predicted it before the scene started.</p>

<p><p>Good movie for the stunts, but I give it a 1.25 thumbs up.</p>

<p><p>Here&rsquo;s a weird thing: I was offended by the sex scenes, which were
<em>not</em> that steamy, but just seemed so degrading toward women. (or to
the woman in the scene)..  I&rsquo;ve been reading a book called <em>Goddess
Sexuality</em> (or something like that) and I recognize how much our
society&rsquo;s patriarchy is smeared through everything.  There was no
other woman in the movie (not counting extras)..  It was all multi
zillion dollar businessmen, all grappling for money and power and the
holy grail, and using the girl as bait and a pawn.  There were some
asshole-ish references to &ldquo;all women lie and cheat&rdquo; etc.</p>

<p><p>Hmph. so I&rsquo;ll give the movie .75 thumbs up.</p>

<p><p>So I&rsquo;m working now on a project I&rsquo;ll call the DTRU Project (If I refer to the KTRU Project, it&rsquo;s probably a type-o).  DTRU Project is a subset of the Big Monster Project that I had been working on for months.</p>

<p><p>I have been commenting out huge sections of code that I think we will eventually need as the DTRU project experiences Feature Creep, but for now, it does not need.</p>

<p><p>Just a moment ago I tested some code, and even after all the commenting and changing and removing, including changing data set structures, <em>bing</em>, it worked.</p>

<p><p>I was literally surprised, &ldquo;oh my god!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I had expected not to be this far along for another hour or so.  I think that&rsquo;s worth a good unicycle break.</p>

                        <p><title>accident dream</title>
<p class=date>6:19am CDT Wednesday 14 June 2000</p></p>

<p><p class="dream">Walking along a road, making pretty good speed, Wende and I
came up to an accident.  The reporters were all on camera talking blah
blah blah about the accident and then a reporter saw my name on my
shirt and asked, &ldquo;Rob, how do you feel about this?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class="dream">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lived in this area for a really long time and have never
actually witnessed an accident so this is really emotional &hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class="dream">As I spoke, I was watching the workers with a big yellow truck
thing dig dirt and stuff out, when a something slipped, and like a
hamburger in a bun, a man got caught between two of the huge wheels.</p>

<p><p class="dream">Just at that moment, I cut myself off, &ldquo;oh my god look over there a
guy just go squished I am not making this up!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class="dream">The cameras whirled around, as we watched the crane lift the big
tire off the guy, and then lift the yellow truck thing that had
slipped.</p>

<p><p class="dream">I became all emotional on camera, partially truthfully, partially
melodramatically for the camera.  I began to cry, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just so sad to
have these people die, but I just have to trust that it&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s Will
and that ultimately there is a purpose to it all.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class="dream">Some workers were building a wall to help keep traffic from flying
off the bridge.  I yelled angrily (for the camera), &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad they&rsquo;re
finally building a fucking wall!&rdquo;  Then quietly to myself,
they&rsquo;ll have to beep that out heh heh.</p>

<p><p class="dream">Wende and I walked away from the cameras just in time to see two
duallies (pickup trucks with 2 tires on each side in the back) racing
through the mud and then up and onto the roadway.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s exactly that
kind of driving that caused the accident in the first place,&rdquo; I

<p><p>Have you ever had a dream that you were naked in public?  I just dreamt that Wende was naked in public.</p>

<p><p class="dream">Maggie, Wende and I were all waiting for the school bus.  We weren&rsquo;t high school age, but we were attending high school.  While we waited for the bus, Wende was wearing no shirt nor bra.</p>

<p><p class="dream">When the bus arrived, I was all, &ldquo;here; wear my shirt.&rdquo;  But she wasn&rsquo;t interested.  She just walked very closely behind me, using the back of my shirt to cover the front of her self.</p>

<p><p class="dream">Maggie sat in one of the middle seats, making new friends talking to people.  As I stepped on the bus, I found a shirt which I gave to Wende to wear.  While waiting for her to put it on, I found a seating chart that the bus driver was writing.  She was simply writing for the semester that we sit in the same seats that we chose today.</p>

<p><p class="dream">I wrote Wende and my name in a seat across from Maggie&rsquo;s.</p>

<p><p class="dream">Though we were in the city, the bus ride was way long; we ended up riding around for like 45 minutes until we were out in the country somewhere at a magnet school.  I woke up before we got to school.</p>

<p><p>Our investment</p>

<p><p>(Dammit!  I just realized that I&rsquo;m out of integrity with my dear
friend Heather because I told her I would invite her to our next open
meeting.)</p>

<p><p>Our investment club is having its open meeting today, and I&rsquo;ve
invited Jason, who has just taken the test to become a stock broker.
(For all you YRUU peeps, yes, I&rsquo;m talking about Jason Freaky.  Yes, a
stock broker.)  His method of investing is more aggressive than ours,
but I&rsquo;m still hoping he will want to join because I would love to work
with him at some type of business thing.</p>

<p><p>I have waited until the last minute to do some research that I need
to do before the meeting; I plan to visit the Houston Public Library
at 9:am when they open.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>For good measure (who invented that cliche&rsquo;?), I invited Will &amp; Molly, and Maggie &amp; John to our meeting today.  Will and Molly might attend.  Yay!!</p>

<p>I'm at KTRU as I type this on my Visor.  Mood Swingaz on vinyl performing "The Blessing"   It's been so long since I've DJed that it seems weird.  But I've been cueing perfect segues!!

<p class=date>9:34 pm</p>  

<p><p>Wende called during my so, so I put her on speakerphone as I cued up tracks and played stuff.  After a bit I was all &ldquo;okay be quiet; I&rsquo;m &lsquo;bout to go on air.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;okay&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>(on air) &ldquo;you are listening to [crash] KT (snicker)&hellip;ahem  You are listening to KTRU Houston, Rice Radio.&rdquo;  I read through the list of song I had played, then played the next song.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wende!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sorry!  I was in the garage&hellip; I tried to be quiet, but I knocked something over.&rdquo;</p>
