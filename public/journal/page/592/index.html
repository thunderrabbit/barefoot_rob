<p><p>Remember my haiku from some days ago?  I was reprimanded(?) or gently
emailed by Kevin and Karla that they did not approve.  Karla offered to
forward me some possible [appropriate] apology text.</p>

<p><p>You know what I think?  I think that an apology is just fucking useless
banter</p>

<p><p><em>We are soo sorry that we fucked up.  We&rsquo;ll do anything in the world
for you, but nothing can fix what has already been done.</em></p>

<p><p>That took me about 30 seconds to write.  The haiku took at least 5
minutes!  That&rsquo;s an order of magnitude more energy spent of fixing customer
service relations.  10 times more love sent to help heal a wound.</p>

<p><p>This business world is a fucked up place if no one fucking appreciates a
haiku!  Anyone can write &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;  Does it mean anything?  Do people
actually mean, &ldquo;I regret that I have made an error&rdquo; ?  Maybe.  But does &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sorry&rdquo; <em>do</em> anything to fix it?  No.  It&rsquo;s just crap.  Same for the
&ldquo;regret&hellip;&rdquo; line.  What good does it do to regret actions?  None.  It&rsquo;s just
negative energy tossed into the world and into one&rsquo;s self.</p>

<p><p>A haiku; a poem; a hand written card; something personal&hellip;   Those are
what are important in life.</p>

<p class=date>9:59am CDT Sunday 8 October 2000
<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>At an amusement park of sorts I was being chased by the
bad guys and I realized it was a dream.  I was able to fly around the
park, playfully following the path of a roller coaster track.  Bad
guys were firing weapons at me - everything from hand guns to machine
guns to missiles.  I dodged everything and I blasted through a wall and
picked up a machine gun that was hidden there.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I flew around, firing a spray of bullets into every bad
guy in the dream.  Like a video game, killing with no remorse and I
had unlimited ammo.  Another helper guy flew in to help me, and I
distracted a bad guy while my helper flew into him and knocked over
the bad guy.</p>

<p><p class=dream>The stage for this carnage was an unfinished tall
office building next to an amusement park roller coaster.  Big 3D
space to play and fly around.</p>

<p><p>Oh - just this morning I got my linux box configured so I have
Internet connectivity again.  New entries that therefore have just
appeared begin with 03Dream in the index above.</p>

<p class=date>5:12am CDT Tuesday 10 October 2000</p>

<p><p>This entry is difficult for me to write.</p>

<p><p>Wende is my favorite girl in the whole world.  Ironically, her sex
drive has been zero for the past several months.  We have done some
sex stuff at my request or initiation, but just a couple nights ago
she asked that I don&rsquo;t ask her anymore.  Wende feels betrayed by her
body; she wants to have a sex drive, but simply doesn&rsquo;t.  On Thursday,
she will visit an OB/GYN who uses homeopathic techniques for healing.
We have talked about counseling, but neither of us has made any
efforts toward doing that.</p>

<p><p>To support Wende, I have shifted my thinking around our
relationship.  I&rsquo;m just pretending that she&rsquo;s only my roommate or
something and not expecting anything more than verbal communication.
Now when we do kiss, I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;wow!  she kissed me!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I just rode my (borrowed) unicycle over to La Jaliscience to meet the
twins and John and Will.  I was quite pleased and smiley; I didn&rsquo;t fall all
the way here.  &ldquo;No way dude!&rdquo;  &ldquo;Yeah. I just now did it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Wende just arrived and they all got up.  &ldquo;Oh, you all get up to meet
her!&rdquo;   Except for Maggie, &ldquo;I told Rob I wouldn&rsquo;t get up for you because I
didn&rsquo;t get up for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>7:25 pm</p>

<p><p>I jumped up and knocked my chair over to hug Melanie when she walked up.</p>

<p><p class=date>8:04 pm</p>

<p><p>Wende:   &ldquo;Ooh!  I think there&rsquo;s a mushroom on my plate.&rdquo;  She picked it
out with her fork.  &ldquo;Is this a mushroom?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Maggie held out her hand and Wende wiped the specimen into her hand.
Maggie licked it up into her mouth and everyone watched in anticipation.</p>

<p><p>Suddenly Maggie spat it out and shouted &ldquo;ewww I don&rsquo;t know!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>HAHAHahAHaAHHhahahhaaAHAHAHAhahaha!!!!!</p>

<p><p>I just finished my shift at KTRU!  I&rsquo;m downstairs
at the help desk waiting for Miss Wende to come pick
me up.  It&rsquo;s all freezing cold or I&rsquo;d wait outside.</p>

<p><p>The shift was fun; I was 15 minutes late as we
zipped in from Austin.  Thanks to Jesse for covering
for me.</p>

<p><p>Early in the show I had a request for The
Clientele.  I looked for their album but didn&rsquo;t find
it.  Later in my show, I found that I had already
randomly pulled their CD from our playlist stack!!  I
said I hoped the listener was still listening..</p>

<p><p>Wende is here!</p>

<p><p>Last thing:  I said, &ldquo;playing your soft favorites,
like Merzbow!&rdquo; and played Merzbow, a noise band.</p>

<p><p>Wende and I are in New Braunfels now at her
parents&rsquo; house.  We came to see her sister Julie&rsquo;s
volleyball game last night.  Due to traffic and
silliness, we missed her game, but got to see the
&ldquo;B-Team&rdquo; game, which starred some of Julie&rsquo;s friends.
Both teams from Julie&rsquo;s school won.  The last game was
pretty close.  Like 15 to 12 I think.</p>

<p><p>We munched at Adobe Verde after that; I had Chicken
Diablo: baked chicked covered in cooked onions and
cheese with beans and rice on the side.</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;re just about to leave for a quick(!) visit to
Austin to see Wende&rsquo;s Aunt Nancy and to go skating
with her.  I&rsquo;m hoping to hook up with Manda&rsquo;s friend
Sally and my friend Karen.  I totally brain-farted and
didn&rsquo;t think to contact them <em>before</em> today; we&rsquo;ll see
how it goes.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m in at work pretty early compared to what is usual for me. I&rsquo;m in a
wonderful good mood; Wende and I are leaving to see our New Braunfels
parents and Aunt Nancy in Austin today.</p>

<p><p>On Tuesday, I sent a &ldquo;reminder&rdquo; email to one of our clients. I am pretty
sure the original email was never sent. She wrote:</p>

I'll do it, of course, but this is the first request I've had. Please send

HI Carol!

I cannot find proof that I sent the original message; it is possible that it
was never sent.

I had just taken over the process of sending emails when the first messages
were to be sent; I certainly did not intend to leave you out.

As a makeup, I will write you a haiku:


Thank You to Carol
Who will provide the feedback
Though we asked her late


Thanks!

<p><p>Yesterday I got to work early and coded some
changes to our multi-language project.  This coding
change I made is one that we may use for many of our
projects.  Basically the whole survey is presented
online in a browser window with no browser controls at
the top of the window.</p>

<p><p>This technique will hopefully keep users from
hitting the browser&rsquo;s [Back] button, which necessarily
will not save their work.  (Although as I think about
it, we could make a body tag onUnload=&ldquo;saveData()&rdquo; or
something like that.  Hmmmm.  Though that would be
more difficult to also know where the user was trying
to go..  nevermind.</p>

<p><p>Okay; we&rsquo;re leaving for breakfast now.</p>

<p class=date>9:53am CDT Wednesday 4 October 2000</p>

<p><p>Duane hasn&rsquo;t been able to figure out why our router is messed up.
See, Duane is a friend of Kevin&rsquo;s who has helped us set up our VPN for
work.  When Duane tried to set up VPN on my router, we lost all
connectivity from the house.</p>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s been down for 1.5 days, which isn&rsquo;t a huge big deal (is it?)
but I have a couple of journal entries saved on my computer here that
I wanted to FTP up to my site.  Including this one now.</p>

<p class=date>5:38am CDT Tuesday 3 October 2000
<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>In a library sitting across from Wende at the end of a
long table as we did research on something and were waiting for my
brother to arrive.  I called my dad to ask if he had heard from Fred
and essentially as soon as my dad answered the phone, Wende saw Fred
in the next room over.  To my dad, &ldquo;hey, we were looking for Fred, but
we found him,&rdquo; and Fred heard my voice so he came over.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Fred was wearing a dress looking outfit from an African
tribe and a big bag to carry his stuff in.  In a mean brotherly way I
said, &ldquo;nice purse&rdquo;  but then realized how actually cool it was that
Fred would wear this outfit here in the US.</p>

<p><p class=dream>My dad was still on the phone and I described to him
that my linux box was down (*) and that Fred might be able to fix it.
The sendmail.pid file is corrupted and there&rsquo;s a possible problem with
my .ram file.  My dad asked if the .ram files were the only ones that
I had to work with, and I explained that yes they were, but also the
.pid files which were batch files would return the pid for the process
as it was initialized.  &ldquo;The .pid file could be a batch process that
would do a PID lookup, tell the process to go run around, grab the PID
and there you go.&rdquo;  (**)</p>

<p><p class=dream>Since Fred arrived, we were going to go play at a water
park somewhere, so I went to our upstairs and began to get my frisbee
and change into my contacts instead of wearing my glasses.  (***) Fred
and Wende were down by her van in the street.  I was up a couple
stories in our motel room thing (we were apparently traveling) and was
thinking &ldquo;there&rsquo;s something I want to remember&rdquo; and I saw my frisbee
in my bag.  &ldquo;oh yeah!&rdquo; and I tossed my frisbee down to them (it angled
down toward the left instead of straight to them) and Jason (YRUU) ran
over to catch the frisbee.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Jason tossed the frisbee back up to me after I had
tossed it down and he was trying to get me to hurry up so we could
play.  We were in a dense wooded area and he said something about
chasing me so I hid behind a huge tree back by some barbed wire.  He
mock chased me and I got kinda pricked by the barbed wire and he
agilely climbed through the barbed wire and up this large dead tree
which had fallen at a 45 degree angle.  I climbed up and ooched myself
through the barbed wire and then climbed down a tree to get to where
he was and then he ran up the 45 degree angle big tree and I playfully
chased up after him.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Jason made up some funny something, &ldquo;then you have to
do this,&rdquo; shaking his arms like a chicken running up and down the
tree.  I wondered out loud, &ldquo;wow - remember when we had been climbing
on a different old tree and we wouldn&rsquo;t leave it because it was just
the coolest tree and we couldn&rsquo;t imagine any tree cooler?  Now we find
this tree and it&rsquo;s totally different but just as cool?  There&rsquo;s
something profound to be learned here.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>We finished play and climbed down and back onto the
trail.  A vietnamese girl said something like &ldquo;wait - this is where I
dropped my rental car key.&rdquo;  I had just seen it.  I walked back a few
paces and grabbed it.  &ldquo;You mean this one?&rdquo;  I wapped the key
playfully against her butt.  She was all, &ldquo;thanks!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>Then I saw my car keys <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> buried in the leaves.
Another identical set was right beside them. and another and another.
I realized it must be a dream and I would be able to see as many sets
of my keys as I wanted.  More and more began to appear.  The girl was
all &ldquo;wow!  we should grab these and turn them in to the lost and
found&rdquo; but I was all, &ldquo;no - it&rsquo;s a dream and wouldn&rsquo;t do any good.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I woke up.</p>

<p><p>(*) My linux box is actually up, but not able to connect to the
Internet.  Last night we messed with the router and never got it
working.</p>

<p><p>(**) This is a bunch of made up dream silliness.</p>

<p><p>(***) 5:48 am Wende&rsquo;s alarm went off in our bedroom.</p>
