<p>Nice meditation this morning and just finished an online group meeting
for Integration Group Coordinators.  It went well, though some
&ldquo;summaries&rdquo; from small groups seemed like they may be as long as the
originals.</p>

<p>I wanna do some work for AB, ConSwi, TEDx, and meditation.</p>

                        <p class="note">(actually written 14:12 Wednesday 24 July 2019 JST)</p>

<p>After getting a photo with Kanauknot, we headed toward the roller
coaster, but were sidetracked by a tiny house that offered free
entry.</p>

<p>(It was inside the house that I took off my shoes; they felt so
uncomfortably hot!)</p>

<p>Lin and Mikarin were like かわいいいいい at everything as I looked to
see where I could explore.  I considered using the upright piano to
access the loft, but decided not to.</p>

<p>We skipped the coaster because it&rsquo;s actually super slow, powered not
by gravity, but by motorized car tires in the front and rear cars.</p>

<p>Went to ここドコ (or maybe ココドコ) which is a 3D maze with 12 goals
where we can get stamps to find the location of the 13th stamp,
somewhere in the park.  Mikarin and I found 9 stamps of the 12 before
we accidentally ended up outside the maze area and in the exit steps.
The door locked and the structure surrounding the door did not seem
strong enough to let me climb back over to let us back in.  Fair
enough, and we headed out for more adventures.</p>

<p>Lots of mazey climby type things that would be great to play follow
the leader.  Mikarin did a pretty good job of keeping up with me.</p>

<p>Through one maze, there were too many spider webs so even I was like
&ldquo;bah; let&rsquo;s go back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From inside the fenced area, we took a picture of Lin sleeping.  (I
gotta getta license so I can help her drive.)</p>

<p>Then climbed on more stuff than I can enumerate here in a way that
will even partly make sense.  (I gotta charge my camera more
diligently.)</p>

<p>We did the Ferris Wheel after finding the ropes course type thing
called ワイヤーsomething was closed for repairs.  Apparently guests
must wear shoes in there because I saw signs for shoe rental nearby.</p>

<p>We ate lunch and then were kinda headed out of the park before I saw
the unicycle guy near some kinda balance beam type straps.  He said
they were not slackline so we could not bounce on them, but I do not
know what else to call them.</p>

<p>I balanced my way around the four short segments and then he was like
&ldquo;but can you do it backwards?&rdquo; so I walked a bit backwards.  I tried a
couple different things and I appreciated that he did not try to stop
me (though he did point out some dangers (e.g. the angled strap would
be slippery)).</p>

<p>We balanced on a large plastic ball and jumped around on it.</p>

<p>Basically I was in heaven, climbing and balancing on things.</p>

<p>At some point, he told me they had a show scheduled for 1pm.  Sounds
good, so I went to it.</p>

<p>OMG so glad I did!!</p>

<p>Though my phone conked out overnight without being charged, I was able
to get one picture with these guys</p>

<ol>
<li>before I knew I would love them</li>
<li>before I knew I didn&rsquo;t have to wear shoes in the park</li>
</ol>

<p>( image coming soon )</p>

<p>They came out to greet the incoming guests as the park opened, and I
got a picture with them because this guy was on a 2 meter tall
unicycle!</p>

<p>During the photo-op, I kinda ignored the juggler because I have seen
juggling before, but I have never been up close with a tall-ish
unicycle.</p>

<p>And to be honest, I didn&rsquo;t even really notice the woman behind me!</p>

<p>I noticed her during their 1pm show in which she and the unicyclist
did press up hand stands, a variety of balances on five different
semi-stackable chairs, and then demonstrated some amazing strength and
balance on a vertical spinning pole!</p>

<p>This culminated with him sitting in a chair on top of the pole (with
the chair leg inserted into the pole) during which I was like
<em>please-stay-strong please-stay-strong please-stay-strong</em> to the
chair leg as he spun around as she did skin-the-cats while hanging
from his arm and the pole.  (I think!)</p>

<p>Seems like half the time I could not tell <em>how</em> they were holding
themselves up on the pole; it seemed like magic!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the meantime, maybe write up your personal history and your goals
for the work you want done, and I’ll study it ahead of time, so we
can jump right in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I was a child, my dad showed me how to use coat hangers as
divining sticks to find water.  At the time, I thought it was strange.
&ldquo;Why should I have to use sticks if I can just think the question and
know the answer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did not apparently put this intuition to any practical purpose, but
I did do a few Tarot card readings based on this kind of channeled
information. I hadn&rsquo;t read about individual card meanings in Tarot,
But I would have people ask a question and then choose cards at
randomly and then I would just freestyle information that came
through.</p>

<p>I grew fascinated with the idea of &ldquo;astral travel&rdquo; and consciously, I
got as far as lucid dreaming, But not astral travel that I know of, or
at least not in the way that my imagination wanted it to happen.</p>

<p>If I practice recalling my dreams, while dreaming, I will often
recognize that &ldquo;I am in that place where I can fly and control things&rdquo;
But while in that dream state, I usually don&rsquo;t recall that my physical
body is somewhere.</p>

<p>One time while sleeping, I was doing gymnastics that I realized I
couldn&rsquo;t do my physical body.  I recognize I was in some state
of consciousness where my consciousness was outside of my body. (After
listening to your lecture, I guess this was my etheric body outside my
physical body.)</p>

<p>In the way that I naturally have proprioception, I realized my body
was folded over (which my physical body cannot do under normal waking
conditions).  I tried to allow myself to float out of my body. I got
as far as my body being up in the air, but my head was stuck inside my
head.</p>

<p>I slowly came back into waking consciousness and felt my body gliding
down into my physical body in a smooth transition, featuring lots of
vibrational tingling as the bodies merged.  (Maybe this is the same
tingling as in the shower exercise you mentioned.)</p>

<p>I felt a lot of joy and excitement around this, and I began seeking
things to study.  I read one of Robert Monroe&rsquo;s books and soon went to
The Monroe Institute for their week long Gateway Voyage residential
training (in 1997 or so, a few years after his death).</p>

<p>At TMI&rsquo;s Gateway Voyage, I had a few interesting experiences regarding
states of consciousness, but did not &ldquo;astral travel&rdquo; the way I had
hoped.</p>

<p>We got to meet Joe McMoneagle and I became facinated with the how the
Life Review works upon death (or near death).   (You mentioned the
tunnel of light and said you can talk more about  that process.  I
would be curious to do so as I remember one of my experiences as a
ghost believing I did not deserve to go through the tunnel.)</p>

<p>At TMI, we watched the Powers of Ten video
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powers_of_Ten_(film)#1977_(%22Final%22)_version">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powers_of_Ten_(film)#1977_(%22Final%22)_version</a>
and I cried for a grain of sand in the sidewalk after recognizing how
it had been ignored despite is crucial role in the world.</p>

<p>Around the same time, I began emotional catharsis work with Mankind
Project.  In my weekend training, I realized I was physically a man.
At age 27, I still felt like a boy.</p>

<p>I am going to make a jump here from biography to underlying patterns.</p>

<p>I often suffer from anger issues.  I once complained to my parents
that they were being too nice to each other.  I might describe their
behavior now as having been codependent.  They didn&rsquo;t take care of
their own needs first.</p>

<p>I have often given my power away to women, trying to make mommy happy
so that I can get her love.  I recognize that the work is to be done
within myself, and the reality of the world around me is a reflection
of that.  These are words I can say theoretically, but I don&rsquo;t really
know what they mean for me nor how to apply them in my life.</p>

<p>I often fall into crushes with women, and I have learned to deal with
that by simply not acting on it&hellip;</p>

<p>I get the very most easily angry when I judge people do not understand
me.  (How very curious I find myself in a cross-cultural marriage
where not being understood is the norm.)</p>

<p>Looking for the source of this anger regarding communication, the only
things that have kind of made sense are from past lives that I&rsquo;ve
uncovered.</p>

<p>One spontaneous past life memory was when my army buddy was killed
after not listening to my guidance.</p>

<p>In another past life, there was a larger scale massacres where
thousands of my men were ambushed and died due to a tactical mistake I
had made.  (where they DID listen to me and it got them killed)</p>

<p>In other past life news, I have a birthmark where apparently I was
stabbed, and I recall dying, feeling so sad that my wife would not get
the money that I had earned while being in war.  (This lifetime, the
first time I washed my wife&rsquo;s back, I remembered that it was not the
first time I had washed her back, and in fact my present-lifetime wife
may have played the role of the woman who I left with kids while I
died in battle.)</p>

<p>In a different past life, I remember being a big simple man, who was
taking care of by a witch who lived up the hill because she was
ostracized by the community.  She would send me into town with simple
shopping tasks.</p>

<p>In a different past life (which I mentioned above), I committed ritual
suicide and remained on earth believing my transgression had been too
great to let me go to &lsquo;heaven&rsquo;.  The facilitator (Kevin Turner, who
you may well know) said &ldquo;look up&rdquo; and my dead-self looked up and was
shocked to see everyone waiting patiently for me.  My physical self
started bawling and crying like oh my god finally, etc etc.</p>

<p>Back to my present lifetime:</p>

<p>At age 8 or so this lifetime, my dad told me how incredibly smart and
talented I was.  In some ways, this information has been a curse on
me, as I have assumed I should be able to figure things out.  I often
shame myself for not having figured things out the first time through.</p>

<p>In a different anecdote from this lifetime, my dad and I were paddling
in a canoe on the lake somewhere.  It was a beautiful father-son
experience. His friend came by with the small motorboat, and offered to
tow us ashore.  The experience of the raw speed in a canoe was
thrilling.  I absolutely loved it and would love to do it again
sometime.  Afterward, my dad said his friend said I was &ldquo;grinning from
ear to ear.&rdquo;  I hated to know that I had been seen and that I had
been somehow caught in this moment of joy.</p>

<p>And yet another anecdote from this lifetime, my dad knocked down a
wasps&rsquo; nest from under the eave of our house.  The wasps were all dead,
but I was still scared of the nest.  I gathered up all of my courage
and threw the nest into the street, then suddenly heard cheers from my
parents.  I was shocked and angry that they had been watching me the
whole time.  Somehow my test of courage had not been such a test after
all.  I should&rsquo;ve known it wasn&rsquo;t dangerous because they (apparently)
knew it.</p>

<p>At this point I am taking a break in writing.</p>

<h5 id="17-13-thursday-25-july-2019-jst">17:13 Thursday 25 July 2019 JST</h5>

<p>Main things I would like to look at in our work</p>

<p>Improve my ability to find clients who value my services.  I would
like to make enough money that I can let go of my current programming
job and let my wife feel comfortable in doing work she loves instead
of doing work for money.</p>

<p>I often get feedback that what I said was really helpful or
insightful.  My secret is that it&rsquo;s often channeled information,
though I do not know much about my source.  Would like to learn more
about the source and how to build a relationship with my source.</p>

<p>I have listened to Bashar as channeled by whatshisname (who keeps
saying extraterrestrial disclosure is coming), and have been listening
to Abraham as channeled by Esther Hicks.  I love what you said about
it being simplified.   However, the reason I brought up these channels
is that I have sometimes thought I could do that.  Should I keep it
low-key and just channel as I mentioned above.  As I wrote the
question, the answer came: meet my channelee first.</p>

<p>I feel fear and sadness when I don&rsquo;t pursue this line of questions.  I
want you (or someone, anyone but meeeee) to give me all the answers.
Holy cats maybe that is my sadness of being disconnected from my
channelee.  (is there a word for that? the spirit being channeled?)</p>

<p>When reading the book <em>Shaving The Inside of Your Skull</em>, I created my
own religion, ROBOT (Rob&rsquo;s Own Brand of Teachings), which includes the
concept of EPP, the Ever Present Present.  Why did I even bring that
up with you now?</p>

<p>Improve my skillset in terms of healing.  I have always been
fascinated with astral, and finding your simple structured
introduction has been lovely.  What you say makes sense to my maps and
seems like something I could easily put into practice.</p>

<p>Improve connection in our marriage.  I hide parts of myself from my
wife Lin out of fear of her reaction.</p>

<p>Spend more time on my art projects because they are fun and bring a
lot of joy to me in making and people in seeing.  How can they support
my financial abundance?</p>

<p>One camping spot remained when we arrived yesterday.  It&rsquo;s the high
season and reservations are recommended.  We set up the tent which
thankfully came with ropes to keep it from rotate-collapsing.</p>

<p>This tent is &ldquo;easy&rdquo; to set up because it has a &ldquo;one touch&rdquo; function
that kinda springs the four foldable(!) legs into a spidery stance.
Without its rain tarp tied to the legs and the rain tarp tied to the
environment, it&rsquo;s flimsy af, but with the 6 provided ropes in place,
it&rsquo;s reasonably fine.</p>

<p>I am a bit envious of Taro&rsquo;s larger tent next door, with its three
arcing support tubes, but our setup is pretty sweet, too.</p>

<p>After setting up the tent, we had an lovely dinner including easy-cook
rice in bags that kinda cooks itself in 15 minutes after we pour water
into the rice in the bag.</p>

<p>I had a seated shower at the communal bath house with four shower
seats and one bath.  I apparently arrived at rush hour; there were no
fewer than 4 adults and an average of two boys each in the room.</p>

<p>I read Bedtime for Bear to Lin and Mikarin and then lights out at
10pm, just before a young girl started wailing crying.  She eventually
cried herself out, but apparently started again at midnight, according
to Lin.  This bear was sleeping by then and did not notice.</p>

<p>Today Naoko worked on introducing the history zone, including teacup
carrying dolls, perpetual clock, and the early days of electricity in
Japan.</p>

<p>What was it like back in the day when a simple thing like a few candle
power light bulb could be so impressive?</p>

<p>Yasu talked about the Meissner effect and flux pinning.  I would like
to do an experiment..  will the Meissner effect keep a thing suspended
above the magnetic table or is that only do to flux pinning?</p>

<p>Liliko confirmed some changes to some quiz questions for a new exhibit
that will be an audio recognition quiz.</p>

<p>I have been doing MKP stuff for a while.  Today I expressed in my
online group that I did not want to be there and I do not always want
to be there.  I am so thankful that I could just let loose with a
barrage|littany of the stuff rolling through my mind and the men could
be there just to hear me.  It was stuff like</p>

<pre><code>&quot;I don't fucking want to always be here and I don't want to check
out by email and that all started from when I just said I wanted
to start the group on time and now here we are today not starting
on time and a bunch of men checking out via email neither of which
is what I fucking was trying for in the first place.  If I am not
here the group might miss me and I might miss the perfect person
to facilitate me, and I miss JG and he is not here&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>blah blah like that for a bit.</p>

<p>The learning I got from that was the title of my upcoming blog entry,
&ldquo;Self care must come first&rdquo; though I will probably add &ldquo;usually&rdquo; in
there somewhere. This is certainly true for a group of peers, each of
whom can ostensibly take care of themselves.</p>

<p>If I do not take care of myself, then I can not be there for the
group.</p>

<p>Dangit.  Speaking of which, my wrists are hurting while I I type this
(on the train, so voice transcription is not a polite option).  Where
is the self care now?</p>

<p>Lin and I walked around our neighborhood, which couulllddd possibly
count as a Walk that I started doing last year and dropped after
getting to 14 or so.</p>

<p>During this walk, I practiced a process I heard on an Esther Hicks
video recently.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re my favorite rock.  You&rsquo;re my favorite leaf.
You&rsquo;re my favorite tree.&rdquo; etc</p>

<p>I found the transcription at the bottom of
<a href="https://grandledgeucc.org/mt-content/uploads/2019/06/sermon_06_09_2019.pdf">this PDF from a church newsletter(?)</a>
I look forward to finding the video where the transcription came from.</p>

<pre><code>1. Meditate for 15 minutes every day. Getting centered and
   clearing your mind can make a world of difference in our feelings.

2. Go outside no matter what the weather and move around in
   appreciation of this planet. Look up and around and find things
   to acknowledge, and talk about them right out loud: say things
   like: you are my favorite bird, you are my favorite flower in
   bloom, you are my favorite flower not in bloom, you are my
   favorite tree, you are my favorite frog, who kept me awake all
   night, you are my favorite rock. etc

3. Buy a notepad, call it your Book of Positive Aspects, and fill
   5 pages of positive aspects about a thing or subject or a person.

4. And the last thing. Every single day look upward and outward,
   best if you do it outside or standing near a window, and
   acknowledge that there are Universal Forces, God, focused right
   at us, and then say: 'I acknowledge that I am the object of
   your positive attention, and I'm appreciating your continual
   gaze on behalf of my well-being, and today, no matter where I
   am, no matter where I'm going, no matter who I'm doing it with,
   I will be in conscious awareness that you too are there with
   me, appreciating me, supporting me, assisting me, acknowledging
   me, inspiring me, guiding me, having fun with me, helping me,
   being aware of me, loving me, showing me, uplifting me...  get
   into an endless loop of that kind of acknowledgement, and watch
   what happens in your life.
