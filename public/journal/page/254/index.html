<p>Lin and I went to Aruna&rsquo;s house today; Aruna told us about homeopathy and opened the door to a new way of healthiness.   I had heard of it, but just thought homeopathy meant eating well, but apparently it&rsquo;s a pretty specific matching of energetic frequencies to facilitate health.</p>

<p>While chatting with Colleen we had a little earthquake.  Colleen wasn&rsquo;t impressed that I was unimpressed with earthquakes in general, but meh, most of them are no big deal.</p>

<p>Then, just moments after I saw the details of the earthquake posted online, a bowl broke in the kitchen!  It seems like an unrelated event, but one can never be too sure!  It was the small clear glass bowl that I liked using for granola, so I told Lin, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t buy another bowl just to replace this one.   I can use the bottom of a larger bowl to hold the same amount of granola.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>8:57pm Wednesday 10 April 2013</strong></p>

<p>Pretty good day; our new server on AWS had been barfing hourly errors like, &ldquo;the MySQL server has gone away&rdquo; or &ldquo;could not connect to mySQL server&rdquo; even though 99.n% of the connections were fine.  We had been using MySQL 5.6, and certainly I may not have had it set up right.  Once I instantiated a server with 5.5 (and reverted the DB to MyISAM tables for those with FULLTEXT indices), it has worked perfectly fine.</p>

<p>Today Jonas started tweaking the front page of AB new frontend; it was fun for me to hit reload on the test server throughout the day and see it taking shape.  All that CSS and design shit still eludes me.  Or maybe I just have no interest.</p>

<p>I wrote a new class that will just be some static functions that do custom queries of the DB.  I might look into writing functions that live in the DB, but I&rsquo;m not sure if it will really make a big difference.  I was seeing 0.0003 seconds per (cached) query in my class; that should be enough for now.</p>

<p><strong>9:41pm Wednesday 10 April 2013</strong></p>

<p>I looked into STORED FUNCTIONS and was like no way ferget that, and then I remembered oh <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/create-view.html">MySQL VIEWs</a> are what I want.  Nice.  Compiled queries so they&rsquo;re even faster.  0.0002 seconds nice.</p>

<p><strong>8:29pm Wednesday 10 April 2013</strong></p>

<p>Lin and I were both feeling kinda sick last week. I&rsquo;ve not meditated in a while, though I might start soon. We&rsquo;re feeling mostly better now, but I&rsquo;ve still got some congestion.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s not why I&rsquo;m writing. Lin is talking about starting a diary. I&rsquo;m fully supportive of such things, and hope she gets a lot lot lot and tons of benefit from it. Online or offline is fine; I can give her some tips and encouragement.</p>

<p>My main tip for any kind of diary writing, especially if you wanna do it for a while:</p>

<p><strong>write the full date at the top of every entry</strong>. Or the bottom. Or both. But the point is do NOT just write <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> cause I promise, even if you can be sure you meant April 10th and not the 4th of October, you may be hard pressed to remember the year. And even if <em>you</em> can remember the year, someone who finds the diary after you will <em>not</em> remember the year. I use 4 digits for the year (how shortsighted of me!!!), always write the month out as a word, and almost always write the time as well, including am or pm.</p>

<p>The next most important tip might be the most important:</p>

<p><strong>start writing again if you have a lapse.</strong> And don&rsquo;t try to catch up. In my handwritten journals, I remember having stopped writing because I got all busy. I wanted to write again, but I was like &ldquo;ah crap; how will I write everything that&rsquo;s happened in 4 months?&rdquo; That thought blocked me from writing for a month. Then I was like, &ldquo;oh crap; how will I write everything that&rsquo;s happened in 5 months?&rdquo; <em>That</em> thought blocked me for a month until I realized the futility and just wrote what happened that day. I released the need to write about the prior 6 months and just started writing as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>Other tips that are not as important, but may be useful</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In a handwritten diary, leave a couple pages in front blank to be an index.  Fill it in with highlights once the book is full</p></li>

<li><p>Every month or year or so, write an overview of your situation. I got the idea from the State of The Union Addresses in the US; I call them State of My Life Addresses.</p></li>

<li><p>Only read old entries if it&rsquo;s been a year since you wrote them.  Otherwise, don&rsquo;t read; just write.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The newsletter I received includes this &ldquo;sample text&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi Rob,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Describe what you have to offer the customer. Why should they read? What did you promise them in the subject line?
Tell them something cool. Make them laugh. Make them cry. Well, maybe don&rsquo;t do that&hellip;</p>

<p>Use a list to:</p>

<p>Explain the value of your offer
Remind the reader what they’ll get out of taking action
Show off your skill with bullet points
Make your content easy to scan
LINK TO A LANDING PAGE ON YOUR SITE (This is the really important part.)</p>

<p>Now wrap it all up with a pithy little reminder of how much you love them.</p>

<p>Aw. You silver-tongued devil, you.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Your name</p>

<p>Ooops.  Well I guess they won&rsquo;t do that again soon.</p>

<p><strong>10:55am Saturday 30 March 2013</strong></p>

<p>Came in to work today to move AB from server which we didn&rsquo;t totally control to one which we control a lot more.  We still don&rsquo;t have to touch the hardware, but now we have sudo access as needed.</p>

<p>The move was smooth; the longest part was waiting for DNS to update.</p>
