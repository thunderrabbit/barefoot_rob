<p>Only reason I am not sure rests in the fact that I had to switch to
LetsEncrypt &ndash;staging certs, so now my browser does not trust the
site.  As far as I can tell, though the SSL is installed properly.
Yay!</p>

<p>I may switch to my domain for testing again tomorrow.</p>

<p>We had two new men in I-group on Tuesday.  Awesome. I&rsquo;m now suggesting
that we meet every week, instead of just twice a month.  I&rsquo;ve emailed
Prentiss to see about running the initial 6 week I-group protocols.</p>

<p>Okay, so today is Day 1 of my newly modified keyboard layout.  Day 1
as in Hour 1 of Day 1.  Just started this.</p>

<p>And I like it better already.</p>

<p>Problem isn&rsquo;t Emacs Pinky; it&rsquo;s .. what?. PHP Pinky?</p>

<p>My right Pinky hurts from too many dang backspaces and stuff.  So
backspace was the first key to be disabled.  Taking its place is the
semicolon.  So now Pinky doesn&rsquo;t have to move to backspace, which is
pretty much its most common job.</p>

<p>Next up: Return.  My return key is way over there, so I&rsquo;m going to
turn it off and have&hellip;. apostrophe take its place.</p>

<p>Oh wait apostrophe is already remapped to hyphen.  Okay, I-ll</p>

<p>oops.  I;</p>

<p>oops.  I[</p>

<p>fack!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll leave Return as is.. oh maybe I can swap the current hyphen for return and return for apostrophe.  Okay brb.</p>

<h2 id="18-11-monday-06-february-2017-jst">18:11 Monday 06 February 2017 JST</h2>

<p>Okay now</p>

<ul>
<li>semicolon is backspace (awesome)</li>
<li>apostrophe is enter</li>
<li>enter is hyphen</li>
<li>F7 is semicolon</li>
<li>F8 is apostrophe</li>
<li>F9 is left bracket</li>
<li>F10 is right bracket</li>
</ul>

<p>hyphen is still hyphen, so that&rsquo;s a bit weird.</p>

<p>Hmm and Pinky still hurts even just hitting (the new) enter, so we are going to have to be a bit more drastic.</p>

<p>This is hard.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll think about it a bit.</p>

<h2 id="18-16-monday-06-february-2017-jst">18:16 Monday 06 February 2017 JST</h2>

<p>That was fast.  What I&rsquo;d like to try is having left-shift-space as enter.</p>

<p>I wonder if that&rsquo;s possible with this software.  (Karabiner-Elements)</p>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t seem like it.</p>

<p>Now ansible is reporting it cannot connect to AWS though I am sure
nothing has changed on this virtual machine.  Especially nothing
related to the AWS keys.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m spinning up a new box now; if that doesn&rsquo;t work, then I&rsquo;ll assume
the problem is not on my end and switch to a different project.</p>

<p>I woke up early today; I asked
<a href="https://wiki.robnugen.com/wiki/Items:Noisy">Noisy</a> to wake me up at
5:25 so I could &ldquo;get some work done&rdquo; before heading to see Mikarin&rsquo;s
piano recital.  I&rsquo;m bummed I&rsquo;ll miss SOGO (again (last week was due to
choosing to prepare for Head Heart and Soul presentation (and the week
before was cancelled by the organizers))), BUT as I sat down to &ldquo;do
work&rdquo; I felt cold, tired, and was like, boom</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have an idea!&rdquo; and I went outside and ran.  Well, jogged.  Up the
hill (as far as the second street light, after which I walked), up the
next little hill, down the stairrrrrrs, and then jogged back up the
hill and the next hill and then was going to head home, but fuckit not
tired yet so down the staiiirrrrrrrs again then jogged up the hill and
back past the pokestop to our house.</p>

<p>I think I will do this regularly.  I&rsquo;ll skip it on the days that Noisy
is set at that time so I can go to work, but do it on other days.  And
then maybe go to bed; who knows, but I&rsquo;m going to start waking up
early again.</p>

<p>Three hour wake-up call had me angry at one point and sad at the end.
Headache now, but not sure if it&rsquo;s from too much computer moreso than
the conversation.  Lots of attacks on the way my life is going: no
kids equals alone in the end.</p>

<p>Yeah so what I&rsquo;ve come to recognize is that I trust my intuition /
future abilities to take care of myself and my relationship.  I <em>do</em>
believe there&rsquo;s a spiritual component to &ldquo;all of this&rdquo; (and at a
different level I believe &ldquo;all of this&rdquo; is a physical component of the
real world), and trust I am where I need to be in my life.</p>

<pre><code>[2/2/17, 11:25:56 AM] caught-in-middle: Hi, I updated ticket #2978. Please check when you can.
</code></pre>

<p>ticket 2978:</p>

<pre><code>The code we gave you before doesn't display the page views correctly.
Could you switch the code to this?
</code></pre>

<p><a href="//b.robnugen.com/journal/2017/work/placeholder.png"><img src="//b.robnugen.com/journal/2017/work/thumbs/placeholder.png" alt="placeholder" /></a></p>

<p>Uh, yeah that&rsquo;s not going to work.  <code>{{$article-&gt;title}}</code> is obviously a placeholder.</p>

<pre><code>[2/2/17, 12:20:07 PM] Rob Nugen: thank you.  I got it, but I need
    a little bit of time to test.  I need to change the part that says
    {{$article-&gt;title}} to be the actual article title.
[2/2/17, 7:15:47 PM] caught-in-middle: Thank you for checking. Ok, hope it goes smoothly.
[2/3/17, 10:35:18 AM] Rob Nugen: Okay I've moved this online



[2/3/17, 12:13:38 PM] caught-in-middle: Thank you.
    But this code doesn’t work. It doesn’t display titles correctly.
    Didi you test this code?

<pre><code>[2/3/17, 12:13:52 PM] Rob Nugen: yes
[2/3/17, 12:14:29 PM] caught-in-middle: hmm could send us screenshot or something?
[2/3/17, 12:14:58 PM] Rob Nugen: a screenshot of what?
[2/3/17, 12:15:11 PM] caught-in-middle: some evedence
[2/3/17, 12:16:08 PM] Rob Nugen: clients-website,com/rss_fb.php
[2/3/17, 12:16:58 PM] Rob Nugen: all the titles are correct.
[2/3/17, 12:17:15 PM] Rob Nugen: search for 'set', 'title' on that link and they are all there.
[2/3/17, 12:23:51 PM] Rob Nugen: On the source of this page clients-website,com/ja/news/63...
    all the titles are correct
[2/3/17, 12:24:01 PM] Rob Nugen: I don't see php or fb_ anywhere on the source of the page.
[2/3/17, 12:24:20 PM] Rob Nugen: I'm not sure how the screenshot you showed me saw the name of the variable.
[2/3/17, 12:24:28 PM] Rob Nugen: do you know where the data is coming from on that screenshot?
[2/3/17, 12:25:21 PM] caught-in-middle: That is a screenshot of google analytics.
[2/3/17, 12:25:30 PM] caught-in-middle: google,com/analytics/web/?authuser=2#home/xyzyourmomwashere/
[2/3/17, 12:25:43 PM] caught-in-middle: I don’t know if you can see the page
[2/3/17, 12:25:54 PM] Rob Nugen: I can't, unfortunately,
[2/3/17, 12:26:07 PM] Rob Nugen: is it only happening for that news?
[2/3/17, 12:28:39 PM] caught-in-middle: Sorry I’m not sure. Boss left for lunch. I’ll Skype you when he’s back.
[2/3/17, 12:28:51 PM] Rob Nugen: okay
[2/3/17, 12:29:18 PM] Rob Nugen: I have to go out for a bit as well
[2/3/17, 12:29:38 PM] Rob Nugen: if you need to call me feel free.  or via Skype you can call
[2/3/17, 12:29:42 PM] caught-in-middle: Of course
[2/3/17, 12:29:51 PM] caught-in-middle: Ok, thank you,
[2/3/17, 12:30:08 PM] Rob Nugen: no worries
[2/3/17, 4:06:20 PM] caught-in-middle: The reason why Boss has changed the code is to display the titles
    correctly on Google analytics. If you haven’t check Google analytics, please create your account.
    There are many other companies trying to be able to check the page views of Instant articles on Google
    analytics. Please search references and FAQs.
[2/3/17, 4:10:53 PM] Rob Nugen: I have a Google analytics account, but I don't have access to Client-website
    analytics.
[2/3/17, 4:11:27 PM] Rob Nugen: In order to give myself access to Client-website analytics, I need to
    change the tracking code, which will limit your access to see the analytics.
[2/3/17, 4:12:34 PM] Rob Nugen: There may be a way for you to add my account to view your analytics,
    but I'm not familiar with how to administer that service.
[2/3/17, 4:13:15 PM] Rob Nugen: I believe if you add rob@monkey.net then I'll be able to see them
[2/3/17, 4:20:53 PM] Rob Nugen: I have access now; thank you
[2/3/17, 4:23:05 PM] caught-in-middle: Could you test the code checking Google analytics?
[2/3/17, 4:24:31 PM] Rob Nugen: Yes, but first  I don't know how to get the same report you sent as a screenshot this morning.
[2/3/17, 4:24:40 PM] Rob Nugen: can you help me see the problem?
[2/3/17, 4:31:03 PM] caught-in-middle: Of course.
google,com/analytics/web/?authuser=2#realtime/borkborkcaptainspork
[2/3/17, 4:31:26 PM] caught-in-middle: it’s client-website site - realtime - contents
[2/3/17, 4:32:23 PM] caught-in-middle: Page titles of Instant articles are messed up
</code></pre>

<p>Ticket 2978</p>

<pre><code>On Google Analytics, I noticed these news items had title '{{$article-&gt;title}}' which matches the code suggested by Google, I guess

/ja/news/63...
/ja/news/62...
/ja/news/64...

Instead of waiting for more items to show up on Google Analytics,
I went through all the published items on Facebook Instant
articles page. The following items also had '{{$article-&gt;title}}'
as their title

List of titles of articles with incorrect analytics code
List of titles of articles with incorrect analytics code
List of titles of articles with incorrect analytics code
List of titles of articles with incorrect analytics code
List of titles of articles with incorrect analytics code
List of titles of articles with incorrect analytics code
List of titles of articles with incorrect analytics code
List of titles of articles with incorrect analytics code

List of titles of articles with incorrect analytics code
List of titles of articles with incorrect analytics code
List of titles of articles with incorrect analytics code
List of titles of articles with incorrect analytics code
List of titles of articles with incorrect analytics code
List of titles of articles with incorrect analytics code

I corrected all of the above articles manually on Facebook instant article page

This item had title including 'php echo $fb_item_title;'

/ja/news/65...

I have also corrected this item. I believe the incorrect title must
have been read by Facebook during the time I activated the update of
the website.
</code></pre>

<p>Now, how to fix <em>that</em>, I don&rsquo;t know, but it kinda made me angry that
they were like &ldquo;did you test the code?&rdquo;  When it&rsquo;s clearly the case
they manually edited all those articles incorrectly.  I never deployed
code with <code>{{$article-&gt;title}}</code> in it.</p>
