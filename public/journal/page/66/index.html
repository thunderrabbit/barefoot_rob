<p>Today is the last day of winter holiday for me.  Lin and I have been
back home for a week, during which I have mostly worked on Godot, read
<em>The Power of Now</em>, watched movies with Lin, and worked a bit on MT3.</p>

<p>This past Saturday, we went to see her family for Happy New Year, and
I have been chatting with her niece in English on LINE since then.</p>

<p>We watched The Last Jedi (Star Wars episode 8) last night in the
theater (Lin slept a little) and then The Phantom Menace (episode 1)
at home via Amazon (199 yen rental for 48 hours) (I slept a little and
Lin slept a lot).</p>

<p>Oh, and this is the time that Meltdown and Spectre are making the
news.  Intel stock is down a bit, but probably not for long.</p>

<p>My Android phone is not plugged in, but when I took it out of my
pocket, I found it &ldquo;Installing system update&rdquo; with an eye-candy white
circle to distract me from the fact that it&rsquo;s doing the update while
on battery, without my having asked for the update.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s rebooting now, so seems the update completed. I hope!</p>

<h2 id="13-27">13:27</h2>

<p>Now it says &ldquo;Android is upgrading&rdquo; with a subtitle &ldquo;Optimizing app 28
of 271&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="13-31">13:31</h2>

<p>188 of 271</p>

<h2 id="13-35">13:35</h2>

<p>Update and reboot complete</p>

<p>Met Tariq to talk about next steps on our game.  My next step is to
see about having a backend we can talk to.  His next step is to design
the progression of levels and think about audio within the game.</p>

<p>We have arrived back in Haneda and are in a taxi back home.  Didn&rsquo;t
realize trains would not be running very late so yay for 12000 yen for
stale smoke flavored taxi.</p>

<p>Last train was at 11:51 and would require two transfers, including
from KQ Kawasaki to JR Kawasaki station.</p>

<p>I get to work on MT3 tomorrow yayyy!</p>

<p>Had a little nap for 3 hours or so</p>

<p>Distracted now watching Logan Lucky while writing and trying to
remember whsat I was going to write.</p>

<p>While sleeping I guess I felt the plane dip a bit and it appeared in
my dream</p>

<p class="dream">We descended and hovered down by the water down by
the cruise ship.  I didn't recognize any of my old friends there, but
was optimistic there were some onboard.  It seemed we were a couple of
days after everyone else, so the cheerful arrival high had waned. I
remembered I had not brought Francois on this trip, and it would be
even more acute here on the ship.  I saw some other stuffed animals
and considered another replacement but decided not to.  Woke up soon
thereafter</p>

<p>Writing very slowly, it&rsquo;s now 3 hours to Haneda.</p>

<p>We arrived and went to the baggage claim but, fortunately thanks to
Lin checking first, we discovered we could <em>not</em> get our checked
baggage in Dubai when staying in hotels in the airport.</p>

<p>But what&rsquo;s awesome: the guy was like beep beep beep and said our
baggage would be redirected to Haneda just like that boom. Automatic
scanners and stuff.  I know it&rsquo;s both amazing and meh, makes sense.
Also awesome: we thereby did not have to pay a fee for overweight bags
despite this airport allegedly being strict.</p>

<p>We had to go through security again, but I guess we couldn&rsquo;t get our
bags because they don&rsquo;t want us to escape into the city without visas,
which we don&rsquo;t have.</p>

<p>Lin bought eyeliner during our 15+ minute walk to the hotel in
Concourse C, and is buying a T-shirt (and probably other stuff) now.
I showered and considered shaving but nah it can wait until we get
back.</p>

<p>I am certainly getting tired.  I did not sleep the last 4 hours of the
flight as planned.  I kept working on Godot and then watched the last
couple or three episodes of Lucifer season 2.</p>

<p>The flight was scheduled to be 14 hours, so I have been awake about 17
hours since my last entry.</p>

<p>Okay, yes I woke up at 20:47 and it is now 14:49 the next day.</p>

<p>So, call them 20 and 14, so actually 18 hours as of this entry.</p>

<p>It is 01:49 Monday 1 January 2018 in Tokyo, and I should be sleeping
soon, but I guess we won&rsquo;t sleep for 1.5 hours after we land, so about
2 hours from now.</p>

<p>I have had a few crashes in Godot in the over the past couple of days,
and each time it was due to using <code>queue_free()</code> (or apparently
misusing it).  I took them out in favor of <code>hide()</code> and <code>remove()</code>.
The crashes seem to have gone away.</p>

to figure out how to do it.  I found</p>

<pre><code>extends &quot;classname.gd&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>But I want to extend the scene as well.  I will try a couple things,
but I am getting tired haha.</p>

<p>Ten point five hours to go in our flight.  It&rsquo;s 5am Sao Paulo time,
and 4pm Tokyo time.  I took a 3.5 hour nap in Sao Paulo and woke up
around 8:45pm (and wrote a journal entry about a dream I had writing a
journal entry about a dream I had) and have thereby been awake 8
hours.  I plan to be awake 6 more hours, at which point I will have 4
more hours of flight time to sleep before we arrive in Dubai.</p>

<p>I think we arrive a couple/few hours before Happy New Year celebration
starts in Dubai.</p>

<p>When it&rsquo;s midnight in Dubai, I think it will be 5am in Tokyo.  I will
sleep for a few hours, waking up at maybe 9 or 10am Tokyo time, by
which point I plan to have reversed A and P, and be over any residual
jetlag.</p>
