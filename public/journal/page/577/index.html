<p class=date>10:44pm CST Friday 22 December 2000</p></p>

<p>At work today I made a Flash "movie" thing (the kind that requires
Shockwave to view on a web browser), and it's corny, but I'm pretty
impressed with my ability to make it do a few cool things.</p>

<p>Wende and I arrived at home essentially literally at the same
moment.  She was right behind me on our street as we drove up.  Inside
and her mood was grumpy: hungry, but didn't know what to eat, tired
after long day at work, etc.  I thought as I went to get the mail,
<em>We should go out tonight.</em></p>

<p>In one of Wende's Christmas cards, she received some cash.  She
said, "this is a sign.  We need to go out tonight."  Perfect.</p>

<p>We saw <em>Family Man</em>, starring Nicholas Cage and Te'a Leone
(sp).  Excellent film.  Fabulous date movie.  I cried so much watching
this movie.  Just such passion and true love.  And sooo cute in many
scenes with his kids.  Lots of laughs, no blood, so much fun.</p>

<p>Thank you, Film People, for such a great show.</p>

<p>I left the theater feeling <em>so much</em> love for Wende and
<em>so</em> incredibly thankful for our life.  Absolutely amazing.</p>

<p class=date>6:40pm Thursday 21 December 2000</p></p>

<p>Wende and I just saw <em>What Women Want</em>, which was witty with
well-tied ends to all its storylines.  Great date movie, I think.</p>

<p>Now I'm at work, where I was surprised to find the Third Partner who
started this company with Kevin and Karla back in the day.  He doesn't come
around much; I certainly didn't expect him to be here this late.  (He wasn't
here when I left at 3:30 to see the movie with Wen.)</p>

<p>My goal now is to work a bit more and then zip home.</p>

<p>Today my mood has shifted from ridiculously pissed
to just workin' at work.</p>

<p>The anger stemmed from being turned down again by
Wende; we both feel bad about it; I think we both
don't know what to do about it.</p>

<p>Then when I got to work, a canned email from
Network Solutions proved they did not read my original
email to them and pissed me off more.  (camel's back
and straw and stuff)  I wrote them a short seething
email.  Then I removed the cuss words including 4
occurences of "FUCKING."  Then I rewrote it without
using ALL CAPS.  I sent the modified message; I don't
expect an intelligent reply.</p>

<p>While Kevin helped me organize our plan for
shifting the Wack Project to the format of the Generic
Project, Kasi, Erika and Butch went to get sandwiches
for everyone; I feel a lot better after having an idea
of what work I can do, and after having eaten.</p>

<p>I feel a unicycle ride coming up in a few
hours.</p>

<p>Awright, I've got an idea of how data is currently being written in
the Wack Project; now I need to "get with" Patrick to see how we can
convert it to the Generic (Cool) Project.  Before I do that, I'm going to go ride my (borrowed) unicycle.</p>

<p class=date>4:28pm</p>

<p>Had a good ride down to the bridge, and fell only once..  couldn't
seem to get past a steep 2-3 inch bump.  It wasn't a hump but a
discontinuity in the sidewalk.  Shorter but steeper.  Oh well.  I
finally gave up on it and unied the rest of the way to the bridge,
including up the 10 inch hump.</p>

<p>Men were there pouring and smoothing concrete on the road leading
up to the bridge and I watched them for a while.  Didn't really talk
to them, but they commented on the uni.  As I got on to leave, I
immediately fell worse than I have in recent memory, fortunately into
the grass.  On the second try I was up and rode all the way back, including down the 10 inch hump.</p>

<p>Our MS expert at work is not able to get my new

Personal Web Server to run on the machine.  Or Peer
Web Server.  Or linux and apache.  This is so fuckin'
stupid that it's so difficult to get this shit to

<p>Extra super duper special thanks to Kevin for his
calm, measured determination in getting my web server
stuff working.</p>

<p>While I had (have) visions of throwing the PC
through Bill Gates' window, Kevin carefully examined
the differences between his machine and my machine,
etc blah blah blah and got the shit working.</p>

<p>Basically we had to uninstall all the Peer Web
stuff and reinstall it all again.  This action was
simple enough, but I maintain that it should not be
necessary.</p>

<p>Microsoft still sucks.</p>

<p>To forget about my computer woes, I looked at all
the models of the <a
href="https://www.sodaplay.com">Soda Zoo</a>, which are
pretty amazing.</p>

<p>Then I unied from our parking lot down to the
construction area by the bridge.  This time I
successfully unied <em>up</em> the big ten inch hump
in the sidewalk!  Interestingly, on the way down
there, I fell a few times (but made it up the hump on
the first try), yet on the way back, I made it all the
way back without falling once, including going down
that steep hump!  Wow!  And Hmmmmm interesting that
for the second time riding to the bridge, I fell on
the way there and did not fall on the way back.</p>

<p>While I was there, I talked to the construction
guys a bit; they are installing a drain pipe from the
corner of the street "down to the main trunk" near the
freeway.  I told the guy that I crawled through the
blue tube.  He didn't seem too concerned.  He said it
was a water pipe.  I didn't ask him if it was potable
water or what.</p>

<p>Work was productive in the Getting Rid of Stuff department.  Ever
since I've worked there we have been storing probably 150 cubic feet
of research for the original project that required the grant money
that created the business in the first place.  The project was
government funded, so the documents had to be kept on site for a
certain number of years.  Now they must be kept in government storage
for more years.  That means we get to pack 'em up and move 'em
out!</p>

<p>Erika and Kasi moved boxes and boxes worth of documents out of the
cabinets and into boxes.  Dennis and I moved the empty cabinets out of
the server room to a different part of the office before they are
moved out.</p>

<p>I worked on getting my new computer to act as a web server.  I was
unable to get it to work.  Grrrr at Microsoft.</p>

<p>A great thing, however:  my new GHz computer will now compute an
entire <a href="https://setiathome.berkeley.edu">Seti at Home</a> thing
4 times faster than my other machine, which was taking about 24 hours
per packet.  My linux box is taking about 11 hours per packet.  Now
I'll get tons more finished!</p>

<p>Another great thing is that I got rid of Netscape 6.0 and put
Netscape 4.72 back on my machine.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I-group was great tonight.  It's amazing the magic that happens in
that group every week.</p>

<p class=dream>taking the 45 RPM 7" off the turntable, putting the
<em>Soul II Soul</em> 12" on and slinging it forward to the right
spot, then just moving the needle to the right spot.</p>

<p class=dream>The music played and I watched carefully the label as
it turned to know how far back it must be spun backwards to get the
desired effect.</p>

<p class=dream>"Back to life, back to Reality," and I slung it
backwards, <em>ytilaeRotkcab,efilotkcaB</em> "Back to life, back to
Reality" <em>ytilaeRotkcab,efilotkcaB</em>

<p class=dream>And my friends looked up at me in surprise.  "I have
just barely barely started to tlearn how to scratch," I explained.  I
was afraid I hadn't "done it right" or had scratched maybe an
inappropriate section of music.</p>

<p class=dream>"I don't like the version of ________ where they took
out the long intro," my friend commented.</p>

<p class=dream>"Yeah, and since Bjork died, they really shoudn't have
messed up her song."</p>

<p class=dream>"What??" I exclaimed. "Bjork??? No way!!!"</p>

<p>and I woke up.</p>

<p class=dream>I had a tiny little radio transmitter and a tiny
battery and it was so cool that they could be hooked together to make
a radio!</p>

<p class=dream>On a bus, but I asked my bus driver something and then
got off the bus, and when I tried to get back on the bus, she had
alreday left.  So I got back on a different bus; they were all going
to the same place for a school function, and I just needed to get
there.  The bus driver gave me a little flack: "You can't do anything
or I'll kick you both off."</p>

<p class=dream>"Both?"</p>

<p class=dream>"You <em>and</em> your wife." She indicated the girl
standing beside me (whom I had never seen before; I didn't even know
she was behind me.)</p>

<p class=dream>"Um, okay."  I figured that I'd help out this random
person and let her get on as well without having to plead the bus
driver as I had just done.</p>

<p class=dream>We arrived at our school function place.... something
about people wanting to gohang out somewhere else.. I don't remember
exactly.</p>
