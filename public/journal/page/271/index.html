<p>The bicycle parking lot near our house is a tower thing with a door on the bottom.  Put bicycle in slot, push button, and a gripper thing comes out, takes the bicycle into the elevator, goes up and places it somewhere.    When I come back with my card, the machine remembers where it put my bicycle and retrieves it.  Nice system cause the bicycle stays dry and I don&rsquo;t have to lock it.</p>

<p>The system does have a couple of bugs and some weaknesses, one of them being that the gripper, while strong, is no match for me with fingers playing bicycle tug-of-war.</p>

<p>The bicycle stayed with me, the gripper slipped off the axle, then realized there was a problem when its hands closed down on TJ Bike&rsquo;s front wheel.</p>

<p>Oops.</p>

<p>Lin wasn&rsquo;t very impressed.</p>

<p>I told the guy there&rsquo;s a problem and they were like &ldquo;htf did this happen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Realizing there are cameras, I told them (Lin translated) that I had changed my mind and wanted my bike back because it&rsquo;s a nice day and I could ride to work.</p>

<p>He was like, [in that case, just push this cancel button.]</p>

<p>Chapter learned!  But it reveals another small unconfirmed weakness in the system: if someone leaves before their bicycle goes up, as Lin is wont to do sometimes, can someone else press cancel and get the bike?</p>

<p>Granted the time window is pretty short, but I think I should test that tomorrow.</p>

<p>I made Lin join me playing in the typhoon.  She put on flipflops and a raincoat over her stretchy pants.  I put on a pair of swimming trunks and nothing else, though I did put a towel in our mailbox for our return.</p>

<p>Went to the river and splashed around in the water on the sidewalk.  Rode an abandoned bicycle a bit but left it there because it was happy.</p>

<p>Danced around in the water a bit then went inside.  Hopefully the wind will get stronger tonight so I can go out again!</p>

<p>Today I posted a pic of me with a tiger tail for a moustache on Android chat on Stackoverflow because Graeme wondered what I looked like.  This led to a chat full of win, and I posted a screenshot of it on my wiki.</p>

<p><a href="https://robnugen.com/wiki/Times:2012-june-17_hilarious_moments_in_https://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/15/android">https://robnugen.com/wiki/Times:2012-june-17_hilarious_moments_in_https://chat&hellip;.</a></p>

<p>Therefore I found my wiki entry of Lin,</p>

<p><a href="https://robnugen.com/wiki/Peeps:Lin">https://robnugen.com/wiki/Peeps:Lin</a></p>

<p>and realized I&rsquo;ve not touched my wiki in some time..  So I updated pics of Alex for his 1+ year birthday  <a href="https://robnugen.com/wiki/Peeps:Alex">https://robnugen.com/wiki/Peeps:Alex</a></p>

<p>Lin bought cards for Fred and Ma + Jon&rsquo;s June birthdays; we signed them and I&rsquo;ll post them tomorrow.  I forgot to take pics, but didn&rsquo;t forget to put a bit of cash into Fred&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>At work today I nearly finished cleaning up our core framework for use in the next project, Beach Saiko!!.</p>

<p>At iPhone work today (Chatforest), I am officially stuck trying to get the provisioning keys sorted out.  Gah this is making me crazy.</p>

<p>In other news, I&rsquo;m hopefully close to getting a new MacBook Pro 15 inch retina display with 512GB SSD, 16GB RAM, 2.6GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 CPU.</p>

                        <p>##05:40 Wednesday 30 May 2012</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a weird title I think, but that&rsquo;s what came out through my fingers.</p>

<p>(TL;DR version at the bottom)</p>

<p>For a long time I have thought about what it means to be alive, why we are alive, etc.</p>

<p>At first, around high school age, I determined that emotions are an important part of why we&rsquo;re alive.  For what other reason would emotions become &ldquo;lodged&rdquo; in our bodies until we experience them, unless they&rsquo;re important?</p>

<p>So I therefore determined &ldquo;we are alive in order to feel our emotions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When reading about meditation and doing meditation I cam to a slightly different realization that it&rsquo;s not just about feeling our emotions, but being conscious of everything: every motion, every thought, every step.</p>

<p>This can be best summarized through my rough memories of an exchange between a monk and a .. non-monk?  a regular guy?  is there a word for human that means not yet practicing awareness?</p>

<p>Anyway, the guy was like, &ldquo;so yeah, what is it that you monks do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The monk goes, &ldquo;we eat, we walk, we sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The guy goes, &ldquo;well <em>I</em> eat, and <em>I</em> walk, and <em>I</em> sleep!  what&rsquo;s the difference?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The monk explained, &ldquo;when we eat, we know we are eating.  When we walk, we know we are walking.  And when we sleep, we know we are sleeping.&rdquo;  (*)</p>

<p>When I read that, I was like, &ldquo;o.O&rdquo;</p>

<p>(*) I don&rsquo;t think the one I originally read included sleeping; maybe it was sit, eat, walk.  Adding sleep in there is interesting because some people teach that this life is but a dream during which we are sleeping.</p>

<p>Okay, so the purpose of being alive is experiencing being alive.</p>

<p>On a parallel brain wave, I was thinking about God.  If &ldquo;God is everywhere&rdquo; and &ldquo;God is all powerful&rdquo; then God talks to us all the time, if only we will listen.  I thought this meant that God talks to us through the rustling of leaves, and a glance from a stranger, or the music we hear, etc, etc, etc.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m <em>nearly</em> finished with <em>A New Earth</em> by Eckhart Tolle.  But even before I finish, I want to capture this moment (in case I experience <em>another</em> step in the final few pages of the book) of how the text has tied together the above items in a neat little answer to the question, &ldquo;yeah but why??&rdquo;</p>

<p>Being alive is fine, and experiencing being alive is fine, but why experience being alive?  Oh, this also ties together the suggestions of <em>The Artists Way</em> by Julia Cameron.  She&rsquo;s using some different exercises to get people &ldquo;out of their brains&rdquo; and into automatic writing/painting/living, allowing God to flow through our actions.</p>

<p>Being aware of our actions isn&rsquo;t quite it.  Being aware of the space between our actions is closer.  Being aware of consciousness is close.</p>

<p>God is everywhere = God is in this stapler + God is in this plant + God is in the air I breathe, etc.  That&rsquo;s my ego slicing and dicing bits of things around me and saying &ldquo;yes, God is in that too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>God is in me.  Okay that&rsquo;s closer.</p>

<p>God is me, okay that&rsquo;s closer.</p>

<p>But God&rsquo;s not me; I&rsquo;m a terrible sinner with a mortgage and debt etc etc!  Okay, that&rsquo;s the ego talking; let&rsquo;s get back to awareness.</p>

<p>By being aware of the space within, we are becoming aware of God within.  By placing great attention and care into each thing we do, we allow God to do each thing for us.  Instead of our ego trying to put this here or put that there according to some set of perceived laws or best intentions, allowing awareness to do things allows God to do things through us.</p>

<p>Above is a great mess of words; I&rsquo;m going to try again:</p>

<p>&lt;- - - - tl;dr - - - - &gt; (too long; didn&rsquo;t read)</p>

<p>Being aware while doing things allows God to guide our actions.</p>

<p>&lt;- - - - ts;du - - - - &gt; (too short; don&rsquo;t understand)</p>

<p>Go read <em>A New Earth</em> by Eckhart Tolle.</p>

<p>Sweet!  I stepped barefootedly onto the Tokaido line and saw Michael Q Todd standing right there!  <a href="https://xeeme.com/michaelqtodd">https://xeeme.com/michaelqtodd</a></p>

<p>He&rsquo;s just back from 14 months on The Gold Coast of OZ, and will be finishing his new book soon after doing a speaking tour overseas.</p>

<p>We were both headed to Shinagawa, and I detected some free time in his schedule so suggested he get a hug from AMMA, right across the street from the station.</p>

<p>He said he wasn&rsquo;t surprised at all the synchronicities; I&rsquo;m reading A New Earth by Eckhart Tolle, one of the three books Michael owns: &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a big shift in consciousness that&rsquo;s been accelerating in the past few months.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gave me the idea of Abundance Marketing: do what you love and promote all the people close to your niche who have good products.</p>
