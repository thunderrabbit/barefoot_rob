<p>Middle of installing Debian now.   actually hopefully way past the
middle; overwriting the blank disk with random data took a few hours.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m mostly accepting the defaults when given choices on things.</p>

<p>Headed home from GG lesson in Akihabara. Today we ended up with 7
pages of notes.  And, today was the first time they invited me to ride
the train home with them. Nice! Same line so it&rsquo;s convenient.  I ended
up telling them about KTRU and how much fun it was to DJ there back in
the day.  I have several tapes recorded from my shows; I wonder about
the legality of putting them on soundcloud or something.</p>

<p>Probably illegal; we certainly wouldn&rsquo;t want to promote some
relatively obscure artist, now would we, FCC?</p>

<p>Walking to the station, I spoke to M about journaling, saying the she
should just keep going with old journals and not equate a lapse with
tossing the old journal.</p>

<p>At home now after having purchased a pack of ten DVD-RW disks so I can
overwrite OS X with Ubuntu.  Disk is being burned now.</p>

<h2 id="later">later</h2>

<p>The disk worked fine on the Dell box, but would not boot on my MacBook
Pro.  Fuck that.</p>

<h2 id="17-23pm-next-day">17:23pm next day</h2>

<p>(I need a quick command key to fill in the date!!)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m headed to my GG class, which happens to be in Akihabara.</p>

<p>Though the DVD boots on the Dell, the Dell has no hard drive. So I&rsquo;ve
got it in my backpack and plan to ask a guy in the shop I went to last
week &ldquo;hey man, can you put a hard drive in this thing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked online for a video showing how to replace the HD on this
model laptop but the video is totally different than my laptop.  bah.</p>

<p>It looks like I&rsquo;ll need to pry out the ram to get to the HD cause I
don&rsquo;t see any other easily accessible HD sized slots.</p>

<p>The puter is old so I&rsquo;ll probably just go for like 100GB or something
small-ish かな。。。 depends on price (and everything else of course).</p>

<h2 id="20-44-thursday-21-may-2015">20:44 Thursday 21 May 2015</h2>

<p>Ended up getting a 750GB 5400 rpm drive with a 5 year warranty. Not
bad for 6000 yen.  I&rsquo;m on the train now, but I&rsquo;ll hopefully have
Ubuntu installed on the drive by the end of tonight.</p>

<p>Usually after teaching in Fukuura, I go to Akihabara for Japanese
lesson.  Right now I&rsquo;m headed home from Akihabara; the lesson started
without me 8 minutes ago.  tl;dr version is that I&rsquo;m tired, but a few
little angelic hints have suggested I go home instead:</p>

<ol>
<li>missed by seconds the connection in Yokohama and had to wait 10
minutes</li>
<li>missed by seconds the connection in Tokyo and had to wait 2 minutes</li>
<li>didn&rsquo;t have enough money on my Suica to exit in Akihabara.</li>
</ol>

<p>It was upon this last hint that I was like hmmmm, and flipped a 10 yen
coin, thinking &ldquo;10 = pay money and go to class &hellip; building = go home
and sleeeeep&rdquo;  it landed building face up so I&rsquo;m headed home.</p>

<ol>
<li>Also, my phone battery died, but I think that&rsquo;s more related to me
being tired and not charging it when I had the chance.  Also
related to being tired: I didn&rsquo;t bring the correct textbook to
class today.  Fortunately, they had extras.</li>
</ol>

<p>Okay sleeping now; hopefully I wake up at Kawasaki and not in wherever
this train is headed.</p>

<p>Sigh.</p>

<p>I received an old MacBook on which I&rsquo;d like to install Ubuntu.  Even
upon writing the Ubuntu image file to my usb drive; I got an error
message like &ldquo;this disk cannot be read.&rdquo;  After a bit of searching, it
appears that Apple is trying to disallow people from installing Ubuntu
over OS X.</p>

<p>Bah.</p>

<p>So the suggestion is to burn the Ubuntu iso onto a CD and boot from
that.  But what about newer Macs with no external drive?</p>

<p>柴田さん showed me a new-to-me game at the toy store.  Roll a bunch of
dice and players take turns selecting as many of the same-color /
same-face dice that they wish.  The person who is left with the last
die is the loser.</p>

<p>She was shocked that I hadn&rsquo;t seen the game before!</p>

<p>We also played with the tops, one of which was a round block of wood
with a pencil for its axle.  We spun it and drew patterns remniscent
of spirograph.</p>

<p>AND, they are so great; they kept the train route I had printed last
week and gave it to me this week.</p>

<p>That reminds me, I recently thought of a different way to experience
life, or maybe a different way to frame existence here on earth.</p>

<p>gotta go bye!</p>

<p>Tonight in Japanese class, Tsun sat next to me as Fiona and Melanie
had just joined my table.  I had forgotten his name, but I remember it
now!</p>

<p>Fiona drew two cats on as many pieces of paper.  The styles were quite
different so I asked if she could some more for my friend of friend.
Let&rsquo;s hope good connections are made!</p>
