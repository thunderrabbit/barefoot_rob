<p>Make sure the new user is a shell user at <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=users.users">https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=users.users</a></p>

<p>Create a new ssh key for the new site</p>

<pre><code>ssh-keygen
</code></pre>

<p>Enter the domain as the key filename</p>

<p>Move the keypair to <code>~/.ssh</code></p>

<p>scp the public key to the new machine</p>

<p>ssh into the new machine and move the key to ~/.ssh</p>

<pre><code>mkdir ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
</code></pre>

<p>Move the public key to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys</p>

<pre><code>chmod 400 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
</code></pre>

<p>Make <code>~/.bash_aliases</code> look like this:</p>

<pre><code>alias ls='ls --color=auto'
alias gitd='git diff -b'
alias gitl='git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all'
alias gits='git status'
</code></pre>

<p>Append this to ~/.bash_profile`</p>

<pre><code>if [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then
    . ~/.bash_aliases
fi

EDITOR=/usr/bin/emacs

export EDITOR
</code></pre>

<p>Edit <code>.gitignore</code>:</p>

<pre><code>*~
.cache
logs/
.ssh/
.bash_history
example.com
</code></pre>

<p>Set up git:</p>

<pre><code>git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore
git config --global user.name &quot;Rob Nugen&quot;
git config --global user.email rob@example.com
</code></pre>

<p>Log out of the new machine</p>

<p>On local machine:</p>

<p>Append something like the following to <code>~/.ssh/config</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Host example
    HostName example.com
    User example
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/example.com
</code></pre>

<p>Now ssh into the site:</p>

<pre><code>ssh example
</code></pre>

<p>Enter password for the ssh key and you should be in.</p>

<div class="dream">
In a large city the train was late or otherwise displaced but we
arrived on time on the right hand side of a large building where we had
been.

Everyone was lined up in three lines, waiting for the van to be ready.
I jokingly ran up to be in front of one of the lines in front of a
youth to tease her, but she wasn't phased by my cutting in line. I was
like, "wow I like how Meg (R) didn't even care."  I got out of line as
they started to move forward and get in the van.

Driving in the van in a large muddy area with several youth in the
back, my van was a bicycle and I was driving very carefully so it
wouldn't be bumpy, but I coudln't put my foot down cause I would get
stuck.

As we left, I saw my acquaintence who was a big bald guy who looked
like Michael "Tiny" from SC back at UH I was like "hey man see you
soon; we're gonna hang out cause Spring is coming!" He was like "yeah
let's do it!" or something equally affirmative.

Lin was driving another bicycle but had low air pressure and couldn't
make it up a relatively steep embankment; we were in a crater shaped
bowl of dirt and she couldn't ride up the side wall.  She goes, "can
you help me?" and I was like, "hang on" because I coudln't stop riding
or put my foot down I ended up doing a large slow kickout with my back
tire and hoped everyone inside the van was okay.

<p>Yoshie may introduce a friend for lessons with me.  Yay!</p>

<p>Mutsumi recently asked if I could create a vector pattern, and I spent
some time looking at
<a href="https://weaving-tool.appspot.com/maker/">weaving software</a>
<a href="www.weavemaker.com/downloads/">packages</a>&hellip; but it appears that it
will require more conventional image software..  I plan to use
<a href="https://www.mapdiva.com/products-page/">Artboard</a>, which I&rsquo;ve had for
a while but not really used (nor registered).  This project would give
me an excuse to do both!</p>

<p>I got my repos sorted today; all the journal entries have had
frontmatter lobotomies if Middleman can&rsquo;t deal with the different
dates, and my main Middleman repo includes the journal entry repo as a
submodule.</p>

<p>However, turns out netlify doesn&rsquo;t clone recursively (yet).  I
mentioned this to Mathias and he was like, &ldquo;hmm you&rsquo;re right&rdquo; and said
he would look into it.  But, he said politely, he was planning to go
home for the night and didn&rsquo;t want to push any possibly-breaking
changes before going to bed.</p>

<p>HAHhahaa most def.  We&rsquo;ll see if they get it sorted out soon!  Then
I&rsquo;ll have a temporary space for journals before I figure out how
Middleman does deploys natively, decide what URL to use (hakyll?  but
it&rsquo;s not Hakyll anymore&hellip; hmmm), and set it all up.</p>

<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll go with new.robnugen.com until it&rsquo;s a site that can take
over for all the crap on robnugen.com now (fat chance?) then kill
robnugen.com as I switch new.robnugen.com to www.robnugen.com.  Damn
what a lot of <del>broken links</del> <ins>redirects</ins> I have
planned!</p>

<p>Slightly different than other todo lists I&rsquo;ve made, I will put time
limits on items today, during which I currently have 6 hours
available:</p>

<ol>
<li><del>check illustrations (1 hour)</del></li>
<li><del>get Redmine to send emails (1 hour)</del></li>
<li><del>create invoice from Redmine (1 hour)</del></li>
<li><del>try to fix journal entries so unadulterated Middleman can use them (1 hour)</del></li>
</ol>

<p>If I had a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">tomato timer</a>, I&rsquo;d
count off 15 minute increments with it.  For now I&rsquo;ll use my phone.

<p>#15:47</p>

<p>Took a bit more than an hour, but it looks like I&rsquo;ve gotten my journal
entries tweaked for Middleman (&rsquo;s glaring oversite?) regarding dates.</p>

<p>Basically, Middleman throws an exception if it encounters a date in
the frontmatter that differs than the date encoded in the file&rsquo;s path.</p>

<p>So if my file /2015/12/05monkey.md has a date of 1am December 6th, Middleman will barf.</p>

<p>Not only that, but Middleman can only handle one timezone for alllll
the entries, even though I&rsquo;ve written entries and dated them while in
different timezones.  Bah.</p>

<p>BUT, Middleman was quite quick, so I adjusted my journal entries for
its sake.  The frontmatter dates don&rsquo;t matter (ahem) to me as much as
the file path dates and the dates actually written in the entries
themselves.</p>

<p>Wow first entry in March.  I wonder why, but it seems I often miss the first day(s) of months.</p>

<p>Worked on stuff for Nate yesterday on new redmine installation, makin&rsquo;
it all customized and nearly getting emails working.  The server can
send them from command line, and Redmine says its email is set up, but
maybe it doesn&rsquo;t check past &ldquo;is there a configuration file&rdquo; (i.e. I
set it up rhong)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been studying a bit of Japanese (kanji) with the app

<p>I finished my
<a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/live-md5-command-line-cheater">livemd5 cheater</a>;
it went more smoothly than I expected!</p>

<p>In just tens of seconds it can spew hundreds of strings with md5 (hex)
hashes which regex match any three digits at the end of the string
e.g. /123$/</p>

<p>Too bad everyone else has nearly abandoned the

<p>I&rsquo;m not really going mad, but I realize the code I am trying to write
for the MD5 count thing is like a madlib.  I want to take a string and
replace tokens with example words.</p>

<p>Only difference: I want to do a combination of <em>all</em> the options.
Essentially</p>

<pre><code>foreach adjective in my list of adjectives:
    for each noun in my list of nouns:
        fill in the adjective and noun in template
</code></pre>

<p>So I end up with length-adjectives * length-nouns sentences, each of
which I will md5 and see if it can work for the next MD5 count.</p>

<p>I was thinking of using <code>map</code> to map my template from the list of
adjectives, but then essentially I have a shitton of memory being
used.  I don&rsquo;t need to keep <em>any</em> of the strings in memory; just check
each one and poop it out if it&rsquo;s good.</p>

<p>So far, I&rsquo;m able to split the input string into an array on the tokens
and keep the tokens cause I need to fill them in later:</p>

<pre><code>my %files = (
    'ADJECTIVE' =&gt; 'adjectives.txt',
    'NOUN'  =&gt; 'nouns.txt',
    'VERB'  =&gt; 'verbs.txt'
);

my @replaceable_tokens = keys %files;

# Will be 'ADJECTIVE|NOUN|VERB' for use in split regex
my $replaceable_tokens_ORed = join('|',@replaceable_tokens);        

# grab two unnamed command line parameters
my ($string, $target) = @ARGV;      

# tokenize the input string while keeping tokens
my @tokenized_string = split(/($replaceable_tokens_ORed)/, $string);
</code></pre>

<p>Next I will make a variable for each of the tokens which will act as a
counter for the corresponding list of words.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t yet have a smart way to loop through a variable number of
loops, though I think that will have to come next.</p>
