<p class="note">(transcribed from Book Six 4:02pm JST Friday 26 June 2009 (day 14338))</p>

<p class="date">1:30 AM Sunday 21 November 1993 (Day 58)</p>

<p>&quot;Today&quot; I took dad &amp; Caryl to <del>the airp</del> <ins>Hobby Airport</ins>.  Dad
gave me a bunch of software - Norton Utilities 7.0, Visual Basic, Harvard Graphics, Flight
Simulator 5.0, <ins>and OS/2</ins> and more.  I installed Norton &amp; Visual Basic.  The screen
went blank during my Visual Basic installation, but I kept pressing return and it installed itself
apparently to default values.  Cool.</p>

<p>I did Castle of Dreams for 5 hours.  I uploaded a good message addition to the food fight by
spraying a fine mist of peach nectar everywhere, thinking that Darius had yelled &quot;juice!&quot;
when he yelled, &quot;Truce!&quot;  Heh.</p>

<p>I also <del>built</del> <ins>compiled</ins> parts of me &amp; Scout's RIGHT!!! Handshake &amp;
got that put together.</p>

<p>Then Darius was a jerk acting toward Magic, a new user.  I explained to Darius the way things
are.  I'm going to get mad at him if he doesn't cool it.</p>

<p>I did my dishes &amp; got my budget caught up.</p>

<p>I called Cathy &amp; left a message for her to call me.</p>

<p>Then I cruised to Ultimate Frisbee and the ground was muddy.  Muddy &amp; wet.  Today was the
first day I've ever worn shoes at Ultimate.  I wore McCleod's, and they were great.  He'll sell
them to me for 5 bucks.</p>

<p class="date">10:20 AM Same day Sunday 21 Nov 93 (Day 58)</p>

<p>Wearing shoes in Ultimate really helped.  I may do that more often.  McCleud [sic] had a camera
and we got before &amp; after pictures of those who played.  Cool.</p>

<p class="date">12:15 AM Saturday 20 November 1993 November 1993 (Day 57)</p>

<p>&quot;Today&quot; I slept till <del>noon</del> <ins>11</ins> &amp; then farted around till I
went to school to take Sara to work.  I saw Diana out by PGH.  She was en route to pick up her
test.  She got it and then came back by.  I inquired about her grade but she wouldn't show me.  I
asked, &quot;do you have a boyfriend?&quot;  &quot;No.&quot;  Dude!  &quot;I'll give you a kiss for
each point you got on your test.&quot;  She got 8 (out of 20).  No more was said about kisses, but
we hugged big and she cruised.</p>

<p>Sara was with a girl named Gwen.  We went to Sara's house where we kissed a little, but she had
to quit because (I think) she couldn't handle it emotionally.</p>

<p>We drove her to work and then I went to SPB to see Cathy.  I hugged her and talked to her
briefly. Then she had to cruise.</p>

<p>I went to Comp Sci Library and farted around with graphics; I didn't get anything done.</p>

<p>Cruised home &amp; read the database chapter on SQL. Sigh.  Fuck.  Shit.  Here come database
again.</p>

<p>I played with Suzanne some.  She gave me bread.  Later.</p>

<p class="date">11:15 AM Friday 19 November 1993 (Day 56)</p>

<p>Skating was bad ass yesterday.  I first went to Christine's.  This is the first time that I have
seen or talked to her since the day she moved in below me.  (She moved out a couple days later to
1203(?) W Gray.)  She didn't go; I didn't expect her to but I wanted to see her.</p>

<p>I skated to downtown &amp; found some dudes playing frisbee in the bank drive-through of First
City Bank (I think).  That's by the &quot;Kellogg&quot; parking garage.  We played disc for a while
&amp; then did Kellogg garage twice.  Then me &amp; a dude named Ed, who was wearing a jester
looking hat and had a cute girlfriend wearing an oversized purple Jamaican hat went to a garage
called First City which is near The Park Shops.  We skated back &amp; met everyone and then we all
skated to &quot;321&quot;, the address of a bar on Richmond near Bagby.  I got some water &amp;
hung out for a bit &amp; then I cruised.  Alone, I skated back to the original spot where I saw
more skaters.  I joined them &amp; it was Beth &amp; Carrie (sp) and some dudes all who I met at
4th of July at Allen Parkway.</p>

<p>Beth has braces now. I am certain that she didn't back then.  I talked to her &amp; a dude named
Chris for a bit.  They looked somewhat together, thought.  I saw two people skating up the Kellogg
garage, so I took that opportunity to say 'see ya' to Beth.</p>

<p>It was Heather &amp; a dude maybe named Chris.  I joined them &amp; Chris wanted to race me down
the garage.  Heather didn't want to go down.  We raced &amp; Chris won, though I found out later
that he's a pussy because he can't turn right down a garage.  Pussy.</p>

<p>We did the garage again &amp; Heather was at the bottom this time.  Her wheel was fucked up so I
told them 'See ya' when Carrie &amp; some dude skated by.  They were going to Brewery Tap.  I
skated with them until we got to Party on the Plaza, where I did the stairs once &amp; one of the
tallest ramps there.  It was the ramp that I was too afraid to go down when I first went there.
Bad ass.  I cruised to Brewery Tap &amp; got some water &amp; sat with Carrie &amp; whoever it
was.  I cruised after a while &amp; skated to the Chronicle to watch the newspaper printers.  I
skated home &amp; got back at 1:20 AM.</p>

<p>Suzanne had requested hot tea to fix her throat so I brought some down to her.  I told her my
story &amp; subsequently fell asleep on her couch until 7AM this morning.  I cruised to my bed
&amp; slept &amp; now here I am.</p>

<p class="date">1:25AM Thursday 18 November 1993 (Day 55)</p>

<p>Tammy's birthday is today.</p>

<p>&quot;Today&quot; I joking told Maggie, &quot;I'm not going to Automata today.&quot; She
accepted my decision and we hung out at her house &amp; she gave me a wonder back &amp; body
massage and worked on my ears &amp; it was fantastic.</p>

<p>We talked a lot about Cathy and my relationship in general right now.</p>

<p>Weather wise today was beautiful.</p>

<p>We went to school in time for Maggie's 2:30 racquetball class.  On the way across campus, we saw
Diana, who was watching a squirrel &amp; stuff.  I accidentally scared the squirrel though; I didn't
know it was there.</p>

<p>I hugged Diana really big &amp; talked to her at length.  We discussed growing up &amp; older
&amp; nothing.  Cool.</p>

<p>I cruised to computer scince [sic] library &amp; worked on graphics on X_Windows.  I didn't
quite get it working but I think (hope) that's cause I didn't have the correct input data.</p>

<p>I turned in my petition for writing proficiency waiver thing.</p>

<p>I strolled into database late as usual.</p>

<p>Database lab was held in the terminal room and we worked on SQLforms.</p>

<p>We filled out evaluations for Eva and I wrote in the comment section that she is really
beautiful and I want to kiss her.  (Now it's 2:45 AM)</p>

<p>While Eva was out of the room, I cracked everyone up by doing my impression of Dr
Eick. &quot;Okay let's say we have an employee named Miller and we want to change the name of the
company to Miller...&quot; He uses the name Miller for everything.  And his thick German accent
pronounces it like Millah.  It's hilarious.  and <em>I</em> was hilarious; the whole class cracked
up.</p>

<p>I went to Molly's room on my way off campus and then by Britt's room.</p>

<p>At home, Suzanne gave me a Fucking Bad Ass article about a Fresh Kick Ass roller coaster called
Kumba in Tampa Florida.  It is 3978 feet long with 7 loops.</p>

<p>The initial incline pass through on of the loops.  Fucking Bad Ass.  i will ride it.</p>

<p>I WILL RIDE IT.</p>

<p>I got around to working on graphics and holy shit the problem of Stereo Projection is suddenly
way harder than I expected.  I had to rethink a lot of how I did my functions.  However, I
carefully top down designed the changes I would have to make and as I talked to Cathy on the phone,
I implemented them.</p>

<p>I have to basically carry around an extra global matrix just in case we have the stereo
projection to do.  And then I have to be prepared to buid [sic] not one, but two new objects if
it's a stereo projection.  The object builder has to keep asking &quot;are we doing stereo?&quot;
&quot;do I need to do this twice?&quot;  The code is a big ugly patch across the beautiful tight
code I had before.</p>

<p>Cathy and I talked about stuff and how we're doing &amp; everything.  She does not have a
boyfriend, and she is independent &quot;almost to a fault.&quot;  I told her that I talked to
Maggie about her at length.  I balked a bit when I began to tell her that she is meeting the
&quot;qualifications for my ideal partner&quot; list.</p>

<p>Intrigued, she asked me to get it and we went through it.  The only ones she doesn't totally fit
are those that are not amazingly important to me.  We got to the point that we agreed there is an
attraction between us.  I think I may be more attracted to her than she is to me.  I don't know if
that makes her more attractive...</p>

<p>I did realize that if there was another guy like me also interested in her then I would be much
more likely to strive for her favor.  I specifically did not ask her about the existance [sic] of
such a guy.</p>

<p>At 1AM or so she let me go.  I typed in all the final changes to my program and.... The only
errors were a few logical errors.  EXCELLENT!!!</p>

<p>I was like BAD ASS!  You are bad Ass, Rob!  Dude!  It works it works it works.</p>

<p>Then at about 2AM as I was writing in here, I heard my computer beep.  Marcel had set [sic] me a
Talk request.  After working 12 hours straight on his program, he was having a hard time of it.  I
watched him bitch about it and he got that out of his system &amp; was left with dispair [sic].
&quot;What to do?&quot; There was a stupid error he was having with his program.</p>

<p>I told him to mail it to me and I compiled it and debugged it and after a few tries, I found the
error.  Simple - one of his lines of code had been deleted and the value of one variable was not
being initialized.  I found it.</p>

<p>Marcel has saved my ass on programs so many times that I was thankful to be able to return the
favor.  Cool.  Cool.  Cool.</p>

<p>I expect him to try to Talk to me again in a bit to see how it worked out.</p>

<p>That's everything.  I'm heading for bed.</p>

<p class="date">1:20AM Wednesday 17 November 1993 (Day 54)</p>

<p>&quot;Today&quot; there were tornadoes &amp; shit downtown &amp; flooding across the city.
Fortunately, none of my shit got fucked up, and most of the rain was over by the time I left.</p>

<p>There was a 30 (thirty) car accident on I45 South <del>toward</del> <ins>near</ins> Galveston.
Fuck.</p>

<p>Maggie &amp; I got pictures of the Enron Building, which lost several windows, and a <del>bill
b</del> billboard that &quot;exploded&quot; according to an eyewitness.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I did not get a picture of Memorial Drive flooded in one ara near Shepherd.</p>

<p>In graphics, the weather got really really dark &amp; windy &amp; rainy again.  Also, I took an
opportunity to insult the guy was is using Visual Baisc to do the graphics project.</p>

<p>Marcel, Molly, Maggie, &amp; I joined Steve for lunch &amp; Katy (cute girl, Caleb's friend, does
lots of e-mail &amp; internet stuff) &amp; Dave (Sabita's boyfriend) joined us.  Cool.  We
talked <del>about</del> sex jokes &amp; computer jokes.</p>

<p>In gymnastics, I spotted Laura doing some cartwheels on the beam.  That was really cool because
she usually seems to never want to interact with me. I enjoyed it.</p>

<p>I straddled my legs around Candy (facing her) &amp; talked to her briefly at the end of
class.</p>

<p>I went to Moly's &amp; when Lisa came in, I told her, &quot;Lisa, I have decided to quit bugging
you.  I will be your friend but I will not try to kiss you anymore.  You are obviously not as
infatuated with me as I am with you.&quot; &quot;I don't know how to respond.&quot;</p>

<p>Molly &amp; I both said, &quot;Just say, 'Thank you.'&quot;  I seriously doubt that I embarassed
her or hurt her pride, but I hope I didn't.</p>

<p>I went to Britt's room and hugged her and she was a bit more huggy than usual.  We talked for 30
minutes and discussed our futures and roller coasters and dolphins.  She is having some trouble
with her relationship with Scott and that was part of the reason she was down, but mostly,
&quot;discontent&quot; with her life in general.  I gave her many hugs to make her feel better.</p>

<p>I got home &amp; was in a big cleaning mood &amp; I cleaned &amp; mostly reorganized my whole
apartment.  I built the plexiglass shelf that's holding my Dr Dobb's magazines.</p>

<p>I got a meeting scheduled for Dr Barth to join the EAG meeting next Monday.</p>

<p>I called Cathy &amp; her sister Linda answered &amp; said they might come over later tonight.
They did.  At midnight, Cathy, Linda &amp; Alex &amp; Vivian came over.  Alex &amp; Vivian cruised
pretty quickly; to my pleasure, Cathy &amp; Linda stayed for a while.  They (Cathy) are great!</p>

<p>Cathy wants a big Rotweiler, they like my music : nin, House of Pain, 10000 maniacs, Siouxie
&amp; the Banshees, Green Jelly, Enya, U2, Cypress Hill, Book of Love ... Bad Ass!</p>

<p>They checked out my graphics project &amp; they were quite impressed &amp; Cathy liked my room
decorations and she wants to put her handprint on the wall as well.  Cool.  <del>Linda</del></p>

<p>Linda asked, &quot;so what else col do you have to show us?&quot; So I showed them my marble
track.  They loved it.  They renamed it my Marble Maze.</p>

<p>I was continually giving Cathy shoulder rubs &amp; back scratch &amp; back rub &amp; at one
point while we were exchanging stories in my dining room, I was standing behind her and she wrapped
my arms around her front as she held my hands.  Wonderful.  Wonderful. Wonderful.  I loved it.</p>

<p>Happily, (except for school &amp; other obligations) they kept delaying their departure as we
talked.  I kept holding Cathy and giving her occasional kisses <del>abov</del> on or above her
ear.</p>

<p>I walked them outside &amp; hugged Cathy on the balcony &amp; at her car.  During our last hug,
she kissed me on the cheek.  I <del>was</del> am ecstatic.  I love it.  I love it.</p>

<p>We will see what happens.</p>

<p class="date">1:35 AM Tuesday 16 November 1993 (Day 53)</p>

<p>&quot;Today&quot; I remained awake through Automata.</p>

<p>I was late to database, but I got <del>some</del> my doubly linked list sorting algorithm
done.</p>

<p>Fairly soon after I announced to Molly &amp; Sabita &amp; Dave that I was not going to chase
Lisa anymore, she came in with Jason, her &quot;interest.&quot;  I was glad I had just &quot;turned
her down&quot; before I was non verbally essentially dissed when they walked in.</p>

<p>On the way out through OB, I hugged Janice, Jeanine, &amp; Diana all in sequence while they were
in line at Late night.  I showed Diana that I still had Catwoman that she gave me out of her Happy
Meal a few weeks ago.  I gave her a kiss on the hair when I hugged her again.  Jeanine got me a
Hawaiian Punch &amp; Janice disappeared. I think Diana's number is 7270.</p>

<p>I tutored Heather for 2 hours.  She owed me 10 bucks alrady, so I got 30 plus a dollar tip.  Bad
Ass.</p>

<p>My graphics project kicks butt.  It's almost done.</p>

<p>Later.</p>

<p class="date">1:43 AM Monday 15 November 1993 (Day 52)</p>

<p>&quot;Today&quot; while I was working on my graphics, Laura O showed up looking like a drowned
rat.  I took her in &amp; dried her off &amp; gave her clean clothes &amp; hopped in bed with her
to warm her up.</p>

<p>She syaed for about 5 or 7 hours probably, while I worked on <del>datab</del> graphics &amp; we
napped &amp; ate pancakes &amp; had a good time.</p>

<p>I'm getting my graphics done kick ass.  I have all the projections done &amp; the hidden
surfaces are not drawn.  The visible suraces are drawn in an arbitrary order though.</p>

<p>I watched _Orchid II_ with Suzanne &amp; then we engaged in mutual oral sex but we didn't
actually have sex.  I think we did more than I'll be happy with in the morning.  I won't do it
again.</p>

<p>Cathy, the cutie from SPB called.  I will call her tomorrow since I was too late to call her
tonight.  Dagnabbit.</p>

<p>Maybe she'll be my girlfriend.  We'll see.</p>

<p class="date">4:35AM Sunday 14 November 1993 (Day 51)</p>

<p>Yesterday I worked on graphics all day and I got excellent work done.  I have rewritten the
entire project and got the thing working as it should have for the first project.  It now uses
doubly linked lists everywhere and the code overall is much more flexible &amp; more tightly &amp;
consistently written.</p>

<p>Molly came over for a while yesterday and worked on Numerical Methods &amp; napped in my blue
recliner.</p>

<p>My project is really kick butt now.  The object names are like &quot;dave&quot; &amp;
&quot;molly&quot; instead of 1 &amp; 2.</p>

<p>I am really pleased.  Oh- and it is not restricted to objects with <del>a certain</del> the same
number of points in each face.  So I can have objects like</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/File:Page_5_Book_Six_snippet_November_1993.jpg"><img src="/w/images/thumb/a/a1/Page_5_Book_Six_snippet_November_1993.jpg/120px-Page_5_Book_Six_snippet_November_1993.jpg"
alt="shapes for graphics" /></a>
<p>with no problem.  Very cool.</p>

<p>I did Castle of Dreams stuff for a couple hours.  Scout told me there are 188 Billion ways the
first 4 moves (4 by black 4 by white) of a chess game can occur.  1 X 10^116 ways a 40 move game can
occur.  Dude.</p>

<p>I would like to be able to play chess.</p>

<p>There is a giant food fight going on in the Castle and Elsbeth asked me my ral name.</p>

<p>Jack Dracula is hanging out with us and is his old self again.  And Tammy is back as The
Hobbit.</p>

<p>Christine &amp; Suzanne came over and we talked and had a standing tickle fight in the hall.  We
were friends and that was cool.</p>

<p>I slept then woke up at 4:35 AM in a fit of coughing.  I'm kinda sick. Bleah.</p>
