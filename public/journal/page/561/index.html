<p class=date>3:50pm CST Saturday 3 March 2001</p></p>

<p>Much to Wende's pleasant surprise, and my surprise as well, I
vacuumed the whole house this morning!  After that we had breakfast
tacos custom made by Wende and we just went on an errand spree to the
post office and to get Scott's oil changed and to get the 1.25 inch
machine screws to attach hand-painted (by me at Mad Potter last week)
ceramic handles to our CD drawers.</p>

<p>We got home and <em>yay!</em>, our pictures from Australia arrived
from the developers!  And... our garage door was left open.  Doh!!</p>

<p>I'm thankful that everything seems to be in place.</p>

<p>This evening Wende and I will be at KTRU from 7 to 9pm.  But there
is a ball game being broadcast from 5-8pm.  I'll call the 5-7pm DJ to
see what is up.</p>

<p class=date>11:40pm CST Friday 2 March 2001</p></p>

<p>Tonight I am working on my awesomely awesome cool huge project at
work, but I'm working on it from home through the VPN.  That is
totally killa awesome.  This project is going to blow away all the
other projects I've seen at our work.  Really.</p>

<p>It just started raining pretty thoroughly, which inspired me to
make a note here.</p>

<p>"Today" at work we moved 200 boxes out of our
office.  They stored a ton of research data from the
original project that started this company.  The data
has been collected and reports written.  But because
it was funded through a government grant, all the data
has to be kept available for like 7 years.  We are
just keeping it available somewhere else.</p>

<p>Also, because emacs rules, I used emacs to edit
about 20 source files at once.  I needed to revamp all
of them to fit the structure of the new latest and
greatest hugest SAS project I have ever written!  With
these 20 source files, we will be able to host an
unlimited number of 360-feedback surveys, each with
unique questions, each with multiple classes and
raters and administrator screens to let them update
username records and classes and stuff!</p>

<p>Once this project is finished, I will have written
two incredibly awesome incredibly generic sets of code
that can run the two basic types of surveys that we
host (organizational health and 360 feedback).</p>

<p>The next big step may be to combine the similar
parts of these projects into even more generic slicker
cooler things.</p>

<p>Investment club was cool today; Wende's friend
Julie attended as an interested party who may join
next month!</p>

<p>I chatted online with Eddie who couldn't make it to
the meeting, and everyone presented stocks they had
researched.  We discussed making adjustments to how
often we research different industries - so that we
will synchronize our research within different
industries to the times that Value Line.</p>

<p>I handed out K-1s to each member present and I
imagine I'll just give the rest out to peeps if they
come to the April meeting.  I'll write an email to say
"come and get it!!"</p>

<p>Awww yeah.</p>

<p>At work, we are now on T1, baby.</p>

<p>Getting it installed and functioning was more
difficult than it should have been.  Anti-thanks to
the guy who said he couldn't help more because the
router is pro-connect (we have password) and not
pro-managed (they have password).</p>

<p>Super duper thanks to David who took the time to
figure out what was the situation on our end and asked
a smart tech guy how to solve it.</p>

<p>Super duper incredible thanks to John who fixed it,
and then tracked down another problem after the first
fix didn't actually fix it.  So awesome!  I will write
a happy letter to his boss!</p>

<p>I'm writing this entry now from work over our new
T1 connection.  Whoo hoo!!!</p>

<h1>State Of My e-Life</h1>

<p>(In no specific order)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Tomorrow morning at work we will switch our Internet line from
DSL to T1.  I hope it goes well.</p></li>

<li><p>Today at work I have just been commissioned to expand the G3
project I had been working on before visiting Australia.  I basically
have 2 weeks to do it.  It will probably take a lot of time, and I'm
looking forward to producing an excellent product for us.</p></li>

<li><p>This week at home I have gotten VPN connectivity from my Win NT
box to work.  Nice.  I will probably therefore be able to do a lot of
work from home.</p></li>

<li><p>Our Australia pictures have been scanned an are available at
photoworks.com.  I am putting them into an electronic album which I
will make available from here.  I still intend to copy most of the to
my geocities site and link them from my journal; we'll see how happy I
am with the way the albums work on photoworks.</p></li>

<li><p>I have a few journal entries written on my Handspring Visor,
but I just haven't moved them to my site yet.  They are from this
weekend.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been pretty impressed lately with <a
href="https://www.yahoo.com">yahoo!</a> and <a
href="https://www.google.com">google.com</a>.  Yahoo! not for its
search engine, but for all the other services that they have pretty
seamlessly rolled into a nice huge ball.  Google for its search engine
and <em>caching</em> of every webpage it indexes!</p></li>

<p class=date>11:23pm CST Tuesday 27 February 2001</p></p>

<p>Though Wende and I didn't specifically study/practice spanish in
Australia, we did pretty well in our class tonight, considering we had
missed two weeks of classes kinda.  We entirely missed the class on
the verb "ser," but she reviewed that today and went over the verb
"estar."  We didn't just repetitively conjugate the verbs a million
times, but instead used them in sentences with a bunch of different
adjectives, all of which have flittered from my mind.</p>

<p>Except
<br><em>arriba</em> means "high"
<br><em>abajo(a)</em> means "low"
<br><em>triste</em> means "sad"
<br><em>feliz</em> means "happy"
<br><em>cosado(a)</em> means "married"
<br><em>consado(a)</em> means "tired"
<br><em>largo(a)</em> means "long"
<br><em>corto(a)</em> means "short" (length)
<br><em>alto(a)</em> means "tall"
<br><em>bajo(a)</em> means "short" (height)
<br><em>burracho(a)</em> means "drunk"
<br><em>mojado(a)</em> means "wet"
<br><em>caliente</em> means "hot"
<br><em>frio(a)</em> means "cold"
<br><em>caro(a)</em> means "expensive"
<br><em>pobre</em> means "poor"
<br><em>sentado(a)</em> means "sitting"
<br><em>rapido(a)</em> means "fast"
<br><em>facil</em> means "easy"</p>

<p>Please don't assume any of the above are correct.</p>

<p>We really should make some flashcards for these.</p>

<p>I have started 3 days earlier than usual at getting stuff ready for
investment club meeting on Thursday!  I ordered software to help with
our end-of-year taxes, and had them overnighted to me so I can install
them and use them tomorrow so I can hand out K-1 forms to everyone in
the club on Thursday.</p>

<p>Today I worked on investment club stuff; reading about end of year
tax filing requirements etcetera.  Since I'm the treasurer, it helps
if I know these things.</p>

<p>I looked up a few companies' annual reports, but didn't enter any
data into the SSG (Stock Selection Guide).</p>

<p>Then to Wende's work via Taco Bell, bringing her lunch to munch,
and we had some chocolate cake because yesterday was her 29th
birthday!</p>

<p>Then to YRUU in the Woodlands where they talked about plans for
their show on 23 March.  It will be more emo and less punk than the
last show they hosted.  I don't remember all the band names, or even
any of them really.</p>

<p>Back toward home, listening to Billy Graham on 105.7 KHCB.  I
listen to KHCB each Sunday because KTRU plays jazz all day on Sunday.
Bluh.</p>

<p>More investment club stuff and then set up the phone-sync software
for my phone.  Then it was time for Youth Follies at Emerson Church. </p>

<p>Youth Follies is a skit/performance/show type fundraiser that the
youth group at Emerson puts on each year.  Parents donate time and $
to make spaghetti dinner and then everyone else pays $ to youth group
for dinner and the junior high wait the tables.  Jr high group gets
all the tips.</p>

<p>This year was unique for me because I was not involved with any
part of the planning.  I just watched the show.  Actually I was given
a part in the show when I bought my ticket.  I got to be a contestant
on <em>Who Wants To Be A Millionaire</em> spoof they did.  Pretty
funny stuff.</p>

<p>Super cool is that Phat Pat, Heidi and kT all came to watch the
show, <em>and</em> Joan came in from Austin to swing dance with David
in the show!  So fabulous!</p>

<p>I thought the funniest skit was "Attack of the Deranged Mutant
Killer Couch," in which the old stinky couch came to life in someone's
dream and tried to assimilate her and then when she woke up, it was
there for real.  Totally Elm Street stuff.</p>

<p>Great show, and a lot longer than last year's I believe.  1.5 hours
including the intermission skit done by the junior high in which they
spoofed the wack presidential election from last fall.  Very funny.

<pre>
"Mr Bush, what is your favorite Texas City?"

"Kilgore."

"Mr Gore, what is your favorite story from the bible?"

"The one with the burning bush."
</pre>

<p>After the show, I talked to Pat and Alison while people cleaned up
the room around us.  We were pretty much in the way so we moved after
Denise brought that fact to our attention.</p>

<p>Ate a couple more ice cream sandwiches while Pat described his
theory that he and I are both twins derived from Peter Pan in Never
Never Land, and his experience at the 22,000 youth PAL rally last
weekend.  Big fun stuff!</p>

<p>Now it's time for B-E-D bed.</p>
