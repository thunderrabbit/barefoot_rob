                        <h1>DECISIONS</h1>

<p><p>As I begin this project of transferring my website to this new domain, I&rsquo;ve had to make a few decisions.</p>

<ul>
<p><li>To preserve and honor the past I will not change the color or style of old journal entries (before 1999).

<p><li>old journal entries should also stay as navigationally untampered as possible.  
<br>In pre 1998 journal directories:
  <br><ul>
  <li>index.html will have a link to /journal/index.pl
  <li>all other files will simply point back to their own index.html, and no further back than that.
  </ul>

<p><p><li>index.pl will be designed to only index new and future stuff.  This way it will be easier to write current stuff, and I won&rsquo;t have to spend a lot of time retrofitting old stuff.</p>

<p><p><li>Everything below /journal dir is visible except index.pl</p>

<p></ul></p>

<p><p>I will add to the list as needed.  It will just be sort of a record to help me with this process.</p>

<h1>Just to see</h1>

<p><p>Today I had a most awesome day at work.  I greeted everyone with my FSD Data Services plate (I painted our logo on a plate at Mad Potter) and everyone oohed and ahhed in a most pleasing way.  I ate 3 sandwiches from it today!</p>

<p><p>In addition to eating sandwiches, I faxed in our request for DSL to Savvis Communications!  This is a great and wonderful thing because it represents the culmination of a significant amount of research and planning to find the right DSL provider for us.  We (I) chose Savvis because they have killer awesome customer service, guarantees on Uptime, guarantees on installation time, and nice price.  Unlimited free IP addresses.  They ping our router every 90 seconds to make sure it&rsquo;s awake.  Good stuff.  Oh, and they are the ISP for the ISP that hosts www.robnugen.com.  Nice.</p>

<p><p>In addition to faxing the request, I got a lot done on my current HTML project for work.  I may have mentioned it before; the goal is to use cookies to save information on a users local machine (using a browser while OFFline (not on Internet) while they&rsquo;re on a plane or beach somewhere), and then allowing them to submit that data to us once they are back online.</p>

<p><p>I dug through my code trying to see where to add a nicety and I noticed that I had gotten a bit sloppy with my 3 tier architecture (HI Maggie and Phil).  I sketched out a version of what the 3 tiers should be, and was able to knead my functions back in shape nicely.  (Marcel, this next part is for you)  I made the changes to code (moved 3 lines and added about 6 or 8 lines sprinkled throughout, changed 2 functions&rsquo; input parameters, changed their corresponding function calls), and it worked.  No syntax errors.  No logic errors.</p>

<p><p>AWESOME, BAAABYY!!!!!!!</p>

<p><p>Okay, so now I&rsquo;m about to go to Mad Potter again to show off my plate and say HI to (flirt with) some of my friends.</p>

                        <p>7:20am</p>

<p>I wanted to name this file awesome!!!!!!!.txt but I don&rsquo;t think the
exclamation points would have been very well received by the shell.  I
don&rsquo;t actually know.</p>

<p>Awesome!!!!  I have written my index.pl file, which sits in my
/journal directory.  It accepts arguments on the URL: dir= and file=
to indicate which directory and file to display!!!  As Dude might say,
it&rsquo;s &ldquo;totally supa cold dope rawkin!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So now I simply use a Cascading Style Sheet in my index.pl file (I may
eventually move the style sheet to its own file as it gets more
complex) and it gives a more consistent look to my journal entries!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty flippin&rsquo; pumped about the whole thing!</p>

<p>I still want to add a bit of security to the whole thing; make sure
people don&rsquo;t try to enter huge crazy long directory paths and/or file
names to try to break the server.  I think Perl will simply fail and
there won&rsquo;t be a security breach, but I&rsquo;ll add it anyway.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already added code that ensures no &lsquo;.&rsquo; &lsquo;/&rsquo; or &lsquo;~&rsquo; characters are
used at the beginning of the diretory name, so one can&rsquo;t dig into my
directory structure with this file.  Oh wait!!!  One could do this:
index.pl?dir=1999/../../  I&rsquo;ll try that now and see what happens.
Doh!</p>

<p>Oh my goodness!  I was able to type in
index.pl?dir=1999/../../../../../../../etc/ and get a listing of the
/etc dir on this server!!!!  As proof, here&rsquo;s a list of some of the
files in it:</p>

<p>cron.daily
 cron.half-hourly
 cron.hourly
 cron.monthly
 cron.quarter-daily
 cron.quarter-hourly
 cron.weekly</p>

<p>Is this a security breach?  I don&rsquo;t know; I didn&rsquo;t have read access on
anything interesting, so I think they&rsquo;re okay, but still it&rsquo;s a tad
scary!</p>

<p>I will disallow any ../ within the dir or file parameters.</p>

<p>Okay, I&rsquo;ve been working on this for a while and have index.pl pretty
much working as I&rsquo;d like it to.  Actually, I still have to let it
display images properly, but that shouldn&rsquo;t be too difficult.</p>

<p>I also would like it to know the date of the files in the directory.
The first two filenames in this dir have a 09 as their first two
characters.  To me it means they were written on the 9th.  I haven&rsquo;t
told index.pl to figure that out yet.  I&rsquo;ll get it.</p>

<p>ANNdd also I&rsquo;d like to have index.pl send me email if it has any
errors.  That will be cool.</p>

<p class=date>31 October 1999</p>

<p><p>After dropping off youth at church, I went home, showered, picked up my friend Nancy and went to Molly&rsquo;s Halloween Simpson&rsquo;s party!</p>

<p><p>Marcel and Kayse were there!  Big hugs to him (and dainty hug to her) Also John, Maggie, Eric, Meredith, Melanie, Steve, Nancy, my Nancy, and Kerry.</p>

<p><p>Apple bobbing contest was great fun!  Boys against girls and we won barely! Steve was pretty slow and I was pretty fast to make up. Marcel was our anchor and we barely won!  Nancy filmed, Nancy watched, Meredith took pictures, and the rest of us got soaked and had great fun!</p>

<p><p>Inside for video games (Sega) and then Silent Football!  I was super excited to play since we didn&rsquo;t play at the rally.  We didn&rsquo;t play too long and probably that was for the best because we had new players, but afterward they were all, &ldquo;I had more fun than expected!&rdquo;  Awesome.</p>

<p><p>Watched Trick-or-Treaters and Simpson&rsquo;s Halloween Specials.</p>

<p><p>Wende called during the evening and I got to talk to her some!</p>

<p><p>Watched X-Files (I was anti-impressed) and then Nancy and I left.  Dropped her off at her house and I went home and wrote this entry.</p>

<p class=date>29-31 october 1999</p>

<p><p>5:31am Saturday 30 October 1999</p>

<p><p>Oh my god it&rsquo;s 5:21 am.  I&rsquo;m at San Antonio Rally.  After work I
was all &ldquo;Ohshit! I didn&rsquo;t get the van!&rdquo;
[it would be a very unfortunate situation to have 12 youth ready to go to San Antonio and me have to say, &ldquo;um, I forgot to pick up the van from the rental place.&rdquo;]
Called the place and they were still open until 6pm.  It was 4:45.  I
went and got it no problem.  All the arrangements had been made by
Rog, and it was beautifully easy for me.</p>

<p><p>Drove back to work to get my CDs because there&rsquo;s a CD player in the rental van!!!!!</p>

<p><p>Then to KTRU to spin Side 1 of &ldquo;The Bear That Wasn&rsquo;t&rdquo; on Jonathan
and Sabrina&rsquo;s show. I got permission from the music director to spin
one side per week!
[there are eight sides on 4 disks in this story-album] Jonathan and
Sabrina gave me phat props on the air afterward. Nice!</p>

<p>((Feb 2015: if I remember correctly, the record was a 45 rpm disk, but
the turntables didn&rsquo;t support that speed, so to make it sound natural,
I spun the record by hand at the right speed.))</p>

<p><p>Home and packed for the rally, shaved my head, shaved my faced,
fixed spelling of Mondro&rsquo;s name on my dj_shadow.html entry and then
drove to church, picked up youth and drove to San Antonio.</p>

<p><p>[We left around 8:25pm and stopped by the bus station in downtown to
pick up Nathan and Ashley. Left the city around 8:50pm. On the way
there, we stopped once for gas (had used a quarter tank) and munchies.
Mostly just listened to music all the way.]</p>

<p><p>Arrived around 12:30am and play play play (re)learning more names:
Zara, Dara, Joanna, Hillary, Patrick, Travis, JoJo, Sam, Karen, Adam,
Oliver.. [if I left someone out that means I forgot you or I for sure know your name!]</p>

<p><p>I just realize for the second time that I don&rsquo;t need a huge
DSL-enabled unix laptop to be able to write these entries! Any laptop
with floppy would be great!</p>

<p><p>Talking to Austin - funny stuff: a pogo stick with a hugenormous
spring that would let us bounce hundreds of feet into the air..</p>

<p><p>Maia came up, &ldquo;hey Rob, where&rsquo;s the other half of your brain?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What????&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Fricke.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Aw man.. Jason had to work. Doh.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p><hr></p>

<p><p>3+ am Sunday 31 Oct 1999</p>

<p><p>YAC meeting was great today.  Joined by Mark Westerburg (sp) who
had super insightful comments and suggestions - great fantastic to
have his input.</p>

<p><p>We got a pretty big lot accomplished - my portion is to help with
website - help Zara update it.</p>

<p><p>Highlights of the day [not at YAC meeting] as I remember them:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Austin and I laffing our asses off practicing our "what's up?" 'skit' thing.  Hardly a skit - a long series of choreographed "gimme five" hand slaps while we kept saying "what's up??" with increasing vigor.  You had to be there.  [We ended up not doing the skit at the talent show because it had no conclusion - nothing really funny about it unless it's spontaneous.]

<p><li>Bryn teaching an American Sign Language workshop.  She taught us stuff like: the letters of the alphabet, man, woman, boy, girl, where, what, why, who, how, my name is ____, how are you?, today, tonight, born, stars, persecute, teach, learn, together, sex, oral sex, lesbian, gay.

<p><li>Talking to Lauren's mom Andrea - and getting big kudos for being ROB that they all love so much.

<p><li>Me and Ashley paired up at worship outside in the freezing cold and having kT come up with her blanket and covered all 3 of us with it.

<p><li>YAC wrote a smoking consequences policy!  Presented it to YRUU and the new bylaws are passed!!!  Yay!! We've been working on this for so long - 3 years I guess.  "No smoking" policy is strong.  It includes 3rd offense = 6 months of no YAC sanctioned events.

<p><li>The funniest thing in the world: 

<p>[pretend you attended Bryn's American Sign Language workshop. Pretend that Ian (tall guy) has walked up with Patrick behind him and Patrick's arms are pointing forward pretending to be Ian's arms. A blanket covers Patrick and Ian's actual arms.]

<p>Austin and I were laughing so hard that our throats were hurting. oh my god this was so funny.  Patrick is signing as Ian translates as if Ian is talking and signing: "lesbian, sex, lesbian, sex, big, lesbian, sex, lesbian, sex" 

<p>[This is just so unfunny compared to the moment.  I told Austin, "this is one of those moments that cannot be captured without a video camera.."]

<p><p>Woke up naturally this morning and just found out we gained one hour of sleep!!  yay!!</p>

<p><p>On the way home kT and I laughed for 20 minutes at an exit sign for Chew Rd.  She took a picture.</p>

<p><p>Drove pretty super fast 80-90mph and got David to his drop off point on the edge of Houston actually 30 minutes early.  We did not stop until we arrived there.  I&rsquo;m thankful for no cops or tickets!</p>

<p><p>Waited until 12:30pm when his parents should have been there and left him at 12:38. I felt a bit nervous to leave him there, but I knew he would be okay. We also had to get Ashley to the bus station at 1pm.</p>

<p><p>Fast again and got her to the station a few minutes early.  She was all, &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;m impressed with your timing.&rdquo;  Me too.</p>

<p><p>Dropped off youth at church and went home to shower before Molly&rsquo;s Halloween party!</p>

<p>DJ Shadow concert was phat.  I&rsquo;m not really into the Hip Hop scene,
(which I realized more after the show,) but I really thought the
turntablism was fresh.</p>

<p>(I have a guess that some of my readers might benefit from some definitions)</p>

<p>(These are my definitions; if you have a better or more precise
definition, use it!)</p>

<p>vinyl n. - twelve inch record with sounds recorded on it. Also &ldquo;wax&rdquo;</p>

<p>turntable n. - device on which vinyl is played.  has a speed adjuster
to change the pitch</p>

<p>volume n. - you know what it is.  Each turntable has one.</p>

<p>spin v. - play vinyl on turntable</p>

<p>DJ n. - individual spinning vinyl</p>

<p>wheels n. - turntables (usually two), used synchronously to allow
continuous music while DJ changes vinyl on one turntable</p>

<p>scratch v. - quickly reversing the direction of spin on vinyl for a
brief instant, or back and forth super quickly.</p>

<p>crossfader n. - analog slide switch that determines which turntable is
being amplified through the system. Left only, both equal, right only,
or any variation is possible.</p>

<p>crossfade v. - using the crossfader to adjust how audible is each turntable.</p>

<p>turntablism n. - the art of using all the above to make mad phat beats!</p>

<p>Some funny things:</p>

<p>Before the show actually started, I sat near the stage watching the
crowd slowly develop. With the lights and music blaring, I likened it
to watching a very loud flower unfold into full bloom.</p>

<p>When the DJs were spinning, I could look back over the crowd (I
retained my position by the stage) and see a sea of bobbing heads,
like a bunch of pigeons.  I was bobbing too, grooving to the
beat&hellip; but what would an extra-terrestrial think?</p>

<p>Some cool things:</p>

<p>Beat juggling.  I had heard the term before, but didn&rsquo;t know what it
meant.</p>

<p>First: two identical records on two turntables, in the same beat.
Crossfade between the turntables is inaudible; they are playing the
same music.</p>

<p>Then: crossfade to one wheel, turn the other back, crossfade to other
wheel, turn the first back, crossfade to one wheel again, turn the
other back&hellip;</p>

<p>Effect: the same beat sequence is repeated (kinda as if the record is
skipping, but without the skip sound).</p>

<p>Note: the DJ has to do this perfectly or it will certainly sound like
crap.  less than half a second to crossfade and spin the record back
to precisely the same spot.. amazing!</p>

<p>The technical skills, the knowledge of exactly what is on the records,
beat juggling, scratching..  were all quite impressive to me.</p>

<p>Mondro (another KTRU DJ) was beside me at the stage and he was all,
&ldquo;yeah that&rsquo;s called beat juggling.  It&rsquo;s how breakbeats and all that
got started.&rdquo;  or something.  Whoah!</p>

<p>In all, the show was not my thing.  Technically yes, but it just
wasn&rsquo;t my music.  Gimme the phat jungle beats anytime.  I&rsquo;m super
thankful for the chance to see it live!</p>

<hr />

<p>I didn&rsquo;t even mention Latyrx (not &ldquo;latrix&rdquo; but &ldquo;la-Teer-ix&rdquo;) two MCs
who were featured. They rapped and got the party waving our hands in
the air, making a lot of noise&hellip; and were certainly having a great
time themselves.  I yelled and waved and had big fun, but in general,
this was also not my thing.  I&rsquo;m still super thankful for the
experience!</p>

<p><p><b>STATE OF MY LIFE</b></p>

<p><p><ol></p>

<p><p><li>I have reviewed 48 CDs for KTRU, many of them this semester!  I like being able to listen and shout in my mind, &ldquo;I reviewed that!!&rdquo;    &ldquo;Review&rdquo; in this context means listen to the CD to see if it&rsquo;s broadcastable by KTRU standards. We rate the songs on a 5 point scale basically and DJs know what&rsquo;s good on the CD before they&rsquo;ve ever heard it or even heard of it. I usually randomly grab CDs I&rsquo;ve never heard and play them when I&rsquo;m there.</li></p>

<p><p><li>A couple nights ago while talking to my dad he was all, &ldquo;if you choose to attend USM, I&rsquo;ll help pay for tuition.  There is a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> tuition scholarship available for first year students, so you could have your first year tuition paid.   &hellip;.  if you drop out, you&rsquo;ll owe me the money back.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Wow.</p>

<p><p>USM is Univeristy of Santa Monica, where he received his masters in Spiritual Psycology with and emphasis in consciousness, health and healing. I have felt myself pulled in that direction-ish.</li></p>

<p><p><li>I was dating someone until&hellip; Monday night I guess.  Now we are broken up.  It didn&rsquo;t happen in one swoop; she was distant over the weekend, I called her on it, and she said &ldquo;I have
been feeling weird about us lately, like I&rsquo;m not getting what I need from our relationship.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I was basically, &ldquo;okay,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you told me.&rdquo;  When I said, &ldquo;maybe we should just be friends,&rdquo; she said &ldquo;okay&rdquo; as soon as I uttered &ldquo;friends.&rdquo;  Fair enough.</p>

<p><p>Oddly, I felt a sort of positive surge of energy, like I had been pushing my energy toward her to try to draw her to me maybe.  When I recognized it was over, my energy came back and I felt better. Hmm. Nice.</li></p>

<p><p><li>In a subsequent conversation with a friend of mine, I described the afforementioned events and five years of my relationship history. The question came back to me, &ldquo;let me get this straight: you&rsquo;ve been in &lsquo;relationship&rsquo; with someone for essentially all of your adult life?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>That hit me pretty well. &ldquo;Um, yes.&rdquo; How pathetic of me.  For how long have I been saying, &ldquo;I need to just <em>not</em> date anyone for a while.&rdquo; ??  How long does the while last?  A month at most.  Okay, maybe 3.  Not a year.  Maybe I should try a one month at a time committment to myself. That feels right.</li></p>

<p><p><li>I have ordered a new domain. Am I too computer nerdy for my own good?  This will be 3 (technically 4) domains that I own. It should be working in a day or so.  I should have it full of data within a couple weeks.  or more.
</li></p>

<p><p><li>On Tuesday night, I went to KTRU to talk with Dennis (DL on the airwaves) who hosts the Hip Hop show every Tuesday night.</p>

<p><p>Oh oh oh oh and!!!  AND!!!!  I got a ticket to DJ Shadow!  The Music Directors or the Promotions Director or somehow the right people knew that I wanted a ticket and I got a message all, &ldquo;Rob, there is an extra Zap Mama CD; it&rsquo;s in my box if you want it&rdquo; from Michael, one of the music directors. (I reviewed and enjoyed our first copy of it.) I was all, Thanks!!! and went to get the CD this morning and BANG there&rsquo;s a DJ Shadow ticket in my CD case!!!  Too too cool.</li></p>

<p><p><li>I finished my plate that I&rsquo;ve been painting at <a href="https://www.themadpotter.com">The Mad Potter</a>! It&rsquo;s a paint-your-own pottery studio on my street. They provide white pottery and paint. Customers provide creativity and a few dollars and get to take home dishwasher safe, totally useable dish!</p>

<p><p>I had been working on this plate since 16 August. I estimate I put about 37 hours into it.  It&rsquo;s pretty detailed, - not an image <em>per se</em> but swirly twisty weaving ribbons of lines and dots.</p>

<p><p>I also did a plate that sports the logo for FSD Data Services on it. I like my job, and wanted my own FSD plate.</li></p>

<p><p><li>Tonight is DJ Shadow concert at Numbers!  1.25 hours until doors open.</li></p>

<p><p><li>Tomorrow (Friday) begins San Antonio Rally, to which I&rsquo;ll be driving a vanload of youth for 35+ hours of talking, play, music, zany antics, and just about any fun (legal) thing one can think of.</li>

<p><p>I came in to work today for the speedy internet connection, and so I could review CDs while I&rsquo;m online.  At home, I use linux to be online, but I haven&rsquo;t set it up to be able to listen to CDs.</p>

<p><p>Today I reviewed <i>pro audio</i> by neil landstrumm, and <i>a ma zone</i> by zap mama.</p>

<p><p>Neil CD was techno-esque with mostly two step (boom tik boom tik boom tik sound) and lots of layers of electronics on that.</p>

<p><p>Zap Mama features beautiful melodious female vocals with a grand variety of instruments backing them up.  The sounds ranged from jazz, to hip hop, to tribal, to funk, to reggae.  Lots of great stuff.</p>

<p><p><hr></p>

<p><p>Last night I went to a party with a friend of mine (I&rsquo;m going to keep this entirely anonymous).  A friend of my friend called the party, with an odd question/concern: had his fiance&rsquo; and a mutual friend showed up at the party?</p>

<p><p>He was at a payphone, slightly intoxicated (he had mostly sobered up after being on the phone with our party for an hour), and had been left there essentially, by his fiance&rsquo; and a friend of his and another friend, because he didn&rsquo;t want to go with them, but wanted to stay home and study.  They refused to take him home, his fiance&rsquo; refused to give him even his house keys&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know the whole story, but he was worried/angry about them, they were no where to be found, and it was just so melodramatic!</p>

<p><p>I don&rsquo;t even really have a point, but it just seemed so odd to me that people would act like that.</p>

<p><p><hr></p>

<p><p>I called Card A today and I have a balance of $5603.22 on it!  Yay!  This is good because it means the balance is being carried at 4.9%, instead of 18 or 13 percent on the other cards.  The 4.9% interest rate is good for 6 months from now, so I will have to move it again in April.</p>
