<p>Cried a lot at closing circle.  Bhyllx came to stand next to me.
So did Bryn.  So did Wende.</p>

<p>Noah, Meg came over after closing circle.  So great to get such
support from them.</p>

<p>On the way back to group camp now.  Great to see YA peeps and to
watch the bridging process of the YRUUers.  I cried for several of
them, mostly Bibby because all three Bibby's were up there Joey, Rick,
Sean to see him across.  I chose not to jump up to hug Bryn even
though I really wanted to.</p>

<p>I got tons of pictures.</p>

<p>But didn't get a picture of me riding around the parking lot on
Austin Roth's handlebars.  It took us two tries to get started and
stable on his bike, but once we did, we pretty much had no problems.
It was a tad scary since I was barefoot.</p>

<p>Good to see Jason.</p>

<p>We just passed C Mart, a precursor to K Mart.</p>

<p class=message>Hey, this is Ben, I'm going to take advantage of this
laptop being conveniently here on my lap to voice my current
feelings. This SWUUSI's felt different for me. It's kind of hard for
me to place my finger on it, but somehow this week hasn't been the
same for me as the past 2 and a half years have. I guess I'm just
getting older. It's a weird sort of paradox because the feeling is so
foreign to me, yet at the same time, it seems right. I'm to the point
in my life when I'm supposed to be feeling this nameless emotion. Next
year still scares me. I'm bridging at SWUUSI '03, at it's scary but I
can tell it's time. I hear so many old schoolers complaining about how
YRUU's changed and blah blah, and yeah, it isn't the same as it used
to be, but I don't think it's worse, it's just different. The reason
why next SWUUSI's going to be my time isn't so much that the
community's changed, but that I've changed. YRUU has been a constant
evolution for me, and I'm reaching the pinacle, I can feel it deep
inside of me. I used to be certain that I'd be in YRUU as long as I
possibly could be, but now I know that I'll be leaving it when I turn
19 at SanAn rally '03. I'll miss all the people here. I've really been
connecting with the younger generation, but I know at the bridging
ceremony next year, there'll probably be more faces on the YA side
that I recognize, than on the YRUU side.</p>

<p>Lunch is late as it's been each day.  Steve explained to Abbey that
when the schedule was designed, the food crew was not consulted; there
is not enough time between breakfast and lunch to prepare lunch for
this many people.</p>

<p>This affects the</p>

<p class=date>12:09pm</p>

<p>Ooooh.  This is interesting.  Bryn, Sean, others addressing the
entire camp around their creation of The Power Table for the third
year in a row.  They are recognizing how it negatively affected the
community.  Sadness.  Noah trying to soften it; Bryn totally torn up
about it.</p>

<p>I love the integrity of YRUU.</p>

<p class=date>12:30pm</p>

<p>This was a community-healing meeting.  Some past sadnesses are
revealed in their greater context; recovery is happening.</p>

<p>Playing Category 51 on the way to main camp for Bridging Ceremony,
categories:
<br>Fast cars (race car 2, race car 3)
<br>paint colors 
<br>footwear
<br>european countries (paris)
<br>Star Wars movies (episode 1, episode 2...)
<br>Band names (Tchaikovsky)
<br>Movies that start with R (Animal House)</p>

<p>Fun stuff!  We didn't follow with rules like "no repeats or
hesitations" even though those are part of the game.</p>

<p>Back from Bridging Ceremony, chilled in touch groups a bit and
discussed the committee on redesigning/moving SWUUSI with input from
David Johnston, the main camp liaison.</p>

<p>huge hollering outside as a mock mob ran from cabin to cabin
hollering "yaahhhhhhh" and "BIG FIGHT!"  "HUGE FIGHT!!
AAAHahahahhhhhhhh!!"!</p>

<p>Gave to Joey my old YAC/YRUU binder.</p>

<p>Talked to Edward Lerner a bit about my CDs that I'm giving
away.</p>

<p>Power Shuffle now.</p>

<p class=date>2:01am</p>

<p>Powerful Power Shuffle.  Abbey read the questions; the rest of us
cried a little or a lot</p>

<p class=date>2:54am</p>

<p>Ben again, talent show time, Amelia's singing Yesterday and doing
fairly well. I had to say as much of my poem as possible from memory,
I kind of stuttered a lot. ^_^;; Rob, Pat, and Bryn did the three
headed monster again and I'd say it was probably the funniest one yet,
I'll miss you guys in the coming year or so.</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>I've just been awakened by Joel, with whom I've hardly spoken in
our YRUU years together.  He's just seemed well connected within the
community; I never approached him, and he never approached me..  until
now.</p>

<p>Such amazing connections can be made in YRUU so amazingly quickly
and with profound depth.  I'm so ..... touched.  Honored.  Thrilled to
have been allowed this opportunity to begin a conversation with
Joel.</p>

<p>Thank you.  Thank you.</p>

<p>Dick is about to pass out.   on the note taker. ow.,
hahahaha uncareful fwaptitude. -mr dicatator.

<br>mr pat: phat pat,
<br>quotefuckyouunquotenowthatourlittlepronounshindigisover: adrienne, 
<br>my dear: asha,
<br>happy shrugs-a-lot: calder</p>

<p>after some massive fwappage. mr dictator forgot asha's name and she
asked whaat the fuck just happened and he told her that he forgot her
name and she asked what happened. .
<br>master masterbation tool master. 
<br>duke dong diced. 
<br>sir schlong spud. 
<br>2 way wormhole between mr pat and mr dictator. 
<br>professor throbbing cock tot. 
<br>doc dick tot.
<br>mr penis dan quayle.</p>

<p>-Mr, Sir, Duke, Herr, Senor, Dr., Czar, meistro, master
<br>-penis, dong, piece of pork, wife's best friend, percy, cock,
willie, john thomas, one eyed trouser snake, stiffy, dick, prick
doodle, george bush, mushroom-headed yogurt slinger,
<br>-potato, tot, fries, kartoffeln, tater, spud, waffle fries, skins,
hash browns, mashed, au graton</p>

<p>happy shrugs-a-lot is now known as Tony Chestnut. (singing) </p>

<p>"i really dont like the motions that that girl makes... then
asha flicks him off. :-P improperly using the zoom. tony chestnut was
deeply offended by it... "fucking scarred for life." </p>

<p>"what is wrong with little bunny foo foo?" "little bunny foo foo
picks up little field mice and bops them on the head.  that's what's
wrong with little bunny foo foo." adrienne had to dance to it while mr
pat shot imaginary guns at her to make her dance "mr dictator, i ran
out of bullets..." mr dictator said something like 'just lower the gun
below the TV like this and when you raise it again it'll be reloaded."
wow. magic. </p>

<p>Calder stole it from Pat, gave it to Rob, stole it from Rob, fwapped
it using the wrong (right) hand on Rob's left leg.
<br>rob also snorted when he laughed. </p>

<p>pat fwapped to himself, fwapped to himself again, and then reveresed
the direction of the fwap to fwap to calder. 
<br>laura said "wheeeee" and got 1/2 a penance point for saying "we". 
<br>Daniel and human chalice got a wormhole. so did adrienne and laura
<br>rob said 2 way black hole hahaha in out in out what kind of black hole
is this? 
<br>human chalice has been drinking too many martini glasses because
martini glasses are chalices - pat. 
<br>"i do not enjoy the sound effects
quote pewn! unquote." -pat as well. </p>

<p>calder didn't notice that she had the ball and pat kept nodding at
laura who eventually was tricked and zoomed the ball. curses. what a
jerk pat is. he lied and said he was misunderstood and received 1.5 a
penance point for false info, lying across wormholes(or something),
and lying to cover butt. </p>

<p>pat went to go take a shower so that he can get his mack
on. inappropriate. (dissapprpriate)
<br>what are you doing" we're playing silent football... no, we're playing
fucking basketball. mr kevin joins the gamme, he doesn't know aboout
wormholes. 
<br>we all said that we like human chalice individually, starting with
laura. daniel said it last and was given .5 a penace point for
succumbing to peer pressure. calder said that the only ones who really
love her are sexy shorts and mr dictator. there is now a debate about
it. apparenly calder would lust for herself too but she doesn't have
to cuz she is herself. wonderful bond etc quote we unquote... bla bla
bla "shut up! jesus christ! this hurts!" - adrienne. human chalice
will now be ignored for 3 minutes. </p>

<p>calder's singing while being ignored. "i have a minute left... 25
seconds.." plus one minute for talking. plus one minute for assaulting
mr. dictator. she's been singing "be kind to our fine feathered
friends on "doo doo do do dood oo" and time. she keeps getting more
for talking and assaulting mr dictator. she wasn't even aware that she
had the ball. actually what she was singing was, as adrienne described
it, "that little tune that is slightly patriotic." </p>

<p>Daniel leaves the game and amber joins. 
human chalice wants to know where her other half is. "'ts right
there." apparently "'ts right" isn't a pronoun. </p>

<p>human chalice has, yet again, recieved a half a penance point for
wasting the universes time and then for repeating herself. she also
requests to leave the universe because she is hallucinating... there
is a dragon above her head. hehe. "theres a dragon right there too."
"I know. don't look at it," says Mr Dictator. she lost. she so
lost. hahaha arguing she had 4.5 and rob said the 4.5 from her last
game turned into a half. then that she got the points from the other
game or something. he;s the dictator, he can do what he wants. pat's

<p>Been flirting more with Abbey, but have relatively kept it clean.
Wonder what will happen..  I wrote her a note that said I look forward
to further conversations.</p>

<p>She and I have been relatively affectionate toward each other.  I
think she's like that with everyone (and I know I am).  We'll see what
happens.</p>

<p>Yesterday during the social action, I hugged her from behind and
she lifted me forward; I bit the middle of her back a bit (pun not
intended).</p>

<p>flirted more with Abbey during dinner today.  Scrubbed our heads on
one another in affectionate puppy ways.  I'm developing a bit of a
crush on her I think.</p>

<p>I look forward to the dance tonight.</p>

<p>I set up a one way wormhole from myself to Erin so that I wouldn't
have to worry about moving the football during the latter part of the
silent football game last night.  That worked well, but I began to
fall asleep as I didn't have to keep track of anything going on.  Or,
not as much.</p>

<p>Slept down by the lake and was presented with a beautiful moonset
near the end of the night.  Ver ver nice.</p>

<p>Just had breakfast of fruit and bagels after spirit circle.  I led
a long version of Aristasha for the group this morning.</p>

<p>Chris and Noah both asked me to go swimming; I said yes to each of them.</p>

<p>Noah and Chris were competing in a run off the dock and jump onto a
raft contest, much to the dismay of Laura and much to my delight.</p>

<p>I, Edward, Phat Pat, Richard all joined them.  Also tried to make a
pyramid.</p>
