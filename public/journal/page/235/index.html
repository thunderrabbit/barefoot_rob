<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what to call them; they&rsquo;re not really drawings, nor are
they paintings..  They&rsquo;ll eventually be pieces of a maze puzzle thing.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll draw a maze or two behind them; I drew some dots on the edges where the maze paths would cross over the different panels, but I made a mistake that will require drawing some more pieces.  Maybe it was intentional so I wouldn&rsquo;t have 4 pieces as a set, because four is unlucky in Japan.</p>

<p>And though I&rsquo;m not particularly happy with it, I made this piece
because Mutsumi&rsquo;s friend asked if I can write some words on a design.</p>

<p>I met Lin in Tokyo so we could meet her friend Daisuke.  He&rsquo;s got a
job interview for which he needs to speak a bit of English.  Lin and I
gave him a few lines which will hopefully help him.</p>

<div class="dream">
With food still onthe table som epeople started to pull the blanket from the bed to cver it, and I kept holding it back saying wait because it would get the balnketst dirty with peach sauce and water some chicken remains; I tried picking up the food; there wasn't much left and finally they stopped and I asked for a towel to wipe up the water and then some orange juice got spiled on the bedge of the bed mattress.  Oh man so now we gotta clean that up.  Fortunatel tere was a plastic liner of holding the liquid so when I got a big towel it sopped up the liquid readily and almost none remained in the bed.  I throught it was very convenient and lucky because if someone peed in the bed, it would be a mess but someone had not so it was okay.  Allthe juice stopped up and I wen t to a dreain the the middle o  the room and  twisted the towerl to squeeze out the liquid. I dripped down into the drean, though not as much came out as I suspected.  I watched teh waer go down the drain and it was all cleaned up.

<p>And through all of that , I didn&rsquo;t pee in the bed.</p>

<p>Tonight was my second night to teach at Kawasaki Daishi.  It&rsquo;s great;
the lessons are casual and it&rsquo;s only a 12 minute TJ Bike ride from our
house.  We practiced using &ldquo;I would like&rdquo; for ordering at restaurants
and reserving airline tickets.</p>

<p>I eventually want to have a cloud server on which I have root access,
but right now, especially for this site, I don&rsquo;t need it.</p>

<p>On Dreamhost, I killed the DNS entry pointing hakyll.robnugen.com to
my EC2 instance, then asked Dreamhost to host hakyll.robnugen.com, but
the DNS doesn&rsquo;t seem to have updated yet.</p>

<pre><code>HI!

I had a custom DNS record pointing hakyll.robnugen.com to an IP on Amazon AWS server. I want to use Dreamhost instead of Amazon for the server, so I killed the custom DNS record, and asked Dreamhost to host hakyll.robnugen.com

On https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.manage
I see a record of hakyll.robnugen.com in my domain listing: &quot;Fully Hosted with PHP 5.4 User: hakyll&quot;

However, after the happy Dreamhost robot created the new user `hakyll` and the domain, I noted there was *NOT* a directory created on Horus at /home/hakyll/hakyll.robnugen.com

I created the directory by hand and populated it with data.

Unfortunately, https://hakyll.robnugen.com/ says there's no site there.

Do I need to tweak something? Do you need to tweak something?

Please let me know, or make the tweaks and enjoy a great day!

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen this truck each time I come to the lessons in Fukuura:</p>

<p><a href="/images/2014/12/Hawaii water 2014-12-10 16.39.32.png"><img src="/images/2014/12/thumbs/Hawaii water 2014-12-10 16.39.32.png" alt="Hawaii Water truck" /></a></p>

<p>##20:26 Wednesday 10 December 2014 JST##</p>

<p>The party was fun; lots of conversation, plus an emcee up front
leading some pre-planned competitive games, then a raffle and
bingo. People mostly stood around tables covered in drinks, candy,
snack foods, tangerines, and some more substantial food,
including 焼きそば plus おでん.</p>

<p>Games included a mini version of sumo wrestling, where the
participants were butt-to-butt on a chair cushion surrounded by mats.
The first person off the cushion lost; it usually took about 0.5
seconds per round! I mentioned to Ashley (the guy for whom I&rsquo;m taking
over classes) that we had a much more balanced game with players
face-to-face, and only allowed to touch with hands.  He said he had
seen a similar game, possibly in Japan.</p>

<p>Another game was a mini drinking competition, but instead of 3 liter
bottles, or gallons of milk, they used 12 (or maybe 16) ounce cola
bottles, and instead of chugging, they sucked it up through silly
straws shaped like glasses (while wearing them).</p>

<p>Ping pong played with non-standard paddles (slippers, pans, bottles,
etc) seemed easy enough, but the winning team only got a volley of 14
hits (whereas one team only got 3!)</p>

<p>For the first 1.5 hours, Ashley and Jessica talked shop (they&rsquo;ve
worked together for a while) and I lurked around them, admiring their
Japanese skizzles. (Man I gotta learn me some Japanese as well.)</p>

<p>Just arrived at 新杉田 so gotta go.</p>

<p>##20:43</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m on the 京浜東北線 now, and there are plennnty of seats!  That&rsquo;s
one really nice thing about this particular class; I can pretty much
sit down all the way both ways.</p>

<p>Hopefully I can snag this class on a permanent basis.  Just gotta tell
JB that I can do it.</p>

                        <p>##16:00 Wednesday 10 December 2014 JST##</p>

<ol>
<li><p>TLDR: I&rsquo;ve been a lazy bum recently.  And I love it.</p></li>

<li><p>Maybe the coolest thing recently: Mutsumi introduced me to
Funatsu-san, who liked my art and asked if she can put some in a
show in January!</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve been teaching a few lessons per week with a language school,
but other than that, doing a lot of Minecraft, and drawing a few
mazes.  With the news above, I&rsquo;m more excited to make some art!</p></li>

<li><p>Lin and I live in Kawasaki with our two cats, Ted and Jennie, who
are currently not allowed to go outside nor sleep with us at night.
I&rsquo;d love to let them outside, but Lin agreed with the shelter that
she will keep them inside.  We had let them sleep with us, but one
of them urinated on Lin&rsquo;s comforter so they&rsquo;ve lost their bedroom
priveleges.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;m arriving now at a train station where I need to change; I might
forget about this entry.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve just moved from AWS to DH.  Due to a blip in Dreamhost&rsquo;s DNS
something something, I had to write to them to get the site
activated; I think it&rsquo;s working now, and I Stopped the EC2
instance.</p></li>

<li><p>Because I&rsquo;m using markdown to mark up my journal, I don&rsquo;t have to
use the actual number when creating numbered lists.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;m sitting in the driver&rsquo;s seat of a driverless train on the
Seaside Line, heading to 福浦.  (I guess that kanji is correct.)
This is what driverless cars might feel like, except my insulated
environment (in the train) is inside an insulated environment
(elevated roadway with limited public access)</p></li>

<li><p>Hmm.  I don&rsquo;t see a way to make multiple paragraphs within one
numbered section.</p></li>

<li><p>From this train, I can see a large wind turbine, which I htink is
the same one I could see from our previous apartment (in 朝日町ハイツ)</p></li>

<li><p>Oh shit I see the line splits; I hope to goodness that I&rsquo;m on the
right track!!!  Ah, I guess that&rsquo;s not for public use; the line
drawn on the map is just a straight line with no branches.</p></li>

<li><p>This is more like a stream of consiousness thing instead of a State
of My Life.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;m still using my iPHone 4S which I&rsquo;ve had for a while. The
battery has been draining a bit faster than I&rsquo;d like.  I thought I
had all the energy-drainers turned off, but maybe not.  Maybe the
battery is just getting tired.  My phone number is the same one
I&rsquo;ve had for years in Japan.</p></li>

<li><p>Main work projects: unpaid iOS work with Tariq (though we are
hoping for some sales with our latest set up updates)</p></li>

<li><p>Every time I use my computer for longish periods of time, my hands
get cold.  Especially my mouse hand.  I imagine taht&rsquo;s a good
reason to <em>not</em> do computer stuff for longish periods of time.  Is
it my body&rsquo;s way of telling me to stop it altogether? Or shall I
just set up a more ergonomic setup?</p></li>

<li><p>I need to convert AB&rsquo;s EC2 instance to two instances: one for DB
and one for the website.  I&rsquo;m guessing the DB can be behind a
firewall; I don&rsquo;t know the optimal way to set it up, much less the
optimal way to transition to that new configuration.  I&rsquo;ll
basically just rtfm, and maybe some toots, and hopefully it will be
all good.  AND I&rsquo;ll document the proverbial shit out of everything
I do.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve got emacs set up to create journal entries, though I don&rsquo;t
have the final touches set up.  I mean I can type <code>C-x j</code> to start
a new entry, and it will even ask for the title, tags, and let me
overwrite the date if needed.  However, if I do overwrite the date,
I&rsquo;d like it to put the date I enter and add a note saying the
actual date the entry was written.  I don&rsquo;t yet have a keystroke
way to insert a new date in the middle of the text, but that&rsquo;s not
as high priority as having entries named &ldquo;dream&rdquo; automagically get
class=&lsquo;dream&rsquo; divs wrapped around the text.  I had that kinda stuff
set up before, but I don&rsquo;t know where the code may be hiding.  It
could even be lurking around on my current local drive, but I&rsquo;m not
sure.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven&rsquo;t written any automated stuff to have Sublime do journal
entries, partially because I haven&rsquo;t registered (paid for) Sublime
yet (and therefore don&rsquo;t use it much).</p></li>

<li><p>Lin and I went to the Tokyo ET Contact group in November, and plan
to go again in December.  I&rsquo;m hoping to attend most of the
meetings; I want to foster relations between our civilizations.  I
want a degree in intergalactic diplomacy (or at least intergalactic
relations)!</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;m scheduled to go to CPC clinic in February; not sure if I&rsquo;ll do
it though.</p></li>

<li><p>Lin and I are planning to take a <del>reasonably</del>
<ins>vaguely</ins> long bicycle ride during the new year holidays.
No specific plans yet.</p></li>

<li><p>I need to go to 二子玉川 to get (one of) her Christmas
present(s). (I promised her a Harrod&rsquo;s bear each year that we don&rsquo;t
have kids.)</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve been using some of my free time to meditate more and maintain
awareness of consciousness.  I haven&rsquo;t noticed any &ldquo;amazing&rdquo;
experiences, not that conciousness itself isn&rsquo;t amazing.</p></li>

<li><p>Been working with Soness a bit to help get her paperwork sorted.
It&rsquo;s fun to chat with her more often than we had been for the past
couple years.</p></li>

<li><p>I ain&rsquo;t really talked with Dad in a while, nor with Ma.  Nor with
Fred, for that matter; he and I used to talk just about every day
for a couple months there.  I sent him a present and it&rsquo;s been
chillin&rsquo; at the post office in Austin (I can tell from the
tracking website); he must be busy!  I sent him a reminder and he
was like, &ldquo;oh yeah!!&rdquo;</p></li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p>From my perspective, at a larger scale:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We still live primarily in a fiat currency based system.  Some
crypto currencies have been developed on &ldquo;the blockchain&rdquo;
(Bitcoin, Litecoin, probably others), and some other similar
currencies have been developed, my favorite being Dogecoin.</p></li>

<li><p>We still primarily burn fossil fuels for energy.  There are
whistleblowers online saying free energy is possible, but hidden
from public access.</p></li>

<li><p>We still primarily use &ldquo;conventional&rdquo; methods of
transportation. There&rsquo;s not even a specific word that I know of to
describe transportation not via teleportation.</p></li>

<li><p>Extraterrestrial life has not been publicly acknowledged by (most?)
governments.</p></li>

<li><p>Earthquakes are officially not predictable.  Weather is not
particularly changeable (that I know of, except by cloud seeding
to make it rain)</p></li>

<p>It cost me about $13 last month I think.  Apparently the &ldquo;free&rdquo;
instance only applies to new accounts.</p>
