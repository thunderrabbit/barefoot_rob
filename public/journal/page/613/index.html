<p><p>I&rsquo;ve essentially started over my generic survey
project.  My goal this time is to make it <em>so</em> generic
that we can just drop information into about 20
variables and a few datasets and <em>bang</em>.  New
survey.</p>

<p><p>So far I&rsquo;ve gotten the first page <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of the way
finished.  Great job, Rob!</p>

<p><p>Tonight hopefully Wende and I are going to watch a
movie.  We might also see <em>Chicken Run</em>
tomorrow morning!  Yay!</p>

<p><p class="dream">I was at an outdoor table at a cafe with Susan from my old work,
eating lunch.  We used to eat lunch watching out her window while
talking.</p>

<p><p class="dream">She told me about her life update and then I described me an&rsquo;
Wende&rsquo;s house in the manner I&rsquo;ve done so many times, except this time,
I used salt and pepper shakers as a model for the different stories of
the house.</p>

<p><p class="dream">It&rsquo;s a 3 story townhouse,&rdquo; I said, stacking salt then pepper shaker
on top of that. (both on top of a cube of paper designed to be a
telephone notepad.)  &ldquo;On the first floor is the garage and guest
bedroom.  On the second floor is the living room and dining room.
On the third floor is master bedroom, master bathroom, and study,&rdquo; I
indicated at the paper, and salt and pepper shakers reespectively.
&ldquo;And the stairs are in the middle of the house.  Not like against one
wall, but bang right in the middle, separating the living room and
dining room.  We love it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Then I was awakened by one of the cats throwing up.  Doh.</p>

<p><p>I finished the initial DTRU project today.  It&rsquo;s
mostly a small subset of the big big project that I&rsquo;d
been working on for months, but with some changes that
took a couple of days each.</p>

<p><p>Now I can get back to working on the fake
inheritance that I had been doing at the beginning of
this week.  Wheee!</p>

<p><p>Super awesome!! &ldquo;The details have not been
announced yet,&rdquo; but KTRU is broadcasting at 91.7fm in
the real world, <em>and</em> broadcasting at 91.5fm on
campus!!  This is to fix problems with reception on
campus, !!and!! (this is the good part for me) I can
now listen to KTRU at work!!!  Used to be that the
signal didn&rsquo;t make it into our building well.  But now
it does!  Yay 91.5fm!!</p>

<p><p>After Wende got home, I took a short nap then went to play
ultimate.</p>

<p><p>To be more precise, I had to greatly talk myself into going.  I
felt SO tired and SO wanted to keep on sleeping.  But I got myself up
and drove out there.  By the time I reached the field, I was pretty
much awake and happy to be there.</p>

<p><p>By the time I jogged around the field, I was definitely awake and
loosened up and ready to play!</p>

<p><p>I played well, not Super Incredible Wonderboy style, but pretty
good.  Caught a few points, had a few good throws.</p>

<p><p>The funniest throw I made was a forehand, perfectly straight and
level and pretty much the entire length of the field.  The funny thing
about it, the guy to whom I was throwing the disc ran an S pattern
around the trajectory of the disc!</p>

<pre>
      /
     /.
    /
       ( .
    \
    .\
      \
       .   )
      /
      .  /
    /
     .

    .

   .

  .

 .
</pre>

<p><p>He ran the lined pattern, while the disc took the dotted line path.
He caught the disc.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m so so so super glad I went!!!!</p>

<p class=date>11:48pm CDT Wednesday 28 June 2000</p></p>

<p><p>After work I did great on my (borrowed) unicycle!  This time I rode
4 blocks each direction to the gas station to put air in the tire.  I
only had to dismount one time in the middle of each trip!  (once on
the way there, once on the way back)</p>

<p><p>Then around the block again, falling once during that trek.</p>

<p><p>For some reason, I feel like I&rsquo;m riding crookedly, or sitting kinda
at an angle on the seat.  Partially I think I can correct this when I
get on by holding the seat, but partially I think it might be
something else.</p>

<p><p>But I believe with practice, I&rsquo;ll keep getting better!</p>

<p><p>I also think I might want to get a different seat; this one is
padded, but not super comfortable.  We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

<p><p>The <em>Cirque du Soleil: Journey of Man</em> was truly impressive.
Astonishing feats of strength, flexibility, balance, precision, were
awe-inspiring.  I was moved to tears at their sheer perfection.</p>

<p><p>GO SEE the movie!!  It&rsquo;s 8 bucks at Edward&rsquo;s IMAX thingy on the
corner of I-10 and 610 in Houston, and it&rsquo;s playing in a couple more
<a href="https://www.edwardscinemas.com/imax/nowshowing/">cities</a>.
Oh, and it&rsquo;s 3-D.  The goggles are a bit klunky, but made me feel like
the action was <em>right</em> there.</p>

<p><p>Plus there was an underlying story that all should hear.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ll make this short.</p>

<p><p>Before the movie, Wende and I met at Boston Market for dinner.  I
drove my car from home; she drove her truck from work. We left Scott
at Boston Market and took her truck to the movie.</p>

<p><p>After the movie we went home to P, then <em>doh</em>!  We forgot my car.
Back out to get Scott, but decided to get ice cream at Kroger first.</p>

<p><p>Doh!  I left my shoes at home.  So Wende went inside to get ice
cream and I walked toward Scott to just go home.</p>

<p><p>Sneakily, I ran to Scott, to get my sandals, with plans to run back
and surprise Wende in Kroger.</p>

<p><p>Doh!  My sandals were in her truck cause we took them on vacation
this past weekend.</p>

<p><p>Found some socks in my trunk.</p>

<p><p>Running running back toward Kroger, across the street and</p>

<p><p>Doh!  A truck turned left toward the crosswalk across which I was
running.  I veered out of the way, s/he stopped and HOOOONNNNKKed the
horn and I kept running but yelled, &ldquo;I HAVE THE RIGHT OF WAY!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Inside Kroger found Wende and we got some food and ice cream and
came home.</p>

<p><p>Work today has been pretty interesting.  I&rsquo;ve been coding the pseudo inheritance stuff that I started on Thursday or so.  Pretty good stuff, but I&rsquo;m not yet at a point where I can see for sure that it will save development time.</p>

<p><p>A storm just blew by, and we did not lose power.  I almost wanted to lose power so I can argue for purchasing a UPS for each machine.</p>

<p><p>I started at work at around 8 today (usually I&rsquo;m here by 10).  The great thing is, I pretty much can leave right now!</p>

                        <p class=date>10:42am Saturday 24 June 2000</p>

<p>Right after waking up, I swam across the river, which was pretty freezing at first.. I'm guessing 60 feet across and clamboured up on the rocks.  I walked along the bottom of the cliff which I was unable to climb.  No snakes or spiders, but met one wasp/bee thing who buzzed menacingly near me, but didn't attack me.

<p>While standing on top of a tall rock, ignoring visions of the rock tumbling out from underneath me, I looked for wende across the river.  I didn't see her, so started walking back down.  Soon as I got to shore, she got to the other shore.

<p>Swam across and had breakfast met the peeps and their kids and stuff. 

<p>After breakfast, Wende and I took a nap (otherwise she didn't feel like it was a vacation) and she pointed out we had never taken a vacation together.

<p>Now packing our stuff to go drive around lookin' for places to get married after we jump on the trampoline some.

<p class=date>12:11pm</p>

<p>I did 11 front flips.

<p>At checkout, we talked to Al and Sandra randomly.  He told me about his kids and Wende paid the bill.  $145 including tax for the night.  We asked them about locations of different lodges that may host a wedding.  One place charges $10,000 just for the site, not counting anything extra.

<p>We just reserved all the cabins of a lodge on the river!  This is where Wende's family reunion was held a couple of years ago.

<p>Now that our mission is accomplished, we can go play!!

<p class=date>1:30 pm</p>

<p>lunch and wedding list

<p class=date>2:32pm </p>

<p>Ate at Hunt store which sells groceries and is a restsurant.

<p>Chillin' under <a href="http://www.alfredshepperd.com/Stonehenge/untitled.html">Stonehenge II</a>, while Wende gets my shoes these stickers hurt!

<p class=date>4:46pm - miles 313.2 traveled.</p>
<p class=note>(written by Wende)</p>

<p>We canoed at River Bend Inn.  Rob ogled Christie (sp).</p>

<p class=date>7:53pm - mile 682</p>

<p class=note>(written by Wende)</p>

<p>Rob just cleaned the windshield, intentionally trying to spray the car behind us.  At first, it seemed that it wasn't working but just when we were ready to give up, they switched lanes and turned their wiper blades on.  "It's working, it's working!" Rob cried.  Victory.</p>

<p class=date>9:33pm - 251 miles traveled</p>

<p class=note>(written by Wende)</p>

<p>We stopped for dinner at Sonic in Colombus - talked about all the small-town-hanging-out that Rob didn't do in Tomball.  We just passed a small truck very much on fire.  Called 911 but they already knew about it.</p>

<p><p>Home safely around 10:30pm</p>
