<p class=note>(most extensive dream ever)</p>

<p>&lt;! p class=dream I took a risk and told Sally how much I love her,
while we&gt; <p class=dream>Sally and I
were hanging out at some small city that I&rsquo;ve never previously been.
We were in her old neighbohood, inside a cafe type thing, with lots of
other students, all friends.  Sally was eating some toast from
another&rsquo;s plate and after a while I reached over to get some eggs off
this plate that had apparently been abandoned, and she was all, &ldquo;oh!
no, those are his; he still wants the eggs, just not the toast.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p>&lt;!p class=dream She told me that she likes affection and kisses and
cuddling, and sitting on lap hugging, and that I can show her
affection that way.&gt;</p>

<p class=dream>We were in an old garage looking for something, as
there was some common enemy, looming in the near future, the possible
end of the world via aliens or something.</p>

<p class=dream>In this garage were lots of small parts and tools like
an auto garage, with rags and grease and half started and half
finished projects all over the place.</p>

<p class=dream>We came across an object that looked like a long sharp
tusk with some buldges down in its length.  This turned out to be a
mysterious otherworldly object,, a portal to a whole 'nother univere
at its very tip.  For if one were to look down at the very tip of this
tusk, there would appear an intricate city of infinite expanse all
within this tiny point. Any different angle one viewed the tusk tip
would bring into view a different portion of this universe, each of
which seemed to never end.  As if all the points of view from that
other universe were focused onto this tiny point.</p>

<p class=dream>Scientists on our side did not undersand this
phenomenon, and generally feared it, and feared for the safety of
humans who studied it too carefully, thinking they might be
assimilated or fall into this other universe somehow.</p>

<p class=dream>Though this universe in a point was outside in a dense
jungle, and surrounded as if guarded by an intense cloud of
mosquitoes, thousands of human visitors flocked to it, just to get a
glimpse of this magical phenomenon.</p>

<p class=dream>Fred pulled out some super mosquito spray, and I was
all, "why would you think necessarily that their mosquitoes would be
affected by our mosquito spray?"</p>

<p class=dream>"I can't know for sure, bit it's possibly better than
nothing."</p>

<p class=dream>As our group walked across the mall parking lot toward
this forest with the mystery point, Fred doused himself in mosquito
spray, and hardly noticed that others might need it as well.  As we
crossed paths with a japanese girl she said, "you'll need more than
that."</p>

<p class=dream>"More than that what?" I asked, wondering if she was
talkng about the mosquitoes.</p>

<p class=dream>"The mosquitoes back there are amazing.  You will each
need that much spray, and even that might not be enough."</p>

<p class=dream>Wow.</p>

<p>I woke up.</p>

<p>I just bought a 99 cent thing of travel shampoo (after leaving my
first shampoo in Austin, and my second one in Kalamazoo) for 100
cents.  When the girl said, "one dollar,"  I was all, "what's your tax
rate around here?"</p>

<p>"7.5 percent."  She examined the receipt.  "But you only got
charged 1 percent tax for this."</p>

<p>"Do you have any idea why?"</p>

<p>"Nope," she smiled, "no idea."</p>

<p>I'm not complaining.  "Okay, have a great day!"</p>

<p>I've been working on Kim's website for some hours today.  I'm
getting a bit hungry.  Also need to mail Bryn's letter.</p>

<p>Now the site correctly Creates new files and Modifies existing
files.  Still need to create/update the file viewer once they exist.
This setup should work for all three different file types: poetry,
meditations, sci-fi snippets.  But I haven't test that capability
yet.</p>

<p>Also still need to allow the creat</p>

<p>I've been listening to music quietly through my little speakers
cause I can't find my headphones.  Last place that I know I had them
was Memphis.</p>

<p>I've just arrived at M & M's mom's house, just as Eminem's "Lose
Yourself" came on the radio, so I listened to that first.  Excellent.</p>

<p>I've been here like two minutes and she's cooking me pork chops and
potatoes.</p>

<p class=date>10:28pm</p>

<p>Kathy came over for a while (mom's oldest daughter) and chatted
some.  I started to get really sleepy and went downstairs to sleep,
but now I've been doing email for over an hour.  Got 8 messages
written.  Awesome.</p>

<p>I found out where there's a local 24 hour Kinko's.  I'll go there
when I wake up in 7 hours or so.</p>

<p>Today I'm still in Chicago, still at M's house, hosted by Steve.  I
stayed another night because he was so helpful with my perl problem.
I'm quite thankful for that.</p>

<p>I need to leave by 1pm to be gone before it gets all crazy here
with M and her three kids coming home.  (They know I'm here, but Steve
asked that I geo before they arrive.</p>

<p>My dreams featured Jennifer from Paint This!, in a big new store,
and a customer that was trying to hit on me or something.</p>

<p>Fred showed up in a later dream; he was also on a road trip, and
jokingly asked me if I wanna race.  I was all "sure," and held my
hands side by side like two cars and then made them drive off
quickly... in opposite directions.</p>

<p>I'm so funny, even in my sleep.</p>

<p>I'm leaving now to visit Maggie and Molly's Mom in Bloomington.</p>

<p>Got a lot done on Kim's website.  I'm quite thankful for that!</p>

<p class=date>2:47pm</p>

<p>Am I a sucker?  Maybe.  Got hit from behind by a cab, and it bent
my bike wheel a bit and the disc brake a lot.  I can fix the wheel,
will likely have to get a new brake.  I asked for $50 and he gave me
$40, saying he didn't have more, and some shit about needing to buy
food and whatever.</p>

<p>I took a mental moment and then blessed his path.  $40 and he got
off easy with no ticket, etc.</p>

<p>2600 miles traveled.  It was in bumper to bumper traffic toward
dwntown Chicago so the hit wasn't very hard.<p></p>
</p>

<p>I'm smiling.  I've got a tough fucking bike.</p>

<p class=date>3:38pm</p>

<p>2625 miles traveled.  I just got gas for $1.579 per gallon.  I'm
feeling pretty good on my trek now.  Far better than last night.</p>

<p>Scott is at 145999 miles now.</p>

<p class=date>4:05pm</p>

<p>I'm thankful to not be in the wreck apparently up ahead of me on 55
near 80.  I'm at 646.4 miles on trip meter now.   Two ambulances and
two police type cars have gone past us.</p>

<p>Big fire engine just went by.</p>

<p class=date>4:09pm</p>

<p>Another big fire engine just went by.  I'm at 646.6 miles.</p>

<p class=date>4:10pm</p>

<p>One lane getting by.  One car in ditch, pretty fucked up, but still
upright.  646.9 miles and back underway.</p>

<p class=date>5:01pm</p>

<p>I can inconsistently almost rap all of "my dad's gone crazy" by
Eminem.</p>

<p>2698.3 miles traveled since Dallas.</p>

<p class=date>5:18pm</p>

<p>I don't know my mileage, but I know I'm at a rest area where I just
paid $0.75 to get 2 packages of Reeses Peanutbutter Cups because the
last person's cups didn't fall from the vending machine.  I tried
banging on it a bit, but they didn't fall, so I figured it was worth
$0.75 to get two.</p>

<p>I've just bounced/jumped/swung/etc (dangerously considering I was
carrying my laptop with one hand) across the playground here, with
chipped tires that make a relatively bouncy landing surface for the
ground.</p>

<p>Okay, I'm going to walk over a bridge behind this area and see if
it's interesting back there.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>It looks pretty, with a trail winding through sparse trees, but
it's a bit nippy outside and I'm still in t-shirt and shorts from
today (and yesterday; no shower), so I'm going to roll on.</p>

<p class=date>6:01pm</p>

<p>Oh my god.  If I could take a picture of <em>one</em> (1) one thing
so far, it would be this streetsign:  RAAB.</p>

<p>Special thanks to kT for giving me that name.</p>

<p>I'm on 51 business now, rolling into Bloomington.  Maybe I can get
a pic since I know people who live near here.</p>

<p>After some brainstorming with Steve, I'm sketching out some ideas
for Kim's website, so I can finish my web-design-debt to him and quit
worrying about it longer.</p>

<p>Thing is, I've got in my head a grand idea of making it really
really really awesomely easy for him to update, and I just don't know
if I'm smart enough to make it all happen.</p>

<p>Of course I am, but dammmm; this is a good challenge.</p>

<p class=date>5:21pm</p>

<p>no, this is a sucky challenge.</p>

<p>I emailed Kim to see if I could get him to call me here and go over
specifications with me.  My I-group will be meeting in about 1 hour,
oh wait they are meeting right now since my computer is still on EDT.
Lemme fix that.</p>

<p class=date>4:27pm</p>

<p>Oh.  I'm silly.  It's an hour earlier now, not later.</p>
