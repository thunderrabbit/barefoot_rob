<p>It's flat *snowing* here in Dallas!  Big huge flakes that I was
actually able to see from bed with my glasses off, and I though "meh,
big rain drops dripping..." but it's <em>snow!</em></p>

<p>It's not reeeally accumulating, but there's about a 1/4 inch on the
grass.  None on the streets or sidewalks; it just melts.  But there's
plenty on Scott.  I'm glad I don't have to drive him today.</p>

<p>I think I'll go ride my bike out in it.  Just to go see the lake
and stuff.</p>

<p>Am I crazy????  Brrrrrr!!!!</p>

<p class=date>2:49pm</p>

<p>I got well-bundled with long johns (couldn't find my long top),
jeans, socks, shoes, long sleeve sweat shirt, hoodie, bicycle gloves,
leather gloves, then headed out.</p>

<p>Snow stingingly in my face if I looked up to see where I was going,
so I rode looking down most of the way, looking forward just enough to
verify safe travels to the lake.</p>

<p>I expected to see almost no one, but found some people on razor
scooters on the way there, and some little kids with parents at the
playground by the lake.  Most things were covered in snow, like a
layer an inch thick.</p>

<p>Kept inadvertantly stalking a woman who was running with her dog.
I'd keep passing her, going someplace random and then back to the
trail just before or after she had gone by.  I hope she didn't feel
stalked.</p>

<p>I rode back behind the waterworks building, and chose not to ride
with Sean's bike on top of the 3 foot wall overlooking the lake.  I
almost rode down the steep hill facing the other direction, but chose
not to.  But I'm closer to doing it than when I first saw this slope.
Saw the dog woman again.</p>

<p>Rode back into the island area that is pretty easily accessible now
that the water is way way lower than it was that night.  It's almost
back to normal levels.  Or maybe this is normal, and it's been lower
than normal before.  Whatever.  About a 1/2 inch is flowing over the
entire spillway.  Saw the dog woman again.</p>

<p>Rode over the walking bridge, out onto a dock thing and made a
design with my wheels in the snow.  Saw the dog woman again.</p>

<p>Headed back home, leaving the dog woman behind.  I'd started to
worry that Sean might want his bike to ride around in the snow.</p>

<p>Just exactly as I rode up to the house, Sean pulled up to the
house.  <em>Perfect</em> timing.  I expressed thanks for his bike and
he was all, "no problem; just throw it in the back of the truck; I'm
coming to pick up my stuff."</p>

<p>Chatted with him a bit as he loaded up a box of stuff to take back
to college today.  He was all, "bye room," as he left his room.</p>

<p>Big hugs and he headed out.</p>

<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<p><ul>
<li><b>~</b> I&rsquo;ve been living at Bibby&rsquo;s house in Dallas for the past some
months.</li>
<li><b>!</b> I&rsquo;ve driven on my eastern state trek, as far east as western West
Virginia, and as far north as southern Michigan.</li>
<li><b>@</b> I&rsquo;ve driven on my western state trek, as far west as western
California (Santa Monica, LA, Newport Beach) and as far north as
Eugene Oregon to see Dude and Veronica.</li>
<li><b>#</b> I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to attend San Antonio Rally since I&rsquo;m not an
official advisor at a church.  This reason seems fishy, and I feel
like I&rsquo;ve been individually targetted, but I&rsquo;m pretty much over it.
Shit that was back in October so I oughta be over it.</li>
<li><b>$</b> My final planned Rally is Houston, which will be over in less than
one week!!!!  Holy shit that is amazing, exciting, scary, tragic.
YRUUers are still in my dreams every night; I&rsquo;m going to miss advising
a lot.</li>
<li><b>%</b> I&rsquo;ve been &ldquo;invited&rdquo; to the last half of Houston Rally.  I&rsquo;m
thankful for this; I&rsquo;m glad I was able to negotiate my way into
attending the best part of the rally (Saturday night to closing
circle) which will certainly include hella Silent Football!</li>
<li><b>^</b> But the wizack thing is that it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s a big deal being
made about when I get to attend the rally.  The rally is for the
youth, and to only allow me to attend <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> of it kinda puts a limelight
on me that shouldn&rsquo;t be there.  Just let me attend the whole operation
and allow the youth to just be themselves and do whatever they do.</li>
<li><b>&amp;</b> I&rsquo;ve officially been offered a job to teach in Japan!  I called
Brian at the San Francisco office a couple days ago and he confirmed
it.  They had sent an acceptance thing to my old address on 9
December.  It apparently was not forwarded to my dad; ohhhhh.. is it
only a 90 day forwarding thing?   180 days?  It&rsquo;s close to that now.
Anyway, whatever.  They are sending it to me here in Dallas and I
should get it this coming week and I plan to send it back before
Houston Rally.</li>
<li><b><em></b> Because of the delay, I won&rsquo;t be able to go in February; March is
the earliest I can make.</li>
<li><b>(</b> Janette and i are tossing around ideas of traveling in February;
maybe a quick jaunt to Hawaii!!!!! but I&rsquo;m not 100% sure on finances.
A big part of me is like fuckit and just go and pay it all back when I
start bling blingin&rsquo; again from Japan.</li>
<li><b>)</b> I also wanna go see family in West Virgina again, specifically to
see Sarah (I&rsquo;ve felt bad for never coming back to play with Shane
between when I saw him at like 9 years old and then <em>bam</em> he&rsquo;s
suddenly 17 or some shit.)  Sarah is little, and she&rsquo;s still little,
and I&rsquo;d love to go for walks with her again.  Plus get to see Barbie
and her cute friend Elizabeth and go for longer walks with her.</li>
<li><b>-</b> Maggie has been planning my 12000th day party.  I&rsquo;ve sent emails
to some people to tell them to clear their calendar, but we don&rsquo;t know
where the party will be yet.  Looks like Jillian&rsquo;s will be it.</li>
<li><b>~=</b> I&rsquo;m basically inviting all my friends and all YRUUers who have
graduated.  If you wanna be on the invite list, email me <a
href="mailto:12000@robnugen.com">12000@robnugen.com</a></li>
<li><b>~!</b> I&rsquo;ve almost finished typing up the rules to Silent Football.</li>
<li><b>~@</b> I looked into ways of using CSS to create an ol.jackie class,
but this will have to do.</li>
<li><b>~#</b> I haven&rsquo;t worked for money since before my western state
trek.  I&rsquo;ve talked with Johnny to see if he has work for me.  He said
he may have some at his house, which I assume is not his farm way out
near Crawford, though that might be cool in a way to see what kind of
hick town the President came from.</li>
<li><b>~$</b> I don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;ll be in Japan; I don&rsquo;t know what
my life will be like in two months.  How wiggidy wack to think how
different it may be than right now, where everything is comfortable.
Where I know the language, where the street addresses are in numerical
instead of chronilogical order, where my old friends are close.  What
marvelous marvels will I encounter?  Will I be placed in Tokyo?  Will
I be able to easily connect my computer to hi-bandwidth internet, free
of charge?  Will I have an international cell phone?  (I do know I
plan to have a cell phone only and not a landline, even if a landline
is the only way to have internet access close by)  (I also know that
Japanese cell phones are miles ahead of ours in coolness and
technology, at least according to lots of stuff I&rsquo;ve read)</li>
<li><b>~%</b> I still have Scott and plan to give him to Janette as a
thank you for letting me sponge in her house for so long.</li>
<li><b>~^</b> I need to get Scott&rsquo;s oil changed.</li>
<li><b>~&amp;</b> I haven&rsquo;t heard from Kim Sawyer in a while, not since I
finished his website, except for an email he sent out to a bunch of
cats inviting them to attend one of his coaching classes.  I can see
therefore he&rsquo;s been busy, which explains why he hasn&rsquo;t really checked
out the site updater.</li>
<li><b>~</em></b> I need to start thinking about what I&rsquo;m going to take to
Japan.  I wanna take my bike, but I might have it sent over after I&rsquo;m
settled.  I apparently need to have some suits (!) to wear.  I&rsquo;ve got
two pair of fly shoes, and two suits (though I can only think of where
one of my suits is).  Not really enough white shirts, and I think I
have a cache of ties somewhere.  Maybe my suits are at Ma&rsquo;s in
Austin.  That would make sense.  I think I gave them to Fred to take
to her house just before SWUUSI</li>
<li><b>~(</b> I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;ll be able (allowed) to go to SWUUSI
next year.  I&rsquo;ll request the time off and apply; but overall I release
this to my higher power.</li>
<li><b>~)</b> I&rsquo;ve been keeping up with YRUUers Live Journals for some
time now.  Also with world news via Google.  I wonder how that might
change when I&rsquo;m overseas.</li>
<li><b>~-</b> I wonder who (from my current life) will visit me while
I&rsquo;m in Japan.  (This makes me wonder if I&rsquo;m going to Japan to see some
of my peeps from past lives; it makes sense that I am, but by &ldquo;current
life&rdquo; above I meant the people that I&rsquo;ve hung out with in the past
five years.)</li>
<li><b>!=</b> I wonder if I will or will not write a lot of letters out of
lonliness or excitement at so much great stuff.</li>
<li><b>!~</b> I can rap the lyrics to Eminem&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rabbit Run&rdquo; with or
without the music playing.  Without the music I can rap through it
almost perfectly faster than he does on the album.</li>
<li><b>!!</b> I wonder if I&rsquo;ll be able to watch current movies in
English overseas.</li>
<li><b>!@</b> I wonder how many women I&rsquo;ll get crushes on.  I&rsquo;m not
attracted to Japanese women <em>per se</em>, but I may just possibly
find some other cool world travelers there.</li>
<li><b>!#</b> I wonder how easily I&rsquo;ll be able to learn Japanese:
reading, writing, speaking, listening.</li>
<li><b>!$</b> I have a goal of becoming fluent in three more languages
(starting with Japanese) within 10 years.</li>
<li><b>!%</b> I look forward to coming back to US culture and having
the experience of not being able to remember the English word for
something.  Not an unrecoverable memory failure, but just that a
different language is on top of my brain for once.</li>
<li><b>!^</b> </li>

<br> saw a reference to this in re-reading some of our old corresspondence.<br>
i love how big chunks of time and  experiences that will influence the rest of your lfe can be condensed into one or two items;  &ldquo;.! i&rsquo;ve driven on my eastern state trek&hellip;&rdquo; and &ldquo;.@  i&rsquo;ve driven on my western state trek&hellip;&rdquo;<br>
  i also remember how reading one item of this entry set off my insecurities and fear.  i was surprised and taken off guard. i didn&rsquo;t like the idea of you imagining, while you were still with me, all the women you would  have crushes on.  i acted out instead of saying how i felt straight up because i was embarassed and not sure i could voice such possesive and controlling desires  to you.  i was unsure of how to create boundries for myself.  what is asking too much of you?  how do i take care of myself without pushing you away?  stuff like that. it is something i still work on.<br>

ok this tells me that the way to live a happy, exciting life is to say &ldquo;fuckit! i&rsquo;m going!&rdquo;<br>

<p>Woah.</p>

<p>I just went to Kroger and saw a display sporting no fewer than six
(?) different communications companies, all with little prepaid cards
hanging from the display.  All the hanger things were the same size,
same shape, same <em>basic</em> look about them.  From companies AT&T
Wireless, Verizon, Cingular, something else, and some prepaid internet
company.  The internet company had some hangies that included a mini
CD with software and 60 "bonus" minutes, and some hangies that were
just recharge minutes with unique user/passwords.</p>

<p>So why not just scratch off the hidden username/password thing on
the card?  They have to be activated at the register.  Since when did
all these companies start talking?  Do they all have the same
activation process?  Kroger certainly wouldn't carry them unless they
made a pile of cash on each sale if they aren't super quick to
activate at the register.  So if it's a quick activation process, it
must be simple for the cashiers, and therefore I imagine not a
different process for each company, which means that somewhere, the
companies are all in bed together, or all talking to some common
distribution point or some shit like that.  So weird.</p>

<p>It's like a whole ton of companies (ton = six) are all teaming up
to make one big monopoly that officially isn't a monopoly.</p>

<p>Sean came over, preparing for Ultimate.  Somehow he saw that I was
wearing his ultimate shirt.  I was sleepin' and only the corner of the
shoulder was visible.  I'm so glad he was able to find it!</p>

<p>Just now he came back home (after having left with Jo, Jack,
Richard(?)) for the game; he forgot his cleats.</p>

<p>I'm in Janette's van, letting it warm up before I go to the Wolf
Shop to help with anti-war stuff.  Preparing for the rally in DC.</p>

<p class=date>3:32pm</p>

<p>Been silk screening posters after we ate lunch.  Taking Ann to her
house now.</p>

<p class=date>7:01pm</p>

<p>We probably finished 600 posters, each 1/2 poster size.  I've never
silkscreened before, and today I spread the ink stuff on 1 (one)
poster and did a pretty perfect job.  But I was way faster at loading
a new sheet of poster under the silk thing while Johnny would spread
the ink.</p>

<p>Several other people were there; we shared jobs of cutting posters
in half, loading them under the inker, inking, laying them out all
over the shop to dry.  600 covers a lot of space!</p>

<p>Oh, remind me to tell the story about Johnny the Blasphemer.</p>

<p>Maggie is so awesome.  She just called to let me know that though
we can't use a room at UH (they've been booked for a year for some
conference), we may find a great spot at Jillian's arcade
thingamajig.  Officially they kick out people under 21 at 10pm, but
she's going to do a bit more research on that to see thing like
<em>how</em> exactly do they kick people out, and who enforces the
kicking.</p>

<p>Then she told me a nutball story about a mutual aquaintence who is
hitting on Maggie in a rebound relationship crazy thing that Mags is
just like "no way Jose" about.  Man.. too weird.</p>

<p>The <a href="/sf/">Silent Football</a> rules are quite close to
complete.  I have all the basic rules, and all the wormhole rules.
Just need to write parallel universe rules and foot motion rules.</p>

<p>Special thanks to Jackie and Josephine for reading over them for
errors!</p>

<p>Jackie came over, brought Josephine from her dad's house.  Jack and
I had rented movies, so we watched <em>Death to Smoochy</em> at Joe's
recommendation.  We thought it was pretty good and cute and bizarre.
We all agreed that if we make a movie, we will have outtakes at the
end.  I was intrigued by the way the outtakes were also editted, not
just pasted together in one long string.</p>

<p>After the movie the girls trimmed Jack's hair.  Jackie considered
buzzing *some* of her hair, just a little trim off the top, but
decided against it.  "I'm tempted," she kept saying.</p>

<p>Just got a call from Johnny, who invited Jack and I to dinner to
see Robert Jensen, a really cool journalism professor from UT.</p>

<p>Jack is pretty pumped.  I hope he talks to him after the talk.</p>

<p class=date>9:19pm</p>

<p>Nice.</p>

<p>He suggested that another important thing we can be doing, besides
going to city council meetings, and going to rallies, and writing
letters, is just talking to people out in the world, especially those
who are in the 1/3 of the population that has a sense the war is
wrong, but can't really articulate why.</p>

<p>Two things to talk about:  short term - no war in Iraq.  That we
are being fed lines about fear of nuclear arms, and liberating Iraqis
and anti-terrorism.  But actually it's all just so we can control the
flow of the oil, and control the flow of profits from that oil.</p>

<p>And long term - no US Empire.  Has there ever been a benevolent
empire?  Absolute power corrupts; are we immune to this tenet?  Due to
the nature of our military, our taking over the world may be the end
of it.  Why are we the only nation pro militarization of outer space?</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Afterward, Jack went up to inquire about the cost of Robert's
book.  "How much is the book?"</p>

<p>"Twenty dollars."</p>

<p>Instantly, Johnny Wolf slapped twenty dollars on the table and
handed Jack the book.  Johnny Wolf rules.</p>

<p>For a day now, I've been working on writing up the <a
href="/sf/">Rules for Silent Football</a>.  They're not 1/2 finished
yet; probably not 1/4 finished yet, but I've shown some dedication to
getting them done now.  Maybe my Japan job confirmation has boosted by
enthusiasm some.</p>

<p>I have found that Sean's 50 foot ethernet cable is long enough for
me to type while enjoying the weather outside on the front porch.  Aww
yeah.</p>

<p>I'll be typing up Nick Carter and Ryan McCarthy's Silent Football
biblical passages now.</p>
