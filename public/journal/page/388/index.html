<p>I've got work today at the Wolf Shop!  Schlepping stuff from the
shop and warehouse to the Irish Festival.  We'll all be
Schleprechauns!</p>

<p class=date>4:50pm</p>

<p>Didn't shlepp anything at work.  Cleaned up sawdust, helped Hector
move some masonite around, hammered grommets into some fabric to hang,
went to a 6 day old Mexican cafe called Cafe El Toro I think, ate five
burritos for a dollar each, got a free slice of flan, and free sample
of their fajita meat, and talked to the owner guy who does not yet
have a license to cook food there, so he cooks at another restaurant
and carts it over here.  I spoke some Spanish with him.  Fun.  Back at
work I watched in amazement as Sergey created gray backpaint by
pouring every leftover color into one big bucket.  (No matter what
colors he poured in, it stayed gray.  Magic.) Back-painted some stairs
with Lisa, taped up a box, drove Lisa to her house, came home.</p>

<p>Today was Lisa's first day at the shop.  She seemed a bit unsure of
herself which I can understand. </p>

<p>Went for a walk with Janette to get myself outside and off the
computer.  Had made it 4 blocks when I stubbed the ball of my foot on
a broken curb.  <em>Ow!!</em></p>

<p>I couldn't tell without looking if it was cut or not.  I hoped to
use my mantra "no blood, no problem."</p>

<p>Looked at my foot to find a V shaped rip about an inch long on each
side.</p>

<p>Problem.</p>

<p>Well not so much a problem that I couldn't walk back, hopping over
the dirtier parts of the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Janette and I continued our conversation about things I've learned
since 1997 (discussion manifested since I'm converting those entries
on my site) a bit, but this is another long walk cut short by
injury.</p>

<p>Janette had left a note to Josephine including, "I won't fall."
Maybe next time she'll say "neither of us will be injured."</p>

<p>Cleaned it up, including tweezers to get a piece of bark out;
neosporin; gauze; duct tape.</p>

<p class=date>4:57pm</p>

<p>It still hurts.</p>

<p>On the way to Sean's Ultimate game, while we were mostly lost (with
bad directions, not a bad driver) a woman was all honking at us, for
no apparent reason.  She looked over, but didn't gesture like "hey
your car is on fire" or "you have three flat tires" or "you cut me off
you <em>bitch</em>," but just had a blank look like we should know wtf
she meant.</p>

<p>Wow.  Josephine just described all the verb tenses she knows in
French.</p>

<p>Last night we all piled into Janette's bed to watch a movie.  I
fell asleep in about 40 seconds, according to them when I told them
the last thing I saw.</p>

<p>I had a dream that I ended up next to Josephine and we were
yammering, but I was surprised that I could possibly have somehow
shifted to the other side of the bed and thought this must be a dream,
but I looked around and everything looked correct.  Including the wall
hanging (that does not exist above Janette's bed).</p>

<p class=date>1:30pm</p>

<p>We three are now seeking Sean and his ultimate peeps.  It's taken
us a while; they seem to have changed fields a couple times.  I dunno
exactly.</p>

<p>We've just found their field.</p>

<p class=date>1:43pm</p>

<p>As in, we just found the field where everyone had started, but
Sean's team was moved to a different set of fields due to rain.</p>

<p class=date>3:45pm</p>

<p>We got to see their last game.  Sean's team won with at hard-cap 9
to 8.</p>

<p>It was a pretty close and intense game; I enjoyed it.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Josephine is becoming a gas pumping expert.  This is her second
time to do it.  Sean is impatiently hurried to get to see his friends
playing in the finals.</p>

<p class=date>12:04am CST Sunday 23 February 2003</p>

<p>On the way to see <em>Grosse Pointe Blanke</em> (I forget which, if
any of these have Es on the end) Josephine was expressing a bit of
cynisim at the state of US and world politics.  I can't really blame
her; things seem pretty fucked up.</p>

<p>I've been digging back through my old 1997 entries, converting them
from static index format to a format that can be used with my
journal.pl script.  In the process, I have moved the 1997 rally
reviews from the SWD YRUU site on geocities to here.  The SWD YRUU
site seems to be finished; it lasted a few years and now seems that no
one is updating it.  So I want to get the reviews off it before they
vanish if the username is swallowed up by yahoo.  And before I roll
out to Japan I'd like to get my site stabilized, whatever the hell
that means.</p>

<p>Yesterday Janette made popcorn and I was all, "remember that scene
is <em>Grosse Point Blank</em> at the very end where the guy ran out
of bullets and is going to buy some and the other guy is like okay for
ten thousand dollars and he's all okay and then the good guy throws a
TV on the head of the badguy just as he says 'Popcorn!'"</p>

<p>And Josephine is all "yeah.  Oh, Grosse Point Blank is playing
tonight and tomorrow night at midnight."</p>

<p>So we're going.</p>

<p class=date>12:11am</p>

<p>Met two peeps whose names I didn't get because the cat up front was
giving away door prizes.</p>

<p>David and  Dana are behind us.  HI!!</p>

<p>Dana noticed that emacs has two "TOOLS" menus on the top bar and I
noticed that the second Tools menu has two Services items on it.</p>

<p>"What are those crazy Mac people thinking?" wonders Dana.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Cyndi Lauper onscreen before the movie: "HI, this is my new
video."</p>

<p>"If by 'new' you mean...."</p>

<p>Oh my lord we are laughing our asses off at this vdeo of True
Colors by Cyndi Lauper.  Holy shit this is hilarious!!</p>

<p>What are those crazy 80s people thinking?</p>

<p>"Wike a waaainn--bow..."</p>

<p class=date>2:31am</p>

<p>Yay for a great movie!</p>

<p>* It's Grosse Pointe Blank
<br>* The 'piece' was being sold for 100 Gs
<br>* Minnie Driver is cute</p>

hi rob.

i have been online since like. 7:30 i read
livejournals. commented. made brownies (not online) and then i was
thinking about how i wished that pics from the rallies were
online. and i know they used to be but the website has been
kinda... abandoned. and then. i had this... *REALIZATION* ::Êrob's
website has pics on it. i'm not saying they're super recent or
anything. but they're still nice to revisit. so pretty much, for the
last hour and a half i've been looking at pictures and reading your
journal. i like to revisit things. but i like even more to revisit
things from other peoples perspectives. its great to be able to read
your own journal and remember but even better than that is to know how
the people who were with you for those great times felt too. i like
revisiting things from your perspective. its so positive. it makes me
feel all good :) i feel that thing that all yruuers eventually
feel. its kinda... i dunno. the first few rallies you go to you dont
know many people, but the more you go to the more people you
know. your list of friends grows. then at some point it peaks. you
dont realize it at the time. but towards the end of your high school
career you realized that you recognize less people at every rally. and
you realize the decline has been in progress, you just didnt notice. i
noticed my lack of familiarity at houston. seems like no one knew who
i was. i spent most of my time with tanner, scottie, hunter, paul and
steve f. but really MOSTLY steve. we joked about him being my
boyfriend. it was funny. hilly was way grossed out. its strange. when
the most people you know are advisors. not bad. strange. i know its
time. to go. i know that you know the feeling. the sense that you'd
like to stay forever, but its time. i kinda regret not playing silent
football more, but at the same time. i was REALLY bad at it. and uh. i
was always asleep when you played. it just seems like this strange
little group. non exclusive but at the same time. a definate
group. with people who are in it and people who arent (like me). i
kinda wanted to be in it. but sleep is really really cool. you were
definately always there for me. and i love you. and i appriciate
you. very much. i'm sure people tell you that. but i really really
mean it. not that they dont. just sayin. i DO. you were the only
person who ever said thank you to me. it meant a lot. i've done a lot
of things for rallies, yruu, yac that i was sure no one knew about or
noticed. not like i was bitter. or i wouldnt have done them if people
didnt say thank you. but acknowledgement is one of the most wonderful
things you can do for someone. even when they dont ask for it. and
especially in a private, one on one sort of way. that's always stuck
with me. you said "thank you for all you do for yruu" i never
forgot it. i always wanted to tell you that. you definately made me
smile at times when i didn think i could. more than once. i know i'm
not the only person who felt this way. i just want you to know. that
we know. we notice you. definately. no matter where you go your home
will be in the hearts of all the youth who you've touched, raised the
spirits of, helped, guided, or just made smile once or twice. you were
my first vision of what yruu and rallies were. you were in OKC one
morning after a rally or something. you introduced yourself to
me. talked to me for a minute. there was a group of you on your way
somewhere. but i remembered it at my first rally. where you and bryan
were the only people to talk to me. your contact with me was less than
your contact with a lot of other people. so if i appriciate you this
much. just think of how much they appriciate you. woa. i
mean. WOA. seriously rob. so pretty much from now on i expect you to
know that you're great. ok. not in that stuck up "i'm so great" sort
of way. but in that subtle wisdom that great people have where they
occasionally think "i am good. i help" like that. :) so. know. and
have fun.

your hugs were always the best.
thanks for the sunshine.
i love you.

<p>Today I was pretty productive.  Deposited a check for Janette,
converted a $20 into 2 dollar bills, bought contact solution, got my
airline information finalized for Japan.  Leaving 26 March at 8:40am CST from
Dallas, arrive in Los Angeles at 9:59am PST.  Chill in the airport for
a second then leave at 11:10am PST from LA and arrive in Narita 11.5
hours later at 4:00pm JST (?) 27 March.</p>

<p>All for $714, including 1 meal.  Aright.</p>

<p>Shit.  I'm supposed to bring like $1000 cash to get setup there,
but I'm down to about $100, and down to -$2000 if I take into
consideration my debt.  Maybe I can work at Wolf Shop some this
month.</p>

<p>Been emailing/phoning with Fred; he's helping me some with my
website.  I'm trying to set up a cool way to basically prepend my
navigation buttons at the top of my pages.  I'm trying a technique of
using a script that takes as a parameter the requested
dir/ectory/file.html that a person wants, writes the navigation
buttons, then writes the results of a GET request of my own site of
that directory and filename.</p>

<p>But for some reason it's not really working.  I can return the
result of a GET request from google.com, but not robnugen.com.  Dunno
why.</p>

<p>Going to watch a movie now.</p>
