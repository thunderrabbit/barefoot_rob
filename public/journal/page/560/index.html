                        <p><title>Today</title>
<p class=date>2:02pm CST Saturday 10 March 2001</p></p>

<p>Today Wende and I repotted some plants, vacuumed the house and now
we're about to go to Maggie's to wash cars and eat dinner celebrating
Pices' birthdays!</p>

<p class=date>9:49pm</p>

<p>We arrived just as Maggie was finishing washing her car.  Then
Maggie, Molly and I helped Wende wash her truck, Butch.  It had been
dirtier than Maggie's car!</p>

<p>Played Star Wars Phantom Menace on Sega for a while and then dinner
was ready.</p>

<p>Dinner was super great with a great turnout!  Maggie, John, Molly,
Will, Wende, Rob, Meredith, Eric, Connie, Richard, Kerry, Earnest, and
Jeanine came after the rest of us had mostly finished dinner.</p>

<p>Dessert was awesome; Meredith made two kinds of cakes - angel food
with sugar icing and 3 layer chocolate cherry cake!  I asked her to
make a copy of the angel food for our wedding next year.</p>

<p>For unrelated reasons, Meredith asked if I could help her pop her
back.  It didn't pop just with a good hug squeeze, so I massaged some
kinks out and then adjusted it with her laying on the floor.</p>

<p>Eric and I talked about Avant Go to view HTML on a palm computer;
we will need to delve into that skillset at my work soon.  I may
replace my Handspring Visor with a wireless version.</p>

<p>Today was the last of 8 spanish classes for our
group.  We had been attending on Tuesday, but we moved
the last class to today so that our instructor can
visit her sick sister in Paris next week.</p>

<p>Last night I actually created some flash cards and
studied them 3 distinct times today.  I had a much
better time in class after that!</p>

<p>At the end we got diplomas to hang or archive or
recycle or whatever.</p>

<p>Spanish II starts on March 20th!</p>

<p>Today's class started with writing a postcard. 
Mine:</p>

<pre>
Hola Luz Clarita!  (*)             7 March 2001

Nosotros escribimos en papel hoy.  Te amo muchisimo.
</pre>

<p class=date>9:36 pm</p>

<p class=message>I interrupt this entry to relay
breaking news.  I heard a <em>*crunch*</em> outside
and realized a car must have been hit.</p>

<p class=message>I went outside and Jennifer had
backed out of her driveway and hit a parked car on the
other side of the (narrow) street.  People park there
all the time and we must be careful pulling out of our
driveways.</p>

<p class=message>She was okay and was about to knock
on neighbors' doors to see whose car it is.  She said
she didn't need any support from me so I came back
in.</p>

<p>Back to my postcard.</p>

<pre>
¡Hola Luz Clarita!  (*)             7 March 2001

Nosotros escribimos en papel hoy.  Te amo muchisimo.
Estudio mis tarjetas de spañol hoy en me trabajo.
Necesito comer esta noche con tigo.  Me elefante está
sobre la mesa.  Me gusta que estudiamos español para
nuestro vacaciones a Costa Rica.

       Con abrazos y besos

         la playa Manuel Antonio Costa Rica (!)
</pre>

<p>(*) Luz Clarita was Wende's name in the class
<br>(!) this was my (full) name in the class</p>

<p>Also today, we were given the following to
tanslate:</p>

<p>When I am happy, I sing, but today I am in a bad
mood. My cat is sick, the television is broken, and
this morning my coffee is terrible.  Today is Monday. 
I work at a bookstore.  Two people are in the store
now, a mand and a woman.  The man is tall and is
looking for books that don't exist.  Why is he here? 
The woman is short and very thin.  She buys the
newspaper here today.  Sometimes she reads five or six
magazines beforehand.  She always wears sunglesses and
a big hat.  She is very mysterious.  I believe that
she is a spy.  Who and why is she here?</p>

<p>Here is my translation, which contains some
errors.</p>

<p>Cuando soy feliz, canto, pero hoy estoy de mal
humor.  Mi gato está enfermo, la television está roto,
y está mañana mi café está terrible.  Hoy es lunes. 
Trabajo a una libreria.  Dos personas estás en la
tienda ahora, un hombre y una mujer.  El hombre es
alto y busca para libros que no hay.  ¿Por que está
aqui?  La mujer es baja y flaca.  Compra el periodico
aqui hoy.  A veces lee cinco o seis revistas antes. 
Toda veces lleva gafas de sol y un sombrero grande. 
Ella es misteriosa.  Creo ella es un espia.  ¿Quien es
y por que ella está aqui?</p>

<p>And just because I'm nice, here is the corrected
version:</p>

<p>Cuando <font color="#FF0000">estoy</font> feliz,
canto, pero hoy estoy de mal humor.  Mi gato está
enfermo, la television está roto, y está mañana mi
café está terrible.  Hoy es lunes.  Trabajo <font

aqui?</p>

<p>On the way home from Spanish, I noticed the marquee
at the movie theater was blank!  ????  <em>They *must*
just be changing the shows</em>, I thought, but I knew
it wasn't true.</p>

<p>I drove up, and all the removable stuff had been
removed.  No movie posters, no show times, no candy
behind the counter.</p>

<pre>
The theater has closed.  Thank you for
your patronage over the years.  Please
visit the nearby theater at ..  .....
</pre>

<p>Wow.  The truth, though, is that Wende and I hadn't
visited this theater lately, in favor of the stadium
seating theater that's further away.</p>

<p>Apparently a lot of people had that idea.  I wonder
if it will be opened as a dollar theater?</p>

<p>The <a

I offered last night is pretty much unusable unless one is on a high
bandwidth connection.  It displays all 248 thumbnails, 6k each on a
single page.  Because they are separate images, it takes at least that
mean HTTP requests, so the shit is pretty slow.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p></p>

<p class=dream>Driving Scott to the top of a building so I could try
to sneak inside just to say I did it.  I had access to the building's
interior, but I wanted to get in from the roof for some reason.  I
parked Scott near one corner of the roof near an old forgotten door
that had been sealed shut with piles of dirt sifted into its stairwell
over the years.</p>

<p class=dream>I tried looking for a different way in, but found
nothing.  I decided to explore down the forgotten stairwell anyway,
but found a bunch of spider webs and vines in the way.  I climbed back
out, using Scott to help me pull myself out.</p>

<p class=dream>I drove into a garage type thing on the roof and drove
inside the garage door.  I found an opening into the building from
here, but it was armed with an alarm.  I didn't even try to open it or
go near it for fear that there would be a motion detector.</p>

<p class=dream>I tried to figure out which corner of the building this
door would be inside the building so I could find it from the inside
and see if I could get *out* of the building through this door.  I was
memorizing what corner the door was in as I drove Scott out of the
garage.</p>

<p class=dream>It was getting light outside and the workers were
coming alive in the garage.  I closed the doors behind me with my
garage door opener(closer), but all three doors were open again when I
actually drove away down the ramp, with the garage doors on my
left.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class=dream>We were somehow inside a computer screen saver, watching
it do a repetitive calculation and drawing some marbles on the screen
as they rolled back and forth across a ridged target thing with like 3
concentric circles that were almost like ripples in a pond.  The
marbles would stop in the ripples, forming concentric rings of
marbles.</p>

<p class=dream>The computer calculations that were required to display
this graphic was too much for the computer to handle, so the image was
running really slowly and then even froze at a certain random point.
All the image was frozen and I could scroll around this 3-D world and
see finer and finer detail.  I saw there were images painted on the
wall, so I zoomed in on one.  It was a naked woman and I zoomed in on
her vulva, which resolved into such detail that the entire image was
from inside.  Because it was all computer generated, the image
resolved into a woman singing a rock and roll song with like stripes
painted on every surface, including her form.  It was like seeing the
world through the eyes of Neo when he was in the Matrix, except the
stripes were more like sugar icing poured in parallel lines over a
pastry.</p>

<p class=dream>I zoomed back away from the woman singing and the outer
image had come to life in a different scene.  We were in a boxing ring
and the main character woman was asked for sex for $1 by a guy and she
said "fuck you; I would crush you," or something.  She had no fear,
just disgust in her voice.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class=dream>I was skateboarding in a random downtown city and
skating down the wrong side of the street, near the median, waiting
for an opportunity to zip across traffic on the right hand side of the
road. A city bus passed me and was just about to stop, so I cut across
the street just behind it, in front of other traffic, and made an
attempt to grind a curb near a pet shop or La Madeleine or
something.</p>

<p class=dream>Another skater on the street saw my attempt to grind
and said "sup?" in a nice-to-meet-you kind of way.  I told him it was
my first time to ever grind on a skateboard.</p>

<p class=dream>His alarm started beeping, and I was all, "go do
whatever you have to do."</p>

<p>It was actually Wende's alarm and I woke up.</p>

                        <p><title>Dream: Ultimate at Rice, ice cream air force, Renee!!</title>
<p class=date>6:00am CST Monday 5 March 2001</p>
<p class=note>(dream)</p></p>

<p class=dream>Arriving to Rice campus by car, except the campus was
hilly terrain, and I was coming to play in the ultimate frisbee
tournament.  Duncan and Nathan were there (except Nathan's name was
Russell), and were already walking out to the field.  I helped Sarah
(KTRU DJ) carry some equipment out so we could have music playing
while were were playing frisbee.</p>

<p class=dream>I was rolling a cart of CD players and CDs, and it was
easier to just carry the thing instead of roll it because of all the
cracks in the sidewalk, and that the sidewalk was at a weird angle
since it was poured on the face of this hill, and there were broken
glass bottles on top of the CD players that I didn't want to drop.</p>

<p class=dream>I walked past a white truck that was the shape of an
ice cream truck, but had Rice Air Force advertising on it and a flight
simulator in the driver's seat.  This is how they attracted their Air
Force recruits.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class=dream>Locking a few of many many locks on some sliding closet
doors, which were the front door of this room place where I was staying
at someone's college dorm.  People asked if I was interested in going
somewhere else for graduate work, and I said some place in New
Hampshire, "it's wherever Renee went to school."</p>

<p class=dream>"Oh, yeah, Renee!" and it was Renee's room that we
happened to be in.  She was just coming back home after being out at a
haunted house in the country somewhere, but she didn't spend the night
there.  Too scary for her.</p>

<p>Work was cool today after the boring staff meeting.  I modified the
datasets of the sample project so that it can be used as a 360
feedback survey for a single individual.  It was relatively easy to do
so, but I had to make one code modification to turn <em>off</em> the
display of each user's password at the login screen.  The sample
displays the passwords, but a live version should not.</p>

<p>Super thanks to Drew for typing in all the names and email
addresses of the feedback providers!</p>

<p>After work I-group was cool; we got "back to basics" and followed
the four part structure that we used when we originally formed.  We
had veered from that structure over the years and some men had
expressed a desire to move back to the format.</p>

<p>At home, I ate Wende's leftover Vietnamese lunch, some icing from
her slice of carrot cake, and two things of yogurt as I set up a photo
album on photoworks.com of our <a
href="https://photomail.photoworks.com/sharing/album.asp?Key=7283496192300600">trip
to Australia!</a></p>

<p>This album is the easiest way for me to make one on the web,
considering they scanned all the pictures.  I still want to give some
of the images better captions and thumbnail them from my site somehow.
Due to storage space considerations, I'm not sure how I'll do
that.</p>

<p>(I was invoiced $19.95 for my storage space on this site, which
according to the invoice is 100 megs.  If I've used 100 megs, then I'm
surprised.  Maybe my space was increased??  I'll ask them.)</p>

<p class=dream>On vacation in a different city riding my bicycle in
the middle of the night, exploring  the city.  I found a water
fountain that was silent,  launching water lasers that made no noise
as they sprayed.  And they were large streams of water too, in a big
outdoor fountain.  All the streams pointing toward the inside of the
large circular fountain.</p>

<p class=dream>Back to the  hotel where we were staying and I wanted
to talk to the local fix-it guy because he would understand all the
life problems I was having.  I didn't want to smile too much around
Bryn because then people would think I like her more than everyone
else. I didn't get to talk to him though, and went to the cafeteria
and was eating, but he walked by and I motioned to him that I would be
in his office in five minutes.</p>

<p class=dream>I was asked to announce the winners of a contest by
determining who had the most M&M candies.  I started by calling the
groups who had candy different from M&Ms.  I asked the groups what
they had, and found ginger snaps to be the most unlike any other candy
in the room.  This room was large dining room with a kitchen in the
middle of it, so I couldn't see (or hear) everyone at once.  After
ginger snaps, I had sour gummy worms come up and then gummy bears.</p>

<p class=dream>Dane was leading a worship type thing with our
touchgroup, which included standing behind people in the group and
putting his shirt over their head and then lying on the table and
having a two-liter of ginger ale be poured over him.</p>

<p class=dream>I woke up while looking for a towel to prevent any
mess.</p>

<p class=date>9:02pm CST Sunday 4 March 2001</p></p>

<p>Today before our YRUU meeting, Amy and I played a 2 person game of
Silent Football.  It was all fine and good and pretty funny, but Amy
thought there should be more.</p>

<p>"We should invent some new ways to pass the football."</p>

<p>"Okay," I agreed.  "Go."</p>

<p>Now we have analogous moves, that only require the use of legs, no
hands needed.</p>

<p>These names are tentative:  A Foom is done by extending one's right
leg and making eye contact with the player.  A Fwazap is done just by
"clapping" the knees together.  (This is a non-directional Fwap, which
works for a two player game, but I'm thinking should only be used in a
real game after the direction has been specified with a Fwap.)  A Frug
is simply moving the knees up or closer together (an almost Fwazap).
And a Frotem is done by crossing the legs briefly.</p>

<p>We just incorporated these two offensive moves and defensive moves
along with the original Fwap, Zoom, Shrug and Shrotem.  No two
different defensive moves in a row, and the others are all fair
game.</p>

<p>Yay Silent Foot Ball!!</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>YRUU talked about the upcoming show - 23 March at 6pm at Tamina
Hall near The Woodlands.  5 bands for 5 dollars.  All proceeds go to
Children's Advocacy of Houston.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Got home and I took a nice fat nap on the couch.  Grrr to Spot who
wouldn't just sleep; he kept rustlin' around on top of me.  I tossed
him onto the floor.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Started working on my program and Laura called!  She asked if I was
down for some foodage at Souper Salad.  Awww yeah.  So I rode my
unicycle over there to meet her.  Made it all the way including across
a five lane street (no traffic) without dismounting.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>She came back to the house and I showed her the pics from
Australia.  The coolest tangent came from pictures of the Cathedral -
Laura described parts of the history of Catholicism and the structure
of the hierarchy, and described that prior to the meeting called
Vatican II, all Catholic mass was done in Latin.  Wow.</p>

<p>She said it will be a super interesting time in history when Pope
John Paul II passes; she predicts that a conservative Pope will be
elected from the ranks of the Arch Bishops, and if he is
ultra-conservative and tries to completely disallow women priests and
birth control and something else, then as a result the US American
Catholic churches will secede from Rome.</p>

<p>Hmmm.</p>

<p>All her stories were quite interesting to me; I am amazed and
impressed with her knowledge of the subject.  She says it's quite
interesting.</p>

<p class=dream>Watching a movie about chicago gangsters, who were in a
barber shop and they were making a business transaction with the
owner, and all seemed happy, but then the owner shot someone and then
they shot the owner like a hundred times and one guy started shooting
his machine gun into the customer area of the barber shop.  The movie
camera just showed his relentless face and the gun pointing just under
the camera's vision and rocking back and forth spraying bullets
apparently into the intended recipients.</p>

<p class=dream>Then the camera moved to outside the room and the
gangsters climbed out of the broken window, and the told the remaining
customers to keep quiet about this; it never happened.  Everyone
agreed to remain silent.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class=dream>Sitting beside Glenn from my I-group on his bed in the
bedroom and putting together his 5x5x5 rubik's cube, using an
instruction book.  There was a party going on in the other room, and
people had been arriving since we were working on the cube.</p>

<p class=dream>It was people from Telecheck, my old work, and one guy
came in and gave me a hug; (he reminds me of the character TV star
from 5th Element.) he sat down and inquired about the puzzle, but I
realized some of the pieces were missing.</p>

<p class=dream>So I went outside and found Bryn chillin' on some
bleachers in the front yard.  These were only about 3 seats high.  I
climbed up them and sat beside her.  She had written a letter that she
kinda showed me, but it didn't have my name on it.</p>

<p class=dream>"Can I read it?" I asked.  I wondered if I was allowed
to more than was I able to.</p>

<p class=dream>She handed it to me and showed me where the part was
written to me.</p>

<p class=dream>It was a picture and some introspective writing she had
written.</p>

<p class=dream>Then a helicopter overhead tossed a rope out its side
and a person started rappelling down.  She landed right inside the
helicopter seat of the helicopter that was already sitting in front of
Bryn and I, and tethered on one side to the balloon we were sitting
in.  (It was a hot air balloon, and we were in its gondola)</p>

<p class=dream>The helicopter woman flew away but since the helicopter
was still attached via tether to the hot air balloon, when she tried
to fly away we were all yanked along with her for a bit..  She tried
to climb up the cord and disconnect it, and I told her I could do it.
I got to the knot and couldn't figure out how to untie it and she said
just press it.  I pressed the knot and it unhooked itself.</p>

<p class=dream>She flew away and I had the hot air balloon as it was
slowly losing air.  It had a light bulb where the fire would be, as a
heat source, it was actually inside the bottom of the balloon.  The
balloon was mostly sealed, and full of helium instead of hot air. As I
moved the balloon around, it kept falling over and the light bulb was
touching the inside of the fabric and I was afraid it would melt it,
but it never die.</p>

<p class=dream>I was right beside my car and I realized I left my
lights on in the car, so I unlocked the passenger side door and
reached in to turn off the lights.</p>

<p class=dream>I took the balloon inside where Wende told me the
status of the party.</p>

<p class=dream>"Your dad and brother are working on some computer
thing (that they realized they can work on from home), and most
everyone else has left."</p>

<p>I woke up.</p>
