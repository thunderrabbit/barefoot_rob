<p>Got a text from Satoko, who got her visa, so she can go to Cali in
September!  Whoohoo for her!  I'm really excited; I think goin' abroad
is tha best way to learn a langauge.</p>

<p>Called her back to congratulate her.  And to also say I was like
"get out of here all you other voice people; I want to talk to
Satoko!"</p>

<p>I just sent 340,000 yen (actually (340,000 - 2000 yen) * [exchange
rate $/yen] - $10) back home.  I trust it went to the correct account;
I don't remember how the information was given to Lloyd's TSB; I think
I wrote it down for them.  Find out tonight.</p>

<p>The train is less than 1/2 full today.  I wonder why.</p>

<p>We got earthquaked today!  It pretty much rocked.  I could actually
feel a relatively high frequency vibration (like 20 hz) for a moment
before the quake hit full on.   I've felt such vibrations before and
dismissed them since there was no apparent earthquake.  From now on
I'll more likely believe they <em>are</em> the earthquake!</p>

<p>The big part of the quake lasted like 5 seconds plus residual
building rocking.  Pretty fun overall.</p>

<br>Hey, Rob.  I can imagine you riding the earthquake like a cowboy riding a bronco :).  Okay, so I've been in Texas too long, forgive me.  Little hard to follow all the office conflict, but I've got a general idea.  I've got similar stuff, but I suppose most people do.  Hope all is well.<br>

<p>Benny is making kids cards; I just ate a bar of chocolate and a
bento of those crescent ravioli things, the name of which I do not
know.</p>

<p>Sumika works so hard.</p>

<p>Benny now has three Pokemons on his bag.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Benny and I just explained our ideas of the differences between
"presume" and "assume."</p>

<p>During my last lesson, I explained Silent Football to Satayoshi, a
7A student with atrocious grammar.  That was fun.</p>

                        <p class=date>11:55pm JST Sunday 17 August 2003</p>

<p>Had fun tonight at the FAKNAT First Annual Kawasaki Nova Air-hockey
Tournament, most of which was spent at Warawara drinking (orange
juice) and eating random food items.  The whole night cost me 2000
yen, and everyone else between 3000 and 4000 yen.  Alcohol is
expensive.</p>

<p>Mike sat beside Rumi quite overtly flirting with her, which I
certainly understand, but I'm not as impressed with his motives, which
are, dare I snoot, worse than mine ever were.  "But what do I do with
them after I fuck them?" has been attributed to him.</p>

<p>Okay, enough of that.</p>

<p>I was in the first group who went to the air hockey fields.  Benny
whupped Olivia, then I beat Carla, which kinda surprised me, but then
I beat Benny, which quite surprised me (I had him 8-5 then he had me
9-8 then I won 10-9)</p>

<p>So I emerged the winner over the Northern Division (an arbitrary
designation to 6 of 24 names listed), but then . oh wait.. um, well I
played Ali and he barely beat me, but the game was out of order; he
was in a different division; I had to play Jen first, which I did (and
won), and then played Ali again, and this time he soundly whupped me,
or rather I scored several points on myself.</p>

<p>Lyle emerged as the winner of the Western Division, and the Eastern
Division winner dropped out after winning, so the final was between
Ali and Lyle, but Lyle had to "take care of some business" (Ali said
"do what you gotta do to sleep at night, mon") and never came back
during the night.</p>

<p>Back at the bar, I took lots of pictures, some of which I'll
post.</p>

<p>Found out that Carla knows ASL!!!  Wow!  So we signed a tiny bit
(what's yer name, and "have to be home before 10pm" (referring to
Detroit (which Benny pronounces as "de-troy-it"), not to ourselves)
and stuff like that) which was pretty awesome.  She got a degree in
ASL 7 years ago, and hasn't used it much since then.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I waited for Jen, Olivia, and Olivia to be done so we could all go
home together, but while in the underground mall, Olivia picked up a
small pile of cardboard flyer things and tossed them into the air.
Eeek.  That was too much for me; I left them.  Olivia texted me "we
lost you in the crowd; where are you?"  and I told her I was not
impressed with her antics and I left because I was embarassed to be
seen with them.</p>

<p>Then she replies</p>

<pre>
ok no probs- thanks
4 the honesty.  thats
cool. ill remember u
r embaressed of me next
time i want u 2 come 2
sushi, okonomiyaki etc.
thought friens dealt with
the bad & the good...

<p>o, Olivia.</p>

<p>Just watched a dumb movie with Frank.  He loved the movie.   This
is the second movie that he's loved that I pretty much didn't love.
The other one was okay, but not WOW.   This one was less than wow.
Just a bunch of cats talking.   But that's what Frank likes.
Talking.</p>

<p>But these cats were all being pretty mean to one another.  One plot
twist.</p>

<p>Work was aight today.</p>

<p>Yukiji and Satoko were both in the voice room when I had voice.
They yammered, both probably unaware that I've hung out with both of
them outside of Nova.  Hung out with is the key phrase; they both know
I have a girlfriend.</p>

<p>Satoko is the going to Cali; she's the one Sally foffered to say HI
to once Satoko is settled.</p>

<p>After voice, I had Yoshie man to man.  Now she has my address.  (I
told her I have a girlfriend.) She likes rollercoasters, and one day
rode Fujiyama 9 (nine) times in a row.  Sweet.</p>

<p>Sweet.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Now I'm on my way home to change clothes before going back for the
great First Annual Air Hockey Championship of Nova Kawasaki.</p>

<p>Got a tad pissy at work because Rich (who is already fired because
he complained that I wasted five minutes of his lesson by telling the
student the wrong thing "He said his name is Joe,"), complained that
he didn't have any free lessons on his schedule today but other people
did.</p>

<p>Cory decided that was a good enough reason to move free lessons
around to make it fair for people.  I was like, "meh, whatever;" I
didn't have any free lessons and I wasn't being a big baby about
it.</p>

<p>So, okay, fine whatever.  The schedule was rearranged so that
everyone had a free lesson and blah blah blah shut up.</p>

<p>Oh, and this is the part that like, stuck it to me: Cory and I were
having a conversation, talking about *FAR* more interesting stuff than
whether a pissy whiney baby has a fucking free lesson or not (We were
talking about the incredible complexity of the human mind that can
effortlessly catch a flying object (among fifty million other things)
and Cory had just begun a new thread, "and the human eye - what the
hell is that?  How does it a"</p>

<p>"Cory, look at this: there are two level five students in my lesson
and two level five students in Eric's lesson.  They should be
combined."</p>

<p>And I'm thinking, "SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU STUPID WHINEY ASSHOLE, WE
WERE HAVING A CONVERSATION!" All three of us were on lunch; Eric was
also on lunch and had just planned for his two lessons.</p>

<p>So Cory went up front (and I'll never understand why he didn't give
all four students to Rich) and gave the four students to Eric (who
therefore had to plan a new lesson, taking into consideration the
needs of the new students), during which time the true and supposed
motives of Rich came to light.  I was like, "so why does it matter?"
and he basically said so it's better for Nova; more students can book
a lesson if there is an empty lesson available.  (( and I'm like
<em>FUCK Nova</em>; so what? )) and then Eric said, "so will you teach
the four students?"</p>

<p>"Actually I was hoping they'd be given to you."</p>

<p>What an asshole.</p>

<p>So Eric spent more of his lunch hour replanning the lesson while
Rich continued to spout off rationalizations covering his guilt.</p>

<p>An irony slash fucked up thing about this story is that *I* had a
free during that timeslot; students could book into my lesson.  The
way it turned out: two students did.  Any students for Rich?  No.</p>

<p>In other news, I have a quote of the day: "I like <em>all</em>
sports.  ... except winter sports."</p>
