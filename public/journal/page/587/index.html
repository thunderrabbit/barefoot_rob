<p><p>Renaissance Festival is crazy fun.  Meagyn as Sabriel the Fairy with
kitty purry noises and glitter and marbles to share.  The many booths where
money can buy 7 throws or 2 tosses or 3 attempts to use the hammer to ring
the bell.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>Cassie getting ice cream:  The register girl goes &ldquo;what would you do if I
don&rsquo;t give your change back?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Scream and raise hell until you do.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Okay, do it anyway&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Cassie: &ldquo;HEY THIS LADY WON&rsquo;T GIVE ME MY CHANGE!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Okay! Okay!  Here you go!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>She didn&rsquo;t expect that.  hahhaaha!!  Good job, Cassie.  ;-)</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>Watched the English vs Scottish muddy olympic games.  Almost crude, but
not too much so for the kids.  ;-)</p>

<p><p>All the shop owners flirting hard for a buck.  &ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ll give you 7
axes for 2 dollars.  It&rsquo;s a great deal!&rdquo;  (That was axes to throw, not for
me to actually purchase.)</p>

<p><p>- -</p>

<p><p>When it rained, Cassie, Amy and I all got on a big bench swing and yelled
and sang in the swinging rain.</p>

<p><p>The maze was longer than I thought; we had been following the left-hand
wall when Cassie found a shorter way out.</p>

<p><p>Meagyn again performing different accents for us.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m supposed to be
Scottish, but everyone around me is English, so I just do English.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I spoke with Shiloh, a long time friend of Kathy Fey&rsquo;s.  I had never
previously met him.  Big guy.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;re seated in anticipation of the Ded Bob show.</p>

<p><p>Pretzels being sold &ldquo;Just smile and wave if you want a pretzel; I deliver
to even the muddiest places.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon people, they&rsquo;re pretzels, not wetzels.  These are dryer than you
are.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>3:26 pm</p>

<p><p>Ded Bob show now.  I&rsquo;ve read about it online, but never seen it.</p>

<p><p>Ded Bob show was pretty funny, but certainly not worth a huge loyal
following.  I don&rsquo;t think so.  But hey.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ll probably be back before another 10 years goes by.  That&rsquo;s about how
long it&rsquo;s been since I had visited previously.</p>

<p><p>Whooooo!!!</p>

<p><p>I just rode my unicycle from the stadium parking lot to the Rice Student
Center!!  Didn&rsquo;t fall once, including going up and down some sidewalk ramps
and through puddles (with no scum at the bottom)</p>

<p><p>I was quite winded when I got in to the station.  Aww yea.</p>

<p><p class=date>9:05pm</p>

<p><p>KTRU was fun today; I got 1 phone call in the first 1.75 hours of my
show, and then 6 phone calls in the last 15 minutes.  True story.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m about to unicycle back to my car.</p>

<p><p class=date>9:18pm</p>

<p><p>Aww yeah.  I only fell once, and that was when I hit a big bump in the
sidewalk.  I climbed back on and rode the rest of the way.</p>

<p><p>I went to Dude&rsquo;s house tonight to say HI and he showed me a game he
has called Drivin&rsquo; Madness or something like that.  It&rsquo;s a car driving
game that has a mode called Cruise so I have unlimited lives..  I was
driving a double decker london bus through the streets of San
Francisco, smashing into cars and cops and pedestrians and trees and
grass..  so much fun to help relieve my grrr about the ticket today.
Thanks, Dude!</p>

<p class=date>8:00am CST Friday 3 November 2000
<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>Some people at KTRU were trying a new interview type
format and I happened to be in the station.</p>

<p><p class=dream>The station was in a big long room with lots of windows
on one length of it and all our CDs along the other length and tables
along the window side of the room.  The two people had microphones and
were doing an interview of sorts.  Not really a directed interview,
but just asking random questions.</p>

<p><p class=dream>We were seated at one of the tables and they were using
portable microphones to speak.  I grabbed a mic just in case I could
chime in with something funny etc.  Then the interviewee started
speaking really softly and the signal was not even registering; the
transmitter was not broadcasting a signal that it could not hear.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I tried to whisper that to the person to have her speak
up, but she didn&rsquo;t speak louder.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Someone else came into the room and was all, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
to talk to the new DJs [over the air]&rdquo; and Maia was beside me and made
a comment under her breath, &ldquo;well you can just wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>- - oh yeah</p>

<p><p class=dream>We had walked into the room and found candy and cake in
the trash can from the previous night.  We had been walking around on
Rice campus and then just walked into the radio station.  Then they
did the interview thing and all that.</p>

<p><p>- - back to the story</p>

<p><p class=dream>There were even more people in the station and they
were still not being broadcast.  So I just busted in.  &ldquo;Okay, so that
was a great interview&rdquo; and the display for the transmitter output
signal blinked; the transmitter had turned itself off.  &ldquo;Ah, so I see
the transmitter was down for a bit; sorry about that; it&rsquo;s our first
interview to do in a while.  So we&rsquo;re about to get some music on for
you, hey someone put on some music!&rdquo;  As there were a whole bunch of
people in the station by now and music was being played even before I
could really finish my sentence.  So I was all, &ldquo;thanks!&rdquo; and turned
my mic off.</p>

<p><p class=dream>We were all walking around after that; I changed the
whole energy from quiet to walkin around talking and Amy was tehre</p>

<p><p>- - oh yeah</p>

<p><p class=dream>When we had first walked into the room, we were in line
and Meg..</p>

<p><p class=dream>we were at an ATM, getting money out and we only had
100 dollars in the account but put some more money into the account so
that we could get more out of the ATM.  Meg and Katy walked up, except
it was a smaller younger version of Katy.  Then we saw the candy and
cake and then the whole inteview as above..</p>

<p><p>- - back to the story</p>

<p><p class=dream>After I saw Amy I was all, I&rsquo;m going to write this
down, but I don&rsquo;t have a computer.&rdquo;  Doh.  Then &ldquo;ah..&rdquo; I remembered&rdquo; I
have my Visor&rdquo; so I got out my visor and was hooking up the keyboard
to it, but it didn&rsquo;t seem to lay flat for some reason.  I was just
about to type anyway when Wende woke me up.</p>

<p class=date>9:32pm CST Friday 3 November 2000</p>

<p><p>I just unicycled to the bank and back.  I fell once on the way
there and twice on the way back.  On the way back I fell once when I
rolled through some water with slimey slime in it.  The wheel slipped
sideways out from under me.</p>

<p><p>This time my trek included me crossing <em>five</em> different
streets (actually 4 and I crossed 1 twice) <em>and</em> going over the little
speed bumps in the movie theater parking lot instead of around them.
Yay me!!!</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m not quite ready to unicycle to work, but soon.  Maybe this year
if I practice more frequently.  I considered going to see Wende at
work (and hope she hadn&rsquo;t left by the time I arrived), but I decided I
was too tired.</p>

<p class=date>9:23pm CST Friday 3 November 2000</p>

<p><p>Yesterday at work we were installing Win NT on a machine and got
the Blue Screen of Death.  Oh.  I already mentioned that.</p>

<p><p>I took the faulty machine into Electrotex, deposited checks for our
investment club, went back to work and Electrotex called me and said
it was working.  Hmm.</p>

<p><p>Back to Electrotex and sure enough, it was working.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The power switch was turned off in the back,&rdquo; he explained.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I know!  We toggled that switch back and forth and got nothin.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he recognized, &ldquo;the power switch is in front.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>On the front of the panel, next to the 3.5 inch floppy drive, is a
small square, flush with the panel.  &ldquo;That switch closes a circuit
with the motherboard which sends a signal to the power supply to turn
it on.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>It was too silly for me to be embarassed.  Three competent
professional computer nerds overlooked the switch on the front of the
computer.</p>

<p><p>Back to work I brought the computer.</p>

<p><p>In Dennis&rsquo; office, I used his label maker to make a label: &ldquo;ON&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I labeled the switch.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Did they just add that?&rdquo; he knew the answer had to be yes.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No.  It was there the whole time.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Wow!  I was just working on my computer and
<em>bzzzeewww</em> the power went off!  Fortunately, I
have my computer on UPS.  Unfortunately, the monitor
is only on surge protector, so I couldn&rsquo;t see anything
to shut down the computer.  Fortunately, the power
came back on before I lost battery power.
Unfortunately, Wende was outside a couldn&rsquo;t get in
because the electric garage door opener is not on a
UPS.  Fortunately, she got in once the power resumed.</p>

<h1><b><em>FUCK!!!</em></b></h1>

<p><p>Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck!!!</p>

<p><p>I just got <em>another</em> ticket while taking a short jaunt from work.  On the
way back I cut through a parking lot and dammit, there was a cop right
there.</p>

<p><p>Deep breath.  Relax.  I am still okay.</p>

<p><p>Bluh.</p>

<p><p>One irony is that my court date is set for the first Thursday in
December, which is when our investment club meets.  Apparently I can change
my court date though.  I&rsquo;ll do that.  Apparently I cannot take defensive
driving again for it.</p>

<p><p class=date>5:03pm</p>

<p><p>Awright, here&rsquo;s the longer version of the story.  I offer this so I may
describe blessings I have received.</p>

<p><p>Today at work I&rsquo;ve been working closely with Duane, who is pretty smart
with network stuff, to get our network set up the way we want.  I made a CAT
5 crossover cable, and we got two machines talking in a most pleasing way.
Next step was to install IIS (Internet Information Server) on one of the
machines.  During that process, we got the BSoD (Blue Screen of Death) and
powered the machine off and back on.</p>

<p><p>Except it didn&rsquo;t come back on.  The fan didn&rsquo;t spin on the power
supply&hellip; nothin.</p>

<p><p>So I took a moment to write the current state of our project so I could
resume when we got the machine back up.</p>

<p><p>- -</p>

<p><p>Duane and I shifted gears to talk to SAVVIS about getting a T1 line
installed.  Duane asked all the technical questions to make sure that we
could get a VPN (Virtual Private Network) set up between our main office and
our home offices.  He determined we could and we just need to decide what
fraction of a T1 line we wish to lease.</p>

<p><p>- -</p>

<p><p>Duane left to go do whatever Duane does when he&rsquo;s not here.  I left with
the presumably faulty power supply to have it diagnosed.  Just down the
street is a electronic parts store and to my surprise, they said the power
supply was working fine.  Hmmm.  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s great!   Well, actually it&rsquo;s not
because that means something else is wrong with the computer&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>- -</p>

<p><p>Just further down the street is my eye doctor&rsquo;s office.  One blessing is
that my work just got new insurance and my eye doctor is on the list!  I&rsquo;ve
been seeing (no pun intended) her for years, even when my insurance wouldn&rsquo;t
pay for me to go there.  Now insurance will pay again.</p>

<p><p>I went in to say HI and Mary said, &ldquo;lemme see those glasses&rdquo; and in 5
minutes had new temples put on and they are like new!!!  So great!!  I told
her about Wende and my house, about our wedding plans and all that good
stuff.  So great to connect with her.  Mary told me that she&rsquo;s looking for
another job.  I encouraged her to simply set a thankful prayerful intention
that the perfect job would come to her.</p>

<p><p>- -</p>

<p><p>Blessings to her and like-new glasses to me and almost back to work and a
car stopped at the light and I turned into the parking lot.  Then I saw the
cop.  Dammit.  I tried to fake a turn like I was lost, but it was a dead
end, so I went back off the parking lot and saw his lights go on behind me.
Doh!</p>

<p><p>Stopped and got a ticket.  Fuck fuck fuck.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you see me?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I saw you after I did it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>- - - - - - - - - -</p>

<p><p>So that&rsquo;s the story of how I got the ticket.  As I played the whole thing
in my mind, I decided to write this entry, which reminded me that I have an
entry in my Visor from <a
href="/cgi-local/journal.cgi?dir=2000/10&file=30pastLife.html">Monday</a>!!</p>

<p><p class=date>5:28pm</p>

<p><p>I just added the Monday entry.</p>

<p class=date>3:01am CST Thursday 2 November 2000</p>

<p><p>Today at work I added functionality to the project of our good
client that allows the administrator to add participants to the
database.  I tested it on my machine and moved it to the production
box, but didn&rsquo;t actually test it there.</p>

<p><p>I spent several hours getting ready for our investment club meeting
which begins in 16 hours.  I think Wende and I put it off so much
because we really don&rsquo;t know how to properly fill out the forms.  I
will take a tutorial class thing on how to fill them out.  I know this
is simple stuff, but it&rsquo;s the kind of stuff that&rsquo;s simple after I&rsquo;ve
done it once.</p>

<p><p>As we left my work, I discovered that my car wouldn&rsquo;t start.  I had
left the lights on.  I&rsquo;ve left them on plenty of times before, but I
had always previously noticed them on as soon as I exit my car.  Not
today.  I pushed pushed pushed Scott up the slight incline and then as
Scott gained speed down the other side, I climbed in, but knocked off
my glasses in the process.  Essentially blind, I pushed in and popped
the clutch, but it didn&rsquo;t start.  I hadn&rsquo;t turned the key to On.</p>

<p><p>Stopped Scott at the street, went back and found my glasses.  They
were bent, but wearable.  Fortunately Wende was still there so we
jumped Scott&rsquo;s battery.  A simple task for the big engine in Butch.
(Butch is the name of Wende&rsquo;s truck)</p>

<p><p>I discovered that my radio presets had been lost with no power, so
I reset those on the way home.</p>

<p class=date>2:57am CST Thursday 2 November 2000</p>

<p><p>On Tuesday, I wrote a couple of screens that allow administrators
to see what percentage of people have finished a given survey.
There&rsquo;s a database behind the screens that tells which survey results
they may see.</p>

<p><p>I took a break during the day and rode my unicycle around the
building.  This is an incredible feat compared to when I first got
started riding!!  I was quite impressed with myself.  This ride
included going up and down slight inclines and somewhat controlled
turns to not hit cars.  Good job me!!!</p>
