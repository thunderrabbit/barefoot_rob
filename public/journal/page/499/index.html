<p>We have just taken the train to Monument station and used the public access terminal for internet.  I wrote a nice message to peeps at work and I lost it due to not being used to the keyboard.  And there's no CTRL key so I couldn't do CTRL-Z to get it back.  Doh!</p>

<p>The keys are stainless steel hardened for abuse and fairly tought to press.  harder to press than a telephone key.  but much thinner.</p>

<p>They ahve single keys to type 'www.' and '.co.uk' and '.com' and ':-) and ':-('   Pretty funny.</p>

<p>Okay we're going.</p>

<p>We are planning our day for tomorrow; our first full day in London.  London Dungeon, Tower of London, London Eye, Big Ben, Hyde Park</p>

<p>Matt is talking about a big ass gold statue that  we can see at Hyde park</p>

<p>Bryn and I have decided one of the cultural differences is that these guys are more active in their hanging out, including table tennis, guitar,  random wrestling, and a just more relaxed atmosphere.  I'm not convinced that it's an entire cutlure moreso than just the sub-groups that we are used to.  It's quiteresting thought.</p>

<p>I need to send my pics to Tanja</p>

<p>The table is close to the exit door of the loo, so people have to knock before the come out of the loo.  funny.</p>

<p class=date>11:45 pm </p>

<p>It's 5:45pm on Friday in Houston now.  wow. I could still be at work on Friday if I weren't here.</p>

<p class=date>1:35am</p>

<p>by this time the house had mostly fallen toslep; I had been sleeping on the couch for an hour or so.  Two mattresses were extracted from a storage shed or some such and added to the decor downstairs.  This is a cool old three story house with maybe six bedrooms on the second and third leels and just living room dining room, and kitchen downstairs.  Bryn and Tanja slept upstairs on the third level on Graham's single bed.  Graham slept on a mattress down on the first floor.</p>

We had just arrived and were invited to the pub.

"Umm, errr, maybe"

"The van is about to leave right now"

"Okay," and we went outside to see this van

"Girls in the front and guys in the back"

You shoulda seen this van - it was a lawnmowing service van, and it had
serviced its share of lawns.

So funny trying to hold on all the way to the pub!

dark! wet!

<p>Bryn arrived relatively late, but we boarded even later, so it was no worries whatsoever.  'We're going to London, mate!' is our most used phrase.</p>

<p>While we were on the runway, the video screen was displaying our groundspeed and time to destination and it was *completely* inaccurate.  It looked basically like it was the data from the previous flight into Houston, and it believed there were 19 minutes remaining in the flight.</p>

<p>'Only 19 minutes!  Whoohooo!!'</p>

<p>Bryn quizzed me on all my Japanese hiragana flashcards.  I know most of them, but it's quite apparent that I haven't studied in a while.</p>

<p>The movie of the night is Serendipity.  The amazing thing is that we each have a video display imbedded in the seat back in front of us.  I'm listening to the Continental Dance mix.  It's pretty hoppin' techno stuff.</p>

<p class=date>8:27 pm</p>

<p>This is the lap of luxury.  (I don't think I've ever used that term before)  Check this out: </p>

<p><ol><li>Bryn's travel agent Rosemary put us in seats A and C, leaving B empty in between us.  She theorized correctly that no one would end up sitting there; we have an extra seat!  (I told Bryn I'll send Rosemary two postcards for all that goodness!)</li>
<li>We can watch one of 8 different channels, listen to one of 15 different audio channels, or play one of 10 different games.  But I can't play a game and have the audio that I want and play the game at the same time.</li>
<li>But(!) we have an extra seat.  So I am listening to the Continental Dance (ambient trance now) on the empty seat and I'll play the game on my video display.</li></ol></p>

<p>See?  The lap of luxury.</p>

<p class=date>10:09 pm houston time</p>

<p>Bryn and I are tching a bizarre ideo thing animation called Loves Me Loves Me not.  Totally bizarre. by Jeff Newitt.</p>

<p>We watched the end of a silly movie about snowboarders on Bull Mountain with Lee Majors starring as the corrupt businessman.</p>

<p>Bryn and I have been sleeping for a bit, like a small puppy pile at a rally.</p>

<p>Thing is, the seats are tilted back, but the arm rests don't go as far back.  So one thing that is relatively comfortable puts the pillow against the raised arm rest.</p>

<p>It's apparently 7am London time now.  I'm going to sleep a bit more; we have a bit under 3 hours of flight time left.</p>

<p class=date>2:48 am = 8:48am</p>

<p>breakfast now on the plane.  There is snow outside on the ground.</p>

<p class=date>12:30 pm 15-3-02</p>

<p>We waited for quite a while but never saw her.  Finally decided to go upstairs to look and found her immediately.  Now we are at Garfunkel's Bar and Restaurant to eat fish and chips.</p>

<p>I'm chillin' outside my apartment complex now.  I've officially left work and I think they'll be pretty able to cope without me no problem.  I wrote a prett long explanitory email of te status of the projects I've been working o.  Cool.  I just called Wende to see why she's late, but she reminded me that we had agreed upon 3:30pm, not 3.</p>

<p>I'm just so thrilled about this trip that I'm ready early!</p>

<p class=date>4:40pm</p>

<p>I'm at the gate at the airport.  Traffic was no problem at all, and during our trip I systematically tried to guess the 3 digit code of the lock we used for our luggage in Australia.  I got the code after 100+ attempts.  372.</p>

<p>No problem getting through the security.  This time I didn't freak whe I sa the guns.  Butt I did smile to myself as I thought, 'how'd you get <em>that</em> in here???'</p>

<p>It's faster for me to put my Visor and keyboard in my bags becuse I don't have to shw it to anyone and don't have to unpack and repack my pockets.</p>

<p>I'm at Gate 11, at the far end of the International terminal.  Buut I'm healthy and strong and I ca walk it no problem.  I enjoyed the moving sidewalks, not just for their movement, but for the memories of David ad I oing to Ohio and playing on thtem, plus my long Koosh Joke, which I told to David and Amy and Hethre on the way to Austin Rally.</p>

<p>Interesting to begin the European immersion.  I see a lot of European facial structures, and hear some accents.  Fun.</p>

<p>I shoulda brought water.  I'm slightly hungry; I'll go get a snack.</p>

<p class=date>5:04pm</p>

<p>I've now had an orange/pineapple muffin and orange juice for $4.78, twice the price I'd pay outside.  Wow.</p>

<p>Should see Bryn in about one hour.</p>

<p>This is my third international flight as an adult:</p>

<p><ol><li>Costa Rica in Nov 1997</li>
<li>OZ in February 2001</li>
<li>UK and France in 2002</li>
<li><em>Japan 2003</em></li>
</ol></p>

<p>I wonder if we will need to show our passport to use the Chunel from UK to France. I doubt it, but I hope we do so I can get one more stamp in my passport.</p>

<p>I find it interesting that I'm anxious to get stamps in my passport.  I wonder if I'll be as excited in 5 years.</p>

                        <p>we&rsquo;re on our way.  excuse typos as i am half in the dark and not taking my time.  rob is watching different goofys&rsquo; (?) battle it out on the football field.  i&rsquo;m really impressed by the plane so far.  the flight is not entirely full, and rob and i were le
ft with some breathing room which is cool though we did miss out on making new plane-friends, but like fight club, they end when you grab your bags.  i was thinking today about how i&rsquo;ll tell my children, or al children&hellip; anyways, how our generation will tell our kids about airports &lsquo;back in the day&rsquo;  the kids will never understand the signifigance of <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> kind of like we don&rsquo;t understand the signifigance of the world wars,  they have just beAn related to us through policy changes and cool memorials we are just supposed to understand.  and this is just another one&hellip; &lsquo;i remember when people could wait just outside the plane to meet their loved ones, but after <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub>, they had to make airports more secure.&rsquo;  i almost remember (by almost i mean vaguely) remember in california, when we would visit our grandparents, we had to like&hellip; wait behind a gate and people would be pushing and crazy stuff all over the tarmac.  think what &lsquo;they&rsquo; would do now if people were pushing each other on the tarmac.  crazy.  i did tech with a guy at school last week who had just goten back  from a 9 week suspension because he told his friends how easy it would be to sneak a bomb into our school,  its still just as easy, but he got to take a 9 week &lsquo;holiday&rsquo; because of it.  weird.  i don&rsquo;t know if this entry has any real relevance to our trip, but its what i started thinking about, and like Joyce we just gotta write what comes to our minds.  -rob is going to brush his teeth? anyways&hellip; i&rsquo;m really excited abut this trip, scared a lot, but excited more  i cn&rsquo;t believe i get to see tanja&hellip; i&rsquo;m living in a dream, i keep asking myself why i&rsquo;m so lucky, why everything has to be so good.  i guess i just smile and know that somewhere it is right.  =)  i&rsquo;m seeing my typos now for the first time as i look up from the keyboard.  oops.  i can see my face in the tv screen in front of me.  i wish i could turn it around, or see the people watching me through the camera on the other side!<br />
     back to thinking about war&hellip; only because i can&rsquo;t seem to shake the confusion, and the awe i&rsquo;ve felt ever since i saw &lsquo;we were soldiers&rsquo; last weekend&hellip; i just&hellip; can&rsquo;t believe it.  like, sitting in a damnmovie theatre in okc, all i have to do is close my eyes, or walk out, and its gone.  if i choose, i never have to think about it again.  a lot of people do i think.   but my  god.. how can anyone see something like that and still be able to justify war? i&rsquo;ve written a lot about this in my own journal, and i don&rsquo;t know if its appropriate, but i can&rsquo;t stop thinking about.  i can&rsquo;t sympathize, i don&rsquo;t even have the nerve to say i EMpathize.  i will never understand.  who are all those poor soldiers dying for?  for my safety, for my freedom for my right to fly to bloody london for my spring break and type on a handspring visor made in a country where i&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ve massacred millions in the name of this flight, and for me.<br />
    some people choose to fight, i have to remember that.  some people want to die for their country.  some people do it because their fathers did it and THEIR fathers did it.  but not mine, and not me.  i can&rsquo;t&hellip; i can&rsquo;t understand.  if i had to go to war, i&rsquo;d have to hide behind a camera or&hellip; i don&rsquo;t know&hellip;   but i couldn&rsquo;t do it.  what fuckin right do <em>I</em> have to pull the trigger on another human soul.  the guy on my last flight (this jerky republican from houston) in one of our  more civil conversations said something like, &lsquo;your body is the software and your soul is thehardware,&rsquo; but i may have that wrong (i know little about computers) but whatever that means&hellip; people have souls.  and what makes my soul different from someone from new york, or new delhi, or wherever.  i can&rsquo;t think of anything.  so maybe i will always be lost and cofused.  maye i will never understand war.  oh well, i&rsquo;m done.</p>

<p>We've been totally fun throughout the day today - after fish and chips at Garfunkle's bar we had quite an adventure getting train tickets for Tanja so she could ride the same train as Bryn and I.</p>

<p>Bryn, we're in London!</p>

<p>Free internet terminals in te airport, but I resisted the temptation to check email and write an entry.  50p for fifteen minutes at a different terminal, so I didn't even consider it.</p>

<p>Cool thing to step out of the train station and see that the area we were in <em>used</em> to be outisde, but has had a big ass roof built over the whole operation.  All the storefronts were outdoor brickwork like the mall i OZ Daimaru or something.  I didn't take picutres inside except for the pic of the Sock Shop for Wende.</p>

<p>London seems cold and overcast and perpetually wet, so I love the humidity level, but it's too cold for my taste.</p>

<p>Met up with Graham and went rief shopping with him in the little neighborhood stores,news agency, chemist, grocery, etc etc etc.</p>

<p>We only went to two stores, and I stopped by the news agency to get post cards to begin writing.</p>

<p>Walked to Graham's house, which is more like a coop, with a bunch of people living here all doing their own thing.</p>

<p>Plyed some ping pong and then some cats were all, 'you wana go to the pub?' and we're all, um, uh, maybe, and then they were all, 'we've got a van right here; we're leaving now.'   'Okay'</p>

<p>So we put on shoes and walked outside to the van, a normal enough van in the front, and in the back, a bunch of lawn mowing equipment, covered in water and bits of grass.</p>

<p>What a fabulous grand adventure!  I almost busted my ass one time but then found a pretty secure way to hang on.  Lots of laughing, not knowing where we were headied, no windows, hanging on, light flashing, looking out the tiny pinholes to see random signage that was way far from where we had started.</p>

<p>Arrived at the pub and played about 5 games of billiards, but the difference is that instead of stripes and solids, they have just two different colors of balls.</p>

<p>to be continued<p class=date>12:59 am houston time</p></p>

<p>Bryn and I have been sleeping for a bit, like a small puppy pile at a rally.</p>

<p>Thing is, the seats are tilted back, but the arm rests don't go as far back.  So one thing that is relatively comfortable puts the pillow against the raised arm rest.</p>

<p>It's apparently 7am London time now.  I'm going to sleep a bit more; we have a bit under 3 hours of flight time left.</p>

<p class=date>2:48 am = 8:48am</p>

<p>breakfast now on the plane.  There is snow outside on the ground.</p>

<p class=date>12:30 pm 15-3-02</p>

<p>We waited for quite a while but never saw her.  Finally decided to go upstairs to look and found her immediately.  Now we are at Garfunkel's Bar and Restaurant to eat fish and chips.</p>

<p class=date>8:25 pm 15-3-02</p>

<p>Um, so two different colors of balls, and the balls and tables are 2/3rds the size of ours.</p>

<p>I was on a team with Doors (girl from NZ), and Bryn & Graham, and Tanja & Drew</p>

<p> Drew is far better than the rest of us, but Doors and I won 3 games in a row, two of which we won because the other team sank the 8 ball or other tchnicalities.  Oh, and they ae an 8 ball along with the 2 sets of 7 colored balls.</p>

<p>Walked back home because the van had left early.  Stopped by a bottle store to get some drinks.</p>

<p class=date>8:36 pm</p>

<p>Now we are back at the co-op house and Drew is challenging Matt at ping pong with 10 pounds each on the table.  est of 5 games.  Drew is winning 2 games to 1, and in this fourth game, his is winning 7 to 4.</p>

<p>Now it's 10 to 10.</p>

<p class=date>8:42 pm</p>

<p>20 to 20.  And Matt won  24 to 22.</p>

<p>So now it's 13 13 in the final game.  2 to 2 games..  22 to 20 Matt wins.!   Very close games.</p>

<p class=date>7:am CST Thursday 14 March 2002</p></p>

<p>In 12 hours Bryn and I will leave for London and Paris!</p>

<p>Whooohoooo!!!!!</p>

<p>I started packing around 6AM and am now chilling outside my work
because last night after Wednesday Night Dinner at Dude's (starring
Gene, Dude, Veronica, John, Alex, and me) I left my phone, visor &
keyboard.  Doh!  I realized it as I arrived home near 1am on my bike.
I chose not to go back out there whether by bike or car to wake them
up to retrieve it.</p>

<p>So I packed this morning with some questions as to how many pairs
of pants and how many long sleeve vs short sleeve shirts blah blah
blah - it's really unknown to me.</p>

<p>In my mind, I have messages like, "don't wear shorts; you'll look
like a tourist." and "Wear dark because it's dirty." and "It will be
cold and rainy" and "pack light; everyone overpacks." and "there's
lots of pick pockets over there."  "French people are rude and they
hate Americans."  All this (and more I'm sure) while I'm packing.</p>

<p>So I think I'm doing pretty well and I decided to come to work to
use the phone to call Dude to coordinate getting my stuff.  (*) But I
couldn't get into the building, not just because I didn't have my
access card (it's with my keyboard), but because the phone outside the
door which I should be able to use to call Drew said, "MEMORY EMPTY"
when I tried to use it. I laughed at the irony.</p>

<p>Dennis let me in when he arrived around 7:15.</p>

<p class=date>7:15am</p>

<p>I have reached Dude and Veronica; Dude will be there for a bit so I
can retrieve my stuff.  Hooray!  I'm thankful that this didn't make my
final leaving-day a huge chaotic mess.  I'm going now to get it and
finish packing.</p>

<p class=date>9:53am</p>

<p>Okay; I'm packed.  I'm back at work.  Tons of email flooding in to
process.  I'm working on version 2 of changes to the OS survey for the
peeps in Singapore.</p>

<p class=date>12:16pm</p>

<p>Okay, the changes for Singapore survey are complete; I just need to
move them to the test cluster.  I couldn't make all the changes, but
they are cost conscious and these other changes could take some hours
to do, or are undoable.</p>

<p>I've also written an email detailing the status of projects I have
been working on.  I think this should help everyone handle the load.</p>

<p>Still need to show Dave and Minh the code management system I've
been using.</p>

<p>2.75 hours until I leave!</p>

<p class=date>2:48pm</p>

<p>Okay; everything seems to be calm and tranquil.  I have all 3 of my
smartmedia cards for my camera, extra batteries for my camera and
handspring visor.  I cleared out all old entries and put a new one
online: January 6th "bicycle" which I don't think is online
already.</p>

<p>I'll be back on 26 March.</p>

<p>Bye!</p>

<p>STATE OF THE ART</p>

<p>Year of Living Geekily: Even the Dogs Evolved</p>

<p>By DAVID POGUE</p>

<p>OR observers of human nature, the end of
the year presents a golden opportunity for
spotting geeks in their native habitats.
Normal people pull tags off gifts; geeks put
batteries into them. Normal people spend the week
watching movies and reading newly unwrapped books;
geeks hook things up to the television.
Normal people make up New Year's resolutions like
"Clean the garage," "Learn French" or "Get
more exercise." Geeks pledge to "Clean up the
Web site," "Learn JavaScript" and "Get more
RAM."</p>

<p>While waiting for the computer to reboot,
we geeks may also pause to reflect on the industry
itself. For stockholders, this was the year that the
high-tech bubble burst with a definitive pop. And it
will be some time before venture capitalists back any
20-year- old with a clever PowerPoint pitch.</p>

<p>Even so, some fundamental truths still apply.
Prices continue to fall, as this season's owners of
$100 DVD players are happy to point out. Computer
power continues to climb (2-gigahertz processors),
even if many consumers already have more megahertz
than
they know what to do with. And manufacturers continue
to revise and improve their products with
disconcerting speed.</p>

<p>As evidence that the innovation engine is
still chugging along, you have but to consider this
column's topics over the last 12 months. Here is a
look at what has become of some of the year's most
notable products, updates that you can clip and paste
into your carefully archived originals.</p>

<p>NET APPLIANCES</p>

<p>Almost all the Internet appliances I
reviewed a year ago 
have
gone to that
           great Circuit City in the sky.</p>

<p>You didn't need a Ouija board to foretell
the death of 
3Com's
Audrey
           ($500). Its tiny screen could show only
part of a Web page; 
its
punctuation
           keys were mere slivers; and it offered only
a single e-mail
account for each
           machine. As for its rival, the Gateway
Connected Touch Pad
($600), you
           could have measured its Web-page download
speed in ice ages.</p>

<p>Only Compaq's IA-1 seemed to be poised for
success: it was
relatively fast,
           inexpensive and well designed. (A few
IA-1's are still 
available
at
           Walmart.com for $200.)</p>

<p>But just $600 could buy a full PC, with a
CD-ROM drive, a 
bigger
monitor
           and so on. The limited, awkward Internet
appliances simply
couldn't
           compete.</p>

<p>Only one device survives: Honeywell's
WebPad (now $1,970). 
It's a
           flat-panel touch screen that maintains a
fast, cordless link 
to
your cable or
           D.S.L. modem as you walk around the house
or office. Both 
the
price and
           the requirement for a high-speed connection
should tip you 
off
that this
           machine isn't aimed at non-techies.

           Funny, isn't it? The big companies had it
wrong. It wasn't 
the
everyday
           consumers who wanted Internet appliances.
It was the geeks.</p>

<p>DIGITAL PETS</p>

<p>Aibo the robot dog by Sony (news/quote)
was, and is, a 
remarkable
           machine. Useless, but remarkable. It can
walk on its own — 
seeing
with
           cameras, hearing with microphones, thinking
with software. 
It can
even learn
           new tricks.</p>

<p>But not everyone considered Aibo a steal at
$1,500. Within
nanoseconds,
           toy companies leaped into the fray with
their own models: 
copycat
dogs that
           did less but also cost less. Eventually
Sony's engineers, no
doubt sighing with
           resignation, set about the task of
designing an Aibo 
knockoff of
their own.
</p>

<p>The result was the new Aibo LM series
($850): cuter, 
rounder,
smaller dogs
           that still respond to vocal commands and
can "learn" new
behaviors. The
           cheaper dogs cannot send audio and video to
your PC 
wirelessly,
as the
           more expensive Aibo can when equipped with
a $150 software 
kit.
But for
           anyone who longs for companionship yet
doesn't have the 
energy to
care for
           an analog dog, the price for the ultimate
laptop has dropped
considerably.</p>

<p>MAC'S NEW CORE</p>

<p>With all the hoopla about Windows XP, it is
easy to forget 
that
there is
           another good-looking, super-stable
operating system gaining
popularity:
           Apple's Mac OS X.</p>

<p>The overhaul of OS X, version 10.1,
released in September, 
was so
           sweeping that it made the original look
like a dress 
rehearsal.
The current
           version is much faster, includes a long
list of useful 
features,
and restores the
           DVD playback and CD burning that were
missing from the 
original.
</p>

<p>Even better news is that by now, most
big-name programs have 
been
revised
           to take advantage of Mac OS X's beauty and
stability, 
including
Microsoft
           (news/quote) Office, America Online,
FileMaker, Illustrator,
Freehand and
           Final Cut Pro. Mac fans should take note
that it's finally 
safe
to make the
           switch, as long as they're prepared to pay
the upgrade fees 
for
the programs
           they use.</p>

<p>THE MASTER'S VOICE</p>

<p>For all the attention given to computers
that understand 
human
speech in
           sci-fi movies, it's strange how little
fanfare surrounds 
this
category now that
           it's here.</p>

<p>In any case, both leading Windows
speech-recognition 
programs are
           available in new versions. The chief virtue
of I.B.M.'s 
ViaVoice
Release 9, a minor upgrade, is its inclusion (in
           the deluxe version) of a U.S.B. headset
microphone that 
improves
accuracy. Naturally Speaking 6,
           meanwhile, is an ambitious merger of
features from the 
onetime
rival programs L&H VoiceXPress and
           Dragon Naturally Speaking.</p>

<p>The most impressive feature of NatSpeak 6,
however, is its 
very
existence: it was born during the public
           disintegration of its maker, Lernout &
Hauspie. Only two 
weeks
ago the company sold its speech software to
           Scansoft, so that NaturallySpeaking and its
descendants may 
live
on.</p>

<p>(There is also news for Mac fans: The last
few months have 
seen
the release of both ViaVoice for Mac OS X
           and iListen for Mac OS 9.2.1.)</p>

<p>DICK TRACY'S LENS</p>

<p>Casio's weird and wonderful Wrist Camera
($230) still shows 
only
shades of gray on the watch face when
           you take pictures. But the recently
upgraded watch (model
WQV3-1BNDL) actually stores color
           photographs (80 at a time), which you can
see when you later 
beam
them, via infrared, to your PC.</p>

<p>These pictures aren't what you'd call
gargantuan — in fact,
they're 176 by 144 pixels, just over two inches
           square. But when you need to be
surreptitious or 
spontaneous,
there's no smaller digital camera outside the
           C.I.A.</p>

<p>TUNES TO GO</p>

<p>Apple's iPod is a spectacular music player.
It holds 130 
CD's
worth of music in a
           white-acrylic-and-mirror-finish player not
much bigger than 
a box
of Tic Tacs. No MP3 player offers this
           capacity in anywhere near such a small
size, especially not 
with
12 hours of battery life.</p>

<p>But Apple said that the iPod could
synchronize its music 
library
only with Macs. Fortunately for PC fans,
           xPlay, a $40 Windows program being readied
for a January 
release,
will let you load your iPod with music
           and use it as an external hard drive for
your PC, just as on 
a
Mac. An early version is available at
           www.mediafour.com.</p>

<p>PIXELS' PROGRESS</p>

<p>The PC industry is no longer the youngster
it once was, 
exploding
with monthly leaps in sales growth and
           features. Nowadays, it's the digital camera
industry that 
behaves
that way.</p>

<p>The cameras I reviewed in 2001 are already
smaller, cheaper 
and
better. As noted last week, 2.2-megapixel
           models now sell for under $300.
Four-megapixel cameras cost 
less
than half what they did a year ago. And
           Sony's CD1000, which burns its images
directly onto 
mini-CD's,
ready for archiving or inserting into your
           computer, no longer requires $1,500 and a
wheelbarrow. 
Today,
Sony's CD200 offers about half the bulk
           and price ($800).</p>

<p>The lesson from the camera business is the
same one that 
we've
learned over and over again from the PC
           business, the VCR business and the DVD
business: The longer 
you
wait, the better the deal you'll get.</p>

<p>Of course, you know what we geeks would
say: Where's the fun 
in
that?</p>
