<p>I didn't have lucid dreams.  I did dream that everyone from school
was outside on some bleachers, and I leaned back on the top and it
dumped over.  6:05</p>

<p>6:35 Oh yeah, I dreamed that the comics were changed up.  Some were
taken out, some were new or all mixed up.  6:37</p>

<p>I had 2 bowls of Crispix for breakfast.  For lunch, I had a roll,
tea, and pizza and veggie sticks.  For a snack I had a piece of cake,
milk, slice of meat, and graham crackers.  1st pd.  Library.  I worked
on my paper more. 2nd I failed a test.  I have about a 50 in there.
3rd. We found out what is on our test tomorrow.  4th Oral grades.  I
got 18 out of 20. 5th Some jobs and a Timed Writing  6th.  Went over
test I got a progress report.  Today I found out that Christina's mom
is mad at her because we've only "been out" twice.  I swear her mom is
dumber than Christina.  It used to be that we were getting too
serious. What does she want??? Yesterday Christina gave me a matching
pen and pencil. They are nice, but the pen writes blue and the
pencil's lead is too big.  Today she gave me a list of 200 song
titles.  I don't know why.  I gave Charmain her "Beastie Boys" tape
back.  I borrowed it to copy it, but I didn't copy it. 4:15PM</p>

<p>No lucid dreams.  It's 5:50AM.  I dreamt that I was at a store
looking for Jams. Danny Dillard showed up and thought that was funny.
Next thing I know, I'm sitting with my back against a wall and a wall
is on my left.  There are some girls on my right against the wall.  In
front of me is an open area, maybe a store or a cafeteria.  Terra
Suter crawled into my lap and I had my arm around her and held her
other hand.  She turned into Vanessa Payne and started arguing with
the girl on my right.  I think <em>she</em> was Vanessa Payne too.
Wierd!  6:10</p>

<p class=date>4:20 P.M.</p>

<p>I started a scrap book just now.  Oh, wait, my <b>day</b>: I had 2
bowls of rice krispies and part of an apple for breakfast.  For lunch
I had a hamburger, a slice of pizza, and tea.  For my snack I had the
rest of my apple and some Graham crackers, milk, and some pepsi, and 3
slices of bread. <b>School</b>: English - we went to the library
again.  I'm working on a research paper over the Sapce Shuttle
Challenger.  We have note cards due Wed.  I have 2 done - we need 10
or 40.  I don't know which.  I declined my invitation to the Junior
Ring Ceremony.  I had already accepted, but realized the OKC rally
coincided with the Ring Thing date.  I had asked Lucy Proctor to
present my ring.  I felt dumb telling her that I can't go.  Second
period- we found out that we did terrible on our tests.  I got a 73.
We are going to have another tomorrow.  She (Mrs Roach) gave us a
little tiny cheatsheet. I bought my spuds Mackenzie poster today from
Linda Palack (sp?).  3rd period.  We did some problems with water.
Figuring out how much heat is needed to melt a certain amount of
water, and stuff like that.  4th - I have an extra credit project to
do for Spanish.  It is due Wed.  I have to write a ten page book in
Spanish.  I think I can do it.  I will work today on it.  I also need
to study Spanish.  I got a progress report in there.  I have a 70
average.  5th.  No problem.  We were assigned 6 jobs and I got 2
finished.  I'll do the other 4 tomorrow - no prob.  6th - I got back a
test.  I major failed it.  My raw score was a 9. 37 was passing.  I
must talk to him.  On the way home Charmain gave me a letter.  Then
she told me a hellacious story about her Spring Break.  It was full
of drugs and sex and terrible things.  I also found out that Erin's
party was changed to April 10.  Now it is the same date as OKC and the
Ring Ceremony.  Oh well.  I'll am determined to go to one of their
parties though.  Well, it's 4:50 I will write some tonight.</p>

<p>I had fish and potatoes and milk and angelfood cake, whipped cream,
strawberries.  Amanda called along with her friend Margaret?. We
talked for a little bit.  I told Amanda to write me a letter and to
get me a picture of Rachel, Amanda, and Margaret.  I want to go to
Astroworld!  The Cyclone has been "fixed up." I don't know what they
could do.  I've heard they put new cars on.  I need to get my license
soon.  I want to drive some to the OKC Rally! That will be fun!  Well
good night.  Lucid dreams beckon.</p>

<p class=date>March 29, 1987</p>

<p>I started this diary.  I wrote a lot!  This morning I had my first
semi-lucid dream, a start. It was in a grocery store.  I was trying to
get somewhere and Lynda Smith was in my way.  I was going to go around
her then I woke up a little.  I realized it was a dream and started
major flirting with her.  I eventually woke up all the way.  I took a
shower, went to church.  Only me, Emily, Cheri, Jenny and Andy were
there.  Emily was totally hyper.  I drew a picture of a lake with
hills behind it, trees and bluebonnets around it, mountains behind the
hills, and a river, and clouds.  It is to be given to a visitor from
another country coming to the IARF conference (International
Association of Religious Freedom).  I slept on the way home and just
wrote in here for the rest of the day.  It's 11:00PM.  I think I'll
sign off and start a new page tomorrow.  I hope to have a lucid
dream.  Starting tomorrow I'm going to write down all my meals and
start keeping track of my health- look for patterns.  Well, good
night.  Happy Dreams!</p>

<p>Saturday- sleep late.  Mom and Dad are gone. I didn't have a lucid
dream- try again later.  We are supposed to mow today.  We didn't do
much.  We watched cartoons and messed around all day.  We didn't get
into too much trouble, though.</p>

<p class=note>(this entry written 29 March 1987)</p>

<p>Hello!  This is my new diary.  I've had this book lying around in
my closet for a long time.  It's been waiting for a good use.  So now
it's Robert "Ted" (RoberTed) Nugen's Diary.  I'll need a name for it
later.  I need to tell about me.  No telling who may find this thing.
I was born March 25, 1970, in Fort Knox, Kentucky.  I lived there in a
trailer for about a year.  Then we moved to Columbia, Missouri.  We
lived there for about 8? years.  Then between 2nd and 3rd grades we
moved to a 2 story house in Spring, Texas.  There were railroad tracks
behind that house.  Then between 7th and 8th grades, we moved to
Tomball, Texas.  I'm still here.  I'll relate stories about the past
in all of those places and vacations I've taken and other stuff later.
I'm debating as to wether I should scatter throughout here as they
come or put them in a separate book.(*) Right now I'm in 11th grade at
Tomball high School.  I'm taking English III with Miss Carter, World
History with Mrs. Roach, Chemistry Honors with Mr. Hamm, Lunch,
Spanish II with Mrs. Sherman, Typing I with Mrs. Benefield, and
Algebra II with Mr Reagh.  They are all good classes.  Spanish and
History are the hardest.  I should be failing Alg. II, but I solved
the "carpet problem" and he is giving me a 90 for the year.  I need to
earn it, because next year I won't have carpet problems to fall back
on.  I'll describe the "carpet prob."  later.  Typing is incredibally
(sp) easy.  I'm averaging about 25 words per minute, and I don't even
have good style.  Next year I'm taking all honors classes except Art
I.</p>

<p>I started this diary for myself, mostly.  I often go on trips and
rallies and come back with lots of memories.  But, I can't get them
all in order, and that bugs me.  Most recently, was my Spring Break
Science Trip.  I have that about halfway in order.  I told a tape
recorder about it.  That is my "rough draft" I think from now on, I
will try to write down the days' events in here each evening.  Each
morning, I will write down my dreams.  For about 3 days, I've been
trying to have lucid dreams.  It may be a phase.  I hope not.  If I'm
on a trip, I don't want to take this with me.  I will have a smaller
note book to record dreams and events.  Even at home I think I will
write down dreams in a smaller book each morning and copy them into
here at night, just before bed.  Well, I guess that's all.  I'll put
guidelines about how to write in here.  Hey!  new idea!  this has page
numbers.

(*) I will scatter things throughout the book as I think of
them.  Anything not written in chronological order will be listed on
the page after this one.  How much should I put in here?  Do I care if
anyone reads it?  I don't know.  I'll think about it.  It would be fun
to write everything so that I may get in trouble if anyone else reads
it.  Well, skip that problem for now.  On to writing.</p>

<p class=date>My trip to Ink's Lake - Mar. 22 - Mar. 27, 1987</p>

<p>It was to be a fun trip.  We were going to go to Ink&rsquo;s lake, go
spelunking, canoing, rappelling, climbing, and a whole bunch of fun
stuff.  It was pretty fun. Now it is March 29, and I just relayed the
whole trip to a tape recorder.  Here&rsquo;s how it went:</p>

<p>We left Tomball, A
little late, but we left.  All our stuff was cram-packed in the back
of the bus.  I was in the furthest seat back with Wade Johnson.  We
were talkin&rsquo; and listening to tapes and stuff.. just messing around.
Then 3 of the girls decided to take a nap on our stuff.  Throughout
the trip, it got more crowded back there every day.  It was Pam,
Renae, and Beth who went back.  I&rsquo;m going to go through the trip
faster than this.</p>

<p>We rented canoes along the way; while we were
there, we chunked a little pink cloth frisbee around. We stopped for a
snack near Bastrop, and had supper at McDonalds in Austin.  I called
Christy Deans from there, well, I tried.  She wasn&rsquo;t there.  We
weren&rsquo;t too wild.  We got to Inks Lake at 7:30.  It was a perfect
night.  No clouds, No wind, nice temperature.  We unloaded and put our
stuff under a tree on a tarp where we were going to sleep.  We went
into a cabin a messed around. Mike Hurt and I were sitting with our
legs straight, then using our arms to press up into handstands.  We
all tried some stuff with a broom - put it behind your back, bring it
over your head, put one leg around your arm and back over the broom,
bring it back over your head and then step across with your other leg.
Wow!  We wold hold it and jump over it.  We did fingertip
pullups&hellip; just showin&rsquo; off.  We did that thing where you take three
foot length steps back from a wall, put your head against it, pick up
something then straighten up. keeping our legs straight.  I could do
it.  Only girls are supposed to be able to.  Beth went over to a tree
and started climbing.  Everyone followed.  We had like a line of
people climbing up and jumping off a branch.  Eventualy we all got
tired and everyone but a few people lay down under that tree. We
watched shooting stars, told stories, and jokes, we sang some.  I
played mercy with Mike Hurt.  We were perfectly matched.  We slept at
about 2:30am.</p>

<p>At 3:00 it started raining.  We all jumped up and went
to a cabin.  It started raining hard, then.  Wind was blowin&rsquo; it right
in the screen.  We were totally crammed against the wall under the
screen.  Barry then got up and got a tarp to put on the windows
outside.  The wind kept it smacked up there all nigth.  I slept O.K. -
woke up at about 8:00 &amp; took a shower (all the hot water was gone) I
froze!  The wind was still blowing making it worse.  My voice was a
little hoarse.  I went into the breakfast cabin, and helped cook.
Then we played frisbee, frisbee football, we tossed washers, we did
some double stunts - stand on someones shoulders -, played on some
see-saws, a slide, and swings.  I learned how to flip out of a swing.
Not from my back, but sitting.  The trick is to hold on to the chains
until you are rightside up.  Mike and Renae taught me how.  I did
double stunts with Pam.</p>

<p>We went on the canoe trip. I was with Mike
Hamm and Wade.  We jumped in and were cruisin&rsquo;.  Wade was humming the
theme from Hawaii 5-0.  The wind was blowin&rsquo; so hard that Pam, Beth,
Renae got dumped over. Wade and I helped them.  Then came some rapids.
Mr. Hamm told us to go through them a certain way so we wouldn&rsquo;t tip.
We said fine.  No problem.  Oh- before the rapids we had taken our
shirts off and tied them to the cross bars on the canoe.  So we went
through the first part of the rapids real easily.  Then we turned to
go down the next section, and the wind took the chance and blew us
sideways.  We took in about 6 inches of water at first, and we were
trying to keep cool (ha ha) and say no prob.  Then we had to hit a
wave and ended up about half full of water.  We were still saying&rsquo;
it&rsquo;s cool - we can do it.  Then one last time and we sank.  Wade
immediately jumped out a swam for shore.  The canoe turned over and
Mike crawled on top.  I was hanging on to the side, telling Mike it
was O.K. and trying to get used to the water.  Then I pulled our conoe
to a dock Wade had run to.  We got there, dumped it out, and were
freezin&rsquo;.  There was an old dude watching us.  It was his dock.  Then
we went across the river to where the Torgesens and Glen were.  We
tied up and waited for the others. I lay out on a rock gettin&rsquo; a tan
during that time.</p>

<p>After about another hour, everyone was there and we
played some games and told jokes.  I learned the 7 game then.  Later,
the camper got there and we chunked a football and 2 tennis balls
around.  We waited some more and then went back to camp.  Mike Hurt
and Mr. Hamm took the canoes back that afternoon.  We had supper in
Burnet.  We went to Dairy Queen to eat.  I bought a banana split and a
shake and a glass of water.  Nothing nutritious.  Then we went to buy
groceries.  I drove Mike Hurt around in a shopping cart.  We read
magazines, and messed around.  Mike juggled some things, like boxes of
raisins, or cans of peas.  We just had a good time.  I slept in the
crazy group.  Not the Ahlborns&rsquo; clan, but Glen, John, Brian, Dave,
Eric (not Shafer), and Tim.  We gambled and ate M&amp;M and crackerjacks.</p>

<p>We read Tim&rsquo;s National Enquirerer- all the STUPID things in it.  We
slept at about 12:00 and Brian and I woke at about 6:00 to get warm
showers.  It worked.  By this time, I had lost a shirt, a pair of
socks, shampoo, toothpaste, and my soap.  Oh well.  We went back to
the breakfast cabin.  Then we played in the field again - just messing
around until the Vanishing Texas River Cruise.  Each ticket was 10
bucks.  We all just layed out on the top deck and got some sleep.
Mike Hurt and I took everything off except shorts to get a tan.  We
saw some water falls, Spanish Daggers (that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s in our front
yard), some Spanish goats, and some double crested Camerons.  Glen
called them Double Breasted&hellip; whatever.</p>

<p>The narrator? of the cruise
came up a few times to compliment our good behavior.  The last time we
were singing the theme from Giligan&rsquo;s Island.  Then later in the
afternoon, we went rappeling.  That was scary!  Getting over the edge
was against all instincts.  I was the first to go after Mike Hurt
did. (He was a college councilor for the trip).  We went swimming.
The wind had slowed some so it wasn&rsquo;t too bad.</p>

<p>We had supper in
Burnet again.  this time at Mr. Gatti&rsquo;s.  We were getting a little
wild here, but not too bad.  I had one piece of Eric Shafer&rsquo;s Pizza,
and I bought some cinamon bread sticks.  I was the last to order
anything and Brian and I were the last people in there.  We were
talking to the girl working there.  She had blonde hair and looked
like that girl on &ldquo;Heart of the City.&rdquo;  She was really pretty.  then
we crusied back to the camp.</p>

<p>I was in the crazy group again.  We were
messin&rsquo; around outside.  We threw rocks at the Alhborns&rsquo; group&rsquo;s
cabin.  Glen pissed in a can of Dr. Pepper and threw it on the roof.
Then we played Gastapo until about 12:30.  I slept outside with Eric
Shafer, Gary Picou, Mike hurt, Mike Hamm, and me.  I woke up, showered
(warm) and went to the breakfast cabin.  I asked Mr. Cowan what day it
was, and he said &ldquo;Wednesday the 25th.&rdquo;  If he hadn&rsquo;t said &ldquo;25th&rdquo; I
would not have remembered my B-day.</p>

<p>That day we went to West Cave and
Enchanted rock.  West Cave was neat.  We went down into a canyon by a
river.  We followed a little creek upstream to a horseshoe shaped
waterfall.  You could walk under the horseshoe behind the waterfall.
On one side of the HorseShoe, the water had fallen for so long
(100,000 yrs.) that a curtain of rock was formed, creating a cave.  It
was truly awesome. Then we went to Enchanted Rock.  On the way we
stopped at another horseshoe shaped falls.  This one was bigger,
though, and much prettier.  The water was <em><b>crystal</b></em> blue.  So
beautiful!!!</p>

<p>We ate lunch there.  I sat with Renae, Pam, Beth, Allan,
and Wade.  Renae dropped her apple into the water twice.  I walked
aroud behind the waterfall, where Carl was.  Then we all went back and
finished our trip to Enchanted Rock.  Enchanted R. was great.  I did a
crack climb with Mr. Hamm, a friction climb with Mr. Cowan, and tried
Ben&rsquo;s Climb.  Mr. Hamms climb was easy when you figured out how to put
your feet and hands to brace right.  Mr. Cowan&rsquo;s was easy for me.  I
just kept clawing around for a grip with my hands.  Ben&rsquo;s Climb was
tough!  Only Beth and Mike Hurt could do it.  Barry couldn&rsquo;t ven.  I
tried hard though, and got some good scratches trying, but nope.  I
was unable to form a fist in a certain crack to pull myself up with,
and Mike was not there to show me another way.  But, it was a noble
effort.</p>

<p>We went to Dairy Queen that night for supper.  the girl
working there asked us for our name when we ordered to make it more
personal. I said Ted for my name.  I got a hamburger and water and a
blizzard with M&amp;M&rsquo;s in it.  Brian got cold fajitas.  That was funny.
Later I went up there with Dave and ordered a blizzard.  We went down
the whole list, rejecting each item that was offered to put in it.
Then I said, &ldquo;How &lsquo;bout French Fries?&rdquo;  the girl sorta grossed out
then said sure.  I decided not, although everyone said Goforit!  I
just got M&amp;Ms again.</p>

<p>We went to camp after that and slept, got up the
next morning, took showers, and left for Waco.  We at breakfast and
McD&rsquo;s.  We were fairly wild then.  I got about 12 straws.  We played
outside some and then continued on.  We got to Waco, stopped had lunch
and then went to the palentelogical dig site.  There were bones of 15
mammoths there.  They all died right together.  We were trying to
figure out how they may have died.  Flood, Smoke, hunters, Lightning.
The Alhborn&rsquo;s thought of lightning.  Actually I did too, but I didn&rsquo;t
say anything because no one would have believed me.  Lightning
happened to be the guys&rsquo; favorite theory too.  Then he took us to a
big pit where there were a whole bunch of fossils.  Including shells,
shark teeth, starfish parts, and other things. I found a ski rope for
cave men, a broken Egyption compact disk, a skeleton of a Hobbit (I
didn&rsquo;t touch it because it was a grave), solid gold coins (too heavy
to carry), a complete shark skeleton (it was buried so I couldn&rsquo;t dig
it up), and a pteredactyl (it flew away).  So I didn&rsquo;t come back with
much to show for my finds.  Oh Yeah- a piece of the Rosetta Stone (it
fell out of a hole in my pocket) Oh, well.</p>

<p>We went to Mother Neff
that evening.  We played the ABC game along the way.  I helped cook
ribs with Mike Hurt that night.  I slept with the Alhborns&rsquo; group
again that night. I learned how to play murder and I got to talk to
Beth some and got to know her which was nice.  We heard some noises
that sounded like thunder.  It turned out to be a nearby military base
going through a simulation.  &ldquo;Playing Gastapo&rdquo; as I put it.  We got to
sleep-in the next morning.  We were going home that day, and we didn&rsquo;t
have to hurry.  There was plenty of hot water for showers.  There were
only 2 showers though.  Barry and I were in the shower part of the
bathroom at the same time.  We sang Lean On Me, and the national
anthem.  Wade and the Torgesens were bangin&rsquo; on the door to tell us to
hurry.</p>

<p>After that we ate breakfast and played washers.  I took some
pictures, and played frisbee.  John, Glen and I got a frisbee triangle
going.  Then we left.  We played the ABC game.  Only Me Glen John and
Tim made it all the way through.  Our list was, Australo-Burilicus,
Beer, Carmeron, Deoxyribonucleic acid, Elephantitis, Financial
advisor, Ganglion, Hypogryph, Intestinal gas flareup, Jumping Jack,
Kilomanjaro, Lopsa-apa, Mucus membranes, Nasal passages, Orthodontist,
Pathalogical Rapist, Quackological speech therapist, Reggae,
Supercalifragilisticexpialidoches, Thermo-molecular cumulo-rhumbic
with a linear postulation in section four on the left hand side,
Urinary passage, Vortices, Winnie the Pooh, Xenophobic nightmares,
Yugoslavian barbaric eras of time, and Zambia.  Pretty awesome, huh?</p>

<p>We went crazy at McD&rsquo;s.  We all ordered from one register, about
$70. I got a Big Mac, a hamburger, ice water, ice cream cone, apple
pie, and a medium Dr. Pepper.  Then I went back for a shake and
another pie.  I made off with about 25 straws from there.  Then it was
sleep for me until I got home.  I got everything back except
toothpaste, which I had left at home.  Dave got Mike Hurt&rsquo;s address.
Mike said we should plan a trip to Enchanted Rock.  He said he and a
friend could take about 8 of us.  I hope I can go.  Tim&rsquo;s mom took me
and Dave home, and that&rsquo;s it.  It was fun. We got home Friday- of
course.  I told Fred some of my jokes.  I think I&rsquo;m going to reserve
some pages in here for jokes and stories.  They may be the first pages
listed in my table of contents.</p>
