<a href="https://soness.com/">Soness</a>&rsquo;s
<a href="https://courses.yourspeakingjourney.com/">Get Booked to Speak in a Week</a>
class starting tomorrow.  So that means between tomorrow and the week
after, I should get booked to speak.  Does it count if I get booked
today, before the class starts?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not really a <em>speaking</em> engagement, but come on out to Bar
GariGari on June 1st for <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Apocrypha/events/249933126/">story telling night</a></p>

<pre><code>Hey Nathan

I am making a marble track, a.k.a. rolling ball track, similar to this
one I made several years ago, visible here https://mt2.robnugen.com/

This time, however, I am not just making the track, I am also making a
stop action animation of some characters making the track.  Clips of
the video so far are here https://mt3s.robnugen.com in a playlist.
(No audio nor background yet; that is a whole other project (I asked
you about Blender before))

The project is about 5% finished, and has taken a year to get this
far.  I don't have many followers yet, but I would like to have a
domain dedicated to the site while I build and document the whole
thing.

So basically, I want to make a site for the content visible here
https://mt3.robnugen.com/, but with branding specific to Marble Track
3, not Thunder Rabbit.

I think I &quot;just&quot; need a Hugo theme; I am using Hugo (static site
generator) to make the current site, including blog, photos, and
embedded Youtube videos.  I write pages in markdown format, using YAML
format for the frontmatter(1) (meta data: title, date, tags)

From this example source file
https://bitbucket.org/thunderrabbit/robnugen-journal-entries/raw/master/2018/05/02mt3-retested-large-marble.md

Hugo creates
https://new.robnugen.com/journal/2018/05/02/mt3-retested-large-marble/

I want to keep using that markdown + YAML format so I do not have to
disrupt my current workflow too much.

Here is my current theme https://github.com/thunderrabbit/purehugo-tr

How do we go about pricing such a thing?  I would be happy to include
a link to your site as designer.

   See you soon!
   - Rob

<p>I am in the middle of making the marble splitter work for small
marbles.</p>

<p>The manager has just glued one rail into place and will glue the inner
rail next.</p>

<p>Next, the manager will:</p>

<ul>
<li>glue inner rail for small track</li>
<li>test the too small marble (which will fail)</li>
<li>eject too small marble</li>
<li>test a correctly-sized small marble</li>
</ul>

<p>At the same time, Reversable Guy (RG) will place the other splitter
top rail.  Only problem is holding it in place before there are
supports for it.</p>

<p>Reversable Guy will:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lift the rail</li>
<li>Get help from Pinky</li>
<li>Call in some brown worms to act as supports</li>
<li>Have Green Cutter(*) cut support
pieces to size and glue them in place.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pinky will:</p>

<ul>
<li>help RG with the rail</li>
<li>install some kind of berm for the large marble</li>
</ul>

<p>Square head guy will:</p>

<ul>
<li>come back with the large marble</li>
<li>help Pinky with the berm OR/and</li>
<li>push the large marble up the ramp</li>
</ul>

<p>(*) He is Green Cutter for no reason other than he is completely
green, and he is the cutter.  There are no other cutters (yet) on the
set</p>

<p>Other things to be done:</p>

<ul>
<li>add berm to catch small marbles (near same place as the berm Pink
will add)</li>
<li>add curved rail which will guide medium sized marble off the
small/medium splitter</li>
<li>add small marble track extending clockwise from top of the three-way splitter</li>
<li>using curvable bamboo skewers, add medium+large marble track extending the other way from top of the
three-way splitter</li>
<li>carefully measure the circumfrence of the stage and calculate the
slope of the outer upper curved track so it will be <em>just</em> the right
height when it loops all the way around.</li>
<li>low-key add some ramps within the inside track which will double as
holders for this outer track.</li>
</ul>

<p>After writing the above, I think I should create a removable ring
track to be a stand-in for the actual track.  That way the inner track
will know exactly how high/low it needs to be a different places.</p>

<p>And <em>now</em> I think I am about ready to get a domain specifically for
this project.  Not sure how to have Hugo grab exactly one set of tags
to make entries though.  Is it too much trouble to maintain two
different sets of entries?  Can I do hardlinks in OS X?</p>

<p>(written 10:21 Wednesday 09 May 2018 JST)</p>

<p>I spent a bit over an hour on MT3 yesterday. At least half of that
time was spent thinking about what each character should do next.</p>

<p>I did not finish all my Complice stuff; I think I have overloaded it
with too many tasks each day.</p>

<p>Great Tokyo men&rsquo;s circle last night, despite the rain.  The new man
from last week attended again and had great insights on the problem I
presented to the circle.</p>

<p>I read several pages of Planet on Purpose, which inspired me to be a
more transparent leader in the circle, specifically, admitting when I
wasn&rsquo;t able to complete a task I had set for myself.</p>

<p>So thankful for my group tonight who were able to help me look at my
income problem, pick me up out of the proverbial quicksand, and open
me up to no limits for my business plan.</p>

<p>Not that I actually knew I was in proverbial quicksand, nor that I had
unconsciously put limits on my possible business.  Great to have great
feedback from them.</p>

<p>今朝４時ごろ長く見ていた夢が終わった。 This morning I had a long dream which finished at 4am.</p>

<p>今朝長く夢を見て４時ごろ起きた。 This morning I woke up from a long dream at 4am.</p>

<p class="dream">At an amusement park, Fred, Lin, and I were on a circular ride made
of red metal bars connected in a flexible way and with each joint
covered with leather.  I intended to ride leaning way back like this,
but when the ride started, there was really not enough room to lean
back.  I was actually leaning forward to keep from hitting the walls
outside the ride.  I felt spooked by the walls being so close to the ride itself.  The seats kept spiraling in and out of each other and I said HI,
or "excuse me" to greet each person my seat came near.  One guy on some
of the inner parts was down on the ground with fake money and we
started rolling through a lot of memes together like making puns,
wearing sunglasses, then screaming yeahhh, or get over it, or you the
real mvp, etc.  Then my seat went impossibly outside a column, which freaked me out and everyone started laughing when I started hollering, and
then my seat went outside into the larger park where Lin was there walking around
as she had already noped off the ride. I learned how to drive it
around the park so we rode together for a bit. until I woke up.</p>

<p>遊園地で弟と妻と円形の乗り物に乗った。　At an amusement park, my little brother, wife, and I were on a circular ride.</p>

<p>乗り物の部屋が小さすぎて怖かった。  The room was too small for the ride so it was scary.</p>

<p>右往左往っぽく回り回って他の人と挨拶した。　As we spun around, I greeted other riders.</p>

<p>妻が近に降りて部屋の外で会った。　My wife got off first, and I saw her outside the rooom.</p>

<p>Egad I got my credit card bill (yay I have a credit card) and holy
shipes I should have been a bit more careful.  Gotta sort out $450 by
the tenth.  I would think I should have this shit figured out by now.</p>

<p>In other news, Lin and I walked into one of the unfinished homes near
our house.  Did not stay too long and did not go to the second floor
because there were no stairs installed yet.</p>

<p>Oh, and I went to SOGO this morning.  Raisu was back, now living in
Japan so will attend more often.  Kay had to bounce early and Thanuja
was not there at all, but Oliver came!  Yay!  Had not seen him in over
a year.</p>

<p>Oh, and I spent a good bit of time working on ConSwi.</p>
