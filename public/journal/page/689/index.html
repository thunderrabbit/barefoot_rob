<p class=date>2:50 AM Sunday Aug 23 1992.</p>

<p>Molly & I still have not gotten a proper amount of sleep.  Jeanine
just called and I half asleep / half jokingly invited her over.  She
accepted.  It will be nice to hug her, but I don't want to be awake.
I imagine we'll go to House of Pies.</p>

<p>11:30PM called Laura.</p>

<p class=date>11:59:45 PM</p>

<p>Jeanine got here today at 4:20AM.  She talked & talked as we all 3
lay in bed.  I cuddled with Jeanine and gave her kisses on her back
and neck and ear.  We didn't do anything thought.  I slept util about
9AM & called Castle of Dreams.  Then my hard drive on my computer fully
died.  Dead.  Shit... It had been dying, and I have it all backed up,
but it still sucks.  At noon, I woke Jeanine up and she went "home" to
the Towers, where she is currently staying with Imelda, her old suite
mate, since she didn't get a room in the Quad.</p>

<p>Molly and I went to the Galleria and got a book bag for me.  Then
we picked up Jeanine & then went to Marcel's and picked up Marcel and
we met Maggie, John, Danielle, and Charlie and saw Far and Away.  It
was a cool movie.  (At the end of the night, I hugged Maggie and
whispered in her ear a line from the movie, "Her tits are too big for
her to be going to church.")  After that, Molly took Jeanine home, and
the rest of us waited at Sound Warehouse.  Marcel, Charlie and I
played "Shopping-Cart-Warrior Frisbee," where one dude throws the
frisbee and the other 2 run like crazy and catch it in the carts.
Very fun.  Then we went to Marco's and at Mexican food.  Now we are
home.  I just called Laura and she totally misses me.  I think of her
only in passing...</p>

<p><p class=date>1:35AM, Saturday, August 22, 1992</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Today&rdquo; I got to Good Morning America a tad early (2 minutes) and
took a picture of Alex beside Wayne &amp; Garth in Wayne&rsquo;s World.  he
watched the movie every night this week.  When I came in, there was a
big big group of peple in the hotel lobby who had been awake all
night.  At 4AM, a lady came up to me and said, &ldquo;So, is tomorrow your
last day?&rdquo;  I thought for a second and then said, &ldquo;No. <em>Today</em>
is our last day.&rdquo;</p>

<pre>
That could be interesting
</pre>

<p><p>She looked at her watch, and a little of realization hit her.</p>

<p><p class=date>7:55AM same day.</p>

<p><p>First, a note about the previous entry.  I was totally falling
asleep as I wrote the last 3 lines.  The text in blue was totally out
of a dream I was having.  I just wrote it down, knowing that it might
not make sense, but it would be a hardcopy of an otherwise elusive
dream thought.  The last line kinda makes sense; the worde are right,
but it&rsquo;s missing something.</p>

<p><p>Now, here&rsquo;s omething that&rsquo;s more like what I would have written if
I had been awake, starting with that which is in blue.</p>

<p><p>She looked at her watch, and looked a bit surprise as she realized
what I meant.  I said, &ldquo;go get some sleep.&rdquo;  she said, &ldquo;OK..&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>While we were at the &ldquo;Home Base,&rdquo; and I was keeping pedestrian
traffic moving (&ldquo;Just don&rsquo;t stop in the area, sir. Walk all the way
through.&ldquo;) a very nice looking girl approached me and asked about the
show and stuff.  I talked with her and then she left, and sat on a
chair to watch.  A bit later, we got a 15 minute break, and I sat and
talked to her.  Her name is Kelly and she&rsquo;s a computer programmer!
RIGHT!!! She lives in Phoenix, but I swapped addresses with her on her
business cards.  I said &ldquo;Hey&rdquo; to her several times after that as I was
running around during the show.</p>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s now 8:12AM.  I&rsquo;m going to Tomball to help ma pack.</p>

<p><p class=date>3:30PM Saturday August 22, 1992</p>

<p><p>Yesterday I got to sit in the seat that Dan Quayle was going to use
for the interview.  I acted as the lighting/camera guinea pig as the
lighting &amp; camera crews set up stuff around me.  Doug sat in Charlie&rsquo;s
chair, &ldquo;So, Mr Quayle, what do you think your chances for reelection
are?&rdquo;  &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be OK if I can just remember to spell &ldquo;vote&rdquo;
without an &ldquo;e&rdquo; on the end.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Doug covered his eyes and lowered his head as he laughed&hellip; It was
quite funny.  The Secret Service dudes swarmed over the whole hotel.
I would sya, &ldquo;Good Morning!&rdquo; to each of them, and they would just
grunt.  Except for one, who commented on the Good Morning America
T-shirt I was wearing.  I said, &ldquo;OK Ok.. I&rsquo;ll give you the shirt for
that little pin on your jacket.&rdquo;  He expelled a nervous choke of
laughter. &ldquo;Oh jeez. I might as well give you my first born.&rdquo;  Dude.</p>

<p><p>At the ending scene, Charlie was right by our &ldquo;office&rdquo;.  He said,
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be right back.&rdquo; and Patty the stage manager said, in her New
Jersey accent, &ldquo;Okay! Ten minute break!&rdquo; Charlie went in the room and
tossed the nerf football a little.  I was on the other side of the
table (Diagnoally opposite) and I said, &ldquo;hey, you wanna play?&rdquo; So he
tossed it to me and we played catch for 2 or 3 minutes RIGHT!!! I have
never enjoyed throwing a football per se, but since it was Charlie, I
loved it.  It was totally cool.  And he was commenting on throws. &ldquo;Oh
that was a good one&rdquo; &ldquo; This football is hard to spiral&rdquo; etc.  I loved
it.</p>

<p><p>Then Patty announced &ldquo;Okay we&rsquo;re back in 2 mintues!&rdquo;  So he went
out there and I <em>ran</em> to the other side of the htoel so I would
be in the background.  I stood there for the duration of the show.
Cool.</p>

<p><p>Afterward, Fred (runner) and I went to the 30th floor and took
pictures.  We snuck into a room that had a door ajar and took a
picture from the window.  The room was bigger than my whole apartment.</p>

<p class=date>11:55PM Saturday, 20 August 92

<p>Last night after work, Molly got here and we hugged and made out
for over an hour (NOT!)  We played on my computer and she got 9022 on
Blockout.  My lowest highscore is 90220 or so... We contacted John &
Maggie at Marcel's and met them at House of Pies on Antoine.  Molly
and I were given slightly inaccurate directions, so we took the scenic
route..  We got there and I hugged & hugged Maggie.  We went inside
and sat down.  Amy, our waitress, approached and we were goofing
around.  She asked if we were ready to order, so I said yes, and
telepathically told Marcel what I wanted, and he verbally told her.
Then I verbally told her what he telepathically ordered through me.
Make sense?  She came back a bit later and announced that Marcel and I
must be on the wrong wavelength, since my order, banana cream pie with
strawberry topping, doesn't exist.  I told her she has to special make
it for me.  She did.  When whe brought it out, I said, "wonderful.
Better than I had expected."</p>

<p>We ate, and Marcel told us the
dog-in-a-former-life-broken-clavical-joke and got Maggie with it.
Very funny.  Then we went home, and I accidentally dropped my frisbee
as I held it out the window.  Molly stopped and I got it, only after 2
cars had run it over, though.</p>

<p>Today, Molly and I went to Tomball and helped ma load the truck for
Dallas. We stopped by my dad's and got some software and a C++ book.
We got back home and then met Maggie & John at Marcel's.  We all
played Frisbee, incuding Molly's YoYoBee.  Then we watched Casablanca,
(Humphrey Bogart & Ingrid Bergman) Maggie & John left, and Marcel,
Molly & I watched Wayne's World.  Coolness.  Then we returned the
movies at Soundwarehouse, and I bought CD's <em>Pink Mischief</em> by
Jeannette Katt ("Girl Noise") and <em>The White Room</em> by The KLF
("3 A.M. Eternal" and "Last Train to Trancentral") This CD turns out
to be a double CD case and has mixes of "Justified & Ancient" on the
other CD.  Amazing.  Now we're listening to track 3 of <em>Pink
Mischief</em>, "Can I Call You Daddy?"  Good Night</p>

<p><p class=date>13:25 Thurs 20 Aug 92</p>

<p><p>Yesterday before the show, John and I got some elephant mylar
balloons out of the UPS room and decorated the set with them.  In the
process, 3 of them got loose and required 2 or 3 full minutes to float
to the ceiling.  Amazing.  After the show, Charlie was in a pretty
good mood.  I talked to him a bit - joking about how he was going to
do the bunjee jump from the 30th floor.  Pretty funny.  I talked to
TRQ (The Right Question), a pro Bush rapper, whose real name is Steve
something.  Doug and I taked to him after the show about getting him a
T-shirt.  At 11AM yesterday, I walked to the Lancaster Hotel and
picked up some guy&rsquo;s Ford Taurus because they needed it at the
Astrodome to get in.  (The car had a sticker on it that would let them
in.) I got to the Lancaster, and the valet dude opened the car door
for me (It was double parked in front of the hotel) He wished me a
safe trip and I drove to the Sheritan hotel near the Astrodome.  They
took the car and drove to the Astrodome, and left me in a new white
Lincoln Towncar.  Here&rsquo;s a quote from my day planner:</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in the reserve parking spot since Lynn gave Jose&rsquo; the valet
five bucks.  11:37AM I&rsquo;m listening to &ldquo;summertime&rdquo; by DJ Jazzy Jeff
and the Fresh Prince.  This stereo is nice.  Nice speakers with great
bass.</p>

<p><p>Shit the sideview mirror says &ldquo;Heated&rdquo; on it.  Now I&rsquo;m listening to
&ldquo;Sweet Dreams (are made of these)&rdquo;  The stero has a button on it that
says, &ldquo;audio&rdquo; It cycles the display through the following:
frequency/volume, Bass, Treble, Balance, Fade.  And the Volume button
(-  +) switches them accordingly.  Cool.</p>

<p><p>The airconditioner is on, and the engine is on.  They&rsquo;re so quiet
that I can&rsquo;t hear either.  I&rsquo;m going to sleep.  12:20PM Woke up.  Now
they have me driving the Taurus again.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>OK.  Back to real time now.  So they went to the Astrodome, while I
simply slept for 30 minutes. RIGHT!!!</p>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s now 16:58:15 Thursday 20 August 1992.  Molly just called from
Missouri.  They&rsquo;re on their way home!  Yay!!</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>Alex was watching Wayne&rsquo;s World again today. 20 Aug 92</p>

<p><p>Today at GMA, everyone was tired.  I took pictures of the whole
place and all the people.  I grabbed some of the pictures that John
took yesterday, including one of me zonked out hard.  I totally
totally need a foot and back massage.  I wish Laura were here.  Maybe
Molly will do it.  I slept for a couple hours todya, and then I did my
budget and wrote a birthday card for Cheri.  Now I&rsquo;m going to get a 2
inch binder from Bizmart to hold my computer manuals.</p>

<p><p class=date>3:15PM 18 Aug 92 Tuesday.</p>

<p><p>I just woke up from a 2 hour nap.  Yesterday I woke up at 2AM
easily since I had been sleeping, or resting pretty darn well since
6PM the previous day.  I got to the Hyatt Regency on time and went to
Arboritum 1, which is where Good Morning America (GMA) is set up.  I
met Alex, who was watching the end of Wayne&rsquo;s World as I came in.
He&rsquo;s also the guy for whom I was hired to work.  I met him, and I met
the incredible copy machine, a technological wonder.  It has 20 bins
into which it can make the copies, &amp; staple them and return the pile
of papers into the same pile.  Amazing.  It&rsquo;s not slow either.</p>

<p><p>I met John Barton, the crazy &ldquo;tacky&rdquo; guy who weras Hawaiian shirts
all the time.  I helped John put up posters and signs and tacky
decorations.  We used tacky gum and tacky tape and made all our stuff
look as tacky as possible.  We punned together and kept ol&rsquo; Pete, the
engineering guy, hopping.  (Pete is pretty fun too.)  He helped us by
getting red and white cloth and other stuff.  We also bugged Julie,
the beautiful hotel director of customer service.  John and I put a
sign up outside on the street on the Whistler&rsquo;s Walk Cafe sign.  Ours
said</p>

<pre>
     *

Good Morning
  America
</pre>

<p><p>(White star and white lettering on blue background) with red &amp;
white cloth hanging down.  It was pretty windy, so we clamped the
thing down with C clamps.  (Before we took the sign down after the
show, John took my picture while I stood in front of it.)  He and I
made ourselves at home, moving plants, chairs &amp; tables, by putting up
tacky signs over a huge mirror, (we tackied the whole mirror with the
gum stuff (we&rsquo;d tell people it was grape bubble gum, &ldquo;here, you want
some?&ldquo;) and the sign still wouldn&rsquo;t stay, so we taped the whole
thing.  We&rsquo;re talking a nice mirror.  Big.  With a big elaborate
wooden frame, and we taped tape all over it, and the wall besides.)
We put up a big GMA sign up on the glass in front of the glass
elevators.  We had to climb over (on) a nice couch and move a plant
and climb all in some styrofoam shit, that didn&rsquo;t support much
pressure.  There was a Vietnamese guy name Chio, to whom John said,
&ldquo;You know what will get that [George Bush for President] sticker off
[the escalator]?  Lighter fluid.&rdquo;  Chio didn&rsquo;t respond at first so
John said, &ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t speak English.&rdquo;  Chio does speak English, so
he was kinda mad at John, but John&rsquo;s so darn funny that one can&rsquo;t be
mad at him too long.  So Chio started talking to us as well.</p>

<p><p>During the show, I stood at the doorway of the truck that was
parked on the sidewalk, broadcasting to New York.  I didn&rsquo;t do much,
but watch and learn.  Everyone in there wore headsets and could talk
to everyone else inside and outside the hotel.  Stuff like timing the
show and fixing microphones and placing cameras and lights.  Cool cool
stuff.  Charlie Gibson and local guests were audible via their
microphones through speakers in the ceiling of the truck.</p>

<p><p>After the show, I rode the elevators and flirted with Monica, who
showed me a message system (modem) on her notebook computer.  Then I
left at 1PM, as scheduled, <em>except</em> for the fact that I
accidentally left at 1PM New York time, an hour early here.  Oh well.</p>

<p><p>Work at the hospital sucked, since Emilio wasn&rsquo;t there, and the
computer fucked up and I was therefore there until 9:30PM.  Shit I was
tired.  I got in bed at 10PM and tossed and turned until 10:30PM.  I
slept until 2AM and got up for GMA today.</p>

<p><p>When I got in, Alex was watching Wayne&rsquo;s World again.  We chilled
until John got there, and I helped him put up signs and such.  I said,
&ldquo;Good morning, (name)&rdquo; to everyone whose name I knew all day.  Before
the broadcast, I flirted a bit with Audry (she pronounces it &ldquo;Awdree&rdquo;
in her English accent), Charlie&rsquo;s make up artist.  I also flirted some
with Julie (of course) and Patti (sp) the stage manager.  I helped her
do camera shit and I got to be the model for a lot of the shots so
that the cameras could get placed properly.  Total cool.</p>

<p><p>During the broadcast, I got to act as a bouncer (politely) and keep
people from gawking while visible by the cameras.  I would tell them
&ldquo;walk all the way through the set, but do not stop.  Sir do not stand
on the set.  Walk through if you need to but do not stop.  etc etc&rdquo;
It was kind of difficult to predict which people would stop, and which
wouldn&rsquo;t.  If you thought they were going to stop, you tell them
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t stop.&rdquo; They stop and say &ldquo;what?&rdquo;  So you say &ldquo;go.&rdquo; And they say
&ldquo;I was&rdquo;  Aaaaaaaagghhh.</p>

<p><p>It was a very cool job though.  Pattie said I did wonderfully, and
I&rsquo;ll probably do that the rest of the time.  Cool.  Patti looks a lot
like Tammy&rsquo;s mom, who I also find attractive.  I would often just
imagine serious ear nibbling and total eargasming Patti.  Mmmm.  After
the broadcast, I talked to Doug, the technical direcotr.  (His name is
in the credits)  He explained a lot of the technical stuff and we got
along well.  We joked a lot, and I made a funny picture of George
Bush wearing the Astrodome as a hat inside a column of one of the
calendar of the week.  (That made a lot of sense.)  Anyway, he liked
it, and wants me to find a caption for it.  &ldquo;Make it funny, so
everyone will have a reason to wake up at 3AM.&rdquo;  So I may work on
that.  I added Doug to my list of people who will buy me lunch if I
get a 4.0 this semester.  RIGHT!!!</p>

<p><p>After the broadcast, the whole crew was going nuts coordinating an
interview with Barbara Bush.  I was asked to drive, but I couldn&rsquo;t,
since Dave was coming over today.</p>

<p><p>Before Dave came over, I slept for a couple hours, and then wrote
all this.  Sister Gemma in the pharmacy called and wanted me to come
in. &ldquo;No way,&rdquo; I said.  I also said No way can I come in early
tomorrow, and I won&rsquo;t come in Thursday, either.  Fuck her.</p>

<p><p>Dave came over and we played on the computer, blockout, Castle of
Dreams, etc.  We also played DOTS and I showed him my budget program
so far.  Then we went to Sears, and I bought 2 crescent wrenches and a
pair of pliers so that Dave could fix his transmission.</p>

<p><p>Then we went to Bizmart, so that I could get my binder that Mary
special ordered, and so I could flirt with her.  She wasn&rsquo;t there, so
we just goofed around on the IBM. I made about 5 nested directories
amed ROB, and Dave nested 5 DAVE directories in there, and then we did
PROMPT and made the prompt just C&gt; so that one can&rsquo;t tell what
directory it&rsquo;s in.  Then we did DIR C:\, so it looked like it was in
the root directory.  hilarious.  Until we finished and Dave looked
behind us and a Bizmart dude was standing there.  The Bizmart dude
kinda laughed when Dave laughed, and I lied, &ldquo;I was just showing him
what I learned yesterday.  We both have cool Macintosh&rsquo;s at home. &ldquo;
NOT.  So it ws pretty funny.  Then we went to Soundwaves, and I went
all the way through the used CD&rsquo;s, but didn&rsquo;t find anything.  Oh well.</p>

<p><p>Then we went home, and fixed Dave&rsquo;s clutch.  Then we talked a bit,
and I added Dave to my lunch for a 4.0 list and then we cruised home.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ve been up since 2AM.  I&rsquo;ll be up at 2AM.  GMA was great.  I&rsquo;ve
logged it in my day planner and I&rsquo;ll put in here later.  I can&rsquo;t see
the page since my contacts are out.  I didn&rsquo;t piss all day today &ndash; 20
hours.  The toilet water was beer colored afterward.</p>

<p><p class=date>Saturday 15 Aug 92 9:20 PM</p>

<p><p>This morning I woke up at 4AM and did laundry.  Damn! I can&rsquo;t
believe it was today.  At 10:30AM, I went to the Hyatt Regency to meet
Irma Norris about my Good Morning America job.  She&rsquo;s quite a nice
lady, and I believe all will work out great.  She showed Fred (not my
brother, another runner like me) and I where the cameras would be and
where the interviews would be, etc.  I also got a nifty ID thing that
will be cool looking in my scrapbook.</p>

<p><p>After that, I went to Kroger and bought posterboard to make a full
semester calendar, and I got my paycheck and flirted with Cheryl,
Carol, &amp; Dorschell.</p>

<p><p>Then I bought 2 rats for Mickey to eat.  He ate them both pretty
quickly.  Then I went to the hardware store and got 2 washers and a
bushing and I fixed my window handle knob on the van.  Then I went to
Pierre&rsquo;s and borrowed his OS/2 installation disks.  I backed up my
entire 3 logical hard drives onto my tape backup. Then I played with
windows for a while and now it&rsquo;s time for bed.  Belinda (volunteer
from the pharmacy) just called to say, &ldquo;HI&rdquo;  Later</p>

<p><p class=date>7:45PM Friday Aug 14 1992</p>

<p><p>I talked to Jami last night, and I enquired about her real name.
Maggie told me it was longer, but I didn&rsquo;t know how to spell it.  Now
I do.</p>

<p><p>When Irma the Good Morning America lady called, I noted she had a
thick Brooklyn accent. Cool.  She said, &ldquo;Tomorrow, between 10 and
10:30AM <em>Your</em> time, call the 1-800 number and dial extension
6484, and ask for Grace.  Ask Grace to give you my local number in
Houston. I&rsquo;ll be at the Lancaster Hotel.  Call that number and we&rsquo;ll
set up an appointment so that I can meet you and see what you look
like.&rdquo;  Before that, she had left a message on my answering machine,
&ldquo;call the 1-800 number and dial zero. Ask the operator to connect you
to my home phone number.&rdquo;  It&rsquo;s wild trying to contact Irma.  Busy
busy busy.. ..</p>

<p><p>A dude from the convention came in and got some antibitotics.  (He
was getting sick since he had been working 12 hour days for a week at
the convention.)  He didn&rsquo;t have enough cash to cover it, so I dropped
the price a few dollars.  I would have given it to him free, but I
didn&rsquo;t want to be too darn suspicious.  He gave me his business card
with his local phone number on there.  His name is Ronald Ruprecht,
Director of Network Services / Computer Services Department /
Strategic Information Division / Republican National Committee.  Dude.
He said, &ldquo;come by some time and I&rsquo;ll show you the system.&rdquo;  Total
coolness.</p>

<p><p>Fred and I are currently looking for &ldquo;Cheese Shop,&rdquo; a song by Monte
Python.  We called Cactus, and I talked to a fun sounding girl named
Carolyn.  I&rsquo;m going to meet her some time when I go over there.</p>

<p><p>I made a bet with Emilio that I will make a 4.0 GPA this coming
semester. I&rsquo;ve also made similar bets with several other people.  For
Emilio, he will buy me lunch if I make a 4.0.  I will buy him lunch if
I don&rsquo;t.  Fred wrote the following in my day planner -&gt; &ldquo;The element
of the set {Fred, Rob} with the highest GPA will have lunch provided
by the remaining elements in the set at a cost unanimously agreed upon
by all elements in the set at the time of the providing.&rdquo;  Next to
that, I have written &ldquo;List of People who will buy me lunch if I get a
4.0  Tammy, Maggie, Warner, Berling, Ma, Dad x 5&rdquo;  the 2 charachters
after &ldquo;Dad&rdquo; are read, &ldquo;times five,&rdquo; cause he said, &ldquo;shit I&rsquo;ll buy you
lunch 5 times if you get a 4.0&rdquo;  Cool.  I&rsquo;m about to call Heather to
see if she&rsquo;ll do it. (It was busy.)</p>
