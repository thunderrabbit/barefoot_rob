<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>In my old apartment on West Gray, I was listening to one of
the obnoxious night DJs on KRBE - Adam Smasher I think.  Except his
telephone helper girl was at my apartment chillin'.</p>

<p class=dream>I wanted to tell a story or some such over the air, so she
got me through to the DJ who was all, "blah blah what's your name?"</p>

<p class=dream>I told him and just started this tirade description of what
I've been up to lately as if people want to hear about that, and he was
surprisingly quiet, no inerrupting me as I was expecting him to do, even
when I got sidetracked by Christine and Daniel bounding into the room
un-announced, except that it wasn't Daniel, but Will from YRUU.</p>

<p class=dream>I was all, "say HI on the radio!" and they said HI and I
continued my story.  The end of the story had to do with finances or
something, because I made a reference to "Money Matters" and then was all,
"oh I can't say that MM word on this station; that's a radio show on a
different station."</p>

<p>something else and I woke up.</p>

<p>I'm at this dumb little site that I found cause it was featured on
www.nunames.nu: <a href="https://www.katy.nu">www.katy.nu</a> and it's got
two pages, a list of names of her friends, and a link to a joke page.</p>

<p>Some of the jokes are *funny*.</p>

<p>Today we changed our T1 provider at work.  This has been a long
time in preparation, partially because we have clients that have
"trusted" our IP address so their users can visit us without using an
extra password, and partially because we have a cluster of machines
behind a NAT-enabled firewall acting together as our web server,
instead of just one machine with no firewall.</p>

<p>Right now I'm telnetted to my site, and have configured my settings
in pine to be more like what I want - don't ask before expunging
messages, don't ask before quitting; that kind of thing.  Oh, and use
emacs as my default editor.</p>

<p>That last one is a bit silly because usually I use emacs as my
default mailer anyway, which necessarily uses emacs as my default
email editor.</p>

<p>But anyway, pine is configured better now and it's allll good.</p>

<p>I would have ridden my unicycle home, but the crankshaft decided to not
be attached to the wheel.  it's still inside the wheel, but it turns and the
wheel doesn't.</p>

<p>I just visited Ridg, a dad or something, step dad i think of John, friend
of Dude's.  Helped Ridg with computer stuff.  Win 98.  pretty simple.  He
seems like a nice guy and all; I may just pay him a visit for fun and
dialogue.</p>

<p>Going to meet Marta at TGI Friday's out on I-10 and the beltway.  She's
the Marta that I met at Plano Rally.  Her dad's friend is the recruiter for
English teachers to Japan.</p>

<p>She brought information for me on that.  Nice.</p>

<p class=date>11:40 pm</p>

<p>Kristen called during the evening and it turns out that she was in Katy,
so she came bby to say HI for a bit.  She and Marta exchanged a few stage
performance stories.</p>

<p>Kristen just left and I just found out that Marta and I have the same
birthday five years apart.  She's 9908 days old today and will be 10000 on
10 August 2002!</p>

<p>Also learned that our waiter Quincy is a hip hop artist.</p>

<p class=date>12:34 am Saturday 11 May 2002</p>

<p>Super thanks to Marta for a lovely meal.</p>

<p>Had a great time talking to Quincy, whose stage name is Fateye (two words
maybe).  He is an up and coming hip hop artists, just trying to make a few
benjamins in his life.</p>

<p>Going to my dad's now to drive to Tyler tomorrow.</p>

<p class=date>2:22 am Saturday</p>

<p>I'm at my dad's house now.  The kitchen looks significantly different.
I'm sad that they painted over the wood paneliing inside the kitchen.  When
we bought the house 15+ years ago, the wood paneling was a big reason why my
dad liked it.</p>

<p>I remember being proud of him defending his preference against our
loud-mouth neighbor who said, "there's too much <em>wood</em>"</p>

<p>Even so, great to joke around with Fred - all silly stories and
funniness.</p>

<p>Oh, and I get to see dad's sister Becky and their mom Cordie, and Becky's
granddaughter Sarah (sp) who looks <em>just</em> like her mom Barbie.  So
amazing.</p>

<p class=date>2:48 am</p>

<p>Wow.  I just read through the wedding ceremony plan, and note that I am
the Best Man for my dad.  I guess that's why he asked me to bring a
suit.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>Had just driven my car (it was my old Oldsmobile Omega) and
had a bit of trouble parking it because the steering wheel seemed to be
missing, and the brakes didn't work.</p>

<p class=dream>I looked all around, and the place where the steering column
should be had nothing but the gear shift of the automatic transmission and a
little tiny bit of the steering column, which I could use to steer the car
with some difficulty.</p>

<p class=dream>As I was backing into the space, I nearly hit the mail truck
behind me, but I yanked the emergency brake really hard, so it was way up by
the ceiling of the car, except that the car was now a convertible.</p>

<p class=dream>I got out, still looking for the steering wheel, noting that
it must be very close by because I had to have used it to drive the car this
far.</p>

<p class=dream>Suddenly, the roof of the car was back on top of the car,
even though I didn't remember converting it .  This was all very
strange.</p>

<p class=note>(and further strange is that I didn't recognize I must be
dreaming!)</p>

<p class=dream>I was now in someone's driveway, and they were looking for
inline skates or something, and I lifted the back part of the roof of my car
to look in the pile of junk back there to see if I had something they could
use.</p>

<p>I see this dream as the car represents my life now as I'm somewhat
releasing the steering wheel.  And the junk in the back is all my baggage
(stuff that I've collected so far this life) and I have the opportunity now
to release that stuff to people who will be interested in using it.
(Including my skates? ... Hmm; I'm not using them lately, but I still like
having them in case I wanna skate again)</p>

<p>I'm up early this morning after having slept yesterday afternoon.  I have
to be back at work in 2 hours for part two of the chat meeting with
Singapore.</p>

<p>It seems that I may be typing more on her speed as I've been using dvorak
layout at work.</p>

<p>I'm actually going to go in to work now and get some coding done
hopefully.  Working on a couple changes with the Email Sender - it is
blanking out a field after the emails are sent, and it's not working
correctly if there are no emails to be sent, but there is a report to be
generated.</p>

<p class=date>8:59am</p>

<p>For a couple hours I was able to maintain dvorak layout, but then we
started having communication breakdowns with two slow typists, and I
switched to qwerty to clear everything up.  I'll switch back soon.</p>

<p>I also handled a voice phone call at the same time as the chat.  It was a
bit of a challenge to handle both conversations at once.  Good stuff.</p>

<p>Just conversed with Emilio for 3 hours on the phone.  As usual, he asked
me a bunch of questions, probing my life and spiritual beliefs, which I
totally love.</p>

<p>To be clear, he got plenty of time to describe his current family
situation, and his current consideration that he may become a priest in the
Jesuit denomonation.</p>

<p>At one point during my long winded description of what I think is the
nature of this reality, I had a sense of being interviewed - and a wanting
that this was all being captured so I could be immortalized, er, I mean so
that more people could read/hear my thoughts and hopefully be helped by them
in some way.</p>

<p>Thank you, Emilio, for interviewing me.  It was a great pleasure.</p>

<p>I have just arrived home from work for the day.  I had gone in at
5:45am for a long distance meeting via chat (Yahoo! Messenger) with our
Singapore clients.  I can type way faster than them (using QWERTY
layout), so I was also able to write up some notes on what had happened
with our email last night.</p>

<p>Today it was determined that our hosts file was wiggidey wack since
its order was reversed.  It had name then IP address instead of IP
address then name.  That explains some of the confusion I had last
night.</p>

<p>After chat-meeting, I visited <a
href='https://www.thewealthsource.com'>Kim</a> at Empire Cafe' for my
coaching session.  Things are looking way up from when I started with
him several months ago.  It's really neat to watch the progress.</p>

<p>Then back to work where I was having trouble staying focused, and
recently fell flat asleep sitting up in my chair and was only roused
over the nin din in my headphones by Dave yelling 'ROB!' several times
because I had a phone call.</p>

<p>It was Marcel, calling to give me encouragement on dvorak layout for
typing.  He uses it now, and enjoys it a lot more than qwerty.</p>

<p>Given that I had fallen asleep, and logged 11 hours yesterday, and 4
today, and will be in early tomorrow, I went home and here I am.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>

<p>It has recently come to my attention that I cannot find the
electronic journal entries that I wrote during me-an-Bryn's European
adventure.  I remember several times taking copious notes on my Visor,
but now I don't see them anywhere.  Not in my Visor, not on my Yahoo!
account, not on robnugen.com.</p>

<p>Apparently I won't be able to easily recreate a play by play, hour
by hour description down to the last tiny detail of the adventure.
I'm not entirely bummed about this, but just a little bit.  This gives
me an opportunity to reflect back on the trip as opposed to just
piling stuff onto my site.</p>

<p>"All of the Kudos are gone," I said, referring to the chocolate rice
crispy bars that had appeared in the kitchen at work yesterday.</p>

<p>"I guess no one liked them," laughed Karla over the phone.</p>

<p>"Yeah, especially not me."</p>

<p>HI.  I'm still at work.  Our email connectivity has gone from bad
fine to bad to worse this day.  First we could not send emails.  Then
we could send emails.  Then we could not send emails.  Then I got
involved with it.  Now we can send emails, but we can't receive emails.
 I suggest this is worse because before we could at least tell when
people were trying to reach us, and we could call them back, or send an
email from a web based account.  Now we don't even know if they are
trying to contact us.</p>

<p>I've been in touch with Karla and Kevin; we're going to contact our
contacts and let them know the situation.</p>

<p>I'm actually on the phone right now; he's asking random questions,
probing around my brain to see if any answers dislodge.</p>

<p>None.</p>
