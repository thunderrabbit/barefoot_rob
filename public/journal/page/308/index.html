                        <p class=date>7:20pm JST Monday 24 November 2003</p>

<p>I understood my first verbal Japanese joke today!</p>

<p>I am "つなとも" with ひろ, one of なみ's tomodachis.  Wow I spelled
  tomodachi out without noticing that it's not English.</p>

<p>The performance was not exactly amazing at first; I was like "meh"
  but then it got better and better, with my favorite tapdance move
  being tatatatata back and forth on toe tips.  Sweet.</p>

<p>Okay, I've turned off my screen so I use less battery.   I'm on
  the train going home now.</p>

<p>So I was in line 45 minutes before the show, and actually 15
  minutes before the doors opened so I figured I could get some
  flowers for Nami, as suggested to me by Liz.  I wandered about the
  area and found myself at a park.  I wondered if I could just pick
  some flowers (not) but then on the way back along the same streets
  I had been previously, this time I saw a flowershop.  Nice.  And
  the flowers were only 1000 yen for a bundle.  The woman was just
  putting it together and I was like, Um cause I didn't want to have
  to order flowers and then have it go through some bureaucracy of
  flower making; I need them now..  but then bang she sold me the
  bundle she had just put together..  Sweet.</p>

<p>Um, so oh, so then I realized I hadn't put Nami's name on the
  flowers, so if I wasn't able to see her then I had no idea how I'd
  be able to get them to her.  But I suspected (correctly) that I'd be
  able to see her at least briefly after the show.  I found her in the
  crowd and gave her the flowers and she found her friends and
  introduced me (after they gave her flowers (yay) ). My 日本語 froze
  at first, but then I was able to get a little bit out.  Oh, and then
  Nami was like, "ひろは綱島ですんでます," and as Hiro was like,
  "where are you from," (in English) and at the same time I was like,
  私も and they were like, ほんと, すごい, and all that.  That's when
  Izu said "tsunatomo" which is shortened version of tsunashima
  tomodachis, or tsunashima friends.  I got it and laughed.  yay!</p>

<p>We got pictures and I assured Nami that I'm shy and then we left
  Nami and then they dropped me off at the train station and peace
  out; I'm alone again in Japan.  But I have a tsunatomo, who I may or
  may not ever see again.</p>

<p>The performance?  Well, it featured songs by Will Smith "Wild Wild
  West" and "Nod Ya Head" and there were some flamenco (?)  songs with
  castinets (sp) and some R & B songs, some jazz tunes, and a spoof of
  NHK programming, and it featured a cat named Chance Taylor, who's
  apparently famous in the US (on the tap scene) and he closed out the
  show with a solo, including him falling off the fucking stage as he
  was tapping backwards with his eyes closed, (I imagine, cause he had
  his eyes closed for a lot of the forward facing tappage as well) and
  I'm like, "damn G open ya eyes" and I was nervous that he'd fall off
  the stage again.  Anyway, he seemed fine and recovered as nicely as
  one can after falling off the stage backwards in tap shoes, (right
  at my feet, too; I was on the front row (open seating)) and well,
  yeah.</p>

<p>Um..  Nami appeared three times in the show, plus the finale with
  all the cast.  It wasn't like a play at all, the parts were almost
  completely disparate, with only a few segues.  From what I can tell,
  all the tappers had to buy their own outfits, as they were all just
  a bit different.  .  I wonder how much of a budget this show
  actually had; they did a lot with an apparently low budget.
  Specially seeing how I didn't pay for this ticket; I dunno how many
  free tix Nami got to give away.</p>

<p>The girls asked me if I have a girlfriend and I was like, def, in
  Texas.</p>

<p>Having limited success with my homework tonight.</p>

<p>Problem 1: I'm starting the night before it's due.</p>

<p>Problem 2: I don't remember what was assigned.</p>

<p>Problem 3: I'm tired.</p>

<p>Problem 4: I'm not being graded on this, so I probably won't do
  it.</p>

<p>Unproblem 1: I see the value of doing homework.</p>

<p>Unproblem 2: I see that if I do homework, I'll probably do better
  in class.</p>

<p>Unproblem 3: I see that I have made progress.</p>

<p>Problem 5: There's not many days left in this class's semester
  during which I can execute the brilliance of my plan: do homework
  sooner.</p>

<p>Only three lessons before lunch today, but then only TWO lessons
  after lunch.  Whoohoo!  I taught one student twice today.  Her name
  is くみこ, which I decided I could remember cause I had her
  >M&lt;.</p>

<p>I don't remember her face really, but she was wearing a red
  turtleneck sweater.</p>

<p>I figured out how to remember ゆたか's name; it ends with か like
  a question sentence.  So I can be like, "ゆたかですか" and it
  rhymes and I'll be right.</p>

<p>(wtf, right?  I guess I am learning this shit.)</p>

<p>Work was aight.  Many of my entries start that way.</p>

<p>Watched The Royal Tenenbaums upstairs at Rex, Lubo, and Tim's
  apartment with Dan (my (only (Matty moved out)) roommate).  Karen
  (Jennifer's sister) and Grace (Jennifer's roommate) showed up for
  part of it.  Tim wasn't there.</p>

<p>Not the great movie that I had heard it is.</p>

<p>I haven't heard back from Maggie on a slight crisis, but the good
  news is that I'm mostly over it.  But not 100%, I think.</p>

<p>Gotta go to bed.  I think part of my sour mood comes from me not
  being able to get a sub for tomorrow (on one day's notice) to allow
  me to see Nami's performance.  Sigh.  If I leave work *immediately*,
  I can travel for 1 hour to see the last 20 minutes of the
  performance.  Assuming I don't get lost.  After the show there will
  be no time for me to say HI to her.  That's my
  judgement/understanding. ..  I think if I had someone to go with or
  if I could go for the whole thing (2 hours) I would go.  Part of me
  wonders why I don't want to make the effort to see 20 minutes worth.
  I have all the assumptions about how lost I might get while feeling
  pressure to get there quickly..  just a nightmare for
  scheduling.</p>

<p>Ah, here's the rest of it: I've not seen Nami for some months
  (since we went to Fuji-Q Highland together) and I was really
  looking forward to seeing her.  And I felt embarassed for saying I
  can go when it turns out I can't.   BUT, no I never consciously
  knew the time of the performance.  I think the Japanese style of
  not doing anything to make other's lose face is part of my pattern
  here.  I'm not blaming Nami for not telling me what time the show
  is; I'm taking the blame myself for having assumed something and
  not having verified the information.</p>

<p>Okay; I'm going to bed.</p>

<p>Oh man.  I just met Nami to get the tix to her thingy on the 24th,
  and we were chowing noodles (makes it sound asian, but it was
  spaghetti) and then she's like blah blah blah and I'm like blah
  blah wtf?  And it starts at 5pm, but I don't get off work on Monday
  until 5:40pm!</p>

<p>Nightmare!</p>

<p>So I was like, all fracked up about that and stuff, but she was
  like, "'s cool, bro," but it really wasn't, so I texted Carla who
  can't work for me, but suggested Morag, and I called her, but it
  was busy and finally I was like, <em>okay, let it go</em> and
  continued noodle chowing.</p>

<p>Then soon as I was like, "aight bye" to Nami at 渋谷 station, I
  texted Morag and then called her and she called me back while I was
  chillin' on the train before we left the station (during the first
  paragraph above).  She said "no problem," she can work for me, and
  because of Nova's accounting rules (and I know how much I'm not
  impressed with their accounting (fuckin' hell, as I think about it
  I'm even *less* impressed, and will absolutely argue this point all
  the way up to Neil if they don't let us do the swap adross the
  month boundary) in that the scheduling and accounting
  databases/departments are completely separate) they will say we
  have to do the swap within the same month, which leaves only
  Wednesday as an option, which means I'd have to (*) work this
  Wednesday for her, and therefore reschedule going to Tokyo tower to
  hang out with Naomii.</p>

<p>(*) This is when Morag called me back to say she might *not* be
  able to work for me; she has a previous engagement that she doesn't
  know if she can switch or not.</p>

<p>(BUT (!) ), the good thing is that I'm not going crazy; Nami never
  emailed me that it starts at five.  We both *assumed* whatever we
  assumed about the timing (she assumed I have the day off (it's a
  National holiday), but we Nova teachers don't get shit off for
  holidays (except the days around New Years when the whole country
  shuts down) and I assumed it started later in the evening), but that
  is a different issue.</p>

<p>The cats beside me are talking about my computer I think.</p>

<p>work was aight.  I had only one class with two students, and one
class with 0 students, so I averaged out to 1 student per class.</p>

<p>The building next to us has a new gray tower crane thing that seems
quite sturdy and heavy.  We watched them use other cranes to put stuff
on top of that crane.  Big heavy orange crane parts.</p>

<p>Ah.  I see how this is formatting html.  The &lt;p> tags line are
being indented two spaces.  Fair enough.  I dunno if I like it or not,
though.  I wonder if I can switch it.</p>

<p>Um, oh the last two lessons were with Kiyomi and Morita,
respectively, so they were pretty fun.  I cracked the book with Kiyomi
only at the end, and with Morita not at all.  He said, "I can read the
book at home."  Wisdom from Physics 2.</p>

<p>This OS chews through battery power WAY faster than OS X 10.1.  Jon
was misinformed, or I misheard him or something.  Doeth.  Oh well.</p>

<p>Miffy (the little cat that I got from ふみ) has been lost.  She no
longer hangs daringly from my backpack.</p>

<p>le sigh.</p>
