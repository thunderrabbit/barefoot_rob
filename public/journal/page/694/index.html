<p><p class=date>Wednesday, June 3, 1992 11:13PM</p>

<p><p>Today I worked for (12) twelve hours at the hospital.  Dude.  We
were so busy yesterday.  We <em>almost</em> got caught up today.
(after staying 1.5 extra hours)</p>

<p><p>Lucy called this morning and thanked me for last night.  hmm- looks
like I told you that.</p>

<p><p>I intend to sell the jewelry and 3-D camera that I got from
Nishika.  The camera for $300, and the jewelry at the best price I can
get pawn shop.</p>

<p><p>I am really really ready to get my computer.  I should have a ton
of money amassed after getting $3000 from dad and working all these
hours and hopefully a lot from my &ldquo;2 Grand Prizes&rdquo; from Nishika.  If I
win 10 grand, I&rsquo;m going to get a monster 486DX Maximum speed, plus
coprocessor, Super Super VGA, 38,000 baud modem, modem dedicated phone
line with 64 or so megs on the mother borad and a bigger &amp; faster hard
drive plus tape backup - It will ROCK.  Right!</p>

<p><p>I woke up at 6AM and it was raining like crazy but I still drove to
KRBE and gave Psycho Robbie the cool feelings that I had written.  He
couldn&rsquo;t give me a tour, due to &ldquo;strict rules&rdquo; which I can
understand&hellip;  As I was driving out of the parking lot, Barsky said,
&ldquo;Robbie&rsquo;s got something here.  A listener came in the rain and brought
some cool feelings.  These are really funn.  (Darian Hunter laughing
and agreeing) Yeah we should hire this guy.&rdquo;  Robbie said he&rsquo;ll
broadcast them tomorrow as listener cool feelings.  Dude.  I was going
Right!  Alright!</p>

<p><p>I don&rsquo;t know if I ever told you about &ldquo;Right!&rdquo;  &ldquo;Right!&rdquo; will be
the new catch-all word.  The new phrase that sweeps across the country
if I have my way.  Use this word when something excellent happens.
Bark it out: <b>Right!</b> We just need a couple of rugby players from
Australia to market it.  They&rsquo;ll come on TV and whenever they like
something they&rsquo;ll shout &ldquo;Right!&rdquo;  Very cool.  Then Saturday Night Live
will pick up on it and <em>boom</em> across the country in no time.

<p><p>I talked to Psycho Robbie today and I&rsquo;m going to go to the radio
station tomorrow early and give him some cool feelings.  I worked 10
hours today.  Holy shit - dad called while I was at work and said he&rsquo;s

believe it&hellip; I got a note from UPS and Nishika Camera Company - my
stuff from the winning prize shit is here 3-D camera and jewelry.
Dude!  That is like most triumphantly excellent.  They were unable to
deliver it, so I&rsquo;ll try to call them tomorrow and pick it up maybe.

<p><p>After work I went to Fred&rsquo;s and we played with Char&rsquo;s video camera
and made some crazy home videos around the house.  I carried the
camera around and ran around and did the &ldquo;close call airplane&rdquo; bit and
stuff.  We loaded Fred&rsquo;s stuff and moved him over here.  He&rsquo;s got his
junk in the livingroom and I&rsquo;m going to bed now.  I&rsquo;ve got to wake up
early and go do laundry before a (probably) 10 hour day at St Joseph.
Later, and richer - Rob</p>

<p><p>Today Psycho Robbie had his wisdom teeth pulled out.  I called him
at the radio station and told him it (surgery) was no problem.  I also
told him a Cool Feeling: When you&rsquo;re at the dentist and the beautiful
nurse has her fingers in your mouth - that&rsquo;s a Cool Feeling.  He said,
&ldquo;how about when you&rsquo;re in the dentist&rsquo;s chair and you hear the drill
in the persons mouth in the room next to you - that&rsquo;s a cool feeling.&rdquo;
Dude I wrote him some more and mailed them today.</p>

<p><p>I may start a charter membership in the Penthouse Book and Video
Club, they send catalogs and I choose what I want to buy.  Cool.  That
will also put me on some sex mailing lists.</p>

<p><p>This whole week I worked 10 hours per day.  Ugh.  My head hurts
right now, too.  But my bank account will feel great.</p>

<p><p>Today I started my <em>WishCraft</em> exercise book.  I will get
what I want in life.  Sex, money &amp; computers.  Later</p>

<p><p>I just called Psycho Robbie, one of the DJ&rsquo;s at KRBE and I&rsquo;m going

<p><p>I worked 11 hours today at St Joseph.  At one point I was getting
really mad, but it was OK overall.  Tomorrow I have a follow up
appointment with Dr Bonefas.  Think I&rsquo;ll have enough guts to ask her
out to dinner?  We&rsquo;ll see.  Wouldn&rsquo;t that be cool?  I wrote to Monner
and Grandad today requesting a loan for my new computer.  I told them
(accurately) it would cost 1259.50 (386DX 40 Mhz &amp; 8megs memory,
Midsized tower case and 200watt power supply, SVGA monitor and card &amp;
Harddrive card &amp; I/O ports.)  I didn&rsquo;t ask for the whole amount, but
just whatever they could afford.  In return I&rsquo;ll pay $50 per month,
plus a nice long letter about my life at the time.  Cool beans.  Later</p>

<p><p class=date>Memorial Day Monday May 25, 1992 8:41 AM.</p>

<p><p>Last night I had a dream that</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was at the airport, and a skycrane helicopter
descended and picked up 4 people, each with a HUGE umbrella over
them.  These umbrellas must have been 10 or 12 feet in
<em>radius</em>. 20-24 feet diameter, (Duh).  Then there was a problem
and 2 umbrellas crashed and came tumbling, so I ran over there and
talked to the two girls that fell.  They were Ok, and I somehow knew
them (probably supposedly from Rallies, since I just talked to Karina
last night) So we talked for a big and I flirted with one and then we
planned to go swimming.</p>

<p><p>Then I woke up and had a huge hard on so I jacked off and imagined
Noelle coming over and me fucking her.  Now I&rsquo;m going to get busy:
laundry, recycling, and a few phone calls. (BBB about the company that
said I won 3-D camera and NCNB about my loan application)  Later</p>

<p><p>Today I recycled 58 pounds of lids from the pharmacy and 17 pounds
of aluminum cans.  I got $5.61 in exchange.  Dude.  Today I met Jodi
at The Container Store and we walked to the Galleria for a bit, where
I bought a book for Kiera entitled <em>What Makes You Thank Teksuns
Tawk Funny?</em> Then we went to my house and then to Marble Slab,
where I requested a double serving of ice cream: apple-n-spice flavor
and vanilla bean flavor plus 2 scoops of m&amp;m&rsquo;s &trade;.  That was great.
Then we went to see Lethal Weapon 3 at the huge Cineplex Odeon (sp)
down the street.  It was as good as the first 2, but not better, as
Lucy said.  Now I&rsquo;m here waiting for Tammy to come spend the night
because it might storm tonight.  She said no sex, though, so I jacked
off already. (Didn&rsquo;t get anything from Jodi.) That&rsquo;s it.  Later</p>

<p><p>Today I worked from 10 to 6PM.  Quina at work still won&rsquo;t give me
her phone number.  On a whim, I called Karina in Austin and talk to
her for the first time in 3 or 4 years.  We talked probably over an
hour.  She&rsquo;s moving to 3000 Beverly in about a week.  I&rsquo;m going to
have a big letter for her ready to go.  Later</p>
