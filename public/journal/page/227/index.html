<p>OS X Updater detected nothin&rsquo; because bah moe joe, and App Store was
unable to download XCode 6.1 because harumf harumf, but I was able to
download it from
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?name=Xcode#">https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?name=Xcode</a>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s downloading at 2.7777 MB per second according to a
URL-of-the-Google calculation.  But my connection pulls down at 4+ MB
per second from proper CDNs.</p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t Apple afford a proper CDN?</p>

<p>I went to the toy store today and they presented me with a puzzle they
had been unable to take apart.  It was like a &ldquo;secret box&rdquo; puzzle, but
was not hollow inside.  I set my timer for 30 minutes to make sure I
left in time for Mutsumi&rsquo;s lesson, then went to work.</p>

<p>I was able to solve it in about 25 minutes.</p>

<p>The guy saw that I had done it and came over to investigate; I showed
him how it went together.  While doing so, I dropped one of the pieces
and it came unglued!  D&rsquo;oh!!  That&rsquo;s gonna be hard to put back
together so precisely, but they (of course) said it was no problem.</p>

<p>I considered buying it (out of guilt) because I had planned to buy it
if I hadn&rsquo;t been able to solve it before having to go to the lesson..</p>

<p>But I didn&rsquo;t buy it, nor did I take a picture of it (for Fred: hey,
here&rsquo;s what I didn&rsquo;t buy for you).</p>

<div class="dream">
Fred and I were going opposite directions on the
train between Shibuya and Ebisu; I got on the train as he got off.  We
waved to each other, doing huge waves so we could see each other even
as the train was fully outside the station; I was running back and
forth along the seats as my wave so he could see the motion, and I
could see he was doing something equally wavy and we could see each
other all the way until I arrived at Shibuya station where I realized
I was walking in my underwear, but holding a briefcase through the
area and then walking toward the train station, some guys were like,
"woo woo look at this!" and I go, "sometimes I wear evn less!" and
flashed my butt at them as I walked down the stairs to the
station. The train was a shinkansen, arriving on the platform and then
correcting itself and going down on to the tracks, but somepeople had
to scramble a bit to get out of its way.  I walked past some group of
youth and they were like, "hey!" and said "and an ice cream for the
barefoot guy" and a girl with bright red coat pulled me toward the ice
cream stand with their group.

They were talking about church and I was like, "bah i'm not joining
any church" etc and as I began to rail on religion, I started to wake
up from the dream, </div>

<p>so I realized it was noisy brain activity that was waking me and I
shut that down and allowed myself back into dreamland</p>

<div class="dream"> I offered to go to church with them. and we were
in rows and they started a prayer in unison to "Doctor Oregon" (I
think) and I had my own prayer to him: "Doctor Oregon, I invite you to
show yourself and guide me in ever-loving and mutually beneficial ways
for the highest good" or something and I was talking to the group
again after that.

</div>

<p>but I don&rsquo;t really remember what we said.  I woke up soon thereafter.</p>

<p>I followed the instructions at
<a href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/roll-a-ball/">https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/roll-a-ball/</a>
and slapped together a little rolling ball game in Unity today.  I
wonder if I can embed it in hakyll.</p>

<p>Special thanks to past-self who was resting in bed and decided to set
up this buffer for writing my dream when future-self wakes up.</p>

<div class="dream">
During some kind of war, recieved a flying motorcycle which had been
gear to my DNA and was a gift from the past.  Our friend had driven a
car to kill two bad guys by crushing them into a wall, and we ran over
to take care of him because he was injured in the accident. A guy
asked fro two beers and I went over to the bar and he said it's the
price was 1500 so I gave him a 500 yen coin to start and he started to
give me 500 in change.  I was like, but I gave you.." and he thought I
was saying i gave him more than 2000 and I said, "no this is a 500 yen
coin from Japan" and he's like, "??" and I go, Um what year is this?
And he said it's "UN-11" and I explained I was born in 1970 and they
were like, "wth?" because no one knew how long ago that was.

I was able toremember that I had been in Japan until at least 2014,
but wasn't sure past that what happened.

He gave me a flying seat thing; it wasn't much more than just an
engine or maybe I had it and he just put in a new battery or
something, but the main point was they couldn't activate it.  It had
some kind of PGP key that was needed, and somewhere in my body was the
passphrase to unlock it.  I remotely communicated with my commander
that I was about to try the device, and it would either work or not; I
didn't know the password.  It worked immediately and I got on.

I remembered how to fly, but it was a bit unstable at first, but I
could achieve much higher speeds than by normal (dream) flying modes
with no external propulsion.

I flew over the local cluster of buildings and towaard the city,
hoping I wouldn't crash into the other myriad flying devices, because
I didn't know the local laws.  I flew up into some power lines (*) and
fortunately went through them instead of being injured.
</div>

<p>(*) high tension power lines used to often show up in my flying dreams; I hadn&rsquo;t seen them in a while until last night.</p>

<p>We ate at Gusto yesterday morning, where I got some mushroom + rice
soup.  Mark asked how it was and I go, &ldquo;It tastes like&hellip; mushroom
soup&rdquo; and Asuka added, &ldquo;with rice,&rdquo; which I really appreciated her dry
sense of humor. (is &ldquo;dry&rdquo; the right term?)</p>

<p>Sumiyaki left before the rest of us; he has to work on Sundays.</p>

<p>Mark, Asuka, and I walked back toward the contact site, and up a short
ridge that looked down on the area.  The trail was half-heartedly
blocked with a sign, though the trail itself was clear and relatively
heavily traveled.  We got to the top and could see most of the contact
site and had a nice view of Taito port where I took some pictures with
Mark&rsquo;s camera of the area.</p>

<p>Continued along the trail where we couldn&rsquo;t see the beach at all due
to dense bamboo on both side (not an old bamboo forest, but I think it
was young bamboo; I didn&rsquo;t take a good look), but noted how it was
quite dense and the trail was quite wide and clear!</p>

<p>We got to the end of he trail where it emptied onto a side road.
Turned left and saw a large sheetmetal wall blocking what I assume is
the driveway for an abandoned(?) property we could see from the beach.
I thought &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the way to block a trail if they really wanted to
block it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>We followed the road and veered left toward the beach when we had the
chance and walked along concrete slabs placed at slightly flat angles
on tetrapods,　テトラポド in Japanese, according to Asuka
(maybe ポード at the end).  Algae made some parts of them reallly
slick so we had to tread carefully, usually along the edges; I
wondered why the edges would dry first; most of the slabs were at
angles; it seemed there was no overall local minimum in the centers.
I slipped once but caught myself without much trouble.</p>

<p>The concrete slabs were missing from one section at which point Mark
decided to turn back.  I kept going, walking down onto the tetrapods,
but he asked that I don&rsquo;t.  I agreed because I wouldn&rsquo;t have been
there without him, and he had organized the group, etc.  Fair enough.</p>

<p>On the way back we continued walking along the coast instead of going
toward the street from which we had come.  I took an off-trail route
where the countless waves had smoothed the stone surface.  Asuka and I
admired nature&rsquo;s patient work as we tread carefully; some of the stone
was covered in a thin layer of ice!</p>

<p>Up on the hill there&rsquo;s an apparently abandoned home which is still
beautifully intact.  We walked around it, peering in to see furniture,
cutlery; even plates on the table, as if it were a model home.  Next
door was an empty lot where I had walked around (and fell into a
trough as it was all overgrown with bamboo and I couldn&rsquo;t see the
ground).  Leading up to the empty house and the empty lot were the
same style steps, so I assume the model house was meant to attract
buyers for the second house, which never got built due to lack of
buyers.</p>

<p>It would be a <em>great</em> house for an artist, with a great view of the
sea, and for parties, with a nice pool and jacuuzi, which featured
algae-covered bottoms, but completely clear water and no scum on top!</p>

<p>All the doors on the house were securely locked.  Gosh I would love to
live there.</p>

<p>Headed back after that.  We explored the area pretty carefully in
search of a light source we had seen the previous night.  Couldn&rsquo;t
find anything that seemed like it could have produced any light, much
less the brightness which we had seen.</p>

<p>We took a taxi to Taito station, and then Sotobu line to Chiba on
which I slept as Mark and Asuka talked; Sobu line to Akihabara on
which Asuka slept while Mark and I talked.  Said bye to Mark in
Akihabara where Asuka and I changed to Kehin Tohoku line and chatted
until I hopped off in Kawasaki.  She said she still had 30 minutes to
go.</p>

<p>Okay see ya next month!</p>

<p>On the train now headed to something-Ichinomiya station in Chiba.</p>

<p>Should arrive in Chiba station at 12:36 and then I&rsquo;ll hop onto another
train for 40 minutes or so.</p>

<p>##19:04 Saturday 17 January 2015</p>

<p>Great food at Boba cafe in Ishinomia.  Artist Hannah Sata had some
great pieces up in the loft.  Yeah, I can see how the guy last night
said mine look like amateur toys.</p>

<p>##02:25am Sunday 18 January 2015</p>

<p>Just now back at the crib.  I wore two pairs of socks, hiking boots,
underwear, long underwear, long jeans, sweat pants, rain pants,
t-shirt, blue jacket, YRUU hoodie, LRG hoodie, my rain jacket, big
overcoat, neck warmer, knit hat, and nice gloves.  Everything was warm
except the three middle toes on my right foot.</p>

<p>##03:07</p>

<p>Just took a shower with alternately cold, warm, scalding water; it
made me appreciate our consistently warm water at home!  Then ofuro
(bath) in a lonng wide tub, which could easily fit four people.</p>

<p>I basked in the water, letting my body float, with water periodically
covering my (closed) eyes as I breathed through my nose.</p>

<p>The bath had thin foam sheets floating on top of the water for
insulation.  I swam underneath them on my way out of the tub.</p>

<p>I forgot my toothbrush in the girl&rsquo;s room; we had used that room for
orientation and such, and due to some shuffling, Asuka is sleeping
there but we three guys are sleeping in the next room.  (Originally
she was going to sleep here.)  Anyway, my toothbrush is over there.
Moe joe fuzzy teeth.</p>

<pre><code>Hi Nugen,

I emailed you a few months back to discuss any outstanding
receivables you may have.

As I mentioned in my previous email we work with many Business’s
across the nation and we have developed a very strong approach for
your industry as a whole.  During our tenure of working with these
companies we have liquidated more than 50% (one as high as 70%) of
the dollars placed with us for some of our clients.  We would like
to show you the same successful results.

I wanted to follow up and see if there is anything we can help with. 

Again, there is no upfront cost to work with us, we’re only
compensated when we collect your past due receivables: NO
COLLECTION, NO FEE!

I can provide references if you like of other business we’ve
helped.  What our clients say about us is much more real than
anything I can come up with.

Would you be open to discussing in more detail sometime this week?

<p>But I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s smert to use Lastpass with it so I wonder if
I&rsquo;ll realistically use Tor for anything.</p>

<p>Gotta figure out a new way to keep passwords but moe joe what a pain.</p>
