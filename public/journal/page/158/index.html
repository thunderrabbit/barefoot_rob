<p>I&rsquo;m enjoying my recent lessons a lot more by being more focused on
having the students speak instead of correcting their errors.  I pick
out a few points perhaps, but basically allow them to chatter away as
long as I can essentially understand what they mean.</p>

<p>Today with GG, I did the same exercise as I did down in Fukuura: gave
instructions for drawing some lines, circles and dots.. The
instructions aren&rsquo;t perfect in that they won&rsquo;t result in identical
drawings in all correct interpretations, but they give some nice
listening practice as well as a chance to use &ldquo;horizontal&rdquo; and
&ldquo;vertical&rdquo; in a somewhat tangible way,.. and they allow me to string
together some prepositional phrases which may take some practice to
understand!</p>

<p>Specifically,</p>

<pre><code>... in the center of the right side
</code></pre>

<p>which M thought she might interpret in a couple of different ways.</p>

<p>On our way back, we talked about Lin and my trip to the US.  M asked
if I had finished packing.  I invited her to ask me if I had <em>started</em>
packing!</p>

<p>She asked how long the flight would last: &ldquo;negative 5 hours&rdquo; and we
talked about jet lag a bit, which led me to talk about consciousness
training at <a href="https://www.monroeinstitute.org">The Monroe Institute</a>,
which led to discussion of life between lives and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN16ubqbJUA">finding our purpose in life</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, good day!</p>

<p>A bit boring, but talking to Mark in the QA room, I was able to get
some insight on how to handle some aspects of the app we&rsquo;re making.</p>

<pre><code>NSURLsession
NSData  buffer , length
gfxCardStatus
</code></pre>

<p>He also gave a good idea for how to put all the junk for each mode of
our game in separate views!  It should make the modal idea completely
unnecessary.  Woohoo!  Thanks, Mark!</p>

<h2 id="11-35">11:35</h2>

<p>Buuuuut it&rsquo;s not working.</p>

<h2 id="next-session">next session</h2>

<p>AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate</p>

<p>AVPlayerItem
    navigation marker groups
    interstitial something something
    externalMetadata</p>

<p>AVAsset</p>

<h2 id="12-03">12:03</h2>

<p>interesting(?) command line tool</p>

<pre><code>mediastreamvalidator
</code></pre>

<h2 id="17-29">17:29</h2>

<p>The app is much better for having spoken with Mark and Stefan.
Instead of abusing the top bar with <code>Word List</code>, <code>Play Game</code> and <code>Play
Game</code>, it&rsquo;s now <code>Word List</code> and <code>Play Games</code>.  The Games tab brings up
a screen to select one or the other game.</p>

<p>Sweet.</p>

<p>I also met Guierrmo and saw Tom from iOS meetup.  Or he saw and
recognized me.</p>

<p>Tom and I walked back to Shinjuku station together.  He said he got a
lot out of the event, and he kinda helped me see a good side of Apple
and not just the poopy poop I keep complaining about.</p>

<p>Guierrmo gave me his card and said he can help or help me get in touch
with the right person!</p>

<pre><code>Ma!

We found a nice house in 新百合ケ丘 which is close enough to Tokyo
to work, and safe from tsunamis next time they come.

The house is near the bottom of a hill, but it's still high enough
to be safe hahaha.  It has a cute sunroom for Mama and double
windows for insulation everywhere else!

Super excited!

<p>It&rsquo;s actually not automated testing FTW yet; it&rsquo;s my choice to
carefully go through all the tests even though I am anxious to get the
changes to live server before I go on vacation FTW.</p>

<p>I have a list of tests that I was performing manually, and am now in
the process of performing them all manually just a couple more times
as I teach <a href="https://ghostinspector.com/">Ghost Inspector</a> how to do
them for me.  While teaching Mr Ghost how to do a test, the server
didn&rsquo;t pass the test!  I was like, &ldquo;awww crap!  Oh wait!  Wooo to the
Hooo!!!!&rdquo; because I hadn&rsquo;t moved broken code online.</p>

<p>Lin got a new suitcase!</p>

<p><a href="//b.robnugen.com/journal/2016/American_Tourister_case_2016-01-20_11.05.45.jpg"><img src="//b.robnugen.com/journal/2016/thumbs/American_Tourister_case_2016-01-20_11.05.45.jpg" alt="American Tourister case 2016-01-20 11.05.45" /></a>

<p>I rotated one number on the lock while pressing the combination reset,
and now I cannot unlock the lock.  Fuck fuck fuck.  Lin just bought
this suitcase <em>today</em> and asked if I can set the combination to
something other than 000.</p>

<p>Done.</p>

<h2 id="01-24">01:24</h2>

<p>I have rolled through all the combinations with 2 zeroes, and I&rsquo;ve
gone through the first 110 or so consecutive combinations.</p>

<p>I have tried making a <a href="https://github.com/Xyl2k/TSA-Travel-Sentry-master-keys/blob/master/TSA007_stubby.stl">key for the lock</a> by cutting up a credit card
sized card.  Not successful so far.</p>

<p>Is it better to take the bag to an authorized place and pay 5000 yen(?)
to have them unlock it or keep going through combinations?</p>

<h2 id="02-16">02:16</h2>

<p>Got it.  I went through every integer combination (to no avail) but
then tried 0½0 and got it.  Now it seems to be reset to 000.</p>

<p>Receipt for the lock is here <a href="https://goo.gl/HIhwMv">https://goo.gl/HIhwMv</a> or here</p>

<p>At the toy store today, Mai asked if I had solved the circular
quadruple maze thing.  I have not.  But I assured her if I received it
as a gift, I would be able to solve it.  (I have a plan for how to
solve it, but it involves (temporarily) placing marks (removable
stickers) on the surfaces of the mazes.)</p>

<p>She said she would give it to me for 65,000 yen.  I resisted saying
how about 65,000 kisses because (I probably wouldn&rsquo;t and) it would be
inappropriate.</p>

<p>But I go, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you throw old shit away?&rdquo; 古いものをすていますか？She
agreed and I asked what happened to the vertical ball game that had
been on the wall over there.  She said they still have it!</p>

<p>Long story short, they did <em>not</em> still had it; she and I were thinking
of other things.  The thing they still have is <em>better</em>.</p>

<p><a href="//b.robnugen.com/house/2016_all_electric_yurigaoka/2016-01-19_17.51.57_before_ownership_soon_to_be_new_toy.jpg"><img src="//b.robnugen.com/house/2016_all_electric_yurigaoka/thumbs/2016-01-19_17.51.57_before_ownership_soon_to_be_new_toy.jpg" alt="Rob and Mai with soon to be new toy" /></a></p>

<p>AND, they said they&rsquo;ll happily give it to me if I simply take it.</p>

<p>Sweet.  I know what will be the first decoration in our new house!!</p>

<p>I just noticed a gap in my recent journal entry dates.. I bet I was on
my computer all day Monday&hellip; oh but I remember I slept 12 hours (!!)
from 8pm to 8am after having a headache after (carrying my heavy bag
to and from) the ET Contact weekend at Pyramid Meditation Center near
Yanagawa station.</p>

<p>Being on my computer all day doesn&rsquo;t mean I <em>worked</em> all day, but
probably included watching an episode of Family Guy, which I remember
having done recently.</p>

<p>My goal for this train ride is to create a macro that will insert a
new timestamp if I keypress C-c 3.  I was going to do C-c #; maybe
I&rsquo;ll do both.</p>

<h2 id="12-14">12:14</h2>

<p>failed.  I thought this</p>

<pre><code>(defun markdown-timestamp-full ()
  &quot;Insert timestamp in markdown format.  NOT&quot;
  (insert
     (format-time-string &quot;## %H:%M %A %d %B %Y %Z&quot;)
     )
  )
</code></pre>

<p>plus this</p>

<pre><code>(global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-c #&quot;) 'markdown-timestamp-full)
</code></pre>

<p>Would do it, but I get <code>Wrong type argument: commandp, markdown-timestamp-full</code></p>

<p>Esther and I went to the river near the meditation center for a 20
minute meditation.  I stared across the river at a rock on the other
side.</p>

<p>Noticed how the stream was literally the archetype of the imagery for
&ldquo;stream of thoughts&rdquo; as the water flows by.</p>
