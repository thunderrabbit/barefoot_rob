<p>As I drove from Kinko's to Sally's NIN "closer" was on 94.9, the
radio station I found in San Diego.  When I called her number, I could
hear her actual phone ringing; her apartment is visible from the front
of the building.  Either that, or in an incredible irony, someone
else's phone rang exactly the same times as the speaker's phone rang
on the keypad on multiple times that I dialed.  I'm getting closer to
saying HI to Sally...</p>

<p class=date>4:36pm</p>

<p>Made it!  They were out riding bikes for an hour and had just
arrived back when I tried calling again.  We're going swimming now!
I'm hoping to get some just Rob-n-Sally time esp. so I can inquire
about last night's apparent wackiness.</p>

<p>The pool was freezing (Silly Sally and Rick think it was warm
enough to stay in it for a long time) so I moved to the hot tub and
discovered a table thing in the middle - a vertical tiled column seat
thing that was perfect for pretending to be a dolphin or porpoise
leaping from the water onto the deck for a treat and then lumbering
backwards or sideways into the pool again.</p>

<p>But better than that, I could do a sea otter and slide on my
stomach across the thing like superman or super otter or Silly Rob
playing in the hot tub.</p>

<p>Sally and Rick went back to the pool about the time that a couple
(?) came to the hot tub.  We never exchanged names formally, but I
think he referred to her as Heather once.  As of three weeks ago, he's
no longer doing commercial real estate, but now has a possible job
doing something else in that industry.  I forget the term he used.</p>

<p>She's a school teacher for 7th and 8th grade science.  Xylem and
phloem and Na in H2O - that kind of thing.  She enjoys it, but doesn't
know if she'll do it for 30 years.</p>

<p>They inquired a lot about my adventure; he was interested because
he's actually sorta in a position to do such a thing.  He asked about
finances and I was all, "um.. I just wing it; I've had to release the
whole concept of a budget; I just trust that the universe will provide
for me as necessary."  I nodded to Heather, "this is right out of
_Mutant Message Down Under_..." (she has started the book but not
finished it)</p>

<p>Heather has just recently taken a long road trip; she encouraged me
to see Zion and Bryce canyons; I forget in which order, but she
specified a preferred order.  And the Crazy Horse monument under
construction is awesome she said.</p>

<p>She's been to OZ, wants to go to New Zealand (is there a pronouncable
abbreviation for New Zealand?) and explore a bit.  He's considering
going to San Diego to set up shop down there, but doesn't know if
he'll like it better enough to make it worth the shift.</p>

<p>I didn't have my adventure cards with me, but I verbally gave them
my URL as they were leaving.</p>

<p>Sally and Rick returned from the pool and Sally warmed up in the
hot tub again.  I can't believe Rick did not; the pool was so cold!!
I did one more Super Silly Otter Rob and bruised the muscle above my
kneecap.  D'oh!</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Showers and music and we're about to go out to food and maybe a
movie.  Wow; they are dressed more nicely than me.  He's not way out
of my league, but has on a button down colorful shirt and jeans.  I'm
in shorts and T-shirt, but that's not surprising.</p>

<p>Wow.  Kinko's was a bit tricky for me to find.  But I found it.
Now I've got my bike locked to some steps near a sign that says</p>

<pre>
                                   NO
                                BICYCLES

                               PROSECUTED
</pre>

<p>But I asked the cat at the desk and he was all, "'scoo bro."</p>

<p>So now my car is parked in a place that I don't know how long it
can stay there, my bike is parked in a no biking zone (but at least I
can see it from my vantage point)..</p>

<p>But I'm happy.</p>

do, cold with no warm bed, but instead I'm enjoying the incredible

<p>Munched dinner at Thaifoom (?), a Thai restaurant on (get this:)
Fashion Island.</p>

<p><em>Fashion Island</em>.</p>

<p>Fashion Island is not an island.  It's just a glorified shopping
center have I already said this?  Anyway, whatever; who cares.</p>

<p>Dinner was lovely and included sake, which was poured to
overflowing, symbolizing money is no concern.</p>

<p>I had a meal called "Evil Jungle Princess."  Basically chicken and
peanut sauce and green beans and rice.</p>

<p>Funny:</p>

<p>After finishing my tuna and crackers lunch, I walked to the
trashcan to throw away the tuna can.  The trashcan happens to be
between two outhouses, on one side of the parking lot in which I slept
last night.</p>

<p>As I approached, one of the outhouse doors turned from IN USE to
OPEN and the guy opened the door a bit, presumably to verify the
approaching footsteps were human.  "Excuse me!"</p>

<p>"Yeah?"</p>

<p>"Can you see if there's paper in the other outhouse?"</p>

<p>"Sure."  There was not. "Nope, but I have some in my car; just a sec."</p>

<p>Thank you, Janette, from the cat stranded on the john not at The
Four Seasons.</p>

<p>After lunch, after standing in Tadasana, experiencing the beauty
around me, I remembered I have my library of books to read.  I read
the remainder of _Mutant Message Down Under_ by Marlo Morgan.
Excellent mind broadening book reminding me that the universe is
infinte and can bring me anything I need at any time.  Reminds me to
append all my requests with "if it's in the highest good for all."</p>

<p>I sat meditatively for several minutes after reading, grokking the
fullness of the message.</p>

<p>Took me a while to get back into California speed demon driving
techniques.. then I just switched it on like a light.  zoom to Sally's
and Sock Monkey dialed with his tail again.  It was in the highest
good for all involved for me not to see Sally at that time, so I've
been visiting with Mike who works at Kinko's.  Cool cat.  Quite
friendly.  I wonder if he would enjoy working at Container Store.
hmmm.</p>

<p>I called Sally's cellie from Kinko's phone, told her where I was
and that my phone is dead.</p>

<p>It's hard for me to be non flirtatious with Sally while she's got a
boyfriend.  She's all smoochy on him and saying nice stuff "what would
I do without you?" and "Aw, Rick, you're an angel.." when he does nice
stuff.</p>

<p>But it's not my time right now.</p>

<p>This makes me realize that I'm not loving her unconditionally.  I'm
not 100% happy that she is happy.</p>

<p>I'm open to learning whatever lesson this has for me.</p>

<p>I'm feeling tired now; I don't know if this is my way of checking
out of the situation or what.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I wonder if I'll react by being extra flirtatious when he's gone.
Yikes.  I better not do that.  Better to sleep than that.</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>We were talking about the joke of Moses coming down with three
tablets, "My people, I have from God the 15.. er 10 Commandments"
cause one of the three tablets broke.</p>

<p>So I mentioned that Pope John Paul II recently added 4 thingies to
ponder in the rosary or something, and Sally goes, "Rick, what are
they?" and then joked that he's a bad catholic cause he didn't know.</p>

<p>Then he goes, my sister was amazed that I could quote a bible verse
recently, John 3:16.."</p>

<p>Thanks to Annabeth, and my willingness to do anything for a
hamburger at OB one day, I know that verse.</p>
