&lt;blowing off the dust/>

Hey, look at *this* old item!

So, here is the update on my life:

1) I have broken up with my (ex) fiance' Wende because I was getting
more and more freaked out about getting married.  I ultimately decided
that I just didn't know what the heck I was doing and could not go
through with getting married.  A big part of it is that I have to go
explore a lot more of the world before I'll be ready to settle
somewhere.

2) I therefore have a new apartment and I'll give the address to
anyone who emails me thunderrabbit at cheerful dot com.  We are in the
process of selling our house, which should hopefully be done within a
month or so.  (It went on the market in December, and no one was
looking, but lately the number of showings-per-week is increasing.  I
continue to be optimistic.)

3) I have been taking Spanish classes, and know Spanish kinda-sorta
well enough to get along-ish in a Spanish speaking country.  I am
taking American Sign Language just because it seems like another cool
language.  ASL has been amazingly simple for me to learn compared to
spoken languages.

4) While taking ASL, I met a girl from Japan who is teaching me
Japanese.  So far, I am just learning how to
draw/write/recognize/pronounce the hiragana, which is the basic
Japanese alphabet.

5) With my friend Bryn (*) I'm going to Europe for 12 days or so in
late March, like 14-26 March I think.  We'll hang out in London for
some days and then Paris for some days.

(*) Bryn is a high school youth in YRUU (<a
href='https://www.uua.org/YRUU'>https://www.uua.org/YRUU</a>, Young
Religious Unitarian Universalists, which is the amazing youth program
I loved in my high school days.  I'm now an adult advisor in the
program, which basically means that I'm just there as a resource for
the youth at their conferences and such.  The youth design their own
programs and events, etc.  Excellent for youth empowerment and helping
them develop leadership and interpersonal skills.) who I've known for
6 years.  She and I have been cheerleaders for one another during this
time, always encouraging the other to stretch and grow and achieve the
best we possibly can.  She was interested in a student foreign
exchange program to Australia for a year, and I totally encouraged
her.  (she later said I was the *only* person who never put any hint
of doubt in her mind about her ability to go.)  During her year in
Australia, she learned that it's actually really really easy to
travel, and that our (US) culture just doesn't emphasize going
overseas simply to be immersed in the other cultures of the world.

Bryn knew that I wanted to go overseas, but that I just hadn't gone
through with it yet, etc, so she invited me to be her escort as she
visits the campus of Richmond University where she has been accepted.
I'm totally excited about it!

6) So I'm learning Japanese, and beginning to learn how easy it is to
travel, and I decided that next year, I am going to teach English in
Japan!  I haven't yet applied for any program, but I'm talking to some
of my friends who are teaching English there now, and to a friend here
(Ben, from KTRU) who is going in August, just figuring out how I can
make this happen.  I'm choosing to finish my obligations here that
will basically be over at the end of this year (apartment lease, and
my leadership in our investment club (<a
href='https://genxchange.tripod.com/'>https://genxchange.tripod.com/</a>)

7) I'm still DJing at KTRU, but I have a sense that my days there are
dwindling.  So I started to record my shows again, and I've been
listening to my most recent show from Saturday.  I really like it.
Does anyone know how to transfer cassette to MP3?

8) I'm thankful that you guys continue to chat on BBST so I can just
flitter in and out at random.

<p class=date>9:44am CST Sunday 24 February 2002</p></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Today is Wende's birthday.  I sang her a happy birthday song on
her answering machine.</p></li>

<li><p>Went to Jason's restaurant (yes, Jason Freaky from YRUU) in
Wimberly on Friday (Bannister's Creek View Grill).  I pretty much got
lost on the way and incorrectly backtracked some but finally got there
and we thrilled to find that Shawn Tuthill and friends had written me
a song in honor of my driving in from Houston to eat at Bannister's!
So completely unexpected and great.  I felt so honored!</p>

<p>I met John who helped set up the restaurant and thanked him for
creating a project big enough for Jason.</p>

<p>My mom, Jon (her husband) and my brotha Fred came to eat as well.
We all loved the food, which was very yummy and carefully presented by
the chefs and waitstaff.</p>

<p>After dinner Ma and Jon cruised, while Fred and I stayed to chat
with Jason and watch them close the accounting for the day.  After not
so long, Fred and I decided once and for all, "mental note to self: do
not buy a restaurant."  "ps: do <em>not</em> buy a restaurant."  "oh,
and don't forget, never buy a restaurant."</p>

<p>Hung out at the house where Jason is living 6 hours per day
(otherwise he is at the restaurant) and it's quite nice.</p>

<p>I'm quite taken by how completely different his life is now than it
was one year ago.</p></li>

<li><p>After Jason's, I spent the night at Fred's apt in Austin.  Next
morning we chilled with his roommate Bill and scavenged a bit in the
kitchen.  I stir fried an egg and a frozen fish fillet with some
cheddar cheese on top.  Note to self: thaw the fish first, otherwise
it won't be done before the egg is done.  ps: don't offer this at a
restaurant.</p></li>

<li><p>Talked to Maggie on the way home and even stopped by her house
to offer support.  She and John are getting a divorce.  Contact her
for details.</p></li>

<li><p>Alexis wrote me a postcard from Japan and I'm now writing her a
letter including the amazing news that I can likely come see her next
year!</p></li>

<li><p>Then KTRU, which was quite fun, and I recorded the show.  I was
listening to it today on the way to and from church; I really like the
tape.  :-)  I think I would like to burn my KTRU tapes onto CD or mp3
format, although I'm pretty sure it would be quite illegal to
distribute them without a lot of credit given to the artists, etc.
But just for my purposes to have and hold and cherish.</p></li>

<li><p>After KTRU I drove Camella to her house; she had been at the
station doing whatever she was doing (probably planning for The
Outdoor Show), and asked if I could give her a ride.</p></li>

<li><p>Ultimate after KTRU = fun and cold and muddy muddy muddy.  More
like sloshy standing water on the field in front of each endzone.  I
couldn't run through the mud because of the shells that would easily
slice my feet open.  So I played a lot along the sides of the
field.</p>

<p>The first game, my team lost 8 to 6 or 9 to 7.  They had 6 players;
we had 5.  On the second game, however, (with new teams), my team lost
15 to 13 (have to win by 2 points).  My team again was a player
short.  We did not play a third game.</p>

<p>Tony ragged on Kat a lot it seemed. "You gotta do <em>this</em> in
that situation," or "Kat, throw this type of throw," or "bend your
knee more for that type of throw."  I told Tony, "give her hugs and
love; you'll be with her a long time."  They are affianced.</p></li>

<li><p>Barely remembered that today is Youth Sunday!  I would have
been sad sad sad to have missed it.</p></li>

<p>I got to church in plenty of time for the youth-led service.  There
was very little traffic.</p>

<p>Their theme was Respect, and each youth spoke some on different
aspects of respect.  All the speeches were excellent and considerate
of many issues.  Everyone loved them.</p>

<p>I took notes on the funny things that they said:</p>

<p>Meg:
<br>I developed a cold in the last five minutes.
<br>If you want to leave [during my speech] don't please, because
there will be others speeches that are better.
<br>The media says girls have to play with domestic toys, and that
boys have to play with non-domestic toys...  like dump trucks.</p>

<p>Trevor:
<br>My beliefs are very dynamic on this issue.  When I wrote something
down, five seconds later I wouldn't agree with what I had just
written.  This made it difficult to write a speech.
<br>Principals only care about great TAAS scores and making sure the
school doesn't blow up.</p>

<p>Katy:
<br>Intelligent 'n' articulate human beings. (*)</p>

<p>Amy:
<br>I wanted to join YRUU when I was 12, but the age limits are 14 to
19.  So they let me join anyway.</p>

<p>Peter:
<br>...give everybody a Bob Marley CD and some.. uh, well nevermind.
<br>I like showing my boxers!</p>

<p>(*) 'n' = and but she said it so it sounded like inarticulate...</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>After the service, we ate at Wendy's and listened to Amy's dance
remix of Walk Like An Egyptian.  It wasn't really a dance remix, but
the CD player or tape adapter was making it static rythmically and it
sounded like an extra layer of beats.</p>

<p>Then chilled outside and I told them of my intention to go to Japan
next year.  We had a discussion about rules at rallies and then went
to the park and swing/swang/swung on the swings.  Matt showed me how
to fly like Superman on the swings, but I was pretty front heavy and
almost bonked my head in the dirt.  I barely ripped my shorts doing
some crazy twist manuever in the swings.</p>

<p>Then home.  Actually to work to write these recent entries.</p>

<p>I slept this pm so I could be awake for midnight KTRU croquet, but
the game didn't coalesce and the croquet equipment was locked up in
the station.</p>

<p>I walked around a bit looking for anyone who knew anything and
finally came across Ben, who was just returning from the Pinback show
on campus.  We talked and I mentioned that I'm going to teach English
in Japan, and he was all, "me too."</p>

<p>What???</p>

<p>Turns out that he has been in touch with Alexis (who trained me at
KTRU) who is teaching English in Japan now.  She has been there for 2
years and will be there for one more year!  So I was totally ready to
get hooked up in that same program with Ben and Alexis, but he said
the deadline has passed (for this particular program), plus the
startup date is in August, which I am choosing not to go that soon due
to other responsibilities, etc.   But(!) that since he will be pretty
well established by then, I can just come over and crash in his pad
until I get some freelance English tutoring job or some shit like
that!</p>

<p>How completely totally pimp!  I'm thrilled beyond recognition and
look forward to making this happen.  Awww yeah.</p>

<p>Today after work I'm going to San Marcos for dinner at Jason's new
restaurant.  I invited a couple of my friends, but no one can join
me.  So I invited my fam in Austin.  They'll meet me there, presumably
meet Jason, have great food and great fun.  Then Fred and I will chill
at his house and tell funny stories and such.</p>

<p>I learned 10 more hiragana last night, for a grand total of 35 so far!</p>

<p>The radio said today would be a great and sunny day, so I just got
up, didn't shower, walked to work.  Yep.</p>

<p>I remembered at about 8:40 that we missed 20:02
20/02 2002.</p>

<p>Just chillin' at Dude's now, and peeps are
basically leaving.  Rebecca left first; she seemed to
not be having a great night.  I had been enjoying
talking to her as she was going through my French book
teaching me little tidbits of French.</p>

<p>I felt a bit flirtatious, to the point that I
thought to myself, <em>be careful</em>.  I didn't have
any trouble though since she left early.</p>

<p>Rachel just left; she has to drive four blocks
home, so I we were all, "give us a call so we know you
made it home safely."  She goes, "I'll yell."
hahahah!</p>

<p>Now we're watching Skeleton competition on TV.</p>

<p>Came to work after leaving Dude's around 11:45pm.  I just felt
energized and ready to do some coding in the absence of people.  I
used a din of Front 242, protein of some fake veggie meat from Whole
Foods, and sugar/caffeine of Dr Pepper to keep me going.</p>

<p>I didn't get quite done with this mini project - I've re-vamped the
code that creates a new G3 project in 5 minutes.  It's more flexible
and more programmer friendly.  But right now it doesn't work.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>

<p>We have accepted an offer on our house.  I just signed the contract
and now <a href="https://www.jodilynn.net">Jodi</a> is going to fax it
back to the buyer's agent.</p>

<p>It wasn't for quite as many dollars as I had wanted, but Wende is
definitely ready to be out of the house, and Perry Homes has totally
flooded the market to the point that they are knocking off $15,000
from each home they sell.</p>

<p>I'm thankful that ours is not a Perry home.</p>

<p>Awesome!  Kevin randomly walked out of his office, "anyone up for
some hallball?"</p>

<p>The hall is only 4 feet wide and about 60 feet long, so we had to
be pretty precise in throwing.  He has a Nerf 1/2 football thing that
is relatively easy and speedy and bouncy to throw.</p>

<p>I'm thankful for this short break in our workday.</p>
