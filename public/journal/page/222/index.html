<p>##18:05 Friday 20 February 2015 JST##</p>

<p>Recently I have been posting &ldquo;Daily meditation threads&rdquo; on
/r/bitTippers, encouraging myself and others to take some time to sit
quietly each day.</p>

<p>The posts get about an 80% approval rate, with some people saying &ldquo;wow
thank you!&rdquo; and some saying variants of &ldquo;no way jose&rdquo;. Fun stuff!</p>

<p>Today was the fourth such thread, I think.</p>

<hr />

<p>I worked on a maze for a guy on Fiverr.  It should be pretty neat when
it&rsquo;s done.  Well, the project over all should be neat.  It consists of
9 postcards with a maze drawn across all of them.</p>

<p>His preferred recipient will get just the center card, with maze paths
flowing off the edges of the cards on all sides.</p>

<hr />

<p>Was about to work on AB when I remembered I said I would finish
something for CB today.  I checked the ticket in Redmine and found a
new ticket with priority &ldquo;Immediate&rdquo;, so I did that one first.  It was
my original mistake (ahem) so yeah.</p>

<p>Started working on the ticket I said I&rsquo;d do.  It required some image
duplication (basically extend a ~1500 x 15px png to be ~1750 x 15px and
add some sections to it) which will be visible through CSS.</p>

<p>I finished adding three sections to it and then logged the time in
Redmine.</p>

<p>Hmm; it seems someone already updated the image!  D&rsquo;oh!</p>

<p>I downloaded their zip file (weird for a single image), annnnddd</p>

<p>ohhh I see why it&rsquo;s a zip file.  30 separate images, in jpg format,
with a crappy font, <em>and</em> inconsistent spacing of the text on the
images.  Oh, and a misspelling, AND missing one of the images from the
original png.</p>

<p>Getting feedback from this client is close to impossible, so I just
buckled down and placed the 30 shoddy .jpg images on top of the .png</p>

<p>I actually was <em>not</em> able to get it pushed online, but I uploaded the
.png and my .xcf (Gimp) file up to Redmine.</p>

<h2 id="18-20">18:20</h2>

<p>Right <em>now</em> I&rsquo;m on 東横線 headed to 中目黒 for a Japanese meetup.  I
guess I should switch my head to 日本語モード、だね。</p>

<p>ちょっとドキドキですけどしょうがない、勉強しなきゃ！</p>

<div class="dream">
In a large house with many rooms, a woman was kinda stalking me,
telling me she wanted me to give her a baby; I was like no way and
trying to escape her, through different interconnected rooms and
department store displays.  I ran down a long hallway and downstairs
to where my sane friends were outside and I realized I could fly, so I
flew upwards and wondered if I could fly quickly this time, and found
that I could.  Some high tension power lines were there, but I was
able to quickly fly over them and away.

<p>Great lesson with GG in Akihabara!  They are so inquisitive, creative,
inspiring, understanding, and thankful!  And I&rsquo;m thankful for such a
fun time in lessons with them.</p>

<p>M asked how I met Lin so I got to tell them that story.</p>

<p>I just gotta be careful to let them speak as well!!</p>

<p>Spent 6 hours working on AB site, planning for how to migrate them to
their new server(s) (web + DB).  That was while emailing S about some
problem with server running out of memory.  That ain&rsquo;t good.  I
boosted the allowed memory in config file, but would love to figure
out what the actual problem is (more precisely than there&rsquo;s a lotta
records!)</p>

<p>Oops.</p>

<p>I thought it would be a good idea to hardcode my directory into my
Hakyll binary, so now, until I remember how to build the Hakyll
binary, I have to have it work from the ~/journal directory.  However,
I now want my ~/journal directory to be my new repo consisting of only
journal entries.</p>

<p>I moved the Hakyll version of ~/journal to ~/journal-hakyll and moved
my real journal to ~/journal, then added ~/journal as a subrepository
of the Hakyll journal in ~/hakyll-journal.</p>

<p>That required some gymnastics each time I wanted to test the repo.  To
test the Hakyll journal, I had to swap the directory names back and
then do the test.  But to import any changes from the new journal repo
into the Hakyll journal, I had to re-swap the names to their new
configuration.</p>

<p>Bah, so I manually replaced &ldquo;journal&rdquo; with &ldquo;journal-real&rdquo; in
~/journal/.gitmodules then did a pull to get the latest changes.</p>

<p>Kablam!  git pulled <em>itself</em> as its submodule and my repo got hosed
beyond what I could untangle without access to internizzle.</p>

<p>Hmmm!  I received a request on Fiverr from a guy asking for a maze on
a postcard to be mailed to his friend.</p>

<p>He suggested a maze like the one I made for a guy on Reddit (no
internet access to find the link right now), which starts in the
center and then has four arms radiating outward in different
directions.</p>

<p>The latest request was to make the maze on the card look like a small
part of a larger maze.</p>

<p>So now I&rsquo;m thinking it would be neat to make a set of postcards which
together make up a maze.  Could create a pair of cards with a start
and end on each card, or any number of cards that fit together to make
a full maze!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how people would <em>use</em> them, so I don&rsquo;t think it would
make a particularly popular product, but it could be fun!</p>
