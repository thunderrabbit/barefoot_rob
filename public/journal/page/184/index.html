<p>I bought a carton of peach tea and a carton of milk tea.  I drank the
milk tea and left peach tea on the table, in public, but out of sight
of the shop staff.</p>

<p>Two+ hours later, I came back and it was still on the table.</p>

<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not like Grand Central, but there&rsquo;s a fair stream of
people who come through here.  Thank you, Japanese culture; I
appreciate you leaving my tea for me.</p>

<p>Good. ness.</p>

<p>I just discovered a load of old messages on FB, including a gem from a
gem:</p>

<pre><code>HI Rob!

I'll be in Japan next month; would you like to meet up?

<p>There were <del>two</del> <ins>multiple</ins> side effects that caused
a problem with the live AB server the other day.</p>

<p>I wrote some code, tested it and found it working perfectly.</p>

<p>Added another function call above that code and tested it.  Also
worked perfectly.</p>

<p>Testing complete!  Ship it!</p>

<p>Fortunately, I had asked the client to call me before she ran the code
the first time.  I checked the output and &hellip; hmmm half of the changes
didn&rsquo;t get made.</p>

<p>It turns out that the first-tested code was skipped because the code
above it used the same date-counter to keep track of its biznass.
Oops so the second code detected all its run had been run, when
actually none of them had.</p>

<p>So, how many side effects?</p>

<ol>
<li>not testing properly</li>
<li>literal side effect</li>
</ol>

<p>Nope!</p>

<p>One! The one that comes from not using Hakyll!</p>

<p>So S-san at AB used the new function that I added, but it didn&rsquo;t seem
to fully work.  I tested it locally so I&rsquo;m not sure what&rsquo;s wrong.
Basically it&rsquo;s supposed to edit historical data, but it didn&rsquo;t seem to
work for one set of tables.</p>

<p>While looking at the historical tables to see what had changed, I
found a record missing from all the tables!  Oh noooes!  Did my code
delete it somehow?  Yikes stripes!</p>

<p>Whew found it within 10 minutes because in the history it had been
associated with a different parent record (and I had been searching for it
and its siblings by the parent&rsquo;s ID).  S-san had merged the parent
records, which never before needed to merge historical records, but I
guess now it does.  Poo.</p>

<p>Then she said something else was broken; she can&rsquo;t sort properly by a
certain field (which is cause it&rsquo;s not 3rd normal and the data has
gotten out of sync).  Dang, &ldquo;okay can you make a ticket in Redmine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh I forgot to tell you, Redmine isn&rsquo;t working.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Awwww man.</p>

<hr />

<p>On the app front, Tariq and I released Pongdemonium to all regions,
but App store is saying it&rsquo;s not available in Japan.  itunesconnect says
it is available in Japan.  What to do?</p>

<p>She has really enjoyed her iPad, but can&rsquo;t do real stuff on it, so
we&rsquo;re upgrading her tablet experience to Surface 3. (Though I don&rsquo;t
know if she chose the high end or low end version.  I hope the high
end one so it will hopefully be useful longer.)</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra_Puzzle">Zebra Puzzle</a> features brand names of unhealthy products, so I
changed them into less-unhealthy food items.  I haven&rsquo;t tried to solve it yet, but here&rsquo;s my tweaked version:</p>

<ol>
<li>There are five houses, nationalities, pets, favorite foods, and favorite drinks:</li>
<li>The Englishman lives in the red house.</li>
<li>The Spaniard owns the dog.</li>
<li>Coffee is drunk in the green house.</li>
<li>The Ukrainian drinks tea.</li>
<li>The green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house.</li>
<li>The burrito lover owns snails.</li>
<li>Hamburgers are preferred in the yellow house.</li>
<li>Milk is drunk in the middle house.</li>
<li>The Norwegian lives in the first house.</li>
<li>The man who loves dessert lives in the house next to the man with the fox.</li>
<li>Hamburgers are favorite in the house next to the house where the horse is kept.</li>
<li>The salad lover drinks orange juice.</li>
<li>The Japanese loves raw fish.</li>
<li>The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, who drinks water? Who owns the zebra?</p>

<p>Actually, her name is Francine, so &ldquo;Cine&rdquo; is pronounced &ldquo;seen&rdquo; as an
easier option for Japanese speakers to say than フランシーン.</p>

<p>We just finished lessons in Fukuura for JB.  Chris was supposed to
teach, but he&rsquo;s apparently not fully back from vacation haha.</p>

<p>Francine seems to always have creative fun lessons for her classes.
Plus she just went through Berlitz training and said she learned a
lot.  Nice!</p>

<p>Made some updates on demo3 of the CB site with Satomi.</p>

<p>Today she told me she has an old iMac that will show the Apple icon,
but won&rsquo;t otherwise boot.  I suggested we have a party to take it
apart and see if we can fix it!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m guessing just the hard drive is fooked so replacing that might fix
it&hellip; かな。。</p>

<p>At the toy store I found a take-apart puzzle featuring two loosely
linked nails bent into trianglish G shapes.  They are loosely linked,
but they&rsquo;re hard as nails, and I cannot seem to get them separated.
Seriously, it looks like they&rsquo;ve been mis-created (with automation, is
that even possible??) or somehow &ldquo;forced&rdquo; into an unsolvable state.
But they are so hard, I can&rsquo;t seem to force them back.</p>

<p>I took a picture of a solvable version and an unsolvable version, so
get ready to see those images online within the next 1000 years when I
think about it, have time, <em>and</em> have internet access to post them.</p>
