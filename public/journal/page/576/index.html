<p class=date>7:44pm CST Monday 25 December 2000</p></p>

<p>I have just arrived home.  emacs is working to remove the
eighteenth ring.</p>

<p>Poopy about these past couple of days is that I had typed a ton of
stuff in my Handspring, but it wouldn't turn on now that I'm home.
Are the batteries dead?  How can this be?  I wrote a dream this
morning and didn't get the low battery warning, plus I just put new
batteries in the thing about a week ago, and I haven't used it a lot
since then.  Totally grrrr.</p>

<p>I will maybe attempt to rewrite stuff from yesterday and today.</p>

<p>Today at my mom's we solved a 500 piece jigsaw puzzle that Ma
received from Jon today.  The image was of "The Alphabet Shop" a store
that sold all types of stuff, featuring every letter of the alphabet.
When we were about two thirds of the way done, Wende called and
reminded me that I had forgotten about being back in Houston around
1pm.  It was 2pm when she called.  Doh!</p>

<p>I left after we finished the puzzle, and joined Wende at Jason and
Courtney's house for dinner with peeps from Wende's work.  Jason works
there with her.  Christy (sp) and Mary were at Jason and Courtney's as
well.  Lovely dinner and just random conversation until we left around
6 or 7pm.</p>

<p>I just showered for the first time since Saturday.</p>

<p class=note>written 8:10am CST Tuesday 26 December 2000</p></p>

<p class=date>3pm 24 December 2000</p>

<p>Arrived at Ma's around 3pm and hung out until time to go to the
church for annual candle light Christmas Eve ceremony.  Jon cooked and
loudly slurped lentil soup before he and I left for the church.</p>

<p>At the service, I certainly missed Fred and Karina and Alicia.  My
brother and two step sisters had been at this service the past two
years, but not this year.  I miss random inside jokes with Fred,
random silly comments from Karina, and Alicia's giggles at all the
silliness.</p>

<p>After the service I met a man named Roger who was apparently raised
in Costa Rica.  I briefly described my trip with Kathryn to him and he
described some different sights that we may find interesting next
time.</p>

<p>After cleanup, back to Ma's where we talked and each opened one
gift.  I got a page-a-day calendar with "365 tips to feel healthy &
alive."  Jon asked about KTRU and I described the overall situation
and then we pretty much went to bed.</p>

<p class="date">8:03am CST Sunday 24 December 2000</p></p>

<p class="note">(pre 4am dream:)</p>

<p class="dream">I was at my dad's house and Fred had gotten there
just recently.  We went outside and there was ice over the puddle in
the front yard and dad was showing Fred that late at night the ice was
solid and he could stand on it..  so Fred stood on it, but the ice was
not solid enough and Fred broke through a bit so water seeped up and
made the ice slick and Fred fell onto his back and butt and cracked
the ice more and got soaked with freezing ice water.  I looked out
toward the main road and saw that it was all flooded at the end of the
street and traffic was making big splashes as it drove through.</p>

<p class="note">4am dream</p>

<p class="dream">Wende and I were fishing, and I really don't like to
fish because I cannot believe "they don't have feelings" as some
people say.  Anyway, I caught a fish with smooth skin like a catfish,
and I felt really badly doing it.  I don't know why I didn't just
choose not to catch it.  Wende caught a fish with normal scales.  and
we each also caught a hermit crab.  I tried to kill the fish in the
most respectful way, but it seemed to just die from the hook in its
mouth.  We put it in the frying pan and began to heat it up, and then
the hermit crabs were not actually dead and they began to crawl over
and munch on the fish.</p>

<p class="dream">I was totally like, "I refuse to kill them" to Wende
and and she got mad about that.</p>

<p class="dream">the scene shifted and I was looking at the toilet
across the room where apparently there had gotten a lot of sand in it
from our beach adventure and when it flushed, it backfired and shot
gross black sand water up and hit the ceiling before it flushed
correctly.  I was totally grossed out more by that and mad at the
whole situation where we had to fish anyway.  Ewww.</p>

<p class="dream">someone knocked on the door and I peered through the
peephole.  she didn't look scary, so I opened the door.  She said, HI
and I was like, "wait.. you're Kristen??"</p>

<p class="dream">"Chris" she corrected. "You're Rob?"</p>

<p class="dream">"yeah" and we hugged big because we had heard each
other over the air, but just didn't know what the other looked like.
Neat to finally meet her.  A couple of other KTRU friends came in and
they were all studying for finals or something.</p>

<p class="dream">Kathy Fey was there, and was having some problems
with her computer, so I went to look, and it seemed that the backup
tape utility hadn't been able to backup a certain file, but I wasn't
familiar with this OS, so I didn't really know where to start to fix
it.</p>

<p class="dream">She said it was okay.</p>

<p class="note">8:03am dream</p> 

<p class="dream">Filming a movie I was in, starring Samuel L Jackson,
and I was on the set across the city from him kinda.. see he was
piloting a plane by remote control and it had been a helicopter at
first, but it was a plane and I was trying to tell him where to slow
down and lower the plane so we could jump in and fly it.</p>

<p class="dream">In the previous attempts I was on my bicycle, but had
to go the long way around a construction site thing where they seemed
to be building a chemical plant - with pipes and big dome shaped
containers.  I rode around that and my co star was a woman who I had
never previously met but she ran in front of me as I was riding my
bicycle as we went back toward the beginning of the scene to try
again; the helicopter had way overshot the landing, so the second time
I was telling Samuel L Jackson where to land it.</p>

<p class=date>12:03am CST Sunday 24 December 2000</p></p>

<p>I have just started emacs on the tower of hanoi puzzle with
sixty-four rings.  It just got the sixth ring off the big stack.</p>

<p><a
href="https://writing.colostate.edu/assignments/archives/me514/lab2.htm">https://writing.colostate.edu/assignments/archives/me514/lab2.htm</a>

<p><a href="https://shrike.depaul.edu/~jmak/java/contest.html">Here</a>
is an applet that solves the puzzle, so you can see what I'm talking
about.  Please note that while the rings on this java applet instantly
move from one stack to another, the rings on the lovely emacs version
actually move up from the stack, across the screen and down onto
the next stack.

<p class=date>12:10am</a>

<p>emacs is working to get the ninth ring off.  I'm going to bed.<p>

<p class=date>08:41am</a>

<p>emacs is working to get the sixteenth ring off.  It has clearly
made it further than it had last night when I stopped the previous
process.  It seems this will take a really long time.</p>

<p class="date">09:16am</a>

<p>emacs is still working on the sixteenth ring.  I think it will get
it before I leave for YRUU meeting today.</p>

<p>I'm just about to write letters or something on my newly clean blue
desk thing.</p>

<p class="date">11:01am</a>

<p>I just wrote a few postcards to some of my peeps and filed some
stuff in a scrap book.</p>

<p>Assuming emacs moves one ring per second, I think I just calculated
correctly that emacs will finish this tower of hanoi in 5 * 10^11
years.  Yup.</p>

<p>emacs is still working to uncover the sixteenth ring.  I'm leaving
now until tomorrow afternoon.</p>

<p class=date>7:56am CST Tuesday 26 December 2000</p></p>

<p>On the way to YRUU, I dropped off some bags and boxes of
recycleables at the recycling place on Westpark, just behind Goode
Company.  This place is open 24/7 because there's no one there to
monitor it; just a "driveway" on one side and a fence with big labels
indicating where to throw what type of stuff.  They collect paper,
plastics, clear glass bottles, colored glass bottles, used oil and
used oil filters.  Way cool.</p>

<p>I dropped off paper, plastic and cardboard.  Didn't get to break
any glass bottles this time.</p>

<p>Over to Wende's work to say bye to her and then to YRUU meeting.
No one was there when I arrived, so I went downstairs to see if they
were elsewhere just as they walked in.  Susie, Mark, Cassie, Hethre.
We hung out upstairs and talked until Susie, Meg, and Katy arrived
with Austin.  We watched most of <em>Oliver and Company</em>, which
Hethre poo-pooed because she doesn't like cartoon movies because she
can't touch all the pretty colors.  I certainly understand her
plight.</p>

<p>After the movie we all got nerf dart guns from Susie, Katy and Meg,
and wrapped by Katy.  Youth, chaos and darts flew around the room and
around the church for many minutes, and then out to the park.  By then
it was 3pm, so I said Bye and confirmed that we'll be hanging out on
New Year's Eve, and then overnight at Susie's house.</p>

<p class=date>7:27am CST Saturday 23 December 2000</p>
<p class=note>(dream)</p></p>

<p class=dream>Criscrossing the united states vertically up and down
all the highways seeing every inch of the country, lights lit up behind
the path as if watching the progress on a movie.</p>

<p class=dream>Driving on the highway, in a new city, not quite sure
where we are, but seeing new sights and seeing a car accident, a
wrecker towing a truck with a trailer, all 3 vehicles turned upside
down on the highway.  We arrived in a prking lot and saw a woman who
we had met in previous travels.  I hadn't been able to meet her son
before, but now I did.</p>

<p class=dream>"He's the one who came back across the United States to
thank every individual who helped him," she told her son about me.</p>

<p class=dream>I had essentially hitchhiked across the united states,
at least from Texas to California and met tons of cool people and
gotten all their addresses and then drove back to each of their houses
to say "thank you" after it was all done, making for the most amazing
road trip ever.</p>

<p class=dream>Now I was next to Wende in the car and of all people,
Fred arrived.. My brother with his new girlfriendd from school.  I was
in a total state of LOVE and joy beyond description laughing
unalterably pure happiness.</p>

<p class=dream>I met his girlfriend by tilting back in the seat so I
saw her upside down and she was all, "Whaaassssaaaaaaaaaaaappp!" and
playing silly and Fred had two earrings.  We were all, "whaddya wanna
do?" and I suggested we see that recent movie that just came out, and
I named it.  They were like, "okay,"</p>

<p>then I woke up.  I can't think of the name of the movie now.</p>

<p class=date>5:31pm CST Saturday 23 December 2000</p></p>

<p>I am silly silly silly.</p>

<p>emacs rules.  emacs, being the wonderful godsend of an editor,
knows how to play the tower of hanoi.  I just type M-x hanoi and it
will quickly run through a 7 ring tower of hanoi thing.</p>

<p>I just put a few cool ideas together:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>emacs can play hanoi.</p>
<li><p>linux has a virtual desktop that is 2x2 computer screens in
size.</p>
</ol>

<p>I expanded emacs to a pretty huge size and asked it to play hanoi
with 60 rings.  Sixty.  I started it 5 minutes ago, and it has just now
uncovered the eighth ring from the first stack.  It's 5:38pm.</p>

<p class=date>17:53</p>

<p>Now emacs has uncovered the tenth ring.</p>

<p>I'm going to shower, then KTRU, then ultimate frisbee at UH.</p>

<p class=date>18:26</p>

<p>emacs is working to remove the twelfth ring.  I'm leaving now for KTRU.</p>

<p class=date>23:31</p>

<p>KTRU was fun.  Three hour shift instead of two because it's the
winter semester.  I got a call at 9:30pm for Lizzie, who would
normally be at the station from 9 to 11.  I told the guy she wouldn't
be there until after January 23.</p>

<p>emacs is working to get the fifteenth ring off.</p>

<p class=date>23:58</p>

<p>emacs is still working to get the fifteenth ring off, but I'm going
to stop it.  Not because I'm bored with it, but because I did a little
research and found that the "original" story from India is that some
guys were solving the tower of hanoi problem with sixty-four rings.
It would be preposterous for me to have my computer spend all its
brain power and just do sixty rings.  So I'm going to start it over
with sixty-four.</p>

<p class=date>5:17pm CST Saturday 23 December 2000</p></p>

<p>Today Wende and I installed Elfa shelves in my study over the blue
desk-thing.  They look great!  All my pictures that I will put in
scrapbooks and all my letter writing stuff sits nicely on the
shelves.  In storage at the very top, I have my old DOS 286 computer
from back in 1992 or so.  That's the one where the monitor switch
failed so I installed a pull-chain light switch in its place.</p>

<p>Also great news today!  Bryn has her plane tickets to visit me an'
Wende while we are visiting Irene and Nick for their wedding in
Melbourne in February!  Bryn is essentially in the middle of 1 year
as an exchange student in Brisbane Australia.</p>

<p>Tonight is KTRU night for me.  I'm going to visit work for a bit
beforehand to pick up some CDs that I reviewed.  I swilled them.
("swill" is our term for "reject because the CD sucks.")</p>

<p class=date>3:13am CST Friday 22 December 2000</p></p>

<p>Let the reader know that as I woke up from this dream I thought, "I
should write this down; it's been a while since I've written a dream,"
and I thought, "it's sooo cold!!! I don't want to get up!"  But I got
up anyway, knowing that in the morning I would <em>not</em> remember
the dream.  Good job, Rob.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>Walking down the sidewalk, leading Andy from ultimate
to our house, which seemed to be two stories tall and set back away
from the sidewalk like Dude's house is.</p>

<p class=dream>Down the sidewalk I turned left toward our house.  Andy
followed and parked both his cars along the sidewalk.  He asked if he
parked them okay and we said yeah, we usually pack six cars in this
space.</p>

<pre>
X XX
XXX

(without our house on the left, top view.)
</pre>

<p class=dream>It was raining after I set some pillows outside to lead
the way to our house and the pillows got wet with rain.  I was
squeezing water out of one of the pillows as John and Will arrived, and
Will claimed that he didn't t play ultimate anymore, (a ridiculous
claim if I've ever heard one)</p>

<p class=dream>Scene shifted into a written description of an image of
the letter B as it is viewed while walking through a revolving door.
This was a puzzle/ riddle..  The image was drawn with the letter B
having been rotated 180 degrees and a description in English of the
resulting curves.  I didn't at first understand what it was, but when
I realized it, the image made sense and was trivial to complete.  What
would be more difficult to complete would be the English description of
the B being turned the remaining 180 degrees around the revolving door.
They called it a concentric door instead of revolving door.</p>

<p>- -</p>

<p class=dream>Earlier dream I was showing Erika from work the
foundation of a house that was either my old house after being torn
down or my new house before being built.  It was out in the
countryside and had 1/2 of the structure built and the other half
remaining to be built (or 1/2 torn down and the other half remaining to
be torn down)</p>

<p class=dream>In either case, the foundation was still there
permanently.</p>

<p class=date>3:36am CST Friday 22 December 2000</p></p>

<p>I will be using "emacs convention" when writing this entry.  M-q
means hitting the Meta key (escape) and then pressing the letter q.

<p>Emacs rules.  While formatting the previous entry, I was using M-q
to format text.  This key runs the fill-paragraph command, which
essentially applies text wrapping to the paragraph.</p>

<p>For my examples, I will use the &lt;pre>&lt;/pre> element because
text in the &lt;p>&lt;/p> element is automatically word wrapped by the
browser.</p>

<pre>Okay, here is a line of text that goes on and on in a most blah blah blah fashion and really doesn't say anything but will be our guinea pig sentence for the rest of this writing.  Actually I need to get some longer words like circumlocusive and diminutive ones as the exceptionally diminutive words will not as easily allow emacs to display its amazing skillz which I have intentions of showing the reader.  This should be long enough I hope.

<p>Following is the same line after using M-q on it:

exceptionally diminutive words will not as easily allow emacs to

<p>What I found accidentally is that M-1 M-q justifies the text!

<p>When I first noticed that emacs had justified the text, it took me
a few tries to discover what keys I had mistakenly pressed instead of
M-q.  In that process, I also hit M-1 M-q twice in a row and
discovered that emacs shifted the positioning of the extra spaces
within each line!

<p>This difference is subtle with these short words.  Okay, here are
some longer "words" and M-1 M-q applied to them different numbers of
times:</p>

<p>Okay, even I am totally bored by this now.  Just know that emacs
rules and I love it.</p>

<p>It's 4:03am</p>
