<p class=date>6:44pm CST Thursday 11 January 2001</p></p>

<p>Wende and I had our first couples' counseling session tonight, and
I am exceptionally optimistic.  I went in thinking, "I just want to
see if issues can be resolved before we get married."  In the 50
minute session, I think we uncovered the bulk and core of the issues.
Only fifty minutes!  I left feeling a great deal of love and happiness
for our relationship.  Awesome.</p>

<p class=date>6:48pm CST Thursday 11 January 2001</p></p>

<p>Tonight Wende and I are going to meet Will and Molly for dinner at
Souper Salad!!  Yay!!</p>

<p>Microsoft sucks.  Have I mentioned that?  Yes, Microsoft sucks
sucks sucks.  I've got my new-ish machine here at home with NT 4.0 on
it, and I can't find any information on how to set up a VPN using DSL
as a connection.  It only talks about using Dial-Up Networking, and
therefore, I'm assuming, a modem.  I am now going to look a bit more
to see if I can find it, and then <em>add</em> Dial-Up Networking to
the Control Panel, on the chance that maybe just maybe it is required
for DSL VPN stuff.</p>

<p>Either way, Microsoft sucks.</p>

<p class=date>7:28pm</p>

<p>Okay, I have maybe found it, but I don't know if it will work or
not.  I'm guessing not, and that I will have to invite Duane, our
contract network person to set it up.  Gah.</p>

<p class=date>7:32pm</p>

<p>That clearly wasn't it.  Now I have no access to Internet at
all.  Grrr Microsoft.</p>

<p class=date>9:48pm CST Thursday 11 January 2001</p></p>

<p>Before Souper Salad, Maggie and Molly arrived at our house.  Molly
called Will and picked him up from work as Maggie, Wende and I went to
Souper Salad.  Molly and Will arrived in the salad line just behind
us.  Wende was saying something and Will answered her.</p>

<p>"HI Will!!" exclaimed Wende, and gave him a hug.</p>

<p>We ate, and a man who looked <em>so much</em> like Samuel L Jackson
sat at a nearby table.. I could hardly keep from watching him.  <em>Is
it him?  Is it Samuel L Jackson?</em> I wondered about different ways
to approach him, and then ... what would I say if he were Samuel L
Jackson?  I finally decided I would just say, "I really really love
Pulp Fiction."</p>

<p>He went to the dessert bar, so I did as well.  I stood on the other
side of the sneeze shield from him and glanced up.  Couldn't see him
for the reflection.  He had a glop of whipped cream he was trying to
shake off the spoon into his bowl.</p>

<p>"I have that same problem," I broke the ice, "I have to shake it
real hard and hope it goes into the bowl."</p>

<p>(How's that for an entry on the Wall of Shame?)</p>

<p>He was all, "yeah, and then I'll end up getting too much."</p>

<p>He wasn't Samuel L Jackson.</p>

<p>The rest of my dessert I was able to eat in mental serenity.</p>

HI

I noticed there was no news on Wende and I, and then
when you said you hadn't heard from us, I thought...
Hmmmm, maybe I can help rectify that.  

Wende and I are getting ready for our big trip, by
learning Spanish.  Of course, I'm talking about our
trip to Costa Rica on Friday 21 June 2002 after we get
hitched.

We attended a Leisure Learning class last night - a
free introduction to learning Spanish, so we could
meet the instructor and learn her techniques.  

(English is her fourth language!  She was born in
India, (so she learned Hindi?) and then French, and
then Spanish, and now English.  Wow.)

Wende is busy busy busy at work.  She is scheduled for
9 hour days, but she seems to stay 11 hours instead. 
"It was just so busy," she says.

Computer world has been good for me; they just gave me
a machine that I can bring home, so I can work from
home too!  So very exciting because there are some
random times that I am greatly inspired to be at work
instead of clean toilets at the house; now I can just
run upstairs and say I'm at work!

This coming weekend, I will be the Adult In Charge of
a lock-in at our church, where we expect about 150
youth and 30 or so adults.  Encouraging youth
empowerment, I have let them do all the work getting
ready for the event.  Youth are planning the food,
receiving the registrations, planning the workshops...
 it's amazing how little I have done to plan for it.

And then, in about a month, we'll be going to
Australia - leaving February 12, and returning
February 21.  I can remember those dates because
February 13 - 31 doesn't exist, and February 11 - 11
would be a pretty short trip.  We'll send you a
postcard, if we can find a 1 cent stamp.

Thanks for your consistent updates; now you have ours!

    With Love
    - Rob

<p>Had a crisis at work - Kevin has some reports on his machine and
when he sent out a bunch of emails to have people visit his machine to
get their reports, the machine couldn't handle the load.  So we had to
redirect all the traffic to a different machine that didn't have the
drive space, but could otherwise handle the load.  Now each request
that comes in will copy the report from Kevin's machine to the other
machine and they cansee the report.</p>

<p>Awesome: <a
href="https://8ball.federated.com/">https://8ball.federated.com</a>.</p>

<p>I have just spent several minutes reading and watching this site.</p>

<p>I got to work all early today so I can leave early so Wende and I can go
to our Spanish class tonight.  I still haven't gotten any work done yet,
though.  Doh!  I've been reading my personal email and reading <a
href="https://www5.compaq.com/rcfoc/">RCFoC</a> (where I got the Magic 8 Ball
link).  Okay, now I'm going to work work work on the latest incarnation of
the Ritz Project.</p>

<p class=date>10:00pm CST Tuesday 9 January 2001</p></p>

<p>Wende and I both relatively zipped home from work, and I couldn't
find the registration forms (including driving directions) to the
Spanish class!  So distraught, not wanting to be late, having looked
so forward to attending the class....   I looked all over the house,
called Kevin at work, had him look for them on my desk, nowhere to be
found.  Wende arrived home and even she could not find them.</p>

<p>I determined they <em>must</em> be at work, so we drove there and
found them on my desk, under some other papers on a clipboard.  Kevin
had looked partway through them, but not all the way.</p>

<p>We were late to class, and pretty much got lost finding the
building, but only missed the "theory" part of the class, describing
different ways people learn.  As far as I can tell, we were there for
all the language part of it.</p>

<p>Cool stuff, learning by labeling items - toy cups, cars,
telephones, chocolate... I'll practice:</p>

<p>sugar  azucar
<br>coffee cup  tazo
<br>milk leche
<br>chocolate chocolate
<br>telephone tele'fono
<br>candy dulce
<br>cream crema
<br>tea te'
<br>coffee cafe'
<br>knife cuchillo
<br>spoon caracha
<br>fork tenedor

<p>Hahahah  So I just visited <a
href="https://www.studyspanish.com">www.studyspanish.com</a> because I
couldn't remember the translation for fork.  I see that I
mistranslated spoon, which should be cuchara.</p>

<p>It's possible that we'll be in a class that meets for the next 8
Tuesdays (except that we'll be in Australia for 2 weeks) with Tessy,
our instructor tonight.  She will call us tomorrow whether or not that
will work out.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>After class, Wende and I visited Mission Burrito for dinner.  So
yummy!!</p>

<p class=date>7:49am CST Monday 8 January 2001</p></p>

<p>This morning I've been poring over old mugbooks, (re)memorizing
youths' names.  I recognize that the registrar for the rally
definitely has a distinct advantage in the name recognition area.</p>

<p>So I went online to ask Katherine to send me the list of names of
people attending the rally and found this very cool thing in my
inbox:</p>

<p><a href="https://208.177.130.81/dictator/dictator.pl">Guess the
Dictator and/or Television Sit-Com Character</a>.  You answer
questions as if you are the person, and the perl script will guess who
you are!</p>

<p>I just unied down the street, over the bridge, a couple blocks beyond and
back again.</p>

<p>In the uni's seat, I've been using a 12" innertube, which helps the
comfort level when sitting for extended periods of time.  However, I
discovered it to be flat last time I rode (to and from KTRU, barefoot),
which really hurt the ol' buttocks.  Today I reinserted the foam seat, which
isn't as comfy as the innertube was, but it's more comfy than a flat
innertube.</p>

<p>I didn't make it up the 2 inch discontinuity this time (and I didn't try
to because there were some cars (Lexii) parked just beyond it.  I didn't
want to collide with them).  I didn't even make it perfectly past the big
hump thing, but oh well.  I did roll over the big pot hole curb thing this
time, on the first try.  Nice.</p>

<p>A cop pulled over a car a couple blocks in front of me; I just slowly
wheeled down the blocks and rolled past them.  Turned at the end of that
block and headed back.  Just past the cars, I fell and had trouble getting
back up for a couple of tries, including one face first splat (caught myself
with my hands) which resulted in scraping some bloody scrapes on my left
shin on the pedal of the uni.  Ow!</p>

<p>Rolled back pretty easily, and said HI to some guys who were working on
the bridge.  They apparently only spoke Spanish, so we didn't say a whole
lot, but I showed them how I fell and the blood.  I'm looking forward to
learning Spanish (our first class is tomorrow evening!) so I can speak more
effectively to some people.</p>

<p>Now it's back to work time.</p>
