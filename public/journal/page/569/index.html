<p>I am low on drive space on my linux machine.  I've
got one 8 gig drive and one 1 gig drive installed. 
Well, they were installed, but now they are sitting in
front of me.</p>

<p>I plan to remove the 1 gig drive (which seems to
just have swap space on it), add the 13 gig drive that
my dad gave me, and format part of that as swap space.
 I hope this will all work correctly.</p>

<p>In order to be safe (scared), I might just install
linux on the 13 gig and then add the 8 gig and get all
the data off of that, but I don't know how that would
work either.</p>

<p>Hmmmm.</p>

<p class=date>7:57am</p>

<p>Update:  I remembered my dad said he put some stuff
on the 13 gig for me, so I just booted the machine,
with the drive sticking 1/2 way out of the computer,
sitting on some spanish flashcards to keep it from
shorting out on anything.  The computer gave 4 alert
beeps when I turned it on.  We'll see how it goes.</p>

<p class=date>8:02am</p>

<p>Okay, I removed the jumper so that the drive is now
listed as single instead of master, and it worked. 
But now it's mad that there is no floppy.  I'm going
to make the boot sequence be C: A: and if that doesn't
work, I'm going to leave this and go to work.</p>

<p class=date>8:07am</p>

<p>Now the floppy is attached, but it's on as drive B:
instead of A: because the cable won't reach, as the
drives appear to be spewed out the front of the
machine.  I haven't run downstairs to get a
screwdriver to take the drives out of the removable
bay and make them connect to the correct cables.</p>

<p>Wait!  I found a screwdriver right here!</p>

<p class=date>8:22am</p>

<p>Okay, I keep getting</p>

<pre>Floppy disk(s) fail (40)</pre>

<p>after it finds the CD ROM.  I don't know why.  Oh,
and I'm pretty sure I was wrong above about the A: vs
B: thing..  I think the A: drive is the one on the end
after the wire twist.</p>

<p>Now I'm leaving for work.</p>

<p>We just got back from seeing <em>Cast Away</em>.  I
really enjoyed it, though Wende did not as much
because of all the unfinished questions at the end.  I
was quite impressed with the special effects of the
plane crash.  Following Chuck's four years on the
island was pretty cool too I thought.  It appealed to
the savage boy scout in me.</p>

<p>I totally cried when he lost Wilson.  That seemed
really sad to me, losing a daily companion of four
years.  Certainly he thought, "if I had only tied him
on better.."</p>

<p>Chuck said, "I'm sorry" a lot.</p>

<p>It made sense to end the movie with Chuck out in
the middle of nowhere, certainly a more comfortable
place for him by that point.  I think he hooked up
with the girl in the truck after the movie ended.</p>

<p class=date>10:10pm CST Thursday 25 January 2001</p></p>

<p>Wende and I attended our third couples' counseling session today.
During the session, I described how I often seem to have
<em>-*!boundless!*-</em> energy and I don't always know what to do
with it.  While listening to me, our guy said it sounded like I have a
desire for "instant gratification."</p>

<p>?</p>

<p>Instant Gratification, like anything you want, you want <em>right
now</em>.</p>

<p>That suddenly reminded me of my palm reading session with Richard
Unger back some years ago, when he correctly assessed "you want to be
able to wake up in the morning and say "airplane" and fly anywhere I
want to in the world."  He had a couple of other examples and all
through it I was all, "yes yes yes!  exactly so!"</p>

<p>Then he looked at my fingerprints and said, "in this lifetime, you
are asked to build something for the world."  As he said that, tears
started to well up in my eyes - a combination of "oh my gosh that is
so awesome" and "I always knew that; thanks for noticing" and "holy
shit!"</p>

<p>Wende chimed in at this point as I relayed the story, "So Rob takes
this phrase 'build something for the world' and thinks he has to
<em>build</em> something for the world.  He doesn't see how on a daily
basis he so positively affects the lives of youth in YRUU.</p>

<p>Tears again began to well up as she said that.</p>

<p>Our counselor was all, "do you ever have Happy Tears?"</p>

<p>"Yes.  like right now because I just love my youth so much.  I'll
do anything for them."</p>

<p>"Excellent.  I'm going to give you a homework assignment.  This is
one you can do for the rest of your life: Every time you have Happy
Tears, write it down.  Keep a journal or something." [ed. note: little
does he know!]</p>

<p>"Okay."</p>

<p>"Your Happy Tears will lead your life through the most wonderful
journey imaginable."</p>

<p>"So then I think <em>why am I in this stupid job??</em> and stuff."</p>

<p>"It's just a means to an end."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I have heard all this before, except for the suggestion of writing
down my Happy Tears moments.  I can do that.  I just did.</p>

<p>We've been interviewing people at work basically to
get another programmer.  The first guy called in
saying he couldn't make it, the second guy was quite
interested in benefits and vacation, the third guy
seemed pretty great but maybe a bit light on database
knowledge, and the fourth guy seems pretty cool, but I
haven't spoken with him yet.</p>

<p>I've been reading around attrition.org, and have
actually decided to link to them, though I might not,
now that I doubly think about it.  We'll see later.  I
will almost certainly remove the banner at the bottom
of my front page.</p>

<p>I thought of a pretty cool thing that might work
for displaying perl source code.  If it works, I'll
use it on my days old counter, which I still haven't
officially published yet, but may sometime this
year.</p>

<p>Super duper awesome kudos to Travis, a KTRU DJ
whose KTRU bumper sticker has been modified to form
kanji characters that read "the white guy who can
speak japanese" for so promptly sending me information
on shareware that can help s print Japanese, Chinese
and Korean characters on our webbrowser!</p>

<p>Special thanks to my brain for remembering Travis'
email address after I had heard it once a couple
months ago.</p>

<p>We are still in the running to host a survey that
will be displayed in 19 different languages. 
Awesome.</p>

<p>Yesterday I mostly designed datasets for a new
project that will have to integrate with some old
school datasets and maybe even help us reduce the
amount of code we have even more.</p>

<p>Wende and I went to Spanish class, and it was
pretty cool.  The instructor had us choose names and
"professions" and where we're from, beginning an
elaborate game to help us learn spanish as if we are
living it.  Should be pretty cool.</p>

<p>I have decided to learn Japanese after(?) I learn
Spanish.</p>

<p>I'm here at the Warrior Lodge before I group, just unwinding my brain by
sitting in a still manner.</p>

<p>I have found myself not using my Handspring Visor as often as I "used to"
to write journal entries.  I wonder if how much I will use it in a year or
so.</p>

<p>Today I talked with Lawren on AIM.  Turns out her family has a lot of
acres and cows, chickens, a dog, five cats and a horse named Whisper!  Very
cool to learn new things about people.</p>

<p>I was reading on <a
href="https://www.attrition.org">https://www.attrition.org</a> about different
hacker shit.  Depending on the point of view, the internet world is full of
security flaws that must be addressed.  Or there are just so many sites out
there that the chance of a particular site being hacked is minimal.  I guess
not for high profile sites or "high security" sites...</p>

<p>A group called Pent-somthing hacked several sites across 3 different
countries all at the same time, regardles of timezones, and across entirely
different systems.</p>

<p class=date>6:22 pm</p>

<p>Peeps are arriving now.</p>

<p>Awake and at Northwoods church.  Jackie is here as a first time person.
We are discussing the youth sunday service..  I have encouraged the group to
create a something that can become part of the church's history.. like a
large canvas painting or omething.</p>

<p>They're going to have the congregation write questions to ask the
youth.</p>

<p class=date>1:41 pm</p>

<p>Now at Emerson for rally debriefing meeting and it's so chaotic.</p>

<p class=date>1:52 pm</p>

<p>chaos chaos chaos, but we are slowing getting stuff done.  They are

<p>I moved Meagyn to sit away from Carlie, Matt, Ryan because of
disruptions.</p>

<p>For the first time in quite a while, I got to see a new episode of
Futurama!!  Yay!!!  It's been interrupted for the past several weeks
by stupid football games.  I have heard that the superbowl is next
week, and I assume that will be the last week the Futurama is
preempted for football.</p>

<p>The episode was great - Fry got worms and his friends shrunk
themselves and jumped inside his body (like Innerspace) but the worms
actually made him better so Lela tried to foil their efforts.  Great
episode.  I love Futurama!</p>

<p>I shift gears (heh heh) to riding my unicycle from the stadium parking
lot all the way to Sewall hall, where the Mandatory KTRU DJ meeting starts
at 4pm.</p>

<p>Crappy is that it's sprinkling cold cold rain and it was a pretty longish
ride for a silly Rabbit who forgot his sweatshirt and sweatpants.  I do have
shoes and socks on though (and shorts and T-shirt).</p>

<p>The temperature is probably 44 degrees with essentially no wind.  Maybe 2
or 3 miles per hour.</p>

<p>Certainly not as fast as the guy who just ran up.</p>

<p>Anyway, the door is locked to the room where we are supposed to meet, so
I'm sitting on the concrete and inlaid brick floor.  I'm surprised no other
DJs are here yet.</p>

<p class=date>3:52 pm</p>

<p>Two other people tried the door within the last 90 seconds (and here
comes another), but they left.  I was doing deep breathing exercises ith my
eyes closed so I didn't see them.</p>

<p>Deep breathing helped to keep my self warmed up.</p>

<p class=date>5:24 pm</p>

<p>Meeting is over.  I'm back at my car, cold, but not wet.  Very thankful
to be dry right now.</p>

<p>I sat by Travis, front and center for the meeting.  He told me that he's
creating a kanji bingo to help people learn that language.  Awesome.  He's
also applying to work in Japan next year or so.</p>

<p>I met Donna at the meeting.  Actually, she determined who I was somehow
and approached me.  As soon as she walked up to the front of the room, I
knew who she was.  No real tangible reason why I knew; I just did.</p>

<p>Holly, the DJ whose voice I fell in love with even before I was a DJ, has
been accepted into medical school.  Yay Holly!  This is her last semester at
KTRU.  I'll miss her voice on the air.</p>

<p>Now I'm going to stop by work to transfer this into my website.</p>
