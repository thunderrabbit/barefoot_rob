<p>I'm at the theater with Madison, watching the ads
before we watch <em>Hannibal</em>.  I've heard the
movie is just gratiuitous guesome chop chop chop, and
nothing like the psychological thriller Silence of The
Lambs, which I really liked.</p>

<p>- - - - - -</p>

<p>The movie has just started and I'm already grossed
out and intrigued.</p>

<p>- - - - - -</p>

<p>wow I amm  lliteralllly about to pass out.</p>

<p class=note>(outside theater)</p>

<p>Holy fuckin' shit.  I only got to the first scene
that was filmed as a memory of Hannibal.</p>

<p>The weirdest thing happened - I was averting my
eyes, as I often do in particularly gory movie scenes,
but the audio alone was too much.  I tried to be a
brave movie watcher, but I just felt this pass out
feeling.  It's the same feeling I had when I saw my
friend Nancy have laser surgery done on her eyes.</p>

<p>Afterward, a nurse had said that when the heart
gets going too fast, the brain will close off the
valve that sends blood to the brain so that the
vessels won't aneurism in the head.</p>

<p>That's what happened to me.  valve closed off, no
blood in brain, Rob almost passes out.</p>

<p>I'm outside now as I type this; I'm going to go
back in.</p>

<p>- - - - - -</p>

<p>I think this movie counts as pretty psychologically
thrilling.</p>

<p>- - - - - -</p>

<p>wow this is a messed up movie</p>

<p>- - - - - -</p>

<p>that was a fucked up movie.  wow.</p>

<p>-------------</p>

<p class=date>11:31pm</p>

<p>I'm at work listening to NIN, transferring my entry
to my website when Jen said HI on Yahoo! Messenger. 
Here's a sampling:</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Rob</font>:  I just saw
Hannibal
<br><font color="#FF0000">Rob</font>:  so so so so
scary
<br><font color="#FF0000">Rob</font>:  don't go see it
<br><font color="#0000FF">Jen</font>:  I haven't seen
it yet...I've heard that most people didn't like it
<br><font color="#FF0000">Rob</font>:  It was an
excellent film, 
<br><font color="#0000FF">Jen</font>:  Well, if it was
excellent, why shouldn't I see it?
<br><font color="#FF0000">Rob</font>:  just *really*
gross and *really* gross and *really* gross
<br><font color="#0000FF">Jen</font>:  Hmmm...ya don't
think I could stomach it?
<br><font color="#FF0000">Rob</font>:  ...
<br><font color="#FF0000">Rob</font>:  I will preface
this by saying "I know I got sick at that 3D movie,
but"
<br><font color="#FF0000">Rob</font>:  I had to leave
the theater for a bit
<br><font color="#FF0000">Rob</font>:  My experience
was not "motion sickness"
<br><font color="#FF0000">Rob</font>:  but I began to
pass out
<br><font color="#FF0000">Rob</font>:  I began to pass
out because my heart was all THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP
THUMP and the arteries that go to my brain got shut
off so I wouldn't have an aneurism
<br><font color="#0000FF">Jen</font>:  Whoah
<br><font color="#FF0000">Rob</font>:  That's how it
was explained to me why people pass out
<br><font color="#FF0000">Rob</font>:  yes
<br><font color="#0000FF">Jen</font>:  I remember
hearing that somewhere
<br><font color="#FF0000">Rob</font>:  So yeah, I say
it was excellent, but just too much on the
psychological gore department
<br><font color="#FF0000">Rob</font>:  It was not as
gory as Nightmare on Elm Street, but..
<br><font color="#0000FF">Jen</font>:  I hear that
<br><font color="#FF0000">Rob</font>:  with the
combination of the psychological genius of Hannibal,
it was too messed up for me.
<br><font color="#FF0000">Rob</font>:  (It was close
to that gory though)
<br><font color="#0000FF">Jen</font>:  Gotcha
<br><font color="#FF0000">Rob</font>:  And maybe it
was just as gory; I saw NM a long time ago
<br><font color="#FF0000">Rob</font>:  There!  My
official review of Hannibal!  Thanks for helping me
with it!
<br><font color="#0000FF">Jen</font>:  Yay!</p>

<p>This is funny in a shame-on-you-webmaster-for-not-thinking-of-this
way.</p>

<p>Visit <a
href="https://www.spellchecker.net/">https://www.spellchecker.net</a> and
click on [Virtually Any Text Box] on the right hand side.  Now click [View
the To Do List Demo].</p>

<p>(Or just click <a
href="https://www.spellchecker.net/demos/to_do.htm">here</a>)</p>

<p>See the box that looks like this?

<p><b>Description:</b>
<form><textarea name="Body" cols="33" rows="4" wrap="virtual">This is an
xample of some text with mispellings. Feel free to replase it with your own
text.</textarea></form></p>

<p>I clicked on [Spell Check] on their site and when it offered replacements
to the misspelled words, I clicked [Add].  Now when I click on [Spell
Check], it thinks everything is fine.</p>

<p>That is funny.</p>

<p>Okay, it's not as bad as I thought, but it's certainly not optimal:</p>

It found the misspellings when I ran it the first time.  It must be
storing them in cookies.  In fact, it is.  What's more interesting is
that the same series of four cookies got set *three* times before it
started to spell check the text.  Also, when there were no errors, it
didn't load the ad banners.  So this webmister (not "master") not
only doesn't think of everything, he writes lame code, too.

<p>I don't know who came up with the term "Dog And Pony Show," but
that's what I was asked to give our clients regarding the new G3 model
of surveys.  They called me at 8:30am and I was all "yo" and showed
them all the cool things about G3.</p>

<p>They were duly impressed.  Some minor changes were requested, and
one not so minor request.  I finished all the minor requests today and
will work on the not so minor request tomorrow.  There's also one fix
that I know needs to be changed, but they didn't specifically request
it.</p>

<p>The coolest change I did today was allow each anchor to have its
own value and to possibly be highlighted to draw attention to it.  For
example, in a list of 6 anchors from Very Satisfied to Very
Unsatisfied, we might highlight option Not Applicable.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I need to allow the administrator ability to change the
survey type an individual is using, and turn off the
"I've-seen-the-instructions" flag if a user is upgraded to a
participant, because they haven't seen the participant instructions
yet.</p>

<p class=date>4:41am CST Tuesday 27 March 2001</p>
<p class=note>(dream)</p></p>

<p class=dream>In an office, talking to my dad and waiting for him to
be done working, I could hear a woman talking in the other room and I
was bored so I went outside to go swing on the swing set.</p>

<p class=dream>walked out the steel door and was careful to close it
behind me so it would be locked.</p>

<p class=dream>walked down the outdoor steps and then walked barefoot
through the trodden trail in the tallish grass to the back corner of
the property of the building where there was a swing on a tree
branch.</p>

<p class=dream>I tried to swing really high and touch a big branch
with my feet, but I never could get high enough to touch it.  But I
wasn't so high that I got that jerk from the swing being slack and
then tight at the top of my swing.</p>

<p class=dream>I was talking to a man sitting beside the swing along
the back fence and he offered me a ride in his private jet.  I was
like, sure! and it was actually Meg from KTRU's jet and she was in the
pilot seat.  I got into the seat behind her, and then noticed there was
a passenger seat on the front left hand side, so I asked if I could
just get in there.</p>

<p class=dream>No problem, so I crawled over the back of the seat and
sat in the passenger seat to the left of Meg.</p>

<p class=dream>She pulled forward in the jet and taxied around the
property, making a U turn around the property back to the back corner
of the fence.  We were aimed out toward my street, as if on a drive
way.</p>

<p class=dream>I was seated behind Meg again, and there was some kid
beside me.  Meg had already said that we didn't have enough fuel
to do any fancy dives and stuff, but I certainly wasn't going to
complain, but I sure couldn't understand why he was still riding
around after he had already gotten to ride.  He was just additional
weight or our fuel capacity to handle.</p>

<p class=dream>Meg asked how far it was to the street, and I told her
about 100 yards. I didn't know if it was enough room for the jet to
accelerate and take off, plus there was a really small gate that I was
impressed the jet could it through. but Meg checked her flight
instruction manual to see how to handle this situation and all was
okay.</p>

<p class=dream>I imagined us being able to barely clear the traffic
when we flew over the street, then I realized, "I have to write this
down!!"  I wanted to capture this wonderfully exciting moment!</p>

<p class=dream>I got out my Handspring visor and started typing:</p>

<pre>
I can't believe I'm in Meg's jet about to fly!
We are sitting here now, but about to take off
</pre>

<p class=dream>We pulled forward much slower than I thought and were
no where near takeoff speed when she turned left into the street.  We
were lucky there was no car right there.  A car was further down on
the let side coming toward us, but it was far enough down to get out
of the way.</p>

<p class=dream>Meg accelerated down the street and I was writing in my
physical book journal:</p>

<pre>
We just pulled into the street!
and now we are speeding up
</pre>

<p class=dream>as we were underneath the telephone wires crossing the
street, I wondered how she would "squeeze' up between them when we
took off.</p>

<p class=dream>But we never did take off.  There was not enough room
and the kid beside me was getting all mad, when it was really his fault
that we were too heavy to fly!</p>

<p class=dream>Someone was yelling at Meg, and I didn't understand why
he was complaining; he had already gotten to ride.</p>

<p class=dream>I wasn't sure that I was writing it down in my diary,
but I could hear the pen lightly scratching on the paper, so I knew it
was being recorded *somewhere* and I could just transcribe it later.</p>

<p>Then I woke up and was all "damn I wasn't writing it down after
all."</p>

<p>Note to self:  if you're not sure if you're writing something down,
you are dreaming!</p>

<p>I'm really enjoying our spanish class.  We reviewed estar and ser
and some adjectives for each.  We are just now really getting into the
conjugation of verbs and forming meaningful sentences.  Our homework
is to describe as many things as we can about ourselves - anything we
can make up or whatever.</p>

<p>Wende and I have the suggested Spanish Verb Tenses books.  I'll be
going through that a lot.</p>

<p><em>And</em>, after 30 March, I will begin talking to Travis about
how to learn Japanese!</p>

<p>After I learn Japanese, I think I'll learn ASL, American Sign
Language.</p>

<p>For many years I have "wanted" to learn other spoken languages, but
just never took the time to do it.  I know so many computer languages
that it's just silly for me to not know some spoken languages.  I'm
super duper extra glad that I'm correcting this now.</p>

<p>And, even as I'm just now beginning to learn one other language, I
am reminded of my (and Maggie's) Physics II instructor, Hamdi (I think
that was his name).  He said, "if I misspell a word, it is only
because I know so many languages and it can be hard to keep track of
them."</p>

<p>Back then I was all, "psh - what a braggar and a wuss. waddya mean
ya can't keep track of them?"  I didn't say that to his face.</p>

<p>Now I have noticed myself have trouble remembering how to spell
some words in English.  What an interesting lesson in life.</p>

<p>(5 May 2001) I found this in my Handspring Visor,
but I don't completely remember writing it.  I know I
wrote it, but I remember writing it as if longer ago
than 26 March, but that's the date that showed up on
it.  Hmmm.</p>

<pre>
I'm noticing how we talk talk talk a lot and try to
figure out the best process and democrtic technique
for doing things and the most empowering..

I've just realized this is part of the beauty and
challenge of our denomination.  The beauty is
empowerment, and the challenge is how to teach
empowerment, and how to implement empowerment.

Adult men have the world power.. what power do youth
want?  Simply to create their own programming and to
experience  this creation and implementation.

Our YAC has summed up what we plan to do this year
with one tagline:  Connecting local youth to
continental events.    What if SC and YC had such
taglines around empowerment?

We think think think so much too much sometimes.. to
our detriment in some cases.  Simply be; live from
your heart.  Love yourself.  Love the community.

--------

9:25am

Something about how to get the resources from
continental to local level.  I didn't even know
continental level existed until I was a senior.  Or I
was too afraid of attending ...  those were some of my
own issues around having money... but how to teach
local youth what exists?
  
A 'curriculum' that includes awareness of Continental
stuff?  
Mandatory training?
Mandatory addition into big continental list?

I think a core issue is that UU adults do not *have*
to do anything.  They do not have to believe anything.
 How can communication of any pointed ideas traverse
such a network?

There is no bible; no mandatory or even super greatly
encouraged reading.   How can we ensure that people
know what is available?

9:40am

What we have are a few outrageously committed youth
who want to get the word out and do all these
incredible great and amazing things.. but the
resources are invisible or unaware of where the
resources are needed.  The outrageiously committed
youth overcommit and burn out...   school + family +
jobs + YRUU = a lot to work on.

9:49

The youth who are interested will get the information
if possible.  Is it feasible to create the astonishing
YRUU resource and index it,  cross reference it, 
SYNAPSE online is a great start.  all the rest of YO
publications deserve to be online.   This idea seems
infeasable...    The youth office is exactly the
resource I'm talking about but it's overworked and
(still?) understaffed??

What if YACs could contact all their local churches
and shout 'Good God man, do you know what is
available????'

-----

What if when a church joins the UUA, they must give a
youth contact?  Is that too crazy or what???

<p class=date>9:33pm CST Sunday 25 March 2001</p></p>

<p>Munched dinner with my dad and his girlfriend Karen and her
daughter Elise this evening at Hobbit Cafe.  This is part of their
Christmas present request - dinner with me and Wende once per month.
We missed last month, but now have scheduled our dates for April and
May.  I also told them my next age celebration:  I will be 11500 days
old on 18 September 2001!</p>

<p>Karen has a Handspring Visor and Stowaway keyboard like mine
now!</p>

<p>After Hobbit Cafe, we visited Amy's Ice Cream, where I got Mexican
Vanilla and White Chocolate ice creams mixed with peanut M&Ms.</p>

<p class=date>9:38pm CST Sunday 25 March 2001</p></p>

<p>I started a new project last night - I'm archiving all my old
letters that I began collecting in 1985.  I'm putting them in acid
free storage boxes (instead of the cardboard I had them in) and
labeling sets of letters with who the letters are from.  Mostly people
from rallies and church stuff.  A couple from my family and school and
astroworld.  Amazing to find all these names again!</p>

<p>As a result of my discovery, I have written 6 postcards to various
(most recent) addresses I have for people.  I wonder if any of the
cards will get to the intended recipients...</p>

<p>I'll definitely let you know!</p>

<p><em>TOK!!!</em></p>

<p>On my way to church, a something hit my windshield
and chipped it.  Dammit!!!  I just bought this
windshield a few months ago.</p>

<p>At church we talked about our next show, and they
want to get a quite popular group - we might even have
to find a larger venue.  We'll see how it goes!</p>

<p>I got a message from Holly at KTRU when I got home.
 I turned in a CD after reviewing it, but I  forgot to
include the CD in the case.</p>

<p>I  figured I must hae left it at work..  Drove to
work and cleared off my whole desk and didn't find it.
  Just as I was about to give up, I shifted from panic
search mode to allowing the CD to come to me.  I 
looked underneath my desk and didn't find it, but... 
ah.. I saw my computer; I had left it in the CD drive
of my computer.  (I looked in my CD player, which is
what I used  to listen to CDs because my computer
doesn't have a soundcard.  But I had tossed the CD
into the computer to have Real Jukebox look up the
song names of the CD so I didn't have to type them all
in.</p>

<p class=date>7:11am CST Saturday 24 March 2001</p></p>

<p>Happy birthday to my Dad's Mom and to my cousin Pete!</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>Driving on a street and I needed to park on the side,
but a truck was bearing down on me from behind, so I dropped Scott
into second gear and sped up really fast but then was way too far away
to park.  So I turned around in a parking lot and drove back the other
direction on the street and turned around again in another parking
lot.  Or I was going to turn around and I parked my car there for a
moment and walked out of the parking lot to investigate where I could
park my car and a guy followed me out of the parking lot.  I thought
this was a bit odd, but I walked back into the parking lot and he
followed me back in.  He had pulled a car out of its parking space for
me to drive, and pointed to it as if, "here, I pulled your car out for
you as a nice gesture so you'll be willing to drive me somewhere."</p>

<p class=dream>I looked and it wasn't my car, so I said, "Push that
car back in its place, and I will take you with me."  So I got in my
car and started it, but I was a little blocked into the space and
couldn't get out of the parking lot.</p>

<p class=dream>The guy who had pulled the other car out for me was
having more trouble putting it back in place because he didn't know
how to drive a standard.  He had been able to simply pull it out
(backwards) but had to put the clutch in to push it forwards into the
space.  He finally discovered this and got it back in place.</p>

<p class=dream>scene changed</p>

<p class=dream>In a house with new people and was being asked to drive
to a party or something and encouraged to come back with a "package"
that had a bunch of different drugs and/or alcohol in it.  I was with
a group that didn't know me really well and I was all, "I've never
been drunk" and "I've never done drugs."  They were surprised, but
still wanted me to do this for them.  I didn't want to be in
possession of anything if we got caught, but I was being peer
pressured pretty effectively and might have done it.  I was imagining
the consequences and how much trouble I would *really* be in if my
passenger had the drugs and I was just the driver.</p>

<p class=dream>It was getting pretty late I thought, but the clock
seemed to say only 9:55 or 10:50 pm.  I couldn't really tell because
both hands were the same length.</p>

<p class=dream>I walked out the front door, and I had my shoes in my
hand.  Actually two pair.  I had my shoes and Wende's white Keds.
While I was walked toward my car,

Just as I was about to leave with a guy to go on this
errand, Tori and Emma arrived to visit from Australia!  They came in
though the back door, so I ran around to the back of the house to
say HI to them and some people were all, "Oh Rob came back to say HI
to you guys,!" but they were already running toward the pool and I was
like <em>hey I just wanted to say HI</em> but I woke up before I got
to see them or hug them.</p>
