                        <p class=date>2:59am Tuesday 1 January 2002</p>

<p>Right now Gene and I are at Dude's (after having
had to wake up Veronica to let us in because Gene
forgot his keys) and have just turned on the movie
<em>Art of War</em> with Wesley Snipes.</p>

<p class=date>5:am Tuesday 1 January 2002</p>

<p>Last year, we went to John's house (Dude and I went
in Dude's truck, and Gene and Vero in his 2001
Camaro).  A guy rear-ended Gene on our way to the
party.  Not a bad wreck, but messed up the bumper a
bit.  But the thing is, the guy didn't have a license,
nor insurance,... and it wasn't his car.</p>

<p>We waited 1.5 hours for the cops (and let me assure
you, it was pretty cold outside) and when she arrived,
I was like <em>wow</em>.</p>

<p>Cute blonde cop who quickly took control of the
situation.  She queried everyone standing around, "who
are you?  Are you the driver?  Are you the owner?  Who
are you?" etc and everyone who was not actually in
either of the two cars she was all, "go back to your
car (get out of the way)"</p>

<p>My car was Dude's truck, but Dude had continued on
to the party (since he slightly has a warrant out for
his arrest for not paying a ticket) so I just walked
around a bit while she interrogated and took notes,
etc.</p>

<p>I migrated back to Gene's car as she was finishing
up, and actually by the end, she was cracking jokes
with us.  We got to leave at 11:35pm</p>

<p>"These guys, however," she told us, "are going to
be hating me in about 4 seconds.  But who cares,
right?"</p>

<p>Apparently they were to get lots of tickets for
various things.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>At the party I met two interesting people:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Ella, who is tall with pretty eyes and smile, who was drunk and
smokes and apparently has a kid was flirting with me pretty
effectively.  She mostly had her eye on John the host, but she talked
to me some, claiming to have all the same favorite musical artists as
me.</p>

<p>"What's your favorite music?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Beastie Boys."</p>

<p>Her eyes lit up, "really?  Me too!!"</p>

<p>I'm thinking <em>wow; maybe we have something in common</em></p>

<p>Then she goes, "what's your favorite album?"</p>

<p>"Paul's Boutique.  I just loves all the <a
href="https://www.moire.com/beastieboys/samples/">samples</a>."</p>

<p>"Me too!"</p>

<p>Now I'm thinking, <em>too convenient.</em>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Later in the evening, I was all, "what's <em>your</em> favorite
music?"</p>

<p>She blinked.  "Beastie Boys, right?"</p>

<p>HAhahahahahaaaaa!!</p>
</li>

<li><p>Martha, the "mom" of the family, who has been a friend of the
family for some years, and seems to be 100% mother quality person, and
who speaks Spanish, calls everyone mijo (short for mi ijo = my son) or
mija (my daughter), and said she'd be glad and delighted to spend time
speaking Spanish with me whenever I wanted to come over.
Awesome!</p>

<p>Martha apologized for Ella.  I laughed, "hey don't worry about it;
this kinda thing can be expected at such parties."</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>By the end of the evening, Gene and I were sitting at the table
grubbing on the remains of the food that had been eaten at the party.
Lots of good stuff.  Ella and John were across from us, Martha at the
head of the table.</p>

<p>It's 5:22am now.  I'm going home to b-e-d bed.</p>

<p>At 4pm is our tribal party (Tribe = my college gang) at our house.
Uh oh, Bad Bunny!  I was supposed to vacuum yesterday.  I'll go do
that now.</p>

<p>I think I'm going to really enjoy 2002.  I mean really really
really enjoy it.  I just <em>*love*</em> that it's a palindrome; I can
type it really quickly!!</p>

<p>2002!  Whooo!</p> 

<p>2002 2002!</p>

<p>2002!</p>

<p>Wow.  That was fast.</p>

<p>Chillin' at Dude's and have just scanned about 15
pics that will be on my website soonishly.  Pics from
Australia that Bryn took and some pics from the great
flood of 2001.</p>

<p>Just now Dude and I left for the party and Veronica
called before we were too many blocks away, "the dogs
escaped!"</p>

<p>So we looked for the dogs, including filing a lost
dog report at the local cop station.  Veronica found
them soon thereafter.  Now we're regrouping back at
Dude's and Veronica and Gene will be joining us this
time.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Uh oh - Dude just turned on <a
href="https://www.thescreensavers.com">The
Screensavers</a> on TechTV, his favorite show.  They
are going to show something on IT, the Segueway.</p>

<p>After shopping for a 1/8" drillbit for my marble track, and food
after which I was blocked in the parking lot by a mystery driver who
turned out to be Katharine wanting to say HI :-), I visited Charyl in
Clear Lake to help me get a grip on the presidential duties of our
investment club.</p>

<p>Hung out with Kristen after that; munched at La Madeline, then
drove around looking at deer at UH Clear Lake (saw an 8 point), then
visited the Kemah Boardwalk, (but stayed in the car because it was
freezing cold) and listened to all variety of Kristen-stories
throughout the night.</p>

<p>Watched choir camp videos with Kristen and Jessica, but they were
certainly more entertained by them than I.  Tired on the way home.</p>

                        <p class=date>4:09pm Saturday 29 December 2001</p>

<p>Today I rode my bike to Empire Cafe and ate a
muffin, parked my bike and visited all the shops
looking for a document chest - lots of short wide
drawers that I can use to hold paperwork, letters, etc
or whatever.  I also scoped out a few barstools to put
by the bar, but didn't find any that I liked.  (I
didn't find any document chest at all.)</p>

<p>I did, however, find an art gallery called Mixture,
which expanded my art-creation mind with some cool new
concepts for art.  One set of hangings consisted of
some 3D-ish things, some colorful, some not, and then
parafin poured over it, about a 1/4 inch thick.  Wow! 
Is this art?  It gave a supremely mystery look to the
pieces as they seemed shrouded in fog.  Cool
stuff.</p>

<p>The other wild idea was using a canvas covered in a
mosaic of hand-written letters of personal nature.  It
was just as if this artist had gone through all the
old letters s/he had received, plastered them on a
canvas and painted on that.  Amazing.  I am quite
likely to try new things than just painting acrylic on
canvas.</p>

<p><blockquote>(My first acrylic-on-canvas piece is
finished now, and I will get a picture of it on my
website someday soon.  Maybe as soon as next
year!)</blockquote></p>

<p>My next piece will be painted on a big print that
I've had for years.  Tammy and I bought it together
back in the day.  I don't know the name of the print
or the artist, but it's a scene looking over a lake
with big mountains in the background and reflecting on
the lake, and some deer chillin' by the edge of the
lake in the foreground.</p>

<p>I *was* going to just paint over the whole thing
(and give it to Wende's parents as an overdue gift (a
long time ago I said I'd paint them something that
matched their room)), but now I'm going to leave some
of the recognizable parts of this print intact and
visible beneath my acrylic.  I think it should totally
rock.  I may start on it tonight.</p>

<p>I bought two 45 rpm 7" singles at a flea market:
Olivia Newton John "Totally Hot" and Bee Gees "Stayin'
Alive," each of which I will incorporate into art in
some way.</p>

<p>I'm at KTRU, vaguely manning the board as the
basketball game is being broadcast.  This is certainly
the easiest way I know to make $35.</p>

<p>Before the game started, we were broadcasting WRN
(World Radio Network) because no DJs were available
from 4pm to 7pm apparently.  I arrived around 6:25 and
put on some music - couple of songs and then I put on
a couple of CDs at the same time:  Francis Dhomont's
<em>Frankenstein Symphony</em> and Plastikman's
<em>Consumed</em> CD and they sounded SO GREAT
together!  I let them play together for fully 25
minutes until it was time for the basketball pre game
at 6:55pm.</p>

<p>Now Rice is clobbering the other team (Sienna
Saints).  It's halftime now and they are ahead by 17,
39 to 22.</p>

<p>Still stuck at the same point on trying to figure out Custom Tags
as they work in JSP (Java Server Pages).  I called Marcel to see if he
can help with it.</p>

<p>Amazing:</p>

<p><ol><li>I got a letter from Tammy, my ex ex ex ex ex girlfriend
from high school and into college.  I had just been trying to find her
address recently, and wanted to give her some old letters that I found
when I moved.</li>

<li>I got a check for 100 bucks from Rentsmart.com for putting them
down as my apartment locator when I found my new apartment.</li>

<li>Something else, but I forgot.</li></ol></p>

<p>I'm likely to see Oceans 11 with Dude tonight.  I have absolutely
no clue what the movie is about, and I actually intend to see it with
such a totally blank mind.  I haven't done that in a while.</p>

<p>Going to Wende's now to transfer the treasurer stuff for our
investment club over to her.</p>

<p>STATE OF THE ART</p>

<p>Year of Living Geekily: Even the Dogs Evolved</p>

<p>By DAVID POGUE</p>

<p>OR observers of human nature, the end of
the year presents a golden opportunity for
spotting geeks in their native habitats.
Normal people pull tags off gifts; geeks put
batteries into them. Normal people spend the week
watching movies and reading newly unwrapped books;
geeks hook things up to the television.
Normal people make up New Year's resolutions like
"Clean the garage," "Learn French" or "Get
more exercise." Geeks pledge to "Clean up the
Web site," "Learn JavaScript" and "Get more
RAM."</p>

<p>While waiting for the computer to reboot,
we geeks may also pause to reflect on the industry
itself. For stockholders, this was the year that the
high-tech bubble burst with a definitive pop. And it
will be some time before venture capitalists back any
20-year- old with a clever PowerPoint pitch.</p>

<p>Even so, some fundamental truths still apply.
Prices continue to fall, as this season's owners of
$100 DVD players are happy to point out. Computer
power continues to climb (2-gigahertz processors),
even if many consumers already have more megahertz
than
they know what to do with. And manufacturers continue
to revise and improve their products with
disconcerting speed.</p>

<p>As evidence that the innovation engine is
still chugging along, you have but to consider this
column's topics over the last 12 months. Here is a
look at what has become of some of the year's most
notable products, updates that you can clip and paste
into your carefully archived originals.</p>

<p>NET APPLIANCES</p>

<p>Almost all the Internet appliances I
reviewed a year ago 
have
gone to that
           great Circuit City in the sky.</p>

<p>You didn't need a Ouija board to foretell
the death of 
3Com's
Audrey
           ($500). Its tiny screen could show only
part of a Web page; 
its
punctuation
           keys were mere slivers; and it offered only
a single e-mail
account for each
           machine. As for its rival, the Gateway
Connected Touch Pad
($600), you
           could have measured its Web-page download
speed in ice ages.</p>

<p>Only Compaq's IA-1 seemed to be poised for
success: it was
relatively fast,
           inexpensive and well designed. (A few
IA-1's are still 
available
at
           Walmart.com for $200.)</p>

<p>But just $600 could buy a full PC, with a
CD-ROM drive, a 
bigger
monitor
           and so on. The limited, awkward Internet
appliances simply
couldn't
           compete.</p>

<p>Only one device survives: Honeywell's
WebPad (now $1,970). 
It's a
           flat-panel touch screen that maintains a
fast, cordless link 
to
your cable or
           D.S.L. modem as you walk around the house
or office. Both 
the
price and
           the requirement for a high-speed connection
should tip you 
off
that this
           machine isn't aimed at non-techies.

           Funny, isn't it? The big companies had it
wrong. It wasn't 
the
everyday
           consumers who wanted Internet appliances.
It was the geeks.</p>

<p>DIGITAL PETS</p>

<p>Aibo the robot dog by Sony (news/quote)
was, and is, a 
remarkable
           machine. Useless, but remarkable. It can
walk on its own --
seeing
with
           cameras, hearing with microphones, thinking
with software. 
It can
even learn
           new tricks.</p>

<p>But not everyone considered Aibo a steal at
$1,500. Within
nanoseconds,
           toy companies leaped into the fray with
their own models: 
copycat
dogs that
           did less but also cost less. Eventually
Sony's engineers, no
doubt sighing with
           resignation, set about the task of
designing an Aibo 
knockoff of
their own.
</p>

<p>The result was the new Aibo LM series
($850): cuter, 
rounder,
smaller dogs
           that still respond to vocal commands and
can "learn" new
behaviors. The
           cheaper dogs cannot send audio and video to
your PC 
wirelessly,
as the
           more expensive Aibo can when equipped with
a $150 software 
kit.
But for
           anyone who longs for companionship yet
doesn't have the 
energy to
care for
           an analog dog, the price for the ultimate
laptop has dropped
considerably.</p>

<p>MAC'S NEW CORE</p>

<p>With all the hoopla about Windows XP, it is
easy to forget 
that
there is
           another good-looking, super-stable
operating system gaining
popularity:
           Apple's Mac OS X.</p>

<p>The overhaul of OS X, version 10.1,
released in September, 
was so
           sweeping that it made the original look
like a dress 
rehearsal.
The current
           version is much faster, includes a long
list of useful 
features,
and restores the
           DVD playback and CD burning that were
missing from the 
original.
</p>

<p>Even better news is that by now, most
big-name programs have 
been
revised
           to take advantage of Mac OS X's beauty and
stability, 
including
Microsoft
           (news/quote) Office, America Online,
FileMaker, Illustrator,
Freehand and
           Final Cut Pro. Mac fans should take note
that it's finally 
safe
to make the
           switch, as long as they're prepared to pay
the upgrade fees 
for
the programs
           they use.</p>

<p>THE MASTER'S VOICE</p>

<p>For all the attention given to computers
that understand 
human
speech in
           sci-fi movies, it's strange how little
fanfare surrounds 
this
category now that
           it's here.</p>

<p>In any case, both leading Windows
speech-recognition 
programs are
           available in new versions. The chief virtue
of I.B.M.'s 
ViaVoice
Release 9, a minor upgrade, is its inclusion (in
           the deluxe version) of a U.S.B. headset
microphone that 
improves
accuracy. Naturally Speaking 6,
           meanwhile, is an ambitious merger of
features from the 
onetime
rival programs L&H VoiceXPress and
           Dragon Naturally Speaking.</p>

<p>The most impressive feature of NatSpeak 6,
however, is its 
very
existence: it was born during the public
           disintegration of its maker, Lernout &
Hauspie. Only two 
weeks
ago the company sold its speech software to
           Scansoft, so that NaturallySpeaking and its
descendants may 
live
on.</p>

<p>(There is also news for Mac fans: The last
few months have 
seen
the release of both ViaVoice for Mac OS X
           and iListen for Mac OS 9.2.1.)</p>

<p>DICK TRACY'S LENS</p>

<p>Casio's weird and wonderful Wrist Camera
($230) still shows 
only
shades of gray on the watch face when
           you take pictures. But the recently
upgraded watch (model
WQV3-1BNDL) actually stores color
           photographs (80 at a time), which you can
see when you later 
beam
them, via infrared, to your PC.</p>

<p>These pictures aren't what you'd call
gargantuan -- in fact,
they're 176 by 144 pixels, just over two inches
           square. But when you need to be
surreptitious or 
spontaneous,
there's no smaller digital camera outside the
           C.I.A.</p>

<p>TUNES TO GO</p>

<p>Apple's iPod is a spectacular music player.
It holds 130 
CD's
worth of music in a
           white-acrylic-and-mirror-finish player not
much bigger than 
a box
of Tic Tacs. No MP3 player offers this
           capacity in anywhere near such a small
size, especially not 
with
12 hours of battery life.</p>

<p>But Apple said that the iPod could
synchronize its music 
library
only with Macs. Fortunately for PC fans,
           xPlay, a $40 Windows program being readied
for a January 
release,
will let you load your iPod with music
           and use it as an external hard drive for
your PC, just as on 
a
Mac. An early version is available at
           www.mediafour.com.</p>

<p>PIXELS' PROGRESS</p>

<p>The PC industry is no longer the youngster
it once was, 
exploding
with monthly leaps in sales growth and
           features. Nowadays, it's the digital camera
industry that 
behaves
that way.</p>

<p>The cameras I reviewed in 2001 are already
smaller, cheaper 
and
better. As noted last week, 2.2-megapixel
           models now sell for under $300.
Four-megapixel cameras cost 
less
than half what they did a year ago. And
           Sony's CD1000, which burns its images
directly onto 
mini-CD's,
ready for archiving or inserting into your
           computer, no longer requires $1,500 and a
wheelbarrow. 
Today,
Sony's CD200 offers about half the bulk
           and price ($800).</p>

<p>The lesson from the camera business is the
same one that 
we've
learned over and over again from the PC
           business, the VCR business and the DVD
business: The longer 
you
wait, the better the deal you'll get.</p>

<p>Of course, you know what we geeks would
say: Where's the fun 
in
that?</p>
