<p>Sweet!  It only works on PC for now, but mouseover the bubbles and the
inflate to max capacity.  Single click to pop them!</p>

<p>The mouseover calls touchBubble repeatedly via an Interval (repeatedly
calls a function every n milliseconds).  It seems that if I tell the
code inside the interval to burst the bubble, it doesn&rsquo;t have access
to the Meteor.user() value, so the user cannot get points for bursting
the bubble.  I guess this is due to threading, and I&rsquo;m going to call
it a feature (for now!)</p>

<p>Next: sound effects!</p>

<p>Lin and I are leaving soon for Mt Fuji, which we plan to begin
climbing around midnight.  We have no specific goal to reach the top
at a certain time (or really at all).. but just to climb until we
decide it&rsquo;s time to dash down the gravel scree sliding area which I
love and Lin does not.</p>

and came back home.</p>

<p>Yay!  Pop Pop Chaos now has a 7-day leaderboard.  Each user&rsquo;s points
accumulate by date, and the last 7 days are summed to make the
leaderboard scores.  This allows new players a chance to shine, and
encourages all players to keep playing!</p>

<p>Because it&rsquo;s kinda moe joe to clickclickclick so much, I might make
bubbles inflate just with mouseover, and click will create new
bubbles.  Hmm.</p>

<p class="dream">
Living inside a QT movie, therewas a spooky scene and then a couple
guys were walking along the beach with the task of digging up a dead
body.  One of them goes, "okay start digging, and the other was like
where? and then the first one fell down a bit of a cliff and revealed
her corpse, and  he goes, "right there" so they dug her out and she
was actually still alive, though animated with  spooky spirit ghost or
something and the card overlay said "Despite her looking like a nyph,
this scene is quite scary"
</p>

<p class="dream">
So while watching, I was prepared to turn it off or walk away, but it
never got scary too much.   There were two undead women teaching me how
to fight and they didn't rip my face off or anything and I was
thankful for that.  In fact, they seemed helpful and nurturing.  I
felt a bit relaxed as we had a big sparring thing and then as we
relaxed I saw a clock count down a random series of digits and then
reach the end.  I go, "what's that??" and was a bit afraid again.  One
of the women said she didn't know, and then we saw a bunch of bats
flying to surround our glass building.
</p>

<p class="dream">
Uh oh.  We coudl see them all smoofing around outside, so we turned
off the light inside but I recalled that bats could see infrared and
therefore our heat signatures.  So we turned off the light and then
could see that some of them were inside anyway, and the two girls who
had helped me sacrificed themselves to attack the bats, but it wasn't
enough as there were thousands of bats, so I tried to tattack them a
bit, but bailed due to ineffectiveness.
</p>

<p class="dream">
One of the well dressed vampire bat men with slick backed blonde hair
bit my finger with a smile as I flew in to kill him.  I realized it
was fruitless so I bailed to a new scene in which I was in San
Francisco back in the day when it was stil active Alcatraz.  We looked
out at the island, but there were lots of islands in between and I was
sure I could get out to it, or a way from it..  A three times retired
army general (served for 60 years) said he would swim out there with
me.  He jumped straight down over concrete right next to teh ocean and
sdove feet first directly down into the water just inces from the
concrete.  I saw him in the deep water, propelling himself forward
with just his feet kicking as his arms trailed back.  He made god time
and I jumped forward so as to not be so close to the concrete.  I
wasn't straight as I hit the water and so didn't go very deep into it
There were some other boats in hthe waster of some people bothering
us, and he suggested we go over to a room blocked by a grinder that
was stopped so he went past it, and then I saw him (now  little kid) on
the other side as the wheel was starting again.  He had been giving a
piece of paper to take back through the tube and I willed the grinder
to not move so he'd be okay.  Then some other people tried to come
through, starting with an old man, but I couldn't control the grinder
as it started to move so I woke up.

<p>Mai showed me a new game at the toy store today.  It&rsquo;s like sudoku in
a way; it&rsquo;s a piece-placement puzzle, given a few rules, can we fit in
all the pieces on the board?</p>

<p>It has pretty simple to explain rules; I might buy it next week to
give to Fred in January, but dang I&rsquo;ve already gotten a lot of puzzles
to give him.  How many until too many?</p>

<p>Also, it&rsquo;s 2400 yen, whereas comprable puzzles of the same brand were
2000 yen, so maybe the price will drop with time.  But still, it&rsquo;s
just a bunch of plastic, so &hellip;  dang ya know I could <em>make</em> the
puzzle except that I don&rsquo;t have all the puzzle clues themselves.  I
wonder if I can recreate enough of them to be happy with not buying
them, and I wonder if I can make the puzzle without taking too much
time.. Well yeah I can for sure; it&rsquo;s only 16 pieces.</p>

<p>consider it done! (?)</p>

<p>Now, to be clear, I haven&rsquo;t actually seen/met
<a href="https://loreatec.jp/e/">Lantz</a>, but the Internoodles assure me he can
fix iPhones in a jiffy.  I&rsquo;m just starting this optimistic journal
entry on the way there because I cannot browse cat pictures on my
phone.</p>

<h2 id="12-12-monday-14-september-2015-jst">12:12 Monday 14 September 2015 JST</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been here for 12 minutes, and the phone is essentially fixed!  He
removed the bottom screws and backplate, then swapped the broken thing
for a new thing and the phone is charging.  We&rsquo;re going to let it
charge until it boots and then call it good.  :-)</p>

<h2 id="12-17">12:17</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s good.</p>

<p>The battery isn&rsquo;t fully charged yet, but it&rsquo;s charging, and that&rsquo;s
exactly what it didn&rsquo;t do before I came.</p>

<p>Thanks, Lantz!</p>

<p>On Keihin Tohoku line now approaching Oimachi.  Will arrive in
Kawasaki in about 12 minutes, at which point I&rsquo;ll go to Wired Cafe to
drink up some addictive internet, on which I plan to email Lin that
I&rsquo;m back, and look for a guy to fix my phone.  I&rsquo;m sure it can be
fixed; just the chargin&rsquo; parts are borked.</p>

<p>And maybe I&rsquo;ll try to find a toot for integrating Soomla into a Unity
app.  They seem to have all the right parts, but not yet so flush on
examples.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re headed back to Tokyo from 式根島 (shikinejima) on a ferry that
reminds me of Topaz in that it&rsquo;s a boat with lots of passengers, all
of whom are on a boat.</p>

<p>Okay, a ship.</p>

<p>I got a handkerchief branded with the island name for Lin, and a wooden
puzzle for Fred.</p>

<p>I went to the island for two days with the contact group, featuring
four members, including the organizer, Mark.</p>

<p>I kinda wish I hadn&rsquo;t come without Lin because the island was really
nice, so I&rsquo;m definitely making plans to bring her to this island or a
similar one.</p>

<p>I had some good times on the island despite having to stick with the
group (which half the time consisted of Mark, because we were the only
ones who came on Friday).  I acted like a little shit when he peer
pressured me to not climb on rocks because he felt a sense of
responsibility for the members of the group.  He was like, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go
back to the blah blah blah because I want to check out that area,&rdquo;
whereas I did <em>not</em> want to check out any other area.  So I was like
&ldquo;fine, fuck,&rdquo; and I climbed directly up the hill instead of using the
sidewalk for normal people and I beat him to the top by about a
minute.</p>

<p>Ah, make that 15 minutes because he didn&rsquo;t notice I had ascended ages
before he did, and he went back down to the neck-breaking rock area,
yelling my name to see if I had fucking fallen into the water.  Fuck
so my sullen behaviour caused him to waste 10 minutes looking for
me. Why the fuck would I fall down the hill after I agreed to go back?</p>

<p>God I&rsquo;m terrible.</p>

<p>So we went to the next place, near some hot srpings, and he goes, &ldquo;oh
what&rsquo;s over there?&rdquo; while pointing to a concrete pier.  I was like,
&ldquo;bah who cares; it&rsquo;s man made.&rdquo; and he goes, &ldquo;I thought you were a man
of adventure!&rdquo; So I was like fine fuckit and started walking to it and
noticed there was water pouring from between some kind of walk way.</p>

<p>Hmm okay it looks interesting so we kept going, and then I realized it
was just water spilling over the pier on occasion due to wave action.</p>

<p>Thinking it would be neat to go to the end and see the waves blah blah
blah &hellip;</p>

<p>&hellip; then the next wave crested to the top by about 10 cm!  It was a
bit scary, but not enough to send me away, but then I suddenly was
like, &ldquo;oh shiz&rdquo; as the next wave knocked me over a little bit&hellip;  and
then the <em>next</em> wave had me sliding across the pier, hoping I&rsquo;d be
able to stop myself like Neo on top of the tower.</p>

<p>oh I just realized I wrote all this already.  sorry.</p>

<hr />

<p>We went to the top of a hill the first night but didn&rsquo;t see shit.  I
got into a half-asleep state and relayed information I received in
dream state, and later Mark was all yeah I&rsquo;m not going to make a
report about this night unless we get something interesting.</p>

<hr />

<p>The second night it was me, Mark, Lance, and Sumiyaki on the same
hill, but a bit lower (top of the paved area, but not to the point
where Mark and I had gone the previous night.</p>

<p>I had fallen asleep by this point, but Mark saw a ship &ldquo;power up&rdquo; and
was like, &ldquo;wow!&rdquo;  I woke up, and sure enough, I saw it too.</p>

<p>Lance, an aviation engineer said it was unlike any plane he had ever
seen before.  I could see basically a single light would turn on and
then off, as if via rheostat.  It didn&rsquo;t flash, and it wasn&rsquo;t on a
regular schedule.  It seemed to move across about 5 degrees of sky
during the time that I could see its power ups.  The whole &ldquo;show&rdquo;
lasted about 3 minutes, and then they saw maybe 3 different shooting
stars.</p>

<p>It was pretty neat, but I still think I&rsquo;ve attended more than half of
the events I&rsquo;ll attend with this group.</p>

<p>Mark and I are on an island featuring 500 permanent residents and
maybe as many tourists; I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>

<p>I wanted to climb on some rocks behind the whale statue, but he wanted
to go to the beach to check that out, so I climbed on rocks there.
Then I walked on rocks toward the onsen where there was some man made
pier which I poo-pooed as boring, but Mark wanted to check it out.  I
noticed water was flowing off it, so I thought &ldquo;hmmmm that could be
interesting!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I went to the end of the pier, and sure enough water came over the
top!  It was a bit thrilling to see the water well up from the ocean
and flood the pier about 10 cm over the top.  Wow!</p>

<p>The next wave came and &hellip; didn&rsquo;t make it over the top.  Then the next
one came and .. uh oh!  knocked me hard enough that I couldn&rsquo;t stand,
but I made it okay!  I may have gotten my phone a bit wet though.
Ooops!</p>

<p>Started to head back, and the next wave was like 50 cm over the top of
the pier!  Whoooosh I went sliding along the pier; water splooshed
over me and definitely drenched my jeans (and phone).</p>

<p>Ooops oops!</p>

<p>Fortunately, there were some curb-like things at the edge of the pier
which I planned to use to keep myself from going over the edge into
the water.   Double fortunately, I stopped sliding across the pier
before that time.  Triple fortunately, the pier was a bit slimy with
green algae or something so it didn&rsquo;t cut me up too much. Just a bit
on my left ankle and left elbow.  I tweeted &ldquo;slide, baby, slide!&rdquo; when
posting a (blurry) photo of the injuries.  Wanted a video of the
original event, though!  Might have to go back out there. Just kidding!</p>

<p>Without actually trying, the paragraph above has a perfect vertical
river near the right edge.  Check it out:</p>

<p>So anyway, fortunately my phone (and I) survived the drink, and I know
to be careful next time and put my phone somewhere safe before going
out onto that pier!</p>
