<p>Called Kim at 9am (his time) on the dot (according to <a
href="https://www.timeanddate.com/">timeanddate.com</a>) but no answer.
Called again and no answer.  Few minutes later and he asked me to call
back in 10 minutes.  Who could possibly care about such minutiae in a
journal?  Will *I* even care in 10 minutes?</p>

<p class=date>12:38am</p>

<p>Called again an no answer.  I hope he's okay; this isn't like him
normally (a year ago).</p>

Hi Kim

I called and got a busy signal, then called again and left the
message.  I feared something might be "really wrong" so I didn't want
to keep calling.   I hung out with my roommate (playing video games as
bonding) and didn't hear the email beeps on my computer so I missed
your emails.     I too was looking forward to our call.

I will call you at 9am Friday October 31st.

With Love
- Rob!

we spoke and was on another call for only five minutes
since. Otherwise, Ib12:48amve been here waiting for you since 9:15-ish
my time. Ib12:48amve got to leave now. If you still want to talk, send

My next opportunity will be Friday morning 10/31 at 9am my time.

<p>Workin' at KQ today.  Had Kyouko man to man.  She's unsure of
herself in level 5 lessons.  I'm quite sure of her, so I'm unsure of
what to teach her.  But then she didn't do amazingly well at a rather
difficult lesson so I guess there is stuff I can teach her.  I'm most
unsure of what's in her brain, what I have to work with.</p>

<p>11 more lessons until my weekend!</p>

<p class=date>6:31pm</p>

<p>8 more lessons until my weekend!  Amazing how time flies when
discussing something that's already happened.</p>

<p>Yumiko is really cute.</p>

<p>I quite quickly recognized the futility of repeating the same old
patterns.  cute - stalk - acquire - release - pain.  For one reason or
another I was blind to the pattern.  Do I see now (have I learned the
lesson), or am I just in a place of strength, feeling happy in Japan,
where engaging the pattern is clearly unfruitful?  Meh; whatever;
oughtn't analyze everything to death.</p>

<p>Speaking of meh, I wonder how Jackie is doing.  And Josephine.  And
good god there's a rally going on, actually falling to sleep right now
in little puppy piles in San Antonio.  I didn't call last night cause
I figured there'd be no one there who knew me.  Though I wonder if
Mike and Ben woulda been there, oh and Rich and Ed.  Shoulda
called.</p>

<br>i am sorry i did not let you read this to me. silly me. i need to be strong enough to hear anything you write and stay balanced.  <br>
 mostly, i am glad you are in a place of strength and can see your own behavior patterns.  that's awesome. <br>
  changing your behavior to break unhealthy patterns <br>
is even more awesome.<br>

  i believe you would see and do this on your own regardless of my presence in your life.  but if having a girlfriend back home has facilitated this selfknowledge and given you any kind of backup support, i am glad.<br>
  if i have nothing to do with this awareness and the disipline to act on it, then HMMPHHFFF! fine then. <br>

<br>Damnit Rob, I should have known better than to read your blog a few minutes before I had to go to class. How &lsquo;bout this, I&rsquo;ll try ang give a really fast run down of the rally then you can eMail me to remind me to give you more details about it and the rest of my life. Since it was a home town rally, it kind of started slow for me, but it picked up pretty well. Mike and I had planne on jumping up durring opening circle and claiming the rally back but we decided that would be too much of a distraction from the real deal (actually he decided, I was disappointed). We did social action really early which was interesting because it made the rally seem a lot further along than it was. We were working at the Food Bank and went in two shifts organized by touch group. I rode with Fred two the second shift; he&rsquo;d claimed me as his touch group leader once he found out I was going in the second shift (lazy advisors always wanting to sleep). We actually had to leave a little early though. Why? Because there was nothing left for us to do! They had no more food for us to pack! That was a good feeling. Alright, shoot, I&rsquo;m out of time. eMail me at carbon84@ and I&rsquo;ll tell you the rest (in more detail). Oh, and I have a cell phone now, it&rsquo;s 210-555-5555. And my website at <a href="https://scrivinc.sytes.net">https://scrivinc.sytes.net</a> seems to be rather stable for the time being (although I can&rsquo;t get my damn virtual hosts to work *grumble). Alright, no more, gotta go, bye!<br>

<p>Saw Kill Bill at Cinecitta tonight with Morag, Marcus, Dennis, and
Lisa after I bought the tickets before work this morning.  Liked the
movie, but not as much as Pulp Fiction.  Not as much good dialogue.
Nice variety of filmographic styles.  Lots of untranslated Japanese,
which sucked.</p>

<p>Tons of blood.</p>

<p>Wiggled tushies a bit at an outdoor music thing with trance playing
not really loudly and about 7 Japanese guys wiggling around to it.
Dennis and I found that we both like jungle better.</p>

<p>Drank OJ while they drank beers at a bar.   Learned that Dennis
(wait, is that his name?) used to be a new producer in Florida at the
24th largest television news market station in the US.  Wow.  He told
us a story about being DRUNK and losing his shirt and car with no
recollection of having driven drunkenly and parking near Disney
World.</p>

<p>Got the last trains home to Tsunashima.  Packed last train.
Squshed.</p>

<p>I didn't join them in Tsunashima at Fat Mama's bar.  Washed smoke
smell out of my clothes instead.</p>

<p class=date>9:48am JST Sunday 26 October 2003</p>

<p>I like the movie more now that I've slept on it for a night.  Good
parts keep popping up.  "oh yeah, that was pretty good / funny."</p>

<p>Lucy Liu zipping across the table in the geisha shuffle then
*shyop!*, choppin' that cat's head off.</p>

<p>XXX rubbing "BILL" off the glass with her cuff, then using her
finger to wipe off the last little bit.</p>

<p>the yakuza guys moaning all over the floor of the restaurant with
appendages cleanly removed</p>

<p>others?.... but i can't remember right now.</p>

<p>I'm hungry and tired.  I woke up at 5:30 cause I had to peeeeeee
and just stayed up to study.  (and shower).   Now it's time to go
study with Ayana.</p>

<p>But wait; I just got sidetracked: I need to try <a

sometime:</p>

<pre>

<p>I'm really glad I looked for the clearly labled FAQ on his page
before I wrote to Andrew:</p>

Hi Andrew

I keep a journal online at https://www.robnugen.com/journal, and write
my entries with emacs locally on my G4 powerbook.

I'm currently living in Japan and learning Japanese so I often want to
write hiragana / kanji with emacs, but I can't figure out a way to
make it work.  Emacs crashes if I tell OS X to write using kanji.

My workaround is to write the original file with emacs, then use
TextEdit to write the kanji and save using Shift-JIS encoding.

On my site, I tell browsers to use Shift_JIS:
&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=Shift_JIS">

Currently I'm using OS X 10.2.8 and the stock emacs that's available
from Terminal.  (GNU Emacs 21.1.1 (powerpc-apple-darwin6.0) of
2002-07-28 on law)

I'm going to upgrade to Panther soon and will download the latest
binary available at https://www.webweavertech.com/ovidiu/emacs.html
(because I don't really understand how to use CVS)

Question[s]:

1) can you type kanji in emacs?
2) what version of emacs do you use?
3) how the heck do you do it?

Thanks!
- Rob

November 24th is Matty's last day in Japan.

- - - - -

"We know you're seeing a student outside of work."

"No, I didn't see her."

"We have really good evidence you were seeing her."

"All I can say is two weeks ago she was all, 'I love you, I want to
come to London with you.  I'm going to go to London Art School.'"

"She said you were rude to her in Ebis."

"Well after she said all that how should I act around her?"

"We can sack you, or you can resign."

"I'll resign."

"Do you need time to think about it?"

"No.  Sign me up."

"Do you have anything to say?"

"Our two previous roommates have complained about a barking dog.  It
still plagues us."

"Do you have any comments for the record?"

"This is a nice pen."

"Go home."

- - - - -

To his mom:

"It genuinely feels like a weight off my shoulders.  I'm not going to
have to cut my hair."

"Here's the curse:  the guy whose room I'm living in is the only one
we know who got sacked from Nova.  And now I've followed in his
footsteps.   The night I met him, I remember he told me, 'I'm the only
guy who's gotten sacked from Nova.  Make sure it doesn't happen to
you.'"

"Literally five hours after I was told, I'm still buzzin'."

"I hope you and dad aren't pissed off at me."

"As soon as she told me, I knew I was going home.  The meeting was at
the end of my schedule and all day no one would tell me what it was
about.  They all said, 'I don't know, I don't know.'"

<p>I thought of the perfect name or the perfect thing to write in this
entry, but I forgot it.</p>

<p>Tonight after work I rode home with Morag and met her roommate Lisa
and chatted a bit and we plus one of their friends are going to see
_Kill Bill_ tomorrow night at Cinecitta.   It's the first movie I've
seen in a while here.  Nothing since... T3?  Pirates of the Carribean?</p>

<p>Morag and I studied a bit.  She correctly identified most hiragana
on my flashcards as I correctly identified most of the vocabulary.
It worked well for us, studying the same flashcards and different
levels of language awareness.</p>

<p>Really good to see that I have progressed; I can help a body learn
hiragana.  I know those answers now.  I'm practically flat reading
hiragana.  Well, I'm flat reading some of the more common sequences of
letters.  Spelling out the less common ones.</p>

<p>Yay progress!</p>

<p>I wonder if I would enjoy slash can get a job at <a
href="https://www.nhk.or.jp/englishtop/">NHK</a>, a locally broadcoasted
Japanese TV station slanted toward education.  I'm interested in it
for language learning purposes and getting away from Nova purposes.
And for something really new and different purposes.</p>

<p>Just spent 17 minutes on the phone with Rieko to figure out where
we will meet on the 29th.  Significant time was spent by our
conflicting beliefs of where we were supposed to meet (near which city
is this place), and the rest spent on my trying to comprehend her
Japanese.</p>

<p>She doesn't (seem to) speak slowly for me.  At least not all the
time.  She slows down sometimes, especially to spell things (station
names with which I am not familiar) and when I'm apparently just not
going to get it otherwise.</p>

<p>It's funny to hear her pelting me with Japanese and then using
correct grammar to translate what she said.   (report speech and all
that).  "I told you that we should meet at the front of the platform
in Yurakucho station."</p>

<p>Didn't go to Hakkejima Seaside Paradise because it rained pretty
much all day.  Did however get a call from Liz and went to a
restaurant with her.</p>

<p>Things to remember, most of which were awesome:</p>

<p><ul>
<li><p>Car navigation with various convenience store locations
projected on the map</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>When the put the car into reverse to park, the navigation
turned into a screen displaying what was behind her! Little camera on
the back of the van shows what&rsquo;s going on back there and the predicted
direction (depending on how the wheels are aligned) was projected on
the screen!!</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>When she turned the car off, the sideview mirrors folded in
automatically! (to conserve space and keep from getting
banged)</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>Nice restaurant and when we arrived, we took off our shoes at
the door (this isn&rsquo;t done everywhere in Japan).  Our shoes were the
only shoes there. (but we were not the only customers)</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>The entire restaurant had tatami flooring.  2.5 foot squares
all over the place.  Fun to pad around on that in socks</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>Liz asked the staff to ask me all the questions so I could have
practice with listening and responding to/in Japanese.  I could hear
parts of what they said, but not really enough to do more than request
a non smoking area for two.</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>Because I tried so valiantly to speak Japanese, and this was
like a training for me, they put us in our own room designed for four
people.  One table in the room and sliding paper door.  Sliding paper
windowscreen to reveal a (small!) rock garden with bamboo in
pots</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>I got to ask the waitress what she recommended,
&ldquo;isosomenandeska?&rdquo;  (I think), and I got to try some new
foods</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>We ended up with a spread of different dishes, mostly in bowls
and a couple in plates.  One of her dishes was served in a miniature
wooden chest with three ceramic drawers.  How Japanese is that??  (I
woulda taken a picture, but I didn&rsquo;t have my camera.)</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>One of my dishes was served with a fire underneath it, and
another one was served in a bamboo box, all the pieces of which came
apart for cleaning.</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>Most of the food was soft and bland, but a couple had flavor.
I&rsquo;d never had tofu as soft as this; it was like fresh
pudding.</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>I got to help her with ideas for her 14-15 year old exchange
student, telling her what to likely expect from that age.  I hope it
proves helpful.  I&rsquo;m glad I was able to offer some insights.</p></li>
