<p>Just had a lesson with Mitsuko, one of our genkiest awesome
students who can't really put sentences together correctly.  She tries
really hard and she initiates and has great followup, but it all comes
out like confetti.</p>

<p class=date>9:29pm</p>

<p>Work = finished.</p>

<p>The last lesson could have been a killer with four 7Bs, but they
were all just perfectly balanced between talkative and attentive.</p>

<p>Satoko, one of my students (previous lesson, level 5) said she
emailed me yesterday, so I'll get it on Sunday.  She talked about her
favorite music, and did pretty well with everything grammatically, so
I worked on her intonation.  Her favorite band is Mood Makers, with
Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra as a close second.</p>

<p>She said she appreciated the lesson, and preferred it to a lesson
from the book.  I was like, <b>me too; most def.</b>   I thought about
Agent Smith as I said quietly, "I <em>hate</em> this book."</p>

<p><em>Most</em> hilarious was Naomi, a 7B who is genki off the
charts.  She's so frikkin' funny with *none* of the attributes of a
typical Japanese female personality.  She saw my elephant tie and was
like, "elafat" and made elephant trunk gestures with her hand like she
was braying.  I was laughing my ass of and braying with her, hoping
I'd catch the eye of Doug in the next cubicle to see if I'd trip him
up.</p>

<p>But the most hilarious thing she said had nothing to do with
elephants.  She told me she was going to sleep or something, and I
wrote down "I sleep," with the intention of having her expand on it
later.  Then we got sidetracked with elephant gestures and when I got
back to it, I pointed to the words and was like, "I sleeep...."
expecting her to finish the sentence and she uttered the quote of the
day:</p>

<p>"I sleep on the elevator."</p>

<p>What?????</p>

<p>She is the elevator driver in Tokyo Tower, and when there are no
passengers, she often falls asleep on the elevator!  Holy shit that is
hilarious!  It's not just that *that*'s hilarious, but watching her
impersonate herself drifting to sleep, jolting awake, pretending to be
genki for the customers as she pushed the imaginary buttons...  oh god
it was a riot!</p>

<p>I noticed a similarity which tends to explain why I don't like
teaching using the Nova system.</p>

<p>Organized religions seem to me like masses of people emulating the
actions of one person, attempting to connect with their spiritual
nature.  The way one person connects with (insert your favorite name
for that which cannot be named) won't necessarily work for another.
Our personalities are different.  Our histories are different.  I
won't blather into a big blathering; here's the point:</p>

<p>The Nova way of teaching suits certain personalities of teachers
and certain personalities of students.</p>

<p>A moment ago I read the following from the suggested Kinder (4-5
year olds) lesson for the week:</p>

<pre><b>G, Coursebook Activity (Practice it!)</b> 
<br>Open one copy of the coursebook to pages 4 and 5.  Say, <em>He's
reading.  What's he doing?</em> and encourage the students to respond,
<em>He's reading.</em> Say, <em>Go!</em> and have the students point
to Dad reading on the page.  Ask, <em>What's he doing?</em> and
encourage them to respond <em>He's reading.</em> Have the students put
their hands on their heads and repeat the activity for the picture of
Lisa eating.  Repeat the activity for brushing teeth on pages 6 and 7,
watching TV on pages 10 and 11, and sleeping on pages 20 and 21.

Tip: Between each page, have the students do a different action,
putting their hands on their heads, or wiggling their fingers in the
air.
</pre>

<p>When I read the part about them putting their hands on their heads
I'm like, "wtf?" and then the Tip at the bottom is just fluff.  I
mean, of course, the author may have developed a perfect method by
which s/he can teach this stuff, but something is lost in the
explanation to me.</p>

<p>For me, teaching well requires a <em>connection</em> with the
students.  (*) I like to get in their heads; what is going on in
there?  what do I have to work with?  Ah.  Now I know how to teach
this material.</p>

<p>I can't read this paragraph and use it to teach.  The idea of
simply doing that feels so.. wrong.  Like I'm cheating or patronizing
the students... or worse, ignoring the students needs.</p>

<p>Teaching is not just actions without feeling.  The teaching occurs
on a different level than just physical action.  There's gotta be a
connection.</p>

<p>So the Nova way seems a lot like a religion to me.  Just some
lessons for people to read and try to emulate without necessarily
feeling/connecting/teaching/learning.</p>

<p>(*) There are times when I don't make this connection.  For
example, when there are four students in the room.  Or three.  Or two.
Further, my ability to teach certainly has to do with my mood at the
time.  If I'm feeling like poo, I won't likely be/appear as genki as,
say, Carla, the best kids' teacher ever.</p>

<p>Work was pretty rockin' today.  I had a best lesson ever, with two
women, one of whom recently quit her job to become an assistant
cartoonist (she creates the background of the scene for the cartoonist
who then draws the characters in it), the other of whom doesn't like
her job all that much (magazine editor) and wants to be a swimming
instructor.  So I was like, "shit dawg, go volunteer at the local pool
one hour per week this summer!"</p>

<p>I sensed her fear at that prospect, but hopefully she will do it
for herself even so.</p>

<p>The very last lesson of the day was with a level 4 in a lucky man
to man (man to man, but the student only paid for a normal lesson -
but no one else signed up (or showed up) to the lesson).  Soon as he
found out he was >M&lt; he inquired about leveling up.  I told him
what I'm supposed to say is go to the voice room, but the best way is
to save his money and go overseas to an English speaking company.</p>

<p>((According to his emails, Frank seems to give this advice all the
time.  I've been quite hesitant to so boldly tell students not to go
to Nova, but in some cases, shit - Nova just ain't helping.  And it
can't be said that I had ulterior motives; I didn't tell him to pay me
to teach him (I even poopooed my (Nova) teaching skillz) and he isn't
a finely contoured female.))</p>

<p>In the course of our conversation, he told me that he's sick of his
job so I was like, "are you married?" (no) "then go to the US" and I
gave him Philip Gayle's email address as someone in the US who knows
Japanese and might be able to help.  I should look up the email
address of the place in Houston that taught me Japanese. (I hope that
was okay to give it out; I just wrote to Philip to let him know, but
the irony is that this cat will probably contact him before my email
is sent)</p>

<p>And he told me where I could get my CDRW/DVD player fixed.  And
it's quite near KQ Kawasaki.   Rock!</p>

<p>Quote of the day:</p>

<pre>
It's good and awful.

<p>The opposite of Rar is Grar.</p>

<p>Koko didn't come to teach me today; her mom came instead.  I
understand Koko's reasons; she's working on a thesis and doesn't have
time to come chitchat with me about bullshit.  That's all fine and
good but I wish I had known so I could be mentally ready for the
change. But oh well fuckit.  I actually learned a lot more with her
mom cause her mom has been teaching for a long time now.  I must say
that *now* I am taking 3 Japanese classes.  Before it was 2 classes
and a chat.  So I've been presented a third "curriculum," a third
style of teaching, which seems more suited for little kids.</p>

<p>A car tried to run me over on the way home. (*)</p>

<p>I got my thing from Lloyd's so I can send money home.  Nick the
Lloyd's guy who helped me sign up for the service told me that the
intermediary bank in US would charge $10 for the transfer.  I'm glad
he told me cause I woulda been pissed to find out later. . . . . . So
I got my book today and there's 100 yen and 105 yen charges in it, but
maybe they aren't charges, but if they are fuckin' why didn't he tell
me about them?  Why am I so mad about stupid 205 yen?  That's pennies.
It's nothing.  I buy nearly that much orange juice each night.  In
Japan every little thing is charged.  It's annoying (I think Fred
would hate it more than me) but someone explained that's why things
*work* in Japan.  But they really don't always work; sometimes vending
machines will be out of service at the train station, etc. Sigh.  Get
over it or get mad each time.</p>

<p>I'm so contrary.  When Yahoo peeps couldn't tell me wtf a 2800 yen
charge was for I'm like meh whatever.  But this 205 yen has got me
hot. And I don't mean turned on. It's just so GRRR to me that Lloyd's
seems to have such a monopoly on sending cash home.  Maybe I will
snail mail it to janette.</p>

<p>I just ate all the cookies and now I feel a little sick.</p>

<p>(*) not really but I had the right of way.</p>

<p>ÇËÇ¶!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>I just wrote a long sad email to Kristen about wah wah wah I don't
know what I'm really doing here and then AS SOON AS my brain turned
off and I sent the message, my phone rang and it was ÇËÇ¶!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>I'll get to see her in about an hour and I'M SO
EXCITED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p class=date>11:29pm</p>

<p>I got my first full frontal hug in Japan from ÇËÇ¶.  I got my
*second* full frontal hug from ÇËÇ¶ as well.  In one day.  In one
<em>evening</em>.</p>

<p>"You miss the United States more than I thought," she said after I
mentioned for the third time in five minutes how I was looking forward
to seeing my friends again.</p>

<p>"I miss the hugs.  <em>That</em> was the first hug I've gotten
since I've been here."</p>

<p>Her eyes widened.  "Oh."</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>"I'll give you your second hug in Japan, too."</p>

<p>We sat in my room on the floor and then the futon, side by side, as
I showed her pictures in reverse chronological order of Hakone, Sakura
festival, New Year's party, Oregon, San Francisco, Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Here's something funny: I spent four days and nights at Dude and
Veronica's house in Oregon.  I have one picture of that visit.  A
picture of us eating?  no.  A picture of Dude, Veronica, and her
brother whose name I've forgotten? no.  A picture of Bailey and
Remington's butts as they look expectantly at a door?  Yes.</p>

<p>ÇËÇ¶ÇÃ English is SO much better.  Most notably her pronounciation
of R and L is vastly improved from last time I talked with her at
length.  "Lauren" sounds like "Lauren" instead of "Roland," and she
can say "Briar Forest" and something else.</p>

<p>Mostly I was just like EEEEEEEEEeeee!!!!  to have a friend in
Japan!</p>

<p>I called ÇµÇÒ to see if I could invite ÇËÇ¶ to eat with us tonight.
I was sure he'd say yes, but didn't want to surprise him.  They spoke
a lot of Japanese which ÇËÇ¶ would then translate to me.  I understood
a few words and some particles.</p>

<p>Though we had planned for me to pay for dinner tonight, ÇµÇÒ paid.
I didn't fight him on it; I've been trained otherwise by the M&M
twins.  ÇËÇ¶ tried, but was denied.  I did successfully have him not
pay a lesson fee.</p>

<p>At the end of the evening, ÇËÇ¶ walked home alone though I really
wanted to walk her home, if nothing else, to meet some more local
Japanese contacts.  I asked if I would see her again before she went
and she was like "yes" and asked if I had her number.  (yes)</p>

<p>I got my second hug and she went her own way as I walked with ÇµÇÒ
back to the station.</p>

<p>Next week we will meet in çjìá, eat at Ç›ÇŸ's, and *I* will
pay for dinner.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I forgot to say that since she has been in the US, she has forgotten some of the kanji she used to know.  And it took her a bit to get her brain back in to Japanese conversation mode when she first got back to Japan.  And she's much more outgoing than most other Japanese women.</p>

<p>Saw Matrix Reloaded again tonight.   I got to the theater a bit
late, which tends to bug me, but I'm mostly over it.  It was worth
missing a tiny bit of the movie to get a hug from Fumi.</p>

<p>So.</p>

<p>Matrix Reloaded kicked ass the second time, too.   I understood
more of the obtuse dialogue, and a couple more of the links between
scenes became apparent.  I did not however have a huge A-HA!
experience upon second viewing.</p>

<p>In a couple of scenes, I focused on slightly different parts.  Like
watching the truck's front tire instead of Morpheus and the
Key-Maker.</p>

<p>I might go see it again.</p>

<p>I'm definitely going to see more movies in Japan, and I'll probably
allow more time for getting to the theater.</p>

<p>Rar.</p>

<p>I'm blasting through obstacles like they's nuthin.</p>

<p>All my efforts are building a framework within which I can navigate
this crazy land.</p>

<p>NTT number coming soon to a phone jack near me.</p>

<p>Yahoo! BB ADSL coming soon to said NTT number.</p>

<p>IEEE 802.11b coming with it.</p>

<p><font size="-1">(that's <em>wireless</em>, baby)</font></p>

<p>Went to the bank and talked to Masahiko.  Though they were closing,
he let me in and helped me fill out the forms so my NTT bill will be
paid automagically.   Yahoo! will send me a form and I'll have him or
the peeps at Yahoo! BB table help me fill it out.</p>

<table border=1>
<tr><td valign=top><center>CHARADES</center>
<p>Without speaking, get players on your team to say the following words/phrases:</p>

<ul>
<li>sweeping</li>
<li>washing dishes</li>
<li>eating dinner</li>
</ul>
</td>

<td valign=top><center>ULTIMATE CHARADES</center>
<p>Without speaking their language, get players on the other team to
convince you, without speaking your language, they understand the
following words/phrases:</p>

<ul>
<li>Yahoo! will send you a bank draft form.  Once you receive the
form, please fill it out and take it to your bank.  This will allow
Yahoo! to electronically withdraw funds from your account.</li>
<li>Yahoo! BB is offered free of charge until the end of the first
month that begins after service has commenced.
<li>Should you choose to discontinue using Yahoo! BB after the initial
free period, please contact Yahoo! in writing within 10 days after the
end of the trial period.</li>
<li>Should you continue to use Yahoo! BB after the initial period, you
will be charged a one time 3800 yen fee by NTT for some reason that no
one can explain.</li>
</ul>
</td></tr></table>

<p>At the Yahoo! BB table, we began a game of Ultimate Charades.
Thank goodness for some random woman who offered to translate before
we got too far into the game.</p>

<p>Okay, what does this new phone number spell? 045-543-7873</p>

<p>That's

<br>JKL

<p>I'll post the winning response.</p>

<p>Another month is rolling by in Japan.  Now is the time when people
say time just flew by after the first couple of months.</p>

<p>Work was mostly good today.  Started off with a man to man that
no-showed for like 10 minutes, and then I yakked it up with some level
3s and then with some level 4s maybe.  or something like that and then
during the 10 minutes before my lesson prior to lunch, I called NTT to
find out what number to fax my gaijin card to so they can give me the
hookup on a phone number at the crib so we can get ADSL.  I figured
the conversation would last about 2 minutes, but she asked for my
address and then I was on hold and then good things started to happen
and were just wrapping up when horror of horrors the bell rang to
begin the next class.  It was like "oh damn" cause this is not a dream
the bell really *is* ringing and I really *am* late for class (in this
dream called life)</p>

<p>Fortunately, they were level 4s, but they seemed unimpressed by my
being late.  By the end of the lesson, either they faked it really
well or they were quite pleased with the results.  I focused attention
on each of them and gave them each some specific language correction
and they helped one another...  I think it turned out okay.</p>

<p>After the lesson, I'm thankful that it was Cory who told me that if
he didn't tell me to be on time to class, that he wouldn't be doing
his job.  Enough said; he knew that I knew that he knew that I knew
that he had to tell me and we both knew that we both knew I am almost
always on time to class, and later he found out that I had been
calling to get the ADSL so he was quite more interested in that than
whether I had made it to class on time.</p>

<p>During lunch Cors showed me how to use the copy/fax machine to fax
the page to NTT, and I'll call them tomorrow to make sure they got
it.</p>

<p>Walked into the voice room and no students were there.  I wrote
"antidisestablishmentarianism" on the board before a woman came in.
She was a high enough level that I could be all, "okay, this is the
topic," and help her pronounce it and explain that I didn't know what
it meant, but that it's often cited as the longest word in the English
language (or something like that).  She was the only attendee for most
of voice, so I specifically wrote her name on the board, and since she
was high level, I wrote it in hiragana, cause I don't mind (though
it's a big Nova nono) sprinkling a tidbit of Japanese in a lesson if
I'm with high level students.  Ikumi, a level 4 or so, and we were
just talking and then some other cat came in, about a low 7A.  He
seemed to do okay with the conversation, but I immediately wished
there was no hiragana on the board.  Oh well.</p>

<p>Man to man kids and then a nightmare class with two level 7Bs who
were far better than the other 7B in the class; it was just a crap
crap crap crap crap lesson.  Over.</p>

<p>Last lesson was fine; I don't really remember it except the student
was a woman, high level-ish, man to man, and she seemed happy at the
end.</p>

<p>Oh!!!  I remember she was the one from whom I got my student quote
of the day:</p>

<pre>
My company is a street light sales company.
</pre>

<p>The teacher quote of the day was from Lyle: "Fourteen is my
fortresss of solitude."</p>
