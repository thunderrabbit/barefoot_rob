                        <p class=date>4:13pm Tuesday 22 May 2001</p>

<p>I'm mostly not working right now; I just finished
reading Laura's and Hillary's journals.  I would read
other YRUUers' journals that I know, but I don't know
the URLs.</p>

<p>Like Hillary, I *!LOVE!* summer!  It's practically
freezing in my office, so I went outside and sat in my
wonderfully toasty car, which has been chillin' in the
sun all day with the windows rolled up.  I kept them
rolled up and just relaxed in the near sauna
temperature.  So great!  And I didn't even sweat.  I
drink between .5 and 1.5 gallons of water each day,
and my body knows not to sweat when I'm chillin' in my
saunamobile.</p>

<p>But the *point* is that I feel all ookie icky
cooped up in front of the stupid computer all day! 
Maybe I should start taking a unicycle break each day
again.  I can't today because I took the uni out of
the trunk so I could take a pile of recycling to the
recycling place, which is pretty close to my work. 
While I was there, a woman saw that I was recycling a
YELLOW PAGES NATIONWIDE EDITION.  It's not the Yellow
Pages, but some company that has printed an listing of
internet companies on the web, including MR
Laboratories (when it existed) (without my permission)
and tried to charge me $ for the luxury.  Pshh. 
right.</p>

<p>So I gave her the phone book and her male companion
(husband, brother, who knows) was all "yeah, we left
Missouri City and moved to Michigan, and we got rid of
all our phone books, and when we got to Michigan, we
only had a itty bitty real thin phone book.  When we
came back to Missouri City, we didn't have a phone
books, but my brother, luckily for that, delivers the
phone book and he got us a copy of it and now we have
a stack about this tall, and the way I see it, if
you're gettin' rid of it, I'll take it, so now we'll
have a nationwide edition of the phone book too."</p>

<p>I was all, "wow."</p>

<p>And now I'm all, how could you possibly think it's
a nationwide phone book if the phone book for Michigan
is this thin, and the phone book just for Houston is
three times thicker than this alleged nationwide
directory???  Does this nationwide directory omit
Houston?  Omit all big cities?  Or is it just a load
of crap?  Maybe that's it.  Yes.  And that's why I got
rid of it, and hope you enjoy it.</p>

<p>I certainly was much more charming than that while
I was listening to his story of properly determining
that his uncle's refrigerator needed a new
thermometer, but his uncle hired a contractor anyway,
who determined it was the thermometer and charged him
two hundred dollars to fix it, when he could have just
gotten a new thermometer for about thirty or fifty
dollars at the most and just been charged five or ten
dollars to put it in because a contractor is out to
make money, but a repairman is just out to make a
living.</p>

<p>It's 4:30pm now; maybe I can walk around our suite
for a second and psych myself up to actually work on
my project.  Right after I check my email again for
the fiftieth time today.</p>

                        <p class=date>11am Tuesday 22 May 2001</p>

<p>Had fun in our first Spanish III class last night,
and there's a woman there who is so so cute!  She
smiled toward me a few times (I think (hope?)) and
when we all went to the cafe thing for our break, I
was careful to say Wende and I are engaged, and I
rubbed Wende's back a bit while she sat next to
me.</p>

<p>At the beginning of class, we paired up and
interviewed our partners in espa単ol, then introduced
our new friend to the group.  I paired up with Maria
and presented a few interesting things about her.</p>

<p>When it was my turn to be interviewed, she was
aking stuff about me "why no shoes?" "where do you
live?" etc.  Our instructor said, "tell her about one
of your adventures."</p>

<p>Cuando tengo cinco a単os, mis padres me da a los
elefantes.  Vive con los elefantes todo vida.  Los
elefantes comen cachuates, y yo come uvas.</p>

<p>Un dia, cuando tengo cartorse a単os, fui con un mono
en un camionetta a la tienda.  Compre cereal, leche, y
hielo for la leche.  El mono manejo la camionetta a
regresar.</p>

<p>Hizimos un nueva bebida con los uvas, la leche, el
hielo, y el cereal, con los pies de los elefantes. 
Vendimos las bebidas, y mucha gente les gustan las
bebidas.  Gani mucho dinero, y dani el dinero a los
ni単os pobres, por que soy un angel.</p>

<p>I know there are a lot of verb screwups in the
story, but basically it says I was raised by
elephants.  They ate peanuts and I ate grapes. One day
I drove to the store with a monkey.  We purchased
cereal, milk and ice.  The monkey drove back.  We made
a new drink with grapes, milk, ice, and cereal, with
the elephants' feet.  We sold the drink and people
really liked it.  I got a lot of money and gave it to
the poor children because I am an angel.</p>

<p>At the end of the night, I rode the elevator down
with Wende and Gabriella (that's her spanish name; I
think her real name is Rachel) as we talked about
class.  When Wende and I got to her truck, Wende was
all, "what are you going to do when Evita comes back
and you'll have two girlfriends in Spanish??? (*)</p>

<p>"What?"  I played.</p>

<p>"There's only two girls who you will ride down the
elevator for."</p>

<p>She tagged me there.  Yup.  Usually I run down the
stairs and meet (or beat) them at the bottom.</p>

<p>"Um,... I'm not sure," I admitted.  "I might break
up with Evita."</p>

<p>(*) Three counting Wende, but Wende doesn't count
because she is my one and only real girlfriend.</p>

<p>I woke up around 7:30, and I don't really know what
time we need to leave, or if I will get a wake-up
knock from someone.  I don't want to go down to their
room to wake them up; they certainly know the schedule
and have alarm clocks and such.</p>

<p>I've decided I would like to join them for
breakfast, but then go home instead of attend Monica's
graduation.</p>

<p class=date>10:07 am</p>

<p>Breakfast was just me and Kiera and we talked about
her planned book called 'Coming Out' with a format
very similar to my Rob's Rollercoaster Roundup:  A big
picture filling one side and then the other page with
that person's coming out story!  Brilliant!  All ages,
races, backgrounds represented.  So awesome!</p>

<p>Hugs and hugs and bye bye to everyone as they
loaded up to go see Monica's graduation.  I just got
breakfast for Scott and I'm heading home now.</p>

<p>I'm so thankful for such a wonderful incredibly
great time meeting Kiera!!</p>

<p>Driving and typing.  En route to 
Austin to see Kiera!  Wonder if I will stay with her
family in the hotel or if I will say with Rodd and
Stacy.  Part of me thinks (and all of me definitely
hopes) that I will stay with Kiera in her own room so
we can stay up all night talking.</p>

<p>The reason I even think there could be a chance of
her having her own room is that her dad said her room
number was different than their family hotel room
number.  And he was quite friendly and aware I was
coming out and all that.  Super great!  They might
have gotten her a room specifically for me to come
visit!!</p>

<p>I'm pretty much on speedy higway now, though I
don't really have a sense of how many more hours it is
and if I'm basically on time.  I think I'll be here 
by 7:30 or less.</p>

<p>How ironic that Sally is leaving Austin to go see
her brother (?)  graduate in.. Massachusettes, where
Kiera is from.!!!!</p>

<p class=date>6:19 pm</p>

<p>I'm 40 miles from Austin now and I just got a call
from Wende who said that the whole gang was over at
our house and Meredith was about to open the present
of the salad bowl I painted for her for Christmas last
year.  Actually I painted it this year, but it was her
present that was <em>really</em> from me instead of
the ones  that Wende bought for Meredith for me..  I
admitted  to Meredith that I played a very small  part
in the present-getting for her because I didn't really
know what to get her.  The bowl was a gift in make up
for not getting her the original gift.  Still of
course, it was painted with great love and care
specifially for Meredith.</p>

<p class=date>8:02 pm </p>

<p>So great!  Kiera is awesome, her kids are way cute
and talkative!  So much to say!!  Kiera had some
mexican take-out for dinner and, bless her heart,
thinks I drove 'all that way', when really, it was
just three hours!</p>

<p>We are about to go swimming now.  Yay!!!</p>

<p class=date>1:07 am 19 May 2001</p>

<p>We (Kiera, her sister Monica, Monica's friend
Tanya) visited Empanada's and watched Grupo
Fantasma...  When I saw their instruments, I pegged
them for Jazz / Blues / Rock combo..  However, they
had a much more Cuban / Latin sound and even  bit of
ska sound with upbeat and horns.</p>

<p>I was all sleepy tired while we were sitting
waiting for the band to come on, but I woke up dancey
dancey when they started..  We only stayed for about 4
or 5 songs, thought they were long songs and vacated
around 12:45am</p>

<p class=date>2:00 am</p>

<p>I get my own room tonight!  Wow!  Actually I'm in
John's (Kiera's brother) room; he is sleeping on the
futon in their parent's room.</p>

<p>I will pprobably choose to join them for breakfast,
but skip the graduation and just drive straight
home.</p>

<p>I'm so excited!  Today I get to meet Kiera, my pen
pal of 14 years... and we've never previously met! 
Truth is that we wrote letters back and forth pretty
consistently for about 4 or 5 years, and then we
mostly fell out of touch during my college days and
the past few years.</p>

<p>But(!), when I went through all my old school
letters (oh my gosh I should bring hers!!!), I found
Kiera's address and wrote her a postcard.  Her parents
were still at that address and she got it!</p>

<p>AND(!) she is in Austin to see her sister graduate
tomorrow, so I'm going out there to see her
tonight!</p>

<p>My excitement level just got boosted because I
actually called her dad and learned the hotel room
numbers they're in and all that.  I'm hoping to be out
there by 7pm.  Yay!!</p>

<p>We now are back online!!  yay!!!!!  At home I mean!  With cable
modem, so it's pretty speedy.  I haven't seen it be ridiculously fast,
but it's pretty darn fast.  At leat as fast as DSL was.  I'm happy
with that.</p>

<p>Turns out the reason it seemed not so fast is they were having problem with the service.  It's pretty fast now.</p>

<p>Yay internet access!!</p>

<p>I'm being lazy and cutting and pasting part of what
I wrote to Sally in an email into my journal.  Good
random stuff.  In two languages.</p>

<p>Aprendando espa単ol es bien, pero no estudio muy
mucho. Estudio a veces.  (Is aprender "to learn"?  Is
aprendando "learning"?  Can I say "learning spanish is
good" that way?)</p>

<p>Ayer, hablo con mi viejo amigo Francisco, quien
hable espa単ol all his life (todo 辿l life ? (todo 辿l
viv-something?)).  Dice que tengo que aprender uno
palabra cada dia.  Hablando con amigos en espa単ol es
muy fun, y Luz Clarita (Wende's name en clase de
espa単ol) y yo might comemos con Dude y Veronica, y
hablamos en espa単ol.</p>

<p>I'm guessing the sentence structure at the end of
my
paragraph is incorrect.  Am I trying to use the future
imperfect?  I have no idea what is the name of the
type of speech I'm trying to write.  I know we haven't
learned it yet.</p>

<p>Dude and Veronica saben espa単ol muy bien, y son
even
mas buenos amigos que Francisco.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Wende and I got our internet access re-established
after 4 weeks of no access at home!  Today we had
cable modem connected, and it's a pretty refreshing
thing to have back.  And, as a side benefit, I can
watch The Simpsons and Futurama on Fox with a clear
picture now.</p>

<p>The guy had to give me a cable splitter though; we
were not listed to get TV access when he hooked up our
cable internet access.  And, I still have to actually
terminate the ends of the cables to hook up the TV. 
The splitter is a great start though.  :-)</p>

<p>Yesterday Jennifer from the pottery place called me
and asked if we could meet so she could talk.  I'm
glad that I was able to find time to hang out with her
tonight.... at Amy's Ice Cream(!!)</p>

<p>She described the situation as she saw it.  She has
done the best presentation she can, but now has to
wait 2 weeks to find out what they think.  Did she
pass?  Will she win?  She's decided her life will have
markedly different paths depending on what they say. 
It's an interesting situation in which she has placed
herself.</p>

<p>I offered some different viewpoints and options as
best I could, and offered that no matter what, I'm
still her friend and I still love her.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>As I arrived home, she called me saying that her
car stalled out at Whole Foods.  I suggested that she
ask some of their peeps there; they're pretty
friendly.</p>

<p>I just called her to see how her car fared, and
it's all good; she called her dad... and here's the
good part: she got good (not yet confirmed) news from
him about the outcome that will be revealed after 14
more days.  yay!!  I love synchronicities!</p>
