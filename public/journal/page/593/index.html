<p class=date>9:56pm CDT Wednesday 3 October 2000</p>

<p><p>We developed a new game during ultimate tonight.  For a few weeks,
for some unknown reason, people have yelled &ldquo;DOMINATE!!&rdquo; at/to Andy
when he makes a good play in the endzone - either defensively or
offensively.  The cheer was used for other players, and tonight, took
a whole new level of fun.</p>

<p><p>Someone, for some unknown reason, yelled &ldquo;ALIENATE!!&rdquo; or some other
nice 3 syllable word that rhymed.  The -ATE words began to randomly
fill the otherwise quiet night.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;CONFISCATE!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;MEDITATE!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;PENETRATE!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;ADMINISTRATE!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;RADIATE!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;EXASPERATE!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;UP TOO LATE!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;GYRATE!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Minus one, that&rsquo;s not enough syllables.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;UNDULATE!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;ALLEVIATE!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;CONSTIPATE!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Sean: &ldquo;alright; I&rsquo;ll say it, MASTURBATE!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;ADMINISTRATE&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;PENETRATE!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a repeat!  minus one.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;ENUNCIATE!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;INFILTRATE!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;DIFFERENTIATE!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Me: &ldquo;EIGHT!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Later, Mark yelled &ldquo;ATE!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Me: &ldquo;Minus one! I already said that.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Mark: &ldquo;How did you spell it?  A-T-E?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Nope; I yelled E-I-G-H-T.  Good job.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>The game continued in this silly manner for the remainder of the
night.  When Sean left, people yelled &ldquo;LATE!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m bummed that I didn&rsquo;t think to yell</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;ULTIMATE!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>(with the long A sound of course)</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was in the shower and I washed down the drain a bunch of Wende&rsquo;s hair.  I lifted the drain cover to make sure it didn&rsquo;t get stuck and I could see a sea sewage, including lots of cigarette butts and stinky stinky stuff.</p>

<p><p>I don&rsquo;t know what a swarm of killer bees sounds like, but I can
hear the whining drone of the Grand Prix cars racing around a track in
downtown Hosuton this morning.  In the three years that they&rsquo;ve been
here, I&rsquo;ve never watched them race.  I&rsquo;ve skated on the track (not
during the race) and I&rsquo;ve even skate up and down some of the stands
(bleachers).  But never have seen them race.</p>

<p><p>I even tried to buy tickets last year (for Kristen and I), but my
bank account was overdrawn.  (I didn&rsquo;t realize this until I got to the
ticket booth.)  I took that as a sign to not buy tickets.</p>

                        <p><title>Midnight KTRU Bocce</title></p>

<p><p class=date>1:45am CDT Saturday 30 September 2000</p>

<p><p>For the past two years, the KTRU midnight event has been midnight
croquet.  This night we had to option of playing croquet with the time
honored and time worn croquet sets, or to play bocce with glow in the
dark bocce balls.</p>

<p><p>The bocce balls didn&rsquo;t exactly glow in the dark; they had little
lights inside so they shone in the dark!  Even better than glowing.</p>

<p><p>The croquet sets were hardly touched once the bocce balls were
illuminated.  The tosses were short at first, but then we made a bocce
trek around the field, tossing the blinking bocce ball and tossing the
others after it.  Random people won each round.  Score was not kept.</p>

<p><p>The coolest two throws were by Ben.  He threw a red bocce ball and it
turned off when it landed.  We were all, &ldquo;uh oh- I hope we can find
it!&rdquo;  Then he threw the second red bocce ball.  As it rolled, it hit
the first one and turned it back on!  Magic!!  I loved that!</p>

<p><p>During our trek around the field, I tossed one of the green bocce
balls and it broke when it landed.  Most of the shell was found (with
lights still inside) and 1 battery was found.  But we never found the
rest.  Maybe tomorrow.  Probably not.  We joked about all meeting back
at 6am to look for it.</p>

<p><p>After our trek, we arrived back at the couch and table and ate ice
cream and chilled for 30 minutes or so.  Talked about random KTRU
stuff, including how the Rice Administration has created a Committee
to see if KTRU is doing what the Administration wants KTRU to do.
They might try to change KTRU programming, which they are fully
legally capable of doing; they pay for it all.  And KTRU certainly
doesn&rsquo;t make money for the campus.</p>

<p><p>We talked about KTRU prizes and how few calls we get when we offer
prizes up for grabs.  Justin said, &ldquo;I announced &lsquo;I have Beastie Boys
tickets, so call in if you want them.&rsquo;  Then 20 minutes later, &lsquo;I
really do have Beastie Boys tickets&rsquo;&rdquo;  That was several years ago.</p>

<p class=date>10:46pm CDT Saturday 30 September 2000</p>

<p><p>Maggie and Molly arrived just as I finished the last entry.  I
showed them inside and we talked and giggled a bit.  Wende was still
taking a shower so we went in to say HI to her.  For some silly
reason, the twins walked in backwards to protect any bit of modesty
Wende might have.</p>

<p><p>I actually fell asleep while we listened CDs downstairs.  I gave
Maggie at Tom Tom Club CD and she played some of it.  I lay on the
living room floor and just zonked out.</p>

<p><p>Once Wende was ready, we drove to Carraba&rsquo;s and met Eric and
Meredith there.  Food and conversation dominated by Meredith from
weddings to diets.  They showed us their lovely wedding photo albums.</p>

<p><p>After dinner as we stood outside, I had an urge to grab Meredith to
sit in my lap, but I grabbed Wende instead.  Good call, Rob.  We
talked and talked then went back home.</p>

<p><p>Eric and Meredith went wherever they went; Maggie and Molly hung
out with Wende and me after eating ice cream here at our house.  We
all talked for almost two hours.  So much fun.  They have just left
and now it&rsquo;s bedtime.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Circus animals were being kept alive at a landfill by
feeding them food that was being thrown away.  All the animals were
tied up in a row - elephant, lions, giraffe, zebra, horses.. and they
had been there for a year, living off the garbage that people were
throwing away.</p>

<p><p class=dream>The landfill pile had been growing for many years
previous, but the maintainers quit accepting plastic bottles and
refrigerators.  Ever since then, the landfill has decomposed itself at
a rate equal to how much was being thrown away.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Sean from ultimate was out there and he simply wondered
why we hadn&rsquo;t played frisbee yet today.  (cameo appearance in the
dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>Then we were in a record shop, looking for little
trinkets to purchase for some reason.</p>

<p class=date>4:08pm CDT Saturday 30 September 2000</p>

<p><p>Today Wende and I spent significant time together clearing out my
study.  We threw away a garbage bag worth of stuff and moved out
another significant pile of stuff.  Now I should more easily be able
to write letters (snail mail!) and work on other fun projects (paper
clock that Wende got me for Christmas 1996) and archiving photos.</p>

<p><p>Back several years ago, I wanted to archive photos in such a way
that I could produce the negative of any photo in case someone wanted
a copy of it.  Now I&rsquo;m thinking throw away the negatives and just put
all the photos in a photo album and label them.  It&rsquo;ll take multiple
photo albums and will take a pretty long time to archive them well,
but I trust that I&rsquo;ll be way pleased with the results when the albums
are complete.</p>

<p><p>Super duper special crazy thanks to Wende for all her help and
support!</p>

<p><p class=dream>She shook her head no.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Do you want to talk?</p>

<p><p class=dream>She didn&rsquo;t really respond.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I washed my hands in the other sink, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a good
listener.  If you want to talk &ldquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>She started talking, expressing with sadness her
current situation and a bunch of people got out of class so it started
getting crowded.  We went to a quiet lounge and someone immediately
came in and turned on the wide screen TV.  We walked over somewhere
else and were now in the hallway of some dorm rooms.  We sat in a sofa
near one of the rooms.  The room we were near had its door open and we
ended up inside that room talking on the couch in there.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I listened to her whole situation, and then thought for
a moment.  I was considering between two alternative healing solutions
and decided to let her choose between them. (*) I think one is the
better solution, but tried to present both with a bias-neutral tone.</p>

<p><p class=dream>&ldquo;One school of thought is that it&rsquo;s beneficial to reach
back into our minds and find an older sadness.  The sadness or pain we
are experiencing now is actually a result of the situation that
happened a long time ago, when the sadness was not expressed.</p>

<p><p class=dream>A different school of thought is to choose to make a
change in one&rsquo;s life now.  To take action right now that would make
one&rsquo;s life better.</p>

<p><p class=dream>As I presented the second option, the residents of the
room arrived.  We introduced ourselves.  I&rsquo;m Rob, and this is Jennifer
(it was Jennifer, Molly&rsquo;s roomate Sabita&rsquo;s friend who I met in 1993 or
so.)</p>

<p><p class=dream>Their room was really awesome.  The centerpiece on the
floor was a large circular ball track thing where the solid black and
chrome balls spiraled down and struck one another to make the next
ball move.  Lights and beads hanging from the ceiling made a partition
to the bed-side of the room.  Colored lights bathed a colorful glow
over everything.</p>

<p><p class=dream>The actual resident handed a camera to his friend.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your turn to photograph the ball thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>&ldquo;Does it ever do anything unusual?&rdquo;  I asked.</p>

<p><p class=dream>&ldquo;No, but just in case.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>One of the residents sat beside me on the couch.  He
inquired about me and I described that I had been a student at UH and
was in the band and rifle corps and woodworking, &ldquo;and something else I
think but I don&rsquo;t remember (!),&rdquo; and now I was at Rice University (#)
seeking another computer science degree because school is so much fun
for me.</p>

<p><p class=dream>They thought that logic seemed pretty sound.  I told
them I don&rsquo;t actually live in the dorms, but we needed a quiet place
to sit, and I have learned that a dorm room with a door open means
&ldquo;come in.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; they mused.  &ldquo;Hey, do you happen to have a van?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>&ldquo;Not anymore, I have a Toyota Camry.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>&ldquo;We need someone to move our ball thing.&rdquo;  The ball
thing in the middle of the room was about 5 feet in diameter and 5
feet tall.  Balls were about 5 or 6 inches in diameter.  As I talked
to the guy, they apparently started moving it, because I looked back
and the center column had been removed.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Their resident advisor came in and stood behind the
desk; it was his office.  He was doing office stuff as we were all
leaving.  I never got a response back from Jennifer, but she had said
at one point that she felt a lot better.</p>

<p><p>(*) The first option is what I believe.  The second one Maggie
believes so passionately that I imagine it must be valuble in some
situations.</p>

<p><p>(!) Those activities are from my days in high school, not at UH.</p>

<p><p>(#) This is the second dream recently with me back in college or
grad school.</p>

<p class=date>11:05pm CDT Friday 29 September 2000</p>

<p><p>This evening, after a pretty productive day at work, I watched
<em>The Matrix</em> on video, which Wende purchased for me.  <em>The
Matrix</em> is my second favorite movie of all time.  <em>Pulp
Fiction</em> is still number one.</p>

<p><p>Tonight at 11:45pm KTRU DJs are invited to midnight bocce with
glow-in-the-dark bocce balls.  Yay!  If I&rsquo;m not too exhausted, I&rsquo;ll
write about it when I get back.</p>

<p class=date>10:16pm CDT Thursday 28 September 2000</p>

<p><p>This morning at work I completed a few items from my email inbox
and was just about to continue design on the Ritz project when I
noticed Karla&rsquo;s energy was all wacked.  I inquired and she basically
said Dave needed support with his project (which was all wacked).  I
therefore spent many hours today helping fix some things with Dave&rsquo;s
project.  Basically there were some errors in the beginning that
&ldquo;snowballed&rdquo; into bigger problems.  I think they are all solved now.</p>

<p><p>I felt all smart and stuff and then we discovered that a different
problem was due to a bug in my code.  The bug has been propogated
through 4 projects that all use the same code.  They never showed up
until Dave&rsquo;s project because the data covered its own butt.  It only
showed up when there were two errors in the data. (*) Error correcting
data?  Kinda, but not really.</p>

<p><p class=date>10:55 pm</p>

<p><p>It took 30 minutes to recognize it was a bug, 20 minutes to
recreate the error in some different code, 15 minutes to figure out
why the error didn&rsquo;t manifest itself in other projects.  25 minutes to
fix the error, test the new code and move it online.</p>

<p><p>(*) Wende just arrived with dinner from Taco Bell.</p>
