<p>Been working on sorting through several years of pictures, not sure
how to organize them.  My best idea (and probably the one I'll go
with) is to sort them by subject: YRUU, our gang, KTRU, skating,
ultimate, construction, etc.  Oh, these are physical pictures and not
image files online, so they are a bit dusty and I've been sneezing a
lot.  Pooh.</p>

<p>I've found some fantastic memories in my mind while looking through
these.  Some pics I'm going to snail mail to some of my peeps.</p>

<p>I've got my music library set to random on my computer here,
keeping my ears entertained while I sort through pics.</p>

<p>I took an antihistmine about an hour ago, and now I seem to be
falling asleep.</p>

<p>Today Marta and I went to Plano church for their Water Communion,
which is Marta's favorite.  Outside the church was a bouncy castle
thing and water balloons and hoses for the kids to have their own
water communion.</p>

<p>Got to see Maia, who is super close to graduating from UTD
(University of Texas at Dallas) with a BA in Sociology.  She just got
a new home in an apartment complex, a condo actually, with a cool
roommate who cooks and does dishes.</p>

<p>Now we're going to go chow all-we-can-eat sushi.</p>

<p>YRUU was fun today.  We played Detective (a person leaves the room;
they are the detective.  In the room a person is chosen to be the gang
leader.  Everyone in the room mimics the gang leader to cover up
his/her actions.  Detective tries to figure out who it is) and then
Teapot (a person leaves the room and the group chooses a verb to
replace with "teapot" or variants thereof.  Person comes back and asks
questions about "teapotting" to figure out what the verb is) and then
we played a story game a la Joana (two people are instructed that they
will leave the room and we will come up with a story.  They come back
and ask yes/no questions about the story.  When they leave, the room
chooses a pattern to answer yes/no to the questions.  We chose "yes"
for all questions that end in a consonant, and "no" for all questions
that end with a vowel, and "maybe" for questions that end in 'h' or
'y').  Super excellent time had by all, especially the group
tormenting Simon and Mike with the story game.</p>

<p>Today is Marta's 10,000th day!  I'm quite pleased to help her
celebrate; she's the first person who has embraced my idea of
celebrating days instead of
years *and* turned 10,000 days old.</p>

<p>We're driving to Dallas now to a comedy club thing and then a lot
of her friends are going to sleep at Jenae's house tonight.</p>

<p class=date>9:01pm</p>

<p>Most people have just met each other here at the restaurant.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>At the restaurant we were all dancing and drumming at the table.
Marta got her meal served on her 10,000 days old plate from Paint
This!</p>

<p>Dinner over; fun with Rachel being loud beside me and music even
louder behind me.  Marta and Katy (sp) up on stage together with the
musicians playing salsa, and Marta on her lap now, actually.  And the
three of us signing (ASL) back and forth, except Katy knows a
different variant of sign or something. (turns out that she taught
herself sign)</p>

<p>oh and police videos on TV.  Cop: "I'll give you a warning if you
drive me to the station; I locked my keys in the car."</p>

<p>Rachel is funny.</p>

<p>And then a guy from the band pulled me on stage with a random
person from a different table.  We had tambourines and a good ol'
time.</p>

<p class=date>12:26am</p>

<p>Wow. <a href="https://www.ad-libs.com">Ad-libs</a> was completely
amazing.  I'm way impressed with their skillz in making shit up and
retaining information.  Singing was pretty good and funny, though they
didn't have to memorize what they had sung - it was more just go along
with the story line.</p>

<p>The Forward Reverse skit about a bear was quite impressive.  They
ad libbed a story featuring a bear, and the other team got to yell
"forward!" or "reverse!" at random times and make the actors rewind or
play the scene.  So amazing that they were just winging the scene and
<em>memorizing</em> it so they could play it backwards and forwards at
any moment.</p>

<p>"Hey there, Bobby, are you enjoying camping?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I'm having a really good time."</p>

<p>"Why don't you come sit next to me at the fire?"</p>

<p>"Okay."</p>

<p class=message>"Reverse!"</p>

<p>"Okay."</p>

<p>"Why don't you come sit next to me at the fire?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I'm having a really good time."</p>

<p class=message>"Forward!"</p>

<p>"Why don't you come sit next to me at the fire?"</p>

<p>"Okay."</p>

<p>"Are you going for a merit badge?"</p>

<p>"I'm working on getting my Weeblo badge."</p>

<p>"A we blow badge?  Oh, I think you'll get a merit badge this
weekend..."</p>

<p class=message>"Forward!"</p>

<p>"Why don't you come sit next to me at the fire?"</p>

<p>"Okay."</p>

<p>"Are you going for a merit badge?"</p>

<p>"I'm working on getting my Weeblo badge."</p>

<p>"A we blow badge?  Oh, I think you'll get a merit badge this
weekend..."</p>

<p>"Yeah, I'm going to get my Weeblo Badge, Cub Scout Badge, Boy Scout
Badge, Eagle Scout Badge."</p>

<p>"Would you like a Coca-Cola?"</p>

<p>"I love Coca-Cola!  Are we allowed to drink soft drinks on a
camping trip?"</p>

<p class=message>"Reverse!"</p>

<p>"Are we allowed to drink soft drinks on a camping trip? I love
Coca-Cola!"</p>

<p>"Would you like a Coca-Cola?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I'm going to get my Weeblo Badge, Cub Scout Badge, Boy Scout
Badge, Eagle Scout Badge."</p>

<p>"Would you like a Coca-Cola?"</p>

<p>"I love Coca-Cola!  Are we allowed to drink soft drinks on a

<p>Next guy walks in, "I'm ready!"</p>

<p>"Ready for what?"</p>

<p>"Ready to kill!"</p>

<p class=message>"Reverse!"</p>

<p>"Ready to kill!"</p>

<p>"Ready for what?"</p>

<p>"I'm ready!"  Next guy walks backwards offstage.</p>

<p class=message>"Forward!"</p>

<p>Next guy walks in, "I'm ready!"</p>

<p>"Ready for what?"</p>

<p>"Ready to kill!"</p>

<p>"I don't think we're allowed to hunt on this camping trip."</p>

<p>"Whatchoo gonna kill?"</p>

<p>"Anything that mooves!"</p>

<p>"Yeah!"</p>

<p>"I don't approve of killing animals"</p>

<p>Bear rolled forward onstage and jumps onto camper's back,

<p>For the game What Are You Doing, They used my suggestion of light
bulb for "screwing in a light bulb" and then the moderator stopped it,
thinking they wouldn't be able to come up with more stuff.  Also my
suggestion of Space Travel and my initials R N for what are you doing,
like, "Rocketing to Neptune" etc, but the others were all about 6
words long instead of 2.  Then letters F and J were used to "Fax
Jesus" and "Just Fondling" and "Feeling Jewish" Great sometimes crude
stuff.</p>

<p>When they did a story as different characters, the characters were
a Jazz man, a gigilo, girl scout, and Thunder Rabbit!  The story was
called 7-11 Wedding, and it was relatively funny, but not amazing.</p>

<p>Marta got to go up on stage since it was her 10,000th day and be a
fourth head in Mr Know-it-all.  She lost the team 2 points by harshing
on Dubbya.  "Why is Dubbya so dumb?"  "Dubbya" "is" "so" "dumb"
"because" "he's "republican" finished Marta to a loud chorus of boos
from the audience.  On the apology from the team it went "We're"
"sorry" "not" said Marta.  2 points lost.</p>

<p>Points don't seem to be really important actually, so whatever.</p>

<p>The game of Freeze was *really* funny.  Scene with two guys holding
one guy on either side of him like he was in a chair, and then a guy
froze them and stood in front, kinda laying back on the guy in the
chair, "The new Easy Matic easy chair will let me lean back," using a
remote control to move the chair back and forth.  Then he clapped
twice and the sound a light guy turned off the lights and back on when
he clapped twice again.</p>

<p>Same scene got frozen and the guy who froze replaced the guy being
held up.  He started the dialogue, "These stadium seating toilets are
pretty cool!"  and in the same position frozen again, "Truth by Calvin
Klein" and all the guys started caressing each other's faces.</p>

<p>Same scene got frozen, and the guy got in front, "Okay, Goose, I'm
gonna slam on the brakes and they'll fly right by us!"  Yes!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>There was other funny stuff, too.</p>

<p class=date>12:51am</p>

<p>When we left the club Jenae and Cris had already split, so Marta
and I couldn't stay at Jenae's (parent's) house tonight since Marta
has never been there before, doesn't know where it is.  So we're going
to sleep at Marta's house tonight.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Random stuff from the show:</p>

<p>"We need an unusual noun"</p>

<p>"Hose!"</p>

<p>"Hose!  Oh, wait, is that plural as in ho's?"</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>"Horror, that's horr or, not whore"</p>

<p>Marta and I are up to watch cartoons on her 10000th day!  But they

<p>I checked my messages and Wende said that some skate guy called me
inviting me to skate.  I checked the message and it was from Scott,
from whom I borrowed the unicycle!!!  Wow!!!!  Hooray!  I'm so
thankful to get back in touch with him so I can give his unicycle
back.  So great great great!!</p>

<p>I called him and gave him an update on my life and got his phone
number and address.  I'll put them somewhere safe...  Somewhere that
I'll never lose it again.  Maybe on this scrap of paper here.  Yeah,
that's the ticket.</p>

<p>I've started a new big project: organizing 15 years worth of
un-organized pictures from pre-college, college, YRUU, KTRU, post
college, highway/Rice/UH construction, etcetera.</p>

<p>I've found the pictures of Spot climbing up the stairway handrail
like a ladder at me-an-Wende's old house, and some miscellaneous
things I don't remember taking.  Fun stuff.  It's unlikely that any of
them will end up being scanned and on my site unless I find something
just ridiculously amazing.</p>

<p>Been working on Kim Sawyer's site this morning.  Actually just
composing an email of suggested course of action to take on the site.</p>

<p>Got a call from Beth at a Locator Service in California.  She was
looking for a (former?) neighbor of the Bibby's, who is entitled to
some class action lawsuit settlement.  Nice.</p>

<p>Janette came home for lunch.  Sean chose not to go (he was at
Hart's and working on his computer which has a fucked up video adapter
card) so I went with her to Zuzu's mexican food.  Afterward, she was
all, "you wanna get the Eminem CD?"  "Yeah!"  she offered to dub a
copy onto cassette for herself and give me the CD and I was all, "no
way; I'll just rip it to my computer and you can have the CD."</p>

<p>So that's what we did.  She went back to work and I just listened
to the entire CD while reading all the lyrics.  Quite interesting
stuff, that Eminem.  I'm impressed with his rapping skillz.</p>

<p>I'm also impressed with my Mac's skillz of .mp3 file manipulation
and such.  Maybe it's part of the mp3 format, but I am pleasantly
surprised to find that the title and artist and album of the song
seems to be tied to the .mp3 file and not in an external index
somewhere.  Correct?  I dunno, but that's how it appears to work as I
was moving and copying .mp3 files around my machine.</p>

<p>On the way to Marta's in Denton, I talked to Bronwyn, Forest,
Lee-eh on the phone.</p>

<p>Bronwyn is in Connecticut now, and will be in Helena Montana soon.
I may go visit her there; she's supposed to call me tomorrow and we
can figure stuff out.</p>

<p>Forest's mom died yesterday after having multiple heart attacks and
various bodily disfunctions.  He was there and holding her hand when
she died.  It was good to reconnect with him after a multiple year
hiatus when he moved to California.</p>

<p>I left a message for Maggie to the tune of "Daisy Daisy."</p>

<p>Left a message for Kristen as well, wishing her a safe trip down
from New Hampshire to Houston.</p>

<p>Called Lee-eh and talked to her for almost 50 minutes.  She's going
to Japan during the winter, and her trip might happen near the same
time that I go.  She suggested some prefectures and cities for me to
visit while I'm there.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Had planned to go grocery shopping with Marta when I arrived here,
but now I'm too tired.  Bedtime instead.</p>

<p>Cool is that has a copy of The Matrix on DVD now.  Her friend
bought a copy so she could borrow it from him.  Excellent!</p>

<p>This afternoon I spent most of my time moving pictures on my site.
I'm moving them all from my /journal directory to my /images/journal
directory.  That way I can make the mode of all the journal
directories be 600 instead of 644.  Much more secure that way of
course.</p>

<p>Janette got home and invited me to go swimming.  We visited the
Fraternal Order of Eagles lodge type thing, where it seems that
everyone smokes, drinks, listens to sad country music.  Not exactly my
kind of entertainment, but the pool was relatively smokeless.</p>

<p>A dad and his three girls were bouncing a beach ball, measuring
their progress with letters of the alphabet per hit.  The ball usually
hit the water around I, but sometimes they'd get into the O or T
range.  Once they made it to Y.</p>

<p>I did 1 & 1/2 flips off the diving board about four times.  I
couldn't quite get double flips.  I found it a bit challenging cause
it was relatively dark and I couldn't see the surface of the water.
Fun stuff!</p>

<p>Going to Denton now after I shower.</p>
