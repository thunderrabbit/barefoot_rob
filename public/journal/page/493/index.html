<p>Fuckin' Fuck D sucks shit!</p>

<p>He fucked with one of the datasets jsc_relations and erased some
critical values and it caused an error when he was testing.  I had no
idea he had changed the dataset, much less that he was testing the
changes, so when the log checker saw the error and notified us, I
looked at what had happened and saw that the admin was logged in and
saw an error.  In this case the admin is our client contact at
__redacted__.  But actually D was logged in as her and caused the
error.  I didn't think to look at the IP address to see it was one of
our internal addresses; I just saw the error had happened SIX fucking
times, and it was D each fucking time not fucking telling me, "uh hey,
Rob, I just fucking made a change to the dataset and now I'm testing
it and there's an error" but instead he said <em>NOTHING</em> and I
saw the six errors and shot an email to the group here saying that I
was going to contact the client, and did he say anything then ?  NO!!!
So I took at least 2 minutes to look for her contact information,
PLENTY of fucking time for D to fucking say, "oh that was me" and I
sent her an email saying I saw the errors and I'll let her know when
they are fixed.</p>

<p>THEN D was all, "oh that was probably me testing"  PROBABLY?
WAS IT YOU TESTING OR NOT YOU FUCKING IDIOT???  DO YOU EVER MAKE A
CERTAIN STATEMENT IN YOUR LIFE?  LIKE YOU ARE A FUCKING IDIOT????
FUCK!!!! Oh, so maybe I should *probably* not have sent the email to
the client and you should probably get a fist in the face cause you
suck shit!</p>

<p>I found the problem with the dataset, asked D, "did you modify
the jsc_relations dataset?" ("yeah") fixed the error, during which
time D added, "all I did was blah blah blah."</p>

<p>No, in fact, that is *not* all you did.  You also erased these two
critical values and you suck shit for not paying attention to the work
you do around here!  All sorts of fucking errors are your fault and we
all look like idiots because of it.  Lost a fucking client because of
it.  You suck!</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>So I talked to him; asked if he had gotten the emails that I had
sent to the group.  He claims he did not.  He should be on that
distribution list; I'll check.  He is on the list.</p>

<p>So things are basically better.  I still think he should have told
me when the first error came up, and he thinks I should have told him
as I was sending an email to our group to say I was assuming she had
seen the error.  So we're "even" on that.</p>

<p>BUT(!) I still contend that he should be more careful when
modifying datasets.  Duh!</p>

<p>We've agreed that he is in charge of this project, and any errors
..... I just figured out what it is.</p>

<p>Okay.  D normally seems to be unaware of most things going on
around him.  Like when the phone rings and he is the only one near a
phone.  Or when people have conversations in the same room.  "So what
do you think, D?"  "What?  oh, I wasn't listening" kinda thing.</p>

<p>So why should I suddenly think that he is conscious and watching
for errors caused by the admin of a project?  Why would I think, "oh
D's on the ball; he's not dumb; he'll handle it"??  that's right,
there is no reason for me to think that.</p>

<p>So there.  D is wack and I am right.  </p>

<p>But now we've agreed that he is in charge of the project and any
errors that occur with it are his responsibility to make sure they are
handled.  Fine by me.</p>

<p>Hung out at work a while, working on my Plano Rally journal
entries.  Chose not to put images on tonight.  Left work.  While
walking from work toward the post office, crossing Shepherd, a
jeep-car thing honked and changed lanes in a weird way.  I thought,
"weirdo," and then the jeep-car thing pulled up in front of me.</p>

<p>It was Danielle!!</p>

<p>Holy fuckin' shit jumped into the car and gave her a hug and
wow!</p>

<p>She drove me to the post office and then to the bank and then to my
apartment parking lot (grand total of 5 blocks) where we sat and
talked for over an hour.  She's divorced and remarried, seems to be
quite happy in life.  So wonderful!</p>

<p>We determined it's been almost 7 years since we've seen one
another.</p>

<p>She knows a guy who has taught English in China.  I've been shying
away from China, but it keeps coming up... so maybe...</p>

<p>Wow.  Lovely timing.</p>

<p>Slept mostly from 3pm to 9pm after the rally.  Had a terrible
headache most of the night past that.  I ate some food; that didn't
help.  I had slept; that hadn't helped.</p>

<p>I think it might be cause my apartment was hot.  Only like 80
degrees, but I felt better after going outside to do laundry.</p>

<p>After laundry, I visited work to catch up on email and CYA meeting
stuff. (Committee on Youth Advisors)</p>

<p>Going back home to move laundry from washer to dryer and sleep some
more.</p>

<p class=date>5:16pm</p>

<p>I slept thoroughly this morning.  3 hours seemed like 20 minutes.
20 minutes seemed like 1 minute.</p>

<p>Today I've gotten some shit done, but it's taken a while to get
momentum going, it seems.  Got my taxes turned in as well.</p>

<p class=date>7:20pm</p>

<p>Going to Wende's for dinner tonight.</p>

very very very beryvery bery confusing.  Shrugs are no fun.....they make it

way to many questions.  A new two way warmhole between the quuite confused
Little Funk and Hume Chalice and from SkateBetty an TekiMaster....making
this fun yet confusing game hat much more interesting- if we can ever get far
enough to send the football through each of the two, two way warmholes, and
the one way warmhole.  Sugar Magnolia Flopped it throught the warm hole of

<p>In honor of Comic Book Guy on The Simpsons, "Best Game Ever."</p>

<p>I'm so thankful to all the beautiful people willing to stay awake to play
with bizarre rules.  You guys are so great!</p>

<p class=message>Calder: "Did you hear about corduroy pillows?"</p>

<p class=message>Grant: "no."</p>

<p class=message>"They're making headlines."</p>

<p class=message>Rob: "That was great embellishment."</p>

<p>Calder looks around like she's looking for thoughts in her head, "dude,
I just reached Nirvana."</p>

<p>We laugh a bit and ignore her.</p>

<p>"No, I'm <em>serious!</em></p>

<p>- - - - -</p>

<p>Though only four players are awake enough to play, we came up with
a way to form two parallel universes.  Players in each universe could
only fwap or zoom to players in their own universe.  Each universe
could be connected with worm holes on certain players.  So amazing
that game would be!</p>

<p>(Later, I came up with the final touch to this plan: we have a
dictator in each universe.  While the ball is moving around, it will
randomishly alternate between universes.  Then when someone makes an
error, only people in that player's universe can tattle to that
universe's dictator.  This would be the perfect time for the other
universe to go get a snack or pee.)</p>

<p>Tom told us a brief version of the story of Lucy Decker (?) who
started the first Gay Lesbian Straight Alliance in Massachusetts in
1992.</p>

<p>Amazing to think about a 14 year old starting this program and
spreading it to other schools, and generating enough interest that the
governor funded the programs with 500 thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Over years, she helped it grow to a huge rally thing of 7500 people
in one day event.</p>

<p class=message>what the world needs now is love sweet love. and more
chocolate.</p>

<p>Laura wrote a random limerick about Lucy:</p>

<pre>
Lucy was one rockin' 'dyke'
She told prejudice 'take a hike!'
By starting GSAs
Things are  better for gays
Now she is one youth that we like.

<p>Fred got a few tips from Tom on juggling clubs.  Seems that these will
really help Fred progress in his skillz.</p>

<p>After juggling a bit, we tried to hackey sack with the clubs and I bonked
the shit out of my ankle with a club.  ow!!!!</p>

<p class=date>5:24 pm Saturday 13 April 2002</p>

<p>Just spent some hour+ with Colleen and Fred telling stories of me
an' Fred when we were little.  Most laughs describing Fred playing
soccer when he was 5 or so.  And by playing, we mean walking endlessly
around the chalk circle in the middle of the field.  And then getting
bored of that and picking flowers, sitting over by mom.  Funny funny
stuff.</p>

<p>Bryn and I were sitting next to one another looking at her pictures
of London and Paris when the lights went out as we were beckoned to
the mass wedding.</p>

<p>Not an *actual* wedding, but an invitation for each person to honor
others in friendship - these incredible bonds that YRUU makes
possible.</p>

<p>This activity started in Plano a few years ago, and they had an
anniversary each year afterward.  Since YRUU has such a high turnover
rate, most youth here now weren't at the original event, making
anniversaries a bit silly, so this year, another mass wedding.</p>

<p>I really wanted to marry Bryn, but didn't know if we would be
interrupted by other youth who wanted to marry me, or, and this was my
greater expectation, that many people would want to marry Bryn.</p>

<p>Then we were in the circle and Bryn asked if I would marry her.
"It would be my greatest pleasure," I smiled.</p>

<p>Doug Strong introduced the ceremony, then invited individuals who were
marrying themselves to place left arm on right shoulder and right arm on
left shoulder.</p>

<p>Pairs of people were invited to put one hand on each others
shoulder, and groups of people to form a group hug.  Then people who
intended to marry everyone come to the middle into the light.</p>

<p>Bryn and I faced each other with hands on shoulders and were
approached by Mike and Lisa to be a foursome.  Bryn looked to me,
asking with her eyes.  I was all, "ummmememrrr," keeping my hands on
Bryn's shoulders.  It was so hard to turn them down, and I certainly
didn't do it cleanly, but we remained a couple and Mike and Lisa
joined the marry-everyone group when that option was offered.  (*)</p>

<p>Doug invited us to share with one another our passions.</p>

<p>"Travel, Dance, Painting, YRUU, smiles," me.</p>

<p>"Travel, family, love...," she.</p>

<p>We all had been given inexpensive little gold rings.  When
instructed, Bryn put hers on my left pinky finger.  I chose her right
ring finger, though both her ring fingers sported rings already.  Some
more words from Doug and then, "I now pronounce you married!"</p>

<p>And we hugged so big and I just started to cry.</p>

<p>"Are you laughing?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Cried cried so much passion for Bryn and life and love and for five
incredible years of knowing, loving, supporting, encouraging, teaching
each other..</p>

<p>Bryn began to cry as well.  Gentle sobs and tears.  She was all,
"Thank you for the last five years...." and then, "you have been the
only person who has been here for me the entire time."  more precious
tears from each of us.</p>

<p>It has been my utmost pleasure to be here for you Bryn.  Then I was
all, "in the past year it has become perfectly clear to me that I have
been in YRUU for you."</p>

<p>Huge tears from Bryn.  Huge huge tears and sobs.  So thankful to be
perfectly here for Bryn.</p>

<p>I chose not to say anything about having been at Emerson YRUU
specifically for Jon.  This is Bryn's moment.  My moment with Bryn.  I love
you love you so much.</p>

<p>We had held each other tightly for already five minutes at this
point, and for easily ten more as we just cried.  My tears completed
and I just held my dear Bryn to capture this moment clearly in my
heart and mind for all eternity.</p>

<p>Re-structured our hug so I was on her level.  More huge hugs.</p>

<p>People came up to me and Bryn are you okay?  "Yes" and (thumbs up)
and Simon wanted to hug Bryn cause she was crying.. and he innocently
asked what was wrong.</p>

<p>I answered.  "This has been like me and Bryn's Senior circle We are
leaving YRUU soon, and have enjoyed five incredible years together.
Bryn is going to school in August, and next year I'm going to
Japan."</p>

<p>Simon was all, "no; you can't leave!"</p>

<p>"You'll go too," I hugged him bigly.  "Anywhere you want, you can
go."</p>

<p>Later, Ian was all, "thank you for being so awesome at Fort Worth
Rally."</p>

<p>I thanked him for the blessing and the opportunity to be there for
him. </p>

<h2 id="march-2015">March 2015</h2>

<p>(*) I still sometimes think about turning them down.  I&rsquo;m sorry I was
so selfish and wish I could go back to that moment and include them as
well.</p>

<p>After the mass marriage, I sat by Marta, one of the Plano advisors.
She's been a local advisor for a while, but hadn't been active with
rallies due to performance in theater type stuff.</p>

<p>I told her a bit about me and my history in YRUU, my plans for the
future and my work now to create the CYA support for youth advisors.</p>

<p>Our conversation got interrupted with Baby Got Back for which i
*had* to get up even though in the middle of a story..</p>

<p>I sang it hugely with peeps on dance floor.</p>

<p>Ran right back to Marta to finish the story.  Then the dance really
began.</p>

<p>We're about to play Silent football now, after I write a few notes.
Um.... smooth rally, but the music is being played a bit too loudly.
or was being played too loudly.  T-shirts have long sleeves instead of
short.</p>

<p>Graham and I did some quick studying of the Austin mugbook as we
closed in on Plano.  It's really help me with names tonight.  Got to
see Robin, who was Robin Daffinee in my YRUU days.  Gave her a massage
during opening circle.</p>

<p>My brother Fred is here.  And Mike (Captain Harlock), his friend
from YRUU.  How weird and cool to see them both again.  I think it's
great they are getting involved as advisors in YRUU.  I wonder if
they'll serve on YAC, etc.</p>

<p>Laura Burleson is here after attending last year's Plano rally. She
looks a lot older; I wonder if it's just because she has no braces
now.</p>

<p>Matt says, "I can't play [SF] now because it's not tomorrow night
yet."</p>

<br>Dark child: 'Mister dictator sir' Ben(bartleby) HAS to do the booty dance

recieves 1/2 a penance point for doing th ants and cheese dance in place of
the zoom zoom booty dance.

<p>Did three-headed-monster skit with Bryn and Phat Pat.  We were
asked, "What does UU stand for?"  Bryn said, "uh," so I said, "uh,"
and the audience enjoyed it, but Bryn didn't get it at first.  I had
to explain to to her. heehee.</p>

<p>We were also asked why we always do this skit.  "Cause" "it's"
"funny!"</p>

<p>Oh, before we went onstage, we were dancing to the side of the
audience while Amber sang on stage.  Several people saw us, and nudged
their friends to look.  :-)</p>
