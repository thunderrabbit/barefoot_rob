<p>Dave had a super good idea for helping the maintenance of the G3
project be a lot easier.  Part of the project is a list of variable
names and values.  The names are referenced in the code, and by
changing the values, G3 does different stuff.</p>

<p>Dave determined that the values can reference one another, so long
as the value that's being referenced was defined before it's used.
This required a small change to how the values of the variables were
being defined, but we just tested it and it works perfectly.</p>

<p>End result is that the stuff I was working on today will become way
simpler to write.  Simple enough that I don't need Kevin's SAS brain
to help write it.</p>

<p>You know what else?  Kevin suggested that I write a paper on the G3
and present it at the next SUGI.  Wow!!  Wow!!  That's a huge
endorsement on how awesome is G3.  Nice.</p>

<p>I'm at work now.  About to go home.  Our client in
Singapore was all, "we're not getting any of the
password-resend emails."</p>

<p>Turns out that <em>no one</em> is getting the
password resend emails, because our mail server thinks
our web server is trying to use the mail server as a
spam email relay.</p>

<p>Fuck.</p>

<p>I tried telling our mail server to chill, but it
seems pretty adamant that the web server is an evil
spam creator.  Silly computers.</p>

<p>I'm going to bed.</p>

<p>Right after I log my hours.</p>

<p class=dream>I was in prison, in a two person cell with none other
than Hannibal from the movies.  The guard asked me to clean up some
trash on the sink.  The guard told me to clean up the mess, but not to
throw away a towel.  Hannibal insisted that we throw away the towel,
and the guard and I assumed the towel had some Hannibal-indicting
evidence in it, and since Hannibal was scarier than the guard, I did
throw it away, and tried to be subtle about it.</p>

<p class=dream>The guard saw that I had thrown it away, and I told him
that I threw it away because it was all wet.  He pulled the towel out
of the trash can, and the towel was inside a plastic bag.  I didn't
know what was in the towel that Hannibal had thrown away, but now it
appeared to the guard that I was trying to help Hannibal.</p>

<p class=dream>I watched in great fear as the guard <em>was</em>
Hannibal and told me how bad it was that I had thrown away the towel
against his orders.  He asked me why I had done it and I thought about
lying and saying that I was thinking about the time I worked in a
hospital ER, where it was unclean to keep anything so we threw stuff
away to keep sterile.</p>

<p class=dream>But I didn't tell him this lie for fear that he would
know I was lying.</p>

<p class=dream>He psychologically freaked me out by not opening up
the towel to be all "aha! look what you hid." but he used his mouth to
vacuum pack the towel inside the trash bag. and he tied off the
corner so it would stay sealed.  He did this at both ends, and tied
the ends off and then was working on a third end, sucking the air out
with his mouth, but the towel was sticking out of the end, so he
play-acted that he was deep throating the towel as he had been forced
to do back when he was younger, by a man named Arpelagio.</p>

<p class=dream>Hannibal today was playing the role as he sucking the
air out of this trash bag, as if he was being raped by a man who had
raped him many years ago.</p>

<p class=dream>I was up on my bunk in our prison cell, watching him
play act getting raped in the ass, and then play act the part of
Arpelagio who orgasmed and then was finished.</p>

<p class=dream>I had a towel of my own now, while on the bed watching
this, and I knew that Hannibal had wanted to scare me with this
performance, so I wrapped the towel up around my hands as if I had
wringed it around my hands in fear.</p>

<p class=dream>He asked me why I was so upset, and I told him that I
had been moved by his performance because I had been raped, but not in
the ass, but was asked to suck a guy, but I just couldn't and it was
really gross and terrible.</p>

<p class=dream>Then Hannibal was gone, which was even more spooky, but
I go down off my bunk, and was all, "Hannibal?" and "Dr Lecter?"
looking for him, afraid that he would appear behind me at any
moment.</p>

<p class=dream>But he wasn't there, and I noticed that the doors to
our cell were open on either side.  One side led toward inside the
prison, which was more like a waiting room, and a different guard was
standing there, and the other door was a garage door that led to
outside, and Hannibal had gone out that door.</p>

<p class=dream>I went through the inside door, and talked to the guard
a bit about what was on TV, some news about a local charity event or
something, and then Hannibal came back in through the garage door, and
through the inner door, and was all cordial with us, and then he
suddenly pulled out a knife and was cutting off my left arm at the
shoulder, and I tried to grab his hand, and then realized he was
actually doing worse, and was actually just wiping blood onto my
shoulder off of the knife blade, in an attempt to make me look guilty
for the murder he had apparently just committed outside.</p>

<p class=dream>I tried to wrestle him and keep him from killing me,
and the knife got lodged inside the bumper of a red camaro that was
nearby.  We were outside now, in a courtyard, which included psych
patients walking around with escorts.  Wende was suddenly there, and
she was spookily walking behind me where I couldn't see her, and she
snuck over and grabbed the knife and dropped it into the pocket of one
of the psych patients who was walking across the courtyard.</p>

<p class=dream>The person into whose pocket she put the knife would
never be charged with murder because of her condition, but Wende was
just trying to get the knife away from Hannibal, who would try again
to use it on me.</p>

<p class=dream>I woke myself up out of abject fear to get out of this
dream.</p>

<p>After watching Futurama (fun episode satirizing (sp) Exxon Valdez
spill, where Bender turns into a penguin) Wende and I went to College
Night at The Container Store to help Elise' get a bunch of goodies for
her dorm room at A&M.</p>

<p>Quite a huge big deal is the College Night - the place was
<em>packed</em>, and everyone was getting hundreds of dollars worth of
stuff.  No one was fighting over particular items, but when a new pile
of under-bed drawers was presented from the back, they were snatched
up like breadcrumbs at the beach.</p>

<p>I got some small fuzzy stickers shaped like kittens.</p>

<p>I'm chillin' at Container Store.  Kimling just
showed me Frogger on her Palm Pilot.  She has a cool
chrome hardcover case for it.</p>

<p>Her two year old website (meaning two years ago
built and not maintained) is mostly a bunch of links
to Asian businesses in Houston and community centers. 
Most of the images on her site are actually stored on
other peoples' sites.  That's funny.  She doesn't
remember the URL.</p>

<p class=date>1:07 pm</p>

<p>Now Wende and I are just finished munching lunch
with my dad and Karen, his girlfriend.  We are about
to go see Legally Blonde, which I've never previously
heard of, and I'm not particularly interested in
seeing, but Wende said, "you'll be okay, there's cute
girls in it."  Hmf.</p>

<p>I want to see The Fast and The Furious, and.. Pearl
Harbor, and..  um  AI.</p>

<p>I'm at KTRU right now, and we have internet access
from the station now!  Wheeee!!!</p>

<p>I played "Hellbringer" by Panacea when a guy
requested some dark drum and bass.  He suggested an
artist called Groove Rider, but we didn't have that. 
Panacea worked though, he called me back to thank me
for playing it.  Awesome!!</p>

<p>Played an awesome song by Cerberous Shoal, off of
the CD <em>Crash My Moon Yacht</em>.  Awesome song,
but I forgot the name of it.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, "Breathing Machines"  Very cool.</p>

<p>I'm going to go play ultimate!!</p>

<p>Great fun at ultimate tonight!  So awesome to play
again.  I haven't played in about 2 or 3 months it
seems.  Ironically, no one has played the Saturday
night game in a pretty long time; it shifted to nights
during the week, which are often scheduled with other
things for me.</p>

<p>Great to hug Kat again.  She's got a job at NASA! 
Also great that Tony and Kat have medical tape and
gauze, cause I cut a nickel sized flap of skin from
the end of my left big toe.  Nickel size in diameter
and thickness.  Plenty of blood to clean it out, and
we taped it up so I could play three(!) more games. 
We had to retape it once cause it started to come
undone, but pretty much my toe is perfectly preserved
so I can go clean it out and put triple-antibiotic on
it tonight.</p>

<p>I didn't have a lot of amazing catches tonight..
well, one awesome go-go-gadget-arm catch while
running.  I made some definitely good throws,
threading the disc through defenders several
times.</p>

<p>I'm tired, and am going to bed (after I summon the
energy to clean up my toe.  Should probably take a
full blown shower.  Ugh.</p>

<p>Crap crap crap going on at work here.  We've got
tons and tons of data, and I've written this super
great G3 to display surveys, but now there's a concern
about which set of questions has been displayed for
which projects, and from where did this excel
spreadsheet of sample questions come?</p>

<p>So it's easy enough to figure out which surveys
display which questions, but to compare ridiculously
similar excel spreadsheets with other excel
spreadsheets versus SAS datasets converted to
spreadsheets (with some of the columns removed to make
it easier on the end users who will see it)</p>

<p>We've got people poring through these spreadsheets
to find differences.  this sucks shit.</p>

<p>I am *so* surprised that no one (on my friends
list) has written about greeting Bryn at the airport. 
Ashley was closest by saying she was <em>going</em> to
go, but.. no one that did go has written.</p>

<p>I got two letters today!  One from Shira, who
briefly described moving with her parents, and
included her prom picture, and one from my step sister
Karina, who described how she's been too busy to
write.  That's her excuse and she's sticking to it. 
Snail mail is great!</p>

<p>We had our second to last Spanish III class
tonight, which we attended instead of our investment
club meeting.  The meeting was moved to the second
Thursday because of 4 July, but we were already
committed to Spanish, so we skipped investment club. 
Wende turned in all our stuff to Cynthia today, who
took it to the meeting.  Wende will get it back from
her tomorrow, so I can enter all the deposits into the
computer and stuff.</p>

<p>Work today was pretty good; we had a conference
call with a new client, who is going to be using the
G3 with a few modifications.  Actually the
modifications that require coding changes will be
incorporated into the full G3 so every other client
will be able to use them.</p>

<p>I am <em>so close</em> to being able to set up a
new survey in 5 minutes.  Well, not that close, but
pretty darn close.  Like a week maybe, given help from
Kevin.  I need to be able to detect the existence of
datasets and directories so they don't get
overwritten, and be able to create new ones where they
don't exist.</p>

<p>Five minutes, down from two weeks is.... a lot
fucking faster.</p>

<p>80 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 4800 minutes... so
5 minutes brings it almost down to 1/1000th of the
time?  Nice.</p>

<p>Wende and I fought on the way home about who did or
did not / should or should not have signed us both up
for Spanish IV.  The bottom line is that we're not
signed up.  I'll do it tomorrow, if there's space
available.  Totally stupid fight.  Blah.</p>

<p>I am SO FAR Behind in my journal, but I did make
good headway today and got some entries actually moved
to my website, but I still have to clean them up. 
They were written on my Visor from New Orleans Rally,
and from the weekend Wende and I went to Oklahoma.</p>

<p>Speaking of Oklahoma, Bryn came home today!  My
sense is that she had an enormous welcoming party at
the airport!  I would have enjoyed being there, but I
had to be at stinky work.</p>

<p>I'm writing now to say that I'm about to ride my
bike home and then <em>skate</em> to Wende's work,
just for the exercise of it.  She gets off work at
10pm, so I have an hour and 1/2. Or so.  I think I can
make it no problem.</p>
