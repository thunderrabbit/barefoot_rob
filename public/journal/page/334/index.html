<p>Miki waved at me between classes and I smiled bigly at her during
the last class, through the glass between our rooms.  Mmmm.  She's
cute.</p>

<p>Today was Stephanie's first day.  She seemed to be sick at first; I
dunno if it was just nerves, because she seemed to make it throught
the day no problem.  Jen and Adriana, on the other hand, didn't even
*start* their days; they each tapatsued (our word for called in
sick).</p>

<p>Quote of the day:</p>

<pre>I won ten thousand, billion dollars in casino.</pre>

<p>I had topic voice on pronounciation today.  That went relatively
well.  Kenji consistently wouldn't shape his mouth to form W, V, B, R
sounds.  He's a pretty old cat; kinda set in his ways.  Most other
students did well.  One woman got all the words basically perfect,
except for "vocabulary," the most incorrectly pronounced English word
in Japan.  (other than "clothes")</p>

<p>I'm at Starbucks before my lesson with Ayana at 9:30.  I'm gonna
study now.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Man, Ayana is cool.  I was feelin' all crappy about how much
Japanese I don't know and she did a review with me and helped me
recoginize how much Japanese I *do* know, and pointed out two areas
that I need to work on: adjectives and verb vocabulary.  I was pretty
proficient with stuff like, "I study at 2:00 at the library" and "the
pen is in/on/under/behind/(in front/to the left/to the right) of the
phone" and okay at te form conjugation.</p>

<p>Felt much better after seeing my progress.</p>

<p>Hahaha  I kick off the day with three free lessons.  Sweet.  Then a
man to man then I get lunch.  Then another free.  My last three
lessons I teach a total of 5 students.   Sweet.</p>

<p class=date>3:25pm</p>

<p>Woo.</p>

<p>My first >M&lt; lesson got switched from a 7C student to a level 6
student.  That's good news.  The better news is that this level 6
student is the one that said, "Why don't we go to dinner?" when I
asked her to give examples of "Why don't ..."  I didn't answer
positively then because it was our first lesson, and (mostly) because
Yukiji (or was it Satoko?) was nearby and I didn't want to be overtly
seeing two students - trying to lower my risk of being caught.  (In
ways other than not writing about my adventures online.)</p>

<p class=date>5:01pm</p>

<p>She has my email now.</p>

<p>Easy day at work.  Hardest part was a four person class, but I only
had to observe the class being taught for me.  Nice.  The instructor
is Caroline, from Scotland.  Fun accent.</p>

<p>Best part at work was the man to man lessons in the beginning and
the man to man voice.  Maybe I'll be chatting with some more students
outside of class.</p>

<p>Talked to janette this morning. From happy to crushed to stable
again.  Don't want to go to work right about now.</p>

<p>Thankful for janette's continued love and support.  Afraid to break
up with her.  Never want to let her go.  Have to.  For some fucked up
reason (self depricating) I have to.</p>

<p>What is the lesson?  Fuck smart ass answerers.</p>

<p>How can I break away from adoration?</p>

<br>what do you mean -self-deprEcating? you have to break up with me because you devalue yourself? wha...????<br>
<br>
i wish you would have labeled it admiration instead of adoration.  adoration makes me sound like a lovesick puppy.<br>
<br>
you are thankful for my love and support. it is interesting that you do not mention how much you love and support me.<br>
 <br>
o rob<br>
<br>
i thought you have to break up with me because you are not devoted to me.  because you are not sure i am as good as it gets.  because i am 17 years older than you. because you don't know how to love in the deepest, committed way. because your head is constantly turned by what might be. because i am not the one. because you are a fool. because i am a fool.<br>
<br>
because we both know Just because we have respect, admiration,liking,LOVE, a beautiful physical fit,a love of sexual expression, FUN,spiritual understanding,because we inspire and encourage and embolden each other,because we nurture  each others' growth and wellbeing,  well.. that doesn't seem to count because     um, what was the reason ?  oh yeah-see above. or is it because i am not sure where to put the apostrophe in "other's" ?<br>
<br>
does this sound a little hard?  i am sad and i am covering it up with some anger at you for not recognizing me. i am mostly, as it always seems to *come down to*,upset with myself for putting myself under a spell. feeding an illusion that has not enough substance to stand up to reality.<br>
the illusion being that  the love i feel for you is reciprocated and is sufficient to feed itself and grow into bigger love.<br>
the reality being that we are far apart. in time and space and  and<br>
 i am tired.i love you.  o rob, i will always love you. <br>
goodnite.
