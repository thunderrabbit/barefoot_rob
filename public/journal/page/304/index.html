<p>One goal was to get good headway done on my studying.  I'm keen (*)
  on learning the kanji for these words; kanji are easier than I
  expected for me to learn, but I don't have a kanji stroke order
  dictionary.  I looked up the stroke order for 食 of 食べる and the
  dictionary I found showed an order I would not have predicted, so
  much so that I wanted to find another dictionary to confirm it.  I
  didn't find another dictionary for that kanji, but I did find a
  different dictionary for a diffferent kanji that the first
  dictionary had and they show slightly different stroke orders.

<p>The *point* of this entry is that I didn't actually get any real
  studying done, but felt just bluh after being online for so long
  and then realized I should have just stuck with hiragana to
  practice the verb conjugations which is what I wanted to actually
  practice anyway.  Oh well.  I'm going to nap for a bit (?) and then
  study in the morning.</p>

<p>From my dear Maggie:</p>

<pre>
  Comfort vs. Healing - 
Comfort feels good.  Comfort can be found quickly and applied at
request to where we hurt most.  But there's a big drawback to comfort,
it requires something outside of ourselves.  Comfort covers our wounds
so we don't have to look at them and we can pretend they're not there.
Comfort may even find a way to trick us into thinking the wound is
gone.  However, since comfort requires an outside source, when the
outside source is gone, we learn that the wounds are still there,
sometimes even worse than before the comfort.  So we typically look
for comfort again hoping for the oblivion, even if it will only be
temporary.  Healing is hard.  Healing takes work and can not be found
quickly.  Healing is a force of our will to make a wound whole again.
Healing takes time and the healing process can feel worse than the
wound sometimes.  Healing has to be done without an outside source
(aside from God, who is really a force that works within us, I think)
The good news about healing is that when we've undergone our process,
the wound is gone, for real.  Some people seek comfort and some people
seek healing.  You get to choose.  My Friend, I think that it is
within you to heal your pattern with women, but it may be more
difficult since women are such a source of comfort to you.
</pre>

<p>I was working on my drawing when I got a page from janette,
  "nevermind," the previous page for which had been "pls call me,"
  and I was like hh hh hh and called her anyway.  Almost a mistake,
  but we made it good in the end.  This work of honesty is really
  hard and rewarding.</p>

<p>I may go back to Austin to work on this chaos within me.</p>

<p>I hung out with あつこ at the かわ for a few hours, studying and
  helping her study and talking about みき and janette.  She (Atsuko)
  is definitely of the camp that I should stay in Japan.  Hmm.
  Hmf.</p>

<p>Now I'm at home and have found that I can't study very well with
  Eminem blasting on my stereo.  Not so surprising I guess.</p>

<p>Dammit.  Someone stole the light off my bike during the 36 hours
  that I left it locked in 川崎。 Fuck.  Well I hope they enjoy it.  I
  was just about to recharge the batteries on it, too. I'm glad I
  hadn't *just* recharged them.  4000 yen light and 1200 yen
  rechargeable batteries.  Sigh.</p>

<p>But good news is it will take about three hours of work to make
that much money back.</p>

<p>Other good(?) news is most bikes on the road (though it was fully
  dark) didn't have lights on.</p>

<p>Hmmm.</p>

<p>For some reason my journal seems to be fucking up when I start
  with the base URL /journal, which refreshes to
  /cgi-local/journal.pl (that refresh works okay, but) the refresh
  for which resolves to /cgi-local/journal.pl?date[latest_date] (this
  is the part that fucks up.)</p>

<p>But, if I just enter /cgi-local/journal.pl?date[latest_date], it's
  fine.  Hmmmm.</p>

<p>Ah, cool.  It only fucks up with Safari (d'oh), and hopefully not
  most browsers.  My version of IE works okay.</p>

<p>Huge bawling tears on the phone with janette tonight.  We talked
  about Miki and I recognize just how horrible a situation this is
  for her; it's just like Miki is the innocent victim in this; she's
  cuter than cute and seems to really like me, but I'm unavailable
  and still hanging out with her in a way where part of me is wanting
  for more, but I'm telling her and reminding myself no no no.</p>

<p>A few moments ago had I been typing, there'd be none of this silly
  grammatical correctness.</p>

<p>I feel so much shame at myself for all the women with whom I've
  fallen in love and broken up with, Miki, janette, Sally, Wende,
  Amanda, Christine, Tammy, Lynda, and that's just counting the main
  ones and *not* counting the abortion and the miscarriage.  My
  relationship life is a fucking nightmare and I want to stop the
  pattern.  I want to solve this, but the problem seems unsolvable.
  What could I possibly do that would help a fish not live in
  water?</p>

<p>How can I possibly change so that this ingrained pattern is
  released?</p>

<p>What is the first step?  Who do I talk to?  Can it be done in
  Japan?  Should it be done in Japan?  Why would I think there are
  right answers to this?  What guidance can I get from my angels?</p>

<p>So much sadness.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I wondered about living with Fred.  I like him; I like Austin.
  We could just be brothas together and I could go to some kind of
  counseling and get a job at Amy's Ice Cream and just live a simple
  life for a while.</p>

<p>(how does that feel?)</p>

<p class=date>7:28am JST Tuesday 9 December 2003</p>

<p>Oh, I also felt like it's just too late to start such a big
  impossible project.  Like by the time I fix this, I'll be a million
  years old and too old to do anything worthwhile.</p>

<p>I'm really good at starting new projects.  It's easy for me to
  fall in love with a new woman.  I don't seem to be as good at
  following through with projects.   I haven't even written about the
  coasters at Yomiuriland yet.</p>

<p>I have a great fear that if I leave Japan to embark on this bold
  adventure of healing myself of this hurtful relationship pattern,
  that I'll never completely follow through.  That comes from two
  points of view: 1) that it's an unsolvable problem and 2) that I
  don't finish projects.</p>

<p>If I leave Japan, there are many people that I would miss: Morag,
  Miki, Liz, Carla, Nami, Tomoko, Rieko, Ayana, Jen, Orivia ... I see
  that these are all women.  There is something amiss in this
  situation.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>As I think about this idea of leaving Japan to heal myself, I want
  all sorts of external validation for my decision.  Kristen told me
  most clearly that this must come from within.  janette told me most
  encouragingly that it's okay to seek external advice when the
  problems seem to have no solutions.</p>

<p>I want to ask Rebecca Montgomery, my psychic friend from a long
  time ago.  I want to ask Kim Sawyer.  I'm still in touch with him so
  I'll send him this entry.  I want to ask Maggie, who has done
  similar internal transformative growth and supports me in whatever I
  do.  I want to ask Wende, who knows me the best and often tells me
  straight from her heart.  I want to ask my I-group.  How the fuck
  could I forget about them?</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>If I move to Austin, I could work at Amy's Ice Cream.  That might
  be fun.  I wonder what else I could do for work.  Morag is the first
  person to ever tell me that waiting tables is really fun.  I wonder
  if I would like that.  I wonder if I could get a job as a counselor;
  Frank has done this recently.  Do I have the official
  credentials?</p>

<p>If I move to Austin, I could hang out with my brother, my mom and
  that guy more easily.</p>

<p>If I move to Austin,</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I could ride my bike most places I need to go (and get lots of
    exercise with all the hills)</p></li>

<li><p>I would be in Texas (Wende's favorite state) and Wende would be
    in California (my favorite state (except Hawaii, but it shouldn't
    be a state; we should release the islands to the natives, but
    that's a different story)).</p></li>

<li><p>I could join an I-group.  (I could actually drive to Houston
    each week (given a car) and attend *my* I group)</p></li>

<li><p>I could volunteer at 91.7 KVRX or KOOP.  (Hell fuckin' yeah
    that would be pimp to get back into radio)</p></li>

<li><p>I have a great fear that I would never get myself back out
    "into the world"</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Oh shit here is a big one...  I am afraid that if I heal this, that
  I will be grown up and that I won't be able to travel freely like
  this.  I wonder where that comes from.  There's a dual thought-form:
  ... yarg, I can't quite get it back again.  Something like if I
  solve this within myself I will be disinterested (too old? (as I
  said above) too mature?  too grounded?) in travel and therefore will
  have missed my opportunity, which I'm in right now.  I'm
  in <em>JAPAN</em> right now; why would I want to go back?</p>

<p>(( There is a corallary to this point which says that if I don't
  want to do something then I won't be concerned if I don't do it. But
  that doesn't really solve this concern. ))</p>

<p>I would *definitely* want to continue studying Japanese.</p>

<p>Wouldn't I?</p>

<p>-- -- -- --</p>

<p>Okay, I'm going to embark upon my day.  Letter to Bryn, Beans,
  Chez, and then meet Atsuko.  Oh shit I'm going to carefully check
  email first.  Carefully = cautiously.  No web browsing.  Only
  email.  Okay.  I promise myself.</p>

<p>Two(?) more things before I go:</p>

<p>1) If I leave now-ishly, then I will give Miki this art thing I've
  been working on.</p>

<p>2) I trust my angels guide me.</p>

<br>yay yay yay.<br>
  good work mate.<br>
yay for crying.<br>
    for looking at things the way they are and being able to talk it out and look at  yourself honestly.<br>
    for caring about miki's feelings and your need to change the current situation, at least for her sake.<br>
    for me having my name in  small case so i have some special-ness in your long list of used to be's.* <br>
    for you considering a simple life while you grow.<br>
    for taking  first steps.<br>
    for your fears and for your courage.<br>
    for the intuitive part of me that tells me you will heal and grow and be even more fucking awesome than you are now.<br>
    for you being rob.<br>
<br>
<br>
( i hate that i am not in a category all to myself. i hate that i am one of a list.  i hate that i did not have better control over my dreams.  i hate that people reading your journal have very little idea  of who i am. i hate that my ego is so demanding and uses the word hate so much.)

<p>Good times at work today.  Pretty easy day, for which I'm
  definitely thankful.  Saw high school Miki there; she attended voice
  for the two non-consecutive timeslots surrounding my voice duty.
  It's rare for students to leave a lesson (or voice) early, but fully
  one half of the students left voice today.  He was apologetic, and I
  was like, "it's cool, bro," but I was left with a man to man 7C ish
  student who could answer in one or two words and not form questions
  for me.</p>

<p>My last lesson was with a 5 year old named Haraka I think.  She was
  pretty non-responsive to my boring non-five-year-oldness, so we had
  a lesson under the table.  That was hopefully fun for her, but it
  kinda cramped my neck.  Oh well.</p>

<p>That was my last lesson and I was like yeeeha I get to ride my
  bike outta here!</p>

<p>But then...</p>

<p>Long sleep sure feels yummy.</p>

<p>Morag got my message around midnight; says her phone has been
  screwing up.</p>

<p>I was sleepin' when she emailed me and too tired to reply, so I
  fell back asleep after the phone woke me up.  In my sleep I wondered
  what time she texted me and I kept checking my phone but I couldn't
  figure out how to use it.  Of course I was checking some complicated
  dream phone or maybe my phone but without my physical body.</p>

<p>Still don't know my password.  Maybe my grammatically correct
  query didn't make sense.</p>

David     Ok. I reset it.

<p>Saw <em>The Last Samurai</em> tonight.  I'm glad Tom and Taka
  didn't make out; that would have been a ruiner.  Pretty cool
  ending.  Saw it with Morag and her roommate Karen at World Porters
  in さくらぎちょう.</p>

<p>Today I rode my bike to work and took the train home (to the
  movies then home) so I'll get to ride it back tomorrow.  I hope the
  weather stays clear.</p>

<p>I'm hanging out slash calling みき too often to make it easy to not
  see her when janette comes.  Erg.  I think it will be easy enough
  for me but way unfair to her.</p>

<br>i salute you for thinking of how your actions will affect another. i am glad you can check your own desires out of kindness and consideration for another&rsquo;s welfare. that is the warrior part of you, ya?  and acting from kindness is good karma. things will work beautifully if you are wise and honest and kind.<br>
 i have to beleive that is true. <br></p>
