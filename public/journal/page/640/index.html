<p>KTRU was great fun today!  I recorded my show (recorded 2 hours of my 3
hour show) for Channing, a youth in Tulsa, who was really excited to
expand his musical awareness!  I think Side A is more musically
expanding&hellip;</p>

<p>But!!  The coolest thing:  A guy called in; &ldquo;Will you play something by
Squarepusher?&rdquo;  (I gave my standard non-committal answer; I didn&rsquo;t know
if I could find it).</p>

<p>I followed my guess to some hip hop LPs and saw Latyrx on one of the
sleeves.  &ldquo;Latyrx!  I saw them at the DJ Shadow concert!&rdquo;  Pulled it
out, and found misfiled in that sleeve, Squarepusher.  For real!  And
that was like 20 seconds after I hung up the phone with the guy who
requested it!</p>

<p>I cued it, played it, got a phone call from the same guy.  &ldquo;Thanks,
bro.  But you&rsquo;re playing it at the wrong speed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>DOH!  Sure enough, a large &ldquo;45&rdquo; was slowing spinning around at 33 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>
rpm.  &ldquo;Shall I change it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He said, &ldquo;nah; I&rsquo;ve never heard it at this speed before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I let the song complete its slow play, then relayed the funny rotation
speed story over the air and played a portion of it at the correct
speed.  &ldquo;So imagine what you just heard being played at this speed and
there you go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faded the song out, &ldquo;And here is Sonic Youth as Ciccone Youth playing
&lsquo;HI Everybody&rsquo;&rdquo; and doh!! I played it at the wrong speed!!!  Aaauhh!! I
fixed this one in within the first 10 seconds..</p>

<p>With Love
- Rob</p>

<p><p>The countdown continues.  I think that this year the New Year will not
be such a shock to me when it arrives since I&rsquo;ve been thinking about it SO
Much..  It won&rsquo;t sneak up on me.  I mean, jeez- I&rsquo;ve got a counter counting
down the seconds until the moment comes!</p>

<p><p>Today at work has been slow.  I am mostly waiting for our new computers
to come in so I can install Win NT 4.0 on them.  Maybe I should begin
reading about that process.</p>

<p><p>Because it&rsquo;s been so slow, I invited Channing to BBS Thingie, a web
based BBS not-realtime chat area that is quite remniscent of the lovely
Castle of Dreams.</p>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s at <a 
href="https://www.geeky-boy.com/cgi-bin/bbs_thingie"><a href="https://www.geeky-boy">https://www.geeky-boy</a><br />
.com/cgi-bin/bbs_thingie</a>.  If you come join us, feel free to say HI in
the Introduction area (a sub-item of Misc), or just run around all the
areas!</p>

<p><p>I think I mentioned that I purchased tickets to a rave on New Year&rsquo;s
Eve.  I got tix for myself and Wende.  She doesn&rsquo;t feel comfortable
attending on this particular night, so I have decided to sell the tickets
(not scalp them) at the door and just skate around downtown with Wende.  It
should still be lots of delightful fun watching the wild entertainment in
the streets.</p>

<p class=note>(transcribed from my diary)</p>

<p>Yesterday Fred and I rode his unicycle around more and tossed my new
frisbee-ish thing (collapseable hinged ring) and then I went home.  My
butt hurts from unicycling.</p>

<p>Today Channing IMed me and asked about KTRU.  After I told him all our
music types, he was all, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s Navrang?&rdquo;  I told him it was music from
India (but I&rsquo;m afraid even that might be wrong), and that&rsquo;s all I know.
Turns out he was able to listen on RealAudio, so I called Alison at the
station and requested some Navrang for him.</p>

<p>On the air, she prepended the song, &ldquo;this is for a request in Tulsa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Channing loved it!  He asked if I would tape a copy for him.  No sweat.</p>

<hr />

<p>Work was short and sweet (I ate a lot of chocolate) and we got paid
early (&ldquo;Just in case you might need the cash around Y2K&rdquo;).  Phat.  I
love my job!</p>

<p class=note>(transcribed from my diary)</p>

<p>Presents and cookies at Ma&rsquo;s in College Station then I surprised
everyone by arriving at Dad&rsquo;s in Magnolia.  Fred was there; he had
decided at the last minute to fly in to town (his plans at Berkeley fell
through).  I am so glad to have seen him unwrap the crazy gift!  He
required 1.3 hours to unwrap it.  Really.  That time does not include a
break for dinner.  I was quite pleased with my handiwork.</p>

<p>Fred was quite pleased with the gifts: a 2x2x2 Rubik&rsquo;s cube, and a small
wooden puzzle called TAKITAPART.  There is some historical significance
on the gifts:</p>

<pre><code>Fred now owns a 2x2x2 cube, a 3x3x3 cube, a 4x4x4 cube, and a 5x5x5
</code></pre>

<p>cube.<br />
    He can solve the 2x2x2 and 3x3x3 and <em>almost</em> the 4x4x4!
    He has no chance on the 5x5x5 yet.  But I trust he&rsquo;ll do it sometime
    in his life.</p>

<pre><code>The TAKITAPART is identical to a puzzle that our grandad (Ma's dad) had
back in the day.  Grandad had tons of puzzles.  Hundreds.  And we were
eventually able to solve them all.  Except this one.  Grandad could
solve it in about 10 seconds.  We have never figured it out.
-- So I got Fred the identical puzzle, and we were able to solve it in
about 30 minutes.  Turns out it's not the same puzzle.  It looks the
same, but is not actually the same.  Hmmm.
</code></pre>

<p>Fred and I did dishes after supper and then took his unicycle down to
the local elementary school to get a few practice runs on it.  I was
able to get about 20 feet, Fred more consistently about 30 feet.  We&rsquo;re
no experts, but getting better.  I expect he&rsquo;ll be able to ride it by
the time I see him again.
I am sure I will be envious.</p>

<p>We got freezing cold (40 F) so we back to the house we were talking some
BS when Fred mentioned that Karen (dad&rsquo;s new girlfriend) said she likes
all types of music.</p>

<p>HA!</p>

<p>So I called KTRU.  Curtis was there.  &ldquo;Hey Curtis, this is Rob.  Will
you play something off the CD <em>Japanese / American Noise
Treaty</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He said he would be happy to, so we made sure Karen and Dad could hear
the stereo.</p>

<p>Fred had never heard such noise and I joined him in eyewatering laughter
&ldquo;I like all music!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But even better: Curtis came back on after the song and said, &ldquo;that was
requested _________  a cover of _________.  It&rsquo;s a nice song; I like to
sing along with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As if.  Fred described the sound later as &ldquo;worse than static, cause at
least you can ignore static.&rdquo;  It&rsquo;s hard static with blown out screaming
and halts and it&rsquo;s just tough as hell.</p>

<p class=note>(transcribed from my diary)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m in College Station now after a candle light service at church.  (My
mom is a UU minister)  The service was full of carols and candles, but I
didn&rsquo;t feel much like participating; my nose was all snuffly and stuff.
It&rsquo;s not the same here without Fred.  Also conspicuously missing is
Karina, me an&rsquo; Fred&rsquo;s step sister, although Alicia is here (our other
step-sis), but she is not a boistrous as Karina.</p>

<p>Big stuff recently:</p>

<p>1) I am HIV negative
2) I switched our ISP at work (T1 to DSL)
3) We got nice Christmas bonuses at work $473, which ain&rsquo;t much,
   but a ton more than at Telecheck
4) I&rsquo;m in the process of moving my website to robnugen.com
5) Wende and I are exclusively dating
6) I&rsquo;m still climbing out of debt
7) Yahoo (YHOO) stock is going crazy up: $405/share now;
   I bought 5 at $209
8) I wrapped Fred&rsquo;s gift ridiculously tightly in some 20 layers
   of tape and cardboard and wrapping paper.</p>

<hr />

<p class=date>5am</p>

<p>Oh my goodness; I got up to P and Ma was awake, just chillin&rsquo; drinking
some hot tea.  We talked a bit and she got sleepy and then I was awake
so I started calling my credit card companies to see where exactly my
balances are.  Talked to Jennifer, who, for Christmas, removed $40
finance charge!!  My remaining balance was only $50 (it had been $3000,
but I transferred the balance to a different card) and I had her pay the
rest via phone, and <em>bang</em> the card is paid off!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m gonna send her a thank you note!</p>

<p>Wow.  3 days till Christmas; 10 days till 2000!!</p>

<p>Today at work I finalized purchase orders for three
machines!!  This is a first for me on this scale, and
with this level of precision piece by piece
construction.</p>

<p>The data server will be a dual PIII 500 mhz machine
with 256meg ram, four 9.1gig hard drives (scsi ultra
2, 10,000 rpm) arranged into a RAID 5 array with a hot
spare, single channel raid controller that can handle
15 physical drives, 8 gig tape backup, two NIC <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>100</sub>
cards, dual power supply in a big tower case with 12
drive bays, etc.</p>

<p>The web server will be dual PIII 600 mhz, 256 meg ram,
one 9.1gig hard drive, 8 gig tape backup, two NIC
<sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>100</sub> cards, etc.</p>

<p>These two machines will be their own little private
network, and also connected to our main hub.</p>

<p>The third machine is to replace a currently used
workstation that is getting pretty old and slow - it
can&rsquo;t even handle Win 98 quickly.  We&rsquo;ll get a PIII
500mhz, 128meg ram, 18.2 gig hard drive, one NIC
<sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>100</sub>, etc.</p>

<p>AND I&rsquo;ll get to install NT 4.0 on all these machines!</p>

<hr />

<p>Rosa is the gentle and polite woman who cleans up our
building each evening.  Talking to her today, we
wished each other happy holidays and stuff.  She is
just learning English, but tries hard to communicate.
I told her I learned a tiny bit of Spanish while in
Costa Rica last year, and somehow we got to the
subject of learning languages, but not knowing the
&ldquo;bad words.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some day,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am going to learn the bad
words. The <em>really</em> bad words.&rdquo;</p>

<p>=====================</p>

<p>Got home, watched the Simpsons with Spot purring
contentedly on my back.</p>

<p>Got a great package in the mail!  All the present I
ordered from Bits and Pieces for Maggie, Molly, John,
Will, Marcel, Fred and myself.  (I&rsquo;m not sure what to
get Wende).   So now Wende and I have just eaten
dinner at her house and we&rsquo;re about to wrap presents.
She works at The Container Store, so has cool rolling
scissors, cool tube shaped ribbon, and plain ol&rsquo; flat
wrapping paper.</p>

<p><p>Today I had a most cool day at work.  Mostly I researched/designed some new computers for work to be our new web server and its data server.  I was given a $10,000 limit for the two machines.  Nice.  The plan is to get the following:</p>

<pre>
web server:             data server:
dual PIII 600mhz        PIII 500mhz
256 meg ram             128 meg ram
13 gig ultra 2 scsi     RAID 5 using four 13 gig ultra 2 scsi on hotswappable backplane
8 gig tape backup       Adaptec controller with >= 64 meg cache
two NICs                8 gig tape backup
etc                     two NICs
                        etc
</pre>

<p><p>One pair of NICs (Network Interface Cards) will connect each machine to our hub.  The other pair will be used to connect the two machines into their own private network so they can talk super fast without bogging down our hub.</p>

<p><p>I don&rsquo;t have a price quote yet, but I should get that tomorrow early.  Nice!!!</p>

<p><p>Super special thanks to my homey John for giving me fine tune points on the RAID 5 setup, and on the NICs.</p>

<p><p><hr></p>

<p><p>In other news, I&rsquo;m all &ldquo;GRRrrr&rdquo; at a guy who was all, &ldquo;oh sure I&rsquo;ll do it&rdquo; and never did it, and over the past couple weeks I&rsquo;ve been cleaning up for him, and I just got an email from him, &ldquo;please finish up because January is my deadline.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m just pissed at him for not doing the work he said he would do in the first place.  No, .. not pissed, but more like disgusted at his lack of integrity.</p>

<p><p>(I&rsquo;m being purposely vague about the details of this, but I&rsquo;ll mention it has nothing to do with work.)</p>

<p><p><hr></p>

<p><p>In other news, I&rsquo;m trying to get emacs to save a macro for me to make journal writing easier.  I sent an email to my brother (at least I hope it actually sent (it was a pretty funny email)) asking him how to do it.</p>

<p><p><hr></p>

<p><p>Fewer than 900,000 seconds to year 2000!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p><p>Today at work, with significant help from David and Brian, we got all our DSL related problems solved, except we still can&rsquo;t send email.  Brian believes it&rsquo;s cause our ISP didn&rsquo;t set up our reverse-DNS-lookup tables.  We can ask for the IP address of a machine name, but not for the machine name of one of our IP addresses.</p>

<p><p>Then I helped Liz at <a href="https://www.blanketstoyou.com">Blankets To You</a> get set up on a new ISP.  Didn&rsquo;t actually get her set up yet, but began the process of getting her account created there.  She&rsquo;ll have a real shopping cart once it&rsquo;s complete!</p>

<p><p>Bought Taco Bell on the way home and met Wende at my house.  We ate and she talked about her day and then I went to Ultimate at 10:35pm.</p>

<p><p>Very few people showed up, and we spent about 40 minutes literally just standing in the parking lot, talking our geek/fireworks/D&amp;D/ultimate talk.  The temperature was deemed too cold so we caravaned to House of Pies.</p>

<p><p>Now I get to the point of my whole story.  I didn&rsquo;t have shoes.  Well I actually had sandals under my carseat, but I wanted to try something not outrageous, but memorable enough to get a good story out of it.</p>

<p><p>I pulled my sweatpants down just a little bit, and covered up my feet with them!</p>

<p><p>I appeared to be wearing pajamas with feet sewn into them, and got a few giggles or looks from various people and the waitstaff.  I felt a tad nervous that they would say something, but they didn&rsquo;t.  Yay!</p>

<p><p>Great coversation and I told a joke:</p>

<pre>
A priest, a minister and a rabbi walked into a bar.  
The bartender said, "what is this, some kind of joke?"
</pre>

<p><p>When I first wrote the joke to Rocky yesterday morning over AIM, I typed</p>

<pre>
A priest, a minister and a rabbit walked into a bar.  
The bartender said, "what is this, some kind of joke?"
</pre>

<p><p>I like this version even better!</p>

<p><p>Today is our big DSL switchover day at work.  Well, actually it will be
tonight.  Currently (until december 31st) we are paying for a full T1 line.
 But we are using an embarassingly small fraction of the line.  Tiny small.
 Average of 2kps with bursts as high as 200kps.  T1 is 1.5Mps, almost 1000
times more than our highest bursts.</p>

<p><p>Anyway, we are switching to DSL, with 416kps as our upper limit, for a
fraction of the cost.  1/7th of the cost.  wait 3/14ths of the cost.  yeah.</p>

<p><p>ANYWAY, I&rsquo;m getting to learn all kinds of new and cool stuff!  How to
set up a router; how to telnet to our routers to change their IP addresses.
 How to change all the IPs in our NT network.  How to change the IP in our
FreeBSD (unix) box.  How zone files direct all Internet traffic.  How to
change domain information on interNIC with networksolutions.com. How to
change the third level domain names of our machines.  Mine will be called
rabbit.</p>

<p><p>I love it!</p>

<p><p>Oh..  one weird thing:  I was testing IP switching on a relatively
unused machine, and noticed it had only 48 megs of memory.  I ripped out
some memory from a different entirely unused machine to see if that would
help.  (All the memory slots were full on the good machine, so I just
replaced a couple of chips to see if the available memory would go up or
down.  It went down to 40 megs.)</p>

<p><p>During this process, I noticed the power supply fan wasn&rsquo;t spinning.  I
tried to bring it back to life with a screwdriver (give the blades a push),
but it didn&rsquo;t work.  So I couldn&rsquo;t boost the memory, but I did give it a
new power supply!  Yay!</p>

<p>I logged 11 hours today, 9 of which go to DSL switchover.</p>

<p>Was not able to get the mail server happy.  We can receive email, but
not send it; the mail server thinks our new IP addresses are hackers
trying to use our server as a mail relay.  (This is a technique used
to spam people; our server won&rsquo;t allow it.)  I don&rsquo;t know where to add
our IP addresses and say, &ldquo;hey!  we have new IPs!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I also couldn&rsquo;t get our printers&rsquo; IPs changed.  After I changed all
the computer IPs, I realized I had forgotten the printers.  I couldn&rsquo;t
telnet to them because the IPs were different; so I called Brian who
suggested connecting it directly to my computer (I&rsquo;d have to change my
IPs back to old IPs first) but I couldn&rsquo;t get that to work.  Pooh.</p>

<p>Sweet and Wonderful Wende brought dinner over at around 9pm; we ate
and talked for an hour then she slept on the couch until I could no
longer think coherently.  Bed bed bed.</p>

<p>With Love
