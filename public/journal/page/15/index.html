circle as a guest magician.  It was really great to see his
facilitation, and to see how closely it meshes with what we have
already been doing.</p>

<p>Today Lin and I drove to Travis and Yumi&rsquo;s place to hang out with them
and Sakura.  Johan was already there and Deji came a bit later.  Nice
to see everyone again, though in some ways it&rsquo;s like the tribe is
getting smaller (and larger!)</p>

<p>No BBQ today due to rain, but we made 手巻き with chicken, eggs,
salad, and then ice cream at the end.</p>

<p>We laughed a lot, played with (funny) rubber balls, retrieved toys
from under the sofa set, and had a great time.</p>

<p>Peeps were ready to leave by the time I had to leave to get to men&rsquo;s
circle on time tonight, so Lin drove us to the station.  Driving a car
takes (unpredictably) longer than taking a train, so I took a train.</p>

<p>Deji and I sat on Yokohama line for a bit, talking about what racism
actually means.  He made a distinction between &ldquo;pre judging&rdquo; (making
predictions about someone) and &ldquo;prejuduce&rdquo; (assuming superiority over
someone).</p>

<p>Today we got our bicycle parking passes, which we applied for in
June 2016.  I bought a 3 month pass.  Lin got 1 month because she is
less certain she will like riding more than walking/bussing because of
the hills between our place and the station.</p>

<p>I figure 3 months will give me a pretty good sense of how much I like
biking to the station (bicycle parking area).</p>

<p>Near the end of my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tlb7LvQ71D0">Marble Track 3 Construction Animation livestream
for today</a>, I got a well meaning comment from the gloriously named <strong>FE4R
Fart1oncheese</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>7:55 AM FE4R Fart1oncheese​ dude

7:55 AM FE4R Fart1oncheese​ sorry but no one is going to watch
this. Not tryna be mean, im just saying

7:56 AM FE4R Fart1oncheese​ you might not wanna stream this because
people are going to make fun of you
</code></pre>

<p>No doubt about that!  But I assured him the livestreams were not to be
viewed so much as to be a timer showing how long I have worked on
Marble Track 3.  Approximately 318 hours as of now.</p>

<ul>
<li>Lately I&rsquo;ve been saying &ldquo;see you next era&rdquo; in Japanese just do draw
attention to the fact that the era is going to change on May 1st.</li>
</ul>

<p>We&rsquo;ve got a big pack of days off coming this Golden Week: 10!  Most of
my students are glad, but there are some people who are like wtf
because schools and day care will be closed, but the parents (in
service sector jobs) have to work.</p>

<p>I do <em>not</em> have to work, but am not full time so it means no money for
a week, but should be okay.  Sad and shame that a week without pay
would even be a blip in my mind.</p>

<ul>
<li>I just created a new Meetup for the men&rsquo;s circle.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.meetup.com/ManKind-Project-Tokyo/events/260931056/">Journey of the Heart, a deep honest look at your life</a></p>

<p>How far in advance should I have started promoting?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I have started taking Japanese classes again, and started looking
into language exchange again.  I had not done language exchange for
a while because it always ended up unbalanced (imo) toward English.
One Japanese man would even speak German during the Japanese
side. Anyway, I am trying again.</p></li>

<li><p>I have attended badminton twice with Tomoko et.al.  It&rsquo;s quite a fun
group and gives me the chance to speak in Japanese (definitely
unbalanced toward Japanese!!)  The same group is planning to go to a
baseball game on June 30th (2+ months away), so maybe that gives me
an idea of how far in advance I need to schedule stuff.</p></li>

<li><p>I have started looking at Gatsby again to see if I can figure out
how to use it for <a href="https://www.marbletrack3.com/">Marble Track 3</a>
website.  I wonder if I should just pay that guy who suggested it.
$4000 seems like a lot but could be worth it.</p></li>

<li><p>I need to make some changes to AB website today or this weekend: add
a new field (lmhs-type) to one of the primary tables. I think I
should have had them done before, but I hate to should on myself.</p></li>

<li><p>Delayna has sent me several Marco Polo messages, but I have not
listened to them yet.</p></li>

<li><p>Lin has started her new job and enjoys the benefits of being full
time, but does not necessarily like the long hours.  She apparently
met someone internet-famous though, so that&rsquo;s interesting.</p></li>

<li><p>Our cat Jennie is fine, enjoying warmer weather, and waking up at
4:40am to go outside.  She lets Lin know it&rsquo;s time be stepping on
Lin&rsquo;s face.</p></li>

<li><p>I am excited about Robert Golden coming to Tokyo.  I met him in
Hawaii and in a nice synchronicity had previously learned he would
be coming to Japan to see his son during the aptly named Golden
Week.</p></li>

<li><p>I have been reading and practicing learnings from The Power of Now,
and Law of Attraction.  Quite interesting new ways to think about
stuff and wonder at the physics behind the scenes.</p></li>

<li><p>314 or so hours of <a href="https://www.marbletrack3.com/episode/">Marble Track 3 livestreams</a></p></li>

<p>Today has seemed busy; my brain was spinning with what to do next for
a while this morning.  I ended up creating a new Part entry for Marble
Track 3 (tssfobls) before attending men&rsquo;s group meeting (Integration
Group Council).</p>

<p>Now I am on the way back from Tokyo station where I met Tariq and Jon
(for different reasons).  Tariq about ConSwi, and Jon to give him a
bag he left at our house.</p>

<p>I will hopefully be in time at home to attend Japanese lesson with
Mana at 3pm.  ギリギリかな。</p>

<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19717320">My reply</a>, copied below:</p>

<p>TL;DR: not making money yet, but enjoying stop motion animation of marble track construction.</p>

<p>Back in the day, my brother and I would use Legos to build tracks for marbles, using roof pieces as ramps.  Eventually I started making marble tracks out of popsicle sticks. Over a period of some years, I built a track 2+ feet (70cm) tall with lots of tracks intertwining each other all the way down.</p>

<p>After moving and leaving that old track behind, I made Marble Track 2 over an eight-month period in my free time at work.</p>

<p>I posted the finished track on YouTube[1] and comments fell into 2 categories.</p>

<p>Trolls: U suck, it&rsquo;s garbage, get a gf, etc.</p>

<p>Fans: U rule, it&rsquo;s amazing, make a tutorial, etc.</p>

<p>Me: &ldquo;Make a tutorial?  about how to make a marble track??  hmmmm that gives me an idea!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So far, I have about 11 minutes[2] worth of (silent) video of little pipe cleaner characters placing wooden pieces onto a stage.  They are answering the question &ldquo;how do you make a marble track?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The project has its own website[3], which reinforces the story that the characters are building the track.</p>

<p>(fake spoiler)
However, it&rsquo;s actually me behind the scenes moving the characters to make the movie in which they build the track!</p>

<p>300+ hours of livestream[4] answer the question &ldquo;how do you make a stop motion movie which answers the question of how to make a marble track?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The livestreams are long, dull, often quiet, interspersed with a few ramblings that go through my head.</p>

<p>So, back on track (ahem) for this thread, I believe there are people who&rsquo;d be interested in this project, and eventually we will figure out how it can be monetized.  I am just enjoying the creation process and open to possibilities.</p>

<p>One of my Japanese teachers had suggested learning through songs, so I
have decided to learn this song (found by searching &ldquo;Japanese songs
learning&rdquo; or something)</p>

<p>Hmmm it is pretty easy.</p>

<p>This one is way more challenging for me, but I learned the refrain
ages (15 years?) ago.</p>

<br />ああ　感じてる
<br />その時なの　もしもし君たち　帰りなさいと

<br />愛しているよと　連発銃が
<br />私を殺してしまいそう　ああ　負けそうよ
<br />都会の空では　奇跡のような
<br />星空ひろがる　夏の夜
<br />ああ　夢みたい
<br />その時なの　もしもし君たち　帰りなさ いと
<br />夢からうつつに戻されたのよ　アアア

<p>Hilarious!  I just re-read her suggestion and realize she said &ldquo;learn
this <em>like</em> a song&rdquo;   I ready it as &ldquo;learn something like a <em>song</em>&ldquo;</p>

<pre><code>For your homework, it would be great if you could review these
sentences so I can test you on them in the next lesson.
My homework style is:
1) Listen a lot, and remember the sentences like the lyrics of a song.
2) When you remembered the sounds in that way, you’ll get curious about the meaning of the sentences.
3) Look at the explanations I send you and study the meaning
4) Even if there are kanji that you can’t read, you’ll be able to read
the sentences because you remembered the pronunciation first

It’s a very simple, but totally effective method! If you remember
the sounds like song lyrics, your pronunciation will also get more
native-like, and you’ll be able to construct natural-sounding
sentences just by swapping out single words.
</code></pre>

<p>Here is my first transcription of what she sent in audio form.</p>

<p>THIS JAPANESE IS FULL OF ERRORS (any correct Japanese is a fluke; do
not use this for mission critical software):</p>

<p>こじんのいしはそんちょういなければならない
きらくにけいよ大丈夫
<ruby><rb>全</rb><rt>全</rt></ruby>てうまくいくさ
ひかんてきな人生かんをすてて
前向きたいどをすでにもすずけお
生まれた国せべつ心情にかんけなく
誰に対しても公平でなくてはならない
びょうどうはけんぽでまもられている
彼ははしによりかかって自由をまがめぞうおちと見つめた
こうすいのほのかおり</p>

<p>Lin and I enjoyed a great productive day today, starting with a romp
after calling my mom on voip.</p>

<p>Main things for me: work on AB, fix bicycles.  Lin wanted to clean the
house a bit so she did that while I worked on AB.</p>

<p>We walked our decrepit bicycles to a local shop.  Mine had to get a
new chain; Lin&rsquo;s bicycle needed a new valve stem and new seat.</p>

<p>While the bicycles were being fixed, we walked to the station to get a
case for Lin&rsquo;s new work phone.   Walked back to the bicycle shop and
road our renewed rides back home.</p>

<p>Great progress in terms of frames today.  Got the Triple Splitter
Small Feeder Inner Bar curved and have a plan for Pinky to go push the
Medium Blue Marble up the track on the Caret Splitter side of things.</p>
