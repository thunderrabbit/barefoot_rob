<p><p class=date>Saturday, May 23, 1992 10:52 PM.</p>

<p><p>Today I worked at Kroger until 6PM.  I got to be on the express
register because of my surgery.  That was cool.  When I got home,
Maggie had made some sweet &amp; sour beef.  It was excellent.  Then she
and John went to his <em>Bilby&rsquo;s Doll</em> opera, in which he plays
french horn in the orchestra.  I went over and helped Bruce paint
Hal&rsquo;s apartment and Susan&rsquo;s apartment for 3.5 hours.  Now I&rsquo;ve helped
him 5.5 hours total.  He said I&rsquo;ll get 8 bucks per hour, so thats $44
off my rent this time around.  Cool.</p>

<p><p>Forest called today.  He&rsquo;s leaving (for real) for California.  He
says he still loves me and that he&rsquo;s running from me.  Pretty weird if
you ask me.  Anyway, he won&rsquo;t give me his address, so that takes a
load off my head.. Right now I don&rsquo;t really care if I never hear from
him again.</p>

<p><p>Maggie and John should be home from the opera soon.  Cool.  We
might go out to Marble Slab.  That&rsquo;s about it.  Later</p>

<p><p class=date>11:50 same night</p>

<p><p>Maggie &amp; John just got back from the opera thing.  I was sleeping.
I hugged Maggie as she got some candy out of the fridge.  I walked
down there with Maggie and John and Maggie got into the truck with her
TCSC box in her lap.  I gave her a hug and kissed her hair against her
neck as I inhaled one last breath of Maggie for the rest of the
summer.  (I also caressed her leg.)  &ldquo;Drive carefully and call me&rdquo; I
said.  &ldquo;See you in the fall,&rdquo; said John.  &ldquo;Ok. Bye-Bye&rdquo; replied Maggie
in the voice only she can produce.  Fuck.  I nearly died of loneliness
over Christmas vacation.  What am I going to do for the whole summer?</p>

<p><p class=date>10:27 AM</p>

<p><p>I made it.  I&rsquo;m on my way home right now.  I wrote down some notes,
which I&rsquo;ll transcribe here.  At first I was upset about the fact that
I was listed for general anesthesia.  I did <em>not</em> want that.
So when the anesthesiologist came to talk with me, I told her.  She
said in a very comforting voice, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s fine. No problem,&rdquo; as she lay
her hand on my arm.  I felt better at that.  So they wheeled me into
the operating room and got to work.  I got EKG patches on my (4 of
them, one on each shoulder and one on each side of my stomach) and a
pulse monitor on my finger.  Dr Bonefas came in and I said, &ldquo;HI!&rdquo;
using my &ldquo;Oh-my-gosh-you-are-so-beautiful&rdquo; voice.  She said HI and
said she was going to shave my breast.  At my request, she shaved both
of them.  The anesthesiologist said, &ldquo;he only wants local anesthesia.&rdquo;
and Dr Bonefas said &ldquo;Yeah this guy wants to be awake.&rdquo;  Cool.  So they
gave me a tiny bit of a relaxer via IV.  Throughout the procedure, I
felt about as tired as I would at 4 or 5AM after staying out at the
dorms all day.  I was fairly talkative; one of the nurses said I would
feel awake, but that I wouldn&rsquo;t remember what I had said afterward,
but I do remember a lot.  Before they started cutting, I asked, &ldquo;any
bets on what color it will be?&rdquo;  Dr. bonefas said matter of factly &ldquo;It
will be yellow.&rdquo;  Oh Dr. Jeffrey Meynig was the resident assisting
Dr. Bonefas.  I asked that Dr Bonefas give me a running commentary of
the procedure since they wouldn&rsquo;t let me watch.  She did.  She told me
what I might feel as she injected the local anesthesia.  Then she told
me she was going to do the incision.  I didn&rsquo;t feel anything.  She
pulled the skin of the nipple back and I could feel the tugging
sensation.  Someone made a comment about my hair, and I told them that
I keep it cut short, and that whichever girl cuts my hair gets to
choose how long it will be.  They asked, &ldquo;at the barber shop?&rdquo;  I
said, &lsquo;no way,&rsquo; and I told them about Maggie living with me this week
and that she cut it.</p>

<p><p>I asked what my pulse was, and they said 80 bpm.  I told them it
was 56 before the surgery.  They were(?) mildly impressed by that.
(I&rsquo;m so so tired suddenly. I&rsquo;m going to keep writing thought &ldquo;Crazy
for you&rdquo; by Madonna is on.  It&rsquo;s 11:50AM Maggie &amp; John are trying to
revive her hard drive, which has crashed)  I wiggled my finger and
messed up the pulse taker.  The cauterized the cut with what sounded &amp;
felt like sparks.  Cool.  That kinda hurt, so Dr Bonefas gave me some
more numbing injection.  Then she sewed it up and showed me the lump.
It was about teh size of a shooter marble.  It looked reddish to me-
maybe that was just blook, but it didn&rsquo;t exactly look yellow to me.
I&rsquo;ll ask her later.</p>

<p><p>They wheeled me back to recovery; on the way out, I said sincerely
&ldquo;Thanks Dr. Bonefas.&rdquo;  I was happy.  Oh- they also showed me the
nipple before they covered it.  It was flat.  In recovery, I read the
nurse&rsquo;s description of what happened.  She also said it went well.  At
9AM, the guy who was going to wheel me back upstairs was saying, &ldquo;this
guy&rsquo;s reading- he&rsquo;s ready to go - he could probably walk upstairs&rdquo;
Oh- just after the operation, I asked Dr Bonefas to sign the EKG thing
that was on my right shoulder.  She signed &amp; dated it.  Very cool.</p>

<p><p>I wore that and a thermometer (a mood ring thermometer, as I said
during surgery) out.  (The thermometer was (is) on my forehead.)  Not
anymore. heh heh.  I kept the guy who wheeled me upstairs relatively
entertained with my thermometer and EKG stories.  Once I got to my
room, I asked a lady in there if I could borrow a pen so that I could
write this down on a scratch paper.  I have just now transcribed it to
here, filling in where necessary.  He was cool, and even got me an
oxygen mask since I didn&rsquo;t use one while down there.  Then Tammy
brought me home and here I am.  I&rsquo;m going to sleep now.</p>

<p><p class=date>Wednesday, May 20th 1992 (Same day) 10PM</p>

<p><p>I told Warner at work today about my letter in the mail.  He said
it was probably a scam, but wished me good luck.  He said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
believe it when I see it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Maggie cooked the turkey that I had in the freezer.</p>

<p><p class=date>12:05AM</p>

<p><p>Molly just called.  That was fun.  We put her on speakerphone and
made jokes about sex and what me and Maggie have (not) done together.
Speaking of Maggie,</p>

<p><p class=message>Hellody!</p>

<p><p class=message>I get to write in Rob&rsquo;s Journal&hellip; I get to write in
Rob&rsquo;s Journal!  My hand writing is really bad tonight (sorry).  Rob,
you&rsquo;ve asked me to write some of my thoughts in here.  Here&rsquo;s what
I&rsquo;ve got to say: (We got interrupted, it&rsquo;s 1:25 now)</p>

<p><p class=message>I appreciate so much that Rob has let me stay with
him this week.  I did not want to stay at anyone else&rsquo;s place for one
reason or another.  I am so thankful to have Robert as my friend; I
can&rsquo;t even say.  He is great to me.  He helps me study and relax and
do work (carry papers).  He helped me move in at Christmas, out at
Christmas and out this very May.  He&rsquo;s done me more favors than I can
possibly repay and I am very thankful.  Not only is all this true, but
he&rsquo;s polite and doesn&rsquo;t pressure me to do anything but be true to
myself.</p>

<p><p class=message>Yes, Robert.  You have all this to your name and all
packaged in a body qui serais un ecureil tris mignon.</p>

<p><p class=message align=right>- Maggie (1:31 am)</p>

<p><p class=date>10PM (same day) Thursday May 21, 1992.</p>

<p><p>Today I went to Dr. Descant and he said to cut my lump out.  So
tomorrow at 6:30 AM I&rsquo;ll be at the hospital.  The surgery is scheduled
fro 7:30 AM.  I&rsquo;m going to BEG Dr. Bonefas for local anesthesia; I
want to watch her cut it out.  Maggie said I should get a cam-corder
and record the event for later viewing.  Heh heh.</p>

<p><p>Tammy is going to drive me to and from the hospital tomorrow, and
if I feel OK in the afternoon, I&rsquo;ll have an open-house stitches
viewing party.  Cool.  There was something else, but I don&rsquo;t
remember.  later.</p>

<p><p class=date>10:45AM, Wednesday, May 20th 1992.</p>

<p><p>Today I got some mail out of my mail box: &ldquo;Congratulations Mr Robert
Nugen, You hav won at least one of the following prizes:&rdquo; Cool!  So I
called the 800 number and gave them 4 security numbers.  Anyway. I
have guaranteed won a Nishika 3-D camera ($330) and 14 Karat gold
jewelry ($680) and (2) two of the following six prizes:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>1992 Chrysler Lebaron or $10,000 cash (I chose cash)

<p><li>4 Round trip airfares for 2 people: NY, Boston (Kiera!), LA,
San Fransico

<p><li>$2,000 cash

<p><li>3 Round trip tickets for 2 people Orlando, Lake Tahoe, Las Vegas

<p><li>$1,500 cash

<p><li>32 inch TV or $1,500 cash (I chose cash)
</ul>

<p><p>Dude! I also will receive a 5 year membership with the Platinum
Card = 50% off hotels and such and trips to (Freeport Bahamas and
(Alcapulco or Cancun)).</p>

<p><p>Ultimate!  However, I had to let them charge 698.50 to my VISA
account.  If I don&rsquo;t win the cash, I&rsquo;ll sell the tickets.  If I win
only tickets, I&rsquo;ll go see Kiera in Boston (definately) and sell the
rest (probably).  Right now I&rsquo;m going to Nationsbank (NCNB) to apply
for a loan for $2000 for my computer.  Later.</p>

<p><p>Monday I worked 2-8:30 then I helped Bruce paint Susan Conte&rsquo;s
apartment.  That was cool, since she is the lead singer of the band
<em>Eyes and Ears</em>.  She gave me one of their CD&rsquo;s.  Dude.  It has
6 songs on it, which I played straight through twice last night while
doing dishes.</p>

<p><p>After Maggie &amp; I went to bed, Tammy called all upset at about 2AM
because she coudln&rsquo;t bear to have sex with a guy she had been making
out with.  I told her there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that, and that she
was fine the way she is and not to worry about it.  Maggie lay awake
while I talked to Tammy and after I hung up with Tammy, Maggie said I
did a good job with Tammy.  I really appreciated that support from
Maggie.</p>

<p><p>This morning, (Debra) work called &amp; asked if I could come in for
Emilio at noon.  I told them I would come in as soon as possible after
my Dr appt at 10:30.</p>

<p><p>Speaking of which, it&rsquo;s 10:15 and I&rsquo;m going to see Dr Bonefas about
my breast lump.  It will be cool if she cuts it out.  Later</p>

<p><p class=date>12:18 AM, Monday, May 17, 1992</p>

<p><p>Maggie is here with me to help with this entry.  On Friday, we
moved the rest of Maggie&rsquo;s stuff just before work, during which time
Marcel and I did our Hans and Frans imitation.  They are 2 body
building characters on Saturday Night Live.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Hans&rdquo; &ldquo;Und I&rsquo;m
Frans.&rdquo;  unison: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re here to move..&rdquo; <CLAP> &ldquo;You out!&rdquo;  &ldquo;Hey Hans,
do you need some help with that single sheet of paper?  I know it must
be very heavy for you.&rdquo;  &ldquo;No. I could carry all of these boxes with
one pinky.&rdquo; etc etc.  Fun stuff.  Then I went to work.  Then I came
back to the dorms at about 9PM.  Molly &amp; Kris were nowhere.  Maggie &amp;
Eric &amp; Marcel had gone to see Split Second.  So I simply helped
different people move.  I helped Casey and a girl named Salena (sp)
move some stuff.  Salena is tall and smart &amp; funny and wears no
shoes.  Cool.  At one point I was eating some Thin Mints in exchange
for moving boxes and I was dancing around.  Salena looked at me
(accurately) as if I was crazy.  I told her that cookies make me
dance.  She gave me a raised-eyebrow intrigued look and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
remember that.&rdquo;  We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

<p><p>After a while, I met up with Molly and Kris and Greg.  Kris did not
flirt with me as much as she did the previous night, but I didn&rsquo;t
mind.  I knew that I shouldn&rsquo;t expect anything from her necessarily.
After another while, we (Molly, Kris, Greg &amp; I) were headed for House
of Pies.  While driving out of the parking lot, we caught up with
Maggie Eric &amp; Marcel.  So <em>All</em> of us went for the official
last House of Pies trip of the semester.  It was fun, but kind of
sad.  I&rsquo;m going to miss that this summer.  After House of Pies, Maggie
&amp; I got her shelves from her room and then drove her to my house.  We
talked about nothing and tentatively planned our week.</p>

<p><p>The next morning (Saturday) I went to Kroger from 8AM to 4PM. I
might get to do some stuff on the computer there.  Cool.</p>

<p><p>After work, Maggie &amp; I went with Heather and Pierre shopping for
groceries.  Maggie paid for it in exchange for getting to spend the
week here.  Heh heh. I get the best of both worlds!  Free food and
Maggie for a week!  We also went to Sound warehouse where I bought a
CD of Blondie for the song &ldquo;French Kissing in the U.S.A.&rdquo; and Duran
Duran <em>RIO</em>. Cool.  We also rented and watched DarkMan at
Heather&rsquo;s.  After the movie, (John came over right at the end of the
movie) I rubbed Heather&rsquo;s feet and back for a while, while Pierre
played computer and John &amp; Maggie giggled &amp; licked eachother.
Actually, Maggie would lick John&rsquo;s cheek just to see his reaction.
Then Maggie, John &amp; I went to my house and then John went home.  I was
darn tired and slept soundly until work.  I got off work at 6:PM
(Kroger) and then came home to Maggie &amp; tuna casseole.  My dad came
over and swapped the van, whose brakes need to be fixed, for Fred&rsquo;s
Volkswagon bug, whose everything needs to be fixed.  Then Maggie &amp; I
played the Truth portion of Truth or Dare.  She asked what was the
kinkiest thing I had ever done.  I told her about Tammy sticking the
frozen table knife handle up my ass while I jacked off laying on my
back on her kitchen table at her Stillwater house.  We talked until
John came over and he ate and then left at bout Midnight.</p>

<p><p>Yesterday Maggie asked me, &ldquo;so, Rob, does it turn you on to see
Mickey crawling on me?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I laughed.  She laughed.  After a while I told her that it doesn&rsquo;t
turn me on any more than just her standing there.  so she said, &ldquo;How
does this turn you on?&rdquo; and basically grabbed me and started to french
me.  I was more than willing to return the kiss, so I moved us to my
bed, where we rolled around and kissed for a good half hour.
<em><b>NOT!</b></em> Heh heh.  just kidding.  We didn&rsquo;t kiss.  Really.</p>

<p><p>Tomorrow we plan to do laundry and then buy a rat for Mickey, and
John will come watch him eat it with us.  Later</p>

<p><p class=date>3AM Friday</p>

<p><p>God! I didn&rsquo;t realize it was this late.  Today I went out to the
dorms and played frisbee with Marcel &amp; helped people move out and
watched the Simpsons.  Before that, Molly, Kris and I went to Pizza
Hut for pizza. I massaged Kris&rsquo; foot while we were eating.  They were
both sitting across from me and I got Kris to put her foot beside me
&amp; I took her shoe off and rubbed her foot.  At one point, after the
Simpson&rsquo;s, Kris and I were suddenly alone in the hallway and we
started to french kiss for about a minute.  Cool.  We all went to
House of Pies and ate.  Kris paid more attention to Greg than to me,
but I didn&rsquo;t let it bug me at all.  We got back to the dorms and then
I left.  Kris walked me out and we made out for about 3 minutes
including crotch rubbing (through shorts) (her crotch on my leg) (and
a little pelvis grinding) and me pinching her nipples.  At the end,
she said she wished it could continue, but she needed to get back.  So
she walked back and I drove home and jacked off and then wrote this.</p>

<p><p>Oh- also today, Tammy moved her shit out and Jodi &amp; Maggie &amp; Molly
(&amp; Jeanine via Molly) Moved stuff into here.  Jodie&rsquo;s stereo &amp; Greg&rsquo;s
refrigerator, which is by my bed now.  Maggie is going to move in
tomorrow for 1 week.  Ultimately cool.  I also bought 2 CD&rsquo;s.  Wayne&rsquo;s
World Soundtrack and Siouxsie &amp; the Banshees Peepshow.  I have to work
&ldquo;tomorrow&rdquo; until 8:30PM, but I&rsquo;ll be back out to say &ldquo;HI.&rdquo; after that.
I will be at Kroger work on Saturday until 4PM, and most of them will
be gone after that.  Sigh&hellip;. I&rsquo;m going to miss everyone.  Later - Rob</p>

<p><p class=date>5AM Wednesday, May 13, 1992</p>

<p><p>Dude &ldquo;today&rdquo; was the last day of finals for me.  At 8AM, Heather &amp;
I studied over here for a while before class at 11AM.  11AM was my
Assembly Language final.  I did Ok on it most likely.  After that was
my Physics III final.  I also did well on it.  I didn&rsquo;t study one inch
for either of them.</p>

<p><p>Today, Molly &amp; Maggie&rsquo;s friend, Kris, came to visit from Illinois
until Saturday.  Cool.  She and I flirted a lot.  Everyone went to
Star Pizza today after finals.  Everyone = Me, Maggie, John, Jeanine,
Greg, Molly, Kris, Heather, &amp; Pierre.  That was cool.  Then we went to
the dorms and played card games.  Pouce, Cancellation Hearts &amp; Nuclear
War.  Then we all went to House of Pies.  We all = Me, Laura, Jeaning,
Kris, Molly, MArcel, Steve, Judy, &amp; Greg.  Then we came back to the
dorms.  On the way to House of Pies, I was in the back seat with Kris
and I nibbled her ear a bit and nibbled the back of her neck.  When we
got back, she blew/nibbled my ear and gave me an &lsquo;eargasm&rsquo;.  Cool.
Right in front of Laura &amp; Molly, &amp; Jeanine, too.  Then at the very
end, Kris was on Molly&rsquo;s bed and I was on the bean bag with Molly.
Kris said, &ldquo;come let me blow your ear again.&rdquo;  So I agreeably jumped
up and lay down to let Kris do my ears.  After a while, we were just
laying there, and she said, &ldquo;well, if you&rsquo;re going to fall asleep,
come get under the covers.&rdquo;  So I did.  We cuddled for a few minutes
until Laura told me that she&rsquo;d prefer if I left.  I figured Laura was
probably right, so I did.  I gave Kris a hug and told her simply,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you later.&rdquo;  Molly walked out with me, and she &amp; I went to
Jeanine&rsquo;s for a while.  We talked about nothing and I gave Jeanine a
back massage.  At about 4:30AM I told them I had to go to bed, so I
gave Jeanine big major hugs, since she&rsquo;ll be goen (today) tomorrow
while I&rsquo;m at work.</p>

<p><p>Also today, I bought my SEX Madonna shirt from Kim for $6.00.  I
love it.  On the front it has Madonna wearing next to nothing and it
says &ldquo;S E X&rdquo; on it.  On the back, it has her again and it says &ldquo;sex
and Malice&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m going out with Lucy tomorrow (today) after work and
I&rsquo;ll be back at the dorms on Thursday. Later (5-13-92 5:25AM)</p>
