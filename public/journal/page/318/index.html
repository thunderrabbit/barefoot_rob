<p>I'm not really good at playing Grand Theft Auto 3, but I found that
I can stand on cars which will subsequently drive around the city with
me standing on them.  Some cars drive more aggressively than others,
so my character will get jostled off, but some are stable enough that
I can just ride around until there's a car-ramming traffic jam
resulting in over jostleage.</p>

<p>I thought it would be a cool thing to ride around up there and
shoot things, like in a particularly sweet (if by sweet I mean
violent) scene in _Swordfish_ starring John Travolta.</p>

<p>I looked up <a
href="https://www.ps2-cheats-codes-games.net/GTA3_Cheats.htm">cheats</a>
for the game and found All Weapons. But I'm not able to aim (I don't
know if it's my lack of skills with the game, or if it just can't be
done from on top of a car) and shoot up stuff like I'd hoped.</p>

<p>I'm crying in public now.  Not like bwuahh I'm a big fucking baby
crying, but tears and sniffles; I just want a friend in Japan.  It's
like I'm begging for friends cause I was walking back toward Shibuya
with Ayana and she had to stop to get pics and I'm like, "can I wait
for you?"  "No that's okay" "<em>May</em> I wait for you?"  "No, don't
worry."  Fuckin' hell I just want to talk with you for two minutes
longer.  Anything, please.</p>

<p>I'm broken hearted emotionally and have a hard time studying by
myself; I immerse myself in email and journaling and making to do
lists and don't study.  And then I'm happy to just talk to Ayana (pay
for friendship) because anything that looks like studying results in
my embarassment that I've not studied, but I can't study cause my mind
is awash in emotional distress from not having a friend.  It's a
vicious circle with no apparent end.</p>

<p>So I look to Nova students for friendship which I'm not allowed to
do by Nova's rules.  Most of the teachers have fun by going out and
smoke and drink.  The closest friend I've got is Cory, but he's
married practically to Janis</p>

<p>wah wah wah I'm a big fucking baby</p>

<p>My closest shot was Stephanie; but then she had to leave before we
really had time to hang out.  Didn't even really say Bye to her, just
"see you tomorrow" but tomorrow came with no Stephanie at work, and
the next day and then the next day she texted me, "I'm sick I'm outta
here."</p>

<p>Nami is so busy with work she never (*) emails me back</p>

<p>I've got myself so busy with shit that I never (*) give myself a
chance to cry nor hang out blah blah blahb albhablabhabl</p>

<p>(*) almost</p>

<p>In positive news, I have just been contacted by a cat who</p>

<p>Taking a taxi home from work because our beloved Tokyu line had an
accident (read suicide). Cory has never seen our line stopped due to
an accident before.   We've both seen the train late before, but not
flat stopped.</p>

<p class=date>10:37pm</p>

<p>I found out that the train hit a car at Jiyugaoka (sp).  Yeouch.</p>

<p>I cried today after class with Ayana.  I cried a bit on the way to
work, and cried a bit when I first got to work.  Morag came in, "how
are you?"  "sad."  and I told her I felt like I don't have any friends
in Japan.  She said that she was my friend, didn't that count?  and I
was like, "yes, totally," and a bit later she was all, "oh, I don't
want you to be sad."  and I said "sometimes I just need to be sad."
And she was all, "okay" and it was all cool.  Tears a bit longer and
she acknowledged that it sucked being alone (for her to be in Scotland
all alone) and she described (mirrored) what I'm experiencing here:
though I feel like I don't have friends, I've got to fix up my
emotions before I can feel like hanging out with anyone to make
friends with them.</p>

<p>I felt a lot better after crying.</p>

<p>WOW!</p>

<p>We just had a premium earthquake.</p>

<p>I felt it before Frank or Peter.</p>

<p>"Earthquake dude."</p>

<p>There was vertical bububububu up and down for a few seconds and
then wubbawubbawubba back and forth, with the hanging lampshades
swinging gently and the door moving back and forth and even the US and
English flags shaking on the TV.</p>

<p>"We're on the ground floor and this shit is shaking.  This ain't no
building swaying; this is ground floor kinda shit."</p>

<p>Really happy to have been on the ground floor for this one.</p>

<p>I wonder specifics on its origin.</p>

<pre>
TOKYO: A moderately strong earthquake with a preliminary magnitude 5
shook buildings in downtown Tokyo on Wednesday afternoon. There was no
immediate word of damage or injuries.

There was no worry of tsunamis, potentially dangerous waves triggered
by seismic activity, the Meteorological Agency said.

The quake was centered just northeast of Japan's capital in Chiba
state about 50 miles below the earth's surface, the agency said.
  
Chiba prefectural police spokesman Yoshio Nakadai said there was
vertical shaking for several seconds, but no immediate reports of
damage or injuries.
  
Public broadcaster NHK reported that bullet trains departing Tokyo
were suspended due to a power outage to the rail system. There was no
word about power outages elsewhere in the city of 12 million people.

suitcases.  "Nightmare" about 20 times describes their mass.</p>

<p>Says Cambodia is ridiculously poor.  Thailand seemed rather safe.
Viet Nam was scariest.  I could get a job on the same day I rock up
there.</p>

<p>I've got this perfect to do list, and on the list is hang out with
Frank, and the weather is nice so I want to go to Yomiuriland, which
would probably mean not hang out with Frank..   The problem seems to
be I want to go to Yomiuriland because "wow, rollercoasters, fun fun
fun" and for Frank I don't want to "miss anything," as he'll be here
only one day.   Oh pooh.</p>

<p>I don't know if YUL is open today or how much it costs.  <a
href="https://www.yomiuriland.co.jp/">Website</a> is all in, get this:
<em>Japanese</em>.</p>
