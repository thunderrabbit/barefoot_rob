                        <p class=date>8:41am JST Wednesday 23 April 2003</p>

<p>Today I saw a man systematically washing three traffic cones before
he put them on the sidewalk in front of his store.  It seems they are
washed with care each day.</p>

<p class=date>2:38pm</p>

<p>Also today:</p>

<p>I had walked to Tsunashima station to purchase flash cards, but the
store was closed.  That's when I saw the cat washing traffic cones.</p>

<p>I jumped on the express train toward Okurayama, but the express
doesn't stop there, so I had to take the local train back one
station.</p>

<p>While walking from Okurayama to the International Lounge, I found
another stationery store.  This seemed to be a sole proprietorship
since the guy behind the counter was older and a bit sneezy/sick.  I
figure an old cat wouldn't work at a cashier job unless he owned the
place, and a cashier wouldn't work somewhere while sick unless s/he
owned the place.</p>

<p>He had the exact cards I was looking for.  But he also had some
*better* cards than what I had been looking for!  These were cards
designed to be flashcards, all with a hole punched in one end and a
key ring holding them together.  I coulda gotten Hello Kitty cards,
but they cost more for fewer cards.  Sorry, cat; you're not that
cute.</p>

<p>I bought two sets of these.</p>

<p>Met with Koko and she spent 2 hours giving me a pile of Japanese
language and some kanji: push, pull, open, close, Sunday - Saturday,
month names, telling time, and some common greetings.</p>

<p>Funny was when she asked a question in Japanese and I was like, "je
ne sais pas" (sp!) and she recognized it as French.</p>

<p>My brain was quite full at the end of that.  Then we yammered in
mostly English for almost 2 hours.</p>

<p>At the end, she gave me a card that says in Japanese, "yo yo, cops,
chill; we loaned our bike to this cat." and gave me the key to her
mom's bicycle!  Wowwwzers!  And, gads, I don't have a gift for her in
return, but even worse, I didn't pay her 100 yen for the lesson!
Maybe the two hours of English yammering balances it all out.  But
I'll still get her (mom) a gift of some variety.</p>

<p>The tires were low on air so I walked the bike back home until I
passed a bike shop and paid 250 yen to have him replace the equivalent
of valve stems and air it up.</p>

<p>The locking mechanism was high on friction so I used a little
vegetable oil to fix it right up.</p>

<p>Now I've got a bike!</p>

<p class=date>3:19pm</p>

<p>Whoooooooo my bike is fast!!  So fast compared to walking.  Holy
shit!</p>

<p class=date>4:04pm</p>

<p>You know that rule "don't go shopping on an empty stomach?"</p>

<p>I broke that rule.  But (!!!!) my bike is so fast that I'm already
back from breaking the rule *and* have already eaten some of the
evidence.</p>

<p class=date>9:51pm</p>

<p>Fell asleep studying (that kinda thing happens when I study while
lying down in bed) and I've just worked on cleaning the kitchen for a
bit over an hour.  Add that to the list of things I've done today but
didn't actually plan to do.  The crusty layers of hardened grease on
the stove burner things is pretty disgusting.  I've gotten one of them
almost clean.  Haven't really touched the other, but it's been soaking
in hot soapy water for a while.</p>

<p>Frank is still at work and will be home probably in 20 minutes,
assuming he gets out right at 9.  Hey!  It's well past nine.   I'm
silly.  I dunno where Frank is.  Matty left about an hour ago to
return movies, but he's not back either.  [shrug]</p>

<p>I finished my cherry blossom mass email and I'll be sending that
out later tonight when I visit the internet cafe.  Gonna first write
one more letter to Gail from <a
href="https://www.geeky-boy.com/cgi-bin/bbs_thingie/showall">BBST</a>
as thanks for sending me red plaid flannel jammies ("jammy jams" as
Matty calls them).  I've worn them most nights since I got 'em.</p>

<p>Eeerg.</p>

<p>I have a sneaking suspicion that as soon as I get out of here
(internet cafe) I'm going to remember that which I feel like I'm
forgetting.  Oh I remember one thing.</p>

<p>Okay.  I hope that was it.</p>

<p>Good night, party people.</p>

<p>Class was good today.  I was less distracted by Karly cause she was
sitting out of my immediate view, but still she wore a low cut thing.</p>

<p>I crushed Karly and Olivia at reading hiragana; I'm sooo thankful
for Rie's help in learning them before I came to Japan.  Aright.</p>

<p>Yesterday:</p>

<p>Dru and I went to Ginza, where I don't remember what we saw.</p>

<p>Then to Akihabara, the electric/electronic megopolis of Tokyo!
Coolest thing there: refrigerators with hinges on both sides of the
door so they can be opened either way!</p>

<p>We looked for an electronic dictionary for me, a Canon Wordtank
IDF-3000.  I only mention the model because I've heard from two
separate people that they are flat the best.</p>

<p>All the different stores seemed to have the price pegged at 9980
yen, but then I found it for 9500 yen and bought it there.  9975
including tax, so I paid with a single 10,000 yen note.  Nice.</p>

<p>Dru helped me look for Genki I, a book suggested to me by Ayana.
The bookstore we visited didn't seem to have it.  On the way home I
looked at another bookstore and they didn't have it.</p>

<p>Also on the way home, I rode a crowded train.  It wasn't so bad
though; I could still breathe without effort. (*)</p>

<p>I chatted with Janette on the phone and we simultaneously
dropped/spilled something while 6000 miles apart.</p>

<p>(*) Back some years ago in like 1996 or so I went to a NIN concert
and was right up next to the stage.  The crowd behind me pushed so
hard that I found it difficult to take full breaths.  Nice.</p>

<p>Wow.  I'm surprised that I've not written in two days.  I worked at
Tsunashima on Sunday and Monday; it's like a vacation compared to
working at Kawasaki.  Plus Janis is tall and pretty and she's an easy
boss to work for 'far as I can tell.  She's practically married to
Corey though, who works at my school, which is good because it helped
me quickly get past all that wow you're hot stage.</p>

<p>I got two free lessons, one voice and one MtM (I really wish they
had called it One on One instead of propogating our patriarchal
society), and only 1 person in the voice room for my second voice (we
exchanged world travel stories; she's been to Giza and Thailand and
other fly places I didn't know existed) and a few man to mans and only
one lesson with 3 students.  That was a 7B but they were relatively
high 7Bs.  Compared to the other 7Bs I had yesterday.</p>

<p>Oh, and I had two level 3s!  Plus the woman in voice was level 3.
Easy shmeezy.</p>

<p>Nearly all of my lessons were just yammering in English, though I
did focus on drills for certain language structures.  Or tossed in
good vocab for the level 3s.</p>

<p>For my other level 3, against one of the main rules in the Nova
classroom, I wrote in hiragana when she told me a cool place to visit,
Hakkode (I think (good thing I wrote it down)) and she was like "wow
you're writing very well" or some shit and I showed her one of the
kanji I know (for tree, which looks kinda like a tree)</p>

<p>For the record, I know the kanji for river, mountain, tree, book,
wood,  and forest.  The last four are all simple variants of tree,
which is easy.  I only know how to pronounce river "kawa" (because
it's part of the name Kawasaki) and mountain "yama" (cause it's common
at the end of train station names) and tree "ki" cause it's part of my
friend Rie's last name.  (Aoki, "blue tree")</p>

<p>Showertime now, then studytime.  I've got a class at 10-noon then
Andrew and I are going to meet at Ginza at 1pm.</p>

<p class=dream>I looked out the window and saw how close I am to
Paris!  This seemed surprising that I hadn't realied it before, but
that I could just jum on a train and go to another part of the city
and visit the Eiffel Tower which was visibl in the distance.  Ryan had
told me how he had climbed the Eiffel Tower and I was like, "hey -
how'd he get to climb to the top of the ET, but I didn't and only got
to climb to the second level??" But if the Eiffel Tower is now
available for my climibng pleasure then so be it.</p>

<p class=dream>Our group went down the hall to Bryn's room and I was
hesitant to go at first since she hasn't written me back; I don't know
if she was mad at me or what, but I went anyway and she had a wall
hanging including different signatures from YRUU type people and I was
near the top of the list.  This made me feel loved and appreciated and
thankful I had come to visit.</p>

<p class=dream>Bryn's mom was there and I gave her a big hug and she
seemed happy with everything, but pointed out that the wallpaper
wasn't hung just perfefctly.  It was green and white vertical stripes
and matched the beautiful kelly green carpet.  I told her that this
place looked great for a dorm room and she outhgtn't worry about it.</p>

<p class=dream>On the train full of YRUUers as we all rode toward the
Eiffel Tower (?) this ex-youth from California whose last name is
White - he was on Youth Council..  anyway, he was driving the train
and we reached the end of the line and he was going a bit too quickly
so they train's emergency braking system had to be used, but no damage
occurred and the stop wasn't all that ahard and I wouldn't have even
noticed had I not seen us go past the end of the line.</p>

<p class=dream>Shira got a tad injured in the stop, like got a slight
puncture wound in her leg or something, but I couldn't really figure
out how that had happened and she wouldn't tell anyone.  But that's cool</p>

<p class=dream>Erin and Rosemary hooked up which was surprising to
most people but they were okay with it so everyone else was too.</p>

<p class=dream>My dad was at church leading the newcomers meeting,
describing what it would mean for them to commit to the church.  He
was winging his speech and I could tell he was nervous.  Afterward, he
was talking to people and I was nearby, but didn't turn around when he
exchanged nice-to-meet-yous with a couple of guys.  I didn't want to
meet them cause they were saying some bullshit about how great his
speech was and it really wasn't.  I was just going to say "man you
were really nervous and it showed" but I didn't want him to lose face
in front of his new friends or for them to lose face in front of
him.</p>

<p>am I turning Japanese?  (in Japan it's socially important to not
make anyone embarassed)</p>

<p>In seven minutes the time will be Roku ji han. "six o'clock half."
I remember this from when I fell asleep studying around jiu ni ji
"twelve o'clock."</p>
