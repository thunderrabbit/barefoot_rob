<p class=date>5:49AM Thursday, February 13, 1992</p>

<p><p>Yesterday I bought 3 stamps for a dollar from Lani, the beautiful
girl who was in my Calc II class.  Somehow I&rsquo;m going to go out with
her.</p>

<p><p>Danielle is not so mad at me anymore, so maybe I&rsquo;ll be able to go
out with her, too.</p>

<p><p>Laura and I went to the I-45 Drive-In to see FreeJack and Double
Impact.  FreeJack was cool, but not fantastic.  The theater is going
out of business, and will be shut down starting in March.  There were
only 1.5 other cars that watched our movie.  Laura and I kissed a lot
and didn&rsquo;t watch Double Impact.  I fingered her and she fondled me a
little bit.  Then we talked about it and she said that this was going
too far.  So I&rsquo;m not going to do it anymore.  I swear I won&rsquo;t.</p>

<p><p>On February 5, (Wednesday) Maggie and I had our pictures taken for
the yearbook.  Very cool.  The (female) photographer was quite smiley
and took care to make my &ldquo;THINK&rdquo; on my Thinkshirt legible.  I
appreciated that.</p>

<p><p>Last night, Forest and I talked for a while.  I told him what I
feel about breaking up with Tammy and why I&rsquo;m self centered lately.
He said &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at me.&rdquo; at one point because my gaze was
overpowering.  Cool.  I&rsquo;ve been working on being able to look into
people&rsquo;s eyes when I talk to them.  Now I can do it.</p>

<p class=date>Saturday, February 8, 1992</p>

<p><p>Today I worked at Kroger from 9 to 5 since then (It&rsquo; 10:25pm) I&rsquo;ve
been doing homework, dishes and catching up on the budget.  I&rsquo;ve got
my tuition for this current semester covered.  I got about 112 dollars
for 24 hours work at Kroger.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to contact someone from the dorms to go play
frisbee with them.  But no one has been there so I just keep on doing
homework.  In Calculus, we&rsquo;re doing vectors, which is incredibly easy
after Dr Bao&rsquo;s class.  Cool.  I got the first two homeworks on chapter
11 done on one sheet of paper each.</p>

<p><p>I recently recycled 610 pounds of newspaper and got $1.22 for it.  Cool.</p>

<p><p>This past Tuesday and Thursday, I&rsquo;ve been at the dorms while Laura
went to work in the evening.  So, she gave me her board card with
which to eat.  Thursday I got 2 entre&rsquo;s, a cheese burger, pudding,
corn, cake, 4 or 5 glases of milk, 2 bananas, aplle, 1 Cap&rsquo;n Crunch
cereal bowl. Dude.  I love the buffet style food there.</p>

<p><p>On Monday &amp; Wednesday, I confirmed a date with Danielle for
today. (Saturday) Then Thursday evening, Maggie said that Danielle was
mad at me for some reason.  Then on Friday morning, Danielle said she
could not got out with me.  I asked her why, and she said she&rsquo;d be too
embarassed??!!  Man&hellip; she didn&rsquo;t seem too incredibly interested in
discussing it, so I didn&rsquo;t pursue it.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m in the process of collecting cotton to send to Tara on the
Castle of Dreams BBS.  She makes stuffed animals, and I have access to
<em>lots</em> of cotton from work.  So I&rsquo;m sending her a big ass box
of it.</p>

<p><p>That&rsquo;s about it.  Later</p>

<p class=date>Wednesday, February 5, 1992</p>

<p><p>I screwed up getting Tammy after her trip.  I was at the airport at
9:13AM (The correct time) but when I looked in my planner, it said
11AM.  So I fucking waited for 2 hours until 11AM.  At that point, I
found out that 9:13 was correct and well&mdash;- Finally I was able to
contact Tammy at home.  She had gotten a ride with Lynn.</p>

<p><p>During Tammy&rsquo;s trip, I stayed with Laura all 3 nights.  I enjoyed
that bunches.  The first night, she wore a teddy.  Dude.  I had never
seen one before, much less slept with one.  So we made out a lot the
first 2 nights.  Not so much the 3rd night.</p>

<p><p>Tammy had fun on her trip.  She did it with Bonnie once, and the
next night she had sex with Bonnie and Rick at the same time.</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;ve been getting along realatively well lately.  I&rsquo;ve been
kissing Laura and Tammy doesn&rsquo;t care.  She&rsquo;s been out each night
messing around and I don&rsquo;t care.  In fact, lately I&rsquo;ve been pretty
self centered.  I have a pretty illogical and sometimes inconsistent
reasoning for what I do or who I kiss, etc.</p>

<p><p>Tammy is not mad anymore.  She&rsquo;s leaving for Colorado to see/fuck
Bonnie from the BBS.  I hope they do sex eachother.</p>

<p><p>Laura and I had planned to sleep in my bed while Tammy was gone,
but Tammy said no.  That kinda sucks, but I&rsquo;ll abide by it.  Later</p>

<p class=date>Wednesday, January 29, 1992 2:18AM.</p>

<p><p>Last night I spent the entire night at the dorms.  I slept beside
Laura.  We made out a lot.  This morning, she let me use her board
card to get breakfast.  That was cool.  I met 5 dudes in assembly.
Mike, Sam, Hassan, Sanjay &amp; Rick.  Cool.  Sam was in my assembly class
last semester, but he obviously dropped, too.  On the way to class
after breakfast, I threw a banana to Steve Avery, who was walking
toward us about 50 feet away.  He didn&rsquo;t catch it, ans Sam, who&rsquo;s name
I didn&rsquo;t know at the time, stepped on it unknowingly.  Funny.  After
school, I made out with Laura a bunch, and we also went to the
American Cafe to eat.  We got some cool UH napkins there.  When I got
home, Tammy was in a great mood until I told her I got a hickey from
Laura.  She was pissed for a long while, but got over it, and we
fucked.  I get to sleep in the big bed tonight.  Later</p>

<p class=date>Saturday, January 25, 1992 9:50PM.</p>

<p><p>Recently I came home and Tammy was horny.  I kissed her and she
said, &ldquo;you kiss differently.&rdquo; I told her I had kissed on Laura.  She
stopped for a full five minutes.  Nothing.  Then, &ldquo;You may sleep on
the couch tomorrow.&rdquo;  So that&rsquo;s it.  I slept in the big bed with her
that night.  Last night I got home late &amp; crawled onto the couch.
After work today, Tammy said, &ldquo;As far as I&rsquo;m concerned our
relationship ended when you kissed Laura.&rdquo;  So that&rsquo;s it. (again&hellip;) I
was sad &amp; mad at first, but now (2 hours later, I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;Oh well.&rdquo;
I&rsquo;m going out to the dorms now.  We&rsquo;re going to play frisbee.  I
finished my Discrete math homework. Later</p>

<p class=date>Wednesday morning</p>

<p><p>Yesterday was the First Day of school.  Maggie is in all 3 of my
classes!  Heather is in Physics III with us.  I talked to Laura.  It
turns out that she was crying because she just needed to talk instead
of make out.  She&rsquo;s upset about Kim since Laura spent all her time
with Kim one year ago.  Then Kim disappeared for a semester or 2, and
now he&rsquo;s back, and expects Laura to spend all her time with him
again. Laura reminded me that she is a person, which I had forgotten.
She said she wants a happy medium between kissing and talking.</p>

<p><p>After school, Laura and I saw Beauty and the Beast.  I was
dissappointed with the ending.  I liked the Beast better as a Beast.
Then we went to Transco Tower and to the Duck Pond, and to Bookstop
and to Randall&rsquo;s (to get Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s chocolate chip cookie dough ice
cream) and then to Herman Park, where we parked and ate ice cream and
made out.  I got a little too rough for her, but I was aware that I
might be, so I asked if she was comfortable.  She said no, so we
created the word pickles to indicate that we are not comfortable with
something.  Pickles is like me and Tammy&rsquo;s ear holding.  Later</p>

<p><h1>First Day Of School 1992</h1>

<p class=date>January 21st, Tuesday 12992 7:35AM.</p>

<p><p>Sunday after work at Kroger (which was easy.  I remembered most
stuff pretty handily.  Carol helped me learn a bit.  I met the
manager, Mr. Garvin, and he seemed impressed that I&rsquo;m a computer dude.
He asked if I could help put some (simple!) computations into his
Lotus 123 worksheet.  Heh Heh - &ldquo;this will be easy,&rdquo; I told him.  So
hopefully that will work out.  The 8 hours went by pretty quickly.
More on this later.)  I went out to the dorms.  We went to 2 Pesos,
and I had to mooch for money again.  Kim (the guy), Laura&rsquo;s friend
from 2 semesters ago is back.  I don&rsquo;t have detailed info on him, but
I will soon.  Anyway, at the end, Laura and I made out on her bed from
about 2:45 to 5:30AM.  At the end, though, as I was leaving, she was
crying.  Oh shit&hellip;. I had to go though, so we couldn&rsquo;t talk.  Man oh
man&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know if she&rsquo;s falling for me or what.  Today we&rsquo;re
going to talk during our lunch at 11:30.  Later.</p>

<p class=date>Saturday, Januray 18, 1992, 6:35pm</p>

<p><p>I called Greer, and he requested that I come in from 6AM to 2PM
tomorrow.  Holy Shit that&rsquo;s early.  I&rsquo;ll live, though.  Last night
after work, I went out to the dorms, and we all took Marcel&rsquo;s Legos to
John&rsquo;s house.  Actually, before we left, I met some other people in
the dorm.  I met Christa(?) (I think that was her name) and I re-met
Elizabeth.  (She was the Elizabeth that played football with us last
semester after ultimate frisbee) Elizabeth had received a bullwhip for
Christmas, so we were all cracking that.  It was cool.  I threw a
tennis ball and dotted a guy&rsquo;s eye with it.  I met him (Terry) that
way.  He looks just like Ted in Bill and Ted&rsquo;s Excellent Adventure.
cool.  At John&rsquo;s, we ordered 6 pizzas.  There were plenty of cokes,
and fun things.  Maggie &amp; Molly brought presents for everyone.  I got
a sweatshirt (wearing it) that has &ldquo;THINK&rdquo; embroidered on the top left
chest area.  I brought Maggie a thing of yogurt covered raisins from
Kroger.  They are super.  They also brought popping candy.</p>

<p><p>We all (All = Jodi, Greg, Laura, me, Maggie, John, Marcel, Cindy,
Danielle, Charlie, Molly, &amp; Steve.  These names are paired according
to who was hugging on who, except for the last two (Molly &amp; Steve) who
hugged on no one.) watched <em>Terminator 2</em> and <em>Joe versus
The Volcano</em>.  We never did get out Marcel&rsquo;s Lego&rsquo;s, though.  We
left there at about 2AM. Molly sat in my lap on the way home.  On our
way through OB hall, Dana, Stacia, and some security guy were in
there, so I gave them each a packet of popping candy.  Dana &amp; Stacia
exchanged flavors; Stacia likes orange, and Dana likes strawberry.  We
went to Larua &amp; Molly&rsquo;s room and I lay down for a bit on their bean
bag.  Laura walked me out, and we kissed for a few minutes at the exit
door.  Nice.  Oh- while we watched the movie, she rubbed my feet for a
few minutes.  I Loved it.  Tammy never does that.  Later</p>

<p class=date>Friday, January 17, 1992, 9AM</p>

<p><p>On Wednesday, John (Maggie&rsquo;s boyfriend) called me at about 11AM &amp;
invited me to go play racquetball at UH.  Cool! So we played 3 games.
he won the first two, &amp; I won the last one.  It was highly fun, and we
will do it again.  We&rsquo;ll aslo invite Maggie and Marcel.  John told me
that I was invited to a pizza party at his house on Friday (today) I
told him that I was invited to Lego night at Marcel&rsquo;s.  He was like,
&ldquo;Lego Night!!! Alright! Let&rsquo;s have it at <em>my</em> house!&rdquo;  So we&rsquo;re going to have a Lego, pizza night tonight at John&rsquo;s. Cool.</p>

<p><p>Wednsday late, Laura got home.  She called me, and I went out there &amp; helped her unload her car.  It was really great to see her and touch her and smell her again.  After unloading, we cuddled on her bed until about 5am.  I got home at exactly 5:30AM. (Tammy just left) Laura &amp; I made out like crazy.</p>

<p><p>Thursday, I layed on the modem and then went to Sear&rsquo;s to get some
black slacks.  Fuckin&rsquo; $43 dollars! (Don&rsquo;t be redundant.  Don&rsquo;t be
redundant.) After that, I went to the dorms at about 6PM.  As soon as
I got there, Jodi, Gred, John, Laura &amp; I left for Star Pizza.  Marcel
wanted to go, but they forgot to get him.  The pizza was great,
especially the crust.  It was whole wheat crust that would melt in
one&rsquo;s mouth like a biscuit.  cool.  While there, we watched the last
half of Bill &amp; Ted&rsquo;s Bogus Journey.  We got there just as they were in
Hell and the military dude said, &ldquo;drop &amp; give me <b>infinity!</b>&ldquo;
&ldquo;Ted, <gasp> there&rsquo;s no way I can do infinity pushups&hellip;&rdquo;  Very funny.
We got back and immediately found out Marcel wanted to go.  oops.
John &amp; I played againist Laura &amp; Marcel at Spades.  John and I beat
them handily.  The entire timie, John was staring at his watch,
waiting for Maggie &amp; Molly to get back.  Cool thing: They called his
mom from Little Rock, Arkansas.  Laura was trying to figure out how
far it was from there to here.  I pulled out my day planner, &ldquo;441
miles,&rdquo; I said.  Dude. what a handy dandy planner.  In order to make
the time go faster, we played Legos at Marcel&rsquo;s.  I made a car using
the design from my 8860 set.  (Big black auto chassis with big 4X4
wheels) Marcel had some cool-out pieces.  After I finished my car, I
went down to Laura&rsquo;s.  Molly was there! Alright!!!  I gave her a big
big hug.  It was wonderful to see her.  I deduced that Maggie must be
in her room, so I ran up there to see her.  She was like,
&ldquo;Hey. <recognized me> Oh, HI!!&rdquo;  Hug Hug I wanted to smooch her, but
as I did, she kinda moved &amp; made me miss her lips.  I will apologize
for it later.  Maggie is wonderful.  We unloaded their stuff and then
went to House of Pies.  (Oh - right after we returned from Star Pizza,
Jodi &amp; Greg retired to bed) (Oh 2 - Before I came out to go to pizza,
I called Laura, and she said they were leaving almost right away, and
that they were hungry.  So when I got there I said, &ldquo;Hey, dudes.&rdquo; &amp;
John instantly said, &ldquo;Ok let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; I really appreciated them waiting.
(That last sentence was the whole point of Oh 2.))</p>

<p><p>House of Pies was cool.  When we first got there, we saw a girl
with purple tightly braided hair, a nose ring and 3 lip rings.  They
were just big enough to fit over the roundness of her lips, so they
weren&rsquo;t likely to get caught on a fork or anything, but I had not seen
anything like it before.  Cool.</p>

<p><p>After house of Pies, we split up into our separate rooms.  Laura &amp;
I &amp; Molly went to their room.  I was darn tired &amp; lay on their bean
bag for a bit.  Laura invited me up to her bed, so I resed my head on
her bed.  We kissed a bit when Molly was in the bathroom brushing her
teeth &amp; stuff.  Then I cruised home.  On the way through OB, Dana and
some girl were at the OB desk.  (Dana is the girl who had me
introduced to her as Chuckie) The other girl was her roomate, Stacia.
I talked to them for a little while and then went home.</p>

<p><p>When I woke up this morning (Friday, still) Tammy was humping &amp;
grinding on me.  (There&rsquo;s no better way to be awakened) We had great
sex.  She told me about her night last night: 1) Hai asked her to
sleep with him. (She was flattered, but declined) 2) She had her
handwriting analyzed:</p>

<pre>
She will have twin sons.  The relationship she's in now (me) is not
good, and she needs to break it up, but she does not want to.  She's
self supporting, but doesn't believe it.  She'll go through 3 other
relationships before she finds the right one.  She'll have a major big
career change from what she is pursuing, and will be very rich & well
known in her new career.
</pre>

<p><p>Cool out.  I thought it was pretty neat the way he told her things
that were true without knowing her.  Dude&hellip; that&rsquo;s it.  Today I need
to call Christopher, Kroger guy, and set up my first work hours for
Sunday.  Then I&rsquo;m going to the dorms again and will go to Lego Pizza
night at John&rsquo;s with everyone.  Should be great.  I want to bring my
8860 set manual, and copy it, since Marcel lost his copy.  I also want
to bring some black string and rebuild his wenches.  (There were 3 of
them in a huge knot last night) So I&rsquo;ll check ya later.  Love Rob</p>
