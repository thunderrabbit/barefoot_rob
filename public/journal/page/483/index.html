<p>Chillin' with Fred and Karen now.  Not our dad's Karen, but our
friend from UU stuff.</p>

<p>Munchin' at Central Market.  I got avacado rolls for the wasabi-fun
I can have in a moment.  It's about to rain bigtime.  On one side it's
all sunny and on the other dark and menacing.</p>

<p class=date>6:23pm</p>

<p>Chillin' now at Karen and Robert's house with Julia speaking
baby-talk and Marna sniffing around.</p>

<p class=date>12:48am Friday 21 June 2002</p>

<p>Fred and I left as Karen, Robert, Julia left to visit their
neighbors.  Fred and I went to his school computer lab and hooked up
my laptop to their network.  Got ssh working: it was trivial; I had
been trying to set up my laptop as a server but I only needed to run
ssh from the command line.</p>

<p>Fred forgot to pick up his roommate Bill at 7:45, so we got to the
airport at 8:15, didn't find Bill so we left.  Turns out Bill's flight
was 30 minutes late, so we had just missed him.  A different friend of
Bill's picked Bill up.</p>

<p>Fred and i just got back from munching at Magnolia Cafe with Ma and
Jon for Ma's birthday.  Good stuff.  I'm pretty tired now; we're at
Fred's apartment about to sleeep.</p>

<p>Today is the day that Wende and I were going to be married.  How
amazingly different a life I have chosen since then.</p>

<p>This is my first official entry being written as a text file on my
powerbook. Since I don't have my .emacs file set up, I have to type
everything by hand, including the html markup tags.</p>

<p>Minh and Kevin helped me carry stuff out to the car.  I gave hugs
to Karla and Deborah, handshakes to Minh and Kevin; no one else was
there.  Minh walked me out with blessings of how fun it's been to work
together.</p>

<p>I layed out all <a href="/images/apt313/mess.jpg">my stuff</a> to get some
sense of organization.</p>

                        <p class=date>7:27 am Tuesday 18 June 2002</p>

<p>Woke up early and considered getting up to fold my laundry (rally shirts
on the bed), but rolled over onto them and fell back asleep.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>With YRUU peeps - Bryn, Mark V-S and others.  I had something
to give to Mark, but I couldn't remember where I had put it.  I looked in a
trash can next to where we were standing, but it had gross food wrappers in
it so I didn't look too deeply.</p>

<p class=dream>I was somehow skating with YRUU youth in my backpack like I
was piggy backing them.  I skated to some little shops selling various
random things.</p>

<p class=dream>Got a phone call from Ryan, who was looking for a ride to the
next rally.  I was all, "Ryan, you are 20 years old; you may not go."</p>

<p class=dream>He feigned surprise, "what?  What are you talking about?"
even though I know full well how old he is and that he knows the age limit
rule.</p>

<p class=dream>I became a bit angry with him, "Ryan!  You may not go, and
you know that."</p>

<p class=dream>Then we were in a room full of old junk and it was apparently
a shop, but the proprietor wasn't there.  We closed the door a bit, but left
the light on as we left.  I looked for my skates, but didn't find them at
first. </p>

<p class=dream>Found my skates, but considered just walking the remaining
black to go home.  I was sitting on the steps when three or four guys came
running up the steps from between the houses across the street.  They were
looking for someone who had stolen something.</p>

<p class=dream>At first I thought they were chasing each other, but then I
saw a guy climbing up a tree to hide.   They saw him too, and pulled his ass
out of the tree and had him on the ground and started to beat him up.</p>

<p class=dream>I was flat scared, but snuck my way back up the stairs as I
dialed 911.  The operator came on and she was all somewhat talkative and
thought I was kidding at first.  I told her I was afraid that would come
ofter me because they saw that I had a phone and was dialing.</p>

<p class=dream>The 911 operator was standing in the room with me as we hung
up, and she was still talkative and I was scared as pooh.  Then suddenly I
heard some <em>thump thump thump</em> up the stairs and I freaked a bit,
"seee?"</p>

<p class=dream>But it was the owner of the house, just walking up,
unaffected by what he had seen going on, dismissing it with, "they better ot
come up here." and then another guy came in and was completely thankful that
I had called 911; he gave me a big hug and I just started to cry on his
shoulder.</p>

<p class=dream>I could feel the texture of his shirt was a bit
strange.  I completely felt like my arms were hugging around him and I
realized I was dreaming.</p>

<p>I wondered if my arms were actually around something, but then realized
they really couldn't be given how I was laying. I slowly woke up to find
that my hands and forearms were right next to one another.  Cool how the
dream was so specific otherwise.</p>

<p>Wow.  Around 9:45am, Kevin called me into Kevin and Karla's
office.  As he closed the door behind us, I was all, <em>gulp,
did I do something wrong?</em>  I couldn't think of anything lately
that I'd screwed up, so I figured that wasn't it.</p>

<p>They were both all, "um, er," for about 4 seconds and then Karla
was all, "we just don't know how we can make it, even with people at
half time."</p>

<p>They were asking me to leave.</p>

<p>I'm actually quite thrilled and have no problem with this.  Just
gotta get my smiling face out and work odd jobs until I bust out of
the country.</p>

<p>They were more upset about the situation than me.  It's not like
they are losing a <em>ton</em> of information packed into my brain,
but some.  I told them my cellie is in my pocket if you have any
questions.</p>

<p>(That's me being unable to completely let go.)</p>

<p>I cleared out my electronic files, leaving all the work stuff
intact.  Moved them all to my powerbook.</p>

<p>Then Dude called me, "Two-punch Tuesdays!" At Mission Burrito, they
are giving two punches on their frequent eater cards.  I had already
told him the news of my freedom so I was all, "guess what?"  "what?"
"I can take lunch anytime I want!"  We both laughed.</p>

<p>After lunch I brought my car and two file boxes back to work to
clean out my physical desk and such.  At this point, everything is
cleared out except my linux computer, my bulletin board (not much on
there), and my scandia desktop shelf that Wende and I put together a
couple years ago.</p>

<p>The only thing I'm really going to miss is having the opportunity
to see Erika when she comes around (and Courtney).  That was becoming
less and less frequent, but I'll still miss it.</p>

<p>This is the <a href="/images/software/website/last_journal.jpg">last journal
entry</a> I'll send from my linux computer hooked up here at FSD.</p>

Cancri</a> is a star with a planet similar to Jupiter.  This star system is
41 light years away, and according to the article, would take 1 million
years for one of our spacecraft to get there (at current
technology/velocity).</p>

<p>I'm recording this to make note of the state of astronical technology (at
least as reported by US media).</p>

<p>I am at JASH (Japanese American Society of Houston) in the classroom
where there was scheduled to be a class starting at 6:30pm.  But so far no
other students have arrived.</p>

<p>I got to meet John Elsner, who I met over the phone via Larry, the owner
of 1/4 Price Books.  John is the Director of JASH.</p>

<p>The instructor just saw my keyboard and said <em>sugoi</em>,
fantastic.</p>

<p class=date>7:50 am Tuesday 18 June 2002</p>

<p>Two other students arrived last night.  Jessie and I forgot the other's
name.  They were in Level II japanese, but they were reading romanji instead
of hiragana.  Even so, I felt really slow and ill prepared to be in the
class.</p>

<p>I really am below that level of vocabulary they were reading.  Stuff
like, "Is there a post office nearby?"  "yes there is."  "where is it?"
"the post office is near the supermarket." but the instructor and students
were quite impressed that I knew hiragana.  I could basically pronounce all
of it aloud, but I had no idea what I was saying.</p>

<p>When they read it quickly, I could basically keep up with reading the
hiragana silently along with them.</p>

<p>The instructor will call me tonight (I've forgotten her name as well) to
let me know what first level class I can attend.</p>

<p>Oh my gosh I think I missed Laura's birthday!!  Is it today????  Why
isn't it in my calendar??</p>

<p>Yesterday morning I woke up and called Dude to check on his router.
Still broken.  I drove to my work to get the latest firmware and then to his
house to install it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I got the firmware for BEFW4S11 verion 2 instead of
BEFW4S11, so I drove back to work and got the right version.  </p>

<p>This time I called Linksys customer service (Oh, that reminds me that at
<a href="https://www.lynksis.com">lynksis.com</a>, there's a cat selling
Linksys routers via amazon.com.  I think that Linksys could quite
legitimately clain this would be confusing the consumers, the same argument
that Ford used on <a
href="https://www.fordreallysucks.com">fordreallysucks.com</a>, but Ford lost
that one (last I heard some months ago)</p>

<p>Anyway, I called CSR and found out what had happened.  They had the
<em>wrong</em> firmware on the FTP site.  The tech guy named Lane said he
had reported that to Linksys, and it wasn't fixed yet.  That is why the
router got hosed; I had downloaded what they said was the right firmware,
but it was for a different router!</p>

<p>So I had a guy email me the correct firmware, drove back to Dude's but it
was still broken.  That's when we called CSR again and got Lane, who
confirmed it was a new doorstop and would request an RMA to have Linksys
replace it, even though it's past warranty.</p>

<p>I'm like, durn tootin' you'll replace it (not, you, Lane, but Linksys)
because you guys screwed up and put the wrong firmware on the site.</p>

<p>Once it was determined we could do no more, I left and called Jason.</p>

<p>After Dude's, I went to Clear Lake to hang out with Jason and his family.
Got to munch boiled veggies and shrimp and cake and ice cream.</p>

<p>Between the meal and dessert, Jason and I went to his room and listened
to Eminem a bit, and I listened to some of Jason's original songs live.  It
was a Jason concert just for me.  Excellent.</p>

<p>Jason burned a copy of Eminem for me, my first illegally obtained music.
If I could send $2 to Mr Mathers and be assured he would get it, I'd do
that.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, our visit was cut short because I had a different
engagement at 6pm out in Katy.</p>

<p>After Jason't, drove back to my apartment, put on slacks and a shirt.
Good thing this was a dress up event, because I was flat out of clean
laundry.  I had been scraping by for a few days on recycled underwear.</p>

<p>Oh, so, yeah, I recycled underwear again for this event, but the rest of
my outfit was clean.</p>

<p>Drove out to Katy to attend the church service that included baby Luke's
baptism.  he's the youngest son of Robin, from my men's group. </p>

<p>The service was quite casual; some people wore shorts, and not everyone
carried bibles.  The preacher discussed Corinthians 11:17 - 24, talking
about how we should not argue about our differences and be mindful  when
taking communion.</p>

<p>He invited us to ask four questions of ourselves, and if we answered
truthfully yes to all of them, to come take communion, otherwise to remain
seated and know that no one there would, "look down on you or say
anything."</p>

<p><em>Fair enough</em>, I thought, and prepared to answer the questions in
my mind:</p>

<p><ol><li>Do you believe you are a sinner?  (no)</li>
<li>Do you believe Christ has forgiven you for your sins?  (well, no; I
believe there is no sin.)</li>
<li>Do you believe blah blah blah? (I think I answered yes to this one; I
can't remember the question)</li>
<li>Do you believe that this is the body and blood of Christ? (no. Well, no.
I believe that God is everywhere, so that God is the wine and God is the
bread, and God is the chair, and everything around us, if that counts for
you.)</li>
</ol>

<p>I respectfully declined to take communion.</p>

<p>But I did record Luke's baptism on video.</p>

<p>- - -</p>

<p>Afterwards, the friends and family of Robin and Louisa all attended a
lovely Italian restaurant to munch.  My food came last because I ordered
something not on the menu: cheese ravioli with alfredo sauce and mushrooms.
I didn't think it would be that confusing in such a nice restaurant, but
whatever.  I enjoyed my meal.  I thought about blessing it in Japanese, but
I can't remember the phrase.</p>

<p>Great to see Tom & Dierdre and Glenn and buds from my I-group.</p>

<p>Talked to Sally while waiting for my laundry to wash.  She told me
stories of her night sailing adventure and a different adventure where they
had to be towed back because the wind stopped.</p>

<p>She'll be working bigtime on her thesis that is due in 6 weeks.  She says
it's the size project that she thinks would take 6 months.  She's in the
stage now of, "where oh where do I begin???"</p>
