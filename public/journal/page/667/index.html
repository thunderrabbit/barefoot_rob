<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<p><ul>
<p><li>I am for sure going to quit work at my JOB on 19 June.</li></p>

<p><li>I'm super excited about activities planned for the youth group this summer and beyond!
<ul>
<li>First Sunday youth worship</li>
<li>Third Wednesday youth dinner</li>
<li>Last Sunday youth planning meeting</li>
</ul>
and we have scheduled a Social Action Lock-in for 13 June!
</li>

<p><li>I have completed "weaning" myself from my JOB computer. I have my own ISP (FlashNet) and my own modem, zip drive, etc etc. Oh and computer still.</li>

<p><li>Cool thing is that now with my ISP I can have AOL IM chat thing up and ICQ chat thing. Email me if you want my numbers and stuff.</li>

<p><li>I'm a bit behind in journal entries; there are 2 I for sure wanted to get in here, but I don't know if I will. One was that I woke up at 3am to crazy rustling and whining in the tree by my window, and I had no idea what it was and feared the worst: my cat was killing a small whining animal and was about to jump to the window to bring it inside.

<p>Turns out it was just raccoons eating the fruit on the tree! It's a loquat tree and they taste pretty good and are just past ripe (by my judgement) now.

<p>I forgot what the other thing was.</li>

<p><li>I'm excited about GA coming soon to a city near me! (Rochester, New York (okay, not so near, but I'm going!))</li>

<p><li>Today at church only kT, Jon, and Nicole were there.  kT and Nicole babysat; Jon and I chilled and helped them a bit.</li>

<p><li>Today I'm going with my mom to Slidell to see her sister who has cancer. It's an icky all-over-body cancer and I'm sad to see her all messed up.</li>

<p><li>I have an Astroworld Season Pass but I have only gone twice this summer so far!  Auugh!!  I expect I'll go many more times once I quit my job.</li>

<p><li>I am reading <em>Your Money or Your Life</em> by Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin. Somewhere in the book it describes that before the industrial revolution, people worked about 3 hours per day. Three.

<p>I think I'll make that my goal.</li>

<p><li>My skating abrasions are healing nicely.</li>

</ul>

                        <p><title>Wild Skating Adventure</title></p>

<p class=date>22 May 1998</p>

<p>Move the fan so you can chill in it when you get back. 'kay.

<p>Sit. Right sock. Nice and tight almost up to my knee. Left sock. yes. Right sock stretches over the other. Left sock stretches. Perfect.  Right knee pad. The one with the crack. velcro on. Left knee pad. the other. velcro on. feels good.

<p>Stand. Analysis: good.  need keys. let's go.

<p>CD player: click. Sir Mix-A-Lot "Posse On Broadway" off.

<p>Out the door. lock the door. There's Spot! He's so fuckin brazen that he won't even move out of my way. Spotty I have skates on that are each bigger than you. I could crush you

<p>Step carefully down the steps over Spot. Yes. Now he is at eye level.

<p>"Hi Spot"  He loves to be scritched. I love my Spotty. "hey spot" scritchy scritchy "I'll be back."

<p>clunk clunk clunk clunk down the steps. Down. Let's go!

<p>Smooth sailing out of the parking lot. down the drive to the street. cars coming I turn sharp onto the sidewalk.

<p>Over cracks, sticks, little seed pod things. Why do people have trouble with these? I just skate over them.

<p>Woman at the bus stop. "HI"

<p>She smiles.  Probably doesn't speak English. Probably is jealous I'm on skates.

<p>Cross the street. cars? behind me is clear. Slide across to the other sidewalk cause there is a car coming from ahead.

<p>Intersection I just sail around the corner of the boat shop. No one on the sidewalk. good.

<p>HI person in car in traffic wearing shirt and tie! I'm on skates, fucker! hahahaha!  That would be rude. He's probably jealous too.

<p>Rocks on sidewalk. why are they always right here? sail right over them.

<p>need to cross Montrose. No cars coming at me step off curb slide across the street uh oh cars leaving the intersection like greyhounds. Slide across to the next sidewalk. 

<p>oh man what a crappy-ass sidewalk. Bushes hanging in my way. stand up and slide past and the leaves scutter across my NO Fear shirt. grass growing into the sidewalk all broken up. step from piece to piece no problem. 

<p>Greyhounds that passed are now stuck at this light. I turn right onto Dallas. Cars behind? No. Hop off curb into street.
Get longer strides. 

<p>Ahhh. <pre>push push push.</pre> Yes. No cars. I slide across to other side of street, along construction fence, keeping me from the sidewalk. Oncoming traffic. Face them down. Get out of my way fucker. They change lanes. They all change lanes this time.

<p>Past the fence I hop back onto the sidewalk for a car to go by. See I can be nice too. 

<p>No cars. back onto street. <pre>push push push</pre> Nice. Intersection ahead. Taft. Almost there. I have a red light. Anything coming? no. well yeah. stop.

<p>Okay clear. wait for greyhounds to go by.  Across Taft to my ramp. My precisely timed acceleration runway.

<p>What was that time again? I think 20 seconds. Yeah 20. stop and wait for the count.

<p>Okay. cars on left are stopped at the light. Once they take off, count 20. Is that it? I think so. Feels right.

<p>There they go. one. Go cars. two. go go go. three. four. five.
cars coming (six) down my ramp. seven. eight. nine. calibrate counter. ten. am I right? eleven. yes. it's all good. twelve. thirteen. fourteen. fifteen. More cars (sixteen) coming down (seventeen) my ramp. right after (eighteen) them I'll go. nineteen. twenty. perfect.

<p>Go go go go go go <pre>push push push push push push push push</pre> haul ass baby yes it will change green trust me go go hmmm slow down a tiny bit. Green! <pre>push push push push</pre> go go go go no one is turning right good fly into intersection arcing big wide right turn across all those lanes go go go go no one is coming from behind but oh shit they are coming from ahead but I can make it <pre>up onto curb</pre> I can make it <pre>push push push push</pre> fucking shit lamp post right where I..fine cut to the left there's a fucking minivan hauling ass at you. <pre>cut</pre> this is going to be a miracle <pre>jump-onto-curb-feet-planted-to-stop</pre> shit <pre>slide crunch into wall</pre>

<p>Ow fuck. Van just went by. Jump up you are okay. I'm okay everyone! see look at me fuckin bad ass skater jump up and skate.  fuck that hurt!

<p>shake it off. analysis: everything moves okay. Skinned my right forearm. skinned my left forearm and upper arm. bruised my right hip. base of my right pinky hurts. Bones okay? I do a gentle all over body wiggle-dance. All bones are okay. Any deep bruised muscles? All muscles okay. I'm still skating. clothing? NO Fear shirt is fine. I look down and my shorts have three shredded holes on the right leg. fuckit. let's go.

<p>panting. skating. adrenaline electrifies. I can barely feel any pain. Hi jogger. yes, I'm quite fine. these? oh - nothing at all. mere scratches.

<p>rolling slow around the bend and up the hill. gentle pushes on this small asphalt sidewalk.

<p>Along Allen Parkway. Look it coulda been her in that little red car instead of the minivan. coulda been anyone.

<p>two teen age bicyclist chillin' watching me approach. do they see? did they whisper a comment? Probably. they're impressed that I'm still going.

<p>Across the small entrance to Allen Parkway. No cars. no problem.  down the slight hill.

<p>Car coming toward the next entrance.  too far away to matter. I cross no problem.

<p>Up around Sam Houston Park real slow just sliding through.

<p>Not at the intersection but no cars so I cross the street to the library in view of a bus pulling away from the stop.

<p>hey Mr Bus Driver look at my scrapes. He's probably busy.

<p>Down McKinney all the way to Louisiana Street. Lights are still timed for rush hour traffic. Cool. I don't get to skate that very often.

<p>Skate gently on the sacred white marble. Will they shoo me off this time?  apparently not. I'm just skatin casual. 

<p>Curb. Street. traffic trying to go home across my path. Last car goes by and I push across the intersection before the greyhounds get a chance to invade my space.

<p>Along another construction fence. man this one's been here forever. Here comes my next hill, down to Jones Plaza.

<p>In the lee of the fence I wait at the next intersection for my green light. Their light turns yellow and I go! Greyhounds will be attacking from behind. go go go go <pre>push push push push push</pre> go go go down the hill to the intersection green light. I'm in front of all the cars. <pre>push push push push</pre> across the intersection watch that lumpy manhole cover
down the hill past Jones Plaza tuck like a downhill skiier. no one is there at the Plaza to watch. Oh well.

<p>cop car is parked ahead does he care? Sail across next intersection cars are overtaking me but I'm sliding along the left hand side parked cars I am safe.  <pre>Sideways jump</pre> onto curb slow down on sidewalk.  Slow down .. slow .. gentle calm slow skating past the two cops talking. I'm just skating, sir. They don't say anything.

<p>Across the red carpet of Birraporetti's, turn left around the corner, where they can all see me while they're eating. Look at my blood, pasta eating nicely dressed folks. I'm skating and you're not.

<p>Sneak around the blind corner up the Alley Theater driveway thing. The building on the right is gutted.  but two nicely dressed folks are walking out the door.  hmmm.

<p>back around onto Jones Plaza I go in search of water. Gotta wash this shit off. oh it's going to sting. I can tell.

<p>up the steps <pre>clunk clunk clunk</pre> to the faucet. Turned the handle. nothing. fuck! why they gotta turn the water off?

<p>There's a guy chillin against the wall. Probably homeless. I ask him if he knows where I can get some water. He points out there are more faucets to try in each corner of the Plaza. cool.

<p>I check and the first two have no handles. Third one does. Turn it and it works. relief.

<p>rip the three velcro strips to get my right wrist pad off. <pre>rip rip riiip</pre> Three more for the left. keep the water running to clear out the pipe. Need sanitary water for this.

<p>look at pinky. holy shit! I have a hole scraped the size of a nickel under my right pinky. That's why it hurt so much! I let the water flow over it and relax into the pain, no it's not pain, just sensations coming from my hand. rinse rinse rinse it out.

<p>Okay, left elbow forearm scrapes. splash water up to rinse them off. I stick my elbow in the water flow for a second and relish the coolness of the water. Back out and feel the sting sensation. Relax into it. no pain.

<p>Right forearm scrapes. This one's not as bad. I splash water and gently wipe my watery hand over it. Not too bad at all.

<p>I turn the water off and go sit on the wall by a sign that begins "NO SKATES OR SKATEBOARDS ON PLAZA"

<p>I'm not skating I'm rinsing my arms. Oh Mr Politician would you rather I go to the hospital and cost the city five hundred dollars to get all bandaged up instead of a few pennies of water? I'm not hurting anything.

<p>Dude, chill. There is no one here. It's just a sign.

<p>My brain quiets as I watch a man painting a concrete wall.

<p>Across the street is Bayou Place, Houston's latest loveliest entertainment complex in downtown. Houston's going to be like San Antonio someday. Someday.  I love the city when it's alive.

<p>My scrapes are pretty much dry and I put my wrist pads back on. Now down the steps I gently step. Don't want to fall right now. Hey you won't fall unless you're nervous about falling. Okay. I'm not nervous all the way safely to the sidewalk.

<p>Across the street now on the back side of Alley Theater. Still rush hour traffic. 

<p>What do I want to do?  Go home?  No way. not yet.

<p>University of Houston is only several blocks away. Yeah. I love the hill. Across another street I cross while traffic is fully two blocks away.

<p>Up a hill I slowly push. Wow I am pretty trudgefully tired.

<p>I step up onto the sidewalk. It's a crappy one but I don't want to mess with traffic right now.

<p>I pass some people chilling by La Caraf. See my scrapes? Look, and I'm still skating. See? They don't comment.

<p>I reach Travis Street and stop for traffic. They are sailing down the hill to Interstate 45 to take them home. Their light turns red, so I hop out onto the street around another construction fenced off sidewalk and wait at the light with the cars.

<p>Other traffic light turns yellow as a van sneaks through at the last minute. I go. <pre>push push push push push</pre> go go go go down the hill in the unused parking lane while the traffic roars by. 

<p>Is that it? I look and that's it. I slide across to the right hand side of the street to the sidewalk and down the hill under the railroad tracks faster faster faster and I pull out my cell phone to call Wende.

<p>I push the buttons and listen as I sail to the bottom and back up the hill. <pre>push push</pre> gently up the newly paved asphalt driveway toward the ground level Police Station underneath University of Houston Downtown.

<p>phone is still ringing. She must not be there. Oh well. back into my pocket it goes.

<p>I cross the railroad tracks that are there and holy cow they've been ripped up! I look down the path where the tracks used to be and they are totally ripped up. All the ties are gone and the rails lay on the side like shoestrings. Extremely heavy shoestrings.

<p>I trudge up the driveway to street level, past two guys walking down wearing military looking uniforms. "HI" I say to each. See my arms? Look. see??  They don't comment.

<p>I arrive up at Main Street. I still have to trudge up the Main Street hill. A bus rumbles by. Another. I still press up toward the top, where people are waiting for even another bus.

<p>At the top. I chill and look out over where the railway used to be. The main line is still there. I wonder where the ripped up one goes. Or where it doesn't go anymore.

<p>I'm rested and ready to go down the hill. Not just go down. To fly down the hill at breakneck speeds, except I will not wreck. That was years ago that I wrecked on this hill. No worries. I've done it twenty times since then and never had a problem.

<p>But it is rush hour and the light is timed differently. I sit on the wall beside a sign that says "FORTY FOOT DROP DO NOT SIT ON WALL" or something like that. I didn't pay attention to it.

<p>Light turns red. I count. I get to 30 and it turns green. Perfect. I chill while it's green and wait for it to turn red again. I count. Fifteen seconds and 4 cars and a bus go by. 

<p>No traffic is headed down the hill so I jump off the wall.
Sixteen. Seventeen. Eighteen. Nineteen. I go. Twenty.

<p><pre>push push push push</pre> I pick up speed down the hill in the right hand lane. No traffic is behind me. I pause my pushing to <pre>jump</pre> over the evil groove of death that thwarted me so many years ago. <pre>push push push push</pre> again now tuck like a downhill skiier and I fly across the intersection.

<p>Crap. There were no cars to watch me go by.

<p>Oh well. I coast most of the way up the hill and then turn right on Franklin.

<p>I slide up to red light and it turns green as I approach. Perfect. Again <pre>push push push push push</pre> go go go go go over the insanely bumpy Travis and down the hill toward Brewery Tap, but all traffic must turn left as the bridge is out ahead. Look behind no traffic coming. the street is mine as I make a big sweeping left hand turn stepping skate over skate over skate over skate to turn. Traffic is watching.  I love that.

<p>Up the hill into cars stuck at the red light. I manuever in between them and over to the sidewalk. Traffic is done crossing in front of us so I go while we still have a red light.

<p>It's not red for long and the greyhounds race to pass me. Fine. I'm not racing uphill. You win.

<p>Up beside Kim Son I skate, past The Chronicle building on the other side of the street.

<p>Traffic is less crazy now as I get back to Jones Hall and Jones Plaza.  One more time down the hill. Okay.

<p>Back up to the lee of the construction fence I go and wait. Light turns green and I go go go go god i'm tired go go go down the hill watch the lumpy manhole cover tuck like a skiier down the hill I barely have any speed and don't even make it to the red carpet. That sucked. Time to go home.

<p>Back up Louisiana street I push past people and cars. I had a great time and I'm going home people. Thank you. Yes, I'm going home.

<p>But one more hill will be mine first. to Lamar Street which will scoop down and dump out onto Allen Parkway. I ride slowly along the sidewalks to get to the starting place.

<p>Two cars are at the intersection. Maybe three; I only care about the white car on the right, not the others. Light turns green and I take off and she tries to turn right in front of me.

<p>Hey! Where's your blinker?? I cut my acceleration and she stops and I take off again in a wide birth around her. <pre>push push push</pre> across the intersection and begin to zingg down the hill.

<p>hey weird, they are tearing down the building there. Another construction fence blocks the sidewalk. That's okay, I'm going to use the street anyway, thank you.

<p>Eyes back on street as I crouch down like a skiier and whizz past the fence and down the hill. Yes I am tired and stop to look out over Sam Houston Park for a second.

<p>Hey cool. they built a small wooden bridge over part of the water.  Good deal. I like all this construction going on.

<p>I visualize myself skating over the wooden bridge before I begin again to trudge up the hill to Allen Parkway.

<p>No cars are coming and I'm safely across to the sidewalk.

<p>Now it's just the long trek back toward where I had my accident. Will there be blood?  will I be able to see it at all? I assume so, since the lamp post is my marker.

<p>I see a bicyclist again in the parking area. Is he one of the same ones I saw earlier? I'm not sure.

<p>Along the path I cruise, not slow, not fast. No worries and I'm just skating.

<p>Down around the big field and up by some azaleas and back toward the straight bridge sidewalk again and there's my lamp post.

<p>I roll up to it and clearly see two black streaks of plastic shreds on the concrete.

<p>Ah. there. I see a smoother streak. I get down on my hands and kneepads. yes. hair. Little arm hairs shaved right off my arm. I smile. Wow.

<p>I don't see any others. I get up. Wow.

<p>One last big traffic crossing to get to Taft. Allen Parkway traffic does not have to stop, and they fly like fifty miles per hour down the hill.

<p>I see a break in traffic and go for it, just as this traffic's left hand turn lane light turns green. Nice.  I scoot across Allen Parkway and into then across the line of cars turning left. Up the curb then down the curb and I scoot across the other half of Allen Parkway and up the curb and down the curb and across the feeder road and up the curb to the sidewalk.

<p>Practically home free. But still gotta trudge up this hill. I press my way up, past a woman carrying what looks like a cheesecake out of Antone's. Cool. Cheesecake.

<p>Up to Dallas Street, the light is red for Taft so I cross over to the other side and along the Dallas Street sidewalk. No traffic so I cross Dallas Street to the other side. I like to face traffic when I skate so they can't sneak up on me.

<p>All the way up Dallas I go to Montrose. I would just bust across but there's a cop car on the other side. No reason to get in trouble now after all this.

<p>I pant and sweat and wait for the light to turn green.

<p>Damn it's taking forever and I coulda crossed twenty times by now. It turns green and I cross once.

<p>Along Montrose almost to West Gray, and finally someone who understands. A guy carrying skates is walking toward me. I bend my elbows to show my trophies. I smile, "How's it going?!"

<p>"Damn" he says.

<p>fwew. West Gray. Only one point five more blocks to go. No traffic so I slide across the street to my side. Up the driveway and around the back.

<p>Do I take my skates off now or wait until I get upstairs? Wait. You don't want to carry them up. Good point.

<p>Clunk clunk damn there's Spot again. At least he's on a different step this time. Sorry Spot I can't pet you right now. Gotta clean up.

<p>Keys in my pocket? Yes. Chain wallet is in the way. I pull the chain and out it comes. The chain. No wallet??! What the hell, the wallet was ripped off my chain when I wrecked.

<p>The wallet is still chillin' in my pocket, but wow. it got ripped off the chain!

<p>keys. door. unlock. inside. turn on fan. sit.

<p>Wow. Wrist guards off. One stinky skate off.  Another stinky skate off. One, one, two, two stinky socks off. Helmet off. Sweat pours in a small stream onto my shorts and shirt.

<p>Stinky shredded shorts off. Shirt off. Underwear off. Shower on. Oh this is going to sting.

<p>No it's not. Chill. Relax into it.

<p>Water feels cool on my feet and hands. Pinky doesn't hurt.

<p>Right elbow in. Right elbow out. It doesn't hurt so I rinse it all out. I get the soapy soap and soap it all up. I just relax and feel no pain.

<p>Left elbow same thing. Wow. just feel the sensation. Not pain. Just wash as if everything were normal. No pain. Amazing.

<p>I get out and dry off with a clean towel. Neosporin and bandages all right where Wende put them in a medical kit for me months ago. Nice.

<p>Right elbow first cause it's the smaller one. gauze, tape, forgot the neosporin. untape. neosporin. tape. done.

<p>Left elbow. gauze tape forgot the neosporin. untape. neosporin. tape. done.

<p>Pinky. neosporin. gauze. tape.

<p>I'm too tired to clean up anything. 

<p>Phone off.

<p>Lie gently in bed.

<p>Relax.

<p>Sleep.</p>

<p>I just now got myself signed up on Flashnet, an ISP to replace the access I get from work.  Since I'm quittin' soon, I'm weaning myself away from work.

<p>I have my new computer, and I just ordered a new 56k modem online today.

<p>At most 23 more days of work here after today.</p>

<p class=date>14 May 1998</p>

<p>The feeling I have now while at work is the same as I had when the semester would come toward the end at school. Longing desire to be <b>finished</b> but I can't slack off yet.

<p>And then part of me goes, well, actually you <b>can</b> slack off now and it really wouldn't matter all that much. It's just 2 pay periods you would miss.  

<p>Two pay periods? 1 month? Hmmm. Actually 2.5 pay periods. Do I need the dollars? I don't know.

<p>I am considering having laser surgery done on my eyes. 2.5 pay periods would pay for most of that. Hmm. For my eyes I can do it.

<p>But arggghh!!!!</p>

                        <p><title>Skating</title></p>

<p class=date>14 May 1998</p>

<p>I just got back from skating downtown with Diane. It was the first time we've skated in months! And before that it was like half a year before we had skated!

<p>I excitedly described the hopes and visions I have for the cluster, and that I'd like to create a position where I can actually make some dollars doing that which I love.

<p>Diane asked about the new phone number for Wende that's indicated on my answering machine. I explained that she moved out and the conversation turned to how Wende feels about me making dollars as a youth advisor. After hearing the situation, Diane quickly articulated how I could sell the idea of creating a paid position for Wende as well!

<p>I had never thought of such a possibility of having <b>two</b> paid positions because I can hardly fathom <b>me</b> getting paid for it.  Wow.

<p>We first skated to Jones Plaza where I noticed there were surprisingly few skaters! When we got up there, we were asked to sign an IpromisenottosueifIbustmyass waiver before we go in.

<p>Diane was pretty entertained reading the legal jargon. However, we were not sufficiently entertained to sign it.

<p>Down the street to a parking lot we went where I got a call from Ms Wende on my cell phone. I described to her the idea and I think she liked it. We'll have to talk about it later.

<p>Wende was entirely pissed and sad that I was out skating with Diane. We spent nearly 10 minutes on the phone while Diane skated in big circles around the parking lot.

<p>Once I got off the phone, Diane was all, "well, did you tell her that we are just friends and not interested in a sexual relationship?" No I hadn't.

<p>Diane encouraged me to call her back, so I did and that helped a lot.  Thank you, Diane.

<p>Then we cruised out to our parking lot at the base of the Main Street hill.  (That's the hill by University of Houston Downtown campus, quickly down which I love to skate.)

<p>We spent probably 30 minutes there, skating in large circles around the parking lot, with me jumping up and down a pair of sequential curb things. (Yeah that makes sense)  Anyway, it was like two curbs right in a row, so I jumped up then down then back up in a tiny little space. Pretty fun stuff.

<p>After a while, we headed back, but stopped by Jones Plaza for me to go car surfing. Well, Diane stopped and I went up the street to catch the next green light pod of traffic. Just as I arrived, the light was fully green and the cars were zipping through so I made a tight turn and joined their ranks.

<p>push push push push until I was up to speed and just behind a long Oldsmobile looking car. I was slightly to his right so he could turn left in front of me with no problem.

<p>Zing through the light and he didn't turn left but he's slowing down.... So I look to the right (it's clear) and slide right into the next lane of traffic and pass the Olds. whhiishh!

<p>There's a car fully slowed in front of me so I slide back left in front of the Olds and zip through the light. Perfect! Push push push push through and keep angling left toward the curb and hop onto the sidewalk to stop.

<p>I love doing that!

<p>Diane clapped for me as I skated back up the hill to her.

<p>"Did you see me pass that car???" I was out of breath.

<p>"I <b>did</b> see it. Wow!"

<p>Yay! That was super super fun.

<p>We skated slowly back up Louisiana and stopped by for cold water at the YMCA before getting back to her truck. We took our skates off and stretched and she brought me home and here I am.</p>

                        <p><title>Moving my homestead??</title></p>

<p class=date>13 May 1998</p>

<p>Today I added the GeoGuide to the YRUU site. I was impressed with the ease of putting it on the site and that it keeps the annoying pop-up windows from popping up.

<p>The GeoGuide includes a banner, which may be someone's personal webpage on Geocities.... Like maybe <b>my</b> webpage on Geocities..  Hmmm.

<p>So I looked at what it would take to get my banner on there and it's not too hard except they want the website being advertised to match its homestead and address.  Hmmm.  Mine does not.

<p>Therefore, I am actually considering moving my site to SoHo instead of Baja. However, there are many links that have baja/2175 hardcoded in them..  Hmmm.

<p>So then I thought, ahhh.. too much trouble; I won't do it.

<p>Then I thought from a bigger scale... wait-a-minute.  What is my goal? More hits on my page. What else?  Um, I don't know.
<br>Fine, so in one year do you want to have even <b>more</b> hardcoded links out in the world to have to change or what?  Cause the you then will be all mad at the you now for being a wuss for not just doing the work and getting it finished!

<p>Good point.

<p>Then(!!!) I realized something else.  Wait-a-minute!  I can use www.geocities.com/~thunderrabbit to get to my site! So I can just tell everyone to use that URL and then when I move to a new address, no problem. Everything will work beautifully smoothly and it'll be all good.

<p>The biggest obstacle I have overcome so far is emailing the seven Robs who are part of the <b>Webring for people named Rob</b> and asking them to change their references to my page.

<p>Once those pages all get fixed, the rest is smooth sailin'.

<p>So, if you have a link to my page, please make it https://www.geocities.com/~thunderrabbit/</p>

<p class=date>11 May 1998</p>

<p>Today my boss was all pissy when he came in to work and it rubbed off on me. While we were in our weekly meeting, I had to close my eyes in meditation so I wouldn't suddenly announce,<br>
"I quit."

<p>After the meeting, I talked with Dave and we hashed out our differences and stuff. We were all cool and I talked to him about wanting a leave of absence starting in June. We had discussed it before so he wasn't caught entirely off guard.

<p>We talked about 30 minutes, including the possibility of me not coming back. He said that if I did I would have to be ready to work. By the end I was all, "I'm not coming back."

<p>So I gave my notice as my last day being 18 June 1998.

<p>With a newfound joy, I jumped on my current project and got more work done on it than I would have.

<p>Weird.</p>

<p class=date>Monday 11 May 1998</p>

<p>Today Wende moved most of the rest of her stuff out, including her cats. She did a super fantastic job sweeping up the 20 or 30 pounds of cat hair from the living room and dining room.

<p>It was unreal to me..  Seeing the hardwood floor again, without the rug... I have my space back!  I am excited about that. I really appreciate Wende's hard work to clean up.

<p>Spot, my cat, is still in a state of disbelief.  For 1.5 years he has not been able to safely venture past the bedroom to where Wende's cats were. I didn't see him all night; I wonder if he was scared to come in the window because the bedroom door is open?</p>

<p><p>This Sunday at church was the 8th graders&rsquo; Affirmation Sunday, honoring their place in the church and welcoming them into the high school program.</p>

<p><p>We had a slightly different preparation process this year; the youth paired up with adult mentors who worked with them in various fields of growth, from creating a personal view of God and religion, to doing some service work for the community.</p>

<p><p>The youths&rsquo; speeches were beautiful; I could hear sniffling noses in the audience behind me and my sniffling nose.</p>

<p><p>After the sniffling, we had pizza!  Yay!  Pizza for all and then even better, a trip to the Woods&rsquo; beach house down on the beach.</p>

<p><p>We piled into 3 vehicles and cruised down there, talking, laughing and playing silly mind games with one another.  (&ldquo;Ceiling Wall Floor&rdquo; and &ldquo;Name That Famous Person&rdquo; were the most played)  Oh, we also sang, &ldquo;I know a song that gets on everybody&rsquo;s nerves&rdquo; and &ldquo;This is the song that never ends&rdquo; to pass several minutes..</p>

<p><p>Dang. Now the song is cycling through my brain.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ll be right back.</p>

<p><p><hr></p>

<p><p>19 May 1998</p>

<p><p>Their beach house is pretty cool.  It&rsquo;s dome shaped, and is made up of like 50-some-odd wooden triangles.  There is an upstairs and downstairs and living room and kitchen and 2 bedrooms.</p>

<p><p>We chilled for a bit and after all the youth ran out to go swimming, a wandered out there and began to bury my feet in the sand.</p>

<p><p>Each time I go to the beach, I dig some kind of hole, usually until the water come sloshing over it from the surf, or bubbling up from the bottom.. in either case, flattening the hole into a gentle puddle on the beach.</p>

<p><p>This day I simply stood and dug a hole with each foot, burrowing slowly down into the sand.  After not too long, I had them buried up to my ankles.</p>

<p><p>I chilled for a bit like this, closed my eyes and felt the wind and sun. (I was smart enough to wear long sleeved shirt and pants, some great sunscreen!)</p>

<p><p>This didn&rsquo;t feel deep enough.  So I wrenched my feet out and dug deeper, fully covering my ankle bones and everything.  That was fun for a bit. I tried to jump, which stretched my back in a weird way that made me remember why I didn&rsquo;t like to jump while my feet are buried in sand.</p>

<p><p>How much deeper could I go?  I still had not used my hands to bury my feet, so I let my hands help with the holes this time. While I was digging, a particularly ambitious wave reached my excavation site, beginning the puddle formation.  This just helped me dig deeper so I did.</p>

<p><p>Finally I had my feet buried fully 1 foot deep.</p>

<p><p>I closed my eyes and meditated like a tree. Just experiencing the beach and nature around me. I decided I would not open them until someone came up to me, or until the surf reached me 3 times.</p>

<p><p>I peeked when I heard Wende&rsquo;s voice off in the distance.  Oops. I closed my eyes again, aware that she was approaching.
I didn&rsquo;t expect a gentle kiss on the lips from her.  Mmmm.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;HI&rdquo; we both said.</p>

<p><p>She was as tall as I, or something; she seemed to appreciate the extra foot the sand gave her.  The weird thing for me was that as I scanned the horizon, everything looked fine.  Then as I looked at the ground closer and closer to me&hellip;  Yeowzers! I&rsquo;m suddenly short!</p>

<p><p>I was probably out in that spot for a bit over an hour.</p>

<p><p>The youth had come by twice, and were playing out in the raft when I decided I had been a tree long enough. My feet tingled after I pulled them out of the sand; my hypothesis is the sand smooshed the blood out of them, so they kinda went to sleep.</p>

<p><p>The raft was fun; I helped them pull it out toward the breakers and against the prevailing tide, and once we were a ways out, let the waves whhhhhaaassshhh us back toward shore, sometimes tumbling one or two youth out of the raft.</p>

<p><p>A wonderful fun time was had by all.</p>

<p><p>We were soon called in for dinner, hotdogs, and meat or vegetarian burgers. I had a veggie burger and sat by Anna, giggling with her about rally stories and a joke.</p>

<p><p>I told the joke to the group.. it&rsquo;s my favorite entirely clean joke lately. Maybe I&rsquo;ll put it in here. Probably not.</p>

<p><p>Anna and I enjoyed it more than the rest of the group, and I&rsquo;m glad about that.</p>

<p><p>Pretty much after that we packed it up and went home. On the way back I rode with Wende, who had driven up separately because she had to go to work for a bit.</p>

<p><p>I don&rsquo;t remember what we talked about.</p>

<p><p></p>

<p>Today was Flower Communion at my church.  The service stems from
way back in Czechloslavakia when Norbert Capek (The 'C' character is
actually a C with a v on it.) a Unitarian minister, wanted to have a
communion but not using bread and wine.
<br> That's the short version of the story.</p>

<p>But that's not why I'm writing.

<p>Today after church, Mary McCuen and I, en route to Einstein
Bros. Bagels, talked about activities for the summer. This Wednesday
for our LRY dinner, we're going to invite all the youth from the seven
local UU churches to meet so we can plan some dates for meetings
during the summer!

<p>I'm super excited about actually doing to cluster level stuff,
getting the group together <em>doing</em> stuff together... I'm
excited about the possibilities.

<p>So I called Christina Branum-Martin and she said she was interested
in having youth worships during the summer. We now plan to have a
worship in the evening of each first Sunday of the month. Yay!

<p>I'm doing the smiley bouncy dance just thinking about it!</p>
