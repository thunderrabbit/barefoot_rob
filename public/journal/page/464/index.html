<p>Woke up around 9am and flopped around in bed a bit until I was all,
"whoah! Elise got a new bike!" and wanted to go ride bikes with her.
So I woke her ass up and she was all, "ride bikes?  But I just woke
up!"</p>

<p>"Me too!" but I should have noticed that she had been up long
enough to take her PJs off and clothes on.  "Actually I've been up for
a while, so you got more sleep than me, so let's go."</p>

<p>"I've been up for a while too," she admitted.</p>

<p>"C'mon c'mon c'mon" I pulled her out of bed.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>"Wow, you even have a helmet" she commented to me.</p>

<p>"Does this mean you <em>don't</em> have a helmet?"  I tried to
bully her into thinking she should get one.  "Don't you like your
little head?"</p>

<p>"Yeah,... But I only ride from Building A to Building B."</p>

<p>I conceded and said nothing.</p>

<p>"You have gloves too??"</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I rode around in circles outside, waiting for her to come out.
Visions of us going down to the school and riding around, maybe
playing a game of FTL, which we played for hours and hours back in the
day; me, Fred, Danny, Shannon, anyone else, all following the leader,
and whoever put their foot down had to go back to the end of the
line.  Along the curb, into little areas, up on benches (maybe not at
that age), up ramps and down steps, everywhere we could think of.  We
even designed a multimillion dollar complex with perfect obstacles
everywhere, and a floor that would light up as the leader bike wheels
rolled across it, so people would know exactly where they had to
ride.  What a fabulous time that would be.</p>

<p>Elise rode out on her bike, a bit tentatively.  "I've only had it
for two weeks.."</p>

<p>Turns out that she hasn't ridden a bike since she was 8 years old
or so.  Wow.</p>

<p>We rolled slowly down the road and she queried how many gears I have.</p>

<p>"Three and Eight."</p>

<p>"Wow.  I only have two and five."</p>

<p>??? no way.  I looked over and saw three sprockets on the front of
her bike.  "You have three up front."</p>

<p>We stopped at the stop sign at the end of the road and I inspected
her situation.  Her front shifter stays in low gear.  If she shifts it
up to middle gear it sometimes stays, but pretty much just snaps down
to first gear again.  It won't stay in high gear at all.  That's
fucked up.</p>

<p>I got on hers and found that I could hold the front gear on high
gear and it worked fine, but it won't stay there without being held.
I also noticed the pedals are not aligned correctly.  The pedal axels
are not parallel to the crankshaft axel.  That's fucked up.</p>

<p>In low gear I took off back toward Elise and instead of propelling
me forward, the chain slipped off the back sprocket and I tumbled over
the front of the bike to the ground.  That's fucked up.  That's also
why I wear a helmet.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Gently rode back to Elise, and was able to recreate the chain
slipping problem, but this time I didn't fall off.</p>

<p>Back onto my bike and am very thankful for its awesomeness.  That's
worth a few dollars more.</p>

<p>Sat down on my seat and the seat broke off.</p>

<p>"Goddammit!"  how many bike fuckups can happen in five minutes?</p>

<p>The bolt holding my seat to the stem simply sheared in two.  I put
all the pieces in my pocket (the seat in one pocket, the under-seat
pouch in my other pocket) rode back.</p>

<p>"Can you ride like that for very long?"</p>

<p>"Sure; I just gotta remember not to sit down."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>My dad had a good suggestion when I asked if he had a replacement.
"Get an aircraft grade bolt."  Excellent.</p>

<p>Went with Elise to get her bike fixed (just needed to tighten the
shifter) and then found a correctly sized bolt of hardened steel to
replace the one that broke out from under my bike seat.  29 cents plus
tax.</p>

<p>Drove by Tomball High School, the mammoth monstrosity of a school
that used to be small and cute to see if Mr Bandecca was there.  "He
left a long time ago" (years).  "Mr Reagh?" "no" "Mr Hamm?"  "He
retired last year."  "Mrs Roach?"  "Yes."  "Twitchell?" "No; she
teaches at the college now."</p>

<p>"So Mrs Roach is here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but she's in a class and you can't go visit her now.  She'll
be done at 2:30."</p>

<p>"What about between classes?"</p>

<p>"We have block schedule now.  The class ends at 2:30."</p>

<p>I left her a note and will go back at 2:30.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Elise and I scavanged for lunch and Elise was eating a cold pancake
from yesterday with almond butter on it.  Her mom walked by and was
all, "have a seat," in a way that sounded like, "we have to talk about
something that you did."  But she was just telling her to sit down to
eat.  What the fuck is that all about?  We're just grazing.  No
company to impress.  Damn.</p>

<p>Elise was like, "okay" and didn't do it.  At least she didn't do
it.  One day she'll just say no.</p>

<p>I'm at Jason's house now, but there's no Jason.  His roommate
LeeAnn (sp) let me in.  Hopefully it wasn't too uncomfortable for her
to have some guy sleeping in his car in their driveway when she drove
up.  She has a girl, about 2 years old maybe.  I have intentionally
not been too inquisitive until Leigh Anne (sp) knows for sure I'm
a-okay.  I did call Jason, though, and he was at his mom's house
(nearby) getting food, so I told him to bring some here.</p>

<p class=date>8:28pm</p>

<p>Jason and I have been talking; he told me all about the fucked up
situation with the ex-restaurant in Wimberley, which he used to own.
Turns out that the fat cat who bankrolled the whole operation is a
huge fraud and has no assets but protects himself by filtering tons of
money to corporations and trustfunds and shit that no one can touch.
Nothing is in his name; he's stolen people's identity and all kinds of
shit.  He's apparently a business law genius and uses it to screw the
fuck out of people via business.</p>

<p>Jason just dropped off the kids at the pool and now we're going to
hang with Shawn Tuthill.</p>

<p class=date>12:43am</p>

<p>Picked up Bryce and met Shawn and his girl Sarah at a cold bar with
a loud band and lots of TVs.  We watched a lot of X Games BMX and
motorbike stunts.  Some amazing stuff on there with double back flips
and no hand 900 on a 1/2 pipe.  Even the transitions between stunts
were stunts in themselves.  Incredible stuff.</p>

<p>Shawn's glass slipped and broke on the table.  Sarah flirted a new
drink from the bartender.  Jason and Bryce saw two girl friends from
junior high and hung out with them.  Shawn, Sarah and I left and they
dropped me off at Jason's house.</p>

<p>I gave Shawn two catalogs from Tuthill Motors, which I got from
Dennis' work when he was throwing away a lot of competitive
literature.</p>

<p>Shower for me and then bed.</p>

<p class=date>1:17am</p>

<p>And by "bed," I mean Jason and I are now watching Dogma.</p>

<p class=date>3:27am</p>

<p>Such a great movie.  Kevin Smith rules.  Jason fell asleep pretty
quickly.  This is my second time to see the movie, and I remember 1 or
2 lines I thought were really funny.</p>

<p>"That means Bethany is part black?"</p>

<p>and something else, but I don't remember it.</p>

<p>The end credits are on now.</p>

<p>"Sit down and pay your respects!"</p>

<p>Aw man, that's the one line they featured.  I really liked it
too.</p>

<p>Going to Houston now.  Jack is going with me.  Hugs to Joey, who is
now home alone.</p>

<p class=date>12:44pm</p>

<p>Jack and I forgot to stop by Rick's house on the way out.  We are
here now and about to leave again.</p>

<p class=message>jack here
<br>once we got back on the road rob took the initiative to cut the small
talk by asking some thought provoking conversation stimulating
questions.
<br>discussed my ire with the worlds general destructive ways.
<br>found out about some of robs spritual leanings. obviously something he
has put a lot positive solid  thought into. not an area ive explored much.
the conversation turned to games and rob told me about a game him and
kt once played in which  participants pronounce all the road signs
they see. we eventually played that a bit.
<br>talked about tulsa rally. we both gave the situation a solid grrrrr.
arranged to see meg robinson upon arrival.
<br>i asked a lot of questions about yruu history. rob was very helpful. 
gas and a small snack for me. 
<br>im lucky to have gotten the chance to have interesting dialogue.
<br>end jack</p>

<p class=date>5:29pm</p>

<p>We're at Meg Robinson's house now, and I'm going to leave soon,
with or without Jack, depending on if he cannot or can get another
ride to downtown.</p>

<p class=date>11:46pm</p>

<p>Left with Jack, but did not get him to the bus station quickly
enough for him to catch the 6:15pm bus to Beaumont.  Left him in the
parking lot across the street from the bus station and went to visit
Jennifer at Paint This! and drop off my (borrowed) unicycle at the
Schwinn shop to get the axel fixed.  It rotates inside the wheel hub
instead of being well attached.</p>

<p>HI to Jennifer and then followed her to her house to visit Spot,
and felt a bit nostalgic seeing him, and he wasn't all that super
excited to see me, but it's all good; he's a happy outdoor cat, and
I'm thankful for that.  He seems quite content in his new life.</p>

<p>Called Wende, but she wasn't home, so I called Maggie, but she
wasn't home, so I called Molly and went to her house.  Molly fed me a
boca burger with pickles, mayonnaise, lettuce on toasted buns.</p>

<p>Watched Discovery Channel about plans for a big ass cone shaped
building, a big ass mile long ship, and a big ass bridge over the
Gibraltar Straight.  We decided the building seemed most feasible.</p>

<p>Maggie arrived and I got to cuddle with her on the couch, which
reminded me of college days in her dorm studying physics, or watching
The Simpsons uabwmaah.</p>

<p>Left around 10pm for my dad's house to check my 2.5 inches worth of
snail mail, and say HI to Dad, Karen, and Elise.  Have just gone
through my snail mail with no real surprises.  I'm glad about
that.</p>

<p>Will talk with Elise tonight and then go get my (borrowed) unicycle
tomorrow and go ride around with Jason down in Clear Lake.</p>

<p class=date>1:26am</p>

<p>Hung out talking with Elise; she told me stories of cats and
kittens and a guy named Ryan who has the same birthday as hers, but
he's three years older.</p>

<p>I told her stories of my recent adventures, including Ad-Libs, and
the creation of the song Ants and Cheese.</p>

<p>Today has been a great YRUU day.  Marta and I went to church and
then YRUU at First Jefferson church in Fort Worth, and then drove

meeting first, starring Jackie, Kate, Megan) where we played Fruit
Basket, with the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Megan: Tomato (pronounced "to MAH to")</li>
<li>Sean: Mamachino</li>
<li>Marta: Cherry</li>
<li>Rob: Star Fruit (I'm a star.  fruit.)</li>
<li>Jordan: Pineapple</li>
<li>Sarah: Strawberry</li>
<li>Jon: Orange</li>
<li>Simon: Lime</li>
<li>Jackie: Pompamous ? (grapefruit(?) in French)</li>
<li>Neil: Habanero</li>
<li>Leigh: Tangelo</li>
<li>Kate: Nectarine</li>
<li>David: Sweet Pluma</li>
</ul>

<p>I think that's everyone.  Thanks to Marta for remembering them
all.</p>

<p>Simon kept picking on Jackie and tagging the shit out of her as
soon as someone said her fruit name.  So one time we played a round
with him in the center and wouldn't choose her fruit name.</p>

<p>An interesting thing happened that I saw happen with this game at
Fort Worth Rally 1998 (Son of Duck) when we played a stand up version
of this game called the Zoo Game where everyone chooses an animal.
That is the person in the middle would go really slowly, and not tag
people who were super slow, or even really try to play.  In my mind,
this brought down the energy of the game, and made it less interesting
to play.</p>

<p>Also interesting that I had just been at Ft Worth church earlier
that day.</p>

<p>I've just dropped off Marta at her house (since her car is sick)
and am driving back to Chez Bibby now.  (Not Chez, but the french word
for house).</p>

<p>Janette, Marta and I just got back from watching (I just lost at
Wahoo again) the 12:30am showing of Blue Crush, starring some cute
surfer girl(s) and one cute and some fat football players.  I cried at
the end when the other local girls were all, "can I have your
autograph?"  Ah, the simple things are beautiful.</p>

<p>Everytime they showed the underwater cracking head on coral scene I
was all cringing and had to remind myself that I was safe, in a
theater, watching a movie, Oww fuck that hurts!  oh, I'm safe, in a
theater, watching a movie..</p>

<p>It was good.  XXX was better.</p>

<p>"You're going to surf wearing that?"</p>

<p>"Naw, I'm going to surf wearing my dudantada."</p>

<p>"Your what?"</p>

<p>"My," rips off shorts revealing a speedo, "Dudan Tada!!!"</p>

<p>"heehee you're wearing a nut hugger!"</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>So much fun going out so late on a church night!  Whooo!</p>

<p>Outside now on the front porch; had been talking with Janette and
now talking with Katherine (sp) and Tara as well.  K is getting
married soon to a guy her age (43) which apparently is statistically
rare.</p>

<p>Yay!  Meg Cusack buzzed her hair!  Fuzzy fuzzy fuzzy.</p>

<p>I just rode my bike for a couple hours.  Rode to the lake to the
park where Sean and I first rode bikes around the lake.  Rolled up and
over the teeter totter just to see if I could do it with less fear
this time.  Did it.  Discovered that the weird wall thing down by the
lake is like the facing of some public baths, except the baths are
just concrete sidewalks on top of the lake water, so the lake water is
splashing all around the shore as it does, except there were sidewalks
and a roof above it.  I rolled through one of the many doors in the
wall, out onto a sidewalk with water lapping all around and then rode
out.  Hmmm.</p>

<p>Rode to the nearby Dallas Waterworks building, and then rode along
the slanted concrete of the lake side of a wall designed to keep
people and bikes on the non-lake side.  It was a bit trickier than
last time I rode it due to vegetation growing down the wall.  I didn't
want to ride across it because it would almost certainly provide less
traction than the concrete and possibly send me sliding down into the
water, and I didn't want to get wet.</p>

<p>Picked my bike up over the wall and rode down the other side of the
incline along the non-forbidden side of the fence guarding the
forbidden spillway.  Around the spillway and then up the hill.  At the
top of the hill I turned around and zipped down as quickly as I could,
just to see quite how fast I could go down.  Okay fast, maybe even
pretty fast, but not crazy fast.</p>

<p>Back up the hill again, and this time I waited for a break in
traffic on the six lane road beside the lake.  Got the break then
dropped off the curb into the street to buzz down the hill, but bang
the traffic light was allowing traffic out of some neighborhood so it
was red, so I aborted the mission.  Rode back up to the top of the
hill and when I got my break in traffic, the light stayed green for
me, and it was all good.  But still not crazy fast.</p>

<p>Back up the hill again and then along the lake a little bit and
when the sidewalk turned left along the lake, I turned right across
the six lane street and rolled into a relatively nice neighborhood
with tall trees and limited traffic.</p>

<p>Slow slow riding through the neighborhood and discovered a little
alley way type thing that seemed to run forever behind some of the
houses, a long shared driveway with backyards of houses all along it.
Rolled a few blocks down this alley, greeted by boistrous dogs with
barks less like "have a nice day," and more like "get your ass out of
my alley."</p>

<p>Reached a big puddle in the alley, but it was near a street with a
house under construction, so I rode through the yard so as not to get
wet.  Soon thereafter, I reached the end of the alley, and turned
right toward the lake.</p>

<p>The alley let me rest my legs, so I was pretty much hauling bootay
as I left the neighborhood, especially considering I was going
downhill toward the lake.  I looked up and that same traffic light
that had been green for the neighborhood traffic was again green for
the neighborhood traffic, about 5 cars of which were entering the
intersection in front of me.  I hauled ass to make the light and was
pretty much at top speed pedaling in my top gear (3-8) as I hauled ass
turning left through the yellow light across the six lane street and
down the hill.  Almost super fast, but not crazy fast as I felt fully
in control at all times.  Just pump pump pump pump through the
intersection head down butt up turning on pavement clean and dry,
nothing to let me slip.  Fantastic timing.  Wonderful.</p>

<p>I slowed and re-engaged the lake bike path, saw a female rider in
front of me also on a mountain bike.  Considered talking to her, but I
had to just catch up to her first.  She took the gentle incline up to
the wall, and I tried to muscle my way straight up the incline, but
gravel strewn all over it kept me from making it.  She also took the
gentle incline down the sidewalk near the waterworks, and I dared
myself to go raargh down the steeper dangerouser grass and gravel
incline at an angle to beat her to the bottom.</p>

<p>I chickened out for a while, but then did it straight down the
incline and not at an angle, which was certainly easier in some ways.
I found myself on the wrong side of some holly at the bottom and had
to pick my bike up over that to get over to the sidewalk again.  Back
on the sidewalk, I lost track of the girl.</p>

<p>I guessed she was going around the lake, so I continued that way,
back to the park where Sean and I first rode around, and where I
started my adventure today.  I saw her a hundred meters or so in front
of me, so I set off to catch her.</p>

<p>Tired tired tired, ride ride ride, but I had a goal in mind, to
catch up to this girl, which after not tooo long I did.   And I just
swooshed on past her because I had gotten up some good speed.  My legs
felt pretty strong, and I was breathing slowly, completely filling my
chest with each breath.  Just in the moment, riding my bike really
fast around a lake.</p>

<p>Should I go all the way around?  Hmmm.  I didn't really have a way
to guess which way would be closer to get back if I decided to turn
around.  I kept going.  Riding riding riding, passing some people,
getting passed by some road bikes on the road, with their thin tall
tires and spandex shorts.</p>

<p>Caught up with the road bikes when they slowed down to stop or turn
around and then I headed up an incline and then along another roadway
along the lake, presumably on the opposite side of the lake from the
first one.  Down a steep incline to get back to the lake level, past
some people fishing and such.</p>

<p>I wondered if this boat launch area would be where Janette had her
kayak lesson scheduled for later today.  Riding slowly, looking, and
there she was, with Richard Fine, who make money teaching kayaking.  I
said HI to them just as they were putting the kayak into the water.
Perfect exquisite timing.  Amazing.</p>

<p>They were busy kayaking and such so I began my ride again, looked
up and the girl had just ridden past me.  Amazing timing.  Again.</p>

<p>Nearly caught up with her again and then she took off toward the
left away from the lake.  I chose not to follow her, but continued my
trek around the lake and stopped at a building right on the lake that
Sean and I had visited and looked through the free binocular telescope
thing.  I aimed it back at Janette and Richard, but they were in a bay
with trees blocking my view of them.  I scanned along the shoreline of
the lake and discovered the water works building way over on the left
of straight across the lake, meaning I had gone well more than 1/2 way
around the lake at this point.  I was inspired that my adventure was
close to completion.  I was tired!</p>

<p>Back on bike path again, riding slowly then carefully gaining
speed, and saw in front of me.. the girl on the bike.  Caught up with
her and said HI as I passed her, and then realized hey, she's probably
going around the entire lake; I wonder if she knows how big around it
is.  So I slowed down and asked her as she caught up to me.  She
didn't know.  But she did say that she had walked around it once, and
it took her 3 hours 20 minutes.  At 3 miles per hour, that makes it 10
miles around.  At 4 miles per hour, that makes it a tad over 13 miles
around.  I'm guessing she was closer to 4 than 3 since she is
obviously in relatively good shape, so it probably close to 13 miles
around.  Cool.  She added, "that was the last time I ever walked
around it."</p>

<p>I rode sort of beside her kinda, but not for much longer as she
lifted her fingers off her handle grip to wave as she turned left
toward her vehicle.  "See you later," I said.</p>

<p>Made it around the lake back to the first hill I had hauled down a
couple of times and this time more bike and foot traffic clogged the
area so it was a bit dangerous to go way fast, but I still went pretty
darn fast considering how tired I was.</p>

<p>Down the hill, across the bridge, up the small hill (using a 2 lane
street as a U-turn braking area to slow my descent) and then back onto
the bike path.  Now I was way tired.  And though this section of
sidewalk is flat and almost level, it's a slight grade going up, and I
certainly felt it.  Push push push, past a girl walking in the middle
of the path while wearing headphones to block the outside world.  Made
it past the sidewalk, and then barrelled up the grassy slightly rough
and rocky field to the street and back into the neighborhood near the
Bibby's house.</p>

<p>Low gear like 2-2 going up a steep hill, but I kept my legs moving
and my bike rolling.  No time to give up yet.  Push push push up the
hill, down a slight hill, up another hill, down a slight hill, up a
slight hill and now I was in 2-1 or lower maybe 1-3 or 1-4.  Rolled to
a stop in the shade of a big tree.  Gloves off, helmet off, backpack
off, water in.  Drink rest drink rest.</p>

<p>Tired, but rested, I re-engaged my equipment and bike, rode the
remaining six or seven blocks home.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Fantastically, Rick saw me coming up and opened the door for me.
Excellent welcome back to home base.  Then more pleasant surprises to
find Paul Andrews and Meg Cusack playing Wahoo with Joey!  HI to them
and rubbed Meg's fuzzy head and then again two more times after asking
permission.</p>

<p>Joey needed to go to the train(?) station to go see Laura, so Rick
was here to pick her up.  I finished out Joey's position in the game
of Wahoo and knocked one of Meg's balls back home and then Paul won,
and I (as Joey) came in second.  Meg mocked a single tear.</p>

<p>Game over, they were ready to head back to Tyler, and then Meg was
going to Houston.  I wish them safe travels!</p>

<p class=date>5:41pm</p>

<p>1 hour 3 minutes to type all the above.</p>

<p>I'm going to take a shower and then at 6:30 Cris is supposed to be
here with Marta and we're going to Jenae's party at Monica's
restaurant, and then Marta is staying here tonight and I'll take her
to Plano church tomorrow and then drop her off in Denton (her car has
recently died; seems to be electrical problems.)</p>

<p>Cris and Laura brought Marta to the Bibby's and we caravanned to
Monica's Aca y Alla restaurant for Jenae's birthday party.  Jenae had
had so much fun at Marta's 10000th day party last week that she wanted
to do it again...</p>

<p>This time the party was 16 people and I was sitting next to and
across from stinky smokers except for Marta and Jenae.  It was still
fun though.</p>

<p>Jenae, being the birthday girl, got a shot of tequila poured right
into her mouth (out of a bottle from the bar) by the cute hostess
person who was there again tonight.  I didn't get a picture; I didn't
have my camera; pooh.</p>

<p>Katy, a friend of Marta's who attended Marta's 10000th day
celebration at Monica's (the restaurant), was there again tonight,
which is ironic since she (Katy) was with a different group.  Marta
had considered bringing her (Katy's) Vagina Monologues T-shirt to the
restaurant and then calling Katy to say, "hey come get your shirt,"
(since she (Katy) lives really close to the restaurant (Monica's)) but
decided it was too presumptious to think Katy would have nothing else
planned for tonight.  Funny.</p>

<p>As we were leaving, Katy shouted to me, "Take care of my Marta!"
which is the same thing she pleaded to me last week (over and over).
Alcohol seems to have given her a one track mind.</p>
