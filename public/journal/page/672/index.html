                        <p><title>Houston Rally 1998</title></p>

<p class=date>16-18 January 1998</p>
<p>

After a few weeks of receiving registrations via mail and phone and
fax and email, we had 111 youth registrations and 22 adult
registrations.  I received 7 registrations on the Friday the rally
began.  Holy cow what a huge rally!
<p>
Friday morning I picked up the T-shirts bearing our controversial
"Imagine the Cat in the Hat Burning the Flag" title and image of a
seedy looking cat holding a lighter.  In the background is an American
flag except the stars are replaced by a large question mark.  I had
ordered and picked up 130 shirts.
<p>
Friday day Denise and I spent $520 buying a lot of food.
<p>
Friday night the people started pouring in.  Everything stayed calm
and stable, but just slowly wound up and up as more people arrived.
At 1am we had a rally virgin opening circle and it went a little long
as I couldn't think of what I wanted to say.  I think we got it all
covered and it was all good.
<p>
Opening circle for the whole rally was at 2am, and I tossed Jon W-L
out in the middle of the circle and said, "go for it," assuming he
knew what to say.  So opening circle was a bit shaky, but still fun
and funny.  At one point, Arlene D was hollering something about
something while we were trying to define the No Sex rule.  I hollered
over toward her from my <em><b>Pulp Fiction</b></em> favorite quote list, "tell that
bitch to chill! .. Tell her 'chill, bitch, chill!' ... Yolanda!
Yolanda!  What's Fonzie like?  Dassright!  he's coool.  and that's
what we're going to be.  we gonna be cooool."  Kim S is the only
person I saw who noticed and knew what it was from.
<p>
After opening circle, double chaos began as I let everyone go at the
same time to their touch groups, and no one knew who was in their
touch group and it was nuts.  The rally had begun like crap and I was
feeling a bit responsible.
(let this be a lesson if you're designing a rally: give everyone a
bead or something that tells what group they're in, *or* send each
group out one at a time by calling each individual's name.)
<p>
After helping people get to their touch groups, I finally made it to
mine and helped Anna M out a bit and we had a great touch group.
<p>
I stayed up talking with people and stuff until like 4:30am.
<p>
My internal rally-clock woke me up excited after sleeping 3.5 hours; I
went to wake up Charlotte, the touch group leader in charge of making
breakfast.  I found her in the kitchen with her touchgroup and
breakfast was practically made!!!  Yay!!  All the anxiety I felt about
the chaotic start of the rally flittered away like happy butterflies.
<p>
I bounced around talking to others who had woken up and many who had not
slept yet.
<p>
Later I was talking to a few advisors outside.  We had been talking
about emotions and the meaning of life when Charlie G had just brought
up the book _Conversations with God_ by Neale Walsch. I told him I
hadn't read it, but was interested.  He commented that bringing up
that book makes people leave the conversation because no one wants to
talk about it.  "Hmmm," I thought.
<p>
Soon Daniel or someone ran up and was all, "Rob!  We're playing
Ultimate over in the parking lot!"<br>
Cool. As I left to play, Charlie was all, "see- it clears the table
because no one wants to talk about it."<br>
My brain jerked back, "what?" Holy moly..  He had just said bringing
up the book would clear the table, I promptly disbelieved that and
forgot about it and left the table.  Wow!
<p>
During Ultimate, we had great fun, even playing while the disc had a
big crack in it.  We even played two short spontaneous games after the
disk was broken, claiming the bigger section was worth three-quarters
of a point, and I was part of the group playing for one-quarter of a
point.
<p>
At 2:30 or so, our theme speaker, Warren Apel from Arizona, talked
about First Amendment rights, including but not condoning flag
desecration.  The workshop was well attended, and quite informative.
I slept through about 1/2 of it.
<p>
I was in YAC meetings for much of the afternoon.  We selected the
youth staff for this coming SWUUSI.  I don't remember everyone who was
selected, but I do remember that Maia C and Ashley R are the co-deans,
Nathan R is the worship coordinator, Jen C is the mugbook editor, Nick
C is the special events coordinator, Adam L is the spirit leader, and
that's all I remember.  Congratulations to all who were selected!!
<p>
Soon we needed to have a YRUU meeting to vote for YAC positions. All
the YAC candidates presented their ad-lib speeches and everyone needed
to vote.
<p>
I had a bit of a logistics problem:<br>
<ul>
<li>We needed all the youth to vote for 3 YAC positions.</li>
<li>People in the kitchen had just gotten vegetarian food ready (after I
totally screwed up and didn't have any for the main dinnertime).
</li>
<li>The special event was ready to go.</li>
</ul>
<p>
I felt greatly pleased with how the transition turned out.  I
announced, "okay!  That's all the YAC candidates!  Now you get to vote
on your favorite 3.  And after you vote, you can eat vegetarian in the
kitchen!"  Everything went smoothly, everyone got to eat, and the
special event was inflated.  Yay!!!!
<p>
From the general youth perspective, I believe the best part of the
rally was our special event.  Jason Fricke's idea was to rent a
"Bouncy Boxing" thing.  It's one of those air-filled "moonwalk" deals
except the participants wear enormous soft boxing gloves and bounce
around and wail on one another.
<p>
To see the folded red canvas in the middle of the room slowly swell
into a fully huge bouncy boxing ring was incredible.  We had not told
anyone what was growing to be the special event.  I loved it.
I never challenged anyone to boxing, but I jumped and jumped about 5
different times with various people.  It was the most fun I've had in
a long while.
<p>
The Bouncy Boxing was there from like 9:15 till just after midnight,
when everyone was asked to gather for the worship.  The youth had
designed another wonderful experience, building the spiritual
community to new levels of wonderfulness.
<p>
About an hour later, we gently sang our way back to the main hall for
random mingling and then the talent show!
<p>
Kristian S did a hilarious parody of Marilyn Manson's "Sweet Dreams"<br>
Sean and Steve performed one of their old rally classics, plus "Dead
Puppies" (another rally classic) and Sean sang "If I Ever Fall in
Love" a capella.<br>
Some youth recited their own emotionally harsh poetry and Mary S
dramatized a suicide to Tori Amos' song "Marianne."<br>
I performed "cool and creamy" with Jen C, singing and resulting in
whipped cream all over one another.  You should have been there!<br>  As
we cleaned that up, Aaron I and Kristian S performed Madonna's "Like a
Prayer" and some others.<br>
I got to drum for Mike N rapping, *and* Jen C & Dane D did part III of
San Antonio Saki, with Kristian S and I lip synching their words and
other sound effects.  Very funny... especially Kris.<br>
Then Shira (I think) performed her most annoying sound and the show
kinda fizzled from there.
<p>
Then we had a SWUUSI 1997 dance relapse with the wacky Seasame Street
song (I still don't know who performs that) twice!!!!  What an
incredible energy drain is that song!
Then Korn (I don't know what song) was played several times and I stayed
up cleaning with some youth for about 1.5 hours.
I greatly appreciate their help.
<p>
I slept from 4:30am to 6:00am.  
<p>
We groggily got up at 6 to clean clean clean and amazingly, by 8am, the
place was perfect. 
Closing circle out in the parking lot and I was deeply emotionally
touched when I hugged Charlie G and he gave me a beautiful hardback copy
of <em>Conversations With God</em>.   
<p>
What a perfect touch to a perfect weekend!</p>

<p class=date>3:07pm Saturday 10 January 1998</p>

<p><font size=-1>(transcribed from my diary)</font>
<p>
I just had an incredible experience at Kathy Fey&rsquo;s.  She is my body work professional type person, using Cranio-Sachral balancing, Reiki (sp) and massage to keep my body happy.
<p>
I&rsquo;ve been doing body work with her for a while and today she focused on my left hip. There&rsquo;s been a bit of nagging almost pain there and to determine what is the deal with it, we did a &ldquo;dialogue.&rdquo;
<p>
I went to my meditation hill in my mind and sat gently there for a bit.  Then Kathy invited someone to help guide us with the process.  A woman in white walked up and when prompted, invited us to refer to her as Mother.
<p>
Kathy asked about the source of the injury and I visioned a stabbing downward from behind with a bayonette during a war. Someone stabbed me back there and I collapsed during the Civil War and I wasn&rsquo;t able to see my family and I felt so sad and cried and cried on her table.  I drug my body dragging my left leg and ended up in the woods, falling asleep at night and dying that night.
<p>
Kathy asked if I could see who had stabbed me and I saw his face, green hat and brown moustache and it was Forest! in a previous life who had stabbed me.  Before I recognized him I forgave him and was really surprised when I saw who it was.  I explained to Kathy how I know him this lifetime.
<p>
We called to the hill anyone that I wronged during the war and about 7 or 12 men were there.  I felt I did not see their faces when I killed them as they were too far away.  I suspect I shot them.  I asked them all for forgiveness and was forgiven by some but not by all the men.
<p>
We let them go about their way and asked Mother if we could release the tension in my hip.  She said Yes but not as quickly as I would like.  We asked if there was anything else and she said she was so proud of me and my work.  I cried and cried again to hear that.  Wonderful
<p>
Mother had to leave so we thanked her and let her go.  We need only ask to have her return.
<p>
Wow.  I was amazed by the experience.  Part of me wants proof but I am currently content to believe it is precisely true.</p></p>

<p class=date>3:30am Wednesday 7 January 1998</p>

<p><font size=-1>(transcribed out of my diary)</font>
<p>
This has been a great evening.<br>
After the funeral and getting to ride in the limosuine, the most tear jerking thing was the bagpipes playing &ldquo;Amazing Grace&rdquo; as we left the church.  I almost cried.<br>
The burial ground was all sloppy muddy squishy cause it was raining just like at Monner&rsquo;s funeral.
<p>
We bummed around the Ockley house this night and ate and talked and Peter, Neil, Kim and I talked about chit chatty stuff and had a delightful time.  I greatly believe we cousins will begin to get together more often.
<p>
I showed everyone the genealogy I copied and gave Martin his copy and will copy more for others who want copies.
<p>
Finally we cousins left: Peter, Neil, Kim and I to get a VCR and movies and came to the hotel and we all congregated: me, Fred, Bridgette, Buddy, Matt, Peter, Neil &amp; Kim to watch our crazy videos and <em>Pulp Fiction</em>.
<p>
We had a great time and really fun wrestling on the beds, talking about old times, and planning to meet again soon.
<p>
At one point, the following conversation happened:
<p>
Fred: &ldquo;Yeah, but a bigger penis doesn&rsquo;t hurt.&rdquo;<br>
Bridgette: &ldquo;Sometimes it does.&rdquo;<br>
(laughter)<br>
Rob: &ldquo;Yeah- I hear that all the time.&rdquo;<br>
Bridgette: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t need to hear that!&rdquo;<br>
Fred: &ldquo;<b>I</b> never tell you that.&rdquo;<br>
Rob: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s &lsquo;cause you&rsquo;re used to Pete.&rdquo;<br>
Bridgette: &ldquo;I <em>really</em> didn&rsquo;t need to hear that!!&rdquo;
<p>
That was like 1am or so and we were really laffin crazy hard.
<p>
We determined the crazy fun videos span 4 years, but they are fully 10 years old!!!!!!!!!!<br>
We definitely need to get together more often.
<p>
As <em>Pulp Fiction</em> ended, it was 3am.  Matt and Buddy almost freaked (a lot or a little?) and were all &ldquo;oh my god we can&rsquo;t wake up in only 5 hours!! blah blah blah&rdquo; and Pete was all, &ldquo;Aunt Jean told me not to let you stay up too late and I&rsquo;ll kick your ass if I get in trouble for you not waking up on time.&rdquo;
<p>
Pete and I laffed and gave each other five.  Heh heh.  Still the older cousins!  HA!!!</p></p>

<p class=date>Happy New Year!!</p>

<p>
For the New Year's celebration, I went to a lock-in with the youth group, organized by Anna M.  Present were Dane D, Zach R, Jon W, Christina L, Andrew Z, Anna M, Jon M, Jim M, Christina M, Zola M, and me, Rob N.  (Sounds like the attendance list of a 12-step group!)
<p>
We had great fun setting of fire-crackers and oops one bottle rocket, but no roman candles, much to Jon W's chagrine.
<p>
We watched the Southpark episode with Kathie Lee Gifford (sp) and it was HIlarious.  Super great fun..  Not as hilarious was MAD TV, but I suffered through it.
<p>
Right now I am at <a href=https://www.LiquidLab.hypercon.com>Liquid Lab</a> which has ISDN internet connection for 5 bucks per hour.  Cool.  I've got ISDN at my apartment, but hey, I'm meeting a couple of people and dammit, if I'm <b>paying</b> to write, then I have much greater incentive to do so!!
<p>
Present here are: Sony (behind the counter), Kimberly (at a table), Tony (the owner).  Oh and me.   They have DJ Sun spin techno beats on Saturdays at 9:30 pm. Pretty cool.  Come check it out; I'll likely be here tomorrow.  Unless I'm scheduled already.
<p>
And that's it!  Have a super great day!

<p><ul>

This weekend I purchased a car.  I bought a 1990 Toyota Camry, 5 speed manual transmission, 94242 miles, beautifully clean silver exterior and grey velure interior.
<p>
Wende and I had just looked again at the first Camry I looked at.  I was all, &ldquo;welll ..  maybe I&rsquo;ll get it.&rdquo;  Wende suggested that we go see what was available at the Toyota dealership we happened to be passing.
<p>
It was 9pm when we walked in. I told Stan I wanted a 1989 or 90 Camry and he went to check.  They had just received one that day at 4pm. Nice.<br>
We went to see the car, and Stan said their mechanics had not looked at it yet and he had no idea what to expect.  We found the car to be immaculately clean and Wende hopped in the driver&rsquo;s seat.  She couldn&rsquo;t start it.  &ldquo;Push the clutch all the way in,&rdquo; we suggested. Nothing. Stan tried and it started no problem.  Hmmm.
<p>
So I drove us around and we found that the left turn signal didn&rsquo;t work quite properly, and the right front tire was out of balance.  Other than that the car&rsquo;s cool. <font size=-2>( - Jules in <em>Pulp Fiction</em>)</font>
<p>
We got back to the lot and I announced firmly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it!&rdquo; because my inner me said YES for sure. (Other cool things: there is an &ldquo;evolve&rdquo; fish with legs on the back, and a blood donor sticker on one window, and umbrella &amp; windshield shade in the back seat)
<p>
Stan quoted $5000 plus or minus $300 depending on what the mechanics find.
<p>
(I&rsquo;ll keep the story short)
<p>
The next day, I signed papers for $5300 + TT&amp;L for the car.  They had to replace the clutch, and the A/C compressor.  The wheels were still out of balance so the next day I got two new front tires and they fixed the left turn signal. Bonus. Partytime.  I am <em>happy</em>!
<p>
I named the car Scott.
</li>
<p>
<li>
Last night Scott and I went to my dad&rsquo;s house for Christmas celebration with my brother Fred. No tree, no muss, no fuss, just hugs and love and a few gifts.  Fred and I had the most fun with a set of colored blocks that are a gift for Noah, our first cousin once removed.
</li>
<p>
<li>
This morning, my dad and I went grocery shopping. I enjoyed spending the time talking with him.
</li>
<p>
<li>
On the way home today, Scott and I witnessed an accident. I parked Scott and hopped out to take notes. A Blazer had smashed into a pickup truck that hadn&rsquo;t yet moved at a green light, and another pickup truck slightly smashed into the Blazer.
<p>
The cops arrived fairly quickly and I gave them my version of the story and my phone number and stuff.
</li>
<p>
<li>
Now I&rsquo;m at work watching to make sure the computers stay happy.
<p>
When I leave in a couple hours, it will be straight to my mom&rsquo;s house in College Station, 1.5 hours away.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Happy Winter Solstice.<br>

                        <h1>1997 Little Rock rally review by Rob</h1>

<hr>

<p><p>
5 - 007 December 1997
<p>
The Little Rock Rally was, of course, absolutely incredible.<br />
<p>
I didn&rsquo;t look forward to the 9.5 hour drive, but as I expected, the
conversation was plenty invigorating to keep us chatting the entire
way up there.  In the rental car was Cathy S, KT H and I.  I brought
up a question that&rsquo;s been bouncing through my head for a while.
<p>
What are emotions?  Best I can tell is they <em>must</em> be experienced, and
maybe emotions are the reason we are alive.  The conversation turned
toward to What are instincts?  Are they related to emotions?
<p>
Notice how on an evolutionary scale, instincts (of a mosquito or
&ldquo;lesser&rdquo; animal) seem to be replaced by the emotions of dogs and humans
and other &ldquo;greater&rdquo; animals..  Hmmm..
<p>
(If you are intrigued, write me back and I&rsquo;ll send you my essay on the
subject)
<p>
We got there and it was <strong>cold</strong>!!  Well, chilly and late.. about 1:30
in the AM, I believe.  The rally craziness indicator was at a low
simmer.  Marc L and Tera L (different Ls) were already there and I was
glad to talk with them for a while.  Marc taught us some new songs and
games. &ldquo;Little Sally Walker&rdquo; was one song we learned that night.
<p>
Opening circle was cool.  Everyone tossed in their shoes and then we
all chose someone else&rsquo;s shoes and thereby randomly selected our new
neighbors in the circle, and the order in which we introduced
ourselves.  After that, we just stayed up late yakin&rsquo; and talkin&rsquo; and
having a lovely time.  I crashed at about 5 AM or so..
<p>
The next day I joined a group playing <em>Assassin</em> and got promptly
tagged by Tera the first game.  I did better in the second game,
chasing Max around the parking lot for a bit.  That was a good
stretch, especially since I was running barefoot, and I haven&rsquo;t
otherwise been going barefoot much lately.
<p>
We also played <em>Animal Tag</em> and that was pretty fun..  Oh yeah!  We
played a small game of <em>Wink</em> and then a game of <em>Slaughter</em>, which one
of the other advisors taught me.
<p>
The YAC meeting was longer that most of our previous in-rally
meetings, but we had a lot to cover.  We YACked about the age limits
and brainstormed some ideas on how to convince the board to allow them
to be 14-20.
<p>
Dinner was a delightful ordeal for me.  I got to sit by Marc L and we
sat patiently waiting for our food while writing and drawing on the
huge spread of butcher paper on the table before us.
<p>
When our salad came, I immediately used my fork and grabbed a bite off
Marc&rsquo;s plate.  So he had a bite off my plate.  We continued this, and
actually ate our entire dinners from the other&rsquo;s plate.  The various
people (adults and young adults) serving us would shake their heads
gently as if to say, &ldquo;whatever makes you happy&rdquo; as Marc and I would
refer to each other in 3rd person to ask the servers for food for the
other..  Does that make sense?  Nope.. You should have been there!!
<p>
We had delicious fun.
<p>
After dinner, (I believe it was after dinner) Tera L, Marc L, Kat J
and I were chillin&rsquo; in the sanctuary.  Marc&rsquo;s eyes suddenly
brightened, &ldquo;we should make a fort out of chairs!&rdquo;
Crazy!  Brilliant.
<p>
We unstacked and aligned a few chairs when Marc and Tera announced
they were going to build their own fort and we could have a war!
<p>
Kat and I randomly grabbed sleeping bags and carefully placed the
chairs to hold the bags as our roof.  With permission, we used Mark
A&rsquo;s massage table, which turned out to be a great part of our
fortress.
<p>
After not too long, Tera ran over to our side to spy on us or
something equally benign, and I captured her as our first prisoner!  I
led her into our fort, and underneath the massage table to her jail
cell.  She escaped without too much trouble, so we reinforced it with
more chairs and stuff.
<p>
The playfulness was delightful.  Kat was captured at least twice, and
at one point we had both Marc and Tera in our jail.
<p>
But the very funniest thing was when I was following one of our
prisoners into the fort and instead of going straight to the jail,
they stood up through a hole in the top (designed for throwing socks)
and climbed right out!
<p>
Yes, you had to be there.
<p>
I was dragging tired and had to miss the worship service, which I
believe was led by Marc.  I would have enjoyed attending, but I had to
<em>sleep</em>!
<p>
I was gently woken by some youth (I think Anna M and KT H) who really
really really wanted me to see the Talent Show.  I felt greatly loved
and went right up there.
<p>
Marc and Meghan R had just finished a whipped cream skit.  I was
going to be Marc&rsquo;s partner in it, but I was sleepin&rsquo;.<br />
Whew..  It woulda been fun, but I was glad to remain whipped-cream-less.
<p>
I don&rsquo;t remember much of what I saw at the talent show; my contacts
were out and my brain was sleeping.
<p>
The next morning after closing circle where we handed out Houston
Rally Registration forms (send me email if you want one) and sang and
had a great time, several youth stayed for Marc L&rsquo;s sermon.
<p>
The topic was &ldquo;Sacred Silliness,&rdquo; describing the value of silliness in
spiritual and emotional growth, especially as it applies to YRUU.
Afterwards I asked if we could put it on the webpage.  With an
emphatic &ldquo;yes!&rdquo; Marc said he would mail it to me (but I haven&rsquo;t gotten
it yet!!!  (MARC, ARE YOU READING??))
<p>
As we collected in the parking lot for the trip home, youth from OKC
and Cathy S and KT H were all goofing around.  It was decided we would
take Scott to Houston and they would take Cathy to OKC.  Nancy M was
all, &ldquo;wha???  OKC is not exactly on the way to Houston,&rdquo; not
recognizing that we were jokin&rsquo;.
<p>
We did, however, join them for lunch at Subway, extending the rally
love one more hour.  Scott gave me a big swig of the Groovy Juice and
KT got to drive the car (don&rsquo;t tell!) from our parking spot to the pay
phone and back.  (a whole 500 feet!)
<p>
The weather rained on the way home, but we had big fun.  The best game
we played was &ldquo;Read All The Traffic Signs On The Side Of The Road.&rdquo;
Read all the words and say what the symbol signs mean (&ldquo;merge left&rdquo;,
&ldquo;slippery when wet&rdquo;) and say &ldquo;dot&rdquo; for each small circular reflector.
Design your own such game!  It was enough to keep us entertained for
50 minutes, the entire way from before Conroe till we got into Houston
area.
<p>
Amazing fun and see you all at Houston Rally!!
<p>

                        <h1>1997  Little Rock rally review by Cathy</h1>

<hr>

<p><p></p>

<p>woke up and went to lamar with my mom to get my college day shit out of
the way; wrote a review of scrooge for my brother, and bitched at my boss
for scheduling me to work sunday.  rode to houston, cruzed rob&rsquo;s &lsquo;hood
with my parents waiting for him to get home; got to his house and saw ROB
IN PANTS!  scary.  then he immediately changed into shorts (he&rsquo;s rob
isn&rsquo;t he?)
<p>
then we went to rob&rsquo;s workplace to drop off his computer.  i waited in
the car.  Isn&rsquo;t it scary to think about rob working all day??  then we
went to taco cabana and ate and then we went to emerson to pick up KT.
then we started on the road and of course rob got us in one of his
wonderful/amazing/deep conversations.  the subject of this one was
emotions.   we kept riding and then we stopped at a gas station and i&rsquo;m
all &ldquo;um rob&ndash;i know this is a no smoking rally but what about now??&rdquo;  so
i smoked and ate chocolate and then we kept on riding sooooo long.  then
we stopped at another very strange gas station/convenience
store/restaurant/i dunno animal trophy display.  there were deer heads
everywhere and there was also a live snake, a huge snake.  weird.  then
we rode some more then we <em>finally</em> got there.
<p>
i walked up and saw carina!  what a surprise!  then i came in and saw
susanne and aaron and tiffany.  yay.  everyone was really laid back
though.  then all of a sudden a maia and a jeremy were running at me with
open arms (maia later told me that her and jeremy were sitting and jeremy
was like &ldquo;houston needs to get here&rdquo; and maia said &ldquo;check the door&rdquo; and
me and rob and kt were there. more proof that maia truly is the bomb).
then i was being hugged from behind by an unknown person who turned out
to be austin.  yay.  then me and austin and maia and jeremy did this 4
person hug for a good while.  then max and nancy got there double yay.
then i saw arlene!  yay yay yay.<br />
<p>
man what else?  opening circle.  then everyone awake started playing mau
or however you spell it and me and nancy were like that sucks so we
started sliding around on the floor in our socks and nancy fell down.  it
was so very funny.  :-)
<p>
um what else.  hung out with everyone.  like everyone was sleeping on the
Friday night!  what the fuck?? i think me and jeremy were the only ones
who stayed up the whole time.  nancy stayed awake most of the time.  in
the morning me and jeremy and nancy went outside to watch the sun rise.
then, when everyone was sleeping me and jeremy and nancy were being very
evil.  we found some big ass bubble wrap in the kitchen and started
popping it really loudly in the sanctuary where everyone was sleeping.
they weren&rsquo;t exactly happy with us.  then i lay down in the hall with
jeremy and melissa and nancy.  oh my god&ndash;me and jeremy wrapped melissa
up in her sleeping bag and like folded her body over and she looked like
a little baby.  so cute/funny!  breakfast was good; we got to see all
those silly people who slept.  we were making fun of austin for eating
cookies in his cereal.  what a weirdo.<br />
<p>
then me and jeremy and rob and nancy and max and bunch of other people
played assassin.  it was great fun.<br />
<p>
hmm&hellip; what did we do after that??  lunch i guess.  sandwiches with cool
bread and stuff.<br />
<p>
later we danced in the sanctuary and tried to play seasame street but we
just couldn&rsquo;t do it without nathan.
<p>
then massage workshop started in there (ew..yucky) so i slept in a big
puppy pile on jeremy&rsquo;s stomach who was on susanne who was on aaron who
melissa was on and tiffany and fricke were in there somewhere too,
probably some other people too, who knows?  yac meeting started so it was
just me and tiffany and susanne left to sleep in one sleeping bag
(um-against the rules)
<p>
saturday night we had dinner.  it was in little rock tradition with it&rsquo;s
courses and being served and all.  sheri-ann was there and she served us
macaroni.  yay.<br />
<p>
i spent a lot of saturday night (and the rally on a whole) hanging out
with tiffany.  that was awesome &lsquo;cause we really bonded.  we talked about
lots of stuff and just got to know each other better; it was great.<br />
<p>
me and nancy and chris anderson and tia had fun yelling things into
chris&rsquo;s fine ass laptop which he brought along to do a paper and
recording them.  (that sentence was a mastery of grammar).  then austin
and tiffany came over and told us weird stories about working for erick
and stuff.<br />
<p>
stayed up &lsquo;til 3:30 with tiffany and then we decided to sleep but chris
was using my sleeping bag as a pillow so i didn&rsquo;t want to wake him up so
i ganked somebody else&rsquo;s sleeping bag and went to sleep.  then i was
awakened by the owner of this sleeping bag standing over my head.  so i
relinquished this sleeping bag and gently picked chris&rsquo;s head up and took
my sleeping bag and replacing chris&rsquo;s pillow with someone else&rsquo;s sleeping
bag.  hey&ndash;your stuff, my stuff doesn&rsquo;t matter-it&rsquo;s rally love.
<p>
then we had to wake up yucky.
<p>
and we ate bagels and had closing circle and rob is all &ldquo;we&rsquo;re staying
for the service&rdquo;  kick ass. so i got to hang out so much longer with
tiffany and susanne and melissa and nancy and max and jeremy and aaron
and meghan.  but sadly jeremy had to go (not without getting a big hicky
from aaron first) and then max and nancy had to go.  so me and tiffany
and susanne and meghan hung out some more.  we started discussing
tattoos.  they made me pull down my pants and show them mine again. <br>
crazy monkeys.
<p>
then we stayed for the service which was wonderful and the greatest thing
about it was,  marc is giving his sermon, dressed all nice and yet there
is a little piece of glitter on his face.  :-)
then the last hymn was about dancing so everyone started dancing and
gavin and his incredibly cute self was dancing with a woman from the
little rock congregation.<br />
<p>
we started to leave but okc kept trying to kidnap me.  but then we went
20 miles out of our way to eat at subway with okc.  that was great.<br />
<p>
then we started on our loooooong drive home and created a &ldquo;read all the
signs on the road&rdquo; game.  rob played with us for a good while until he
started swerving for paying too much attention to the road sign and not
enough to the actual road.  then we added the word &ldquo;bitch&rdquo; or &ldquo;bitch
mother fucking bitch&rdquo; to the ends of signs we saw too much.  so this is
what it sounded like for an hour:  &ldquo;dot dot dot dot dot dot Willis 45
Exit 101 Mile 101 South Interstate 45 bitch mother fucking bitch dot dot
dot dot dot exit 102 move your ass 16 feet 12 inches bitch watch for ice
on bridge bitch mother fucking bitch.&rdquo;  very funny and actually quite
entertaining.
<p>
finally we got back to rob&rsquo;s apartment and all sat around being grumpy
and tired.  and then i still had to ride all the way back to beaumont
with my dad.  so i didn&rsquo;t get in my bed &lsquo;till 1:30 and then school the
next day!  aaa!! soooooo worth it though!
<p>
i love you all!<br>
cathy<br></p>

                        <p class=date>Wednesday 3 December 1997</p>

<p><p>
For our Wednesday Night LRY dinner outing, we collected at Chuck E. Cheese&rsquo;s Magical (Satanical) Pizza Place.
<p>
KT and I decided it was satanical because their phone number starts with 666.  We decided it was magical because their phone message says so!  (Those reading who don&rsquo;t know me or us: don&rsquo;t take it seriously.)
<p>
Jon W and Sean C were already there when Wende and I arrived.  We ordered a large cheese pizza and got tasty beverages and 120 tokens (actually 126 came out.  hee!) Before we had paid, KT H and Dennis and Adam W arrived.
<p>
Anyways, we all ate and watched the robot-ish animated characters and then played video games and ski-ball and stuff.  Sean and I played a two-player dinosaur shooting game and the seat shook around to mimic what we saw on the screen.
<p>
We played much ski-ball and Adam won the jackpot of 182 tickets by getting 350 points.
<p>
But there were two coolest things about the night:
<p>
<ul>
<li>While I played a ball shooting game, a baby and his mother were sitting by me.  I suddenly remembered what Linda L recently told me after I wrote my thing on
<a href=../../gravity/gravity06.html>ESP</a>. <font size=-1>(side note: as I tried to type &ldquo;gravity07.html&rdquo; I mis-typed &ldquo;gravity06&rdquo;  Turns out gravity06 was correct&hellip;)</font>
<p>
Linda wrote:<br>
<blockquote>
Children before they have a firm grasp of the english( or for that matter
any) language must depend on nonverbal communication. By the age of 2 they
are masters of reading body language and facial expressions. Unfortunatly,
when they begin to learn how to vocalize their needs they forget the lines
of communication they were born with.
Try this: Make eye contact with a small child in a public place. Try to read
what they are sending to you. Watch how the mother and child are
communicating. If the mother is connected with the child&rsquo;s needs the kid
will be generally happy. If she is ignoring the kid (or wants to exert her
will over the childs) the kid will show it usually by crying or worse. Most
times there is a great amount of fustration involved if the mother doesn&rsquo;t
make an effort to be observant to the childs non-verbal signals.
</blockquote>
<p>
I smiled gently toward the baby and opened my mind to him.  He immediately smiled at me and began to verbally speak something like, &ldquo;bahb ahb&rdquo; (I of course wanted to hear &ldquo;Rob&rdquo;).  I looked into his eyes for a while, asking &ldquo;what are you thinking?  what is in your mind?&rdquo;  <br>
I didn&rsquo;t recognize any blatant communication, but I was quite pleased that he looked up at me for a bit.<p></li>
<li>I and kT and Dennis and Jon all climbed up into the tunnels and bright plastic ball pits and had a marvelous time.  I have never (that I remember) gotten to play in a ball pit before!  We buried ourselves, splashed the balls around, threw the balls around and generally had a ball.
<p>
At one point I lost my pager in them all, and we splashed around for a bit looking for it. Wende paged it, but I found it without consciously hearing it beep.  I really enjoyed thrashing around in there.
</li>

                        <p class=date>12 December 1997</p>

<p><p>
Today I looked at a used Toyota Camry for purchase.  After talking to
the guy, my gut reaction said, &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; although the two front CV joints
needed replacing.  He said he&rsquo;d do it for me and keep the price under
$5000 including TT&amp;L.
<p>
Fine.  As I walked back to my car to get my planner, I flipped a coin,
thinking &ldquo;heads means I buy it, tails means I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;  It was tails.
<p>
But my gut still said yes, so I wrote him a $100 check to hold it for
me until tomorrow AM.
<p>
I got home and consulted Wende&rsquo;s Tarot deck and my Runes.
<p>
I don&rsquo;t know much about Tarot, so I shuffled the cards and chose four cards, giving a meaning to each one.
&ldquo;This describes his conscious&rdquo;  &ldquo;This describes his honesty&rdquo;  &ldquo;This describes the car&rdquo;  &ldquo;This tells whether I buy it or not&rdquo;
<p>
The cards came up Six of Rods, Nine of Pentacles reversed, VI The Lovers reversed, and Page of Rods reversed.
<p>
His conscious:  &ldquo;Conquest.  Triumph. Good News. Gain. Advancement.  Expectation.  Desires realized as a result of efforts.&rdquo;
<br>
His honesty: &ldquo;Threat to safety.  Roguery. Danger. Storms. Bad Faith. Possible loss of valued friendship or treasured possessions.&rdquo;
<br>
The car: &ldquo;Failure to meet the test. Unreliability. Separation.  Frustration in love &amp; marriage. Interference by others. Fickleness. Untrustworthiness. Unwise plans.&rdquo;
<br>
Do I buy it: &ldquo;Indecision in proceeding.  Reluctance. Instability. Inability to make decisions. A gossip. Bearer of bad tidings. A person who may break your heart. Displeasure.&rdquo;
<p>
That seems pretty clearly to me that I shouldn&rsquo;t buy it.  But I still wanted to check my runes:
<p>
For the overview of the situation I chose <em>Kano Reversed</em>:<br>
Expect a darkening of the light in some situation or relationship.<br>
It calls for developing inner stability, and carries the warning not to be seduced by the momentum of old ways while waiting for the new to become illuminated in their proper time.
<p>
For the challenge at hand I chose <em>Othila Reversed</em>:<br>
This is not a time to be bound by old conditioning, old authority.<br>
Adaptability and skillful means are the methods to cultivate at this time.  And still you must wait for the universe to act. <em>We do without doing and everything gets done.</em>
<p>
For the timely action I chose <em>Berkana</em>:<br>
Bekana is concerned with the flow of beings into their new forms.  Its action is gentle, penetrating and pervasive.
<p>
Well <em>that</em> seemed clear enough.  But I wanted to choose one more.  Just one more rune to get an overview of the situation.<br>
I almost just reached into the bag and grabbed another.  My intuition said, &ldquo;put the other three back in the bag.&rdquo;  So I put the three back in the bag and mixed them all up.<br />
<p>
I intended, &ldquo;the Rune I choose is an overview of the situation.  Upright means maybe still get the car, Reversed means no way.&rdquo;
<p>
I selected <em>Berkana Reversed</em>:<br>
You may be required to cultivate the soil once again, yet through correct preparation, growth is assured.
<p>
Wow.  Such incredibly specific answers from Runes and Tarot!!!!!

                        <p class=date>Friday 28 November 1997</p>

<p><p>
My brother Fred and I went to see U2 in concert this night.  I had won tickets on KRBE several days earlier, and after much deliberation with myself and Wende, decided to invite Fred.
Fred lives in Las Cruces, New Mexico, but he happened to be in Denton, Texas for the Thanksgiving holidays.  It was only a 5 hour drive from there, but he borrowed Tamara&rsquo;s car and drove down for the concert.
<p>
As soon as he got to the apartment, we left for the show.  We certainly didn&rsquo;t want to be late, and wanted to scope out the place to see if we could rush the stage.  In our haste, we forgot  cash to pay for parking (I did remember the tickets) so we got to the gate, and were all, &ldquo;do you take anything besides cash?&rdquo;
<p>
The dude goes, &ldquo;nope cashownly.&rdquo;
<p>
&ldquo;Okay, we don&rsquo;t have it. What should we do?&rdquo;
<p>
&ldquo;You can turn round and go out that last boof on the lef.&rdquo;
<p>
His pronounciation was fun.
<p>
We turned around and out the booth on the left (which was on the right after we turned around) and got cash and Fred fueled up the truck while we were at the gas station.
<p>
I got fifty bucks and we spent $4 to get back in (we went to the same guy) and $25 to get a T-shirt for me.  That left $21 and Fred couldn&rsquo;t get a shirt until he found a place that accepted credit cards.
<p>
(more to come)
