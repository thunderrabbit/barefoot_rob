<p>Ç±Ç± checked my sentences; - very few grammar errors, but one big vocab
error.   I said "legs are on the table" instead of "legs are under the
table."  Hahahhhahahaa</p>

<p>Oh and she pointed out a spelling error I had been making.  I live
in Ç±Ç§ÇŸÇ≠.  Not Ç±ÇŸÇ≠.</p>

<p>I jokingly said, "are you sure?"  She laughed.  "Yes; I live
here."</p>

<p>Told her about my quotes of the day.  Her quote of the day is
probably "Ç†ÇµÇÕÇ¬Ç≠Ç¶ÇÃÇ§Ç¶Ç≈Ç∑ÅB"</p>

<p>While talking to Koko today, she mentioned that one can purchase
Morpheus glasses for 5000 yen at her theater.  Then she mentioned that
one can buy Morpheus, Trinity, Neo, or Twins glasses.</p>

<p>Twins??</p>

<p>Ack!  Say no more!!!!!</p>

<p>But it was too late.  I haven't seen the movie, but now I have
heard there may be twins in the movie.  D'oh!!!  Oh well.  It's cool.
I hope the twins' existance is not a surprising plot revelation at the
end of the movie.  Sigh.  'sall good.</p>

<p class=date>10:49pm</p>

<p>Okay.  I've seen the movie.   Wow.   My favorite scene was the two
trucks colliding.  Not very likely for a body to survive such an
experience, or for the trucks to perfectly crumple like that, but it
was definitely an amazing crash.</p>

<p>Neo fighting all those Agent Smiths in the city park area was
funny.  'specially when he whirled around on his staff and kicked them
all in series.</p>

<p>I love the gathering of energy when he does his superman thing.
That warping of the matrix is fly.</p>

<p>The creator?  Who was he?  Colonel Sanders?  I forget his title in
the movie.  His soliloquy epitomized the ... unnecessary wordiness of
the movie.  Starting with the oracle, oh - barely starting with
Morpheus addressing the crowd.  (*I* should have been in on that
barefoot wild dancing party!)  Then someone else, oh that French cat.
And I totally noticed that his pretty wallflower wasn't saying
anything, so it highly pleased me when she took on her own persona.
That fighting scene with all the tridents, knives, stakes, etc was
wild, but a little over the top - just too much.  Classy that Neo
didn't pin her to the wall through her arm, but only around the
wrist.</p>

<p>What was the line in the elevator?  When Neo and Trinity are about
to get it on in the elevator and he goes "are you thinking what I'm
thinking?"  and she's like, "yeah, if you're thinking this elevator is
too slow.."  ???  What?  More like too fast cause they didn't have
time to do it.  Why would she have wanted it to be faster?</p>

<p>The car chase scene crushed all other car chase scenes.   But yeah
right their car would still drive through all that and they weren't
reduced to bloody carcasses while driving.  That white ghost twin shot
the fuck outta their car.  And the agents, too.</p>

<p>But it was a cool scene.   I *LOVED* when Trinity drove backwards
through the traffic, and the camera zooming under the cars after her
was sweet.   Did you notice the same right hand exit being used a
couple times?  Musta been only one.   I *heard* they actually built
that highway for the movie.  *that* is amazing.</p>

<p class=date>12:42pm JST Thursday 12 June 2003</p>

<p>There are times when I just want to
(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) and I can't.  I don't have a
word for this thing I cannot do, but (!), I just realized that this
action is perfectly depicted in The Matrix.  "He's doing that superman
thing."</p>

<p>*I* want to do that Neo thing, where he crouches down, flexes his
mind and <em>warps</em> the universe then *EXPLODES* into flight.
*THAT* is fucking cool.</p>

<p>I'm going to call this action neo.  Or maybe doing a neo.</p>

<p class=date>12:10pm JST Friday 13 June 2003</p>

<p>Who who was that guy trying to kill Neo?  That cat who cut his own
hand and then tried to be all, "oh yeah, um, catch you later," when he
almost got caught.  I don't remember seeing him before or after that.
But I tend to unnotice brief male characters.</p>

<p>And at the very end, who was that other cat (in perfect comic book
fashion) presented upside down next to Neo?  An evil Neo twin?   Were
they twin-ish?  Very interesting.</p>

<p>My butt was getting sore by that point in the movie, so I'm glad it
ended, but now I'm like "Hh hh hh hh hh!"</p>

<br>i&rsquo;ve only seen the movie once but, i think the bad guy  was sucked into the phone at the beginning of the movie after he was cloned into an agent. so he is an infiltrator.  then at the end- he is the guy on the table next to neo<br>
  i want to see it again- on the big screen.  maybe tonite.<br>
 <br>
colonel sanders! EXACTLY! hahaha you are so funny</p>

<br>mom,<br>
the car overheated tonight as i waited in line at taco cabanna.  my other mom has been gone for a bit so we didnt have food at home.  i then had to call my cousin and temp. fix it; drive to his house; figure out that my fan doesnt turn!  and that is kind of important!<br>
<br>
so, send me some money to pay for it ohhhh mother dear.<br>
<br>
(that what i kinda said when i called my other mom :)  )<br>
<br>
so dear rob, i think you need to slow down, read your book, eat something real like apples and bannanas , and i feel that you should take a walk somewhere by water.<br>
<br>
thats my perscription based on what i have read in your journals.  i love reading but i dislike when i have missed days so i have to read in reverse.  then, i know what you talk about doing on the previous entry before i even read it.<br>
<br>
i have had a job offer.  to be an accounting manager at the cinemark off of hwy 290.  i talked to the GM, her and i are close.  she was a manager at my theater in the woodlands.  she said i could work fri, sat, sunday and one weekday night.  she really wants me bec. she knows my work ethics.  she knows my abilities and she trusts me. i mean, she gave me all the codes/passwords when i worked at her theater on saturday.    she says i can get 8.75, maybe a few cents more.  i think its a good idea, and that i would be a step towards what i kinda want to do later in life.  i am however, currently enrolled for 18 hours of courses at u of h.  only mon thru thursday  10am till 230.  I THINK I COULD MANAGE, AND I HOPE I WILL TRY.  but, i am doubtfull.  i dont want to let the GM down.  I dont want to take the job then have school start and findout that i cant manage my time well,<br>
in addition to this, i would quite possibly then be able to afford to live downtown, between the theater and school.  this would alow me more study time, do to less drive time.  and more sleep due to less drive time from work.<br>
<br>
to me, right now tonight it seems like a super idea.  but, i am me.  i doubt a whole lot about myself.<br>
<br>
in addition to this, i doubt i would be able to have a week off for swuusi if i started in july.  i suppose i could always talk to her about it up front because it is very important to me.<br>
<br>
wow, this was really long mother rob.<br>
<br>
hope you have a super great, wonderfull day!<br>
<br>
love always,<br>
tinap<br>
<br>
BIG HUG FOR YOU TOO!!!!!!</p>

<p>Å”Å› is so great!  She said my journal is ÇΩÇÃÇµÅ› for her.  I
didn't know what that meant, but beamed when we translated it.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Å”Å› seems to be quite a good student.  She may inspire me to begin
studying Japanese more effectively.  And she says she uses my journal
as a study resource!  I assured her some of the language on my site is
not polite, but I'm honored/happy to have some multi-lingual
readers!</p>

<p>Mailed Milo to Bryn.</p>

<p class=date>5:17pm</p>

<p>Chilled at Kimberly's with Olivia and Grace.</p>

<p>Barely on time to see Fumi in Shibuya.</p>

<p>Didn't call her as I said I would to tell her the price of the
book.  Might give it to her.   Train now.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Aight.  So today has been pretty weekendy.  Japanese class was cool
this morning.  Kimberly was way distracted because Landen was crying
like crazy in the next room.  I was sorta distracted as well, knowing
that she was distracted, but I can't exactly explain why.</p>

<p>All four of us separated after class; Olivia got oranges; Grace did
whatever she does; I remembered that I was going to send a bag of Milo
to Bryn in London.</p>

<p>I'm glad to have completed that item on my to-do list.</p>

                        <p class=date>6:31am JST Monday 9 June 2003</p>

<p>I've discovered two new places in Japan.  One is a grove of trees
just up a surprising hill near Tsunashima station.  At 4:30am I set
out.  Up the hill then down another side I found myself near the ARROW
8 pachinko parlor on the main drag crossing my train line at
Tsunashima station.  Back up the hill and wound my way through the
narrow sidewalks between the houses which cap the hill.  The homes
appear expensive, with more traditional Japanese architecture, sturdy
modern fencing and cameras monitoring the gates.</p>

<p>Trekked carefully into the grove of trees.  A gate type thing
seemed to dissuade bicycles, so I parked near a phone booth at the
entrance.  Ascended the steep incline into the forest in a thankful
peaceful meditative state.</p>

<p>Found a tall roof over some benches.  Sad to see litter littering
the ground all around it.</p>

<p>Don't these people know that Japan is very meticulous?</p>

<p>Guess not.</p>

<p>Down the hill and found a pool that has been closed since November.
It doesn't plan to greet visitors anytime soon, I imagine.  The water
is mucky brown, weeds emerge through the sidewalk.  I can't read the
sign to confirm.  (But I can read the month and date)</p>

<p>Joyful shouting voices erupted every couple minutes, either playing
a game or some barbaric drunken party.  I followed the path toward
them and discovered a soccer game underway.  I didn't approach them; I
can come up with at least ten excuses to cover my fear of the
unknown.</p>

<p>If they had been playing disc I almost certainly would have
joined.  Maybe I'll bring a disc to the field sometime.</p>

<p>Headed back.  Found the public restroom doesn't concern itself with
a doglegged entrance to hide the inside.  There were doors on the
squat-over-a-hole (*) style stalls, but the urinals were in plain
view.</p>

<p>Public restroom location noted.  These can be handy in potty
emergencies. (animaniacs)</p>

<p>(*) To be clear, this hole is not just a hole in the ground, but a
stainless steel sink like thing.  On the ground.  Squat to pee slash
poo slash wipe then step on the handle to flush.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Grabbed food at Lawson's, pooed in our apartment's western style
facilities (while reading about the "Great Wall of China" which turns
out to be a network of walls built over many dynasties, and not like
one huge seam across the country), then rode along the river to
Yokohama.</p>

<p>Now I'm at the second place I discovered today.  A white bridge
structurally like the arches over southwest freeway, but shaped like a
triangle, spans the small bayou next to me.  (I wonder what this size
of waterway is called here).  Oh hey a cat is snoopin' around along
the side.  And I do mean feline.  White legs and stomach and
gray/black spotted back.  S/he seems to have found a little meal in
the grass there.</p>

<p>I finished chowing (if one can chow tofu) and I'll ride somewhere
now.</p>

<p>I've been going downwind, so my trek back will be longer (and
colder (today is overcast and maybe 68 degrees)) so I may just go back
home and snuggle up in bed.</p>

<p>Earlier (before 2am) dream</p>

<p class=dream>The entire world had been clearcut except for the land
next to my dad's house.  I hugged my dad, thanking him for his
stability and for keeping that land.  During the hug he began to hug
someone else as well, and at first I felt jealous, and then I realized
he was bringing other people in to hug _me_.  I felt quite thankful
and quite loved.</p>

<p>Yay Janette for decoding the dream from a week ago!</p>

<p>I've fixed the typos of what she sent me, as I do for all my
dreams.</p>

<p class=lucid>So I held onto Spot and we were moving along a trail
and some other people were having a picnic on the side. They were also
eco tourists and I was new to the group, but my group and their group
knew one another, though they were in different parts of the
group... Our group liked the sun and their group liked something else,
or was it the other way around? and someone in our group yelled
mock-taunting over to them, hey you don't like the sun!  or something
equally silly, and a woman yelled back yeah, well you've got no pants
on! with the implication that we don't like the sun, or we wouldn't
cover up, and we were all oooooh she burned you. and Eric was like,
well, actually she didn't burn him because she also has no pants and I
was like, dude, but did you see who it was-who burned him? She never
does that kinda thing.</p>

<p>Studied with Olivia some Japanese tonight.  Met her roommate Amy
and I already knew her roommate Jen.  They belched plenty in front of
me; it was great.</p>

<p>Work was great at first.</p>

<pre>
lesson 1: man to man (no show)
lesson 2: man to man (no show)
lesson 3: man to man (level 4, she talked the whole time)
lesson 4: voice room (no show)
lesson 5: man to man (level 6.  I've had this guy for the last three
                      days but I still don't remember his name.  He
                      was in the class where we played 2 Truths And A
                      Lie (2 days ago) and yesterday when we played 10
                      Fingers.)

lunch

<p>And then my last three lessons were packed, but they went pretty
well; I had planned them during my free lessons.</p>

<p>The quote of the day:</p>

<pre>
A snake is longer than a monkey.
</pre>

<p>Awesome.</p>

<p>Oh!  And a woman loaned me a picture book on Japanese culture, just
naming (in Romaji) tons of stuff to be found in and around Tokyo.
Foods, shrines, other things and more stuff.  Wow; what a
blessing!</p>
