<p>Jack woke me up at 10:20pm.</p>

<p>Earlier today Jack had asked if I can take him to <em>Harry Potter
and The Chamber of Secrets</em>, and I was all, "can I go with?" so
we're going to meet Josephine at the theater in a bit.  He purchased a
ticket for me online was I was sleepin'.</p>

<p class=date>3:20am CST Friday 15 November 2002</p>

<p>Just got home.  Pretty good movie.  There was one line that I
enjoyed, but seem to have forgotten.</p>

<p>Before the movie, we found Tara and found Josephine after a while.
Josephine saw the movie on the other screen they had set up.  Lots of
peeps wearing striped scarves and silly hats.  One cat even had his
face all marked up to be like a beard.</p>

<p>Before the movie, I snuck in to watch part of <em>8 Mile</em>.  Saw
the part where he goes to WJLB and the part that made Lilly scream and
bang on the windows.  Later I saw the first battle where he's called
The Beaver, and then where Rabbit starts his retort, "Ward, I think
you were a little hard on The Beaver..."</p>

<p>I came back into HP totally hyped.  Turns out I had time to watch
the next battle, but didn't.  Ah well.  I'll see it again.</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>I'm tired.  On break now at work.  It's not like I've done that
much, but maybe I have.  Today began with loading some stuff into
Johnny's truck and then cutting the 105 foot length of the skrim.  In
this case the tolerance was 2 mm, lots easier then 1 mm last night.  I
think I got the cut perect all the way down the length.  Took a bit
over an hour.</p>

<p>Cut some wood and then ripped a 1/4 inch plywood sheet into 2 3/4
inches strips.  Then cut all those mugs down to 7 inches.  Then sanded
smooth one side of each piece.  I found a pretty speedy method of
sanding.  It seems faster than the way I've seen other people sand
them.  I think the end result is just as good.</p>

<p>Been helping Charles glue fabric to large wooden frames 20 x 4 feet
or so.  Like big canvases for painting.  <em>Exactly</em> like big
canvases for painting.</p>

<p>During lunch I went home and saw Jack, but Josephine and the
kittens didn't show up for lunch.  Jack and I both thought today is
their lunch at home day.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is my not at work day; I'm going to San Antonio for CYA
meeting as part of youth advisor training.</p>

<p>Okay.  I found a perl script that writes to sendmail..  Basically
pipes to sendmail as a file.  Awesome.  Now the comments are emailed
to me.  I just gotta tweak their format.</p>

<p>At work today I have cleaned out a couple cubic feet of sawdust
from behind a saw, and moved some big display things to the dumpster.
And re-archived some big backdrops and some old drawings.</p>

<p>Relatively fun way to make some $$</p>

<p class=date>8:02pm</p>

<p>I'm back at work, waiting outside because it's locked up.  Near the
end of the normal work day, Diane said that Johnny asked if I can help
lay some skrim.  Ann just drove up.</p>

<p class=date>10:36pm</p>

<p>Done now.  We layed out a huge scrim (interesting that I spelled it
differently this time) about 30 by 104 feet.  I just spent the last 40
minutes meticulously cutting the 30 foot height exactly (*) along the
weave.</p>

<p>(*) maybe not perfect, but I'd bet it's within 3 threads of where I
started.</p>

<p>Going home now.</p>

<p class=date>11:16pm</p>

<p>Oh my gosh; I forgot an interesting part of work tonight.  Soon
after Ann and I got inside, we heard gunshots outside.  Apparently,
this is a common occurence as the warehouse is on the edge of a
thug/drug ville of Dallas.</p>

<p>We called the cops and they came over and it turns out the liquor
store had been robbed around the same time we heard the gunshots.</p>

<p>Very exciting.</p>

<p>From Meg's livejournal:</p>

<pre>
when i eat, the tastes have to be balanced
im eating pie, i need a pickle
im eating a pickle, i need ice cream
im eating cereal, i need a pickle
eating a muffin, i need peanutbutter
or some kind of drink that balances the sweet to salty ratio
that kind of thing.

im eating the raisins
the peanuts are there to supervise the sweet content of the raisins
better not go over board
so i eat a peanut
then a raisin
peanut
raisin
sometimes both at once
Balance.

<p>My favorite part is that within all this text, only the final word
is capitalized.</p>

<p>Last night I read a chapter of <em>Stranger In A Strange Land</em>
to Janette.  We haven't read the book since she renewed it at the
library around Halloween.  Due to our schedules, we won't be able to
read more before Sunday night.</p>

<p>Chez and Jackie each came to visit us tonight.  Mostly just chatted
and tormented Josephine a bit playing the game where she had to figure
out what dream one of us had.</p>

<p>Lots of funny stuff but I'm too tired to remember any, much less
write it.</p>

<p>Super thanks to Wende for having the ultra foresight to create
ROB'S RESCUE KIT, consisting of first aid supplies and such.  She's
the best.</p>

<p>At work, while my higher self was saying, <em>get some gloves
on</em>, I cut my finger slightly, but effectively enough to get blood
splots on the front of my shirt.  Eight splots.</p>

<p class=date>7:17pm</p>

<p>Just got done with work, the last hour of which consisted of taking
Ivory home; he was pretty much sick all day today, despite eating four
hamburgers at Wendy's.</p>

<p class=dream>Headlines on TV that we had just engaged in military
battle with Iraq, watching a plane fly in and launch a missle, and
watching the missle as it rocketed across the landscape and finally
detonated near a lot of people and then I was with all the guys from
the Wolf Shop, up on a platform with the bad guys all around us.</p>

<p class=dream>Joe was down below, throwing lines of staples up to us
so that we could use them to fight in hand to hand combat, or put them
on the bottom of our shoes and kick.  Then all the bad guys were
walking away and some other crew of women was walking in to help us
fight.  We came down the stairs because our shift was being relieved
and one of the women took our picture to verify that we were okay.
Her left breast had been naked, so she covered it up with her hand
when she took the picture so as to not distract us.</p>

<p class=dream>She gave me the picture (taken with a polaroid) and
though I had specifically not looked at her breast when the picture
was taken, I was looking down in the picture.  Our faces were all
covered in shoe polish as camoflauge.</p>
