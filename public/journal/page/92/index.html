<ol>
<li>Ma is in town!</li>
<li>We are going to Nagano today</li>
<li><del>Still don&rsquo;t feel completely resolved regarding Renee and Gunma</del></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="20-43-saturday-19-august-2017-jst">20:43 Saturday 19 August 2017 JST</h2>

<ol>
<li>Lin, Ma, and I just got home from Nagano</li>
<li>it&rsquo;s raining harder than it does during the misnamed/mistimed &ldquo;rainy
season&rdquo; of the past couple of years.</li>
<li>I recently created <a href="https://tokyo.mypowercircle.org/">https://tokyo.mypowercircle.org/</a> to be the MKP website for Tokyo / Japan.</li>
<li>Takeshi has talked about starting a Japanese-language men&rsquo;s group (on Saturdays)</li>
<li>I need to sort out different languages for the site (currently compiled by Hugo)</li>
<li>mypowercircle.org is currently only in English.  I do not know what Japanese content I can add while testing, but I think Takeshi will be the first to write Japanese for the site.</li>
<li>I will email him now.</li>
<li>Have recently re-started messing with XCode and trying to get our apps to work in latest iOS <del>garbage</del> version</li>
<li>Hugo keeps saying too many open files and the solutions here don&rsquo;t help <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/168">https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/168</a></li>
<li>Yay I got it working with <code>hugo server --watch=false</code></li>
<li>We have one cat (Jennie) and no other animals nor kids</li>
<li>We have lots of plants though. I basically just have Alex and his progeny</li>
<li>One of Alex&rsquo;s leaves seems to be taking root near the corner of the park at the top of the steps</li>
<li>The new Odakyu Line in Noborito had rails but recently <em>removed them again!!</em></li>
<li>We talk to Ma about once a week</li>
<li>We talk to dad less frequently; he always seems to be busy</li>
<li>We may go see Lin&rsquo;s dad this year</li>
<li>I have the AB hard drive to try to get old data off the drive</li>
<li>I am sure the data does not exist, but gosh if it does that would be great</li>
<li>At this point, Marble Track 3 movie is in two parts, totaling like 1 minute 50 seconds <a href="https://new.robnugen.com/journal/2017/08/16/mt3-playlist-mt3-movie-so-far/">https://new.robnugen.com/journal/2017/08/16/mt3-playlist-mt3-movie-so-far/</a></li>
<li>The playlist in the link above may get more / longer videos.</li>
<li><a href="https://mt3.robnugen.com">https://mt3.robnugen.com</a> should show the latest video or news</li>
<li>I plan to work on MT3 a bit tomorrow.</li>
<li>Ma is leaving on Tuesday.  It has been such a quick visit!</li>
<li>I just emailed Takeshi and note that I am 25 messages behind inbox 0 (not counting 173 starred messages</li>
<li>bah</li>
<li>About to try first attempt at Japanese on mypowercircle site via <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/">https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/</a></li>

<p>The aquarium in Shinagawa is more of a madhouse on holidays.  It has
really been modernized with touch screens, a rocking boat
(amusement park ride which does not go very high, but features at
least as shrill screams as any scream machine), some fireworks themed
lights, and that&rsquo;s before we get to see any real fish!</p>

<p>The most interesting thing for me is the plexiglass arch which forms a
tunnel under which we can walk and over which fish (mostly manta rays)
can swim.  It was nearly as if we were in the water.  I wondered how
easy it would be to make a glass tube so we&rsquo;d be able to see fish
below us as well.  Seems like it might be a pain to keep clean,
though, with people walking on it, etc.</p>

<p>Ma&rsquo;s said her most interesting thing was seeing the turtle and
tortoise (in different exhibits).  She likes turtles.</p>

<p>Lin&rsquo;s favorite things were the dolphins, and penguins.</p>

<p>Ma also liked the penguins.</p>

<p>I would have liked the otters best if they had not been sleeping.  Maybe I
oughta come at a different time of the day to see their antics.</p>

<p>Right now we are chillin in Shinagawa Prince hotel about to go to a
dinner featuring Lin, Lin&rsquo;s ママ, my Ma, and me.</p>

<p>After the workout, Lin and Ma showed me Candy Show Time(?) a shop
where they convert sugar, flavor, and food coloring into long noodles
before cutting the noodles into candy sized pieces.  It&rsquo;s pretty
ingenious, to be honest.</p>

<p>$700 for a custom order.  Hmmmm.  Maybe Dogecoin or another crypto
coin would be a unique design they hadn&rsquo;t done before.</p>

<p>Lin and Ma joined me on the way to SOGO.  They watched from a bench
across from the tree where SOGO peeps generally meet.  Workout was
great fun, though a bit hard since I haven&rsquo;t attended in a while.
Unfortunately I won&rsquo;t be able to attend for two months starting in
October.  I&rsquo;m bummed about that, but work is work.</p>

<pre><code>FEEDBACK from Co-coordinator no. 1 (responsible for finding,
promoting to, communicating with, and bringing 18 people), with
input from several Guests

· VALUE: 13,000¥ would be appropriate if guests had their OWN
    ROOMS (and could have done proposed activities…).  Not
    appropriate for dorm-style sleeping.

· OVERPRICED: also in proportion to services provided.  What made
    price acceptable to the group were the activities we provided
    ourselves (own van from and back toTokyo &amp; around Gunma,
    professional yoga, games, meditation, music…)

· BABY-SITTING SHOULD NOT BE GUESTS’ RESPONSIBILITY: When asked to
    give the guest a break from their child, it should be heeded.
    (It was ignored.)

· GUESTS SHOULD NOT BE CONSCRIPTED TO COOK, CLEAN, or SERVE,
    (especially when paying 13,000¥ for the weekend).

· NOT KEEPING TO THE SCHEDULE: Dr. Wada’s treatments had been
    scheduled for 2-5 p.m., but without asking co-organizers or
    group, these went on until past midnight. Could not then do
    group afternoon activities proposed (like making Kokeshi /
    daruma…)

· SUNDAY BREAKFAST FINISHED in AFTERNOON, -Host started late, and
   chose to cook waffles, by herself.  Hungry guests jumped in,
   hoping to be fed sooner.  An atmosphere of scarcity and
   confusion about the day’s activities ensued.

· DELAY meant we could not do any of the Lake Haruna activities
    that had been promised/proposed for Sunday.

· GUESTS’ NEEDS NOT MET; Some guests felt shut down and
    disrespected when they had Qs (i.e.. about breakfast, or
    packing up) Particularly noticeable in a highly
    service-oriented country such as Japan.  RESPECT &amp; DIGNITY
    toward guests LACKING.

· PAYMENT DEMANDED BEFORE ACCOUNTING COMPLETE: As 18 people
    getting restless at being 3 HOURS behind schedule. payment
    could have been completed at any other moment, so
    co-organizers could check the bill.  Host adamantly refused.
    Due-diligence very difficult; Felt like EXTORTION.

· OVERCHARGED &amp; NO RECEIPT: Host reneged on her promise of free
    room for co-organizers, but had neglected to inform them.
    Discovered upon return home.  One guest was also charged 2
    nights when she only stayed one.

· HOST HAD WANTED GROUPS and asked for the business.
    Co-organizers had genuinely wanted to help, and worked very
    hard to do so. But even with 18 people, not one person was
    discounted.

· SHUNGITE OR NATURE EXCURSIONS should be promoted.  NOT BOTH.
    Those who came to be out in nature felt short-changed.

Conclusion: co-coordinator no. 1 would NOT recommend this host,
ESPECIALLY not for groups, or foreigners.
[Host’s priority seems to be cash, not guests.]

Even though we thoroughly enjoyed each other’s company, enjoyed
nature when we DID get out, and the activities we DID get to do,
all while respecting their rules, co-coordinator no. 1 felt
disrespected, shut down, unappreciated, and frustrated that she
could not provide her guests what had been promised.

Maybe hosts will improve with experience, and with feedback?  We
genuinely hope so!

Coordinator number 2 thinks the schedule not being maintained
caused problems with the guest experience. For example, not
adequately preparing/planning for breakfast, and creating an
atmosphere of scarcity on Sunday morning. Or confusion with
activities for the day.

Airbnb has been informed of the numerous damages caused to our

<p>Because the review no longer shows up on her profile, I assume they
took it down because she disputed it.  Therefore any damages to her
property&rsquo;s reputation are negligible.</p>

<p>Given that
<a href="/journal/2017/07/01/met-ren%C3%A9e/">I already gave her 20,000 yen</a>,
I choose to call it even.</p>

<pre><code>HI Renee!

I was going to just pay it, but was unable to verify the credit
card information.  As far as I can tell, the review no longer
appears on your profile, so there is no damage to your property's
reputation.

Let's just call it even.
