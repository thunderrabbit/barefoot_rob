<p>A-san-su treated us to dinner after we went to Machida with him and
a-san-su-mei.  Lin wanted to drive, which I didn&rsquo;t mind until we got
close to the station and tried to park.  Man we coulda saved a lot of
time by taking the train.</p>

<p>Anyway, they found no souvenirs in Machida area, but got some near our
station.  The we ate at our favorite buffet restaurant and talked
about eating less, esp at night, and eating better, esp in the
morning.  We shall see.</p>

<p>Great to have a-san-su and a-san-su-mei staying with us for a couple
of days!  I met them around the time Lin and I got married, so it&rsquo;s
been a few years since we&rsquo;ve seen them!  Lin&rsquo;s sisters and kids came
over last night for big dinner and lots of laughter.  Middle sister
and I did cheers a couple times with red wine and limone,
respectively.  I tried to find an ordering around the table that would
have a smooth transition between languages spoken.  Couldn&rsquo;t solve it
even with just 3 languages involved.</p>

<p>The kids played with the French vertical labyrinth kinda game, and did
pretty well.  The youngest was the most willing to play.  Middle kid
just watched TV and the oldest focused on social media via cellphone.
We all focused on brownies and ice cream at the end of the evening.
So decadent!</p>

<p>Sisters and kids left around 10pm and then we pretty much headed to
sleep.</p>

<p>This morning I showed aunt and uncle Marble Track 3 so far (finished
first four clips (5 minutes 28 seconds (~3936 frames)))</p>

<p>Now headed to TY.</p>

<p>Virtual Group was good today.  I got some feedback on how to better
handle a man joining in the middle of the call.  Essentially, he knew
he was late, and he knew why he was late; I did not have to ask him
why he was late, but just if he knew why he was late.</p>

<p>Great I-group today; I had chills from within when I got to yell at my
dad from when I was 7 years old.</p>

<p>He said &ldquo;if there were 100 people from your class all in a line, you
would be the smartest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He meant it well, but it&rsquo;s like hey fuck you don&rsquo;t put that on a 7
year old!  what is he going to do with that info?</p>

<p>just love me and say you&rsquo;re proud of me etc.  so I had a good dad give
me the messages I wanted to hear.  such a great relief</p>

<p>I am at a hospital with Lin after a little fender bender involving a
guy&rsquo;s shoulder hitting her mirror hard enough to cut her hand as the
glass shattered into her open window.</p>

<p>The police officer came and suggested it will be easiest/cheapest
overall if they don&rsquo;t sue each other and just do <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> blame and call
it in to their respective insurance companies.  Otherwise they will
both lose their license etc etc.</p>

<p>Lin&rsquo;s fine, and the guy&rsquo;s apparently fine; goodness gracious I hope
she starts being more careful.</p>

<p>5:30pm meeting is underway, but I am only being asked questions via
text while here at JB since they are doing it in Japanese (at CB).</p>

<h2 id="17-47">17:47</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m dialed in now.</p>

<h2 id="17-51">17:51</h2>

<p>They are asking how the API works.  I explained it is like a web
server which gives just data instead of data and HTML.  They said they
understand that, but how does it <em>work</em>?</p>

<p>I explained I have never touched the code of this particular API.</p>

<p>Listening to this now, I am thankful I don&rsquo;t generally have to sit
through business meetings in Japanese.</p>

<h2 id="18-00">18:00</h2>

<p>I was told that they only had until 6pm, but the meeting is showing no
signs of being finished.</p>

<h2 id="18-07">18:07</h2>

<p>I think Nate is making some good points.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>Basically he is saying what I said: &ldquo;you should have said something
before (months ago).&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="22-45-wednesday-11-october-2017-jst">22:45 Wednesday 11 October 2017 JST</h2>

<p>Okay the end result is that I will meet with them and answer their
questions about the API.</p>

<p>The kids lessons were pretty good today.  The two new students (one in
each of my first two classes) are still not speaking, and I can&rsquo;t tell
if they are acting shy or don&rsquo;t understand..  anytime they speak, they
get the right answer, but getting them to speak is a stretch.  esp
with the other kids being so chatty.  I ain&rsquo;t sure how to handle it.</p>
