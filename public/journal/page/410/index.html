arrived back at the ranch.  Thanks to Hillary, Josepine, Mikey for
getting the smoothie fixin's!</p>

Janette and I) else is at the store called Ole Moon, looking at stuff
including glass blown items, Hillary's current favorite.</p>

<p class=date>3:21am CST Wednesday 1 January 2003</p>

<p>Happy Happy Joy Joy.</p>

<p>Tons of fun; tons of people.</p>

<p>Got to get to know Natalie from Little Cypress (near Orange) better.</p>

<p>Got to help Asha burn a CD.</p>

<p>Got to run back from the lake with Jackie, and get to know her better.</p>

<p>Got to chat with Laura Caddell who came by after the magic hour.
So honored that she said, "it was a very pleasant surprise to see you
here."</p>

<p>Didn't call Wende, Sally, Dude, Veronica around their midnight on
the west side.  Still love them.</p>

<p>Read some of my old journal entries from February 2001.  Amazing.</p>

<p>Got to go to bed now.  So tired.</p>

<p class=date>11:41am CST Wednesday 1 January 2003</p>

<p>About last night:</p>

<p>~) So awesome to have such a tight community, resulting from years of
YRUU events together.  Such awesome random funniness, with everyone
being respectful and friendly and funny and silly, without anyone
having to suggest "rules" for the event.</p>

<p>!) Similar to my style at rallies, I tried to seek out those who
didn't seem really involved in the conversations.  Like Natalie.
After a while, Jack came by, and I was all, "Jack, how do I get her
talking?" and he said, "she'll talk about how much she hates The
Academy," to which Natalie was all, "I don't want to talk about school
during break."  I actually already knew she didn't want to talk about
it; I had tried querying her on it.</p>

<p>@) Lots of chilling and dancing before midnight, but I'm not
remembering specifics.</p>

<p>#) Asha went through my mp3 and chose some to burn on CD.  She was
quite excited to have the CD finished right <em>now!</em></p>

<p>$) After midnight a group of us went to the lake.  Asha was
piggyback on me for a bit cause her foot was cramping or breaking
through blisters. (she ended up breaking through the back of her foot)
At the lake, I was freezing, but stood in Tadasana to relax my blood
into warming through me.</p>

<p>%) Meg & Paul walked over to the mysterious covered pool things by
the lake and I followed them cause I've wanted to know what the pools
were for.  I'm all, "what are these pools for?"  and they were all,
"boats" which was obvious for they were perfectly obviously for boats.
"but over here, there are little wall things blocking the entrance.."
We examined the situation there and could never decide why they had
been blocked.  Someone guessed maybe these boat dock things were
unusable, but then why would both sides be blocked (the lake side and
the land side)?</p>

<p>^) Paul had the great idea or desire to leap across the water,
which was actually a bad idea because the water was freezing and if we
fell in, we'd be soaked for a mile+ walk back to the house in cold
wind situation.  I used the window ledge to step a huge step across
the water, and made it okay to the 10 inch wide section of concrete,
then leaped the four or five feet to the wide section of concrete with
no problem.  On the way back to the small section, using the window as
support, I lost my balance and my toe slid through the water, so I
tossed myself through the window to the land side, walked smiling back
through the door, "<em>almost</em> fell in!"</p>

<p>&) Jackie had asked if I would run back with her, which would help
us stay warm and get out of the cold air more quickly, which I was all
"awesome, but I reserve the right to wuss out before we get there."
We ran about 3/4 mile I'm guessing before we had to stop.  Great
conversation with her, talking about her future plans and intentions
and queries about what she'll really end up doing.  Me offering
anecdotes to prove that basically she can switch later if she chooses,
and that I have a lot of the same questions.</p>

<p>*) Back at the house we discovered Laura Caddell had arrived and I
chatted with her basically until I was falling asleep in the chair
(which wasn't very long).</p>

<p>Colleen, Janette and I went to see 8 Mile today.  It was Colleen's
first viewing, Janette's second, my third.  I loved it loved it loved
it as much as the first time, or maybe more.</p>

<p>Colleen wasn't as blown away as I appeared to be, as I busted out
of the theater, "that movie <em>crushes</em> all other movies!" and
decided once and for all I'm going to write to Eminem and thank him
for all his creativity.</p>

<p>What an incredible blessing to inspire Ken to drive out to Davis
Mountains!  He inquired about the terrain out there and I told him a
bit then showed him pictures I had taken.  He was all, "Ann, look,"
and seemed determined that this trip they must take.  No people, lots
of stars, lots of rocks to climb... totally beautiful.</p>

<p>I was *pumped* to feel like my adventure actually helped someone
else be inspired to travel!  By me taking care of myself, I have
helped the world.  What an amazing feeling.</p>

<p>He blessed my life, the choices I've made.. said I'm "making all
the right choices" and living in reality instead of trying to follow
the non-spiritually-fulfilling American Dream that is so crammed down
our intellects by media and culture.</p>

<p>Thank you, Ken.  Thank you, angels.  Thank you, universe.</p>

<p>So great to have a chance to sit and chat with Colleen.  Wiggidy
wiggidy wack stuff had been going on in her life, but my blessing
intention is that she has gained all the wisdom and insight she is
supposed to have from these experiences and that it's all an uphill
spiral from here.</p>

<p>I've so enjoyed being able to watch her grow for 7 years, (and she
said the same thing about me!) for basically all her adult life (and
mine too, eh?).</p>

<p>I hope hope hope I have helped at least in some small way.</p>

<p>On the way home, we drove by the spillway from White Rock Lake into
a river that goes underneath Garland Road.  That's where Sean and I
bicycled all those months ago and saw it as a tiny trickle of water
over the wall in the middle where the wall is a bit lower.</p>

<p>Today the entire wall had about 6 inches of water gushing over it,
rushing quietly down this slight slope and then crashing loudly over a
couple of rocks and into the river proper, turning one big island into
lots of little islands and then gushing under the foot bridge and road
and away into the night.  I'd like to see it during the day.  Oh, with
my camera too.  I wonder if it will still be as much water pouring
over it in the morning, and if I'll even remember or be willing to go
over there.</p>

<p>During the night I woke up and turned Scott on and ran the heater
for about 10 minutes to warm up, put on my hoodie and went back to
sleep.</p>

<p>This morning I had dreams that included climbing through a haunted
house with YRUUers, and some of my old high school friends, including
Lynda, my first real girlfriend.</p>

<p class=dream>We climbed up through some narrow suspended catwalk
things, twisty and dangling like prepositions.  We'd have to step over
gaps in the air to get to the next catwalk.  Joana Olsen and someone
were in front of me at first, but then they took a wrong turn and Ed
Lerner and I passed them as they worked out a way to get back on
track.</p>

<p>Okay, I'm going to emerge from my sleeping bag coccoon (sp) and
roll out.  The idea of a hot shower with scrub brush at home
overpowered my urge to stay bundled up and try to sleep more to escape
the cold.</p>

<p>5868.7 miles traveled since Dallas.</p>

<p class=date>8:20am</p>

<p>Just passed a rest area 2 miles sign.  I was about 3 miles away
from it.  Not that they have warm bunks and showers, eggs, toast,
jelly and blueberry muffins, but they do have restrooms.</p>

<p>5872.5 miles traveled.</p>

<p>Computer, why don't you whip that thing out and play us a tune?</p>

<p>Turned over 6000 miles during the song "A Warm Place" by Nine Inch
Nails.  Now we're on "The Downward Spiral" from the same album at 6016
miles, climbing up a steep hill.  45 mph in 4th gear.  Maybe so slow
cause I'm typing.  Hmmm.</p>

<p>Oh, Sally, I want to send you the song "Eraser" by NIN. It also has
a wacked out beat that you might find interesting or even
enjoyable....</p>

<p>Bang I'm back in Texas.  Fatboy Slim took us across the border.
Tori Amos live (bootleg?) mp3 of "Precious Things" carries us across
the open plains of the Texas panhandle.  I've never been up here
before.  "The Panhandle" had always been a mystery to me.  What's it
like to be that far north and still be in Texas??</p>

<p>Oh, I am reminded this is the song that Tori Amos totally blew us
all away in concert at Cullen auditorium "with their nine inch nails
and little facist panties tucked inside the heart of every nice
girrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrl" holding the last word as she turned on her
piano seat away from grand piano and mic 180 degrees to harpsichord
and mic and finished out the word and the song.</p>

<p>Woah.</p>

<p>The <em>best</em> part of that was during her rotation, the
audience (as all good Tori audiences) was silent, and we could
<em>hear</em> Tori with no amplification.  Just Tori's pure voice.
Like she was right there in my heart singing only to me for that
moment.</p>

<p>Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm.</p>

<p>Hmmm.  I'm in Amarillo, but I apparently passed Commerce, which I
intended to take to Kinko's so I turned south on 87 to just skip it
altogether.  However, when I checked the map, I needed to take 287 and
not 87, so it's a good thing I checked soon after I exited.</p>

<p>Thanks to Texas' motto "The Friendly State" a guy saw my map, and
hollered (we do that in Texas) "whereya trying to go?"</p>

<p>"Dallas!"  we were about 30 feet apart at our respective gas pumps.</p>

<p>And he confirmed how to get there, estimated the number of miles to
the correct exit, told me how to get off 87 to the loop around DFW,
then to 30 and I'd be there.  How friendly can one cat be?</p>

<p>Then I asked someone else where Commerce is, in case I had not
passed it, but would still see it by going further on 40, and he
pulled out his Amarillo map, found the shortest route from this gas
station to there, which includes a couple block drive
on... Mockingbird.  It's a sign.  Though I gotta backtrack a bit, I'm
goin'; that's all there is to it I'm fuckin' goin'. (*)</p>

<p>Plus my battery is low from playing mp3s.  Gotta get charged.</p>

<p>When I first was chillin' with Colleen in the kitchen, I was all,
"look a raccoon!" and pointed to the kitchen floor.  So funny that she
looked, not that anyone wouldn't have looked, but because she has
several raccoon stories from her semester(s) at school in Corpus
Christi, from raccoons in the stairway to raccoons trying to come
steal her food, to raccoons coming to scrounge through the trash while
she's chillin' outside, to almost running over a raccoon in the
parking lot, to raccoons taking her car for a joyride around the
city.</p>

<p>Oh, wait, not that last one, but still.</p>

<p>"And the raccoons are freakin' huge like they sleep in radiation
fields and get all huge and stuff."</p>
