<p>Ayana is quite a patient teacher.  I'm pretty much going to quit
going to my Tuesday class because I get frustrated in there by the
native Chinese speakers who know kanji and zoom past me, plus the
teacher panders to them more than to me, because I'm totally sucking
ass in that class compared to them.  Blah; whatever.</p>

<p>Oh, plus that teacher (Hoso) knows limited English and doesn't seem
to understand when I need more time to answer, and doesn't hear me
when I answer correctly; she talks all over me and gives the answers;
fuck, it's just really frustrating, and distracts me from studying
just for one Japanese class.</p>

<p>Basically the internet distracts the hell out of me, and keeps me
from studying much at all, and when I'm trying (word-fuck word) to
study for two classes, it messes me up even more.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Today Ayana let me review some adjectives and their conjugations
for present, present-negative, past, and past-negative tenses.  She
said they are tricky for everyone.</p>

<p>Woah</p>

<p>I haven't journaled in days.  Well a day.</p>

<p>I rode my bike to work.</p>

<p>Met a girl (Tomoko) in voice room who loves rollercoasters.  Wonder
if we can go ride sometime.</p>

<p>Got a letter from Steffers (whoohoo), and two notices of packages
from janette!!  Whooooohoooo!</p>

<p class=date>11:57pm JST Thursday 30 October 2003</p>

<p>The girls are being REALLY loud outside tonight.  Really
inappropriate and inconsiderate.  Obviously no YRUU upbringing
here.</p>

<p>Well the good thing: I'm beginning to remember what time the train
will come.  I knew <em>I gotta be at the station before ten oh
oh</em>.</p>

<p>The not as good thing: I didn't make it.  I missed the train by 3
minutes and have to wait 5 minutes for the next one.</p>

<p>Idea: don't cut it so close.</p>

<p><h1>State of My Life</a></p>

<p><ol type="I">
<li><p>Yesterday, on the day I planned to visit Hakkeijima Sea Paradise, it
rained.   Today it&rsquo;s sunny (even warm) (and I&rsquo;m wearing a long sleeved
shirt cause it was cold yesterday).  The two weeks before yesterday it
was sunny (not counting my previous weekend, when it rained).  This
seems to epitomize my experience in Japan lately.</p></p>

<p>Blarg.</p>

<p>How can I complain?  I'm in Japan for goodness sakes.</p>

<p>There's something underneath this.</p>

<p>* I came to Japan to study Japanese.</p>

<p>* Actually I came to Japan so I could learn the culture (language)
well enough to interface between American youth and Japanese host
families.  I can learn Japanese that well, but I'd have to stay here
for a while.</p>

<p>* I don't want to stay here that long away from janette.</p>

<p>* The only way I'd be (wow the *only* way?) happy here is if I had
a girlfriend here.  Someone to hug on every day.</p>

<p>* I don't want to let go of janette to make a girlfriend in Japan
an option.</p>

<p>* BUT, I don't want to leave Japan and not have done cool stuff in
Japan.</p>

<p>* My plan now is to just do some fly things and then leave; get the
flock outta here.</p>

<p>* "some fly things" doesn't help me know when I'm done being
here.</p>

<p>I want to see:</p>

<p>. Niko (sp) (the place with monkeys north of here (scheduled for mid
November with my mom and Jon)</p>

<p>: Yomiuriland</p>

<p>; the haunted house at Fujikyu Highland</p>

<p>= Climb Mount Fuji (a little bit too late (cold) in the year to do
it now)</p>

<p>3 Hawaii</p>

<p>Oops, I ran out of Japan things that I want to see.</p>

<p><p>Dude.  It sounds like I&rsquo;m interested in getting the flock outta
here.</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>Basically I have learned some rudimentary Japanese and learned
how to usually successfully navigate the trains in Tokyo.</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>I seem to drive myself harder than I want to drive myself.  All
in the name of fufilling &ldquo;doing something for the world.&rdquo;</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>to</p></li>
<li><p>be</p></li>
<li><p>continued</p></li>
<li><p></p></li>
<li><p>(not)</p></li></p>

<p>One good thing about going to amusement parks in the rain: fewer crowds.</p>

<p>Hakkeijima Sea Paradise was basically a ghost town.  Including us,
I saw 4 groups of people at the park.</p>

<p>There is one good coaster at HSP.  It's a large mine train coaster,
1/2 of which is set on piers in the bay.  I rode this coaster 7 times
today, and bought the picture five times.  Poses that I bought:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Wazzap!</p></li>

<li><p>zzzzzz</p></li>

<li><p>hmmmmm</p></li>

<li><p></p></li>

<li><p>Eeeee (*)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>These are the poses that I didn't purchase.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>[weird 3/4 view silly face] (this one didn't look as silly as I
hoped)</p></li>

<li><p>[Madonna's Vogue] (this one will look far better with a train
full of screaming people)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>(*) I don't know the name of this pose, but it was suggested to me
as a good idea by the picture booth staff, and supported by Liz.  Liz
said if I show it to any Japanese, I'll steal the show.  I don't
really know what this means besides that.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Liz and I rode Blue Fall 4 times, a pretty tall drop tower.  Aw man
I didn't count the number of seconds of freefall, but I'd guess it
gives four full seconds of freefall time.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>One day I'll get pictures on here.  I hope.</p>

<p>It's fucking raining.</p>

<p>Great clear weather all week while I was at work and it's fucking
raining *again* on my weekend.   This is the third (THIRD!) weekend in
a row that it's rained after having been clear during the week.</p>

<p>What is the lesson?</p>

<p>Studied a tiny bit.  I've got to wean myself off GTA3 and
internet.  I've done well with getting off the internet recently.
Well, weller than before.  Matty is going to sell the TV and
playstation soon.</p>

<p>50,000 yen for big TV and PS2 and games and VCR and Sopranos VHS
tapes (purchased, not recorded from TV).  Huge deal.</p>

<p>I have just yammered with janette for an hour.  I spilled my guts
about Japan as a practice session for talking to Kim.  Not like
nervous, but just getting my thoughts aligned.</p>

<p>Overview: Learning Japanese without a girlfriend here seems
fruitless and difficult. ( "Getting a Japanese girlfriend is the best
way to learn." )  The original reason I'm here is to learn Japanese
enough to liase between American youth and Japanese host families for
2 weeks at a time.  That means I gotta know hella Japanese.</p>

<p>A different reason I could be here is to learn all that I've
learned and to ride / take pictures of rollercoasters here.</p>
