<p>Excellent!  Kinko's has free internet access.  And.....  they are
open 24 hours...  and they are within walking distance of my
apartment!  Whoohoo!</p>

<p class=date>8:58pm</p>

<p>Super nice.  I have just got my finances up to date with my bank
account and credit cards and such.  Yay for free internet!</p>

<p class=date>1:10am CDT Monday 24 June 2002</p>

<p>Aight; I'm going to bed.  Actually Sally called me while I was at
Kinko's and I talked to her for one hour and walked home, drove to
Dude's, stood out in the intersection during that time.  Now I've just
finished going through all my unread emails, and now I'm going
home.</p>

<p>emacs rules.</p>

<p>I have just written a macro that will set up a new journal entry,
including putting todays date for the name of the file, and the date
at the top of the file.  Awesome!</p>

<p>For some reason the command insert-kbd-macro will write " ?"
between each character of the macro.  I removed all occurences of " ?"
and then removed the "[?" at the beginning and "]" at the end, and can
use the resulting string in my .emacs file.</p>

<p class=date>9:00pm</p>

<p>Hmm.  My computer clock is 10 minutes slower than the KTRU clock,
and 15 minutes slower than the other KTRU clock.</p>

<p class=date>9:21pm</p>

<p>Today's shift at KTRU is the kind of shift that makes me go, "ah,
why do I do KTRU anymore?"  No one is really calling; the music
doesn't do anything for me today; I'm just tossing in some CDs and
records, choosing randomly as I usually do.</p>

<p>Tonight after KTRU, I'm going to Dude's to be online and get my
budget caught up.</p>

<p class=date>10:36pm</p>

<p>At Dude's now; we are watching Black Hawk Down on his wide screen TV.</p>

<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<p><ol><li><p>I recently lost my job at FSD.  They couldn&rsquo;t afford me and
knew I was going to leave anyway.  I&rsquo;m super thankful for the freedom,
and a bit fearful and a lot optimistic about my future.</p></p>

<p>The next thing that seems like a good idea to do is to sit down
with my budget and figure out a spending plan.  I will do that today
while I'm still in Austin.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm in Austin celebrating my mom's and brother's birthdays
after having interviewed with Nova to get a job in Japan teaching
English.  I believe I will be accepted; I'll get confirmation in about
2 weeks.</p></li>

<li><p>In a parallel universe, I got married to Wende yesterday, Friday, Summer
Solstice 21 June 2002.  We were married as part of her family's Family
Reunion in Hunt, Texas beside the river at Casa Bonita.</p>

<p>In this universe, I got scared back around October or so and
realized I just couldn't do it, that I had to travel first, to learn a
lot more about myself before committing to marriage.  I am quite happy
overall for my choice.  I feel guilty and embarassed when I think
about being around Wende's family; I can't face them, and I don't
imagine I'll ever make the opportunity to do so.</p>

<p>And interestingly, my shame feelings increase the further away from
Wende I get in her family.  I mean I could basically sit with Wende's
immediate family and explain to them my situation etc or whatever.
But Wende's Aunt Nancy I could *maybe* do that.  Aunt Margot and Uncle
Gary, *maybe*..  Further out to aunts and uncles whose names I don't
really remember?  No.</p>

<p>Why is that?  Seems quite strange that those with whom I have the
least relationship, I'm the least able to face about my choice.  I
imagine it's cause I have no identity with them except as Wende's (ex)
fiance.  Hmmmm.</p></li>

<li><p>I have just recently gotten my new Mac PowerBook G4 Titanium,
and I love it.  So far I have:
<ul><li>learned how to use ssh, scp, sftp to connect securely to my website</li>
<li>Sucessfully scp'd a few journal entries to my site</li>
<li>Set up my .emacs file and used emacs to write journal
entries.</li></ul></p>

<p>I still need to do a few things with it:

<ul><li>Set up email, including GPG (Gnu's PGP) so I can send signed
and/or encrypted emails. (and maybe get off yahoo email altogether)</li>
<li>Figure out how to use the C-q command during a macro to name a
journal entry and set up its guts.</li>
<li>Make sure I'm enrolled with the Apple Care Protection Plan.</li>
<li>Get it insured against theft.</li>
<li>Get a better photo editor than iPhoto; I can't figure out how to
change the output quality of the .jpg, nor how to crop and *not* have
it zoom in on the cropped portion of the image.</li></ul></p></li>

<li><p>My life seems simpler now that I've lost my job.  Excellent!</p></li>

<li><p>I have some website stuff to do for Kim Sawyer, in exchange for
him acting as my personal coach.  Basically I have gotten many free
sessions for the past handful of months and have not done any website
work for him.  I trust that in the end our barter will be even.</p></li>

<li><p>Spot is still the coolest cat in the world, and he still lives
with me, but that will change before I leave for Japan.  I don't yet
know where he will live.</p></li>

<li><p>I still haven't heard anything about New Orleans Rally, except
that I believe it is scheduled for July 5-7.</p></li>

<li><p>I just realized something I will do with my CDs.  I don't need
to take the CDs I want to have during my travels.  I can just compress
them all the mp3 and store many CDs worth of music on one disc.  I
know, I know, I know this technology is not new, but I just now
realized that I can use it.</p>

<p>One caveat is that doesn't allow me to
pore over the CD covers, which I definitely enjoy doing at times, but
that's mostly when I first get the CD and I'm really immersing myself
in the art of the album as a whole.</p></li>

                        <p class=date>9:22am Friday 21 June 2002</p>

<p>Fred and I have just woken up; today is Fred's birthday.  Earlier,
Dad called to wish him happy birthday.  I answered the phone and was
all, "you're calling too early," or something and Fred talked to him
and then was going to put the phone down but there was no room on the
bed.  So he unhooked its cord, checked for no dial tone, smiled,
poured it onto the floor.</p>

<p>We're about to watch Zoolander on my computer.</p>

<p class=date>11:24am</p>

<p>haha fun stuff.  I had seen it before; I enjoyed it this time as well.</p>

<p>Lunch with Ma next and then we'll see what we do after that.
Flaming Idiots show is tonight.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I just called my apartment complex to let them know the light in my
kitchen will sometimes flicker instead of illuminate brightly when I
turn it on.  This doesn't happen too often, but the real reason I
asked them to look at it is so that Spot can get some attention.</p>

<p>I didn't get a copy of my key made before I left to give to a
neighbor so they could say HI to Spot while I was gone.  Wende has the
copy, but she's in San Francisco now working for 3 weeks at a
Container Store out there, helping them get set up.</p>

<p>I feel bad sometimes about how long Spot gets left alone all day,
and sometimes for the weekend while I go to rallies and such.  Usually
Wende will go by and chill with him for a bit.  This time, Roy will
fix the light, Spot will say HI if he's lonely, Roy will at least say
HI, if not pet him a bit.</p>

<p>I would have asked Roy directly, but he was gone the morning I
left.  The new employees in the office are automotons compared to the
loving care provided to us residents by Suzanne when she worked there
before the complex got purchased by new management.  Pooh.</p>

<p class=date>12:24pm</p>

<p>I just learned that Fred's clock is set 15 minutes fast.  That's
because it takes him 15 minutes to get to school.  "I want to know
what time it's going to be when I get there: I need to be there at 12
o'clock and my clock says 12 o'clock.  Time to leave."</p>

<p class=date>13:06pm</p>

<p>Fred and I are chillin' at some funky arty cafe called Bouldin I
think.  We believe this is the correct address (1501).  We're pretty darn
sure this is the correct street (1st), and since we requested a funky
cafe, which just happens to be here, we're probably in the right spot,
but (!) the right time has passed by a few minutes, and Ma and Jon are
rarely late.</p>

<p>They also don't answer their cell phones, but only use them for
outgoing calls.  Considering that Fred is often really late, they
won't call thinking, "oh god fred and rob are lying in a ditch
somewhere" for another 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Ah; they have just arrived.</p>

<p class=date>13:04pm Friday 21 June 2002</p>

<p>Fred has just received a letter that was sent to Fred via Ma in
1999.  It's postmarked 22 Sept 1999, from our step sister Karina, a
change of address notification:</p>

<pre>
Well I hear you're moving too,
so I guess ball's in your court.
I sent this to your mom to
forward 9/21 - I wonder how
long until you get it.

     See ya!
      Karina
</pre>

<p>Funny!</p>

<p>I really love my new computer.</p>

                        <p>Before going to Mark, Cindy and David's, Fred and I bounced bouncy
balls in the 8 story stairwell on one wing of UT.  We dropped them
through the narrow gap that looks all the way down and got the balls
to fall most of the way down before hitting the side or a step.</p>

<p class=date>19:38 Friday 21 June 2002</p>

<p>Just ate dinner with Mark, Cindy, David: pizza and then chocolate
cake and ice cream for dessert.  They are fun and apparently well
educated.</p>

<p class=message>We enjoyed meeting Rob too.  Sounds very familiar,
same sense of humor as Fred, Mark is looking forward to his letters
from Japan: "M", "A", etc..</p>

<p>Oh, yeah, I told Mark that if he can solve the Carpet Problem, I
will write him 1 letter from Japan for every month he solves it before
I leave.</p>

<p>now we're at the Flaming Idiots.  I'm choosing to not take my
computer in.</p>

<p class=date>22:37</p>

<p>The show was <em>excellent</em>!!  I was most impressed with them
juggling 9 clubs between the three of them, and walking in and out of
one another in a braiding pattern.  So amazing!  I talked to Gyro at
the end and he said something like, "thanks!  It just takes a
<b>lot</b> of counting but then it's just second nature.."</p>

<p>Cool thing was using leaf blowers to float beach balls in the air.
Very nice.</p>

<p>Amazing thing was them getting out of three mutually tied up
straight jackets in twenty-five seconds.</p>

<p>Funny thing was Gyro climbing on and around Jim, a 240 pound guy
who was 2 feet taller than Gyro.</p>

<p>Walter put an entire inflated balloon down his throat.  One of the
long noodle types.  Wow.  Fred said he's seen it before. (Not that
particular balloon)</p>

<p>Before that part of the show, Gyro announced the next part was a
bit gross, and "to be forewarned is to be fore armed, and to be four
armed is to be a freak, just like one of us!"</p>

<p>At one point in the show, they presented a Flaming Idiots T-shirt,
and announced they would give it away to the first person who could
throw their shirt onto the floor of the stage.  I won.  Good thing I
was wearing an easily removable rally shirt! (Plano rally) After the
show I got them all to sign the shirt.</p>

<p>Gyro made a baloney sandwich with his feet (and a woman from the
audience ate a bite).</p>

<p>Gyro also wrote TYLER with both hands and both feet all at the same
time.  (Mirror image on left side)</p>

<p>Fred decided the most difficult stunt was five ball juggling onto a
tympani by Gyro.</p>

<p>Also awesome human-juggling: they leap frogged sideways over one
another (quite quickly).  Thanks to Cindy for remembering that
trick.</p>

<p>Another cool thing was Pyro tossing six coins into the air and
catching all six of them (not in a clump, but alternate hands picking
them out of the air)</p>

<p class=date>23:32</p>

<p>Fred, Bill and I are now going to watch <em>Snatch</em> which I
have not yet seen.</p>

<p><em>Snatch</em> is near the end; we moved from Bill's room because
he fell asleep.</p>

<p>It took us a while to start the movie because my computer didn't
have the correct codec (compressor/decompressor) to read the pirated
.avi file.  Fred downloaded one from <a
href="https://www.divx.com">divx</a>, but it didn't decompress the
audio very well on this machine.  On Bill's Windows 2000 box, the
movie worked well. </p>

<p>Emacs rules.</p>

<p class=date>3:32am</p>

<p>Movie is over.  Wow.  That was weird, and good.  I'll see it again
to try and get a better sense of it.  I saw some scene/line
similarities to Pulp Fiction.  When I first heard about this movie, I
think I heard that as well.  Hmmm.</p>

<p>Bedtime now.</p>

<p>Well, we just used my computer to burn a nine inch nails CD for
Fred.  The first one we played was written in mp3 format.  Very short.
The second one was in CD format, but the songs are out of order.
We're too tired now to fuck with it further to see how to control the
order of songs.  I'm surprised at how late it is.</p>

<p>Today has been a fantastic day.</p>

<p>I have just finished munching lunch after the initial Nova group
information session.  Nicole was the presenter; she has worked for
Nova since 1999.  Taught English and shifted to a job in San
Francisco(?) where she's interviewing people to work for Nova.</p>

<p>The Nova job sounds pretty fuckin' cool.  The negatives are they
don't pay airfare or rent, but the positives are many:</p>

<p><ul><li>Don't have to work overtime, but plenty of overtime is
available.</li>

<li>They arrange my housing and my rent comes right out of the paycheck.</li>

<li>They set up bank account and take care of visa and stuff, and set
up a flight over there, and greet me at the airport.</li>

<li>Local transportation is covered; they'll give me a rail pass if I
need to commute, etc.</li>

<li>Don't have to take work home with me.  The setup is that
classrooms only have 3 or 4 people taking classes at a time, so I
won't know from day to day who I'll be teaching.  Therefore, they keep
all the files on the students and just give them to me when I walk
into the room.  I see this as analogous to them handling the project
management side of work, which is what I don't want to do.</li>

<li>They've been around since 1981, have well established centers and
such.</li>

<li>Other stuff I'm sure.</li></ul></p>

<p>My individual interview time is 12:45, but Clement(sp), the
previous guy just went in at 12:23, 8 minutes late, so I might go in a
tad later.</p>

<p>During lunch, I got a call from Fred and he can pick me up. This is
cool because Jon dropped me off.</p>

<p>After getting my oil changed, I packed slowly and ate lunch, played
with Spot a bit and then drove to Austin.  Arrived at Madeline's
apartment and hung out with her for the afternoon, listening to Eminem
and her music and eating at Central Market and then Casey's New
Orleans Snowballs on 51st street at Amy's suggestion.</p>

<p>While there, I heard a voice from the street, "Rob?"  I turned
around and it was Karen, who I know through church stuff!  Wow!  I
haven't seen her in quite a while, so it will be cool to catch up (she
said she'll call me tonight).</p>

<p>I've got to remember to download my .emacs file when I get online.
I will definitely remember next time Fred and I are goofin' around on
the machine; emacs is an important part of our computer
conversations.</p>

<p>Right now I'm at Oak Forest Automotive (They don't have a website,
and she was all, no one will find us on the web unless they know our
name and are specifically looking for us.  I mentioned that it's like
a business card so people can look up specific details without going
there or calling.) getting my oil changed for $5.00 (before I go to
Austin this morning/afternoon to hang out with Madeline (friend of
mine who I met via the Techno Cosmic Mass in December 1999 or so), my
mom (whose birthday is 20 June) and her husband, and my brother (whose
birthday is 21 June (which this year also happens to be the day that
Wende (who I still love dearly) and I were engaged to be married))
Fred who will join me to see The Flaming Idiots on Friday or
Saturday.) and I've been talking to Buffy, the owner/operator (Maybe
her husband is still the owner, but he's been crazy-busy for years
selling The Step, an in-garage thing he invented after seeing high
school shop kids standing on unsafe milk crates to look inside auto
engines.  His step is L shaped, super sturdy, slip resistant, super
stackable... all the things a milk crate is not.) and am quite
impressed with how well she has grown this business.  They recently
moved to a new location on Ella Blvd just north of 610 loop (next to
Jack in the Box).</p>

<p>I love emacs helpfulness with parenthesis.</p>

<p>Due to the special of the month, the oil change was only $4.95</p>
