<p>&quot;Today&quot; Maggie came over for a while &amp; read while I worked on graphics.  I am
entirely rewriting my graphics assignment.  It is not too terribly big compared to Database, and it
will be much better written if I rewrite it.</p>

<p>I worked on graphics _all day_ &amp; then I went roller blading by myself.  I cruised down to
the Marble Slab area by River Oaks &amp; then back down W Gray to Cecil's bar via Niecy's house,
but I didn't knock on her dor.  I got water at Cecil's &amp; then cruised home.</p>

<p>&quot;Today&quot; I went to graphics and then met Christine and we talked out by her car.</p>

<p>Apparently she still really loves me and I really touched her &amp; Nathan's lives.  Nathan now
knows he has feelings and can understand them and act upon them.  Christine can now sleep when &amp;
where she needs to instead of only in the perfect environment.</p>

<p>Cool.  She is worried that she will never find someone as cool as me ever again.  Dude.</p>

<p>After gymnastics I played Frisbee with Rita and Keisha while Wasseim talked to Tanya.  Then
Wasseim drove me to my car &amp; I cruised home.  I'm feeling somewhat sick so I slept for 2 hours
&amp; then accidentally skipped the Simpsons and I wanted to get a lot of my graphics asignment done
but I didn't get a lot of work done on it.</p>

<p>However, Fred &amp; I used our similar voices to trick Caryl (my dad's girlfriend) and it was
pretty hilarious.  Suzanne feels bad since Lori is moved and I helped her feel better.</p>

<p>Goodnight -</p>

                        <p class=date>July 1993</p>

<p>I went out on a Thursday night a couple of months ago and met some
skater dudes, and we skated down parking garages, and through a tunnel
underground that connects some underground garages. We had to haul ass
through the tunnel because there was a security guard down there, and
we are *not* supposed to be there.  I was not great at going up or
down steps, but I had to learn really quickly in the tunnel.</p>

<p>I went on roller blades to the Freedom Festival out by Allen
Parkway for the 4th of July.  It was super cool.  I met about 30
skater people, many of whom are part of the Urban Animals, a skater
group in the city.  I met a girl named Beth, and she and I went people
surfing while singing the melody to the Hawaii Five-O theme song.
People surfing means whizzing through the crowds of people at high
speed and trying not to hit anyone.  We did great.  We were flying
through the crowds as I would yell, "break right!"  or "break left!"
so we would zip around to the right or left hand side of the next
people clog (for lack of a better word).  Very cool.</p>

<p>At the end of the fire works display, all 100,000 people at the
show got up and left at the same time.  That was a major traffic, bike
and people jam. Cars were too darn big to move, people with bikes
found it too crowded to ride, and pedestrians were just slow because
they aren't on wheels.  However(!), we 30 or so skater dudes were on
wheels, so we could haul butt, and we were people-sized, so we were
maneuverable. All 30 of us went racing and howling (literally) through
the crowds of cars and people and everything and everyone just parted
like the Red Sea. People in the crowd would stop to watch or howl with
us as we whizzed by.  We skated entirely across the city twice during
the night, and I was out with them until about 2am.  That was so
fantastic.</p>

<p class=date>10:20 PM Saturday 20 March 1993</p>

<p>Dude.  Today we went to Herman Park and we were playing on the
swings & goofing around and having a great time.  There was me,
Marcel, Molly, Greg, Will, Kayse (a girl Marcel is soon (hopefully for
Marcel) to date) and Melissa (Kayse's incredibly cute friend...)  I
drove us all in the van to the park and we swung on the swings and
hung on the monkey bars upside down as Molly took Pictures.  I did a
back flip out of the swing 6 times because Molly kept saying, "Do it
again!" each time I performed the back flip.  Then we did a dog pile
on top of me.  I'm on all fours and Molly lay on top of me then Marcel
then Will then Greg then everyone was laying on me and a young 9 or so
year old girl took our picture with Marcel's camera.  Then we played
leap frog.  That was cool.  I was able to bounce over everyone no
sweat.  Melissa had the most trouble because she's somewhat short.
But we got the chain going a couple of times.  I liked it.  Then we
played statue, where I would spin everyone around and let them go
tumbling and then they have to freeze until we decide what they look
like.  Then they had to act like whatever we decide.  It was pretty
cool.  The coolest thing was that a little girl wanted to be swung,
too.  So I swung her carefully and we decided she looked like a pogo
stick.  Dude.  Then we played Red Rover and the little girl played.
Her name was Kendra.  She was probably 8 or 9 years old.  When I
busted through Marcel and Will's arms, I busted the inside of my lip
and I bruised Marcel's arm with my chin.  My trachea is also bruised
and it really hurts to swallow.  So we quit that game and played
freeze tag.  During freeze tag, the coolest thing happened.  A bunch
of little kids were all like, "Can I play?"  "Can we play?"  Cool.  So
we were all playing freeze tag and about 10 10 year olds were playing
too.  The game evolved to having 2 ITs for a while and then we got
tired so we decided to have relay races.  We were just making up rules
and shit until we developed 2 teams, each person runs down to the
first frisbee, runs around it barking like a dog and then to the next
frisbee and run around it like a chicken and then run back.  Then we
ran forward to the frisbee and backward from the frisbee.  It was
great fun.  These 3 kids were like, "I'm on your team!" to me when we
started the relay.  That was so cool to have them think we were so
cool.  Then we kinda did an obstacle course and then we sat down for a
second to say goodbyes to Kendra and the 3 boys and stuff.  As we were
leaving, I threw the blue Haagen Dasz frisbee to Will and he had to
RUN to almost catch it, but he slipped and slid through a puddle
instead.  THAT was funny....</p>

                        <p><p class=note>(transcribed from Books Two and Three of my diary)</p>

<p><p class=date>1:11AM Saturday 3 October 1992</p>

<p><p>Today I took Prob and Stats test.  I got 1 out of 5 correct.  Shit.
I got a 100 on the Discrete Math test that I took on Monday.  Cool.</p>

<p><p>After class I totally didn&rsquo;t do any school related anything.  I
walked Celeste to her class, (She&rsquo;s the cute freshman with braces)
after playing frisbee with her for about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> an hour.  I found out
that she is Kim&rsquo;s suitemate.  Cool.  As I walked Celeste to class, I
determined that she is not a virgin.  I will ask her to kiss me
someday.</p>

<p><p>After lunch with Danielle and Marcel, I played frisbee with Kim for
an hour or so until we decided to go shopping.  She &amp; her suitemate
Paula and I went to Bookstop, where I got Berke Breathed&rsquo;s first
Outland book.  Very cool.  Then we went to Carlson Art Supply and I
got Book 3 of my diary.  (Just in time, eh?)</p>

<p><p>Then we went into Krogers to shop.  I talked to Chris briefly and
pointed out Kim to him and told him that she&rsquo;s 6 feet tall and tough.
Cool.  He thought that was cool.  While we shopped, Kim and I flirted
a little until she floored me in the Coke aisle.  As Paula was looking
elsewhere, I made eye contact with Kim.  She mouthed the words, &ldquo;I
want to fuck you.&rdquo;  Oh my god.  I freaked out but carefully covered my
freakout from Paula, still allowing Kim to know that I knew what she
said.  Later, while we were still in the store, she claimed she said,
&ldquo;I want a fig newton.&rdquo;  &ldquo;No way,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p><p>After shopping, we played frisbee for a while.  Then we loaded
Debbie&rsquo;s room with balloons to celebrate her completion of 5 tests and
1 oral presentation in 1 week.  While we waited for Debbie and
Annabeth to come back home and find the balloons, we made up a cool
frisbee game.  We started with four people, me, Kim, Marcel and Will.
We had my two frisbees going and the game started.  Before you catch a
frisbee, you must call the name of the person to whom you are going to
throw it.  The 2 frisbees would often converge on the same person, and
we were able to often send them both back to someone else without
messing up the rythm of the game.  Very cool.  Maggie &amp; John &amp; Molly
joined us after a while.  Then Debbie and Annabeth came back after the
symphony they had to attend.  The group broke up: Molly to her room to
get Debbies phone call.  Debbie &amp; Annabeth to their room to clean up
before we all went to House of Pies.  Maggie and John to his house,
Kim and I to kiss a little at my van while I got my sandals.  I asked
Kim to tell me what she had said at Kroger.  She said &ldquo;&lsquo;I want a Fig
Newton,&rsquo; why? What did you think I said?&rdquo;  I told her what I thought
she had said.  She told me that may have been it.  She said she didn&rsquo;t
remember.  Heh.  I&rsquo;m going to fuck the shit out of her.  We went to
her room and kissed for as long as possible before we figured everyone
would be wondering where we were.  She whispered in my ear, &ldquo;I want
you.&rdquo;  I told her she would have me.  Everything.</p>

<p><p>We went to House of Pies and got Tina as our waitress.</p>

<p><p>Tina flirted with me and brought me a huge glass of water. She
said, &ldquo;Here you go, Robert.&rdquo;  Dude.  I said to myself, &ldquo;Her tip just
went way up.&rdquo;  The bill came and I payed it.  $28.  When everyone
determined that I had payed the bill, I told them to leave an 8 dollar
tip.  We left 10 dollars.  Very cool.</p>

<p><p>Now it&rsquo;s 1:55 AM 3 Oct 1992.  I have to be up at 7:30 to study with
Heather.  I&rsquo;m also going to the football game at Rice today.  Later</p>

<p class=date>4:20AM Thursday September 24.</p>

<p>Holy crap it's my dad's birthday, I think.  Fuck it's late too.  OK.  Today after shcool Danielle came to Maggie's room with us.  I rubbed her back
and when Maggie wasn't looking, I rubbed (slightly) her breasts.  I walked Danielle to her car and flirted with her for a while until she had to go.
I saw Caleb on the way back &amp; talked to him &amp; his computer for a while.  "Today" was Marcel's birthday, so he &amp; I were playing frisbee by
Lot 6 until his family arrived with tons of food &amp; presents.  The party was most triumphant.  We all pitched in and got him a CD walkman.  His
parents got him lots of food (snacks) a Farside Calendar, book of guitar chords (12,000!) (Oh that big number reminds me.  Caleb's friend calculated
that 1 googol apples, if placed evenly around the earth, would extend the earth's radius to 8.84 * 10^18 <em>light years</em>.  That's bigger than the
known universe.)  After the party, Caleb &amp; Audrey, the 16 year old nyphomaniac joined us at House of Pies.  After that, we played in Maggie &amp;
Danielle's room until 1AM.  Then Maggie kicked us out, so I went down to Sarah's to say "HI" and hug her.  Then I went out &amp; stopped at OB desk
and talked to Judy &amp; Bryce (sp) until fucking 3:52 in the morning.  I have to be at school at 9:30AM That's 5 hours from right now.  I entertained
them with jokes &amp; describing episodes of the Simpsons.  We had a good joking time.  I'm going to meet Linda in Fortran in 5 hours. Later.</p>

<p>D called while I was in the shower and she needed help with the
digital logic.  I was just jacking-off in the shower anyway, so I
hopped out to help her.  We did the homework and then started talking
about sex.  We flirted back &amp; forth about her coming over and
fucking my brains out.  We ended up engaging in phone sex and she
described what she would do with me.  I came all over myself and it
was great.  I mentally cuddled with her and then we hung up.  Thank
you Thank you D.  Wonderful.</p>

<p class=date>3:30AM Wednesday 23 Sept 1992</p>

<p>Today after bowling, I played frisbee with Laura from bowling.</p>

<p>Today I walked around the dorms and ended up in Sarah &amp; Missy's room on first floor.  I talked to them for about an hour and then a dude named
Tom did something really dumb that pissed off Sarah.  So I sat with her for 30 minutes while she described what a crappy thing he had done.  She cried
and I held her until she fell asleep.  Sarah sleeps soundly.  After about 30 minutes of her sleeping, I tried to wake her up.  I did everything.
Talked to her, shook her, tickled her, pulled her eyelids open - everything.  During all of this, I was pretty horny (of course) so I kissed her on
the lips twice.  I didn't tongue her, but I thought about it.  Finally, I woke her up by standing her up and just hugging &amp; rocking (rotate
actually) her back and forth.  She finally finally wake up after a long time.  Wild.  At the very end, when she was awake and just barely coherent, I
asked, "should I bite you on the neck?" And I bit her on the neck and she giggled.  After she woke, she invited me to Two Pesos with all her friends,
but I declined so that I could do homework with Maggie.  So I did digital logic with her until 2am and I got home at 2:30 &amp; took a shower.</p>

<p class=date>3:20 in the fucking morning Tuesday Sept 22 1992</p>

<p>Bobbi is gone.  Bobbi is in Chicago.  Bobbi is in fucking <b>Chicago</b>.  I've had a pissy day today and I think that's why.  That and that Maggie
told me to "have a little respect" for Danielle's (Bartley) committment to her husband.  Fuck her who does she think she is?  I know what I'm doing
when I'm flirtiing.  Fuck them all.  I just want a new girl to kiss.  I just want a new girl to kiss.</p>

<p><b>I JUST WANT A NEW GIRL TO KISS.</b></p>

<p>At 11:30PM, I was at the VAX, pissed at my program.  I should have fucking gone home and been asleep for 3 hours now.  Instead, I fucking called
Carrie to see if she would walk around with me.  She did, and we went to the UC (locked) and then to the Agnes Arnold Auditorium.  Then we talked to
Judy for a couple hours.</p>

<p class="anger">I just want a new girl to KISS!</p>

<p class=date>2:30AM Monday 21 September 1992</p>

<p>"Today" was Homework Blockade.  i slept till 10AM and then went to the VAX until about 4PM and worked on the first LISP assignment.  Then I went to
Molly's room and slept for about an hour until Cindy called looking for Molly.  Molly wasn't there.  (She was at Ninfa's with everyone) Cindy said she
talked to Sarah, who said Bobbi went back to Chicago!  Holy Crap!  So- that sucks.  Cindy doesn't know if it's like permanent of what the heck.  She
said she'll try to find out.</p>

<p>Then Molly got back and we've done Probability &amp; Statitics since then.  She went with me to the laundry mat, and did homework there.  Now we're
here in my bed making out (NOT!) (heh heh) going to sleep 'til 7:30AM, at which point I shall write up my 3 prob &amp; stats turn-in problems.  Later</p>
