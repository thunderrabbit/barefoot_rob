<p>Chillin' at The Melting Pot now.  Wondered what was the dress code
cause I'm in shorts, but there's a cat in an Atari shirt.  Awesome. 
Looks like these are just some buds chillin' at the bar.  They either
know everyone here, or something like they know everyone here.</p>

<p class=date>3:48pm Friday 12 April 2002</p>

<p>Melting Pot was fun.  In the hour I waited for Charyl, Sandra,
Molly, Laura (new Molly, new Laura) to arrive, I talked with the peeps
working there.  It was a slow night.</p>

<p>Xavier acted as our waiter.  He did Chewbacca impressions and was
relatively entertaining, even when he dropped a book on our table.</p>

<p>After fondue, with Charyl's careful timing technique to keep us from
getting salmonella, we talked for over an hour, about all variety of
stuff, but mostly about traveling to Paris (Charyl, Sandra went last
year; Molly has traveled other places (Laura left before we even
ordered.))</p>

<p>Pretty expensive, but fun.</p>

<p>- - - - </p>

<p>Today I've worked and then Gene picked me up to munch at MB, which
we did and met Dude there and John and Heather (new Heather, not that
old Heather shows up much in my life)</p>

<p>Speedy Gonzales = me finishing touches on CYA minutes (Committee on
Youth Advisors) and sent those out.  Now I'm off to Plano Rally!</p>

<p>Oh, I did work some today, as well.</p>

<p>Hey, we're one day off from Friday the 13th.  Close enough, I
think.</p>

<p>Chillin' outside at Northwoods church in The Woodlands with Jeff,
who reminds me of my brother way back in the day when my brother did
everything that I did.  Whatever.</p>

<p>Meara, Brenda, and Penny (Meara's mom) are inside scoping out the
church.  Robinsons and Tina are l-a-t-e late.  Ironic considering
Penny et. al. and I had to drive over an hour to get here.</p>

<p>I told the joke of the kid who loved to do dishes to Penny and
Jeff.  Five minute version.</p>

<p class=date>7:54 pm</p>

<p>En route to the rally now; Susie driving, Jeff navigating, Katy,
Erica, Brenda in first bench seat; Jack, Meg, Laura in second bench
seat; Tina, Colleen in third seat; Meara, me, Graham in the back bench
seat.</p>

<p>When we stopped at McD's to pee, we almost got hit by a van backing
out of its spot.</p>

<p>Trading travel stories, and now school stories.</p>

<p class=date>8:55 pm</p>

<p>Just ate at Subway/Texas Burger in Buffalo, Texas.  Erica got her
meal and immediately went back to the guy and asked for more french
fries.  'There weren't enough fries!' she assured us.</p>

<p>We just found a light back here for me to type.  I was touch typing
in the dark before.</p>

<p class=date>10:16 pm</p>

<p>Meara and I just played three games of Dots.  I kicked her butt at
first, and then we worked cooperatively to analyze how to win the
game.</p>

<p>I'm curious about writing an algorithm that can play it.</p>

<p>HI</p>

<p>I make $48,000 per year, and on my last pay stub, I
netted $1361.20 out of
$2000 gross.   $260.80 to SEP, the rest to federal
taxes.</p>

<p>I owe $5360 on credit cards.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t worked out a budget, but I&rsquo;ll guess at one
now:</p>

<p>per month:</p>

<pre><code> $760 for rent
  $30 for phone  (cell only, no landline)
  $30 for utilities
 $120 for groceries (estimated)
 $120 for fun (estimated)
  $15? laundry
-------
$1075
</code></pre>

<p>My short term goal includes leaving work next year
and travelling to Japan
to work.</p>

<p>I apparently need like $5000 cash to get set up over
there, but that&rsquo;s
without knowing anyone who already lives there.  I
know some people; I&rsquo;ll
continue to research that.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Last night I visited Jennifer at Paint This! to
drill holes in the soap dish on which I painted
Australian, South African, New Zealand flags as a gift
to my new friends in London.  On the very last hole,
when the drill bit finally made it through, the drill
rammed all the way down and smashed the dish.</p>

<p>Fuck.</p>

<p>I felt sad, but didn't cry; I looked on the bright
side that when I paint it again, I can use a smaller
brush and give it better detail.  Oh, and this time
I'll drill the holes first.</p>

<p>Rode my bike to Dude's where I FTPed some London
pictures online.  I have renamed all the London
pictures, and thumbnailed the <a
href='/cgi-local/images.cgi?dir=travel/2002_march_london_paris/day1'>first
day's</a> pictures.  As I write this, I haven't added
comments to that directory.</p>

<p>Today = work and then drop off my bike (to get its
spoke replaced this weekend while I'm at Plano rally),
then munch at The Melting Pot with Charyl et. al. from
investment club.</p>

<p class=date>8:27am CDT Tuesday 9 April 2002</p>

<p>This morning I'm mostly caught up on sleep from the weekend.  I
still was able to wake up early and sort through papers and Things To
Do, etc.  Slowly clearing stuff out of my life.</p>

<p>At the same time, I'm adding some stuff.  I'll be learning Yoga
with Catherine starting next Thursday night.</p>

<p>And tonight I'm going to Marcel's house to consult with him on
purchasing a laptop Mac, either a high end iBook or a low end
PowerMac.  No matter which end, though, I'm getting it for OS X.</p>

<p>Had a dream last night that Kevin got pissed at me for playing
online.  I felt really sad/guilty/crappy.  Quite thankful it was a
dream. Kevin is a low low low key kinda guy.  Very
non-confrontational.  The dream-Kevin was quite different.</p>

<p class=date>11:00am</p>

<p>Forgot that I have a phone call with the peeps in Singapore, so I
can't go to Marcel's tonight.  Poop.</p>

<p>I've been researching and installing RCS, the code management
system we'll be using at work.</p>

<p class=date>11:41am</p>

<p>Booted my machine just now for the second time.  Something seems
screwed up about the way this software is installing.</p>

<p class=date>2:15pm</p>

<p>Now I'm uninstalling the software to try again.  I hope this
resolves quickly and easily.</p>

<p class=date>3:33pm</p>

<p>I just fixed the spelling of Karla's name on our unix box.  It has
been misspelled since her username was created there many years ago.</p>

<p class=date>4:28pm</p>

<p>Re-installed it and now it crashes when I try to do anything
interesting.  Uninstalling it again.</p>

<p class=date>5:19pm</p>

<p>Possibly better this time.</p>

<p>I'm taking Tennessee (at least Memphis) off the list of places I
can live because it's sooooo dry.  At least it's dry inside the
church.  My sinuses are totally clogged and lips would be chapped if
not for copious amounts of watermelon lip stuff. Although I've heard
that if I were to spend couple weeks in a dry climate, my body would
get used to the lack of humidity.</p>

<p>I don't really remember my dreams.  I only remember that I had
dreams.</p>

<p class=date>8:21 am</p>

<p>We're playing Mental Clue..  After the first round, it was Sean's
turn again.  Sean looked contemplatively at Richard.</p>

<p>'Do you have any sevens?'</p>

<p>Funny.</p>

                        <p>I really love her smile.  I'm developing a crush on Lisa a bit. big hugs
and big smiles and still perfectly innocent, at least on the outside.  I
know she has a kid or kids; it sounds like she's divorced her husband, but I
don't have that confirmed yet. </p>

<p>I look forward to getting to know her more.</p>

<p class=date>10pm Tuesday 9 April 2002</p>

<p>Lisa is a physical therapist.  When I told her I had some back
soreness, Lisa encouraged me to look into yoga to help solve that.
Quite synchronous with Catherine, so I decided to follow through with
Catherine's offer.</p>

<p>At the end of the weekend, Lisa and I sat together during the
church service Sunday morning.  We flirted a bit; shared hymnal during
singing, rocked back and forth a bit while seated, brushing shoulders
together.</p>

<p>My ride to the airport was way earlier than I wanted it to be; I
wanted to talk to her.  But oh well; there will be other times.</p>

<p>At the youth advisor CYA meeting now.</p>

<p>We went to Rock and Soul Museum, the first 9 minutes of which I spent
talking to Sally, including having her guess where I was.</p>

<p>Scoped out Beale Street; pretty cool.  Saw a Tiger, but didn't get a
picture.</p>

<p>The group is definitely quite more energetic tonight as Jake says,
"I've head my fair dose of insanity this night."</p>

<p>The younger high school group is tearing around the church.  We
just played Mafia with 21 people, but they were certainly too wired
too finish the entire game, although they suffered through until the
Mafia won.</p>

<p>So now we have left the younger group outside and older ish youth
in the high school room are playing the name game before we play
SF.</p>

<p>Maggie, Olivia, Amy, Erin, Jake, Rob, Sean, Richard, Sarah, Corey.</p>

<p class=message>good rules
<br>rob is on fire.</p>

<p class=message>could you begin the game
with a shrug? or other defensive move?</p>

<p class=message>"The other defensive move is more elegant, refined,
sophisticated, and has a funnier sounding name of schrodem."</p>

<p class=message>Hardcore SF rule:
<br>the football can not move in the reverse direction until a certain
number of fwaps is accomplished. so: fwap fwap (right)-zoom-and all
fwaps must be to the right until they are at the certain number.</p>

<p class=message>"Hey mister dictator!"</p>

<p class=message>"Hey.  :-)"</p>

<p class=message>foot motions now!!
<br>people are confused about the fwap rules. curious because that never has
happened to me. -sean bbbv</p>

<p class=date>3:38 am</p>

<p>The time has just jumped forward 1 hour, and the SF game is falling
to bits; we never played using foot motions, but I did at least get to
utter the foot rules.  Maggie and Olivia are looking for a CD player
now.</p>
