<p class=date>1:12am CDT Saturday 16 September 2000</p>

<p><p>Thursday evening Wende and I attended Warrior Graduation.  Men In
Mission is a non-profit, non-denominational, non-partisan, super
wonderful healing group of men helping to bring men to a higher state
of goodness.. teaching how to communicate clearly with one&rsquo;s self and
others, how to understand emotions, how to live in integrity.  It&rsquo;s a
great thing.  Men In Mission sponsors New Warrior Training Adventures
approximately once per month in Houston area.  (They are held in many
parts of the US and maybe other countries.)  On Thursday after the
weekend training, men are honored at a graduation ceremony.  Wende and
I attended that ceremony this past Thursday.  Some men from my I-group
were there; I appreciated the opportunity to support them.</p>

<p><p>At the end of the graduation, visitors have an opportunity to
specifically honor men who have graduated.  I chose to speak to a man
who had shared that he often wore a suit and tie because he felt more
powerful that way.  And yet, he said, he felt uncomfortable having to
hide behind that.  I told him that I have created my life so that I
can wear shorts and T-shirt to work each day.  If he wanted, I
encouraged, he could do that too.</p>

<p><p>After the graduation, Wende and I went to La Jaliscience to munch.
Wende got entomatadas, and I got spinach enchiladas.  I ate most of
the cheese and beans last night and at the actual enchiladas for
breakfast &ldquo;today&rdquo; (Friday).</p>

<p><p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>I drove to Kroger and upon arrival into the parkng lot,
noticed how dark it was; the lights affixed to the side of the building were
not on.  I waved at them since they might be motion-detector activated, but
it ddin&rsquo;t work. As I parked, I noticed a woman in a truck got out and did
the same thing to get the lights to turn on.  They still did not come on.</p>

<p><p class=dream>She was wearing skates, and we visually flirted but didn&rsquo;t
really speak.  I was putting my shoes on (tennis shoes with laces) and she
just kinda skated around teh parking lot.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Then another woman walked up, also flirting with me.  when I
got my shoes on, they both were walking with me, or me with them, n the
store.</p>

<p><p class=dream>We made small talk about the lights, and I demonstrated  how
each of us stamped or stomped and waved to get the lights on.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Then woman without skates said, &ldquo;well let&rsquo;s stick together
for safety.&rdquo; and I realized they weren&rsquo;t flirting with me, but jus kinda
hangin with me as a security precaution.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I said, &ldquo;speaking of sticking together, does anyone need some
tape?&rdquo; as we had just arrived at a display of various brands and types of
sticky tape.</p>

<p><p>Yes, I made a pun in my dream</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was meeting my dad at Souper Salad again but I wasn&rsquo;t
certain where we would be sitting.  There were multiple rooms to choose
forom. I first walked into the same room where we had eaten before, and
didn&rsquo;t see him until I was about to walk out.  He was wearing a ballcap and
sitting at a different tble.  Amy (YRUU) and her mom Mary were there as
well.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was all HI to them and Amy was showing me a project she was
working on.</p>

<p><p>Then I woke up.</p>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s been raining for approximately 10 hours now.  Not crazy
thunderstorm, but there was a little lightning when the weather firsted
moved in.  Since then it&rsquo;s just been a solid steady downpour with very
little wind.  I&rsquo;m going to go check inside the attic for leaks.</p>

<p><p>brb</p>

<p><p class=date>7:26 am</p>

<p><p>I found one itty bitty leak above the water hater.  The rest of the roof
vents were not leaking.  I&rsquo;ll cll ouur builder guy to have him send someone
out to fix it.</p>

<p><p>I also found a mystery in the attic.  There are air vents that flow from
the attic to the second floor (and even to the first floor) for air
conditioning and heating purposes.  One such vent goes down through the wall
between our bathroom and the study.  but I can&rsquo;t find where it is if I go
down to the bathroom or study.  With Wende&rsquo;s help, I&rsquo;ll find out where it
is.</p>

<p><p>It will be cool to know where it is, because we may be able to put a safe
in the wall there or deposit a &lsquo;time capsule&rsquo; in this space.  just a
thought.</p>

<p class=note>(written a few days after the fact)</p>

<p><p>It rained like crazy on Wendesday.  I was all set to go to
ultimate, but it was pretty much raining even as the game would have
started.  It rained pretty heavily all day.  If Wende hadn&rsquo;t been
home, I would have gone anyway, but I decided it would be more fun to
play with her.</p>

<p><p>We kissed and played a funny new game called &ldquo;I can make any mouth
noise that you can make.&rdquo;  We found that Wende can whistle better than
I can, but I can whistle by inhaling and she cannot.  I can make more
beat box noises than she can.  We didn&rsquo;t sex, but pretty much just
fell asleep early.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>Outside in a playground type area, near a shelter, some
youth yelled &ldquo;check in!&rdquo; or something and we all had to scramble run
inside to not be caught and shot by the bad guys (actually I got the
idea that we were rebels and they were the good guys).  Several of us
ran into the shelter, and scanned our cards to prove our presence and
sat down against the wall as if nothing was unusual.  We had 30
seconds to get everyone inside, and when 30 seconds had elapsed, we
started counting seconds that we had gone over.  I and three other
guys were counting seconds to ourselves, and we were in perfect
unison, cause when the last set of people ambled in, we all said,
&ldquo;sixteen seconds late.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>It was my first time in this group, but I wanted to
give a pep talk of sorts.  I was all, &ldquo;I noticed one thing during this
exercise - the people who came in first, <em>ran</em> in.  The people
who came in last did not.  So let me ask some questions.  If this were
real, what happens to people who are caught outside?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>&ldquo;They get shot.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>&ldquo;and what happens if they get shot?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>&ldquo;They die.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>&ldquo;And are they any use to this organization if they&rsquo;re
dead?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>&ldquo;Okay, let&rsquo;s try it again!&rdquo; and everyone was all,
&ldquo;awww&rdquo; but they got up anyway and went outside.  I noticed two
helicopters hovering significantly over us and thought, &ldquo;uh oh- this
is for real this time.&rdquo;  And everyone essentially ran around the
building and someone hollered, &ldquo;check in!  Confirmed real this time!&rdquo;
and I ran inside to check in, went to the card swiper, but couldn&rsquo;t
find my card at first.  A girl ran up and she had her card so I let
her swipe her card first, then I found mine and swiped it and sat down
against the wall.</p>

<p><p class=dream>We all got into the building faster this time, but in
reality, it was taking the helicopters <em>longer</em> than we had estimated
it would take them.  So we really had more time.  I woke up while we
were waiting for the helicopter guys to storm in and check everyone.</p>

<p><p>Work is sucking shit today.  We&rsquo;ve got this crappy ass client who can&rsquo;t
get their shit straight and I&rsquo;m working on a website that they want complete
in 4 days.  The datasets behind the scene suck and everything just sucks.</p>

<p><p>I shredded my star-shaped slinky instead of throwing my computer out the
window or smashing this new lovely Skandia that Wende built for me this
weekend.</p>

<p><p>I would be very sad if I smashed the Skandia shelf.  It&rsquo;s quite nice.</p>

<p><p>And then to make it even stinkier, Wende called and said she wanted to
check in with me and I told her it was crappy and she said, &ldquo;I know, so I&rsquo;ll
let you go.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Nooo,&rdquo; I whined/pleaded.  &ldquo;yes, I have to&rdquo; and we said bye.
Grrr.</p>

<p><p>Johnny So is speaking esssentially quietly with not much inflection in
his voice.  There&rsquo;s some pretty important stuff being said- stuff that could
cost DJs&rsquo; their shift(s).</p>

<p><p>A new set of meetings is being devloped, during which time the leadership
of KTRU will evaluate each DJ&rsquo;s show to see if they&rsquo;re playing the right
stuff, etc.  Super ridiculously lienient I think is this new policyt.  Maybe
they have to be this way because we don&rsquo;t get paid.  IS it too difficult to
find DJs to cover?</p>

<p><p class=date>4:27 pm</p>

<p><p>Now Holly is speaking with inflection.</p>

<p><p class=date>4:36 pm</p>

<p><p>Sarah and Ben are now speaking quite enthusiastically.</p>

<p><p>The only bad thing about my shift is that I don&rsquo;t get to train any new
DJs.  pbbb.</p>

<p><p>Sarah is so cute!!!!!!!</p>

<p><p class=date>4:44 pm</p>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s so interesting to me that DJs who speak &ldquo;in front&rdquo; of thousands of
people are nervous speaking in front of their peers.</p>

<p><p>I am confused.  Vikki just said that we should not have any dumb
contests, but I&rsquo;m not sure what she&rsquo;s talking about.  I asked, but then
Holly was saying different stuff.  I&rsquo;m not sure if I can say, &ldquo;hey, were you
listening at the beginning of my shift?&rdquo;  type of contests.  That&rsquo;s my
favorite type since I therefore feel like I have some dedicated listeners.</p>

<p><p class=date>4:50 pm</p>

<p><p>Kat won a neon green wig.</p>

<p><p>David won Pretty Princess rings.  Michael won Vitamin C</p>

<p><p>Abi is here!!!  Abi Abi Abi Abi!!  I thought she was all graduated and
stuff.  Yay Abi!!</p>

<p><p>Abi is the outdoor show director.</p>

<p><p class=date>4:53 pm</p>

<p><p>Julie won the circular saw.</p>

<p><p>Rolf won binoculars.</p>

<p><p>Michael won a rubber battle axe</p>

<p><p class=date>4:55 pm</p>

<p><p>Meeting is almost over</p>

<p><p class=date>4:56 pm</p>

<p><p>The good thing about my shift is that the FCC won&rsquo;t come visit me; they
only come during business hours.  hahaha!</p>

<p><p>Today was my first day to join the Northwoods youth group as an advisor.
The group was supposed to meet from 1pm to 3pm, but didn&rsquo;t actually start
until 1:30pm.  I didn&rsquo;t mind too much; I got to talk a lot to Char, a
wise-soul-friend of mine who I&rsquo;ve probably known for many lifetimes.  I met
her this time as a friend through church and through my dad via dowsing
class and stuff.  She listened with reverance to my stories of Wende and I
buying our house; she said the whole situation feels blessed and love.  I
love that great encouragement that we&rsquo;re on the right track.</p>

<p><p>YRUU group discussed rally costs for last weeks Tulsa Rally, and how they
will make up the funds that Susie paid out of pocket for the van.  Then we
watched Monty Python&rsquo;s <em>Life of Brian</em>, which was pretty funny.  As a
group, we did not &ldquo;talk about&rdquo; me joining them as their advisor, but each
individual seemed to be enthusiastic about it.</p>

<p><p>Right after the movie ended around 3, I had to split for KTRU DJ meeting.</p>

<p><p>I haven&rsquo;t been in KTRU for quite a while, but I&rsquo;m here now for the first
installment of my 7pm - 9pm every other  Saturday evening shift this
semester!  I&rsquo;m tag-teaming this shift with Donna, who helped me cover the
shift <em>many</em> times last semester.   She loves the shift super much and I was
all, &ldquo;hey, wanna tag team it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>The funniest thing about the situation is that I have never met Donna.
Nope.  We&rsquo;ve talked on the phone and over email a lot, but I&rsquo;ve never met
her.</p>

<p><p>Tomorrow there is a mandatory DJ meeting.  Maybe we&rsquo;ll meet then, but I
won&rsquo;t seek her out; it&rsquo;s kinda fun that we haven&rsquo;t met.</p>
