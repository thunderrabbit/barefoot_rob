                        <p class=date>12:48am JST Thursday 16 October 2003</p>

<p>Tonight was a crazy filled night with Frank, Peter, Matty, Chris,
Gbenga (pronounced "benga"), Atsuko (pronounced "liz"), Megumi,
Daiske, Sorie and her husband at Korean Barbecue.</p>

<p>My head is a bit tired from all the inanity.  (not insanity)</p>

<p>Daiske sculled 2 beers, each in like 5 seconds flat.  Chris (a
Kiwi) encouraged it.</p>

<p>Peter has turned a new corner and hasn't had alcohol in almost a
month.</p>

<p>I tried to practice Japanese with the nihonjin.  They mostly
answered in English.</p>

<p>Daiske was really drunk and leaning over me for 15 minutes to give
a painfully slow and repetitive, otherwise 2 minute speech to Frank
about how Frank touched Daiske and such.  Quite endearing, but wow.
Quite long.</p>

<p>Liz finally got Daiske to say "until next time" and we parted
ways.</p>

<p>The westerners are at the river drinking and yammering.  I gave
Frank the tape recorder and 1/3 left of a 150 minute tape.  It is too
cold for me to hang with them.  Fucking freezing in my mind, but not
really freezing.  Like 55 degrees I bet.  Frank loves it; I don't.</p>

<br>rob- no one who has gotten to know you, and probably a great number who have only just met you, can fail to be impressed and in some positve way, affected by you.  don't you know that?  you are beautiful.  physically(that's impressive enough for most mortals), more importantly, spiritually(your light  is very bright), emotionally(even tho you get low and frustrated, you are still a highly evolved emotional creature-you don't get stuck on stuff that is only masking the great core issues and you know how to process in a healthy way.  do you know how few men can do that? how remarkable that you can and at such a young, in dog years, age?) and mentally((i'm getting confused with these parentheses)you are tackling the Big Fear, what anybody with intelligence and a yearning for wisdon and peace is working on.) fuck these parentheses. you already have made a mark in this world, rob.  apparently, more than you realize or perhaps, value. that's my perspective.<br>
  i know you want to do more, be the best,famous. and it's your angst that propells you. <br>
  i just want you to feel joy and not pain. i can't help it. that is my tragic  flaw.  <br>
  i guess.

<br>dawg, check it-<br>
i am working on my fourth language, italian.  learning 4 languages (and i include english in this list) has taken me all of 20 years.  thats 5 years per language.  with all that in mind, japanese is a complex language, particularly when presented to the western mind.  (romantic [french, spanish etc] and barbaric [german, dutch] languages are easier to learn for an english speaker).  so, i just want to tell you to quit being so hard on yourself.  you moved to japan with almost no japanese, you have lived there less than a year and you can order ice cream!  that rocks my socks off!  i know this is your first time being overseas and trying to learn the lauguage, and you sound frusterated with having trouble communicating, but from what ive been reading, you sound like you are right in the spot you need to be as far as language development.<br>
i have been taking italian for 3 years now.  i always wanted to die when i was working at an afterschool program in Italy and i found it difficult to communicate at a 1st grade level.<br>
keep your goal to learning japanese for now.  its a solid, good, and difficult goal.  dont give up because it&rsquo;s harder than just showing up and suddenly knowing it.  if you want to achieve your larger goals you have to do the smaller ones first.  dont try crossing a bridge before youve built it.  quit being so hard on yourself!  and dont give up because its hard!<br>
love<br>

<p>Class was quite challenging for me today.  Three students total:
two of the students were Chinese women who know kanji, two of the
students knew English</p>

<p>(this grammar is fucked up.)</p>

<p>Anyway, they were yammering in Chinese at times, and it seemed they
were yammering in Japanese at times (but if so, why are they in the
class?) but then other times they were making errors that I could
detect.</p>

<p>I missed the last two classes due to fucking around with janette so
I hadn't done the homework.  I could barely keep up with them reading
the questions, much less come up with the answers.</p>

<p>Is this (studying) a path I want to continue?</p>

<p>I keep hearing in my mind Nami saying, "please don't give up."</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>I just sorta kinda talked with a computer to cancel my magazine
subscription.  It was pretty much able to understand everything I said
except when I coughed or dropped the phone.   Couldn't quite parse
that correctly.</p>

<p>Two amazing things:</p>

<p>1) they offered me a year subscription to Popular Science for $4.
Four dollars.  They've got to be taking a loss on that!</p>

<p>2) I was talking to a computer.</p>

<p>I took Morisan's bike to the shop to replace the shifter that was
damaged while the bike was in my care.  Actually while it was in the
bike parking lot, and therefore under the care of random bike citizens
who didn't care for it enough to keep from breaking the plastic on the
shifter thing.   I'll pick it up tomorrow for 1500 yen or so.</p>

<p>Yasuchika wants to get a job in IT in the US, but doesn't want to

HI Kim

I am up in the middle of the night thinking about my life situation.

Am having trouble discerning why I'm here in Japan, what I should
focus on.

Original goal:   Learn Japanese, then lead youth group tours to
Japan.    (This is part of a bigger dream of leading tours around the
world)

Different goal:  learn four languages by 2010 (arbitrary goal set to
better myself (as I judge knowing multiple languages is cool)  )

What I want:   to feel loved and free and beneficial to the world

Amazing idea I would love to do:   ride my bicycle around Japan and
Asia, just for the experience

Amazing idea that my ego wants:   become historically famous to Japan
by bringing mkp to Japan, thereby helping to change Japanese culture

What I want:   not have to fucking worry about money

Thorns in my side:  unfinished projects like 100s of emails in my
inbox, haven't written a mass email update lately,  not many pictures
on my website,

Sigh.   Thanks for listening.

I would love feedback from you.

<p>Kim wrote back to me.  I'll call him in the next couple days to
chat and get some external guidance.</p>

<p>It's basically warm today, thinking about being hot.  Awesome!  I
had concerns that we had seen the last of the hot weather for the
season.</p>

<p>Mmmmmmmmm.</p>

<p>Today is my first day to work early on Monday.  I'm arriving a tad
later than I had hoped, but I think it will be okay.</p>

<p class=date>10:01am</p>

<p>So. The shift swap request didn't go through; I'm "supposed" to be
here at 1:20pm today like every other Monday I've ever come to work at
Kawasaki.</p>

<p>Fuck.  Steve remembers asking me to sign the shift swap request,
and I did everything I was supposed to do, but it didn't get swapped.
The request was at his/Nova's request to cover Stephanie's schedule
(after she quit).   I decided it would be cool to get my weekend
started 4 hours earlier, so I was like "cool."</p>

<p>Bah.</p>

<p>Steve said sorry, but there's not much he can do. He will try and
shift the schedule around a bit to let me do something this morning.</p>

<p>This is Friday for me, and it's the 13th.  And I greedily bypassed
Nakayama the monk so I wouldn't 'have' to give him a dollar.</p>

<p>I'll definitely express my non-impressedness to Neil.</p>

<p class=date>6:47pm</p>

<p>One thing that impressed me least was that there was "nothing
[Steve] could do about it," like Nova usagi doesn't empower its
leaders to help the teachers.  Just get ground through the
beauracratic papermill.  But Steve did swap some classes around so I
only had to stay 1 lesson later than I would have had my 8 lessons
started at 10.</p>

<p>Though my free lesson near the end of the day didn't stay free, it
filled with a pretty student I haven't seen in a long time.  Nice to
talk to her again.</p>

<p>Didn't exchange contact information with her.  I'm not as free with
that anymore lately.</p>

<p>Voice was fun; we talked about weather after an awesome storm blew
through the area today.  I woke up and it had rained, but the sun was
shining and it was basically hot.  Then in the afternoon a storm was
just like <em>rar</em>, blasting wind and rain everywhere.  An hour
later the sun was shining again like <em>what storm?</em></p>

<p>I got to tell them about hurricanes and tornadoes and cool storms
we have in Texas.</p>
