<p>Walking toward opening circle I ate the 3 Oreo
cookies off the ground that Bryn and Vessy so
carelessly left.  When I caught up with them at the
circle, Bryn offered me some.  I was pleased to be
able to say, 'I just had <em>three</em>.'</p>

<p class=date>11:13 am</p>

<p>Sang in the shower.</p>

<p>Oh, I'm takin' a shower for the first time in two
days..
<br>It feels oh so good in so many ways
<br>I'm washin' my back and washin' my legs.
<br>I'm gonna go get me some eggs
</p>

<p>etc.</p>

<p>Got breakfast which was pancakes, not eggs, and
have been chillin' with Tina P, including through the
theme speaker, Anita, who makes art.</p>

<p>Intermission now for touchgroup meetings.</p>

<p><a href="/images/YRUU/SWUUSI2001/Elizabeth.jpg"><img
src="/images/YRUU/SWUUSI2001/Elizabeth.jpg" width=150></a></p>

<p class=date>3:04 pm</p>

<p>Did the Anita Workshop - art with ink and cloth and
stuff.  Very fun.  Mark's Peter is playing kickball. 
I'm chillin on TinaP's sheet with TP and Kate.</p>

<p class=date>3:11 pm</p>

<p>AJ just tried to climb the backstop, but the top of
it is so rotted that it just splintered when he
climbed the fence.</p>

<p>Then he scooped up the pitch, and started chasing
Michael A off the field in a most amusing,
inappropriate way.  </p>

<p>Mostly it was funnier than inappropriate.</p>

<p class=date>6:24 pm</p>

<p>Went swimming after kickball, and played Marco
Polo.  I was It and the group went underneath the
dock.  I was all 'Marco!' <em>bonk</em> and the
'Marblublubblub' as I went underwater.  Funny.</p>

<p>Chickenfought with David Johnston on my shoulders
and beat two other teams.  One of them was a rematch. 
I think Tanner and Adam as a team.  The other was
Katie Lerner and Ashley Powell.</p>

<p>Just in the past two hours I finished a little
round pillow with a peace symbol printed on it.  Gave
it to Ann, our cook, as a pin cushion.  Then made a
dream catcher and Tina P was all, 'nononononono you're
doing it wrong!' and showed me how to do it.  I picked
up some of her hints, but added my own style and put
it in her mail bag.</p>

<p>Touchgroup meetings now.</p>

<p class=date>7:31 pm</p>

<p>Agony meeting about money.  We are all crowded into
the dining hall.  I am sitting on the floor near the
mailbags, with the fan blowing on me.</p>

<p>Dangit; we just had to turn off the fan because we
couldn't hear.</p>

<p>Someone stole some stuff.</p>

<p>The SWUUSI staff did a great job of expressing how
important this community is, and how anti cool it is
to steal money.</p>

<p>Stood with Joana in a super incredibly long long
long line for dinner. (Okay, not that long, but I'm
harassing Bryn.) We munched and she told me more
Germany stories - everyone smokes there (even have
smoking areas in the high schools), and they stay up
way late even on school nights, because school is only
from 8am to 1pm.</p>

<p>Stood around outside and talked randomly and to
random people who walked by.   I declined playing
Capture the Flag.  My feet are too sore to want to
play.</p>

<p class=date>10:48 pm</p>

<p>We just played a spontaneous game of Silent
Football, with Bryn as Madam Dictator.  The game was
great fun with Bryn's smiley rules.  'Everyone must
smile :-)'  and we named the universe 'Shiny Happy
People Holding Hands'</p>

<p>Anyone who Zoomed a Zoom Zoom had to do jump shake
your booty dance as the rest of the group clapped and
chanted the song.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Severence lost.  I intentionally was
picking on her (to speed up the game cause we were
late for touchgroups), and then she and I were back
and forth with the football and Danny called us on it
and we each got 1/2 point, increasing her score to 5
and my score to 4.5</p>

<p>We are in touchgroup are now playing <em>Ceiling
Wall Floor</em>, and taunting Mr Sexton, Mr Nathan
Sexton.  (That was his name in Silent Football.)</p>

<p>As I wrote this entry, I just pulled an "I'm not
playing" after the locations were given.  I love
that.</p>

<p>Actually, more than one person has no fucking idea
how to play.  ;-)</p>

<p>Ceiling Wall Floor is a sick sick game.  :-)</p>

<p class=date>11:22 pm</p>

<p>There has apparently been a crisis; we are about to
have an agony meeting.</p>

<p>Someone went into the wrong gender bathroom looking
for someone else of the equally wrong gender.</p>

<p class=date>3:10 am 24 July 2001</p>

<p>just finished roving; my & Pat's specific
responsibilities for the week are over.  Goodnight</p>

<p class=date>7:08 pm Sunday 22 July 2001</p>

<p>Spent time swimming and chillin' on the floats with
Grantly, Amanda, Laura C, and someone else -
Amelia?</p>

<p>Back to the front to register and I got to say HI
to Jonana and some other peeps.  Registered and then
went back to swim.  This time there was quite a lot of
people swimming.  The most hilarious fun was getting
Meg Robinson up in the Darth Maul chair floatie thing.
 We tried to get Bryn and Amy Leyenberger on it, but
they fell out pretty quickly. It was quite difficult
to balance on it.</p>

<p>Back toward the front, where we had opening circle.
 I got to sit by Bryn, .. very smiley.  We sat on her
cool big OZ beach towel.</p>

<p class=date>9:29 pm</p>

<p>At dinner I sat with Joana, who told me some of the
German customs that she found strange.  At meals, they
have no manners.  Elbows on the table, eating like
crazy.  And at restaurants ya have to ask for a menu. 
And they won't give the bill until you actually ask
for it.  They don't try to move people out of the
restaurant; customers can stay as long as they
want.</p>

<p>We just played a primo game of ultimate after
dinner.  About 8 on 8..  Tanner, AJ, Bibby, Amy L, TJ,
me, Joana, Hillary, Noah, Ryan, Mattboy, and others
I'm not remembering.</p>

<p>The most injurous events:  disc into the endzone
toward Amy, who tipped it.  Noah and Tanner were
speeding in from opposite directions.  After Amy
tipped it, Noah leaned forward, Tanner leaned backward
and then <em>BAM</em> as Tanner was layed out flat
onto the ground as Noah crashed into him.  Landed on
his back I think, plus a half twist and lay on his
stomach as we all approached.  He was able to get up
and shake it off.  Awesome.</p>

<p>The other big bump was a four way thing I think. 
The disc was way up high floating down.  I was
reaching/jumping up for it as Noah was running and
about to jump, but saw Tanner was coming, so Noah
ducked/dove across in front of me, as TJ was hauling
butt up behind me and leaped forward, basically over
Paul, as TJ's knee BAM in the back of my hip bone. and
TJ did a <em>front flip</em> mostly over Paul and dive
rolled onto the ground.  Wow.</p>

<p>My hip said ow.</p>

<p>I walked out of the game for a bit, but then played
again.  We played until it was basically dark and we
couldn't see anything.  We would throw the disc down
the field and not be able to tell if someone caught
it, much less what team they were on.  Very
challenging play.</p>

<p><P>Altight, this is Ben again. Just feeling somewhat
philosophical. (I know I proably misspelled that, but
whatever) I just got through ranting at a friend of
mine and realized that friendship is being able to
yell at a guy for about 5 minutes straight, and then
have him ask you &ldquo;Alright, so are we ok now?&rdquo; and you
be able to answer &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s basically it, I&rsquo;m done
here.
<BR>~Ben</P></p>

<p><P>Oh yeah, almost forgot the shameless plug. Check
out my website, <A
HREF="https://thearchive.hypermart.net">The
Archive</A>. It&rsquo;s a kickass blog with me and my
friends (for those that don&rsquo;t know, a blog is like
what Rob does, except it&rsquo;s all automated and super
easy) I&rsquo;m Phantom Blogger and do basically all the
technical stuff, such as the design and keeping the
art and writing section updated. So, if you have some
complaints about how the site looks, talk to me and
I&rsquo;ll tell you to read it on IE 5 and a Damn Mac! (yes,
I&rsquo;m a Mac computer geek) Smeg&rsquo;s a good friend and
would be a YRUUer if it weren&rsquo;t for his Roman Catholic
mother. And Alexa&rsquo;s&hellip;well, that&rsquo;s complicated and
this is neither the time nor the place.  Ok shameless
plug over, happy surfing.

width=150 align=left></a>AJ and I walked down to the dock after taking
a picture of Sean sleeping.  It wasn't quite light enough so AJ had
his flashlight, but it was more light than the flashlight really made
a difference.</p>

<p>Funny that we had no trunks and he carried his
flashlight to the dock in the bright morning sun.</p>

<p>Don't tell anyone, but I just changed into swim
trunks in the walk in refrigerator.  just once.  Just
to have the experience.</p>

<p>Swimming now.  (not <em>now</em>, but now.)</p>

<p>I got to meet Tina P; this is her first and last
SWUUSI (she's graduating) and she wants to attend UH
and get a degree in education I think.  And live out
by the museum district.  Cool, G!  That's near me and
Wen!</p>

<p>AJ told a funny funny joke:  (set it up however you
want, but a dad and his kid are driving down the
highway and a penis hits the windshield)</p>

<p>kid: "Dad, what <em>was</em> that?"</p>

<p>"Um, uh, it was a bug!"</p>

<p>"Wow!  It had a huge dick!"</p>

<p class=date>11:42 am</p>

<p>Just got out of advisor meeting, which was supposed
to be from 9am to 11am.  But a great meeting.  I am
the Adult Head Hydrator, and I have asked AJ to be my
Youth Head Hydrator.  Youth have to have water bottles
at spirit circle each morning, and at each meal.</p>

<p>People are arriving, but there is no registration
information until 3pm.  I'm kinda supposed to tell
anyone who comes in that they can't register yet, but
I think further information (signatures) might be
needed for some people, but there's no way to know
who.  Stinky.</p>

<p class=date>2:16 pm</p>

<p>Been talking to tons of peeps - remet some people
who I've totally forgotten - Tim, Amelia (sp).   Tim
cut his knee but we found first aid relatively
quickly.  small cut. One band-aid worth.</p>

<p>Ameilia is from Springfield Missouri, and she knows
Karla Gilmore, who used to be an advisor with her
daughter Heidi Jean.  Very cool.  Amelia doesn't come
to many rallies, except Tulsa and SWUUSI - otherwise
it's too long of a drive.  They apparently hosted a
rally in Springfield in 1994.  Nice.</p>

<p>I went to the touchgroup check in and promptly fell
asleep.  I was pretty much fully conked out by the
time the whistle was blown.  I asked my peeps to wake
me up by 12.  I woke up at 1am when someone came in. 
so a good 2 hours of sleep.  I'm starting roving
now.</p>

3am</p>

<p>Roving was fun.  So tired.  Roved with Pat; we
walked around the camp twice, checking each cabin, and
the dock and the big field.  Talked a lot.  She is
cool.</p>

<p>We're pretty late.  Wende is packing stuff into the
truck.  Jason is playing our drum to my Caiperina (sp)
CD <em>Reinventing Culture</em>.</p>

<p>I went in to work this morning to fix my Out of
Town email.  I had set it to reply to <em>every</em>
message I receive, but I changed it to reply only to
messages sent only to me.</p>

<p>While there, I noted a problem with the Singapore
survey and showed Minh how to fix it.</p>

<p>I packed 2 bags for SWUUSI.  Actually 1 and 1/2. 
Wende has about 15; Jason has 1 or 2 plus his guitar. 
I'm glad to not be in charge of bringing so much
stuff.</p>

<p>I think we're ready to go.</p>

<p>The song just ended.</p>

<p>We left only 2 hours late.  I-45
south was backed up solid due to an accident, I'm
guessing, since there was an ambulance trying to get
through.  The ambulance was hoping to get through at
least a mile of packed cars.   Fortunately, we were
going north.</p>

<p>Almost at Greenspoint, there was a car fire.  I
barely got a picture of it.</p>

<p><a href="/images/YRUU/SWUUSI2001/carfire.jpg"><img src="/images/YRUU/SWUUSI2001/carfire.jpg" width=100></a></p>

<p class=date>11:36 am</p>

<p>We've traveled 35 miles and have just now stopped
for food.</p>

<p class=date>12:34 pm</p>

<p>We're talking about how to support youth
empowerment; how to encourage youth empowerment here in
'the bible belt' of the UU church.</p>

<p>Talking about the Hole In The Wall at Houston Rally
1997.</p>

<p class=date>1:07 pm</p>

<p>Wende told us a bit about the theme speakers - a
woman named Anita, who will show us some native
culture; we'll get to mold some clay that she'll fire
for us.  Awesome.  And a super casual guy named
Jeruba.  Both of these people are storytellers.</p>

<p>Jason is playing guitar for us.</p>

<p class=date>1:54 pm</p>

<p>Mile marker 247.  Listening to Big Bad VooDoo Daddy
on CD.   Just talked about the movie Dogma.  Wende and
I may ask for that series of movies on DVD for our
wedding.</p>

<p>Saw a blimp and I told what little I knew about
blimps and dirigibles, given what I read about the
Hindenburg.  Jason said he heard that only the people
who jumped out died.  The rest got out when it hit the
ground.</p>

<p>Wende was surprised that the blimp was full of
helium.  I'm not sure why - that it's so much helium? 
Or amazement that helium is light enough?</p>

<p>She says she was surprised just cause she never
knew.  More like she wasn't surprised, but just
repeating what I said as a question, "that blimp is
full of <em>helium</em>?"  Yep.</p>

<p class=date>2:00 pm</p>

<p>Stopped in Ennis, Texas for gas and pee break.</p>

<p class=date>3:30pm</p>

<p>We're in between Denton and Grapevine and I just
yawned with water in my mouth.  Funny face.</p>

<p>On the highway in Grapevine, we saw a mobile home
that said CITS - Combat Information Transport System. 
The seal/logo also said Global Grid.  Apparently it's
the Mobile Training Unit.  The license plate was from
Virginia.  It had a bumper sticker that said: 
"Vorsicht!  Fahrzeug schwenkt aus."</p>

<p class=date>4:53 pm</p>

<p><a href="/images/YRUU/SWUUSI2001/phatpatBrynJason.jpg"><img src="/images/YRUU/SWUUSI2001/phatpatBrynJason.jpg" width=100></a></p>
Just turned onto 77 South and pulled over cause we
didn't know if it was the right road, and then
suddenly the car that just passed us going the other
way, stopped and drove backwards..... It was AJ
driving, Bryn in passenger seat, Tanner, and Hillary!!
So great!!  Hopped out, hugged hugged hugged and then
before I could hug Bryn, they saw a car coming and were
all, "Bryn!!!  Get in the car!!  It's Elizabeth!!" 
They whisked back into the car and sped away.  I stood
in the road to keep the next car stopped so the first
car could get away, and it was Elizabeth Severance,
Adam Hardin,  Katy Lerner, and advisor Daniel
Polk!!!!!  Wow Wow!  HI HI!  and I hugged everyone and
asked what was the deal with the other car.</p>

<p>Apparently it was determined that since Bryn had
been riding with Elizabeth all day, the other car
should steal Bryn and get some time with her.  Makes
sense to me!  They continued into Ardmore, including
to get posters to label the route.</p>

<p>We have just arrived at the camp.</p>

<p class=date>5:11 pm</p>

<p>Jackie Purdy, Kelley Denham, Dan Owens, Lisa Owens,
were here already.  Travis, Marie, Connie Shallin,
Natalie Blevins, Judy Blevins all just arrived.</p>

<p>Travis jammin on accoustic guitar, others
chillin'.</p>

<p class=date>5:30 pm</p>

<p>Dan: "He's just going to wake up with a
raisin-ass."</p>

<p>Oh, Bill-Tanner's-dad is here!</p>

<p>Oh, oh, and for the record, it is over 100 degrees
here.  On the way up, at least by the time we got to
Dallas, we never saw the temperature below 100.  102 -
106.  Aw yeah.</p>

<p class=date>5:48 pm</p>

<p>"Woah shit!"   I actually exclaimed out loud
although no one else is here.  There's a scorpion in
one of the sinks of the men's restroom.</p>

<p>I got stung by a scorpion last time I was at
SWUUSI.  That hurt like <em>FUCK!</em></p>

<p>I actually got a cold chill despite the heat when I
saw it.  He's actually stuck in the sink, but I don't
want to kill him, nor get near him while he's
alive.</p>

<p class=date>6:26 pm</p>

<p>Big Bryn hug and then big guffaw when I heard this
story: </p>

<p>Bryn and Elizabeth in OKC:</p>

<p>Bryn: "did you call your mom to tell her you're in
Australia?"</p>

<p>"Not yet."   And then when Eliz called her mom, she
was all, "Mom I'm in Australia.  I mean OKC!"</p>

<p class=date>6:31 pm</p>

<p>I recognized tina p from livejournal!!</p>

<p class=date>6:39 pm</p>

<p>Wende at the first informal adisor meeting: "Debbie
and I are the 'adults in charge,' or maybe it's
'<em>adults</em>' in charge, or even adults '<em>in
charge.</em>'...</p>

<p>Chillin' on the dock now; have been out here
basically since we got back from Pizza Hut.  Right now
Bryn, AJ, Sean, Hillary, Jackie, and me.   , oh and
Elizabeth.   Earlier, Joey, Lisa, Tori, Daniel as Phat
Pat was teaching them about tachyons and time
travel..</p>

<p>Daniel Owens, and Travis chillin' conversation
talked about our freedoms and  lack of freedoms in
other countries.</p>

<p>I told some of them about some asteroid stufff and
meteors, etc.</p>

<p>good stuff.</p>

<p class=date>3:20 am 22-7-01</p>

<p>Hilarious hilarity as AJ and I tried to catch
minnows and perch maybe.  He caught a minnow for a
minute.  So funny as they would follow the bright
flashlight beam back and forth and back and forth and
back and forth and back and forth and back and forth
and back and AJ was speaking for them, 'oh hey, look
the light is over here!  Weren't we just over here? ah
no man, my memory is only 2 seconds long, how would I
know?'</p>

<p>So funny, and my hand hanging over the dock and my
face hanging over the dock all full of blood.  We were
laughing our asses off, which didn't help our faces
not feel bloated.</p>

<p>Funny too was AJ telling Lisa and Tori that we ate
some of the minnows.</p>

Well, second SWUUSI here, and really don't know what

else is listening, so who's more pathetic? Actually,
