<p>Long time no see for Mike, and not-so-long no see for Brad, but I had
to ask their names again.  Re-met Haruna as well; will remember all
three in two weeks when I go back to SOGO!  Today Chihomi came and
said she enjoyed it enough to come back.  Today was also Kevin&rsquo;s first
day.  Kevin, beard freshly levin.</p>

<p>BH set up a Slack space for MKP Japan where we can discuss creating
the organization and setting up some trainings.</p>

<p>I got a multi-month fix done for AB; now users can use the same filter
on their custom list page as they can on the main list.  I don&rsquo;t
recall why it was set up this weird way before, but it is better now.
Oh, and they now have a recycle bin function on the custom list page
so it is easier to hide and restore things from their list.  (It used
to take 3 clicks to hide an item (and they could not be restored) but
now it takes 1 click to hide an item, 1 click to reveal hidden items,
and 1 click to restore each hidden item)</p>

<p>And I glued a single stick in place for Marble Track 3.  It is the
first stick that will be used as a support for the Outer Spiral.</p>

<p>Saw Miyu briefly tonight at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Apocrypha/events/253866470/">Apocrypha #17, a trip to remember</a>.  Met Sabrina who I thought was
courageous for the story she told about her family.  This was Isaac&rsquo;s
second event, and it went really well.  Yumi told a story about a
transformative experience she had, which sounded to me like it could
be a mixed gender version of Mankind Project.  Chelsea&rsquo;s story also
seemed courageous, regarding personal struggles while on vacation.
Oh, and Yuji&rsquo;s long story was worth it.  I could not have really cut
anything either.</p>

<p>I met Dipendra today, a young man with design chops that far exceed my
own, and even Tariq&rsquo;s.  He is interested in doing the images for
<a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi">ConSwi, our swipe game</a> we
are making in Godot.</p>

<p>We met in a room that used to be a car showroom, but now features a
coffee shop because the car showroom was not making enough money.</p>

<p>I showed Dipendra how to get started with Godot and git.</p>

<p>Now headed home, but I will be back out tonight for Apocrypha, where I
will be telling my TJ Bike story of riding around Japan for 2 months.</p>

<p>Around 11am or so I hope to work on Marble Track 3.</p>

<p>Slept late until 8 am after getting home late after long day
yesterday.</p>

<p>Worked on Marble Track 3, where I have just linked to the main scene
the scene which explains the chopstick falling from the heavens.</p>

<p>Great MKP men&rsquo;s group today; I got to figure out (at least one of the
reasons) why I was upset about people not doing what they say they
would do.  I let out some anger onto my old backpack, turning it
inside out in the process.</p>

<p>Headed to work now at SCC for lesson with Liliko and others (not yet
sure who), then off to Akihabara for GG lesson with Mayumi and them.</p>

<h5 id="17-55-thursday-20-september-2018-jst">17:55 Thursday 20 September 2018 JST</h5>

<p>Hitomi donated her 0.5 hour to Liliko, so 1.5 hour lesson with Liliko and
0.5 hour lesson with Miyako.</p>

<p>Now I am in Akihabara across the street from GG lesson.  It&rsquo;s raining
gently, but my rolly bag seems okay.</p>

<p>(written 14:06 Thursday 20 September 2018 JST)</p>

<p>Wednesdays are usually long for me.  Wake up at 5am (after getting
home no earlier than 10:30pm after men&rsquo;s group, but Tuesday night I
went to The Pink Cow (great to see Traci after I have been away so
long!) for an event for hemp oil that Rohini invited me to attend.</p>

<p>Anyway, got home Tuesday night at like 1:15am to find Lin sleeping on
the couch and then showered so had 3.5 hours to sleep before woke up
at 5am Wednesday, left at 5:45 am with happy tummy full of banana
smoothie Lin made.</p>

<p>Slept for an hour on the train from Noborito to Kawasaki (the train
starts in Noborito and chills there for 30 minutes before departure
(which allows a five minute window to get a seat) so I get a seat and
sleep or work on something for that hour).</p>

<p>We have been playing the camping game in my first lesson at Solid
Square.  &ldquo;I am going camping, and I will bring _____&rdquo; and other people
try to figure out what they can bring.</p>

<p>I started with an easy one, anything that starts with the letter C.
Then anything that was red.  Then Ai-chan did one of anything that can
be purchased.  Yesterday Yohei did one that was tricky for me: any
customer their company had worked for.  He started with Haneda
Airport.   Now it&rsquo;s on me again, and for fun, I started with Haneda
Airport.</p>

<p>Here is the list, as far as I can remember:</p>

<ul>
<li>Haneda Airport</li>
<li>Los Angeles International Airport</li>
<li>Mt Fuji</li>
<li>Kawasaki Station</li>
<li>(forgot)</li>
<li>Milano Airport</li>
<li>Noborito Station</li>
<li>(forgot)</li>
<li>(forgot)</li>
<li>Ranking Queen</li>
<li>(forgot)</li>
<li>(forgot)</li>
<li>Ueno Park</li>
<li>(forgot)</li>
<li>(forgot)</li>
<li>Texas</li>
<li>Shinjuku Gyoen</li>
<li>Zebra</li>
<li>Satoshi</li>
<li>Rob</li>
<li>My cat</li>
</ul>

<p>We ended there, and I hope they solve it during the week or at least
during the next lesson.  I refused to give the answer, though I did
give some hints by &ldquo;changing my mind&rdquo; about what things could be
brought.</p>

<p>After that lesson I worked in Excelsior on something&hellip; maybe on
Japanese for Marble Track 3 website.</p>

<p>I bought chocolate for the staff at SCC for my next lesson.  After the
lesson, we had a Sweets Party during which we mixed up all the
chocolates and tried to guess which flavors would be which before
biting into them.</p>

<p>Then headed to JB School for 5 lessons in 5.5 hours.  Kids lessons
<!-- (with Ryunoske, Itsuki, Taiga, Toshiro, Kanta, and Suzu)--> were pretty
fine cause we can move around a lot.  Then super sleepy in the 3rd
lesson <!-- (with Shige) --> so ate some more candy during the 4th lesson
<!-- (with Hide and Shoichi)--> and was genkier during last lesson<!-- (with
Kyoko, Kaori, and Misato) -->.</p>

<p>Walked back to Kawasaki station <!-- with Chihomi --> and then Lin
picked me up at our station.  So so thankful for her support!</p>

<p>I got an email from Netflix saying they are going to raise prices
starting soon.  They did not list the options that were available, but
had some indication that I could change my plan or cancel if I
wanted.  I was not logged in to Netflix on my mobile phone so I left
the email in my inbox to deal with later.</p>

<p>Sat down to Netflix and chill today and a new dialog box popped up.
&ldquo;Your price will go up to 1200 yen per month&rdquo; and then two options:
Continue or Change Account (or something).</p>

<p>Clicked Change Account and then clicked down to basic (only 1 screen,
no HD) for 800 yen per month.  Bingo awesome UI and thank you Netflix.</p>

<p>Good lesson this morning with just two students.  We talked about
rental おっさん in Japan.  Interesting concept of renting old men
because they are older and presumably wiser.  They?  We?</p>

<p>Walked with Tariq from Akabanebashi to Shibashi while we talked about
future plans for our
<a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi">swipe game</a>. He found a
designer who can create excellent graphics.</p>

<p>Did not end up needing my computer, but I have my rolly bag so no
worries.</p>

<p>Rolled to Ginza Line and got back to my station for 411 yen, given
that I have a free pass from Shin Yurigaoka to Noborito.</p>
