<p>My legs are so so so tired after riding home, then
skating to Wende's work.  About 1/4 of the way through
my skate, I lost 1/2 of the polyurethane on one of my
wheels.  For the rest of the trip my right skate went
b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b when I skated on it.</p>

<p>I was super glad to make it, since I didn't have my
cell phone, and if it became unskatable, I woulda had
to stop a car or go knock on someone's door at 9:30+
pm to use a phone.</p>

<p>I got to her work, and lay down one level up on the
scaffolding outside the building, just relaxing and
waiting for Wende to be done.  I got there early
enough that I was entirely cooled down before it was
time to go.</p>

<p>Wende just reminded me that this (computer) is not
the shower, which is where I said I was going when I
went upstairs.</p>

<p>I was sleeping until about an hour ago..  Started at 5:30am when
the Silent Fotball game fell to pieces, plus we needed to give the
drivers time to sleep.  I moved my self and stuff to sleep elsewhere
when cleanup started.</p>

<p>At closing circle we did the Beaver Song, and right into the Walrus
Song, with no mention of Kris Scott. It's been built into the cultural
memory.  Great job, Kris!!!</p>

<p>I did aristasha with Ryan as my arms until after the Elbows
Together and I was like <em>that's not going to work</em> and we were
just both in the middle of the circle until Bums Out and I bumped his
bum and he jumped out of the center and into the circle.  That was not
my intention; I just was giving a happy bum bump.</p>

<p>Mugbooks are great; they only took 2 hours to make according to
Laura M.  She said she felt the rally was a lot of fun, which is great
to hear from a rally organizer for whom the experience is often
stressful.  Super duper thanks to everyone who helped make NO01 a
great rally!!!</p>

<p>We drove to The Trolley to eat. No french quarter this year.</p>

<p>Ryan flirted with the Shell station girl with silver glitter
lipstick to let us park in the gas station parking lot instead of
finding the parking for the trolley.</p>

<p class=date>10:09 am 8-7-01</p>

<p>Lauuryn to Pat, while Pat is wearing the bunny ears: "you look like
a donkeyrabbit."</p>

<p>Pat: sad face.</p>

<p>"No, because of your mohawk, and donkeys kinda have mohawks, you
look like a donkeyrabbit."</p>

<p>That's funny.</p>

<p class=note>The Biblical Books below I just transcribed from the
sheet Nick used to read them near the beginning of the game.  I'm
writing this note now to assure you, <b>I was laughing SO HARD!</b> I
laughed my <em>ass</em> off.  I had tears streaming from the
incredible brilliance of writing.  I love love love love love love
these beautiful hilarious youth!!!!!  *This* is why I am a youth
advisor.</p>

<p class=date>2:43 am Sunday 8 July 2001</p>

<p>These great crazy wonderful youth have something funny crazy
planned for Silent Football, AND Ryan has a cassette player to record.
they have something crazy crazy planned.  Nick has a Bible and is
<em>Practicing</em> silently. Wow Wow.</p>

<p>Nick is reading from the Book of Shroop:</p>

<p class=message>The Book Of Shroop 1:1 - 1:10</p>

<p class=message>In the beginning the Universe was without form, and
void; and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.  And in
the beginning was the football; and the football was with God; and the
football was God.</p>

<p class=message>And on the First Day, God said, Let there be Fwap:
and there was Fwap; and God divided the Fwap from the Fwizap. And on
the Second Day God created the Zoom and the Froom. And on the Third
Day God created The Shrug and The Frug.  And on the Fourth Day God
created The Shrotum and the Frotum.  And on the Fifth Day God created
The Tattle, and The Penance Point.  And on the Sixth Day God created
Mister Dictator in His own image; in the image of God created He
him.</p>

<p class=message>And God said unto him, Be dictatorial, and dictate,
and give dictation to the Universe, and subdue it; and have dominion
over the members thereof, and over nonexistent creatures, and over
every living thing that moveth upon the earth.</p>

<p class=message>The Book Of Heshesians 2:8</p>

<p class=message>Then Mr Dictator begat Duke Penispotato, and
Heyoushebab, and Heshekiel; and Duke Penispotato begat Lord Cockpotato
and Itshethemball; and Lord Cockpotato begat Hethemiah, and Sheusweel,
and Tubesteaktuber-sensei; and Tubesteaktuber-sensei begat Haggis, and
Master Spudschlong, and Youcifer and the Reverand Itthemshe, who
preacheth the word of The Lord to the heathen; and Master Spudschlong
begat Sir Phallusfries, and Heyoushelah; and Sir Phallusfries begat
Mister Dongkerstoffel, who smote the heinous with the sword, and with
the cudgel, and with penance points, and with the rubber truncheon,
and with the water balloon, because they had defiled the land with
their ceaseless fwapping.</p>

<p>this is your note taker, kate robinson. i am playing silent
football for the first time in about 3 years. crazy-ocity.</p>

<p>reverand itthemshe ((nick carter)) turned on his laptop computer and a
choir of angels was heard throughout the universe.</p>

<p>we changed the move for a frug. instead of moving your knees...you
have to raise your pelvis. basically hump the air. the logic, which
came from the brain of mr. nicholas carter, is that a shrug is done
with the shoulders nick sucks and the hips are the leg eqivalent of
shoulders. makes sense ryan sucks to me.</p>

<p>it took a really fucking long time to say all of the rules. and it
took longer to say all of the moving rules than the speaking rules.</p>

<p>the best names: matt boy: rabbi respect, kate: miss ryan mccarthy
sucks, lauuryn: miss bunny bunny bunny bunny whoops bunny whoops bunny
bunny bunny bunny, joan: 'someone pick a name for me' miss joan of
arc...next, laura: miss i'm so fucking confused, nick gruenwald:
heshekiel, ryan: heelshebub, aaron: the return of mr. d.</p>

<p>ryan doesn't like  my name.</p>

<p>we're finally starting...it's 3:33...something like an hour or more of
rules etc.</p>

<p>ryan talked less than a second after free speech had been revoked.</p>

<p>mr. dictator called on him to speak briefly. that didn't
happen...and he called mr. dictator infidel cock spud.</p>

<p>ryan talks too much...cloven hoof one b my ass ((no wonder karen
((miss llama)) doesn't play silent football anymore.</p>

<p>isn't who a pronoun?</p>

<p>reverand itthemshe always spoke from the silent football
bible...specifically the book of shroturonomy.</p>

<p>i'm retarded.  3/4 pennance points for not paying attention.</p>

<p>i think i'm the only one who noticed mr. dictator almost call
mistress scratch and sniff mistress scratch and shit.</p>

<p>ryan is going to cry. because he will lose. probably soon.  rob is
also racking up the points.</p>

<p>we just found out that the d in mr. d stands for dreidel, and not
devil worshipper as accused by rev. itthemshe.</p>

<p>but then rabbi respect said that the d stood for disrespect and
then said that mr. d was going to hell.</p>

<p>he seems to be going against his name.</p>

<p>matt fucked up BAD he said that mr. d was going to hell...jews
don't believe in hell. rob changed his name from rabbi respect to
rabbit respect.</p>

<p>Miss bunny bunny bunny bunny whoops bunny whoops bunny bunny bunny
bunny invited rabbit respect and mr. d to her burrow for 'rapid
reproduction'. rabbit respect accepted, and heshekiel then spoke out
of turn saying 'tap that bunny ass'</p>

<p>the universe was in shambles of laughter.</p>

<p>aaron has said 'it' more times than anyone ever has. his name has
now changed to mr. duderiffical ((the true eponym of mr. d)).</p>

<p>heelshebub called mr. d a poop head...heelshebub got told.</p>

<p>ryan said 'in short.'</p>

<p>hahahahahahahahaha</p>

<p>lauuryn hopped all the way back to the universe from the bathroom.</p>

<p>ryan's about to lose. sooooooooooo close.</p>

<p>"while we are the real religion, the christians are funnier."
--Miss bunny bunny bunny bunny whoops bunny whoops bunny bunny bunny
bunny</p>

<p>the religious debte within our universe has reached 'ungodly'
heights. the christians are out of control. whereas the rabbits are
getting more celery.</p>

<p>the celery is overflowing in the universe. reverand itthemshe is
contemplating converting.</p>

<p>miss bunny bunny bunny bunny whoops bunny whoops bunny bunny bunny
bunny threw celery at him.</p>

<p>in the most pathetic defence ever tried, ryan mccarthy ((who
happens to suck)) professes that "pennance points make me stronger."
--heelsheub</p>

<p>"none for you, christian!" --miss bunny bunny bunny bunny whoops
bunny whoops bunny bunny bunny bunny to heshekeil when he took some
celery</p>

<p>rev. itthemshe fwapped the bible, and heshekiel said 'holy fwap!'</p>

<p>nick g. aka heshekiel claims his repeated release of gas into the
universe</p>

<p>heshekiel farted at mr. dictator. it was funny. the universe laughed.</p>

<p>i'm trying to pay attention to the game and type at the same
time. it is very hard. i think i'm missing a lot.</p>

<p>the rabbits are bunny hopping around the universe. rabbit respect
obviously is a new rabbit...because he looked fairly confused.  he
forgets the toe-pointing part of the dance.  however, rabbit respect
now lives with the other rabbits on mr. dictator's left hand side,
where he ranks as official keeper of the celery.</p>

<p>rabbit respect now hides in the (celery) brush, camoflaged from
Xtian persecution.  while i, Miss bunny bunny bunny bunny whoops bunny
whoops bunny bunny bunny bunny, imitate Heelshebub with celery as his
'cloven hooves'</p>

<p>Heshekiel is crossing over to the dark side.  The great carrot god
smiles upon the universe.</p>

<p>Mr. Dictator, Miss bunny bunny bunny bunny whoops bunny whoops
bunny bunny bunny bunny and Rabbit Respect remain the only member of
the universe actually sitting up.</p>

<p>heelshebub forgot his own name. so did heshekiel.</p>

<p>the end of the game...nick g. only spoke one time without touching
himself.</p>

<p>the game has concluded. no loser was declared...but heelshebub had
4 1/8 pennance points.</p>

                        <p class=date>4:48 am Saturday 7 July 2001</p>

<p>Drove to New Orleans from Houston with Lauuryn and Kate in my car
Scott without stopping except for directions when we got lost around
the Superdome and lots of traffic and couldn't turn left.  Ever.  </p>

<p>Even so, we were the first people at the church, except for people
from here.  Registered, met Elena, Stephen, Jacqueline, Micah, Will.
Relearned Laura and Kendra's names.  Remembered Katy's name.</p>

<p>Lauuryn and Kate took my bed in a lucky three step process.  First
they went away, then they started saying my name, then they ran over
to my bed when I came to investigate what they were talking about.
Very sneaky!</p>

<p>Wrestled with Phat Pat on the gymnastics mat after playing keepaway
from Ryan M with his shorts.  Don't worry; he was wearing a dress.</p>

<p>Opening circle was small, but cool, though people talked a lot
while Aaron was trying to talk.  We played the question game that is a
New Orleans Rally Tradition, except they forgot it last year.
Everyone writes a question, throws it into the pile, then everyone
writes an answer for 1 of the questions, then someone else reads aloud
the question and answer.</p>

<p>Then touch group we played ten fingers and now they are playing My
Grandmother Has Aids, which is certainly not a politically correct
name for a game that is nothing more than charades, expressing
intangible conncepts..</p>

<p>Good night..</p>

<p>Oh, there are 29 people here.</p>

<p class=date>8:25 am Saturday 7 July 2001</p>

<p>Awake.  I might go back to sleep after I walk around the
church.</p>

<p class=date>10:58 am</p>

<p>Walked around and talked with peeps.  Pat has the good idea of
writing another talent show that inolves him not being able to be
psychic, but being able to travel through time.  Hmmmm.  I'll
brainstorm a bit on that one to see what funny ideas I can come up
with for it.</p>

<p>Ate pancakes that contained bananas instead of eggs to keep them
vegan.  Wow.  they were quite good, and I couldn't have distingushed
them from normal pancakes..  Whatever normal is.</p>

<p>Ryan has this idea aboout sleeping from 6pm to midnight so that we
can stay awake for silent football.  My honest guess is that he's not
going to want to sleep from 6 to midight, and that he'll be too tired
to drive home immediately after the rally.  I'm guessing he'll sleep a
bit before driving home (after the rally)</p>

<p>So I've just been sleeping for a bit over an hour, and I decided to
think of a new long joke.  I got the basis for one about a kid who
loved to do dishes.  I think I can make it just as funny as the
others.  I'll test it at the talent show tonight if people want.</p>

<p class=date>11:12 am</p>

<p>Elena announces that "we're talking about <em>boys</em>!!"</p>

<p>Elena and Carol are sitting basically on Phat Pat, all three are
stuffed inside the podium in the sanctuary.</p>

<p>Funny funny.</p>

<p>I got a picture of them with Carol's camera, but I couldn't find
Phat Pat's camera.  I can't believe he is still sleeping through all
this.</p>

<p class=date>11:18 am</p>

<p>Kendra, Kate, Stephen are making fruit salad in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Ryan, Micah, Jacqueline, Katie, Lauren, Laura are all asleep.  Ryan
on a pew, Micah and Jacqueline behind all the pews, Katie and Lauren
on the couch on the TV room. and Laura is asleep on her side on the
floor upstairs with no accoutrements.</p>

night until noon when the gymnasts left after their practice.</p>

<p class=message>phat pat = soooo silly.

<br>LAUURYN kicks.  yup.  so, i am an angel bunny fairy.  no one else
is wearing their Halloween costume, except me.  this is also the
smallest rally ever, *and* the first time i have met Naythign's dad,
which is really weird.  we are rdg Carol's evil crazy lesbian book and
i am feelin typically weak.  rock on, Wedding Story.  the best thing
yet today was when i told Rob about KT's 80,000-yr-old Canadian
boyfriend and her being naked.  yeah.  well, that or when i washed my
feet on Matt's stomach (it's a washboard stomach).  also, we had a
*super* birthday party for Joan--only two months early--and it was
magical because i had made her a necklace without even knowing it was
going to be her fake birthday.  in other news, Matt has *perfected*
the Nathan walk.  like, he is a *pro* now.  so that's useful.  oh oh
oh oh oh!  and this is the first rally i have ever been to where
veggies outweigh meateaters.  rock on, us.  yay.  [this has been a
message from Lauuryn who is super great, with moral support from Dane,
who is even super-er.]</p>

<p class=date>6:48 pm Saturday 7 July 2001</p>

<p>Will and I are watching several peeps play Risk.  Wierd-ish game,
but I guess I can see how it's cool.</p>

<p>I have tried really hard to help Will feel comfortable with hanging
out with other people.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if he'll ever come back.</p>

<p>New Orleans Rally Saturday Night</p>

<p>haitian woman workshop was wicked wonderful and now i want to learn
creole</p>

<p>sleep now</p>

<p class=date>12:14 am</p>

<p>sardines now</p>

<p>they were looking for kate and I almost found her, but didnt.  no
one found her.  now if we play again I have my hidiing place, but I
don't think we'll play again.</p>

<p>we did play (already) again Nick G hid and I found him, but we quit
to have worship.</p>

<p class=date>2:29 am</p>

<p>Talent show.  I started out with the joke about the kid who loved
to do dishes, and I recognized there are two distinct tones available
in the joke, the ending I mean.  I think it will stick in my repertoir
of Long Jokes.  It was only a 4 or 5 minute version to get the hang of
how it might go.</p>

<p>Aaron Ryan just played a KICK ASS piece on the piano dedicated to
Christina.</p>

<p>Other talent has included Ryan and Travis playing The Monkey Song
as Nick, Nick, and Ryan .. wait. I forget exactly who it was, but the
oh Mattboy was one of the Ryan's above.  I think the first one..
Maybe.  Anyway, it was funny.</p>

<p>I encouraged Nick to do a 3-headed wonder, which turned into the
two headed, one bunny headed wonder.  I was the moderator.</p>

<p>I don't remember all the other talents; I was practicing The
aphabet Game that Lauuryn, Kate and I made up on the way here.  We
performed it and pretty much remembered the whole thing.  I was pretty
sure I would mess up more than I did, but they went a lot slower than
when we had been practicing it.</p>

<p>Ryan M is singing The House of The Rising sun or New Orleans, or
whatever this song is called.</p>

<p>Lauren is singing the song she sang at OKC.</p>

<p>Silent Football now.</p>

 Subject:    Gin in St Nazaire
    Date:    Thu, 05 Jul 2001 16:49:43 


Greetings Space Creatures!   I am a walk away from the
sea! although i have not laid my eyes upon it yet, the
sky tells me the water is boldly crashing onto the
beach.  It seems like i have been off my trail in
Bretagnè for a month.  I can't really say i have been
lost, since i have never been where i am going, and
the only time i retrace my steps are usually because
of the threatening black berry bushes, and since i
forgot my chapps- it has been only in the darkness of
the night i brave those thorny buggars.  I have spent
the last few days in the Swamp, it has been just like
swamps are for me, beyond sacred and mystic.  I think
of Caddo Lake in East Texas as my Swamp home, but even
without gators i feel at home in most swamps.  I even
had the prividlege of sinking up to my ass in mud
twice yesterday (off of the route and then heading
back too it).  I thought "oh what a familiar feeling,
how many people never get the thrill o! f sinking up
to their torso in mud (and hoping it stops there)". 
When i was human rights observing in the Landcon
jungle in Mexico I volunteered to go the the furthest
village they were sending observers to, and it was 20
miles each way sinking up to my thighs in mud; a
couple of meters yesterday brought back good memories
of me laughing hysterically the whole 20 miles.   I
tell you, it feels like I am at the end of the first
leg of my journey, and although it seems like I have
always been on the Camino, it passed all too quickly. 
It is a happiness that causes me to thank the gods and
the earth and the creatures and all the powers that is
making this possible.  It brings me to my knees the
gratitude i feel.  
   Since my last update i left the beautiful city of
Rennes, one of my favorite inhabited-by-human places
yet and after a few days of doing my usual tour of all
the cardnal directions on the map decided with a
little help of a friendly post master in Plèchatel to
walk along the beautiful Vilaine River (means ugly in
french).   I had not walked the river for 10 minutes
before i had taken off my back pack and shoes and
dived in with all of my high-tech dry-quik clothes on
and decided that if i could figure out how to ask for
an intertube, it would not be contrary to my go to
galicia via self power resolution to float my backpack
down the river rapped in plastic and tie my clothes
line to my big toe and swim to meet the parents of a
friend of mine about 50 miles away.  This river rat
would do it!   I was discouraged by people concerned
by my skin falling off because of the pollution, but
people think the worst, i still might give it a try!
down one of these rivers.  It might start a trend in
France and give the intertubes a break from the road. 
So, there I was, discouraged and my brilliant idea
shot down, taking a nap by the side of the river on a
very sunny afternoon, and this guy on a bike stopped
and asked me if the road ahead lead to Redon (the next
city down the way). Of course i told him i hoped so, i
was headed in that direction, but if it did not i was
by then used to being off course and had a map and a
compass.  He was nice and we spoke about history and
philosophy and spiritual or anti-spiritual matters and
he joined me.  I tried to pick up my tortise pace a
little, and i was on the path with my first fellow
traveler.  Later that night he asked me if he could
join my camp for the night, he said "i feel safer with
you", i thought about the nice compliment and replied
that i felt safe with me too.  We talked late into the
night, into the time that the funeral service for my
good friend "The Birdman" was happening stateside.  We
enjoyed the beautiful cliffs and forests of the
vilaine and visited some megalithic stones and i said
my celtic prayers.  Although we never formally
introduced ourselves, we will know each other and had
a good time down by the river.  For me, the "first"
are always intense, the first leg of the pilgrimage,
the first kiss of a cow, of a horse, the torrential
rain storm, the first night in the house of a stranger
that took me in soaking wet, my first traveling
friend, etc.  He rode his bike and i walked along for
a few days, really pushing it harder than before. 
     We arrived in Redon and I knew I only had a day
or so journey before i was to meet my future (big
stretch of a possibility) mother and father in law. 
yes, that is right, i have told a french man that i
would splice the knot for a few years for
naturalization purposes.  But, regardless of the
reason, what a frightful tradition for me to think
about, i don't even really know this cat, which makes
it a little easier.  But the horrid thought of meeting
a mother and father in law was enough to make me want
to get drunk!  In the best french i could muster i
told them i was walking to their town, and to their
house, of course i had to give up my resolution to be
polite, because there was no rationalizing "NO CARS" 
with these guys.  It was a lovely time, I saw over
2000 pictures in the few days i was there and got the
whole family history.
     The night after i got there we went to a birthday
party of the best friend of the mother.  We first went
to their house and drank rum and juice, then about 9pm
we went to a restarunt completely reserved for the
party.  There were about 60 people.   The french eat
in 6 or 7 courses, and in typical party style have
games and activities between every course.  After the
local cider wine everyone went outside to play games.
Talking about breaking the ice, the first game
involved 2 teams of 20 people, with the teams spilit
into two lines.  It was a relay to see who could
transfer the stick from between the legs and run or
hop or whatever to the other half of the team about 15
feet away and pass it off (between the legs) (SEX).  
The next game was similar except it was with rolls of
toilet paper between the legs and passing them off
onto a big stick between the legs of the opposing
teammate about 15 feet away.   Lots more games, but
those are ones to try at your next party!   During the
dinner the french like to sing songs and have alot of
customs and puppet shows and strip tease and so on. 
In the middle of the 4th course the people at the
elder table (3 tables of younger, older and oldest)
sand a song and apparently darred me to get up and
sing a solo.  Well, I can imagine the look on my face,
i was stupified, really wanted to resist, but of
course i played along.  I stood up and told them, ok
but in spanish.  I sang a rendition of "El Corrido de
Durango" at the top of my lungs.  I think by the end
of the song i was not hitting all the high notes,
possibly because of my suprised state, but they caught
it all on video anyway.  Everyone clapped and in
another french tradition ALL of the men stood up and
came over to give me a kiss- or 4. I am sure I was
beet red, but all the glasses were raised in my
direction.   The party was fantastic, one of the
funniest puppet shows i have ever seen. The last
course was served at half passed one, and then we went
back to the house to have champaigne.  I had 8 kinds
of alchol at the party, too much for even this party
animal.  I say, if we do unlawfully wed, the party
will be french style; and surely the divorce party
will be even bigger. 
       I figured out the next day when the mom and dad
were discussing what a hit i was at the party and mom
said, yea, she would make a good daughter-in-law
(beautiful dayghter directly translated), that this
guy had told them.  I felt at liberty to tell them it
was only a jesture of kindness (3 dutchmen have
offered to marry me for naturalization purposes) and
not at all that i was dreaming of anything romantic
with him, in any way!  They seemed to take it all in,
and seemed very honored to have me stay, it was
afterall a bit as exhausting as i expected in-laws to
be.  So I have had a couple of beautiful days in the
swamp and now i will sign off and head to the bridge. 
A few disclaimers; i have still not got the hang of
the french keyboard- the q's are a's and the ; are ,
and the : are. or something like that.  I tried to put
all the addresses on Bcc, but it didn't work.  I am
not really up on cyber courtesey, but I would like to
try to err on the side of privacy.  So until the next
time, i hope ya'll are having fun being flung through
the universe!  Give yourself a big hug and as my
french is getting better so is my cowish.  Take a deep
breath (stomach deep) and from under the breast bone
and with the mouth closed start a big MOOOO, it starts
slowly and rumbles up through the throat and into the
mouth and open the mouth and feel the frontal and
parietal plates of the skull reverberate.  It feels so
good!  I recommend trying it at least a half-a-dozen
times just to get the hang of it.  Don't hold back,
and try not to be shy if you are at work or in a
public place, i think this might be contagious, it
might be a little acquard at first, but when the whole
office really gets into it, you will be happy you
tried, and remember if you like it...do it again
tomorrow.
      Love and Laughs, gin

<p>Tonight I went to Meg and Abi's house, which I had heard a lot
about, but had never previously visited.  It's not actually their
house, they're renting it, and it's not just theirs; there are two
other room mates there.</p>

<p>The idea was to play a board game, but instead we hung out in the
kitchen a bit, munching chips and guacamole and salsa and Meg's Custom
Dip, while talking to their friend Hassan (sp), who was happy with
talking, but immediately had to leave when Meg suggested we play a
game.</p>

<p>I toured their house, enjoying the college-decor, including Meg's
dada bedroom, where every piece of furniture is being used in a way it
was not designed.  ... except that it was still being used as
furniture.</p>

<p>Abi, Meg and I played mental clue; I guessed Meg's choice in 3
tries; she had picked the last items on each list.  We had written the
possible items on the dry erase board so that we knew for certain from
what people/places/things we could choose.</p>

<p><pre>
people       places         things
Heather     living room    cat
Alexis      France         lightnet
Sarah       RMC            baby head
Holly V     galapagos      arsenic
David C     beach          air
</pre></p>

<p>The list of people is correct, and the others are close to correct.
By correct, I mean what was written on the white board.</p>

<p>After the game, at Meg's request, I recited the rules to Silent
Football.  Abi said it sounded like a fun game to play with some KTRU
peeps.  That would definitely be fun.</p>

<p>Meg and I talked a lot about YRUU, and when we started going
through names and names of people, searching our brains for names that
we both knew, Abi began to fall asleep.  She went to bed, and Meg and
I just talked a <em>lot</em> of YRUU stuff and stories and rumors and
such.  Tons of fun!!</p>

<p>I told her brief versions of all my Long Jokes, and we
talked/gossipped some about KTRU.  Also more YRUU talking.</p>

<p>I'm tired; going to bed.  Thank you Meg for a lovely evening!</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>My 4th of July celebration culminated in a big awesome way.</p>

<p>Today Wende and I were lazy, and pretty much didn't do anything but
make 2 batches of cookies until 5:30pm, when I was laying on the floor
in a god-my-life-is-so-boring type way, and Wende suggested we go rent
another movie and get Taco Bell for dinner.  This idea relatively
perked me up, and we went.</p>

<p>We had a coupon for rent 2 get 1 free; so I chose <em>Being John
Malkovich</em> and <em>Shanghai Noon</em>.  Wende chose <em>Coyote
Ugly</em>.</p>

<p>Watched <em>Being John Malkovich</em>, and I must say I really
liked it.  I really liked it.  Wende thought she didn't like it at
first, but then she did.  I *loved* the story.  Who thought of that
craziness?  What brilliance in writing!</p>

<p>As <em>soon</em> as it was over, we ran to next door to Jennifer
and Lance's house to sit on their roof and watch fireworks.  We
brought cookies and met some of their friends.  We saw fireworks over
Allen Parkway, and at The Galleria.  They didn't have fireworks off
the downtown buildings, or from the American General building.  It was
still a good show.</p>

<p>As soon as it was over, we left and I hopped on my bike to ride
through all the nutty traffic.  Cars <em>packed</em> in all directions
trying to leave the Allen Parkway area.  I mostly rolled slowly and
smoothly between them, smiling at those who caught my eye.</p>

<p>Up Allen Parkway and stopped by the tank.  Determined that it
didn't mar the asphalt because it's got rubber caps over all the
treads on the tracks.  The guy there said it would still mark asphalt
if it's hot.  Oh, and that last year they had to turn the tank around
and fucked up the curb a bit.  The City wasn't too happy about that.
This year the tank spilled about 50 gallons of diesel fuel on the
asphalt.  He pointed out the spot.  4 by 5 feet or so.  Kinda covered
in whiteish dust as if they tried to sop most of it up.  Definitely a
spot that will be there a long time.</p>

<p>I eased slowly further up Allen Parkway and saw a big-ass TV screen
about 30 feet in the air.  Hmmm.  It was pretty much too far away for
me to tell anything about it.</p>

<p>Normal festival stuff.  Jewelry, food, trinkets.  Saw a guy with a
guilotine lookin' thing and upon further inspection, I determined it
was a press of some sort.  Not like a printing press, but a squishing
press.</p>

<p>"What do you squish with this?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Coins."</p>

<p>He proceeded to tell me the weight was like 150 pounds but exerted
a pressure of 14000 pounds when put on the coin.  Pressure equals mass
over area.  Wow.</p>

<p>He's from Waco and I told him I hoped the trip was worth it.  It
was.  There will be a booth set up at RenFest this fall.  The guy who
will be staffing it is named .... crud I don't remember.  Oh well.</p>

<p>I continued toward the TV and guessed that it was about 20 by 25
feet.  That was my guess.  Really.  But oh my gosh.  Even better:  It
was on a "post" like a billboard coming out of the top of the trailer
of an 18 wheeler.</p>

<p>What are you talking about??? you may ask.</p>

<p>Okay.  Imagine a big screen TV in the trailer of an 18 wheeler.  So
that if they open the side of the trailer, you could watch TV.  But
they don't open the side of the trailer.  And it's not made of glass.
So..  they push the TV out the top of the trailer on a collapsible
column thing.  Then they rotate it 90 degrees.  (I presume they can
rotate it up to 180 degrees either direction; I didn't ask.)
WOW!!</p>

<p>I did ask how big it is.  20 by 27 feet.  Wow!  And how many
pixels.  The guy guessed about 50,000 (I think).  He said it was 16
pixels times 12 things times 367 bigger things.  I confirmed 12 X 16 X
367.  Then I asked how 367, which didn't seem to be the product of
anything useful.  Well, there's 13 X 26 panels, each with 16 X 12
pixels.</p>

<p>Okay. 13 * 36 = 338.  Not 367.  but close.</p>

<p>12 * 16 = 192 pixels per panel.</p>

<p>338 * 192 = 64,896 pixels.  Nice.  He was pretty close.</p>

<p>Some other guy, who apparently needed a bigger TV for his house,
asked how much it cost.  $5 million.</p>

<p>I asked for the URL to their company.  He said either <a
href="https://www.screenworks.com">https://www.screenworks.com</a> or <a
href="https://www.bccvideo.com">https://www.bccvideo.com</a>.  However,
I don't see anything on these sites that looks like a big-ass TV in a
trailer.</p>

<p>Saw a huge pile of cars trying to get out of Allen Center parking
garage.  So I rode over to investigate.  Super casually I rode inside,
hoping the cops wouldn't care.  They didn't.  A line of cars greeted
me as I rolled in, one girl driver with a big smile.  I rode up 3
levels of garage, all of which were packed with cars.  The top level
wasn't moving <em>at all</em>.  The cars were in line, but people were
standing outside their cars, talking, or looking out over the edge of
the garage.</p>

<p>A couple people asked me why they weren't moving.  I explained that
it was solid cars all the way up.</p>

<p>The fourth and fifth levels were basically empty.  Except for a few
cars on 4 that were just chillin' waiting for the traffic to go away.
And 1 truck on the fifth level, with a man and maybe his 6 year old
son looking over the wall.  I talked to them a bit and then rode out.
Mostly slowly, but a little bit fast when it was safe to go down the
hills of the garage.  The traffic was noticeably lower.  The third
level was clear.</p>

<p>Rode by Hyatt Regency and so stunned and surprised to see the new
valet parking area where there used to be just a sidewalk and some
tables.  Now it's a paved driveway thing.  Been there a couple years
now according to the guy.  Wow!  It looks really nice.</p>

<p>To Bayou Place and the old Jones Plaza (which is being converted
into an outdoor amphitheater) and rode down the steps by Wortham
Theater down into Buffalo Bayou.  Saw some images celebrating the
first 150 years of Houston / Texas history.  One of the images was of
a woman and girl in a boat during a flood.  Please know that this
image was well under water in our most recent flood.  Very ironic.
:-)</p>

<p>It's 1am and I'm really tired, but I have two more cool things to
write.</p>

<p>(1) Meandered back to Allen Parkway, including zipping down the
entrance ramp thing that I did last night, and this time I checked
more carefully for barriers.  This time they were out of the way and I
zipped between them safely, easily, and quickly.  Quite fast.</p>

<p>(2) Rollin' slowly along Allen Parkway, I noticed the tank seemed
to have left.  I looked for the diesel fuel spot on the ground, and
found it.  I was surprised to also find tracks on the ground.. and
ripped up grass.. and tracks sideways on the street.  They turned it
around this year too.  But the curb was all intact.  At least
that.</p>

<p>It seemed to be quite gone.  Except on the other side of Allen
Parkway there was a heavy duty flat bed trailer with 16 wheels on it.
16 wheels just on the back of the trailer.  The cab of the truck had
14 wheels, though 1 axle ( = 8 wheels) were lifted off the ground.
The cab was parked some distance away from the trailer.  What in the
heck were they planning to carry with this?  I saw nothing nearby that
qualified for such a heavy duty trailer.</p>

<p>Rolled down the hill toward Taft and saw it.  Belching black
smoke-exhaust and a din to match, the tank was rolling down toward
Taft to U turn to the other side of Allen Parkway!!</p>

<p>AND!  And!!!!! there was a girl riding on the tank!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>How did she get to ride on the tank?  What about me???  Oh my gosh
that is so coool!  And fucking loud!</p>

<p>I really barely started to get an appreciation for *not* having a
war near me.  For *not* having tanks up and down our street.  *not*
having black smoke exhaust and a din to match.  So much loudness and
destruction.  So much exhaust just driving the thing on the street.
Fuck that.</p>

<p>But some girl got to ride on the tank!  I waved to her as it drove
by, then rode as close behind as possible and still not breathe gross
exhaust, which was being blown north by the slight breeze.  The tank
drove up onto the trailer and parked.  Turned off the engine and the
girl climbed down.</p>

<p>I asked how she got to ride on it.  She didn't speak English.  "Por
que usted manaje el tank?"  I asked.  "Wha??  I didn't drive it." she
replied.  So she knows some English.  "Pero, sientete on el tank.  Por
que?"  "For fun."</p>

<p>I didn't know how to ask what I wanted to ask, until she left, and
I recognized I could have asked, "Quien conoce que habla que clara,
por favor sientete sobre el tank!" Or something.  Oh well.</p>

<p>I pretty much got my answer as she walked around the truck, kinda
hugged the truck driver, got into the escort truck.  I never saw who
was driving the tank.  Maybe s/he was still in the tank?</p>

<p>The cab of the trailer backed up to the trailer, lifted it about 8
inches.  That was all the clearance they had on this crazy thing!  So
HEAVY was the tank as the frame of the cab was squished about 8 inches
when the weight of the trailer was lifted from the ground.  Wow.  In
the process a big piece of metal fell off the truck onto the street.
The truck guy saw it, but didn't pick it up.</p>

<p>They chained the tank down on all four corners, and tightened them
super duper tight with ratchet things.  Two cops got on their
motorcycles to escort this monster back to its house.  The truck
driver got in the cab of the truck. </p>

<p><em>Wait!!</em> I thought.  <em>They can't leave yet!!</em> I rode
up toward the cab of the truck and motioned to the driver.  He
immediately saw me and I pointed back toward the truck.  He didn't
know what I was talking about, so he got out.</p>

<p>"There's a piece of metal on the street."</p>

<p>I led him back to where cab meets trailer and pointed.  He was
like, "oh thank you!  I forgot!"</p>

<p>Yes.  I saved the day.  That piece of metal wasn't being used in
the current configuration; he just tossed it onto the back of the cab
between the wheels.  But certainly that would have cost about $50 to
replace.  It was a big hunk of metal.  About the size of a
breadbox.</p>

<p>They drove off.  Two cop cars, this huge tank on a truck, then the
pickup truck, including a real live tankgirl.  As they drove down
Allen Parkway, I rode after them, kicking all the way up into topmost
gear 24 to catch up with them.  Fortunately for my thighs, we were
going slightly downhill.  I caught up with them at the corner of Allen
Parkway and Montrose.  None of them seemed to notice me though.
That's alright.  I got to haul ass in 24th gear down a hill, and see
the monstrous trailer roll up onto the curb on the way around the
corner.  I wonder where the tank lives.  Oh, it's named Mathilda.  And
I got a brochure; let me see if they have a URL.</p>

<p>Ah. <a href="https://www.texasmuseum.org">www.texasmuseum.org</a>,
but I don't see any images of tanks, much less a picture of
Mathilda.</p>

<p><p><b>Comment:</b>
<br>Excerpt from your journal entry for Thursday, July 5th, 2001:<br>
<br>
&ldquo;&hellip;and rode down the steps by Wortham Theater down into Buffalo Bayou. Saw some images celebrating the first 150 years of Houston / Texas history.&rdquo; <br>
<br>
Sesquicentennial Park! I did all the electrical in the park, it was the last job I did before being hired at the school full-time.  You remember the stainless steel artsy towers between the Wortham and the bayou?  I put the lights in those.  And the red button that makes the bubbles in the bayou?  Wired all that too!  Do you know what I am talking about?<br>
<br>
We often do an urban bike ride starting at Memorial Park, following the bayou into downtown.  The Ses. Park is one of the highlights, we cruise down the big circular path, past the towers, back up the switchbacks over by Bayou Place, and then hit the other parks on the west side of downtown.  Sometimes we head to Hermann Park from there via Fannin, cruise around and play, then head back to Memorial Park by way of railroad tracks and HL&amp;P right-of-ways and whatever.<br>
<br>
Fun stuff for sure.<br>
