<p class=date>8:15 AM Saturday March 14, 1992</p>

<p><p>Last night after work, I went to a dance at the OB ballroom with
Jodi.  The music was cool and loud.  We danced for a couple hours
until it ended at midnight.  Laura arrived at about 10:30 or 11:00.
This was kinda unfortunate, as I wanted to spend all my time with
Jodi. It was OK, through, since Laura didn&rsquo;t dance.  Near the end,
they gave away the door prizes.  Jodi and I won Both of them! That was
so cool.  The envelopes were labeled &ldquo;3 Passes to Arby&rsquo;s&rdquo; and &ldquo;3
Passes to James Coney Island&rdquo; or something.  So that&rsquo;s a pretty good
idea of what they are.  Near the end of the dance, they started
playing slow songs.  So Jodi and I slow danced and I told her that I
wanted to spend the night with her.  So we agreed for me to meet her
at her room after I take Laura to <em>her</em> room.  It didn&rsquo;t work
out exactly right.. Laura walked me out to the van, and on the way I
told Laura that I wanted to go out with Jodi.  Laura immediately went
into a long speech(?) argument(?) soliloquy(?) about how Jodi wouldn&rsquo;t
go out with me because Jodi wants a committment, blah blah blah.  I
had a hard time Listening to her, since Jodi had already agreed to
spend the night with me.  Finally Laura said, &ldquo;ok. go talk to
Jodi&ndash;but she&rsquo;ll tell you the same thing.&rdquo;  So I went to Jodi&rsquo;s, and
we immediately left for my house.  We got ready for bed, and then lay
in bed for quite a while talking.  I told Jodi what happened between
Laura and I.  We both agreed that it was kinda sad, but that Laura was
being kind of greedy.  We also determined that we would both like to
live alone together this summer, as having Laura would complicate
stuff pretty badly.</p>

<p><p>We also talked about Jodi&rsquo;s desire for a committment.  She said
basically that she would go out with me and I could go out with anyone
up until this summer.  Then it would be my decision whether or not I
want a committment from Jodi.  If I choose to stay with her then Jodi
says, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re mine.  I won&rsquo;t stand for any fooling around.&rdquo;  If I
choose not to stick with her then that&rsquo;s OK.  The decision will be
entirely up to me.  Dude. what a decision.  After that, we slept until
about 5:30 when we started kissing and I gave her a pretty good all
over body massage.</p>

<pre>12 lines skipped</pre>

<p><p>We slept for a bit and then took a shower together.  She&rsquo;s not one
for long showers, though.  Maybe I&rsquo;ll try to work on that with her.
We slept for a while longer and then she had to get going.  She&rsquo;s
going to the beach today, Oh- and right now she&rsquo;s with Laura..  I
wonder how they will interact&hellip;. I need to get going to work.  I&rsquo;m
going out afterward with Cheryl (from work).  We were originally going
to see a movie, but I might try to cut that down to just Marble Slab
and a walk at Herman Park area.  I have to do homework.  I&rsquo;ve got a
test Monday in Calc III and Wednesday in Discrete.  and a program due
on Thursday and Physics due Tuesday.  Holy shit&hellip; Then it&rsquo;s Spring
Break and Laura will be gone! and Jodi will be here!!! Ultimate.  I
told Jodi that I&rsquo;m going to spend a lot of time with her.  I wonder if
this is IT&hellip;</p>

<p class=date>Friday the 13th of March 1992 12:30AM</p>

<p><p>I told Laura that Jeanine and I did &ldquo;something&rdquo;. Laura thinks we
just kissed, which is fine with me.  I just got back from 24 hours of
school stuff.  Last night we saw <em>Blame it on the
Bellhop</em>. Pretty good movie.  Then I spent the night with
Jeanine. We didn&rsquo;t do anything but kiss a tiny bit.  Jeanine later
talked to Laura and then to me.  Jeanine told me that she would no
longer sleep with me or kiss me since it will hurt Laura.  She said
that if/when Laura and I break up naturally, that I should call
Jeanine.  Cool.</p>

<p><p>Also today, Jodi and I talked.  I told her that I was receiving
mixed signals from her.  Like her major flirting with me, and then not
doing anything.. I told her that I would Love to go out with her.  She
agreed.  She said that she would love to go out with me, but if we did
now, it would be for the &ldquo;wrong reasons.&rdquo;  She was stating
(accurately) that our relationship would be built on sex and therefore
not last too long.  She said that she would like us to get to know
eachother and then start going out.  That is ultimately cool with me.
I am so so impressed that she is willing to spend some time for me and
get to know me.  I really appreciate that.  So, since she&rsquo;s going to
be living with me this summer, we&rsquo;ll get to know/do eachother then.
Dude.  I am incredibly looking forward to talking more with Jodi; I
want to call her now, but it is pretty late.  Oh, our talk was
beautiful. We talked while sitting/lying on the hill by the rock water
fountain.  The day was beautiful. Sun, light clouds.  Gorgeous.  Jodi
and I have a lot in common, too.  I threw her keys into the water for
fun. :)</p>

<p><p>Also today, Marcel and I played &ldquo;Olympic 20 foot frisbee hurling&rdquo;
at a Sprite can on the corner of one of the tables in the Quad
courtyard.  We were crazy. We were making up characters and yelling
and doing instant slow motions and zoom shots, Cool Cool.  We were
also audible throughout the dorms!! Alright! We also took his friend
from the Navy, Chris, to play frisbee at the library field, and then
to Social Work to play on the VAX.  Chris and Marcel called Chris&rsquo;
base in Maryland.  Then we played on the escalators at Agnes
Arnold. That was super fun.  We also threw the frisbee from ground to
walkway between PGH and AH.</p>

<p><p>We got back and everyone was gone from Laura&rsquo;s room to see the Lawn
Mower Man.  dude.  Laura is in a MUCH better mood right now, so that&rsquo;s
ultimately cool, too.  See ya later</p>

<p class=date>6PM, Sunday afternoon, March 8, 1992</p>

<p>After school and work on Friday, I went back to the school since
they were having the Cougar Preview.  At 9:30PM we went to the ice
cream social.  We located Fred, so he was there.  We ate ice cream and
then played frisbee for a couple hours just outside OB.  That was
cool.  We all ran hard.  I entertained the girls with my impressions
and overall good looks.  Hmmm I need to speed this up.  We snuck the
Cougar brats (Fred, & Patty) to House of Pies. Forget all that.  The
real thing I want to tell you: Last night Molly, Jodi, Greg & Jeanine
picked up Fred and I and took us to HOPies.  After that I went to
watch Memphis Belle at Jodi's while Fred stayed here to sleep.  On the
way there, (Jeanine and I drove separately) Jeanine and I talked about
making out, etc.  We kissed just outside of Bates just before the
movie.  After the movie, Jen and I went up to her room and made out.
We kissed and then...</p>

<!-- I had her shirt off and sucked on her breasts and neck.  Then she had my shirt off then my pants off and she gave me head for a bit.  Then I took
her (short) shorts off and ate her out.  Then I climbed back on top of her and we fucked.  It was great.  I squirted on her chest and rested for a
second.  Then we hopped into the (hot) shower.  It was great.  The lights were off, so we could only feel eachother and the water pounding hard upon
us.  It was so hot.  We fucked some more in there, sitting down and standing from behind.  I soaped up my dick and her pussy.  She didn't complain
that it burned or stung as Tammy would have.  Oh it was so fantastic!  I loved the water pounding on us as I pounded her from behind and fingered her
clit from the front.  After the exertion and the hot water, I almost passed out when I sstopped.  So I sat down in the shower.  She tried to ride me,
but I was too tired... We got out and -->

<p>... found the bathroom floor to be soaked.  She didn't seem too
worried about it.  It was about 3am.  We slept until about 6am when I
got up and went home to sleep until 8:30 when I had to get up for work
today.  All day during work I thought about our adventure.  I'd love
to do it again.  Right now Laura is on her way over to talk about "a
couple of things."  We'll see what happens.  Later</p>

<p class=date>10:30AM Friday, March 6, 1992</p>

<p><p>Tammy is gone.  I am late for school right now.  Yesterday after
school I helped Tammy move.  Between classes, I played on the
escalators with Molly and Jeanine.  During class, Jeanine and I wrote
notes and flirted.  After class (before physics) Jeanine and I had
lunch together and determined that we both would enjoy making out
together.  Cool.</p>

<p><p>In addition to escalators, I climbed a tree down by Agnes Arnold
underground, shimmied up a slot up Agnes Arnold, threw Jeanine&rsquo;s books
onto balcony outside Assembly class window.  We all went to House of
Pies.  Me Molly Jodi Jeanine.  Laura did not go (she was at work)</p>

<p><p>Today I went to mom&rsquo;s church rummage sale and got an ans machine
and telephone and 3 plates and cups and my end table that I built and
2 foam matresses from our camper to use as a bed.  I also got two wall
pictures, one original signed by Picasso(!) And a sketch of Houston
skyline, 1980.  Cool.  Later</p>

<p class=date>Tuesday March 3rd, 1992</p>

<p><p>After work yesterday, I went straight out to the dorms and dropped
off my clothes and books and went to work on the VAX.  I got a lot
done on my program.  Molly came out at about 11PM or so and we joked
around some while we worked.  Then Marcel came by and said that he,
Maggie &amp; John were going to study in Agnes Arnold room 208.  So Molly
and I printed out our stuff and then joined them up there.  I had been
up since 6:45AM after staying out till 1AM at House of Pies Sunday
night, so at about 1AM at Agnes Arnold 208, I was conking out sleepy.
In order to wake me up, Maggie had me walk with her to social work
building to get her printout.  When we got back Marcel gave us some
code that we needed to do our program.  It was the actual code to
convert numbers into Hexadecimal equivalents.  At about 2:30AM, we
left to go back to the dorms.  Molly and I went to her room, and I
hopped in bed with Laura.  Molly went to OB (Oberholtzer Hall) to
study for the assembly test we had today.  I conked out immediately,
and Molly was up until about 4 or 4:30AM.  We woke up at 7:30 to
shower and eat and take our assembly test.  After the test, we went
down to the VAX and worked on the programs. I got mine working, with
the help of Marcel&rsquo;s code.  We went back to the dorms for a while
before physics.  I conked out for 30 minutes on Laura&rsquo;s bed with her.
Maggie came back down from her room and got me up just before class.
We got there &ldquo;fashionably late&rdquo; as usual.  During class, Maggie kept
writing on my paper how long we had been there: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only been 15
minutes&rdquo; or &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only 2:o&rsquo;clock&rdquo; Pretty funny.  After class, we went
back to the VAX until 5:PM when Laura sent us a message that she was
leaving for work at 5:30 and would like to see me before then.  So we
went back to the dorms.  Maggie hugged and kissed on John.  I hugged
and kissed on Laura.  Laura gave me her board card so that I could eat
dinner while she worked.  I went to dinner and sat with Carl (Calc II,
recycling) and Louis (David (Data structures)&rsquo;s twin, Physics III).
We ate and talked for about an hour.  Then I went back to Laura&rsquo;s room
and called Tammy to tell her that I think I have a VD.  (How&rsquo;s
<em>that</em> for a subject change?)  I asked if she wanted to talk
tonight and she said Yes.  I went back out to the VAX at 7PM to meet
Maggie after her Data Structures to help her on her Assembly program.
We got it working except for one little detail.  We had an
instruction: AddL2 #30, R5.  This is supposed to add thirty to the
value in R5.  R5 was 331h. The result was 68Fh or something uncool
like that.  We tried replacing R5 with R8, but got the same result.
It sucked.  The instruction only had to be executed once, and the
value (happily) was always the same, so we did MovL #775, R5
instead. It worked perfectly.  So I left Maggie at that point, hoping
she could figure it out by trying different things.  I told her if she
couldn&rsquo;t get it to work, just leave it as a MovL instruction.</p>

<p><p>As I left, Danielle requested and pleaded that I help her with her
program.  I would have loved to, but I had to come talk with Tammy.
So I get home, and she&rsquo;s on the fucking phone.  She was on the fucking
phone for 2 FUCKING hours.  What a damn waste of my time.  I could not
believe it.  I could have secured eternal gratitude from Danielle.
But now Danielle will be mad at me.  Finally Tammy got off the phone
and I showed her the evidence that I have a VD.  If it is, I
definately got it from her via her friends in Colorado.  So we talked
for about 30 minutes and Lynn called.  Shit.  now Tammy has been
fucking talking to Lynn for 30 minutes. I&rsquo;ll be glad when Tammy is
gone.</p>

<p class=date>Saturday, February 29, 1992 (Leap Day)</p>

<p><p>My new phone number will be 522-7280 starting by 5 pm March 6,
1992.  Today at work (Kroger), Alan asked if I would be interested in
going out with someone that worked with us.  I asked who and he said
Cheryl.  Cheryl has a nice smile and seems pretty fun and flirtatious,
so I said, &ldquo;sure. have her ask me.&rdquo;  He came back a bit later and said
she was too embarassed and that I would have to ask her.  So I hung
around with her during her break after I got off work and we exchanged
phone numbers.  I&rsquo;ll probably call her as soon as Tammy leaves here
tonight.  Cheryl is 19 or 20 I think.  I intend to tell her straight
out and up front what I&rsquo;m like.  I do not want commitment or anything.
I&rsquo;m not a guy to spend lots of cash on a girl, but I will show her a
good time.</p>

<p><p>Spencer is in heat and rawwling it through the whole house.</p>

<p><p>I talked to Bruce (property manager) today, and he said I can just
pay $350 tomorrow since Tammy is moving out.  Cool out.</p>

<p><p>And the ultimate: Laura and Jodi need a place to stay during the
summer!  Oh my gosh that would be so cool.  I am really interested in
kissing Jodi.  We&rsquo;ll see what happens.  Jodi said jokingly I&rsquo;ll have
to give her a back massage every night if she moves in with me.  I was
like &ldquo;Ok!  No prob.&rdquo;  That would be excellent to have them here.</p>

<p class=date>Wednesday, February 26, 1992</p>

<p><p>Tammy is moving out a week from tomorrow.  Right now I&rsquo;m backing up
the hard drive so I&rsquo;ll have a copy of all the software.  I&rsquo;m going to
have to take the computer apart and reconfigure the drives and stuff.
I intend to keep this case and LED display with the speaker switch.
Tammy is taking the huge 143 meg hard drive and the 286 mother board.
I&rsquo;m getting the sound blaster and the 360k floppy and the XT
motherboard.  (C Drive backup is done)</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m going to get at least a 386 when I upgrade.  I&rsquo;ll be glad to
have Tammy out of here.  No more of her laundry or her crap all around
the house.  I still need to call and transfer the utilities into my
name.  I think I&rsquo;ll do that now.  Dude.  I just now did the electric
and gas.  No problem.  I simply need for dad to cosign for the
electric by March 4.  She&rsquo;s moving March 5th.</p>

<p><p>WAYNE&rsquo;S WORLD!! PARTYTIME!! EXCELLENT!!  I just finished the D
drive backup. I&rsquo;m going to shower and go to school now.  Dude.  I&rsquo;m
going to get rid of the fish and put Mickey in the huge tank!  All
right!  Later.  Love Rob</p>

<p class=date>Thursday, February 21, 1992 11:59PM</p>

<p><p>Today 3 things:</p>

<p><ol>
<li><p>During physics I wrote a little note for Maggie.  I said, &ldquo;I
want to take you to Enchanted Rock and walk around and everything.&rdquo;
(I wanted to put &lsquo;and make out&rsquo; instead of &ldquo;and everything,&rdquo; but I
didn&rsquo;t.)  She wrote back, &ldquo;What brings this on?&rdquo;  I said, &ldquo;Honestly
and bluntly, and I know there&rsquo;s nothing you can or want to do about
it, but I&rsquo;m jealous of John.&rdquo; (John her boyfriend) She wrote back, &ldquo;I
think we need to talk about this.&rdquo;  We didn&rsquo;t get a chance to, but we
will someday.</p>

<p><li><p>After physics, Maggie, Heather and I went to Lynn Eusan Park,
where they had lots of stands set up with different games.  The 3 of
us competed in The Family Feud game.  I had no shoes on (as usual for
the past 2 weeks) so we called ourselves the 4 shoes.  We didn&rsquo;t win,
but it was quite fun.  The other cool thing was that I was wearing my
glasses, but it didn&rsquo;t affect anyone else.  Surprise surprise&hellip; I
still acted funny and loud and flirty and got just as many laughs,
etc. as with my contacts&hellip; Then Maggie Laura and I went to
Kroger. Then we watched the Simpsons and then Laura and I went out.</p>

<p><li><p>Laura and I were going to talk about our relationship I had
thought, but she thought we were going to talk about ourselves, so
that&rsquo;s what we did.  Oh well.  I had wanted to tell her that I don&rsquo;t
really want a big relationship with her if she&rsquo;s going to have a
negative, worrysome attitude.  I dealt with Tammy&rsquo;s similar attitude
and I don&rsquo;t want to again.</p>

<p><li><p>As I left, I met Jeanine.  We hugged and talked for a few
minutes.  We both needed a hug. Tomorrow, she&rsquo;s going to put $5.00 for
me on a horse with a 2 word, 3 syllable name.  Later</p>

<p class=date>Tuesday, February 18, 1992 9:48PM</p>

<p><p>Last night I spent at the dorms.  I went out after work to finish
up my program for assembly.  Maggie was there so I helped her with
hers.  She had about a million errors.  She and I laughed and giggled
and joked around and flirted.  It was really great.  We sent mail to
people and goofed around while writing our programs.  She finally
ditched her first one and rewrote it using only 38 lines of code.  It
worked perfectly for her.  I got mine working soon afterward and we
left to go back to the dorms.  We walked up and down the Agnes Arnold
escelators and I jumped from one to the other.  We got to her room and
Marcel, Jodi, Laura, Will, Steve, Molly, and Danielle were there.
Marcel had brought PB&amp;Jelly and we made sandwiches.  Then everyone
left and Mags &amp; I worked on Physics until we got too darn tired to do
anymore. (One of the funny things we did at the VAX (computer) was
make a file called Timewaster that was precisely one of the physics
problems.  The problem was harder than shit.  We sent the file to
Steve and Jerry as a mail message) After that, I went down to Laura&rsquo;s
room and asked if I could spend the night.  I could, of course, so I
did.  During the middle of the night, Laura started rubbing on me and
got me erect and ended up grinding on me.  I did not finger her and
did only limited breast rubbing.</p>

<p><p>In the morning, Laura gave me her board card so I could eat
breakfast.  Me, Maggie and Molly ate together before class.  Then I
took Laura&rsquo;s board card back and left my shoes and got my books.  I
haven&rsquo;t worn shoes to class in almost 2 weeks. It&rsquo;s been at least 9
school days.  Assembly class was ok.  We turned our programs in and
then I went to the lab with Danielle to help her with her program.  We
went back to the lecture.  During lecture I wrote to Danielle, &ldquo;How&rsquo;s
your lipstick today?&rdquo;  She said, &ldquo;Nice and Moist.&rdquo;  Mmmm that sounds
nice.  After class Maggie &amp; I went back to the dorms.  She went to
lunch and I worked on Physics.  We went to Physics, during which I
started to fall asleep, and then Maggie &amp; I went to the library to
copy the physics homework.  In the library there was a yellow line on
the floor which we followed to a book sale.  All kinds of books,
including some weird ones.  There was an entire 20 (TWENTY!) Volume
set of <em>United States Marine and Naval People of Ohio
1917-1918</em> for $2.00.  Holy shit.  The entire thing was nothing
but names, serial numbers, and military career descriptions of
thousands and thousands of people.  I could not believe such a
compilation of information exists!  Therefore there&rsquo;s a set for Texas,
Alabama, Hawaii, etc for 1918, 1919, 1920, 1921&hellip;  Oh my gosh!!! That
was amazing.</p>

<p><p>On the way back to the dorms, we saw Marcel and Steve lounging by
the water fountain where rocks spew water.  By Ezeikiel Cullen and the
Student Service building.  We played around there for a while and then
went in.  Maggie went to dinner at 4:30 and I went downstairs to
Laura&rsquo;s.  I played with her and read some assembly.  Then she left for
the spades tournament.  I called Fred since he&rsquo;s leaving today for
France with the Texas T(rom)-bones.  Cool.  I talked to him for a bit
and we decided to get has ass out here for a weekend soon.  That will
be cool.  He has a VW bug now, so he can drive himself.  Cool.  Then I
came home and filled out scholarship stuff.  I&rsquo;m going to pay $45.00
to a company who will match me with some companies who are likely to
give me scholarships.  And the 45 bucks will be refunded if I don&rsquo;t
get at least $100 dollars.  Cool.</p>

<p><p>Then Tammy came home and we were talking and she said, &ldquo;What if I
were to move out?&rdquo; (she said she has thought about doing that in an
attempt to &ldquo;get me back&rdquo; for whatever)</p>

<p><p>I said bluntly that I&rsquo;d be fine if she moved out, in fact, great if
she moved out.  The house would be clean, I wouldn&rsquo;t have her laundry.
The bills would be cut in <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>, etc.  The discussion reached the point
of Tammy could be replaced by a dog and 2 bean bags.  She was kinda
upset by this and I had to comfort her and tell her she was of course
welcome to stay.</p>

<p><p>We all saw <em>Wayne&rsquo;s World</em> at Meyer Park 14 recently.
Marcel and I <em>ran</em> around the parking lot, racing to and from
the car to get the frisbee, we played frisbee beside the theater, we
had fun.  Movie lines.  Garth: &ldquo;Hey man, what if he honks in my car?&rdquo;
Wayne: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m giving you a no honk guarantee.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Hey Phil, if you spew,
spew into this (dixie cup).&rdquo; Wayne speaking 5 syllables of Catonese
after spending one night learning it = several lines of complex not
usual English captions.  That was great.  Garth falling out of his
chair at the sight of the beautiful girl.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have cream of
someyoungguy.&rdquo; Terminator II&rsquo;s Robert Patrick character pulling Wayne
over.  Scooby-Doo ending, happy ending, etc. ending.  That&rsquo;s about it.
Later</p>
