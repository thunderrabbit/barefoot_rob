<p>After super yoga and delicious lunch yesterday at Paola&rsquo;s, Lin and I ate delicious dinner at Thom and Kathryn&rsquo;s place, featuring Dominic and Rodrigo who are back in Japan for a visit.</p>

<p>We ate, stayed up late, woke up late, had fruit smoothies, then joined the dogs for a walk in Yoyogi Park.</p>

<p>I found a fiverr gig that got lots of rave reviews.  Ashley <a href="https://fiverr.com/tn5rr2012/trace-your-family-tree-for-you-and-go-back-4-generations">will start your family tree for you and go back 4 generations for $5</a>. I don&rsquo;t know who Ashely is, but she had great reviews, so I sent her $10, my grandparents names on both sides of my family, and she got to work.  For an extra $10 per search, she&rsquo;ll send all the images and sources she finds during the process.</p>

<p>My lovely dear <a href="https://laura.chinet.com/oldindex.html">Laura Wallace</a> helped me get started with genealogy (with <a href="https://www.whollygenes.com">The Master Genealogist</a>  (TMG)) back in the day.  That software is only available for Windows, so I recently installed an ISO of windows XP in <a href="https://virtualbox.org">Virtual Box</a>, loaded a 30 day trial of TMG and updated my 10+ year old data to the new TMG format.</p>

<p>I was thinking of just using TMG in the Windows window of my Mac, but searched around and found two (of many!) Mac options that I considered using.  The first was Family Tree Maker by ancestry.com.  I was just about to buy (into its) advertising, when I decided to do a bit more digging.  It seems that ancestry.com is the Blob that Ate Free Genealogy sites, with its many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestry.com#Other_sites">acquisitions of formerly free services</a>.</p>

<p>Then I found <a href="https://familysearch.org">Family Search</a>, which is free!  There&rsquo;s a Mac version of <a href="https://www.ohanasoftware.com">FamilyInsight by Ohana Software</a>, which costs $25 (per year I think), but even if it&rsquo;s per year, it&rsquo;s 1/10th the price of ancestry.com&rsquo;s option.</p>

<p>Apparently ancestry.com has a huge database of names and sources, but I think I&rsquo;ll be quite fine for a while on familysearch.org.</p>

<p>Lin was typing a password or something into a computer, but it
    kept rejecting what she typed.  I noticed that she hadn&rsquo;t read
    all the instructions at the top of the page so I told her to
    read them first.  She kept typing the same (wrong) thing and
    was getting more and more frustrated that it wasn&rsquo;t working.  I
    kept getting more and more frustrated that she wasn&rsquo;t listening
    to me.  I yelled at her, slid my hands across all the keys to
    write crap data into the password field, all just to get her
    attention.</p>

<pre><code>The waiter next to us was surprised, and I said &quot;I'm sorry; I 
have an issue of getting super angry if people don't listen to 
me; it's not her fault but I take it out on her.

I started to do some kind of self-healing to release the anger, 
and during that process, I woke up,
</code></pre>

<p>I woke up realizing that I can do a bit better and be less angry if Lin misunderstands or otherwise seems to not listen to me.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I haven&rsquo;t written a SoML in a while.</p></li>

<li><p>Fred and Ma are coming to Japan in December!!</p></li>

<li><p>Lin and I have been going to yoga class every Saturday morning at <a href="https://yogasan.net">Yogasan</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve been working at sbstrm for going on 3 years now, not counting my Thailand adventure and chilling in Chigasaki.</p></li>

<li><p>My long-running project at sbstrm is for AB, for whom Lin used to work.</p></li>

<li><p>Most recently been working on A4F&rsquo;s new site, rebuilding their wordpress site with the latest iteration of our custom framework.</p></li>

<li><p>After work, I&rsquo;ve been working with Tariq on iPhone development.  We have three apps out at this time: Mike&rsquo;s English outside Japan, and 楽しい英語, and 読み書き英語 available in Japan.  They are not free apps, and I think that may have been a mistake. Might make them free and have in-app purchases for goodies in the apps.</p></li>

<li><p>Most recently been working on a 2D game app using Cocos2D and Box2D.  I&rsquo;ve been looking at the option of using Sparrow and Chipmunk as well, though Chipmunk doesn&rsquo;t yet support iOS 6.0 due to some bugs in XCode compilers or something.</p></li>

<li><p>So right <em>now</em>, while I&rsquo;m typing, my computer is downloading XCode 4.3.3 so I can get a copy of iphoneos5.1.sdk so I can evaluate Chipmunk.</p></li>

<li><p>My computer is new since my last SoML.  It&rsquo;s a Macbook Pro, with retina display, 256Gig SSD drive, and 16 GB of RAM.  It&rsquo;s not as fast as it should be, though it is faster than my previous machine.  Sometimes Finder just locks up and loses its mind for 20 seconds and then starts working again.  Why?</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;m running OS X 10.7.5 (&ldquo;Lion&rdquo;) because I still haven&rsquo;t received my &ldquo;upgrade&rdquo; code to Mountain Lion.</p></li>

<li><p>For iPhone dev purposes, I got an iPhone 5.  Its name is Johnny Five, named after the character in Short Circuit.  For AU evaluation purposes (plus they allow tethering (feeding WiFi to local devices from my phone via its cellular service)), I&rsquo;m using AU instead of Softbank.  Interesting tidbit: it took me about 1 day to get my iPhone 5 after they were released.   Lin ordered hers through softbank (on the same day as I ordered mine through AU), and didn&rsquo;t get a call from them for a couple weeks, during which time she was like, &ldquo;bah&rdquo; and told them they can keep their phone when they said it was finally available. </p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve still got my iPhone4S for everyday use.  Its name is Little Blue Monkey, because when I first got it, I had a blue case for it.</p></li>

<li><p>I recently wrote a Wordpress plugin to create bingo cards, but haven&rsquo;t polished it nor a site to run it.</p></li>

<li><p>Due to all this coding, I haven&rsquo;t drawn any mazes recently, though I did get a maze request via <a href="https://fiverr.com/thunderrabbit">Fiverr</a> recently.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve been reading A Course In Miracles; I&rsquo;m about this far through the book which is THIS thick.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven&rsquo;t played Minecraft in about a week.</p></li>

<li><p>Recently Andrew and I received the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009PM82UE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B009PM82UE&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=keepusthelim-20">Elevation Docks</a> we ordered a long time ago.  They&rsquo;re quite nice.  I got limited edition green one; he got orange.  We also each got a <del>silver</del> brushed aluminum and black one.  Lin got my silver one, and the black one is on my desk at work.</p></li>

<p>Sitting with two of Andy&rsquo;s long-time friends, I got to hear how he became associated with the Pink Cow.   He had been working in a bar serving beer when a guy noticed how precisely Andy served the beers, taking great care that each one was optimally poured with a perfect foamy head that just crested the top of the mug. The guy asked Andy if he could mix drinks as well.  Andy was like, &ldquo;I can mix any drink you can name.&rdquo;  The guy named a few drinks and Andy mixed them perfectly, better than the guy had ever previously tasted.  Could Andy cook?  Absolutely; it turns out that Andy&rsquo;s hands have a different DNA than the rest of his body; his hands themselves know how to prepare any dish ever prepared or ever desired.&mdash;-</p>

<p>Why was I dreaming about Andy at <a href="https://www.thepinkcow.com">The Pink Cow</a>?  I guess it&rsquo;s time to go back and check out the new location again!!</p>

<p>I know <a href="https://www.elearnenglishlanguage.com/difficulties/youryoure.html">how to spell your and you&rsquo;re</a>.</p>

<p>I often see things like &ldquo;your stupid&rdquo; or &ldquo;stay in you&rsquo;re mom&rsquo;s basement&rdquo; in stupid comment battles.  Each time, I wonder if I can think of a sentence where either word could be used while keeping the sentence grammatically correct.</p>

<p>This is quickly foiled by a large difference in the grammatical usage of the words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your&rdquo; is your basic possessive pronoun.  Use &ldquo;you&rsquo;re&rdquo; and you&rsquo;re using a pronoun and a verb.</p>

<p>I imagine this difference can be overcome with careful use of <a href="https://www.enchantedlearning.com/wordlist/nounandverb.shtml">words which can be considered nouns or verbs</a>, depending on their usage.  However you&rsquo;re still pretty much left with</p>

<p>Your NOUN</p>

<ul>
<li><p>your dog</p></li>

<li><p>your cat</p></li>

<li><p>your mama</p></li>
</ul>

<p>OR</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re VERBING</p>

<ul>
<li><p>you&rsquo;re dancing</p></li>

<li><p>you&rsquo;re eating</p></li>

<li><p>you&rsquo;re yelling</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You&rsquo;re VERBED (actually I&rsquo;m not sure what these are)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>you&rsquo;re screwed</p></li>

<li><p>you&rsquo;re tired</p></li>

<li><p>you&rsquo;re required</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You&rsquo;re ADJECTIVE</p>

<ul>
<li><p>you&rsquo;re smart</p></li>

<li><p>you&rsquo;re sexy</p></li>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a struggle, but if we keep this up, I can only imagine it will get easier, and I&rsquo;ll look back and think, &ldquo;man, what was I thinking??&rdquo;</p>

<p>Right now, we&rsquo;ve got three apps in the app store:  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mikes-english/id553151517?mt=8&amp;uo=4">Mike&rsquo;s English</a> available outside Japan, and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/jp/app/leshii-ying-yu/id558509841?mt=8&amp;uo=4">楽しい英語</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/jp/app/dumi-shuki-ying-yu/id550411320?mt=8&amp;uo=4">読み書き英語</a> inside Japan.  The apps are similar, but the ones in Japan contain a bit of Japanese content, and are geared more towards Tariq&rsquo;s book, which is not yet available in the US.</p>

<p>Anyway, as I was preparing to upload the new versions, I noted that our little list of apps is slowly growing.  Decided to take a baby photo of our app collection.</p>

<p>Time to harass Chase again for their crappy password policies.  I asked them why they only allow 32 character passwords.  &ldquo;Are you storing them in plaintext?&rdquo;  And why don&rsquo;t they allow special characters in my password?  &ldquo;Are you afraid of SQL injection?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="https://getfile5.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2012-09-07/jBvclFotrcBbyIdHfBkhGFBBFEfbDCEHbdDEgudaFIuEEsqcBEFhBIAACjsp/chase_short_easy_passwords.png.scaled1000.png"><img src="https://getfile2.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2012-09-07/jBvclFotrcBbyIdHfBkhGFBBFEfbDCEHbdDEgudaFIuEEsqcBEFhBIAACjsp/chase_short_easy_passwords.png.scaled500.png" alt="Chase_short_easy_passwords" /></a></p>

<p>Their reply included this gem.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As a security measure, we do not include special characters for user ids and passwords.&rdquo;</p>

<p>WTF?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure where to start, but I think I&rsquo;ll start looking for another bank.  Maybe a credit union or something will have everything I need, and far fewer fees.  Chase has been siphoning $12 PER MONTH so that I can have my money in their account.</p>
