<p>Just finished teaching and am now seated on a balcony walkway thing
overlooking the empty water fountain in middle of Solid Square.</p>

<p>The lesson featured drills on two different patterns.  One student was like &ldquo;I went
to shopping&rdquo; so we practiced variants of that pattern.  Another
student arrived and started talking about TV so we practiced a pattern
like</p>

<p>______ is a _______ about _______ _____-ing ______ ____ __  _ _  _ _</p>

<p>and eventually made a game:</p>

<pre><code>This is a TV show about young adults living together in Hawaii.
</code></pre>

<p>Chika got it immediately: &ldquo;Terrace House&rdquo;</p>

<p>After 3 rounds, Chika ended up with 3 points vs everyone else having 0
points.</p>

<p>Tokyo Men&rsquo;s Circle had 6 participants including a new man last night.
He said he plans to attend the co-gender group next week.  We talked
about ways to serve the community even more, possibly offering
team-building workshops to businesses.</p>

<p>I am on the train now in Shinjuku.  How is it they have more
super-express trains that express trains?  I guess they know what they
are doing and it works out for me, so there&rsquo;s my answer.</p>

<p>Anyway, I texted CB 44 minutes after our normal meeting time.</p>

<pre><code>[6/19/17, 1:44:12 PM] me: Do you want to have a meeting today?
[6/19/17, 2:25:36 PM] CB: I am so sorry, we don't really have any task right now.
[6/19/17, 2:26:09 PM] CB: I should've told you early.
[6/19/17, 2:33:56 PM] me: Okay no problem.
[6/19/17, 2:34:27 PM] me: Let me know if you have any questions during the week
[6/19/17, 2:34:53 PM] CB: Ok, thank you!
[6/19/17, 2:36:34 PM] me: I am going to work from home then, so Skype me if you need anything.
[6/19/17, 2:36:40 PM] me: have a great week!

<li>I completed 40 frames of animation yesterday with new camera and
trial version of DragonFrame.  I think I will buy a license for
it.  One big question at this point is how to handle N*10^6 images
in the final project.</li>
<li>I am currently headed to SOGO (Suns Out Guns Out) an exercise group
I joined late last year, like in September I guess.  I only go on
Sundays, but there are other activities people do every day of the
week.  I am most interested in rock climbing, but I teach Sarumama
on Mondays when the rock climbing group meets.</li>
<li>I started messing around with Mailchimp again to set up reminders
before meetings, but have not completed it yet.. They do not have a
way to send out mails every 1st and 3rd Tuesday, which is what I
want.  I got messages to send via their API, but have not connected
it to cron yet on my server.  So close; why did I not finish?  I am
an expert at not finishing projects.</li>
<li>I plan to meet Tariq today after SOGO.  We want to upgrade our iOS
apps to latest and &ldquo;greatest&rdquo; version of iOS and XCode, the
steaming pile of okay well I have not used XCode 9 yet, but I
assume it will be just as annoying as always.</li>
<li>Interesting to think about how I like to take pictures of
construction over time, I am doing a stop action animation project,
and I am planning to write (in reverse) a
<del>book</del><ins>story</ins> within commit messages of these
journal entries.  This is the first time I have mentioned it in the
content of my journal and not the commit messages.  All of these
seem like stop motion animation to me. I must be fascinated with
changes over time or something.</li>
<li>Lin wants to buy a new mattress and to clean my room.  Cleaning my
room took priority over the mattress, so I am curious as to how

<p>Today is the big day to move CB to new servers.  I reset the master
password after it became apparent that the normal user cannot dump the
DB.  CB was still not able to run mysqldump, so they ended up just
getting a snapshot from their AWS RDS instance.</p>

<p>I hope hope hope hope the transition goes smoothly.  Today I have been
giving some advice but not actually <em>doing</em> anything (except reset the
master password) because I have not been made privy as to what exactly
they want to do with the data.  Curiously enough, I will be glad when
I no longer get requests to support CB changes.  I hope hope hope
their new sysadmins can interpret their requests more easily, and
explain why certain things are not doable.</p>

<p>Just finished going through the CB admin site and the CB staging site
to look for any differences.  I see some cases where functionality
does not work, but both sites produce the same results, even in those
non-working cases.</p>

<p>Right now they are in a meeting and I feel fear because I cannot
anticipate if they are going to be pissed because they think I did not
follow their unwritten expectations or if they will say yeah nothing
to do see you next week.</p>

<h2 id="yesterday">Yesterday</h2>

<p>(written 17:38 Sunday 11 June 2017 JST)</p>

<p>Yesterday Simon and I had a great time walking from Harajuku to Tokyo
Tower.</p>

<p>We caught a ride with Lin on her way to work, and saw an interesting
accident underneath 246.</p>

<p><a href="//b.robnugen.com/peeps/simon/2017_walked_from_harajuku_to_tokyo_tower/060_accident.jpg"><img src="//b.robnugen.com/peeps/simon/2017_walked_from_harajuku_to_tokyo_tower/thumbs/060_accident.jpg" alt="accident under 246" /></a></p>

<p>We walked for a bit on takeshita street, before it got crowded</p>

<p><a href="//b.robnugen.com/peeps/simon/2017_walked_from_harajuku_to_tokyo_tower/070_funny_pic_of_simon_in_Harajuku.jpg"><img src="//b.robnugen.com/peeps/simon/2017_walked_from_harajuku_to_tokyo_tower/thumbs/070_funny_pic_of_simon_in_Harajuku.jpg" alt="070 funny pic of simon in Harajuku" /></a>

<p>then went to Yoyogi park.</p>

<p>He said Yoyogi park was great, and they have nothing like it in
Osaka. Near the front of the park, we saw some people doing a
religious ceremony near some trees. It was as if each person were
singing to his or her own tree, but they were all singing in like a
round with one guy kind of leading the charge.  He was wearing formal
religious attire whereas the rest of people were just wearing regular
street clothes.</p>

<p><a href="//b.robnugen.com/peeps/simon/2017_walked_from_harajuku_to_tokyo_tower/085_simon_near_tree_singers.jpg"><img src="//b.robnugen.com/peeps/simon/2017_walked_from_harajuku_to_tokyo_tower/thumbs/085_simon_near_tree_singers.jpg" alt="085 simon near tree singers" /></a></p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/p8BvQe0Dk_U">https://youtu.be/p8BvQe0Dk_U</a></p>

<p>We walked around the fountains after that, and then I remembered I
want to show him the &ldquo;homeless&rdquo; guys with blue tarps down on the west
side of the park. We walked that direction and I discovered a new
bridge out of the park which I hadn&rsquo;t seen before and a monolithic
statue or something that looks like a giant tomb with an 3rd Reich
style eagle on it, and Japanese text I have not yet gotten translated.</p>

<p>Once we got to the homeless guys, Simon was duly impressed with their
homes, especially the one guy who apparently does paintings in is his
home, which looks a lot like a greenhouse.</p>

<p>Got a nice picture of us at the fountains in Yoyogi, and then decided
to head toward Shibuya.  We walked across the old bridge, which was
new to me, and goes to a set of sports fields from a high school, I
think. We walked briefly pass the Vietnamese festival, and then headed
down the walkway next NHK, and turned right once we got into the back
streets of Shibuya.</p>

<p>Walked to Roppongi to go to The Pink Cow, but they open at 5pm each
day.  Simon wanted to go to Tokyo Tower.</p>

<p>Walked to the tower and had fun talking to two peeps we met in costume
for Tokyo One Piece.  Did not get pictures, but they were
entertaining.</p>

<p>I would like to send an email reminder every 1st and 3rd Tuesday.
Doesn&rsquo;t look like it&rsquo;s possible with basic Mailchimp interface.  I
might be able to use their API to do it.</p>

<p>Ah nice.  They can do monthly campaigns, so I can just set up two
campaigns.  Their help support team sent me screenshots and great
detail on how to set it up.  Nice work, Mailchimp!</p>
