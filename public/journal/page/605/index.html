<p><p>Yesterday and today I installed the NAIC accounting software for our investment club and went through the two tutorial things.   Today I entered all our investment club numbers in the software (started over for the 3rd and hopefully final time) and it was so easy!  I&rsquo;m quite thankful to be using the software.</p>

<p><p>Since I&rsquo;ll be at Youth Council during the next meeting, my next task is to write up directions so someone else can cover my job at the next investment club meeting.  I don&rsquo;t trust that the assistant treasurer will be there; she lives in South Carolina now I think.</p>

<p><p>Yesterday Wende and I saw <em>Nutty Professor II The Klumps</em>  It was as funny as the first one, but had fewer outtakes at the end of the show.  I really enjoy the outtakes and wanted more&hellip;  Maybe they just had more on the video, but not in theaters.  I dunno.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m leaving in 5 hours for youth council.  I have
packed all my stuff, but I still want to purchase a
couple of AAA batteries for my Visor just to make sure
it doesn&rsquo;t run out of juice on me.</p>

<p><p>I hope to write lots and lots of lovely entries all
week!!  They will mostly be &ldquo;we worked on this
resolution&rdquo; and &ldquo;we brainstormed this thing&rdquo; and
boring stuff like that.  But I hope also that maybe
our Silent Football games will be well recorded&hellip;</p>

<p><p>Oh, hey - that reminds me.  One of my loyal readers
(you know who you are) asked about Silent Football.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You keep referring to Silent Football, but I can&rsquo;t
find an actual description of the rules of the
game&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Yes, yes, that is true.</p>

<p><p>I don&rsquo;t have time to write up a quick version of
the rules, but I just did a search on Alta Vista:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>This version is close, but they use elbows
instead of outstretched fists for zooms: <a
href="https://www.oberlin.edu/~cnicolai/unirondack/silent-football.html">www.oberlin.edu/~cnicolai/unirondack/silent-football.html</a>

<p><li>Here is a confused variation, presumably
described by an excited player who has not played many
games.  They also include drinking, which we do not.
<a
href="https://www2.bc.edu/~lesterk/football.html">www2.bc.edu/~lesterk/football.html</a>

<p><li>A basic description is buried on this page: <a
href="https://www.people.cornell.edu/pages/ajr25/games/">www.people.cornell.edu/pages/ajr25/games/</a>

<p><li>hahaha: search for the word "silent" on this
page: <a
href="https://prep.math.tamu.edu/Graph99/wesleyr/journal/index.html">prep.math.tamu.edu/Graph99/wesleyr/journal/index.html</a>
</ul>

<p><p>For me, the best thing about searching for &ldquo;silent football&rdquo; on the web: 4 or 5 of the 42 hits were journal entries from my geocities site.  Heheh.</p>

<p><p>Okay, I&rsquo;m going to bed.  I have to leave in 4.3 hours.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ll be back in a week!!</p>

<p><p>Last night Maggie called and I went up to her house to watch movies!  We met at Blockbuster and rented <em>The Thirteenth Floor</em> and <em>Romeo Must Die</em>.  I hadn&rsquo;t seen either and she hadn&rsquo;t seen Romeo.  They were both really cool movies; I liked 13th floor better.  Intersting to me that they both seemed to have The Matrix qualities in it.  13th floor had it conceptually and Romeo had it in effects (fighting scenes).</p>

<p><p>Wende and I just visited the arboretum looking for a sweet gum ball spikey thing.  Did not find one.  Wende says they fall between December and April.  Slightly out of season, but we didn&rsquo;t even find old half-decayed ones.</p>

<p><p>Now we&rsquo;re at Pot Pie Pizzaria munchin&rsquo; before movie (The Klumps I think)</p>

<p><p>I have just written documents that describe the state of El Project and what enhancements need to be made to it.  If these are not finished while I am gone next week, then the documents will help me get my brain back in gear remembering what&rsquo;s up.</p>

<p><p>So, yes, I&rsquo;m attending Youth Council next week!  I am not 100% looking forward to it.  The week will be a lot of fun, but also a lot of work.  I will enjoy having a week that is purely fun and vacationish, but I don&rsquo;t think it will be this week.</p>

<p><p>I will bring my Visor so I can write tons of entries and get them moved online relatively quickly when I get back.  I&rsquo;ve clearly noted that after the reunion, I didn&rsquo;t get them all online quickly.  I&rsquo;ve moved 1 so far; not even done yet.  I plan to finish today.</p>

<p><p>Before Youth Council, I want to find a little prickly ball of a sweet gum tree (I think that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s called.) Micaela, who will be at YC, thinks that I am imagining these mysterious thingies.</p>

<p><p>I also need to bring batteries for my Visor; it would suck if I lost all that I electronically capture during the week.</p>

<p><p>I just fucking got into an accident.  Stopped at stop sign and then went and then saw a truck oncoming.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m talking to insurance guy now with very dry voice as he&rsquo;s obviously reading from a script.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Was anyone hurt in the accident?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That is good.  I am glad to hear that no one was hurt in the accident.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m thankful that I don&rsquo;t have his job.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Where bjblaflafjaf vehicle?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>(I didn&rsquo;t understand what he said, but he was talking about their vehicle)</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Their right front bumper&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;But was their car totalled at the accident?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, it was not totalled.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Okay.  You said it was their right front bumper that was damaged?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>We saw <em>X-Men</em> movie last night.  If you do not want <em>any</em> details of the movie, don&rsquo;t read below.</p>

<p><p>I thought it was great.  Given the mutants&rsquo; various powers, they were all used in ways that made sense to me.</p>

<p><p>The super X-jet was pretty fly (no pun intended) apparently, though they didn&rsquo;t make it do much more than vertical take off and fly low and fast across the harbor, making the water spray up like in Firefox (1980s?  Clint Eastwood)</p>

<p><p>My favorite line- after Mystic and Wolverine were fighting, both looking exactly like Wolverine, Wolverine won the battle, giving her 3 nice puncture wounds in the stomach.  Then he rejoined the rest of the group:</p>

<p><p>Cyclops looks alarmed, not knowing if it&rsquo;s the real Wolverine.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hey hey, it&rsquo;s really me,&rdquo; assures Wolverine.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Prove it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>[pause] &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a dick.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>[nod] &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>And Wolverine rejoined the group.</p>

<p><p> That was funny.   Oh, also funny to me, making me laugh boistrously in the theater (good thing it was only 5:30 showing (but dammit, they didn&rsquo;t count it as matinee) and not many people were there):  Wolverine has just met Rogue and she encourages him to put on his seat belt.  &ldquo;Listen, missy, I don&rsquo;t need you to tell&hellip;.&rdquo;    [squeaaaaling tires crashcrash crash crash ] and he flies through the windshield.  I knew he couldn&rsquo;t be dead; the movie just started.  HAHHAhhaaaaahahahh!!</p>

<p><p>Wende was all, &ldquo;shhhh, it&rsquo;s not funny.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>(yes it was)</p>

<p><p>Then at the very very end, they&rsquo;ve got Magneto in a plastic jail.  Nice concept; it makes sense.  The cell is suspended in a large room so he metal affecting powers can&rsquo;t touch any metal.  But previously in the movie he was affecting metal further away than that (as he was crossing a chasm the metal forming his bridge came from much further away).</p>

<p><p>Great movie.  Go see it.  I&rsquo;m ranking it about 8.5 out of 10 on the overall scale.</p>

<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol>
<p><li>Erick Morrow has been killed.  He was apparently drunk and playing chicken with a car (a friend (also drunk) was driving)  one friend got out of the way of the car; Erick did not.

<p>He was a recently graduated YRUU youth.  A lot of peeps in the YRUU community are emotionally upset about it.

<p><li>I'm working on El Project - the coding is done; today we worked on getting the datasets all cleaned up.  I found no fewer than 40 repeated names and emails (similar or identical spellings) in the data they gave us.  Out of 900 correct names is that a good ratio?

<p><li>The family reunion was fun. (I've written a lot about it on my Visor) I just haven't moved the entries to my site yet.  I'm close.

<p>(17:28 just lost power for about 20 seconds. (a lot of lightning outside)  I'm thankful I was typing this on my Visor and not on computer.  Yay for smart thinking!)

<p><li>I got a pretty good amount of genealogical information from Wende's mom and (step)dad on the way home from family reunion.  Having this information makes me feel closer to the family and happier about the <em>marriage</em> and other things that might scare me.

<p><li>Oh!  I sent some pics to photoworks.com and got them back (electronically) today!  There are some of the Hazard Street bridge being built (that's the one by the tube through which I crawled) and some of me on unicycle and some funny ones of Tinkerbell inside Wende's shorts (while Wende was still in them too)

<p><li>BBST is still fun and silly!  Visit <a href="https://www.geeky-boy.com">https://www.geeky-boy.com</a> and tell us Thunder Rabbit sent you!

<p><li>Ultimate tonight if it's not raining.  Maybe not and I'll just sleep or watch a movie with Wende.
</ol>

<p>Dinner was great - Walt, our waiter was amazingly
cheerful and happy to serve the entire time.  28 or 30
people, including little kids and lots of alcohol and
testosterone running around.  

<p>Funny thing was that we were near a balcony which
overlooked a little dock thing of water two stories
below us.  The kids tossed french fries down to feed
the fish.  There was "a school of french fries"
floating in the water.  So when I brought some french
fries to join the fun, I discovered that even though
the fish had plenty floating just below us, the ducks
were available on the dock next door, so I threw
french fries to the next water lot and two stories
down to the ducks.

<p>Cindy was showing me the family tree, but didn't
get very far.

<p class=date>0:56am</p>

<p>Rodd and I stayed up for a bit talkin' about stocks
and shit, looking up a few different symbols and just
general talkin about investing.

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>Dreamt that my family had a family
reunion in the Methil house (there's  Methil  again
twice in two dreams (this time the house was
accurately placed on the street, although I never saw
the house from the outside))

<p class=dream>It was my dad's family - Becky, Barbie,
Charlie, Cordie, and some other faces that don't
actually exist (that I know of).   One woman was not
allowed to have chocolate, but she indulged herself,
mostly to get attention it seems.  She said she
forgot.

<p class=dream>Interesting thing to me: the house was
owned by Becky (dad's sister) and she had installed an
electric eye thing that would recognize when someone
walked in the door.  This device would turn on the
ceiling fan in the living room to help make the
environment more comfortable when people were in
there.

<p><p>After waking up, we packed and went home.  I rode
with Wende&rsquo;s parents and got lots of genealogical
information.  I felt closer to the family after that.</p>

                        <p class=date>7:48am Saturday 29 July 2000</p>

<p>Last night Wende showed me the SWUUSI mugbook.  I
enjoyed looking at all the youths' pictures and quotes
and stuff..  She had made a mailbag for me, and I got
4 notes from people.  Two notes from Sean, who
expressed sadness that Bryn is leaving for a year for
Australia.  

<p>He had written me email before, but I didn't
respond; I diidn't recognize that he was reaching out
to me.  But I have composed a little letter to him on
my Visor here which I will send when I get back to
work on Monday.

<p>Wende and I moved the bed matress off the frame to
the floor of the loft.  The frame only had 3 slats
supporting the matress. Even though the matress is
thick, we were still falling through the slats in a
most uncomfortable manner.

<p>Wende is stil trying to sleep amidst the kitchen
noises.  So nice to cuddle with her again.  Although I
find it interesting that immediately I am drawn to
spending more time in bed beside her just 'doing
nothing' and that feels desperate or something.  I
dunno.

<p>I'm getting up.

<p>Oh, there is a cop car parked by the main road,
visible from our window here.  I saw hm spin his
lights on and presumably snag someone last night. 
Actually two cars sped away with lights flashing.  I
guess the other one is hidden behnd the building.


<p class=date>9:44am</p>

<p>Traded stories in the kitchen with Gary and Margot
"Aunt Margot and Gary" about trucks and work and me
jumping my dad's truck over the rail road tracks.


<p class=date>15:10</p>

<p>Beach was great fun.  I started with a boogeyboard
along with Erika and her boogie board.  (Actually I
think I had hers and she had her brother's)

<p>Then I monitored Erika and Julie on the
boogerboards for a while.  We found itty bitty little
clear crabs on floating seaweed things.  that was
pretty cool.

<p>Then I began digging a hole on the beach.  The kids
alternately helped dig, put sand in the hole, build a
wall around the hole.  I dug deep enough that I
discovered a layer of little shells which stabbed my
fingertips.  With the help of a small shovel and a
sieve, I filtered a couple of pounds of shells out of
the sand.

<p>I buried my legs up to my knees and basically sat
on the beach in a slightly meditative state while the
kids scrambled randomly about.  (There were plenty of
other adults around)

<p>Lee was most intrigued by the shells and demanded
that I show her how to do it.  She would grab sand
from the surface and sieve it only to find nothing. 
She pressed the sieve down into the sandy water to
discover still nothing.   I explained the concept of
the shells in the sand but that such sand was down
under my feet.

<p>"Then get your feet out."

<p>A few different times, I explained that I chose not
to take them out now.   I was sure to call her over
when I was ready to get up.

<p>I got out after a couple of minutes without too
much trouble.  Then we dug and dug and dug looking for
more shells.  Before we found any, she announced,
"we're done" and scampered over to where some of the
other girls had buried themselves.

<p>Soon it was time for lunch.  Washed off in the
ocean and now we just ate.  (Wende and her sister
Stacy and their 1/2 sister Julie and I are all at the
beach house rented by Margot and Gary.  The rest of
the gang is at Allison and Mark's beach house.)

<p>Nap time.

<p class=date>18:52</p>

<p>I fell deeply asleep after lunch.  I remember Wende
giving me a kiss as she took my wallet to go shopping
with her mom.   That was easily a couple hours ago and
they're not back yet.   Stacy and Rodd were sleepin'
until just recently.  Margot and Gary are fighting for
some reason.  Seems to me that Margot is willingly
taking the verbal abuse and emotional cold shoulder
(I've never used that term before), trying to act and
look like everything is fine, going back out to the
patio to where Gary is.  That's her choice; I will
have more insight later.

<p><p class=note>(I&rsquo;m at the dinner table now, typing on
my Visor in my lap)</p>

<p><p>Dinner after lots of pictures..  and I drew a
picture on the back of the menu for Nannie. and Cindy
asked for a big 6 foot by 4 foot picture/image of same
style but certain colors which Wende will pick out.</p>

<p>just as I was on the sleeping side of the awake/asleep line, The phone rang.  Loren (sp) (female) was callling to verify that I still wanted to fuck with the router tonight.  (that's not the term she used)

<p>They are <em>still</em> on hold with Northpoint.  Seems to me like they should have a hotline super connect number to reach them.

<p>I was flip floppin around in bed for 40 minutes before I got to sleep, including a few close calls to sleep but awakened by air conditioner coming on or cats squeaking somewhere or something.

<p>Loren said that hopefully they would be on with Northpoint soon.  I'm going to either sleep or write a letter.  

<p>I feel helpless here..  I want to sleep, but I'm not particularly tired.  maybe that's my answer.  I'm not tired so stay up and do something.

<p>---

<p class=date>00:29 Friday 28 July 2000</p>

<p>I was talking to Spot and Tinkerbell on the bathroom counter, wondering if Tinkerbell will ever quit randomly chasing Spot around or if Spot will ever get a backbone and swat the snot out of her when the phone rang.

<p>It was Wende!!!!  She said the Bridging Ceremony was lovely and she, Arlene and Debe all just stood in the back and cried "as if all our kids were getting married."  Can you believe it? : Nancypants, Oliver, Shira, Elizabeth, ... all graduating!!  They will actually attend rallies for one more year and then attend the bridging ceremony at GA and that will be it.  So actually we will still see them for a year at rallies.

<p class=date>00:33 Friday 28 July 2000</p>

<p><p>No call from Savvis yet.  I hate to call them back and say &ldquo;forget it; I&rsquo;m going to bed&rdquo;  They&rsquo;ve been on hold with them for 1.5 hours now.  Not like on hold, crick in the neck from cradling the phone&hellip; but still.  I dunno if the hold time would be relatively shorter if we tried again in the morning.   But in the morning I know I will be even antsier (ancier?) to go work on Java at work and stuff.</p>

<p><p>I think I&rsquo;ll sweep the floors now.</p>
