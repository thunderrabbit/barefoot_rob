<p>Oh my gosh.</p>

<p>I got a card in the mail and I assumed it was a "hey, jack, you got
a package; come pick it up at the post office."</p>

<p>I went to the post office and then I noted that there was postage
on the card; such a notice (come get your shiznit) wouldn't have
postage on it.</p>

<p>So before I got to the front of the line at the post office, I aborted 
my mission and went to see Koko.</p>

<p>I showed her the card, Ç±ÇÍÅÌÇ»ÇÒÇ≈Ç©? I asked her.</p>

<p>She looked and then gasped a bit.  "Ç≥Ç¢Å”!  they found your wallet.
It's at the police station in ÇµÇ»Ç™ÅÌ."</p>

<p>Wow wowowowowowoww.  I've been carrying this notice around in my
new wallet for some days now (since 2 May, I think), waiting for a
moment that I (A) had time, (B) had a working bicycle.</p>

<p>Whoooohoooooooo!!!!!!!!!!  AND fortunately, I have until 15 May
to pick it up before they ... archive it or something making it a more
challenging process to recover.</p>

<p>Past that I think she said I have 6 months to pick it up.</p>

<p>Oh, Japan, my faith in you is restored.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>nevermind</p>

<p class=date>1:48pm</p>

<p>I have been sitting outside the police station for five minutes,
meditatively reconciling my old stuff from my old wallet to my new
wallet with my old wallet chain.</p>

<p>I walked into the police station... wait.</p>

<p>Special thanks to those who helped me get to the police station.
Ç±Ç± for calling the cops to see where they are, then telling them I
don't have a "stamp" (Japanese version of a signature) so that I'd
only be able to sign for it, not stamp for it.</p>

<p>Thanks to the women about two blocks from the police station for
drawing me a map to it.</p>

<p>I walked into the police station and showed the woman my card.  She
took me to a window and showed the guy my card.  "Ç≥Ç¢Å”" <em>wallet</em>, she
said and I thanked her.  The guy looked at the card, went away, came
back with a bag containing some old beat up wallet with no ID in
it.</p>

<p>"Ç∑Å›Å‹ÇπÇÒ, that's not my wallet.  Ç»Ç¢.  Ç»Ç¢."</p>

<p>But I looked inside.  To my horror, I saw my driver license, my
gaijin card, my bank card.</p>

<p>No cash.</p>

<p>Oh Japan.  What happened to my wallet?</p>

<p>My bank card is broken.  The TDL and gaijin card were creased.  The
wallet looks worn.  Oh and no fucking train card in it either; I just
noticed that.  Sigh.</p>

<p>It must be the case that it got tumbled about in the street or something; that's the only way I can keep faith in Japanese culture - if the cash blew away with the wind then I'm okay with that.  As okay as I can be.</p>

<p>In other news, I got a call from a woman at Å›Å‚Å¥Ç´ÇæÇ¢, asking if
I could do overtime there for four lessons today starting at 5pm.  A
cointoss (before I knew my wallet no longer held cash) said yes.</p>

<p>Last night Janette called around 10pm.  I had already gone to
sleep, and had earplugs in (to keep me sleeping while Matty and Frank
are still awake) so it took me a bit to notice, wake up, answer.</p>

<p>Wow.  Good to hear from Janette; I just wanted to cry at times,
which I couldn't do for some reason; maybe cause really I was just
talking to a voice on the phone and not a real live Janette.</p>

<p>Expressed to her the angst I'm going through in this transition
from US to Japanese life - internet connectivity.  I've got to wean
myself off email and it's killing me - I don't want to "let my friends
down" ... which I know is a concern not completely based in truth, but
it's still there.  I'm afraid to be alone; that's one of my deepest
fears - afraid to lose my friends.  Afraid that my ex-YRUUers will
think I've forgotten about them, when really they still show up in my
dreams (Jason called me last night in a dream (or maybe I called
him)).</p>

<p>I wondered if this is a natural..  no it's natural for me, so it's
natural..  i wonder if this is common, or predictable.  I've got to
release; oops my brain is in overdrive on tangents now.</p>

<p>* grand irony <em>I've got to release <b>right now</b></em> when
struggle only causes tightening</p>

<p>* I've got <em>fans</em> that I've never met!  This is *exactly*
what I've wanted, and I'm like shit!  How do I keep them??? please
don't leave!  And I want to send everyone an email "thanks for reading
my site; I really appreciate it!  you're the best!!" but I can't
realistically spend time doing that cause then I won't be living my
dream, learning Japanese, traveling around, making my site
<em>worth</em> reading in the first place!</p>

<p>((A friend of mine published a web zine called The Texas Gazette (I
dunno if it's still around) but at one point she got featured as a
site of the month on some high traffic site and *BANG* she got a
million emails and she tried to respond to all of the <em>emails</em>
instead of focusing on her publication.  I'll never forget that story
even though parts of me are tempted to tiptoe down that path.))</p>

<p>So.</p>

<p>I read and <em>appreciate</em> every non-spam non-forward email I
get.  Some of the forwards are good too.  Right now my time is
shredded by work, walking everywhere my bike won't seem to take me,
practicing Japanese</p>

<p>Grrrrrrrrrr  why am i making excuses?</p>

<p>I choose not to respond to all the emails I get.  I still love
you.</p>

<p><p><b>Comment:</b>
<br>i like this line_ &ldquo;i wonder if this is natural- no, it&rsquo;s natural to me, so it&rsquo;s natural&rdquo;  <br>
  i am glad i called you; i&rsquo;m thankful you can talk to me about  important issues in your transition.  <br>
  &ldquo;I choose not to respond to all the emails I get. I still love you.&rdquo; good choice<br>
  you express fear that you will lose your fans,more importantly ,your yruu&rsquo;ers<br>
if you do not respond to their emails in kind. you don&rsquo;t want to lose their love and interest in you.  isn&rsquo;t your journal the way to let people keep up with you without having to address each one of us?<br>
  do people read your journal because they love you?  or do they read it because it&rsquo;s interesting? initially, perhaps, it was affection for you as a person that led a reader to your site.  if your site, that is, your writing style and the content(thoughts, dreams,rants,a day in the life diary,feelings, funny episodes, etc.),if all this did not have merit on its own, do you think you could maintain new fans&rsquo; interest and even the attention of your old beloved friends?<br>
  this may be off the track.  you were anxious about returning emails.  i am talking about reaching people thru your journal.<br>
  here&rsquo;s this: how can you give and receive love in a way that keeps you connected to the one&rsquo;s you love and to the ones you don&rsquo;t know but who love you?<br>
  love= action,work<br>
   action of love =discipline, attention<br>
     attention=time, listening,responding with thought only of the other&rsquo;s growth<br>
     discipline=extending oneself in a healthy way so all parties benefit<br>
     this choice to love  well takes energy.  you only have so much energy.  maybe you have to choose which few you can love well.  the others will have to be content with loving you, not because you return their love (attention) but because of who you are. how you live your life.  you may hold the feeling of love for them but cannot possibly respond to each because you are busy living your life that is so interesting( the texas gazette syndrome).  and living your life in a free, conscious, loving , healthy way, is what makes it interesting and inspiring to others.<br>
    alot of this comes from my interpretation of -the road less traveled-and how it applies to your quandry<br>
   does it make sense?</p>

<p>Class was cool today; it was just Olivia and I there.  No
Karly-distraction nor Alicia.</p>

<p>One thing though is they use romaji a lot instead of Ç–ÇÁÇ™Ç», so I
try to ignore it when they write it.  I'll ask for Ç–ÇÁÇ™Ç» next time
as well.  Ç–ÇÆÇø, the younger ÇπÇÒÇπÇ¢ (%) seems more aware that I use
Ç–ÇÁÇ™Ç» instead of romaji.  I appreciate that.</p>

<p>(%) Just at that point the train stopped at a station, and another
train pulled up beside us (across the platform from us).  A woman saw
it, got off our train, onto that train, so I knew it must be an
express train.  I'm going to ÇÊÇ±ÇÕÇ‹, a super big station, so I knew
that an express would stop there.  I joined her and thereby skipped
like 6 stations.  Awright.</p>

<p class=date>1:05pm</p>

<p>Right now I'm at ÇÊÇ±ÇÕÇ‹Å[ÇŸÇÒÇ± Nova, about to attend the voice
training.  Good stuff I hope.</p>

<p>After class I got ..  oh  *during* class (during break) I was
tapped on the shoulder by Ç±Ç±'s mom and I didn't recognize her at
first.  She was all "yammeryammer" and I'm all, "um, hi!" knowing that
a Japanese wouldn't approach me unless s/he was sure of my identity.
I realized it was Koko's mom (have only seen her a couple times in
this sea of Japanese faces) and she said something about the bike.
I'm all, "oh yeah, it's great!" or some shit, not telling her that it
has a flat.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the conversation didn't get to that point, but it did
get to the point where she told me that Koko is at home sleeping, not
feeling all that hot today.</p>

<p>After class, I stopped by a bike shop and the cat fixed the flat
(two punctures in the tube, both by a single small piece of wire that
he found still in the tire) pretty quickly.  They have different
styles of bike maintenence here.  Well, at least he did.  Using pliers
instead of a correctly-sized wrench to get off the nut from the valve
stem (and scarring the threads on the valve stem (<em>threads</em> on
a valve stem!) and then *cut* off the nut to keep from having to
unscrew it all the way), and never actually taking the wheel off the
bike.  That saved a significant amount of time, I imagine, since he
didn't have to reseat the wheel nor fix the train nor any of that.</p>

<p>1470 yen.  Fair enough.  Just glad to have it fixed.</p>

<p>Voice Training II was like a whirlwind of information being blown
at us all at once.  It could have been extended to a two day
conference, but apparently Nova believes it wouldn't benefit from such
an arrangement.  So we go four hours and now I zip off to work four
shifts.</p>

<p>I was smart enough to jump on the Limited Express train.  This
train stops only once between Yokohama and ÇﬁÇ≥ÇµÅ[Ç±Ç∑Ç¨.  That stop
does not include my station in Ç¬Ç»ÇµÇ‹.  I get to be all
sheeeeeewwww right past my station.  hahahahah, non limited-express
suckas!</p>

<p>- - - - -</p>

<p><p>A really funny thing about that story is that there&rsquo;s a direct line from Yokohama to Kawasaki.  I took the line past my station, switched to a different line, went to Kawasaki.</p>

<p>Just now on the train after work and after chillin' at the kiosk
with Steve (!), Scott and Rich, some of the leader type people at my
school.  I dunno if Rich is a trainer, but Scott is; he was one of our
voice trainers today.  They traded some Nova gossip and drinking
stories, which were spawned after my explanation of why I don't drink:
"I heard all the stories in high school and I'm like 'why do you keep
doing it?'"</p>

<p>"It's pretty hard to explain," said one and went on to describe how
he basically gets drunk every weekend.</p>

<p>I also prefer saving money.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Anyway, work itself was pretty good and short; I saw cute Ç∂Ç„ÇÒÇ± in
a different classroom, but I didn't teach her.  After all the classes,
Å†Å‚ came in and told me that one of my students said I was very polite
and a very good teacher.  How awesome to hear!  I've never heard
anyone else get such a compliment; it made me feel quite good.  I'm
glad Steve was there to hear it as well, and he commented positively
on it.</p>

<p>Even though the comments I write in the files are not always
amazing, I always at least mark the files to indicate what lesson
number I have presented to the students.  According to Steve, not
everyone does this.</p>

  you are not missing anything important or beautiful or helpful or healing by choosing not to drink</p>

<p class=dream>I had clocked out of a different work 10 minutes early
where the boss tried to be in such control that he wanted me to pay
him for the final 10 minutes, or at least not get paid for them.</p>

<p class=dream>He asked me until what time I worked and I'm like
"around midnight" and he's all, "well this says you clocked out 10
minutes early."  (well then that's how late I worked) and in my mind
I'm like, <em>dude, did you want me to clock out later even though I
wasn't doing any work?</em> but didn't say anything except like, "I'll
pay you the money right now; it's not a big deal."</p>

<p class=dream>Then later he came over to my house and I lived with a
bunch of tough guys or mafia guys or something and my boss came over
and had four little dogs with him.  He knocked on the door to ask
about the ten minutes and the two younger (misbehaving) dogs came
inside.  He didn't apologize but immediately was all giving orders to
his other two dogs to go get the first two dogs when I was like,
"there should be no dogs in this house" and suddenly women and
children were screaming in fear behind me (they were apparently afraid
of little dogs) and I'm yelling at my boss, "you do NOT let dogs into
MY house!" blah blah and then "I need some help here!" I called to my
goons inside and one of them came out and the boss guy was suddenly
all scared, "don't hurt my ears!" and I said "don't hurt his ears" to
my goon who kinda rolled his eyes and grabbed the guy's shoulders and
put him up against the wall and probably would have done anything I
said, but with all the emotions running around I woke up.</p>

<p>On the way to work today there were two young women on the train
with <em>ridiculous</em> makeup: fucking orange faces, with
orange/yellow/brown hair and with jet black mascara and one of them
had little mirror stars on her eyelashes and shiny silver-white smears
under her eyes.  The other had glitter on her eyelashes and was
putting on white smears below her eyes while on the train.  They both
had on tight skirts and tall-ish black heeled sandal-boots and maybe
fine white fishnet stockings.  Dude.  That was wack.</p>

<p>It may be the case they were going to ÇµÅ‘Å‚, which features some
strangely dressed characters.  Maybe I'll go people watch there
sometime.  I wonder if I could get them to pose for photos for my
book. (*)</p>

<p>Work was okay; pretty busy, but Scott helped me a lot with planning
lessons.  And, I must say, the well-planned lessons went more smoothly
than my normal lessons.  During OJT I was rather turned off of
planning lessons cause the whole operation was just so painful.  But
these planned lessons were quite less than painful.  Once they were
planned.</p>

<p>(*) what book?  I dunno.</p>

<p>I've been home from work for a couple hours; ate some somethings
and some something elses and a liter of OJ while reading the first
chapter of Paul Theroux's <em>The Kingdom By The Sea: a journey around
Great Britain</em>.</p>

<p>Now I'm working on some Voice Training Pre Tasks, designed to "get
me thinking about the stuff we'll be working on in training tomorrow"
in Yokohama.  This will be my first time to visit the Yokohama-honko
Nova.  My understanding is that honko means head office or
something.</p>

<p>I'm trying to get this done so I can sleep so I can get up and
study and attend class in the morning before the training.</p>

<p>Ben Folds "One Down" reminds me of me right now.</p>
