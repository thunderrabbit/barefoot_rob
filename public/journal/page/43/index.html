<p>A: &ldquo;B, can you lead us in a grounding?&rdquo;</p>

<p>B: &ldquo;Yes, but C said he had some business first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>C: &ldquo;Yeah I was just going to say I have to leave early tonight&rdquo;</p>

<p>B: &ldquo;No problem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>D: &ldquo;Was that the grounding?&rdquo;</p>

nose..&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keith Corrigan contacted me on FB, and I thought it was a fake account
trying to lure money out of me, but now I am not so sure.  I still
have a guess that is the case, but it&rsquo;s not as blatant as others I
have seen.</p>

<p>On Wednesdays, I wake up at 5am and leave the house at 5:45am so I can
get on a train that arrives in Noborito at 6:29am but leaves Noborito
at 6:57am.  That gives 58 minutes of sleeping time on the train
including both waiting and riding to Kawasaki.</p>

<p>Then lesson in Solid Square with Ayano, Takato, Yohei, Ai, and I
talking about reasons we (dis)like certain months or seasons.  A bit
challenging lesson because the students are at such different levels.</p>

<p>Then chatted for a long time with Christian at
<a href="https://www.japanese.io/">Japanese IO</a> about their upcoming features:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sharing</li>
<li>Listening</li>
<li>Automagic SRS</li>
</ol>

<p>Hopefully the site will support many people in learning Japanese.</p>

<p>Lunch with Tomoko at SCC and then briefly said HI to Liliko and Hitomi
(who work together) there before lesson with Midori (who works with
Tomoko).</p>

<p>Then to JB for two lessons with elementary school students, and two
lessons with adults from age 24 (or so) to 50 (or so).  These again
were challenging due to different levels.  I&rsquo;m kinda glad Misato could
not make it today.</p>

<p>Walked to the station with Chihomi(?) and Kaori.  Chihomi had just run
a half marathon this past weekend, and asked us abut our marathon
histories.  Mine is zilch, and I was surprised to hear Kaori
had/sometimes(?) runs 5km around Imperial Palace in central Tokyo.  8
times around for a full marathon.  haha yeah I ain&rsquo;t doing that!</p>

<p>Train and then rode home with Lin who usually picks me up at the
station on Wednesday nights.  She had just gone to see
<a href="https://www.amma-rainichi.org/english/">Amma</a> (and Paola, who is
likely to leave Japan for a while) with our neighbor Mai.</p>

<p>I spent a couple hours on MT3 yesterday, culminating in introducing a
new character whose job is to carry marbles onto the stage.  On his
way out, he hit the switch to reverse the stage rotation, so
Squarehead will fall because he is <em>just</em> about to jump off the stage
onto the ramp, but the stage is just about to reverse direction.</p>

<ul>
<li>What elements do you think make this a “quintessential” talk?</li>
</ul>

<p>Not sure what you mean by the talk being quintessential; I think it&rsquo;s
inspired and probably true, but it is not <em>better</em> than other talks on TED.</p>

<ul>
<li>What’s your opinion on this talk?</li>
</ul>

<p>Great to see a &ldquo;famous&rdquo; artist be humble and real about her fears and
modeling how she intends to continue doing her work because it&rsquo;s her work.</p>

<ul>
<li>How would you summarize this talk in a sentence?</li>
</ul>

<p>I take care of the quantity, God takes care of the quality.</p>

<ul>
<li>Why do you think this idea was chosen as an idea worth spreading?</li>
</ul>

<p>We need more creative solutions in the world.</p>

<ul>
<li>Had you seen this talk before? If so, what effect has it had on you?</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep on swimming.</p>

<ul>
<li>What action can you take after watching this talk?</li>
</ul>

<p>Be glad I am doing my creative work as well.

<p>It made light of our human condition.</p>

<li>What’s your opinion on this talk?</li>
</ul>

<p>Engaging, funny, interesting, relatable, eye-opening.</p>

<ul>
<li>How would you summarize this talk in a sentence?</li>
</ul>

<p>Thoughts come through us, not from us.</p>

<ul>
<li>Why do you think this idea was chosen as an idea worth spreading?</li>

<p>More people need to try to stop taking their thoughts so seriously.</p>

<p>nope</p>

<pre><code>HI Jackie!

I would like to make a site for my ongoing project, Marble Track 3.

I need some help kinda imagining how is best to present the
info+content I have, plus I have a few ideas+constraints of how I
think it should go.

I think the site can be implemented as a static website with no
backend coding required.  (Except *possibly* for a section
inviting people to get involved with the project.)

I need help with design and CSS.

For my current site at https://new.robnugen.com/ I am using Hugo
(https://gohugo.io/) to create the site based on a theme and a
bunch of markdown files for content.

For the new site, I would like to use my existing markdown files
for the BLOG portion of the site.

Here is an example BLOG source file
https://bitbucket.org/thunderrabbit/robnugen-journal-entries/raw/master/2018/05/02mt3-retested-large-marble.md

From this, Hugo creates
https://new.robnugen.com/journal/2018/05/02/mt3-retested-large-marble/

I want to keep using the same markdown + YAML format so I do not
have to disrupt my current workflow too much.

Let me know if your eyes have not glazed over and I can tell you
more of what I am thinking.

(reminder to self: BLOG, ABOUT, SUPPORT, SNIPPETS, COMMUNITY )

love and light
- Rob
