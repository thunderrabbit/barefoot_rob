<p>Just rode my unicycle to work!  I fell 3 times, which did not
include the big 8 inch drop between two parking lots.  First time was
at the gate leading out of my apartments (fortunately I fell not too
close to the gate, where I might have grated myself on it), second
time was going off the first curb before crossing the first street (I
would have had to dismount because of traffic anyway), third time was
after crossing the second street (without dismounting) and faltering
going up the bumpy driveway thing.</p>

<p>Other than that, smooth sailing, including under the freeway.  I
had to use the right had traffic lane because the walkway is blocked
with a ROAD CLOSED sign.</p>

<p>Whew!  I was hot when I got inside after all that unicycling!  Yay
unicycle!</p>

<p>Work has been pretty good today.  I've been working through a SAS
example program that they give on their website.  I found a few bugs
in the code and emailed to their tech support.  They thanked me and
offered a few other fixes which I have incorporated, but it's still
not working yet.  I have faith that it will be resolved shortly; they
have been quite responsive with my queries.</p>

<p>Going to lunch with Kristen now.</p>

<p>Crap at work today.  I moved the G3 online and broke all the G3
projects.  Thing is that it all worked in testing on my box.  Dave and
Minh helped me look at it for about an hour, and the best we can tell
is that 100+ variables exist at one point and then don't exist at the
next point.  Seems they aren't being created in the global macro
library.</p>

<p>This reminds me of an error I had some months ago, but I that was
with datasets being created, not variables.  Pooh.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the load on our webservers has been extremely light
today.  We have had two people email us that something is wrong.  I so
hate to have downtime on the G3; I want it to be perfect!</p>

<p>We've been down for some hours now.  At least three hours.</p>

<p>Last night Wende and I saw <em>Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius</em>.
Quite imaginitive and entertaining, if not particularly unrealistic
(or maybe super-futuristic!)</p>

<p>Lots of funny lines and chortles for adults (not Adult Humor), and
some good burps to boot.</p>

<p>Not quite as good as <em>Monsters, Inc.</em> though.</p>

<p>Fred and I are at Wende's for Christmas lunch.  Her
mom, stepdad, half sister are here as well.  And her
friend Danielle from work.</p>

<p>I feel uncomfortable; this is the first time I've
been with her parents since I broke up with Wende. 
Truth seems to be that they are over it apparently
moreso than I.</p>

<p>My energy level is a bit down also because I took
an antihistimine to keep my snot inside instead of
out.</p>

<p>I've never been particularly close to her family,
but I still feel I owe an explanation.  And then
again, I don't.  I just don't know.</p>

<p>Just got home from my dad's house.  There were so
few cars on the roads that the <em>entire</em> way
from his house in Magnolia to 290, we could have
driven in the left hand lane.</p>

<p>Before driving home, we hung out at dad's house for
a while.  Checked out the interior construction; they
are expanding the dining room area to allow for a
bigger table in there (now it barely seats a 4 person
table; it should handle a 6 or 8 person table when they
are done).  Fred cooked eggs and we ate ice cream
while sitting by our step sis Elisé on the futon as
she read <em>Fellowship of the Ring</em>
She had read <em>The Hobbit</em> last night.</p>

<p>Before arriving at my dad's house, Fred and I
stopped by Jack in the Box.  We were inside in line
about 5 minutes, got to the counter, and placed our
order when some more-senior person was all, 'we are
<em>closed</em>' to the cashier.  </p>

<p>That definitely counts as information we could have
used before we waited in line.</p>

<p>Before Jack in the Box, we drove to Tomball from my
house.  Before that, we rode unicycles from my
apartment and down into the 59 construction area
nearby.  I showed Fred some of the more interesting
things to see.</p>

<p>Before that, we drove in from Austin.</p>

<p>Good night!</em>

<p>Fred and I are in Austin and we have just
experienced gift exchange craziness at Ma's husband's
sister Jill's house.  Her two adopted kids were there
and used me as a jungle gym most of the night.  It was
fun at first, but I found them annoying after a
while.</p>

<p>We're in the computer lab at his school now and
he's checking 2600 news and I found Lord of the Rings
starting at 10:45pm.  It's only a Three Hour movie, so
we'll be home in plenty of time to make it to Jon's
house at 9am in the morning. (as opposed to 9am at
night)</p>

<p>Fred lives 2 blocks from where Sally lived when she
lived here. :-)</p>

<p>Hey Rob!</p>

<p>I finished &ldquo;Way of the Peaceful Warrior&rdquo; yesterday
with tears in my eyes on a plane en route to
California.  So i am here now visiting my mother&rsquo;s
parents and my aunt.  good fun.  But i have an
<em>amazing</em> story to tell you!</p>

<p>So tonight my mom, sister, aunt, and I all went to eat
sea food at our favorite seafood spot in So.Cal, Dana
Point.  Good fun after not having seafood in 5 months.
 After dinner we were walking along the pier looking
at the lights on the boats and my aunt said something
about some form of Tai Chi that she does.</p>

<p>Extremely randomly I asked, &ldquo;Susan, do you know who
Dan Millman is?&rdquo; and her initial response was, &ldquo;Yea,
he was in my English class at Berkeley.&rdquo; Inside i went,
&ldquo;wow!&rdquo; outside I said, &ldquo;really?  I just finished
reading one of his books all about his time at
berkeley!&rdquo; to which she said, &ldquo;about that guy in the
gas station?  yeah, i&rsquo;ve beAn to a lot of his book
signings, our paths cross a lot, though he was never
in class cause he was always out doing gymnastics
meets.  after he got back from isreal he said, &lsquo;even
the street cleaners are jewish!!&lsquo;he was a funny guy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>so!  what a small world it is!  yesterday i finish
reading this amazing book and today my aunt has gone
to school with the author!  and apparently she sees
him all the time!  she offered and suggested that she
take my book to get it signed!  i feel bad because i
have underlined and written in the margins on multiple
pages, but i think it would be great!  i just think
its an amazing example of the size of this crazy world
and i wanted to thank you for introducing me to a
great story.</p>

<p>so thats my super story for the evening and i hope it
makes you smile.  also, the book shares the feelings
of Dan in his unhappy marriage, and it reaffirms my
support for your break with Wende.  I think,
spiritually, it was the best thing for both of you, in
the long run.  You should re-read the book.</p>

<p>Smiles and Love,</p>

<p>Brynsies</p>

<p>Just got back from <em>Lord of the Rings</em>.  I
have a new girlfriend, the first girl elf that they
met - the one that asked the river to wash away the
bad guys on horses.</p>

<p>I haven't read the books.  (Fred says I should)</p>

<p>I was surprised that Gandolf died.  But he sure was
cool killing that badass demon guy.  Oh, and I'm so
sure that the rock bridge-stair thing could fall
forward and not knock down the rest of the stairs.
Excellent graphics though.</p>

<p>I loved the fireworks at the Bilbo's b-day
party.</p>

<p>So the movie shifted and I thought, "it's been
about 2 hours I guess," expecting the final part, but
then the screen went black and that was the end of the
movie.  "WHAT?"</p>

<p>Sat through all the credits and tried to figure out
who played who, but all the actors names came up at
once in a big two-column list.  I had no chance of
finding the name.  IMDB, here I come.</p>

<p>Liv Tyler.  Hmmm.  There's no pics of her from the
movie in IMDB that I could find very easily.</p>

<p class=note>(written the next day:)</p>

<p>Oh oh oh, the funny thing (to me) during the film: When they showed
Sauruman's lair, I whispered to Fred, "That's the ghetto of Naboo."
heheh.  Then, when they showed the Elven world Rivendell, I was all,
"that's the penthouse of Naboo."</p>

<p>Fred and I are at KTRU, and I've been here for 4.3
hours, while he's been here for 2 hours or so.</p>

<p>I recorded a tape of my show, which I haven't done
in a pretty long time.  I think I got some pretty
funny stuff recorded, hopefully.</p>

<p>Um, not an amazing shift, or maybe it was and I'm
just too tired to remember.  Oh I had a guy from
Austin call as he was en route to Houston.  He
commented that they have KVRX in Austin also on 91.7
and I told him yup; it's awesome to not have to change
the radio dial between the two cities.</p>

<p>Oh, when I arrived, we were broadcasting WRN (World
Radio Network), which meant no DJ was here.  So I had
to call campus police to let me in.  They said they
had just let someone in, but I sweet talked my way in
and found Scottie had just arrived, rescuing us from
WRN.</p>

<p>I did my shift and Fred arrived around 9:20 and
read a few playlists and stuff on the air.  Good job
him.  We recorded him as well.</p>

<p>But, alas, the next DJs did not show up at 10pm.  I
will write a note to the DJ directors and tell on
them.</p>

<p>Now we are playing Merzbow, a 45 minute track of
noise.  20 minutes remained as I started this journal
entry.</p>

<p>I'm going to go blabber a bit more on air and then
go back to WRN (boo hoo).</p>
