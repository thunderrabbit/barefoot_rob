<p>Amelia and I are awake at 9 so that we may go to church today.  I'm
actually only interested in visiting the YRUU; Kellie, one of the
advisors asked for insights on getting youth to be respectful of one
another.  I can help more if I can see the situation or at least ask
some specific questions about the stories I hear.</p>

<p>I had dreams, and I think they involved being at the Bibby's in
Dallas, but I don't recall more than that.</p>

                        <p><b>Bowling for Columbine</b></p>

<p>Full Price Feature</p>

<p>Number one - with a bullet!  If you don&rsquo;t know, this is Michael
Moore&rsquo;s latest documentary, this time about the culture of violence
in America, especially as per gun killing.  Some terrifying
statistics are reported in this film; I wish I could have recorded it
to a hard disc in my head to give myself facts on hand for future
discussion.  It is not a personal paean of self-aggrandizement as
some have suspected; C-Span has conditioned us to expect nothing but
that.</p>

<p>Regardless whether you agree with his message or not, Moore&rsquo;s gifts
as a filmmaker cannot be denied.  His editing and contrasting of
footage and audio tell a greater story than the individual bytes
being parsed.  Shrewd editing wrings the most content from his quiet,
laissez-faire interview style. Moore lets them do all the talking -
it seems as though he must be leading their answers because, well,
how can people be so foolish as to spout off in a way that so clearly
illustrates how dangerous/wrong/deceptive they are?  People do.</p>

<p>He manages to infuse this carnival of horrors with enough humor
laughter obscured dialogue.  The laughter in my audience was from
their delight, watching his subjects shoot themselves in the foot, as
it were.  He asks the right questions, and they are questions that
need asking, need asking in a public forum, and the very absence of
coherent answers is chilling enough.  His regular guy manner and
Hollywood influence get him meetings with barflies and movie stars,
for great juxtaposition.</p>

<p>I know many of us feel the same way about our society but have been
unable to verbalize it.  It may be too simplistic to say that our
culture is the way it is due to one thing or another; no doubt it is
a complex web of many things.  But few have addressed this angle of
the issue, and it needs addressing. If it is one-sided, it is
certainly the side we don&rsquo;t see, unless we listen between the lines
on NPR or hang out with Noam Chomsky.</p>

<p>Why is our gun murder rate 100-300 times greater than in any other
country in the world?  Why are we so quick to send troops, deploy
ships, whip out a shotgun and yell &ldquo;Get off my lawn?&rdquo; We can shoot
each other because we are completely detached from a sense of
community, interrelation, interdependence.  Other industrialized (not
just Western) countries enjoy the same supposedly inappropriate
stimulus as us, have guns, have corrupt leaders, have &ldquo;mixed
ethnicities&rdquo; in their cities, what is the difference?</p>

<p>It is attitudes, fear, misinformation, a self-centered, consumer
culture.  We&rsquo;ve heard this, as an explanation as to why &ldquo;they&rdquo; hate
us, but we are surrounded by enough self-induced terror, who needs
zealots making a move in our direction.  It&rsquo;s a sobering movie, but
very well-stated.</p>

<p>Canada - we joke it&rsquo;s the largest of our 51 states, but no one there
is denied medical care all (&ldquo;it&rsquo;s a basic human right,&rdquo; scoffs an
Ontario teen), there are 7 million guns in 10 million households, yet
less than 40 gun deaths a year.  The US has over 11,000 gun deaths a
year, many uninsured persons.  AND they are legalizing pot.  Why do
we make fun of Canada again?</p>

<p>There are so many beautiful, unspoken moments in Bowling.  I wish I
could spoil some of it for you but you will just have to go see it.
Moore quotes the social commentary as hilariously propagandized by
South Park the movie, a keen social commentary on blame and social
responsibility, worthy of the same audience Moore carries.  Truth
hurts, even when you can laugh at it.</p>

<p>It is also delicious to hear how irrational and crazy the government
officials sound, blaming Marilyn Manson for the crazy teens (but not
Eminem?  Explain that), yet the Artist Formerly Known As Brian had
some very wise things to say.  Also, there is a brilliant animated
short in the middle of the film which I wish was available for
download - it&rsquo;s a fantastic miniature summary of Moore&rsquo;s thesis.</p>

<p>If you recall in the 1980&rsquo;s, there were picket lines around the
theatres playing a little movie that dared to show the human side of
Jesus&rsquo; man/god nature.  People who had not seen the film picketed it,
reviled it, and claimed its one-sidedness was sinful.  One must see
both sides of any major debate, and that film operated under the
premise that plenty has been done with Jesus&rsquo; God-side.  Moore&rsquo;s film
is the Last Temptation of Charleton.  The people who most need to see
it won&rsquo;t, and I wish I could change that - I hope my readers who see
it will help as well.  Roger Ebert yapped at some length about
Moore&rsquo;s excessive use of &ldquo;theatre.&rdquo;  Without the organized
presentation, the public embarrassment of the guilty, the message
would not be heard.  World famous improviser Keith Johnston says that
we go to the theatre to see people change.  We watch Michael Moore
hoping for this change.  Keep the theatre, Mike, it is what makes
your message both understandable and heard.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m going to get loads of disgruntled email from my readers,
who do not have to agree with me, but I hope they will see the film
and argue with me intelligently.  Better yet, see the film, and
challenge someone you can speak to in person to see it as well and
discuss it with them.  I am here to recommend (or not) films, and all
politics aside, this is a fantastically made film.</p>

<p>Super awesome special thanks to Calder and her mom for getting me a
place to sleep, and leading me to the place to sleep tonight.</p>

<p>Calder's mom seems really cool and patient and funny and able to
deal with inanity around her.  Five minutes in the house turned to 30
minutes of animated conversation and billiard ball rolling plus five
minutes of coaxing Calder out the door and into the car with all her
stuff.</p>

<p>I'm so thankful for the quick turnaround Calder did on getting me a
place to stay.</p>

<p>AND(!) ("there's more?") she got me a funny book with a funny name
and a gay pride kitten made of those round melty bead things!
Awesome.  I think I know just the person who will love the cat.</p>

<p>Hugs to Calder's mom and Calder as they left.</p>

<p>I came to church with Amelia today just to talk to Kellie about a
question she asked me via email.  I ended up talking instead with aw
man I forgot her name, the DRE.  I hopefully gave her some helpful
thoughts and insights.  Didn't get to talk super long, but hopefully
it helped.</p>

<p class=date>12:21pm</p>

<p>Amelia and I just walked Magic (the dog) around the neighborhood
and she queried me on how I've found my balance between being a youth
and an advisor.  I told her that it took awhile for me to find the
balance and that now I have been driven by at least two different
thoughts:</p>

<p>!) YRUU is my priority over all other activities.</p>

<p>@) I have no ego in YRUU.</p>

<p>Number (!) above might sound weird considering I'm not going to San
An, but ultimately I trust this is better for the youth, though it's
hard for me to see that now.</p>

<p>Number (@) above is true in the following way: if the YRUU activity
is truly being run by youth (and doesn't violate the community agreed
rules) I don't care what the activity is.</p>

<p>There are certainly other driving factors that guide my involvement
with YRUU, but those are two that stand out for me.</p>

<p>Jenny hoped I hadn't written about her today, but I will just
because.</p>

<p>She slept until 12:30pm today.  That was after falling asleep
during both movies that we watched last night.</p>

<p>She's been vying for attention from Erik, Andrew, Sean, who are all
playing video games.</p>

<p>So I'm at Megan's house.  Super thanks also to Megan and
<em>her</em> mom for letting me stay on such short notice</p>

<p class=date>11:54pm</p>

<p>Ah, now I remember having met Megan's mom Lee-anne (sp).  We
chatted for a while; she asked about my trip and upcoming plans, and
told me about her brother's new job as the intake nurse at the local
jail and about the awesomeness of their house (originally built in
1938, then moved to this location when Loop 244 was built), which they
have been expanding and remodeling.  Nice.</p>

<p>Ahhh fuzzy flannel sheets.  So perfect.  Thank you so much!</p>

<p>I'm getting tired of my adventure I think.  Maybe I'm just flat
tired physically (after staying up late watching movies, and up early
for church) and mentally (for working on Kim's website and reading
livejournal and news.google.com)</p>

<p>But what I'm noticing is that I'm less and less planning ahead my
adventure.  I gave Amelia only 1 day's notice, and I emailed Calder
<em>today</em> to see if I can say HI to her tonight.  I don't know
where/if I'll stay in Tulsa overnight tonight.  blah.</p>

<p>I don't remember their phone number or Bhyllx's email address or
nothin' to give them *any* advanced warning.  Poop poop poop.</p>

<p>Holy shit it's five am.  Um, we went bowling tonight and had a
great time.  I got 9 pins down by pushing the ball while kneeling
before the lane.  Good stuff.</p>

<p>Christian and Andrew did well, including lots of spin and between
the leg throws and lots of variations.  Man I'm tired.</p>

<p>In my mind is my own rave music.  I just bought buy 1 get one free
tall thin boxes of crackers that I twisted around like glo sticks in
my own little rave while in line at OscoDrug here in Columbia.</p>

<p>3068.15 miles since Dallas.  146441 miles total under Scott's
belt(s).</p>

<p>Leaving for Springfield now.</p>

<p class=date>1:04pm</p>

<p>I'm well on my way to Springfield, and pulled off where I saw gas
for 99 cents per gallon!  But the station is closed, apparently out of
business.  I wonder why..</p>

<p>I just realized that I don't know where in Springfield is a
Kinko's.  I had looked it up at Kinko's in Columbia, but my browser
crashed last night while I had a bunch of windows open reading
articles via <a href="https://news.google.com">news.google.com</a> and
accidentally clicked on something and the browser died after it
couldn't connect or something silly.  Anyway, the point is I will
actually have to <em>ask</em> someone where I can find a kinko's so I
can get in touch with Amelia to get directions to her crib.  It's all
good.</p>

<p>Oh, 3202.1 miles traveled since Dallas, and I'm in Buffalo,
Missouri, listening to 96.5fm broadcasting from Springfield.</p>

<p class=date>1:49pm</p>

<p>3235.5 miles traveled.  Just spent a lot of the last 30 minutes
talking with Marcel (!!!) and hearing all the recent awesome stories
of kids' growth (Adrien understanding Lego transmissions, Lori
noticing his haircut after no one at the office did, Brittney (sp?)
growing her vocabulary by the day)..  we were about to hang up and
then took a five minute discussion of world politics and such.  I'm
enjoying having been reading up on news stuff.</p>

<p>I'm parked now at a gas station where gas is ... $1.429 per
gallon.  I'm going to ask if they know where a Kinko's is.</p>
