<p>Regarding the <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4136899?start=0&amp;tstart=0">new Safari search bar</a>:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad that I can just type keywords and Safari knows I&rsquo;m not trying to search for the invalid URL <a href="https://funny%20cat%20videos">https://funny%20cat%20videos</a></p>

<p>But now all I see is &ldquo;funny cat videos&rdquo; where I would like to see the URL <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=funny+cat+videos">https://www.google.com/search?q=funny+cat+videos</a></p>

<p>The interwebs are based on the concept of hyperlinks, not hypersearchterms. It&rsquo;s a pain for me now to use Safari to create links for sharing.</p>

<p><a href="/images/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-02-17-at-10.10.31-AM.png"><img src="/images/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-02-17-at-10.10.31-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2013-02-17 at 10.10.31 AM" /></a></p>

<p>Maybe Safari is simply trying to hide <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7097270/whats-up-with-this-google-url">Google&rsquo;s new improved  URLs</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;sugexp=les%3B&amp;gs_rn=3&amp;gs_ri=psy-ab&amp;qe=ZnVubnkgY2E&amp;qesig=6dbjvA15ZyzNj-pYiqMVVw&amp;pkc=AFgZ2tlwoaAeFle1-MZ1VJeAT5JjH68EbH6kk37DXAhTcWItN38JuEfWBFesvHyRIONaCHPoB_zUFGwGgvXhhFo7UYSRJaIIJw&amp;cp=8&amp;gs_id=u&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=funny+cat+videos&amp;es_nrs=true&amp;pf=p&amp;tbo=d&amp;output=search&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;oq=funny+ca&amp;gs_l=&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.42553238,d.dGY&amp;fp=a5a3d6300bcf4b24&amp;biw=1394&amp;bih=596">https://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;sugexp=les%3B&amp;gs_rn=3&amp;gs_ri=psy-ab&amp;qe=ZnVubnkgY2E&amp;qesig=6dbjvA15ZyzNj-pYiqMVVw&amp;pkc=AFgZ2tlwoaAeFle1-MZ1VJeAT5JjH68EbH6kk37DXAhTcWItN38JuEfWBFesvHyRIONaCHPoB_zUFGwGgvXhhFo7UYSRJaIIJw&amp;cp=8&amp;gs_id=u&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=funny+cat+videos&amp;es_nrs=true&amp;pf=p&amp;tbo=d&amp;output=search&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;oq=funny+ca&amp;gs_l=&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.42553238,d.dGY&amp;fp=a5a3d6300bcf4b24&amp;biw=1394&amp;bih=596</a></p>

                        <p>##09:50 Sunday 17 February 2013</p>

<p>When I got home from the iOS meeting, Lin was watching Shawshank Redemption on TV via our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_On_demand">video-on-demand</a> service. I joined her once the final rape scene was over; up to that point, I don&rsquo;t really like the movie. When the final credits rolled, I said, &ldquo;oh, I thought that was Tom Hanks,&rdquo; and she was like, &ldquo;no that was Green Mile.&rdquo; I was like, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen Green Mile,&rdquo; and she goes WHAT?? and I was like, WHAT??? and she was like WHAT???? and I was like WHAT??? for about a minute.</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s been wanting to see A.I. as well so she went and rented A.I. and Green Mile for 100 yen each.   I chose to watch A.I. instead of Green Mile last night because A.I. is shorter, and I&rsquo;ve never known Lin to watch an entire movie (late at night on our couch) without sleeping.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen A.I. a couple of times, and when I watch it, I always think of Chez who was really moved by the movie.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t cry this time while watching it, though I have in the past.</p>

<p>We did watch the &ldquo;making of A.I.&rdquo; this time, whereas I hadn&rsquo;t in the past.  I wonder <a href="https://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+kubrick+died">how Kubrick died</a> (<em>he types, while seated in front of a portal with high speed access to essentially all of humankind&rsquo;s information</em>).</p>

<p>I was reminded of an interesting article about Kubrick&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Shining&rdquo; as his confession that he helped make footage for Apollo 11 missions.   <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=kubrick+shining+apollo+11">kubrick+shining+apollo+11/a&gt;</a></p>

<p>From <a href="https://dendory.net/blog.php?id=511ecb55">https://dendory.net/blog.php?id=511ecb55</a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m cross posting this here because it&rsquo;s ironic to do so</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There had been rumors around the web, but now it&rsquo;s official, <a href="https://blog.posterous.com/thanks-from-posterous">Posterous is shutting down</a>. For those who don&rsquo;t know, Posterous is a Tumblr competitor, a place people used to blog, and a few years back there was no saying which of the two would emerge as the leading platform. Ever since Twitter bought them however, it became obvious that Posterous was losing, and today they confirmed that the whole service is shutting down very soon.</p>

<p>This is particularly ironic since in its early years, Posterous billed itself as the <a href="https://blog.posterous.com/make-the-switch-to-posterous">place to move to from other dieing services</a>, and now they are the ones biting the bullet. So what this means for millions of blogs is that they will have to transfer their data to a new service, but most likely more critical, that their space on the web will need to change. This means changing links, losing any previous SEO, and starting anew.</p>

<p>This is a great reminder of why owning your online presence is so important. Just a year ago few would have been able to predict Posterous would not last, just like now people post on Tumblr, Facebook, Twitter and so on, without any concept of how long their content is going to be around.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Own your domain name.</strong> If you want to post content, anything more substantial than cat pictures, things you may want to come back to in the future, you should own your domain name. It&rsquo;s cheap and ensures that your links won&rsquo;t have to change even if you need to move to a new platform. Then, once posted on your own space, you can share links to Twitter &amp; co.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Use services that have open APIs.</strong> If you post content on a host that has no content export policy, then you are basically throwing that effort into a black hole. The instant that they shut down, you might lose it all.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Use these concepts for anything of importance that you do online.</strong> There are rumors that Google might one day shut Google Reader down, do you have your feeds exported as an OPML file? Do you periodically download your email using IMAP from your web mail service? Do you have your calendar and contacts synced to a local machine?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I feel for Posterous users, but for now this is also a reminder for the rest of us.</p>

<p>I wonder wtf happened.</p>

<p><strong>We are performing maintenance on the provisioning service. All provisioning requests will remain in pending status until maintenance is complete, at which time all pending requests will be automatically processed.</strong></p>

<p>I took this screenshot last night at 11:22pm. It&rsquo;s now 7:34am as I write this, so it&rsquo;s been down for more than 8 hours.</p>

<p><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/82153/for-how-long-is-apples-provisioning-service-typically-down">People on ASE are wondering as well</a>, but not as many people are wondering as who are saying it&rsquo;s not a good question.</p>

<p>Tariq and I worked on the card game yesterday for about five hours.  Lin was out with her aunt and uncle so I cooked the pizza Lin made so Tariq and I enjoyed that during our work time.</p>

<p>He suggested a complete overhaul of the side menu, that which was supposed to be &ldquo;the same for all our card game apps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was like moe joe at first, but after thinking about it a bit, the suggested solution does solve several problems, including UI and UX.</p>

<p>It causes a couple of problems for me in the coding department, but it&rsquo;s just a simple matter of programming.</p>

<p>Though I spent a lot less time on it, five people gave me stars on my DrawQuest drawing</p>

<p>Our new friend Jana happens to live in the same neighborhood as Lin&rsquo;s old high school friend Mikako!  Tonight was the night we all met at 6pm in Jiyugaoka for sushi at a 回転すし restaurant and then for a drink and ice cream covered hand made donuts at a shop that Mikako likes.</p>

<p>Talked about Jana&rsquo;s <a href="https://tourdafrique.com/tour-overview/?t=tour-dafrique">Tour d&rsquo;Afrique</a> experience, Paola&rsquo;s yoga classes (three of us know each other through Paola), my under-construction app, Jana&rsquo;s school (where Mikako used to attend), our love of animals, etc etc blah blah, and generally enjoyed a lovely time.</p>

<p>I just thought of a new idea for <a href="https://drawquest.com">DrawQuest</a>.  I can&rsquo;t show the full animation here, but if you have an iPad, download the app, and find me (thunderrabbit), you can see it.</p>

<p>I drew a snowman who then thought about killing his maker, but then the dog barked and the snowman reverted to his normal happy state.</p>

<p>This works easily because the eraser too erases down to the original image, not down to the blank canvas.</p>
