<p>Slept for 2 hours and then Dan turned on his music real loud
  (good-ish dance music, though the player skipped occasionally) and
  woke me up with that and clanging around in the kitchen.  Orivia and
  Jen came down and then Jen left and then <em>Lord of the Rings
  2</em> went into the VCR.</p>

<p>I slept-ish through a lot of this, but decided I'd like to watch
  the movie and got up for it.  They had no idea I was home already
  and were apologetic.  No worries, mates.</p>

<p>Jen, Grace, and あいこ came back near the end of the movie and
  watched the rest of it.  Orivia and I read some of the subtitles and
  had them confirmed by あいこ.  Nice.</p>

<p>Today at work I found that I was happier and bantered more with
  Benny and Carla et. al. more than months prior.  Not sure what is
  the difference, but I'm releasing the need to know that.  I'm
  having more fun.</p>

<p>After work I wondered about transferring to a remoter part of
  Japan, to see what that life would be like.</p>

<p class=dream>I was coloring a picture of three chefs in a coloring
  book.  Just systematically slowing filling the shapes with color,
  being careful not to go outside the lines, gently slowly filling in
  all the nooks and crannies.</p>

<p class=dream>I was with a male friend of mine, working on this
  little project with him.  In the background a rock band was playing
  covers of loud 80s rock bands, kinda one step down in loudness from
  glam rock.  My friend was then cleaning up some wax and talking to
  it like, "I don't have time for this; I don't care if you are my
  girlfriend; I gotta go."</p>

<p>And I'm like, "wha?!" and woke up because I gotta go to Japanese
  lesson!</p>

<p>Morag and I studied on Friday night after work.  She agreed that
  she and I are closer to the same than I thought the previous night.
  We both have lists of potential mates and we both kick the
  potentials off the list before the long term relationships happen.
  She just kicks off before a short term relationship can happen.</p>

<p>release and allow positive thought forms to manifest themselves

<p class=dream>At KTRU but I wasn't supposed to be the one DJing and I
  turned off the station when I left, kinda thinking that the signal
  must be coming from somewhere else than this studio, as I was not
  the official DJ for that timeslot.  I walked out of the studio,
  which was like a kiosk sized building in the middle of an entrance
  to a university and Ali came up some stairs (from underground) to be
  like, "what happened?"  except he goes, "was that Scott or J-lo who
  just left the station?" "what do you mean? There is no one there
  now" "cause you just went off the air."  and it was only then that I
  realized that *had* been the signal and I was mad that they were
  doing a half ass job of DJing, or actually a no ass job cause they
  weren't even there; what kind of thinking is that; anyone can just
  put on a single CD and leave the studio.  In fact, it is an FCC
  violation to do that, to leave the station unattended.  So I went
  back in there to start DJing and woke up.</p>

dear houston rally forms
why do you need to know my gender?

Well, if you are a boy (like your wonderful self is) you have cooties.
I think the Houston rally forms need to know if you have cooties.

<p>Hung out with Morag after work today and told her about my list of
  crushes and that for a while, she was on my list.  Turns out she has
  a similar list of crushes (similar in its crushiness, dissimilar in
  its contents).  We discussed our patterns and the list, it seems,
  is where the similarity ends.  She is quick to kick people off her
  list, whereas I must try to kick people off my list before it grows
  unweildy in its size.  She hasn't dated in a long while and I
  haven't not dated in a long while.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I told her briefly my addiction and more extensively what Rebecca
  Montgomery, Char Crofut, and Richard Unger told me.  You gonna be
  huge.</p>

<p>At work I was minding my own business in the teachers' room on a
  free lesson when one of the staff came in, "Robu, student is
  waiting."  and I had a momentary freakout that maybe I had read the
  schedule wrongly, but I hadn't; there was no name on the timeslot.
  J-lo was there to back me up (he's an AT (I think) or something) so
  that was cool; he handled the staff, and I went to the class and had
  a chat with the student (who hadn't brought his book and didn't want
  to use my book, but did want to level up) and I was like, "dawg, you
  gotta pick up the pace if you want to get to level 4" and I didn't
  tell him that he shouldn't even be in level 5, but more like he's a
  6 with a dangerous vocabulary and tries to overcomplicate
  everything, which I subsequently learned he was intentionally trying
  to overcomplicate so that his structures would be worthy of level
  5.</p>

<p>I like to think that my advice will be helpful for him.  Keep it
  simple and speed it up.</p>

<p>I explained that if the sentence is long and beautiful but takes an
  hour to say, we teachers are like, "wtf was the first part of that
  sentence; I can't remember it anymore..."  and I think he
  understood.</p>

<p>I made him tell me stories and then I told the same story in 30 to
  45 seconds that took him 4 or 5 minutes and I made him tell me the
  same story again in under a minute.  That helped his fluency some.
  In addition, I shortened his circumlocuitous manner of speaking.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Saw かおり, KG みき (there to sign up for more lessons), a
  different woman than かおり's みき who seemed to be hanging out with
  かおり though I don't remember ever having met her before, and ゆたか,
  who apparently was in Morag's Club 7 voice on shopping.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I learned the names of なおひろ, ともなお, and りゅうじ, three
  level 6 men in my last class.  I am making a concerted effort to
  remember male students' names as well.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Had a chat with our level 2 student のりこ, whose name I can now
  remember.  I didn't remember until she mentioned that she's only
  been out of Japan once (to Waikiki and San Francisco) but her
  English is realllly good grammatically and structurally, but doesn't
  have the speed or intonation of a native.</p>

<p>Yesterday I wore long underwear.  They didn't seem to fit well in
  the butt, but oh well.</p>

<p>Today I'm wearing them again, and they fit much better.  I noticed
  I had worn them backwards yesterday.  And I wasn't even trying to be
