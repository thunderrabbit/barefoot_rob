<p>Everyone is asleep or super duper tired.  I'm just
writing to capture our short Silent Football game.</p>

<p>Bryn and I explained the rules to Michael, who did
quite well in picking up how to play.  It took him a
bit to be comfortable with tattling on Bryn, but he
did that a couple of times after we said stuff like,
"Mr Michael may say something like quote Miss Bryn has
said quote himself unquote unquote," but that was a
bit too confusing for a new player that has very few
role models to use.</p>

<p>The game ended at an arbitrary moment, and
ironically just as Michael schrodemed a shrug when he
meant to zoom.  For the second time.  We melted into a
quiet bit of giggles and assured him that the game is
much more interesting with more than 3 people.</p>

<p>Bedtime now.</p>

ahead of CST)</p>

<p>Wende and I are just now awake.  The house is
bustling with breakfast noises and fragrances.  I'm
about to go do errands with Nick and then we'll pick
up Bryn at noon!</p>

<p>I've been <em>very</em> excited about getting to
see Bryn; I've had at least 3 dreams about seeing her
in the past 2 nights.</p>

<p>Last night we had lots of family over to Nick and
Irene's for dinner and a surprise celebration for
Nick's parent's 32nd wedding anniversary!</p>

<p>We had Texas style food last night - barbecued meat
and sausage, potato salad, pasta salad (with pasta
pieces in the shape of Texas) and ranch style
beans.</p>

<p>For the party, we had lamingtons, small cake (size
of a candy bar) with chocolate and coconut on top.  I
grabbed one and offered it to Wende.  She was like,
"eww coconut; no way" so I took a bite and it was very
spongey.  In my mind: <em>hmmm, you wouldn't like the
texture...</em> and I kept trying to bite through it,
but(!) it was foam rubber! Hahahhahahahaahaha!!!</p>

<p>Those in the know were laughin' and said, "shhh
shhh don't give it away."</p>

<p>There were seven foam rubber lamingtons among about
16 or 20 real ones.</p>

<p>I talked a lot with Elizabeth who is in some type
of hospitality school; she can carry six plates now
and even demonstrated for us with paper plates.</p>

<p>Breakfast now.</p>

                        <p class=date>10:21 am Friday 16 February 2001</p>

<p>Nick made a great breakfast for us of eggs, bacon,
toast.  No vegemite today.</p>

<p>We are in Emma's car now going to the bank and
other errands and stuff.</p>

<p>Interesting: All youth between 18 and 21 must have
stickers on their windshield that have a big white "P"
on red background.  It stands for probationary.  It's
a national thing, says Nick.  Nick is driving so we
pulled them off.  They are that flimsy plastic-ish
material that adheres to any smooth surface yet pulls
off easily.</p>

<p>When Nick started the car, awesome thumping beats
thumped from her CD player.  The CD has progressed
into music that is basically rock with an electronic
pipe organ in the background; I'm not very impressed
with this part.  Oh well.</p>

<p>One interesting thing I've noticed is that I'm hard
pressed to guess what someone's voice will sound like
when I see them.  I imagine one could have predicted
such a challenge would arise, but I didn't.</p>

<p class=date>10:46 am</p>

<p>Tom and I just made up a new game called P on the
Ceiling!  These P's are cut so that they will stick to
the ceiling kinda like velcro.  Very funny.</p>

<p class=date>5:36 pm</p>

<p>Huge big hug to Bryn when she came out of the
jetway.  So good to see her!!</p>

<p>Talk talk talk talk talk all the way back to the
house and talk talk to family while sitting on the
inflatable couch in the living room.</p>

<p>Then Nick and Irene dropped Wende, Bryn and me off
at the train station and we are in downtown Melbourne
seeing the city and looking for a kangaroo scrotum
coin purse for $5 US.</p>

<p>We are right now inside the Daimaru, the big big
shopping center in Melbourne, which has a large glass
tower built entirely around an old brick building and
tower thing.  Now the brick tower is inside and in the
air conditioning instead of outside with the rest of
the buildings.</p>

<p>We just ate ice cream from New Zealand Ice Cream,
and it's pretty good; similar to Amy's or Marble Slab,
but smaller.</p>

<p>But just now, the very most amazing thing in ice
cream history:  wasabi ice cream.  I just had a
sample, and it tastes cold and sweet like ice cream,
while hot like wasabi.  Wasabi!</p>

<p> I offered some to Bryn and she tasted it, and then
was all, "bluh blah bluh yuck! what is that?  I guess
I should have asked first."</p>

<p>That was funny.</p>

<p>I think I'll take a picture of the label.</p>

<p class=date>7:02 pm</p>

<p>We are at Hard Rock Cafe.  I bought a Beastie Boys
2001 calendar for $20 AUS.</p>

<p>Bryn says:</p>

<p class=message>Hard rock cafe is my favorite
restaurant.  this experience is bomb.  oz is bomb,  we
saw so many cheap ass australian shops today i'm
surprised rob and wende aren't tired of this place
already.  and yet they trek on.  tomorrow is the
wedding.  rob is my "sit next to" date.  because this
is rob's i will now take this opportunity to write to
rob.  we haven't spoken as much since i've beAn here
as we did back home, and definitely not as much as had
invisioned, but its not a bad thing because as you,
wende, and i sit happily at a table, (a bit chilly on
wende and i's sides) i realize we were never that far
apart.  how easy it has beAn to smile at old things
and, well to just smile being here.   its good.  i
hope i haven't changed too much.  i hope it remains
this good and this exciting.  you are eating big
nachos.  life will proceed.  i love being here with
you and wende.  this is infintely good.</p>

<p class=message>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i love you. 
smile.</p>

<p class=message>brynsies</p>

<p class=date>8:37 pm</p>

<p>Beaner and I are watching Aussie Rules Football (or
just OZ Rules (or just footy)) and Wende has gone to
Target to get towels for tomorrow.  Bryn is writing a
card to her sister Melissa.</p>

<p>OZ Rules is a wacky crazy wild high pace wild game.
 Rugy shaped ball and players can kick, run, hit the
ball in any direction to get the ball through their
intended goalpost.  Players can be tackled, have the
ball stripped, grab shirt, anything (it seems).  They
wear no protective gear except for shirt and shorts.. 
Wow.</p>

<p>It's still light outside even thought it's so late.
 I *love* that part of summer!</p>

<p>(Oh, a difference in culture:  waitstaff are not
tipped in restaurants.  They get paid hourly and
that's it.  Therefore we can sit here all night and
the waiter doesn't care.  The restaurant as a whole
would care if they were short on tables, but they are
not.</p>

<p class=date>9:24 pm 16 Feb 2001</p>

<p>We're still watching Aussie Rules Football on the
tele now, still at Hard Rock Cafe.  Wende has just
returned with towels from Target.</p>

<p class=date>1:26 am Saturday 17 February 2001</p>

<p>Bryn and I have been up talk talk talk talk talkin'
looking at her pictures from exchange student stuff
and talking about YRUU and looking at the Houston
Rally mugbook.</p>

<p>Going to bed now.</p>

<p>I went shopping for Nick at the Duty Free
store:</p>

<pre>
12 rolls fuji 200 speed  36 exp
1 roll 800 36 exp
1 roll B&W  kodak 36  200 speed
</pre>

<p>They only had the 12 rolls, no 800 speed nor black
and white.</p>

<p>"You understand you won't be able to use it until
you leave the country?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh yeah."  I lied.  <em>whatever</em> I
thought.</p>

<p>Paid for the film and got the bag, totally sealed
and taped and included a warning:</p>

<p>WARNING
<br>$5000 FINE
<br>TAX AND CUSTOMS REGULATIONS APPLY</p>

<p>And goes on to say that I must show this sealed bag
to the customs agent along with the sealed receipt
attached to the bag.</p>

<p>Hmm.</p>

<p>My passport number is on the bag, and certainly in
their computerized system, so when I scan my passport
to get out of the country, they will be all, "so,
where's the bag?"</p>

<p>Doh!</p>

<p>Oh well; we can use it when we get home.</p>

<p>We are considering if we can unseal the bag and put
the film back in and make it look like it remained
sealed...  I'm really not comfortable with trying to
save tax on $69 AUS at a risk of $5000 or 12 months in
prison.</p>

<p>The bathroom in this house does not have a lock on
the door.  And this is the bathroom off the main
hallway of the house.  I don't know if that is common
in OZ, or if it's just a quirk of this house.</p>

<p>The toilet is even more interesting.  There is no
"handle" to flush the toilet.  On the top of the tank,
there are 2 buttons.  One smaller than the other. 
Each of them flushes the toilet when pressed.  The
smaller button uses less water than the big one, and
they each use less water than a common US toilet.  The
tank is smaller than a US toilet tank, so even using
both of them together uses less water than a US
toilet.</p>

<p>It feels like I've been asleep four hours
hopefully.  I cannot see what the time is that just
printed. I cannot see what I'm typing. So cramped. 
throat so dry.  We stil have water and I jst drank
some.  Wende is so cute because I had my glasses
folded and hanging from my shirt.  When I woke up, I
found hers hanging from my shirt as well.  :-)</p>

<p>I'm going to sleep some more.</p>

<p class=date>12:51 am</p>

<p>I think I just felt us gently descend a bit, but
I''m sure it's not time for approach.  Was it a gentle
turbulence?</p>

<p class=date>1:01 am</p>

<p>I am totally certain I just felt our airspeed
decrease.  3 distinct gentle little slowdowns.</p>

<p>I just looked at the time 1am.  Ack! 8 more hours
to go; we are not yet halfway there.</p>

<p>actually 9 hours to go because we left late.</p>

<p>I've been thinking that we should save our dollars
more an fly first class next time we go on a long ass
trip off the continent (not including Hawaii)</p>

<p>Although, if when the change jar for Hawaii is
full, we have plenty for first class, I don't think we
would need to scrimp on it.</p>

<p>(I have had a five
gallon`glass`jar`since`I`was`with`Tammy, and we
started filling it with silver "silver" coins
(no`pennies)`and`said`"when`it's`full,`we`will`go`see`the</p>

<p>shit I just realized I've been hitting the wrong ke
for space.</p>

<p>We said that when it's full we will go to Hawaii. 
Wende and I have kept the jar and the original
idea.</p>

<p class=date>2:52 am</p>

<p>They just turned the cabin lights on, but it's
3am.. what is up with that?</p>

<p>Maybe this is our between meal refreshment
time.</p>

<p class=date>3:03 am</p>

<p>Yup - little sandwiches and little apple juices.  I
got mine, but I'm not going to eat it now. I'm going
back to sleep.</p>

<p class=date>4:21 am Wednesday 14 February 2001</p>

<p>I pretty much feel awake; I have slept basically
for 7 hours.  I will sleep more in a  bit.</p>

<p>The movie Duets is on our video thing.  It's pretty
bad from what Wende said.  It looks bad from what I
can see (with no audio)</p>

<p class=date>4:36 am</p>

<p>we have just crossed the international date line
probably 20 minutes ago.</p>

<pre>
8 hours 52 minutes in the air
537mph
38000 feet
-50 C
</pre>

<p class=date>4:44 am</p>

<p>I wonder if we will develop teleportation for
humans in my lifetime.</p>

<p>Oh, about an hour ago, Roy G Biv was evident
outside behind us.  Now we are flying as if over the
clouds of Bespin, but not quite as bright.</p>

<p>oh and when we crossed the date line, we had just
crossed over the equator too.</p>

<p class=date>5:21 am</p>

<p>Hey, Gail!  The man behind me is reading Arabic
laws and discusion of the laws, from what I understood
him to say.  The book is about 2 inches thick and 8 x
11 inches otherwise.</p>

<p>The typeface is large in the middle of the paper,
and smaller typeface outside that, in columns nearly
around it, and then even smaller typeface outside of
that.</p>

<p>I don' reaaly have a way to recreate that on my
site, here, but I'll think about it.</p>

<p class=date>5:41 am</p>

<p>In English, Efriam is his name.  I wrote him a note
and blessed his travels and stuff.  He is writing a
note in Hebrew for my friend Gail.  I hope I'm correct
in remembering that it's Hebrew she is trying to
learn!  :-)</p>

<p>I don't know what he will write, and if I find out,
I won't write it here because I don't want to give it
away for Gail.</p>

<p class=date>6:02 am</p>

<p>I just wrote Wende a valentine's letter, thanking
her for such a wonderful trip together.</p>

<p class=date>6:12 am</p>

<pre>542 mph
2071 miles left
-50 C  -59 F
38000 ft = 11582 m 
10:28 hours since departure, 
5633 miles = 9065 km  traveled.
</pre>

<p>According to the video display, we are at the same
latitude as Madi,  tad east  of Moumea</p>

<p>A long time ago we passed just southeast of
Honolulu</p>

<p class=date>6:17 am</p>

<pre>
2005 miles to destination.
</pre>

<p>It's 1:18pm yesterday at my work.</p>

<p>We went through customs pretty easily, I think
because we had ETA (Electronic Tourist Authority)
instead of paper.</p>

<p>Left hand side of the road driving would take some
getting used to.</p>

<p>The terrain reminds me a lot of some of the
outskirts of Austin.</p>

<p class=date>11:53 am</p>

<p>Arrived at Irene and Nick's house and I won't write
too much while there's people to say HI to.</p>

<p>Breakfast.  Sausage and eggs or banana cinamon
crepes with coconut.</p>

<p>Wende had sausage because she didn't want coconut. 
I had crepes because mmmmmm banana cinamon.</p>

<p>We are just west of Noumea now.</p>

<p>3 hours to go.</p>

<pre>
513 mph 
38000 feet 
-59 F = -51 C
</pre>

<p>I think our steward looks like Keanu Reeves, but
Wende says, "no, he (steward) is cute."</p>

<p class=date>9:09 am</p>

<p>Just watched <em>Bedazzled</em>.  That's a movie
that Wende and I enjoyed at the theater.</p>

<pre>
507mph
38000 feet
-58F
</pre>

<p>the video says we are very close to Sydney, and
therefore very close to land, and suddenly there is
terrific cloudcover; is it due to the continent?

<p>Will I be able to see the shore?   Oh - we aren't
over land yet..  maybe 20 minutes?</p>

<p>So the water has been mesmerizing to me.  Texture
like an orange peel closeup.  There was a portion
where I could see the orange peel dots and then gentle
waves way larger than the dots, not affecting the dots
per se.  Very interesting.</p>

<p>The clouds we're over look like cirrus clouds, and
a layer of cumulus under them.  I can't really see the
water, but there are patches of non-clouds, but they
don't line up for me.</p>

<p class=date>9:20 am</p>

<p>I can see water again.  Oh, and there seems to be a
oh my gosh we are right over the coast!!!</p>

<p>Like a perfect fractal from blue to tan to rolling
green hills and a city.  I wonder where we are.  The
screen says Wollongong.  Hmm.</p>

<p>Now it's all clouds again.  I'm thankful to have
gotten to see the shore!</p>

<p>So I was saying that I saw a <em>lot</em> of little
white dots on the water, and many of them were miles
and miles out, yet still all clusterd; not sparse.. 
Could they have been boats?</p>

<pre>
500 mph
28 minutes left. 
still at 38000 feet.
</pre>

<p>but I just felt a tilt.  It didn't seem like a
downward tilt, but a turning tilt.</p>

<p>I can see on the map our tilt right that I felt a
while ago.</p>

<pre>
497 mph.
-50 C
25 minutes left. 
make that 24
38000 feet still.
</pre>

<p>We have traveled 7320 miles so far.</p>

<p class=date>9:36 am</p>

<pre>487 mph now.</pre>

<p class=date>9:57 am</p>

<p>Just now began our descent.</p>

<p>I'm turning off now; I assume they will ask us to
in a second.</p>

<p>Michael, Tom, Nick and I are watching Australian
TV.  So very not any more exciting than US TV.</p>

<p>All the girls except for Irene's mom are getting
their dresses sized.</p>

<p>Pretty quaint little house with lovely brick and
brass fireplace and low wall separating the living
room from the dining room and hallway.   Small
triangular shaped backyard, with a huge eucalyptus
(sp) tree (I think) and a little rock lined pond that
needs to be emptied of dirt and leaves.</p>

<p class=date>6:55 pm</p>

<p>We are at Nick's parent's house, where Nick's
brother Michael and I just spent an hour rolling a
golf ball back and forth on the outside table, and
then developed a game where we roll the ball with a
bowl over it, so the bowl is pushed by the ball, and
then we played roll the ball over the bowl in the
middle of the table.  then we played roll the ball and
try to make it stay on top of the inverted bowl. 
After many many many many tries, on the order of 100
or more, I got it.  So cool.  Great fun to play!</p>

<p class=date>8:49 pm</p>

<p>Talking about the myth that water in toilets
flushes the other direction in Australia, Angel said,
"it changes when you cross the International Date
Line!"</p>

<p>HAHAhahahahhaaaaa!!!!</p>

<p>We talked a lot about differences in language. 
Aussie's have something called rhyming slang:</p>

<p>Dog's eye = meat pie
<br>dead horse = tomato sauce</p>

<p>note: The letter R is mostly unspoken (like in
Boston), so "horse" rhymes with "sauce."</p>
