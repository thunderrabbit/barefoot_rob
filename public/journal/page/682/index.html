<p class=note>(above date is an educated guess)</p>

<p>Dude.</p>

<p>Last Thursday I went skating again-  my ankle was kinda messed up, but not from
skating.   I don't know what was wrong with it, but it *really* hurt by the
end of the night.</p>

<p>A guy had a small ramp set up out by Party on the Plaza.  This was super cool.
It was designed to convert all your speed into upward momentum.  :)   The 
actual ramp part of the ramp was concave, and it bowed slightly when you hit
it.   The board's bowing action, along with bending your knees slightly, 
allowed us to jump essentially straight up about 4 to 6 feet.  The first couple
of times that I tried it, I stayed cautious, and landed safely.   I tried it 
a bit faster, and went a bit higher, and ended up sliding on my wrist/palm 
pads and the toes of my skates.  (Onlookers said that I used my pads very well)
I kept it conservative again and just got the feeling of how to use the ramp
correctly.  Then I went for a big jump and *almost* ate it pretty bad.  
Luckily, I used my pads correctly again...  I jumped a few last times and my
last big jump went well.   They said I got about 5 feet of air, and I landed
properly.   Cool.</p>

<p>We also skated down a garage I had never skated before.  It's called
Biraporetti's (sp) because that is the name of the establishment at the bottom
of the building.   The garage is 13 stories tall, so it gave us a lot of time
to play on the way down.   I practiced high-speed, tight-radius turns, and 
only slid sideways once.  On one turn I *barely* squeaked past a parked truck;
My right skate went under its back bumper as I flew by.    We got to the
bottom, and I skated under the ticket booth arm thing, and then noticed that 
we were locked in the garage.  !!  The actual exit for the garage is blocked
by a steel door that opens only for cars.  So we waited for a couple minutes
until a car came down and let us out.</p>

<p>The last crazy thing I did was skate off a wall.  Okay- imagine a
building with a flat, level foundation, but with a non-level sidewalk
surrounding it.</p>

<p>So the foundation starts at one end of the block about 1 foot above the
sidewalk.  At the other end of the block, it's a bit higher.   I hopped up
onto the one foot tall side and skated along the foundation.  I figured it 
would be no problem; I had skated off this wall before.  ( I just hadn't
skated off the very *highest* point of the wall.)   So as I was approaching
the end of the wall, I got that gosh-dangit-this-is-higher-than-I-expected
feeling as I saw how high I actually was.  Now, due to the nature of how 
one lands while wearing roller blades, one doesn't have the option to stop,
reconsider, start again, then jump.   You'd be all off balance and it would
be just crazy.  Plus, there were people watching, and I was wearing my 
NO FEAR t-shirt.   So I watched as the sidewalk kept getting farther and 
farther away ...oh shit... and I got to the edge and dropped off.   
I landed straight down on my skates as I wanted to, but I got a literally
sinking feeling in my whole guts and everything and I continued to fall
forward and kinda ka-klunked onto the sidewalk.  My breath was knocked out
for a second, but I was able to get back up and continue skating.</p>

<p>I haven't gone back to see exactly how high that wall is, but it is
definitely taller than me.  My guess is that it's between 6 and 7 feet.</p>

<p>After telling this story to a few people, I have made a realization that
just because I'm wearing skates, doesn't mean that when I land, I'm 
automatically landing on pillows or anything.  There's still all that mass
smushing down on my feet and there's that momentum to ka-klunk me on the
sidewalk.</p>

<p>I took physics, and I'm finally finding an application for it.</p>

<p class=note>(I am guessing at the date above.  I know it was 1994; I know it was warm; there were fireworks.  I'm guessing it was Memorial Day.)

<p>I went skating last night all over downtown Houston.  It was pretty
darn fun.   I played on Party on the Plaza and practiced skating up
and down the steps there.  One time last night I was able to jump
entirely up about 9 steps.  Some guy said, "good job," right as I did
it.  I was impressed with that.</p>

<p>I kinda joined into a group of skaters that had also been playing on
the steps and we skated about two blocks, but they were really being
slow and indecisive about where they wanted to go.  Then two guys
skated by at high speed, so I caught up with them.  We skated into
the garage we call "Luther's" (because the building into which the
garage is built has Luther's BBQ at the bottom) and up one ramp to the
elevator.  We went up to the 10th floor and then skated down down down
down down to the 5th.  Interestingly enough, the garage seemed like
really tame to me compared to the first time I skated it several
months ago.  We hopped back onto the elevator and went back up to the
10th floor.   This time we formed a chain by grabbing the person's
beltloop and skated down that way.  I was in the back, and found it
somewhat difficult to not be slung way outside of their turning
radius.  Two times I slipped off the chain, two times I was slung
outward but held on, and the other 4 times I cut the corner inside
where they skated, so I stayed right in close.  Very cool.  Then on
about level 2, we encountered two janitorial type people.  The two
guys with whom I was skating turned right and went to the elevator
again.  I skated straight down the ramp and out of the garage,
absolutely whizzing past the guard booth (there was a guard in it).
I zipped through about a 2 foot space between his booth and the
parking garage arm thing.   &lt;ffwsshheeeeeeewwwww!!>  Heh heh.  I
rocketed out into the street and cruised back to Party on the Plaza.</p>

<p>I found Carrie and Beth (who I met at 4th of July last year) skating
around the area.  I hung out with them at the Plaza just goofing
around listening to the live band and just being crazy.  There was a
security guard patrolling the sidewalk area of a particular building,
trying to catch us to tell us that we couldn't skate there.  Whenever
he would come our way, we would skate the other direction around the
entire building until we caught up with him back where we had just
been.  It was kinda silly but funny.    When the band ended, there
were bunches of fireworks, and we were like "Cool!!  Just like when we
met the first time!"   We watched them and then cruised to the Brewery
Tap to get a drink.  (I drink water)  On the way there, a small blue
pickup truck drove somewhat slowly past us and the passenger guy
yelled, "hey wassup?" or something like that.   They were right next
to me, so I latched onto the passenger side of the bed and they pulled
me about 2.5 blocks.  That was cool (and very illeagal).  While being
pulled, I worked my way along the back of the bed and then pulled
myself forward toward the driver's side so that I was actually moving
faster than the truck when I let go and turned left to meet my friends
back at the Tap.  One experiences an interesting thing when one is
pulled on skates by a vehicle.  Normal skating speed is probably about
10 miles per hour.  Top speed for me is about 15.   So the truck
pulled me at, let's say, 20 miles per hour.  Do the physics really
quickly and determine that at 20mph, I have 4 times the amount of
kinetic energy as at 10mph.  Therefore it takes a much longer time to
stop.  Very cool.  Several pedestrians saw me as I let go, couldn't
make the turning radius to stay in the street, zipped up onto the
sidewalk instead, back down into the street between two parked cars
and then into the next block through a bank drive-through area.  Only
by that time had I reached normal skating speed again.  Whew.  I made
it.  The drive-through was dark.  Just as I was about to step up about
a 1.5 foot step out of the bank area and into a parking lot, &lt;wham> I
hit a (something solid) that I didn't see at all.  I slid on my
kneepads and then jumped myself back onto my skates (somehow) and then
continued.  Just as I was tripping over the thing, a guy shouted,
"watch your step!" heh.  I recovered and shouted, "woof!  no problem."
("woof" is like "whew" but it's easier to say it louder so people can
hear you as you skate past.) I met up with Carrie and Beth at the Tap,
and I remet the two guys with whom I had skated Luther's.   I got some
water and then we went next door to a bar called Power Tools.</p>

<p>Now, Power Tools does not sound like the kind of place that I would
normally frequent.  It was all totally crowded inside so I just
followed them to the back of the bar and actually outside to what can
be best described (after my brief glance) as Power Tools' fenced-in
concrete backyard.  We walked down the outdoor steps and then under
the building again into a much less crowded concrete floored area with
realatively plenty of room to skate and dance around.   There were
blacklights everywhere, giving clothing that glow-in-the-dark look.
There were wild weird light shows playing against the walls and loud
super low bass (mostly rap) music that vibrates everything in the
room.  We hung out down there for a while and watched people and
danced around and checked out a *big* python or boa (for some reason,
"reticulated python" comes to mind) in a big cage built into the wall
down there.  I wonder how he gets along with everything vibrating like
that.  After sufficiently resting, we skated out to Fuzzy's, another
bar.  This was rather mundane compared to Power Tools.
It was about midnight and my group started splitting up, so I cruised,
skating really fast about 12 blocks to get back to my car.  I couldn't
find it at first, but then I did, and here I am.</p>

<p>I fell asleep instead of doing a Shamanic Journey.</p>

<p class="dream">This morning I dreamnt [sic] that I was with Madonna and that she was living with
me in dad's house.  She did my laundry for me and interacted with me as friend and lover.</p>

<p>I don't remember actually kissing her, but I bet that's how I met her in the dream.</p>

<p class="dream">We flirted &amp; almost went skinny dipping in the pond behind dad's house but
there were other guys there so I didn't.  Madonna drove Fred's bug around the Peden
&quot;block&quot; <del>)</del> and almost got busted for speeding.</p>

<p class="dream">I just had a long dream about Melanie Barr we were in her room and some dudes ran
by outside naked &amp; we turned off the lights to <del>wa</del> see who it was and Melanie &amp; I
didn't kiss or anything, but she acted as if she were a much closer friend to me than in 'real'

<h1>State of my life address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>Though my sign on my wall says &quot;Stop Looking (for a girlfriend)&quot; I still kinda am
but not entirely.</p>

<p>Cathy has said no because I won't have sex.  Diana is too religiously inclined for me.  She said
she's thought about becoming a nun so she could simply serve God.</p></li>

<li><p>My camera has been stolen.  In it were pictures of Thanksgiving activities and shit.  That
really upsets me - I can't trust the UH campus as much as I'd like to.</p></li>

<li><p>I learned a new fresh frisbee move from Danny, the light dude from the band Catherine
Wheel.</p></li>

<li><p>I have read <em>Journeys Out of the Body</em> by Robert A. Monroe.  It will take much
practice, but (I see my hands therefore I am dreaming) the first step he says is to let your body
fall asleep while your brain stays awake.  So far I have only <del>succed</del> succeeded in
falling asleep with my body.  However, my dreams are either bigger or somehow more vivid or more
memorable or just all around more.  I'm not sure what it is exactly.  I don't remember my dreams
any more than normal but I have a feeling that my conscious brain knows I'm dreaming but just
doesn't remember it.  I will keep trying.</p></li>

<li><p>My house is a fucking mess but I'll get it better.  I've built or otherwise installed small
shelves.</p></li>

<li><p>I've gone CD crazy.  I'm signed up with BMG music services &amp; I signed up Heather and I
want lots of CDs.</p></li>

<li><p>The days are getting shorter.  I look forward to the approach of Fred's birthday.</p></li>

<li><p>2 More weeks of school.</p></li>

<li><p>I have really hated Database this semester.  I hope to pass.</p></li>

<li><p>Eva the babe TA with braces kissed some guy in the hall.  Fuck.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm not looking for a girlfriend - just someone to kiss.  This changes daily.</p></li>

<p>&quot;Today&quot; I wrote Lori a letter describing how I feel (impressed,
intimidated) <del>by</del> <ins>about</ins> her.  As I hugged her so big when I gave it to her, I
noticed something about her.. Later Suzanne asked if Lori had been crying when she came back down.
Crying?  suzanne said Lori misses me.  I am floored shocked amazed delighted ecstatic thrilled.  I
would never have guessed.</p>

<p>Carol, who has a cool voice said she would love to play disc golf with me out at a park near her
in Austin.  Dude.</p>

<p>I want to make a trip to Austin for a weekend sometime.</p>

<p>I did a lot of screwing around <del>fod</del> today.  I almost got all my household bills &amp;
letters to Monner &amp; rent &amp; shit taken care of.</p>

<p>Oh to be out of school...</p>

<p>Suzanne &amp; I <del>had</del> did grinding kissing sex play but the pants stayed on.</p>

<p>She gave me a tape of drum beats designed to allow one to make a Shaman Voyage into the lower
earth.  I'm going to try it now.</p>

<p class="date">4:30AM Sunday 5 December 1993 [page 44]</p>

<p>I am tired.  I read Illusions by Richard Bach today, the day of Lori's going away party which I
didn't attend because Nathan was going to be there.</p>

<p>I determined that I am intimidated by Lori and other females in their (Lori &amp; Suzanne's)
group.  My upper left jaw is fucked up.</p>

<p>I am tired.  I have been trying several times this weekend to practice astral projections,
starting with simple &quot;remain <del>conssi</del> conscious while your body sleeps. I so far have
not remained conscious.</p>

<p>I went to Ultimate and we played keep away &amp; then one game of 4 on 4.</p>

<p>I think talked to Diana (the babe) in OB &amp; she was talking to James &amp; frank.  It turns
out that Diana is a bit more religiously oriented than I want. Oh Well.</p>

<p>Then Jeanine &amp; I went to House of Pies &amp; a <del>do</del> drunk dude named Dave sang the
Barney song at two different tables.  I flirted much with Angela and when I hugged her at the very
end, she did not smell like smoke and she gripped or <del>gropped m</del> groped my bicep and she
was like, &quot;&lt;moan&gt; I better get out of here.&quot;</p>

<p>Check you Later.</p>

<p class="date">7:50PM Friday 3 December 1993 Day (Page44)</p>

<p>I have decided to not keep track of exactly what day I'm on each day.  I'll keep this pointer
back to page 44 that will tell me the last recorded day count so I can recalculate it.  The only
reason for this is that maybe the days will go by faster, not that they are going slowly now.
Heck, I don't know.</p>

<p>Wednesday after database lab ended at 6pm <del>we crui</del> I cruised to the VAX to work.
Maggie was there fucking around while John did his program.  Dave Psurney (also in database) &amp;
Steve Inman (database) &amp; I were working on SQL. Stupid fucker Hassan started SQL that night.
he hadn't attended class in weeks.  Dumb ass.</p>

<p>At 6PM Dave &amp; I were like, &quot;ok we have 18 hours.&quot; It felt like barely plenty of
time.  We worked &amp; worked &amp; I was hungry.  Maggie &amp; John cruised at 10pm &amp; brought
me 6 McDonald's hamburgers &amp; a shake.  I ate two of them immediately.</p>

<p>The VAX was incredibly slow as I was compiling my Pro*Pascal program at 10PM.  14 hours left.  I
called Heather &amp; told her I didn't know if I would be able to tutor her at 10:30AM I called
&amp; told Tanya I definitely could not type her gymnastics routine.</p>

<p>Each time I compiled my program it took a long ass time, so I would go back &amp; talk to Katy
(cutie that I met through Caleb) who was playing on a MUD &amp; working on Prob &amp; Stats.  She
cruised &amp; hugged me &amp; at one point had let me bite her (hand) &amp; wrote me a mail
message.</p>

<p>10 hours left.  Things looked bleak.  I called Heather &amp; told her.  Things better start
pulling together soon or I won't be happy.  Steve showed me how to do stuff with dates &amp; how to
put where conditions in cursor queries.  I showed him how to do labels &amp; stuff in Pascal.  He
saved me so much time that my project would have suffered severely.</p>

<p>Dave showed me how to do some shit with the last query - build a temporary table.</p>

<p>Steve cruised at 2am.</p>

<p>&quot;Dude. we have 10 hours left.&quot; &quot;I know.&quot;</p>

<p>Darell Spice left without finishing.</p>

<p>Things started pulling together.  I got all the first 9 queries working.  Then with knowelege [sic]
(sp) about how to build a temporary table I got #10 done.  Bad Ass.</p>

<p>I had finally finished my Pro*Pascal stuff after Steve had showed me the date stuff.</p>

<p>4:30AM. &quot;Dude. it's almost 5 o'clock in the morning.&quot;  &quot;Dude.&quot;  &quot;Dude
the sun is coming up!&quot;  There was a certain red glow outside but it may have just been city
lights.  At 5AM Mark Hartray stumbled in. (My old Poli Sci instructor.  ugh.)  He
looked <em>tired</em>.  heh.</p>

<p>Dave &amp; I were tired but generally optimistic &amp; getting all our stuff printed &amp;
organized &amp; talking the whole time.</p>

<p>AT 5:15 I realized Maggie was awake so I called her.  I told her that I just had one bit more to
do, but I couldn't muster enough to do it.  Sh rallied me but it didn't work.</p>

<p>We printed our stuff and got it all together.</p>

<p>&quot;Dude we've been here 8 hours.  Wait - we've been here wait we've been her [sic] fucking 12
hours.  Holy Shit.&quot;</p>

<p>I cruised and Dave had decided to do some last little stuff.</p>

<p>I ate one of the remaining 2 hamburgers on the way to my house.  I stopped by &amp; checked
everything <ins>&amp; got my key from Suzanne</ins> &amp; then went straight to Maggie's.  Rush
hour traffic was in effect.  I got there at exactly 7 as Maggie predicted &amp; I slept from 7AM to
9:30AM.</p>

<p>I met Heather at school &amp; tutored her &amp; then stayed awake in Graphics.</p>

<p>They are building new doors in PGH.  Dude.  The doors are slightly inside the current doors.</p>

<p>Marcel showed Pieroni his graphics program for 45 minutes &amp; then I typed my gymnastics
routine on his computer.</p>

<p>Christine showed up at gymnastics with a lady named Crystal.</p>

<p>I was the first to do the final routine.  I sat between Heather &amp; Laura to watch the rest.
Chris was really graceful &amp; beautiful.  Andy's was fresh &amp; required strength (which I was
unable to deliver being so tired)</p>

<p>I didn't make my first attempt at press to handstand so I barely made it when i tried again.
When I didn't get all the way to the corner of the floor I started making up shit to get there.
(One arm cartwheel &amp; something else.)  At the corner I had a long pause to make sure I had the
energy to pull of [sic] a round off back flip.  Barely.  So I exerted the hell out of myself to do
it &amp; i got it.  Bad Ass.</p>

<p>After all the routines, it was fuck around time.</p>

<p>I played &amp; talked to Christine &amp; goofed around.  Me Wasseim &amp; Aaron did some fun
trampoline stuff.  The game was to jump over the low uneven bar Then <del>wc</del> we high jumped it
&amp; then we put it on the high uneven bar spot.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/File:Page_50_Book_Six_snippet_3_December_1993.jpg"><img src="/w/images/4/47/Page_50_Book_Six_snippet_3_December_1993.jpg"
alt="springboards, tramp, tramp, highbar"/></a></p>

<p>We had this set up at one point.  We would jump jump jump &amp; fly to the bar and catch it.
Wasseim &amp; I would catch it backwards (I did it first) sometimes.  Cool.</p>

<p>I watched The Muppets Take Manhattan in the Houston Room &amp; <del>some</del> a female behind
me smelled really good but she wasn't exactly gorgeous.</p>

<p>On the way back to the dorms I saw Jessica (from The Hammock) &amp; Chris (SPB) &amp; Dawn
(Fountain) &amp; Elizabeth (Taub) setting up sound equipment by the wading fountain.  The band
didn't exactly show up so it became open mic.</p>

<p>Brad &amp; Fred &amp; I did a <del>barp</del> <del>burping</del> belching contest &amp;
entertained a bit.  Fred &amp; I did the bowling thing - It's been like 6 years since I saw (heard)
that done by Andy in high school.  Dude.  Fred &amp; I had never before gotten the chance to do
it.</p>

<p>Then I sat down by a girl named Amanda -wait.</p>

<p>I lay back on Dawn &amp; told her to bite me &amp; she didn't.  She teased me.  She said
&quot;here?&quot; &quot;it's been a long time since I've bitten anyone.&quot; &lt;Whimper&gt; She
teased me.</p>

<p>Then I sat down by a girl named Amanda who had stopped to listen while walking by.  I talked to
her a bit and asked if she wanted to perform for us.  She didn't but was content to listen.</p>

<p>A dude that just walked by sang &amp; gave us food from some party.  (cookies &amp; chips)</p>

<p>Then after no one was on the mic, I walked slowly up there.  I took the mic &amp; stood silently
for a moment &amp; then began.  I did Bill Cosby stuff - Taking a bath in the toilet - Chris had
the reverb on really loud - about 2 seconds apart for about 5 echoes.  That could be obnoxious, but
it forced me to slow down &amp; let the echo die down before I continued, thus allowing me time to
think &amp; collect my next sentence &amp; made my routine a bit funnier I think.</p>

<p>I also allowed me to hear myself to see how I was doing (well) and gave me confidence (I was
funny!)</p>

<p>I did Bill Cosby's thing on golf, (a stupid game) an a bit from the roadside sign one that Fred
does.</p>

<p>I was funny.  I did Bill Cosby's Fat Albert airplane cessna engine car.  I was funny.  Cool Cool
Cool.</p>

<p>Then the 5 echo long repeat thing made a very cool thing possible.  We had 5 microphones &amp;
people all making little random noises in each one.  Then big noises &amp; phrases &quot;Shut up
Lew!&quot; growls - it was fantastic - I really really wanted to record it - I <del>bit it</del>
bet it could be sold as music. <del>(Not</del> Not a whole CD of that, but a good 10 minutes.
Dawn's voice was beautiful on it - her little sighs &amp; whimpers &amp; moans &amp; hums &amp;
noises for which there is no name were fantastic Enigma type stuff.</p>

<p>We did that for at least an hour.  I really would love a recording of it.</p>

<p>On the way out through Taub, I stopped by Britt's &amp; sat by her on her bed &amp; she was not
pleased with Scott in general, but he was there studying.  She made my day by holding my arm as I
was beside her.  I loved it.</p>

<p>I got to bed Thursday night at about midnight.  So I got 2.5 hours of sleep in 38.75 hours.
Cool.</p>

<p>This morning (Friday) Laura came over at about 7 AM &amp; tried to sleep though she had taken
Vivarin.  I cuddled &amp; smooched on her and stuff.  We did some crotch grinding, but nothing
more.</p>

<p>She cruised &amp; I wrote my report for project 2 Database.  I drove to school specifically to
turn it in &amp; I came back &amp; slept for 3 hours.  Now here I am.</p>

<p>I thought of a funny thing to say on someone's answering machine.  &quot;HI.  This is Rob.  It's
1:27 and I wait it's 1:29 1:30 oh - that's my CD player...&quot;</p>

<p>Check you later.</p>

<p class="date">9:45 AM Wednesday 1 December 1993 Day 68</p>

<p class="dream">Last night I had a dream.  I was walking with 4 or 5 different girls.  I had been
working in a Target-like store and there was a beautiful female customer and I asked her if there
was anything I could do for her.  Anything.  She told me that her new job was skydiving.  I fell at
her feet and began to kiss her feet.  Then she was sucking my balls and licking and it was
orgasmic.</p>

<p class="dream">Then I was walking with 4 or 5 different girls and french kissing each of them in
turn.  Each of them watched as I kissed the others and they all wanted to kiss and kiss.</p>

<p class="dream">Then there were 3 brothers sitting cross legged &amp; they were Buddhist (sp) and
they thought themselves into flight.</p>

<p class="dream">Then there was a huge box of lids from the pharmacy that were being recycled.
There were so many that they were sorted by color &amp; still filled several huge containers.
Then there was an organization like SPB and they recycled all the lids.</p>

<p class="date">2:30AM Wednesday 1 December 1993 [Day 68]</p>

<p>&quot;Today&quot; I had trouble waking up since I was so tired.</p>

<p>After graphics, we ate lunch.</p>

<p>Today was our gymnastics finals, up for which Christine showed.  I did a perfect vault by my
standards and a pretty crummy parallel bar routine.</p>

<p>I ended up with a bar burn on my arm.</p>

<p>I spotted some of the girls on their balance beam routines.  Heather spanked my ass when I was
leaning over on the beam.</p>

<p>I tutored Tanya for 3 hours and she fed me &amp; gave my [sic] 5 bucks per hour.  At the end of
our time, a dude gave us each a <ins>Pizza Hut personal size</ins> pizza since they
were <del>leaving</del> closing for the day.  Cool.</p>

<p>I worked on SQL &amp; I should be able to finish it.</p>

<p>We showed off our graphics projects.  The presentation was absolutely stupid.</p>

<p>The specification of the project is designed to manipulate &amp; rotate 3 dimensional objects in
space &amp; project them &amp; perform hidden line, &amp; hidden surface removal.</p>

<p>The presentation said draw a fucking 2-D pussy Christmas tree &amp; rotate it about its axis
&amp; end up with intersecting surfaces &amp; all sorts of shit.</p>

<p>In class we were told not to worry about plane intersection problems - that they would not occur
in our projects.</p>

<p>How</p>

<p>Stupid.</p>

<p>There are just so many better things they could have had our projects do.  It
was <del>shittl</del> shitty.</p>

<p>I wrote a long e-mail message about my skating adventure &amp; mailed it to everyone.</p>
