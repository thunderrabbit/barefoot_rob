<p class=date>9:56pm CDT Wednesday 4 April 2001</p></p>

<p>Ultimate started at 8:30pm tonight.  I took a break from working on
investment club stuff to go play.  As I arrived at the field, the
lights were off, but about 15 of the ultimate guys were standing
around in the parking lot.  For some unknown reason, the lights
weren't working.</p>

<p>Just after I arrived, it was determined that we had waited long
enough to caravan to a different field.  I considered carpooling with
someone, but chose not to.  I'm glad, because...</p>

<p>The field was full of briars!  crab grass, stickers, whatever one
wants to call them, they totally hurt!  My feet are still burning a
little bit, and I left 15 minutes ago.</p>

<p>Despite the agony, I ran thoroughly for some points.  Somehow I'm
able to stand the pain for brief bursts, running across the stickers.
It's more painful when I'm just walking across them.  I can't explain
why.  My last two points played were great.  I tossed one in for a
point caught by Bad Like Mike, and I shared catching a point with
Matt Last Back Napsack.  I wasn't sure that I'd be able to catch it;
we were pretty well covered, but not well enough.  Matt and I both had
a secure hold on the disc.  1/2 point each was declared.</p>

<p>Victorious enough for me.. and I winced off the field to remove
stickers and go home.</p>

<p class=date>8:33am CDT Monday 2 April 2001</p></p>

<p>Dropped off Sarah at Emerson Church while we were designing the
rules to Silent Moose Balls.  (I may write up the rules to Silent
Football, Silent Foot Ball and Silent Moose Balls on this site.)
Sarah's dad came to pick her up just a few minutes after we arrived.</p>

<p>Then to Phat Pat's house to drop him off.  There was a guy on a
motorcycle with some bars attached to another motorcycle driving down
the street, fully as wide as a car.  Weird.</p>

<p>Got home and it was hot in the house, like 82 or 84 degrees inside,
and I had a headache.  The cats were all keeled over sleeping in the
way that makes Wende and I joke, "uh-oh, the cat is dead."  I put all
my junk away (I was so tempted to just "do it later," but I knew Wende
would do it when she got home, and I didn't want her to have to pick
up after me.) and then took a relatively cold shower.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I was knocked out dead sleeping when suddenly Wende was right over
me, saying HI.  I hadn't heard the garage door open and close, nor the
house alarm being unset/reset or the cats hollering at her or
anything.  Wow.</p>

<p>Hug and kiss and back to sleep.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>This morning she left around 7 and set the alarm for 9am at my
request.  I finally was able to wake up for real around 8:30, with
memories of a dream that has since escaped my brain.</p>

of entries to keep it with the rest of the Plano
Rally)</p>

<p class=date>5:09 am 01 April 2001</p>

<p>It's actually 6:09 am because of daylight savings
time change.   I'm pretty tired-ish.  The game was
great fun, but most of all, I'm thankful to the
faithful recording job done mostly by Lisa/Magenta,
with the last part recorded by Heidi and Sean.    I
don't know if it will be apparent where the change in
typist occurred.</p>

<p>I'm going to bed.</p>

<p class=date>8:12am</p>

<p>That was freaky to just now wake up and be in an
empty room. Everyone else has moved all their  stuff
out of this room, leaving me sleeping on the
table.</p>

<p>(I started out sleeping on the table, so that part
was not surprising.  Just waking up in the empty room
was surprising.)</p>

<p class=date>8:34 am</p>

<p>We're at IHOP now; I'm at Katie L, Lawren, and
Michael A's table.</p>

<p class=message>I'm Katie
<br>See i have this great story about how i was almost
left in San Antonio.  See I wanted to wash my hair so
i showed up to church a little late.  We wanted to
leave at 7:00 and i got there at 6:55.  But when my
dad and i got there no-one was there.  So we tried to
call Steve's cell-phone but we had the wrong number. 
So i was about to cry and then Hillary Feinstein
called the church.  My dad answered the phone and she
said that they had forgotten me and they were coming
back to get me.  See Hillary had wanted to listen to a
song that i had and the she was like, 'Oh shit! We
forgot Katie!'  So they came back to get me and when
they got there they tried to play it off by saying
'April fools!' and i was like 'You all can suck my
ass.'   And then when we were in Waco we stopped at
this place that we always stop at and i was like now
don't forget me here. But they couldn't anyway because
i had the van key.  So now everythings all gravy
baby!!</p>

<p class=message>Hey it's Lawren, who rox the
house!</p>

<p>We each paid $10 for $30.46 meal.  I don't know who
paid the 46 cents, but I know we left $10 on the table
for tip.</p>

<p>I slept pretty much all the way home.  Susie (Katie
and Meg's mom) drove our van back.  Jeff drove the
Yukon back.</p>

<p>After we got back to Emerson church, cleaned out
the vans and stuff, I drove Phat Pat and Sarah home. 
During that ride, Phat Pat said we should invent a
version of Silent Football for the car.  In 45
minutes, this is what we came up with:</p>

<pre>
Silent Moose Balls
 est. 4-1-2001    2:48pm

This version of the game is designed to  be played in
the car, or any place where the players are unable to
see each other.

The concept is that we are playing on Animal Farm. The
Farmer can be called any variation of an animal worker
(vet, rancher, farmer) then any color, then any
animal.   The silent football is actually a cow patty.

The Farmer begins and ends each round.  

Players may move the cow patty with four offensive
moves, the fwap, the zoom, the fwizap and the foom. 
By speaking "Yellow Bluejay fooms the cow patty to
Frying Flying Squirrel."

No pronouns, including personal pronouns while moving
the cow patty.

To refuse the cow patty, there are four words:  No,
False, Inaccurate, and Not.   To refuse the refusal,
the words are Yes, True, Accurate, and Anti-Not,
respectively.

Animals can be real or mythical, including all
mythical creatures such as Leprechauns, Sasquatch,
Easter Bunny, and Santa Claus.

<p>I've been pretty good with name recognition after
perusing the Houston Rally 2001 mugbook  earlier
today.</p>

<p>The ride up here was pretty simple.  We stopped
once for P purposes and then I got wacked out when
Wende called me just as I was about to take 75 and was
like, 'no don't take 75; take 35!'   I got off track
therefore and we stopped at a gas station to see where
 we were supposed to go.  I was right.  75 goes in to
Plano.</p>

<p>In fact, I remembered exactly how to get here!</p>

<p>I'm actually getting pretty tired; I don't know if
I'll stay up for opening circle.</p>

<p>Of course I will.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Now, thanks to Eliiizabeth for shaving my
hair!!</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I showed Sean the magic color changing frisbee and
had him guess at how it's magic.  He will certainly be
in awe tomorrow.</p>

<p class=date>2:57 am</p>

<p>At opening circle now:</p>

<p>Sean:  'We are the Gnarly Gnats!'</p>

<p>Crowd:  yayy!!!

<p>Ryan: 'But  Gnat starts with a G!'

<p>Sean: so does Gnarly!

<p>Crowd:  OOoooooohhhhhhhahahahahahaah!!

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Frank Roesler speaking for Matt with Matt's arms 
under Frank's armpits beng funny.</p>

<p class=date>3:40 am</p>

<p>We are in touchgroups  now and have played the
describe-your-scars  game.  Now we are doing a brown
bag skit - we receive a bag of some random objects and
have to make a skit that uses them all.</p>

<p>For the  record, I am really fuckin' tired.</p>

<p class=date>4:13 am</p>

<p>These skits are  widely varied and  entirely
wack.</p>

<p class=date>4:28 am</p>

<p>We just did our skit.  I was a gypsy, apparently
female at first until I removed the crystal ball from 
under my shirt..  "Thanka there!"  my voice turned
gruff,  "the crystal ball was kiinda squishin' the
packaging.."</p>

<p class=date>4:31 am</p>

<p>Bedtime for me now.   Yay skits!!</p>

<p>I've been up about 15 minutes.  Cassie asks, "is
your entire life on that thing?"  and she says:</p>

<p class=message>lots of things.  Mostly that I'm
getting sleep deprived and I had no idea you could
miss computers and typing as much as I do.  This thing
is much harder to type on though.  This rally is muy
cold.  (I've forgotten the spanish word, oh well.) 
Before I start pouring out everything that's happened
in the last oh, day, I'll give this back to Rob.</p>

<p>'Frio,' I remind her.</p>

<p>Steve asks if I am taking notes of people's 
conversations.</

<p>kevin F says:</p>

<p class=message>Hey Rob, how goes it? Alls well
here!!
Look forwARD from hearing you soon, write
________@yahoo.com</p>

<p class=date>10:42 am</p>

<p>Social Action was cleanup of the nearby elementary
school.  However, there was very little trash on the
yard.  Most of the youth played on the playground and
I helped Cassie and Steve collect some scrap metal.

<p>Then I played on the equipment, doing hip circles
and one knee circles (gymnastics), and a small luge
and climbing up the slide and remembering Jena's full
name.</p>

<p class=date>11:33 am</p>

<p>Outside by the big field I engaged in preliminary
discussion with Annie, Ryan, Lilly, Sean, me about
power shuffle.  I think we will all come to a mutual
agreement!</p>

<p>now ultimate!</p>

<p class=date>6:37 pm

<p>The field was pretty treacherous on my feet.  I
have just now washed them and I can feel the sting
from a small gash on the arch of my foot.</p>

<p>We played ultimate for about 1 hour only I'm
guessing.  Super sunny and  absolutely perfect
weather.  the field was mostly covered in grass, but a
few thistles and some sections of reeds that really
stabbed my feet when I ran through them.</p>

<p>Everyone played well, especially Hillary, who
caught at least 4 or 5 points in the endzone!</p>

<p>(hhaha!!  Someone just said 'false' while wrasslin'
around in the hall!  Yay false!)

<p>We have just had 4 or 5 hours of YAC meeting.  My
last one of the year.  This meeting was punctuated
with uproar about The Power Shuffle at SWUUSI (we
decided to make it every other year, and proactively
work to convince the district board that it's a great
thing) and disrespect issues, starring Elizabeth and
Christina.  I think all of that is worked out (until
we get to OKC rally at which they both may be.)</p>

<p>Sean Bibby has been acting weird just after the
meeting.  He was hiding something from me; I wonder
what they have planned......  I'm excited!!  :-)</p>

<p class=message>aww yeah you know we got something
planned for you!!</p>

<p class=message>this rally has  bee totally cool. i
have had so many positive conversations! yeah positive
conversations with people who diagree with you. soooo
rad to ----(just phuufed sev.)----- have your mind
changed for all the right reasons. ---sean b.</p>

<p>The phuufing indicated above is apparently
Elizabeth's first in YRUU, and she's a senior!</p>

<p class=date>7:49 pm 31-3-01

<p>YAC elections now, and Sean and Laura and Rick just
presented a cool ass Magic Rob briefcase with happy
notes in it from the YAC.  Wow!  For 4 years of YAC
service, a lovely magic briefcase!  That is totally
tight!  <em>And</em>, Robbie gave me his rallly shirt
that he painted 'Rob' on.  So fun!</p>

<p>Laura C showed me how to braid with 4 strands of
pipe cleaners.  I got about 1/3 way done with a length
of pipe cleaners and got lost in the colors and links.
 Laura finished it for me.</p>

<p class=message>Rob's little pipe cleaner thingy (or
at least as far as he got on it) looked better than
mine did. -laura  :)</p>

<p>Ridiculous!</p>

<p class=date>8:35 pm</p>

<p>In the cry-room adjacent the sanctuary, with
singing occasionally fed through the speaker, and
Beastie Boys 'Girls' played outside, I read all the
written votes while Sean verified I read them
correctly and Elizabeth and Karen tallied the votes. 
I was correct on predicting who would win: ashley
jackie richard</p>

<p class=date>9:01 pm</p>

<p>Bittersweet feelings in my being as I'm chillin'
before my last YAC meeting.  This will be relatively
short  - it's the turnover meeting, after which
Elizabeth and I will play Silent Football, and maybe
Silent Foot Ball.</p>

<p class=date>10:45 pm</p>

<p>Wow.  YAC is  embarking on their new tenure, and I
am no longer on YAC.</p>

<p class=date>12:03 am

<p>Elizabeth and Chris (Mr Sexy)  and  Rebecca (Miss
Snowcone) and I (Thunder Rabbit) played Silent
Football with Elizabeth as dictator.</p>

<p>The game was in  the corner of the hallway  of
Plano church aand wwas odd ecause  she alllowed us to
fwap either direction and  and we could look outside
the circle.</p>

<p>During the game, Laura gave me a note and got me a
bag to make as a note bag thing.</p>

<p>After the game,  I had 1/2 + 1/10 penance points
for a total of 3/5ths of a penance point.</p>

                        <p>I basically slept entirely through worship.  I'm
sad that I missed Heidi's and Laura's poetry.  They
each asked me how I liked it.  I had to admit, "I was
asleep."</p>

<p>Here are quotes from the Silent Football game, as
typed by Lisa, dressed as Magenta from Rocky Horror. 
Except at the end where Sean and Heidi did some
transcription.</p>

<p class=date>2:05 am</p>

<p>Nick says, "but Rob, I'm tired!!!"</p>

<p>Ryan: "Woah  someone's tired.  let's rethink this
thing."</p>

<p class=date>2:46 am</p>

<p>45 mins to explain the rules.</p>

<p>"What my sadly, sadly ignorant counterpart has
failed to notice, is that '(fist of empowerment)'  was
not a zoom,  but a fist of empowerment, and  I
reinterate, '(fist of empowerment.)"  -- Mr.
Incarnation of Evil in the Universe</p>

<p>"Miss LaUUren  is astounded at the amount of dick
in this universe."</p>

<p>"The player know as Incarnation of Evils of the
universe, can be known as Mr. 1 to Jaquelin, Mr.2 to
Kristen, Mr.  3 to Magenta, etc."</p>

<p>"Mr. Dictator can say 'muchos gracias' instead of
'thank you' when thanking a player."</p>

<p>"In situations when Mr. Dictator is making comments
during other people's comments, Mr Dictator is allowed
to use pronouns, because in such cases it is funny.
Duh."</p>

<p>"Miss Llama suggests to compensate for the large
amount of dick in the universe by changing Miss
LaUuren's name to Miss Vagina."</p>

<p>"Mr.  D suggests that Number 6 should be limited to
the 10 word rule, to thus stop the spreading of the
spreading of his cloven-hoof diesease.  (It was
noticed that Mr. D used the pronoun 'his')"</p>

<p>"Miss Llama likes ball play. Miss Llama misses ball
play and Miss Llama wants the ball playing to
begin."</p>

<p>"Mr. Dictator, can we give them tranquilizers?"</p>

<p>"Ok, he's bending my shit."</p>

<p>"Mr. D. is concerned by the growing number  of
Vageeganists."</p>

<p>"Miss Llama is having to seek entertainment through
Miss Vageegan through lack of ball play."</p>

<p>"I was  blessed as a young boy with a third eye and
I can see thrice what the normal member can see."</p>

<p class=date>3:46 am</p>

<p>The game has finally begun</p>

<p>"Miss Vageengan would like to point out that in 
the past  dicks and vaginas have been friends."</p>

<p>"Miss Vageengan would like to comment that one
should not eat a lot of honey and V8, at the same
time."</p>

<p class=date>4:04 am</p>

<p>The game resumed after another spell of debating
commenced.</p>

<p>"Mister Vageegan , Mr. Dictator, Miss Vageegan, is
dyslexic."  pronounced 'dicks'lexic</p>

<p>"I would like to point out the irony in the last
ball play, when Mister Lady Sleepy Jesus continually
tried to enter Miss Vageegan, who continuaall
refused."
'nailed'</p>

<p>(Ms,Lama's crying consoled by Mr. Bad Guys suckling
of Ms.Lama's  tits)
<br>Mr.Bibster'ss nerous breakdown followed by
touching  (literally) reunion
7/15ths penance points awarded to sean.</p>

<p>lama and no. 7 are making some weird noises over
there!!--sean (prospective mating calls)--Heidi</p>

<p>several  times the zoom has ended up with nooo
advance of the  football but only with hilarious
reprocussions-sean</p>

<p>mr incarnation of the universe is limited to only 8
words</p>

<p>ms. kristan randomly thinks that mr. dick (ben)
looks like tom hanks....no one confirms
this.......</p>

<p>except my sister...ms. josephine.. mr. dick is now
to be known as mr. tom hank's dick!! haha -sean double
haha-heidi</p>

<p>blown kisses exchanged btw Ms. Vagegan and Ms. Lama
genious</p>

<p>ms lama and ms vagen exchange a rattle from their
half empty M&M bottles after every move hey make.</p>

<p>multiple jokes about tom hank's dick</p>

<p>ms lama is a cry baby</p>

<p>mr.bad guy's expulsion of 'die' towrds Mr.
Dictator</p>

<p>ryan loses again.</p>

<p>i personally enjoyed wearing my 3rd eye hat and
zooming with one of my 3 eyes closed!! what  a blast.
my sister and kristen (fort worth) had a good first
game. kinda boring at first but then it was one of my
fav.</p>

<p>ryan says that he loses on purpose because thats
his place in the game.</p>

<p>but he still lost.</p>

Subject: oh, yeah
   From: my brother</p>

<p>Happy birthday, jughead.  That is, happy 11,323rd day
anniversary.
Some time ago you asked what the status of my major is
so you&rsquo;d know
what to tell people.  For future reference, if you
forget, just say
any damn thing, and it probably won&rsquo;t be too far from
the truth.
However, for the record, here&rsquo;s the story:</p>

<p>Highlights              Details</p>

<hr />

<p>UH: 92-96, BS math      U of Houston; less fun overall
than HS; made
                        many friends who remain close.</p>

<p>UNT: 96-99, MS math     U of North TX in Denton, TX;
actually spent
                        Fall of 1997 at NM State U in
Las Cruces,
                        but left because I hated the
administration
                        (even more than I hated UH&rsquo;s
administration);
                        had more fun at UNT than
anywhere else to date.</p>

<p>Georgia Tech:           GA Institute of Technology;
did math
Summer 99               consulting for an ME guy;
Georgia Tech has the
                        prettiest campus I&rsquo;ve ever
been to.</p>

<p>Stanford: 99-01,        The Bay Area is expensive as
fuck, but I love
MS mech. eng.           this area more than anywhere
else I&rsquo;ve ever
                        lived except Boston &ndash; I refer
to Palo Alto as
                        The Promised Land; Stanford is
the only school
                        that has challenged me, and it
put me in my
                        place; made a couple of
friends who will
                        remain close; financial aid
came entirely from
                        student loans and credit
cards.</p>

<p>?????: 01-05?,          U of Chicago                 ?</p>

<p>PhD math                Berkeley<br />
denied
                        Carnegie Mellon University<br />
denied
                        Stanford                     ?
                        Ohio State University<br />
accepted
                        UT-Austin                    ?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to go visit Ohio State next week; I&rsquo;ll say
hi to Pete for
you.</p>

<p>I am thrilled!  I have completed and moved online the version 1.1 of the
G360 project survey and it is now hosting two completely distinct surveys!
This is a total first for us here at work.  We've needed this type of tool
for a long time.</p>

<p>I'm even doubly thrilled that today begins Plano Rally!</p>

<p>I will probably be awake for 14 more hours, including a 5 hour drive to
get to the church and then we'll hang out talk talk talk talk tlakt tkla
talk talkt tkalt talk talk until 4 am or so.  Some peeps won't go to sleep
then, but I usually do - around 4 am the first night.</p>

<p>The second night is a different story.  After worship, then after talent
show, Silent Football.  And I will introduce Silent Foot Ball to everyone
who is interested!  We will probably be up until 6am or so- just in time for
cleanup on Sunday morning.</p>

<p>But the most unique thing about this rally - it will be my last rally as
an adult on YAC (Youth-Adult Committee).  I've served on YAC four years; it
is certainly time for a break.  We do have a small YAC meeting, but mostly I
won't be involved.  I'm mostly not involved anyway; the youth do all the
work; the adults just offer support where needed.</p>

<p>Super great!!</p>

<p class=date>4:38pm CST Thursday 29 March 2001</p></p>

<p>Laura IMed me today and said that she created an online journal
because she was inspired by mine!  Just yesterday Hillary said she
started a journal because she was inspired by me and Laura!</p>

<p>I checked out their respective journals on livejournal.com (I
think) and saw a few interesting aspects to them.  The entries have a
"mood indicator" and a "current music" tag thing.  That appeals to me
in a way, yet I don't want to lose my journal's uniqueness (not that
keeping a journal is particularly unique) and then I realize, dammit -
I'm thinking in terms of being the star of my own little Truman Show
here.</p>

<p>If it were my written journal, and I were writing not knowing that
anyone might see it, I might just add a mood indicator.  However, my
mood indicator is mostly included in what I write.  More curse words =
crappier mood.  More happy words = happier mood.</p>

<p>So what items might I enjoy having that livejournal has?  Oh - I
know.. They have the ability to view the entries all on one page (my
current setup does that well enough), OR to view a "calendar"
view.</p>

<p>But you know, the calendar view would be pretty tricky to code, and
even the calendar view they offer doesn't show titles in the days, but
just a number of entries from that day.  One thing that I've wanted to
add to mine is for the prev and next buttons to span across months.
Right now they are stuck in the current month and can't "see" the next
or previous month if it exists.  All the entries for a month are
stored in a single directory, so they would have to calculate what the
previous(next) directory name should be and search for the last(first)
entry in that directory.  Shouldn't be toooo difficult to write.</p>

<p>You know - By my normal rating, I've had a pretty productive day
at work, but as I was leaving, I got this overwhelming feeling of "oh
my god that fucking sucked to have been cooped up all day!"  This
sucks shit!</p>

<p>I said "hola" and "que paso" to the spanish speaking guy on the
other side of the fence from our parking lot, but I couldn't really
think of anything smart to say past that so I didn't.  As soon as I
got in my car, all these appropriate spanish phrases came to mind.
Dammit.  Next time I see him, I'll yack in spanish with him.</p>

<p>I'm chillin' for a bit before I go to Dude's house to help him set
up his linux box today.</p>
