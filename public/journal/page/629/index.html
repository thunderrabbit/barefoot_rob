<p><p>Probably the coolest most imminent unknown in my life is around work:  I&rsquo;m going to be meeting with my bosses tomorrow to discuss me shifting to a full time position, with paid medical benefits!  The unknown part is my salary.  How much do I want?  How much do I think I&rsquo;m worth?</p>

<p><p>I can start by calculating my hourly wage out to 40 hours per week.  I&rsquo;m not in the mood right now to put all the numbers on my site (I&rsquo;ve done it before), but I am happy with the resulting number, and it will allow me to pay me and Wen&rsquo;s house payment!</p>

<p><p>But then&hellip; there&rsquo;s one more thing.. Work might pay for DSL to my house!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   So awesome!!!!!!  And I&rsquo;m not talking wussy ADSL, but low to moderate SDSL with a netopia router that can put me on VPN (Virtual Private Network) with our work network!</p>

<p><p>The best part about DSL is that it&rsquo;ll save me and Wen big dollars on 2 phone lines for modem, or on DSL, and we can put both computers on the network.  Awww yeah.</p>

                        <p><title>Weekend</title>
<p class=date>10:37pm CST Monday 27 March 2000</p></p>

<p><p>This weekend was pretty full for both Wende and me.  Saturday
morning she worked 10am to 6pm.  During that time I played Ultimate in
the <a href="https://www.strayconesports.com">H.U.R.L.</a> tournament,
which we barely won by 1 point and I scraped up my knee pretty well.
After that, to work I went and wrote Valuation Statements for the
investment club.  Then investment club meeting at UH and then home for
a quick rest, then to Kroger for salad fixin&rsquo;s, and then Wende came
home and we both went to Maggie and John&rsquo;s house for big yummy Twin
Birthday celebration for Maggie and Molly!!!</p>

<p><p>Instead of purchasing cards for them, I drew them each one.
Maggie&rsquo;s said on the front, &ldquo;Ignore the message inside this card.&rdquo; On
the inside it said &ldquo;Ignore the message on the front of this card.&rdquo;  On
the back it said, &ldquo;HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!&rdquo;  and &ldquo;pay attention to this
message.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Molly&rsquo;s had, &ldquo;Hurry!  Open this card!&rdquo; on the front, and
&ldquo;Hurry!  Close this card!&rdquo; on the inside.  On the back it said,
&ldquo;Hurry! Paste this in your scrapbook!&rdquo; along with &ldquo;HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Then we came across a great idea and even drew them different cards
as well.  Basically, &ldquo;Dear Maggie: We designed a birthday celebration
just for you!  Happy Burp-Day!!!&rdquo;  For Molly it was &ldquo;Happy Bite-Day!!&rdquo;
Very appropriate for the silly lovely twins.</p>

<p><p>Somewhere during the evening, Meredith gave me a verbal
gift/blessing.  Basically that she saw my relationship with Wende as
super great and that she was excited and proud of me for settling
down.  I greatly appreciated her insight and truth.</p>

<p><p>It was super late when Wende and I went home.</p>

<p><p>- - - - - - -</p>

<p><p>On Sunday, Wende chose to skip church, and we instead visited the
beach!  She and I had not been to the beach in such a long time.  We
had never been alone.</p>

<p><p>The loveliest part of the day was watching Wende fly the kite that
Meredith and Eric gave me.  (OH!!  Meredith and Eric also gave me a
kite yesterday (Saturday)!!)  Wende said that she doesn&rsquo;t remember
ever having flown a kite as a kid or ever!  She was so <em>cute</em>
like a little kid with a new toy..  Frolicking and danicing with her
new pet kite.  I felt so in love with her.  I&rsquo;m so in love with
Wende!!</p>

<p><p>After the kite entertainment, we lay down on towels.
Unfortunately, lovely Wende has a lovely pink sunburn on her feet,
legs and chest.  This actually reminds me of when I first met her; she
had a sunburn and I got to rub aloe vera on her back.</p>

<p><p>We drove 80 miles from Galveston to Maggie and John&rsquo;s again on
Sunday.  This time to help them move their pool table.  That sucker is
heavy!!!  We took it apart at their storage unit, carried it a piece
at a time to John&rsquo;s and Will&rsquo;s trucks, then a piece at a time up the
stairs at their house.  We put the slates back onto the table surface,
but they&rsquo;ll have to hire someone else to level them.</p>

<p><p>That&rsquo;s my short written version of my great weekend!!</p>

<p><p>Ultimate was great fun today; our team won!  Barely barely we won..
We had an 8 to 4 lead at one point, and won 10 to 9.  The game had to
be cut a bit short because it was taking so long for us to get points.
Normal game is to 13.</p>

<p><p>During the game, I skinned my knee, made a couple of good throws,
and a couple of not good misses.  I did not handle the disc much.</p>

<p><p>Now it&rsquo;s time for our investment club meeting!  I just prepared
Valuation Statement for the club, and this will be our first regular
meeting.</p>

<p><p>Tonight the gang celebrates Maggie and Molly&rsquo;s birthday at Maggie and John&rsquo;s house!</p>

<p><p>Oh!! One more thing!  Manda sent me a fun URL!  <a

<p><p>The twins&rsquo; birthday celebration is tomorrow!  They&rsquo;ll be 28 and 7 days
old!!  Happy Birthday Maggie and Molly!!</p>

<p><p>Today is my cousin Pete&rsquo;s birthday and Cordie&rsquo;s birthday!  Pete is 31.
 Cordie is like 70?  She&rsquo;s my dad&rsquo;s mom.  Happy birthday!!</p>

<p><p>My big day is coming up on May 6th.  I&rsquo;ll be exactly 11,000 days old!!
 I didn&rsquo;t hugely celebrate my 10,000 day anniversary; I didn&rsquo;t recognize
then how <em>totally</em> much cooler it is to celebrate days instead of
years.</p>

<p><p>By celebrating days old, we get many benefits:</p>

<p><p>1) The parties would be scattered around the calendar.  No longer would
someone&rsquo;s celebration <em>Always</em> be on Christmas, or always on
Halloween, or even always in winter, spring, summer, autumn.  We&rsquo;d get to
mix it up some!</p>

<p><p>2) We are encouraged to count and appreciate each day.  Not just each
year, but each day.  (Maybe once this catches on, my great grandkiddo will
write, &ldquo;we should celebrate <em>hours</em> old!&rdquo;  I&rsquo;ll let him/her come up
with reasons why.)</p>

<p><p>3)  More parties!!
<ol type=a>
<li>We can have a small party every 100 days.  Very small - like a verbal
congrats from peers.
<li>Every 500 days, Maybe a card and balloons, free lunch or dinner.
<li>Every 1000 days, we&rsquo;re getting a bit bigger - paid day off from work,
free tune-up on car, back massage, and lots of ice cream.
<li>Every 10,000 days is the monster party!!!  This happens once every 27
years and 5 months.  People would probably only have 3 or 4 of these ever!!
 The celebration includes hot air balloon ride, trip around the world, meet
favorite actor or actress, ..  big crazy huge celebration for weeks!
</ol></p>

<p><p>See?  And you can find out how many days old you (or your homies) are
right <a href="/days/00about.html"><em>here!</em></a></p>

                        <p><title>House Inspection</title>
<p class=date>3:46pm CST Thursday 23 March 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Oh My God.</p>

<p><p>My being is a clamour of energy and weariness, physical and mental.
Emotionally I&rsquo;m so joyfully thankful for everyone&rsquo;s help with the
inspection, yet I feel sadness that my house is not perfect.  The
house is great, not perfect.  Each time someone would say, &ldquo;hey,
notice this over here&hellip;&rdquo;  I almost felt like they were pointing out
something wrong with <em>me</em>, or with my choice in homes.</p>

<p><p>There were 3 professional inspectors - one for termites, one for
structural integrity, and one for mechanical integrity.  There were 3
others - Diane our realtor, plus my dad and his um, friend Karen.
Karen apparently was an architect in her most recently changed
profession.</p>

<p><p>So they made all these lists of things that were imperfect with the
house, and I&rsquo;m not really clear on if/how/why the builder is obligated
to fix any of them, but the lists will be sent to me and to Diane on
Monday.  She&rsquo;ll be in touch with the builder to get stuff fixed.  I&rsquo;m
not sure what I can do to help.</p>

<p><p>Overall, I am enormously wiser and thankful for the process.  I&rsquo;ve
learned a lot about my house!!</p>

<p><p>Hole E Shit.  I just realized I didn&rsquo;t take a single picture.  I was so much not in <em>joy</em>, but in left brain serious mode that I didn&rsquo;t even think of taking one.  I had my camera in my pocket the entire time.</p>

<p><p>Anyway, I learned a lot about my house and it was a great process.</p>

<p><p>Blah!  I don&rsquo;t even know what else to say.  :-)</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ll call it lovely synchronicity, and not manic work work work to
make money for the new house.  Yesterday I worked 14.5 hours to
complete my portion of the SAS project, then handed it over at 9pm to
my boss to do the rest.  This version of the project goes into
production today as a pilot for a small group of people before we set
the masses of users loose on it.</p>

<p><p>Today is KTRU day!! I&rsquo;ll let you know how it goes.</p>

<p><p>Oh, speaking of KTRU, and I don&rsquo;t know if I mentioned this
previously, I got a parking ticket from the Rice University
Police.. for being a &ldquo;frequent visitor&rdquo; in the visitor parking lot.</p>

<p><p>I appealed the ticket the day after I got it, but haven&rsquo;t heard
back from them yet.  So today I&rsquo;ll park in the damn stadium parking
lot, which is fully 20 times further away than my lovely visitor lot
next to the Student Center where the station is located.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ll ask at the DJ meeting today if KTRU can support me in any way on this.</p>

<p><p>I think I may slide into the station a bit early so I can review CDs!</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ve been working diligently for the past 4.5 days on this SAS stuff,
and my SAS brain is getting pretty smart (I think).  Yesterday I wrote my
most complex SAS program ever - it merges datasets, creates datasets
dynamically, updates the datasets on disk according to user preferences..
 Good nerdy computer stuff.</p>

<p><p>There are a couple of things I still haven&rsquo;t been able to figure out -
some aspects of writing a new row to dataset, and keeping track of
iterations&hellip; simple in concept, but I just don&rsquo;t know the syntax.</p>

<p><p>My boss came back today after 4 days of being gone.  I just showed him
the results of my work.  What I wanted was, &ldquo;holy shit this is quite
impressive considering I just threw your ass into this SAS shit.&rdquo;  Instead
he pointed out some mispellings, talked about shifting things around on the
screen&hellip; entirely superficial crap that anyone could fix.  I&rsquo;ve been
focusing on the guts of this thing.</p>

<p><p>I asked him about the couple of thingies that I&rsquo;m not sure how to do.  I
showed him my code, and helped him get acquainted with it.  I wanted him to
just be able to show me the simple syntax of the counter, and give me an
example of writing to disk the way I need to.  Instead he pointed out
variable naming convention stuff (had a good reason in this case (var name
shows up in logs and it&rsquo;s good to know what project it&rsquo;s from)), and
poopooed my use of lots of macros (SAS version of procedures in Pascal).
 He is rewriting some/part/all of one of my programs.</p>

<p><p>I know my brain is smart.  I&rsquo;ve learned hella SAS these past 4 days.  I
am just thankful that I&rsquo;ll still get paid for my time.  I just wanted
ego-payment too.</p>

<p><p>Thanks for listening!</p>

<p><p>Yesterday I was basically at work all day; I got a good amount
accomplished, and I&rsquo;m getting a tad better at the SAS stuff.  Wende
brought lunch during the day, and then we zipped over to my crib for
Futurama and Simpsons.  We ate Boston Market dinner between the two.
Then watched Malcom in the Middle, but I&rsquo;m not proud of that.  ;-)</p>

<p><p>Today more work, plus I will open our investment club account with our broker.  Good thing too; the next meeting is this Saturday 25 March.</p>

<p><p>I just logged on to check my messages today after the weekend&hellip; 83 new messages.  Doh!!!  Most of them are spam in the form of ads or AOL Forwards, but still it&rsquo;s a lot to slog through.</p>

<p><p>Have a great and lovely day!!</p>

<p class=date>12:32am CST Sunday 19 March 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Going to bed now.  This evening has been greatly productive in
clearing out a lot of junkola from my apartment.  My sunroom, which
collected lots of tools and wires and car replacement parts (gaskets
and fuses, not tires and mufflers), tons of pictures, old letters, and
Day Planner pages from all the way back to 1992, is now clean(er).</p>

<p><p>Have also gone through 2 bookshelves, discarding about 5 percent of
the books.  Mostly stuff that I&rsquo;ve already read, or some 5 year old
college texts that I will almost probably never refer to again.  (of
the textbook variety, I did not discard <em>Graphics Programming on
the X-Windows System</em> or <em>Exploring our Universe</em>.)</p>

<p><p>Lots of tools will go back to my dad.  Plus I&rsquo;ll give him back the
Atari 2600 and several game cartridges.  He gave it to me for a bit
but said I mustn&rsquo;t throw/give it away; he wants it back.  (I learned
my packrat skills from my dad.)</p>

<p><p>Most interesting to me was finding old college pictures.  Lots of
pictures, including from my graduation!  Also quite interesting to me
were the Day Planner pages that I mentioned above.  Flipping through
them gave me the wild idea of creating 1992-1997 journal entries for
my website!  Who knows if I&rsquo;ll really do that, but it certainly seems
like a worthy project.</p>

<p><p>Oh, and that somehow reminds me of a thought I had today or so.
After watching on DVD the making of <em>The Matrix</em>, I felt a
longing to be &ldquo;famous&rdquo; or to somehow be known by tons of people.
After a few moments, I realized that longing is part of the reason I
maintain these journal entries.  In a weird way, I&rsquo;m famous to my
loyal readers.  I appreciate you!</p>
