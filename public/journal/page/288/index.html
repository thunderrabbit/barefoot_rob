<p>Sensitive seismometers and tiltmeters to be installed in the SAFOD borehole directly above the spot that ruptures will observe for the first time the birthing process of an earthquake from the zone where the earthquake energy accumulates. Preliminary observations made in 2006 already have revealed the tiniest earthquakes ever observed—so small they have negative magnitudes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>NOVA was late paying their staff last month and that the company issued a 750 million yen corporate bond at the beginning of August, which I assumed gave it the cash to pay instructors this month (which was the 15th or 20th - could someone confirm for me?). My own estimates put their foreign staff payroll in the range of 910-1040 million yen per month, so with some cash lying around, it seems they just managed to squeak by this month.</p>

<p>I find it interesting the article keeps the &ldquo;telephone company&rdquo; anonymous. If the phone company were to be outed, certainly the article would provide a bit of (bad) publicity.</p>

                        <p>##14:04 Sunday 15 July 2007</p>

<p>Looking back over the years, I&rsquo;m surprised by how much time and how much money I&rsquo;ve devoted to English, the world&rsquo;s most dominant language.  Sometimes I love English, but sometimes I really hate it, feeling that my longtime efforts haven&rsquo;t been paying off.  I still have difficulty dealing with the language.  To begin with, English is illogical and capricious.  I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be able to understand it completely even if I keep studying it for the rest of my life. It&rsquo;s just like a relationship with a guy, in which I&rsquo;m worried that my love may be unrequited.  I feel uneasy about the future and begin wondering if I should stick with him.</p>

<p>And I realize that he, Mr. English, is not the only guy.  I look around and notice there are so many attractive looking guys in the world.  For example, look at Mr.  Italian!  He looks gorgeous, cheerful and friendly.  I imagine I can have a great time with him.  So, I decide to break up with my boyfriend, tell him that we should have some time apart, and leave him for handsome Mr. Italian!</p>

<p>Mr Italian and I hit it off very well from the beginning.  For the first several weeks, I feel thrilled by every experience with my new boyfriend.  He gives me new perspectives and pleasant surprises, which have been missing in the relationship with my ex.  Even our differences amuse me. (I even find our differences amusing.)  More than anything, I&rsquo;m happy to see my improvement every day.  Could he be my soulmate?</p>

<p>However, after the honeymoon, things start to change.  He begins to show me his dark sides.  He looks happy-go-lucky, but deep inside, he&rsquo;s complicated and difficult to get along with.  I am disappointed to find that his amiable manner is just superficial.  For instance, when I tell him that I&rsquo;ll see a friend of mine, he always asks if the friend is male or female&hellip; always!  My ex-boyfriend was not so nervous.  He had only surprised me by asking whether I wanted to see one friend or a few friends.</p>

<p>I now realize how simple my life was with my old flame.  Suddenly, a lot of memories come back to me - how I first met him, our first fight and making up&hellip; Hey, I miss my ex!  OK, I know he has a lot of negative aspects, but I think I can handle them because I&rsquo;ve become used to them in our long relationship.</p>

<p>After all, he&rsquo;s my Mr. Right.</p>

<p>So, I dump Mr. Italian and go back to Mr. English.  Acknowledging I was wrong, I tell him I&rsquo;ve realized how much I loved him after leaving him.  And I ask him if he&rsquo;ll give me another chance.</p>

<p>Mr. English opens his arms to me and we get back together again.  I&rsquo;m trying to make things work and feel comfortable being with him, at least for now.  Still, the world is full of temptations.  I may have another fling or a one-night stand if I get tired of our relationship again.  Because, some guys are just irresistible, you know?  Hey, that&rsquo;s Mr. Arabic.  Doesn&rsquo;t he look exotic?</p>

<p>Okay so it all started ten years ago.  I made Marble Track 2 during my
free time at work and then made this video.</p>


<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mlUqu6QE7bw" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>


<p>People asked how I made the marble track.  It&rsquo;s a simple question
without a simple answer.  &ldquo;I glued sticks together..&rdquo;</p>

<p>I decided I should answer by showing the pipe cleaner characters
making the track.  So this set of videos (which will eventually be one
video) will answer the question about how to make the track.</p>
