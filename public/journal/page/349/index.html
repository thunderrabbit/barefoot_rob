<p>I'm still awake.  Actually I took a nap for a couple hours, but I
wonder how I'll feel when I need to be awake in some hours.  I've been
working on my site, and have restructured how the navigation files are
called; I found out how to send parameters to indicate which page is
calling the cgi file.  So now instead of having a bunch of separate
.pl files I have one file that reads the params.. much simpler.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>

<p>ps: it's light outside.  as in, daylight.</p>

<p>Haha</p>

<p>Olivia just got caught buying a Child (elementary age) train
ticket.  The cat was all, "sumasen!" trying to get her attention and I
thought it was some panhandler, which is amazing cause Tokyo just
doesn't have such.   But he was dressed rather well and then the
(noun): "Child ticket."</p>

<p>"Oh, student ticket," explained Olivia, who didn't feign surprise,
but acted as if he had simply mistaken her for someone who should pay
full fare.</p>

<p>No shame.  No guilt.</p>

<p>Lessons are going okay today.  No disasters.  Some good animal
flash card house building with Tomohiro after Jon's lesson with him
after which Jon wrote "he was a sugoy $#!+ today."</p>

<p>This is the same kid who had his head on the desk for fully 30
minutes after I came into the room, during which time I ignored him
and arranged and rearranged the animal cards in several possible
manners, including the magician trick of flipping over a row of cards
on the floor like a wave.   After 30 minutes he began to acknowledge
me and I offered him cards, but asked no questions and and and then by
the end he was doing flips underneath the table and had recited all
the animal card names, etc.</p>

<p>Today with Jon, Tomohiro was yelling "Ego janai!" (no English!) at
Jon and throwing shit around.</p>

<p>Today with me, we just made animal card houses and recited the
names.  I introduced the colors, but he didn't respond to that.  Ah
well; we had fun.</p>

<p>With all the kangaroos in Japan, of course I'd have a dream about
one.</p>

<p class=dream>A young girl was waalking down a bridge, like a freeway
overpass and listening to a walkie talkie type thing to tell her where
certain people were located.  "There's a young woman walking right;
thereis a young man coming toward you," but it turns out these spoken
words were warning her where not to go, or where to go she came
running back up the bridge and then down beside it and jumped onto a
hospital stretcher next to a kangaroo.  The kangaroo was wwell
natured, and well trained enough to lie flat on his back.  I was
talking to the kangaroo and soon enough he turned and kinda was laying
on his side so I could talk to him moreasily but his huge feet were
kinda in my face and a bit uncomfortable to lie on, but we were joking
around and laughing, but his leg was kinda poking into my stomach, and
it was a combination of funny and painful and he could talk, but
didn't realize or didn't bother to concern himself with how he was
arranged.  So I was chillin' with a kangaroo when I woke up this
morning.</p>

<p>Headed to work now.  Pre internet in my apartment days, I tried to
leave around 8am so I could get to work before anyone else and study
until the Japanese staff came and I could flex my latest Japanese
vocab for them.</p>

<p>Work today wasn't the worst Saturday ever.   I almost had the best
class ever when none of FOUR students showed up for 10 minutes.  I
thought I was in no-show-heaven until one arrived.  So I was like cool
no problem; I like man to mans, but then another came, so I was like
sigh but I can just have them talk to each other, and then another
came so I had three students, which is generally the least favorable
number.</p>

<p>Oh god in one kid's class I was just fucking falling asleep so
hardcore; it was practically tragic.  Wow.</p>

<p>I'm reminded of this cause I'm falling asleep now on the train.  I
can't keep my train of thought.  Cecile didn't see me when she got on
the train.  She trained at Kawasaki with her main man Matthew.</p>

<p>Going home now but my train is crazy late.  We're just fuckin
chillin in Kawasaki station.  We've been here long enough for me to
type all this on my ketai. Still here.  No one is complaining but it
just got significantly more packed on the train as a new wave of
people just got on. Man, this bites. More crowded now. Oh good there's
the sigh of relief as the doors close and we are at the first station
now. Actually now we are at the 2nd station.  Okay bye.</p>

<p class=date>10:53pm</p>

<p>The train got even more packed at Hirama as more people squeezed
on.  It was about the most packinist train I've experienced in
Tokyo.</p>

<p>Cors saw me as we arrived at Musashi-Kosugi where pushers wearing
their crisp short sleeve shirts and captains hats with trim were
poised to push people onto the trains.</p>

<p>Turns out the train was late due to what translates to Human Body
Incident.  Someone committed suicide by leaping in front of the
train.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>It's amazing to me that people kill themselves with this particular
technique in Japan.  Reason: the <em>family</em> of the deceased is
fined for the incident.</p>

<p class=date>11:32pm</p>

<p>Doing some research to see if I can verify my claim that the family
is charged and I found this movie review:  eeek!</p>
