<p>Today at CB we met at 3pm because their Monday meeting was pushed back
to today at noon, when I normally meet Satomi.  But so I met her at
3pm and we got ticket 2748 updated with her new image.  It&rsquo;s up on
demo2 now, and I hope they&rsquo;ll approve it soon.</p>

<p>I also explained why the FS server had ground to a halt last week:
lack of storage space due to lack of rotating a log file which had
grown to be 11 GB.  oops!</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t been able to log in to my local machine using ngrok.com
because of something I haven&rsquo;t probably figured out yet.  Earlier
today, I realized the problem must be that I&rsquo;m trying to setcookie on
the wrong domain, or rather, on the domain my local box sees, and not
on ngrok.com.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t test it directly because I&rsquo;m currently offline, but I tried to
break the cookie here locally, but I can still log in.  Dammit.</p>

<p>I should enjoy this moment when I&rsquo;m upset that I can log in to
something.</p>

<p>I left the toy store early today so I could confirm I had found the
source of the problem, but I cannot confirm it.  So now I&rsquo;m stuck in
the conveni which features hundreds of items I might consume if
hungry, and even some things I&rsquo;m trying to resist buying now.</p>

<p>I just want to sleep.  Or actually I want to have web access.</p>

<p>LM spent 1,500,000 yen on pachinko last year or so, devestating her
meager retirement savings.  I, C, and L have banded together to
support her, creating a new bank account and putting 30,000 yen into
the account per month while LM puts another 30,000 yen into the new
account (to which she has no access).</p>

<p>LM won&rsquo;t tell L how much LM needs per month to live.  I believe this
is because LM still has a problem with gambling and wants to hide
money to feed the addiction.  This simple point caused a bit of a
snippity conversation between LM and L.</p>

<p>LM doesn&rsquo;t want to live alone, and I believe she can still live with
her kid and kid&rsquo;s husband no worries, even if they move to a new
house.</p>

<p>Anyway, because of the touchy subject, when Lin forgot her cellie in
the rental car, I offered to go back with her and get it.  She was
like, &ldquo;but I thought you have your men&rsquo;s group,&rdquo; and she wanted me to
say &ldquo;I do, but I have to time; I have to go to the station anyway,&rdquo;
but instead I was surly, and was like, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you let me take care
of my schedule?  I know what time I have to go; I was just offering to
go with you because I thought it would be nice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The house still looks nice to me on second look, fine to Lin&rsquo;s mom on
first look, and fine to Lin on her third look.  My computer desk will
not fit as is in the loft, but there&rsquo;s a built-in seat next to the
loft landing, and I could make or buy a desk that can hold my computer
and monitor (or two?)</p>

<p>We are about to walk to Yurigaoka to see if Lin&rsquo;s mom is comfortable
walking the route in the morning on her way to work.</p>

<h2 id="15-15">15:15</h2>

<p>Headed back home after taking the bus from 新百合ケ丘 to the house (15
minutes).  Lin&rsquo;s making me a bit crazy by what I imagine is making her
mom a bit crazy, speaking quickly about the different options for
transit.</p>

<h2 id="wednesday-13-jan-2016">Wednesday 13 Jan 2016</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;ve basically decided not to get it because the process requires
$20,000 cash up front, which we don&rsquo;t really have (and cannot borrow
from bank as part of the loan).</p>

<p>A few days ago I signed up for <a href="https://ghostinspector.com/">Ghost Inspector</a> and thought hmmm I&rsquo;d love to have 1000
tests per month instead of just 100.</p>

<p>Boom they have that option!</p>

<pre><code>We're glad you're enjoying the product! Unfortunately, we don't
offer any paid plans that are less than 10,000 test
runs/month. However, we do have a promotion with Runscope (our
parent company) where your free account will be bumped up from the
100 test runs per month on the default free plan to 1,000 test
runs per month if you sign up for both services.
</code></pre>

<p>I signed up for <a href="https://www.runscope.com/">runscope</a> and set up an API test to boot!</p>

<p>Title says it all, but actually I was the only one who ate at 31.  I
had Vani Vani Vanilla, but it wasn&rsquo;t as good as Popping Shower.</p>

<p>Taiyaki Hiiragi are the azuki bean filled pastries, &hellip; and they were
<em>full</em>.</p>

<p>The ramen shop tasted like ramen to me, but it had come twice
recommended to Joanna.</p>

<p>Ouca ice cream was served with salty seaweed, which I thought was
gross.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re still chillin&rsquo; in Baskin Robbins now, with Snoop Dogg Ain&rsquo;t
Nothing but a G-Thang, and now MC Hammer 2 Legit to Quit playing on
overhead speakers.</p>

<p>After an oopsy trip to Chiba, we went to the station after Yokosuka.
Got some Chinese food at a small shop with Chinese proprietors with
whom Joanna spoke a bit in Mandarin.</p>

<p>Went to see Eric&rsquo;s old house in the area, and in the same neighborhood
met an Australian guy named Geoffrey who had just moved into his house
9 months ago and has been reforming it since then.  Wow!  It looked
really nice, and he said it&rsquo;s the third house he&rsquo;s reformed in this
type of way, so Lin and I got his infos to see if we can have him work
on our new house, whenever we end up getting it.</p>

<p>Had a family outing with Joanna and Eric from San Francisco, who are
in town for a week.  I hadn&rsquo;t met Eric, but I had met Joanna briefly 4
years ago when Lin and I stayed at her family home (out of which she
had already moved) when we got married in the US.</p>

<p>I got to sit next to Eric at Its Vegetable (or is it It&rsquo;s Vegetable)
near Kinshicho(?) last night.  He&rsquo;s great at asking questions!  I need
to learn how to do that more naturally.  Best I could really do was
&ldquo;how about you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He works at Google (jelly) and asked what cloud provider I use.  I
told him basically AWS, so we talked about that for a bit.</p>

<p>On my right were Takumi, Yuu at the head of the table, and Mikarin
across the table from me.  I showed them the two puzzles from Mayumi
which I had solved.  I was able to solve the butterfly one, but
interestingly couldn&rsquo;t get the horseshoe one solved, though I claimed
it was the easier of the two.</p>

<p>Lin and I are on 南武線 now to look at some houses near Yomiuriland!</p>

<h2 id="15-37">15:37</h2>

<p>Of the three houses we saw, we both agree on their order of
awesomeness.  The most awesome one has a loft, is built with old
school wooden building techniques, and features beams above the living
room upon which the cats and I can walk.  I&rsquo;m not 100% sure they are
s00p3r str0ng enough to hold me easily, but I kinda bet they are.  For
the cats, they&rsquo;re quite fine.</p>

<p>Right now as I write this, we&rsquo;re on a bus heading to 百合ヶ丘 station,
the kanji for which is quite easy to write, so that&rsquo;s nice too.  Lin
is talking to a 75 year old woman who we met on the way to the bus
stop.  She seems quite genki for her age, possibly in part due to the
hills in the area.</p>

<p>Wow we&rsquo;re already at the station; that was quick!</p>

<p>But perhaps most importantly, we&rsquo;re within <em>walking</em> distance of
Yomiuri Land!!</p>

<p>Here are pics of the house we like best:</p>

<p>I just bought an account on <a href="https://ngrok.com">https://ngrok.com</a> so I can use ghost inspector to
test my local machines running on virtualbox.  Sweet!</p>

<p>I sent a couple emails back and forth with Alan who quickly solved the
setup issue I was having.  He showed me how I can easily use ngrok to
test my site which only exists on my local virtualbox machine via a
domain which only exists in my <code>/etc/hosts</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>./ngrok http -host-header=mylocal.exampledomain.net  mylocal.exampledomain.net:80
</code></pre>

<p>And now that I&rsquo;ve signed up, I have reserved rob.ngrok.io as one of my
three reserved names for connection tunnels!</p>

<pre><code>./ngrok http -host-header=mylocal.exampledomain.net -subdomain rob  mylocal.exampledomain.net:80
</code></pre>

<p>Shwiing!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m consdering buying an account with <a href="ghostinspector.com">ghostinspector</a>, but the lowest
price is a bit high for me .. $100 per month for 10,000 tests per
month.  If it were $100 per year for 1000 tests per month, then I&rsquo;d
have it already.</p>
