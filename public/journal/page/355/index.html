<p>Mr Tired, eh?</p>

<p>I'm glad I came home.  I'm full of food and cookies and orange
juice (mostly the latter two), and have just watched <em>The
MATRIX</em> on the DVD Koko loaned to me.  Rock awesome.  Just as good
as the first ten times I've seen it.</p>

<p>Didn't watch the chapter where Cipher kills the good guys; I don't
like watching Switch die.  Not like that.  (haha get it?)</p>

<p>I still think my ending of the movie is better, though.</p>

<p>I'm going to sleep for some hours and then I'll play online for
probably a while.</p>

<p class=date>9:44pm</p>

<p>Hahaha I'm one easy day away from my weekend.</p>

<p>Goodnight.</p>

<p>Work was okay at first and then turned yucky after teaching a kid
who climbed all over me and yelled and was generally crazy.  I might
have emerged without a headache if I hadn't concerned myself with
keeping him from writing on me with a whiteboard marker, or fucking up
my tie or whatever.</p>

<p>Might also have been better had I not emerged on the bell that
<em>started</em> the <b><em>next</em></b> class, as opposed to ended
the class period we were in.  So I had less than no time left to get
to my next class, much less plan a lesson.</p>

<p>Scott's ears perked up after the next class when Guy was all, "do
you have your last classes files?" and I'm like, "no; I never found
them."</p>

<p>Scott asked me later if everything was okay (doing his good AT-ly
duty) and I told him no and didn't go into details about how hungry I
felt (feel) and homesick I am.  Just told him about being late after
the kids class.</p>

<p>The next class </p>

<p>Man, I'm like dizzy almost, and it's not like I didn't eat today
cause I did.  And not just junk.  Lemme think; I had rice + eggs +
sausage + Pocari Sweat drink this morning and rice + some yellow
textured protein + some brown textured protein + some more Pocari
Sweat for lunch.  And some custard pastry things.</p>

<p>The next class lesson I chose was one I had successfully presented
some times before, so it was okay.  Then my level 4 was poopy cause
the mofos wouldn't talk, and then thankfully blah blah blah</p>

<p>After work I took a million years to finish writing some BS in the
files I had left over.  I did a superficial search for some I couldn't
find, but didn't worry when I couldn't find them.</p>

<p>Outside, I saw a student who seemed to have worse English outside
than in school, but he got across to me an invitation to drink with
him and some of the students, etc.  I was all, "no," though I was
torn, but as I sit here, I'm so glad I said no.  I'm WAY tired, and it
would have been a bad scene for me had I tried to be perky funny happy
Rob with them.</p>

<p>Today after work I watched Animatrix and most of the extra stuff on
the DVD.  Interesting, but not amazing.  I'm not particularly
enthralled with animation, though I have an intrigued respect for
those who produce it.  I just think, "damn, that sure is a lot of
images to draw."</p>

<p>When listening to the commentary, I could see intellectually why
they used certain techniques, but watching the actual clips didn't
consciously fill me with the emotions they seemed to</p>

<p>bollucks. (how do you spell that?)</p>

<p>They were like blah blah blah we tried to convey this emotion and
that other with the blah blah and I'm like, meh.</p>

<p>The only thing that I did get while watching the film was that a
set of the scenes of the robot vs human war included many scenes from
actual human tragedies people have inflicted upon one another.</p>

<p>I've been awake since 4:45 or so thinking about work yesterday.
Two things seem particularly noteworthy.</p>

<p>(one) kid, named Shigeshi (I think) is about 10 years old.  He
lived in the US for four years, and definitely can do any of the Kids'
Modules we have at Nova.</p>

<p>His mother has therefore asked us to have him work from a more
difficult book.  Cory told me yesterday that we needed to push him to
do the work from that book; otherwise his mom will be upset, etc.</p>

<p>So I'm kickin' it with this kid, fuckin' around with him as a
warm-up, asking where he's from, and telling him he's from all the
wrong places, "you're not from Japan, you're from Canada."  "No you
are from Canada!"  and have him identify Canada on a world map, and
Mexico and some geography that most American kids his age couldn't do
and he's all warmed up and happy and I'm like aight, crack out yer
book....</p>

<p>Nova is not an English Conversation School.  It's a business.  And,
from what I can tell, most businesses in Japan will do *ANYTHING* to
acquire and retain customers.  (*That* is (at least part of the
reason) why a store clerk will <em>run</em> to the counter to ring up
my purchase. (maybe s/he was restocking shelves as I shopped, begging
my pardon if s/he got in my way of anything, then when I headed toward
the counter, *bang* s/he was there for me.))</p>

<p>Nova, at the detriment of its ability to help students most
effectively, will level up students who say they won't buy any more
lessons unless they are leveled up.  We've got some students who are
officially in level 4, but who have a level 6 ability.</p>

<p>(( not that one's ability in a language can *possibly* be described
with a single variable (level), but there is often a correlation
between different aspects of language speaking ability across several
different variables (speed, precision "I pretty cat", vocabulary "I
gorgeous feline", structure "pretty am I cat") so it kinda makes sense
to clump these variables into one. ))</p>

<p>Nova, at the request of a parent, will use a different text for a
man to man kids lesson.  Done correctly, this could be a Very Good
Thing for the kid.  Might even be Fantastic.   Done with a book that
is *far* too difficult for even a native speaker of that age, it's a
Very Unhelpful Thing.</p>

<p>.... Shigeshi's energy plummeted.  He tried to avoid the pain by
pulling out the wrong book first.  (I didn't know I was being tricked;
I didn't know what book the mother had specified.  When he couldn't
tell me which lesson he was supposed to do in this imposter book, I
said, "what lesson does your mom want you to do?" and the real book
came out.)  Had Cory not said anything like "push him to do it," I
woulda been all, wtf?  this book is way too difficult.</p>

<p>I'm realizing this now, imagining that *I* could explain to the mom
that the book is way too hard.  The vocabulary was in the high school
reading level for native speakers! and this cat is non-native,
non-high school...  And he's being forced (at his great detriment
(energy plummet proves it to me)) to choke on this horse pill of
vocabulary and grammatical gymnastics just because the mom is paying
us to choke him!</p>

<p>Argh.  And that's the first thing that was keeping me up.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>(four) level 6 adult students (I hate teaching 4 at a time
(actually it's not that I hate it, but.. yeah it is.) cause I can't
(yet?) cater a lesson to four different personalities, four different
abilities (multiple dimensions included), and then realistically
evaluate the students' performance in different areas.. the shit is
ridiculous.) were talking about travel with me, and using language
like</p>

<pre>
"Where did you go last week?"

"I went to Switzerland."

"What did you do there?"

"I went there go shopping."
</pre>

<p>And I'm like "Stop the Presses!" and changed it to "I shopped" but
couldn't give them a simple reason why, nor a technique to produce the
correct answer in the future.</p>

<p>This morning I figured out what I could have said to them.</p>

<p>"Start with "I." Look at the word after "you."  Transform that and
put the result after "I."  Now memorize what the W-question words are
asking and put the answer after whatever you put after the transformed
result."</p>

<p>Okay, were I talking to a really smart computer, that might make
sense, but I know what I mean, and I could have given them examples
and it woulda been great.  It is great.</p>

<p>Enough about work.  I'm tired again.  To sleep or not to sleep.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class=date>6:08am</p>

<p>Wait there's more.  I have a great deal of respect for Cory, and he
agreed that the book is too hard for Shigeshi.  So why does Cory seem
powerless to do the right thing (which I judge to be get the mom to
get the kid a more appropriate book)?  He said the staff has talked to
the mom, etc....  There must be some way to get it across.  Unless
she's just wiggidy wack crazed in the head, which means there is a
whole set of different issues to remedy.</p>

<p>Woke up a tad later than usual on Friday.  Zing through a shower
(no shave, washing only the essentials), zing to the train station,
perfectly made the 8:45am local train to Shibuya.  For some reason, we
were not passed by an express nor a limited express train during our
transit.</p>

<p>I wonder what is the simplest way to express the train schedule.
There's several components to it - basically when the trains will
arrive at a particular station, and how fast they'll travel.  Though
those are inexorably (sp) linked.  But there's also a component of
trains passing other trains at particular stations.  Some stations
have only one track through them, so the express trains cannot
possibly pass the others.</p>

<p>Yadda yadda yadda; I don't yet have it all figured out.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Got to Starbucks in Shibuya just in time to meet Ayana.  Bought an
expensive sandwich (not because it was big, but because I was at
Starbucks).</p>

<p>Ayana was quite impressed with the sentences I had written last
night.  That positive feedback / good feeling is definitely enough to
make me do *that* again.   Plus it's good practice.</p>

<p>She gave me adjectives today - those that end with i and others
that end with na.</p>

<p>Told me how to use to (and / with), and maybe something else.</p>

<p class=date>6:50pm</p>

<p>Work is not over, but I have the quote of the day, a question:</p>

<pre>
"Have you eaten in Japan?"
</pre>

<p>And this was uttered by a level 6 student who I've been teaching
each week for the past month at KQ.</p>

<p>Rain is a fine misty sprinkle barely perceptible.  Tiny little dots
appear on my glasses.  I woogie my hand through my buzzed hair and no
water runs down my face or neck.  Not enough water to form a single
drop.</p>

<p>Woke up without an alarm this morning (an alarm is rare for me
here; I've used mine maybe 10 times, and I think all those times were
before early May), though I was a bit groggy after being awake so late
online and yammering with janette.</p>

<p>Shower seems to be collecting mildew again.  I may scrub it down
again.  The rainy season is apparently good for mildew growth.</p>

<p class=date>11:52am</p>

<p>Helped Aki learn how to give directions today.  "Go this way
(point) two blocks.  Turn right and go to the second light.  You'll
see the park on your left."</p>

<p>I wrote for her instructions on how to get to Kawasaki Nova (how to
get to the station, take the train, take the next train, etc etc)</p>

<p>Gave her homework: how to get to Kawasaki Nova without using the
trains.  She prefers taking the bus.</p>

<p>I ask if anyone has questions for me at the beginning of most of my
Nova lessons.  Sometimes they ask "how long are you in Japan?" or "How
long Japan?" or "How long do you in Japan?"  From now on I might tell
them the number of days I've been here.  (After correcting their
English) It's a tiny way of shattering the crystal Nova way of doing
things.  It's not even against any of the rules, so it's my perfect
little thing; I can tell people how many days I've been here.</p>

<p>So I worked it out.</p>

<p>I've been in Japan 77 days.  This is my 77th day in Japan.  Any
students who ask me how long I've been in Japan (I'll probably be
asked 4 times today) will find out that I've been here 77 days.</p>

<p>Being me, I decide I want a days-in-Japan counter on my site.  I
think I'll put it on my journal page only.  Top right corner maybe.
Next to the navigation icons.  Might have to rewrite some perl.</p>

<p>Okay, I want to design it right *now*.  Fuck Nova; I want to work
on my site.  Energy building, nowhere to go...  I want to pull a Neo
and just BLAM!  Blast out of here.</p>

<p>Just now I had a man to man lesson with a female who triggered me a
little bit.  Smile and nice teeth and all that.  When she seemed so
thankful for my suggestion that she look on google for hostels, I was
sooo tempted to give her my email, "in case you have any problems."</p>

<p>I didn't give it to her.</p>

<p>At the very end, I was like "do you have any more classes?" as I
always ask, and she goes "no; do you have any more classes?" and I had
a break next (now), but got stuck on whether to answer I have two more
classes, but go until 9 o'clock, or to.. and I just flipped a bit and
wrote "I work until 9 o'clock" on a new piece of paper and gave it to
her with the fantasy that she would show up discreetly waiting for me
so we can talk and flirt.</p>

<p>And now I'm like "shit" what am I doing? and want her *not* to be
here and *not* to show up, etc.  She almost certainly won't come back,
and if she does I can be like "whatever, dude," but that's kinda
shitty - or really the shit thing was telling her that in the first
place, but the real thing seems to be learning why am I alone in
Japan?</p>

<p>Home from work.  Kinda sorta easy day today if I ignore being
unable to write helpful comments.  I never read the comments, or when
I do read them I can hardly make them do anything useful for me, so
maybe (!) no one can write useful comments @(@ some people write
useful ones but I don't know what to do with them.  (#) comments
suck.  4() I'd rather not talk about it. (%) all of the above )^( none
of the above.  7: some of the above.  *: maybe.</p>

<p>The quote of the day happened during Voice:</p>

<pre>
I like Chinese food, but I don't like real Chinese food.
</pre>

<p>Three people called in sick today:  Olivia, Jen, Adriana.  All
women.  All part-timers.  All from OZ.</p>

<p>Tonight at midnight we get paid.</p>

<p>Several people indicated they are low on funds.  I just said,
"yeah" and "mmm" and stuff.</p>

<p>I intend to write many sentences in Japanese tonight.</p>

<p class=date>10:27pm</p>

<p>Go!</p>

<p class=date>11:56pm</p>

<p>I wrote twice as many sentences as last time.  Kinda too tired to
write them here.  Um,.. dammit.  Okay I'll do it.</p>

<p>This morning I quit flopping around in bed pretty early.  Rode to
Lawson, got breakfast, came home, ate, then studied Japanese.  I
choose to get back into the habit of studying frequently.</p>

<p>I wrote several sentences.</p>

<p>Called janette and yammered with her for 50 minutes.  I wrote
sentences for only 30 minutes; how can I have chatted with her for so
much longer?</p>

<p>Here are the sentences I wrote:</p>

<pre>
わたしはのりまきがすきです。
I like norimaki.

わたしはとんぷらがすきです。
I like tempura.

わたしはホトココがすきです。
I like hot cocoa.

ぼくはなっとをたべませんでした。

けさにほんごをべんきょました。
This morning I studied Japanese.

きょうよじにかわさきのｃｉｎｅｃｉｔｔａでマtリゥをみます。
Today in Kawasaki at Cinecitta, I'm going to watch Matrix.

きのうのばんしぶやでぼくのがくせいにおしえました。
Yesterday in Shibuya I taught my student.

ぼくははこねがすきです。

ぼくはたばこがきらいです。
I don't like tobacco.

ここはぼくのまえです。

あしはつくえのうえです。
