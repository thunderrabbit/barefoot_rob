<p>In the first adult lesson at JB, we flexed some reported speech
muscles with Side By Side book 1, where the target language is &ldquo;This
is a photograph of my son Bart.  He is riding a skateboard outside our
house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We changed it to be &ldquo;This is a photograph of me riding a skateboard in
from of my house&rdquo; and then &ldquo;That is a photograph of him riding a
skateboard in from of his house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the second adult lesson, Hide and I told Yutaro to look up WTC7.
Yutaro was 8 years old on Airplane Day (, the name Fred and I use for
the day).</p>

<p>In the last lesson, students came in one by one.  We talked about
movies for a bit and then read a brief story about a couple who gave
away a lot of their lottery winnings and thereby did not let the money
change them.  Kaori listened to it twice without reading.  Kyoko and
Misato both listened once and then read along the second time.</p>

<p>New vocab:</p>

<ul>
<li>ruin</li>
<li>indeed</li>
<li>owe</li>
</ul>

<p>I finally made a dental appointment (with the dentist right under JB&rsquo;s
office) after over a year of not going.  It&rsquo;s for April 10th; there
was no availability that lined up with mine.  I will probably go to a
dentist near our house sometime in Feb or March.</p>

<p>Sweets Party Attendants had their second to last lesson with me
today.  The mood was both somber and joyful; it has been great working
with them over the years.</p>

<li>Lin and I still have our cat Jennie, still keep her in at night,
still live in Asao-ku near the bottom of a hill.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m still working on Marble Track 3, trying to do at least 2 hours
of livestream per week.</li>
<li>I have been working on AB, getting tests added to cover the
important parts of the codebase.  I do not have a lot covered, but
10 tests is an order of magnitude more than 0.</li>
<li>Plus I figured out a way to test AJAX even though I cannot use
Javascript in my tests yet.  (run the AJAX call directly)</li>
<li>I have all my flights purchased for my trip to Vancouver, Houston,
Austin, Hawaii, all focused on MKP, but trying to see some of my
peeps.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, I messed up regarding seeing Colleenie Beanie
<em>again</em> this year.  I said I will sort it out for sure next year
and she said &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;   Fair enough.</li>
<li>I gotta let my Houston and Austin peeps know.</li>
<li>Have written two video briefs to make two MKP videos. One focused
on inviting men to our circle, and one focused on inviting support
for our circle and expanding into Japanese language.</li>
<li>I have recently been in touch with Brian (also in IT), Tony (truck
driver), and Frederick (change agent) via Zoom.  I asked for
support from them when I was beginning to get overwhelmed with all
the tasks across my variety of projects.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.marbletrack3.com/">Marble Track 3</a> has had its site
updated via Deligence.  I think we had some minor communication
problems, but the site looks super great compared to what it was.
Maybe I should hire some other peeps to work on it more.</li>
<li>Lesson starting now at Solid Square.</li>

<p>Just a couple days ago I got my tickets all sorted to staff two
different NWTA weekends and also attend the MKP USA Face to Face
weekend in Texas.</p>

<p>After pretty much settling on the plans, it was pointed out that
attending an IGFT might give me more of the training I am looking for,
but I trust this is the training / trip I need.</p>

<p>The goal of all this is to deepen the (emotional) work we can do in
Tokyo Men&rsquo;s Circle, by improving my facilitation skills.  That will
thereby hopefully inspire more men to take facilitation roles in the
group.</p>

<p>In addition, we are beginning to translate one of the workshops into
Japanese so we can invite Japanese men into the work as well.  For
that part, I am asking Takeshi to lead and facilitate; maybe we should
do a trial run and then a small version, then a real version.</p>

<p>Lots of changes since just three weeks ago.</p>

<ol>
<li>I created a Gofundme with a target of $46,000 to <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/launching-mankind-project-operations-in-japan">kick off Mankind
Project Japan</a>.  $525 so far!</li>
<li>I created a 2.5 minute demo as a TEDx audition vid.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4el81YK3s3Q">Safely expressing emotions makes life better</a>.</li>
<li>Pinky has placed most of the decorative blocks along the
<a href="https://www.marbletrack3.com/parts/decorative_walls_after_the_lowest_small-medium_splitter/">Decorative Walls after the Lowest Small-Medium Splitter</a>,
although I have not taken a new picture that shows all of them so
far.</li>
<li>I have been checking in with Dora each week recently after signing
up for her <a href="https://www.thriveinjapan.com/">Thrive in Japan</a>
course.  She brought the big shifts to my attention so I am writing
about them now!</li>
<li>Shirley has offered 50,000 air miles toward my trip to the US.
Trying to go to Vancouver (and hopefully see Colleenie Beanie Dog!)
then Houston/Austin, then Hawaiiiiii</li>
<li>Delta-Mom has offered a buddy pass ticket price, so that should
help as well!  Gifts from the heavens!</li>
<li>I will be taking a five week course starting this week which should
give me some insights on making Tokyo Men&rsquo;s Circle even better.</li>
<li>I have been trying to clean up my new.robnugen.com deploy process
so it can run on Netlify.com</li>
<li>Kevin&rsquo;s website was down after a wordpress automatic upgrade failed
to copy over the themes and plugins from the old installation.  I
guess they were in a non-standard location.  I got it fixed though,
and it was nice to talk to him.</li>
<li>I hired a designer to make a nicer version of
<a href="https://www.marbletrack3.com/">Marble Track 3 website</a>.  As of
this writing, the live site looks like
this
<a href="https://5c42ec0d7c4b6f0008a1f95c--wonderful-bhabha-dfd1ef.netlify.com/">https://5c42ec0d7c4b6f0008a1f95c--wonderful-bhabha-dfd1ef.netlify.com/</a>,
and the new site looks something like this

<p>I had a weird issue with crontab today.</p>

<p>If I editted the crontab while logged in as root, it did not work.</p>

<pre><code>$# whoami
root
$# crontab -e
   ((( make edits )))
crontab: installing new crontab
</code></pre>

<p>But the changes did not work.</p>

<pre><code>$# exit
$ whoami
ubuntu
sudo crontab -e
   ((( make edits )))
crontab: installing new crontab
</code></pre>

<p>And the changes work just fine.</p>

<p>One clear difference was user ubuntu was using nano to edit, while
user root was using emacs&hellip;  But seems weird if that would make a
difference.</p>

<p>The same cronfile was edited both times.</p>

<p>Anyway, I got it working by <code>sudo crontab -e</code> instead of having root
do <code>crontab -e</code>.</p>

<p>TL;DR:
<a href="https://www.gofundme.com/launching-mankind-project-operations-in-japan">https://www.gofundme.com/launching-mankind-project-operations-in-japan</a></p>

<p>Just to confirm it is really me, I am posting a first person version
of the ManKind Project Japan GoFundme campaign
&ldquo;<a href="https://www.gofundme.com/launching-mankind-project-operations-in-japan">Launching ManKind Project Operations in Japan</a>&ldquo;
text here on my journal:</p>

<p><a href="https://mankindproject.org/">ManKind Project</a> challenges each man to
find and develop his own life’s mission, and to live that mission
fully with the support of a powerful network. ManKind Project has
become a global phenomenon.</p>

<p>A group of <a href="https://nwta.mkp.org">NWTA</a>-initiated men feel a deep
conviction that Japan will benefit greatly from the work. We are
building and bringing the MKP organization and way of life to Japan, a
nation that in 2014 saw on average 70 suicides a day with the vast
majority of them being men. We believe that with your help and our
dedicated men on the ground, we can access the necessary resources for
this exciting undertaking.</p>

<p>After growing Tokyo I-group for 3 years, I am leading this mission to
establish MKP Japan and now want to dedicate myself to this goal. To
support the organization in 2019, we are reaching out and asking for
help from other men and women who understand the value this work can
bring. We need people and services, such as translation and
interpreting, facilities for men’s circles, trainings, and lectures,
advertising, and we need more facilitation skills to deepen the
emotional work in men’s circles.</p>

<p>To improve my facilitation skills, I am planning on flying to the US
for the annual MKP Face to Face weekend in March, and to staff two
NWTA weekends. This we believe will bring our vision to the next
level. If anyone can help me out with this trip and help us with
getting this work to men in Japan for 2019 we would be grateful. If
you can donate air miles, contact me at rob(at)mkpjapan.org (a new
shiny address!!).  Your help will truly make a difference in expanding
MKP Japan.</p>

<p>Any donation will go towards supporting our activities for the 2019
budget of JPY 4,982,308, or approximately USD 46,000. This is
absolutely barebones for launching in a city as expensive as Tokyo. We
are going to make this happen and hope men from all over the world can
soon staff at NWTAs in Japan or simply sit in the circle with
us. Please join us in changing the world, one nation at a time.</p>

<p>It has taken me a long time to reach this point, but from
<a href="/journal/1997/11/15/new-warrior-training">being afraid of men</a> in
1997, I am now facilitating deep emotional work in men&rsquo;s circles every
week, both online and face to face in Tokyo.</p>

<p>I want to deepen my skills as a facilitator and have decided to step
more fully into this emotional awareness work.  To improve my facilitation
skills, I plan to staff two (2)
<a href="https://nwta.mkp.org">New Warrior Training Adventure</a> weekends, back
to back in March and April.  (full disclosure, I will also attend the
MKP Face to Face Gathering in March, but I do not completely know what
that will include.)</p>

<p>To this end, Jeremy was like, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you put together a Gofundme
page to help raise money for the trip?&rdquo;  Wow great idea!  Then Michael
was like, &ldquo;the trip is just the starting point; let&rsquo;s start Mankind
Project Japan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He worked out a bare bones budget for 2019, but it is still beyond
what I have ever thought about.  Life changing work.</p>
