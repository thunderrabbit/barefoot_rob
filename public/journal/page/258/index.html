<p>I thought I already had __block before variables that needed it, but I did not.</p>

<p>Adding __block in two (2) places seems to have been the magic touch I needed.</p>

<p>However, I have to deal with Apple&rsquo;s lovely provisioning process; I added Jimmy&rsquo;s phone to the available devices and now the app won&rsquo;t validate with Apple.  gah</p>

<p>I get this super precise incredibly unhelpful error message:</p>

<p><a href="/images/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-02-09-at-11.04.25-PM.png"><img src="/images/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-02-09-at-11.04.25-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2013-02-09 at 11.04.25 PM" /></a></p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t quote it because I don&rsquo;t have a solution, but I&rsquo;ll be looking for the solution soon enough. (I can still submit ad hoc versions for our dev testers so I don&rsquo;t care until it&rsquo;s time to submit the app to Apple.)</p>

<p>Lin and I &ldquo;babysat&rdquo; for her sister&rsquo;s daughter Mikako, nicknamed Mikarin. We played memory with a full deck of cards and each won once. We played Othello twice (Mikako beat me, then I beat Lin). Lin took a nap; we all ate cake.</p>

<p>Then when Baba got back to the house, we ate at the smokey restaurant and then Lin and I went home.</p>

<p>Thanks to the incredible <a href="https://simaquarium.com/">Sim Aquarium 3D</a> we have an aquarium above our kitchen sink!</p>

<p>What an amazing world.</p>

<p>I can see several points where the app could be improved with future technology, but I&rsquo;ve honestly never seen any computer technology so closely approach the look of a live aquarium.</p>

<p>My suggested future development, possibly in order of easiest to hardest:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>larger background so rotating the device doesn&rsquo;t force zoom-in</p></li>

<li><p>make fish out of focus when further away</p></li>

<li><p>add crustaceans</p></li>

<li><p>give fish some flaws (nibbled tails, scratches)</p></li>

<li><p>add dust particles when fish swim near the bottom</p></li>

<li><p>let the fish interact with each other (schools, chasing, fighting)</p></li>

<li><p>make the background 3D instead of just an image</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So I was using <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/12735/how-to-make-a-simple-playing-card-game-with-multiplayer-and-bluetooth-part-1">Ray Wenderlich&rsquo;s Snap! tutorial</a> as the basis for our new card game.   Unfortunately, the app kept having random memory crashes.  Tariq was sure it must be due to some too big images or corrupted sound files.  I was sure it had to do with my naive use of blocks.  Unfortunately, I was right.</p>

<p>I compared my code with the code in the tutorial and found that at no place did they use blocks in calls between classes.  In my app, blocks between classes was a defining feature&hellip;  I still honestly don&rsquo;t know why that should make the app crash; in each case, I am sure the calling class still existed.  It didn&rsquo;t seem to be a case of zombie blocks either, where ARC keeps the block alive which keeps the caller alive, which keeps the block alive fo-eva-eva.</p>

<p>But crash it did, and now I&rsquo;m off to find some more block tutorials; I gotta get this stuff sorted as blocks seem to be a staple for iOS apps these days.</p>

<p>In my mind, the crashes were happening because the memory got all twisted up.  It reminds me of a lecture from one of my astronomy professors at UH.  He was explaining the rotation of the sun at its equator is faster than the rotation at the poles.  This causes a twisting of the magnetic fields which ultimately ends up with a reversal of the sun&rsquo;s poles.  But he said, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t know exactly why the sun&rsquo;s magnetic poles reverse; the best we can tell is that the magnetic field lines get so twisted up that the sun just gets <strong>mad</strong> and reverses its poles.&rdquo;</p>

                        <p>##06:11 Wednesday 06 February 2013</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s 4:17am as I start this entry; it was 30 minutes ago that I went <em>back</em> to bed after waking up to pee and note that it&rsquo;s <em>not</em> snowing outside.</p>

<p>Lin&rsquo;s news sources said it would snow tomorrow.  Her mom&rsquo;s news sources said it would snow between 10 and 20 cm tomorrow.  My weather app says it will rain tomorrow, and so far, my app is right.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d love a snow day, not that I get the day off, but I like watching the snow fall, the footsteps, tire tracks, shovels all smush, squish, or whoosh the snow out of the way, and then watch the dirty snow slowly melt from its piles.</p>

<p>I noted that the weather forecast on the news showed a cutesy picture with three panels, making extremely clear the plan for people tomorrow.  The panels showed a car with tire chains, one more I can&rsquo;t remember, and a guy waking up early.  I complained to Lin that Japanese culture is too cutesy, and too caretaking.  Why make such a point to tell people that they have to wake up early tomorrow?  I can imagine a newscaster in the US closing the segment with &ldquo;.. might have to wake up early tomorrow.&rdquo; before moving on to the next story.</p>

<p>I was like, &ldquo;yeah, in the US they wouldn&rsquo;t spend 5 minutes showing an info graphic of what time people should wake up.  They&rsquo;d spend ten minutes telling who had killed whom, and, um, nevermind.&rdquo;</p>

<hr />

<p>Lin and I have been doing extremely well; I know we&rsquo;ve only been married 18 months or so, but we&rsquo;re still in that giddy &ldquo;no, I love <em>you</em> more!!&rdquo; phase, and I&rsquo;m really enjoying that.</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s just gotten a new job that does <em>not</em> require forced, unpaid overtime, and even allows 30 minutes of break in addition to an hour lunch!  Wow what an amazing concept of keeping workers happy.  In her two previous jobs, people were so stressed to the point of being sick (not just sick, but like ulcers and doctors orders to take time off) that I was like, &ldquo;yeah you should probably quit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, we&rsquo;re on day #22 (or so; it&rsquo;s been a while, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s been a month) of saying, &ldquo;dude; let&rsquo;s move to Taiwan,&rdquo; so the plan is to keep working here a bit, save some money and then start looking to change countries, esp. to one her mom will also enjoy living or at least visiting.</p>

<p>Every time we greet each other, we bark up a storm (why&rsquo;d I use &ldquo;up a storm&rdquo; here?  weird) and are just so <em>happy</em> to see each other.</p>

<hr />

<p>For the past month or so, I&rsquo;ve been nearly daily reading <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, and at the bottom of one of the stories, I saw something like &ldquo;rilakkumaaaaaaaa likes this.&ldquo;  I thought &ldquo;oh, that&rsquo;s from <a href="https://www.san-x.co.jp/rilakkuma/">リラックマ</a>,&rdquo; some bear character whose name comes from the combination of &ldquo;relax&rdquo; meaning relax in English, and &ldquo;kuma&rdquo; a transliteration for the word that means bear in Japanese.</p>

<p><a href="/images/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-02-06-at-4.49.38-AM.png"><img src="/images/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-02-06-at-4.49.38-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2013-02-06 at 4.49.38 AM" /></a></p>

<p>I translate their names as &ldquo;yellow bird,&rdquo; &ldquo;baby relax bear,&rdquo; and &ldquo;relax bear.&ldquo;  I guess the names are as good as &ldquo;big bird,&rdquo; &ldquo;cookie monster,&rdquo; and &ldquo;oscar the grouch.&ldquo;   (But <em>not</em> as good as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Snuffleupagus">Snuffleupagus</a>.)</p>

<p>But so anyway, I clicked the <a href="https://rilakkumaaaaaaaa.tumblr.com/">link to Rilakkumaaa&hellip;aa&rsquo;s page</a>, and I liked its content enough to come back a few times.   The author seems to post stories that have been posted by others (of stories that have been posted by others (of stories that have been posted by others (&hellip;))).  I clicked around in the group of cross posters and found an interesting style of animated images that I had not previously seen.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if I can capture them here in the same way, but I&rsquo;d describe them as multiple panels of the same scene, taken from (slightly) different points of view, in slightly different points of time.</p>

<p>Because a lot of the sites had a lot of these types of animation sets, I wonder who produced the animations in the first place?  Okay, yes, obviously they gifs made from videos, but who takes the time to clip out slightly different time segments possibly from different cameras and paste them together in an easily posted format?</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the apparent source of one photoset that&rsquo;s been reposted more than a few times: <a href="https://sarangtaeyeon.tumblr.com/post/31577460442/tiffany-mirror-mirror-who-is-the-prettiest-in">https://sarangtaeyeon.tumblr.com/post/31577460442/tiffany-mirror-mirror-who-is-the-prettiest-in</a></p>

<p>While downloading them to post here, I noted the tag #akb48, which I assume means these girls are in the currently popular group <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKB48#Reception">AKB48</a>, of which I know very little except they&rsquo;ve got a lot of fans.  One or more of them must have created these images.   Thank you, people, for making an interesting visual effect!</p>

<p>At work, we&rsquo;ve been migrating our dev boxes and some smaller client sites to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>.  I&rsquo;ve been updating to our latest style framework the back-end website for sending newsletters to people.  The system now uses Amazon SES.  We plan to test-move our larger clients to AWS within a couple months.</p>

<p>I had a client request conversion of a field from a text field to a dropdown list (because she prefers mouse over keyboard).   I looked at the data and found over 200 different values in the database and advised against such a change.  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll be very happy with a 210-item drop down list, esp if you have to visit a different page to add items.&rdquo;</p>

<hr />

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="https://trello.com/">trello</a> to keep track of little &ldquo;next steps&rdquo; in my projects both at home and work.  These may include notes to self to help my brain get back on track in the morning, and to protect against memory loss when being <a href="https://www.hadermann.be/blog/46/the-hidden-cost-of-interrupting-knowledge-workers/">inter</a><a href="https://blog.ninlabs.com/2013/01/programmer-interrupted/">rupted</a>. My list to start &ldquo;tomorrow&rdquo; (it&rsquo;s now 5:30am on said day) looks like this.</p>

<hr />

<p>Why haven&rsquo;t I been blogging a lot?  I guess because it takes a lot of time to write a lot and post accompanying pics.</p>

<hr />

<p>Tariq and I have been dealing with a memory issue in our latest (which is also our first) game.  I was like, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s gotta be because of the blocks&rdquo;  (it&rsquo;s my first time to use blocks in a project.  He was like, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s gotta be an error in some of the assets.&ldquo;   I wrote a version to load all the assets and it didn&rsquo;t always crash.   Then I compared the block usage in my app to the block usage in Snap!, from which I based some of the core code.   Oh snap, it&rsquo;s totally different!  I almost certainly need to completely redesign the underlying structure of my classes.   sigh.</p>

<hr />

<p>Well, last night, when the news assured us it would snow today, we went to bed early so we could wake up early and go get breakfast near Lin&rsquo;s office so she&rsquo;d be at work on time for her fourth day of work.   We planned to leave at 6:10am, which is now, but there&rsquo;s no snow, so the trains will be on time, and no reason to try to go early.  So I&rsquo;m going back to bed for an hour.</p>

<p>I wonder if I will meditate for 30 minutes when I wake up.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m trying to get some work done; I&rsquo;m trying to give my time and money to Apple so I have a chance to make a nickel.</p>

<p>Why is the provisioning process so obtuse?  Am I just an idiot who can&rsquo;t figure it out?</p>

<p>Why does Xcode have so many bugs?  Did I write it?</p>

<p>As I write this, Xcode is locked up.  Apparently I&rsquo;m going to have to force close it.</p>

<p>See how that little spinner isn&rsquo;t spinning in this image?  That&rsquo;s exactly how it&rsquo;s not spinning on my computer.</p>

<p><em>Dusk was approaching on a rainy night and we got a knock at the door. I opened it and a western looking guy wearing a backpack introduced himself. &ldquo;HI; I&rsquo;m Joe from Nagano,&rdquo; and I interrupted him, &ldquo;you came from Nagano??&rdquo; &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. &ldquo;Okay sorry please continue..&rdquo; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m was working in IT there but lost my job so I&rsquo;m looking for IT work in Tokyo..&rdquo; He was dripping a bit with rain, so I offered him to come in. He stepped up onto the wooden entry and I said &ldquo;shoes off outside, please&rdquo; and he stepped back outside. I then said &ldquo;wait. I don&rsquo;t personally have work for you, but I have a contact who might. You look cold, so I&rsquo;m offering to give you a warm place to sleep for tonight, BUT there is still some light outside; you can push on and maybe find a job, or you can come inside; it will be dark in about 30 minutes; you can come back after visiting a couple more houses.</em></p>

<p>He considered the options for a minute and then came inside. I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Rob and this is Sabina,&rdquo; as Sabina came up to see the visitor. She&rsquo;s traveling as well so may be able to give a few tips on making money in Japan.
Sabina started asking him questions animatedly, and they hit it off right away. She took him into her room and closed the door; I could hear them talking as I started doing dishes, washing a large tray with a painted tree on it, actually a large tree in a forest of trees, with lots of green deep green with some of the paint chipping off. I started to scrape more paint off while washing and thought I should have gotten back in touch with Sabina sooner because now she&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;m just getting back to her because she has a new friend and she&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;m jealous. But really I&rsquo;ve wanted to get back in touch the whole time but just didn&rsquo;t know what to say. So I made a decision to talk to her as soon as possible when she came back out of her room and then I woke up.</p>

<p>Browsing through free apps, I found <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/18-000-cool-jokes/id316973071?mt=8">18000 cool jokes</a>. Its meta-data includes</p>

<pre><code>———————————————
EXAMPLE JOKE FROM THE APP
———————————————
&quot;If there are any idiots in the room, will they please stand up?&quot; said the sarcastic teacher.
After a long silence, one freshman rose to his feet.
&quot;Now then mister, why do you consider yourself an idiot?&quot; enquired the teacher with a sneer
&quot;Well, actually I don't...&quot; said the student, &quot;...but I have to 
see you standing up there all by yourself.&quot;

<p>I noticed &ldquo;have&rdquo; where they should have &ldquo;hate&rdquo; hahah ooops.</p>

<p>Looks like it&rsquo;s been that way for a while, but not since the beginning</p>
