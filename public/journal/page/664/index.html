                        <p><title>Bought new printer</title></p>

<p class=date>21 July 1998</p>

<p>Today I purchased a new printer.  It's a Canon BJC-4300. Prints black & white and color (without changing cartridges) up to 5 pages per minute b/w um,..  760 x 760 dpi and can be converted into a 360dpi scanner if I but some other attachment thing.  Hmmm.  $179 + tax from Office Max.

<p>So I'm still using Windows 98. I have decided that Win98 was installed on D:\Windows like I asked, but overwrote the boot partition on C:  so when I tell the LILO prompt to boot Win95, it goes to the C: boot partition and it says D:\Windows which is Win98.  Makes sense, but I'd still like to fix it.

<p>Today at the laundry mat Lynda White walked in!  Oh my god I haven't seen her in 7 years!  We went to Tomball High School together, graduating in 1988.  How totally freaky!
<br>We saw each other and did a double take and I said, "holy shit," and she said, "hi Rob," like it was nothin'.

<p>Then big big big big big hugs and traded phone numbers and stuff.  She lives 1 mile away from me.. has been there for a year now.  Wow!!!!

<p>I still can't check my email that may be on my flashnet account.  (Can you tell me what the post office is????)   

<p>I gotta split for gymnastics!  (pun intended!)  see ya!

                        <p><title>Installed Windows 98</title></p>

<p class=date>20 July 1998</p>

<p>About a week ago, I got a Windows 98 CD and a new hard drive
onto which to install it .  My goal was to have three separate
bootable partitions:  Windows 95, Windows 98, and linux.

<p>Each time I tried to install Windows 98, it tried to overwrite
Windows 95.  I didn't want that because I don't trust Microsoft 
to have written a good enough OS that I'll want to keep it.

<p>I physically removed the two drives that have Win95 and linux on
them and installed Win98 on the remaining drive.

<p>That worked, but when I reinserted the two drives, it didn't
work.  I used linux partition manager to allow me to choose Win95
or linux or Win98.  The first two worked, but Win98 would halt
the system when it tried to load.

<p>I guessed that was because I changed the drive letter by 
removing and adding hard drives.  Okay, that makes sense, and I
didn't get terribly pissed off at Microsoft.

<p><hr align="left" width="25%">

<p>So last night I had thought of a new idea..  Install Win95 on
the third drive, then boot with that Win95 and install Win98 on 
top of *that* Win95 partition!     Delightful!

<p>I installed Win95 on the partition with no problem.  I assume
it was on that partition because I explicitly selected D:\Windows
as the directory into which to install, and had to confirm that
this drive designation was okay and changing this should only be
done by expert users.  yes yes yes it's fine.

<p>I was not too surprised when after the install I found Win95 had
squashed the linux partition
manager so I would have to reinstall it to allow me to boot Linux
or Win95 or Win95[2].

<p>Since I had selected drive D: so carefully, I assumed the system
was booting the Win95 partition on drive D.  Right?  

<p>I installed Win98. This time, it gave me the option of which
drive to install on. I chose drive D (short for "Duh, why didn't
you give me this option last time???") and it installed.

<p>Foreshadowing: (The procedure for installing Windows98 takes "between 30 and 
60 minutes, depending on the speed of your computer."  It took 
mine 47 minutes.) I mention this only to give you an idea of the
frustration level coming up.

<p>I rebooted and it came up Windows98 automatically. No surprise.

<p>So I started with my Linux boot.img disk and added installed
the linux partition manager.  I labeled the partitions Win95, 
linux and Win98.

<p>Rebooted and the partition manager prompt came up:

<p><pre>LILO:
</pre>

<p>This means "which partition should I load?"

<p>I entered "linux" and it booted linux beautifully.

<p>I rebooted and this time entered Win95.  Windows 98 came up.

<p>Oh shit.  Oh wait. Maybe I got the two switched around.

<p>I rebooted and this time entered Win98.  The system halted.

<p>Microsoft I hate you.

<p>From a DOS prompt, it appears that all my Win95 stuff is still
there, but it sure is not available from Win98. I don't know how
to make it available either.  What a pisser.

<p>I went to bed, and at some point had a dream that I got Win98 
uninstalled and all was good.

<p>This morning I woke up lamenting my loss and trying to figure
out how to resolve everything.  I booted from my Win98 DOS prompt
disk and read the help file and it said to unistall Win98, simply
type uninstall at the DOS prompt.

<p>It didn't say from what directory, so I found the executable 
and the executable said it could only be run from within Windows98.

<p>Fine. So I booted Windows98 and ran uninstall and it gave me
some ominous warning, something like,

<p><pre>"Microsoft writes crappy code. Continue?"</pre>

<p>I did not continue.  I'll call my friend Thomas who is Microsoft 
Certified and see if he has any ideas.

<p>So for now, I'm using Linux to access the Internet and write
my journal entries.

<p class=date>20 July 1998</p>

<p>Well, I haven't heard from Thomas to help me get Windows 98 off of my machine here, so I decided to use it.  I got my connection to Flashnet going easily enough, and got Netscape Communicator configured, but I have no frikkin' idea what Windows Messaging means by my "post office"

<p>"Please enter the path to your post office," it says.

<p>What?  What the hell are you talking about?  Is there a post office on my PC?  Is it mail.flash.net?  What do you mean?  

<p>argh.

<p>So I cannot as of yet read my mail, but don't worry; I will keep working on this.

<p>I did find that my C: drive appears to be intact.  All the shortcuts are still in the C:\Windows\Desktop directory, and I just copied them over to my Win98 desktop.  Most of them didn't work though; they are looking for some DLL or another.

<p>So I can't work on my budget or me snail mail database or anything interesting.  But I can access the web.

<p>"So what, Rob," you may ask, "do you think of Windows 98?"

<p>Well, it just looks like a cute-i-fied version of Win95.  The opening screen is flashier.  You can single click on icons to open them.  Windows Explorer looks like Internet Explorer. 

<p>But it sure as hell isn't any easier to set up than Win95. What's a post office?  Why did you eat my Win95 partition? Where's this super fast speed you were talking about?

<p>I'm unimpressed with how much Win98 has advertising everywhere.  Not like commercials on TV, but practically so with this new "Channel Guide" thing and the few specific ISPs that are suggested when I first tried to set up my ISP...

<p>But, it's only been 1 day; we'll see how I feel about it tomorrow.

                        <p><title>lock-in and beach cleanup</title></p>

<p class=date>Saturday 18 July 1998</p>

<p>Last night Wende and I went to the Post GA Participant Party and it was cool.  10 of us were there, and I felt a nice balance between talkative and listenative.

<p>When we left the weather was storming and I came home and turned off my PC in case the power went out.  Then I cruised to the youth lock-in at First Church.

<p>I got there around 10pm and the youth were being fairly rambunctious, but still not too crazy.  We watched <em>Father of the Bride II</em> then they were super wild and rambuncitous, throwing balls in a team keep-away game and wrestling and general running around.

<p>Once they wore themselves out, we organized (with some difficulty) a "fishbowl" .. designed to help the youth bond.

<p><blockquote>(the way we wanted it to work was have everyone write a question that each individual in the group would answer out loud to the group.  They wrote the questions okay, but we could not get everyone to respect those who were talking and to not talk while others were answering the questions.)</blockquote>

<p>By the end it was 4:30 in the morning and I went to sleep for 2 hours before Adam and I left for the beach cleanup at 7pm.

<p><hr align="left" width="25%">

<p>Benjamin, a young adult who I met at GA showed up at the church at 6:45am to join us to the beach.

<p>I woke up Adam and we vacated to group up at Thoreau Congregation to caravan to Galveston Island State Park, where we were to clean up.

<p>Got to Thoreau at 7:31am and got to the Park at 9am and got some garbage bags from the park ranger and we were on our way!

<p>Most of the youth took the full-tilt-go-grab-big-trash-stuff
technique while I and a couple other adults took the walk-slowly-precision-pick-up-stuff technique.

<p>Both techniques worked well.

<p>During the cleanup, I found some well worn pieces of glass bottles that had been broken but were no longer sharp. sand..glass.. makes sense, right?  right.
<br>so anyway, I decided to collect all the broken though smooth pieces of glass I found and make a stained glass window out of them.  I now have a bag essentially full of smooth broken glass.

<p>I collected about 1 trashbag worth of stuff and then took a wade with Wende, Shawn & Amy, and then I took a nap.

<p>Drove home and chilled for like 1 hour and then Wende and I went to see <em>Lethal Weapon 4</em>.

<p class=date>4:30pm Saturday 18 July 1998</p>
<br><font size=-1>movie started at 4:30</font>

<p>Wende and I saw Lethal Weapon 4, and it was really good.

<p>I was quite impressed with the script and scenarios and stuff.  It was only predictable in that the good guys didn't die.  Otherwise it kept me riveted and laughing.

<p>Wende gripped my hand so tightly that her fingers fell asleep.
"I certainly had to flex them to get feeling back into them," she said.

<p>The movie was great, especially for a #4 in a series.  Wow!!

<p><hr align="left" width="25%">

<p>After the movie, we had a great heart-to-heart discussion for 2.25 hours about us and life and ourselves and goals and fears and relationships and stuff.  I feel greatly honored that Wende and I can talk about these things, even though it is difficult.

<p>At one point, I cried during our conversation, when describing my fears that quitting my job was the wrong thing to do and that I would not be able to make enough money otherwise.
<br>I am pleased that I can cry when I need to.

<pre>15 July 1998

Hi Rob,

This is just to let you know that you will be going to Con Con this
year after all.  I have now put a confirmation letter and travel form
in today's mail and you should receive it soon.  The travel form was
supposed to have been mailed back to me by July 13.  But not to worry.
If you have access to a fax machine, could you please fax the form to
my attention after you complete it and then mail me the hard copy. Or
just drop the form in the mail to me at your earliest convenience if
you can't fax it.  As long as I get the completed form in the next two
weeks, everything will be cool.  You will also receive a pre-packet in
the mail in the next week or so.  No pre-packets have gone out yet to
anyone else coming to Con Con but we are working very hard to finish
the pre-packet and get it mailed off to everyone by this Friday at the
latest.
</pre>

<p></p></p>

<p>Today after seeing Armageddon, but before gymnastics, I stopped by Smoothie King to get a smoothie.  I told the guy they should have a smoothie flavor called "groovy juice."

<p>"Groovy juice, eh?"

<p>"Yeah.. let me tell you what's in it."  I looked up at the ingredients list. "Um, wheat germ, bananas, soy protein, turbinado and honey."

<p>"That's it?"

<p>"Yeah.  This time."

<p>"do you want any fruit juices?"

<p>"whaddya got?"

<p>He rattled them off and I chose mango.

<p>I paid the cashier dude and the other guy handed me the smoothie.  "Here's your groovy juice."

<p>"Thanks!"  The weird thing is that I didn't even notice until after I left that he called it groovy juice!

<p>I slurped it down on the way to gymnastics, and I was so so so super energetic there!

<p>I stretched and chatted and we did the small tumbling passes: handstands, then cartwheels, then roundoffs..  And then I did round-off flips that were essentially pike position, but not layed out.

<p>BB encouraged me and gave me pointers and I kept going and going and the flips kept getting better and closer to layouts!
I was so energetic and kept going even while several of the others in line began to sit out a turn.

<p>Eating before gymnastics helps so much!!!!

<p>At about 5 minutes before time to go, I went to the big trampoline and did flips and flips and flips and was pretty much able to jump, flip and land at the same point on the trampoline. That was cool.

<p>Said bye to everyone and here I am!

<p class=date>14 July  1998</p>

<p>Today I went to see <em>Armageddon</em> with Emilio, who I used to work with at the outpatient pharmacy at St Joseph Hospital.

<p>The movie was pretty cool, except for the blatant physics errors, just like in <em>Deep Impact</em>.

<p>For example, the asteroid's mass was apparently sufficient to affect a 1 g attraction on everything.

<p>On the cool technical effects side, they blew up a famous city.

<p>My favorite favorite scene was near the end. The flickering superimposed images grabbed my emotions and I cried and cried.
<br>(does that give away too much?)

<p>If you can look past the physics errors, go check it out.  Lots of action and good special effects.  The characters were well developed and though the ending was predictable, it was still a tear jerker for me.

<p class=date>5:45am Sunday 12 July 1998</p>

<p>"Yesterday" when I was sleeping outside I woke up around 4am and wrote down a dream and thought "I should create a section of my webpage devoted to dreams"

<p>I came up with a 'lucidity scale' and stuff, too.

<p>This morning I woke up at 4:30 and wrote down another dream. This one I have transcribed onto my website and called "Life Spans" and will likely make a copy of it available in my Gravity section.

<p>I found that I already had some dreams mixed in here with my
journal entries.  After much deliberation, I have decided to move them
to my dream section, which is at www.geocities.com/~thunderrabbit/dreams/1998.
</p>

<p class=note>july 2003: that site is long gone, but the dreams are <a
href="/writing/old/writing/dreams/">here</a></p>

<p class=date>11 July 1998</p>

<p>Each day this week, I've been working at the New Warrior Lodge.  (see <a href="https://Nottingham.com/warrior/">Men In Mission</a> for details) The biggest thing we did this week was mail out a couple hundred directories of men who have completed the training.  The coolest thing about the work is I get a hug each time I come in to the "office" and I don't have to wear shoes.

<p>Today after working at the Lodge, I did email and caught up with a lot of messages and updated the two youth group websites that I maintain, and actually updated the front page of a third youth website.

<p>I was stir crazy (whatever that means) and decided to go skating. I skated to the bank and deposited a check and went to Walgreen's and got some solution for my contacts. That took only 10 minutes and I wanted to skate more.

<p>So I dropped of the contact solution at my apartment and went back to the intersection of Taft and Allen Parkway.

<p>It's been totally hot as hell... like around 100 degrees, so I was sweatin' like crazy just getting near the intersection. 

<p>Panting, I watched the traffic light down the hill from me.  I counted off the 60 seconds until it was time for me to race down the hill to the intersection.  I got to 40 and the light turned green...  waitasecond!  I was expecting it to not change yet.. 

<p>So I stopped and recalibrated my timer..  I needed to count only 30 seconds.  Okay, fine.

<p>I skated back to the fire hydrant which is my starting marker. The traffic moved, indicating when I started my mental timer.  1...2...3...4... all the way up to 30 and

<pre>go go go go go go go</pre>

<p>down the hill and the light turned green perfectly on time and zoooom across the intersection to the first median and I paused there. None of this instant across the street ..  wait it's a big enough gap, so I zipped across the last 4 lanes and to the safety of the sidewalk.   Too easy.

<p>"Too easy!" I yelled.  "Too too easy."

<p>It was not so easy getting back across.  

<p>Like a caged beast, I paced up and down the sidewalk, looking for a break in the rush hour traffic.  Up the sidewalk.. nothing but cars whizzing by at 50 to 60 miles per hour.

<p>Down the sidewalk and nothing but cars whizzing by at 50 to 60 miles per hour.. It was the ultimate game of Frogger.

<p>and then I saw it, a break in the traffic and I skated off the curb into the first lane and then <em>zip</em> a car changed lanes, closing off my chosen path.    Back onto to the curb I stepped.

<p>Back up the sidewalk, looking for my moment to cross.  

<p>Back down, and finally on the back up again pass, I found it and zipped across to the median.  Yeah.

<p>From the median I zipped across the remainder of the street  and up to my starting point again.  Well maybe not zipped... I was plenty hot and just ambled my way up.

<p>I had to do it again..  that first time had just been too easy.

<p>From the fire hydrant I counted off 30 seconds.  Many cars and a two pickup trucks were now in line at my light.  I reached 30 seconds and began my race down the hill.  

<p>Down between the two lanes of cars I cruised, hoping that they wouldn't squish me as they got to move.. I changed my concern, though, as the light seemed to take spectacularly long to turn green, so I hoped simply the light would turn green for me.

<p>Just at the moment of abort, <em>green</em> and I zipped into the intersection before any of the cars began to move.  Aww yeah.

<p>To the median I sped and stopped there.. didn't even try to go all the way across.  I had to get back home for a shower before meeting Wende, Maggie and John for dinner at La Jaliscience.

<p>I ambled across the street and up the hill even more slowly and was so totally sauna-style hot and sweaty by the time I got back to my apartment..

<p>Took a shower, starting with pretty warm water so as to not send my body into shock.. slowly cooled it down till the hot water was totally off and I was basking in only cold water.

<p>Out of the shower and I was still hot, but had recovered by the time Wende and I got to the restaurant.

<p><font size=-1>(it's 11:30pm and I'm about to go to bed so I'll be quick)</font>

<p>John couldn't make it, so we called Eric and he said he would join us and then John showed up and then Eric showed up so all five of us ate and chilled and John decided to not join us for the IMax movie.

<p>I rode with Maggie in her new red Ford Mustang soft top convertible and we chilled at the museum until the movie.

<p><b>AMAZON</b> was the IMax movie, and the images were incredible, reminding me how much I really wanna go there.. especially seeing a railroad track wind around the sides of mountains!!  Totally wild.  The storyline they added was pretty hoaky, but oh well.

<p>Movie ended and we came home and here I am.

<p>I've decided to sleep outside on the top of the back staircase of my apartment building.. just because I can.

<p>good night.
