<p>I did sleep after riding my bike to 1/2 Price Books to purchase
<em>Miracle of Mindfulness</em>, which they didn't have, but they did
have a Power Puff Girls little diary looking thing, including a pen
holder, so I bought that to be my yoga journal.</p>

<p>Got home, transcribed my yoga journal notes to my new PPG journal
and then took a nap.</p>

<p>Oh!! I got to see our old house!  I rode by just to check it out,
and the new owner was there.  She welcomed me in (even though we had
never previously met) and I love what she's done.  Lots of colors and
cool funky furniture.  Quite amazingly different and yet still the same
house.  So great to see it so well loved.</p>

<p>On the way home I stopped by the old movie theater which is being
torn down.  A guy named Brent happened to be there taking pictures with
his digital camera, so I gave him my email address.  He may send them
to me, and if he does, I may put them on my site (with his permission,
of course)</p>

<p>Now I'm at Dude and Veronica's.  Got to hang out with them and Gene;
Veronica made great southwestern casserole so we munched that while
they shared stories of the MS 150 which was this past weekend.</p>

<p>I have just moved online the rest of my pics from <a

2</a> of me-an-Bryn's London adventure.</p>

<p>Rode my bike to I-group tonight.  Zero wrecks this time; I didn't
try as much wacky stuff.  Cars still got in my way though.  From
Richmond, I rode along the inside of 610 loop once I reached it.  Then
under 610 along Westheimer and huge bunny hops over parking lot curbs
three in a row as I sped diagonally across the parking lot.  Fun.</p>

<p>During I-group, I told them of my fear in going to Japan.  I was
pretty quickly able to recognize that my fear is simply of the
unknown, just as I had fear around going to Paris before Bryn and I
went.  The Paris trip was fantastic; why should Japan be any
different?  That's right.  It will be equally fantastic, but even more
so.</p>

<p>Rode my bike home, and from Richmond/610 interchange I rode through
the 2 foot tall grass along the inside of 610 loop as it turned
backwards into highway 59, and along its feeder all the way backwards
to Newcastle.  That was strenuous.  Crossed under 59 on Newcastle and
rode north along 59 feeder all the way to Shepherd.  Equally strenuous
and more danger from traffic.  Didn't get squished though.</p>

RELEASE: 02-68

MASSIVE ICEBERGS MAY AFFECT ANTARCTIC SEA LIFE AND FOOD CHAIN

     NASA-funded research using satellite data has shown 
large icebergs that have broken off from Antarctica's Ross 
Ice Shelf are dramatically affecting the growth of minute 
plant life in the ocean around the region -- plant life vital 
to the local food chain.

Scientists say the icebergs appear to have caused a 40 
percent reduction in the size of the 2000-2001 plankton bloom 
in one of Antarctica's most biologically productive areas. 
The icebergs decrease the amount of open water that the 
plants need for reproduction. 

After the calving, or "breaking off," of the B-15 iceberg in 
March of 2000, researchers used imagery from NASA's SeaWiFS 
(Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor) satellite and data 
from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program to see the 
effect that large icebergs have on phytoplankton (minute 
floating plants) blooms. The B-15 iceberg that broke off the 
Ross Ice Shelf and drifted into the southwestern Ross Sea was 
as large as the state of Connecticut (approximately 10,000 
square kilometers or 3,900 square miles)

"This is the first time that satellite imagery has been used 
to document the potential for large icebergs to substantially 
alter the dynamics of a marine ecosystem," said Kevin Arrigo, 
a researcher at Stanford University, Stanford, Calif. Arrigo 
and his colleagues are publishing their results in a paper 
titled "Ecological Impact of a Large Antarctic Iceberg," in 
an upcoming issue of Geophysical Research Letters. 

NASA's Thorsten Markus of the Goddard Space Flight Center, 
Greenbelt, Md., a co-author on the paper, noted that SeaWiFS 
satellite imagery enabled researchers to see that large 
icebergs such as the B-15 restricted the normal drift of pack 
ice. Normally, when the winds shift, ice is carried out into 
the Ross Sea, creating open ocean space and a breeding ground 
for phytoplankton. The icebergs, however, created a blockage 
that resulted in heavier spring/summer pack-ice cover than 
previously recorded. 

Since the area of sea ice was more extensive, the area 
suitable for phytoplankton growth was reduced, and as a 
result, so was the length of the algal growing season. Since 
the B-15 iceberg was so large, plankton productivity 
throughout the region was more than 40 percent below normal. 

The southwestern Ross Sea is one of the most biologically 
productive regions in the Southern Ocean surrounding 
Antarctica. This is partly due to the large and persistent 
areas of open water that form during the Antarctic spring 
when pack ice drifts out of the Ross Sea. 

In the springtime, winds shift in the area of the Ross Sea 
and clear away sea ice, forming the Ross Sea polynya (an area 
of open water surrounded by sea ice) where phytoplankton 
flourish. However, when large icebergs calve, such as B-15, 
sea ice is not as easily moved by winds, severely reducing 
the area of open water. 

Phytoplankton are a critical part of the entire ecosystem in 
the Ross Sea, since they sustain marine mammals and birds in 
the region. During periods where there are no large icebergs, 
phytoplankton thrive, and so do those organisms that feed on 
them. The region also is home to 22 percent of the world 
population of circumpolar Emperor penguins and 30 percent of 
Adélie penguins. 

This research is a part of NASA's Earth Science Enterprise, a 
long-term research effort dedicated to help us better 
understand and protect our home planet.

<p>Wow.  My linux box clock set itself correctly over the weekend.  I
wonder if it though savings time started or ended this weekend.</p>

<p>Yesterday I went to YRUU, but no one showed up, so I studied
Japanese; now I'm pretty clear on all the hiragana, except for all the
ones with little quotes or circles beside them.  I almost know half of
those.</p>

<p>People did show up for SNOW (Sunday Night Of Worship), at which
there were several tears after stressful weekends.</p>

<p>I hung out with Amy for some hours afterward, sharing stories, and
answering some questions about her new leadership role in YRUU - local,
district and continental.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>This morning I met with Kim Sawyer, my personal coach at Empire
Cafe.  Good stuff.</p>

<p>Kim helped me reframe my work so that I am happier here, knowing
that this (work) is helping me get to Japan.</p>

<p class=date>12:03pm</p>

<p>Staff meeting was not entirely boring.  I've gotten 3 things done
from my list since then.</p>

<p class=date>1:47pm</p>

<p>Just went outside for a walk to see the wall that's being built
between the Shepherd exit ramp and the freeway.  Met a guy named Alvin
who said he went to jail in Louisiana, and got transferred to Houston
where he was released.  He's begging for money until he gets enough to
go back to LA.</p>

<p class=date>5:28pm</p>

<p>Aight; I'm outta here for the day.  Had a 2 hour productive
project-design meeting.  I think we will benefit from having these
before we start big projects.</p>

<p>I'm at KTRU now, playing some dreadfully long high pitch squealing
song called Song For the Rothko Chapel (part 1).  Don't worry if you
missed it.</p>

<p>Marcel's was fun today; in addition to scoping out his Mac, we
played frisbee a bit while his 2 girls and 1 neice played on the slide
in the front yard.  (we were in the front yard too)</p>

<p>When we picked up his car, I was chillin' in the other car with the
three girls in the back seat.  They found endless pleasure in mailing
me letters through the "slot" between the seat and headrest.  I read
the "mail" (church flyers) as if it were interesting mail and they
giggled with delight.</p>

<p>I'm pretty much set on getting an iBook; I just need to decide what
specifications and find a good inexpensive place to purchase it.</p>

<p>Oh, this journal entry is called ktru.  Let me tell you, this is my
first show in a month it seems, and I made *so* many errors in the
first hour or so.  I started to say 1999 as part of the date, I left
the mic on while answering a phone (which was just as I pushed [eject]
instead of [play] on the CD player.  Yeah that sucked), I said ska
instead of reggae when announcing the reggae show, and some others I
don't remember.  Wow.</p>

<p>Welcome back!</p>

<p>The past hour+ has been pretty good/smooth.</p>

Funny that you're too busy to call, but not too busy

It'll have to be next week.  Perhaps next Tuesday will

<p>Walking to lunch today, I stopped by 1/4 Price Books and asked for
<em>Miracle of Mindfulness</em>, though I didn't know who had written
it.  Larry, the owner, suggested it could be Tic Naht Hanh (sp!!), but
he (Larry) didn't think he had the book in the store.  I found a book
by Ramm Das and got that instead.</p>

<p>Paid with a $20, and took most of the change in Larry's drawer, so
at lunch, I broke another $20, then brought four $5s back to Larry to
buy back the $20.  He said, "A guy like you should be writing books,
not just reading them."</p>

<p>Wonderful compliment.</p>

<p>With all due respect to Ashley, I'm using the email I wrote to her
as a state of my life address.  I haven't written one in quite a
while.</p>

<pre>
From: Rob
Sent: Thursday, April 18, 2002 2:06 AM
To: Ashley

To be clear, I am looking only for friendship - I have just recently
dis-engaged from my girlfriend/fiance of 6 years.  I'm not all torn up about
it, but just am intentionally single now, and plan to stay single for a
while.

So, who is Rob?

I like to run around barefoot as much as possible.  I don't wear shoes to
work (unless I ride my bike or unicycle), and I just keep them somewhat
handy in case I need them to enter some restaurant or something.

I can ride a unicycle, though not incredibly well--just enough to ride
around on slighly non-flat surfaces.  I can ride down curbs on occassion,
but not up.  Speed bumps are usually no problem.  I learned how to ride a
couple years ago, after my brother (4 years younger) decided he was going to
learn how.

Thus began my decision to learn a new something each year.  That year was to
ride a unicycle.  The next year it was to learn Spanish.  This year I've
been learning sign language, French (a tiny(!) bit), and Japanese (slowly).
I haven't been practicing these much, but they are still in my head
somewhere.  I don't find many places to practice these languages in Houston.
I know there *are* places to hang out with deaf people, and other places to
hang out with Japanese people, and I'm sure I could find a french culture
here, but to hang out with these people would mean adding to or adjusting my
already busy schedule, which I'm somewhat loathe to do.

On Monday nights I am usually with my men's group.  <a href="https://www.mkp.org">https://www.mkp.org</a>.
This is a spiritual (but non-religious), nurturing, encouraging group of
men, who are pretty much all learning how to live life in integrity with
themselves and relationships with others.

Tuesday nights are open lately, so I will chill at my apartment or work on
my website.  Wednesday nights for a while had been Wednesday Night Dinner's
at Dude's house (his real name is Robert, but he's gone by Dude since he was
zero years old), but lately he's been at MCSE training, so that's off.
Tonight I went to MB (Mission Burrito (yummm)) with his wife Veronica.

Thursday nights are yoga (actually tomorrow night is my first night, but
hopefully it will last for some months), and Fridays are often free unless
they begin a weekend lock-in with my youth.

I'm a youth advisor for high school youth in YRUU <a href="https://www.uua.org/YRUU">https://www.uua.org/YRUU</a>,
an organization designed to give youth a safe place to create their own
programming - to learn leadership skills, to plan activities, to be socially
active, etc etc, all good stuff.  This is part of Unitarian Universalism, my
church, in which I've been raised all my life.

I'll quickly interject that I'm not super religious, and certainly don't buy
into the Christian mythology (if I may be so bold).  I am not a biblical
expert (and at this point don't intend to be), so I can't debate thoroughly,
but my favorite conversations are about the nature of god and the universe
and our lives and karma, dharma, etc.

I'm not religious, but I'm spiritual.  I remain in close contact with my
angels/spirit-guides/whatever, who are available for me all the time.  They
give me guidance when I ask, if I can just get my ego out of the way ;-)

Um, I enjoy keeping a random-ish schedule; I loathe the idea of going to
work at the same time each day, although that sorta turns out to be what I'm
doing lately.

For money, I'm a computer programmer for a small company that hosts
customized surveys online for big companies, mostly human resources
departments.  A company owner (our client) will be all, "what are people
thinking on the front lines of my company?" so they'll figure out a bunch of
specific questions to ask everyone, we put those questions online and let
everyone provide feedback.  Then we compile the responses into a report,
keeping everyone's individual data anonymous and send the report to the
owner/boss/whoever wanted the survey.

I have told *my* boss that I'll be leaving at the end of this year.  During
the year it's my intention to pay off my credit card debt $5000, save some $
and then move to Japan next year, after January 31st, when I'll celebrate my
12,000th day.

(I celebrate my 500 day anniversaries instead of years.  I have no problem
telling people my age (32 (you?)), but as of last year or so, I don't
celebrate my birthday.  My next age celebration is 31 January 2003, when
I'll turn 12,000 days old.  If we're still in touch after then, I'll let you
know when is the next one after that.)

I know 2 people who are in Japan now, teaching English.  As of August, 1
more of my friends will be doing the same thing.  While visiting Paris this
past March, I met some guys from Japan, and I may contact them to expand my
Japanese network.  And, my friend Lee-eh (intentionally misspelled so
English speakers pronounce it correctly) is from Japan, and said she'd be
willing to go back with me to show me around when I go.  She's the one who
is teaching me Japanese.

The three people I know who are or will be in Japan teaching English are all
from KTRU, 91.7fm, Rice Radio.  I'm a DJ there, and am on air every other
Saturday night or so.  This coming Saturday 20 April, I'll be on from 7 to
10pm.  Call during my shift and we can chat.  713-348-5878.  Or you can just
listen.  Or both.  Or whatever.

Okay, that's all for now, but I'll scan your email to answer specific
questions.

Why do I keep my journal online?  Hmmmm.  Partially to be famous.  Partially
because people say they enjoy reading what I write.  Partially to record my
life for my own reading enjoyment later.  Partially as a service to the
world, who may find it interesting to read about my life before I'm *really*
famous.  Partially as a service to my offspring (gotta have kids first
though) if they do any genealogical research.

Oh, you mentioned being active.  I ride my bike a lot, and play ultimate
frisbee on occasion, and inline skate on occasion, and ride my unicycle on
occasion.  I also don't like country dancing, but I do enjoy going to a
club, so long as it's not too smokey.  I do not do bump and grind dancing,
but my own Rob's Crazy Dance, where I take to heart the quote that ends,
"and dance like nobody's looking."  I dance to sweat.  To exercise.  I'm not
particulary fond of dancing in a specific style (swing/contra/etc) because I
get completely lost in the steps.  I just let the music move me.

Food:  I enjoy eating as well, and lately-ish, I've been more intentional
about eating well, but this is a skill that is taking me some time to form.
If good food were readily available to me, I'd definitely prefer it over
junk food.  Most of the time.  Or at least I'd probably eat the healthy food
first before I chow on the junk food.

Oh, and at the very front of your message you indicate that you're looking
for someone who values strong-minded women.  I certainly value
strong/intelligent/powerful minds, whether in men or women.  I encourage all
my friends to make the most of themselves - to stretch beyond their comfort
zones to do great things in the world.  So please, be strong-minded.

Somehow I'm led to mention that I'm not easily offended, except by humans
doing hateful things to one another, especially on a personal level.  I have
no problem with cursing, or bathroom humor, or see-food.  But I don't like
racism, sexism, culture-ism (I made that one up, but you may know what I
mean).

With that, I say, holy shit it's two am.  I'm going to bed.

    - Rob

<p>I just spent a bit over an hour (two?) composing an email about
myself for this girl/woman Ashley, who saw my entry on match.com.  I'm
careful to remain clear that I'm not looking for relationship.</p>

<p>Um, oh - today after work I visited Jennifer at Paint This! and
finished the soap dish.  This one looks ten times better than the
first one, which I painted in a rush with a big paint brush. I'm
thankful that it broke.  While there, I picked up my bike (spoke is
fixed; yay!) from University Schwinn.  Super thanks to Jeff for not
charging me for the fix!</p>

<p>I called Dude's house and Veronica answered, so I invited her to
munch at Mission Burrito.  (Dude is out of town until tomorrow night.)
While at MB, Ryan Ray came up all, "Rob?" and I couldn't remember his
name, but I asked him to say his sister's name, and I remembered his
immediately.  See, I knew his name was in my brain, but it was a bit
buried.</p>

<p>We talked quite several minutes, and I met his friend Eddie (which
I remember because of the cartoon Ed, Edd, and Eddie), who is quite
interested in traveling.  His face lit up when I mentioned that I'm
moving to Japan next year.  I *totally* encouraged him to travel just
for the experience.  Go go go go. Just do it.</p>

<p>Drove home, then carried Spot to my work so he'd have a fun
excursion.  He was meowing some and walked around the office some,
then came back over to me like he was done.  So I carried him back
home and then rode my bike back over to work.</p>

<p class=date>10:48pm CDT Tuesday 16 April 2002</p></p>

<p>Today I started working out my budget.  Just like in my post
college pay off student loan days (but not as much debt this time),
I'm going to knock out my debt and start saving some frogskins(*) for
my adventures.</p>

<p>I called my credit card company to make sure I knew of all the
pending transactions and found that the last three had been around $3
or $4 each.  I hardly remembered having done them.  Little charges
like that aren't helping, so I cut up my card.</p>

<p>So now I'm at work to use the internet and compare my budget to my
bank account online.</p>

<p>(*) Not that I ever actually use this term, nor that
<em>anyone</em> ever uses it, but I saw it in a BMX magazine a *long*
time ago, something like, "this bike will set you back 300
frogskins."  I thought it was hilarious.  Still do.</p>
