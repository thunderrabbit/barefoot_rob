<p>pretty fuckin' late.</p>

<p class=date>11:29pm</p>

<p>My evening is winding down.  I'm on my train now to head back home
from Kannai.  What a debacle getting to Kannai; in Shinagawa, the
train I wanted was waiting for me, which is pretty rare since it
doesn't run very frequently.  Tonight was even less frequent; the
train should have left 45 minutes previously.  That's fucked up late.
Turns out there had been some human incidents on the track.</p>

<p>(i.e. humans jumped in front of the train in their last desperate
solution to all the problems life in Japan has to offer.)</p>

<p>Took a <em>PACKED</em> train to Kawasaki and a <em>PACKED</em>
train to Yokohama, then got a tad lost finding the way to Kannai and
was directed to the train as opposed to the subway, though I clearly
(in English) said Kannai Subway, so when I arrived in Kannai I had to
walk 400 meters to the subway station, and as I was on the phone to
Shin, walking down into the subway station my phone cut out from being
too far underground.  Bah.</p>

<p>He found me and we walk walk walked to a Korean restaurant, while
being asked by bystanders if we wanted a drink or a massage.  Men
said, "nomigateka?" (maybe) and women said, "massaji, massaji?" and
one of them actually grabbed my arm as we walked by.  I wondered what
the experience might be like if I accepted her offer, or maybe acted
angry for her grabbing my arm.</p>

<p>I wonder if such a massage could actually help my aching arms.</p>

<p>Awesome first lesson with Yumi via Gateway 21.  She's apparently
leaving Japan in December; that's when she's quitting her
job. (Gateway 21 is a travel agency with a side business of teaching
the language where people are traveling, so I assume the reason she's
quitting is to roll out of here.)</p>

<p>Speaking of rolling out, I gotta split cause I may otherwise be
late for my thing with Shin.</p>

<p>Tonight Fumi took me to a building I had never heard of, but that
turns out I had wanted to visit since the second day I was in Japan.
This is the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Office or something like
that; a single building with two 55 story towers, each with a viewing
area on the 45th floor or so.  We took some time to scope the view
from each direction, and on the 7th of 8 windows I noticed... "wait a
minute!  That's the NOVA sign that I used as a landmark when I first
got here.  Oh yeah, it was Shinjuku station.. and that's where my
hotel was, and *that* must be the Nova main office... which makes
*these* the buildings I saw and wanted to explore!"</p>

<p>Tight.</p>

<p>So we went to that building and scoped the Huge Clock, and then
zipped over to Shinjuku station and I found the Gateway 21 office so I
can find it easily tomorrow.</p>

<p>Then I bought a 1000 yen suica (pass) for the JR lines and *then*
we ate ice cream.  I had an ice cream sandwich thing that basically
was ice cream in a hamburger bun shaped thing.  The bread was harder
than hamburger but softer than bagel, but basically tasteless.  I
determined that an ice cream filled doughnut would rule.</p>

<p>Went to Sankeien Garden near Sakuragicho, kinda tucked away in the
back alleys next to a neighborhood.  I was generally impressed with
the thick stone stockroom (into which we were not allowed), but
generally not so impressed with everything else.  I must be in a bad
mood.</p>

<p>I chatted with a cat named Kyo, and a woman named Chen.  Kyo is
from Burma, and Chen is from Taiwan.  She knows Mandarin, Cantonese,
English, Japanese.  Of course I don't know as much about Kyo, but he
seemed pretty cool and I gave him my email address so he could send me
some of the pics he took.</p>

<p>It was nice (the garden), but it was, I am guessing, far removed
from how it used to be.  Change happens, but they tried to pretend it
wasn't happening.  Fire extinguishers in ancient rooms, and concrete
benches made to look like wood.  Ah well.  whatever.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>My arms are sore as FUCK from those pushups I did.  Embarassingly
sore.  I did 44 pushups in 5 minutes and I'm paying for it now.  My
triceps (I think) are so tight that it's super painful to bend my
arms; I need to let them relax.  I've been self accupressuring them,
and thinking about accupuncture and wondering where the right spots
are to press.</p>

<p>Janette called this morning and woke me up from a dream where I was
in a school situation and watching trays in a cafeteria be stacked in
two different stacks like disks being shot out of a zebra disk gun.</p>

<p>I was sleepin' and she wanted to go bikin' before a storm and when
she called me back I was on Frank's computer typin' and stuff, and she
was like, "there's a CRAZY storm with rain in sheets," etc, I was
like, Mmmmmmm storms, and then "lemme call you back" but we got
disconnected before I could finish my sentence and her phone just
rings and rings, so I figure they had a power outage from lightning.
I trust she's okay.</p>

<p>Well.</p>

<p>I've got my computer back.  And it's absolutely *my* computer: the
data on the drive seems absolutely the same.  I'm most thankful for
that.</p>

<p>I will write to Jeff at Aloha Dude to get some more stickers.  (The
monkey and banana stickers were removed.)  Or maybe I won't.</p>

<p>The entire outer case is completely new.  There is still that
protective plastic sheeting on all the surfaces (except the
keyboard).  The keyboard is my old keyboard.  I can see the wear
marks.  That was the first indication that I wasn't starting
completely over with a whole new computer. </p>

<p>I'm really happy to have my computer back.</p>

<p>I'm really happy to have a whole new case, with two hinges that
work.  I'm mostest glad to have my data intact.</p>

<p>I do do backups nightly, but I've never restored the data; I don't
know how that process might go.</p>

<p>155,000 yen</p>

<p>Heehee;  janette's cool; she just called me back.</p>

<p>I have just filled out my holiday request form. Basically off 26
September - 9 October, but working on Saturday 27 September while
janette sleeps slash does whatever.</p>

<p>While I was at Kawasaki getting the request forms, Bill gave me the
email and phone number of a student who wants to hang out with me
(Miki).  Bill already told her that I have a girlfriend and she still
wants to hang out so I emailed her.</p>

<p>Work included now free lessons today.  Man, a busier day at KQ than
some days at Kawasaki.  Got to say HI to Chie a bit after 9pm; she was
still hanging around for a bit and I told her in Japanese something
simple, like, oh how long I've been in Japan and how much longer I'll
be there.  She wasn't too engaged with the conversation, but.  Oh
well.</p>

<p>Haven't heard from Nami in a while; I'll email her now.</p>

<p>Tried quite diligently to hack into Steve's website, but wasn't
able to.  Trying to figure out how to set up a BBST on my
site. Tantalizingly close to directories I need to see, but nope.</p>

<p>Tonight was Carla's birthday party.  Lyle bet me 300 yen I couldn't
do 60 pushups in 5 minutes.  Eric did 47.  I did 44. Benny did 60 in
less than 5 minutes.  Lyle did 60 in less time than it took Benny.</p>

<p>I enjoyed sitting next to Adriana for a bit and hearing about her
upcoming adventures in OZ and Italy translating.  I'm really excited
for her.  I wonder if I'll ever learn Japanese.</p>

<p>Gotta go to bed.</p>

<p>Work was fine.  Gazed at Miki some while teaching my last lesson.
She was in a man to man with Adriana.  haha man to man</p>

<p>Went to see fireworks with Mika and Carla after work.  I had
previously seen smiley face firworks, but I had never seen Doraimon
fireworks nor Hello Kitty fireworks.  Nor sunglasses!  Didn't get any
pics of the sunglasses, but I got some of Doraimon.</p>

<p>Went to dinner with Carla and Mika in Yokohama at some izakiah
place.  I had my favorite food, but I've again forgotten the name.
Starts with a d or g.  Carla and I committed a heinous offence against
Japanese culture by passing a cheese ball via chopsticks.  I was like,
"you wanna cheese ball?" and chopsticked it to Carla, who took it with
her chopsticks, to Mika's horror.  "NO!"</p>

<p>Carla (vegetarian) thought maybe Mika was looking out for her, "is
there meat in them?" as she tried to pass it back to me.  Mika took
Carla's hand and placed the cheese ball on Carla's plate.  Explained
that the action of passing things with chopsticks is only done when
passing bones of the desceased to their final resting point or
something ike that. Who knew?</p>

<p>Actually I had heard it before and forgot.</p>

<p>Got home and found Frank all sunburned from climbing Mt Fuji, which
was much more grueling than he expected.</p>
