<p class=date>7:59am CST Sunday 12 November 2000
<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>At a grocery store, with bunch of rally peeps, Bryn and
a couple of other youth were talking about Australia with me and
chillin&rsquo; on a bed next to the freezer aisle, watching chaos in the
freezer aisle as youth were tossing boxes everywhere and just happily
causing chaos everywhere.  I finally thought it was too much and got
up to tell them so, but the manager had already started yelling at
them.</p>

<p><p class=dream>As I walked back to where I had been, the scene shifted
to me and Katherine and Hannah doing dishes and Katherine telling me
about a guy named David who taught them a puzzle game like &ldquo;Good Frog
Bad Frog&rdquo; or &ldquo;Johnny Whoops&rdquo; or &ldquo;Celing Wall Floor.&rdquo;  I think the
answer to this game was more along the lines of Good Frog Bad Frog.</p>

<p class=date>9:17am CST Saturday 11 November 2000
<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was outside by an office building and sitting on some
benches with friends of mine when I discovered a baby (human) at my
feet.  I held it cuddifully as if it were my cat Spot.  Baby seemed
happy and I just carried it around.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I found $20 beside me, which was fortunate because I
owed a friend of mine $20.  I offered it to him and he was all, &ldquo;you
paid me back two weeks ago and you tried to pay me back last week and
I told you then you already paid me back.&rdquo;  I was embarassed and once
and for all crossed the item &ldquo;pay him back $20&rdquo; off my To Do list.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p class=dream>Somehow I was in a hospital and needed to finalize some
paperwork so I went to the records department and got everything I
needed.  There were three 8-year old triplets in front of me, who were
in line to get braces on their teeth.  I accidentally cut in front of
their mom, but when they got to the front of the line, their mom went
all the way up front to talk to the people behind the desk.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I told them I needed my outgoing paperwork and they
printed it out for me and I took it to my car.  Jason or someone was
going to ride with me- no I think it was Robin from Ohio and I told
him about Jason being a stock broker.  He thought that was cool and
helped me push Scott back from the brink of rolling down a big hill.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I noticed that I didn&rsquo;t have all the pages of my
hospital paperwork, so I went back to the office and talked to the
lady behind the desk, who had switched to a different seat behind the
counter.  On the counter was &ldquo;bible&rdquo; from a non-mainstream religion;
it included nude pictures in it to emphasize the point of what is
wrong with sinning.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I got the missing page of my paperwork and went outside
to where Evan White (PSWD?) was doing a standup comedy routine with
flaming torches.  Actually it was just one flaming torch and he played
it like a variety of musical instruments: saxophone, bagpipes,
uekelele, harp, and others.  Quite amazing skills and very
entertaining.  I was watching all this from way up on a treehouse and
at the end of his show, he climbed up the side of the treehouse and I
helped him climb in by holding the torch as he climbed over the wooden
railing thing.  I got a bit of soot on my hands, but not much.  I
wiped it onto the outside of the wooden fence thing and was careful
not to get splinters.</p>

<p><p class=dream>For a moment my vision was washed out by brightness as
other people came up the treehouse via the ladder and not the side
like Evan did and they all wondered how he climbed up there so fast.
He shrugged off their question.  My vision was restored to normal and
I soon woke up.</p>

<p class=date>4:48pm CST Saturday 11 November 2000</p>

<p><p>Wende and I just had our first movie marathon - we watched
<em>Charlie&rsquo;s Angels</em> and <em>Meet The Parents</em>.  I really
liked Charlie&rsquo;s Angels - it was just the funniest balance between
stupid-funny / sexy / action that I&rsquo;ve seen!  Plus they had almost
every cool scene that I love in <em>The Matrix</em>.  I woulda been
all, &ldquo;what a ripoff,&rdquo; but there were just too many such scenes to be a
coincidence.  Helicopter / people hanging from it / fighting scenes /
bullet time / and more, but I&rsquo;m in a hurry.</p>

<p><p>Meet the parents was not as funny, but it turned around well at the
end.</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;re leaving now to go eat dinner at Maggie and John&rsquo;s with the
whole gang!!</p>

                        <p><title>Unicycle and dinner</title>
<p class=date>8:11am CST Sunday 12 November 2000</p>

<p><p>Last night after we left in a big hurry after the movies, Wende and
I were reviewing <em>Charlie&rsquo;s Angels</em> together.  We started
singing Sir Mix-A-Lot&rsquo;s &ldquo;Baby Got Back,&rdquo; but didn&rsquo;t know more lyrics
than after &ldquo;&hellip; sprung&rdquo;  Wende suggested that maybe it was on the
soundtrack to the movie.  Ah, good call!</p>

<p><p>We had to stop by Wende&rsquo;s work, and she got stuck there for an
hour (ugh), but fortunately, I had my (borrowed) unicycle.  I rode
down to the music store and bought the soundtrack CD to the movie!  I
engaged two cashiers in conversation about movies, from Charlie&rsquo;s
Angels and Matrix to Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal.  One guy was
all, &ldquo;have you read <em>______ ______ dragon</em>&rdquo; (I don&rsquo;t remember
the name) and he clarified that <em>Hannibal</em> is the third book in
the series while the dragon book is the first in the series and
Silence of the Lambs is the second.  Wow.  I did not know that!  I
said &ldquo;bye&rdquo; that we were on a schedule and went back to find Wende.</p>

<p><p>I found that she was quite stuck at work and I realized that I
hadn&rsquo;t told the music store peeps that all the special effects in
Matrix are in Charlie&rsquo;s Angels!  So I went back and briefly mentioned
this point and <em>then</em> I saw that NIN has a new album (turns out to be
the remixes of &ldquo;fragile&rdquo; (Maggie and Molly (and gang) this is what I
want from you guys for Christmas) called &ldquo;things falling apart&rdquo;)
coming out on November 21st (according to the website <a
href="https://www.nothingrecords.com">nothingrecords.com</a>)</p>

<p><p>(how&rsquo;s that for a run-on sentence?)</p>

<p><p>I had high hopes that Wende would want to go soon so I practiced
riding unicycle in the back of the store parking lot waiting for her
to be finished.  I rode around a bit and then I practiced mounting the
unicycle without the aid of a curb.  (huh huh, you said &ldquo;mount&rdquo;) After
several tries I did it!  This means I have successfully completed the
components of Level One unicycle riding according to <a
href="https://www.unicycling.org">unicycling.org</a>:
<pre>
     Mount Unicycle unassisted
     Ride 50 meters
     Dismount gracefully with unicycle in front
</pre></p>

<p><p>I wasn&rsquo;t always able to dismount gracefully with the unicycle in
front, but I did that a few times.  So awesome!</p>

<p><p>I got hot and sweaty before Wende finished, so I went inside to
rescue her.  We left within a few minutes.</p>

<p><p>En route to Maggie and John&rsquo;s, we listened to most of the songs on
the CD, and to &ldquo;Baby Got Back&rdquo; twice.</p>

<p><p>Once we arrived, hugs to everyone and I helped in the kitchen a bit
and then went upstairs to hang with the guys playing billiards.  Have
we become <em>that</em> traditional?  John and Eric made a few trips down to
the kitchen (to help?) but none of the girls came up to play (at least
not while I was there).  Billiards was fun, and I made a few amazingly
lucky shots and a lot of crappy shots, including bouncing the cue ball
over my intended ball and off the table.</p>

<p><p>Dinner was announced and we all rumbled down to the kitchen and
dining area to feast on the most lovely incredible chicken, homemade
bread, yams, green beans and squash, yellow rice, gravy and cranberry
sauce ever in the whole planet.  Thank you for such a great meal!!</p>

<p><p>John&rsquo;s brother Kevin set up names in a top hat for us to choose for
Secret Santa gifts around the holidays.  I chose a name then
immediately chewed up the evidence until it was pulpy fiber in my
tummy.  MMM mmm good.  I suggested that we each tell the others what
we want for Christmas, but only a couple people went (Meredith and
Wende I think) before the conversation sidetracked to something so
slightly related that only our group could make the connection.  I
love our gang.</p>

<p><p>After dinner I helped rinse the dishes and then we remembered that
we forgot dessert!!  Cheesecake and chocolate mousse and vanilla ice
cream in dainty little dishes.  So yummy.  And then someone remembered
that we forgot the whipped topping!  Maggie squirted a bit into her
mouth and Meredith passed so Maggie tossed the can to me.  In Rob
fashion, I squirted more whipped topping into my mouth than could fit
and almost gagged but was able to retain my composure, including
swallowing with my mouth open, long enough for Maggie to get a
picture.  Aww yeah.  There&rsquo;s one for the scrapbook.</p>

<p><p>Molly set up the joke and I sputtered the punch line &ldquo;Kiss me,&rdquo; but
it sounded more like &ldquo;iii eeee.&rdquo;  Still very funny.  I&rsquo;m sure you had
to be there.</p>

<p><p>It was pretty much time to go by then, hugs to Eric and Meredith
and they left, then hugs to Wende and Rob and we left.  Such a great
and wonderful evening!!</p>

<p class=date>8:18am CST Friday 10 November 2000
<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>Deborah from work was flying a 727 jet and David&rsquo;s
sunglasses had fallen down toward the exterior door.  The door was on
the bottom front right of the plane (like a bus) instead of to the top
front left behind the cockpit.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Deborah said she was scared the glasses would fall off
the plane when they opened the door, so I volunteered to come get
them.  I ran up toward the front of the plane, and lowered myself
carefully down the steps to retrieve the glasses.  I put them in the
sink beside the restroom.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Karla emerged from the restroom and told me in
confidence that David had been asked to not bring sunglasses or any
extra unnecessary stuff onto the plane (for safety and weight
considerations).</p>

                        <p><title>Lahna Turner dot com</title>
<p class=date>11:16pm CST Thursday 9 November 2000</p>

<p><p>Today work was wonderfully productive.  At just the right moment
Wende arrived with lunch from James Coney Island.  Big baked potato
with crazy cheese and a vanilla shake for me.  Wende is so great!!</p>

<p><p>After work we ate wonderful garlic cheese tortellini and then Wende
put in a movie <em>The Muse</em>.  I had no idea she planned to watch
it and wasn&rsquo;t in a movie mood.  I went out to Sears to get a
replacement water filter for our refrigerator.</p>

<p><p>While driving, David John was interviewing Lahna Turner on KTRU.
She plays accoustic guitar and performs standup comedy and some
comedic type songs.  And some folk-ish jazz-ish accoustic-guitar-ish
songs.  She sang one of her parody songs &ldquo;The Baby Song&rdquo; on my way to
Sears and I thought it would be cool to meet her.</p>

<p><p>I zipped in and out of Sears (got the water filter during that
time) and headed toward KTRU.  She played a song called &ldquo;Chokin&rsquo; the
Chicken&rdquo; about a guy who was a mean chicken rancher and no one in the
station was willing to sing along!  I sang in my car and raced
(carefully) all the way to KTRU.  Into the station I burst while they
were playing a different song on CD.  I had missed the Chicken Chokin&rsquo;
Chorus.</p>

<p><p>Lahna is cool; she appears young, but mentioned she&rsquo;s been to
(through?) college, and is just dilligently working to get her songs
out on the airwaves and out in the world.  She said it&rsquo;s a slow
process; I simply encouraged her to stay with it; she&rsquo;s doing great.</p>

<p><p>I wanted to talk more with her, but there were several other people
in the station all doing radio type stuff, including asking her to
prepare for an impromptu hour long random interview / music segment on
the Spoken Word Show.</p>

<p><p>She gave me a copy of her CD and her URL.  <a
href="https://www.lahnaturner.com">www.lahnaturner.com</a>.  She said
the site is in dire need of updating - the main page advertises a CD
release party at SRO, but the party has been cancelled (or she wants
to cancel it) so don&rsquo;t go.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>I called Wende then zipped home and Wende was in a pretty grouchy
mood.  She talked a lot and it seemed to be a combination of a lot of
stuff.  Me not helping around the house, me going to meet cute girls
on the radio, Wende not having anyone to vent to, me and Wende not
having a lot of time to spend together, and just stuff like that.  I
listened with the best listening skills I have.  It&rsquo;s difficult a lot
of the time, but I think it&rsquo;s worth the effort.</p>

<p><p>We are pretty much going to sleep now, but I wanted to capture this
entry before I slept it away.</p>

<p class=date>12:10am CST Thursday 9 November 2000</p>

<p><p>Super special thanks to my dad who had Windows 95b that I could
install on Wende&rsquo;s computer.  She&rsquo;s been without computer for several
weeks while I tried to get it installed.  I got the machine home and
have not been able to get the TCP/IP stuff set up yet - I don&rsquo;t know
what kind of card is in the machine and I&rsquo;m too tired to mess with it
now so I&rsquo;m going to bed.</p>

<p><p>Wende and I just watched John Waters&rsquo; <em>Pecker</em>.  Recommended
to us as incredibly funny and hilarious, this movie was neither funny
nor hilarious.  Christina Ricci is about the only redeeming quality of
the film.  There were some funny scenes set up, but nothing amazing.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; Wende proclaimed at the end of the movie, &ldquo;was an art film.&rdquo;</p>

                        <p><title>Voting - Unicycling</title>
<p class=date>7:27am CST Tuesday 7 November 2000</p>

<p><p>Wende and I just voted.  We were the 3rd and 4th person in line,
and by the time we got into the place, there were at least 25 people
behind us.</p>

<p><p>As we were leaving, &ldquo;for you, Robbie, I voted for the Olympics.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Yay!!</p>

<p><p>After voting, I was a bit nervous about the road conditions.  Would
there be a nice enough sidewalk?  Would traffic run me over?  Turns
out the street below my wheel was just small enough that no cars used
it, and just big enough to have a nicely paved surface for all 8
blocks that I rode on it.  Wheeeee!!</p>

<p><p>A couple of times I almost fell, but was able to recover despite
the burning in my thighs.  Unicycling is strenuous!  I was even
blessed with a wide (mile) gap in traffic when I crossed a 4 lane
street.  Nice.</p>

<p><p>Summary: Once I got off the crunchy parking lot where we voted, I
unicycled 10 blocks all the way back to our gate without falling!!</p>

<p class=date>12:18am CST Monday 6 November 2000</p>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s raining like I&rsquo;ve never seen it rain before (since we&rsquo;ve lived
here).  The rain is all at 45 degree angle and blowing toward the
southeast.  Relatively very little lightning.  This surprised me most.
I haven&rsquo;t heard it thunder once during this otherwise torrential
display.</p>

<p><p>As I&rsquo;ve written, (it&rsquo;s 12:24am), the intensity of raindrops has
varied between &ldquo;drenching downpour&rdquo; to &ldquo;might as well be swimming.&rdquo;
Right now it&rsquo;s only a drenching downpour.</p>

<p><p class=date>12:27 am</p>

<p><p>Right now one might as well be swimming.</p>

<p><p>I take it back.  I have seen it rain this hard while living here.
Remember some months ago when I walked through an astonishing deluge
of rain and lightning?  The rain now is like the rain then, but this
time there has only been about 3 lightning flashes in this whole 10
minutes.</p>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s back to a downpour again.  I&rsquo;m going back to bed and shall
write more if I am again inspired.  (But isn&rsquo;t that always when I
write?)</p>

<p><p class=date>12:34 am</p>

<p><p>Just as I stood up, I found another indicator of the rain&rsquo;s
intensity.  The river of water on each side of the street covers a
third of the steet&rsquo;s width, leaving only a single lane worth of
pavement wet, and not flooded.</p>

<p><p>The drenching downpour has been downgraded to just raining.</p>
