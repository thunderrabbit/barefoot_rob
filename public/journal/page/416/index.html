                        <p class=date>11:30am PST Friday 20 December 2002</p>

<p>Just arrived at Jennifer's house, and she's not here.  She had to
zip over to the post office for a second; she left a message for me
about 11:10, 10 minutes after I said I would get there.</p>

<p>It took me longer to ride my bike here than I guessed.</p>

<p>I called her to find out that she'll be back in a few minutes.</p>

<p>I arrived just as it started raining.  San Francisco misty wussy
cold rain, not a Houston thoroughly pounding rain.</p>

<p>My bike is chained and cabled to a sign.  Bad guy would just have
to knock the sign off and lift my bike over the pole to get it off.
But the cable would still have to be cut to allow the wheels to roll.
I think I'll thread the chain through the spokes too.</p>

<p>There we go.  That's what I'm talkin' about.  Security.</p>

<p class=date>11:49am</p>

<p>Jennifer's neighbor needs to run off to pick up her grandson, and
asks if I'll stay here for PG&E (which, after working with GenXchange,
I happen to know stands for Pacific Gas & Electric) to come by.</p>

<p>I'm about to get Scott from the garage where he's been sleeping,
retrieve my skates and join the Friday Night Skate around SF.  Nice.</p>

<p class=date>11:57pm</p>

<p>Back at Wende's now.  What an incredibly excellent skate!!</p>

<p>The short version is that no one else showed up for the Friday
night skate, but I saw two trolleys driving by with Carolers singing
and wishing people happy holidays and all sorts of positive energy
flowing from them, so I followed them to Ghiradelli Square and hung
out for a bit.</p>

<p>Left Wende's with skate on feet around 7:20pm. I found the streets
quite wet, but not too slick, though some of the downhills were a bit
tricky to slow down completely before I got squished by cross
traffic.</p>

<p>I thrilled down Mission (?) toward the downtown area where Wende
works, right down the lanes with the cars, and sometimes faster than
them down the hill, especially if they were slowed down by red traffic
lights, I'd zip between the cars to the front of the line, and
sometimes skate across the red light if I could do so safely.</p>

<p>Awesome to roll along with traffic across a big intersection with
several slick and slightly bumpy trolley tracks strewn across it.
Navigating myself along within the cars, watching the street to make
sure a skate doesn't get lodged in the groove of a track (mostly
difficult in this case because I was mostly going right across them,
not along them) and watching for pedestrian traffic that might be
jaywalking (how rude!).</p>

<p>Dropped off Wende's apartment keys at her work (she has an extra
set of all but the outside door to get into the building) in case I
was still skating at 11 when she got off work.</p>

<p>Basically hauled butt down Market toward the Embarcadero, sometimes
having to stop for red lights, sometimes getting to sail across the
intersections, navigating people and sometimes jumping off the curb
into the street if the sidewalks were too crowded.  The streets were
awesome because the rougher surface allowed my skates better grip and
therefore greater acceleration and speed for me.</p>

<p>At what I presumed was the Embarcadero, where we were supposed to
meet, I found no one.  Well, no skaters.  But then again I was 15
minutes earlier than 8pm, which is when people were scheduled to begin
arriving.</p>

<p>I people watched a bit, skated around a bit (despite the no
bicycles, no skateboards, no skates sign (could this be the right
place, sporting such a sign?)) chilled out a bit.  Talked to two
people to make sure I was in the right place.</p>

<p>One person was John, a limosuine driver whose fare tonight was paid
by like 8 or 10 high school girls celebrating one of their birthdays.
The girls were all at the ice skating rink while I talked with John.
He used to ice skate, but has never inline skated.  His son can
snowboard (and does it well, according to his friends) so John may go
watch that sometime this season.</p>

<p>The girls all arrived, unfortunately all with long bread loaves
that they used like swords and littered across the pavement.  Not like
all of them, but 1.5 loaves were left on the ground.  I picked them up
and threw them away.</p>

<p>It began to rain around 8:30, so I figured that no one would come
skate with me.  I took off up Market the same sort of way as I had
come down it, but this time up the slight incline instead of down.</p>

<p>Around 8:45 it had stopped raining, and I headed back toward the
Embarcadero <em>just in case</em> someone else was there at 9.</p>

<p>Nope.</p>

<p>But!! Two trolley busses drove by, and people all over them were
all, "Merry Christmas!" and "Happy Holidays!" and singing Christmas
carols and good stuff like that.</p>

<p>I watched them go past and then realized this was my chance for
something fun to do tonight, so I caught up with them.  All the girls
in the back were all holding their hands out so I could give them
five, and then a couple people up front were so I moved to the front
of the bus to give them five as well.  While I watched their hands, I
couldn't watch the ground much; I'm so thankful that I didn't eat it
at that point, so early in our newfound game.</p>

<p>I found it relatively trivial to keep up with them, basking in the
girls flirting with me, "you're my hero!" ("aw thanks; you're my
heroes.. wait you're my cheer leaders!") and "how far are you going to
skate with us?" ("until I get bored or can't keep up") and "will you
go to Ghiradelli with us?"  ("Will you buy me chocolate?"  "Yes!"
"Whoohooo!  Chocolate!!!!") and "where are you from?" ("I'm from
Texas, Houston Texas.") and then, all in unison, "what's your name?"
and then the game ender, "how old are you?"</p>

<p>I changed my speed to visit the lead trolley, and they were all,
"do you have any requests [for Christmas Carols]?"  "Rudolph!!"  So
they sang Rudolph for me and I totally sang with them and did gestures
to represent the different parts of the song.  Totally thanked them
for blessing me with a song; it was so so great!</p>

<p>Stopped at an intersection where a bunch of open air restaurant
places teemed with people (maybe not teemed, but sported several staff
and customers) who all cheered when the trolley finished whatever song
they were on at the time.  One young boy inquired what I was doing and
I told him, "I'm skating along side of these trolleys while they sing
to me."  "Really?" he asked with large eyes.  "No actually," I looked
up at his dad, "but I like to pretend they are!"</p>

<p>Turned another corner and then headed up a pretty steep hill, two
blocks worth.  I basically kept up with the trolley on the first hill,
but was losing ground on the second hill.  Fortunately we turned and I
didn't have to haul butt up the hills.  I basked in lots of cheers and
kudos for having made it up the hill.</p>

<p>Then we turned and went 1 block and then down the same hill, one
block over.  I put on mad brakeage, and made it down the first hill
okay, but on the second one, I somehow screwed up and twisted and fell
<em>right beside the trolley</em> as it was moving.  I did a full 180
onto my butt and bounced my ass back up, simultaneously turned around
forwards again, made it the rest of the way down.</p>

<p>Some cheers, some jeers for that.  "You're still my hero!" ("thank
you!!") and "Not mine; you ate <em>shit</em> back there." ("yeah, but
did you see how quickly I bounced back up?  That's where it's at."  My
cheerleaders had boosted my ego enough to deflect the jeer a mile
away.)</p>

<p>We had arrived at Ghiradelli Square and several people said HI and
one cat came up to me, looking like Johnny the German exchange student
in OKC with dreads.  Looked also like Leif from Canada sorta.  His
name was Jake.  He asked if the Friday night skaters still skated each
Friday and I explained what I knew. ("yes, but apparently not tonight,
maybe cause of the rain")</p>

<p>A woman named Mary introduced herself as well.  Cute face and smile
with what I'll call a traditional fuzzy black Russian hat thing on.
Like a fuzzy top hat looking thing almost.</p>

<p>Ended up sitting between Jake and Mary, as our seats spilled off
the end of two small tables mushed together.  Jake and two of his
friends shared a sundae of eight scoops of ice cream, eight toppings,
and a pile of whipped cream.  Called an Earthquake.  They devoured it
in 15 minutes while Mary and I shared an excellent theological
discussion, started by me telling her I am a youth advisor, etc ("oh,
for what church?" etc)</p>

<p>I was impressed that she didn't seem to take "offense" at our lack
of a set creed, and even tried to summarize it in her own words.</p>

<p>I found it difficult to hear her in the din, but I got that she
believes ultimate sin exists with two results/causes: (wait, shit I'm
getting this wrong)  (!) God created the world with a bunch of set
laws and (@) The Fall (Adam and Eve's misadventures in Eden) keeps
people from being able to modify the laws that God has set.</p>

<p>My immediate question: "does that mean before The Fall that Adam
and Eve were able to modify the laws?" i.e. as Mary summarized, "that
they were equal with God?"  Exactly.  It was a question she hadn't yet
considered.</p>

<p>I'm glad to have given her some thought provoking questions.</p>

<p>With the Earthquake devoured, people started to leave from the
table.  Said bye to Jake (didn't get his email address), bye to Mary
(did get hers)</p>

<p>Bye to the matriarch and patriarch of the table (as introduced to
me by Mary, much to the chagrin of the mom) and thanked them for
having me join them, etc.</p>

<p>Several byes hollered a half block away once I got outside and the
original carolers saw me as they got into their van.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Now.  Where the fuck am I?</p>

<p>I finally found Ghiradelli on the map.  Fortunately I knew it was
close to the bay, so I just looked along that edge.  I had basically
gone 180 degrees around the circumfrence of the city.  I could either
retrace my trek and stay on quite small inclines, or bust up this
steeep ass hill right here and go straight back toward downtown.</p>

<p>Up the hill.</p>

<p>After a few particularly steep hills, I recognized I was at Hyde
and Lombard, right at the top of the proclaimed curviest street ever.
<em>No way am I going down that (and waste all my potential energy
after climbing this hill)...</em>, as I went past the street.</p>

<p>Then, <em>what am I saying?  this is my only chance to *skate* down
Lombard on a wet rainy night!</em> so I went back to skate down.</p>

<p>Oh shit this is steep.  And slick.  The road is paved with slick
red bricks.  Slick.</p>

<p>I can almost say I only fell once while going down the hill.  It
was more like I fell once or twice at every curve on the hill.  I was
basically sliding like Bambi on ice, on my kneepads and wristpads for
most of the time.  If I went down forward, I could see where I was
going, but my kneepads would slide down my leg, revealing skin for the
bricks to chew on.  If I slid backwards, the knees would be fine, but
I couldn't see where I was going.</p>

<p>So much fun!!!!</p>

<p>Exhilirated at the bottom.  <em>I just slid down Lombard!!!!!</em>
"Whoohooooooo!!" into the night sky.</p>

<p>Then I tried to skate <em>*up*</em> Lombard, but no.  Too slick.
Totally fruitless.  So I stepped up the steps on the left hand side of
the street going up.</p>

<p>Made it basically to Wende's apartment, kinda twisting my knees
trying to slow down enough going down the hills, then realized her
keys would be with her at her work.</p>

<p>I repeated my path to her work, and it seemed more dangerous this
time, and I can't really say why.  Was I just tired?  Same streets,
right?  Same amount of traffic, right?  hmmmm.</p>

<p>Got to her work, chilled outside a while, then she saw me and let
me in while they closed down all the registers and computers.</p>

<p>Walked (skated) Wende home and while crossing the large
city-sponsored lighted Christmas Tree, some cat was all, "you can't
skate up here (on this plaza thing)" So I was all, "I'm walking her
home.  Can I walk like this?" and made like I was walking in my skates
instead of rolling.  He allowed me to come across, just asked that I
go straight across and not fool around there.  No problem.</p>

<p>Got home and Wende made us some dinner of tomato, avacado, tortilla
chips, cheese.  So awesome!!!!  So thankful.</p>

<p>What a totally fantastic night!</p>

<p>Just so lazy and emotionally confused the past couple of days.
Wende and I watched <em>Lara Croft: Tomb Raider</em> on the first day
she had off from work (Wednesday) and then went to get some sushi from
the restaurant built into the bottom of her building.</p>

<p>I'm thankful for her paying; the prices were certainly higher than
I'm used to paying for dinner.  But I hopefully kept her entertained
by consuming more and more wasabi with every bite, until at the end my
eyes were all crying and sad.  In a funny way.</p>

<p>Did laundry after that.  Cost two dollars for each washer and $1.50
for each dryer.  Funny thing is that the back of the sushi kitchen is
20 feet down the hall from the laundry room.</p>

<p>Surprised me that there are exactly five washers and Wende filled
them all, and no one else tried to do laundry at the same time as us.
It's like, wow, do they have the perfect number of washers and dryers
for the building?  One of the dryers was apparently out of service
though; there are only four working.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Have been sorta poopypants lately, have had lots of dreams about
old school YRUUers.  Just last night Sean Murray was there again, and
something about Jason and a friend of his not from YRUU was in YRUU.
Something like that.</p>

<p>I can feel myself falling into old relationship patterns with
Wende.  She's got this cat named Tai (unlike her cats Peter and
Tinkerbell) that she's sorta but not really dating and has explicitly
told me that no kissing will happen between us (me an' Wende, not me
and Tai), and we've maintained that boundary.  I'm thankful for this;
it makes my life less confusing, if more frustrating.  I did ask her
on the first night I think, no on the second night if she would do my
back, which in our language means basically to preen me like monkeys
would, if they had tweezers to pull errant hairs and bobby pins to
extract blackheads from backs and ears.  This process is
simultaneously painful and comforting for me, especially in the ears
for that's one thing my mom used to do for me, back in the day.</p>

<p>Sally called last night, and after days of being cooped up inside
because of the rain and my addiction to internet LJs, AIM and such, I
went outside to talk with her, all loud and boistrous at times.  Far
louder than would be acceptable inside Wende's apartment at
11:30pm.</p>

<p>Sally and I yammered for an hour (and 7 minutes and 29 seconds,
according to my cellie).  Mostly she asked me about my latest
adventures and who I had gone to see (no one) and what I saw on the
way up here (lots) and how it's been chillin' with Wende (fine) and
what are my future plans (see Dude and Veronica for a couple days,
then try and get back to Dallas by 31 December), and as soon as I said
"try" to get back, my brain saw that as a word-fuck, as we would call
it in my men's group, for the phrase, "I'll try and call you.." -
that's a word fuck.  Either call me or don't call me.  But tell me
what you intend to do.  Or "let's try to do lunch sometime" .. man
just fuckin' get out the day planners and schedule a fucking lunch.
But then I basically allow myself to "try" and get back, because it's
a 37 hour trek (according to mapquest), plus I'm specifically on my
own vacation time.</p>

<p>So I left it at "I intend to get back by 31 December," which is
true, but because of the inherent challenges of driving 37 hours in a
week... shit I can make it.  Scott rocks; we will make it no problem.
Nevermind.  I'll be at that New Year's Eve Party.  You be there
too. (and you don't know who you are, for I'm not saying that to
anyone in particular)</p>

<p>I asked her about Rick and his surgery recovery, and about her
situation at work, to see if it's recovering as well.</p>

<p>Got a call from Jennifer a couple nights ago and am scheduled to
see her at 11am this morning to pick up the stuffed animal Sally left
there (she bought it at the same store/time that I bought the
mechanical Winnie the Pooh pencil for Wende) and chat or whatever.
When Sally and I were here last weekend, Jennifer said she and I
should hang out and then said something that hangs in my head like an
echo that my mind has been trying to take apart and decide what she
really meant, for she has a fiance and is going to leave today to see
him (though she certainly didn't predict that the only time I would
see her this time was on this last day that she would be here)
overseas though I'm wondering what she meant by, "I think you'll enjoy
how I treat you," or something like that for my mind went,
<em>what</em> when I heard it and played it over and over and took all
the words apart and put them back together even though it forgot which
ones they were and where they go in the sentence, as if I'm Mitch
Hedberg fixing a joke by taking all the words out and putting new ones
in.  Talk about a fucking obsession.  Blah.</p>

<p>Watched <em>Lara Croft</em> again last night, this time with the
English subtitles on to see if they match the actual spoken dialague.
They do, but infrequently words are left out of the subtitles, usually
not to the detriment of the viewer, but in one case, when Mr Pimms and
Mr Powell are leaving The Illuminati meeting after Mr Powell has just
assured the Illuminati that he's got everything handled, Mr Pimms goes
"We.. we don't have everything, do we?" or something like that, and Mr
Powell goes "No," in the movie, but not on the subtitles.  That's a
pretty significant word to leave out.  Not that it destroys the movie
without it, but certainly helps confirm the swindliness of Mr Powell
to include it.  After that, I watched the special effects, (and right
now as I'm typing I think I remember having already watched them at
Maggie and John's house back before they got divorced (I say that like
it was so long ago, which it really wasn't, though Maggie has moved
her life right along brilliantly and beautifully, blossoming herself
into a whole New Improved and Continually Improving Maggie)) which I
enjoyed pretty well, and then I watched the movie again, this time
with the Director's Commentary... and I realize why the average bear
might not have the ability to make such a movie as <em>Tomb
Raider</em> or at least has basically no idea what really goes into a
movie like that.</p>

<p>Officially I have been prim and proper on this trek to the west
side (Last night I found the picture of me sporting the Westside gang
symbol standing in front of the UCLA sign and laughed my ass off) and
since that's not quite true I'm going to hang out with Veronica (or
her friends) a bit more that I might have otherwise, hoping to get
this all resolved and ready to swim again.  The news has been somewhat
disruptive yet releasing as the truth shall set one free.  Buddha can
watch with detached amusement all our follies as we seek that ultimate
connection with God that seems so elusive.</p>

<p>Speaking of God, I enjoyed Ryan's idea of a book called WHY
CHRISTIANITY IS WRONG which he disclosed in discussion subsequent to
his posting an email he wrote to his mom after she sent him some
overtly Christian video message thing. I don't have the URL handy, but
look for mynameisryan from a couple days ago on livejournal.</p>

<p>Speaking of Ryan, I really hope he makes wads of cash with his
cartoon Boy In The Machine <a
href="https://boyinthemachine.tripod.com/">boyinthemachine.tripod.com</a>
I think.</p>

<p>At 7am Wende was all, "Bun, are you awake?"</p>

<p>I hadn't been, but I wake up quickly usually. "Yeah."</p>

<p>"We have to go move your car."</p>

<p>She had been up until 4am talking to Ty.  Got up and loaded two
boxes in the car that she wants to take to Good Will.</p>

<p>I was impressed at not killing the engine going from 0 to up this
steep-ass hill.  Curbing the wheels helped by keeping Scott in place
while I found the right combination of gas and clutch.  Awesome!</p>

<p>Missed the second turn due to traffic, but made a few illegal turns
after that to get around the block and back to the parking garage.</p>

<p>"I don't think I'll get a standard if I live in San Francisco."</p>

<p>It's like a valet garage cause there are elevators for the cars and
such.  The guy was all, "Woah" when he saw Scott was a standard.</p>

<p>Back to sleeep.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>Wende and one of her girl friends and I and two youth
were at SWUUSI.  We had our own cabin, away from all of the other
youth at SWUUSI.  I hadn't been to the past couple of events, so I was
unsure of everyone's name and kinda embarassed about that.  Unsure of
myself to go meet everyone cause I didn't know who I was supposed to
know and who I didn't.</p>

<p class=dream>I saw a square DVD on the coffee table so I tossed that
into the DVD player (looked like an old MAC Classic) and began to play
the video of some beach thing that had been held in Houston.</p>

<p class=dream>The light from the windows behind the TV were making it
really hard to see the TV so I used the remote control to close the
blinds on the windows.  Still too bright.  I closed the blinds the
other direction to see if that would effectively shift the light's
intrusion to the other end of the blinds.  No.</p>

<p class=dream>I started the movie and it was all touting the benefits
of sending your youth to YRUU; that YRUU benefits all who attend.</p>

<p>I woke up and realized that the light from the real sun was shining
in my eyes during my sleep.</p>

<p>I don't know where I am, but I've had a lot of fun.  Small river
pouring into the ocean, as the ocean crashes into rocks and river.</p>

<p>After taking several pictures, I carefully stepped from rock to
rock until I was basically in the middle of the river on top of a tall
rock farthest out into the ocean but still not getting flooded by the
ocean waves.</p>

<p>Muwhahahahahaaaa!!!  I'm untouchable as the mighty ocean tried to
wave up the river and get me wet.  Each time, the river water pushed
the waves back before they got me too wet.  A couple of waves out of
like 10 attempts got my shoes barely wet.  My rock is invincible!!</p>

<p>Almost.</p>

<p>Just as I felt it was time to go, I turned around to head back
toward shore.  Looked behind me at the ocean just as it had gathered
enough momentum to bowl me off the rock with about a foot of water
gushing over top of it.  Maybe 6 inches of water splashing a foot high
above the rock.</p>

<p><em>Whoooo that water is cold</em> and <em>what an adventure!</em>
as I splooshed down into the river up to my waist.  Climbed out.
Camera was wet, but okay.  (I love my camera.)  Wallet wasn't even
wet.  (how'd that happen?)</p>

<p>Standing still on the rocks on shore, I wasn't cold.  My wet
sweatpants hung around my legs without touching them.  The wind didn't
touch me so I was fine.</p>

<p>When I moved, though, the cold water touched my legs.  But it
really wasn't *that* cold, so I stripped off the sweat pants (had on
shorts underneath) and twisted the water out of the legs and spread
them out on a rock to dry.</p>

<p>Took my shoes off by the sweat pants to keep them company.</p>

<p>Big smooth rocks covered the shore.  I lept from rock to rock
keeping perfect balance and having a blast.  So beautiful.</p>

<p>I ran out of large rocks and found a beach of little black pebbles
the perfect size: small enough to run across without feeling a thing,
but big enough to be easily scooped and thrown with glee in the air or
whatever.</p>

<p>Due to the ease of pebble movement, I couldn't dig a hole big
enough that the ocean couldn't completely obliterate in 3 good waves.
Quite different than Galveston.</p>

<p>I lay down near the top of the beach on the pebble-sand to dry off
and nap a bit, but I didn't sleep.  Too excited about the beauty of
this place!</p>

<p>On the way out, I saw the sign:</p>

<pre>
  LOS PADRES 
NATIONAL FOREST 
 PICNIC GROUND

 WILLOW CREEK
</pre>

<p>So that's where I was.</p>

<p>I had a million dreams last night, some of which featured Jason
Fricke, Maia Cudhea, Sean Murray, Erick Morrow, Bryan Beck.  Fun to
get back to old school YRUU.</p>

<p class=dream>I was in an auto parts store and Jason called me from
the beach somewhere on the auto parts store phone.  He tried to
pretend he was someone else, "hey my car is broken down because of
parts you sold me."</p>

<p class=dream>I could tell it was him.  "Yeah, well, y'all just get
your car workin' again, drive it on down here and we'll take a
look."</p>

<p class=dream>"You drive your store up here and bring me the right
parts."</p>

<p class=dream>"We're sending a helicopter now to come take a look.
Just sit tight."</p>

<p class=dream>"No, I dont want a helicopter. Send a train or a
tricked out school bus with 50 inch speakers kicking Frank Black and
Madonna duet of Marilyn Mason and 2 Pac songs."</p>

<p class=dream>"Okay; it's on its way."</p>

Going back to check out the area I saw last night.</p>

<p class=date>7:20am</p>

<p>Definitely higher tide than last night.</p>

<p>I took a couple pics and two .MOVies of the waves.  Maybe they'll
come out enough to slightly get across how incredible are these waves.</p>

<p>Leaving El Capitan now.  2761 miles driven since Dallas.  151262

<p class=note>(written after 12:30am 18 Dec)</p>

<p>Around 6pm I arrived in San Francisco area.  I had called Jennifer,
Sally's friend and left a message on her machine.  She called me back
with perfect timing, as I was just turning from the 101 to the 280,
and needed further directions to her house.</p>

<p>But instead of giving me directions, she told me she would be
available after 11pm.  Okay.  But actually too bad because that's when
Wende got off work.</p>

<p>So I got off the highway, consulted a map, determined basically
which way to go to find Wende's work.  Didn't know what I'd do once I
got there.</p>

<p>I gave up on traffic and turned down a side street, hoping to find
a parking space.  Wende called me.</p>

<p>"HI"</p>

<p>"HI.  Where are you?"</p>

<p>"Near your work."</p>

<p>"Like where?  What do you see?"</p>

<p>"Um, Nia's Bar and Grill?"</p>

<p>"Wait!"  I heard her voice in stereo.  In the phone and through my
open window.</p>

<p>"Wait!  I hear you!  Where are you?  Get in!"</p>

<p>And she hung up and bang there was Wende and she climbed into
Scott, legs all bunched up on top of the food box Janette gave me for
my first trip.</p>

<p>Wow!</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>She directed me to park in a garage (one less expensive than $1.25
per each 15 minutes) and then we went for food (Her lunch and my
dinner.)  in a total mall thing all futuristic and such, including a
radio station booth set up and broadcasting from within the public
area of the mall with attractive women in santa hats attracting
attention.</p>

<p>"Do you think if I flirt with those girls I can get on the radio?"</p>

<p>"Maybe, but you'll have to be done with me first."</p>

<p>I kept that challenge in the back of my head, but never tried to
get on the air.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>We ate at some place; I took Wende back to her work and plugged in
my computer to charge the battery in their break room.</p>

<p>Met Lori and Lisa at her work.  Lori told me a bit about her road
trip.  Lisa offered to loan me her museum membership so I can get in
free!</p>

<p>Lots of grape vineyards on either side of the 101 now.  Smooth
immaculate green grassy hills otherwise.  Overcast with occassional
drizzles.</p>

<p>Previously I gawked at large oak trees dripping with moss coating a
hill in mottled grays and greens.  A rainbow began to arc from behind
them, not quite finding enough moisture to climb over the hill.
Cattle on terraced slopes eating lazily.</p>

<p>40 miles to San Luis Obispo, which is where the 101 and the 1
separate for a while.  I'll take the 1 along the coast.  Somewhere
along there is Piedras Blancas, which apparently features elephant
seals fighting to mate.</p>

<p class=date>9:11am</p>

<p>On the 1 just north of San Luis Obispo, and saw a sign for
California Mens Colony.  I wonder what that is?  Anything like my
men's group?</p>
