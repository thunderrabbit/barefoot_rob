<p>Bang I'm awake.</p>

<p>I went pee, went back to bed, no sleepy sleep, so fine I'll get up
  and study.</p>

<p>I was lying in bed thinking about Nova (not surprising) and the new
  level up criteria.  I'm not sure why Nova is reducing the
  requirements for the different levels, but I've heard "there weren't
  enough level ups," which is just about the <em>worst</em> reason I
  can imagine for such a change.</p>

<p>At the same time, the change makes me interested in staying with
  Nova a bit longer just to see what life is like on the other side
  of that fence.  And a student said she liked my lessons best (and
  the lesson in question was one of my go in there and wing it cause
  I have no idea what I'm doing lessons).  Is working at Nova all
  that bad?  Yeah, I still hate it.  But why? why do I hate it? Cause
  I feel inept in the lessons and students .......  I had a good
  lesson last night - it was one that I thought went over pretty
  well.  I had drawn a map and had students give directions to
  various locations on the map.  I did not once open the book.  They
  were Level 6, and one of the lessons in the book is an Everyday
  Conversation (by far the least popular lessons in the book, with
  quality conversations such as</p>

<pre>
            Would you like a cigarette?
            No thanks, I'm trying to quit.
            Oh, come on, have one.
            No really, I have a terrible cough and sore throat.
</pre>

<p>which is a good example of why I think the book bites) for giving
  directions.  (( d'oh; it's raining.  cold and rainy = ewww ))
  Anyway I just thought the lesson went quite well.</p>

<p>A previous lesson was with four level 4 students, including
  disruptive pen-slamming Makoto, huge vocabulary Terumi, flight
  attendant Ritsuko (?), and one other student.  Ritsuko and the one
  other are quite capable, but wouldn't say anything during the
  warm-up ("what are alternatives to cars?" which I was just
  embarassed to ask because I couldn't think of any other way to get
  them to use the language "instead of" besides saying, "class, I want
  you to make sentences using 'instead of'," which I've tried before
  and it rarely works) even after Makoto and Terumi started talking
  and so I gave Ritsuko and the other a much broader question, "why do
  people use cars?" and this got them talking.</p>

<p>So I had four students and two different conversations going on
  (not unusual), and it was a bit of a trick for me to keep track of
  both of them.  Realistically I didn't; Makoto rarely takes the
  lessons seriously; I just heard Terumi saying "why do you think
  so?" over and over... what chaos.  But I left the lesson feeling
  like I had actually helped.</p>

<p>I had a lesson with I forget-her-name Level 2 student.  I had read
  in the comments that she's a solid level 2 (Scott said that) so I
  was like, fuck the book, and I went in there "HI I'm Rob.  I'd like
  you to drive this lesson."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"First, you decide
  if you want to use the book or not."</p>

<p>"Either way is okay."</p>

<p>"Please choose."</p>

<p>"No book."</p>

<p>"Okay," and we just talked, which was great for me; I was able to
  give her maximum talk time and help correct her errors and see her
  using the corrections correctly.  It felt like a good lesson to
  me.</p>

<p>So that's three lessons that seemed to go well yesterday.  Even
  though one started out like crap.  Do I think I'm a good group
  teacher?  No, but I'm getting better.  Do I know all the students'
  names?  No, but I'm learning more.  For a brief instant yesterday,
  I thought <em>I could settle in to this</em> or something like
  that.</p>

<p>brain is gone; maybe I'll sleep. 5:41am</p>

<p>I bought a coat today. Black with soft fuzzy interior and
  soft-leather-ish fabric outside (not leather though).  With a
  hood.</p>

<p>Morag is a great liar or she really likes the coat.</p>

<p>My backpack fell from a hook a little while ago.  No problem of
  course for the backpack, but I felt a bit concerned about my
  computer in the backpack.  My computer, apparently, is tough enough
  to handle such a shock.  Sweet.</p>

<p>Tonight Morag and I went to Starbucks to study.  We really really
  had fun!!  We've scheduled to do it again next Friday.</p>

<p>I wrote:</p>

<p>I see that the last three characters should actually be four
  characters: を買った。 But it's a pretty good set of sentences for
  me.  I'm going to email it to あやな for correction.</p>

<p>Had my Aries twin in a lesson today.  She's my twin only in sign;
  she's in HS I think and she drinks.  She did pretty well in the
  lesson.  We didn't totally bond cause there was another student this
  time.</p>

<p>Then I had a 7C cat who was totally hard core.  He knows more noun
  vocab in English than I do in Japanese and he could correctly
  distinguish and use "am" vs "do" two words which often vex Japanese
  learning English.</p>

<p>Just had Sachiko level 5, who has been here for about 10
  lessons.   She asked about "a" vs "the" and I gave her some
  examples and then she was like, "okay; I'm sorry to have
  interrupted the lesson."</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> have no lesson."</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Really.  Nova Usagi thinks I'm the worst Nova teacher ever."</p>

<p>"No..."</p>

<p>"Yeah.  <em>But</em>, I was going to look at #66.  It's past
  passives like, "Koizumi was seen at George Bush's ranch."  Past
  because it's in the past and passive "</p>

<p>"And passive because someone else looked at him."</p>

<p>"Exactly.  So do you want to do this or more A and The?"</p>

<p>"Articles."</p>

<p>"Excellent."</p>

<p>And that's what we did.</p>

<p>She's going to her friend's wedding tomorrow and wants to wear a
  Korean somethin' and her husband wants her to wear a kimono.  But
  she can't put on a kimono by herself (すみか agrees that it's not
  easy) and her husband doesn't know how to help her put it on
  either.</p>

<p>I was like, "you should tell him if he can help you put it on, you
  will wear it."</p>

<p>"You will make a good husband some day."</p>

<p><em>wow</em>, "thank you."</p>

<p>New roommate moved in today.  Kinda short notice, but he's been in
  Nova for about a month and had a 70 minute train ride to work each
  way and wanted to move closer.  He's unhappy with his new room cause
  there's mildew in it and he might move again.  I trust all will work
  out for what's best.</p>

<p>Funny quote at work today.  Um, dammit; I threw away my paper um...</p>

<p>No, that's not the quote; I really threw away the paper.</p>

<p>But something I do remember from work: oh, two things:</p>

<p>1) On the way leaving my apartment, I put my shoes on (like normal)
  but when I got to work I realized I had on my casual shoes and not
  my work shoes.  Good news is that <em>all the ATs</em> were at a
  meeting so I got away with no one calling me on them.
  Muwahahaha.</p>

<p>2) On the way leaving work, なお and あすこ were like, "yo Rob, one
  of the students says she likes your lessons best."  And I was like,
  "wha?" and wondered if they meant she liked Kawasak and they were
  like, "no, your lesson... and she's level three!" and I was like,
  "wow." cause yeah, well, wow and pretty much really happy to hear
  that so I went back and found the student's file to see if I could
  remember who she is, but I can't.  I remember the lesson kinda, but
  not what she looks like.  Student's name is なおこ。</p>

<p class=date>11:12pm</p>

<p>Only 32 more lessons until my weekend.  Oh, and tomorrow I get to
  hang with Morag at KQ!  EEeeee!</p>

<p>I learned that the IRS is overbudget and well delayed in upgrading
  their computer system, but they'll be screwed soonishly as the old
  cats who know the old system are going to retire soon.</p>

<p>I looked through some of the mysterious files in my file system to
  see what I can see.  I renamed the OS 9 folder to see if I really
  need it.  That's probably dangerous, but oh well.</p>

<p>aight bedtime!</p>

<p>Went to half price okonomiyaki with Miki tonight.  Fun stuff.  It
  was really cold outside afterward watching the fountains at
  Cinecitta.</p>

<p>I fell asleep and missed Musashi Kosugi by two stations.  Woke up
  one station past as the doors were closing.  Made it back in time
  for the last train.</p>

<p>It's getting to be fucking freezing here in Tokyo.  Boooooo.</p>

<p>I'm not sure that I could study slower than I am today (since 6am)
  and actually still call it studying.</p>

<p>I have smurfed a list of kanji from <a
  href="https://www.dartmouth.edu/~kanji/">Dartmouth.edu's kanji
  website</a> and used it to learn stroke order of some kanji verbs.
  So far, two: 食べる and 見る。 I have, in addition to learning the
  stroke order, written four short sentences with each of these kanji,
  using the short (informal) conjugations for did/didn't/do/don't
  meanings.</p>

<p>I'm not sure that my sentences are semantically correct; I just
  want them to be grammatically correct.</p>

<p class=date>11:29am</p>

<p>Zoooming now; I've just done four sentences for 飲みる。</p>

<p>I definitely made Japanese study progress today.  Nice.</p>
