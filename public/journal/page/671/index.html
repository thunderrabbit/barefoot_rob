<p class=date>18 March 1998</p>
<p>
This night the LRY met at Macaroni Grill for dinner.  Adam <!Wood>, kT <!Hammons>, Laura <!McCuen>, Wende <!Whitlock> and I were all there.   Actually, Wende got there a little late since she had been stuck at work.
<p>
The most fun thing about Macaroni Grill is they cover the tables with white paper and give crayons so patrons can express their artistic talents. kT and I expressed our talents maliciously at each other, resulting in an illegible scrawl of color in our corner.<br>
Of course, it was all in fun... ;)
<p>
As the waiter shredded parmesan cheese over my noodles, I tossed the few shreds that landed on the table onto kT's shirt. The funniest thing is she didn't notice until she went to the restroom!  Ha!
<p>
Then when I got back from the car, there was pepper or something gritty all over my chair. Heh.  I didn't notice it 'til I sat down cause the chair was black.
<p>
I tipped the waitress with 4 dollars including a two dollar bill.
<p>
After the evening, I took our art and pinned it up in the LRY room at church.</p>

<p>
Well, today I talked with Wende. I did not want her to move out, but simply wanted my emotional space to myself. I have asked her to be roommates with me. She had indicated that she cannot afford to live alone, especially as she is trying to save dollars for graduate school. So we will be roommates and she'll live in the living room as other roommates of mine have. I thankfully expect the everything to work out well. We looked at miniblinds for her today.
<p>
<b>Why</b> do I have my personal life on the Web?<br>
I don't know.
<p>
Then we saw <em>The Big Lebowski</em>, starring Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, and some other people. It wasn't as hilarious as <em>The Wedding Singer</em>, and it wasn't as confusing as a first viewing of <em>Pulp Fiction</em>, but it was kinda funny and kinda bizarre. I felt sorry for Dude, played by Jeff Bridges, but everything seemed to pretty much work out in the end.  </p>

                        <p><p>These were taken while I was at Astroworld during Season Pass Sneak Preview day on 13 March 1998</p>

<p><p>There are 9 pictures about 74k each, so chill for a second.
<br>If they don&rsquo;t come up, you can click on an image to view it.
<br>These images are all available
<a href="/images/coasters/houston/ttt/">here</a></p>

<p><p><a href="/images/coasters/houston/ttt/ttt_twilight.gif"> <img
src="/images/coasters/houston/ttt/ttt_twilight.gif" alt="first two
loops"></a> This shows the first two loops of Taz&rsquo;s Texas Tornado. The
white one is first, and then the black one immediately after.  When
you ride, be sure to sit up straight through these loops, as the
shoulder harnesses ratchet down pretty tightly.<br> I estimate these
two loops (plus their entry and exit) give 800 degrees of loop.  The
train completes both loops within 15 seconds after it completes the
initial ascent.  They are so fast and smooth that I could not tell
where I was when I rode with my eyes closed.</p>

<p><p><hr width="50%"></p>

<p><p><a href="/images/coasters/houston/ttt/ttt_loops.gif"><img
src="/images/coasters/houston/ttt/ttt_loops.gif" alt="last two
loops"></a> On the left of this image are the other two loops on the
ride.  They are much more evenly spaced, like at 30 and 45 seconds of
the full 60 second ride time (not including ascent).<br> The second of
these loops (smaller and further away) is pretty much a corkscrew and
jerks toward the left as it exits.</p>

<p><p><hr width="50%"></p>

<p><p><a href="/images/coasters/houston/ttt/clyde_before.gif"><img
src="/images/coasters/houston/ttt/clyde_before.gif" alt="before"></a>
Clyde Drexler and friends before riding.  Before she got on, the woman
was asked (off camera by someone in line) &ldquo;who are those kids?&rdquo;  She
said, &ldquo;um, well, I think&hellip; um.. I have no idea.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p><hr width="50%"></p>

<p><p><a href="/images/coasters/houston/ttt/clyde_after.gif"><img
src="/images/coasters/houston/ttt/clyde_after.gif" alt="after"></a>
Clyde and them after riding.  After the obvious questions, Clyde said,
&ldquo;it was good,&rdquo; and &ldquo;no, I think once is enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p><hr width="50%"></p>

<p><p><a href="/images/coasters/houston/ttt/on_ttt_2.gif"><img
src="/images/coasters/houston/ttt/on_ttt_2.gif" alt="before first
drop"></a> This is near the very beginning of the ride, between the
lift and the first drop, which is visible just to the right of the
right hand rail.</p>

<p><p><hr width="50%"></p>

<p><p><a href="/images/coasters/houston/ttt/on_ttt_1.gif"><img
src="/images/coasters/houston/ttt/on_ttt_1.gif" alt="?"></a> I have no
idea where on the ride this is.</p>

<p><p><a href="/images/coasters/houston/ttt/ttt_station.gif"><img
src="/images/coasters/houston/ttt/ttt_station.gif" alt="upside down
wack-out shot"></a> I think this is taken from within one of the first
two loops. The &ldquo;top&rdquo; of the picture is toward the right. That white
rectangle is the roof of the station.</p>

<p><p><hr width="50%"></p>

<p><p><a href="/images/coasters/houston/ttt/ttt_uvj.gif"><img
src="/images/coasters/houston/ttt/ttt_uvj.gif" alt="universal

that drove the booster wheels to pull the train to the top of the
first drop.</p>

<p><p><hr width="50%"></p>

<p><p><a href="/images/coasters/houston/ttt/ttt_viper.gif"><img
src="/images/coasters/houston/ttt/ttt_viper.gif" alt="Tornado and
Viper"></a> This is the Tornado next to the initial drop of The Viper
(with a tunnel around it).  I loved Viper when it first came out, and
I still do.  But Tornado is like Viper times 4.<br> The rides are
literally right next to each other.</p>

<p><p>
I went to Astroworld today for the Season Pass Sneak Preview and rode Taz&rsquo;s Texas Tornado 21 times.  Twenty-one.  I rode the very first time it ran that night because I was the very first one in the park and first in line with Jennifer and Karen, who I met while we waited for the park to open.
<p>
I rode it essentially 9 times in a row (had to get out, go around and get back in line each time) and then the line was longer than waiting for 1 train cycle so I got my season pass processed.
<p>
During those 9 times, I was next in line for the ride when none other than Clyde Drexler (*) got to <em>glide</em> in front of everyone and do a photo shoot with two kids in the front seat. After the pictures, he squeezed his tall self into the seat and rode 1 time.
<p>
I took pictures from my side view of him and all that.  Then I got to ride in the seat that he rode in.  I&rsquo;m not a huge fan, but there was some implicit prestige with that spot.
<p>
I took pictures from on the ride and got in trouble with Kevin and I&rsquo;m sorry about that but I&rsquo;m glad I got the pictures. Maybe (just maybe) I&rsquo;ll get some scanned and put them on here.<br></p>

<p><p>
So I went and got my season pass processed and came back but the ride was temporarily closed during rain so Jennifer, Karen and I chilled and rode the Mayan Mindbender 3 times consecutively (did not have to get out).  I took a picture while inside that ride (I&rsquo;m a slow learner); I hope it comes out!  (It&rsquo;s an indoor ride and I used a flash).
<p>
Then we rode Dungeon Drop once and wanted to ride Excalibur, but <em>no one</em> was there to ride it and the operators said we had to get 25 people before we could ride!!  How ironic that there were too few people in the park!!!
<p>
Back to the Tornado where we rode 4 times consecutively without changing seats and then Jennifer and Karen left and I switched seats between each ride (did not have to leave the station) for a total of 21 rides.  The last ride was full of park employees and I was in the front left seat, exactly where I started that night. It was the last time the train ran that night!  Awesome.</p>

<p><p>
(*) Clyde &ldquo;the Glide&rdquo; Drexler is a professional basketball player for the Houston Rockets.<br>
He has just signed on to be the head coach for the University of Houston Cougars.</p>

<p class=date>12:30am Friday 13 March 1998</p>
<p>

Some years ago I heard the President's <em>State of the Union</em> address and I thought it would be cool if I wrote <em>State of My Life</em> addresses in my diary.  
<p>
They go something like this:
<p>
Friday 13 March 1998<br>
<b>STATE OF MY LIFE</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>
I am flat tired of living with Wende but I'm too fucking scared to tell her because I don't want to break her heart.<br>
(This is probably the 1 thing I needed to get off my chest; how ironic that I can tell the whole world but not Wende. I'm not really telling the world, though; almost no one visits my page anymore.  Well, except for you, and I appreciate it.)
</li>
<li>
I have been King of my I-Group for the past 4 weeks.  This coming Monday we will be meeting at Dave and Buster's instead of at our normal place.
</li>
<li>
I learned that Manda, one of my ex-girlfriends, and actually the one ex-girlfriend I think about most, was in a major accident, but walked away physically unscathed.  I haven't actually talked to her about it, but heard about it from her mom.
</li>
<li>
The disk drive on my computer goes into sleep mode every minute or so, even if I'm working on it and typing and stuff. If I'm in a bad mood, it further pisses me off to have to wait for it to cycle back on.  See? it just did it again.
</li>
<li>
I have just gotten back into gymnastics class; I think I wrote that in a previous entry.  The first night I started, I was able to do round-off back flips.  Big tall ones.<br>
The next week, I was able to do round-off back flips and punch fronts (front flips).<br>
The next week, I worked on the runway trampoline on back handsprings and was able to do them pretty well, and I even did some back handspring back flips.  Cool.<br>
Currently the gym is closed for 2 weeks so they can move to a bigger facility next door.
</li>
<li>
My stretch in I-group was to spend some money on myself. That week, I purchased an Astroworld Season Pass, and I am way excited about it.<br>
The coolest thing is they just built a new coaster that has 4 loops!!!  I am so excited that I might go on opening day, which is tomorrow!
</li>
<li>
I need to get some new glasses.
</li>
<li>
I would like to spend more time on myself... more time writing on my webpage, more time meditating.. but for some reason I just haven't been doing that.  I cite Wende living with me as the reason I don't, but I'm not sure that's a good reason.  I don't know what the deal is.
</li>
<li>
At work, I just finished the latest version of invoice_lookup_server, and I am really proud of it. The main addition I made allows it to read information from an RDB (Relational Database) using SQL (Structured Query Language).  I have designed it so any query can be made on any database, and the format of the output is pretty darn flexible. New queries may be added, and existing queries may be changed without a coding change.  All of the queries and formatting are defined in text files and can be changed no problem.
</li>
<li>
At work, I am supposed to begin working with Allen on a project, but I'm not looking forward to it because Allen is a dork and the project requires changing some old old old crappy crappy crappy code.  It's a monster program written in PL/1 and I'm not happy about working on it.
</li>
<li>
It's 2:34am.<br>
I wrote the above 10 entries and just now spent almost 1 hour separating my 1997 and 1998 journal entries into two directories. I feel good to have gotten that cleaned up.<br>
My next goal will be to rename the 1997 entries.  Realistically, I may never do that.
</li>

<hr>

<p><pre></p>

<p>Well we left OKC Friday night at about 6:00 which put us in austin
around 2 in the am. Even though it was a real long drive and Adam kept
flicking me in the back of the head on the way there and Susanne kept
sticking her toes in my ear, it was all worth it to see everybody that I
hadn&rsquo;t seen since Dallas. We got there just in time for opening circle
so sat in the circle while Blake told us all the rules and stuff. After
she was done everyone scattered like a pack of frightened chinchillas to
hang out with there rally buddies. So then this cop walks in and starts
grabbing kids and we&rsquo;re all goin&rsquo; &ldquo;hey what&rsquo;s going on here&rdquo;? Well it
turns out that a few people were doin&rsquo; &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; that&rsquo;s listed as &ldquo;bad&rdquo; in
the big four. So guess who got sent to the safe house? That&rsquo;s right,
those kids who were bein&rsquo; naughty. Which just goes to show ya that it
doesn&rsquo;t pay to violate the big four. Well after awhile everybody started
to calm down and everything went back to normal. Aaron and Kris started
doing there usual routine of playing guitar and singing. Tiffany and
susanne ran away and hid like usaual to practice something for the
talent show that they&rsquo;ll end up being to embaressed or shy to play and
Maia just walked around being socialy smooth. Then after
awhile&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.. &hellip;OH WAIT!!! I wasn&rsquo;t at the Austin
Rally. Whoops I forgot!!! Beleive it or not there is a message in all of
this. Basically, I rember being excited once I got home from a rally so
I could get on the internet and read the rally reviews and look at
pictures from the rally. But Nobody&rsquo;s  written anything since OKC 98&rsquo;and
there haven&rsquo;t been any pictures sent in since SWUUSI 97&rsquo;. Bassically
what I&rsquo;m trying to say is that it&rsquo;s not that hard to write a rally
review( I just wrote a partial on for Austin asnd I wasn&rsquo;t even there).
So if somebody will please write Reviews for New Orleans, SWUUSI and
Austin I promise I&rsquo;ll write a real long one for Tulsa. And if anybody
has pictures from any rallies within the past year scan them onto a disk
and send them to <a href=mailto:swdyruu@cheerful.com>swdyruu@cheerful.com</a>. PLEASE!!!!!!! Thanks and I
love you all.</p>

<p class=date>19 Feb</p>

<p>On Tuesday, I went to gymnastics class for the first time in probably
3.5 to 4 years ??!!!!
<p>
Wow how wonderful it was to be back on that big bouncy blue carpet!<br />
<p>
We started with some walking handstands and then cartwheels then
roundoffs then after a bit I was doing roundoff back flips!! Big big
tall high back flips and I felt glorious and joyful!
After the hour of class, I went to the runway trampoline and did some
front flips and even was able to get a proper front layout flip once.
Way way way fun.
I got on the high bar, but after only a few swings, I could feel my palm
screaming &ldquo;RIP!&rdquo;
I didn&rsquo;t rip, but dropped off and wondered how I was able to do it
previously..  I think I need to loosen my grip some.
<p>
I met Nelson, Eric, Lyle, Catherine, Jennifer, Tasha, Kenneth, and BB.</p></p>

<p class=date>6-8 February 1998</p>
<p>

Dallas Rally was last weekend!
<p>
Once we got a bit more than halfway to Dallas, kT and I thoroughly
confounded Laura and Adam with a nice long game of Ceiling Wall Floor.
<p>
I was pleased that I didn't have to consult the map to get to the
church.  I've been to Dallas Rally a few times!
<p>
We got there with bouncy happy anticipation, signed in, dumped our
stuff, got mugbook pictures taken (I wore my rainbow striped stocking
cap over my face for the picture), and I walked around saying HI to
everyone.
<p>
I missed the first part of opening circle; I don't remember why.
<p>
After opening circle, the activity level was kinda chill.  By 3am many
people were all crashed out sleeping around the sanctuary.  I wandered
from group to group until like 4am and slept till 7.
<p>
The funniest thing about the Games Workshop Saturday AM was that Bryan
Beck didn't know it was an actual workshop. He had joined us in order
to not attend a workshop!  Once he found out, he almost left, but we
convinced him to stay.  We played Ceiling Wall Floor, Telephone, and
the 7 game.
<p>
Lunch was yummy sandwiches, and I got to be nearly first in line so
people on SWUUSI staff could go to the SWUUSI staff meeting.  I ended
up not going to the meeting, but the sandwich was great!
<p>
I attended Will B's acting workshop in afternoon.  He taught us part
of how to really "get into character."  We chose individual monologues
and read them aloud.  Then we decided what was the character's
favorite color, day of the week, type of music, car, house, etcetera,
and reread them.  Amazing how much more real that made the reading!
<p>
Soon after that, several of us played Ultimate in the YMCA field.  I
had great fun, and I hope everyone else did too.
<p>
After almost half an hour of Ultimate, the YAC members had to leave to
attend the YAC meeting, which was actually quite productive, despite
Bryan B's crazy sleep-deprived antics and the general non-focused
short attention spans we all seemed to have.
<p>
I bounced around the various groups in Channing Hall and the
sanctuary, making sure all my youth were still happy and healthy.
They were, and the energy level of the rally was kinda slowing down,
so I took a nap for about an hour until time for worship.
<p>
I woke up and soon my brother arrived!  I knew he was planning to
come, but it was super cool to see him.  We hadn't been to a rally
together since Dallas Rally 1990..
I introduced Fred (my bro) around to lots of people, and surprise
surprise, he worked on remembering everyone's names.
After a while, I quit introducing him as my brother, because of what
we planned for the talent show.
<p>
The funniest thing: Fred and I were looking for someone to beatbox as
part of our talent show.  Curtis M would drop some beats as an example
to whoever we asked if they could beatbox.  (I'm laffin' as I type
this, but I can tell it's not as funny in text.)<br>
We'd be all, "Hey, Ryan, can you beatbox?"  <br>
And Ryan (or whoever we asked) would be all, "like what?"  <br>
"Curtis, show 'em."  And Curtis would bust out some trippin' beat for
about 2 seconds and we'd go, "do that."<br>
They'd be "what???  I can't do that!"<br>
We couldn't do it either; don't worry.
<p>
Worship was another Nathan Ryan Original, and quite pleasing to my
spirit.  Ya had to be there!
<p>
After worship we meandered and then congregated in Channing Hall for
the talent show.

<p>After several great acts, Fred and I did ours: Things to Prove We
are Brothers.  Jeremy had a list of items that he could read and Fred
and I would each have the same response.  They were funny (or not)
because the reactions were so out of context and some were just
bizarre.  The final one Jeremy read was "Alright" to which Fred and I
rapped our beloved <a
href=/writing/old/misc/alphabet_game.html>alphabet game</a> twice,
with Curtis et. al. doing beatbox as backup.</p>

<p>
As we finished, Tiffany S and Suzanne K and Maybe Maia C were all,
"wait!  We want to see the feet!"
They wanted Fred to take off his shoes to see if he had hobbit feet like
me.  After a bit of balking, Fred took off his shoes and bang sure
enough he has hair on his feet too!
<p>
Adam L then was all, "wait!  There's one more thing you need to
compare!"  So, after Kristian S and Aaron I's performance of Madonna's
"Like A Prayer."  Fred and I performed our belt skit.  Again, you had
to be there.
<p>
Talented folks included Kristian S and Aaron I playing guitars, Eric M
playing guitar as Sean M belched the melody, Steve F playing "Rocky
Raccoon," Nancy D reading some of her poetry, Nick G lip synching
Coolio's "Gangsta's Paradise," Suzanne K and Tiffany S singing a
couple songs, Lauren I reading a poem, Jeremy L-N singing "I will
survive," Amy playing flute, Devon singing, and Robert playing piano.
<p>
At 3:AM the talent show kinda ended, and I must say that was the truly
most talented talent show I've seen at a Rally for a long time.
Thanks to all who were involved!
<p>
At about 3:30 we started a game of Silent Football.  I was chosen as
dictator, and dangit, I can't remember everyone who played.  Fred,
Grant, Adam, Bryan, Shawn, Jeremy, Maia, Robert, Nick, and 1 or 2
more.  This game got an amazing amount of interference from entities
outside our universe.  Jeremy lost even though Maia said "his" not
once, twice, or thrice, but 6 times! The game ended at about 5:55am.
This ending time was fortunate because it allowed a phat 5 minutes of
sleep before wake up at 6AM.
<p>
Actually, I slept for about 1.5 hours and just made it back in time for
closing circle.
How wonderful to not be in charge of the rally!
<p>
I got home and slept for 8 hours starting at 2:30pm.</p>

<p class=date>Monday 2 February 1998</p>
<p>
Today I worked from 2am to 9am, babysitting the computers for our end of month processing.  <br>
During this, I read a few chapters of <em>Conversations With God</em> by Neale Donald Walsch.  This book is really incredible and I finished it today after napping once I got home.
<p>
I understand it to describe the main thing to do in life is to be, not to do stuff, but just be.  Just exist and experience life consciously.
<p>
In the book, God also said our physical bodies are designed to last forever.  Cool.
<p>
So, after putting down the book, I asked my body what it needed now in order to continue forever.  
<p>
My body said "stretch."
<p>
With superconscious deliberate movements, I slowly stretched, reminding my outer mind of Tai Chi I learned about two years ago. 
<p>
I just let my hands, arms, legs, back, neck, feet, everything just stretch and flow and move where they wanted.  What a blissful wonderful exercise.
<p>
Thank you, body.</p>
