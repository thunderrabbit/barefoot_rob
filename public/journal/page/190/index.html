<p>Lin and I went to softbank to inquire about charges for her iPad whose
contract was up last year or so.</p>

<p>They helpfully renewed the contract and charge a fucking fee to get
out of it. So while sitting there listening to him explain how it was
impossible to do anything about it even though we didn&rsquo;t use the
service, I folded one of their A4 size laminated ads, deflated their
laptop sized mascot (didn&rsquo;t poke a hole in it, but I thought about
it), and changed the calendar from July to <em>October</em>.</p>

<p>Long way to go before even steven, but that&rsquo;s all the stuff I could
reach.</p>

<p>After getting my computer, I walked up and down the street which had a
few umbrella tables and lots of shoppers instead of cars.  It seemed
like a good thing to post on Periscope, so I did.</p>

<p><a href="https://superuser.com/questions/939251/how-where-does-redmine-calculate-store-spent-time">Redmine Q on
superuser</a>
took more time to research and write than to just rewrite all the time
entries (there are 9), but fuckit; what if I had a million entries?
or a quadrillion? (*)</p>

<p>I logged several time entries to an issue in project A, but they
should have been logged to an issue in project B.</p>

<p>I tried using Redmine GUI to edit the time entries to be associated
with the correct issue, but (because they&rsquo;re in different projects?)
the edit was rejected with &ldquo;invalid issue&rdquo; or something.</p>

<p>So, I logged in to mysql and edited the log entries:</p>

<pre><code>update time_entries set project_id=40, issue_id=2645 where
`issue_id` = 2643;
</code></pre>

<p>Issue 2645 now correctly shows the logged time entries, and the total
&ldquo;Spent time&rdquo;</p>

<p>Issue 2643 correctly does <em>not</em> show any time entries, but still shows
the old value for &ldquo;Spent time&rdquo;</p>

<p>I tried refreshing the page, logging off and on, even using a new
browser, but the value for Spent time persists in issue 2643.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see a field named <code>spent_time</code> in TABLE <code>time_entries</code> or
anything that looks similar when searching for the field name in DB
<code>information_schema</code>.</p>

<pre><code>select * from columns where (column_name like '%spent%' OR
column_name LIKE '%time%') and table_schema = 'redmine';
</code></pre>

<p>How can I tell Redmine to update the value for &ldquo;Spent time&rdquo; after
manually editing entries in TABLE <code>time_entries</code>?</p>

<p>(*) then I probably wouldn&rsquo;t be using Redmine correctly.</p>

<p>ed. note: This entry is crap; do not waste time reading it!</p>

<p>Been going through Learning how to Learn, and just finished the video
on
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/lecture/LurUJ/what-is-a-chunk">Chunks</a>,
the first thing I didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;know&rdquo; already.</p>

<p>After the video, they posed a prompt:</p>

<pre><code>To allow you to better chunk the meaning of chunk, pause and recall,
then write your best synthesis description here of the meaning of
&quot;chunking.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>I answered this answer that&rsquo;s sooo hilarious I just had to put it here.</p>

<pre><code>&quot;best synthesis description&quot; isn't language that was used in the
video, that I can recall, so it seems a bit distracting here.
But, Barbara has not yet chunked the concepts of putting on a jacket
while speaking her lines in front of a camera; they're still distinct
actions for her.
I'm considering chunking this answer and starting anew, but that's
just my focused brain editing while my diffuse brain is putting some
chunks of information on the page.  My wife has just texted me so we
can go on a date, so see ya chumps later!

<p>I had the smart idea of making teams to create and ask questions
instead of just boring-lecturing today&rsquo;s topic.  Two team captains
self-selected and then chose the first 2 peeps on their team, and then
I arbitrarily divided the rest so there would be no last person
selected.</p>

<h2 id="11-50am">11:50am</h2>

<p>During the third hour, in which we were asked to talk about the new
WTC complex, I spoke about the events on the day.  What happened?
Plane hit building.  Right. Then what happened?  Plane hit other
building.  Right. Then what happened to the buildings?  Collapse.
Right.  So how many buildings collapsed?  Two. Okay, and you guys,
what do you think?  Two.</p>

<p>ブッブー  [buzzer onomatopoeia]  Three.</p>

<p>I was glad to see the surprise register on some of the students&rsquo;
faces.</p>

<p>I just touched on the easy points of the story: fire caused
symmetrical collapse; firefighters knew it would collapse before it
did.  BBC knew about the collapse before it did. Silverstein&rsquo;s big
insurance premium.  Planes have wings.  trillions announced lost the
day before, Enron SEC filings in third tower.</p>

<p>Anyway, I then went through the prescribed material about the new
complex: 4 WTC designed by some guy; 1 WTC is 541 meters tall;
reflecting pools are in footprints of towers; etc etc boring junk.</p>

<p>Class ended and I confirmed they remembered the search term WTC 7.</p>

course on Coursera this morning, and was able to correctly answer most
of the questions without watching the videos.  I queued three videos
to watch while out at Higashi-Nakano today, but forgot my earphones,
so might not be able to (unless I do it between lessons, which I
might).</p>

<p>Just finished lunch with Kazu, Tony, Tomomi, Stuart, and Tyrell at a
pizza place apparently rated the 2nd best pizza in Tokyo.  I thought
it was as good as CPK, but not as good as Star Pizza (of course!?)  I
had a four cheese pizza to myself, while the others shared things with
spicey sauce, tomatos, meat, more meat, and some sea food.</p>

<p>Lesson featured 9 students (of ten on my roster), with little or no
class interaction.  Pretty difficult for me so I hope to remember not
to do lessons for junior high school students without a bit of
training first!</p>

<p>One student put his head down several times, though he was actually
one of the most capable in the class, so I guess he was bored.</p>
