<ol>
<li>I started a Meetup group
<a href="https://www.meetup.com/ManKind-Project-Tokyo/">ManKind Project Tokyo</a>
which will soon be linked to the Mankind Project Pro Meetup
account.</li>
<li>Men&rsquo;s group meetings are now every Tuesday (since March).  We had
been meeting twice a month since about August 2015.  The group has
slowly grown and now twice a month is not enough for every man to
do his work.</li>
<li>SOGO is still going, although the leadership is changing.  Menya
was not there today; Maha will soon be moving to Ireland; Michael
left for California last year.  Good job Pinakesh and Sho for
leading the group today!</li>
<li>Marble Track 3 has a grand total of nearly 9 minutes of video.  As
of this moment, the stage is spinning 4 units per frame (pretty
fast) and some characters are affected, but ghostable gluer is not
affected.</li>
<li>I work for JB primarily (Wednesdays and Thursdays in Kawasaki +
Akihabara) Solid Square early Wednesday mornings, from which Chika
has moved on; SCC Wednesday / Thursday afternoons, both for museum
and showspace; JB head office on Wednesday afternoon+evenings for
kids classes alongside Patrick, and adult lessons alongside Matt;
then GG lesson in Akihabara on Thursdays.</li>
<li>After GG on Thursdays I head home for Japanese lesson with Mel in
Chicago, who has free time after getting her son off to school on
their Thursday morning.</li>
<li>Secondarily working for ist with Tariq, with lessons on Monday
mornings.  We had a lot of students up to the end of the year last
year, but they pretty much bounced during the holidays.</li>
<li>Also working for ist on ConSwi, a new game we are developing
<em>slowly</em> but surely with <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot 3</a>.  I am
scheduled to meet Tariq this afternoon in 武蔵小杉 station.</li>
<li>Also working for Tess, with one lesson per week on Mondays around
noon.  Not sure if that will be continued after the next two
lessons coming up in April.</li>
<li>Also working on growing the men&rsquo;s group and hope to figure out a
way to bring enough value to businesses that I can make some money
with it.  For now it is all volunteer.</li>
<li>And volunteering a couple times a month on
<a href="https://www.7cups.com/">7 Cups</a>, etc.</li>
<li>I just received in the mail
<em>Sacred Circles</em> by Robin Deen Carnes and Sally Craig,
<em>The Gifts of Imperfection</em> by Brené Brown, and
<em>Planet on Purpose</em> by Brandon Peele.</li>
<li>Fred got his PhD! in December (I think).  He&rsquo;s teaching C++
courses.</li>
<li>Lin and I have our cat Jennie and live in our house near (ahem, 24
minutes walk from) 新百合ヶ丘 station.</li>
<li>I recently bought a Crayon Shinchan book, and a Doraemon book, but
they are kinda beyond my understanding, unless I go slowly.</li>
<li>I am still using my last ever Macbook Pro.</li>
<li>I got rid of my iPhone and now use a waterproof Android phone,
(which was waterproof before any iPhones were waterproof.)</li>
<li>running out of steam in this SOML.</li>
<li>Oh, I have been using <a href="https://complice.co/?r=pgej30cphu">Complice</a> to get stuff done.  It is
thanks to Complice that I remembered I need to write an SOML today.</li>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not Easter!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&rdquo;?????&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;April Fools!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Finally got back to SOGO today and it was touch!  Camelia (sp) saw me
and was like, &ldquo;remember me??&rdquo; and I was like, &ldquo;I remember your <em>face</em>&ldquo;
(could be an insult, but wasn&rsquo;t in this case), and she reminded me she
had volunteered for <a href="https://peaceboat.org/">Peace Boat</a> since I last
saw her.  So neat to hear that it&rsquo;s growing but still has the same
genki energy as before.  She said in 2020 they are going to have a new
eco-friendly ship!</p>

<p>Next plans in the Marble Track movie:</p>

<ul>
<li>he little brother has just start to walk near the ramps; I do not know where he will go next, but probably off the scene to go look for something fun to do.</li>
<li>The reversible guy about to go back to the switch to make the stage rotate toward the right again.</li>
<li>Candy cane mom has to figure out what track to build next.</li>
<li>Green head guy is about to place rails for a small marble track that comes down from the not quite parallel splitter.</li>
<li>Gluer and cutter characters have nothing to do at the moment.</li>

<p>Actually have gotten three (3) meetings done online: Prentiss and Ari
helped with Mankind Project Tokyo; Ari said he will write some stuff
for either
<a href="https://www.meetup.com/ManKind-Project-Tokyo/">Mankind Project Tokyo Meetup</a>
or <a href="https://tokyo.mypowercircle.org/">My Power Circle</a>.  Oriane and I
checked in with each other on our respective projects.</p>

<p>Planning to ask which inkan I can use for my personal seal today;
maybe I will go do that now on my way to work at TY.</p>

<p>Thanks to Richard for giving me constructive feedback on the first
version which was basically The Agreements, which include a lot of
what we <em>can&rsquo;t</em> do.  He suggested putting some of the benefits on the
site first.</p>

<p>I worked for 90 minutes today and nearly 60 minutes the other day (but
did not put up a new video then).  The latest:</p>


<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

</div>


<p>While the Reversable Guy went to see what happened, the little brother
grabbed onto the chopstick which had kept the stage from rotating
properly.  Before crashing into the ramps, he jumped off; he is fine.</p>

<p>Soon RG will go back to the switch and perhaps find the ramp knocked
over, or maybe the ramp will turn the switch on full blast which could
be fun..</p>

<p>Since June 2017, I have spent

<p>I have two sets of notes descrbing what characters should do.  The
Reversable Guy is trying to figure out why the stage is not rotating.
The green head guy is about to glue a small stick under the ball
splitter.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Candycane Mom has just put the dual track rail in place
down at another ball split point.  It will hold medium-sized and
small-sized marbles.</p>

<p>Lin&rsquo;s mom just got home; she had been at the clinic cause her eye was
all red. From her description to Lin, I don&rsquo;t understand what we might
call it in English, but apparently it happened today while she was at
work.  She was not able to see well and called a different number
while trying to call Lin.  Dr gave her some medicine and tomorrow she
will stay home from work.</p>

<p>Lin is saying her eyes bled internally.  Apparently she might not be
able to see.  Yikes stripes.  I hope she can see perfectly well from now on.</p>
