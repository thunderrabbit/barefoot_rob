                        <p><p class=date>6:49 pm 21 oct 2000</p>

<p><p>Jason day was great fun today.  Got to his house around 9am and he showed
me his stock broker computer program thing that does quotes in total
realtime., including showing so much information that I was overwhilmed even
thought it wasn&rsquo;t even open (stock market)</p>

<p><p>Watched a wakeboard video and then called his friend David.  David wasn&rsquo;t
ready for us yet.  To Jason&rsquo;s work for a seond just so I could see it and I
met his boss Rick.   Then to Jason&rsquo;s e work, a restaurant to eat.</p>

<p><p>I pulled out my Handspring Visor and keyboard, but it wouldn&rsquo;t work.
Doh!!!   I had to do a hard reset on it and then the driver that lets the
keyboard work wasn&rsquo;t there.  So no typing as our day progressed.</p>

<p><p>At soup and caesar salad and Jason got mashed potatoes and sandwich.</p>

<p><p>Then back to his house we rolled on our respective wheels.  Me on
unicycle and Jason on skateboard.  I did really well on uni.  I was able to
uni up the somewhat steep driveway slope (curb height, 2 feet wide) and was
able to roll off the curb!!  That&rsquo;s something I had never previously done.</p>

<p><p>Jason did a bunch of tricks, but kept muttering how he wasn&rsquo;t as good as
he used to be.  He ate it a couple of times and skinned his knee and elbow.</p>

<p><p>Hot sweaty and tired we watched a bit of MTV (one hit wonders from the
80s) while I read TV Guide character profiles of the Simpsons.</p>

<p><p>Before I finished reading (Jason said he would mail it to me when the
week was up) we left for Dave&rsquo;s house, hoping he&rsquo;d be ready when we got
there.</p>

<p><p>We arrived; he was essentially ready.  We hooked up the boat trailer to
his truck and drove to the lake.</p>

<p><p>Jason drove the boat while David wake boarded first.  He did well, jumped
the wake and all that.  Some kicks, but no flips.</p>

<p><p>Jason did a bit higher and longer jumps, and stayed above water for
longer periods of time.</p>

<p><p>When I put the wakeboard on my feet, I was freezing cold, and my feet
barely fit iin the thingies.  I got up on my first try (very easy like Fred
said) but I didn&rsquo;t have enough weight on my back foot.  When I crossed the
wake the first time the water went over the front of the board and that was
it for me.  Pretty hard face smack on the water.  I tucked and covered my
head with my arms.  No real injury.</p>

<p><p>I was all warmed up then and I couldn&rsquo;t fit my feet in the buckles.  So I
put on the skis.  I skiied (sp) fine and even kicked off the other ski and
slalomed for a bit, but crashed pretty soon.  I couldn&rsquo;t get up on slalom
after 3 tries so I went back to 2 skis.  Around the lake a couple times and
then quit intentionally.</p>

<p><p>Flat tire when the tire spun on the grooved boat ramp.  we think it
kicked a nail <em>out</em> of the tire that had already punctured the tire.</p>

<p><p>Jason found a carpenter nail (the kind with two heads so it can be all
the way in and still be pulled out), but it was too big to fill the hole.
He found a small nail that was too small.  David was resigned to changing
the tire, but I found a temple to some glasses. It was just the right size,
so I stabbed t in, broke it off, and the leak was stopped.  We made it back
to David&rsquo;s house no problem.</p>

<p><p>Jason and I left pretty much immediately, he drove me to his house and I
helped him take apart his cell phone ecause it had gotten wet.  I think it
will recover once it dries.</p>

<p><p>See ya later to Jason and I went home.</p>

&ldquo;are you guys coming?&rdquo;  And w were jujst leaving, but we forgot to leave
extra food out for my cat Spot.  Drove back home via Taco Bell and now we
are at Ikea getting shelves for Wende&rsquo;s Aunt Nancy.  The shelves were
unavailable from Ikea two weeks ago when we took the shelf supports to
Nancy.  Soon sooon we will leave.</p>

<p><p class=date>11:39 pm</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;re here at Stacy and Rodd&rsquo;s house in Austin.  just ate ice cream and
felt her pregnant tummy.  (Not Wende&rsquo;s)  She&rsquo;s due in January.</p>

                        <p><title>finished ritz project</title>
<p class=date>12:07am CDT Saturday 21 October 2000</p>

<p><p>Erika, Karla&rsquo;s daughter, drove in from college today.  She hadn&rsquo;t
told any of us; she just showed up!  She worked with us many hours
during the summer; it was good to see her again.  She brought with
herself lunch from James Coney Island; when she walked up behind her
mom and did the hands-covering-eyes trick, Karla was overwhelmed with
the smell of onion, but identified Erika&rsquo;s watch.</p>

<p><p>I just remembered the pseudonym of the project I&rsquo;ve been working
on..  When I first started, I called it the Ritz project.  Just today
we finalized the first rough draft and let our client check it out at
3pm today.</p>

<p><p>Inspired by Erika&rsquo;s choice, Kevin and I walked to James Coney
Island where he got two dogs, chili and water; I got baked potato and
yummy vanilla shake.  Kevin paid as thanks for my long hours on the
project.  I logged 54 hours this week, mostly to the Ritz project.</p>

<p><p>After we got back, we received an email from the ritz client.  They
were less than gracious about its imperfection, and Kevin wrote them
back saying that he was impressed with how much was <em>good</em>
about the project.  The project is in its the first draft, and this is
exactly why we are having them look at it now, and they can just bite
us.  He didn&rsquo;t write that last part, but he said it while writing the
email.</p>

<p><p>I turned off the ringer when I got home at 7pm and slept through
three phone calls,  Jason about our hangout day tomorrow: wake boarding
has been moved to noon, but I can still come early and we&rsquo;ll just hang
out;  Maggie: &ldquo;while the phone was ringing, I decided not to leave a
message&rdquo;; and my dad, asking the brand name of my Handspring Visor and
my Targus Stowaway keyboard, both of which I love.</p>

<p><p>Wende arrived home about an hour ago and is sleeping.  I think I&rsquo;ll
start reading Exodus.  I finished Genesis and was thoroughly offended
at the degradation of women in it.  Only the sons of men were clearly
listed in the genealogies, and women only in terms of who they married
or to what man they were born.  Servant women impregnated in place of
the wives if the wife was &ldquo;barren.&rdquo;  Terrible stuff.  And the worst
offense that I remember now: Lot offering his two virgin daughters to
be raped by the crowd to protect two men in his house.  Gen 19:8</p>

<p><p>Oh, and God said to Abraham &ldquo;your descendants will be like the
stars in the sky.&rdquo; and then in Gen 22, God tests Abraham again and
when Abraham passes the test God goes &ldquo;I will surely bless you and
make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky&hellip; because
you have obeyed me.&rdquo;  Gen 22:17-18.  God had already promised that!!</p>

<p class=date>1:19am CDT Saturday 21 October 2000</p>

<p><p>The following description of the Ritz project is taken from an
email I just wrote to my brother Fred:</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m pleased as shit with this survey for a couple of reasons, which
all stem from one basic thing: Not only do the contents of the
questions come from a database, but the <em>format</em> of the
questions is part of the database.</p>

<p><p>I think all our surveys should be this way, but until now, they
have not.  I&rsquo;m just now at this job for a year, and I&rsquo;m taking
ownership and developing new and fly code.  The main awesome result of
encoding the format: only 1 program is required to display all the
pages of the survey.</p>

<p><p>It used to be that for a 5 page survey, we had 5 programs that all
called each other: &ldquo;here&rsquo;s the data they entered on me; you save my
data and draw yourself.&rdquo;  This wreaked havoc if the user wanted to go
back to a previous page; they would lose their current page of data.</p>

<p><p>Now there are navigation images at the bottom of the screen.  When
the back or continue images are clicked, the program saves exactly the
data that was entered on the page and draws the new page according to
which button was clicked.  Makes perfect sense.</p>

<p><p>The old school method of doing it was developed by a man who has a
masters degree in neuropsychology, not programming.</p>

<p class=date>7pm Thursday 19 October 2000</p>

<p><p>This is from a funny/memorable AIM chat I had with Bryn:</p>

<p><p><b><font color=red>Bryn</font>:</b> Have you ever played cricket?<br />
<br><b><font color=blue>Rob</font>:</b> I&rsquo;ve read about it in Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to
the Galaxy
<br><b><font color=red>Bryn</font>:</b> The cricket season just started here, its
probably the weirdest game ever&hellip;
<br><b><font color=blue>Rob</font>:</b> are you going to learn all the rules?
<br><b><font color=blue>Rob</font>:</b> Then you can teach it to us at a rally
<br><b><font color=red>Bryn</font>:</b> well, thast the thing, there are thousands
of rules, adn on top of that, there are various forms
of cricket&hellip;
<br><b><font color=blue>Rob</font>:</b> &ldquo;This is the game of Cricket, which is
neither silent, nor does it involve a football&rdquo;
<br><b><font color=red>Bryn</font>:</b> then there are day tests (one day match),
and three day tesh matches, so it would be quite odd,
but i am determined to learn how to play
<br><b><font color=red>Bryn</font>:</b> the scoring is the most insane part..
<br><b><font color=red>Bryn</font>:</b> its so boring to watch (because it drags on
and on) that i can&rsquo;t find anyone who goes to the games
to go with
<br><b><font color=blue>Rob</font>:</b> Like what?
<br><b><font color=blue>Rob</font>:</b> Then why do people watch it or play it at
all?
<br><b><font color=red>Bryn</font>:</b> like, someone bowls the ball, you hit it
with a cricket bat to make sure it doesn&rsquo;t break the
wicket (a piece of wood behind the batter) and then
you run about 50 meters to another wicket and stop.<br />
<br><b><font color=red>Bryn</font>:</b> you do this until someone catches a ball
you&rsquo;ve hit or the batter hits the wicket.  then you&rsquo;re
out
<br><b><font color=blue>Rob</font>:</b> &ldquo;break the wicket&rdquo; means hit it and break
it or cross its boundary?
<br><b><font color=red>Bryn</font>:</b> hit it and break it
<br><b><font color=red>Bryn</font>:</b> i actually haev no idea why people play it
at all, but i hear its fun to play with frozen dead
frogs.
<br><b><font color=blue>Rob</font>:</b> NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<br><b><font color=blue>Rob</font>:</b> You&rsquo;re kidding!
<br><b><font color=red>Bryn</font>:</b> See, its kidn of like shooting kangaroos,
which is also fun for people to do here&hellip;
<br><b><font color=blue>Rob</font>:</b> They can&rsquo;t shoot kangaroos!!!  There a
national treasure to us yanks!
<br><b><font color=red>Bryn</font>:</b> its because there are so many.  They
imported these frogs to kill of these beatles, then
when the beatles were dead, the frogs had no
predators, so they overpopulated, and now there are
thousands.
<br><b><font color=blue>Rob</font>:</b> Oh my gosh, so The Simpsons was kinda
right!
<br><b><font color=blue>Rob</font>:</b> I misspelled &ldquo;they&rsquo;re&rdquo; in my haste!
<br><b><font color=red>Bryn</font>:</b> &hellip;and kangaroos are annoying and they eat
all the crops and there are like zillions of them so
people shoot them weekly and run over them with cars,
and thats &ldquo;cool&rdquo;.
<br><b><font color=blue>Rob</font>:</b> Oh my gosh!
<br><b><font color=blue>Rob</font>:</b> I&rsquo;m so distressed!
<br><b><font color=red>Bryn</font>:</b> I don&rsquo;t really have a thought for or
against it.  i am partial to the kangaroos because
they are cute and furry, but i am partial to the
farmers because OZ doesn&rsquo;t import meat or vegetables,
so it doesn&rsquo;t need Roo&rsquo;s eatign everything.
<br><b><font color=blue>Rob</font>:</b> Roos!!!
<br><b><font color=blue>Rob</font>:</b> hahaha</p>

<p class=note>(these are fleeting dream memories)</p>

<p><p class=dream>A kangaroo was dead outside our house.  It was
perfectly intact as if it were a stuffed kangaroo that had simply
fallen flat onto its back.  I called the Agency that handled cleanup
of dead animals and they were surprised to hear of a kangaroo.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Wende said something about our floor squeaking more
when we walked on it.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was back in college and needed to do math homework.
Maggie and I and a couple of others lived in an apartment in the
dorms.  I had the sense I had forgotten about my math homework, but it
wasn&rsquo;t too late to catch up.  I was inspired to begin work on it.</p>

<p><p>I just got home from work.  I have logged 46 hours there so far
this week.  I&rsquo;m super impressed with the coolness of this project.
Not only is the text of the questions stored in a dataset, but the
format in which the questions should be displayed is stored along with
them.  This is allowing a super cool thing:  Instead of having 8
different programs for an 8 page survey, there&rsquo;s just 1 program for an
n page survey.</p>

<p><p>Nice.  We show it to our clients &ldquo;tomorrow&rdquo; afternoon.</p>

<p><p>This weekend is a play play play play weekend.  :-)</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>In a hallway  Actually in a room across from a hallway
with a microphone in it that said ON AIR beside it.  I knew it wasn&rsquo;t
actually on air, but jokingly did a Butt-Head voice from acros the
hall, &ldquo;Ehhh, like is this thing on and stuf?&rdquo;   My friends snickered
along with me.</p>

<p><p class=dream>The door opened across the hall and all sorts of new
wall-sized computer graphics were inside - Scooby Doo eing projected
from the inside wall, and neon light lookin&rsquo; things in the wall, all
animated and all computer generated.</p>

<p><p class=dream>We got a chance to tour down th thing with Mario M from
my old work.  He was happy to do it, but wanted to limit the number of
people in the tour.  About five random youth arrived along with me and
we got to tour.</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m also getting flashes of dream within an old run down poor
neighborhood.  This is a setting I&rsquo;ve seen in a few different dreams
since I started writing them down here.</p>

<p class=date>7:52pm CDT Wednesday 18 October 2000</p>

<p><p>Jason is a stock broker.  He just passed the test like today or
yesterday or something.  So awesome!!!!!!  He said studying for that
test changed his eating habits, his sleeping habits, .. he lost
hair.. but now he passed.  With an 80.  Average score is apparently
74.</p>

<p><p>I could hardly articulate to him how excited super duper pump
thrilled I was to hear the great news!!  I&rsquo;ll definitely open an
account with him and his brokerage.</p>

<p><p>2.5 weeks ago Jason and I scheduled a hang out day for this coming
Saturday.  We&rsquo;re going to go wakeboarding, which seems wussier than
skiing, but I won&rsquo;t know until I try it.</p>

<p class=date>6:40am CDT Wednesday 18 October 2000</p>

<p><p>Back in the day, Maggie and I would spend countless hours in the
computer lab on the VAX when a project was due.  I might need to do
that for a project at work due on Friday.  This project is a pretty
awesomely cool one; I&rsquo;m excited to work on it.  What I recognize is
that I need to allow myself to take breaks during the day and go in to
work at night.  Aww yeah.</p>
