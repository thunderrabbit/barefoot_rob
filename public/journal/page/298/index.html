  Miki fired herself by not being willing to try going to Farm Grill
  in Ginza.  I can't hang with someone who chooses to be so helpless.
  I will however, still give her the art thing I made for her.  I
  closed it today; I was going to draw about twice as much, but it
  suddenly appeared finished after I saw it again today.</p>

<p class=date>11:47pm</p>

<p>I want to be more specific about this.  She said, "I can't go to
  Ginza because I have never been there before and I can't read a
  map."</p>

<br>wish i could see it.<br>
  one thing i love about your art is how every line is new.  like it jumps directly from your brain,squiggles down your arm, crawls onto your hand, then on to the canvas.<br>
  and how much energy is there on a piece of paper.</p>

<p>§Ê§ﬂ cancelled tonight (because Gateway 21 is closed today) so I
emailed Õµª“ and said we could hang out after all.</p>

<p>Õµª“ called me after her work and drove out to πÀ≈Á where we ate
  at Miho's and studied Japanese at my apartment for a bit.  She read
  the robot crab story to me in Japanese and then I read (read made
  up) an English version for her given the pictures in the story.</p>

<p>Recognized the huge danger of having her spend the night so sent
  her home.  I'm going to hang with her tomorrow at 2 in Cinecitta and
  we'll go check out the bajillion lights at Millenario (sp) somewhere
  near Ginza I think.</p>

<p>Called janette and now I'm bout to go to bed bed bed.</p>

<p>I'm on the couch at Carla's (and whaddya know it looks like I've
  got an internet signal) after watching _The Piano_ and then
  tallllking talking talking about life the universe and what we're
  doing in it.</p>

<p>"What's money?"  (just plan and do whatever you want to do; don't
  worry about the money)</p>

<p>"Savor the moment"  (I am right here in Japan <em>IN JAPAN</em>
  and I have Carla (whose brain I love) all to myself and I choose to
  savor this moment)</p>

<p>"Just say HI" (force yourself to say HI to the new people who come
  to work until it comes naturally)</p>

<p>I asked Carla specifically what her issues are.  It was good to
  hear that she has some.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>This is the night Dan didn't take his key and locked himself out
  and came here to borrow my key.</p>

<p>Also the night that we saw 6 cop cars, 7 cop motorcycles, (a
  baker's dozen cops,) a crowd of people on the street down from
  Carla's apartment.  We couldn't tell what was quite so interesting.</p>

<p>Also the night that we saw some guys carrying flashlights and
  hitting sticks together in some kind of nighttime (end of year?)
  flashlight carrying stick hitting ceremony.</p>

<p>I specifically asked Carla for a hug as we said good night.
  "You're a good person," she told me.  <em>thank you for telling
  me</em> "you are, too."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>As the movie ended, it was 11:30 and trains were still running so
  I could go home.  But I wanted to stay at Carla's tonight.  So I
  could talk with her.  But part of my brain was caught up in the
  naughtiness of wanting to stay at Carla's that I couldn't think of
  anything to talk about with her.  Finally I overcame it and we
  talked about all the good stuff mentioned above.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I believe there is a balance between falling in love with my life
  as it is, and seeking things in my life to help me fall in love
  with my life.  I want to fall in love with life with someone
  (partner) to share it with.  And I want to do my own thing on my
  own schedule.</p>

<p>I was willing to spend the money to come watch a movie with Carla,
 but I wouldn't have spent the money on a movie for myself.  There's a
 lesson underneath that as well.  I was willing to go to Hawaii with
 janette, but less willing to spend the money to go to ____ (Egypt,
 Viet Nam, Singapore) alone.</p>

<p>There's a balance between not going into debt to do the things I
  want, and not doing the things I want until I can "afford" to do
  them.</p>

<p>I don't often want to be not the last person to leave the party
  because I don't want to miss anything, and I don't want to let
  anyone down.  I had to consciously realize that it was okay for me
  to leave Houston; I didn't need to ask for permission.  I seem to
  want permission to take care of myself.</p>

I love what Caulfield is wearing!  Ice skates on a chair!  I've tried
to wear inline skates and drive a car (kinda easy), ride a bicycle
(pretty easy), ride a unicycle (not as easy) and ride a skateboard
(basically impossible).  But I've never tried to slide down a hill on
chair in a big bowl while wearing ice skates.

Thank you for the word convalescence.

HAHA!  may I make a copy of this for my website?  It will soon be
buried in my journal and I'll link to comics.com/frazz Many people
ride bikes and talk on phones here in Japan; we teachers complain
about it a lot.  (and do it ourselves on occassion)

I hope your holidays rule.

Thanks! The sledding outfit is something from my past,
no doubt. Where do all the adults come from, anyway?
And, given things like driving with cell phones, where
do all the old adults come from? It's amazing any of
us live to see another day!

By all means, link that web site to Frazz. Thanks!

<p>Last time I washed my jeans and wanted to wear them the next day,
  they were FAR too wet to wear so I had to wear something else.  Last
  night I washed my jeans and left them in front of the heater vent.
  They are dry.</p>

<p>Met § §ﬂ today in Shibuya.  Haven't seen her since her tap
  performance.  We went to kaitein sushi (much to her surprise that I
  liked it) and had 8 plates each.  (2 sushi pieces per plate, except
  for the two cheap plates which had 1)</p>

<p>Went to a tarp flea market near NHK where I didn't buy for janette
  a cute ring holder couch thing because she sells bigger antique
  things than rings I think.  She was at a movie when I called and
  when she called back, she assured me she would like the couches, but
  I was like "too late, g."  I wondered how much of my convo Nami
  could understand.  I did find out that the fleas will be back there
  on the two Sundays that janette will be in town.  Maybe we can buy
  some couches then.</p>

<p>Sat on a log in the same park that janette and I sat near the
  fountain that day and I gave Nami some fudge (super special thanks
  to janette for the fudge!) and a sugar cookie shaped like an
  ornament with my name on it.  Eeeeee!!  I'm famous!</p>

<p>I ate all the other cookies except the one labeled DAN.  Lucky man,
  that Dan.  He was really happy to get it,
  "she's <em>premium</em>!"</p>

<p>Yes.  yes indeed.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Nami had to work at 4pm, so we didn't hang out all day.  I fell
  asleep on the train home, fucked around online and slept some at
  home and now I'm going to Carla's house to watch a movie and
  hopefully have a chance to really talk real talk with Carla.  I hope
  no one else is there.  Not that I want to kiss her (I don't, much),
  but I do want her to myself for talking purposes.</p>

<p>I was wearing my mouthguard for bed when Carla and I started our
  email volley; I forwarded to her an email address from a French cat
  named Olivier who is looking to talk to French teachers in Nova to
  see what the environment is like for them.  Then she's like, "what
  are you doing?" and I'm like "nothing what are you doing?" and now
  we're going to watch a movie.</p>

<p>Oh, the point is that I'm still wearing my mouthguard as I'm on the
  train to her house; I forgot to take it out.  I guess I can stay
  over.</p>

<p>(on the couch!)</p>

<p class=dream>I was a spy and was asked to sneak into a small room
  and use a power drill with a grinder bit to cut a power cable to
  the building.  The room had a glass window and a bad guy was
  cleaning the window from the other side with a power sprayer. I
  wondered if, like in a movie, he would cover the window with suds,
  just allowing me to cut the calbe before he saw me.</p>

<p class=dream>He didn't cover the entire window, and the room started
  to move.  Oh, the room was white and I was wearing a black body
  suit, though he still didn't see me.  The room started to move a
  bit, making it difficult for me to freeze myself (in an
  uncomfortable position to make it look like I must be dead (or
  sleeping)) against one corner, but that's what I did.</p>

<p class=dream>He continued to not see me, but (Mike's) high school
  Miki came up and she saw me from the bad guy's side of the window.
  She came into the room and I began to actually fall asleep, which I
  didn't exactly want to do cause I wanted to stay aware of the
  situation, and she came up to me and I figured she was my friend and
  wanted to help so I was like, "distract that guy" or "turn off the
  lights" or something and she ignored me or didn't understand or had
  her own objectives.</p>

<p class=dream>She got really close and gave me a kiss on the cheek
  and the guy noticed now and he started to chase me.  I knew I could
  fly so I flew horizontally down the hallway (*) and then up through
  the roof of the building so I was outside flying among the trees
  above a garden party with a lot of well dressed bad guys (men and
  wonmen) discussing whatever bad guys discuss at garden parties.</p>

<p class=dream>I was being chased by more people who could fly, so
  when they came up to my level, I launched myself up higher than they
  could fly.  (haha beat that, suckas!) and then HS Miki came up to me
  and we and I told her I love her and we started kissing.</p>

<p class=dream>Told her that I want to marry her and she was like,
  "cool," and our friends were like, "okay, take these [marriage
  licenses (that looked like drivers licenses)] that we forged before
  and put them in your wallet."  So we weren't actually married, but
  we could claim we were; we had the documents to prove it.</p>

<p class=dream>We were then free of the bad guys and I was walking
  alone down Methil street (**) and saw Suzanne with some kids she was
  babysitting.  She was dropping them off to someone else, so she had
  some free time.  We were in an S&M bar and I gave her a huge
  spanking, though I couldn't quite get the right [smack], and it was
  more like just hitting her with my palm.  No [crack!] of a good
  swat.</p>

<p class=dream>She was still happy with them and we walked out, "thank
  you; see you later," and we were walking and saw Neil and Ryan
  walking to work.  Neil was on his cell phone saying, "I'm going to
  work now, yeah in Shibuya" and I was like, "did you hear him say
  Shibuya?" to Suzanne, wondering if she could understand the language
  here in Japan.  (he was speaking in English)</p>

<p>Woke up two minutes before my alarm went off.</p>

<p>(*) quite lucid if I can fly horizontally; usually up is all I can
manage.</p>

<p>(**) my old house (when I was 8 yrs to 13 yrs old)</p>

<p>Ate at Farm Grill in Ginza, the restaurant DruDaddy and that guy
  and I ate at some months ago, maybe to celebrate our end of
  probation paychecks.  Large buffet and all I can drink and good
  stuff like that.  Lubo, §¢§§§≥, Grace, Kat, §´§™§Í, Dan, Orivia, Jen
  and I were there for two hours (time limited) of chowing.</p>

<p>Rode on the train beside §´§™§Í who helped me study my vocab flash
  cards (need to buy some more; I lost my new set, but most of them
  were blank; I'm happy about that) which I was quite happy to do
  instead of sitting with the Went home to πÀ≈Á with the group and
  they drank more at the izakiah they frequent near the station.
  Morag joined us after a while.</p>

<p>M-dawg and I were wide eyed at each other as the drunken sillifolk
  repeatedly trying to photograph a little 1.5 inch tall David Beckham
  doll with an oversized head as he dove into a glass of ice
  water.</p>

<p>Wow.  I'm in Odaiba with Carla, Kaori, Mamiko, Benny, Melanie, and
  Clayton.  Eating buffet (actually I'm eating just calamari cause
  I'm going to a buffet tonight).</p>

<p>The mood music, here in Sizzler, a family steak restaurant with
  kids and moms and dads and us, is NIN "closer."</p>

<p>No, it's not censored.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>We saw the Korean drug ship §¡§Á§¶§Í§Á§¶ (Chyorio) that got sunk by
  the Japanese and the Korean government said, "hey man that ship
  wasn't a drug ship."</p>

<p>So the Japanese then recovered it and found all this proof that it
  was a drug ship.  It's now on display.</p>

<p>D'oh.  Due to my silly battery, I won't be able to write again
  after I close this, but hey.  I gotta eat.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>of note: Carla and Benny indicated that being the leader all the
  time is not all it's cracked up to be. (I can tell I'm sleepy).</p>

<p class=dream>I was masturbating in my room and realized that people
  outside behind me could see me so I stopped and turned around.
  They were peeking out their windows, and looked like they hadn't
  seen me, but then one guy does a jackoff motion question mark and
  I (in a cheerful way) gave them the finger.  "haha fuck you for
  looking" kinda thing.</p>

<p class=dream>One of the guys came outside and was talking to me and
  then dreamshift and I was watching this bird slash friend eat
  seeds, but he couldn't pick up a certain seed with his beak so he
  cocked his head over to pick it up with his <b>eye</b> using
  adhesion from his tears (*)</p>

<p class=dream>I was like, "hey um, Mr bird, what name can we humans
  call you?"</p>

<p class=dream>He was like, "Poppyseed"</p>

<p class=dream>"Poppyseed, did you just pick up that seed with your eye??"</p>

<p class=dream>"Yeah blah blah blah..." some explanation he gave made perfect
  sense to us.</p>

<p class=dream>Wow; cool.  We had a newfound respect for the nature of
birds.</p>

<p>(*) not tears, but ambient eye moisture.  Is there a word for that?</p>

<p class=dream>Dreamshift and then we were with Samuel L Jackson who
  was doing fung shi on his new house that was rather huge.  I helped
  him walk around the perimeter and seal it with a symbolic fan of
  some sort.</p>
