<p>Tuesday night <a href="https://www.mkpjapan.org">Tokyo Mankind Project</a> men&rsquo;s
circle met in Shinjuku for the first time in our hourly-rented space.</p>

<p>The space worked well, so I have booked it for the next three months&rsquo;
worth of Tuesdays.  It&rsquo;s clean, quiet, has cool chairs and beautiful
hardwood floor.  Plus it&rsquo;s only about 2 minutes from Shinjuku station,
so come on out!</p>

<p>We have not sorted out how the group will pay for it exactly.  We had
donations of 5500 yen last night, though the room cost around 7000
yen.  We are having discussions on LINE about each man donating 500
yen per week regardless of attendance.  That will hopefully encourage
men to attend.</p>

<p>On Monday I got email working with AWS SES.  It was pretty much
plug-n-play level of easy since I already had a site set up that had
been using <a href="https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer">PHPMailer</a>.</p>

<p>But eff me I could not figure out what was different from the setup on
our old server which was sending emails from itself using Exim no
problem.</p>

<p>We had a typhoon Sunday night / Monday morning.  It was fine for us,
but a doozy in some parts of our area.  People died.</p>

<p>Two high tenstion power towers collapsed.</p>

<p>And the one that amazes me most for its precision destruction, a net
blew down from a golf driving range and sliced roofs of houses.

<p>For me, it was pretty chill.  I did not have to go out, so I walked
with Lin to the station and had a drink with her while waiting for the
train.  Everything calmed down in our station and she got on the train
no problem&hellip; but then in Shinjuku, it took ONE HOUR to change lines
from Odakyu Line to Yamanote Line.</p>

                        <p>I am excited about Remembering Past Lives workshop today</p>

<p>(written 17:13 Thursday 12 September 2019 JST:)</p>

<p>Two people in attendance and had a good time!  Great to hear their
questions at the beginning.  One was &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the process?&rdquo;</p>

<pre><code>Each participant gets into a relaxed position, usually either sitting
in a chair, or laying down, or otherwise sitting against something
comfortable.

I will spend a few minutes leading you through a relaxation process,
whereby you let your body relax and keep your mind awake.  Once you
are in this mind awake / body asleep mode, I'll invite you to imagine
getting up and leaving the room.  In your mind I will guide you to
travel far away, whether by vehicle, or through a cave, or through a
forest and arrive somewhere familiar.

I will give you a chance to explore the familiar area, including
seeing other inhabitants of the area and moving around and
communicating with them.

I will lead you gently back the way you came, allowing you to have
clear memory of what happened and what you heard and saw.  Once your
awareness focuses back on your physical body, you will have a chance
to write down what you heard and saw.  We will not speak until
everyone is pretty much done writing.

The whole process is a state of light hypnosis, and you will still
have full control and awareness of where your physical body is.  You
will be able to come back in a moment's notice if you choose.

Each process will take about 20 or 30 minutes.
</code></pre>

<p>One participant saw the same place in two of the three excursions we
did.  The other saw some of the same imagery twice, but did not report
as clear of a vision of the place itself.</p>

<p>All in all, a great time!</p>

<li>Yesterday I walked from Shinjuku to Hiroo, from the men&rsquo;s group new
meeting location to our old one.  Last night we met for the last
time at Takeshi&rsquo;s office, and next week we will be in Shinjuku, at
a place I have not yet seen.  I have booked it for all of September
and October, and trust we can get it for longer if we like it.</li>
<li>I did my first workshop last month (Eye Gazing, on August 17th).
We had a great turnout so I am planning to do it again on September
28th.  Yay!</li>
<li>Last night Mark gave me the idea of doing workshops for a living.
It certainly fits my skillset <a href="/journal/2019/09/03/brain-pounding-eyes-vibrating-too-much-computer/">moreso than programming</a>!</li>
<li>Marble Track 3 now features CSFERP (Caret Splitter Feeder
Extenstion Reflection Protection), put in place yesterday by
Reversible Guy.</li>
<li>I have not yet gotten into the groove of writing blog entries, but
recently I have put that on my daily ROBOT pages as a 10 point todo
item.</li>
<li>I have been keeping daily ROBOT pages since May, thanks to Hiro for
the idea.</li>
<li>I had my first session with Dean Ramsden.  It was less illuminating
than I guessed/hoped it might be, but I have different sets of
questions for next time.</li>
<li>Lin and I have been doing better over the past month or more,
mostly because I have been chilling tf out and being more
accomodating for communication styles and grammars.</li>
<li>I got AB&rsquo;s DB moved to AWS RDS.  Yay!  Thanks to Travis for
introducing me to Ansible.  Thanks to Ansible for making things
replicable.</li>
<li>I created a Page on FB.
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/barefootrob/">Barefoot Rob</a>.  I
resisted giving in to the borg for a long time, and still want to
keep my content on my server, but they make it so dang easy!</li>
<li>I am ecstatic with the turnout from
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2465227863708851/">my first Eye Gazing workshop</a>;
14 people attended, incluing myself.  I have scheduled a second
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/493730671447073/">Eye Gazing workshop</a>
for Sep 28th, and a
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2054284838201319/">Remembering Past Lives</a>
workshop for September 7th.  Looking forward to both!</li>
<li>I have been fascinated with the idea of channeling information
from non-local sources.
<a href="https://www.bashar.org/">Bashar via Darryl Anka</a> is the first
that I paid attention to, and now Abraham via
<a href="https://www.abraham-hicks.com">Esther Hicks</a>.  I wonder about
developing my own channeling skills.</li>
<li>Jennie is still our cat. Lin recently said Jennie is 7 years old.</li>
<li>I still do not have a driver&rsquo;s license in Japan (nor the US, since
my old license expired).  Lin wants me to get one, but I do not
really want to drive in Tokyo.  Especially not have to drive her
&ldquo;big&rdquo; minivan.</li>
<li>I showed up 25 minutes late to my online group today and no one
was there.  It&rsquo;s like my worst dream come true, after I had just
written a page of gratitude to the men of the group for keeping it
going while I am not in attendance.</li>

<p>I slept on 南武 line from 登戸 to 川崎 station today.  Nice to get a
57 minute sleep on a 30 minute trip.  (The train sits in Noborito for
27 minutes before departing.)</p>

<p>Early morning lessons on Wednesday are back after the summer break.
I&rsquo;ve been teaching here for some years, &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t mind&rdquo; if the lessons
were taken over by someone else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t mind&rdquo; in quotes because that was the phrase Eriko
doublechecked with me to be true regarding the lesson.</p>

<h5 id="09-46">09:46</h5>

<p>The lesson was fine today, and I wouldn&rsquo;t mind coming back next week
(probably).  Ayano, Satoshi, Ai, and I talked about summer vacation
for a minute and then dove back into the book.  To help them be
involved in their own learning, I have taken to having them be
&ldquo;manager&rdquo; for various exercises in the text.  This helps me because I
might otherwise skip or dwell on something too difficult or easy for
them.</p>

pounding headachey and my eyes were vibrating in a strange way like,
not in a good way.</p>

<p>I chalk it up to too much time spent on my computer.</p>

<p>it kept me awake for a while, but I was finally able to calm myself
down into sleep.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m headed to Nathan&rsquo;s dentist which is now my dentist.</p>

<p>I like this dentist because he didn&rsquo;t waste time checking my teeth
three (3) appointments in a row without doing anything.</p>

<p>First appointment: &ldquo;I recommend you fix this; wanna do it now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes!</p>

<p>He worked on two teeth, and best I can understand, he filled a filling
on the left lower third from back tooth, which also suffers from gum
disease (receding gum).  He also smoothed down a filling on the right,
saying it had been placed too thick on the tooth and kind of covered
the gum (like a roof, not a wall)</p>

<p>Jimmy messaged me on youtube near the end of my nearly 3 hour
livestream.  During the livestream I got about 2 seconds of video
taken, during which Reversible Guy installed the Caret Splitter Feeder
Extension Reflection Protection.  They work quite well!</p>

                        <p>Neat to hear Dean say my questions were all great and could all be
explored for a year long course.</p>

<p>The overall answer I got was quite in-line with MKP work: find my true
self and bring that forward into the world.</p>
