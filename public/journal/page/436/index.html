<p>Just getting off work at Prestonwood.  I actually drove, so I'm
about to drive back, but I don't seem to have the same (any)
passengers.</p>

<p>But, the reason I'm writing is that as we were signing out, this
cat named Pat was all, "who's Bob Nugen?" all loud and shit.  I raised
my hand and he goes, "if you ever write that kind of shit on the
timesheet again you'll never work in this state again."</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>I guess I shouldn't write "Pat is a big fucking moron" on the
timesheet.</p>

<p>Of course, I <em>didn't</em> write that on the timesheet.</p>

<p>I had clocked out and back in for lunch at 12:45 and back at 2:30.</p>

<p>"You don't gotta write the damn minutes and seconds on this; just
write the nearest hour."</p>

<p>"I like to be precise."  What I might have said was, "I wanted to
be honest that I took longer than 1 hour for lunch," but I didn't.</p>

<p>Now I'm wondering why oh why would he complain?  Hard to add up
times to the nearest 45 minute mark?  Man, fuck him.</p>

<p class=date>7:59pm</p>

<p>Wow.  Getting home from work took 1.5 hours cause traffic was so
stinky.</p>

(midnight) and the night before (2am).</p>

<p>As I'm falling asleep, I'm thinking of my friend Kristen who has
just passed the bar; she'll be a lawyer by the end of the month.
Super congratulations to her.</p>

<p>Back at the shop now after being at Prestonwood this morning.  I
think I have targeted what is frustrating about working here.  The
rules seem to change continually.  Not rules so much as the
directions/instructions/ideas-on-what-to-do-next.  And who's in charge
here?  Johnny is overwhelmed with details and doesn't seem to have
enough people to delegate to or something.</p>

<p>At the (correct) warehouse near Prestonwood, Hector jumped onto the
forklift, but then this tall cowboy lookin' guy whipped out his wallet
to prove he had a fork lift operator license, like it was a fuckin'
contest.  Hector conceded without complaint, but then refused to drive
the other forklift when Vince suggested that the other forklift would
be helpful.</p>

<p>I, on the other hand, had a great time climbing up these huge
stockyard shelves, like 40+ feet tall.  I started thinking of some of
the drop down lists I could have on my comment section, for example:</p>

<pre>
Why did you climb      that?
            jump over
        skate on
            drink
            eat
            write
</pre>

<p>Or something like that.</p>

<p class=date>8:01pm</p>

<p>Done with work.  Most amazing was a cat named Robert, who
introduced himself as Cornbread to me.  He was the guy who was all
whippin' out his forklift license.  I assure you he was good.
<em>And</em> I got to ride on the forklift!  I was the counterweight
to keep some decks from falling off.  SO SO so much fun!!</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>At a rally at Aaron Ryan's house, like a farm and he
neeeded to cut down a large tree in his back yard and that fact had
been advertised on the rally flyer.  But when he cut it down, no one
was watching except me and it fell into a the neighbor's yard and
knocked down one of their trees.  Actually Aaron's tree was so
enormous that its branches basically dwarfed and bullied over the
neighbor's tree, and it fell on their roof and destroyed their garage
at first, and then smashed to bits their home.</p>

<p class=dream>They ran out of the house and we were all "oh shit" so
we ran over and I was thinking "ah they needed a new home anyway"
Their old house was unpainted now after years of wear and boards were
all falling apart and such.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>'you create a diversion," I said to my friend.</p>

<p class=dream>We were in a mental hospital, so he starting spraying
shaving cream on the walls and theatening to kill someone.</p>

<p class=dream>I became him and sprayed shaving cream thickly at the
floors, with a spray can powerful enough to shoot like a waterhose
worth of foam at once.  I said threatening things like, "I'm going to
kill so and so" or something and people started fleeing or calling the
cops and security in the hospital.</p>

<p class=dream>I was simply trying to keep them from getting my
friend.</p>

<p class=dream>I went up the wide staircase and sprayed shaving cream
all over the hard tile surface, making them quite slick and dangerous.
So when I saw someone starting to chase me, I ran back and jumped down
all the stairs and carefully slid on the tile and slid along the
corner wall and around the corner and jumped down the next flight of
steps......</p>

<p class=dream>So then I was running and jumped down some more stairs
and out a door and since I knew I had to do this for real, I decided
that I needed a real way to escape, so instead of flying, I had
installed a trapeeze outside the door hanging off the overhang roof
thing and jumped out the door and with such force that when I grabbed the
trapeze, I just flew up it in a 270 degree arc and flopped onto a big
soft foam rubber cushion on the roof.  safe.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>Driving Karaoke, Janette, and Jack really fast down
some clay hills streets of Dallas, except we were riding on a dolly.
Very fun wizzing around on that.</p>

<p class=dream>We headed quickly down a hill on which we had to turn
at the bottom, but they got off before we got to the bottom. I was a
bit offended that they wouldn't trust that I could stop the dolly
smoothly in time.  I did, but it was no problem to go back and get
them, knowing that I at least, had successfully navigated that hill at
high speed.</p>

<p>I called Jennifer N-P twice tonight since she says we need to meet
before Friday.  At 8pm, soon after I called her the second time, while
I happened to be removing a rat worth of long hair from the shower
drain as a community service to this homestead, the phone rang and it
was for me.</p>

<p>This is the first (first!) time that I've received a phone call
here, so I assumed it was Jennifer.  After smalltalk, including "yeah,
I just removed a rat sized wad of hair from the shower," I was all,
"so do we need to meet face to face, or can we meet over the phone?"</p>

<p>"Um, remember I live in Houston."</p>

<p>!!!!! um um um um um, "Hi Maraiah!"</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>What's awesome to hear is how she's going through such great
personal growth.  It might mean (the beginning of) the end of her four
year relationship, since he is apparently choosing not to grow as
well.  It's actually a bit scary to me; I get a sense that he has the
patience of someone who might obsessively focus on her (read stalk) if
she breaks up.</p>

<p>But I don't know him as well as she does, and she's a smart girl,
who thinks carefully about her actions and how'll they'll affect her
future.</p>

<p>She and Sarah are going to embark on a long roadtrip, hopefully an
ultimate roadtrip together.  Ultimate because they would each choose
to leave their kids/dogs with parental units during the adventure.</p>

<p>She mentioned that I hadn't posted anything to my journal in 2
days, and that she found my site rather addicting and missed her daily
fix of my writing.  Flattering that she said I write well.   Told her
that I was considering putting a way for people to post comments to my
entries, but that I would not allow comments to comments on my site.
Fuck all that.</p>

<p>Maraiah was all, "oh my gosh" or something when I mentioned UUism
as my youth group work.  That's what came up when she took a test on
what religion she was.  That and something Buddhism.  Not quite as
accessible as UUism.</p>

<p>We talked about Sarah some, and how we both want the best for her,
though sometimes it seems that Sarah is unwilling to consider putting
herself first.  She almost certainly won't put herself in front of her
girls, but she doesn't think of herself before *anyone*, it seems to
me.</p>

<p>I was going to tell her a confusing bit about <em>The Ring</em>,
but she asked that I not tell her before she goes to see it so we can
discuss it.</p>

<p>I told her I was thankful for our relationship since we've never
gotten romantically involved (although we've talked about it).  That
makes it easier for me to be comfortable yammering with her about
anything and everything now.</p>

<p>Lotta interesting things at work today.  Got to see the warehouse,
which amounts to a big big metal shack with a gate.  After Vince
wasn't brash enough, Charles drove backwards like a bulldozer through
a pile of garbage to get the Ryder truck up to the gate.</p>

<p>Got to see the God Dome, I mean Prestonwood Church in Plano.  Big.
We're helping set up their stage for Christmas.</p>

<p>Vince drove me and Jeramiah back to the warehouse to get stairs,
but we couldn't find the stairs.  Turns out it was the wrong
warehouse.  Johnny just asked us to get two 6x6 foot pallets while we
were there, and at the same time-ish, two cats from off the street
offered to help us load stuff.  They loaded the pallets for us and
moved a set of stairs back, which we had moved while looking for the
correct stairs.  I gave them each $1 for their efforts (10 minutes of
work) and they whined until I gave them another $1 to split between
them.  Shit.</p>

<p>Then when Vince got back in the truck for us to drive away, it
wouldn't go into drive.  Just stuck in park.  Put the parking brake
on, the pedal brake on, turned the engine off and back on... nothing.
Couldn't get it out of park.  Until suddenly he was able to get it out
of park.  Weird.  I'm glad we didn't have to call Ryder peeps to come
help us.</p>
