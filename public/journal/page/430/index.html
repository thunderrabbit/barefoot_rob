<p>Josephine is the best splinter getter outer ever.</p>

<p class=date>9:29pm</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>We've been playing since June.  Josephine just tonight got the
correct answer to the game of Infinite Questions that we've been
playing.</p>

<p>"The word 'aight' as spoken by John Travolta in the beginning of
<em>Pulp Fiction</em> at the world premier."</p>

<p>*Then* I realized I had approved the wrong answer; it was Samuel L
Jackson, so I told her this, then "okay start over; new game: infinite
questions."</p>

<p>"The word 'aight' as spoken by Samuel L Jackson at the world
premier of <em>Pulp Fiction</em>."</p>

<p>"<em>Oh my god that's right!!!!</em>"</p>

<p>I got to ride the truss down and back up today!  That was certainly
a highlight of my work day.  I climbed the steps to get to the
catwalks and where the trusses are flying (by fly they mean hang) to
set the limit on the curtains (keep them from being closed too far)
and to adjust some of their heights.</p>

<p>Chris (my new hero) slid down the chain when the truss was lowered
(I could have done that but didn't get the chance since I rode down
with the truss).  That was cool enough, but even better is that he
<em>climbed</em> the chain back up to the top!  That's like 40 feet,
and the chain is no velvet rope to hang from.  I'm impressed.</p>

<p>And for some reason he thinks he's scrawny.</p>

<p>Yesterday I mostly worked, which consisted of getting a blood
blister on my finger, two splinters in my hand, bonking my head on a
truss, getting to climb onto and walk along a truss to tie a curtain
onto it, helping Janette sew the bottom of a curtain with her portable
sewing machine at Prestonwood.</p>

<p>Yesternight I read a chapter of Stranger in a Strange Land to
Janette (where Jubal tests Mike's ability to make things vanish), had
Janette get splinters out of my hand (she had Josephine do it cause
Janette couldn't see them well enough), looked for meteors for about 3
minutes until I declared it too fucking cold to be outside.</p>

<p>And, if I remember correctly, yesterday was Tammy's birthday.</p>

<p>Just got back from seeing <em>8 Mile</em> with Josephine.  Jack and
Janette had come too, but the movie times didn't work out well, so
they went back home.  I am thankful to Janette for her willingness to
come pick us up after our movie.</p>

<p>I had put the tickets on my credit card, and when we refunded their
two tickets, the guy gave me cash back.  So that's a sneaky way to get
cash on my credit card without knowing the pin number.</p>

<p>The movie was great.  I was hyped during the battle scenes at the
end.  Some cat in the theater said the movie was dumb for ending the
way it did.  He just don't understand.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>In the theater, there were two young children, like 2 or 3 years old.</p>

<p>Also, the guy in front of us answered a phone call and
<em>made</em> a phone call during the movie.  I kicked his seat
forward and then immediately felt sorry for being equally
disrespectful as he.</p>

<p>I just got off the phone with Sally while driving home to Dallas
from San Antonio after the youth advisor training.</p>

<p>So great to confirm profound robust everlasting love for one
another, even as she's dating a local guy named Rick who she's known
for a while.</p>

<p>Once she told me that, we went on to all the other subjects in the
world, including how awesome the other is, and about learning
languages and I was all, "oh oh oh oh!  I learned how to say 'ti
crecivaya de rushka' which means 'you are a beautiful girl' in
Russian." and just as I was saying it, all excited to be talking to
Sally, I saw a state trooper chillin' just on the downside of a hill.
I looked down and saw I was going 80.  D'oh.</p>

<p>That's why I seemed a bit distracted while saying you are a
beautiful girl in Russian.</p>

<p>But he stayed put, and I slowed down.  It was all great all
around.</p>

<p>And she likes Eminem.  :-)  Maybe doesn't love him as much as we
love The B eastie Boys, but it's alll good.</p>

<br>I am just checking out this &ldquo;comment&rdquo; thing! I love the drop down menu with &ldquo;why did you climb that?&rdquo; HA!<br>
<br>
And I love this: &ldquo;We just went by a big store called <em>Barbecues Galore</em>. It&rsquo;s one of the freestanding stores in a shopping mall parking lot.&rdquo; I remember seeing that and thinking the exact same thing. I actually want to buy a barbeque pit so it&rsquo;s too bad I&rsquo;m not in Texas now. hee hee<br>

Thank you for the nice journal entry. As you would say, I am thankful for that.<br>

<p>I've been in bumper to bumper traffic for the past hour.  From the
point where it started, I would normally have been home in 20
minutes.  But not this time.  I just spent 20 minutes on the phone
with Josephine as she determined with the Texas Department of Public
Safety website that there was an accident ahead of me, but it's now
cleared.  So hopefully things will speed up a bit soon.  But they
haven't yet.</p>

<p>For an hour Scott has been either in first gear or neutral,
sometimes with the parking brake on.</p>

<p class=date>8:07pm</p>

<p>The traffic snarl was due to a van stalled in the right center lane
of the four lane freeway.</p>

<p>In my room, there used to be boxes in the unused bathtub and no
window treatment in the bathroom.  The toilet and sink did work,
though; that was enough for me.</p>

<p>But now I find that the bathtub has been cleared out, a thoughtful
curtain put up, and even flowers in a small vase on the sink.
Beautiful.  I'm really thankful to live here.</p>

<p>I realize that I'm acting exceptionally energetic and outgoing
partially to block some of the sadness that I feel as this is my
second to last event in the district.</p>

<p>When just relaxing listening to conversation or discussion, my legs
are both bouncing or or otherwise moving, nervous energy that I know
no other way to release.  I don't really feel safe enough to just lay
it all out, nor do I think this is really the right space to do
that.</p>

<p>Interesting.</p>

<p>Interesting that some people are drinking coffee to wake up.  I
don't really understand drinking coffee.  Bleah.</p>

<p>I have just learned something about myself.</p>

<p>After I told Steve that I want to climb the ceiling support in the
sanctuary, and he said, "you probably shouldn't do that," I wondered
about why I want to do it.</p>

<p>If I did it, I would write my name on the top of the bar where it
couldn't possibly be seen from the ground until someone takes the
sanctuary apart or also climbs up there.</p>

<p>I would even be willing to do it and <em>not</em> write my name up
there.</p>

<p>So why do I want to do it?  Fame?  No.  Defying rules?  No.</p>

<p>I just want the experience.  I want to have the memory of having
climbed to the top of the church sanctuary.</p>

<p>It would be so easy to do.  I've verified that I could reach the
rail sufficiently well by standing on the back of the pew to get up
there.  But that's not enough.  It's not enough to know I could do
it.  I want the experience of having done that.</p>

<p>That's why I climbed through the tube over Southwest Freeway in
Houston.</p>

<p>That's why I climbed under the girders of the bridge in Fort
Worth.</p>

<p>That's why I climbed the tree to the toppest branches that were
only 4 inches in diameter.</p>

<p>That's why I would time the traffic light and skate like a rocket
down the hill and sail across Allen Parkway.</p>

<p>That's why Eric and I waded through waist deep floodwaters on Allen
Parkway.</p>

<p>That's why I'm going to Japan, and why I'm going to learn
Japanese.</p>

<p>To collect the experience.  To have a story (so yes, that's a bit
of fame)..  but I don't go blab to everyone the stuff I've done.  I
write it and remember it and share the story when appropriate.  I
often discourage people from doing the same thing.</p>

<p>So that's what I learned about myself.  I like having experiences.
Not just reading about them.  Experiencing them.</p>
