<p>It's sprinkling a cold sprinklin' rain.  The field may be slippery for
bare feet like mine.  But we are here to have fun and play.</p>

<p>James is navigating as Adam drives. A Perfect Circle is on the CD
player.</p>

<p>So Molly, here is a question for you:  When did Sears / Robuck,
Montgomery Wards,  JC Penny start?  What about Levi Strauss?  We remember
that Levi sold blue jeans to California gold miners, and that Sears & Robuck
started as a catalog sales company.  (not selling catalogs, but selling
through catalogs.)</p>

<p>The discussion was started when I was surprised to see Montgomery Wards
going out of business.  "haven't they been around for a long ass time?"</p>

<p>In current events:  we have turned around only once while trying to find
these fields.</p>

<p class=date>9:33 am</p>

<p>We just arrived.  No longer raining, but totally overcast.</p>

<p>This field has little bitty rocks on them, 3 times the size of sand
grains.  The wind is about 12-15 miles per hour.  The temperature is "cold"
according to Sarah and Kat.  I'd say about 60 degrees or less.</p>

<p>And we just saw lightning and heard thunder about 15 seconds later.</p>

<p class=date>10:58 am</p>

<p>Score is 5 - 3 us, I think.   I was covering the thrower and got bonked
pretty hard in the nose.  No blood, but it hurts.</p>

<p>Vev just made a great long toss to Sean who caught it near the endzone.
He threw disc to Meek who was <em>almost</em> in bounds.  A lot of people
were all, "huh?"  "He's in!"  "He's out!" and some people started backing
away and Meek threw in to Sean for the clear point.</p>

<p>In the amount of time it took me to type that, we got another point.</p>

<p>Sean has never seen a keyboard for a palm pilot before.</p>

<p>Score is 6 - 3 us now.</p>

<p class=date>11:03 am</p>

<p>Now it's 6 - 4.</p>

<p>Crazy scary throw by Andy to Vev.  "We'll forgive you this time, only
cause Vev caught it!"  Then throw from Vev to Andy in the endzone for a
skirt to skirt point.</p>

<p>Halftime now.  McCleod is going to get a keyboard now that he's seen how
cool this one is.</p>

<p class=date>11:09 am</p>

<p>Turnover when James missed right near the endzone, but they threw it away
instead of a point.  We just turned it over and they turned it over.  James
has it and Adam caught an amazingly wild throw for a point.</p>

<p>8 - 4 us now.</p>

<p>Tiny bit of rain.  They are working it up the field to half way now.
Turnover sliding non catch.</p>

<p class=date>11:12 am</p>

<p>tony to Vev to over Sean's head.</p>

<p>They are 3/4 up the field.  Now they got a point.</p>

<p>8 - 5 us now.</p>

<p>Oliver says he wants to be sure I didn't write about the part where he
screwed it up in the endzone.</p>

<p>James to Cog to James and pick was called on Cog's throw.   James
retained the disk and stall count was called really fast when Andy had it at
the line.  Long throw for a point over Andy's head.  That dude was towering
tall over him.  Great try Andy!!</p>

<p class=date>11:23 am</p>

<p>I was in while we just scored two points.  I played defense and tony said
"good job on covering that guy; he got away from you on that fourth cut..
But if he can do that, let him.  :-)"</p>

<p>I was pleased with my defense.  Great D by Andy just now.  Vev has it
forehand to someone Adam to Vev turnover just near our endzone.  Good catch
by their guy just now.  They worked it down the field and just missed it
diving for the catch.  Mark to Adam to Mike M barely missed it.  Turn again
over their guy's back and a huck down the field for no point.  "Life is
short," calls McCleod from under his huge colorful umbrella, "huck!"</p>

<p class=date>11:27 am</p>

<p>I think the score is 10 - 5 us now.</p>

<p>They turned over near their endzone oooh great save by one of their guys
after we turned again.   HAMMER!!!</p>

<p>And Vev banged the shit into the offense and knocked the disc away.  Back
to their thrower.</p>

<p>Meek is on the thrower and they got two short tosses in for a point.</p>

<p>10 - 6 us.</p>

<p>Vev said "there is no way it was a foul."</p>

<p class=date>11:30 am</p>

<p>Score is 10 - 7 according to the sidelines here; I must have missed a
point.</p>

<p>We are still in the first game.  Vev is all groaning "dude this ground
hurts."</p>

<p>They are close to their zone and got a point.  10 - 8 now.</p>

<p class=date>11:33 am</p>

<p>Chadwick just burned past his defender for a point!</p>

<p>11-8 now</p>

<p>Andy thinks Mark just jinxed us.  Sean hollers "one more point! ... was
our motto last year."</p>

<p class=date>11:35 am</p>

<p>11 - 9 us.</p>

<p>I'm going in.</p>

<p class=date>11:42 am

<p>12 - 10 now</p>

<p>I had a great slide with green stripes on my sweatpants now.</p>

<p>Before I could even type "green", Mark W tossed to Mark L who caught our
winning point!</p>

<p>"Nobody noticed when I started sprinting.  I was scared no one would see
me.. But they totally ignored me and incurred the wrath."</p>

<p>Here is our poem to them.</p>

<p class=message>We played a team named Murch.
<br>Whose name could not b besmurched
<br>The lightning in the sky
<br>Past us on bye
<br>We hope u knok the next tÃªam from their pirch.</p>

<p>It is officially damn cold.</p>

<p>We are still watching the other teams play.  The Murch team who we beat
is gettin' whomped this game.</p>

<p>It's 7 - 3 with white team winning.</p>

<p>Oh, I forgot to mention that I bought a cool color changing disk. It's
translucent white at night and turns magenta in UV light.  Very cool.  Sean
thinks it's ugly; he likes the more traditional white disc.  Sean of course,
is unable to embrace new technology.</p>

<p>We are moving to our new field now.  Full size field on a football field
with much nicer grass on the side and dirt with some big rocks in the
middle.<p>

<p class=date>1:27 pm</p>

<p>1 point each team in our second game.  I received the disc on their
kickoff and quickly got it to Vev or Mark and it was zipped down to Kat for
a point.</p>

<p>Then I messed up a throw at their endzone and they got a point.</p>

<p>This point Sean threw to James for our 2nd point.  Chadwick made a great
defensive play and Sean made a great catch out of the grass.  Amazing.</p>

<p>It's 2 - 1 us.</p>

<p>Good D by Tony for a turnover, but we just turned again and now Mark
caught their throw and tossed to Vev, to Tony.. Adam slipped in the grass as
it was over his head.</p>

<p>Long throw to the endzone and it bounced out of their guy's hand and Bill
slapped the shit out of the disc knocking it out of bounds.</p>

<p>Vev handling to Adam who slid and missed it and now their guy slid on his
chest to miss it in their endzone.</p>

<p>Vev to Adam to Mark working it down to Adam to Tony 20 yards from our
zone.  I heard their guy at the 5 count and Tony called timeout.  They are
saying we come back in on 8 stall.</p>

<p class=date>1:35 pm</p>

<p>Kat just blanketed me so she can read as well.  "We gotta keep our
journalist warm!"</p>

<p>Time in.</p>

<p>Back to Mark to Vev to Tony to Bill hammer to Vev who barely missed it in
the endzone.   Good throw Bill.</p>

<p>A valiant effort.</p>

<p>Disc up and turnover to us.  Mark is on it to Vev to Sarah but Ollie took
Sarah out.  </p>

<p>They overthrew toward their endzone.</p>

<p>Bill amazing catch now to Vev.</p>

<p>Roland (their team) caught it.</p>

<p>Mark to Vev and too low in the endzone.</p>

<p>Our endzone their disk.</p>

<p>long throw caught.  (but shitty throw) Vev has it to Mark..  Adam almost
caught it but was trying to stay in bounds and missed.  Great try Adam!</p>

<p>Pick is called.</p>

<p>Disc is tunedover.  Adam has it to Ollie to Tony but missed barely.
Roland to their guy 1/2 way down.  Vev intercepted! Vev to Bill to Adam to
Tony to Ollie to Mark tall catch to Vev on the ground to Adam to Sarah long
catch for a point!! YAY SARAH!!!!!</p>

<p>3 to 1 us.</p>

<p class=date>1:40 pm</p>

<p>Kat and Sarah caught two of our three points.</p>

<p>They have it, McCleod is blocking and he's a good blocker.  they threw it
backwards.  James was covering both sides of the throw.   Now they threw it
away.   Equipment timeout for Mike M.  Steve has it to Tall Dave (El Mano)
to Andy to James for point 4.  Long perfect forehand too.</p>

<p>YAY JAMES!!</p>

<p>McCleod: "I'm done for the day."</p>

<p>(The throw from McCleod to Dave was unintentional.  People were amazed!
"Only McCleod could have seen that!"   (he didn't))</p>

<p>Nice roll kickoff by Jaems. long throw but they threw it away.</p>

<p class=date>1:44 pm</p>

<p>We have it on their endzone.  Mark has it.. to Andy to Mark to Andy to
Mike M now they are out of the endzone back to Andy to Mark to Kat to Mark
to Andy to Mike to Andy and Kat dove, missed it on the ground.   They
scored.</p>

<p>4 - 2 us.</p>

<p> Mark has it 1/2 field  long to Tony for a point!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>A single throw for a point.  Sean was down in the endzone too, but Tony
got it.</p>

<p>5 - 2 us.</p>

<p class=date>1:47 pm</p>

<p>Kat is saying she turned her ankle on that fall.</p>

<p>We kickoff to them 3/4 down center of the field.  Sean is on disk now
Tony  now I can't see.  They got a point.</p>

<p>5 - 3 us.</p>

<p>I'm going in.</p>

<p>7 - 3 us.  and I got the assist!  Andy scored one after I took a bonk on
Oliver and the ground catching Steve's toss.</p>

<p>I had caught from Ollie and Sarah had a good catch and then she tossed to
Mark.  Then Ollie to me all the way at the endzone but not in yet.  I was
well covered and couldn't see Ollie yelling that he was open, but I got it
to him somehow for 7th point.  Yay!!</p>

<p class=date>1:56 pm</p>

<p>Halftime now.</p>

<p class=date>2:00 pm</p>

<p>We kick to them.  they work it up, Kat says we have loose defense and
yup, they got a point.</p>

<p>Chadwick: "Kat!  Those are my pants!  I'll take them back....
Tony!!"</p>

<p>7 - 4 us.</p>

<p>James, to Mark W long long throw knocked away from Mark L.</p>

<p>They are on our endzone.  Mike is marking toss to turnover.  Mike blade
to Mark W but missed.  too far over.</p>

<p>Their disc our endzone Tony almost got the D and their toss hit the
ground.    Mark W caught James slow throw to Kim now to Mark sliding catch.
to...  hammer to Tony for a point!!!!!!</p.

<p>8 - 4 us.</p>

<p class=date>2:05 pm</p>

<p>We kick to them.  3/4 floating land on the far side of the field from us.
long long pull and they caught it.</p>

<p>8 - 5 us.</p>

<p>Kim is coughing pretty thoroughly off field here.  Dry hack cough of cold
air.</p>

<p>They kick to us.  out of bounds kickoff.  James picked it up.  They are
forcing home.  We are moving the disc downwind.  to Vev long throw Adam did
not catch it in the endzone.</p>

<p>They threw it out of bounds.</p>

<p>Sean has the dsc to... Steven to James amazing catch by James! lots of
bobbling including over the defender's head and it landed on James on the
ground behind the defender and he immediately hopped up and tossed it to Vev
for a point.</p>

<p>Without basking in the glory of the great catch, James jumped up and made
the point.  Great job!!</p>

<p>9 - 5 us.</p>

<p>Their tall guy had the catch way near the endzone but Vev blocked the
point.  Dave has it to Vev, to.. Mike to Vev long throw missed by someone
then Andy tipped it and El Mano almost shoelace caught it.</p>

<p>Vev jumped in and caught it at their endzone again to..   ugly hammer out
of bounds because of the wind.  Their guy was probably pretty high count on
the stall. </p>

<p>Dark has it. Not caught, but a foul is called.  They have it. .   worked
it down well for a point.</p>

<p> 9 - 6 us.</p>

<p>We dropped it and now they have it 3/4 on our side and Tony tipped it (I
think) then Sean threw it to Tony for a point!!</p>

<p>10 - 6 us.</p>

<p class=date>2:17 pm</p>

<p>We toss to them and they turned over.  Mark W to Mark L to Mark W...  so
close Mark L almost got a long catch.  They turned it over again.  Tony was
covering all of them.</p>

<p>Roland on their team is down holding his ankle.  Some stretching therapy
and I can see his grimace all the way across the field.</p>

<p>Cog is sitting down too.</p>

<p>Now they have two men helping Roland off the field.  (clap clap clap clap
clap politely from the sidelines)</p>

<p>Their disc and long throw way out of bounds.</p>

<p class=date>2:21 pm</p>

<p>Our disc on their endzone.  We are going upwind.</p>

<p>Andy to Mark W to Andy to Sarah to Mark L to Tony bad throw into the wind
and turnover.   They got it down there for a point.</p>

<p>10 - 7 us.</p>

<p>They are kicking off to us.</p>

<p>Kat traded me a nutrigrain bar for some of my body heat.</p>

<p>Vev to Mark W to Sean to Vev looong throw to Bill who caught it barely
within the corner, burning his defender!</p>

<p>Bill did a great move reading the play on that one.</p>

<p>11 - 7 us.</p>

<p>Meek:  "Nobody can deny, I was a 'guy on field.'"</p>

<p>Our throw rolled out of bounds  Great D by James!!!!</p>

<p>They contested it was a foul. and another great D by James in the
endzone!  This tiime without knocking anyone down.  James' throw got
blocked.</p>

<p>They are taking time to set up at their endzone and they caught it over
Adam's head.</p>

<p>11 - 8 us.</p>

<p>I'm going in.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>

<p>I tossed a long perfect throw which Mark L's running trajectory was
perfectly in line for the point!</p>

<p>Then I lost my defender and they got a point. </p>

<p>12 - 9 us.</p>

<p>Before I could write "trajectory," Sean caught the winning point from
Andy!  "I was looking at him and he was looking at me, and I didn't know if
he could make the throw..." explains Sean.</p>

<p>We won game two 13 to 9.</p>

<p>Sneaky:  We already had written a cheer before the game even started.
It's being editted now.   "Where is the fish reference?"   "I don't think it
has enough lines to be a limerick."</p>

<p class=message>We played a team hard to beat
<br>time and time a score they'd repeat
<br>Irish we're not
<br>Luck we ain't got
<br>We played a great game 'gainst reheat.</p>

<p>Their song to us:
<br>Doh! the disc, I dropped the disc
<br>Ray, the sun got in my eyes
<br>Me, the one who dropped the disc
<br>Fa, a long long way to run
<br>So, I think I'll have a beer
<br>La, I'll have another beer
<br>Tea, no thanks I'll have a beer
<br>Which brings us back to Doh doh Doh!</p>

<p>We get to stay on this same field for our next game.</p>

<p class=date>2:58 pm</p>

<p>We just changed to dark, or actually multi-color hurl shirts.  Most of us
have hurl shirts.</p>

<p class=date>3:10 pm</p>

<p>They are winning 3 to 0.</p>

<p>LOOONNGGG beautiful throw by Mark W to Sean for a point!</p>

<p>They are up 3 to 1.</p>

<p>Our kick off and immediate drop and Cog's throw got blocked.  They got a
point.</p>

<p class=date>3:12 pm</p>

<p>4 to 1 them.</p>

<p>Long throw by Mark W to Tony for a point!</p>

<p class=date>3:14 pm</p>

<p>4 to 2 them.</p>

<p>Periwinkle, royal blue, red, purple, forest green, light purple, and
light blue are the shirt colors on our current team lineup.  No player with
the same color shirt!</p>

<p>They didn't make the point, but close.</p>

<p>They scored.</p>

<p>5 to 2 them.</p>

<p>Sean soccer blocked their kickoff.  Mike to Vev overthrew to Mark W in
the endzone.</p>

<p>GREAT D BY Mark W!</p>

<p>Vev to Adam cross field for a point!</p>

<p class=date>3:18 pm</p>

<p>5 - 3 them.</p>

<p>Our kick to them by  Vev .</p>

<p>Long throw for their point.</p>

<p>6 - 3 them 3:19 pm</p>

<p>I'm going in.

<p>7 - 3 now.  We have to move our field cause the football players are
going to use it.</p>

<p class=date>3:27 pm</p>

<p>"Why don't we just call it a tie and get a beer?"</p>

<p>This new field is way small.</p>

<p>We are going to let the other team finish their game and then move to
their field.  The good field!</p>

<p>"Let's just play hotbox!"</p>

<p>Five on five players?</p>

<p>"Everyone play on their knees!"</p>

<p>"3 legged players!  Seven people on each team and two pairs play three
legged."</p>

<p class=date>3:33 pm</p>

<p>middle of game three, but no suitable field.  We are just chillin'.</p>

<p class=date>3:36 pm</p>

<p>The sun!!!!   The sun!!!  oh wait it's gone.</p>

<p class=date>3:49 pm</p>

<p>Still chillin'.  Kat and Sarah are chilliin' under the pooh bear blanket
on one of the collapsable chairs.  Vev was chillin' on them for a
second.</p>

<p class=date>3:50 pm</p>

<p>We are going to move to a nearby park.</p>

<p>Schlepp Schlepp Schlepp</p>

<p class=date>4:10 pm<p>

<p>Meek:  "Anarchy reigns."</p>

<p>Tall Dave: "but we got our uplink established so we're alright."</p>

<p>This field is much grassier but there are craggly oak trees around the
field and one right in the middle.</p>

<p>Now the field has been squeezed in between the trees on the rolling ocean
of small hills.</p>

<p class=date>4:21 pm</p>

<p>9 to 4 them now.  I was in for the first two points.  I didn't do too
much damage to their offense.   Andy just scored a point!!!</p>

<p>9 to 5 them.</p>

<p class=date>4:24 pm</p>

<p>10 to 5 them.</p>

<p>Kim:  "Vev, where is your skirt?  Oh my gosh, how do you fit all that
under your pants?"</p>

<p>This field is wavy like an ocean of grass.</p>

<p class=date>4:25 pm</p>

<p>10 to 6 them.  Cog just made a lovely catch in the endzone and then
executed a gratuitous dive in the grass.</p>

<p>GREAT D by Mark W and Steven ran away from our toss and it was turned
over for them to get a quick point.</p>

<p>11 to 6 them.</p>

<p>Mark W long pass to Mike M, but he didn't get it.</p>

<p>Long throw to them and a score for them but it was contested almost by
Mark L.  Vev just got a point.</p>

<p>Weird.  I think my 11 to 6 must not have been a point.. they are saying
it's 11 - 7 now.</p>

<p class=date>4:30 pm</p>

<p>Their disc and missed.  Tony to Sean to Vev diving catch by Adam after
Meek knocked it way up in the air and Adam tossed to Meek for a point!!!!
Hell of a save Adam!!</p>

<p>4:32 pm</p>

<p>11 - 8 them now.</p>

<p>kickoff to the endzone and they missed the catch.  Vev perfect forehand
to Ollie for a point!!!</p>

<p class=date>4:32 pm</p>

<p>Meek says this team kicked our ass twice, but it's 11 - 9 now.</p>

<p>"One more point," chanted quietly by Bill who says the cones are crooked.
Kat patronizes him.  Line fault is called way back there.</p>

<p>Sean excellent D in the endzone.</p>

<p>Mark W to ..  turnover.</p>

<p>Their point.  12 - 9 now.</p>

<p>I'm in.  Nope they don't need my help.</p>

<p class=date>4:36 pm</p>

<p>They barely missed it after a turnover.</p>

<p>Mark W long bomb to tony but knocked away and Tony is down in the
endzone.   Need a sub.  Sean is in.</p>

<p>Scoober to their guy and turnover.  Adam to Vev who hit the ground on the
ditch in the field.  to Mark W to Adam to Steven to Sean for a point!!</p>

<p class=date>4:38 pm</p>

<p>12 to 10 them</p>

<p>Vev: "That divot sucked."</p>

<p class=date>4:39 pm</p>

<p>Mark W kickoff to them into the endzone.  They are working it up and back
and Ollie almost got the D.  but they got the point.  They won 13 to 10.</p>

<p>Fuck the cheer we'll buy you a beer, we gotta go"  was their cheer to
us.</p>

<p>The Centex competition is tomorrow, and the
leaders/organizers got a big change in plans:</p>

<pre>
To:  Houston Ultimate
<HoustonUltimate@yahoogroups.com>
Date:  15 Mar 2001 15:25:26 CST
Subject:  [HoustonUltimate] centex field change


Sorry if this is a repost, but apparently we're not at
the Intramural fields and not at the backup for that. 
Instead it's somewhere else...


===============================================
CENTEX captains,

Just as we were confirming all Centex details, we
received some bad news from the folks at the Pickle
tournament site. They were planning their tasks for
our tournament, and when they scheduled the mowing of
the fields they realized that not only could they not
mow some of the fields, but that we can't play on some
of the fields. Why not? Bluebonnets.

OK, I admit this is funny. I'd be laughing much harder
if I hadn't just spent my spring break scrambling
around for fields. In any case, Bluebonnets are as
sacred to Texas as football (well, OK, not that
sacred) but since Pickle shelled out $400/lb. for
Bluebonnet seed and bothered to plant them and it
looks  pretty nice, they've taken away more than half
our fields. We're down from 16 fields (we were hoping
to squeeze in a 17th somewhere) down to 6 fields out
at Pickle.

So, it turns out we need your help. Here's how it is
going to work:

SITES:
The Open Divisions and the Women's division are going
to be moved to alternate sites. Open A and Open B are
going to play at LBJ High School, and Women are going
to play at Reagan High School. (College will stay on
the 6 fields at Pickle.) The fieldspace at each of
these sites should be adequate to support the number
of teams that registered in each division. Food, water
and Centex discs will be available at all three
locations, and we are working on getting Port-a-Johns
at the alternate sites.

CAPTAINS MEETINGS: We will now be holding three
separate captain's meetings, one at each site. You
MUST be at the site for your division at 9:30 so the
coordinator can fill you in on any Saturday game-time
changes and update you with times/locations for Sunday
playoffs.

Maps to all three competition sites are now available
on the website, along with driving directions:
<a
href="https://www.austin-ultimate.org/centex/maps.html">https://www.austin-ultimate.org/centex/maps.html</a>

Please get the word out to your teams as quickly as
possible so that we can avoid having a slew of lost
ultimate players stopping to smell the bluebonnets at
Pickle on Saturday morning.

Thanks,
-bogo and maria

<p>We have just arrived at The Comfort Suites Hotel, but the place is under
construction.  Oh shit.  wrong hotel!  hahhahaa</p>

<p class=date>10:37 pm 16-3-01</p>

<p>We made it to our correct (built) hotel and now we're at IHOP to munch;
Dave just arrived, saying that they went to Texas Land and Cattle, but ...
it was still under construction.  Muwhahaha!!</p>

<p>Andy:</p>

<p class=message>Wonder has just made a huge mistake.  He handed me his
Visor.  Now I will destroy his life by making up stories in his journal and
then emailing them to the world.  Bwuuahahaha!</p>

<p>Tamara is too tired to type:</p>

<p class=message>but I am ready to KICK ASS maÃ±ana as soon as I get a little
bit of grub in my tum-tum.</p>

<p>Andy asked, "is this a public website?"</p>

<p class=date>11:46 pm 16-3-01</p>

<p>Wow!  We played silent Football at dinner tonight!  They (Tamara, Steven,
Andy, Mark) really enjoyed the game for a few rounds.  Mostly Andy tattled
on Tamara.  Steven tattled on Tamara and Andy a couple of times.  Tamara
just tried to defend Tamara's self.  Great fun!!</p>

<p>We are back at the hotel now and might go swimming or chilling in the hot
tub.  We are supposed to be awake and on the field in 9.5 hours, so I've got
time to go swim and chill.  I'll do that whether or not anyone else does.

<p class=date>1:04 am 17-3-01</p>

<p>Pool was big fun.  We got a picture of the color-changing light between
Andy's legs, and I started a whirlpool in the big pool!!  It was really
amazing.  Actually I should be clear-- it was my idea and I <em>started</em>
the whirlpool, and Mark and Tamara really helped me get it going to an
impressive rotational velocity.  easily 2 feet per second along the side.
The pool was between 3.5 and 5.5 feet deep, about 15 feet wide and 25 feet
long.  Lots of gallons of water running around there!  Shape of a rectangle
with rounded corners.</p>

<p>We talked ultimate gossip and random stuff.  Now it's time for
sleeeep.</p>

<p>I'm going to leave my Visor open beside my bed in case inspirational
typing strikes tonight.</p>

<p>Today at work, um, oh I exported some datasets  to .xls files for some of
our clients to see.  Very fun, not really.</p>

<p>Oh, I made a major cool modification  to my G3 project - now all the
project modules that it uses are specified in a dataset so they can be
changed easily.  (I can't see as I'm typing).  So I successfully got that
working and it should make the project WAY cooler.  This is a chage that I
intended for version 2 of the project.  I added it now becuse they were all
indicating that two different clients will need significantly different
reports.  If I can specify dynamically which module to run, then *bing*
magically different reports per project.</p>

<p>Now we are in Adam's 4Runner on the way to Austin for Centex Ultimate
frisbee tournament. In the truck are Adam, Tall Dave, Mark W and me.</p>

<p class=date>8:14 pm</p>

<p>I'm practically falling asleep.  We he been essentially silent in the car
for 30 minutes.  Radio has been rockin' thought.</p>

<p class=date>8:20 pm</p>

<p>Oh here is an interesting-ish story.  Wende made lunch again for me
today, but I forgot to take it to work.  Therefore, I took it with me to
meet the carpooling group at Andy's house.  Tuna Noodle and grapes and a
cookie.  I forgot a fork though, so I ate it with my fingers on the way to
Andy's house.  Got there way earlier than I expected, so I stopped by Kroger
and and bought 3 gallons of water for eighty five cents each.  Much better
than getting 3 liters of water for 99 cents each.</p>

<p>While in Kroger, Wende called my cell phone to say "Louisiana 900"
because she had just seen a Louisiana license plate that ended with 900.
It's a game we play.  The person who sees the out-of-state plate first, gets
the number of points as the last digit of the license plate.  If the last
digit is a zero, then they get 10 times the next to last digit.  If it's
also a zero, they get 100 times what the 3rd to last digit it, and so on.
900 is a pretty good find.    If it's a letter zero zero, like L00 then that
is 1200 points.  Very nice indeed.</p>

<p>I arrived at Andy's apartment while Andy was pulling some stuff out of
his car.  Tall Dave and Tamara arrived within 2 minutes later.  We all hung
out upstairs until everyone arrived:  James (was already there), me, Tamara,
Tall Dave, Kim, Steven, Adam, and Mark.  I think that's it.</p>

<p>Stopped at the gas stations at Jones Road and 290.  Adam went to the
Exxon side because he gets 10 percent off.  I acted as a courier across the
street purchasing some cough drops for Kim.  She asked for a bag of 30 honey
flavor, but they only had menthol and cherry flavor.  I was able to get her
29 - a box of 20 and a roll of 9.   Close.</p>

<p class=date>8:25 pm</p>

<p>we just stopped at the pristine gas station outside Giddings.</p>

<p class=date>7:42am CST Thursday 15 March 2001</p>
<p class=note>(dream)</p></p>

<p class=dream>Standing behind a cement mixer, I pulled on the lever
to dump out the concrete, but it wasn't full enough to dump out.  The
concrete was being mixed as if in the back of a pickup truck - out in
the open in the bed of the truck.  I asked a Mexican (*) guy beside
me, "um, como se dice 'concrete'?" ("um, how do you say concrete?")</p>

<p class=dream>He told me some weird name that was like cielo de
something, but I couldn't understand him over the noise of the mixer.
The truck started to pull away and I grabbed on, allowing myself to
"surf" backwards behind it.  The Mexican guy and his son ran after the
truck for a bit, but never caught up.  They walked away.  I was sad,
but realized I will meet more people who can help me learn
Spanish.</p>

<p class=dream>I rode in the back of the cement mixer for a long time,
and actually fell asleep during my ride and found a high school youth
on either side of me when I woke up.  They were actually sitting in
the cement, while I was still surfing backwards, not wanting to get
concrete on my shorts.  They were much more experienced at this kind
of hitching a ride.</p>

<p class=dream>We stopped and I fell asleep again and we were still
stopped when I woke up.  The youth were like, "we're at a light."  I
looked around the side of the truck, careful to not let anyone see me,
and I could see we were at a railroad crossing.</p>

<p class=dream>I got nervous and quietly crab-walked back away from
the truck in the grassy ditch beside the road.  As I backed away, two
men came to the back of the truck and apprehended the youth for
illegally hitching a ride.  One of the men saw me and came walking
toward me.  I looked behind me and saw there was no sneaky place to
run and hide.  I was caught.</p>

<p class=dream>I told him I would come peacefully as he tried to grip
my hand really hard and it was hurting my fingers.  He let go of my
hand and I just walked behind him, claiming ignorance of my
wrongdoings, "We didn't ride on the train at all!"</p>

<p class=dream>The railroad track was exactly that - a circular track
for trains.  We could only see a small part of the curve - the loop
must have been a few hundred yards in diameter.  A few trains were
moving along it.</p>

<p class=dream>"Can you catch that train?" he asked, indicating a
single engine that was headed toward us.</p>

<p class=dream>It was going too quickly for me to catch, plus I didn't
try too hard to catch it, faking that I couldn't possibly know how to
run and catch a train. (**)</p>

<p class=dream>He indicated another that I should try to catch, but
again it was going too fast.</p>

<p class=dream>Then I saw there were cars, automobiles on the tracks.
A small sedan and a small pickup and a small other car.  The first
sedan slowed suddenly, and the pickup crashed into the back up it, and
the next car crashed, jumped over the first two in a tumbling stunt
movie kinda way.  I ran backwards from the destruction, yelling, "I'll
come back if it's safe!"</p>

<p class=dream>The man who had pulled me to the tracks was still just
standing there, unphased by the wreckage.  People had just been hurt
or killed; that accident wasn't faked.  He was trying to teach me how
dangerous it was to mess around with trains and traffic and such.  I
was totally scared.</p>

<p class=dream>"What kind of crazy job do you have?" I pleaded, trying
to smooth talk my way out of whatever trouble I seemed to be in,
thinking maybe if I get to know him, he'll let me go.</p>

<p class=dream>Then I snuck away by waking up.</p>

<p>(*) From my spanish class, I understand Mexicans, or any
individuals from central or south america prefer to be called Mexians,
or whatever country they're from-ians, not "hispanics."</p>

<p>(**) When I was 8-15 years old, we lived with railroad tracks
behind the house.  I jumped on quite a few trains in that time.
Usually they were going quite slowly and it was all no sweat.  There
were times however, that the train would be accelerating while we were
on it, and it got scarier and scarier to jump off, and more scary the
longer we waited to get the nerve to jump off!</p>

<p>After work I visited Amy at the Mad Potter after
Wende had just been there and said Amy asked about me.
 Fun to see her again, and I got the update on her
life.  She's currently interested in Business or Hotel
and Restaurant Management at UH.  Just core classes so
far though.</p>

<p>At the Mad Potter, they are doing a monthly pottery
contest.  I asked about entering the plate that I
spent 38 hours on last year, but apparently it's
supposed to be only for pieces fired in the last
month.  Hmmm.</p>

<p>This is a <em>very</em> sneaky way to get me to
paint another plate!</p>
