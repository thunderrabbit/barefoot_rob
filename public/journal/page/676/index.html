Last night Wende and I went to CiCi&rsquo;s Pizza, and invited our youth group to join just for fun.  Laura was there promptly at 7.  We talked about school and her trips to Disney World and stuff.  Actually Wende had more to say than I; I&rsquo;ve never been to Disney World.  <em>sniff!</em>
<p>
I encouraged Laura to get involved with Houston Rally planning, telling her how awesome the experience has been for many youth.
<p>
Today I have finally gotten caught up with my journal entries.

                        <p class=date>14 October 1997</p>

<p>Tonight I just got back from my latest Wild Skating Adventure.  I
had been reading a cool channeled book called _The Pleiadian Agenda_
by Barbara Hand Clow.  I read something like, "go out into your world
and experience fully living your life" and I thought, I'm gonna go
skating!</p>

<p>I sat out on our back porch and put on my two pairs of socks, wrist
guards, knee pads, skates and helmet.  I had on my absolutely favorite
NO FEAR shirt that has been ripped and sewn significantly on the back.
It has numerous holes from numerous washings, and grease and grime
from when I recently cleaned my bearings and got new wheels.</p>

<p>All suited up, I clunked outside, looked up and saw the moon
just above the trees, beautifully full.  Perfect.  I felt inspired to
give thanks and welcome the positive gods from all four directions, so
I prayed a little prayer toward each direction, inviting them to join
me and enjoy my skate.</p>

<p>Starting from my apartment in Houston, I skated toward downtown,
using a Dallas Street until I got to Taft.  Turning left on Taft, I
get to accelerate down the slight hill toward Allen Parkway.  The
light was green as I was a bit too high up the hill to make it, so I
slowed down a little, watching the cars on the left as they waited for
their green light.  It didn't come; instead the cars from the right
turning left onto Taft got the green light, so I hadn't needed to slow
down after all.  Dangit!  I coulda blasted through the
intersection!</p>

<p>I still went through pretty fast, past all the waiting cars, up the
curb onto the median, waiting for the oncoming cars to pass (they
never have to stop as it's a T intersection) and then zip(!) right
across Allen Parkway to the wide sidewalk waiting for me.</p>

<p>The night had grown fairly dark despite the full moon and clear sky,
so it was a fun challenge to navigate the bumpy part of the sidewalk
as it meanders around a field and a weird globby metal art thing.
Past a popular place to park at night, the sidewalk becomes much
smoother; by the time I pass under Interstate 45, just north of where
it becomes The Pierce Elevated, I'm zipping down a smooth asphalt
sidewalk toward a street that merges with Allen Parkway and only has a
yield sign to slow its traffic.</p>

<p>Fortunately, few cars use this street at night, so I rarely have to
contend with them.  Tonight, however, I see the headlights of a lone
car zipping up the hill to meet Allen Parkway.  The driver apparently
doesn't notice me, and I'm glad because most drivers slow down under
such circumstances, which throws of my timing.  The car hardly yields
and zips across my sidewalk about 2 seconds before I zip across its
street.  Perfect timing.</p>

<p>Up along Sam Houston Park (I think that's what it's called) I skate to
Brazos Street and then turn in toward downtown at the public library.
I skate a few blocks then turn left on Louisiana Street toward my first
destination: Jones Plaza.</p>

<p>It turns out I'm right within a pack of cars, which all cluster as the
synchronized green lights let them traverse the city.  I'm a bit
winded, but I know there will hardly be a better opportunity for some
car surfing!</p>

<p>I push hard to stay with the pack for the two blocks until the hill
that goes down beside Jones Plaza.  Cars have slowed down to turn left
just before the plaza, so I zip along the striped line just to their
right.  Once they turn, I slide over to the left-most lane, flying
past cars parked along the curb.  I'm quickly approaching from behind
a pickup truck driving not quite as fast as I, so I squeeze between it
and the parked cars, passing it before I zing across the next
intersection.  It's all uphill from here, so I slow down and turn left
onto the sidewalk near Birraporetti's, glancing in at the well dressed
diners, wondering at the difference in our present lives.</p>

<p>Into the exit of the drive-through valet parking area at the Alley
Theater, and pick up some speed as I careen toward the next street.
This one usually proves exciting as the driveway curves right toward
oncoming traffic.  (It is, of course, actually an entrance ramp)
Fortunately, there is usually little traffic on this particular street
at this time of night.  I make a wide sweeping left turn and hop up
onto the sidewalk of Jones Plaza, breeze past the Port-A-Potties,
clunk up the two sets of about six steps each, then sit heavily on the
concrete wall, heart still totally thumping hard and I just sit there
to recover.</p>

<p>Crowds of people are crowded around the stage, where the band is
happily tossing out dance tunes for all to enjoy. </p>

<p>I rested for a while, then went back up the street to do it all
again!  I saw that one of the lights on Louisiana Street was out of
synch with the others; this is what had caused the cars to get all
crowded together.  Yay!  I didn't get into quite as much traffic as I
wanted this time, though; I actually was a bit ahead of it, so the
excitement level just wasn't quite there as before.  Still I zip
across the street at the bottom of the hill, then around the
Birraporetti's corner.  Mostly it's still all the same people in
there.</p>

<p>After resting on my wall again, I wondered if Wende might still be at
work at University of Houston Downtown; she was when I left the
apartment and didn't know how much longer until she got to leave.  I
skated purposely toward 1 Main Street, at the top of the hill over
Buffalo Bayou.  Students were still there, mostly talking and/or
waiting for the bus to take them home.  I skated inside but didn't see
her in the bookstore.  I clunked down the steps and knocked on the
door, but they didn't seem to be there.  So I got a drink of water,
came back, and just as I was about to leave, they came down the
stairs!  I gave Wende and hug and smooch, and she asked if I would
wanna skate down the parking garage!  At first I was all, Nah, then
Sure! Why the heck not??</p>

<p>They got a head start, so I went down the up-ramp and got myself in
front of them.  I led the way down the garage, waiting for them to
catch up so they could see me zippin' down the ramps.  At the parking
garage exit I skated clunky bump over the speed bumps and under the
garage arm.  The arms raised for them, so they drove beside it as we
waved b-bye.</p>

<p>I skated toward the driveway/street thing that leads back up to the
Main Street hill.</p>

<p>Not entirely gracefully, I stepped up a couple steps to the
sidewalk leading up the hill.  I pushed my way up the hill and rested
at the top for a minute before making my ultra fast flight toward the
light at the bottom.  The light turned red, so I started counting off
ten seconds.  A cop car drove past, so I aborted the mission; I don't
know if it's entirely good form to speed through an intersection on
skates while passing a cop.  I'm a wuss I know..</p>

<p>I waited for the next light cycle to pass.  It turned red and I
counted ten seconds; there were no cars coming over the top of the
hill, so I started pushing hard down the hill toward the red light.
As I'm at full speed halfway down the hill, the light turns green,
allowing the cars to get a head start.  A few seconds later, I'm
passing them on the right hand side, squeezing in between the traffic
and parked cars.  Total exhilaration as I turn right at the next
intersection, and push push push down the hill again.  I love the
timing of the lights; this next one turns green for me and I careen
toward a construction area right in front of The Brewery Tap.  The
road is entirely blocked off, so I planned to turn left into a bank
parking area, but I notice a chain blocking it off.  I'm not sure that
I can jump over the chain, so I adjust toward the right to a dark area
of sidewalk and hope to there's nothing blocking the way.  Only a
couple of bumps and a bit of a slope, which I navigate easily.  Whew!
Yes!</p>

<p>I was totally winded, and paused for a bit at the next corner.
Then down to Louisiana Street where I skate along the sidewalk back up
to Jones Plaza.  I sat on my wall again listening to my body to see if
I wanted to surf the cars back down the hill again.  Of course I did!
Once I felt recovered, I skated down the two sets of six steps and up
the street to wait for the next pack of cars.</p>

<p>This time I waited for most of the pack to get past me before I
started to catch them.  The wind seemed to really blow against me,
making it hard to keep up with the traffic.  Across the intersection I
went, this time in the middle lane, as there were two lanes of cars
all cramped up at the intersection.  I stayed in the middle lane down
the hill past Jones Plaza, and was awarded a little [beep beep] from a
Honda as I passed them.  I signaled my intention to shift over to the
left lane, looked back over my shoulder to verify it was clear and
then angled over to Birraporetti's sidewalk again.  This time very few
people were eating in there..</p>

<p>I turned around instead of going through the drive-through valet
parking tunnel and eased down the sidewalk to the Plaza again.  Once I
got to my recovery wall, there were a couple of cop cars with lights
dancing around, and a couple of officers on horses.  I don't know what
was the excitement, but I wondered how wise it would be to car surf
past them.  Their attention was focused away from my street, so I
figured it should be no problem.  One last time tonight and then I'm
going home.</p>

<p>I waited for the pack of cars to go past and then I took off after
them.  Traffic seemed much lighter this time; I skated down the hill
and heard no honks, nor did I have to squeeze between traffic and
parked cars.  I don't even think any of the cops noticed me.</p>

<p>Good thing; I wanted to go home anyway.  I headed back up
Louisiana, keeping to the sidewalks and to myself.  I skated slowly
down Dallas Street back toward Montrose, practicing long gliding
strokes which are more efficient, but use way different muscles than
I'm used to using.  I'll have to practice them more.</p>

<p>Got home just in time to say HI to Wende just before she left to go
work out.</p>

                        <p class=date>12 October 1997</p>

<p><p>
This weekend at Austin was really super productive and super fun.
<p>
I picked up Jason F in a rental car at about 6:45pm Friday.  He
practically bounced out the front door, goin&rsquo; &ldquo;West Side Prepatory!
Come Again!&rdquo; The craziness had begun. He was wearing nothing but a
towel around his waist, as he had just taken a shower, making the
scene much funny.
<p>
We stopped by a gas station to get food. As soon as I parked the car,
Jason jacked the keys out of the ignition, since I didn&rsquo;t let him
drive. I got a a bar-b-cue sandwich, a king sized KitKat, and two
12-ounces of Surge. Jason got beef jerky and something else and a
beverage. Always Surge and KitKat for me a beef jerky for Jason.
<p>
Jason ran outside so he could drive.  To get the keys back, I simply
told him I wouldn&rsquo;t get in the car, and pointed out that he didn&rsquo;t
know how to get to Austin.
<p>
On the way to Austin, mostly Jason told me all kindsa crazy
experiences he&rsquo;s experienced. Ask him for details.
<p>
I apparently didn&rsquo;t know how to get to the church in Austin, and we
drove up and down most of 35 twice to find Koenig.  Turns out we
weren&rsquo;t far enough north and I had heard that Airport intersected
Koenig, so I just took Airport.
<p>
Got to the church around 11:30pm and Jon D and JoEllen W were the
adults still there waiting for an adult on YAC to arrive. I could not
fuckin&rsquo; believe it that they hadn&rsquo;t just given the keys to Jeremy or
Tia!!!!
<p>
As soon as I got they keys and they left, I gave them to Jeremy.  I
didn&rsquo;t want to be in charge of the keys!
<p>
We drove to Taco Cabana to get some food and then munched and talked
back at the church until Arlene D and Aaron I arrived.
<p>
We played and played the first night.  Jason and Jeremy walked to the
Blockbuster about 3 blocks away to get a movie (it was closed since it
was 1am) so we just stayed up playin&rsquo; hackey sack and I don&rsquo;t even
remember what else, except the funniest thing I remember from that
night was when Jason, Austin, Jeremy, Tia all dog piled onto Aaron,
shouting &ldquo;crush Aaron&rsquo;s dude!&rdquo;  &ldquo;Crush his dude!&rdquo; That was hilarious.
<p>
I think we just hung out and talked and played all night until I went
to bed about 3am and the boys were all still playing roudily until
like 4am.  Crazy fun.
<p>
8am we woke up at the insistence of my beeper alarm and cleaned up the
room we had trashed and got prepared for the meeting.  Tia had woken
up at 7am to take a shower and get bagels, Jason, Aaron and I played
hackey sack, and next thing we know the meeting is ready to start.
<p>
The meeting lasted from 9 to 4. (we did have a couple breaks)
<p>
Basically we redesigned District YAC: 8 youth serving 1 year terms; 2
youth-elected advisors to serve 2-year terms, staggered by a year to
help continuity; 1 board appointed adult and 1 RE board appointed
adult, each to serve 2 year staggered terms.
<p>
Then we went through the bylaws and fixed some of the wording and
redesigned some portions of them.
<p>
We plan to present the new bylaws to the YRUU at San Antonio Rally,
October 31 weekend, then the board will vote on them at their meeting
in November, and then it should be all good and we&rsquo;ll have new bylaws
that put YAC on the district map.  YAC will be fully recognized by the
adult congregation and so youth empowerment will not be empowerment in
a vacuum, as Jon D described the present state of the District YAC.
<p>
The meeting was all good.
<p>
At about 5 or 5:30 in the pm, several of us decided to go shopping in
Austin. The first place we went was a leather, latex and bondage shop;
I don&rsquo;t remember the name. I got a blindfold, and the youth were all
like, Woah, Rob.. and I said, It&rsquo;s for a haunted house.  They
were all Suurrre..  good story Rob.  I said Thanks!
<p>
The we went to a place called Bohemian Boutique (I think). They sold a
bunch of old-ass clothing and vinyl and masks and furniture and
eye glasses and everything.  I got a groovy round pillow with circles
quilted onto one side of it.  I&rsquo;ll use it for meditation and other
sitting activities.
<p>
Then to the strip we went to shop for CDs.  (Oh- did I tell you it was
raining all day?  It was raining all day.  Always more than just a
sprinkle, and sometimes fairly hard.)  We finally found a parking
space and went first to Technophilia, a small CD shop crowded with
discs and people. I spent a great deal of time talking with the owner
about various CD stuff, and told him my CD purchases were at an all
time low as I am getting ready for my trip in August. We talked about
the importance of exploration during life and following one&rsquo;s dream.
Pretty cool guy; I got his email and URL <a href=https://www.technophilia.com>www.technophilia.com</a>
<p>
Then to Tower Records, huge two story ceiling, rows and rows of
popular CDs and then some oldies and techno and imports.  I just
failed to be impressed with the commercialism of the whole thing so I
went back to Technophilia for several minutes.  Then back to Tower,
where the youth were pretty much ready to move on to the next store,
although they were busily checkin&rsquo; out the magazines and when I
approached, were all, &ldquo;Rob! check out this book!&rdquo;  and handed me
<em>Naked in New York</em>, hundreds of pictures of people simply standing
fully dressed, and then standing fully naked in the next picture.
Hmmm. They explained, &ldquo;that way when you see someone, you can guess
what they look like without clothes on.&rdquo;  Makes sense to me.
<p>
Back to the front desk I went and (holy shit!) there&rsquo;s Mike O from
back in my old YRUU days 10 years ago!  He went to my church and we&rsquo;ve
been simply encountering one another off and on forever since.  Crazy!
<p>
By that time, I was pretty much CDed out, (the truth is I was having a
harder and harder time not purchasing (good thing I didn&rsquo;t have cash
on me (it&rsquo;s not entirely good form (I assume) to borrow excessive cash
from your youth))) so when Jason and I walked to one last store
(remember it was still raining (I was happily barefoot)), I just kinda
poked around a tiny bit and contemplated each poster for its artistic
merit and statement it tried to make, while he browsed through the
crusty punk selections and made another purchase.
<p>
Then we walked across the street to Dobie Mall (I did a cartwheel
across the street) and found another CD store!  We couldn&rsquo;t resist and
quickly went in to look through a bit; I asked the guy if he had any
CDs by Thorn.  He did, but I had the album he had and didn&rsquo;t really
want a single off that album.  Jason and I looked through all the
posters.  I almost got one of two different Tori Amos posters (I had
almost purchased <em>Somewhere Over the Rainbow</em>, a Tori Amos concert
recording CD) but was able to resist again.  I wondered at the oddity
of people collecting posters.  Why do we like them?
<p>
Jason and I found the rest of the group finishing their food.  They
had gone to eat while we had gone to what turned out to be the second
to last CD store. Tia had some great cookies, so I went over and
purchased a couple.  I can resist CDs, but apparently not sugar.
<p>
By that time it was gettin&rsquo; to be like 9:30 so we headed back toward
the vehicles. We splashed through the rain and puddles silly talkin&rsquo;
and playful banter back toward the cars.  Melissa Jeremy and I went to
the rental car and Melissa really wanted ice cream (the ice cream she
had gotten at the food court place was grainy and gross) so we went to
Amy&rsquo;s!  The guys behind the counter were really funny, especially when
one guy tossed two scoops of ice cream behind his back and missed, so
the other guy started to juggle them with one hand and he was like,
C&rsquo;mon one more!  Let me juggle them!
<p>
So crackin&rsquo; up silly fun!  I didn&rsquo;t want to get anything until I saw
they had Surge as a beverage choice.  So I got a &ldquo;frosted&rdquo; which is
like an ice cream float except it&rsquo;s blended. I got Blueberry Crunch
ice cream and Surge.  It wasn&rsquo;t super amazing delightfully tasteful,
but I enjoyed it for the next couple of hours.  We got back to the
church super soaked and deliriously happy.
<p>
We played Silent Football, with me as dictator.  Jeremy and Aaron both
asked to use the restroom, so I let them leave the sacred circle, on
the condition that they could not return until the sacred football
goes back into play.  It turns out they were lying and went to goof
around.  So I gave their ghosts 4.5 penance points each and said, when
they returned, the points would be given to Jeremy and Aaron
respectively.  Jeremy came back to the circle not to play, but to
harass the players, who are not allowed to notice anything outside the
sacred circle, and Jeremy sat in Austin&rsquo;s lap!!
<p>
Austin was all Mr Dictator I can&rsquo;t see. So I said How many fingers am
I holding up? and held none up and he said Mr Dictator, I can&rsquo;t see
any. I said Mr Austin is correct, therefore Mr. Dictator declares that
Mr. Austin can see just fine.
<p>
It was so funny and so difficult not to laugh that wow it was just
hysterical to watch Jeremy&rsquo;s face right in front of Austin tryin&rsquo; to
talk.  funny funny funny!!
<p>
I put the football back into play and Bryan immediately raised his
hand &ldquo;Mr Dictator, Mr Dictator said that Mr Jeremy could not return to
the sacred circle until the sacred football goes back into play.  Now
that the sacred football has gone back into play, I see that Jeremy
has appeared in Austin&rsquo;s lap!&rdquo;  I gave Jeremy a warning, citing that
he couldn&rsquo;t have controlled where in the universe he appeared and he
lost soon thereafter anyway.  so so funny.
<p>
Then we cleaned up the table and finished the last bit of bylaws
stuff.
<p>
Jason and Jeremy went to Blockbuster to get Liar Liar while we were
finishing everything.  They came back all, &ldquo;we couldn&rsquo;t get the movie
because Jason&rsquo;s mom has to use her card at the store first before
anyone else can!&rdquo;  and we were all, &ldquo;awww mann!  blah blah blah&rdquo; and
the were like, &ldquo;Wait!  that&rsquo;s not all!  On the way back we walked down
the wrong street to get back and found a garage party with people
drinking beer and smoking bud and we thought- hey the church changed!&rdquo;
<p>
At this point it was 10 minutes to midnight so I was all &ldquo;I have a
card&rdquo; and we drove (actually Jason drove.  (shhhh)) and got the movie
and I had to fill out a new form and get a new card!
<p>
We watched the movie; I hadn&rsquo;t seen it before, and it was better than
I expected.  Afterward, there were sudden shouts of &ldquo;Crush Jeremy&rsquo;s
Dude!&rdquo; and everyone dogpiled Jeremy and then &ldquo;Crush Tia&rsquo;s Dude!&rdquo; and
everyone dogpiled Tia and then &ldquo;Crush Rob&rsquo;s Dude!&rdquo;  and everyone
dogpiled me..  We were much laffing and much hysterical from lack of
sleep.
<p>
But it was only 2AM..  Time for another round of Silent Football!
This time with Aaron as dictator and Jason even played!
<p>
Aaron was fun as dictator.  Almost every time someone would try to
explain their way out of a penance point he would be all, &ldquo;wait! wait!
wait!&rdquo; and interrupt them, &ldquo;what was Mr So-n-so thinking when Mr
So-n-so did that?&rdquo;
<p>
Each time he&rsquo;d start a round, &ldquo;customary tip of the hat&rdquo;  <br>
We&rsquo;d properly respond &ldquo;tip of the hat&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Customary shrooop&rdquo;<br>
We&rsquo;d respond &ldquo;shrrrrooooooooooooooee!!&rdquo;<br>
Because for the past two conferences, Aaron got us all started saying
&ldquo;truuuuuuee!&rdquo; when something is correct.  It&rsquo;s just so silly!!!!
Nevermind.<br></p>

<p><p>
Great game and all that.  Especially since I didn&rsquo;t get a penance
point for saying &ldquo;False&rdquo; without being invited to speak.
<p>
Then we all crashed to sleep at around 4 in the am and I was highly
groggy in the morning when Jason and I left around 8am.
<p>
We had engaging conversation about something (I don&rsquo;t remember what,
but it kept me awake)
<p>
and drove to my church in Houston and got here just about on time
despite the rain and an enormous traffic jam around an enormous church
a couple miles from mine.
<p>
Near the end of the group meeting, Jason and I started talking about
Houston Rally stuff and Jon W agreed to be co-dean of the Houston
Rally 1998. Awesome.

Found out yesterday that all is not perfect with the new invoice service. The program is fine, but the group in charge of making the data files it uses have not got their stuff straight&hellip;
Oh yeah- that&rsquo;s my group in charge of that.  shit.
<p>
So today I&rsquo;m here writing the batch files that will produce the data files and I think I&rsquo;m all done; I&rsquo;m testing them now.
<p>
Tonight I&rsquo;m picking up Jason F at 7pm to drive out to Austin so we can discuss the future of youth programming with the district board. We want to make sure that youth programming remains controlled by the youth.
<br>I&rsquo;ll tell ya later how it all went.
<p>
&ldquo;Howdy!&rdquo; to all my friends at Ultimate tomorrow night who I won&rsquo;t get to see.</p>

<p><p>
Tonight we had super great fun at California Pizza Kitchen! In this case, we = Wende W, Jon W, kT H, Laura M, Dennis ?, Paul R, and me Rob N. This was the first of at least 2 Wednesday night LRY outings. Wende and I told the youth that she and I will go eat at CPK, and if they wanna show up, that would be great!
<p>
Heidi, our waitress, joked a lot, making references to our invisible friends before everyone had arrived. When she came back with our water, I said, &ldquo;Yay!&rdquo; and she teased, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s only water.&rdquo;
That was funny. I kept saying &ldquo;Yay!&rdquo; each time she refilled my glass.
<p>
Jon and I sat at one end of the table and talked about the existence of non-physical beings called Allies. All the stuff he described to me that he had figured out for himself matched quite well with what I had read in the book <em>Bringers of the Dawn</em> by Barbara Marciniak. (This is the third time that Jon has told me stuff he has figured out himself without knowing I had read it in a book somewhere. Amazing!)
<p>
The other portion of the table mostly talked amongst themselves, though I kept an ear listening to them as well. Paul participated in both conversations.
<p>
kT and I made several comments about what Annie likes. Annie is a friend of ours (who we&rsquo;ve never met); Annie likes some things and doesn&rsquo;t like others. The trick is to figure out the pattern of things that she does or does not like. Wende gets so frustrated when we play!
<p>
We had a fun night, though a bit expensive, so we probably won&rsquo;t eat there again next week. We will keep lookin&rsquo; around to find just the perfect spot for our weekly friendly gatherings.

Today I added frames to my website! My <a href=../../skate/frame.html>Wild Skating Adventures</a> and <a href=../../gravity/frame.html>Gravity</a> now use frames to let you view them.
<p>
I certainly don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s any better this way, but now I&rsquo;ve had practice with making some simple frames, and I&rsquo;m happy.
<p>
I learned all about how to do it at a great HTML tutorial site: <a href=https://www.htmlgoodies.com>www.htmlgoodies.com</a>!

Today we presented my new invoice service to the supervisors and managers of the groups who will be using it. They loved it! It lets them view the invoices much more quickly and queues as many as they want to the printers and it&rsquo;s all good.
<p>
Now it&rsquo;s just got to go through testing, and will be moved online hopefully pretty soon. The next big part is converting the old data to the new format so it can be read.
<p>
Yay!

Yesterday evening rain began to fall as Wende and I were finishing up at the laundry mat. We got home and she carried both baskets up (I unlocked the door) and then she hijacked my keys and pulled us both outside to play in the rain!
<p>
We laughed and splashed, giggling, frolicking down the street. I found it difficult to kick puddles at her without getting splashed myself! We kissed and played, hugged for warmth.
<p>
Looking up at the fine droplets, I remembered being 7 years old, watching snow gently sift onto my face and tongue while hanging from monkey bars in the back yard. This time, 20 years later, I was wearing shorts and a tank top, barefoot on asphalt, enjoying the night.
<p>
The coolest thing we saw was a manhole cover covered with about an inch of water, with little whirlpools slurping water down through the holes. The physics that drive whirlpools intrigues me.
<p>
Holding hands, back toward the house we walked, gently not splashing through the puddles. It had stopped raining by the time we got back. I&rsquo;m so glad Wende encouraged us to go play in the rain.

This day I completed and sent to be tested my latest project at work. It&rsquo;s an application that allows users to display invoices and print them and all that. Many people will use it each day; I&rsquo;m really excited (and almost nervous) that I have written such a highly visible project.
<p>
I tested the shit out of it, made sure my documentation covered every detail, every message that the user might see. I designed it to be easily modified, and easy to understand.
<p>
This is the same project that got the inadvertant stress testing
a few days ago. It&rsquo;s finally complete, after months of work. I&rsquo;m excited to see it go online.

Today at church, the youth group got some great plans underway for this year&rsquo;s activities.  First on our calendar is planning for a church-wide fund raising (for Unicef) Talent Show!
<p>
I absolutely love how the youth are brainstorming, planning, organizing all their own activities. Wende and I are just there to help guide them but let them pretty much do their own thing.
<p>
Next planned thing (which will actually occur before the talent show) is a lock-in / haunted house creating day on the weekend of the 26 of October. We&rsquo;ll come in early on Saturday and help the younger kids build their haunted house. Once we&rsquo;re done and they&rsquo;re gone, we&rsquo;ll go to a professional haunted house and then come back and play and whatever until Sunday morning.
<p>
Sunday morning we&rsquo;ll help run the kids&rsquo; haunted house or whatever. Should be great fun.
