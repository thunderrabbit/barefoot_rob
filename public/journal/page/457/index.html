<p>Leaving for Austin now.</p>

<p class=date>6:42pm</p>

<p>Back at Bibby's now, with lots of laughter, "man it was so fast, it
was like we just left yesterday."</p>

<p>I got a piece of glass in my foot at Charity's house when we picked
up some stuff of hers to take to Austin.  For the fun of it, drove
backwards on Bibby's street for fully 1.5 blocks back to their
house.</p>

<p class=date>7:00pm</p>

<p>Got it.  Looked like a little fleck of metal paint or tile.</p>

<p class=date>10:36pm</p>

<p>We're here in Austin now.  Listened to a lot of Eminem really loud
much of the latter half of the trek, after the first half included
Pink Floyd on repeat.</p>

<p>Have just been to the house of a guy who makes art out of found
items, and who might be the same cat who made a picture frame that Jon
gave to me/Wende a couple years ago.</p>

<p class=date>4:34am</p>

<p>Done rearranging Janette's space now at Uncommon Objects.  At 1am,
we visited Magnolia Grill and the waitress was really really nice,
with big smile to the point that it really felt like she was flirting
with <em>me</em>, but I watched her and she was just as friendly with
all the other tables.  She's tallish with short dark straight hair and
an upside down star tattoo inside her right elbow/forearm.</p>

<p>Janette generously gave her a five dollar tip, and I doubled it to
ten after a twelve dollar meal.  As we left, I walked slowly and
watched her get to the table and she was all, "hey, thanks!" and
looked up at us and I blew her a kiss.</p>

<p>Didn't think to give her one of my yellow adventure cards, but oh
well.</p>

<p>In Dallas now, this morning paying bills (cell phone, Scott
maintenance, credit card).  Tonight Janette and I are going to Austin
so I can help her with moving stuff around at the resale shop where
she has some items.</p>

<p class=date>2:51pm</p>

<p>I'm slowly learning things about myself as I begin to embrace this
adventure.  I've been planning to go to OKC and figure I'll go there
on Thursday (after helping Janette in Austin for the next couple of
days) and then go to Tulsa, then Little Rock or Hot Springs,
etc....</p>

<p>And then I remember that I told Liza Ely that I might come to Tyler
to see her <a href="https://www.centerofwellbeing.com">Center of Well
Being</a> and such, and I throw my brain into a tizzy trying to
reschedule to get all these visits in.  I don't have to go see her.  I
don't even really know her.  I just gotta begin my adventure and
fucking go.  I don't know why I'm being so scared of taking the first
step.</p>

<p>It's something like I'm looking for permission to go, or approval
that it's the right thing to do.  I'm completely free right now.  No
one and nothing to tell me what to do except myself.  And I trap
myself.</p>

<p>So strange.</p>

<p>On the way home from church, Joey and I noted that Janette has
never played Silent Football, so we called Jackie who met us at
Bibby's so we could introduce the game to Janette!</p>

<p>Got home, Ellen called Joey to do French homework and was hijacked
to play as well.</p>

<p>Ellen zoomed in the fastest cutest way that cannot be described,
but it was so cute that she got negative 1/2 penance point.</p>

<p>Jackie said "he" a lot and then was declared (by Joey (who was
Dictatress at the time)) she can only use the pronoun "he" and not
even first person singulars.</p>

<p>I set up a two way wormhole which we used well for a while and then
Janette had to go P and while she was gone, I declared a wormhole
between Ellen and myself without telling Janette.</p>

<p>Then, even funnier than that: while Ellen was away, and Joey and I
were making faces at each other</p>

<p>Janette did the best little bunny foo foo dance that was SO Funny!
something like "Little Bunny Foo Foo hopping through the forest,
picking up the field mice and bopping them on the head, and the mouse
said 'ow!!'"
<br>"Little Doctor Foo Foo hopping through the hospital, picking up the
field mouse and stapling him on the head"</p>

<p>Janette in a Georgia accent to Joey as dictator "Madam Vagina
Sweet Potato..".</p>

<p>Then Janette tried to claim that everyone had been mispronouncing
her name though she didn't let us know until late in the game.  Then
she wondered if she could get penance points removed for having been
insulted for so long.</p>

<p class=date>7:06pm</p>

<p>Eating pizza now (me, Janette, Joey, Jackie) as Janette and I relay
the story from yesterday.</p>

<p>I'm pretty much still sleeping since the party.  I have slept while
floating on the pool, sitting in the hottub, sleeping on my back
inside.</p>

<p class=date>10:43am</p>

<p>At Denny's now with Joey 80 cents on the tollway to get here.
We're both glad that we don't live on a tollway ourselves.  The rest
of the group (from Jackie's Party) will be coming shortly.</p>

<p class=date>11:01am</p>

<p>Joey points out that this engagement has been a lot like a rally:</p>

<p>Silent Football 
Mafia 
Dance with strobelight 
Limited sleep 
Denny's
More than one UU (8: Joey, Jackie (Judy, Janice, Jackie the Sackie on
Yackie, Jackie the RE Board Liaison on Yac, Jack the Sac on Yac (SF
name))), Jack the Sac on Yac, Aaron Ryan, Danny Seigal, Ryan McC, Rob,
Janet (friend of Jackie's) (Dave points out that more than 1/2 of the
group now at Denny's is UU)
</p>

<p>Some things made it unlike a rally:</p>

<p>Two per blanket
Pool / Hot tub
Billiards
No talent show
No workshops
Jackie Purdy's birthday
Katy with a Y's birthday
No worship
Aged out UUs (2: Ryan, Danny)
smoking (out front of the house only)
only one night</p>

<p class=date>12:03pm</p>

<p>Nathie has several talents: drumming (in a band), scuba diving (he
argues that it's not a talent, but we argue that he could have
drowned), Etch-A-Sketch drawing (he's apparently really good), and MS
Paint drawing (Katy says he's pretty good at MS Paint, but she sees it
as a bunch of lines and squiggles.  He'll have to show her some of his
better ones, he says.)</p>

<p class=date>12:26pm</p>

<p>Playing Ceiling Wall Floor now.  Most people don't know how to
play.  Good stuff.</p>

<p>Janette and I are in the emergency room.  We went down to Turtle
Creek and explored down a big drain tube that drains water from a lake
thing that I'm not going to try and describe yet.</p>

<p>Inside the tube the bottom was curved and slick with slime and she
slipped and I heard her head <em>CONK</em> on the concrete.  Ow ow ow
oh shit.  I hugged her head and held the back of it.  Blood drizzled
down my hand and her hair and shirt and eww.  Doh, this wasn't the
plan at all.</p>

<p>"Okay," I said, trying to remain calm yet assuring, "we need to go
to the hospital." I showed her, "there's blood, see?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't need to do that; I'll just take a shower."</p>

<p>"Joey is going to fire me if she finds out that I didn't make you
go to an ER."</p>

<p>Put a blanket over the seat, checked her eyes for dialation
(Janette jokingly crossed her eyes while I looked) and got ice on the
way home, which spilled lots of cubes and was pretty funny if not for
the blood and guts.  Okay no guts, but blood.</p>

<p>Janette's a brave girl.</p>

<p class=date>6:09pm</p>

<p>Watched an episode of the Simpsons (Homer = Billionaire for a day)
and the ice we had originally all melted, so I flirted with the girl
who registered Janette and got some new crushed ice out of a machine
somewhere.  Awesome.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Background info:</p>

<p>At 4:30pm, we left a note for Joey that we're going for a walk down
at Turtle Creek.</p>

<p>Drove there; it's not too far, and I told Janette all about my joys
and concerns from the past weeks and past few days.  Was awestruck by
a chasm in the middle of the creek, where water was perfectly calm at
the top and just cascasding gently into a cylinder about 25 feet in
diameter and deep enough that we couldn't see the bottom.  Wow!  wow!
wow!</p>

<p>How incredibly cool to just see the water falling into some mystery
aberation in the otherwise perfectly still water.  Niagra falls on a
miniature scale, but still pretty big.</p>

<p>Walked across a street and I noticed a tunnel down in the ravine.
"There's our entrance to the hole!"</p>

<p>So we climbed down into the ravine and walked down this large
tunnel that got darker and darker as we progressed.  About a hundred +
feet into it, the tunnel curved and presto, we were looking into the
chasm from below.  Magic and amazing.</p>

<p>I slipped a bit, but caught myself, and we were all good and about
to leave when Janette was walking her way down the slope and I thought
about helping her when SHWOOop <em>CONK</em> oh fuck that sucks.</p>

<p>Held her, then walked her back through the tunnel and out to the
car.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class=date>6:39pm</p>

<p>Proof that Janette is cool and tough:</p>

<p>"We could get the whole room to play The Jackie Purdy Game.
Everyone could sing a song about their injury."</p>

<p class=date>7:19pm</p>

<p>The guy across this part of the waiting area has football pants and
pads on and his arm in a sling.  I asked him how long he's been
here.</p>

<p>Since 3:30.  He has a deep(?) would between the tarsals(?) /
metatarsals (?) of his hand; he got it hitting the face mask on
another player's helmet.</p>

<p>Ow.  They've been here for 4 hours.  Poop.</p>

<p class=date>8:44pm</p>

<p>Decided to try our luck elsewhere and took Janette off the list at
the ER and drove to the Quack Shack near her house.  But it was
closed.  It closed at 5pm, so we might have barely made it if we had
gone there first.  Oh I think we would not have since we left a note
for Joey at 4:30 for our original walk.</p>

<p>Went to a drive-thru for vanilla shake (me) and chocolate malt
(she) and then to her house to look up another 24 hour emergency room
that's not so backed up, since when I called 411 on my phone they were
unable to help me if I didn't have the name of the place.  It's not
like we need to call 911, but seems like there's a market in Dallas
for 24 hour care centers given that mofos in here are waiting 5+ hours
to be seen.  That shit is fucked up.</p>

<p>Thankfuly, the nurse was willing to put Janette's paperwork back in
line in the same order it had been before she left.  I'm glad about
that; she didn't have to do this for us.</p>

<p>But seriously, five fuckin' hours?  What a fucked up system.</p>

<p class=date>9:03pm</p>

<p>Hehehe, a woman just queried me about my computer.  I like it a
lot.</p>

<p>Oh, and for the record, this is the first time in a long time
(since Arwen twisted her knee???) that I've been in an ER and not been
the reason I was there.</p>

<p class=date>10:24pm</p>

<p>Just now we are back in the ER.  The nurse has done a preliminary
look and guesses that she'll be able to get stitches.  She'll
definitely get a tetanus shot.  Saw our football guy who had already
gotten stitches in his hand.  It was split about 1/2 an inch into his
hand betwen two of his fingers.  I think pointer and middle
finger.</p>

<p class=date>10:51pm</p>

<p>Courtney the nurse has shaved a 1.5 x 2 inch section on the back of
Janette's head with strokes that made me go "eeek! not so hard!" in my
mind as Janette squeezed my hand and I squeezed back while watching
Courtney reveal a dark red split over the lump with lilly white skin
and super short hairs growing all around, and little pink rivulets of
blood easing their way down into the hair below.  If I had my camera,
I would take a picture and I promise I would put it online.</p>

<p>Janette has just left for the restroom to try seeing the
injury.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>The cat to our right is snoring inconsistently with lots of starts
and stops.</p>

<p>The cat to our left said he pushed a bottle too hard into a
trashcan and it broke, slicing up his hand.  They just took X-rays of
his hand with a portable X-ray machine to see if he has glass embedded
that must be removed before stitching it up.</p>

<p>I'm thinking he had to push pretty hard to break a glass
bottle.</p>

<p class=date>11:21pm</p>

<p>Oh man Janette and I are laughing laughing, as we wonder if Joey is
going to ground us and not let me hang with Janette anymore.  Just
called Joey, but she's not home, probably is spending the night
somewhere.  We left a note that included, "don't listen to the
answering machine message, it's a surprise and sorta funny.  Remember
Pandora's Box!"  So we know that she probably hasn't listened to the
message and has no idea about what's going on and that her mom is
about to get staples in her head in the emergency room, etc blah blah
blah.</p>

<p>So we were joking about catching up with Joey wherever she is and
being all, "hey Jo, .. look!!" as Janette twists around to reveal a
bloody gash on the back of her head.  "Here, I'll put some matted
bloody hair on your stuffed bear so you can keep it."</p>

<p>"Mommy loves you, go back to sleep now."</p>

<p class=date>11:51pm</p>

<p>Man, how long will it take for the doctor to get here to staple her
head?</p>

<p class=date>12:07am</p>

<p>Nurse just breezed through and saw Janette's head and breezed out.
Maybe something will happen soon.</p>

<p class=date>12:15am</p>

<p>We are just dumbfounded by the string of medications the nurse next
to us with the inconsistent snoring guy just rattled off.  All the
stuff he is taking from morpheine to brain medication to heart
medication to nicotine patches and all kinds of shit.  He's had
difficulty moving his arm and fingers and obviously difficulty
breathing.  His saline level in his blood is low and he doesn't drink
a lot of water but does drink some tea.  I'm guessing more like Lipton
than Japanese Green Tea.</p>

<p>"That's Western medicine at its finest," I say.</p>

<p class=date>12:24am</p>

<p>Nurse breezed through again, "the doctor is on the phone right now
with a patient, but I'm sure she'll be with you in a second."</p>

<p class=date>12:28am</p>

<p>The hand guy just told the nurse that he pressed an aquarium too
hard and it broke.</p>

<p>Down the hall we can hear a woman crying after some cat in her
family came in with gunshot wounds.</p>

<p class=date>12:44am</p>

<p>Kirk is back and swabbing her head now.</p>

<p class=date>12:55am</p>

<p>Kirk just gave Janette and the bottle/aquarium guy each a tetnus shot.</p>

<p class=date>2:49am</p>

<p>Done.  I passed out almost.  Watched some of the staples as they
were put in, and the clicking of the stapler got to me I think.  And
it kept misfiring and the doc had to pull some out of her head.</p>

<p>The first time the stapler didn't work correctly, the doctor
started to whistle as if to assure us, <em>everything is fine, don't
worry about a thing as I rip these staples out and throw them onto the
floor</em>.  Janette was wincing hard with pain, even though the
doctor had novacained or lidocained her injury (causing a lot of
wincing as well (and a lot of bleeding, which he said was a good thing
since it means the cut will heal quite effectively)).</p>

<p>As I felt myself passing out, I put my head down to get blood back
into it but that didn't help as I could still hear the gun clicking
its evil springy misfirings and the doctor whistling his soothing
tune.</p>

<p>Once Janette was done, I lay down on the stretcher until I was
fully un-passed out.</p>

<p class=date>3:40am</p>

<p>Went to the pharmacy now instead of in the day because I believed
it would be a lot less crowded now than during the day.  I was right,
but the pharmacist said we were lucky; it can get crowded any time of
the day or night.</p>

<p>Jack and I are fashionably early to Jackie Purdy's Party, by 2
hours minus 3 minutes.  "We win the race! Whoohoo!" exclaims Jack.</p>

<p class=date>7:05pm</p>

<p>Jack has predicted that Ryan McCarthy is going to arrive quite late
(11pm ish) and be quite disappointed that there is less "partying"
happening than another party might have.</p>

<p>Jackie will be 10,000 days on 31 January 2012.</p>

<p>We are here at the Jacke Purdy Pre Party now.</p>

<p class=date>1:16am</p>

<p>Jack and I drove home to get Joey and told her the party didn't
make and everyone left.  She totally bought it and we didn't know what
to do after that so I said I forgot my camera and we should go back to
get it.  I don't know yet if she knows that we were fibbing to her.</p>

<p>I'm really really happy that my computer has been used as the DJ
for the entire night (except when there was a live band, but even then
the computer was still playing music, just not as loudly as the band);
people have been selecting music from this library and/or putting
their own CDs in to play.  I have ripped 4 CDs tonight and have eyes
on one more.</p>

<p class=date>4:03am</p>

<p>Played Silent Football for about a bit over an hour probably.
Thomas (I think is his name) lost, due to overenthusiastic tattling.</p>

<p>Ryan is now leading us in a game of Mafia.  He's being quite loud
with running around with foot stomping to tap on people's heads to
choose who is the commissioner and who is mafia.  Pretty funny stuff.
Can't believe that he doesn't think I can type while my eyes are
closed.</p>

<p>I'm guessing that Thomas (snookums) is going to lose pretty
quickly.  Since he's dead already.  Due to the group pretty much not
wanting him to talk anymore, I'm guessing.  All but a few people voted
for him because dead people can't talk.  No, I mean "<em>dead people
can't talk</em>."</p>

<p class=date>4:20am</p>

<p>"Where'd God go?"</p>

<p>Danny: "Wait, who's mafia?"</p>

<p>Aaron: "Let's all choose someone to kill so the votes won't be
random."</p>

<p>"Aaron."</p>

<p>"Aaron."</p>

<p>"Aaron."</p>

<p>Aaron, "wait, can we go back to that random thing?"</p>

<p class=date>4:23am</p>

<p>Mafia won.  2 of 2 mafia remain out of a 10 person town.</p>

<p class=date>4:23am</p>

<p>New game now, with Jack the Sac on Yac as god.</p>

<p class=message>Jackie, birthday girl number one, has tragically died
in a horrible fishing accident. Gory details aren't needed. Her best
friend, Lizard has moved into her vacated house on
BetweenAaronandNicci Street, only to be killed by Jackie's ghost a few
rounds later, in an act of undead revenge.</p>

<p class=message>After trying unsuccessfully to type the following
paragraph myself, I have given in to lettin Ryan type it.</p>

<p class=message>"It is duly noted that the game that ryan (aka master
of insects and pronouns) was god of ended in crime running amok in the
streets, while the game that jack (aka, grand poobah of consideropia)
was god of ended in compassion and justice."</p>

                        <p class=date>10:20am CDT Thursday 12 September 2002</p>

<p>I have found a relatively good way to keep myself feeling
productive and even keeled, stable (not like a horse house, but like a
rock), happy, etc.  That is to make a simple list of things to do each
morning.  I've known this for years, but haven't really done it every
day since my personal schedule would be so wildly chaotic and my work
schedule would be relatively rigid.</p>

<p>So what'd end up happening is I wake up early one morning and be
all relaxed and take time to write up a list of thingies to do that
day and get some shit done and feel all productive and basically on
top of stuff including go to work and it would be all great.</p>

<p>And that might even go on for a day or two, but sooner than later I
would stay up late late late one night and drag my ass out of bed just
in time for work and not take a moment in the morning to figure out
what kinda stuff I should do and take a moment to breathe and all
that, and my sense of productivity would collapse in a heap, leading
me to feel relatively poopy and not wanting to take time for myself,
for who would want to take time to hang out with an unproductive slob
like me?</p>

<p>So today I wrote a list of stuff to do, and I've done about half of
it, most of which I could do online (contact peeps, look up phone
numbers of other peeps) and some of it is time dependent (visit a
store that opens at 11am, see Sally at 4pm) and some of it is not
Urgent right now (capital U from <em>Seven Habits...</em> book) so I'm
not doing it; and some of it requires me to overcome some hurdle or
decide if it's 'worth it' (to spend the money, or do I really want to
talk to this person <! Madeline, which I do, but I am giving priority
to Sally>).  And to be certain, I haven't done this for more than 1
day in a row, but my previous list was on the 8th, so only 3 days
skipped.  Maybe I'll keep it up.</p>

<p>Whoo!  I'm chillin' in the A.C.E.S. room 2.302, an auditorium in
which Ted and Sally will each be doing their thesis presentations.
Just got a quick version of Ted's presentation.  Sally isn't here
right now.  We joked about her having forgotten about it.  Not too
likely, but still funny.</p>

<p>This building is apparently sporting a wireless network, but it's
down from today through the 16th.  Funny.</p>

<p class=date>7:56pm</p>

<p>Back at Fred's apartment now.  After Sally's thesis thing during
which she appeared calm cool collected and faced the audience in a
bright smiley way and I understood almost none of it, we (her chicamow
(mom), dad, advisor Jay, me) went to Trudy's for dinner.  Her friend
Suzanne showed up after a bit and Sally chatted with her, while her
mom chatted with Jay, and I moved my chair over and talked with her
dad who has worked as a security manager (I'm making up that term) for
Saudi Arabia since 1978.  He had a few things to say about the current
situation.  And by few I mean like five.</p>

<p>Before the reseating, Sally had been sitting across from me and we
played footsies a lot.  I really really really really really really
really really really like her.  a lot.</p>

<p>oh, before her presentation was Ted's presentation, and Sally held
my hand a bit :-), mostly cause she was way way nervous about her
presentation.</p>

<p class=date>9:29pm</p>

<p>Talked funny stuff (XXX starring Vin Diesel, MIIB starring Will
Smith, etc starring whomever) with Bill and Fred while waiting for
Sally to call.  We ate banana/orange/strawberry(?) yogurt
smoothies.</p>

<p>Sally called and I'm chillin' with her now.  Actually she is on the
phone, but yeah. bye.</p>

<p class=date>1:00am</p>

<p>SO Much Fun!!  Sally and I started for a walk outside her hotel and
then she was all, "wouldn't it be cool if we had bikes??"  But we do!
Zipped over to Fred's apartment and got a Bibby Cookie each and my
bike and Fred's bike and rode all over downtown Austin, from his
apartment around the capital to thin brick paths steeply coursing
through a park to a spooky spooky dark sidewalk along a creek and
under some bridges totally dark and slowly right past a guy sleeping
on the ground.  I was quite startled by him but didn't say anything
until later "was that a <em>guy</em>?"  how wild!</p>

<p>After rolling around the board chalk of white bumpy rocks, followed
our ears to music and rolled Into 6th street type area with empty
streets blocked off just for us to roll in huge sine wave designs
between rows of parked cars and inebriated folk walking along the
sidewalks.  Sally bought a bottle of water for us to share.  Out of
that area and down a long hill with 4 Way STOP signs through which I
rolled really quickly trusting that any cross traffic would stop.</p>

<p>Down to the small creek river thing beside which people play disc
golf and found a park but kept rolling till we found a spot to chill
on some lumpy rocks within the middle of the creek bed.  We drank
water, marveled at the beautiful variety of sights we had seen in such
a short period of time!  Remarkable.</p>

<p>We lay facing the stars (could see approximately 3 through the
overcast sky) with my leg as her pillow and our water bottle as
mine. She told me how thankful she was that I had come to see her
presentation and I was all, "you're my favorite favorite
favorite!"</p>

<p>After our rest, we returned along the trail and wound our way under
another bridge and up some streets to arrive back at Fred's
apartment.</p>
