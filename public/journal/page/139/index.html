<p>One of my rules of journaling is to just start again instead of trying
to catch up on old events.  So before I break that rule, here&rsquo;s now:</p>

<p>Right now I&rsquo;m on the train headed to Ebisu to meet S at CB for our
weekly meeting.  I was hoping to have it yesterday cause I was in the
area, and I don&rsquo;t have any other reason to come today.</p>

<h2 id="saturday-6-august-2016">Saturday 6 August 2016</h2>

<p>On Saturday I went to Mitsue&rsquo;s ukelele event where she sang!  I need
to put the video online, but I want to crop the end off first and I
don&rsquo;t see how to do that easily without uploading it somewhere.  Can
youtube do it?  lgmtfmyself  Great to see her and Soness there too!
Met Mitsue&rsquo;s family; her dad seems quite genki.  He kept whapping my
leg to emphasize his jokes.</p>

<p>On the way home I took the &ldquo;last bus&rdquo;
from somewhere and just made my connection to another last bus.
Except that I was on the wrong side of the road and the bus I wanted
zoomed by at exactly the wrong time as I was exactly in the wrong
place.  Dang.  I walked home for about an hour.</p>

<h2 id="sunday-7-august-2016">Sunday 7 August 2016</h2>

<p>On Sunday I did Mikoshi with the crew from 大島二丁目.  My boy Yuki
got me an outfit and everything.  Mutual recognition with many of the
peeps who were there last year (my first time) and probably many years
before that and many years to come.  When new friends were like &ldquo;yo
jack why are you barefoot?&rdquo; by saying more concisely 裸足大丈夫？ The
regulars were like, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s his policy&rdquo; hahaha awsome.</p>

<p>Had dinner with Yuki&rsquo;s father at the end, but respectfully declined
this year when they asked if I&rsquo;d join at the public bath.  It was
great fun last year, but that&rsquo;s when my house was 2 blocks away.  This
year it&rsquo;s 2 hours away.</p>

<p>Arrived home and my shoulder was aching to the extent that I asked Lin
to apply one of those medicated patches that she so dearly loves.
It&rsquo;s still sore but no longer swollen.</p>

<h2 id="last-night-8-august-2016">last night 8 August 2016</h2>

<p>Okay so last night after I-group, whereas I normally walk to Shibuya
afterward and take Inokashira Line to Shimokitazawa and then Odakyu
Line to our house, I found a much shorter way!  I&rsquo;ll need to compare
prices (and sort out the details), but it should get my home a lot
sooner on I-group nights.</p>

<p>Basically: bus to Shibuya, Denentoshi line to Meidaimaira (sp) and
then a bus bound for Ikuta which stops within 300 meters of our
house.  Nice!  (Walking from Shin Yurigaka is like 4 times that).</p>

<p>Last night I arrived in Maidaimaira (sp) and thought I had the bus
stops figured out but the bus didn&rsquo;t come.  I recalibrated and the
next bus didn&rsquo;t come.  I recalibrated with Google maps again, but this
time I asked the guy at the train window and he looked it up for me.
He confirmed that my new plan was okay, and I had been at the right
stop (but waiting for a different bus).   Anyway the new plan required
changing buses, but the first bus got stuck in construction traffic so
I missed the last bus &hellip; egad. I just wanted to go home.  Fortunately
my phone held its charge long enough for me to take a few quick
glances at maps and I walked home.  1.6 km ftw!</p>

<p>Though we almost got sidetracked with describing days relative to
today, I think our lesson on &ldquo;a&rdquo; and &ldquo;the&rdquo; went quite well.  I hadn&rsquo;t
taught this lesson in a while.  I remember I used to have a cache of
plastic fat horse characters of a variety of colors and a few
different sizes.  They were perfect for the &ldquo;a - the&rdquo; game.</p>

<p>Mayumi created some cards with crayons on them with different colors
and different lengths.  Perfect!!  Super thanks to her for making
those for the lesson.</p>

<p>Next week there&rsquo;s no official lesson, but some (one?) of the students
want(s) to pay cash for a lesson so we&rsquo;ll probably meet in a cafe in
the area.</p>

<p>Sweet!  I&rsquo;ll head to Perth again to staff with a bunch of other great
men for their 10 year anniversary training.</p>

<p>Just gotta pay for the tickets by Friday, tell work, my other work,
Lin, and Lin&rsquo;s friend the flight attendant on Cathay Pacific.  Oh, and
the guys in OZ.</p>

<h2 id="14-30">14:30</h2>

<p>Paid for the tickets, primarily with 500 yen coins.  But no, I didn&rsquo;t
dump them on the desk at the travel agency; I put them in the ATM
machine.  (Yep, cash (including change) is accepted by ATMs and
automagically counted, confirmed, and applied to the customer&rsquo;s
account.)</p>

<p>The weird thing was I thought I had 8000 yen in my account, put 73500
yen into my account, and then a couple hours later, pulled out 93000
yen.  Did someone add money to my account or did I misread and/or
misremember 8000 yen?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m headed to work on the local train; we left 新百合ケ丘 at 10:12am.
I&rsquo;m not sure what time we&rsquo;ll arrive in 新宿, but I have a seat, my
computer, art supplies, and a snack, so I should be able to keep
myself entertained until we arrive.</p>

<p>Haha just kidding; my main concern is arriving on time, but yeah I
have my computer because I had been reading at home, wondering just
how long I could keep going before rushing off to my meeting on
time&hellip; hey wait a minute; if I take a local train I can read <em>while</em>
going to work.</p>

<p>AND, Lin just so happened to be driving to her appointment, so I rode
with her to the station.  Lin&rsquo;s mom needed a ride to the clinic, so
she joined the fun.</p>

<p>At the top of the hill, Lin&rsquo;s mom asked (in Japanese), &ldquo;what&rsquo;s down
that street where the red car is stopped?&rdquo;  (even though Lin couldn&rsquo;t
see the red car for the car ahead of us on the road.)</p>

<p>Lin goes &ldquo;MOOooooOOOmmm that&rsquo;s the street with your bus stop!  See the
bank is right there so the bus stop is down there, right??&rdquo;  (in
Japanese)</p>

<p>The light turned green and we summarily took the road in question.</p>

<p>Now my question: why couldn&rsquo;t Lin just say &ldquo;oh just a moment; we&rsquo;re
about to go down it so you can see for yourself.&rdquo;  ??</p>

<h2 id="10-56">10:56</h2>

<p>just arrived in Shinjuku.  44 minutes.</p>

<p>It seems like there was something wrong with my rsync command, but I
didn&rsquo;t change anything.</p>

<p>I blew away my directory online and rsynced again and it seems to work
now.</p>

<p>Huh.  I have a ton of files from my journal with messed up dates
/1/01/01</p>

<p><a href="https://new.robnugen.com/journal/1/01/01/done-today/">https://new.robnugen.com/journal/1/01/01/done-today/</a>   &lt;&ndash; should be <a href="https://new.robnugen.com/journal/2015/02/23/done-today/">https://new.robnugen.com/journal/2015/02/23/done-today/</a></p>
