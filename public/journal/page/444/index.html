<p>I'm in Springfield and Amelia and Erik's house.  Erik was
unimpressed with my Mac until he really started looking at it.  I told
him I wouldn't tell anyone, so um, nevermind.</p>

<p>He got a phone call and hung up saying, "soon there will be two
Jenni's here."</p>

<p>"You can't go wrong with two Jenny's," I agreed.</p>

<p>At this very moment there are 2 Jenni's sitting on Erik and
tickling him, as he tries in vain to squirm away.  Wow, how can one
guy endure such torture?</p>

<p>hahahaha</p>

<p>Erik is a big guy.  Each Jenny is about half his mass.  What a
funny sight!</p>

<p class=date>5:35pm</p>

<p>Now, Jenny wants Erik to do errands with her and Jenni wants Erik
to magically have already downloaded some anime for her.  Jenny was
pouting gloriously while Jenni was griping that he wasn't ready to go
yet.</p>

<p>"It's not fair for both of you to be mad at me at the same time!"</p>

<p>Tonight we watched <em>Deep Blue Sea</em> and <em>Dead Poets
Society</em>.  I had seen DPS, but not DBS.  DPS was better.  but Erik
certainly liked DBS.</p>

<p>He and Amelia argued about its merits.  Amelia went to bed before
we started DPS.</p>

<p>I'm going to bed now too.  Know why?  I'm tired.</p>

<p>I get to sleep in Amelia's old room tonight, on a Pretty Princess
Bed.  I'm sure this style has a name other than that, but it's
basically shaped topologically like a couch with with iron sides and
back to keep me from falling out at night.  Very pretty and very
princessey. </p>

<p>Getting ready for dream capturing tonight.</p>

<p class=date>5:54am CDT Friday 18 October 2002</p>

<p>I seem to be done sleeping.  I had a dream about being in
California, though I don't remember who else was there.</p>

<p>In a different dream, I was in this neighborhood in Columbia, and
had carte blanche  for everything I wanted.  Becky from WV was funding
everything.  Sh kept saying "it doesn't matter" when I told her how
much stuff would cost.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I'm suddenly thinking a lot about my missing camera.  How would
this trip have been different if I had a camera?  When I take
pictures, it's usually of things or signs or people that I meet, and
rarely pictures that include me, for that would mean letting someone
else work the camera, plus something else like me being egotistical
"oh take a picture of me! *I'm* the star; take a cpicture of me" and I
think that's coming from the time I went to Costa Rica with Katherine
(sp) and she got mad at me because I kept asking her to take pictures
of me whereever we went.  "It's all about you.." or some shit like
that.</p>

<p>Well, I hereby release that false concern and will take as many
pictures of me and my peeps as I want.  From now on.  soon as I get my
camera back.</p>

<p>It's at Best Buy, or maybe they have finished the work and sent it
to Bibby's house.  But I haven't heard from them that it's there.  How
strange to have gone on this entire adventure and not have a single
picutre, except those in my mind.</p>

<p>I don't even think anyone else has taken a picture that includes
me, except for security cameras in stores and such.  That could prove
that I've been places.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>This non-camera-having adventure has given me an opportunity to
practice descriptive writing, and has saved me from spending a lot
more time on my computer processing images.  Somewhere between these
two extremes (SWUUSI and this trek) is a balance of sorts.  It
includes better software than iPhoto, and a better layout on my
website for pictures.</p>

<p>I will likely purchase a disposable camera from the drugstore down
the street so I can get pics of at least my old neighborhood.</p>

<p>I think I will go for a walk to those places I remember walking to.
Drugstore, the creek (drainage ditch), around the block.  How far away
are these places really?</p>

<p>I just talked with Brenda at D&H; smilingly told her of my
adventures at Ridgeway.  When I said, "the principal is Mrs Fales, my
first grade teacher... and she remembered me!" a wave of sadness
washed over me..</p>

<p>But not sadness exactly, more like "wow I can't believe she
actually remembered <em>me</em>" feeling of relief, disbelief,
amazement. I'm not sure what to call it, but I wasn't willing to cry
in the store; I held it back.</p>

<p>Thank you Brenda for being a smiling mirror for my adventure.
Thank you for your encouragement to write to the Tribune.</p>

<p>I have just called the number in the phone book for David, my best
friend from 1st grade.  It's his old line and is now used as his mom's
comptuer line, but still has his name on it in the phone book.  She
gave me his phone number in Scottsdale AZ!</p>

<p>According to her, he's a chef now.  Totally awesome!</p>

<p>Okay, so I woke up to this most recent dream:</p>

<p class=dream>I found myself outside of this (Norma's) house, and
walking past my old house.  Did they add on that garage?  Hmmm.  What
about that wall there?  I tried to visualize myself at 8 years old,
playing in these locations.  These were added onto the right hand side
of the house, as viewed from the street.  The house looked so small.
I was surprised by how quickly I walked past it and the other
houses.</p>

<p class=dream>I turned back around and noticed how I seemed to be out
of body; I could just let myself float anywhere I wanted to go; allow
my 8-year-old's mind just lead the way.</p>

<p class=dream>He looked up and I noticed my car was gone; I saw it
being driven toward the back of my old house, so I walked after it and
discovered that all the cars that had been parked in front of the
street there had been targeted.</p>

<p class=dream>I walked back there all mad at first, "hey! blah blah
blah" and then I immediately apologized and said, "I have a fantastic
story to tell you, and it's all true," to the guy who seemed to be the
boss of this operation.</p>

<p class=dream>Next to him were two Mexican cats and they looked quite
interested in my story so I asked "hablan ingles?" of them, and added
"muy bien o un poco?"</p>

<p class=dream>"Un poco," they smiled.</p>

<p class=dream>Ah well, so I didn't try to translate it for them; I
don't think I know that much spanish, even in my dreams.</p>

<p class=dream>"See that house there?"  We were behind it and couldn't
actually see it, but he knew where I was pointing.  "I used to live
there 24 years ago."</p>

<p class=dream>His stern look melted away.  "Really?"</p>

<p class=dream>"Yep, and I have just been talking to Norma and to
Jill, and they all said it was fine for me to park on the
street.."</p>

<p class=dream>"Well, this is the minimum I can charge you" and the
ticket had been crossed off from $80 to $30 to $3.00.  I thought about
asking him to just skip the whole thing, but I realized it as a dream
and that when we woke up, I would still have all my own money
back.</p>

<p class=dream>Hahah joke's on him!  I paid him three bucks and woke
up.</p>

<p>I have to P, but all the doors are closed in te back area; I'm not
sure which is the restroom.</p>

<p class=date>8:53am</p>

<p>So I briefly met Linda, who got up just as I wrote the above
snippet.  I know which room is the restroom, and I must say, that was
my first guess.</p>

<p>Things I remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>Norma performed a wedding ceremony for me and Carolyn in the
dining room.</li>

<li>learning how to walk backwards on the sidewalk by my house (I saw
a kid do it and thought that was sooo cool!!  ("Look at that!  He's
walking <em>backwards</em>!"))</li>

<li>walking down to Noel's, a grocery store that was just too far for
me, David, *and* my little brother to walk.  It got dark and stormy
and Fred started to cry, then *I* started to cry, and I don't know if
David did or not.  Our parents had activated the entire neighborhood
posse to find us.  We got picked up by them pretty close to our
neighborhood again.</li>

<li>missing my ride to school one day; I wasn't ready yet when the
neighbors came to pick me up.  I remember being in my underwear (or
naked??) while looking out the window as they honked, wondering what
to do.  (old man voice: "yeahp, that was back before we had cell
phones!") They drove away and I knew what to do then: get dressed and
take a day off from school!  It was raining and the creek was gushing
a huge amount of water more than normal.  I am thankful for that
memory; I was amazed by that amount of water pouring out of the
concrete slab underneath the bridge.</li>

<li>My dad lifting me up onto the roof of our house (but I don't
remember why) and then me trusting that he would be strong enough to
help me back down again.  I was really scared to get down.</li>

<li>Going for walks around the block, and for bike rides around the
block, (oh, and seeing a guy ride his bike without using his hands!)
and me following my dad because I knew that *he* wouldn't do anything
unsafe or illegal so if I stayed right behind him I would be okay.  I
remember being confused a bit when he said something like, "well
that's not always true.."</li>

<li>Building a big snow turkey instead of a snowman in our front yard
(possibly around Thanksgiving)</li>

<li>The enormous snowman that someone had built in their yard - at
least 40 feet tall.  Maybe 20.  More than 10.</li>

<li>Learning how to write HTML and Perl. (oh wait, that was
later)</li>

<li>My dad telling me that he couldn't carry me on his shoulders
anymore when we walked.  That was another case of me learning my dad
wasn't flawless and blissful youth wouldn't last forever.</li>

<li>That the cat would sleep on top of the chimney during the winter
to stay warm</li>

<li>Learning what walnuts were (there's a walnut tree in a yard within
the block around which we would walk)</li>

<li>Playing awesome video games like, like, Pong, and then the
incredible Breakout.  wow.</li>

<li>Walking to and from school one day.</li>
</ul>

<p>This could go on forever.</p>

<p><p>Things I remember but haven&rsquo;t seen yet:
<ul>
<li>Apple tree in my back yard</li>
<li>Bushes in Norma&rsquo;s back yard where Carolyn and I played doctor</li>
<li>the terrain in their back yard, with grass on the right and garage
door on the left</li>
<li>the creek</li>
</ul></p>

<p>I'm going to go for a walk around the neighborhood now and see what
else I can see/do/remember.</p>

<p class=date>9:55am</p>

<p>This walk would be the perfect time for a dictation recorder, as
suggested by Steve, who I met as part of the production crew for Dirty
Third II.</p>

<p>I'm sitting at the top of the hill down which Fred and I would sled
in the snowy winters (me on the sled and him on my back).  The hill is
so not tall that I said, "oh.. my.. god..." at how not tall it is.  I
mean it's probably 200 feet long and drops in elevation about 40 feet
(about the height of one snowman), but it's not the precipice (sp) one
might see in Calvin and Hobbes, as it was back in the day.  Okay, not
scary back in the day, but worthy of sledding down multiple times.</p>

<p>I'm going to walk down to the creek now.</p>

<p>Oh, for the record, the tree under which I am sitting has firey red
leaves on the tips of its branches.  The rest of the leaves are still
green.</p>

<p class=date>10:06am</p>

<p>The creek, however, is just the right size, shape, and depth.  I
can see evidence of its flood levels consistent with my memory of that
rainy flooded (non) schoolday.  This is just right.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Woah.  This lake was not here.  I walked upstream and past Broadway
it's a lake instead of whatever it was.  Not a lake, but a creek going
through the middle of nothing.</p>

<p class=date>10:58am</p>

<p>I'm walking around the block now, and have discovered a house for
sale that was built in 1960 according to the literature.  I remembered
the two ex-deadends on the block (they were originally circles at the
end of the street, but now the street goes through).  But I'm writing
because I have just witnessed history in the making with a guy laying
bricks on his home just at the corner of Crestland and Stewart.  At
the top of the T intersection.  Fourteen bricks are layed so far.</p>

<p class=date>11:26am</p>

<p>Have just spoken with Brenda at D&H, the drugstore I remember so
well.  Well, maybe not so well, but well enough to know that the door
used to be on the east side of the building instead of the south, and
that the front counter was just to the left as one walked in.  (The
counter is on the left of the entrance again, but since the entrance
moved, the counter moved.)</p>

<p>She seemed really fascinated with my story and encouraged me to
write to the Tribune about my experiences re-visiting the place.  I
wonder if I'll do that.  Super thanks to Brenda for being so
supportive and blessing my adventure.</p>

<p>She gave me a phone book to look up Ridgeway Elementary, where I
used to attend school.  Gave me directions to it as well.</p>

<p>I'm going to walk there, oh and I want to walk to see if Noel's is
still there.  I'm guessing I'm spelling that name incorrectly.</p>

<p class=date>11:39am</p>

<p>Walking down West Boulevard now, and I remember these houses that I
found so mysterious back in the day, for they have no walkway between
their doors and the sidewalk.  They are The Village Apartments, and
these doors are the <em>back</em> doors; the parking lot and front
doors are on the other side.  Mystery solved!</p>

<p class=date>11:45am</p>

<p>I talked with peeps at the front desk of the elementary school on
West Blvd, and asked if they had heard of Busy Bee preschool, cause
that's where I went to preschool.  It's not listed in the phone
book.</p>

<p>Ah well, some things were bound to change. ;-)  I wonder if Noel's
is still there.</p>
