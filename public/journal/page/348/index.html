<p>Fuck. I'm again stuck in Tangent Mode, where I distract myself with
everything and spend more time wondering what is the best thing to do
than in actually doing something.</p>

<p>For example, right now I'm thinking I should define Tangent Mode on
my WTF pages, cause they haven't seen any action for a while, but are
given a headlining role on my site.  But I've just finished my SF
pages, and they don't even appear on my navigation.  So is it better
to fuck with putting SF on my navigation or add Tangent Mode to my WTF
or to go teach Akisan whose lesson starts in 33 minutes?</p>

<p>Does everyone go through tangent mode?  How does my tangent mode
compare to others'?  How can this be measured?</p>

<p>Shit I gotta go.</p>

<p class=date>5:44pm</p>

<p>Wende knows me really well and I really feel blessed by her.</p>

<p>She happened to send me an email while I continued to be in Tangent
Mode after my lesson with Aki in Tsunashima.  Since she was awake I
called her all HI at first and wondered if she knew what kinda of
digital camera I should get to interview myself about my friend's
friend whose birthday is coming up and in the back of my mind I knew I
shouldn't be applying such effort and resources to such a tangential
project, but I just want to be FAMOUS and produce the BEST, FUNNIEST,
self-interview EVER, starring myself as the interviewer and myself as
the interviewed, with different backgrounds and activities going on
for each question.  I basically wanted to put hundreds of hours of
work into this project but I'm like fucking what the fuck is going on
with that; I just want so much to be the Star of everyone's lives.  I
want to be the absolute best at everything I do.  I want to thrill and
amaze and encourage and inspire, and I want this to be enough for
people to throw me the money I need to live and travel and do anything
I want in the world.  And I want to do all of this absolutely with no
help from anyone else at all in the entire world.  And I want people
to adore me so thoroughly that they will research and write my
biography for me.</p>

<p>Soon enough just cried cried cried cause I don't know what the fuck
I'm doing in Japan and Wende just listened and listened.</p>

<p>She helped me release this maniacal idea of being the star of K's
birthday party: I barely know this person and it's not appropriate to
be the star of her show. Actually I realized that myself and Wende
suggests that a year ago I wouldn't have recognized that.</p>

<p>Growth is happening.</p>

<p>But true to my adage, living life is slower than reading
biographies and this growth is slow as fuck!</p>

<p>Release.</p>

<p>I feel better.</p>

<br>Dear Rob,<br>
<br>
I did not get a chance to read more of your journal today, but that&rsquo;s okay because I&rsquo;m enjoying the suspense.  I am at the part where you asked Wende to marry you.  At first, this came as quite a shock. I have thought about you off and on through the years, and, in a way, you always represented the &ldquo;care-free, no-extraneous-responsibilites, live-off-the-land&rdquo; kind of guy that I dreamed was the ideal mode of travel here on this earth.  So, I was like &ldquo;Woah, Dude!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I know that you are in Japan as I type, so things between April 2000 and the present are a mystery. I am looking forward to discovering how everything has played out.<br>
<br>
See you,<br>
Gary <br>
<br>
P.S. I am wondering how many frisbees you took to Japan.<br>
<br></p>

<p><em>perfect</em> timing leaving the lunch place to catch my train
on time.  And I was all nervous about it at first, but *bang* I was
spot on.  (I'm picking up several idioms from Cory)</p>

<p>Today was our last class with Hososensei for three weeks.  We'll
meet her on 5 Aug, 9 Aug and then again in September.  Olivia bought
her a gift.</p>

<p>I'm putting the word out that I want Japanese roommates.</p>

<p>During class I found it apparent that I hadn't been studying.   I
also see what Cory is talking about with too much TTT Teacher Talk
Time.  I used to talk too much in my Nova classes, but I'm shifting to
a much lower percentage.  We had a fantastic class yesterday that
featured very little TTT.</p>

<p>Hososensei explains stuff instead of letting us practice it.  I
have done the same thing.</p>

Cors,

Thank you for your input.   I have spent the evening reading the
techniques you gave me and I've decided I can stay in Kawasaki.

haha actually that's not true.   I will stay in Kawasaki, but I didn't
read the techniques.  (promise)

I try to live my life by chasing my dream and walking through my fears
instead of seeking the easy way out.

Therefore, I have decided two things, the second of which scares the
fuck out of me, so I know it must be a good idea.

1) I will stay in Kawasaki Nova

2) I want to have Japanese roommates.  I want to immerse myself more
in the culture.  I want to move around mid-October, so Janette can
stay with me at my old (current) apartment when she visits.

I came to Japan to learn Japanese.  If I am more immersed, I'll
certainly learn more, presumably be happier overall, and intend for
that happiness to overflow into my work.

<p>I'm still awake.  Actually I took a nap for a couple hours, but I
wonder how I'll feel when I need to be awake in some hours.  I've been
working on my site, and have restructured how the navigation files are
called; I found out how to send parameters to indicate which page is
calling the cgi file.  So now instead of having a bunch of separate
.pl files I have one file that reads the params.. much simpler.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>

<p>ps: it's light outside.  as in, daylight.</p>

<p>On the train next to a cat from Tanzania.</p>

<p>He's been in Japan for 10 years.  Is taking 2 weeks off from work
cause he broke his arm in a car accident.  Talked about how safe Japan
is compared to big T and how some Japanese are afraid of foreigners.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>A little girl with her mom on the previous train was mimicking the
announcer's voice as we approached the station: "Hiyoshi.  Hiyoshi
des."  (Hiyoshi; this is Hiyoshi)  In her little girl voice it was
really cute.</p>

<p>Japanese is a cool language cause it doesn't waste time with little
words.</p>

<p>Just left work; I'm on the train in Kawasaki station.  Chatted with
Sumika and a perpetual 7A student who has been stuck there for eh ver.
He asked her about leveling up and as I was sliding out the door she
basically asked if I could help her counsel him and I'm thinking sure
thing; anything for you.  And I yammered with him for a bit, basically
telling him that his grammatical structure is all over the place, and
until he cleans that up, plus uses the correct tenses for past,
present, future constructions, he'll be stuck in 7A.</p>

<p>He seemed quite good natured about it, working hard to correct
errors he was making even as I spoke with him.  Then the three of us
were talking again and he continued to work hard to correct the
sentences he was messing up.  It was almost comical, well it was cause
he wasn't all upset or anything.</p>

<p>I ushered him out since Sumika was not getting any of her end of
day work done while talking with us, though apparently she had a
Japanese responsibility to yammer with us while we were there.</p>

<p>I wanted to chat with her on the train (we're both on Nambu line)
on the way home, but for the second week my plan was foiled again.</p>

<p>It's cool though; I broke up with her tonight; turns out she's only
22.</p>

Cors,

Thank you for your input.   I have spent the evening reading the
techniques you gave me and I've decided I can stay in Kawasaki.

haha actually that's not true.   I will stay in Kawasaki, but I didn't
read the techniques.  (promise)

I try to live my life by chasing my dream and walking through my fears
instead of seeking the easy way out.

Therefore, I have decided two things, the second of which scares the
fuck out of me, so I know it must be a good idea.

1) I will stay in Kawasaki Nova

2) I want to have Japanese roommates.  I want to immerse myself more
in the culture.  I want to move around mid-October, so Janette can
stay with me at my old (current) apartment when she visits.

I came to Japan to learn Japanese.  If I am more immersed, I'll
certainly learn more, presumably be happier overall, and intend for
that happiness to overflow into my work.

 "So much like the time so long ago when Gary Strouz and I had slid
 down that hill on our butts during a sudden rainstorm while we had
 been playing disc golf."

<br>Why do certain images remain with us through the years, while other perfectly good ones evaporate away like the morning dew?  Two memories from that day in Hermann Park still invade my daydreams: Sliding down that muddy hill in the rain, and wading out into the &ldquo;reflection&rdquo; pond to retrieve an errantly thrown frisbee, mud oozing between the toes.<br>

You do realize that you are phucking nuTz, don&rsquo;t you?</p>
