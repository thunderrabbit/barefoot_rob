<p>The GoFundme text is not finished yet, but I plan to finish it up
tonight or tomorrow.</p>

<p>It took a while to get this version complete, including breaking a pen
and crying my eyes out with Mark at the Jonathan&rsquo;s near <ruby><rb>向ヶ
丘遊園駅</rb><rt><ruby><rb>むこうがおかゆうえんえき
</rb><rt>mukogaokayuen station</rt></ruby></rt></ruby>.</p>

<p>Between working for TY and AB, I got this version complete in one
take, after about 30 takes over a period of a week or so.</p>

<p>I wrote a post on Hugo forums to find a site designer who can make a
nice design for Marble Track 3.  As of this writing, the website uses
my tweak of Castanet, and looks like this
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190111132634/https://www.marbletrack3.com/">Marble Track 3 site v2 (via archive.org)</a></p>

<p>Because the project takes some time to explain, I want the website to
quickly give people an overview, and allow people to click in to get
more details if they like.</p>

<p>One designer replied to my Hugo post.  We had a chat and this is their
first design iteration.
<a href="https://www.deligence.com/clients/marbletrack3/">https://www.deligence.com/clients/marbletrack3/</a>   I made a rough copy
here <a href="https://vigilant-mayer-608cf8.netlify.com/">https://vigilant-mayer-608cf8.netlify.com/</a></p>

<p>One thing Jimmy noted was they used a hexagon motif where circles
would be more appropriate.  I spent a couple hours trying to reverse
engineer SVG paths</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://svghelper.com/">https://svghelper.com/</a> for helping me create this shape</p>

<p>I sent this response</p>

<pre><code>HI Sanjay

Thank you for the design.

I really like the video embedded in the header graphic, but it seems too dark to me; can it be made somewhat lighter color?

I like that the site is responsive.

Easy changes:

1a) The VIDEO section should be directly below &quot;These guys are great!
Just look at them go!&quot;.  So please swap the order of OUR WORKERS to be
below VIDEO

1b) remove rectangle from around VIDEO section so it will seem
connected to above text &quot;Look at them go!&quot;

2a) In the TRACK (PARTS) section, the Made by sections should not have
a space before the colon (&quot;Made by: &quot; is correct)

2b) In the TRACK (PARTS) section, there should be no space before
commas after workers names (&quot;Dr Sugar, Mr McGlue, Squarehead&quot; is
correct)

3) My friend made a rough logo that can replace the four circles logo.
He will simplify it so it works at a small size

<pre><code>Harder changes

4) Please add a placeholder for the language selection.  There should
be two languages for now: English and Japanese

5) The hexagon theme doesn't make sense with the marbles; can the
theme be round instead of hexagons?  Here are some examples of
unnecessary hexagons, but there are many
more. https://www.deligence.com/clients/marbletrack3/images/hexline_2.png

<pre><code>5 suggestion (easy change)) For the workers, perhaps above could be
approximately this shape

&lt;/svg&gt;

6) Anchors in the top right for Twitter, Youtube, Github are too wide.
The anchors overlap so that when mouse cursor is over Twitter anchor,
the Youtube anchor is active.

<pre><code>7) FYI: The current site has no Javascript, so the new site should
still work without javascript.  (no fancy graphics need without
Javascript, but the site should work Web 1.0 if javascript is off)

8) There are many errors in browser console.  Please remove or repair the broken code

9) How do you plan to receive feedback from users?  This site will be
hosted on Netlify.

10) OUR WORKERS section should be dynamically generated so as I add
more workers, they will show up on the top page in OUR WORKERS
section.

best regards
Rob

<p>今朝テストしながら、仕事のお客様に電話もらいました。「あの、サイトにロー
ギンできない、また。」</p>

<p>気分は良くなってなりました。「すみませんでした、すぐに直します。」</p>

<p>すぐに直しましたけど「また」って。それは問題です。なんでそのサイトはす
ぐにダウンです？</p>

<p>One of the AB cronjobs has been throwing errors, but the job is still
running.</p>

<p>I am in the middle of refactoring the code to use Dependency
Injection; I don&rsquo;t know how I broke something, but I cannot really go
back to a previous version.  Rather, I don&rsquo;t know what version to go
back to, and my local dev environment cannot recreate the error.</p>

<p>Annoyingly, my local dev environment cannot even access Ye Olde
Interneffe so I cannot easily revert local files to a previous state
anyway.</p>

<pre><code>both frontend and backend use Localizer::getInstance in these
classes. Inject it instead of reference Singleton

./Data/Unit.php
./DeviceHandler.php
./SiteHandler.php
./Template.php
./Translator.php
</code></pre>

<p>I am in the middle of doing <code>\Data\Unit</code>.  Perhaps once I finish that,
I can push, deploy, and pray.</p>

<p>There are 19 more places to change instantiations of <code>\Data\Unit</code>,
including in <code>\Factory\UnitFactory</code>.</p>

<p>I am curious if I misread or misunderstood the MLAPHP book which said
we are making small incremental changes.  This little change seems to
have blown up a bit, due to classes which instantiate <code>\Data\Unit</code> and
should eventually have its dependencies injected into them as well.</p>

<p>Men,</p>

<p>Back when I joined Mankind Project in 1997, the New Warrior Training
Adventure was the only way to get started in Mankind Project.</p>

<p>Attending the weekend was a life changing experience for me.  It was
on that weekend that I realized I was a man.  It was during that
weekend that I began to get over my fear of men.</p>

<p>Over the years, as an organization, Mankind Project has begun
encouraging new men to sit in Open Circles (like the one we have in
Tokyo) before attending the New Warrior Training Adventure (NWTA).</p>

<p>I believe the NWTA is still a life changing experience, even after you
have been sitting in an open circle.  Over the course of the weekend,
there is more time to really get into the work than we can in 2 hours.</p>

<p>Anyway, I very rarely do anything like sales pitches in the meetings.
I assume you cannot go.  I assume you are not interested.  I assume
all sorts of things that stop me from inviting you.</p>

<p>I hereby invite you to challenge me on Tuesday if I do not bring up
the NWTA coming up in Hawaii, March 29th - 31st.</p>

<p>I also hereby invite you to join me in Hawaii for the NWTA, March
29th - 31st.  I will be on staff, and look forward to seeing you there.</p>

<p>Is this the time for you? I don&rsquo;t know.  But if you are interested,
start here: <a href="https://nwta.mkp.org/">https://nwta.mkp.org/</a></p>

<p>Today was a long day, starting with recording a first draft of a video
for my first GoFundMe campaign, then two TY lessons, two MKP meetings,
lunch with Tomoko, then an hour chillin with &ldquo;a flower in each hand&rdquo;
behind the desk of the Sweets Party Attendants, having a non-lesson
with them because they have nothing going on.</p>

<p>During this non-lesson, Tomoko showed me her &ldquo;personal こたつ&rdquo; which
consisted of a heater under her desk and a blanket strategically
arranged to drape down over her legs.  I showed them the latest MT3
video clip,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&amp;video_id=OHCg01--Zsc">cut and glued 7th outer spiral support</a>.
M&rsquo;s comment was (something like) 「思ったより短い」(but she translated
it as &ldquo;not as much progress as I expected&rdquo;, so I know my adjective is
wrong in Japanese).  Tomoko said she would work on translating more of
the website.  I knew I was stretching it to invite her to (create a
Github account, learn git and) do pull requests (but I tried anyway,)
and when she saw the source code of a page she commented 「難しい！」
so I apologized and thanked her for anything she could do.</p>

<p>Then headed to JB where we practiced &ldquo;Happy New Year&rdquo; with kids
lessons and played a variant of UNO targeting adjectives, animal
names, body parts, and a
couple semantic rules:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see a red nose; I play a red dog&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then with the adults in my 8pm class things like &ldquo;I see a reindeer
with brown antlers; I play a tiger standing in front of brown trees&rdquo;
and culminating with Hide&rsquo;s &ldquo;I see an elephant standing on yellow sand
and wearing a yellow ribbon; I play an elephant standing on yellow
sand and wearing a yellow ribbon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then with the adults in my 9pm class all calling in absent, I got to
head home early.  I am one station from Noborito now when the class
would just be finishing.</p>

<h5 id="21-56-wednesday-09-january-2019-jst">21:56 Wednesday 09 January 2019 JST</h5>

<p>And now I would be just a station or two from Noborito, but Lin and I
are home.  yay!</p>
