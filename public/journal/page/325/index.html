bath/shower room in my apartment is cramped, but has a cool feature.
The shower can spray in the bathtub *or* all over the floor and no one
minds.</p>

<p>janette likes to take baths.  She filled the tub most of the way.
When I got in, the water went nearly to the top of the tub.  We
splashed like little kids and yelled, "you kids stop splashing water!"
"Josephine!  I mean it!"</p>

<p>"Mom!  She splashed water all over the floor!"  "No I didn't.  It
was his fault!"</p>

<p>I lifted myself partway out of the tub and turned the water on
until it was brimming and turned it off.</p>

<p>"Ready?"</p>

<p>I was surprised that she didn't see this next part coming.  I sank
down into the water, causing a tsunami over the edge of the tub.
janette giggled like when I say something funny.</p>

<p>"I'm telling mom."</p>

moved into my room (wow I already called it my room instead of Frank's
old room) there was a mattress underneath which were two futon
under-mattress things.  This setup worked fine until janette crammed
me against the freezing cold wall in the middle of the night.  Because
the futon undermattress things are thinner than the mattress mattress,
it sloped over top of them, making a gravity well that pushed me
further against the wall.</p>

<p>At work on Saturday, I realized I could use the under-futon-mattri
as bumpers around the big mattress.  Works beautifully.</p>

<p>Finish.  Arigato.</p>

<p>I'm really thankful to have been the first person to do my speech,
so I could get that shit over with and just smile and not understand
all the other speeches.</p>

<p>Before the speech, I sat beside Gergana in the line-up of chairs
next to the podium.  Nervously joked about different shit, for example
when the MC was up there reading her pre-speech-yammer (turn off yer
cell phones, ya rude cheeky monkeys), I leaned over to Gergana like,
"here ya go," mock handing my speech to the woman, "you can read mine
while you're at it."  hahaha.  whatever.</p>

<p>But the best was when I rubbed my sweaty palms on my shorts and
looked over at janette and said "palms are sweaty knees weak arms are
heavy theres vomit on his sweater already mom's spaghetti."   She
goes, "I dare you."</p>

<p>HAHAHAhaahhahahaha  oh yeah that would be a riot.</p>

<p><em>he's nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop
bombs but he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down the whole crowd
goes so loud he opens his mouth but the words won't come out he
chokin' how everybody's jokin' now the clocks run out time's up over
blaow snap back to reality</em> oh shit I better be ready for my
speech instead of Eminem.</p>

<p>Huge effort to make myself get up; it's like fuck am I supposed to
get up now?  how about now? Suddenly reached over and squeezed
Gergana's hand for good luck.  Uh oh I'm up.  Where do I stand?  Every
action must be flawless; every person is looking at *me*.  To make it
challenging, the beginning of my speech was slightly changed (not
verbally, but physically) because Hoso asked me to refer to a map
during my introduction to point out America (pssh) and Texas on a map.
That flubbed my first couple lines a bit but I got past it and I think
I said everything on my speech.  I know I made a particle error in my
memorized part and made some what-the-hell-do-I-say-now errors in the
partially memorized part (shoulda learned how to say in Japanese, "who
wrote this?" for a laugh), but instead I said, "it's true," as filler
when I paused ("whatever the hell I just said is completely true");
some lines I had total brainlock and Hoso helped me through.</p>

<p>One good thing is the sound quality sucked as the microphone and
amplifiers gave some awesome squealing feedback.  I had enough
presence to turn off the mic to solve it as the squeaks were tweaked.
The suck-sound took away some of my nervousness; that was one thing I
couldn't control, so I was able to release it.</p>

<p>Another good thing was a woman in the audience smiling at me.  I'm
still loved no matter what.</p>

<p>In the end, I think I finished the last line correctly: "If you
come to Texas, please have fun."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I think Gergana was the only presenter to have memorized her entire
speech.  A couple of speechers (making the audience speechees) simply
read their speeches.  One cat read his in a way that made me think he
hadn't read it before.  That's what romaji is for, man.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>After the speeches, Kaori came up to me and congratulated me on
finishing and said sorry for not having seen it.  I'm really thankful
for her support.</p>

<p>Then it was time to chow, though I wanted nothing more than to jump
over a mountain with all my pent up nervous energy.  We sat cordially
and thankfully with Hoso and friends.  We were blessed with food and I
received some positive feedback on my speech.  High vocabulary.
Tight.</p>

<p>janette and I escaped to a nearby park.</p>

<br>Hey, Rob:<br>
<br>
It&rsquo;s funny that you were saying, &ldquo;come to Texas and have some fun&rdquo; in your speech.  I&rsquo;m actually going to be getting out of Texas for awhile.  I&rsquo;m not one for conservative states.  I plan on going to New Mexico.<br>
<br>
I understand how you feel giving speeches.  I was encouraged recently to teach meditation, but came up with an excuse (actually pretty good one) because talking in front of everyone makes me nervous.  <br>
<br>
Hope this last week went well for you,<br>

<p>Rode up a pretty steep hill next to Ookurayama station.  hey I
wonder if the yama in the name is a reference to the hill.</p>

<p>I feared for janette's safety wooshing down the hill on the other
side, but she was fine.</p>

<p>Quite a beautiful area.   I had been there once before, but then we
went left where I had previously gone right, and it was all new to
both of us.</p>

<p>First person at work today = me (except for Sumika and Masayo).
That's good because I left a bit later than planned, in a bit of a
mussed rush this morning.  Super fast over the bridge.  Very short
waiting times at both train stations.</p>

Greetings Robert,

My name is M____. Through a very convoluted path of
rumors and faxes I found your website by request of my Japanese wife.
Journal entry 12:19 am JST Friday 26 September 2003 is making its
rounds! Apparently there is a pissed off mother who ready your
message and interpreted it as unprofessional.... unbelievable.

I've been in Japan eight years, and it still baffles me how bent out
of shape things can get over small things like celphones and
translater devices.

Anway, if it's worth anything at all....

I FEEL FOR YOU!!

Read your resume before writing you. I admire your objective, and
respect your background and activities. I hope we can open a
dialogue. I don't plan on being in Japan too much longer, but you
seem to be a very interesting person so I just couldn't resist writing
you.

Here is a little about me.. don't have a website to share with you,
journal or resume.... but this article kind of gives you an idea of
me..

* redacted * (they were 404 anyway)

Anyway, please this email between us...

Best Regards, M

the kitchen, *and* replaced the light over the toilet.  all in one
day.  Wow.</p>

<p>janette gave me space to work on my speech, but I had trouble
staying focused.  Liz called me this morning to see if my speech is
okay and I just left a message back with her.  Hoso called me this
morning and said I need to be at the lounge at 9:45 (moved up from
10:10 (which I was just going to make 10 anyway)) at which time she
will help me (hopefully in a non-frustrating manner (I choose my own
reaction, but we'll see how genki I feel about my speech when I work
on it with her)) study for it.</p>

<p>I am the first speech giver.  Awesome.  If I feel like dying after
my speech we can just leave.</p>

<p>Wooooo</p>

<p>Awesome.   Put my bike together tonight and rode around with
janette.  Saw Jon M (who is living with Olivia and Jen for his last
few days in Japan) on the way out of Bell Wistaria.  My bike felt
weird at first, but by the end of the evening, while janette was stuck
in a median waiting for highway traffic to go by, I zoomed up over and
down the highway on the pedestrian ramp thing.</p>

<p>Supazoomed down the hill into Tarumachi.   It ruled.  I'm *really*
happy to have my bike here in Japan.</p>
