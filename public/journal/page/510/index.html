Your most recent issue includes the term "commodity computing power," which
reminds me of a (true) story.

I was walking across University of Houston campus and found a small
calculator floating in the water fountain.  It weighs less than one ounce,
and after all the water dried out of the calculator, it works well.  It
supports operations + - / * % and square root.

I realized an amazing thing.  In not so many years, I will find computers
floating in the UH fountain with as much computing power as an expensive
computer today.

- - -

According to <a href="https://www.datamath.org/Story/Datamath.htm#The
Cal-Tech
Project">"https://www.datamath.org/Story/Datamath.htm#The Cal-Tech
Project"</a> one of the first calculators weighed 55 pounds and cost $2500
in
1965.  (they didn't do square root, though)

According to <a
href="https://eh.net/ehresources/howmuch/dollar_question.php">https://eh.net/e
hresources/howmuch/dollar_question.php</a> $2500 in
1965 had the same purchasing power as $14000 today.

SO in the equivalent of 35 technology-years (Moore's law, etc) I will find
floating in a water fountain the processing power of a computer that costs
$14,000 today.

Wowza!

        Thanks for your continued research!
        - Rob

<p>Last night Wende and I went to see <em>Lord of the
Rings</em> but the show was sold out at least 30
minutes early (7pm show), so we saw <em>Harry Potter
and the Sorcerer's Stone</em> instead.  I hadn't seen
it.  I pretty much entirely enjoyed it.  I'm happy for
the three young stars of the show.  I understand this
is the debut on the big screen for each of them.</p>

<p>'I shouldn't have told you that,' by Haggis (sp)
over and over was pretty funny.</p>

<p>Snape (Alan Rickman) reminded me a lot of Trent
Reznor's face.  I haven't seen images of Reznor in a
while though.</p>

<p>Went to sleep a bit after 9pm; woke up at 5:30; I'm at work now.
Rode my bicycle here, and it's pretty cold outside.  Around 35 degrees
I'm guessing.</p>

<p>Jennifer just sent me a link to <a
href='https://www.foundmagazine.com'>foundmagazine.com</a>, which seems
to be a bizarre little site with pics of things people found. I'm not
sure if the site is so small because they are picky about what they
display, or because it's just getting started.</p>

<p>I'm going to send a pic of the calculator I found floating in the
water at Cullen Fountain.</p>

<p>Wende and I are about to go see Lord of the Rings.  The movie is
nearly 3 hours long!!</p>

<p>I'll let you know how I like it.</p>

<p>Last night after Harry Potter, Wende and I visited
Dude's house and saw some of the scenes from the riots
and craziness in Argentina.  I feel so thankful that
we are not experiencing the horror of war and rioting
and masses of anger trashing a palace, etc.  So very
thankful.</p>

<p>However, I feel sad that I don't really have any
idea why people are angry in Argentina.</p>

<p>I think I know a bit about the Afghanistan
situation, but not all that much.  Currently our news
has been reporting that 7000 al Queda are captured,
and they are scouring caves where Osama bin Laden and
his peeps may have been chillin' (not quite the right
word, but I don't know what they were doing, or if
they were actually there.)</p>

<p>It's apparently been 101 days since the World Trade
towers were spanked.  Ceremonies and such yesterday.

<p class=date>7:02pm CST Wednesday 19 December 2001</p></p>

<p>After work today Erika, Courtney and I visited Paint This! and I
got to see my plate for Wende (I love it!) and start a new plate.
Courtney painted a poinsetta onto a soap dispenser while Erika painted
a pink flamingo on a blue background with yellow rim plate.  Courtney
finished her poinsetta quickly and began painting a blue ribbon on a
broken square plate.</p>

<p>On the way out we saw a tile on display which was painted just like
Erika's flamingo.  Same stencil and colors and everything.  :-)
Funny.</p>

<p>During our painting, I remembered that I forgot to go see <em>Lord
of the Rings</em> with Dude.  I paged him via text pager and he
replied that they were already at the theater.  He had called my cell
phone and home phone but no answer.</p>

<p><em>My cell phone?  I didn't hear it ring.  Hey, where is my cell
phone?</em></p>

<p>So I came back to work to find my phone, didn't find it but wrote
this entry.  I'm not concerned that I lost it; certainly it's at
home.</p>

<p>Entirely prepared to test all the G3 projects, but as I was
preparing, our T1 line went dead.  Fuck.  So I spent over an hour on
the phone with Amy at our isp (SAVVIS, who is soon to be our ex-isp)
who had me try to ping and traceroute different shit, but to no
avail.</p>

<p>During this time I had to cancel lunch with Jason, which sucks
because we had to cancel yesterday, and he's busy tomorrow.  I think
we'll get to go on Thursday.</p>

<p>I maintained my sanity by chilling at lunch with peeps in the break
room.  By the time lunch was over, the problem was fixed.  Something
on SAVVIS's end.  I don't know what yet.  They don't know what yet; I
just called them to ask.</p>

<p>So we're back online, and I showed Erika how to help me test the G3
projects, and then a client wanted to kick off their survey now, so I
was on the phone with him for an hour and five minutes showing him how
all the shit worked, and it was all good, and we just sent out 18
emails to participants in the class, and 2 bounced, 4 gave out of
office replies.  66% success rate.  Whatever.</p>

<p>Another survey is supposed to go online soon.  I feel trapped
(?).. scrambling to keep up.  I don't seem to write code and be
project manager at the same time very effectively.  And I'm hungry.
When is dinner?</p>

<p>My plate is finished at Paint This!  Go by the store (2511 Rice
Blvd just east of Kirby) and see my plate in the window!  How will you
know which one it is?  It's the one that looks like a paint explosion.</p>

<p>I haven't seen it yet since it was fired.  I'll give it to Wende
for Christmas, so go see it this week.</p>

<p>Oh, I'll scan a pic of it as well.</p>

<p>I've finally figured out a systematic way to test all my changes
before I move everything online.  I'm implementing that now.  It feels
good to actually get something done.</p>

<p>Also today I've been in touch with Kristen's mom, who is interested
in purchasing our house!  Quite exciting news, not just that it will
stay within my extended family, but that there is so much interest.
I'm thankful that it's selling so easily.  :-)</p>

<p>I've been working a bit on Kim's website, getting his sci-fi
samples moved online.  I'm using the same perl engine as I did for the
poetry page.</p>
