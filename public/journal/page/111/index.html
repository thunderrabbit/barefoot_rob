<p>Okay so for a long time I have used &ldquo;I-group&rdquo; or igroup or some
variant to describe my men&rsquo;s circle.  This nomenclature might be
confusing, so I shall now call it Integration Group.</p>

<p>Bleary eyed wake up with <a href="https://wiki.robnugen.com/wiki/Items:Noisy">Noisy</a> at 5:30am.</p>

<p>Was genki and dancing around by 6am to wake up Lin.</p>

<p>cold cold walk to station and caught 6:?? train then in Kawasaki by
7:30 for my 7:50 lesson.</p>

<p>Online I-group after the lesson featured lots of disconnects by the
free wifi provided by Wired Cafe.  But free, for the price of lunch.</p>

<p>Bought a trackball mouse afterward.  It works fine, though I do not
have a name for it yet.</p>

<p>Had a snooze on the train to Akihabara, and am now here at conveni
across the street from my lesson at 6:30pm.</p>

<p>Oh, on the way here I messaged a man who lives in Tokyo.  He said he&rsquo;d
be interested in our local I-group.  yay!</p>

<p>At home, I set up a URL that I could reload repeatedly to process N
records at a time.  I logged in to the site on my phone and repeatedly
loaded it while walking to the train station, and now while on the
train, I just now used my phone&rsquo;s wifi tethering option to rerun a CSV
create script after all the records had been updated.  This was for AB
and I was able to send AB the CSV from report 216.</p>

<p>Crossing fingers the data is all correct. :-3</p>

<p>Yesterday was a holiday, and happily enough, I basically took the day
off.  The previous two days I had been up working until an average of
4am.</p>

<p>Today I just read HN and now about to work on Ansible playbooks again.</p>

<p>But first, a silly thing I just made up:</p>

<pre><code>A: 鍵はどこかな?
B: 車内じゃない？

<p>(written 13:37 Saturday 18 March 2017 JST)</p>

<p>Last night I met Kai and Mika 久しぶり！We met near Mika&rsquo;s work for
dinner (I got lost on the way due to trusting Google maps which had
been given incorrect input, and ended up taking a taxi (only 410 yen
(wow!)) after realizing I had walked wayy off course) and then got ice
cream whereupon they suggested I do something crazy.</p>

<p>In July, there will be an event where untrained people can <em>conduct</em>
an orchestra!</p>

<p>My first reaction is holy shit no way because I have no idea what I&rsquo;m
doing everyone will laugh it will suck&hellip; wait a minute.  where is all
this fear coming from?</p>

<p>I trust Kai and Mika.  They say it will be fun so by golly I am going
to apply!</p>

<ol>
<li>The US shifted their clocks forward, so my online I-group now meets at 9:30am Tokyo time.  That means I do not have enough time to head home before the meeting, and that means I need to find Wifi.  I&rsquo;ve been using Wired Cafe in Lazona, and I will probably resume.  It also means I have my computer with me for this morning lesson to which students are often late.</li>
<li>Been doing lots of work for AB.  Added a field.. actually split a field into two pieces.  I thought date_available and date_marketable were the same.  False.  Well they have been the same in the DB for 6 years, so kinda true.</li>
<li>While doing all that work, I should be preparing to move them to Ubuntu 16.04</li>
<li>Apparently the CB project will end in June.  I hope it&rsquo;s not foolish to hope it&rsquo;s conceivable that it could possibly go smoothly.  Just sayin&rsquo; I miss having a project manager who can push back against certain requests.</li>
<li>I just taught a trial lesson yesterday for It&rsquo;s Me.  They were beginners, but genki and tried pretty hard.  First lesson starts a month from now; have to wait for new annual business cycle to start.</li>
<li>I gave a copy of Simon&rsquo;s book to Patrick.</li>
<li>TY had a baby!</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been going to SOGO since like August 2016.  I just invited Menya to my HHS presentation on March 28th.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ll be presenting Head Heart and Soul on March 28th.  It&rsquo;s basically an introduction into the type of emotional clearing / personal growth we do in my men&rsquo;s group.</li>
<li>I built a cage with chopsticks to surround my glass desk with a protective cat shield.  Inside the cage (which can be easily removed by people with thumbs (haha, cat!)), I plan to make a marble track.  Expect it to start soon after April.</li>
<li>In addition to weekly online I-group, I attend monthly I-group council call (being the representative for all the I-group<del>s</del> in Japan), and monthly Community Growth call (being that Japan has only one I-group).</li>
<li>One of the things suggested by the Community Growth team is to have patience.</li>
<li>I have not been meditating regularly.</li>
<li>I just started bringing my disk to SOGO so we can throw a bit after workout.  Only one taker 12 days ago, but about 4 people this past Sunday.</li>
<li>Student just arrived 11 minutes late.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="18-08-thursday-16-march-2017-jst">18:08 Thursday 16 March 2017 JST</h2>

<ol>
<li>The morning weather was 2 degrees C, basically too cold for me to happily go barefoot, but it got up to 12 C today, which is relatively great barefoot weather.</li>
<li>I really enjoy teaching students who enjoy learning.  I wonder how long I can do it.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been watching Mythbusters on Netflix.  I&rsquo;m up to Season 4 now I think.  Interesting that Scottie just vanished from episodes, replaced by Grant without fanfare.  I hope she left on good terms.</li>

<p>Good morning!(?)  Wow sleepy.</p>

<p>Today is my first time to join the <del>international suppport
group</del> <ins>Global Support Team</ins> call.</p>

<p>I plan to ask how to find the best match for a sponsoring community.</p>

<pre><code>We might not use it, but will have people to contact, in case of
need choose community I feel will support me.

dont worry about upside down directions.  its about who I can get
support from energetically.  strongly consider making a connection
in not so distant future.

prioritize geography.  Hawaii, NZ
