                        <p>Hello</p>

<p>I have a rather large Hugo site which I have pared down into one bite sized repository.</p>

<p>I made some tweaks to the top page to only show Page type Blog (in content and in pagination)</p>

<p>There are also page type. journal which I would like to be displayed under /journal</p>

<p>This all worked a few versions of Hugo ago.</p>

<p>I upgraded Hugo to 0.58 recently and it stopped working.</p>

<p>Neither /blog nor /journal nor the top page show any content.</p>

<p>I think it just be related to ______
which says we have to use A instead of B.  I tried that but still no content was displayed.</p>

<p>Usually Lin checks in with me on her way home, but she has not checked
in with me yet.  I wrote this to Mark on LINE:</p>

<pre><code>23:00 barefoot Rob Nugen Just checking in now; Lin is not home and not answering her phone or LINE
23:01 barefoot Rob Nugen It's possible she is out with friends, but usually she tells me if she will be late
23:01 barefoot Rob Nugen I won't seriously worry until after last train
23:02 barefoot Rob Nugen I do not need any support now, but I will let you know if I do.
23:02 barefoot Rob Nugen I assume she will come home, so from your point of view please treat this as
                         no news is good news.  i.e no further updates from me means she came home fine.
</code></pre>

<h5 id="23-18">23:18</h5>

<p>She called me; she is fine, just was out with co-workers due to
someone&rsquo;s last day at work.</p>

<p>The reboot didn&rsquo;t help, but turning off one of my USB cameras helped.  Hard to know what is causing the issue.</p>

<p>Moe Joe.  AB server ELB is causing or revealing 502s.  Locally, I
rebooted my elderly Macbook and the USB cable is still not working.  I
reset the printer system and the printer still will not print.  I
tried to copy a document and the printer would not copy it.  And
latest version of Hugo is <em>not</em> creating my website subdirectories
(/journal or /blog).</p>

<p>(My printer&rsquo;s scan-to-server function is working, though.  yay!!)</p>

<p>Those are redacted instructions that showed AWS support that something

<p>M helped me activate tcpdump and we captured output while recreating
the error in different capacities.</p>

<p>I have just uploaded the access.log file and tcpdump files and several
log files from ELB.  They are going to dig through them to try to
figure out what is happening.  So so glad to have the support!</p>

<p>Had a great day yesterday at Yomiuriland with Bu and Yen.  We
pretty much rode everything, and I tried quite hard to ride without
shoes on anything, but was pretty much requested to put on shoes every
time.  I think I made it onto one ride (a kiddy ride) without shoes.
Oh and maybe the ferris wheel?</p>

<p>I did a little skit of Francois driving a gocart.</p>

</div>


<p>We also did the car making thing.</p>

<p>We did the spinning-till-ya-throwup teacups, spinning as fast as we
could.  That was great; I had not done that in a while!  Bu and I
did the bungee, but Yen was like &ldquo;yeah nah.  I&rsquo;ll take video of you
guys!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I recognized Kakashi, the juggler who I met at Grinpa, and got a
picture with him!</p>

<p>He did a crazy balancing thing I should have taken a photo of <em>that</em>.</p>

<p>We colored the tops of UFO ramen, which is great for taking back home,
but <em>we cannot eat the ramen</em> in the shop.</p>

<p>Bu and Yen bounced at 5pm and I stayed and went back to ride Crazy Hyuuuu
and Crazy Stoonn, and chatted with some peeps effectively enough that
they asked to get a picture with me.</p>

<p>Then saw Sami and Wilson who we had seen before but didn&rsquo;t talk to.  I
invited them to do the water raft slide thing; they enjoyed it enough
we rode twice!  Got a pic with them and exchanged info so we can keep
in touch!</p>

<p>Headed toward home on Nambu Line now after waking up at 4:30 (after
one sleep cycle) and doing my morning routine (write dreams, write
gratitude, meditate, brush teeth, etc) then headed to work in Kawasaki
for JB in Solid Square.  Sayuri came about 15 minutes late and was the
only student in attendance.</p>

<p>Headed to JR Kawasaki afterward to meet やなさん but he ended up
having to cancel for some reason.  I was a bit grouchy like why
couldn&rsquo;t he tell me ahead of time, but bah.</p>

<p>Got some food at a bakery and then headed to DiCE internet cafe and
slept for a couple of hours then ended up browsing Instagram and
clicking the little hearts because I heard that&rsquo;s what we gotta do
these days to make connections online.</p>

<p>After seeing Menya&rsquo;s post about too many calories, I was inspired to
have only one (1) cup of soft serve ice cream at the cafe (normally I
eat 3 or 4, easily).</p>

<p>Headed to JB school for kid lessons then adult lessons and wondered
about my place in my universe.  All the while, my blog entry is
brewing in my head.  I choose what I do (and no one else really
cares).  But I haven&rsquo;t really started the entry because of the message
in its title.</p>

<p>And also because my site is effed up now and I need to fix my theme to
work with latest version of Hugo (or something).</p>

<p>It looks like I am going to have to spend a day tracking down how to
make my site work again; I wrote to the main creator of Hugo, but no
reply.  When I posted on the forums last time, I ended up paying too
much for shoddy work that crept up in price.</p>

<p>Honored to be invited to the event! Admired that Rin has connected
lots of people who could easily become friends.</p>

<p>Upon arrival, Rin cried as Hiro predicted. Everyone had a great
time. I friended Chris just because he commented on the FB group.</p>

<p>Talked to him about PB 49 and 52, assuring him I could talk about it
all night (even though 13 years at wow)</p>

<p>Heard about Chris moving from China at age 10 to live in Cincinnati.</p>

<p>Last hug to Diana for now as she&rsquo;s about to head back to her country.
Got two cards from Sophia to hopefully introduce housing for her
company to find homestay families for youth.</p>

<p>Handed out my MKP Japan card like candy even though we are in a
digital world. Two women were like &ldquo;what about womankind project?&rdquo; so
I referred them to womanwithin.org.</p>

<p>Today I was five minutes late to (teach) my lesson with Yuna; I
excitedly told her about going to see
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/叶結
Kanauknot-2016891955206776/">叶結（Kanauknot)</a> today in 豊島園after having seen them in
ぐりんぱ.</p>

<p>I was so excited that I explained &ldquo;hh hh hh hh hh&rdquo;, from
<a href="https://thunderrabbit.com/castle/Dragon_run-way">The Castle of Dreams</a></p>

<p>I was so excited that for 30 minutes, this overshadowed my news about
having done my first stand up comedy last night after being invited by
Soness.</p>

<p>After talking about how Soness has been a great friend for years,
working as a performer (for English Carnival), speaker coach (for
various TED and TED-style events), and now beginning to explore stand
up comedy as a hobby, Yuna began to think about what it might be like
to have a hobby that could become a job.</p>

<p>I saw this in her expression and was like, &ldquo;I think you are thinking
about how you can make your hobby into a career&rdquo; and quickly rattled
off three ways I thought reading books could become a career.</p>

<ul>
<li>publisher</li>
<li>editor</li>
<li>audio book voice</li>
</ul>

<p>I was  surprised to hear Yuna  had heard that one  &ldquo;cannot enjoy their
job&rdquo;  or something.   I  thought  <em>Oh man  that  sounds like  terrible
advice!!!</em> and said &ldquo;well, I believe otherwise..&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the end, I used the question
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/niyaa.rn">Rin</a> gave me and invited Yuna to
think about what workshop she would <em>love</em> to present for people.  I
offered that it would likely fit well with Giselle&rsquo;s
<a href="https://www.meetup.com/English-coffee-more/">English&amp;Coffee + More!!</a>
meetup group.</p>

<p>Next lesson next week, much more space for Yuna to speak!</p>
