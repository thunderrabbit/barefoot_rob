<p>Just rode my bike around the park near Marta's house.  Wow it's hot
outside.  I haven't been exercising all that much lately and it seems
to show in my tiredness level in my legs.</p>

<p>I told Marta the story of my inline skating accident, including the
part where the nurse or doctor wondered if I was a long distance
runner given that my heartrate was about 40 beats per minute.  I love
that part of the story and am willing to work a bit to keep that up.</p>

<p>My roadtrip adventure begins soon, basically by this weekend.  I
feel sorta like I'm going on my first rally, or actually my second
because at the first rally I had no idea what to expect, but at my
second, I sorta kinda had an idea what to expect, but didn't really
know how to prepare for such awesomeness.</p>

<p>So I sorta kinda know what to expect, but I don't know what I need
to bring on my adventure.  I have decided to bring some things but
then the other things that I don't really want to take I'm not sure
what to do with them.  This is the exact same blues song that I was
wailing before SWUUSI as I was getting rid of my other stuff.</p>

<p>But I got rid of it and I was happier without it.  And some of that
which I have taken with me I have hardly touched.  Like my letter
writing materials.  And my box of miscellaneous stuff, that which I
just tossed into a box out of exasperation at the end of my panic
packing spree, intending to process it much sooner than now.</p>

<p>I've basically decided to take with me some clothes, my computer,
sleeping bag, pillow, backpack, pantry (box of non perishible foods),
library (small box of books) (maybe I should just take a few books
that I've actually been reading), </p>

<p>The rest I'm either going to store at Marta's or Bibby's, and some
of it I'm giving away.  Argh this is such a weird process.</p>

<p>Just watched <em>Rainman</em> on video.  I appreciate that they
didn't make it too Hollywood.  Tom Cruise didn't get into ridiculous
trouble at the casino; and something else didn't happen that would
have in a normal movie.  Yeah, Dustin Hoffman was pretty convincing as
well.</p>

<p>Just watched Chucky and two others test for their brown belt in
karate.  Pretty amazing stuff, and I might have gotten some good
pictures, but mly camera seems to be having a few problems.  I'm glad
I got the 3 year warranty on it.</p>

<p>I was pretty intimidated when I first came into the dojo, and a bit
nervous before and during parts of the testing.  Fun stuff.  I winced
a couple of times during the ippons, especially when Matt simulated
breaking his uke's neck.  Eeek.</p>

<p>"Uke means dummy" giggled Marta.</p>

<p class=date>11:27pm</p>

<p>Now we're leaving Bennigan's.  I sat across from Brody (sp), the
main cat at the dojo.  By cat I mean second degree black belt.</p>

<p class=date>9:43am 4 September</p>

<p>I was really impressed with the test; tons of training is involved,
from memorizing Japanese names for moves, to studying the culture
behind the art, to learning how to kick someone's ass in a fight.</p>

<p>In one of the ippons, the bad guy started by grabbing Chucky's long
ponytail (it goes down to her butt) and she had his ass on the ground
so fast I don't even know what she did.  Amazing.</p>

<p>They had to fight against people wielding a (rubber) knife and a
wooden stick about 2.5 feet long.  In these cases, the weapon was
quickly removed and usually used against the attacker.  At the end of
one of the knife simulations, the bad guy stood back up and put the
back of his hand against his neck and flicked his fingers alternately
open and closed like the word "many" in ASL.  I was all, "??" and then
I realized he was simulating blood spurting from his jugular.
HHahahahaha!  eewwww.</p>

<p>In approximately 1991 or so I was in school at University of
Houston.</p>

<p>Bored maybe, or restless or otherwise longing for something, I
spent a Saturday afternoon reading from my high school yearbooks.  I
noticed that the kids who had been popular were no longer scary or
untouchable; they were just kids and I could have been equally amazing
and done all the things they had done.  I could have been president of
the spanish club; I could have gotten straight A's, been the class
favorite, everything.  I literally thought, "if I could go back to
high school, I would have done everything" or something like that.</p>

<p class=message><em>"If I could go back to high school, I would have
done everything."</em></p>

<p>Then I thought, "you idiot, you can't go back to high school so
just forget it."</p>

<p>Then I thought, "hey, but you're in college so you can do
everything <em>now</em>."</p>

<p>"But college is <em>different</em>, way different, harder,
scarier."</p>

<p>"You're just scared.  It's the same."</p>

<p>"No I'm not."</p>

<p>"Yes you are."</p>

<p>"Grrr. shut up brain!"</p>

<p>"Prove that you're not scared and go do it."</p>

<p>"Fine."</p>

<p>"Fine."</p>

<p>"Fine."</p>

<p>So I called Cyndi, an RA that I knew from the residence halls.  (I
was living in my apartment on West Gray near Montrose at the time).
As I write this, I have a recollection of being nervous about how she
might react.  "Hey Cyndi, I want to get involved on campus.  What do I
do?"</p>

<p>She was quite supportive and suggested that I visit the Student
Program Board, located in the University Underground, part of the
University Center.  Cool.</p>

<p>Monday morning I put on my best outgoing flirtatious personality
and walked right in to the SPB.  "HI, I'm Rob, and I'd like to get
involved."  A girl named Tanya happened to be there.  "Do you want to
help with Homecoming?"</p>

<p>I knew nothing of SPB, none of its committees nor activities nor
any of the students who made it all happen.</p>

<p>"Yes," I smiled.</p>

<p>"Excellent!" and Tanya told me when the next meeting would be etc
and I showed up.</p>

<p>This was in early summer that year, and we met several times and I
ended up organizing Recycling Day, an outrageously successful event at
which we collected 18,000 pounds of recyclables, mostly newspaper (we
had a goal of 3000 pounds), and that was after Marcel and I were
featured on the SPB campus TV station as our Hans and Frans knock-off
characters, Kristof and Kristof:</p>

<p>Wearing sweatpants and sweatshirts with little round balloons all
blown up and stuffed into our sleeves and legs, we looked like hugely
pumped up muscle bound guys with bad German accents.</p>

<p>"I'm Kristof!"</p>

<p>"Und I'm Kristof!"</p>

<p>"And if you don't recycle," <em>clap!!</em> "we'll be pissed
off!"</p>

<p>It was all fantastic and is one of the biggest coolest things I've
done in my life (egad!)</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>So it's been ten fucking years since then and I've been just
working at a dumb computer job (until June 2002) and I've done
fantastic good with YRUU in Southest District, but I haven't done
something big.  Something big like Recycling Day, or ride my bike
across the US, or become fluent in five different languages (1 per 2
years, easy)....  </p>

<p>Okay, so the point..  I have just been reading a book about Prague,
and  about kings and princes who shaped it and created castles and all
this cool ultra long lasting stuff still being talked about 1000 years
later.</p>

<p>I'm not sure that I want to build a castle just yet, but I do want
to know more about the world - learn more languages and meet more
people and learn more cultures.  I'm embarassed for myself and my
culture that I don't know more about other continents and stuff; I've
never been to most of Europe, none of Asia, Japan, Tasmania, Africa,
Antartica, South America, New Zealand, never climbed an Egyptian
pyramid, nor seen the Great Wall of China...</p>

<p>Why not?  Why don't I just get on my bike and go fuckin' ride
around the world?  Now would be a good time to begin such a trek.  Or
at least start planning it.</p>

<p>Haven't worked too much today, unless sleeping, eating cookies, and
watching Simpsons is work.  Saw episode where Lisa falls in love with
the new neighbor girl ("You're going to be rich! There's your mansion,
there's your porsche, and (spit) there's your pool!"), and the one
with Mr Bergstrom, Lisa's substitute teacher ("More asbestos!!  More
asbestos!!"  and "You are Lisa Simpson"), and Bart falls in love with
Jessica the preacher's daughter ("You're turning me into a criminal,
and I only wanted to be a petty thug." and "It's amazing what some
chumps will do for a girl.  Wait until she sees the second rate job I
do on the steps!"), and Milhouse fell in love with Samantha Stanky
("Please welcome Samantha Stinky" "Stanky" "Oh, that must be terribly
embarassing."  and "It's not just the kissing, it's the waiting.  Like
when you open an eskimo pie and wait just a second until it starts to
melt."  "She doesn't melt."  "Oh yes she does..")</p>

<p>We're going to Marta's parents' house to do laundry and be internet
connected.</p>

<p class=date>9:14pm</p>

<p>Couldn't figure out how to get my computer connected, but while
checking my yahoo email, I got a surprising pop up add in a window
that seemed to have no border.  It looked like a border, but the mouse
icon turned to the web-link-click shape even when hovering over the
apparent border.  And it wasn't an image on a bigger window.  It was
actually its own window.  I didn't think to view the sourcecode of the
bigger screen to see how they did it.</p>

<p>We watched <em>Empire of the Sun</em> on video and the last part of
<em>There's something about Mary</em> on TV.</p>

<p class=date>9:50pm</p>

<p>Something interesting is brewing in my brain maybe since I've been
reading a book about Prague.</p>

<p>I just chatted with Wende on the phone.  She's in San Francisco now
in a building super close to a sushi restaurant.  She's paying $1600
in rent and has no place near her residence to park her truck.  She
starts work tomorrow as the POS trainer of a Container Store.  Email
me if you want her contact information.</p>

<p>She drove from Houston to SF, and had her mom and 2 cats with her in the
truck.  They had to replace the alternator in some city with a funny
name like Longview in New Mexico.  Then just Saturday she had to
replace the battery on her truck.  Wow.  But she sounds like she's in
good spirits and she gave me blanket permission to say HI to anyone
she knows.</p>

<p>I told her that Jackie Purdy bought the naming rights to the game
Wende and I invented while we were together.</p>

<p>(soon as Jackie pays me the dollar, I'll give fifty cents to
Wende)</p>

<p>Episode where Marge is afraid of flying ("I just realized that we
haven't given a proper wedding to the cat and the dog; they've been
living in sin!")</p>

<p>For some reason, I made the assumption that someone would wake me
up for closing circle.  Now I have learned that closing circle is
<em>over</em> and that people are at Denny's.  Fuck.  I would have
enjoyed saying bye to peeps who were not going to Denny's.</p>

<p>I was also surprised to see that my computer had been left out.  I
left it with Calder writing on it so I could go to sleep after the
Silent Football game collapsed into sleepfulness.</p>

<p>I am thankful that my computer remained safe.  And I'm thankful for
the notes from Calder, Ed, Richard, Ashley.</p>

<p>Going to Denny's now.</p>

<p class=date>12:53pm</p>

<p>Denny's was fun, though it took a bit to find out which one they
were at.  Calder and I called different ones in Tulsa, and the one she
guessed was correct wouldn't answer the phone to confirm they had been
overrun by a horde of 60+ youth.</p>
