<p class=date>4pm Tuesday 28 July 1998</p>
<font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font>

<p>Missed Spirit Circle tody and I certainly didn't want to do that; I had wanted to compliment the youth on how well they are drinking plenty of water and to keep it up.

<p>I did make breakfast though, and then Drake Baer (theme speaker) workshop, during which I wrote a mythical story about how The Feel Good Net got started.

<p>Morning workshops and then I went swimming from 1:25pm to essentially now.  Played with Jason some but had to leave to take Debi's car back (said Wende) even though I was wet and Wende was dry, but I took her car back and walked back to the lake with Frank and two beach balls. Drake started to walk with us, but by about 1/2 way there, he turned back, realizing the sun was just going to be too much for his New Jersey acclimated self.

<p>Jason left by the time I got back and I felt some sadness; I still wanted to play!

<p>Instead played a small game of bouncing one of the balls with Andy Andrews (advisor) and then we began collecting small rocks from the bottom of the lake. He identified them to the best of his knowledge. Most of them were some type of sandstone. We also found some opaque smokey quartz. Jessica came over and helped us collect some, and we put them all on the dock for safe keeping.

<p>Also found a stick that looks not entirely like a turtle head when it is poking out of the water.

<p class=date>2:30am Tuesday 28 July 1998</p>
<font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font>

<p>This morning, Jason and I played lots in the lake again, chicken fights and acrobatics of whatever sort we could come up with including Jessica on Jason's shoulders while Jason on my shoulders. We tried some 6-person pyramids, but couldn't get them to work.

<p>We played keep away from Maia with Maia's hat and sunglasses. Actually I did play a bit, but tried to keep the group to remain respectful of her stuff.

<p>Then I took a phat nap before lunch.

<p>Water activity workshop after dark designed by Jen Colbert, included water balloon tossing and a big slip-n-slide.  Frank and I used raquet looking things each with a net to catch the balloons. I think we did quite well considering how dark it was.

<p>Ate plenty of ice cream after dinner.

<p>Then worship led by Tiffany Schneider was basically "break up into groups and talk about your beliefs." I expressed pretty verbosely what I believed and how my beliefs had changed throughout the years.  Afterward, I felt honored when Sean Murray said, "I had always wondered what Rob believed."  Wow.

<p>Back to main cabin for more ice cream and I loved sitting with an informal group listening to <a href="https://www.geocities.com/sunsetstrip/studio/4367">Kris Scott</a> live in concert, guitar and singing his various favorites and taking requests. He is really good and I look forward to seeing his performance career develop beautifully, not to mention purchasing his third tape when it comes out.

<p>Swam after dark and Susan accompanied me both to and from the lake. On the way up there, she held my hand and looked up at the stars the entire way there. On the way back, I held her hand and walked with my eyes closed the entire way back.

<p>Said HI to Chris Anderson, who had a CD pumping loudly from his car.  A german band with a name I can't begin to remember, but which he could pronounce surprisingly well.

<p>Bed now.

<p class=date>am Monday 27 July 1998</p>
<font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font>

<p>The same night after Jessica hit her head and we sent her to bed, Elizabeth (an advisor) asked if I would shave the back of her head with my clippers.  No problem!

<p>I clipped it as she requested and was walking in the dark toward the bushes to throw it away when 
<font size="+3" color="FF0000"><em>BAM!!</em></font> something clamped onto my toe and burning poison seared through like red hot electrocuting pliers biting through OHMYGOD that hurts get-it-off-get-it-off and I scraped my foot upside down to knock off whatever animal had so effectively stung me DAMN!!

<p>Back to the lighted area and nothing was on my foot, nor had been when I scraped it but oh my god my second smallest left toe screamed with agony.

<p>Amazed, I walked over to Arlene and Steve. Limping did not help; the pain ripped through me anyway. "Hi. Um, I got stung my something on my foot, and it really really hurts."

<p>Bix, Rafael, and Charlotte were quite loving and attentive as I sat wide eyed on the bench, repeating, "this pain is amazing," as Bix offered her hand for me to squeeze.  As other youth found out, they asked about my foot and gave consolations.

<p>Soon, the lymph node inside my left thigh began to hurt, and my lips began to tingle as my toe and foot were tingling. Wow. 
In describing the pain to someone, and given the injury and stuff, it was determined I had been stung by a scorpion.

<p>Limped to bed (okay maybe it did help) and Wende brought my pillow and stuff. I slept through the night to 8am, missing my 4am-8am roving shift. Thank you, other advisors.

<font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font>

<p>I am the Head Hydrator.  I got the job after taking it upon myself to hand people glasses of water with a simple smile and, "drink this."  I like the job because the youth really appreciate it when I give them water even before they realize how much they want it.  Or before they can work up the energy to get up in this heat and get it for themselves.

<p>We have two big 5 gallon water cooler things, and they get refilled about once per hour.

<p>Before most people came, I walked around the camp to get a sense of the layout and to greet the youth on SWUUSI staff. I rode around in the back of Adam's truck on top of a pile of matresses as Adam and Kris did a bed shuffle to get correct number of beds into the correct cabins.

<p>The youth and other advisors arrived amidst flurries of happy hugs for old friends and welcoming greetings to our new youth. I am (as usual) working carefully to remember or learn all the first and last names of the youth.

<p>The community is delightful and about to eat dinner. I've been wearing my soaking wet PakTowel around and over my head. Despite the heat, the general mood is happy and excited about the upcoming week.

<p class=date>11pm Sunday 26 July 1998</p>
<font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font>

<p>After dinner I watched youth swim, but I didn't swim at first since I hadn't brought my swim trunks to the lake. (it was a 7 minute walk each direction from the camp to the lake)

<p>I went and got my trunks and Jason Fricke and I had fun wrestling and goofing around in the water.  At one point we were standing back to back with our arms interlocked and trying to essentially do flips while staying in this position.  We were able to do it a few times, and that was cool.   <br>Then the funniest thing (funny to me; Jason thought it was funny, but thought my reaction was funnier) was when we were doing a flip and our backs squirted air from between them in a perfect farting sound and I collapsed with laughter into the water.
<br>Jason was all poking fun at me and I couldn't stop laughing. 
<p>That was so hilarious.  We laffed and laffed and had a great time. He jumped off my shoulders a couple of times.

<p>then Jessica got on my shoulders and jumped where it was too shallow and I cringed and then she came up out of the water holding her head. "Ow," she plaintively, and my brain fell apart.
She had landed basically straight exactly head first and crunched her neck. I helped her to shallower water and held her, soothed her, carefully keeping appropriate advisor boundaries. I didn't think to have Wende or someone zip back up to the main camp to get help. Jason made jokes to help cope but had to stop because Jessica couldn't laugh because it hurt her neck.

<p>Finally she was able to stand and get out of the water and she sat with Wende and I zipped back to the main camp and got Arlene (acting as nurse) who drove her car to get Jessica.  Because Jessica could walk, and could move her neck, we simply put ice on it and sent her to bed.

<p>(She was all better by morning.)

<p class=date>am Sunday 26 July 1998</p>
<font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font>

<p>After saying HI and bye to Amanda, and being up on my computer
I went to bed at 4am and slept 30 minutes until Wende called. During that sleep I experienced my soul perfectly existing in this continuous moment.  Beautiful.

<p>Wende said she was coming right over and she finally came over so very much later than I wanted and she wanted me to take some boxes to my back porch to be recycled and I ran to do it so as to not be late and holy shit I lost my toe ring.
<br>Sadness sadness anger sadness <em>why my toe ring that I've had for such a short time??</em> Fuck!

<p>Andger at Wende for being late subsided by the time we got to pick up Bix and Cathy from Spring High School at 6:10am.  I slept uncomfortably in the front seat at first on the way up, and then drove from just past Centerville the rest of the way... 29 miles into Oklahoma.

<p>We were not particularly super talkative on the way up, which was surprising to me, but I think it's because it was so durn early.  Wende's truck thermometer showed 107 degrees F.

<p>We stopped at Braum's along the way and I got a glass of water, a glass of orange juice, and a vanilla shake.

<p>So here we are and the camp is quiet as only a few people have arrived.  And it's hot.

<ol>

<p><li>I'll be leaving in a few hours for Oklahoma to be an advisor for a week at youth camp!  Wheeee!</li>

<p><li>I'm still hacked about not being able to retrieve my email from flashnet.  Windows 98 screwed up my mailstuff and it looking for a 'postoffice' on my machine.  I created one with the control panel but that didn't do the trick.  I called Flashnet and they said they didn't know.  Argh!!!</li>

<p><li>I am getting new business cards soon.  These will actually be typeset instead of my fun handwritten ones.  I'll make some new handwritten ones soon to reflect my new URL and email and stuff.</li>

<p><li>I have secured www.mrlaboratories.com but the site is not set up yet.
<br>MR Laboratories (pronounced "mister laboratories") is the name that Marcel and I made up during our crazy fun college days. MR stands for Marcel and Rob, or Marty and Rad, the two comic strip characters we developed in our likeness.  The comic strip never got too far, and the company is nothing more than a name, but now we have a URL..  Who knows????

<p>Send us money now and we'll let you know when our stock goes public!</li>

<p><li>After installing Win98, I have just now gotten all my MS Office applications working again.  Linux was never this crazy!!</li>

<p><li>I'm creating a snail mail database of all my homies.  If you wanna be on my snailing list, <a href=mailto:thunderrabbitATcheerfulDOTcom>send me</a> your snailing address.</li>

<p><li>Snail Mail..  Think about it.. that's funny!!</li>

<p><li>I'm going to ConCon in a week!! And then I'll see Jen for two days in Palm Springs!  Jen and I have the same b-date and immediately became fast friends when we met several years ago.</li>

<p><li>It's midnight. I still need to do laundry and pack.  I'll probably skip laundry, but I do need to pack.</li>

                        <p>1998 SWUUSI Review by Maia Cudhea</p>

<hr>

<pre>

i can't believe no one reviewed swuusi.  so i'll do it belatedly.
okay, here's what i remember several months later.

i got to camp really late saturday night, and the rest of staff was way
already there.  my hair was all done up from my sister's wedding (why i
was late) and i was so tired.  so we had this quick meeting and said we'd
do everything else tomorrow and i went to sleep on a table.  this was the
last time i was at a comfy temperature for many moons.  
next thing i know, kris is waking me up babbling something about the
perfect arrangement of cabins he and aaron worked on all night.  i was
all, okay kris.  so i helped everyone move beds from cabin to cabin for a
while, which was hot dirty work.

then people start arriving way before we're ready.  so me and ashley haul
ass to get touch groups done and registration ready while evryone else
works on other camp stuff.  registration is this big blur, but i remember
this awesome buddy-program thing we did for newcomers that worked great
and everyone was having a blast.
we did the opening circle thing and then i went ot bed.  i was soooo
tired.
this crazy bedlam of fun stuff and extreme exhaustion on my part and all
these mini-crisis persisted all week, so it's kind of hazy.  but some
stuff stands out

i remember swimming one night and playing this awesome game of water
volleyball where no one really cared or had teams, we just hit the ball
and laughed and splashed and had mad fun.  and i remember the awesome
food aaron and kris and anne worked out, with decent veggie food,
considering we were in nowhere, OK.  
and i remember the awesome power shuffle workshop taylor (used to be
mandi) led.  everybody cried and it was this big emotional cool as all
hell thing.
and i remember shopping for prizes for the touch group trash hunt with
debbi at wal mart. i swear we walked up and down every freakin aisle and
our feet hurt and our tummies hurt from laughing.  and then we were
stuffing ramen noodles in these little boxes and thought it was so cool.
and i remember the social action thing with east side renasisance that
came off so well, even though i was afraid it was gonna fall apart at the
last second.  and how ya'll all busted your butts in hot weather and most
of you found out you had a good time.
and i remember going to shoney's and finding out the guy we told we were
coming in didn't tell anyone else, but how they were really nice anyways.
 and we had so much fun stinky from working in public.
and i remember probably having the only comfy place to sleep, cause bryn
had this box fan by her bed and never slept, so i sat it on her bed and
had a breeze all night.
and we had an awesome game of silent football with bunches of people,
that did degenerate into chaos so i left.
and remember laughing till i almost peed when kris told me about the game
of capture the flag and the "leah song" and breaking out of jail.
and i remember the awesome theme speaker and super worships and great
adults and cool workshops and neato special events and the killer
community.

thanks for all the great memories guys.  love you.

                        <p><title>Skate and skate</title></p>

<p class=date>24 July 1998</p>

<p>Today I went skating!!  I totally was all like "I'm going skating" and I just decided to skate to Herrman Park and went basically down Montrose, a pretty heavily trafficked (sp??) 4 lane + turn lane street.  The traffic was a bit heavy as it was rush hour, so I mostly stayed on the rough and tumble sidewalks.

<p>The wind was pretty amazingly blowing against me; I looked forward to having it behind me on the way back!  I got to the park in about 20 minutes and I was hot!

<p>I met two skaters there and we goofed around the park a a bit, as a group pushing each other a bit more than we would have skated alone.. and we had a great time. 

<p>I never learned their names; only that they've been in the Houston area for a year and he's from Australia and I don't know where she's from.

<p>We skated down the hill that is the ampitheater seating for Miller Outdoor Theater and jumped up a wall thing and over the little park railroad tracks and we skated around the lake and just had a fun time.

<p>Then to Rice University we skated and I said "bye" to them at their car and *bing* I realized there was a drum corps competition going on!!

<p>Wow!!  So I skated over to where about 100 piece brass was practicing and rested and watched them perform.
They practiced until they had ten minutes till they had to march into the stadium.

<p>I watched several of the different groups practice I spent most of my time watching several color guards and they all had sabres!!  wow.  I loved watching and really longed to be back in the rifle corps from my high school days.

<p>Before heading back home, I got some water from a woman selling programs. I saved the cup she gave me so I could fill it on the way back toward home.

<p>On the way out I watched some drummers march and drum... I love watching the quads drum in perfect syncopation (even if I can't spell it).

<p>Refilled my cup and headed back.  The wind had essentially stopped so I didn't get the push I had hoped for, but the going was much easier.  I enjoyed that I was skating over crazy bumpy sidewalks and up and down curbs and around cars at intersections.. all while holding my glass of water.

<p>The coolest moment was when I was nearly home.
<br>A truck had just pulled up to the street along which I was skating and waited for traffic.  I confirmed that he saw me, so I knew I could safely skate in front of him across the street.  

<p>Just as I got near the curb, both skates hit a bump and I essentially bounced over it and off the curb and landed perfectly upright in front of the truck still with water in my cup.  That was cool.

<p class=date>23:59 Wednesday 22 July 1998</p>

<p>Today I was super productive.

<p>I made the final touches on and printed my advertisements that will help spread the word that I can do HTML work and webpage stuff for people.  (spread the word!)

<p>Then I spent a few hours at the Lodge creating a lovely report in our Access database and almost finished that.

<p>Then I went home for a nap and got a call from a man looking to be signed up as a FlashNet customer!  I was super pleased and happily surprised!  He had seen my name on FlashNet's site and gave me a call.  

<p>Totally awesome except for one detail; I had never signed anyone up before, I've never been trained, and I was like, "yipes!!!"  But I figured it out how to sign people up online and it was all good.

<p>Then Manda came over and we had a Jam Session.  A Jam Session is where we each figure out what our goals are for the next week or so, trade lists, and act as cheerleaders for the other to help them keep on track!  This has certainly kept me more productive and I certainly appreciate the support!

<p>(Although many people have certainly used this technique to help get stuff done, I feel obligated to cite Barbara Sher's book <em>WishCraft: How to get what you Really Want</em> which is where I first read about Jam Sessions.

<p>Then off to Denise's house with Wende and youth from church for a bar-b-cue dinner and meeting with Ann Fox, who just got back from Transylvania and had all variety of stories for us!

<p>After that I dropped Wende off at home and cruised to a tattoo parlour called The Celtic Oddessey to find Christine, but she had already gotten her tattoo and left.  So I paged her and went to Bookstop to read while waiting for her to return my page.

<p>At Bookstop I searched for <em>Conversations With God, Book Two</em> by Neale Donald Walsch, but they didn't have it in stock.  So I read a book called <em>Idiot's Guide to the Titanic</em>.  

<p>Christine never called me back.

<p>I grabbed an ice cream sandwich on the way home and munched and wrote this entry.
