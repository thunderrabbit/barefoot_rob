have used my keyboard.  Dang.</p>

<p>got some pretty good shite done at work today. S and I have set up
weekly meetings and they&rsquo;ve been pretty productive. Today we closed 3
tickets right off the bat (she hadn&rsquo;t seen that I finished them during
the week) and probably closed a couple others today. There are still
some outliers I don&rsquo;t know how to solve yet, but generally speaking we
are making much faster progress than before (when I didn&rsquo;t have
meetings with her during which I can ask questions, usually some
variant of &ldquo;can you be more specific?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In other news, when I went to the conveni, I got a facetime call from
Yoshie, who (later) said she had been calling me back.  WTF?  I sure
didn&rsquo;t call her.  My call log looks like we called each other back and
forth which is wayyy fucked up.  I haven&rsquo;t called her for ages.  I
wonder if my phone is having a heart attack or of it was due to a
network problem or if 1337h4x0r5 did something.</p>

<p>Nah it&rsquo;s some fucked up apple shit. there are tons of hits for
&ldquo;Facetime ghost call&rdquo; Fuck apple man; I&rsquo;m leavin&rsquo; (as soon as this
phone dies or pisses me off enough) and ain&rsquo;t neva come back.</p>

<p>Oh, in other news, it&rsquo;s Fred&rsquo;s 35th bday soon and we&rsquo;re going to play
Portal as soon as we can figure out how to set it up on The Internet,
or &ldquo;hip hop&rdquo; as you kids call it.</p>

<p>Playing silent football, with Nick and Laura D, they kept footballing to each other and then Nick sent it to me and expected me to send it to her, so I made a big show of finding a way to measure the distance to her: I searched in my pockets for a measuring device and found a short length of string and began to measure the distance to her, but it was more than 5 string lengths to get just to the next person so I dramatically tossed it over my shoulder and pulled out a pantomime string and measure one unit for each person away, and determined that Laura was in fact 4 people away from me.  I pantomimed the fwaps to get the ball there and realized that I couldn&rsquo;t because 3 was less than 4, so I shrugged like &ldquo;I have no idea how to do it!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nick sent the football to Laura with a zoom and then a bit later a few hands went up, even though I didn&rsquo;t see an error.  There was a new component to the game: lawyers, who would speak on behalf of their clients.  The hands hadn&rsquo;t just gone up to tattle, but to solicit clients on whose behalf the lawyers could speak.</p>

<p>Then someone showed me some paper with notes written back and forth on it.  I scanned through it but couldn&rsquo;t make much sense of it, so a person next to me (who knew the two people who had written the note) read it to me, using their Jamaican accents, which I don&rsquo;t know if they did naturally or dramatically.  She commented the not actually made some sense if you knew the guys, but their blatant disregard for standardized grammar was a bit challenging to read.</p>

<p>Oh, there was one other new component of the game: message encoding.  People could articulate a certain number of fwaps to be applied from the position of the person to whom they next passed the football by any other means.  It was essentially moving the football twice, and could be a way to pass messages between universes, I realized.</p>

<div class="dream">
I climbed the tree by using my legs/feet as  hands, and baically
climbed with hands and feet gripping the tree below me. I had to
climb back down a bit once I reached the level of the tree house
because there was no door on the tree side of the house, so I climbed
down ~~to the roof are~~ to the floor level and carefully stepped onto the
floor.  The floor was quite solid and particularly dry, covered in
foam cushions.  The other guy was sleeep already and my two friends
were there, having just climbed as well.  I saw some pornography in the
corner but didn't look at it; just made a mental note for later.  We
commented about how dry the place seemed; the roof must be perfectly
sealed.  I looked over the edge and saw a woman on the ground below
and was like "HI" but she didn't think to look up; she looked around
like who said that?

<p>This was a dream where I definitely did not think I could fly!!</p>

<p>Japanese class was difficult for me emotionally, I guess.  It was
really crowded and chaotic and loud; I could barely stay at the end.
I was like, [peww] headed out of there.  Tsun, Lucia, and Lauren (I
think his name is) were like, &ldquo;so soon?&rdquo; and I stood with them a bit;
they spoke quietly, and it was nice.  I don&rsquo;t know what it is about
the loud ostensibly fun conversations, but I just shut down mentally
and emotionally.  what is that all about?</p>

<p>I know when I took a personality test it said I clearly need people
time <em>and</em> alone time.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been enjoying Japanese class in Akihabara and Lin is of the
opinion that everyone there is trying to find someone to hook up with,
but that&rsquo;s simply not true.</p>

<p>But we do hang out and chat and there is cute りさ there, but no hanky
panky is happening or planned.</p>

<p>This morning I was like I&rsquo;m going to meet Tariq, and then later, oh
it&rsquo;s for his daughters&rsquo; karate thing and Lin&rsquo;s all mad that I didn&rsquo;t
tell her before.  I don&rsquo;t know why I didn&rsquo;t tell her, but a long ass
conversation about it won&rsquo;t make it any better.</p>

<p>Today I worked on getting Hugo to do some things I&rsquo;d like it to do.  I
created a crappy theme and used pagination functions which spewed out
300 pages worth of entries.</p>

<p>Need to get prev/next working before I&rsquo;ll actually have it a bit
further than Middleman, but wooodoggie Hugo sure is faster than
Middleman!</p>

<p>Worked on pong a bit.  Now the AI is a bit more random about what ball
it chases, but it&rsquo;s definitely not smart about it!  Play
<a href="/samples/unity3d/pong/16-pong-to-50-points/">pong to 50 points</a>.</p>

<p>I signed up for <a href="https://ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> so I can study
and keep my progress synced across devices!!</p>

<p>Oh, and I put some of our homemade yogurt into a towel, hung it in the
fridge, and hope it will make cheese.  Let&rsquo;s see.</p>

<p>Oh, and I made a maze for Katerina.</p>

<ul>
<li>-</li>
</ul>

<p>Oh the one big thing I can&rsquo;t do yet is type Japanese on the Debian
box.  I looked a the docs a bit and was like, ummmm..</p>

<p>Hopefully tomorrow I&rsquo;ll use the new old Dell Debian box to make an
edit to AB website.  T added a ticket today, and hopefully it will be
an easy fix.</p>
