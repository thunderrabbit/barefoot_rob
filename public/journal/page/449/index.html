<p>Wow.  For only $6 per semester, people can join the bike co-op,
have full access to all their tools and get parts at cost.  My bike
had a warp in the big front chain ring, and a broken spoke, so I
visited the co-op to get it fixed.</p>

<p>The warp in the chain ring was trivial to fix.  block of wood,
mallet, <em>bang</em>, it was fixed.</p>

<p>The spokes took a bit longer.  Turns out that two spokes were
broken on my back wheel, and they were broken on the right hand side,
so I had to remove the freewheel (set of gears in the back) to replace
the spokes.  Once I got the freewheel off, I discovered that of the 8
spokes on that side, 2 were broken, and 6 were ready to break.  The
culprit was that the chain would sometimes go off the freewheel, past
first gear.  I would still force it to pedal until it got back into
place, but that wore through the spokes pretty effectively.</p>

<p>It would have taken some time to find eight spokes the correct
length, but with a volunteer working on sorting the spokes they had,
it was simple for me to get them the correct length.</p>

<p>Replaced the spokes (a first for me), trued the wheel (made it
straight) (a first for me), replaced the freewheel (a first for me
(not that I had removed one before)), replaced the wheel.  Totally
totally awesome for only six bucks.</p>

<p>Thank you, Bike Co-op!!</p>

Subject: Dear Representatives,</p>

<p>Greetings!</p>

<p>As one currently represented by one of you, and formerly represented by the
other (ex-Austin, now San Diego) I beseech you both to help stop the madness
happening in our government.  I don&rsquo;t know if it will mean whispering in the
bathroom like junior high conspirators or standing in defiance of the
Speaker&rsquo;s gavel proclaiming a readjustment of priorities, but what is
happening is so blatantly wrong so clearly and horrifyingly foolish, and yet
it seems like no one is even trying to stop it.  I am not saying you are
inactive, far from it!</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s no secret that what Bush wants Congress to approve defies the whole
structure of the three levels of government that we all learn in what, 6th
grade, that he has been tearing little pieces from the Constitution, and
being loud and pushy about this at election time and to distract from his
equally horrifying CEO/economic situations and healh care and Social
Security and stem cell research and all the things he has swept under the
rug.  It is so obvious that he is not just wagging the dog, but has it
gripped by the tail and it swinging at anyone who comes near him, stomping
his indignant, draft-dodging little feet and saying &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m President,
that&rsquo;s why!&rdquo; but the American people are too easily suckered.  We are soft,
complacent, lazy, self-involved, too busy, too poor, too whatever to be able
to stand up and demand better.  We didn&rsquo;t even elect him for Pete&rsquo;s sake!</p>

<p>Sorry.  Listening to the news is like being in the back seat of a car being
drive wildly, recklessly, by a drunk teenager with a deathwish (one of the
Bush girls comes to mind) and all I can do is scream &ldquo;don&rsquo;t go over that
cliff&rdquo; but I am powerless to prevent it.</p>

<p>Please tell your fellow representatives and the candidates who might replace
some of you that they need to listen to the terror, read CounterPunch and
the NY Times and listen to NPR, hear what is happening out in their
constituencies, and stand up, in defiance of the Speaker, and stop the
madness.  I apologize for taking up so much of your valuable time, but I
cannot do more than spread the word.</p>

<p>Best regards,</p>

<p>Karina Montgomery</p>

<p>I'm leaving Oberlin now.  Just gotta get my shiznit packed and go.
I've already given Abbey a hug; she's in a meeting now with some peeps
about a wack situation where The Man is trying to shut down Abbey's
Peeps' operation if it doesn't conform to blablablah.</p>

<p>Good luck to Abbey et. al. on that.</p>

To:   Sally
Subj: Beautiful Sally</p>

<p>Oberlin was great.</p>

<p>I basically just made myself melt into the co-op culture, though I
didn&rsquo;t really break into many conversations with people that I didn&rsquo;t
meet through Abbey, my peep there.  I had my backpack on most of the
time as a disguise to make me look like a student.</p>

<p>Asia house seemed big and awesome.  That&rsquo;s the meal that featured a
big hugemongous chocolate brownie thing that was decadent for vegan!
Maybe it wasn&rsquo;t vegan, but a surprising amount of food there was
vegan.  At that meal, I helped by clearing all the dishes from Abbey&rsquo;s
clique of peeps with whom I was chillin&rsquo;.</p>

<p>On the second day, I rode randomly down main street, laughed my ass
off (inside my head) when I discovered that <em>was</em> downtown, on the
sidewalks of which they did not want me to ride my bike.  So I turned
left and soon found the bike trail and arbitrarily turned right.  I
was pleased and impressed that this relatively small city put so much
effort into their bike trail.  Guard rails, for goodness sakes!
Awesome.  And well kept asphalt all the way through, not some crappy
crap to ride on.  All the way past the golf course and past a dogleg
onto some real streets and then discovered the tressels above the
trail.</p>

<p>What a great challenge to get my bike up through the brush!  I almost
fell back once, as I lost my balance when a plant grabbed my bike
pretty effectively.  But persevered and got up to the tracks.  Rode
along the tracks toward the tressel first, and even road across it.
Its surface was iron plate metal (solid surface, not like railroad
ties between which I could see) that reminded me of the outer hull of
an old large ship.  I guessed and hoped it would be strong enough for
me not to fall through; I didn&rsquo;t know what held up this surface.  Made
it across no problem and rode lumpily across the next section of
railroad ties to the next tressel that was built in 1906 according to
the diecast plate on one end.</p>

<p>I needed to start getting back by that point, so I rode back across
both tressels and then decided to clambor down the <em>other</em> side of the
tracks, just for a change.  It was far far far more overgrown and way
more difficult for me to get through.  Lots of briars poked at me and
I basically had to push my bike up and over and through all sorts of
branches and brambles to get out.  Awesome fun.</p>

<p>Rode back, at one point pacing behind a guy on a racing bike (he
wasn&rsquo;t working really hard to go fast) until he turned off the trail.</p>

<p>Once I was on campus, on North Professor street, a guy yelled at me
from a car driving on the street!  It took me so by surprise..  He
yelled something like this, &ldquo;you think you&rsquo;re tough?  yeah I&rsquo;m talking
to you!  Do you think you&rsquo;re tough??&rdquo; and I wasn&rsquo;t saying anything,
just totally surprised, trying to figure out what the fuck was up with
this cat.  He continued, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you who&rsquo;s tough!  <em>I&rsquo;M</em> tough!
That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m driving away in this car!!  We&rsquo;ll meet back here at 3pm
tomorrow!  I&rsquo;ll be here, I swear it!  I swear I will!!!&rdquo; and he kept
yelling some more, but by that time was pretty much out of my hearing
range.  How bizarre!!</p>

<p>(I did not return to that location the next day at 3pm, so I don&rsquo;t
know if he made good on his word..)</p>

<p>Back at the blue house two doors north of Keep, Abbey and I watched a
video called <em>Tough Guise</em> for one of her classes.  It described how
this culture reinforces/encourages/assumes violence/strength/power
among boys and men as opposed to women.  It had a lot of good points.</p>

<hr />

<p>I paid $6 to the Bike Co-op and fixed eight spokes on my bike!  Two
were broken and six were in need of replacing.  What an inexpensive
great experience that was!  I&rsquo;m quite thankful for that awesomeness.
That process took about 3 hours, and made me later leaving for
Kalamazoo than I had planned.. <em>But</em>, it kept me there past 6:00pm, so
that&rsquo;s when I rode my bike to the post office in downtown Oberlin and
found it to be closed.  I rode back up the street to Drug Mart and
bought some stamps there, and then rode back to campus and it was well
after 6:20 so I grabbed one more dinner from Keep.  The front door was
closed, and I was all &ldquo;eek&rdquo; cause I don&rsquo;t have a card, but the two
doors behind-ish the porch swing were open,  so I just walked in like
I was supposed to be there.  Ate my dinner and gave mental blessing to
Keep and the campus and Abbey and the college world in general as I
collected all my stuff and drove away.</p>

<p>Then I was all, &ldquo;AHHHH!!&rdquo; as I <em>almost</em> forgot to drop off your letter
in Oberlin!  I didn&rsquo;t want to send you a letter from <em>Kalamazoo!!!!</em></p>

<p>Oberlin.</p>

<p>I love you Sally.  Really Really Really a lot.</p>

<p>I got lost in Michigan; I was driving north on 23, then at an
intersection with another highway, I literally couldn't tell that my
road kept going forward (there were no street lights), so I turned
quickly and attracted the attention of a Sherrif, and then when I U
turned across the highway maybe that doubly got his attention, and
then he says he pulled me over cause my bicycle is covering my license
plate.</p>

<p>I can't find proof of insurance that isn't expired... might have
thought that one through a bit better before leaving, eh (haha I'm in
Michigan, eh?)?</p>

<p>Um, he didn't worry about my lack of insurance, since the car is
registered in my name (found the registration and expired insurance).
Anyway, he let me go without a problem.</p>

<p>Nice.</p>

<p>Whew!</p>

<p>Oh this was funny:  Phone rang, Abbey got it.  It was for Betina,
one of her housemates.  Last night when I originally thought her name
was Petina, I was corrected and Abbey said they sometimes abbreviate
it at B'tina, or maybe even Btna.  I said, "booty, tits and ass?" and
Betina was all, "why do you have to emphasize the booty so much?"  And
Abbey came up with Boots Tits And Ass, with jokes around knocking
boots.</p>

<p>So anyway there was a call for Betina, and while Sarah was looking
for her, Abbey said "boots tits and ass" and the caller almost
certainly could have heard, but hopefully didn't know Abbey was
talking about Betina, cause the caller was Betina's dad.</p>

<p>We laughed a lot when Abbey hung up.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>With my Aunt Madeleine in a parking lot at her car,
kinda inside a building with some water nearby, and she started to get
ill or fall under water and I couldn't really keep her afloat, so I
hollered at someone to call 911, but they ignored me, so I grabbed her
phone and called 911 while trying to keep her from sinking and the
operator was all, "you have to call a different number" and she
wouldn't connect me.  I got really mad and was all, "just fucking
connect me to the number; my aunt is fucking drowning here!"</p>

<p class=dream>She never connected me, but some lady saw our plight
and was willing to help, and put Madeleine in her van but left me in
the water, which was no problem cause I got out easily.</p>

<p>I'm glad it was a dream.</p>

 Hello SunShine Lovers,

     May the change of the season and the tides of your life inspire
your creative soul.  It seems the colder it gets, the more pronounced
the directional energy flow becomes. Nature displays it all,  the
secrets and surreal miracles of life surround us. The dancing trees
with their chlorophyll drained leaves spiraling to the ground, and
their blood- the sap draining back into the roots, reminds me of  how
my second autumn of life- so close to the currents of nature- has made
me more aware of my own waning season of the year.  I want to practice
less questioning and doubt.   It has been my motto to prevail with
®energia que sobre®.  To continue with my own force that is not just
enough to get me through a day, but to feel the pulse of the power and
know i will have plenty left over, no matter what i might run into.  I
woke up this morning in a $12 hotel.  I took a hot bath, then got back
into bed at 6am.  I turned on the tv to see what time it was, when it
might be getting light outside, and the headline news was the major
flooding to the east.  Over the region where i am was a white
dot.  The weather woman said it was going to snow.  I turned off the
tube, laughed a little and went back to sleep.  I woke up and the sun
was shining.  The crystal ball is not always right. 

     I found a foot path yesterday!!! Shiny blue hand-made ceramic
tiles with painted pale yellow sea shells on them guided me off the
highway onto a dirt road which later turned into a foot path, that
later went over the mountain through a long stretch of tall cactus
like plants called ®toxos® (x=sch) in Gallego.  I later found out this
plant has at least a dozen names in this region.  I have known this
plant since the day i walked out of Burgos, my first encounter
with it outside of Espinosa (which means prickly).  The painful pass
over the mountain yesterday helped my original theory of the history
of the ®camino®. 

        The current legend of the ®Camino de Santiago de Compostella®
has to do with the lost cranium of Jesus of Nazareth's first cousin,
Saint James.  I have heard the story several times, and it is so
outlandish that every pilgrim that has set out from the far reaches of
Europe and other areas, in search of the bones of Saint James, have
all been considered over the pail crazy (if we were not already). 
Someday I will get the official ®scoop®on the story and send it on to
you.  In preparation for the ®camino®, i refused to read anything
about the trail, the history, the points of interest, etc.   I wanted
to discover it for myself, thinking that i could have plenty of time
after my walk to read the stories of others.  When I set out last
summer from Normandy, in the North of France, I quickly learned how
easily it was to get lost, even with a map and a compass.  By the time
I had made it across Bretagne to a river, I knew would take me to the
Atlantic,  I was ready to do what ever it took to stay by the river
and make it to the ocean to reduce my daily hours of absolute
lostness. Part of my journey is about trying to feel what I believe
the ancients could have felt.  I know the old ®camino®and the
reason pilgrims originally made this trip was to make it to
Finisterre, the ®end of the earth®.  It seems as absurd to us that
once the earth was considered flat, as it must have seemed to them
that the earth could be round.  Since the Christians imposed the story
of Saint James, and the calculations proved to skeptical  minds that
the earth was not flat, the journey to the ®end of the earth® has been
cut short by 130 kilometers or so, to Santiago.  I do hope the story
of Saint James is true, and Robin Hood existed, but their stories
remain as inspirations to people through out the ages and help guide
people to new levels of compassion and adventure. 

       And the French coast turned to swamp.... then the mountains got
taller and taller and the brush got so thick it was impassable. 
Rivers that were only crossable between low tide and high tide, when
the water was not rushing in or out, needed to be crossed.  I bet lots
of pilgrims learned to swim, and many drowned.  At the other side of
the river was more swamp, months of swamp.  Here, the ®toxos® are
blood letting.  I survived my days hike yesterday, in a downpour,
 with my poncho wrapped like a duster and chaps around my legs.  I was
still bleeding.  Those things make stinging nettles feel like
tickling feathers.  Here, the mountains are not small, and everything
is green and strong.  In a matter of days any cleared trail could be
taken over by the flora.  I have not seen any fauna (except a frog and
a bird).  So, on with my theory.  I hope this interests some of
you...   I think in the old days the pilgrims (or the ponderers, or
wanderers) tried to get to Finisterre or Santiago de Compostella with
the sea to their (our) right.  If and when they (we) made it (they say
at least 10% did not-due to their death),  I bet they were willing to
take any trail other than the one by the coast to make the return trip
to their place of origin.  Thus, the ®French Trail® was blazed further
to the south, mostly out of the mountains and in the practically
desert regions of Burgos, La Rioja, and Lyon.  What would be better,
lots of water, or no water?  What is better, to see the ends of
creation, the known limits of our existence and endurance, or let it
pass untested?  To soothe my own madness i will quote another
lyric, ®it is better to regret something you have done than something
you haven't done...®. 

       I think i will save Galicia for another year.  I am almost
there. I will make it, then re-evaluate my trail.   If i am going to
keep out of ®illegal alien®status i don't have time to reach
®Finisterre® anyway.  I have had it my way, over every large mountain
(except the one i was scared off of).  To guard my health i
have consumed vitamin C and raw garlic almost daily since i started
the pilgrimage.  My vitamin C requirements are now off the scale.  I
have pushed my body to her limits, and she has served me well. 
Galicia is a few days away.  It is my golden fleece, and as green as a
leprechaun's love.  It is possible that the things i am searching for,
i will always search for, knowing very well they are all within.  I
want to deal with my hate and my rage and my fear and doubts as well
as confront the beauty and creativity that i keep locked up.  In large
that is why I like to walk alone. I want to trace those branches
to their roots.  They are mine.   

     Last winter i caught my self wondering who the mothers and the
grandmothers confide in.  Who's shoulder do they cry on when the
stability they maintain is feeling too heavy.  I walked off the
mountain to call my mom and ask her.  In these last weeks I have met
several special women. Among them was a very old woman who recently
lost her husband of 65 years.  We talked and i found myself holding
her, she was shaking and in tears, knowing her future was full of sad
and lonely nights without her man.  Regarding death, I have found
there are no real consolations, only lots of tears and time.  Another
woman, a mother of 4- her youngest son 17 years old.  She owned one of
the hostels I stayed in.  The mother of thousands of pilgrims over the
last 12 years.  I had never seen an ®owner® of any of the 4 or 5
hostels i had stayed in, they were all just burned-out employees.  I
stayed with her until the rain almost stopped late in the afternoon
the next day.  I arrived on her porch in a cold and heavy storm the
night before.  She was having a nervous breakdown, and had attempted
suicide a few days earlier.  She let me make her lunch, and give her
an alignment and then hold her in her tears and feel her fears.  I am
blessed to know who holds the mothers and grandmothers when they need
to be held, we do.  Those people that can, that will, that is why we
are here. 

       Love to You and your Mothers...      ultreÔa, gin

<p>This morning Abbey led me through the process of barging into the
kitchen to munch eggs for breakfast.  I'm still not totally confident
in this co-op environment, so I offered to help the lunch cook
cook.</p>

<p>Renee was the lead cook with help from two or three others plus me.
We prepared a lovely "all vegan meal of curried okara and (cute!)
peas, baked squash (prize if you can name the types), steamed spinach
and garlic sauce, brown rice" as I wrote on the menu for the meal.</p>

<p>I'm super glad to be helpful in the co-op and feel much better
about munching with them.</p>

<p>At this moment, Abs is (checking email, but she was) transcribing
notes from a class.  Lunch begins at 12:20 (just a few minutes).</p>
