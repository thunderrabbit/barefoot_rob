<p>The storm has passed, and I'm still awake, but now
I have figured out 90% of the tools I would need to
merge my entries here with any entries on my
livejournal.com journal.  I'm still not sure that I
will do it, though.</p>

<p>If I do, I will have to write functionality that
will redesign how the left hand index is set up, and I
will probably have to just rewrite the entire
script.</p>

<p>We shall see.</p>

<p>This sucked.</p>

<p>Bottom line is some clients' comments were not
being saved, after I added code to make sure that
users couldn't lose data by double-clicking submit, or
by clicking submit before the page is displayed.</p>

<p>After I installed the fix, I did test it; the
comments showed up on the page.  What I didn't do was
click [save] and see if they *still* showed up on the
page.   The code works for certain now.  I have tested
it several times.</p>

<p>I have been super careful to make sure all the data
was restored correctly; it took me 5 hours to restore
it from our web logs.</p>

<p>I started at 3:30, after a not super busy (gently
productive) day.  I was hoping to be home when Wende
got home.  I'm going home now.  :-)</p>

<p>Welp, the lottery java applet has ended.  I resized
the window, and Netscape refreshed the page, and all
the numbers disappeared.  I had matched 5 out of 6
sixty-nine times.  Yesterday I had been playing for 45
thousand years; I'm sure it was at 50 thousand by
today.  I shall start the applet again today with the
numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</p>

<p>Wende brought quesadilla from Big Pink for lunch
today.  We chilled and talked in the conference room,
gazing out the window, watching traffic.</p>

<p>I *might* have determined a solution to my
robnugen.com journal -vs- livejournal.com journal. 
It's well documented that one can write a CGI script
to read entries from livejournal; I might be able to
write a script that will seamlessly incorporate my
livejournal entries over on my robnugen.com site.  I
haven't done any beta testing, but I know it's
possible to some degree.  What I don't know is if I
can also poll livejournal for the *date* of the entry
so that I can sort them with my dated entries.  I
think that should be pretty simple... we'll just
see.</p>

<p>Minh, Dave and I each started 2 different versions
of the lottery applet.  On the first one we chose our
own numbers.  On the second, we all used the same set
of 6 numbers.  The person who wins 6 of 6 first, or
who keeps their browser up longest gets a quarter from
the other two players.  Four quarters total will be
transferred because there are two distinct games.</p>

<p>I got stuck working on webAF today; this is a new
tool that should hopefully make development of some
applications ridiculously faster.  I sent an email
describing my stuckness to technical support; we'll
see how quickly I can get it going again.</p>

<p>Until then, I will continue working on the G3
Administration website.</p>

<p>T minus 16 days to Oklahoma City Rally!  OKC is one
of my favorite rallies; I just *love* the actual
church building - so great for playing sardines!!</p>

<p>This is also the church that sports a lovely tennis
ball lodged in a vent outside, two stories above the
parking lot, inadvertantly thrown there by me in 1987
while we were playing butts up!</p>

<p>Yes, yes, 1987.</p>

<p>That was the year we actually attended Rocky Horror
Picture Show on Saturday night!  It was my first Rocky
Horror, but I had my hair spiked, and apparently fit
in enough to have one of the stage actors ask me if I
could fill in one of the parts!  I politely declined
the offer.  I also did not go up on stage when they
asked for Rocky Horror virgins. (shhh)</p>

<p>Back in those rally days, 50 or 60 people was a
good sized rally, and we had rally virgin
<em>initiations</em>, which were made to sound scarier
than they actually were.  I had been initiated at
Houston rally a couple years back.  At OKC 1987, I got
to lead some of the initiations.</p>

<p>My hair was still spiked from Rocky Horror night,
and I was wearing Troy's mirrored shades.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I don't remember the questions of
the initiation exactly.  Basically we put all the
rally virgins in a room and bring one virgin into the
initiation room at a time.  Everyone else is watching,
and the virgin is put up on "stage", made to stand in
a chair under a spotlight.</p>

<p>The initiator (me or whoever) asks a bunch of
questions, maybe "what is your name?" "why are you
here?" "what talents do you have?" "are you a virgin?"
etc.</p>

<p>Then when they're done asking questions they say
something like, "according to (whatever) Magazine, the
reactions you have displayed here are the same
reactions as you have/will display in your first
sexual experience.  You may sit down."</p>

<p>And everyone claps and then the initiate gets to
watch the rest of the initiations.</p>

<p>And that's the way it was.</p>

<p>But the point is, OKC in 16 days!!!</p>

<p>Last night at work I was able to get "back to
work," and even inspired myself enough to do some work
this morning from home.</p>

<p>Wende and I both had the night off last night, and
will for the next several Tuesdays probably, as
Spanish has been moved to Monday nights.  We just went
to bed (and to sleep) early.</p>

<p>I just moved online some pretty cool code that
allows me to modify the dates in a dataset over the
web.  Granted, there are certainly tools that will do
this, but we are still in a mode where every bit of
SAS is written by hand, and every bit of the HTML
displayed is written by SAS written by hand.</p>

<p>This is for the G3 Admin site that I created.</p>

<p>I'm about to test some code for sending some
reminder emails and then I might fix a bug in some
code and then I will hopefully have time to learn
AppDev Studio, which should supercede the by-hand
programming style.</p>

<p>I just added a bunch of YRUU peeps to my friends
list on my livejournal.com account.</p>

<p>There's pretty much a lot of cool shit that
livejournal can do that my site cannot do.  But
there's a lot of shit on my site that livejournal
can't do.  So I'm not going to move all my shit to
livejournal, because there's just *so*
<em>*much*</em>!</p>

<p>I'd like to have an even faster way of updating and
editing entries on my site; I <em>might</em> build
myself a web based editor to make changes and stuff. 
That will be very fly.</p>

<p>I am kinda sorta closing in on adding a search
utility to my journal, so people can find stuff in the
pile of entries.  I'm using a websearch.cgi that was
free when I first downloaded it, but the lastest
version of which is shareware for $25.  When I get it
all working I'll pay the author.</p>

<p>Speaking of $, I have toyed with the idea of adding
one of the Amazon.com whatchamacallits (hang on) <a
href="https://s1.amazon.com/exec/varzea/subst/fx/help/payor-faq.html/">Amazon
Honor System</a>, except for this caveat:</p>

<p><blockquote>
Web sites collecting money with the Honor System are
assessed 15% of your payment plus a fixed cost of $.15
per transaction.
</blockquote></p>

<p>Part of me is all, "how can I possibly think that
people would enjoy my site enough to pay anything for
it?"  In fact, that's most of me, not just part of me.
 I greatly believe information should be free.  Maybe
when I write a book online, I'll add a Honor payment
thing on the site.  Who knows?</p>

<p>It's 10 pm now; I'm going home.  Wende should just
now be getting off work (which is why I'm here at work
this late)</p>

<p>Oh!  Wende and I went to lunch today.  I'll write a
separate entry for it called <a
href="https://new.robnugen.com/journal/2001/05/23/lunch/">23lunch.html</a>.</p>

<p>Today I quit workin' around 5pm to go to lunch with
Wende.  Her day at work was from 7-9am (for a meeting)
then her regular shift from 12-10pm.  Such a sucky
long day...  it was my pleasure to go see her during
her lunch.</p>

<p>I hung out in the store reading a book about web
design before she was ready to leave.  Talked to Chad,
a guy who works with Wende, and just recently became a
DJ at KTRU!  He was interested and I invited him to
apply... he got it!  His shift is 5am to 8am on
Mondays.  I listened to the first hour of his first
shift; it went well.  He had the appropriate number
and types of mistakes that most new DJs seem to have. 
Actually, he had very few mistakes.  Great show!</p>

<p>Anyway, Wende and I went to James Coney Island,
where I got little corn dog bites and a vanilla shake.
 JCI vanilla shakes <em>!RULE!</em>.  I love them! 
They're like slightly melted vanilla ice cream with
extra sugar.  Awww yeah.</p>

<p>Wende looked through a wedding catalog, looking at
different invitations and different crap we could buy
for the wedding.  Some was crap, some was not.</p>

<p>For some reason I was suddenly reminded of a funny
line from last week's Futurama:</p>

<p>Everyone took a field trip to the edge of the
universe, and Fry put a quarter in the telescope to
look over the edge of the universe to a parallel
universe.</p>

<p>Fry: "You mean there's an infinte number of
parallel universes?"</p>

<p>Professor: "No, just the two.  There wasn't enough
room for any more."</p>

<p>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAA!!!!!  I love that
line!</p>

<p>Wende didn't think it was quite as funny as I think
it is.</p>

<p>Okay, I'm going home now for real.</p>

<p>On Friday, Molly sent me this link: <a
href="https://www.cadenhead.org/book/java2412/lottomad.html">https://www.caden
head.org/book/java2412/lottomad.html</a>.  It simulates a lottery in a java
applet, allowing the user to choose 6 numbers between 1 and 50, inclusive.
The applet simulates playing the lottery twice a week every week until one
wins big.  It generates random lottery numbers and keeps track of the number
of 3-of-6, 4-of-6, 5-of-6, and 6-of-6 matches one gets.  If one matches all
6 numbers, it stops.</p>

<p>Minh and I started the applet at the same moment on our respective
computers, and bet a quarter on who would win the most by 10am Monday.  If
we tied at zero on 6 of 6, then we see who has the most 5-of-6.  If that's a
tie, then check 4-of-6 etc.</p>

<p>At 10am Monday, he had won:</p>

<p><table border=1>
<tr><td>who </td><td>3 of 6</td><td>4 of 6</td><td>5 of 6</td>
    <td>6 of 6</td><td>paid      </td><td>years </td></tr>
<tr><td>Minh</td><td>42690 </td><td>2386  </td><td>44    </td>
    <td>0     </td><td>$2,570,529</td><td>24,716</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rob </td><td>42788 </td><td>2200  </td><td>31    </td>
    <td>0     </td><td>$2,5M     </td><td>24,600</td></tr>
</table></p>

<p>My $ paid and years played are not as precise because I haven't stopped
my lottery simulator yet.  Here's the email I just sent to Molly.</p>

<p><pre>
I've been playing 34 thousand years and haven't won big yet.

Drew said 3-of-6 pays $5.

I don't know how to guesstimate the 4-of-6 and 5-of-6 payouts, but I'll
guess 100 and 1000, respectively.

Then I've won approximately
59000 * $   5  ~ $300,000
3050  * $ 100  ~ $305,000
50    * $1000  ~ $ 50,000
                --------
                 $655,000

Even if 5-of-6 pays $10,000, I've only won $500,000 more or a $1.1M, though
I've paid $3.5M

Here's the result from the person who told me about the link.



Alright -- I just got back to my desk and running lottery simulation after a
day away -- it must be some 4-5 days now that I've been running it.

After 23,000 simulated years, and 2.4 million drawings, it appears that I've
won the jackpot! So I suppose that lotteries aren't such a ridiculous
proposition, for those with longevity in their families and persistence in
their character...

Of course, I suppose that one would have had to spend $2.4 million just
playing the lottery for so long, too... (admittedly, you would have won some
small sums along the way, to help defray that.)

I am hoping the subject line will make you think I won the java lottery over
the weekend.  I did not.

It's played 24 thousand years.  I've won 30 5-of-6, 2163 4-of-6 and 42141
3-of-6.

I imagine since there are only 50 numbers to choose from, it's a 1 in 45
chance to get 6 of 6 each time I get 5 of 6, so I should be closing in on
the big win.  (should be, if probability became more likely to win the more
times I don't)

Only $2.52M dollars spent!
