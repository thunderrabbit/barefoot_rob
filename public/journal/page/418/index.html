<p>No telling if I'll realisitically finish this entry, much less
forge a play by play of the weekend.</p>

<p class=note>(summary: Sally called her friend Jennifer on Thursday
to wish her happy birthday.  Jennifer said (during a 2 hour phone
call) come up to my party in San Francisco.  So we did and had great
fun.)</p>

<p>Plane delayed a couple hours getting there due to rain in San
Francisco.</p>

<p>Great party: with a tall girl and guy in leather, and gay males
giving me eyes and sharing stories of Costa Rica with Christine and
her brother Dan, meeting Patty who seemed as comfortable as being a
wallflower.  Met Shauna (sp) who goes by Trixie when she goes
bowling.  Met Serena and Jennifer, friends of Sally's from Oberlin.
Others are from Oberlin as well but I don't remember who.</p>

<p>Dan put some funk on stereo and we danced our own little grooves
for about 30 minutes.  I was thankful to have someone else there who
would dance like no one was watching.  (which they really weren't
watching, but still)</p>

<p>Tall girl was named Liza.  Dressed in leather for the party, she
turned out to be really sweet, from Georgia, with soft friendly
Georgia accent, and who now works at Tiffany's.  She's 6' 1", and was
6' 8" in her go-go boot-heels.</p>

<p>zzzz around 4am.  (I really have no idea what time it was, but it
was late)</p>

<p>In the AM Dan and I cleaned up the bulk of glasses and beverage
remains from the party.</p>

<p>Went to Samba class at 10:30 AM with Sally.  I was mostly able to
keep up, but not completely.  Thankful for the extra help Silvana gave
me.  Her class is 10:30-noon at <a
href="https://www.dancemission.com/">Dance Mission</a> on 24th and
Mission in San Francisco.  Once that class was over, we stayed and
listened to some cats play afro-cuban drums tirelessly.  At 12:30,
Sally went back to Jennifer's and I went to Hip Hop class (beginner).
I learned about 8 beats worth of the 48 beat routine he spelled out
for us.  I left about 20 minutes early cause it felt like time, and I
was certainly not keeping up with the class.  I did some of Rob's
Crazy Dance on the side while they were practicing stuff that I just
couldn't seem to get.</p>

<p>BARTed home and it started raining just as I was 1/2 block from
Jennifer's house.  Perfect timing (see?) as they were just about to go
lunch somewhere.</p>

<p>Phu for lunch with Sally and Jennifer.  Got a present for Wende.
(Winnie the Pooh mechanical pencil)</p>

<p>Home, napped like three sardines with Sally and Jennifer on the
couch bed.</p>

<p>Awake, got tickets for the musical version of Hedwig and the Angry
Inch.  We all went to Shauna (Trixie's) to chat as the girls got
dressed.  Ate at an expensive place.  Went to see Hedwig.</p>

<p>I didn't get all the symbolism.</p>

<p>Stayed up until 4am chatting afterward.</p>

<p>Back to Jennifer's and to sleep by 5am.  Sally called a cab to take
us to the airport at 7am.</p>

<p>Zzzzzz</p>

<p>Slept most of the way on plane home to Hell-A and Rob = shower
now.</p>

<p>Sally and I are on the plane, on the ground.  We have just boarded
not so long ago, though we were originally scheduled to leave at 7pm
and arrive in San Francisco at 8:15.</p>

<p>We are now scheduled to leave at 9:06pm.</p>

<p>I'm on the ferry now, waiting a bit until we go to the other side.
I haven't had to pay yet, but it says bicycles are $0.65</p>

<p class=date>4:50pm</p>

<p>Now we are underway and I've paid.  One car, one bike, two
pedestrians, two operators floating across the bay now.  Three cars
and several people on the other ferry going the other direction.</p>

<p>Wow wow wow this is fun cause it's such a small operation.  The cat
just walked up to me with a wad of singles for change and a change
dispenser on his hip, "Sixty-five cents."  After we were already
underway.  I wonder if they would make me ride it back?</p>

<p class=date>4:53pm</p>

<p>We're across.  Bye!!</p>

<p>Been riding around Huntington Beach today, looking to purchase new
gloves, and new liner for my skate helmet.  I don't wanna buy a whole
new helmet cause I like the stickers on <em>this</em> helmet:

<p><ul>
<li>KTRU (black rightside up, yellow upside down)</li>
<li>Fly High Little Bunny ("Bunny" in the front and "Fly High" plus the
bat head in the back.)</li>
<li>Alien Workshop</li>
<li>NIN</li>
<li>ROCES Nuclear Power Under Your Feet</li>
<li>Senate</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Stopped in a few different shops and got new gloves from Seaside
Schwinn, and new helmet liner from Play It Again Sports. I like Play
It Again Sports owner, Sean (sp), who was quite customer service
conscious even while busy as fuck.  I commented on this, and he said
he took over the store some months ago, and profit has been going up
ever since.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Better personality, for one thing; taking care of the customers.
Plus not stealing from the store.  Little things like that...."</p>

<p>"hahah wow."</p>

<p>"Yeah, I've basically fired everyone who was working here - fired
six people in the last month."</p>

<p>"Rebuild your staff from the bottom up."</p>

<p>He doesn't have a website, but they're at the corner of Harbor and
Victoria in Costa Mesa.  949-548-7852.</p>

<p>My bike is ready.  Tightened the back brake.</p>

<p>Once across the ferry I saw a sign welcoming me to Balboa Island.
"What?  Am I on an island <em>now</em>?  I'm trying to get back!"</p>

<p>Behind me was water and I could see boats a couple blocks in front
of me.</p>

<p>Suddenly I saw a sign pointing toward Pacific Hwy, or Highway 1, or
the 1.  Perfect.  Over a bridge, through some small cramped houses on
small streets in beautiful dusky weather.  Got to a highway looking
thing and couldn't see if it.. ah, there it's Bay Avenue.  I'm looking
for Pacific Highway so I can get to Jamboree.. PCH must be up this
hill.</p>

<p>The name of the street up the hill?  Jamboree.</p>

<p>Wow!  I didn't know I had come this far back yet.  I was expecting
a couple miles at least.  A woman started up the hill on bike at the
same time as me, and she made it to the top by walking her bike, by
the time I had reached the top and waited for the cycle of lights to
come around again.</p>

<p>Left turn for Jamboree.  Good enough.  I got across half of Hwy 1 well
before they made it across to my side turning left.  Zooomed down the
hill and was dying on the way up, then zoomed down the next hill and
turned left across 4 lanes of traffic behind me as I had the left turn
light green and I zipped through it with one foot down ready to catch
me if my tires slip.</p>

<p>No slippage.  Perfect.  Speedy.  Awesome.</p>

<p>Bang!</p>

<p>RSA Inline on 1644 Superior Avenue.  Nathan <em>gave</em> me a new
top flower shape thing for my helmet!!  Whoooo!!!</p>

<p>Telling him all cool stuff about my travels and stuff.  Cool cat.</p>

<p>He used to live on Kauai (Hawaii!!) for five years going to school
there.  Says it was boring - everything closes at 7 and only one movie
theater.</p>

<p>He's heard of Ed Veiseh.  Woah.  He knows a cat named Rachard
Johnson, professional skater.  Three different people from Kauai have
showed up living in this area and he's just found them again
randomly.</p>

<p class=date>3:54pm</p>

<p>Nathan gave me a Strychnyne sticker to add to me helmet.  I tried
to give him a dollar tip for being so awesome and he gave me a
Powerade for it.</p>

<p>Showed me behind the shop they've got a skate park with a bunch of
four foot tall 10 year olds sailing around the ramps doing sick tricks
but wearing bike helmets instead of skate helmets.  Dunno what's up
with that, but hey.</p>

<p>Um, oh, they're hosting a skate competition and then a set of bands
is playing from 8 until ? on this Saturday night, so I may go to that
after sailing with Stefan and Cathy and Christie (if he gets unsick by
then)</p>

<p>So right now I am sitting on the beach in Balboa Island area.  I
don't see an island, but Fashion Island sure isn't an island either.</p>

<p>Bike is chillin' behind me, sun is low in front of me, bathing
surfers in warmth as they frolick about these waves on (and off)
surfboards.</p>

<p>So beautiful.  I'm glad Sally encouraged me to visit this beach.</p>

<p>Woah.</p>

<p>I'm going to miss the party at RSA Inline, but Sally and I are
going to fly to San Francisco for a double-birthday-plus-homecoming
party tomorrow night!  (Jennifer and someone's birthdays are today or
tomorrow, plus Christine is returning from Costa Rica)</p>

<p>I've never done anything quite so... wild in my life.</p>

<p>$118 for round trip tickets, one day in advance.</p>

<p>Oh my god... I just realized that we'll be coming back on Sunday,
which is the day I planned to drive up to San Francisco.  How nutty is
life???</p>

<p>We'll go sailing on Sunday to see the seals.</p>

<br>Hi Rob -<br>
How are you doing??? Remember me???  I have a friend that is thinking about moving to Houston and I could not give him an honest opinion. How do you describe Houston after living in New York all your life.  But the move would be a good move for him finacially.  Is it ok if he can email you if he has any questions.<br>
Thanks and Happy Holidays.<br>
Brandie</p>
