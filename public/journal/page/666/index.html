<h1>General Assembly</h1>

<p class=date>24 June 1998</p>

<p>Wende and I were 40 minutes late flying out of Hobby Airport for Detroit. That wasn't so bad; I was in a great mood and not in a tremendous rush to get anywhere..  I was in vacation mode.  Whee!

<p>Got to Detroit at 1:15pm and easily made our connecting flight that was to leave at 1:45.

<p>Yup, we made the flight.  Sat in our seats.  

<p>There we were, waiting to take off..   anytime you're ready, Mr Captain.

<p>Okay..  we're all on the plane with our seat belts fastened.

<p>The flight was cancelled.  They couldn't get the air conditioning to work, and said therefore there would be not only no cool air, but no cabin pressure in the plane.  That would be bad.

<p>No plane was sent to replace the one we were on.. Just <b>"sorry"</b> and we were on our own.  

<p>I'll save you the pain... but we were at the airport for 8 hours.  I bought a Popular Science magazine and read about UFOs and other science stuff.

<p>Around 8pm I sat by a woman who spoke fluent Japanese and very little English.  She showed me the first 11 Japanese numbers from zero to ju, and how to write "thank you" and "Tokyo" (Toukiyou)
and it was quite a grand time.  I got her snail address and probably will write to her.
<br>I can write "thank you" and "tokyo" 11 times and number them!

<p><font size=-1>transcribed out of my diary</font>

<p><pre>11pm We got to Rochester.  finally.
No checked luggage though; it will
be delivered to the hotel in the morning

Talked to Drake Baer and turns out 
he also quit his professional job to pursue
youth advising.  It's great to see Tera and 
meet Joey Lyons.

It's 01:15 or so Thursday 25 June 1998.
Welcome to General Assembly.

<p><P>Cc:  Service Manager at Fred Haas Toyota</P></p>

<p><P>HI</P></p>

<p><P>I apologize for the impersonal nature of this letter; I do not know your name.</P></p>

<p><P>I purchased my 1991 Toyota Camry around December 1997.  Since then I have had all work done on my car at Sterling McCall, until today when I got a flat tire on the north side of town.</P></p>

<p><P>Today I got a flat tire and when I changed it, I found one of the lugnuts extremely difficult to remove.  It had been cross-threaded.</P></p>

<p><P>I tried to put the small spare tire on, but couldn&rsquo;t get the lugnut to go back on correctly.  I saw that it had been cross-threaded and tried to put it on another bolt to see if that would help.  It did not help; I simply cross-threaded the other bolt. </P></p>

<p><P>So with 3 lugnuts on, I drove slowly to Discount Tire Company.  They fixed my tire but would not mount it on the car.  They said something like, &quot;those bolts are stripped, we don&rsquo;t want to break them, and can&rsquo;t replace them.&quot;</P></p>

<p><P>So I drove to Fred Haas Toyota to see if they could replace the faulty parts.  When I arrived, I told the service manager (whose name I have also forgotten) that the last work done on the front tires was at Sterling McCall Toyota and asked if he could replace the bolts at no charge.</P></p>

<p><P>He said he could not, and could not even &quot;work out a deal&quot; with Sterling McCall, and suggested that once the work was complete, I could take the stripped bolts to Sterling McCall as evidence.  </P></p>

<p><P>I chose not to drive all the way to Sterling McCall to have the work done; I did not feel safe driving with only three lugnuts.</P></p>

<p><P>I had the work done and paid $106.58 to Fred Haas.</P></p>

<p><P>The most recent time the front tires had been removed was at Sterling McCall on 3 June 1998, when I asked your shop to help with squeaky brakes.</P></p>

<p><P>My belief is that one lugnut was cross-threaded when it was mounted at Sterling McCall.  I clearly admit I stripped one other lugnut, but the main cost was not parts, but in the labor  ($82.43)</P></p>

<p><P>I want to remain a loyal customer of Sterling McCall, and I want to be reimbursed for at least <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> of my total cost, which would be $53.29.</P></p>

<p><P>I will be glad to bring in the stripped bolts if you want to see them</P></p>

<p><P>Thank you for your help.</P></p>

                        <p><title>Letter to Sterling McCall</title></p>

<p class=date>23 June 1998</p>

<p>Today on the way to the dentist, I hit something in the road and thought nothing of it.  Soon, however, I noticed my steering seemed really far out of alignment.

<p>I was talking to Manda on my carphone at the time.  "Hang on one second; this is bad enough that I'm going to pull over and look."  

<p>I pulled over.  I looked.  The right front tire was entirely flat.  "I'll call you back."

<p>I called Robin at the dentist's office and told her I would be late.  (I love having a cell phone!)

<p>While taking one of the lugnuts off, I found it was stripped.  Oh
crap. I was unable to get it back on, and had to cancel the dental
appointment and all that.

<p>The last people to mess with the lugnuts were in the service
department of Sterling McCall Toyota, so I wrote them a letter.

<p>On about 6 July, I got this <a href="/journal/1998/07/03sterling_response">response</a>.

<p>I was pleased I had written, and part of me thought, "you shoulda asked for more."  But overall, I think it's all good.

                        <p><title>got ppp working with Linux!!</title></p>

<p class=date>8:35 Monday 15 June 1998</p>

<p>Last night at midnight I shut down windows 95 after getting
help from my friend Ned on Linux.  I had been unable to get ppp
to work.  He told me to try the Networking icon in the control 
panel in Linux once I start XWindows.

<p>I did that and still had no luck.

<p>With a little poking around I found that I had to be logged in
as root for that to work; otherwise I got a bunch of zombied
processes.  Hmmmm

<p>With a bit more poking and lots of reading <em>SAMS Teach Yerself
Linux in 24 Hours</em> I found how to run a script called ppp-on
that would dial the modem and connect.

<p>I had to shutdown and reboot Win95 to find the phone number to
call my ISP, so I did that and rebooted into Linux.  I editted
the script and updated the resolv.conf file so it knew the IP
address of the primary and secondary DNS..

<p>After a few tries, I realized I had forgotten to chmod the
scripts to make them executable.  Then *bing* it worked!
It was 1:00am.

<p>I downloaded using Lynx the 3.2 meg Mosaic file and I could 
not find it on my system.. I have no idea where it went.
<br>So I went to bed around 1:35.

<p>7am *bing* I woke up and wrote down my dream and decided I'll
do laundry tomorrow instead of today (I promise!) and hopped back
onto Linux.

<p>I used ftp instead of lynx to ftp the Mosaic browser to my
machine and this time it was there.  (I tested with a small file
first)

<p>un gzipped Mosaic and ran it and wow!  it worked and I felt
the thrill of victory!

<p>Even more thrilling, I went to my homepage and the browser 
crashed and the terminal congratulated me with the message

<pre>
Congratulations, you have found a bug in
NCSA Mosaic 2.7b5 on Linux.

If a core file was generated in your directory,
please do one of the following:

  % dbx /path/to/Mosaic /path/to/core
  dbx> where

OR

  % gdb /path/to/Mosaic /path/to/core
  gdb> where

Mail the results, and a description of what you were doing at the time,
(include any URLs involved!) to mosaic-x@ncsa.uiuc.edu.

We thank you for your support.

...exiting NCSA Mosaic now.
</pre>

<p>I did as it asked (I hope emacs mailed it correctly; I think
so because the modem blinked when I sent it).

<p>I tried again to connect to my site and it worked!  And here I
am writing a happy successful journal entry from my Linux box.

<p class=date>2:00am Friday 12 June 1998</p>

<p>Tonight after work, I began installing RedHat Linux v5.0 using the book <em>SAMS Teach Yourself Linux in 24 Hours</em>.

<p>The whole thing was so incredibly easy that.. wow.  I am really impressed and really pleased.

<p>It's actually only to the point that I can log in to my machine and choose between 6 different text terminals and run XWindows, but it sure is fresh.

<p>I look forward to being able to surf the web and stuff, and maybe, just maybe (hopefully!!!) getting The Feel Good Net happening again.   That will rule.

<p>Have a good night; I'm going to bed.

<p>oh wait.. Wende and I went to see the movie <em>Truman</em> starring Jim Carrey.  That's the one where he lives in a virtual world that literally revolves around him. 

<p>The concept was pretty wacky wild to my brain, and I enjoyed the idea.

<p>Carrey's character is not as insipid as some of the other roles he's played; I enjoyed seeing him fill well and more real, more complete person.

                        <p><title>Mucky Duck and Brewery Tap</title></p>

<p class=date>1:40am Friday 12 June 1998</p>

<p>Last night (Wednesday night) I went to the Mucky Duck and hung out with Christine and some of my old friends who I haven't seen in 4 or 5 years since my days hanging out in the dorms at University of Houston.

<p>We talked about all variety of stuff and barely caught glimpses of each other's lives..  They've been seeing each other at Mucky Duck each Wednesday for some time now, so it was catch up time for me.

<p>Most wonderful for me was to see Melanie, on whom I had a tremendous crush back in the day (and I never told her).. and the reason it was so cool to see her is that I was able to talk to her coherently.  My tongue worked correctly and my brain worked correctly, and everything was all good.  I still think she's worthy of a crush, but at least now I can see her also as a person, and as an equal.
<br>Nice.

<p>Then Christine and I were gonna go to The Brewery Tap, and she left and I went to my car and oops... I was blocked in by another car.  

<p>So I went inside to ask the guys on stage (therefore with microphones) to ask whoever it was to move their car.  As I walked up there, <em>bing!</em>, I saw Chris, who I met at Studios and Stages two months ago!  How wonderfully random to re-link with him... it was especially cool because he is just about to move back to Canada; I saw him like a week before he and his wife leave.

<p>A few minutes passed and I went back to my car and was still blocked in, but lo, it turns out there had been a person in the culprit-car the whole time.  Wow.

<p>My brain did a happy floop, noticing how the details of my life were meshing, unfolding beautifully before me.  I love it!

<p>I drove to The Brewery Tap, where I met someone who shall (at least for the time being) remain nameless, and I talked with her 'till 3am.  It was all nice and stuff and we didn't kiss until I drove her to her house and she invited me in and we ate ice cream and though my more-patient-more-thoughtful brain said "no," we ended up kissing and having sex but it was pretty crummy cause it was 5am and I was so fucking tired (no pun intended).

<p>I got home by 6am and didn't feel too hot about myself or the whole situation and I crashed until 9:30 when the sun felt pretty hot and I had to get up and go to work anyway.

<p>Ug.

                        <p><title>One Week Countdown</title></p>

<p class=date>11:45am Friday 12 June 1998</p>

<p>So here I am at work, chillin' like Bob Dylan with one week left here. ("I'm just chillin' like Bob Dylan" is from Beastie Boys' "3-Minute Rule" from <em>Paul's Boutique</em> CD. (find lyrics at <a href="https://www.lyrics.ch/query/get?s=5822" target="new_win">www.lyrics.ch</a>) It's my favorite quote lately.)

<p>So anyway, I'm here and have finished my current project and I have essentially nothing to do.  So I've been cleaning up my email inbox and forwarding to my personal account what messages I think I'll want to keep..  I'm listening to Beastie Boys right now (I was inspired by my top paragraph) and yeah.

<p>So, will I be bored when I quit?  Probably.  Well, maybe bored is the wrong word. I will have to learn to restructure my time and essentially figure out a time budget.  I will definitely have more time and more freedom and less security and yeah.

<p>I'm excited and I'm scared and I'll keep you informed through these journal entries.

<p>I'm greatly considering getting The Feel Good Net going again; I will definitely have the time to do it; I'll just need to move my mailing list off my old school account from University of Houston to my personal computer at home.

<p>I think I'll do that now.  Hang on.

<p>Wow..  it's now 14:26; I've been moving stuff off that account for 2+ hours.  Just mailing to my current account tons of messages.  I think I will create a new portion of this website: one for holding those messages that float around the internet.. I've got several and I think I'll start a tiny archive here on my site.

<p class=date>5 June 1998</p>

<p>(all the names (except mine) have been changed)

<p>Yesterday, Jill, my four-level-up superior at work came around saying HI. She went through so fast that I thought she wasn't actually saying HI but counting to make sure we were all here by the official must-be-here-by-9:30am time.

<p>I mentioned to Dan (a manager) that I felt that way. He encouraged me to tell her how I felt.

<p>So I wrote her the following message.  I tried to state clearly my feelings, the data I saw, my judgement, and my wanted desire for the whole situation.

HI

I feel sadness with a hint of anger today, after I saw you wisk
through the cubicles and say "I'm just saying HI"

My guess is that you are counting people to get a general idea of
who is here at 9:30, not that you are saying "HI"

I would appreciate you saying "I'm counting people" if you are
counting people, or I would appreciate you actually stopping to
say "HI" if you are saying HI.

I would feel happier working here if I saw your actions match
your words.

If you want to say something like this to me, why don't you come
by & say it to my face instead of with email? 

Trust me if I was counting heads I would say that; I wasn't even
aware of what time it was. I miss getting a chance to get around
each day so I was happy (until I received this) that I had that
opportunity to do it today. Since my time is so taken I can't
stop and chat with each person, when there are so many, so I try
to vary who I stop & talk with each time I go around. This way
over time I get to talk with everyone; this wasn't your time. If
you perfer, I won't say hi next time.

I have cc Marty so he will be aware of YOUR actions.

Jill
</pre>

<p>I felt a bit of fear (even though I am quitting in two weeks anyway, none of the above mentioned people know this.)...
<br>so anyway, I felt a bit of fear that I'm going to be fired. I went to her office to talk.

<p>She said that I essentially accused her of lying (about what she was doing) stealing (stealing time from me) and that I questioned her integrity.

<p>She said this was clearly insubordination and that it was not to be tolerated in the business world.

<p>She called in Pete and Marty, my boss' boss, and his boss, respectively.

<p>She told them the same thing, and asked their opinion. Marty said that I could have said it in a different way.

<p>She said this was a warning, but that it would go in my file, and that if I did it again, "I will personally terminate you."

<p>"Thank you," I said, looking clearly into her eyes.

<p>"Do you understand what I am saying?"

<p>I did. "Yes I do."

<p>I tried again to articulate that I used the same protocol that I use with great respect in my men's group meeting: Clearly state feeling, data, judgement, and want.

<p>She didn't seem to feel any better about it.  She said that before I made such a rash decision with such little data, that I should have at least asked my boss what he thought.

<p>She also said something like, "this will stay between the 4 of us and don't mention it to anyone else." 

<p>At this point I told her clearly that I did not talk to any of my bosses because they were not available at the time, but that I had seen Dan and I talked to him.

<p>"And what did he say?"

<p>Almost trembling, I said, "he suggested that I write to you."

<p>She nodded her head.

<p>She asked if there was anything else, and we all said "no" or said nothing.  "Okay then."  Meeting over.  I left, closing the door, while Marty and Pete stayed in her office.

<p>So I left, and told Dan how I mentioned his name.  He said he'll talk to her.  We'll see what happens.

<p>I'm still leaving in two weeks.

<p>TWO!!!!</p>

                        <p><title>KTBZ drops ten thousand dollars cash</title></p>

<p class=date>5 June 1998</p>

<p>Today at 9am, a local radio station, KTBZ, 107.5 The Buzz, dropped $10,000 cash over a hugely crowded parking lot.

<p>I arrived at 6:30am, just to see what the whole event would look like.  I didn't necessarily expect to get any money, but I just wanted to <b>see</b> such a spectacle!

<p>There were about a few hundred people there by the time I arrived.  There were essentially two crowds: 1 around the table from which the DJs were broadcasting, and 1 around the band Nosmo King from New Orleans.  Many people were sprinkled about like any outdoor concert.

<p>I finally got to meet Will Pendarvis (sp) the lead DJ on the morning show. He's pretty young and kinda short and barely overweight, more like big boned.  He has a wide meaty mouth that reminds me of a frog.  He had his left eyebrow pierced, and was wearing a blue-collar shirt with the name "Paul" on the pocket.

<p>I quit listening to The Buzz morning show when he started on the air.  I think he's a dork, and not funny at all.  Certainly not as funny as the "good ole days" when Steve Robinson and Lanny Griffith were on all the time.  Lanny is still there but it's not the same.

<p>So I basically walked around and checked out the parking lot over which they planned to throw the money.  The crowd kept getting a bit bigger and bigger as the time wore on.

<p>I mostly hung with a short guy named Carlo, and his two friends, Rachel and Elizabeth.  I used them as a base and kept walking around talking to people and I would report back to them.

<p>I talked to the people who brought the hot air balloon, from which the money would be thrown.  Their sense was that the wind was too much and they wouldn't be able to do it.  

<p>There was also a rather large cherry picker there, with 4 huge wheels and a boom that could raise to 160 feet. I talked to them several times and they understood the money would be dropped from their thing instead of the balloon.

<p>From the cherry picker, they threw T-shirts.  All but one they tied into a knot so they would pretty much go were they were thrown.  

<p>Elizabeth (or was it Rachel?) caught a shirt.  I congratulated her.

<p>One shirt came my way and I thoroughly caught it with both hands, while an unshaved scraggly guy caught the sleeve with two fingers.  I pulled it down toward my feet and he kinda stooped to the ground to stay attached. I could see he wouldn't let go, so I said, "who's got the whole fucking shirt and who's got 1 finger on it?" and I let go.
<br>I have a lot of rally shirts that I love a lot more.

<p>After that T-shirt tossing excitement was over, there was still an hour before 9am.  I walked back to my car and took my shoes off.   The parking lot was way way way more full.  I had parked out where no one had been.  Now my car was in the middle of a sea of cars.

<p>I got back and decided to take an informal poll around the parking lot.

<p>Barefoot, I just walked up to whoever: "how much money do you think you'll get?"

<p>The responses were fairly consistent.  I'll make an estimate here:

<p><ul>
<li>40% said 1 dollar</li>
<li>30% shrugged and said "I don't know"</li>
<li>10% said, "whatever I can get"</li>
<li>10% said between 2 and 7 dollars.</li>
<li>3 people said 100 dollars</li>
<li>2 people said "all of it"</li>
<li>a few people said "around 20 dollars"</li>
<li>1 person said "three thousand dollars"</li>
<li>one guy in a group of 4 guys said, "all of us? with these elbows? I think we can get a hundred dollars."</li>
<li>one guy (not in the same group) said, "a broken arm"</li> 
<li>2 people said, "nothing"</li>
</ul>

<p>Some people asked how much <em>I</em> thought I would get. I told them "1 dollar.. I want one bill, whatever denomination."

<p>Near the end of my poll, I felt a tap on my shoulder.  It was a girl I had just asked.  She said, "if I get more than 5 dollars I'll buy you a pair of shoes."    I smiled and thanked her.

<p>So the time drew near and I couldn't find Carlo or his friends.  I stepped back from the main crowd and looked around at the expectant faces, all looking up toward the cherry picker, which held three men, and apparently had the money in it.

<p>The time came and a countdown was started at 10.  The crowd chimed in 9.. 8.. 7.. blah blah blah and they threw handfulls of money.

<p>Absolutely surrealistic, like confetti the bills tumbled and fluttered about.  It looked like the view from inside a snow dome  at Christmas. The bills tumbled in slow motion, making the whole scene bizarre.  The whole concept just seemed nuts to me!

<p>A few stuck-together-ish wads of bills fell, and exploded as people lept to grab them.

<p>Most of the bills flittered lazily with the wind, leading the expectant crowd like an amoeba across the parking lot.

<p>And then <em>snap!</em> a bill would finally come within jumping reach and get snagged.  <em>snap!</em> <em>snap!</em> like fish leaping from the water for a snack, several hands would jump at each bill.

<p>One came within my <em>snap</em>ping reach and I jumped and snagged it as another guy barely missed it. One dollar.  I had reached my goal.

<p>I was still barefoot, and a couple of times I had to press at people as if in a mosh pit, to keep them off my feet.

<p>I looked down for any missed bills and saw a bill under a guy's shoe.  So I basically squatted down and bullied him out of the way and got my second dollar.  He didn't even know he was on it.

<p>So that was it.  A few more small flurries gently fluttered down, but mostly that was it.

<p>I saw a small tree branch on the ground.  It had been ripped from its tree in the melee.  I felt sad for the tree, and walked purposefully with the branch toward the table from which they were broadcasting.  People were thoroughly crowded around the table and I kinda tossed the branch between some people onto the table and walked away.  That was my environmental statement of the day.

<p>Amidst shouts of, "that wasn't ten thousand dollars!" with my two wadded up bills, I walked back toward my car, and recognized with some dismay, "uh oh.. now everyone has to leave."

<p>The parking lot looked like a stadium where a baseball game had just ended.  People walking and talking and chilling in, on, around their cars, while cars were stuck in lines, or driving over medians and over grass to get out the fastest.  

<p>I happened to walk in front of Stacy (a friend of Wende's) who recognized me!  "Rob!" she called through her windshield at me.

<p>Wow!  So I knelt down beside her window and we chatted for a full 5 minutes before she got a chance to move.  She and her friend Dino had not gotten any money in the chaos.

<p>She said something about her mom let her off work and said she better bring a dollar back to make it worthwhile..  So I gave her one of my two bills.  "Really?" she exclaimed.

<p>"It's just a dollar."

<p>"Oh yeah.. I guess you're right, but something about it being a Buzz Dollar..."

<p>Hmm.  I hadn't thought much about it being from The Buzz.. That certainly didn't make many any less likely to spend it.

<p>She finally got the chance to move and we said bye.

<p>On the rest of my way out, I saw two people had taped their bills to the inside of their car windows.  Hmm.. so some people did view them as trophies.  At least for today.

<p>I got in my car and spent probably 10 minutes in parking lot traffic before I spent 5 minutes trying to get on the highway.

<p>10 more minutes and I was at work, wearing shorts, ripped up NO Fear T-shirt (with blood still from my most recent skating accident), no shoes, and carrying my work clothes inside.

<p>I politely said HI to Natalie and Tom, who each seemed a bit surprised at my attire.

<p>I walked up 8 flights of steps to the 9th floor and got changed without a problem.

<p>Read my next journal entry (insubordination) to see what happened next.

<p class=date>2 June 1998</p>

<p>Today in gymnastics I did some round off back flips on the floor and didn't really do them great but adequate.  I did at least flip over each time.  

<p>But I had more fun bouncin' on the big trampoline!  Jamie, who I met a couple of weeks ago and I were bouncing and just kinda goofin' around.  I showed him how I do front flips on my back to my back. He got a lot better at it while we played. I enjoyed being able to teach ... to analyze how I do it, and figure out how to break the motion into smaller bits.

<p>Coolest thing I saw tonight was Brittany doing double backs on the trampoline.  She had BB spotting her, but they were really clean and nicely done.  I can do double backs.  Maybe tomorrow.
