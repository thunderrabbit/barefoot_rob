<p><strong>10:09pm Thursday 28 March 2013</strong></p>

<p>Theodore the Crow was hungry. It was cold and he had no where to go.
Then he saw a light in the window of a cabin far way. He flew toward
it and landed outside the window, wondering how he could get inside.
He pecked on the window to get the attention of the man sleeping
inside, but the man had just finished another flagon of ale and
wouldn&rsquo;t stir until nature called in the morning. Theodore was
content to wait; the window was a bit warmer than outside, and he had
no where else to go.</p>

<p>Cindy the Cat saw Theodore&rsquo;s silhouette in the window. She thought,
&lsquo;mmmm dinner will be nice&rsquo; and stalked Theodore with the intent of
eating him. Theodore didn&rsquo;t hear anything as she crept silently
toward him. By chance, he thought he felt someone looking at him, and
turned around just as Cindy was within swatting distance.</p>

<p>Theodore, though cold and hungry, was a sharp witted crow. &ldquo;Hello,
there!&rdquo; said Theodore happily. &ldquo;Did you come here to get out of the
cold?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cindy looked surprised for a moment, &ldquo;no actually,&rdquo; she started. &ldquo;I
came to eat you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To meet me?&rdquo; the crow lied. &ldquo;How very sweet! My name is Theodore; what&rsquo;s
your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not wanting to be rude to food, Cindy answered plainly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Cindy,&rdquo; and
paused, then added &ldquo;nice to meet you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh it&rsquo;s so good to meet you too!&rdquo; laughed Theodore. I&rsquo;ve not met a
cat in many years. I just delight at seeing what incredible sense of
balance you have!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean? You can balance on a thin wire; I can&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; agreed Theodore, &ldquo;but I have to use my wings to
balance, but you don&rsquo;t have any wings!&rdquo; With that, Theodore leapt up
into the air and flew toward the beams supporting the porch roof.
Cindy was much quicker, though, and caught him in mid flight.</p>

<p>Nom nom nom.</p>

<p>A snake named Jeff was sleeping outside in the sun. He enjoyed the
nice breeze and white clouds floating softly in the sky. Then he saw a
cloud that looked just like an angel! He followed it as far as he
could, but then reached the sea and could travel no further. &ldquo;Oh no!
How will i catch the angel?&rdquo; he cried. Then he spotted a dolphin
splashing and leaping from the water. &ldquo;Excuse me!&rdquo; yelled Jeff, &ldquo;can
you carry me toward that angel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dolphin said, &ldquo;certainly! but you have to give me something
first!&rdquo; Snake didn&rsquo;t have much time so he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have time
now, but I&rsquo;ll give you two things later!&rdquo; The dolphin said, &ldquo;okay;
that sounds good. Come slide onto my back!&rdquo; and off they went.</p>

<p>The dolphin was a very fast swimmer and caught up with the cloud
quickly. By that time it had turned into more of a blob, so Jeff was
disappointed. &ldquo;Well, I will give you two things. First, I&rsquo;ll name the
blob cloud after you. What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; The dolphin said, &ldquo;my name is
Harriet. What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Jeff,&rdquo; said Jeff. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to meet
you!&rdquo; they said together.</p>

<p>Harriet carried Jeff back to the dock while Jeff tried to think of
another thing to give Harriet. They arrived at the dock and Jeff
realized what to give Harriet. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not ready yet, but come back in
one week, and I&rsquo;ll give you something!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harriet figured Jeff would not be there, but she came back to the dock
a week later. Jeff was looking quite clean! He was carrying a small
bag which he gave to Harriet. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s inside?&rdquo; asked Harriet
excitedly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a part of me,&rdquo; replied Jeff. &ldquo;Oh my god, it&rsquo;s your
skin! That&rsquo;s so gross and cool at the same time!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harriet had never seen snake skin before, but she had heard of it.
Now she could show her friends!</p>

<p><strong>6:15am Thursday 28 March 2013</strong></p>

<p><em>Riding in the back of a bus, after there had been a pretty devastating earthquake, but we were still trying to go somewhere, and the driver had to back up a try again to go this way or that way around the city to get to where we were going.  I was sitting in the back, and Lin was sitting a few seats ahead of me.  I had the whole back seat to myself and at one point the bus had to bak up and it seemed to tilt a bit precariously, and I was glad no one was in the seat with me because if we tipped over, it would mean they&rsquo;d all fall onto me, or me onto them and it would have been a mess.  With no one, then I could just stand up on the side of the window  or something.</em></p>

<p><em>Then there was an older woman sitting next to me and she had also done some classes with Clairvision, so we were talking a bit  and I showed her a book I was reading, and then the woman across from the table across the table from us was like interesting book and asked if she could look at it.  When she opened it, a small sponge fell out; apparently it had been inside the book. I kind of remember having putting it in the book, and I could see some of its sides had been damaged from being smushed in the book,but it still had its pyramid shape when unsmashed,   There was a pin in it, so I  tried not to smash it and be pricked with the pin and I warned the woman next to me oh there&rsquo;s a pin, and then I noticed there were a lot of pins, and the woman across the table had a lot of pins in a pin cushion as well.  I was like, &ldquo;is this yours then?  and she looked at it like, no it&rsquo;s not mine.. and then another book fell out of the first book; it was an introduction to unitarian universalism, and I handed it to the woman next to me while the woman across the table continued reading the first book. </em></p>

<p><em>Then another woman came up and asked &ldquo;for a free reading,&rdquo; which I thought was a bit rude at first, but then noted that she had green ectoplasm just oozing out of her temples, like something had really gone wrong.   I wondered if it was real, and the woman next to me said, we&rsquo;re probably seeing some kind of after effect and it may phase in and out of view, a and as the woman was talking her far  the affected woman was talking her face became like a skull and dry white hair and emaciated gross but still talking and wondering what was happening.  I sat and tried to maintain composure and then noted her color came back, her hair turned to a healthy black perm and she looked like Julia Roberts with a black perm and she was still talking, and the ectoplasm had vanished and everything seemed a lot better. Then as she began to change back to skeleton ectoplasm straw white hair, I interrupted excitedly, &ldquo;you know what?  you look just like Julia Roberts! I just realized that&rdquo; and then I thought to myself, &ldquo;oh crud I hope she likes Julia Roberts&rdquo; and the woman goes, &ldquo;really?  that&rsquo;s so sweet!&rdquo; something something and  her face kept turning into a skull and grossness and then I woke up.</em></p>

<em>Sho was discussing with Jonas about a new site, and I wanted to work on something but didn&rsquo;t have enough information to get started on my site.  I tried to get back to work and the scene shifted.</em></p>

<p><em>At our old house again, my mom went outside to sleep in the pullman trailer and I went to my old rom. I heard a noise with sounded like the neighbors pulling trailers around so I went outside to make sure they were only pulling their own trailers.  the light was on inside but both switches were off, so I tried to turn the right one on, but then just went outside and found my mom reading in the back of a station wagon and she was like &ldquo;I was just reading something you wrote; was this recent or a long time ago?  you said &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t wat to grow old&rsquo;&rdquo; and I was like, &ldquo;well I can&rsquo;t imagine it was recent; I don&rsquo;t remember it; maybe I was 9 years old&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>After reading on HN that <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=1210386">Google has discontinued Blocked Sites</a>, I was browsing through the extensions available for Chrome, and found <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/build-with-chrome/lbbbhbjeecagnlfgggogfclkdjamoapf">Build With Chrome</a>.</p>

<p>My creation hasn&rsquo;t been approved yet, but it&rsquo;s apparently visible if you click <a href="www.buildwithchrome.com/build/cFId">Rob&rsquo;s floating v-shaped Lego thing</a>.  It looks something like this</p>

<p>By the first person who looked at it, 瞑想頑張れ was rejected for being too simple.  I wrote in an appeal (which I forgot to save for posting here) that said &ldquo;yeah but it has the one killer feature that all other meditation timers lack!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s still available on github, but not nearly as easy to install that way.</p>

<p>Hopefully the appeal will appeal to the next person, or my planned updates will make the difference to get it approved.</p>

<p>Lin and I are on the train from Paola and Jon&rsquo;s house; we were the
only two students in yoga class, so we got all the attention and all
the goodies after the lesson. Yummy chicken stew something, several
types of cheese + sembe, and a fruit pie with three or four types of
fruit jam filling. Yumm!</p>

<p>We went for an hour walk around Lin&rsquo;s former high school; Jon and I
talked about boy stuff while Lin and Paola talked about girl stuff.
There was a house under construction on the corner and its foundation
had just been poured, or had it? I put my foot on it to test&hellip; Wet
concrete!! Ooops hahahaha! Jon mad a bit of a mark and I was like,
&ldquo;better not tell the girls,&rdquo; and we didn&rsquo;t. Funny that Lin is reading
over my shoulder as I type this (to the whole internettes).</p>

<p>After the walk, Paola suggested we watch a movie upstairs. I had
never been upstairs in her house, so it was a whole new experience for
me! Lin was like, &ldquo;realllY??&rdquo; because she&rsquo;s been upstairs so many
times hanging out with Paola. Paola pulled out a few Indian DVDs; Jon
and I were like, &ldquo;well hmmm&rdquo; as we read the synopses. Then when Paola
pulled out Fun with Dick and Jane, Lin was like, &ldquo;yay!! let&rsquo;s see
that!!&rdquo; and it was decided. Cute movie, and a nice surprise at the
end.</p>

<p>Afterward, we were going to go to the Pecha Kucha thing in Roppongi
tonight, but my head hurts, plus we&rsquo;d be late arriving, so eff it;
let&rsquo;s go home.</p>

<p>Right now we are sitting in Shibuya station on the Inokashira Line
platform as I write, Lin plays on her phone, people and trains come
and go.</p>

<p>The most interesting difference I noticed between my preparation for TJ Bike trip to Kyoto and Sarah&rsquo;s preparation for <a href="https://www.sarahouten.com/">rowing and cycling around the world</a> was that I had none and she had lots.</p>

<p>I might learn something from that.</p>

<p>Sweet!  I was just able to put together a child theme (called &ldquo;Rob&rsquo;s theme is more for functionality than design&rdquo;) with a function that puts the current date at the top of each entry.</p>

<p>This code is in my new theme&rsquo;s functions.php file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
    add_filter( 'default_content', 'my_editor_content' );
    function my_editor_content( $content ) {
        $dateTimeZoneJapan = new DateTimeZone(&quot;Asia/Tokyo&quot;);
        $dateTimeJapan = new DateTime(&quot;now&quot;, $dateTimeZoneJapan);
        $content = &quot;&lt;strong&gt;&quot; . $dateTimeJapan-&gt;format(&quot;g:ia l j F Y&quot;) . &quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;;
        return $content;
    }
?&gt;
</code></pre>
