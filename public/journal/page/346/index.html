                        <p class=date>5:21pm JST Tuesday 22 July 2003</p>

<p>I miss my bike, but I'm getting pretty good on Koko's mom's bike.
I'm kinda thrashing it a bit too hard; I think I'll need to buy her a
new one instead of giving this one back.   The back wheel is slightly
dented out of shape.  Just a slight lateral warp is all.</p>

<p>Just now a train went by just as I got off our street; still a
hundred meters from the bridge.  Previously, I have been on the bridge
while passed by a train and I've caught the next train.  This time I
was 100 meters further back.</p>

<p><em>I wonder if I can catch the next train.</em></p>

<p>I was (am) on the edge of late to meet Fumi, so I decided to go for
it.  This involved hauling butt (it's gotta be more than 100 meters)
to the bridge and up the slight incline, looking back over my shoulder
for cars trying to run me over.  Nothing beside me as I merged into
the bigger street (instead of onto the sidewalk like slow people do)
but a bus in front of me and two cars in front of it, trying to turn
left across my sidewalk, but they were blocked by the slow people
going across their street onto the bridge.  (remember these cats in
Japan drive on the left side of the road)</p>

<p>SO, I zoomed around the stopped bus between it and the next lane of
traffic (traveling the same direction as me), and past the two
vehicles just as the first one could turn left.  <em>zoom zoom
zoom</em> pushing hard up the bridge with a bus somewhere behind me
approaching soon.  head down butt up, passing the people on the
sidewalk as if they were <em>walking</em>, and crested the ascent and
then began my plan of attack on the intersection below.</p>

<p>80 meters past the bridge there's a traffic light at which I must
turn left to park my bike and visit the train station.  Usually there
are cars backed up at that light.  Sometimes there's enough space on
their left to pass along the curb, but most times that is blocked by a
scooter or the edge of a bus.  In those cases, I will usually slow
down and engage the sidewalk, if it's clear enough.  Other times, I
will slow down behind the scooter or whatever.  Rarely, I will zoom
around the right hand side of the cars and turn left in front of them,
carefully engaging traffic on the cross street and people possibly
going across the crosswalk.</p>

<p>This time, however, the curb side was clear and I hauled down it,
down the slope between the cars and guard rail (and small plant) and
checked the cross traffic, but had to stop instead of zoom into the
lane.  I zipped instead of zoomed and then accelerated to the bike
parking area and engaged the sidewalk without hitting anyone or
getting hit by anything.  Nice.</p>

<p>I tossed my bike up on the rack (4 feet up on the top row) and
scooted toward the station.  I made it before the next train came.</p>

<p>But, it was a Limited Express, and therefore didn't stop at
Tsunashima.  So I took the next train (Local train (stops at every
station)) and then transferred to the Express train at a station
called Jiugyaku or something.</p>

<p>Got a tiny bit lost by going out of Shibuya station on a different
exit than normal, but I made it to Hachiko <em>just</em> on time.</p>

<br>rob,<br>
ya swuusi was AWSOME. i seriously had the best week i have had in longer than i can remember.  i was so relaxed out by the lake.  i stayed up late attempting to learn new card games and dominos.  scotty forced brenda and i to meet new people the first night..although it felt awkward it was just what we needed to feel at home.  by the first real day i met a ton of people.<br>
<br>
i ummmm accidentally started to really have an intrest for someone.  Adam Lock.  yeah, you know him.  i saw him and was all &ldquo;thats who colleen hooks up with&hellip;.he looks like a jack ass&rdquo;  but then he asked for a ride up to the store and we talked, then when to town and talked some more. i realized how wrong i was about my first impression of him.i do realized he messes around with girls&hellip;wich is a negative.. but he is a great person who has goals and who actually is still inschool and loves music.  he was dancing in my car.  singing country music and conducting an orchestra. i loved how goofy he was and how free he seemed to feel.  we had some talks about how he has changed and along the way has lost some friends.  i tried to kinda get the skinny on him and colleen and determined he doesnt have any feelings for her more than someone to  &ldquo;hook up&rdquo; with.  so, yeah.  i took a nap with him. and felt so cofortable. <br>
i uhhhh yeah, did more than a nap&hellip;no kissing no sex&hellip;dont worry no swuusi baby here.  <br>
i dont know rob,   it was sooo great to see a guy who actually cared to hear about you, who didnt care what you did for him and when you wanted to do something for him (bec. you were a bit drunk)  he asked you twice to make sure you werent doing it to  prove something&hellip;..(that didnt exactly come out right but you get the idea..right?)<br>
<br>
sorry i am writting to you&hellip; your the only person i know who wont gossip :)  your a good mom!<br>
<br>
geeze, i really started to like him rob. but i dont think he really felt the same way.  i mean yeah we messed around or whatnot but i THINK thats all it was.  i wanted to talk to him sometime but apparently he is always logged onto aim but isnt ever really there.<br>
<br>
oh, and i made colleen cry i think.<br>
<br>
frank walked into the room when we were sleeping together, we missed elections, and apparently&hellip;time wise&hellip; colleen balled in the kitchen.  i was going to wait a bit before i asked her about it.  and she didnt say anything to me&hellip;we drove home together.. so i think frank may have said something to her&hellip; perhaps thinking i was her&hellip;.yah know.<br>
<br>
geeze rob.  but i did have TONS of fun.  such great people. it was exactly what i needed.<br>
<br>
ohhh on the other hand.  i have decided to for an extened period of time to not eat meat.  i dunno why.  but thats what i felt on the way home. and i really want to start ridding a bike again.  iuse to when i was younger&hellip;and my question for you is.<br>
what kinda bike is good?<br>
where should i look for one?<br>
and do you know if memorial park is good for bike ridding?<br>
<br>
(i am moving to memorial and shepherd by the st. thomas high school)<br>
so i will need a place to ride, or i can just drive to magnolia and ride there.<br>
<br>
i dont know.  this crazy idea came from Adam.  he rode from norman ok. all the way to camp. and his reasoning.  &ldquo;because it was hard&rdquo;  and i thought, yah know i just sit on my lazy ass all the time perhaps i should do something that i use to love and i know will be a challenge.  i use to love ridding when i was mad just to clear my head.  and now i plan on doing it again and gradually going farther and farther.   who knows what will happen.  and i figure if i really start ridding i could possibly meet some really gret people in houston.<br>
<br>
when you come back to houston, if you do, i doubt you will recognize me. i am totally a different person now.<br>
<br>
ohhh another thing.  when we were leaving on friday.. i went and fell asleep by the dock for a few minutes.  as we pulled out i felt like i had left everything there. everything about pat. everything about school.  i seriously had a cleansing feeling inside me. i felt totally free of all the worries i had come with.  in a  strange way it made me feel like an adult.  made me feel like all the shit from high school, the drama..all of it was just gone.  a fresh start i suppose.<br>
tomorrow i work for the first time in a week, i am looking forward to it.  i cant wait.<br>
<br>
ahhhh rob, things are great.<br>
<br>
pat and i are done.  for  e v e r.  it hurt a lot but this swuusi showed me that soooo many other people love me and will be there for me and that i shouldnt keep hurting about something i cant change<br>
<br>
wow, i wrote you a lot.<br>
<br>
much love<br>

<p>So we went across the street to Shinagawa station and I was like,
"what the hell?" cause the line for the taxis was really long.   I've
only seen it that long if it's raining, or if the trains are sleeping
for the night.</p>

<p>Fumisan couldn't explain it.</p>

<p>I practiced my Japanese, "Shibuya ni ikimas .. ka?"</p>

<p>She was like, "sou" (yes).</p>

<p>Got into the station and there was a *really* long line going *out*
of the station via the manned ticket booth (*) as if they all wanted
their money back or some shit like that.</p>

<p>Fumisan couldn't explain it.</p>

<p>I kept practicing, "Shibuya ni ikimaska?"</p>

<p>Then she was all, "no," and I'm thinking <em>what? you just said
yes a second ago..</em></p>

<p>But I could tell she was listening to the blahblahblahhanashimas
over the loudspeaker.  All I could make out was "bladadimas zenzen
blablahblah zenzen"</p>

<p>"Many trains nothing," said Fumi.  "Nothing" is one of her
all-purpose words, that usuallly means "there is no direct translation
for this word," but in this case meant, "are not working."</p>

<p>What happened?</p>

<p>"People are died."</p>

<p>That's not what she said, but I don't think it was perfect
English.  I pantomimed my hand jumping in front of my other hand.
Suicide by train.</p>

<p><em>Mass</em> suicides by train?</p>

<p>A wave of people began to run/jog as a wave away from the Yamanote
line to another line.  </p>

<p>(**)</p>

<p>We went with that wave and it felt to me like we were experiencing
something newsworthy; like maybe there had just been a major
earthquake (except everything was intact), or we were being evacuated
before an eruption or tsunami.  Awesome.</p>

<p>Fumi talked to a station-guy on the platform next to the one that
goes all the way from Shinagawa to Kawasaki in one hop, but the trains
on that line were stopped as well, so she took me back to a completely
new line for me, one which I believe is called Red Thunder, a train
that goes to Keiku Kawasaki instead of Kawasaki.  A train on which I'm
riding now.</p>

<p>The station guy monitoring the gate let me in with my ticket for
the JR lines, though normally I would need a different ticket for Red
Thunder.  Past the gates, I turned and gave Fumi an OK sign to assure
her I could make it home from here no problem.</p>

<p>While waiting in line for Red Thunder, I saw a cute western girl in
a baby blue jogging suit thing.  I resisted talking to her.  She and I
were near the end of a line to pile onto the train.  I could see the
train was packed as it arrived.  She was the second to last person to
<em><b>cram</b></em> onto the train.  Packed.  Possibly more packed
than I've experienced.</p>

<p>I considered winking at her as the rolled away, but I just smiled.</p>

<p>While waiting for the next train I called Frank.  "Look up a major
suicide on the trains tonight."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I'm in ... Shinigawa.  Many lines are down; I think they're all
suicides."</p>

<p>"Reeeally." as he says when something interesting has been
revealed.</p>

<p>"Yeah look it up."</p>

<p>"Cool.  Thanks."</p>

<p>The next train arrived before the opposite-bound train arrived on
the other platform.  This seemed unusual, but I soon had my
answer.</p>

<p>It was empty.  They added an empty train to the line to keep the
crowds moving.  And I was first in line.</p>

<p>Some other cat jumped in ahead of me, but fuck him I got a seat
anyway.  I've tried to keep an eye out for my station, but I've been
typing so I may have missed it.</p>

<p>Ah!  It's the next station.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>(*) just now, as I'm on the Red Thunder train, the doors kept
opening and closing at the station and a guy on the train got up and
pulled a man's arm relatively roughly, jerking him into the train and
away from the door.  The guy looked drunk; maybe his foot was blocking
the door or some shit like that.  It's not like he was being pushed
out the door, the train is basically empty.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>(** (11:38pm)) just *now* the train stopped for probably five
minutes to get the drunken guy off the train; his grip was pretty
strong; two men couldn't pull him hard enough to get him to let go of
the handle inside the train.  The station-guy had him in a wussy
nelson (arms under his shoulders, but not back around his head) and
another guy was pulling the guy's outer arm, and then a guy in front
of him hit the guy's inner arm to get him to let go, but that didn't
work.  Finally they got him to let go and the drunk guy slapped at the
station guys head and knocked off his hat. Shortened versionof the
rest is they tied his arms behind his back with a necktie (now there's
a good use!)  and then tied his legs similarly.  I got pictures, but
only through the window; I didn't feel right making a complete tourist
of myself taking pictures, but whatever, I guess.</p>

<p class=date>2:23am JST Wednesday 23 July 2003</p>

<p>I looked up news on 3 Japanese online news sources, but see nothing
about mass suicides tonight.  I'll keep looking until I find it or
forget about it.</p>

worth of advertising space?  This car is completely full, the adjacent

<p>Last night was a pretty big(?) festival, but I can't really tell by
looking at people today.   Maybe.. oh yeah I can; there are fewer
business suits on the train today.  This is a holiday for most of

<p>I've just done five lessons at KQ, and now, due to a tupatsu at
Kawasaki, I'm asked to roll (walk) over there to cover three lessons
while Benny stays at KQ and does lessons with the same two students
twice in a row and then one of those students a third time.  That's
fucked up.</p>

<p>At least the students he's teaching are bearable, and I'm not too
upset to not teach them; they're not particularly my favorites.   But
damn - three lessons with a body is a long time.</p>

<p>Oh, the point of this entry.  Earlier today Benny was all, "okay,
let's imagine you're the mayor of Kawasaki."</p>

<p>(blank stares)</p>

<p>"Is it mayor?  Who is in charge, who is president of Kawaskai?"</p>

<p>(blank stares)</p>

<p>"Okay, you're the <em>boss</em> of Kawasaki..."</p>

<p>Last night I also cried about Aya leaving Kawasaki; she's been one
of the nicest staff members (and one of the prettiest) here for these
months that I've worked.  Apparently she started working here just
after I did, but it's like she's been here the entire time I've been
here.  I'm on lunch now and she was just in the teachers' room and I
confirmed that today is her final day in big K.  She made tear
gestures and I was like, <em>no really; I really did cry.</em></p>

<p>She has to work tonight and cannot join us for the firework
festival excursion down near Yokohama.</p>

<p>Frank is hilarious.</p>

<p>The things about which he is passionate seem quite entertaining to
me.  I can't possibly explain it.</p>

<p>This is why I realize I must get a digital video camera.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>So happy to have Yasuko to teach me Japanese tonight.  This night
has ruled.</p>

<p class=date>1:10am</p>

<p>Yasuko is Peter's girlfriend, who he met through work.  As I go
past Lawson, I always glance over at the steps by the river.  Tonight
I recognized Frank's jersey, backpack, biceps.  Peter, Chris & Frank
happily ranted and argued and chided and discussed every random topic
they could.  Yasuko and I chatted mostly in English but some in
Japanese.  I learned how to say 1 month ago, or N months ago, and
first time, and the short forms of wrote, and went.</p>

<p>Ç¢ÇøÇ©Ç™Ç¬Ç‹Ç¶</p>

<p>Ç…Ç©Ç™Ç¬Ç‹Ç¶</p>

<p>ÇÕÇ∂ÇﬂÇµÇƒ</p>

<p>Ç©Ç¢ÇΩ</p>

<p>Ç´ÇΩ</p>

<p>She said she could speak ì˙ñ{Ç≤ with me - sorta open
invitation kinda thing.  We'll see how that goes; she doesn't live
particularly close to çjìá</p>

<p>I'm falling asleep as I write this.</p>

<p class=dream>I saw a funny commercial on TV about doing whatever it
takes to be successful.  Professional American football game, one
player was running down the field to score and the protagonist of the
commercial saw him, but there were too many players in the way, so he
ran off the field and around the world to plow the offensive guy off
the field just before he made a touchdown.</p>

<p>I'm going to work early today, where I'll sit outside the school in
the hallway and write some Japanese sentences and study vocabulary.</p>

<br>oops... had trouble sending the first comment, this may be a semi-repeat.  The comment got wiped out, don't know if it got sent.  it was something like this:<br>
<br>
Hey Rob,<br>
<br>
Thanks for allowing me to read about your life.  I always did have a soft spot in my heart for you.  I'm into September 2000, still in suspense.  I also found the BBS thingie.  I ran across a thread about the reasons you are in Japan... I skipped the entire thing!  I wanna hear it here first.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry if you may have taken my original comment to you (ass kicking) wrong.  I had just read a journal entry from 92 or 93 where you had written something like "time to visit the Castle and kick Scout Seven's butt."  Believe me, the comment was written with fondness and nostalgia for those times.  Through the years, I have often reminisced about the magic we created there.<br>
<br>
For the past few months, I've been toying building my own site, and you have inspired me to go through with it.  I'll have a log for my thoughts from each day, and other fun adventure kind of stuff.<br>
<br>
Good night TR,<br>
