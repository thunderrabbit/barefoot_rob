                        <p class=date>5 April 1999</p>

<p><p>On Saturday morning I was on at KTRU from 7 to 9am.  On the way driving there, only static was on the station; that meant no one was there.  This brings to mind one question for me: &ldquo;will I be able to get into the station?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>More specifically, will I be able to get into the building in which the station is located?  I&rsquo;m not a student at Rice University, so I don&rsquo;t have a card that will let me into the building if it&rsquo;s locked.</p>

<p><p>It was locked. There are 3 doors that I try to get in. Two are on like the side, and sometimes they are closed, but not locked. This day they were locked.  Hmmmmm.</p>

<p><p>I tried a fourth door a bit further down, but it was also locked. I called Alison, the DJ director, but she wasn&rsquo;t at home. I called Dennis, the only other DJ whose number I had memorized (part of it spells WHARF) but he wasn&rsquo;t in, or wasn&rsquo;t answering the phone at 6:45 on Saturday morning.</p>

<p><p>There was a janitor inside.  He saw me and said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re closed.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the DJ for KTRU! I need to get inside!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>He shrugged helplessly.</p>

<p><p>Hmmmm.</p>

<p><p>JUST then, or actually a minute later, Nancy was driving by on a golfcart thing!  Nancy is my next door neighbor who happens to work on the Grounds and Maintenance Department of Rice. Wow!</p>

<p><p>I told her the situation.  She looked at her watch, &ldquo;well at least you&rsquo;ve got 8 minutes!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>She didn&rsquo;t have keys, but called the police station on the radio.  After a couple minutes it was determined they could not let me in; I was not on the list. (that reminds me I should write to Alison)  Hmmm.</p>

<p><p>I told her about the custodian guy who was inside.  She called him on the radio, but no answer.  Maybe he was down in the basement.  After a few more minutes, we went back to the Fourth Door, and peered in.  We saw a cart; (someone should be near that, right?) and Nancy banged on the door.  She&rsquo;s got clout; she&rsquo;s worked there a while.</p>

<p><p>A man appeared inside the building to see what was up.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Ding!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>What?</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s his name,&rdquo; exclaimed Nancy, &ldquo;Ding!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>He opened the door and she explained everything and he let me in no problem this time.  Cool.</p>

<p><p>I thanked Nancy who said no problem, and I thanked Ding who apologized and I said no problem, and I got up to the station at 6:58am.</p>

<p><p>Beautiful.  I turned the lights on, grabbed a CD with a nice long intro and turned on the mic.  Soon the station monitors went from static to silence to music and we were on the air!  It was so close to exactly 7am that I won&rsquo;t even say.</p>

<p><p>Wende says, &ldquo;it was like&hellip; Seven. On the dot.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>There you have it.  Nothing <em>horrible</em> would have happened had I not been on at seven.  I wouldn&rsquo;t have lost my job; the FCC wouldn&rsquo;t have cared, but it&rsquo;s a fun story.</p>

<p><p>Oh, and I&rsquo;ll be on tomorrow Tuesday 6 april 1999 from 1 to 3pm.  <a href="https://www.ktru.org">www.ktru.org</a></p>

<p><p><b>STATE OF MY LIFE</b></p>

<p><p><ol></p>

<p><p><li>Dude and I worked for 7 days pulling data and voice cable into a new construction site.  It was actually an old warehouse being remodeled on the inside to be office space.</p>

<p><p>We got this job after working on a couple of small cable jobs for a different company; we were all, &ldquo;yeah we pulled some cable..&rdquo; and the guy goes, &ldquo;really?  that&rsquo;s what we do all the time; wanna help us?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>We were paid a delightful $25 per cable (actually we haven&rsquo;t been paid yet) and we did a super clean great job on all 182 cables.  Nice.</li></p>

<p><p><li>I bought stock in FlashNet soon after it hit the market.  It had jumped from $17 in the primary market to $39 in the secondary market; I bought it at like $43.  It immediately sank, then has come back up to that level now.</li></p>

<p><p><li>I intend to put $10,000 in stock by the end of this year.  I am thankful that money will come into my life as I need it.</li></p>

<p><p><li>KTRU has been great fun!  (Hey Bryn and Eryn!!!) I found the North American Frog CD!  I knew it should have been filed under Various Artists (various frogs), but I looked under &ldquo;North American&rdquo;, &ldquo;Frogs&rdquo;, &ldquo;Various Frogs&rdquo;..  I never found it. It&rsquo;s under &ldquo;Sounds of North American Frogs&rdquo;<br />
Yay!  I&rsquo;ve played some from that CD twice now.</p>

<p><p>I feel way more comfy on the mic than when I first started, and I&rsquo;ve experimented with various sounds and stuff.</p>

<p><p>The coolest mix I&rsquo;ve done is play Miranda July&rsquo;s &ldquo;Medical Wonder&rdquo; over Francis Dhomont&rsquo;s <em>Frankenstein Symphony</em>.  That probably means nothing to you&hellip;
<br>Basically &ldquo;Medical Wonder&rdquo; is a dramatic story told from the point of view of a researcher who has gone mad after an experiment.  <em>Frankenstein Symphony</em> is a CD of crazy sounds chopped up from various symphonies.  I combined the two, using Dhomont to amplify the drama in &ldquo;Medical Wonder.&rdquo;  I loved the result!</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m on air from 4-7am on Thursdays (CST)  <a href="https://www.ktru.org">https://www.ktru.org</a> to listen on the web!!
</li></p>

<p><p><li>I have made plans to go to Six Flags Great America on the weekend of May 7-9!!!!  I&rsquo;m super totally excited about it!  I&rsquo;ll use my Southwest Airlines voucher to purchase the tickets (should still have some $$ left over) and attend the park FREE with my Six Flags Season Pass.  yay!!</p>

<p><p>My friend Carina lives up like 20 minutes from the park, so she&rsquo;ll pick me up from the airport and stuff.  yay!!</li></p>

<p><p><li>Oh, this Six Flags excitement is part of writing my book, <em>Rob&rsquo;s Rollercoaster Roundup</em>, a big beautiful coffee table book of coasters and just riding them all around the country!  If you know any publishers who are looking for this project exactly, <a href="mailto:thunderrabbitATcheerfulDOTcom">let me know!</a></li></p>

<p><p><li>Wende and Dude got me the best present in the world!!!  Vanity license plates (oh that sounds so egotistical) that say &ldquo;MR LABS&rdquo;  See? delightful advertising for <a href="https://www.mrlaboratories.com">www.mrlaboratories.com</a>!  Also I have a &ldquo;ktru&rdquo; sticker on my car cut to bits to say &ldquo;www. mrlaboratories .com&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Chopping to bits and reassembling KTRU stickers is a common practice. The unaltered stickers say
<pre>
ktru 91.7fm
rice radio
</pre>
so it&rsquo;s easy to make them say &ldquo;mice radio&rdquo; or &ldquo;rick rodeo&rdquo; or &ldquo;foam dice&rdquo;  With a bit more effort, pretty much anything can be written, including
<pre>
www.
mrlaboratories
          .com
</pre>
with the &ldquo;mrlaboratories&rdquo; going up at an angle so it all fits nicely all on two lines.</li></p>

<p><p><li>I&rsquo;m late for church.</li></p>

<p><p>This is cut-n-pasted from an ICQ chat I just had with a friend of mine.  It includes an exorcism, so don&rsquo;t be surprised&hellip;</p>

<pre>
[Baron Munchausen] accually... there has been this "thing" that comes around when ever i go outside... even when i walk to the store... its there..
[thunderrabbit] like what kind of thing?
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] like a "im going to kill you and eat you " thing...
[thunderrabbit] is it a physical thing?  or a sense of doom you get?  
[Baron Munchausen] phisical
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] is it like a giant dog or a giant bear or giant rabbit?
[Baron Munchausen] more like a "giant human"
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] oh.  So is this person able to communicate on a humane level or does this giant human just want to eat you?
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] well  when im asleep... it speeks to me in my mind.. like it wants me to join it...
[thunderrabbit] So when you are sleeping is it like in your dreams like Freddie Kruger or is it just a voice?
[Baron Munchausen] well.. a voice.. very strong voice... and its not just when im sleeping.. also when im awake...
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] is this for sure the voice of the giant human?
[Baron Munchausen] a giant human for sure... when it talks to me in my head when im awake... i can see it... 
[Baron Munchausen] like it is right in front of me...
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] i dont know.. i can see it with my eyes but when i get closer to it (because it is im my path) it disapears or something...
[thunderrabbit] is it physically in front of you?  
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] Hmmm.. does this only happen when you are at Arlene's area?
[Baron Munchausen] acually.. it started when i got onthe buss for ar-kansas
[Baron Munchausen] ive come to except it that i cant get rid of it
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] so was there a person on the bus that did it?
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] i dont know... when i got on the buss, this man bumped into me and threw something on me... like dust...
[thunderrabbit] Hmm.  Are you able to communicate with your higher source or positive guiding angels or any of your positive helpful spirit guides?
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] type what it says.
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] i never tried... wait  its saying something right now..........frank... as you can see me and here me, i will come to you soon... we will be reunited once again.... i will clame you as my son once again... we will never part untill the apocolips arrives again...
[Baron Munchausen] 
[Baron Munchausen] wow.. 
[Baron Munchausen] its gon
[Baron Munchausen] 
[thunderrabbit] ask it why it is there.
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] ok  hold on... man... why do you communticate with me so...
[Baron Munchausen] why do you want me so much that you are willing to drive me crazy...
[Baron Munchausen] 
[Baron Munchausen] frank.... i am not trying to "drive you crazy", just reinstate you to your natural self... you are my son and i want to be reunited with you again... when this happens... thoes people will see that seperating us was never the right thing to do....
[Baron Munchausen] 
[thunderrabbit] what people?
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] the people of the earth...
[thunderrabbit] all people on earth?
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] where are you from?
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] how were earth people able to separate you, someone so powerful that you could travel so far?
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] when were you separated?
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] how long has frank been on earth?
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] Is Frank currently inhabiting a human form?
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] where is your human form?
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] oh, you believe you also inhabit Frank's human form.  is this correct?
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] Do you realize that you are driving Frank crazy?
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] Frank believes that he started hearing from you when a man on the bus to Arkansas blew dust on him, or sprinkled it.  What do you know about this dust?
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] Frank is currently in a human form.  How long has he been in this form?
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] so how long has Frank been in this current human form?
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] What is the reason that Frank is in this current human form?
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] What is the reason that you required 17 years to find the dust from your planet, if you have been on this planet since the beginning of the planet earth?
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] how could you not know?  
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] So does he take on a series of different human forms?
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] I don't understand "for not that I had found him"
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] If that is the case, it seems to me that this is the first human form in which you have actually found Frank and have been able to communicate with him.    Because I hear you saying that now that you have found him, he will not take on another form.
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] Are you willing to wait patiently until Frank's form dies before you are reunited?
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] Are you willing to not communicate with Frank until his form dies?
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] Would it be enough simply for you to watch him?
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] Frank:    I want to talk to frank for a moment.   is that okay?
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen]  yess... me and my son are not of this earth... my name is Lothose and i come from a planed 100 light earth light years from here... i come here for my son...i have been travleing for a long time... i was not sure how the people seperated me from my son... but we will reunite once again...befor you created your fictonal god...in your minds...since time when earth was created.... we came here to see what the universe has created...yes... and so do i... to keep him at peace...i do not understand...no... i have a form that i use... when i am near him...i am not "driving him crazy"... this is his natural state of being...the "dust" used was of my planet... i found him and wanted him to remamber his origianal place of birth... and this was the only way i could communicate with him in his state of humanicity...his current form.... he used it after his form befor that had come to itsend...exactly 17 years...to exist...it was not needed to find... i had aqired it and upon its arivle 16 years ago... i did not know that he had taken on this form...in human life... it starts and it stops... he has taken on so many forms that it was hard to find...once the form he has taken right now is nolonger in use then frank will take on another form if it was for not that i had found him...well, if had not found him... he would of taken on a different form once his current form "dies"...this is correct... when his current form extiguishes it self... then we will be reiunited...yess... no this would not be alowed... i must stay in contact with him untill his form dies ...no...yess...
[Baron Munchausen] 
[Baron Munchausen] alsdkf;alskdfjalsjfa;l
[Baron Munchausen] 
[Baron Munchausen] 
[thunderrabbit] how do you feel?
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] yes.  I am here.
[Baron Munchausen] rob you there...weird... 
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] hold me 
[thunderrabbit] I got you.
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] oh rob... what just happened...
[thunderrabbit] can you see what was typed?
[Baron Munchausen] wait... let me read it...
[Baron Munchausen] I AM THE SON OF THIS ... THIS.. THING...
[Baron Munchausen] and i am to join him once i die...
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] is this true..
[thunderrabbit] That is what he says.  I have no idea.  Is it true?  I'm asking you.
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] i have no recolection...
[thunderrabbit] I asked for Lothose to not communicate with you, but that's when he said "no this would not be alowed"
[Baron Munchausen] really..
[thunderrabbit] Yes.  I can email you the whole dialogue, including my questions, but since he did not press [enter], you will just get his answers in one big as jumble, I think.
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] would yo like me to email it to you?   to what address??
[Baron Munchausen] yess i want to lookk over your questions to...
[Baron Munchausen] i dont know  i have 7 of them
[thunderrabbit] choose 1 address and give it to me; I don't know any.
[Baron Munchausen] how about.... wait... CyboricMathGod!@yahoo.com
[Baron Munchausen] that one
[thunderrabbit] which would be th
[thunderrabbit] hang on.
[Baron Munchausen] wait... its wrong... he made it wrong...
[Baron Munchausen] Its  CyboricMathGod1@yahoo.com
[Baron Munchausen] he made me press "Shift" when typing the "1"
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] okay.   I sent it.   
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] I WANT MY SON... YOU HERE... I WANT MY SON...
[Baron Munchausen] wow..
[Baron Munchausen] he wants me bad...
[thunderrabbit] I hear that you want your son.  You have waited since the beginning of earth; I believe you can wait another less than 100 earth years.
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] what on earth are you talking about...
[Baron Munchausen] really
[Baron Munchausen] interesting
[thunderrabbit] Lothose said you and he have been on earth since the beginning of earth.  he's been basically chasing you from body to body until he found you in this current incarnation as Frank.
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] well...that is very interesting and all but i think he is right...
[thunderrabbit] right about what?
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] well... ever since i was born... ive had these dreams that i did not belong... that i was different..
[Baron Munchausen] that is why i joined the uni church... i thought that thoes people were just like me...
[thunderrabbit] Hmmm.  How do you feel about this new information?
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] i dont know... i mean... here ive been told that iv been on this earth for millions of years and im suposed to just agree with it...
[thunderrabbit] I believe I've been on earth in different forms for millions of years (I typed bil at first so maybe it was billions) but I have no awareness of someone trying to track me down.
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] you to.... that is very paculiure..
[Baron Munchausen] really
[thunderrabbit] I actually don't think it is so strange; I believe most humans are on earth for many or thousands of lifetimes in a row.  
[thunderrabbit] yup.
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] but what about the "comming from a different planet " thing...
[thunderrabbit] I believe that life can exist on millions of different planets, and that we are souls inhabiting these temporary bodies.  Our souls are eternal and cannot die.  The bodies die so we choose a new body once the old one dies.  We are free to choose bodies on different planets as well.
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] yess... but am i "Human"
[thunderrabbit] you are a soul inhabiting a human body.   I believe all "humans" are actually souls just temporarily inhabiting a human body.
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] but what about the "apocolips" comming 
[thunderrabbit] I am not sure to what he is referring about apocalypse.   if in fact the "end of the world" is near; (year 2000 craziness ... christ coming to earth  armageddon... all that kinda stuff then maybe that's what he's talking about)  if it fact it is near, I'm excited about it (not that I want it to end, but that kind of excitement would certainly be something amazing to experience (as a soul inhabiting a human body, instead of as just a soul watching from afar)
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] welll it cant be crist comming because he said " your fictional god"
[thunderrabbit] I think that he was referring to the Christian god that many US citizens "believe" in.
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] hhmmmm...
[Baron Munchausen] i just dont get it..
[Baron Munchausen] i dont know what to do...
[thunderrabbit] I am not sure what to tell you, but I believe you have a purpose and that just by believing you can know what is the right thing to do, you will know.
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] so.... do i "follow" my "dad"
[thunderrabbit] I would not think so.   He has been doing fine for billions of years.  I say wait until you are complete with this human form.  
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] what would it mean to follow him?
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] well he talks about joing him... do i forcfuly not follow him or do i just jump in front of a train and go with him...
[thunderrabbit] I believe you have a purpose to be in the Frank form here on earth.  For you to end that form prematurely would keep you from fulfilling that purpose and you would just have to do it again ( "do it again" means reinhabit another form all the way through its natural end)
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] well once this form is gone... then their will be no more forms... i will be with him
[Baron Munchausen] personaly...
[thunderrabbit] how do you feel about that?    no fuck that question.   I don't think it's true that you will be with him.  
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] but how do you feel about the possibility?
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] i like being here... and i feel that i have a right to stay alive and love...
[thunderrabbit] YES!   And I like you here!
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] but he is promising
[Baron Munchausen] and apenently he is my fauther...
[Baron Munchausen] 
[Baron Munchausen] 
[Baron Munchausen] 
[Baron Munchausen] 
[thunderrabbit] He could be any entity claiming to be your father.  I believe the only father (and I don't think that the masculine gender is correct)    the only life force is GOD=THE UNIVERSE=LOVE  and there are some entities that want power or something, but that "want" is not in the LOVING best interest of other entities.
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] well... ive never heard it llike that...
[Baron Munchausen] but why would he want me...
[thunderrabbit] He could be just picking on hundreds of humans until he drives one crazy enough to jump in front of a train.
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] I totally encourage you to gently ask him to not bother you again.  He is unwanted in your life and you expect him to leave you alone.   You have that power to simply ask him out of your life.  He must obey.. YOU have the body..  Discarnate spirits don't have the bodies and that is what they want.    Simply ask him out of your life in the most gentle way (ask gently and politely) and he will leave.
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] but i was starting to like him
[Baron Munchausen] 
[thunderrabbit] Well it's up to you.   At one point you said he was driving you crazy.    You always have free will.   You could probably ask him back later if you wanted the company again.     It's totally up to you.
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] but i am crazy it is what i stife to be... not insane crazy but... ya know...
[thunderrabbit] I do understand.  (I call it weird when I refer to my own version of crazy)
[thunderrabbit] I will not give you an answer on whether you should or should not keep him in your life.  I am simply making you aware that you are in control..  You can ask him to leave or stay.   
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] well... hhmmmmm... i think that i do not need another voice inside my head right now... i already have enough...
[thunderrabbit] Then gently and expectantly ask him to leave you alone.
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] ok  hold on...
[Baron Munchausen] 
[Baron Munchausen] person.... leave me alone... please..
[Baron Munchausen] 
[Baron Munchausen] I CANNOT DO THAT YOU ARE MY SON...
[Baron Munchausen] 
[Baron Munchausen] GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HEAD .
[Baron Munchausen] 
[thunderrabbit] Lothose.  Go to the light.  You are an discarnate spirit on earth.  Go to the light and the love and the universal peace.  You deserve peace.  You deserve love.   Lothose close your eyes and visualize yourself into the light and the love of the universe.  Allow yourself to leave earth and the physical plane and go to the light and the love of the universe. 
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] what light are you talking about... i see only dark...
[thunderrabbit] Lothose knows what light.  
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] Lothose you were created by the universe and the universe will embrace you back into its arms of love.  You simply need to let go of earth and the physical plane.  You have guiding loving spirits that will help you.  They are around you now and you can leave earth and go to the loving light of the universe.   Your spirit guides will lead you there.  Allow them to let you go to the light.  
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] Good by Lothose
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] I hear that you believe I will be sorry.  I look forward to meeting you in the future.   I send you only light and love and wish you peace.
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] Thank you Lothose.  Good night.  You may leave now.
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] no... I see only dark... i refuse... but if you want me to leave my son alone... then i will go.... but for a short while.... i will be back when his phisical form has terminated... then... then you will be sorry.. good by for now... but here me out... you will see me in the future and you will pay for making me leave my son... and i send you these words... fear me... my son will be my predisesor and he will clam many of you... including you...i shall do so...
[Baron Munchausen] 
[Baron Munchausen] 
[Baron Munchausen] wow... he is gone.. but in the future...
[Baron Munchausen] what then
[thunderrabbit] I have no fear of death.  I have no fear of Lothose or any discarnate spirit.  I am a powerful spirit and have the loving power of the universe and all my angels backing me up.  
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] i amnot afraid of death either... and not of him but what i will do once he come back...
[thunderrabbit] Good.  Simply ask him to leave again.
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] I believe he will not be back.
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] no.. im saying that when he come back that i willl have to "fill his shoes"
[thunderrabbit] Once you are dead (once the physical form you are inhabiting is dead) you will go to the light and not to the Lothose.
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] Don't worry about him bothering you.  If he tries then just simply have him leave.   If you need help with this, go to a psychic who can help cleanse you.
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] i wont worry now... not untill i am dead and gone...
[thunderrabbit] Fair enough.
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] well then...
[Baron Munchausen] how is the weather there...
[thunderrabbit] It's pretty nice.. a tad cool at night, but I don't have to use a blanket.
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] Just a sheet is enough.
[Baron Munchausen] of course not...
[Baron Munchausen] i love the cold... i trained for the "Poler Bear" club and i cant wait to join
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] HAHAHAAaaah   what are the requirements for this club??
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] well... not sure... i know diving i 60 degree water is one...
[Baron Munchausen] it doesnt sound cold but trust meit is...
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] I've experienced water that cold.  I know it is.
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] but i love it...
[thunderrabbit] We had a polarbear club in college.  There was a bridge club:
[thunderrabbit] Swim underneath a small bridge on the big fountain on campus.  The Polar bear club was to do that in the winter
[Baron Munchausen] why not
[thunderrabbit] and I joined both clubs.   I did not join the naked bridge club or the naked polar bear bridge club.
[Baron Munchausen] i under stand
[thunderrabbit] Just because I didn't want the possibility of being arrested for that.
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] but i plan on joining the national club soon...

<p><p>Okay.  I have just slept for 7 hours after working hard pulling cables yesterday.  It took us 5 hours to fix the 20 cables and get 9 more cables pulled implicitly.  That doesn&rsquo;t make sense.   Here&rsquo;s a wonderful graphic:</p>

<pre>
Original configuration:

@==========================================#

@ = the original telecom room
# = the end of the 10 cables
= = the 10 cables.



New configuration:

%-------------------$======================#

$ = the new telecom room (along the original path)
# = the end of the 10 cables 
= = 10 cables to the original end
- = 9 cables we were able to salvage from the original 10
as they follow the same path the 10 had used..

</pre>

<p><p>Maybe that helps.</p>

<p><p>Anyways, that took 5 hours and then in the subsequent 3.5 hours we did 15 more cables.</p>

<p><p>I went home, slept, got up, and as I wrote this entry, I ICQ chatted with one of my youth.  The dialogue was quite intriguing, about him being bothered by a discarnate spirit.</p>

                        <p class=date>7:53am Tuesday 23 March 1999</p>

<p><p>Yesterday Dude and I did some contract work for a telecommunications company. The job entails pulling about 160 cables into a construction site.  (&ldquo;pulling cables&rdquo; means installing the phone and computer cables (wires) that connect the phones and computers on the desks in the office to the main phone and computer switches.)</p>

<p><p>This particular job is the biggest of this type that we&rsquo;ve done; it&rsquo;s a lotta work, but we couldn&rsquo;t pass up the price: $25 per cable, and we don&rsquo;t have to actually punch down the cables on each end. (&ldquo;punch down&rdquo; means connect it to the pretty plate on the wall so a computer can just plug into the socket)</p>

<p><p>Cool.  So anyway, yesterday we started pulling the longest run first: 10 voice and 10 data cables from the telecomm room to the other end of the building.  We pulled the 10 voice, labled each end and terminated them at the telecomm room (&ldquo;terminate&rdquo; means cut the cable from the box out of which we pulled it), then almost finished pulling the 10 data when an older man and younger woman walked through the site.</p>

<p><p>I thought nothin&rsquo; of it, but Dude heard the conversation that occured in the telecomm room when they came through there.</p>

<p><p>Just finished pulling the 10 data and was about to go terminate them when our contact came in. &ldquo;Dude and Rob, we&rsquo;ve got big changes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Turns out the man is the Senior Director of the Board (or something), founder of the company (or something), and something else (or something), and he wanted that room which had been designated as the telecomm room to be his office.</p>

<p><p>Actually, the telecomm room was one half of that which he wanted to be his office.  Let me draw a picture.</p>

<pre>
----------------------------------
|               X                |
|               X                |
|  telecomm     X     something  |
|               X                |
|    room               else     |
|                                |
----------------------------    --
</pre>

<p><p>XXXX = a new wall that had been installed into the whole room that he wanted to be his office.</p>

<p><p>Part of the reason he wanted the room, apparently, was for the wooden floor.  Let me tell you clearly: that floor was messed up from all the construction.  First, there was mud and cement dried to it. Then there was wall plaster dried to it.  <em>And</em> there was a wall riveted across its center.</p>

<p><p>Cabling halted, they called our boss, we told our boss how much we had done and that one possible new location would be no problem for us to move to, and the other would require us to totally start over.</p>

<p><p>Now it&rsquo;s 8:16am and (we&rsquo;re a tad late) we&rsquo;re going back to see what is the verdict.</p>

<p><p>And unfortunately now that I think about it, the &ldquo;easy&rdquo; location will not be as easy as I had hoped.  We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

<p><p>Oh, I forgot to mention that yesterday was Maggie and Molly&rsquo;s birthday! They are twins; Maggie was my best friend in college.</p>

<p><p>Today Dude and I met with a guy for whom we will be doing some cable work (pulling voice and data cable in a new building for them). It should be a pretty sweet deal. We get $25 per cable that we do and he taught us some techniques that should make it go super quickly. There&rsquo;s over 100 cable; maybe even 150, so we should make several dollars.</p>

<p><p>Then we met with a man from my church who wants us to build a website for him. We got the domain set up and will begin work today. We got some ideas for what he wants and some content to start with and it should be pretty cool. He&rsquo;s paying us $45 per hour.</p>

<p><p>Dollars are finally beginning to come join my life since I quit work in the corporate world on 19 June 1998.  Yay!</p>

<p><p>With these dollars I intend to purchase more stock and ride more roller coasters and pay rent and stuff.</p>

                        <p class=date>Thursday 18 March 1999</p>

<p><p>Today I woke up and was all, &ldquo;whoah! my alarm didn&rsquo;t go off!&rdquo; I looked at the clock and it was only 2:30.  Whew.  Turned on the radio. static. Hmmm. no one at the station. Will I be able to get into the building? Hmm. I visualized myself being able to simply walk into the building and fell back to sleep.  Woke up at 3:00 and turned off the alarm, which had not yet sounded.</p>

<p><p>Got to Rice and walked right in the building; the door was slightly ajar (when is a door not a door?) and there were peeps in there studying and stuff.  No problem.</p>

<p><p>Into the station by like 3:20 and had to pee!!  Peed, back to the station (I remembered the code this time) and I even knew how to turn on the station.  I put my tape in and turned on the mic. &ldquo;You are listening to&hellip;.&rdquo;  I paused until the monitors switched from static to clear.  &ldquo;K T R U Houston.&rdquo;  and I read the MRA On (to be read each time the station is turned on.)</p>

<p><p>The shift was great; I only had a few errors, and I got them on tape pretty much, which is cool. I&rsquo;ve had grand thoughts of recording them from tape to digital and then onto a CD, but I certainly won&rsquo;t expect that to happen anytime soon!</p>

<p><p>I got a couple requests. I was able to play one, but the other two were from Wende calling in for Spice Girls and for Madonna. I recognized her sleepy voice and was all, &ldquo;Um, I don&rsquo;t think we have any Spice Girls&hellip; and if we did, I wouldn&rsquo;t play them because they suck!!!&rdquo;  I was just jokin&rsquo; of course as my way of saying, &ldquo;HI Wende; I recognize your voice.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&lsquo;twas a fun show.</p>

<p><p>- - - - -</p>

<p><p>Slept, cleaned, went shopping.  Had an overwhelming feeling of blug and if I were a dog I woulda just bit someone. I&rsquo;m not really sure of what the &ldquo;problem&rdquo; is; but half of me is happy feelin&rsquo; great like my whole life is lined up nicely, and half of me is still unsettled.</p>

<p><p>So I had a dialogue with my higher self.  &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the deal?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You feel your life is too complicated; wake up early each day and meditate for some minutes and figure out what you need to do that day. Do those things and then be complete for the day, and feel okay with being complete for the day. If you get them all done, then you are done.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Hmmm.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a lot of living left to live.  Stay healthy so you can do it all. There are more things left in your life than you could possibly imagine at this moment. Entire other life situations will be yours. Keep living and let them arrive as they will.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Hmmm.</p>

<p><p>Hrmmm..</p>

<p><p>On Saturday I went to Astroworld!  It was opening day for the park and it was cold!!  Actually the wind helped chill things more than the actual temperature, but overall this was great because only a few people were in the park!</p>

<p><p>Though the lines were short I have good and bad (sad (kinda)) news.  The bad kinda sad news is that Excalibur has been removed from Astroworld.  My understanding is that it has been sold to Frontier City, a park on I-35 in Oklahoma.  It&rsquo;s in storage now and will be assembled for 2000 season.</p>

<p><p>Excalibur was a mine train coaster built in 1972. It was the first significant coaster at Astroworld. I talked to one of the maintenance guys who had worked at Astroworld for a while. He said that Excalibur was a fine ride, but didn&rsquo;t draw the people to the park. I said, &ldquo;it drew <em>me</em> to the park!&rdquo;
<br>He said with a smile, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll like the new one better.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Good news is that a new ride called Serial Thriller will take its place.  It should be installed by Memorial Day 1999. Serial Thriller will be an SLC (Suspended Looping Coaster) the maintenance guy said.  It allows riders&rsquo; legs to dangle like a ski lift, and will have <em><b>FIVE</b></em> inversions!!!</p>

<p><p>Right now, however, there&rsquo;s just dirt where Serial Thriller will stand.  I got pictures of the dirt, and of the metal tubing holder things that will be the frame of the coaster.</p>

<p><p>I took 30 some odd pics from Astroworld including while on the
following rides: Viper, XLR8, Greezed Lightnin&rsquo;, Batman, Ultra Twister, Cyclone, Mayan Mindbender.</p>

<p><p>Texas Tornado (no longer Taz&rsquo;s Texas Tornado) was not running while I was in the park. Actually it was running, but with no riders.</p>

<p><p>These are pics for my book, <em>Rob&rsquo;s Rollercoaster Roundup</em>.</p>

<p><p>Some days ago, I put $1500 into a discount brokerage in order to purchase FlashNet stock when it debuted yesterday.</p>

<p><p>Because it&rsquo;s an internet stock, it&rsquo;s considered volatile. Because it&rsquo;s volatile, I was not allowed to place an order at <em>Market Value</em>, which means, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what price, just buy it.&rdquo;  So I said, &ldquo;um, how about I&rsquo;ll buy it if it&rsquo;s less than $25.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Yesterday, FlashNet opened in the primary market at $17. That&rsquo;s for the homies who know the right people to buy it at the initial offering price. It hit the secondary market at $39. So my order did not go through. My inner guidance suggested that I just let it go for the day and order some again today.</p>

<p><p>I just called and spoke with L__ at the brokerage L asked how many shares I wanted.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I want as many as I can buy when it opens.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>L said okay, at what stop limit? (highest price the customer is willing to pay)</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what price.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Nope.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So wait, if I say, I want it if it&rsquo;s below 1 million dollars per share, I&rsquo;ll get 1 share, but only if I have 1 million dollars in my account.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Yup.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;And if I say I want it at whatever price, you say no because it&rsquo;s volatile.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Yup.</p>

<p><p>[sigh] &ldquo;Okay, gimme however many I can get if it&rsquo;s less than $50 per share.&rdquo;  (Current market value is $44)</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That will be almost 30 shares but you&rsquo;ll owe us $12 commission.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I assume you cannot spot me twelve dollars.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>L laughed.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not entirely joking; if you can do it, I&rsquo;ll be glad to pay ya back.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to pay us within 3 days.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So I could just drive over with a check and it&rsquo;s all good?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You could even mail it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>So there it is; I made my order and US markets open in 40 minutes. We&rsquo;ll see what happens.</p>

<p><p><b>STATE OF MY LIFE</b></p>

<p><p><ol></p>

<p><p><li>I&rsquo;ve been pretty busy with actually working for a change of pace.  Dude and I have been pulling cable (installing telephone and data cable into offices) for a friend, and have been doing some website stuff.  We&rsquo;ve got a client who would like us to build a site on which he can maintain a database so he can access it from the web.  We&rsquo;ve never done something like that, but we&rsquo;ll learn how.</li></p>

<p><p><li>Plans are moving forward for <em>Rob&rsquo;s Rollercoaster Roundup</em>.  This, as you may or may not know, is my large full color coffeetable book of many many coasters that I will ride beginning this summer.  So far I have purchased a scrap-book-sorta-thing to make the template for the real book, and have an Six Flags Astroworld Season Pass, which will allow me to enter any Six Flags park this summer.  Cool!!  Astroworld opens on this Saturday.</li></p>

<p><p><li>I&rsquo;ve been enjoying DJ stuff at KTRU!  Today I had to turn on the station, as there had been no DJ there from 1 to 4am this morning. I had my trusty DJ Manual to figure out how to turn the transmitter on, but I couldn&rsquo;t make sense between the book and what I was seeing on the console. Some of the buttons the book referred to were there, but many were not.  Hrrmmmmm&hellip;  I spent literally like 12 minutes not being able to get it started.  (How does one turn on a radio station??)
<br>I was just about to call the DJ Director when I saw a small note on the bulletin board by the console.  It said something like
<br><pre>
          TO TURN THE STATION ON:</p>

<pre><code>  we now have a silence detector hooked to the transmitter
  to turn on the station, just turn on the mic and speak
  into it. You should hear your voice over the monitors.
</code></pre>

<p></pre></p>

<p><br>Ack. ohmygoodness that was easy.  I turned on the mic and <em>bing</em> the station was on.  <em>YIPES!!!</em> I didn&rsquo;t have a disc ready to play or nothin&rsquo;!  Certainly no one heard me log on, though; there had been static for the previous 3 hours (unless they had heard the previous DJ state that the station would be back up at 4am and tuned in specifically to hear that.)
<br>Unfortunately, due to my not being ready and stuff, I didn&rsquo;t record on tape my debut Station-Turn-On-Sequence.  Oh well.  I thought about doing the sequence again and recording it, assuming no one was listening anyway, but chose not to.</p>

<p><p>I did relatively well this time, and felt more comfortable on the mic, but not perfectly so.  I recorded most of the times I was on air, but (ironically enough) didn&rsquo;t record the ones where I made errors, because I was in the process of making errors and not turning on the tape. I&rsquo;ll get this figured out soon.
<br>if you don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m on Thursdays from 4-7am CST, also on the web at <a href="https://www.ktru.org">www.ktru.org</a>
</li></p>

<p><p><li>I put $1500 into the stock market. Actually I have the dollars in an account waiting for the IPO of FlashNet to be sometime next week I believe.</li></p>

<p><p><li>OH OH OH!!!  Many people have been calling me from all over the country, but they&rsquo;ve all reached the wrong number.  ??  I finally got a guy to tell me what he was trying to call.. A bank&rsquo;s 800 number has apparently been pointed to my home phone!!  I don&rsquo;t know how long this will last, but email me if you want the number.</p>

<p><p>I called my local phone company who tracked down the phone company that owns the 800 number (and who is charging the bank for calls made to my house).  I called the 800 number owning company, but can&rsquo;t get through.  &ldquo;All of our agents are busy; please leave a message&hellip;&hellip;..  &hellip;.This mailbox if full.&rdquo;  [click]</p>
