<p><p>I&rsquo;m not sure if this will work correctly, but I&rsquo;ll try it.</p>

<p><p>For the last 90-few days, my computer at work has been helping with the <a href="https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/">Seti@home</a> project.  The idea is that astronomers have collected a lot of data, hoping to find signals from alien life.  To help the search, people can volunteer their excess computer resources to dig through the data.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m putting this snapshot of my ranking in my journal because I have just found that I can use my linux machine at home to search data as well.  AND, my linux machine does it a lot faster than this machine.</p>

<p><p>I will encourage Dude to use his machines at home to do the same.  We can start a team called MR Laboratories!!!</p>

<p><p>I just unicycled around the block!!  I did it in only 2 starts!!
Actually it took 4 starts, but 2 of them resulted in immediately
dismounting (falling off;-).</p>

<p><p>ps: I have noticed that a lot of my journal entries are short, and

<p><p>I think it will be relatively simple to add this feature; although
it <em>might</em> slow down the script a little.  (Depends now how well I can
write it.)</p>

<p class=date>7:17am CDT Thursday 18 May 2000</p></p>

<p>I love summer!! I love the warm weather and I love the sun so early
in the morning!!  Before 7AM, sunlight streams through our bedroom window,
providing warmth and happy energy!  Summer is great.

<p>Today I go into work a bit early so we can interview Duane at 9am.

<p>I wanna send The Feel Good Net today... but I can't find my deck of
"52 Special Traditions for Family and Friends" I'll look some more
this morning.  The Feel Good Net is <a
href="https://fgnet.listbot.com">here</a>

<p>- - -

<p class=date>7:58am CDT Thursday 18 May 2000</p>

<p><p>How very interesting.  I asked Wende if she had seen the 52
Tradition Deck, and she had not.  Instead she offered one of her
family&rsquo;s traditions, so I typed hers into The Feel Good Net.  As soon
as I finished, I looked over at on of my desk drawers and opened it.
The deck was right there.</p>

<p><p>Too perfect to be coincidence; it&rsquo;s called synchronicity.</p>

<p class=date>7:20am CDT Wednesday 17 May 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Super duper special thanks to Amanda for helping me figure out the
NAIC (National Association of Investment Clubs) accounting stuff.  My
part of the accounting is now up to date.  (I hadn&rsquo;t recorded anything
from the first 3 meetings)</p>

<p><p>(for the long-time reader, Amanda above is different from Amanda
who I dated.  Above is Amanda G, who you may have met at UH.)</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>Today is Wendesday, but not KTRU day.  My new KTRU shift if 7 to
10pm Saturday night!!  To me, this kinda means I&rsquo;ll be at ultimate at
UH each Saturday.  Maybe some of the ultimate peeps will listen before
the games!</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>Work yesterday was cool, but I&rsquo;m stuck on one little thingy&hellip;  The
administrator of our database is allowed to change people&rsquo;s names and
emails in the database.  That was easy enough to code.  Now I&rsquo;m adding
the simple check to see if the &ldquo;new&rdquo; name is already in our database.
If so, produce an error message and do not add the name.</p>

<p><p>Part of the trick is handling multiple record changes at once.
Admin is allowed to select any number of names and change any or all
or none of them at once.  I need to change the ones that can be
changed, not change the ones that already exist, and if there were
some invalid names, show that list and the reason it was invalid.</p>

<p><p>The way SAS passes variables between screens and from pre-processor
to processor is the trick for me..</p>

<p><p>Enjoy your great day!!!!</p>

<p class=date>11:11pm CDT Wednesday 17 May 2000</p>
<p class=note>(My 11011th day)</p></p>

<p><p>Work was cool; with help from Kevin I finally am one tiny bit away
from finishing the coding I&rsquo;ve been working on for 3 days. I just need
to do final testing tomorrow.</p>

<p><p>Also tomorrow, we&rsquo;re going to interview a guy (Duane) to hopefully
take over as network administrator.  I was originally hired into the
position, but I have found that I enjoy programming more.</p>

<p><p>At the end of work, I switched two CD Rom drives - removed from
Karla&rsquo;s machine the one that is a CD writer, and replaced it with just
a normal CD Rom.  Put the CDW into a different machine.  Karla didn&rsquo;t
want to be kicked off her machine each time someone needs to burn a
CD.</p>

<p><p>- -</p>

<p><p>After work, I said HI to youth at Diedrich&rsquo;s Coffee - it was the
reincarnation of Wednesday Night Dinners, spearheaded by Ryan.  Props
to him for getting a great turnout!</p>

<p><p>I didn&rsquo;t stay long; I was s&rsquo;posed to meet Wende at home at 7:00pm.
I didn&rsquo;t even leave work until 6:39pm.</p>

<p><p>As I was leaving, I saw a familiar face from UH&hellip;  <em>What&rsquo;s her
name????</em> I strained my brain for a moment, but couldn&rsquo;t think of
it.  I walked up, and she recognized me as I said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember
your name&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>(Maggie and Molly, guess who it was!)</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Diana&rdquo;  (ha ha too late)</p>

<p><p>Big hug to her and we talk talk talked for a bit&hellip; but speaking of
late I was so late for Wende by the time I left.</p>

<p><p>Upon arrival home, I cleared with Wende - told her I was late
because I chose to say HI to Diana who I hadn&rsquo;t seen in 5 years.</p>

<p><p>Wende said she wanted me to have called when I knew I&rsquo;d be late.</p>

<p><p>(The grand irony of being late and clearing with Wende is that part
of the conversation with Diane was how well Wende and I communicate
and clear up problems between us.  I am so thankful for me an&rsquo; Wende&rsquo;s
relationship - that we are able to truly communicate openly and
quickly and effectively!!)</p>

<p><p>- -</p>

<p><p>At dinner of pasta and salad (lovely, just lovely) and then off to
Wendesday night ultimate.</p>

<p><p>I got to the field at 8-something and played only like 1.5 hours.
Super fun, and I had 1 great almost catch, and then several pretty
good catches and throws.</p>

<p><p>Good night!!</p>

<p class=date>12:38am CDT Tuesday 16 May 2000</p></p>

<p><p>I just got home from Negativeland concert. <em>TRUE FALSE</em>
tour. Wow.  Overload.  What is music?  What is information?  Overlays.
Video collages.  Sound collages.  and loops and loops and loops and
loops and loops and loops and loops and loops and loops</p>

<p><p>The show began with a cross-dressed man, happily recounting in
first person the brutal story of mother spanking her child, already
covered in 3rd degree burns.</p>

<p><p>From Sound of Music, mixed with ZZ Top&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sharp Dressed Man&rdquo;, shredding &ldquo;A few of my favorite things&rdquo;
<br>When the bee stings..
<br>I just remember a few of my dog bites..
<br>And then I start feeeling&hellip; baaaaaad!</p>

<p><p>Female gymnasts video overlayed with close-up of meat grinder churning</p>

<p><p>Disembodied head on TV telling a story from living in a sewer,
turning invisible, stealing a vacuum cleaner, cleaning up dog juice,
turning invisble again to return the vacuum, returning happily to his
sewer.</p>

<p><p>Shreiking squeaking feedback.  Intentionally melting film in the projector.</p>

<p><p>T-shirts: &ldquo;Christianity is Stupid.  Give up.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>You would have hated it.</p>

<p><p>Commercials mixed and remixed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to teach the world to
sing, in perfect harmony&hellip; I&rsquo;d like to serve the world a Pepsi&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Information overloaded me at the end.</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>Before the show started, I hung out with Mondro and Vikki outside
in the sun.  Bought a book &ldquo;Tales of a Punk Rock Nothing&rdquo; self
published and signed by the author for $8.</p>

<p><p>We were near the last of the pile going inside, but were able to
find 3 seats together.  Then Alexis walked by (she helped set up the
show) and I jumped up to give her a hug - so happy she hadn&rsquo;t left the
country for a year without me having a chance to say Bye.</p>

<p><p>Got to sit by Alexis way closer up, near the projectors in the
middle of the audience.  Cool to watch the Negativeland peeps cue up
the loops of film, yank them in and out of focus, point the images
around the stage, flutter hands in front of the projector&hellip;  Shredded
art.</p>

<p><p>I almost left before the show ended.  But it ended first.  Hugs to
Alexis and then purchased milk and cereal for Wende&rsquo;s breakfast
tomorrow morning.</p>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s 1am; I&rsquo;m going to bed.</p>

                        <p><title>Dude</title>
<p class=date>7:22am CDT Monday 15 May 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Yesterday after meeting Wende for lunch at Container Store, I
stopped by Dude&rsquo;s to pick up a Perl Programming book (he got for $5 in
the no-longer-the-latest-and-greatest book section of Micro Center),
and 2 pictures that I had left there while scanning them.</p>

<p><p>We were just BS talkin&rsquo; while watching the amazing skillz of NBA
players on TV.  He talked about wanting some inline skates, and I
suggested we go to Montrose Skate Shop.  &ldquo;Cool.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Wanna go right
now?&rdquo;  &ldquo;Sure!&rdquo;  and we left.</p>

<p><p>Montrose Skate Shop didn&rsquo;t have exactly the size Dude needed, but
we hung out with John (who owns and runs the place - has been there
for years, not making a dime he says) and talked a bit outside by the
trampoline, BBQ pit, junk cars, and sprawling tree house, all amidst
scattered indoor and outdoor toys.  They started talking cars, and
mentioned a beautifully rebuilt 1967 Land Rover being sold on
Westheimer for $15,000.  Dude is kinda looking to replace his truck,
so we went out to see it.</p>

<p><p>Land Rover is certainly beautiful, with all new parts, new paint,
removable hard top, windshield that will lay forward onto hood, and no
air conditioner, and steering wheel on the right hand side.  Dude BS
talked to the seller, but basically Dude is not interested in it.</p>

<p><p>Then off to look for more skates, this time at Oshman&rsquo;s, which
happens to be next to Container Store.  Didn&rsquo;t find quite the perfect
skate at Oshman&rsquo;s, but we did have a lot of fun in their indoor
basketball court, playing a silly game of horse at their 6 foot
basketball goal.</p>

<p><p>We threw shots from behind the goal, bounced against the opposite
wall into the goal, crazy lay-up shots (that I have little or no
chance at making), backwards over the head shots, shots from the
opposite side of the super tall net separating the two courts, bounced
against the floor shots&hellip;  Oh! We didn&rsquo;t try a bounce against the
floor <em>and</em> wall into the goal shots.  Lotta fun just horsing
around.</p>

<p><p>Stopped by Container Store to say HI to Wende, who showed Dude that
Skandia shelving is strong enough to hold Wende standing on it.  She
was cute, so I asked for her number.  She snapped gently, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t
you ask my fiance&rsquo;?&rdquo;  (I was all, <em>ouch!  hey-that&rsquo;s-me!
cool!</em>)</p>

<p><p>Then randomly to FAO Schwarz, the biggest toystore in the world (or
so I thought)..  It is like teeeny tiny compared to the one I saw in
Chicago so many years ago..  But I got to see my friend Michelle from
way back at UH!  She was even more active in campus activities than I
- she was speaker of the (something political sounding), and was in
the Daily Cougar all the time.</p>

<p><p>Dude and I asked if she sold any Pop Rocks, and she directed us to
Candy Head Quarters across Westheimer in the Galleria.  We had 15
minutes until they close.  Cool!</p>

<p><p>Ran outside, ran across the street, dodging cars and bushes on the
other side.  Held our breath past the stinky kids smoking by the door,
and zipped over to Candy HQ.</p>

<p><p>We bought 6 packets of Pop Rocks, for 89 cents each.  And then the
avalanche started.  An avalanche of M&amp;Ms, to be precise.  They have a
display of 20 different colors.  Dude got a small amount from each
spout.  I saw the lovely opportunity for art.  The light blue spout
and yellow spout were right next to one another.  I stuck the bag onto
both at once and said, &ldquo;Dude - hold this bag to make sure it doesn&rsquo;t
fall.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>He held the bag in place; I yanked both levers as lovely M&amp;Ms
poured into the bag, making two perfectly segregated halves.  Quite
artistic.</p>

<p><p>The owner lady almost freaked, though.. I don&rsquo;t even really know
why, but I&rsquo;m sure she might have had visions of our art scattering
across the floor.  We showed her the lovely perfection, and she calmed
down some.  Even gave us &ldquo;sugar free&rdquo; stickers for the bags.</p>

<p><p>Forty Four dollars??  Wow.  Our total candy purchase was $44
something.  Basically $38 of M&amp;Ms.  Wow.  The art wasn&rsquo;t <em>that</em> great,
but I&rsquo;m sure Wende will like it.</p>

<p><p>- -</p>

<p><p>Got to Dude&rsquo;s house, where his MD wife was chillin on the couch.
&ldquo;Dr Cutie, my stomach is kinda hurting,&rdquo; he said, walking to the
kitchen.  &ldquo;Do you have your stethoscope?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s upstairs.. do you want me to listen to your stomach?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;If you would, please.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I showed Veronica the M&amp;Ms to distract her from Dude.  &ldquo;See the
lovely art here?  These are the exact colors that Wende painted my
room in my apartment.  Walls are lovely yellow and the ceiling is sky
blue.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Dude came back down and delivered the stethoscopes on the way to
the kitchen.  Walked back in a few seconds later and Veronica listened
to his stomach.</p>

<p><p>Her face contorted.  &ldquo;What did you do, eat Alka-Seltzer?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Exclaimed Dude, &ldquo;Pop Rocks!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I was impressed - she essentially got it exactly on the first guess
- I&rsquo;m sure Alka-Seltzer is the same thing as Pop Rocks, but probably a
little bit less expensive and less tasty.</p>

<p><p>She listened to my stomach as well, while I chugged the Pop Rock
concoction.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Cool - I could hear how long it takes to get down your esophagus.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Wow!  We may have invented a new medical technique!</p>

<p><p>My esophagus and I went home, where I showed Wende the M&amp;M art and
ate a packet of Pop Rocks for her listening pleasure.</p>

<p><p>Pooh.</p>

<p><p>Negativeland concert is tonight.  This is good.  I&rsquo;m going to attend.  This is also good.</p>

<p><p>Back when the concert was first announced, I was asked by the KTRU station manager if I could please help them set up for the show.  This is good.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m at work now, listening to KTRU over the web, and they&rsquo;re hyping the concert and apparently started setting up at 3pm.</p>

<p><p>I called the station to say I&rsquo;ll be there soon as I get off work!  &hellip; But they don&rsquo;t need me anymore.  Pooh.</p>

<p><p>I wanted to be needed, but I&rsquo;m not needed anymore.  I called Wende and expressed my bit of sadness to her.  She understands.  Thanks Wende.  :-)</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;ll munch dinner soon and then I&rsquo;ll zip off to the concert.  Wende&rsquo;s not interested; she thinks Negativeland is not really music.  She&rsquo;s mostly right, but it is art.</p>

<p><p>See ya!</p>

<p class=date>9:36am CDT Sunday 14 May 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Happy Mom&rsquo;s day!</p>

<p><p>I called Ma to wish her happy day; talked to her, caught up on
latest happenings and summer schedule stuff.  She&rsquo;s doing well, and
will be taking a week vacation in a couple weeks.</p>

<p><p>The study is shaping up wonderfully!  My Elfa shelves are great,
almost covered in books and photo albums and my handwritten diaries.
(I&rsquo;ve kept a handwritten diary since 1987, and have considered
transcribing a significant amount of those stories to my website.
(Vote now!  Would you be interested in Rob&rsquo;s Life from 1987 to 1997??
<a href="mailto:thunderrabbitATcheerfulDOTcom">email me!</a>))</p>

<p><p>I have been shifting my writing energy to this online journal; my
handwritten diary&rsquo;s last entry is from May 6th.</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>Last night Wende and I visited her aunt and uncle and other aunt
and 2 grandparents (I think!!)&hellip; They are all great fun and quite
funny - conversation filled with puns and inside jokes and outside
jokes; great stuff.</p>

<p><p>Then to celebrate my 11007th day with my dad and his, um, friend
Karen.  Wonderful salmon, salad, veggies and way rich chocolate cheese
cake stuff.  Wow.  Even I couldn&rsquo;t eat more than a big slice.</p>

<p><p>So so tired when we got home; went straight to bed!</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>Oh!  One more significant switcharoo in my life - my KTRU schedule is changing for the summer semester.  No longer will I be on Wednesdays..</p>

<p><p>My new shift at KTRU is Saturday night 7 to 10pm.  That&rsquo;s 7 to 10pm
Saturdays this summer on KTRU 91.7FM in Houston, or on the web <a
href="https://www.ktru.org/realaudio.html">www.ktru.org/realaudio.html</a>.
The number at the station is 713-348-5878 (713-FIT-KTRU) Yay!!!</p>

                        <p><title>Ultimate</title>
<p class=date>2:02pm CDT Saturday 13 May 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Great ultimate game today.  The field made play a bit tricky; the
grass was wet, but the ground was all hard and full of cleat-ruts.
Some suggested it was like broken concrete covered in ice.</p>

<p><p>When play began, each team only had 6 players.  Then at the same
moment, each team had 1 more player arrive.  Seven players on the
field is the norm, so we all played and neither team had subs.  (This
style of play (no substitutes) is called savage, or in this case
savage seven.)</p>

<p><p>We quickly scored 2 points, and they quickly began scoring as well.
For the first half, they were consitently 1 or 2 points behind us.  We
went into the half with a score of 7-5.  Neither team had taken their
time out.</p>

<p><p>Points began taking longer after the half, and we were tied 10-10
when the referees announced &ldquo;soft cap.&rdquo;  (Soft cap = the game is over
when a team reaches 2 more points than the current high score.)  At
the same time, we (or they; I&rsquo;m not sure) called time out.  Time out
was short, and when we re-entered the field, ref announced that hard
cap begins in 3 minutes (hard cap=next point wins). The point took
longer than 3 minutes, and we scored it.  11-10, we barely won.</p>

<p><p>All my offensive plays were good.  I never dropped the disc when
catching, and in one amazing (for me) catch, one-hander over my head,
I caught it for a point!</p>

<p><p>Defensively, I was a tad slower than the guy (Corey) I covered most
of the game.  He made some good cuts and got the disc a lot.</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>Next weekend is the finals in the tournament.  Schedule and
location will be announced on Wednesday.</p>
