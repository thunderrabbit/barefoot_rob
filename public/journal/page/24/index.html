<p>Just finished four lessons at SCC: Naoko, Liliko, Hitomi, and Yasu
each had 30 minute lessons, practicing various parts of their
presentations.</p>

<p>During the first two lessons, my nose was running like yuck.  I used a
bunch of toilet paper and tissues blowing all the snot out.</p>

<p>This morning I worked on MT3 for 1.5 hours or so, getting maybe 8
frames taken.  At this point, I am working on version 2 of the
website, which focuses on the characters making the track instead of
me making the characters make the track.</p>

<p>Men&rsquo;s group at 10:30 featured 10 or 11 men, a relatively big group.  I
had a great cry during which I realized I feel tons of shame and
sadness about how much I have <em>not</em> accomplished in Japan.  I should
be making a good living, but I am still paycheck to paycheck and it
sucks.  That is the main reason I cannot go back to US every year.</p>

<p>In other news:</p>

<ul>
<li>I will go on Monday to replace <em>both</em> fans and the battery in this
computer (MacBook Pro, 2012)</li>
<li>I have gotten more than half of the classes in AB websites to be
autoloaded per <a href="https://leanpub.com/mlaphp">MLAPHP</a></li>
<li>Will meet Tariq tomorrow to finalize(?) the specs/screens for
version 1 of ConSwi</li>
<li>In the middle of training at TY, helping Jay with that.</li>
<li>Great workshop presentation by Dora yesterday, and am inspired to do
the same myself, but $3000?  See the above-mentioned
paycheck-to-paycheck comment.</li>

<p>I was the only other man to show up for D&rsquo;s men&rsquo;s circle tonight.  We
walked to a park near his house which has a wooded area.</p>

<p>Away from the busy-ness of the park, we settled in for a meditation
and then got into my work.  Wondering how to balance my projects,
where to focus my energy, how to do the right thing?</p>

<p>The feelings of fear and sadness took me back to a time with my dad.
He told me we would make a cool project together, basically a bigger
better pinball machine with sounds and lights and ramps going
everywhere.  Holy shit that sounds awesome!  I looked forward to that
project for years until I realized it was never going to happen.</p>

<p>That feeling just sat and festered and rot away my connection to
creativity until it is just a smidgen of what it used to be or could
have been.  Why the fuck did he lie to me?</p>

<p>&ldquo;why did you lie to me???  You told me not to like, but then you lied!
It&rsquo;s not fair!&rdquo;  crying crying crying in the woods.  Gasping gut
wrenching sobbing cry with 100 tears for all the years it has been
rotting inside me.</p>

<p>Some security guard came up and told us to get out of the woods, but he gave us
space when he saw me crying.</p>

<p>Got all the tears out and then turned it into blessings.</p>

<p>I forgive myself for believing my dad could do anything.
I forgive myself for not knowing what to do at 7 years old.</p>

<p>I thank spirit for the creative connection which is fully available to
me.</p>

<p>I have my dad&rsquo;s blessing to go forward with my creative endeavors.</p>

<p>Yuck.  One of the fans on my Macbook is clattering as it spins.</p>

<p>I do not know how to estimate decibels, but it is annoying.  It sounds
about like an old hard drive.</p>

<p>I walked with Mai and Richard as they walked with Fitz.  They let Fitz
off his leash so he could run around in a fenced area, but he just
trotted around instead of doing the
<a href="https://reddit.com/r/zoomies">/r/zoomies</a> that I expected.</p>

<p>He did a good job sliding down the slide, though he was not able to go
up the slide.</p>

<p>I should have taken pictures of them.</p>

<p>I have been working on a new version of Marble Track 3 website for a
few days..  The new version completely hides the livestreams and just
focuses on the workers, the track pieces they make, and people who
helped with the project.</p>

<p>There are a few rough spots, but it will likely be up within a week.</p>

<p>I can basically tell how busy I am by how much time I (don&rsquo;t) spend
writing in my journal.  Inverse relationship between entries and busy.
It&rsquo;s not surprising, but just a thing to note.</p>

<p>Recently, my &ldquo;journaling&rdquo; has included Marble Track 3 website, and
<em>that</em> has included revamping the website a bit.</p>

<p>I usuually set my alarm for 5am on Mondays and Wednesdays so I can
leave the house at 5:45am.  This morning I turned off my 5am alarm and
planned to snooze until my second alarm, but the phone was in silent
mode so that alarm did not sound.  Fortunately, Lin had set an alarm
for 5:35.  I had already packed my computer so I got out early enough
to catch my preferred train, featuring enough seats that I can sit and
write, or snooze, which I plan to do now.</p>

<p>There is a morning exercise routine used by Japan to help build
community and health and prepare everyone for the day.  Even though it
has been used in Japan for a minute, it has not spread outside Japan.</p>

<p>Today after SOGO, Menya and Risa led us through the first stages of
changing all that.  They had multiple cameras and awesome music.
Video is coming Wednesday.</p>

<p>Mark rode 4km from the 古民家公園 to our house yesterday to meet Lin
and see Marble Track 3 in person.  He had some great ideas for MT3:</p>

<ul>
<li>Encourage teambuilding among youth by giving them a certain set of
track pieces, tools, and time limit to make a track that fits a
certain set of requirements.</li>
<li>Set my camera so the whole set is in focus.</li>
<li>Add narration or speech bubbles to explain the story in more detail.</li>
</ul>
