                        <p class=date>8:26am CST Sunday 27 October 2002</p>

<p>Haunted house last night was pretty great fun, not because it was
all soooo super scary, but because I got to hang out with two of my
great friends.</p>

<p>There were a couple of guys with really long long legs and one had
a scary pumpkin head with long craggly twisted sticks for fingers and
a scary big red tongue, not pointed, but just so big it should be
choking his breath.</p>

<p>The other guy's skull was visible; all his skinn had been removed
in some horrible accident, or due to his death many years ago.</p>

<p>Anyway, they were walking around posing for pictures and chasing
those people who showed fear.  <em>THAT</em> was the funniest part.
The silly girls would be all shrieking and running away, hiding behind
their friends or their um, friends as if the tall guys couldn't see
them wherever they went.</p>

<p>They had followers, like personal assistants to make sure that no
one messed with them too much.  The girl behind the skull was cute,
though her face was pale white with dark around her eyes like they
were sunken in hollow voids.</p>

<p>Wyatt Erp walked behind the pumpkin man, and seemed nearly as tall.
Wyatt Erp took a picture of us three with Maggie's camera.</p>

<p>This was all outside the haunted house as we were waiting for our
group's number to come up (29) on the "now serving" thingy.</p>

<p>Our number came up, and we got in line (the number turned to 30
before we got past it) where they checked our tickets and said, "if
you get scared, grab each other as hard as you can" (i.e. don't grab
the actors; you don't touch them; they won't touch you.)</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I was pretty much not scared through the whole thing, just had my
ultra alert guard up the whole way through, so that almost nothing
would startle me.</p>

<p>But the one room intentionally made to look like the bedroom from
<em>The Exorcist</em>, including the girl on the bed with her arms all
backwards like she's doing that fucked up back bend.  Plus the drawers
on the chest opening and closing by themselves was pretty good.</p>

<p>And then when leaving that room, another doll like the girl was in
that backwards-crawl up on the top of the wall.  Spooky.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>There were three haunted houses in a row, which basically amounted
to one big big haunted house with two people dressed up controlling
traffic into the next section.  When we got out of the whole thing, to
the guy at the door I was all, "so, where's the second haunted
house?"</p>

<p>"That was all of them.."</p>

<p>"Awww man...  No, I'm just kidding.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I talked to a cat sitting on a couch thing; I was directed to him
to provide feedback on the houses.</p>

<p>The guy with the lawnmower was good.  He was up on a platform,
mowing the grass, and then would push the mower up over the guests as
they walk through.  It was on chains, but yeah.  And when it happened,
Janette was all, "eeee" and grabbed onto me and Maggie.  I was all
laughing, "you <em>knew</em> it was going to happen; you knew it! [but
you still got scared...]"</p>

<p>There was a room of heads hanging from strings, all white heads in
utter pitch blackness.  I knew one of the heads would jump out at us;
I was looking for one of them to be an actual human.  But it turned
out to be a pitch black dressed human holding a head on a stick, so
the head was fake and undistinguishable from the other except that it
jumped out at us.  bwahhh!!</p>

<p>The most impressive was a guy with no shirt on, and no lower half
of his body.. speaking into a microphone randomly at us as we walked
by.  I was all, "that should be controlled by an actor so it could say
things specifically <em>to</em> us."</p>

<p>Turns out it <em>was</em> a guy in a suit.  Wow!  I could not tell
how they had removed his lower body below the ribcage.  I was
impressed and a bit disbelieving it was an actor.  But the guy on the
couch assured me it was.</p>

<p>I gave him some other ideas on what is scary to me, and even as I'm
writing this entry, I'm thinking of more stuff.  oh wait I forgot. aw
man.</p>

<p>Oh, um plexiglass floor with apparent places to walk, like stepping
stones and dismembered bodies below it.</p>

<p>He had an idea of a people mover from earth past heaven and dumps
them out into hell, but insurance prices skyrocket when they start
moving people around.  I wonder if they can make that optional, but I
guess insurance would still go up.  Pooh.</p>

<p>Cheap black plastic is good to cut in strips and dangle from the
ceiling in a completely darkened room.</p>

<p>So great that Maggie has come to visit!  Janette and I went in to
her work for some hours and cleaned up the sewing room and got some
barbecue (actually Laura has previously informed me, et. al. that it's
not barbecue unless there is barbecue sauce put on or something like
that, but I don't know what to call it otherwise) with delightfully
few utensils.  Scooping up beans with a paper plate and eating beans
and chicken with no silverware.  Good stuff.</p>

<p>Anyway, Maggie had a relaxed non-time-constrained
non-map-constrained trip up here.  She arrived around 3 pm and we
yammered with Janette for a while and I called Rocky to invite him to
a haunted house.  Didn't tell him that Maggie was in town; wanted to
surprise him.  He couldn't go on such short notice, so Maggie and I
went to Rocky and Trisha's house to say HI to them.</p>

<p>We laughed most all the way there, and had a lovely great time.
Mostly we just gossipped about Telecheck where we all met.  Watched a
bit of <em>Monsters, Inc.</em> which Brennan had on.</p>

<p>Tina P called from the San Antonio Rally; I'm so glad they are
having such great fun!  Said HI via Tina to all my peeps.</p>

<p>So awesome to see what great parents Rocko and Trisha are being.
Great to see them after so many years!</p>

Sean!!  Hugged him and now he and Janette and Maggie and I are all at
dinner before Sean goes to a costume party and we go to a Haunted
House!</p>

<p>I just added myself to the m-w Word of the Day.  I think in
addition to having the pronounciation guide, they should have a
clickable audio link pronouncing the word.  Definitely.</p>

<p>I'll email them and let them know.</p>

<p>Talking with Janette helped a lot tonight.  I'm thankful for her as
a true friend.</p>

<p>(I'm thankful also to Maggie, who is willing to drive up to see me
tomorrow.  Another true friend.)</p>

<p>Janette is doing yoga stretches now.  I'll offer to read more of
Stranger in a Strange Land when she's done.</p>

for those of you planning on "partying 'til the cows come home" on

You don't want shaving cream smeared all over the consoles?  No boob

                                      .... i thought it'd be fun to make
people extra aware that at KTRU, we expect only the most proper and polite

pistols or some band with a name like jackie-o-motherfucker, will simply

<p>Josephine, Tara, Logan, Julia, Ellen, Amanda all came over for
lunch, gossip, old picture gawking, and physics homework.</p>

<p>I'm impressed and pleased that the school is making use of internet
in what seems to be a logical way.  They have homework assignments
available via pdf files, and they can turn in their answers online.
Cool thing is that each student has basically the same assignment, but
with different numbers filled in so they can't cheat by copying
answers.  They would have to actually explain the techniques used to
get the answer.  Good stuff.</p>

<p>Tara fell asleep and Ellen went in to Josephine's room hollering,
"wake up wake up wake up!!!"</p>

<p class=date>2:14pm</p>

<p>They just left and I've mostly cleaned up the kitchen after they
left it a mess.</p>

<p>Today I suddenly was missing <a href="https://www.ktru.org">KTRU</a>
a lot, so I turned them on via their internet stream.</p>

<p>Listened to a few DJs that I don't know at all or don't really
know, and then Meg and Heather came on.  I know Meg; she's the DJ who
took my application when I turned it in all those years ago.  I know
Heather; she was the station manager at that time.</p>

<p>Anyway, I called them to say HI and during the conversation learned
that today is Meg's birthday and that she was born in 1976, year of
the dragon.  I was all, "uh oh, according to the Chinese calendar, you
and I won't get along <em>at all</em>."</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"yeah."</p>

<p>"Hmm.  Well, Dragons are better than dogs."</p>

<p>"Dragons are <em>bigger</em> than dogs, but not better.  Dogs are
loyal and.." I cut myself off.  "Wouldn't it be funny if during the
course of this conversation it went to shit and we hated each other
after that?"</p>

<p>"Definitely."</p>

<p>"Dogs are loyal and obedient.  Dragons are big and scary."</p>

<p>"Does it say that?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure it doesn't say that about dragons, but .. I'm saying
that [as a dog]."</p>

<p>I subsequently invited her to my 12,000th day party.  It will be a
blast.</p>
