<p>We&rsquo;re on Narita Express now, headed to Shinagawa.  Yay!</p>

<p>I wish Fred were with us.</p>

<p>Dang there seems to be no electrical outlet near these seats.  I
thought we had outlets when we to NEX to the airport.</p>

<p>Bah.  My computer battery is dying like a boss while the image import

<p>Yahoooooo!  Narita Express does have outlets&hellip; they&rsquo;re right on the

<p>Yay!  Upon our arrival in Narita, though Lin declined to be on camera,
the guys from Tokyo TV interviewed me again!  Fun!  I wonder if
they&rsquo;ll actually follow me around at some point.. I imagine that would
be a really interesting experience!</p>

<p>Watched <em>The Peanuts Movie</em>; it was cute and great!  I liked how they
brought in all the old stories and combined them nicely into a nice
believable story.</p>

<p>Watching 007 <em>Spectre</em> now; slightly less believable.  ;-)</p>

<h2 id="12-51-wednesday-03-february-2016-jst">12:51 Wednesday 03 February 2016 JST</h2>

<p><em>Spectre</em> was pretty okay, though the video started to skip near the end
so I turned it off and turned on <em>The Martian</em>, which I really
enjoyed, partially because it stars Matt Damon.</p>

<p>Just under 2 hours to Narita.</p>

<p>We perfectly made our connection in DFW, but I was a little bit sad we
didn&rsquo;t see Mom, who said she may be able to meet us in the airport.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s about 1am in Tokyo now, so I&rsquo;m going to go to sleeeeeeppppppppp.</p>

<p>Good morning!!!  I woke up a couple of times during my anti-jetlag
sleep to drink and eat, but slept pretty well overall for the past 7
hours, and now I&rsquo;m awake for Wednesday in Tokyo.</p>

<p>Right now I plan to draw some drawings, which I have not yet done at
all during our trip.</p>

<p>After receiving an email from Emily
to see if I was interested in moving ahead with my
Soomla account, I wrote to her:</p>

<pre><code>HI Emily!

I just looked at your top page (soom.la) and see a weird image
near the bottom with significant typo and something that makes no
sense to me
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://netlify.scdn4.secure.raxcdn.com/52f05a92bec4f022a3483fcafe62636f5ba91855/68e2a/images/action-picture.jpg" alt="Welcome Abroad" /></p>

<pre><code>both 'Welcome Abroad' and 'generous today&quot;generous today' seen[sic]
strange enough that it reduces the perceived quality of your site
and therefore product.

Anyway, that's just some feedback if you like.
</code></pre>

<p>She replied back to thank me and said she&rsquo;d have it fixed right
away.. I thought we&rsquo;ll see, but a couple days later, it&rsquo;s essentially
fixed!</p>

<p>Wow it&rsquo;s the last day of the month!</p>

<h2 id="1-20-monday-1-february-2016-cst">1:20 Monday 1 February 2016 CST</h2>

<p>Okay Fred and I have been up playing Minecraft.</p>

<p>Before that, we ate ice cream, and before that, we went to H.E.B. to
get ice cream and fun toothpicks.  Before that, we ate at Serranos
(sp), and before that we took pictures after playing Sorry!</p>

<p>Before that, we hung out in the garden and I climbed the tree in the
front yard.  Before that we sat with the dogs on the stairs after
arriving at Dad and Karen&rsquo;s house.  Before that Fred drove us here,
and before that we said bye to kT at First Church after saying bye to
the YRUUers there after saying bye to Jackie and Paul after saying
Hello to the YRUUers after arriving at the church after getting
overnight stuff at Ma&rsquo;s apartment after eating at Magnolia Grill with
Jackie, Paul, kT, after hanging out at Ma&rsquo;s apartment after Paul and
Jackie came, after kT arrived after 10am.</p>

<p>or something like that.</p>

<p>After the wedding ceremony, we all headed to steak dinner at McCormick
and Schmicks, where we were all graciously hosted by Ma&rsquo;s friend
Susan.</p>

<p>Super cool that kT and Susan have (had) jobs in similar sectors so
they chatted in secret code about that for a while.</p>

<p>Susan has written a book called <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Bench-Pressed-Recounts-Blessings-Lessons-Immigration/dp/1475975422/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top?ie=UTF8">Bench-Pressed</a>, which she felt
compelled to write after serving as a judge within the immigration
system in the US.</p>

<p>Lin got sirloin steak (which she said was over cooked though she asked
for medium rare) and I got parmesian chicken.  Most of us got crème
brûlée for dessert.</p>

<p>Susan dropped me and Lin off at Ma&rsquo;s apartment, and I guess dropped
off Ma at her car at her apartment complex.</p>

<p>I confirmed with Jackie that kT is in town and may meet us in the
morning when Jackie and Paul come take us for breaky!</p>
