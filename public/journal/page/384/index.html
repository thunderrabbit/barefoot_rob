<p>So great to see Jacke Purdy tonight!</p>

<p>She came a few hours ago, just after Jack, Tyler, Skyler, Casey
went to see Godspeed You Black Emporer in concert.  Nice.</p>

<p>Jackie has two eyes tattooed on her lower back.  Nice.  Now she has
eyes on both sides of her.</p>

<p>Her Spring Break is just ending.</p>

<p>She's in a one act UIL play (Dance at Luthisana (sp)) and can't cut
her hair before then, but she's wavering between cutting it short
again and not cutting it short again.</p>

<p>They have a public performance in late late March or early April.
Email her for details if you wanna go.  Or email me and I'll forward
it.</p>

<p>Janette and I walked around, including going to the park and
climbing on a tree.  I jumped between branches and slightly scrape/cut
my stomach on a small nub of a branch.  Cut it through my shirt so
that's pretty cool.  Two slightly bloody scrapes.</p>

<p>We played king of the hill on a concrete thing with a manhole cover
on it, but the manhole cover was not exactly stable so I moved us to
play king of the patch of green grass so we wouldn't fall through the
manhole and die.  Janette won pretty handily on the concrete thing
since I was being way careful.  We were about matched on the grass,
but she got conked in the chin by my shoulder so we quit and I
piggybacked her out of the park.</p>

<p>Fucking pissed at fucking shitface email bullshit on my fucked up
Macintosh craphead computer.</p>

<p>It suddenly wouldn't send email and I erased the account which
fixed it last time and ultimately did not lose any of my stored
mail... but this time it fucking ERASED all my Sent messages, all my
Inbox, all my Deleted messages.  I'm *PISSED* at this motherfucker.
Upgraded to OS X.2 to keep from having problems with this email piece
of shit program and it's fucking destroyed all my messages.  Fuck fuck
fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.  Piece of fucking fucked up shit
mother fucker.</p>

<p>And I don't feel better about it after ranting.  Asshole computer.</p>

<p>I did not lose messages stored in my other folders.  I'm going to
look for a backup of these messages that may have been created.
Grrrrrr.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>None found.  Fuck fuck fuck.  This may be the straw.  But maybe
not.  Grrrrrrrrrrrr.</p>

<p>Yeah; I'm going to use Yahoo! for a while maybe.  I wonder if I pay
them a dollar or two if the mail won't say "from Yahoo!" on the
bottom.  But who cares if it does?  Argh.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>The only thing that *changed* is that I downloaded an update (as
suggested by my updater program) for Java.  (Not mail, Java).  And my
updater asked me to restart my computer for changes to take effect and
I haven't rebooted it.  I'm going to reboot now and if my fucking mail
is not fixed, I'm switching over to Yahoo! or maybe Lycos.</p>

<p class=date>10:39pm</p>

<p>Well, that seemed to fix it.  Shouldn't have made any GODDAM
difference if I booted after an update like that but maybe that was
it.  Alright, fucking Mail program, you're not fucking fired, but you
got fucking close, bitch.  Fuck up again and you're getting the
axe.</p>

<p>I am going to bed now.</p>

<p>Went to see Maggie for lunch and now am at Transco Tower with Janette.</p>

<p>Aw man...  The observation deck is closed since fucking Airplane
Day.  Now think about this.  Why is it closed?  So I won't direct an
airplane into the building?  So I won't carry 10,000 gallons of jet
fuel up there and light it?  Doesn't make any fucking sense that I
can't go up because some airplanes hit some other towers.  Fuck.</p>

<p>Grrrrrrr.</p>

<p>Nine Inch Nails' backwards N is stylized and intentional.</p>

<p>A backwards N in the word GENERAL of a painted sign</p>

<pre>
RESERVED TICKETS  $6.00
GENERAL ADMISSION $6.00
</pre>

<p>is not stylized, nor cool, nor intentional (I hope).</p>

<p>It's just plain dumb!  Doesn't anyone else see the sign?  See that
the N is backwards?  Argh!</p>

<p>And then there's an EXIT ONLY sign with *another* backwards N!!
What the hell is happening to my old high school?</p>

<p>###comments</p>

<p><p><b>Name:</b> bhyllx</p>

<p><p><b>Comment:</b>
<br>I used to have a backwards N in my name, but got tired of people telling me that it appeared to intentionally stylized. It took a while to get used to the change, but as we all know, change is essential.</p>

<p>Woke up late at Maggie's, went to Mission Burrito after a driving
tour of my old haunts - apartments, house, work, etc.  Went to Paint
This! and I painted a mug for Janette and she painted a teapot.  Big
hugs and HI to Jennifer as she might be going out of business and is
trying to not take too much blame and such.</p>

<p>Went to see Suzanne and helped her friend/coworker Sharri stuff
envelopes and then scheduled to stay at Suzanne's tonight.  Went to
Hermann Park with Janette and showed her the planets on the sidewalk
and big globe on water and then walked around Miller Outdoor Theater
and took pics including two little girls climbing on the statue with
Janette.  I forgot their names, but gave their mom my card in case she
wants the pics.</p>

<p>Um,.. oh walked around the lake and saw a little kid fall and gash
his forehead a bit (good scar story that I imagine he won't really
remember (he's probably 3 years old)) (haha "gash a bit") but the mom
kept cool as a cucumber and rounded up the posse and walked over to
the hospital 1 block away.  Very convenient place to fall; good job,
little guy.</p>

<p>We walked the rest of the way around the lake and then drove to
Star Pizza to order pizza and will take it to Suzanne's.  I'm chatting
with Aisha and writing this entry at Kinko's now.  Gotta roll; feel
like the pizza is probably ready.</p>

<p>OH!!!  And Maggie was right!!  I saw Ryan (fuckin' forgot his last
name, not McCarthy) at Star Pizza!!!   She said I would know someone
there...   Wow!!!</p>

<p>Ryan Ray!</p>

<p>ps: we arrived just as the pizza was ready.</p>

<p>I worked a while this morning at Wolf Shop.  Just cleaning up with
William, who did some cleaning up, but mostly ran off talking to
people whenever he could.  New today:  I suggested repairing the dust
and scrap catcher on the radial saw so William screwed a piece of 1/4
inch plywood over the hole in the thin masonite-like stuff.  I used
some wide yellow tape to help smooth the transition.</p>

<p>Also, I plugged in the vaccuum near the other radial saw.  This
vaccuum thing proves that vaccuum cleaners don't have to be loud.  I
sucked up a lot of saw dust and some little scraps of wood that
clanked on the fan as they passed through to the bag.  Hmmm; I wonder
if that's good or not.  Probably not too good.</p>

<p>No more work likely until Friday.</p>

<p>I've wondered about going to Houston with Janette for the rest of
this week.  I'd like to see my dad, and some other cats down there.</p>

<p class=date>10:47pm</p>

<p>Just got to House of Pies.</p>

<p>Voice from behind, "what's up Rob?"</p>

<p>Phat Pat is here!!!</p>

<p>He recognized my TRIX shirt.  Thanks, Jennifer!!!</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Pat is taking a music theory class.  He'll eventually be on stage
and say, "Okay, what kind of music do you want to hear?" and just
compose an appropriate song on the fly.</p>

<p class=date>12:30am CST Wednesday 12 March 2003</p>

<p>Tired.  I slept in the back of Maggie's car on the way home.  Time
to zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.</p>

                        <p class=date>10:29pm CST Monday 10 March 2003</p>

<p>Today at work I was in a pissy rotten mood at first.  It felt like
Post Rally Depression, but I haven't been to any rallies in a while.
I looked underneath and discovered that I am feeling fear and sadness
(mostly sadness) about leaving for Japan.  Just when I'm really having
a great fun time with Janette... gotta go.</p>

<p>I mean I was like kicking the shit out of boards when they only
needed a good kick.  Or pulling finishing nails all the way through
plywood instead of tapping them backwards and pulling them out.  Or
picking up decks (3/4" plywood 4x8 feet with 1.5" thick X 6" border
around it and three 3/4" braces across the back) by myself instead of
getting help.</p>

<p>Felt better after lunch.</p>

<p>That was the lunch that we all piled into Joe's truck and went to
Whataburger and Jah-Jah paid for my and William's lunch and after
lunch William and I in the back seats of the truck laughing our asses
off after Joe hit the brakes (something one does at times while
driving) and Hector spilled his 32 oz fountain drink (no lid) onto the
floor of Joe's truck and Hector was all mad at Joe!!  "Goddammit Joe
you shouldn hid de brakes like dat" in his Puerto Rican accent.  Spill
32 ounces of coke on the guys carpet and yell at him.  Thanks for the
laugh, Hector.</p>

<p>Paul Andrews was here when I got home.  He went to get Chez while
Jack went to volunteer at Dallas Peace Center.</p>

<p>Chez and I had an adventure going to the video store to retrieve
_Say Anything_ that included the Simpson's Short at the beginning.  We
watched it on Janette's TV/VCR combo (which we brought to the store)
and decided not to get it.  Chez thought it wasn't as funny this time.
It was as funny to me, but we weren't high on no sleep when we watched
it.</p>

<p>Got A.I. on DVD instead.</p>

<p>I'm too tired to watch it now; I'm going to read _Stranger in a
Strange Land_ to Janette and go to sleeeee.</p>
