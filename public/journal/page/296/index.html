<p>I just installed the Batavia 1.5 theme.  I didn&rsquo;t like the color, but I like the design, especially the little  squares around the top of the calendar.  Dude said it&rsquo;s easy enough to change the colors, so that&rsquo;s what I did.  It wasn&rsquo;t trivial; the feedback loop took a few steps, but I&rsquo;m pretty happy with the colors now.</p>

<p>I just installed wordpress from <a href="https://wordpress.org">wordpress.org</a> at Dude&rsquo;s suggestion.  It looks pretty cool.  At first I was like, &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t no way I&rsquo;m gonna revamp all my journal shit, so I ain&rsquo;t installing fuckin&rsquo; wordpress,&rdquo; but then I thought, &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t no way I&rsquo;m gonna revamp all my journal shit, but I could start a non-journal blog on my site, just to keep up with the times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We 16 GET Teachers (GET stands for Global English/Espanol Training) all teach two classes a day on 35 days of the voyage.  During our free time we have the option of being quite busy with lectures and myriad activities on the ship.  (( One of the biggest &ldquo;problems&rdquo; on the ship is deciding what to do next!  Every room usually teems with activity. ))  Somewhere during all that (usually at night when we&rsquo;ve got several hours before classes) we plan lessons, with each teacher designing his or her own curriculum to fit the students and hopefully coordinate with the ports we&rsquo;re visiting, etc.  One basic philosophy allows the students to immediately use the English they&rsquo;re learning.</p>

<p>GET Teachers and CCs (Communication Coordinators (translators)) room together, separated by gender, with usually 3 or 4 people per room.  We&rsquo;re on the 3rd floor of the ship, the lowest level for passengers, with only crew below us.</p>

<p>Right next to my room is a Water Tight Door.  Every night it closes around 11pm and opens around 6am.   Its loud clanging rumble no longer wakes me, but simply gives me a general gauge of how much longer I can sleep.  I have a plan to stick a piece of cardboard in as it shuts to see what happens, but so far this plan hasn&rsquo;t been executed.</p>

<p>Very close to my room are stairs (and elevator) which connect all the floors, and in about 10 seconds I can leave my room and arrive on the 4th floor in the dining room called Topaz Dining.  This dining room usually serves buffet style meals in the morning and set meals for lunch and dinner.  During the set meals, we must arrive within a 20 minute &ldquo;seating window&rdquo; to make things simpler for the cooks and wait staff who really work hard to provide excellent customer service.  All the waitstaff can speak English and Japanese (at least the niceties) and their own languages.  I have learned Good Morning and Thank You in Bulgarian, Thank You in Chinese and Filipino (though I already knew the Chinese version), and I try to use the correct words depending on who is serving our table.</p>

<p>On the 5th floor is GET Street, the name of the hallway which contains 10 classrooms where we teach our lessons.  Basically there are 30 English classes a day, with each teacher teaching 2 classes.  (Adriana teaches Spanish.)  I am in GET Room 9 from 8am to 9:25am and then GET Room 4 from 9:30am to 10:55am.  A computer in each room (new for this voyage!) allows us to use multimedia during our lessons: powerpoint, music, movies, etc.  I also use it to take notes and define vocabulary words for the students and give them a printout after the classes.  The rest of 5th floor is filled with passenger rooms.  And the infirmary.</p>

<p>In addition to many rooms, on the sixth floor (but on the other end of the ship) is the GET Office where, last cruise, all the lesson planning was done.  I can&rsquo;t really imagine what it must have been like for 15 teachers all vying for time on two old PCs with a single printer and cranky copy machine.   This voyage seems to be like a transition, as some things are still done in the GET Office, but most things are being done down on GET Street.  Also on the 6th floor is Reception, next to which we usually dis/embark the ship.  Reception is staffed 24 hours and basically works like a hotel reception desk.</p>

<p>On the 7th floor most of the daily Peace Boat activity takes place.  Broadway is a large meeting room that spans the back of the ship.  Lectures happen there during the day and performances at night.  A theater is next up from Broadway where they play ping pong during the day and various movies at night.  I haven&rsquo;t played ping pong nor watched any movies there.  After that are some storage rooms and then Peace Center, which seems to be staffed 24 hours, by diligent workers who produce the daily schedule in Japanese and English and the daily paper with ship news.</p>

<p>The schedule is a monstrosity in itself, with nearly every minute of every room filled.  The schedule is quite dynamic; people come up with new activities they want to do and vie for time in various rooms.  The English schedule is usually quite entertaining with misspellings and funny translations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s 1970!&rdquo;  or &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s 21 years old!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s learning Korean drum!&rdquo;  or &ldquo;Sawing Circle&rdquo; or &ldquo;Bleak Dancing&rdquo;  &ldquo;Frag Semaphore&rdquo;  (the last two being R-L mixups) &ldquo;Scream out the name of the person you love&rdquo;</p>

<p>Next on the ship is the Free Space, next to Hemingway Bar (a piano bar).  Then there is Winjammer Lounge (variously spelled with or without a D) which is nearly as wide as the ship save for a hallway on each side.  A small gameroom and meeting room are past Windjammer, and then several nice passenger rooms.</p>

<p>The 8th floor is outside: basically the deck around the perimeter of the ship, and sports deck (above Winjammer, which sometimes gives stomp-enhanced lectures) and then a small room called T-Club next to the small weight gym), then the front deck (where we are not allowed to jump because passengers may be sleeping below).  The back of the ship on 8th floor is an always-buffet dining area called Yacht Club during the day and a Japanese style bar at night.</p>

<p>The 9th deck is near the center of the ship.  It&rsquo;s called the pool deck because &hellip;&hellip; there are two pools and a jacuzzi available when we&rsquo;re in the middle of the ocean.  The water is pulled straight up from the ocean, so it&rsquo;s the same temperature as what the fish are experiencing.</p>

<p>Next to the pool deck is Sunshine Bar, an outdoor bar by the pool.  This bar is not as popular as the others, but people often spend a little quiet time there.</p>

                        <p>##05:33 Saturday 02 July 2005</p>

<p>Hello from Le Havre, France!  This city of 100,000 features some museums and gardens, and old architecture that I can&rsquo;t name, but reminds me of old paintings.  I&rsquo;ve written more detail about our Le Havre wanderings in my journal dated July 2nd.</p>

<p>I think the last time I wrote was in Egypt (Port Said) after we saw the three Great Pyramids and Sphinx in Cairo.</p>

<p>After that, we landed in Piraeus, Greece, which was a short train ride to Athens, where I walked around alone.  I was pretty much not in the mood for chatting, though I can&rsquo;t remember specifically why.  It was probably related to issues regarding plans in Jamaica&hellip; but that is a different story.
In Athens, after visiting an old church (by &lsquo;old&rsquo; I mean 2500 years, and by &lsquo;church&rsquo; I mean rubble strewn remains of walls) where I was not allowed to take a picture of Francois sitting on the wall, I padded barefootedly around the Acropolis entrance and the Parthenon (I think) though I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to enter either without shoes.</p>

<p>I can basically understand the reason (that I heard later via rumor): the modern Greek culture desires that the ancient greek ruins be treated with reverence and respect.  No climbing, funny faces, bare feet, stuffed animals.  These are 2000+ year old works of art.  Not part of some large playground.</p>

<p>Instead of putting on shoes, I ate ice cream and wrote post cards next to a little kiosk where I had seen a rather large turtle trapped behind a fence designed to keep me out of the Acropolis (not, I imagine, designed to keep turtles in).  I took a picture of him with Francois in the foreground.  Had there been no other people around, I would have put Francois on the turtle, and then later may have regretted my decision had the turtle become frightened by my antics.</p>

<p>I felt quite better after my day alone in Athens, and after eating another ice cream.</p>

<p>Interesting things in Athens:</p>

<p>1) while sitting outside the train station, I saw two dogs running loose in the street, inadvertantly scaring pigeons and basically being happy dogs.  They ran inside the train station, barked for a bit and ran back out and down the street.</p>

<p>2) the train stations don&rsquo;t force people to buy tickets.  Bypassing the gates is a trivial matter; I don&rsquo;t know if there is some hidden enforcement that I didn&rsquo;t see.</p>

<p>3) while walking back to the boat, I saw some men with an extremely efficient way of towing illegally parked cars.  They simply remove the license plates and put a ticket on the windshield.  Granted, this can&rsquo;t really be called towing, but it achieves the same purpose.  The car owner must proceed immediately to the license plate retrieval location and pay a fine to get the plates back.</p>

<hr />

<p>In Italy, we landed on Sciliy in Catania.  From there, I walked around with Niveen, a Palestinian student who has been onboard with Elait, an Israeli student since Jordan.  ((They&rsquo;ve been telling us the horrors of the Israeli occupation in Palestine: 8 meter wall being built through villages; random checkpoints within the city with rules that change daily, forcing people to lose hours of time every day; propoganda from the Israeli government saying &ldquo;We need the wall for security against these attacks,&rdquo; when the truth is the attacks are due to the wall and the occupation itself.))</p>

<p>After wandering around the Catania fish market, ogling the huge variety of fish, eating gelati and pizza and various fruits, we convened with Audrey, Allison, Natalie, et. al. near an outdoor clothing market and chowed fresh large red and green peppers stuffed with cheese and basil and olives.  Super thanks to Audrey for expanding my brain to a new way of eating a cheap, simple, healthy, delicious meal!</p>

<p>Our group took a train to Taormina, which had been accurately described as a beautiful spot to visit.  The view from the top of the hill can be augmented with pay-binoculars for a close up view of the crystal waters and surrounding hills facing the sea.</p>

<p>We had to hurry back, so we took a taxi.  But that put us far enough ahead of schedule that we were able to stop by the beach (I&rsquo;ll recognize the name if you say it) for about 10 minutes.  The water looked clear enough to drink (though I assure you it&rsquo;s too salty to drink much) and was too cold for me to do more than wade.</p>

<hr />

<p>In Barcelona, we arrived on a Sunday, which also happened to be a national holiday.  Most of the shops were closed, but La Rambla and the main tourist places were still active.  On La Rambla, a street of kiosks and street performers, I was impressed by the ability of a man dressed like the devil: he could leap out of his box and stand on top of it for a photo, then collapse as if falling back into his box.  I was unimpressed, however, with his manners.  After seeing a couple of people come up to him for pictures, I went up and he was like, &ldquo;go away&rdquo; and then he yelled at all the onlookers &ldquo;go away!  move on!&rdquo;&hellip;  it was really strange, and I can&rsquo;t imagine it&rsquo;s part of his act.  I didn&rsquo;t give him any money.</p>

<p>Niveen and I saw the Sagrada Familia (sp) and cliimbed its 340+ steps to peer over the edges of its spiraling towers and see the continuing construction.  The church is really beautiful in its ugliness, and I must give props to the original architect for his vision.  I enjoyed running down the tight spiral steps, because it could definitely be described as dangerous, and it made me dizzy.  There is no handrail in the center: just a vertical column of a hole about a foot wide.</p>

<p>Niveen and I visited Park Guell, another fair climb to the top of its hill, though escalators are available.  (I didn&rsquo;t use them.)  From the park, the view of the city featured Sagrada Familia nestled within the smaller buildings, all surrounded by mountains in the distance.</p>

<p>We chatted about life, specifically her plans for the future and my lack of plans for the future.</p>

<p>In Le Havre, France, I am sitting now on the top deck of our ship on Sunshine Bar.  This place will come alive again in about 7 hours, when people crowd the sides of the boat for the departure ceremony.  Next stop: Norway!</p>

<p>Not just Sri Lanka, but Columbo, which is the largest city (though not the capital) in this beautiful friendly country.  The people are as friendly as in Vietnam, and the traffic is about as crazy, but with more trucks and 3-wheelers (little three wheel trucks they use as taxis).</p>

<p>The homes here are often covered in corrugated sheet metal, with patchwork quilt appearance from above.  We got a tour through a university (possibly named Kabilla) and it started raining (we&rsquo;re in monsoon season now) so little red muddy rivers formed between the trees.  We got to do some drumming with cool drumsticks with rings for the mallet part that give a good springy feel and a nice clear drum cadence.</p>

<pre><code>==========--------.=.

                |     |   &lt; --- hollow ring
                 \___/
</code></pre>

<p>The next &lsquo;workshop&rsquo; type thing was dancing, and we learned dance moves with really long names like &ldquo;tagatondata&rdquo; and &ldquo;wakaranakatta&rdquo; which we had seen before in a cool performance that I got on video (though from an oblique angle), with awesome dance moves involving legs and arms, and quite stable torso.  I really got into the dancing and got all sweaty as had the dancers.  I&rsquo;m really glad to have several new types of moves to add to my Rob&rsquo;s Crazy Dance.  Looking forward to throwing down some new moves at the next party!</p>

<p>We loaded into busses and rolled to a nice hotel with all male waitstaff in the dining area.  I actually only saw one female working there; she was working at the entrance like behind the reception counter.  Talking to some of the students who joined us from the university, I learned that parents are pretty strict with when their kids can go out.  There&rsquo;s no &lsquo;dating&rsquo; as we have in the US.  Arranged marriages are on the decline, but still common enough that they have a name for the others: &ldquo;love marriages.&rdquo;  All the women at our table were proponents of love marriage.</p>

<p>I sat next to Kapila, a professor of Russian on campus, who is the leader of the dance troup called NATANDA.  His muscle tone is fabulous; I was ready to play ball for the other team after seeing his arms!  Oh my gosh.  He knows at least three languages: Russian, English and Singalese.  Eranjala, who sat on my left knows Japanese, German, English and Sinhalese.  Wow wow wow.  I&rsquo;m wondering if I can catch up and become fluent in a few languages.  I&rsquo;ll have to work harder than I have been.</p>

<p>The dinner was lovely; various types of curry and two types of rice.  Then a cool bowl of rice, and by that I mean a bowl made out of rice-flour batter cooked in a bowl shape.  So much potential for cereal, hats, pitas, and even curry.  Dessert included a fruit salad and some kind of yummy mushy brownies and some sweet yummy custardy tapioca, plus treacle (&ldquo;tree-kul&rdquo;) a white blubbery yummy delight made with honey from a tree.</p>

<hr />

<p>The GET students did presentations on yukatas and tea ceremony and bon odori (a traditional Japanese dance).  I particularly enjoyed the tea ceremony one because I helped Suzuko write her speech before she presented the ceremony.  Most interesting is that it took three minutes for her to prepare a bowl of tea. A real tea ceremony takes two or three <em>hours</em>, and includes preparing the meal before the tea.</p>

<hr />

<p>Recently on the boat, things have settled from a hectic busy chaotic state to a busy state.  We&rsquo;ve come into a stabilized schedule and actually have a day off tomorrow.  (We have days off from teaching while in ports and the days after most ports.)</p>

<p>Last night was the last night we got to see Kamau, a hip hop artist from San Francisco who now lives in Bali. He has been presenting a workshop on poetry for the few weeks he&rsquo;s been onboard.  The passengers had an open mic night last night, and some of them wrote poems honoring his work.  Pretty fun.  He performed a rap-poem called Lone Gunman, which is raw and wild, describing the days he broke away from his crew to do his own thing: they were still into the drug scene and he was working hard to produce some records.  I recorded it; I didn&rsquo;t get his permission to transcribe it though.</p>

<hr />

<p>My underwater camera case has been a good investment.  We&rsquo;ve not gone diving, but even just in the pool we&rsquo;ve had lots of fun taking silly pictures and video of our antics.  When taking video, the sounds are quite clear. fun stuff!</p>

<hr />

<p>My GET classes (each GET teacher has two classes) are bonding nicely.  At 9:30am I meet with Cheerful Dancing Fellows, and we went up for drinks a couple nights ago in Hemmingway Bar.  Last night I met with my 12:30pm class, Happy Wonderful Girls, and I was happy to play a wonderful game of Silent Football with them!  I am honestly surprised with how quickly they picked up the game, and am really looking forward to getting some more games going with more people and more errors upon which to tattle.</p>

<hr />

<p>I&rsquo;ve recorded 4.25 cassette tapes worth of stuff; I think each tape is 120 minutes long.  One is nearly filled with conversations, including one with LeLy Hayslip, author of Heaven and Earth, which was made into a movie by Oliver Stone.  After getting herself started with the book and movie, she has started a foundation and opened orphanages and hospitals..  and all this in only 20 years.  I feel inspired that I can do great things, though I still don&rsquo;t know what I want to do yet.</p>

<p>Vietnam has been the best stop so far (Hong Kong, Danang, Singapore).  People were friendly, roads were bumpy and chaotic, little 8 to 12 year old kids hardselling postcards, silk things, tiger balm, .. anything they could carry around.  I must say they were quite well practiced with quick lines and little pouty faces that could wrench money from the coldest heart.</p>

<p>I bought custom made sandals for 95,000 d. (about US$7) and I love them. There&rsquo;s nothing to them, just leather on rubber soles and blue leather straps, but they&rsquo;re just my size and quite comfy.</p>

<p>Some of the girls were fitted for dresses, and Shawn got himself a white linen suit, and a brown linen shirt.  He said one of his life goals was to own a white linen suit; I look forward to seeing him in it!  (I can imagine Fred wearing it to the next nin concert he attends!)</p>

<p>In Vietnam, we visited a school which was built using funds from one of the previous Peace Boat fundraising campaigns.  Two rooms with blackboards and desks, plus another building about the same size, though I don&rsquo;t know what was in it.  Most impressive at that ceremony was how well behaved the kids were!  Lined up on the sidewalk, squatting and waiting for over an hour in the hot sun for what must have been a boring school-opening ceremony&hellip; without complaint! I was completely impressed and amazed at their remarkably good behavior!</p>

<p>After the ceremony, GET teachers visited the classrooms and had a spontaneous lesson in each room: greetings in one and &ldquo;head shoulders knees and toes&rdquo; sung in the other.  After that, we chowed lovely delicious fresh fruit and for the first time I had something called michi (in Vietnamese, I think) or jackfruit in English. Maryann suggested that it looks like yellow peppers, which seems more accurate that banana peels, which is what I suggested.  The teachers seemed well-divided between love and hate on the jackfruit debate.  I joined the love team and chowed probably 6 of them.  (on top of the pineapple slices and some of the little fruits that janette and I encountered in Hawaii).</p>

<p>A river was discovered nearby the school and Greg went for a swim.. the rest of us cheered him on and a couple people waded.  I monitored my brainwaves&rsquo; disgust at the motorboat (engine enclosed in a wooden box on a mere large wooden canoe of a boat) being used to ferry people and bicycles across while people swam in the murky water, plus a woman on the side washing her fresh vegetables (leafy greens) in the water.  Memories of Carla&rsquo;s adventure along the Ganges in India make my story a well-cleansed hospital in comparison, but still.  Eww.</p>

<p>That night we got a hotel for US$4 per person, and we each got our own double bed!  Fun wandering around Hoi An again and I went to be early so I could have more of a day to myself the next day.</p>

<p>I woke up early and went to see Tam and asked her to get me a motorbike driver for the day.  We negotiated a bit to get me a good price that included going back to the ship (near Danang in Tien Sa).  Basically US$6 for all that.  Not sure if it&rsquo;s the best price ever, but I was certainly happy with the arrangement.</p>

<p>Ninh (pronounced somewhere between &ldquo;nun&rdquo; and &ldquo;non&rdquo;), my driver, couldn&rsquo;t speak a lot of English, but we got around fine: he took me to a nearly private beach where I indulged myself with a foot massage, mango shake and fresh pineapple, 40,000 d., 5,000 d. and 5,000 d. respectively.  The pineapple was sold to me by a young boy named Long (&ldquo;my name Long; you remember Long.&rdquo;) and I absolutely didn&rsquo;t want the pineapple, given that I wasn&rsquo;t hungry and just wanted to stroll around the beach alone.  He asked for 15,000 d. at first, but finally dropped his price to 5,000 dong (US$ 0.33) and I still said no.  He offered to take my picture, an offer I accepted, and I don&rsquo;t know if he intended to ask me for money, but I gave him a dollar for his efforts and a hopeful intention that it would in fact help his life.</p>

<p>I headed back to the roofed area and was presented with the opportunity to buy more things (massage, shake, bracelets).  I ended up paying way too much for the bracelet (sucker!) but the rest was lovely.</p>

<p>We headed back by way of a cafe, or maybe the cafe was first, but in any case, the very coolest thing occurred: I spoke Japanese with a Vietnamese waitress in the cafe!  It wasn&rsquo;t much of a conversation - just when and where and how long we studied.  She had been much more intense with her studies and had more vocabulary than me, but I loved being able to do that.</p>

<p>We stopped by Tam&rsquo;s again on the way out of town, for final goodbyes.  She gave me a hematite necklace!!!  Holy moly. I was just beyond words surprised and blessed.</p>

<p>After that, Ninh took me to Marble Mountain, where marble is quarried to be carved into lions, fish, balls, fountains, Buddhas, chess sets, jewelry, plates, bowls, etc etc. He announced that he would meet me in one hour, and I must admit I felt a bit afraid that I wouldn&rsquo;t get back on the ship in time.  I visualized myself happily exchanging stories onboard, and left it at that. I bought nothing but a ticket up the mountain (1000 d. I think) and wow.  It was really cool.  I love climbing, so it was perfect for me.  Not like rock climbing with ropes, but rock hopping with bare feet.  I scampered up the large steps and got to a three way fork in the trail.  One way had a cave, and the other two ways went up (if I recall correctly) and I chose one of the not-cave ways randomly.  I climbed some more and found a cave entrance which I entered, a bit concerned about the floor as I couldn&rsquo;t see where my feet were headed in the dark, to find a standing Buddha-esque statue standing in a vertical column about 50 feet tall and 3 meters in diameter.  The walls boasted names painted or carved into the rock.  Past the statue was an opening that went nearly vertically upward (with step-like rocks that made it easy) and I ascended to a lovely view of the ocean.  Beyond lovely: it was absolutely gorgeous with gentle waves visiting the shore and a village mixed with trees and lovely plains on the other side.</p>

<p>I could have stayed much longer, but I had an appointment with Ninh and a boat, so I scampered back down the mountain and steps, barefootin&rsquo; it all the way, much to my soles&rsquo; delight.  I was offered surprisingly good prices on a waterfountain, which, if it was the actual price, and had I a way to bring it home, I would have taken her up on it.  Like US$20 for a carved marble fountain 4 feet tall and a sphere on top that spun in the water.  Wow.  A bit pricey to get it shipped home, I&rsquo;m guessing. (ps: that price might have been misunderstood or misremembered)  Vietnam is <em>definitely</em> a country I wish to visit again for a few weeks.  Camping and biking around sounds <em>great</em>.</p>
