<p>Oh, also Jason called me today, while he was bored bored bored on
his first PI case.  Watching some woman's activities if she left her
house - with whom and where did she go.  But for four hours he sat and
nothing happened.</p>

<p>Slept in today, after being out until 2-something this morning.  I
was <em>quite</em> surprised when I realized what time it was when I
left Dude's house.  We only watched Usual Suspects, and talked
computer stuff.  then Bang it was 2am.</p>

<p>The first waking task was to switch my KTRU shift with my DJ
partner Donna.  She was supposed to DJ tonight, but I realized that I
can't DJ next week because we're going to see "Ruthless."  (And I'm
excited to report that Laura will quite possibly attend!)  I'm
thankful that Donna was able to switch with me.</p>

<p>(I'll be on KTRU tonight!)  91.7 in Houston or <a
href="https://www.ktru.org">www.ktru.org</a> online.)</p>

<p>Then I visited Microcenter and purchased a hub so we can run all
three comptuers on the cable modem at once, but for some reason, only
1 computer can have the "signal" at a time.  The DHCP request fails
for the other computers.  I'm not sure what is up with that.  Is the
cable modem blocking the subsequent requests?</p>

<p>I also bought a couple coaxial accessories so now we can watch
Futurama and Simpsons on Fox while surfing.  Very nice.</p>

<p>Now I'm about to go ride my bike maybe or possibly go skate.  Then
drop by a barbecue party thing and then KTRU at 7pm.  Then ultimate at
10:30pm at UH.</p>

<p>Then tomorrow I gotta clean up the house before Wende gets back.</p>

<p>So tired.</p>

<p>KTRU was great fun.</p>

<p>A CD case in playlist had the wrong CD in it.  So when I played it,
it was the wrong song.  I noticed and switched it and played the right
song.</p>

<p>A different CD had the wrong CD review in it.  So I gave the wrong
song name over the air.  (this is not an "issue;" I do it all the
time, but this time I had an excuse.)</p>

<p>A guy called and wondered what the fuck we were playing classical
music all day for.  He was listening to the wrong station.</p>

<p>Hugged Super-Cute Erin when she came in.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Played 4 on 4 ultimate.  1 game, then played 3 on 3, using a 1/2
width field.  (long and skinny)</p>

<p>Then we (Kat, Tony, me, Will, Mike M) played disc golf.  There are
T-buildings in the middle of the field between Melcher and the power
plant.  Tony got the next hole (bird by engineering) *almost* in par.
He missed an easy putt at the end.</p>

<p>When we were next to The Satellite, I peered inside - the whole
place is gutted.  <em>Everything</em> that was not concrete was
destroyed by Allison's flood.  Arcade games, pool tables, all the
sheetrock, all the couches and wide screen TV, all the offices, all
the cafeteria, all the rest.  I almost cried.</p>

<p>(And I have not gone to see the UC underground.. but all its shit
was presumably destroyed too, and that had bowling lanes, and a lot
more offices, including my beloved SPB.  Oh shit, and the SPB TV
station.  Fuckin-A.</p>

<p>The grate was open beside Farrish Hall.  I climbed down the
ladder and went in the room under the building.  There was an open
access to the tunnels. I did not venture inside because peeps were
waiting to play golf.</p>

<p>By the end of the game, I was so tired that my score began to suck.
fortunately I was too tired to keep track.  (At the beginning of the
game, I got the 4th hole (3 legged thing behind the UC) in
par. Totally incredible!)</p>

<p>Drove home; turned the car off and slept in the garage from 3:37am
to 5:10am.</p>

<p>Still have to take a shower.  It's 5:23 am now.</p>

<p><em>Planet of the Apes</em> sucked.</p>

<p>Dude and I just saw it, and throughout the entire
movie, I was anti-impressed with everything.</p>

<p>I mean, okay, the shit cost a lot of money to make
and the cinemetography was good, but the story was
crap. crap crap crap.</p>

<p>Okay, so he goes through a time warp.  I'll give
them that plausability because I gave it to <em>Back
to the Future</em>, which, by the way, I really
enjoyed.</p>

<p>BUT (!!!!!!), <em>clocks don't know when they go
through timewarps!</em>.  (Dude says, "that's the
epitomizes the illogical nature of the whole
movie.")</p>

<p>Certainly when a clock goes through a timewarp, and
we bring it back to the starting point in space, it
will indicate a time different than a stationary
clock.</p>

<p>But when we travel with a clock through a timewarp,
the clock doesn't suddenly seem to speed up.  The guy
was going through the same timewarp.  His reality
would go the same speed as the clock.</p>

<pre>
I did think of a possible explanation for this
phenomenon:  The atomic clock signal from the US Naval
Office was still being broadcast for the 500 years
that he was thrown into the future.  The "clock" on
his spaceship was simply listening to that signal and
adjusting itself accordingly.
</pre>

<p>So he lands on a planet and it's ultimately
determined that the humans and apes on the planet are
all decendants of the spaceship that crashed while
looking for him.</p>

<p>So he uses the long life energy cells to blast the
apes and then is saved by Pericles who was 3 days
later coming through the 500 year timewarp.  Fine; I
have no problem with that.</p>

<p>So then he's all, "I gotta go back."  He's got a
cute girl ape who likes him, and a cute girl human who
likes him, and he's just saved the planet.  But he
wants to try his luck with the timewarp again. 
Fine.</p>

<p>He goes back through time into the past and lands
presumably on earth, but... it's infested with super
apes, whose past included Thade!</p>

<p>Thade was from 2500, not pre 2000.  Totally
unexplainable how that could be.  But Dude came up
with a solution:</p>

<p>Dude's explanation of the otherwise dumb ending of
<em>Planet of the apes</em>:</p>

<p class=message>When Mark Walberg's character landed
on the planet in 2500, Thade's guards showed the crash
site to Thade.  He killed them, and then got into the
ship (he told some other apes to dredge the lake,
whatever) and flew back through the time warp to
earth.</p>

<p class=message>Thade saw all the apes and monkeys in
captivity, released them, taught them how to fight and
rule humans.</p>

<p class=message>Then he flew forward in time again to
his own time and ditched the ship back in the
water.</p>

<p class=message>Then Mark Walberg went backwards in
time to a few years after Thade had arrived, and
<em>bing</em> earth is infested with apes.</p>

<p>Thank you, Dude, for explaining an otherwise
ridiculous ending.</p>

<p>After watching the monkey movie, Dude and I watched
The Usual Suspects on DVD at his house.  This was a
*much* better film than the other; the plot was
meaningful and made sense, the story lined up properly
in the end.</p>

<p>When Veronica arrived home, we summarized the
Monkey plot.  She was glad to have not seen it with
us.</p>

<p>Oh, speaking of people not having seen the monkey
movie, when Dude and I left the theater, Kristen and
Catherine (sp) were out in the lobby!!  Catherine
agreed that it was a terrible movie; Kristen still
wanted to see it.  If she did, I hope she enjoyed
it.</p>

<p>Wonderfilled Kristen-night out.  Kristen and her sister Jessica
were 10 minutes early meeting me, which maybe made up for Kristen
being 15 minutes late yesterday.</p>

<p>Picked up Catherine (sp) and then visited Whole Foods and grabbed
smoothies and some snacky food.  Funny how indecisive they were with
whether to get more food and be more late, or leave now and be more on
time.  We got more food, but weren't really late.  Were really
laughing.</p>

<p>To <a href="https://www.masqueradetheatre.com/">Masquerade
Theater</a> in the heights to see Kristen and Catherine's friend <a
href="https://www.masqueradetheatre.com/PressReleaseshow.cfm?PressReleaseID=100&startrow=7&aol=5850720&MenuGroup=Ruthless">Katharine</a>
perform in the play "Ruthless."</p>

<p>Wonderful wonderful!  I would like to take Wende before the show
ends on 1 September I think.</p>

<p>My favorite favorite scene was Katherine as Tina playing Puddles
The Dog, mocking Louise.  Very funny.</p>

<p>Afterward, we ( = Me, Kristen, Jessica (Kristen's sister),
Catherine, Ralph) all went to Spy, a nightclub that Kristen and
Catherine have worked at.  Funny:  Jessica is 15 years old.  At the
door the guy asked, "how old are you?" and she was all, "twenty," and
he goes, "that's what I thought."</p>

<p>What?  That's crazy.  Anyway, they let her in, no worries.</p>

<p>On the way out, a cop (and Kristen's friend) was all, "later, juvie."</p>

<p>We kept a close eye on Jessica ready to pounce on anyone who tried
to talk to her.  No worries the entire night.</p>

<p>When we arrived, the music upstairs was pure tight techno, while
the downstairs was hip-hop dance.  I way-prefer techno, but we danced
downstairs first.  When I got bored of that, I went upstairs, but for
some wack reason, by then they were playing the exact same stuff
upstairs.  Not like simulcast, but some of the same songs they had
already played downstairs. </p>

<p>Katherine and Allison (sp) from the show came and danced some as
well.  I danced Rob's Crazy Dance on the speaker.  Fun.  I shoulda
worn earplugs.  Actually the music was less loud as I stood on the
speaker, but I shoulda worn earplugs anyway.</p>

<p>After Spy, we visited Biba's One's A Meal.  Laughed and ate, ate
and laughed.  Katherine (without Allison (sp)) joined us there, and I
got to really compliment her on awesome performance tonight.  I do
look forward to bringing Wende to see it.</p>

<p>Pretty okay at work today.  Kevin and Karla were out for the second
day - they went to negotiate a deal with a pretty big client.  They
have 200,000 employees in the US.  I implemented some security
overrides on the G3 - the security did not allow us to log in as
somebody while that person was legitimately logged in already.  Now we
can log in as them.</p>

<p>Christi (one of our partners) gave some more suggested
modifications to the G3 yesterday and today. I got them all
completed.</p>

<p>Now we are working on a project with Cheryl as our contact - this
is for a company that wants to allow each participant to have their
own unique schedule for going through the process.  This requires some
significant tweaking of the G3 to make it work the way they are
hoping.  I have a conference call scheduled with them on 24 August,
and then I'll talk to Cheryl on 29 August and give an estimate on the
number of hours (= $$$) that it will cost to implement.</p>

<p>Should work out just fine.</p>

<p>Also, I helped Kim get his new domain registered for his personal
website.  I'll be helping him build it.  <a
href="https://www.spiritblueeagle.com">www.spiritblueeagle.com</a>.  It
probably is either not set up or just has a placeholder.</p>

<p>Hung out with Kristen tonight; we went to Souper Salad and
munched.  She told me a lot of school stories and such.</p>

<p>Hung out talking at my house until Wende got home.  Tomorrow we are
going to go see her friend Catherine (sp) in a musical.</p>

<p>Dammit!  Today is/was Jason's birthday party at
Mai's and I totally forgot about it on my way home.  I
was on my bike and crazy sweaty; I got home took a
shower and was just now reading my Friends' entries on
livejournal, and I noted that Heidi's going away party
is tomorrow night, and I suddenly remembered Jason's
party tonight.</p>

<p>I hope/expect the party was a total blast.  You
know what?  I'm going to call Jason now to see if they
are still there.</p>

<p>Doh.  They left a long time ago; he said it was all
good though.  Nice.</p>
