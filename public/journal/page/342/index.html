<p>Had a long heart to heart talk with janette tonight.  We got
sidetracked by my need to hear how unique I am and she expressed to me
some of her innermost concerns.  She said she knows in her heart that
we're not meant for each other this lifetime.  I feel sad yet know the
same thing in my heart.  But it's like how great would it be to have
found the one (sounds like Morpheus).  So close but not quite.</p>

<p>Still so looking forward to her visit.  Still so happy to have her
as a friend, island, cheerleader, supporter.  Still can't wait to see
her.  And we're that much closer now.</p>

<p>Hung out with Nami after work.  Ended up sitting for 2 hours next
to the steps leading from Kawasaki station down into Azalea.  She
really encouraged me to use Japanese, (moreso than any other teacher
has.  At the same time, she is the most English-fluent Japanese that I
know.  She's probably level 3.) and I told her in Japanese the story
of obtaining a bike, losing the bike, losing my wallet, having Koko
help me recover from the wallet loss, and her mom driving us to get
the bike.  Wow.</p>

<p>We might go to Fujiku Highland together on 12 August!</p>

<p>I told her in English the story of how I met janette and my 5000 +
6000 mile road trip.</p>

<p>Top n reasons my brother is cool:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>He sent me something in the mail</p></li>

<li><p>He reused the cardboard envelope (which Jackie had sent to me
and) that I sent to him</p></li>

<li><p>He wrote me a letter on an envelope</p></li>

<li><p>He sent a CD in an AOL CD case.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>((Now, I'm thinking that he did *not* send me an AOL CD.  Let's find out.))</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Haha.   The envelope is a barf bag and over 1/2 the words are
spelled in honor of Mark Twain.</p></li>

<li><p>The protective packaging was two AOL CD promotional
cardboard things that he got from the post office.  To decrease the
overall weight, he threw away (or microwaved) the booklets and CDs
that had been in the cardboard.</p></li>

<li><p>Wow.  The gift is _Be_ by <a href="https://www.cdbaby.com/stevefeinstein/">Steve Feinstein</a>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Funny: I put the CD in last night and my computer overheated, so I
couldn't finish the entry at that time.</p>

<p>Today I got to teach Satoko twice.  Quite nice.  I was excited to
see her name first on my schedule, even more excited to see it was man
to man.  We just chatted about whatever..  I don't remember what.</p>

<p>My third lesson was an empty sales, and 5 minutes before my 40
minutes of chillin' was to begin, Sumika came in and said I needed to
teach Satoko again.  This has never happened before, so I thought she
was asking me to fill in the file, which I hadn't (and didn't intend
to do), but then when I understood what she meant, I was like wow how
awesome!  "no problem des."</p>

<p>This time we actually did some grammar work - past perfect, "I had
been reading a book when the phone rang," and bang the bell rang 40
minutes gone in a flash, though I still intended to show her fully
100% more examples than I had already.</p>

<p>I wish all my lessons could be that fun.</p>

<p>Another success story with Yukiji, who went from nervous to "the
elephant was walking through the park when it saw the umbrella" + "the
man was selling hotdogs when the elephant grabbed the umbrella" + "the
umbrella was mounted on the hotdog cart when the elephant grabbed
it."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Satoko texted me as I was leaving work, and we are now planning to
meet before Nova on Monday.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>At home (did I just call this place home?) I showered, ate, did
email and got sick of myself on the computer, so I called janette to
read Japanese to her, but we ended up talking about our relationship
instead, and I'm glad we did.  I really look forward to her coming
here to hang with me.  We can bang around on bicycles and see
beautiful temples such; it will rule.</p>

<p>My Nova experience has been a cakewalk compared to Matty's.  He has
been continuously harassed by his bosses - for his haircut, his
posture, his method of teaching.  Recently Matty told me he's being
specifically harassed whereas a different teacher had a complaint
lodged against her, but that teacher never heard anything about
it.</p>

<p>'sreally difficult to get fired from Nova.  But Matty has been
threatened, "if you ever skip the picture speculation again, you're
fired."</p>

<p>The picture speculation I think is one of the most difficult and
stupid parts of the lesson.  Look at a picture. "What are they doing?"
"What do you think they're saying to each other?"  The students never
want to speak up; they don't have the vocab, or they believe they
might be wrong.</p>

<p>Teachers who ascend the ranks of Nova are those that are willing to
lie for Nova or to accept (or ignore?) all of Nova's lies.  Those who
are </p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Train of thought stopped when my train reached the station.
Anyway, Nova bites in many ways.</p>

<p>Finally.  Something resembling rain.  But really it was just a
heavy sprinkle for Houston.   Lasted only 15 minutes.  Maybe a 1/4
inch of rain.</p>

<p>Ironic that it's raining well after summer is supposed to have
started.  Last week they said this week.   This week they say next
week.   Oh when oh when will it get hot?</p>

<p>As we walked out of Subway, Aki began to whimper at the oppressive
heat and humidity.  I was like, "Akisan, I *love* this weather," and
she moaned some more.  I thought for a moment.  "It's like a
comforting blanket wrapped around me, keeping me warm and happy."</p>

<p>More moaning from Aki.</p>

<p>Next Wednesday we're going to see <em>Pirates of the
Carribean</em>.  I'll buy tickets on Monday so we can have great
seats.</p>

<p>Work tonight was quite fine, though I have a pretty effective
headache right now.  I'm glad I've got a seat on this train.</p>

<p>I had a level 2 then a level 3, each man to man, then a kid (man to
kid) and then two 5s, then lunch, then two 7Bs, then a break to
prepare for Club 7.</p>

<p>Club 7 is the name given to two consecutive timeslots in the voice
room (where students can just come and yammer yammer yammer, though
what usually happens (at least when I'm in there) is one person does
most of the talking (me, or a talkative student).  It's the rare
student who can have a conversation and encourage others to speak up
as well.), and is usually geared toward some topic.  Last time I did
animals.  The first part took the entire first 40 minutes: name
animals from A to Z.  I don't remember what we did for Q and X.</p>

<p>This Club 7 was on prepositions.  The structure was pretty loose
otherwise.  I split them into two teams and had one team name a
preposition, the other team name a verb, then I would name a noun.
The first team to utter a correct sentence including the three words
got a point.  1 mini point went to the team where the guy was all, "I
read a book called 'dog through,'" or something.  I got two points
when the teams couldn't produce a sentence in the (arbitrary)
timelimit.</p>

<p>That took the entire first 40 minutes.</p>

<p>Second 40 minutes started with two teams.  One person on each team
described a picture only they could see.  Their team drew the picture
from verbal cues.  One team cheated by using more than just English
(not Japanese, but gestures and postures), but it was all good.  Then
we played Pict-O-Grams.  I didn't know how it would work, but by the
end they really seemed to have had a fun time.  Happy happy joy joy
that they were all, "is this game popular in America?"  "Actually, no;
a friend of mine and I made it up."  (Thanks Bryn at OKC Rally some
years ago) They were like, "wow."</p>

<p>Pict-O-Grams:</p>

<p>Give each person a piece of paper and pen.  Each person writes a
single sentence on the top of their piece of paper.  Give the paper to
the next (second) person who will draw a picture representing that
sentence.  Each person then folds the paper so that only the picture
can be seen.  Give it to the next (third) person who will write a
sentence describing the picture.  Fold the paper so only the sentence
can be seen and give it to the next (fourth) person.  Text -> picture
-> text -> picture -> text, etc etc etc until the paper is full and
then everyone looks at all the pictures and text and laughs a lot.</p>
