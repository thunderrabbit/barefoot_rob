<p><p><font size="+1">How I met Dude</font></p>

<p><p>Back in like November, I created an ad to be placed on the back of Kroger register receipt tapes at two Krogers near my house. I&rsquo;ll scan an image of it soon.</p>

<p><p>I got this letter</p>

<p><p><hr align="left" width="50%">
<pre>
Subject:  Cool Company
   Date:  Fri, 08 Jan 1999 01:17:03 -0600
   From:  Dude Spellings <dude1ATpdqDOTnet>
     To:  thunderrabbitATcheerfulDOTcom</p>

<p>Rad (Rob) - My name is Dude Spellings, and I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice
your advertisement on the back of my Kroger&rsquo;s reciept with your cartoon
character saying my name.  Anyway, I am between jobs right now and into
designing webpages.  If you have a need for an extra web designer, I
would love to help ya&rsquo;ll out.  If you want to see an example of one of
my pages. check out my site at:
<a href="https://freeweb.pdq.net/dude1">https://freeweb.pdq.net/dude1</a>
I also have some really cool photos of my hike last summer from Lake
Tahoe to Mt. Whitney.  My website is not all that advanced and I don&rsquo;t
claim to be an expert, but I would really like a good reason to lern
more web-designing skills.  At the very least, it would be nice to make
a new friend.</p>

<p>Let me know if you are interested.  I am going to Austin this weekend
and will be back monday.  You can either respond by e-mail or phone.  My
number is 713.<strong><em>.</em></strong>_.</p>

<p>Peace,
Dude

<p><p>And then this letter:</p>

Subject:  It&rsquo;s me again
   Date:  Fri, 08 Jan 1999 01:40:28 -0600
   From:  Dude Spellings <dude1ATpdqDOTnet>
     To:  thunderrabbitATcheerfulDOTcom</p>

<p>Rob - I just finished looking at the rest of your website and have
decided that I would like to meet you regardless of is you need another
web-designer.  We have many things in common and I would like to make
more friends here in Houston.</p>

<p>A bit about myself:
- I am also around 10,000 days old.
- I have made a personal promise to myself that the next permanent job
that I take will not require me to wear any shoes aside from sandals.
- I love working with youth and am very spiritual (religion is to teach
people how to die.  Spirituality is to teach people how to live).
- One of my favorite books is The Road Less Traveled, which I believe to
be devinely inspired.  Another is The Prophet, by Kalil Gibran
- I love camping/hiking/biking and anything outdoors.
- I am married to a great, loving, and supportive wife who is also an
M.D.</p>

<p>I hope to hear from you.</p>

<p>peace,
Dude

<p><p>&ldquo;Totally cool,&rdquo; I&rsquo;m thinking, and sent this reply:<br />
<br>(this story does have a point)</p>

     Subject:  Dude!!
        Date:  Fri, 08 Jan 1999 02:09:56 -0600
        From:  Rob Nugen <thunderrabbitATcheerfulDOTcom>
Organization:  MR Laboratories
          To:  dude1ATpdqDOTnet</p>

<p>Dude!</p>

<p>Is your name really Dude?</p>

<p>My friend Marcel and I call each other Dude all the time.  Sometimes we
have entire conversations using only tonal variations of this word.</p>

<p>Speaking of Marcel, I forwarded to him your email messages (and this
one) because this connection is just to awesome for me to not tell him!</p>

<p>I super greatly appreciate that you enjoyed my ad and my website!</p>

<p>Now if someone would actually want a website, we could do some work!
;-)</p>

<p>Seriously, that ad is almost the only advertising I&rsquo;ve done for MR Labs;
I couldn&rsquo;t afford any more and I have actually shifted focus a tad; I am
now selling FlashNet accounts to anyone who needs internet access.
Happily enough, I&rsquo;m finding that I can sell internet accounts more
easily than websites, so hey - whatever works.</p>

<p>enough about business&hellip;</p>

<p>Wow!!!  And you&rsquo;re up late at night doing email just like me!  I hear
you will be out of town this weekend; that is convenient; I will too. I
look forward to meeting you probably next week!</p>

<p>I would write more but I have to leave in about 4.4 hours to catch a
plane to Atlanta.  Have a great weekend in Austin!</p>

<p></pre>
<p><hr align="left" width="50%"></p>

<p><p>That weekend, I went to Atlanta.</p>

<p><p>The following Monday, having had no further contact with Dude, I
went to a class called <a
href="https://www.jeffdurstconsulting.com/heart.htm">Project
Heart</a>. I opened the door for a guy who came in right after me.</p>

<p><p>It was Dude.</p>

<p><p>&rdquo;!!??!!??!!??!!&rdquo; went my brain.  The first coherent thought that came to mind was, &ldquo;I guess we were meant to meet.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>We have hung out and worked a lot on MR Laboratories since then; I am really glad to have Dude as a friend.</p>

<p><p><b>STATE OF MY LIFE</b></p>

<p><p><ol></p>

<p><p><li>I recently came to the realization that my life feels too busy/complicated lately. With help from Wende, I pondered this in my diary and found that back in my college days, I was busy, but not quite as busy as now. Also, back then some of my busi-ness included good exercise (Ultimate and disc golf), good friends (hanging at the dorms) and good food (dorm food is more balanced than my current eating habits)
<br>Hmmmm.
<br>Wende also pointed out that my life had 1 big focus: COLLEGE. Now I have a couple of big foci: Business/financial, Youth group work, men&rsquo;s group, my websites/email
<br>Hmmmm.</li></p>

<p><p><li>For New Year&rsquo;s I went to Northwoods Unitarian Church (the one I grew up in) for a youth lock-in. We played Sardines, Silent Football, watched movies, and made a life sized pinata of Jason Fricke!</li></p>

<p><p><li>This weekend I&rsquo;m going to Atlanta for a FlashNet conference! I&rsquo;m super excited about it; and expect to return with a plethora of ideas and energy to build my business (and my busi-ness!)</li></p>

<p><p><li>Yesterday I made some <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> page flyers advertising my FlashNet business and handed out small stacks to four different apartment complexes. They were all quite happy to put them in with their Move-In packets for all new residents! Yay!!</li></p>

<p><p><li>Manda and I recently went to see Rush Hour at the theater on family night when every seat is 50 cents! We spent an equal amount on a pinball game before the movie, and she totally kicked my ass at it! She did so well that she kept getting bonuses and extra turns and everything and it actually made us a tad late to the movie! Watching her do so well was worth the wait. Today I bought her an orange &ldquo;Push Up&rdquo; ice cream thing and a Kit Kat for myself.</li></p>

<p><p><li>It&rsquo;s after midnight and I still haven&rsquo;t packed for this weekend!!! Shannon is picking me up at 6:30am (actually her boyfriend is driving us).</li></p>

<p><p><li>It&rsquo;s one week and 20 hours until the Houston Rally and we still need 30+ registrations in order to break even. I know we&rsquo;ll do it; the forms will begin to flood in up until the last minute!</li></p>

<p><p><li>I took Spot (my cat) to the vet for his yearly check-up, and he still weighs 8 pounds just like last year!</li></p>

<p><p><li>In February I&rsquo;m going to see Jen in New Hampshire!  See, she is coming down to Houston in August to visit Rice University and I was all, &ldquo;do you realize how hot it will be in August?&rdquo;  and the conversation grew to the point where we decided to exchange cities during the most extreme temperatures of the year.  Makes sense to me!!  (BTW, today I think it got up to 79 degrees in Houston)</li>

<p class=date>30 December 1998</p>

<p>OH MY GOODNESS it's almost 1999.

<p>1999 1999 1999. Crazy. 1999 1999. 1999. sorry. I'm just practicing typing it.

<p>I had a super fun Christmas timeframe - went to my mom's in College Station on Christmas Eve. My brother Fred drove down from Denton as well. Spirits were delightful and fun with our two step sisters, Alicia and Karina (who I've known since wayyyy before there was any hint of us becoming step siblings) and their dad (Jon (that guy)) and his sister and their dad.. it was a small reunion! Oh and Karina's boyfriend Jay.

<p>Coolest thing was the "rubik's" cube Fred purchased. Remember the Rubik's Cube? 3x3x3 pristinely colored cube that one can render into a cube of confetti with just a few turns?
<br>Well, Fred found and purchased a 5x5x5 cube! Oh yes. It is amazing.

<p>If you are as geeky as us, you can get one via
<font face="arial">
<br>Dr Christoph Bandelow
<br>An der Wabeck 37
<br>D-58456 Witten
<br>Germany</font>
<br>(redacted)@ruhr-uni-bochum.de

<p>Certainly there's a URL, but I don't know what.

<p>Okay, I found a URL: <a href="https://www.puzzletts.com/search/">https://www.puzzletts.com/search/</a> and type in <font face="arial">professor's</font> for the name and it will come right up!

<p>So anyway the cube was super awesome and I pretty much played with that the whole 2 days we were there. We also watched "The Wrong Trousers" starring Wallace and Grommit, who I had never previously seen except on Mario's desk as little plastic figures. Yup Wallace, Grommit, penguin and trousers. That's hilarious stuff! I loved the train track scene. How do they make the background blur if it's stop action photography? I was quite impressed.

<p>On the morning of the 26th, Fred and I cruised to our dad's house and hung out there for the day, mostly doing computer nerd stuff as Fred has brought his scanner and printer and CD rom burner. Also invited my friend Super Dave Osborne over. He was my best friend during high school and we just walked around outside and reminisced and philosophized and climbed trees and stuff.

<p>In all, 'twas a delightful night before through day after Christmas.

                        <p><title>A Twisted Christmas</title></p>

<p class=date>30 December 1998</p>

<p><font face="arial">A TWISTED CHRISTMAS</font> read the card featuring red and white twisted glistening candy stripes. A rave on 26 December from 10pm to 6am and the first 500 people in the door get a free CD!

<p>Cool! So I drove home from my dad's and napped a bit until Amanda and Sally dropped by at 10 and we piled into Amanda's car and zipped away.. first to Walgreen's to get ear plugs which turned out to be quite useful.

<p>The line was not huge but significant out the door of Club Waxx downtown. I was much happier bouncier in line than previous raves; it was my third rave or so, but the first one that I actually went <em>with</em> someone and therefore already knew someone in line.

<p>(this entry is going way too slow)

<p>We got in a got free CDs and this was Amanda and Sally's first rave so they weren't as ready to jump out into the middle of the circle and dance as I was. Sally got a few action shots of me doing my patented "I don't know what the heck I'm doing except I'm having fun" dance.

<p>Amanda got a call from her friend Jen, who was going to join us at some point, so she left to go meet her and stuff. Sally and I watched people dance and watched the DJs spin records and were just chillin' when the music came to an abrupt halt.

<p>"Um, we're sorry to have to do this, but everyone who is 18 has to leave. The police are outside and everyone under 18 has to leave now."

<p>Hmmmm.

<p>Music resumed only to be interrupted with the same message plus, "if everyone who is under 18 doesn't leave now, we'll have to kick everyone out and check IDs"

<p>Hmmmm.

<p>Soon, that's what happened. They stamped our hands and kicked the entire rave out to simply go to the front and show IDs to get back in. Except that Sally's ID was in Amanda's car. Hmmmm.

<p>The whole process took a pretty long time and we met Lisa, Elliot, and Anu in line. Lisa was super thoughtful and gave Sally her jacket thing cause Sally had no sleeves on her outfit. We talked about tattoos and whatever until the line started moving. The dude wouldn't let Sally in without her ID, so we gave Lisa her jacket back and went looking for Amanda and Jen.

<p>At this point it was like 1am and somewhat chilly outside. We didn't find her car in the parking lot but reached her on cell phone. Turns out they had driven up and saw everyone outside and Jen didn't feel comfortable going in--didn't feel like she would fit in.

<p>After some encouragement and promises to leave if she felt too uncomfortable, we all went in. Yay! Found Lisa and Elliot and introduced everyone and danced some more. By about 2 something AM 
my knee was a bit sore so I went and sat down and actually took a nap (thanks to my earplugs) until Amanda and them were ready to go a bit before 3am.

<p>To Biba's we went (the third time I've been there recently) and chilled and talked and had a super funny fun time. As a side note, Matt Maloney of the Houston Rockets and some of his friends were there. We didn't say HI or anything.

but they are available in raw form <a
href="/images/travel/costa_rica/1998/">here</a>.

<p>Yay!

<p>Oh, I almost forgot. According to Geocities, there are 6,418,232
bytes in my Costa Rica image directory.  That's over 25% of all my
webspace on Geocities!</p>

<p>Today I am 10500 days old!  Yay!!!!!!

<p>This past Monday at I-group I realized that I felt unproductive in my life. We worked down to the base of the fear and found that I felt like I don't have enough money to do anything, including not being able to get a job. Then the fear spirals downward: no money = no car = no job = no apartment = no life = me alone with nothing in the world.

<p>"Well why don't I just get a job?" was the next basic question. Oddly enough, I'm not that desperate yet.

<p>Yeah, yeah, none of this makes sense, but the dark recesses of my brain seldom do.

<p>So the next question was asked -- one that wasn't quite as obvious to me.  "If I'm not willing to work for someone else, am I at least willing to work for myself?"

<p>Yes, in fact I am.

<p>"Are you willing to make a list of things to do, and put deadlines on it?"

<p>Deadlines?  Novel idea.  Yes, in fact I am.

<p>So I changed my mindset to one of proactivity, I made my list, starting with wake up at 8am, shower, dress, eat, make a list of things to do that day, prioritize them, designated deadlines, then work on it until 2pm.  (Gotta start slow)

<p>But I didn't start all that slowly.  I made my list that night (puttin' in overtime before I even go to work!) and prioritized it and got started on Tuesday morning with vigor and enthusiasm!

<p>I finished nine-tenths of the As on my list, plus spent 3 hours at Telecheck, talking and reconnecting with everyone.  I was greeted with nothing but handshakes and hugs and kudos and even sold some FlashNet accounts!

<p>I spent a significant amount of time talking to Donna, who seemed quite impressed with my general outlook on life and stuff. I learned that she skates some as well, so maybe we'll go skating downtown sometime!

<p>I was doubly pleased and honored when talking to Pat, she said she felt inspired by my example of getting out of debt and being able to travel. Wow!! I felt so good and encouraged her to follow her dream: "you can do it!"

<p>Then I drove way over to the east side of Houston and picked up some ceramic "bricks" for my gas heater.  They were $14.98 each!  I bought 3 to replace the ones that have cracked and broken over the years.

<p>It was fully 3:30pm when I got home, and I took a happy nap with my rennovated heater.

<p><hr width="30%">

<p>Today I have been working on the Bs on my list, including ordering plane tickets via Jayne my travel agent to go see Jen in New Hampshire, via the aiport in Manchester, via Newark, NJ, via Continental Airlines!  Yay!  That will be in Feb 1999.

<p>And today I scanned some pictures...

<p class=date>21 December 1998</p>

<p>I am sure I mentioned previously that I applied to be a DJ at KTRU. I never heard back from them until I got this letter:

<p><font size="+1">
<b>To:</b> thunderrabbit@cheerful.com
<br><b>Subject:</b> KTRU Application

<pre>
hi, i am ellen's sister and i work at KTRU (i actually was the one 
who opened the door for you, although i didn't know it was you).  i know 
your brother, fred, although he always confuses me with a girl named lee 
meredith, and i also know mike ossowski (he doesn't confuse me with 
anybody) and perhaps other YRUUers that you would know.  anyhow, i am 
emailing you so that you do not get discouraged about your KTRU 
application.  the dj director either did not have enough time to hire 
for the christmas break, or didn't feel that we needed any new dj's at 
the time (my guess is the former, since we will be off at night 
probably).  i will make sure that your application remains on file for 
consideration in the spring.

good luck,
meg

<p class=date>1:11pm Saturday 19 December 1998 (10496)</p>

<p><br><font size="-1">(transcribed from my diary)</font></p>

<p>I just spent 2 hours online doing email and updating website and the SWD YRUU website.

<p>Yesterday was asesome! To kick it off, Glen called me back and was super exciting about signing up with Flashnet!  yay!!

<p>Then Ben Easton and I went skating around Rice University, got kicked off (gently) by a Rice Cop and went to eat at Bibas and discussed Y2K predictions, and our philosophies of god and cosmology. Ben explained logically why angels exist, but that god does not.

<p>Then to his house with the plan of some combination of talking, or watching <em>2001: A Space Odessey</em>, which he could hardly believe I had never seen.  (He has a framed poster for the movie in his living room)

<p>We talked for 2.5 hours, actually mostly he talked and described long windedly why he is for the death penalty. Something to the effect of, "it's our right to remove people who are a threat to society."  I debated, but didn't seem to make much of an impression.

<p>Then I went home a chilled a bit then met Sara at UH for an AH (American Humanics) party at the UC (University Center).  I met James and talked to him and we helped them get set up including walking to the Social Work building where AH is located via a semi-secret back door of the UC, labeled "Emergency Exit Only"
Much to people's surprise, there is no alarm on the door and we propped it open with some flyers so we could get back in.

<p>Back to the dance for an awards ceremony, then jazz music (ho hum) then Beastie Boys "Brass Monkey" which got me and Sara onto the dance floor then "Paul Revere" then some disco and by then a lot of the group was up dancing and we formed a Soul Train dance line and had a great time.  I even got Tinette's grandma to dance!

<p>I danced bouncily for like 1 hour including non-stop bouncing on my toes to the beat of House of Pain's "Jump Around" for the entire song.  <font face="arial" size="+1">GOD</font> my calves are sore!

<p>Left the party and called Manda who was still out and about. I almost went back to the party as a "poor me" reaction then realized that's not what I wanted. So I went home and put on my skates to skate downtown.

<p>It was 11pm, and I suddenly thought, Diane! and called her and turns out she was available to skate so we met downtown at our parking lot. I skated there and she drove.

<p>We skated around the streets, which was a tad challenging as they were a tad wet, and wound our way down to Bayou Place, (a brand new facility, including sweet movie theaters, 2 or 3 restaurants, a concert auditorium, a bar or 2, and valet parking, which is Houston's wonderful successful beginnings of getting a night life back downtown) and asked one of the outdoor bars for water and they were happy to oblige.

<p>We chilled like sweaty sore thumbs on skates in the middle of a well dressed yuppy theater district and I loved it!  We thanked the waiter and I tried to tip him but he said "don't do that; just come back later and eat."

<p>Across the street we went to gaze upon Buffalo Bayou, which was a tad overflowed (4 feet lower than what Jason and I had seen 2 days after it had been 25 feet overflowed) and I decribed to Diane how deep it had been.

<p>Amanda called at that moment on my cell phone and we made plans to meet back at Biba's (how ironic that I went twice in 1 day after not going there for over a year).  Diane and I slowly made our way back toward her car, which was about 12 blocks away at this point.

<p>Got to Biba's and magic happened when Diane and Manda met. Not like romance magic, but they connected on a professional level: Diane is a real estate agent looking to expand her business, and Amanda has had interest in getting her real estate license, but didn't really know how and <b>bing</b> it was amazing!

<p>They talktalktalktalked and I just ate my Greek Pizza and cleaned up the phone number list stored in my cell phone, keeping an ear toward the conversation.

<p>At one point, I pointed out that within 1 week of when Diane and I first met, I went to a palm reading party that she hosted which forever changed my life in a wonderfully positive way. I greatly hope the same type of impact happens for Diane and Amanda.

<p>Manda and I went home around 1:30am then slept in on this lazy Saturday.
