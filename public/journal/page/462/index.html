<p>Jack and I were chillin' in the front room and someone walked up to
the door.  I was all, "come in!" before they even knocked.  Then I
realized it was Chez!  "Is that Chez??!"  Wow!  Chez is missing her
Behavioral Modification class at DCC right now; haha that's pretty
ironic I think.  Jack told us about the semester he didn't buy any
books for his college classes, and I told them about the song "Free
Guitar Lessons For Animals" by Flossie and the Unicorns.  It fit into
the conversation, really.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>Went to a nice restaurant with Wende, and then to the
restroom to wash my hands, and Robin and Chris from my I-group were
there each taking a piss.  I was at the sink and could hear their
voices, and then when they came out I was like, "HI" and told them I'd
be out in a second.</p>

<p class=dream>Robin came back in and said he had to go somewhere real
quick, and then I was out in the restaurant and one of the waitresses
asked me if I worked there.  I was all, "no" and she was all, "darn,"
because there weren't enough cute guys on the waitstaff near her age.
Hmmm; very interesting.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class=dream>At a school, a college campus, and attended a religious
meeting of some sort, and I chose to go to the freshman area, even
though I was a junior, for this was my first year in the school to
attend this meeting.  The students in different sections were sitting
in perfect rectangular shapes, instead of in circles.  There had been
no indication of how to arrange ourselves; it just seemed to happen
that way.</p>

<p class=dream>The girl to my left was a veteran of thsis group; she
was sitting patiently, and looked like Jack's friend Natalie.  The
girl to my right was a first timer like myself, and she looked like
maybe Mimi from Youth Council and Steering Committee some years
ago.</p>

<p class=dream>The church leader guy came out and told us what pages
to read of their holy book, and we were expected to repeat four times
what he said.  Most of the group cooperated, but a few people (like
me) wouldn't say anything, and a few (like Mimi) complained they
wouldn't do it at all for they were being treated like children.
Natalie was all, "give it a chance" or something.</p>

<p class=dream>The guy in the center threw a piece of ice at Mimi, but
missed her by a mile (several feet).  He said something like, "oh I
can't throw very well" but then proceeded to throw a piece of ice at
the ice machine and exactly hit its power button and turn it on.  Then
he threw another piece and exactly turned it off.  The piece used to
turn the machine off bounced toward me, so I picked it up and took a
bite of ice.</p>

<p class=dream>Natalie and I were both sitting, leaning back on our
hands and our fingers touched.  We flirted a bit, but then I was all,
"I can't right now," and disengaged my hand from hers.  She said
something about her innocence that was more like saying how she was
flirting without breaking any rules.  Hmm.  So I let her hand touch
mine again.</p>

<p class=dream>The leader guy came back into the circle, but this time
in a huge cadillac twice as wide and twice as long as a normal car,
but still normal height, and it was a hardtop convertible with the top off.
Many people were in the car and everyone started getting out and I
flew away from the crowd because I felt threatened by something.  I
was flying at super high speed through trees like in Star Wars in
Empire or Jedi (I forget) on the planet Endor.</p>

<p class=dream>The bad guys were unable to chase me so quickly through
the trees, and I was just flying so fast, often times twirling and not
looking where I was going, but still going crazy fast without hitting
anything.</p>

<p class=dream>I was able to fly low near the ground and up a slight
incline (unusual for me), and able to fly way way high within the
branches of trees.  Huge pine trees and redwoods.</p>

<p class=dream>I found in a deep canyon in the forest, some sort of
fort the bad guys had built, and I had a sheet of paper in my pocket
that depicted a map of the fort area, and I had to rotate it a few
times to get it to line up correctly, but mostly I just realized I was
having a dream and that I would make it line up corectly, even if the
origianl map didn't have to do with this fort below me.</p>

<p class=dream>I looked for a weakness and figured out that I needed
to knock down a log on one corner of the fort and that would set off a
chain reaction to destroy it, but I knew I possibly wouldn't be able
to get fly back up again after flying that far down (sometimes I have
trouble flying up in my dreams if I'm stopped, especially if I'm down
low) so I flew back out of the forest where bad guys and good guys
were fighting in cars on the road and I found a friend and tried to
figure out a way to get her the note without me stopping flying, and
without chance of the bad guys getting it.</p>

<p>Then the phone rang and I woke up.</p>

<p>I've been doing better with Dvorak keyboard layout.  My technique
has not been to go cold turkey (whatever the hell that means) but to
allow myself to switch back anytime I get too frustrated.  Then I
switch back to Dvorak when I feel like I have plenty of time, like
now.</p>

<p>Fun stuff yesterday and today:</p>

<p><li><p>pic of Phat Pat&rsquo;s pink hair and his seizure coupon, an animated
.gif</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>seeing the remnants of an AIM conversation on the computer that
ended with &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call you&rdquo; and &ldquo;okay&rdquo; and Jack on the phone with
someone.  I added to the conversation, &ldquo;Tell Jack that I&rsquo;m logging him
off.&rdquo;  and then subsequently chatting with this person while Jack was
on the phone with her.  It turned out to be his friend Aisha, who is
apparently a really cool cat.</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>Listening to Eminem really loudly in the car with windows
rolled down and then Janette noticing how loud it was and turned it
down.</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>After a serious conversation about politics, Janette, Jack, Rob
laughing about Greater Tuna and Marfa Texas.</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>Jack not knowing that the can opener had been working
correctly.</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>Josephine calling from Rick&rsquo;s to have her mom pick her up, then
I kept her on the line while Jack called from her phone here without
her knowing.  &ldquo;Um, there&rsquo;s a call on the other line, so I&rsquo;ll let you
go.&rdquo;  &ldquo;No, no, I&rsquo;ll hold.&rdquo;  We kept her on the phone until her mom
arrived, and then asked to talk to her mom.  Told her mom, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got
some girls coming over, so we gotta let you go.&rdquo;  Jack adds, &ldquo;a blonde
and a brunette.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Oh yeah, we definitely gotta let you go.&rdquo;</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>Going to the Sixth Floor Museum, the exhibit about JFK&rsquo;s
assassination, including the window in which Hinkley sat and all that
shit.  A big wall presenting why it couldn&rsquo;t have been a government
coverup, and how one single bullet could have traversed so many
different directions and stayed perfectly pristine.  Yeah right.</p></p>

<p><p>The better exhibit was one floor above, with a bunch of Pulitzer
Prizing winning photographs, each including a little story about how
the picture was taken: maybe the film had to be smuggled out of a war
torn area, or the photographer had to wait for 34 hours to get the
shot, or had to abandon human instinct/emotion to run or collapse in a
torrent of emotions.</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>Helping Joey with her calculus homework, graphing the distance
traveled by a family going to a scenic weekend location.</p></li></p>

<p>Arrived last night here at the Bibby's.  Drove from Denton to here
while talking with Dude up in Eugene Oregon.  He's got a personalized
home phone number again.</p>

<p>Josephine watched Muppet Christmas while Jack computered.  He got a
new email address at <a href="https://www.gohip.com">gohip.com</a>.
When Janette was all, "Jojo, you have school tomorrow," Joey was all,
"<em>I</em> don't have to go to school, <em>you</em> have to go to
school!"  So funny!</p>

<p>It rained a lot last night/this morning, so I'm going to help
Janette pull weeds out of her garden since the ground is soft.</p>

<p class=date>12:34pm</p>

<p>Jack and I have just helped Janette move a vanload of her antiques
from an antique store to Sean's old room.  Heaviest thing was a
concrete birdbath.  Largest things were two ladders.  Most surprising
thing to me is a wooden Victorian architecture thing called
gingerbread, which was probably made in the late 1800s.  Cool
stuff.</p>

<p>Jack is checking his email now as he might join Rick at Senator
Graham's office to protest the proposed war in Iraq.</p>

<p class=date>6:21pm</p>

<p>We made two more trips, and turns out that the anti-war meeting is
tomorrow not today.  I took a phat nap afterward, and have been
reading <em>Culture Shock Japan!</em> for the past hour plus.</p>

<p>I feel kinda dumb for having waited until the last minute, but I
haven't found out Bryn's flight information to London.   I left a
message on her mom's home phone, and Bryn's cell phone yesterday and
this morning.  Now I'm at Kinko's in Denton trying to use the breadth
of the internet to find her.</p>

<p>Weird how a few years ago I would not have assumed I'd be able to
find anyone on such short notice.  Now, it's almost possible, and in a
few years it will certainly be expected.</p>

<p>If you happen to have details on her flight, feel free to <a
href="mailto:bryn_finder@robnugen.com">let me know!</a></p>

<p class=date>9:49am</p>

<p>I feel like the kid in my long joke chasing the guy in the black
hat white gloves and red cape.  He's just one step behind.  I learned
from Steve that Bryn was in San An (of course!!!) so I have just
called Art Severance who said that Bryn, Elizabeth, Katie, Bryan all
left his house around 7:30 in the morning to go to DFW airport.  I'm
considering driving there to find them, but I'm wary of releasing my
internet connectivity...  Hmmm.  I'll risk it.</p>

<p class=date>11:44am</p>

<p>Took me a while to park; I didn't know there were plenty of spaces
available at the top of the garage.  I've explored Terminal B, talked
to British Airways guy and learned that Bryn has no reservation on
their flight.  However, she does have a reservation for an American
flight.  Took a train from terminal B to terminal A.  I now know what
gate, what time, and that she has not checked in.  But I still don't
know where is Bryn.</p>

<p>Five hours until her flight time.  Therefore 3 hours until she is
supposed to be here.</p>

<p class=date>12:33pm</p>

<p>Now I know that she <em>has</em> checked in.  I just paged her or
Bryan, but I haven't seen them yet.</p>

<p class=date>1:47pm</p>

<p>There's a ridiculously loud screeaching droning squealing staticky
squealing loud din stinging from the overhead loudspeakers.  About 1
out of 10 people is covering their ears from the noise.  It sounds
like the finest Japanese Noise that would make any KTRU DJ proud.
It's been wailing for over 15 minutes now.</p>

<p>No sign of Bryn.</p>

<p class=date>2:02pm</p>

<p>Aw fuck.  I can't believe I stupid I was to assume that Bryan,
Katie, Elizabeth all would not have tickets.  Of course they must.
They're all still in school.  K and E up in Minnesota, and Bryan maybe
still up in Vermont or something.  I've been assuming they would be
equally stuck on the non-passenger side of the security gate.
Damn.</p>

<p>I have just asked the operator to page Bryn (the squealing stopped
a few minutes after I wrote last, maybe 18 or 20 minutes total KTRU
music) to call the phone in front of which I am standing now.  But the
paging system has been silent for a long time; no way for me to tell
right now if Bryn can even hear the paging system now.</p>

<p>Pooh.</p>

<p class=date>2:20pm</p>

<p>The woman who told me that she had checked in saw me still waiting.
She offered to look for Bryn at the gate.  Wow!  I waited a couple
minutes and soon saw her walking the opposite direction from which she
first started.  Couple minutes past that she walked back with Bryn
right behind.  I walked up toward Bryn while facing the woman to say
"you are the best!" as I hugged Bryn.  So thankful and so great to
hang out with Bryn for several minutes.</p>

<p>She seemed surprised and confused about why I would show up.  I
reminded her that at SWUUSI I had told her that I wanted to say Bye to
her at the airport.  Bryn said, "it's only going to be for four
months!"</p>

<p>Bryn was also quite tired, after staying up late playing Silent
Football.  She was dictator for the game. <! "I was dictator so
everyone was quite drunk." > </p>

<p>She had gone to New Orleans with a friend of hers, but they got
bored and decided to drive to San Antonio.  They had met a girl named
Zoe who also needed to go to San Antonio so they offered to give her a
ride.  Zoe got to chill with them for a couple days at the Severances.
How fun!</p>

<p>Melissa (Bryn's sister) and their mom are already in London.  At
one point Melissa asked Bryn, "so, when is mom going to get here?"
Bryn had been all, "um, [didn't you know] she's already there?"
Hahaha that's funny.</p>

<p>Bryn made her financial goal working before London, and bought a
new computer.  Excellent work.</p>

<p>Graham (Bryn's friend from OZ who got us sleeping space in the
house in Actontown) is going back to OZ soon.  Don't know when
exactly.  Bryn has a week or so before school, so hopefully he'll be
there that long at least.</p>

<p>I told her some of my adventures, told her about Bronwyn calling
me, but us not getting to hang out in Helena.  Told her where I had
been staying and that I would get to work for Janette again this week
(probably tomorrow)</p>

<p>Hugs to Bryn as she went back through the security gate with an
hour to spare (she wanted also to get some food before going) and then
I super-thanked the woman at the reservations counter who had gone
back to the gate to find Bryn.  I still don't really know how/if she
easily identified Bryn.</p>

<p>Rode the terminal train back to Terminal B, walked across two
airport roads and a parking lot to get to the garage where I parked.
Five dollars to the parking guy and drove back to Denton.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>In a big mansion type place, I was asked if I knew how
to select a bunch of bananas at their peak of ripeness, and some huge
trees had banana bunches way up in their branches, so I climbed up
onto this large boat with a canvas roof and startled a turtle, who
slid of his perch and took a bit of a tumble down a hill and ened up
on his back but flipped himself over so I didn't bother him any
further.  I slowly made my way up this boat and found that I could
have just used the stairs that led up to a balcony that ran just
underneath the branch with the bananas.  On this large balcony were
several nicely dressed individuals with drinks like a dinner party as
I was carrying a bunch of bananas downstairs.</p>

<p class=dream>Discovered a large swimming pool with large snakes in
and around it.  Not so many snakes that people wouldn't swim, which
they did, but they just had to be careful of snakes coming up to
occasionally bite or strangle them.  A couple of snake charmer type
people were trying to make cash by impressing folk with their snake
interaction skillz, or just by carrying huge snakes around on their
necks like scaley scarves.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class=dream>With Kristen's sister Jessica at a place where two guys
each with scads of cash crumpled up in various rooms asked her if she
would teach a group of their friends how to write well.  Jessica asked
about what they would pay her, and they just gave her some cash out of
their pockets and it was like 10 dollars, and then one guy went off to
his room and brought back a pile that was a bit more substantial, and
just as Jessica was done straightening and facing the bills, the next
guy dumped more on her lap, effectively forcing her to start over with
the counting as she wouldn't be able to tell what she had counted and
what she hadn't.</p>

<p class=dream>As Jessica and I were riding the bus back home, she
counted like $160, which was plenty of money for her to want to teach
the class, but she didn't have a sense of how to begin such a project.
I old her that I would be able to help, if I had time, and her sister
might be able to help as well if she had the time.</p>

<p class=dream>We got off the bus at a crowded university campus and a
woman gave me ten dollars for no apparent reason.  Jessica and I were
all "whoah that was weird," and parted ways as I needed to cross the
street and she needed to go up the street.  We didn't hug, but were
just like, "bye" even though we didn't know when we would see each
other again.</p>

<p class=dream>I walked across the street despite traffic and a
bicyclist slowed down and swerved out of my way, when he could have
just stayed the same speed and straight and been past me before I got
there. I heard him complain a bit as he rode by, but I didn't sweat it
as I made it across the street.</p>

<p>I'm in Denton now.  After YRUU, I followed Marta to her parents
house where she dropped off her mom's car, and then I drove her home.
Turns out that Denton is closer to DFW than Dallas, so I'm going to
stay here and hopefully track down Bryn's exact leaving arrangements
so I can see her off to UK.</p>

<p>Marta and I just watched Dogma.  Ironically we both watched it this
past week, possibly both on the same night.  Very interesting.</p>

<p>Now I remember my favorite lines from the movie: "You know Jesus?"
<br>"Know him?  Shit, nigga owes me twelve bucks!"</p>

<p>In Plano YRUU, Jon had out a little hand held video game thing and
I asked him if he was able to save his place in the game.  At that
moment I wasn't asking him to turn it off so we could have check-in
(though that could have been a viable reason), but wondering more
about the state of technology, cause "back in my day we had games like
Split Second and Simon, and we couldn't save anything."</p>

<p>Simon was all, "haha you had a game named Simon."</p>

<p>Jackie said, "there should be a game called Jackie."</p>

<p>So we made one up:</p>

<p>Jackie's Purdy Game</p>

<p>5 to 15 players</p>

<p>Three people are selected to be named Jackie 1, Jackie 2, Jackie 3.
They all leave the room and one of the Jackies briefly tells the
others a story about themselves that no one has heard.  They come back
into the room and each one gives a summary of the story.  Then the
rest of the group asks probing questions about the story to specific
Jackies.</p>

<p>eg: "Jackie 2, what type of beverages were there?" or "Jackie 3,
what color was the mouse?"  That kind of thing.</p>

<p>After a few minutes of questioning, the group comes to consensus of
who they think the real Jackie is.</p>

<p class=date>12:08am</p>

<p>Come to find out, this game is one that used to be a TV game show
from 30 years ago.  I thought Marta made it up, but no.</p>
