<p>"Worst episode <em>ever</em>."
<br>-Comic Book Guy</p>

<p>I'm pretty tired, but I will describe in not
entirely the wrong order the wack things that happened
at KTRU today:</p>

<p><ol>
<li>A guy kept calling and asked me to read off the
song titles on different albums so he could decide
which one he wanted to hear and record it.</li>
<li>I played a song for him not realizing it was
marked "NO" and it had (at least) the word "fuck" in
it.</li>
<li>The computer was SO SLOW that I could hardly type
on it.</li>
<li>The computer caps lock and tab keys messed up so
it would only tab backwards</li>
<li>The [save] button on the computer quit working so
I had to reboot</li>
<li>After rebooting, the computer wouldn't indicate I
had typed anything.  (I was typing on the keyboard and
nothing was being written on the screen)</li>
<li>Finally got it to log in and still had a load of
calls while getting caught up on entering everything I
had played.</li>
<li>Got crunched for time at the end and had to cram
like 8 playlist and 4 alternative tracks into 1
hour.</li>
<li>The front of the mic fell into my lap as I
prepared to speak on air the very last time.</li>
<li>Cute Erin had a sub today so I didn't get to see
her(*)</li>
</ol></p>

<p>(*) this was actually cool because Danny who subbed
for Erin knew how to fix the computer.  (Reboot the
server (yes Windows sucks shit))</p>

<p>I'm at HACYAC (Houston Area Cluster Youth Adult Committee (?))
meeting now; we are brainstorming and planning some social action
events to do.</p>

<p class=date>1:45 am</p>

<br>Ryan McCarthy (write-in vote in mysterious blue marker) but Pat
won.</p>

<p>Who is everything your mother warned you about?
<br>Phat Pat</p>

<p>This person's life is just like a soap opera.
<br>Heidi</p>

<p>If the secret to long and healthy life is an active sex life, who
would live to be 100?
<br>Matt and Heidi</p>

<p>Who talks the most about sex?
<br>Phat Pat</p>

<p>If streaking were a fad again, who would be the first??
<br>Pat and Allison</p>

<p>If we could be kids again, who would be the first to suggest
playing Doctor?
<br>Matt</p>

<p>Who would be your sexy dream date?
<br>Gram</p>

<p>Who here has the most mysterious personality?
<br>John</p>

<p>If people were desserts, who would be angel food cake?
<br>Gram and Meg Cusack</p>

<p>Who do you think has saved every love letter ever received?
<br>Heidi</p>

<p>Who would be the first to take part in the sexual revolution of the
1960's?
<br>Matt</p>

<p>Who would you be for 24 hours?
<br>Rob!  (yay!  I finally won one!)</p>

<p>Thanks to the brilliance of Kate R, we are writing our own
questions!</p>

<br>Matt and Pat</p>

<p>Who would be the first female president of the US?

be?

<p>Who is most likely to fall asleep?
<br>LSN</p>

<p>Who likes pickles with everything?
<br>Meagyn and Matt</p>

<p>Who is your second persona?
<br>LSN</p>

<p>Who is so so adorable?
<br>Gram</p>

<p>Whose birthday is it?
<br>LSN (landslide, because it is!)</p>

<p>Who would be passed out on the floor?

<p>Exactly 1 week and 1 year until Wende and I are married!!  So
strange to think that, and to have had such a long engagement.  I
trust that we will be ready and all kinds of good stuff by then.</p>

<p>- - - - - -</p>

<p>Our class instructor keeps using the word 'monkey' as a verb, as in
'you can monkey with the program ...' blah blah, and I keep thinking
of my wonderfully funny friend Alexis from KTRU who is (was) a
linguistics major, and said her favorite word sounds were those that
have the n-k-y sound, like 'monkey' and 'linky'.  Sometimes she would
just say 'monkey monkey monkey, I just love that word!'</p>

<p class=date>1:01 pm</p>

<p>After lunch, Rob and I tossed his frisbee around in the lovely sun.
I got pretty hot, and he was wearing pants and shoes; he's probably
more hot.  Regina is all, 'it's cold in here!'  'No it's not,' Robs
say.</p>

<p>How fucking cool!!!  Wow wow wow.  I just called KVRX, 91.7fm in
Austin and (they can take calls on the air!) talked to the DJ a bit
about supporting KVRX because "this is not quite exactly true, but
<em>all</em> the other radio stations are ultimately owned by about 5
cats who dictate all the music, which is why every radio station
across the whole US sounds exactly the same!!"</p>

<p>He asked what I was doing in Austin, and I told him I was learning
SAS, a wacky language that psychology grad students would know, etc,
and it was cool to just hang out with him briefly on the air.</p>

<p>"Support 91.7 in Houston <em>and</em> in Austin cause it's so
important that these stations stay on the air.  Turn your radio up and
tell all your friends!"</p>

<p>And then the even funnier thing was the next caller was all, "Yes,
I would like to buy your radio station."</p>

<p>"Okay, who is this?"</p>

<p>"This is Rupert."</p>

<p>"Are you one of the 5 cats who own all the other radio
stations?"</p>

<p>"Of course not!  I could buy each of them ten times over.  I just
want to purchase your radio station.  I think you'll find my offer
quite generous."</p>

<p>They rambled for a bit, and it was pretty funny, especially when
"Rupert's" accent changed.</p>

<p>"Hey, your accent has changed."</p>

<p>"Yes, well, It's early in the morning."</p>

<p>"You started with an australian accent and have shifted to a
brooklyn accent."</p>

<p>"Let me know when I turn Mexican."</p>

<p>Very funny.  Hilariously funny!</p>

<p class=date>8:59 am</p>

<p>Woah.  In this made-up data there is a person named Debbie Barnes!
But this person is from North Carolina.</p>

<p class=date>11:57 am Thursday 14 June 2001</p>

<p>Wow.  We are getting into much more intriguing code things now.
Nice.</p>

<p>Lunchtime now.</p>

<p>Aunt Nancy and I just saw Swordfish starring the supa cool John
Travolta as a 'terrorist hating zealot' (Nancy) or a 'precise
heartless psycho' (Rob).  Pretty good movie, I thought; Nancy is
thumbs down: too predictable with unecessary violence ('and I don't
mind necessary violence') and gratuitous nudity, though Halle looked
good.</p>

<p>I say 'wow,' to whoever's gross mind wrote the hostage bombing
scene, and the flying was pretty unexpected.</p>

<p class=date>9:29 pm</p>

<p>The guys on KVRX's News Rant show are <em>funny</em>.  I'm enious
that they get to be all funny and take calls on the air!!!</p>

<p>Going swimming with Sally now.</p>

<p>Oh.  before seeing Swordfish, I noticed that I had left my shoes at
the training center, 15 miles away.  Luckily, they didn't care; I got
to watch a movie while barefoot!!  Yay Austin!!  My kinda town!.</p>

<p>We bought some of the Adidas sandals, which really I have wanted
for quite a while so that we could go eat at Chango's, which, by the
way, they joked about on The News Rant, and I called them and
hopefully was pretty funny on the air. </p>

<p class=date>2:34 am Friday 15 June 2001</p>

<p>Fell asleep listening to Beastie Boys <em>Root Down single</em>
after chillin' in the pool and hot tub.  going to Stacy's now.</p>

<p>Just finished lunch; they have a cafeteria here for the employees
of SAS, and we got our own table with our own waitstaff (1 person,
apparently the chef) and I correctly identified the ingredients of a
shredded fruit medly: carrots, jicama, apple, ginger, plus a cherry
tomato and slice of avacado.  Most people didn't like this, but I
enjoyed it.  A bit too much ginger though.</p>

<p>Class has been pretty straightforward yet positively reinforcing of
stuff that would have taken me longer to figure out alone.</p>

<p class=date>1:09 pm</p>

<p>Heh.  I just added a where clause to the dataset.  Nice.</p>

<p class=date>1:33 pm</p>

<p>We are zipping through the class and we might even get most of
Friday off!</p>

<p>He said he won't tell our bosses, and that we won't get any money
back.</p>

<p class=date>2:06 pm </p>

<p>Afternoon break now; I called in to work because Dave had a
question.  His question proved that he doesn't know how the G3 works.
This means that we need more training on G3, and that Dave doesn't pay
attention when I tell him how it works.  Grr.</p>

<p class=date>4:02 pm</p>

<p>I've come across a weird thing on my computer, and the instructor
is helping me solve it, but secretly I just want to go home.</p>

<p class=date>5:30  pm</p>

<p>I left and went to Wende's aunt Nancy's work/business and hung out
for a bit and then went to Stacy and Rodd's.  Dinner now.</p>

<p class=date>10:00 pm</p>

<p>Got <em>Totally</em> ridiculously lost on the way to Sally's to go
out to downtown tonight.  Meeting her friend Valerie who has never
been to Antone's.  I'm about an hour late getting here I got so lost.
Took a tour including 2244, lost creek blvd, barton springs, 2244
again, 360, Mopac, Wm Cannan (sp), I 35, 15th st, Lamar, Brazos,
Lavaca, and finally here.</p>

<p>When I was at Wm Cannon and 35, I called the girl at KVRX and asked
which way to go on 35 to get to downtown.</p>

<p>'North.'</p>

<p>'You are the best!  Thank you so much.'</p>

<p>I was pretty much way farther south than I had guessed.  Wow.</p>

<p>Yikes it's late.  And it will be even later before I leave Sally's;
my clothes are being washed cause they were all stinky with smoke from
the club and I didn't want to put them near my other clothes or even
in my bag at all, plus they were my only clean clothes.</p>

<p>I'm supposed to be at the training center in 7 hours.  No worries,
mate.</p>

<p>We went to Antone's as La Tribu played everyone's favorite merengue
y salsa hits.  They even had a salsa training lesson.  Sally was quite
supportive and said I was doing really well, but man it sure felt
weird and not like I was doing very well at all.  I'm a lot more
comfortable with Rob's Crazy Dance to the droning or breaking beats of
a rave or jungle party.</p>

<p>Not that I've been to too many of those.</p>

<p class=date>1:47 am</p>

<p>sleep.</p>

<p class=date>3:51 am</p>

<p>Awake.  Sally was a fabulous hostess, on the same calibre as
Maggie.  I'm going to Stacy and Rodd's house now.</p>

<p class=date>4:40 am</p>

<p>On the way home I talked to Alexis, a DJ at KVRX.  Asked her to
play one of my favorite KTRU songs by S.O.L.O.  She'll look for it.  I
really really like KVRX!</p>

<p>Moment of truth:....???  S.O.L.O.  song 'fish Happens' on KVRX?
False.  Oh well.  I just requested it.  Alexis is the DJ; she may
check out my show on Saturday night; that would be cool to get a call
from her!</p>

<p>If so, I will definitely play Fish Happens.  I have just made it to
Stacy and Rodd's..  I didn't get lost.  Oh, I left my dome light on
inside Scott while hanging out with Sally.  Oh well.  Scott started no
worries.  He was on a hill anyway, so I could have done a
clutch-popping start.</p>

<p>I haven't worked yet today, but I've been at work
since 9am or so.  I answered a few work related emails
(I guess that counts) and then started searching
online for images of the flood.  Not closeups of
people being saved, but ones that show how high the
water was in places that are designed for people, not
fish.</p>

<p>I found on Lycos some news reports unrelated to the
flood, but about computer security - something called
TEMPEST, which is the code name for the, um.. research
being done on how to read electronic emissions from a
distance.  Like how to carefully analyze the
electromagnetic signals being generated by a monitor
to determine what it is displaying.  Even through
walls and shit.</p>

<p>And one of the pages said, "did you mean to look
for Tempest, the Atari video game?" and gave a link to
Tempest, the Atart video game.  I read an interview by
the creator, and learned that Tempest is the most
highly collected arcade game ever.  Wow.  How ironic
that while we were in San Antonio in 1985 or so, I saw
a Tempest game for sale for $400.  I REALLY REALLY
wanted the game, but my dad said no.</p>

<p>Actually I think he said, maybe, or we can look for
one in Houston.</p>

<p>I don't know that I would still want it, but I
might enjoy a game sometime.</p>

<p>But the point of this entry is to say I'm about to
post the OKC Silent Football game entries on my site,
as typed by Ben and Lauren.</p>

<p>Click the "previous" link a couple of times to get
to it.</p>

<p>I'm on my way to Austin, stopped in Giddings at the gas station
with the nice restaurant-caliber restrooms.  I like supporting them.
However, the woman was all, "do you have your shoes?"  as I walked
in.</p>

<p>"No, do you have them?"</p>

<p>"You need to wear shoes to walk around in here."</p>

<p>"Do you want me to pay?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you're going to pay."</p>

<p>"Well, here I come."  and I walked around the aisle to get to the
register.  </p>

<p>"Oh, you're going to be difficult about this.."</p>

<p>And she proceeded to tell me that it's important to wear shoes
because I could get a disease or something, but the funniest thing she
said was that "things aren't like they used to be."  Now, she wasn't
too old.  Maybe like 35.  How did things used to be?  How are things
now?  don't you think I've thought about all this?</p>

<p>I paid, and mostly politely listened to her blah blah blah, but I
certainly didn't buy any snack.  I guess I'll support their store next
time I come through if she doesn't fucking harass me about shoes.
Shoes in a gas station?  who has ever heard of such a thing?</p>

<p class=date>12:58 am Wednesday 13 June 2001</p>

<p>Got slightly lost on the way here, but now I'm at the place where I
had a reservation.  but there is no one here in the office, and 3
people (grandma and two youth about 10 and 13 years old) are sayiing
that they also had a reservation, but no one is here and they can't
even get anyone to answer the phone that the sign says to use if the
office is closed.  And, they assured me the rooms are a mess with
beetles in them.  Ew.</p>

<p>I'm going across the way to Comfort Suites.</p>

<p class=date>1:25 am</p>

<p>Visited the Comfort Inn, about 150 yards away and found the
<em>last</em> single was available, though it was marked dirty.  I
checked the room and found it to be quite clean.  He said maybe they
were planniing to do some repair on it, but I could certainly stay
their tonight.  I have set the alarm for 7:30am.  Good night.</p>

My waistline is right above my hips, but that seems
like kinda personal question, there.

Oh!  *Waterline*!  At our house, water came to within
50 feet of the house.  And by 50 feet, I mean 50
vertical feet.  We were high and dry.  Water was 6
feet deeper over the intersection at Allen Parkway and
Montrose.

I'm pretty much really bummed that I didn't get to
experience it, and by experience, I mean see the
flood, not have my house soaked.

I'm trying to imagine what it must have been like.  I
can see the waterlines about a foot above the Richmond
ground level area.  The ground floor of our building
got about 3 inches of water in it.  I haven't looked
for pictures on the web yet, but I want to *see* the
water up to the 4 bridges that cross 59.

It seems slightly spooky to me that in 1998 we got to
the 100 year flood line, and in 2001, we beat the shit
out of that record by six feet.

I'm super glad that your family and house and home and
boat and lifevests are all okay.  I wonder if Zeke and
Zack will remember.  What are their names again?

Soon I will flood my journal with entries from the
weekend, which includes us almost being halted in
Conroe getting out of the city.

If you do need to water your lawn today, go downtown
where they are giving water away free.

     With Love and wit
