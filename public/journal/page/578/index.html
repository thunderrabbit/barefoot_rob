                        <p class=date>17 December 2000</p>

<p>We just saw <em>Dude, where's my car?</em>  The 10:30 showing was the
last of the day and at the end of church the youth group decided to go
there.</p>

<p>At 9:45pm Wende and I got home from TCS Gift Exchange party.  I was all,
ziiiiinnng to drive up to the theater.  It was 10:33 when I arrived, so I
went in and looked for the group.  Couldn't find them, so I talked my way
past the ticket taker guy and went in to the screening room.  couldn't find
the group so I sat in a solitary seat just in front of the front rail.
There were some rows of seats in front of me.</p>

<p>Movie was good and funny, and after the outtakes, I saw my group on the
Front Row.  All of them with sore necks I imagine from looking up at the
screen.</p>

<p class=date>12:35 am 18 December 2000</p>

<p>My water is hot.  So hot that I can't drink it.  "So hot that I put 3
cubes of ice in it and it melted," dictates Susie.  We are at IHOP and I
asked for hot water cause it's freezing outside.  The guy brought a glass, a
*glass* of HOT water and was all "whew. that's hot.  You might want to use a
napkin or something to touch it."</p>

<p>I was all, "That was very brave of you," and "that certainly wasn't my
intention for you to burn your hand."</p>

<p>I can't imagine how hot that must have been on his hand!!</p>

<p class=date>12:59 am</p>

<p>Now at IHOP Cassie, Meg, Susie, Katy are telling funny stories.</p>

<p>Meg writes:</p>

<p class=message>what up, rob? so i guess that's all i can say. i am starved
for inspiration lately; every bit i can conjure goes in to my webpage. hey,
my webpage! check it out, i'm fixing it up...if you pay attention and sweep
your cursor over the words, you'll find...*gasp* special hidden links!
hooray. learned that from my friend robert. not you. <a
href="https://www.envy.nu/nontoxic/intro.html">https://www.envy.nu/nontoxic/in
tro.html</a> in case you wanna take another look. it's different now,
there's more. frames, even. i guess writing an entry for your webpage that
is simply plugging my OWN webpage is pretty stupid...but hey i'm a geek
anyway, i try my best. i'm glad you wore shoes tonight, because it's cold. i
would have been very cold for you if you hadn't worn shoes. then there are
the times when i only wear one shoe. something i've done since i was little
bitty. also something most people don't know about me. i haven't figured out
how to integrate it into conversations casually yet. "oh by the way, i like
to chill in one shoe. just one. yes i've just always done that. wait, don't
run away! dammit." i really dig the musak they play in ihop. i don't know
what this song is called but i know all the words. i used to go to ihop so
much. that i memorized the menu. needless to say it was a shock that when i
came back after not being here for a long time and found....THEY RE-DESIGNED
THE MENUS! and added things! jinkies. it's so hard to keep track. also, they
added little numbers over all the booths. once...the guy that is our waiter
NOW, was my waiter before- the redhead guy- and he took my jelly. see, i
always get toast when i come here. and then after i finish the toast i eat
the jelly. just the jelly. with the end of my knife. so he walks by and i'm
finishing up my third thing of jelly and i turn my head to say something to
kate. and when i turn back-- no jelly. he took it. :( dammit why did he do
that?? anyway, i'm not too bitter. so there's this guy named stephen with
whom i have become enamored. and katy likes to make fun of me for it because
he's 21. the point is that he's just this amazing person. sigh. you should
meet him. he works at starbucks. and becos i have no life, i hang out there
all the time and all the starbucks guys are my friends. mike and aaron and
stephen and josh and melissa...etc, etc. there's just nothing else to do
here, really. nothing else that's safe, anyway. so this show on the 20th--
it's gonna be so awesome. i really wanna get in to the whole being a
promoter gig...either that or hethre and i are going to start a band : i
just need to learn to play guitar. joe's supposed to teach me, so we'll see.
anyhoo, this is getting way long. so i'll end it. you rock, rob, and this
keyboard is really fun to type on...see you around.

<p>Just arrived home after seeing <em>Dude, where's my car?</em> at
the Woodlands Mall with the youth group from Northwoods.  Big rushes
of adrenaline each time I nodded asleep for a second.  Scary and not
good leading by example..  I'm going to bed now.</p>

                        <p><title>Gift exchange at Stacy and Rodd&rsquo;s</title>
<p class=date>8:19am CST Sunday 17 December 2000</p></p>

<p>In the morning, we helped Stacy and Rodd get ready for the family
to arrive.  Mostly the girls got stuff ready, but I wrapped the three
parts of Gary's present, taking them out of the box because on first
(second and third and fourth) glance, it's difficult to tell what they
are.

<p>Rodd and I went to the mall (listened to Eminem on the way there
and Lil' Kim (Kym?) on the way back.  I was all <em>wow</em> at Lil'
Kim's lyrics. I had no idea.)  At the mall we got barbecue utensils
with temperature displays on it.</p>

<p>(I would just like to take this moment to congratulate Marcel's
brilliance in 1992 or so.  He invented the idea of the Temp-O-Spoon,
which was a spoon with a thermometer display in the handle.  We never
patented the idea nor even built a prototype.  Obviously a marketable
idea, Marcel.  Good job.)</p>

<p>Family arrived, beginning with Grandma and Grandpa, Susan, Ken
(parents of) Alex and Mimi.  Alex and Mimi spent a lot of time around
me, with Mimi crawling up one end of the couch, leaping to the
cushions in the middle of the couch, crawling off the other end of the
couch and around to do it all again over and over.  Very cute.</p>

<p>Alex wanted to see me ride the unicycle, so I was glad to do that
for him.  I had a few more firsts on the uni: I rode in circles inside
a relatively small gazebo thing (about 12 feet in diameter, so my
circles were necessarily smaller than that - like 6 or 8 feet in
diameter), rode along the edge of a curb about 13 feet, recovered from
a few errors that would previously have sent me off the uni, and found
that I can relatively easily just get on and ride without using a curb
to hold the wheel while I get on.</p>

<p>Alex ran beside me in the street and on the sidewalk (so did Mimi
when she saw me) to watch.</p>

<p>Brunch was lovely; I sat beside Wende and Grandma, across from
(aunt) Nancy.  Nancy's new b/f Brad sat across from Wende. Brad
described his cool pentathalon training (running, shooting, swimming,
horseback, fencing); he hopes to compete in the nationals in February
in San Antonio.</p>

<p>After brunch, more unicycling and I was all hot after that, plus I
got my khaki pants dirty, so I changed into shorts and Trix t-shirt
for the gift unwrapping.</p>

<p>Gary was quite flummoxed opening his gifts in the particular order
that I encouraged him to do so.  The family equally so.  When he got
to open Box Three, which said, "Cap Rack" on it, that solved the
mystery and got a polite clapping from the family.  Gary has a lot of
caps.</p>

<p>I received a cute Simpson's theme note that essentially said, "DOH!
Your gift has not yet arrived, man."  Ooooooooh I wonder what it is!
(I really do.)</p>

<p>Family began to disperse after wonderful cobbler and ice cream for
dessert.  I rode around on the uni some more and waved bye, etc, see
ya to people.</p>

<p>Wende and I were the last to leave; I napped while Rodd watched TV
while Stacy and Wende made sure that we paid equal amounts for
Christmas to the family.</p>

<p>Drive home was fun; Wende and I talked about finances for
Australia.  We have been blessed with $ from family that will
essentially cover the entire trip.  We worked out the budget so we
have a sense of what we can buy for people while we are down
under.</p>

<p>Arrived home safely around 11:30pm.</p>

<p class=date>6:38pm CST Friday 15 December 2000</p></p>

<p>Wende and I are leaving for Austin tonight.  I'll probably get in
trouble for typing this entry while she's ready to leave.  I'll hurry.</p>

<p>New computer today seems pretty fly, but I'm not impressed with
Netscape 6.0.  If a button is highlighted, I can press spacebar to
"click" it, but not so with N6.0  I have to hit return or use the
mouse.  That's stupid.  If the shit is highlighted, what else could
space bar mean?</p>

<p>I just today finished the generic project for quickly producing
surveys for our future clients.  It should be pretty fly and work well
for lots of surveys.  The actual survey part is not as generalized as
the Ritz project, but this one is designed to be a 360 survey, people
can ask for feedback from different individuals, whereas the Ritz
survey doesn't need to take into consideration who the feedback is
for; it's all feedback for the same thing.</p>

<p>Today we had our Secret Santa exchange at work.  I got Dennis a
night at the movies in the form of a Blockbuster certificate and
popcorn and drinks.  It was in a box that I marked CAUTION LIVE ANIMAL
and I cut slots in the side so the apparent animal could breathe.
Inside the box with the gift I included a "live cat in a burlap sack"
toy that screeches cat noises when shaken.  The irony is that toy was
already his.  Hahaha!</p>

<p>Wende just arrived and I'm done!</p>

<p class=dream>At my dad's house, we had all three of his cats and our
three cats, and two "exotic" animals as pests: a small little
ferret/kitten thing and a gross big (8 inches long) green grasshopper.
(Shudder!)  We chased the ferret/kitten out, but didn't know how to
get the grasshopper out.  I overcame my fear and put a cloth over it
and got pinched a bit, but got it outside.  I threw it out the door,
intending for it to be safe, just <em>outside</em>, and when I threw
it, it hit the back of a desk and I felt really bad that I had hurt
it.  But I slammed the door shut thinking there's nothing I can do for
it now anyway.</p>

<p>Today my new PIII 1GHz machine came in!  It's not
yet configured, but I'll probably get to use it
tomorrow!!</p>

<p>I'm at work late working on the generic project,
setting it up so it can handle a variable number of
questions.  While I was testing, my machine suddenly
quit responding as a web server.  I rebooted and it
still wasn't working.  Then I realized what had
happened:</p>

<p>Earlier today, I asked SAVVIS to change the name of
the IP address that this machine is using.  Now its
name is oddball instead of rabbit.  When I get my new
machine, it will be called rabbit.</p>

<p class=date>7:17pm CST Wednesday 13 December 2000</p></p>

<p>Grrrr.</p>

<p>I just got home from a productive day at work and discovered that I
had missed a massage appointment with Kathy Fey at 6:30.  AARrggh!!!</p>

<p>See, the sucky thing is I really have felt all stiff in my neck and
been thinking that I need to go see her sometime, but I thought I must
not have set an appointment because my Visor alarm didn't go off.</p>

<p>Turns out I stupidly didn't set the alarm on my Visor for this
appointment.  Grrrrr!</p>

<p>I called Kathy and told her that I would pay the full price of the
massage; that way I remain in integrity with her.  She offered that I
should just pay half.</p>

<p>When she asked about setting an appointment for next week, I
balked.  Finally I told her what was in my head: Wende and I have been
griping about money, and I've wasted some and will just have to
effectively spend 1.5 times the normal amount for 1 massage.</p>

<p>Fighting about money is so stupid.  Why do we do it?</p>

<p>I want to "talk to Wende about it," whatever that may help and tell
Kathy tomorrow what we determined.</p>

<p>Ironically, Kathy has an open house tomorrow and Wende has the day
off.  Maybe we'll go visit Kathy tomorrow then.</p>

<p class=date>7:25pm</p>

<p>I have just now called Wende and we will go to the open house tomorrow.</p>

<p>Last night Wende asked me to set the alarm so KTRH news would come
on this morning so we could hear if ice had blanketed any portions of
the city.  Pretty much the weather is not as severe as had been
anticipated, therefore Wende doesn't have to come in to work to cover
for the person who does the money.</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>I just unicycled from my work parking lot down 1
long block to the street with the bridge with the tube
through which I crawled this summer.  I fell a few
times on the way there, mostly when going up big bumps
in the sidewalk, as tree roots have lifted and broken
the sidewalk over the years.</p>

<p>Each place I fell (except for one), I moved the uni
back several feet and tried again until I made it past
the bump.  The one place where I didn't try this was a
huge bump about 10 inches tall.  That's almost half
the height of my wheel.</p>

<p>But!  The most amazing thing is that I unied back
all the way along the same sidewalk without falling,
<em>including</em> down that big 10 inch drop!  I was
super impressed that I made it down the drop on my
first try.  I just slowed down before it and then
[<b>shoop</b>], down the incline and continued on my
way.</p>

<p>I have unied at about this time in the afternoon
each day this week, and a couple days last week.  It's
the perfect break for me.</p>

<p class=date>12:45am CST Thursday 14 December 2000</p></p>

<p>I turned in my 67th reviewed CD to KTRU today.  It's for Ian
Pooley's album <em>Since then</em>.  Most of the tracks can be
described as "groovin' bassline with female vocals."  I pretty much
enjoyed the CD and gave it all good marks.</p>

<p>Two different CDs I swilled: a self titled album by Lynx, and
<em>Terminal E</em> by Buttercup.  They were just rock and blucky.</p>

<p>I grabbed 3 new CDs to review.  Muslimgauze, something else, and
something else.  We'll see if they are cool or not.</p>

<p>On the way toward my car, which I parked up close to the building
in faculty parking, I offered a guy a ride to the stadium.  He
accepted the short ride which kept him from making the long walk in
the cold.  His name is Carmen (sp).</p>

<p>At home, Wende and I ate a little snack and now I'm going to bed.</p>
