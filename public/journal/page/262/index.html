<p>OMG this is so amazing!!!</p>

<p>First, it&rsquo;s amazing that I can listen to KTRU at all on this fancy series of tubes called the internizz.   Second, Fred and I were listening to the Vinyl Frontier&rsquo;s Christmas show a couple nights ago; fun times.  but that&rsquo;s not why I&rsquo;m writing.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s amazing that MK Ultra show is still kickin&rsquo; it.  I enjoyed listening to the whole <a href="https://noise.rice.edu/ktru/sheet.nsf/15aa60c8727df106802568e90056b4d1/9b62ecd77c6ac6e386257ae300124f48?OpenDocument">3 hours played by Dijon</a>, so I called him near the end just to say HI and what&rsquo;s up from Tokyo, etc.  We chatted for a bit, mostly me asking what had changed and what has stayed the same at the station in all those years since I was there.</p>

<p>He ended his shift with a song by an artist from Tokyo, then he closed his show with something like, &ldquo;yeah that was <artist name> all the way from <strong>Japan</strong>,&rdquo; giving just a bit of emphasis to the final word so I knew he was saying HI to me.</p>

<p>I called <em>back</em>, and the next DJ (TomZ) answered.  &ldquo;Dijon?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No he&rsquo;s in the other room; how can I help you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I just wanted to thank him for the shout out to Japan; I called him from Tokyo a second ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!  You&rsquo;re the Tokyo guy! hang on&rdquo;</p>

<p>I held; I said thanks to Dijon and got his IM address.   Moments later, via text message, Dijon assured me I should listen to the next DJ, TomZ.</p>

<p>3:01 PM dijon: sup rob, thanks for listening tonight. the dude who&rsquo;s on now is crazy&hellip; i&rsquo;d keep listening for a minute if you&rsquo;re able.</p>

<p> me: With that invitation, how can I resist?? ;-)</p>

<p>  Thank you for playing even while having a bit of a cough&hellip; keeping the music moving!</p>

<p>3:02 PM if you&rsquo;re still in the staiton[sic], tell him I&rsquo;m still listening. :-) yes, he sounds a bit crazy!</p>

<p>3:04 PM dijon: tom&rsquo;s chill. i gave him the message and he threw his hands in the air in an expression of pure joy</p>

<p>After that, things went a bit crazy.</p>

<p>TomZ came on the air between songs like, &ldquo;thanks for listening Thunder Rabbit! All the way from Tokyo.  By the way, I don&rsquo;t know if you remember, but I used to rollerblade with you back in the day, so anyway, thanks for listening&rdquo;</p>

<p>WHAT?????   Holy cats my brain was like WHAT??  How can he remember that?  How can I remember him??  I met so many people inline skating&hellip;   But Google has the memory of a massive computer brain so (while Tom was playing some noise music,) I looked it up, and found <a href="https://robnugen.com/cgi-bin/journal.pl?type=skate&amp;date=1995/01/20">a skate entry, at the very bottom of which is Tom&rsquo;s name.</a></p>

<p>While texting Tom that journal entry, plus &ldquo;my wife doesn&rsquo;t like this noise music haha,&rdquo; he was on air again, confirming my previous &ldquo;WHAT&rdquo; message with, &ldquo;yeah, back in the day, we met while skating, and I was like, wow that&rsquo;s cool.. and&hellip; life goes on,&rdquo; and while he was speaking, more brain cells started to wake up in my brain, &hellip; &ldquo;he sounds like that guy who ran for City Council!  What was his name???&rdquo; and I text <em>that</em> to him, and I was right!</p>

<p>He laughed, like, &ldquo;heh.  Yeah.  Back in 19__ I ran for City Council At Large position #4, and got 19,474 votes which was 18% of the vote that year&hellip; &ldquo;  etc, &ldquo;so maybe some memories are happening..  Oh, and hi wifey who doesn&rsquo;t like noise music!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing this since then so haven&rsquo;t written back, but I&rsquo;ll send him the link right &hellip; now.</p>

<p>PS: TomZ, Lin says HI!</p>

<p>Grumpy grouchy poopypants mood tonight and I don&rsquo;t know why.  I hate myself for taking it out on Lin, nitpicking how she did this or that differently than I would have.  For fuck&rsquo;s sake she does SO MUCH work around the house, how the fuck can I nitpick her for it?  It&rsquo;s fucking lunacy.  She cooks, washes dishes, even ensures the stove is spotless every night.  Not on my request, either; I&rsquo;m used to living a bachelor life with sink full of dishes, etc.  She makes my lunch each day (or more often the night before), thinking about what&rsquo;s good + delicious.  How can I complain?   grrrr stupid <del>me</del> <del>brain</del> <em>ego</em>.</p>

<p>At least I&rsquo;m able to communicate with her that I&rsquo;m feeling grumpy and she should all but ignore me, and not take it personally, if at all possible.  I know intellectually that this grumpiness is all my shit and she just happens to be a convenient target.  Gah.</p>

<p>We determined that (at the time of our chat), it was about T-minus 100 hours until we&rsquo;d get to hang out.  I&rsquo;ve got a stopwatch set; it&rsquo;s been running 3 hours and 8 minutes now.</p>

<p>I told him I was thinking of getting him some &ldquo;dope-ass chopsticks,&rdquo; or a &ldquo;ceramic katana&rdquo; so it would go through security as a carry-on.</p>

<p>Lin and I have been talking a lot about her plan to live/work in Thailand for a year.</p>

<p>Being apart for an extended time will be hard; I know!  I see it as an extension of our relationship into a new realm.  What&rsquo;s it like to be together and be apart for a decent bit of time?</p>

<p>Lin has &ldquo;always&rdquo; wanted to travel and see other parts of the world.  That&rsquo;s exactly how I came to Japan, and gave up a whole life with great friends and great Wende to do it.   Even when I found another great life with janette, I was like, &ldquo;yeah, no&rdquo; I can&rsquo;t settle here, all the way up in Dallas, when the original goal was <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> way around the world.   When janette dropped me off at the airport, it didn&rsquo;t hit me until I went through the gate.  Boom crying like a baby &ldquo;what the hell am I doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I got on the airplane having never been to Japan, hardly knowing the language (still don&rsquo;t, considering how long I&rsquo;ve been here.  Sorry, old Rob), and I remember how fucking hard it was to have no physical contact once I got here.  I got trolly comments on my journal when I was just wanting a hug.</p>

<p>So, I know it will be challenging, and I also know it will be growth.  For both of us, but especially for Lin.  She&rsquo;s wanted to travel for years but hasn&rsquo;t; she&rsquo;s been taking care of her family over taking care of her own dreams.   It will be growth for me and my desire for hugs.  Maybe I&rsquo;ll buy a (few) FREE HUGS t-shirt(s) to wear around town.   Maybe I&rsquo;ll spend more time in meditation to activate my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kundalini">kundalini</a>, instead of having all this energy in lower chakras.</p>

<p>I think of the whole experience as divine spiritual growth for each of us and both of us together.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ve mentioned, but the first time I washed Lin&rsquo;s back, I had a brief experience of déjà vu, &ldquo;wow; Lin and I have done this before!&rdquo; So I know we&rsquo;ve had at least one other incarnation together, and I suppose many many many incarnations together.  In this one, while we&rsquo;re deeply in love, we are planning to be physically apart for a bit.</p>

<p>My part includes maintaining my job and this apartment where Lin can come back anytime.  Her part includes releasing everything so she can live alone for the first time in her life.</p>

<p>I got up this morning thinking I should get some Thai flash cards for Lin, so I&rsquo;ll look for some now.</p>

<p><em>In a military built facility, there was a door designed for entry only, but from previous experience, we knew it would be more efficient to just go out the in door than to go around to the designated out door.  However, this time when we went out the in door, we were suddenly in a room 20 yards back from where we thought we&rsquo;d be. I was like, &ldquo;?&rdquo; and then went through the proper out door and we all got into the group again..  I asked others if they noticed anything weird while coming out of the facility.  Three of us agreed on the same experience.  I confronted one of the technicians there. &ldquo;Is there a teleporter in the facility?&rdquo; and she directly lied and said NO.  I was like, &ldquo;okay, has anyone else expressed the same thing that we did: they were unable to go out the in door because they were shifted backwards in the facility?   She said yes, because that question is one they hadn&rsquo;t been told they must lie about.</em></p>

<p><em>ah ha! we thought.  What a prefect way to test the technology for mass consumption to see if it can be safely used on people!</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still not quite great with the caretaking.  For example, when I came up to the table to just sit, they were like, &ldquo;do you want sushi?  do you want rice?  do you want cake?  which do you want?&rdquo; and I was like, &ldquo;no thanks&rdquo; and then boom a plate appeared and food that I didn&rsquo;t want was presented.</p>

<p>Um.</p>

<p>I noticed how spoiled the kids are. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s just <em>these</em> kids, but I&rsquo;ve heard rumors and anecdotal evidence that it&rsquo;s like this for many Japanese kids. Every whine, pout, request, was immediately pandered. Ugh.</p>

<p>We can&rsquo;t touch the 9 month old baby without washing hands first. Why? Don&rsquo;t we want to build up his immune system?</p>

<p>When the 2 year old was trying to pull Lin&rsquo;s iPad away from the 6 year old who had been playing with it, I saw them doing a little tug of war. I was like, &ldquo;false,&rdquo; and simply removed it from the realm of possibility.</p>

<p>Playing hide and seek with the kids was fun, reminding me of Fred and I playing hide and seek.  But I was bemused by how entertained they were with so few places to hide.  I mean, there were three places to hide:  (kneeling under the table, standing on the lee side of a shelf, and standing behind the door of the room).  Anywhere else would be immediately visible when someone entered the room.  I showed them a fourth place to hide, made by moving the very light couch a bit forward and lying down behind that.</p>

<p>I found an excellent hiding technique which I wasn&rsquo;t able to implement: climb over a counter and through the door to the next room (which was blocked by the counter).  I couldn&rsquo;t use it because the room into which I would vanish was adjacent to the waiting area used by people before trying to find the hiders.  Hmm.</p>

<p>I wore shoes today (for the first time since May *) because it was cold, and wet, <em>and</em> I have three (3) skin splits (as opposed to shin splints?) on my left foot. My right foot is fine.</p>

<p>(* except for the day I went to get my visa, and two days I went to meet my client for business meetings)</p>

<p><em>Went to Paola&rsquo;s home party with several other people there, baking cookies and yummy stuff.  I was helping Paola slice bread and put butter on it.  She was stabbing the loaf with the knife instead of slicing with the knife, and it seemed to get a bit dangerous so I stopped holding the loaf until she was done.  I pulled some first pieces off the loaf to put butter on them, and went to get the butter then came back and couldn&rsquo;t find the slices where I put them.  I realized they were under two to her slices that Paola must have stacked up on top of those.  I put them onto some foil to put them in the ofyen and Carla came in and was like, &ldquo;mmmmm&rdquo; and then I tolde her that&rsquo;s margarine, not butter and she was like, &ldquo;awwww&rdquo; and we were thinking about Carla&rsquo;s veganism and then I realized people were calling Paola &ldquo;Jane&rdquo; and as people in the other room were silent, Paola went in and said, &ldquo;you guys go ahead; I can&rsquo;t make it&rdquo; because there was too much work to do in the kitchen.  They were like, &ldquo;oh it&rsquo;s no problem,&rdquo; but some people thought it was an issue of Paola&rsquo;s perfectionism that made her not take on some large projects like building a tour through an abandoned village in a cloud forest through which we were now walking with Carla.  I climbed down the steps, testing out the rope to see if it would hold if people fell off the green mossy covered wooden stairs down which I was walking.  It held me just fine, and I turned the corner at the bottom of the stairs and found the guys were unfurling a long blue hose about 15 inches in diameter all the way down another staircase.  They inflated the hose with a fan at the top and we could slide down the hose without injury and with great speed.   The first guy tried it, but there wasn&rsquo;t enough pressure in the hose so his butt kept hitting the stairs.  I was like, &ldquo;more pressure&rdquo; and the guy turned on the fan a bit hired and then the guy on the stairs went whooosh down and hit his head on the top ridge of the tunnel near the bottom.  Oh crap, sorry, I thought cause he was too far away to hear.  The next guy went down with less incident, and then came back up using the air pressure as a rocket of sorts.  I saw the guy who hit his head and I apologized, but he said it was no problem.   I woke up before I got to slide down.</em></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to have Carla and Paola in the same dream so soon after I found out they both know Jana, whose name is similar to &ldquo;Jane&rdquo;</p>

<p>because Monday is a holiday, I figure my brain will need some notes to reload its current state.  Some notes on my desk point to a URL that will result in the notes here, spewed out by code in progress:</p>

<pre><code>in code above line 64, we need to fill in the default email 
from site_text factory (into array shown below)




Array
(
    [renter_id] =&gt; 23
    [to_name] =&gt; doug e fresh
    [to_email] =&gt; doug@e.fresh.net
    [subject] =&gt; These properties may be of interest
    [body] =&gt; data from site_text factory goes here
    [from_name] =&gt; Rob Nugen
    [from_email] =&gt; robnugen@company.co.jp
)




above is info from set 1
</code></pre>

<p>after save, display the email_set template or an error message. this will be the initial data entry for admin (but is now broken because template is trying to read data from DNE variables). we HAVE NOT sent the email yet</p>

<p>when admin enters data, need to figure out how to deal with new record (I think the sent_email class will create new record just fine)</p>

<p>now once data is POSTED by admin, we will be in section above marked with HAPPY NEW MAYAN CALENDAR</p>
