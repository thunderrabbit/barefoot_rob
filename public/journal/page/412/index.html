<p>I'm at Lockett Meadow now, a little parking area near the top of
the mountain, with four other cars here, counting the one that seems
to be leaving or lost.</p>

<p>I flipped a coin to decide whether to come here or go back to 84
and get back on my original planned path to Flagstaff.</p>

<p>I'm going to go walk around, and this time I'll bring my camera.</p>

<p class=date>12:47pm</p>

<p>Fun.</p>

<p>Climbed way up a hill, had to use my four paw drive to get up.
Sliding on gravel and snow...  Chilled at the top of a bluff, but not
the top of the mountain.  Called Wende to say what's up.  (answer: me!
at 7500 feet!)</p>

<p>On the way down I tried to slide on my back, but the snow was too
soft to really get any speed.  Plus lots of trees and logs in the
way.  But, for the record, I would have invented snow skates after
this adventure, had they not already been invented.  I see them as
about 18 inches long and about a foot wide, super slick bottom and
rounded like a snowboard.  One for each foot, for extreme sliding
excitement!</p>

<p class=date>1:34pm</p>

<p>Though I seem to have lost my hand drawn map, I drove right to the
parking lot of Kinko's in Flagstaff!</p>

<p class=date>1:40pm</p>

<p>heehee; found my map; it was in my backpack.</p>

<p>So I plugged in my computer at Kinko's, like I do at every Kinko's
and this cat comes up to me (after a couple minutes of connectivity,
enough time to upload all my entries before this one) and he's all,
"are you connected to our network?"</p>

<p>"yeah."</p>

<p>blabber blabber some bullshit about how I'm not allowed to connect
because if I bring a virus into the system it will corrupt all their
machines or something totally wiggidy wack like that and I'm all, WTF?
What a fucked up policy, EXPECIALLY considering the DHCP-enabled CAT 5
cable is on the desk of the cubical just like all other Kinko's I've
ever visited and he's telling me I can't use it???</p>

<p>I can't believe how pissed I am over this, and part of it is that
I'm pissed at myself for actually disconnecting even though I know
it's a fucked up policy made up by some non-computer-genius cat who's
scared of the internet.</p>

<p>Argh.</p>

<p>All I wanna do is send the five emails that I wrote and are waiting
in the inbox to go.  I'll do that and then roll out.  I can't engage
this guy in conversation; I'm too mad about it all.</p>

<p>Just turned over 5555 miles on this trip.</p>

<p>We're rolling toward Albuquerque now.  There's a great plume of
smoke ahead, which may just be water vapor from a power plant.  From
here it looks like a huge short broccoli with white stalk and dark
top.</p>

<p>Quite stange.  The top is definitely smoky or cloudy and the bottom
looks solid.  It's gotta be from a power plant.  Yes.  I'm sure that's
it.</p>

<p>5561 miles now.  250 or so to Albuquerque.  1 mile to Jackrabbit
Road.</p>

<p class=date>6:11pm</p>

<p>Woah.  I crossed over into New Mexico and didn't even notice until
now, 24 miles into the state.  I'm quite awake; I've been spitting
Eminem's "Rabbit Run" pretty effectively.  I still can't figure out
some of the words, and those i just skip so I won't learn them
rhongly, but the rest i can pretty much rap at the same speed as
he.</p>

<p>Let's see if I can type the lyrics that I know:</p>

<p class=note>(screen off to save power)</p>

<pre>
some days I just wanna up and call it quits
I feel like I'm surounded by a wall of bricks
every time I go to get up I just fall in pits
my life's like one great  big ball of shit
if I could just
put it all into all I spit
instead of always tryin' to swallow it
instead of starin' at this wall and shit
while I sit writer's block sick of al this shit
can't call it shit

all I know is I'm about to hit the wall
if I have to see another one of mom's alcoholic fits
this is it
last straw
that's all
that's it
I ain't dealin' with another fuckin' politic

I'm like a skillet bubblin'
till it filters up
I about to kill it 
I can feel it buildin' up
a probably spilled enough
I concealed enough
my cup runneth over
I done filled it up

?????  explode fill my guts
you think I only stand here and feel my nuts
I'm gonna show you what
you gonna feel my rush
if you don't feel it
it must be too real to touch
feel the dutch (?????)

(something I forgot)

goose pimples
yeah
I'm gonna make your hair stand up
??? stand up
I'm gonna show you who I be
I'ma make you hate me cause you ain't me

you wait
it ain't too late
to finally see
what you closed minded fucks
are too blind to see
whoever finds me is gonna get a finder's fee
out this world
ain't no one out their mind as me

need peace of mind?
here's a piece of mine
all I need's a line
but some times
I don't always find the words to rhyme
to express how I'm really feelin' 
at the time
yeah sometimes sometime sometimes
just sometimes
it's always me
how dark can these hallways be?
the clock strikes midnight
one two then half past three
this half assed rhyme
with this half ass piece of paper

I'm desperate at my desk, if I could just
get the rest
of this shit off my chest again
stuck in this slump 
can't think of nothin'
fuck I'm stuck
oh wait, here comes somethin'

nope 's'not good enough
scribble it out
new pad
crinkle it up
throw the shit out

I'm fizzilin now
thought I figured it out
the balls in my court
but I'm scared to dribble it out

I'm afraid,
but why am I afraid?
why am I a slave to this trade?

???? spit to the grave

[i forgot]

I can rip it any style you want

I'm a switch hitter bitch
Jimmy Smith ain't a quitter
I'ma sit here until I get enough in me to finally hit a
fuckin' boilin' point
put some oil in your joints
flip the coin bitch
come get destroyed

an MC's worst dream
I make them tense
they hate me
see me and shake like a chain link fence
by the looks of them
you would swear that Jaws was comin'
by the scresms of them
you would swear I'm sawin' someone
by the way they're runnin' 
you would think the law was comin'
it's now or never
and tonight it's all or nothin'

Mamma Jimmy keeps leavin' on us
he said he'd be back
he pinky promised
I don't think he honest

I'll be back baby
I just gotta beat this clock
fuck this clock
I'ma make them eat this watch
don't believe me watch
I'm gonna win this race
then I'll come back
and rub my shit in your face
bitch
I found my nitch
you gonna hear my voice
till you're sick of it
you ain't gonna have a choice
if I gotta scream till I have half a lung
if I have half a chance I'ma grab it
rabbit
run

<p>Well, I've driven almost an hour; I wonder how close I am to the
rest area.  I'm too tired to care; I'm parked in the parking lot of a
topless club that is deserted.  No tops, no customers, no nothing
except a bunch of 18 wheelers parked nearby to sleep.  I'm out of
their way I hope.</p>

<p>5868 miles since Dallas.  About 600 miles driven today.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>

<p>I'm in Arizona now. 5137 miles traveled.  Speed limit is now 75
instead of 70.  Oh the difference a state can make.  Scott and i still
prefer to go not much past 70 for long periods of time, unless we
happen to enjoy a gravity assist up to 80, as we did some miles ago.
Good stuff.</p>

<p>I bet myself a dollar that the state line was coming up soon, for
on the other side of the freeway (west bound traffic) there was
something that looked a lot like a toll plaza, except people were just
being waved through, just like I experienced while coming into
California on Interstate 8.</p>

<p>few minutes later when we crossed the Colorado River, I started
singing myself a song:</p>

<pre>
You owe me a dollar!
You owe me a dollar,
You owe me a dollar!
Pay it up now!
</pre>

<p class=date>7:36pm</p>

<p>Rest area now, about 18 miles into AZ.  5158 miles since Dallas.
I'm feeling pretty awake.  Yay chocolate and caffeine!</p>

<p>Oh, and I just now did kinda sorta well on maybe 1/2 of "Rabbit
Run."  I've got the first section memorized, and can usually keep up
with him on it.  Up through "My cup runneth over / I done filled it
up"</p>

<p class=date>7:49pm</p>

<p>On the road again.  A cat had posted two handwritten copies of
anote in the restroom, explaining that his car had broken down and
that he needed $61 to buy parts.  I was moved to give him a dollar "in
the white Plymouth Acclaim," but each time i saw him, I was unmoved to
do so.  Maybe it was cause he sat in the passenger's seat, eating
soething.  I duno; it just didn't feel right when I saw him.</p>

<p>What did feel right, however, was climbing in the rafters of the
roof over the brick structure covering th picnic tables.  It was
basically a plus sign of brick walls about 8 feet tall and then a roof
over them, and a table in each quadrant formed by the walls.  I stood
on a table, no wait, I put my foot on a table to stretch, and then I
saw the rafter and that I could easily reach them by standing on the
table.  Pulled myself up, climbed over the wall, and lowered myself
onto the table on the other side.</p>

<p>Good stuff.f</p>

<p class=date>8:50pm</p>

<p>five thousand feet and rising..</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t see an elevation sign at the peak, but it wasn&rsquo;t much higher
than the five 000 one.  maybe 5100 feet. Now down down down we go.</p>

<p>So.  I'm at an exit that claims the Grand Canyon is 60 miles north.
Flagstaff (my goal for the evening is 30 miles east.  I will flip a
coin three times to see which way I go.</p>

<p>Heads equals north, tails equals east.</p>

<p>In either case, I will drive to the goal, and not stop short.</p>

<p>All this coin flipping entertainment *after* I get gas.  Oh, and
there's <em>snow</em> on the ground around this Shell station!</p>

<p>Got gas.  No attendant at the station, so the restrooms were
locked.  However, Denny's next door restrooms were nice and clean.</p>

<p><em>Plus</em> there is a really attractive woman here behind the
counter.  She said HI nicely when I came in, and didn't seem to mind
that I was just using their facilities without buying anything.</p>

<p>So I'm back here at the counter to flirt with her and see if she
can help me answer my Grand Canyon Question.</p>

<p class=date>11:05pm</p>

<p>Hahaha.  Annie, the other waitstaff person is funny.  Some cat
finished a dish just as she was asking for it, and she goes, "Oh I
love you... my dad loves you... my mom loves you... ... even my dog
loves you.." not even really talking to him, but just saying it in a
funny laid back voice.</p>

<p>Cute waitress says the Grand Canyon at sunset is one of the most
beautiful sights.  She hasn't seen it at sunrise, but she theorizes it
would also be quite beautiful.</p>

<p>Her name is Liz.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Annie says that I should go see the Grand Canyon.  That it will
look great in the morning with snow sprinkled around.  Hmmm.</p>

<p class=date>11:43pm</p>

<p>So.  I'm outside Denny's in Scott, who's warming up.  I'm pretty
sold on going to see Grand Canyon.  I'm also a bit tired.  It will add
1+ hours each way (there and back here to get back to 40, for the
shortcut from Grand Canyon to Flagstaff is apparently quite dangerous
this time of year) and I'll need to watch for ice, deer, and elk.</p>

<p>I've decided to not flip coins.  I'm going to see the canyon.  But,
I won't hold myself to making it there tonight.  Just gotta get there
by sunrise.</p>

<p>5301 miles traveled since Dallas.  153802 miles on Scott.</p>

<p>Roll out.</p>

<p>Oh, the city I'm near is called Williams, elevation 6762 feet!!</p>

<p>I'm thankful for the opportunity to be helpful around the house for
Sally.  I'll put on her new bicycle seat, set up her new answering
machine, return <em>Amores Perros</em> to Blockbuster.</p>

<p class=date>12:06pm</p>

<p>At Kinko's now.  My challenge will be to not get caught up online
surfing all over the place, or goofing around a whole lot with my
site.</p>

<p>Aight.  I'm leaving Newport Beach again.  I have plans to go north
to 40 and then east east east.  I have located Kinko's near the
freeway in Flagstaff Arizona, and Albuquerque New Mexico.</p>

<p class=date>1:19pm</p>

<p>Okay.  Map shows I can go north on 55, east on 19, north on 15 and
get to 40 up in the mountains at 2170 feet in Barstow.  Oh cool; I'll
be just east of Edwards Air Force Base!</p>

<p>4848.7 miles since Dallas.</p>

<p class=date>2:34pm</p>

<p>Crazy mad trash traffic getting out of Hell A.  Even wayout on the
east side on 15 it's packed (and then patches of not packed) .
(ISally calls it bipolar traffic._)</p>

<p class=date>3:10pm</p>

<p>4910 miles.  Argh traffic.  bluh</p>

<p class=date>3:11pm</p>

<p>4914 miles.  Finally out of traffic.  Hopefully.</p>

<p>Weird thing is that the speedy parts of trtaffic were and are
uphill.  The slow parts were downhill.  I don't really have a model to
explain that.</p>

<p class=date>3:28pm</p>

<p>Just crested a summit at 4190 feet.  4927 miles traveled.  Stopped
to exchange fluids.</p>

<p class=date>4:44pm</p>

<p>I made it to I-40 and it's quite sparsely populated compared to the
traffic on 15.  In the back of a truck in front of me, I saw a woman
who I think was signiing to others in the truck.  I never confirmed
this and she never looked back at me for me to ask in sign if she
signs.   Ah well.  They turned off before 40.</p>

<p>In other news, I'm getting better at "Rabbit Run," which I've been
practicing pretty consistently.  There are still some lyrics I can't
figure out, much less memorize, much less rap as fast as him, but it's
coming along.</p>

<p>I recently figured out that "new pad / drink a lid up / throw the
shit out" has got to be "new pad / crinkle it up / throw the shit
out."</p>

<p>I was like, "a lid?  what is he talking about?"</p>

<p class=date>5:01pm</p>

<p>5000 miles traveled on this adventure since Dallas.  I just watched
the zeroes turn over after consciously choosing not to stop at
Newberry Springs, a hot springs camp, clothing optional around the
camp, clothing prohibited in the pools.</p>

<p class=date>5:13pm</p>

<p>Driving into dusk, with the sun setting more to my right than
behind me, I seem to be in a large valley with a few hills in it, and
75%surrounded  by mountains, none of which seem to have snow on top,
so I'll just call them big sharp rocky hills.  Vegetation has been
lots of grasses in clumps and very few trees, almost no cacti.  Some
yucca.  Trees are about 15 feet tall, and more like bushes than
trees.  Some rocks sit patiently by the freeway, possibly waiting for
a ride, or just counting vehicles.  ("Let's play cont The Cars!"
"Okay!"  "There's a car.  There's a car!  There's a car!")</p>

<p>A single set of lines on telephone poles transmit energy or
information along the freeway.  No towers of any variety in sight.
Oh, there are two way out in front of me, with lights blinking.</p>

<p>5020 miles traveled.</p>

<p class=date>5:19pm</p>

<p>I'm a bit tired, and "next services 55 miles" sign got me to stop
here, wherever I am.</p>

<p>5026 miles.</p>
