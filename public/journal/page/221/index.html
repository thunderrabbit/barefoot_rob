<p>Just got some nighttime photos of a logo at Shibuya scramble for a guy
on Fiverr. He&rsquo;s got a pretty interesting project, encouraging
education through what looks like a fantasy adventure motif.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t looked carefully through the materials, but the website is
<a href="https://www.magicaemathematica.com">magicaemathematica.com</a>.</p>

<p>Somewhat foolishly, I forgot to charge my phone so it died after the
took &ldquo;10 or 20 photos&rdquo;.  Yeah, I&rsquo;ve done that before; stress the
battery in a sprint and it dies like boom.  It will come back without
overtly charging it, but I&rsquo;m on the way home already so I hope the
existing photos are okay.</p>

<p>Okay, so that was one order.  The other was to send a postcard (1
order) with a maze on it (2nd order).  I spent a good deal of time on
it, working hard to use bezier curves in Gimp to do it, but my printer
failed to print it the right scale..  or I failed to make the right
width/height ratio on the image and don&rsquo;t know how to tell the printer
to scale it (nor how to scale the bezier curve anchors to fit a new
size image).</p>

<p>I made the md5 cheater script, and want to augment it a bit to do
something entirely different.  I have never really programmed shell
scripts, so we&rsquo;ll see how it goes.</p>

<p>I wonder if I should search for Bash scripting tutorials or stay with
more fundamental *nix code?  I think I&rsquo;ll go for Bash; this project
ain&rsquo;t very important, and I just want to get it done, plus I&rsquo;m
probably the only person who will use it, and I only use Bash.</p>

<p>At the toy store, I found some sets of themed images drawn on some
cards, copyright Stephanie Graegin and produced by
<a href="https://www.eeboo.com/">eeBoo corporation</a>.  I thought &ldquo;these would be
useful during my lessons,&rdquo; thinking my students might enjoy making
stories with the cards as prompts.  Then I was like, &ldquo;AND I can use
them in my Japanese lessons!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I got the &ldquo;Animal Village&rdquo; set, so I&rsquo;m about to learn nouns in
Japanese like fox, skunk, porcupine, squirrel, and platypus&hellip; plus
campfire, guitar, marshmallow (though I bet the last two are just カタ
カナ versions of English words).  I think squirrel is リス.  Then I&rsquo;ll
learn phrases like &ldquo;play guitar&rdquo;, &ldquo;roast marshmallows&rdquo; and &ldquo;hide
behind a tree&rdquo;&hellip;  <em>Then</em> I&rsquo;ll tell stories about a bear trying to
steal candy while the other animals skipped school and ate
marshmallows while the fox played guitar causing the rabbit&rsquo;s
marshmallow to become invisible!  And that&rsquo;s just from the cover art
on the box!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m getting (a little bit) excited about taking lessons again.  Will I
study?  Will I keep it up?  Who knows??!!!!!</p>

<p>Fred and I video chatted for four plus hours while at our respective
offices.  I finished a maze-on-postcard for a guy on Fiverr, and then
read the recent
<a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wwdep/we_are_edward_snowden_laura_poitras_and_glenn/">AMA by Snowden and crew</a>,
and acted as a rubberduck for Fred while he got some code (closer to)
compiled.</p>

<pre><code>HI Sam

On this URL: https://my.atlassian.com/products/index

I see a sideways &quot;Leave Feedback&quot; button (div) on the right side
of my browser.

I wanted to leave feedback that the processes for creating license
keys for SourceTree took about 15 or 20 seconds, which I think is
slow enough that people might give up and stop using your product.

BUT, when I clicked on Leave Feedback, the window that appears
only has space for name and email.  I click [submit] and it gives
an error message:

Oops! Something went wrong...
Value of summary field is either missing or too long.
You must specify a summary of the issue.
Don't worry though! We've logged this problem and will look into it soon!

Before this experience, I had the impression that Atlassian and
all its products were great, rock solid, etc etc.  I really like
the Atlassian brand.  But now I'm like O_o.

- Rob!

<div class="dream">Dreamt Japan was at war and Tokyo had been
attacked.  We were all on a wall outside a highway and scrambled up the
wall when we heard the news.  I tried to put on my armor and as I
watched from bird's eye perspective, an enemy truck invaded the town.
It was more like a "monster truck" chassis, all very flat, with no
structure taller than the wheels (so it could flip upside down and
still roll).  Some of our trucks tried to ram its axles to disable it,
but they were ineffective.

Bryn came to the city for a vacation and I had to tell her we were at
war. she was like, "what?" as if she hadn't heard me.  She couldn't
believe it by looking around; everything seemed fine.  I said we can't
stop here and have to keep walking to another area where we'd be safe
(outside Tokyo).

<div class="dream">
Looking at my left leg + foot skeleton (femur to phalanges), which had
been removed from my body, I was confused how I was still able to
stand on my apparently existing legs.  I determined it was my left leg
that had been removed by looking at the foot of the dismembered limb;
the flesh was (suddenly) all intact, and I could see the big toe, and
could see a large scar on the bottom of the foot.

I was like "yep there's my scar," (*) and thought it was interesting to
easily see it up close now that it had been removed from my body.

My friend was like wow let me see that as he was flexing it then he goes
wow your feet are big!  I go yep!  30シェンチ (Japanese for 30 cm)
</div>

<p>(*) I don&rsquo;t have such a scar in real life, though I did cut the bottom
of my foot one time (though I don&rsquo;t currently recall if it was my left
or right foot)</p>

<hr />

<p>I woke up realizing I hadn&rsquo;t written the war dream when I first had
it; I guess it was a couple hours ago, and I&rsquo;ve lost some detail</p>

<p><em>OH!</em> there were US coin in my dream:</p>

<div class="dream">The US penny had been switched back to wheat
pennies Lincoln pennies were stuck for fifty years and then wheat
pennies were being struck again, and I was reading or watching an
article on the change.

"The face of Lincoln and the numeral 1 make it easy for anyone to
identify the penny" some narration was extolling the penny's virtues.
"Even a person from Palestine can quickly see its value. Some people
think the new wheat pennies are a regression in style, but others are
happy to see the change."
</div>

<p>No pun intended</p>

<hr />

<p>Note this is the second time I dreamt about war and coins (including a
concept of history) after ET Contact meetup nights.  These motifs are
certainly not common in my &ldquo;normal&rdquo; dreams!</p>

<p>A few times while sleeping last night, I bent my legs up to my chest
(to help relax my lower back), but this lifted my futon cover too much
so I got cold and put them back down.</p>

<p>Lin walked with me to Kawasaki station and waved byeeee as I headed
down the steps to the train.</p>

<p>In 東神奈川 station, I got some snacks and headed down to the
platform, from where I saw two excited kids on the train at the next
platform.  They were looking around to see what they could see, so I
waved to them and they waved back and said whatever they said about
some stranger waving to them.  They were on a local train, so my train
arrived before theirs left.  We waved again once I had gotten on my
train; we were now more than a meter closer together and only 1 meter
apart (including two panes of glass and a gap between the trains).</p>

<p>In other news, I emailed JB to see if he knows a Japanese teacher who
lives near me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking copious notes while doing updates for the CB website;
Alfonzo will be moving to a new department soon so I won&rsquo;t be able to
bug him as much with questions.</p>

<p>Today I finished adding the genres to the staging server.</p>

<p>We had a few beeps from the radar detector, a few squeaks from the
magnetometer, and several orbs in photos taken by Esther.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sleeping down in the meditation room under the pyramid.</p>
