<p>Driving to Austin was pretty straightforward, but a bit long.  Not
too terrible.  I listened to Dr R.C. Sproul, some christian theologean
talk about how everything has meaning because God gives meaning to
everything, after "KKDL Muenster Dallas Fort Worth 106.7" was out of
range.  The girl voice who does the legal IDs for them sounds pretty
cute.</p>

<p>Got into Austin and there was a vigil of some sorts blocking up the
streets near the capital building, so I called Bill to find the best
way around it.  Made it here by recognizing Sally's old building,
which is quite close to Fred's.  Yay Sally!</p>

<p>I'm awake and at Kinko's to work on Kim Sawyer's website, updates
on which are due at noon today.  I've got music on in headphones to
keep me focused.  It's due at noon.</p>

<p>Hey, if you're in Dallas area, check out 106.7 KKDL: they play all
dance stuff and they don't play commercials.</p>

<p class=date>9:19am</p>

<p>Ugh.</p>

<p>I'm hating this.  He sent me a .doc file, which I can't read since
I don't have Star Office installed, so I sent it to yahoo and viewed
it with their .doc to .html viewer and grabbed that source, and now am
spending a lot of time modifying it.  It'd be way easier if I knew for
sure what it was supposed to look like instead of making guesses about
what he wanted.</p>

<p class=date>10:49am</p>

<p>okay I'm done editing poetry and will move it to his site now.  I
may have to do some additional edits to it, but hopefully not much.</p>

<p>Super duper excited to see Sally tomorrow!  Fred, Bill and I just
watched <em>Fear of a Black Hat</em> the spoofumentary of NWH, Niggas
With Hats.  "See Niggahs stands for Nice Intelligent .." aw man I
forget what he said but it was funny.</p>

<p>During my drive here to Austin from Dallas, when 70 miles north of
Austin, I was able to hear Clint's Blues In Hi-Fi on KTRU, which is
actually broadcast from an antenna in Humble.  Lotsa miles that signal
traveled.  I called Clint to let him know.</p>

<p>The movie store where we got this movie is pretty cool - um, little
hand written reviews on some of the movie boxes, and a free membership
if you give them a blockbuster card (they destroy them by making them
into decorations on their little tree).</p>

<p>Tired.  Shower then bed.</p>

<p>Marta and I are at the Bibby's, talking with Janette, Joey, Jack.
Rowboat and Matt have already come and gone, though we hoped to see
them as well.</p>

<p>Conversation in the living room with lots of cookies, ice cream,
cookie dough, stawberries, avacado, lemon lime tostitos.</p>

<p>Excellantro.</p>

<p class=date>11:58pm</p>

<p>Just went for a relatively long walk with Janette and Marta,
starting with a tour of the house under construction down the street
that we visited some weeks ago.  It's much darker now since it has a
roof and walls blocking a lot of light.</p>

<p>Saw a guy watching Golden Girls on TV and he was turned around
watching us watch him as we walked by.</p>

<p>Got to a point that Marta was trying to find a splinter in her foot
and Janette walked up to an abandoned house to tinkle by a tree.</p>

<p>Everything came out alright except for the splinter so we decided
to go back.  Sat in a Bobcat and joked that Janette and I could fight
over Marta or try to catch her in our own Bobcat's scoop.</p>

<p>Walked back along a different street and ended up at a dead end
starring a house that looked like a church or a country club.  Turned
around and found a secret alley that we used to escape.  Okay, not
escape, but also not walk all the way back out the way we had
entered.</p>

<p>Janette and I had differences of opinion about which way was a more
direct route to home, so we bet ten dollars on it.  Tried her way
first.  Then we went my way and walked back past the guy with a TV and
Janette recognized it to be Suddenly Susan, and the Marta was all,
"what was it?"  Janette quickly responded "I don't know..." like it
was a huge mystery to all involved, "but Rob thinks it's Suddenly
Susan.."</p>

<p class=date>1:22am</p>

<p>Janette is utterly amazing in her hospitality.  She gave us cookie
tins of cookies on our way out.</p>

<p>Tired on the way to Denton, so I bit hard on my fingers and sang
several iterations of the Bubble Bee Tuna song chorus to stay
awake.</p>

<p>Something ridiculously bad happened on I-45 south, according to Fox
news.  Something about a truck and the driver was pinned and his kid
was killed and traffic has been diverted off the freeway and crews are
working on repairing the freeway and hopefully will have it fixed by
tomorrow evening.</p>

<p>Wow, I say.  Wow.</p>

<p>I wonder, I query, what happened?</p>

<p class=date>2:15am</p>

<p>Turns out some cat drove a tractor trailer around a corner in the
rain and the trailer slid and bonked some columns that had been
supporting an overpass.  The overpass collapsed and crushed the cab,
trapping the driver (who lived), but killed his son who he took with
him on drives occassionally cause they didn't get much time
together.</p>

that I can just connect my computer to any of their network cables.
In this case I've jacked a cable from a computer that wasn't powered

prove interesting.</p>

<p>I like the concept of SINGULARITY:</p>

 our self-guided evolutionary development accelerates enormously
 (powered by nanotechnology, neuroscience, AI, and perhaps uploading)
 so that nothing beyond that time can reliably be conceived." Anders

<p>I think what that describes is a time when we literally cannot
predict the future cause shit is changing so quickly.</p>

                        <p class=date>1:34pm CDT Sunday 8 September 2002</p>

<p class=message>This morning, Gem (ROB) and I (Marta) eagerly awaited
our breakfast in bed.  Since I've been rather sick lately, Cherub and
Dale (my two best friends from karate) called Friday volunteering to
come make us whatever we desired for Sunday breakfast.  I requested a
Mexican burritto with eggs, Cheddar, veggie sausage and salsa.  ROB
felt awkward allowing my peeps, whom he's only met a few times, to
wait upon him hand and foot.  But Cherub (AKA Chucky) explained this
was her way of both caring for "My Marta" and showing ROB her
appreciation for his waiting on me hand and foot over the past week
plus.  He accepted and ordered homemade blueberry pancakes.</p>

<p class=message>Chucky and Dale said they'd be at my apt. by 9:00 to
start, but were delayed until 10:45.  To pass the time, ROB and I
(ordered to stay in bed) played "the Jackie Purdy game".  I should
mention that I am still the undefeated champion of JPG, even having
played several times now with JP herself.  :-) When they finally
showed up, they forgot that we were leaving the door unlocked and
knocked.  We screamed for them to come in, but my bedroom is in the
back.  Finally, ROB crawled out of bed in his undies to crack the door
open and run back.  I giggled as he not-so-sneakily attempted this.
Before long, he also had to "powder his nose" (as I say), so he ran to
the bathroom door across from the kitchen.  Chucky, making her way to
visit my sick ass in bed, was taken quite aback hardly knowing ROB and
not expecting their "brief encounter".  She blushed and covered her
eyes first with her hands, then the bedsheet.  "Hide your shame, Gem!"
I screamed towards him as he returned.  "Hide your shame!"  Although
he tried to stretch a t-shirt, inevitably the commotion brought Dale
running around the corner, "Shame?  What shame?"  But, ROB was back
under the sheets and Chucky off to fetch more pancakes.  </p>

<p class=message>We taught them the game and, although neither felt
comfortable singing in public, we all had a great time.  Eventually,
Chucky turned it into the Movie game where each gives a quote and the
rest guess the movie.  While ROB and I waited for our 12:00 breakfast,
Chucky and Dale could be heard screaming at each other in the kitchen
like a cranky, old married couple.  Gem has pointed out that it was
more of Chucky screaming at Dale, amusing considering he is a
second-degree black belt.  Because we kept receiving orders to "Get
back in bed!", Chucky began bringing chunks of pancakes to hand feed
us just as it was our turn to sing (still playing JPG, of course).
Finally, all four camped out on my bed, picnic style.  Thanks, guys.
It was pointed out to us that although ROB requested the pancakes, he
ate his burritto first.  And I, who requested the burritto, started
with the pancakes.  We both concurred that we were saving the best for
last.  We played the Movie game for a while longer, long enough for me
to learn that I'm much better at storing songs in my head.  Then
Chucky entertained us with a good amount of the Princess Bride (5
mins. worth) she knows by heart.</p>

<p class=message>Dale did the dishes (Chucky's orders) as ROB, Chuck
and I spread out for a nap.  Eventually, Dale joined us and was the
only one to sleep while Chucky and I reminisced and joked around with
Gem.  Although we were all quite comfortable and wanted to stay and
really take a nice nap, ROB and I were running late for an appointment
in Plano.  Hugs and kisses goodbye (mostly me and Cherub... we're
close!), then off.</p>

<p>Chillin' at Best Buy, in line now to get my camera examine by the
tech guys so they can be all, "yup; it doesn't work" and then I cna
get a new camera.  :-)  I'm glad I got the four year guarantee on it
when I purchased it.  Good $60 well spent.</p>

<p class=date>2:50pm</p>

<p>Pooh.  This ain't Walmart or Target where I can just get the shit
exchanged in two seconds.  They will send it far away and it should be
replaced/repaired by 28 September.  Pbbltt.  I shoulda taken it in
sooner.  Ah well.</p>

<p>I gave them Bibby's address for shipping.</p>

<p>Ah; I know why I was surprised.  When I brought my handspring visor
in, I was able to get it replaced immediately.</p>

From: my friend Gin from my YRUU days
Date: 8 Sep 2002 18:08:13 +0000
Subj: Gin in Victoria, Euskadi

Hello Luckies, I hope this day finds you happy and healthy. 

      I am feeling well, and free.  I think I stuck with the pilgrims
about 3 nights and 4.5 days.  I walked south westerly with them as far
as i could stand before heading back into the hills with my compass
and a wish.  It was fun, the intense togetherness. i learned some
Catalan, Italian, Brazilian, and for the first time since
understanding french, spent some time with an older generation of
french people and loved their subtle jokes and comments about the
spanish, themselves, and everyone else.  Too many people for me
though.  I like the lone wolf feeling.  Off the trail i went into the
sierra.  The country people in the Basque land are really...  words
fail me again... nice? Something further than that, but they are
amused to see someone walking around with a back pack, unlike the
villages along the "camino", where i got the feeling the locals
thought anything with a backpack was kin to a rabid rat.

       I found myself crossing 3 sierras the other day, so happy and
taking pictures of myself with the basque flag (i was gifted by a
local along the route) on mountain tops.  I was also gifted a map, in
100% Euskera (the ancient language of the Basques). The towns have
Basque names and Castilian (Spanish) names.  In general, the Basques
resent with fury being a part of spain.  My map is all in Basque, a
language that is as far out as Hungarian, or Finnish.  I love it and
have had a fascination with it since i first heard of it.  On the top
of my 3rd sierra some nights ago, i planted my tent.  It was over 1000
meters to the bottom of the sierra and the night was falling.  I saw
the cow patties.  Up with the tent, it was cold and the wind was
blowing.  I crawled in my sleeping bag and the spectacle began.  First
one cow.  They all had big cow bells on... then another bell,
and another.  All sniffing and probably wondering what the hell kind
of creature could look like my tent.  I once was camping in the
Wichita mountains in Oklahoma, and in the middle of the night a herd
of Buffalo walked by and we were left untrampled.  I remembered that,
and thought that i feared not so much as to worry that a cow would
want to cuddle or worse... so with about 20 cows immediately outside
my tent sounding like a Tibetan concert i fell asleep.  When i woke
up, they were so far away it was silent.  The next morning i woke up
and in my pokey morning routine greeted the cows that were smart
enough not to sleep on the top of that mountain.  I eventually started
down the mountain.  The view was spectacular. 

      About an hour or three into the hike i went into a village,  met
an old woman that pointed out where the water fountain was that did
not contain the "shit chlorine" that they are forcing upon them in
their houses.  Unlike France, the small Spanish villages do not have
pay phones or little stores.  They have bread trucks with obnoxious
horns that sound as they roll in with fresh bread.  I left my back
pack by the fountain and went to get half of a loaf of fresh bread
(baguette).  There was a little blonde headed boy chewing on a piece
of bread, his beautiful mother not far behind.  He followed me back to
the fountain, and his mother and i began to talk.  She asked me where
i was from and when she said "oh, Americana..." it must have been the
look on my face, cause she said, "yea, i know, we Basques feel the
same way when we say we are from the Basque land and people say 'oh,
Spanish'..."   I asked her about the history of the village.  There
are 14 families that live in the village, 4 of them speak Euskera. In
1982 when they were renovating the church, they discovered paintings
from possibly the 13th century that show war scenes, a woman being
raped, a guy pooping in a pot, people killing each other, sacrificial
offerings and other strange paintings that would otherwise not be
found in a church.  I asked her to write down several more words in
Euskera for me, like 'please',  then she gave me a little
Euskera-English  dictionary.  Her name is Estibaliz. 

      I took a westward hike towards Victoria that day.  The evening
came, and someone told me about a monastery called Estibaliz just
about on the trail westwards.  I decided it was a sign i should go and
ask the Fathers if I could camp there.  I met a Father Jose, and he
showed me the church, with relics predating the church and worshiping
the SUN!  He really did not even know how to interpret the holy
relics.  I found it most fascinating.  They looked like celtic relics,
but definitely sun worship, later translated to Virgin Mary- Sun
worship.  There were 7 monks (priests) living there, and he pointed
out that their numbers were dwindling because people were no longer
interested in dedicating their whole lives to celibate worship.  I
told him I was not catholic, and that i had recently taken my name off
of the roster at my church in the name of solidarity with all of
humanity in a growing spirituality, without dogma or religion.  We
talked for hours and he seemed quite stimulated and un-offended about
my personal beliefs.  I in turn had questions for him about
Malchisidek and the Virgin Mary.  He is the author of several books in
Euskera, mostly children's stories he heard as a child in a small
village where he was born near here.  He gifted me with the lightest
of his books, and i have been translating the stories one word at a
time.  I had such a nice time at the monastery, it is a wonder i ever
left.   

      On my solitary path, i have a new anthem that i sing as loud and
as long as i feel.  Last year it was 'Pennies from Heaven' and 'El
Corrido de Durango'.  This year it is an old Irish tune called the
'Rambling Rover'.  It makes me think of all of you, and the times and
adventures we have had together. 

     I arrived in Victoria (Gazteiz in Euskera), and the coldness of
city folks is a slap in the face, but as long as i only look at the
old and the young and the freaks, i don¥t feel so strange.  It was
saturday when i arrived yesterday and after washing half of my clothes
in the sink of the crappy little hotel i found i was too tired to go
find the wild zone.  I did get up this morning to make the discovery. 

    This is such a tiny little country, if i was walking every day,
all day, i could cross it in three days.  I think i will continue in
my search pattern, and spiral around a bit.  Durango is not far from
here, and i want to head into Cantabria then Asturias before i hit
Galicia.  If i could draw a connect the dots in this letter from where
i have come from to where i am and where i want to go, ya'll would
laugh or block me off your list.  It is a little loca, but my
pilgrimage was to bring me to the Pyrenees for the winter then to
here, and to top it off, Finistere (after Santiago).  I am only
ripping my own heart out, and inflating my own blisters, so what the
heck, right? 

     I hope this fall comes on slowly, and we behold the changing
colors of the leaves and the scents in the air.   Please hug each
other for me, and know that you are my co-pilgrims.  Thank you for
your love and your energy, i try to remember all that i have learned
from you in our times together.  UltreÔa (go beyond), gin

<p>Wow.  This is the first time I've been to a Kinko's that charges
for their internet access.  But here is the weirdest part: I am able
to ssh to my account, and therefore assume I can move my journal
entries online via scp, but I cannot get http requests or smtp
requests (web and email).  Wow.</p>

<p>I wonder why they allow some internet traffic instead of disabling
all.</p>

<p class=date>3:25pm</p>

<p>Muwahahaha! Even though part of my journal update process normally
requires a http request, I am able to ssh to my account and run that
perl executable from the command line.  Yay for free semi-internet
access!</p>

<p class=date>3:43pm</p>

<p>Double Muwahahahah!  I got around their system simply by bypassing
a box underneath the desk here.  My IP address jumped from 192.168
something to 10.14 something and now full access!  Whoohoo!!  Jon,
tell Karina or send me her address.  :-)</p>
