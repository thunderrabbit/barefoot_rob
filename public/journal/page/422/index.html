<p>I'm chillin' out in the waiting area before my personal interview.
Brian *just* came out and told me and Frank, "your interviews will be
fairly quick; in both of your cases, the only reason you were not
accepted was for some circumstance regarding your situation."</p>

<p>YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>Woot woot!!!!</p>

<p class=date>1:35pm</p>

<p>Back at Sally's now.  Ecstatic.  Elated.</p>

<p>Lost my parking ticket, paid $14 to get out of the lot.  Exuberant.
108 miles round trip.  Thrilled.</p>

<p>Enormous.</p>

<p>Chilled (heated) in the hot tub; had to jump the fence because
apparently the pool key is different than the outer door key to her
building.  No one else in the hot tub, so after I took a nap, I ran
around its perimeter to make a whirlpool.  Fun stuff.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Took a big ol' fat nap and when the phone rang, I got up and walked
briskly into the mirrored door of her closet.  *BONK*</p>

<p>Hahaha</p>

<p>Sally was stuck at work but gave me directions to the night sail
tonight!</p>

<p>Rick came over to take Sally to work today, so I just farted around
a bit and then went to Nordstrom to pick up my suit.  Got it with a
slight delay since I didn't have my ticket; the guy with whom I spoke
yesterday looked for the suit, then came back to confirm I still
didn't have the ticket.  Then he went back and found the suit.
Whew.</p>

<p>In my mind, I wondered about getting all Strong Attitude if they
couldn't find it, even though I didn't have the ticket, considering I
had told him yesterday I didn't have it.</p>

<p>Then I shifted my thoughts; trusting that it would be found easily
and simply.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Worked on my <a href="https://www.robnugen.com/resume/">resume</a>,
put a closing date on FSD and adding my latest adventures since
FSD.</p>

<p>Watched <em>Changing Lanes</em> at Elizabeth's recommendation
(Barbie's friend who I met in WV) and enjoyed it pretty well.</p>

<pre>
I just watched Changing Lanes, at your recommendation.  I really
enjoyed it; thanks for encouraging me to watch it.  The whole karma
between Samuel L Jackson and Ben Affleck's characters was pretty
impressive.  The movie showed me how making the "right" decision from
moment to moment can have profound effects on one's immediate future.

For the movie specifically, I mostly think that Ben Affleck's
character was bringing most of the negativity that existed into their
relationship.  Samuel L Jackson brought in some, but more often he was
the one trying to make everything right.
</pre>

<p>Then zipped over to Kinko's and printed 3 versions of the map to my
interview tomorrow, copied the recommendations written by Dude,
Maggie, Karla.  Didn't get a recommendation from Kevin, though I may
check in the morning to see if he got one to me in time.  Probably not
unless I wake up with plenty of time.</p>

<p>I'm at UCI now, picking up Sally after work.</p>

<p class=date>5:44pm</p>

<p>Now I'm in Sally's office; she is still working a bit.  She ate
lunch today, so doesn't need the poptarts I brought just in case she
had forgotten.</p>

<p>In the past I have predicted it; today I realize I am living it.</p>

<p>When I have far fewers things to do, things to focus on, I can take
better care of myself, and have more time to care for others.</p>

<p>The only thing I've had to work on the past couple days is get
ready for my interview tomorrow.</p>

<p>In two days, I have bought a new outfit, made some photocopies of
old recommendations, updated and printed my resume.</p>

<p>I note a few assumptions about this:</p>

<p>~) Inexpensive technology of computers, internet, photocopiers has
helped a lot.</p>

<p>!) Not having to work for food has helped a lot.</p>

<p>Number (!) may have great implications, all the way from having
resources available, to this whole society I'm living in, where I can
easily just wander in and out of Sally's apartment complex and her
apartment to chill and munch and do whatever I want.  Or that may all
just be a facade for the universe simply providing me with that which
I need to follow this life process.</p>

<p>@) There is a fine line; I could easily do too little and suddenly
feel my life brings nothing of value to the world, that I am useless.</p>

<p>#) I've had to give up a lot to have so few responsibilities.</p>

<p>$) Giving up a lot is exactly what has given me such freedom.</p>

<p>Last night Sally invited me to a Afro-Cuban drumming awesome
performance for something de something.  Excellent music for Rob's
Crazy Dance, on which 3 strangers commented positively.</p>

<p>I moved to the back of the club (The King King Club in LA) because
there was much more room to dance and the performers could still be
easily heard.  At the front of the room people were all packed in too
tightly to really dance more than one knee (I had maintained enough
room to get a few steps back and forth to dance, but it wasn't enough
for me) so I went back to the back and I just let the music move me in
some combination of Rob's Techno, Rob's Quickfeet, Rob's Big Dance,
plus my new wacked out Rob's Broken Leg styles.  When I first got back
there no one was dancing around me, but after about a song worth of
seeing me just let it all hang loose, a few of them started to boogie
down as well, and some cat named Craig asked me between songs what my
style was. When I told him all I do is continuously make shit up, he
was all, "no way man, that looks just like that Brazillian dance they
do," but he couldn't think of the name, so I asked Sally, but couldn't
quite hear what she said (sounded like the spanish word for
grandmother, abuela, but like cabuerra maybe [found out later it's
called Capoeira]) exactly but that cat was sure I was doing that style
from Brazil (Sally had described it as a combo fight/breakdance
style).</p>

<p>I got so sweaty in the back that I took off my red with black
dragon print button down shirt to reveal my red Trix Are For Kids! T.</p>

<p>Another guy kept looking over at me and like smiling, and then
later asked retorically, are you doing techno or brazillian dance?
cause he could clearly see both in my moves.</p>

<p>While there, Sally saw her old drum teacher from Austin!  He's
moved to Huntington Beach now, but even more amazing is that though
she had no conscious awareness of him, Sally suddenly thought,
"[what's-his-name] should totally be here," she looked over and there
he was.  Sally is more amazed by this coincidence than I.  I *know*
she didn't have to see him to know he was there; sometimes a body just
knows.</p>

<p>On the way out, the tall bouncer guy, Chief George told Sally she
should join the tall people club.  He commented on my dancing, "you
were really cuttin' up the carpet.." which is amazing cause it was a
concrete floor.</p>

<p>We got lost in Hollywood but still found Bossa Nova and ate pizza
and fried yucca and two other something elses.  So funny after the
meal Sally was cold so had the heater on, but trying to defrost the
windshield with it, but it only cleared the inside up like 4 inches,
so she was all trying to wipe it off with a napkin.  Finally I
convinced her to switch the heat to cool and that helped clear it
up.</p>

<p><a href="/images/travel/US/California/west_side.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/US/California/thumbs/west_side.jpg" align="left"></a>
Drove up and down Hollywood Boulevard and took a few pics of the
well lighted famous things.  (The width of Hollywood Boulevard is the
same as West Gray.  But West Gray's Christmas decorations are just
cute compared to Hollywood's, with white lights in paisley spirals
across the entire street, every half block it seemed.  For blocks and
blocks and blocks.)  Got more lost and found Beverly Hills, Bel Aire
(I kept asking, "is this where Fresh Prince is from?"  "yes."), and
UCLA (I got a picture for Jason of me throwing the west side gang sign
in front of the UCLA sign).  We did not see the Hollywood sign.</p>

<p>Wow.  What a great great night!</p>

<p>At this moment, I'm wearing undies, shorts, and my red Trix Are For
Kids! t-shirt that Jennifer gave to me some time ago.</p>

<p>("I'm glad the shirt talks to you," she said.)</p>

<p>In a few hours, I will be wearing undies, black shiny shoes, dark
socks, undershirt, button up shirt, tie, suitpants, suitcoat.</p>

<p>I'm off to Fashion Island.</p>

<p class=date>11:44am</p>

<p>oops.  hang on one sec.</p>

<p class=date>11:56am</p>

<p>Well, I lost the claim ticket for my suit, but the guy smiled "it's
done by last name," so I'm not worried about it.  I trust no one will
find the ticket and be all, "hello, my name is Mr Nugen; I believe you
have a suit for me," cause my first name is on there too.</p>

<p>Anyway, I rolled into the parking lot playing Eminem with
my windows down and system up, strolled into Nordstrom beat boxing and
wearing the above mentioned outfit plus sandals.  Walked up to some
cat in the men's department, "I don't know if I'm out of my league or
not, but I've got about $500 and need to get a suit, tie, shirt,
shoes."</p>

<p>"We can do it for about that," he said.</p>

<p>Excellent.</p>

<p>In the end, I got suit/tie/shirt for like $600 and shoes/shoe trees
for $400.  Very exciting.  if spending a G on clothes is exciting.</p>

<p>Suit is being adjusted so I can pick it up tonight or tomorrow
morning.</p>

<p>Cool cat named George who helped me get the shoes.  I just layed it
out for him: I don't know what's fashionable, but I'm going to teach
English in Japan, blah blah, so he knew what to get me.  He's got an
uncle in Tucson, and we talked a bit about what it might be like in
Japan, etc.</p>

<p>I gave him my adventure card cause he was cool.</p>

<p>I slept beautifully on Sally's couch until the bright warm
California sun came to visit on its way to the ocean.  Called Sally to
see what time to pick her up and she said 6.  So I've got time to ride
around Crystal Cove on my bike.</p>

<p>Byee!</p>

<p>Sally has been randomly singing the Ants and Cheese song in various
forms and to various tunes.  So funny!  It's taking over the world!</p>

<p>Quickly:</p>

<p>how strange that I literally feel <em>emotionally</em> better now
that I can send email from my computer (and not have to use
Yahoo!)...</p>

<p>Weird weird weird.</p>

<p>I haven't figured out (or tried to) yet what that's all about, but
it sure is interesting.</p>

<p>Apparently Kinko's internet access blocks port 25.. pooh.</p>
