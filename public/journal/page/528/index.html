<p>Hello gods and goddesses!  i think i will start there
since it will be a reoccuring theme.  I figure that we
are all attached via something greater than ourselves
and probably equally yet uniquely.  Since I have so
much thanks to give I think it is more correct to
thank you all so the message will be more directly
delivered, OK!  I bow down before each and every in
gratitude and celebration.  I learned how to say
&ldquo;Fairy Tale&rdquo; in French today.  A very timid woman who
is an immigrant from Romania asked me how my trip was
going.  I had been thinking for days that it is rather
like a renisance fairy tale, with a knight in shining
armor and grand adventures every day and occasional
perils and sleepy nights on piles of fresh hay and
kind and loving people along the merry way and more
shooting stars than i can count and so on&hellip;
My good friend from Holland, &ldquo;Ron who loves the sun&rdquo;
parted via a blue mercedes that stopped for us in the
rain a week ago.  I have had bad experiences
hitchhiking in the rain, and the chances of getting a
ride with two people are less than with one, but I did
not get in, i just confirmed that the next stop was
the train station.  I am such a closure junkie that a
swift good-bye was like donating blood-uncomfortably
unloading precious materials as quick as possible.<br />
Altough I love traveling alone for reasons that i will
forever disclose the comfort of having somone to watch
my back and cuddle with and hold hands with and gather
fire wood and be the man for my woman was and is and
will be such an earthly pleasure that i revel in the
experience and the thought.  I thank the universe for
sending him to me and i feel fairly confident that
even if he had known what was in store, the flying
dutch adventureman in him would still have joined me
for the walk.  He walked me from the south of the
north to the north of the south of France, in very
good form and excellent humor, a big round of ovations
and several &ldquo;bravos!&rdquo;, a kiss and a hug and a note of
the sincere courage i know it takes to submit oneself
to the wild world and the unknown.  Thanks brotha&rsquo;, it
was a pleasure i will never forget!  It took several
days to rehabilitate, and to settle back into the
silence and certainly coax the little girl in me to
come out to play, we have such fun together!<br />
Of course the first night that i was back on the road
by myself again i found the most unbelievable place to
camp.  There are not that many mountains around here,
and this was not by French standards a mountain, cause
i was to the top in 15 minutes, but the hill was
decorated with vinyards and freshly plowed wheat
fields, with huge piles of wheat and hay to nest in.
The view over the surrounding countryside of forest
and farm land and sunflower fields and corn fields and
the little ancient towns that speckled the other hill
tops, and the sky and the feeling of freedom in the
wind with my tent planted on the hay on the very top
of the french hill on the mild summer&rsquo;s eve  was a
gift that i felt the bitter sweet irony of that it was
for my eyes only.  Ron told me many times that no one
would believe him about our adventures. Akin to the
Barron von Munchhousen- who really did unbelievable
things on his adventures, but of course no one
believed him when he recanted his stories.  yep, gin
from Munchhousen.  So, slowly I tread towards
Bordeaux, had i even walked backwards for 4 hours a
day i would have already been there, but  this last
week has been interesting.  It took me a couple of
days to get back into the swing of walking 8 hours a
day, cause i don&rsquo;t think Ron and I obsessed with
fanitical hiking, naturally. ( Alone there is not much
else to do between naps.)  I had a 35
kilometer day and camped in the woods behind a fence
and a no trespassing sign that- made me feel
comfortably protected for some reason.  The next day i
got up after the rain stopped and hiked another 25
kilometers to find myself back in the same spot!  This
was a true challenge, and an obstacle that faith and a
small bottle of cognac helped cure.  I call these
zones the twilight zones, and this is not the first,
but the best!  The next day i finally made it 15
kilometers down the road to Blaye (meaning glad in
Dutch) and called my good friend in Ariege (very south
of France in the Pyrenees mountain range) and she told
me she is making good money playing celtic and
bluegrass music for large crowds with her fiddle and
her man.  She also offered me her mountain home for
the winter, which is a different house than I was
offered before- this house is only a 20 minute hike up
the mountain instead of a 4 hour one (although the 4
hour hike is worth the view).
That is my good news for my mother and any other
adventurer who thinks they can handle the extreme
mountain winter for a week or two.   So, after i
started out of Blaye i made it barely a mile and ran
into this crazy bus, a one-of-a-kind Alps bus with a
Zurich license plate.  I stopped to say hi in Zuri
german and some germans stopped as well. We sat around
all night speaking german, zuri german, french and
english drinking as many varieties of alcohol and
filling the night with laughter.  The next morning we
had breakfast, in good suisse and french fashion and
eventually parted.  I didn&rsquo;t even make it a mile
before my small road turned into a vineyard.  I asked
a family that was in their yard which way i should go
to avoid the highway and they kindly invited me in for
a hangover cocktail, which i declined for a cola.
When they discovered i was a pilgrim on the &ldquo;Route du
St. Jaques du Compostella&rdquo; in galicia,spain- they
quickly called their neighbor who had walked the trail
some years back while overcoming cancer.  After a nice
lazy saturday afternoon with that family, i was
escorted to the pilgrims house where they promptly
invited me to stay for a couple of days.  Even though
it is slow, i learned while living in in Landcon
jungle to never refuse an offer of hospitality, it is
rude and offensive if it is made sincerely.  They were
so sincere I was in the bath tub as my clothes were
washing in nearly boiling water in no time.  My new
washing method is very hot water only- and all my
clothes are dark(to hide the dirt).  They were kind
enough to put me to work, cause i really hate to stay
for more than one meal if i can&rsquo;t do something
productive and helpful around the house.  I was a
gardner for a glorous day, and there were so many
tomatoes in their garden, it was fantastic.
Scrumptious!  They wanted me to stay longer, but i
hate to overstay my welcome, even though the little
girl i played with next door begged me to stay a week
and i could have found lots of work in their garden, i
departed.  I probably made it 4 miles today on my
way south, really starting to believe my backpack
weighs 40 kilos, when an elderly gentleman said
something i wasnt familiar with.  I asked what it was
he said and he said &ldquo;you are beautiful&rdquo;,  people are
always shocked by my beauty, i mean the very large
back pack i sport in the middle of the sunniest summer
days.  So he took me by the arm and invited me in for
a glass of water.  His son and daughter in law with
his grandaughter came home later with the initial
surprised statement something along the lines of &ldquo;lets
look at what the cat dragged in&rdquo;, this old guy doesn&rsquo;t
get much respect around here, but he is divine.  These
people are fascinated as well with the grand
pilgrimage and being Texan is not the worst american
origin, and most generously they offered me dinner and
a shower and a bed and the internet for the whole
night!!! And we all know by now my long winded run-on
motor electric correspondence could take all night.<br />
This is France, the people are golden, the culture is
magnificent and it is an honor to finally understand
most of what is being said.  I even had a deep
conversation today as well as write for my first time
in french!!! ! It is poetry, and they express
themselves with that in mind.  Thanks for everything
everybody and pass it on please!
     I began my pilgrimage toward Le Mont St. Michelle
two months ago today(13th),  and set out for spain
from there on the 14th of June. When i set out the
purple fox glove were in bloom and i passed thousands
of happy daisies every hour.  Now that i am in the
south the roadsides and pathways are alive with thick
mint patches, marjoram, fennel, rose hips, sweet black
berries hanging by the ton off of everything, and
wildflowers with rainbows of varieties.  This is wine
country, and the square miles and miles of grape vine
smiles are turning purple! I walked through the cognac
region and did not buy special cognac cause they only
sold it by the big bottle, but i did get an almond
cognac aperitif, and it was really good in coffee.  I
have to admit that i pulled a big &ldquo;duhhh&rdquo; and did not
walk through Roquefort (like the blue cheese) but
Rochfort.  Ron and i had a great time in that town,
and we still celebrated by the river with a blue
cheese and a red wine and then some.  Today i decided
i will head south east toward St Girone in Ariege
instead of walking along the coast toward the Basque
Country and then through the whole mountain range back
east.  This will cut off several hundred kilometers
and is the more intelligent decision (i tell myself),
i might walk the canals to the Pyrenees.  Anyway,
Bordeaux is only 40 Kilometers form here, and i hope i
have not ruined my lucky streak with the french
hospitality by telling ya&rsquo;ll about it. Sometimes
things are too special to talk about, it kind of
interrupts the magic flow, but this is probably part
of the flow, so like i say &ldquo;let it go&rdquo;!   love
ya&rsquo;ll&hellip;Ultreia            gin<br />

                        <p class=date>10am Sunday 12 August 2001</p>

<p>Wow.  Last night was quite a wonderful whirl of
activities!</p>

<p>First we hung out and Jon and Kaylen's house, at a
pool party for our men's groups and women's groups.  I
chilled in the pool for a while and then played ping
pong with people and then with Rebecca.  And then
Rebecca and I played ping pong without the table. 
Just volleyed the ball back and forth until it was
nearly dark.</p>

<p>Then inside, a group of us enjoyed a play-filled
game of Guesstures and laughed a lot.  Rebecca and I
tickle wrestled while sitting together on the couch. 
She's got sharp claws.</p>

<p>- - -</p>

<p>Wende and I vacated around 9:30, drove to my boss
Karla's, her husband Brad's, their daughter Erika's
combined birthday party.  The sum of their ages is
121, and now Erika is legal to drink so they rented St
Arnold's Brewery and a band and hotdogs from James
Coney Island and a whole pile of people.</p>

<p>Wende wasn't up for that much craziness, so she
went home; I had to assure her I would be fine and
could get a ride home.</p>

<p>I had a great time talking to peeps and dancing
Rob's Subdued Crazy Dance and all kindsa fun.  I
secured a ride home with my friend Brian, but at the
last minute, Beth offered to drive me home because she
wanted to ask me about <a
href="https://www.heartstormproductions.com/">The
Techno Cosmic Mass</a> which I helped create in
December 1999.  Here is <a
href="https://new.robnugen.com/journal/1999/12/15/catch-up/">my
entry</a> about it.</p>

<p>Beth dropped me off and I gave Wende a kiss and
called Will to see if I was too late for ultimate.  I
told them I'd be late, and it turns out I was too
late.  I was about to go to bed then I remembered I
had been invited to visit Erika and her friends at
their motel after the 121 party!</p>

<p>On the way, I stopped by KTRU to say HI to Erin,
the DJ after me, and I met the DJ's after her, which
include Andrew, who I knew from way back in my days at
SPB at University of Houston!!  Wow!  Great fun to
chill with them for a bit.</p>

<p>Left KTRU, got to Erika et. al. motel, found them,
we visited the pool which was locked because it was
after hours, so Holly climbed the fence (and busted
her butt when she fell over).  I just sat with my feet
in the pool along with some of them, and the others
swam.  We got kicked out of the pool after almost an
hour and went up to their rooms.</p>

<p>They had a big carboard box full of plain hotdogs
(in the buns) from the party.  Blain, Holly, and/or
Hunter each had one.  Bluh.  But hey, food is food,
right?</p>

<p>We watched part of <em>Whipped</em>, starring
Amanda Peet and then as basically the night was over,
Wende called and requested that I come home.</p>

<p>I did; we talked about it this morning.  She said
that she didn't think it was normal or appropriate for
me to engage in such late night activities.  I
anti-agree; I had a great time; I'm sure we'll discuss
it more.</p>

<p>We are going to Gallery Furniture today, to look
for a chair for Wende.  I have never previously been. 
In a way this seems like a big deal to me.  I have
watched that store grow from a little tin barn to a
huge giant two or three story brightly colored
mega-barn.</p>

<p>I have seen and heard a zillion annoying Gallery
Furniture ads on TV and radio, and I must say, "that
guy's got persistence."</p>

<p>I've heard they have free food in the store.  I've
heard that Mattress Mac greets everyone at the door. 
We'll see.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>hmmm..  This is interesting.  <a
href="https://www.risnews.com/consumerstudy/gallery_furniture.htm">This</a>
says "The [Gallery Furniture] website allows consumers
to peer through 48 live interactive cameras
distributed
       around the store. Using special software from
Perceptual Robotics, consumers can pan,
       tilt, and zoom around the store."</p>

<p>Ironic is that their website is not responding
now.</p>

<p class=date>5pm</p>

<p>Wow.  I was quite impressed with the amount of
furniture they have.  Packed full.  just enough room
to walk between most of the displays.  We scoped out
most of the store, and found the styles too
overstuffed.  We did munch free pie from House of
Pies, and free drinks and bought a personal size
cheese pizza for $2.50.  And I watched some kids bowl
on one of the four bowling lanes.</p>

<p>Got to meet Mattress Mac, the ower, who was
basically too busy to look into anyone's eyes as he
spoke.  A bit anti-climactic, but no worries.  Now I
can say I've been to Gallery Furniture.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Afterward we went to Ikea, bought a chair and
ottoman.  Thanks to Eric and Meredith for helping us
carry them upstairs!</p>

<p>This is part of my evaluation of SWUUSI; if you
want to use it anywhere, please do.  And maybe let me
know if it has helped you in some way.</p>

<pre>
<b>Is there anything else that you would like to add
that will help district leaders to understand the
youth camp experience?</b>

The awesomeness of SWUUSI youth camp cannot be
adequately described.  It must be experienced.

YRUU, including SWUUSI has literally saved the lives
of youth who felt they had *no where* to turn, no
friends who loved them.  I can think of 5 right now.  
 This is a place where youth can *play* safely.  True
play in its highest form, like kittens in a new world,
with no egos in the way.

Think of times when you feel truly safe, truly at
home.  That is SWUUSI youth camp.

Think about times when you laugh until tears are
pouring from your face, until your sides hurt from
laughing so hard.  That is SWUUSI youth camp.

When you work so hard and get so sweaty and look back
after a full day and see how much *good* you have
added to the world.  That is SWUUSI youth camp.

When the friendship connections are so great, so deep,
so magnificently entrenched in your soul, that no one
can *ever* take it away.. That is SWUUSI youth camp.

         - - - - -

I have heard a rumor that some people believe the
power shuffle is a negative thing and should be
removed or otherwise altered. SWUUSI youth camp is the
safest place in the world for power shuffle.  The
power shuffle worship brings to light insecurities,
old wounds that have been emotional sores for years.  
SWUUSI youth camp provides a safe place to reveal
those wounds, to find that there is no shame in the
confusing feelings that have been stuffed for so many
years.   The adult staff at SWUUSI youth camp includes
adults who *care* about the youth, and will support
the youth in their crisis.    Some adult staff at
SWUUSI youth camp are professional trained
social/psychological/spiritual workers in their
professional lives.  There could be no safer
environment for such issues to come up.  People pay
<b>big money</b> to have professionals counsel them. 
At SWUUSI, the counseling is immediate and it's free. 
And it's loving and supportive.

If the youth goes home and is now able to reveal some
of these issues to adults in their home lives - to
their ministers, to their parents, to their
counselors, then SWUUSI youth camp has helped save a
life.

Subject: bigger can of worms

A real project manager type person could be super duper most excellent.
There's a part of me who just wants someone to handle/balance the incoming
stuff and prioritize it, and tell me what needs to be worked on.

However,

The big thing that I'm afraid to say/suggest is that I *really* want to
travel and ride my bike across the US and/or Europe and around the perimeter
of Australia.  (Ultimately, I want to shift my career to leading youth group
tours to Europe, Australia, etc.  Maybe just during the summer, when they
are out of school.)

G3 is not *quite* in a state where I can feel happy leaving it, but I think
it's close.  And I'm not suggesting that I actually leave bye-bye
permanently.

But I am open to the idea of taking time off without pay.  I'm considering a
month total off next year.   1 week in February (to learn Spanish
intensively in Mexico), 2 weeks in June for wedding etc, 1 week in July for
youth camp.

And, I am open to the idea of time off as part of my salary (so $$ stays
constant over the span of the year, but I get more vacation)..

Right now I'm only writing to you, Karla (but feel free to talk to Kevin if
you want); I have a great deal of fear about

1) reaction from others ("Why is Rob treated differently?")
2) fear that I won't be *able* to ride across Europe or the US
3) other random feelings that I can't pinpoint

I *love* the work environment here.  It's more than just not having to wear
shoes.  The energy is great.  The win-win solutions/attitudes are great.

I am pretty sure I could be making 20-30k more per year somewhere else, but
this place is great.

Big sigh.   Thank you.

    - Rob

I think that the idea of you leaving for 4 weeks next year is not out of the
question as long as we plan it in advance.  Don't worry about people
thinking Rob is being treated differently.  We try to treat each person
differently and don't mind it at all.  You are becoming a big part of the
company.  You are taking on a load and it is wonderful to have you here.  I
agree that you could be making more elsewhere - I hope that it will pay off
for you in the future - as well as now - enjoying the 'energy'.  I think
that you are a wonderful person to have around - not just for your
programming, but also for your attitude towards feedback.  We should all be
using you as our role model on that characteristic.  Patrick and I have
been talking about planning a little company one day - timeout.  We might do
some fun things- but also, want to do some planning for our growth so that
things are not quite as spur of the moment as they are now.  I hope you grow
more into the role of seeing yourself as one of the builders of the company
and think of it as your company to build.

You also have tremendous integrity and can continue to help by being a truth
speaker.

Deep sigh!

K.

<p>Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back was great!!!</p>

<p><b>If you haven't seen Jay and Silent Bob Strike
Back, and don't want any hints or commentary, do not
read this entry!!</b></p>

<p>If you liked their other films, you'll love this
one!  If you haven't seen it, and don't want any hints
or commentary, do not read this entry!!</p>

<p>Last chance. Do not read this if you wish to view
the movie in its pure form.</p>

<p>So the movie was great.  Super special thanks to
Molly for getting tickets, and to both Molly and Will
for picking me up for the screening.  Thanks to Jeff,
who we think gave the tickets to Molly.</p>

<p>Truth is, I didn't totally like Clerks, and I
haven't seen Chasing Amy.  But I really liked Mall
Rats and I loved loved loved Dogma.</p>

<p>In the end credits, I noticed Alanis Morrisette who
apparently appeared in the movie, and I was all,
"where???"  and then the closing was so perfect. 
Alanis as God to close the movie was cute, classy, and
cool.  Cooler than alliteration.</p>

<p>The alliteration at the Mirimax entrance..
something with a bunch of T's was funny, but I didn't
write it down.</p>

<p>I loved the Scooby Doo sequence.  "How come when we
hitchhike, it's like we're stuck in a fuckin'
cartoon???"   and then presto - there's the Mystery
Machine.    And I recognized it too, but as the camera
stayed looking at it, it looked less and less like the
MM.  Did you notice that?  Weird.</p>

<p>Funny how they were all cursing.  And smoking up
dancing half naked, at least in Jay's dream.  Did you
catch what Scooby said?  The audience was laughing too
loudly for me to catch it.</p>

<p>Um, what else?  Scene that reminded me of Harrison
Ford in that movie where he's running from the bus
crash where he had been a prisoner, but he got out. 
What was that?  Oh <em>The Fugitive</em>.  Anyway, in
the tunnel that poured out over the Hoover Dam
reminded me of that movie.  I don't think that guy
would have survived, but I enjoyed being able to see
so clearly that the footage was shot of a guy running
on a treadmill or something and losing his hat.  Nice.
 We can use that in our movie.</p>

<p>All the references to all the other movies in the
world!!  As soon as they had Suzanne in the basket of
the bike, I knew it would be ET.  That was
hilarious!!!!  What a brilliant plot connection to get
them into the set of their arch nemesis of the
week.</p>

<p>"Hey, with all the money, you can fly around the
country and kick their asses..."  That wasn't the
exact quote, but as *soon* as he said it, I thought
"sequel!!" but they showed it!! hahahaha!! 
Excellent!</p>

<p>And near the very beginning, they had a Unitarian
reference!!!  Whoo Hoo!!</p>

<p>And I was pleased to immediately recognize the song
by Run DMC!!  I recognized the artist, not the song,
which I had never previously heard.</p>

<p>During the movie, I wrote a lot of quotes:</p>

<p>"What the hell is the Internet?"</p>

<p>"Who would pay to see that?"</p>

<p>"Who the hell heard of a ticket for a bus? 
Remember when we used to ride that shit to school
every day for free?"</p>

<p>"We're stuck in a fuckin' cartoon."</p>

<p>"Love, Jay and Silent Bob"</p>

<p>"Jay and Justice sittin' in a tree
f-u-c-k-i-n-g"</p>

<p>"Dude, I think I just filled a cup."</p>

<p>"Brent, tells these sillies that girls don't
fart."</p>

<p>"I'm down with this because I love animals."</p>

<p>"Look, fuck that fat fuck!"</p>

<p>Two devils on his shoulders  hahah
<br>"We bitch slapped that mother fucker and sent him
packin'.  Now it's smooth sailin'"</p>

<p>"Animal tranquilizer! this shit fucks you up like
good shit!"</p>

<p>"What the fuck, the little stoner was right!"</p>

<p>"Yeah I know it's sad but what the fuck are we
supposed to do about it?"</p>

<p>song: "justice is dead or so jay thinks."</p>

<p>"die you super monkey fuck!  [auug!!]"</p>

<p>"the only thing I do recognize is a political
fiasco that I am about to avoid by letting these peple
go."</p>

<p>"fuck beans, that was them wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"flee fat ass flee!"</p>

<p>"just like winnie the pooh."</p>

<p>"man who the fuck just steals monkey."</p>

<p>"That is one fine boy you are raising."</p>

<p>"what? it's not like cheatin', justice blew
up."</p>

<p>"you dudes gettin medical up in jersey?"</p>

<p>"miramax counts for 75 percent of my business out
here!"</p>

<p>"where we takin it from gus?"
<br>"I'm busy!! [counting money]"</p>

<p>"there's a script?"
<br>"you wouldn't last a day on the creek."</p>

<p>"how do you know he doesn't smoke monkey pole?"</p>

<p>"yea, in prison he'll be the pie."</p>

<p>"No, you the man and that's the problem."</p>

<p>"damn this must have sent them back a couple
hundred bucks."</p>

<p>"I was going to call it NWP."</p>

<p>"man this movie is going to make <em>house
party</em> look like <em>house party 2</em>!"</p>

<p>"I thought you blew up, boobo kitty fuck."</p>

<p>"crazy crackers with guns! time for me to get my
black ass out of here."</p>

<p>"only on the outside."</p>

<p>"that's what the internet is for: slandering others
anonymously."</p>

<p>"fuck you, you already said 1/2 you can't take it
back."

<p>- - - - </p>

<p>That's all the quotes I wrote.</p>

<p>As the movie turned into credits, some people left.
 A guy yelled from the audience, "fuckin' sit down and
pay your respects!!"</p>

<p>Stay for the credits.  They are funny and the first
song is crude and funny.</p>

<p>Excellent excellent Kevin Smith movie.  I hope he
makes a mint.</p>

<p>Molly, Will and I are at the sneak preiew of
<em>Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back</em>!!  The crazy
thing is that we were driving and we got to Beltway 8.
 How did we miss Dunvale???  Weird.  We turned around
and went down Westheimer and found it.  Fortunately we
were not too much later.</p>

<p>When Erika called today to talk to her mom, she
asked also to talk with me.  Karla transferred her
over, and was all, 'Rob, it's Erika for you.'</p>

<p>Her voice reminded me of Hal, the computer in 2001.
 (I still haven't seen that movie,)  I was reminded of
the famous line, 'I'm sorry Dave, I can't do
that.'</p>

<p>I was impelled to answer in a similar voice, but I
had to think quickly for something that would make
sense.  I got it:</p>

<p>"Hallo, Clarise."</p>

<p>"Dude! I've got goosebumps now! Why did you do
that?  Auugghh."</p>

<p>Wow.  I can imagine it would be disconcering. 
<p class=grafitti>This is Molly interjecting secretly
while Rob pees.</p>

<p>I hope she doesn't have nightmares about calling me
at work.  ;-)</p>

<p>Ah.  The show sorta begins.  A guy up front is all,
"HI, my name is ___ with Dimension Films!  Welcome to
the sneak preview of Jay and Silent Bob Strike
Back!"</p>

<p>(Cheering)</p>

<p>"Okay, who stars as Silent Bob?"</p>

<p>KEVIN SMITH!</p>

<p>"Who directed the film?"</p>

<p>KEVIN SMITH!</p>

<p>"Who wrote the film?"</p>

<p>KEVIN SMITH!</p>

<p>"Kevin Smith rules, right??"</p>

<p>(cheering)</p>

<p>"How many of you have seen Clerks?"</p>

<p>(show of hands)</p>

<p>"How many of you have seen Mall Rats?"</p>

<p>(show of hands)</p>

<p>"How many of you have seen Chasing Amy?"</p>

<p>(show of hands) and "unfortunately," came the
remark from a girl in the front row.</p>

<p>"Haha.  Yeah, everyone's a critic. ...  In a few
years, you'll actually know what some of those words
mean."</p>

<p>(cheering..)</p>

<p>"The price of the free ticket is to tell all your
friends that Kevin Smith is back and it's a kick ass
movie!"</p>

<p><p class=date>7:33 pm</p>

<p>He left, but the movie didn't start.</p>

<p>The girls next to us have been here for 2 hours,
playing Magic the whole time.  They just scooted over
to give up the seat in between them on which they were
playing.</p>

<p>so we got to scoot one seat closer to the
center.</p>

<p>The guy talked... The movie should go on now!!</p>

<p class=date>7:34 pm</p>

<p>The music just came back on.

<p>ah they were waiting for him to get get back with
his snack.</p>

<p>Instantly into the movie.  No trailers.</p>

<p>Next entry you <b>must not read</b> unless you want
me to give away the movie to you.</p>

What to wear on surveillance:

1) always dress comfortable

2) don't dress loud (dark clothing is preferred)

3) wear clothes that fit the weather

4) bring a different shirt (in case you get made)

5) have a hat with you (for change in look)

6) sunglasses

7) comfortable shoes

8) depending on your case, you may need a nice set of
clothes with you

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>at a rally we were playing a game
outdors - baseball, but the rules were arbitrary and
confusing and very frustrating when people weren't
paying attention and didn't care what was going on . 
I cared though, and I actually got angry at my youth. 
we were just playing a game and I got mad for losing. 
I knew that I shouldn't be getting mad, but I just
couldnt't help it.  I was trying to not yell and be
all mad....</p>

<p class=dream>Driving my car north on I-45 toward
church, I got to use the exit to the overpass to
woodlands parkway for the first time since it was
built.</p>

<p>(This has been quite exciting fo me to watch in
real life as they build it; it will cut 5 minutes off
my drive time to group.)</p>

<p class=dream>so in my dream it finallly opened and I
could see from way far back that there were in fact
cars on it.  I had wished to be the first car on it,
but I wasn't there when they opened it, so oh
well.</p>

<p class=dream>As I approached I could see that it was
quite popular, and was actually somewhat backed up,
</p>

<p class=dream>I began to drive up the slope, but I
was driving Scott, a standard, and I wondered if I
would be able to make it all the way up the slope
without stalling the car</p>

<p class=dream>as we started up the incline, I found
myself on all fours, walking my way up the hill,
slower and slower, and all the cars ahead of me 
disappeared ahead over the overpass and I looked
behind me and somehow there were no cars piling up
behind me.  I was thankful for that.  The sideways
bank of the road was steeper and steeper, until it was
tilting so far left that I was almost able to stand on
the inside wall of the turn.</p>

<p class=dream>The inner wall became discontinuous and
I recognized this was  to disperse the rain more
evenly  over traffic below.</p>

<p class=dream>The road surface became discontinuous 
as I followed it and it became more sparse.  I kept
following it up, but soon discovered it ended, and I
had somehow walk/crawled up the wrong part of the road
and I neeeded to jump over a gap in the road.   </p>

<p class=dream>Cars at 50 miles per hour could make
this jump no problem, but I could not.  In fact, by
going so slowly, I had somehow missed the correct part
of the road altogehter.  </p>

<p class=dream>I marveled at how the engineers must
have been brilliant to create such a road surface that
looks so different at different sepeeds.</p>

<p class=dream>Unfortunately a car was coming and I
had no where to move out of its way and it ran me
over. and I woke up.</p>
