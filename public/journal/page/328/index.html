<p>I've memorized the first seven lines of my speech.   That's almost
the first page.  Killa.</p>

<p>It goes something (*) like this:</p>

<pre>
Watashi wa Rob Nugen des.

Watashi wa senkyuhyakunanajunenni America de umarete, Texas de
ryoushinto, kyoudaito, ishouni, sundemashita.

Texas wa America no minamichuouniari; Mexico to kokyouseshi

<p>Work was kinda bad today; just... tsk.  Voice went from silent
stares to a guy saying the moon landing was faked (according to
someone he had heard) and that the US developed the technology to fly
to the moon to strenghten the US military.  It sounds likely, but
still I hate to have it shoved at me.  One cat defended the US,
reminding us that the internet was created originally as a government
project ( therefore not all US govt = bad ).</p>

<p>Fuckin' file system at work pisses me off.</p>

<p>It rained today; there's apparently a typhoon coming.  OH, and we
had an awesome earthquake today!  It was the biggest I've ever felt.
totally hardcore awesome.  I've been feeling little earthquakes all
day yesterday and all day today.  Little tiny ones that make me think
"did I imagine that?"  Today I felt a little one again (while in the
break room) and was all, 'earthquake!' and then jiggajiggajiggajigga
the floor started shaking quite effectively.  It ruled.</p>

<p>Also, It sounds like I'm going to be doing a kids class.  I told
Steve et. al., "I'm not singin'," and they said, "you don't have to
for Juniors; they're too cool to sing."  Good.</p>

<p>janette is in the early to mid stages of her Woman Within weekend
retreat.  I'm super excited for her and to hear all about her
experience.  I'm really glad that she and Mags are hitting it off
well.  janette will chill with Maggie for a couple days after the
weekend until the graduation thingy.  It would be quite interesting if
janette sells Maggie on the idea of attending.  I could really see
Maggie doing it as she's been doing a lot of personal growth stuff in
the last couple years.</p>

<p>I have memorized the first four lines of my speech!  That's about
20%, by my estimation.</p>

<p>Yesterday at Starbucks, I recorded Ayana reading my speech and
recorded most of the banter of my trying to slog through it.  The
recording has helped a lot.</p>

<p class=date>11:29am</p>

<p>I'm beginning to memorize the fifth line. It's rather long.   Gotta
get ready for work.</p>

<p>Woah.</p>

<p>I've not tried it, but of course I've considered it.  Mostly I
don't think my granny bike could handle it.  There's a flight of about
10 steps, maybe 5 feet tall, that connects a back alley with the
higher grade (elevation moreso than quality) street near the bridge in
Tsunashima.  On each side of the steps is a smooth steep ramp for
bicycles to be pushed up or reigned down.</p>

<p>Today I was zoomin' behind a guy on a granny bike, mostly keeping
up with him through the people clogs (clumps, not shoes) on the
bridge.  After the bridge, he zipped over to the street and I was
like, "awright!" cause I've never seen another Japanese cat do that.
But then he immediately got back onto the sidewalk instead of taking
the street all the way to the light and I was like, "aw man what a
"but I was cut short when he cut across the sidewalk and vanished down
those steps!  "WOW!"</p>

<p>I wonder if his spokes are tougher than my spokes.  I wonder if
he's in enough control slash can see enough to not annihilate someone
planning to slash already using the ramp as he plans to engage it.</p>

<p>I look greatly forward to having my bike!</p>

<p>Do you think it would be easy enough to send an email with a .jpg
attachment to a super secret email address
super-secret_jpg-processor@robnugen.com and have a perl script that
extracts the .jpg, makes a thumbnail, saves the original and thumbnail
to a directory on my server, and sends a URL reply indicating where
the files are and how much space is left on my account?</p>

<p>That would rule.  Fuckin' hell; I know it's possible.  I wonder how
long it would take me..... oooooooo and for the email reply to tell me
how much space is left on my account.  Sweet.</p>

<p>I'd pay 5000 yen for perl/.procmail code that does it.</p>

<p>Bought batteries on the way to work so that I could have someone
read my speech so I can listen to it tonight.  Yoshie was leaving Nova
as I got off the elevator; I shoulda gotten on with her and had her
read it, but I balked and didn't (there was another student, which
made me uncomfortable with overt fraternizing).  During the day I got
Kaori's phone number and texted her to say I wanted help after Nova if
she happened to be available.  She didn't write back nor show up to
voice.</p>
