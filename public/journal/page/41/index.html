<p>Now at JB wondering why I am watching this incremental game
(<a href="https://clickingbad.nullism.com/">Clicking Bad</a>)instead of doing work
on AB.  In the game, I have 500M units of product, so I am thinking
about adding a whole new component to the game of buying warehouses,
which would be needed to keep up with the inventory else it could be
stolen, and perhaps increase the threat of raids.</p>

<p>Went to SOGO with everyone and then Cookie Time with Aki, but the line
was too long for her so we bounced. Said bye to her at the station and
then went back for cookies!  Bought a shake, but it was more like
blended milk than blended ice cream.  Bought a lemon cookie for Lin
and headed home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh I forgot my water bottle&rdquo; so I headed back to the park and saw
Menya and them leaving the park.  They had my water bottle yay!</p>

<p>Went to lunch at TGIF and ate chicken quesadilla (fast service this
time) across from Ami, next to whom I sat last time we were there (my
first time at SOGO, circa two years ago).  (I had been across from
Emi, but Lisa came and sat by Menya so we all shoved down one seat.)</p>

<p>Headed home and found Lin at the station where we bought KFC and ate
it outside in the yard while mosquitoes feasted as well.</p>

<p>Now sleepy nap time for me before lesson with Sarumama at 8pm and then meeting with
Tariq at 10pm.</p>

<p>Tonight I won the best (of three) English table topics.  Zero ums
counted by the um-counter, and 1 apparent use of the word &ldquo;marvelous&rdquo;
which I actually used as &ldquo;marvel us&rdquo;</p>

<p>The speech topic was anything, based on an item taken from a bag.  I
took out a piece of chocolate so did a sales pitch on it, basically
saying how its dimensions and mass could be used a measurment units.</p>

<p>よいしょ is the audio I want to add right at the end of this video.
In this case, it is the equivalent of &ldquo;3. 2. 1. lift!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Spoonhead is adept at getting the marbles onto the stage because he&rsquo;s
the right height for that.  I gave him long arms as well to help lift
marbles (and knock the switch around accidentally).</p>

</div>


<p>Speaking of accidents, while trying to film the frame after they
lifted the marble, it fell and knocked everything askew.</p>

<p>(written 21:42 Wednesday 13 June 2018 JST)</p>

<p>This past weekend after SOGO (only like 12 people attended because it
was sprinkling for part of the time) we went to Cookie Time, and oh my
god I can imagine how bad it is for me because of how good they
taste.  I will probably go back next week, esp if Aki comes to SOGO;
she also loves sweets.</p>

<p>I ate mine before most people even started theirs; I hadn&rsquo;t heard we
were going to wait for a compai and picture haha.  Some people could
not finish theirs so I helped them out.  Man I must be a sugar junkie.</p>

<p>Hung out in the park afterward, chatting and drawing designs in the
pine needles.  Ended up leaving after a solid hour because the rain
began in earnest.  Walked back to Cookie Time to get my umbrella,
which was helpful to have once I got back to Shin Yurigaoka.</p>
