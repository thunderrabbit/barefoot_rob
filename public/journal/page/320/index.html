<p>No fruit on the perl tree, but as of tonight, I'm published on
rcdb.com!  I took the 3rd and 4th pics for <a
href="https://www.rcdb.com/installationgallery1193.htm">Hamu-Hamu
Ouku</a>.</p>

<p>After the quick response by Duane of rcdb, I sent him a couple more
pics (of Fujiyama) and have decided to zoom to Yomiuriland on
Wednesday to check out <a
href="https://www.rcdb.com/installationgallery1218.htm?Picture=1">Bandit</a>,
which appears to be a pretty rockin' coaster!</p>

<p>I'll take some super high quality pics of stuff there and will be
able to use that in my book.  Sweet!</p>

<p>Okay. bed bed bedtime.</p>

<p>Got to be up in not so long to attend Japanese class.</p>

<p>I have 1013 yen to last through tomorrow.</p>

<p>There is a point inside my head from which thoughts originate.
Different than my ego's thoughts.</p>

<p>I have considered this point my connection with my angels, my inner
voice.. my true guidance.</p>

<p>This voice gives me the answers almost before the questions are
generated.  Like the thought form is formed, but before it is even
translated into English, the answer comes and *the answer* can be
translated before the question is translated.</p>

<p>Almost feels like I can see the thoughts come into my mind.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>It seems to have been a year since I've connected with this voice.
I am thankful for its guidance.</p>

<br>so&mdash; what did it say? we who love you want  to know what he whom we love has to say to said love.<br>
  seriously, did you get some guidance in answer to your angst-driven query(what am i supposed to be doing?)?<br>
  i am curious.  what has kept you from connecting with this voice for a year?<br>
  i am glad for you that you have access to your Self.  that you have the ears to hear.<br>
   your journal entries seem to be building(there are more frequent references to your feelings of restlessness and confusion) to&hellip;.an eruption? explosion?small quiet answer? decisive action?<br>
   i had forgotten that your seminal want was to be a tour guide.  dude!  that&rsquo;s a great idea.  still.  isn&rsquo;t it?   you could get paid to travel with young people.  what&rsquo;s wrong with sticking to that plan?  i know you know how to get around, prepare,take charge.<br>
  as for mkp, what if you gave yourself one year to decide on the wisdom of that?  would that take the pressure off?  maybe something less gargantuan, yet as beneficial to you and the world, will present itself. <br>
  please forgive me if i am speaking out of turn. (whose turn was it ,anyway?)</p>

<p>I'm at KQ today.  Texted Morag to see if she wants to hang on
Tuesday.</p>

<p>Tony yesterday and I today leveled up Kyoko from 6 to 5.  I think
she'll do well on the test.  She'll be fine in 5; she just needs to
speak up in group lessons.</p>

<p>Ooh she just finished; I'll grade it now.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>98% correct.  The one she missed was correct at first, but she
changed her first answer.  There was another first answer that she
erased and changed to correct, though.</p>

<p>I just wrote to sFord and g to see if they can help clarify how I
might organize perl libraries that I'm installing on my local
userspace on webquarry.  I will subsequently wonder about upgrading to
new versions of software..  Oh and that makes me notice an interesting
thing; I have some libraries installed in my web cgi-local directory
that don't need to be there.  They aren't accessed via http; only
smtp.</p>

<p>I wonder if I can move them without breaking anything.</p>

<p>On the way out of work, I said bye to Junko.  She was like, "why
did you shave your head?" and reached up to fuzz it.</p>

<p>I was like, "cause it's easy to take care of.  You should shave you
head too.  It would look cool."</p>

<p>"My?" pointing to herself.</p>

<p>"Hai.  We can just buzz it right off tomorrow.  I'll bring my clippers."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Then I can't catch the boyfriend."</p>

<p>"Mmmm.  Okay. <em>I'll</em> be your boyfriend if you shave your head."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Yes.   Okay, if you shave your head I'll be your boyfriend until
it grows out and then we can break up.  It will be great."</p>

<p>" ... "</p>

<p>"See you tomorrow."</p>

<p>Blah</p>

<p>Trying to figure out how to extract images from email messages
automagically on my server so I can basically email them up there
instead of copying them.  Maybe it's a doomed endeavor.  I can't
really remember the line of thought that said it would solve all my
woes of too few images on my site.  oh wait; I kindof do.</p>

<p>Bah.</p>

<p>It's after midnight.  I'm going to bed.  If I remember (and wake up
early enough) I'll ride my bike to work tomorrow.  Oh, but that means
I'll need to find a something to lock it to.  Hmmm.</p>

<p>But, it would certainly be 10 zillion times easier to just be.</p>

<p>Easier?  Why does it vex me so?</p>

<p>Instead of bringing the mkp to Japan, I could just play video games
and travel around and just kickit in Japan.   Oh why am I here?</p>

<p class=dream>Flying between two sections of island over water.  Awe
inspiring view as I made it over the craggly black silouhette of rocks
and trees of the middle mountain ridge thing.  My dad was there to
support me getting across the water of the final section.  I was
flying slowly, not like superman or a jet, but like a cessna.  This
final section of water kept drawing me down and I couldn't stay aloft
over it; ended up in the water before I got to the next bit of land.
Swam to shore.</p>

<p class=dream>Found Amy Leyenberger and her friends having a tea
party in a secluded cave; they wanted to invite just their friends and
it was themed like a pirate movie; she had a purse that had a little
rotating deal that could say 1970 or 1770 or 1970 in a different font
or 1771, or 70 or a skull and crossbones that looked really old.
There was a video of the hours previous that they had been on this
crazy scary amusement park ride that hardly tied them into each seat,
and spun them thousands of feet in the air on this cliff-attached
octopus ride, like The Gunslinger, but not as many swings, and two
person seats and only a single rope loosely tied around their waist
for safety.</p>

<p>Gave 100 yen to Nakayama, the chubby jolly monk who stands outside
Kawasaki station many days a week.</p>

<p>I might start giving him 100 yen every day I see him.</p>

<p>Lesson with Ayana included me vaguely describing mostly in Japanese
my trip with janette to Hiroshima and Kyoto (and oh yeah, Nara, my
favorite of the three) and then talking to her about bringing mkp to
Japan.  She says there is a need for such, but Japanese are taught
that "yeah, we're all sad, why do you have to tell anyone."
basically.</p>

<p>Idea is to contact some counselors in Japan to get some ideas.</p>

<p>Then vocab vocab - learning go straight, turn left/right at the
first/second light/corner, three/four/five cornered figure (not
equilateral), circle, left side of the street, inside, outside.  Whew.
Enough for a week.</p>

<p>Rode the train home with Morag after work.  Chatted with her, got
an overview of her life history.  From Scotland but raised in Canada.
Went back to Scotland for three months to waitress, then home for five
weeks and now out here.</p>

<p>Hung out with Miki in Musashi-Kosugi after that.  With a little bit
of thought, we were able to come up with 40 kanji that I know!  That
includes yama, kawa, 1-10, Sun-Sat, up, down, stop, gate, eye, big,
white, Tsunashima, Kawasaki, tree, wood, forest, person, left, right.
Oh, one more that we didn't think of while there: inside.
Awesome.</p>

<p>Came home, did two loads of laundry, shaved my head.   Bedtime.</p>
