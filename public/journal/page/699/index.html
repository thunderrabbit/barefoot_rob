<p class=date>14 January 1992</p>

<p>I applied for a weekend position at the Kroger on Montrose a few
days ago.  Now it's Tuesday, January 14, 1992.  A guy called today &
asked me to come in for an interview at 4:pm.  It's 3:30pm.  I forgot
his name, though.

<p class=date>Tuesday, January 14, 1992 9:55PM.</p>

<p><p>The Kroger meeting went well.  I&rsquo;ve almost guaranteed got the job.
I shall go to a training session on Sunday.  I met with Christopher.
We talked to probably 20 or 25 minutes.  He also attends UH.  He said
no problem; he will give me 16 hours each weekend, and only weekends.
So that&rsquo;s cool.  Also today, I talked to Bruce &amp; he said I could cut
the lawns around the apartments for $90 per month.  Dude.  so that
means I&rsquo;ll be doing fine financially.  cool.  Let&rsquo;s see: 16 hours *
$4.65/hour = hmmmm I can maybe save $150 per month.  Okay, let&rsquo;s see.</p>

<pre>
Kro  148    Rent 375
StJ  500   Phone  50
Grass 90    Elec  15
             gas  10
          cargas  20
            food 100
--------         ---
     738  -      570 = $168
</pre>

<p><p>Dude.  I can deal with this.  so if my numbers do work out as I
planned, I&rsquo;ll be doing ok.  Not fantastic, but ok.  Enough to keep
myself entertained.</p>

<p><p>Also today, Pierre &amp; Heather came home.  We went out to Chili&rsquo;s.
After that, we went to their apartment, where they showed me tour
stuff, and Heather told me all about everything.  I really enjoyed it.
At one point, Heather asked how Tammy &amp; I are doing.  So, I told her.
I got kinda shakey for some reason, and short of breath.  I told
Heather that I was shakey, and she hugged me.  I really enjoyed the
hug.  She said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a good guy, Rob.&rdquo;  Oh how I appreciated that.
We talked about implications and stuff, and she was shocked &amp; a bit
sad.  I&rsquo;m glad I told her, though.</p>

<p><p>ALRIGHT!!!  Excellent!  Dad came over and we finished pulling the
carburetor apart.  We then rebuilt it and put it back in the van.
PRESTO!! It worked perfectly!  We are BAD.  It cost us about $10.99 +
10 dollars worth of carburetor cleaner.  My best price otherwise was
$100.  Dude.  They wanted to charge me 100 bucks HA!  I am a stud
mechanic now.</p>

<p><p>AND I was playing Blockout today.  My favorite level is 3X3X18
deep, Basic set.  (That has the following pieces)</p>

<pre>
         imagine ascii image of 3D block shapes
</pre>

<p><p>I normally start on level 4 and I got a high score of 64000 on
12-27-91 or so.  Today I started on level 6 and got to a score of
71000 or so and I had the whole grid basically clear while on level 9,
the top level.  Dude.  I was doing excellent.  Then it went up
<em>another</em> level.  I looked at the level indicator expecting to
see &ldquo;10&rdquo; I was surprised that there was a level 10, since the level
indicator only has 1 digit.  Check this out.  It showed a skull &amp;
crossbones!  Dude!  I was majorly impressed.  So I got the highest
score, the ultra highest level, my carburetor fixed and I am BAD.
later</p>

<p><p>I did not make the sperm donor society.  The doctor said my
family&rsquo;s genetic history was not cool enough.  Shit.  so I was in a
bad mood for a while after that.  Tammy and I had a relatively
important discussion about finances and our future and whether or not
we&rsquo;ll allow eachother to fuck and suck other people.  We decided we
would be a great couple if we didn&rsquo;t live together.</p>

<p><p>The carburetor is still in pieces here.  Dad is coming over
tomorrow to help me work on it.  Later</p>

<p><p>The van needs to have the carburetor rebuilt.  That&rsquo;s what the
Downtown Auto Care Center says.  They are the one&rsquo;s who replaced my
timing chain on the van.  Dad doesn&rsquo;t think they know what&rsquo;s wrong and
that I&rsquo;m getting the run-around.  Sigh - I wish everyone was
trustworthy.</p>

<p><p>I made my appointment for my first Sperm donation for Monday the
6th.  If I don&rsquo;t cum before then, it will be almost exactly 100 hours
of sexual abstinence for me.  Dude.  Well, check you later</p>

<p class=date>8:PM Thursday January 2nd 1992</p>

<p><p>I am back at home now.  A lot happened at the beach house.  I was
most pleased with my outgoingness and the fact that I <b>learned</b>
every single name there.  Some cool things that I want to remember:</p>

<p><p><li>Mike had a HUGE jam box.  It truthfully reminded me of a space
craft.</p>

<p><p><li>Danny gave us $70 to purchase fireworks.  We went to the stand
and just kept on getting stuff.  &ldquo;How much is it now?&rdquo; we would ask.
&ldquo;$40&rdquo; &ldquo;Ok.  let&rsquo;s get some more&rdquo; At the end our total was $71.30.  The
girl said, &ldquo;The total is 71.30.&rdquo;  I said, &ldquo;Shoot - we&rsquo;ve only got 70
dollars.&rdquo;  She said, &ldquo;well, that&rsquo;s okay.. I&rsquo;ll cover the
dollar-thirty.&rdquo;  Cool.  There was also a dog named Chopper there.  So
in the &ldquo;Special thanks go to&rdquo; section of the Smelg album, we&rsquo;ll put
&ldquo;Special thanks to Chopper, and the chick who spotted us a
dollar-thirty on a seventy dollar purchase of explosives.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p><li>The ground between the beach and house was loaded with cockle
burrs.  The first couple of times that I went across, I wore shoes.
Then I walked barefoot across them.  The last several times, though, I
would yell &ldquo;Yaaaaagghhhh!!&rdquo; and <b>run</b> across them at top speed.
It was so hilarious when I&rsquo;d hear behind me, &ldquo;Wait, Rob, ther&rsquo;s
cockleburrs there!&rdquo; I would yell back, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Ok!!&rdquo; and continue
running.  Each time I did that, I&rsquo;d end up with about 10 of them in my
feet.</p>

<p><p><li>The last day, Mike, Bryan (Devin&rsquo;s brother) and I played
frisbee for a whle and then played tag with the two young cousins of
Devin &amp; Bryan, Adam &amp; Genie.  I drew a 20 by 20 foot boundary and we
played freeze tag for a while.  Then the grils got back from walking
and played as well.  That was so fun.  After that, we dug a sand
castle.  It was mostly Sarah and I who did it.  We dug a hole in the
center and built walls around it and then used the water for drippy
sand structures around the whole wall.  It was very nice.</p>

<p><p>We watched some Tiny Toons, I had never seen them before, but I can
see why Maggie has 8 or 16 hours worth of Tiny Toons recorded.  At the
end it was almost Rally quality goodbyes &amp; stuff.  We all had a
fantastic time and vowed to do it again.</p>

<p><p>We stopped at Adam&rsquo;s house and I got to meet his lovely sister,
Wendy.  She had her hair slicked back with conditioner.  It looked so
good.  We played on Adam&rsquo;s computers and he gave me a copy of
Lemmings.  I was invited to spend the night there, but I wanted to see
Tammy, so I had them bring me home.</p>

music.  Looking out the window, I see the sky is entirely gray.  The
ocean is about 150 or 200 yards away (wrong 50 yards only)

<p class=date>It's now 11AM or so.</p>

<p><p>I went to the beach and got some cool shells.  I met Danny &amp;
Phyllis, Devin&rsquo;s parents.  They are really cool.  I walked around with
Danny for a while before anyone else was up.  There&rsquo;s a field next
door to the house with cattle in it.  Pretty interesting.  Right now
we&rsquo;re listening to music: <em>Ned&rsquo;s Atomic Dustbin</em>. Cool group
name, eh?</p>

<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)</p>

<p>I'm working on my new sleep schedule.  I have to be at work at 9AM.
Tammy and I had great sex at about 11PM last night.  I slept until
1:30AM, when I woke up & took a shower.  I'm kinda groggy right now,
but we'll see how it goes.  I intend to sleep at 4AM until 6:30AM when
Tammy wakes up.  Then I'll take a short nap at 8AM.  Then work & take
a nap during lunch.  We'll see how it goes.

<p class=date>3:50AM</p>

<p>I've been writing to Maggie & Molly.  I'm about to go to sleep now.  Let me just put all this stuff away.

<p class=date>7:50PM</p>

<p>Well, it didn't quite work out.  I was unable to make myself get up at 6:30AM with Tammy.  I snoozed until 8AM..  Right now, Caleb & Devin are at Adam's beach house.  I called them, and apparently Adam & family aren't out there, yet.  I called Adam's house & asked if he'd call me back before he goes out.  He might pick me up on the way out there.  That would be really cool, since I'd enjoy going.  So I'm writing this & to Maggie & Molly waiting for his possible call.

<p class=date>10PM</p>

<p>He just called and said no prob to picking me up.  However, he said
it will be late.  So - who knows when... I finished Maggie's & Molly's
letters.  I sent them each a personal one, and then a combined letter
that I turned into a jigsaw puzzle & split the pieces into each
envelope.  That should be fun for them.  I just now payed the rent,
and I've got about $200 in my account.  Not amazing, but at least I
didn't have to write it in red ink.  Later.

<p class=date>11:45</p>

<p><p>Tammy just got home &amp; I told her.  I&rsquo;m outside waiting for Adam.</p>

<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)</p>

<p><p>I was beaten soundly by Mr Bandecca 4 or 5 games in a row.  I kinda
felt bad, since he had commented about how he wanted a workout, not to
just piss around..  He was very nice about it, and I believe sincere
when he said he enjoyed playing.  That&rsquo;s cool.</p>

<p><p>Last night I got a call from Cheri, who said she was going out with
some guy who&rsquo;s 31, apparently a real charmer, he&rsquo;s made comments about
her nice blonde hair &amp; &ldquo;good proportions&rdquo; and commented that he&rsquo;d like
to take pictures of her.  Shit.  I told her absolutely NOT to go out
with him.  I begged her.  I told her that if she stood him up, I would
come out there &ldquo;right now&rdquo; and take her out wherever she wanted to go.
My pleading didn&rsquo;t work, so I told her at least to call me when she
got back.  She agreed to that, and she did call me back.  I was quite
glad to hear that she was OK.  I was pretty snoozy when we talked, but
I remember that she went to his apartment, but he didn&rsquo;t make any
moves on her.  I told her how much I care about her and that I was so
glad that she survived.</p>

<p><p>This morning when I got up, I noted that someone cracked my lower
right office windows.  - I guess that&rsquo;s my office&rsquo;s lower right
window.  Anyway, it looks like a rock hit it or a b-b gun.  Stupid ass
people.</p>

<p><p>Today, I did the laundry and worked on Laura&rsquo;s letter.  The written
portion of it is finished - I simply need to put in my letter inserts.
I&rsquo;m giving her several 1969 pennies, but I need to tape them to a
sheet so that they won&rsquo;t bunch up in a corner.  We have no scotch
tape, though.  I finished up her letter with the words to <em>Now</em>
by Edie Brickel &amp; New Bohemians.  Then I wrote &ldquo;that about sums it up.
I miss you.  Much Love - Rob&rdquo; I hope she likes it.  What am I
saying?!? of course she&rsquo;ll like it.  On to a new subject&hellip;</p>

<p><p>Tammy got her hair sliced while she was gone.  She got a huge make
up kit, too.  She was acting a lot like her mom when she got back.  So
far today she has spent about (1) one minute interacting with me since
we got back from the airport.  It&rsquo;s weird having her back; all her
stuff is all over the place, she&rsquo;s spent 3 hours on the computer and
about 2 on the phone.  Heh- I guess she won&rsquo;t mind if I got fuck
whoever I want.  Maybe Anne Meek from the ER at work.  Ann(e)(?) is a
tall big girl, 21 years old, big smile with braces, great eyes, long
brown hair.  Mmmm.  I will definitely interact with her once I&rsquo;m free
of Tammy.</p>

<p><p>Oh, one other cool thing.  While Tammy was gone, I kinda worked on
the Buckminster Fuller sleep schedule.  Awake 3.5 hours, sleep .5
hours over and over.  I believe that I did it once.  No great feat
really, but I had been awake a few hours, then I lay in bed &amp; dosed
for a bit (never actually fell into deep sleep) and then woke up
refreshed.  Now that I think about it, it seems like no big deal, less
than that even.  Oh well.  Sometime I will work to keep that schedule
up for a long while.  It&rsquo;s just hard to do it in today&rsquo;s society.  I
guess if I really planned it out, I could do it for a little while.
Something like&hellip;  Dude!  The pharmacy is about to close on
Saturdays.. I could do it Let me get my school schedule.  Hang on.  Ok
- I have requested that I work on Mon, Wed &amp; Fri from about 2 to 9:30.</p>

<p><p>HOLY MOLY.  That would work!  And so easily, too!  The only tough
part would be getting ready for work and napping between school on
Mon, Wed, &amp; Fri.  I would simply have to bring my work clothes to
school.  Oh my gosh - the implications of pulling this off would be
fantastic!  If I pull this off, it&rsquo;s 3 hours of sleep per day.  Just
think what I could do with all that extra time!!! Will it work?  We
shall see.  I would need to get some sort of timer that I would set.
Hmmm.  This would be great.  If necessary, I could catch up on the
weekends.  Whoah ..</p>

<p><p>This schedule does assume that I can get my &lsquo;job&rsquo; donating sperm.
I would have 20 hours per week at St. Joseph, and and extra $200 per
month from sperm donation.  More than enough to cover everything.  If
I can&rsquo;t get the sperm job, I&rsquo;ll have to get a weekend job.  We shall
see within a few weeks.  Later</p>
