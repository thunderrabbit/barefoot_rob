<p>No foolin' it's been a week that I've not had my computer online.
Hopefully soon I'll get that rectified.</p>

<p>I had dreams last night including a scene where we were all in a
room for a class of some sort and Michael Jackson (the new Michael
Jackson) was outside the window and people were taunting him.  I was
like, "hey, listen.  That cat worked his ass off and made a million
jillion kazillion dollars.  Just because he's changed doesn't mean
it's appropriate to gawk at him and treat him like an animal." or
something like that.</p>

<p>Most recent dream included Tammy and Christie from my late high
school days as we were remembering all the good times and fun games we
had played like The Seven Game and Silent Football.  (in 'reality' we
did play the seven game, but not SF)</p>

<p>So I have a few hours off from work this morning to clean my room
that's still not perfectly organized, and has actually gotten a little
bit fucked up with all my Nova shit dumped everywhere on the floor as
I'm sorting through it all.  Part of it I want to archive in a scrap
book which I don't have yet, and part of it I might need for future
reference, and part of it is just trash to be chunked.  Er,
recycled.</p>

<p>First day was fine.  Little bit long at the end.  We worked until
just after 9pm.  Each new teacher (four of us) led parts of one class:
the introduction "hi; what's yer name" and... shit I just realized I
didn't do the homework we were given to do tonight.  watched a movie
instead about Michael Douglas chasing some young Japanese Yazuka
mobster-wanna-be around Japan.</p>

<p>Anyway, we led the first and last part of the lesson, which my
trainer said are the hardest parts.</p>

<p>While in training, I had a flash of when I was at KTRU being
trained as a DJ by Alexis.  How I was all nervous but kept a good
attitude and tried to keep myself calm and cool like a cool
cucumber.</p>

<p>That flash gave me solace.  I know I can do this.  I've been
nervous at new jobs before.  This is cake.</p>

<p>Gotta sleep to get up and have more cake tomorrow.</p>

<p>Oh:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We ate at a sushi train today.  (Little conveyor belt of plates
of sushis go by and we eat whatever we want, stack up the plates and
get charged by the resulting stack of plates.)  Salita is also from OZ
(Melbourne) but she "eats only chicken," so it was a stretch for her
to eat sushi.  I had a hard time understanding why she would come here
to Japan, plus here to a sushi bar.</p></li>

<li><p>Olivia is from OZ (Adelade (sp)) and lives in the same building
as I.</p></li>

<li><p>We rode the train back together after Steve helped us get our
train passes good for a month.</p></li>

<li><p>She has a boyfriend type person, far as I can tell.  She's off
the list cause she's as young as some of my ex-youth.</p></li>

<li><p>It takes about 45 minutes on the 2 trains to get to work.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Good night.</p>

<br>Rob!!! You inconceivable bastard!<br>
<br>
So the other day I decided that it would be really fucking great to instead of going back to school and spending even more money on classes to learn languages, just go to other countries and learn them for free!<br>
<br>
and theeeeeeen i was talking with this girl at work and she was like, &ldquo;yeah, my friend went to japan and they actually PAID her to do it!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
And guess who it was with, rob, can you guess? because bastards can always guess.<br>
<br>
So, now it seems like you are officially my life role model. I am glad you are having fun, and now i need to bug you alot more than my crummy website ever needed to set my short term goals for my life. I&rsquo;m really happy and proud of you, man.<br>
<br>
Now it&rsquo;s my turn to be the watcher in awe.<br>

<p>I just talked to Janette and it was great!!  18 minutes of
yammering about everything we've done in the past week on a Brastel
phone card given to me by Nova.  Good job, Brastel, you got my
business.</p>

<p>Best news from the Dallas front is Janette's space in Austin is
selling like yummy hotcakes!  The yellow table, the something else and
that other thing are all sold, plus tons of other stuff.  Excellent!
I'm so excited for her for that!</p>

<p>Gave her the lowdown on the haps in Japan, that I still basically
can't read anything, but that it's slowly coming together every
day.</p>

<p>Told her about Eminem and Beastie Boys concerts coming soon to a
country near me!</p>

<p>That final minute on the phone card went by like ziiiinngg!</p>

<p>My room is somewhat clean-ish now.  I've thrown a lot of stuff away
and have to get creative on how I'll store items.  The challenge is
not so much lack of room, but lack of shelving.  I don't think there
are Container Stores in Japan.</p>

<p class=dream>Riding around with Ryan McCarthy in his little car, we
were reminiscing about old times living and playing at the Bibby's
house.  About making toy paper B-52 bombers of various sizes, and
sometimes making two in a row cause all we had was time to do anything
we wanted.  "Oh and remember that one where we added all the extra
plastic and gum and shit on it?  It was so loaded down it was huge -
it could fly about this fast" I showed him by moving my hand as
through molasses.  "Yeah it was like a Logan" and I'm like "???  She
was not a big girl. She was tall but not big."</p>

<p class=dream>And we were way up in this telephone pole type thing
after having parked near a favorite food store of his.  Some stools
were slightly in the way in the street below us, like little 1 foot
tall bar stools.  We were yammering and laughing and a car below was
all wanting to get through, and had plenty of room, but was being all
cautious and stuff.  We waved this person on through and she got
through but the next car was just as slow and finally made it through.
The next car with an asian woman driving and her asian friend and two
poodles in the car was driving quite aggressively right on the bumper
of the second car and when the second car got through the asian driver
started knocking over the stools like in a pissed off manner, then
turned into the parking lot and ripped around the circle and back to
the stools and crashed through more of them more aggressively this
time.  She parked all askew in front of someone's house and got out
all normal like, "will our car be okay there?"</p>

<p class=dream>It was Catherine Nguyen, but she didn't recognize
me.</p>

<p class=dream>"Um, we don't own that property; we can't give you
permission to park there."</p>

<p class=dream>"Well where did you park?"</p>

<p class=dream>We told her and then she looked snootily over at the
idea of moving her car somewhere.</p>

<p class=dream>"But you'll watch it won't you?"</p>

<p class=dream>"We're just about to leave, but good luck."</p>

<p class=dream>"You know what, fuck 'em," referring to the owner of
the property in front of which she had parked.</p>

<p class=dream>"Yeah, that's just like what the Russians said," said
Ryan, making some political reference that I didn't get.</p>

<p class=dream>She got it and laughed, "Oh haha I bet you're a real
jerk."</p>

<p class=dream>"I'm as good as they come," he retorted.</p>

<p class=dream>And I'm thinking '<em>dammn how can they practically
seem to like each other by being so viscious?<em>' but I knew it was
all somehow a game they were playing.</p>

<p class=dream>She and her friend walked away and Ryan and I climbed
down to make good on our promise to leave and not watch her car.  I
kept thinking to myself, "man that girl is hot."</p>

<p class=dream>Then I was like, "oh shit I wonder if I'm late?" and we
checked the clock which kept calculating the time like a scale when
someone first steps on it and the wheel goes back and forth as it
centers on the weight.  It never got past 8pm.  So I figured I was
okay, but then I slowly realized I was dreaming and Matty would have
woken me up anyway.  Whew.</p>

<p>Looks like I'll be a bit late for orientation.  But Frank said his
didn't start until 35 minutes after the specified time.  Matty said
his did start on time.</p>

<p>Both of them indicated that Nova peeps would be quite forgiving on
this first official adventure on the rail system, so I'm not too
worried.  Next stop is mine.  Well, next stop is where I transfer to a
new train for 7 minute ride, then 10 minute walk to get to the

<p>You know those little fresh breath strips that melt on the tongue?
Well I pulled out my little pack and found that all the remaining
strips were fused together.  It had been nearly full.</p>

<p>Meh.</p>

<p>I popped them all in my mouth.</p>

<p>WHooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!  Now that's
<em>hot!</em></p>

<p>I'm in orientation now; we're filling out lotsa paperwork and stuff
on Japanese forms, with careful instructions including a new way to
calculate our birthdates.  My Japanese birthday is year 45 of the
previous emporer's reign, March 25.  Of course if I knew the name of
the previous emporer, then I'd say his name.  1/2 penance point for
me.</p>

<p>Tiiiiired.</p>

<p>Janelle looks a lot like woman from Something about Mary.   DAmn
that's how tired I am; I can't think of her name.</p>

<p>We got phones after work.  I have a phone now.  I don't have the
number memorized, and it's way across the room so I'm not going to get
it now.</p>

<p>The phone has a camera on it and so many features that I couldn't
even figure out how to save names on it, nor even how to make a phone
call!  Now I know why Frank was all, "I just want one fuckin' feature
on my phone: <b>ring</b>."</p>

<p>Frank helped me save names on it.</p>

<p>Got home, Matty, Frank and I went to Miho's restaurant.  Miho is
the name of a waitress who speaks pretty good English, has a great
smile, and is quite friendly.  I don't know the actual name of the
restaurant, but they just call it Miho's cause of her.  We got a pile
of food for 1600 yen each.  Frank could tell all the different types;
I'm too tried to fuck with it now.</p>

<p>I'm to work for the next year in Kawasaki, about a 30 minute train
ride from where we live.  It's apparently a red light district, so
maybe I can soon confirm the existence of vending machines with used
girls' panties for sale.  I wonder how a red light district might
affect my addiction.</p>

<p>We stopped by DVD/CD rental place and they're watching a DVD now.
I fell flat fucking asleep on my bed in my clothes until Frank
hollered at me to see if I want to watch the movie with them.</p>

<p>Cameron Diaz!</p>
