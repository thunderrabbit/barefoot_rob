<p><a href="https://www.oregon.gov/olcc/marijuana/pages/default.aspx">Recreational marijuana is legal in Oregon.</a>
I took advantage of this fact last night and had a really overall
positive experience with several <em>experiencial</em> teachings I gained.</p>

<p>I am still a bit affected as I write this, sitting in the airport in
Portland, waiting for my flight back to Narita.</p>

<p>The most interesting aspect about the experience itself was the time
stretching.  For a few chrono minutes, I experienced one timeline in
reverse and another forward.  In the reverse timeline, it was like
causality was reversed.  I got out an umbrella so it started raining.
I had created the ampersand symbol so that I could try to &amp;help
myself out of this situation now. But that doesn&rsquo;t make sense because
if I did that, then I would have had to create computers, which would
mean I had to create electricity, therefore earth, therefore the
galaxy, all the way back to creating time.</p>

<p>I That was the bad part of trip; I was experiencing each choice I made
as the <em>wrong</em> choice, leading myself to having fallen into this
infinitely recursive spiraling infinity of loss, which happened at
every moment going forward, during which each moment had me
experiencing fear all the way from the beginning of time like watching
a car wreck in slow motion after having already lived it.  Each time
they went all the way back to the beginning of the universe in which I
created heaven and hell <em>so that</em> I could have the experience right
<em>now</em> of saying &ldquo;yes, you were right&rdquo; to the devil, &ldquo;you (Devil) <em>can</em>
do anything you want (including run time two directions at one), and
hell <em>is</em> real.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The backwards timeline was both infinite and infinitesimal, with
infinities available at any given point, like focusing in at the numbers
in a number line.</p>

<pre><code>0  1
0  0.5   1
0  0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1
0  0.001 0.002 0.003 0.004 0.005 0.006 0.007 0.008 0.009 1
0  0.000001 0.000002 0.000003 0.000004 0.000005 0.000006 ...
</code></pre>

<p>My host became the devil and was smiling at me as he had trapped me.
Every decision I made including having come to this place was a trap
of his design.  I realized if every choice I made was the wrong
choice, I might as well do something good for something while I am at
it, so I started to pet Radar, my host&rsquo;s dog who gave me some kisses.
I kept petting Radar and the backwards timeline had less sway in my
thinking and that began to let me focus on the forward moving
&ldquo;correct&rdquo; timeline.</p>

<p>In that moment, I recognized that by focusing on fear (and feeling
sorry for myself) I went further into the reverse timeline where
everything was my fault, all leading to the ultimate stuck alone in
hell experience, repeatedly experiencing all-my-choices-are-wrong and
I-cannot-make-the-correct-choice.</p>

<p>So with that realization, I got my first experiencial <em>knowing</em>:</p>

<h3 id="1-focusing-on-loving-others-brings-me-out-of-pain">1) focusing on loving others brings me out of pain.</h3>

<p>My host led me to the guest bedroom by way of the restroom to brush my
teeth.  I was able to floss, but not brush.  I remember asking if I
had already brushed as I couldn&rsquo;t remember if I had.  I lay down on
the couch bed and started texting Jimmy, replying to his question from
a few days ago.  The convo below is paraphrased.  J is for Jimmy and
私 marks things I wrote:</p>

<h2 id="march-8th">March 8th</h2>

<p>J:  &ldquo;How was Portland?&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="my-first-reply-mon-10pm">My first reply Mon 10pm:</h2>

<p>私: I am high as fuck</p>

<h2 id="22-22">22:22</h2>

<p>私: It&rsquo;s 22:22 now and I had crazy time dialation like rooms and centuries gone backward</p>

<p>Sorry have a good night</p>

<p>I am super high and time is going both backwards and forwards</p>

<p>With the devil on the forward side offering me good while he offered me bad with each reversing as I paid attention to the other timeline</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s 22:25 and that took a small lifetime</p>

<h2 id="01-14">01:14</h2>

<p>私: Okay I got up and went to the bathroom. 01:14 now. Then I came back
and took shower. I bought the soap from the soap factory I had
established in the 1800s to cause world trade center to be destroyed
so I could meet the guy behind A&#38;E9&#47;11truth. Then I got busy with the
American revolution before the one that started in 1776. And now I am
sitting in the bathroom at 01:17</p>

<p>Or something like that kinda time was the delay before, like two or
three hours ago.</p>

<p>((( me now at 10:10am:   That was what I wrote, trying to capture an idea of the
time dialation experience, and I note I was relatively correct when I
said it was 2 or 3 hours ago.  )))</p>

<h2 id="01-18">01:18</h2>

<p>J: this was your dream? or time warp or whatever?</p>

<p>私: Yes, That was the size of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>10000000</sub> of my dream</p>

<p>J: wild</p>

<p>私: One time was going backwards and one was going forwards. That was
a bad trip for a second, I was stuck in an illogic loop, but then
finally was able to think my way out.</p>

<p>((( me now at 10:15am Portland time Tuesday: What is kinda magnifying
the effect is my computer being set to Japan time (still) and my phone
being set to Portland time, and the chats only showing
<del>Portland</del> <ins>Japan</ins> time
as I write the in Portland time&hellip;  and as I try to figure out what to
write I still wrote the wrong geography for a second. )))</p>

<p>((( me now at 10:19am Portland time: at some point while I was texting
Jimmy, I had the second big realization+knowing, that feelings are
important. )))</p>

<h3 id="feelings-are-important">feelings are important</h3>

<p>Feelings help me distinguish between the right way to move forward and
the way I do not wish to move forward.  I knew this from before, but
this time I (think I) learned it more deeply.</p>

<h2 id="01-25">01:25</h2>

<p>私: And even now while I&rsquo;m typing, it is it while I&rsquo;m awake, that time is slowing down
But the one isn&rsquo;t going backwards anyone
At the long text I wrote two timestamps:</p>

<p>1:14 and 1;17</p>

<p>I felt it coming on (
Those timestamps, I mean, were accurate at the moment I wrote each
one.
) I felt the cold before because I had been outside helping my
(ghost) haha I typed host and my phone thought typed ghost</p>

<p>I had be outside helping my host with s can construction project when
my high hit</p>

<p>We were calculate the &hellip;.. Voice to text now:</p>

<h2 id="01-30">01:30</h2>

<p>私: We were calculating how much to cut a pole on the fence and the gate
because he had made a gate width with a fence posts that was a non
standard width according to the market</p>

<p>I meant to type though not so
Sometimes my phone doesn&rsquo;t respond to my touch and I think it&rsquo;s like normal I just has one of them weird now cuz I&rsquo;m having this experience
So the experience is no longer scary but for a minute it was scary</p>

<p>Because I didn&rsquo;t know how long the Minit was I kept repeating some things that were scary and they were proving the experience was real
I remember talking about water on the screen but not oil
But I had protected the bad trip on my current host and something like he was in on the bad trip as well
Which did the first trip I had just marked up is like my first trip
and who cares that it was bad</p>

<p>But then the district because link to it has a like a logical circumstances both of my house were in on it that really freaked me out for a bit
Because one time stream was going backwards and prove that this trip
number two caused for trip number one to happen</p>

<h2 id="01-33">01:33</h2>

<p>J: yup, youre high</p>

<p>私: And that post number two was therefore in on the same bad trip like he had been planning for it in from reverse and It Forward going through. Time stream
Some of the fucked-up text is because of this phone misinterpreting me
And it&rsquo;s too fiddly to use my finger to correct the text</p>

<h2 id="01-40">01:40</h2>

<p>(((( Here is the beginning of the next realization: ))))</p>

<p>私: My phone doesn&rsquo;t have enough charge to do video</p>

<p>(((( As I was connecting to Jimmy as a source of stability, I saw the
phone battery slowly dying.  I could not work out how to charge it and
was feeling really sad that I would not be able to connect with him
for a few infinities that I would experience between when the phone
died and my trip waned.</p>

<p>And that brought the next realization: change is good.  The fact that
my battery is inexorably heading in one direction (losing energy), it
proved to me that I was experiencing time in the correct direction,
albeit with infinities of interruptions, each infinitely long.  ))))</p>

<h2 id="02-42-tuesday-13-march-2018-jst">(((( 02:42 Tuesday 13 March 2018 JST ))))</h2>

<h2 id="10-42-monday-12-march-2018-portland">(((( 10:42 Monday 12 March 2018 Portland ))))</h2>

<p>In the aiport now, writing this entry for an hour now, I am going to
just slap down some of the other learnings, including the one I just
mentioned above</p>

<h3 id="change-is-good">Change is good</h3>

<h3 id="i-choose-my-focus">I choose my focus</h3>

<h3 id="my-focus-chooses-my-experience">My focus chooses my experience</h3>

<h3 id="i-can-make-the-right-choices">I can make the right choices</h3>

<h3 id="i-have-the-power-to-choose-at-each-and-every-moment">I have the power to choose at each and every moment</h3>

<p>These realizations kept coming more and more quickly, possibly
subjectively quickly, but I think objectively more quickly as well,
stacking up on each other like momentum of goodness.</p>

<p>Okay I am going to try to sleep for a bit.  Still a bit more than an
hour until boarding.</p>

<h2 id="16-04-tuesday-13-march-2018-jst">16:04 Tuesday 13 March 2018 JST</h2>

<p>Back in Tokyo, headed to men&rsquo;s group, all the time dialation effects
are worn off.</p>

<h2 id="16-46-sunday-13-may-2018-jst">16:46 Sunday 13 May 2018 JST</h2>

<p>I just found this, which kinda describes it perfectly</p>

<p>Chillin at airport now in Portland, about to go home.  Sad that I did
not connect with Colleen or anyone else who may be here.</p>

<p>Ecstatic about deep transformational work and experience I had.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s not why I am writing.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s my things to do:</p>

<p>1) copy things to do here
2) add new Complice Goal of Connect with Babychan
3) copy my things to do back onto Complice</p>

<p>Okay so here is step one:</p>

<pre><code>5) get caught up on email
&amp;) process most email
2) brush teeth in morning $wf:r:cdd283568d11
7) write something about my experience $wf:r:6f3d9a1f2ae4
7) write something else
1) day off $wf:r:716d40cb45f8
2) do ten pushups $wf:r:219a438d8f19
2) eat well $wf:r:dec36bfd8499
2) fill in contract regarding food $wf:r:0e1b8532c6b9
8) read something $wf:r:7c12c63d02c2
6) fly back to Japan
6) sleep on plane to get back on Japan sleep schedule
6) go to men's circle
9) go see my babychan
</code></pre>

<h2 id="01-37-tuesday-13-march-2018-jst">01:37 Tuesday 13 March 2018 JST</h2>

<p>Okay step two is done.</p>

<p>And neither step one nor step three was required because Complice
saved my work automatically.</p>

<p>Bunch of great guys here in Oregon for the LT1 and ST1 dual training.
I attended ST1 (Staff Training 1) in Perth last year and am attending
LT1 (Leadership Training 1) in Oregon this weekend.  Got to meet Alan
who I know from my online men&rsquo;s circle, and met Mike P with dredlocks
who I had met online as well.  Also met Richard and was like &ldquo;woah!&rdquo;
when I recognized I knew him from online.  Have not yet seen Scotty K,
who I also know from online, but I told him on Thursday that I&rsquo;d be
here and he said he might come down.</p>

<p>Sad news is that I am an idiot and did <em>not</em> tell Collenie Beanie that
I would be here, and I did not realize until she was like, &ldquo;wait,
which Portland?&rdquo; on FB that I had effed up.  I was so focused on just
the weekend that I did not tell anyone except the men here.  Colleen
said she would have driven down to see me!  Oh god I am such an idiot.
I will be back by next year though, so I will be hella sure to let her
know ahead of time!</p>

<p>Got the blessing of the community tonight before dinner and John H
started to fundraise a bit for me to help start MKP Japan.  He wrote
me a check which covers my flight over here.  Not sure how to cash it
though unless they have my bank in this area.  Talked to John for a
while tonight, and he seems to have a wide range of detailed info
about a wide range of historical, financial, naval, and medical
topics.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m leaving in about an hour for a weekend in Portland.  It&rsquo;s for a
training called <em>The Container of Leadership</em>.  I will be challenged
to look deeply at myself, really digging down into my -isms and other
thoughts which unconsiously underly my perception of the world.</p>

<p>I sketched out this speech a few days ago as I decided to switch my
<a href="https://complice.co/?r=pgej30cphu">Complice</a> Goal 0 from &ldquo;Take Counseling Course Online&rdquo; to &ldquo;Speak on stage
in Tokyo&rdquo;</p>

<pre><code>What is your mission in life?

What is it that drives you, that inspires you to wake up each day,
knowing what you plan to do, knowing it might not work out that
way TODAY, but knowing that on the whole, you are driving toward
something.

I'm not talking about goals daily goals weekly goals 5 year plan
10 year plan. I'm talking about my mission for me it's that
unattainable optimal Target in life that's concrete but elusive.

Maybe concrete is not the right word. It's succinct. it's easy for
me to do a litmus test to determine if any particular action is
assigned with what I ultimately want to be known for in life. Is
this moving me closer toward my target Mission or not?

What is your mission in life?

What do you ultimately want to be known for in life. What do you
want to be on your epitaph?

Yes I mean that message on your head stone when you die. This is
life out death stuff. what will you create with your life?

It's my LinkedIn profile title. Half of my mission is my
title. That gives me some flexibility for how to implement my
mission.

For me it's my kids. I want to raise them into productive adults
who have self driven self created missions in life. And to be
clear, I don't mean my biological children. It's too late for
that. Unless we have a Surprise. I'm ready now, I think. Okay I'm
readiER.

I can remember asking my dad when he would be a granddad. I was
perhaps seven years old. At that time, I didn't know I had
anything to do with that decision.

In any case, my mission is something that is, truthfully,
unattainable.  LIke a shining star on the horizon, pointing me in
the direction I want to have traveled when I look back on my life.

Having a mission gives me some core material to discuss when it's
my turn to speak in men's circle.  I may start by stating my mission:

I create a safe and empowered world by listening and sharing my heart.

Then the simple question guides me.  In what parts of my life do I
not listen nor share my heart?   Oh man, talk about pulling out
the stops!  Well, I sigh, for example &quot;sometimes I do not listen
to my wife.&quot;

And this can start a whole experiential connection to deep
emotions which are, ultimately, keeping me from being on mission.

<p>Today I spent the morning setting up a test image upload page to see why I can&rsquo;t get the main page to work via https.</p>

<p>Frustrating: the test page is working fine.</p>

<p>Working, I  was distracted from online integration group, and then zoned to SCC and found out the manager is leaving soon.</p>

<p>Now in Akihabara about to go to GG lesson.</p>

it&rsquo;s time to get back to work.</p>

<p>I think of it as Liar Bird because it ostensibly can create recordings
of me saying anything. I recorded 30+ sentences using Mr Big voice.
He speaks very slowly and deliberately, sortakinda like an Ent in Lord
of Rings movies.  The results are far less than stellar, but they are
reasonable for a beta, plus only having recorded the minimum number of
sentences.</p>

<pre><code>To pursue his dream of travel, Rob gave up his comfortable life in
Texas, including house, car, cat, and fiance. Just to see what
else is out there.

Fascinated with time, Rob has started a stop-motion animation
project, likely to take ten years.  He has also started writing a
novel, which is being presented backwards, one word at a time.

Walking around barefoot as often as possible, Rob hopes to inspire
others to do what they like, regardless of what other people may
think.

Not knowing what to do in life, Rob often prescribes to Bashar's
suggestion that people should do what excites them most at any
given moment.

At the current ongoing moment, that is organizing peer counseling
circles for men and women in Tokyo.  Growing from 3 men to 9 men
and 4 women in two years.
