<p class=date>Tuesday 31 March 1998</p>

<p>
Today in gymnastics, I did back handsprings again, and my standing ones were better than those I did last week!  (Plus I didn't rip my abs.)
<p>
I did some round off back handsprings, and they got better and better as I kept practicing and then they got crappy.  My arms forgot to land or they were all spread out or whatever.
<p>
Then I did one really good round off back handspring (really good for me) my arms were straight, though I landed in a crouched position of "am I alive? did I do it???"<br>
But it was straight and my arms were straight.
<p>
And then they got crappy again..  I couldn't even tell where my body was and aaaarrggggh!!!  I did some great standing ones, but my round off ones were dumb.
<p>
After class, I talked with Lindsey and her mom.  Lindsey is having the same problem I am: good standing back handsprings, but crappy round off back handsprings.
<p>
They told me about a gym out in Katy that has a much bigger better program than this one.  I may go check it out at 4:30pm this Sunday.</p>

<p class=date>Saturday 28 March 1998</p>
<p>
Yesterday at work I got a new super fast modem for my computer at home.  56k!!!!
<p>
My excitement is fake.  I currently have an ISDN line that work will no longer pay for.  I am slowly being weaned off the internet.. (??)
<p>
I'm using ISDN now.  We'll see if installation of this new modem is as easy as the box says.
<p>
I wonder if I can connect using ISDN and modem at the same time.</p>

                        <p><title>Ring for people named Rob</title></p>

<p class=date>26 March 1998</p>

<p>

Today I decided I should join a ring for people named Rob.
<p>
I checked out <a href=https://www.webring.org>www.webring.org</a>
and I found rings for people named Susan, rings for people named Bob ("not Rob," it said, but Bob), rings for people named such and such and what-cha-who, but not for people named Rob.
<p>
I did find a ring named Rob's Ring.<br>
I checked it out and there were two sites: One for the owner, Rob, and one for his brother Mike.
<p>
That didn't exactly match what I had in mind, so I created the "Ring for people named Rob."
<p>
It turned out to be a bit more work than I first thought, but I believe I have everything under control. (but not perfect yet).
<p>
If you would like to join the Ring for people named Rob, I am thrilled!!  Click here to find out how.  (2003: ring doesn't exist)

<p class=date>Wednesday 25 March 1998</p>
<p>
This is my page.<br>
For some reason I sometimes feel that it's inadequate- not worthy of being viewed by zillions of people.. that they would look briefly and scoff and leave.
<p>
But who cares, eh? I won't know if they hated it, unless they take the time to send me email (which is actually more flattering than them just leaving) and my counter will just slowly click up and up and I'll see that people are at least stopping in to look.
<p>
So am I actually afraid that my counter will click higher and higher and no one will write?  No one will say, "hey!  I like The PIN!  I love the Feel Good Net!  Keep it up.  keep it up"<br>
That is actually what scares me more.  What if <em>everyone</em> comes by and no one cares?
<p>
When I surf, I am most impressed with people who have really put themselves on their page through art, pose, poetry, photography.. I like to know what people love!  Or more precisely I like to know that people are pursuing what they love!!
<p>
So what about me?  I love crafting my page. I sometimes get so anal about making it consistent that I spend a lot of time doing that.. Consistency also helps me keep track of what all is here and lets me be pretty certain that all my links work.<br>
Have you noticed that every page (except for 1 (I think)) is the same color??
<p>
Anal.
<p>
(But wait.. I don't mean "I love crafting my page" like it's the core of my existence, but I love crafting my page to describe what I do when I'm actually living life.)  (just wanted to clear that up)
<p>
But I enjoy messing with it, and I think I may try to loosen up some and maybe make a page be a different color.  Maybe a random color by sticking in BGCOLOR="abcdef".  I think I'll even do that for this page, which would mean there are <b>TWO</b> pages on my site with different background colors!!!!!!!!
<p>
Wow.  I just checked what the color looks like on my browser and I love it!!!!<br>
I absolutely take that as a sign that I'm on the right path.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
Oh yeah.. so it's my birthday and I'm at work and I really haven't done much work today, but I have done some surfing and html crafting.. (This is one of the lovely perks of being a programmer. Some days I just don't do anything productive for The Company)<br>
The love/hate perk I have is ISDN web access from my house. I stay connected too darn much for my own good.
<p>
I have pretty much decided to not be working here by August or September.  I respectfully thankfully intend that I will be making money doing something I love.  Or that I'll be doing more of what I love and have more time to do it.  <br>
I don't really care about the dollars; I thankfully trust the money I need will arrive.
<p>
It's 16:34 by the clock on my phone.<br>
Tonight the youth group, Wende, my mom, her husband, and his daughter (my step sister!  I have a sister now!) Alicia will meet at House of Pies at 19:00.
<p>
See ya.</p>

<p class=date>25 March 1998</p>
<p>
The LRY dinner was at House of Pies tonight.  Because it was my birthday, my mom, her husband Jon and his daughter Alicia were all there. Jon's friend Donna showed up just because, and LRY youth Paul, Elaine, Laura, kT, Dennis were there and Wende got there a bit late because of work.
<p>
I had big fun and enjoyed briefly describing my college experience to Elaine, who plans to attend Texas A&M in the fall.
<p>
Alicia grabbed and munched cottage fries that I offered her with my fork, and Jon took composite pictures of my body with Elaine's head and Alicia's body with Laura's head, made possible with the mirror between our tables.
<p>
(I'll ask him to scan those so I can put them on here)
<p>
I got a weird little wall hanging thing made from "found stuff" by a guy named Tony Romano.  Hmmm.
<p>
I waved my fork dancingly in the air as everyone boistrously sang Happy Birthday to me.
<p>Yay!!</p>

<p>
Today I was accepted into <a href=https://www-personal.umich.edu/~airyn/spiritring.html>The Spirit Ring</a> and I have spruced up my page a bit in hopes that more people will come see my site.  I had 710 hits on my japanese counter and 318 hits on my other counter... We'll see what happens...
<p>
At work I found a quarter on my desk with a note written on the back of one of my business cards:
<p>
<pre>
       Happy B-day.
         This is for the 
          M&M Machine  
              - Molly
</pre>
<p>
I bought a small handful of M&Ms before I sat down.
<p>
Since then I haven't actually worked yet today. I've just been goofin' around on my page and stuff.

                        <p><title>More Gymnastics</title></p>

<p class=date>Tuesday 24 March 1998<br></p>
<p>
Today I got to attend gymnastics again after the gym was closed for 2 weeks.  During those two weeks the moved to a larger facility and I love it!  The new place is way bigger and has two floors, two runway trampolines, two big trampolines, a vault, 1 high bar, 3 uneven bars, several low bars, and plenty of room for more stuff that hasn't been installed yet!
<p>
I did not really stretch or practice or anything for the two weeks, so I was a bit cautious on the floor.  My first bigger passes were just roundoffs, testing out my leg which I hurt playing Ultimate this weekend.
<p>
It felt pretty good, so I pulled some roundoff back flips, and once I did 3 goods ones in a row, I did a punch front flip.
<p>
Then I did some standing back handsprings! I haven't done them in years and years, and way back then I didn't do them super well.  But today they were as good as ever and getting better. I need to stretch out my tummy before I get too crazy doing those again.
<p>
Kenneth spotted me on about 4 in a row and I got pretty sloppy because of tired arms.
<p>
So I bounced over to the runway trampoline where Sarah, Tanya and Ashley were tumbling.  Sarah was doing roundoff backs with two twists; Tanya and Ashley were doing mostly back flips with 1/2 twists or just sloppy back flips.
<p>
I did some simple front flips and tried a couple of 1+1/4 back flips but never really got them straight enough to go all the way.
<p>
All too soon our 55 minutes was up, though we often stretch it out to and hour 15 minutes...  Not tonight.
<p>
See ya soon!!!</p>

Notice how he warms up vs. how Sean warms up [in the background skying
for a catch] and look at the results [also notice how i warm up behind
the camera! hehehe :) ]<br>

<p class=date>Sunday 22 March 1998</p>

<p>
Written by Rod Meek
<p>
And so our team has returned from the Centex Ultimate Tournament in
Austin,
flushed with...uh...defeat. The Saturday Night Specials have now been
renamed
the Saturday Night Special Olympics, and our entry fee was picked up by
our
"opponents" (though that word implies a reasonably even contest) who
were glad
to earn cheap victories at our expense. We lost three on Saturday and
then
another in single-elimination in the consolation (read: "losers")
bracket on
Sunday. The scores: 17-3, 17-2, 17-9, and 13-9. The number of points
required
for a victory seemed kinda variable--last year, teams only had to rack
up 11
to beat us.
<p>
The first game day did not start auspiciously for me, as I had no sooner
arrived at the field than I locked my keys in my truck. I had to send
Cog back
to his sister-in-law's house to get that all-purpose tool, a coat
hangar,
which worked marvelously well and quickly popped the lock. (Mental
note: don't
leave valuable stuff in truck at Saturday night game.) However, all else
looked good, except Paul declined to show, having a foreboding of what
was to
come. But at least the weather was nice, unlike the arctic conditions
at the
previous tournament.
<p>
Our first match was against Old Yeller, a pack of 40-year-olds, the same
blokes that whipped us in our Tuesday At Four incarnation last year. I'm
pleased to report we tripled our point output over last year's match
against
them. We really had no hope against these guys, and we still hadn't
quite
figured out what to do or why we were on the field. At least they put
us out
of misery with swift efficiency. Afterwards, we suffered our first
casualty,
John, who stole my thunder and stormed off the field in a rage, never
to be
seen again. Luckily, some German guy named Brauer had joined us, so we
still
were able to have four people loitering on the sidelines for
substitutions. 
<p>
The next game was against some other team that had looked to us to be
really
good. Unfortunately, looks were not deceiving, and they thrashed us
mercilessly. Mark commemorated this debacle by puking all over the end
of the
field.
<p>
The third massacre was against a pack of deranged mutants that spent a
great
deal of their time milling about the sidelines, muttering "Nub nub, nub
nub."
This diabolical tactic worked all too well on me and filled me with
soul-
numbing fear. It also had some effect on Brick, who showed up to taunt
us, and
soon found himself also puking all over the end of the field. But we
had other
skills than projectile vomiting, and the game was at least reasonably
close
this time. Since we had lost so rapidly in our first two matches, we
were
well-rested, whereas the Nub-nubs had fought hard and had only enough
energy
to maul us badly with little finesse. 
<p>
I completed my awful day by going back to the Ramada Inn (filled with
surly
and incompetent employees whose loathing of us was scarcely concealed)
and
accidentally  smashing my head into the underside of a staircase.
Unhappily,
my plan to get a concussion to excuse myself from the Sunday game came
to
naught, and it was with great reluctance that I found myself at the
field the
following morning.

This time we faced the Hammerheads from Corpus Christi, and at last we
met a
foe worthy of us, which means a team that was filled with as many old,
fat,
and slow people as ours, and nearly as many complainers and whiners and
the
dreaded Makers of Bad Calls. At one point we nearly had to convene a
civil
court out there just to sort through the calls and countercalls, though
Cog
was correctly busted for his infamous "Cog shuffle" when he was a
thrower. The
worst moments were when Will blazed across the endzone we were
defending and
slapped away what would have been a score, only to get tripped up with
the
intended receiver, who seized advantage of the situation to call a
foul, even
though the disk was blocked before the contact and batted so far away
that it
was unplayable even without contact. Then the Hammerheads reacted with
outrage
when Tim skied up for a catch, got speared in the back, and called his
own
foul. It pretty much devolved after that point, with strips, fouls, out
of
bounds, and picks being called in a flurry. I think I even heard "dog on
field" being cried out. In any event, we had a real chance in this
game, and
afterwards everyone felt pretty damn good.
<p>
Items of note:
<p>
1) The team MVP was the canopy Tim bought for the Sunday game, so we
would no
longer broil in the sun. We were the envy of all and could've charged
admission to our shaded splendor. I think we've got the equipment angle
pretty
well taken care of; we knew enough this time to bring chairs and
sunblock
(though most of us were too dim-witted to realize that the sun would
shine on
our arms and legs and not just our faces, so consequently horrific
burns were
a common affliction). 
<p>
2) Our team name got printed on a Centex shirt available for a low, low
price.
We can now be associated in print with such giants as Club Mud and the
Hound
Dogs. 
<p>
3) Wonder Boy was totally macking out there and was rewarded with
several new
phone numbers from female admirers.
<p>
4) Brick came in for a single series and discovered it is difficult to
play if
one has spent the day gorging on candy bars and cookie dough and then
hits the
field wearing long pants. 
<p>
5) Cog's young children were exposed to the traumatic experience of
seeing
Daddy slapped silly by our opponents. I sense many years of expensive
psychotherapy in their futures. 
<p>
As for my own performance, it can be catalogued as shown below:
<p>
1) No one can deny that I was periodically on the field.
<p>
2) There is no number 2.
<p>
I certainly excelled in general pessimism ("We're all doomed", "We
suck",
etc.), whininess ("How come we don't get to play other losers just like
us?"),
petty backbiting ("Bill's the single greatest menace we've ever
known--to our
own team") and explosions of rage ("Bite me, Tim!"). I can only
recommend that
should I choose to play at Centex again, I be kept heavily medicated at
all
times. 
<p>
Be that as it may, I would like to blame--er, thank--Tim for the effort
he put
into organizing this, which was no small feat. Now, if he can arrange
regular
scrimmages for us against Club Mud, maybe we'll have a shot next year...
<p>
"Wa-hoo!" (the sound from the other team every time I touched the disk)

<b>STATE OF MY LIFE</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>
I normally don't do State of My Life Addresses so chronologically
close together, but I am now.
</li>
<li>
At work I've been working much longer hours than normal and I'm still not getting my project done as fast as I want.  I'm working in C++ and I'm stuck on a problem I'm having with some objects written by another group. The objects are designed to create a menu system and allow user input, etcetera. However, for some reason I can't get them to trap CTRL-Z the way I want. It's been pissin' me off for 4 days now.

<li>
I just found out about dates that Tori Amos is going to play on her tour!  I'm way excited! I'd like to see her in Los Angeles, because then I can see Jen, who is my Tori Amos fan soulmate! Jen's birthday is the same as mine (25 March).
</li>
<li>
I'm listening to <b>nine inch nails</b> <em>closer to god</em> CD.
</li>
<li>
This weekend I'm going to Austin to play Ultimate!
