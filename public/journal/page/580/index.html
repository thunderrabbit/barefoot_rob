<p class=date>6:56pm CST Friday 8 December 2000</p></p>

<p>All day today I had my radio at work tuned to 91.7fm, waiting for
KTRU to come back on the air.  The plan was for it to come on at
4:05pm, but I listened all day, just in case.</p>

<p>World Radio Network (<a href="https://www.wrn.org">www.wrn.org</a>)
had been broadcast for the bulk of the week that we were off the air.
At about 3:30pm, KTRU stopped broadcasting WRN and just "played"
static.  At 4:05pm there was a slight cough or blorp sound as the
transmitter was turned back on.

<p>Kristin spoke "KTRU Houston" and the MRA on(*), then played the Miles
Davis song that had been cut short last week.  She prefaced the song
with something like, "you've been listening to an 8 day silent remix
of Miles Davis, now we return to our regulary scheduled broadcast," or
something like that.</p>

<p>(*) In perfect college radio fashion, she mispoke our wattage at
first, "with an effective radiated power of five thousand, fifty
thousand watts..."  Very cute.</p>

<p>I listened to the rest of her show and then to the KTRU news show
while I read about XML.</p>

<p class=date>7:07pm CST Friday 8 December 2000</p></p>

<p>Karla mentioned that we might want to begin getting smart in XML,
which is used by some HR departments to exchange data.  I pretty much
knew nothing about XML, so I read the XML Faq.</p>

<p>Very interesting.  I think HTML is an example of an SGML, and XML
is a subset of SGML.  XML allows one to describe a protocol, such as
HTML, and a whole lot more.</p>

<p>I might begin to write HTML as "well defined" XML instead of my
somewhat sloppy but passable HTML.  I started with the previous entry
about KTRU, and have kept it up through this entry.  I haven't gone
through journal.cgi to make it produce well defined XML, which I know
it does not.</p>

<p>Then again, I might decide it's not worth the effort.</p>

<p>It is, certainly, interesting to learn about SGML and XML, even if
I don't know them <em>per se</em>.  I wonder how/if we will actually
begin to use XML at work to transfer data with HR departments.</p>

<p>Oh, and I downloaded DocZilla (<a
href="https://www.doczilla.com">www.doczilla.com</a>), but it didn't
seem to be nearly stable enough for me to use it instead of Netscape,
which is hardly completely stable itself.</p>

<p>- - - - </p>

<p>OH!!!!!!!!!  And today we ordered a new computer for me at work!!
A PIII 1GHz processor with 512 Meg ram, 40Gig HD, 10/100T,
48X CD, speakers, 17" monitor, Natural (curved) keyboard, mouse, etc
etc for $1784 from <a href="https://www.dell.com">Dell</a>!!!  It
should be in around 14 December.  Yay!!!</p>

<p>Wende has just arrived at home; we are about to go meet peeps from
our investment club for our holiday gift exchange party.</p>

<p class=note>(lucid dream)</p>

<p><p class=lucid>I was within a cave tunnel thing and floating down into
its interior.  A bad guy of sorts was trying to chase me, but I
thwarted him by being elusive and just using my dream-power of
intention to simply intend that he did not reach me.  Therefore he did
not.</p>

<p><p class=lucid>I woke up barely and could feel my body as it was
sleeping in bed, and I wondered if I could astral project myself out.
I floated out of my body and down near the floor beside the bed; I
didn&rsquo;t have precise control over my motion.</p>

<p><p class=lucid>I woke up and told Wende and she was all excited and
the scene faded</p>

<p><p>I fell more deeply asleep and then woke up later.  I remembered the
experience while in the shower.</p>

Subject: Mystery solved?

HI Karla

Upon clearing my desk, I may have solved a mystery.  I found five forks.
Not one, nor two,
but five (count 'em: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) forks.

But now there is an even grander mystery:  What causes the forks to migrate
to my desk?
Are they attracted to brilliance?  Were they protesting?  Maybe they were
just hanging out.
For now, I have washed them and returned them to the strainer.  I'll keep an
eye out for any
further fork shenanigans.

    - Rob

<p><p>A press release has been released, indicating that KTRU will go
back on the air tomorrow at 4 PM.  I dunno how that time was chosen,
but I&rsquo;m super glad that we&rsquo;ll be back on the air!!</p>

<p><p>There&rsquo;s supposed to be a big hoopla event thingy to celebrate the
broadcast.</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>Speaking of tomorrow, it&rsquo;s already tomorrow in Australia, which is
where Irene and Nick live.  Wende and I just chatted with them for
almost an hour on AIM.  I was on a java version which doesn&rsquo;t
interpret HTML markup, so it printed &lt;PRE &gt; and &lt;/PRE &gt; around
everything.</p>

<p><p>Good night.</p>

<p class=date>10:06pm CST Wednesday 6 December 2000</p>

<p><p>I haven&rsquo;t read any of the KTRU emails since 7pm, but as of that
time, it seems fairly likely that KTRU DJs will choose to approve the
final draft of the proposal and we will therefore be back on the air
soon.  I am so so looking forward to being back on the air.  It&rsquo;s
amazing to see how much passion I have for the station after it was
taken away.</p>

<p><p>Donna, with whom I have been tag-teaming the 7-9pm Saturday shift
this semester, has asked if I can do this coming shift.  I told her
totally yes; I am anxious to be back on.</p>

<p><p>KTRU DJs Johnny, Sarah, Ben, Alexi and Dennis all worked with
people from the Student Association for 6 or 7 hours each day for the
past 3 days to hammer out this document.  I have voted YES for it, and
the general tone seems that most other DJs will vote YES as well.  the
voting is due tonight at midnight.  I imagine we will have the tally
tomorrow in the morning.</p>

<p><p>If the tally is YES, I hope that the station will go back on
without unreasonable delay.</p>

<p class=date>10:25pm CST Wednesday 6 December 2000</p>

<p><p>So I&rsquo;ve been transcribing entries from August 1992.  Pages and
pages from when I worked for Good Morning America at the Hyatt Regency
during the Republican National Convention.  It seems I played Nerf
football catch with Charlie Gibson, drove a fly ride to the Astrodome,
got paid to sleep, turned down driving people to interview Barbara
Bush, and flirted with every female in the hotel.  (Not necessarily in
that order)</p>

<p><p>I am most entertained by my refusal to drive for the interview
thing.  I chose to hang out with my friend Dave instead.  Would I have
chosen that now?  I dunno.</p>

<p><p>Very interesting as well, I find that my sleep schedule was happily
random compared to my sleep schedule now.  It seems I just had fewer
things on which to focus.  Is that actually true or just my perception
of the past?  If it&rsquo;s true, do I want that again?  If I do, how do I
create that reality?  Hmmmm.</p>

the negotiators have been receiving legal advice from
Lewis Taishoff 
(over 
email).  i do have the contact info for a lawyer who
is willing to help 
in 
person with our negotiations if they continue.  this
is the third day 
negotiations have gone on (for about 6-7 hours a day).
 we seem to be 
nearing an agreement.

Rice students protest closing of radio station

HOUSTON (AP) - Hundreds of Rice University students
rallied Monday to
protest the administration's shutdown of the campus
radio station.
University officials shut down station KTRU-FM on
Thursday because disc
jockeys, protesting a push to air more athletic
events, played music 
during
a women's basketball game.
"For over 30 years, KTRU has been one of the most
successful and 
creative
outlets for student expression at an American
university," said former 
KTRU
general manager Roddy Gibbs, a 1992 Rice graduate who
traveled from his
Austin home to address the rally.
The 50,000-watt station, one of the nation's most
powerful college 
radio
stations, has been run by students since it opened in
the late 1960s.
University officials are trying to negotiate a power
struggle with the
students over the station's autonomy. Meanwhile, the
station operates 
with
broadcast feeds from the World Radio network.
Rice is proposing that a committee of students and
administrators 
oversee
station policy but allow students to make most
programming decisions,
"If the issue is 100 percent student autonomy, it's
well clear that's 
not
going to happen," Rice spokesman Terry Shepard told
the Houston 
Chronicle in
Tuesday's editions. "Anyone who has a job knows you do
not have 
complete
autonomy, you have responsibilities to your employer.
All we're saying 
is
it's a lesson in responsibility."
Student protesters rejected the university's position.
"They say accountability and responsibility, but what
they mean is 
control,"
computer science graduate student John Clements told
fellow students at 
the
rally.
"They want a station of moderate viewpoints, total
pushovers," he said. 
"You
guys have a brain and a heart, you're not what they're
looking for."
Some protesters illustrated their point by covering
their mouths with
KTRU-FM bumper stickers, to signify the station being
silenced. They 
put the
same bumper sticker on the mouth of the statue of
William Marsh Rice, 
the
university's founder.
Station manager Johnny So, a senior from Pasadena,
said the students 
won't
budge on student control. But he said a resolution is
possible by this 
week.
