<p>I have been transcribing some old entries from 1987, when I first
started my journal.  Interesting to see my use of the word "you" when
I meant "people in general."  I used the term "messed around" or
"messin' around" a lot.  And lots of apostrophes instead of writin' a
g.</p>

<p>Also interesting to see me as a youth through my stories.  Chowing
even more ice cream than I do now.  Losing clothing and toiletries
during a camping trip.  Physically stronger than I am now.  Some
sadness that I haven't kept up that level of physique, but hey
whatever.  I am who I am.</p>

<p>They haven't been moved online yet, but someday soon they will
be.</p>

<p>I just sent out invitations to my 12,000th day party.  If you think
you wanna go, comment on this and I'll get details to you.  (if you're
invited, of course)</p>

<p>Had a silly type-o in the message I sent out "Party ime" instead of
"Party time."  Ah well.</p>

<p>Nice to reconnect with I-group tonight.  I wanted it to be all
about me, but Dennis, Robin, Tom all got to do some of their own
work.  I told them the stories behind the stories of the past six
months, those stories that I write but are not available on my
website.</p>

<p>Expressed my fear of going into the unknown of Japan, and my
conitnually expressed blessing that I live easily in the world.</p>

<p>Upon checkout, Tom expressed thanks to have me here in the circle,
and I immediately remembered YRUU and that Steve told me that I have
done some good in the community.  I cried recalling the story of the
cake YRUU loves Rob and Pin Rob on Japan.  So beautiful are the
memories.  Thank you, thank you.</p>

<p>I'm out.</p>

<p>I have my NOVA contract at my dad's house!</p>

<p>I never checked my cell phone messages until last night, the first
of which was my dad saying the Priority Mail package was here.</p>

<p>Part of me is bummed that my dad didn't try more thoroughly to
reach me, and part of me is bummed I wasn't checking my messages.  But
most of me is just excited and ready to move on.</p>

<p>I'm going through the documentation now to figure out what I need
to send them.</p>

<p>Once I send all my stuff in, they will send it off to Japan, and
once they've heard back from Japan, will let me know my departure date
and my new address and such.</p>

<p class=date>12:29pm</p>

<p>Woah!</p>

<p>The sample Education and employment resume shows 03/25 as the month
and date!</p>

<p class=date>1:09pm</p>

<p>Filled out everything I can so far for Nova.  Need to get Maggie's
zipcode, and get copies of my passport, and 6 new passport photos.  Oh
and I need to send them either a certified transcript, or my actual UH
diploma, that has been rolled up in a tube ever since I got it 8 years
ago.</p>

<p>I tried to look up Maggie's zipcode on my dad's computer, but it
Netscape kept fucking up and I used IE and it said it was out of
memory.  Aw man; I thought my dad was a computer kinda guy.  Seems
like he'd have a computer with enough memory to run a browser.</p>

<p>I'm gonna roll back to Houston and visit my old Kinko's to get
copies and passport photos and .. oh but first go by Maggie's and see
if she has my diploma rolled up.  I think I gave it to her.</p>

<p>And then play at Paint This! and then go to I-group.</p>

<p>Went to my dad's house, climbed through all the mail I've received,
especially the packet from Nova.  Filled out most of the forms, and
just need to get six passport photos and send everything off.</p>

<p>Found my diploma at Maggie's in the most easily accessible box of
those that she's holding for me.</p>

<p>At Kinko's now and cute Samantha was all, "may I help you?" and
stuff and she clicked my picture for passport photos, but no film.
She put the camera down, turned to get film and her leg caught the
power cord.  Shoop!  To the floor the camera cracked open.</p>

<p>"Shit!" she whispered forcefully..</p>

<p>I'll roll over to Kinko's in Rice Village and try again.</p>

<p class=date>5:30pm</p>

<p>I'm at the lodge now, an hour early for I-group.  I sent an email
last night telling my group I'd be here at this time in case any of
them wanted to come early and chat.  Maybe with some more timely
communication, they would have had time to plan for such.  We'll see
what happens.</p>

<p>The lodge is locked; maybe the guy who works here took the day off
to honor Martin Luther King Jr.</p>

<p>I went by Paint This! after getting 6 passport photos taken at
Kinko's nearby.  Jennifer said that someone had come by and said I was
going to be here.  Jennifer got the impression that I was apparently
supposed to be there from 11am to 4pm.  False.  Well, that's not what
I intended.  Anyway, hi Tina!</p>

<p>I slept during the last remnants of silent football and during
cleanup.  Russ woke me up around 8am to get my shiznit cleared out and
then hit closing circle.  The youth invited me to do Aristasha one
last time.  I did so gleefully.</p>

<p>Now it looks like basically everyone is cleared out and many have
headed to Denny's.  I'll join them now.</p>

<p>Great horde of people at Denny's as per usual.  I sat with Katie
Lerner, Sally West, Andy Andrews.  We were one of the last tables to
be seated and served, so we got to watch/hear about all the funnness
going on, like when Ed Lerner licked up the precious groovy juice from
the concrete when it spilled outside.  Woah.  Calder and Marta claimed
to have made Fred cry about something, which I seriously doubt, but
they thought it was pretty entertaining.</p>

<p>Afterward, countless precious hugs hugs hugs.  Steve Feinstein got
me the most: "no matter what anyone says, know that you made a
difference."</p>

<p>Wow.  wow wow wow so great to hear.  Beyond great.</p>

<p>Funny to say bye to OKC 15 passenger van by climbing in over all
the seats to hug everyone one by one, starting and ending with Tim
near the front.  Then laughing with Debu as the freshmen were all, "I
don't want to sit here; I want to sit there, blah blah blah" and we
were laughing like, "do they want to go home or what?"  and then
suddenly Tyler climbed out of the van with blood streaming out of his
nose and his teeth coated red with blood.  HAHAHahahaah!!!  Oh my god
what happened??  He was laughing at the hilarity of the situation.  So
he climbed out and it was later decided to put all the freshmen in the
back with the TV (a TV!!!!?????) and all the seniors move forward to
chat with Debbie and Anne.  During that shuffling, I climbed into the
back seat of the van and chilled out there, intending to be all, "oh
hey, I gotta get out!" when they started driving.  Anne saw me before
they rolled out though.  Good plan anyway.</p>

<p>Hand hugs through windows as they left, ran after the van for
several feet to slap 5 on the hands out the back window.</p>

<p>Hugs to Phat Pat, who had been doing a terrorist ninja roll thing
across the parking lot with a black ski mask on; listened to his story
of doing that in a movie theater where he works.</p>

<p>Meg Cusack ran up and gave me a big hug too.  Bright blue hair with
pink underside hair.  She doesn't often give me big hugs; it was nice.
She kinda tweaked my chin like it's been great, maybe see ya maybe
not.</p>

<p>Found anonymous notes and a cool hand made fanfold book on my car,
expressing love for me and thanks.</p>

<p>One more quick trip to pee and I found Tyler's blood on the sink
and floor.</p>

<p>It's been a great six years.  Thank you all so much.  Maybe see ya,
maybe not, but I will always hold you dearly in my heart.</p>

<br>Rob - I really don&rsquo;t know what to say here, I just saw the comment thing and thought &ldquo;hey, why not?&rdquo; Fred&rsquo;s poem almost made me cry durring talent show, and reading all that stuff nearly did it again. I feel like I&rsquo;m back at the bridging cerimony at SWUUSI, and you&rsquo;re only one person! Well, no, that&rsquo;s not right, you&rsquo;re more than one person, you&rsquo;re ROB. What that&rsquo;s an acronym for, I don&rsquo;t know yet, but trust me, it is one. I have little more to say right now; my stream of consciousness seems to be drying out. I&rsquo;ll do everything I can to keep in touch. Much love.<br>

<p>This game seems clearly a ridiculous thing, but funny in its own
fucked up way.</p>

<p>I did not have to give my email address to play, so it seems safe.</p>
