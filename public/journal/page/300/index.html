<p>I have just requested that my webquarry email account be changed
  to the new system so that I have email list capabilities built in.
  My intention is to send out an update, and I don't want to have to
  muck with the list myself so I looked into installing majordomo,
  but that requires root access, so I wondered if webquarry has email
  lists enabled already, and they do, but I have to be migrated to a
  new email server.  I think and hope and trust the process will be
  simple and quick and easy.</p>

<p>I also trust the new email thing will be easy enough for people to
  use that they will actually use it.   Eeek some second thoughts are
  coming, but hey we'll see how it goes.</p>

<p>I need to eat.  I bought eggs and spinach yesterday after work;
  I'll have them with Reece's Pieces from janette as I gaze happily
  up at the intricately cut Christmas ornament she made for me.</p>

<p><p><b>Comment:</b>
<br>ooooo! your words warm my heart.  i love that you appreciate my xmas gift to you. <br>
 do you make an omelet with your spinach and eggs?  i am so happy that you are beginning to cook for yourself. (please don&rsquo;t tell me that you actually eat the eggs and spinach And reece&rsquo;s at the same time. the idea of it turns my stomach.)<br>
  did you realize the impact you have on my internal organs? from 6000 miles away. wow. that blows my mind. d&rsquo;oh!<br>

HI HI HI from Japan!

I have been in Japan for 9 months and depending on how I look at it,
it seems both like forever and an instant.  I know I've been here for
a while though because recently I was able to help two Americans who
had just arrived in Tokyo and had basically no knowledge of the
language and wanted to buy cell phones.  I was able to hook them up
with free maps of the trains and show them where they could find a
variety of phone shops.

Recently I have been enjoying Japan more than I had been some months
ago.  Therefore it is likely that I will stay longer than my original
contract which is up in March.  Since I'm choosing to stay in Japan,
and choosing to like my job more, at work I have been working quite
deliberately to remember the names of my students.  This is
challenging due to the sheer number of students, the short period of
time we have to talk to them each day, and there's no way to really
predict when I will see them.

The benefit of learning their names: I will begin to remember their
specific English-speaking personalities and therefore be better able
to help each individual.  Also, it just seems like the right thing to
do, to care about my students.  Put forth some real effort kinda
thing.

I've been hanging out with students outside of work, which directly
violates Nova's rules, but has helped me learn Japanese and have more
fun and want to stay longer.

Also in the fun department, I've been hanging out with Morag from work
recently.  She and I seem to have similar outlooks on life and the
meaning of life and stuff like that.  We study Japanese together at
Starbucks on occassion.  So far, two Fridays in a row and a Thursday
in between.

janette and I have been making plans for her upcoming visit in January
which should be a lot of fun though I'll be working basically my
normal schedule at work.  I'll try to get some shift swaps done so we
can have more days off together.  We'll go to Fuji-Q Highland, the
biggest amusement park near Tokyo (and maybe all Japan) with a super
scary haunted house.

- - - -

In Japan, I have learned a lot about myself.  I have faced some of my
greatest fears (and shied away from others).  In this sprawling
collection of cities known together as Tokyo, I walk within huge
crowds and find myself utterly alone.  I have learned that I can make
sense of a completely foreign language.  I have learned that despite
the many cultural differences, people still like to be remembered by
name.

Over the months that I've been here I have watched myself create the
same type of busy busy life here in Japan that I had in the US.
Always moving, always wanting to be with people, always wanting
attention.  This proves to me that the patterns in my life are
manifested by or otherwise tied to me.

This weekend (my weekend is Tuesday and Wednesday), I have seen both
sides of this always-want-to-be-busy pattern.  Today I goofed around
on my computer and slept all day until people started coming home in
the evening.  Then when everyone was available, all the requests for
hanging out began to come back.  In the middle of watching a movie
with my roommates, my invitation to dinner with another friend was
accepted.  During that dinner, I got another email to watch a movie
tomorrow.  Juggling too many girl-friends it seems.  The good news is
they all know I have a real girlfriend, janette back home.

(I'm making progress.  During college all my girlfriends did not know
about each other (until they did, and that was a disaster).)

But what am I really *doing* in Japan?   That question keeps coming
back to my mind.

I'm having fun.  I'm learning the language.  I'm learning about
myself.  I think I'll hang out here for a while.

<br>Merry Christmas, Rob!<br>
<br>
It&rsquo;s good to know that you&rsquo;re liking Japan better, learning students&rsquo; names, and recognizing how much you&rsquo;ve learned. You could look at the past nine months as a fantastic Christmas gift to yourself!<br>
<br>
We&rsquo;ll be going to Jill&rsquo;s this afternoon to exchange gifts, then to Live Oak for a Christmas Eve service. At least this year the kids won&rsquo;t be climbing all over you! I&rsquo;ll be thinking of you, though.<br>
<br>
How will you spend your days off?<br>
<br>
I&rsquo;ve been kind of bummed since we exchanged a couple of heavy duty letters and you haven&rsquo;t written since. Are you mad? sad? irritated? indifferent? satisfied?<br>
<br>
Alicia is leaving Christmas morning to see her mom in Lawrence, KS. Karina will arrive Christmas night and wants some Thai food for dinner. In between, Jon and I will go caroling at Safe Place, a shelter for battered women and their children. Everyone&rsquo;s name had to be submitted ahead of time and we have to take photo IDs with us. We don&rsquo;t even know the location yet.<br>
<br>
Karina&rsquo;s mother Georgette Clegg will be in Austin Jan. 30-31. The two of them will probably see each other for the first time in 12 years. They are both terrified. Karina has felt abandoned by her mother most of her life. After a big dispute 12 years ago, the passage of time made it more and more difficult to bridge the gap. Now Georgette has lung cancer. It may be small cell cancer, one of the fastest and most virulent kinds. This may well be Karina and Georgette&rsquo;s only time to see each other. They still love each other on some level, but there&rsquo;s a lot of anger piled on top of it.<br>
<br>
Have a very happy holiday. I love you!<br>
<br>
Ma</p>

<p>Tomorrow I'm meeting 裕子 for lunch and then みき (not KG Miki) for
  dinner and movie, and this time I won't cancel because KG Miki
  cannot meet me tomorrow.  Last time I had invited each Miki to hang
  out and then KG Miki said yes before Miki said yes and Miki got
  bumped for KG Miki.</p>

<p>Ali and I hackey sacked as part of the Kawasaki Haki Saki
  competition.  He got 14 (again) and we both did some pretty fly
  stuff (for us) and I can see that my skills are getting better than
  they were when I played barefoot in YRUU.  Flat top shoes help.  I
  did some stalls and some outside kicks.  Good stuff.</p>

<p>We had put our coats and backpacks on and then started playing.
  Got really into it and began to take off backpacks and coats until
  we were back down to our work clothes.  Pretty funny.</p>

<p>Today was me an' ゆみ's first lesson at Gateway 21 since she got
  too busy with work.  She's in the process of quitting her job now;
  her last day is in two days.  Yahoooo for her.</p>

<p>She said that my Japanese has gotten better since I've seen her.
  Yahooo for me!</p>

<p>We had a lot of fun.  Oh my gosh she gave me this funny funny
  funny funny deer!   Dammit I'm almost too tired to upload the .mov
  file.  I hope you can see it.</p>

<p class=date>1:10am</p>

<p>Oh my gosh now I'm going to try and trim the first bit of the
  movie so the file is not so big.</p>

<p class=date>1:26am</p>

<p>Barf.  Unbelievable.  Inconceivable, except, it happened.  I used
  iMovie to crop the movie (didn't do anything except trim the front
  and back off the movie and then save as web file) and after I saved
  it I tried to view it, but it's just black.  No deer.  That sucks,
  dude.  Utterly reasonable with windows, but not on my Mac.  All
  this video shit is integrated.  Why doesn't it just work????</p>

<p>Anyway, yumi and I had big big fun.</p>

<p>Ugh.  Tired.   I ate raw spinach and Reece's Pieces (that I got
  from janette in the mail today, yay!!!) and got a card from Judy
  Bayley from UH.  Yay!</p>

<p>Part of me could just fall over and sleeeep, but I want to brush
  my toofes and I'll probably take a shower cause that requires less
  brainpower than washing my face only.</p>

<p>Inexplicable but true.</p>

<p>Today is winter solstice.  "Touji" in Japanese.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Yesterday work equaled okay.  A student asked if I would be a
  reference for him to volunteer overseas and I'd DEFINITELY do it,
  but I don't know him.  So I told him to ask his university English
  teacher but student said he (teacher) isn't available, and I
  encouraged him to pursue other routes to get to that teacher etc
  etc and stuff.</p>

<p>I checked the student's essay and made some changes, most notably
  the removal of "I love drinking!"</p>

<p>I was like, "I don't think that's the type of skills they're
  looking for in volunteers."</p>

<p>Today at work I worked really deliberately to learn all my
  students' names.  First class was a no show.  Second class I had
  four students.  こうじ, みどり, ともみ, and あすこ。  Third class
  was a guy named something wtih two t's like Attio and a guy whose
  folder is pink and he's named Watanabe or something.  Then a guy
  named としゆき, and then I had my break.</p>

<p>I was the first teacher to teach voice today, and there were three
  students: まゆき, きょうこ, and (another) こうじ。 Sixth class has
  escaped my brain. Seventh class was level three いくみ and eighth
  class was a kid named...  something. </p>

<p>So, in all, a great success rate for learning names today!</p>

<p>I just felt like calling this entry Honk.</p>

<p>I just read a 9 page article about video games as a new huge
  market that will begin to drive the movie industry.</p>

<p>Today I was walking alongside my fellow travelers and realized that
  I'm in this sea of humanity and wondered about the idea that we
  (humans) are each just focal points of emotions and we can draw to
  us positive love energy or negative fear energy.  Just by "thinking"
  (*) about it, or "focusing" (*) on such energies.</p>

<p>Like we're each little radios that can choose which frequencies of
  universal energy we choose to pick up.  What if we simply choose to
  allow the positive love energy of the universe to work through us?
  That's my choice; just walk around and act in loving ways all the
  time.</p>

<p>So what does that mean if I'm just a magnifying glass for certain
  energies of my choosing?  Maybe it means the secret to a happy
  healthy beautiful life is just to believe that we are living such a
  life.  That matches things that I "believe" (*) so far in the
  world.. that we create reality by thinking and we choose our own
  experiences whether consciously or not.</p>

<p>finish.  arigato.</p>

<p>(*) whatever these words mean.</p>
