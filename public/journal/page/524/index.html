<p>Wow.  I just read livejournal for the first time in
a few days.  Wow.  wow.</p>

<p>So I'm thinkin' about how Colleen's entry saying
"life just bitchslapped me in the face" is so true for
me.  How all the entries subsequent are supportive and
shocked and how ... this is so real.</p>

<p>This is the kinda shocking news that happens in my
dreams, from which I can wake up.  But I'm not waking
up from this one.</p>

<p>My 'grown up' life keeps me from just driving up to
wherever Matt's living now, but I send mental Big Rob
Hugs even so.</p>

<p>Nothing like a tragedy to pull people together.</p>

<p>I'm in a much better mood now, having taken a moment to do some things
for myself.</p>

<p>I emailed Jayne, my travel agent about information on Europe tour
packages.</p>

<p> - and -</p>

<p>I just signed up for ASL classes at <a href="https://www.llu.com">Leisure
Learning</a>.  1.5 hours for six weeks, each Wednesday starting 19
September.  :-)  :-)</p>

<p>I was in pure programming mode, with NIN in my headphones, trying to keep
all distractions out of the way.</p>

<p>An email was printed and placed on my desk; it indicated I had
inappropriately sent two emails this morning.</p>

<p>So I stopped my programming and researched the claim.</p>

<p>yes, in fact, according to the business rules, the two emails should not
have been sent out this morning.</p>

<p>But you know what?   Programmers shouldn't be fucking sending emails out
anyway.</p>

<p>That's my first complaint.</p>

<p>So I asked Kevin for a fix to the logic.  Basically SAS said a missing
numeric value + a numeric value = missing.  But I wanted it to treat missing
as 0, not missing.</p>

<p>Kevin replied that there are a whole host of functions that I need to be
more familiar with, and as I have time, I should peruse them.</p>

<p>My immediate reaction is when do I have time to do that if I'm sending
out emails and crap?</p>

<p>So then I think about it on a bigger scale.</p>

<p>Just recently I have asked for more dollars as salary, because I could
certainly be making more somewhere else.  So this may have prompted Kevin's
reply - if I'm going to be getting more $ I should know more SAS functions.
Makes sense.</p>

<p>But then I'm thinking, "I don't want to learn more SAS functions."</p>

<p>Then I'm thinking, "that's not very professional."</p>

<p>Then I'm thinking, "you know what, that extra $ I'm asking for is just to
get enough $ so that I'll be content to stay here in this industry that I
really don't like as much as I would like, say...  leading youth group tours
to Europe."</p>

<p>(At least that's true as far as I can tell.  I might hate it, but I have
to try it first.)</p>

<p>So... poop.  I'm going to call my travel agent now.</p>

<p>After work I cruised over to Dude's house, via
Walgreen's where I purchased an underwater camera and
some black construction paper.</p>

<p>Amidst talking and watching TechTV, we cut out some
numbers for <a
href="https://www.humanclock.com">humanclock.com</a>,
and brainstormed some fun ways to photograph them. 
The camera is so we can photograph them
underwater.</p>

<p>On TV we saw the <a
href="https://www.arrowdynamics.com/rides.php?rtype=4th%20Dimension">4th
Dimension</a> roller coasters.  Pretty amazing
stuff.</p>

<p>I zipped over to Kinko's and got the letters
laminated for $4.86.  We'll go to the pool on Friday
or this weekend and get fun pics!</p>

                        <p class=date>4:20pm Monday 3 September 2001</p>

<p>I just rode my bike around downtown for about 2 or 3 hours.  I'm pretty tired; I won't describe each detail.  Mostly, I explored slowly around Buffalo Bayou and Bayou Place and the new thing being built where Jones Plaza used to be.  I rode down a lot of steps at Wortham Center, through a lot of mud on the other side of the bayou after where the sidewalk ends.  So much history underneath the bridge, with a large water(?) pipe suspended from the bridge by ancient rusted framework, rivulets of water from broken rusty pipes drizzling into the bayou, in progress construction with rebar describing where concrete retaining wall will soon snake along the water.  Past that was mud super soft a few inches deep, and I mostly could ride through it in 1st or 2nd gear.  My tires coated with mud, shoes covered in mud, I 2nd geared up a gently sloping sidewalk to street level again, where I sought clean water to wash my tires, and clean sand or rocks to scrub off the mud.</p>

<p>I rolled in lazy ovals and figure 8s in a medium sized puddle, casually washing away the muck.  Up an old parking lot in search of gravel, I found myself next to some railroad tracks.</p>

<p>Over the small barricade, I rode in 2nd gear about 200 yards along the back side of the downtown post office, from near UH Downtown all the way past the Amtrak station and under I-45.  Slowly slowly slowly through their parking lot and through a tunnel that leads from their parking lot under the new entrance/exit of the I-10 HOV lane to the post office.  Around the corner I found myself at the very entrance of the HOV lane.  It was blocked, but I had come in from behind the barricades.  The entire HOV was empty, beckoning me to ascend slowly hundreds of feet over the I-45/I-10 interchange, then exhilarate down the other side, some 2 miles away.</p>

<pre>
                             PEDESTRIANS
                                 AND
                              BICYCLES
                             PROHIBITED
</pre>

<p>Except for that one detail, it seemed like a great idea.</p>

<p>A section of missing fence allowed me to easily visit the construction on Jones Plaza.  It's being built into an ampitheater of some sort, with winding stairs and some weird constructs whose purpose I can only guess.  Many bags of Textured Blasting Sand were stacked; they were not being used to sandblast, but to provide a level surface for laying bricks as the walking surface of the theater.  This surface will make it pretty skater unfriendly.</p>

<p>I discovered an door in a wall with a ladder in the floor, but chose not to explore down the ladder.  I'm pretty sure I can guess what type of stuff I would find, plus I was feeling watched, or at least somewhat conspicuous.</p>

<p><p>Toward YMCA for a drink and discovered that the new Enron tower has a cool walkway from building to building across the streets.  It&rsquo;s perfectly circular, and connects buildings on three of the four corners of the intersection.  Very fine architecture skillz.</p>

<p>Closing circle:
<br>Ants and Cheese (fast)
<br>Aristisha (short)
<br>Boogaloo (loud to quiet)
<br>Senior circle - Good Friends (beat box); Row Row Row Your Boat (loud); Bish Bish (whispered)</p>

<p>Mugbooks = mailed</p>

<p>I just learned that Sean rescued two shirts without 'CON' from the trash.</p>

<p>Scott just asked if I was writing about him.  I said yes.</p>

<p>OH!!!  The whole reason I'm writing:</p>

<p>On the way over here from the rally to Denny's, Mark took off his shirt.  With that funny Mark smile, he sat just without his shirt saying "Fuck  hheheheheheheheh fuck fuck heheheheh ass heheheheheh fuck hehehhehehehheheh shit fuck fucker heheheheheheh."</p>

<p>I was laughing so hard so funny so hilarous!</p>

<p>He got out and Scott got out and Ryan and Dan got out of their respective cars, all wearing no shirts and going, "life is fucking great,"  "I feel so fucking free!"</p>

<p>Sean:</p>

<p class=message>Rob butters his pancake (singular) with butter so that the top changes color from dark brown to weird creamy whipped butter color. he cuts them up like fingers and pours syrup over the fingers carefully not letting any get on the plate. then he declares that he will make it a morphious strip. so he folds a pancake strip into a half-twist circle and starts to rip it in two. rip. rip. ri-nope. it doesnt work to well, it starts to fall apart and he goes "ahhh it's falling apart!!" i say "that's because it's a pancake." hahahahaha we all had a good laugh.</p>

<p class=date>11:23 am 2-9-01</p>

<p>Denny's:
<ol><li>Scottie learning that Tabasco Sauce is good on Asian.</li>
<li>bryn showing me and actually letting me borrow her Connections Abroad magazine.</li>
<li>Tanner's group making a chalice out of the Denny's Toys</li>
<li>Another group making a perfect sphere with Denny's Toys</li>
<li>Almost playing a spontaneous game of SF.</li>
</ol></p>

<p class=date>11:51 am</p>

<p>sleep now  oh  its about 475 miles from woodlands to tulsa</p>

<p class=date>6:27 pm</p>

<p>We're now leaving Corsicana, where we spent a solid hour and 1/2 munching and chilling and dropping off Paul.  Meg, Natalie, Ryan and I cruised over to Sonic.  Actually Ryan was late because he had to go back to invite Susie to bounce on the moonwalk.  Ryan therefore ordered last, and because he ordered a single onion ring, he got his order first.  Like way first.  He was done eating and had finished digesting before we got our food.</p>

<p>Next project: advertise a pickup game of Silent Football.</p>

<p class=date>10:24 pm</p>

<p>I have just arrived home.  I'm quite excited about the idea of having a pickup Silent Football game.  The idea arrived in my mind when Ryan approached me 1/2 jokingly(?), "Rob, why aren't there any pickup Silent Football games?"</p>

<p>"There may be some, but we just run with the wrong crowds," was my quick funny answer.  But as I think about it, I imagine this could be a pretty cool thing!</p>

<p>Silent Football is a rather entertaining game to watch.  It's funny, innovative, sometimes uproariously hilarious!  We could have a few chairs arranged in a circle at the back of Notsuoh or something, put some lights on and just play.</p>

<p>If we had about 5 people who knew how to play to start the games rolling, we could make it a monthly event.  Every 3rd Friday or something.  Maybe every 2nd Friday so that it would sometimes be Friday the 13th.</p>

<p>SF on SF.  Silent Football on Second Fridays.</p>

<p>We'll see.</p>

<p>We arrived around 3:30am I think; and we didn't get lost!!!!</p>

<p>Hugs and hugs and registration and picture for mugbook.</p>

<p>It took Bryn and I a full hour to walk from the ground floor up two levels to find Sean to tell him HI.  We were happily interrupted for hugs and stories and all kinds of good stuff.</p>

<p>Talkin' to Bryn and Sean now.  Bryn knows only 20 people that are registered.</p>

<p>Bryn was all, "I don't want this new 'technologically advanced' Silent Football."</p>

<p>The white-bracelet touch group's first task was to cook breakfast on Saturday morning.</p>

<p class=message>For each egg in your recipe substitute 1-1/2 teaspoons Ener-G Egg Replacer mixed thoroughly with 2 tablespoons water, i.e. 1-1/2 teaspoons Ener-G Egg Replacer +  2 tablespoons water=1 egg.</p>

<p>So I was all, "hmm.  I'm not measuring 16 ounces worth of 1.5 teaspoons of egg powder, nor calculating how much water that requires.."  So I poured the vegan-egg-powder into a bowl, and poured a pile of water on it.</p>

<p>Mix mix mix mix mix</p>

<p>Mix mix mix mix mix</p>

<p>Mix mix mix</p>

<p>Mix mix mix mix</p>

<p>Mix</p>

<p>Mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix</p>

<p>It looked like a frothy mixture of water and dish soap.</p>

<p>Hmm.  Oh well.</p>

<p>Poured 1/2 the mixture into a pan.  Cook cook cook cook cook cook cook.</p>

<p>Slowly, the water evaporated, the mix coagulated, everyone watching evacuated, and it came out like a huge white blob of thick Slime.   It was tasteless.  Gross.   Ewwwww.</p>

<p>Turns out, that this stuff is supposed to replace a couple eggs at a time in a <em>mixture of something else</em> that would normally require eggs.  In short, it will replace eggs in any recipe... except eggs.</p>

<p>the pancakes were great.</p>

<p>Just went to the Myers-Briggs personality type workshop.  Before I fell asleep (for the first time at the rally), I learned that I am ENFP.  Specifically,</p>

<p>E slight
<br>N clear
<br>F moderate
<br>P clear</p>

<p>By far, most people were ENFP.  She said ENFP was indicative of UU tendencies.</p>

<p>According to the workbook, ENFP is:</p>

<p class=message>Warmly enthusiastic and imaginative.  See life as full of possibilities.  Make connections between events and information very quickly, and confidently proceed based on the patterns they see.  Want a lot of affirmation from others, and readily give appreciateion and support.  Spontaneous and flexible, often rely on their ability to improvise and their verbal fluency.</p>

<p>According to the other handout she gave us, (and that she wrote), the middle two letters indicate a spiritual path-type.</p>

<p>NF personality type: the journey of harmony:</p>

<p><ol><li>The quest toward authentic, actualized self-hood.</li>
<li>Mystical harmony</li>
<li>A life attitude of expectany</li>
<li>The importance of openness to healing and the place of the dream in this process.</li>
<li>Social idealism</li>
<li>Focus on the process in relationships, familial and social.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>Mentors for this journey:
<br><ul><li>Rabindranath Tagore</li>
<li>Jesus of Nazareth (especially look at Jesus: <em>A Revolutionary Biography</em> by John Dominic Crossan)</li></ul></p>

<p>Right now Steve and Ryan are playing Beatles tunes on guitar.  Bryn knows most of the songs; I know very few.</p>

<p class=message>good disc just now. i love goin up with tanner and not hurting myself!
earlier there was a 'fishbowl' but the leader of this thing didnt know what a fishbowl was so it was kinda screwy. i sat next to Steve. he took some good notes that i wanna read later. it was about the  2 new rules. and how people dont like them or whatever. i'm sure Rob wrote about it.  well my weekend is all coming together, right now i'm listening to Steve play the guitar and singing beatles. well  i guess i'll go give Rob his Visor back. p.s. my visor doesnt work with the keyboard cause of some driver buuuull-sheet. and our visors dont like to beam to eachother.
<br>Rob likes oatmeal rasin cookies.</p>

<p>OATMeal!!!  yipyipyipyipyipyipyipyipyip!  Ah hah!  ah hah!</p>
