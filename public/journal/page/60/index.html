<p>Well crap.  I am sorry to say I missed the lesson time as Mutsumi
understood it.  She was thinking 8pm <em>every</em> week, whereas I thought
it was just for last week.</p>

<p>Sorry, Sarumama.</p>

<p>I was late to SOGO because I was late leaving and forgot my phone so
had to come back.</p>

<p>I was a bit late arriving, but they were late starting so it all
worked out.  Haha we worked out as well.  My toe injury did not bleed
and was basically fine, though now it&rsquo;s dirty.  I was puffed by the
group workout at the end, running while piggybacking Naoki, but even more
impressive was him running while piggybacking me.</p>

<p>Went to lunch with Zach, Naoki, Ai, and Asuka at the mexican
restaurant where the SOGO group has been going recently.  Hella closer
than the other Mexican place, but fewer lunch options.</p>

<p>Glad I got my phone so Tariq and I could coordinate meeting after
SOGO.</p>

<p>After work today, Lin and I met at the station and as a little
&ldquo;romantic&rdquo; gift, I bought reserved seats so we could take Romance Car
to our station.  It was nice to just be able to relax all the way
home.  Curiously, when Lin tried to pay for my bus fare, it wouldn&rsquo;t
go through so the driver just let us on the bus free.  Yay!</p>

<p>I guess we should try to pay for each other&rsquo;s fare more often on the
bus, to help them get the bugs out of their system, and to get free
seats.</p>

<p>Did five pomodoros on ConSwi today, including refactoring the code to
ostensibly make it simpler, but for some reason I could not get the
tiles to respond to touches.  So I will try to make an overlay that
captures all touches and have it tell which piece got touched.</p>

<p><a href="https://complice.co/?r=pgej30cphu">Complice</a>(referral link) has a
neat feature of parsing the Intention and automatically marking it as
complete.  I will definitely take advantage of that in the future.</p>

<p>I cannot decide if I should care that my accountants apparently cannot
spell or cannot hire proofreaders or what.  Does it make a difference?
Should I complain?  Stop using them?  Is this just a case of English
language changing?</p>

<p>I mean language is a tool to transmit meaning between people and
written language is a tool to transmit meaning across time as well.  I
know what they mean, but could there be a case where it&rsquo;s not clear?
&ldquo;It is&rdquo; contains a verb, but &ldquo;its&rdquo; contains the idea of possession.</p>

<p>Anyway, I left them a note and hope they will fix it and give me a
discount for reporting it, like a bug bounty program.  But until it&rsquo;s
fixed, I will not recommend their service.</p>

<p>Tomoko did well in our lessons in the SSC.  She had to give a
presentation in English today.  Midori does not have to present as
soon so she is trying to memorize more, it seems.</p>

<p>Lessons were after we ate lunch together on the 4th floor.  I still
kinda feel like an outsider there, as if my face and Visitor badge are
flashing beacons.</p>

again now that the new verbal agreement has started.</p>

<p>Recently I found
<a href="https://complice.co/?r=pgej30cphu">complice (referral link)</a> which
seems like a pretty good system for organizing my day and stuff.  I
have 19 days in my free test period.</p>

<p>Complice has a slight learning curve, but built-in pomodoros plus a
magic way that when I open a new tab it reminds me what my latest
thing to do is.  Complice connects my tasks with my larger goals, and
allows me to fill in some of the WHY I am doing different tasks, to
help keep me on task.</p>

<p>It is because of complice that I am writing this journal entry now.</p>

<p>Anyway, I stubbed the <del>crap out</del> <ins>skin off</ins> of my
toe yesterday and will wear shoes for a bit.</p>

<p>I wonder how long that image will be available.</p>

<p>Right now I am writing this entry while waiting for the AB server to
finish its backup.</p>

<p>Ah wait a minute.  Another backup started at the same time.  That may
be why they are going slowly.  I will look at them tomorrow.</p>
