<p>Great lesson today with GG class: we finished taking apart the 1TB
hard drive, which cost just over $200 in 2009.</p>

<p>(I <a href="/journal/2015/12/01/how-to-kill-an-external-hard-drive-for-only-a-few-dollars/">thoughtlessly destroyed it with magnets</a>; oops!)</p>

<p>I think I net 3000 yen per GG lesson, so I got half the hard drive
price back by taking it apart across three lessons.</p>

<p>Lessons at T today were good; my five students all had ample
questions, and I&rsquo;m beginning to remember their names.  It&rsquo;s a bit hard
because the lessons are only once every 2 weeks, and they take turns
taking lessons, so I might see each of the students once a month for
45 minutes.</p>

<p>I explained how (at current earthly understanding of physics,) a wind
turbine must spin (same as aircraft wings): thick leading edge and
thin trailing edge.</p>

<p>Also talked about van de Graaff generators.  Fun times!</p>

<p>The September 2016 NWTA event north of Houston has a staff application
deadline in 3 days.  The one for New Zealand (a week later) has a
staff deadline in August.  Given that travel to NZ is way less
expensive, plus I have more time to waffle, I think I&rsquo;ll forego
staffing in Houston and apply for New Zealand.  Plus I&rsquo;ve never been
there so it would be nice to visit!</p>

<p>I created a subdirectory in my git repo, initiated a git repo in it,
then added the subdirectory to the parent repo.  Boom it looks like
it&rsquo;s a submodule.</p>

<p>Hmm but wait it&rsquo;s not listed in the parent git repo&rsquo;s config file.  hmmm.</p>

<p>git is still neat.</p>

<p>Fujisawa is the last stop on this branch of the Odakyu Line.  (Another
terminal is Odawara.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not yet sure which trains pass which other trains by the time they
get to our station.</p>

<p>But at least I can easily get a seat if I want.</p>

<h2 id="19-50">19:50</h2>

<p>barf.  I would swear the sign said this train was going all the way to
Shinjuku, but now it&rsquo;s terminating in Sagami Ono.  What happened???</p>

<p>So just after writing the previous entry, I thought I can gain fake
internet points by writing (and updating) a mega-detailed(?) review of
the Burton bag which caught my eye today.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have pictures of the bag, but I do have questions, or one
burning question and a little question which I will compose here and
then email to burton customer service.</p>

<pre><code>Hello

I'm interested in your Wheelie Flyer, which I found at a Burton
outlet here in Japan.  It seems quite strong and holds all the
things I regularly want to carry.

I am a bit concerned about the wheels.  I walk about 4km daily on
rough asphalt.  How will the Wheelie Flyer's IXION wheels feel
about that? They seem easy enough to change, but I just wonder how
long they'll last.  I know it's nearly impossible to give a
number, but can you give me an idea of what they're designed to
handle?  I don't usually walk through gritty sand, but sometimes
through puddles of water, and sometimes across gravel.. and lots
of times across rough+sharp asphalt.

My other question involves water-proofedness.  I know the bags
aren't rated to be waterproof, but do you have / recommend a
waterproof cover that fits nicely on the Wheelie Flyer?

Thanks very much for your time
   - Rob


ps: I found this page when looking up the wheels

<p>After finishing the piece (though I haven&rsquo;t written its title on the
back), I walked toward the station.  Got to the coast-hugging highway
and looked left: &ldquo;oh hmmm wait a minute that looks like an shopping
outlet that just might have some nice bags.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So I walked over that way and saw a <em>trampoline</em> across the street
from the piace (would be great for a few free bounces, but they wanted
300 yen and I didn&rsquo;t have time to do 300 yen worth of flips).. so I
went to the outlet and boom, nice bags with lifetime warranty.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not a Briggs-Riley we&rsquo;ll fix it no matta what warranty, but the
bags look pretty dope, and they fit my shoes + computer + other
junk..  and Briggs-Riley ain&rsquo;t got outlets in Japan (that I&rsquo;ve
found)&hellip;  hmmmm</p>

<p>I mighta bought the bags then + there but I didn&rsquo;t have enough cash on
me.  I&rsquo;ll do a bit more research and may go back later.</p>

<p>Sat in the park and worked on the drawing which Yoko started.</p>

<p>I had drawn some yellow drops around her green Vs and one of the
yellow drops was all lopsided so I was like &ldquo;bluh&rdquo; and stopped drawing
for a while.</p>

<p>Like for over a month while we were busy with moving etc, and I just
didn&rsquo;t do anything on those pieces started by the GG class.</p>

<p>On Monday night, I shared some artspiration and my student and I both
agreed to work on our art, though we had each hit a wall of sorts.  I
was like, &ldquo;just make bad art&rdquo; and then the good art can come later.</p>

<p>Well, I ended up finishing the piece!  It&rsquo;s a bit sparse, but I think
it&rsquo;s got a big presence, describing a hierarchy of fractals.</p>

<p>Right after I got on the bus to head back to 新杉田駅, I noted that I
could walk there in just 2km.  Or, better yet, I could walk to 鳥浜駅,
which is even closer to where I need to go.  So I got off the bus
after a couple stops and walked toward 鳥浜駅.</p>

<p>Didn&rsquo;t get too far when I saw a park!</p>

<p>I went to the Yokohama immigration office to apply for my permanent
residency visa.  They suggested I <em>also</em> apply for an extension of my

visa expires.</p>

<p>So I applied for both.</p>
