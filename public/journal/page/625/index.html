<p><p>The ceiling fans in our new place had no light kits attached to
them.  In fact, the builder said they threw them all away cause they
were &lsquo;throw-away&rsquo; kits anyway.</p>

<p><p>Yesterday Wende and I bought a light kit at Home Depot.  I hooked
it up, screwed in a light bulb, but no light.  John is guessing they
didn&rsquo;t wire the fans correctly for lights.  Hmm.  We&rsquo;ll find out soon
enough.</p>

<p class=note>(written pre-phone)</p></p>

<p><p>Tonight ultimate was way more fun than this morning.  I had some
errors, but I got a lot more disc handling opportunities, and a much
higher percentage of good catches and throws.  Nothing way super crazy
astonishing, but just much greater feeling of goodness.  Thank you,
Saturday Night Specials.</p>

<p><p>Before Ultimate we visited Maggie and John&rsquo;s and had dinner while
watching The Sixth Sense on DVD.  Wende had never seen it.  When it
was in the theaters I did see it, but I told Wende it would be too
scary for her.  Enough of her friends said &ldquo;it&rsquo;s great; go see it&rdquo;
that she decided to risk ignoring my suggestion.</p>

<p><p>After the movie, I was all, &ldquo;okay, I&rsquo;m going to ultimate with
John,&rdquo; Wende was all, &ldquo;Oh no you&rsquo;re not!  You can&rsquo;t leave me all alone
after making me watch this scary movie!  I&rsquo;ll have nightmares!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Wende is so cute.</p>

<p><p>Maggie came up with a great plan to allow me to go.  John drove me
in his truck to ultimate, Maggie went with Wende to our house.  After
ultimate, John dropped me off, picked up Maggie.  Great plan.  Thank
you Maggie!!  You are brilliant.  :-)</p>

<p><p>Rocky, check this out:</p>

<p><p>Wende and I just met our across the street neighbors.  Dave, Ross,
Mike, Julie in some combination of living in a fourplex.</p>

<p><p>Walked over and they&rsquo;re brewing beer in the driveway.  I hung out
for an hour or so as they were boiling the sugar after straining it
from the mash.  It&rsquo;s actually quite an interesting process.  However,
this is one hobby into which I am consciously choosing never to invest
any time or money.</p>

<p><p>Gotta run; we&rsquo;re going to Maggie and John&rsquo;s for dinner.</p>

<p class=note>(written pre-phone)</p></p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m choosing not to attend General Assembly this year.  GA is great
great great great fun, and I&rsquo;ve been asked by youth to be their adult
sponsor&hellip; I really would love to go.</p>

<p><p>However, Wende and I are instead planning a trip to Australia in
February 2001.  We&rsquo;ll have to make and save some crazy mad cash, but
I&rsquo;m sure we can do it.  Jason and I ended up not going basically
because both of us were bums and had no jobs when we decided to go.
(We had plenty of time, but no money.)</p>

<p><p>This will be to attend the wedding of Wende&rsquo;s best friend from high
school Irene, to Nick, her Aussie boyfriend.</p>

<p><p>My mom&rsquo;s here!!</p>

<p class=note>(written pre-phone)</p></p>

<p><p>(we are still without a dail tone)</p>

<p><p>Ultimate was alright today but not great.  I had
<br>1 great defensive play,
<br>1 great catch (for a point),
<br>1 great miss-the-disc smackola right below my nose,
<br>1 all-out run leaping for the disc miss and tumble, bumping my head on the ground.</p>

<p><p>But Dave was grouchier today than previous days.  He&rsquo;s usually hard
on himself when he misses a catch or throw, but today he was yelling
at lots of people.  He never singled anyone out harshly by name, but
it made the game less enjoyable for me.  I don&rsquo;t love/know him enough
to explain that.. maybe I can tell him anyway.</p>

<p><P>My mom is coming over today!  Should be in about 15 minutes.  Wende
turned on House of Pain <em>Fine Malt Lyrics</em> CD, which is pumping
throughout the house.  That will certainly be turned down when Ma gets
here.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m at work early today, shifting my schedule to match Wende&rsquo;s 7am work schedule.  I haven&rsquo;t made the 7am mark, but I was here today at 8, fully 2 hours earlier than my 10:am and still not be <em>late</em>.</p>

<p><p>This is also good for me to gain some extra hours and be more likely to get 2 weeks off this summer for General Assembly and for Youth Council.</p>

<p><p>Yesterday we moved online a new version of our latest big project.  I rewrote much of the screen that lets people add people&rsquo;s names&hellip; This time there is lots of error-checking.  A lot of our time has been used in cleaning up bad data.  This will help a lot.</p>

<p><p>Today I may send out The Feel Good Net!  I copied it from linux to Windows formatted floppy so my Internet-enabled computer at work can send it.</p>

<p><p>Last night I wrote 2 journal entries which are patiently waiting in my linux box for a dial tone.</p>

<p class=date>4:09am CDT Friday 21 April 2000</p>
<p class=note>(written pre-phone)</p></p>

<p><p>I just woke up from a weird dream.  Several chronologically
disjointed pieces were combined.
<br>1) My (parents&rsquo;) house from when I was in 3rd - 7th grades.  This was 1977 to 1982.
<br>2) I used to be a mobile DJ - this was like 1995 or so.<br />
<br>3) The TV show Futurama.</p>

<p><em><p>I was asked by my ex ex ex ex boss if I could DJ for a wedding.  I
said no problem.</p>

<p><p>The day of the wedding arrived and I was at my dad&rsquo;s house, but it
was our old old house in which we lived when I was in 3rd to 7th
grade.  I recognized I needed to leave for my DJ gig when I realized a
few critical problems: 1) I did not still have the sound equipment. 2)
I did not still have my cumberbun.</em></p>

<p><p>In &lsquo;real&rsquo; life, I haven&rsquo;t had the sound equipment for years.
Probably 4 years.  I just gave away the cumberbun when we just moved.</p>

<p><em><p>There was also one other problem - I wanted to watch Futurama,
which had just started on TV.  The episode in my dream had a few funny
one-liners:</p>

<p><p>Bender and Fry were in a library searching for something that had
been left in a book in this library 1000 years ago.  The camera angle
showed Bender looking through books labeled &ldquo;Future&rdquo; and showed Fry
way across the room on the same row of books.</p>

<p><p>Fry said something and Bender retorts, &ldquo;well that&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m
looking in &ldquo;Future&rdquo; and you&rsquo;re way across the room looking in
&ldquo;Futurama.&rdquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Then the camera shifts and turns out Fry was right beside Bender,
but the first camera angle had been using a mirror on one wall of the
library.</p>

<p><p>The next scene was a combination of Simpsons and Futurama: Santa&rsquo;s
Little Helper </em>(Simpson&rsquo;s dog, for those who have other
priorities)<em> was chasing a hotdog on a string being tauntingly
pulled by Bender.  The hotdog fell into the sewer and Santa&rsquo;s Little
Helper went after it. He ended up lost in the sewer and in a big
cavern of a sewage pipe.  There were old cars and barrels of crude oil and other 20th century artifacts. The narrator made some comment about how the citizens of the 20th century had wastefully thrown all kinds of good stuff away and it still clogged the 30th century sewers.</p>

<p><p>So that was the first half of that episode of Futurama, and I had
to go do a DJ gig, but had no equipment, had no cumberbun, and turns
out I had no address of the wedding.</em></p>

<p><p>Then I woke up, much relieved.</p>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s 4:51am.  Good night again.</p>

<p><p>After Wende and I visited La Jaliscience for dinner, I called Dude.</p>

<p><p>Met him two blocks away at the old apartment, with the old couch
still on the grass by the street.</p>

<p><p>He dropped the tailgate on his little truck (small little 4 Runner or something) and we sized up the couch.  It looked to me like it wouldn&rsquo;t fit.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Should we measure it first?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Nah - it ain&rsquo;t that heavy, and I don&rsquo;t have a tape measure.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>We hefted it onto the tailgate.  Couch was too tall.  Tilted it
onto its back.  Still wouldn&rsquo;t fit.  Hmm.</p>

<p><p>Back down to the grass with the couch.</p>

<p><p>Maybe if we could just break the back off the couch, we could like
fold it over and fit it in that way.  I yanked on the cushion sewn to
the back and ripped it, spilling couch guts onto the grass.  That&rsquo;s
not going to work.</p>

<p><p>Maybe if we lay it onto its back, we can pull on the couchbed part
and crush the back with its weight.</p>

<p><p>This is my ten-year-old&rsquo;s dream!  Getting to climb on, rip up,
break to bits the couch that I&rsquo;ve been told for years to love and
protect.</p>

<p><p>(this is where the story gets funny.  get the visual here)</p>

<p><p>The couch is on its back in the grass.  Dude and I are each
standing on opposite corners of the back of the couch, alternately
yanking on the bottom of the couch, trying to get it to break.</p>

<p><p>Like pumping a railcar, we took turns torquing the couch, laughing
as traffic drove by this wacked out sight.  The couch creaked and
cracked, but didn&rsquo;t break.</p>

<p><p>We were laughing, &ldquo;what if a cop pulls up, &lsquo;Boyy, what are you
tryin&rsquo; to do to this here couch?&rsquo; or what if it breaks, we go flying
off and end up with stitches.  Wende would be all &lsquo;I thought you were
just going to move the couch.&rsquo; Veronica (Dude&rsquo;s wife is an MD) would
walk into the hospital, &lsquo;what are you doing here?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>We recognized that this 23 year old couch was too sturdy to break.
So we went back to plan A.</p>

<p><p>Dude&rsquo;s truck has the tailgate down and one end of a couch on it.
I&rsquo;m holding the other end while Dude straps it on with some big straps
he&rsquo;s got.  We yank these straps tight&hellip; and whaddayaknow - the couch
stays on.  It&rsquo;s sagging a bit, but easily 3 feet off the ground.</p>

<p><p>My friend Carrie was hanging from a phone line attached to an enemy
helicopter.  From the point of view of the helicopter, I could see her
suspended hundreds of feet below, sometimes she was able to touch the
ground with her feet, and sometimes she was pulled slightly into the
air.</p>

<p><p>My point of view switched to Carrie&rsquo;s as the phone line became
caught on some trees and eventually broke as the helicopter continued
to fly away.  Beside Carrie we watched with fear as the helicopter
came back and tried to shoot us, but only succeeded in cutting down
the branches of the tree that had caught the line.</p>

<p><p>The line was therefore unstuck and with no dream-time-lapse, we had
turned in the line as evidence to our military.</p>

<p><p>Fear again when a helicopter came flying toward us, but this time
it was a US Marine helicopter, coming to rescue us.  We were taken
aboard and inside the helicopter was huge like as big as the Starship
Enterprise.</p>

<p><p>To protect us, our identities had to be changed and we were to be
married.  But since I was already hitched to Wende, they had Carrie
marry Danny Glover (who made a guest appearance in the dream) and I
was to be their son.</p>

<p><p>The birth records and marriage records were forged to make this
official, and I was asked to learn a new signature to fit my new
identity.  I practiced forging my &lsquo;new&rsquo; signature and did a pretty
crappy job at it.  Then I woke up.</p>

<p class=note>(notes on dream characters)</p></p>

<p><p>As I wrote out my dream, I literally got to the second or third
reference to phone line and I was like, &ldquo;whoah - my phone line is not
hooked up.&rdquo;  That must be why a phone line appeared in my dream.</p>

<p><p>Carrie came down from Dallas for a convention last week; Wende
and I got to see her, and I got to see her again in my dream.</p>

<p><p>According to VIBE History of Hip Hop, Danny Glover used to be &ldquo;Kid Creole&rdquo; in one of the original old school groups.</p>
