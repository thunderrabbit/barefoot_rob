<p>Wow so great to be back in touch with Akiko!</p>

<p>I met her in EV back back in the day, and lost touch after I quit
working there and got busy etc etc, but today in the middle of getting
to Inbox Zero (I am cleaned out back to 2012 I think), I wrote to her
and she wrote back!</p>

<p>AND she says she is interested in teaching me Japanese, which I
believe I am more interested now than I was then.</p>

<p>AND AND she lives close to us!</p>

<p>Third lesson today was good; some of the students seemed to really
enjoy the cadence practice we did, focusing on matching the natural
native-speed rhythm of my speech.  Finally I have found something that
kinda gets their attention.  Mental note duly noted.</p>

<p>Maybe I will try it with my next class, but I kinda doubt it will have
the same effect.</p>

<p>The old code was this:</p>

<pre><code>$search_id = uniqid(UserAuthentication::getUserId());
</code></pre>

<p>Now it is this.</p>

<pre><code>switch ($report_id) {
    case '2':       // I have no idea how to fix this one
    case '5':       // contact edit page knows nothing of V2-style indices
    case '9':       // contact edit page knows nothing of V2-style indices
    case '10':      // uses `u` in query.  See SELECT * FROM `defined_reports` WHERE `dr_id` = 10
    case '11':      // uses `t` in query
    case '13':      // can probably fix if remove `u` from `query` SELECT * FROM `defined_reports` WHERE `dr_id` = 13
    case '16':      // can probably fix if remove `u` from `query`
    case '17':      // can probably fix if remove `u` from `query`
    case '18':      // can probably fix if remove `u` from `query
    case '19':      // can probably fix if remove `u` from `query
        $search_id_version = 1;
        $search_id = uniqid(UserAuthentication::currentUserId());
        break;
    default:
        $search_id_version = 2;
        $search_id = &quot;v2-&quot; . uniqid(UserAuthentication::currentUserId());
        $search_id_existed = 0;
        break;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am actually pretty glad I put it in code instead of
the DB because now at least I have notes regarding why each one is
here, and I have a sense of where to start looking to fix them.</p>

<p>I guess I can do this:</p>

<pre><code>switch ($report_id) {
    case '2':       // I have no idea how to fix this one
    case '5':       // contact edit page knows nothing of V2-style indices
    case '9':       // contact edit page knows nothing of V2-style indices
    case '10':      // uses `u` in query.  See SELECT * FROM `defined_reports` WHERE `dr_id` = 10
    case '11':      // uses `t` in query
    case '13':      // can probably fix if remove `u` from `query` SELECT * FROM `defined_reports` WHERE `dr_id` = 13
    case '16':      // can probably fix if remove `u` from `query`
    case '17':      // can probably fix if remove `u` from `query`
    case '18':      // can probably fix if remove `u` from `query
    case '19':      // can probably fix if remove `u` from `query
        $search_id_version = 1;
        break;
    default:
        $search_id_version = 2;
        break;
}

$search_id = &quot;v&quot; . $search_id . &quot;-&quot; . uniqid(UserAuthentication::currentUserId());
$search_id_existed = 0;
</code></pre>

<p>Because the version tester just looks for &ldquo;v(%d)+-&rdquo; at the beginning,
so old style uniqids like <code>115952d2ee60c79</code> and <code>v1-115952d2ee60c79</code>
will respond as type 1 ids.</p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>

<p>But I think really I am just losing my mojo for programming.</p>

<p>Back in high school I determed that emotions must be important.</p>

<p>Why do they stay available long after the cause is finished?  Not like
memories or scars which fade with time, but remain somehow somewhere,
available until we experience them.  I experienced this long after my
granddad died and smelled something that reminded me of him.  boom
crying crying tears even though I only vaguely remembered the thing he
gave me.</p>

<p>Like our bodies aparently refresh cells every 6 months or something to
keep them viable&hellip; is there some mechanism by which emotions are kept
viable?</p>

<p>Recently, I noticed another thing.  They (who?) say that we end up
marrying someone who was like our parents, possibly because we are
attracted to the same wounds we had as kids.  But why?</p>

<p>Maybe (and this is my theory) maybe we are driven toward people who
emotionally wound us in the same way so that we are given more chances
to heal the wounds.</p>

<p>If I need to deal with the sadness due to absent parents, I marry
someone who is emotionally unavailable..  so I have a chance to deal
with that sadness!  Isn&rsquo;t that convenient?  It makes me think
something like &ldquo;emotions are self healing&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;s not
that&hellip; &ldquo;emotions drive us toward behavior that triggers the emotions&rdquo;</p>

<p>more to come ?</p>

<p>Super great to find out there&rsquo;s neat park so close to our house!  I
had no idea how big it was, but there is a pavilion, museum, cool
sculpture, frisbee field, and more inside the park.</p>

<p>Met Kai in the station and chowed at Ootoya, because we were hungry
and not sure when everyone else was going to meet.  Shoulda asked
because first thing we did in the park was lay out a big spread of
food on blue tarp and chow.  I brought my camping chair which they
called the dad chair.</p>

<p>I have not yet seen Kai&rsquo;s great presentation, but I have been assured
it was great!  Soness coached her, so I know she received
compassionate knowledgable wisdom from a speaking pro!</p>

<p>I arrived just as the last speaker finished; I found the room because
I heard the applause from outside the door.</p>

<p>Lukas invited me in for the final picture, so we stood together in the
back.  He actually knew me from having been on TV earlier this year!</p>

<p>I also met his friend Rikako, who asked me about being barefoot, and
we thereby me Kiyoka and Daniel, who said they were eavesdropping on
our conversation.  I told them the whole story about being barefoot in
Houston and then being shod here before realizing no one would mind if
I were to be barefoot here.  I talked about my Pecha Kucha
presentation from last year (and got confused on the dates, thinking
my TV appearance was this February, but it was actually <em>last</em>
February (or so).  Anyway, they seemed interested so I told them about
and invited them to men&rsquo;s circle and co-gender circle respectively.</p>

<p>Rikako and Lukas are hosting a gathering this Saturday (near me and
Lin&rsquo;s house!) so I will join them there.</p>

<p>I gave a testimonial for Soness&rsquo;s coaching; I can still remember the
experience of preparing and presenting for Pecha Kucha as if it were a
recent event.  Kai did a testimonial as well; we could see she was
carrying herself with more confidence than before.  Apparently her
co-workers have recognized this as well.  So proud of her!</p>

<p>Two more lessons tonight and then zoom past Kawasaki station to
Rockwest(?) to see Kai after she speaks at Pecha Kucha in Kawasaki.
Unfortunately (if my students come), I won&rsquo;t be able to see her
speech.  The students always come though, so yeah.  Speaking of
whom.. gotta work.</p>
