<p><p>During my lunch, I zipped over to Rice to hang out
at the KTRU booth and read over the proposed document
that defines how KTRU will be made accountable to the
students of Rice University.  I made some suggestions
and gave them to Mike OC (who DJed with Lizzie T after
my Saturday shift) who will relay them at a meeting
tonight at 10:30pm.</p>

<p><p>Let it be known that I rode my (borrowed) unicycle
all the way from the stadium to the RMC and back!</p>

<p><p>At 2:35am, after sleeping a couple hours, my adrenaline was still
so high that I felt awake enough that it could be morning.  I asked
Wende if it was time to get up.  She told me the time and I did
finally sleep soundly.</p>

<p><p>Now I&rsquo;m going to Hansen College, who is loaning their PA equipment
for us to &ldquo;broadcast&rdquo; KTRU music within the RMC.  Super duper thanks
to Hansen College for their help!</p>

RELEASE:  00-190

EVIDENCE OF MARTIAN LAND OF LAKES DISCOVERED

     In what ultimately may be their most significant
discovery 
yet, Mars scientists say high-resolution pictures
showing layers of 
sedimentary rock paint a portrait of an ancient Mars
that long ago 
may have featured numerous lakes and shallow seas.

"We see distinct, thick layers of rock within craters
and other 
depressions for which a number of lines of evidence
indicate that 
they may have formed in lakes or shallow seas. We have
never before 
had this type of irrefutable evidence that sedimentary
rocks are 
widespread on Mars," said Dr. Michael Malin, principal
investigator 
for the Mars Orbiter Camera on NASA's Mars Global
Surveyor 
spacecraft at Malin Space Science Systems (MSSS), San
Diego, CA. 
"These images tell us that early Mars was very dynamic
and may have 
been a lot more like Earth than many of us had been
thinking."

Such layered rock structures where there were once
lakes are common 
on Earth. The pancake-like layers of sediment
compressed and 
cemented to form a rock record of the planet's
history.

The regions of sedimentary layers on Mars are spread
out and 
scattered around the planet. They are most common
within impact 
craters of Western Arabia Terra, the inter-crater
plains of 
northern Terra Meridiani, the chasms of the Valles
Marineris, and 
parts of the northeastern Hellas Basin rim. The
scientists compare 
the rock layers on Mars to features seen in the
American Southwest, 
such as the Grand Canyon and the Painted Desert of
Arizona.

"We caution that the Mars images tell us that the
story is actually 
quite complicated and yet the implications are
tremendous. Mars has 
preserved for us, in its sedimentary rocks, a record
of events 
unlike any that occur on the planet today," said Dr.
Ken Edgett, 
staff scientist at MSSS. "This is changing the way we
think about 
the early history of Mars -- a time perhaps more than
3.5 billion 
years ago."

"On Earth, sedimentary rocks preserve the surface
history of our 
planet, and within that history, the fossil record of
life. It is 
reasonable to look for evidence of past life on Mars
in these 
remarkably similar sedimentary layers," said Malin.
"What is new in 
our work is that Mars has shown us that there are many
more places 
in which to look, and that these materials may date
back to the 
earliest times of Martian history."

Malin added, "I have not previously been a vocal
advocate of the 
theory that Mars was wet and warm in its early
history. But my 
earlier view of Mars was really shaken when I saw our
first high-
resolution pictures of Candor Chasma. The nearly
identically thick 
layers would be almost impossible to create without
water."

As an alternative to lakes, Malin and Edgett suggest
that a denser 
atmosphere on early Mars could have allowed greater
amounts of 
windborne dust to settle out on the surface in ways
that would have 
created the sedimentary rock.

"We have only solved one little piece of a tremendous
puzzle," 
Malin said. "There is no illustration on the box to
show us what it 
is supposed to look like when it is completed and we
are sure most 
of the pieces are missing."

"These latest findings from the Mars Global Surveyor
tell us that 
more study both from orbit and at the surface is
needed to decipher 
the tantalizing history of water on Mars," said Dr.
Jim Garvin, 
Mars Exploration Program Scientist at NASA
Headquarters. "Our 
scientific strategy of following the water by seeking,
conducting 
in situ studies, and ultimately sampling will follow
up on these 
latest discoveries about Mars, and adapt to the new
understanding."

"Mars seems to continually amaze us with unexpected
discoveries," 
said Dr. Edward Weiler, Associate Administrator for
Space Science 
at NASA Headquarters. "This finding just might be the
key to 
solving some of the biggest mysteries on Mars, and it
also tells us 
that our new Mars exploration program needs the
flexibility to 
follow up in a carefully thought-out manner."

"The finding of layered sedimentary deposits is
something that 
biologists have been hoping for," said Dr. Ken
Nealson, director of 
the Center for Life Detection at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory 
(JPL), Pasadena, CA. "Perhaps the favorite sites for
biologists to 
search for fossils or evidence of past life on Earth
are layered 
lake or oceanic sediments such as in these sites Malin
and Edgett 
describe."

The Mars Global Surveyor mission is managed by JPL for
NASA's 
Office of Space Science, Washington, DC. Malin Space
Science 
Systems built and operates the camera system. Lockheed
Martin 
Astronautics, Denver, CO, developed and operates the
spacecraft.

<p><p>We got the booth set up today at 8am and I hung out there until 9am
to make sure all went smoothly.  Everything seemed fine when I left; I
have every reason to believe the booth is still running perfectly.</p>

<p><p>Working and trying to resist watching all the emails fly by, I got
some work done, but did not move any of it online.</p>

<p><p>As Kevin left, he said he has been &ldquo;extremely pleased&rdquo; with how
well the Ritz project has gone.  We have gotten zero errors in the
logs. Awesome!</p>

<p><p>Finally at 7:30 I emailed to Kevin the status of the work: nothing
has changed, but I&rsquo;m going home to sleep and wake up early and work.</p>

<p><p>Special super duper thanks to Wende for taking a couple pictures of
my cool bumper sticker.  We caravanned to Rice&rsquo;s stadium parking lot,
so the pictures could include the stadium in the background.  It was
overcast, so the camera used the flash; the license plate might
reflect back brightly, but I&rsquo;m hopin&rsquo; the sticker will be visible.</p>

<p><p>Today my schedule includes</p>

<p><p>9:00am  pick up prints of pictures mentioned above</p>

<p><p>scan the pics and email them to the webmaster of <a

<p><p>1:00pm  Rally planning meeting for YRUU at church</p>

<p><p>4:00pm  Receive phone call from Kevin to coordinate a time to meet
him this evening at work</p>

<p><p>after that: install NAIC software on Wende&rsquo;s computer.</p>

<p><p>The last two items are a result of me losing my access card to the

Subject: [savektru] RALLY INFO


Everyone is encouraged to copy this message and send
it to everyone who
might be remotely interested.  Don't worry too much if
you think that
others may already have sent this message to the same
group.  For the 
rally 
tomorrow, there can't be too much effort made.

****************************

KTRU, a wholly student operated & student funded radio
station for 30
years, has been shut down by the administration of
Rice University.  
The
reason is simple; the administration wants KTRU to
play more sports, 
but
the station and the student body reject this.  In
order to get what 
they
want the administration has resorted to force and
deceit.  Get the 
facts
at: https://www.savektru.org/

Then show up for a RALLY on the center quad of Rice
campus:

Monday, December 4, 2000 4:30 pm

This will be an organized rally with faculty and
student speakers.  We
expect a very large turn out with lots of media
attention.

Ktru has the support of virtually the entire Rice
campus, now we need

<p class=date>10:46pm CST Sunday 3 December 2000</p>

<p><p>I checked my work email and found messages indicating a couple of
changes that needed to be made to the French text on a couple of
images.  Fixed them with The Gimp (The Gnu Image ManiPulator) and got
them on the site.</p>

<p><p>Then picked up pix from walgreens and scanned them at Kinko&rsquo;s.
Emailed them from Kinko&rsquo;s to the webmaster of <a
href="https://www.savektru.org">www.savektru.org</a>; maybe they&rsquo;ll be
on that site soon.</p>

<p><p>Picked up flyers at Rice and then went to Rally planning meeting.
Meeting was great and productive; we pretty much know what groups will
do what jobs.</p>

<p><p>Cool.</p>

<p><p>Then chilled out for a bit and then stopped by work before saying
HI to peeps at Rice and coordinating how we will set up the new KTRU
Booth tomorrow at 7:30am.</p>

<p><p>Home to a lovely dinner of ravioli and then watched Futurama,
Simpsons and Malcom in the Middle with Wende.</p>

<p><p>Yay!</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m guessing that they found evidence primitive
life (bacteria or worms) currently alive on mars, or
evidence of more advanced life no longer alive on
mars.</p>

<p class=date>11:02pm CST Saturday 2 December 2000
<p class=note>(this will probably be just random thoughts from today)</p>

<p><p>A meeting was held for people &ldquo;who want to do something, but don&rsquo;t
know what to do&rdquo; for KTRU.  I attended and subsequently helped with
the &ldquo;Booth Committee,&rdquo; designed simply to get a booth set up on Rice
campus where DJs can continue to play music, even if we are not being
broadcast.  This is a symbolic act (we just want to play music), and a
way to have a booth continually staffed where people can learn more
about the whole ordeal.</p>

<p><p>We plan to start Monday morning at 8am.  That means that I &ldquo;missed&rdquo;
my KTRU shift today at 7pm.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>I wrote to the owners of ktru.com, who have that domain for sale,
asking if they would let us borrow it.  They would benefit by this
because once we give it back, they should get an excess of hits after
the fact.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m bummed that I missed the funeral for Phat Pat and Emily&rsquo;s mom
today.  I totally just forgot about it, with all the KTRU craziness
going on.  Bluh.  I didn&rsquo;t know her, but I know Patrick and Emily.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>I am finally caught up with all the KTRU email messages that have
been sent over the past 3 days.  I&rsquo;m sure there have been easily 300
messages sent.</p>
