<p class=date>(3 may 1987)</p>

<p>I'm mostly going to skip this whole week.  I remember there was one
thing I wanted to write but I don't remember it.  SHIT.  Lucy locked
my Ring Monday.  My official Junior class ring was locked on Monday,
April 27, 1987.  Right in front of Christina, too.  Lucy kissed me
right in front of her.  I wonder what Christina thought. I did my
Spanish project on Friday.  It was pretty good, I guess.  After
school Friday, Me and Fred packed the van for the weekend.  Then I
drove to pick up dad.  Then I went to work.  Then we went to Camp
Hollygrove for the 3rd annual Northwoods Unitarian Society Spring
Retreat.  We got there at about 11:00.  Emily and Cheri met me on the
way over to the main building.  We hugged and went in.  We all played
Ping pong and Fooz ball (the table soccer game)  We messed around
outside.  There was a trampoline and a slide and a barrel and a merry
go round with excellent berings.  I want to draw everything:</p>

<pre>
                       
  TRAMPOLINE       
  __________ cover 
  |        |          |     BARREL      |  The barrel was
  |        |          |     ______      |  cool.  We jumped
__|--mat---|___       |    /      \     |  in and would run
  |________|          |   /  /  \  \    |  in it.  It turned
    ^                 |  |   \__/   |   |  but didn't go
   hole               |   ----------    |  anywhere.

</pre>

<p>The barrel was just big enough for me to get in and stand.  The
NUTS were to have our own cabin.  It was me and Cheri and Emily and
Jessy.  That's all.  I was excited about sleeping alone with them.
But my dad informed us that he was also sleeping there.  I was all
like Fucking Shit Yuk Man about that.  The 4 of us put our mattresses
on the floor together.  So we all slept together.  We slept at about
2:30.  Woke up at about 8:00.  We/I ate breakfast, went across a 3
wire bridge across lake, built kites, built a blow gun, played hackey
sack, went around in rowboats, splatter painted, went for a walk,
played ping pong, etc.  Then we had the Truly Tacky Talent Show.  I
was in 5 different things in it. <b>1:</b> I helped the little kids
sing a song. <b>2:</b> Fred and I sat in chairs as if it were a car
seat.  I drove.  We went flying around, past trees, over a ramp, and
almost into a brick wall.  But the quarter ran out just in time.  At
the very first, we sat down and I said, are you ready kid?  Fred said
Yeah and I slid on some mirrored shades.  I looked so awesome.
Everyone thought I looked tought - so cool, man.  O.K. <b>3:</b> I did
a thing with Zach and Kevin.  I was like the M.C.... The rapper.  I
said, "One bright day in the middle of the night, these two best
friends decided to fight.  They went back to back to face eachother,
pulled out their swords and shot eachother.  The two deaf cops heard
the noise.  They came out and killed the two dead boys.  If you don't
believe this to be true, just ask the blind man, he saw it too."
Kevin and Zach acted the whole thing out.  It went without a flaw.
Perfect.  All the way through. It was great. <b>4:</b> Me Zach and
Kevin sang <em>Lean on Me</em>. About 1/2 way through, Fred came out
and Leaned on us.  We all fell over.  <b>5:</b> Me and Emily sang the
Yogi Bear Song - "I know someone you don't know, Yogi, Yogi," - That
one.  We even sang the bisexual part.  It was cool.  After the show,
the kids played outside for a while.  Then we came in and played ping
pong.  People started going to sleep.  The NUTS stayed.  Fred fucking
stayed, too.  The little asshole. He wouldn't leave.  'Bout piss me
off.  NUTS, Fred, and a dude named Dan stayed and played cards.  I
told the koosh joke. *40 Minutes*.  It was great.  I'll have to write
to Shawn and tell him.  At about 4:00, we went out on the boats.  The
entire time, I had visions of Jason jumping up out of the water at
me.  I figured if I was scared, They will be too, so I told everyone.
We went in soon after that.  Fred left for bed.  Me and Cheri played
ping pong.  We went to sleep at about dawn.  6:30.  We slept 'till
10:00.  We had lunch and listened to a guided meditation by Byron.  It
started raining.  Cheri and I ran out in the rain.  That was fun.  I
like being with her.  Just one on one.  She is <b>cool</b>.  We will
be friends forever.  We jumped on the trampoline.  Water came up
through it.  That was fun.  We were totally drenched.  Everyone packed
and left.  I got home at about 5:00.  I accidentally left my folder
there.  It had my pre-diary stuff from this weekend in it.  And it had
Bryn's letter to me in it.  SHIT.  Kelly called me when I got home.
We talked about nothin' for a while.  She's going to Houston Rally but
not GA.  I am happy.  She is going to SWUUSI.  Yeah baby I got my
nights filled, now.  That's about it.  Goodnight 10:50PM May 3.</p>

<p class=date>10:40 Wednesday the 29 of April, 1987.</p>

<p>The Rally was awesome.  Cheri had fun.  I am glad.  Debbie Wagner
went with me and mom there.  When we got to the hotel, no youth were
around.  They had gone to the youth hopitality houses.  Debbie found
Rusty Cockrell's room.  (he is sort of out of the teen group) We
talked some and then Cheri & Emily came.  We talked and then me,
Debbie, Em and Cheri went to the girls' hospitality house.  There was
no youth there, either.  Finally someone came.  David Garvoille,
Deborah Dixon, Gail Kean.  Then the rest came who had already gotten
there and gone on a walk.  Ginnie Kilgore, Alisa Velonis, Mike Alves,
Shawn McDaniel, and some new people.  Bryn, Katie, Janine, and some
guys.  We talked till about 12:00.  Then the guys went to our house.
We were up until about 2.  I slept on the floor.  Woke up at about
7:30.  Took a shower, ate, and we left for the hotel.  Ginnie did a
workshop: 1/2 of the group asks questions, and other 1/2 answers.
Then we went out by the pool.  Only me, Alva, and Ginnie swam.  I
found out that lemon peel tastes rather sweet after eating a lemon.
[From my memory as I transcribe my own entry: this is the time that
Ginnie was rubbing lemon juice on her leg hairs to bleach them.  "Turn
blonde, you fuckers!"  So funny!] Then we had lunch.  Then we all went
for a walk.  All 20 or so of us jaywalked a busy street.  That was
funny.  We just took our time.  Sorta bee-boppin' across- just
jammin'.  We went to a miniature shopping mall.  We went into Photon.
That has to be the biggest rippoff.  There was no way we were going to
play.  There was a meeting going on when we came back.  I sat by
Emily, Cheri, Ginnie, & Christina.  The meeting was very boring.
David Garvoille had some fizzy pop things.  When you put them in your
mouth, they pop like rice krispies.  Ginnie put a ton of them in her
mouth and I could easily hear her.  Then the speaker up front said
something incredibly dumb.  Everyone started cracking up and I thought
that would be a good time to tell Ginnie that she sounded like a bowl
of rice krispies.  I turned around and they both (Christina and
Ginnie) started totally cracking up.  Later they said I had the
funniest look that said "why did she say that?"  Whatever.  The three
of us left after that.  We had to go to the YAC meeting.  Before that
Ginnie went to change her clothes.  I went with her.  She didn't have
a key to the room they were in.  So she called a janitor who happened
to be on the floor.  He opened the door for us with no question.  We
could have done it for <em>any</em> room at all.  Talk about loose
security!  Then we went to the YAC meeting.  We voted on how YRUU
would spend money this year.  We also decided the fate of people who
do drugs or alcohol at rallies.  On the first offense, they are sent
home, and suspended from rallies for a year.  On the second time, they
are sent home and will never come to another rally.  Ginnie was
telling us about some cases of drugs from Dallas and drinking at
SWUUSI. The whole time she was saying no names, no names.  The reason
being that she was one of the people who drank at SWUUSI.  I hope she
doesn't get caught.  We also voted on people to be on the YAC
committee.  I was nominated, and gave my little speech, which Ginnie
liked, but I didn't make it.  I was surprised, but not too upset.
Then we got ready for the river cruise.  I almost went with someone
that I don't know if I could strust to keep out of trouble.  It was
probably going to be daring for me.  But, I ended up not going with
her.  I went instead with another guy and a whole bunch of girls.  We
went in a van.  He sat in front.  Wow.  I messed around the whole way
up there.  I'm going to make this short.  I am a week behind in this.
We went on the boat ride and I ended up with Bryn Watkins.  We went
back to the guys' hosue.  All of the teens.  Then Me, Bryn, and 3
other people went to get movies.  I sat in the back and Bryn lay back
on me.  We got The Fly, Eddie Murphy - Delerious, and The Terminator.
Either The Fly or Eddie Murphy was best.  Terminator was just sensless
killing.  Bryn was right beside me through all 3.  The Fly was not as
incredibly gross as I had heard. Some parts were pretty funny. After
the movies, the girls left.  I stayed up with Shawn McDaniel until
about 4:30.  We told jokes and he signed my tie dye shirt.  He told me
these Jokes: Koosh, Thank God, Don't Do it Again, and some Nun jokes.
I told him: Pink Gorilla, Ping Pong Balls, Frayed Not, Unitarians,
Only ones here.  I woke up at about 7:50, took a shower, and we left
for the hotel.  We went to the sanctuary and got some pictures.  We
went outside for closing circle.  We took pictures and sang.  (I need
to write some of the songs down).  We went to the sermon.  The guy up
front said he had a story and any kids could come up if we wanted.
All of us went up there.  After the sermon, we packed, hugged, kissed,
got/gave addresses, hugged, kissed, took pictures then we left.  I
kissed Bryn last.  That was the first time I kissed her.  I doubt we
will do anything.  We saw Janine and Katie on the way home.  We ate in
Lafayette together.  That was nice.  Janine has beautiful eyes.  Katie
was looking pretty, too.  They both have great smiles.  And that was
my Baton Rouge Rally.  It was great.</p>

<p class=date>Thursday 11:15</p>

<p>Rally tomorrow!  I am happy!  It's weird, I'm not totally excited
about it as the OKC Rally.  I know it will be at least as awesome
though.  I just finished getting ready for it.  I will wear 3
bracelets to school tomorrow.  I am going to wear Jams too.  People at
school have started wearing bracelets similar to the ones we made at
SWUUSI.  It's pretty cool.  I've got 2 small ones and One huge turkey.
I may buy two regular ones at school tomorrow.  It's Cheri's first
Rally tommorow.  I hope she has fun- She will I'm sure.  She's worried
though.  I can dig it, too.  I will be there if she needs it.

<p>Rally coming up.  I am happy.  It almost seems too soon for
another, but I guess I can handle it.  Christina is still messed up
cause I broke up.  She came over to me during lunch because she
thought I looked lonely.  She sat down and told me how she was all sad
and stuff.  She wasted my whole lunch hour.  Today we had outdoor
lunch for an hour.  All the students at once.  I was sitting on the
sidewalk, completely content, waiting for someone to pull out a
frisbee or football or hackeysack or something.  While I waited, I
watched the skateboard clique.  They were doing some awesome junk.
Going up and down the curb, jumping over other boards and/or people,
doing handstands, and a whole bunch of shit.  Mr. Cowan watched them
the entire time.  Either he was impressed or he was expecting a wrong
move.  A dude took pictures of them.  It was totally great.  Then
Christina came and I just sat and talked to her the rest of the time.
Boring.  Total waste.  She is getting better though.  Cheri called
today.  She is all nervous about the Rally.  It's her first.  She is
afraid Emily will leave her all alone.  I promised to stick with her.
I told her how much fun she would have.  She was impressed when I said
you'll feel like you've known 'em for a year.  She was like "you get
to know 'em that fast?"  I said Yeah.  She brightened up at that
throught. Then we started talking about Astroworld and all the rides.
She is afraid to ride the Cyclone, Greezed Lighting, and the Looping
Starship.  I will fix that.  I am looking forward to going to
Astroworld with her. 10:20</p>

<p>In Spanish, Rob and Neil had Dean film them in Safeway.  It was
hilarious.  In one part, they walked right up to the camera, and then
the scene changed to them walking away from it.  They were stopped by
a freezer, and pulled ice cream, oreo's, peanut butter, and stuff out
of there.  And Rob was by the beer shelves and said
abra-cadabra. Instantly, a case of beer appeared in each hand.  As
they were leaving, they had a giant cartful.  Neil said "you want all
this?" Rob said "Nah." so they turned around.  The End.  I guess you
had to be there.  10:20</p>

<p>I just decided to write my dreams in something.  But not this book
(which still needs a name).  That's all 8:45</p>

<p>I broke up with Christina.  She was all sad and everything.  She
said "It won't be the same." all the time.  I'm glad I did it, but I'm
sorry it hurt her.  I hope she gets over it soon.  I got a letter from
Kelly today.  It was short.  From what I read, she has a troubled
life.  Her parents are always after her, there's an abundance of cuss
words in it,... etc.  I'm really sorry about that.  Yesterday Dave
came over.  He had literally fought/wrestled with Woody.  I told him
that he shouldn't live like that, and should seek help.  I hope he
thinks about it.  I went my letter to Kelly today.  It was 5 pages
long.  I sent her ring and bracelet too.  her bracelet smelled great
while I had it.  Dad got my slides back from the rally.  I will
<b>never</b> use fucking slides again.  Only for like scenery and
shit.  Not people.  It just doesn't work.  Night Night. 11:55</p>

<p class=date>Friday</p>

<p>I wrote the last 4 pages of this big thing.  All the way back to
the marker on page 12.  I've been lying around all day.  Except when I
went to the Dr.  I have strep throat.  Since yesterday I've been
hurting.  Well, it's 3:17 P.M. on Friday and I caught up with my
life.</p>

<p class=date>Thursday</p>

<p>forget yesterday, except Erin layed back on me on the bus.  I told
her about the rally.  I told her that I disobeyed a rule: that I
fucked Kelly.  I just wanted to.  Today I wrote a 5 page letter to
Kelly.  I'll send it tomorrow, along with the ring and bracelet.  No
school tomorrow.</p>

<p class=date>Tuesday.</p>

<p>I talked to Lynda Smith in the library a little.  She was looking
at some stuff about the different Astrological signs.  She said she
didn't know any Aires, and I corrected her.  We read about her sign,
Virgo, then mine.  We flirted the whole time.  Mom taught again in
history.  Candie Downy put her leg in my lap.  That was interesting.
After school, I caught up in typing.  I also watched the cheerleaders
practice.  I am almost glad I didn't make it.  They are doing some
tough stuff.  Christina was with me when I watched.  And every time I
smiled, she would ask me why.  The girl is paranoid.  I have got to
break up soon.  Dad had a good way to.  He told me to say she holds me
too tight.  I will do that.  After school, at about, 10:00 I printed
my research paper at Shirley Broussard's.  I got it done and I was
happy.</p>
