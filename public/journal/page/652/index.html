                        <p class=note>(written from notes in my little yellow diary that Bryn and Eryn gave me)</p>
<p class=date>1 May 1999</p>

<p><p>Today Jen and I went to Astroworld!</p>

<p><p>She had never been to the park, and hasn&rsquo;t ridden any coasters in quite a while, so we were both happy to go.  First stop was by the Serial Thriller, where we took lots of pics of the construction.  The ride looks supa phat; I&rsquo;m more excited about it opening than I am about Star Wars!  Jen decided she&rsquo;ll just have to come back this summer to ride it!</p>

<p><p>Our first stop was Viper, the line for which was pretty much super long. The wait didn&rsquo;t seem so long as we just talk talk talked.  Viper is super smooth and compact!  Including a loop and three circuits around the 1 or 2 acre area, Viper is the coolest coaster I know that could fit in my dad&rsquo;s yard!</p>

<p><p>I remember when it was first built (1989) and I was there on opening day.. Amazing!  I was so happy with the ride that I built a topologically accurate model of it out of posterboard.  The model is not all that amazing, except that my dad still has it in my old room closet.</p>

<p><p>Then toward XLR8, but the line was too long for me to want to ride it.  So to Greezed Lightnin&rsquo; we walked.  Soon as we got there, people were being turned back; ride was broke.  Doh!  So back to XLR8.</p>

<p><p>While we were in line for XLR8, the people who had been right in front of us on Viper exited XLR8.  They hadn&rsquo;t made a dead-end trip to Greezed Lightnin&rsquo;.</p>

<p><p>We rode in the front, which is pretty much the best seat on the train.  XLR8 is a suspended coaster, the first(?) of its kind.  Riders&rsquo; feet do not dangle like the newest suspended coasters, but it&rsquo;s still pretty fun to have the cars swing way out above the tall reeds.  I have heard rumors that XLR8 will be the next coaster to be replaced at Astroworld.</p>

<p><p>So anyway, we rode in front and then went to Greezed Lightnin&rsquo; again, since we saw it was running while we were on XLR8.</p>

<p><p>Soon as we got there, people were being turned back; ride was broke.  We decided to stay this time, waited for the crowd to disperse and walked up to nearly the front of the line for the back seats.  Met two guys in line, Carl and Brady, who were here from New Orleans.  Carl is a coaster enthusiast like me, but has ridden more rides than I, unlike me.  We talked rides and what&rsquo;s cool and whatever, and he told us about a new park being opened in New Orleans in Spring 2000.  <a href="https://www.jazzland2000.com" target="_new">Jazz Land</a> should be a pretty cool park!</p>

<p><p>Oh, I should certainly mention by now that Jen used to be a ride operator at <a href="https://www.canobie.com">Canobie Lake Park</a> up in New Hampshire. So she had some fun cool stories that neither Carl nor I had experienced.</p>

<p><p>Talking to the ride operator of Greezed Lightnin&rsquo;, turns out the brakes were not tight enough to stop the train properly, so they were tightening them.  It only took like 20 minutes, which is easily way less time than we would have spent waiting otherwise, plus now Jen and I had new friends!</p>

<p><p>Carl and Brady rode in the back, then Jen and I rode in the back, and the lines hadn&rsquo;t formed yet, so we rode again a couple seats up. Yay!  Greezed Lightnin&rsquo; is a basic shuttle loop coaster, catapults out of station, loops, goes up a hill, then backwards through loop, back through station, up a hill, then back down again into station.  35 seconds at most.</p>

<p><p>Carl and Brady waited for us at the exit, and Jen saw that Texas Tornado was running!!  With riders!!  We had previously skipped this latest newest greatest ride because it wasn&rsquo;t open (though there was a significant line).</p>

<p><p>So at super high speed walk we zipped over to the ride and talk talk talked while waiting.  Carl talked a lot about the cool rides at Six Flags Great America, and I was quite ecstatic to think I would be there next week!  Amazing!  We couldn&rsquo;t think of the name of the newest biggest ride there, but yeah, lots to talk about.</p>

<p><p>Waited for Texas Tornado (it used to be named after the Looney Toons character: Taz&rsquo;s Texas Tornado, and I inquired about the change.  &ldquo;Did you lose a license with Looney Toons to use the name?&rdquo;  &ldquo;No, they decided not to use a name that would scare little kids,&rdquo; was the reply from a ride operator.  &ldquo;What????&rdquo;) and Jen took some primo pics of it while we were in line.</p>

<p><p>While in line, I showed them how at one point in the track, as the train is just finishing a loop, the track moves to accomodate the mass and literally shakes the ride operator booth!  We loved watching the booth go shakeshakeshake as the train whoooshed by. Coincidentally, at that moment in the track, a camera takes pictures of everyone on the train.  The pictures were offered for sale for like $7 as people left.</p>

<p><p>Finally it was our turn to ride.  Jen and I rode the front seat of the last car.  This seat is often one of my favorites; I get the thrill of being in the last car, but a get a good view by being in a front seat.</p>

<p><p>The ride is awesome.  Up the curved incline to begin, then a false start then, zzzooooommmmm so incredibly steep curved down immediately through two loops.  Then up through a braking section then zzzoooomm down again through a cork screw, then around and up and down and another cork screw right where our pictures are taken, I pointed at the ride op booth, screamed, &ldquo;SHAKE BABY SHAKE!!&rdquo; and then around one more shaky banked curve then slow then done.</p>

<p><p>WOW!!!   I love that ride!  Waved to the crowd in line, waved to the people in the station, the ride ops, everyone.  I love it!</p>

<p><p>I checked out the picture for sale.  I look possessed, pointing over at the booth, shouting something crazy.  Bought it.</p>

<p><p>Waited for Brady and Carl to ride, then walked toward Batman The Ride.  They had already ridden, so they went to eat and we parted ways.  I got Carl&rsquo;s email address, so I&rsquo;ll write him when this entry is done.</p>

<p><p>The line for Batman was super long; we had to wait through almost the entire themed area, the Penguin&rsquo;s Arctic Park, then through construction and disarray of Gotham City, all privately funded by Mr Cobblepot.</p>

<p><p>Front car of Batman is an absolute must.  I don&rsquo;t care in which seat I ride, but I have to ride in front after waiting all that time to ride.  The train is about 7 cars long, 4 seats across per car.  Hugely careening through the track this train sounds like a jet almost.  It&rsquo;s amazing.  Out of the station up the click click click, I pulled out my cell phone to call Wende. No answer. I tried both her numbers and pretty much used up about half the ride listening to the phone ring.  That was cool.  Worth the irony of having been able to shout, &ldquo;GUESS WHAT??? WE&rsquo;RE ON BATMAN!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Too bad she didn&rsquo;t answer.</p>

<p><p>After Batman, we rode Ultra Twister.  The line was super long, but I wanted to ride so Jen could experience it.  Talking with Jen and taunting back and forth with two kids (they started it by tapping on my shoulder as they went by, then pretending not to have done it) helped the line waiting experience.</p>

<p><p>Got on, and the car began its ascent <em>click click click click click click click CLUNk</em> we stopped.</p>

<p><p>Jen and I were in the front seat, behind us were two adult types, behind them (last seat) were two kids affiliated in some manner with the two adults.</p>

<p><p>The kids asked worriedly, &ldquo;why are we stopped?&rdquo;  &ldquo;is there something wrong?&rdquo;  &ldquo;when will we go again?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>None of these were questions that could be very well answered, so we made up delicously vague or teasingly scary answers.  Eventually, it became apparent that &ldquo;soon&rdquo; was not the correct answer to any of these questions except maybe, &ldquo;when will someone come see us?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Jeremy came to see us.  A ride op for Ultra Twister, he said basically, &ldquo;the chain stopped, we&rsquo;ll get it going in a little bit.  Hopefully.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Another ride op climbed the steps to tell the same thing to the people stopped at the top of the lift.</p>

<p><p>We joked back and forth and then I was all, &ldquo;hey hey hey can you go get Jen&rsquo;s camera so we can take a picture of this?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>We told him where it was and he got it and Jen took a pic of the people above us.</p>

<p><p>Uh-oh.  Wende!  We were late to meet her!  I pulled out my cell phone and called her.  &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Where are you??&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re on Ultra Twister.  Stuck on Ultra Twister to be precise..&rdquo;  I told her how to come to the entrance of Batman where she would be able to see us.  We waved back and forth once she got there and I called her again.  &ldquo;Hey, if we give you Jen&rsquo;s camera, will you take a picture of us?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Negotiating how to get her the camera, then actually getting it to her, then having Wende get back to her spot, and teaching her how to use the camera (manual), took longer than it took for us to get unstuck.  No picture.</p>

<p><p>Oh well.</p>

<p><p>The ride was great, with its ups and downs and twists, starts and stops, fowards and backwards, but no turns.</p>

<p><p>We were greeted by Wende at the end.  Oh!  and there&rsquo;s our friends who we were teasing with in line.  &ldquo;You got stuck on it??&rdquo; they asked wide eyed.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yup,&rdquo; I said proudly.  &ldquo;Have a great day!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Then we went to Looping Starship.  This is a ride that gripped Wende&rsquo;s heart, mind, body with great fear.  She had her reasons, and they were understandable, but I encouraged, taunted, begged, consoled, whatever it took to get her to ride it.</p>

<p><p>I love the ride.  I let my leg dangle down while we were upside down, and a couple of people in line waved to me.  Great fun.</p>

<p><p>Afterward Wende said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s something I would do again.  I enjoyed it, and it was probably not worth all my boycotts for all those years.  But it&rsquo;s scarier than a roller coaster to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Then, the ultimate.  We debated for a while, &ldquo;should we pay the extra money?  well, we&rsquo;re already here.  won&rsquo;t get many chances to do it.  but it&rsquo;s $45. do we have enough?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>The Barnstormer is a ride where they wrap riders in big cloth tamales, tie them to a cable, pull them up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up, then the riders drop and SWWWWOOOSSHHHHH way down and SWIIINNNGGG way up and it&rsquo;s a thrill.  I&rsquo;ve never done it.</p>

<p><p>We did it. The line was short but took a long time. While Jen and Wen waited, I went and bought ice cream for me and Jen, a pretzel for Wende.  I finished my ice cream before I had gotten Wende&rsquo;s pretzel so I bought an ice cream sandwich or something there.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hurry!  Hurry!!&rdquo;  they were calling as I got back.  We hogged down the food and got wrapped in tamales.  Actually they were like big complicated smocks with leg straps and foot holders. We went down the walkway to wait a tad longer before our time to fly.</p>

<p><p>In front of us were a couple of high school-ish aged youth, including one named Marlin who was super duper nervous about the whole thing.  Wende was totally sympathetic; they made nervous jokes and stuff while I just stood excitedly watching everything.</p>

<p><p>When it was their turn, we cheered them on as they were strapped to the cable in their tamales.  Up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up they went higher higher higher with Marlin yelling gentle obscenities the whole way.</p>

<p><p>Once they reached the top, the ride op person spoke over the intercom, &ldquo;fliers ready; 3 - 2 - 1 - fly&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>And one of them pulled the little cord and they dropped.  Marlin yelled.  They flew past us, flew up, flew back&hellip;  the biggest coolest swing in the world and they were swinging big.</p>

<p><p>Marlin quit yelling frightenedly and yelled triumphantly!  &ldquo;YEEEAAAHHAHAHAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!&rdquo;  We cheered him on.</p>

<p><p>They finished, got off the swing, we got on and exactly the same thing happened except it was Wende instead of Marlin.</p>

<p><p>Going up, I was being all teasing and Wende almost cried. I felt bad, but a bit gyped since she didn&rsquo;t let me put my arms out.  I could have, but man when she cried I figured she was really scared.</p>

<p><p>We kept going up, and I got a tad nervous. Wow ..  we&rsquo;re getting pretty high up here..  We stopped at the top.  Now I know what 173 feet feels like.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;3 - 2 - 1 - fly&rdquo; and we dropped.</p>

<p><p>Wow.</p>

<p><p>From 0 to 70 at 9.8 meters per second squared and we missed the ground by 10 feet as we flew up over the water and back down and up and down and wow.  I yelled triumphantly, Jen did her Tarzan impression, and Wende enjoyed it after recognizing she was still alive.</p>

<p><p>Totally like flying we swung for as long as possible; I tried to hold the girls&rsquo; hands back so we wouldn&rsquo;t catch the rope they used to slow us down.  So much fun.</p>

<p><p>Then to the Texas Cyclone where the line was long but bearable after all the excitement, though my legs were pretty tired after standing up all day.  I rode in the first seat in the back car and Wen and Jen rode together after that.  It was fully dark outside, so a fun ride watching the lights.  I honestly don&rsquo;t remember much about it, but I know I yelled happily and held my hands up high.</p>

<p><p>Waited for Wen and Jen and then we rode Dungeon Drop.  This is a ride that simply takes riders straight up and drops them straight down for about 2.5 seconds of freefall.  Maybe 2 seconds.</p>

<p><p>The park was closing so we were ushered toward the exit.  What a super duper fabulous fun day!</p>

                        <p class=date>1:30am Wednesday 28 april 1999</p>

<p><p>This week Jen is in town from New Hampshire!  This is part two of the climate exchange program, where I went to NH in February to experience something a tad cold, and she&rsquo;s here in Houston now to experience something a tad warm.  She&rsquo;s also going to apply for grad school at Rice.</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;ve been happily busy.  On Monday I substituted for Aline on KTRU from 11am to 1pm, and Jen helped choose music and helped pronounce some of the jazz artists&rsquo; names.  She even added some cool facts about the artists and music that I would never have known!</p>

<p><p>Today we went to my dad&rsquo;s house north of Tomball, and said HI and hung out (I read Sunday comics) and went to brunch.  Then we cruised back to my dad&rsquo;s and Jen and I read from WIRED magazine the article &ldquo;83 reasons why Bill Gates can be beat&rdquo; or something.</p>

<p><p>Then back to my part of town and we watched <em>Never Been Kissed</em>.  Drew Barrymore is totally totally cute.</p>

<p><p>Jen is spending the night at Wende&rsquo;s tonight.  I&rsquo;ve been working on website stuff with Dude.</p>

<p><p>Tomorrow:
<ul>
<li>10am: go get Jen, eat breakfast
<li>11am: hour or so at Mad Potter and paint pottery and work on my plate.
<li>1pm: Take Jen to get shoulder massage at whole foods before her flute performance on Friday.
<li>4pm: Me and Jen go to Rice for an economics experiment thing
<li>7pm: Mad Potter with youth group.  They&rsquo;ll paint 4x4 inch tiles that we will place in a newly poured sidewalk on May 2nd at the Children&rsquo;s Museum! Should be super fun.
<li>9pm: Rob and Jen at Rice and I&rsquo;ll read some chapters of <a href="../../thepin/index.html">my novel</a> to a small informal audience.  This will not be broadcast live, but will be recorded and may be broadcast later.
<li>4am - 7am Thursday  Rob and Jen on KTRU!!
</ul></p>

<p class=date>1:30pm Monday 26 April 1999</p>

<p>Jen and I just finished at KTRU.  We had big fun!  She browsed the stacks and chose discs and I played them. Great variety and she helped pronounce some of the artists and gave background information on a lot of them.  Way cool.  I recorded on tape most of the times she was speaking.

<p>Planned: my dad's on Tuesday, Kathy Fey at Whole Foods on Wednesday, Beach on Thursday, Rice Concert Thursday, Drum Circle Friday nite, Astroworld on Saturday!!

<p class=date></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="arial">1:00am Thursday 29 April 1999</font>

<p>Dad's was cool. we talked then ate at The Nook in Tomball.  Drove out via 290, back via 249 to show Jen more roads.  Saw some backwards cement mixers, with the cab in front and engine in back and the pointy end of the barrel pointing forward.

<p>Back to my dad's house he had to go to work; Jen and I read "83 Reasons Why Bill Gates Can Be Beat" or something out of WIRED magazine.

<p>Drove back to my area and watched <em>Never Been Kissed</em> starring the infinitely cute Drew Barrymore.   I worked on website stuff and found a super incredible applet composer that allowed me to create a vertical scrolling applet in 30 minutes!  I downloaded the composer from <a href="https://www.opencube.com">www.opencube.com</a>.  Jen slept at Wende's.

<p>Today: up, got Jen, hi to Cassandra and Tere and Mad Potter, got Wende's credit card at her work, went to Whole Foods so Jen could get her shoulders massaged by Kathy Fey, went to KTRU at 4pm to meet Alex et. al. for an economics experiment. We bid on various pie charts' values, and actually made money! I got $14.75; Jen got $16.25!!  Super cool!

<p>Then to Cost Plus and returned Wende's stuff and I got a picture of Sydney Australia Opera House and bay.  Then to Mad Potter where youth painted tiles for Children's Museum on Sunday.

<p>Then to Rice U and I read 3.5 chapters of <a
href="/writings/thepin/index.shtml">The Past Is Now</a> (last half of
Air vs Atmosphere, Bigg Decision, Brain Removal, and Flash Furnace) at
950 watts, outdoors in the courtyard at Ley Center.  Jen said I did
great.  One guy (crowd of like 30) went "WHooo Hooo!!" after I
finished so I gave him my copy of the chapters.</p>

<p>Listened to other readers and then home.  It's 1:10am.  Must be up in 2.3 hours to DJ at KTRU!

<p>KTRU with Jen was great.  She essentially chose all the music (all but 3 songs) and I played it.  She greatly expanded on certain artists with which she was familiar and made the show hella more interesting.  I really apreciated her help since we had to write down all the songs and artist twice, Plus the composer and time it was played for BMI, some music survey thing.
<br>At the end of the shift, Mark wasn't there so we played some long tracks and signed off after the first long one at 7:12 or so and had an 18 minute track cued up for Mark as he came in.  Thank you Jen for a great shift!!

<p class=date>1pm or so</p>

<p>We slept till 11:15 and are now at Stewart Beach in Galveston.  We checked out the nice warm water (nice and warm for Jen, barely warm for me) and I buried my toes in the sand while standing in stomach-deep water in an attempt to stay in a relatively fixed position despite the wave motion.

<p class=date>3pm</p>

<p>Eating at Bennos Cajun Style Seafood.  A dude offred us "best crawfish on the island!  Come on and try it" and another guy was munching some so we grabbed some off his platter covered in cayan pepper so thick it's now stuck in my cuticles. Crazy.  Weather is beautiful and sunny; we're eating outside.

<p>"So how'd you get to be The Crawfish King?" I asked the man.

<p>"I just started. I dunno.  I sell live crawfish to about 75% of the places on the island."

<p>"Wow.  hey <em>blah blah blah</em> want me to build you a website?"

<p>He smiled. "Naw, that's alright. I quit advertising about 2 years ago."  He burst into laughter.

<p>"Congratulations."

<p><hr width="20%" align="left">

<p>Back to eating and suddenly <em><b>bing:</b> it's time to go to the ferry.</em>  We had planned to ride the ferry, and now my angels said it was time to go.  We leisurely said bye after cleaning up and leisurely drove to the ferry.  Parked.  Walked on. <em><b>HONK</b></em> went the ferry and away we went across the bay.  Amazing perfect timing.  Thank you, angels.

<p>Walked around on that end; Jen went down a pier; I talked to some kids on a school bus waiting for the ferry.

<p class=date>7pm</p>

<p>Hopped back on a ferry once we were done chillin' and a super friendly guy saw Jen taking pictures of sea gulls being fed.  He was all, "here, stand in the back of my truck and feed them these Fritos."  He put down the tailgate and we got some great shots of Jen feeding sea gulls, and I think some of me too.

<p>Back to my place via Dairy Queen, each showered, took Jen to Rice for a concert and I'm at FlashNet meeting with Rhonda, my first possible distributor who I didn't previously know.

<p class=date>2:20am Friday 30 April 1999</p>

<p>She signed up!  We'll talk on Sunday afternoon after she gets back from the weekend.

<p>Talking to Jennifer (a different Jen) from Mad Potter now.

<p class=date>9:17am Friday 30 April 1999</p>

<p>Last night when Jennifer called, I was in the middle of pouring hot wax on Wende's feet as she was complaining about them being cold.  Jen was there and we had been playing and wrestling and doing our own silly fun talking and having a supre great time when Jennifer called at midnight.

<p>I totally broke the connection with Jen and only paid attention to Wende to peel the wax from her feet.  I was totally focused on <em>new girl</em>, a pattern I've seen too many times in my past.

<p>I am thankful that Wende called me on it this morning; I literally didn't notice last night what was happening and how I hurt Wen and Jen.

<p>After doing some self analysis, I find that I didn't want to ignore Jennifer's phone call because then she might not like me and I'd never see her again and then I'd be alone. (base level fear).   I meditated on it and set the intention to become aware if that happens again.

<p class=date>12:40am Saturday 1 May 1999</p>

<p>Today I took Jen to Rice and then worked on Meagyn's tile at Mad Potter.  Got Jen then did web stuff.  Did more when Wen and Jen went to Ikea. Then Jen and I went to NPI where the guy ruined some of the film in her camera by opening it.  Doh.  not all lost though - got lots of pics from Galveston yesterday.  Pics of Jen feeding birds on Ferry.  Then bookstop and then drum circle and wrestled with Wen and Jen on bed now we are at House of Pies. I am tired as shit.  Even "Tubthumping" couldn't even wake me up.

<p class=date>6pm Sunday 2 May 1999</p>

<p><p>Took Jen to the airport then went to youth group, then to Beck&rsquo;s Prime, then picked up tiles for the Children&rsquo;s Museum thing.</p>

<p><p>The youth had super big fun arranging the tiles in the cement, decorating the whole thing with little jeweled stone things, and the youth honored me by having my right footprint splat hugely in the middle of the square. Wow.</p>

<p><p>kT and I played in the museum with a ping pong ball blower tube thing that essentially used fans to blow ping pong balls through clear tubing to the other person&rsquo;s station.  We laughed and laughed at our respective stations for like 20 minutes, seeing who could shove the most ping pong balls toward the other person&rsquo;s thing.  So much fun.</p>

<p><p>On Friday the 17th, Wende and I drove to Dallas to visit Six Flags!!  We actually left a tad later than we had hoped, plus made a stop by my dad&rsquo;s to get my brother&rsquo;s snail mail&hellip; We got to Dallas area by like 9pm.</p>

<p><p>First stopped by my friend Carrie&rsquo;s house to say HI.  She had her friend Wendy over for a slumber party (small party). Carrie, Wendy, Wende and I all talked about whatever and watched Wendy ride her unicycle, and ate some of Wendy&rsquo;s muffins (she had made 72 for a lunch thing at her work).  I tried out the unicycle a bit and did relatively well.</p>

<p><p>Then off to my brother&rsquo;s house, fully on the other side of Dallas.  Carrie lives in Mesquite; Fred lives in Denton.  Got to his place at like midnight, and he was up studying some crazy math stuff.  (He&rsquo;s getting a doctorate degree in math at like Stanford or something) We said HI to him then went to see his friend Tamara who was doing security dispatch stuff graveyard shift.</p>

<p><p>Then slept.</p>

<p><p>(I&rsquo;ll tell the story faster)
<br>(note: several of the coasters listed are linked on <a href="https://www.sixflags.com/texas/rides/">Six Flags</a> site.  This site requires the Shockwave Flash plugin)</p>

<p><p>Got to Six Flags by 10am, though they opened at 9.  Oh well.  I had never been before.  Wende had been, but it was a super long time ago and she didn&rsquo;t totally remember the layout of the park. So map in hand I searched out Flashback, but ended up near two different coasters: Mr Freeze, and Batman The Ride.  Mr Freeze was not currently working and Batman was not completely built. Some people nearby were all, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go to Flashback!&rdquo;  We followed.</p>

<p><p>Flashback is cool.  It starts by pulling the train backwards up an incline then dropping it back through the station and through a couple of twisty inversions, a proper loop and then up another hill.  The train is pulled forward further up the hill then dropped backwards through the whole thing again.  Awesome.  I got some pics, but didn&rsquo;t get to sit in the front seat; I was a tad bummed about that.</p>

<p><p>Walked toward Shockwave and found the Mine Train. Wende said it was the first tubular steel coaster in the world!  It&rsquo;s a pretty cute little ride, similar but a tad longer and squatter than Excalibur was at Astroworld.  I got pictures while riding it, including some shots of different coasters in the park.</p>

<p><p>Then to Shockwave.  It&rsquo;s a tall gangly sort of ride, quite spread out over a several acre site.  Alongside a highway (I-30?), two loops kick off the action, and then some wild dips and various twists and turns.  I got some pictures while waiting in line.  After riding, someone asked how it was. I said, &ldquo;pretty good!  Better than it looks!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>We continued our trek around the park and found Texas Giant. It&rsquo;s a pretty huge wooden coaster, 14 stories tall with a top speed of just over 60mph.  My brother had said it wasn&rsquo;t that great, that I should skip it. We rode anyway, and I certainly enjoyed it.  Just as the ride began, I recognized I was out of film.  Doh!!  So no pics while on that ride, but I got a few after we rode.  The thing is so tall that I found it difficult to get a good shot.</p>

<p><p>Then to Casa de las Banderas for lunch.  We got supreme nachos and cheese for inflated amusement park price and chilled for about half an hour.</p>

<p><p>La Vibora (&ldquo;The Viper&rdquo; in Spanish) was next on our list. It&rsquo;s a bobsled coaster thing.  Is it a coaster?  Is it a sled? It&rsquo;s something that was pretty fun: sleds with wheels rolling down a trough. Like a water slide with no water.</p>

<p><p>At this point we had essentially ridden each coaster on the outer perimeter of the park, so we were back at the entrance. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go try Mr Freeze again.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>This we did, and this time it was open. The line was longer than it first appeared; the architects had done a sneaky job of weaving the line around where it couldn&rsquo;t be seen from other parts of the line.  Through turnstiles we went, then the line appeared to go out 1 door and immediately back in an other door. Outside the door was another set of turnstiles.</p>

<p><p>While outside, we had a good view of the coaster. It started out flat and was accelerated to 70mph and then straight UP, 90 degree twist, then 180 degree loop, 90 degree untwist, straight DOWN, then a big lazy loop thing then straight UP right between the original UP and DOWN.  Magically the train is pulled higher at this last UP and then is dropped backwards and does the whole thing backwards!!</p>

<p><p>The entire ride lasts 40 seconds.</p>

<p><p>I was intrigued by how the train is silently magically lifted at the end (middle) and by how quickly the train would rocket back out of the station again, full of new people.</p>

<p><p>I ignored how quickly the train was emptied and refilled, but pondered the lift.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;OH wait!!!&rdquo;  I remembered.  The train has silver metal fin things on each side. Electromagnets lift it, and electromagnets achieve the initial acceleration and the final deceleration!!!  Phat!!!!</p>

<p><p>Once we got back inside, there was plenty of line left, but thankfully no turnstiles.  As we got closer to the beginning of the line, we noticed an odd thing: for some reason, after waiting for some minutes, a huge gap would appear in line, bubbling backwards to the end.  &ldquo;Are people just gawking and not paying attention????&rdquo;  Hmmm.</p>

<p><p>And then the ultimate intrigue: the line hits a wall and splits.  Which way to go?  No indication is given on which way is best or what. Hmmm.</p>

<p><p>We had been talking with a mom and her two kids, like 10 and 14 years old and we chose left since the 14 year-old said it was faster.  Fair enough.  It wasn&rsquo;t faster; the right hand line started pouring people through it.  That explained the huge gaps in line, but what was back there???</p>

<p><p><b>Wow</b></p>

<p><p>We got around the corner and I was amazed.  Two trains were side by side, each on its own track.  The tracks could move independently side to side.  The one train would be on one track and move over to the side to drop off passengers and pick up a new set of riders.  During that time, the other train would have been moved to the center for launch.</p>

<p><p>Launch. &ldquo;Launch&rdquo; precisely describes this action.  The ride operator in charge of pushing &ldquo;go&rdquo; would say, &ldquo;all clear. Train is being launched,&rdquo; hit the button, and with a significant dimming of the lights and huge amperage transformers engaging, ZZZZHZZHZHZHShshshshshsshshsoooooom the train would blast out of the station, 0 to 70mph in 4 seconds.  Oh yes.  Launch.</p>

<p><p>Forty seconds later the train would blast back into the tunnel and park gently on its track, which would then move over to the other side and do the passenger thing as the other train did the launch thing.</p>

<p><p>The process was amazing. The dimming of the lights, the speed, the amperage&hellip; incredible. Plus, when the lights were on, they filled the room with cool blue light to accentuate the name Mr Freeze. 1.5 hours in line for a 40 second ride. I loved it!</p>

<p><p>Wende had expressed interest in riding The Texas Chute Out, so we went there next.  It&rsquo;s the parachute ride thing.  Just slowly up and slowly straight back down, so nothing amazing, but I was able to get some good arial pics of Mr Freeze, Batman The Ride and Flashback.</p>

<p><p>Rode Judge Roy Scream.  Tee hee.  That was cute.  I enjoyed how the ride ran parallel to a road, about the same speed as traffic. I took pictures of the car beside us. (I think I got it)</p>

<p><p>Then a 3-D movie thing called Escape from Dino Island, a takeoff from Michael Crighton&rsquo;s Jurassic Park.  It was interesting, but not worth the wait.</p>

<p><p>At Dryer&rsquo;s Ice Cream place I grabbed a Sprite and Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough float.  Wende got a cone something.</p>

<p><p>There were only 3 coasters left: that which used to be called Cliff Hanger (I don&rsquo;t remember what it&rsquo;s called now, but it&rsquo;s the L shaped freefall ride), Mini Mine Train (a smaller version of Mine Train), and Runaway Mountain (a totally enclosed coaster).</p>

<p><p>I had been on Sky Screamer, Astroworld&rsquo;s version of Cliff Hanger, so I didn&rsquo;t care about doing that again. Mini Mine Train was too small, so we went to Runaway Mountain. At Astroworld there is Mayan Mindbender, which is enclosed, but not tremendously crazy. I didn&rsquo;t expect much more from Runaway Mountain.</p>

<p><p>The line was super long, but that allowed me to finish my float (without using a spoon, so I had to be careful to keep it from getting all over my face..).  There was a super attractive girl in front of us in line.  She reminded me of the blonde character in the cartoon Foxtrot (not Paige, but the straight haired blonde at school)</p>

<p><p>I got some pictures within the ride, all dark and scary and <em>FLASH!!</em> my camera would flash suddenly.  I tried to anticipate where to point it so I would photograph track; I was successful twice I think.</p>

<p><p>I was impressed with how swervy the ride was. It&rsquo;s better than Mayan Mindbender at Astroworld.</p>

<p><p>Got some pizza and chilled for a bit.  My legs really really felt sore from standing all day.</p>

<p><p>Time to go.</p>

<p><p>Wait.  no.  Let&rsquo;s go see if the Mr Freeze line is shorter this time.  It was, so we rode it again.  We waited less than an hour this time, but still longer than I would have waited if I lived in Dallas and could come to the park anytime.</p>

<p><p>We chose the right hand side when the line split, and I was still super thrilled with how the whole thing was set up. I can just imagine the same technology in a ride like 3 times as long that doesn&rsquo;t have to essentially stop at each lift.
It&rsquo;s like ZZZZZzoooommmmmmmmmm going going going slower slower zzzzzz &hellip;&hellip;. &hellip;. then suddenly ZZZZZZZZZZZZZoooooooommmmmmmmm!!</p>

<p><p>Amazing.  I loved it again.</p>

<p><p>It was 9pm as we were leaving the park.  We had been there 11 hours.  It was fully 10pm by the time we had gotten gas in Wende&rsquo;s truck and were fully out of town.</p>

<p><p>I drove for like 2 hours, till I just couldn&rsquo;t stay awake anymore.  Loud music, loud talking, jokes.. nothing was working. Wende had slept some so she drove starting at midnight.</p>

<p><p>I woke up after 3 am; we were parked in a Kroger parking lot in Huntsville.  Wende had driven an hour until she couldn&rsquo;t drive anymore.</p>

<p><p>I drove the remaining hour or so home.  Back in Houston by 4:22am.  Church in 6.5 hours.</p>

<p><p>Wow. What a great trip!!!!</p>

<p><p><hr width="30%" align="center"></p>

<p><p>I emailed my brother some of the same stuff.  Here&rsquo;s part of his reply:</p>

<pre>
<em>- Shockwave was better than it looked.</em>
Yeah, at first you think, "Please.  Only two loops?"  When I rode it
a few years ago, I made Tamara and Bill follow me right back into
line.  

<em>- 1.5 hours in line for 40 second ride.</em>
There's a lesson in supply and demand.

<em>- Imagine that ride like 3 times as long, and it doesn't have to slow
- down for the next lift, it's like ZZZZZzoooommmmmmmmmm going going
- going slower slower zzzzzz ....... ....
- ZZZZZZZZZZZZZoooooooommmmmmmmm!!</em>
Soon, soon.

<p>##17 April 1999</p>

<p><p>Jason called this morning.  He was all, &ldquo;Rob, wanna go to Australia with me for four months?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p><em>whoah!</em> said my brain.  &ldquo;Whoah.  Four months?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.  My mom said that I should travel before I try to do anything else so I told her &lsquo;okay; me and Rob are going to Australia.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wow. That would be totally great, and I can see the value in it. I totally encourage you to do it.  I just couldn&rsquo;t take that much time off.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s cool.  I just chose you because you&rsquo;re the only person who&rsquo;s adult enough to be able to go, but still cool enough not to have a job to keep you here.  Plus you&rsquo;re like the only person I know who I wouldn&rsquo;t want to kill after being with you for more than 2 days straight.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Wow.  &ldquo;Wow. I really appreciate that.  But I just couldn&rsquo;t do it&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p><p><hr align="left" width="20%"></p>

<p><p>All day the conversation stuck in my mind. While en route to Dallas (to visit my brother and Six Flags over Texas) I had time to meditate on it.</p>

<p><p>Why not go to Australia?  I dunno.
<br>Why not go for a shorter time?  I dunno.
<br>When could you go?  After San Antonio Rally, before New Years.
<br>So that&rsquo;s all of November and December.  yup.
<br>Well?</p>

<p><p>So I called Jason from the road and left a message.  &ldquo;Yo Jason.  I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about this crazy Australia thing.  I&rsquo;ll go with you for a month, and if you want to stay longer, you certainly can.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Jason called back later and was all, &ldquo;yeah. I knew you&rsquo;d do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p class=date>Thursday 15 April 1999</p>

<p><p>Wednesday Night dinner was at Chuck E. Cheese last night. We were there until like 10pm.  I played a race driving game against Jon several times in a row; he beat me about 60 percent of the time.  I didn&rsquo;t crawl in the ball crawl.</p>

<p><p>It was like 10pm ish by the time we left. I had to go to bed before KTRU.  Woke up and called KTRU at 1am to make sure Matt was there to let me in at 4am.  He was.  Actually, Allison answered the phone, which was unexpected; she was up there working on a paper.</p>

<p><p>Woke up 3:30 and drove to the station; Allison was still there!!!  She left, then Matt turned the station over to me at 4am.  I played a pretty good variety and had fun, but only had 1 caller all night!  Allison stepped back in for a brief second like around 4:30am.</p>

<p><p>A tad after 6:30 (after I knew Wende had to be awake), I played &ldquo;She Drives Me Crazy&rdquo; from <em>Kermit Unpigged</em> CD.  It was Kermit and Miss Piggy on vocals.</p>

<p><p>At exactly 6:56am I started the wack hidden track on the CD <em>Girl Crushes Boy</em> by Smile.  It is 4 minutes long and is samples from a telephone conversation where a girl totally has a crush on some guy.</p>

<p><p>At the very end he&rsquo;s all, &ldquo;anywhere you want, anytime between 6 and 6:30.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>She&rsquo;s all, &ldquo;okay, 6:30 in your pants, your place.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>He goes, &ldquo;really?  okay.  Um, how about seven?&rdquo; and the track ends.</p>

<p><p>I paused for a second, &ldquo;&hellip;  it&rsquo;s seven o&rsquo;clock&hellip; . K-T-R-U Houston&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I went on to name all the songs I had just played, and announced that everyone had 17 hours to turn in their taxes.</p>

<p><p>I had told 3 people to be sure to listen right before 7am for that; I&rsquo;ve been wanting to do it for about a month or so, but just got the CD on Saturday.</p>

<p><p><hr align="left" width="10%"></p>

<p><p>So it was 7am, and Mark wasn&rsquo;t there yet.  Hmmmm.</p>

<p><p>I cued up a Texas blues song or something and the phone rang (my second call of the night). I hoped it was Mark.  It was Jonathon.  He&rsquo;s the DJ who has the Wednesday 4-7am shift (He&rsquo;s new like me).  I had invited him to listen to my 7am entertainment.  He thought it sounded great and we talked a bit, but I told him I had to go and try to find Mark.</p>

<p><p>I put on one of my fav CDs called <em>Frankenstein Symphony</em> by Francis Dhomont.  The tracks are all just sounds with no beat - they are like subtle movie soundtrack noises for a horror flick.  But not that scary.</p>

<p><p>I called Mark&rsquo;s number, and it rang like 10 times.  I was just about to hang up when his room mate answered.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Is Mark there?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let me go see..&rdquo;   [pause]  &ldquo;he&rsquo;s sleepin&rsquo;; should I wake him up?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah totally wake his ass up.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>[pause]</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;He said he&rsquo;ll be right there??&rdquo;  Room mate was intrigued that Mark knew what the call was about.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Cool.  How long?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>[pause] &ldquo;fifteen or twenty minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;cool.  thanks.  bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>So I just chilled and listened to Frankenstein Symphony.  The track was about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> over with 8 minutes left when I thought, &ldquo;boring.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>So I grabbed an ambient techno CD called &ldquo;Astral Pilot&rdquo;, which just happened to have an 11 minute track of heavy ambient beats.  Awesome.</p>

<p><p>I cued up the CD and slowly faded the beats of Astral Pilot on top of Frankenstein Symphony, faded FS out, back in, AP out, back in, crazy just fade in out in out each different one, until FS got a tad interesting and I faded out Astral Pilot and paused the CD.</p>

<p><p>FS got dull again and I faded in the beats of AP, then switched them in and out every 4 beats.  So FS was in background and the beats would go [thump] [thump] [thump] <a href="pause">thump</a> (pause) (pause) (pause)
<br>[thump] [thump] [thump] <a href="pause">thump</a> (pause) (pause) (pause)
<br>[thump] [thump] [thump] <a href="pause">thump</a> (pause) (pause) (pause)
<br>[thump] [thump] [thump] <a href="pause">thump</a> (pause) (pause) (pause)
<br>[thump] [thump] [thump] <a href="pause">thump</a> (pause) (pause) (pause)</p>

<p><p>And then FS got interesting again and I faded out the beats for a bit and then back in and I got a phone call.  (My third one of the night).</p>

<p><p>It was a woman&rsquo;s voice, &ldquo;What song have you been playing?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Heh.  &ldquo;Well, actually I&rsquo;ve been mixing two songs.  One is <em>Frankenstein Symphony</em> by Francis Dhomont, and the other is &lsquo;Astral Pilot&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;  She almost sounded disappointed, or maybe like, &ldquo;ah that explains it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Can you hear them right now?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; I faded down Frankenstein Symphony, &ldquo;this is Astral Pilot.&rdquo;  I faded FS back in.  &ldquo;And this,&rdquo; I faded down AP, &ldquo;is Frankenstein Symphony.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmm.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s <em>that</em> for catering to a listener?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Pretty good.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Which one do you like better?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I like the Frankenstein Symphony better.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Cool.  I put that one on for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>The track was just ending, so I bumped Frankenstein Symphony back to track 3, my favorite of the four on the CD.  Just then Mark walked in.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sorry I&rsquo;m late.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No sweat.&rdquo;  I told him what I had just been mixing and he laughed.  I asked him to let this one song continue for my unnamed listener and he said no problem.</p>

<p><p>Signed off the station log and went home.</p>

                        <p class=date>3:39am Friday 9 April 1999</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ve been up for 24 hours now, starting with KTRU, ultimate, computer work, dinner with Wende, and now more computer work and Dude and I have just finished phase one of www.frontofficeautomation.com.  Actually there are two versions different only in the motif of graphics used in each version.</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;ll talk to Mike and see which one he likes better.</p>

<p><p>This weekend KTRU has a big meeting on Friday (changing of leadership), and KTRU is hosting their 8th Annual Outdoor show from noon till 8pm on Saturday.</p>

<p><p>Also this weekend, the Southwest District is having their Spring Conference in the woodlands, at my old church, about 1 hour north of here.  I want greatly to fully attend all these events.  We&rsquo;ll see how it goes.</p>

<p><p>KTRU meeting starts in 8 hours.</p>

                        <p class=date>7:12pm Thursday 8 April 1999</p>

<p><p>Aw man, first, super duper special thanks to Wende for reminding me last night that today is Thursday and I was supposed to work at KTRU!!!!  I had totally forgotten it, and she mentioned it offhandedly (whatever that is supposed to mean) and I was like, &ldquo;!!!!!!!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Wende and I had just eaten at Dude and Veronica&rsquo;s house and it was gettin&rsquo; late. We still had to go to Sterling McCall to get Scott after he had his timing belt and water pump replaced.</p>

<p><p>See, the water pump failed, causing the timing belt to break, so they didn&rsquo;t warranty anything. I wasn&rsquo;t super joyful, but thankful that now I have 1 year or 12000 miles warranty on my timing belt <em>and</em> my water pump!  $590 was the price they quoted me.</p>

<p><p>We got there at like 11:30pm and it was only $540. Yay. Drove home and finished reviewing a CD that I have had for a while. Couldn&rsquo;t print my review since my printer was out of ink. D&rsquo;oh! (No, I wasn&rsquo;t going to hand write the review after typing it so neatly).  Went to bed at like 1am.</p>

<p><p>I had napped earlier in the day, so 3:20 am didn&rsquo;t come tooo early. I got up, showered (first time I&rsquo;ve showered before KTRU) drove in.  Matt was there on the 1-3am shift so I got into the building no problem.</p>

<p><p>He was playing a spoken thing&ndash;this dude was eloquently describing just how completely depressed he was and how he masochistically kept himself alive as punishment. The simple act of being alive felt difficult for this man.  The track was like 15 or 30 minutes long of depressed depression. It ended delightfully close to 4am.  I played &ldquo;All I Want for Christmas is My Two Front Teeth&rdquo; to lighten the mood.</p>

<p><p>I played a pretty great variety.  One 30 minute set had like Tejano, reggae, rock, jazz, ska, hardcore rap, and a 30 second segment of Neil Armstrong first stepping onto the moon all mixed in.</p>

<p><p>Got a call like at 6:15 or so. It was the next DJ calling in sick, inviting me to simply turn off the station at 7am.  Hmmmm.</p>

<p><p>I told him I would probably hang out for a bit longer, maybe try to call some other DJs to get someone in.  He said thanks, but that it wasn&rsquo;t that big of a deal to turn the station off.</p>

<p><p>Then I got a call around 6:50 am.  It was Jen in New Hampshire!! Woah!  She got RealAudio and was listening to me on the web! That is so super cool. Wow. I was already having fun and now I felt inspired to just keep on spinning records. I went until 9am when the next next DJ arrived.</p>

<p><p>Went home, ate a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and went to bed for about 1.5 hours.</p>

<p><p>Had dreams of KTRU, taking requests and playing music, and not having the music that was requested. Not really <em>bad</em> not having the music, just <em>oh well</em> not having it.</p>

<p><p>Woke up, wrote a long letter for some youth stuff, and made travel plans to visit Great America in early May.</p>

<p><p>Travel-plan-making was great.  I have a guest pass on America West Airlines, so I called them, but they didn&rsquo;t have round trip service to the city I wanted to visit (Chicago).  I called Southwest, for which I have a $200+ voucher, but they don&rsquo;t fly to O&rsquo;Hare.  Hmmm.  So I called Jayne, my favorite bestest travel agent (281-359-1010) and she was all, &ldquo;you wanna go to O&rsquo;Hare?  You&rsquo;ve got $290 flight credit with Continental with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>WHOAH!!  Sign me up!   I was so super duper thankful that she remembered (maybe their computers remembered, but who cares) and wow.  Yes oh yes, and the ticket will only cost like $210 of that so I&rsquo;ll have like $80 left. Awesome.  Thank you Jayne; thank you Angels.</p>

<p><p>Then Dude and I went to play frisbee.  My disc was in Wende&rsquo;s truck so he bought an ultimate disc and we went to Rice to play. The wind was super breezy and shifty and not quite gusty, making play challenging.</p>

<p><p>I did well for not having practiced much and Dude got some great throws fairly consistently.  I noticed he did better when he didn&rsquo;t really try or concentrate, but just let it happen.</p>

<p><p>A team was in an adjacent field so we went and watched/talked with them. Once their scrimmage was over, I joined a 3 on 3 man quick game.</p>

<p><p>OH MY GOODNESS I was so winded. Stomach in a knot, phlegm in throat, tired, panting, hot! Wow. I will do that more often to keep in better shape.</p>

<p><p>I got some pretty good throws and catches in, but didn&rsquo;t play as great as I have in the past. I haven&rsquo;t practiced in quite a while. I enjoyed the exertion.</p>

<p><p>Now Dude and I are going to work on website stuff.</p>

                        <p class=note>(transcribed from my diary)</p>
<p class=date>Midnight Tuesday 6 April 1999</p>

<p><p>Worked at KTRU today from 1 to 3pm - my first day shift, which I subbed for a woman I&rsquo;ve never met, who calls herself (on email) miss meagan. Got lots of requests and played most of them; I almost got bogged down!</p>

<p><p>Got a request for Miranda July, a favorite CD of mine, but the CD is gone!!!!  This really bums me out; it had just gone off the more carefully watched playlist a couple weeks ago, and now it&rsquo;s been misplaced or swiped from the stacks.  Boo.</p>

<p><p>However(!) in a previous show, I had tape recorded &ldquo;Medical Wonder&rdquo; by Miranda July as I played it mixed with a track from Francis Dhomont <em>Frankenstein Symphony</em>!  I think the mix is super cool, adding drama to &ldquo;Medical Wonder&rdquo;.  So I played it off my tape, which I had with me at the station since I&rsquo;m still recording myself most times I go on the air. The tape sounded a bit quieter than the original, so I had the output level pegged to 10+;  Manda told me later that it sounded fine.</p>

<p><p>Worked on www.frontofficeautomation.com (not up yet) and I&rsquo;m aggrrrvated that some of the pages aren&rsquo;t coming up the same though it&rsquo;s the same HTML as far as I can tell.  Hmmm.</p>

<p><p>Talked to Carina about my flying into O&rsquo;Hare for my trip to Great America May 7-9, and talked to Jen about her trip to visit Houston and Rice University the last week of April! I&rsquo;m super excited about both trips!</p>

<p><p>Then went to Wednesday nite dinner on Tuesday nite (to prepare for youth Sunday, the Order of Service of which needed to be done by Wednesday morning), and on the way there my car Scott started making crazy bad noises.  I only noticed as I was idling stopped at Smoothie King to grab a Smoothie. Uh oh.</p>

<p><p>Didn&rsquo;t get a Smoothie, backed up Scott to see what was wrong. Plenty of oil. Plenty of water. (where is the transmission fluid level thing?) Hmmm.  Scott seemed to run fine, but just make this crazy noise!  Sadness about my car, fear and anxiety about being late, but I simply called in late to Jon, a youth with a cell phone. I drove to an auto parts place to ask for someone to listen to see if they could let me know what it was. They felt short staffed so couldn&rsquo;t send anyone out.</p>

<p><p>My inner guidance guided me to simply drive gently to church for the youth group so I did.</p>

<p><p>We got everything planned and are doing some pretty creative things:
<ul>
<li>tangerine communion (including napkins in each order of service)
<li>playing that &ldquo;Sunscreen&rdquo; song where the guy gives an oration and says &ldquo;wear sunscreen; it&rsquo;s a proven fact. the rest of this is just my opinion&rdquo;  (yes, for internet junkies, you saw it attributed to Kurt Vonnegut or someone on the web)
<li>and we&rsquo;ll have Lionel, a man with a beautiful voice and spectacular wardrobe sing a solo, wearing the most extravagant stuff he would like to wear.
</ul></p>

<p><p>That done, Wende drove behind me as I drove Scott to the dealership.  I actually got a big (short lived) head start and made it about a mile away to an intersection.  Wende called on cell phone, &ldquo;where are you?&rdquo;  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m at the intersection, catch up!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Within 30 seconds Scott&rsquo;s idling sputtered and he passed out.</p>

<p><p>The light had just turned green and cars were honking behind me to go, instead I turned my hazard lights on and the cars pulled around me without another glance.  Wende pulled up behind me and I got out. &ldquo;Push me across the intersection into Coney Island.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>We were at a T intersection; when the light turned green again she just pushed my straight forward into the parking lot of James Coney Island hot dog place.</p>

<p><p>Called AAA, looked through my Costa Rica scrapbook until the wrecker dude came. I described the problem and without hesitation he said, &ldquo;timing belt.&rdquo;  I told him I wanted it towed to the dealership, and he was all, &ldquo;you sure? they&rsquo;re gonna be expensive.&rdquo;  I was sure.  He said he would meet us at the dealership, so we left.</p>

<p><p>Missed the exit the first time around, and got there just as he was letting Scott down off his truck. It was 11:30pm; I&rsquo;m thankful the service department is open until midnight.</p>

<p><p>I described the problem to the woman at the counter and she was all, &ldquo;timing belt.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I had it changed here recently.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Probably it was at 60,000 miles; let&rsquo;s look.&rdquo;  She looked through my records and found brakes fixed, something else, something else, something else, and then <em>bing</em> &ldquo;timing belt.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I threw my hands in the air in a mock shout of triumph.  Turns out it had been changed a year ago; I was exactly on the edge of the warranty period of 1 year or 12,000 miles.  Since it was changed I had driven 2 days less 1 year, and 695 miles over 12,000 miles.</p>

<p><p>ooooh.</p>

<p><p>So she wrote a note to indicate the situation, followed by &ldquo;Please Help!&rdquo; at the end. That was 10.5 hours ago; I&rsquo;ll hear from them today.  My hope is that they will honor the warranty. I will certainly be more likely to stick with them if they do.</p>
