<p>So far behind!!!!</p>

<p>I've been work work workin' a lot today and
yesterday.  Have made good stuff happen.  Just moved
on a new version of G3/OG combo, continuing to make it
more and more awesome.</p>

<p>Oh!  That reminds me that we are now running with
dual webservers, and 1 RAID 5 data server.  Very nice.
 They set that up this weekend.</p>

<p>Also this past weekend, Wende and I cruised up to
Altus, Oklahoma to chill in her grandparents lakehouse
(they call it a cabin, but lemme tell you, Abe Lincoln
didn't have solid walls and air conditioning) and
attended Tangie's wedding on Saturday.  Tangie is one
of Wende's cousins.</p>

<p>Got my bike back from the shop today.  They
tightened all the parts and cleaned it and adjusted it
and all good stuff.  It was my bike's free 30 day
checkup.</p>

<p>I haven't named my bike.  Hmm.  Ike?  Nah.  We'll
see if a name appears to fit.</p>

<p>Tonight I have a tentative plan to hang out with
Meg and Abi and friends from KTRU playing boardgames
at their house.  Should be fun!</p>

<p>I'm going home now.</p>

<p>ps:  oh - I have some entries in my Handspring from
this weekend that I'll put on here soonishly.</p>

<p>Have a great 4th!</p>

<p>We had a free rental from Blockbuster tonight and Wende let me pick
the movie.  I chose <em>Gone In 60 Seconds</em> given Erika's approval
of the movie.  Plus it had Angelina (sp) Joilee (sp), though as you
may know, she certainly didn't have the lead role.</p>

<p>My favorite part was of course the chase scene at the end where
Nicholas Cage was driving the car backwards all superfast.  And when
the Hummer smushed the other car backwards uphill.  "Put on the
brakes!"  "I am!!"</p>

<p>Movie was good; worth a free rental.  To ensure that we didn't
incur late fees, I already took the movie back tonight.</p>

<p class=date>1:02am CDT Wednesday 4 July 2001</p></p>

<p>Rode my bike tonight:</p>

<p>Turned in the movie first.  Mailed some mail.  Bonked my pedal on
my shin.  Ow.</p>

<p>Toward downtown, through the blocked off Allen Parkway, imagining
the throngs of people who will <em>each</em> pay 3 or 4 or 5 dollars
just to get in the place.   There's a tank parked on the street.  I
didn't see any marks on the asphalt.  I wonder how it was placed there
so daintily.</p>

<p>There's a blocked off VIP section with chairs and tables and
tablecloths.  Wow.</p>

<p>Out the other end of Allen Parkway past the barricade and into
downtown.</p>

<p>Rollin' through cars packing a few square blocks of downtown as
there are some bars/clubs that are hoppin' each night.  Smartly
dressed cats all lined up to get in.  I wonder what's so interesting
in there.  And in there.  And there.</p>

<p>I rolled out of the traffic and then down the hill entirely away.
Top gear.  Hauling butt.</p>

<p>Catch my breath, meander towards home.</p>

<p>"Hey.  No." said the rent-a-cop in the Suburban when I tried to go
down a street toward Allen Parkway.  "Okay," and I turned around, went
down the block to the next street that went toward Allen Parkway.  No
worries.</p>

<p>Rolled past a cop car on this next street toward Allen Parkway.  I
wondered if he would car, but he did not.  I wonder what's so special
about that other street?</p>

<p>Got past the light and then hauled ass lying flying flying down the
hill in topmost gear and look up "OH Shit!!"  There were barricades
blocking the road.  (g- I was like Jaws on <em>Moonraker</em> when he
breaks off the steering wheel of the speedboat just before going over
the waterfall, except I had no time to make a funny expression.)
Relatively hard brakes as I determined I could <em>probably</em> get
between the barricades.  Brake, slide my back tire a bit, slip right
between them.  WHEW!!!!!!!  I took this as a sign to end my adventures
for the evening.</p>

<p>On the way home, on Waugh, I rolled along the outside sidewalk of a
new strip center that's been installed.  At one point the sidewalk
suddenly takes 4 or 5 small steps down.  I rode down them no problem.
Got to the other end, turned around, dropped into low low gear and
tried to ride up, but my back tire lost traction and just spun when it
got to the step.  I'll need to practice that more.  But the funny
thing is the entire reason I'm writing about these steps: There is an
elevator that goes up and down those 4 or 5 steps.  A full blown
elevator with a door on each side so people can roll in, click the
button and go up/down and roll out.  Amazing.  I pushed the button so
I could ride my bike in the elevator, but it seems to not be plugged
in.</p>

<p>Wende and I are in Altus, Oklahoma at the cabin with Stacy and Rodd
and Karston.  This is Big Daddy's cabiin, and has been in the family
for a long ass time.</p>

<p>Wende painted that big tractor wheel sandbox.  Picture of Wende
and her dad on his motorcycle.  That's the hill where Wende popped her
first wheelie on motorcylce.  That's the hill where Wende had her
first accident on motorcycle, and she pushed it all the way to here
and decided not to push it up the hill so she left it in a neighbor's
yard and got her Meme.</p>

<p>On the way up here, I drove from Corsicana or so through Ft Worth
and we ate iin Witchita Falls, which is good because I've always
wanted to go to Witchita Falls, but....  Witchita Falls is nothing
like I had hoped.  I was looking for lots of forest and a river with
waterfall.  It's just a small Texas city with highway construction and
a Wendy's with the Frosty machine broken.</p>

<p>We hit approximately one million bugs after it got dark as we
crossed the state line.  Gross!!!!</p>

<p>Arrived at Uncle Mark and Aunt Joy's house and watched the last
little bit of some 15 year old home videos, the funniest of which was
seeing then-8-year-old Brian break dancing to Wende singiing Billie
Jean.  He was flopping and falling all over the carpet..  So funny!
Especially as he kept flopping to no music and then, 'Brian, it's
over.'</p>

<p class=note>dream</p>

<p class=dream>In a schhool, Mr Bandecca was teaching, and I carried
Wende on one hip as if she were my baby, and was all, this is Wende,
my girl.... friend' jut wanted you to meet her.  and someone else was
still teaching class so mr bandecca came out and showed us the latest
project he was working on, which was still a big secret and it was
having the Harlem Globetrotters come do a demonstration thing / movie
at the school and I was trying to cover up what he was working on to
keep it a secret and Bryan Beck came up all, "what are you doing?"
And I was all, "can't show you" but he said he already knew that the
Globe Trotters were coming, and the there was a huge crowd all around
me as we were sitting outside in an assembly type thing listening to
some guy talk about a movie he was going to write and the main
character was a bad guy from previous movies but he was being played
by a different actor this time, and the announcer was all, "he wasn't
bad enough in the first movie, but he realized that with a more round
face and larger nose, he could be the terror of the world" as the new
actor didn't look anything like the old actor. And then someone was
tapping on my shoulder, but I didn't know who so I got up and went
over to the side of the group and looked back and it was my brother
Fred and I motioned for him to come over, and he motioned, "no you
come over here" and I walked closer to where he was and he wanted to
show me a project that he was working on about something he was doing
at school, and then the movie advertisement was showing the bad guy
giving noogies to the protagonist in the movie and he turned out to be
the same actor as the male protagonist in the movie so he was all,
Yeah I'll be doing two different parts, but I can do it.  and I woke
up.</p>

<p>----</p>

<p class=note>previous dream</p>

<p class=dream>met Barbara bush and Tammy's mom and we were going to
follow them to somewhere. I gave BB a hug and she was sad that her son
didn't win again,..........</p>

<p>(went and took pictures of Karston and Wende and Stacy, then Rodd
and I went down to the lake to chill and talk.. (dream is vaporized
from my brain))</p>

<p>Wende and I just went for a hike around the yucca plant near the
cabin.  So much fun!  Wende got pissed though because of somethiing.
I'm not sure what.  She got apricot between her toes.  Maybe that was
it.  I think I maybe pushed her too hard to hike and she got mad at
that.</p>

<p>But I certainly had fun and I won't forget it!</p>

<p>Leaving the cabin for Tangie's wedding soon.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Ceremony was beautiful and small; the wedding reception was greatly
attended.  I danced like a maniac and hopefully got some people out on
the floor.  Or maybe I scared them away.  But a few people asked if I
could teach them how to dance like that. </p>

<p>"I just fake it; I don't know how to dance.  Just let the music
move you."</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Stopped by a car wash to wash all the bugs off the front of Wende's
truck before we bake them on while driving back to Houston.</p>

<p>While I washed the bugs off, Wende got a monster bug bite on her
shoulder.  She said it really really hurt and she almost cried.  Wow.
Kinda like my scorpion sting 3 years ago.  The bite had a red dot in
the middle about 1 mm across and the welt was about 1 mm high and 1 cm
across.</p>

<p>Back at the cabin, I put some baking soda / water mix on the bite,
which I have heard will draw out the poison.  It seemed to help.  This
morning the bite was gone, except for the red dot.</p>

<p>This morning we met and Meme and BigDaddy's house, then ate at the cafe inside the grocery store, where I talked at length with Dennis and Kimmie, long-time friends of the family.</p>

<p>Dennis is quite smart.</p>

<p>On the way out of the  store, Wende saw that they sell dry ice.  We bought a cooler and 3 small blocks of dry ice and went across the street to Braums and bought 1 gallon and 3 pints of Braums ice cream, a pint of which will go to Sharri at Wende's work.</p>

<p>Sharri and Wende like Braum's ice cream.</p>

<p class=date>12:35 pm Sunday 1 July 2001</p>

<p>On the way home now, I'm teaching Wende the Alphabet Game that Fred and I know!  She has successfully recited up to P, and I just taught her Q and R.  So awesome!</p>

<p>We just stopped in Vernon, Texas to let Wende change into her overalls.</p>

<p>As a result of this trip, I am more in love with Wende than ever before.  I've been having an incredible great time with her!</p>

<p>I know I've been f-in' around with linux for a while, but I've
still never really hacked into it and tried to figure shit out.  I
don't know how to use RPM, and I have no clue how to rebuild the
kernel.</p>

<p>In November, Marcel helped me set up the network configuration of
eth0, so that the system would automagically be connected to the DSL
line when it booted.  When we changed to cable modem, I was still
using DSL, but needed to use DHCP instead of setting specific IP
addresses.</p>

<p>It took me long enough to figure out how to get DHCP to work at
all.  Then I found a daemon dhcpcd which I could just run as root and
then tada! we're connected.</p>

<p>However, I still wasn't sure how to make DHCP start at boot time.
This would cause the boot process to take super way too long as
sendmail would wait for something to timeout - about 3 minutes it
seemed.  Maybe more.</p>

<p>So I trial-and-errored my way to finding the directory and config
files that Marcel worked with in November.  Found them, and then pored
over the code to see what called what with what options, etc etc until
I found the solution:</p>

<p>In the eth0 configuration file, I set the boot protocol to dhcp.</p>

<p>That was it!  Yay linux and red hat for being so precise in
configuration; yay me for figuring out how to do it!</p>

<p>PS: while I searched through the directories to find the files
Marcel had changed, I found how to change the system version number
and name when one is at the login prompt.  Now it says
(thunderrabbit) instead of (Hurricane)</p>

<p>I worked for 15 hours yesterday, and completed my entire list of
things to do, which included moving a new version of G3 online
(version 2.00) in which I merged the files from G3 and OG into one big
"package."</p>

<p>I also completed the setup of a small survey that uses the OG
components of G3-OG combo, and tested that, and sent email to the
director of the survey to say she can test it.</p>

<p>I set up email-creating files for the singapore survey, and stayed
up emailing back and forth with them (they're 12 hours ahead, so they
got into the office around 8pm our time) to make sure those all looked
okay.<p>

<p>Earlier in the day I worked on creating documentation for G3 -- not
just comments in the code, but a document that describes why G3 exists
and how it works in general.  I'll continue to write how to configure
it and stuff later.</p>

<p>And I met with Karla, Kevin, Minh about a problem Minh had with the
G3 which really was just that I had moved a new version online and
didn't tell him.  That was the core problem, and I won't do it again,
but they kept hashing about the details of what happened, trying to
make sure that just the version mismatch could have caused the
problem.  Yes I was right, that's what caused it.  And yes, I won't
move a new version online without letting everyone know.</p>

<p>Today (Friday) is a day off for me and Wende - we're driving to
Altus, Oklahoma for Tangie's wedding.  I don't even know who Tangie
is.  Hang on.</p>

<p>She's one of Wende's first cousins on Wende's dad's side of the
family.</p>

<p class=dream>Driving on a highway and it was raining hard.  I was
still driving fast with the rest of traffic, and suddenly there was
traffic coming my direction on my side of the freeway.  I scooted
over to the right hand lane to get out of their way.  Christine was
riding with me, and some other people.</p>

<p class=dream>We stopped and were walking along some slightly hilly
terrain, and came up to a small pond where there were iguanas swimming
in the water.  We saw no fewer than 8 iguanas and 1 alligator.  The
alligator was right next to one of the girls from ultimate, and I told
her to move out of the way, but she did not get bitten because I
recognized it was a dream.</p>

<p class=dream>I wondered about what would have been the best thing to
say to keep her from being alarmed, but still have her move quickly out
of the water, and not go, "what?" as the alligator bit her.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p></p>

<p class=dream>Driving home from Austin, I was so tired that I didn't
really remember the drive once I arrived home.  Actually I arrived at
Bob an Jennifer's house as planned, and they were about to have pizza
with their two sons.  I told them I was so tired and wondered if I
could just sleep in their living room until time to eat.</p>

<p class=dream>I didn't need the sleep apparently as I rode my bike to
the pizza place, and I spent a pretty long time outside locking it
up. to a frame that was part bunk bed, part newspaper dispenser, part
bike rack.  I debated whether to lock up my backpack or just the
bike.  I locked up both.</p>

<p class=dream>Went inside to eat and they already had their food, ad
there was a slice of pizza waiting for me to eat.</p>

<p class=dream>I then went to a closet where I had apparently hidden a
key to my bike lock.  The closet was musty, spooky, and almost
empty. As I was looking for the container in which my key was hidden,
a slightly rotten something fell from the ceiling.  Like a leather
pouch or something.  I was startled and woke up before I could look
inside the mysterious bag.</p>
