<p>I slept from pleiades to orion, and now there is ice on Scott's
windshield.  I've got to pee and I'm choosing not to do so in this
parking area; I'm going to drive to Carlsbad (some miles) to find a 24
hour something hopefully.  And to warm up.</p>

<p>Oh, it wasn't ice; just fog on the inside.</p>

<p class=date>2:34am</p>

<p>Wandered aimlessly around a Super Wal-Mart, looking for that
perfect something to fix all my woes.  Found nothing, but saw some
cute Power Puff Girls blankets for only 15 dollars and watched the end
of <em>Ice Age</em> also available for 15 dollars.  Wandered out.</p>

<p>I'm stopped at a Rest Area (with no restrooms) / Weigh Station
(closed) to sleep some more.  Considered stopping by one of the motels
for shower/bed/electricity, but decided I'm not that desperate yet.</p>

<p>Why must i become desperate before I'll spend some $ to get nice
things?</p>

<p>Good night again.</p>

<p>Wow there is a flare burning on a short (30 foot) pole behind me.
How is it possible that I didn't notice that on my way into this
parking lot?</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>During the night I woke up once and the flare was off.  That's how.</p>

<p>Heehee.  MST = Mountain Standard Time.  I'm on Mountain Time!</p>

<p>I'm waking up to a thin band of red/orange/yellow on the horizon
which deepens to dark blue behind me.</p>

<p>I'll be first in line at Carlsbad Caverns.  I hope that doesn't
mean I'll be waiting forever...</p>

<p class=date>6:41am</p>

<p>Oops.  I looked at my phone which is still on CST, so I have an
hour plus ten minutes to wait.  I think I'll ride my bike around.</p>

<p class=date>7:37am</p>

<p>Wow.  Fun ride.  Downdowndowndowndowndown down down down down the
hill for about 12 minutes.  Had on my thermal shirt, T-shirt (U2
concert), hoodie, helmet, jeans, socks, shoes, heavy leather gloves.
Was still a bit cold with the sun just barely peaking over the hill at
various points.</p>

<p>Then back up.</p>

<p>Up.</p>

<p>up</p>

<p>up.</p>

<p>up.</p>

<p>Up</p>

<p>up</p>

<p>For about 24 minutes, including a couple stops for very short
rests.  Tight tight tight quads once I reached the top.  Oh, and there
is a downward slope at the top of the hill so I was able to reach top
speed again going back up the mount to the visitors center.  Nice.</p>

<p>Now I'm hoping to be able to do a strenuous caving tour that
requires crawling.  I'll find out when the open in 18 minutes.</p>

<p class=date>12:13pm</p>

<p>Done with Carlsbad exploration.  I'll write in a moment.  Kinda
headachey now.  I'm going inside with computer to see if I can use an
electrical outlet to recharge my battery.</p>

<p><em>Basically</em> I walked down the "natural" entrance (which was
quite unnatural with its asphalt path winding down into the cave) and
wound down to the Big Room (named because it's really big), walked
around its perimeter and then took the elevators out.</p>

<p>Coolest stuff I saw included some volunteers cleaning red clay out
of the Long Man's Bathtub (long skinny pool thing) which had been
coated in clay by the original explorers back in the day.</p>

<p>Also cool was the eagle in the zoo.  I don't have a picture of
this, but the formation looked like an eagle soaring into the rock,
including his face and one curving wing.</p>

<p>This formation I saw only because a ranger showed it to me.  That
was on the fourth time I saw her as I circled the big room.  The third
time I saw her she was talking to some people and telling them how the
US government considered using Carlsbad Caverns as a fallout shelter
in case of nuclear war.  Only problem is the constant air exchange in
the caverns.  "All" of the air in the caverns circulates out in 48
hours, so that means all the air would be filled with radiation in 48
hours.  D'oh!</p>

<p>I didn't get to do one of the "strenuous" tours; apparently they
are booked well in advance (weeks) and I think they only go on
weekends.</p>

<p>Oh, the other cool thing was story of how the Spirit Room was
discovered.  Some cats in 1985 used helium balloons to float two ropes
up to an apparent chamber in the ceiling of the big room.  The ascent
was 225 feet or so and once climbed, revealed some 750 feet more cave
to explore.</p>

<p>Another story is that speedy airflow through a hole in the floor
marked the entrance to 100+ <em>miles</em> of cave that has been
explored only by scientist type people.  I forget the name of this
part of the cave, but it starts with an L.</p>

<p>Lechiguilla (sp), according to the girl ranger who just walked by
me (our fifth encounter today).</p>

<p class=date>1:31pm</p>

<p>Okay; I have just slept sitting in a chair here in the lobby area
of Carlsbad Caverns visitor center.  Battery is at 85% charge.  I'm
going to roll out and visit.....  something out west.  I'll probably
drive along I-10 to Tuscon and see if I can find my second cousin
Jeanette.</p>

<p>Or maybe I'll go a bit north and ... there was something up north I
considered visiting White Sands National Monument maybe.</p>

<p>I do know that I plan to drive along I-8 because it's souther than
I-10 and would take me just north of restricted military bombing and
gunnery range, so maybe I'd get to see or hear some explosions or see
some planes and such.</p>

<p>87% now.  :-)</p>

<p class=date>1:51pm</p>

<p>As I was leaving, saw her a sixth time and she asked if I had
visited the Lechuguilla room.  I hadn't, but now I have and can now
spell the name correctly.</p>

<p>Visiting that part of the cave would be quite a journal entry
indeed.</p>

<p>I'm tooo tired to make it to Tuscon tonight, which is just fine
because I've been unable to reach Jeanette on my cellie.  She
apparently has married some cat named Kim, according to my mom's
cousin Mickey.</p>

<p>So I'm at a rest stop just west of Gage, NM on I-10.  Rest stops in
New Mexico are cool because they allow a body to stay overnight.
Signs say we can't stay more than 24 hours.  That's plenty of time to
get a good night's sleep.</p>

<p class=date>9:27pm</p>

<p>There are railroad tracks behind me.  Three trains have gone by
since I've been here.  Fast trains, too.  I dunno if they're going 60
mph, but let's just say that I won't be trying to jump onto one of
these trains.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>

<p class=date>5:05am MST Friday 29 November 2002</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>

<p>I'm still at the rest stop outside Gage.  My phone seems to have a
super tired battery.  I have to hold my car charger onto the phone to
make it charge, and even then it's not always charging.  Silly phone.
I just tried using the outlet in the restroom, but it didn't seem to
work.  Pooh.</p>

<p>1137 miles traveled since Dallas.</p>

<p>My neck muscles are sore from sleeping weirdly, and my right calf
is sore from driving.  (Scott has no cruise control)</p>

<p>Let's roll.</p>

<p>Oh, I should check Scott's oil first.</p>

<p class=date>5:21am</p>

<p>Oil is fine.  What took me the longest is opening the sealed
plastic packaging around the flashlight.</p>

<p class=date>5:36am</p>

<p>Mile marker fifty-one, I just crossed a sign that said CONTINENTAL
DIVIDE ELEV 4585 feet four five eight five.  But my road is flat flat
flat flat flat.  wierd.  I-10 west.</p>

<p>Just visited with Jackie, one of the Cave Restoration Foundation
volunteers that was cleaning Longfellows Bathtub (I had the name wrong
before).  She has been doing this type of work for four years now.
Used to live up in Alaska working in the fishing industry (tells me
not to have raw sea bass because it often has parasites) on a fish
ferry that carries fish from the fishing boats back to shore so those
cats don't have to stop fishing.  Her boat would also deliver mail to
them and such.</p>

<p>She inquired a bit about my adventure, so I gave her an adventure
card; my first to give out on this western state tour.</p>

<p>She had to split to connect with her fellow cave cleaners at 2:30.</p>

<p>After visiting a natural shelter "used by Apaches" et. al., I had
some indecision on where to go next.  I flipped a coin to help:</p>

<p>Roswell?  No.</p>

<p>White Sands?  No.</p>

<p>El Paso?  No.</p>

<p>Las Cruces?  No.</p>

<p><em>past</em> Las Cruces?  Yes.</p>

<p>Do I need to know how far past Las Cruces?  No.</p>

<p>Am I ready?  No.</p>

<p>Journal entry?  No.</p>

<p>Check the oil?  Yes.</p>

<p>I checked the oil and it's fine.</p>

<p>Are we ready?  Yes.</p>

<p>859.1 miles since Dallas.</p>

<p class=date>4:01pm</p>

<p>It's actually 5:01pm CST as I'm back in Texas.</p>

<p>Very straight two lane highway here.  I drove straight 13 miles
from White's City toward El Paso.  Then veered right and crossed over
into Texas.  Short mountains loom ahead of me overlooked by the waning
sun.  I have a name for this type of terrain now: chihuahuan desert.
I imagine that is a proper name instead of a type of desert, but it
works for me for now.</p>

<p>Lots of rocks, lots of scrubby bushes; very little juniper.  Some
pear cactus, barbed wire fence on both sides of the highway.  Mostly
just some scrubby bushes I can't identify, but that look dark brown ab
out 3 feet high scattered to cover 35% of the terrain.</p>

<p>CCAUTION HIGH WINDS AHEAD.  Now that was a big warning sign.</p>

<p>Maybe I should drive with both hands on the wheel instead of just
one knee while typing.</p>

<p class=date>4:23pm</p>

<p>Wow.  A new record for Scott: coasting 80 mph downhill.  Coasting.
And that was with some brake application to keep me from going too
fast.</p>

<p>We're on the west side of the Guadalupe Mountains.  oh!  There's
the big sign again..  I'll turn around to get the picture.</p>

<p>See?  Big.  Scott was right beside the sign for the picture.</p>

<p class=date>4:39pm</p>

<p>What the hell is this?  No vegetation.  Just white.  Well a little
vegetation but nothing like before.  What is it?</p>

<p>Salt.  According to this historical marker:</p>

<pre>
RESENTMENT OVER PRIVATE CONTROL OF
  THE SALT LAKES IN THIS REGION,
  OFTEN CALLED GUADALUPE LAKES,
   LED TO THE EL PASO SALT WAR
              1877
 WHICH ENTAILED THE LOSS OF MANY
     LIVES AND MUCH PROPERTY
</pre>

<p>915.3 miles traveled since Dallas.</p>

<p class=date>5:59pm</p>

<p>Scott just pushed a guy in another Camry about 3 miles to a gas
station here in El Paso.  Easy, thanks to same height bumpers and nice
flat straight roads.</p>

<p>Waved adios to him as our cars disengaged.  I continued on to the
next gas station where I found fuel for 2 cents less per gallon:
$1.349</p>

<p>Just called Janette and Josephine to wish them howdy but no answer,
not even their machine.</p>

<p class=date>6:39pm</p>

<p>Wow El Paso is none too small.

<p>I kept thinking "okay this has got to be the end" but El Paso kept
coming and coming.  Then I realized I was on 62/180 and *not* on I-10
as I desired; had I missed it?  I stopped and looked at the map,
decided I had probably not missed the exit to I-10, continued on a bit
and realized I hadn't even made it onto the map yet!</p>

<p>Yup, El Paso is bigger than the one horse town I thought it was.
It even has a mountain sporting a big star worthy of the state
capitol.</p>

<p>Guess who's back?  Back again?  At Balmorhea, about to swim...</p>

<p>I might be crazy, but the pool here is spring fed and therefore "a
constant 78 degrees" which is not exactly warm, but it's as warm as
room temperature, and warmer than Barton Springs in Austin.</p>

<p>But the ambient temperature outside is a bit nippy and there seems
to be no concept of hot water in the men's washroom.</p>

<p>*<em>BUT</em>*, there is a warm air hand dryer that I can use to
warm up after a cool swim and ice cold shower.  Or maybe I'll say
forget the shower.</p>

<p>There's little fish in the water; I wonder if they'll chew on me.</p>

<p class=date>3:42pm</p>

<p>They did a little bit.  I got into the water way slowly cause it
felt so cold, and ultimately I have learned three things:</p>

<p>(!) It's okay for me to have fun just for fun's sake without having
to be sharing it with someone.  I almost didn't go swimming because
"it was cold" but the real reason is that I didn't have someone to
share the experience with - my brother, Dude, Janette, Sally -
anyone.  But I went anyway.</p>

<p>(@) A great new game without a name:  the bottom of the pool is
algae covered quite smooth and slick.  On tiptoes, I tried not to
slide into deeper water, but often ended up going deeper if I tried to
move.  I realized if I run in place, I mostly didn't go deeper into
the water, *and* I would warm myself up.  So the game would be best
played with Fred, as we frantically try to keep warm and not slide
deeper into water and gently try to nudge the other into deeper water
all at once.  Crazy.</p>

<p>(#) When taking a shower, the water was ice cold.  At first I was
all wussy shivery about it, and then I remembered my men's group
weekend, including non-hot showers (in November (oh hey it's our
anniversary)).  I just switched to non-cold mode.  Bang.  Feeling cold
sensation, but not reacting timidly, or even violently.  Just shower.
Stand dripping in the middle of the room in tadasan (sp) yoga standing
pose.  Warmth circulating through me.  Excellent.</p>

<p>($) Memories of Fred and I here years ago, running alongside the
canals of spring water.  Crystal clear and beautiful.</p>

<p class=date>3:53pm</p>

<p>Going to Carlsbad Caverns now.  I dunno how many miles away they
are.  640 miles driven so far.</p>

<p>I'm back in my car.  Holy fucking shit it's cold.</p>

<p class=date>3:39am</p>

<p>I walked over and saw a spring and smelled its freshness.  Now I'm
going to drive to Marfa, about 60 miles away.</p>

<p>I'm on 285 going north from Pecos, Texas.  Pecos!</p>

<p>Around me the land is flat flat flat flat.  With lots of green bush
cover.  Like whatever kind of plant we were cutting down at the U Bar
U ranch thing back in June or so.  Cedar bushes, plus a few yuccas
peeking over the top.  The soil looks like broken limestone maybe just
a bunch of rocks.  A single lonely windmill spinning with one vane
missing from its fan (which makes it easy to see that it's
turning).</p>

<p>The sun is considering setting over to my left.  Surface of the 2 lane
highway was rough rocks, and now I'm on highway under construction,
with "lookout!" markers in the center for there are no lines.  No
lights out here either; it would be tricky to drive this at night
without the markers I think.</p>

<p class=date>5:20pm</p>

<p>I just read the historical marker summary of Orla, Texas, which I
summarize as railroad town abandonded when freeway was built
nearby.</p>

<p>Another historical marker I summarize as some cat named Pope dug a
water well and struck water at 244 feet, but tried to go deeper to
find an Artesian flow, but the well collapsed before its value could
be determined.  I think that means it collapsed before it made money
or something.</p>

<p class=date>5:33pm</p>

<p>738 miles traveled and now i'm in New Mexico.  Super smooth asphalt
two lane highway.  30+ miles to Carlsbad.</p>

<p class=date>6:31pm</p>

<p>I just drove on a road that I thought was the right road according
to the map and its directions, but it was numbereed differently than
what the map said.  i tried it anyway, and it as the right road.
Close to Carlsbad Caverns now.</p>

<p class=date>7:10pm</p>

<p>Despite signs saying "no overnight camping" in various places, I'm
going to park here at a scenic outlook on the way up to Carlsbad
Caverns.  I made it all the way up to the caverns and coasted back
down and perfectly remembered where this outlook was located, *and* I
just turned over 800.2 miles on my trek, so it's a good place to stop
for the night.</p>

<p>I need to remember and subtract one hour from each time since I got
to NM.</p>

<p class=date>6:13pm</p>

<p>It's fixed now.</p>

<p>Wow that was fun.  Scottie's check engine light just came on out in
the middle of the dark highway 17 south.  I was smart enough to put a
quart of oil in my front floorboard instead of in my trunk where I'd
have to take off my bike and bike rack to get to it, so I am thankful
for that.  I don't have a flashlight to see what I'm doing so I tried
using Scott's headlights and reflect them to inside the engine, but
that didn't really work. so I used my computer screen to light the
engine.  Oil is low.  More oil in and now we are off to Marfa
hopefully with no problems.  Except that I spilled some oil on the
valve cover and on the bumper.</p>

<p class=date>4:05am</p>

<p>494.1 miles traveled.</p>

<p class=date>5:12am</p>

<p>546.6 miles traveled.  I'm in Marfa.  I can see why Jack hates this
town.  Not even the gas stations are open 24 hours.  I'm parked behind
Thunderbird Restaurant to sleep.</p>

<p>On the way here, I went through Fort Davis (city, not the fort) and
a fox(?) ran across the road close in front of me.  And then a black
cat did as well.  I could only see that cat's eyes.</p>
