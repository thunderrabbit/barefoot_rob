<p>So much to be happy for! Great weather, great wife, happy bare feet,
holiday, seats on the train, going to see Travis and Yumi, at Kids&rsquo;
Country no less!</p>

<p>Lin has been indoctrinated to not let the cat outside, so Jennie is
going a bit stir crazy, peeing on Mama&rsquo;s futon (twice) and now it&rsquo;s
being tossed in the trash ($100 wasted) despite my please to spend
$100 to have it cleaned by a cat-pee-centric cleaning place.  Because
of Lin&rsquo;s indoctrination, her mom is indoctrinated to not let Jennie
out so on our way out as Jennie is <em>begging</em> to go out, I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;we
should let her out; will your mom be here today?&rdquo; so Lin asked her mom
if she&rsquo;ll just open the door for the cat but her mom is like ohh it&rsquo;s
better if you guys are here because her mom doesn&rsquo;t want to feel
responsible in case any of the things that could possibly happen to
Jennie (get a disease, win the lottery) happen.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m glad at least Lin was open to the idea and says we can let
Jennie out tomorrow.  Yay!</p>

<p>So we left and got on the bus (freezing cold with AC grr why waste
energy) and then I realized that the phone in my pocket is my camera,
not my phone. dammit.  I left my phone at home.</p>

<p>At least I have my camera (and Francois).</p>

<p>Fortunately we made our train connection ギリギリ, and we have seats
together.  So I&rsquo;ll stop being grouchy and just say fuckit to my phone
and have a good day.</p>

<p class="dream">
Climbed up a light pole and found some eggs whihch were soft, but
viable bird eggs and I  placed some which were above a line down below
the line just to do it, and while I was there, one of them started to
hatch.  A little video game bird came out and was attracted to the
video screen.  I realized it was a simlation of sort, the bird was
attracted to the sceand the scene itself was changing through a
different rndomzider.  I enterd the scene as well and found some
points where I should dig being highlighted by slightly jumping upward
like a  quite simple but obvious "pick me" or "dig here" so I went to
the spots in turn and founa bunch of idential keys with non-identical
clues as to where the lock was for the keys.  I din't read them, but
started to put the caches back away in the sand and one of them
wouldn't quite go back down into its hole, and then a guy came up
behind us and announced "everyone, I opened the ceiling to my room and
it got filled with sand" and I expected him to say 'so don't do that"
but he continued, "and everyone has been nominated to help clean up.
Johnson, Steve, Rabbit, Cindy, all of you come in her and help"
</p>

<p>and then Lin came in to wake me up.</p>

<p>I just finished Mike&rsquo;s latest book, <em>The Last</em>.  It&rsquo;s a really
interesting story set in the real world, just three years from now.
Quite an easy read except for the queasy parts which I almost had to
put down!  The story leaves some unanswered questions, and lends
itself to more books, which I hope he writes soon!</p>

<p>I was surprised by the plot twists; it seemed so simple at first!
Interesting to wonder what I would do if I found myself in the main
character&rsquo;s situation: the last man alive in a city full of zombies!!</p>

<p>The story is not as complex as Mike&rsquo;s other work, and focuses on just
a couple main characters (not counting the rarely-distinguishable
zombies of course!)  It&rsquo;s primarily written in first person, and what
a ride!</p>

<p>Looking forward to the world more fleshed out; hopefully the series
will be a detailed mega-thriller!</p>

<p>In Harajuku now at a hat store.  We went to see art by Magritte which
was pretty cool and made me realize I&rsquo;ll never be a famous artist (if
I don&rsquo;t keep drawing things).  Then Sarupapa treated us to some cream
filled bread things which were pretty good though maybe not worth the
line in which we waited nor the price he paid. hrmm.</p>

<li>Golden week is this week. That means lots of time off.</li>
<li>Lin was involved in an accident a couple weeks ago. She&rsquo;s shrugged it off with flying colors save for the bruise on her leg.</li>
<li>She&rsquo;s been workin&rsquo; lots recently.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve just agreed to work each Tuesday with Sho on projects he&rsquo;s got going on</li>
<li>Might do some work for R at A in E, but not sure yet. Will talk to him tomorrow to see what he has in mind.</li>
<li>Have had one Skype lesson with Chieri, via Mutsumi. They are scheduled for Mondays.</li>
<li>Ted hasn&rsquo;t come back since he got out about a month ago.</li>
<li>I haven&rsquo;t been doing 100 pushups every day, but I&rsquo;ve been considering it!</li>
<li>I have been working on pong; and recently added background music which increases in volume as game play progresses.  It&rsquo;s really neat!</li>
<li>Meeting Mutsumi and her husband + Bruno and his wife to see some art by Magritte today.  I thought she had misspelled Maglite at first (or is it Maglight?)</li>
<li>Weather is nice; I&rsquo;m barefoot today.</li>
<li>Today there&rsquo;s apparently a big fight between two boxers.  I&rsquo;ve heard of one of them.</li>

<p>On my way home yesterday there was an ambulance and police car next to
traffic light near our house.  Lin&rsquo;s uncle was there and he goes
&ldquo;Lin&rsquo;s in the ambulance&rdquo;</p>

<p>!!!</p>

<p>Holy shit wait what?</p>

<p>I was so relieved to see her alert and essentially &ldquo;fine&rdquo; though it&rsquo;s
still super spooky fuck fuck fuck!</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t have my computer at the time so I didn&rsquo;t write about it last
night.</p>

<p>Right now she is talking to a guy from her insurance company I think,
explaining the situation.</p>

<p>For some reason, no one got the car driver&rsquo;s insurance information
last night, even though police were called and documented the
accident.</p>

<p>The lady said she didn&rsquo;t know the insurance info, and didn&rsquo;t give any
info except her own name and phone number.</p>

<p>She said she&rsquo;d have her insurance people call, but they haven&rsquo;t yet
(which is why I&rsquo;m starting to document this situation).</p>

<p>After the accident, Lin&rsquo;s mom and aunt happened across her; they were
going to eat dinner in the nearby restaurant.  I don&rsquo;t know when her
uncle arrived.  I arrived on my way home, saw him, and he told me to
go back to the ambulance.</p>

<p>Lin&rsquo;s mom and aunt were in there with her, and Lin said she&rsquo;d prefer
to have me with her and they went to dinner while Lin and I went to
the hosptial.</p>

<p>We were in the ambulance for a bit while they asked a couple questions
about allergies and sorted out an available hospital.  We went to
Saiwai Hospital in Kawasaki.</p>

<p>They took a CT scan which the radiologist said appears normal.</p>

<p class="dream"> At a shop selling food: healthy brown rice and stuff
cooked, I bought something and was counting things I had bought: a lot
of empty bottles and received 20,000 yen change but hadn't paid that
much.  The employee said it was okay so I kept it, but didn't
understand the logic.  But I couldn't remember the overall transaction
so assumed it was correct. She asked if I want to have some brown rice
and I was like, "sure!" and she seemed a bit taken aback that I had
accepted her offer, and I countered with "you can use the rice I just
bought" but she ignored me and went into the back to get something.

<hr />

<p class="dream"> Outside at a park with outdoor concrete table and
Maggie and some guys we didn't know, one passerby took a photo of his
friend's butt, who was like, "hey that's my butt! don't post that
photo" and I joked "well if it's just the butt you have pluasible
deniability: 'that's not my butt!'"  and I said as an aside to Maggie,
but then what if the uncropped photo is released? oops!" and she
laughed.  The guy realized we were friends and offered / asked to take
our picutre.  We put our heads together and I put my arm around her
and the cameraguy asked where we were connected, as if it made a
difference for the photo.  I said at the shoulder and then another guy
came up and got into the photo on Maggie's other side.  I realized I
