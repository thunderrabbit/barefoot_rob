<p>It almost seems like every day I wake up smoothly just seconds
  before my alarm goes off.  I'm really thankful for that.</p>

<br>Yeah, I wake up at 6:59 these days and my alarm usually goes off at 7. How do our bodies and minds DO that?! It&rsquo;s definitely something to be thankful for. It eases the alarm buzzer shell shock.</p>

  password and then I recovered it and then he reset it, but he
  didn't tell me to what he reset it, so again I don't know what my

<p>I'm going to bed soon.</p>

<p>Colleen wrote me a letter and I wrote her back immediately; it
  feels good to have accomplished that.</p>

<p>I still don't know the reset password to my site.</p>

<p>Today Clayton taught じゅんこ the lyric "I love it when you call me
  big poppa" and the phrase "whatchoo talkin' bout foo?"  It's really
  cute/funny to hear her say these.</p>

<p>Morag was unげんき at the beginning of her day, but she genkked up
  after that.   I texted her to see if she would like to hang or chow
  with me tonight but never got a reply.  So much for text me
  anytime, I guess.</p>

<p>Work was fucked up busy at first and I had early lunch, but no one
  tupattsued which makes things much smoother.  I think this is the
  first non-topattsu Saturday in a while.   (that term is what we say
  when someone calls in sick. I'm not sure if it's Japanese or where
  it came from (or how to spell it))</p>

<p>Okay bedtime.</p>

<p>I noticed my computer wasn't in my backpack, therefore decided I
  must not need to bring it to work today; it is rather heavy to carry
  around all the time, and I can't use it so much due to the battery
  suckage (don't get sidetracked don't get sidetracked) so, even
  though I'll have time between lesson and work, I'm not taking my
  computer; I'll just practice Japanese writing, not typing.</p>

<p>Hung out with Miki tonight after work.  Grar; what am I doing?</p>

<p>Studying, for one thing.</p>

<p>Miki doesn't know that I'm considering staying.  I don't know if
  I'm considering staying.  I don't know what I'm doing in Japan.  I
  don't really think I can go back home; I don't really have a
  concrete plan for anything, but I know I don't really want to sign
  up for Nova again in March.  The reason: I don't go to work all
  happy; I'm more like counting the hours until I can go home.</p>

<p>I'm proud of myself and of who I am.</p>

<p>I'm proud of janette for doing her work.</p>

<p>I'm proud of myself for doing my work.</p>

<p>Today in the shower I mentally told Neil off in the break room.
  All Warrior, nothing sideways.</p>

<p>But I judge my work is not a safe container.  It is, however, what
  I make of it.</p>

<p>I get that I'm losing some of the skills that I learned in my
  I-group.  Less often do I integrate the 4-point protocol for
  clearing.  I wonder about that.</p>

<p>(wonder how much is more a part of me than I know, if there are
  warriors in Japan, if I can bring it here (a project I've...  hmmm
  (new idea brewing)), wonder if I'm just a silly rabbit)</p>

<p>The old idea was to save Japan from itself.  Fuck Japan. (*) I need
  this for myself.</p>

<p>The new idea: start going to 12 step meetings for myself.  Start
  with AA, which I know exists in abundance in Tokyo, and see if
  there exists the 12 step meeting that I need.  I wonder if I can
  start that meeting.</p>

  thing at a time and throw all my energy into it.  _Rob's Roller
  Coaster Roundup_, janette, Miki, study Japanese, clean my room, 12
  step meetings, work)</p>

<p>(*) Let Japan live at it has.  From Jon:</p>

<pre>I don't know when you wrote this, maybe it was early, but by now
you may know that Japan has a long history with Americans trying to
change Japanese culture, starting with Admiral Perry in the mid 19th
Century. They have succesfully resisted missionaries (the Koreans
became Presbyterians almost overnight) and total occupation and an
imposition of a constitution upon them by the United States. But the
underlying core of their culture is intact, based on their warrior
code, which dates back to the 13th century.</pre>

<p>I remember him saying it would take about 2 or 3 hours to drive to
  日光。 Fair enough.  That's how long it took the tour bus.</p>

<p>It took 6 hours each way.</p>

<p>Mate.  Six hours.</p>

<p>We were <em>in</em> Nikko approximately 1 hour.  We saw a waterfall
  I had never seen, (uh oh, deja vu is happening), the waterfall we
  saw through clouds on the tour (no clouds this time), and the temple
  we saw on the tour (no rain this time).</p>

<p>I did get pictures.</p>

<p>My god what a long day of driving, and so many beautiful places to
  stop, but we just drove drove drove.</p>

<p>Traffic was a nightmare.  We drove through little-ass cities, each
  with fifty lights in a row, non-synchronized, single lanes with a
  jillion fuckin' people trying to get through.</p>

<p>And, I had to <em>peeeeeeeee</em>.</p>

<p>AND, though I didn't turn on my computer today, it went from 100%
  to 49% battery during our 13 hours.  Now it's down to 17% battery in
  the, let's see, 6 minutes it's taken me to write this entry.</p>

<p>Six minutes?  Well, not flat out typing; I'm writing this as I go
  blah blabh whatthefuck ever</p>

<p>I'm on the train, have 12% battery and that's maybe enough to
  describe all the thoughts I thunk while ridin' around crowded rural
  Japan.</p>

<p>I flat decided I would not see Miki tonight; I told her I'd call
  her if I got home soon enough, but then I was like fuckit; talking
  to janette is <em>far</em> more important at this juncture and I
  texted Miki to say sorry ol' chap.  I told her generally the
  situation; that I like her and janette's not happy about that and
  I'm feeling crummy about not being able to maintain focus for an
  extended remix relationship.  A mix, maybe, but certainly not an
  extended remix.</p>

<p>She's like roger doger and I'm left wondering wtf is up in my
  mind.  wtf I'm supposed to be doing, wtf is the point of all this
  insanity and wtf to tell janette.</p>

<p>If I get no input from janette then she should still come to Japan
  and I won't see Miki while janette is here and I won't do more than
  hang with Miki before janette gets here.</p>

<p>If I get negative feedback from janette, then I'm like send my
  shit to Maggie's house and I'll buy 1/2 your Japan ticket and we
  both do whatever we want.</p>

<p>If I get positive feedback from janette, I have to stick with my
  first option.</p>

<p>I'm home now.  Have nearly finished eating (it's like gorging;
  today I've eaten two rice balls with a dab of sushi each, so I
  think I'm hungry and I just chowed this shit down) and I'm going to
  call janette in 55 minutes.</p>

<p>I think meditation is in order.  I think one of my patented (*)
  Typewritten Meditations is in order.</p>

<p>(*) not patented</p>
