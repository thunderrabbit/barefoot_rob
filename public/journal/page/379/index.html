<p>Fuck.</p>

<p>I lost my hotel key.</p>

<p class=date>3:41pm</p>

<p>Okay.  I'm in my room but still no key.  I paid 2100 yen because I
lost my key, but when I asked for another to get into my room they
said they would have to make it.</p>

<p>Maybe she meant they have to go get it.  But I'm up in my room with
no key, while I should be out looking all the places I've been to find
it.  I've got all my shit dumped out onto my bed from my backpack
which is the only thing I had with me.</p>

<p class=date>3:43pm</p>

<p>Okay.  I called the front desk and told them I'm going to go look
for it.  They said my new one would be ready in two hours.</p>

<p class=date>5:06pm</p>

<p>Wow.  What a rollercoaster.  I *almost* left my room and thought,
"what if someone found my key and comes to take all my stuff
(computer) while I'm gone?"  I flipped a coin, "heads means I'll do
something about protecting my stuff.."  it was tails.  My stuff will
be safe.</p>

<p>I've gone from feeling like an idiot lost in a world where I cannot
speak nor read the language, carefully repeating "sumimasen," which is
a general "I'm sorry" good for slight bumps or inconveniences, then "I
lost my key" in slow words while pointing to my piece of paper on
which one of the people downstairs wrote in Japanese "charge for
losing key" on the receipt I received after paying 2100 yen.</p>

<p>Once I realized it didn't say "I lost my key," I had someone else
write "I lost my key" on a different piece of paper, but the kanji
looked close enough that I thought it was the same thing.</p>

<p>People who didn't know English gave me various responses when I
showed the first paper.  One cop showed me where the hotel is.
Close.</p>

<p>A girl soliciting money for the apparently helpless people who live
on a volcanic island and have no food could speak enough English to
tell me "same" when pointing to English "I LOST MY KEY" and the
Japanese script on the <em>second</em> piece of paper.  Ah.</p>

<p>Showed the second piece of paper and got faster results.  "Nope, no
key here, bub," but in Japanese of course.</p>

<p>In the building where the Nova office is located, one cat said,
"you follow please" and I followed him up an elevator and to a room
that said "EMERGENCY" where I showed the correct piece of paper.  They
hadn't seen a key.</p>

<p>Up to the Nova office where I had been for a second to see Cookie
(turns out he saw some of the others (Andrew, Janelle, Kevin I'm
guessing) meet up, but they weren't actually "by the clock" which is
where I understood we were to meet.  I didn't really think they'd be
there, which is why I didn't search around too much, but just wrote a
letter to Colleen sitting exactly underneath the huge clock).  They
hadn't seen a key either.</p>

<p>Back downstairs to where I had purchased stationery for writing
said letter.  Showed the second piece of paper and the woman instantly
said "ah" and turned around, grabbed the key.</p>

<p>"Arigato, arigato"  Thank you thank you.</p>

<p>Though I had intentionally kept my mood up, suddenly my mood
launched. I sang to myself:</p>

<pre>
"I found my key
I'm so happy
Everyone look at me
cause I found my key"
</pre>

<p>All the way back to the hotel.  I smilingly showed they key to one
of the girls who had helped me.  Up to the front desk I showed the key
and the receipt.  He took both and then gave me my 2100 yen back.</p>

<p>"But I still need a key."</p>

<p>"Ah, just one second please."</p>

<p>After a bit he returned with a new key.  Fair enough.</p>

<p>Back in my room I'm like, "I AM THE MOST POWERFUL MAN IN THE
WORLD!!!" for having negotiated through all of that to get my key and
my 2100 yen back, jack.  Aright.</p>

<p>I paid 500 yen for lunch (plenty to eat) and walked to my new work,
which is on the fifth floor of a five story building, the bottom two
stories of which are filled with a pachinko parlor.  Big half naked
sexy cartoon characters on signs out front lure people in.</p>

<p>After looking around the Nova classroom space (four or five small
rooms and only 2 being used) I walked to my apartment for the first
time.  The guy who I'll be replacing answered the door and I got to
see inside a bit.  Small.  Have to duck my head to get into the main
living area.  I didn't see my room because Frank was sleeping in there
aparently.</p>

<p>I got a letter!  The winner of the First Letter To Rob in Japan
contest is Colleenie Beanie!!</p>

<p>I ate my lunch by the river under a bridge (over which I'll cross
each day as I take the 15 minute walk from my apartment to work)</p>

<p>Now I'm on the train back to my hotel.</p>

<p>I still don't have the train system perfectly figured out.  I keep
getting buzzed like my tickets are invalid, but I'll keep trying
various options until I figure it out.  Most recently I decided at the
last minute the train I almost boarded was in fact the correct train,
but the doors were closing and smushed my hand as I tried to bully
them open.  "Sorry about your hand, but the train can't be late."</p>

<p>Ah.  Something significant clicked for me in figuring out the
subway system.  Just poring over the maps, and the arrival pack
information about where I'm supposed to go and how I'll get there.</p>

<p>This will be easy.</p>

<p>Just gotta learn some kanji.</p>

<p>D'oh.  I still can't figure out how to display kanji in my HTML.
Well, specifically I can't find an editor on my computer that will
write kanji in a plaintext.  Gotta figure out some encoding
stuff.</p>

<p>Okay, go go go go forget typing kanji for now.</p>

<p>Erg.</p>

<p>I've just taken a big ol' nap in my hotel room after watching some
kids (?) on skateboards down in a skate park 15 floors below.  I'm
conflicted in several departments: feeling a little bit sick in my
guts like diarrhea, feeling <em>extremely</em> dry like chapped lips,
feeling a bit coughy like tickly in my throat, and feeling a tiny bit
head-achey like a headache.</p>

<p>I also want to get out to an internet cafe and post my journal
entries.</p>

<p>Pulled myself out of the warm bed, converted birthday suit to pants
and thick long sleeve shirt, grabbed my computer, realized I don't
have a CAT 5 cable with me.   D'oh.</p>

<p>Am I scared of being embarassed at language barrier about how to
ask for a CAT 5 cable?  Yes.  Am I using my sickness as an excuse to
not go?  Yes.  Am I taking better care of myself by blasting through
my fear or by sleeping off my headache?  Dunno.</p>

<p>Things I've done today: navigated myself through part of Tokyo
train system to apply for my alien registration and see my apartment,
figured out a photo machine in Japanese, got lost trying to follow
directions given to me by the guy at the apartment on where to find a
nice place to eat my lunch, got reoriented (no pun intended) and ate
lunch on the river, renavigated myself back to train station, used a
public squat-over-a-hole toilet, got lost going out the wrong exit of
the train station near my apartment, recovered thanks to small map
given to me by Nova and augmented by Fiona to show my hotel location,
...  </p>

<p>Okay, I'll let myself go back to sleep without further
self-bashing.</p>

<p>To do tomorrow: 
<br>(!) get chapstick slash lip balm of some variety
<br>(@) search for a way to upload journal entries, 
<br>(#) meet Andrew, Cookie, et. al. at 2pm under the big clock in the
building where Nova's Tokyo head office is located.</p>

<p>I'm a legal alien
<br>oh, I'm a legal alien
<br>I'm a legal alien
<br>in Japan</p>

<p>(almost)</p>

<p>I'm at the ward office in my local area to get registered.  Made it
here from the train station with the handy dandy map Nova gave me.</p>

<p>Total tons of information pouring into my brain.  Brain in high
overdrive doing huge amounts of pattern matching and memorizing
matches.  Brains are pretty awesome.  I like mine.</p>

<p>Oh, a cool thing was getting my photo taken in a little photo booth
by the train station.  Luckily there was an image of a passport photo
(complete with dimensions describing how big it should be) and I
matched the japanese name on the image to an item in a list of names
on the screen, apparently describing the types of photos to be
taken.</p>

<p>After the picture was taken, I hit not the green button but the do
it over button, so I was a bit surprised when it wanted to take my
picture again though I hadn't paid again.  But I figured out what must
have happened and pushed the right button to get the photos.</p>

<p>I'm in Japan.  Just met Andrew, a cat from Sacramento.  He's been
on a trip across Asia (Laos, Burma, Thailand, Taiwan, Macau, Viet Nam,
Hong Kong, NZ, OZ, Samoa, Tonga), has a brother in Hawaii.  He'll be
staying Kokubunji in Tokyo.  He requested Chiba and got Tokyo.  I
requested Tokyo and got Yokohama.  That's hilarious.</p>

<p>He also journals, emails them out to his peeps.</p>

<p>Awesome!  He just got back from Auckland New Zeeeeealand!  Was
there for 18 months going to school.  Wowza!</p>

<p>He's trying to get a citizenship in NZ.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Have also met Kevin & Janelle (married, will be placed in
Ichihara), Ryan (I think that's his name (he broke his hand snow
skiing)). And others others others.</p>

<p>Our person who met us here (Cookie, but I think he spelled his name
for me Kwok) looks like a Japanese version of ... ooooh I can't think
of his name.... UU YA cat up in Oregon, and he has a British
accent.</p>

<p>On a train with Andrew (Dru Daddy G), Justin & Tara (married) who
will be placed in Sendai.</p>

<p>We're being spoon fed train tickets and such for now.  This ride is
just over an hour it turns out.  Assigned seats.  I know the symbol
for car (train car only?) now.  It looks like the top view of a
formula car with axels, but no wheels.  Or a sideways tie fighter even
though Andrew refuses to watch Star Wars.</p>

<p class=date>6:48pm</p>

<p>I'm in Japan!  I'm in Japan!  I'm in Japan!!!  How is it not really
sinking in?  Andrew was all, "yeah, no matter where I go, I wanna go
somewhere else that sounds cooler," or something like that.</p>

<p>"But now you're stuck here for a year..."</p>

<p>Most amazing is how clean this place is!  And people with colds
wear little white masks like surgeons to keep from spreading germs.
Almost like a fashion statement.</p>

<p class=date>7:29pm</p>

<p>D'oh!  I just realized I left my hat on the plane.  Like a dark
green Gilligan hat.</p>

<p>It seems that I've got my biological clock synched up enough with
Japan that I'll be allllll good.</p>

<p>Cookie brought me and Andrew to the train station (I forget the
name) and Fiona (another (ex-(?))instructor) met us and she led me to
my hotel.  I'm totally staying in a hotel for three nights and will be
met here by AdrienneG on Sunday I think to take me to my
apartment.</p>

<p>My bags will be brought to the apartment by ABC, the courier in the
airport where everyone dropped off their stuff.</p>

<p>Fiona is from Australia, though I first guessed South Africa, New
Zealand, and Britain before she politely said, "you're missing a big
island in the middle."</p>

<p>"Australia?"</p>

<p>I dropped off my bag in my hotel room, which is pretty small.  A
bit smaller than a motel room might be in the US.  And it's got a
bidet toilet thing.  Whoah.  And a super deep bath tub!  Like fully
two feet deep.  Hey, maybe it just looks deep cause it's so short.
Nevermind.</p>

<p>Um, oh, then Fiona showed me to the building that contains the NOVA
Headquarters for Eastern Japan.  They're based in a 30 story building
shaped like the Hyatt Regency in downtown Houston (rooms on perimeter
only, huge 30 story tall empty space in the middle) with restaurants
on the top two levels.  I walked around until someone greeted me
helpfully and I spent 1440 yen ($12) on five different types of sushi
(one piece each) and water.  The cat gave me a free coke.</p>

<p>Each piece of sushi... oh wait they were cooked... anyway, they
were each on a little skewer.  I put the skewer back on the tray from
which they were being served and the cook told me in Japanese (and
showed me in kinesthetics) that they go into the gaping mouth of the
ceramic frog sitting up on the counter.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Got a bit lost on the way back to the hotel (I went out a different
entrance and ended up walking underground about a block, so I didn't
know which way I was going relative to where I had been) but made it
back.  Oh, and that was after I went to the NOVA office and the
Japanese girl didn't understand me, "I'm just exploring; I don't need
any help," and ended up getting Fiona for me.  That was a bit
embarassing; I don't want Fiona to think that I'm a big fat baby, but
I explained to her what happened and asked her a question anyway:
where is the nearest internet cafe?</p>

<p>Found out, came back to the hotel to get my computer, decided
fuckit I'm too tired.  Though it doesn't seem like it's possible, my
calculations say that it's been 24 hours since I left Dallas.</p>

<p class=date>10:19pm JST Thursday 27 March 2003</p>

<p>If I'm 15 hours ahead of Dallas, then it's 10:19am minus 3 hours =
7:19am CST Thursday 27 March.  I've been awake a long time; I'm going
to sleeeeep.   Tomorrow = Get My Alien Registration Day.</p>

<p>LEVEL ORANGE SEARCH IN PROGRESS sounds pretty menacing to me as we
approached the entry gates to the airport, but the search consisted of
one person with a flashlight peering into the car from one side
only.</p>

<p>What could they possibly find that way?</p>

<p class=date>7:01am</p>

<p>Fucking Airplane Day.  Stealing from me 2 hours of time that I
could otherwise use to chat with Janette.  She's stuck behind the
glass, behind the security gates.  The X-ray guy saw a knife looking
thing in my bag and it got checked.  Letter opener.  They let me
through with it.  It's not a sharp letter opener.  It's made of
silver; hand made.  By my dad I think.</p>

<p>I waved to Janette once I made it through.  Thanks to her for
staying; I could have given the opener to her to take home.  I watched
her turn quickly away once I appeared focused on walking.  She floated
down the escalator.  Bye Janette for a year maybe.  Unless you come
visit.</p>

<p>So now I'm crying.  I'm leaving my home for a year, to a foreign
land I've never previously visited.  What the fuck am I
thinking???</p>
