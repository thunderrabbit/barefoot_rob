<p>Such a nice lesson tonight!  This was my first time to meet these
students; they are three lovely women, two of whom are retired, one of
whom does not have a computer nor TV!  Wow!</p>

<p>We laughed a lot and they asked lots of questions and tried lots of
speaking; I need to learn from them!</p>

<p>Also great: there are plenty of seats on the train on the way back.</p>

<p>Well, Hexo <em>looks</em> great without any modification, and handled my
journal directory without complaints&hellip;  but it&rsquo;s slowwww (with
entries spanning 23 years (and more to come after I port years
199-2004)).</p>

<p>Middleman had some complaints, and looks like ass, but it&rsquo;s fast!!!</p>

<p>I fixed the complaints (boo hoo the date in filename doesn&rsquo;t match the
date in frontmatter.  who fuckin&rsquo; cares?  Use one to override the
other!), and I assume someone has written a theme or two for
Middleman.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;calendar&rdquo; add-on(?) doesn&rsquo;t show anything like a calendar; it&rsquo;s
just some year/month indices.  Mmmaybe I&rsquo;ll find something and
mmmmmmmmmmaaaayyybbbe I&rsquo;ll write something to do it.</p>

<p>Oh, and Middleman doesn&rsquo;t use the same markdown that I&rsquo;m used to.  If
I put double tildes across text <del>like this</del>, I like the
strikethrough markup.  But Middleman just renders the tildes.  Gotta
figure out how to tell it which markdown to use.</p>

<p>##22:17</p>

<p><a href="https://forum.middlemanapp.com/t/markdown-strikethrough/1030">Fixed the strikethrough thing</a> with <a href="https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet">:redcarpet</a></p>

<p>In <code>Gemfile</code>:</p>

<p>Headed to Chez Soness to help her record some videos for her latest
project/product.  Cool stuff!</p>

<p>##16:39</p>

<p>Fun times!  We had lunch and converted Chez Soness into Studio Soness
and then recorded several takes of her latest
<a href="https://show-n-tell.us">Show-n-Tell US</a> video.  Dogs and jets
augmented the soundtrack after we got her script tweaked.  Try again
tomorrow!</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m headed to first lesson in Akihabara, which should become a
weekly event.</p>

<p>##17:17</p>

<p>D&rsquo;oh!  This train terminates in Shinagawa.</p>

<p>##17:27</p>

<p>yay!  I got a seat on the next train leaving Shinagawa.</p>

<p>I was a minute late to A and C&rsquo;s lesson, but they were 5 and 20 minutes
late, respectively.  whew!</p>

<p>We hadn&rsquo;t seen C in three weeks so I asked A to ask some questions
about C&rsquo;s latest adventures. I took notes on two separate sheets of
paper on which I made corrections and then had them do the same
conversation again, but using the new phrases.  I hope it was helpful!</p>

<p>At the end, each student got their own page with corrections.</p>

<p>Yesterday I worked several hours trying to get my AWS instance to talk
to an RDS instance on a VPC.  I set &ldquo;Publically accessable&rdquo; to true,
set the Security group to (wide open/allow the AWS instance security
group), but I still couldn&rsquo;t connect.</p>

<p>My great idea now is to create an AMI based on the AWS instance, then
spin up a new instance of the AMI in the same VPC as the RDS.  I&rsquo;m 99%
sure that will solve the problem (for the major bulk of the data,
which doesn&rsquo;t change); then I just have to toss over a couple of
tables via PHPMyAdmin.</p>

<p>I hope that maintainer is making money; I&rsquo;ve used the shit out of
PHPMyAdmin and never paid a bit.</p>

<p>Yesterday around 17:43, JB called me all, &ldquo;yeah can you come teach
from 6pm to 9pm <em>today</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That worked out nicely!  I had asked JB for a single lesson <em>off</em>
yesterday, so I could go to Kagoshima.  I was therefore scheduled not
to work, but got 3 hours instead of 1.  Thank you, angels!</p>

<p>While there, JB offered me 1.5 hours of lessons on Thursday nights.
That&rsquo;s tonight, right after I hang out with Soness!</p>

<p>I spent the better part of the weekend playing with Middleman, hosted
on netlify.</p>

<p>It does several of the things I want, but no automagic indices on
subdirectories and definitely no calendar-shaped navigation.</p>

<p>Today I had three more hours of lessons than I normally have on
Tuesdays.  In addition to Akabanebashi and Mutsumis, I taught at
Toshiba near Kawasaki station.  It worked out well because Lin took
today off work and we got to chow lunch at Lazona after I finished at
2pm.</p>

<p>After lunch, we smooched and I headed to Ebisu to chill with Nate for
a bit.  He bought a new cute+cool domain that I haven&rsquo;t set up yet,
but will soon.  It&rsquo;s just for Redmine installation which is already
set up on Linode so no biggie.</p>

<p>I went to toy shop, but they were chatting with &ldquo;real&rdquo; customers so I
didn&rsquo;t stay long.</p>

<p>Oh I didn&rsquo;t mention last week when I went in, one of the employees
asked me to show her the secret to a four-piece wooden puzzle.  I had
solved it two weeks prior, after the other employees and customers had
given up on it.  At that time, I had thought <em>gimme dat</em>, but was
like, 「できる、できる」 &ldquo;I can do it&rdquo; and solved it just before I had
to go.  So anyway, last week, I solved it in a trice.  &ldquo;Like this&rdquo;
<em>shjoop</em> done.</p>

<p>In a large field with lots of peole as a spinning flying contraption came down.  It had a large ring on its owter borader so it whn it came down near me, I was able to grab it.  It had conventional fans to keep it aloft, but it was still intersting and a guy climbed onto it to see how it worked.  he shone his flashlight inside and saw chsts of drawers whcih surprised us, but then he got off and we let it go, but unfortunately  some kids had climbed onto it and they fel one by one.  They all survived, but were in a bit of shock.  No one came to help them, but they found each other and walked off haarm in arm.</p>

<hr />

<p>At a school where I hadn&rsquo;t been before., I was looking for a lock for my locker.  I asked if they had locks for sale or rent but they didn&rsquo;t know the word lock. I explained it in thersms of lockers, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a hole here and it&rsquo;s a device that fits through the hole and keeps it locked.&rdquo;  Ah yes, I might be able to get one from a company down the street.  Prince Joffrey from GoT was teling me how to get there and I insulted him a bit (intentiaonaly, not afraid of him) and he was a bit surprised but  didn&rsquo;t retaliate hah</p>

<p>There was an interesting lock mechanism consisteing of a ball track, but it had different sized balls and  a squirrel cage fblower and I tried to figure out how it all worked, and was surprised by how empty it was after I took off its cover.</p>

<p>I got back to my stuff and my phone was ringing; it was my dad, but I couldn&rsquo;t answer it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve essentially given up on Pelican, Middleman, Metalsmith, and maybe
one other.  I&rsquo;m still looking at Hexo, Nanoc, Jekyll, and others.</p>
