<p>The best of both worlds.</p>

<pre>
somewhere there is an answer

it might not be the right answer but

it's possible that I am not being given guidance for what I'm supposed
to do in the world; maybe I asked specifically for no guidance.  maybe
for reasons I don't know, no guidance can be given.

Maybe I'm asking the wrong questions.

Anyone who is in their right mind cannot know what they are to do in
the world.

People occasionally slip out of their mind and peek, but this is more
the exception than the rule.

I can't explain in English why this is true.

It's possible that no matter where I go, I will be able to figure out
something cool to do.

let's assume this, which means it doesn't matter where I go.   And
therefore it doesn't matter what I do or what kids I have or who I
marry or anything else.

this reminds me of Ram Dass.

Let's say that the

after this entry, write to Rebecca.  Find emails for her and write
her. (*)

let's say that the palm reader guy was wrong about one thing: that my
job is to not become attached to anything until I find the right
thing.  This would look like me not know what is the right thing, but
each thing has equal potential of, actually, each thing is the right
thing in its (my) own way.

"What has the gene pool gained by having a guy float around and decide
everything is not good enough to do?"

So if I grant myself the belief that if I get married, I won't be
missing my Life Ship, will I let myself get married?  

(um, no)

Then what is it?

Fear of something unknown.

Why do you think you even want to get married?

(mirror:)  Because if I get married, then I've found someone that I
can trust enough with my everything forever.  But really that means I
trust myself.  Mirror.

Ah.  Very interesting.  How will you know if you trust yourself?

Ummmmmmm.
</pre>

<p>Sidetracked.  My glasses</p>

<p>Oh, this is interesting.   I have noticed recently my ability to
  mis-align priorities.  Like the time I was like, Self, you march
  yourself right up there and talk to the apartment guy.  Just do
  it.  And I walked up there and he spoke zip-nothing of English and
  I'm like, "fuck" and told him I'd call a friend.  Called Liz and
  she's like cool, and I was focused on getting her to come to the
  apartment locator place, where I was.  Trying to describe this was
  going to be a nightmare, but I was stuck on optimizing her time so
  that she would be able to get good time on her own project (me
  writing her speech (shit I'm meeting her again tomorrow (**))) and
  I didn't think of the option of having her meet me at the station.
  It's a known location, and it was a short walk from the apartment
  place. Well, a 3 minute walk.   (I was, at least, smart enough to
  disallow her to meet me at my apartment which would have been
  ridiculous (15 minute walk). yay for that.)</p>

<p>okay, my glasses are dirty I noticed and I'm like, "aight take a
  shower" (that's called an extended remix glasses cleaning, jeez)
  cause I'm like aight I'm supposed to call janette in 23 minutes; I
  can *barely* take a shower in that amount of time = rush rush rush
  rush rush; gotta get away from that.</p>

<p>(*) found one email.  It bounced.</p>

<p>(**) fuck, even though I knew my schedule would be tight, I oh
  dammit and i haven't done my laundry this weekend.  FUCK!</p>

  Urgent graph bedammed; it's time to do laundry.)</p>

<p>This will be brief for now, but it's that time of the month for me.</p>

<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>Masahiko (the guard/helper guy from the bank) is going to
    drive me to Nikko tomorrow!!  It was so random; the last time I
    saw him at the bank, he's like, 'what are your day off December?'
    and I cracked out my calendar and he said, "I pick you up
    Wednesday 3rd December."</p>

<p>"Cool; where will we go?"</p>

<p>"Nikko. I pick you up at 6am, okay?"</p>

<p>"Awesome!"</p>

<p>Just this morning he called to confirm.  It's really going to
  happen!  I wonder what kind of adventure this will be.</p></li>

<li><p>I am pretty much in love with Miki, and janette knows about her
    and his hanging tough knowing that I have fallen in and out of
    love in the past, and I really don't know anything about Miki
    really and it would take a lot more knowing for me before I do
    anything more with Miki.  It's a strange situation, yes.</p></li>

<li><p>This ding dong computer reallllly chows through
battery.</p></li>

<li><p>From 79% to 7% in the amount of time I've written this entry.
    And I don't hunt and peck.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm going to go look for an apartment today.  This is just the
    start of my search, but I am actually going to go out and look.
    I'll stop at the bank and ask Masahiko (when he called me this AM,
    he asked if I would come by and I said yes around 11am) to see if
    he can help me get started.</p></li>

<li><p>(interesting, it's still at 7%; it seems to be highly
miscalibrated)</p></li>


<li><p>I'm considering the possibility of buying food to cook at my
    house because it would be less expensive monetarily (if more
    expensive timeily) and because it seems like a good skill to
    develop again.  Plus during the Nova holidays (27 Dec - 3 Jan) I
    should have time to cook and I don't know what convenience store
    hours will be.  Does *everything* *really* shut down?  I dunno.  I
    doubt it; sounds more like hype, but Japan is quirky.</p></li>

<p>janette wasn't as genki as I thought she'd be and then she told me
  she sent me a comment.  Oh.  I see now.  </p>

<p class=date>4:52pm JST Tuesday 2 December 2003</p>

<p>Fuck a duck this has been the nuttiest day kinda emotionally I
  guess.  I was like GRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGRRRRRRARRRRRRRRRRR! when
  janette was talking like not coming to Japan and I'm like fuck Miki
  I'll never see her again if that's what it takes to get you to Japan
  and I'm like damn what is all this about and then I have to ZOOM off
  to meet Liz who I asked on a moment's notice to come translate for
  me at this apartment locator place and i was coughing and short of
  breath cause I hauled ass there, running a newly-red light before
  the cross traffic could bite me, and zooming over the bridge with
  the traffic and Liz and this cat were yammering a million miles per
  hour and I'm like fuck this living in Japan shit I just want to go
  home; fuck learning anything else, and I was in a pretty pissy mood
  about janette and Miki fiasco into which I've gotten myself and
  spilled it all to Liz who was like, "this is your new chance to
  start your new life in Japan" and I'm like, FUCK THAT I'm not going
  to start a new life; this is my fucking life; I'm in it right now
  and the answer, according to all the movies and books, the answer is
  inside me, but why can't I fucking see it?</p>

<p>And we went to the Prince Hotel and i  helped her with her speech
  and really wrote a good little number for her, including a good
  joke that Japanese English-speaking audience should get and we
  chowed and looked out over the city and I felt better (eating at
  least once a day is a good thing I'm sure)</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Zoom back home and I'm on the edge of late to meet まさひこ at
  5:10pm at 綱島 station cause he was like, "how about you spend the
  night at my house tonight and we'll get an early start in the
  morning" and I'm like, "ummmmmm okay" cause i never say no (fuck
  that, I'm learning to say no, but I chose not to say no to him (I
  miss my fucking I group goddammit)) and I run myself ragged busy
  and I haven't done my laundry today, but now I'm about to go meet
  him and begin some new adventure, but I just wanted to rant and
  write what has happened so far.</p>

<p>Finish.  ありがと。</p>

<p>今、優彦さん　(まさひこ) のいえにいます。</p>

<p>I really like his wife's spoken Japanese; I don't know if she
  speaks more clearly or if I am suddenly understanding more, but it
  seems that I can pick up more of her spoken words than other
  peoples'.</p>

<p>Ummmmm we took the train to his house (over an hour from 綱島) and
  he cooked a rockin' dinner!  janette *totally* would love this; the
  house is full of quirky stuff and not at all like a stuffy clean
  house that I thought most (but what the heck do I know, this is the
  first Japanese home I've been to) Japanese homes might be.  Anyway,
  I totally want janette to come visit Masahiko's house and have him
  cook for her and me; that will rule.</p>

<p>Watched two western movies each starring James Dean, whose voice is
  nothing like I thought it would be (I expected Elvis, and I found it
  squeaky and Texan twangy), East of Eden and Giants (?) I think.</p>

<p>Anyway, mostly my mind has been on what</p>

<p>(( oh, tonight was my first bath in a Japanese home; wash wash
  wash in the shower and then galooosh (gently) into the HOT water
  and soak until my heart was like, "hey jack, this is too hot" and I
  got out.  Nice, but chotto hot for me ))</p>

<p>the hell I'm doing in Japan and what the hell I'm doing in the
  world.  In my mind I have begun to compose a theory that I can never
  settle down with one *anything* be it home, country, relationship,
  job, project, anything.  I'm having tons of fun experiencing new
  experiences tonight with MH and have (jeez we're camping out on
  futons in the guest room while his wife is in the main room (I
  presume) and I'm trying to turn off the light and explain that I can
  type just fine without it and he's like turning it back on insisting
  that it's okay; I hope he falls asleep soon; we're scheduled to be
  awake and ohgodthirty (4:30)) really enjoyed this and part of me has
  wondered if I could settle in this area and ride the とかいど line
  for an hour to work every day, and part of me realizes I could
  settle anywhere, but I don't want to settle anywhere cause I want to
  see everywhere first.</p>

<p>じゅんこ, his daughter called and asked to talked to me and I
  yammered with her a *bit* in Japanese like, "what is your name" (おな
  まえは何ですか。) and something else easy, oh spelling her name in
  Japanese and then she said "あってください。" and it took me a bit
  to understand what she meant, basically a polite "I look forward to
  meeting you," and I'm like, "oh 私も" and it all begins
  again.  <em>Junko, junko, how old is Junko?  Could I stand to have
  Masahiko as my inlaw? I wonder if she's cute?</em> etc and it's like
  holy shit dude, cut it the fuck out, but it's still there; it still
  happens.</p>

<p>でも, I wonder what what what I'll do in the world.  I've
  considered writing to "famous" people who have guided me to ask for
  more guidance, but I know that the guidance really must come from
  within (thank you Kristen (do you still read this?) for banging me
  on the head with that one (will you ever kiss me? (oh shit I should
  probably erase that)) a couple years back) and fuck if I'm not
  quite sure how to get at it (meditation, dingaling)</p>

<p>So my idea is basically that I can never settle, never be
  satisfied, until I find that settled place within myself (yes I know
  it's a process (Jennifer (same b-date 5 years later))) and not black
  and white (Bryn), but there's still got to be some mysterious red
  pill that I'm missing that will show me the truth.  Right?</p>

<p><em>boo-boooo.</em></p>

<p>Yes, the truth is that I don't actually want *anyone*; I want parts
  of everyone; I want my mommy to take care of me; I want to know (be
  told) what to do all the time; I want to do everything myself (in
  the ER, covered in bandages and white astral light, "no problem,
  Dad, I got it under control.") and I want to be <em>the best</em> at
  everything I do.  ("You're not cool; you'll never win, if you're not
  Arian; Aries, Aries, we're the best; we're better than all the rest"
  or something like that [and] "... cause Aries are the best." "Of
  course!")</p>

<p>I want to look back upon my life and be <em>amazed</em> at what
  I've done.  I just want to be like, "wow.  Good job."</p>

<p>Okay; maybe that's all for now.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>nothing else came to mind while I read comics.  Supposed to be
  awake in 2.75 hours.  good night.</p>

<p>I cannot fucking believe how fucking drunk Neil H-Y got tonight.
  He's my fucking boss's boss and he got SMASHED at the going away
  party for Rachel. I mean like, fucking shit if you're going to come
  to a party where ALL of your staff will be, don't get fucking
  drunk.  Just don't do it.  Make an appearance, hey hey great to see
  you have a drink or two, but don't get SMASHED.</p>

<p>He was saying some weird shit to Phong like, "can I just do this?"
  and extending his hand in a weird handshake like motion, but that
  looked kinda like a waltz dance move.  "Can I just do this?" and he
  put his head down sideways like to lay in Phong's lap (didn't
  actually do it, but).  To Morag I was like, "I'm really
  unimpressed."</p>

<p>I didn't think he'd be able to hear me or know I was talking about
him.</p>

<p>"You're un impressed are you?"</p>

<p><em>oh shit, he heard me.</em></p>

<p>"May I, may I," as he got up to come to my side of the table, "May
I just come sit over here?"</p>

<p>"Apparently you can."</p>

<p>"May I sit by you?"</p>

<p>And I'm like, "um no" <em>I really wish you wouldn't</em>, and
  kinda moved over away from where he was sitting.</p>

<p>"May I just do this?" and he took my hand like to shake it and put
  it up near my chest.</p>

<p>he put his arm around me and I pretty much felt really
  uncomfortable because:</p>

<p>1) He's my AAM (boss's boss)
<br>2) He's not making any sense
<br>3) It's almost like he's hitting on me
<br>4) He's my fucking AAM for god's sake!  Why the fuck is he my boss
and I'm just a fucking peon and I don't drink and he's smashed and
babbling incoherently philosophically trying to make me think there's
a shred of logic in what the fuck he was saying?????</p>

<p>I looked away from him; I could hardly face him and think "your my
  boss" and not want to just HATE him and hate that I'm so careful
  not to get like him but where am I and where is he?   So apparently
  drunk people get to be the bosses' boss; well fuck NOVA; I'm outta
  here.  <em>I'd give you my resignation right now if I thought you
  would remember it.</em></p>

<p>He kept saying variants of shit like, "Do you actually think that I would
  think that you thought you would do that?" and "Why do you think
  you would think I would do that?" substituting 'you' for 'I' and
  'I' for 'you' as desired.  Repeatedly.</p>

<p>And I queried my angels for an answer.  "Why am I here?"  That's
  the question I came up with.  <em>I don't know</em> is the only
  answer that appeared.</p>

<p>"I don't know.  I really don't know."</p>

<p>Every time I looked away from him he was like, "no, look at me,
  please don't turn away.  And answer would you really think that I
  would think you would actually do that?"</p>

<p><em>Fuckin' hell get me out of here.</em></p>

<p>Somewhere during this time Morag bailed.  Later she said,
  "I'm <em>really</em> sorry; I just couldn't be there; I couldn't
  help you; I knew there was nothing I could do."</p>

<p>She used my shoulder to help herself stand up, which I knew was a
  "I feel your pain my brother; I wish I could help," kind of
  support.</p>

<p>Then a bit later she walked by and put her hand on my head to say
  the same thing.</p>

<p>"Are you cool?" asked Neil.</p>

<p>"I don't think so."</p>

<p>"Someone has just walked by and put their hand on your head like
  this," and proceeded to put his hand on my head like that, "and I
  wonder why do you think that they thought to do that.  Does that
  make you cool?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"But why would you think that they would think to put their hand on
  your head to make me think that I think you are cool?"</p>

<p>(yes, it doesn't make any sense.  yes it was not cool.)</p>

<p>"I think she was just trying to tell me がんばって。"  I don't
  know if he understood what I meant.</p>

<p>The table next door to us wanted to have their picture taken, and
  Rachel gave her camera to Neil and then the people in front of the
  camera were like, "Rob come get in the picture."  I'm sure they did
  this deliberately to rescue me.  I'm so so so thankful.</p>

<p>Neil was apparently able to take the picture, but after that he was
  literally fumbling around with the camera and nearly dropping it
  (expensive digital camera while the lens was out and everything) and
  I reached up to take it from him and then he was leaning stuporedly
  against the wall and then stumbled out of the area to go pee I'm
  guessing.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Carla reported, "For anyone who was wondering,
  Cory is helping Neil who went into the womens' restroom."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>As Morag and I were leaving (to catch the last train home) Neil
  was slumped (standing) against the wall near the elevator.  "Please
  don't go, I'm scared," but Cory had just been there and I had heard
  him (Cory) say, "we can't leave him like that" or something so I
  knew that I could completely release responsibility.</p>

<p>I had no problem saying, "We have to go, we're catching the last
  fucking train right now."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>As we waited in Hiyoshi station, a Japanese guy hurled repeatedly
  down onto the track from the platform.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<br>And that is why I don't drink.</p>

<p>This morning (and for the past couple of mornings,) my neck is
  really tight/sore/ouchy, so I'm choosing not to take my computer to
  work.  I haven't typed anything while at work recently; usually it's
  just on the trains that I type, and today (Saturday (my Wednesday))
  is quite unlikely that I'll get a seat on the train.  Wait, maybe it
  is likely; I forget. Anyway, fuckit; I'm not bringing my computer.
  I'll study flashcards that Ayana made for me yesterday.</p>

<p>Okay, see you later, computer.</p>

<p>oops.  okay; I've read online for longer than I wanted.  Now I'm
  going to study.</p>

<p>Today was Rachel's last day at Nova.  She had a cute voice.  I'll
  miss it.</p>

<p>I got a postcard from janette today! I've actually received three
  so far from her most recent trip to Boston with Josephine.</p>

<p>Had two &gt;M&lt; lessons with what's-her-name (たかこ?), my Aries
  buddy at KQ.  She's 7B, and seemed to grasp well is/has and some
  descriptive adjectives and present progressive verbs.  Nice.  I
  hope to watch her progress; it's students like her that make me
  interested in staying around.  Not like to hook up with her, but
  like legitimately to just be excited for her progress.</p>

<p class=dream>I was in my apartment here in Japan (and Fred was over)
  and Elizabeth Anderson (YRUU, Austin) came over specifically to say
  goodbye; she was leaving.  I invited her in, chatted with her a bit,
  Fred gave her a big hug, and then she left.</p>
