                        <p class=date>7:55am JST Thursday 10 April 2003</p>

<p>Good morning.  The briefest sentence describing the party:</p>

<p>Wow, she was loud.</p>

<p>About 12 hours ago Dru and I arrived at Ben's apartment for a
pre-party yammering session about whatever came up.  What came up: the
war and their travel stories.  I found out that there's a lot about
the world that I don't know.  Completely left out of their
conversation only because I had nothin to input.  They know shit about
Nigeria, Laos, Thailand, Viet Nam, South America.. it's like all of
their travel stories <em>crush</em> all my travel stories.  Is that
possible?  Doesn't my 11,000 mile driving trip hold some merit or some
interest to their however-many mile backpacking trips?</p>

<p>Backpacking.  Like it's the only real form of travel - to pave the
way for the hordes, thereby destroying the area for future backpackers
or even the original backpackers.  They were saying shit like how
Thailand *used* to be cool to visit but now it's been overrun by
visitors.  For a real adventure go backpacking in Laos.  Dru argued
that Thailand is the perfect place to learn backpacking: it's a
different culture and one has all the amenities one needs.  Then once
one is more comfortable, head on North and slip across the border into
Laos where the territory is less frequented, so far untainted by the
hordes.</p>

<p>There's a whole new culture out there - a subculture that thrives
on exploring new cultures.  One with adventure in its blood and
something else eloquent describing the free spirit.</p>

<p>Ben said his friend (who seems to look like my friend Kristen)
lives in Egypt and the locals *love* her and call her the queen.  Or
the princess or something.  He suggests that the media we see...</p>

<p class=message>wow you know this is a really beautiful part of outer
Tokyo.  We're on a train from Takao to Tachikawa (I hope I hope) and
going through a tunnel now because we were just through some tree
coated valley with slender pines arching toward Heaven, twinkling
gently in the sun.</p>

<p>...that the media we see shows us fabricted foreign-government
organized rallies spewing hatred toward the US...  that actually most
of the locals have no idea who the enemy is..  and </p>

<p class=message>(hold please) How is this possible?  Oh so clearly
the physical sign I saw next to the train indicated Shinjuku and Tokyo
as stops for the train I boarded.  However, we went through beautiful
mountains cause we were headed *out* of Tokyo.  Sigh.</p>

<p class=message>I've dismounted the train at Sagamiko.  Trains are
not as common here as they are closer to Tokyo.  And I'm down to 23%
battery on my computer; I didn't plug it in last night.</p>

<p>basically he was saying it's okay to roll over to Egypt and if one
is female with blondeish reddish hair and fair complexion they might
call one queen.</p>

<p class=message>I took a train back toward Takao and *everyone* got
off and tons of people got on.  I asked and the woman said it would
not go the direction I wanted to go, that I should use the other
platform.  Seems that this was the end/beginning of the line, which
explains why I had a seat, but doesn't explain the signage.  I'm
thankful that I asked.  I seem to be on a train that's going the right
direction now.</p>

<p>So.  Um, so they talked about travel and the war and I was left out
out out of the conversation with nothing apparent to add.  Though I
did get one maybe two intelligent comments in.  Aright.</p>

<p>Then people started arriving.  I kept up with names for the first 8
people or so.</p>

<p class=message>7% battery power remains.  TTFN.</p>

<p class=date>11:51am</p>

<p class=message>Okay; I'm dressed for work and waiting for my train.
Good thing that on the way to work I transfer and end at big stations
that all the different trains visit if they stop at my
station. &lt;crossing fingers></p>

<p>So..  the party.  Oh, so anyway fuck the detailed version; a ton of
people came and one girl was sooooo loud!  Like..  like...  I was
embarassed to be there, knowing this party was WAY too loud to have in
an apartment in Japan.  Japanese cats are pretty loathe to complain,
but we got a complaint.  If we had been in the US, certainly we would
have had cops over unless it was Friday on a college campus for
partiers.  I mean the shit was LOUD.  Caterwalling screeching as bad
as that movie where Cameron Diaz' character was made to karaoke and
she was terrible, but just kept at it.  Well this girl kept at it and
kept on keeping at it to the point that like <em>everyone</em> was all
oh my god shut her up!  But trying to see the humor in it, but it
wasn't funny at all.</p>

<p>I kept thinking how unimpressed I was with this party.  I was
loathe to say anything because I was the new guy in this group, etc,
.. but I did say something to her, but it didn't help.  at all.</p>

<p>She reminded me of that episode of the Simpsons where Barney is
video recorded dressed in Marge's clothes and drinking beer off the
floor...  Does Annie know what an obnoxious caterwalling maniac she's
being?  Standing on a chair, screeching into a Jack Daniel's
bottle-mic..  Eeeeee.</p>

<p>I did have fun talking to Drew, Penni (from Melbourne?), and
Jennifer (from Duncanville (Dallas)).</p>

<p>The trains stop running at midnight and I was still pretty much
having fun so I committed myself to staying overnight.  By 2 or 3am
though I was sleepin' in Ben's room on his futon.  Andrew slept on a
sleepin' bag.  Super duper special thanks to Ben for allowing us a
place to crash out.</p>

<p>The party was still rockin', but I slept using my super hero power
of being able to sleep anywhere.  Andrew's super hero power is even
better; he was sawing logs before I was.</p>

<p>About an hour (?) later, Annie (our caterwalling singer) came in
all, "what are you doing?"</p>

<p>"Sleeping; you should try it sometime."</p>

<p>Woke up in the morning around 8am to head home (getting lost on the
way), eat, shower, change, go to work.</p>

<p>Being silly has its benefits and some apparent drawbacks.</p>

<p>I have just arrived at the International Lounge where I can get
inexpensive Japanese classes (100 yen for 2 hours = ridiculously
cheap) and classes have just ended for the day and won't happen again
until <em>Thursday</em>.</p>

<p>Now.  I <em>had</em> this information; it was given to me and
Olivia at the Ward Office on the same day.  The day we signed up for
our alien registration.</p>

<p><em>Olivia</em> (and some girl-friend of hers (who sounded like a
Kiwi)) came to the class.  I missed it.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>However, it does appear that I'm doing this "Japan thing" on my own
more than she.  That's apparently a choice; I could hang out with my
roommates more, but they don't seem interested in taking Japanese
classes.  I could meet other cats, but I've not done that so far.
I've found my little internet cafe and have plugged in for my fix.
But the fix is no longer free, and I hear Japan calling me while I'm
there.</p>

<p>Olivia had a friend with her who's fluent in Japanese and English
at the Ward office.  I imagine this bridge to the Japanese world has
made it a bit easier for her to become integrated and feel settled
enough to .. for example, pay attention to the flyer and plan ahead
and come to class instead of play online.</p>

<p>The d'ohest part of this: I have Tuesdays and Wednesdays off.  I
just missed the one class that's held during my two days off.
But.... I can come on Thursday & Friday and then zip off to work when
I'm done.</p>

<p>After studying a bit, and sleeping a bit more, I trained to
Shinjuku to meet up with Dru.  We walked randomly around the city,
people watching and into an electronics store where we scoped out some
crazy small cameras and minidisc players and video cameras..
<em>Small</em> small small is the keyword there.  Looked at some of
the electronic translators, but didn't get any; the model I wanted was
more expensive than Travis suggested I could find it.  So instead I
bought a shower scrubby thing for exfoliation purposes.  Oh we visited
a pachinko parlor and he told me that gambling is illegal in Japan,
but the balls that people accumulate can be exchanged for prizes.  And
there's a store nearby that will purchase the prizes.  Wow.  The room
was ridiculously loud.  Din so incredible that the woman behind the
desk wore a headset and mic, amplifying her voice so she could be
heard.</p>

<p>We finally settled upon a sushi train where we basically dared each
other to try different slimey things to eat.  Clam, squid, scoops of
little fish, slimey white slime stuff, slimey pink stuff, and crab
salad.  Oh, and he told me the word for green tea.  Something like
ochya so I turned toward the waitress to ask and he starts snickering
as if it's the wrong word.  I turned back to him and he's all, "naw,
I'm just kidding; it really is ochya" so I ask her and the waitress
points to cups right in front of me with tea bags beside them.
D'oh!</p>

<p>Funny how we get into patterns; on the way to Dru's house, he led
us to the station for his work.  D'oh!  130 yen each to fix that
little error, but whatever.</p>

<p>Kickin' it in his apartment now watching Simpsons; his roommate
Chris just got home from work.  He's from Melbourne.  "Melbourne shits
all over Sydney."  "Everyone thinks 'Sydney is Australia' and it's
not; it's just Sydney."</p>

<p>A bit cramped on the train, trying to respect the personal space of
those around me.  But we basically all have seats on this train.  I
can see a hint of my getting better at navigating the train system in
that I've memorized a rail line and a station that goes with it: the
Nambu line goes through Musashi-kosugi.  I've not memorized the kanji
that goes with these names, but it's a start.</p>

<p>According to the chart, I've got 29 minutes on this train til we
reach Musashi-kosugi.  Should be early enough for me to transfer to my
line, Toyuko-Tokaido (or something like that) and zip down three
stations to Tsunashima.  Oh, and I've learned a trick:  when in a
random station going to a random station, just purchase the cheapest
ticket available, then use the Fare Adjustment machine at the end
station to pay the remainder.  That way I don't have to figure out the
exact fare, and I won't pay too much.</p>

<p>In *this* case, going home tonight, I'm using a loophole (?) in the
system.  I've got a pass that says I can go from Musashi-kosugi to
Tsunashima.  I bought that at the end of March (and Nova will
reimburse me for it on my first paycheck: May 15th) for like 11000
yen.  That much?  Shit that's $100.  Anyway, I got the pass and I was
able to get into the system with the smallest ticket available 130 yen
and will get out of the rail system using my pass.  Wow I'm really
abusing the system with my $100 rail pass.</p>

<p class=date>11:55pm</p>

<p>Musashi-kosugi station now and I must say "Hey man, why is no one
else getting on this train?"  From what I can tell it's a local train
(stops at every station) so maybe they want to wait for the express
which leaves in 5 minutes.  Whatever.  I'm 90% sure I'm on a train
that will work for me.</p>

<p class=date>12:00am</p>

<p>Dagnabbit.  Everyone was asked to get off the train, and I'm two
stops from home.  Some people split and left the station.  Enough
people are still here that I imagine I can get on the next train with
them.  Good deal.  Mental fingers are crossed.</p>

<p class=date>12:02am</p>

<p>A train just zipped past; I wonder if it's carrying those who
stayed at Musashi-Kosugi.</p>

<p class=date>12:10am</p>

<p>Made it to Tsunashima.  I'm too tired right now to really
appreciate this as a wild and fun adventure.  I'm simply thankful that
I'm home and won't have to walk a long way nor pay a lot for a cab.
Thank you train system that I gypped with my $100 pass.  Thank
you.</p>

<p>Going to walk home now without stopping by the internet cafe.  380
yen minimum is out of my price range for now.</p>

<p>Work has gone quite well today.  I've had three lessons so far and
am now on lunch.  My third lesson was a 7C with two students.  7C is
the lowest level and could mean they know no English at all.  At the
beginning of the lesson I was a tad worried, but by the end, I had
them simulating a customer purchasing something from a store clerk,
and the store clerk making change for the price.</p>

<p>And I'm talking *basic* stuff.</p>

<p>I would say, "okay, bananas and apples."</p>

<p>A: "Bananas and apples please."</p>

<p>B: mime giving the item</p>

<p>A: "How much?"</p>

<p>B: "one dollar"</p>

<p>A: give the play money</p>

<p>B: give play money change</p>

<p>I wonder how much of this shit they retain.</p>

<p>This</p>

<p>Gah.</p>

<p>Where am I?  Who am I?  What the hell am I doing here holed up in
my room?  Do I want to learn Japanese?  Do I want to be famous?  How
can I become famous by sitting scared in my room?  Do I want to write
a novel?  How can I write a novel when I'm not writing?  How can I
expect to get letters if I'm not writing them?  I've written two since
I've been here and have received four.  I think four.</p>

<p>I *am* famous!  I've gotten four letters and tons of emails but..
I don't *feel* famous..  how will I know if I'm really famous?  What
the fuck is famous?  Why am I still not studying Japanese?  Why am I
afraid to go play a bit in the fucking pachinko parlor when I've got
probably 100,000 yen in my wallet?  Why do I know how much money is in
my wallet?  Why don't I know how much money is in my wallet?  Why
haven't I paid back my loans?  Why do I get stuck online?  What am I
doing here in Japan?  I can just fucking work at home if I'm not
going to learn Japanese?  Shit I can learn fucking Japanese at home!
Rie was teaching me and I had another class to attend but I didn't
study cause just cause and now that I'm in Japan I'm not
<em>immersed</em>.  Trust me I'm not fucking immersed; I've got 2
English speaking roommates and 100% of my co-workers by definition
speak English.</p>

<p>And my roommates are both gone doing whatever my roommates do when
they're gone and I'm just sitting scared here in my room cause I don't
know what's out there for me to do.  I've got my little sushi dinner
from the corner store.  I don't have to understand Japanese to get it;
I just look at the numbers on the cash register while they yammer in
Japanese the price.  Only thing vaguely interesting about that is
memorizing a few different coins and their values.  Trivial.</p>

<p>Where is the fucking challenge?  Maybe I should go memorize my
train stations so I won't have to write any more idiotic messages
about how I got lost again cause I can't figure out which train is
which.  How dumb is that?</p>

<p>I should do something really challenging like go to some fucking
African country that hasn't been tainted by western values and
capitalism and all that.  A culture that's really different - not just
a different language.</p>

<p>Sigh.</p>

<p class=date>9:07pm</p>

<p>I'm a bit better now.  I just wrote a postcard to Eminem and am
going to work on my mass email list.</p>

<p>I still don't have the trains perfectly figured out.  Today I got
on a limited express without realizing it until we passed my stop by
two stations.</p>

<p>Oh jeez</p>

<p>It all started by missing my first stop (out of dumbness for having
not more carefully memorizing the name of my transfer station) for I
was certain that my stop was farther past a certain notable landmark
(rail yard of many tracks) <em>and</em> that we got off at my station
on the left, not the right.</p>

<p>Went one more station, got off, turned around, got on, went one
station, and the announcer voice in Japanese yammered something in
Japanese and then said in English, "this train is bound for
musashi-kosugi; the next station is shin-busagu" or some shit like
that and I'm like cool musashi-kosugi.  Got off and it looked a bit
different cause I was coming from the other direction, went down the
stairs, through the turnstiles with my ticket and hear the <em>BING
BONG</em> that shouts to everyone "HEY EVERYBODY LOOK!! THIS GUY IS
TRYING TO GET THROUGH THE TURNSTILES WITH A BOGUS TICKET!!!!"</p>

<p>Now if this happens when I know I'm at the correct station and
there's millions of people busting through the turnstiles all at once
and bing-bongs happening every 20 seconds, then no one can track it.
But, there was one person going through the turnstiles, including
me.</p>

<p>And I was in the wrong station.</p>

<p>Fuck!  How did that happen?</p>

<p>To the gate guard all, "musashi-kosugi" and he's all,
"yammeryammeryammer no musashi-kosugi [for you]"</p>

<p>I'm all, "Kawasaki" and pointing to my rail pass, cause Kawasaki is
where I need to go ultimately.</p>

<p>He's all "yammeryammeryammeryammer" and then "yammeryammeryammer
yammeryammer" and pointing all over the place outside the station
toward McDonald's and inside the station at the turnstiles and I'm
like <em>fuck!</em> cause I have no idea what he was saying</p>

<p>but I went over to where he seemed to be pointing most often, but
that was outside and I'm like hollering quietly
goddammitfuckinshitmotherfuckerbitchshit and a woman who had seen my
plight guided me through and I was all, "arigato arigato arigato" to
her a ton.</p>

<p>I recognized I had originally been on an express train, which
skipped the station that the local train visited while going the other
direction.  The woman actually went on the train with me that one
extra station and once I knew where I was I tried to shake her off me
(verbally) so she could do whatever she does in her real life.
Finally I was putting up my hand like stop toward her and she got it.
More "arigatos" and I was on my way.</p>

Pointer, dont eat the deserts&hellip;trust me on this one, they taste as weird as they look. Hope your having a good time over all&hellip;you gotta get on AIM some time and open a ROB chat room so everyone can talk to you. Mmm, that could get really intersting come to think of it. Hehe!<br>
