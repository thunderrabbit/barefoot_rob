<p>Now I've gotten my finances up to date.  Have paid off the balance
on fixing Scott just before I left for SWUUSI way back in July.  Have
paid my credit card off (mostly gas purchases, but also for my website
hosting for the next 13 months) and all is lovely.</p>

<p>Going to put new spark plugs on Scott now.</p>

<p>I got these new crazy spark plugs with <a href="https://www.boschautoparts.com/en/auto/spark-plugs/platinum-4-spark-plugs"> four (4) electrode
things to spark.</a>  Wow.</p>

<p>I found a fresh exciting new way to shred documents that I don't
want anyone else to read.  In this case, the documents were Wende's
bank account information that was sent to me at my dad's house since
I'm still on the account.</p>

<p>I know that Wende would appreciate the account information be
destroyed.  I don't have a shredder here, but I found that putting the
paper into a sink full of hot(!) soapy water, then swishing them
around with a scrub brush does a pretty good job of rendering them
illegible.</p>

<p>How can I do this?</p>

<p>I am going through lots of T-shirts, allocating some to be sewn
into a quilt.  Mostly rally shirts, and I just came across a KTRU
shirt, NIN, The Flaming Idiots...  All the shirts that I <em>like</em>
are the ones I both want to wear *and* archive into a quilt.  Can't do
both.</p>

<p>How can I predict which ones I will want to wear later?</p>

<p>This seems like the same questions as a long haired person would go
through before cutting his/her hair really short.  When should I do
it?  What if I wish I hadn't?  What if blah blah blah??</p>

<p>Sigh.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Next shirt I look at is an ultimate shirt.  Then my Year Of The
Rabbit shirt.  Fuck!!</p>

<p>Will I even be able to wear these in Japan on a regular basis?
Will I have enough space to keep half of them?  Argh.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Here are the single size Tonka Toys sheets I've used at SWUUSI the
past two years.  Should I keep them?  If I am able to go back to
SWUUSI, I will want to use them next year.  Will I be allowed to
attend?  What about the year after that?</p>

<p>Why am I trying to hold on to material possessions that I know will
age and deteriorate and eventually fall to pieces?</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>It's a combination platter of not know what I will experience in
the next few months before I go to Japan, not having any idea what
stuff will be like once I'm there, wanting to be well prepared for any
contingency, having no idea what stuff will help me be prepared.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I think I'll mentally check out by reading a chapter of
<em>Stranger In A Strange Land</em>.</p>

<p class=date>7:30pm</p>

<p>Make that four chapters.</p>

<p class=date>7:56pm</p>

<p>As I left the room in disgust at the seemingly overwhelming amount
of work to be done, my mind touched on the simple solution: "just pack
what I need and go on my trip."</p>

<p>This touches the realm of the Infinite, and has been confirmed with
my experience of rallies, and further confirmed in a conversation I
had some years ago with Cathy Saur, ex-YRUU and now married.</p>

<p>The conversation may have taken place when I drove her to Fort
Worth Rally 1997.  Just me and her for 5 hours in the car.  We talked
about the nature of love and hate all the way there.  Rallies are so
awesome because you don't have to bring anything to the rally.
Anything you need you can just borrow.</p>

<p>I don't know what the average bear would think about this.  But it
solves my problem of sorting stuff, and helped me snap back to the
present instead of hanging onto the past and worrying about the
future.</p>

<p>I'll just pack the stuff I need and not take the rest.</p>

<p>Recently (whatever that means), I discern something about how I
live my life.  Something like when I don't take care of myself, I end
up feeling anxious and unable to decide what to do next, like the OS
that spends more time trying to optimize its actions than doing what
it needs to do.</p>

<p>My life has been thrown off balance due to working many hours at
work.  My paycheck indicates I worked like 90+ hours in the last two
weeks, which to me is a lot, considering at FSD I worked like 35 hours
a week and walked 5 minutes to get there, whereas lately I've had to
drive 30 minutes to Prestonwood blah blah blah whatever.  fuck trying
to defend if I have actually been working a lot.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I <em>did</em> get Oksana's email address.  She's the cute Russian
girl at work, and it turns out she has a seven year old son.  That
scratches her right off my list, but she's still cute.  I'll write to
her soonishly maybe.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>At work today I was mostly up in the catwalk on the curved white
truss, re-tying some ropes to raise a piece of fabric by 1 foot.
Vince helped me.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Another part of my feeling discombobulated is that I haven't yet
received my clear plastic folder that had all my current papers and
shit in it, which I left at Barbie's.  She said she sent it to me
here, but it doesn't seem to have arrived yet.  Pooh.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>ANYWAY, I have noticed I feel out of wack, and it's due to me
working so many hours (gone 11 hours per day), and I'm glad to finally
be done with that.</p>

<p>I have the weekend off to get all my shiznit together and do stuff
for myself.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Sean came in for about an hour; he's going to an ultimate
tournament in Denton.  Sean needed a ride.  In a lovely coincidence,
Hart and two other of Sean's friends are going to Denton (actually
Lewisville) for a party and will be glad to drop him off after the
party.  Rock.</p>

<p>Oh my god what is wrong with the fucking society where we have bags
and bags and bags of <em>leaves</em> to be thrown away to keep the
lawn ..  what clean?  Green?</p>

<p>Throwing away all that perfectly designed perfect fertilizer
designed by none other than five hundred million years of perfection
by Nature... Blaoouughh!!!!</p>

<p>deezi = dawg
<br>fo Sheezi = true
<br>geezi = girlfriend

<p>Today at Prestonwood, I was mostly up in the catwalks, crawling
around tying ropes and tightening other ropes, rearranging large
sections of fabric, and generally having a good time.</p>

<p>Funny thing is that I went home with the elevator key.  I wonder if
I could make a copy of it very easily.</p>

<p>We had to leave Prestonwood around 1:30 cause there was a funeral
scheduled for 3pm.</p>

<p>At Wolf Shop, I mostly helped Justin glue spangles onto big sheets
of fabric.</p>

<p>I also got to help Oksana, the cute Russian girl.  She asked if I
would help her with something and I thought <em>how do you say</em>
"I'll do anything for you" <em>in Russian?</em></p>

<p>I'm so silly.</p>

<p>Johnny is a pretty cool cat.  He's the owner of Wolf Company.</p>

<p>Today I was up on the catwalks and the trusses a lot.  Had some
frustration trying to get the slack removed from a rope; basically I
couldn't loosen the screw holding the right end of the rope, but I
could loosen the screw holding the wrong end of the rope.  In the
interim I tried loosening the center of the rope, which was way on the
other side of the truss, requiring me to crawl through a nice crawlway
around the back perimeter of the stage.</p>

<p>Kinda hard on the knees unless I uses yoga techniques I learned
from Catherine.</p>
