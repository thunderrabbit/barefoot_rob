<p><p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>in this dream I lived on Methil drive at the inside a corner:</p>

<pre>            
                   * = my apartment
          * |      - = Methil
------------|      | = a different street
</pre>

<p><p class=dream>each week I would walk down to Matt&rsquo;s house to spend
the night.  This time when I went down, it was like 1am by the time I
got there; too late to knock on their door.  So I headed back. I found
a hot red pepper on the driveway again this week and started eating it
on the way home.  On the way home, there was a large garbage can being
used to boil some hot peppers and corn on the cob.</p>

<p><p class=dream>the guys beside th trash can had a pepper tied to each ear of corn and were going to eat it.  i offered them each a bite
of my pepper, but they refused, saying it would be too hot.  i asked
for a piece of theirs then, but there was some type of anger when
the one guy gave me a piece.  i was all, &ldquo;do you want it back?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s yours now.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>so i left and ate it, kinda watching over my
back, fearing they would throw a knife at me.</p>

<p><p class=dream>then a car drove by and turned in front of me, i was
scared at first, but he was stopping to talk to his friend in a
different car with a lovely female in the back seat being driven
somehwere. it was 4am by this time and she was dressed exceptionally,
down to nice high heel shoes and dress.  i wondered why she was
dressed this well so early in the morning.  the other guy got in the
car beside her, and left his truck on the street.</p>

<p><p class=dream>i recognized that somewhere in the world it was evening
or midday, maybe she was going to an event somewhere else in the
world.  the president does that, i reasoned.  why not she.</p>

<p><p class=dream>as i was walking the rest of teh <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of a blcok to get
back to my apt, my hips started to hurt so badly that I could hardly
walk because they hurt so much.  i stopped walking and noticed a woman
and kid across the street walking and i felt embarassed in front of
them for having gotten so old that my hips were hurting.</p>

<p><p class=dream>i rested there for a moment. and woke up wondering
about something.</p>

<p><p>I think this is the third time I&rsquo;ve mentioned the reunion, and ironically all three entries are stored here in my Handspring Visor.</p>

<p>So we are here at the family reunion.  arrived
about 30 minutes ago into a chorus of hellos and
greetings.  Wende is describing how I missed the turn
coming into the street and everyone yelled from the
deck "WENDE!!!!" watching us.  I was embarassed at
first but soon got over it.  Met everyone, learned two
names.  maybe three.  I get the feeling that people
stayed up to greet us and make sure we got food.  now
everyone is going to bed.  Wende and I will be joining
her sister Stacy and husband Roddrick at a different
cabin tonight.  I hadn't met Rodd before; he's cool.

<p class=date>22:53 28 July 2000</p>

<p>Now we're at the cabin where we'll sleep.  Two
bedrooms, one kitchen, and one loft.  Rodd is sleepin
in the loft where it's warm.  Tomorrow night me and
Wende are sleeping up in the loft.  Especially if
Wende is cold tonight.   

<p>Rodd is tellin' lies about how Rodd and Stacy never
slept together in college.  Actually she apparently
stood up in the bed one time.. while she was asleep.  
Stacey, you need to lay your ass back down and go to
sleep.

<p class=date>23:36 28 July 2000</p>

<p><p>just talk talk talked with Stacy and Rodd.  We&rsquo;re
going to sleep in the loft tonight and maybe tomorrow
night.  Rodd and Stacy told spouse stories on each
other, while Wende and I offered a few thoughts or
insights or laughter as warranted.</p>

<p><p>Once we all split for bed, I came down the loft
ladder face first just to see what it would be like.
I essentially got stuck for a minute laughing holding
myself up with my arms at the bottom and toes at the
top.  Wende took a picture on someone&rsquo;s camera.  So
funny!  Mostly funny because we are tired I&rsquo;m sure.
Now it&rsquo;s potty time and then bed time.</p>

<p>Loren just called.  Northpoint has no record of DSL service at my house under FSD.  They're going to look under my name and by address and she'll call back.  Absolutely amazing.

<p class=date>1:04 Friday 28 July 2000</p>

<p>Floors are swept.  Well, the second and third floors were swept down to the first floor, resulting in a cat furball the size of a cat.

<p>No contact from Savvis yet.

<p class=date>1:23 Friday 28 July 2000</p>

<p><p>Northpoint can&rsquo;t find my DSL circuit in their records.  Loren is going to go to their hardcopy files and find the original order number with Northpoint.  She offered to start again in the morning, but the grand irony is that I&rsquo;ll be at work and they&rsquo;ll want me to unplug the router and shit and let them test while it&rsquo;s unplugged to see if it&rsquo;s the router or the line or whatever.  Bluh.  Unfuckinbelievable.</p>

<p><p>But, on the other hand, good night; I&rsquo;m going to bed.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ve been mostly  working on El Project today, and am pretty close to finished with the coding part (I think!)  Of course I mean done with the coding according to the original specifications as I understand them.</p>

<p><p>I spent most of my time surgically replacing a large question screen, (or actually 3 screens with 150 questions).. replaced those with a small screen of like 71 questions which is much simpler in other aspects too.  The three screens allowed for different sorting of the questions (or sorted the questions differently acccording to who was being rated) and allowed managers to answer more questions than other people. and all kinds of essentially complex stuff that El project doesn&rsquo;t neeed to do.</p>

<p><p>I had to chop down the database to only expect 71 questions instead of 150 and other changes to the way it did stuff.</p>

<p><p>On the non technical front, Erika wrote me a story, which I will add to my site shortly, probably.  I may open up my &ldquo;writings&rdquo; section of the site and add a random stories section.</p>

<ol>
<p><li>I just called SAVVIS, our ISP at work, and also ISP for me an'
Wen's DSL service at home.  They called me during the day today,
saying that the router was un-pingable today.  I booted the router
(power off, power on) and still no connection.  Savvis is contacting
Northpoint now, the DSL carrier and will hopefully call me back soon
so they can try and fix it from there.

<p><li>I got home from work with an astonishing headache.  I took 200mg of
advil and went to sleep for a couple of hourse.  I woke up from a
dream and remember the last part of it:

<p class=dream>I arrived back at home and on my computer found a note
from Will.  Note was something like:

<pre>You weren't home so I installed
this cool game on your computer.
Click here to join our group
Click here to start your own group
Click here to uninstall program
</pre>

<p class=dream>The game was something like Frogger or one of the
old-school video games, but it was played over the network and people
could hook up resources and play as a team.

<p>I woke up after reading the note and wondering how he got into the
house.  (Had I remained dreaming, I would have clicked there to join
their group and played the game)

<p><li>Wende comes home tomorrow!!  This weekend we are going to her
family reunion, and her parental units are coming over on Saturday
evening or Sunday.  Wende asked me to clean up a few things around the
house - scrub bathtub and shower and wash the bathroom rug, sweep the
floors and clean kitchen counter. (sometimes it helps me to have a
list of items, even though these are all stuff that should be done
ongoingly) 

<p>I called her to get specs on what time her parents are coming over
tomorrow.

<p>"They're not coming over tomorrow, but you and I are leaving
tomorrow for the reunion.  They'll come over on Saturday or Sunday."

<p>"Oh yeah!"  Wende has told me that before, probably more than
once.  Then it struck me- "<em>You'll be home tomorrow??</em>"

<p>"Yeah baby."  She said it not like Austin Powers "Yaah Baybee!" but
more like a cross between, "I'm looking forward to it too," and "don't
you know what's going on around you?  I'm coming home tomorrow."

<p>"What time?"

<p>Around 6pm I think she said, but my brain was swimming in happiness
that she'll be home at all so I didn't totally hear her.

<p><li>This morning I got the trickiest part of my java applet to
essentially work, but for some reason it's not quite perfect yet.
I'll mess with it tomorrow.
</ol>

<p class=date>11:01pm</p>

<p><p>Savvis has not called me back yet (that means Jonathan is still on
hold with Northpoint); I shoulda called them earlier because I&rsquo;m going
to bed, and I might be sleepin&rsquo; when they call back.</p>

Subject:Fact or fiction: Dolphin safe tuna.</p>

<p>Not too long ago and not too far away a strapping young man by the name of
Bubba and his armadillo, whom he affectionately called Sue Z Q, set sail for
a three hour tour of the Gulf of Mexico. They had loaded up his Ford F350
pickup truck early that morning with some tuna fish sandwiches and some Lone
Star longnecks.  With a &ldquo;yeehaw&rdquo; they took off down I45 listening to Jerry
Jeff and Robert Earl. Sue Z Q, sweet &lsquo;dilla that she is, lay next to Bubba
the whole way to the Galveston.  As soon as he turned onto the SeaWall and
rolled the windows down though, she jumped up and stuck her snout in the
breeze.  &ldquo;Smell that ocean air!&rdquo; Bubba yelled over the roar of the truck and
the wind.  When they got where they were going, Sue Z stood by as Bubba
rolled the boat into the water.  He unhooked the trailer hitch, replaced his
John Deer cap with a white captain&rsquo;s hat, grabbed Sue Z Q and the two were
off! About an hour and a half into the 3 hour tour and about 14 Lone Stars
into the case, the two were sailing beautifully.  The sun was beating down
and the wind was in there faces, but this didn&rsquo;t faze them at all. After
finishing a couple tuna fish sandwiches Bubba decided this was his chance to
get rid of his farmer&rsquo;s tan, so he pulled off his &ldquo;wife beater&rdquo; and lay back
in the sun.  Sue Z was next to him, wearing her &lsquo;Dilla shades that Bubba had
specially made for her.  She was smiling that big armadillo smile, laying on
her back, front paws behind her head, one leg crossed over the other.  Then
the wind picked up and lifted the straw from Sue Z&rsquo;s long neck and plopped
it down on the deck about five feet away.  She could not have this, so, not
wanting to wake her dear Bubba, she scampered down the deck to go get her
straw.  Well, the water on the deck did not mix well with the residual Extra
Dark Tropic Tan oil that Miss Q had left on her paws.  Before she knew it,
the poor thing had slipped and slid all the way off the deck into the
Armadillo Predator infested water!  The splash woke Bubba, and he groggley
turned to ask Sue Z Q, what the heck that was.  To his surprise she was not
there!  He saw the missing straw and the skid marks on the deck and after
about 12 minutes he put together what had happend (he&rsquo;s not too bright).  He
ran to the starboard side, he ran to the port side, to the bow and to the
stern, searching the water for his dear Miss Sue Z Q.  She was no where to
be found.  The water was calm all around him.  He cried out, his fists in
the air, &ldquo;NOOOO!!!  NOT MY SUE Z!!!&rdquo;  Just as he had crumbled onto the deck
in tears, he heard another splash.  He jumped up to see what it was, and
there he saw the most beautiful sight&hellip;A dolphin was swimming straight
towards the boat, Sue Z Q on his back!!  He reached over, grabbed Sue Z and
held her for quite some time.  Then he turned to thank the dolphin, but he
was gone.  Gone.  No sign at all.  Bubba decided to cut the three hour tour
short and head back to dry land.  He held Sue Z Q in his lap in a towel all
the way to shore.  On the beach that night the two sat around a camp fire
eating s&rsquo;mores and Sue Z Q told Bubba all about her adventure with the
dolphin.  Occasionally if they were very quite and held their breath, they
thought they could hear the dolphins singing in the distance.  From then on,
the two only ate dolphin safe tuna, and so should you.</p>

<p><p>Been working on the java project for Dude. I thought I had it essentially figured out:   the applet opens, reads an input file, displays some mages with hyperlinks, done.</p>

<p><p>However, I initially neglected to realize that the applet cannot just open a file, because the applet is running on the user&rsquo;s machine, while the file is stored on the web server.</p>

<p><p>This means that the applet has to open a connection to the web server, which it is allowed to do, and read the file, which it is allowed to do, but I couldn&rsquo;t find any examples of this.  Found something close, and when I&rsquo;m a bit less brain fried, I think I can figure out how to implement it.    Now I&rsquo;m leaving work to go play ultimate!!</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>we were the poke' mons. (ack).  I was Shadowe.  Other names were hollered like "blodle" and "chilsed" or "aglonse"

<p class=dream>shouted names as we  moved from otside parking lot into 1 story strip center bulding room.  big empty room and we all went in and it was my job to write the rules on the door on the inside of the glass door in dry erase marker.  rule like Do Not look at the answeres before the quest is finished.

<p class=dream>as I was writing, the door was all moving (being a door on hinges and all) so David J helped hold it steady  (from LRY)  and then Adam L (OKC) wanted to write the next rule he said, so I gave him the marker and the surface on which he wrote was no longer the door, but the floppy  fabric of his unbuttoned button-down shirt, which he was wearing.  he signed his initials in highliter on the shirt.

<p class=dream>I was all, "what about writing the other rules? and he was all, "I got it" as in "I'll do it."  so he began to write.  then I was trying to figure out what I was feeling, what I was trying to stave off.  what is this feeling and I woke up.

<p>this is interesting to have actually caputured the moment in my dream just before transition to waking up.  it wasn't like the cats woke me up, but I was introspectively trying to figure out what I was feeling in the dream and woke up.

<p>hmmm

<p>pee, get a drink, sleep

<p class=date>4:32am</p>

<p>stretch turn sleep after almost making it to sleep

<p class=date>6:18</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>tossing and back and forth wake to almost alseep, seeing wende in my deams then waking up.

<p class=dream>then soon asleep and on an outdoor patio type thing with wooden slats and big oak trees around it,.  then asking my friend if I could ride his unicylce.  he was all, "um, my other friend is coming over," plus he had taken the pedals off the cycle.  So I just hopped onto my own unicycle and was riding it with zero problem at all. I was even on a giraffe  cycle, with the long neck and riding and had to duck below trees and even hit the trees a bit, but still rode through no problem.  I went almost all the way around the block where we lived from my third grade to 7th grade years, but my back wheel came out from under me part way around, but I was still riding on the front wheel, trying to get the back wheel re-aligned under my butt.  Never could quite do it, although I was in continuous riding motion the entire time.  the fact that my unicycle had two wheels never seemed odd.  Finally got around the bock and parked in my driveway and got off and woke up.

<p class=date>6:23am</p>

<p><p>gonna feed the cats now.</p>

<p><p>lovely that they did not wake me up last night (except spot for once just before I got to sleep for real.</p>
