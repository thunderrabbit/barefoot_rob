                        <p>Okay.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a week.</p>

<p>The Techno Cosmic Mass was pretty cool, but not super hella crazy phat
awesome like I had hoped!</p>

<p>Great pics though, and I scanned them and will put them up here
soon!!!!!  I promise!!</p>

<p>That Thursday I was at Ares Robotics at like 7:30am.  Wes and I
listened to Sarah on KTRU, and I called her a couple of times; she
said she would be on the air until 9:00pm, which was funny cause she
had just said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so awake!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I took four pictures of the altars before any work was done on them
that day:</p>

<p><a href="/journal/images/TCM/earth-before.jpg">Earth</a> <a href="/journal/images/TCM/air-before.jpg">Air</a> <a href="/journal/images/TCM/water-before.jpg">Water</a> <a href="/journal/images/TCM/fire-before.jpg">Fire</a></p>

<p>The top blue thing was a shower curtain.  Here it is tacked on, with
the water fountain <a
href="/journal/images/TCM/trial-run.jpg">squirting.</a>  Our mountain is visible in the foreground.</p>

<p>Drove everything up there to the George R. Brown and began to put it
all together.</p>

<p>In the center of the room was a big structure.  Here is <a href="/journal/images/TCM/wes.jpg">Wes</a> on it.<br />
Here is <a href="/journal/images/TCM/wes-head.jpg">Wes</a> under it.  Here it is being <a href="/journal/images/TCM/build-center.jpg">decorated</a>.</p>

<p>A <a href="/journal/images/TCM/video.jpg">video</a> crew recorded the event.  They didn&rsquo;t record me <a href="/journal/images/TCM/rob-lights.jpg">decorated</a>.</p>

<p>Dion, worked on the entrance, while Marisol showed off sleepy <a href="/journal/images/TCM/akira.jpg">Akira</a></p>

<p>The event started at 7pm.  I took pictures of all four altars.  Hmm. I
thought I did, but I musta only scanned two.</p>

<p><a href="/journal/images/TCM/earth.jpg">Earth</a> <a href="/journal/images/TCM/water.jpg">Water</a></p>

<p>I loved my water altar!  I took an <a href="/journal/images/TCM/water-art.jpg">artsy</a> pic of it.</p>

<p>There was a gospel singer and a <a href="/journal/images/TCM/rap.jpg">rapper</a>, and dancers and
all kinds of fun.</p>

<p>Some funny person put a bar of <a href="/journal/images/TCM/soap-frog.jpg">soap</a> in the water altar!<br />
The funniest thing is that someone <em>had</em> a bar of soap at the
event!</p>

<p>Dion took this picture of <a href="/journal/images/TCM/rob-frog.jpg">me</a> after the event.  My fingers
were wrapped up after I reinjured an old injury.</p>

<p>Afterward, we packed up the good stuff, threw away the rest and went
home.</p>

                        <p>I was on KTRU today &ldquo;helping&rdquo; Alexis interview a guy named Philip
Gayle.  At first I was anti-impressed with the interview; it seemed
trite and unprepared.  But that sponteneity really became great fun!  So
I went out there to see them.</p>

<p>I say &ldquo;helping&rdquo; because I was an unplanned uninvited guest.  But Alexis
was happy to have me join.</p>

<p>Philip Gayle is just a solo artist.  He had 2 little mandolins and would
make up songs:
&ldquo;I call this one &lsquo;I have too much sugar in my chloaca&rsquo;&rdquo;  and just scribble
and scratch the strings, for a full five minutes, including licking his
fingers and rubbing/squeaking the wooden surface of the mandolin&hellip;
crazy!</p>

<p>Alexis is fun; she helped train me as a DJ when I first started working
at KTRU, and now I randomly call her or say HI at her show.  She never
comes to see me&hellip; hmmm.</p>

<p><p>Wow!!</p>

<p><p>Today work was cool; a guy named Rey installed the circuit for our
SDSL connection.  That is just the &lsquo;local loop&rsquo; which connects to our
demarc, but not all the way to our router.  In other words, we are
closer to having DSL, but not yet.</p>

<p><p>I read/skimmed through the 258 page PDF file on the Netopia R7100
router which should be arriving soon via UPS.</p>

<p><p>Went to the KTRU weekly DJ meeting; station manager Meg was not
there, so Dennis filled in for her.  I must say the meeting was a lot
quicker!</p>

<p><p>Also helped Kevin with some javascript stuff.  He was coding some SAS
modules to output Javascript code for our website.  I had written the
javascript for my offline HTML application; I showed him how to
translate it to have his SAS module write it.</p>

<p><p>That was the boring part of my day.</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>After work, I drove down to Ares Robotics, where we are building all
of the altars for Techno Cosmic Mass tomorrow.  Talked to Richard who
was a bit frazzled; he wanted to have been this far completed last week,
but we are doing the best we can with the time we were given.</p>

<p><p>My water table had a layer of plastic over it and a pool at one end
so the pump could sit in it and push water to the top for the sprayers.</p>

<p><p>We didn&rsquo;t have sprayers, though.  Richard went with me to Home
Depot.  I had a great time, and I swear he was like a little kid in a
candy store.  Really.  In mis mind he had a vision of what he wanted to
build, but didn&rsquo;t really know exactly how he wanted to do it.  I
recognized his technique as he summed it up later, &ldquo;I just walk around
until I find the perfect thing to do the job.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>We bought the following:</p>

<p><p>12 foot garden hose, garden hose to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; adapter, four <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> X 12&rdquo;
pipes, four <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; T fittings, one 90 degree fitting, six <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; close
connectors, and five shower heads.</p>

<p><p>ascii picture time:</p>

<pre>    
   SSaaT=====T=====T=====T=====9
   S   ^     ^     ^     ^     ^

 S = garden hose  
 a = adapter
 T = T fitting
 = = 1/2" pipe
 9 = 89 degree fitting
 ^ = shower head
     close connectors are between S and a and connecting all the ^
</pre>

<p><p>We also grabbed some blue pastic tarp and a blue shower curtain and
some blue paint and some teflon tape and some lights.  Back at the shop
tonight we connected all the plumbing and layed out a design for the
plastic tarp (as a skirt around the table) and the lights.  The mountain
fountain that Wende and I made will cover the pump.  It will be
fantastic; I am ecstatic!!</p>

<p><p>Madeline&rsquo;s Earth Altar is not as far along; Richard asked if I can be
in charge of helping her get it finished tomorrow.  No problem.  Hers
will be relatively simple; no moving parts or flowing water or anything.</p>

<p><p>When I got home, there was a message from the mom of a friend of
mine, telling me about the TCM and that I might want to go!!  Yay!  The
word is out there!</p>

<p><p>I am to be back at Ares at 7:30am.  It&rsquo;s 11:30pm now.  Good night!!</p>

<p><p>With Love
<br>- Rob</p>

                        <p>noon Wednesday 8 December 1999</p>

<p>Today at work I&rsquo;m reading all about Netopia R7100 router which we will use
for SDSL soon.  258 page PDF document on the web.  I&rsquo;ll get to program the
firewall and learn how to hook this sucker up to replace our T1 and its
router.  I think it will practically be as simple as disconnecting one
cable from the T1 router and connecting it to the DSL router.  Sweet!!</p>

<p>During testing, before this simple switchover, I think I&rsquo;ll have the DSL
router connected directly to my machine so I can have a 416k modem all to
myself!  &ldquo;oh yes sir, I&rsquo;m still testing it.  Probably a couple more days to
make sure it&rsquo;s perfect.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>KTRU was great fun today!  I didn&rsquo;t have a theme, but had a few
excellent segues.  One was priceless!  I was playing the Sounds of North
American Frogs CD, which consists of hundreds of tracks.  Most of them
are about 17 seconds long (a few are longer) and of the following
format:</p>

<pre>
This frog, the blahblahbinous blahvine, has a trill twitter sound much
like its cousin, the bluhvine bloovious.   

[Trrriiillllllllll]   [Trrrriiillllllll]    [Trrriiillllllllll]  
[Trrrriiillllllll]    [Trrriiillllllllll]   [Trrrriiillllllll]   
[Trrriiillllllllll]   [Trrrriiillllllll]    
</pre>

<p><p>The spoken part is a very dry humorless voice.  I played about 7
tracks and then just as he was done speaking, I cut off the frog CD and
started a throat singing of India CD, and it sounded so perfect!</p>

<p><p>Anyone listening closely should have gotten a good chuckle.</p>

<p><p>Wende and I are going to work on the mountain fountain!!</p>

<p>Wende and I spent the greater portion of today down south of downtown,
mostly at Ares Robotics where we are working on all four different
altars.  When we arrived, the table for the water altar had no legs and
no top. It was just a frame of two-by-fours.  A man named Terry worked
on it, adding the legs, reinforcing them, then adding the top.</p>

<p>During this time Wende and I spray painted our mountain fountain, first
with a rust proof primer, and then with two different colors of fleck
paint.  We spent a lot of time just waiting around until finally Wende
had to leave around 5:45pm.  It was difficult for us to feel like our
time was being used wisely; we played some, talked some, but mostly just
waited.</p>

<p>After Wende left, I drove down to Garden Ridge Pottery to find some fake
moss to line the bottom of the altar.  They didn&rsquo;t have plastic moss,
but some wood shavings painted dark green and light brown.  I bought 18
one pound bags of the wooden fake moss.  $2.88 + tax per bag.</p>

<p>Then to Home Depot where I bought a pump that will pump water up to the
top of the altar to rain back down upon it.  $52 + tax for it.</p>

<p>Back to Ares Robotics where I tested out the pump - it could spray a
spout about 4 feet in the air without a hose attached.  Nice!</p>

<p>It was pretty late so I headed home.  Wende completed her meeting and we
went to Taco Bell!  (Do you see a trend?)</p>

the store to see if I was forgetting anything.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will that Stuff work to seal the gap around my air conditioner?&rdquo;  She
has asked her landlord to fix it since the summer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what it&rsquo;s for!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you get an extra bottle of Great Stuff for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I grabbed 2 more bottles; something told me I would need them for the
mountain.</p>

<p>Drove home and turned my mountain upside down to try to seal the holes
from the inside.  It did take all three bottles; I sprayed a layer from
the center of the cone most of the way toward the top.</p>

<p>At 10pm we went to Mission Burrito while we let it harden for 2 hours.</p>

<p><p><hr align="left" width="25%"></p>

<p>Ate burritos (and a bit of Amy&rsquo;s Ice Cream) and then headed home.</p>

<p>It was 11:10; and I turned on my little portable gas heater (old timey
kind with decorative ceramic bricks) cause it&rsquo;s getting cool (40F at
night).  We sat in front of it under my comforter, as if in front of a
roaring fireplace.</p>

<p>At 11:20 Wende was all, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s take a nap for 40 minutes until it&rsquo;s
done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We lay snuggled in bed and suddenly, it was morning.</p>

                        <p class="date">22:32 Sunday 5 December 1999</p>

<p><p>The mountain is pretty much complete.  Well, except for the painting it part.  It basically looks like a big pile of shaving cream.  I love it!  I have had such big great fun building this thing, and testing it&hellip;  I think I will build a fountain to install permanently in my living room somewhere.  Some kinda fountain with a long and winding path for the water to traverse.</p>

<p><p>Today we spent pretty much all day on this project, though a lot of time was required to simply let the Great Stuff harden for 2 hours after each application.  I worked on <a href="indigoangel.cjb.net">Indigo Angel</a> website during one 2-hour span, and in the next 2 hour span, Wende and I went to Indigo Angel where we grabbed some quartz crystals to decorate the mountain in some manner, and then zipped back home just in time to watch Simpsons and Futurama.</p>

<p><p>From Indigo Angel, to Wende&rsquo;s house where she fed her cats and we peed.  Then she was all, &ldquo;okay, let&rsquo;s grab a bite to eat at Taco Bell, then zip over to your house for The Simpsons.&rdquo;  It was 6:43; that left 17 minutes.  &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Zipped to Taco Bell; I dropped her off and turned the car around to wait for her.  Soon as she came out, I pulled out of the spot, she hopped in saying, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not going to believe this,&rdquo; and we sped away.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What, you forgot my taco?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Nope.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You got Root Beer instead of Dr. Pepper?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Nope.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;They were out of cheese.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh.  That&rsquo;s funny.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>She wasn&rsquo;t kidding, but it is still funny.</p>

<p><p>Zippy zipped home and ran upstairs.  Turned the TV on.  30 seconds later the chorus of voices called, &ldquo;Ahhhhhh  The Simpsons&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I greatly enjoyed the episode.</p>

<p><p>Futurama was pretty funny too.</p>

<p><p><hr align="left" width="25%"></p>

<p><p>By then the mountain was ready for a test run.  Took it outside to the parking lot, tossed an extension cord out the window to run the pump, filled a bucket with water for the pump to use, plugged it all in, and watched it run, checking to see if the water would drain down the mountain the way I wanted.   Mostly it didn&rsquo;t, but simply poured down into holes between the lumps of hardened foam.  I marked the spots with a pen so I could fill them and try again.</p>

<p><p>Filled the spots and I think it&rsquo;s pretty much ready to go.  I&rsquo;m in the latter half of a 2 hour hardening phase.</p>

<p><p>Work tomorrow and then on Tuesday we will all meet and hopefully get all this stuff finished up.</p>

<p><p>With Love

                        <p>Yay!</p>

<p>Great fun at work today; got to learn some new SAS stuff.  I pretty much
don&rsquo;t like the language - it&rsquo;s not strictly structured like C, sloppy
variable typing and sloppy function calls.  but I can handle it!</p>

<p>Oh, and the best thing of all- I asked if I could be paid today for the
past week of work instead of waiting until next official payday, and Karla
was like, &ldquo;no problem!&rdquo;</p>

<p>YAY!  I need the cashola to cover the cost of the water altar and stuff.
 And to buy some happy gifts for my homies!</p>

<p>See ya!</p>

<p class="note">(transcribed from my diary)</p>

<p><p><h1>OH MY GOD!!!</h1></p>

<p><p><h1>It&rsquo;s like like   - &hellip;  ===    EEEEEE !!!!!!!</h1></p>

<p><p><h1>2000 is right around the corner!!!!</h1></p>

<p><p><h1>Just like &hellip; Bang! and it&rsquo;s gonna be here!!!</h1></p>

<p><p>Me an&rsquo; Wende are at * Star Pizza.</p>

<p><p>Today I worked on my mountain fountain for water altar at Techno
Cosmic Mass.  Did three different applications of Great Stuff insulation
foam.  It&rsquo;s foamy and then hardens so it can be carved or painted or
whatever.  It should look pretty awesome but wil definitely need tons of
work tomorrow (and probably 2 more cans of Great Stuff).</p>

<p><p>Also replied to Fred&rsquo;s unicycle message:</p>

<p><p><pre>
I love it!!!!!</p>

<p>It will take some practice.  I spent 2 or 3 hours practicing in one day
and was able to roll about 2 or 3 wheel revolutions.  This is not
astonishing, and would likely not get you to class, unless you had a
pretty fuckin&rsquo; big unicycle, but it&rsquo;s a start.

<p><p><hr class=left></p>

<p><p>After Star Pizza I rented Simpson&rsquo;s #4 tape (&ldquo;Bart Gets and F&rdquo;
(better known to me as the Snow Day episode (Quimby: &ldquo;I hereby
pronounced this day to be Snow Day, the funnest day in the history of
Springfield!&ldquo;)) and an old Halloween Special including &ldquo;Hungry are the
Damned&rdquo; and something else and Bart as the Raven (James Earl Jones:
&ldquo;Quoth the raven:&rdquo;  &ldquo;Eat my shorts!&rdquo; interrupts Bart)) and A Brief
History of Time.</p>

<p><p>Watched Brief History of Time before playing Ultimate.  Wende fell
asleep during the movie - I enjoyed the film, especially the latter
half.  Mostly it was a 100% geeky movie, featuring interviews of a bunch
of incredibly brilliant people who knew/know Stephen Hawking.</p>

<p><p>Got to UH around 11pm for Ultimate Frisbee.  Five people were already
there to play, and the field was soaked and muddy. (It had been raining
pretty much all day) I arrived and we agreed to play a game of 3 on 3.<br />
We chose teams arbitrarily, and my team got STOMPED severely.  The score
was 7 to 1 when one of their guys slipped and fell sliding his knee
across a shell in the field and gashed it open.  We played a bit longer
without him and they were still scoring against us!  Mr Gashed Knee
needed to leave, so the game ended (he had ridden with another guy who
was playing).  His knee was still crazy dirty, so I showed him where a
faucet was nearby.</p>

<p><p>Back home, woke Wende up and ate ice cream and watched the Simpson&rsquo;s
episodes.  Fun fun stuff.</p>

<p><p>With Love
<br>- Rob</p>
