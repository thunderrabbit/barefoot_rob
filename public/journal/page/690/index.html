<p><p class=date>9:20 AM Wednesday, August 12, 1992</p>

<p><p>Day 3 of St Joseph Hell Week.  Last night I went to Laura&rsquo;s and
helped them load her truck.  I was lots of help.  Laura said I
probably made it go twice as quickly.  We were up till about 1AM, at
whcih point her dad went to bed, and I crashed on her floor.  She woke
me up at 2am and we moved to the couch bed.  As we lay there and
cuddled, I told her that I Loved her as much as I&rsquo;ve Loved any of my
girlfriends.  She was happy to hear that.  We woke at 6AM and she
walked me out.  We stood between her mailbox and the moving van to say
our last goodbyes.  I told her &ldquo;I meant what I said last night.&rdquo;  She
said &ldquo;thankyou.&rdquo;  We hugged tighter.  She said, &ldquo;it will be fun
keeping in touch via internet.&rdquo;  I agreed.  She said &ldquo;Parting is such
sweet sorrow.&rdquo;  We unhugged and I pulled the pineneedles off my feet
that had stuck there.  I said &ldquo;see you later&rdquo; and walked to the van.
I got home at 7AM and crashed until 9AM.</p>

<p><p>Dude.  Irma Norris called me today to basically accept my
application to work for Good Morning America next week 3AM - 1PM each
day.  Total Total coolness.  RIGHT!!!  I&rsquo;m going to meet her sometime
on Friday to fill out paperwork.  They wil be broadcasting from Hyatt
Regency in downtown.  She said there is no telling what I might be
doing.  I may drive to &amp; from the Lancaster Hotel.  I may be helping
in the studio moving cameras or whatever.  Dudeness.</p>

<p><p class=date>7:38 AM Tuesday 11 Aug 92</p>

<p><p>Last night I went to Bizmart looking for a binder to hold some of
my small computer manuals.  They only had 1 inch binders, so I went up
to the front desk and totally flirted with Mary, the long brown haired
girl who was up there.  She was quite helpful and spent several
minutes helping me look through a catalog to find the binder I need.
I stood around and talked with her for a while, then I went and looked
at some office supplies.  I didn&rsquo;t find what I wanted, so I came back
and flirted with her again.  I prompted a questioning phone call from
her supervisor after I spent fully 2 minutes watching the minute hand
on the clock move.  Heh heh.  I then filled out a bizmart Business
discount card, for Marcel &amp; my MR Laboratories.  Cool.  I listed us as
a fabrication company, since we&rsquo;re going to make Temp-o-spoon.</p>

<p><p>Then I went to Soundwaves and purchased the CD of Two Nice Girls. I
had never heard their stuff, but they are based in Austin, and I saw a
couple of T shirts advertising them when I worked in Kroger.  They are
mostly vocals and accustic guitar.  They are also totally lesbian.
Cool.  One of the songs describes how much worse it is to love a man -
&ldquo;I spent my last 10 dollars (on birth control and beer.)&rdquo;  I&rsquo;ve
listened to it once.  Today is day 2 of my full time week at St
Joseph.  Later</p>

<p><p class=date>12:30 AM Sunday 9 August 1992</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Today&rdquo; I woke up without an alarm at 6:30AM Astroworld!
Astroworld! Astroworld!  I played Blockout and went to Kroger to get a
birthday card for Yolanda, the girl at the library at UH.  Then I went
to Astroworld.  I got there at 9:35 and they opened the gates at
9:45AM.  I waited around until Marcel got there with his siter Mimi
and her friend from Iceland, Hline.  The first thing we did when we
saw eachother was to throw the invisible frisbee back and forth.  We
did some pretty cool throws and catches, and the girls knew we were
wierd.  Cool.  We first went to Cyclone, but it was down.  A dude
named David was at the gate, and we gave him the NutAward with the
understanding that we would get it back.  Then we headed toward the
Sky Screamer.  We made it to the Viper instead.  Marcel and I rode
that in the second to last car, with me on the right hand side.  It
was totally cool.  Then we rode on Excalibur, and Marcel rode on the
right.  I told him he totally had to get some grass on the very last
corkscrew that the train makes.  He didn&rsquo;t get it.  However, I got to
hit 2 of the bigger poles, and I announced the fact that you can hit
42 posts during the ride.  Then we went to Sky Screamer.  I got a rock
and did the floating rock trick.  We rode again, and I did it again:
We begin to fall, I drop the rock, we watch it tumble, (otherwise
motionaless relative to us) I caught it, I throw it way out in front
of us.  Mimi was rather disappointed that I threw it, since it was a 2
in a row Sky Screamer Rock. Then we went to Greezed Lightning, but it
was closed.  Crap.  So we rode XLR8.  Marcel and I rode in the back
back car, me on the left.  Then we went back to the Cyclone.  It was
open this time, so we rode on it.  We got to the top of the line, and
in order to synchronize things so that Marcel and I could ride the
same train, we let a couple go in front of us.  After they were in
line for a while, and we determined that we would be on the Blue
train, Marcel said, Hey Rob, did you hear about the problems they had
with the red car?  etc etc.  The girl turned around kinda like, oh
thanks for putting me on the faulty train.  It was funny.  Then we
rode the Ultra Twister.  That was the first ultra long line.  But
Marcel &amp; I rode in the front car.  Very cool.  I was on the right.
Then Marcel left us so that he could locate Alise and April at the
entrance, so I went with Mimi &amp; Hline.  We rode Excalibur, and I
<em>did</em> get grass on the last turn. Then we rode Joustabout as it
started to rain.  I gave Mimi a back massage while we were in line for
Joustabout.</p>

<p><p>Then we rode Warp 2000.  I rode with Mimi in car # 9.  Then we met
Marcel back at the fountain at the main entrance.  For a moment (or 2
(no one knows)) we were on opposite sides of the fountain facing away
from eachother.  Then Mimi saw Marcel&rsquo;s shirt.  She goes, &ldquo;Oh, there
he is!!&rdquo;  So I turned around and yelled, &ldquo;Marcel!!  Hey Marcel!! Over
here!&rdquo;  Check this out: Marcel stood up and put his hand up to his
eyes like he&rsquo;s searching for something but he continued to face away
from me.  That ws so funny.  I yelled, &ldquo;No No!! Over here!&rdquo;  He turned
around and saw me, as did Alise &amp; April, who were sitting beside him.
He came around to the other side of the fountain, and as he did, a
dude who we don&rsquo;t know shook his hand, &ldquo;Hey, Marcel!  how&rsquo;s it going?&rdquo;
Pretty funny.  Then we went to Adventure Rivers of Texas.  Before I
got in line, through, I went in the Exit of the Cyclone and found
David and got the Nut Award back.  Total coolness.  We rode Adventure
Rivers.  Me in the back of the raft with Marcel on the Pecos river.
We told the girl there that we were going to be the 1996 Olympic Luge
team.  Cool.  We started down the thing and I splashed wter on Marcel
and he splashed water on me and I lay back and flopped my arms
backward and got totally wet.  We hit the bottom of the thing and
Totally splashed.  People in the line cheered.  Cool.  Then we went
passed the KRBE van at the AstroNeedle, and I got to meet Paul Cubby
Bryant.  He was really cool.  I told him that I had to leave though,
before the broadcast was to start.  Crud.  We went to Viper and rode
it again.  This time with me on the left.  Then I had to leave the
group for the Castle of Dreams Bad Movie Fest.  I shook everyone&rsquo;s
hand and thanked Marcel.  I went back over to see Cubby and I got to
watch him do his first part on the air.  Very cool.  Little kids were
like, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s talking! Wow!&rdquo;  So I pointed at him like, &ldquo;Yes, right
here.  This is the guy who&rsquo;s live on the radio - and <em>I&rsquo;m</em>
standing right beside him.&rdquo;  I talked to Cubby a bit more and he would
get me on the air if I could stay a bit longer.  Unfortunately I
couldn&rsquo;t, so I told him just to say HI to me over the air.</p>

<p><p>I went back to the van - I never heard him say HI.  I went to the
Castle Party and I wish I had stayed at Astroworld.  I did at least
get to meet Scout Seven and Homer the Brave.  He&rsquo;s cool.  I didn&rsquo;t get
to meet them, though since we only watched the supid movies.  Fuck. At
the end, Jack Dracula called and was describing to us his eyeball
removing job.  I feigned sleepiness and I left at 11PM and Laura came,
too.  She and I took a shower together and now she&rsquo;s asleep and I&rsquo;m
about to join her.  Later</p>

<p><p class=date>7:17AM, Sunday 9 August 1992</p>

<p><p>Laura spent the night over here and she has just left.  She would
like for me to come over one last time, but I fear for the van&rsquo;s
health.  I wish I could be there to see her off&hellip; I told her that I
would write to her.  I&rsquo;m tired-going to sleep&hellip;  When I wake up, it&rsquo;s
clean the house time</p>

<p><p class=date>1:30 AM</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Today&rdquo; I cleaned the house including mounting the power strip for
my computer on my comuter desk, and screwing the screws into my wooden
chair.</p>

<p><p>Today (Monday 10 Aug &lsquo;92) I have to do laundry and start my full
time work schedule for the week.  Erg. (10-6:30 eachday)</p>

<p><p>Good night</p>

<p><p class=date>12:15 AM Friday August 7, 1992</p>

<p><p>Wednesday at House of Pies, Marcel, Will &amp; I played frisbee in the
parking lot.  Then James showed up and we 4 played and then we went in
to eat.  Jodi showed up after a while and joined us, and then Laura M
and her friend Gina (sp) came.  Gina had braces, and she sat next to
me.  RIGHT!!!  We flirted a little during our meal.  At 11:30PM I had
to leave to pick up Laura W at Hobby airport.  As I was leaving, Gina
asked if I wanted her to escort me out.  I said &lsquo;sure.&rsquo;  However, Will
was blocking her from getting out, and she didn&rsquo;t want to make a big
scene, and I didn&rsquo;t want to make a big obvious flirtation scene so she
ended up not escorting me out.  If she had I was in such a mood that I
would have stated bluntly, &ldquo;I have a braces fetish.  May I kiss you?&rdquo;
I would have done it.  I swear.  Oh well.  I left and got Laura and I
spent Wednesday night at her house.  I spent all Thursday there, too.
It was fun, and I called Castle of Dreams (we&rsquo;re currently building a
giant wooden roller coaster on the cloud) and read a Foxtrot cartoon
book.  I just got home at 11:30PM and returned Marcel&rsquo;s call.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Tomorrow&rdquo; we might play nuclear war at Laura&rsquo;s depending on if I
can call her and how late she wants to do it.  I&rsquo;d love to go, since
Gina might be there.  But it can&rsquo;t be too late, &lsquo;cause Saturday is
Astroworld!  RIGHT!!!  If I see a girl at Astroworld with
braces&hellip;. watch out.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m going to meet Marcel and Alise and April there at 9:45 AM.
We&rsquo;ll play until we drop or until I have to leave for the Castle of
Dreams Bad Movie Fest.  Total Cool.  I hope I&rsquo;m not too totally heart
broken by leaving Astroworld that early.  I haven&rsquo;t been there in 2
seasons&hellip; I wonder if I&rsquo;ll kiss either April or Alise?  or both?
Will they have braces?  Will they be too young?  We&rsquo;ll find out.
Later</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Today&rdquo; I got a check from Nishika for $698.50.</p>

<p><p>RIGHT!!!</p>

<p><p>That is totally cool.  I shall deposit it and $100 cash tomorrow.
There is a totally beautiful girl visible in the next building.  She
has on a white long T shirt and was sitting at the table eating and
reading.  She&rsquo;s blonde.  I watched her for several minutes, but it
seems she&rsquo;s left the room for good.  How do I meet her?  Hmmm.</p>

<p><p class=date>11:40PM Tuesday, August 4, 1992</p>

<p><p>Today Heather and I got up way early and went to UH to get
financial aid stuff done and to help me find a job.  We located a cool
one: work as a gopher for Good Morning America 3am to 1PM August 17
through 21 while the convention is in town $50 per day.  I called the
lady and she&rsquo;ll call me back tomorrow.</p>

<p><p>I also worked on my budget program.  It&rsquo;s coming along much better
than last time.  I&rsquo;m totally drawing it out and designing the objects
carefully before I code anything.  Marcel called and we are going to
House of Pies tomorrow at 10:30PM.  Laura called and I&rsquo;m picking her
up from the airport tomorrow at midnight.  Marcel called again and I&rsquo;m
going to Astroworld with him on Saturday.  That&rsquo;s the day of the
Castle of Dreams Bad Film Fest.  So we are Astroworlding in the AM and
I&rsquo;m going to the Film Fest in the PM</p>

<p><p>I also got to talk to Jami, Molly&rsquo;s blonde friend up in IL, who was
born in Canada.  She was fun.  I&rsquo;m going to write her a letter soon.
Later</p>

<p><p class=date>9:30PM 2 August 1992 Sunday</p>

<p><p>Today was my last day at Kroger.  I saw Angela (Pauline) from House
of Pies.  I said, &ldquo;Is this Angela from House of Pies?&rdquo;  She was like,
&ldquo;Oh my God&rdquo; and started fixing her hair back a bit.  It was funny.
She said, &ldquo;and this is Robert from House of Pies.&rdquo;  I hadn&rsquo;t
recognized him since he shaved his beard and grew a moustache.  A lot
of their stuff didn&rsquo;t scan for some reason&hellip; Heh heh.</p>

<p><p>I went to Heather&rsquo;s today and we had a JAM session.  Tuesday we are
going to UH and we&rsquo;ll get my ass a job.  We&rsquo;ll try the Learning
Support Services (LSS) where they do tutoring, and the job bank and,
Central Site Computing for a job for me.  We&rsquo;ll also look at financial
aid for HL&amp;P kids&hellip;  It&rsquo;s lightning &amp; storming a lot.  More rain than
anything though.</p>

<p><p>Today I happened to turn on the Olympics to men&rsquo;s high bar
routines.  <b>Holy Shit!</b>  They are so <em>bad</em>!!!  Doing shit
like 1.5 flips over the bar and triple back flip dismounts.  Check
this out:  American Trent Dimas stood for a moment and moved his head
through all the maneuvers in his routine.  At the end it looked like
he did a triple back and stuck the landing perfectly.  I told Molly
this as he did the head motions. (She was on the phone with me)  I was
right.  He did his whole routine kick ASS and he Stuck his triple
back.  He got 9.875 and won the gold.  RIGHT!!!</p>

<p><p class=date>8:28 AM Saturday 1 August 1992</p>

<p><p>This is my last weekend to work at Kroger.  Laura and I went to
Kroger last night; I had a meeting there about the security
checkpoint.  She read magazines until I was done.  During the meeting
I tickled the shit out of Cheryl, on whose chair arm I sat during the
meeting.  Cool sentence.  Not.  I didn&rsquo;t totally tickle the shit out
of her, but she was begging me to stop.  Very fun.  today, I&rsquo;m the 3rd
checker to come in.  Carol = 7-3 Cheryl = 8-4 me = 9-5.  I might get
to be on express. That&rsquo;d be cool.  I&rsquo;m in the mood to start working on
my budget program.  I think I will get 3 days worth of pay at Kroger.
I worked Thursday last week.  Word.  Later.</p>
