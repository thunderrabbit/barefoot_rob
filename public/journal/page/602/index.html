Dear Rob,

Thank you for using the Priceline for Gasoline
service.  Our records indicate that you visited
River Oaks Exxon, Houston on 7/28/00 8:28:00 PM
and pumped 21.2 of Regular Unleaded at a pump price
of $1.53 per gallon.  As a result you over pumped
your prepaid gasoline purchase by 1.2 gallons. Our
policy is to honor your prepaid price of $1.41 per
gallon (or the pump price if it is lower) for up to 5
additional gallons. We have charged your credit
or check card on file with us $1.69 for these
additional 1.2 gallons of gasoline.

HI

I think there is a flaw in your logic:

If I am allowed 5 gallons over my requested amount
(which was 20 gallons), then I may pump up to 25
gallons.

I pumped 21.2 gallons, which is not more than 25
gallons.

Please do not charge me extra for the 1.2 gallons.

    Thanks!
    - Rob

Hello,

I think your auto-reply did not read my email.

I did NOT pump more than 5 gallons over.

Please have a human read the original message you
sent me!

21.2 gallons is LESS THAN 25 gallons.

Please do not charge me extra for 1.2 gallons.

Please have a lovely day.

Dear Rob:

Thank you for your recent e-mail.

When you go to the station to pump your prepaid
gasoline, you may pump as much as you need, as
long as you do not exceed the total number of
gallons on your Prepaid Gas List.

Please note that if you over pump by less than 5
gallons, we will charge your credit card your
prepaid price. As you had overpumped 1.2 gallons
we have charged you with your prepaid price of $1.41
which amounts to $1.69.

George-

In the original message sent by you guys, it stated
that we pumped 21.2 gallons.

21.2 gallons is not more than 5 gallons over 20
gallons.

Please for goodness sakes admit that.  Just please
admit that 21.2 gallons is not more than 25 gallons.

Then please explain why your computer believes we
pumped 5 gallons over.

Dear Mr. Nugen:

Thank you for your e-mail.

We apologize for the confusion regarding overpumping. Our records
indicate that you have over pumped 1.2 gallons and since it falls below
the 5 gallon overpump limit we have charged your credit card for 1.2
gallons at your prepaid price ($1.41 per gallon) for each gallon
overpumped.

To make it more clear, please note that if you over pump by 5 gallons or
less, we will charge your credit card your prepaid price for each gallon
overpumped. If you over pump by more than 5 gallons, we will charge your
credit card the retail pump price for each gallon overpumped.

Please check the status of your account 24 hours a day on our Web site

Thank you for inquiring about Priceline for Gasoline. We look forward to

<p class=date>8:23pm CDT Monday 21 August 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Work was stinky today.  On Friday I gave an ETA of Monday to our
client that my project would be done.  Kevin said he could help me on
Monday.</p>

<p><p>However, Kevin got tied up with a problem he discovered in the
latest SAS version 8.1 (which replaced 8.0 that had a bug in the Share
thing)</p>

<p><p>8.0 bug was a memory leak that caused the system to slow down.
This could be &lsquo;fixed&rsquo; by restarting the dispatchers.</p>

<p><p>8.1 bug causes inaccurate results when combining data sets.  The
one has no easy fix that we know of.  Tonight Kevin is going to bypass
the Share (so that only 1 dispatcher will run tomorrow).  Pretty much
only 1 dispatcher will handle the load so we&rsquo;re not too worried about
it.</p>

<p><p>Because Kevin was mired in finding the source of this error, I got
relatively no help and consequently did not finish my part of the
project today.  I just hated having to tell our client &ldquo;1 more day.&rdquo;</p>

<p class=date>6:45am CDT Sunday 20 August 2000</p>
<p class=note>(dream)</p></p>

<p><p class=dream>Youth Council YRUU peeps were all floating around in a
pool, talking in small groups.  The life guard asked a couple of youth
who were walking around to either go back to the cabin or to join a
group in the pool.  Duncan&rsquo;s group of about 15 people floated at one
end of the pool as he described a game to his small crowd.  The
lifeguard found Duncan&rsquo;s voice too obnoxious and loud and asked that
he be more quiet.  Immediately Duncan and the lifeguard began tossing
insults back and forth.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Scene shifted so that Duncan was at a picnic table
beside the pool and he had lost a lot of weight after taking a
tremendous potty.  His group was now sitting quietly at the table, and
the insults were still flying back and forth.  I walked around back
beside Duncan and offered that he didn&rsquo;t have to react to the
lifeguard in such a negative manner.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Scene shifted again, and our picnic table overlooked a
couple of kids on bicycles where the bool had been.  The kids were at
Shannon&rsquo;s old house down at the end of Kathy Lane.  (That&rsquo;s the street
I lived on in high school.) One kid threw his bicycle onto of his
sister, and then hid in the shed out of fear from his dad, who came
out and saw us at first; started to come over, but we were all, no and
pointed back at his daughter under a bicycle in his yard.  He was
slightly freaked and didn&rsquo;t know what to do, but his kids came crying
out of the shed and his daughter lifted the bicycle off herself.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Then for some reason we had to walk; we were in fear of
a war going on nearby.  The ground on which we stood had been poisoned
in some way.  We started trudging across the field, and I started to
fly across the field.</p>

<p><p class=note>(lucid dream)</p>

<p><p class=lucid>I recognized I was dreaming and could hear the voices
of my friends saying something like, &ldquo;yeah there goes Rob, showing off
again..&rdquo;  Soon they were gone and I flew alone over this field.  I
flew like superman, and imagined jet propulsion blasting from my feet.
Very close to the tops of the stalks of wheat or whatever the field
was.  I was trying to catch food, and didn&rsquo;t really know what I could
eat, but I flew up higher into some tree branches and tried to catch
some humming birds, which seemed small and bite-sized.  I never caught
one, but kept flying faster and faster over the trees and then into
the burned out shell of an old house.</p>

<p><p class=lucid>Still flying inside the house, but had a little
difficulty manuevering in the small space.  I kept telling myself it
was a dream; I could do anything I wanted.  I flew out a window of the
house over a courtyard entire enclosed by the house, but open to the
outside air.  I began to lose my ability to fly, but stated to myself
as an incentive to keep flying that if I touched the ground I would
force myself to wake up.  I was flying, more like floating in a
standing position, with my jet propelling feet keeping me aloft.  I
pointed my arms and made fists at the ground, and jet propelled with
my fists as well.  This worked and I started to fly upward again, and
even gather speed within the small courtyard.</p>

<p><p class=lucid>I willed myself to fly out of the courtyard and back
into the house through a small window, hoping and expecting a
delicious glass smashing sound, but I basically missed the window and
flew half through the wall above it and half through the window.  No
crashing at all; I just went through with no interaction.</p>

<p><p class=lucid>On my way back out of the house, I began to lose the
dream quality, and felt my awareness back in my body and felt the
wavering wobbling sensation of an out of body experience.  Nice.</p>

<p><p>I recognized that my arms were above my head and were tingling from
lack of blood.  I lowered them to my sides and lay in bed for a while,
trying to get back to dream consciousness.</p>

<p><p>Peter merowled for food, I was almost able to ignore him, but I
realized it was probably actually time to feed him.  Looked at the
clock: 6:32.  Pete was right on schedule.  Smart cat.</p>

<p class=date>3:52am CDT Saturday 19 August 2000</p>
<p class=note>(dream)</p></p>

<p><p>anti racist workshop inspired</p>

<p><p class=dream>YRUU, we were in a house, and about to get on a bus to
go somewhere.  We were in a meeting and (Bitter Bitter) Kate walked
in, but she was like older and coming back from having been in YRUU a
couple of years ago.  I didn&rsquo;t recognizer her..  had heard her name
but not seen her.  It was late at night for this group of youth; we
were all talking..  kinda upstairs in a loft room thing and we heard
someone come in and it was Jen and she had brought Kate with her.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Then it was time for the group to leave so we were all
hopping into my van/bus thing but someone had left their sandals in my
dorm room, so I yelled down out the window at them who&rsquo;s shoes were
these and did they want me to bring them?  &ldquo;They&rsquo;re mine&rdquo; and yes,
from Jen and someone else.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Then we were on the bus and we were talking to a man
with dark skin from a country in Paraguay who was running to be
president of the US.  He described how he had little chance to become
president, but that the tide was slowly turning.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Scene shifted to like a parking lot with chairs all
around the perimeter.  A white man who was dressed in layers of ripped
up clothing was barely able to speak english asked me for some money.</p>

<p><p class=dream>The guy from Paraguay had lots of food and supplies -
he was backpacking across he US</p>

<p><p class=dream>I started cooking some eggs and forgot about them and
began talking to a man who appeard to be from the middle east.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I walked over to him and was all, motioning something
like, &ldquo;are you hungry?&rdquo; and then &ldquo;do you speak English?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>He said in perfect non accented English, &ldquo;yes, I am
teaching my kids German, old German, English, Hindi. He had two
infants with him - well toddlers, but they were in basket things and I
held out my hand to &ldquo;give me five&rdquo; and the one kid taught the other
how to do it by giving me five.  He was all, &ldquo;watch&rdquo; and slapped my
hand, and the other child did a sloppy job of it.  &ldquo;okay, turn your
hand over&rdquo; and then I brushed my hand to give him five.  He was a
baby; I didn&rsquo;t want to slap his hand.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Then their dad was all, &lsquo;what is this give me five?&rdquo;
and I taught him how to do it.  He did a bad job and missed my hand,
but hit my wrist the first time.  He showed me his country&rsquo;s custom of
kissing back of hand.  His skin was very dark and I kissed the back of
his hand.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Then my dad called me over, &ldquo;Rob need your help&rdquo; and I
was all, &ldquo;excuse me&rdquo; to the guy, and oops the eggs were pretty burnt.
Mimi was over near them and I was chanting some Beastie Boys lyrics as
I tried to salvage the eggs.  They weren&rsquo;t totally burned, but the
plastic spatulaa I had used was melted on the edge of the skillet.  I
threw it in the trash, and it seared a hole in the trash bag as it
fell into the garbage can.</p>

<p><p>Last night after Hobbit Cafe with Dad, Karen, Elise, Wende, they dropped
me off at KTRU for my shift.</p>

<p><p>This shift turns out to be the my last one of the summer semester as I
will be missing my next two Saturday night shifts.  (Super special thanks to
Donna for taking them!)</p>

<p><p>The phone rang only once during the first half of my show, not counting
Wende who called twice just to say HI.  When I commented over the air my
surprise at so few calls, I got a call immediately by two guys who I put on
speaker phone as I looked for their requests.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Do you have The Hippos?&rdquo;
<br>&ldquo;Um, okay - do you have Mot Skan?&rdquo;
<br>&ldquo;How about Dimitri in Paris?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I looked through our stacks for their requests and finally found Dimitri
in Paris.  I played the intro and first music track on the CD for them.</p>

<p><p>Then the calls started to arrive in earnest.  In the last 45 minutes of
my show, I had probably 9 calls!  Totally amazing.</p>

<p><p>One of the calls was from a woman named Mickey.  Jesse and I immediately
broke into &ldquo;Oh Mickey you&rsquo;re so fine, you&rsquo;re so fine you blow my mind Hey
Mickey!&rdquo;  I apologized to her - she&rsquo;s probably heard it a million times.
But she was all, &ldquo;No I like that! &rdquo; So we sang about 90 seconds of the
classic tune.  (who is it by?  Toni something?)</p>

<p><p>Mickey asked for something by Less Than Jake.  I knew we didn&rsquo;t have an
album by them, but I found her some random ska.  Then I found Less Thank
Jake on <em>Ska The Third Wave</em> or some such compilation.  Cool!</p>

<p><p>The last 3 tracks I played were a hip hop track by L Fudge, DJ Shadow,
and DJ Spooky to satisfy my turntablistic craving.</p>

<p><p>So the end of my last show of the summer was great fun!</p>

<p><p><em>Space Cowboys</em> was very cool.  Not necessarily worth seeing
twice, but I almost cried.  good camera work and computer graphics work
stuff.  Weird when they had the collision in outer space with the big
satellite..</p>

<p><p>I didn&rsquo;t dig the way our hero saved the earth, as he somehow landed
without crashing?  no way.  no way.</p>

<p><p>I got Madison&rsquo;s number at Whole Foods and we&rsquo;re going to go see <em>Red
Planet</em> sometime soon.  Wende doesn&rsquo;t want to go and gave her blessing
on our going to see it.  I&rsquo;ll suggest dutch treat so nothing seems weird.</p>

<p><p>Now we&rsquo;re at Hobbit Cafe for dinner.  It&rsquo;s Elise&rsquo;s last couple of days in
H-town; she&rsquo;s going back to Dallas soon.  I&rsquo;ll miss my almost-step-sister.</p>

<p><p>After KTRU, Wende picked me up and drove me to ultimate!  Very low
turnout this night, but we played 4-on-4 anyway.  Unfortunately, I had to
leave after the first game; I had stepped on a shell and kinda sliced my
heel.   Cut is about 3/16ths of an inch deep and 1.5 inches long.  Mostly
callous, but it did bleed some.</p>

<p><p>Fortunately, Mark L just arrived as the game was ending so he presumably
took my place.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m about to go see Wende&rsquo;s parents and stuff.  I&rsquo;ve pretty much decided
to treat them as warmly as I would my own parents..  I&rsquo;ll just assume they
are great and see what happens.  We&rsquo;re going to Chuy&rsquo;s for dinner.</p>

<p><p>Current language project is fine; it&rsquo;s nearly done ready for phase one to
be checked by our client.  I will probably come in on Sunday and work on it.
Wende will be at work; I have no life without her..  Do I?</p>

<p><p>Today Wende is cleaning our house; her parents are coming to visit this
afternoon.  These parents are her real dad and stepmom, who I have never
met.  Everyone who knows them has assured me that as soon as they meet me,
they will like me.  I feel fairly assured.</p>

<p><p>These are the parents who wouldn&rsquo;t acknowledge me for the first several
months that Wende and I were dating.  They didn&rsquo;t approve of us living
together without being married.</p>

<p><p>Today work has been going pretty well.  Still doing this language
translation thing for the same project I worked on yesterday.  We totally
redesigned how the translations were done yesterday.  Once we got that
figured out, it&rsquo;s been relatively speedy updating.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p></p>

<p><p class=dream>We were at SWUUSI (week long youth camp) inside a
building at a workshop. a boring workshop and it was more like a
lecture..  I was wanting to be outside playing.  Youth were coming in
disruptfully and the guy up front, who had been reading asked one of
the youth o read instead.  The youth (Ken, who was in our local LRY
and graduated in 1998 or so) was reading all quietly so no one could
hear.  I bruskly said, &ldquo;speak up,&rdquo; and the previous speaker chided
mean for not being more shill.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Then the room melted into us being outside a shopping
mall - basically the back of the room opened up into a parking lot,
where youth were playing catch with some shoes, but coming close to
hitting our group.  I was watching them through the reflection on the
wall and when I shoe almost hit me, I got up and threw it into a trash
can (in a disempowering way), instead of asking them to be more
respectful of our meeting.</p>

<p><p class=dream>They grabbed the shoe again and were tossing it around
the parking lot some more (there was a small amusement park in the
middle of the parking lot, with a white picket fence around it).  Phat
Pat and Ian were the one playing catch with the shoe.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Then my focus shifted to a car that was parked beside
the curb and youth were all around it and inside it, again being
disrespectful of the owner/advisor who was in the car.  Someone pulled
the car closer to the curb (like literally grabbed the door and drug
the car sideways) just to do it.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Then Amanda (youth from Bay Area) was all lamenting
that she had been unable to go search for natural gems back in some
secret hidden place where we were not supposed to be anyway.  Maybe in
a year or two.</p>
