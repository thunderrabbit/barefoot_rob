<p>Earlier today I was reading Colleen's journal entry
that indicated she had been online, but no one else
was online.</p>

<p>Just now I was thinking .... in a couple years this
won't be the case.  So many people will have their
internet connectivity as they walk around.  So there
won't be any more concept of "have to be at the
computer to chat."</p>

<p>We'll just chat.</p>

<p>It will be more like, "No one else had their
connection open," or "Everyone was DND," which, of
course, will mean, "everyone had their mode set to Do
Not Disturb."</p>

<p>In Europe now they use text messaging apparently
*all the time* as opposed to us in US, where it hasn't
really caught on yet.  It will come.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>While I'm kinda on the subject...</p>

<p>A couple months ago I predicted the following
scenario:  Web cameras are going to become
ridiculously prevalent, to the point that people will
just have to deal with the fact that they are probably
<em>always</em> being watched.</p>

<p>That's some years away before people get over it,
but in the interim, how will this transition occur?  I
predicted that the big fights will occur when people
are renting or leasing property, and the owner has a
camera installed.  Who has the rights in this
case?</p>

<p>I was thinking more along the lines of homes and
apartments, but just recently I found this <a
href="https://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/zd/20010620/tc/car_spy_pushes_privacy_limit_1.html">lawsuit</a>
about a guy in a rental car.  The company that owned
the car put in a GPS and charged him for speeding. 
Nice.  I was basically right.</p>

<p class=date>7:10am CDT Wednesday 27 June 2001</p></p>

<p>Last night after work, I watched the first half of Pulp Fiction,
writing different quotes to use as mugbook quotes at upcoming
rallies.  :-)</p>

<p>I also went back through all the mugbooks that I have kept over the
years (I seem to be missing more than I thought) and wrote down some
of the quotes from Pulp Fiction that I've used so far.  I know there
are more quotes that I've used, but I no longer have those mugbooks.
:-(</p>

<p>So, from the first half of the movie, I came up with the following
quotes, most of which have no colorful language, and that I think are
either funny (esp. taken out of context), or intriguing, or just cool.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>So that means there could be up to five guys up there?</p></li>
<li><p>Why don't you tell my man Vince here where you got the shit hid
at.</p></li>
<li><p>That gun goes against the entire idea behind piercing.</p></li>
<li><p>This is a seller's market.</p></li>
<li><p>It's on the wall by the two African fellows.</p></li>
<li><p>And five in there's one two three four five of us.</p></li>
<li><p>Well now I'm definitely not gonna tell you cause it's been
built up too much.</p></li>
<li><p>I gotta know what a five dollar shake tastes like.</p></li>
<li><p>I don't think Buddy Holly is much of a waiter.</p></li>
<li><p>I don't see Jayne Mansfield; she must have the night off or somethin'.</p></li>
<li><p>You seem like a really nice person and I don't want to offend you.</p></li>
<li><p>They talk a lot don't they?</p></li>
<li><p>I do believe Marsellus, my husband, your boss told you to take
me out and do whatever I wanted.</p></li>
<li><p>That's a little bit more information than I needed, Vince, but
go right ahead.</p></li>
<li><p>Don't be rude; drink your drink, but do it quickly.</p></li>
<li><p>Are you talking to me on a cellular phone?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you know who Marsellus Wallace is?</p></li>
<li><p>Alright, what I need is a big fat magic marker.</p></li>
<li><p>If you're alright, say something.</p></li>
<li><p>What's your thoughts on how to handle this?</p></li>
<li><p>Now if you excuse me, I'm gonna go home and have a heart attack.</p></li>
<li><p>No, you won't laugh cause it's not funny.</p></li>
<li><p>And now, little man, I give the watch to you.</p></li>
<li><p>It's time, Butch.</p></li>
<li><p>Great.  I never thanked you for dinner.</p></li>
<li><p>The name is spanish, but I am columbian.</p></li>
<li><p>Let's talk about the rich and prosperous Mister Butch.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep the light off.</p></li>
<li><p>You know what, I was thinking about taking a shower; I'm
stinking like a dog over here.</p></li>
<li><p>but it ain't gonna be the kinda money that we can live like
hogs in the fat house forever.</p></li>

<p>I'm reading a book about the Mysterious of Egypt, specifically the

<p>I got one significant thing done at work today, which will
hopefully be great for the peeps in Singapore.  It was a pretty fun
addition that I made for them.</p>

<p>Rode my bike to the bike shop to drop it off for its 30 day tune
up.  I called Wende before I left work to have her pick me up.  When I
got there, though, they were all backed up.  So I had to call Wende
back and tell her what's up.  I told her that instead of her picking
me up to drive to Spanish, I would just ride back up.  She was mad and
said fuck.</p>

<p>I guessed correctly that she was mad at me, and wondered if she
would come to class.  She did come, but said she also thought about
not attending.  Wow.  Musta been pretty mad.</p>

<p>Spanish was cool.  We learned articles of clothing:</p>

<p><ul>
<li>calcetines = socks</li>
<li>blusa = blouse</li>
<li>zapatos = shoes</li>
<li>pantalones = pants</li>
<li>pantalones cortos = shorts</li>
<li>falda = skirt</li>
<li>impermeable = raincoat</li>
<li>corbota = tie</li>
<li>sombrero = hat</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Wende and I are going to drop off her truck at the shop tonight so
we don't have to drive in traffic there tomorrow.</p>

<p class=date>22:54pm</p>

<p>We're back.  Good night!</p>

<p class=dream>With YRUU peeps and we were traveling up to OKC for a
rally.  Except we weren't driving; we were in suspended gondolas like
those that go slowly over amusement parks.  I was in a gondola with
Sarah from ultimte,  Colleen C, and Adam L.</p>

<p class=dream>We could see Nick C and Annie in a different gondola.</p>

<p>I don't remember much else.</p>

<p>Yesterday I was the first to show up for YRUU, then Susie S, then
Mark and Keith, then Meg, Katy, Susie R, who had the key to the
church.</p>

<p>Watched a movie called "The Man Who Planted Trees," which is a true
story about a guy who planted hundreds of thousands of trees in France
between 1910 and 1950 or so.  Quite amazing.</p>

<p>We talked about "what are we going to do?" and I suggested working
on our movie script, but no one seemed interested enough to actually
focus the discussion on that or to brainstorm or anything.</p>

<p>Instead we raided the kitchen, where Meg and I each debated for a
very short moment whether the strawberry cheesecake was fair game, and
we each had a piece of the strawberry cheesecake (Kate walked in and
assured us it wasn't very good, which is kinda funny that we were all,
"um should we have it?" then Katy proved that she had already had
some.)  (It wasn't like fall over laughing funny, but the irony was
there.)  ANYway, yeah cake, and some of them made coffee and then they
all decided to visit the Walmart for some Nintendo game for Keith and
other Walmart goodies.</p>

<p>I hung out with Susie R and discussed who were the possible new
leaders in the group, and wondered (as advisors must continually do)
how much leadership of our own to give the group.  I think if Amy L
wants, she could be a great leader next year (if she's not crazy-busy
with school).  And we wondered what activities the group might do.  I
still really like the movie idea.</p>

<p>I'll be gone for the next two weeks (a wedding (not mine!) in
Oklahoma) and then New Orleans Rally (I still need to register) and
then back at YRUU for a week, and then SWUUSI!</p>

<p>Wow.  This is from a friend of mine from YRUU back
in the day when I was in YRUU.  I knew her as Ginnie,
but she's apparently changed her name.</p>

<p>I snail mailed her some weeks ago and have gotten a
postcard from her (no return address), and this email 
(with return address)</p>

<p>SO Awesome to hear of her incredible journey!</p>

Subject: Gin in Rennes
Date: Sat, 23 Jun 2001 12:34:45 

greetings from the Camino, i am in a big city in
Bretagne, France (nw) and have taken care of alot of
business, like internet stuff and photo development
and the Festival of Music. HeeHee:) That party was
crazy, i didn't even get out until after 1am- and
there was still hundreds of thousands of people drunk
and dancing in the streets, hanging off the statues
and lots of extra friendly shoving. It was the summer
solstice party and groups were playing on almost every
corner and in the train station, bus station, in the
streets and all the plazas. It was a crazy party,
somewhat rare in France. A good way to celebrate my
first leg of the pilgrimage:). 

I have passed 5 people on the camino so far, the first
two had walked to Galicia two years ago, and invited
me to come stay with them for the night and share
stories of life and travels. They had a pretty good
map of the trail. A map is relative, the route i am
taking is one of the least traveled, and about once a
day(most of the time about 7 times) looses all
continunity, and i resort to my compass. The nice
thing about such a long walk alone,is there is no need
to worry, i will eventually arrive to where ever it is
i am going (or not). So far i have met the most
incredible country folk way off the trail. Most of the
creatures i meet along the way are cows, and they are
like courious puppies. Even large herds get up and run
over to meet me and walk and sometimes play silly
games with me until we come to the end of their field.
I learned that singing very loud stimulates my left
brain, and walking stimulates the right. To stay in
balance i sing alot(the cows listen, with curious
puppie dog expressions); the black and white cows are
the funniest. Enough about my friends the cows.
Singing soothes my poor feet, and inspires the deep
breathing i am working on. 

People seem very amazed about my pilgrimage. I was
followed out of the post office yesterday by someone
who needed spiritual healing regarding a psychosematic
ankle problem he has had. He knew that this pilgrim
could help him, and although it was a bit of a bizzare
exchange for me, he seemed to feel differently about
his problem. I told him pain was a part of life,
especially on a pilgrimage, getting over it and beyond
it is essential to maintan vitality. That is my small
lesson of the week, of the life. That was not the
first time i have had an encounter like that, but i
don't think it will be the last. It is kind of nice to
be a source of inspiration to someone beside myself. 

My trip to Le Mont St. Michelle (where i officially
began) along the northern coast of France was
excellent, i decided after really boring train rides
that i would hitch-hike a little, and wow did i meet
some great folks. i have started a short story about
my last è car rides. i hope they will be my last
automobile rides for a while. I worked on a delivery
truck for a day, was even offered a position! We
delivered stuff to the famious french bakeries,
ohlala! I was a bit crushed to find out that the
delicious crossiants come in a box!!! what, why can't
they export those boxes to the rest of the world,
cause there is no crossiant like one in the morning
here, it is amazing. A small but devine pleasure
indeed. 

I have been notified that my very good friend Dennis
¨The Bird Man¨ Smith died a few weeks ago. He worked
with raptors, and could even talk with and understand
those incredible birds; The day after i found out i
found a variety of a barred owl dead on the side of
the road. It had just been hit by a car, and even
though it suffered from a broken neck, i did a cardiac
massage anyway. I took it to a castle and burried it
in an oak grove, listening to an owl hoot in the tree
above. It was in someway a send off. I was his angel,
now he is mine. We never really loose each other
anyway. 

My idea is that i am leaving the city today, and
looking at the map that i have, it might be a while
before i get to another junction where i can find a
computer. Of course I never really know, anything
could happen. The route is anything but direct, even
on the map going north, than east, then south and in
general not really heading towards spain, but i don't
care, it is beautiful, i have my compass, guns are
illegal here, the people even when not friendly are
not in any way threatening or mean, and the adventure
is in every step. I hope to walk along the coast to
spain, or just walk along the coast for a long as i
want. A good friend of mine from Holland plans to walk
with me for a couple of weeks. Of course anyone who
would like to join me is welcome, but in terms of
domestic life, there is none. It is almost survival
(cheeze, bread and wine survivvvvvvval), no really, it
took me years to prepare for this trip and i feel
physically, mentally, spiritually and what is the
other???...well, prepared for what ever might happen.
I have run out of water a couple of times and that is
no fun, but life brings an oasis just when i hope it
will. Until the next adventure story, love and
laughter to you in big doses. ULTREA! gin

<p class=date>11:21pm CDT Saturday 23 June 2001</p></p>

<p>After watching Shrek, Wende and I grabbed a quick nap and then went
to Jason and Courtney's house (Jason works with Wende) for their
daughter Grace's first birthday party!</p>

<p>It was mostly a family-ish gathering around the pool with hot dogs
and foam balls and noodles in the pool.  I swam and splashed around
with Bill, talked with Wende and Darby, talked with Melissa, ate hot
dog and cake and had to leave relatively early to go to KTRU.</p>

<p>Great show at KTRU tonight, though I got off to a rocky start.  I
found a relatively super duper easy way to get all the tracks on the
computer.  I shared my findings with super cute Erin when she came in
at 10pm for her show.</p>

<p>During my show, Rob (who works with Wende) called me and I looked
for some artists for him.  Found Red Lorry Yellow Lorry - we have 7
albums on vinyl.  I played Mescal Dance off of Paint The Wagon (I
think).</p>

<p>Also talked to Sally who will be coming to Houston in a few weeks;
she will probably be a guest on the air with me on 14 July!</p>

<p>Erin's first song was Big Mess Orchestra covering Red Hot Chili
Peppers' "Give It Away," which features twin female singers who
actually enunciate the lyrics well enough to understand.  But, more
significantly, I reviewed the CD for KTRU!  Wheee!!</p>

<p><em>Shrek</em> is funny.  The movie got progressively funnier as it
evolved, and I loved the unexpected plot twist!!  I wonder how the
dragon got away and found them at the end.  Great movie, with lots of
funny references to modern pop culture.  Definitely funny for adults.
In fact, there were some things I was surprised to see in a G rated
movie.  But maybe I'm just old fashioned.</p>
