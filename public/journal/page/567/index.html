<p>Dinner at Molly and Will's was great and lovely
fun.  Dinner was fabulous thanks to Molly, and all the
glasses matched thanks to Will.  Eric and Meredith
actually arrived later than me an' Wende because they
first thought it was at Maggie and John's house.</p>

<p>After dinner we talked a bit and I helped Will work
on their 8000 piece puzzle of the painting on the
ceiling of the Sistine (sp) Chapel.  I was able to
place 6 pieces, including the two red pieces that Will
had been unable to place for some days!  I didn't show
will where I put them, and I didn't even <em>tell</em>
him that I placed them, but I wrote it in his puzzle
log book.</p>

<p>(He's keeping a log of the numbers of pieces placed
per day.  He's up to 6400 now.)</p>

<p>Wende's parents sent us their digital video
recorder so we can take it to Australia!  John helped
me figure out how to use it today.  Wende was all,
"there's a book in the camera bag."</p>

<p>"Tsk, Wende!!!"</p>

<p>Wrassled with their dog Scout for a while and then
went home.</p>

<p>I'm going to bed now, and will be up and back at
work tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>This morning Wende and I met with our American
Express financial advisor person, who gave us an
analysis of our financial situation, and suggestions
on how to reach our goal of retirement by age 55.</p>

<p>Fifty-Five?  Ack.  sooo far away!!</p>

<p>And the meeting took 2 hours; by the end I was
squirming in my seat wanting to be anywhere but in
that enclosed room.</p>

<p>"Any questions?"</p>

<p>"where do we sign?"  I figure we have paid them to
figure out what to do with our $, so they should just
do it.  Let me outta here!</p>

<p>At least I wasn't wearing shoes.  That helped give
some contrast to their suit and ties and
suspenders.</p>

<p>We ate fast food on the way back; I had Wendy's and
Wende had Taco Bell.  We ate inside Wendy's.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>At 4pm is our couples' counseling thing.  We're
going to dive into the emotions and crap surrounding
the time when I cheated on Wende back in 1999.  I hope
this session will allows us both to emerge
victorious.</p>

<p>After our counseling thing, we picked up Scott from Oak Forest
Automotive.  They gave me a quote of about $1000 to fix the brakes,
power steering, air conditioner.  We will leave it there Monday
morning before we go.</p>

<p>Souper Salad after we got Scott, and we met Julian and got 2 free
bowls of soup to take home because we spoke spanish with him!  The
bowls of soup are for our neighbor Jennifer because she is sick.</p>

<p>I'm about to go back to work for the evening to get this project
knocked out before we leave!</p>

<p>bluh gack blech grrr gigiggjdfkll;askfdljkdfjkl</p>

<p>I've been eating crappily all day - animal crackers
and Dr Pepper and a granola bar and some crackers, and
my brain isn't working for this SAS silliness.  sigh. 
bluh.</p>

<p>I wonder if in 10 years there will be available a
pill or tablet or a wafer or a snack bar that is
exactly the correct balance of nutrients a body needs.
 Just eat these nutrient bars and water all day and
have perfectly balanced nutrients flowing through the
body.</p>

<p>I just rode my borrowed unicycle to the post office
and back.  This is somewhat more challenging than
riding to the bridge due to the great amount of
traffic between here at the post office.  I
essentially have to cross two one-way streets, each
with four lanes of traffic.  One of them is easier to
navigate because there's a stoplight controlling the
traffic nearby.  The other street doesn't have a
traffic light quite as close, so I got off my uni and
walked across that street.</p>

<p>At the post office, I met a little guy (6 or 7
years old) who said he could juggle empty plastic
bags.  We didn't find any bags nearby so he didn't get
to show me.</p>

<p>As my brother Fred would say,</p>

<p>back to work.</p>

Would you grab me a diet sprite?  I am stuck on a call.  I'll pay you back.

<p class=date>11:02pm CST Tuesday 6 February 2001</p></p>

<p>Lately at work I've been hoping to finish a not-entirely-defined
portion of the G3 project.  The idea is that the Big Big Project that
I had been working on for months will be consolidated down to use
fewer, more generic pieces of code.</p>

<p>I've been creating a technique for the projects to host followup
surveys after each main survey.  The followup surveys are mostly
subsets of the original survey, but customized to each individual.
(Kinda) So I have been generifiying the process and storing more
information in the datasets to describe how everything should
work.</p>

<p>Yesterday I was not sure that I would be able to get this part of
the project satisfactorily finished by the end of this week.  Even
today I was not sure.  But after going in tonight for a couple of
hours, I think I'll be able to get it done.</p>

<p>During these couple of hours I did not write an astonishing amount
of cool code that suddenly assures victory, but I discovered that I
had already written super fly code that will make the job way way
easier than I thought it would be.  That's a wonderful feeling for me
as a programmer: To find some old code and think "wow; I really wrote
some cool code."</p>

<p>- - - - -</p>

<p>Today was the 3rd class of 8 for the Tuesday night spanish
classes.  In order to lessen the loss of brain power due to missing
two weeks while we're on vaction, Wende and I also attended the Monday
night spanish class for the past two weeks.  Yesterday we took class 4
of the same series of 8 classes.  As I mentioned previously, we will
miss class 5 in the series.  Tessy said that class will cover the verb
"ser."  Wende and I can learn that while we're away.</p>

<p>I plan to go to work pretty early in the AM tomorrow.  We'll see if
that happens.  I also plan to stay late tomorrow night.  That is more
likely to happen.</p>

<p>On Thursday, I hope we can take my car Scott in to the shop (for an
estimate) and then Wende and I have a meeting with our finanial
advisor, and then in the afternoon we have a meeting with our marriage
counselor guy.  So that day may kinda be screwed for getting a lot
done during the day.  I imagine I'll be in late at night on Thursday
as well.</p>

<p>At work today I got the pager.  Now if there are
any problems with the webserver, I will be paged
within 15 minutes.  This reminds me of being on Duty
at Telecheck, but there won't be people at the office
24/7 watching things.  Just the computers monitoring
themselves.</p>

<p>I will turn in the pager next Monday before Wende
and I leave for Australia!</p>

<p>Oh, and this pager can send email too.  That's
pretty cool and is just a glimpse of wireless
technology creeping into my life.</p>

<p>I just unied from work, down the street to the
bridge, across the bridge and to the school and then
back.  I must say that the seat on the unicycle is
much less comfortable since I had to reinsert the foam
padding instead of the 12" inflatable bicycle tube. 
The tube caught a hole somehow and I haven't taken the
time to buy a patch kit and patch it.</p>

<p>I still did relatively well, considering the pain
of sitting near the end of my journey.  I was able to
go all the way across the bridge (a man stopped before
he entered the other side, allowing me to pass.  "Good
afternoon."  "Good afternoon.") and all the way back
to my car at work, including down the big hump and all
the lumps in the sidewalk.  I dismounted gracefully
with the unicycle in front of me, just like Level One
unicycle skills require.</p>

<p>Aww yeah.</p>

<p>I played ultimate last night for the first time in a pretty long
time.  It was pretty cold; my little toes were numb for a lot of the
night.  I played well for 3 games and chose not to play the fourth
game.</p>

<p>Madeline came out to say HI.  She had called me while I was at KTRU
and I gave her directions and stuff.  She had been doing homework and
came out as the second game was ending and played during the third
game.  She did very well for her first time out!</p>

<p>We sat on the bench and talked during the fourth game.  Talked a
lot about Wende and me; Madeline helped me understand Wende's feminine
point of view.  For this I am very thankful.</p>

<p>So tired when I got home, and found Wende on the couch asleep.  In
her sleepy cute voice, "I'm sleepin' in the wrong place."  :-)  She's
so cute!</p>

<p>I showered and got all the dirt down the drain to keep the bed clean.</p>
