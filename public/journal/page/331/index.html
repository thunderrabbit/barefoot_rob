<p>Chillin' with Satoko in Freshness Burger over some shakes and a
donut; yammerin' about randomness and laughing at my erroneous
Japanese.  She looked at my speech a little bit.</p>

<p>Satoko says, "HI.  I don't like that kind of song.  I like this
place but the music drives me crazy." (actually I wrote most of
that)</p>

<p>"nuts, almonds. I can't eat. Maybe that's reason I don't like."</p>

                        <p class=date>8:35am JST Monday 8 September 2003</p>

<p>Today is my six month evaluation.</p>

<p class=dream>I got to work and couldn't find the files for any of my
students.  I told Jon and he didn't care/help, but told me I should be
able to find them.   The system for filing files had been changed for
the worse; there was no drop box; it had been moved into a drop pile
with no concept of sorting involved.</p>

<p class=dream>The bell rang, and I was like, "oh and I *am* naked; I
thought I was only dreaming that I was naked."  Sure enough; I only
had on a shirt.  But no one cared so I didn't care, but I still didn't
have the files and didn't have a lesson planned.   I spent countless
precious minutes looking for a lesson in the level 4 book with which
I'd be comfortable doing a lesson, but they were all different;
somehow I couldn't remember doing *any* of them.</p>

<p>So glad to wake up.</p>

<p class=date>12:10pm</p>

<p>Just now walked with Matty to the train station.  Talked about
upcoming plans with janette and my evaluation.</p>

<p>He's planning to take *all* his vacation days at the end of his
Nova career: "I'm gonna do all the things that everyone has been doing
all in one go like.   I'll put all the ideas together everything that
everyone has learned and just do it."</p>

<p>As I got on my train he was all, "good luck with your interview.  I
hope you wear clothes!"</p>

<p>- = - = - = -</p>

<p>I did fine (my opinion), including reading a section from the book
as we're supposed to.  I told the students "please read from ... (here
to here)" oops; I had read from the teacher's portion of the book;
they didn't have the text in their books.  So I had them crowd around
and read from my book.</p>

<p>Classic.</p>

<p>After work I went out with Miki and Kaori.  Dinner and drinks (OJ
for me kurasai) and yammerin' in English and Japanese.  Quite fun.
Kaori kept calling me Bill (cause that's who they usually go out with
(I think!)).  I ate five fried fish.  Miki was quite quiet until the
latter half of the evening.  I dunno why.</p>

<p>I told them that I hated Nova (though I love the students, and
really want to help them (if they will put forth some effort)), and
that Nova is good for students who won't initiate and for teachers who
cannot teach.</p>

<p>Got a complaint from a student that I wasn't prepared for a lesson
a couple days ago.  (Takes a while for the complaint to filter through
the layers) What I remember: it was a level four lesson and I couldn't
find Ima's file.  Steve couldn't find Ima's file (and Steve is usually
a file magnet).  Because I couldn't find the file (and spent up to the
last minute looking for it), I didn't plan a lesson.  Because they
were level 4's, I assume two things:</p>

<p>1) Any level 4 lesson in the book is dumb.</p>

<p>2) They should be able to get along without a lesson.</p>

<p>But, they couldn't handle actually talking without structure so I
flipped through their files and turned to the book </p>

<p>Man fuck this; i'm not defending myself against air.  I </p>

<p>I got a page from Cory who wondered where I was; I had gone down to
the trains with Stephanie and didn't wait for him.  Got off at Yakko
and waited five minutes until his train came through.</p>
