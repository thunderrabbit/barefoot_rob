                        <p><p class=date>7:17 pm Monday 30 October 2000</p>

<p><p>Wow.</p>

<p><p>This may get graphic violent.</p>

<p><p>I vented at my I-Group about my pissed off anger at one guy at work who
writes stupid ass code and it all came down to me recognizing that he won&rsquo;t
accept my help when I offer.</p>

<p><p>In I-group a man asked when was the first time I had this feeling of
someone not accepting my offer for help.</p>

<p><p>I rolled back memories in my mind, back back.  faces houses events
rolling through my memories.  Work?  no.  Telecheck?  no.  my brother?  no.
My mo?  no.  My dad?  no.</p>

<p><p>3 years old?  no.  hmm
<br>2 years old?  pre school age?  before memory age?
<br>no no no</p>

<p><p>Suddenly a jeep or cart and a big gun and military war scene around me.
My best friend behind the gun loading it incorrectly.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing it
wrong,&rdquo; I said.  &ldquo;wait.  wait let me help.&rdquo; and fucking
BLAAAAaaaaaaaammmmm!!</p>

<p><p>it fucking discharged backwards and ripped through his body he was
fucking in two pieces on the ground his fucking legs and his body split
apart at the gut and he was still fucking alive but we fucking couldn&rsquo;t help
him. I couldn&rsquo;t help him any more and we had to fucking kill him put him out
of his misery godaamfuckin shit he wouldn&rsquo;t accept my help and he&rsquo;s dead.</p>

<p><p>In I-Group, huge sobbing tears and sadness gasping for breath as I&rsquo;m
reliving this scene.  He was dead in my mind and I was gasping stomach
clenched tightly trying to breathe in gasps and zillions of tingling tingles
all over my body of the feeling that I&rsquo;m onto something big and amazing real
life stuff.</p>

<p><p>wow.  that was the biggest stretch and work I&rsquo;ve done in I-group.  I
explaiined to them that I have never been in the military this lifetime.
and I don&rsquo;t know how they would react or how they believe or what.  but I
saw it.  I believe.  I feel better.</p>

<p><p>So I needed to hear that it wasn&rsquo;t my fault.  I can&rsquo;t control other
peoples&rsquo; acceptance of my help.  I offer help and they can accept or not.
Each individual is on his or her own path.  I can only offer help.  I cannot
force people to accept my help.</p>

                        <p><p class=date>10:01 am Sunday 29 October 2000</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;re leaving.  Cleanup went pretty smoothly.  Several people were
hanging out at the front of the church - mostly OKC peeps with all variety
of inside jokes about chillin&rsquo; in OKC, Amanda&rsquo;s pet iguana Floyd, and
Annie&rsquo;s dad answering the phone in a most entertaining manner,  without
trying to be entertaining.</p>

<p><p>Then waited in line for some munchies - donuts and cereal and milk and
orange juice.  We talked including &ldquo;I know a song that gets on everybody&rsquo;s
nerves&rdquo; and  &lsquo;Up In Heah up in heah&rsquo; by DMX and played hackey sack while in
line.</p>

<p><p>Then closing circle:  Yogi Bear led by Shira, Elizabeth and Hillary, then
Boogaloo led by Laura and Shira, and then I was invited to lead Aristasha,
then Debuh helped lead Three Chartreuse Buzzards.</p>

<p><p>Mugbooks and lots of hugs and hugs and hugs and confirmations of
correctness of email addresses in the mugbook, and hugs and hugs.</p>

<p><p class=date>10:13 am</p>

<p><p>Now there is a guy in a pickup truck laying on the horn as our caravan
turns into IHOP parking lot.  He sped past when he could. looking back and
hand on the horn.  Christina took the opportunity to yell at him.  Now we
are at IHOP, and there is a wait so we might not nope..  we&rsquo;re not staying.</p>

<p><p>I wonder how this will work; we have an extra person and one of our
people is missing.  Hmm.</p>

<p><p class=date>10:18 am</p>

<p><p>Now we are at Denny&rsquo;s parking lot.</p>

<p><p class=date>10:20 am</p>

<p><p>This was our final rally goodbye spot.  Youth have chosen to say goodbye
here.  We traded back Austin and now are on our way in search of food from
somewhere else.</p>

<p><p class=date>11:24 am</p>

<p><p>We just ate at Wendy&rsquo;s.  No line.  Aw yeah.</p>

<p><p>I listened to Cassie, Susie, Meg, Katy describe funny class stories and
the horror of their lunch schedules.</p>

<p><p class=date>11:31 am</p>

<p><p>getting into the van at the gas station, I barely lost my balance and
grabbed the shoulder strap seat belt to support me.  As it lengthened I was
all &ldquo;oh shit&rdquo; and  it simply extended several feet until I stepped back onto
the ground, knocking Wende backwards.  She didn&rsquo;t say anything so I didn&rsquo;t
say anything and just got in.</p>

<p><p>Turns out Wende didn&rsquo;t say anything because I knocked the wind out of
her.  Woah.  I gave her a hug.  It was pretty funny, really.</p>

<p><p class=date>11:36 am</p>

<p><p>I just changed the batteries in this thing. Special thanks to Susie for
getting them for me.  :-)</p>

<p><p>Chandra and Sara are sleepin&rsquo; in the back seat beside me.  Alison and
David are asleep in the next seat beside Katherine who is writing something
with pink highlighter.  Katy is asleep in the next seat beside Susie and
Cassie.  Amy is asleep beside Mark and Meg in the next seat.  Suse is
driving and talking to Wende in the passenger seat.</p>

<p><p>I will now spend some minutes seeing if I can recreate the alarm
non-auto-shutoff error.</p>

<p><p class=date>11:45 am</p>

<p><p>Oops lemme try again.</p>

<p><p class=date>11:47 am</p>

<p><p>Good news and bad news:</p>

<p><p>Bad: I didn&rsquo;t recreate the error</p>

<p><p>Good: I counted 60 seconds in my head to within .5 seconds of the Visor&rsquo;s
clock.</p>

<p><p class=date>11:58 am</p>

<p><p>Tried a couple of times; I&rsquo;m too tired to necessarily stay awake.</p>

<p><p>Add Katherine, Cassie, Susie and me to the sleeping list.</p>

                        <p><p class=date>7:56 am Saturday 28 October 2000</p>

<p><p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>at the really and went to call my mom and instead she asked
if she ocould talk to kT or asked if she could send kT a message through me
and then she wanted to just talk to kT.    I felt a bit dissed,  but was
all, yeah I can go get her.</p>

<p><p class=dream>&ldquo;maybe you can just go listen for her&rdquo; said my mom.</p>

<p><p class=dream>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll go find her.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>There was a lot more before this in the dream but I don&rsquo;t remember.</p>

<p><p class=date>9:09 am</p>

<p><p>Austin, <em>mesmerized</em> by the keyboard in his sleep deprived state,
opened the keyboard slowly, tried to click the Visor into place.</p>

<p><p>I clicked it into place and started typing.  &ldquo;That thing works??&rdquo; he
exclaimed.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hey do you have a mouse that goes with that?&rdquo; he asks now.</p>

<p><p>Bryn is still on the phone and I talked to her just after I wrote my
dream entry.  Now Nathan is talking to her.  It&rsquo;s now 12:13 am tomorrow
where she is.  It&rsquo;s time to play Silent Football at Bryn&rsquo;s house!!!</p>

<p><p>breakfast was yummy Art-cooked pancakes.   Oh!  That reminds me the
reason I&rsquo;m writing.  Austin walked up.  &ldquo;Can I have some pancakes?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;there are no pancakes,&rdquo; I told him.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, I see them right there.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;There are no pancakes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>He finally got a pancake and then grabbed a nearby coke can.  &ldquo;Is this
syrup?&rdquo;  and he poured a bit of coke on his pancakes.</p>

<p><p class=date>9:21 am</p>

<p><p>Austin just spoke with Bryn and hung up with her.</p>

<p><p>I signed Tanner&rsquo;s jumpsuit&rsquo;s butt for Bryn: &ldquo;HI From down under  SMILE!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>10:31 am</p>

<p><p>Fucking fucking shit!!!  I had an alarm set on my visor and it went off
but didn&rsquo;t auto-power-off after one minute.  Now the batteries are all low
and shit.  I&rsquo;m only pissed about it because I&rsquo;m a programer and <em>my</em>
program would fucking work and turn the shit off!!  I&rsquo;m doubly pissed at it
because I haven&rsquo;t been able to recreate the not-turn-off error to tell
handspring when it happens.  Piss.</p>

<p><p>Anyway, a bunch of people were at the tie dye workshop, dyeing shirts,
socks, bras, shorts, and anything white.  Sean and I were all helpfully
teasing each other when Wende was all, &ldquo;um, be careful not to get dye on
your [new] shorts, and I got dye on my shorts.  Oops. So I came up to
change.  I hope it comes out.  Wende says it won&rsquo;t.</p>

<p><p>Before the tie dye workshop we were playing hacky sack and having all
variety of fun, making Kung Fu noises with each kick.  At least Nathan and
Sean and I were.  The rest of the group just played.  We talked funny movie
stuff like the Matrix cause I leaned back and the bag went just over my
shoulder like slow bullets over Neo.   Nice.</p>

<p><p class=date>11:38 am</p>

<p><p>We just played fuckaround frisbee.  As opposed to ultimate frisbee, with
rules and stuff, we were just tossing it around.  Fun stuff.  Lots of wind.
Bibbster and Mattboy competed for the disc several times.  If someone caught
it, usually it was Matt.  Sean got it once or twice, but most often they
dropped it.</p>

<p><p class=date>12:39 pm</p>

<p><p>We are convening for the YAC meeting.  We grabbed sandwiches from the
lunch line and when I got to the couch, I realized I had forgotten to get
mayonnaise.  &ldquo;Karen, will you get me a packet of mayonnaise?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;  as she was leaving the room.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wow&rdquo; I said to Russ, I didn&rsquo;t expect her to say yes.</p>

<p><p>Karen came back, &ldquo;they didn&rsquo;t have packets, so I got you a napkin full.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wow.  You are the best, Karen.  Absolutely great.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I smeared the dollop of mayo on my sandwich, even though Sean and I
aren&rsquo;t sure that dollops are legal in Texas.  Once I smeared the napkin
mostly clean, I wadded it up and tossed it onto the table.</p>

<p><p>The napkin perfectly bounced and landed on Austin&rsquo;s plate, right in the
bite taken out of his sandwich.</p>

<p><p>Laura grabbed it out of the plate.</p>

<p><p>Sean&rsquo;s all, &ldquo;no leave it!  He couldn&rsquo;t do that again if he tried.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Give it to me.&rdquo;  I have a feeling about this.</p>

<p><p>Laura tossed the napkin to me and I tossed it again.  It perfectly
bounced onto the table and right onto Austin&rsquo;s plate by the bite in his
sandwich.</p>

<p><p>Awww yeah.  Sean conceded and gave me 5.</p>

<p><p>Austin came back.  &ldquo;First of all, what is this?  and why is it on my
plate?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You missed it.  You&rsquo;ll read all about it on Rob&rsquo;s website!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>True.</p>

<p><p class=date>12:47 pm</p>

<p><p>YAC meeting begins without Elizabeth.</p>

<p><p class=date>1:50 pm</p>

<p><p>We have been discussing selection of SWUUSI staff.  Not
<em>selecting</em> SWUUSI staff, but just discussing selection of SWUUSI
staff.</p>

<p><p class=date>2:09 pm</p>

<p><p>According to Austin, during his notes from the board meeting, Two twenty
dollar bills weighs .062 ounces.</p>

<p><p>A Bic lighter that&rsquo;s half full weighs .674 ounces</p>

<p><p class=date>3:45 pm</p>

<p><p>Still YAC meeting.  Talked about Jahnny Depp and fundraising and smoking
policy and Social Action Conference.</p>

<p><p class=date>6:27 pm</p>

<p><p>YAC meeting ended at 4:30pm; then I listened to the anti racisim workshop
given by someone from Anytown USA.</p>

<p><p>I chilled with Amanda on the couch for a second then Christina and Amanda
went to go put flowers in Amanda&rsquo;s hair.  It sounded too suspiciously like,
&ldquo;let&rsquo;s go smoke&rdquo; to me, so I asked Lilly (Amanda&rsquo;s friend) to go find them.
She did so and I have seen Lilly since then, but I don&rsquo;t know what was
discovered.</p>

<p><p>Now Lacy, Aaron, Sarah, Chandra, Kevin, and Mandy and I are playing I
Spy.</p>

<p><p>Joan and Annie just walked up; Annie exclaimed that she has never seen
this computer thing before.  Now they are saying that I&rsquo;m looking around but
actually writing and now I&rsquo;m going to write that they are saying I&rsquo;m going
to write something about them saying that I&rsquo;m going to write something about
them saying that I&rsquo;m going to write something about them saying something
about me writing.</p>

<p><p class=date>6:42 pm</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I infer something red.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Annie: &ldquo;The red light absorbed by the green grass.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>me: &ldquo;Yes!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>7:56 pm</p>

<p><p>I might have found the pattern of when this does not turn off after an
alarm is triggered.  It just did it again (special thanks to Susie for
getting AAA batteries for me)  It just stayed on again and the Memo screen
(where I type my journal entries) was active. Maybe that&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p><p class=date>7:59 pm</p>

<p><p>Anyway, the reason I&rsquo;m writing:  Wende and I talked about the possiblity
of her being the CoCo with Debo for SWUUSI and I think she may choose to do
it.</p>

<p><p>Now the YAC is addressing all the youth about the stuff YAC discussed in
the YAC meeting..  Oh my gosh!!  This is so funny: Karen is consulting notes
written on her forearm.  hahahaha</p>

<p><p class=message>This is the coolest computer in the world.</p>

<p><p class=date>8:17 pm</p>

<p><p>YAC elections were so fast!!  Only 3 people were to be elected and only 3
people ran.</p>

<p><p>Sara and I just wrote our song for talent show.  I&rsquo;ll type it at some
point.</p>

<p><p>Laura did a great job on the Continental Awareness workshop.</p>

<p><p>I walked into a discussion between Wende, Ty, Debeaux, maybe Steve from
Shreveport, and Karen, talking about prisons, schools (and their similarity
to prisons), death penalty, etc.</p>

<p><p>Laura walked up and Wende was all, &ldquo;Rob!  Doesn&rsquo;t Laura look like _____
from the movie <em>Long Kiss Goodnight</em>?</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Um&hellip; no.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Picture her breaking the neck of a deer!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Laura gave a bright smile and twisted her hands in a deer neck breaking
motion.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Nope.  I still don&rsquo;t see it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>9:30 pm</p>

<p><p>Debi stuck her finger through the bottom of a plastic film canister thing
and effectively got her finger stuck.  hahaha  that&rsquo;s pretty funny.  I
helped her get her finger out.</p>

<p><p>Deba, Wende, Nancy, Ty, Laura all planning what we would do in Ty&rsquo;s
Intentional Community.  Wende will help organize horticulture therapy and
Laura will be the deerslayer, and Ty will be the one who decides who gets to
be part of the Community.</p>

<p><p class=date>10:22 pm</p>

<p><p>We may live in yurts at Ty&rsquo;s Intentional Community.  Nick, Annie and I

<p><p class=date>11:35 pm</p>

<p><p>Worship consists of burning little scraps of super fast burning paper
with negative feeelings written on them after a mock demonstration of
hatred.</p>

<p><p>Karl flipped his up into the air.  Sean and I were all aw yeah.</p>

<p><p class=date>12:24 am</p>

<p><p>Before the talent show, Nick and I just got some big boxes of Nerds.  We
drove to HEB and I pulled my sweatpants legs over my feet so I wasn&rsquo;t
precisely barefoot.  Aw yeah.</p>

<p><p class=date>12:34 am</p>

<p><p>Talent show</p>

<p><p>David and Joan just did some fantastic swing stuff, including some wacky
&ldquo;pretzle&rdquo; twists andsome killa flying htings kinda.  Shoulda been there.</p>

<p><p>Robby just did some human tricks, including pushups, and then clap
pushups,  &ldquo;can you clap behind your back?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>He obediently clapped behind his back and <em>thump</em> landed flat on
the carpet.</p>

<p><p>Shira then did a totally awesome 1 person skit with 4 characters all
distinct in their mannerisms and voices and all their parts mixed up quickly
together.  She consulted her notes a few times but it was still fly.</p>

<p><p>When she forgot a line: &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the idiot now, mamma?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>After Shira&rsquo;s performance, Nick and I began ours.  The goal: to each eat
a 7 oz box of nerds.  Box and all.  After we started, Steve F played &ldquo;Rocky
Raccoon&rdquo; and something else on guitar as Nick and I sat on the corner of the
stage like a small window on the corner of a TV.</p>

<p><p class=date>1:03 am</p>

<p><p>Nick and I are in the nidst of eating a 7 oz box of Nerds each, including
the box as Grantly is dressed beautifully in drag, dancing and collecting
dollar bills.</p>

<p><p class=date>1:18 am</p>

<p><p>Amidst a peanut butter phuuf on Seth, who just gave his literary resume&rsquo;,
Nick and I are calling it a draw.</p>

<p><p class=date>1:37 am</p>

<p><p>Sara and I just sang our song that gets on everybodys nerves.</p>

<p><p>Very nice.  Super great congratulations to Sara for getting up on stage
at her first rally!</p>

<p><p>Karl just did a card trick.</p>

<p><p class=date>1:55 am</p>

<p><p>Ryan just did a set of cool card tricks, mixing and matching 8 cards.</p>

<p><p class=date>1:57 am</p>

<p><p>Aaron is playing some super fly piano piece that he wrote.</p>

<p><p class=date>1:03 am (including 1 hour back)</p>

<p><p>Sean is writing in the fourth rally book.  It has black thick paperboard
covers.</p>

<p><p>I almost spilled Laura&rsquo;s groovie juice on the carpet and my sleeping bag.</p>

<p><p>Frank and Gene made the Grooovey Juice tonight.  It tastes like a tea
base with lots of sugar and Nerds.</p>

<p><p class=date>3:33 am</p>

<p><p>Silent Football is turning into a funny funfest as Phat Pat is prompting
Mr Fwopping (formerly known as Mr Cole) in the song Little Bunny Foo Foo.</p>

<p><p>So funny: Mr Fwopping heard &ldquo;dunking the good fairy&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;down
came the good fairy&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>hahahahhahahahahahahahahahah!!!</p>

<p><p>Mr Smoochy has 4.99 penance points</p>

<p><p>Mr Pat said something like I would like to say to Mr Fwopping &ldquo;belss you&rdquo;
and then Mr Pat rephrased it to Mr Pat would like Mr Fwopping to be blessed.</p>

<p><p class=date>4:09 am  Now we are playing Mafia with Ryan as narrator</p>

<p><p class=date>4:21 am</p>

<p><p>I just got picked off by The Mafia in Mafia.   I was the first to go.
They musta thouht I was too big of a threat.  Muwahahahahahaaha!!!!</p>

<p><p>I think that Sean and Aaron are Mafia. I don&rsquo;t have a third guess.</p>

<p><p class=date>4:24 am</p>

<p><p>I was close.  Sean and Chelsea are Mafia.  Chelsea is next to Aaron, and
I thought he was mafia because Ryan&rsquo;s voice pointed that direction when he
was talking.</p>

<p><p>Daniel said, &ldquo;are you quoting me?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>4:59 am</p>

<p><p>I was Commissioner in the most recent game of mafia.  I guessed Pat
(correct) and Sam (correct) And hopefully I gave them away.  But the mafia
killed me.</p>

<p><p class=date>5:07 am</p>

<p><p>Townspeople won this last game.  Looks like most people are going to
sleep.</p>

<p><p class=date>5:12 am</p>

<p><p>Pretty much everything is quiet except for maybe two conversations and
some wandering people, who are probably looking for that last fix of fun
before cleanup, or for a nice place to quickly sleep.</p>

<p><p>So I was commissioner in the last game of mafia, but I&rsquo;m not really clear
on the best way to reveal what I know to the townsfolk without the mafia
knowing who is the commissioner.</p>

<p><p>Ah well.  Maybe later I will see a great commissioner in action.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m pretty much awake now and could play more games, including Silent
Football, but I know that sleep will overwhelm me quickly as soon as I lay
down.</p>

                        <p><title>Dream: staples and KTRU</title>
<p class=date>6:21am CDT Friday 27 October 2000
<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>I had some injury on my back and in order to play a
record a KTRU, I had to staple my back with a stapler.  I was in the
station and my shift was about to start in 10 minutes.    I wanted to
practice to see if I could correctly do the staple thing and I reached
over my own shoulder and <em>whap</em> with the stapler a staple into
my back.  The record played correctly, but I had to get the staple
out.  I had whapped it in all the way flush with my skin.</p>

<p><p class=dream>We were at work and Kasi had just asked Karla if Karla
could help Kasi with something this weekend, and Karla said no.  Then
I asked Karla if she could do surgery on my back.  I showed her the
staple and she used her fingernails to pry it out, but it wouldn&rsquo;t
come out easily; it was lodged between my ribs.  We both braced
ourselves and she pulled and got it part way out.</p>

<p><p class=dream>We finally got it out (or didn&rsquo;t) and the scene shifted
a bit so that we were watching the video of the current KTRU song
being played.  The video showed multiple clips of a woman diving off a
rock into a lake.  The first time she dove in. The second time, she
jumped in feet first.  Each time she was wearing a big long pleated
skirt and stretchy fabric top.  Each time before she jumped into the
lake, the skirt and top were dry.</p>

<p>I cannot see as I&rsquo;m typing here.  I hope everything is flowing from my
brain through my fingers as I intend.
<p>We are en route to San Antonio Rally now.  fifteen passenger van and I
know the names of all but one youth in here whose name I forgot.  I have
known it.
<p>Okay, we have Susie driving and Wende shotgun.  Bench seats: David, Amy,
Susie, Cassie, Katherine, Mark, Meg, Chandra, Hethre, Alison, Katy, Sara,
and me.
<p>I was asked to tell one  of my classic jokes.  I told a one hour
rendition of Moe and Joe, including Flo, the brilliant scientist who
genetically engineerd Moe and Joe, Mike and Ike who were genetically
designed jockeys to ride Moe and Joe, and race after race with Moe winning,
and then Moe and Joe racing independently, including Joe racing jet planes
on a ring of 200 rented aircraft carriers.  Then Moe winning again until
they retire on an island with the dog.
<p>Then we played the 7 Game for a while, and now they are playing a game I
haven&rsquo;t previously heard.. &ldquo;I give you back your nose&hellip;&rdquo;  hmm.. I&rsquo;ll
listen.
<p class=date>9:18 pm
<p>We stopped at Love&rsquo;s and Subway.  Hethre is diggin through the 3/$9.99
CDs.</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;ve arrived.  Steve reminded me of my mugbook quote:  &ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;m sorry;
did I break your concentration?&rdquo;  For almost every rally I&rsquo;ve attended, my
quotes come from that movie.</p>

<p><p>Already I&rsquo;ve sung &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve never closed your eyes&hellip;&rdquo; with Ryan, recreated
the WHASSSSAAAAAAAAAAAPPP commercial with Daniel, and read through the
wonderfilled Yackity Yak..  Now it&rsquo;s time to learn more names.</p>

<p><p class=date>12:02 am</p>

<p><p>Talkin talkin to Lisa, Laura, Andrew, Elizabeth&hellip;</p>

<p><p class=date>12:28 am</p>

<p><p>Talkin&rsquo; to Deirdre and Wende.  Haven&rsquo;t seen Deirdre since last San
Antonio rally!!  She says she quit her old job and now she travels more.</p>

<p><p>Dueling music in the loud room - Smashing Pumpkins blasting on one side
and the piano being pounded masterfully by Nick on the other side.</p>

<p><p>Someone getting phuufed by Daniel and others.</p>

<p><p class=date>12:36 am</p>

<p><p>Elizabeth reminds me that I was all, &ldquo;what rally?&rdquo; today on AIM (&ldquo;WHICH
WAS MEAN!  write that in.&ldquo;).  It went something like this:</p>

<p><p><font color="#0000FF"><b>Liz</b></font>: &ldquo;Am I going to see you and Wende
tonight??&rdquo;
<br><font color="#FF0000"><b>Rob</b></font>: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re coming to Houston?&rdquo;
<br><font color="#0000FF"><b>Liz</b></font>: &ldquo;What?  no the rally.&rdquo;
<br><font color="#FF0000"><b>Rob</b></font>: &ldquo;What rally?&rdquo;
<br><font color="#0000FF"><b>Liz</b></font>: &ldquo;San An rally, silly&rdquo;
<br><font color="#FF0000"><b>Rob</b></font>: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s this weekend?&rdquo;
<br><font color="#0000FF"><b>Liz</b></font>: &ldquo;What?  yes!&rdquo;
<br><font color="#FF0000"><b>Rob</b></font>: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m busy.&rdquo;
<br><font color="#0000FF"><b>Liz</b></font>: &ldquo;WHat????&rdquo;
<br><font color="#FF0000"><b>Rob</b></font>: &ldquo;yeah I&rsquo;ll be there.  just
kiddin&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>12:42 am</p>

<p><p>Sean, I mean Mr The Bibbster just walked up wearing a grey beret.
His hair is not bleached.</p>

<p><p class=date>12:52 am</p>

<p><p>Nathan just walked in with wack hat, pants, shirt and hair!!</p>

<p><p class=date>12:58 am</p>

<p><p>Just met Laura and Amanda, sisters from Ft Worth.  Just relearned Jared&rsquo;s
name.</p>

<p><p class=date>1:13 am</p>

<p><p>Nathan is having hacky sack withdrawls.</p>

<p><p class=message>Hello, I&rsquo;m Amanda. This is my first rally.</p>

<p><p class=date>1:33 am</p>

<p><p>Elizabeth is cracking up telling the story about how Sean ate soap.  Sean
exclaims &ldquo;I thought it was safe, and it wasn&rsquo;t safe at all.
Aaaauuaghhg!!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>2:47 am</p>

<p><p>Opening circle was pretty informative and now youth are being sent to
their touchgroups one group at a time.</p>

<p><p>Susie (advisor) and I are making silly comments.  Susie is fun.</p>

<p><p class=date>3:33 am</p>

<p><p>Robby is watching me type. Our touchgroup meeting was awesome; we asked
questions and then everyone answered them.  What is the most embarassing
thing you&rsquo;ve done, after my question What is the worst CD in your
collection, which is actually the question that Hillary used to introduce
the game I think.</p>

<p><p>OKC youth just arrived.  They musta been packed into that van.  Marcus,
Lilly, Amanda, Tori, Lisa, Whitney, Josh, Fran, Austin, Amber, Hannah&hellip;  Oh
and Debu and Nancy the advisors.</p>

<p><p>Crowds are dispersing into little groups; the big band swing is quietly
in the background with David and Joan doing swing dance tricks on stage.
People chillin&rsquo; on the couch watching, and Lacy watching from across the
room.  Laura B with a small crowd around her as she deals Las Vegas style Go
Fish.  That&rsquo;s so funny!!</p>

<p><p class=date>3:39 am</p>

<p><p>Robby just bought me a bag of Reese&rsquo;s Pieces and that rules.  Robby is
like a little bag of happy energy.</p>

<p><p class=date>4:25 am</p>

<p><p>Lilly and Amanda and Katie were all getting dressed to the max actually
Katie was just watching.  They were being loud by the advisor area.</p>

<p><p>12 walk-ins.  I&rsquo;m very anti-impresssed.  I think YAC will talk about it.</p>

<p><p>I read some National Geograhic - some of the issue on water.  until my
eyes were all bluh falling asleep.  Now I&rsquo;m in advisor sleeping area about
to sleep.</p>

<p><p>Good night.</p>

<p><p>I just added entries 21jason.html through 24dana.html</p>

<p><p>Work today consisted of a lot of little projects and 1 big thing of
moving the Ritz project online for actual production on Monday.</p>

<p><p>The little projects consisted of
<ul>
<li>negotiating our new T1 line that will be installed in January,
<li>negotiating how to get Ryan M, Nicole M and her two sisters, and Amy C
all set up for the rally tonight.  They hadn&rsquo;t turned in their forms or
anything.  I think it will be all good.
<li>moving my Handspring Visor entries online.
</ul></p>

<p><p>I think there was something else, but I&rsquo;ve forgotten.  Mostly it was the
Ritz project.  Couple of final changes and it&rsquo;s online.  Nice.</p>

<p><p>San Antonio Rally tonight!!!!  I&rsquo;m late.  barely.</p>

<p class=date>7:23am CDT Thursday 26 October 2000
<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>Wende and I were at a Walgreen&rsquo;s type store with Dude,
who was talking on his cell phone.  I motioned to Dude that it was
time to leave and I looked over to see if Wende was ready.  She had
asked about the location of the CD by Massive Attack.  She was on a
highway construction site and driving the big bulldozer to dump some
dirt on the edge of a roadbed so she could get the CD.  I was all
impressed watching her and then she was driving the bulldozer backward
in an effort to dump or shake the dirt out the front and she slid off
the dozer onto the dirt!  She sat there with a pouty face while the
dozer was slowly still driving backwards.  I was all yipes!  and I was
driving a different bulldozer thing backwards and had to make mine go
forward or at least stop before I could help her go catch hers.  My
bulldozer was about to drive backwards into a busy 6 lane street.  I
reached behind my back where the controls were on the bulldozer and
was randomly flipping switches, just trying to make it turn off and I
got it to stop and it was just too scary and I woke myself up.</p>

<p class=date>12:34am CDT Friday 27 October 2000</p>

<p><p>A grand game of ultimate - we played for almost 3 hours I believe.
Kat, my favorite, was there.  She was in a super happy bouncy hyper
mood!!  Derrick (sp) played; he&rsquo;s about 11 or 13 years old and lives
in the neighborhood.  He rode piggyback on me a few times, and we
played a don&rsquo;t-move-your-feet game.</p>

<p><p>After ultimate, I helped Wende a little by cleaning the shower and
bathtub.  She shaved my head with the buzzer clippers, and I shaved it
all the way with a disposable razor.  I&rsquo;m bald!  I remind myself of
Neo on <em>The Matrix</em>.  Except I have eyebrows.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Tomorrow&rdquo; begins San Antonio Rally for the weekend!!  I super-hope
to get all this past weekend transferred to my site before we go and I
end up with 2 weekends to transfer!</p>
