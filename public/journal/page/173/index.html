<p>So anyway, I set up Lin&rsquo;s MOOV device on her phone, and I just tweeted
to the MOOV team that I&rsquo;ll likely buy a new phone so I can use my MOOV
device.</p>

<p>Turns out, I should just be able to switch my SIM card to new phone
and not even tell my provider, so I can keep my unlimited data plan.</p>

<p>Okay, so I just received in the mail my <a href="https://welcome.moov.cc/">MOOV</a>, a movement tracking device which
can connect to my phone via BLE, Bluetooth Low Energy.  Nice.</p>

<p>All excited to set it up, I see the app requires iOS 8.</p>

<p>Now, I&rsquo;ve resisted many a fancy app which has had this requirement.  I
don&rsquo;t want to cripple my iPhone 4S with an &ldquo;upgrade&rdquo; to the OS which I
don&rsquo;t really need.</p>

<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/09/ios-9-on-the-iphone-4s-a-stay-of-execution-nothing-more/">https://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/09/ios-9-on-the-iphone-4s-a-stay-of-execution-nothing-more/</a></p>

<p>The above article title doesn&rsquo;t sound good for iOS 9, but at the end
they&rsquo;re like &ldquo;bah might as well do it&rdquo; (my paraphrase)</p>

<p>So I clicked the fancy Install Now link on my phone.</p>

<p>I see the password dialog, anddddd can&rsquo;t paste my password into it.</p>

<p>Fuck you, Apple.  Fuck you if you think this in any way is a smart
design decision.  Basically you want me to have a shitty password so
that I can type it here?  I can&rsquo;t use my password
E4&rsquo;h&lt;v,ei7\,R!nwo/e-&lsquo;W9gvYG;P% very easily now can I?  You think I&rsquo;m
going to type that shit in on your shitty keyboard?</p>

<p>This is like the 100th extra nail in the already decrepit coffin for
my relationship with Apple.</p>

<p>I want a divorce, all my money back, plus damages for pain and suffering.</p>

<h3 id="cause-anyway">cause anyway</h3>

<p>Is it not bad enough that I can only use 32 characters for my
password? I&rsquo;d love to know why they decided to add that crappy limitation.</p>

<p>But the weather was reasonably warm for the season.  Quite overcast,
though we saw the moon peek through a few times.</p>

<p>haha remember PEEK and POKE in BASIC?</p>

<p>Lance and I were just in the free massage chairs for around an hour
after we bathed in the 24 hour お風呂.  My massage chair inflated
balloons at various points, whereas I think his used rollers to
massage.</p>

<p>We talked about free energy, Kissinger and Vietnam, fiat currency,
Germany wanted its gold back (sorry charlie), JFK, 911, and a couple
others I forgot.</p>

<p>I walked to the lodge from Kiyosato station after inquiring at an info
desk near the taxi statnd.  I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t take a taxi; it&rsquo;s
straight down a hill with only a tiny little incline.</p>

<p>We are in 伊予ロッチ Iyo Lodge, the name of which reminds me of いいよ,
or &ldquo;sure thing&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anyway, I took a nice nap for nearly an hour upon arrival, and then
joined the group for a 20 minute meditation.  This time, my brain woke
up a lot after I started focusing on the intervals between my breaths,
trying to link them smoothly.  My consciousness was just like <em>ding</em>
and became very focused on the present, with very little blahblahblah
background chatter.</p>

<p>Dinner in five minutes and then get our futons ready for sleeping, and
then another meditation and <em>then</em> head out to the field to welcome friendly
contact from nearby extra terrestrial beings.</p>

<p>Last night I wanted to support Lin to help her relax after work.  I
know she wants the house to be tidy before going to bed, whereas idgaf
how messy it is.  I was like, &ldquo;can we talk tonight?&rdquo; and she goes, &ldquo;no
way I&rsquo;m tired&rdquo; because she thought I asked something else.  I
inexplicably go, &ldquo;okay but if you stay up cleaning everything I&rsquo;ll be
really angry,&rdquo; which right up there near the top of several lists of
things not to say at various times.</p>

<p>Fortunately we got it sorted pretty quickly; I realized what she
thought I asked, and explained I hadn&rsquo;t asked that.</p>

<p>TL;DR: I&rsquo;m an ass.</p>

last.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m on Nambu Line headed to Tachikawa, at which point I&rsquo;ll have about
20 minutes to get a ticket for the next train.  Hopefully the ticket
line will be shorter than in Kawasaki!</p>

<p>Nice.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m chillin&rsquo; at a conveni near my lesson in Akihabara.</p>

<p>I brought a new (small) shikishi to start a new drawing.  However,
when I pulled it out of my bag, I realized they only markers I have
are Posca, which I sorta kinda don&rsquo;t always like.  I like the ink, but
the nibs on these particular pens seems scratchy and don&rsquo;t always draw
nice lines.</p>

<p>So I decided to buy a brand new pen.  Whatever they had here at the
store&hellip; I figured I&rsquo;d end up with a fine line color pen, like a 0.3mm
pen&hellip; but the ones they have <em>might</em> be eraseable / some variety of
not waterproof, so I chose not to buy them.  They had some big fat
markers, but I&rsquo;ve got plenty &hellip; oh hooooo what&rsquo;s this??</p>

<p>Is that a white-out pen?  Holy cats it is.  Nice.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to start with white dots on my white paperboard.</p>

<p>Haha nice. Okay I&rsquo;ve got about 100 dots on the paperboard.  Had I
planned a bit, I might have left some, um, whitespace in the middle,
but for now it&rsquo;s on one corner.</p>
