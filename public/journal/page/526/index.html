<p>I'm particularly far behind in my writing, so I
will write an overview of stuff, and then maybe maybe
fill in some gaps on previous days.</p>

<p>As of right now, the most recent entry is
25today.html, so if any more appear between that entry
and this one, know they were written after this one. 
Oh, unless any are stored in my Handspring Visor.</p>

<p>Today, finally, finally I got to be primarily a
programmer.  The past few days at work had been
<em>sucking</em> due to all the project administrator
stuff I was having to do.  Super thanks to Patrick for
taking over a lot of that duty.  Super thanks to Karla
and my job in general for supporting the concept of
allowing people to do what they enjoy doing.</p>

<p>The current modification to G3 that I'm working on
will allow participants to go through the 360 feedback
process on their own individual timeline.  In a
general sense, this means that each person just has a
unique class number.  Easy enough, but it affects some
of the reporting - it has to be done by date, instead
of by class.</p>

<p>Also, I'm writing a new part of the sign-in process
that allows the user to choose their timeframe.  This
new screen I think will prove to be user friendly and
well-enjoyed.</p>

<p>And, we need to add a new report - one that allows
the user to see what timeline they are on.  Since they
are more in control of this, we might as well let them
see what they are working with.</p>

<p>But even that has some questions that go along with
it.  And some design considerations on how to make it
generalized so more than just one set of milestones
can be included in the reports.</p>

<p>Whatever.</p>

<p>- - - - -</p>

<p>Tonight Cynthia from our investment club came over
and we filled out two SSGs for two small or mid-cap
companies.  We think they look pretty good, but we'll
see how the rest of the peeps in the club do on their
stock search.</p>

<p>We may meet again tomorrow and fill out another, or
do more research on those we've completed so far.</p>

<p>- - - - -</p>

<p>Wende is at work until 10pm tonight.</p>

<p>I'm at Hobby airport now, waiting for Elise's
flight to arrive.  It should be here -1 minutes ago
accoding to my Visor's clock.</p>

<p>Today Laura and I visited for a bit and then I went
to YRUU.  There, Amy was stressed to the maxx as she
was trying to coordinate rides to Tulsa rally.  She
has done an excellent job, considering how hard it
seems to be to get people to give accurate and timely
information about whether they intend to attend or
not.</p>

<p>I know her stress and hopefully encouraged her with
a few encouraging words.  Helped her make a decision
to not feel responsible if people don't contact her
soon.</p>

<p>Then took a big ol' fat nap and got a call from
Maggie and John.  They came over for dinner at La
Jaliscience and John worked on installing software on
Wende's computer while Maggie and I watched The
Simpsons.</p>

<p>John helped me decide on a network topology for our
setup at home, so we can have all three computers
online at once, and have a firewall and good stuff
like that.  Seems that the Cable modem won't serve
more than 1 IP address at a time.</p>

<p>We gave them Wende's old computer so John can
install Free BSD on it and use it as a 2nd firewall
for their house.</p>

<p>Plane is here.  people getting off.</p>

<p>I'm gonna try to get the first part of the day
written before the rest of the day occurs.</p>

<p>Played ultimate today in the HURL (Houston Ultimate
Rec League) <a
href="https://www.strayconesports.com">strayconesports.com</a>.
 Fun game; I'm on the team called Fluff, The Final
Conflict.  This is Ahmet's (sp) 4th and last year to
captain the team called Fluff.</p>

<p>I didn't know what team I was supposed to be on, so
I arrived at 9am, the earliest possible time to play,
and ended up waiting (and writing letters) until
playtime at 10:30am.  It was actually a bit longer
cause I accidentally got there earlier than I
intended.  8:20 or so.</p>

<p>We won the game; I did some great defensive plays
against a pretty fast capable player. Fun stuff.</p>

<p>Then Dude and I took some pictures for <a
href="https://www.humanclock.com">humanclock dot
com</a>.  Laura watched, and was pretty entertained,
and quite helpful with ideas!  (Unicycle, for one)</p>

<p>I don't have the pics available online yet, but I
may do that sometime.  The timeslots we took were
11:50, 11:51, 11:52.  Tomorrow we intend to get some
underwater pics for 11:53 and up to 11:59.  I wonder
if our pics will be available tonight?</p>

<p>Now I'm going to go shower and change before peeps
arrive for our evening adventure to see "Ruthless" 
Yay!!</p>

<p>Such fun at "Ruthless"!!  We got to sit on the
front row!!  The coolest part about the front row came
when introducing the main character, Tina - she asks
someone in the front row, "How ya doin?"  and someone
else, "Where ya from?" to create how outgoing her
character is.  She looked right at me for "Where ya
from?"</p>

<p>I winked.  ...  After the show, she was all, "when I said 'Where ya
from?' I thought, 'Hey, I know where you're from!'"  So the amazing
thing is that she thought that, and I couldn't tell she had a hint of
recognition.  The show must go on.</p>

<p>I caught a few more of the jokes, and a few more of
the lines from the Unkey's Munkle song.</p>

<p>So amazed at how consistent and precisely the show
matched the first time I saw it.  Are these actresses
really <em>right there</em>?  How can that be?</p>

<p>I got a much greater appreciation for Tina's mother character.  But
Tina is still my favorite.</p>

<p>Rollercoaster of discontiguous stuff today!!</p>

<p>3 stories that are all part of my life:</p>

<p>1) Elise' needed a ride to the airport today.  My
great idea was that Laura could take her, cause Laura
is in town today with not a lot to do after her class.
 So while I was at work, I tried to get Elise's phone
number to Laura and/or Laura's phone number to Elise'
to see if that would work.</p>

<p>Around lunchtime, I got a call from Laura asking if
she was still the preferred taxi.  I called Wende who
said she was with Elise who was going to take the
hotel shuttle to the airport for $15.  I called Laura
back and said she was free to do whatever.</p>

<p>Heard back from Wende an hour later; the shuttle
did not leave every 1/2 hour, but every 1 hour, and
would not work.   D'oh!</p>

<p>I called Elise' a bit later to see how it turned
out, and she was with Laura, en route to the airport.
Awesome!</p>

<p>2) I was scheduled to be on a conference call for
1/2 hour, but it turned into a <em>2 hour</em>
conference call.  2 hours is not horrible, but 4 times
longer than expected took a significant chunk of time
outta my day.  But it was a good call and I think
we'll have a great project with these people.</p>

<p>3) I was scheduled to receive a master names list
from these guys yesterday.  Nothing.  Early this
morning?  nothing.   2pm.  Finally I get the list. 
Then when I start going through it there is all sorts
of crap bogus data.  So I send it back and asked it to
be cleaned up.  They got it mostly cleaned up, but
there are still some repeated names or very similar
names.  I'm going to find those (or ask Kevin) and
send them the repeats on Monday.   I don't think this
project is going to start on Monday as originally
hoped. Oh well.  Moral: "give me your data on
time!"</p>

<p>4) I spent several minutes watching <a
href="https://www.humanclock.com">www.humanclock.com</a>
 Dude and I are going to take pics tomorrow so we can
be featured on the site!</p>

<p>5) I'm going to the YRUU bridging ceremony now.</p>

<p>Today near the end of my time at work, while I was
getting some programming done, the pager beeped.  The
pager that should have been with Dave, but that he
left on his desk.  For some reason, the web server
checker thought the web server was down, and paged
911-911-911 on the pager.</p>

<p>The server is up and responding quickly.  I don't
know what the problem was.  However, I was being paged
consistently every 30 minutes.  Turns out there's a 30
minute server checker, and it will trigger every 30
minutes until it's reset.  Unfortunately, one has to
go in to work to reset it.</p>

<p>So I rode my bike to work to fix it.  I determined
that it's just a tad over 5 miles to work.  I think
that's correct.  I didn't specifically time it, but I
remember I turned over 130,000 miles in my car on my
way to work; I was almost there, and now I have
130,007 miles on my car.</p>

<p>I got to work in 13 minutes, according to Wende
timing me.  (I called her when I arrived).  That's
better than 20 miles per hour!</p>

<p>I left work and arrived back at the house in 11
minutes.  That's just about 30 miles per hour!!!</p>

<p>Wow wow wow.  So at some point I will more
carefully determine the mileage between home and work,
but for now, wow.  30 miles per hour on my bike seems
pretty awesomely fast.</p>

<p>Super duper thanks to Maggie tonight for trying to
get Wende's computer working.  Maggie wasn't able to
get it resuscitated.</p>

<p>Monday night was Kristen's birthday party at Dave
and Buster's.  Wende and I were at Spanish class and
did not attend.   In spanish, Rachel wasn't there, and
I didn't even notice until the instructor noticed she
was missing.</p>

<p>Yesterday at work I had a crappy 1 hour phone call
with one of our clients.  They want everything for
free, don't have a clue how anything works, think
everything is magic, and don't want to do
anything.</p>

<p>To be clear, that is a grand over simplification,
but after an hour of trying to explain without
becoming angry, using politically correct terminology,
that they are a bunch of morons, I just wanted to cry.
 So I did a little bit.</p>

<p>Also yesterday, I finished writing a new aspect of
the G3.  This piece allows us to view user feedback on
the process for any project it hosts.  *And* it allows
the administrator of a particular project to see user
feedback on the project.  One program fits in place in
two different sets of programs.  *That* is cool - it's
making SAS do something that looks like
encapsulization and object oriented stuff.  And let me
assure you, SAS is not object oriented.</p>

<p>Today I visit the dentist at 7:30am.  I'll get 3
fillings and a mouth guard for wearing at night so I
don't break my teeth when I'm sleeping.  Apparently I
grind my teeth at night.  Sometimes I can feel that my
jaw is sore in the morning, but otherwise I am unaware
of this activity.  But my teeth have grooves to prove
it, and Wende is a witness.</p>

Hey babes, yep, another addition of mes-amis street.
If anyone is really bored of getting these messages,
let me know, just a small note, no hard feelings,
these are just little thoughts about the journey, for
myself as well- kind of my journal. Historically i
have not been the most open person to share my
thoughts how they occur, but i aspire to be an open
book, my secrets are not that special. So Walla!
France is helping me out in that department, I had a
very fine 12 course dinner last night that must have
lasted for 4 hours after I attended the band practice
of my podiatrist (who invited me to stay at her and
her hubbies place after an office visit to check my
poor poor feet). We talked about sex and positions and
god, well, not so much about god but oh god! I thought
the french must start in jr. high in sex education
class to learn about love and pleasure and all that
good stuff the rest of the world blushes about. NO!
The dinner table!!! And when half of the day is spent
at the table, no wonder they know so much! I will
probably walk through Condom, France sometime soon,and
unfortunately they do not make condoms there anymore
or i would send ya'll a souvenir, the french condoms
are superior! 
There are some nice differences between the french
life and the american life. I really enjoy sitting at
the table and talking about everything, and enjoying
one dish at a time with such gusto that even the
ordinary seems extraordinary. Last night and many
other times we have spent hours singing at the table!
I am trying to incorporate some french songs into my
repertoire, so far just spanish, english, german and
ron taught me some really cool songs in dutch
including; "The garbage pile age", "I'm so glad... my
nose in the front and not on the side", "the big
mushroom song", "sesame street" in dutch and several
others of his own composition and other typical dutch
songs. I can always use a fresh tune! 
Other differences are that they don't have shower
curtains! Nope, you shower and if the water sprays all
over the room, you just don't have enough control. A
dear friend of mine who i would like to share a story
about later sent me an e-mail asking if it was true
that after the french go to the toilet if "they blow
the shit out of their ass"? Well, i have never
personally witnessed a french person do this, but i
know from my own family tradition that it is a good
idea, and it is a special pleasure i am sure
originated in france. In fact, i would advise anyone
to save up for a bidet, it is all all round tool that
i have seen used more to wash clothes in (in france)
than for hinney cleaning, so go ahead and take out the
sink if there is not enough room in the bathroom, it
also doubles as a fountain. One thing that is nicer in
the states, aside from the shower curtain thing is
nice hugs. Just kisses on the cheek here, and one hug
from a french guy immigrating to australia. Hug your
friends, and hug them for me too please. 
   That brings me to dreaming, i have had some intense
dreams and one that woke me up several nights ago was
about a girl i used to go to church with. She is all
grown up now and she and her brother even came to a
party and ate some of the road-kill rabbit i cooked up
a couple of years ago. When i was about 10 years old
(and she was 3) her 16 year old sister was killed by a
drunk driver. Maby it was my age, or Shannon's (the
girl who was killed) profound beauty,or her laugh, or
her joy and talents and potential or the realization
of how delicate and precious life is... but her death
changed my life. I guess i decided to profit from
life, and see and do it my way, just incase someone
plows through me later today. It is more than that
though, maby even not about the way i live, but the
way i want to live for those that can't because of
economic or physical conditions. I would like to take
a moment here to recognize those that have left us
because of fatal accidents, suicide, war, famine,
disease and the like. I know from personal experience
that sometimes the true resolve to live comes when you
are starring death in the face, and sometimes that is
too late. Cheers to the spirits around and within us
and to Shannons would-be 36th summer!!! I hope i am
living up to the inspirations that have motivated me. 

In french "fairy tale" is "conte de fee" . 

For those of you that have no idea why i am doing this
pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostella in Galicia
Spain, or better yet cannot imagine it and think i am
crazy...join the club, for over a thouand years people
have walked this pilgrimage and everyone has thought
they were nuts!!! YEA!  its a tradition.  Well, 10
years ago i was recruited by a college in the south on
a full volleyball scholarship, as a setter no less! 
This was my dream that carried me through high school.
 Thanks Coach!!!  Well, like money in the bank, i blew
it, and with no regrets came to Europe with an
exchange program that the college i was attending
arranged.  I came with 800.00 dollars and a back pack
full of some artsy things i had made so sell just
incase.  I told a person or two i would probably not
be back anytime soon.  I had years of adventures,
eventually fell in love in spain, lived in a very
small traditional village in the country that after 6
months of not really undrestanding the special dialect
and the special country ways, drove me somewhat crazy,
so i left and went to Galicia where there is an
amazingly long Celtic history.  On the rainy night in
the fall when i arrived in Santiago de Compostella i
met a girl, a college student and she gave me the key
to her dorm room and said she would be gone for a
month or so.  I hung out in that crusty town, in the
central plaza- the "puta plaza de Quintana", i watched
stinky, dirty pilgrims pour into that plaza by the
hundreds, and i knew they were banannas, i would never
do such a thing!!!  The look in their eyes, right
there at the finish line, walking form Rome,
Jerusliem, France, the Pyrenees...  was unforgetable. 
 I realized i was not crazy, that not only could i
freshly understand spanish, i could understand
portuguese, and gallego, the very special dialect from
galicia!!!  Something had clicked inside my head and
the fish form the "hitchikers guide to the galaxy" had
slipped into my ear. I had even learned spanish humor
living in that small spanish village with the artists
and comedans and actors, musicians and elderly. One
day from over 150 meters away i saw a young man and a
young woman and their child walking into the plaza.  I
invited them for a beer.  They stayed with me in the
dorm room for a week or so and when they were leaving
to "go to the mountains" i asked if i could join them.
  We made it through galicia, esturias, the Basque
country and into the Pyrenees.  There i found some
people where i could stay and work and take care of
their kids and stuff for a warm place to sleep and
food.  Eventually i started walking around those
amazing mountains and taking long trips into the high
mountains to the boxwood forests and to the peaks of
the mountains, staying in the pastors houses, open all
year for the passing sheep pastors with food and
firewood.    After a few months of nomad mountain
living the people that lived the closest to the really
big mountains offered me a house. A spring, a
fireplace, blankets, a chair, a table, a new roof and
a solid door and a matress to sleep on.  The best part
was the bedroom upstairs, the whole southern wall was
replaced with plexiglass, and the mountains on the
opposing slope in Spain are snow capped all year long.
 The mountain people assured me that with their help i
would make it through the winter.  It is hard even now
to imagine such a gift, but it is true.  I ended up
not staying the winter because i could not bring
myself to chop down a tree for firewood, and i was out
of money and knew i could find work in switzerland.
Before i left, my good friend looked at me and in
english said, "what else could you possibly ever want
in Switzerland...higher mountains?"  That has echoed
in my head thousands of times.  I am going back to
those mountains, with a wood gathering tool i have
brought with me from the Landcon jungle, i don't think
i will have to chop any trees down, at least not any
live ones.  Another cabin has been offered to me, and
my options are much greater that i can  imagine.    

   The short story i would like to share about my
friend who asked if it was true that the french "blow
the shit out of their ass" is:   This amazing
character happened to be my kind of "boyfriend" when i
left to come to europe the first time.  I am not much
of a "boyfriend" keeper seeing as i prefer total
liberty for myself and others.  Anyway, cheers to him
for answering all of my collect calls and talking with
me for as long as we could continue, without being
rushed and with a heart of christaline support.  There
is nothing like a friend in the world, especially when
you are stuck out and unable to understand one word of
what people are saying.  Like the Mexicans say  "Dios
te vendiga!" compa!!!  I will never forget that
kindness, and i hope to return the kindness someday,
somewhere.  Cheers as well to your heavinly Melody!

I hope you are well, the air is clean enough in your
neighborhood to take deep breaths and feel the love as
it rushes in. Thank you for joining me on my journey,
not for one moment do i ever feel alone with ya'll in
my heart and in my mind.

    I am off directly to the mountains, hopefully the
shortest route, even though i might feel lost most of
the route in bliss, i am already there.  And the
sweetness of the south settles in one step at a
time.....      Ultreia,   terrapin gin
