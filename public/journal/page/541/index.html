<p>Tomorrow is OKC!!  I logged on to AIM to see if I
could reach my peeps that I'll be driving, and I got
to talk to Christina and confirm she'll be at the
church at 4:30 and we'll leave to pick up the rest of
the crew in the Woodlands.</p>

<p>I also got to talk with Tanner, Laura, and
Hillary!</p>

<p>Fun to read all the journals and see the excitement
building before the rally.  These are so fabulously
positively powerful in YRUU.  I'm honored to be a part
of the magic.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is OKC Rally!  I'm super excited about it,
and trying to coordinate when/where to pick up youth
in the Houston area.  Right now it's all hinging on
Christina L calling me back to say if she can meet us
at 4:30 or not.  I'm pretty irked that she didn't call
me back yesterday like she said she would, and I'm
probably being a wuss about it, but I called and left
a message, telling her to let me know by 8pm tonight
what time she could meet.  I have a guess that she
will not call back and then complain when things don't
go her way.</p>

<p>I called Pahl, and he said he's not going.  He
couldn't afford the $20 for the van ride.  That sucks,
but I just said, "okay," because he didn't seem too
interested in working something out to make it
happen.</p>

<p>As always, things will fall perfectly into
place.</p>

<p class=date>12:39am CDT Friday 8 June 2001</p></p>

<p>I've just spent about an hour and a half balancing the most recent
two statements from our brokerage with our records for our investment
club.  Down to the penny we match, but something is screwed up in the
club's "internal" accounts.  The suspense account (which records cash
that we own, but is earmarked for spending) has a negative balance.  I
think the problem is that I didn't transfer from bank to suspense a
check for $104.</p>

<p>I'm going to bed.  OKC tomorrow!  Today!!!!!!  We will be in
Oklahoma City within 24 hours!</p>

<p>Today was a most excellent programming day.  We had
a request to accomodate Chinese names in our system
and not assume the user wants their name written as
"lastname, firstname."  Worked out a technique with
Kevin that requires only a tiny change to our username
database, allows lots of flexibility, and doesn't
require significant coding changes to the existing
programs.  (Yes, it does require a function call each
place we *used* to just write the names.)  We call a
function and it polls the database, returns a string
based on the user's preference, and based on a
parameter sent to the function call on whether to
return "firstname lastname" or "lastname, firstname." 
It basically just ignores the requested order for
Chinese and always returns "Lastname Firstname."</p>

<p>Nice.</p>

Hi,
Thanks for the note. I would really appreciate if you can give us an
estimate of the costs for the changes by tomorrow because we will be
meeting with the people tomorrow afternoon.

Rob, we would love to have you visit us. MUST think of a way to
rationalise
it...

HI Winnie!

I literally thought about writing to you last night!  How surprising to
get an email from you this morning!

I'm *so* glad you had a great time in Houston; I would love to somehow
rationalize a trip to Singapore!

I am just about to implement a new version of the G3 "Generic 360"
hopefully by tomorrow afternoon.  Then I can begin the changes required
for your survey.
</pre>

<p>blah blah blah from there; I described the some of the changes and
stuff, but the point is, that we may figure out a way for me to visit
Singapore!</p>

<p>Work was pretty darn great today.  I completed the
work part of my day at about 5pm, when I zipped over
to Mission Burritos to munch with Wende during her
lunch.  I rode my bike over there, and she was way way
way longer in getting there than I.  Funny.  I read an
issue of Out or some gay/lesbian newspaper that was on
one of the tables outside.</p>

<p>After that I zipped back to work and have spent the
last 4.5 hours doing stuff for GenXchange, our
investment club.  I spent about 2 hours filling out a
Stock Selection Guide for BP Amoco (which pretty much
appears to be a good purchase right now for long term
holding), and then I spent 2.5 hours tracking down a 5
cent error in my records (I'm the treasurer of the
club) as opposed to the records of our brokerage
firm.</p>

<p>Turns out I had not entered a $10.00 deposit and a
$9.95 payment.  Net error: 5 cents.</p>

<p>That was for the statement ending March 30.  The
statement for April 30 is WAY off.  Damn.  And the 
online accounting software I'm using is suddenly slow.
 I guess it's time to pack it up for the night.</p>

<p>I called Wende who will give me a ride home
tonight. Yeah on one hand I'm flaking, and on the
other hand... I'm tired.</p>

                        <p><title>Tropical Storm Allison</title>
<p class=date>6:14pm CDT Tuesday 5 June 2001</p></p>

<p>While at work, Wende call me at work. "Do you want me to pick you
up?  It's raining."</p>

<p>"Naw; I'll be fine."</p>

<p>Several minutes later she called back, "Rob, you <em>can't</em>
ride home from work, it's a Tropical Storm!" as if it's a universal
law that people can't exceed the speed of light, or ride bikes in a
tropical storm.</p>

<p>"I know; it's tropical storm Allison; I already knew that."</p>

<p>"Well, Allison has caused three leaks in our roof so I gotta go."</p>

<p>"Okay, bye."</p>

<p>So I put a garbage bag over my backpack, put on my helmet, gloves,
socks, shoes, garbage-bag-covered back pack.  Looked outside; it was
barely sprinkling.  No worries, mate.</p>

<p>Rode home, with my lights on, watching for traffic, quads slightly
tired from all the riding I've done recently, wonderfully soothing
rain keeping me cool.  Got the mail on the way inside.</p>

<p>Wende didn't say HI.</p>

<p>A few minutes later she expressed that she was mad that I didn't
let her pick me up because it was such a little thing that would have
made her feel a lot better and shouldn't have made me feel worse if I
let her pick me up.  Notice that: <em>shouldn't have</em>.  That's a
projection if I ever saw one.</p>

<p>I reflected back what she said, as an acknowledgement that I heard
her.  Then I told her I would have felt a bit bad, like I had given
up, given up my ... decision to ride my bike just because it started
raining.  It's like a vegan going, "Oh, we'll I'll eat meat cause
there doesn't happen to be any vegan food that I can reach without
getting rained on."  Fuck that.  I'm riding my bike.</p>

<p>Now if the wind was knocking down trees and blowing hail all over
the place, lightning striking the ground every 20 seconds, I would
have either (1) waited until the storm blew over, or (2) asked
politely for the favor of a ride home.  But not for a fucking sprinkle
and a bit of wind, even if it's officially a Tropical Storm.</p>

<p>AND WHILE I'M RANTING about tropical storms, you know what's
stupid???  That every year the weather service <em>starts over</em>
with the letter A to name the damn storms!  Allison, Alfred, Alicia,
Albert... But how often do they get to R?  Never.  Or damn
infrequently.  What about the dude named Xavier?  When will he ever
get a storm named after him?  I bet the weather service is all wussie,
going, "we won't have enough Q and X names to last more than 3 years."
MAKE SOME UP!  Have a fucking contest and have people send in names.
That will increase people's awareness of storms and storm safety,
which is the point of the weather service anyway, right??</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p class=date>6:50pm</p>

<p>Wow.  It's raining a huge downpour now.  I would have possibly
called Wende if it had been raining this effectively when I left
work.</p>

<p class=dream>In a college building, at a dance of some sort and I
had to pee.  I went downstairs to the restroom because the upstairs
restroom was occupied.  There were guys cleaning the downstairs
restroom, but I used it anyway.  One guy was cleaning a gum stain off
the carpeted(!) restroom floor, and I stepped in it.</p>

<p class=dream>He was all "watch out!" at first, but then said it was
okay because he only cleaned it up as an attempt to win a contest of
who could be on call and respond the fastest to a cleaning emergency
at the school.</p>

<p class=dream>I drove up the highway back to the top floor again and
people were having an outdoor party thing including a huge thirty
gallon container of orange juice.</p>

<p class=date>5:14am CDT Monday 4 June 2001</p>
<p class=note>(dream)</p></p>

<p class=dream>In a parking lot, trying to park Wende's truck, Butch.
I had trouble seeing well in the rear view and side view mirrors, but
after a few tries, I got it parked beside an identical truck.  As I
got out, a woman got in to her truck and began to drive away, but
didn't take off the emergency brake, which was locking the front
wheels.  They were just sliding along the slick layer of wet leaves on
the parking lot.</p>

<p class=dream>I thought for sure she would notice, but when she tried
to turn, and was barely able to do so (no friction to turn if the
wheels aren't spinning), I tried to get her attention.  I whistled my
shrillest whistle at her, but she never looked at me.  She drove out
of the parking lot and tried to turn right down a street.  The truck
was barely turning, so she hit the gas harder to compensate, and she
crashed pretty heavily into some cars parked on the street.</p>

<p class=dream>I turned away at the moment of the crash and then
looked back; the truck was pretty much okay, but she was shaken around
in it a lot.  I called 911 on my cell phone, but it thought I typed
912, and didn't do anything.</p>

<p>I was relieved when I suddenly woke up.  I went back to sleep.</p>

<p class=dream>At a party at my old house in 3rd grade and my car
Scott was supposed to be on the street right at the corner, but I
looked outside and it wasn't there.  I went down the street to look
for it, and  I was walking down the hall and suddenly saw the license
plate on the ground, and a woman was talking to a cop about something
and I was all, "that's my fuckin' license plate!"  The cop was all, "sir,
you'll need to calm down; we will take care of this." and I was all,
"okay, I'm calm" and I sat in a meditative state on the ground for
them to finish.</p>

<p class=dream>Their conversation turned to me and Wende and our
living arrangement.  "They live very close to one another on a street
called Uptown or something."  And I was all "yes we are living
together on Upton, we are getting married on June 21 of this year."
(*) </p>

<p class=dream>The cop was all, "you're what?" and "Don't tell me
you're getting married. That's the problem with this younger
generation, everyone is getting married because it's like some fashion
statement and so popular to get married."  I interrupted her "um,
we've been engaged for 2 years; I think we will be okay.  Plus we've
been dating for 5 years."</p>

<p class=dream>They seemed less concerned about our decision, and
started talking about Scott again, and I woke up.</p>

<p>(*) No, we did not move, and did not change the date of the
wedding.  It's still next year, 2002.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I didn't write the dream down, but fell asleep again.</p>

<p class=dream>In New York City, sliding along icy treacherous ground;
it was so slick and wet that some people were on their hands and
knees, or had just fallen and others were helping them up.  Traffic
was aggressive and I had to really work to nudge my way into traffic.
In the middle of the intersection, a woman was sliding along with no
problem, and said that it was no problem and she didn't understand
what all the other people were having trouble with.  I told her that
in some places, it was really messed up.  I couldn't tell her, for
example, what it was like on 13th street, but it seems that anywhere
the street is big nd flat, the snow has formed a layer of ice and then
fluffy snow on top of that makes it very nice for sliding.  But in the
gutter on the side of the street, all the water has runoff there, and
it's all yucky and gross.</p>

<p class=dream>"By the way, what street is that?" I asked, pointing to
a cross street.  "Thirteenth."  "Really?" Ahahahahahahhahahaahaa!!
"That is so ironic!  I've got to write that down with my dream.</p>

<p class=dream>So I walked down the hall of the hotel and looked for
an internet port that I could use.  I saw a woman in a computer
monitor, but she was just behind a desk, and it turns out she didn't
understand what I was asking for.  "Do you have any terminals with
internet connectivity?"  "You need a hard drive for your computer?"
"No, I just need to get access to my email online.  Like hotmail.com
or yahoo.com or any of the others."  "Let me ask someone."</p>

<p class=dream>She paged on the walkie talkie system and after a
while, a guy answered from the bathroom.  "This is Dave; I'm in the
restroom, but maybe I can still help."  I looked at the asparagus on
the counter in front of me as I listened to their conversation.  "I
have a guest here who needs to fix his computer; he can't get his
email."</p>

<p>Fortunately, I woke up.  What a nightmare!  Plus it would have been
very unfortunate to write this whole dream down while in my dream.</p>

<p>It's 5:48am; I'm going back to sleep.</p>

<p>Hmm.  With emacs, I don't know how to include an n with a tilde
instead of just an n in the middle of the word.  Hmmm.</p>

<p>Even so, spanish class was fun, and I have decided I'm losing my
crush on the cutie named Gabriella.  Not entirely gone, but a bit less
than in our most recent class.  Hablando in espanol mas ahora - full
conversations a veces.  A veces solamente escucho.</p>

<p>I rode my bike home from class, and I actually beat Wende home!
She stopped by Walgreen's though.  But it was still fun to arrive home
before she did.  Si, soy muy rapido.  (That probably means something
that I don't intend for it to mean.)</p>

<p>I plan to visit work early-ish tomorrow and hopefully get some shit
done!!!</p>

<p>Oh! That reminds me of something funny: in pairs, we were racing to
translate phrases that Isabel (our instructor) read.  She read, "Tiene
un buen dia," and I blurted out "I have a good idea! ...  shit," and
everyone laughed because it was pretty funny, and I cursed in English,
etc.  anyway, it was funny.  (It means "have a good day.")</p>

<p>Tiene un buen noche.</p>
