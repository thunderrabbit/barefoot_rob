                        <p class=date>12:53am JST Thursday 4 September 2003</p>

<p>This weekend I spent a lot of time messing with my website, most
notably installing the latest SpamAssassin (v 2.55) and goofing around
with BBST (not to any tangible result).  Wrote to Fred cause I haven't
heard from him in a while and got a couple of lunch meetings set up
with Nova students for next weekend.  Satoko (leaving for CA on 20
September) and Rieko (>M&lt; voice a couple weeks ago).</p>

<p>I'm glad to have these set up; I haven't been able to converse
Japanesely for basically some weeks since I've seen Nami at Fujikyu.
I occassionally get emails from her that she's still working at 6 and
7am, but she'll write to me when she's less busy.  Wow, that's
late.</p>

<p>1am is late enough for me; I'm going to bed.  But I want to play MarbleBlast.</p>

<p class=date>2:00am</p>

<p>Okay, 2am is late enough for me. bed bed bed now.</p>

i am thouroughly not enjoying my classes nor can i spell.  it seems as though after all the renovations that nothing works so teachers keep having these short 30 min classes.  you would think that i would enjoy this but i dont.  my time is valuable these days.  today i could have slept an extra hour and cleaned for a bit instead of comming to class for 20 min to talk about how people in england were dirty and poor.  like i didnt already know that!  i am also in a computer course where she can not get the projector to work.  i KNOW it does work bec. i have that classroom on mon and wed for my management class.  so what does that say about the teacher?  i mean i NEED to know these programs for my real life job not just for school.  grrrr it makes me mad this year i/my mom spent almost 4000.00 on tuition alone and a shit load on books.  i need to learn i really want to learn this year.<br>
<br>
and economics&hellip;.ohhhhh my god.  its like they are teaching 2yr olds.  aparentlly all the econs are now taught by graduate students with these slides that they ALL use that says at the begining what your going to learn, then it says the deffinitions and shows a few charts.  then it says okay so today we learned&hellip;. and repeats it so you hear it 3 freakn times!!!!!!!  i am not a baby.  i do not want to go to the class it makes me want to rip my hair out.  <br>
<br>
i should not feel that way at all.  i wish the teachers wouldnt follow the rules, that they would do it in a fun way where we would all want to participate and &hellip;..ughhhh<br>
<br>
can you tell i have too  much free time today, i should have brought a book to read&hellip;.i had thought i wouldnt have time.<br>
<br>
well anyways,  i still dont have a bicycle.  and my sisters is still in the woodlands and nobody wants to bring it to me&hellip;.i think doing something physical will be good for me.<br>
<br>
ohhhh ohhhhh ohhhhhh  my real sister and i are wanting to go some where this summer.  somewhere worth going where we could learn a bit and not spend a whole lot of money and have a lot of fun.  <br>
where would you suggest.  NOT in the continental United States please.  We have been and are going to continue saving &hellip;.but i dont know what would be worth our time and money<br>
<br>
any ideas??? i know this dude in japan i could visit&hellip;. heheheeee  but really, where have you been or know of that you think would fit me best?<br>
<br>
when do you come back to the U.S?<br>
<br>
I guess thats a lot to write, i am done now.<br>
<br>
Love your Son,<br>

<p>Finally.  A storm worth writing home about.  Still softer than an
awesome summer storm in Houston, but it could be considered a good
first storm of the summer in Houston.  Lightning.  Thunder. Slanted
rain.  Nothing outstanding.</p>

<p>People used umbrellas while walking in covered breezeways.</p>

<p>Fun lesson with Yumi today.  As a result, I'm late to meet Shin
again this week.  Unacceptable; somethin's got to give.  I don't meet
with her next Wednesday; maybe we can change our meeting day to
Saturday or something.  I am usually free on Saturday evenings.</p>

<p>It's not just that I was 8 minutes late leaving our lesson that I'm
late for Shin. In Shinjuku, the Yamanote line wasn't moving.  What the
fuck is up with that?  Two weeks in a row there's been fucked up
delays on the trains.  good thing is that I'm learning new lines to
get to the same places.  Today I used Saikyu line from Shinjuku to
Shibuya which was only 1 stop instead of 4, so it's faster to
"Shibuya" but there's a long walk to get from the Saikyu platform of
Shibuya to the main part of Shibuya.</p>

<p>I'm meeting Yumi on Saturday (in 3 days); maybe we can switch to
Saturday from now on.</p>

<p>Japanese class was pretty diverse today. Rasumi was there, which
was cool.  She has distracted me from afar before and now I got to be
distracted right across the table.  She's got one dark tooth, but
everything else seems pretty optimal.  Physical appearance wise at
least.  Her Japanese seems fluent, but she says she doesn't know a lot
of the vocab.</p>

<p>Then another cat named Clark came in.  He's been in Japan for 2
years and just blows me an Olivia away.  Then another girl named
something else came and she also has more nihongo skills than me and
Olivia combined.  Very frustrating.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Hanging out with Fumi in Shibuya was cool; we found a toy store
with fun magnet construction thingies - remniscent of Tinkertoys or
Erector Set, but better.  Went to an Italian restaurant in the area
and chowed a thin crust white bread 4 cheese pizza and some leaf
shaped cheese covered pasta.  She told me that I was the only one of
five teachers to call her back when she looked us up on
englishteachers.com or something like that.</p>

<p>After LOTS of sleep, flipping and flopping about in bed, talking to
janette (!) this morning, sleeping some more, I got myself to work on
time.  Steve happened to be on the same train, but I chose to zip up
the stairs instead of talk to him on the way to work.</p>

<p>Had four lessons today so far and they've gone pretty well.  Four
more lessons until my weekend.  Said HI to Miki who is now in Level 5
(today was her first L5 lesson and she said she was nervous; I was
like, "chill; it's no biggie;" I wonder if it helped), news that she
told me after she said, "my life is like hell," when I asked if today
was her first day of school: "yes." "how is it?"  "I hate it; my life
is like hell." "Wow." "Today is my first level five lesson."</p>

<p>Had a student who is barely 7B.  Had her man to man and she was
really low; had lots of trouble with is/are and has/have.  The lesson
was "which ones are yours?" and in the book it's depicts a couple
leaving a party and picking up their coats.  I was like fuck that and
laid out a bunch of animal flash cards.  "Which ones are birds," and
by the end she could say "these are birds" and barely "this one is a
bird" (lot of work on the pronunciation of "this") and rarely
correctly, "these animals have tails" or "this animal is brown" or
"this animal is a cow"...  she got all the little words mixed up,
which is understandable; they're all fuckin' useless words in many
ways, but hey.  That's English.</p>

<p>That's language.  words words words.</p>

<p>My three Level 4 women got a lesson on earthquakes and hurricanes
and tornadoes and lightning, with a side platter of electrons,
protons, nucleus, atom.  I skipped neutron because we were just
focusing on charge, without regard to specific atoms nor mass.</p>

<p class=date>9:18pm</p>

<p>On the train now to roll outta Kawasaki for my weekend.  Just
finished off the night with voice, starring Kenji, Miki, someone, and
Yukiyoshi (I think).   Miki again said she hates high school and I got
a sense of how much the Japanese workers are being screwed by their
companies - working until 2am and feeling lucky to have a job.  Okay
fine, lucky to have a job, but not a sucky job that pays nothing extra
for ridiculous amounts of overtime.</p>

<p>I basically told Miki she should try to get the hell outta Japan
and go to the US and try to get a job; I'll give her Philip's contact
info next time I see her.  Maybe I'll remember to look up the info for
the Japanese-American Society of Houston.</p>

<p>When I got home today, Frank gave me a number for Alberta, a woman
whose son he is tutoring in history.  I may tutor him in programming.
Everything is a crisis for her, it seems, but Frank said her husband
and son are pretty cool.</p>

<p>Dream included</p>

<p class=dream>sitting in a chair mounted on the back of Scott, like
the bicycle rack and having two women laying on top of me in a
flirting but not overtly sex-having way.  Some YRUU-calibre kittens
were walking by and were kinda shocked, but pretty much got over it.
I had to pee so I went to the restroom and peed and in the bottom of
the sink was a pilot light because for some reason there was a burner
in the bottom of the sink.  I thought that was strange, but thought it
was more strange that I <em>still</em> had to pee, and then realized I
had only peed in my dream</p>

<p>so I woke up and peed.</p>

<p>Got an email from janette unreacting to her reaction to my recent
journal entry featuring my reaction to our conversation.  She didn't
know what time it was in JST so she didn't email my ketai to wake me
up.  Very considerate.</p>

<p>I'm at my station; gotta go.</p>

<p class=date>8:32am</p>

<p>Kay.  on the next train (Musashi-Kosugi to Kawasaki)</p>

<p>(nice timing; usually this connection is a 10 minute disconnect)</p>

<p>Yeah, I was mad at Janette and my reaction is to say fuckit and
fuckoff, but I'm trying to love the entirety of the situation and
embrace the higher lesson, plus I want to have an awesome vacation
with her and not a sucky one.</p>

<p>Some of my journal entries are written in heightened emotional
states, and I don't always remember specifics of what I wrote or why I
wrote it.  If this is to be truly for me but open to the public, like
a true Truman Show, then I have to write whatever I want and be able
to forget about it if I forget about it.  Janette asked me what I
meant by something and I didn't remember exactly and I choose not to
spend time backtracking and refinding my thoughts *and* write in slow
email medium at the same time.  Thoughts race through my brain 100
times faster than I can write, plus email is sterile while thoughts
are organic dynamic rabbits racing about my mind.</p>

<p>There's a story in my head about a cat who wrote *everything* that
went through his mind.  I don't really see how that's possible; I got
the sense that this occurred back in the day before computers, and
even so, I can't possibly type as fast as I can think.  But this story
was described to me and commented that the day to day events weren't
necessarily interesting, but the feat itself was impressive.  I like
to think my feats are as impressive.  Even more impressive than my
feet.</p>

<p>Arrival in Kawasaki has occurred.</p>

<p>Okay, I'm going to work on translating my thing for an hour or
until it's finished, and then send it off to Ayana for checking.</p>

<p>Work was aight though no voice nor frees.  Couple man to mans.  But
excellent news: I'm working at KQ on Saturdays this month (September).
That rules.</p>

<p>The stinky news is that I have to be at Kawasaki more often when
Steve is there. That stinks.  But I'll get over it.</p>
