<p>Amanda says, "say something funny?  No, it's too difficult."</p>

<p>Earlier she cracked me up with her emphasis/accent on the word
"heaving:"</p>

<p>"I went to Kyoto in April and it was absolutely heaving with
people."</p>

<p>We've been buds on this Hakone day trip.  She hates roller
coasters, skydiving and anything scary.  She's married, has no job and
is a published journalist.</p>

<p>In short, we have nothing in common until we found that we both
know a bit about the zodiac and have similar non-dramatic views of
religion.  (bad description, but meh (like our sense of religion))</p>

<p>We're about to arrive at the boat-stop in Hakone, but I don't think
we'll make the departure in 3 minutes.</p>

<p>Nevermind; we will!</p>

<p>5:00 ish</p>

<p>Boat was cold.  Big gondola up to the top of the mountain where it
was even blusterier and colder.</p>

<p>Amanda says, "I like the fact that it was beautiful and you could
see out to the Pacific and the sun was starting to set, although it
was a bit misty."</p>

<p>At the souvenier shop, I took pictures of the trick box houses that
I chose not to buy for Fred.  We did however, get him another puzzle.
I'll take a picture of it before I take it apart to give to him.  I'll
not let him have a pic of it; that cat is too good a putting together
puzzles for any hints like what the finished product should look
like.</p>

<p>Amazing.</p>

<p>In the shrine at Fifth Station up Mt Fuji, I stood in front of the
money dump box, unzipped the change pocket on my wallet, turned it
upside down, and released my fear around money.  Came to the mantra,
"I am financially wealthy."</p>

<p>Some money got caught by the folds in the pocket; I declared that
must mean it's still for me to keep.</p>

<p>Ma gave me 2000 yen to tide me over until payday in 2 days.  In 31
hours (midnight tomorrow tomorrow night)</p>

<p>Took the shinkansen home to Shin Yokohama, paid for as part of the
tour today.  Talked to Jana and Sharon in the *last* seat on the
train, which was the first three vacant seats in a row.  Talk talk
talk, ate chocolate.  Traded emails.</p>

<p>Got off the train, went downstairs, recognized I had no proof of my
ticket.  No receipt thing; I had left it on the train.</p>

<p>Cost to get out of the train station: 1900 yen.</p>

<p>Fuck.</p>

<p>Train to Kikun from Shin Yokohama, (which I hoped would be rolled
into the shinkansen ticket) cost: 110 yen.</p>

<p>Thank you, ma, for covering my dumb ticket losing dumbness.  (all
but 10 yen, that is)</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I'm walking from Kikuna to my apartment (1.5 local stations away).
Started walking at 7.  Oh, I called Shin to say I could meet him
tonight.  Wonder if we can meet and allow the universe to provide me
with some cash.</p>

<p>It's 7:25 now.  I've written these two entries on a swingset near
the train line.  Near the intersection of Tokyu Toyoko line and the
shinkansen.</p>

<p>walking again.</p>

<p class=date>7:42pm</p>

<p>Home.</p>

<p class=date>8:02pm</p>

<p>Shin cannot meet me tonight.</p>

  5th station at mt fuji?  did you go to mt. fuji?<br>
  interesting that you affirmed your wealth and came up with enough + 10 yen to finish the day.<br>

Miki, Miki, Rachel, Rachel, et al, et al, were all there.  Really felt
good to be welcomed into the group.  Carla paid 2000 yen for my orange
juices and gyouza.  Kaori encouraged me to drink sake so I asked for
something sweet.  It was orangey and sweet with a little alcohol in
it.  Dunno what alcohol nor even the name of the drink.</p>

<p>In this picture are Yutaka, KG Miki, Rachel, Aiko, Bill, Miki,
Kaori, Mamiko, Miho, Rachel, Lyle</p>

<p>Invited both Miki's to see Nami's tap recital on the 24th.</p>

used to be a kindergarten teacher, so (though no one calls her KG
Miki), I'm distinguishing her this way) thinks she doesn't know enough
English to go overseas, but she totally does and I totally told
her.</p>

<p>Made it home on the last train.</p>

<p>Yammered with Sharon a bit on the way up the cablecar thing to the
freezing windy area, then yammered with her and her friend Jana after
we dropped off peeps (including my mom, Jon, and Amanda, et. al.)</p>

<p>They're good natured crazy fun lovin' American girls,
adventuresome, apparently hard working, etc.</p>

<p>But the point is they brought up a critical question for me: "what
do you do?"</p>

<p>If I haven't been to a bath-house and I don't go out, what do I do?
I could account quickly for 3 days: 3 theme parks. But what about the
months?  Studying Japanese?  Not really.  You know what it is?  this
computer.  This is my time-sucker.</p>

<p>Encouragement to get out and do stuff.  Not worry too much about
Learning Japanese; just get out there and dance.  Dance I said.
Salt-n-Pepper's here, inside my head.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Funny:</p>

<p>(first, I'll say that I told our tour guide she should not say,
"very much difficult." I felt a bit uneasy charging in, but that was
the most rampant error she had been making.  (I didn't charge in while
she was speaking, but after she finished and we were on the freeway)
She thanked me; I hope she appreciated it.)</p>

<p>Then she was got on the mic, "My name is Hiromi and I'm here to
say, I rock the mic every day."</p>

<p>Oh, wait; she said, "at least one of you is an English teacher.
I'll introduce you a funny and embarassing story in Japan."</p>

<p>My version of the story:</p>

<p>The former PM of Japan didn't know English, so when he met Clinton,
he was all to his cat, "what do I say?" and the guy was like say, "how
are you?"  and then when he says "I'm fine," say "me too."</p>

<p>So Morisan was all, "Who are you?" when he greeted Clinton.</p>

<p>Clinton said, "I'm the husband of Hillary."</p>

<p>"Me too."</p>

<p>hahahahaha.</p>

<p>Went to Nikko today.  Cool temples, but not any more amazing that
Kyoto.  Actually less amazing, but definitely more out of the big
city.   Large 300 year old cedars chillin' nearby.</p>

<p>Saw a monkey try to come into the souvenir store / restaurant thing
where we were.  A woman on staff screamed "saru!" and shriek-yelled at
it until it left.  Poor guy is hungry, I'm sure.   I got a tiny
spec of a monkey walking on all fours down the sidewalk in a picture.</p>

<p>Mostly the tour was rainy and misty and cool-cold.  Not fabulous
touring weather, and still plenty of people and buses.  It might be
more fun in the spring.  But not January.</p>

<p>Nikko includes a shrine (temple?) where they conked foot-long wooden oak
conkers together and they went [CLINk] in one part of the room, but
then when he did it right underneath the dragon they went
[CLINKKKKKKKKKKKkkkkkk] reverberating for 10 seconds.  "That's the
sound of the dragon crying."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Took ma and Jon to the Mexican restaurant in Shibuya.  Jon lagged a
lot as we walked.  Ma kept up pretty well.  They were both tired by
the end of our adventure.  We left earlier than I would have, but not
too much so.</p>

<p>In Shinagawa station I showed ma how to get to Yokohama station, in
case that information helps her when the need to come to my area on
Sunday.  We'll see what happens.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Speaking of not knowing what will happen; I'm not sure how I'll get
home from Hakone tomorrow.  Shinkansen yes, but I wonder how I'll be
taken slash dropped off at the shinkansen station.  Atami?  Odawara
probably.</p>

<p>(btw, Becker's has a morning menu without a chicken sandwich. Bunch
of croissants and crap; I wanna sammich)</p>

<p>so instead I went to the convenience store and an old guy was
walking without watching where he was going and I was like, <em>hey
man, watch where you're going</em></p>

<p>Though he wasn't watching where he was going, the clerks were
watching.  He tried to roll out of the store with his 200 yen (*)
worth of breakfast, but the clerk pushed a button and called some cats
from the back who (gently) caught him and took his goods. I dunno
where/what is next for him.</p>

<p>Fixed a problem with Kim Sawyer's website tonight.   For some
reason the sci-fi content was completely missing from the site.   I
had a backup and restored it.  Whew.</p>

<p>Ma and Jon are in town!</p>

<p>I'm going to see them (sneak into the hotel overnight tonight) and
go with them on their tour (not sneaking in) tomorrow.   Whoohoo!</p>

<p>Oooh gotta charge my camera batteries tonight.</p>

<p class=date>9:06pm</p>

<p>For some reason my name isn't on the tour for tomorrow, so I can't
go with them to Nikko.  Except *also*, Jon hurt his knee today so he
will forfeit is seat on the tour so that I can take his place and he
can chill in the hotel for a day. Very convenient.  Mental hugs and
love to his knee for giving me a chance to be harassed by monkeys
tomorrow.</p>

<p>I'm on Toyoko line train now, headed for Shibuya. Then to
Shinagawa.  Then to bounce over to the Prince hotel.  Rock.</p>

<p class=date>11:04pm JST Monday 10 November 2003</p>

<p>Made it to the hotel with no problem.  Was able to make out the
hiragana and katakana on the station map to find generally where the
hotel was, read the English signage once I got near the hotel and
basically walked straight to their room though I had no conscious idea
which direction to go.  Though she told me over the phone where to go;
I didn't really draw a map in my mind as she told me; it just kinda
fell into place.  Sweet.</p>

<p>Today at work I was asking why/complaining about how if we sign a
shift swap with another employee, the request only goes as far as
scheduling, but not payroll.  I can see how payroll (corporate level)
and scheduling (branch / area level) are two separate functions, but I
wonder why Nova verbally enforces us to pay the difference in value
between two separate shifts.  Basically a weekend shift is worth more
than a weekday shift, and a late shift is worth more than an early
shift.  And people who have been here longer make more money than
those who have not.  Their time spent working is "worth more" than the
other person's time spent working.</p>

<p>So the idea is if two people do a shift swap, and the shifts are
not of equal value (due to the shift or the employee), the employees
are asked to settle the difference.</p>

<p>Because this settlement request is coming from Nova, then it should
be handled by payroll; the correct salary should be paid to each
employee.  Done.  No employee worries about anything but covering the
shift they agreed to cover.</p>

<p>But it's not.  We have to "take care of it ourselves"</p>

<p>ANYWAY, I was like, "that's dumb; either Nova should not care, or
they should make it happen."</p>

<p>Actually I was like, "why is it like this (dumb way)?"</p>

<p>JLo was like, "because the pay-difference is handled by each
individual."</p>

<p>I'm like, "no, each pay-difference is handled because Nova doesn't
make the adjustment at payroll.  It's like the shift-swap only goes
halfway."  (at this point I hadn't recognized the functions of payroll
and functions of scheduling take place at different levels of the
hierarchy.)</p>

<p>"Yes, that's right."  JLo agreed with me as if he always had been
agreeing.  "But Nova would have to make a whole new department to
handle the requests."</p>

<p>I was thinking, <em>no; they just fix it once in the computers;
make it an integrated system</em></p>

<p>"they would hire yakuza to enforce the collection; it's better to
just have the individuals do it."</p>

<p>Oh my god.</p>

<p>It woulda been funny if they were joking.</p>
