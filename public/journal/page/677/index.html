<p>
Last night I played Ultimate at University of Houston as we do each Saturday night. Ultimate is the best frisbee game in the world, for those who don&rsquo;t know.
<p>
The coolest thing lately is that a lot of new players (incoming freshman who live in the residence halls) have joined us this year. And they&rsquo;re all good; some of them play super excellently!
<p>
HellKat, Mike, Jenny (sp), Rick, John, and Terry arrived (in that order) to play.  Jenny is the best of the new group; she has played in the past.
<p>
We played either 4 or 5 games, and I did relatively well, including a surprise difficult sideways one handed catch (scored a point), and a tumbling on my back roll non catch (but close) and fun stuff like that.
<p>
After the games it was like 2:45 in the am, and I walked Kat back to the dorms. We drank Gatorade and talked down in the basement. John said HI a couple of times as he was doing his laundry.
<p>
Got home and to bed around 3:45, super exhausted after a great time playing.

Today Wende and I walked to Marble Slab for some ice cream. Yummy delicious! We rationalized that by walking, we would work off the calories gained by eating there.
<p>
On the way back, we stopped at TravelFest, which is like a splashy jazzy colorful fresh new multi-service travel center, where you can watch videos of where you want to go, purchase luggage to take, and then purchase a ticket and away you go!<br />
<p>
I watched a video of some dudes snow skiing, snow boarding, and snow kayaking!! Incredible steep fast breathtaking way to travel 3000 feet. I totally wanna do that!! My friend Rocky, who lives in the Rocky Mountains has invited me to come snow boarding. That video certainly reminded me that I have that option open.
<p>
Wow.

Today I changed the format of my journal index to this calendar
look.  Yeah it looks kinda weird with various width columns and such, but I like it better.  Gives me a better sense of when things happened.</p>

<p><p>
Today things are kinda screwed up at work.  My supervisor said,
&ldquo;people should be jumping through their asshole to get this fixed.&rdquo;  I
thought that was a really funny phrase. He said I could use it anytime
I wanted.  :)

A super funny/awesome thing just happened here at work.
<p>
I&rsquo;m writing a new application that allows users to view their
invoices and print them in either text or postscript format.
Printing the text invoices is easy; each invoice is already stored as an individual file, and I just queue it to the printer.
<p>
Because of the screwed up way we do the postscript invoices, I have to extract from a huge file of invoices the individual postscript invoice, write it to a file, print that file and then delete the file.  Fine.
<p>
The current application that my code is replacing will break if you print three postscript invoices in quick succession. I made sure my code would not have that problem, but I didn&rsquo;t really want to test that because it would waste a lot of paper.
<p>
Today I made some modifications to my code to nicely display error messages to the user. So I&rsquo;m testing my code and purposely defined a logical incorrectly so it couldn&rsquo;t print. Each time I pressed &lsquo;P&rsquo;, it would say, &ldquo;cannot create file BLAHBLAHBLAHn. Call Customer Service&rdquo; or something like that.  The n was a number that was incremented each time &lsquo;P&rsquo; was pressed.
(for those technically inclined, this was simply to give each file a unique name). I held down &lsquo;P&rsquo; and watched the number happily increase with each failed attempt to create the file.
To test the robustness of my program, I used my phone receiver to hold down the &lsquo;P&rsquo; key. It had counted up to 2000 when I left to go talk to Pam.
<p>
I showed Pam my new error message setup&ndash; how it was much more user friendly and informative. To show her how it could handle three invoices being printed at time, I fixed the logical and hit &lsquo;P&rsquo; three times in a row. We went to the printer and waited for them to come up (had to put more paper in the printer tray) and it printed all three. No sweat. Yay!
<p>
Came back to my cube and my computer was having a heart attack! Beepbeepbeepbeepbeepbeep incessant beepbeepbeepbeep!!!!  What the heck??? It&rsquo;s printing!!  I ran over to the printer queue and it had printed about 20 invoices, and was still going. <em>Shit!</em> I paused the printer and came back to see what happened. I checked the printer queue and there were <strong>hundreds</strong> of identical jobs ready to print!  Ack!!!
<p>
I called Systems Management and had them kill the entire queue and recreate it. They did, and problem solved. But what had happened???
<p>
When I was at Pam&rsquo;s desk, and fixed the logical, my computer was able to successfully create the files! It had created and queued 750+ files in about 5 minutes! Yay!!! My program blows away the current program!! Inadvertant stress testing, and my code passed with no problem.

                        <p class=date>1 October 1997</p>

<p><p>
Today I felt moved to consult my Runes about my travel plans, and how I am so
excited and want to travel <em>now</em>!
<p></p>

<p>I did a 3 Rune spread.  The first Rune (reading from right to left) describes the
&ldquo;overview of the situation;&rdquo; the second Rune (center) identifies the &ldquo;challenge;&rdquo;
and the third Rune (left) indicates the &ldquo;course of action called for&rdquo;
<p></p>

<p>I had selected <em>Laguz</em>, <em>Eihwaz</em>, and <em>Sowelu</em></p>

<p><p>
I don&rsquo;t consciously know their meanings very well yet, so I consulted my book.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
Overview of the Situation:  <em>Laguz</em>:
<p>
Unseen powers are active here, powers that nourish, shape and connect.<br />
The attributes of this Rune are water, fluidity, the ebb and flow of emotions,
careers and relationships.  <em>Laguz</em> encourages you to immerse yourself in
the experience of living without having to evaluate or understand.  It speaks
to the satisfaction of emotional needs, to the awakening of the intuitive or
lunar side of your nature.  For while the sun strives for differentiation, the
moon draws us toward union and merging.
<p>
This Rune often signals a time for cleansing: for revaluing, reorganizing,
realigning.  A Rune of deep knowing, it may call you to study spiritual matters
in readiness for self-transformation.  Success now lies in contacting your
intuitive wisdom and attuning to your own rhythms.  A Rune of self relating
rightly to the Self, <em>Laguz</em>, signifies what alchemists called the conjunctio or
sacred marriage.  In fairy tales, it is the end where the hero and heroine live
happily ever after.
<p>
(the overview of my trip plans!! &ldquo;immerse myself in the experience of living&rdquo;
&ldquo;satisfaction of emotional needs&rdquo; &ldquo;cleansing, revaluing, reorganizing, realigning&rdquo;
&ldquo;self-transformation&rdquo;   <br>
I hear <em>this will be a rebirth of myself</em>   )
<p>
<hr>
<p>
Challenge: <em>Eihwaz</em>:
As we are tested we fund the power to avert blockage and defeat.  At the same
time, we develop in ourselves an aversion to the conduct that creates stress
in our lives.
<p>
If there appears to be an obstacle in  your path, consider that even a delay may
prove beneficial.  Do not be overly eager to press forward, for this is not a time
or situation in which you can make your influence felt.  patience is the counsel <em>Eihwaz</em> offers:
nothing hectic, no acting needy, or lusting after a desired outcome.  This rune speaks to
the difficulties that can arise at the beginning of a new life.  Often it announces a time
of waiting&ndash;for a spring to fill up with water, for fruit to ripen on the bough.
<p>
Perseverance and foresight are called for here.  The ability to foresee consequences
before you act is a mark of the profound person.  Avert anticipated difficulties through
right action, this Rune is saying.  And yet even more than we are doers, we are
deciders.  Once the decision is clear, the doing becomes effortless, for then the
universe supports and empowers our action.
<p>
Receiving <em>Eihwaz</em>, you are put on notice that, through inconvenience and discomfort,
growth is promoted.  This may well be a trying time; certainly it is a meaningful one.
So set your house in order, tend to business, be clear, and wait on the Will of Heaven.
<p>
(This is not the first time I&rsquo;ve been counseled &ldquo;patience.&rdquo;
&ldquo;do not be overly eager to press forward&rdquo; &ldquo;avert anticipated difficulties
through right action&rdquo;
&ldquo;once the decision is clear, the doing becomes effortless&rdquo;
&ldquo;wait on the Will of Heaven&rdquo;<br>
I hear <em>it is good and necessary that you plan and wait until the right time. </em> )
<p>
<hr>
<p>
Finally, the Course of Action Called For: <em>Sowelu</em>:
<p>
<em>Sowelu</em> stands for wholeness, that which our nature requires.  It embodies the impulse toward self-realization
and indicates a path you must follow, not from ulterior motives but from the core of your individuality.
<p>
Seeking after wholeness is the Spiritual Warrior&rsquo;s quest.  And yet what you are striving to become in actuality is what, by nature,
you already are.  Become conscious of your essence and bring it into form, express it in a creative way.  A Rune of great power,
making life force available to you, <em>Sowelu</em> marks a time for regineration down to the cellular level.
<p>
Although this Rune has no Reversed position, there is reason for caution.  You may see fit to withdraw, or even to retreat in the
face of a pressing situation, especially if events or people are demanding that you expend your energy now.  Know that such a retreat
is a retreat in strength, a voyage inward for centering, for balance.  Timely retreat is among the skills of the Spiritual Warrior.
<p>
<em>Sowelu</em>counsels opening yourself up, letting the light into part of your life that has been secret, shut away.  To accomplish this
may call for a profound recognition, for admitting to yourself something that you have long denied.
<p>
There is a prayer, known as the <em>Gayatri</em>, that embodies the spirit of the Rune of Wholeness.  Address the sun in this fashion:
<blockquote><em>
You who are the source of all power,<br>
Whose rays illuminate the world,<br>
Illuminate also my heart<br>
So that it too can do Your work.<br>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
While reciting the <em>Gayatri</em>, visualize the sun&rsquo;s rays streaming forth into the world, entering your heart, then streaming out from
your heart&rsquo;s center and back into the world.  This is a powerful and life-enhancing payer.
<p>
There is a caution here not to five yourself airs. Even in a time of bountiful energy you are required to face and vanquish your refusal to let
right action flow through you.  Nourish this capacity, for it is a mark of true humility.
<p>
Practice the art of doing without doing: Aim yourself truly and then maintain your aim without manipulative effort.  Meditate on Christ&rsquo;s words:
<em>I can of mine own self do nothing</em> (John 5:30).  For by our own power we can do nothing: Even in loving, it is Love that loves
through us. This way of thinking and being integrates new energies and permits us to fow into wholeness, which is the ultimate goal of the
Spiritual Warrior.</p>

<p>(Holy cow. Since August, I have been planning to attend a New Warrior Training weekend in November 1997.
This weekend allows opening of the heart and digging up old crap and getting that stuff out so it can leave
your being or be properly expressed!
I hear <em>Continue living the path of the heart; it&rsquo;s challenging, but you can do it.</em> )

Today the president of the corporation that owns my company is coming to visit. They put up a big sign, hollerin&rsquo; a &ldquo;Big Texas Howdy!&rdquo;
<br>
gag me.
<p>
I showed off my project to Leila, who said it looked really good and she was quite pleased and impressed. Yay! She&rsquo;s a manager or something over the group that will be using the application, so I was glad she liked it.
<p>
I worked on <em>The Past Is Now</em>, my novel for a couple hours today. I made the chapter called &ldquo;Androids&rdquo; available, and shaped up a few of the other chapters.
<p>
I goofed around on <a href="https://www.backpackers.com">
www.backpackers.com</a> for a while today, and found that there
are people traveling all the time!!!  Me too!! me too!! me too!!
I wrote to a guy here in Houston who plans to trek from Houston to Anchorage Alaska starting in May 1998.  Wow.  That&rsquo;s a bit too soon; I&rsquo;m planning my quest starting in August, but I wrote to him to see if I can get some tips from him.<br />
<p>
Tonight I&rsquo;m going to install DOS and Windows for a guy who is not entirely computer literate yet. I enjoy being able to help others. Plus it makes the days go by faster so August 1998 will come sooner. I&rsquo;m crazy, I know.

                        <p class=date>29 September 1997</p>

<p><p>
This past weekend I met with the rest of the district YAC and Marc Loustau for our Summit pre-planning meeting. We completed all our goals and had a great time to boot. Marc&rsquo;s knowledge and experience proved to be a great asset to our cause.
<p>
We met at Horizon Church in Carrollton, TX. Jason Fricke and I drove up there together. Well, I drove, and he offered to drive anytime I got tired. Heh. He played some of his CDs, indoctrinating me in various forms of punk rock, from ska to 3rd wave ska, and 3rd wave punk, and some old school punk. I enjoy learning all the terminology.. I wonder if I&rsquo;ve got it right. ;)
<p>
I called Annette, our contact person with the key to the church as we passed the exit to Mars, south of Dallas. I told her that some of the youth were probably gonna be there soon, or may already be there, so she left her house to meet us at the church with the key.
<p>
The high-energy rally-induced excitement filled the church as we greeted everyone with hugs and happy energy. And it wasn&rsquo;t even a rally!
<p>&ldquo;Tia! I brought all my nine inch nails CDs!&rdquo;  We had wanted to compare collections for quite a while. (Our collection of Halos is pretty much the same, although she has an import version of halo four, and I have the mini disc version of halo five. She had several more bootlegs than I do, but we have a couple bootlegs in common.)
<p>
&ldquo;Bryan! I brought Vanilla Ice!&rdquo; For some crazy reason, we both love beatboxin&rsquo; &ldquo;Havin&rsquo; a Roni&rdquo; from this CD. We did it for the talent show at SWUUSI, and Arlene (I think) brought a picture from that night.
<p>
Once crazy happy energies had stablized, I left for DFW airport to pick up Marc Loustau from the youth office, and Tera Little, who flew in from Arkansas. DFW is <em>huge</em>!! There is an 8 lane highway that flows between all the terminals with enormous signs indicating arrival flights and times. It&rsquo;s well labeled; I was able to drive straight to where Tera and Marc had just walked outside to meet me. I didn&rsquo;t see them, though, but I heard &lsquo;em.
&ldquo;ROB!!&rdquo; I stopped and looked back and yay Marc and Tera!
<p>
They tossed their junk in the back of the truck and off we went back to the church. I mis-anticipated the direction I would have to turn to go back north, so &ldquo;whuups!&rdquo; as I halted traffic for a bit to drive across a lane of traffic and a curb to get to where we needed to be.
<p>
Marc was all, &ldquo;!!!  well, I guess this is a truck!&rdquo; They must not have pickup trucks in Boston.
<p>
Tera and Marc mostly just talkity talked the whole way to the church, where the youth bounced up to greet us as we arrived.
Big hugs were given all around, and everyone finally met Marc who we&rsquo;ve been expecting since early September or so.
<p>
That first night we just played and ate pizza that someone ordered.
<p>Tera, Melissa and I went to get groceries for the weekend. Coolest things there were stickers advertising Melissa Brand squash of various types. I asked the manager dude if he had some extra stickers in the back. He did not, but said I could take a couple off the squash. I grabbed one off the spaghetti squash, and the brightly colored turban squash.
I thought it was great fun to get the manager to look for stickers for me!
<p>
Oh, and I tossed two 12-packs and a 2-liter of SURGE into the cart. Yum.
<p>
At midnight or so, after Arlene and Aaron arrived, we had a worship led by Marc and Austin. We started by each lighting a candle and bringing to the group the skills and/or energy of one person who was not present. Then we each wrote on paper our goals for the weekend, and drew a visualization of two of the goals. Then we had a hand creme finger orgy: <br>
<blockquote>eyes closed, everyone reaches into the middle of the circle and grabs someone else&rsquo;s hand. Then turn palms up and Marc dribbled hand lotion onto our palms. We wiggled and squirmed our fingers together for what seemed like several minutes with our eyes closed. That was a cool worship activity I had never done before.
</blockquote>
<p>
After that we mostly just stayed up and talked until people crashed asleep between 2:30 and 4am.
<p>
At 8am I woke up. Melissa was already awake; we went outside to share the bright sunshine and cool dew covered grass. I only remember talkin&rsquo; about her minister, but I don&rsquo;t really remember what about.
<p>
People started waking up and we got to work around 10am I think. We looked through all the bylaws of other districts, took the best parts from each of those and broke up into small groups and just got a lot of shit done. We played frisbee and took quick energy breaks to get blood pumping again, but mostly we worked diligently. I won&rsquo;t bore you with details, but the work was quite effective and rewarding.<br>
The funniest energy break started with the group in a circle with your left hand facing up toward the person on your left and your right hand facing down on the person-to-your-right&rsquo;s up turned palm.
Then your right hand makes a circular motion, first clapping against their palm, both of your own thighs, the bottom of your own hand then the top of your hand twice. This clapping made up a six beat human metronome as Marc began singing the words to Edelweise (sp).  But the <em>funniest!!!</em> thing was that Jason simply started clapping and snapping and then movin&rsquo; and groovin&rsquo; dancin&rsquo; a crazy dance as I laffed my ass off watching him and most everyone else hummed the words that we didn&rsquo;t know. Jason stopped when Marc stopped singing, &ldquo;c&rsquo;mon everyone sing!&rdquo; and we were like, &ldquo;we donno the words!&rdquo; and Marc started again and Jason immediately danced even crazier! I couldn&rsquo;t stop laffin&rsquo; he was so fuckin&rsquo; hilarious!!
<p>
We went to dinner at Arby&rsquo;s (cause we couldn&rsquo;t find anything better and the Frosty machine was broken at Wendy&rsquo;s) and then hung out in the back of the truck in Arby&rsquo;s parking lot for about 20 or 30 minutes. Crazy fun. Bryan Beck and I beatboxed and traded lines from DJ Jazzy Jeff and The Fresh Prince; Jason and I play fought while I stood on the side of the truck bed; everyone had a fun time just relaxing and stuff.
<p>
Back to work at the church we went, broke up into groups and got even more stuff done than we had expected to the entire weekend.
We were not quite as focused this time and by about midnight, some were getting kinda fiesty and gripey, but we were still struggling to get more finished.
<p>
Marc interjected: &ldquo;You guys have accomplished so much this weekend. Do you realize that we achieved all our goals before we went to dinner? You have grown together and bonded as a group like I&rsquo;ve never seen before. I suggest that we wrap it up for the night.&rdquo;
<p>
We all agreed. Jason goes, &ldquo;how about Bish Bish??&rdquo; Several people including I said naw, and then we were like, &ldquo;wait&hellip; there is absolutely no one else in the church&hellip;..&rdquo;<br>
I haven&rsquo;t chanted Bish Bish (maybe once) in the more than a year I&rsquo;ve been advisor. That night I shouted it like never before. Wow that felt great!!! (If yer goin&rsquo; &ldquo;what is Bish Bish???&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll have to ask me via email.)
<p>
After we cleaned up, everyone except Jason and Austin played Silent Football outside on the lawn. Marc was Dictator and he gave quite a different flavor to the game. Different motions and names and nearly random penance points awardance and it was crazy. For example, he gave us all <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> penance point for essentially no reason in the middle of the game. He was quite talkity while people were tattling, and he awarded points before people had even tattled on something. We still had great fun. (If yer goin&rsquo; &ldquo;what is Silent Football???&rdquo; Go to my &ldquo;friends on the web&rdquo; page.)
<p>
I stayed up talking to Marc for about an hour or so until like 2am and then talked until 2:30am to the youth in the kitchen who were making rice crispy treats for Tera&rsquo;s birthday (yay Tera!)
<p>
Then I slept until 7:30 and woke up to my beeper alarm. I played &ldquo;wish&rdquo; by nine inch nails really loud to get blood moving as we cleaned and stuff. After we had all cleaned up, most of us went in search of breakfast.
<p>
We ended up at McDonald&rsquo;s cause it was the only place open that early in the morning. The great thing was that Arlene climbed up the spiral tube of the indoor playground thing! We waved like proud parents to her crouched in the little room at the top, and then most of the youth climbed through it too. I actually did not; I was eating my salad and by the time I was done, some little kids were playing on it.
<p>
To the airport Tera and I drove with Jason and Marc sleepin&rsquo; in the back of the truck. I&rsquo;m glad they were sleepin&rsquo; because a cop was driving behind us for a couple miles. Eeeps!<br>
I stopped at the departure place corresponding to where I had picked up Marc and Tera 36 hours earlier. Big hugs were given and we looked forward to seeing everyone again at Little Rock Rally in December.
<p>
Jason and I drove home, engaging discussions on flag burning, abortion, drug use, and various genres of punk rock. As we were driving through Houston area, conversation turned to rock climbing and roller coasters and twisty flippy turning rides commonly seen in parking lot traveling fairs.
<p>
I said HI to Jason&rsquo;s mom and was too tired to figure out a problem she was having with a printer error she had on her computer. I went home and slept from 5pm till 7:30 am this morning.

Today I felt really bummed out at work and I just wanted to quit. That was actually my impetus for starting my previous journal entry. After getting nothing done almost all day, I talked to Dave my supervisor, who I&rsquo;ve known from back in the days since before he was a supervisor.
<p>
&ldquo;Grrr.&rdquo; I essentially said. That helped.
<p>
We talked a bit and I determined that I&rsquo;ve felt all bummed out and useless at work since my project deadline keeps getting set back(!) and I don&rsquo;t have the deadline pressure, so I just surf the web all day and feel like a lump.
<p>
I felt better and we set the deadline to tomorrow. Excellent.
<p>
On the way home, realizing having things to do keeps me moving and happy, I made a list and I&rsquo;m doing quite well at getting it all done tonight.

I&rsquo;m not totally sure what I&rsquo;m doing with this webpage; it&rsquo;s
been idle for a while.  I haven&rsquo;t been working on my novel, or writing Wild Skating Adventures, or out of body adventures, or
much of anything.
<p>
So what <em>have</em> I been doing?
<p>
I&rsquo;ve been working at work as a professional programmer, but that is not what I want to do all my life.  (More on that in a second)
<p>
I&rsquo;ve been an advisor for high school youth in my district. I love it. The work is absolutely rewarding; it&rsquo;s the one part of my life where I feel like I&rsquo;m actually making a difference in the world. The youth love me and I do everything in my power to help  their spiritual, emotional, physical growth. I love them all dearly.
<p>
This weekend the YAC members are meeting at Horizon Church in Carrolton, Texas.  We are planning for our Summit meeting in mid-October. This is the first lock-in this new YAC has experienced; I expect it to be quite fun and productive.
<p>
Jason Fricke and I are driving up from Houston tomorrow, picking up the key to the church from my friend Carrie Bruce and then I&rsquo;ll drop off Jason at the church so we can let everyone (who has  arrived) in. I&rsquo;ll go to DFW airport where I&rsquo;ll pick up Marc Lousteau and Tera Little. Then back to the church and the weekend begins. Yay!
<p>
Right now as I type this at work, I am listening to nine inch nails remix version of &ldquo;perfect drug&rdquo; as loud as my little CDRom headphones will let me. Nice, but I would like it louder.

As of earlier this month, I became totally debt free.
Well, except for a $4000 medical bill that I still owe as a result of Wild Skating Adventure Six, totally debt free.
<p>
I&rsquo;m a financial anomaly in this society!
<p>
As for the 4 grand, I&rsquo;m probably not going to pay it off really fast- just pay several dollars per month to keep &lsquo;em off my back. Instead, I&rsquo;m saving up all my dollars for my Extended Remix Roadtrip that will begin in about August 1998.  (God that seems so far away!!!)
<p>
I&rsquo;m going to purchase a vehicle and new skates and a new bicycle and camping gear and a small tent or maybe just a sleeping bag tent thing (whatever they are called) and I&rsquo;m going to drive around, half camping, half staying at friends&rsquo; houses and stuff.
<p>
At this point, my trip is only in the planning stages. I have an itenerary sketched out: start in Houston, go up to Tomball to see my dad, then to College Station to see my mom, then maybe to Austin to see my step sister Karina, who I&rsquo;ve known since long before our respective parents met.
Then up to Garland to see Carrie and then through Denton to say HI to Tamara.  Then through Oklahoma City and Tulsa over toward Springfield Missouri and then Jonesboro and Little Rock Arkansas.  Probably through Hot Springs Arkansas to check out the hot springs.
<p>
Then over to Radcliff Kentucky where I was born and then to Flat Top, West Virginia to see my dad&rsquo;s family, and probably park it there for the winter.
<p>
In the spring I&rsquo;ll emerge and probably drive west along the northern states (gotta go by Great America and that park in Sandusky (?) Ohio to ride The Raptor) and then swing down through Columbia, Missouri where I lived for 4 years, then to Colorado to see my friend Rocky (really that&rsquo;s his name) and then my brother in Las Cruces, New Mexico (if he&rsquo;s still attending school there).
Otherwise I&rsquo;ll just check out the latest craziness in Roswell.
<p>
Then check out the Grand Canyon and then Joshua Tree California and then to seem my friend Jen in Palm Springs.  Then San Francisco area and maybe I&rsquo;ll park it there for a while.
<p>
Now all of this is quite up for change at any minute.  That&rsquo;s the beauty of being free!!!!
