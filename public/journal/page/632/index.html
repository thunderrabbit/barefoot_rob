<p><p>Awright, so I was wrong about the location of the house.  It&rsquo;s not two
blocks behind my street, but two blocks behind and 10 blocks toward
downtown of my place.  This house is one of about 10 old old old houses
with huge condos going up all around them.  The houses are a bit too much
in the hood for me to feel safe there.</p>

<p><p>We did drive around and grab other flyers and stuff, though not as close
to my current residence as Wende and I want.</p>

<p><p>Talked to Diane yesterday, who gave me the overview of home purchase..
what I need, pros and cons, how to get best value.. that kinda good stuff.
 She&rsquo;s going to check me and Wen&rsquo;s credit now to see if anything
interesting is lurking there.</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>Yesterday evening, Maggie, Molly, John, Will and I all collided over at
Wende&rsquo;s house to hang out and play. We ate at Star Pizza, much to the
entertainment of us and the hopeful entertainment of Diana, our waitress.
 Back to Wende&rsquo;s we played the 7 Game and then a game of Dead Fish.  John
and Will left to play Ultimate; I was too tired and stayed back.  Wende,
Maggie and I played Scrabble using Molly sleeping on the floor as a table
for the game.</p>

<p><p>We were all pretty sleepy by the time the game ended.  The girls went
home and me and Wende crashed.</p>

<p><p>Heh.  That&rsquo;s funny.  I just realized I wrote February for the previous
entry instead of March.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m at work now, designing a desk addition thing that will allow me to
clear of the cluttery crap from my desk.  Papers, books, pictures, hard
drive, fork, plate, water bottles, grocery bag, CDs, glue stick, floppy
disks, telephone, binder, tools, paper paper paper all clutter my desk now.
 I believe that if I had more place to put it all, I could keep the desk
surface less covered in crap so I could actually use my desk for things
like writing or coloring or something.</p>

<p><p>With help from my dad, I&rsquo;ve got a design for a shelf thing using one
sheet of <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inch plywood.  I&rsquo;ll have to carefully plan the shelf so I can
get it all cut and stuff at Home Depot and then just put it together here
at work.  We&rsquo;ll see how that goes!</p>

<p><p>Today Wende and I are likely to see Whole Nine Yards again!  This time
with Maggie-Molly-John-Will.</p>

<p><p>Wende and I are looking to purchase a house.  We thankfully set the
intention this morning to easily find a lovely house with 2 bedrooms
and big kitchen and living room for $900 per month.</p>

<p><p>Wende made an appointment yesterday to look at a large 2 bedroom
apartment for rent.  We looked at it today and it&rsquo;s definitely nice,
but definitely $1050 per month.  Also we&rsquo;d only be renting.</p>

<p><p>So I called my lovely and talented friend <a
href="https://www.dianeperry.com/">Diane Perry</a> this morning.  She
hopped onto the &lsquo;net, found a house 2 blocks from my apartment for
$115k.  3 bedrooms and bath and it&rsquo;s open for showing now.  Wende is
at work; I&rsquo;m going to go now to check it out.  Then Diane is going to
re-look at it with me at 2pm.  Hopefully Wende can take lunch and see
it with us.</p>

<p><p>Wow!  Awesome!  Dude is going to go look at it with me now.</p>

<div class="dream">
I just woke up from a dream where I was living in a house with
several people that I didn't really trust, and I found a gun left
carelessly under a desk.  I had to sneak away to call the police and
explain to them the situation but I couldn't call 911 because the
phone was triggered to alarm if 911 was called so I had to call the
non emergency police number, but I couldn't look it up.  I finally
guessed the number after tons of tries and then I woke up as I was on
hold waiting for them to answer...
</div>

<p>I&rsquo;m just writing to express lovely gratitude that my life is so
much simpler than this dream!  I woke up feeling thankful to be in my
waking reality!!</p>

<p class=date>3:11am CST Friday 3 March 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Five minutes ago, as I was reading about various <a
href="https://www.seds.org/billa/tnp/hypo.html">hypothoses</a> of our
solor system, police cars began screaming past my apartment at full
siren and full acceleration.  I stepped outside to watch them.  Within
a 3 minute span no fewer than 9 cars blasted by, the last 4 or 5
without siren, but still at full accleration.</p>

<p><p>Out of sight, their wailing sirens were still faintly audible,
reminding me of coyotes howling in the movies.  (I&rsquo;ve never
experienced coyotes howling in real life.. Oh wait yes I have a few
times at my dad&rsquo;s house)</p>

<p><p>I believe I heard the distinct blare of a hook-and-ladder fire
engine within the faint din.</p>

<p><p>I pondered ways to see what was up:
<li>Jump in my car and chase them.
<li>Call 911 and ask &ldquo;what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;
<li>call the non emergency number and ask what&rsquo;s up
<li>flag down the next cop that tries to drive past
<li>flag down the wrecker that is driving past now
<li>turn on news radio KTRH
<li>somehow fly over the city for an aerial view</p>

<p><p>None of the options appealed, except for radio or flying, but KTRH
is broadcasting Art Bell, and I don&rsquo;t think I can easily fly over the
city.</p>

<p><p>brb</p>

<p><p>Okay, I just stepped back outside and I can no longer hear sirens.
The mysterious event must be under control.  It&rsquo;s 3:29am.</p>

<p class=date>9:01pm CST Thursday 2 March 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Today I basically worked all day.  Woke up crazy early and decided therefore to do laundry!!  Two great things about that:</p>

<p><p><ol>
<li>My laundry is now complete!
<li>I found Wende&rsquo;s Sacagawea dollar!
</ol></p>

<p><p>I had left her new dollar coin in my shorts pocket.  Now we know
what they will look like after a nice laundering.  Not brilliant
shiny, but still golden in color.  Very nice.</p>

<p><p>So inspired was I about the coin that upon arrival at work, I
visited <a href="https://www.usmint.gov">www.usmint.gov</a> and
purchased two 1999 Susan B. Anthony proof coins, and two 2000 proof
sets, including all the quarters from this year!!!  Wait&hellip; 2000 or
1999 proof?  Hmmmm.. now I don&rsquo;t remember.</p>

<p><p>Oh well.  Anyway, I ordered lots of cool coins!</p>

<p><p>I was anti-impressed with the shopping cart on their site.  It kept
erroring when I tried to add items to the cart, so I called customer
service and ordered over the phone, asking them to waive the S/H fee
that they wanted to charge since it was not a web-based order.</p>

<p><p>After that I work work worked on SAS stuff, the primary language
used at my work for database stuff.  It&rsquo;s a somewhat sloppy high level
language, but is fairly effective for what we need to do.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m picking it up pretty easily I think.</p>

<p><p>Wende and I munched at Subway and that&rsquo;s been the most excitement
I&rsquo;ve had all day!</p>

                        <p><title>KTRU Leap Year Croquet</title>
<p class=date>1:52am CST Wednesday 1 March 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Just got back from KTRU Croquet.  This year was Leap Year Croquet, where people were invited to dress up as frogs, which no one did.  Holly wore a lovely blue gown and Travis had on a weird purple suit thing.  Mondro wore a hard hat.  I wore shorts and tanktop and no shoes.  But I always wear that.</p>

<p><p>Before the game really started, we were visited by four naked people, scampering around campus.   They actually wore shaving cream, which didn&rsquo;t cover much.  3 guys and 1 girl.</p>

<p><p>Back to the game.. we got off to a normal enough start, but after not too long, Meg and Rick started cheating and just wacking their croquet ball without waiting for the other teams to get their turns.  Chaos reigned as people playfully wrestled for position to wack balls around the court.</p>

<p><p>After the game was mostly over, I talked to Lizzie, who asked me about Wende.  I told her the proposal news and she was quite excited!  I was still playing it down, but I appreciate her enthusiasm; it helped me be able to tell other people.</p>

<p><p>The game and group split up, and I joined several peeps to the station to say HI to DJ Chicken George, who Wende actually knows from when he went to school.  He asked about her and I was able to more easily tell him the news.  He gave me his email address to give to Wende.</p>

<p><p>Home and now I&rsquo;m gonna send out The Feel Good Net!</p>

                        <p><title>Eye Exam</title>
<p class=date>3:58pm CST Wednesday 1 March 2000</p></p>

<p><p>KTRU was fun today, but not stellar or even spectacular music-wise.
I did play two pretty cool songs - one jungle and one almost blues
tune.  My mom called during my radio show to congratulate me and
Wende!  She saw my marriage news in The Feel Good Net.  I put on a
long song and we talked for about 10 minutes while it played.</p>

<p><p>Walking back to my car after the KTRU meeting, I got a chunk of dry
ice!  A guy was unloading dry ice from a truck, and a little piece
broke off.  He said, &ldquo;be careful&rdquo; as I stretched my shirt out to make
a carrying sack for it.</p>

<p><p>I dropped off a piece at my work and took the rest with me to my
eye doctor appointment.  It sublimed slowly throughout my appointment,
and very quickly when we placed it in a coffee cup of water.  Fun fun
stuff!</p>

<p><p>My eyes are still all dialated after my eye exam.  I hadn&rsquo;t been
examined for 2 years; certainly it was about time to do it!  My vision
has changed a teeninsey bit, but not much.</p>

<p><p>I think I will check my email then take nap.   Or just take a nap.</p>
