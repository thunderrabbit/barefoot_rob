<p class=date>8:19pm CDT Sunday 27 August 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Today Madison and I saw <em>Bless The Child</em>, which opened this
weekend.  We both agreed that it wasn&rsquo;t as scary as we expected..
there was some suspense, but not a lot.  The computer animation was
really good; they animated a roomfull of rats (twice) and some creepy
flying gargoyles a few times.</p>

<p><p>Most of the violence was implied, though several photographs of
apparent arm mutilations were shown.  The scene of needle going into
arm looked quite real.</p>

<p><p>The lead bad-guy character was quite creepy.  I thought he was well
cast into the role (I don&rsquo;t know the actor&rsquo;s name) because his gaze
with one eye barely off kilter made him look just a bit icky.  The
character&rsquo;s personality changed from silky smooth to enraged psycho in
a blink.</p>

<p><p>I wonder if Holliston Coleman (our 7 year old hero) will see the
movie and end up in psychiatric hospital like the girl on
<em>Exorcist</em>.  Oh - that reminds me.. one of the trailers before
the movie is for an extended remix version of the original
<em>Exorcist</em>, with digital audio and scenes added that were cut
from the original movie.  It looked quite a bit scarier than <em>Bless
The Child</em>.</p>

<h1>Daytrip to Port Aransas</h1>

<p><p>As I drove us into the parking lot of the grocery store, &ldquo;do you need my
help keeping you on track getting the right stuff in the store?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Wende&rsquo;s all, &ldquo;do <em><em>I</em></em> need your help?  Do you want any input on
what we get?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Naw I trust your opinion.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I pulled up to the front door.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not ready to get out yet!&rdquo;  Wende exclaimed, looking for a place to
drop the stuff she was holding.  &ldquo;My shoes aren&rsquo;t even on yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wende, you&rsquo;re so particular.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Putting on her shoes, &ldquo;Yes.  And if you&rsquo;re just realizing this&hellip; welcome
to reality.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just going to go park.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No!  I&rsquo;m almost done putting on my shoes.  Then you&rsquo;d be in trouble the
opposite way.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>hahahah!  I love Wende.   <em>I&rsquo;d be in trouble the opposite way.</em>
That&rsquo;s so cute!!</p>

<p><p>She got out; I parked, grabbed my Handspring Visor and found Beastie Boys
<em>hello nasty</em> CD!  Yay Wende for packing it!!</p>

<p><p>At first I thought we had blown out her speakers; they were kinda
vibrating.  But I think actually they are just loose and shaking in their
mounts.  We probably just need to screw them in.</p>

<p><p>- - - - - -</p>

<p><p class=date>10:14 am</p>

<p><p>We just took a picture of a teal convertable Mustang with a license plate
that said &lsquo;KARINA&rsquo;.  We also just crossed the Brazos river.</p>

<p><p>- - - - - - -</p>

<p><p class=date>10:512</p>

<p><p>we saw cotton!  we&rsquo;re having a fight about if it&rsquo;s trash or cotton.  and
about metyping while drivign.</p>

<p><p class=date>10:59am</p>

<p><p>We just stopped by a big field of cotton.  Gross images of slavery were
going through my head: people being forced to pick cotton all day with no
shade or anything and shaded assholes watching and whipping.</p>

<p><p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s pretty cool to me to see big cotton balls (Wende said they
are called bolls in the fruit-thing)  and it just is cotton.  100% natural
cotton.  wow!</p>

<p><p class=date>11:55am</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;re in Victoria getting gas at Exxon for $1.39 per gallon!  It&rsquo;s an
average of $1.53 per gallon in Houston.  The best part about it is that I
went to <a href=https://gasoline.priceline.com>gasoline.priceline.com</a> and
tried to get it for $1.40 per gallon but my offer was not accepted.</p>

<p><p class=date>12:11pm</p>

<p><p>We don&rsquo;t have a map and I remembered from talking to Bob to take 187 =
85, or 185=87, but they&rsquo;re not the same.  Doh.  Wende just asked.</p>

<p><p class=date>2:36 pm</p>

<p><p>We got to zip across the <em>short</em> ferry crossing thing and only 20 cars
per ferry could fit.</p>

<p><p>We made it to the beach!  Even as we exited the ferry, we were pretty
much lost and followed cars and got pushed around by a <b>Right Lane Must
Turn Right</b> sign.  Scrounging  for change to get an umbrella.  The sun is
pretty scorching bright although it&rsquo;s only 89 degrees out according to
Wende&rsquo;s truck&rsquo;s thermometer.   Wende couldn&rsquo;t even flirt him into accepting
a smaller deposit.  I guess that&rsquo;s his job..</p>

<p><p>Woohoo we got an umbrella!!</p>

<p><p class=date>6:13 pm</p>

<p><p>Well we found a spot not too far from Mr Umbrella Guy and planted our
umbrella theres.  We put on sunscreen in the air conditioned car since
otherwise it was immediately sweating off.  Ate tunafish sandwiches, then
swam (I wanted to go deeper and Wende didn&rsquo;t want to get salt on her eyes)
then I dug a big hole on the beach while Wende slept on a towel.  Her
stomach hurt; maybe from the tuna, (but my stomach is fine).</p>

<p><p>I started the hole with a teeny scoop with a plastic spoon.  The spoon
soon broke and I just dug with my hands.  The sand here is much finer than
at Galveston.  I wonder why that is.  I kept digging and digging and ended
up sitting in this big gloppy hole of sand alternately full of water and
gloppy sand-water.  I slung glushous gloopy sandy splashes everywhere around
me.  Glooshed a layer of sand on my shoulders and back to keep them from
getting burned.  A few people commented and one woman asked what I was
doing.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to get all the water out of this hole!&rdquo;  She laughed,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got some bad news for you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>As the hole caved into itself and I kept slinging gushy glooshes, I ended
up in a hole about 10 inches deep and 3 feet in diameter.  That&rsquo;s almost 6
cubic feet of sand!</p>

<p><p>We have returned the umbrella and are parked near the shower-house thing
where Wende is taking a shower. Right at this moment I am watching 2 cars
stuck in some soft sand: a white Camaro driven by a squealy blonde and a
low-ish rider truck.  A testosterone (she&rsquo;s a fake blonde)  a testosterone
filled young man with tall truck drove through quickly then wheeled around
to push the low rider truck out.   The Camaro has been pushed out with the
help of several men.  Now it appears that the big truck is even stuck and so
there are two trucks in a row in the sand with 15 people around.</p>

<p><p>Here comes another low rider with hip hop bumping.. but he went around
through the parking lot where many people have kept from getting stuck.</p>

<p><p>Toyota truck.  parking lot</p>

<p><p>Dodge truck.  parking lot</p>

<p><p>F150 pickup..  parking lot.</p>

<p><p class=date>6:17 pm</p>

<p><p>They&rsquo;re still stuck.  Easily 20 people standing around.</p>

<p><p>Oh my gosh a 3rd truck is now in front of the origninally stuck truck
trying to pull them out.</p>

<p><p>jeep made it past them in the sand.</p>

<p><p>Wende&rsquo;s cellphone just rang but I couldn&rsquo;t find it in time.</p>

<p><p>3rd truck pulled the 1st truck out among some clapping.</p>

<p><p>Now 2nd truck is&hellip; stuck..  ah, no three guys is all it took to push him
out.</p>

<p><p>clouds of sand being tossed up.</p>

<p><p>such fun on the beach.  Ford F150 made it through.</p>

<p><p>Two Chevys made it through - one each direction.</p>

<p><p>Mitsubishi truck went around.</p>

<p><p>Now blonde and her friend are recovering her Camaro that was actually
pushed backward out, so they still have to go back past. maybe she&rsquo;ll go
around.    She just exclaimed &ldquo;party at our place!!&rdquo; to her friend.</p>

<p><p>Toyota Tacoma  made it through.</p>

<p><p>Blonde Camaro bumping music and she&rsquo;s using the parking lot.  smart girl.</p>

<p><p>Red Chevy spinning his wheels determined not to get stuck.. he&rsquo;s stuck.</p>

<p><p>reversing  spinning.. spinning sand spray</p>

<p><p>Toyota used the parking lot</p>

<p><p>red truck more sand more sping  forwards now
<br>backwards now spinning spinning spinning  stopped.  forward spinning
spinning spinning he made it through.</p>

<p><p>Van sizing it up..  parking lot.</p>

<p><p>Mercedes&hellip;  parking lot.</p>

<p><p class=date>6:25 pm</p>

<p><p>Here comes cute Wende tiptoeing through the sand to keep it off her
sandals.</p>

<p><p class=date>6:47pm</p>

<p><p>Back at the ferry.</p>

<p><p>Hmm.  They unloaded all the cars from &lsquo;our&rsquo; ferry, then put the gate back
down and didn&rsquo;t let us on.  It seems to just be sitting there.  Weird.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;re out of gas,&rdquo; I jokingly offer.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s 7 o&rsquo;clock, it&rsquo;s a shift change, they&rsquo;re like, forget you ugys we&rsquo;re
going home,&rdquo; suggestes Wende.</p>

<p><p class=date>6:50 pm</p>

<p><p>Now they&rsquo;re letting us on.</p>

<p><p class=date>6:56 pm</p>

<p><p>Cool!  we saw dolphins!!</p>

<p><p class=date>6:59pm</p>

<p><p>Wende&rsquo;s stomach hurts so badly she&rsquo;s crying.</p>

<p><p class=date>11:57pm</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;re home.</p>

<p><p>We visited her grandfather &ldquo;Paw Paw&rdquo; at his lovely little homestead in
Rockport.  He built the house in 1974.  I didn&rsquo;t see much, but we talked a
bit and Wende felt sick.  We had purchased Pepto Bismol, but it didn&rsquo;t seem
to be helping yet.</p>

<p><p>Paw Paw has a large longhorn bull named Aggie.  Nice.  Aggie was born in
1993.</p>

<p><p>Drove drove drove while Wende tried to sleep.  We got kinda lost on the
way back; I turned properly onto 85 or 87 or whatever, and saw a sign &ldquo;San
Antonio 140 miles&rdquo;   So I turned around and took Hwy 35 north.  I figured it
would go (of all directions) north and hit 59.  But no - it actually follows
the coastline pretty closely.  We took 35 to 71 and took that north to 59.</p>

<p><p>Before we got to 71, I stopped at a gas station for munchies and
directions from two old men talking by their truck.  They gave me great
directions to 71 and 59.  I second guessed them at one point and <em>almost</em>
turned around thinking I had passed my exit..  just as I was about to turn
around, I saw the overpass they said I would see just before 71.  Perfect.</p>

<p><p>I made it pretty far (maybe all the way to 59 (at El Campo)) but soon
thereafter I was getting sleepy and had to talk to Wende to stay awake.  She
was feeling somewhat better by then and listened to my stories and helped me
stay awake all the way into Houston.</p>

<p><p>What a great trip!!</p>

<p class=date>6:20am CDT Friday 25 August 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Lately, each time I type a dream, I stumble from our bedroom to the
study and start typing my dream.  Always with my eyes closed because
my right-hand brain is watching images of the dream in my head.  When
I watch the words, the pictures tend to fade because my left brain
takes over.  (that&rsquo;s my theory anyway)</p>

<p><p>The end result is that my typing is not perfect - missing letters,
extra letters, misplaced letters, etc&hellip;  After it was complete, I
would go back and tweak the whole thing and edit it into a reader
friendly format.  Today I am choosing not to do that.  The only thing
I have added is the HTML formatting that makes it appear green and
italicized.  (Yep, now is the time to upgrade your browser if most of
the text below is not green and italicized)</p>

<p><p>The blue &mdash;&mdash; lines are dream separations, jumping backwards to the
dream just before the one I typed.  So actually there are 3 dreams
below, with the first two at the bottom kinda related.  To the &mdash;&mdash;-
lines I added (previous dream) to remind you.</p>

<p><p>Last thing - the first dream that I typed (and the most recent one
I dreamt) is the most disjoint because my brain was still cloudy dream
mode when I started typing.  But here you go - my unedited typed
dream:</p>

<p><p class=dream>Why is Steve Kising Frank subtitle</p>

<p><p class=dream>Helping write an Internet chat room - ot just setting it up</p>

<p><p class=dream>We were on a highway or in the median of a higway with thousands of peple drivng by wo may want to chat about this subject</p>

<p><p class=dream>Late Night With Dick Why Isn&rsquo;t Dre Blu completed?</p>

<p><p class=dream>She was all, some people are useless?  Okay, Tony you interview  Mary  who me?  Some people are usueless</p>

<p><p class=note>&mdash;&ndash;(previous dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>Living in my old apartment about to go mow  some grass down the street for money, I mowed past some uys who were mowing a yeard but who didn&rsquo;t mow the slight dithc; I mowed it and then the mowere started to run out of gas so I went back to the apartment to fuel it up and somehow the gas tank was all full of air, but there was water on top of the gas tank like dripping into the tank was the air was sloshed out.   air pressure otherwise was keeping the water out.</p>

<p><p class=dream>  I dumped the water off the top of the gas tank and  then turned teh tank right side up again (the mow right side up) and some residual water poured right into the gas tal tank which had been caught in a tube.  A neighbor a couple of buildings down was all offering me advice on hsome random stuff..  Back&rdquo;  Back when I used tow ork for the oil company, we woul use ogs to blcok oil spills before they hit another oil pit and expoded&rdquo; or something equaly inane.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was all, &ldquo;um thanks&rdquo;  and then my closer but still not next door n</p>

<p><p class=dream>and then
tahnks and his next door neightbor was all, co was all coming down HI whats going on.. and then he aske  he interruped the oil-story guy with, &ldquo;where o  do you live again?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>I didn&rsquo;t know how they could be neightbors and not know who lived whwere but whatefer - it got the old story guy talking to him instead of bugging me.</p>

<p><p class=dream>There was all kinds of trash around, but lots of it was Bob&rsquo;s (wh lives nex doror to us now) and I didn&rsquo;t wantto throw it in the trash can in case he wanted to keep any of it.</p>

<p><p class=dream>There was a baby car seat  and lots of little aquarium rocks, including a pile that I had previously thrown away, and g and a bubble of water under the rocks (as if in a plastic bag, but not)</p>

<p><p class=note>&mdash;&ndash;(previous dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>Wende and I were getting married <em>today</em>  instead of in two years, but we had to wait for Eric and Meredith&rsquo;s ceremony  wedding to be  finished; we were scheduled to be married right fater them in the same location, which I think was our house.    Big big room  and there  their service started late, and we weren&rsquo;t ready yet anyway so that was fine.  fine.  My mom was there to officiate our wedding and I wasn&rsquo;t really nervous but I was totally  not prepared at all.  Just going to wing it or something.</p>

<p><p class=dream>My parents arrived and Maggie loudly greeted them at the ddoor even thought Eric and MEredith&rsquo;s wedding was going on and she may be interrupting it by talking, but she led them away from the wedding to   led us all away from the ceremony thing  to my old apartment and we were in the parking lot walking up the steps, but the door was locked so I had to go in first.  The huge blast trash can thing was in the kitchedn, blocking the path to get in,  so  . So Maggie was going to help me throw stuff awyay and cleear it out of the apartment.  I was all, wiait!  theres a  (phone book or someting) in the trash can; we don&rsquo;t want to throw it away.  but I had the feeling that  It was too far gone to get it.</p>

<h1>Fun Friday!</h1>

<p><p class=note>(noon Tuesday 29 August 2000&hellip;  I checked my age; I am
11115 days old today.  I thought, &ldquo;dammit! I missed my 11111th day; it
was on Friday.&rdquo; I told Karla and she reminded me that we celebrated it
with Fun Friday, but we just didn&rsquo;t know why we were celebrating.  I
love my higher self and helpful angels.  Thank you guys for helping me
celebrate my 11111th day even though I had forgotten it.)</p>

<p><p>Wow!  One of our clients sent us a big basket of goodies!!  Candy,
crackers, cheese, cheddar popcorn, microwavable roasted peanuts and cashews,
cashews, more cheese, strawberry cookies, peach cookies, sausage, cookies,
and more I&rsquo;m forgetting..</p>

<p><p><img src="/images/work/FSD/2000aug25_treats.jpg"></p>

<p><p>Karla has suggested that we have a lunch party and try to make cool
things with the cornstartch peanuts.  Wheee!!</p>

<p><p class=date>11:35am</p>

<p><p>Fun Friday is great!  I have a pic of the basket, but it&rsquo;s 270k and it&rsquo;s
certainly not <em>that</em> great of a picture..</p>

<p><p>Oh!  and that reminds me that my website recently filled its disk space
quota.  I&rsquo;ll contact my webmaster about price for more space.  I was able to
delete a significant amount of jpgs that I had for <a
href="https://www.blanketstoyou.com">Blankets To You</a> but I will still
need to recover some space I&rsquo;m sure.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m neearly done wiping clean my geocities site; I think I&rsquo;ll use it as
free storage of pics and stuff.. but it just bugs me that they won&rsquo;t be on
the same domain..  I therefore won&rsquo;t be able to perfectly copy everything in
one big pile if I move my site again.   But it sure has been a big project
to move my site here&hellip;  I hopefully won&rsquo;t be moving it again any time soon.</p>

<p><p>On the other hand, I can move my site and all the pointers will still
point to geocities and the images will still be there.  That will work.
Cool.</p>

<p class=date>1:17am CDT Saturday 26 August 2000</p></p>

<p><p>A few days ago I was talking to Jennifer our next door neighbor and
she gave me the great idea of driving down 59 south till we get to the
ocean and clear water.  The water in Galveston is not clear.  All
murky and dark bluh .. can only see a few inches through it.</p>

<p><p>So tonight I went over to their house to get more ideas on where to
go and stuff like that.</p>

<p><p>Turns out that 59 itself does not go to the ocean, but we can take
59 to Victoria and then turn south from there and visit &hellip;.. not
Corpus Christi.. is that it?  I&rsquo;m too tired.</p>

<p><p>Anyway, we sketched out a travel plan and then talked computers and
video games and cats (Bob playfully made his cat do kung fu fighting,
some turntablism, butterfly weights, etc in a most entertaining
manner) and shopping and other stuff I&rsquo;m sure.</p>

<p><p>Then we watched a bit of TV (Jay Leno then David Letterman, then
Gilligan&rsquo;s Island, and then <em>Return of The Fly</em>).  By then it
was 12:30 and Wende had just gotten home from work.  Wende and I ate
Taco Bell at our house and let Jeniffer and Bob go to sleep.</p>

<p><p>Tomorrow as soon as we wake up we&rsquo;ll go drive to Corpus!</p>

<p><p>Tonight after work Maggie and Roddrick both went to dinner with
Wende and I at House of Pies!  Rodd is Wende&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s husband, who
is in town for some work training classes.  Maggie is Maggie whose
husband is out of town for some work stuff.</p>

<p><p>Dinner was lovely and entertaining..  We started with talk of
Maggie&rsquo;s work and then a tiny bit about stocks, and then a lot of talk
about scary movies.  The scariest for Wende was <em>It</em> television
version from back in her college days.  For Rodd it was the ucky scene
in Misery, for Maggie Amittyville(sp) Horror.  For me it was The
Serpent and The Rainbow.  But I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve seen scarier and just not
remembering it.</p>

<p><p>Then back to our house; Rodd split immediately to sleep at his
hotel and Maggie came up to talk talk some more.  Talk ranged from
computers to stocks to work to movies.</p>

<p><p>Work was okay today.  Actually it was pretty fine compared to
yesterday and the day before.  I finished the latest requested changes
to my latest project; I almost feel like I&rsquo;m back on schedule with it
again.</p>

<p><p>We had an interesting data collection error yesterday.  A person
had filled out a survey and then went back to change the answers
(which is perfectly legal) and then was shocked when they found <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
their answers missing when they went in again.</p>

<p><p>What happened?  Well, on this survey, we have multiple [Save and Go
To #] buttons which will save the user&rsquo;s input and return them to the
screen at the next question.  While the survey had been previously
filled out, the person clicked Save and Go To <em>before</em> the screen had
loaded all the way.  Therefore the bottom <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> of the responses hadn&rsquo;t
been drawn to the screen, and therefore showed as blank when saved for
the second time.</p>

<p><p>I added a fix today.  I set a variable called pageLoaded to NOPE
when the page begins to be loaded.  When the page is loaded, I set the
value of pageLoaded to YEP.  Then when Save and Go To is pressed, the
button calls a function that checks the value of pageLoaded.  If it&rsquo;s
NOPE, a warning is given &ldquo;please wait..&rdquo; and if it&rsquo;s YEP, then the
page is saved.</p>

<p><p>Yay!</p>

<p><p>Absolutely terrible directions getting to this Allstate place.  The
claims adjuster read directions off their sheet and a critical bit of
information was missing:  which side of the street they were on, and the
detail that there is no fucking sign on the building.</p>

<p><p>So now I&rsquo;m here 6 minutes early despite the silliness.</p>

<p><p class=note>Dream:</p>

<p><p class=dream>Bryn in australia but flew to US for a rally and brought a
friend!</p>

<p><p>dangit I barely remember anything of the dream.</p>

<p><p>The car thing went fine today; I got a check for $497.01 and that&rsquo;s all
folks.  We can choose to sell the car, fix the car, not fix it.. whatever.
I&rsquo;d like to get Scott fixed; we can talk about it tonight.</p>

<p><p>Work was better today than yesterday; I finished my project.. But I only
finished by 7pm.. not as early as I had hoped.</p>

<p><p>Wende and I are going to munch dinner at Black Eyed Pea.</p>

<p><p>- - - - -</p>

<p><p>Black Eyed Pea was nice.  I had just a salad and mozarella cheese sticks
in the shape of stars.  There was a rave kid at a nearby table.  He was all
dressed with phat fat pants and lots of bright plastic necklaces and
bracelets and little spikey blonde hair like Calvin (of Calvin and Hobbes).
For some reason I found myself just watching him - so entrancing.  I don&rsquo;t
really know why.</p>

<p><p>An interesting point about the term &ldquo;rave kid&rdquo; &hellip; the youth was probably
15 or 16 years old, and I would definitely call him a youth.. but all the
youth I know lately call themselves kids, and I am guessing this youth may
call himself a rave kid.  But I never spoke to him, so I may be totally
wrong.</p>

<p class=date>5:05am CDT Monday 21 August 2000</p>
<p class=note>(dream)</p></p>

<p><p class=dream>I was totally a spy.  There had been a treasure buried
on the hull of a crashed airplane and the treasure was marked with a
rubber spy-vs-spy (from MAD Magazine) mask.  To get to the treasure,
one had to get the key from inside an elevator shaft, and to get the
key, one had to have a flashlight, and the elevator shaft was in a
fancy hotel somewhere far away from the airplane hull.</p>

<p><p class=dream>We road to the bus stop nearest the hotel in some
desert middle east seeming type of country, all bright blazing hot sun
and dusty sand with dry cracked rocks and mountains all around.
Straight out of Indiana Jones.  Everyone got off the bus and about 3
or 5 people knew about the key in the elevator shaft.  Somehow the bad
guy was on the same bus with us and a different spy had stolen his
flashlight.  I happened to have a flashlight disguised as a plastic
coke bottle (full of coke (actually Dr Pepper)) hidden in my cargo
shorts.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I got off the bus with the crowd and started walking
toward the hotel and Rick saw me walking that way and immediately
turned and walked ahead of me, but he was &ldquo;following&rdquo; me.  Rick was a
good guy.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Behind us we heard machine gun fire as the bad guy
tried to scare everyone into giving his flashlight back.  We kept
walking with intention as if we hadn&rsquo;t heard him.  As we were a few
hundred yards up the road, somehow the bad guy appeared somewhat
before us on the road and he had a chain saw.  He tried to scare the
crowd of people who were all innocent just to see who would freak and
he&rsquo;d know that person was the one who had stolen his flashlight.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I hadn&rsquo;t stolen it, but I knew who had, and I had a
different flashlight in my cargo shorts pocket.  The bad guy started
feigning toward individuals in the oncoming crowd, hoping to scare
someone.  People mostly ignored him as a nuisance.  He approached Rick
and put the chain saw against the back of Rick&rsquo;s neck, but didn&rsquo;t hurt
him.  Then the bad guy put the chain saw against the back of my neck.
I knew who this man was (from previous spy days?)  and he had a pretty
good intuition that I would know something, but I didn&rsquo;t let on.  He
grabbed my sheet that I was carrying and flung it open.  Nothing
concealed inside.  I was all, &ldquo;c&rsquo;mon, man; I&rsquo;m just trying to walk.&rdquo;
He brushed me again with the chain saw in a menacing manner, then left
me alone.</p>

<p><p class=dream>We had just arrived into the hotel at that point and
were walking through the hotel restaurant, and I had the coke-bottle
flashlight in my shorts pocket.  I didn&rsquo;t need it at this moment, so I
hid it in the little phone book cubbyhole of a pay phone on the wall.
I knew if bad guy came back, he wouldn&rsquo;t be so lenient and he would
search me more thoroughly.</p>

<p><p class=dream>We got into the elevator with the key hidden on it, and
didn&rsquo;t need the flashlight because the light was on in the elevator.
I looked out the elevator window and saw that the bad guy had gone down
a different elevator and I knew he would got down a floor or two,
walk over to our elevator, then press our elevator&rsquo;s button, causing
it to go down a floor or two where he could surprise attack us.  I
was pondering how to avert his action without pushing the STOP button
on the elevator, thereby bringing attention to ourselves.</p>

<p><p>And I woke up.  Whew!  Scary dream.</p>
