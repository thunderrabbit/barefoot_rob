<p>In Japanese かさ is pronounced "kasa" with "ah" for the 'a'
  characters like Spanish pronunciation of casa (house).  But in
  Japanese かさ means umbrella.</p>

<p>Okay.</p>

<p>I now know of one way <em>not</em> to ride a bicycle.</p>

<p>And I know of a quick way to stop a bicycle.</p>

<p>Would love to have gotten this on video.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>It happened so quickly that I had no time to recognize what
  happened before I was on the ground in a heap.  I don't even really
  remember the sequence... I guess, ah here it is: it happened so
  fast that there was none of this "it happened in slow motion" kinda
  stuff when my brain goes into hyper-processing mode and sees
  everything under the influence of lots of adrenaline (?).  It was
  more like, [ride ride ridsplat]</p>

<p><em>. . . woah. Three second internal check: anything broken?  No.
  any super sharp pain?  No.  Any dizziness?  No.  Any pain at all?
  yeah my wrist and my thigh.</em></p>

<p>By this time, maybe 5 seconds had gone by.  I realized I needed to
  move; I didn't want any Japanese trying to hover over me and me try
  to explain anything.  A woman came up, "だいじょうぶ?"  (are you
  okay?)  "はい okay です。"  ("why would you think I wasn't okay?
  Jeez how nosey can you be?")  And she nodded and walked off, which
  now I realize wouldn't have happened in Houston or Dallas; a
  passerby would have insured that the person wasn't just saying they
  were okay.. anyway whatever</p>

<p>I was a bit woozy (my head did not hit the ground) from having the
  wind knocked out of me (quite a strange term, and I wonder what the
  process really is and why it's so discombobulating) so I sat
  meditatively on the curb by my bicycle for a bit.  Just doing some
  more internal checks and allowing all my systems to reboot and
  settle.</p>

<p><em>This little delay means I'll be late.</em>  I checked the clock
  on my phone.  <em>Not too late, but late enough to let Miki
  know.</em></p>

<p><em>がんばって</em> ("buck up, buttercup") and I got up to
  continue my journey.  Then I saw what had happened.</p>

<p><a href="/images/travel/japan2003-2004/around_town/tsunashima/kasa.jpg"><img
  src="/images/travel/japan2003-2004/around_town/tsunashima/thumbs/kasa.jpg" align="left"></a> I'm
  really glad I took the time to get a picture and didn't just try to
  get back on schedule.</p>

<p>Systematically took the umbrella out of my spokes, folded it and
  put it in my bag for show and tell.  (Noted that as I had hung the
  umbrella from my handlebars, a little voice in my head had said,
  "hey jack, why don't you take a moment to put it in your
  backpack?"  <em>Thank you voice for your efforts.  Thank you angels
  for protecting me even after I didn't listen to you.</em>) In a
  great ego-driven show of hugeness, I did not look around at who
  might be watching me (just hoped a hundred people were) and jumped
  back on my bike and sped toward the station.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>In the station I called Miki to tell her I'd be late.  My phone's
  display didn't survive the incident (I checked the time on the outer
  display, which was fine); I was able to call her from redial, not
  from (my) memory.</p>

<p>On the train after my dismount, I remembered the book _Mutant
  Messenger Down Under_ (I think) and healing-vibed my arm to heal
  quickly.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Super duper thanks to みき for helping me navigate the ER.  No
  broken bones, but I'm now wearing a wrist brace (actually it's my
  old skate wrist guard).  No pain meds, but an adhesive topological
  thing called a しっぷ。</p>

<p>I got a copy of the X-rays (much to Miki's surprise) which I might
  photograph and publish.</p>

<p>We chowed at the ramen place on the corner of the buildings next to
  Gera Gera and then zoomed back to Kawasaki and sat in Starbucks for
  a bit before her flute lesson.  I got kicked out of Starbucks for
  not buying anything after a while and roamed around looking for a
  Vodafone shop to see if they'll replace my phone which got fucked up
  in my umbrella enabled bicycle dismount today.  *That*'s what
  bruised the crap out of my leg.</p>

<p>We sat (and I slept) a bit after getting some contraband food from
  the convenience store and then rocked into the movie.</p>

<p>After the movie, there were a lot of girls (and a few guys)
  wearing total goth clothes, with huge black tall high heels.  I
  wondered who the show could have been for - certainly not anyone
  that I've heard of (though I secretly wondered if I would be
  disappointed to find out who)...  it's a little band called Moi dix
  Mois.  I ain't never heard of them, but they's apparently a bit
  popular (at least in Japan) right about now.</p>

<p>Some of the outfits were rather cute, but man what a nightmare for
  walking in those shoes!</p>

<p>Walked Miki to her bus and went home.</p>

<p>Oh, ps.  I was approached by a guy from a hip hop clothing shop.
  I was like, "I'm not cool enough to wear these," though he of
  course assured me that I was.</p>

<p>I left with a black brand name knit cap.  Phat Farm.</p>

<p class=dream>I was talking to a guy and we had to use two words that
  had the same hiragana and make like a crossword puzzle with
  them.</p>

<p>There was more, but I read janette's ultra-super-emails before
  writing.  I don't remember.</p>

<p>Wow.  C-c C-v works on emacs now!</p>

<p class=date>7:58am</p>

<p>I remember more of my dream</p>

<p class=dream>I was living with some women roommates, including a
  Morag-energy and her roommate Lisa-energy woman.  Morag and I were
  past the sexual tension and were chilling (in the bathtub) together
  (with clothes on, in the water, but not soaked) and Lisa came in and
  offered to have sex with us and I was like "yeah" partially, but I
  knew it would be inappropriate so I was like, "naw," and then I
  realized it was a dream, so I was like, "yeah," but then it was too
  late.</p>

<p class=dream>My roommate left a mess in the restroom.</p>

<p>Yay no rain is scheduled for today!</p>

<p class=date>11:53pm</p>

<p>Whoo.</p>

<p>Tired.  tired.  My new roommate is so weird.</p>

<p>ともこ, ゆうこ and I had big fun at Tokyo Disneyland today.   I
  won't give a play by play; I'm too fucking tired for that.</p>

<p>My goldfinger got us permission to see the super show at the end
  of the day, but it was subsequently cancelled due to high winds.
  Silverfinger.</p>

<p>Space Mountain is closed due to some injury I guess.</p>

<p>Got a fastpass to ride Splash Mountain and then waited forty
  minutes for the Big Thunder Mountain minetrain.  That ride is well
  themed, has three lifts and lasts probably four minutes I'm
  guessing (including lifts).  The ride has little to no airtime, but
  the seats are quite loose with only one lapbar across two people at
  a time, giving plenty of wiggle room.  I could have stood up when I
  rode alone (but chose not to cause it was quite dark and I didn't
  want to risk a night in the hospital to prove I could do something
  I knew I could do) in the car, but instead just braced myself about
  8 inches off the seat for most of the ride.</p>

<p>We rode it twice.</p>

<p>Rode Splash Mountain twice as well.  It's half water half minetrain
  ride.  Actually 3/4 water.  I bought the picture the first time we
  rode.  That ride is (currently) themed with Brer Rabbit and friends
  Zip A Dee Doo Dah style with swampy critters playing banjos and
  singing and fishing.</p>

<p>We rode It's a Small World After All, a flat water ride going
  through different rooms with Disney's versions of different
  cultures' versions of Christmas.</p>

<p>Um, rode Star Tours, which was pretty good, but pretty short.  I
  was impressed with the themeing of that ride as well.  (original
  Star Wars trilogy theme) I couldn't tell how they made the ride
  move; we were basically in a moving box (I think!) but when we got
  out, it seemed pretty substantially connected to everything nearby.
  Interesting.</p>

<p>Oh, we went through a haunted house ride, and I was impressed with
  its ability to give large groups of people a show at a time.  3
  people per individually swiveling car, and we got on the cars while
  the train of cars was moving along the boarding area. Efficient and
  basically as safe as a moving sidewalk.  In the first elevator room,
  the pictures on the wall suddenly started stretching and it took me
  almost half a minute to see how that trick was done.  It looked
  really good. </p>

<p>We watched "Honey I Shrunk The Audience," which was pretty cute
  with quite realistic animation and included a huge dog sneezing on
  the entire audience.  (Sorry to give it away.) </p>

<p>Ate pizza at on a windy balcony area.  Yummy.</p>

<p>Ate 1700 yen dinner in a relatively nice restaurant.  After dinner
  we watched through the windows the Parade of Lights, featuring about
  15 Disney-themed floats, each coated in lights and starring
  animatronics, or (more often) people dressed as the characters from
  the various movies.  ともちゃん was able to more quickly and
  accurately identify the various stories/movies represented by the
  floats.</p>

<p>During dinner they gave me some Japanese to study and I gave some
  English to ゆうこね。</p>

<p>Oh, we rode the spinning tea cups only because I told them I would
  *not* spin it as fast as I could, but would in fact anti-rotate the
  cup so that we stayed oriented in the same direction through the
  entire ride.  That was nearly as fun and certainly required finer
  skills than spinning like Fred and I would have done.  Plus no one
  was sick afterward.</p>

<p>Took pictures in the Mad Hatter store (スーリやプオのきもの) and
  then bought some postcards in the overpriced gift shop.  I saw some
  slippers that I wanted to get for Wende.  I saw a plastic cookie tin
  that I wanted to get for janette.</p>

<p>I wondered a lot about what it would be like to work at TDL.  As a
  grounds sweeper (the place was really really clean (and, thank god,
  had very few smokers!)) or as an actor.  Could be fun.  Could be the
  start of my acting career.  (my what?)</p>

<p>Oh, we rode the Pirates of the Carribean ride, which ともこ said
  her uncle designed 20 years ago !!!!!  The ride has been here all
  this time and just recently re-themed in Pirates gear.  She said it
  was darker than before.  A baby cried while we were on the ride.</p>

<p>Overall, super fun time; I had great fun in the full attention of
  two women (as unavailable as we may all be) and learned a lot of
  Japanese and got to see TDL and laughed a ton; it was premium.</p>

<p>First lesson at work was pretty fun.  I was genki and students
  were generally laughing and having a good time.  Nice.</p>

<p>Not all the lessons were like that today, but mayyybe nearly half
  of them were.</p>

<p>Oh, after the first lesson, Ali had a hackey sack out and we
  started Kawasaki Haki Saki (かわさきはきさき).  Actually Tony
  started.  One must say, "this is an official attempt" and all
  attempts must be recorded on a piece of paper taped inside the
  teachers' room door.</p>

<p>Junko (the staff member most likely to (attempt to) say anything we
  tell her to say (such as "I like it went you call me big papa" and
  "Whatchoo talkin' bout foo?")) was in the room and I was like "Okay,
  Junko, turn toward me," and she was like "nani?" and I demonstrated
  a simple inside kick with the footbag and caught it in my hand.
  "Okay, do that." and she was like, "chigaw chigaw" and I'm like,
  "just kick!" and served the footbag to her and she kicked it
  successfully and then instantly said, "Bye! Bye!" and sped out of
  the room.  God bless Junko for putting up with us.</p>

<p>One of my lessons was a training given by Scott to Mike and me.
  When I had seen the training on the schedule I was like, "I
  don't <em>think</em> I'm in trouble..."  I wasn't.  That was
  nice.</p>

<p>And, actually, the ideas he gave us were pretty good.</p>

<p>During that lesson I glanced over Scott's shoulder to see if I
  could catch Miki's eye in the next room.  This is Miki Haneda, not
  KG Miki nor high school Miki.  I never did.  After that, before my
  last lesson, Guy asked Mike to join him in some pushups in the hall.
  I joined them.  I did 15 pushups and called it good.  Guy did 60
  straight and then did 10 more.  Mike did more than me and fewer than
  Guy.</p>

<p>After that, and before the lesson, I saw Kaori and Miki H chillin'
  next to the voice room.  I made sure that Miki knew I couldn't meet
  her tonight; that because I hadn't heard from her I had made other
  plans (to meet with KG Miki).  My last lesson was in the voice room:
  high school Miki, Keiko (level 3 or 4), and Wada (level 3) were
  there. Oh; I had had a lesson with Wada and a trial student named
  Naomi earlier.  It also went pretty well.  Scott gave me some almost
  unwanted advice for that lesson, but, again, (actually first), it
  turned out to be helpful.  I didn't do quite what he suggested, but
  I did use a variant of what he was talking about and that
  helped. . . . Voice was pretty cool; we talked about origami and
  then roller coasters (how do I so often talk about roller coasters?
  hmmmm) Then bing bong time to go.</p>

<p>Ali and I did some more かわさきはきさき.  Good way to end a
  good day.  Oh, but that wasn't quite the end</p>

<p>Phil and Ali and I went to a bar and had some drinks.  OJ for me
  and brewskis for they (brewskis??).  Ali tried to guess the name of
  the student with whom I'm going to TDL tomorrow.  I told him I'd
  give 1000 yen if he got it on the first guess and take off 100 yen
  for each guess after that.  Phil ended up guessing (though he didn't
  know the significance of the name) and I gave him 200 yen, which he
  put into a pot on the table.  Ali had us guess an Arabic name;
  Mussafa or something; and then Phil had us guess: I got Cedric after
  a couple guesses.  He told us it was an old English name that
  started with C.</p>

<p>We traded a few simple riddles and I knew all the ones Phil showed
  us.  Phil knew all the ones that I knew that I showed us (I couldn't
  remember the solution to</p>

<pre>
       There are 12 coins.  All the coins look identical.  One coin is
       fake and is either lighter or heavier than the other coins.
       The only way to discern the weight difference is with a
       balance which can be used only three times.  By what sequence
       of balances can one find the fake coin and know if it's
       heavier or lighter?
</pre>

<p>which Mr Reagh gave us in high school.  I think we solved the
  puzzle back then, but I don't remember the solution now) because I
  didn't show The Carpet Problem given to us by Mr Reagh.</p>

<pre>
       You have rectangular piece of carpet 12 by 9 feet.  Cut out a
       single rectangular 1 by 8 foot strip from the carpet.  Cut the
       remaining carpet into exactly two pieces so that they can fit
       together to form a square 10 by 10 feet.
</pre>

<p>Ali mostly gave up before solving any of the riddles.  Oh, but he
  did offer the get 4 units of liquid using a 3 unit and a 5 unit
  container riddle.</p>
 

<p>After that I went to hang out with KG Miki, who told me about her
  trying day at work with her mean boss.  Miki told her boss she wants
  to quit; she's quite torn up about it because she loves her job,
  just hates her boss.  She's going to talk to her (nice) boss
  tomorrow and try to explain the situation.  I encouraged her to get
  support from parents of the kids who like Miki as a teacher.  They
  can write letters and stuff.</p>

<p>Rocked home and here I am.</p>

<p><p><b>Comment:</b>
<br>Hi Rob.<br>
<br>
I know the answer to the coin riddle.  I can do 12 coins in 4 weighs (I can do it in three weighs if I know whether the coin is heavier or lighter.)<br>
<br>
Make the 12 coins into 3 groups of 4.<br>
First Set:<br>
Weigh 1:<br>
Group 1 vs Group 2 - case 1.1 - one weighs more - let&rsquo;s call it Group 1.<br>
Weigh 2:<br>
Group 1 vs Group 3 - case 1.11 - one weighs more - If Group 1, then Group 1 contains the bad coin and the bad coin is heavier.  I can&rsquo;t imagine Group 3 weighing more in this scenario.<br>
                   - case 1.12 - they weigh the same - Group 2 has the bad coin and the bad coin is lighter.<br>
Weigh 3:<br>
Take the group with the bad coin, put two of the coins against each other.  You either know have the heavier (if splitting Group 1) or the lighter (is Group 3) or they are even and you have to use a Weight 4 to take care of the last coins.<br>
<br>
Second set:<br>
Weigh 1:<br>
Group 1 vs Group 2 - case 2.1 - they weigh the same.  Therefore Group 3 contains the bad coin.<br>
Weigh 2: <br>
3 coins from Group 1 vs. 3 coins from Group 3 - case 2.11 - they weigh the same.  Therefore the coin not weighed in Group 3 is bad.<br>
                   - case 2.12 - they weigh differently.  Therefore, the bad coin is contained in the subset of three Group 3 coins.  If they weighed more, the coin is heavier, if they weighed less, the coin is lighter.<br>
Weigh 3: (if case 2.12)<br>
weigh two coins from the subset of 3 - case 2.121 - they weigh the same.  Therefore the third coin from the group of three is bad.<br>
                                     - case 2.122 - they weigh differently.  Based on the deduction of case 2.12 concerning whether the coin is lighter of heavier, the lighter or heavier is the bad coin.<br>

<p>I've realized that I'm enjoying work more as I get to know the
  students.  As I learn their names.  I memorized ともひろ and ひとみ's　
  names today.  It helped also when I kinda joked around with them
  and said, "どぞ" (please [speak]) to Tomohiro when he and I spoke at the
  same time.</p>

<p>It's like I'm gravitating more toward Ali's style of teaching; he
  seems to know a ton of students names and allows the classes to be
  fun and not necessarily serious.  I am beginning to let myself go a
  bit in that respect.</p>

<p>Some of the shit he says makes no sense; it's just him being
  silly.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Gave LU to a guy (ironically whose name I have forgotten) at the
  last lesson of the day.  7B to 7A.</p>

<p>Chose not to give my contact info to ゆみこ, even though had I had
  the identical lesson with her two months ago, I would have.  Less
  desperate for Japanese friends now.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Surfed internet for 3 hours instead of studying tonight.</p>

<p>d'oh.</p>

<p>Payday is in one hour and 25 minutes.</p>

<p>ゆみ has contacted me asking me to teach her again at Gateway 21.
  Sweet!  All of my private students have dropped off the map.  She's
  the first to hook it up again.</p>

<p>Today Olivia invited me to her birthday party in 綱島.  The timing
  was convenient for me so I came to the designated restaurant and
  saw a couple of gaijin there and was like, "hey do you know
  Olivia?" and they're like, "no" but I know one of the cats and he
  remembers me from working at Kawasaki and then he's like, "Oh,
  Olivia; yeah I met her, but we haven't seen any other gaijin
  here."  Turns out Olivia was downstairs with some peeps and I don't
  know how it all happened but they had just arrived kinda</p>

<p>ANYWAY I hung out with Phillip, Sarah & Kristen (roommates) for a
  while, chatted with them some.  Phillip is from New York; Sarah is
  from Christchurch (NZ), and Kristen is from Melbourne (OZ).  <!
  Sarah is engaged, but was quite touchy-feely with Phillip it seemed,
  so that was a bit weird to me. > We chatted, chowed a bit and
  laughed and I traded phone numbers with Sarah who invited me to hang
  with them for New Year's party.  We shall see.</p>

<p>Went down to Olivia's thing and found Morag & Karen (roommates),
  Olivia & Jen & Grace (roommates), Nina (?), あいこ(student), Lubo
  (me, Jen, Grace, Olivia's building), and かしひろ(?)  (some other
  Japanese guy that Olivia seemed to like a lot).  They had smuggled
  in some vodka and Olivia took a huge shot (2 ounces) and then
  offered shots to anyone within reach.  I had a sip and O and J were
  really happy about that.  (Oh, they've taken to calling me Robehts,
  with emphasis on the last syllable.)  Morag and I made "oh my gosh
  they are so drunking weird!" eyes at each other several times.  It
  was funny.</p>

<p>Turns out it is not Olivia's birthday.</p>

<p>At work, near the end of the day, a student was all, "HI" to me and
  I'm like, <em>you look familiar, but I've not seen you in a long
  time, ummmmmm,</em> "I'm sorry; I don't remember your name."</p>

<p>"ゆうこ。"</p>

<p>I still didn't remember it.   "Oh!  It's been a really long time
  since I've seen you!"</p>

<p>"Yes yes yeah do you know ともこ?"</p>

<p><em>Tomoko with whom I'm going to TDL on Tuesday? Don't get me in
    trouble here, please.</em> "Yeah, ともこ, yeah."</p>

<p>She did this to verify I was the right Rob.  On her phone she
  showed me an email I had written to Tomoko saying "I look forward
  to going to TDL with you!"</p>

<p>"Oh, are you going??"</p>

<p>"Yes yes."</p>

<p>"Awesome!"</p>

<p>Turns out she was in my next lesson with みほ and a different ともこ。
  Funny.</p>

<p>Got to Starbucks around 7:30am and have had just the snottiest nose
  ever.  All clear snot, so it's not contageous; it's just allergies.
  janette (I think!) called my cellie a moment ago and I tried to zip
  outside to talk to her (bad reception upstairs here in SB) and she
  was all, "if you can hear me, call me back if you can," and hung up
  just as I was outside.  D'oh!  So I emailed her back and wonder if
  she'll call me again.</p>

<p>As I came back inside, I bought another ホトココア and the cashier
  was all, "are you. English. teacher?"</p>

<p>I'm like, "はい、" and then "毎しゅうここに"</p>

<p>And she goes, "I know," thinking she knew that I was saying I come
  here every week.</p>

<p>But I continued, "。。。日本語を勉強します。"</p>

<p>And she's like, "oh.　私もここに英語を勉強します。"</p>

<p>"ほんと？"</p>

<p>"でも、ぜんぜん英語をはなします。"  (*)</p>

<p>(*) I think this is the conjugation she used.</p>

<p>And I was like, <em>oops; I don't know what to say,</em> so I just
  made an "eeeeek" face like, "yikes stripes."</p>

<p>Wow, janette was right; I can become a regular somewhere and make
  friends that way.  It's only taken 6 months.  ;-)</p>
