<p>Japanese class was fun tonight.  Much easier since I borrowed the
romanji book instead of suffering through the hiragana book.  However,
I had been practicing reading hiragana to make that part easier.
That's why I had to borrow a book; I left my hiragana version at home.
If I go to class next week and bring my hiragana book, I'll sit next
to the instructor so she can help me quickly figure out where in the
book we are studying at any given moment.  That will help.</p>

<p>Found out that the birthday of one of my classmates is 29
February.  So cool!!  We were asking people their birthdates in
Japanese so we learned that about him.  Awesome!</p>

<p>I told him about my days old counter on my site.</p>

<p>I have just created two flyers advertising the contents of my
apartment, including color pics of my futon and chest of drawers.
This is a bit unnerving to me - is my price set well?  Is it worth the
cost of making color copies?  How many copies do I need?  Where are
the best places to put them?</p>

<p>Eeeek!</p>

<p>I mean, thank you Kinko's and universe for making this process
simple for me.</p>

<p>I've just taken the Whole Foods free lunch tour, making two passes
around the store, sampling their goodies.  It's not a full lunch, but
four passes would certainly do the trick.</p>

<p>While walking in, I thought I saw Hallie from my church, but it
wasn't her.  But then it <em>was</em> her inside the store.  So it
seems I was either lucky, or becoming more sensitive to who's around
me, or something good like that.</p>

<p>I've just greeted Kathy Fey for an update and gave her my card.
She works on certain days as a massage-artist at Whole Foods. She's
excited for me (so is everyone) and I feel blessed, yet still
scared.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Before Whole Foods, I was slowing down to turn in at Bookstop, and
because of this I saw Danielle (again, randomly) on the street.  I
gave her my card and an update.</p>

<p>She is posting one of my flyers somewhere for me.</p>

<p>Now I'm going to go visit Dr Pickering (eye doctor) and get my
glasses adjusted and give them an update (and my card).</p>

<p class=date>4:28pm</p>

<p>I turned in (without review) three CDs back to KTRU that I've had
out for probably a year or so.  I feel sad about leaving KTRU.  All
part of the process.</p>

<p>I feel really scared and tired and anxious and everything.  I found
myself in ASL really wanting to just sleep.  Now I have just spent 30
minutes working on an email to Steve about my religious beliefs.  I
feel this is a worthwhile project for me overall, but I'm hard pressed
to think of a reason to really do it right <em>now</em> except that it
distracts me from my other emotions, and lets me play on the computer
where I'm comfortable.</p>

<p>I'm going to go to sleep now and not call any of my friends to
distract me futher.  Just me and my emotions as uncomfortable as they
may be.</p>

<p>Thank you, emotions, for the blessings you bring me.</p>

Bron!!

I'm super glad to hear that you guys loved the soap dish, and I
laughed aloud when I read it's being used as a phone card holder!
That's completely hilarious to me!

The 17th through 31st of August are currently unstructured days for
me.  I have a bit of resistance to driving that far, or paying for a
ticket, but depending on how the next week or so goes for selling my
stuff and moving out, I may do it.

Let me know how your itenerary develops and we can figure out a plan.

My cat's name is Spot.  He's got some pics on my website.
https://www.robnugen.com and click images, then cats, then look for
Spot In Box near the bottom of the page I think.  (I'm composing this
entry while I'm offline, so I can't look it up exactly right now)

I'm having an apartment sale (instead of a garage sale) to sell all my
stuff.  I am getting some boxes from the local grocery to start
packing stuff to store at friends and family homes.  Today is our
independence day celebration so I'm going to visit with my friends
from college.

    With Love
    - Rob!

Dear paypal,

It has recently come to my attention that I cannot use
American Express as my official verifyable bank account
for use with Paypal.  When I called your customer 
service, I could not get a more detailed answer than
"they don't meet the criteria for our authorization
process."

I believe your authorization process is to send them
a couple of ACH transactions, and then have me tell
you what was each amount.

American Express is able to accept ACH transactions.
They are an electronic bank.

Will you let me know why you guys don't like American
Express?  I like them.  They're nice guys and gals,
just like you.

      Thanks
      - Rob
</pre>

<p>So that sums up the problem I'm having with Paypal.  Still feel
free to send large sums of money through the donate button; I'll
figure out a way to accept it.</p>

<p>Today I've been preparing my stuff for my trip or archival or sale
or release.</p>

<p>I've found that it will help if I have some boxes to put stuff in,
but I've been pretty productive even without.  I finished my second
painting, got the marble track to an okay stopping point, put a flag
on it near the top.  Compiled a box of letter writing utensils.</p>

<p>To Maggie's: a big pasta bowl, my marble track, boxes of letters,
high school and college file folders, coin collection, painting that I
finished today.</p>

<p>To Wende: painting that I finished in December</p>

<p>To Dad's: diaries and yearbooks</p>

<p>To Marcel: MR LABS license plate</p>

<p>To Dude: Linux computer, Win NT computer, monitor (if he wants)</p>

<p>Dave is going to purchase my bed and the blue recliner, and he'll
likely rent my apartment.</p>

<p>Folding desk, futon, Elfa shelves, Skandia shelves, three drawer
vertical file cabinet are all for sale; I'll post a note in the
laundry room.  I think I'll have an open apartment garage sale on July
13th.  Books are for sale $1.00/lb.</p>

<p>Traffic was poopy on the way home.  I-45 south was closed under the
beltway on the north side.  Then 59 south was down to one lane where
it went under the bridges.  The lanes of traffic are being shifted to
the newly poured lanes on the right.  Those are the ones that I've
ridden my bike on several times.</p>

<p>I did see some motorcyclists riding 70-80+ mph and popping wheelies
while riding on the highway.  This was going down 45 south before we
got slowed by the beltway closure.  I never got close enough for a
pic.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Wende called me when she was done with work; I'm going to collect
some of my stuff from her storage unit and help her get some stuff to
her storage unit.  Traffic on 59 north was wacked out because a guy's
truck caught on fire.  Big hook and ladder firetruck was there to put
it out.  Wow.</p>
