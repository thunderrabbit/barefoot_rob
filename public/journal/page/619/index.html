                        <p class=date>midnight Friday 26 May 2000</p>

<p>Just arrived.  Almost drove the entire way here;
Scott made it 425 miles on one tank of gas!!!  I don't
know if it was because it was mostly highway driving,
or that I just changed the spark plugs, (or
combination of both) or what.

<p>We were essentially out of gas once we made it to
I-30.  I navigated past the knots of freeway
interchanges, then exited for gas once I was sure we'd
have an easy time getting back on the freeway.

<p>Security guard was talking to a guy when I walked
barefootedly past them and gave the cashier my credit
card.  Got gas and the security guard was alone when I
walked barefootedly back in to sign the receipt and
stuff.

<p>"Can't go in without shoes."

<p>"They have my credit card; I can't pay unless I go
in and sign it."

<p>I had just driven 4.5 hours straight, had already
walked in barefoot while he was talking.  I wasn't in
much of a mood to fuck with him; I'm glad he
relatively easily 'allowed' me in.

<p>The cashier was glad too; my card wasn't being
accepted by the machine.

<p>"Hey hey c'mere c'mere" he beckoned.  "Your card it
ain't going through.  You got any other way you can
pay for this?"

<p>"I got cash."

<p>"Cool"

<p>He was a tall Jamaican guy, and was pretty funny
when he gave me my receipt.  He was all, "be sure to
keep the receipt cause if your bank is trippin' you
can show them this and say, 'hey fool I paid!'"

<p>"Thanks!"

<p>The rest of the 30-few miles to the church was much
less eventful.

<p>- - - -

<p class=date>5pm Saturday 27 May 2000</p>

<p>After meeting for 5 hours we went outside for a
frisbee break.  Tossed around an ultimate disc and a
golf disc.  Taught Mark how to throw a disc a bit
better and I tossed a couple of long as I could throws
to Sean and Austin down the field.

<p>It started raining, so Mark went inside.  We kept
playing in the pouring rain, and Laura and Elizabeth
went down to the swings to swing in the rain.   More
golf disc tossing and then the girls went to lay on
the concrete, which they discovered was super warm!!

<p>Perfect giggles and fun we all lay on the concrete
for the most memorable blissful spiritual perfect fun
moment lying on concrete warm and cold rain.  Steam
wafted around us lik mystery fog.  Austin discoverd
that by shielding the light around his eyes, he could
imagine he was snorkling in muddy water.  Muddy water
over concrete?

<p>Russ and Mark came out to see how/what we were
doing.  They weren't persuaded to join us.  They left
us giggling on the concrete, marveling in the
dichotomy between the warm surface and cold rain.

<p>Finally got up and began trudging back toward the
church.  Halfway back, we met Mark and Russ, who had a
camera!!  We ran back and laughed at the dichotomy of
having trudged back toward work, but then running back
to lay in the water.

<p>- - - -

<P class=date>6:40pm</p> Austin and Sean came back
with cooked spaghetti.  "Yeah, it's in the kitchen" 
Laura and Elizabeth ran to the kitchen, but soon came
back empty handed.  

<p>"Hahaha!!  We cooked it in the tea kettle!"

<p>- - - -

<p><em>The Matrix</em> was started on VCR and I
watched a bit until I had to go pick up Katie from
work.  Mark asked if I wanted company; we had a great
conversation about UUism and district stuff and then
shifted toward our personal beliefs about God and
stuff.  

<p>We basically have the same or similar beliefs about
stuff:  God could not have an ego; Jesus was a
spiritual guy who greatly communicated his
spirituality.

<p>We agree that he was probably a guy, and did all
kinds of cool stuff, but the "I am the one and only"
is where we have to draw the line.  

<p>- - - -

<p>Got Katie and during conversation on the way back,
mentioned Balmorrhea (sp) state park, and she was all,
"That's it!!!"  She and her dad have been trying to
remember the name of the cool park they visited some
years ago.

<p>How wonderful to have the Synchronicity bring her
that answer.

<p>- - - -

<p>Matrix was almost over when we got back.  At the
end of the movie, I complained about the timing when
the Sentinels were attacking the ship and then just
*quit* for 3 minutes while Trinity proclaimed her love
for Neo.  Such bullcrap!  I announced my much better
ending:

<p><em>Neo is being chased through the building as the
Sentinels are attacking the ship.  Trinity is all,
"you can't use the EMP until he is back."  Morpheus
goes, "he'll make it; he is the one."

<p>Neo bursts through door 301 (or whatever it was)
and get shot just as the Sentinels are shredding
through the ship.</em>

<p>(What I have described above is pretty much how the
movie goes; below is different)

<p><em>The ship is being shredded, Neo's EKG lines go
flat as he is shot and killed by the Agents.  Morpheus
has no choice; pushes the EMP button and kills the
Sentinels.  Neo is apparently lost.

<p>Trinity kneels beside Neo's body in the real world,
proclaims her feelings for him; how she's not afraid.

<p>Meanwhile, the Agents check Neo's pulse.  "He's
gone."  They leave his body in a heap.

<p>Trinity kisses Neo in the real world.  His body
wakes up in The Matrix.  Neo has the big fight with
the bad guys, stops the bullets, blows up the Bad Guy.
 He closes his eyes, vanishes from The Matrix, wakes
up in the real world.

<p>Trinity witnesses his revival and they embrace and
all is good.</em>

<p>See, if Neo could control the Matrix, he doesn't
need a *phone* to move in and out of the Matrix.  He
just does it.

<p class=date>10:17pm Saturday 27 May 2000<p>

<p>Meeting is resumed; I just typed the first section
of this entry about driving up here and getting gas.

<p class=date>5:45 am Sunday 28 May 2000</p>

<p>I went to bed after watching the first part of
<em>Grosse Pointe Blank</em> (I think the opening
sequence is the best part of the movie)..

<p>Woke up at 5:40am, heard laughter from the YRUU
room.  I thought "cool - they're still awake," and got
up to see if maybe the group wanted to play a game of
Silent Football.  Surprised to see Mark was still
awake!!  (Turns out he had just gotten up at his
normal time.  (Eeek!))

<p>Silent Football was fun; Mark had never previously
played and he did very well.  (Laura had read the
rules on the ~sauron website; she did quite well too.)
 

<p>(While I was typing this entry we were discussing
how SF started as a drinking game.  Austin goes, yeah
almost all games started out as drinking games.  I
lied, "yeah - like basketball.. Used to be a drinking
game - when they finished a basket full of bottles of
beer, they put the basket on the wall and would try to
throw the beer bottles into it.  It used to be called
"basketbottle" but there was too much broken glass
everywhere, so they just used balls."   No one called
me a big fat liar hahaha.)

<p>Back in reality, I enjoyed Mark's synopsis of the
Shrotem / Shrug rule.  (So there's not two defensives
moves, but two ways to express the same move.) 
Precisely.  I may use that.  Oh - I also made up a fun
way of describing part of the rules...  

<p>"There are two aspects of the game.  One is the
movement of the sacred football, the other is
discussion of the movement of the sacred football. 
There are two ways to gain penance points.  One is to
make an error during movement of the sacred football. 
The other is to make an error during the discussion of
the movement of the sacred football."

<p>Also honored Wende with a new Customary: "Customary
disinfecting wipe!" (motion of wiping one's mouth with
sleeve)

<p>Mr Austin and Mr The Bibbster were most wacked in
their games (Mr Austin moreso)  Very fun.  Ms Laura
and Mr Mark did well too.  I already said that.  I'm
tired..  good night again.

<p class=date>4:30pm Sunday 28 May 2000</p>

<p><p>Woke up around 10am and played a game of mental
clue with Elizabeth and Austin.  Amazingly enough, I
guessed Elizabeth&rsquo;s choices on the first try.  That&rsquo;s
the second time I&rsquo;ve done that&hellip; The other was at one
of the Northwood&rsquo;s retreats&hellip;  New Year&rsquo;s 1999 I
think.</p>

<p><p>Cleaned up and left for home around 11am.</p>

<p><p>On the way home, I discovered that I had left my
clear plastic red clipboard there.  DOH!!!  I
thankfully expect I will be able to get it at least by
OKC rally next weekend.</p>

<p><p><img src="/images/rob/wL-ROB.gif"></p>

<p><p>PS:  I have just discovered that I can get a
palmtop computer thing with a full sized keyboard.
I&rsquo;m gonna get one so I can write journal entries on
the road super duper easily.  Yay!!</p>

<p class=date>6:51am CDT Friday 26 May 2000</p></p>

<p><p>I dreamt that I had corrupted a database at work, and spent the
entire evening trying to fix it.  Weird thing is that SAS never
entered the dream - only database and the sense that I was having
nerdy fun rebuilding it.</p>

<p><p>Lynda arrived and was hanging from a showerhead to help stretch out
her back while Wende tackled the database problem for me.  Finally
Wende was able to solve it.</p>

<p><p>On my way to work that morning, I was driving my dad&rsquo;s old pickup
truck, (which I drove before I got Scott). The movie Aladdin had just
made it to Blockbuster, and they were selling gold plated turntables.
I stopped in and checked to see if the turntables were Technics direct
drive.  They were not.</p>

<p><p>No one was on the sales floor, so I walked toward the back looking
for someone to ask if they had the kinda turntable I want.  I could
hear someone typing, but they didn&rsquo;t respond to my &ldquo;Hello?&ldquo;s</p>

<p><p>In one corner, they had a wooden train set arranged so all the
trains could go careening down a miniature hill.</p>

<p><p>The mystery typist never responded, so I got back in my truck and
woke up.</p>

<p><p>So we started a new project today.  This one is a smaller, but it allows participants to take the survey in UK English, Japanese, German or French.  I have created the program that writes the screen to choose a language.  We already had the French and German translation.  The English version is American English; I just left it.  For the Japanese version, I wrote a quick haiku.</p>

It&rsquo;s for the annual YAC retreat&hellip;  I&rsquo;ve always had someone ride with me the past 3 years, but not this year.  I&rsquo;ll take a snooze before leaving tonight.</p>

<p class=date>5:17am CDT Thursday 25 May 2000</p></p>

<p><p>I dreamt I had a ticket to The Cure concert (which was last night (how was it Sarah?)) and I wanted to go with Maggie and John.  We all rode together and got to the place and it was a long drive.  When we were in line, I realized I didn&rsquo;t have my ticket.</p>

<p><p>I yelled grouchy words and threatened to cry, so the ticket taker let me in.</p>

<p><p>Once inside, I got separated from Maggie and John.  The concert
hall was like a large 400 person lecture hall (AH Aud 1, for UH
students) with the stage kinda over toward stage right.  A grand piano
and some microphones were up there.</p>

<p>&lt;<p>The place was pretty packed with audience members and the band was
setting up and stuff.  They were all old, reminding me of MAD Magazine
writers.</p>

<p>&lt;p.The performance started with a description of how it&rsquo;s cool to have a popular song because they get paid not only for royalties, but paid each time someone does a  cover of the song.  (I have no idea if this is actually true)</p>

<p><p>I saw Maggie down a few rows below me, sitting without John, and I invited her up to sit with me, where I had an empty seat beside me.  I had been curled up sleeping across both seats before I saw her.  She came up and told me that John had gone off to sit somewhere else without her.</p>

<p><p>At this point in the dream, I was naked, but no one seemed to care
(not even me, really; I surmised I must have been naked on the way in
and just didn&rsquo;t notice it, since no one else noticed, so it must be
okay.)</p>

<p><p>The guy then started asking questions of the audience.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Who invented chocolate?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Willy Wonka!&rdquo;  I blurted.</p>

<p><p>He said &ldquo;no, Willy Wonka popularized chocolate, but a man named Tom
__something) invented it.&rdquo;  (Actually, wasn&rsquo;t it discovered by Spain
and then sent around the world from there?)</p>

<p><p>Then he asked, &ldquo;if chocolate factory machinery is working well, will the chocolate be good?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I answered &ldquo;not necessarily, because it takes people to monitor the
machines, to get that final touch of goodness.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>He said I was correct.</p>

<p><p>Then Wende and I left the concert (not that she had been there
previously) and I was carrying Spot down the hall.  He was all being
fiesty and trying to bite me, even when I held him by the scruff of the
neck.</p>

<p><p>Then I woke up when Wende asked if I could go feed the cats who had
entered my dream by squawking out in the hall.</p>

<p><p>YES!!!</p>

<p><p>I got the DSL working!!!  I&rsquo;m on Wende&rsquo;s computer, with an old 3Com NIC from work, connected on our paid-for-by-work DSL line!!  It&rsquo;s 150k SDSL with guaranteed bandwidth.  So awesome!</p>

<p><p>Now we can talk on the phone and surf all at once!!</p>

<p><p>Yippeee!!!</p>

<p class=date>8:09am CDT Wednesday 24 May 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Today I changed Scott&rsquo;s spark plugs.  The task takes only 30
minutes, including cleanup, but somehow I seem to put it off forever.
Fortunately, the plugs were not all corroded or covered in that stuff,
um.. sediment like.  In fact, they were quite fine, although one had
oil on it, indicating a leak.</p>

<p><p>Wende and I have decided to fix Scott&rsquo;s leaks!  I&rsquo;ve had oil
dripping from various locations around the engine, but just haven&rsquo;t
spent the $$$ to get them all fixed.  Fixing oil leaks should come
before putting up new blinds in the house, we believe.  (or at least
at the same time)</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m DSL connected!!  Actually, the router is DSL connected.  I can
ping it, but I haven&rsquo;t got the drivers for the NIC in my linux box.
I&rsquo;ll work on that now.</p>

<p><p>Yipes!!!</p>

<p><p>We had SO MUCH silly fun on Sunday..  I really hope to get it typed up, but I don&rsquo;t have time right now.  work work work.</p>

<p><p>Saturday night at KTRU was fun with my 4 DJs in training, but I got two emails today from the station manager - I forgot to log 2 items on the official FCC log.  Doh!!</p>

<p><p>Today even before work I got Scott&rsquo;s muffler replaced, deposited checks for investment club, and something else&hellip; I forget.</p>

<p><p>And we have DSL at home!!  I&rsquo;ve not got my linux box NIC set up yet (nor Wende&rsquo;s machine, nor my other windows machine..) but anyway the DSL works and I hope to have our machines connected soon!!</p>

<p class=note>(this entry started on 22 june 2000)</p>

<p><p>kT and I arrived in plenty of time, making up joke reasons to explain
why we were parking in the Christian Scientists parking lot, and
sneaking out the back toward the Unitarian Universalist parking lot..</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes, we are actually Christian Scientists, spying on the UUs.&rdquo;  We hid
behind trees, cars, trash cans, and thin light poles like cartoon
characters, making our way to the back of Anna&rsquo;s parking lot.  kT peeked
around some shrubs.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Eeeek!  that&rsquo;s them!&rdquo;  and she ducked back down as we stiffled
giggles.  Anna&rsquo;s family had been driving in (facing right at us) exactly
when kT peeked.</p>

<p><p><em>How to do this?</em> we wondered..  They had gone inside, but we had
no idea where Anna would be.  Upstairs, downstair, front door, side
door..  Hmmm.</p>

<p><p>So in the parking lot, I asked some guy I had never previously met.
&ldquo;Do you know Anna?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Yes he did, and he casually scoped out the church then came back.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s right in the front entrance.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Just so happened that this guy had keys to the side door.  kT and I
snuck around the parking lot, joking all they way, to the side door
where our secret liaison unlocked it and let us in.</p>

<p><p>Up behind the sanctuary is a small room with a small door on each
side.  The doors lead to air conditioning units and big insulated tubing
to blow the air into the sanctuary.  kT and I weasled our way around the
big tubes to the air vent that overlooked the sanctuary.  From there we
had a perfect overview of the whole room!</p>

<p><p><em>&ldquo;there&rsquo;s Anna!&rdquo;</em> I whispered.  kT peered down at Anna,
sitting with her parents.  The air conditioner was on, so we pretty much
could not hear everything that was going on below.  We also assumed that
no one could hear us whispering.</p>

<p><p>We mimed jokes to each other:
<br>* What if we leaned on the vent and fell out into the sanctuary?
<br>(We would just do it very quietly of course!)
<br>* (deep voice) &ldquo;Anna, this is God&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>The funniest thing (to kT) is when my legs fell entirely asleep after
I had been squatting for about 20 minutes.  I writhed in silent tickling
tingly agony as she mimed uproarious laughter!</p>

<p><p>The air conditioner went off for a moment, and the silence made me
feel quite quite conspicuous.  Unfortunately, by the time Anna took the
stage, the air conditioner was on again, and we could hardly hear what
she was saying.  <em>&ldquo;Anna speak loudly!&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><p>When she finished, we quickly snuck our way back out of the little
room and downstairs to the kitchen behind the sanctuary.  Other youth
were in there and they were all, &ldquo;Woah!!&rdquo; and me and kT were all,
&ldquo;shhshsh we&rsquo;re sneaking up on Anna&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Into the sanctuary, we silently bruskly gently whispered &ldquo;&lsquo;scuse me&rdquo;
past people along the wall to Anna&rsquo;s chair, which happened to be on one
edge of the sanctuary.  I just appeared beside her and smiled.</p>

<p><p>Her expression I will never forget.  A happy state of astonished
shock lifted her from the seat into a big tearfilled hug.  Hugs to kT
too and then we sat on the floor with our backs against the wall for the
rest of the service.</p>

<p><p>Most lovely, Amy played her harp, &ldquo;Wind beneath my wings&rdquo; I believe.</p>

                        <p><title>KTRU</title>
<p class=date>11:33pm CDT Saturday 20 May 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Wow!  My new KTRU shift is 7 to 10 pm Saturdays during the summer.
Ironically, I will not be available for my next two shifts; I&rsquo;ll be at
YAC retreat and OKC rally respectively.</p>

<p><p>Today I had four (4), count-em 4 DJs-in-training during my shift!
I feel pretty honored to <em>train</em> DJs, when it seems like just a
year ago that Alexis trained me.  (It was a year ago)   Awwwww.</p>

<p><p>The shift was great fun, and seemed to go really quickly with all
the people in there helping and asking questions and such.  Three of
them went on mic (it was their second training) and all four of them
cued up and played music.  All of them made good beginner DJ errors
that I made back in the day.  Very comforting.  I even showed them
cueing errors on vinyl so they could know what not to do, and how to
recover from it.</p>

<p><p>I finally got to meet Jesse.  He&rsquo;s the DJ after me, and I&rsquo;ve heard
his voice a lot, but never had met him.  He&rsquo;s cool.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>Today Wende and her best friend from high school Irene and Irene&rsquo;s
fiance&rsquo; Nick (from Down Under) and Irene&rsquo;s brother Tom all went to
Astroworld.  I greatly enjoyed hearing the stories from their point of
view.  I haven&rsquo;t been this year (I don&rsquo;t have a Season Pass) because
they didn&rsquo;t put in a new roller coaster.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>Today (while they were at Astroworld), I was at investment club
meeting.  It was good and productive once we finally got down to
business.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>Oh, before investment club meeting was the final competition in the
spring ultimate tournament!  Our team had 2 morning games, a Bye (rest
while others play) then 2 afternoon games.  I said &lsquo;bye-bye for real&rsquo;
at the Bye to attend my meeting.  We had lost both games before that;
I wonder how they did in the afternoon&hellip;.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>This morning I had a dream that OKC rally was really bad because we
didn&rsquo;t play Silent Football!!  We will have to play!</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m tired and going to bed!</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>OH!  Last thing..  Today while I was at KTRU, someone called and
asked for me.  One of the DJs said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your girlfriend again.&rdquo;  I
answered the phone and it was kT!!  She was calling from Anna&rsquo;s house
to report the results of her secret spy mission: Anna will be speaking
at church at 11:00am tomorrow.  We&rsquo;re going to surprise her there!</p>

<p><p>If you read this before tomorrow morning, don&rsquo;t tell Anna!</p>

<p><p>Yesterday morning and this morning our house alarm went off.  It&rsquo;s loud!!  For some reason Zone 5 got triggered&hellip; Zone 5 is our upstairs bedroom windows.  They were all closed.  I don&rsquo;t know what the deal is.  Called the alarm guy and he&rsquo;ll come out on Monday.</p>

<p><p>Speakin&rsquo; of Monday, we will likely get our DSL line on Monday!!  We need to get NICs (Network Interface Cards) for the computers that we want to have DSL-connected.  Yay!!</p>

<p><p>We are almost done with the big project that I&rsquo;ve been working on for probably over a month.  &ldquo;almost done&rdquo; means almost done with initial coding for this year.  Next year we will enhance it more probably.  Just added to the project is (essentially) &ldquo;allow administrators to add new participants to the database, but not add them to the administrator&rsquo;s list&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ll retro-fit a big piece of code to allow that.</p>
