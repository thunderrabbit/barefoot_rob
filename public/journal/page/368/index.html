<p>Oh my god.  As I was blabbering on so eloquently about why I love
to blabber fully blabberfully on my site, I forgot about meeting Ayana
for tutoring today.  She graciously let me cancel this meeting for no
charge, and graciously said that I'd have to pay next time I cancel
with no warning.  I'm supposed to be in Shibuya in 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Ponder ponder ponder...  An idea is to go there now and carefully
measure how long it takes me to get there.  Cointoss
says....... no.</p>

<p>I absolutely will get a whiteboard to use as a calendar; that's the
technique that's organically developed ...  shit that is *ridiculous*
that I carry this computer around and don't use it as a calendar!  And
it's a Mac for god's sakes that should be easy to do!!!!</p>

<p>The hardest part is training myself to write in here.</p>

<p>Ironies abound that I'm compelled to write all the events that
occur, but not write all that I have planned.  'swat it boils down
to.  Okay fine.  Move on.</p>

<p>I'm going to the 100 yen store to get a whiteboard.</p>

<p>The bullet trains are *so* fast.  Shit they're just amazingly fast
and when I ride to work along the river, I go underneath a bullet
train track.</p>

<p>Tonight, as I approached the tracks...  it's just like
whhhoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooommmmm and then it's
gone.  Always 16 white cars with a pointy snout and pointy tail.
Maybe I'll take an mpeg of it with my camera sometime.  It's just sooo
fucking <em>fast!</em></p>

<p>The vantage point I have from the river doesn't put me right beside
the tracks, but about five feet below the actual track level..  BUT
there's a wall that nearly blocks the whole thing from my view when
I'm close to the tracks.  I look forward to having a clear close view
of those trains screaming by like aircraft.</p>

<p>That's how fast it seems.  It might as well fly.</p>

<br>Hi Rob,<br>
<br>
I was working on a letter to Judy Bayley and starting thinking about you.I went to your website (for the first time) and read the last 3 days--you've gone through a lot!  I hope in the future you have a month of happiness for each day of frustration.<br>
<br>
Everyone is different, of course, but your journal helps me guess what my wife must have gone through her first couple of months in the U.S.<br>
<br>
Hope you have many breakthroughs in learning Japanese!<br>

<p class=dream>I had come back to the US and was at Maggie's house.
She lived in a set of condominiums and the pizza guy who was her
friend came to deliver a pizza to some people at the pool, but the
pool was closed and he had no way to know who had been there, nor
where they were now.  So he asked if Maggie would take the pizza,
which she did, but she wrote a note with her umbrella in the cheese,
like she drew a pictogram of the people at the pizza place telling him
"Go take this pizza to the pool" and then him at the pool encountering
a "POOL CLOSED" sign.  Pretty effective for a cheese drawing.</p>

<p class=dream>Maggie and I were chillin' on the bed and were
beginning to be affectionate and then were like "whoops! can't do
that!" and I went home.</p>

<p class=dream>I came home to a big house and needed to throw away
parts of a sandwich.  I went outside to throw it out and I saw a half
dazed crow outside the back porch kinda leaning against the wall like
it was sick.  It turned out to be a half cat half crow.  Like cat body
and face but little wing nubs and a beak.  Very weird.</p>

<p class=dream>The back yard sloped downward steeply away from the
house, so when I looked out into the forest, it was into the forest of
branches with tree trunks below my line of vision, not into a forest
of tree trunks with branches above.  At my eye level, discarded and
caught by the trees and beginning to rust and merge with the
environment was an entire passenger train.  I could only imagine the
previous owners of this house we were in would be surprised to see
this new addition to the back yard.</p>

<p class=dream>I was living with Rie (or was it Koko) and I asked her
if she had a camera so I could take a picture of the crow-cat.  She
did and I gave her a one armed hug from behind.</p>

<p>Sometimes I run scenarios through my head, imagined conflicts that
I think might happen and get my brain fully "prepared" to engage -
practicing what I'll say if s/he says this, or if he says that...  how
I can defend myself and prove that I've done the right thing.</p>

<p>I just recently got a phone call from work saying that Tsurumi
school thinks I'm scheduled to work <em>there</em> today in the early
shift.  The woman who called is from Kawasaki (I think) and couldn't
find a shift swap form.  I know one reason she can't find it is that
it doesn't exist.  Or that I never saw it.</p>

<p>Suddenly I was going through scenarios of them falsifying the
document to fake like I had signed it and I prepared myself to
basically quit my job.  And then I'm arguing with a mental version of
Steve about riding my bike to work.</p>

<p>On a non-bizarre note, I've just done laundry.  Actually, some
might think that <em>is</em> bizarre for me.</p>

<p>Okay I'm going to hang up this laundry, and roll to work.</p>

<p>Work was aight today.  Had some man to mans (usually good) and some
level 7Cs (lowest level (often bad)) and one level 3 class (pretty
great English skills (almost always good unless they are better at
grammar than I)) and one level 4 class (good skillz (good))</p>

<p>Whatever.</p>

<p>I rode my bike to work for the first time in a real life situation
and I felt pretty confident I was going the right way at each
intersection; it basically takes two turns to get there, but many
vaguely similar intersections and landmarks, so it's still a bit
tricky.  What I mostly end up doing is watching for big road signs
that point me toward different cities.  I intentionally rode mostly
slowly so I wouldn't be coated in sweat when I arrived.  I was a tad
sweaty in the pits and on my back (from my back pack), but otherwise
no worries.  Oh and my footses were quite hot.  I might wear
sandals??????? to ride and then put on shoes at work so I won't
impregnate these leather shoes with sweat.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Rode home and similarly didn't get lost.  But the coooooolest
thing was the bullet train.</p>

<p>Frank is a genius.</p>

<p>He actually <em>looked at a map</em> other than the
not-exactly-to-scale train map and noted that Kawasaki is not too far
away.  Tonight, the night I got my bike back, I rode my bike to
Kawasaki with only a river as my guide and made it to my work in 1
hour.  Once there, I stopped by the cop box to see if I could park my
bike in the area.  I could.  They gave me vague directions to get back
to Tsunashima and said it would take me an hour to ride there.</p>

<p>I got back in 45 minutes.</p>

<p>That's how long it takes to walk and ride the train to work.  If I
ride my bike, I can keep the reimbursement I get for my train pass
each month.  That's 15,000 yen, equivalent to five shifts of
overtime.</p>

<p>Plus, if I ride my bike to work, I'll be staying in shape.</p>

<p>I'm tie-erd.  Good night.  Actually I gotta shower first cause I
stink like ew.</p>

<p>Often, my students in Nova don't know the word "instead," and I
have not yet worked out a quick way to explain it.  But here are some
examples of its use:</p>

<p>Instead of having my wallet, the police did not have my wallet.</p>

<p>Instead of being open, the bank was closed.</p>

<p>Instead of buying a chain wallet, I did not buy a chain wallet
because instead of having any money, I have no money.</p>

<p>My money locked away in the bank instead of in my hand.</p>

<p>Instead of restraining my emotions as I understand the Japanese do
to prove their integrity of character, I yelled "fuck fuckin' fuck
fuck!" at almost the top of my lungs while outside beside loud traffic
and wind that drowned out my voice.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Now I'm at the International Lounge waiting for Koko.  I really
hoped to do some of this myself.  I shoulda asked Matty or Frank for
some cash, but I turned it down, assuming the bank would be open
today.</p>

<br>to explanin instead&hellip;.<br>
its ins generally easier to say what you did do first instead of what you didnt.<br>
<br>
it makes more sense in the middle of a sentence instead of at the beginning.<br>
<br>
i dont understand EXACTLY how you teach them but &hellip;. give them an orange or something and say  &ldquo;here, w ould  you like an orange?  or instead, would you like this moldy bananna?&rdquo;  or whatever else you have on hand&hellip;.  you should do it that way first bec. its easier to understand compare/contrast issues that way..<br>
<br>
and i dont recomend yelling fuck at them :)<br>
<br>
and i HAD an easter card for you&hellip;but forgot to send it&hellip; so i bought a new one..and perhaps it might get sent this time :)<br>
<br>
later gater<br>
<br>
15 min till final in history&hellip;.when i read your entries, it makes me laugh instead of worrying about my finals!<br>

<p>Oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh how can I thank Koko enough?</p>

<p>We're at the bank, and she's leading me through the process of
getting cash out (can't use the bank book at all??) and cancelling my
old card and getting a new card...  But they need my gaijin card
(alien ID) card so now we're at the ward office where I got my first
gaijin card.</p>

<p>But get <em>this</em>: they will not use another print of the same
photo I used for the first card.  A month ago I got my picture made in
a photo booth.  Four passport sized photos came out.  I gave them
these photos.  They used two and they gave me back two.</p>

<p>So today I brought the remaining two and the cat remembered me and
said they cannot use them.  I must get new photos.  The rule is
<em>inflexible</em>, as translated by Koko.</p>

<p>That's fuckin' freaky.  Koko agrees that it's strange and can't
explain it.</p>

<p>So we visited the photo booth and my new photos are of me unshaved,
with longer hair.  Longer enough that the difference is noticable, but
not like a shaggy dog.</p>

<p>I wanted to get photos-stickers of Koko and I to commemerate this
wild day (her phone has mysteriously quit; she called her mom and it
worked fine, but the next time she opened it... nothing) but that
particular booth doesn't make sticker pictures, just plain ol'
pics.</p>

<p>One reason I want to get photos is for her shirt.  On the front it
says in big letters: "CUM!" and on the back in two lines across the
bottom: "a feeling everybody can be happy with."</p>

<p>I wonder if we can get the bike today; my sense is that I'll need
her to vouch/prove I may use it, but if she is with me, we can't both
ride it home.  And we can't put it on the bus.  I haven't seen bike
racks on buses here like in Cali.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Speaking of racks, the bike rack that I used for my bike that
fateful day was not exactly a bike rack.</p>

<p>It was a frame to hold the sign: "BICYCLE PARKING FORBIDDEN"</p>

<p><em>Next</em> to the rack, er sign, is okay.</p>

<p class=date>2:34pm</p>

<p>Last night, Matty said "bad things happen in threes; you're in for
something else, mate."</p>

<p>Today with Koko, after I withdrew 80,000 yen from my bank, leaving
a lovely 40,000 yen worth of zeros (too bad it wasn't a 1 with
40,000 zeros!), I bought the photos, some stamps, and then a chain
wallet.  At the 100 yen store, I discovered I had only 71,000 yen
left.  Somehow I had lost 8,000 yen ($70 or so).</p>

<p>Release, release, release.</p>

<p>Koko seemed more upset than I.  I woulda been more upset if
it was the first thing I had lost recently, but now I'm just like,
8000 yen.  meh.</p>

<p>We're now at the Do Co Mo phone shop trying to revive her
phone.</p>

<p class=date>4:24pm</p>

<p>Phone is revived, but not necessarily stable.  They said buy a new
one (of course) and I suggested see how long it lasts.</p>

<p>Lunch = done.  First-Kitchen is a slightly better than fast food
kinda place.  But smoking is allowed inside.  Ew.</p>

<p>But here's the real awesome thing: Koko and I were stuck on how to
get her and me to the bike place and back again with a bike.  Koko's
mom to the rescue: she'll drive us there.</p>

<p>Oh my gosh what can I do for Koko's mom to thank her
enoughly???</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>So is that it?  With a bike will I be back on track, stable, good,
etcetera?  Almost..  I still don't know fo'sheezy where I can legally
park the bike, and I don't have my gaijin card replaced (that will be
ready after 14 May) and I don't have a replacement bank card (until
after the gaijin card comes back)</p>

<p>Oh, and I need to call my US bank to have them cancel that
card.</p>

<p>Dammit.  I knew that cat was giving me incorrect directions.  At
the bike place, after getting my bike back, and profuse verbal thanks
given to Koko's mom, Koko asked where Tsunashima was and he pointed
all over the place except where I knew the shit to be.  I went his way
anyway and now I'm 5km from Shin-Yokohama and 1km away from Hiyoshi
and dammit if I can't find Hiyoshi on the map to get an estimate of
where I am.</p>

<p>And double dammit that I don't know where it is; cause I
should.</p>

<p>I'm debating going back the way I came to prove that I coulda
gotten home without his help,or had I ignored his help but fuck that
wouldn't prove it to anyone but me.</p>

<p>I'm worth it.  I'm going back.</p>

<p class=date>7:01pm</p>

<p>We were both right.  I had missed a turnoff.</p>

<p>I walked to the train/bus station that I normally used but took the
bus instead of the train, as suggested on the sheet to get my bike.
Showed the driver the name of the bus stop I wanted to visit and he
was all, "ÅÕÇ¢" (yes) and I'm like, "Å†ÇËÇ™Ç∆" (thanks, chief) and then
we go on our merry way.</p>

<p>Fortunately, before we reached my bus stop, I noticed I had showed
him the name of the <em>destination</em> for this bus. Not my stop.
Double fortunately, by that time I had done enough pattern matching to
know what I was looking / listening for to identify my stop.  Just in
time, I found it.</p>

<p>Got off the bus and was like "?????" cause I had no idea which way
to walk, etc to find my bike.</p>

<p>Showed a cat the map I had and he went inside and produced another
map with my path highlighted on it.  Thank god for the Japanese
helpful society.</p>

<p>Walked to the destination and as I think I should be there by now I
see it.  Hundreds of sad bikes, locked away in the Bike Pound.  The pound was only
identifiable by me by all the bikes and all the barbed wire on top of
a strong fence.</p>

<p>Looked at the gate.  Locked.  *Now* I know what the "yammeryammer
11 yammeryam 7 yammer yammyam" meant on the piece of paper.  11 to 7 is when they are open.</p>

<p>Excellent.  I'll just settle down and practice Japanese for an
hour.  I knew I'd need a comfortable place to sit, so I began to
explore the area a bit, walking up a ramp to the crosswalk over the
street and got a higher perspective of the view of bikes.</p>

<p>Make that <em>thousands</em> of bikes filling this 2 acre pen.
They are all lined up carefully, but otherwise unprotected from the
elements.</p>

<p>And then I noticed something.  Not out there but right here on me.
Not a bug nor a snake, but something disgustingly <em>missing</em>.</p>

<p>My wallet.</p>

<p>How the holy <em>fuck</em> did I not bring my wallet?  Am I an <em>idiot</em>???  Don't I realize that I need *money* to recover my bike?</p>

<p>I cried.  I sighed.  I called Frank at home.  My wallet is not on my desk.</p>

<p>Fortunately I have enough change to take the bus back home.  I
think I'll look for an ATM and crack into my account for the first
time since I've been here.  I've not been paid yet, but they gave me
(and anyone else who requested it (and who wouldn't??))  an interest
free loan that will be taken out of my next three paychecks.   I had
hoped to leave it and its pretty zeros unblemished in my account.
Like a perfect crystal sphere, the wholeness of which *proves* that I
can live in Japan on my own.  No loans, no coddling.  Proof.</p>

<p>Well now I'm about to prove I can change my mind, find an ATM, and
shatter some fuckin' crystal.</p>

<p class=date>9:07am</p>

<p>Shit.   That was a perfect ending to a cool entry.  I'll shatter it:</p>

<p>I have to have my <em>wallet</em> before I can get the bike because my ID *and* my proof that the bike has been loaned to me is in there.  Back
to the bus I go.</p>

<p>(note: I do not have to have my wallet to get money; I can use my passbook to get cash from the ATMs.)</p>
