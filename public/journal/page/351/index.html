                        <p class=date>1:54am JST Thursday 10 July 2003</p>

<p>Today I noticed that it's the people who do things differently that
get noticed.   Those who are willing to go against the grain.
Apparently I want to be noticed, which is why I keep wondering about
this. So I don't want to go against the grain like Eminem and diss
everybody and everything.  I'd like to go against the grain more like
Ghandi, but I don't know anything about him really except he somehow
got a bunch of cats to not fight against those who wanted to fight
them. Or something.</p>

<p>Frank is in the other room writing what I presume is his book.  I
just took a shower and wondered about my technique of being so
scattered, which is something I seem to admire in janette, who can
just flitter about from project to project, somehow keeping all the
lids on all the pots and all the people around her happy, and herself
too, it seems.  And I admire that in her but I wonder if it bugs me in
myself.  It's like I want to focus on one project and make it complete
and really do something, but there's a part of me that doesn't finish
- that can't do that final step of folding the clothes after I've
washed them, dried them, collected them, but then just blam throw them
in the drawer unfolded.   or cleaning my room which is not all that
messy, but just stays perpetually in this state of not quite clean,
even though various parts of it cycle through phases of cleanliness
(except for my desk, unless it's on a really slow cycle which happens
to be in the messy phase).</p>

<p>Ron Anderson believes that credits are the key to happiness.  He's
a miser to the nth degree and tries desperately to hoarde his wealth
cause he thinks they will keep him happy.  Or that one day when he has
enough he will become happy.</p>

<p>Mr Biggs has a ton of wealth.   His accumlated wealth makes
Anderson's look trivial.  Biggs knows that wealth does not equal
happiness.  He gains happiness by tormenting others, by making them
suffer.  He has such a ridiculous amount of money that he cannot be
touched by anyone or anything.  He owns all of this.</p>

<p>The girl, whose name I've forgotten, is one of the heros of the
story.  She knows that though computers and wealth are flashy and fun,
that the true essence of life is in life itself - in experiencing life
consciously, with an amused detachment as she lets her angels guide
her where she needs to be.  She's one that I'd marry, except that I'd
be too afraid to talk to her.</p>

<p>Her brother, whose name might be Alex, is on the same path as their
dad Ron, but he will discover almost too late that money will rip his
soul from his self, and we'll try to rescue him from all the horrors
that are trying to push him down.</p>

<p>Ah.  I suddenly remembered the names of the siblings.   Andra and
Anthony.</p>

<p>Anthony has created an AI droid from scratch because he didn't
trust anyone to create it for him.  He wanted to know absolutely there
were no programming virii or bombs of any variety in her.  He loves
her and has fallen in love with her, and would basically freak if she
were taken away.</p>

<p>This is interesting.  I named her Nova, after the fucking fine girl
in an old TV series(?) miniseries(?) about outer space and the like.
She was absolutely gorgeous and I fell in love with her on that TV
show.  I just looked up her name on my site and... ew.  Nova.</p>

<p>Okay.  I've got to go to bed.</p>

a good way to learn about ghandi is to read Freedom at Midnight.  a big thick book about the british colonization and eventual expulsion from india.<br>

<p>My computer seems to be fixed!</p>

<p>New memory card, new CD/DVD, new motherboard!</p>

<p>And it was all free.  You know why?  Cause the machine was in
warranty by 11 days. <em>eleven.</em></p>

<p>So I've basically got 11 days to play A LOT on my computer and see
if it work work works super well.</p>

<p>From now on, I plan to drop my computer less often.</p>

<p class=date>4:27pm</p>

<p>He replaced the memory first, thinking that was the whole problem.
I didn't care what had been the problem, but felt relieved to have my
computer working again.</p>

<p>I was *more* relieved when it started to fuck up again while I was
there.  Oh thank goodness.  He thought it was the LCD and said it
would take an hour to fix.  I was like, "no problem des" though I
didn't think it was the LCD.</p>

<p>Ah; I figured out how to prove it wasn't the LCD and plugged in an
auxillary monitor, which also did not receive a signal.  Fucked around
with it a bit and he said "logic board"</p>

<p>Music to my ears.</p>

<p>I felt amazingly patient while watching him systematically remove
and replace and remove and replace different things (mostly screws); I
was just happy to get the computer fixed.</p>

<p>Yay Cory for encouraging me to persevere in Japan and not ship it
back to the US for repair.  It might have ended up past the warranty
deadline had I sent it home.  Whew!!!</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Oh, make that 90 days I have to bang around on the computer; the
shop's work is warranted for that long.  Rock on.  Even janette will
be here before the warranty runs out.</p>

<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol type="a">
<li><p>I'm in Japan.  This is my 103rd day here.  Pooh that I didn't
get my Days In Japan counter on my site before my 100th day, but now
that I have <em>Unlimited Wireless Internet Access</em> at the
apartment, I can spend some time to get that working.</p></li>

<li><p>I just got my computer back and fixed today after it broke
about 2 weeks ago it seems.  Week and a half maybe.  So thankful to
Cory for encouraging me to get it fixed in Japan instead of giving up
when I got brushed off the first time I tried.</p></li>

<li><p>Computer was under warranty so I got a new motherboard, new
memory, new CD/DVD drive.  That fucking rocks.  Now I can watch the
Futurama CDs that Fred sent me!  Whooo hooo!  And 8 Mile.  And Dirty
Third II.</p></li>

<li><p>My private students have given me a break today and tomorrow.
Both Shin and Fumi called me yesterday and said they couldn't meet for
whatever reasons.   That's cool; gives me more time to fuck around
online.</p></li>

<p>Oh, and I've cancelled my lessons with Koko's mom.  I cancelled
with her last week so that I could hang out with Rie, and I asked her
about tomorrow and she gave me a Japanese maybe which is an English,
"naw man I'm too fuckin' busy" so I cancelled the class and all
subsequent classes.  Realistically, she shouldn't have to cover for
her daughter anyway.</p>

<li><p>And next week is the last Tuesday class until the first Tuesday
of September.  So this opens up my schedule in the mornings on Tuesday
and Wednesday to do whatever I want.  I wonder what that will be.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm hating Nova a lot; mostly when it's busy.  Nova doesn't
care about its students; it cares about making money.  I heard a rumor
today that there was a copyright suit or some shit about the book that
Nova is using... and that it was originally written (get this) in
Spanish (which seems to explain the high incidence of Spanish names
and cities in the book) and the result of the suit includes Nova is
required to use this and only this book for ever and ever amen.</p>

<p>Now this is a rumor, but it sure is interesting.</p>

<p>Oh, and allegedly, the book we're using is copyright 1983.</p>

<p>Not allegedly (I can vouch for it), it's out of date, with old
pictures and such.</p></li>

<li><p>Frank is watching <em>The Sopranos</em> behind me.  TV is
dumb.  I'm moving.</p></li>

<li><p>Oh so back to Nova.  I hate working there when it's busy.  And
other times.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been to Hakone twice (once alone, once with Rie), but I've
not been anywhere else outside of Tokyo.</p></li>

<li><p>Might go to Yomiuriland tomorrow.  Or maybe the amusement
park-like thing near the Tokyo Dome. I don't know what it's called.</p></li>

<li><p>Oh.  Over the past couple of days I have been reading a short
book on the history of Japan.   This book has made me wonder what the
hell I'm doing with my life since i'm not (or don't seem to be)
establishing imperial governments, nor moving capitals to new cities
nor building shrines or huge statues...  None of that history book
stuff.  Why not?  What am I doing wrong?  What do famous people do
each day?</p>

<p>I came up with a good buddhist (?) response to that: Who is
famous?</p>

<p>Another thing I noticed:  I'm living at the speed of life and not
the speed of biography.</p></li>

<p>Super duper uper looper special thanks to janette for getting my
computer registered with apple's protection plan.</p>

<p>Holy cow somehow I have switched this keyboard to have all the keys
in the right spot. So now I can type "quotes" and 'apostrophes' and
:colons: and _underscores_ without having to find them visually.</p>

<p>Magic happens.</p>

<p>Leaving the internet cafe, I rode by Miho's, (a restaurant with a
waitress so friendly that we named it after her (they call their
restaurant Hiro's, but we call it Miho's), we being Frank and Matty,
and I picked it up from them.) to make sure I knew where it was
located. I intended to take Shin (and Rie) there last week, but I
couldn't remember where it was.</p>

<p>So I found it this week and while bicycling across the river, a
smiling face came the other direction and was all, <em>HI!</em> and I
was running her through my facial recognition process and was amazed
to realize she was Miho!</p>

<p>How totally incredible!  I've only seen her twice, both times at
the restaurant (yes, I've been there twice and I couldn't find it a
third time.  (equally incredible)) and she totally recognized me!</p>

<p>I was like, "check it yo, I'm planning to come see you tonight!"
and she was of course delighted as she seems to be by anything and
everything, so it was all just great great great.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>At Miho's I suddenly realized that though I had planned to pay for
dinner, I didn't have enough cash cause I had paid for shinkansen
tickets yesterday (6500 yen) and hadn't tucked into my wallet the cash I
got from Aki today for tutoring her.</p>

<p>Hmmm..  Maybe it won't be all that expensive.  Maybe I can practice
letting the blood drain out of my face in embarassment when I open my
wallet. I released the problem.</p>

<p>Later, Shin offered to pay for the meal via "dinner is always on
me."</p>

<p>I saw an easy out, and I was like "I will never turn down a free
meal" and left it at that.  But when it was actually time to go, he
paid me for the tutoring (3000 yen) and I was like, "but *I* will pay for
the meal."</p>

<p>He goes, "this time only."</p>

<p>"Okay."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>At the same time that I'm embarassed by the notion of the West
enforcing such a fucked up language as English on the world, I'm
thankful to benefit from my fluency.</p>

<p>I can update now, but I'm using this wacked out Japanese keyboard
with all the keys in the wrong places.  (Not all the keys.)</p>

<p>This is the second or third time I've had a problem here, and began
to get stuck in a downward spiral about how to solve it.  In this case
I was completely focused on FIX THE COMPUTER, when really I just want
to make updates.</p>

<p>Thinking around the problem, I realized I have other solutions to
this refined problem.</p>

<p>But fuck all that; I've got Japanese to study now.  When my
computer gets fixed, I may write/transcribe stories from these past
days, including my best day so far in Japan, which was yesterday.  But
that day has thoroughly ended and I want the memories to sit gently
before I write about it.</p>

<p>Thanks to janette and Fred for their help resolving this computer
crisis.  :-)</p>

mom asked me to type this for you since i'm a faster typer than she.

hi today is the day that i covertly did not write any comments in
most students' files that i taught today
and. uh. after work cory showed me the ________ door on top of hiroshi
station where i bought a telphone for the new apartment phone
number. yay. and found out that the phone works. yay.
and then went with janis j-a-n-i-s and cory and clayton and mike to a
park and slid down the slide with those little rollers on it and
climbed across the top of the swing set -or walked across it- <b>and</b> did
the little fucking bronco coil spring thing sideways trying to get my
center of gravity back on top of the horse and when i climbed some
archway thing cory <b>and</b> clayton got the five spring loaded fucking
broncos to buck back and forth really fast and then clayton and cory
tried to bow as fast as they were bucking. it was very funny. and i
got home and called janette and it was great and then my computer
died. and so i left a message on her machine and she transcribed
it. it was great. thanks bye.
</pre>

    With Love

nanotechnology and invasion of privacy and computers and fuckin'
everything.  So cool!</p>

<p>During work we had a free lesson and yammered philosophy about God
