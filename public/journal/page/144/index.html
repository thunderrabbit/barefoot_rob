<p>They wanted when where I could type &ldquo;5 * 6 / 3&rdquo; into a field and
evaluate it, but I chose to go RPN on them.</p>

<p>I was a bit late to lesson with Sarupapa tonight on account of not
having been to this particular location before, getting lost on the
way there, and being late to start heading that direction because I
was begging the Softbank guy to give me the code to let me change my
phone number to a new carrier.</p>

<p>Once I decided to dump Softbank, I had to call them to get a code
to authorize the new carrier to take control of the number.</p>

<p>The poor kid had to read some sort of checklist, explaining the date
at which I could freely change my contract (which I already knew), the
cancellation fee which I already knew, the phone transfer fee which I
already knew, and one more thing which took me a while to understand.</p>

<pre><code>Your number is the head of the family calling plan, so please let
me know which of the other two numbers in your family calling plan
should be the new number.
</code></pre>

<p>Uh, I have no idea what you&rsquo;re talking about; just give me the
transfer authorization code.</p>

<p>After about 5 rounds of this, with me growing more and more frustrated
and wondering wtf he was on about, I kinda figured it out.  They
believe the other two numbers are in my family; that they are being
used.  One of them is Soness&rsquo;s number, and I&rsquo;ve called it plenty of
times recently.  The other number, I have no fricken idea what it is,
and I&rsquo;m sure I haven&rsquo;t called it recnently.</p>

<p>But between these two numbers, I am supposed to chose one to carry on
as the head of the non-existent family.</p>

<p>I was like, &ldquo;fine the first one; whatever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Okay, here is your transfer number 8675309 something something and I
was like, &ldquo;blah thank you&rdquo; and headed off (late) to my lesson with
Sarupapa.</p>

<h2 id="22-36-tuesday-14-june-2016-jst">22:36 Tuesday 14 June 2016 JST</h2>

<p>Today after work at CB, I met Lin in Shinjuku to look at options for
mobile wifi.</p>

<p>Went to a shop where blue eyed Lexy explained which phones were
waterproof.  Talking to the guy upstairs, though, I couldn&rsquo;t
understand why he kept saying that my 3G usage wasn&rsquo;t a good way to
estimate my future 4G usage, so we left.</p>

<p>Went across the street and looked briefly at a shop advertising Tokyo
Free or something, but their prices were only for data, not voice, so
we moved to the next shop.</p>

<p>The next shop featured staff from Softbank who helped me determine
that my current Softbank plan isn&rsquo;t good for my usage.  I&rsquo;m paying $70
for XYZ but using XYC so I&rsquo;m paying an extra 4000 yen per month.  That
sucks.</p>

<p>But ya know what sucks more?  I called Softbank, and they were like,
&ldquo;yeah you want to cancel?  Well, your next cancellation period starts
next year, in December (i.e. 18 months from now).&rdquo;</p>

<p>And?</p>

<p>&ldquo;So if ya want to cancel now, ya gotta pay 10,000 yen cancelation fee,
on top of the 3000 yen transfer-yer-phone-number fee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Really?  I&rsquo;ve been a customer of Softbank since back in the day.  I
got an iPhone 3 with them, and that was after my clamshell phone which
I had had since way back.</p>

<p>So why do they for me to pay $100 to leave?  Because they can and they
dgaf about customer loyalty or the cost of finding replacement
customers.  So, dear Softbank, I hope you enjoy the $130, and I hope
it&rsquo;s worth it for you to find another customer.</p>

<p>My iPhone 4S, <em>Little Blue Monkey</em> is headed for retirement.</p>

<p>I have a new waterproof Android 6 AQUOS phone. Haven&rsquo;t thought of a
name for it yet. Unlimited calling and 5GB internet per month for
$90. Let&rsquo;s see how long I like it.</p>

<p>I was stopped by the cops in our new neighborhood, ostensibly because
I was barefoot, but possibly because I&rsquo;m ostensibly not Japanese.</p>

<p>They asked if I had shoes (no), if I was okay (yes), where I was going
(work), what was my job (programmin&rsquo;), where was my job (ebisu), where
was my crib (right over there).  I offered that I had been barefoot
for 7 years in the US and going on year 3 (or is it 4) here, and I was
on TV recently, blah blah.</p>

<p>A woman walking by asked them if I needed shoes; I told her no but
thank you very much.</p>

<p>The cops wrote down my infos and said everything was fine, but just to
be careful for glass.  Will do!</p>

<p>Honestly, they were both quite friendly.  One even asked to see the
bottom of my feet, and said the TV show I was on is one he often
watches.  Any ill will I&rsquo;m projecting is due to mass and social media.</p>

<p>I still made it to my train on time.  The end.</p>
