<p>This morning Sally and I went for a walk to the lake and I
discovered they had built new playground equipment on the top of the
hill where previously there had been only two teeter totters and
swings and maybe a something to climb on.  The equipment is almost all
new now, with some toys I hadn't previously seen.</p>

<p>One is a bar with two lightbulb shapes hanging upside down.
Handles on the lightbulbs allow people to hang from them, and there's
a spring in them allowing some bouncing action.  Not too exciting, but
unique.</p>

<p>Then they have a handle thing on wheels that one can hang and roll
to the other side of the track (about 6 feet) but each end has a
pneumatic thing to make it slow down vaguely more smoothly than just
<em>kang</em> into metal or <em>bonk</em> into a rubber bumper.</p>

<p>Walked along the slanted wall and saw the spillway (still spilling
but rather shallow compared to some nights ago), then back toward
home.</p>

<p>Oh, I am surprised that I hadn't noticed until today that one of
the jogging trails is built where railroad tracks used to be.  It's so
obvious that I'm surprised I didn't notice before.</p>

<p>This morning Josephine bounded into bed, "look!  I'm awake before
you!" and Janette, Josephine and I had a tickle-fight-wrestling-match,
which was pretty darn fun until Josephine lost her biggest nail..
"Oh, that was your cocaine nail; I'm so sorry.."  Tanner helped her
clip it off cleanly.  Little bit ripped past the skin part.</p>

<p>Joel came to watch what all the commotion was about as Janette
played "push Rob off the bed" and I played "tickle Janette on the bed"
Joel chose not to join, but just to watch.</p>

<p>Janette's neighbor Barbara had called to say she had to go to work,
asked if Janette would go visit her house to make sure the roof
workers left with only their stuff.</p>

<p>I just spent some time chatting with Ryan, giving him some input on
how he can better his <a
href="https://boyinthemachine.tripod.com">comic site, Boy In The
Machine</a>, which is quite bizarre and quite funny for those who like
bizarre, or who like to read a good rant or two about religion or
life.</p>

<p>I'm super glad that I can support him in his quest for magnificence
in web presence, so he can go to his mailbox and shout, "I'm a dim dam
genius!" and money will appear.</p>

<p>Argh</p>

<p>I'm like totally frizzled on what I'm supposed to be doing.  Gotta
list a mile long of important but not urgent things to do.</p>

<p>!) Mail guitar pin to Bryn</p>

<p>@) send out email to people inviting them to my 12000th day, but
this is a balancing act between waiting until I have information from
Maggie about when the room is reserved and other specifics, and not
waiting too long to send out the message, and collecting all the
addresses to whom I wish to send invites, etc etc.  Plus, ironically,
I'm having som trouble getting my emailer to work the way I think it
should.  I guess it's not designed to mass mail people.</p>

<p>and then I get stuck no longer writing out my list, but working on
this email list.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>alright.  I think I got that working.  I need to call Mags and see
if she has more info for me.</p>

<p>Janette and Hart's mom (Mary Jane) and I just went for a walk for
about an hour.  I went barefoot, and my feet held up pretty well.
Nice warm blood vessels down in my soles prove every cell thrives.</p>

<p>Mostly they talked about their respective kids and looked at houses
as we passed them.  Lots of old glass windows with wobbly reflections
in them.  One street had particularly clean windows on bottom and top
floors.  I imagined a tall person lived on the block, did a
neighborhood service by cleaning them weekly.</p>

<p>Near the conclusion of our walk, I thought we were way over where
we weren't.  If Janette had bet me $10 on which way was home, she
woulda won.</p>

<p>The kittens went to a thrift store and came back with Cranium, the
four team game that pits different random talent-ish things against
one another.  Janette, Mikey and I were winning pretty handily.  The
other two teams seemed to be fighting pretty handily.  Were we finding
the limits of YRUU comraderie?  7 days together in basically one house
might stretch such bonds.</p>

<p>The game was abandoned before finished.  "this is a dumb game..."
Tanner, Mikey, Janette, Josephine and I played a couple rounds non
competitively, just to practice the skills: drawing with eyes closed,
modeling with clay, etc.</p>

<p>Now some of them are going to a different thrift store, and some of
the others are going to play disc.  I'm choosing not to; it's too
cold!  And practically dark.</p>

<p class=dream>Someone speaking some dialog for a movie, maybe Sean,
but she was a girl.  We were filming a movie and basically didn't have
enough script so were trying to go over old script again in a
different way to make it seem longer.</p>

<p class=dream>I woke up and Joel was beside me.  He had been sleeping
in a weird position; weirder than Marty McFly in <em>Back to the
Future</em>.  I talked to him a bit, asking him how he slept; he said
just fine, and then he was gone and I was talking to Ricky Shaw, of
Shaw Chevron down in Houston.  He was fine as well and looked forward
to seeing me at my party.</p>

<p>Then I woke up for real.</p>

<p>What is the fucking deal with Bush and foreign relations?</p>

<p>He's all riling up troops to go fight in Iraq when the UN is all,
"we found nothing" and Bush still wants to go fight and 'liberate' the
Iraqis?  And then what?  try to fucking take over their country under
the guise of aid and westernize it and end up destroying another
culture with our white plague?</p>

<p>And at the same time Korea is all, "hey yo we got bombs!" and Bush
is all, "oh, we'd like to be diplomatic about this."</p>

<p>What The Fuck???</p>

<p>Is Bush mad cause Saddam was going to kill his dad?  Yo dubya, call
your daddy; his ass is still alive.  Go shoot a bunch of fucking deer
on your ranch and let diplomacy work with Iraq *and* with Korea.  Be
wise, not a fucking war monger.  Let the UN discern weapons in Iraq.</p>

<p>I'm not all brilliant about this shit yet, but dammm; this
situation is pretty fucked up.</p>

<p>Saw the Japanese version of <em>The Ring</em>, which they just
called <em>Ring</em>.  If you've seen our version, stick with that.</p>

<p>The Japanese version wasn't scary at all compared to our version.
There was only one (1) thing that the Japanese version did more
scarily than the US version.  And it was actually just creepy or
spooky: to keep from dying in the American version, one had to copy
the tape.  In Japanese version, one had to copy *and* show the video
to someone else.</p>

<p>But the Japanese version didn't have any horses, didn't show the
girl in an insane asylum, didn't visit the girl who saw her friend
die, didn't have the dad kill himself, didn't show where the girl had
been kept, and the video itself was way shorter.</p>

<p>Hahaa now the kittens are talking about their "irrational" fears of
dark, boogey man, vampires, peeing in bathrooms with windows..</p>

<p>"Shit!  Both your bathrooms have windows in them!  I'm going to go
pee outside.."</p>

<p>"hey don't say all that scary stuff around Josephine, you might
scare her."</p>

<p>"Oh I think that while she's got all these big hairy boys around
her she'll be okay."</p>

<p>"hey, just because we're bigger doesn't mean our minds are
stronger; we're scared too."</p>
