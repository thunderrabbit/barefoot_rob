<p>My phone is a slow as year 2000 internet; I guess it is throttle
because I went over the allotted bandwidth.  bah.</p>

<p>If that&rsquo;s true, I wonder what put me so far over the limit this month.</p>

<p>Thanks to Rohini for inviting all the beautiful people who joined the
Gunma adventure staying at Renee&rsquo;s place.</p>

<p>Yesteray morning Lisa led yoga and later in the day she played an
instrument with four strings.  We tried doing some chanting with it,
but no one knew the chants.</p>

<p>We went to the caves apparently dug by hand with a bunch of different
statues (33?) different representations of the goddess of mercy or
something.  I mostly talked to Jill in there; we enjoyed wondering
what it would have been like back in the day to walk in some of the
places which now have barriers.  Some doors in the walls were unlocked
so we peered inside some dusty rooms, some of which had water in the
bottom.  Would be funny to get a photo inside, but too spooky to do
so.</p>

<p>So great to get healing treatment from Dr Wada and his wife Yoko who
can move her arms, but seems not able to talk nor move anything below
her shoulders.  Jorge reported he could feel Dr Wada&rsquo;s precise work; I
reported that my legs rotated toward the left while Dr Wada was
treating me, but nowhere near my physical body.</p>

<p>Talking about shungite, someone spouted some scientific hooha like
&ldquo;this mineral is from the edge of the universe&rdquo; and &ldquo;NASA has detected
this mineral on 67 different planets&rdquo;.. or something to that
effect.. I was like tf are you talking about.</p>

<p>During the treatments, Eucharia taught us something like group improv
games, which might be good in some classes with students who act shy
around each other.  If I ever teach in public schools, they will be
great for those classes.</p>

<p>We then played Zoom Zoom Zap, a game Rohini taught, and then did
variants with not showing our teeth (while saying thos words) and then
an animal noise variant, where the same noise kept it going and a new
noise reversed the direction.</p>

<p>I suggested the Seven Game (each person in circle says the next number
but numbers with 7 or multiples of 7 require a clap and reverse
direction) which we played until we got past 29.</p>

<p>At the onsen, Alison taught a game Don&rsquo;t Say Twenty where two people
take turns saying up to three consecutive numbers:</p>

<p>1 2, 3 4 5, 6 7, 8 9 10, 11 12 13, 14 15, 16 17 18, 19, 20 with the
person who says 20 being the loser.</p>

<p>I kinda know the rule, but Alison can still usually beat me.  Walked
back from the onsen with Alison and Jill, continuing the play the
Don&rsquo;t Say Twenty game.  I had told Jill briefly about Silent Football,
and was so happy to play Silent Football after the onsen last night
with Jill, Rokki, and Sandra!  We might might just might play again
sometime.</p>

<p>Last night ended up being late due to Dr Wada finishing so late; I
helped Yoko down the stairs at 1 AM and went with Mo to help Yoko up
the stairs at her house.  It was easy enough, and so easy to see how
much love they have for each other.</p>

<p>Renee fell asleep while finishing up a prayer treatment thing last
night, facing me and put her hands in prayer position while sitting on
the couch and after a while just slumped over and I was like ummm and
then she woke up.  Poor her, so tired after 10 hours of healing and
then the blessing of giving me a healing.  So nice, but I just do not
want to deal with the time just sliding away.</p>

<p>I lay down to sleep at 2:45am.</p>

<p>Will led a 20+ minute chant for about 15 of us in a room this morning
while waiting at 9am for 8am breakfast to be prepared.  It was shorter
than I felt like it could have been; I was just getting into it.</p>

<p>Late Dr Wada put us at late breakfast and way behind schedule so
tempers were up this morning as Rohini wanted to get as much time in
Gunma as possible and Renee wanted to count the money as diligently as
possible. I was so moe joe that I just wanted to gtfo and fuck the
extra 1000 yen that they miscounted in their favor.  They recounted
and I ended up not paying extra in that regard, but dang I just wanted
to run away.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m talking about how I cried after Renee told Rohini to shut up this
morning and I felt like we were being treated like little kids while
Renee goes &ldquo;the information is that I want to address everyone to find
out what I want to know before telling you what you want to know&rdquo;
which I understand she thought was related to the answer we wanted,
but was not.  Will saw me walk away from the group and he came to
offer a hug while I cried.</p>

<p>I did <em>not</em> smile for the picture in front of their house.  I just
closed my eyes and let my face feel sad because that is how I felt at
the moment.  Fuck fake documentation of photos. I felt like fucking
shit at the tail end of the weekend.</p>

<p>So happy to go swim in the lake!  I was invited to ride in the fun van
so I joined them and we stayed by the lake after two cars headed to
Haruna shrine.  So refreshing to just be like bbbllllaaahhhhhhhh and
splash into the water. Fun fun fun fun!!</p>

<p>Played Ceiling Wall Floor in the yellow van for a bit, using people&rsquo;s
names as fodder.  I used Jill&rsquo;s name a lot and she was it a lot.</p>

<p>Super thanks to Steve and Sophie for letting me ride with them; they
dropped me off at Takasaki station, and dropped off Fukiko somewhere
closer to her place.. Great to talk to him about slightly old school
communication technology SSL SLIP POTS..  not that I know details
about any of them, but I remember using them back in the day.</p>

<p>I wrote all the above while on the bullet train from Takasaki; we are
now arriving in Ueno.  Though I originally bought a ticket for Omiya,
I will go one more stop to Tokyo; according to Google Maps that is the
fastest way to go (well, fastest I can afford), and I should be home
by 9pm.</p>

<p>On my way to Gunma today, I stopped by Joanna&rsquo;s to install a ceiling
fan which she had ordered.  She took me to a restaurant which served
everything on (round) tortillas with the sides folded to make them
square.</p>

<p>Great to see her again and hear about how things have been going!
Been a long time since The Artist&rsquo;s Way back in the day.</p>

<p>While I was walking out of Ueno station, a tall man and I did the
foreigner nod and then he said he had seen me on TV (for being
barefoot).  We shook hands and talked for a bit about the importance
of doing one&rsquo;s own thing.</p>

<p>He said, &ldquo;I respect you,&rdquo; and I should have said if he sees
respectability in me, that means it&rsquo;s in him, too.</p>

<p>I gotta stop and chat a bit longer to people who say HI like that, but
I dunno what to say.  Maybe I will ask if they live in Tokyo.</p>

<p>I ate lunch with Esther in Ueno station before she moves to Okinawa.  It
sounds like she&rsquo;s found a good job down there; I hope it works out
well!</p>

<p>Lesson at Zavas featured a high level discussion of two different
peering arrangements (p2p vs centralized) and the concept of
protocols.  I was planning to talk about Bitcoin, but the word &ldquo;peer&rdquo;
in the whitepaper started the discussion we ended up having.</p>

<p>I had a distinct sense of inadequacy when describing layers of
protocols that make up the internet, but that may be because when I
hear the phrase &ldquo;the internet&rdquo; in my mind, my mind replies with &ldquo;the
internet is made of cats, the internet is made of cats, cats! cats!
cats!&rdquo; before I can think of anything else.</p>

<p>Even so, I explained how centralized sites are targets for attack and
how they are &ldquo;free&rdquo; because they can sell our data.  I listed
bittorrent, tor, mumble, pgp, gpg as peer to peer protocols.  I guess
SMTP is one as well.  Not sure about Mumble, actually.</p>

<p>Worked at AK today for a 2 hour lesson.  Pretty great because the
students are all talkative and asked questions and such.  Chatted a
bit and then showed them an article I used with other class.  This
class had much higher comprehension of the article&hellip; which is good,
but shows me just how too-high the article was for my other class.</p>

<p>After the lesson, Eiko walked me back nearly to the security gate,
asking about PB a bit.</p>
