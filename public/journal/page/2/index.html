<p>I&rsquo;m on a bus!  I&rsquo;m on a bus!  Everyone, look at me; I&rsquo;m on a nearly
empty bus, headed to Narita, headed to Seattle to see Colleenie Bean
Dawg for a day doing touristy things in the city and then having pizza
at their crib.</p>

<p>(The bus is now waiting at a light like 5 minutes from my house.  So
funny how transit works on this planet.)</p>

                        <p>Hide and Akiko from 7pm class each needed to make up some lessons, so
stayed for the 8pm class featuring Misato and Tatsuya.</p>

<p>I think it worked pretty well; they had not met each other, and they
are all pretty much similar personalities so I figured they would get
along fine.</p>

<p>After self intros, most of the time they talked about Akiko&rsquo;s challenging business trip
to Hydrabad, India.  Most of the rest of the time we talked about Hide&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p>Well it has taken longer than I wanted, but I learned that I can get
lots of code samples by searching GitHub.  For some reason dredging
through the documentation did not work for me.  It&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s tons
of pieces and various similar words and my little brain is like
ummmmmmmmmmmmm</p>

<p>but digging through Github like
<a href="https://github.com/search?p=6&amp;q=where+site.RegularPages+%22Type%22+%22in%22+.Site.Params.mainSections&amp;type=Code">https://github.com/search?p=6&amp;q=where+site.RegularPages+%22Type%22+%22in%22+.Site.Params.mainSections&amp;type=Code</a></p>

<p>or
<a href="https://github.com/search?q=paginator+Paginate+internal+pagination&amp;type=Code">https://github.com/search?q=paginator+Paginate+internal+pagination&amp;type=Code</a></p>

<p>and boom lots of examples and I got it sorted in less than an hour.</p>

<p>Compared to days and days and weeks omg I would say that is worth
doing first next time.</p>

<p>HOPPEEEFFFUllYyyy I can get my site up before I leave for the US.</p>

<p>ps thanks to this page for cracking it open for me.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/sizucca/sizucca.com/blob/ab66fae0008761e890460d482dea0f1e9b238c1e/themes/blog-theme/layouts/index.html">https://github.com/sizucca/sizucca.com/blob/ab66fae0008761e890460d482dea0f1e9b238c1e/themes/blog-theme/layouts/index.html</a></p>

<p>Using $paginator instead of $pages as the variable name helped a lot.
I guess Hugo looks for that variable by default in the pagination
bits.</p>

<p>The site is failing on Netlify for some reason, but I set up a new
Netlify site that will hopefully get me sorted.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s not why I&rsquo;m writing.</p>

<p>I wondered why my existing server was not serving the site; I set it
up to be updated whenever I push the public directory to the server.</p>

<p>(check check check) ohhh there&rsquo;s your problem!</p>

<p>It makes a difference if I WIPE THE <code>.git/</code> DIRECTORY by WIPING the
<code>public/</code> directory to debug all this. hahah oops.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s not why I&rsquo;m writing &hellip;</p>

<p>Good morning!</p>

<p>I got a surprise from Vimeo this morning.</p>

<pre><code>Dear Rob Nugen,

Your account has been removed by the Vimeo Staff for violating our Guidelines.

    Reason: You cannot upload rips of movies, music, television, viral
    videos, or any other content that you did not create.

For more information on our content and community policies, please
visit: https://vimeo.com/guidelines.     If you believe this was an
error, please reply to this message as soon as possible to
explain. (Please be aware that Vimeo moderators take action as
violations come to our attention. ‚ÄúI see other people doing it‚Äù is not
a valid explanation.)

Otherwise, we hope that you find a video platform better suited to
your needs.

   Sincerely,
   Vimeo Staff
</code></pre>

<p>My reply:</p>

<pre><code>Hello

I have been informed that my account has been terminated due to
violating your Guidelines.¬† It would be easier to defend myself if you
tell me which video is in violation.

But here is my defense:¬† ¬†I don't upload stuff I don't create.

I have been working on Marble Track 3 for years, and have uploaded
some same videos on my YouTube account and my Vimeo account in the
process of considering actually using Vimeo for my main content.

I guess your bots detected identical videos on both platforms?¬† No
that couldn't be it.¬† Is there a bit of music in the background of one
video?¬† Maybe, but it's not the focus of any of my videos.

Again, let me know what video it was, and we can discuss a better way
to go forward than terminating my account.

My main proof, without knowing what your bots found: I don't live for
fake internet points.¬† I only upload stuff I make.
https://www.marbletrack3.com¬†

Ohhh maybe your bots caught repetition in two of my own videos??¬†
Marbletrack3 is a stop motion video which takes hours to make even a
single second of content.¬† I have uploaded clips that are increasingly
longer as I work on the project.

See my YouTube channel for what I mean http://channel.marbletrack3.com

Best regards
Rob

And PS I just signed up for PRO, so I'd like my money back if you
going to terminate my account.

PS PS just to prove I, Rob Nugen, control marbletrack3.com I will post
this on the site:

<p>Vimeo does not allow you to upload videos ripped from TV, movies, or anywhere else. The golden rule of Vimeo is that you are only permitted to upload videos that you created. The video titled &ldquo;<a href="http://feet.robnugen.com">just my feet</a>&rdquo; was the clip found in violation of our guidelines.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre happy to provide a list of your videos, which we‚Äôll send to the primary address on your account. The file you receive will contain the following information:</p>

<ul>
<li>Video ID</li>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also gone ahead and issued a refund of your Vimeo Plus subscription. Please allow 3-5 business days for the funds to post to your account.</p>

<p>Hi Dan</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>

<p>Ah, yes, I can understand &ldquo;Just My Feet&rdquo; is in violation.</p>

<p>Can we remove that video, consider me educated, and reinstate my account?</p>

<p>My focus now is Marble Track 3, not old TV shows I was on.</p>

<p>Best,
Rob</p>

will be in the same location in Dogenzaka.</p>

<p>It will be my first time to meet Yuna face to face!  We have been
doing lessons online for a while (since July 2018), so we know each
other pretty well, but we have never met!</p>

<p>Currently 4 people are scheduled to attend, which is better than the

next time. :-)</p>

<p>My website stopped working recently.  More accurately,
<a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> stopped rendering the /blog and /journal
portions of my website.  The last time it worked was 2 weeks ago.  I
noticed that my local version of Hugo had gotten updated (*) and
checked the releases.. sure enough there was a change to something
related to that I had tweaked regarding indices.</p>

<p>The problem languished for a while until I remembered that <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/04/11/netlify-plus-hugo-0.20-and-beyond/">Netlify
allows choosing which version of Hugo to use</a>.</p>

<p>That, along with building every branch, allowed me to test at exactly
<em>which</em> version of Hugo my site stopped being rendered properly.</p>

<p>I had already created a mini version of my site, so I whipped up a
shell script <code>netlify.sh</code>to slap a bunch of different branches with different
versions of Hugo requested.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash

VERSION=$1
BRANCH=hugo${VERSION//\./}
FILE=netlify.toml

echo &quot;version $VERSION&quot;
echo &quot;branch $BRANCH&quot;

git checkout master
git branch -f $BRANCH
sleep 1
git checkout $BRANCH

sed -i '' s/&quot;0.54.0&quot;/&quot;$VERSION&quot;/g $FILE

git add $FILE

sleep 1

git commit -m &quot;Hugo $VERSION

to narrow down when it stopped working&quot;

sleep 1

git push origin $BRANCH

sleep 1

git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>sleep</code> commands are there to keep git from locking itself out of the directory.</p>

<p>This allowed me to run</p>

<p><code>./netlify.sh 0.45</code></p>

<p>where 0.45 is a version number I wanted to test.</p>

<p>I thereby created a bunch of branches&hellip;</p>

<pre><code>* 77836e3 (origin/hugo0471, hugo0471) Hugo 0.47.1

<p>And Netlify quickly created all of them so I could figure out which
ones worked and which ones did not.</p>

</ul>

<p>etc etc</p>

<p><em>None of them worked!</em></p>

<pre><code>(‚òâ_‚òâ)
</code></pre>

<p>(*) The fact that the local version had gotten updated automagically
should have been a clue that the auto-updating Hugo had <em>not</em> caused
the problem.  I had no idea when the updates happened, but the problem
suddenly started, and I assumed an update was the cause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, boys, I was wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="it-was-my-mistake-all-along">it was my mistake all along</h3>

<p>In an attempt to fix my top page, I had tweaked this and that, where
this and that are the main repo site, and sub-module theme,
respectively.  During the process, I did not notice that I had also
broken the entire site. Part of the not noticing was due to the
current way I have Hugo set up, it does not wipe the output <code>public/</code>
directory before creating the site.  (Although I intended to and
thought I had activated that option.)</p>

<p>here&rsquo;s where it gets tricky.  My current site consists of multiple
submodules, the two mentioned above, a couple others which have not
changed in months (years), and my journal entries, which currently has
8500+ files.  There are enough journal files that when I try to run
Hugo on my site locally, it crashes with too many files open.  I
cannot let Hugo watch for changes so I have to restart Hugo each time
I make a change.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see if I can offload that task to Netlify.</p>

<p>Basic idea:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start with my local website repository</li>
<li>Wipe all files from the public/ directory</li>
<li>Copy the remaining files to a new directory</li>
<li>git checkout abcdef123 &ndash;recurse-submodules</li>
<li>Create a branch</li>
<li>Push to Netlify</li>
</ol>

<p>or</p>

<ol>
<li>Wipe most of the journal entries</li>
<li>Run the code locally</li>
</ol>

<h5 id="12-56-wednesday-25-september-2019-jst">12:56 Wednesday 25 September 2019 JST</h5>

<p>Getting closer.  I made a script I called <code>commitlify.sh</code></p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash

COMMIT=$1
BRANCH=hugo_${COMMIT//\./}

echo &quot;commit $COMMIT&quot;
echo &quot;branch $BRANCH&quot;

rm -rf public/

ls public/

git checkout $COMMIT --recurse-submodules

git branch -f $BRANCH

sleep 1

git checkout $BRANCH

sleep 1

git push origin $BRANCH

sleep 1

hugo server -w=0
</code></pre>

<p>It does a similar thing as the previous script, but deals with
submodules being aligned with the main repo&rsquo;s HEAD.  The last line
tells Hugo to serve the site, but not to monitor it for changes.</p>

<p>This is fine for now because I am just poking around to see which
commits were breaking commits.</p>

<h5 id="21-58">21:58</h5>

<p>I found a <a href="https://bitbucket.org/thunderrabbit/purehugo/commits/16559a8ffa3ec74f57af7398a90f259f41972675">breaking commit that used to be a genius commit</a>, but
apparently its genius did not survive changes in Hugo.</p>

<h5 id="00-32-thursday-26-september-2019-jst">00:32 Thursday 26 September 2019 JST</h5>

<p>And now I have gotten enough of the errors out of the system that I
can get Netlify to build <em>something</em> with the repo.  I still do not
have /blog nor /journal indices working, but getting closer.  There
were a couple of commits that did work, so .. oh I can try one now.</p>

<p>Dangit.  There are different errors with some commits I marked as
working in my local setup.</p>

<p>Too tired to work on it now.  good night!</p>

<h5 id="22-20-thursday-26-september-2019-jst">22:20 Thursday 26 September 2019 JST</h5>

<p>Yayyy!!  As of today, I got an <a href="https://new-robnugen-com-fallible-abandoned-58f942.netlify.com">old version of my site</a> working on
Netlify.</p>

<p>Both the
<a href="https://new-robnugen-com-fallible-abandoned-58f942.netlify.com/journal/">journal</a>
and
<a href="https://new-robnugen-com-fallible-abandoned-58f942.netlify.com/blog/">blog</a>
have their own pages, and the top page shows just the blog entries.</p>

<p>The pagination on the top page is messed up, but now that I have
something working, I can ask peeps on the Hugo forum for help on
that.  My attempt to fix that is what broke my site in the first
place.</p>

<p>Okay..  now to get my journal entries and blog entries up to date!</p>

<p>Go to main repo directory</p>

<pre><code>cd ~/journal-hugo
</code></pre>

<p>Keep track of the old master branch</p>

<pre><code>git branch -f old_master c670763
</code></pre>

<p>Move the master branch to the branch that is working now (<a href="https://bitbucket.org/thunderrabbit/journal-hugo/commits/bbfbe552a5a6f8b9337af3ac41ee359250a309df">bbfbe552a5a6f8b9337af3ac41ee359250a309df</a>)</p>

<pre><code>git branch -f master
</code></pre>

<p>It took 45 minutes to deploy before, so this may be up in 45 minutes.
<a href="https://new-robnugen-com-fallible-abandoned-58f942.netlify.com">https://new-robnugen-com-fallible-abandoned-58f942.netlify.com</a></p>

<p>Oh dang, I triggered a deploy by uploading my latest journal without
uploading this latest change.</p>
