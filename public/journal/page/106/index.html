<p>Moe Joe.</p>

<p>CB was like &lsquo;um where are the images in our app?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Turns out the app source hardcodes the image server domain name
instead of reading it from the API the app uses.</p>

<p>Spent 1.5 hours on phone with AWS support trying to get our domain
pointed to CBs new image server.  Ended up doing it at DNS level
because I could not get redirects to work from the server.  I guess
this way is better though, because now I can be pretty certain nothing
will be hitting the old server since DNS no longer points to it.</p>

<p>This is the first time AWS support wasn&rsquo;t able to solve my issue in a
30 minute phone call.</p>

<pre><code>After we stood hand in hand for a while, she said she felt very connected to the forest through me.

I asked if I could bless her with a hug.. after a few moments of hug, I just started to cry. 

&quot;It's so good to see you again.  I have missed you so much.&quot;

Wow.

Thank you.

Thank you for sharing. :) :) :)
Witnessing that gave me such great joy.  Still blissing out vicariously.
Great joy!!

P said to me last night that of all the people in the room he scanned, he hoped YOU would connect.
And he said it a number of times to her in the eve.
Later, she said to him something like, &quot;That one is a Giant Tree...&quot;
Bravo for all the grounding you have done.  Your energy is helping us all.

It reminds me that the call you feel to do the work you are doing is no accident.
May you be ever more empowered and assured that you're on track.

Blessings, Love &amp; Gratitude,

R

<pre><code>Thank you for sharing P's and her thoughts and reactions.  Thank you
for inviting me to connect.  Thank God I didn't let my fear of &quot;being
late&quot; keep me from making that connection!!!

I am still a bit vibraty now thinking about it.

I went home last night ostensibly for my Japanese lesson at midnight
(via Skype).  My teacher speaks English fluently and I spent the first
25 minutes of the lesson describing the experience which itself was
just about 4 minutes of objective time.

insha'allah, I would like to sit with her some more.

<pre><code>Dear FCC,

The FCC should stand up for Internet users by safeguarding net neutrality. 

The FCC should reject Chairman Ajit Pai’s proposal to hand the ISP
monopolies like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&amp;T the authority to create
Internet fast lanes, stripping consumers of the necessary privacy and
access protections we demanded and so recently won.

I’m concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain
types of data or websites because I would like my small business to
have a fair chance of success.

Thankfully, the existing Open Internet rules ensure that ISPs can’t
slow or block consumers’ ability to see certain web services or engage
in data discrimination by charging websites and online service money
to reach consumers faster.

That’s exactly the right balance to ensure the Internet remains a
level playing field that benefits small businesses and consumers as
well as larger players. Chairman Pai’s proposed repeal of the rules
would transform Internet providers into Internet gatekeepers with the
ability to veto new expression and innovation. That’s not how the
Internet was built, and that is not what we want.

The internet should continue to be a place where free speech can
remain free and where people can freely choose what content to
consume.  Each individual website owner can choose their own policy
regarding who can read their content.

However, Chairman Pai's proposal would allow ISPs and wealthy sites to
determine whose content can be read.  This will strength monopoly and
not just discourage, but undermine the creation of new sites.

Thanks for protecting Internet users like me by upholding the existing
Title II net neutrality rules.
</code></pre>

<h2 id="09-13-thursday-11-may-2017-jst">09:13 Thursday 11 May 2017 JST</h2>

<p>And another thing!</p>

<pre><code>It's not just websites that are at risk, it's pure innovation that
is at risk.  When the MPAA tried to block VCRs from production,
they were stifling their own future money-making ability.

There are future technologies about which we cannot even dream.
Please allow them to come to life and trust the future generations
will thank us for ensuring the bounty of creative expression is
guaranteed by law and cultural values.

I urge you to keep Title II net neutrality in place, and safeguard
Internet users like me.

<p>SOGO had their 1 year anniversary party on Saturday night at Womb.  It
was my first time to go to that club and I was worried it would be all
smokey and gross, but perhaps because it was a private party and SOGO
peeps are ostensibly into health and fitness, no one smoked; yay!</p>

<p>Everyone commented that I was wearing shoes for once, but I kicked
them off as the music started bumping after some fun team-bonding SOGO
style exercise activities.  Who can do 25 pushups the fastest?  Who
can do the most pushups in 30 seconds (with a cup balancing on lower
back).</p>

<p>Anyway, great time dancing with Nav, Mike, Rikke (sp), Gurleen (sp)
(who made great eye contact) and the party ended too soon for me to be
tired (3.5 hours) so I encourged Mike and co-workers to walk to
Roppongi.  Only 45 minutes, but the co-workers went barefoot!!  Wow!
We played The Jackie Purdy Game for a bit, and Mike presented some
logic puzzles about prisoners in hats.  I got the first one pretty
quickly</p>

<p>TL;DR: wasted a lot of time today.</p>

<p>Wall of crap:</p>

<p>I somehow confused myself and my vagrant VMs.  The big change I made
was to recreate my <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa</code> keys in my management box.  That
meant I could not connect to the other VMs until I put the public key
in their <code>.ssh/authorized_hosts</code> file, which I did, but then I could
not deploy the sites without giving the new key to bitbucket, and then
I ended up destroying and recreating a VM because for some reason the
&ldquo;exact same&rdquo; (*) deploys that worked before were not working because
they were being run as ubuntu instead of vagrant..  wait what?  How
could they possibly have worked before?  wth is going on fuckit and I
(archived and) wiped the box to recreate it, but <em>still</em> had problems
with the wrong user being used, and <em>then</em> I realied that on top of
all this, when I <code>vagrant ssh ab</code> to get to the ab box from my host, I
was being logged in to the mgmt box.  ffs I have wasted hours on this
so I am now starting new VMs from scratch (after downloading latest
Trusty64 from hashicorp (slower than Christmas here at the office for
some reason (between 57k/s and 200k/s)) and latest VirtualBox and
latest guestadditions so hopefully the mount thing will be fixed this
time.</p>

<p>(*) not exactly the same</p>

<h2 id="19-06-monday-08-may-2017-jst">19:06 Monday 08 May 2017 JST</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s only up to 64% downloaded so I am going to cancel the d/l and
head home.</p>

<p>Today I am going to Yurakucho to see Mika and Kai at an outdoor music
festival.  Kai will attend a concert that starts in 25 minutes.</p>

<p>I am probably planning too long of a day, but after the festival, I
plan to go to Womb for a SOGO event.  Only crummy thing is I have to
wear shoes to the SOGO event.  Not sure if it&rsquo;s a Womb rule or a SOGO
rule.</p>

<p>After upgrading it to Ubuntu 14, I split the FS box into two, and put
one on CB&rsquo;s AWS account so they have control over it.  (<em>cough</em>) and
pay for it.  The AB version we still pay for, but the load is much
lighter.</p>

<p>Since recovering from my little DB restore delimma, I have
instantiated an instance of FS just for AB.  I will move the existing
FS instance to CB&rsquo;s account so they can pay their own way.</p>

<p>While trying to fix the backup process, I destroyed the database by
overwriting with data from April 20th.</p>

<p>Had a good cry, and now am restoring the data from a 1GB backup file.</p>

<p>(It&rsquo;s this file that I guessed would be troublesome in a restore
process, so I wanted to break it up into bits.  Now we get to do the
restore starting with this file.)</p>

<p>Thank goodness it&rsquo;s Golden Week.</p>

<p>I contacted AWS support at 11:02am, and now at 11:40 the restore is in
progress.  Thank goodness for DS&rsquo;s calm and understanding
demeanor&hellip;. (plus understanding of the system!) to help me get going
quickly.</p>

<p>Finished, and confirmed.</p>
