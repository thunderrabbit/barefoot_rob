<p><em>hanging out with Trent Reznor of nine inch nails (still?), I got to really ask him and hear some of his thoughts about stuff. I was like &ldquo;oh I know what I can tell you that&rsquo;s personal, different than just &lsquo;omg I love your music&rsquo; which is true, or I wouldn&rsquo;t be here now, but I feel sad that I didn&rsquo;t try to engaage you personally earlier. I mean I was listening to you in 1986 when Down in It came out.  And actually, I thought the lyrics for the refrain &lsquo;I was up above it&rsquo; were &lsquo;How is everybody?&rsquo; and they entire crowd answers back like ten thousand people screaming yeah [we are great],&rdquo; and he interrupted a bit, &ldquo;it cost 84000 dollars to make that, atually just to pay the students for that day cause we took an entire day with them and they each had to be paid 84 dollars so times a thousand, and we had to have only modern students who were also drivers,&rdquo; and he went into the details a bit and then someone called and apparently said, &ldquo;yo trent this is Chuck we are at the airport now&rdquo; and he said to them, &ldquo;okay call me when you get here&rdquo; and hung up, but then to me, &ldquo;I have no idea who Chuck is; I doubt they know how to get here. I don&rsquo;t have time to answer to everyone&rsquo;s whim like I wish people knew I didn&rsquo;t.</em></p>

<p>_before that I had been hanging out with Fred, including at a hotel, overlooking a city where we had been playing for a while.  The night sky was crystal clear and he was showing me something about the cars on the street way down below us. He had some puzzles out on the table and I remember having played with them for a while before he had to put them away, but before he put them away, we were talking about this or that _</p>

<p>At the very end of the dream, I noted a tiny distinction between I&rsquo;m asleep and I&rsquo;m awake. or I noticed that the distinction was tiny. Why is that? What is that? I wonder how long I can ease around that distinction, experiencing it, and can I flip back from dream reality to awake reality to deam reality with ease? I should be able to, but how do I learn how to do it?</p>

<p>I just wrote this to my friend Laura</p>

<p>Hi Laura!!</p>

<p>You were in my dream last night!  We were at a party; I think it was my birthday.  Thanks for coming!!  You were standing a bit away from the party fracas, so were the first person I saw when I came in.  I was so happy to see you!!  We kissed a little bit and then you were like, &ldquo;okay, that&rsquo;s enough, thunder buns&rdquo; and then I woke up.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve started doing morning meditations and writing again for my soul connectivity.  Lin and I are both working, she&rsquo;s working for a temp agency while looking for different full time work, including possibly overseas! I&rsquo;m working for a startup which has just recently hired another guy, so we are up to four people now.   We do websites and mobile app development.</p>

<p>On the side, I&rsquo;m doing iPhone app development with a guy; we have one app available in the US, and are working on another set of game apps now.</p>

<p>For a few days/weeks near the end of last year, I was doing a bit of genealogical research, just by interviewing a couple people in Lin&rsquo;s family who live here in Tokyo.   I put some of the data on <a href="https://familysearch.org/">https://familysearch.org/</a> and was excited to see new names connected to some names I knew from my old research with you.  I found an ancestral link that extended back back back to some kings and queens.  I was like whoohoo!  Show me the money!!!   and then back back back to Jesus and I was like, whoohoo wait he had siblings???? and then back back back to Adam and Eve, labeled First Man and First Woman, and I kinda lost my interest.</p>

<p>Up to what have you recently been?</p>

<p>xoxoxoxox
- Rob!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve nearly finished the basic memory game where people try to find pairs of cards on the screen.  I am able to turn all the cards over with the touch of a button, and can ensure pairs of cards are displayed on the screen, and detect matches and remove them from the table if they match.   This is thanks to Ray Wenderlich&rsquo;s Snap! example, on his site.  I am likely to make a couple of the components be open source; I need to add a timer, and I have an interesting (?) idea on how to make one that I hope will be cool.  If it seems to work well, I might even submit it to Cocoa Controls, though I&rsquo;m not sure how that process words.</p>

<p><em>Outside a large shopping mall, I was riding my bicycle searching for a specific store or searching for Fred to help him find the store or books that he wanted to find. I wanted to change some parts of the mall to make it easier for blind shoppers to navigate safely around; there were some unnecessary cubs and I considered ways to make them elsewhere so the traffic flow would be revitalized for the good of all the shoppers, bt then I noted that shopping is not for the good of the people but for the good of the economy which is for the good of the bankers and held back on doing any more shopping supportive activities</em></p>

<p>Today is a holiday so I don&rsquo;t have to go out into the snow.  yay!</p>

<p>Today is a holiday called Coming of Age Day, when <del>kids</del> adults(?) who will turn 20 this year all put on their finest kimono and attend an speech by the local leaders who say, &ldquo;okay you&rsquo;re adults now; you can smoke and drink&rdquo; and the kids at the back of the assembly get blasted on alcohol and make a big scene. (Anecdotal story from Lin)</p>

<p><em>In a large store room with lots of old articles and stuff, I was talking to a young woman who had lived and played there for some years / her whole life. I found that I could hang from the ceiling slats that were spaced enough apart to get my hands between, so I was walking myself from beam to beam, suspended by my fingers. I was surprised at how well I could do it, and she joined me, and kinda chased me around on the ceiling as we walked our hands around hanging from the ceiling. I thought it would be fun to play hide and seek, so I went over to where she was and found she was just at that moment, already hiding, so she squirmed her way out of the very tight spot into which she had wriggled herself, and I was like ormg how can she do that? cause it was so tight; with floor boards scraping along all sides of her body like straw as she came out, lifting the floor with her torso. I was like, &ldquo;I just considered playing hide and seek with you; do you want to look first or hide first?&rdquo; and she said &ldquo;hide first,&rdquo; I go, &ldquo;okay, so I&rsquo;ll give you five minutes,&rdquo; and she looked like that wasn&rsquo;t long enough, &ldquo;okay six minutes and then I&rsquo;ll come find you.&rdquo; and I thought &ldquo;Oh what are the boundaries of the hiding area?&rdquo; and as she was explaining, a guy came up behind her, but from outside the building, as he could see through the slats. She turned around as I said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a guy behind you&rdquo; in Japanese and she was like &ldquo;oh hey it&rsquo;s you&rdquo; and gave him a bit of a polite kiss through the slats. I introduced myself and then he gave us the news</em></p>

<p><em>grandpa had died so we were all preparing for the funeral. I went to the place that helps prepare the money donations and they were making a lot of money after he died. I paid them 10,000 yen and they gave me a wad of money , including 1000 yen notes, 5000 yen notes and 10,000 yen notes, and checks, one of which was from Robin Sykes. They gave the money to me in a crumpled wad and I held it in my hands with my crying eyes closed, saying a blessing for grandpa and placing it in a white decorative paper with the shape of a crane on top, woven out of bamboo. I put that in my pocket and carried it around, including back to the house. I didn&rsquo;t know the correct way to hold the paper so I asked someone at one point. They confirmed my suggestion of straight up. During the night, the money seems to keep falling out, and then I found it again remembering I had never taken it out of my pocket, or noticing that the wad was still in my pocket, but the decorative thing was in my hand.</em></p>

<p><em>I had previously been in the house with Ma and Fred and Lin, sitting on the toilet in the bathroom, which had no walls. I noticed that the mirror on the sideways ceiling had a reflection of the stairwell below it (reflected in it), and a mockup of the stairwell around it, so only from that point on the toilet could we see the mockup surrounding a reflection of the actual thing which was the actual thing as much as possible. I wondered why I hadn&rsquo;t seen it before, but there it was plain as day. I took the time to write and we went out to the cars to prepare for the wedding, and Uncle Herb was behind me, being straight mean to me, accusing me of not correctly holding my money thing or wearing the right clothes, so I was trying to ignore him politely, and then I dropped the money wad I had or actually just the white paper surrounding it and he was like, &ldquo;do you want me the fucking punch you in the nose? I should do it and I&rsquo;d break you, knock you right up into the air and back down and everyone would see it on camera.&rdquo; I was like, &ldquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t do that&rdquo; and he was like, &ldquo;it would be hilarious to everyone,&rdquo; and I go, &ldquo;well everyone but me&rdquo; and he said &ldquo;well with time, you&rsquo;d see how funny it was too watching it again on video.&rdquo; The line was released and we started to walk to vehicles to go. I asked Ma if we should go in one car, and she said, &ldquo;no we should probably separate and meet new people,&rdquo; so I went to a minivan with some girls beaconing me inside. They were doing the &ldquo;sit here&rdquo; thing, but with their fingers already up, and I sat right on their hands and joked, &ldquo;oh I wonder what that is&rdquo; and they giggled and knew I might be fun. We did introductions and they were telling me they were from PCB, and I was like, &ldquo;PCB PCB Pacific Country Board?&rdquo; and they were like, no it&rsquo;s a school in Seattle&rdquo; and I had a hint of a memory from my genealogical research about it. The car started moving and we were going over some train tracks, or going along the train tracks and I could see tremendous gaps in the tracks, but we went smoothly over them; I surmised that the other wheels were keeping us going smoothly; we didn&rsquo;t even feel a bump. Looking down, I could see into the construction they were doing on the underground track, and it was all full of water so really surprising to me, but more surprising was something was moving, something mechanical was being pulled through the water; it looked like a lot of frames tied together and being pulled, but not a train, just like frames of small boxes all tied together and the boxes were mostly submerged int he yellow-muddy water but the train of boxes had a chain submerged keeping them all together.</em></p>

<p><em>The minivan had a privacy screen that the girls and guys in the back (there were about 10 people) raised so we would have some privacy, and they all began taking off their clothes and I was like when in Rome and joined them; the girls each were chewing on some guys ear or the guys were biting legs; I couldn&rsquo;t tell who was chewing or kissing whom, and it all seemed pretty enjoyable. We arrived at the place and needed to get our clothes back on. I went out at first and one of the guys was like, &ldquo;oh you might want to hook up with Julie; she&rsquo;s single.&rdquo; and I go, &ldquo;oh, thanks, but I&rdquo;m married&rdquo; and he looked a bit surprised, but I got, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s okay; we had already decided to meet knew people on the way her&rdquo; and left it at that. I went to look for my pants and found them, but then saw the belt was wrong. I found some others, and then noticed they were too big. Finally found my pants over where I had been sitting and put them on. I couldn&rsquo;t seem to get my shirt tucked into them properly; it kept coming out or going the wrong direction. Finally I seemed to get it tucked in okay.</em></p>

<p><em>I was washing off my glass in the sink, while talking to a guy who knew my brother lived in Boston, and was like &ldquo;so Fred&rsquo;s from Boston; that&rsquo;s cool&rdquo; and I go, &ldquo;oh he lived there, but we are from Houston; we used to hang out in the Woodlands, though&rdquo; and he was like, &ldquo;oh really that&rsquo;s cool; we live there now,&rdquo; We were talking about that a bit,</em> and I woke up.</p>

<p><em>With peeps from PB, walking along a seashore at the bottom of a relatively steep rocky face, not steep enough to be a cliff, but about 60 degree descent, but upon which were many people sitting enjoying the water, including families and dogs and kids, we were at the top , and I had been sweeping sweeping inside the house, debris had collected from the night before as the garage door was ajar (from the bottom) and pine needles had been blown in. I was sweeping them, enjoying the meditative experience of just sweeping and cleaning, and the debris got a bit bigger until I was sweeping pebbles and then I was on the beach, sweeping rocky pebbles and then proper rocks.</em></p>

<p><em>A friend was helping me clean up and went to pick up a styrofoam mountain as from an HO train set, but it was a real one used by the natives as a sacred site; I was like, &ldquo;are you sure you want to remove that? and he was like, &ldquo;nah&rdquo; and left it, but then I was like, &ldquo;well it&rsquo;s okay, and I swept it as Carissa was saying &ldquo;we have volcanoes in Sioux Hills,&rdquo; and I was like, &ldquo;really?&rdquo; and she goes, I told you last night! I was like, &ldquo;oh yeah, but then I was like, &ldquo;oh no you didn&rsquo;t you said you had them in Iowa, not in Sioux Hills,&rdquo; and she was like, &ldquo;I said 10, not nine,&rdquo; and I said, &ldquo;I said &lsquo;Iowa&rsquo;, not &lsquo;nine&rsquo;&rdquo; and she was like, &ldquo;I said, &lsquo;ten&rsquo;&rdquo; and I go, &ldquo;okay forget it&rdquo; as lava had started to trickle out of the hole beneath the space where the styrofoam mountain had been. I watched for a bit and the lava began to pour out in a thin stream, straight toward the rocky face upon which hundreds of people were relaxing facing the water.</em></p>

<p><em>I began to shout, &ldquo;lava!!!!&rdquo; as loudly as I&rsquo;d shout &ldquo;shark&rdquo; if there was one, as the lava was streaming its 1000 degree self straight down the mountain, right between lots of people, and kids were walking around clueless and then one stepped in it and was like &ldquo;kyaaaaah&rdquo; as it burned him and a guy touched it, all while I was shouting &ldquo;lava!!&rdquo; as loud as I could and then another, larger stream of lava started to come sideways along the beach but not pouring down until it got to my little stream, which was now a big stream, and the scene shifted to us all escaping the lava on a train, but it had lava trickling down the middle of it and as people were getting off the train, I was like, &ldquo;watch the lava, don&rsquo;t step in it, okay watch the lava..&rdquo; and people were cluelessly stepping in it and just over it without looking, and then I was like, &ldquo;HEY&rdquo; right in the face of a woman with kids, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s LAVA on the floor right here&rdquo; but as I was saying that, her kids didn&rsquo;t stop and were walking right over it, and I was like, &ldquo;sorry to yell&rdquo; but then I saw her kids and the next family not stopping and then walking over it, and in it, and I was like omg this is useless and started asking people to help me build a human wall to help keep people away from the lava as they just kept coming in without paying attention to anything and without a clue was to what was going on.</em></p>

<p>2:51am Thursday 10 January 2013 as I write this.  Just now about to go to bed after chatting with Lin a bit about the best way to get Ma and Fred to Shinagawa station.  She wanted to rent a car to Shinagawa, but I think a simple taxi ride one way to Kawasaki will be faster and cheaper overall.</p>

<p>Chatted with Fred at the monthly apartment while he packed.  When I Quit and Saved a Copy of the Minecraft Pocket Edition map from his phone to mine, the basement and one wall of our house was missing.   0.5.0 beta so I guess we came across a bonus bug.  We considered saving the files directly, but I was like, &ldquo;nah it ain&rsquo;t worth it.&rdquo;  You gotta pack and we gotta wake up and go to work/airport tomorrow.</p>

<p>I carried home the heater Paola and Jon gave to us.  It&rsquo;s a liquid-filled radiator, so pretty heavy.  I used the same plastic twine stuff: two lines each double looped around nice round parts of the heater and the longer one over my shoulder and the shorter one in my hand, both with padding from the toilet seat cover / lid cover that are coming home as well.</p>

<p>Paola and Jon had us all over for dinner today: lovely fresh salad, lovely yummy rice-shaped pasta with chicken, and incredible desserts from Taiwan.  Paola had just gotten back from doing a vipassana course in Taiwan, which featured some food shopping after the course.</p>

<p>Today at work I was doing tests after <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14211281/how-to-daemonize-a-php-script-to-be-run-with-upstart">daemonizing the mailer</a>; I want to make sure it doesn&rsquo;t send double emails if multiple scripts are running at the same time.   But it sent several duplicate emails, moe joe.</p>

<p>Oh, and I came across <a href="https://thinkup.com">thinkup</a> today.  I think I&rsquo;ll install it on my domain.</p>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://www.calendarlabs.com/">calendarlabs</a> for saving me several hours of work.  I printed 12 monthly calendars on A4 size pages including Japanese holidays.  Nice.</p>

<p>I found an slow, but easy way to close redmine tickets.   Today I asked about some that have been lingering from the beginning of the project, and Shirata-san said those features are no longer needed.  Nice(?)</p>
