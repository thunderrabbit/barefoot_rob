<p>They never found a CD player, but talked a bit more as I applied
pressure to knotted muscles on Corey's back and Erin's hand.</p>

<p>Maggie and Olivia said that we were cool; I informed them of the
rest of the cool youth in the district and encouraged them to get
involved with SWD events or the other districts nearby Memphis.</p>

<p>Olivia is asleep; Maggie is reading <em>The Great Gatsby</em>;
about 70% of the way through.  They are out in the hall.  Everyone
else who played SF is in the high school room zonked out, including
Erin underneath the back table.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>

<p class=date>8:32 am Sunday</p>

<p>"Bring Out Your Dead!"  [BONG!] "Bring Out Your Dead!"</p>

<p>It would be a funny way to wake up people at the next rally: Get AJ
and Noah to drag sleeping bags of people into a pile.</p>

<p>Chillin at the airport now.  I got through security in about 5
minutes, from electronic ticket check-in to walking past the security
gates.</p>

<p>No assault rifles in sight; I think I heard something about that
being the case soon.</p>

<p>Super thanks to Maggie for taking me!  I drove to her house where I
left Scott, and I'll take him home on Sunday after chillin' at Molly's
house for Will's party.</p>

<p>Will doesn't read my journal, does he Molly?</p>

<p>Oh my gosh you know what's funny?  I was concerned about him
reading that, but this won't even be posted until after I get back;
probably post it on Monday.</p>

<p>I'm going to read more of the Youth Advisor Task Force report.</p>

<p class=date>9:30 am</p>

<p>I have been sitting here for however long I've been here, and I
just noticed that no one has been talking to their seat-neighbors, but
most people have been talking on cell phones to friends/family.  Does
wireless communication keep people from meeting strangers?  Hmmmm.</p>

<p>Okay, of course it's not a black and white issue, but how does it
affect interactions of proximity relationships vs other relationships?
Hmmmmmmm.</p>

<p class=date>2:53 pm Friday 5 May 2002</p>

<p>Chillin' with Mr The Bibbster in Memphis now.  I took so many pictures on
the plane on the way here!  Steve and Lisa were not on my flight, so when I
arrived, I just wandered through the airport a bit until I found Debu.  Sat
with her after briefly looking for Sean.  Then got a phone call.  It was
Steve, with Sean and Lisa and Brenda.</p>

<p>I'm at the board meeting now.  I'll stay until I become bored.
Woah.  Big train rumbling slowly by outside.  Huge bridge.  I just
took a picture.</p>

<p>Steve is explaining the budget, and basically just describing the
reasons for any anomalies that seem apparent.  Steve is an excellent
treasurer</p>

<p class=date>3:20 pm</p>

<p>Bob Hill just mentioned my mom's name because she is retiring from
ministering at her church.</p>

<p class=date>4:21 pm</p>

<p>After a brief nap, I just got to introduce myself as part of the
CYA.  I told them I'm the Older Wiser Son of my mom.  That got a good
laugh, so I mentioned that Fred introduces himself as New Improved
Son...</p>

<p class=date>5:50 pm</p>

<p>Board meeting is over.  I made it through the whole thing,
including 1 nap.  I wrote a test email via my Visor to see if I can
get it to work the way I would like.  Last time I tried to mess with
it, it took too long to synch.</p>

<p>Sean and I trekked down by the river, through all the briars and
brambles.  Lots of stickers and it got dark.  But we wizzed and tried to
dislodge a big pile of sticks and stuff into the river.  They were chillin'
in a 'stagnant' part of the river.  We couldn't readily see why that part of
the river wasn't flowing.</p>

<p>It got pretty dark, so we headed back, four wheel driving up the hill
(two hands two feet each)</p>

<p>After we got inside, the amazing experience is that our hands felt like
hot water was being poured over them.  so freaky and cool enough to make it
worth the stickers, even if there hadn't been a huge river to watch.</p>

<p>Theme speaker was cool; he told a couple stories suggesting that the
journey of finding ones true self is actually the length of an inch, for
that which we are searching is with us all the time.</p>

<p>We played two games of Captain Video, but got interrupted just as I was
going to  show Erin's video to Sarah.</p>

<p class=grafitti>this is rob's daily silly notes and he never says what he
really meains, ony what steve really means</p>

<p class=date>10:15 pm</p>

<p>We are playing Mafia now.  Sean is God;  I was killed even though
innocent.</p>

<p class=date>12:01 am Saturday 6 April 2002</p>

<p>Good job to Erin for ordering pizza despite her fear of talking on the
phone.</p>

<p>I've been talking to Lisa, the junior high advisor person who reminds me
of Christina Branum-Martin.</p>

<p>Played two games of Silent Football.  Interesting the huge leaps of
SF-consciousness through which Curtis transformed.  From asking
millions of questions about stuff that everyone else understood, then
being all silly and trying to lose (he lost), then playing a perfect
game, where he got only like 1 penance point.  Quite impressive.</p>

<p>The most amazing thing was we added a wormhole to the universe
(between me and Richard) because they all were doing so perfectly
moving the football around.</p>

<p>Even with the wormhole, they did exceptionally well.  The coolest
part to me was that the wormhole just works; it makes sense the way it
works and I could explain it and people were all, "ah, that makes
sense."  To the point that someone shrugged and it went back through
the wormhole to the originator.... it's just cool the way it
works.</p>

<p>I mean, it's only a game, and it's just a bunch of arbitrary rules,
but the rules are internally consistent...  I guess that's it.  Like a
beautiful well rounded algebra, they just do the right thing.</p>

<p>Miss Corey lost the second game, and for penance we made her be at
the end of a back massage chain.  The group has just now become quiet
in the big room.  We have to be awake in about 4 hours I think.</p>

<p>I've just been talking to Lisa, who asked me about rallies and
such.  She's quite interested in helping get her youth to rallies.</p>

<p>I'm glad that I seem to know so much about them and that I'm here
to help teach.</p>

<p>Today is my Friday this week.  I'm off tomorrow to attend Committee
on Youth Advisors in Memphis.</p>

<p>I got in a bit of trouble today for too much IMing yesterday.
True, but it was also the case they saw me IMing every time I came in,
though I wasn't IMing all the time.  Oh well.</p>

<p>I'm thankful for Amy taking me to the airport tomorrow on such
short notice, and for Maggie picking me up on Sunday on not quite such
short notice.</p>

<p class=date>5:15pm</p>

<p>I'm leaving now to go to investment club meeting.  I'll probably
come back in to work tonight to get some shit done before I go for the
rest of the weekend.</p>

<p>Just heard from Amy that she has a work-related request that makes
it difficult for her to take me, but she'll still do it if I can't
find someone else.</p>

<p>Rolled over to University Schwinn last night to get
my spoke fixed, but Jeff said he was too busy, and it
would be okay to continue rolling around for a while
with it broken.  'I've got <em>two</em> spokes broken
on my bike,' he said, like it was a contest.</p>

<p>Painted three flags on a soap dish at Paint This!,
which is just two shops down from the bike place,
which is how I started going to that bike shop
originally.</p>

<p>They look pretty good for the size brush I used...
I felt rushed to get them done quickly; I wonder if
I'll be happier with myself  just getting it done, or
doing a nicer job.</p>

<p>There's all sorts of questions in my head about
this - I don't know how long each of them will be
there (that's how I chose the flags - 3 countries are
represented by the pees who live there), making the
gift time-sensitive, in a way.</p>

<p>And it's a soap dish for goodness sakes.  It will
get soap scum on it, blocking the image anyway.</p>

<p>I'm not going to repaint it.</p>

<p>Bicycle home, the drove to the Galleria to purchase
Texas longhorn postcards (not the school, but the
animal) to send to my new overseas friends, and to
Gabriella, my work-related contact in Switzerland.</p>

<p>I'm not going to bed yet, but this is the last entry I'll likely
write before my trip to Memphis tomorrow.</p>

<p>Funny:  Sean (actually his dad Rick) asked if anyone would be at
the airport around 12:10pm.  I replied that I'd be there by 12:18pm,
but didn't know if Sean would want to hang around that long.</p>

<p>I'm at work now, hanging out a bit while our friends at Singapore
are awake, but they didn't email me back so oh well.  While waiting, I
updated a few old journal entries.</p>

<p>Now I'm going to go eat a snack or something with Lee-eh.</p>

<p class=date>12:54 am</p>

<p>Lee-eh just asked, "can I keep [this]?" pointing to the menu as the
waitress was leaving our table at House of Pies.  She was all, "yes,"
then as she walked away, "until you leave."</p>

<p>Funny.</p>

<p>After work, which was some good some bad, Eric
helped me do a futon switcharoo.  He and Meredith
bought a new home and wanted their futon back, which I
had been using for a couple months now.</p>

<p>Before he got to my house, he called and prompted
me with, "I'm in Meredith's Explorer, so she has a
great sound system, but bad music, so bring some CDs
that we can rock out to."  Awesome!</p>

<p>Prince, Life is Meat, BAD, Schoolhouse Rocks, 20
Best Boomin' Bass Hits, Public Image Limited, Whodini,
Young MC, and others</p>

<p>Dropped off a couch at his storage shed, picked up
my dad's futon from his storage shed, brought dad's
futon to my apartment (stopped in Tomball at Wendy's
for food and I went in barefoot, but they didn't
notice, ha ha), took Eric's futon out of my
apartment.</p>

<p>Eric said he could get his futon into his storage
shed without a problem (it's significantly lighter
than my dad's), so I stayed at home, called Gene the
cooking-and-bike-maintenance machine to look over my
bike after my accident on Monday.</p>

<p>Put the futon together while waiting for Gene, who
was slightly delayed; he got to my apartment about
11pm.</p>

<p>Beautiful cleaning and re-lube job, and he found a
broken spoke on my back wheel.  I'll get it fixed
tonight.  I'm very thankful that I asked Gene to look
at the bike.  I wouldn't have inspected it, and
woldn't have found the broken spoke...</p>

<p>Thankful for Eric and Gene in my life. :-)</p>

Subject: Time Travelers PLEASE HELP!!!

If you are a time traveler or alien disguised as human and or have
the technology to travel physically through time I need your help!

My life has been severely tampered with and cursed!!
I have suffered tremendously and am now dying!

I need to be able to:

Travel back in time.

Rewind my life including my age back to 4.

I am in very great danger and need this immediately!

I am aware of two types of time travel one in physical form and 
the other
in energy form where a snapshot of your brain is taken using 
either the
dimensional warp or the carbon copy replica device and then sends 
your consciousness
back through time to part with your younger self. Please explain
how safe and what your method involves.

I have a time machine now, but it has limited abilitys and is 
useless
without
a vortex.

If you can provide information on how to create vortex generator 
or
where I can get some of the blue glowing moon crystals this would 
also
be helpful. I am however concerned with the high level of 
radiation these
crystals give off, if  you could provide a shielding that would be 
great.
I believe the vortex needs to be east-west polarized,
North-south polarized vortexexs are used for cross-dimensional 
time 
travel only.


Only if you have this technology and can help me exactly as 
mentioned
please send me a (SEPARATE) email to: IneedTimeTravel@aol.com

Please do not reply if your an evil alien!
Thanks
