<p>I forgot how to use a fork.  Tonight while eating dinner with Shin,
I forked my front tooth really hard like "conk!" and I was like "oh
shit" cause it felt really wierd and I was worried I might have
chipped it.  But I didn't.  Shin asked the waitress for chopsticks.
This is an unexpected anti-culture shock!  How will I eat in the
US?</p>

<p>Shin helped me apply to stay with a host family, but we got stuck
when I said I wanted to stay for 5 months (mid-October to March).</p>

<p>Or maybe it was that I said I'm a Nova instructor.  Those dumb Nova
instructors, always messing it up for the rest of us.</p>

<p>Anyway, whereas, per my understanding via Shin, previously, they
were like, "yeah you can kickit for 3 months with one fam and then 3
months with another fam," soon as I wanted 2 months and 3 months, I
was encouraged to do a homevisit, where I meet with the peeps one day
or one night.</p>

<p>Seems that some people had used the families just as cheap housing
and didn't really chat with them / share ideas, whatever.  So a
homevisit is just yammering for a day.  Less time spent overall, but
likely more chatter time.  But I wonder if the chatter would be
helpful toward learning Japanese.</p>

<p>Hmmm.  So another option is to just meet some of the cats in my
apartment slash apply for homevisits in my area and see what happens.
Hmmm.</p>

<p>Spent some hours today messing with my 1998 journal, copying many
entries from my old static index directory so they can be used by the
new .pl format.  I haven't finished actually editing the files to
remove references to the static index, nor have I corrected some
references to images in that directory.</p>

<p>When I got to a stopping point, I looked up from my computer and
was surprised to find myself in Japan.  <em>oh yeah.  Japan.</em></p>

<p>I rode my bike to Kikuna station (SO EXCITED THAT JANETTE IS
BRINGING MY *REAL* BIKE WHEN SHE COMES!!!) to meet Shin.</p>

<p>(I think I should have janette bring my helmet as well.  Just...
because.)</p>

<p class=date>11:12pm</p>

<p>Lesson with Shin was cool; he expressed some concern about getting
a job in the US..  I thought he was going for his job.  Hmm.</p>

<p>We ate at Jonathan's, the upscale chain place where we went for our
first lesson in Kikuna.  He asked, "do you think I can meet with you
in the US?"  I was like, "um, the US is really big..."</p>

<p>Slept the hell out of this morning.  Until like 1:40pm.</p>

<p>Fixed the <a href="/travel/costa_rica/1998/">Costa Rica pics</a>
thanks to janette and indirectly Scout Seven.</p>

<p>Now I'm considering reorganizing navigation of my site.  I'll
design it on paper first.</p>

<p class=date>12:07am JST Wednesday 30 July 2003</p>

<p>Well.</p>

<p>I realized I've got a few more ideas in my head than I can program
<em>well</em> on my site.  I need to yammer with a regular expression
person (read Fred) before I implement it.</p>

<p>I *did*, however, tweak my old journal script for Jon, who, for
some reason doesn't like the new journal.pl  Ah well; I felt pretty
smart after figuring that out.  Though it took a bit longer to figure
out than it should have.  Whatever that means.</p>

<p>Talked to Olivia; she came down to check her email and we yammered
a bit.</p>

<p>This is my 123rd day in Japan.</p>

<p>When I realized that I *almost* started working on my days in Japan
counter, but realized that would be a tangent and would not make me
really happy today cause studying nihongo would put me closer to my
goal in Japan, so I just wrote this entry to say good job me for
pulling myself back on course.  Now let's see if I can handle the
other obstacles I seem to throw in my own path.</p>

<p>To Do:</p>

<p>*) write some vocab on my flashcards</p>

<p>#) go to Kawaski, studying that vocab on the train</p>

<p>!) get food and eat and write Japanese sentences</p>

<p>$) show the sentences to Japanese staff for correction and cheerleading</p>

<p>%) good job, Rob</p>

<p class=dream>I had a dream this morning about kissing a woman.  I
didn't know her; just some random hottie on the street and I realized
it was a dream so I pulled her on top of me and we just started
smooching.  I was practically animal gross slobbery kissing her at
first and then I realized that wasn't too sensual, so I slowed it down
a bit and after that we stopped and just sat on the steps wondering
what to do next.</p>

<p>i dunno, what do <em>you</em> want to do?</p>

<p>I gave Naomi my number today.  She's the crazy genki student who
cracked me up so much last time: "you're *hilarious*" I told her then
and again today.  The one who operates the elevator in Tokyo Tower.
The one who mimicked an elephant last time we chatted.  She reminds me
of Sally in her genkiness.</p>

<p>Okay.  No more giving my number out to students.</p>

<p>I broke up with Sumika tonight.  She's the staff person at KQ whose
got lovely long hair and has been really pretty nice to me though
other people have said she's mean to them.  (mean?)  I broke up with
her after some flirtation got like zero response.  She's obviously not
impressed with such, so.. no more effort will be expended in that
direction.</p>

<p>For the record, the flirtation happened after Benny was all,
"Sumika, what does your name mean?"  And she told him/us, and I said,
"it means beautiful flower," and she's like "no it doesn't."</p>

<p>Okay.  Whatever.  You're fired.</p>
