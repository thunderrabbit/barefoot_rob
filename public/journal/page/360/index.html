<p>Boo for strict Japanese culture!  I cannot easily get time off
until 28 September, which will be the first day of my second six
months here.  Starting then it will be "no problem" to get time off.
I'll talk to janette tonight about how that affects plans and such.  I
called Josephine around 1pm my time = 11pm last night her time.
janette was snoozin' and I didn't want to wake her up with 'bad' news.
Plus I only had 2 minutes left on the phone card.</p>

<p>Some people here spend all their money on alcohol.  I spend mine on
chocolate, internet, and long distance calls.</p>

<p>Man, stupid Mac iPhoto is dumb.  I'm only using it cause it's fast,
but it's wack the way it put together this photo album for Hakone.
It's like as good as a beta version of the software, with inconsistent
links and crap like that.</p>

<p>Anyway, if I remember, there will be images of hakone on my site by
the time this entry is up.  Click on japan above and look for hakone
pics.</p>

<p><p><b>Subject:</b> fish on forest fire sign</p>

<p><p><b>Comment:</b>
<br>Hi Rob,<br>
<br>
Maybe the fish jumping out of the water was on the forest fire prevention sign because when fires occur, erosion increases. Sediment load into water bodies increases and blocks out sunlight which some aquatic organisms like algae rely on for survival. Basically, fish die when the food chain gets screwed up. - Last Sunday in San Diego I saw an Imax about coral reefs and this happened off the coast of fiji or someplace. The coral reefs and fish that relied on the reefs went away or died because of increased sediment load due to forest fires.<br>
<br>
What do you think of this theory?<br>
<br>

<p>My throat is a tidbit sore.  I felt it starting after I ate curry
rice with Kimberly and Landen.  The rice was kinda spicy; I didn't
know if maybe that had caused it.  Due to my innate ability to not get
sick, I don't know what to do if I do get sick, including now.  I've
slept most of today after studying with Koko, and I've been drinking
lots of water.  Maybe a hot cup of tea will do well for me.  I've
chowed some of the food I bought yesterday evening with Matty.</p>

<p>Part of me wants to just lose myself online, part of me just wants
to eat, part of me just wants to sleep.  I think it's good to not have
internet access in the apartment, or I wouldn't study as much
Japanese.</p>

<p>Met Kimberly at class today.  I noticed her when she first came
into the building, like "whoah, cute blonde alert" and wondered about
meeting her, etc.   She joined the table next to ours, the "smarter"
table and I was like damn and she's smart too.  But then during the
break she was downgraded to our table, and I had to work to get past
her looks and maintain normal behavior as in not be snooty assuming
she was too-pretty-and-knew-it, nor be all, "hey baby what's your
name?" but instead just go with it and let us all introduce ourselves
when the next part of the lesson began.</p>

<p>She's Kimberly from Georgia, and her Georgia peach accent appears
when she talks about home.  Her last name is distinctly not American;
she's married to a Japanese cat.  After class, I was targeting her a
bit to see just what is the dealio and there was some kid in a
stroller being brought into the room.</p>

<p>Her baby.</p>

<p>Whew.  Okay.  Full stop; crisis averted.  No kids allowed flag has
been thrown.   No worries at all.</p>

<p>I walked her to the train station and learned about the fam
situation; it seems she is becoming the classic Japanese housewife.  I
project that she is bored at home, just taking care of Landen.  Her
husband works for Panasonic.  I imagine he's a fledgling salaryman.  I
dunno.</p>

<p>Dropped her off at Kikuna.  Rode my bike to Tsunashima.   Talked on
the phone with janette to tell her about the averted crisis.  I really
love janette for understanding such crises and helping me get past
them.  Got to Tsunashima and bang, Kimberly is there, having just
gotten out of the station with the big L.</p>

<p>I knew she lives near Tsunashima, so I thought it was a bit weird
that she would go to Kikuna to walk back toward the lounge, but hey
whatever.  I hung up with janette.  "That was my girlfriend" to
Kimberly to clearly state boundaries.  Didn't drop all plans to hang
with K, but went to get my hair cut, then met her back at the station
and we munched at a curry rice place.</p>

<p>She's lived in Tsunashima since November, so knows the area more.
Plus she doesn't have a job so she gets to fuck around more (maybe!!)
in the city.</p>

<p>Walked her part way home, called janette again on my way home.
Talked for 1.5 hours.  :-)</p>

<p>Took a big ol' fat nap with my short hair and then studies katakana
for an hour.  I now know ÉA - Ém.</p>

<p>They didn't cut my hair with no guard, so I'm going to go shave the
shit off in the shower now.   Not going to fucking waste 950
yen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and not have short-ass hair.  Damn that
was expensive.</p>

<p>Wow!</p>

<p>Today during work; actually it was before work, but I was in the
building, I went to pee and suddenly I felt a tidbit dizzy and then
realized "whoah!" it was an earthquake!</p>

<p>I enjoyed this earthquake cause I was on a "stable" surface (the
floor of the building) and could clearly feel the slow shaking motion
maybe a couple inches of displacement on the fourth floor every second
or so.</p>

<p>I ran to the window, looking for other signs.  A large wire between
telephone poles was oscillating.  Felt another shakey shake and could
see it begin oscillating again.</p>

<p>Looked at a tall building some hundreds of yards away, but couldn't
discern any oscillation in the building itself...  but(!) I could see
on top of the building the boom of a crane was shaking.</p>

<p>That seemed to be it, so I went into the office all, "wow!  that
was awesome!"</p>

<p>Some people were scared, or think I don't have a sense of what the
damage could really be like.  "6000 people dead in blahblahblah" some
city and I'm like, "so?  How many people live there?  Six
million?"</p>

<p>Later, Eric/k said it was a magnitude 6 in some city and 7 in some
other city.  That it caused the bullet train to stop, and caused some
fires elsewhere.</p>

<p>One man in the voice room predicted a big earthquake within two
weeks.</p>

<p>I was all, "alright!" but not everyone shared my enthusiasm.  I
just know that I'll be okay; if a big earthquake is an experience I
get to have, then I'm ready.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>On the train now to go home and life is normal.  Train is full.
People are talking or reading as they always do on the way home.</p>

<p>Stop fuckin' around and study.</p>

<p>Wait.</p>

<p>I got a box of COOKIES from janette and CDs from g!!  The CDs are
of Futurama episodes and I'm sure I'll love them.  For some reason,
though, my CD/DVD player ate the CD and won't give it back.  I'm quite
certain it's not the fault of the CD, but that the CD player is
damaged since I banged my computer pretty effectively one day and the
CD player started grinding and farting and stuff.  Now it won't play
the CD.  Ah well.  I wonder if I can fix it or if I should take it to
some Mac place in Japan.</p>

<p>The cookies are chocolate chip and chocolate chocolate chip and
they're the best cookies <em>ever</em>!!</p>

  no, not because you&rsquo;re blue.<br>

<p>Today I had FUT 2 (Follow Up Training 2) at Yokohama.  It wasn't as
bad as FUT 1 in terms of filling my brain to overflowing, but it was
certainly not my favorite thing in the world.</p>

<p>BUT, it means I can give level ups to students (recommend they move
from a level to the next level).  It takes two teachers to suggest a
student level up, plus the student passing a test (tailored for that
level) to move them to the next level.</p>

<p>Today as I went through my files, I saw that Rachel had given a LU
1 recommendation to a student and I ignored it, thinking I would not
let that sway my decision.</p>

<p>Later, when I had the class, I was like, "wow she was good" and it
turned out to be the student Rachel had recommended as well.  SO, I
got to give her the second LU!  But the student had split before I
completed her file in the teachers' room, so I didn't actually get to
give it to her.  Plus the original recommendation was a month and 2
days old (limit is supposed to be one month), but she hadn't been here
in a month and 2 days, so Steve was all, "can she move to the next
level?"  "yes" "then level her up."</p>

<p>That made today's training worth it.</p>

<p>Such a good feeling that I almost think I'll begin to memorize the
criteria for leveling up students to different levels.  Maybe I'll
start with the low levels and learn the criteria one level at a
time.</p>

<p>That makes sense.</p>

<p>Sigh.</p>

<p>I missed OKC Rally.  OKC is my favorite rally besides Houston.
And Houston is my favorite only because Jason and I planned it for
some years in a row and made it kick major ass.</p>

<p>OKC is my favorite rally because of fantastic memories of OKC 1987
and the church is a coooool shape for Sardines and awesome Silent
Football memories and because I learned the secret to Ceiling Wall
Floor at OKC.</p>

<p>I hope you cats had major fun.</p>

<p>You're still in my dreams at night.</p>

<p>I'm not going to attend SWUUSI.  I'm not even going to try, though
last year I said I would ask for the time off.  I don't want to go
through the pain of saying Goodbye again....  This seems to be what
Bryn described to me at San Antonio Rally a couple years ago.  I
wonder if it's subconsciously a reason I'm not getting too close to
people here in Japan.</p>

<p>Shit I gotta go to bed.  I have Japanese class in 9.5 hours.</p>

<p>In two days I will have been here two months.</p>

<p>Only four months until janette comes.  Only six months till my mom
and Jon come.</p>

<p>Only ten months until I can go anywhere I want.</p>

<p>I am consciously throwing away some Nova stuff, like evaluations of
how well people thought I taught various lessons.  I don't
particularly *want* to teach the perfect Nova lesson, though I
endeavor to use the parts of Nova lessons that I find valuable.  I'm
also throwing away stuff like the welcome to Nova BS that I got when I
first applied and was accepted.</p>

<p>I'm keeping some of the stuff I think I'll still refer to (map of
Japan), and archiving some things that were specific or influential
for me.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>The real reason I'm throwing away the evaluations is that they're
too painful for me to read.  Like I'm working my hardest to do a
perfect job, knowing that I'm being watched, but my best isn't
perfect.</p>

<p>Fuck that.  I'm throwing them away.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Haha. As I'm clearing out stuff, I found a note I had written in a
lesson.   Students were playing a game of describing something and
having the other's guess what they described.</p>

<pre>
"This rabbit has big ears."

"Mickey Mouse!"

(laughter)

<p class=date>10:53pm</p>

<p>Aight.  I've not gotten my room clean, and in fact it might look
worse now than it did a couple hours ago, *but* I have created a few
pages for my scrapbook, more like a paper archive than fun pictures
and such, and I have thrown some stuff in an envelope for janette.
And one for Fred.</p>

<p>I'm going to get some foooood.</p>

<p class=date>12:01am JST Monday 26 May 2003</p>

<p>Ate my favorite Korean food and some chocolate and about 500 ml of
orange juice.  Actually probably 600 ml.  Did one measurable thing for
the good of the apartment: I cleaned the kitchen trash can and took
out the trash.</p>

<p>Matty just came home a moment ago.  He's wayyyy drunk.  If I am
interpreting this noise correctly, he is hiccupping repeatedly in his
room.</p>

<p class=date>1:22am</p>

<p>Desk is better.  Bed is a mess.  Frank is home playing video games
to keep his mind off his upcoming trip home where his cousin ODed on
heroin or some shit like that.</p>

<p class=date>2:28am</p>

<p>Desk is a bit of a mess.  Bed is fixed.  I'm going to it.</p>
