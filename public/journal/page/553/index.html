<p>I got my windshield fixed on Scott today.  It's
been 2.5 or 3.5 weeks since it got <em>TOK</em>ked by
the rock or something on I-45.  The crack grew to
about 5 inches that day and has grown another 2 inches
since then.</p>

<p>For $45, a guy named Marshall fixed it.  He drilled
a hole at the end of the crack, a hole at the original
chip, and a hole along the length of the crack. 
Inserted resin into the thing and then sealed it with
UV radiation and gave me a lifetime guarantee on it. 
Nice.</p>

<p>He works behind Dr Gleem, a car wash place on Ella
Blvd, just north of 610 (north loop).  If you have any
windshield cracks, email me and see if mine has gotten
any worse.  <a

<p>Ack.  I'm trying to get some cool ass stuff done at
work, and I keep getting thrown all these bullshit
little jobs that I've figured out before and then they
get erased or lost and I have to figure them out
again.</p>

<p>In this case I'm talking about setting up a machine
to automatically receive emails to a certain address,
strip off the attachment if one exists, reply to the
user "we got yer attachment" email, and reply "try
again, dumbhead" if there was no attachment.</p>

<p>I set it up once about a year ago and then the
machine got reformatted, effectively erasing my work. 
Then I set it up again about 6 months ago and the same
thing happened.  NOW I'm putting it on a machine and
the same thing will happen again because this machine
is slated to be part of our web-server farm, and we
don't have a machine allocated just for this email
stripping service. Gack.</p>

<p class=date>9:41pm CDT Wednesday 11 April 2001</p></p>

<p>HI</p>

<p>Through no fault of your own, I haven't written a few significant
events lately.  Before I summarize them (nothing <em>that</em>
amazing), I'll describe my most recent possible volunteer thing.</p>

<p>I attended the board meeting of <a
href="https://home.flash.net/~bchostel/Budget_Traveling_and_Hostels.htm">Bluebonnet
Council of Hostelling International</a>, which I learned about when I
called them a few weeks ago after returning from Australia and talking
to Bryn.</p>

<p>Super informal meeting; they didn't even comment that I wore no
shoes.  David showed some slides from his bicycle tour through the
Alps (I think), and then they talked about plans for the next few
meetings.</p>

<p>Attendance has been low to the meetings; I will help with
advertising.  Because they are free, I can likely get a PSA announced
on KTRU.</p>

<p>I will also put together a web site cost proposal so they can sell
Europe Rail Passes and other hostelling stuffs.</p>

<p>The next presentation is Monday April 16th at 7pm at REI on I-10.
That's when David will give the real slide show of his Europe bike
trek, so you can come check it out!  I don't know the address of REI,
but it's the big outdoor equipment store on I-10 near Antoine
maybe.</p>

<p>Then there will be a presentation on Saturday 21 April at like 10am
at 2656 South Loop West, Suite 510.  The building is behind Bennigan's
just West of Kirby.  This will be a presentation of how to travel
safely and inexpensively.  I will present some of this meeting - how
to acquire passports and visas and general safety stuff.</p>

<p>So come check out these events!</p>

<p class=date>9:56pm CDT Wednesday 11 April 2001</p></p>

<p>Work on Monday and Tuesday was pretty focused on getting the G3
changes in place for the Singapore survey and a survey based in
California I think.  The singapore survey needed to have all traces of
javascript removed from it.  That was more of a pain than I had
predicted, but I got it done in a day or so.</p>

<p>After Spanish class last night I went back in to work to get the
Singapore survey in place online before they really started their
business day on Wednesday.  (They are 12 hours ahead of us I think)</p>

<p>Today I got the California survey data imported and moved online.
They have made a request that the current survey can't handle, but the
Ritz survey can.  So I'm going to convert the functionality of the
Ritz survey into the G3 functionality (and call it the OG survey) and
then incorporate the survey part of it into the G3.  Then the G3
survey can be super incredibly fly.</p>

<p>Once the macro programs for G3 were in place, it took me about 2
hours to set up the data for each survey and have them go live.  So
instead of a 2 week setup time, it's 2 hours.  That is totally fucking
awesome!!</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p></p>

<p class=dream>Being led by Robin from our I-group on a tour type
thing through some underground caves linking between a forest and an
old old house.</p>

<p class=dream>We were walking through relative darkness in the
forest, and then up an incline that had some wooden slats on it to
make it shaped slightly like stairs.  The stairs became more and more
like wooden steps until we were inside a house, coming up through the
basement.  The house was deserted, and had white mold on the floor
which seemed to irritate my nose.</p>

<p class=dream>We got up to the second floor of the house and I was
suddenly *haunted*, scared by ghost-type entities that I could feel
but not see.  I intentionally did not wake up, but visualized a pure
and loving golden light overt he whole house, driving out the spooky
spirits.</p>

<p>(In retrospect, I think a more powerful cleansing would be to
actually use the golden light to bless the spirits themselves and
allow them to feel loved and let them choose to leave instead of
forcing them out. Back to the dream:)</p>

<p class=dream>We walked back downstairs and out the front door back
to the pickup truck.  One of our group had decided to just stay there
and drink and smoke; he's not someone that I recognize.  We drove back
to the lodge and I woke up.</p>

<p class=dream>Down in a valley, talking and then the train came by up
above.  We ran up the hill; I wanted to see what types of cars would
be on this type of train.</p>

<p class=dream>The first car was a bus (after the engine) a schoolbus
and there were a few kids on it.  I waved to them as we walked fast
long with the train.  We were just about able to keep up with the
train, but not quite.  There were also kids on the subsequent cars,
which were neither school buses nor normal train cars.</p>

<p class=dream>A couple of kids jumped onto the train, even right up
by the female engineer, wo said "I don't have any tickets [so you
might as well get down]." They didn't get in trouble, so I wanted to
jump on, but I didn't.  I thought about asking if we could jump on
anyway, but I didn't. Before I really had the chance, the train turned
sharply right and the kids who were hanging on, jumped off before it
turned.  They had obviously done this before.  Now they were perfectly
at their station.</p>

<p>Slaving away in piles and piles of code, I am removing all traces of
Javascript from the G3 survey for our scaredy-cat client.  It's all good
though: because the G3 is so awesome, I can set up two versions: one with
javascript abilities and one without, both that affect the same set of data.
Very sweet!</p>

<p>I also had a conference call with two guys from a different company, I
may call the company Real, who will be reselling the G3.  They were the ones
for whom I did the dog and pony show two fridays ago.  They banged around on
it last week, and had their feedback today.  Very minor changes and I should
be able to get them all done this week.  They said the G3 was
"fantastic."</p>

<p>Yay!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>I-group was absolutely magical tonight.  We all
went to my friend Kathy Fey's (massage therapist) and
she taught us some basics of massage.  Everyone was in
a silly nervous state as we arrived, but on the way
out, the energy had been transformed into a magical,
blessed, loving radiance.  So fabulous.</p>

<p>Thanks to the <a
href="https://www.compaq.com/rcfoc">RCFoC</a> for
finding this <a
href="https://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/01_12/b3724007.htm">article</a>
on robots!</p>

<p>My imagination is piqued; I can hardly conceive of
all the cool-ass shit we will have in 5 to 10 years. 
Wende has already expressed fear, etc about having
nanobots; I wonder how she will react to having 1
meter tall robots walking around?</p>

<p>What happens when a vaguely-intelligent robot gets
lost?  It doesn't know where it lives, but some other
human finds it.  Just like a stray cat, do we put up
signs? "FOUND: L-27 model robot.  light green and
gray, scratch on left front arm.  email
ed@aodfldld.com"</p>

<p>What if a human programs a robot to appear lost,
but is actually a spy robot, programmed to read bank
account information and then infrared-beam it out the
house window to the attacker's listening device?</p>

<p>The "lost" robot would never have to be returned to
the malicious human; the information could still be
ferried out of the house.</p>

<p>Just wondering....</p>

<p class=dream>Dave (from work) and I were in my car and saw Channing
outside.  We asked him to bring his clown stuff to the rally, so he
put on a little show for us.  He had a small case out of which he
pulled a long (extendible) walking staff.  He was wearing some kind of
extensions on his legs, and he said something funny about being tall
and he legs shrank and then went tall again.  He got on his tall
bicycle and was riding around a bit and then he was walking and his
boots fell off, revealing the mechanism behind his leg extenders.  He
started to slip around and joked, "don't wear bathroom slippers while
doing this!"</p>

<p class=dream>As we were driving away, we were all, "thanks for the
show, Channing."  But he didn't respond; he was sitting back against
the wall in great pain; he had broken his ankle and his wrist somehow.
I wasn't sure where a hospital was because we were in Salt Lake
City. We started to get him in my car to drive him to the hospital
when I woke up.</p>
