<p>Yesterday, someone was like, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give anyone 500 bits to make some
more givaways&rdquo; so I made a thread on /u/BitTippers encouraging people
to meditate.</p>

<p>Decided to make it a daily thing.  I wonder how long it will last!</p>

<p>##21:45</p>

<p>Nice, I just got a tip for 500 bits; that should pay for a few more
days at least!</p>

<p>Shibata was hammering a chisel on something when I went in to the toy
store today.  She said she was &ldquo;making sand&rdquo;, which I couldn&rsquo;t really
disagree!  She was chipping sand from a block of fake sandstone, which
they had apparently made by mixing sand with some kind of glue.</p>

<p>I doubt it was made by Mother Nature because the sandstone had a
plastic model of a dinosaur in it.</p>

<p>I was like, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; and she goes &ldquo;stegasaurus&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah.  same.  What is dinosaur in general?&rdquo;</p>

<p>恐竜 (きょうりゅう), &ldquo;scary dragon&rdquo;</p>

<p>ふつの竜がこわくないですか？　&rdquo;Aren&rsquo;t regular dragons scary?&rdquo;</p>

<p>ま、ね。。  &ldquo;well yeah, but&rdquo;</p>

<p>I love teaching at Toshiba because the topics are so sciencey and
interesting!  Today Tomomi met me in Kawasaki station and introduced
me to some new people at Toshiba.  I had gone in earlier, thinking I
would have lessons with the attendants, but they were all like, &ldquo;ummm
not today!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Good thing I called JB, who was like, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry.  Wait for Tomomi
and she&rsquo;ll get you sorted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While there, I watched one of the demonstrations with liquid
nitrogen.</p>

<p>Spoilers!:</p>

<p>They dip a flower then crush it, dip a rubber ball then drop (and
shatter) it, dip an inflated balloon to watch it shrink (and
reinflate), and dip an inflated clear plastic bag to watch it shrink
as liquid appears on the inside.</p>

<p>Sweet as.  I came to Wired Cafe in Atre and asked if they have an
electrical outlet.  Not only do they, but to use it I get to sit in a
glass-wall corner overlooking Azalea and the front of Kawasaki
station.</p>

<p>Finished my AM lesson with only M in attendance.  We talked about paid
vacation days.  The article mentioned France with people taking 93% of
their 37 available vacation days.  In Japan people took 50% of their
18 vacation days.</p>

<p>M took 5% of his vacation days, and seemed pretty O_o when hearing
about other cultures.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought vacation days were just for emergencies!&rdquo;</p>

<p>hmm..</p>

<p>AB DB primarily consists of two big tables.  Table U has 77k records,
and 160 columns.  Table B has maybe 40k records and maybe 70 columns.
There&rsquo;s a 1-to-many relationship from B to U.  Doing joins on them
takes about 3 or 4 seconds.</p>

<p>That ain&rsquo;t good, considering the joins are done all the frickin time.</p>

<p>I guess that&rsquo;s why when I got the original data, a lot of what&rsquo;s now
in the B table was in the U table.  I was like, &ldquo;normalization to the
rescue!&rdquo; but now it&rsquo;s sloooowwwww.</p>

<p>About 20 columns in table U are varchar 200, so that&rsquo;s 2k UTF-8
characters, so 4k bytes per record (if they&rsquo;re all filled, which
they&rsquo;re not, but it&rsquo;s still overhead that I wonder if I can split into
other tables).</p>

<div class="dream">
In a school, Lin and I walked up some steps to a counter where we were
to pick up our tickets for travel.   The guy was like, do you have
your stripe card? which I had been given but couldn't find at that
moment.  I found it latler in a different pocket of my wallet (change
compartnemtn) and moved it to the first plae I had looked for it,
while thinking of the LPT I had seen regarding this, though Iit was
already a practice I practice.  On the boat, we were headed from Viet
Nam back to Japan and were looking at options for travel.  One way was
shorter but had strong currents against us, but we chose that way
anyway and were turning into the current area when the driver got back
in the boat and I had been turning it.  We were next to some other
boats in this industrial waste wasted sea and there was no food from
the ocean, but a guy had broght ramen.  Lin was looking for food as
she didn't want to eat industrial waste and I was just going to go
hungry instead; it was only one more day.

<p>For years, I have been writing my journal entries in directories based
on the date.  Originally in YYYY/MM directories, and now
(temporarily?) in YYYY/MM/DD directories.</p>

<p>So while recently trying to consolidate all my journal entries, I&rsquo;ve
wanted to maintain that directory structure, lest I have several
thousand(?)  files in one directory.</p>

<p>Travis got me started on Hakyll, but I&rsquo;m too lazy and he&rsquo;s too busy to
update the Haskell source with cool bells and whistles.</p>

<p>I started looking at Pelican, but it choked on all the entries, which
start with <code>---</code> as the first line.  Hmm lemme do a quick search.</p>

<p>Okay I found
<a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/issues/607">Add yaml Reader</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/pull/29">YAML importer for Emacs org-mode posts</a>,
so maybe it&rsquo;s easily possible.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m looking at Middleman, and I liked Hexo, but <a href="/journal/2015/02/12/middleman-and-hexo.md">blah blah blah</a>(*)..</p>

<p>but in ANY case, I still have found a big annoyance with implementing
any of these static site genrators: my journal entries are the biggest
part of the repo!</p>

<p>SO, I&rsquo;ve made a separate repo which just has my journal entries, in
YYYY/MM(/DD) directories.</p>

<p>But still, even this solution has the fatal flaw of a shload of broken
links, especially to /images directory.</p>

<p>(*) I&rsquo;ve used the link &ldquo;/journal/2015/02/12/middleman-and-hexo.md&rdquo; but
I&rsquo;m thinking now of switching to
/journal/2015/02/12middleman-and-hexo.md because its easier for me to
find&hellip;.  ohhhhh I know.  I&rsquo;ll tell the static site generator to use
/journal/2015/02/12/middleman-and-hexo but the file will be at
/journal/2015/02/12middleman-and-hexo.md so I can find the entries a
bit more easily in my file folders.</p>

<p>In one month I have between 0 and maybe 100 entries, so that&rsquo;s fine to
have them all in one directory.  But if I add the extra DD directory,
it&rsquo;s harder for me to find the files because I&rsquo;m 30 times less likely
to remember the date something happened than I am the month it
happened.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;ve got to roll through all the directories and fix the filenames.</p>

<code>auto-fill-mode</code> for the buffer:</p>
