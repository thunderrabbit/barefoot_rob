<p><p>The machine I wanted to convert to linux, apparently, for no apparent reason, has broken.</p>

<p><p>It was so cute - Win 95 with almost no drivers, almost nothing on the disk..  I copied to floppies a couple of files that I wanted to keep, and I was ready to install linux.</p>

<p><p>Taking an inventory of the machine, I booted it a couple times to see what chipset was on the video card.  It didn&rsquo;t say how much memory was on the card, so I powered down and removed the card.  I couldn&rsquo;t really tell, so I put the card back in.</p>

<p><p>Turned it on and got angry BEEEEEPs back.  No signal to the monitor.  What???  All I did was remove and replace the video card.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ve tried another video card and it did not work.  I have no idea what I may have done.  Sigh.  It was a PII 233.  Do I need a new motherboard?  New CPU?  What could I have done?</p>

<p><p>Crazy!</p>

<p><p>I just finished doing laundry and thought, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry.&rdquo;  My inner voice pointed toward Kroger.  &ldquo;Go eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>So I&rsquo;m sittin&rsquo; in Kroger, eating eggs and biscuits and contemplating life.</p>

<p><p>Suddenly I see Tony, one of my warrior brothers.  Recognition smiles across our faces.  &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>He&rsquo;s all, &ldquo;what are you up to?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just sittin&rsquo; in Kroger, eating eggs and biscuits and contemplating life.   In general I&rsquo;m working saving money to go to Australia in November.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re kidding.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No; I&rsquo;m very excited about it!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Turns out Tony lived in Australia for 5 years, and still has contacts there who he said would be happy to give Jason and I a place to stay!!  WOW!!</p>

<p><p>Great stories he told of racing yachts and of Sydney and beaches and the whole fun lifestyle the Aussies live.  We only talked for like 10 minutes, but I gave him my card and he&rsquo;ll get me in touch with his homies.  So awesome.</p>

<p><p>Thank you Angels.</p>

<p>Yeah that never came to fruition.</p>

<p>##21 May 1999</p>

<p><p>Here is our itinerary as faxed from my travel agent. It may change, but probably will not.</p>

<p><p>Quote: Qantas Vacations</p>

<ul>
<li>Nov 5 - Depart Houston to Sydney
<li>Nov 6 - Arrive Sydney 1 night hotel reserved
<li>.
<li>Nov 10 - Depart Sydney to Ayers Rock (Qantas)
<br>3 nights at Emu Walk Apartments [eating grubs with aborigines]
<li>.
<li>Nov 13 - Depart Ayers Rock to Sydney (Qantas) 1 night hotel reserved
<li>. [ go to Gladstone (Great Barrier Reef area) ]
<li>Nov 17 - Helicopter from Gladstone to Heron Island
<li>5 nights at Heron Island Resort [lots of scuba diving]
<li>Nov 22 - Catamaran from Heron Island to Gladstone
<li>.
<li>Dec 11 - Depart Cairns to Houston
</ul>

<p><p>Price per person is $3500, unless we share a bathroom with someone at Heron Island, it&rsquo;s $3280.</p>

<p><p>Notice the big chunks of time indicated by gaps on the list.  I&rsquo;m thinking I&rsquo;ll request that the [ go to Gladstone ] gap be enlarged and shrink the Nov 22 to Dec 11 gap some, unless Gladstone is a long ass way to Cairns.  Maybe we&rsquo;ll hop over to New Zealand during that time.</p>

<p><p><b>STATE OF MY LIFE</b></p>

<p><p><ol></p>

<p><p><li>Jason and I are going to Australia in November.  That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re working to save some dollars now.  We&rsquo;ll also take scuba lessons so we can dive while there.</li></p>

<p><p><li>This morning I was pondering the phases of my life since high school in terms of Big Focii Of My Life.
<br>Graduated high school in 1988.
<br>Spent 2 years at North Harris County College.
<br>Spent 5 years at University of Houston (3.5 years barefoot with frisbee)
<br>Spent 2.5 years working at Telecheck
<br>Spent 1 year not working at Telcheck, part way working on my businesses (website design with <a href="https://www.mrlaboratories.com">MR Labs</a>, internet sales with <a href="https://www.flash.net/~robnugen">Flash Net</a>)</li></p>

<p><p>This most recent phase is where I am now, and I&rsquo;m beginning to add something to it.. on the surface, it appears that I&rsquo;m traveling a lot and riding roller coasters all over the US (well, I&rsquo;ve just gotten started but that&rsquo;s the idea).  I&rsquo;m creating a book during/of this process.  The book is a prototype for my big coffee table book which I&rsquo;ll create when a have funding from some wealthy entity.</p>

<p><p>Under the surface of all this travel and roller coasters and fun is an intangible something..  a belief that life doesn&rsquo;t have to be hard.. a set of beliefs:
<ul>
<li>I don&rsquo;t have to work a 9-5 job
<li>I don&rsquo;t have to work at all to be a good person
<li>I can do what I love and the money will follow
<li>I trust that the universe will provide me with any resources I need
<li>I can teach other people the same thing
</ul></p>

<p><p>This last one is a big part of my coaster book - that I can teach by example that anyone can do whatever they want to do.  Just believe and trust and go do it.</p>

<p><p>We are souls having a human experience.  The soul knows we cannot die, but the human ego does not.  Con<em>sole</em> your ego, &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re scared, but trust me this will be fun.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p><li>Part of me thinks that people will read the above and be all, &ldquo;what a load of crap!!&rdquo; but I trust that someone will read it and connect.  For that person who wants to learn more, email Janice or Jeff about <a href="https://www.jeffdurstconsulting.com/heart.htm">Project Heart</a>.  This is the course that has really helped me believe I can do it.  Also read Conversations with God by Neale Walsch, also read Your Heart&rsquo;s Desire by Sonia Choquette.</p>

<p><p><li>Jason and I will work again today; should finish with the job we started yesterday, and will likely get another job to start tomorrow.</li></p>

<p></ol></p>

                        <p class=date>9pm Tuesday 19 May 1999</p>

<p><p>Today Jason and I worked for a few hours pulling phone cables down walls at a company where I installed about 28 cables, but hadn&rsquo;t pulled them down the walls.  We didn&rsquo;t have exactly the right tools to use, but we had a lot of fun and got most of them done.</p>

<p><p>We could have finished them all, but at noon, we had to leave.  I asked Renee, &ldquo;have you ever listened to KTRU?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I told her and then explained we would be leaving before completing the job and she could listen to us on the radio!</p>

<p><p>Packed up, went home, cleaned up, to the station, cued up a record and we had a blast.  Jason focused a lot on the ska stack, and the general stack, and I played pretty much whatever he gave me.  We inadvertantly played a song &ldquo;I want to be a punk&rdquo; by the Blanks 77 that said &ldquo;fuck you&rdquo; in it 13 times, but the voice was pretty much unintelligible; I didn&rsquo;t even notice until the end of the song since I was busy on the phone and stuff.</p>

<p><p>Got lots of requests on the phone (I guess that&rsquo;s what happens with a day shift), and was able to play about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> of them.  I couldn&rsquo;t find the rest, though I&rsquo;m sure part of that is simply due to my lack of knowledge about where various artists are located.</p>

<p><p>At one point I found Jimi Hendrix playing a live version of &ldquo;Wild Thing&rdquo; and I was all, cool! and went to play that back to back with Kermit the Frog&rsquo;s rendition of &ldquo;Wild Thing&rdquo; and Kermit CD was missing!!!</p>

<p><p>I was angry that someone would steal the Kermit Unpigged CD, and I told the station manager it was missing.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We pulled it out of the stacks; it was never supposed to be here in the first place, and it was being played <b>way</b> too much.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well can I have it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sure.  As long as you don&rsquo;t play it here.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Yay!!!  So the CD is recovered into my private collection.</p>

<p><p>Though it took a while, Jason finally became more comfortable talking on the air, not a lot, but that&rsquo;s cool.</p>

<p><p>At one point I had <em>Less Than Jake</em> CD cued up for him.  &ldquo;So Jason, what can you tell me about this band that I don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Who me?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Um, yes, not anyone else.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re&hellip;good.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>(pause)</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Okay fair enough,&rdquo; I laughed and played the song.</p>

<p><p>Wende came in (she had the afternoon off work) and helped choose CDs and helped me find some requested songs. That was great.  She found The Judys for me, and something else.</p>

<p><p>She was even more mic shy than Jason, but when she gave me a CD to play for her I was all, &ldquo;so Wende, what song is this?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>(silence)</p>

<p><p>I turned the mic toward her, &ldquo;all ears are on you&hellip;&rdquo; I taunted.</p>

<p><p>Finally she overcame her fear. &ldquo;This is I-three with blah blah blah&rdquo; whatever it was.</p>

<p><p>Jason goes, &ldquo;very professional.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Then she even gave the name of the CD and I played it.</p>

<p><p>But, for the Big Huge Culmination of our show, we sang The Yogi Bear song live with no intro, no rehearsal, nothin.  It was great!  All you YRUUers would love it!  Jason has a tape of the show and most of the song recorded.  (I forgot to hit Record for the first 3 verses)</p>

<p><p>A song finished, I turned on the mic, we sang, I turned off the mic, I played another song.</p>

<p><p>Our shift was soon over, though the next DJ hadn&rsquo;t come in.  Meg said she would cover for him.  I put in Frankenstein Symphony and we left.</p>

<p></pre></p>

<p><p>Does anyone have a laptop I can buy or that you wanna give me?  I&rsquo;d really enjoy writing my journal entries in the moment, at the park, instead of reconstructing the excitement a month later.</p>

<p><p><b>Six Flags Great America</b> greets its visitors with a big blue twisty loopy coaster to the left of the park entrance.  Seven inversions.  I counted them.  Wow.</p>

<p><p>I came to the park with Carina and Nate, who had brought me here and come with us, respectively.  I know Carina from YRUU, and Nate is a friend of hers from the Navy.  (Yes, this is Dane&rsquo;s sister Carina)</p>

<p><p>While in line, I commented on the coolness of the big blue twisty coaster.  &ldquo;What is the name of that ride?&rdquo;  Neither Carina nor Nate knew.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Shockwave&rdquo; came the answer from someone almost as excited as me. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not even the coolest coaster.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Whoah.</p>

<p><p>Of course, Raging Bull was all the rage today.  A brand new ride that boasts an underground tunnel and seventy three mile per hour first drop!!  I could see its maroon track with big orange supports through the trees.  It did look impressive.</p>

<p><p>Raging Bull, I was assured, was the superlative ride of the year.  A group of bouncing high schoolers vowed to head straight for the ride.  I boasted that they better run or get out of my way.</p>

<p><p>The gates opened; I zipped through the gate and ran toward the looming orange coaster, only to be stopped by the rope.  What???</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not 10 o&rsquo;clock yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Ack.</p>

<p><p>Before the park opened for real, we were packed like sardines behind an employee-guarded rope, waiting for 10 am.  I squoozed myself to the front of the crowd (not too difficult as I had been one of the first people in the park) and looked back for Carina and Nate.</p>

<p><p>They finally made it.  Turns out Nate&rsquo;s big Texan belt buckle had set off the alarms and he had to take it off to go through the metal detector.</p>

<p><p>Several minutes later (still before 10), &ldquo;Raging Bull is not going to be open this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Most of the excited crowd hadn&rsquo;t heard that the coaster was still sleeping and wouldn&rsquo;t be ready.  I informed the bouncing high school group, who said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna wait in line anyway!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>As time grew near, many people in the crowd crowed, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s 10 o&rsquo;clock!&rdquo;  &ldquo;it&rsquo;s 10 oh five!&rdquo; and others, but that didn&rsquo;t seem to help.</p>

<p><p>Finally a couple of other employees walked up.  They were all, &ldquo;OKAY!  DO NOT CROSS THE ROPE!   WE WILL LEAD YOU TO &lsquo;SOUTHWEST TERRITORY!&rsquo; RAGING BULL IS NOT OPEN!  DO NOT CROSS THE ROPE!&rdquo; kinda thing and they walked us like a giant amoeba to the Southwest Territory where all hell broke loose toward the Bull with me thinking, &ldquo;Where do I go????&rdquo;   Since I was not going to wait in line for a coaster that might not open today when tons of other rides were available.</p>

<p><p>A small black loopy thing was there, and I searched for its entrance.  I saw a group walking super fast.  &ldquo;Where is the entrance for this???&rdquo;   They guy told me, but added, &ldquo;it won&rsquo;t get busy; Batman or Iron Wolf is better!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Perfect.  That is exactly what I wanted to know.  But where oh where is Batman?  &ldquo;Come with us; that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re going.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I lost Nate and Carina but they didn&rsquo;t want to walk as fast as me.  I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll find them later.</p>

<p><p>As we walked, I met my new friend Peter, and his brothers(?) and little sister Megan.</p>

<p><p>We actually rode Iron Wolf first.  It&rsquo;s a stand up ride, pretty compact and speedy, including a loop and other cool stuff.  Peter waited for the front car; I just rode the thing in first available seat.  Super nice ride, with some good drops and some head shaking.  Pretty zippy toward the ground at the end and overall I&rsquo;ll rate it 3.5 of 5.  They were running two trains, so there was no line when my ride ended so I rode again!  This time I moved to the back car.  I got 9 pics while on the ride.  I gotta get a digital camera.</p>

<p><p>Peter and crew waited for me (thank them very much), and we went to Batman.</p>

<p><p>We zipped through the turnstiles and only had to wait 5 trains to ride in the front seat!  Batman is a suspended looping coaster, 4 seats across.  Super awesome nice ride!  It has 2 loops and 3 corkscrews, all black track with beautiful though compact terrain with nice willow trees and a pond thing..  Wow!  Especially when right out of one twisty loop, we zip down for a near crash splash in the water.  (Choose the left hand seats on this ride; you get closer to the water, and better view of the crowd on the ground)</p>

<p><p>Oh oh oh! And I rode it barefoot!  yeah!</p>

<p><p>I give Batman The Ride a 4.5 of 5.  Very nice ride.  Choice: left hand side, front or back seat.</p>

<p><p>We rode it once, ran down the ramp, and the line was long as hell.  Cool.  Well, not cool, but cool that we didn&rsquo;t have to wait.</p>

<p><p>Now that the lines were long, we went to Shockwave, the big blue twisty thing near the front of the park.  I rode in the middle of the train with Meagan, Peter&rsquo;s sister.  I got several pics while waiting for the train, but zero while on it this time.</p>

<p><p>This ride is at least 3.5 of 5.  It&rsquo;s not as fast as the others, but long and tall and spindly, like Shockwave at Six Flags Over Texas.  Long curving entrance drop, then up up up into a tight loop.  Long curve again then two loops in a row.  Curve again and then a pretzel (two inversions) and back then around and two corkscrews in a row.  On a different time I rode Shockwave, I got a beautiful pic while on the corkscrew.  Looking through the corkscrew, perfectly framed is a US flag.  Nice nice nice.</p>

<p><p>Now, back at the park entrance, we had made one circuit of the park and began again toward Southwest Territory and Raging Bull.  The Bull was still closed, and Peter et.al. declared The Viper line was too long, so we rode Demon.</p>

<p><p>Demon is the loopy black coaster I had eyed first before finding Peter and gang.  This was is fun; it has big rocky terrain around it and even has a big loop around a rock arch thing.  Two loops then a tunnel and two corkscrews make this a fun ride.  I give it a 3 of 5 (2.5 without the terrain).  Great ride for beginners.</p>

<p><p>Now to the back of the park to ride American Eagle.  I got a pic of vacant turnstiles before the ride.  American Eagle is a big classic wooden coaster with twin tracks.  During Halloween season, the trains are run backwards.  The train is vibraty jiggly as hell and has a huge slow spiral acceleration track after the first big drop and answering ascent.</p>

<p><p>I got pictures on the ride, and casually put my camera in my lap when Peter said, &ldquo;camera ahead.&rdquo;  There&rsquo;s a camera taking pics of riders so the park might make a few extra dollars selling them at the end of the ride.</p>

<p><p>Classic wooden coasters are not my favorite; I love the speed, but this was nice; I give it a 3.5 or 4 of 5.</p>

<p><p>Peter and crew left.  The lines are long.  We rode all that before noon.</p>

<p><p>I meandered around the park after getting Peter&rsquo;s email address (haven&rsquo;t emailed him yet, but will after this entry is complete) and found myself on Iron Wolf.  The line is almost an hour long.  I rode near the back. Yay!!</p>

<p><p>Found Carina (actually she found me) near American Eagle.  They were munching messy chili dogs and nachos.  After food, we rode Cajun Cliffhangar, a ride that spins so riders are held against the wall while the floor drops out from below riders&rsquo; feet.  Big fun.  We got on there and Holli the ride op was on the intercom, &ldquo;welcome to Cajun Cliffhanger, please stay flat against the wall and &hellip;.  will you put your shoes back on please?&rdquo; she said to me.  :-)  The ride was fun, even while wearing shoes.</p>

<p><p>Nate and I chilled while Carina made a phone call.  She took a long ass time, so we went to ride Shockwave again.  I left her a note by the bench where we had been sitting.</p>

<p><p>The ride was great, and Carina was on a different bench.  She hadn&rsquo;t gotten the note.  I hopped over to where the other had been and some little junior high girls were all, &ldquo;are you Carina?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; I said, and they giggled and gave me the note.</p>

<p><p>I brought it back to Carina, who didn&rsquo;t want it, so I gave it back to the girls.  One was all, &ldquo;why would we want it?&rdquo;  Another piped up, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep it!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>We still rode more rides and I rode rides the next day.  But now, literally as I write this, Wende and I are off to Fiesta Texas to ride more coasters.  Maybe maybe I&rsquo;ll write more quickly!</p>

<p><p><b>STATE OF MY LIFE</b></p>

<p><p><ol></p>

<p><p><li>Jason Fricke called me back on the morning of the Friday that Wende and I went to Six Flags over Texas.  The short version is that he invited me to Australia with him for four months.  Four months!!!???  Nope nope nope couldn&rsquo;t do it, and turned him down altogether, but I thought about it and decided I could go for one month.  So the plan is for Jason and I to go to Australia(!!!) from 5 November to like 11 December 1999. More <a href="australia/index.html">here</a>.</li></p>

<p><p><li>I found a super cool applet composer by <a href="https://www.opencube.com">www.opencube.com</a> and I made a cool applet with it, but turns out that not all of them are free.  I&rsquo;ll have to pay $189 to get this applet on my site.</li></p>

<p><p><li>I lost my camera.  I had it after Six Flags over Texas, but not at Astroworld when we went last weekend.  Pooh.  I&rsquo;m taking Wende&rsquo;s tomorrow.</li></p>

<p><p><li>Tomorrow (actually today in 6 hours) I&rsquo;m going to fly to Chicago to attend Six Flags Great America!!!!!!!!  My friend Carina will pick me up from the airport and I&rsquo;ll crash at her crib and we&rsquo;ll check out the park Saturday and maybe Sunday.</li></p>

<p><p><li>Today I had fun at KTRU.  I played both sides of a 12 inch vinyl called something like &ldquo;Alice in Wonderland&rdquo; by Magilla Gorilla.  Cute and funny.  Also funny was when Side One ended, I played DJ Silver &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Panic&rdquo; and told listeners &ldquo;don&rsquo;t panic; I&rsquo;m turning the record over.&rdquo;  No one panicked.  No one even called during my shift.  &lsquo;Cept for Wende, but that doesn&rsquo;t count.</li></p>

<p><p><li>I just started my <a href="australia/index.html">Australia</a> pages. Now it&rsquo;s 2:40am.  I have to pack and leave my house in less than 4 hours.</li>
</ol></p>

G -

Georgia was pretty cool, and so is Brandie!  We went to Six Flags (she
didn't ride any rides) and went to a park around there.   The rides
were fairly cool; however, the new Batman ride wasn't as cool as I had
expected.  Don't get me wrong, it was pretty cool, but the line was
two hours, and I liked the Georgia Scorcher better.  I also rode
Viper, which has five (count 'em, 5) inversions and was really quite
cool, especially considering that it wasn't made by B&M or Vekoma.
(It was probably Arrow Dynamics.)  I didn't get any pictures, as I
left my cameras in the car.  That's okay, though, since I'll be
spending 2-3 months in Georgia this summer.  I talked to one of the
guys there, and he really really me to work with him because of my
math background.  I told him that I had decided on attending Stanford,
but that I'd love to work with him in the summer, and he accepted!  

So I'm gonna finish my thesis in record time, and be off to Georgia
shortly thereafter.  That puts some constraints on when I can go to
Six Flags (over Texas) and Astroworld, but opens up the possibility--
no, the eventuality-- that I'll go to Busch Gardens and Paramount's
King's Dominion in Virginia.  I may also go to Boston for Memorial Day
weekend with some friends here.  Fucked up, huh?  

Well, I've got to get to work.

<p><p>Jason called me and we began discussing plans.  He&rsquo;s been before, and wants to re-experience Heron Island on the Great Barrier Reef, but this time scuba certified.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ve been before and want to re-experience Katoomba Falls, but this time when their roller coaster is open (Australian summer).</p>
