<p>The manager of Kinko's is helping a guy next to me and they were
making smalltalk.  The manager goes, "you know you're getting old when
your little brother graduates and starts getting a job."</p>

<p>I guess I won't get old for a while...</p>

<p>In Plano YRUU now.  The Sai Baba followers (I don't know what they
call themselves) are here each week.  A few weeks ago one of the
leader types gave me a stapled pack of literature, none of which I
have read since he gave it to me.</p>

<p>He inquired about it, and I was all, "um, I haven't read all of it,
but there's some very interesting stuff in there."  I guess there is.</p>

<p>Simon was talking about the girls in his debate class at school.
He thinks they're kinda cool and Marta was all, "but what about you
only liking YRUU girls?"</p>

<p>Simon goes "they're liberal so I can relate."</p>

<p>I go "and debate."</p>

<p>Simon: "what?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. sorry, mate."</p>

<p>"Don't do that!"</p>

<p>"too late."</p>

<p>hahahaha from the group.</p>

<p>me: "don't hate!"</p>

<p class=date>6:26pm</p>

<p>Jackie just paid me the dollar for the naming rights to Jackie
Purdy's Game, which we will hopefully play after checkin.  I'll give
fifty cents to Wende.  heehee I can direct deposit it.</p>

<p>Jackie points out that "Kate" rhymes as well.</p>

<p>Kate's birthday is on Wednesday.  Jackie's is this Friday.</p>

<p class=date>6:32pm</p>

<p>Leigh met a woman at the vet whose dog is named Dog, pronounced
"Dee-o-gee."</p>

<p class=date>6:53pm</p>

<p>At the risk of being un-youth empowering, I directed a conversation
about what YRUU means to each person, and then a short soap box on
what this incredible community can be to people if they choose to
accept the power.</p>

<p>Then I described how the YAC is designed the mouthpiece of the
youth group, allowing the church to understand what the youth
want.</p>

<p>Okay, now who wants to be on YAC???!!!</p>

<p>(no response)</p>

<p>que sera sera.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>In a something above the ground like 40 feet up and one
of my youth jumped out and his parachute didn't open so he kinda
bonked on the ground, but he was okay.  He pulled his parachute out
like gosh darn stupid parachute!  and then he tossedthe top part of a
rop up to me and it took a few tries but I caught it and then pulled
him up to our level again.  Since the parachute was already open, I
dropped him down and it worked nicely.   He floated down to the ground
very slowly.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class=dream>Near my dad's house, I was dropped off by the
elementary school and Colleen Crotty (Saube) was there and she was
trying to get home, but it started to rain a bit - a cold rain so she
started jogging and I jogged along with her to make sure she got home
safely.  We got up to my dad's street and Fred was there chillin' in a
van with a bunch of stuff on the hood and I was all, "let me borrow
it" and he started throwing the stuff (skates, blankets, etc) into the
van.  Colleen got in and I was driving and Fred stood on the sideboard
as I drove slowly to Colleen's house (not too far away).</p>

<p class=dream>Some cattle were standing in the road, and one
particularly bullheaded (or just dumb) cow was standing there and we
actually pushed him out of the way with the van.  Then we had to get
through the gate that led into her neighborhood and it seemed really
narrow but I used some sort of extension on the van to push part of
the gate open on both sides; it was like a piece of sheetmetal hanging
on some rebar pegs extending horizontally from the vertical wooden
posts on either side of the gate.</p>

<p>Another dream was something about work, but I don't remember.</p>

<p class=dream>something about my ex-work.</p>

<p>Is this a bit insane?  Maybe.  I came to Kinko's to work on Kim
Sawyer's website and got a message from Janette that I can make $100
working for her today, so I'm going to zip over there and put Kim's
project on hold and make $100, but the crazy thing is that I haven't
100% confirmed that the $100 job is still available.  I'm just
hoping.</p>

<p class=date>3:32pm</p>

<p>Made it to Dallas and found no Janette at her house, but Jack via
telephone helped me find their address book and I called Janette's
work.  I'll see her there soon.</p>

<p class=date>6:02pm</p>

<p>We're back at Bibby's for a break.  Her break more than mine of
course; I've only worked almost 2 hours.  This fabric that we're
working with is WAY lighter and smaller than that hugemongous fucking
curtain that we did last time.  That was ridiculous.  This fabric is a
lightweight simple weave polyester, only 20 feet long at a time
instead of 40, and we don't have to sew them all together into a
monstrosity 110 feet wide and 40 feet tall.</p>

<p>Just a simple hem along all the edges.  I pin them up and she
sews.  Easy.</p>

<p>But we're still takin' a break.</p>

<p class=date>6:59pm</p>

<p>Ate crackers and peanut butter and I finished the bag of Chips Ahoy
that was brought there some weeks ago by Sean's friends who brought
two other snacks, like trail mix and cheese nips, both were hot
flavor, which was quite distressing to Sean.  The Chips Ahoy were
mostly untouched for those weeks except by me, who may have eaten all
of them.</p>

<p>I don't have my wallet.  Hmm.  I'll drive extra carefully on the
way back.</p>

<p class=date>12:17am</p>

<p>Finished.  Going to Bibby's now.</p>

<p class=date>1:45am</p>

<p>Now I'm back in Denton at Marta's, and feel a bit guilty since the
apartment has been cleaned up of all my crap that was all over the
living room.  Okay, it wasn't all over, but more like in a pile in the
center.</p>

<p>It got all cleaned up by Marta because Cherub and Dale are coming
over tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>On the way home from Dallas, I called Becky (my dad's sister) in
Florida where she is staying with their mom, but will be going back to
West Virginia in about a week.  Great to talk to her about how all the
family is doing.</p>

<p>Erin Dunn emailed this to me:</p>

<h1>A speech on the findings of Silent Football and its culture</h1>

<p>* Clears throat * stands on a soapbox and peers through the cracks
in the wooded podium. Gets down and adds two or three more
soapboxes. * Smiles * Good work done...now can see the crowd of eager
faces.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen and veterans of archeology I have come upon a
new civilization. This civilization is called Young Religious
Unitarian Universalists. They speak a language that I am confused with
and have yet to master. They seem to have a sort of religious ceremony
called Silent Football. For there is a science to this so called
"ritual" it has a science attached to it. There is one person whom is
called "Mister Dicktator" his name is formulized in three parts. He
must be the chief...the head of the clan. His name is sacred. It
compiles of three parts, one part meaning a male address such as sir,
mister, master, prince, king, or pope. Then the second part which is
of meaning for a male genitalia such as dick, penis, shaft, one-eyed
trouser snake, cock and so on. The third part is qute amusing I have
found. The third part of his name is any meaning for a potato! When
addressing Mister Dicktator you may make up a new variation meaning
his name or you may use the name he has. But you must always address
him first and direct your comments to him. Are there any questions so
far?"</p>

<p>* Looks around the room at the ogling eyes and smiles *</p>

<p>"Good then we shall move on. There are several basic movements that
are used in this ritual which move an invisible substance called the
"sacred football", You may not move this "sacred football" more than
three people to your left or right. Mister Dictator the leader is the
one that starts this movement with a certain motion called a "PHWAP".
This "PHWAP" is a very curious movement to me. With my own eyes did I
witness the magic of this movement!"</p>

<p>* audience gasps *</p>

<p>* taps a hammer on the podium *</p>

<p>"Please people, please try to keep your focus. This is no matter to
be discussed. It is a simple magic that moves the "Sacred
Football". The science of it is this: the formula to a "PHWAP" is to
simply slapping one's own knee and that automatically moves the sacred
football to the left or to the right."</p>

<p>* more gasps *</p>

<p>"Please ladies and gentlemen keep your focus. I tell of truth. I
have seen with my own eyes this sacred ritual. This ritual can last
from one minute to 5-6 hours. This is nothing that is to be taken
lightly. It is some kind of worshipping process that these children
and adults go through. As and archeologist and anthropologist I take
into consideration these things. This culture is quite
fascinating. There are certain defensive moves too of course for
protection against this "Sacred Football" and it power."</p>

<p>* a man in the crowd stands up and shouts out "What kind of powers
does this "sacred Football" hold? Is it a danger to all who come
across it?"  the man then sits back down as the crowd mumbles and
whispers amongst one another. *</p>

<p>"To my research the only danger to this "Sacred Football" is to the
person who loses it. That is when the members of the circle raise
their hands and are addressed by Mister Dicktator and they act in
council to what the mistake was made and the member who made the error
is then given a half penance point or is told to stand up in the
middle of the circle and dance while the others sing a sort of
purification song to rid the member of all ill karma. The "Sacred
Football" holds only the power to move without being seen.</p>

<p>There is another way to move the "Sacred Football" to another
member that is not three spaces to your left or right. It is called a
Zoom. It is a highly popular and less painful way of sending the
"Sacred Football". The science to the zoom is simply by raising ones
arm in a fashion that looks to be as if you are going to punch someone
and you make a fist. You then point your arm to the person that wish
to receive the gift of the "Sacred Football" or to the member that the
"Sacred Football" told you to send it too. In this culture the gift
can be denied by these defensive moves. If the member feels that they
are not ready to yet handle the power of the "Sacred Football". They
may use a shrug, which the formula to that is simply by raising your
two shoulders and then setting them back down. Or you can use a
shrodum, which is a more complicated motion. It entails more intricate
motions as follows: you must move your right arm to your front and
then make your fingertips touch your forehead. Then in a ballet type
way you swoop your left arm to the front and make your fingers touch
the elbow of the right arm. This then is a shrodum.</p>

<p>There are rules that go with these defensive moves, you may never
shrug a shrodum or shrodum a shrug. That will cause you a penance
point and the destruction of the "Sacred Football". Mister Dicktator
then weeps for the loss, and calls on one of the members to speak. To
move back a little ways to the zoom. There is a rule that goes with
that as well and it is: you may never zoom a zoom, zoom. Just as you
may never phwap a phwap, phwap or shrug a shrug, shrug, or shrodum a
shrodum, shrodum.  Never do anything over the power of three. It will
cause you to destroy the "sacred football" and cause you to have a
penance point and cause (in a raised voice) you to make Mister
Dicktator cry!"</p>

<p>* the crowd claps. A woman stands up. "is there anything more to
this so called ritual? What is the purpose of it?" *</p>

<p>"Madam, the purpose is simple. It is to build the community
stronger.  When a new person comes into the circle Mister Dictator
explains the rules of dealing with the sacred powers of the "Sacred
Football". And yes there is more to this ritual than I have
said. Mister Dictator can at anytime form a "Wormhole" between two to
eight people. It depends on how many people are playing. There can be
two way wormholes that when a member passes the "Sacred Football" to
lets say Mister Dicktator whom has a two way wormhole to Miss I'm not
thinking. The "Sacred Football" is then zapped to Miss I'm not
thinking. The point of these wormholes are to bring two members or
more together in spiritual harmony where they share the power of the
"sacred football"."</p>

<p>* "Wow" is heard from the crowd. *</p>

<p>"The language is especially tricky. They use no pro-nouns for that
causes the "Sacred Football" to be upset. Then the member from the
circle that uttered the heinous pro-noun is then convicted of a
penance point. The ritual carries on. Saying a pro-noun will not cause
the "Sacred Football" to destroy...it will only anger it. There are
rules on the penance points too. If a member has more than five
penance points the "Sacred Football" becomes angry at that soul and
disappears causing the ritual to be over. The circle then sends the
sorry member off on a task while they discuss freely their opinions on
what their ultimate punishment should be. Their names too are of
interest. Each member of the circle makes up a name before the ritual
starts. One person takes notes down on a sacred scroll of all the
events that go on. Mister Dicktator then remembers all the names and
starts the ritual. Each name has a meaning, a sacred meaning to the
owner of the name.</p>

<p>And that ladies and gentlemen concludes my topic today on the
findings of YRUU and their sacred happenings. Silent Football,
remember that. It teaches a great lesson on how to respect others and
to respect rules and to follow them. Silent Football teaches that you
must handle power in a careful way knowing that there are
repercussions to everything that you might do or say."</p>

<p>Got Scott's oil changed and they asked how long it's been since he's
had his radiator flushed and transmission fluid flushed.  They suggest
30,000 and 15,000 miles respectively.</p>

<p>Looking back through Scott's records, I found his radiator flushing
25,000 miles ago.  Did not find a single transmission flush, but I
shall look again.  I've driven Scott 48,000 miles since I got him in
January </p>

<p class=date>8:33pm</p>

<p>At Humperdink's now with Marta, Jenae, Cris, about to munch and
such.  I got my computer out to record any funniness that happens.</p>

<p>We were just at Jenae's brother Jeff's art opening.  Good stuff
that looks very um, fractalish in a way, but with a consistent pattern
on all the pieces.</p>

<p>I picked up a rubberband from the top of a light, by hanging out
over a ledge, stood on the other side of the ledge and held a big
eyehook bolt thing to let myself lean well over the edge to grab this
rubberband off the top of a round hanging light.  Signed it with "ROB
was here 6 September 2002 www.robnugen.com"  Good stuff.</p>

<p class=message>Now we're (ROB, Marta, Jenae and Cris) at
Humperdink's for dinner.  I (Marta) wanted a healthy, vegetarian
choice.  Doctor's order, "No fried foods..." leaves me very limited
here.  I noticed a Ceasar salad on the menu, but was hesitant to order
out of fear that the traditional anchovies would be included in the
sauce.  When I shared this with the others, they were shocked having
never heard of this ingrediant being included.  Cris was also planning
on the Ceasar, but not if anchovies were in it.  I explained that the
nicer places use them.  Jenae was quite disturbed as a lover of Ceasar
salads, "But I don't like anchovies!!"  Rob and I had the same
response, in unison, "But you've been eating them all along and never
noticed!!"  She was not ready to drop the subject as the rest of us
moved on.  Slappimg the table, she begged, "Wait!  Wait!  Explain this
anchovy thing to me!!!"  Together, ROB, Cris and I (with perfect
timing) teased "Well, they're these little fishies..."  Course, when I
asked the waiter (in the interest of all three girls), ROB had to make
a 'crazy' gesture towards me, giving the guy one of those "Sorry, she
forgot her medication..." looks!  Thanks, Gem... Don't forget, I know
where you sleep!  Grrrr!!!  Tee hee hee!!!  ;-)</p>

<p>Chillin' at DFW airport again, this time waiting to pick up Janette
who is returning from California via Denver on Frontier airlines.  I
had no idea there3 was an airline called Frontier, so when I read her
message I was all, "what's frontier?  and what airline is it?"</p>

<p>All is clear now.</p>

<p>Some cats were just interviewing a woman on camera; I dunno why.</p>

<p class=date>8:31pm</p>

<p>At Bibby's house now; Janette had a great trip.  None of the little
cats are here, but we're going to make spaghetti..  :-)</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>I was somewhere and Heather from back in my high school
days called and came to visit!  We hadn't been in touch for a long
time, lke a few years, so it was good to catch up, but we didn't
really talk about much.  When she first saw me, she said, 'you look
good; you look like Mr Reagh,' which was a total compliment  cause he
was one of our best teachers in the world. in high school.  As we were
talking some of my youth fom Northwoods, Susie Scully and Hethre were
being silly and purposely standing  or sitting almost in the way of
our conversaion.  It was funny.</p>

<p>I think it's time I email Heather.</p>

<p>I'm at Kinko's now; I have a small list of things to do, including
get reimbursed for mileage to SWUUSI and Tulsa Rally.</p>

<p>Listening to mp3s, right now "I left my wallet in El Segundo" by A
Tribe Called Quest.</p>

<p>Oh, speaking of music, if you're in Dallas area, check out 106.7,
which seems to play only cool dance music.  I wonder if they stream
over internet.  I'll look.</p>

<p>Ah, next mp3 is Amy Leyenberger's "Greensleeves" on harp.</p>

<p class=date>12:20pm</p>

<p>Got most of my stuff done while listening to a lot of music and
reading a lot of livejournal entries.</p>
