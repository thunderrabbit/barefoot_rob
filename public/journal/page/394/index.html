<p>We're in the airport now, and there seems to be no proof of
electronic confirmation of our tickets.   We paid $72 cash for each
ticket.  The cat here at the airport desk is trying to get us hooked
up.</p>

<p class=date>10:54am</p>

<p>On the plane now.  Made it through the ticketing process; the cats
at Robert's Hawai'i tours were having problems with their e-ticket
stuff.  Then Janette's bag didn't have a routing ticket. blah blah
anyway my bag got examined through the security gate thing.  Lalala
who cares; we're on board.</p>

<p>There's a shower with three walls and no roof on the roof of the
hostel!  I showered there and dried off in the sun, watching the water
pour down into the gutter.  I wonder if they process the water or if
the soap just ends up on the ground..</p>

<p>Janette and I went swimming.  The water is a bit cold and way clear
and the ground was SHARP coral and rocks and ouch ouch ouch to walk
across, especially in shallow water, cause the waves would keep me off
balance and not very bouyant.  buoyant.  floatatious.  Anyway, I have
stab marks on my hands and feet from walking crab walk across the
pokey sharp rocks and coral and such.</p>

<p>It was so much fun!  Janette and I were all "ow! ow! OWWW!! ow!" a
lot and laughing a lot more at ourselves and our respective noises.
Quite entertaining. </p>

<p>Met a cat named Rick out on the coral (wearing shoes) and his
daughter Taylor?  No, it started with a C.  Camper, Cooter, Maybe it
was Taylor.  Anyway she had shoes on too, and they were
snorkling. (not the shoes, the cats.) I definitely want to do that so
I asked if we could borrow his stuff once I found out that he lives
next to the hostel.  I shoulda asked if he knew where we could rent
some; I felt immediately embarassed for having put him in a situation
where he couldn't easily say no.  But whatever; it's all good.</p>

<p>They came out of the water a bit after we did.  Rick and Kimberly
marveled that we were barefoot out there.</p>

<p>Kimberly lives in the hostel, gets free rent by doing all the
cleaning.  She was kickin' back on a towel so I chatted with her a
bit.  Never sat on her towel though.  She used to live in Seattle, but
found herself depressed in the winter so she moved out here where it's
super sunnier all the time.  She's an editor for a local author, but
her real love is dogs and wants to set up a business grooming,
sitting, boarding dogs.</p>

<p>Dolly is Rick's dog, possibly a border collie.  Dolly was chewing
on a fallen palm leaf (and by leaf I mean the big ass entire 7 feet
stalk with the little flappy leaves on it).  I threw it and she
retrieved it several times before she chewed through part of it and
the piece that I was throwing kept getting smaller and smaller.  I'm
amazed that she doesn't have shredded bloody gums after all that
chewing of 'sharp' palm stalk.</p>

<p>Went to dinner at Lotus Blossom where Reenie's son Zach works.  The
most beautiful things:  it's within easy walking distance, and Janette
had no conscious idea of that when booking this awesome hostel; Reenie
peeking toward the kitchen, "Zach??" and Zach coming out all huge
smile, "Hi Mommm." and big big hug and then back up to make sure it's
really mom/Zach and then hug again.  So beautiful to witness.</p>

<p>We each had uber-unique foods: I got flax seed things with
sunflower seed paste; Janette got miso soup and <em>awesome</em>
vegetable pizza with <b>huge</b> slices of vegetables (roasted garlic,
pineapple, grilled onion (as the base), tomato, summer squash) and
crust that was <em><b>better</b></em> than Star Pizza!!!!!  The crust
was made out of spelt (I hope I spelt that correctly) and olive oil.
Actually I think Star Pizza's crust is better in large quantities of
consumption, but on first and second and third taste this crust
*ruled!*</p>

<p>Oh and Reenie got something called Samosas, which I'd never heard
of but she apparently has eaten before.  Potato turnovers with
corriander, tumeric, and cumin seasoning.  And pineapple chutney (I'm
typing as Janette dictates what it was) and puff pastry.</p>

<p>And I got a sample of some nutty soup (and I don't mean it had nuts
in it) but it was onion/apple/black bean soup.  Such a weird flavor!!
I'm glad the cat named Dog suggested that I get a sample instead of a
whole bowl.  Weird weird flavor.  I told him later that I'd like to
try it again on a different day and work my way up to a full bowl.</p>

<p>So there was a cat named Dog there!  His real name is some variant
of David, but I never caught it.  He has bangs but the rest of his
head is buzz cut.  Deep clear eyes when he shook my hand with a
genuine pleasure to meet someone that runs in the same circles as
Zach's mom.</p>

<p>Great great great restaurant.</p>

<p>We're in Austin airport now.  I got a banana through security
without it being checked.  That and my hat.  This is the new TSA
(Transportation Security Administration), and they didn't seem to have
their shit together, lined up ducks, nor a smooth operation.</p>

<p>I had a banana (a real banana, not a gun banana (well, actually
it's a telephone banana)) wrapped in my gilligan hat in the handwarmer
of my hoodie.  I walked through the gate and got beeped (presumably
from the change in my pocket).  The beep now means that I have to get
checked manually, not that I just have to take out more stuff and go
through the gate again.  They had me sit over to the side and gave me
my plastic 'bucket' of stuff which had already gone through the
X-rayer.  After I got beeped, I put my hat and banana into the
bucket.</p>

<p>When the guy checked me, the bucket was not checked again.  A
possible solution is to not give the passenger access to the bucket
until they (and all their hats and bananas) have been checked.  I
wondered about saying some polite variation of "haha! I got a banana
through without it being checked, you not-so-secure TSA suckers!!!"
and chose not to.  I might write them, but I know I won't.  Maybe they
search all internet sites for language about TSA.</p>

<p>Interesting place for the government to check is all of Google's
files.  It's all public information; I wonder what it would take to
scan it all for certain language.</p>

<p>HOLY SHIT! I HAVE WIRELESS ACCESS IN THE AIRPORT!!!!!</p>

<p>Oh, nevermind; it's not free.</p>

<p class=date>9:27am</p>

<p>Hahah the pilot of the plane facing us in the window opened the
windshield and was adjusting or cleaning something on another window.
Janette noticed him and I jumped up, "get back into the plane, sir;
please take your seat!"</p>

<p class=date>9:29am</p>

<p>sigh.  nevermind.</p>

<p>Okay.  kinda watching the news, but mostly dancing around not like
a Rob's crazy dance, but a little knee wigglin' shoulder groovin' with
some beat box on top.  ANYWAY, the news was featuring a woman who
raises cacti (shit is it cactii or cacti?) in the area.  And spent 30
seconds showing/listening to her tale of how she learned to use a
paintbrush to remove leaves from inside the cactus so she wouldn't get
stuck with cactus needles.</p>

<p>I'm all, "monkeys invented tools like that.  ya gotta feature this
on the news?"</p>

<p>Then I'm all, "maybe this is better than a news story of how a guy
killed someones mom, dad, seven brothers and seven sisters."</p>

<p class=date>1:29pm CST Saturday 8 February 2003</p>

<p>On the descent now to San Diego.  Clouds and then sleeping kept me
from seeing out the window until we got to some pretty fly mountain
ranges.  I always enjoy watching from flying.  Coolest was a jet going
under us opposite direction FAST.</p>

<p>Saddest was just the scars of highways across the natural beauty of
mountain and desert terrain.</p>

<p class=date>11:46am PST Saturday 8 February 2003</p>

<p>Switched to PST.  We're chillin' on the plane and will switch to
the other side so my neck can get untwisted for the flight to
Oakland.</p>

<p class=date>12:51pm PST Saturday 8 February 2003</p>

<p>Above middle California now.  Flying over mountains.  I enjoy
wondering about the ocean though.  I can see where the water is
apparently flat with no or very few (or very little) waves.  Sometimes
this seems to be the result of a boat going by, leaving a flat area of
water.  But sometimes the areas are huge and or really wiggly.  Is
that from a really big boat having passed by some time ago (no boat in
sight)?  Or does the wind just stop there or run one way on one side
of the flat and the other way on the other side of the flat part?</p>

<p>Oooooh special thanks to the steward who gave me a full can of OJ
instead of a dinky cup with OJ but mostly ice.</p>

<p class=date>2:50pm PST Saturday 8 February 2003</p>

<p>Oops.  Someone left Janette's suitcase on the bus.  He just split
back to the airport while we were trying to figure out how to get
tickets to take BART to Colma station to take another bus to get to
SFO.  Janette is inquiring about the suitcase with the next next
driver.  Twenty minutes until suitcase comes back.  Nice.</p>

<p class=date>4:34pm PST Saturday 8 February 2003</p>

<p>San Francisco airport now.  We'll be meeting Janette's friend Reene
(sp) soon.  She's checked in, but we haven't found her yet.  Our
flight leaves at 6pm.</p>

<p>Traded smiles with a cutie who apparently has a boyfriend so I
didn't talk to her.  When I saw her later getting on the bus she and
he seem to have plenty of baggage.  As we were waiting at the carousel
for Janette and Reenie's relatively small bags, tons of huge bags were
pouring onto the conveyor and I'm just thinking "fuckin' americans..."
with all their belongings and stuff stuff stuff.</p>

<p>The cutie and her boyfriend are on the bus one seat up from us
across the aisle.  fuckin' stalker.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Oh, on the way out of the airport we saw a box labeled AMNESTY BOX,
and Janette was all, "that's the last chance to drop off your monkey."</p>

<p>Hahah  'Okay, Bobo, you stay here while I go run around the island!'</p>

<p>THE FUCKKING PERL HARBOUR MEMORIAL IS NOT THE HISTORY OF HAWAII!!</p>

<p>Jesus the fucking video that they're showing us on the bust (and
Ihave engouh problems with a vidoe on the bus at all I mean shit we
have *REALITY* outside the bus to watch and they are advertising all
this stuff to see but what, oh pray tell what gets fully TWO MINUTES
of airplay on this video?  Not about the King Hakeakeala (or whatever
his name is that I don't know because it was only said once and I
don't know the real history of Hawaii) but the damn Perl Harbour
monument with <em>footage of the bombing</em> and then two fuckin old
guys all "yeahp, that was a real good tour (of the memorial) if ya
wanna know about the history of Hawaii."</p>

<p>WHAT?  WHAT?  Good god man!  Get the fuck over it! The only reason
the harbour was bombed is cause we were taking over the island,
destroying its culture, starting with kidnapping the queen of the
island so that Mr Dole could have cheaper access to pineapples and
shit.  Argh oh jeez.  Okay .  Okay.  Okay.  I'm okay.  ish.  </p>

<p>The hostel where Janette intended to make a reservation didn't have
a room reserved for her, so we walked toward the beach, asked an old
man with a funny cackling laugh where moe hostels were located.  He
directed us to a police substation (HPD is Honolulu Police Department,
not Houston Police Department) where the cat called hostels for us and
found one available.  We were his last customers before he shut down
the shop.  Perfect timing.</p>

<p class=date>7:29am HST Sunday 9 February 2003</p>

<p>Last night when Janette and I went walking along Waikiki beach,
heading away from all the bustle toward what turned out to be a war
memorial with a no longer used salt water swimming pool (the largest
of its kind), I carried my computer and all my stuff except my hoodie
and shoes with me in my back pack.  Specifically my computer I wanted
to keep with me and not leave at the hostel, for I didn't trust my
shit to remain safe.</p>

<p>This after my yammer complaining about people having too much
stuff.  Is it okay for me to covet just my little bit of stuff?  To
hold dear one particular item, which really I'm not attached to the
computer; it's these journal entries I don't want to lose.  And to a
lesser degree my emails that I don't want to lose.  Everything else I
can replace.  Even my pile of MP3s doesn't crush my heart to imagine
losing them.  Half of them are copied from online</p>

<p>I intend/hope (not yet trust) that I'll feel more safe at the next
hostel on a less populated island.</p>

<p>I'm gonna try to upload these entries here in the internet cafe of
this hostel.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I entered some bills into WG and then paid one of the dollars for 5
minutes of internet access.  It's a dollar per 10 minutes.  I'll try
to negotiate.. oh wait, well there's a new person at the desk and they
are counting through till now to switch people at the desk.</p>

<p>Reenie's actual name is Maureen.  But she's Reenie from now on in
here.  She goes by Reen in the real world, but Janette calls her
Reenie.</p>

<p>Reenie wasn't allowed to bring scissors through the checkpoint, so
she <em>mailed</em> them back to herself at her house.  "But what if I
need to trim my <em>bangs</em>???  Is that such a terrible thing?  I'm
no terrorist; I just don't want to be a fashion disaster on Hawaii, of
course!"  I made that last sentence up, but she was saying some funny
shit like that.</p>
