<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>In a hotel type thing, and Will Robidee, the general
manager of KTRU was in charge of taking care of stuff.  I took an
elevator up, and couldn't find the button to go up, so I flipped a
little switch and it went up beyond the level of the roof.  I was
really scared that I might fall, but it didn't and I was able to get
it back down to the level of the roof.  I told Will what happened, and
he showed me how to fix it.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class=dream>I was back at work, or I had to bring something back to
work and the door was unlocked though I used a key to get in, like I
still had a key, and it appeared to work, but it only worked since the
door was already unlocked.</p>

<p class=dream>Got inside and remembered that I didn't work there
anymore.  Dave and Dennis came to see who was intruding, and were all,
"oh, it's Rob" and went about their business for a second before
coming to say HI.</p>

<p class=dream>I felt really sad during the dream.  Everyone was
dressed nicely and having fun, and there were some cute cute girls
that I had worked with at Telecheck there.  Some YRUUers were there as
well.  I wasn't willing to express my sadness there so I gave them the
peace out sign and left.</p>

<p class=dream>I wanted to get out as quickly as possible, but I took
the elevator too far down and had to climb up a flight of stairs to
get to the parking lot level.  I was opening crying and when I got
near my car I was going to kick a kickball in a venting anger type
way, but I chose not to at the last second and it just sorta bounced
away.</p>

<p>Bronwyn just called me!  She's the housemate with whom I connected
most completely while Bryn and I visited London in March.  Wow!  She's
in Connecticut now, and will be in Montana from 17-30 August!  I'm
looking into flight information so I can go see her for a few days
during that time.</p>

<p>The tickets seem rather expensive, but I trust that all will work
out for the highest good for all those involved.</p>

<p>Today I helped do dishes and got the water pump working (the one I
had given to Janette) and intend to shave off a bit of the door frame
so the back kitchen door won't stick anymore.</p>

<p>Janette and I went out to Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food for lunch.
Great stuff, similar calibre as La Jaliscience, but not as big of a
location.</p>

<p>I missed my 10am phone call with Kim Sawyer; he called me at 10:30
and we talked a bit about updating his website.</p>

<p>Rode my bike from Bibby's to downtown Dallas today.  Took the
feeder of 75 south into the city.  Rode around and through some water
fountains beneath the tall mirrored building that changes shape when
viewed from different directions.  Got trapped in the middle of the
square fountains, like a water jail.  Rode in circles a bit and then
the inner fountains started to spray so I rode out and almost hit a
soaking wet guy who had been in the fountain before and was on the
perimeter as I exited.</p>

<p>He was all, "woah" and I was all "sorry mate; I couldn't see you."
Nothing more; tragedy averted.</p>

<p>Cool thing next as I rode my bike up the multiple sets of 6
steps that led up to the street level.  I made it up all the sets
without putting my foot down except for the very last set I didn't
quite make it up.  So awesome!</p>

<p>Then rode to the three legged tower with a ball on top; it has a
Hilton hotel at the bottom.  Um, then to the Reunion Center parking
garage, rode up that and looked around the perimeter before riding
back down.  Saw some peeps up on Memorial near the convention center
over the DART rail lines (remember this is Dallas, not Houston) and I
rode up there to say HI.  The guy was talking to his girl, showing her
different things about the DART, and the huge sets of springs on top
of the columns holding up the convention center around the railroad
tracks, apparently designed to dampen vibrations!</p>

<p>Just (JUST!) as we were done and they were walking back to their
car, and I was hopping onto my bike, I saw a cop car coming down the
street.  I didn't hang around and coasted down the hill.  I could hear
the quuick <em>bluuroop</em> of the cop siren as he stopped behind
them.  I didn't stop and felt a bit bad about it.  If we had left just
10 seconds sooner, they would have been on their way before the cop
got there.  Amazing.</p>

<p>Then I rode under the convention center or next to it there's a
DART station and I rode around it a bit, and the train sounds reminded
me of London trains (not too surprising) and then I began the trek
home.</p>

<p>I was relatively sure which way would get me back to the Bibby's
and was thankful to be correct on my first try.  Thankful that I had
specifically looked for some marker buildings to guide me back.</p>

<p>My bike felt wobbly as I rode so I got off, but didn't find
anything wrong.  My imagination?  Later I discovered that my left
crank shaft was just about to fall off.  I tightened the bolt that
holds it on, but it didn't really last long.  Each time I tightened
it, it lasted less long until finally I just took the whole thing off
and used my bike as a scooter the rest of the way home.  I'm thankful
that I didn't lose the bolt that holds it on; that wouldn't cost too
much, but it's an expense I'm thankful not to have.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Got back to the Bibby's and Josephine and her mom and I went
swimming at their friends house while they are out of town.  Patrick
was house sitting the house and happily granted us permission even
though none of us had met him.  That was fun in a strange way.  He had
been informed by the owners that swimming guests were likely and
should be let in.</p>

<p>The dogs at the pool would bark unless we splashed water at them.
One dog would run away from splashes and the other would bite the
splashes, presumably catching water in its mouth.  Funny!</p>

<p>Now I'm in Denton chillin' with Marta.</p>

<p>Ryan, Joel, Aaron are playing guitar, drums, guitar respectively,
sorta serenading Mikey, who apparently requested a certain type of
song, so they just jammed on the chords A, B, C, D, E, F, G over and
over, then A, A-minor, B, B-minor, C, C-minor, D, D-minor, E, E-minor,
F, F-minor.  "That was the worst idea for a song ever."  "or the best
idea ever!"</p>

<p>Now they are playing 12 bars and 3 chords of blues.</p>

<p>Last night, although I didn't hear it when it happened, Jack was
apparently all, "hey ass suckers!  Here's 2 simple instructions for
you: Shut and Up!"  Jack wasn't trying to sleep, just trying to get
them quiet so others could sleep.  I wore earplugs and heard
nothing.</p>

<p>Later I'm going out to get a hub so we can connect multiple
computers to their DSL line.</p>

<p>Today after lunch, everyone left the house except Jo, Janette, and
me.  Joey then went to see Austin Powers 3 with Tara, and I helped
Janette clean the kitchen, tried to build a water fountain, drove to
Fry's to get a hub (actually need a router and it was deemed too
expensive) and then we went for a 2 mile walk along the lake.</p>

<p>Got home after Joey, who grounded us for not leaving a note and
then we ate dinner and watched <em>The Others</em>, a pretty good
movie about ghosts and such.</p>

<p>Bedtime now.</p>

<p>After Joey went to the movies, Janette and I lay in Janette's bed
and cuddled some.  Ultimately we did not do anything because I
wouldn't want Sean or Josephine to know.  If not for them, we probably
would have fucked like rabbits.</p>

<p class=date>3:14pm Monday 29 July 2002</p>

<p>We have caressed a bit; I've kissed her cheeks and forehead and
such.  No fluid exchanging kisses.  Just love and closeness.</p>

<p>Awake.  Unpacking and repacking my car to go visit the Bibby's for
a few days.  Ironically, Sean is in Utah now, so I can't hang out with
him exactly yet.</p>

<p class=date>4:52pm</p>

<p>Been chillin' with Janette, Sean and Joey's mom.  Joey just woke up
a bit ago.  Janette has been cooking all day ("20 hours" she says) and
I've helped a tiny bit by cutting parsley (I think) and jalepenos and
mixing tabouli.  We've been listening to some of my KTRU tapes.</p>

<p>I'm pretty hungry and tired right now.  I've just woken up after
sleeping since midnight or so.</p>

<p>We had a whole posse of youth at the bibby's last night: Aaron
Ryan, Meg Cusack, Ryan McCarthy, Jack Burens, all driven by Colleen
Crotty.  Then Mikey Arthrell, Joel Brazzel, and oops I think someone
else that I don't remember, all arrived at like 10 or 11pm.</p>

<p>Everyone-ish took a gander at all the <a
href="/images/journal/2002/07/swuusi">pics</a> I have from SWUUSI.  A bit
over 900, though many are taken in quick succession, so a lot will be
culled out.</p>

<p>Janette made tons of food; we chowed and it was all great.  I've
had a lovely time here.</p>

<p>I'm feeling a bit headachey - my sinuses have been reacting to what
seems to be much lower humidity here than Houston or Lake Murray.  I
took a generic Tavist last night.</p>

<p>Going back to bed now.</p>
