<p>Dug a hole for myself on the beach but it was too far from the waves
to bury me in the sand.  Headed down to the water a bit more and
meditated with Lin.  Kept moving down toward the water so I was in the
waves from 0 to 40cm deep, avg 2~10cm.  たのしかった</p>

<p>Got Godot app to highlight clicked items today and got it to highlight
subsequent mouseovered items and unswipe backtracked items.</p>

<p>Right now 8:00 at Lin&rsquo;s dad&rsquo;s restaurant calling her sisters and he
wants them to sell products in Japan and oldest sister is like False.</p>

<p>But the best news is for MT3.  Her dad gave me hundreds of ice cream
spoons of a shape I had never seen before.</p>

<p>Lin and I just walked along the beach from the restaurante de
churrascos (sp) after pretty much gorging on all the offerings.</p>

<p>I saw some really neat rivulets on the beach (but forgot to take a
picture) where water seems to just spring from the beach.  I guess
that is exactly what&rsquo;s happening; water within the sand works its way
out and then comes down to the ocean.</p>

<div class="dream">I had a schedule conflict that I detected a few
days out, but didn't try to rectify until the day of the conflict.
Nate wanted to have me join a late night adventure sneaking into a
dark house that only I knew the layout to find some prize close to
midnight.</div>

<div class="dream">I was more interested in joining Lin to meet Travis
and Yumi for a roadtrip that started at 11pm, but planned to meet in
nearly the same location, an empty field next to the building that
Nate and I were going to explore in the dark.</div>

<div class="dream">I was more interested in joining Lin and Travis
because they wanted me to join because of me, and Nate wanted me to
join because of what I could do.</div>

<div class="dream">I decided I had to call Nate, so I found my phone
and my earphones and plugged them into the phone and into my ears.  I
called him while walking around a mall near a train station, going up
and down escalators and was like</div>

<div class="dream">"Hey yo I gotta leave early tonight like
midnight,"</div>

<div class="dream">and he goes "Why?"</div>

<div class="dream"> Which is a question I had not really anticipated.
I told him why and he seemed to understand because he repeated back
what I said.  I was like yep and he started to negotiate as I walked
down an escalator barefoot and turned right after I saw some people go
down a vertical elevator thing like in a parking garage I saw where
the staff could use the elevator chains that just continuously cycled.
I was surprised that I didnt want to take that but instead took the
escalator, thinking next time I would take the elevator chain.</div>

<p>I woke up quite relieved that there was no schedule conflict..</p>

<p>Great view of semi-fragile sand dunes, but not safe to climb ざんねん.
Hot girls including one with braces.  OMG why do so many adults have
braces here?</p>

<p>Finished algorithm for the app (LeSwipe / ConSwi) to deal with linking
swipes to shapes while chilling in a self made hole in the beach.</p>

<p>(pictures coming soon?)</p>

<p>Quite interesting to see the waves coming in over the very-flat beach,
so it came up significantly farther and farther with each passing unit
of time.  There was a bridge from the steps to the shore but even it
did not stay dry at high tide.</p>

<p>Before taking video of kids leaping from the restaurant balcony into
high tide, I took several pics of the water coming in, which I hope to
make into an animation.</p>

<h2 id="22-18pm">22:18pm</h2>

<p>wow so much to see in Brazil!</p>

<p>Played table football with Artulio(sp) as sister whined or watched
videos.  He never cared that I never understood, and he never tried to
understand when I spoke verbally.</p>

<p>At the end I threw a peace sign and he gently corrected me with throat
slit pantomime.  I guess it is serious bzns.</p>

<p>I am making a swipe game which requires the user to swipe specific shapes.</p>

<pre><code>XX
XX
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>XXXX
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>X
X
X
X
</code></pre>

<p>excetera (haha)</p>

<p>I will have a list of tile coordinates which were swiped.</p>

<pre><code>(3,3)
(3,4)
(3,5)
(3,6)
</code></pre>

<p>Above coordinates would match the horizontal XXXX (or is it vertical? Anyway,)</p>

<p>I can imagine comparing the above list to a list calculated from</p>

<pre><code>f((3,3))
</code></pre>

<p>which would return the same list of coordinates by adding (0,0) (0,1) (0,1) (0,1)</p>

<p>But that is error prone beyond my tolerance. (Esp given that it needs to work both directions, or in eight (8)! directions for the square shape)</p>

<p>I would like to just give a list of acceptable shapes as ASCII art like my XXXX above and let code do the rest.</p>

<p>What would this kinda algorithm be called?  Is it easiest to just grok
A* path finding or is that overkill?</p>

<h2 id="18-44-thursday-21-december-2017-03">18:44 Thursday 21 December 2017 -03</h2>

<p>I figured out an algorithm in four parts:</p>

<pre><code>1) Parse
2) Sort
3) Diff
4) Compare
</code></pre>

<p>Parse is optional, and is used to process my definitions in a shape library:</p>

<pre><code>Library = {Square: [
0,0,0,0,
0,1,1,0,
0,1,1,0
0,0,0,0
],

Tee: [
1,1,1,0,
0,1,0,0,
0,1,0,0,
0,0,0,0
]}
</code></pre>

<p>However, the above (1) wastes space, and (2) is limited to 4x4 shapes.</p>

<p>So, add one more digit to tell the parser when to flip to the next line (increment y)</p>

<p>Then we have:</p>

<pre><code>Library = {Square: [2,
1,1,
1,1
],

Tee: [3,
1,1,1,
0,1,0,
0,1,0
],

Vert5: [1,
1,1,1,1,1],

Horiz5: [5,
1,1,1,1,1]}
</code></pre>

<p>Parse algorithm is annoying to type out well, but it basically poops out an array of Vector2s</p>

<p>Parse(Square) results in</p>

<pre><code>[(1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(2,2)]
</code></pre>

<p>in the first Library above, and</p>

<pre><code>[(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1)]
</code></pre>

<p>in the second Library above.</p>

<p>Having different definitions for the same shape won&rsquo;t work, so we Sort the Vector2s (actually they are sorted above) and Diff them:</p>

<p>Define Diff as</p>

<pre><code>Array[(0,0),
Next-Current for each adjacent pair]
</code></pre>

<p>Bingo, consistent definitions for same shapes, no matter what shape or where in the grid they are defined.</p>

<pre><code>Diff(Sort(Parse (Square)))
</code></pre>

<p>is always</p>

<pre><code>[(0,0),(0,1),(1,-1),(0,1)]
</code></pre>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t done Tee yet, but</p>

<pre><code>Diff(Sort(Parse([4,
0,1,1,0,
0,1,0,1,
0,1,1,1])))
</code></pre>

<p>is always</p>

<pre><code>[(0,0),(0,1),(0,1),(1,-2),(0,2),(1,-1)(0,1)]
</code></pre>

<p>On the game grid, swiping a square results in an array of Vector2s which can be processed starting with Sort above and get the same Diff output.</p>

<p>Yay</p>

<p>Relaxing on the beach, we got some delicious drinks: <em>manga con leche</em>
(sp) for me and acerola for Lin.  Mine was sweeet and <em>muito
deliciouso</em> (sp).</p>

<p>A man came by with a young boy in his arms, and we ended up giving him
R10 $3. Then other guys selling shirts, cashews, art, and maybe one
more before we ended up just leaving instead of saying no no no no.</p>

<p>Here is Brazil, cashew fruit are available at any fruit stand.</p>

<p>I tried the fruit.  So much water spilling out I think it should be
called watermelon.  Very stringy and not so delicious, but edible.</p>

<p>Once I finished the fruit, I looked at the stem looking thing.</p>

<p>Wait, so you&rsquo;re telling me there&rsquo;s a cashew nut in here?  That&rsquo;s
awesome!</p>

<p>It was too hard to crack with my fingers, so I used my teeth to try to
crack it open.  It was actually chewy, not hard, so I bit it again a
couple of times to try to get it to open.</p>

<p>Eww hang on, that tastes bitter.  Yo wow ow holy cats it&rsquo;s terrible
flavor.</p>

<p>I felt a tiny bit woozy walking to the bar to find something to wash
down the flavor.  Was it poisonous??</p>

<p>Here is what I wrote to myself:</p>

<h2 id="08-20">08:20</h2>

<pre><code>Note to self

Do not chew cashew nut case to get the cashew out

Worst taste ever

I have consumed
Two pieces of cake
One cup of yogurt
One glass of orange juice

And I can still taste the cashew shell flavor
</code></pre>

<h2 id="08-36">08:36</h2>

<pre><code>Cup of yogurt, cup of porridge, and 15 minutes later, I can still
taste it. It kinda feels like it damaged my tongue like a burn (acid)?
</code></pre>

<h2 id="08-41">08:41</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cashew#Cashew_nut_and_shell">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cashew#Cashew_nut_and_shell</a></p>

<pre><code>The shell of the cashew nut contains oil compounds which may cause
contact dermatitis similar in severity to that of poison ivy,
primarily resulting from the phenolic lipids, anacardic acid, and
cardanol. Due to the possible dermatitis, cashews are typically
not sold in the shell to consumers.

<p>En route to GRU via taxi from Rodrigo&rsquo;s aparment.  I trust we are on
time; our flight is at 12:45pm and the airport is apparently 14
kilometers from here.  Traffic has started moving briskly; we are
traveling at 80 km/h, so we should ostensibly arrive in less than 14
minutes, so I guess we are good.  It&rsquo;s a domestic flight so maybe less
stringent through security.</p>

<p>Now traveling 120 km/h so I am sure we will be fine.</p>

<p>We made it to the gate right at boarding time.  The taxi ride to the
airport was fine, but then we had to wait in line for 30 minutes to
pay extra for a big bag full of presents and stuff.</p>

<p>I finished what I&rsquo;m calling v0.0.1.X of my Godot game.  Now the pieces
fall via gravity, can be moved via keypress, and can be dropped
quickly to the bottom of the screen..</p>
