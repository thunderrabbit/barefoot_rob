<p>Driving to Ohio now.  I've been driving for a bit.  Like 60 miles
or so.  Just stopped at BP Amoco for $1.489/gallon gas.</p>

<p>1915 miles since dallas.  Next on the list of funny place names:
Uranium Enrichment Plant</p>

<p class=date>8:22pm</p>

<p>Now I have arrived in Ohio.  So thankful for the most excellentness
of everyone to put me up on such short notice.  I'm really thankful
for that.</p>

<p class=date>9:04pm</p>

<p>We just watched the last bit of Fear Factor.  What a silly show.
Now Katy is watching Everybody Loves Raymond.</p>

<p>Just saw a commercial for Survivor, which reminds me of a
prediction made by Joe McMoneagle, that suggested the survivor shows
will eventually become long adventures that include business
negotiations, cultural immersions, geographical challenges, etc.</p>

<p class=date>10:38pm</p>

<p>Wowzers.  Very interesting the emotions that come up in this
scenario.  I've just dropped in on my aunt and step uncle with one
day's notice and they really wanted to be super accomodating.  I
certainly don't want to have *not* seen them, but I also just wanted
to see them and not get super royal treatment.  I finally had to just
say "go to bed" to Madeleine as she was showing me the food in the
refrigerator.  "If none of it is off limits, then I can just wing it
in the morning."</p>

<p>Katy and David had to go to bed and be up early, so I hugged them
bye; I won't see them tomorrow.  Actually I just hugged Katy.  The
twins had already gone to bed.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>These guys are so awesome for giving me a warm bed on such short
notice.</p>

<p>The plan for tomorrow is to see my cousin Pete for lunch, and then
for me to head on to my next stop, Oberlin.</p>

<p>It's been a week now since I've been internet connected with this
computer.</p>

<p class=date>10:44pm</p>

<p>The floors in this house are <em>very squeaky</em>.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>

<p>Barbie is so beautiful.  Too bad she smokes and is my cousin, but I
just really think she's hot.</p>

<p>She's an awesome mom for Sarah and Shane, and is super success
oriented in her career.  She's working on buying a magazine (and I
ain't talking about buying 1 issue of a magazine) and has done lots of
other stuff, but I don't know what yet until we get a real chance to
talk!</p>

<p class=date>6:11pm</p>

<p>At this moment, Keely and Sarah and Bevin have come over to visit,
further interrupting Barbie, but they are about to split and go
fishing; they were just checking in with Barbie.</p>

<p>Sarah is in a super great mood; she loves playing with Keely.</p>

<p>Interesting that Barbie likes to have Sarah dressed nicely even
when she (Sarah) is about to go fishing.</p>

<p class=date>8:04pm</p>

<p>Barbie and I have finally gotten to talk.  We walked around her
neighborhood; there is a circular road that basically wraps around
most of the houses and holes in the golf course.  Showed me the
riverfront lot she purchased, the last buildable lot in Barboursville
which she apparently got for a good price.</p>

<p>Exchanged relationship stories of both of our misadventures in
sex/romance.  whoopie.</p>

<p>Told her a bit about my love of youth advising, and my final two
planned rallies before I go.  How Bryn told me if I let YRUU keep me
from exploring the world, then that's what I'll be teaching the youth:
let something great hold me back from the world.</p>

<p>We waved to three people walking by and I noticed it was Jason's
mom and two of her kids.  "HI Jason's mom!" and me-an-Barbie's
conversation was interrupted while they talked neighbor stuff and work
stuff.  They have both worked in radio before. (behind the scenes)</p>

<p>Barbie and I will probably chat again soon.</p>

<p class=date>1:06am</p>

<p>Chatted with Barbie, shared a bit more about relationship stuff and
my love of beautiful Sally.  Barbie and I seem to share a tendency to
fall in love with people pretty quickly (and usually fall out of love
pretty quickly too.)</p>

<p>Cordie made breakfast this morning of eggs, toast, sausage, gravy.
Good stuff even though she kept saying it would be better if she had
had milk.</p>

<p class=date>5:56pm</p>

<p>After walking with Sarah for an hour or more, she really needed a
drink of water, but wasn't willing to come home to get it.  I couldn't
really find the real reason why.  Closest I got was that she wasn't
able to have any friends over.  I'm not sure why though.</p>

<p>I basically dropped Sarah off at Keely, Bevin & Jeff's house.  They
were glad to watch her; she keeps Keely pretty well entertained and
vice versa.</p>

<p>Pregnant Bevin offered me brownie and ice cream, and hot dogs +
broccoli for Sarah.  Excellent.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Back to the house I almost got to chat with Barbie, but she kept
getting interrupted and I fell asleep.  She fell asleep as soon as I
woke up, but I got to chat with Cordie s'more.</p>

<p>Cordie inquired about my plans and such, and told me a fraction
about her life, basically that she wants to start an exercise routine
(walking consistently) and might possibly want to teach illiterate
types how to read now that Cordie's mom (my dad's grandmother) Granny
has died and Cordie is no longer taking care of her.</p>

<p>The family is still taking care of estate BS after the death and
that's taking a lot of time and energy from people, and explains why
Barbie and Cordie were unable to come here for so many days after I
got here.</p>

<p>Cordie explained how she still feels anger toward the Japanese for
Pearl Harbor (she was 18 years old) and wishes me well on my
adventure, but is simply aware of how times have changed.  She
wondered if I had been taught a lot of history, and I said yes it had
been presented to me, but that I didn't really learn it.</p>

<p>During <em>The Fast and The Furious</em>, which we watched after
<em>Silence of the Lambs</em> on Showtime (?), Sally called me!</p>

<p>"Sally?" after I saw the phone number on their caller ID.  Totally
jumped up to run outside and talk with her.  I'm so in love.</p>

<p>Told her that my second stop from now will be Oberlin and she
totally shared all these cool stories of peeps and places and co-ops
and everything awesome up there since she went to Oberlin for graduate
school I think. (that was when I barely knew her)</p>

<p>Wow!  I had totally forgotten she had been there and was thrilled
to get all this inside information.  I will write her a letter from
the campus and send it to her.  That reminds me that I never finished
my letter to Bryn that I started in OKC.  Silly Rob.</p>

<p>I have only sent one (1) letter since I've been on my adventure,
and that was to Marta cause I owed her some money.</p>

<p>Sally is going to Cuba from 3-13 November to experience the Havanah
Drum Festival, which will certainly be totally unbelievably awesomely
excellent.  I greatly look forward to hearing those stories!</p>

<p>At the end of the conversation, cut short only because she had to
go drop off a friend at LAX, I told her I really look forward to the
opportunity to date her.  I really want to know if we could spend a
lot lot lot lot lot of time together in the future.  Sally is so
awesome!</p>

<p>Watched a few minutes of Space Ghost on Adult Swim on Cartoon
Network since Edward Lerner seems pretty entertained by it.  I wanted
to check out what I was missing.  I can see where he would think it's
funny.  There was one good line on there, but I forgot it.</p>

<p>Barbie's going to wake me up in the morning and we may go for a
walk, or more specifically Barbie may join Elizabeth and I for a walk,
although I'd like to be sure that I get my car to Jiffy Lube to get
the oil changed and do a transmission fluid exchange before I begin
the next part of my adventure.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>

<p>I have determined that my throat is sore and scratchy not because
I'm sick with a virus, but because my nose is snotting and draining
down my throat due to the cigarette smoke in this house.  Becky smokes
a lot.  Like she's smoking as often as not, possibly including when
she's sleeping.  Okay, maybe not, but maybe so.</p>

<p>I find it annoying at first, and disgusting after a while.  I'm
like holy shit, when are you going to stop smoking???</p>

<p>I've been reading Japanese today.  If Barbie doesn't make it to her
today, then I'll probably leave tomorrow.</p>

<p>Sarah and I embarked on a walk pretty much as soon as she woke up
around 9 or 10am.  I had just cooked a pizza, so I folded it in half
and we both ate on it like a pizza sandwich while walking down the
golf course.  Discovered Jeff on the course; actually he saw Sarah
first and she gave him a big o' hug and Jeff and I just started
talking.</p>

<p>I helped him hang a shelf in the garage, helped him and his wife
Bevin bring in groceries when she got home, helped watch Sarah and
Keely (22 months old) play in the yard.  Sarah attached a shoulder
strap to her shirt and had Keely lead her around like a dog.
Seriously.  It was quite cute.</p>

<p>Keely fed the fish (two little resilient striped fish above the
kitchen sink) and then fed them a teaspoon of cinnamon and sugar.
Bevin was all, "yikes stripes!" (actually that's Wende's phrase, but
it fits the situation exactly) and I took a picture with their camera
to capture a moment from The Day Keely Poured Cinnamon and Sugar Into
The Fish Bowl.  Hahahaha funny.</p>

<p>We ate lunch then ice cream in cones.  Jeff cleaned up the garage
and expressed his thanks that I had helped him get started; he had
been wanting to do that for months.  Totally absolutely fantastic and
my pleasure to be helpful.</p>

                        <p class=date>2:52pm EDT Saturday 5 October 2002</p>

<p>Been chatting it up with Elizabeth, who I still think is a pretty
cool pretty cute girl.  Been talking about her major and about travel
and about languages.  She knows some French and has known some
German.</p>

<p>I asked, "you wanna go walk around in the woods?"  "Are we going to
get dirty?"  "Hopefully!"  So we're going to go romp around in the
woods now.</p>

<p class=date>6:44pm</p>

<p>Had an utterly fantastic romp through the woods with Elizabeth!  We
started easily at first, and then quickly decided if we're going to do
this right, we gotta cross the river.</p>

<p>It wasn't as deep as I had feared it might be; my shorts barely got
wet.  4 wheel drive up the ravine and then through the beautiful
forest to discover an ugly scar that Elizabeth wondered if it might be
a dam.  I didn't think so; what water would it dam up?</p>

<p>Up up up up up a steep incline until we reached the ridge of the
mountain.  A couple hundred feet elevation above the river as we
reached the tip top of the mountain overlooking the golf course and
neighborhood.  Too many trees to see more than glimpses of one house
at a time.</p>

<p>I found a small tree growing right next to a big tree without low
branches.  I blessed the trees and asked if I could climb them.
Positive answer, so I used the small tree to reach the big tree's
lowest branch.  Up Up Up up up up up up up up up until the trunk of
the big tree was almost as small as the small tree.  Totally awesome.
I don't really have a way to determine how high I climbed, but I'm
guessing 100 feet.</p>

<p>Down the tree, then gave it a hug.  Down the ridge the other
direction from wence we came.  Saw beautiful forest, so quiet so full
of life and chipmunks and a woodpecker as we sat quietly on a spongey
log fallen across the ravine.</p>

<p>Trekked down down the ravine until we found another scar in the
land, including fallen trees, including a hunter's platform which he
had thoroughly bolted to the tree with 4x4s.  Tree was cut, down came
the hunter's roost.  Ironic to think, "oh those squirrels lost their
home, but that poor hunter lost his roost."</p>

<p>Elizabeth asked, "I wonder what's on the other side of that dirt
right there?"</p>

<p>"I can think of 2 ways to find out:  1 is to go over there, 2 is to
send you over there and you tell me what you see, 3 is for us to send
a letter to that house [beyond the dirt] and ask them what they see
from their house."</p>

<p>Turned out to be a house under construction, with a curious base.
Basically it looked like a cinderblock wall 3 feet tall around the
whole perimeter, but the dirt underneath hadn't been smoothed or
anything.  2x12s had been put on the cinderblocks to make the floor,
so there was no way to really fix the floor further.  Plus, it
couldn't really have been specifically insulating dead air space
because there was a crawlway into it from the garage.  Okay the garage
could have been partially insulated, but still weird.</p>

<p>Asked a neighbor where we were, and Elizabeth understood, but I did
not.  Told him where we had been, etc.</p>

<p class=date>7:05pm</p>

<p>(Barbie has just arrived.)</p>

<p>(Oooh I love her short hair!)</p>

<p>Okay, quick.. Back up the hill, but I loved that Elizabeth was all,
"let's go a different way back!" and loved how exploratious she was
willing to be.  That way back proved to be easier and we saw a deer in
a field on top of a hill.  Beautiful field with a beautiful mountain
range visible beyond it.  Sun setting behind us to the left lit the
whole thing fabulously.  And there was a table with two white plastic
chairs stacked nearby.</p>

<p>Tromped down the hill and a guy was bulldozing at the first scar we
saw.  Turns out Elizabeth was right; he's making a dam to make a lake.
Paul Adams was his name.  It was mostly all his land and this is a
project he has been wanting to do for a while.  Good for him.  I hope
it's all a beautiful thing for the world and not some horrible
commercialized bullshit thing.</p>

<p>Chatted with him a bit and Elizabeth left leaving a bit wary of his
skillz at building a dam.  What if it collapsed and flooded the area
below?  It was supposed to be a couple of acres.  I just don't
know.</p>

<p>Down through brambles I went and Elizabeth found an easier way.
Then down to the river almost exactly where we had crossed before, but
this time was significantly deeper.  My stomach got wet.  She
basically dove in without getting her head under.  Back to the house
and Becky was all, "IF YOU GET THIS HOUSE DIRTY AFTER I JUST
CLEANED IT....." and I just laughed and ran inside to the kitchen and
then to the bathroom.  Didn't get it too dirty.  All is good.</p>

<p>Oh, one thing I really liked is that she wore her silver bracelets
and choker necklace during our adventure.  Nice.</p>
