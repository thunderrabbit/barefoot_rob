                        <p>##11:37am Sunday 2 November 2014##</p>

<p>Got off the train, felt no cellphone in my front pocket!</p>

<p>Crap!</p>

<p>I turned around and (stupidly) started <em>angling</em> back toward the train
door where we had gotten off, instead of straight back to the train
and got on before the doors closed.</p>

<p>D&rsquo;oh!</p>

<p>Went to the lost and found to report it.  I was like, &ldquo;so where does
that train stop?&rdquo; thinking they could look up that the train that left
at 11:37am and know when and where it was scheduled to stop for the
day (probably 大崎).  He was like, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a circle, mate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>True enough.</p>

<p>##13:00##</p>

<p>At Paola&rsquo;s house and called Softbank to ask them what to do.  The
rep was like, &ldquo;do you want us to track it?&rdquo;  Sure!  &ldquo;Okay, we&rsquo;ll call
you back in an hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Great!</p>

<p>##14:00##</p>

<p>It took the better part of an hour, but Softbank called back and said
it&rsquo;s in Shinjuku Okubo 2 Chome, or around thereabouts.  I asked if the
phone is moving or if it&rsquo;s been stopped there for a while.</p>

<p>She was like, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t know, but when we called it, it was in Shinjuku Okubo 2 Chome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(There goes my fantasy that they have giant maps with blinking lights
tracking phones around the city..)</p>

<p>So I go, &ldquo;okay, can you call it back and see if it&rsquo;s still there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We turned it off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there any way to turn it back on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in Shinjuku Okubo 2 Chome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&rdquo; &hellip; &hellip; &hellip; &hellip; &hellip; ? Umm, okay thank you very much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>wut.</p>

<p>##14:14##</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re going to walk to the local police box to ask them to be on the lookout.</p>

<p>ELI5 why the fuck would Softbank turn it off?</p>

<p>&ldquo;so no one can make calls (can cost you a lot of money)&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just don&rsquo;t charge me for the calls after I report it lost.</p>

<p>##15:something##</p>

<p>The guy at the police box was 元気 (happy/funny/helpful) and was
confident I&rsquo;d get the phone back, though it might take some time.</p>

<p>##19:55##</p>

<p>After a lovely afternoon at Paola&rsquo;s, featuring home made Indian
cuisine, Lin and I <em>walked</em> to Shibuya station from Paola&rsquo;s house,
which took about 30 minutes, and brought us past Lin&rsquo;s old high school
and lots of other places she hadn&rsquo;t seen in several years.</p>

<p>Near 道玄坂 we saw some young men walking and brushing their teeth at
the same time.  Not sure what that was about, but I&rsquo;m sure it was
either funny or cool.</p>

<p>Lin and I hopped on Yamanote Line and I commented that it was also on
Yamanote platform in Shibuya that I lost Francois some years ago.</p>

<p>We skipped one train because it only stopped in 大崎.</p>

<p>We got on the next train, and Lin got a call just as we arrived in 大崎.
&ldquo;Did you lose a phone?&rdquo;, etc.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s in 新大久保, so we&rsquo;re headed back now.</p>

<p>Now, I put &ldquo;walked&rdquo; in italics above because if we had taken the train
to Shibuya, we would have probably already been walking toward home in
川崎 (you can read that, right, Colleen?) which would have made it
more moe joe to go pick up the phone tonight.  Even if we had gotten
onto a train all the way to 品川 when we skipped that one train, we
might have been &ldquo;too far&rdquo; away to go back tonight.</p>

<p>Mutsumi invited Lin and I to eat with her and hubby and nephew and
friends Bruno and Sachiko at a Taiwanese restaurant near their
house. I was enthralled as Lin spoke Mandarin with the proprietor for
a bit. So cool!</p>

<p>I was inspired to learn Japanese a bit more than before.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve installed Prelude Emacs, hoping that it will support my desire to
easily embed images in my journal entries.  To insert an image, I need to insert soemthing like this:</p>

<pre><code>![alt text](/path/to/image.png)
</code></pre>

<p>The idea is that I type some keys, in this case <code>C-x !</code> and I
interactively am asked for the alt text and then can quickly get a
list of images based on the year/month of my current journal entry, in
this case <sup>2014</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub>.</p>

<p>Based on <a href="https://gist.github.com/thunderrabbit/453c1e1c4a959f113d10">hakyll.el</a>, I got the first part sorted:</p>

<pre><code>(defun hakyll-insert-image (alt-text)
  &quot;Insert an image from /images/yyyy/mm to current buffer /posts/yyyy/mm/dd/....md&quot;
  (interactive &quot;sAltText: &quot;)
  (let ((current-buffer-filename (buffer-file-name)))
    (insert
     (format &quot;![%s](%s)&quot;
         alt-text
         current-buffer-filename
         ))
    )
  )
</code></pre>

<p>So instead of inserting the current buffer filename, I want to parse
the current buffer filename for <code>yyyy/mm</code> and then select a file
from <code>~/journal/images/yyyy/mm</code> and insert (part of) <em>its</em> name instead.</p>

<p>I made a <a href="https://trello.com/b/ZsZU8NFz/hakyll-robnugen-com">Trello list of things I want to do on this journal</a></p>

<p>I spent a few hours working on the 3D maze I started about a week ago.  There must be a faster way, but I don&rsquo;t know how exactly.  Basically for each part of the maze that goes over another part, I make that section its own layer so it can be &ldquo;above&rdquo; the lower layers.  Then for each part that goes under another party, I make that its own section so it can be &ldquo;below&rdquo; the upper layers.  But then, to paint a gradient on the lower sections, I have to split them apart again because I don&rsquo;t know how to make Gimp do a &ldquo;double&rdquo; gradient.  I don&rsquo;t even know what it&rsquo;s called (as I haven&rsquo;t tried to look it up).</p>

<p>I might remember to see if Gimp can do it before I finish this maze.  Here it is so far:</p>

<p>Got an email from Travis today indicating that he refactored my Hakyll installation.  Whoohoo!!</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/TravisCardwell/hakyll-journal/commits/73c097622380ed70f30bcf51306c25c41d25fd92">refactorization he&rsquo;s done so far is visible here</a>.</p>

<p>The biggest changes (in terms of me not understanding them well) are in one file.  <a href="https://github.com/TravisCardwell/hakyll-journal/commit/05416e71fbbf0f910bcc19717ee88d7ae810c9bd">https://github.com/TravisCardwell/hakyll-journal/commit/05416e71fbbf0f910bcc19717ee88d7ae810c9bd</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to put all his changes into the &lsquo;master&rsquo; branch, merge them into my recently created &lsquo;rob&rsquo; branch, then replace my personalized content in master with some generic stuff so it&rsquo;s easier for people to use this repo for their own Hakyll installations.</p>

<p>Travis helped me (into and) out of Cabal Hell on my mac. heehee</p>

<pre><code>cd ~
rm -rf .ghc
rm -rf .cabal
rm -rf ~/Library/Haskell
cabal update
cabal install cabal-install
</code></pre>

<p>Building cabal took a few minutes, even on my SSD-filled MBP. bah.</p>

<pre><code>mkdir journal
cd journal
cabal sandbox init
</code></pre>

<p>Now need to create <code>journal.cabal</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code>name:           journal
version:        0.1.0.0
build-type:     Simple
cabal-version:  &gt;=1.10

executable site
    main-is:            site.hs
    build-depends:      base == 4.*
                      , hakyll == 4.5.*
                      , filepath &gt;= 1.3
                      , tagsoup &gt;= 0.13
    ghc-options:        -Wall -O2 -threaded
    default-language:   Haskell2010
</code></pre>

<pre><code>cabal install --only-dependencies
</code></pre>

<p>Installing on the dependencies took about 20 minutes.  (?)</p>

<p>After <code>cabal install --only-dependencies</code> finishes, we build the journal (which uses Hakyll)</p>

<pre><code>cabal install
</code></pre>

<p>And now I can remove site, site.o etc from <code>.gitignore</code>, and just add dist/.  <code>.gitignore</code> now looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>_cache/
_darcs/
_site/
dist/
.cabal-sandbox/
</code></pre>

<p>Now I can compile my site from anywheres.  :-)  Thanks, Travis!!!</p>

<p>Went to Tariq&rsquo;s tonight to try getting progress on uploading an app
using Testflight just so we can test it during development.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2014/10/here-is-A.-A-does-not-exist.png" alt="That app name doesn't exist, and yet it does." /></p>

<p>And today, I couldn&rsquo;t even get that far.</p>

<p>Wow!</p>

<p>I got a call from Apple today.  Harumi explained that I need to create
the app in itunesconnect in order to deploy it over TestFlight.  This
is different than before Apple bought TestFlight.</p>

<p>Fortunately, and unfortunately-pleasantly-surprisingly, I do <em>NOT</em>
have to give a bunch of meta data for the app before deploying it via
TestFlight.  Just App Name, Bundle ID, SKU, and maybe one other thing
so trivial I don&rsquo;t remember it.</p>
