<p>Chillin' by Sean in the sponge room now.  We just looked through Vessy's pics from SWUUSI.  They are *SO* good.  Not just the pics, but they are all perfectly labeled.  Every person in every picture is named.  That is such aluable dedication now that will be so appreciated forever to come.</p>

<p>Sean is signing it now; I will in a second.</p>

<p class=message>AJ's hood is gone. here is the story....
so AJ is on the highway doin maybe 75 in a 70 right? ok well this jerk behind him desides to ride his ass really hard. and he's goin pretty fast. he is speeding put to like 80 at some points.  hmmm...so AJ has to speed up right? right, but there is a grey van ahead of him doin 60 so that isn't an option. but then the car behind him drops back and changes lanes, but he is still close. so AJ is thinkin he'll pass the grey van and him....but no. hmm ok. 'i'm sick of this' he's gonna dart ahead of the car behind him and speed past the van leaing the whole mess in his wake. so he gets in the left lane. when SNAP-CRACKLE-POP!! his HOOD flies up over the window and bend so that it is formfitting the car's profile. there is one small triangle of a peephole  in the bottom driverside windshield that he can look out of!  so he's goin 80 trying to get out of this asshole's way and he can't see for shit. thank god he's not dead. really. he pulls over on the sholder and has to rip it off. rip rip rip.. ok it comes off!! Rob and I and some others were like 'what did you do?? '</p>

<p>'i threw it into the median and stomped the shit out of it!!' haha he threw it in the median (where it is no longer) and jumped on it. well do you blame him?? think of the adrenilne. he said that he put his arm up to shield his face from the glass but it didn't break. thank yaweh.</p>

<p>We are still at Zilk Park.</p>

<p class=message>Short Term Memory (Sean has to remember this)</p>

<p>Sean put his white touch group bracelet on his cup.  At first glance (for some people) it looks like a big cup stuck inside a small cup.</p>

<p>Two minutes later he tried to pull the big cup out of the small cup.  "Hey, what happened to my cup?"</p>

<p>I thought he was trying to trick me.  "False.  It's your bracelet, silly."</p>

<p>"Ohhhh!!"</p>

<p>We took turns trying to trick different people.  "Try to pull the big cup out.  It's stuck."</p>

<p>About a third would try and a third would be suspicious and then try.  Others  were too suspicious to try.  A couple people took the whole thing and tried to pull them apart.</p>

<p>Danny took one look at it.  "It's a bracelet."  Nice.</p>

<p class=date>Bonk</p>

<p>After Sean and I totally schooled all the low rope course games, we tried a new variation of the walking two by fours.  Basically we were using them as long snowshoes.  We each held a rope to lift them as we lifted our feet.  But the cool variation was that we were beside each other, with our adjacent legs crossing, sorta like a 3 legged race.</p>

<p>Be sure to get that visual; these represent our legs as we are standing:</p>

<pre>
  /\  /\
 /  \/  \
/   /\   \
</pre>

<p>I directed our motion. "Okay, inside legs," and we moved both our inside legs forward.</p>

<p>"Okay, outside legs," and we both shifted our weight to our inside legs and <b>[bonk!!]</b> we knocked our heads together.   "Ow fuck!!!" and fell off the boards in pain and laughter.  Ow ow ow.</p>

<p>It's been at least 15 minutes and my head still has a lump and it hurts.</p>

<p>(It's been 36 hours and my head hurts there if I press on it)</p>

<p>I don't know what the fuck is going on exactly, but there are some rumors that Tulsa adults are "monitoring" this rally to determine if the Tulsa  Adults want the Tulsa Youth to attend any more district level events.  That is a rumor.</p>

<p>For some reason, we advisors have been asked to attend a lunch thing and let me tell you it is a fucking disgrace as I first lay eyes on this.  fucking <em>plates</em> fucking silver ware and a fucking table cloth and glasses and a fucking gift bag in each seat.
Not knowing WTF is going on, I'm immediately assuming these gifts are for us advisors.  I'm pissed.  I feel bribed.</p>

<p>The meeting hasn't even started yet, and the youth are down in the cafeteria eating sloppy lasagna on paper plates and they are looking up at us on the balcony going, "why are you up there?"  "are you better than us?"  They are asking in jest, but behind each joke is a bit of truth.</p>

<p>What The Fuck is going on??</p>

<p>I don't want to meet these people who have set up the lunch.  I want to tell them, you all are a bunch of idiots. This is not youth empowerment.  This is a tragedy to YRUU.</p> 

<p>These youth are precious fabulous people who are simply learning their place and way and means in life.  The rally is a sacred event that allows them to bond and interact and communicate and learn and create and without them I would not be 1 inch involved in UUism.  Really.  Really.</p>

<p>meeting now begins.</p>

<p class=date>2:15 pm</p>

<p>I left the meeting, which was not actually even a meeting, but just a condoned exclusive adisor lunch thing.  We were invited to introduce ourselves and tell how many youth we brought.  I went approximately last, and said, "the best thing about those 3 vans and those 18 youth coming was that the youth organized the whole thing.  The youth got the vans; the youth figured out how many people needed to go; the youth got drivers.  The youth are empowered and capable of doing amazing things."</p>

<p>There was no 'agenda' in the meeting, so I left and played disc with Sean.</p>

<p>We are in a fishbowl now; non Tulsa peeps talking, expressing our concerns.</p>

<p>In the fishbowl, I said as clearly and gently as possible, "I felt sad and pulled away from the community during the lunch.  Like it was condoned exclusive behavior.  I'm here for the youth.  I'm not here for the adults; I basically don't talk to the adults."</p>

<p>Chris says, "I have 189 youth on my list; I want my youth to attend the rallies.  There's no reason that I can't have 90 youth at rallies.  ...  Our problem is that we're not providing anything meaningful to them.   When I look at it as something new to them; 98% of what happens here is meaningful and powerful, but it gets pulled down by what the other 182 kids I've got find offensive.</p>

<p>"I want to speak with the youth who are not here; to see how we can bring them back."</p>

<p>Tanner: "You can't achieve your spirituality by crushing someone else's."  and "This is a church." and "This is a community and we need to respect the community."</p>

<p>Chris: "Each church has its own values; we're asking you to respect our church's values.   This has been a fantastic crowning success because we are having this discussion now.  So we can have the conversation that asks 'are we doing what is buildng our collective ministry.'"</p>

<p class=date>2:45 pm</p>

<p>Outside youth are now commending the Tulsa group on great rally, but wonder about when the repression will stop.</p>

<p>Ian: "I haven't been going around sying the fuck-word."</p>

<p>Steve Feinstein rules.  He <em>proved</em> in one quick zing that adults have Adult Power just because they are adults.  Excellent job, Steve!!</p>

<p>In the youth forum now; it's almost over.

<p>Chris: "We have done a really lousy job in our job in our church of telling our kids who they are."</p>

<p>I can see that they are trying to have good values in the rally, but I and others argue that UUism specifically <em>*does not tell people who they are*</em>.</p>

<p class=date>3:51 am 2-9-01</p>

<p>I fell asleep while outside at the worship.  I told Sean to wake me up whenever for Silent Football.</p>

<p>That was around midnightish I think.</p>

<p>No one woke me up, except I woke myself up at 4:30am and wandered around, wondering what happened to Silent Football.</p>

                        <p class=date>early dream</p>

<p class=dream>There was an old man who was the cleaning guy for a small business, who had done market research and found that businesses with old guys doing the cleaning were well trusted businesses because they had apparently been around for a while.  The old guy died and he had no money so he was going to be buried in an unmarked grave, that included some of the youth from my old youth group and I guessed that people would join together to collect money to buy him a marked grave.   I helped make phone calls to people, and I was caling 1 woman and tried to explain the concept of a phone tree to her that she could help me with the calling, but it took her forever to figure out what I was talking about.  She finally got it, but by that time the guy had been buried.</p>

<p class=date>6:24am</p>

<p>- - - second dream:  - - -</p>

<p class=dream>In a military school type thing, we were there on the first day, not really knowing what to do, or what was expected.</p>

<p class=dream>Thousand people were all in this one room, like a gymnasium, and we were all supposed to line up like in the military, but we didn't know in what order.</p>

<p class=dream>Then we were all assigned numbers, randomly, and were told to line up, but we weren't told where the numbers were supposed to go.  My number was 185.  I had no clue if I was supposed to be at the front of a line or the back, or the middle, or near one side of the room or what.  Then the commander guy was all, "184!" and was standing at the front of a line.  He was facing the line, not in the line, commanding 184 to come face him.  I assumed the commander should know what to do, and heard a voice say "go with it," so I went to the back of the next line over.</p>

<p class=dream>From the back of the line, I could see how not-in-line we were, and whispered, "line up" to the person in front of me, with an implied, "pass it on,"  and it seemed to work relatively well, except that we were still not perfectly lined up.  The girl in front of me was from he dorms at UH, but I forgot her name.  Top floor Settegast, suitemates with Celeste and Meredith.  I'll know her name if you say it.</p>

<p class=dream>Anyway, my line started marching forward, but I was slightly not keeping up, which seemed strange given that everyone else in the line was keeping up just fine.  The line marched around in a loop and nearly caught up with me, but I was somehow facing the line leader instead of them facing my back.</p>

<p class=date>6:30am</p>

<p>Peter just threw up.  I just fed him and he just threw up.</p>

<p class=dream>I caught up with the line again, and  then the girl in front of me almost took her clothes off just so she could tuck in her shirt.  Then Nathan Ryan look-alike was all, "come with me."</p>

<p class=dream>He led me to the back of the building, where there were two restrooms.  Into the men's restroom where three other people were chilling, and apparently expecting me.  One flicked his cigarette butt at me and it hit my foot.  I  was all, "hey fucker, that hit my foot!"  and I was going to kick his ass, but I couldn't.  Then the next guy threw a cigarette butt at me and it hit me in the face.  I was also unable to hit him.  When the third guy did the same, I was able to pick up a bucket of plaster of paris and threw it on his foot.  The bucket split, and glooped plaster of paris all over his foot and leg.</p>

<p class=dream>He accused, "that's a fine-able offense!" and I said something like, "you can't prove it, or you can't catch me," because at that point I was floating away from the scene; I knew it was a dream and I could fly.</p>

<p class=dream>I was flying up along the power lines, and realized I had to got pee, but I couldn't go pee because I was sleeping and I didn't want to wake up from my lucid dream.</p>

<p class=dream>I was flying over the building in which we had all been, and the ranks of people were still inside, but I chose to watch TV that was in front of me.  It wasn't floating with me, but it was right with me, as if I were now both floating, but in a room with a TV.</p>

<p class=dream>I was watching some cartoon show, and then I had to pee so I went to pee in my dream, but it didnt' seem to relieve anything, and I went back to the TV, but now I was sitting on the TV and it was pointing toward the wall.  I could still see its image projected onto the wall, and I wondered how that worked.  I thought I had woken up by this point to go P.</p>

<p class=dream>So I was watching cartoons reflected off a brick wall, and then I was being served a drink by Marcel, who was in a fancy restaurant serving drinks to all the empty tables.</p>

<p class=dream>I was in the room so he offered me a drink.  I asked if it was alcholic, and he was all, Yes, so I said I didn't want any.  He poured it anyway, and I did not drink it, but I soon woke up for real this time.</p>

<p>We're in Corsicana now at Wende's, chillin' and eating and writing journal entries, respectively.</p>

<p>How often do I hit the z key?</p>

<p>So we have yet to pick up Paul; he's about 2 miles up the road at the Texaco, but it was determined that he should wait there for a bit while we eat.</p>

<p>When we left Houston, it was raining a bit, but nothing like during our trip to OKC. </p>

<p>Laura (Erica's mom) and I have been talkin' computer stuff most of the way up here.  Three vehicles total.  The youth (Amy) organized them all.  Great job, guys!  And thanks to your respective parental units for the vehicles.</p>

<p>Erica is full after she ate fries.  Very weird, she says.</p>

<p>Before the rally, Katharine gave me a ride from work to get my car at the shop.  We had a great conversation about religion and God and the nature of sin and afterlife and all that.  Wonderful conversation for about 45 minutes.  Finally I had to leave for the woodlands.  We'll pick up the conversation on Tuesday or so.</p>

<p class=date>11:59 pm Friday 31 August 2001</p>

<p>294 miles traveled</p>

<p>TinaP's head hurts badly after eating ice cream really fast and chasing Ryan.</p>

<p>So we just went to McDonald's and I was dismayed that we didn't all go to the <em>Braum's</em> next door.  So after Ryan briefed me on his Pink Elephant Joke, starring George Foreman, we (Ryan and I, not George Foreman) went over to Braum's.</p>

<p>I complimented him on a great Elephant Joke as we walked spiritfully to Braum's.  Ryan reached forward to politely open the door for me, but it was stuck.  They were closed.</p>

<p>"Nooooooo!!!!"  I collapsed onto my back. "Fifty yards we walked <em>all the way</em> to Braum's and they're closed!!!!"</p>

<p>"Oh, the agony!" chimed Ryan.</p>

<p>We looked plaintively in to the employees, who were no longer looking at us.  "Aw, they don't care; let's go."</p>

<p>Ryan was all, "okay, it's all about presentation.  We should go into McDonald's holding our stomachs, 'Oh my god that Braum's ice cream is SO GOOD!!  Oh you guys missed it; they are closed now.   You should consider staying overnight until they open because it's just that good.'"</p>

<p>I suggested that we could walk through the McDonald's drive through and get ice cream in unmarked cups.</p>

<p>Instead, we went inside and each got a McFlurry.  But... and here is where the story takes a turn for the worse, or the better, depending on one's point of view. (Most people would say it took a turn for the bizarre).  The guy squirted the ice cream into my cup and then gave it two taps, "spanks if you will," proposed Ryan, to settle the ice cream.   Ryan got three spanks.  <em>three</em>! </p>

<p>But, that's nothing.  Marky Mark got <em>four</em> spanks, more ice cream, and one more spank!!  For a total of FIVE spanks!!  FIVE!!</p>

<p>308 miles traveled now.</p>

<p>Wende woke up while I was typing and came to sit by me.  When I was done, I said, "hi," and she was all, "how long is your dream??"</p>

<p>This is scary-ish - Houston is flooding in parts again, and I'm trying to go to Oklahoma tonight.  The last time I went, to OKC, Houston had a "500 year flood."  Now I'm not all that supersticious, but holy fuck I was mad that I wasn't here to see the insane amount of flooding.  Could it *possibly* happen again so soon?  Yes, but I don't think it will.  But it's definitely a bit freaky.</p>

<p>They keep announcing on the radio that several streets in south houston are impassable.  Not like hundreds of streets, but 3 or 4 streeets and highways mentioned.</p>

<p class="date">7:00am</p>

<p>Small stream flood advisory has been announced, and flash flood advisory still in effect.</p>

<p>I'm going to pack now for Tulsa.  Less than 50 minutes before I have to be packed for Tulsa and ready for work!  Wende is taking me because my car is at the shop.  It should be ready today before we go.</p>

<p>This is a test entry that I'm writing with 
<a href="https://www.allaire.com/Products/HomeSite/">Homesite</a>.</p>

<p>Wende says hi.</p>

<p class="date">10:07pm</p>

<p>Now she's going to bed.  I was showing her that Netscape 6.1 will store the output of searches in the sidebar for later browsing.  Pretty slick, that Netscape 6.1.</p>

<p>Homesite is pretty slick, too.  Costs $89 though.  We just got it today so Wende can work on her website.  I'll give the URL when she's ready to let people see.</p>

<p>I'd like to figure out how to tell it a list of common tags I write in my entries so it can help me write them more quickly.</p>

<p>Oh, I figured out one thing interesting today.</p>

<p>How I'll know I'm living in the future:</p>

<ul>
    <li>I'll wear my internet connection and people will be able to IM me at any time (if I want)</li>
    <li>We'll have a robot that can vaccuum the floors, including going up and down stairs</li>
    <li>Most houses are equipped with solar cells and can sell electricity to the power company (who will pay the highest amount at that moment)</li>
    <li>Cars are hovercars</li>
    <li>Houston has a train system</li>
</ul>

<p>The first one in the list is what I came up with first, but the rest are all equally valid.</p>

<p>Okay, I'm going to bed.  Tulsa Rally tomorrow!!!  I've got to pack!</p>

<p>I just chatted with Laura, and discovered what 5 languages I want to
learn:</p>

<pre>
rob: French is not on my top 5 languages to learn, I don't think.  Maybe it
is.
rob: Spanish,
rob: ASL
rob: Japanese
rob: German
rob: French
rob: ah, it is.
laura: aha!
rob: English & Spanish should get me pretty far in the western world and
Europe
rob: ASL because it's cool as shit
rob: Japanese because it's a challenge & 1/2, and cool as shit
rob: German and French to begin my European language conquest
</pre>

<p>So nice to have goals!</p>

<p>Great stuff today - got to make a new cool change
to an email sending program.  Now it allows emails to
be sent according to the participant's
survey_type.</p>

<p>I have studied spanish first thing in the morning
when I wake up for two mornings now.  I'll do it again
tomorrow, and I look forward to getting back on track
after the rally.  I won't pretend that I'll stay
focused enough to study while I'm there!</p>

<p>I'm kinda sorta maybe wondering how I'll get to the
woodlands tomorrow.  My car is in the shop, and I
don't know exactly when it will be ready.  I might get
a ride from TinaP; I might ask Katharine, who is not
usually busy during the day.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, so I called Katharine who played Tina in
"Ruthless" after I wrote the entry from a couple days
back, and just thanked her for such a cool show.  We
talked a bit and will go to lunch on Tuesday.  She
looked up me-an-Wende's birthdates on her
personality-type looker-upper to see how compatable we
are.  I'll find out on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Cool; bye.</p>
