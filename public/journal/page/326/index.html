<p>"May I see your ticket?"</p>

<p>"Ummm."</p>

<p>I think this is the same terminal where I initially arrived.  Over
there is the Meeting Area where DruDaddyG and I first met, except
where we sat there is now a table with internet connected laptops on
it.</p>

<p>An arriving passenger greeted her friend with a lei, and I almost
cried at the idea of.... emotion?  care?  connection?</p>

<p class=date>4:28pm</p>

<p>I was just beginning to think dreadful thoughts.  I replaced them
with happiness, then suddenly turned around to see janette smiling and
resplendant behind a huge box carrying my bike.</p>

<p>On the way to Shibuya today, I got on a Hibiya line train, lightly
sprinkled with people.  Transfered to a full Tokyu line train,
standing near the front behind a young woman against the front glass.
I reminded myself of standing behind Britt at the Snow concert at UH
back in the day.  I blocked her from the crushing crowd behind us.</p>

<p>As the train became more and more packed, I felt it my civic duty
to give her space, after the horrible stories I've heard of men
pressing themselves forcibly against women in trains.  I just wanted
to correct all the wrongs in the world, possibly doing something
uniquely positively surprisingly good for this woman, bracing myself
against the wall and the window instead of against her.</p>

<p>My right hand against the glass, my left hand in my pocket so it
wouldn't brush or be crushed gropingly against someone's booty, I
stood resisting the crowd pressure behind me.  Then the forces were
shifted as the train descended a hill *and* slowed at the same time,
shifting untold tons of silent sentient flesh against me and my
protectee.</p>

<p>I couldn't keep off her, but I diverted as much pressure as I could
to my feet and arm.  After the train stopped and the pressure
lessened, I said "gomen" under my breath.  Took my left hand out of my
pocket so I could use it as a brace.</p>

<p>The next descending stopping avalanche of pressure made me wonder
if my arm might break through the glass against which I was diverting
all the force.  That would *suck*.  Would people understand why it
happened?  That my altruistic moment had saved this woman (save for
blood and glass on her face) from excruciating pressure at the expense
of my arm?  Maybe.  okay, let's focus on the window staying intact
instead.</p>

<p>Upon arrival in Shibuya, people poured out of the train on both
sides, like carbonated spam might upon release.  My well preserved
friend joined the masses of robots.  I never saw her face.</p>

<p>When trains zoom past one another on nearby tracks, it sounds like
a <em>bang</em> rattarattarattaratta as the windows all vibrate.
janette and I are on the train now and she jumps each time it happens.
I've gotten used to them since I've lived here.  She said it was
thrilling.</p>

<p>Lots of thrills on the way home!</p>

<p>janette took Reece's Cups up to Olivia, whose squeal of thanks
could be easily heard throughout the courtyard.</p>

<p>She brought a ton of cookies and chocolate!</p>

<p>Called janette today after work and talked to her a bit, 45 minutes
before she left for the airport to come see me!   Whoooooo!</p>

<p>I was like, "next time I talk to you, it will be face to face!"</p>

<p>This morning I was on the phone with janette and I got a text from
Rieko.</p>

<p>おはよう！　いま、　ほんやのまえに　います。</p>

<p>I read it a few times, trying to interpret it any way other than,
"Good morning!  Right now I am in front of the bookstore."</p>

<p>FUCK!</p>

<p>"sorry; I gotta go."</p>

<p>Called Rieko and ended up going there, arriving 30 minutes late for
our 10:45 <em>AM</em> appointment.  She said it was after her work; I
assumed it was work during the day (evening) like mine.  Nope.</p>

<p>Got a lot of good practice in.  Awesome.  I have nearly memorized
the first three lines of the second page.</p>

<p>Olivia and Jen came down after work today and used the internet
connection, laughed a lot as they tend to do, gossipy and reading
funny emails from their friends.  I went up to their crib and had a
couple liqueur-filled bottle shaped chocolates and took some pics with
Livia's new camera and stuff.</p>

<p>Scott took me aside and asked about the time I had my cellphone out
in a kids class.  I don't really remember it and I told him so.   Was
also in trouble for using a translator in class.  Bah.</p>

<p>pretty pissy mood after that for a bit; want to quit; why am i
here; what would it take for me to quit; etc.</p>

<p>Good Nova-bashing tonight at the ol' 101. Dan just finished his OJT
today;  Matty and I traded punches at Nova's material.  Matty had a
bit more to say than I do; I think he knows the book more. Nah, not
really, but he was really funny about the fuckin' Everyday
Conversation lessons.</p>

<pre>
"Are you a foreigner?"

"What's that?"

"ARE YOU A FOREIGNER?"

"I'm not deaf; you don't have to yell."

"I'm sorry."
</pre>

<p>"Polish that turd for 45 minutes," concludes Matty.  "No thank you;
I'm not fuckin' doin' it."</p>

<p>I pick up janette in 13 hours!</p>
