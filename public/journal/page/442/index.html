<p>What an utterly fantastic phone conversation with Sally!  We talked
for about 2 hours I'm guessing; I told her some stories of my trek and
answered her questions about San Antonio and Houston rallies.  She
told me about the state of her thesis (it's been dragging on for a
while due to losing some data in a crashed raid array) and of her
facist office mates who don't approve of her speaking (even quietly)
for 15 minutes on a personal call during her lunch break.</p>

<p>Talked about overview things and funny things and all kinds of
awesomeness; Sally is just so great!</p>

<p>I still don't know if I like her more than she likes me, but she
gave me the greatest blessing.  Something like, "if I had to list my
five favorite things, one of them would be that you're going on this
awesome trip to Japan," with the implication being that I'm living my
dream adventure and really exploring the world and a new culture and
all that.</p>

<p>We talked about the possibility of her joining me for part of my
western state tour, driving from sunny southern Cali to Washington to
see Olympia Park (I think)... we still need to work out many
details.</p>

<p>She said she would really love to see me <em>right now</em>, and oh
my gosh.. me too.  totally totally totally.</p>

<p>I told her that she is the one reason that I would be tempted to
not stay in Japan for multiple years.</p>

<p>One of my fears is that if I go off to Japan for a long time, that
she would marry someone back here in the US.  But that's a fear based
on hollywood stories, not on real reality.  I think.</p>

<p>But if she's so awesome, she can definitely find a way to come
visit!  We decided that after my first year there, I could take three
months off and we could sail from Japan to New Zealand.  What a
wonderful trip that will be!</p>

<p>Janette and I just played around a park for about an hour; she is
so much fun!  We got some barbecue sandwich and banana pudding from an
inexpensive small restaurant with outgoing friendly woman behind the
counter who said I ought not climb on the statue of a bull out front,
for the artist might come and take me away in irons.</p>

<p>Janette got a picture of me nose to nose with the bull.  I had to
look up for this; it was a tall bull.</p>

<p>The park beckoned for we couldn't find the art museum.  Climbed
across a bayou on large rocks designed for that purpose.  Blocked the
water between the rocks as best I could to recreate the flooding Lisa
and I did in Memphis.  Not as spectacular for there were 20 other
rocks between which the water could flow.</p>

<p>Climbed a set of stairs leading up to a roadway about 40 feet up.
I was surprised to find no fence or railing keeping me from climbing
up the outside of the steps.  I straddled the handrail as I climbed up
(left leg on the inside where legs belong and right leg on the outside
where birds belong)</p>

<p>Got partway up and was thrilled to see that I could climb into the
support structures underneath the bridge!!!  So simple and begging to
be climbed, I was amazed there was no graffiti all over the underside
there.  I climbed around to various spots under the bridge and Janette
took pictures.</p>

<p>Walked around some miniature park railroad tracks while Janette
giggled as I recited Sir Mix-A-Lot's "Baby Got Back."  She's funny
funny funny.</p>

<p>Saw a cat out by a concrete picnic table, just chilling, and then
we saw two more cats beyond him.  Then we saw a cat bringing food over
to the cats.  I was surprised that he left plates on the ground with
the cats as he walked back to his car, but then he got on his bike
with a can (of cat food?) so I guessed he was off to feed more cats
and then would come back and pick up the plates once those cats were
done eating.</p>

<p class=date>4:32pm</p>

<p>Holy cow.  If I could design the perfect water park for me, it
would be a lot like this one in downtown Fort Worth.  Imagine
basically a funnel with water pouring into it, but the funnel is
actually stepped and relatively easily climbable.  Some parts less
steep than others, and some so steep I couldn't climb up them against
the flow of water cascading down.  A big pool in the middle (I'd make
it so the pool was swimmable and really deep and relatively accessible
from all (steep) parts of the funnel so I could slip and just push
backwards really hard and land safely in the pool) with a whirlpool in
it as the water got sucked down.  Wow wow wow.  How fantastic!!!!!</p>

<p>I climbed down the cascading slopes and back up the others and ran
around the perimeter and tried to climb the steepest ones but couldn't
due to their angle and the water pouring down onto me, effectively
dousing my shorts and shirt.</p>

<p>and there were like only two other people there!  How come all of
Fort Worthians aren't there all the time?  That place rules!!</p>

<p>Janette made bread tonight and while it cooked, I read to her most
of the first 6 chapters of <em>Stranger in a strange land</em>, which
I have never previously read.  According to the preface, this version
is from the original transcript, not the one that was originally
published in 1960-something.</p>

<p>Pretty good story.</p>

<p>I appreciate that it was written over a long period of time.  That
helps me have hope for <em>The Past is Now</em>.</p>

<p>Janette and I watched <em>The Hunger</em> tonight, starring David
Bowie, Susan Sarandon (sp) and someone else.  Vampires who grow old
and sexualized violence and a monkey eating its mate.  And slow during
the non action parts.</p>

vanilla ice cream.  Stupid brain sucking and brain enhancing internet
and yummy sugary ice cream.</p>

<p>Caught up on livejournal and news this morning.  Added Megan to my
friends list. After breakfast of yummy bagel, cream cheese, orange
juice and pear, I played pool with Lee Ann (sp), two games, both of
which she won.  Now I'm off to Dallas.</p>

<p>This has been a great and excellent journey.</p>

<p>Chez shaved her head!!!</p>

<p>It looks so awesome!</p>

<p>During the day she got it cut, didn't like it, got it cut again,
and that's when her mom saw it (and liked it fine), but Chez didn't
like it, so she got it shaved.  Her dad saw it and was all, "will it
grow back??"</p>

<p>Her mom hasn't seen it yet, but Chez told her she shaved it and her
mom doesn't believe her.</p>

<p>Chez joked that her dad will be all, "Oh my god did you see Chez'
hair?" and mom will be all, "yeah, I know," like it's no big deal.</p>

<p>Funny.</p>

<p>Janette and I just got chinese food and three (3) movies
<em>invasion of the body snatchers</em>, <em>the hunger</em>, and
<em>art of war</em>.  They are due back in two days.</p>

<p>Final leg of my eastern state trip begins.  I just got gas for
$1.379 per gallon.  3453 miles since Dallas.  146826 miles on Scott.
Apparently five hours drive down 75 to Dallas.  I'm thankful to be
home soon.</p>

<p class=date>5:08pm</p>

<p>Home.  3705 miles round trip to Dallas.  Tired.  Sleep.</p>

<p>After cookies.</p>

<p>Watched <em>Invastion of the Body Snatchers (1978)</em> tonight.
At the end of the movie I asked, "when does it get scary?"</p>

<p>Chez was a bit spooked by the movie.  Jack maybe as well.  Not
really Janette or me.</p>

<p>Tired = Rob.</p>

<p>Sleep.</p>

<p>Janette and I went for a walk and told lots of stories; I
summarized all the craziness during my adventure.</p>

<p>We played on swings and the tree at the park.  We climbed inside a
house under construction with muddy shoes or feet.</p>
