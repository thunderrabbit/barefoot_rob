                        <p class=date>5:27pm CST Wednesday 30 October 2002</p>

<p>Just got home from work.  I've found that three chicken burritos
with cheese is about the perfect amount of food for me for the day.
Janette brought me 6 inches worth of Subway chicken sandwich; that
plus the 3 burritos was a bit too much for the whole day.  So I figure
the three will be perfect.</p>

<p>Anyway, at work we worked and blah blah blah.</p>

<p>I'm most enamoured with a cat named Jah Jah (sp?).  He seems cool
and funny and a hard worker with lots of experience doing a variety of
things there.  He can drive the forklift, use the arc welder, plus all
the tools that I know how to use of course.  But he's funny cause he
does accents and such, from normal soft spoken JahJah to New York
gangsta to Jamaican gangsta.  That one seems to be his favorite,
though he basically just fake threatens people with one line "Ya wah
rahn wi me boah?  Ya wah rahn wi me?"  Which I basically translate to
"you wanna romp with me?" or actual English, "would you like to fight
with me?"</p>

<p>That voice seems to come only at the end of the day, or near the
end after we been working for 6 or 7 hours.</p>

<p>After clocking out, waiting for Janette, I said hi to Oksana (sp)
in Russian, which I learned from Sergay (sp) yesterday.  "Privet"
(written with english characters).  She told me how to say goodbye:
"ohka" and thank you, which I've forgotten, but it starts with an S
sound.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>My fingertips are all covered with dirt that I can't get off
because it's stuck to Great Stuff, a foam filler that we use to adhere
foam blocks to wood until we bolt it on.  Using sucky aluminum rods
that kept snapping when we put moderate tension on them.  Pieces of
crap.</p>

<p>Took Josephine from Tara's house to Aubrey's church so they could
work on a quilting project that is due this week I think.  Josephine
was in a weird mood and I tried to help her focus on some good stuff,
but I recognize that may have been futile.</p>

<p class=dream>Talking with the two members of NWA in my room.  They
were black in my dream with white skin.  I listened to their music and
it was really funny and creative and good.  I told them in honesty
that I now wish I had gotten into them a long time ago so I could have
grown up listening to their shit.</p>

<p class=dream>"But instead, I know all the songs by DJ Jazzy Jeff and
Fresh Prince, plus um, Beastie Boys, and a lot by Sir Mix-A-Lot...  Oh
and Eminem nowadays," which reminded me that I can <em>start</em>
listening to them (NWA) now.</p>

<p class=dream>They nodded understandingly and thoughtfully.  Ah, the
plight of a single lost listener.</p>

<p>Jack was home when we got home and Jackie came over soon
thereafter!  Jackie is greatly contemplating shaving her head; she's
been thinking about it for a while and Chez's shaving helped finalize
the decision.  Jackie's parentals are having some concerns, but Jackie
has a pretty good argument for it.  I helped her practice what she
would say to them.</p>

<p class=date>10:03pm</p>

<p>Jackie has called Jack twice tonight since she left.  I wonder what
they are cooking up...</p>

<p>At work now; I've been here a bit over an hour.  They've been here
a bit over 2 hours.  Um, I got to screw hinges into the back of the
big panels that cover the back of the 'cave'.  Joe (who I keep calling
Roy because I was talking with Roy a lot yesterday and because he
looks a lot more like a Roy than Roy does) helped some and now I'm
helping him bolt the hinges to the facade.  Have to poke the nut
driver (huh huh you said 'poke the nut') through styrofoam so the bolt
will reach it.</p>

<p class=date>12:13pm</p>

<p>Lunch of dos burritos pollos con queso for two dollars including
tax.  Special thanks to Johnny for loaning me lunch money since I
left my wallet in El Segundo.  Actually at The Bibby's</p>

<p>I helped Joe with some more nut poking and stuff before lunch.</p>

<p>This group is pretty fun to work with.</p>

<p class=date>8:05pm</p>

<p>Work is over.  Fun stuff.  I took some pictures with Janette's
camera cause she couldn't find mine.</p>

<p>Janette read a short story to Jack and me.  I fell asleep after
like 2 minutes, I imagine.  I'm quite tired after working today.  Lots
of manual labor carrying around heavy stuff and drilling holes and
bolting bolts and generally working harder than I've worked in quite a
while.  Excellent.  Good night.</p>

<p>Josephine and Janette invited me to pile into bed with them while
Josephine told us all about the rally.  I most enjoyed her description
of Silent Football, which I found to be hilarious!  I forget the best
part, but let me assure you, it was great.</p>

<p>I pinched Joey a bit with my toes and tried to tickle her but she
was pretty much too strong.  Josephine was all "mom, Rob's being mean
to me!" and Janette goes, "Rob, don't get your sister all riled up
before bed..."  Funny.</p>

<p>So glad that the weekend was wonderful.</p>

<p>Last night Janette and I worked at her work for some hours, but I
think she was getting tired because she made an error (forgetting to
measure a thing before sewing (she assumed it was the correct length))
so we went home before the job was complete.</p>

<p>I'm going back to her work this morning, which thankfully will
become my work too; Johnny has offered me about two weeks worth of
work there.  I'm really thankful for that!</p>

<p class=date>9:57pm CST Monday 28 October 2002</p>

<p>Hahah exactly 12.5 hours later...</p>

<p>So, um work was good today; i enjoy the variety.  I helped Janette
put on some grommets and then loaded up some cloth into a barrel and
then painted purple paint onto some large sheets of styrofoam cut to
look like rocks.  Then I cleaned up two distinct sections of the
woodshop area.  The first I just basically swept and restacked some
boards.  Second area was more involved because some of the wood had
been damaged by water.  I threw away some of that wood and in some
cases used the table saw to trim off the water damaged sections.  I
screwed together some 2x4s with some 1x4s to make a rudimentary wood
stacking place to keep it up out of the water.</p>

<p>Then I helped the guys building the stage structure thing on which
the rock facade will be placed.  (the purple is just an undercolor in
case the painters miss any rocks with rock colored paint) Big super
ultra sturdy structure of 2x2 square steel tubes and good quality 3/4"
plywood as flooring.  It's to be a permanent installation
apparently.</p>

<p>Just played disc with Maggie, Sean, Hart, Janette and I plus five
discs.  We started out playing Disc Cover and then changed to golf and
then just tossing them around at the park.</p>

<p>I got bored of disc and went to the swings and Hart jumped out of a
swing and landed wrongly and nearly bonked his head on a concrete
border on the playground.  Scary for a second.</p>

<p>I climbed all over the playground equipment and slid down the wet
slide and almost fell backwards, but landed only on my feet.  I
crouched lower the second time I went down and Maggie + Janette said
it looked much more graceful and like a surfer.  Nice.</p>

<p>I tried an upside down thing on the playground and bonked my head
slightly.  Oww.. that wasn't planned.</p>

<p>I went upside down on another thing and had my hands locked so that
if I had fallen over (and I nearly did), I would have likely sprained
or broken <em>both</em> my wrists at the same time.  Wow.  That would
have been amazing.</p>

<p>I discovered a tree nearby and climbed up and around its branches,
wondering what it would be like as a squirrel, leaping effortlessly
from branch to branch.  I wasn't so effortless, but still had a good
time.  Gave the tree a big hug after I jumped down.  I appreciate
trees and their patience.</p>
