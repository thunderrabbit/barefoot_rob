<p><p class=date>3:07 AM Wednesday, May 6th, 1992.</p>

<p><p>Yesterday (today) my dad and I fixed the van brakes.  They work
great now.  Then I went to House of Pies with everyone.  We took 7
seven(!) people in Molly&rsquo;s car, so Jeanine and I (both) together rode
in the trunk.  Cool.  We didn&rsquo;t kiss or anything as she was not in the
mood.  We got funny looks from people at House of Pies who saw us get
in and out of the trunk.  Later</p>

<p><p class=date>Monday, May 5, 1992 10:30PM</p>

<p><p>All my school save finals is over.  Recently we had a test in calc
III for which I had not gone to lecture or done homework or anything.
So I learned all of chapter 14, which covers triple integrals, in one
weekend.  That Monday morning, I woke up and took the test and then
had to work on the VAX to finish up my assembly language program.  I
worked on the program until work. I went to work and then went to bed
immediately after that (9:30PM) I slept until 2AM and then woke up and
showered &amp; got some Chef Boy-ardee pasta and went out to the school.
I VAXed with Maggie who had been awake and on the VAX since like 3PM,
until 8:30 AM when the program was due.  I &lsquo;finished&rsquo; it at 8:20 AM
and waited until precisely 8:30 AM to submit the thing.  Dude.  I got
a 91 on that Calculus test.  I haven&rsquo;t gotten the program back yet.</p>

<p><p>Today I went through Add/Drop to fix one of my classes.  The
girl/woman who helped me had one blue eye and one green eye.  Oh how
beautiful.  I told her, too.  I wonder if I&rsquo;ll ever see her again.
Maybe not, but her name is Vicki. Maybe I&rsquo;ll hang around that building
more often.  Also today I interviewed for a UPS job.  I told them I
could work 11:30PM to 3AM. Sister Gemma tentatively offered me a job
in the main pharmacy on weekends.  She hasn&rsquo;t gotten it approved yet,
but I&rsquo;ll get it if she does.  And last, after work today, Heather and
I went to Bookstop.  I bought the LISP book that I&rsquo;ll need for next
semester, and <em>Wishcraft</em> by Barbara Scher.</p>

<p><p>Also, the van brakes are sucking hard, so dad will come out
tomorrow to help me fix those.  I have made a decision to purchase at
least a 386DX/33MHz + 2 meg w/SVGA + 1 meg onboard at the beginning of
summer.  Fred is going to move in with me for 2 months (June &amp;
July). But before that, Maggie is going to move in with me for 2
weeks.  Cool.  I intend to learn C &amp; LISP over the summer.</p>

<p><p>I met Wendy before school today at Social Work.  We sat at the
computer and she read while I did FTP. I printed out ALL of my mail
messages.  We kissed just as she had to go to class.  My lump in my
breast is not going away.  I may have to have it removed.  That&rsquo;s
about it.  Later</p>

<p><p class=date>1 AM Wednesday Morning April 22, 1992</p>

<p><p>I spent the night at Jodi&rsquo;s last night.  Then we went to class.
After assembly, Maggie &amp; Molly got me some extra food for lunch for
me.  We had a picnic in Maggie&rsquo;s room.  Then Maggie &amp; I went to
Physics.  At the very end of the lecture, Dr. Weinstein briefly
described where the speed of light comes from and how light is
created.  That was cool.  Ultimately Cool.</p>

<p><p>Then I lay outside on the grass with Danielle and we worked on
assembly.  Then I went to Jodi&rsquo;s to say &ldquo;HI.&rdquo; She&rsquo;s sick, though, so I
didn&rsquo;t spend too much time there.  So I went up to Jeanine&rsquo;s room.  We
cuddled and almost slept for a couple of hours.  At one point, Jen&rsquo;s
roommate, Dametrus &amp; one of her friends were in there.  Dametrus&rsquo;
friend asked for Dametrus to walk with her over to Oberholtzer Hall.
Dametrus said, &ldquo;Look at it this way; God&rsquo;s your friend. He&rsquo;ll walk
with you.&rdquo; That was so so funny.</p>

<p><p>Jeanine &amp; I cuddeled but didn&rsquo;t kiss.  Then I cam home and worked
on my budget.  Then I went over to Lucy&rsquo;s to help her move her couch.
WE got it up to her apartment and she was so giggly/excited to have it
up there.  I just love the way she smiles when she&rsquo;s like that.  We
lay on the couch for a while and talked about us and relationships and
stuff like that.  I rubbed her feet during this time.  Then I crawled
up onto her and we kissed and kissed.  That was nice.  She wasn&rsquo;t in a
kissing mood, though so she kept interrupting by talking.  After a
while, though we moved to her bed and kissed some more.  At one point,
she asked what I was thinking, so I told her: since I was coming over
to Lucy&rsquo;s tonight, I gave up my chance to do anything with Jeanine.
This statement pissed off Lucy like crazy, since she thought I was
just putting a guilt trip on her.  I told her &ldquo;Two things (1) I don&rsquo;t
do guilt trips. You asked me what I was thinking, so I told
you. (2)&hellip;&rdquo; I forgot what I said for (2).  But I got my point across
and we didn&rsquo;t fight.  Cool.  Then we were cuddling, and out of the
blue she asked, &ldquo;Are these really draw string shorts?&rdquo;  &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; &ldquo;Do they
loosen easily?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; &ldquo;Do they come off easily?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; So she took my
shorts off and began to give me head.</p>

<p><p class=note>(33 lines skipped)</p>

<p><p>Dude.  We gripped eachother hard and I lay on top of her for a
while.  Then we got up and got dressed.  We talked and ate some
bananas and pickles.  Super.  She was in a giggly mood again, so we
laughed a lot.  Then I came home and here we are. (Just me actually)</p>

<p><p>Kiera called today &ldquo;looking for a shoulder to cry on.&rdquo;  Aww. I felt
so bad for her and I left a message on her machine telling her to call
any time at all.  Mine is a 24 hour (crisis) Hot line. later</p>

<p><p class=date>11:05 AM, Monday, April 20, 1992</p>

<p><p>Saturday Night after work, Jodi picked me up and we went to see
Oliver (the play) performed at Miller Outdoor Theatre.  We got a little
bit past the first intermission before we left.  While we were there,
we did some heavy petting.  Then we went home to our separate places.
The next morning, Sunday, I went in to work at 6AM.  Matt was the over
night checker.  He said that during the night, 2 queers were kissing &amp;
they knocked over a display of toilet paper.  Ha Ha.. that&rsquo;s funny.</p>

<p><p>I had a guy come in &amp; buy 30 pounds of potatoes and a single
potatoe peeler.  I asked him jokingly, &ldquo;Are you sure you need just one
of these?&rdquo; while holding up the peeler.  He kind of grunted &amp; pointed
at the potatoes. I said, &ldquo;Oh, Thanks for clearing that up for us.&rdquo;
That was hilarious.</p>

<p><p>After work, Jodi &amp; I went to the Transco Tower water fountain to
meet Blue Moon &amp; people from the Castle of Dreams &amp; Rivan Warrior
BBS&rsquo;s.  We played frisbee &amp; played a frisbee-into-the-net game.  I
won.  Cool.  I got some excellent scores, like 2 10 pointers in a row
&amp; then a 1 point, a 5 point &amp; 2 more 10 points in a single turn.
Dude.  I won with 111 points to 60 or so.  After that, Jodi &amp; I went
to Marble Slab and then to our separate houses.  Then Lucy called and
came over here.  We kissed some and I fingered her and made her come.
Then it began to strom like a motherfucker and she went home.  She
apologized for not helping me come, but she didn&rsquo;t want to be caught
in the rain.  She said she&rsquo;ll make it up by giving me head tonight.
After she left, I watched the storm.  There was hail about an inch
across falling at one point.  Dude.  Lucy called during the storm and
she said she needed to tell me some things.  She said that she has
fallen for me more than she ever wanted to. Arrghh.. One time my
horoscope said, &ldquo;&hellip;but remember, you&rsquo;re a magnet for romance.&rdquo; We&rsquo;ll
talk about this lots tonight.  Then Tammy called and said she was
scared because of the storm and wanted to come over.  So she came over
and we fucked, using a condom of course, and then slept.  This
morning, I took my computer disk drives and my laundry to her house
and she did my laundry while I gave her Word Perfect &amp; Lotus and I got
some software from her.  Then I came home and I&rsquo;m right here right now
at 11:30 AM on Monday April 20, 1992.  I am quickly falling behind in
my school work. Crap. I need to figure out a way to sel my romance
magnet abilities&hellip; I don&rsquo;t even know what they are.  Later</p>

<p><p>(Same day) I started driving to school, then thought, &ldquo;who am I
kidding? I&rsquo;m going to fail this Calculus quiz anyway.&rdquo; So I came back
home and I just now cleaned up my office/sun room.  There&rsquo;s a bunch of
Tammy&rsquo;s junk on my bed now. &ldquo;Silent all these years.&rdquo; by Tori Amos
(sp) is on the radio right now.  Line from the song: &ldquo;My dog won&rsquo;t
bite if you sit real still/I&rsquo;ve got the anti-christ in the kitchen
yelling at me again.&rdquo;  Dude.  I&rsquo;ve got to go to work now.  <em>Maybe</em>
Lupe will be there, but it&rsquo;s highly unlikely.  Remind me to tell you
about her.</p>

<p><p class=date>9AM Friday, April 16, 1992</p>

<p><p>Last Sunday I was at Kroger working during the Westheimer Art
Festival.  Lucy walked in.  We saw eachother and were entirely stunned
and amazed.  We exchanged phone numbers and I called her at 11PM that
night.  We talked until about 1:30AM.  During that talk, I told her
that I wanted to go out with her and that I had Jodi.  Lucy told me to
seriously think about my situation.  I did and the next (same) morning
I broke up with Jodi.  I told Jodi that she is wonderful, but that I&rsquo;m
just not ready for committment. the next night, Lucy called at about
11 or Midnight. We talk for a while, and she ended up coming and
sleeping over here.  Cool.  We made out, and she gave me head, but we
did not have sex.  The next night, I helped her move to a small
apartment very near my house.  I spent the night over there and the
next morning, we did have sex, using a condom, of course.  Then, last
night, I went over and helped her finish moving.  In exchange, she
took me to The Olive Garden.  She had a lifecycle in the trunk of her
car, so she asked the manager if she could park in the &ldquo;to go&rdquo; parking
spot.  She was wearing her white hat and great smile, so he let her.
That was cool.  We went in to the bar and drank milk (me) and wine
(her).  Then we ate.  It was cool.  Then we went back and unloaded
stuff.  She gave me a Madonna poster book.  She also gave me the April
edition of Vogue because I love the cover. (12 women in white).  We
had sex using some hot cinamon cream then we showered and had sex
again.  It was great.  Jodi is not moving in this summer. Fred
probably will.</p>

<p><p class=date>Friday March 27, 1992</p>

<p><p>My birthday was great.  After we shopped at Target, we went to
Herman park area and walked around.  We walked around the fountain
that is in the circle intersection of Montrose and Main Street.  We
walked around the lake beside the zoo, and made a side trip to the
park near the zoo and Ben Taub hospital.  Then Jodi went to work and I
played at home.  After she got back, we went to Marble Slab for my
birthday party.  I posted an open invitation to everyone on the
Castle.</p>

<p><p>Incredibly enough and <em>wonderfully</em> Tara and Windy the Wise
came!  They go by Cathy and Walt in real life.  It was so great to see
them and I was so happy that they came!  We talked until about
Midnight or 12:30, then Jodi and I went to bed.  She had to get up
early to go work at McDonald&rsquo;s, so we set the alarm for 5AM.  She got
up and the phone rang.  It was McDonald&rsquo;s: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come in to work. We
don&rsquo;t have a uniform for you.&rdquo;  Dude.  So she hopped back in bed with
me.</p>

<p><p>Thursday we went back to Marble Slab and then to Kroger to get
milk.  We also went to Niko Nikos for lunch.  That was great.  I got
Jodi to call the Castle of Dreams. Her handle is !Kung Baby.  Cool.
So she left 2 messages to different people (Jack Dracula and
All). Then she worked and I played on the computer.  After work she
called the Castle back, but hadn&rsquo;t gotten any messages.  After that we
backed up the hard drive.  Jodi sat with me the whole time.  I enjoyed
that immensely.  I told her all about the files we were backing up.
After that was done, we went to bed and engaged in wild sex.  It was
great.</p>

<p><p class=note>(four lines skipped)</p>

<p><p>After that we crashed back into bed.  I looked at the clock and it
was 3AM!  Oh my gosh&hellip; So we conked out and I woke up at 8AM like
normal.  I took the computer apart, and with a little bit of trouble,
I got Tammy&rsquo;s working again. (At the time, it seemed like a lot of
trouble, but I don&rsquo;t remember now what the big deal was, so I&rsquo;ll just
forget it.)  So Tammy took me to her house and I set up her computer
there.  While we were there, we determined why we broke up.  It was
basically because she would never do the little things that I wanted
her to do, such as wear bright red lipstick, or take showers with
me. She said she knew this was true, and that if she could do it all
over again, there would be some things that she would change.  That
sent me to tears for a bit, and she held me.</p>

<p><p>Then I cam home and got <em>my</em> computer back to working
again.  Cool.  That&rsquo;s really making a long story short, but I&rsquo;m
tired.  After Jodi&rsquo;s work today, we joined the people from my work at
the pharmacy at Birraporetti&rsquo;s.  Cool.  It was for a free pizza party
since Birraporetti&rsquo;s screwed up last time we were there.  It was also
a birthday party for me.  Cool.  They got me a big set of glasses.
Excellent.  Then Jodi and I came home, and we are Blue Waving on the
Castle.  Later</p>

<p><p class=date>7:330 AM Wednesday March 25th, 1992.</p>

<p><p>I am now 22.  Monday we went to get the house keys copied for Jodi
and then went to look for some sandals for me.  We couldn&rsquo;t find any
that were wide enough.  The guy there said I ought to call a
podiatrist, who could tell me where in town someone could custom make
sandals for me.  Then we drove to Allen Parkway and walked about 1.5
miles.  That was nice.  I took some mental notes on the ball shaped
water fountain.  I estimated .1 gallons per second comes out of each
tube and there are 200 tubes =&gt; 20 gallons per second.  Pretty cool.
Then Jodi had to go to work.  While she worked, I called Castle of
Dreams.  I&rsquo;ve been pretty active on there lately.  I just found out
that Caleb/Black Magus is coming to UH in the Fall!  That will be
great.  Oh- either Sunday or Monday night Jodi took me to a carnival!
Fantastic.  We rode bumper cars together and the ferris wheel.  While
waiting for the ferris wheel, part of it fell.  Dude.  A small part -
one of the back rests of the chair.  Not a vital part, but it could
have killed(?) knocked someone out good if it had hit them.  While
waiting, Jodi and I finished off our carmel apple.  I asked the guy
where the trash was. He said &ldquo;right there.&rdquo;  I said &ldquo;Here on the
floor?&rdquo;  He said &ldquo;yeah you can throw it on the floor but not the
ground.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Ok&rdquo; So I tossed it onto the ferris wheel platform.  He was
like, &ldquo;Mannn&hellip;&rdquo; And walked up there and kicked it off.  One of the
side booths was throw-the-ball-and-break-a-bottle.  Cool.  They had
beer bottles inverted into holes in planks of wood.  Some mexican guys
were playing.  One dude was throwing the ball FAST. But he kept
missing.  That was a brilliant game.  People love to break glass, so
they&rsquo;ll pay to do it, and the carnival can get bottles for free off
the street.</p>

<p><p>Tuesday we went to the school.  Jodi went to the library. I went to
the VAX and got a tone of different files.  I still haven&rsquo;t unarchived
them yet. (I&rsquo;ve only gone through all the gifs. I have enough gifs
that I put them into different directories: girls, guys, cartoons,
cool stuff, etc. (I got the guys for Jodi)  I&rsquo;ll split the girls into
PG13, R, &amp; X rated.  We played Frisbee with Marcel and Molly for a
bit.  At the end, we were discussing how to make the Discs of Tron
game a reality.  In the movie, each player tosses a (energy) ball back
and forth (Maybe &ldquo;toss&rdquo; is the wrong word) And a player has to keep it
from hitting the ground, or that section of his ground will dissapear.</p>

<p><p>Now it&rsquo;s Wednesday, my birthday.  Jodi is sleeping here beside me
after our shower.  I fucked her from behind in the shower and squirted
in her.  Today we&rsquo;re going to go shopping for some plastic containers
for Aunt Jemima &amp; Bisquick and flour and stuff.  Later</p>

<p><p class=date>Sunday March 22, 1992</p>

<p><p class=message>Hi! This is Jodi.  I&rsquo;m Rob&rsquo;s girl now so I guess I
need to log in because we each our such big parts of eath other&rsquo;s
life&rsquo;s.  I was very surprised and delighted that Rob wanted me to be a
part of his diary.  I was curious to find out more about him and I&rsquo;m
excited that he wants me to.  If this weekend has been just a little
sampling of what the summer is going to be like, then I think this is
going to be the best summer ever! :)</p>

<p><p class=message>It&rsquo;s so great how Rob and I like so many similar
things.  Friday after work I stopped at my dorm room and packed my car
full of stuff.  I hat a suitcase with all my clothes plus a bag of
food and three boxes Rob is going to keep for me till the summer.  Rob
helped me unload the car and put things away.  It was so great when
Rob offered me my own shelf in the bathroom.  It really made me feel
comfortable and at home.  I got out my scrap book and showed Rob all
my pictures from Germany.  I talked so much I got horse but its been
quite a while since I had gotten my pictures out.  It was wonderful to
share them with someone I care for so deeply and to see his
interest.  We then made our Shopping List and decided to go shopping
Saturday after Rob got done at Kroger&rsquo;s.  It&rsquo;s been so long since I&rsquo;ve
felt truelly on the same level with the guy that I was going out
with.  I think we&rsquo;ve both had enough experience to realize what is
important in a relationship and thus hopefully we can make this last a
long time. (It&rsquo;s truelly what I would love! :)  I thought a
relationship with Rob would only mean &ldquo;Great Sex&rdquo; but it&rsquo;a a lot
more.  I think that &ldquo;lot more&rdquo; is what both of us is looking for.
Right now I believe it&rsquo;s more me then Rob but hopefully he&rsquo;s seeing
things differently through my eyes.</p>

<p><p class=message>So, back to our daily activities.  Saturday, Rob got
up early before work and checked my anti-freeze and put WD-40 in my
door locks because my key kept getting stuck.  He is such a [heart]
&ldquo;sweetie.&rdquo;  For his working on my car I&rsquo;m going to clean his (our)
Apartment.  So I ran to the bank real quick to get my check cashed,
went by K-mart to pick up basic essentials &amp; oil so Rob can change my
oil.  After that I went by the dorms to pick up some things I&rsquo;d
forgotten.  I saw Laura and Kim walking out to the parking lot.  They
were to far out to talk to and I doubt Larua would want to talk to me
anyways.  I try to stop myself from thinking about her but it just
really upsets me.  I want her as a friend so much but can&rsquo;t stand the
fact of how selfish she can be.  Hopefully things can get back on
track because I would hate for these events to end all my friendships.
I think that&rsquo;s what really bothers Laura, the fact that I would pick
Rob over her if it came down to it.  I can&rsquo;t help it if Rob makes me
feel so wonderful.  I&rsquo;ve been so content these last few weeks.  It&rsquo;s
hard to believe I was even thinking about leaving Houston for good.
I&rsquo;ve been in such an excellent mood this past week.  The best thing
about it is that I know it&rsquo;s not just the typical infactuation that I
would feel for a new guy in my life.  It goes much more beyond that.</p>

<p><p class=message>I got back from running my errands and found Rob had
been home over his break.  I was so bummed I had missed him.  He left
me a great note.  What a Babe!  Well, I went to work cleaning the
bathroom.  I think it&rsquo;s safe to say Jodi won the war on soap &amp; mildew
scum.  Things were looking pretty good after me and Spencer got
finished.  Spencer didn&rsquo;t actually help me put cheered me on and kept
me company.  After the bathroom it was on to the kitchen.  We did the
dishes and then it was time to clean myself.  I jumped in the shower
thinking I had 1 hour 30 minutes before Rob get&rsquo;s home.  It was so
great when he called on his last break.  I wanted to tell him all
about the cleaning but decided to surprise him when he got home.  I
got my telephone bill sent out and preceded to read my anthropology.
Spencer came and curled up next to me so we took a little snooze;
waiting for Robster to get home.  We went grocery shopping at Kroger&rsquo;s
once Rob got back and I got to meet all the people Rob works with.  We
had a great time shopping and picked up lots of cool stuff, including
a new broom and strawberry &amp; blueberry bagels.  Awesome!  It was
spaghetti time when we got home.  We put the groceries away and
started making the fresh salad and spaghetti.  We really need a lot of
things put eventually we&rsquo;ll have them.  For now we can get along.  The
spaghetti turned out good but the sauce was kind of salty.  We had an
ultimate good feast and then made wild passionate sex.  Rob makes me
feel things I haven&rsquo;t felt in a long time.  Later he showed me his
very cool coin collection.  I could not believe how old some of them
were and Rob most definitely impressed me with his extensive
knowledge.  Then Rob brung out the Marble Trak.  <em>Sooooo</em>
Awesome!  I couldn&rsquo;t believe he had built that himself.  I think I
could play all day long.  What a COOL Toy!  I&rsquo;m so happy Rob is
sharing all his life with me.  I just wish I had more to share with
him. Hopefully he doesn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m totally boring!  I also got
introduced to all his wonderfully cool pictures on the computer.  The
zebras were so neat!  I wish I had a print of those to hang on the
wall.  So much for catching up on prior days.  Lets talk Sunday!  What
better way to start the day then with wild sex!  I&rsquo;m so glad Rob loves
anal sex because sometimes it really turns me on.  It&rsquo;s more wonderful
because I feel I don&rsquo;t have to hold anything back with Rob.  I can
really be myself.  Rob was a real doll and changed my oil while I
cleaned the kitchen and made us pancakes for breakfast.  I think we
make a great team and we&rsquo;ll have a wonderful time together.  Now Rob&rsquo;s
gone to Kroger&rsquo;s and me and Spencer are keeping the apartment
company.  We&rsquo;ve fed the fish (I know, Spencer would have rather eaten
them) and now finishing this entry.  I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll be back later, but
signing off for now.</p>

<p><p class=date>7:55 AM Friday, March 20, 1992</p>

<p><p>this is IT.  Let me explain (Long version) Saturday Cheryl ended up
not going out with me - she had visitors from Austin. So I just worked
on messages from the Castle.  Sunday I went to work and afterward I
had Jodi over and we studied.  She studied anthropology; I studied
calculus.  Monday I had the calc test.  It wasn&rsquo;t too bad.  After
school, I went to work.  During work, I told Emilio about Jodi&rsquo;s
proposition about summer.  He said, &ldquo;why wait?&rdquo;  Indeed.  So after
work I asked Jodi if she wanted to take the committment now.  She
said&hellip;</p>

<p><p>Oh wait.  I forgot something.  After work on Monday, I talked to
Laura. I confirmed with her that she is not staying with us over the
summer.  Cool.  She said basically that I broke up with her before she
was ready.  At the end of our talk, she was all sad and emotional, and
she asked me, &ldquo;Rob can I ask you something?&rdquo;  I was like &ldquo;sure please
do.&rdquo;  She asked &ldquo;Is it bad to want to kiss you one last time?&rdquo;  I
thought for a while.  Finally I said, &ldquo;Not it&rsquo;s not bad, but I can&rsquo;t
do it.&rdquo;  She said, &ldquo;Thank you&hellip; thank you&rdquo; and that was it.. Dude.</p>

<p><p>So after that I asked Jodi if she wanted to really wait until
summer to make a committment.  She said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Mr No Committment
Man.  I&rsquo;d love to now.&rdquo;  So we are officially going together.
Excellent!  We are going to have a fantastic Spring Break.  We slept
over at Jodi&rsquo;s house that night.  The next morning we went to class.
After school, Jodi and I went to the Galleria to go shopping for
Maggie and Molly&rsquo;s birthday.  We got Molly a wooden CD case
identically styled, but twice the size of her current one.  We got
Maggie a wildly colored umbrella.  We stopped by an expensive novelty
store and saw the perfect sandals for me.  They are entirely
waterproof with velcro all over.  They&rsquo;re designed for hiking and
tromping through water, etc.  Cool.  I will most likely get them for my
birthday.  Cool.  Oh we also got Jodi the CD soundtrack for <em>Beauty
and the Beast</em>.  Cool. Jodi went to work and I went to Laura&rsquo;s.
Laura and I struck a deal.  She didn&rsquo;t want to eat anything that they
had at OB.  But she didn&rsquo;t want to waste her board card by not letting
me use it.  But she didn&rsquo;t want to let me use it because of Jodi and
I.  So I told her that I&rsquo;d go to Kroger and get her some stuff she
would eat in exchange for her board card.  So that&rsquo;s what we did.
Cool.</p>

<p><p>That night, Jodi slept with me over at my house.  We had great
sex.  At the end she said, &ldquo;I thought I had done it in every
position.&rdquo; heh heh.  I told her that she still hasn&rsquo;t done every
position.  Wednesday was my Discrete Math test.  I failed it like
crazy.  So I&rsquo;m going to drop the class today.  Wednesday at work we
had an incredible storm.  15 minute period: Literally:  Calm weather.
No wind no rain.  5 minutes later, the wind was so fucking violent
that it wasn&rsquo;t funny.  I watched a trash can blow across the street.
Lamp posts were waving wildly.  The rain was gusting sideways and down
into the street in the same way as ocean water striking a ship during
a tempest.  5 minutes later it was barely sprinkling.  When I got off
work a couple hours (1.5 hours) later, the streets were dry.  Hold
shit.</p>

<p><p>After work, I embarked on my assembly language programming
marathon.  I got to school and we first celebrated Maggie and Molly&rsquo;s
birthday.  We had cake from Kroger and gave them their gifts.  Cool.
Then Maggie and I went to the VAX and laughed and giggled and burped
and listened to music and programmed a little until 4AM.  Before I got
off work, she sent me a wonderful message saying how it was so hard to
work alone and that she wished I was there to help her through it
all.  Very nice.  She had her head phones there and we each used one
in one ear.  At one point we were jamming hard to some good old
tunes.  At 4AM we said forget it and went to bed.  I called Jodi and
crawled into bed with her until about 8AM.  At that time I went to OB
and asked Maggie to sneak out some breakfast for me.  We went to class
and stayed for about 5 or 8 minutes.  Then we went and VAXed all day
until Physics.  Then we went to Physics and then Jodi met me for lunch
for a minute.  Then I VAXed some more until 9:30PM when Jodi got off
work.  I went to eat a pizza slice from Coogs&rsquo; Cafe with Jodi, Then
she got some books and sat ever so patiently with me at the VAX while
I worked.  I got it almost perfect and submitted my final version at
11:51 PM.  9 minutes before it was due.  Then I drove Jodi out to my
house and we lay in bed for a while.  I told her I was slightly horny,
and we started to kiss.</p>

<p><p class=message>(four lines skipped)</p>

<p><p>Dude.  We&rsquo;ll have a great Spring Break.</p>

<p><p>I woke up this morning and did laundry while she slept.  Then we
came back to school.  It&rsquo;s now during my (almost) ex-discrete math
class.  Russ, Steve, and Adrian are outside here at Agnes Arnold
underground on the northwest white wall.  (They are standing on the
ground using the wall as a table to review for linear Algebra test.)
I&rsquo;m sitting on the wall about to give O&rsquo;Malley my drop form. (I failed
the (both) tests in here.)</p>

<p><p>Dude. Yesterday on my way from non breakfast to class at 8:30AM, I
talked to the guys who were assembling the water pipes for the Cullen
fountain.  They assembled a section and then labeled it with magic
marker.  That gave me an idea. &ldquo;May I put my name on one of those?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Which one?&rdquo;  &ldquo;Whichever one you&rsquo;re about to use.&rdquo;  So they handed me
a tube about 4 feet long and 6 inches in diameter and the magic
marker.  I signed &ldquo;Robert was here 3-19-1992&rdquo; Dude.  And when I walked
by there today. I saw the assembled piece with my name prominently on
there.  Ultimately Excellent.  I am now going to be immortalized in
the Cullen Fountain.</p>
