                        <p><title>Unicycling</title>
<p class=date>8:46pm CST Thursday 20 January 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Today I unicycled over 200 feet!  I first started practicing when my brother bought a unicycle around December.  He and I were each able to go about 30 feet, and he could sometimes go 40 feet.  I was so thrilled by my improvement that I borrowed a unicycle and today after practicing less than 2 hours, I went 226 feet!</p>

<p><p>I borrowed it on Tuesday from a guy (Scott) who skates on Tuesday and Thursday nights.  Tonight I made it a goal to uni from my house to where we meet!  I wasn&rsquo;t able to get there in one shot (I even walked part of the way), but by the time I got to the parking lot, I went from one corner to where they were standing on the other side, nearly the entire block!</p>

<p><p>I measured it later to be 32 wheel revolutions, with a wheel 1 foot in diameter, it&rsquo;s like 6.2 * 32 feet!  After they left to skate, I started home and went a distance of 36 wheel revolutions, including down a slight incline!  Aww yeah.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ve heard that tonight is full lunar eclipse night!</p>

                        <p><title>Pre Regression</title>
<p class=date>1:23pm CST Wednesday 19 January 2000</p></p>

<p><p>KTRU was fun today, though not stellar.  The coolest thing: before the show, I told a friend of mine I would play some jungle, so she could hear what I mean when I use that term.  At the station, I couldn&rsquo;t really find any jungle..  we have lots of techno and hip hop, but very little real jungle.</p>

<p><p>So I called Tejus, the DJ who would know, if anyone knew where we had jungle.  He returned my call at noon as I was on the air and I recognized his phone number on the caller ID.  I said, &ldquo;and I am <em>sure</em> I will play some jungle soon!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>He gave me a couple of options:  Photek and Panacea (sp).  I played something from Photek, but it wasn&rsquo;t as heavy crazy huge phat jungle as I wanted.  Nothing has matched the level of beats that I experienced at the house party back in November or so.  That was incredible.</p>

<p><p>Now it&rsquo;s past life regression time!  My appointment is in 30 minutes!  Very exciting!!</p>

<p><p>Did I mention what questions I plan to ask?</p>

<ol>
<p><li>Have previous incarnations of me left messages or objects for my current self to find?

<p><li>May I experience between lives?

<p><li>Have I had any female lives?

<p><li>May I experience my current birth / reasons for this life?
</ol>

<p><p>With Love
<br>- Rob</p>

<p class=date>2:01am CST Tuesday 18 January 2000</p></p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m up late tonight reading Joe McMoneagle&rsquo;s <em>The Ultimate Time Machine</em> in which he makes specific predictions for the next 100 years using information he gained through remote viewing.</p>

<p><p>The coolest of the predictions, or the one that made my heart jump most: A solid object four inches in diameter will actually be teletransported from a point A to a point B, by the year 2050.</p>

<p><p>Wow.</p>

<p><p>The book holds tons of fascinating concepts, with lots of specific predictions.  Many start around 2010, with some as early as 2004.  Many others are from 2050 to 2100.  Awesome stuff!</p>

                        <p><title>Random Stuff</title>
<p class=date>10:28pm CST Tuesday 18 January 2000</p></p>

<p><p>I did random stuff today at work: picked up Deborah&rsquo;s workstation from CPE (they added a modem to it), installed Hot Spot which will turn my screensaver on instantly, inventoried a few more machines, and removed a few old usernames from our system.</p>

<p><p>I also did a lot of chatting on AIM: Bryn, Matt, Bryan, Micaela, Dude, and Rocky.  Biggest chat sessions were with Bryn and Micaela. I might(!) include part of Micaela&rsquo;s because it included some of my thoughts on past lives and past life regression.</p>

<p><p>You know why?  Because tomorrow after KTRU, I will experience a past life regression session with Lily Roddy, an astrologer and stuff in the Houston area.  She was suggested to me by my dad when I asked if he would regress me. (My dad recently obtained a degree in hypnotherapy.)</p>

<p><p>Lily will record the session and I intend to transcribe a great deal of it to my website.  (Assuming a great deal of it is interesting!)</p>

<p><p>Tonight I talked to Marcel.  The moment I mentioned past life stuff, we began our great biblical debate.  Not all dramatic angry debate, but just &ldquo;why isn&rsquo;t it as clear to you as it is to me?&rdquo; debate.</p>

<p><p>At the very end, Marcel asked me two questions:</p>

<p><p>1) Why do I believe in reincarnation?</p>

<p><p>2) Why don&rsquo;t I believe in reincarnation?</p>

<p><p>Hmmm.</p>

<p><p>1) I believe in reincarnation because of evidence I&rsquo;ve seen/heard/read about it.  There are those who say, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t believe all that you see/hear/read&rdquo; but to that I say, &ldquo;do you believe men have walked on the moon?   Were you there?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I have <em>experienced</em> astral projection.  As real an experience as I now experience myself sitting in this chair typing, I experienced astral projection.  Not like in a dream with weird and wild shapes.  I was in my bed, I woke up without opening my eyes, and I felt myself folded at the hips with my feet hovering over my face.  Just like that.</p>

<p><p>My experience of astral projection (actually I think the correct term in this case is etheric projection) ensures I <em>know</em> I do not need my body in order to survive.  I can survive outside my body.  Therefore I <em>know</em> I have a something (I call it soul) that can live without my body.  I jump to the conclusion that my physical body can die and my soul will live.</p>

<p><p>I have read a book written by a man who disbelieved in past lives until he inadvertantly regressed a woman to her past lives.  <em>Many Lives, Many Masters</em> by Brian L. Weiss.</p>

<p><p>I have experienced synchronicities in my life that simply cannot be attributed to chance.  Just today <em>today!!</em> as I was leaving work, I was thinking about how Lily Roddy is Phil Roddy&rsquo;s new identity (s/he&rsquo;s having a gender change), and how tomorrow I&rsquo;m going to see her for this past life thing.  I started my car and turned on KTRU.  The song lyric was clearly exactly something about a man who changed his physical gender to a woman.  I had never previously heard the song.</p>

<p><p>I have heard many stories about people being regressed to past lives and instantly accessing information they could not have possibly known in their current incarnation: names of dead people, foreign languages, locations of objects..</p>

<p><p>What else?  What else?  I don&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;m tired and losing my thought train.</p>

<p><p>2) Why don&rsquo;t I believe in reincarnation?</p>

<p><p>Because most people have no clear memory of past lives.  Because society says it&rsquo;s not true.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ll write more tomorrow.</p>

<p><p>With Love
<br>- Rob</p>

<p class=date>10:02pm CST Sunday 16 January 2000</p>
<p class=note>(adapted from my diary)</p></p>

<p><p>Friday 14 January 2000 9pm</p>

<p><p>Houston Rally 2000.  Bang we are here after such a short drive!  We in this case = me, kT, and her sister Allison.  Upon arrival, they bounced out of the car and I sat gently munching my chicken sandwich from Sonic.  This is one of the first rallies in a long time that I also didn&rsquo;t bounce out of the car.  Maybe the first ever.</p>

<p><p><hr align="left" width="20%"></p>

<p><p>5:30am 15 Jan 2000</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m so tired.  Sitting by the bathroom = the only light in advisors&rsquo; area.  So so so so much fun watching Jason and Kris at Play (perfect Play with no ego, no plan - just delightful Play) with a big frisbee ring thing.  Micaela and I sat for over an hour watching them, talking to any other youth who happened to sit by us for a moment.</p>

<p><p>Registration was a bit slow as many of them had to be typed into the computer.  Wende spent like 6 or 8 hours at the computer I&rsquo;m guessing as people trickled in from around the district.</p>

<p><p>Jason and I took off for Walgreen&rsquo;s before we registered and got gum for our talent show.  We talked about stock purchases and stuff.  He has a goal to turn $8000 into $25,000 this year.</p>

<p><p><hr align="left" width="20%"></p>

<p><p>5pm Saturday 15 January 2000 (I am 10888 days old today!)</p>

<p><p>Just talked to Bryn, including my intent to phase out of YRUU in April 2001 and attend school in Santa Monica.  Bryn described how she has noticed my change (phasing out) &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not the same Rob that I first met..&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Interesting is that she intends to attend school maybe in California.  &ldquo;Why are you following me, Rob :-)&rdquo; she asks.</p>

<p><p>Double interesting is that she will probably be in Australia in a year.  What if Jason and I could arrange to visit her next summer??  Crazy fun possibilities!</p>

<p><p>Big interesting conflict with Jason and Kris not wanting to pay / register for the rally but finally each paid and all is good.  Jason (and maybe Kris) is conflicted between 18 year old adult status vs give up some rights to attend rally.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m glad he chose to stay; we still get to do our gum talent show thing.  I&rsquo;m thankful for that.</p>

<p><p>YAC meeting has been productive.  We debated a lot on contraband bags.  My idea was to just keep it simple and put them in each car where the youth rode.  YAC is trying to take on too much and solve all possible problems with it.  The whole idea is to help make it easier for the smokers to ditch their cigarettes and not smoke during the weekend.  However, there was some concern about liability and whatever with where to put the bags.</p>

<p><p>Played a stomping game of Ultimate where basically Sean (sp), Patrick and I crushed the other team 10 to 0.  Not entirely fun but okay because the other team was not willing to trade players and spirits stayed happy.</p>

<p><p><hr align="left" width="20%"></p>

<p><p>5:15am 10889 days old Sunday 16 January 2000</p>

<p><p>Big fun sittin&rsquo; out at table with Jason, Kris, Micaela, while we did not attend the worship.  We instead talked smack about rap/hip hop and Kris did his impression of the &ldquo;107.3 106.9 the Blaze&rdquo; audio tagline at the new station in Tyler.</p>

<p><p>Me and Jason talent show was well received and worth the wait (the original idea was before Tulsa rally in June).  We started with a few Chicklets, describing how they could be used to help smokers not smoke.  Added a double bubble, added Rug Rats cartoon gum, added paint by numbers gum, added some Tear Jerker Sour Balls gum, added some bunjee gum, added 6 feet of bubble tape, some band aid gum&hellip; Hugemongous giant wad of gum in the end super saturated with sugar and drooling with saliva, almost choking with monstrosity.  So so so ridiculously funny.  We didn&rsquo;t have a good ending <em>per se</em> but just kinda got up as some other gum seeking youth pounced on the stage to scavenge through the pile of unused gum we dropped.</p>

<p><p>The rest of the talent show was poetry and stuff and Rocky Raccoon sung my Steve but played on guitar by Kris, as Steve broke his arm bicycling.  Also, Nancy did her duck/bar/grapes/nail joke.</p>

<p><p>And to top it off for me, Jason wrote/improvised a song for me.  Something with chorus &ldquo;I want to grow old with you.&rdquo;  So perfect.  So touching.  Thank you, Jason.</p>

<p><p>Then:  Silent Football.  Good game, about 15 players, many of them were new to it.  Nathan lost due to extaneous sloppiness.  Although, I did give him 4 penance points for brining in two players (4 penance points out of 5 to lose didn&rsquo;t give him much room to work with), including Nancy who didn&rsquo;t know the rules.</p>

<p><p>The game was pretty close.  Two other players had 4.5 points when Nathan lost.  Props to Daniel who kept playing hard and dramatically got better during the game.</p>

<p><p><hr align="left" width="20%"></p>

<p><p>10:39pm Sunday 16 January 2000</p>

<p><p>Sean (who played Ultimate with me) greatly thanked me for Silent Football!  He was inspired to bring it back to his church.  Yay!!</p>

<p><p>Closing was nice, lots of peeps out in the parking lot after stuff was cleaned - just talking and hugging and taking pictures.  Closing circle included smashing a wall of shoeboxes as a symbolic &ldquo;breaking down the walls.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Drove kT and Allison to their home, then I went to Wende&rsquo;s and slept.  Ironically, I locked her gate key in her house so she can&rsquo;t get in to her complex.  We&rsquo;ll try in the morning.</p>

<p class=date>6:31pm Friday 14 January 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Rally this weekend!  And I haven&rsquo;t been in charge at all!  So weird.  I
haven&rsquo;t packed at all!  That&rsquo;s not so weird.</p>

<p><p>I think FINALLY Jason will be at a rally with me so we can do our bubble
gum skit, which I am sure will be more funny to people who are there than
people who don&rsquo;t see it, and probably more funny to Jason and I than anyone
else at all.  Basically, it involves Jason and I chewing as much gum as we
possibly can all at once.  We&rsquo;ll each start with a single sliver of Big
League Chew.</p>

<p><p>Today at work I am still inventorying machines, but mostly playing
around.  I haven&rsquo;t been able to log much time lately.</p>

<p><p>Have not been able to get the durn stinkeen modem to work on Deb&rsquo;s
machine!  We&rsquo;ve tried a couple of different modems, and actually three
different machines.  I can hardly imagine what we&rsquo;re doing &lsquo;wrong&rsquo;.</p>

<p><p>Okay, dassit.  Have a great weekend!!</p>

<p><p>With Love
<br>- Rob</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m <a 
href="/cgi-local/reviews.cgi?file=54CrawlingWithTarts.txt">reviewing</a> a
CD called <em>I am Telephoning A Star</em> by Crawling With Tarts.  Quite
odd, noise-ridden wacked out stuff.  Good for the show Genetic Memory on
KTRU.</p>

<p><p>Got my car back from the shop this morning!  Scott has 2 new engine
mounts and new radiator now for $617.  $618 more and he can get new power
steering!</p>

<p><p>Worked on installing a new modem today.  Should be a piece of cake, but
the PnP (Plug and Pray) Microsoft BS wasn&rsquo;t working.  So I got an ISA modem
and was able to get it installed.</p>

<p><p>Yesterday Wende and I went to see Suzanne!  She&rsquo;s my ex-downstairs
neighbor of 6 or 7 years, who moved out a couple years ago.  We helped her
set up her new computer and got paid in ice cream from Baskin Robbins!!!</p>

<p><p>Had to wear shoes today at work; we&rsquo;re having a guest type person visit
to see how secure our place is.</p>

<p><p>Very likely I&rsquo;ll go skating tonight!  I haven&rsquo;t been in SO Long!!</p>

                        <p><title>SKATE!!</title>
<p class=date>11:07pm Thursday 13 January 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Started as we normally do on Thursday nights, meeting at Texas Art
Supply (very close to my house)  This night, only Scott and I showed
up.  I was quite excited to skate, and a bit glad that it was only he
and I; I haven&rsquo;t been out in so long that I didn&rsquo;t want to hold back a
big group.</p>

<p><p>We set out toward downtown, and within 2 blocks, my legs were
burning.  <em>oh no</em> I thought, <em>this is going to be a short
night.</em>  I was really sucking wind by the time we crested the hill
on Taft as it approaches Allen Parkway.  I certainly didn&rsquo;t barrel down
it this night, but just enjoyed the gravitational assist going down the
hill.</p>

<p><p>By the time we got to downtown (two miles), however, my normal
endurance was nearly back.  I&rsquo;m not sure how that happened, but I
certainly appreciated my legs not screaming anymore.</p>

<p><p>We skated down some trails along Buffalo Bayou that I had never
previously skated.  They were nice and smooth, and okay for hills.
(When I first started skating 6 years ago they would have been Great
hills, but now they&rsquo;re just okay.)</p>

<p><p>To Brewery Tap, where we popped in for a second but found no skaters,
and continued our trek toward UH Downtown.  The hill up Main Street got
me pretty well winded again; I had to sit down or I would have fainted
at the top.  (I thought <em>wouldn&rsquo;t it suck if I was leaning over the
wall and fainted and fell off&hellip;</em>.. So I sat down)</p>

<p><p>Upon my recovery, we skated down the other side of the hill and
underneath the school, into the lower level parking garage, up an
elevator to inside the building and got some water from the fountain.</p>

<p><p>The halls were deserted (winter break), and lovely smoooooth
marble/granite tile stuff.  Very nice.  Skated outside and found
ourselves back at the top of the hill where I had previously not toppled
over the wall to my demise.</p>

<p><p>Instead, we skated down it really fast.  I taught Scott how I time
the light for it to be green once I reach the bottom, and we proceeded
once the time was right.  Zzzzoooommmmm!!!!   lovely zzzzz zzzzzz zzzzzz
sound as each skate pushed on the grooved pavement.  Light turned green
and I sailed through the intersection at the bottom.  Still not enough
speed for me.  Hmmm.</p>

<p><p>Over to George R Brown Convention Center, and <em>big</em> unexpected
tents filled the parking lot!!  The Circus??   Yes!  Ringling Brothers
and Barnum and Bailey Circus in tents that I decided were smaller than I
might have expected..  We tried to get in (not very enthusiastically) at
all three entrances, but were politely declined entry.  Ended up talking
to a professional skater guy who skates in the circus.  That&rsquo;s pretty
cool.</p>

<p><p>Back toward home, we found ourselves down by Buffalo Bayou again, but
on the other side.  We came to a barrier in the sidewalk.  On the right
was the bayou, and on the left was a 45 degree rough concrete incline
which I scaled on all fours about 40 feet up to the top.  Scott did the
same, but on the grass along the side.  Then on my third attempt, I was
able to jump/climb/scramble up and over a 5 foot vertical wall.  Scott
took his skates off to climb over.</p>

<p><p>Toward home and where I wanted to turn right, Scott wnted to go
straight through 4th Ward.  We&rsquo;ve skated through it before with no
problems, but I&rsquo;m always a tad nervous.  This night, after Scott had to
kinda bail off the street to keep from getting squished by a car, I
skated past a kid about 16 years old, who underhand-tossed a little
tightly wound piece of paper or a cigarette butt up at me and said,
&ldquo;what&rsquo;s up officer?&rdquo; as I whizzed by.  It hit me above the eye, but I
just ignored him and brushed my forehead like removing a drop of sweat.
Nothing else significant happened.</p>

<p><p>Puhed the last couple of blocks to Texas Art Supply, where I streched
while Scott took off his skates.</p>

<p><p>Oh!! That totally reminds me.  I told him about Fred and unicycle and
stuff and Scott had the best idea for learning how to ride!  A shopping
cart!!  It&rsquo;s the correct height; it rolls; it&rsquo;s sturdy.. perfect!  Scott
has a unicyle that I may borrow from him on Tuesday.</p>

<p><p>Yay!</p>

<p><p>With Love
<br>- Rob</p>

<p class=date>1:40pm Wednesday 12 January 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Wende joined me at KTRU today!  Mostly she just browsed through our
stacks, finding the perfect set of music to play.  &ldquo;The Wende Set&rdquo; I
dubbed it, but had to interrupt it to play my required number of
playlist tracks.</p>

<p><p>I had only 3 callers during the 3 hour show, and one asked if I could
mention his band &ldquo;23&rdquo; with &ldquo;Bickley&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mr Plow&rdquo; (named after a
Simpsons episode) playing at Fitzgerald&rsquo;s on the 15th.  I announced it
after I played &ldquo;Mr Plow&rdquo; medley on <em>The Simpsons Go Simpsonic</em>
CD!!</p>

<p><p>A different fun request was for Tuscadero&rsquo;s song &ldquo;Nancy Drew.&rdquo;  Sixty
seconds later, it was on the air. &ldquo;<em>That</em> is why I love KTRU so
much!&rdquo; I exclaimed over the air after the song finished.  &ldquo;If I can find
a request, <em>bang</em>, it&rsquo;s on the air!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>The next request for DJ Bill something I could not find.</p>

<p><p>After KTRU, Wende and I grabbed pizza at Bambolino&rsquo;s and now we&rsquo;re
munchin.</p>
