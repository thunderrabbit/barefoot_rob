                        <p class=date>Thursday 27 November 1997</p>

<p><b>Happy Thanksgiving!!</b></p>

<p>I just got back from skating all around the Thanksgiving Day Parade
in downtown Houston.  I started at a lazy 10:00 in the am, strapped on
skates and skated all the way down Dallas Street toward downtown.  As
I approached, a small fragmented crowd of parents and kids and baby
strollers dispersed away from where I knew the parade must be.  Was it
over already??</p>

<p>I was certain it was certainly not, so I continued until I found
that half the parade had ended, and the other half was slowly catching
up. I skated upstream along the sidewalk behind the crowd, watching
the marchers, twirlers, dancers, floats, giant balloons, clowns, more
marchers, a guy on one of those old timey big wheel bicycles, and to
end it all, some low rider cars and trucks with hydraulics, neon
lights, chrome, plush velvet interiors and bumpin' bass for the whole
crowd to enjoy.</p>

<p>I had missed the skaters... sigh..</p>

<p>As the crowd flooded the street behind the cop cars behind the low
riders, I scooted to the other side of the parade to skate upstream
till I caught up with the end of the route.  One band was playing that
Dr Who song: "Dr Whooooo... (YEAH!)  Dr Who.  Dr Whoooo... (YEAH!) Dr
Who" and on and on.  I joined the crowd cheering the (YEAH!) part.</p>

<p>Once I reached the front-most part of the parade at the end of the
route, I skated around to get a closer look (in daylight this time) at
the floats Jim and I had seen last night.  They were pretty cool,
especially since I could see the hinges, cables, rods, and all the
technology behind the magic.</p>

<p>I went over the check out the big balloons that were being
deflated. At one balloon were some guys grouped around a vent,
breathing the helium and talking in chipmunk voices.  That was pretty
funny, especially when one squeaked, "it's-a-dream-come-true!"  I
chose not to inhale such a percentage of helium (though I'm not sure
the prevailing ingredients in Houston air are much better), especially
when the guys started going, "oh.. whoah.. that's enough of
that..."</p>

<p>I followed my nose toward Sam Houston Park and found the Urban
Animals!  They are the local big skate group, and the ones that skated
in the parade.  I said HI to John M, who owns the Montrose Skate Shop
from which I purchase all my skating stuff, and he grabbed my frisbee
and we started playing!  The crazy thing was that all the Urban Animal
dudes and dudettes played frisbee wearing their skates in the grass,
making for clumsy (although sometimes impressive) catches, and a few
spills.  I played barefoot of course, despite Greg hollering, "Hey!!
you gotta wear skates!"  I hollered, "no way, man!!" and mentally
hollered "gimme my frisbee back!"</p>

<p>We played for like 20 minutes until they all got tired and I played
with the younger kids who were there.  One girl looked about 6 years
old and she could catch and throw pretty consistently well!  I was
impressed.  Finally they all left and I put on my skates and just
bummed around a bit to see what I could see.</p>

<p>I saw basically nothin' so I zooomed at super top full speed ahead
down the hill leading to Allen Parkway.  That was pretty fun so I did
it again after catching my breath.</p>

<p>The second time I kept skating down Allen Parkway toward home.
Once I got to the intersection at Taft, where I needed to turn left
across Allen Parkway, I was zip zip zipping in a large left turn and
almost slipped crunch as a car was approaching with a more rapid pace
than I would really enjoy being hit by a car.  With that incentive, I
did *not* fall, and scurried the rest of the way across to safety.</p>

<p>The rest of the journey home I spent in slow deliberate
contemplation about the virtues of skating safely.</p>

                        <p class=date>27 November 1997</p>

<p>Last night Jim E and I embarked on our Third Annual Thanksgiving
Eve Skate.  He got to my house at like 9:30pm (after my dad and I saw
<em>Alien Resurrection</em> with Sigourney Weaver; it wasn't that
super great of a movie; see it at matinee price.) and we drove to
downtown to begin our adventure.</p>

<p>Once on skates, we cruised down to Jones Plaza where there were
many buses full of performers who had just practiced their dance
routines for the parade.  Down the hill by Jones Plaza I picked up
speed and then slide between the parked buses like a mouse through a
tall but simple maze.  I was only slightly worried about people
stepping off the buses through the doors that were all open.</p>

<p>We emerged in front of the buses without incident and Jim asked one
of the motorcycle cops if they needed help escorting the buses out.
The cop was all laffin' "yeah, that'd be great."</p>

<p>Jim and I got many waves from the passengers as we waved and
hollered at them as they went by.  I chased the last bus for a few
blocks until they were moving entirely too fast for me to keep up.</p>

<p>We skated then to our favorite parking lot to play frisbee, and
much to our astonishment, there were cars parked in our lot!!!  We
said HI to the valet dudes who were there and they said Wednesday
through Saturday they would be parking cars there in the evening.  I
couldn't believe it!  cars in our frisbee lot!!</p>

<p>Up the hill leading to UH Downtown, and enjoyed the view of the
bayou and railroad tracks and jailhouse.  Then I picked up major speed
down the other side and found it a fun challenge to turn without
braking and without getting smooshed by an oncoming truck.  The truck
was oncoming really close to me, but I still had to watch out for it.
Jim used his brake most of the way down the hill so the truck had
passed before it mattered.  His only concern was the few stairs that
were at the bottom of the sidewalk!  Fortunately, he just zipped
straight over them and just dropped down the few feet to street level.
(I think I'd like to try that sometime!)</p>

<p>We purposely climbed down a few more steps so we could speed down
the sidewalk leading down along the bayou.  I went first, and didn't
use my brake, so I was on full alert as I sped down around a slowly
curving blind corner.  Yikes!!!  Mud ahead!  There was a teeny clear
section on the left of the mud, through which I zipped, then
immediately stopped and turned around to warn Jim before he might hit
the mud and mess up his skates.  I was worried that I might get
smushed by him as *he* sped around the blind corner, but fortunately
the timing worked out perfectly and disaster was avoided.  Shew!!</p>

<p>That was fun..  :)</p>

<p>We rolled slowly along the rest of the sidewalk between the bayou
and jail, then up the stairs where Jim happily greeted the guys
standing out in front of the building.  I felt a bit uncomfortable,
but I didn't want to *act* like a felt uncomfortable, so I just skated
in gentle circles until Jim was done conversing, which didn't take
very long because they weren't too talkative.</p>

<p>Then we skated up to the George R Brown Convention Center where we
had found the floats last year.  I told Jim about what kinda stuff I
have on my webpages, and the conversation turned to me describing
stories about Thunder Rabbit.  I might just be inspired to write some
more.</p>

<p>At the GRBCC, we found the floats again.  There were three out in a
parking lot and four inside the building.  They had the standard big
turkey one with spinning tail feathers, and the rest were really cool:
<br>One had a Santa Claus rocketship sleigh rocketing out from about a 15 foot diameter model earth;
<br>another had something else;
<br>another had huge ornate clocks surrounding a head of Grandfather Time;
<br>and another had a huge wheel of long brass musical horns that would spin like the turkey's tail feathers.</p>

<p>After we got kicked out of the building, and saw everything in the
parking lot, we skated and played frisbee in a different parking lot
across from the Center.</p>

<p>There was a light wind, which made throwing more interesting as I
skated a huge circle around Jim and we tossed the disc back and
forth. We both made a few cool catches and cool throws.  After about
20 minutes I was pretty tired.</p>

<p>We wound our way through the quiet streets back to where we parked
by Fuzzy's and chilled for a bit before taking off skates and heading
home.</p>

                        <p class=date>weekend of 21-23 November 1997</p>

<p><p>
This weekend we had our Construct-O-Con planning rally for the
full blown rally in January.<br />
Anna M, Charlotte B, Christina L, Jason F, Jim M, Jon M, Jon W, KT H, Nick C, Rob N and Wende W were all there for most of the weekend.
<p>
We were way more productive than I had expected. The first night we got the theme figured out: &ldquo;Imagine The Cat in the Hat (burning the flag)&rdquo;  (or something like that.) (Last year we didn&rsquo;t even start planning until 5pm Saturday.) We wanted an imagination-provoking theme, and one of the main speakers will be discussing First Amendment rights, including (but not necessarily encouraging) the right to burn the US flag.
<p>
The next day, we hammered out the schedule and disbursed the various tasks to those who were present.  I look forward to a super great rally with these guys.
<p>
Though we were dragging by the end of Saturday, we got the T-Shirt design completed, and it was all good.
<p>
Also during the weekend, we play much hackey sack, listened to Jason&rsquo;s bump while playing frisbee, watched 3 or 4 movies, including <em>Brain Candy</em> (which we watched at last year&rsquo;s Construct-O-Con), <em>Mars Attacks</em>, and a freaky stop action animation film by Frank Zappa, which was mostly clay animation, and I was amazed at the detail they created, especially for such a long movie!  It was pretty incredible.
<p>
Sunday morning we cleaned up and got up.  I&rsquo;m thankful for Wende who was much better at describing to the LRY group (who were mostly not at the lock-in) about the joy of rallies and designing them and all that.<br>
Next rally is Little Rock Rally 5-007 December 1997</p>

Cool!  Just this morning I was listening to <a href=https://www.krbe.com>krbe</a> on the radio, and the DJ was all, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t have a copy of Young MC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Busta Move&rdquo;&rdquo; and I was all, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it!&rdquo;  And I played it for them over the phone and on the air and they were all singin&rsquo; and dancin&rsquo; and basically goin crazy with it.<p>
And they gave me tickets to Astroworld!  Yay!!
<p>
I went in to the station to pick up my tickets, and after a few minutes, I got to go back to the broadcasting studio and be on the air!  Totally fabulous and Sam Malone and I were jokin&rsquo; a bit about how we could go on tour&hellip; &ldquo;it&rsquo;d be two white guys,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;trying to bust a move on tour.&rdquo;  Silly wacky stuff. Then as I was leaving, he&rsquo;s all, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re gonna give you Rockets Tickets
and you can be in the 104 KRBE Suite!&rdquo;  YES!!
<p>
Out of the studio, Chuck was about to sign me up for the tickets, and I said, &ldquo;hey, uh I can&rsquo;t go to the Rockets game..&rdquo;  He was all, &ldquo;um, okay.. I&rsquo;m not sure what other tickets we have..&rdquo; and them someone was like, &ldquo;we might have some U2 tickets.&rdquo;<p>
My eyes and face lit up.  <b>&ldquo;YES!&rdquo;</b><p>
I got two U2 tickets, which went on sale in April for the concert 28 November, and normally cost 75 bucks each!!!<p>
<b>YES!!!!</b></p>

<p><p>
This weekend changed my life.
<p>
When I first heard about <a href=https://www.mkp.org>New Warrior Training</a> I was quite not interested.  Some kind of initiation into manhood&hellip; and I wanted nothing to do with it.  That was two years ago.
<p>
The reason I wanted nothing to do with it:  I was afraid of men.<br>
I certainly didn&rsquo;t want to become a man.  And I doubly certaintly didn&rsquo;t want to be associated with men and known as a man.  No way.
<p>
Almost a year ago I attended a New Warrior graduation ceremony.
<br>
The men I saw on stage were not too scary.  They were acting as real humans, with feelings, and expressing their emotions.<br>
Hmmmm.<br>
Maybe it&rsquo;s not so bad after all.
<p>
After I attended a second graduation, I knew I wanted to do it.
<p>
I called my dad and asked if he had ever heard of it.
<p>
&ldquo;Yep!  And I&rsquo;ve signed up for the weekend in August!&rdquo;
<p>
Wow.  I was actually kinda jealous, but really happy for him.
<p>
My weekend was this weekend. It really changed my life, but as I write this, I recognize I don&rsquo;t wish to share all the details with the world (even though this site gets so few hits per day&hellip;)<p>
But I learned a few things:<p>
<ul>
<li>I can trust men and survive.</li>
<li>Without realizing it, I have grown to be a man.</li>
<li>There is still a lot more to learn.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

A few days ago I paid bills. My medical bill sticks out like a sore thumb among all the rest.  It&rsquo;s $3853.  I have paid off all my other debt, but I didn&rsquo;t want to pay off my medical bill because it doesn&rsquo;t charge interest and who cares, anyway?
<p>
I consulted my runes.  I had decided if I choose a rune upright, I would pay a significant portion of my debt, and just do it. I chose a rune in its upright position, but I can&rsquo;t seem to remember which one it was.<br />
<p>
I paid $2000 and felt good but with a tinge of loss.
<p>
A couple days later I got a check in the mail for $677.  Not 2 grand, but wow.  I thought it was pretty cool.

<p><p>
Tonight was our Souper Salad hangout dinner and it was crazy!!
<p>
I misunderstood exactly where it was located, and I parked closer to San Felipe than to Westheimer. I just figured it was right around the corner so I walked.<br>
It wasn&rsquo;t toooo far, only 2 city blocks, but it made me a bit late.
<p>
As I approached, I could see kT and Jon crouched on the floor, peeking out the windows at me. Jon snuck out in an attempt to ambush me, but I saw him and kept some parked cars between us and ran toward the door and inside, to find kT and Dennis huddled in mock fear by the front counter. <em>Oh my goodness this is going to be a crazy night.</em><p>
I couldn&rsquo;t figure out what to say to them; I turned without a word and got my tray. They jumped up laffin&rsquo;
<p>
They were just silly this night! This was our waiter&rsquo;s first night, so they harrassed him well, even to the point of embarassing <em>me</em> by clonking their cups together and on the table to indicate they were still without water.
<p>
Maggie and Wende arrived late, and we all had a great time.  The manager was quite chill about the antics at our table, even when kT and Dennis had salt and pepper wars with me, and even after our meal when we ate sugar out of the packets.
<p>
Jon was the last to leave, and I told him about Thunder Rabbit and a new surprise.

After doin&rsquo; almost nothin&rsquo; at work yesterday, I got more accomplished today.
<p>
The files that the new Invoice Service uses are simply too abundant, so we have to archive them into .zip files. We don&rsquo;t have the zip source code, so my code has to make a system call to a batch job to extract the desired file.
<p>
I made a little test program today that does just that.  Perfect!

Today at church we discussed the next few upcoming events:
<ul>
<li>Wednesday Night LRY Hangout Dinner at Souper Salad</li>
<li>I won&rsquo;t be here next weekend 14-16 November</li>
<li>Construct-O-Con Lock-In at Emerson church 21-23 November</li>
<li>Little Rock Rally 5-007 December</li>
</ul>
<p>
I encouraged them to attend as many of these fun events as possible!
<p>
One weird thing: Amber was in attendance at our meeting, and I was certain I had seen her before.  Turns out she was at the San Antonio Rally <b>last</b> weekend.  Woah!

<p><p>
I have hibernated in my apartment this entire weekend. I&rsquo;ve been sleeping about two-thirds of the time and doing a bit of writing in The PIN.
<p>
My sleep has been sporadic; once I woke up hacking and gagging on phlegm and snot and bluh.  I locked myself in the bathroom and took a hot shower until all the hot water was gone.<br>
Some of my dreams are lucid; I don&rsquo;t recall any out-of-body excursions.
<p>
I definitely had to skip Ultimate tonight.  Unfortunately, I&rsquo;ll be skipping it the next two weeks, and I have already skipped it the past two weeks.  Nuts.
<p>
Interestingly, Wende is gone this entire weekend, from Friday morning to Monday evening.  Apparently, this is time for me to take care of myself.  I&rsquo;ve enjoyed it.
<p>
I plan to be well enough to attend church tomorrow.
