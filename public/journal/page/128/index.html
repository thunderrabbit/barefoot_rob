<p>Howdy</p>

<p>I will be presenting at Pecha Kucha on 24 November.</p>

<p>I hate the idea of presenting; part of me wants to cancel everything,
but I hope to see some of you on Thursday November 24th at SuperDeluxe
in Roppongi.</p>

<li>Rob</li>
</ul>

<p>In other news, I&rsquo;m planning to present Head Heart and Soul to anyone
who wants a sense of what the men&rsquo;s group work is about.</p>

<p>In other news, I&rsquo;m scheduled to be filmed in mid December for TV show
to air in late December.</p>

<p>I gotta prep and part of me fears I&rsquo;ll sabotage it all.</p>

<p class="dream">
My dragon arrived, and it was much larger than expcected! I helped the
UPS driver deliver it. There were a few light things but then some
pieces we had to carry together.  First was a large mirror, though it
was covered in fabric.  The tires were like truck tires which I
suggested a game to roll up the driveway together.  She agreed after
realizing I would help carry things, and wasn't just fooling around.
</p>

<p class="dream">
The dragon playground had a working toilet, but I hadn't planned to
install plumbing because I didn't know about it.  The driver thought
it would be good if someone with kids had bought the dragon, but I
told her we don't have kids; the dragon was for me.

<p>While taking a bath, I just talked to Fred for 45+ minutes on the
phone, rubber ducking a problem with him.</p>

<p>Before I started working on this a couple days ago, I did the
following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Save a list of indices each time the user tweaks a search on index</li>
<li>Once a record is selected, use the indices to allow prev/next</li>
<li>Rerun the search if they go back to the index</li>
</ol>

<p>This worked fine at first, but item #1 above now takes too much time
now that the DB has grown.</p>

<p>So my new idea was the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Save the query as user tweaks the search on index</li>
<li>Once a record is selected, run the query with LIMIT / OFFSET to
allow prev/next</li>
<li>Rerun the query if they go back to the index</li>
</ol>

<p>This makes #1 faster in that I don&rsquo;t have to save all the indices.  It
makes #2 slower in that I run the query each time, but oh well.</p>

<p>However, after talking to Fred, I realize #2 is flawed much more
deeply.  If a record is selected, then edited such that the query
won&rsquo;t find it, then the prev/next will get borked.</p>

<p>So, here&rsquo;s the solution I&rsquo;ve decided to do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Save the query as user tweaks the search on index</li>
<li>Once a record is selected, use the query to create a list of
indices for the query and save them to disk</li>
<li>Use the list of indices to allow prev/next</li>
<li>Use the query only if they go back to the index</li>
</ol>

<p>This way, #2 can be run while the initial record is loading, which
will take a bit of time, but I intend to run it asynchronously so it
won&rsquo;t really affect the load time, except for prev/next buttons.</p>

<p>Thanks, Fred!</p>

<p>Lin and I watched
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magic_of_Belle_Isle">The Magic of Belle Isle</a>
on Netflix tonight; it was lovely and touching.  I didn&rsquo;t like the
grouchy characters at first, but the character arcs were beautiful.
Yes, it&rsquo;s a simple story on the surface, but it&rsquo;s got stories within
stories and layers upon layers.</p>

<p>My group lesson had only one student; I suggested <a href="https://newsinlevels.com">https://newsinlevels.com</a> and
<a href="https://breakingnewsenglish.com">https://breakingnewsenglish.com</a> as ways she can practice extensive reading.
There are probably some free sites that are actually geared toward ER,

new teacher.</p>

<p>Sweet; I&rsquo;ve got my refactored code nearly complete.  I just need to
snag a copy of the number of records.  I know the data already exists
in DataTables; I just need to pick it up from there or maybe I already
have it server-side somewhere.</p>

<p>I was told that Western Union could send money directly to my bank
account. It&rsquo;s a new service they offer.</p>

<p>Except when I tried to send money to my bank account in the US, I was
told I&rsquo;d have to go to the US to get it.</p>

<p>Ahem.</p>

<p>I bitched at them and they changed the recipient, but still, smells
like false advertising or crappy internal communication (&ldquo;we don&rsquo;t
have that service, sir&rdquo;) or something.</p>
