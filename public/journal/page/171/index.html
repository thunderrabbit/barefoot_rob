<p class="dream">Making a copy of Tariq's data, I noted a pattern of full backups and
partial backups, so I was able to go back a week to get the most
recent full backup.  The current backup was going to be a full backup,
but it was aborted before it finished.
</p>

<p class="dream">Later, he and I were walking to the train station, and after I crossed
the street, I was like, "hey Tariq over here!" and he turned to follow
and was suddenly hit by a car like blam and instantly dead =
dismembered into blobs of white fat and two wooden egg shapes which
had been his eyes.</p>

<p class="dream">I had a sense that it couldn't be real, but didn't wake up. I was
shocked, and I feared it was my fault, as I had called to him, and he
was killed when he turned to follow me.  Riding in his dad's car, I
called Lin and told her "Tariq is dead!" and also wanted his dad to
understand, so I switched to Japanese "Tariq が死んだ!" and he took
notice and we drove to the location where there was a police vehicle
nearby so we directed him to the scene where some people were picking
up the blobs of fat.  I was too distraught to do anything.
</p>

<p class="dream">
Walking with some people in a new neighborhood, I realized they looked
like gang members, featuring big tattoos, spikey hair, knuckles,
jackets.  I spoke to the toughest looking one and said, "to be honest,
I feel a bit of fear around you guys, even though I know you're just a
bunch of guys.. Your outward appearance reminds me of some stories
I've heard about gang violence."
</p>

<p class="dream">
They were like, "well why don't you come with us?" and more fear came
up in me as they took me into a room.  I realized I was dreaming, but
didn't come fully out of it until I stated the intention that only
good things will happen in my dreams.
</p>

<p>And I woke up out of the dream</p>

<p>Tonight was the second open I-group in Tokyo, and it went quite well.
I posed the question &ldquo;what would you change in your personal life if
you could change anything?&rdquo; and looked in detail at some of the
answers. I now have a nice plan for how to be a better husband/partner
with Lin.</p>

<p>Super great meeting!</p>

<p>Have lots of fun new things to write and a much better sense of what
we need to write for the new user-type who will be able to log in to
the system.</p>

<p>And finally Nate sent the invoice for the year.  So they had a bunch
of questions which I was fortunately able to answer.</p>

<p>D&rsquo;oh!  HAhaha I tried out survival mode after giving myself a kick ass
diamond sword and 32 spawned skeletons.  They nearly killed me, and
then a creeper finished me off, plus destroyed a small section of
roller coaster.  hahah oops!  I think I repaired it in a way that all
the previously linked tracks are linked again.  I tested one track and
it seemed correct.</p>

<p>Lin&rsquo;s like &ldquo;it&rsquo;s shiny and they said it works great!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.. ummm..  maybe you&rsquo;d be more likely to make the
right choice if you actually use the phone (a lot more), first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So we&rsquo;re doing that now.  kinda.</p>

<h2 id="15-32">15:32</h2>

<p>Though Lin gave all her infos, and the clerk scanned both the phone
and the sim card as having been selected, we didn&rsquo;t buy anything.</p>

<p>On the way to buy ice cream and think about the phone options, Lin
noticed her work phone wasn&rsquo;t where she thought it would be.  I
guessed she had left it at home so zoomed home on my bike and found it
on her desk.</p>

<h2 id="15-36">15:36</h2>

<p>Yay! She called her current provider, and they beat the price Lin was
offered today.  Nice.</p>

<p>After scoping the land in Okutama, Lin and I went to her sister&rsquo;s
place and enjoyed musical entertainment provided by her niece and
nephews.  Mikarin plays several instruments piano, xylophone,
saxophone, recorder, (more?), and she played for us, including some of
her own compositions.</p>

<p>Lin and I went to Okutama to chill and look at some land.  It&rsquo;s on
sale for a mere(?) $60,000&hellip; but it apparently doesn&rsquo;t get much
sunlight.  There are plenty of hills in the area, being that it&rsquo;s in
the mountains, but by the time we live there, I&rsquo;m sure self driving
cars will be the norm.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re on a train that goes from Okutama to Tokyo station, so it&rsquo;s a
single line (and we have seats), but it takes more than a few minutes
to travel the distance.</p>
