<p>Didn't get any pictures of this little sushi shop, but we had the
place (and the attention of two women) while we ate and worked to
communicate.   We ended up eating 8 different types of sushi, hand
made, on the spot.  6300 yen.</p>

<p>They were really nice, the sushi really yummy, the bar really small
and cute with thick natural wooden counter.  I don't know how it
resists water and stains.</p>

<p>I didn't write about October 3rd on the 3rd, because I left my
computer at the hotel, but writable things happened.</p>

<p>It all started at Ginkakuji, where I saw two European women who
didn't speak English.  I wondered why I can't *not* speak English and
began a downward spiral of feeling useless, esp. with being in a
foreign country, but for goodness sakes teaching English and living
with English roommates!  That's no way to learn a language (and I've
ranted about this before) but fuckin' hell it's really true.  I tell
my students the best way to learn English is to get the fuck out of
Japan and when you're there, don't talk to Japanese.  Am I heeding
that advice?  No.</p>

<p>But then janette is like, "so, *why* really do you want to learn
another language?  (3 more by 2010)?"</p>

<p>Good question.  Because I'm embarassed to know only English, and I
think people who know more than one language are really really cool.
*I* want to be really really cool.  That's one thing I really don't
like about the US: only learning one language.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Okay, but am I settled?  Not really.  Am I cool yet?  Not in my
mind.</p>

<p>I kept wondering what Eminem would say ("you've got one shot") and
I fuckin' saw an Eminem lookalike on the mountain.  I thought about
Kim who said I like to build my own rules out of the tools I'm given.
And if I can create the tools, so much the better.  (( Then why the
hell am I working at Nova where all the rules and tools are enforced
upon us? I should be teaching English incidentally, not primarily.
Okay, Nova was just a way to get me into Japan.  If I don't cook up
something big and different in 6 months, I'm out of here (failed)
))</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>She asked me what are the anchors in my life.   I came up with the
following list:</p>

<p><li><p>Water</p></li>
<li><p>Website</p></li>
<li><p>Travel</p></li>
<li><p>Close friendships</p></li>
<li><p>Physical closeness (hugging, sex)</p></li></p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I imagined different types of lives for myself</p>

<p>crap I keep changing this as I write it from what I said yesterday.</p>

<p>One dimension is money related (make money doing something I love,
or making money in a rut-job, or live moochingly)</p>

<p>(dimension of travel: stay put or move move move)</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I want to do something huge for the world.  I've got this idea of
bringing mkp(*) to Japan (why do I think that is huge for the world?
Because in my imagination it could change the face of Japanese
culture.   Gotta keep track of this imagination in my mind. I have a
preconceived idea of what amazingness could happen if I bring mkp
over, and if I don't change the face of Japan, then I could feel like
a failure again, even though I've done something pretty big.) and I
wonder how exactly to do that.</p>

<p>I'm going to write to the author of Dogs and Demons.  I'm going to
write a volley to Kim to discuss my idea.  (That will actually be
first, before I start going bigtime.)  Within a few months, big good
things will be happening.</p>

<p>(*) mkp = <a href="https://www.mkp.org">Mankind Project</a></p>

<p>ps: we saw some cool stuff: Ginkakuji and Kyoumizu</p>

<p class=date>11:37am JST Sunday 5 October 2003</p>

<p>Okay, here are the three things I outlined for janette a couple days ago.</p>

<p>1) live in a place, making money in a job (like living in
Tsunashima and working at Nova) (I know how to do this; I've done it
in various places with various jobs)</p>

<p>2) live in a place, not really making money, but mooching (like
living at janette's and just helping her around the house and reading
Stranger In A Strange Land, etc every night)</p>

<p>3) live not in a specific place, making money somehow while I
travel.  This one seems more elusive to me.  What product or service
can I produce or perform while traveling?  Travel writer?  Ad hoc beat
boxer?  Truman Show star?  Webcam on my helmet, writing my journal
daily, riding my bike across wild places, sleeping in a new place
every night?  (That one sounds fucking awesome to me)</p>

<p>October 3rd may have been the day that we happened upon an unmarked
free toilet when janette needed one and I had no idea where to find
one nor where we were really.</p>

<p>"yo daw, there's a toilet."  I pointed to a private residence by
which we were walking.</p>

<p>Her "reeally?"  Sounded like two things: she couldn't believe it, and
she really really wanted it to be true.  The effect of this sound upon
my heart was <em>oh my gosh I'm glad I wasn't joking.</em></p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>After that, we found a temple from the back, one with a long set of
gates leading from a neighborhood to the temple up some hill.  We
climbed it, sat on a bench, "welp, we made it! (wherever we are, we
are here.)" and then went down a different direction and found
ourselves near Kyoto University.</p>

<p class=dream>In the restroom, sitting on the john at work when Guy
came in and sat on the throne across from me.  I was surprised that no
divider separated us, but we just talked like it was no big deal,
though I was having a hard time excreting anything, and after just a
ridiculously long time, I used my fingers and realized that my number
2 was lodged up in me sideways and would *never* have come out without
assistance.  After I finished, I went back to where everyone was in a
school type situation, at an assembly at the end of the semester,
after all the dorm residents had cleaned out their rooms so they could
be cleaned / sprayed / etc during the winter break.  I was in the
assembly where some social upheaval had taken place because Buzz
Lightyear was the class favorite, a fact which he had prior knowledge
of, so he didn't sit next to Betty Crocker because he didn't want to
be next to her when the announcement was made.  She was all upset and
all the cameras were watching her reaction and asking her questions
and I really had to poop <em>again</em> so I put on my shoes and ran
over to my coat and backpack, trying to optimize my time so I
distinctly wondered which I should put on first, and finally decided
on coat *then* backpack, and I ran at super high speed alternating
between high speed and low speed but long floating steps down the
hallway and gingerly busted through a door making sure I didn't
destroy a student standing slowly nearby and down the next hall and
outside and about to bust through the gate, but I noticed it was
Locked.</p>

<p class=dream>So I checked the next gate and it was locked and
realized they were all locked because the semester was over and we
weren't supposed to be in the dorms at all, and I wondered how I was
going to go number 2, but I ascended the fence anyway and went up to
the building wondering if it would be unlocked, and it was.  I
carefully walked up the steps and woke up.</p>

Bought postcards, wrote one to Josephine, bought trolley passes,
rode around on the trolleys while janette yammered with a Japanese
woman who seemed she just wanted to practice speaking English.  Ended
up at Hiroshima port to track down our Starbucks bag with camera,
postcards, Hiroshima mug from Starbucks.</p>

<p>Eating at a pastry deli at Hiroshima Port now.</p>

<p>In the hotel in Kyoto now.  Took a 200 yen subway from Kyoto
station to Shijo station.  Cool thing is that surrounding Kyoto
station are Kujo Station and Gojo Station.  "Go, Joe, here comes
Cujo!"</p>

<p>Got choto lost on the way to the hotel, but meh.</p>

<p>Ate dinner at a Chinese restaurant.  I forgot it was Chinese and
asked for okonomiyaki since janette has been looking forward to trying
some.  The waitress said "Chinese" in Japanese and I was like, "oh
yeah!" and ordered gyoza.  janette was having different trouble
ordering since she didn't know the word for noodles with chicken, and
I tried to help her ("soba, um, tori") which also wasn't working, so
the <em>cook</em> came over to rescue us.  He spoke far better English
than the waitress.</p>

<p>The gyoza wasn't like I expected (I must be used to the Japanese
version) but it was still pretty yummy.  janette got chicken and
broccoli which was even better.</p>

<p>After we finished, the cook came to ask if we wanted dessert.  I
told him he was a good salesman after we ordered ice cream and
cheesecake.  The cheescake was flavorless and the ice cream had bits
of orange peel in it.</p>

<p>janette gave me a bite of her ice cream and asked if I liked it.  I
was like, "the peel isn't very appealing to me."</p>

<p>She removed some peel and gave me a peel free bite.  I was like,
"peel free to give me another."</p>

<p>janette repealed the peel from a bite and I squealed with appeal
and delight.</p>

<p>Then we went to the hotel for the night.</p>

<p>Knotted stomach.  Will we make our flight?  On the train now from
Tsunashima to Yokohama.  Yay we caught the express train.</p>

<p>Still knotted.</p>

<p class=date>7:13am</p>

<p>Unknotting.</p>

<p>On the plane.</p>

<p>Starbucks is like fifty million miles away from the gate.  I
thought, "if we're late because of how far away Starbucks is I'll sue
Starbucks."</p>

<p>We weren't late, but just barely it seemed.</p>

<p>Not until we approached the gate did janette know we were going to
Hiroshima.</p>

border=0 align=left></a> In Hiroshima now, on a bus headed for the
Atomic bomb Museum.  Have to go because just because..  Much more
green and lush out here than in Tokyo.  This is actually quite
beautiful compared to Tokyo.  Mountains coated in trees and bushes.
Little villages like hamlets tucked in the valleys.  No towering
cities, but some highways and power tower lines scar the
landscape.</p>

<p>The flight from Tokyo to Hiroshima is 70 minutes.. Maybe 80
minutes.</p>

<p class=date>9:13am</p>

<p>We just went under a set of cameras - like 3 cameras for EACH lane
on this freeway.  I wonder what is being so carefully monitored.</p>
