<p class=dream>I had to get up to go pee, and I figured I could just
go back to the little bathroom and pee but when I got there it had no
walls, so I used a sleeping bag to cover me while I was there.  But
there was no way to hang the sleeping bag from the ceiling anymore,
and I was surprised that I hadn't thought this through a bit more
completely; when I got up to pee it seemed like everything would go
smoothly, that all conditions were accounted.</p>

<p class=dream>Once I was there, some guys were sitting near a stack
of firewood discussing grades in their college classes.  One cat was
talking on a cell phone telling his friend on the other end of the
conection how the school the friend was attending was a really
difficult school in history so he should feel fine about geting a 3.5
in history class, but the friend pointed out that he was going to
school for history and therefore he should get a better grade in that
class than all the others.</p>

<p class=dream>I just looked at the shapes of the logs of firewood and
wondered if they were all different lengths or if they were just
stacked not lined up.  I could only see one end of the logs as they
were stacked.</p>

<p class=dream>One guy asked me what I was looking at and I told him
and he was all, "no really, what are you looking at?" as if I could
not possibly be thinking about firewood lengths.</p>

<p>Kimberly said that seeing the lava on the big island (Hawaii),
which is the largest and least populated, is quite worth the price and
40 minute hike.  I wonder if I can do that hike barefoot.   She said
flip flops were all she used.  Hmmmmmm.</p>

<p>So, there <em>are</em> thistles on Hawaii.  I got some in my feet
on the way back from swimming.  I barely missed going to yoga with
Janette and Reenie; Janette left a note, so it seems I probably got
here 15 minutes after they left.  I didn't really care about yoga, but
I do want to meet this cat who teaches it; Reenie said he channels
astrological readings and tarot amazingly well.  Cool beans, it sounds
like to me.</p>

<p>But I'll just be like Mike the Man from Mars and be content with
knowing I'll meet the guy when the time is right.</p>

<p>After mailing off my postcards, save two (one actual Hawaii
postcard to Wende to make sure the free advertisment-postcard from San
Francisco gets to her first, and one to Karen cause I dated it 14
February), I decided to go swimming in the rain.  I figured no better
technique to get wet than to get wet two different ways at the same
time.  At first it was cold, but I got used to it.</p>

<p>Walked along the beach and saw in the not so far away distance some
waves crashing boldly on some rocks that stick out from shore.  I made
that point my goal.  I wasn't able to rock hop very quickly, since
everything was wet, even the rocks that don't (often) get wet from the
ocean; I could really only rock walk, stepping carefully to ensure I
didn't come back with scars.</p>

<p>Made it to the start of those rocks and discovered they were pretty
slick enough that I had to be really careful walking on them, and
sometimes was on all fours like Golem, except not as skinny.  Scared a
couple of crabs, a fish, and touched one of the brown with little
white spots water slug things, eeeeekk!! It was like an old warm
cucumber that slowly slugged away from where I touched it.  With some
delicate balancing, I made it out to the outermost point of rocks.
They sorta made a 3/5 pi arc out into the water.  I wanted to complete
the arc instead of coming back the way I had come and found myself
sorta stuck, having run out of rocks that remained visible at all
times.</p>

<p>I'd wait for the wave to go by, then step down into the water and
back up to the next visible rock.  Another wave, step down, step up.
Then I ran out of rocks that were visible at all.  A slight backtrack
gave me a few more feet, but not much help cause they were parallel to
shore.</p>

<p>I stepped onto rocks that were always covered in water; I could
barely see them because mud from the shore was being washed by the
rain into this small bay.  Then I noted I could see no more rocks at
all.  The next step was into a visual void that I knew had rocks at
the bottom, all of various heights and sharpness and organic coverage.
I realized I was scared.  <em>I'm afraid, why am I afraid, why am I a
slave to this trade, cyanide I spit to the grave, good enough to rile
you up, you want me to flip it, I can rip it any style you want.</em>
Fine.  I'm afraid.  I can either sit here and be afraid or go go go.
What's the worst that could happen?  Slice my foot open?  Fine.  I
won't die.  Let's go.</p>

<p>So I sat down on my rock, lowering my feet into the opaque water.
Felt rocks about 3 feet deep.  Fine.  Step, step, step.  "Rabbit Run"
lyrics in my head to focus on something else.</p>

<p><em>Some days I just wanna up and call it quits</em> step step
<em>I feel like I'm surrounded by a wall of .... rocks</em> stub ow
fuck step up onto a rock <em>everytime I go to get up I just</em> step
have to use my hands to keep balance <em>fall in pits my life's like
one great big</em> water pushes me over and I stub the fuck out of my
toe, trying to keep balance, splashing backward frantically to stay
upright and not have to put my hands into the unknown <em>bowl of
cherries</em>.</p>

<p>Fuck this style of writing.  Short version is that I almost ate
shit a couple of times and rocky terrain varied from waist deep to
shin deep without warning and finally near the end of the song I was
on all fours again cause I was near the shore and could see the rocks
and then triumphantly stepped up onto the usually-dry rocks on shore
as I recited <em>if I have half a chance I grab it</em> and I lost
balance and had to rotate 180 degrees and step down and then sideways
and then got stable again <em>rabbit run.</em></p>

<p>Four paw drive up the rocks to the street level.  I ran down the
half asphalt, half pothole street that would have been hellaciously
painful many times if I had stepped into the potholes containing
opaque puddles full of rocks and craggly asphalt.  Even worse would be
to step halfway into a pothole, where asphalt would have a good chance
to shred the arch of my foot.  It was only slightly painful stepping
on basically flat asphalt as I hit only some small rocks with my
tenderized feet.  Spitting "Rabbit Run" lyrics again, spitting not
cause I was reciting them quickly, but because it was still raining
quite effectively and I had water pouring down my face, I ran for a
while on the asphalt, basically avoiding the painful stuff.  Had to
slow down for a bit and then ran again when I got to some grass.</p>

<p>That's when I discovered thistles do live in Hawaii.</p>

<p>Ow fuck fuck fuck; I tried to keep running, but couldn't override
the stabbing pain each time I stepped.  Many of the stickers didn't
make it through my callouses, but those that got the tip of my toes or
that soft skin between the pads of my toes and my feet... yeowza!!  I
pulled them out, got thistles in my fingers, pulled <em>them</em> out,
stepped again, got more thistles, fuck.  I somehow made it out and got
basically everything cleared out of my footses and ran most of the
rest of the way home on the asphalt street.  This portion of street
was new and flat with some rocks on it.</p>

<p>Back to the hostel and saw the car was missing.  Sigh.  I missed
meeting this yoga cat.  But.....  it's alll good in Hawaii.</p>

<p class=date>5:13pm HST</p>

<p>Janette got the yoga guy's card and he said he'd be glad to do a
reading for us.  Sweet.</p>

<p>Today has been lazy so far. (*) I walk walk walked toward the town
and entered some shop with lots of souveniers.  The cat was all,
"where's your shoes? you forgot them.." and I go, "my shoes??" like
his was the oddest question in the world.  His shop was hardly the
paragon of high class.</p>

<p>"Yeah, shoes, normally you wear shoes in public; this isn't your
house."</p>

<p>"Even in <em>Hawaii</em>??"</p>

<p>"Especially in Hawaii."</p>

<p>"Oh." and I turned around to leave.  How is he trying to be all
"especially Hawaii," where there are no poisonous spiders, no
thistles, no cold days, plenty of lovely beaches and soft grass and
climbable rocks that beg for bare feet???</p>

<p>"Can I help you with something?"</p>

<p>Oh, now he wants to be all nice after dissing me for not wearing
shoes.  "Oh no, not at all," I say without glancing back, and I
left.</p>

<p>I was going to buy some postcards, but not from him.</p>

<p>Shit, I won't even go into a restaurant on this island that
requires shoes.  There are plenty that do not.  All four that we have
visited were fine with bare footses.</p>

<p>I got ten postcards from a different store.  Walk walk walked some
more, found out where the post office is, will use it when I want to
mail these.</p>

<p>On the back balcony, I learned the names of Matt and Mary who are
staying in the bunk above Janette and me.  Matt split to do whatever
Matts do and Mary and I chatted for a while.  One of her first
questions to me was "where do you go after this?" which I thought was
weird, but I'm all "back to Dallas."</p>

<p><em>Then</em> I realized why the question was posed that way.
They've been traveling for <em>six months</em> over north Africa,
southern Europe and south and central Asia.  Egypt, Greece, Turkey,
Italy, Switzerland, Thailand, Laos, Nepal, India, China, and others
I've forgotten.  Wow wow wow.</p>

<p>She enjoyed Thailand and Italy the most.  And they've found English
spoken in most places, enough for them to get around and speak only
English.  Coolest story she told me was how they connected with a
friend of her brother.  Or did not connect with her exactly, but were
invited to stay at her parents' house in India while they were away.
Only three servants were there to ensure a comfortable stay in this
mansion, but somehow they were able to make do.  How amazing to stay
in a mansion like that!</p>

<p>That's kinda like when Homer became a billionaire for a day.</p>

<p>Matt and Mary thought this adventure might satisfy their travel
bug, but the need to travel and see more has only grown.  Awesome.</p>

<p>Oh, and another cool thing is they *also* made cards with their
name, email address, a quote, their picture on it!  I haven't met
anyone else who has had cards made specifically for traveling.  Maybe
I'll put my picture on my next set of cards.</p>

<p>Went downstairs to chat it up with whomever might be down by the
picnic tables.  Richie (sp), Sara, Nee (sp), Kevin, Kimberly & her
sister Hillary and Pat (?) were all down there at various points.  Oh,
and Janette came to visit after her walk.  She made popcorn for us and
a <em>sandwich</em> for me!  How on earth she found sandwich making
materials out of that which we had left over from yesterday amazes
me.</p>

<p>Yammered about stuff and things and offered popcorn to everyone
multiple times (Kevin had wanted popcorn when Janette came up (down)
with the idea, but he vanished before she came down (down) with the
popcorn.) So we had extra popcorn and fun offering it over and over to
each other, especially funny when the offeree already was eating
popcorn.qqwefgft

<p>Oops; the above was typed while I stuffed my clothes into my bag,
using my keyboard as a table.</p>

<p class=date>10:02pm</p>

<p>Now I'll read today's entries to Janette and maybe <em>Stranger in
a Strange Land</em>.  I had the book in my bag and stuffed my bag down
between the wall and the bed, then had to drag it out to get the book.
Put it away again Then realized I had left my mouthguard in my bag and
had to drag it out again.  When the bag was stuffed down there the
third time Janette was all, "can I borrow your toothpaste?  or your
T-shirt?"  So funny we are!!</p>

<p>(*) HAhahahahahhaah.   Can you imagine if the day was actually lazy, and
wouldn't get up off the calendar?  It stayed 9am for hours.  Or it
refused to change from Tuesday to Wednesday.. it was still night until
noon because the day refused to get up out of bed..</p>

<p>Met Jeff, proprietor cat of Aloha Dude internet access.  He's quite
friendly so be sure to go by next time you're kickin' it Kaua'i style.
Zach says it's a good price for access, *AND* he prorated my time
after the first fifteen minutes.  Nice.</p>

<p>First good thing was him appreciating Macs over Windows-crippled PCs.</p>

<p>He pimped Poliholi, which is apparently at the other end of the
road.</p>

<p>AANNnnd he let me enter into wheresgeorge the serial numbers of the
bills I got back for change after paying him for my time.</p>

<p>Woah.</p>

<p>This reminds me a lot of Costa Rica.  Magnificently lush vegetation
as we walk through the jungle on foot wide foot trails.  This is how
the island should be paved.  None of that asphalt crap.</p>

<br>We're at a waterfall, and Zach says the water flow is way way low.
Usually this whole thing is pouring a tremendous cascade of water.  At
the gushingest part of the falls, I tried climbing up the moss covered
rock.  Way harder than the rock climbing yesterday, for I had X pounds
per square inch pounding on my whole body, making it hard to even lift
a hand much less climb up through it.  This is what it's like to live
on Saturn, eh?</p>

<p>The water was cooolld, but I got used to it pretty quickly once my
mind was on other things like how the hell to hold on under all the
pressure.  Janette said Zach got some good pictures of me.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>There's an old Toyota something next to the trail in the jungle.
Zach heard that it's only been here like five years.  That's
absolutely amazing to me.  I woulda guessed 30 or 50...  BUT I doubt
we'd have Japanese cars here that soon after Japanese bombed Pearl
Harbour.  Dammit, I referred to Pearl Harbour.</p>

<br>hi, i know i JUST commented on another journal entry, but i hadnt read about your &ldquo;dont drown&rdquo; games yet. a really funny game to play in the ocean that is actually a lot harder than it sounds, is this thing i used to do with meg in galveston all the time. you can only stand on our knees, and we pretended we were midgets, who&rsquo;s homeland was a tiny midget island far away where the whole population was midgets&hellip;.kinda like munchkin-land from wizard of oz. some wizard (although you may pick your own foe) had thrown us into the ocean and we had to fight the waves (his minions) to get back. so we were scuffling around the ocean on our knees punching at waves and shouting curses as this evil wizard while trying not to drown. excellent fun. =0)</p>

<p>We went to a cool beach and I invented two games.  The first one is
called Find A Beach With Waves That Have A Rather Large Variance In
How High They Wash Ashore And Lie Down While Plugging Your Nose And
Ears So That Sometimes Your Entire Body Will Be Covered In Water And
Hold Your Breath When The Water Comes!  Or I might rename it to Don't
Drink The Water.  Or maybe Don't Drown.  The game is really fun; I was
totally giddy and just laughing at the hilarious waves with delicious
anticipation!  I got pretty good at predicting whether a wave was
going to just touch my feet or reach my back or if it would gush over
me.  Sometimes the waves would float me around and one even turned me
around so my head was pointing at the water.  So hilarious!
Definitely a game I'll play again sometime.</p>

<p>The other game is a variant of the game known as Golf, but I played
without seeking to knock the ball into a specific hole.  I'd just
throw it down within a beach covered in large rocks and the ball would
bounce any crazy direction it pleased.  Then I go find the ball and
bounce it again.</p>

<p>A couple of times I slipped pretty badly on the rocks; they were
sooooo slick.  One rock looked like it was completely dry and not
slick.  My right foot shot forward and I collapsed down onto my left
shin.  Didn't break the skin, but I've got a bit of a bruise now.
Very slight, but it could have been baad news.  I also fell and came
close to bending my fingers backwards farther than is my preference.
Whew.  No injuries that will keep me from doing whatever I'd like to
do for the rest of the time we're here.</p>

<p>I found a lot of beach glass for Janette; she collects it.  Some
sorta large pieces and some pretty colors.  I tried to get a piece of
the top of a bottle that included the mouth of the bottle intact, but
it was lodged between some rocks so I couldn't get it out.</p>

<p>As we left, Janette or Zach found a coconut and Zach opened it by
beating it on a rock.  An unshaved guy got out of his car, "what are
you doing to that poor rock?"  The rest of his banter was as funny and
often stranger than that.</p>

<p>I like the looks of people that seem to be locals here.  I wonder
if I'll come back to live for a while.</p>

<p>I just read my journal entries to Janette, during which time I
found that I scratched my glasses.  That musta happened when they
quite dirty after I played Don't Drown and then wiped them clean with
my T-shirt.</p>

<p>D'oh.</p>

<p>I'm going to read <em>Stranger in a Strange Land</em> using my
laptop screen as a multi-thousand dollar night light until we fall
asleep.</p>
