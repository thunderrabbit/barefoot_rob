<p><p>At KTRU, I helped with three super great customer
(listener) services.</p>

<ol>
<p><li>A listener called in asking for a band called
Lifter.  She said she wanted to hear a song that we
had on a 7" vinyl by them.  With about 2 minutes left
on my current selection, I searched through our three
different locations for 7" vinyl.  I found her
selection in the third location with 19 seconds left
on the currently playing CD.  In that 19 seconds, I
cued up her selection and the segue was great!

<p><li>A listener called asking for "a parody song of
Nine Inch Nails 'closer', except it's about farm
animals."  I knew immediately to what he was
referring.  I was all, "Um, I am going to choose not
to play that song.  However, if you give me your
mailing address, I will mail you my copy of that CD! 
The caller was all, "cool" and gave me his address. 
I'll mail the CD on Monday.

<p><li>A listener called asking for "a cover of Phil
Collins 'in the air tonight' by Godflesh."  I looked
for it, and found a CD by Godflesh but not the song he
was looking for.  As I was speaking on the air, I
mentioned that "I found Godflesh, but not the song you
wanted, so call me back, and we'll get something else
on for you."  Michael happened to be in the station
and he goes, "oh, it's by Godhead Silo."  He
immediately grabbed the correct CD, and put it in the
player as I explained, "oh - I'm being told the song
you want is by Godhead Silo, not by Godflesh.  So here
is the song you requested.  Yup, KTRU is customer
service number one."

<p>In that short amount of time, Michael had grabbed
the correct CD and cued up the song.  As soon as I was
done talking we played it.

<p>Yay KTRU!!
</ol>

                        <p><p class=date>12:04 pm Friday 8 September 2000</p>

<p><p>Maggie, Wende, and I are at Cafe Adobe munching lunch before we go see
<em>Whipped</em>, starring the lovely Amanda Peet.</p>

<p><p>A cool thing is a water fountain outside.  It&rsquo;s got normal upward
sprayers in the middle and then very pure pristine angled in squirters
around the perimeter.  The angled in ones are pretty cool, but I must say
the ones in Chicago were way more precise and perfect.</p>

<p><p>These are certainly nice, and these are now doing a weird dance wobbly
water thing (not by changing the angle but by changing the pressure).</p>

<p><p>Maggie is describing how she was stuck in Chicago for an extra day for a
work related project thing.  She has the sense that she was held over for a
day so that she could tell a man that he was a good person.  See, she saw
this guy on the last dayshe was supposed to be there and had a feeling that
she was supposed to tell him, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a good person.&rdquo;  She couldn&rsquo;t get the
nerve to do it, and was held up a day.  The next day she saw the man again
and felt the feeling even more strongly.  She never did speak to him.</p>

<p><p>Now as she describes the story, she&rsquo;s saying she wishes she had told him.</p>

<p><p>Now Maggie says, &ldquo;Rob loves his keyboard.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>This is true.</p>

<p><p>Heather is our waitress.  She looks like the girl from <em>Chasing
Amy</em> who looks like Rene Zelwegger (sp).</p>

<p>1:01 pm</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m in the screening room now of the theater.  The girls are peeing (in
separate restrooms).  There&rsquo;s only about a few hundred seats in this room;
it looks like <em>Whipped</em> is not going to be shown very long.   They&rsquo;re
not expecting big crowds.</p>

<p><p>Sigh.  poor oh-so-cute Amanda Peet.</p>

<p><p>Oh my gosh guess what!!   Dude&rsquo;s friend Maz <em><em>knows</em></em> the guys who
wrote and directed <em>Whipped</em> and one of them is boyfriend of Amanda
Peet!  That&rsquo;s how they got her in the film, and that means that I&rsquo;m  I&rsquo;m
only 4 steps away from Amanda Peet!!!  Wow!  And really I have met Maz and
he&rsquo;s cool and would pretty much remember me, so I&rsquo;m only three steps away
from Amanda Peet.  Wow!</p>

<p><p>The first trailer was for <em>Unbreakable</em>. I was all, &ldquo;Wende watch
this!!&rdquo;  I didn&rsquo;t blink through the entire trailer; I love it!</p>

<p><p>Trailer for <em>Buying The Cow</em> looks pretty funny to Wende, and
probably to me.</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>So we saw <em>Whipped</em>.  Very funny film once I got past how
chauvanistic these characters are.  Their languge is gutter terrible, but I
don&rsquo;t mind it at all.   I don&rsquo;t have as big of a crush on Amanda Peet
anymore; her character was a lot more cute in <em>The Whole Nine Yards</em>.</p>

<p><p>Here are two funny lines that I wrote during the film:</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;First of all it&rsquo;s jujitsu, faggot.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay; being gay is kinda hip now.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>After the movie, we ate at Maggie Moo&rsquo;s, a small ice cream shop like
Marble Slab or Amy&rsquo;s.  Maggie Moo&rsquo;s has a Thelma or Louise looking cow
character as their mascot.</p>

<p><p>See ya.</p>

                        <p><p class=date>6:14 pm Thursday 7 September 2000</p>

<p><p>Our Investment Club is meeting now in the UC Underground at University of
Houston.  Interesting to be back in my old haunt at the beginning of the
semester.  People hanging out in here, reading, talking, chilling.</p>

<p><p class=date>7:52 pm</p>

<p><p>Meeting was short and fine.  Especially short for me.  Ya know why?..</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m in court now, amidst the quiet, soon to be standing before the
honorable so-and-so.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;As your name is called please answer &lsquo;here&rsquo; loudly.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Easily only one third of the people called &ldquo;here.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Those who were called and answered are moved to the other side of the
room.  According to my Visor, it&rsquo;s only 7:55 pm, 5 minutes before we are
supposed to be here.  I wonder if that intentionally sorts the early people
to help them get out more quickly.  Interesting theory.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m the sixth person called.</p>

<p><p class=date>7:58 pm</p>

<p><p>First row including me is standing. bye</p>

<p><p class=date>8:02 pm</p>

<p><p>That was fast. Now I&rsquo;m sittin&rsquo; back down.</p>

<p><p>As I stood in front of the judge she presented my case and my options,
&ldquo;Failure to yield right of way; guilty or not guilty?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Not guilty.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>She stamped [TRIAL] on my ticket.  Then she asked &ldquo;do you want a judge or
a jury?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Um, is a judge faster?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>She nodded</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Then judge.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;you don&rsquo;t want to take Defensive Driving?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;If I do that will my ticket be entirely removed?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;If you do everything like you&rsquo;re supposed to.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I will do everything that I&rsquo;m supposed to.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Do you have 61 dollars now?.. Cash or credit card&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Check?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Check is fine.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll pay with a check.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>She sighed a smile as she scribbled out [TRIAL] on my docket.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Okay, please sit back down on the front row.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p><em>Bang</em> that was it.</p>

<p><p>Dangit I just realized that I didn&rsquo;t even get a chance to do what I
wanted to do.. : tell them that I had insurance even thought I gave the cop
dude my wrong insurance card.</p>

<p><p class=date>8:06 pm</p>

<p><p>The guy up there now is giving her all the possible details, pleading his
case&hellip;  She&rsquo;s listening patiently.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let me tell you about that.&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;&hellip; that&rsquo;s not fair.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to take defensive driving?&rdquo; she asks.</p>

<p><p>No I don&rsquo;t want to do that either&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Will you pay this fee?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay this fee,&rdquo; he conceded..  something something and  now he&rsquo;s
sitting down.</p>

<p><p>Except that he just got moved to the front row of the other side of the
room.</p>

<p><p class=date>8:12 pm</p>

<p><p>A guy with squeaky shoes just walked in.  Bailiff called him up.  &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>___  (I couldn&rsquo;t hear his answer)</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I got you; man you&rsquo;re late.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Now bailiff asks, &ldquo;is there anyone else who came in late for the 8pm
docket and did not hear their name called?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>No one.</p>

<p><p class=date>8:14 pm</p>

<p><p>Now they just called the last row back up.  Is it the last row to do part
1, or do they get to do part 2 first?  Looks like they&rsquo;re on part 1 still.</p>

<p><p>Squeaky Shoes is in line now.  Part 1.</p>

<p><p class=date>8:20 pm</p>

<p><p>Squeaky Shoes is almost up.  I think he&rsquo;s the last person.  His name is
Darell (sp).   She&rsquo;s saying &ldquo;all you had to pay was $85 since May.&rdquo;  She
counts on her fingers. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s 4 months.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>The people in benches with me are laughing.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you 2 weeks for you to pay the balance.&rdquo;  She&rsquo;s smiling.  She
has braces.</p>

<p><p>Darell Squeaky Shoes just sat back down.</p>

<p><p>Part 2&hellip;&hellip;. coming soon to a court near me.  Judge is stacking some
papers.</p>

<p><p class=date>8:23 pm</p>

<p><p>Judge just split.  Now I bet we&rsquo;re just paying her court lackies and
splitting.   This sucked.   I talked to the judge for 30 seconds.  $61.
Erg.</p>

<p><p>Just like a dr visit.</p>

<p><p class=date>8:28 pm</p>

<p><p>They called me up.  &ldquo;Please raise your right hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p><em>this is stupid</em>, I&rsquo;m thinking.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Do you solemly swear that you have a valid TX drivers license and have
not taken a defensive driving class within the last 4 months to remove a
moving violation from your record?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>She wrote my name and case number in perfect 2nd grade teacher
handwriting.</p>

<p><p>She wrote a date 3-6-2000 and circled it on the bottom.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Is that how long I have?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Do you think I can find a class in time?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>The bailiff remarked, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d be surprised at how many people don&rsquo;t do
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>She explained which document to send to Austin to request my driving
record and which to give to the cashier downstairs.  Wow.  Bye.</p>

<p><p>Work has been pretty great today.  I&rsquo;ve essentially comleted the ucky
project that I&rsquo;ve been working on for a few days and am moving back to a
version of the big huge giant project that I was working on earlier in the
year.</p>

<p><p>Right now I&rsquo;m adding some code to a current project that will disallow
users to submit a form until the entire form is loaded.  It turns out that
we have lost some data that way - the page wasn&rsquo;t fully loaded so when the
user pressed [Go] on the page, not all of the data was sent.  This is a rare
occurrence..  it would only happen if the user presses [Go] before the page
is loaded, which usually only takes a few seconds.</p>

<p><p>Tomorrow I&rsquo;m meeting a woman named Fiona for lunch to exchange music.  I
burned a copy of Poise Noir &ldquo;Pity For The Self&rdquo; for her and she&rsquo;s compiling
a jungle mix thing for me.  Super great!</p>

<p><p>I wonder what she&rsquo;ll be like;  we haven&rsquo;t met, but have only emailed each
other.  We might have spoken on the phone but and I might be making that
rumor up in my head.</p>

<p class=date>10:47pm CDT Tuesday 5 September 2000</p>

<p><p>We played ultimate tonight even though it&rsquo;s Tuesday and we usually
play on Wednesday.  We wanted to get an extra practice in before the
<a href="https://www.strayconesports.com">HURL Fall League</a> begins.</p>

<p><p>Ironically, just before I went out to play tonight, I visited the
above linked website and determined that the games are on Sunday and
not Saturday as they were last tournament.  I&rsquo;ll be at Northwoods with
the youth each Sunday.  No tournament for me.  But I payed my $20, so
I&rsquo;ll get a t-shirt and disc out of the deal.</p>

<p><p>We began play tonight with only 8 players.  We spent a significant
time just tossing three discs around - long throws for a while then
short ones as we were all arranged in a small circle.  The circle
slowly grew as we like to throw long throws.  Then we played for about
45 minutes.  Sarah showed up as a sub for the other team so we played
savage and they got to rest on occassion.</p>

<p><p>I had one super great catch, although I landed out of bounds.  A
couple of nice throws and one almost great catch that I missed.</p>

<p><p>- -</p>

<p><p>On the way home, I drove under a traffic light with all three
lights (red yellow and green) lit in all four directions.  I didn&rsquo;t
have my camera, so I got home, ran inside for the camera, went back
for the picture and then back home.  I only had one frame left on the
roll of film.  The flash went off; I have no idea how it will turn
out.</p>

<p><p>Wende and I ate at Mission Burritos today.  Lovely lunch of salad for me
and taco soup for her.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ve turned in the van and have done a preliminary financial balance on
the results.. I had to pay $200 from my own pocket.  This money will have to
be reimbursed from the church youth groups I imagine.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m at work now, transferring my adventures from my Visor to my website.</p>

<p><p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was in school again - college and had procrastinated on my
math homework.  I had an awareness of what I needed to do, but I hadn&rsquo;t done
it.  I needed to simply get organizeed organize my thoughts and do the work.
I was driving away from the school(UH) and then I realizrd I had forgotten
something so I drove backwrds in the othe lane other land and drove back
toward the campus, and stopped at a house near the end of the street.  It
was like a frat house or a home away from home.</p>

<p><p>Not that I ever have been inside a frat house&hellip;</p>

                        <p><p class=date>7:06am Sunday 3 September 2000</p>

<p><p>Wake up is rough.  but okay.</p>

<p><p class=date>8:53 am</p>

<p><p>This is Nancy&rsquo;s last rally.  Many of the youth of our two vans would like
to stay for a bit longer and eat at Denny&rsquo;s with Nancy et al.  I believe
that none of the youth necessarily want to go home immediately.</p>

<p><p>However, Evelyn is astonishingly passionate about not going to Denny&rsquo;s.
&ldquo;We advisors make such a committment and give so much of ourselves and&rdquo; and
all this bullshit lumping advisors into one pile.  I&rsquo;m so sad and angry that
she&rsquo;s being such a fucking goddamn bitch about it.  I hope she never drives
with any youth to a rally again.</p>

<p><p class=date>9:15 am</p>

<p><p>I was sitting talking (cooling off) with Susie about it, and Debbie
yelled for us to joing the closing circle.  We&rsquo;re out at closing circle now.</p>

<p><p class=date>9:48 am</p>

<p><p>Hugs and now tumbled into the van.</p>

<p><p class=date>9:56 am</p>

<p><p>Driving now. Tanner is pacing beside us.   But I think he cannot see in
because of tinted windows on the van.</p>

<p><p class=date>10:55 am</p>

<p><p>Ryan is starting a game of Silent Football.</p>

<p><p class=date>11:54 am</p>

<p><p>They&rsquo;re still playing; Rick is still driving, I have been sleeping,  and
Christina has been trying to sleep, but grumbles some variation of &ldquo;shut up&rdquo;
when they are loud.</p>

<p><p>Since a new semester is beginning at KTRU, the KTRU schedule will have
some empty shifts in the wee hous of the night.  I am considering asking for
permission to simply recite the rules to Silent Football as I normally say
them so I can record them for Sean.</p>

<p><p class=date>12:17 pm</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;ve been taking a different route back to Houston; we&rsquo;ll ultimately end
up on highway 59.  Many many small towns with 45 mph sections and stop
lights.  Way slower than on the way up here I am certain.</p>

<p><p>Someone is named Talkie Talkie Robbie Robbie in the Silent Football game.
Very silly.</p>

<p><p class=date>12:38 pm</p>

<p><p>We are in Caddo Oklahoma, stopped at Dairy Queen.  The Silent Football
game is still going strong.</p>

<p><p class=date>1:50 pm</p>

<p><p>Now we&rsquo;re on the road again and we&rsquo;ve done some seat switching so I&rsquo;m in
the back back back seat with Amanda and Christina.</p>

<p><p>Amanda says:</p>

<p><p class=grafitti>Has anyone ever seen a squirrel take a shit?   (&hellip;)</p>

<p><p class=date>2:49 pm</p>

<p><p>Nicole just braided her hair.  Patrick hasn&rsquo;t eaten any bugs on this
trip.  Christina and Amanda relayed the story about the roadies at the show
last night.</p>

<p><p class=date>3:43 pm</p>

<p><p>I just woke up.  The whole van was sleepin&rsquo; except for Rick and Lacy.</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;re at mile marker 260 and just happened to stop for gas.  I&rsquo;ll
probably drive now.</p>

<p><p class=date>4:10 pm</p>

<p><p>On the road again&hellip;</p>

<p><p>Ryan is telling cow knock knock  jokes over the walkie talkies.</p>

<p><p>Phat Pat took Amy&rsquo;s seat in the other van, Christina just heard from Amy.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m still greatly considering driving up to Northwoods each week to be
advisorly with them.</p>

<p><p class=date>5:25 pm</p>

<p><p>Sitting in the back of the van I hear much more interesting stories.</p>

<p><p class=date>5:28 pm</p>

<p><p>Colleen and I are throwing stuff back and forth.  She&rsquo;s in the front
bench seat.</p>

<p><p class=message>hey it&rsquo;s Christina Lusk! Sitting in the back of the van
dyin&rsquo; of heat here!  We are about an hour thirty away. I am going nuts in
the close quarters.  It&rsquo;s all good though.  I keep thinking of Amanda and
Grantly and chillin&rsquo;.  I cried at the end of the rally cause I realized that
I only have 4 left + SWUUSI!  So I&rsquo;m starting to get sad about rallies
ending for me cause they are really starting to get good.  Well, I should
stop rambling and go chill. Love lots,  christina!</p>

<p><p class=date>6:33pm</p>

<p><p>We just looked through a bunch of pics taken by Ryan, .. many from SWUUSI
and from his trip to Europe this summer.  (Amersterdam and Germany and Paris</p>

<p><p>Rick has driven the entire way home.  Wow wow wow wow wow wow wow.  The
most interesting thing about that is Rick drove Fred, Mike and I to and from
Dallas Rally 1990.  I think.  So thankful then and so thankful now.</p>

<p><p>At our last stop, a trailer of cattle was parked near our van.  Nicole
got out to say HI to them, but couldn&rsquo;t decide if they were nice cows that
she could pet.</p>

<p><p class=date>6:37pm</p>

<p><p>Nicole is unbraiding her hair (that she braided a couple of hours ago)
and Ryan is layering it with Amy&rsquo;s.</p>

<p><p class=date>6:39 pm</p>

<p><p>We just passed mile marker 100 on I-45 south</p>

<p><p class=date>6:47 pm</p>

<p><p>Christina is being easily entertained by the zipper on her backpack.</p>

<p><p class=date>6:51 pm</p>

<p><p>We are stopped again to let two youth go pee.  We are so close to being
back!</p>

<p><p class=date>8:06 pm</p>

<p><p>We are parked in the parking lot by the church  Pretty much everyone has
paid up except for a couple of youth and I have high hopes for getting that
money.  Last time I drove, I ended up paying for part of the van.</p>

<p><p class=date>8:47 pm</p>

<p><p>Home.  Shower.  I haven&rsquo;t yet changed clothes this weekend, much less
showered, including the whipped cream pies in my face and hair, including
the dunking tank.  (but I did rinse off the whipped cream before being
dunked)</p>

<p><p>Worship was an angel wash and then flower communion.</p>

<p><p>For the angel wash, I saw many people ducking down below the hands before
them.  I simply closed my eyes and walked through without ducking.  My
thinking was that I trust this group enough to not hit me.</p>

<p><p>Later, I found that Sean was very impressed with this. He said that
everyone just raised up to let Rob through.  I feel so honored by this group
that I honor so much.</p>

<p><p>For the flower communion, we each chose a flower (carnation) out of a big
bucket.  Then placed them into a fountain and stated what we give to the
community.   Many people said stuff like &ldquo;love&rdquo; &ldquo;respect&rdquo; &ldquo; dignity&rdquo;
&ldquo;hope&rdquo;..  Steve said, &ldquo;Rocky raccoon&rdquo;.  I said &ldquo;Silent Football.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>now talent show is about to start.</p>

<p><p class=date>1:26 am</p>

<p><p>This is Nancy Pants last rally.  She told her duck joke for the last
time.  Shira has taken the honor of telling the joke at future rallies.</p>

<p><p>Now Ashley is reading <em>The Adventures of Hardcore Bunny and the
Hardcore Pants</em> (or something), written by Annie and Illustrated by
Nick.</p>

<p><p>A line from the book: &ldquo;And anyway, bunnies don&rsquo;t wear pants.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Here is the bridge of the song written for Nancy:</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;nanoonancy look at nancy&rsquo;s pants
<br>her body doesnt move when you watch her dance
<br>tells her silly duck joke at every chance
<br>what color are nancy&rsquo;s pants&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>(Thanks to Sean for typing them for me)</p>

<p><p class=date>2:27am</p>

<p><p>I pretty much fell asleep for the rest of the talent show.</p>

<p><p>Now we are collected for Silent Football.  Nick is dictator.</p>

<p><p>Here are some funny quotes from the game:</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I will now describe the rules, which are needlessly complex and obtuse.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&rdquo;&hellip;the game starts with passing a sacred invisible tastelesss odorless
football.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&rdquo;&hellip;In reverse order of mostness&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Here&rsquo;s the list of who played: Ian, Sean, Aaron, Laura, Ryan, Diane,
Carrie, Kelyn, Lauren, Amelia, Elizabeth, Rob.  We all went by Mr or Miss
(first name) except for Ryan who was Mr Bunny.  He was wearing huge balloon
rabbit ears and carrot.</p>

<p><p class=date>2:49am</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;If two entities lie between Mr Aaron and Mr Dictator, then Mr Aaron
might have known that Mr Aaron could not have had the football&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mr Dictator, endquote.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>2:51am</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I thank Ms Laura for being the first person to point out anything
pointful.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>2:54am</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Actually Miss Elizabeth&rsquo;s actions are quite staraight forward, for Miss
Elizabeth is eating cookies.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mr Aaron, permit me to translate.  When Mr Bunny says &lsquo;and I quote,&rsquo; Mr
bunny means &lsquo;and I quote.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>3:05am</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;If a player does not commit a cold rush of air, then there is no limit
to a player&rsquo;s fwappery.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>3:07am</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;While Mr Bunny is not a physics major, parallel univii do not exist.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hypothetical idiot savantry&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>3:15am</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mr Bunny is hereby given two univii.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>3:22am</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Miss Dianah is going straight to hell!  with a walrus&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>3:31am</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;If I choose to create a fiery pit of hell type annex, then I am
perfectly free to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>3:53am</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mr Universe, I have 4 and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> penance points&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Due to the fact that Miss Dianahs error was funny as shit, Miss Dianah
will get away with that one.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>3:56am</p>

<p><p>Mr Bunny has committed the heinous crime of shrodeming a shrug and thus
loses the game.</p>

<p><p class=date>4:09 am</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;re about to play a second game of Silent Football with me as dictator.
Sean is describing the Silent Football game from New Orleans.</p>

<p><p class=date>4:25am</p>

<p><p>New game begins</p>

<p><p>??? as &ldquo;High Priestess&rdquo;
<br>Sean as &ldquo;Mister The Bibbster&rdquo;
<br>Joan as &ldquo;Miss HeeHeeHee&rdquo;
<br>Phat Pat as &ldquo;Reverand Phat Pat Pattysmack Give a Dog a bone&rdquo;
<br>Lauren as &ldquo;Silent Roberta&rdquo;
<br>Elizabeth as &ldquo;Oreo Both&rdquo;
<br>Rob as any name variation of Mister Dictator, but not &ldquo;Mister Dictator&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>4:45am</p>

<p><p>Reverand Phat Pat Patty Smack Giv a Dog a Bone is trying to recite Little
Bunny Foo Foo</p>

<p><p class=date>4:52am</p>

<p><p>Christina et al tried to fuck up the game and Pat threw a can and hit
someone in the head.  Then they ran off screamng.</p>

<p><p class=date>5:01am</p>

<p><p>Christina and others just came in again and I tried to tell them gently
but I think I made her mad.</p>

<p><p class=date>5:24am</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Maestro Stiffy Chips&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>5:28am</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mr Phat Pat Pattysmack Give a Dog a Bone will receive penance points for
not remembering Senor Silent Roberta&rsquo;s error and Mr Chair will recieve <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
of one penance points for making noise.</p>

<p><p class=date>5:32am</p>

<p><p>The game ends in a fit of giggles</p>

                        <p><p class=date>4:18am Saturday 2 September 2000</p>

<p><p>We have arrived.  Many hugs after the vans were greeted by happy youth.
We just parked them next to the curb and abandoned them.  I grabbed the keys
and all my stuff.  Now I&rsquo;ve found a quiet-ish area to sleep.  Nice carpet.
A tad chilly but my sleepin&rsquo; bag will take care of that nicely.</p>

<p><p>One other advisor sleeping here; it looks like Lee Ann, but I&rsquo;m not sure
of her name.  I&rsquo;m pretty sure I know her face (but she&rsquo;s sleeping face
down.)</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m going to set up my bed and go downstairs to say HI and stuff.</p>

<p><p>I see many youth whose names I don&rsquo;t know  (saw many)   I&rsquo;ll just have to
go learn them.</p>

<p><p>Yay!</p>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s 4:21 am now. I&rsquo;m tired.</p>

<p><p class=date>5:05 am</p>

<p><p>Music blaring, Elizabeth and I are sitting on the couch quizzing and
learning names.  Amber, Beverly, Brian, Nick, Amanda, Bethany, Susie,
Heathre (not misspelled).</p>

<p><p>Noah, Ryan M, A.J. hanging and swinging from the ceiling iron.  Very
primatial.  Psycho even joined them for a bit.</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>Psycho being introduced to Bethany.  Bethany was all, &ldquo;no, really what&rsquo;s
his name?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Psycho.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>so Psycho was all, &ldquo;no, reallly what&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Bethany. &ldquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, really what is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Very funny.</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p class=grafitti>&ldquo;The time has come,&rdquo; the walrus said, &ldquo;to talk of many
things - of shoes, and ships, and sealing wax - of cabbages and kings, and
why the sea is boiling hot, and whether pigs have wings.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>5:13 am</p>

<p><p>Kellen, Andy, Cassie,</p>

<p><p class=date>5:54 am</p>

<p><p>Nearing name overload, but doing well.  I&rsquo;m upstairs, vaguely on a quest
to find where the T-shirts are.  except this year they are wife beaters.
(tank tops) with a logo on the front and the back.</p>

<p><p>Elizabeth determined that my name-learning crutch was Bryn.  Now that
she&rsquo;s gone to Australia, I am bad at remembering names.  But I think that
the main reason is that I&rsquo;m tired.</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>Elizabeth to me, &ldquo;we need to play Silent Football&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to play.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I laughed.. She believed me!!</p>

<p><p>Bethany says she&rsquo;ll play if we explain the rules.  &ldquo;We always explain
them at the beginning of the game.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>5:58am</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m going to sleep now.</p>

<p><p class=date>6:43 am</p>

<p><p>We just talked to Bryn!!  She said she was all sad that she was missing
the rally then thought, hey, forget that, I&rsquo;ll just call!!  She&rsquo;s talking to
several of the youth here.  She&rsquo;s 15 hours ahead of us so it&rsquo;s 9:43pm
Saturday night there now.  Wow.</p>

<p><p>She said we should come visit now because the airline prices within the
country are ridiculously low for the Olympics.  &ldquo;No, come fly with us!&rdquo;  $66
to fly from Sydney to Brisbane to Mebourne.</p>

<p><p>She said that even though it&rsquo;s winter there, it&rsquo;s all hot and dry and
fires are breaking out everywhere.</p>

<p><p>I told her youth council was great.</p>

<p><p class=date>6:47am</p>

<p><p>Oh!!   I just ran down to tell her she could read about YC online, but
she had only 2 minutes left when I quit talking; they&rsquo;ve hung up now.</p>

<p><p>So I told her briefly about Youth Council and that Laura Douglas got us
$400 to visit another district so we&rsquo;re going to come down to see her.
Elizabeth was all, &ldquo;I get to go!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I said, &ldquo;true&rdquo; about something and she said that they just didn&rsquo;t get it
down there.  I was all, &ldquo;tell them that all Americans say true and false
instead of yes and no.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>The phone connection was wonderfully clear.</p>

<p><p class=date>6:50am</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m going back to bed.</p>
