<p>Today S at CB requested they be able to preview articles before
they&rsquo;re published.  I was like, &ldquo;um, it&rsquo;s already finished,&rdquo; because
Alfonzo wrote that functionality ages ago.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow! I didn&rsquo;t know that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So now they want to preview other things, so I&rsquo;ll be copying his code
to those other not-yet-previewable things.</p>

<p>Lin and I have been looking at vacuum cleaners recently, wavering
between Electrolux and Dyson, and now wondering if we really need a
new one at all.  She was thinking 20,000 yen at first, and now we&rsquo;re
in the 60,000 yen range.  Hmm.</p>

<p>If it lasts 5 years, that&rsquo;s 1000 yen per month.</p>

<p>which is far more complicated.  :-)</p>

<p>Relic Expedition features a lot more strategy; there are far more
options available per player per turn, including cases where each
player gets to move NPCs during another player&rsquo;s turn.</p>

<p>a fun analog game with dice and random cards to add chance, and the
option of re-rolling dice to give some strategy.  We were playing with
5 players, so it was mostly a game of staying alive moreso than using
the cards to do tricksy stuff.</p>

<p>I lost, Johan won!</p>

<p>Why do I get so grouchy when I have to repeat myself.  I see the words
&ldquo;have to&rdquo; there, but I mean when I say something and Lin didn&rsquo;t hear
me/ didn&rsquo;t understand me/ wasn&rsquo;t listening, and she goes, &ldquo;what?&rdquo; (or
says nothing at all.)</p>

<p>Hideo at CPC repeats himself all the time because he&rsquo;s often in charge
of 10 or 15 people, all of whom are kinda doing their own thing, or
possibly on different schedules.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m always so impressed when I see people repeat themselves for people
who weren&rsquo;t listening.  I fucking hate it.  What&rsquo;s triggering that
hate/anger?</p>

<p>Back in Houston, I was looking at this issue, and had a spontaneous
memory which I&rsquo;m calling a memory from a past life because, well, I
remember telling my army buddy he was loading a weapon incorrectly,
and after he didn&rsquo;t listen, he was killed by it when he fired it.</p>

<p>I was never in the army so it&rsquo;s an interesting memory for me.</p>

<p>But there&rsquo;s still more triggering this thing because crying about my
army buddy&rsquo;s death doesn&rsquo;t seem to have resolved everything.</p>

<p>Speaking English in Japan gives me ample opportunity to look at this
issue.</p>

<div class="dream">
On a bus with lots of people including two people who were co-workers.
One was a reporter who had been standing all day.  She said to the
other as she got off the bus that her feet hurt and she really wanted
a foot massages.  After she got off the bus, I asked him if I could
have her phone number to give her a massage.

He was like, "no" and left it at that because it was the expected
answer.

Then I go, "well, can I teach you how to give foot massage?"

He goes, "no; I don't have time for that."

After a while, he said, "let me give you some feedback."

I said "okay, I'm turning off my pone" as I turned off my phone; I
legitimately wante to hear it.

He said, "you're bugging me at work about massage when I have to work."

And I go okay, "I undersand you're busy, and I be you don't want to
learn how to give foot massage."

He goes, "no; I said I don't have time for it.."  He goes, "okay join
me for a reiki, shaanism, massage, I-group, programming, painting,
electron, barbershop, chromosome, motorized robotics, public speaking
class."

I go "okay,  When is it?"

He goes, "you have to teach it."

"Well, you said join before.  Anyway I don't know all those things so I
cannot teach them all; your scenario isn't analagous to mine, but I get
your essential point; You aren't interested in learning foot massage
to give to her."

<p>I woke my computer from sleep, and it didn&rsquo;t respond to any
keypresses, either from its own keyboard or the USB keyboard.  The
mouse cursor wouldn&rsquo;t move, using either the trackpad or USB mouse.
The only key which worked was the power key.  I pressed it for a while
and the dialog boxed popped up: Are you sure you want to shut down the
computer?  Yes, but I couldn&rsquo;t select any of the buttons. So I just
held the power key and powered it off.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s lesson was great because I remembered what I said we would do:
short presentations on any topic the students liked.  About half
actually brought something, and we did four presentations out of five
people who came:</p>

<ol>
<li>a ほや or sea squirt phone attachment</li>
<li>a black pen</li>
<li>a travel magazine</li>
<li>a pack of cigarettes</li>
</ol>

<p>The fifth looked like a little rubber man whose body was draped over a
cliff and he was hanging on for his life.  Uh oh!</p>
