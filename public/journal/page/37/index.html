<p>We got to the beach around 10am and it was warm; by the time we left
around 2pm it was hotter than I could stand to walk barefoot on the
sand.</p>

<p>We ate at a vegetarian buffet <a href="https://yoganiigata.jp/">https://yoganiigata.jp/</a> Good for
1600 yen per person.</p>

<p class="dream">
There's an approach to Dallas airport over a mountain, where we fly through a mountain pass, over a ridge, right around an outcropping of rock, and then into a cave which serves as the runway.
</p>

<p class="dream">
This was my forth time to arrive on this runway, and the big screen window in front gives everyone a great view of the approach in real-time.  As usual, everyone shares the same awestruck feelings, ranging from "we are all going to die" to "wow that's amazing", but that's only from what we can see through the window.
</p>

<p class="dream">
This time, I noticed something orders of magnitude more amazing than any other time I have arrived at this airport.  As the plane flew into the cave, we didn't touch down immediately like most times.  This time the pilot slowed us down so once we actually landed, we rolled only 21 meters after wheels contacted the ground.
</p>

<p class="dream">
I pointed out to some of the other passengers who were all duly impressed with the visible parts of the landing, because I was sitting where I could see the tachometer, and how it didn't start counting until we were nearly stopped.
</p>

<p class="dream">
I stepped down off the platform and walked to where the pilots were gathering their bags and talking together.
</p>

<p class="dream">
I shouted "Captain Solo!" to get their attention with a comparison to Han Solo (and his flight skills) because I heard many passengers make the same comparison while witnessing the landing.
</p>

<p class="dream">
They looked up, and I was like "Captain, I have arrived at this airport several times, and it's always amazing, but this time I noticed how we only rolled twenty one meters after touchdown.  I'm so impressed I just had to say thank you."
</p>

<p class="dream">
The older Captain nodded with humble thanks and the younger said "be sure to prepare a present," so I immediately handed over my phone which was open on the back screen to a video clip of us standing dangerously close to the edge of the very same outcropping of rock around which we have to fly during this approach.
</p>

<p class="dream">
They smiled and said like wow nice picture how did you get that? And though it was actually a selfie, I realized it might be in an illegal location, so I was like "oh I just found it online.." and he handed the phone back, saying thanks for showing me; I hadn't seen it before.
</p>

<p>And I woke up.</p>

<p>Driving to Niigata is taking ages because of the speed limit and
stuff, but we are having fun with Mikako in the car with us as Lin
drives.  I have never gotten a driver&rsquo;s license in Japan, but it is
long trips like this that kinda make me want to have one.  Highway
driving is no problem for me.  It&rsquo;s just the squirmy little streets
near our house that I don&rsquo;t want to navigate in a car (especially not
a relatively big ass mini van like we have).</p>

<p>Mikako brought her dog Kodama &ldquo;little ball&rdquo; who has been quite quiet,
far surpassing my expectations when I heard she would be joining us.
She has uttered nary a bark nor moved from her designated pad on the
seat.</p>

<p>I write journal entries with Emacs because I never learned vi.
Anyway, I just tweaked my journal creation macros to use templates
instead of embedded strings.</p>

<p>Much easier to tweak and easier on the eyes.</p>

<p>Next step is to make a macro for episodes on my new website
marbletrack3.com</p>

We were in a B52 that for some reason had to crash so they were going
to simply move all the refrigerators from one side to the other so it
would go off balance and plummet down at an angle, ensuring its
destruction so the enemy would not be able to use anything from it.

<p>I am trying to use <a href="https://github.com/mattstratton/castanet/">castanet</a> but cannot get it to show blog
entries.</p>

<p>I guess I should more carefully read the <a href="https://github.com/mattstratton/castanet/blob/master/REFERENCE.md">docs for castanet</a>.</p>

<p>One problem was having tags listed not in quotes.   I had to change
this</p>

<p>tags: [ &ldquo;mt3&rdquo; ]</p>

<p>to this</p>

<pre><code>tags: [ &quot;mt3&quot; ]
</code></pre>
