<p>So much funny stuff!</p>

<p>So much awesomeness!</p>

<p>Saying hi to Jason's mom Kathy who was looking for Jason and when I
found him for her in the YA meeting, they were discussing how to get
Ice T as a speaker at a workshop.  Other options included Coolio, oh
shit I forgot, but it was a funny list.  Claire has the notes.</p>

<p>Hilarious with Rosemary stealing my nametag to become me, and
Edward talking about more cartoons and Krista (sp) joining me and
several youth to watch Anthony explain in terms of circles and French
flags (no green available) how he could dilute his genes over some
generations to have offspring 100% Italian, and suddenly a game of
pictionary breaking out of that including Sam drawing an instantly
recognizable hangman thing so he changed it and just drew until what
he was drawing begin to look like what we were saying and then saying,
"yes! that's it!" when someone said, "intestinal system of a worm!"</p>

<p>Dinner talking to Jim, a minister at New Orleans' new church,
telling me how he's been practicing yoga off and on for 33 years, and
who noticed me sitting all yoga-like at the service this morning, and
finally, finally me finding someone who described the same type of
thing that I experience of being able to listen to a higher self, a
spiritual connection to god and know what needs to be done.  He said
he might be sitting in meditation and suddenly know he needs to leave
for the city council meeting right now, and not know why, but know
that he needs to play some role there, whatever it may be.</p>

<p>Then talking to The Real Frank Roesler Experience, who is taking
statistics classes and who wants to do something in statistics and to
Claire Sexton, who just got back from a several week trek to Europe on
Euro-rail pass, staying with friends of friends in different houses
and sometimes in hostels and having a blast and a half.</p>

<p>Talking to Cindy from Amarillo, which is 3600 feet elevated on a
big flat arid plain where they have to plant trees and import water to
have anything but a desert.  Then answering questions for Crystal and
Krista and Kellie, some about what the heck I am doing in the world
(who is this Rob character anyway?) and answering questions about YRUU
and can I come to Springfield (I'd like to be the Knight In Shining
Armor, but YAC can handle it) to help?</p>

<p>And now I'm basically caught up.  Dance tonight.</p>

<p>Brilliant parable where a rabbi told the head monk that "one of you
is the Messiah."  So each of them wondered "who could it be?"  and all
started treating eachother with more respect, just in case <em>he</em>
was the Messiah.  And, "just in case <em>I</em> am the Messiah," each
person began to treat others with the respect a Messiah would
give.</p>

<p>Ended up that the place became more vibrant and began to grow
again, as visitors felt revered.  The monestary grew and flourished.
This was the gift of the rabbi to the monestary.</p>

<p class=date>8:52am</p>

<p>Nathan (with a goatee!) and LaUURYn just walked in. :-)  Great to
see them again!</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>An interesting point is being made that our news media headlines
are all poopy, but our religious hymns have lines of hope and love and
beauty.</p>

<p class=date>9:03am</p>

<p>Okay, that was a bearable adult worship.  A funny thing is that
just as we got into the song "Now let us sing," with the men singing
the low and women on the high parts, with people groovin' and movin'
and having a great time, the song got to its fourth verse and ended.
A youth version would have gone until the song ran itself out, with
people just shouting a word to use in the last line before the verse
started.  So strange to have the energy of the room <em>just</em>
beginning to be riled up and then... <em>bang</em> no energy, that was
too scary, let's sit down.</p>

<p class=date>9:13am</p>

<p>Haha: "... will get to keep this plaque for a year until we award
the 199--, uh 2003 anti-racism award."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Ironic that after six years of work, she is getting an award and I
am getting kicked out.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Wow.  My mom is getting an award.  Good job, Ma!</p>

<p>For serving two congregations for a while and newsletters and
columns and stuff, always promoting UU principles.</p>

<p>So I went to the musical performance and found it to be jazzy and
bouncy sometimes, slow and sultry sometimes, smooth and bluesy
sometimes.  Danceable most of the times.  I whirled around a bit with
Frank and just perfectly twirled out of his hands and bowed to him
*just* as the song ended.  Couldn't have done it better had I ever
heard the song before.</p>

<p>Danced around alone for some songs, with a variety of styles (one
per song) and suddenly remembered that Claire is one of the three
chartreuse buzzards who sitting in a dead tree full of ants at San
Antonio some years ago!  So I've run around the church looking for her
and was suddenly inspired to tell Nancypant's grape joke to Heather,
the cutest chef in the world.</p>

<p>Suddenly taken by sadness and realize that all my bouncy energy may
be just covering the sadness that is burrowed within me about leaving
YRUU, possibly prematurely, and fear around my western state
adventure, which is totally ridiculously silly, but I do need to start
contacting some mofos that I think I may find along my journey.</p>

<p>Sigh.  And here I am.</p>

<p>D'oh!</p>

<p>I just realized that Janette asked me to deposit her check for
her.  I forgot.  I doubt the banks are still open.</p>

<p>I just woke up from sleeping on a set of chairs near the band.
What was their name?  Something like Jimmy James and the New Turk
Band.</p>

<p>So sad that Edward and Casey are <em>bored</em>.  Bored!  How can
they be bored when there are so many people to talk to and so much
space to sit thoughtfully or meditatively, and so much paper on which
they may draw or write.</p>

<p>An infinite number of games and activities await, and they feel
bored.</p>

<p>When Lilly saw Matt she was all, "holy shit dog, you need to eat!"</p>

<p class=date>11:24pm</p>

<p>I helped Amy and Josephine design the worship.  Josephine pretended
to not feel very loved, so I said, "aaww Josephine, I like you.." in a
fake mocking tone.  She goes, "thanks, whatever."  HAhahahah!</p>

<p class=date>1:00am</p>

<p>After Kate from Little Rock had a drink of Groovy Juice: "Takes
like shit.  Thanks." and the thanks was not meant sarcastically.</p>

many problems during my term as treasurer or president..."</p>

<p>Meara's dad Joe chose either Eeyore or Piglet as his favorite super
hero.</p>

<p>Rick: "My favorite <em>favorite</em> superhero is Josephine."</p>

<p>Josephine (in her cute voice): "I'm eating an elephant."</p>

<p>Josephine had chosen Power Puff Girls as her favorite.</p>

<p>Debu chose Scooby Doo as hers, and Josephine goes, "he's a cool
<em>cat</em>."</p>

<p>Worship was lovely.  I cried a bit during it, thinking about how
these are the last times that I'll hear Amy on her harp for a while,
how these beautiful youth will continue to fight for the right to
play, worship, lead, learn, chill as they wish, how very soon I will
be saying my last goodbyes to some of them forever.</p>

<p>How beautiful today that I was able to handwrite both sides of a
page with answers to questions asked and questions unasked for
Leigh(sp), a new advisor.  After I expressed my appreciation for that
gift, she expressed thanks to be the recipient.</p>

<p>Fun ticklefight broke out with Katy, Susie, Joel.  Joel pinned
Susie with Katy on top of him, so I chose to join and pulled both Joel
and Katy off, and was nearly able to pull them both onto me, but
couldn't quite.  I discovered that Joel is more ticklish than Katy.
Fun stuff.</p>

<p>Maybe Silent Football now.</p>

<p class=date>12:57am</p>

<p>Matt and Jared just made Groovy Jice for the Arkansas youth.  Jared
drank six ladles worth, where one ladle is a single serving.</p>

<p>Had been talking with Steve Caldwell and Ellen, one of the advisors
from Little Rock.  Steve went to sleep about an hour ago, and I
continued chatting with Ellen, telling old talent show stories (root
beer guzzling (Austin Roth, Nick Carter, Shira, me, at OKC a couple
years back), gum chowing (Jason and me at Houston 2000 I think)) and
answering questions in general.</p>

<p>Got off onto Silent Football discussion somehow, and she asked how
to play.  I gave her quick version of the rules (and let me tell you,
if people will sit quietly and pay attention, the rules can be
described in about 5 minutes) and even described the wormholes, and
was able to show how Sam could fwap to her, and then I shrug and the
football lands on the chair. (Assuming Sam could play while snoring,
and a chair could play while just sitting there)</p>

<p>I appreciate her listening to my stories.</p>

<p>She went to bed and now I am going soon too.</p>

<p class=date>3:09am</p>

<p>Okay, I'm going to bed.  It appears that I'm the last one
standing.</p>

<p>Showed Jack what I've done so far on the comment entry thing.  It's
1/3 done i'm guessing, not counting creating a concept of logging in.</p>

<p>Jack and I have just arrived at the Wolf Shop, a tad early so we're
chillin' outside.</p>

<p>Ann just drove up.  Jack is working with her today.</p>

<p class=date>8:23am</p>

<p>Hector sounds like he's drunk today, but sometimes it's hard to
tell with him.  I asked where he was going today (does he want a ride
with me to prestonwood, and he was all, "I'M GOin' with JOHNny to the
WHITE house...."  and he meant warehouse, but it sure sounded like
whitehouse.</p>
