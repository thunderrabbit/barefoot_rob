<p class=date>10:09am CST Sunday 14 January 2001</p></p>

<p>I had never seen such a horrible display of disrespect in all of
YRUU.  Never ever.</p>

<p>I had no idea what to do; I was shocked.</p>

<p>I tried to talk to the offending youth, but they wouldn't
listen.</p>

<p>I called an emergency YAC meeting and told them the situation.
Through much deliberation, it was decided the youth could not attend
the next rally.  (Plano in March or so)</p>

<p>I trust that it is all for the best.</p>

<p>Details:</p>

<p>"Are you someone good that I can talk to about something that
happened?" came a voice from behind me.</p>

<p>I turned to find Elizabeth was totally crying, sobbing.</p>

<p>I said, "yes," and thought, "oh, not again...."</p>

<p>"I have never stolen anything in my life, because I think stealing
is wrong, and I would never do that.  I found a button on the ground
yesterday and I liked it so I put it on my bag, and Christina came up
to me, and I don't even know how she found out that I had it and she
asked if I had her button.  So I asked her to describe it because
that's what I've seen peopledo when they find something is have
someone describne it and then they know it's thers.    She said that I
stole it off of her bag, and for all I know the button was a mass
produced button, and hte one I found could ahave been a different one,
and the on that was hers could still have been on her bag.</p>

<p>"Christina always yells at me and she always gets away with things
and no one ever does anything about it, and I don't know if it's
because I'm new cause I've only been going to these rallies for a
year, or if she pickes on my because I cry easily.  I try not to cry,
but sometimes I just can't stop it when it starts and I just cry."</p>

<p>"I hear you."  I was hardly able to say that before she spoke more.</p>

<p>"It's just not fair that nothing happens to her, she always picks
on me and nothing ever happens to her.  If you're not the right person
then just tell me who is..." She had her face in her hands
sobbing.</p>

<p>"Would you be willing to talk to her?" I asked, hoping to allow the
youth to resolve the issue.</p>

<p>"No.  I don't even want to see her or talk to her because she is so
mean to me."</p>

<p>"Okay..  I hear that."</p>

<p>"I mean this is an attack on my moral character.  I'm a good person
even thought I don't like myself, there is no reason that .  I mean
this is the place I go to get a way from that kind of stuff.  In
school I can handle it, but I shouldn't have to here."</p>

<p>I didn't really know how to resolve it, and I really thought that
Elizabeth was blowing up the issue in her mind.</p>

<p>I saw Christina walk up.</p>

<p>"Okay," Christina began, "Grantly told me that you had my button
and I had checked my bag at 10pm, knowing that buttons can get knocked
off, and they were all on.  And now this morning, you have my button,
and it makes me wonder where you got it."</p>

<p>"I don't steal things because it's wrong, and I can show you the
exact spot on the ground where I found it."</p>

<p>"Honey,..."</p>

<p>"Christina," I cut her off.  "Wait, just listen."</p>

<p>Christina listened to more of the same, plus, "I don't know why
people don't like me, I don't know if there's people who don't like
me but if there is then I would like to talk to them."</p>

<p>"Oh, honey," Christina with a false frienship voice, "would you
like the grand tour?"</p>

<p>I got in front of Christina so I was literally between Christina
and Elizabeth, and I put both hands on Christina's shoulders.  "Do you
hear that she is saying she found it on the ground?  I just want you
to simply hear that."</p>

<p>"Oh I hear it, but I don't believe it."</p>

<p>Oh gosh.</p>

<p>"She totally bashes on vegans for no reason, and </p>

<p>- - </p>

<p>"She draws pictures bashing vegans.."</p>

<p>"that's my art!"</p>

<p>"yes, honey, but in a <em>church?</em>"</p>

<p>"Yes, in a church, and if someone has been going through my drawing
pad then maybe there something else that they ought to be doing."</p>

<p>"You gave me your website.  I saw them on your website."</p>

<p>"Only because you asked for it."</p>

<p>No you said, "I have a website and I said oh really and you gave it to
me.  And your art is beautiful, but honey, in a church?"</p>

<p>"Please don't call me honey.  It sounds patronizing."</p>

<p>"I call everyone honey."</p>

<p>- - - </p>

<p>"Christina," I had her attention again, "I remember when I first met
you."  I imagined I could see the scared girl behind her emotionless
face.</p>

<p>"Oh, I do too," she smiled sarcastically.</p>

<p>- - - </p>

<p>"Listen, I have to things to do."  and she whirled around and walked
inside, and I turned around to find Elizabeth even more shocked and
crying so hard she was nearly gagging.</p>

<p>I held her, "I love you, Elizabeth."  I was in shock.  I didn't know
what do to.</p>

<p>"I need to get some water."  She did and came back outside.  Gram and
I consoled her and told her that Christina should not have done any of
that.  </p>

<p>I told Elizabeth that I would bring it up with YAC.  I'm on YAC and I
will talk to them.</p>

<p><P>Susie (advisor) came up and talked to see what was going on.  We all
went inside because it was cool, and I felt freezing.</p></p>

<p>Susie did most of the talking, acknowledging Elizabeth's feelings and
helping her navigate them.  Then Elizabeth went to talk more with
Gram.</p>

<p>I had no clue what to do.  "What are you thinking?" ask Susie.  </p>

<p>I'm considering calling Christina's parents.</p>

<p>I think it needs to be dealt with now.  Do you think we should pull
her out of closing circle?</p>

<p>I balked.  "I don't know."  I really didn't want to.</p>

<p>"I mean, I think that the situation just now happened, and it should
be taken care of as soon as possible."</p>

<p>That made sense to me.  We walked over to where the closing circle
was, found Christina on one side.</p>

<p>I felt fear.  I was stepping into the unknown.  I almost told Susie,
"I'm afraid."  But I didn't tell her.  I just went over and stood
beside Christina, reached my hand down to help her up.  She didn't
move.</p>

<p>I crouched down in front of her.  "I would like to talk with you."</p>

<p>"Don't tell me that girl is going to ruin this for me."</p>

<p>"I'm not saying that at all.  I want you to hear that I have never
seen such disrespectful behavior in YRUU.  I have never ever seen
anyone be so disrespectful ever in YRUU."</p>

<p>"Listen, I don't want to miss closing circle."</p>

<p>I could hear them announcing the mugbooks.  "You've seen them give out
mugbooks before."</p>

<p>She was looking over my shoulder to ignore me.  I felt my anger and felt
her disrespect.</p>

<p>"Look, I'll be glad to stay and talk for as long as it takes
afterwards; I don't care."</p>

<p>I thought about this, wondering how that would affect her ride.  "How
did you get here?"</p>

<p>"I drove," she said defiantly.  "I have my car here and I'm going
to drive home."</p>

<p>I chose to not even mention that youth driving was expressly forbidden
by the rules of this rally, and she knew that rule.</p>

<p>I had no intention of staying, talking for hours to Christina about
it.  She could just ignore me for 5 hours and accomplish nothing.</p>

<p>They called for the equivalent of senior circle.  Christina got up to
attend, crushing the conversation with me.</p>

<p>Uh oh.</p>

<p>Crisis; what do I do?</p>

<p>I scanned the outside edge of the circle, looking for YAC members.  I
saw Sean.  "I need to talk to YAC right now," I told him, helping him
stand up.  Sean clarified and then helped me gather YAC members.  "Out
of the circle?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>I saw Elizabeth in the circle.  God I hated to do this.  I approached
Elizabeth from behind in the circle.  "I'm sorry, Elizabeth I need you
right now," as I pulled her out of the group hug as they sang Good
Friends.</p>

<p>YAC promptly followed me out of the room to the hall, having zero idea
what to expect, but knowing it was something big; I would never pull
them out of closing circle.</p>

<p>"I have just witnessed the most horrible disrespect I have ever ever
seen in YRUU."  I told them the situation, told them I had just tried
to talk to Christina, and she offered as many hours as needed after
closing circle.</p>

<p>"We don't have hours," Sean pointed out.</p>

<p>"I know.  And I don't know what to do.  Christina apparently has 2
rallies left, and I can't just kick her out of both of them."</p>

<p>The look of dismay on all YAC faces proved this was significant.</p>

<p>"We'll just say she can't go to Plano."</p>

<p>"How can we enforce that?  We'll essentially have to tell that
church.."</p>

<p>"I'm helping plan that rally," said Matt.</p>

<p>"So does everyone agree?"</p>

<p>"Yes.  The rules are there for a reason, and we can't just let people
break them with no consequences."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>The YAC went to tell Christina.  I went to tell Elizabeth.  She looked
utterly shocked.  Someone had actually listened to her.</p>

<p>- - - </p>

<p>Few minutes later Laura asked if I could help with Christina.  I went
over and they were all just in a circle with her in it.  Emotionless
faces.  I didn't know what had been said already.</p>

<p>Christina: "Okay, so y'all gotta tell me what's going on."</p>

<p>Ah - they haven't told her anything yet.</p>

<p>Sean put his arm around her, "We have the rules in place to help make
the community, and you broke the rules.  We have decided to not let
you come to Plano."</p>

<p>Brief instant of shock and then she walked away without speaking.</p>

<p>- - - - -</p>

<p>Only several minutes later, I talked to Nick, who said the
punishment was too strict; "sometimes Christina was just like that;
you know how she can be."</p>

<p>I acknowledged what he was saying, and described the interactions as
they occurred, and what YAC decided to do about it.  I know there will
be a ton of emails about this.  We acted quickly to do what we thought
was best for the community.</p>

<p>I invited Gram to write down his version of the story.</p>

<p class=date>5:12pm CST Sunday 14 January 2001</p></p>

<p>Laura just called inviting me to eat dinner with her.  I was so
dead asleep that she sent me back to sleep, "it's okay.  Go back to
sleep."  I lay there a bit and realized that I would love to eat
because I haven't eaten today, and because I would love to talk to her
about the weekend.</p>

<p>I don't get the chance to see Laura very often; I would be silly to
pass up an opportunity.  I don't know what time it is. But I'll guess
5pm..   oooh 5:14.  pretty good for sleepy rabbit.</p>

<p class=date>7:41pm CST Sunday 14 January 2001</p>

<p>Souper Salad with Laura allowed me to tell someone the story of
disrespect, and she supported the decisions that were made as a
result.  I greatly appreciate having been able to talk to her.</p>

<p>She told me about her latest adventures with trying to teach her
grandmother about computer stuff, and explaining how it's possible
that she has two hard drives.  "If I had more time, I would have taken
the computer apart to show her."</p>

<p>Lovely conversation; so great to see Laura.  But I'm still tired
and I'm going back to sleep.</p>

<p class=date>4 something am Sunday 14 January 2001</p></p>

<p>These are quotes from Silent Football, when Nick was Dictator:</p>

<p>"dry miss llama's big ol' llama tears.."</p>

<p>"Mrs person two places to my right has very effectively fwapped a
fwap fwap."</p>

<p>"Mrs Amanda receives 1/2 penance point for causing Mr Penis such
unwanted distress."</p>

<p>"Miss Llama would also like to see some ballplay."</p>

<p>"The Bowels of Antiquity have been flatulating belches in my direction."</p>

<p>"One is a number, as Miss Llama so effectively pointed out... with
the aid of Miss Llama's hooves."</p>

<p>"Bowels of.. no."</p>

<p>"It them she! It them she! It them she! It them she! Unquote!"</p>

<p>"How many penance points does the Bowels of Antiquity have wedged up
in there anyway?"</p>

<p>"Miss Lady Jesus is an honest man."</p>

<p>"Princess Cat hrmm hrmm"</p>

<p>"Mr Dick hrmm hrmm, Princess Cat Safrass.."</p>

<p>"My gratitude doesn't extend to delinquents and mal contents."</p>

<p>"What is the quote Room to which Big Sexy is referring?"</p>

<p>"Mr Dictator, Mr Dick wants some ball play."</p>

<p>"Far be it for me to stand in the way of a dick and his balls."</p>

<p>By this time in the game, Nick had received 3 penance points, and
transferred the Dictatorship over to me.  Because I was dictator, I
didn't write down quotes, but I remember a couple:</p>

<p>"Dictator number two (holding up left hand) awards Dictator number
one (holding up right foot) one half penance point for not explaining
the relationship between Fwaps and Schrodems"</p>

<p>"Miss Llama will hereinafter be known as Miss Llama S D, and may
speak only while dancing."</p>

<p>[zoom] [fwap] [fwap] [fwap]</p>

<p>At 6am (time to wake up and clean up), I declared the game complete
and suggested the punishment be Reverand It Them She exorcising The
Devil out of Mister Smoochy during closing circle.  I don't know if
that actually happened, but the game was great.</p>

<p>Wende is home and I told her the story.  Amazing how I am
practically unable to simply gently reminisce about the rally; I just
think about Elizabeth and Christina.</p>

<p>I'm in a weird state of being tired and not tired.  I'm surprised
that it's 11pm; it doesn't seem that late.  It feels like 9pm to me
now.  Interesting after I was so close around 5pm.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>

                        <p><title>Houston Rally part 3</title>
<p class=date>10 pm CST Saturday 13 January 2001</p></p>

<p>Jason was all, "want to go in there [with the band]?"</p>

<p>"Naw, this music is dumb to me."</p>

<p>"Yeah, and that's why we can dance dumbly to it."</p>

<p>"Cool!"  So we went in as The Rob and Jason Circus.  Some of our
tricks:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Jason leap frogged over me while I was standing up</p></li>

<li><p>Jason leaped up to sitting on my shoulders</p></li>

<li><p>From sitting on my shoulders, Jason twisted somehow so that we
linked our elbows while back to back, with Jason upside down.  (with
his head turning purple according to one observer)</p></li>

<li><p>Both standing on the ground, we linked elbows and alternated
legs in the air, then legs on the ground, while spinning
around.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Super fun stuff!  A small loose mosh pit with no distinct border
formed for a while, blowing off energy of some of the other youth.  I
acted as a barrier and kept them from bouncing too far out of the
area.</p>

<p class=date>11pm</p>

<p>Phat Pat showed me how he melted some of the Mardi-gras beads into
a cool clear colorful "Pat" shape.  I and a couple other youth made
various designs, but there was too much stink and smoke whafted out of
the oven when we opened it to make any more.</p>

<p class=date>12am Sunday 14 January 2001</p>

<p>Rob and Jason Circus to the max</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Me on my back, Jason did the airplane (like Minnie Driver in
Gross Pointe Blank (sp)).  He pretended to swim like a frog which
cracked me up.</p></li>

<li><p>Me on my back, Jason tried several times to stand on my feet,
but he said I was too bouncy.</p></li>

<li><p>Jason on my shoulders, then he climbed up to standing on my
shoulders.</p></li>

<li><p>Jason standing on my calves leaning way forward as I walked.
That was funny.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I was collapsed in a fit of giggles and Jason stood on my back as I
was trying to do push ups.  That didn't work.  Then I was on all fours
and he rode on my back as I thudded like a big bulldog walking through
a field of legs.  I was on my knees and elbows, so I couldn't see
anyone until I was bumping their feet.  Pretty much they moved out of
my way.  I stopped and Jason was all, "no, keep going!" and I could
feel he was turned around backwards with his feet pointing forwards
and I bumped into some feet that said, "Hi Rob."</p>

<p>Jason was fully backwards and balanced and I slowly stood up, so we
were locked at the elbows, back to back, Jason upside down.</p>

<p>I saw who had addressed me.  "Hi Terry!  Hi Mary!"  They were here
to help watch the rally so the advisors could sleep.  Jason was still
on my back.</p>

<p>I said HI to them a bit and then tilted forward so Jason could
stand on the ground.  I could smell my STINK.  I hadn't changed or
showered since Friday morning.</p>

<p>Wende and the rest of SWUUSI staff just finished their meeting.
She and I stood outside as she cried because she was not in Austin
with her sister Stacey as Stacey had her first baby, and the first of
this generation in our families.  She had had to be at the SWUUSI
meeting, and had to be back at work in 8 hours.</p>

<p>I moved the motor to the moonwalk out of the rain.  The moonwalk
delivery guys said we didn't have to worry about the actual moonwalk
getting wet - just the motor.</p>

<p>Worship has thoroughly started, and I'm walkin' around making sure
everything seems cool throughout the rest of the rally.</p>

<p class=date>1am</p>

<p>Worship still. Some peeps are being loud as shit not too far away,
so I encouraged them elsewhere.  Jason, who said he was leaving a
while ago, is still debating drug legalization with Nick and
Jeffery.</p>

<p class=date>1:15am</p>

<p>Big rain outside, still worship, people sharing how rallies affect
their lives so positively and acceptance and how they are allowed to
be themselves here, and therefore have the courage to be themselves
elsewhere.  (That the conglomerate of what most people were saying,
according to one observer who left the worship.)</p>

<p class=date>1:30am</p>

<p>Worship over, kitchen comes to life with people pouring into it.</p>

<p>"That's the Groovie Juice??  God, I thought they were trying to
soak out the chili," exclaimed Ben, looking at the pukey brown color
with white floaties in it.  (basically strong Tang with non-dairy
creamer in it)</p>

<p class=date>1:33am</p>

<p>Talent show now.  Amy playing harp is the first talent.</p>

<p>I helped sing the second talent with Ryan and Nicole:</p>

<pre>
I hate my period
More than most things
It comes at bad times
and at worse times
fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you die
</pre>

<p>We sang it once as a round.</p>

<p class=date>1:40am</p>

<p>Steve performing Rocky Raccoon</p>

<p>I slept through the next guitar thing, and I think David and Joan
swing dancing.</p>

<p class=date>1:57am</p>

<p>Grantly the star of a french sound track thing about a burlesque
house I think.</p>

<p class=date>2:25am</p>

<p>I was snoring during Stevie's guitar and Hethre laughed, and Lilly
was all, "Rob, you're snoring, dog.  Rob, you're snoring..."  I woke
up all "damn..."</p>

<p>Now Heidi reads her poetry.</p>

<p class=date>3:15am</p>

<p>I've been sleeping through talents and just got up.  Ryan asked if
I wanted to play Silent Football, but I could not possibly start a
game while the talent show is going on.  That would be entirely
rude.</p>

<p class=date>4:00</p>

<p>Talent show over, and thank God for the youth who helped clean the
kitchen "while you're awake, before we play Silent Football, and I
promise it will be so much easier now while you're awake than in 2
hours after you've been sleeping."  In quick order they tidied it up
and took out the trash and stuff, while I told the Koosh Joke.</p>

<p>I cut the joke pretty short, cause by halfway through, they were
all just watching me and not cleaning.  It's all good though; the
kitchen looked relatively great.</p>

<p>Now we are seated around the ping pong table in the local youth
group's room.  Nick is Dictator for Silent Football.  We don't have
enough time for two games, and this is his last rally.  So he will be
dictator until someone reaches 3 points and then I will be
dictator.</p>

<p class=date>6:30am Saturday 13 January 2001</p>
<p class=note>(adapted from notes that I took)</p></p>

<p>Rally is going great.  I arrived after work around 6pm to find some
Houston youth here, getting stuff together.  I created a sign that I
taped between the podiums in the sanctuary.  It spanned the entire
thirty feet or so across the three steps leading up the stage.  It
said in large block letters</p>

<p><h1 class=black>FALSE.</h1 class=black></p>

<p>I was quite entertained with myself.</p>

<p>I felt perfectly not nervous leading the advisor meeting at 10pm.
I just explained what I thought was our role at the rally and answered
a few questions and that was it.  Essentially identical advisor
meeting at 1:AM for the later arrivals.</p>

<p>Just after OKC people arrived, at 3:30am or so opening circle went
well and we handed out the scrubs afterward and ran out of Smalls and
had too many Larges.  Elizabeth and I both snagged a pair of Larges
for Bryn.</p>

<p>Touch group meeting was cool and seemed to be great for each group.
Our group played Dead Fish, my current favorite ice-breaker game.
Super duper thanks to Meg for creating touch group leader packets!</p>

<p>This rally is kicking so much ass everywhere. Oh - and we had zero
walk-ins!</p>

<p>Studying the mugbooks really helped me remember names of all the
youth.  I will catch up and know all the youth's names by the next
rally.</p>

<p>Denise and I enjoyed listening to Channing's felony stories with
outrageous titles, such as "Conspiracy To Cross State Lines and
Discard Rubbish."  He was held in contempt of the court for clicking a
pen.  Eight felonies in Washington DC and one felony here in
Texas.</p>

<p>Laura had on 4 inch clonker shoes and because a professional shoe
remover.  She intimidated some of the boys by being too tall.</p>

<p>Laura's Yackity Yac rules with SWUUSI staff information.</p>

<p>Thumb war with Amanda turned into Global Domination and I ate soy
bars with Nicole, Alison, and friends.</p>

<p>Everything is perfect; I'm going to sleep.</p>

<p class=note>(adapted from notes that I took)</p></p>

<p>Aaron playing spy cam pulling Christina in a wagon as she held a
camera.  Aaron said they were looking for spys.  I pulled the wagon,
saying "where are those spys?"</p>

<p>Nick made the statue of a friar have a banana peel peeled in his
crotch & banana on the ground in front and labeled it "the forbidden
fruit?"</p>

<p>A youth stood on the bench near the friar and it broke.  The bench
was ridiculously old, so I told him really not to worry about it.</p>

<p>Random games inside and The Rentals CD on the CD player.</p>

<p class=date>9:40am</p>

<p>Soccer outside now.</p>

<p>We set up a game of 1/2 court soccer, so we wouldn't play in the
sopping puddles nor stomp the flower bed on one end of the minature
"field."  The game basically got too rough for me, so I sat on the
sidelines with Cassie and Joanna.  Laura has a stain on the knee of
her new scrubs.  Several youth came out of the game with numb-cold
bare feet and cuts and scratches on their feet from sticks on the
ground.  Ow.  That's part of the reason I quit playing.</p>

<p>Doh!  Cassie reminds me that Northwoods group is planning their
fundraising concert (punk rock show) at the same time as my KTRU
shift.  I will get a sub for KTRU; I wouldn't miss the results of my
youth group's labors for KTRU!</p>

<p>(It would be my last KTRU shift of the semester, and I don't know
if I'll sign up again for the same shift or a different shift or
what...  On one hand DJing is funner than shit, not to mention cooler
than shit to get calls from people who know me or who appreciate the
music or both, and on the other hand, I'm feelin' busy.  But c'mon!
It's only 2 or 3 hours every 2 weeks!)</p>

<p class=date>10:40am</p>

<p>Numbers are dwindling, and Jackie has out her camera.  Kevin is
sitting down with a bruised foot.</p>

<p class=date>10:51am</p>

<p>Ultimate frisbee in the parking lot and Sean got nailed head on.
He says, "I woulda caught that shit too!"</p>

<p class=date>11:35am</p>

<p>Awesome game with good throws and running.  Lunchtime now.</p>

<p class=date>12:pm</p>

<p>The moonwalk has arrived.</p>

<p>They are setting up for lunch - a Hunger Banquet, where we divided
into groups proportional to the numbers of people who have and have
not food in the world.  15 percent got a nice meal with salad and
meat, 30 percent got rice and beans, 55 percent got rice.  That sucks.
I'm super thrilled that the youth are helping with this awareness.</p>

<p class=date>2:15pm</p>

<p class=grafitti>Rob burps!</p>

<p class=grafitti>We sat around at a touch group meeting and
burped.</p>

<p class=date>~2 pm CST Saturday 13 January 2001</p>
<p class=note>(adapted from my notes)</p></p>

<p>We are starting the YAC meeting; it's my last or second to last
full real YAC meeting.</p>

<p class=date>3 pm</p>

<p>Youth are bouncing in the moonwalk as we are meeting.</p>

<p class=date>3:10pm</p>

<p>The youth talked about $40 being too high a price for a rally.  I
simply told them the price was youth-determined and we had the cool
things like scrubs, moonwalk, and band.  It was suggested that we
didn't have to have all that to make a cool rally.</p>

<p class=date>3:15pm</p>

<p>We're talking about the Power Shuffle at SWUUSI.  Laura almost in
tears: "I don't think SWUUSI is the same without the power shuffle,
like at all!"</p>

<p class=date>4:pm</p>

<p>Still talking about power shuffle.  See, it's a worship type thing
that <em>really</em> gets into the deeper sharing and emotional part
of the youth and brings them exceptionally close together.  Some
parents and people who are not there feel the event is too emotional
and not done in a safe environment.</p>

<p>We who are there say that it is a safe environment, with peers and
several fully trained professional therapists and psychological
workers available to help youth with issues that come up.  We contend
that the buried emotions must come out, and the Power Shuffle helps
that process; it doesn't create the issues - it releases them.</p>

<p>We're taking a break now.</p>

<p>Jason came to say HI!  We bounced around a bit in the moonwalk.
Cool to talk to him.</p>

<p class=date>5pm</p>

<p>Back in meeting now.  High energy brainstorm on how to respond to
the district board's concerns about the Power Shuffle.</p>

<p class=date>6pm</p>

<p>"It's time for YAC elections."  We are still in YAC meeting.</p>

<p class=date>6:20pm</p>

<p>Only one person ran for each position.  Meg Robinson is new Social
Action Chair, and Rick Bibby is new adult at large.</p>

<p class=date>7:20pm</p>

<p>YAC meeting again, selecting SWUUSI staff.  We just spent 3 or 4
minutes talking about Bryn.</p>

<p class=date>8:20pm</p>

<p>"Laura, we feel your best assets fit this position."</p>

<p class=date>8:33pm</p>

<p>Essentially finished selecting SWUUSI staff.</p>

<p class=date>8:43</p>

<p>Meg: "I can do that."</p>

<p>Us: "<em>YAAAAYYYYYYYYY!</em>"</p>

<p>Heather chose not to leave the band tonight, so she is declining
her position as SWUUSI mugbook person.</p>

<p>Hillary: "That's fine."</p>

<p>Us: <em>clap clap clap clap clap clap</em></p>

<p class=date>9:11pm</p>

<p>YAC meeting is finished.  We have a focus for talking to the board
about Power Shuffle, and we have chosen SWUUSI staff.</p>

<p>For about 10 minutes yesterday at work I hopped on
one foot instead of walking everywhere I went.  Just
for fun.  It was really tiring so I quit.  Karla said
I was shaking the whole building.</p>

<p>A few months ago, I found a golf ball in the ocean.
 A few days ago I cut this golf ball nearly in half,
so the halves are connected like a clam shell, or a
pac man.  Today I used a spoon and peeled off the top
rubbery layer of the golf ball.  Just for fun.</p>

<p>I'm in quite a happy mood, in anticipation of the
rally tonight.  A teeny sad thing is the screen on my
Handspring Visor has been blinking off randomly,
making typing on it weird, as if I'm typing using a
strobe light to see.  It seems to still work though. 
Weird.</p>

<p class=date>7:32am CST Thursday 11 January 2001</p>
<p class=note>(dream)</p></p>

<p class=dream>Walking across the hall to where some youth were
hosting a booth that sold pizza and had jungle gym bars on it, I
introduced myself and climbed on the jungle gym.  I had a flat
Bart-Simpson's-head-shaped eraser that I threw through the jungle gym
and it bounced out, onto the wall, and back into the jungle gym and
rolled back to where I was, in a totally surprising way.  We were all
"wow!" cause it was such a lucky shot.</p>

<p class=dream>The next time I tried it, the eraser bounced across the
hall, and back behind Joanne's booth, next to the wall.  I told her to
not be surprised by it when she takes down her booth; I would get it
when she packs up for the night.</p>

<p class=dream>Then I verified that I had logged off my computers and
Fred and I were chillin' in the pool, talking, telling jokes, just
floating in the water.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class=dream>Sitting at a big table with white lace tablecloth,
counting change with my dad's family, I discovered that not only were
the quarters different, but the dimes had different designs for each
state as well!  I was surprised that I hadn't previously noticed this,
and exclaimed to the group, "oh my gosh, the dimes are different!"</p>

<p class=dream>They already knew this, and misunderstood my
exclamation, thinking they were different <em>again</em>, and I felt
embarrassed after explaining my exclamation, and they were all, "oh, we
already knew that."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class=dream>My dad and I, and my cousin (dad's sister's daughter)
Barbie were examining trees on our plot of land, checking for
diseases.  They found ringworm on one of them, and I asked them to
show me what they were actually seeing.  The next tree was a metal
stove, and all the curves on it were too perfect to be caused by a
natural disease.  We looked inside the stove and found there was no
tree growing in it though.  My dad lit the stove, for more light, and
the fire kinda whooshed up at him, but he was okay.  We continued to
the next tree and found that it was disease free.</p>

<p class=dream>The dogs needed to be bathed, so Barbie took one
outside the enclosure to a lake thing across the street and bathed
it.  She came back and got the next dog, and let the recently bathed
dog just run around outside and become un-bathed.</p>

<p class=dream>Then we found a note on the next tree.  Someone wanted
to purchase it for $675.  Wow.  I wondered why, and who would want it,
and what they would do with it.  The tree was actually a <a
href="/journal/1998/costarica/bouncy_ride.html">bromeliad</a> growing
in a test tube, or a Dr Seuss three headed test tube contraption.
They had labeled one of the test tubes, and the remainder of the tree
was in a bigger test tube on the table.</p>

<p class=dream>In a wartime situation, on a beach, a man gave me a
package, but I knew it was a bomb, so I left it on the ground, and
grabbed a helicopter that was hovering nearby and it lifted me away
from the area.</p>

<p class=dream>As we were flying away, some of my buddies were
approaching the bomb, and I signalled them with hand semaphores that
it was a bomb, and they ran away as I was being flowing away and I saw
they were safely away from it when it exploded.</p>

<p class=dream>My grip was slipping on the side of the helicopter, and I fell,
dangling from the foot/skid/whatever that people dangle from in the
movies, and then climbed back onto it.  My pilot was a woman and we
flew way down low in some trees.</p>

<p class=dream>She told me the word of the day was
"misspoken communication," so i could say something like "mis-smokin
pommunication."</p>

<p class=dream>She flew me near some people sitting at an outdoor
wooden table, and I got off the helicopter.  I affected a German
accent, and asked, "me smokin?" pointing to their cigarettes.  A man
gave me a hand-rolled cigarette and lit it for me off his cigarette.
I started spouting something about the "pommunication satellites,"
pointing up at the sky.  They all nodded as if they understood, but
really were just being polite, I was sure.  I lay back on the ground,
wondering how to pretend I was smoking the cigarette, but not really
smoke it, so I just feigned falling asleep...</p>

<p>and I woke up.</p>
