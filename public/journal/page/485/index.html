<p>Leaving now for the annual beach cleanup with my youth.</p>

<p class=date>10:24 am</p>

<p>Wow! Rick & Joey Bibby and Will came!</p>

<p class=date>1:58 pm</p>

<p>We have just spent 1.5 hours combing across the beach, picking up bits of
trash.  Mostly plastic and rope and some tar.  Jack and I were paired; we
found five glo-sticks, and a length of rope nearly 50 feet long.  Jamie
jumped rope as Jack and I swung the rope as Will chanted "Cinderella,
dressed in yella, went upstairs to kiss her fella, made a mistake and kissed
a snake, how many doctors will it take... one two three...."</p>

<p>We saw a shark about 18 inches long and slightly dead.</p>

<p>We're going back to the front area now.</p>
<p class=date>2:30</p>

<p>I just got hollered at for climbing the relatively easily climbable wall
around the main office of Galveston Island State Park.  Pooh.  Good thing is
that I had made it completely to the top of the wall, so I know I
<em>could</em> have gotten on top.</p>

<p class=date>4:34 pm</p>

<p>Now we're all the way back at the church, and food is being prepared by
some adult volunteers.</p>

<p>Amy, Susie and I in swimsuitswater-hosed off outside.  Both of them
squirted water up their nose while rinsing off their heads. Silly silly.</p>

<p>I lay face down in the sun a bit to let my trunks dry while they changed
out of swimsuit into normal clothes.  Suddenly I heard them yelling, "Ahh!!
Get out!  Girls locker room!  Can't you tell???"</p>

<p>Poor Rick was slightly traumatized and ran off..</p>

<p>- - - - -</p>

<p>I just gave to Rick the big Amy-tooth-shaped tile that Jack and I found
on the beach.  It looks like a big shard of a roof tile, somewhat polished
by the sand and sea.</p>

<p>James and Grant guessed I was 42 years old when I was wearing my hat.
And when it's off, they guessed I am 22 years old.</p>

<p>The ride home was long...  60 minutes plus..</p>

<p>Food now.</p>

<p>Dr John Spear (sp) talking now about racism.   We'll be watching a video
in a moment.</p>

<p>Oh, for our social action, we'll be volunteering at a Special Olympics.
Awesome!</p>

<p>Arthur showed us a new game from Brazil, two players each try to hit the
feet of the other player with socks.  Not throwing, but a sock balled up in
a sock and swing socks to try and hit the other.  Fun game.  He said in
Brazil it's played with sticks.  Ouch!</p>

<p>Joey tried a bit to get the answer to the Infinite Questions we are
playing for the pastsome months.</p>

<p>Last night I watched Undercover Brother with Dude.  Quite funny, but I
couldn't help but see it was offensive genderwise and racewise.  And why
were there 95% non-black in the audience?  White, mexican, asian, but very
few black.</p>

<p>Is this movie *ridiculously* offensive and I just don't know it?</p>

<p>I'm open to input on this.  <a href="mailto:rob@robnugen.com">rob@robnugen.com</a></p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>At work Kevin had received a letter thouhgt it had been sent
to his wrong address and was forwarded to him.  He was surpised that anyoe
would have the old address considering how much mail he was getting on a
dialy basis.</p>

<p class=dream>I set out to desig a way to allow us to verify that a human
was writing him an email from the place online where the old address was
published.</p>

<p class=dream>This techniue involved setting up an array of days of the
week and reassigning numbers tto them randomly, and then asking the human
what day of the week it was, but then the reasignment woul assure that the
answere wasn't being given by a bot that had been programmed o know the days
of the week.  Or something like that.</p>

<p class=dream>I began to sketch out the technique and I needed to represet
7 people on a calendar, so I cut out images of seven differentt people fom
YRUU and randomly ut their images on the days of the wek on his calendar.  I
labeled 3 of them "Bass" and 2 of them "Tenor" and 3 of them "Alto"</p>

<p class=dream>I had just made them as examples to get my point across; the
labels could be anything we want.  But then Denise saw how I had leabeled
them and tok great offense at what I had done, but wouldn't come outt
clearly and say what was the problem.</p>

<p class=dream>I was like, "these are just examples, look I can relable this
one "Tenor" and now we have 2 bass, 3 tenor and 3 alto, but tthis is just an
example.</p>

<p class=dream>She was still upset, and I had no idea why.  Finally she was
all, "I can't believe you labeled this person as "Bass"</p>

<p class=dream>I'm like, I don't even know what bass means, I was just using
this as an example; I cut the images out randomly and it doesn't matter at
all.</p>

<p class=dream>We relabeled the name and then I thought about the whole
thing and I was really mad.</p>

<p class=dream>"<em>Now</em> I'm angry!" I got up.  we were outside on some
grass near a parking lot.  "I can't believe you would think I'd stoop so low
as to maliciously label someone bass!! "  I was yelling and furious.</p>

<p class=dream>Now I was yelling at my dad.  We were pacing around facing
each other like mountain lions in a standoff.</p>

<p class=dream>He started to smile at the irony of anger over such a little
thing.   I was still furious with my gaze burning into his eyes.</p>

<p class=dream>He said something as his point number one.  then he said, "I
wonder if I could punch you," and extended his fist slowly and it barely
touched my left eyebrow.</p>

<p class=dream>"You better not punch me I said," for I will wail the shit
out of you, I thought.  Then I realized it would be better to do nothing if
he punched me, so I was just about to say "for I will do nothing," but he
had stepped back about 30 meters before I could say it.</p>

<p class=dream>I stood my ground strongly in the standing yoga pose that I
spell tadasana.  My dad threw a punch at me so hard that his ring broke off
from his finger with a resounding CRACK and the top of the ring flew at me
and hit me.  I tried to dodge or block it, but it still hit me and stung a
little, but not too much.</p>

<p class=dream>I realized the skill he must possess to throw a punch into
the air so hard that it breaks his ring, so I clapped twice.  The kind of
clap that occurs in a movie when our protagonist is on stage practicing a
song and is so focused on the moment that they don't notice the one person
sitting in the otherwise empty audience, and when the song is over, the
protagonist's spell is broken by the slow clap of that one person.</p>

<p class=dream>I clapped slowly twice and then went to pick up the part of
the ring that had hit me and I woke up.</p>

<p>I went to the doctor yesterday with the complaint that my left
wrist/thumb has been hurting for the past two weeks with no apparent trauma
to have caused it.</p>

<p>She suggested that I get a wrist guard, which I didn't do because I
didn't want to pay for it, and I was in a mental battle of having just paid
$75 to get the advice; I might as well heed the advice, etc. and I made a
wrist guard to sleep in last night using a spoon, two tongue depressors and
an ace bandage.  That worked quite well, but I wanted to get a "real" wrist
guard before I go to my Amy's Ice Cream interview today, even though they
might just be impressed with the creativity of my custom built wrist
guard...  I visualized in my mind what a new wrist guard would look like,
and then I remembered I have already purchased wrist guards - two of them,
for skating.</p>

<p>So now I'm wearing my Pro Designed wrist guard.  It's quite substantial
and perfect for this task.   Good job, brain for recognizing that I had
these available.</p>

<p>Interesting to watch things falls to bits here at work.  Or it
seems that way at least.  Got in to work and learned that if I had
tried logging in as one of the participants, I would have discovered
that they couldn't add feedback providers.  I lied to Karla, saying
that I hadn't thought to look at that, but truth is I hadn't logged in
as them at all.</p>

<p>So that one got fixed but in the process of fixing it, I caused an
error due to dataset being opened exclusively (by me) to fix it.  Only
one error, but still that's not preferable.</p>

<p>And now I remember that we have staff meeting scheduled for noon
today (so that Dave and I can both attend, because we both work 1/2
time and he's working the latter half of the week and I'm working the
former half of the week (but somehow 1/2 + 1/2 adds up to an
overlapping meeting in the middle), and even though I do almost
nothing at the meetings, they want my poker face there.</p>

<p>I had scheduled a 1pm meeting at Paint This, and a 2:30pm meeting
at my doctor, and I should have been able to make the staff meeting
and those meetings as well.  But then Kevin asked me to come in at 4pm
today, so I figured I had extra time in the morning, so I shifted my
PT! meeting to 11am, not remembering staff meeting.  I felt anxious
(fearful) going in to tell Karla that I couldn't make the staff
meeting, but that was my choice (to not make it) instead of not go to
Paint This!.</p>

<p>I have just arrived home from Dude's, after doing some research online
and at Microcenter to get a Macintosh PowerBook G4 677Mhz/ 30 gig / 512 meg/
CD-DVD combo / AirPort / 15.2" screen for a bit less than $3000 including
tax, shipping.</p>

<p>I haven't purchased yet, but I'm close.</p>

<p>Just spent about an hour talking (mostly listening to) Mick, a man who
looks pretty much like a bum, but who has been traveling around the US for
over 30 years.</p>

<p>I asked if he was traveling.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>"Where are you headed?"</p>

<p>"From here, I don't know."</p>

<p>"Where have you been?"</p>

<p>"San Marcos, Austin, Little Rock, and now here."</p>

<p>"By what mode of transportation?"</p>

<p>"I ride freight trains," he said with a smile and glint in his eye.</p>

<p>Thus began the story.  He said he is rarely bothered if he doesn't ride
the Money Trains, those with expensive cargo.  But the others, like those
carrying sixty thousand pounds of grain, or concrete were perfect for
riding.  "What are you going to steal?" He explained.</p>

<p>He can generally tell where a train is headed given what it's carrying.
He said that many railyard workers will be glad to tell which train to ride
to get to a certain destination.  "The trick," he explained, "is to ask two
different workers at different times.  If they both indicate the same train
is headed for your destination, then that's your train."</p>

<p>A ten dollar bribe in Mexico will keep one out of a Mexican prison, which
is well worth the bribe.  Not many trains run in Mexico, so he advised
against train travel there when one is first getting started.</p>

<p>He says that people don't mind because he doesn't drink alcohol, and he
doesn't ride the Money Trains..  Makes sense to me.</p>

<p>(Drunks are likely to get hurt around trains, so the station has to kick
them out to reduce their liability.)</p>

<p>He was in Florida once and made it to California 5 days faster than a man
who hitch hiked the same distance.</p>

<p>He knows of places in the back woods that are 20 some miles from the
nearest highway.  No one comes out there, so they can hang out and fish for
weeks.  Wow.</p>

<p>I have an interview at Amy's Ice Cream tomorrow at 11:45am.  Wende and I
went to Amy's last night and were delighted to see Katherine Gray in line.
She was in an excellent mood; so many things in her life are lined up
perfectly.  So awesome!</p>

<p>She's got an exciting summer job lined up and all sorts of good
stuff.</p>

<p>I didn't get to show Wende my dinosaur diarama, but I imagine I can show
her once I have my job there.</p>

<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol><li><p>I lost 1/2 my job at work.  I'm still in mixed feelings about
this; I'm excited to have time off, afraid about money not coming in, sad
and angry about "<em>losing my job</em>," etc.</p>

<p>But I'm open to the possibility that I'll have enough money, and I'm also
looking at my life without fear and realize that no matter what, I'm still
okay, and all that.</p>

<p>No matter what, I'm still going to Japan next year, and I'm still going
to invest in a laptop Mac.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm researching purchasing a laptop Mac.  I want to get a nice one
15.1" display, 512megs ram, 50 gig hd, 677MhZ cpu, 133MhZ bus, AirPort, 10
base T, etc.  Personal coach Kim was all, "if it will increase your
productivity, then think of it as an investment instead of an expense."  I
quite think it will increase my productivity.</p>

<p>I've been talking to various peeps, and will be checking out display
models soon.</p></li>

<li><p>Ellen just moved in to the apartment next door.  When I first moved
in, I was all, "Hi Hi Hi" to everyone I saw, meeting a lot of peeps, etc.
</p>

<p>She was doing that as well, though I have almost completely stopped.  I
wonder if she will keep it up more than I have.</p>

<p>We talked with Alana, George, Andrea, and other neighbors for some hours
on the night I drove to Dallas for CYA and Bibbyfest.  I left a note on her
door Sunday night, inviting her to see a movie with me, but no response
yet.</p></li>

<li><p>I have an interview with Nova, a cool teach-english-in-Japan company.
Interview is in Austin on 20 June, my mom's birthday.  My bro's is the next
day, so I'll get to hang out with both of them on their respective days.
I'll also hang out with Madeline sometime in there.</p></li>

<li><p>My left wrist/thumb has been hurting a lot lately.  It feels like
it's bruised, but it has hurt for a long time.   I'm making an appointment
to maybe get it accupunctured.</p></li>

<li><p>I will be taking some more formalized Japanese classes soon.  This is
through a company that I found through Larry, the awesome cool guy and owner
of 1/4 Price Books across the street from my work.  I'm thankful for these
connections appearing in my life.</p></li>

<li><p>I have begun talking to people about doing website work again.  I
have been working on <a
href="https://www.blanketstoyou.com">www.blanketstoyou.com</a> and have
contacted Ridg to see if he needs more help on his PC.  I may help Kristen's
mom's PC as well.</p></li>
