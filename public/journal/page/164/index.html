<p>Lin and I joined Sarupapa and Sarumama at an event in Stopover Tokyo,
between 外苑前駅 and 表参道駅.  Several clothing designers were there,
looking all fashionable / weird.  I showed five of my drawings, most
of which were unnamed and not necessarily finished.  I offered to give
them to anyone who liked them.  Ended up giving away two:
<a href="https://art.robnugen.com/wd15"><em>White Dots</em></a> to Veero (not Vwero), and
<a href="https://art.robnugen.com/tr15"><em>東京路線</em></a> (which had had a working
title of <em>Three or More Circles</em>) to Madoka and Mitsuro.</p>

<p>I asked Lin to write the kanji on 東京路線, but after seeing it
written, I wished I had tried doing it myself.</p>

<p>As soon as we walked in to the first house, Lin was like, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go&rdquo;
because the pictures she saw didn&rsquo;t match the reality as well as she
hoped.  The house is located near the top of a small hill/culdesac
with pretty small room for manuevering to park.</p>

<h2 id="12-03">12:03</h2>

<p>The second house on our tour was much nicer.  It&rsquo;s bright, clean, and
has lots of storage.  But the bathroom area is a bit small.  The
street it&rsquo;s on is small, serving only the 11 (max, possibly only 9)
houses on it.  The cats would have a relatively safe place to be cats.</p>

<h2 id="12-30">12:30</h2>

<p>Lin is in the third house now, talking to the agent.  I&rsquo;m in the car
because we&rsquo;re not allowed to park on the street, so we&rsquo;ve got the
hazard lights on.  I&rsquo;m thinking our cats would not be particularly
safe here, unless they got smart about traffic.  There isn&rsquo;t a ton
right now, but this is like a 35mph zone, big enough for buses to
use.</p>

<p>Lin&rsquo;s been up there for more than five minutes would could just be due
to the sales guy, but might also be because she likes it.  I thought I
heard her happy voice upon entering.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s apparently a safe neighborhood for kids; there&rsquo;s been a
steady stream of them along the street and zero adults with them.  Ah;
one adult, but well over 200 kids I bet.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s 12:55, and Lin&rsquo;s coming down now. She&rsquo;s asking lots of questions
and negotiating with the guy.</p>

<h2 id="12-56">12:56</h2>

<p>I went up to check it out; it&rsquo;s pretty nice! A bit old, and Lin wants
to replace all the wallpaper and flooring(?) which I think is a bit
extravagant, but who knows if we&rsquo;ll even settle on this house.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s definitely the nicest of the three houses we saw today, but it&rsquo;s
right on a pretty busy road.  I think the traffic noise will be
annoying and the traffic noise makers might be deadly for the cats.</p>

<p class="dream">
There was some graffitti painted on the gate near the spies camp
inside the castle, something ke "The downfalll of W will be from the
camp of R on the inside", where W and R were the initials of the
family names involved.  I can't recall if R or W was the good guys,
but I was in favor of the good guys and we noticed that one man had
gone missing, and realized that he must have been converted to the bad
side, so I went off to find him and protect his girlfriend who loved
him but didn't know he would kill her.  I arrived at their compound
and read the graffiti then saw the girl standing outside.  I urged
her to run with me, but she was paralyzed with fear until he leveled a
crossbow toward her heart, and  I  took her hand as I ran away.  The
crossbolt didn't hurt us, and I put her inside my jacket for safe
keeping, and hid in a room when I heard some people nearby.  One of
them came into the room looking for a place to pee, and took a whiz
all over the floor in the room, but didn't notice me in the corner.
All of them came in, horsing around, and I wodered if I would (have
to) kill them as one of the flipped on the lights and I simply walked
away, hoping they would think I was a ghost or something.  They saw me
and were confused for long enough that I was able to jump out through
a window on the far side of the room.  I ran around a corner and jumped
up toward the celing where I was able to see the tops of the walls as
if the ceiling had been removed.  I thought that would be useful to
walk across them to escape"
</p>

<p>and I woke up</p>

<p>I bought the bear Lin wanted (after telling her repeatedly that I
would not).  It&rsquo;s been in a bag on the shelves next to my bed for
nearly a month I guess.</p>

<p>Last night before Lin got home, I took her oldest bear from its spot
in the living room and exchanged it with the new bear, which has
somewhat darker fur, but still &ldquo;light brown&rdquo; moreso that &ldquo;dark brown&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lin arrived hom and we sat on the couch to chat and she didn&rsquo;t notice
the bear!  Yay my plan worked!</p>

<p>After a while I was like, &ldquo;so when am I going to get my presents???&rdquo;
and she said &ldquo;close your eyes&rdquo; and gave me a cool headlamp with
rechargable batteries!</p>

<p>To present her with her present, I said, &ldquo;open your eyes,&rdquo; hoping she
might think to look at the bears whose sibling she wants.  She might
have, but didn&rsquo;t notice, her perception having been overwritten with
my having said I wouldn&rsquo;t buy her a bear this year.</p>

<p>She didn&rsquo;t see the bear and was like, &ldquo;surprise!  it&rsquo;s nothing!&rdquo; when
I said &ldquo;surprise!&rdquo; hoping she would see it.</p>

<p>After a bit I said &ldquo;okay close your eyes&rdquo; and went to get the new
bear&rsquo;s bag container her old bear and her other present, which I
presented first.  I sang a freestyle close your eyes song to the tune
of the Bangels&rsquo; &ldquo;Eternal Flame&rdquo;.. something like</p>

<pre><code>close your eyes,
hold out your hand
baby
and I will go get your present
do you understand
can you feel the anticipation?
I hope you enjoy your present
because it's the one
that I got for you
</code></pre>

<p>I hid the bear bag by the couch and gave her the flat present which
was wrapped with a photocopy of some English article I had used for my
students.  Lin tried reading that to determine what was inside, and
opened it after a that proved to reveal nothing interesting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surprise!&rdquo;  Super special massage coupon, featuring some black boxes
next to the names of the months.  She parsed it as I realized there
was nothing keeping her from drawing more squares on the thing..  and
then she was like, &ldquo;hey wait a minute! How long is the massage?  The
ones Travis gets for Yumi say how long the massage will be!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;one minute each!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What??&rdquo;</p>

<p>I ended the conversation by putting the bear bag in her lap.  She saw
the shop branding and was like, &ldquo;yay!!&rdquo; and hugged it.</p>

<p>The youtube video id is here: dNH7V7vXjTQ   Please don&rsquo;t post the vid on
social media.</p>

<p>So yeah, good times!</p>

<p>It was a cool movie with great effects, music, acting.  But the
writing left me shaking my head and hating it.</p>

<p>Nice time chatting with Kai yesterday at newly-re-opened CPK in
Lazona, over a nice five cheese pizza (though I couldn&rsquo;t actually
identify but three).  We talked a lot about men&rsquo;s group and she
expressed interest in women&rsquo;s work as well.  Nice!</p>

<p>In exchange for lunch, I made corrections to the English version of
her flyer (blurbs for 12 concerts at Muza)</p>

<p>Afterward, we walked to Tokyu Hands where I bought some sealant stuff
for the soap dish I made for Lin&rsquo;s mom.</p>

<p>On the way back to drop her off at work, we stopped by a CD shop to
find a CD of piano music.  I listenend to it with Lin, and she really
likes it!</p>

<p>The book says I can&rsquo;t copy it, but no mention of not copying the
accompanying runes</p>

<p><a href="//b.robnugen.com/journal/runes/runes_from_the_book_of_runes_by_ralph_h_blum.jpg"><img src="//b.robnugen.com/journal/runes/thumbs/runes_from_the_book_of_runes_by_ralph_h_blum.jpg" alt="rune stones from &quot;Book of Runes&quot; by Ralph H. Blum" /></a></p>

<p>Sweet.  Now I can just do this, &lt;span class=&ldquo;rune uruz&rdquo; /&gt;, and it
shows up like this:</p>

<p><span class="rune uruz" /></p>

<h2 id="21-29">21:29</h2>

<p>nice!  Now I can just do this, &lt;span class=&ldquo;rune uruz reversed&rdquo; /&gt;, and it shows up like this:</p>

<p><span class="rune uruz reversed" /></p>
