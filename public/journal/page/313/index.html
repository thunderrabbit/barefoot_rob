By Jove, you're right.  Absent sock-chipping technology, though, i'm
going to bleach "1L" and "1R" into the hem of one pair of socks with a
de-cottoned Q-tip, "2L" and "2R" into the next pair, and so on,
because my sock wardrobe is tangible proof of the principle of entropy.

If they have a bit of communication, then in the dryer socks can take
turns being magnetized.  You might get all your socks stuck to your jeans
zippers, but oh, well.

<p>I'm headed to Kawasaki now for two reasons</p>

<p>1) to see Matrix Revolutions</p>

<p>2) to get my keys from Tomoko, who was so nice to pick them up for
me from Suidobashi (not exactly next door to her crib or anything)</p>

<p>Mostly to see Matrix.  I'd otherwise get my keys tomorrow from
her.  I can crawl in through the window one more time no problem.</p>

<p>(After work, I opened the window, tossed my backpack in, jumped up
onto the window ledge and kneeled on it, then took off my shoes and
tossed them across my room to where they go and then jumped sock
footedly onto my bed.  Perfect manners, even for a possible cat
burglar.)</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Tomoko gave me my keys and smilingly led me to the entrance to
Dice.  Near there we saw a Japanese girl with a familiar face, but who
seemed too short to be that face - was it Rie the high school punk
bass player?  No, not quite right.</p>

<p>"She's a Nova student, too."</p>

<p>"I recognized her face; what is her name?"</p>

<p>"Keii."</p>

<p>No bells rang.</p>

<p>"Keiko.  She works in Cinecitta."</p>

<p>(ding).. (ding).. ding ding ding "Oh yeah, she goes to Keikyu Nova,
not Kawasaki Nova."  She wears <em>heels</em> at Keikyu, which
explains the height difference.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Interesting that Keiko seemed like a cat pawing at someone to see
if she is awake (to see if Tomoko is Tomoko); I can't quite explain
it, like Keiko didn't want to react first to the recognition of her
friend.</p>

<p>Then they burst into smiley chatter which ended in
Japanese-pronounced "mini-skirt" which each of them were wearing.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>"I heard you say "mini-skirt" at the end."</p>

<p>"Yes.  We are both wearing mini-skirts."</p>

<p>I agreed and specifically did not look.</em>

<p>"We often talk about movies and fashion.  And sometimes
boyfriends."</p>

<p>Once or twice after seeing a movie in Japan, I have warned people
"this gives away secrets of the movie blahblahblah" then realized
nevamind; it already came out in the US a long time ago.</p>

<p>But this time, though the movie has come out in the US, it has
<em>just</em> come out in the US.  It just came out everywhere.</p>

<p><h1>this gives away secrets and shit about Matrix Revolutions</h1></p>

<p>If you don't want any secrets stop reading now.</p>

<p>Stolen from <a href="https://www.thematrix.com/">thematrix.com</a></p>

<pre>
           Just over an hour ago, Larry and Andy Wachowski, Joel
           Silver, Keanu Reeves, and Jada Pinkett Smith found
           themselves in a theater in Shinjuku, Tokyo, introducing the
           film to a crowd of thousands. This was twenty minutes
           before the film was to start, because at the actual moment,
           on a platform outside the theater, a counter ticked off the
           seconds.  Raining, with a sea of Matrix code umbrellas
           dotting the crowd, Joel announced the weather fitting,
           considering the Super Burly Brawl in the film.
           
           At the moment of reckoning, lights flooded the surrounding
           area, soap bubbles and green tinsel confetti poured down,
           and inside the theater, the film began. Right now, in over
           20,000 theaters, in over 100 territories around the world,
           people are watching the third and final chapter in the
           Matrix trilogy.
           
           Updates are underway here at the site, but considering
           everyone should be in a theater about now, maybe we'll wait
           a beat...
           
           More shortly...

</pre>

<p>Nice.  I know that station.</p>

<p>(no I wasn't there for the opening described above)</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Sweet movie.  Pulled characters together and wound up the fight
scenes another notch, this time without building a freeway to crash a
bunch of cars on.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>The fight scene with the cats walking around on the ceiling as if
gravity meant nothing was pretty fly.  Good work with Trinity striking
the same pose as the first "wut da hell?" move in the first movie to
blast that guy upside down to smitherines.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Some of the lines were predictable.  But I liked a couple. </p>

<pre>
"If we're lucky, there'll be a guy checking for weapons."

"and if we're not?"

"There will be lots of guys."
</pre>

<p>That was predictable, but still good.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Trinity dying in the end makes it better for Neo to die, but I
still hoped for a way for them to escape.  I noticed the lines
blasting through her body as they crashed the ship into the robot
city.  I was like, "uh oh; that didn't look good."  (I wonder how good
it will look in slo-mo on DVD)</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>In the first movie I complained about the timing of the last
scene.  In short, Morpheus shoulda blasted the EMP before Neo got out
cause, he's Neo; he doesn't need the thing to jack into the Matrix.
How right was I?  Yep, the coma in which we find Neo in the last movie
is him jacked into the matrix without a jack.  I knew it.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Oh my god the shooting scene where the huge wearable robots taken
from the set of Aliens were blasting up at the pierced ceiling...
that was fine.   It outdid the lobby shooting scene in the first movie
and the Neo fighting every Smith guy in the second movie.  Totally
sweet.   Oh and it outdid the first movie helicopter shooting into the
building scene (which should have been bloodier, btw)</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>When Neo took off running (RIDICULOUS) to catch the train, he
should instead have Pulled a Neo and <em>BLASTED</em> toward the train
and then flown past the screen in that train station like 20 times in
3 seconds before he stopped and goes, "shit."</p>

<p>I mean hell they didn't even get the footsteps to match up
correctly; there's a break in them.  It's a fucked up scene.</p>

<p>Imagine, the seedy sweaty tooth ugly duckling triplet of the twins
from the second movie punches Neo then takes of in his crazy train, so
Neo is like, <em>Oh yeah, I'm going to fucking fly faster than
superman and kick your ass!</em> and he crouches down to fly and the
world goes "wubba wubba" in the cool circle pattern and the whole
audience goes, <em>uh oh, Buck's gonna start chewin' some gum,
man,</em> and Neo TAKES OFF after the train only to fwip fwip fwip
fwip fwip fwip fwip fwip past the screen like the pullstring on a
pull-down blind that just won't stay pulled down...</p>

<p>That would have been funny.</p>

<p>But they made him RUN after a <em>train</em> and fucked up the
sound effects of the footsteps in the process of showing it was
fruitless.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Classy that they didn't try to overtly outdo the multiple Smith
fighting scene.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Somewhat cheesy the way he talked to the matrix, but I have no
better solution.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>When the sentinels all split from Zion and the world had black cats
walking by twice (same sound effect btw) where was The Oracle chillin?
In the real world?  How did the sky get fixed that fast?  As I think
about it, she must be in the matrix, and that was the matrix sky
getting fixed.  But why would the matrix sky be fucked up just because
the robots and humans were fighting?</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Interesting that the sentinel used the same device to listen to the
matrix as it did to listen to sounds.  Presumably the matrix machine
didn't call off the fight with a sound wave, but with radio waves.</p>

<p>That cat with the gashed up face after the sentinels ate his lunch
was some pretty good costuming.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I like how they depicted a woman as a better driver than a man.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Trinity taking control of the French cat was sweet.  "I don't have
time for this shit."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Oh the super-slo-mo Neo punching Smith scene kicked.  The water
drops elongated was dumb but acceptable to get the point across.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Um, so yeah.  The movie ruled the Matrices.</p>

<p class=date>3:36am</p>

<p>I gotta go to bed.</p>

<p>(ps: the taxi cost 2900 yen to get home.  Shin paid me 3000 yen for
the lesson tonight)</p>

<p>Woke up LATE</p>

<p>I <em>lost my phone</em> while running between trains in
Musashi-Kosugi.  That was my contact between Carla (for whom I'm
working and who called me at 9:15 to make sure I was up (I wanted to
be up at latest by 8:45) and who I then called back as was WALKING to
the train station (cause I lost my bike key last night) and told her
I'm late) and Cory (who I called after I couldn't reach Carla at
first) who then emailed me Kawasaki Nova's number which was the last
thing I entered into my address book before I lost it.</p>

<p>I imagine I'll get it back, but right now I'm visualizing the
Hollywood-esque camera watching the phone receiving a call but no one
to answer it and the caller going, "what tha hell?"</p>

<p>Sigh.</p>

<p>Okay; next station is Kawasaki.  Time to run again.</p>

<p>ps: I made the train at Musashi Kosugi, which requires really fast
runnin'.</p>

<p>I got my phone back.</p>

<p>Took over 30 minutes at Musashi Kosugi, but I got it back and all
is intact.</p>

<p>I told the cat I lost my phone and he snagged a phone from the back
that looked a lot like mine but he said it wasn't mine.</p>

<p>I'm like, <em>how do you know?</em> but I could only think of the
word "nande" (why) but not the full query.</p>

<p>He got an English speaking cat on the phone who was repeating in
English the same things that the first guy told me in Japanese (call
this number on Monday) and then I was like, "aight that's all good yo,
but can you ask this cat how he knows the phone he showed me a second
ago (*) isn't my phone?"</p>

<p>(*) by second I meant 20 minutes</p>

<p>And he was all, "lemme talk to that mofo," and soon enough I heard
the guy on my end say "murasaki" (purple) so he had assumed that by
saying pink (in my obviously limited Japanese) I couldn't possibly
have meant this light lavender shade.  But then the cat on the other
end of the phone was like, "Oh check it yo, I'll call it an see if
that bitch rings an shit" and sure enough it did.</p>

<p>Got my phone back.</p>

<p>Just had my lesson with Shin.  Got fed, got paid.  Stanked like
smoke until I took off my two shirts (white undershirt and U2 concert
T) (using girl magic in the train station) and am now wearing only my
GAP hoodie.  Showin' a little bit of fur at the neckline.</p>

<p>At Miho's I put my hoodie and jacket in my backpack to hide them
from the smoke.</p>

<p><h1>smart socks</h1></p>

<p>I don't know if they've been invented yet, but left and right
chipped-socks could react positively when near their mates.</p>

<p>I wonder if they could squirm toward their mates in a pile of
laundry.  Nah, robots would be more efficient than motorizing socks.</p>

<br>If they have a bit of communication, then in the dryer socks can take turns <br>
being magnetized.  You might get all your socks stuck to your jeans zippers,<br>
but oh, well.<br>

<br>By Jove, you&rsquo;re right.  Absent sock-chipping technology, though, i&rsquo;m going to bleach &ldquo;1L&rdquo; and &ldquo;1R&rdquo; into the hem of one pair of socks with a de-cottoned Q-tip, &ldquo;2L&rdquo; and &ldquo;2R&rdquo; into the next pair, and so on, because my sock wardrobe is tangible proof of the principle of entropy.</p>

<p>When I got to the bike parking lot (after over an hour train ride),
I found that I didn't have my keys.</p>

<p>I used them to retrieve my bag from the locker at the park; maybe I
left my keys attached to the locker key.</p>

<p>The most troublesome thing: how will I ride my bike home from
Matrix in 24 hours if my bike is locked to the bike parking lot?</p>

<p>Tokyo Dome City features Thunder Dolphin, a coaster that climbs
quickly and silently, drops what feels like invertedly, then climbs a
building, goes through a hole in a wall that's a continuation of the
face of the building, through a ferris wheel, and then around the
course again, but a bit lower.</p>

<p>It features two pictures per car, merged into a bi-collage with the
edges fuzzed out in such a way that my camera was not visible in the
frame.</p>

<p>It's a pretty fly coaster.</p>

<p>We rode it twice in a row, the first time in the very front seat.
(In Japanese parks, this is luck of the draw, no one is allowed to
wait specifically for a particular seat.)  We got back in line
immediately and I was like "kite kite" (key-te) to the guys who had
ridden behind us, one of whom did not seem to have enjoyed the ride as
much as I did.  They succumbed to my peer pressure (though I'm
probably 10-15 years older) and on their second ride <em>they</em> got
to ride in the very front seat, while we were in the back middle
somewhere.</p>

<p>Because I encouraged them to ride, I waited for their ride to
finish to exchange laughs and limited language.  We didn't hang with
them any past that.  (But we did see them in the tunnel between two
parts of the park and I gave them all high fives, saying "money!" each
time.  (dammit why have I decided that's an okay term?))</p>

<p>* Rode the drop tower (not so tall)</p>

<p>* Rode the indoor coaster (lame-ish)</p>

<p>* Rode the suspended shuttling coaster (lame-ish)</p>

<p>* Rode the ferris wheel (good views of Thunder Dolphin)</p>

<p>* Rested for a bit at Starbucks</p>

<p>* Rode Thunder Dolphin again, and this time I remembered about the
second camera, but I thought it was on the left not the right.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Left the park, met a man who I think is Tomoko's boyfriend (he's a
bit older; it's common for young girls to have an older man boyfriend
in Japan), but she didn't come right out and say he was.</p>
