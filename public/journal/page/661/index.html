<b>STATE OF MY LIFE</b>
<p>
<ol>
<p><li>I have mostly recovered from losing my hard drive, and I am more careful to archive the documents I update regularly. However(!) my disply adapter is only running at 640x480 pixels and 16 colors!  I've tried everything I can think of and I can't get it to do more. Kinda hard to scan pics this way!</li>

<p><li>I had fun at gymnastics tonight - did roundoff back flips and got some that were pretty high compared to normal for me.  I bounced lots on the trampoline too.
<br>Oh and it was weird since I wore my glasses there; I can't tumble with them on, so I was essentially tumbling blind, or at least very blurry.  Kinda fun!</li>

<p><li>I quit my part time job today.  Now It's just me and MR Laboratories, my web design company!  I'm nervous and excited all at once! I opened my business bank account and have tons of tax forms and all kinds of craziness. Come on by <a href="https://www.mrlaboratories.com">www.mrlaboratories.com</a> to see my site there!</li>

<p><li>My dad gave me a clock that we've dubbed "the ball clock."  It has an arm that picks up a marble from the bottom and drops it into the top of the clock once per minute.  With a few simple weighted levers, the balls line up and keep track of time.

<p>This clock has been in our family for years..  Probably like 15 or 20 years.  It's been dormant at my dad's house for as many as 10 years; it's been with my brother for some years, and my brother gave it back to my dad, and my dad gave it to me.

<p>Yay!! I enjoyed watching the clock do its thing for a few weeks.

<p>Yesterday I ripped out the assembly of troughs that guide the marbles to their appropriate levers, which I left intact. My goal is to rebuild the troughs with popsicle sticks!

<p>Really.  Don't laugh!  I can do this, and maybe I'll get pics of it on here (I've been promising a lot of pics on my site lately, haven't I?)</li>

<p><li>Over the weekend I had a Beastie Boys marathon, listening to all their albums over and over, especially _Hello Nasty_, which I really enjoy.</li>

<p><li>Spot, my cat of two years, has been more talkative lately.  He still jumps out the second story window to a branch to go outside, and comes back the same way. I just thought I'd mention him.</li>

<p><li>Starting the second weekend of October, I'll be busy for 6 weekends in a row. Wow..  That includes driving to San Antonio, Lake Texoma (on the border of Texas and Oklahoma, hence the name), and a drive to and from Tulsa.  Crazy!</li>

</ol>

<li>It's currently 3:06am.  Why am I up so late?</li>
<li>I just uploaded two pages to my new domain <a href="https://www.mrlaboratories.com">www.MRLaboratories.com</a>! This site is for my webpage design business!</li>
<li>Spot, my cat, is curled up so very cutely in a small box beside me.. If I just had a camera!</li>
<li>Speakin' of cameras, I got a lotta pictures from when Houston flooded this past weekend!  I still intend to get some scanned and onto my site.</li>
<li>Oh yeah-- I have just recovered web access and stuff after my machine was down all last week.  I lost a 2.5 gig hard drive and <em>all</em> my email before like 9 September or so. Sigh.</li>
<li>Yipes! I haven't sent out a Feel Good Net in a while!</li>
<li>I'm going to Costa Rica in November!  I think I'm leaving on 18 November (Tammy's birthday) and coming back on 26 November. I'll be meeting my friend Kathryn (from California) there. I am totally excited about this trip!</li>

<p class=date>22:16 Friday 11 September 1998</p>

<p>The plan was that today at 5am Bryan would arrive at my house from Oklahoma City and I would drive him to Intercontinental Airport so he could fly off to Newark at 7am.

<p>Fair enough except that it was raining super hard all night.  Bryan called me at 5:15am.  He said he thought he passed the exit to get to my house, and so I told him to turn around and try to find it again.  Soon as I hung up the phone I realized my mistake.  He had <i>not</i> passed the exit yet, and in fact was only barely close.

<p>"Awman... and now he's going the wrong direction looking for me"  My brain kinda freaked out for a second and I realized there was really nothin' I could do (since the caller ID said "UNAVAILABLE" for the number and he had been at a pay phone anyway..  Hmmm.)

<P>So I put my CD player on repeat: Beastie Boys' "Paul Revere" from their <i>Licensed to Ill</i> album.  Why?  Because the last time I saw Bryan was last weekend in Tulsa, and we recited that song verbatim before one of our meetings.  I chilled and meditated, "Bryan call me back. Bryan call me back."

<p>It worked, or not, and he called me back and I gave him my car phone number and instead of him coming to my place, zipped up there and he headed back toward the airport and I told him to find a hotel and call me.  I woulda told him to simply go to the airport, but he was nervous doing that..  It is a big airport..

<p>So I zip off to get him and woah-- Allen Parkway is flooded.  So I zip off to the next closest place to go north on I-45.  Also flooded.   D'oh!

<p>So I zip off to the next closest place, which was fully a couple miles away and finally got on the freeway.

<p>Way late and the traffic was bad but not terrible and only in a couple of places was the freeway waterlogged down to 1 lane passing through..  I sped along at about 50mph, fully 10 mph faster than traffic was flowing.

<p>Got to the hotel where Bryan was waiting outside and zipped off to the airport, tossed him out at ticketing and I parked and ran inside and bing.. there's Bryan in line. He had missed his flight and was in line to get reseated on a different flight.

<p>The next flight was at 8:02am, only 1 hour after the first, so we casually walked to the gate and everything was all good.

<p>Then I had to go home.

<p>This time I was headed toward downtown Houston, in rush hour traffic, with a tropical storm bucketing water on us.  All the news reports were saying, "don't go downtown."  "Go home."  "All these school districts are closed."  "Forget it."  But especially "Don't go downtown."

<p>But I *live* downtown!!  Where are all these other people going?????

<p>I saw a whole ton of brake lights since I-45 was apparently closed inside the 610 loop, so I took the loop to Shepherd and actually made it home pretty quickly.

<p>9am I got home.  Called in to work.  No way am I coming in; I want to play!!!!

<p>Eric called.  So I took the opportunity to invite him to go play out in the rain with me.  He accepted and we went.

<p><hr width="50%" align="left">

<p>We walked from my house to Allen Parkway, which apparently had been closed due to flooding.  I figured the water would be a few or maybe in 5 feet deep in the underpasses.

<p>Holy cow was I wrong!  The water was a few feet *over* the overpass!

<p>Now wait... before I get you all confused:  Allen Parkway dips down about 25 feet to go under the "ground level" roads.  "Ground level" in this case means the level of the top of the banks of Buffalo Bayou, a small river thing that usually is 20+ feet below its banks.  Not today.

<p>Today, Buffalo Bayou had escaped.  The water had totally crested its banks and poured over the land and filled the underpass of Allen Parkway.  Amazing.  I had never seen it so deep in the 9 years that I've lived here.

<p>Nothing for Eric and I to do but go for a walk!  We stayed on the ground level roads, though I was tempted to swim in the 25 feet deep water over Allen Parkway..  My higher self suggested that I don't do that.  But we walked.

<p>Walked and waded and splashed and had a great time, marveling at air bubbles coming up through the groove between the sidewalk and street, marveling at the swarms of insects using the rail as a haven, marveling at the cars stranded with water over their hoods, but most of all, marveling at all the water!!!!

<p>"We gotta have a camera!"

<p>We walked a bit further and saw a sign that we *had* to photograph.  

<pre>
            FLOOD
            GAUGE
</pre>

it said.  The sign was only about 1 foot above the water. We laffed our butts off to see that!  Oh yes, we *must* have a picture of this.

<p>Then we got yelled at from a guy on the shore.

<p>"HEY YOU TWO IN THE WATER!!  YOU DUMB <B>ASSESS</B>!  GET OUT OF THE WATER! THERE ARE GIANT PUMPS DOWN THERE THAT WILL SUCK YOU UNDER!!!

<p>Eric said, "okay!"

<p>I said nothing but thought thankfully to myself that I wouldn't get sucked under because it's not my time to die yet. Thank you angels.

<p>I joked, "we coulda told him, 'oh yeah? come get us!'"  "Or walked over toward him and be all, 'what?' and then pretend to trip and drown."  We didn't do any of these, but we did go back to get a camera.

<p>Actually we just got film for Eric's camera and drove back closer to the intersection.  

<p>It was deeper this time.  Not by much, but the water had clearly risen a few inches in the 30-45 minutes we took to get back.  Wow.

<p>We got the pics, laughed and had a great time. They turned out beautifully.  We got them developed at Walgreen's today and I will soon get some on my site so you can see!!

<p class=date>21:31 Friday 11 September 1998</p>

<p>Today started last night for me.  Manda came over and we talked and chilled and she had brought some Japanese crab burritos or something like that:  Crab, celery, rice, all rolled into a burrito shape with seaweed as the wrapper.  Good stuff.  She ate them mostly with soy sauce, I ate them mostly plain.

<p>Then she showed me the green stuff that came with the meal.  Looks kinda like play-doh.  A bit squishier.. maybe like hummus.

<p>But play-doh is salty, and hummus tastes a bit tangy.  This green stuff was hot.

<p>Oh yes! I recognized Lucian had a tube of this at Con Con!  Like a toothpaste tube, but I wouldn't try brushing my teeth with it. I took a splot of it on my finger.

<p>"This is for Lucian," and smeared it fully onto my tongue and squished it around my mouth <i>ohmygod</i>.  I closed my eyes and zoned on the sensation.  

<p>Tears poured out my eyes. If I breathed wrong, the vapor sizzled my nose... WOW.  To a dull burning the feeling chilled and then began to subside.  I squished the saliva around my mouth and swallowed it all down.

<p>Yeah.

<p>Manda was wide eyed like, "wow."

<p>We finished the burrito things (what <i>are</i> they called?) and at the end the green goop was left.  I smooshed it around with the chopsticks and tasted the hot residue on the sticks.  Hmm.  Again?

<p>Some twisted part of me said "yes" even though Manda was all, "'stotally up to you."  I got a bigger blob than Lucian had done at Con Con. I pondered it..  It only took 10 minutes last time; this couldn't take more than 15.  Smeared it on my tongue and onto the roof of my mouth.

<p><i>sizzle</i> went my tongue.  <i>ha ha</i> went the green stuff.  <i>eeep</i> went the burning sensation through my nose.
My eyes cried and I meditated on the whole process again.  mmmmm

<p>damn that was hot. Even now as I type, 24 hours later, I can still feel my tongue is raw.  Crazy stuff.  Try it!

<p>But what happened all day today?  Houston flooded.  That's what I originally intended to write about.  See the next entry.

<p class=date>Thursday 10 September 1998</p>

<p>Yes, I haven't written in a while.  Sigh..  Sometimes I feel so
bogged down and I have so much fun stuff to write!!  Tulsa Rally was
last weekend, dinner at Niko Niko's was last night, and I've had lots
of anti-fun with my scanner not working!

<p>But I'm here on campus at UH again; just ate lunch and said HI to Nikki and Sara and am about to go to Scholars' Community where I used to work on campus.    .. ..  I wonder if Tina is still workin' there.  I assume so.  :-)  Yay!

<p>I just had a theological conversation with Nikki, and the following questions came to my mind:

<p><ul>
<li>What do you think happens after we die?</li>
<li>What is sin?</li>
<li>Do you believe in heaven?</li>
<li>Is God male or female or neither?</li>
<li>Does God ever become angry?</li>
<li></li>
<li>What is the most important thing in life?</li>
<li>What are emotions?</li>
<li>Is there life on other planets?</li>
<li>Do mosquitoes have souls?</li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe I'll address these in my Gravity section.  mail me your answers!

<p>Tonight when I got home from I-group, I noticed the tree at the corner of the parking lot had, um.. let's say, done an impression of the Leaning Tower of Pisa.  Its branches were brushing the ground, making a virtual jungle where I normally park Scott.

<p>So I parked Scottie on the street and checked out the situation. 

<p>Turns out the power lines were holding the tree up from falling all the way over. The very short shallow roots had just lifted right out of the ground on one side and that was it!

<p>I greatly thank my angels for such an easy tree removal process.  No cars were crunched, the apartment building was not smushed, and the only thing that had to be repaired was my phone line.

<p>The parking lot is pretty small, so even the staircase in the back of the building was a virtual jungle of branches.  I climbed up the steps like an old Aztec pyramid in the jungle.

<p>I called my landlord who called the light company and they came out at 11pm.  They looked at the tree. "This is too big for us; we'll have to call a tree crew."

<p><pre>(The "Tree Crew" ?  I've never heard of them.)</pre>

<p>I went to bed, and gave thanks in advance for waking up gently as soon as the crew got here.  I wanted to take pictures!

<p>I woke up, didn't hear anything, so went back to sleep and then "whoah!" I heard chain saws!  So I grabbed my camera and zipped outside, down through the jungle and took pictures.

<p>I actually went crazy and took an entire roll; we'll see how they turn out, and I expect to scan them onto my site soon.</p>

                        <p><title>experiencing University of Houston</title></p>

<p class=date>25 August 1998</p>

<p>Yesterday my friend Sarah invited me to say HI to her at 4pm at Camp Guerin at University of Houston.

<p>I was almost embarassed that I had to ask, "which one is Camp Guerin?"  (She told me it's the one by PGH.)  "Oh yeah!"

<p>So today I took a nap and perfectly woke up at 3:40 and drove out to UH. Wow. Nostalgic feelings rushed toward me at 60 miles per hour on the highway.

<p>Oh my gosh they're building a highway right in front of the main entrance!!  Wow! I won't have to wait for this traffic light anymore... but it sure will feel different.

<p>I rolled around to the back side of the campus where I always parked and found a spot fairly close.

<p>Barefoot, with frisbee in hand, I stepped back onto my campus.

<p>Light smile of the Buddah on my face as all the memories flood back from the residence halls... Walking through the Quad, where I nearly lived for 3 years (I never actually lived there, but I hung out there all the time) everything seemed the same.. except they had powerwashed the buildings!  They seemed white!  Wow!

<p>Over the bridge across my fountain and toward PGH I saw Sarah sitting by Camp Guerin, reading. I pretty much was right by her before she saw me.

<p>"HI!"

<p>"HI!"

<p>We hugged and walked over to the University Center for a snack. Before we got there, we stopped by a booth labeled, "First Impressions."  To my wonderous surprise, I was recognized.

<p>His name is Eric, and he knew me as that Barefoot Frisbee Guy on campus. Wow! I introduced myself and Sarah. He said he would probably be there for another hour so we might catch him on the way back from the UC. Cool.

<p>In front of the UC, I recognized someone.

<p>"ohmygosh" I said. "I know him I know him..."   "HI!"

<p>His name is Mike.

<p>"Oh yeah!" We said HI a bit and I introduced Sarah. Short conversation as we never *really* knew each other, but yeah.

<p>Sarah and I bought snacks (I got trail mix, ice cream bar, and Surge) and walked down to the lounge by Campus Activities, where people had filled more than half the chairs, talking, studying, and one girl was even curled up sleeping.. Normal college stuff.

<p>I told Sarah stories and delighted in the delight of just being *back* at UH again.. so much was still the same.

<p><blockquote>'course, it's only been 2.5 years; not that much could change.. but it seems like it's been forever!!</blockquote>

<p>Into Campus Activities we wandered and I was drawn to the office of the Student Program Board.  Her desk was moved, but LaDonna's name was still on the plaque.  yay!

<p>I said HI to someone named April, and left a fun note for LaDonna.

<p>Then outside we meandered to go to AH.

<p>Just outside the UC, I saw Spencer!! I couldn't remember his name but I knew it started with an S. He just almost remembered mine. Amazing! I gave him my email address and stuff. It'll be cool if he emails me.

<p>Back over to say HI to Eric, we said HI and he asked about my degree and job and I told him and told him I quit to do youth advising..  We just yacked a bit and I wished him a great semester.

<p>(I'll speed this story up)

<p>To Social Work (building) to AH organization office I met Nicky (sp) a friend of Sarah's, and lo and behold she knew that *I* was the Wonderboy who busted his head inline skating!

<p>I gave her the <a href="/skate/skate06.html">URL</a> of the adventure so she can read about it. Yay! I love it when people are interested in my page!

<p>Walked Sarah to her class in the Roy Cullen building right next to the big fountain.  I cut the corner and waded through the fountain, just to do it.

<p>"I knew you were going to do that."

<p>"How?" I teased.

<p>"I just did!"

<p>Hugged her off to her class and walked back out to my fountain and sat, meditating in the comforting energy.

<p>Met and talked to Susan and Eddie, who were staffing a "First Impressions" table just like Eric had been, and told them all sorts of stories of some of my adventures on campus, mostly centered around the airvents.

<p><blockquote>"See, the airvents are all evacuating air out of the tunnels under the campus. My friend, who shall remain nameless, and I decided to map out the vents from underground. So, of course, we had to name them first.

<p>"We started over by the shallow wading fountain, and called that one 'AV Omega'  (AV stands for Air Vent)

<p>"Then there's the flat air vent over there that we call 'AV Bacteria.' That's because it's by the Ezekiel Cullen Building or 'E Cullen' or 'E Coli'.. bacteria!

<p>"Then we named that one after Marcel (oops I said his name), 'Camp Guerin'

<p>"The one over by Social work is 'Nugen's landing,' named after me, and then there's 'Lonesome Squirrel' over by the SR1 building."</blockquote>

<p>I continued my stories of all the air vent names I could remember (pretty much all of them (unless I forgot any hahaha)) and I could see after a while they were getting bored of my stories.

<p>That was cool because a guy named Joe walked up and asked where the Engineering building was.

<p>"I'll walk you to it," I said, and I did.

<p>I mosied (how do one spell the past tense of mosey?) over to the Communications building and found the Daily Cougar office and the Houstonian (yearbook) offices both closed.

<p>Then back toward my fountain, where I found Nicky again!  Wow!

<p>And here's the coolest part of the day: she was taking pictures of the water spouts in the fountain, and I waded out there and posed for the shots! (Anything for a publicity stunt!)

<p>I met her friends and we yacked a bit and then it was time to mosey some more.

<p>I wished them all great semesters and headed off west into the sunset toward gymnastics, with incredible joy, high energy love and happiness for the world.

<p>Awwwww.</p>

                        <p><title>Hey that&rsquo;s my name</title></p>

<p class=date>18 August 1998</p>

<p>I got home from gymnastics and had a voice message from Bridge! I haven't seen her in like 6 years, and I was surprised to hear her area code is 281. That's near me! (Last I heard she was in Virginia)

<p>But here's the weird part: I called her back and her son Robert answered. Nothing too strange about that, (except that he's 9 now instead of 3) but when I told him my name he's all "that's my name!"

<p>I feigned surprise. "Really?"

<p>Back in the day, I was one of Bridge's best friends and she named her first son after me. Wow.  And it just really hit home when he was all, "that's my name!" ... and I'm thinkin' "I know!"

<p>So I'm talkin' to Bridge now and she's surfin' my site for the first time and I'll let her get a sneak preview of this page.

<h1>STATE OF MY LIFE</h1>

<p><ol>
<p><li>I am pissed right now at Windows 98 because my web browsers keep locking up and stuff.</li></p>

<p><li>I've been feeling overall crappy in my life; I feel unproductive even though I'm doing stuff all the time. I'm doing youth work, organizing projects, encouraging participation, pulling staples, attending conferences and dinners...</li>

<p><li>but my apartment is a wreck and sometimes I think "I shouldn't have broken up with Wende" cause she obviously did a lot more work on the apartment than I ever recognized. Or maybe it's just been because I've been out of town for essentially 3 weeks of the past month.</li>

<p><li>I haven't gotten my ConCon journal entries transcribed yet. They are all written in my diary, but not here on my webpage.</li>

<p><li>I got 10 rolls of film developed from the week of ConCon. Fabulous pictures in several cases and I may scan them and get them on here.</li>

<p><li>I'm getting a few hits per day; I thank you all for visiting and/or returning as the case may be!</li>

<p><li>I have to zip off to the Lodge now for work.</li>

<p><font size =-1>3:30pm</font>

<p><li>after work I'm feelin' better, and have scheduled a chat with my friend Char (pronounced "shar"), who I see infrequently.  Each time we talk, she offers fabulous insightful thoughts that have always helped me become clear about my life.</li>

</ol>

<p class=date>11:30am Tuesday 4 August 1998</p>

<p><br><font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font></p>

<p>Woke up and read part of <em>Shield</em> and talked to Torger and Galen and others on staff out on our cabin porch. Then breakfast and sat at the same table with mostly the same group as dinner last night. We talked and chilled a bit and bounced a plastic ring from a coke bottle plastic cap.

<p>At the Spirt Circle I sat between Carol and Jeremy who sang "Greasy Grimey Gopher Guts" for everyone.  Well he started it but didn't remember quite all the lyrics..

<p>I made an announcement encouraging people to write in what we in the Southwest District call the "Big Gray Rally Book," a YRUU diary that is actually volume II. I started volume 1 back in July 1996 at the New Orleans Rally.

<p>Then someone (I think Allison or maybe Mimi) led the "Happy Boy" song, which I didn't know, but many people did and sang along with it.  Something about a dead dog and his guts in a jar.

<p>During the Growth Stages workshop, we did a bonding game and had a ten minute nap, during which I actually fell asleep!  Nice.
Then we shared stories about our first memories before 5 years old.
