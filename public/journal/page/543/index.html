<p class=dream>Leaving a rally; it was Plano Rally,
and also my first Rally since I'm not on YAC.  As I
thought back over the weekend, I thought I had done a
lot of rally stuff, but I couldn't remember any of it.
 Oh my god what had I done?  Didn't I meet any of
these new faces?  Everyone was leaving and I didn't
know anyone; I had an extra 5 hours at this rally
because there was no YAC meeting.. but what had I
done?</p>

<p class=dream>I asked Joana for a mugbook so I could
catch up and learn all the names that way, but she
said it was late and wouldn't be here until 1pm.  I
was all, okay, and thought "hey I didn't even write
you a single letter since the last rally!"</p>

<p class=dream>I went out to my car and was just
<em>so</em> sad that I had been at this rally and
<em>missed</em> it, because I had apparently been
alone the whole time; I couldn't remember having done
anything with the group.  Crying crying crying so sad,
and then</p>

<p>I woke up.. so relieved and so thankful it was all
a dream!</p>

<p>I won 50 cents in the lottery!</p>

<p>More precisely, I won the bet against Minh that I
would win the java applet lottery before he would.</p>

<p>From this <a
href="https://www.cadenhead.org/book/java2411/lottomad.shtml">page</a>:</p>

<p>He gave me a quarter because I won first, and
another quarter because I kept both my java applet
windows open longer than he did.</p>

<p>I'm tired.</p>

<p>Wonderfully tired and my quads are a bit sore after
riding my new bike!  I rode from the bike shop to
Dude's house, then to the bookstore to get my Japanese
workbook, and then to work to drop off my bike in my
car and drive home.  So tired.  I don't really have a
way to guaged how far I went - something like 10 or 12
miles I'm guessing.</p>

<p>Time for B-E-D bed.</p>

<p>Hardly a productive programming day today, but I
did some research on lodging in Austin for 12-15 June
for a SAS training thing.  I found a place that
overlooks Lake Travis for only $139 per night. 
Awesome!</p>

<p>That's not where I'm staying though.  ;-)  I'm
thinking more like Motel 6 or something.</p>

<p>Got a little bit done with appDev Studio; with
Kevin's help, I'm 1 step further than I was on
Friday.</p>

<p>Now Wende and I are about to go get new bikes!  We
have wanted bicycles for a super long time.</p>

<p class=dream>Planning for wedding stuff, I took a
wagon (radio flyer) down the hill and up the next hill
to the local baking supply sales place that was run
out of this lady's house.  I arrived and her son was
half way yelling at the eagles/big birds and halfway
just doing his job taking care of them.  His attitude
turned me off and I decide  not to shop there,
especially when his father came out and was all say "I
Love you" and the son did, and the father was all,
"oh, good pronounciation" in a spiteful hateful way.  
I defiitely didn't want to shop there anymore.</p>

<p class=dream>On the way back, I put my cat Spot in
the wagon, and he stayed there, cuddled up in the nest
of rags as I rode the wagon speeding down the hill. 
So so much fun!  I was quite thankful that Spot was
willing to ride down the hill with me.  At the bottom,
people were all commenting how cute it was.</p>

<p class=dream>Then Erika (Karla's daughter) was in a
kayak race and I sat down on her kayak just before she
was ready to race.  She was all like, "I don't know if
I can race because <em>someone</em> won't get off the
kayak."</p>

2001</p>

<p>Just got back home from hanging out with Dude and
Veronica.  Dude and I played disc golf at UH.  We
looked for the disc that was lost in the bushes when
Maggie, Molly, John, Will, Wende and I all played some
weeks ago.  Did not find it.</p>

<p>We played the old-school time honored course, all
the way to AV Incognito, Canyon Breeze, Sand Creek,
and  Collegium.  We stopped by AH Auditoriums for
water for the pooches, and (!) I climbed to the top of
Auditorium 2 by "chimneying" between two wall things. 
Dude said it was a very common rock climbing
technique.  It worked for me all the way to the top! 
I tossed some large branches off the top of the
building (they had apparently broken during the recent
storm.. just doing some cleanup work for my old alma
matter.</p>

<p>It took me a bit longer to figure out how to get
down; I ended up (down) jumping into the flower bed
which is against the auditorium restrooms, facing
Social Work building.</p>

<p>We went quickly through the rest of the course and
guess what?  The grounds are being planted all around
the rock water fountain and Taub and the Chapel,
including on top of the hill for the tee-off for the
17th hole!  Bunch of flowers and shit!  What are they
thinking??</p>

<p>- - -</p>

<p>After UH we picked up Veronica from their house and
munched lunch at Jason's Deli, where Jorge was the
cashier!  Wende and I know Jorge from our millions of
trips to Taco Bell.  Cool to see him there!</p>

<p>Back to their crib, we watched The Mummy (1999) and
declared the special effects good, but rated the movie
about a 50%.  Good special effects though.</p>

<p>Dude just dropped me off and Wende just got home
and Sally just called and will come over in a bit so
we can go munch at La Jaliscience!</p>

<p>Sally and I walked to La Jaliscience, and found my
shoes carefully placed by the door by Wende who had
driven ahead.  Sally took a picture of them.</p>

<p>Lotsa chips and big burritos and enchiladas and
lots of happy talking and <a
href="https://freeweb.pdq.net/ajamail/">Angélique</a>
said HI as I walked by her table!  She was there with
her husband Aaron, who I kinda knew from UH.</p>

<p>Shared Latest Adventure stories and Upcoming Plans
with Sally, and lots of just general fun talkin'.</p>

<p>After La Jaliscience, back to our casa where Sally
gave us a CD of her drumming group (from back before
she was part of the group) and we danced happy bouncy
shakey dancing to drumming drumming drumming.  Even
pounded beats out on the drum given to Wende and me by
Jon W-L and wore little shaker anklets and had a
absolutely great time!</p>

<p>Super excited that I *think* I properly remembered
the Brazilian Foot Dance as taught to me by Bryn in
Melbourne.  Sally and I were able to get the rhythm
down pretty well after not too much practice.  I'm
pretty sure I remember the steps correctly; I really
hope I did!</p>

<p>Wende took a couple of posed foot dance pictures
before we moved the night to its denouement.</p>

<p>When we walked outside together after such happy
bouncy drumming and dancing, Sally blessed my being,
my soul, our friendship.  Sally is so great!</p>

<p>I called this entry anything because it's the first
and last one of the day, so I don't have to worry
about making a name that will fit in alphabetical as
well as chronological order; I can call it anything I
want.</p>

<p>YRUU was fun; I attended the RE portion, which was
a party for the seniors (Katy and John (though John
wasn't there)) and a brief discussion of what
discussions might be discussed next semester.</p>

<p>Cassie's fabulous cousins Kelly (sp) and Laura (sp)
attended as well; they are in from North Carolina,
where it's about 60 degrees these days.</p>

<p>We all visited the mall for lunch afterward; we
made an semi-circle of tables in the food court as our
base while people munched or talked.  Oh- they have a
set of terminals there offering free internet access,
except they were "not working," according to the kid
working (reading) there.  "Are you still getting
paid?"  I inquired.  "Yes."</p>

<p>"I want that job!" came the general consensus from
those who heard the discussion.</p>

<p>Thanks to Nick and Susie who hung around until I
finished my vegetarian greek filafel (sp); we walked a
single circuit around the mall together before it was
time to go.</p>

<p>Played games in YRUU: Captain Video, and
Pict-O-Gram.  Captain Video is defined online
somewhere I'm sure.  It's a visual version of the game
telephone where people whisper a sentence to the next
person who whispers it to the next person, and the
sentence transmogriphies its way around the
circle.</p>

<p>Pict-O-Gram started with Bryn and I (I think!!) at
OKC last year.  Each person write a sentence at the
top of their own sheet of paper.  Give it to the next
person who draws a picture or "hieroglyphic" version
of the sentence.  Fold the paper so the original
sentence cannot be seen and give it to the next
person.  This person writes a sentence translating the
picture(s).  On and on until the paper is filled up. 
Ending with a sentence is funnier (in my opinion)
because we can read the first sentence, and the final
sentence for a good laugh!</p>

<p>Meg is archiving the pages in our YRUU
scrapbook.</p>

<p>Then to home where I munched a bowl of cereal and
then to the bicycle shop in the village where I test
rode the bike "KONA."  I like it.  I'll buy it on
Tuesday after work with Wende when she can buy a bike
as well.  Then we'll go ride around town on our fly
new rides!</p>

<p>Then I visited Jennifer at Paint This!, where I
painted a little dry erase board thing that Wende
thought was quite cute when we were there this
weekend.  Jennifer sat ate her bagel-lunch at my table
as I painted.  This dry erase message board is so
cute!!</p>

<p>I'll be able to pick it up next Sunday.</p>

<p>Then home and my dad and Karen came over and we met
Wende at Chuy's for our monthly dinner.  Lovely meal
and hugs and I borrowed the two latest issues of
Discover magazine to read.</p>

<p>Got home and Sally had called!  She is in town and
we may get to play tomorrow!!!  I'm going to play disc
golf with Dude in the morning; maybe Sally will join
us for that.  (I'm guessing not, though; she is a
pretty late-night type person)</p>

<p>I'll let you know tomorrow!</p>

<p>Wende and I hung out pretty much all day today. 
Went to Mission Burritos, where our next door
neighbors Bob and Jennifer met us for breakfast. 
Quite yummy.  Then Wende and I went to look at
bicycles at a Scwhinn shop in the village.  Said HI to
Jennifer at Paint This! and then went to KTRU where I
turned in a swill CD and checked out two new ones for
review.</p>

<p>Then we went to Sun City Skate Park, where Wende
bought a new skating helmet, and I bought new Pro
Design wrist guards.  They are excellent; I will have
them for a long ass time.  Then to Montrose Skate Shop
to buy new wheels for my skates.  I have worn my
current wheels down pretty evenly, but have a big
chunk taken out of one of the wheels.  It's like a C
now basically.  I didn't put the new wheels on; just
rotated the old ones so the C is in the middle instead
of on the ends.  I should get pretty much a lot more
mileage out of them.</p>

<p>Oh!  Also from the Montrose Skate Shop, I got two
awesome excellent great customer service things:  1)
John fixed a broken rivet on my skates (at no charge)!
and 2) he gave me a sheet of waterproof foam stuff to
replace the water-(stinky sweat)-logged foam in my
helmet.  The main padding is still there; I just used
his small padding to replace the crappy padding; it
was just foam rubber.  This new stuff is a lot better.
 And he just gave it to me!  The Montrose Skate Shop
is great!</p>

<p>Then it RAINED huge huge huge rain and some hail
and a lot of lightning and thunder.  It's not the
<em><b>-*! H U G E S T !*-</b></em> rain I've ever
seen since we've lived here, but it was pretty
thorough.  We lost power for a bit (I *love* my <a
href="https://www.apcc.com">APC</a> UPS!), and took
several power spikes.</p>

<p>!Oh!  That reminds me...  (how to describe this?) 
As water was pouring out our waterspout from our roof,
I decided to collect it so we could water plants with
rain water instead of chlorine water.  I got a big
tray thing (actually an old (cleaned) cat litter box)
and put it next to the spout.  I cupped my hands at
the bottom of the spout, so the water wouldn't come
out unless it poured over my hands.  I could *almost*
get it into the box, but not quite.</p>

<p>Then, <em>lightning</em> nearby, and I could *feel*
a very slight shock from the water spout!  Yikes!!!!! 
I kinda freaked at that, but not so much that I quit
my project.</p>

<p>I found a little plexiglass thing that I set up as
a ramp from the bottom of the spout to over the edge
of the box, so when the rain really poured, the water
gushed out quickly enough that it ran up the ramp and
quickly filled the box!</p>

<p>Success!!</p>

<p>I collected about 7 gallons of water this way!</p>

<p>I've also been writing perl code to interface with
livejournal.com servers; I think I will be able to
'merge' my journal here with my journal there.</p>

<p>For some reason, Spot occassionally thinks it's a
good idea to MEOW repeatedly outside our bedroom door
while we are sleeping.</p>

<p>He woke me from a dream, and I tried to ignore him
and go back to sleep, but he persisted until I got up
and took his ass (and the rest of him) downstairs to
the dungeon (guest bedroom).  Peter was chillin' there
already; I don't know about Tinkerbell.</p>

<p>That was 30+ minutes ago.</p>

<p>I sat down and have been reading email, and reading
the answers posted to users' <a
href="https://www.livejournal.com/support/help.bml">questions</a>
at livejournal.com.  Still no answer to <a
href="https://www.livejournal.com/support/see_request.bml?id=5247">my
question</a>.</p>

<p>During this time, I watched far away lightning
creep closer and turn into a smattering of rain on the
window.  No huge storm though.  Maybe it will
grow.</p>
