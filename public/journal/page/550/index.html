<p>Work wasn't *totally* bluh today, but I didn't seem
to accomplish as much as I had hoped.  Got kinda stuck
on making sure I don't cause any errors online, and in
the morning I kept getting interrupt(MOO!)ed by
various dumb things.</p>

<p>Not totally dumb, but shit that wasn't in the same
wavelength as the code I was sorting through.</p>

<p>I have a concern that when I get in on Monday, I'm
going to have forgotten what the heck I was working
on, *and* I'll be deluged with BS little crappy stupid
things and then it will be forever before the shit
gets moved online.  So, I'm thinking of coming in this
weekend.</p>

<p>But That fucking SUCKS!!  I don't want to come in
this weekend.  I just want to do the right thing for
work and for myself.  Saturday is the one day off per
week that Wende and I both have.  And this week I am
not at KTRU.  Sunday Wende works, and I go to YRUU.  I
might come in to work early on Sunday.  Am I a
work-a-holic?  I don't think so.  I hope not. 
eww.</p>

<p>To help combat some of the above, I wrote a message
to myself so I can remember what my brain was
thinking.  I'll include it here just for computer nerd
posterity.</p>

<p>Jason and I are going to the Astros game tonight. 
I'm definitely looking forward to hanging out with
him.  We both pretty much don't give a shit about the
game, but it will be totally fun just to play around
with Jason.</p>

<p><img src="/images/rob/wL-ROB.gif"/></p>

<p>Here's the message I referred to:</p>

<pre>
WAZZAP.TXT

The basic idea is to move the new G3 stuff online.

Need to first determine where all the correct source
code should be stored.

I think the G3 should have its own directory, and it
might just need to be combined with OG 
(because the G3 uses OG_display_survey macro, and how
do I know when to update that macro?)

Then OS variants of G3 should have their own directory
for source code and data files.

Hunter already has its own directory; it just doesn't
have source code; it only has data 
files.

- - -

I just made content_printer print the indexes in the
dataset.

The idea is that I can copy all the data files from
online and compare them to the 
development data files on my machine.  Need to make
sure that if I have added variables, 
they get added online.

Need to make sure if I added observations, they get
added online.  I think the easy way to 
do this will be by sorting the
hunter_macros-equivalent datasets by the first two
columns.

- - -

Once I'm sure the datasets are all set, and I know
which is the source code to be moved 
online, then compile everything and move it online.

Yay!

<p class=date>11:38pm CDT Friday 27 April 2001</p></p>

<p>Baseball with Jason was pretty great fun tonight.  We chose this
night because the free promotion was coffee mugs, which we are more
likely to find useful than tomorrow night's promotion, ball caps.
Seated on the 6th row from the field, just behind third base, we
pretty much had a great view.  Super thanks to Jason's friend Ryan for
getting us the tickets.</p>

<p>Funny things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The owner of the company that gave out the coffee mugs threw
the first pitch.  I was all, "man - that must be harrowing for him.
He's just some guy who paid a million dollars to get his company's
name everywhere and now he gets to throw the first pitch.  I'd be all,
'okay, don't mess up don't mess up'..."</p>

<p>"Yeah, he throws it into the dirt, 'um, I meant to do
that.'"</p></li>

<li><p>We have one of the players sign the coffee mug, and then smash
it on the ground.</p></li>

<li><p>The two women behind us talktalktalktalking incessantly about
stupid stuff.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There was more funny stuff I'm sure, but I'm too tired to
remember.</p>

<p>Ryan came down to sit with us at about the 4th inning.  We left at
the end of the 7th inning while the Astros were ahead 8 to 6.  Someone
on the Astros hit a grand slam.  That was pretty cool to see.</p>

<p>Jason, Ryan and I went to Mai's vietnamese restaurant and laughed
and munched salted fried tofu.  Most excellent vegetarian munchies.  I
took 1/2 of mine home.</p>

<p>Ryan dropped us off at Jason's car and Jason dropped me off at home
and now it's time for bed.</p>

<p>Counseling session this morning brought interesting
concepts into focus.  It used to be that when I would
plan my day, I'd just write down a bunch of tasks,
chores, Things To Do.  I never included "hang out with
Wende" or some variety like that.</p>

<p>Maybe, because my lists never included "hang out
with Wende," maybe that's why I wouldn't sit down and
make those lists.  I would prefer to just sit and
talk.  </p>

<p>I dunno though.  Wende and I have pretty limited
free time together anyway, so it's been hard to
schedule such moments with Wende.  Maybe we should
look at that.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I seem to judge myself by how I think other people
see me.  I want to always be perfect - to say, do,
act, the right way so that I'm doing what I think
people think I should be doing.  Sometimes.  Sometimes
I'm just me and everything is great.  But underlying
there is this need to be good for others so that I can
be good or worthy.  Something like that.</p>

<p>I'm not open to feedback on the above unless it's
like, "I know what you mean." because the words above
don't really capture what's in my head.</p>

<p>As my brother would say,
<br>Back to work.</p>

<p>I'm back at work, and have just solved a dumb coding problem.  This
particular survey had 79 questions in it.  I was asked to add 3 questions to
it last month.  No problem.</p.

<p>It was discovered yesterday that the responses to these questions were
sometimes being saved, but usually not.  Hmmmm.</p>

<p>Short version of the story is that for some dumb reason, when the user
clicked the [SAVE] button, the data was being saved in one place, but when
they clicked [FINISHED] it was being saved in a different place.  Trust me,
this is dumb.  In fact, what was actually happening, the [FINISHED] button
was saving the data in the 1 place and then *also* saving the data in the
other place.</p>

<p>I had told the 1 place to save the extra 3 questions, but I didn't even
know the other place to save data existed.  Since it was superfluous and
dumb, I took it out.  Problem solved.</p>

<p>I'm still at work; I've been reading Laura's and
Hillary's jouranl entries for the past 2 (two) two
hours.  Wow.  I enjoy their styles of writing.  Laura
uses periods to pause her thoughts.  like. this. and
she doesn't see how awesome she is! Hillary has been
writing totally fun /slash/ cute poems for all her
friends and reading Laura's journal.</p>

<p>Such voyeurs aren't we all?</p>

<p>This weekend in Los Angeles was totally wow.  I
will write about it in a second.  Actually I'll write
about it now.</p>

<p class=date>9:18pm</p>

<p>I didn't have to write as much as I thought; I had
already typed a significant amount in my Handspring
Visor. I have just added these entries to this
month:</p>

<p class=date>11pm Monday 23 April 2001</p>

<p>One cool thing they set up for us at SUGI was to close off the Aquarium
except only to SUGI peeps, and give munchies (I can't spell hor's derves) to
boot.</p>

<p>I waited around studying spanish at the convention center for Patrick to
get out of a meeting so we could go together.  When I got bored of studying,
I talked to a convention center hostess girl named Jennifer.</p>

<p>She has braces :-), but otherwise wasn't my type, but I can't really
figure out why. (*) Anyway, we talk talk talked about all the places we've
been and want to go.  She actually has pretty much not yet been a lot of
places, but she told me about all the cool spots in LA.  I found out from
Jennifer that the big big round building with whales painted on the side is
*not* the aquarium.  It's the LA Arena where their hockey team plays.
Hmmm.</p>

<p>When Patrick got out of the meeting, I ditched my bag with Jennifer, who
would be there until midnight and Patrick and I went to the aquarium.  It's
about 3 blocks away from the convention center.</p>

<p>I smiled my best and brightest cutest Rob smile to the girl at the gate,
but dammit - it didn't work.  She was all, "um, do you have shoes?"</p>

<p>I must admit I got mad, and I didn't handle it very well.  "um, no;
they're back at the hotel."</p>

<p>She pulled out her walkie talkie to "see if it was okay."</p>

<p>(Actually this is when messed up.)  "nononononono" I pleaded.</p>

<p>"Can someone come in without shoes on?"</p>

<p>Anyway, they said no, and I said no I would *not* go back and get my
shoes; I'm outta here, which pretty much meant I *couldn't* go back and get
my shoes even if I wanted to without eating my words and looking like a
dumbass.</p>

<p>Sigh.  no aquarium.</p>

<p>Patrick walked back with me, and for this I am quite thankful.  We got
back to the convention center and I told Jennifer the story.  She said the
aquarium was not *that* great, and it wasn't worth walking back.  We talked
a bit more and traded snail mail addresses; she collects postcards, so I'll
send her a good Texas postcard.</p>

<p>Patrick and I then walked the 8 or so blocks to our motel.</p>

<p>(*) yes, Wende and I are still engaged to be married, but I still have
"girlfriends" in my mind. They don't know they're my girlfriends, and it's a
lot easier on them when I break up with them after a while.  Wende knows
that though I have these temporary crushes, she is my one and only sweet
precious angel.</p>

<p>At  a outdoor cafe thing with Kevin, Kathy, AJ, and
Erin as our waitress.</p>

<p>I have an idea for a theme for a KTRU show: a
countdown.  Just play track 12, 11, 10, ... down to
track 1 on various CDs.</p>

<p class=note>(written on 25 April)</p>

<p>I now have officially been to Long Beach in Los
Angeles.  Pretty light sandy colored sand, but with
itty bitty gold fleck looking things!  Certainly they
were not actually gold, but it looked like someone had
sprinkled glitter over the whole beach.  So pretty as
they glistened sparkly while the waves washed
over.</p>

<p>The water was FREEEZING cold!!!</p>

<p>Two weird man-made (?) islands off the shore, with
weird, um.. structures? art? big monolithic blocks of
white and other colors I think.  Weird.</p>

<p>Lots of peeps on the beach laying out and playing
in the sand.  I got sand only on my hands and feet.  I
didn't bring swim trunks.  And only 1 pair of shorts.
How silly!!!!!</p>

<p>But, as I said, the water was freeezing.</p>

<p>We decided to rent one of those 4 person bicycle
things.  Basically two tandem bikes bolted together
like the size of a big golf cart:</p>

<p class=date>5:29 pm 22 April 2001</p>

<p>I'm holding my keybard and Visor with my left hand
and typing a two or three finger type with my right
hand as we ride a tandem tandem bicycle built for
four.</p>

<p>exquisite weather and sun and slight breeze on the
sidewalk by long beach Los Angeles.

<p>Respeck my athoratie!!! as we honk at the
pedestrians on the sidewalk!</p>

<p class=date>5:46 pm</p>

<p>WOW!!!!</p>

<p>Flying wings easy recovery from bonks midair
collisions and the guy I talked  to was talking to me
no problem and he  had only been flying for a couple
months!!   Quite  amazing!!!  totally silent with no 
motor gliders with only independent ailerons on each
wing.</p>

<p>$50 for the kit then gotta buy a radio.  One type
of wing is called a boomerang and the other a zig zag
I think he said.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>synchronized kite flying like airforce jets and now
seeing some big n's that could lift a body??</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>oh awesome!  The big ns were big enough to lift
their person off the ground. But the  coolest thing
was they surfed!!   Doubly  cool is that my motel is
within 2 blocks of the beach!!  Super awesome.</p>

<p>I think I *might* visit the beach tonight!  Or
maybe watch the sun set  over the water.</p>

<p class=note>(written 25 April:  false.)</p>

<p class=date>7:04 pm</p>

<p>We ate dinner type something at an internet cafe.  
I checked my email which indicated that I hadn't made
all the requested changes to the datasets that our
Singapore peeps requessted.  Doh!</p>

<p>I asked her to resend the changes and I'll have
Dave or someone  implement them  tomorrow.  I CCed all
of them that the changes need to be made.  it will all
work out.</p>

<p>Also at the intenet cafe was a <em>super</em> cute
girl who reminded me of the lead singer from Til
Tuesday.  can't remember her name,  nor did  I find
out the cafe girl's name.  She was still pretty
cute.</p>

<p>Now we are in the opening cermony of the SAS
conference thing..  They are asking us to squeeze in
toward the center  of the seats.. One guy was all, 'is
this (seat that I'm sitting in) the center?  If so
everyone should come closer to me.'  Ha ha very funny 
mister.   Move over.  ;-)</p>

<p>Riding the tandem tandem bike was great fun for 1.5
hours.  All kinds of flying things on the beach, but I
must say the flying wings were the coolest.</p>

<p>Wow.  This is a pretty city.  We spent the whole
afternoon on Long Beach, riding a 4 person bicycle. 
We = me, Kevin, Kevin's sister Kathy, and her son AJ. 
Kevin and I are here for SUGI 26, the conference for
all the SAS-geeks in the world like us.</p>

<p>They have a huge bank of terminals set up so we can
check mail or... write journal entries.  Nice.</p>

<p>Un-nice is that I did not (apparently) make all the
changes to the dataset that our Singapore peeps
requested.  I replied to her and CC'd people at work
so they will be able to make the changes for me.  It
will all work great.</p>

<p>I've written some stuff in my Handspring Visor, but
of all the things, most cool today was seeing these
guys remote-control flying these wings.  Just wings. 
My dad used to build and fly model airplanes, but
these were just wings with no fuselage, no tail, no
engine.  They did have vertical stabilizers, but no
rudders.  Just an aileron on each wing.  So awesome
that they could fly so perfectly silently like a flock
of bats in one little airspace where the ocean wind
blew in and ^^UP^^ the beachfront embankment,
providing ample lift for these wings.  Very very cool.
 The guy I spoke with said a kit was about $50 and 10
hours of work to build it.  Buy a radio transmitter to
control the servos in the wing and presto instant fun
for the afternoon.</p>

<p>They were awesomely manueverable and recoverable
and stable.  By recoverable I mean that when they
bonked into each other (often intentionally), they
usually didn't end up on the ground.  A slight dive
then swoop away out of danger.  Stable because they
would start a flight just by "setting" the wing on the
wind, as if it were a table.  The wing just flew away.
 So so amazing!!</p>

<p>I'll look for a website for them...  Hold
please.</p>

<p>That was easy.  <a

<p class=date>7:19am CDT Saturday 21 April 2001</p></p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>Driving to the U2 concert, I was concerned that I had
no money for parking; I would have to flirt/talk my way in to being
able to park.  I was also late for the show I thought.  I talked to a
girl in a relatively empty hallway, asking her where I could park my
car and not be charged for it.  She was all, "well, really nowhere.."
so I gave her a kiss/bite/nibble on the neck and she was more like,
"well, you can probably park over there.." and we talked a bit more
and then I was going to go in to the show.  I realized that I had an
extra ticket to the concert that I could sell for money for
parking.</p>

<p class=dream>I walked back out toward where the lines should be
forming and now a lot of people were in line, a lot of them wearing
big bright bold costumes like Mardi Gras style headdresses and
stuff.</p>

<p class=dream>I asked someone what time the show was and indicated it
started soon, but I wasn't late since the lines were just forming.</p>

<p class=dream>I went back inside to resolve the parking concern and
the dream faded away</p>

<p>Last night when I went to see Jim Rose Circus, I had very few
dollars, and I suspected there would be something I might want to (or
have to buy).  They had a 2 drink minimum, and I got two little-ass
expensive-ass waters, but still ended up not paying; Curtis paid for
it all.  For this I am quite thankful.</p>

<p>Attending the show last night seems to have manifested as attending
the U2 concert in my dream, but I'm not sure why it was U2.  Oh, and
having the extra ticket in my dream was because 2 guys last night had
3 extra tickets that they were selling for 1/2 price to anyone who
happened to walk up and need tickets.</p>

<p>I'm at AJ and Kathy's  house - Kevin' nephew and
sister..  We are in Los Angeles for a conference thing
called SUGI.  It's the 26th annual, and my first.</p>

<p>But the point is that we just played scrable and
had a pretty good time though Kevin basically
whippppped our butts.   I  got a cool word - zed which
I didn't know if it was a non-name (Zed's dead baby,
Zed's daed.') but turns out that it's another name for
the letter Z.</p>

<p>Bedtime now. It's only 1:15 here, but 3:15 to my
brain and we have to be up around 6:45am.</p>

<p>Oh- I rearranged AJ's unzippable rezippable pants. 
They have short medim long length portions and now he
has a short pant leg and a LONG  pant leg.   well past
his foot.</p>
