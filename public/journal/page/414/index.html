<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>In a futuristic setting, needed to travel by getting
inside a tube that would launch me like through a slide (like on
Jetsons or Futurama) except we sometimes had two way traffic in the
same tube and would have to like suck in a gut or try to squish over
to one side to get past.  I didn't always know which side and one time
I went past a guy who had a candle that he was taking to a birthday
party and the candle blew out as we passed each other.</p>

<p class=dream>The candle was like for a wedding or something and I
felt bad for blowing it out before he got it there.  But I found out a
chance to make it up to him, for the Don, the Godfather of his family
was going to walk by a row of people while holding the candle pointing
it toward us and the one person who could light the candle as he
walked by would get his endless gratitude.</p>

<p class=dream>Endless gratitude from the Godfather seemed pretty good
to me, (plus I wanted to make it up to him) so I got a match and lit
it just as he was about to walk past me.  He was a short guy, really
fat, about the size of the dwarf on Twin towers, but looked more like
an Italian cat than a dwarf with huge beard.</p>

<p class=dream>I didn't get the candle lit.  So close I was as I held
my little birthday candle up to his as he walked by, but no luck; my
candle went out just as he arrived.</p>

<p class=dream>I was totally like, "d'oh!!" and *<em>ran</em>* as fast
as I could around the corner to get back to where my table of friends
sat and hollered "does anyone have a lighter?" and two people pulled
lighters out of their pockets and threw them to me as I ran toward
that table and did a quick stop to run back toward the Godfather.  I
didn't exactly catch both lighters in midair, but I did retrive them
both pretty quickly and ran back to the line just as the Godfather was
finishing the line.  He seemed to not be anywhere, but then I saw him
chillin' against a wall, with his big fur vest on and a big pimp
hat.</p>

<p class=dream>I lit both lighters and walked up to him.  I didn't see
the candle, but he smiled as I approached.</p>

<p class=dream>The candle incident seemed to be forgotten, but he
accepted both lighters and mockingly lit a cigar, an air cigar for it
was a pparent there was no cigar.  He lauged at his own little joke.
At least the Godfather was happy.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>It had been a long time since I played anything at
KTRU, but I was going through my CDs and noticed that I had a CD that
KTRU used to have, but no longer had; the case was still there but the
CD was missing.  (This happens more often at KTRU than an honest DJ
might like)</p>

<p class=dream>The particular CD I found was one that I bought a long
time ago at Record Rack; I could tell because the price sticker was
still on the <em>face</em> of the CD instead of the back of the CD, or
even the case where it should be.  Plus the sticker said Record Rack
on it.</p>

<p class=dream>I put the CD on the turntable, which was behind some
bushes across from the elementary school on Decker Prairie-Rosehill
Road near my dad's house.  I chose the left hand turntable, instead of
the right hand one because the left hand one was about 1/2 a block
closer to where I had left my computer plugged in.</p>

<p class=dream>Put the CD in and played it while KTRU was actually
broadcasting a basketball game.  I didn't intend to broadcast it
<em>over</em> the basketball game, but just to preview it in the
studio.</p>

<p class=dream>I went back to looking through CDs while this one was
playing, and I suddenly realized I *might* be accidentally
broadcasting it over the game; I ran up to look and was horrified to
realize that's exactly what I had done.</p>

<p class=dream>I was surprised no one had called during this
apparently rebellious act; I hoped no one had heard it (that no one
was listening to the game), but I knew I must try to explain myself
and get it resolved before Rice Administration found out and tried to
shut down the station again.</p>

<p class=dream>Ran down the escalator out of the shopping mall/school,
wondering to whom I should address the email, and decided to just
write it to the KTRU email list, plus Will Robidee and Johnny So, the
most recent station manager that I knew of.  Summarized the points of
my letter in my mind: 1) that I was replacing a CD KTRU used to have,
2) that I hadn't DJed there in a while so I wasn't an official DJ and
all the blame could therefore be put on me and make a policy that
said, "no unofficial DJs allowed spinning records (which already is a
policy) and 3) that some other DJ had inappropriately left the volume
up and the red button pushed on the turntable input on the board.</p>

<p class=dream>I ran back toward the apartment where I was staying
with Amelia (Springfield) and she was just walking up to the outside
door at the same time.  I used my copy of her key and opened the
outside door, ran up the stairs and couldn't get the right key to open
the inside door, so I threw my keys down in disgust and waited for her
to open the door.  She did and the air conditioner guy was also just
walking in.</p>

<p class=dream>He looked at the thermostat and clicked the reset
button, saying, "there you go; all fixed," for we had been having a
problem with keeping the house warm enough.  I asked him calmly and
patiently what he thought was keeping the reset button needing to be
reset twice in two days (there must be an underlying issue, for which
this was simply a band-aid).  He agreed there must be something else
and would look into it for us.</p>

<p class=dream>While he looked, I stated flatly, "okay, I've
<em>got</em> to write this letter to KTRU" and went back to the desk
and pulled my computer out.  I was thankful that I had apparently
remembered it, but realized that I had forgotten the power supply and
would have to go back and get it.  Fortunately I would not need it
immediately; the battery was fully charged.</p>

<p class=dream>As I prepared to write, I remembered that I hadn't
actually written about the Godfather dream yet, and then realized that
hey this was a dream, and I *did* have the power supply for my
computer, and even better; I hadn't broadcast a song over the
basketball game on KTRU after all.</p>

<p>Ahhhhh.  such relief.</p>

<p>From my friend Ginnie in Europe:</p>

<pre>
Subject: A Dutch Christmas

Hello Party Lovers! Excuse me for not sending the last mail when i
wrote it, i guess better late than never (like my Christmas presents
in the mail?). I guess i will fire the october mail off to you next
week.  A little out of order, but oh well!

       I have been in the Netherlands for several months now.  The day
or two after I wrote the last e-mail, I went to the local college to
get my deposit back on a Dutch language textbook I had borrowed in the
spring then completed while working nights last summer.  The director
had me written into the class roster the next day and for 10 Euros
more over 500 hours of Dutch lessons and 4 textbooks.  I skipped into
the 2nd grade because of my cool night shift hobby, and it is back to
school. Now, Christmas Vacation!!!!! I did not pay attention in
English class, so now i have another opportunity to learn about
similar parts of speech diagramming, only in another order with some
spicy twists.  Like the first time around, i need to study more, but i
figure there is a reason it takes a while to learn the language.  A
language is only a very small part of the total cultural change.  To
understand it all at once, or within a very short period of time is
asking a lot of the mind.  I give myself some slack remembering that i
learned French last winter in the mountains by myself.  I had contact
with people three times a month or so, so it must have been the radio
that i resurrected and could listen to while the sun was shining on
the solar panel.

      This winter I am living similar challenges, only at the opposite
extremes.  Last year I was not living on the mountain a month or so
before i got used to the fact that there was going to be no surprise
visitors, I was on my own, to do what i wanted and so I cut wood
without a shirt on and sung songs at the top of my lungs and stood
outside in the middle of the night looking at the stars until the sky
turned pink.  This year I am in the Japan of Europe.  I am in the
middle of the country, and there are houses all around us.  I have to
be dressed to walk around on the inside of the house.  I bought a
sewing machine and have made curtains that i gave to Ron for Christmas
today.  I feel like a real hillbilly trying to fit into small village
life again.  For the most part things are perfect.  i am living the
dream.

     Christmas in Holland is really the second place December gift
giving holiday.  Sinterklaas is on December 5th and according to their
legend the American Santa Clause is his cousin.  I would say more his
grand son.  I had the pleasure going to the local elementary school to
see Ron perform as Sinterklaas on December 5th.  He was accompanied by
Zwarte Piet.  Actually two Zwarte Piets.  These are white Dutch guys
that rub some kind of black shoe polish on their face and hands and
dress up like jokers or joker/pirates.  The story is that Sinterklaas
was born in 343 AD in Turkey (Miro).  He lives in Madrid.  He was a
Bishop, and wears a big red bishop's hat with a crusaders white cross
on the front.  He has a staff, and long dark red velvet robes and a
very long white beard.  He was a Bishop that gave gifts to children a
very long time ago.  In good Spanish style, he gives gifts the day
before his birthday (on December 6th). Every year, at the end of
November, he makes the trip by boat to Holland ( i think some stories
say he goes to Amsterdam first). He comes with some slaves called
Zwarte Piet.  This character is essential but definitely a politically
incorrect character these days.  Zwarte Piet is a clown, joking and
throwing candy and pepernoten (gingerbread spices cookie drops) and
pulling pranks on the kids.  He is also the guy who keeps Sinterklaas'
naughty-and-nice list.  The real bad kids get stuffed in his sack and
taken on the boat back to Spain to work as slaves for Zwarte Piet
(like Santa's elves) making the pepernoten.  The bad kids get beaten
by switches that are all bundled up (an old time broom).  They used to
really beat the kids!  They are usually not friendly characters, but
Ron says these days they are much nicer, when he was a kid they were
scared of Zwarte Piet! People also give and receive presents on the
5th, but there are many nice presents like big Chocolate letters (the
first letter of your first name), and almond spice pastry rolls and
little typical Dutch treats they make just for Sinterklaas and people
exchange for the weeks preceding Sinterklaas.  Sinterklaas is mostly
for kids.

    In class we were supposed to bring a gift for a person whose name
we drew for a secret gift exchange.  Of course the little gift i
wanted to give was not ready yet because i wanted to make it on the
full moon, so i gave another one (i was supposed to buy one).  My
understanding of the Dutch language is still very limited, and my poem
was about all of the different Christmas traditions that my class
mates have.  Russian Christmas with The Snowman and his lady helper.
Baba Noel in Egypt.  Ramadan was over and the Zuiker Feest (the big
party day after the long Muslim day-fasting period) fell on the 5th of
December too!  I thought my poem was so clever, oh gawd!!!! 10 shades
of red later (which gave me away as the culprit) i realized my poem
was supposed to be about the person and the gift to them. Anyway, it
was to my teacher, and the poem was a twist.  I am glad I did not have
to see my grade on that gift.

   So today is a little more vague in the peoples minds, Sinterklaas
went home on the boat December 6th, and they don't really expect his
cousin to come for the 25th.  This is when people have trees with
lights on the windows. It is similar, but not the same.  I have to
remind myself that today is a day of many faces and conditions on our
world, like any other.  I also remind myself that today is filled with
so many expectations, and victories of giving and defeats of
disappointment.  What direction is it going?  Are we coming together?
I guess I can keep the highest thought in mind and believe thatl soon
it will be Christmas for everybody, that humanity will pull through
for one another and we will get there in not such a distant future. At
least December 25th in Holland is mostly a day with the family.
Christmas lasts two days, the 25th and the 26.  It is still a surprise
what is going to happen today, and we will see about tomorrow still.
I bet New Years Eve will be quite similar to most everywhere else
though.  This is like culture shock in Holland.  I am going to sign
off now, i am going to go see what Christmas in Holland is like.  We
are going to Ron's parents house for the evening.  I do miss being
with my family, I Love You!  Merry Christmas and Happy New Year
Everybody!!!  I hope you have impeccable luck and health for all your
days to come!  Love, gin

<p>Well, I'm leaving later than I had originally planned, but it's
cool since my schedule is so loose.</p>

<p>I wonder if I'll be able to charge my computer easily along the way
home; I don't have any scheduled stops at people's homes where I can
just plug in.</p>

<p>We've been playing Animal Crossing.  My character now owes Tom Nook
148,000 bells.  Actually 146,000 since I paid him 2 G's.</p>

<p>Silly addicting game!</p>

<p>Rolling out sooonishly.  After I get packed.</p>

<p>Leaving Dude & Veronica's now.  I just scoped out my intended path
back; I'm not going to go through the 7000+ foot mountains to visit
Lake Tahoe and Reno and such.  Scott's feet are not treaded well
enough for all of that.</p>

<p>So I'm basically going to go down the 5 to LA and turn east on I-40.</p>

<p>Might go by Four Corners.  Might not.  Have to get to that area and
see what my schedule is like.</p>

<p>3710.2 miles on this trip so far.  I'm basically at the
north-west-most point of my adventure.  Certainly my mileage will be
less than twice this amount since my path back will be slightly more
direct.</p>

<p>152211 miles on Scott.  Roll out.</p>

<p>(thanks, Ludacris)</p>

<p class=date>2:45pm</p>

<p>3710.8 miles on my trip so far.  I'm back at Dude's.  I forgot my bike.</p>

<p class=date>4:56pm</p>

<p>3827.2 miles traveled.</p>

<p>Just drove backwards on the shoulder to get a picture: "Entering
Josephine County" for Josephine.</p>

<p class=date>6:08pm</p>

<p>3885 miles traveled.  I've taken a little detour to see the Redwood
Forest.  It's going to be quite dark when I'm there, apparently, and I
don't really want to spend the night there so soon in my trek.  But
we'll see once I get there how it goes.</p>

<p class=date>7:18pm</p>

<p>Wow.  The Redwoods are big.  I've gotta come back here during the
day sometime.</p>

<p>This time my Redwood Forest tour was like, "wow, there's big trunk.
Ooh, that trunk is really big.  Woah, look at that trunk!"</p>

<p>3934 miles traveled.</p>

<p>Christmas Eve has been pretty lazy, with me and Veronica playing
Animal Crossing, and Veronica and Pablo cooking an amazing dinner
while Dude and I sponged on the couch watching Tech TV (featuring the
beautiful Megan (who is now pregnant) and Morgan as the hosts for a
day with the regular hosts gone (on vacation?)) and Dude playing
Civilization.</p>

<p>I vaguely sorta kinda worked on a new perl project I'm working on
for Wende so she can store passwords securely on my website (and once
it's working I may allow others to do the same thing), hopefully
solving the problem of having to remember too many username and
passwords for a variety of websites strewn about the internet.</p>

<p>After fabulous dinner of crepes around spinach and italian bread,
we opened presents.  I got nothing for anyone, not even for the dogs
Bailey and Remington, but everyone got me something.  I feel thankful
and indebted.  I realize now that I haven't even replied to my mom
when she asked me some days ago where I would be for Christmas.  I
didn't know for sure at the time she wrote, and as the answer became
apparent, I still didn't write to a parent.</p>

<p>Anyway, Dude got me a conservative tie as a gag gift (no pun
intended) and I said I'll use it in Japan.  They also got me a $20
gift card from SAM'S so I can change my oil at some SAM'S on the way
back, *and* a roadside assistance case (tools, battery terminal
cleaner, ponchos, light, blanket, *plus* a 24 hour free roadside
assistance up to three times in the next year from date of purchase).
Holy cow wow!!</p>

<p>I think we're going to jump into the hot tub in the cold outside.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>With five other men from my men's group, or some men's
group (though Wende may have been one of them) we were in a house that
looked a lot like my dad's house, at least in the ceiling.  We needed
to paint the ceiling white.  With six people, I suggested we either
get into three teams of two or two teams of three, and I knew of a way
for each setup to work.  With three people per team, one person
paints, another person watches for missed spots, and another person
gets the missed spots, plus wipes up spots that shouldn't have been
painted (oh and the second person gets supplies as needed).</p>

<p class=dream>They thought this was a pretty good system, which I had
described while I was painting te ceiling with a broom, which worked
relatively well - long handle, bristles..</p>

<p class=dream>So I went outside to get a ladder to be the third person
and second combined by getting supplies because someone had gotten
paint on the wood paneled support beam at the top of the ceiling.</p>

<p class=dream>I went outside to the back yard and down a hill to get
my dad's extension ladder and first I just picked it up and threw it
down to see where any wasps may be on the thing so I could spray them
merceilessly and kill them (we don't have much compassion for wasps
around my dad's house) (not that anyone is allergic, bt there are just
plenty of wasps living in other places besides the ladder that I need
to use).</p>

<p class=dream>One wasp flew up and I could see a large pile of mud
indicating the location of mud dauber nests, so I went back inside to
get some Raid and a stick to knock off the mud.  (*)</p>

<p class=dream>Inside I found a stick and they were basically waiting
for me to get the ladder, so I ran back outside and used the stick to
spray Raid on the one wasp and it didn't die, but just flew away
before the Raid could get to it.</p>

<p class=dream>I used the stick to knock off the mud nests and most of
them broke off in one big chunk, and hopefully didn't die.</p>

<p class=dream>I tossed the ladder one more time to wake up anything
else there might be living on it, but nothing else moved.</p>

<p class=dream>So I brought the ladder inside and did not have to use
the extension to make it reach the celing with the paint on it.  But
the paint had already mostly dried so I had to use some alcohol
combined with wood colored dye to remove/cover up the white paint on
the wood at the top of the celiing.  (**)</p>

<p>(*) at this point I had actually woken up from my dream, but I just
wrote more in a sleepy state.</p>

<p>(**) at this point I fell asleep again.</p>

<p>Been playing <em>Animal Crossing</em> on a Nintendo Gamecube.  It's
for little kids, but pretty fun and somewhat addicting.  It's like a
simplified non-aggressive non-violent version of Civilization or some
such.  Although there is fishing in this game, which could be seen as
aggressive or violent toward fish.</p>

<p>The computer driven characters in the game "keep doing stuff" even
if the human players don't play, thereby simulating that time has
passed in the game, making human players not want to miss anything and
play more more more!</p>

<p>Veronica is playing now.  Her character's name is Cutie.  Mine is
named Bunny.  Pablo's is named Morcheba.</p>

<p>We have one free house in the town if you'd like to join.</p>

<p>Veronica hadn't played since October, so she owed the town
banker/store owner interest on what she owed him previously.  She now
owes him like 10 times the amount that I owe him, which is presumably
how much she used to owe him.  (this is basically to purchase a house
in the town.)</p>

<p>Pablo says that if one plays long enough, the townsfolk will build
a statue of the player in the middle of town.  Wow.</p>

<p>We hopped into the hottub which started at 106 degrees F and slowly
cooled to F 102 over a period of about 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Dude and I remained in it the longest, but he, by far, had the
greatest amount of time in the water.  I was in and out, maintaining
my body temperature at a more comfortable level than boiled.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>They are watching <em>Meet The Parents</em> in the other room.
It's a movie that I don't really like so I'm not watching.</p>

<p><em>Zoolander</em> is a far superior Ben Stiller movie.  Heck,
<em>Mystery Men</em> is better.</p>

<p>Dude just came in here with me to play on computers.  I guess he
doesn't really like it either.  Nope, he doesn't.</p>
