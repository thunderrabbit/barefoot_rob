<p>Chillin' at Amy's now after chuch.  The service featured the Men's
Gorilla Orchestra and Chorus, started by Mark Holt back in the day.  I
messed myself up by predicting Katie would sit by me but when Meagan
Holt sat by me she was all, "do you remember me?"  Ummmm and it didn't
*look* like Katie; wrong color hair and all that, but my brain was
locked on that name and I tried to see Katie in Meagan, but it wasn't
working.  Then she told me.  D'oh!  of course.</p>

<p>Great to see people and soul-connect with Char "to be continued"
Crofut.</p>

<p>Saw other cool cats: Hallie, Bob Finney, Larry, Bob Ellis, Mary and
Terry, Mary and Jon, and all the others whose name I've forgotten.
Oh, and Tina, and Johnny.  And the rest.  here on gilligan's
island.</p>

<p class=date>4:47pm</p>

<p>Still chillin' at Amy-Katie-Mary-Terry's house (in reverse age
order).  Freddo is here too.  Mary and Terry just got back from Hawaii
this morning I believe.  She's wearing fake plumeria and a lei and
hibiscus.  They stayed on Maui I think.</p>

<p>Been talking a bit to Amy's granddad who's from Indiana.</p>

<p>Terry and Amy's grandma are cooking in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Fred and I left before dinner started; didn't get to see Katie
again who had left to get her boyfriend.</p>

<p>Fred turned left on Gosling and drove a long ass way before
deciding that there was no convenient connection to Woodlands Parkway,
but not before we saw three kids beating up another kid.</p>

<p>On the way back we stopped, but he said he was okay.  Fred said he
had just finished crying and neither of us saw any bruises or cuts.  I
hope they can figure this out without killing anyone.</p>

<p>Now Fred and I are at Northwoods to chill.</p>

<p class=date>6:38pm</p>

<p>We went through Tamarac park to the school playground where we
played a bit of follow the leader and then I climbed up a 15 foot pole
except it was two poles about 18 inches apart.  They were wearing a
small curved hat to keep kids from climbing any higher; they'd hit
their head on the hat.</p>

<p>I climbed on top of the hat.</p>

<p>I was about to get down when I realized I should stand on the hat.
My only opportunity to stand on a hat on top of two poles.  Gotta do
it now.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Talked to Fred and listened to his latest electronic adventures in
breaking up with Kat.  They are like in the final chapter it seems.
Probably shouldn't write that publically, but it's not anything he
wouldn't tell anyone except Kat and her best friend so don't tell
them.   Anyway, the point is that Fred and I haven't really talked
about girl issues before.  We're just getting into that and I'm
thankful for the closer connection.</p>

<p>I rode with my dad to get a tiller and 2 yards of dirt.  The
trailer tires needed air after the dirt was added, so we pulled into a
gas station.  It seems that when the trailer went across the (minor)
dip of transition between street and parking lot, one of the axel
connectors broke.</p>

<p>Dad analyzed it and seems we need to jack the trailer up, shift the
something and put it all back together.</p>

<p>I trust we can do it and still let me hang out with Marcel
today.</p>

<p class=date>12:04pm</p>

<p>Took the trailer off the truck.</p>

<p>Took the tiller off the trailer and tossed it into the truck.</p>

<p>Going now to get a 5 ton jack.</p>

<p class=date>12:06pm</p>

<p>Someone in a vehicle, looks like a drak gray brown Jeep Cherokee
type thing purchased at Copeland (here in Tomball) with TX plates F25
YPL, just threw a plastic bottle into the grass by the road.</p>

<p>They just turned onto Sandy Lane from 249.  Maybe they live back
there.</p>

<p class=date>12:51pm</p>

<p>Have the jack from Dad's storage shed now.  Headed back to his
house where we'll get my car as well so I can leave separately if
necessary.</p>

<p>A couple days ago I removed 3 names from my LJ friends list.
Adrienne, Chez's cousin Paul, and Megan I think.  Adrienne emailed me,
asked me why I had removed her.</p>

<p>Fuck.</p>

<p>I told her it was because of the length of her entries, and though
I encourage long journal entry writing, I don't have the
patience/attention to read long entries. I think journals out to be
written for ourselves, not written for others.  (That's a big fat hard
thing to do with my journal online, but I'm getting better at writing
more of what I would write in my private book.)</p>

<p>Then I went to her journal and find that the recent 20 entries
aren't all that long.  Hmmm.</p>

<p>I read through the remains of my friends list and find that I
wasn't really reading most of the entries.  Only about 3 or 4 people's
entries do I read.  Maybe more.  I seem to read the entries of people
who I know well.  That makes sense.</p>

<p>So, do I go slaughter more of my friends list?  Alienate more people?</p>

<p>I've got too much fucking internet stuff on my daily plate already:
emails, email lists, friends lists, writing my own journal, world
news... argh fuck.</p>

<p>I'm on the edge of a cleaning mode, where I might just shred my LJ
friends list or erase it altogether.  But I know I won't erase it
altogether.</p>

<p>Maggie just called; she locked her keys in her car.  In Pearland.
That's not exactly around the corner, but it is in Texas.  Even in the
greater Houston area.</p>

<p class=date>10:16pm</p>

<p>Got a map on mapquest.  Leaving Maggie's now.  Got my iTunes
rocking.  NIN happens to be on first.</p>

<p>How can I possibly have not written about the fun fun times with
Marcel, Adriene, Nicholas, then Kayse, Laurie, Brianna?  Legos with
Adrien while Marcel worked on my computer.</p>

<p>And talking for two hours with Janette.  Just lovely lovely
lovely.  How could two hours have gone by so fast????</p>

<p class=date>11:12pm</p>

<p>got a bit lost.  but I've arrived.  42 miles</p>

<p class=date>11:24pm</p>

<p>Hahahahah talk about underdressed with my T-shirt, shorts, no
shoes, in a crowd of tuxes, suits, dresses.  Walked out arm and arm
with Maggie, as she was wearing a dramatic purple dress with crazy
purple hat and purse and boa or something.</p>

<p class=date>12:09am</p>

<p>Back at Maggie's.  82.2 miles driven.</p>

<p>Wow; I beat them home!</p>

<p>Okay, so the shuttle blew up and that's terrible but what the fuck
is ABC <em>local</em> news thinking by breaking in on the national ABC
news that was actually telling us something interesting, interviewing
<em>knowledgeable</em> NASA employees about the shuttle and all that?
Local ABC broke in on this interview where the cat was giving us new
information to tell us fucking moronic shit like, "oh, the Johnson
Space Center is under tight security now, there's a sense of sadness
here and families are in private rooms" and fucking gossipping about
where people are from in Texas and all this bullshit; just let the
fucking families have their privacy and let them cry and don't splash
their details all over the news..  Shit!</p>

<p class=date>10:36am</p>

<p>According to the news I've been hearing:</p>

<p>Kennedy Space Center is in Houston.
<br>The accident happened around 9:00 am Central time
<br>Challenger explosion was in 1981
</p>

<p>But the worst of all, Jim Hickey of ABC News reading? ranting?  "If
the shuttle program is grounded for <em>months</em> or even
<em><b>years</b></em>, what will become of the 3 astronauts in the
International Space Station?</p>

<p>Who the hell came up with a crisis over that?  What do you think
will "become" of the 3 astronauts?  We'll fucking go back up there
with another Shuttle and pick them up!!!</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so sorry guys; it's just too risky to come back and  get
you.. the shuttle might blow up on re-entry!  You would rather starve,
right?"</p>

<p>Now c'mon Jim, you don't gotta read that.  And if you wrote it,
you're fired!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Today&rdquo; is the day the space shuttle Columbia blew up.  I&rsquo;m kinda
sad about that, since the Columbia was the original vehicle.  Now it&rsquo;s
no longer the hardworking workhorse in my mind, proudly flying for all
these years, still performing as well as its younger brethren.</p>

<p>Enjoyed watching Adrien play a train construction game on computer.
He likes the game a lot.  Interesting to see him build basically with
no plan in mind, but just tossing track sections together any way they
will go.  Marcel likened it to building with Legos and having to use
every piece in the set.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m tired as crap.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorta kinda beginning to write just whatever I want in here and
not worry about being prim and proper, about keeping consistency in
writing techniques or HTML formatting over a period of days.
Basically not caring about the possible existance of an audience.
Eminem is helping me get that.</p>

<p>Adrien wrenched my heart as they left today.  He opened the back
window of their van and was all, &ldquo;Rob?  Um, can you um, come over and
play sometime?&rdquo;   How the fuck can I tell this little kitten that I
might not see him in multiple years, so long that he&rsquo;ll probably
forget my name, forget everything about today except the lump in his
stomach that his simple query was left unfulfilled.   Same heart
wrenching as leaving Sarah in West Virginia.  Sigh.</p>

<p class=dream>I was in school, like a college situation, and it was
my last day to be there; I was leaving in the middle of the semester.
Super happy and nostalgic and went down to the cafeteria, sitting
between two girls I hadn't met before across from a friend of mine,
randomly yammering about what it will be like in my new life, and what
it will be like here when I'm gone.  Bryn was wandering around
randomly and didn't say bye to me though I'm pretty sure she knew I
was leaving.  Scotty was like, "this is it? your last day?" and gave
me a air high five across the room.</p>

<p class=dream>Fred got there as I was finishing up my bowl of
applesauce and dancing, mirroring some group of people dancing on the
other side of the table.  I felt happy enough to dance with applesauce
in the middle of the cafeteria and didn't care what anyone thought
cause today is my last day!</p>

<p>Before going to Houston I'll take Jack by the movie rental place to
hook a brotha up with a movie for him to watch while everyone else is
gone.</p>

<p class=date>10:32am</p>

<p>Okay.  I've showered, vaguely packed, remained calm.  Happy thoughts.</p>

<p class=date>10:46am</p>

<p>Jack made me a vegan sandwich for the road!  So awesome.  *And*
gave me chips *and* a coveted orange Sunkist.  MMmmmmmm</p>

<p class=date>11:34am</p>

<p>I just remembered that I forgot the two tiins of cookies Janette
gave me to take to the party.  D'oh!  but it's cool; we'll just have
more cookies to enjoy at home.  38 miles traveled so far.</p>

<p class=date>12:05pm</p>

<p>72.1 miles traveled.  I'm trying a new technique to make the trek
to Houston feel shorter: I'm stopping somewhat frequently.  I'm at a
rest area now, and will visit the next one in 91 miles.</p>

<p class=date>12:10pm</p>

<p>Driving again.</p>

<p class=date>1:26pm</p>

<p>OOps.  I just passed the next rest area.  I saw the sign for it and
then started engaging my brain again and realized I forgot my
mouthguard.  That thought process sucked up enough braincells to make
me forget all about the rest area.  168 miles driven now.  I'll stop
in Huntsville or so.</p>

<p class=date>1:32pm</p>

<p>Oops.  I missed the exit in Huntsville that I intended to take.
Okay, here's another.  If I can keep this thought in my mind for 2
more seconds.</p>

<p>Did it.  Whew.</p>

<p>175.55 miles driven.</p>

<p class=date>1:40pm</p>

<p>They didn't have Reese's Pieces!  I don't know what's up with
that.</p>

<p class=date>2:24pm</p>

<p>Freeway is blocked with a bit of construction.  From what I can see
there's a cat helping to guide a rather large frame thing that will
eventually be used to hold an exit sign or something.</p>

<p>223.2 miles traveled.</p>

<p class=date>2:53pm</p>

<p>Have just arrived at Maggie's work.  249 miles traveled, not
counting the 3 or so erased when I reset the odometer a bit after I
left, synchronizing it with 156000 miles on Scott.</p>

<p>Yay for a great and awesome super great terrific 12,000th day
party!!!  Lots of people showed up over the evening, starting with
Molly, Will and Anna, ended with Fred, though I think Charyl came in
after him.  She was only there for a minute (or five).</p>

<p>Way awesome having a book for people to sign.. Brilliant idea from
Maggie to bring markers and map pencils for lovely colors.  Oh, the
beginning of the evening was me and Maggie passing notes back and
forth like in our college days.  The highlights of our notes included
a cartoon guy slipping in menstral blood in the hallway and a poem:</p>

<pre>
If the hair has gone dred,
don't take it to bed.
If the hair's cut back,
then have a snack!
</pre>

<p>We laughed a long time on that!!</p>

<p>Kathy Fey was next after Molly and Will, I think.  Great to see
her; hadn't seen her in quite a while.</p>

<p>In order of what my memory remembers: Tim brought a 1/64th scale
remote control car available only at Radio Shack.  It was a lot of fun
to put together and drive around on the tables.  It took me a bit to
remember Cynthia's name!  I was like "eeeek!" in my mind, but I
remembered it after a bit.</p>

<p>Phat Pat and Tina were early arrivals, beginning the YRUU presence.
Pat drew a crazy couple of pictures in the *middle* of the book, which
started the chaos of people drawing all over the place in it.</p>

<p>I don't know if kT saw that I was wearing as a bracelet a necklace
she made for me a long time ago.</p>

<p>Marcel and Kayse brought Nicholas, their youngest; he's 10 weeks
old.  He slept a lot and Tina wanted to hold him, but she was too shy
to ask Kayse.</p>

<p class=date>3:26am CST Saturday 1 February 2003</p>

<p>I'm tired.  I went to Eckerd's (closed), Randall's & Kroger's,
looking for a mouthguard thing.  R & K were open, but didn't stock
what I want.  At Maggie's now.  Read through the black book, which has
more than 1/2 blank pages it seems, but they are strewn throughout the
book.</p>

<p>I want to write lots more, but I'm mostly just flat tired.  I'll
write 5 more things tonight:</p>

<p>~) It was fun driving the 1/64 car in circles inside a pizza dish
cover</p>

<p>!) Kristen and Catherine mostly stuck together during Silent
Football, though they didn't last long in the game.  They were all
talking and not paying attention, given they saw no real purpose to
the game.  When I put Fred between them, I meant it as a punishment to
him since he had wanted to get away from them, but they didn't take
too kindly to that and they both merged to one seat beside Fred.</p>

<p>@) Jennifer from PT! brought the bowls that Erika and I painted.
Erika did not show up.  Jennifer's friend Sarah smelled really good.
I would have enjoyed hugging her twice, but didn't want to be too
obvious or make her feel uncomfortable.</p>

<p>#) Tim also gave me a Jillian's card with 3000 points on it.  After
most everyone left, Fred, Maggie and I put most of the food in to-go
boxes and then played games downstairs.  To show for our efforts, we
have a Chinese Finger Trap.</p>

<p>$) Listening to the music through the walls like we did seemed a
lot like living in the dorms.</p>

<p>I almost fell asleep sitting up before I thought of number 5.  Good
night.</p>

<p class=date>10:56am CST Saturday 1 February 2003</p>

<p>Some people didn't arrive who I had hoped to see: Ricky Shaw, Jason
Fricke, Erika Stuebing, anyone in my I-group..  I hope they didn't get
lost; part of me feels guilty like maybe I could have given them
better directions or I should have had a cell phone number they could
call.  Well, that was my feeling last night.  Today I'm like fuck
that; everyone else got there okay, including Rie who cannot yet speak
uber-fluent English.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>%) Steve McLeod describing his technique of money between friends.
He never loans money to anyone.  Only gives it, and expresses that
clearly.  That way he never gives more than he can give, and he never
loses a friend over the gift.  Wonderful wisdom.</p>

<p>^) Getting to see Joannah of Night With Joannah fame from my old
ultimate days.  I never joined the group for a Night With Joannah, but
it was cool to have her come to one of my parties to make it an NWJ.</p>

<p class=date>10:19pm CST Monday 3 February 2003</p>

<p>&) Maggie loves Joannah's smile.  It makes her gasp each time she
sees it.</p>

<p>*) Maggie threw an overhand huck to the endzone on a 10 count in
ultimate.  When Joannah was all alone in the endzone to catch it for the
moral victory of the season, Maggie ran up to her, hugged her, spun
her around for joy.  Maggie might have a bigger crush on Joannah than I.
PS Maggie doesn't know that she wants this public.</p>

<p>() Mark Leonard was there; he's the one that found the cool
days-old counter.  He was wearing a fly silk shirt from Brazil I
think.  He told us about being captain of an ultimate team in Italy!
Like, he's the captain now because he says this league is the best in
the world and the team was awesome but no one would step up as captain
so he's doing it.  Amazing.</p>

<p>)) Eric and Meredith were there though I didn't get to talk to
them too much.  Meredith had changed in the car before arrival.
Meredith heard that I'm putting all or most of my expenses on credit
card and she was all, "as your financial advisor, I encourage you
<em>not</em> to do that, but you'll do whatever you want, I know."
She's looking way fitter and trimmer!</p>

<p>_) All my parents where there, starting with Ma and Jon who were
relatively early arrivals.  I didn't really talk to them too much,
though Jon filmed me telling the story of the time I followed Marcel
and Kayse around on one of their first days hanging out until Marcel
was all, "um.. we're going to hang out alone..."  " ... Oh!!".  Good
times.  Dad and Karen were there, and I made it around to them just as
they were leaving.  Told them about my latest Japanese news.</p>

<p>~+) Daniel was there; he gave me a cool little silver ring with
smiley face on it and a card.  Good to see him; he's looking fitter
and trimmer!  Oh and the cool thing is that he's up in Dallas on
occasion and may come visit me before I fly out.</p>

<p>~!) Our servers (not mail servers, but female servers) were Tami
and Elizabeth.  Roger L Jackson Jr was the first guy who helped set
stuff up.  Charles Chkaiban was the general manager.</p>

<p>~@) Phat Pat had a funny story about a store not accepting as valid
a temporary ID card, because he was wearing a jacket that said Mark on
it.  "So you're going to trust a <em>jacket</em> more than a valid
Texas ID??</p>

<p>~#) Anna drew mightily on the book and on the tablecloth.</p>

<p>~$) Nick drew an awesome brain of cathodes and vaccuum tubes in a
head.  Rie drew a page of Japanese text that I cannot yet read.  Jerry
drew a cool pic depicting the UH ultimate field with him hucking a
disc long to me.</p>

<p>~%) Jerry brought his friend Patty; it was cool to meet her.  She's
apparently been to some other ultimate type things.  He offered to buy
me a beer or something and the offered to buy me a game downstairs,
but I never left the party while he was there to let him do it.</p>

<p>~^) Maggie loved Phat Pat's suggestion box story!  I think Maggie
loves stories so much that she should hang out with Pat some and hear
lots more.</p>

<p>~&) Nathan and kT came; it was great to see them.  Didn't *really*
get to talk to them, but they were part of Silent Football at the end
of the night.</p>

<p>~*) Maggie, kT, Nathan, Tina, Pat, Nick, Fred, Kristen, Catherine,
Rie, Joannah, and I as dictator played Silent Football.  (Yay Maggie for
remembering the order!)  We started out with normal names, but soon
Nathan turned to "Mr Slouchy" and Pat turned to "Mr I'm a Moron" and
Nick became "Reverand Nick."  Then Nathan sat up straight and became
"Mr Vertical" and Fred became "Mr Slouchy."  Then when Fred and kT
were tossing the football back and forth relentlessly I put a wormhole
between them to stop that madness rather quickly.  Then Fred moved the
football to himself about 10 or 15 times in a row.  Maggie said Maggie
was impressed with how well Fred played with himself.  Nick expressed
that Fred's playing with Fred's self was sinful and vile, and an
insult to the sacred universee.  Nick was rather dismayed with the
wormhole in general; he hadn't played a game with one in it yet.</p>

<p>~() After Catherine and Kristen left, Joannah did what she claimed
to be the correct version of the Roger Rabbit for us after having
Shrugged a Schrodem.  Kristen had done it a couple of times during the
rules, which might explain why she didn't really know how to play.</p>

<p>~)) At one point, Reverand Nick said horseshit as the finale of
some complaint.  Maggie was all, "Mr Dictator, where in the bible is
there a reference to horseshit?"  me: "Reverand Nick, will Reverand
Nick please quote the bible verse containing the term
'horseshit'?"</p>

<p>Of course, Nick did this flawlessly, in a most hilarious manner!
If only a recording of it had been made.  Hmmm maybe hypnosis could
get it back.</p>

<p>~_) Rie and Joannah did a fantastic job playing for their first
times.  Pat coached Rie a lot at first, which is most of what Nathan
complained about, or at least a great deal of it.</p>

<p>!+) I'm talking to Maggie now about possibly starting a Pick Up
Silent Football game.  Oh my gosh Maggie is the <em>best!!</em></p>

<p>!~) kT brought me a white chocolate Kit Kat!  Oh wait, that was at
Houston Rally.  Good to see her again so soon!</p>

<p>!!) Kristen and Catherine notarized a statement in the book that
they had been to my party.</p>

<p>!@) Someone did a Zoom a Zoom Zoom dance, and someone else did a
Fwap a Fwap Fwap dance, but we can't remember who they were.  Nathan
refused to do Little Bunny Foo Foo so he I had him do it in sign
language.</p>
