<p>Have just gotten back from applying for Josephine's passport and
transferring Scott's title to Janette.  Effectively to Josephine but
she doesn't have a driver's license yet.  Stuff like that.</p>

<p>On the way out of the Dallas Records building (Courthouse?) I saw a
news truck so I asked the guy in the truck what was the big news.</p>

<p>"There's a water fountain in there that says 'whites only'"</p>

<p>Holy shit.</p>

<p>He downplayed it as worthy news, but I'm thinking dammmmmmmmm.</p>

<p>Today I, well last night I put some pictures on my website from the
weekend and one from the New Years party.  Phat Pat and Mike Holcomb
(no e) watched.</p>

<p>Today Laura Douglas and Kelly, no Callie, no you're right Kelly
came over.</p>

<p>OH And my rant for the day:  The fucking Texas Department of
Transportation website has a PDF with a blatant grammar/logic flaw.
The top of the page is has text like "I hereby understand that I am
filling this out.  If you fill it out wrong, you are still liable."</p>

<p>"I" and "you" in the same paragraph both refer to the same entity.
Same paragraph!  Same bold typeface; same everything!  It's fucked
up.</p>

<p>I'm doing errands with janette; we're looking for a phone and I
have faxed to Nova my Certificate of Eligibility to work in Japan!</p>

<p class=date>5:34pm</p>

<p>We're at Target; selected a phone and looked for T-shirts with cool
tags that I can photograph, enlarge, print on the T-shirt itself.
Preferably with color images of apples and shit <em>and</em> symbols
representing washing machines, dryers and irons <em>and</em> multiple
languages.  Oh, and the right size.  Didn't find most of those
requirements all on one side of one tag on one correctly sized
shirt.</p>

Subject: PS: Congratulations on Exam 2; Richard graded it for you.   

When Richard was here in Austin, he helped me add up the points and
enter the grades.  When I got to your name (at the bottom), I said,
"How many points should Rob get?"
&lt;pause>  "Two hundred n' ten."

That was the grading process.

I wonder how long it will be before someone asks me about it.

<p>Yikes I gotta remember to wish Maggie and Molly Happy B-day tomorrow.</p>

<p>Watched <em>The Ring</em> with Josephine between Janette and I on
the bed.  They didn't watch the part where the girl climbs out of the
TV.  I did.  It wasn't nearly as scary as first time I saw it in the
theater.</p>

<p>I was right that they didn't show Noah's fucked up face at that
scene, but I was wrong because they did show it later.</p>

<p>Phat Pat wouldn't watch the movie, but he watched the after movie
outtakes/scary-extra-footage.  Good stuff.</p>

<p>I am tiiiiiiiiii-red</p>

<p>Went for a walk with Colleen and Richard today.  Richard spent $10
on a MGD / Miller Lite round raft for Colleen (actually she paid him
back) and I got a fifty cent picture looking up through a high tension
tower for powerlines.  Free with $10 purchase.  :-P</p>

<p>Janette and I went for a walk to the lake and I showed her where I
jumped and hit the nail with my rib last night.  Also showed her all
the things Joel and I climbed on at the park last night.  Fun
stuff.</p>

<p>Rich showed me a flash animation parody of LoR 2 on <a
href="https://www.newgrounds.com">newgrounds.com</a>  It's called One
Ring to Rule Them All 2 I think.  Silly funny.</p>

<p>Now I'm likely to add some pictures to my website.</p>

<p>Dammit.  Some of these lovely kittens rode my bike today and the
pedal was all loose and instead of .. nevermind.  Anyway, the bolt
that holds the pedal to the crankshaft is now missing.</p>

<p>I've lost plenty of my dad's tools and stuff in my time.</p>

<p>Release, release, release.</p>

<p class=date>12:03pm CST Sunday 16 March 2003</p>

<p>Oh, these guys rule.  Ed and Casey found the bolt.  Awesome.</p>

<p>Well it seems that the reboot after Java was not related to the
problem and it's "just" that I can't send email to Suzanne.  I've been
able to in the past, but not now and I don't see why.</p>

<p>This party has been great.  I put a banana in the freezer. Casey
Jones, Colleen Crotty, Joel Brazzel, Richard Hermerding, Mike Holcomb,
Heather Hall, Tyler Keith, Skyler Nelson, Edward Lerner, Jackie Purdy,
Laura Caddell, Laura Douglas, (her friends Kelly, Yasmine, Gavin),
Lawren Miller, Doc (Dan Owens), Ben Batschelet, have all been here
during the party, oh and Josephine, Jack, Janette, me.</p>

<p>Silent football was fun.  Richard lost.</p>

<p>Janette made an incredible cake!  And spaghetti and other stuff.
Cake was for Colleenie Beanie's birthday.  Big big thanks to Colleen
for driving all the way up from Corpus!</p>

<p>Big fun climbing all over trees in the park.  I didn't fall.  Nor
did Laura, though she did some cool tricky climbing.</p>

<p>Walked to the lake with Mike, Joel, Lawren.  I jumped inside the
white boat house thing, trying to leap 4 feet over water to a 10 inch
strip of concrete, and I basically made it, but had to use the wall
for balance, but I hit the head of a nail and bruised a rib pretty
effectively.  Ouch.</p>

<p>Joel and I climbed all over the toys in the playground, and I
schooled him in climbing (no hands) over the caterpillar thing, and he
"schooled" me by wrenching me out of the swing (he was on the ground,
so the outcome was inevitable)</p>

<p>Past couple of days I've been playing around on <a
href="https://www.geeky-boy.com/cgi-bin/bbs_thingie">bbst</a>, which
Laura, Steve, Gail, TDK have kept intact and now some old Castle of
Dreams people are showing up, triggered by Nim finding me online by
searching for "Thunder Rabbit" Good times; I wonder if I'll stay on
bbst for a while.  I wonder if Janette will find it fun enough to chat
on it.</p>

<p>Josephine and I are going to go driving now.  I wonder if any of
the kittens want to go with us (and if she'll be okay with that).</p>
