<p>Just got back from lunch.  Kristen broke me out of jail (*) for a bit
so we could get a snack at Amy's Ice Cream.  She even fronted me 75
cents for my Tiny sized snack.</p>

<p>We played ten fingers and she won pretty handily (no pun intended)
with four fingers left.</p>

<p>First and last hug before she goes back to DC tomorrow.</p>

<p>(*) jail = work</p>

<p>Kristen came into town Friday and she and her sister Jessica
visited me while galavanting around Houston.  We went to a bookstore
where I purchased Pimsleur's beginning French on tape.  We listened to
that on the way home and laughed a lot, mostly because Kristen already
knows French and taunted the slowness of the tape.  I felt a bit
embarassed (too strong of a word) that I don't know French that well
yet.  That's not even quite it.. something like embarassed to subject
them to the tape when Kristen knew it, and I believe Jessica didn't
care.  whatever.</p>

<p>Anyway, overall it was fun to hang out with them.  We listened to
NIN new album and Tori Amos some, and talked about back when Kristen
and I first met.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the first YRUU meeting I've attended in a while!  The
winter holidays, the Houston Rally, and me being sick all kept me
away.  Before the meeting, I gave away about 20 CDs to Meg, who is
quite more music-listening than I.</p>

<p>During the meeting, we discussed the question of whether or not
youth could successfully police themselves.  Susie brought up the good
points that:</p>

<ul><li><p>YRUU is about youth empowerment (no surprise there)</p></li>

<li><p>The community is what makes YRUU so incredibly awesome</p></li>

<li><p>When youth break the rules without advisors knowing, they are
not "getting away" with something over the advisors.  They are instead
destroying the community.</p></li>

<li><p>The younger youth look up to the older youth for role
modeling.</p></li>

<li><p>Therefore the older youth must police themselves and the
younger youth, otherwise the community is slowly chipped away.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And Tina said this chipping away at the community is like a stack
of Jenga blocks.  Slowly the community will collapse onto itself.</p>

<p>Susie will bring this discussion to the YRUU email list.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>At the end of the meeting, I told Susie about my intention to
graduate from YRUU and teach English in Japan.  She quite encouraged
the idea.</p>

<p>Got sunburned at ultimate tournament yesterday.  We won our first
three games, and then first game in the semi-finals we lost and
therefore no more games for our team. The best part about it for me is
that at this tournament, our players were willing to throw me the
disc.  I wasn't ignored as happened in the league a year ago or so.  I
made a few great catches for points.  One was tipped by someone else
and I bonked onto my shoulder to get it before it hit the ground, and
another was a huge long throw that I slid on my calves to catch.  Good
stuff.</p>

<p>Our team name was Red Sea (because everyone wore red or white for
the recent valentine's holiday) and our team was team C when the
roster was developed.</p>

<p>I got to work early today so I could take a long lunch to see
Beakman live, who is apparently some recently TV-famous fun science
personality who will be performing. I had never heard of him until
Johnny from KTRU scored some cheap tickets (3 bucks!) to see his
show.</p>

<p>I'll be leaving in about an hour.</p>

<p class=date>2:06pm</p>

<p>We arrived late, and it certainly felt weird to me to be escorted
to the fourth row of the Wortham Center, with a show in progress.
Beakman said something like, "You're late!"</p>

<p class=date>Sunday (2 days later)</p>

<p>Um, so it was fun and I got him to sign a short length of the
toilet paper he blew into the audience with a leaf blower.  I
laminated it at Kinko's and will put it in KTRU somewhere.</p>

<p>After work, at which I mostly worked, I visited Jennifer at Paint
This! to take pictures of some cookie jars she painted for advertising
purposes.  I'll email the pics to her tomorrow.</p>

<p>Went home and felt a bit restless - and finally settled onto my bed
with some baby carrots to munch and a can of Dr Pepper that had been
sitting on my counter for a couple months waiting for the perfect
moment to drink.  I read the screenplay of <em>Pulp Fiction</em>,
given to me by Bryn a couple years ago.  Nice relaxing evening.</p>

<p>Wende called me and wanted to eat ice cream so we met at Amy's and
chilled and talked.  I told her of my intention to teach English in
Japan next year.  It all started with Bryn encouraging me to travel
and then me finding <a href="https://www.usexperiment.org">US
Experiment</a>, and deciding that being a leader with them would be a
pretty cool thing, but learning that I don't really have enough
in-country experience, though I have ample kooboodles of youth work
experience.  So I chose not to apply for that, plus I wanted to attend
SWUUSI this year.  I believe I may be graduating myself out of YRUU
advising after this year.</p>

<p>I've got to travel the world.  :-)</p>

<p class=date>10:06pm</p>

<p>good night.</p>

<p>I've actually been working pretty consistently today.  I'm not
clear on what forces motivate me to work on some days and slack on
others.  I certainly focus better on the computer after I take breaks
away from the computer.</p>

<p>Patrick found a data integrity screwup from January.  I changed one
dataset, but didn't change the other dataset to reflect the changes.
He has given me a fairly simple fix, but I will likely calculate the
fix myself and see if we match.</p>

<p>I appreciate that my departure from the company is being slowly
integrated into our thinking.  Today was the third week in a row (I
think) that Karla has mentioned that we are in the process of copying
my knowledge into other brains here at work.</p>

<p>Last night before French class I was really thinking about dropping
the class because French is just so fucking bizarre.  But after class
I realize that it's really not so terribly bad (conjugating verbs in
present tense nearly all sound the same (even if the spelling is
wack)) so maybe I'll be able to stick it out.  Certainly it will help
if I study.</p>

<p>Also need to contact my team in our investment club and actually do
some research sooner than one hour before the next monthly meeting.
That would be good.</p>

<p>Last night at Dude's I spent some time cramming some pictures into
two recent journal entries.  I've still not messed with all the pics
from Houston Rally or the Ohio Con that David and I attended, but all
the pics are chillin' on Dude's computer, waiting patiently.  Oh, and
I have about 90 pics of Shepherd construction that I still intend to
post.  One day.  One day.</p>

<p>I haven't studied Japanese in a couple days, but I'll see Rie (*)
tonight at ASL and I'll learn some more then.  I know about 20
characters now I think.  Well 17 for sure.  I think.</p>

Hi Megan

I don't have a TV, but when I'm at my friend Dude's
(*) house we seem to always be watching TechTV.  Good
thing too, cause I think you are amazingly
beautiful/cute/smiley/awesome.

Dude taunts me by saying, "she lives in Houston, you
know," which is a taunt because we also live in
Houston.

I am completely certain you have five million suitors
since TechTV certainly has a lot of viewers, so I'm
adding my name to the list.

You should go out with me because I'm single and
intend to stay that way, so I won't be a pest or a
leach.  I've been a computer programmer by trade for 5
years, but I'm shifting myself out of my career so I
can go travel around the world, which seems a lot more
real and meaningful than computers.

Instead of more computer languages, I'm learning
spoken languages - Spanish, French, Japanese, and
American Sign Language.

   See ya

since he was 0 years old.

<p>Fabulous day today riding my bike around.  I'm
actually quite tired as a result, and I may not write
a ton about it.</p>

<p>Basically I rode to Hermann Park and waved to peeps
on the little train, then rode further out Fannin to
see the new train tracks for Houston's first mass
transit train in a long long time.  Fun to ride on the
bumpy dirt where the tracks will be soon.</p>

Got an amazing cool picture of the rails all lined
up on Fannin going underneath Holcombe.</p>

<p>The rails have been welded together to be hundreds
of feet long; I wonder what it takes to coordinate
moving them into place??</p>

<p><a href="/images/construction/Houston/light_rail/initial_feb-2002/intersection.jpg"><img src="/images/construction/Houston/light_rail/initial_feb-2002/thumbs/intersection.jpg" align=left></a> I found an 
intersection of dirt at San Jacinto and some other street near the museum and circular fountain at Main St
and Montrose.</p>

intersection looking the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Banged a bruise into my knee on the way home as I
rode quickly through the bumpy dirt on Shepherd.  Got
a couple of pics of it as well.</p>

<p>The weather was perfect 70 degrees and clear blue
sky.  Beautiful.</p>

<p>I'm at KTRU now getting paid to write journal
entries, learn Japanese, broadcast the basketball
game.</p>

<p>I got to see the super cute Jessi who is in the
shift before mine again this semester.  Yay!</p>

<p><a href="/images/construction/rice/base.jpg"><img src="/images/construction/rice/thumbs/base.jpg" align=left></a> Oh, before KTRU, I noticed this
new concrete base looking thing outside the RMC.  I wonder what it will be for.

<p>After KTRU is ultimate frisbee at UH for the first
time in <em>months</em>!</p>
