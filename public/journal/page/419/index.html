<p>After some fucked up news about a semi-girlfriend situation, I was
thrilled to *almost* complete Kim's website!  I've been working on it
for so so long; it was almost perfectly finished when I left Kinko's
to help Sally pick up some chairs that her friends gave her before
they move.</p>

<p>Rode my bike like a <em>fiend</em> down San Joaquin Drive toward
Sally's apartments, barely running the red light at full speed to get
onto San Joaquin, and hauling ass with cars bearing down on me when
they got their green light.</p>

<p>I had to stop at the bottom of the hill (far too much cross traffic
on Jamboree to fuck around with that intersection) for I had no green
light.  One day I may get lucky with the timing, or find a consistency
with it that I can exploit.</p>

<p>Lungs panting/gasping the cool air.  Legs full of adrenaline,
almost shaking, but not.  Paced around in circles like a tiger or a
shark in Shell parking lot until I got a green light.  Traffic thinned
out first, so I went across on red.</p>

<p>Bike upstairs, rested 15 minutes cause my lungs felt... stretched,
maybe.  That's my best guess.  Hopped in Scott with Eminem blasting
away the pissy mood.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Sat in Sally's office without her noticing.  I was there probably 2
or 3 minutes before she turned around.  Big awesome hug.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Got to Sally's friends' and ended up with the chairs in her trunk.
Scott came as backup in case they were too big to fit both chairs in 1
car.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Eminemed back and Sally has ssh on her computer, so I *finished*
Kim's project!  I emailed him all "wazzzaaaaaaaahhpppp" to let him
know the shit is finished.</p>

<p>And now Sally is making shishkabobs and I made some chocolate chip
cookies with no brown sugar.  Awwww yeah.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>On a road trip, I went back to Bloomington, staying in
a garage apartment at the same address as Maggie and Molly's house.  I
felt all sad like, "what am I doing here?" and was crying when I came
from the store where Barb was working, but when I opened the door,
some other traveler was in the room as well.</p>

<p class=dream>"When did you get here?"</p>

<p class=dream>"Not so long ago."  She had a guitar on the floor
beside her.</p>

<p class=dream>"I felt like I don't know what the hell I'm doing here,
that's why I was crying."</p>

<p class=dream>"Me too."</p>

<p class=dream>"Girl, give me a hug."</p>

<p class=dream>And we hugged, knowing the angst and trauma the other
may be experiencing.  So great to find a fellow traveler.</p>

<p>Much better this morning.  It was frustrating yesterday because I
couldn't see the actual error message to help direct my debugging
search.  Had to use a bunch of print() statements and an exit() to
debug the thing.</p>

<p>This morning I got past the bulk of the errors, basically they were
all file paths not being correct.</p>

<p>FTPd to his server, if I go pwd, I get /web/whatever/.  But
<em>actually</em> the path is like /users/site120/cks/web/whatever/.
Silly FTP configuration.</p>

<p>I used a perl script to figure out what the path was.</p>

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
print "&lt;html> &lt;head>\n";
print "&lt;title>CGI Environment&lt;/title>\n";
print "&lt;/head>\n";
print "&lt;body>\n";
print "&lt;h1>CGI Environment&lt;/h1>\n";
foreach $env_var (keys %ENV) {
   print "&lt;B>$env_var&lt;/B> = $ENV{$env_var}&lt;BR>\n";
}
print "&lt;/body> &lt;/html>\n";

<p>Sally and I went to Santa Monica to skate today.</p>

<p>Utterly beautiful and incredible.</p>

<p>Cool things</p>

<p>Wait, uncool thing first:</p>

<p>Watched a guy catch a stingray and not let it go.  (That was out on
the pier.)</p>

<p>Cool things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Going out on the pier wearing skates even though signage
clearly prohibited skates.  Saw an old woman wearing skates at the far
end of the pier.  Watched waves crash below us.</p></li>

<li><p>Sally's front wheel coming off her skate, and me having
replacement parts for it in Scott.</p></li>

<li><p>Skating from Venice Pier to Santa Monica Pier along the
beachfront bike path thing.  Sally getting faster and more confident
in her skating abilities.</p></li>

<li><p>Trying to leap from section to section of the curb with light
poles in the way.</p></li>

<li><p>Finding a playground with gymnastic jungle gym equipment!
Parallel bars, uneven bars, balance beam, high bars, rings, ropes, and
other things to climb on, swing from, fall off.</p></li>

<li><p>Climbing, swinging, enjoying all this equipment without
falling.</p></li>

<li><p>Enjoying the sunset while standing in the surf.</p></li>

<li><p>Pictures of college students being funny on the swings instead
of studying for finals.</p></li>

<li><p>Pictures of skaters filming kick flips over a 4x4 foot square
hole in the concrete.</p></li>

<li><p>Buying some sage for Sally from a cat who buys and sells drums
from Ghana.</p></li>

<li><p>Skating on a curved curb thing.</p></li>

<li><p>Chillin' in Scott, listening to some of Sally's childhood
stories, and how they affect her modern life.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Got back from Santa Monica at 8pm, and Rick came over for grilled
burgers (Morning Star veggie burgers for me) and chillin'</p>

<p>Sally and I watched <em>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</em>.  I
hadn't previously seen it.  My favorite scene is when the princess
reveals herself to be Invincible Sword Princess or something.
Nice.</p>

<p>Sally and I bicycled around the main big loop of Peter's Canyon.
Up and down big hills with 10mph speed limit signs at the top,
indicating the max speed one should allow on the way down.</p>

<p>I didn't make it up one of the hills without getting off my bike,
but I was able to restart and almost make it all the way up.</p>

<p>Sally saw a fox.  I didn't see it.</p>

<p>A bit tired after going around once.  I could go around again,
but I would be pretty darn tired, plus we haven't eaten yet today.</p>

<p>I've never seen a Woody Allen movie before.  I appreciate how he
strings scenes together, not hiding that they throw a lot onto the
cutting room floor, keeping the best for us.</p>

<p>Some of the scenes were just hilarious - Cookie, his best friend,
his son, all going to the honoring ceremony.. then his friend dying
without a sound.  Therapist bitching him out while she's got a patient
on the couch.  "You can't scare me like that!  I grind my teeth.."</p>

<p>Ate at Felix's in Orange, California with Sally.  Sat outside side
by side under a heater thing, facing the traffic circle, the interior
of which featured a decorated christmas tree, palm trees, magnolia
tree, and tall pine trees.</p>

<p>We laughed a lot.</p>

<p>A woman in a Subaru pulled up, waited around a bit, got some coffee
at Diedrich's then left.  Sally said that my next car would be a
Subaru cause it's so practical and is four wheel drive.</p>

<p>I was like, "actually, I'm going to get a gas/electric hybrid."</p>

<p>Around that time a white truck drove around the circle with its
system bumping.</p>

<p>"Sometimes I wanna get a system like that for Scott."</p>

<p>"You can.."</p>

<p>"Naw man, I'm not going to drop a thousand dollars on that.."</p>

<p>"You can at least just get an upgrade for a couple hundred."</p>

<p>Interesting point.  "I'll get a system in my hybrid car.  Ita be
all bumping around the street, jumping from lane to lane cause the
bass is so big.  I'll get me some twenty fo, no make it thirty six
inch speakers.  Can you imagine.." I held my hands out at three foot
diameter, "speakers this big.  Hafta be made out of wood, or
metal... piece of glass, or plastic.  sumpin like that."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>One of the waitstaff came up to us and asked in espanol, "did you
just win the lottery?"</p>

<p>I didn't understand him and could only pick out lottery and was
all, "lottery?"</p>

<p>Sally understood, said no we didn't.</p>

<h1>virus download complete</h1>

<p>We went to <a
href="https://www.oldtowneorange.net/happytimeantiquesmall.htm">Happy
Time Antiques Mall</a>, just 90 degrees clockwise around the circle
from Felix's and Sally looked for a ring for herself and a pin for her
mom.  I wandered around the store, found an old brass/copper fire
extinguisher like the one I gave to Maggie some years ago.</p>

<p>Chatted with Pat, the owner and told her about my website and about
my Japan plan.  "I'm not going to get a virus from your website will
I?"</p>

<p>"It's just text.  You'll be fine."</p>

<p>"I've gotten a virus twice now..."</p>

<p>"You will not get a virus by visiting my website."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>On our way out, Pat and I were talking about my intended trek to
Japan.  She was amazing!  And by amazing, I mean the only person who
has reproved my intended adventure with such zest and gusto as if she
had been locked in a Japanese prison for years.  Okay, not that bad,
but damn..</p>

<p>"Have you spoken with someone who has actually worked for Nova?"</p>

<p>"No - only the recruiters who I've met."</p>

<p>"You've <em>got</em> to talk to someone.  Are you going to have
enough money to live?  to eat?  will you have electricity?"</p>

<p>"Either they are completely lying, or I will "  she cut me off
before I could say "be quite fine."</p>

<p>"I'm not saying they're lying; I'm just telling you what I know."</p>

<p>I thought, <em>you've never been!!</em>, for she had already told
us she had not been and had no intention of ever going.</p>

<p>"I can do anything for a year."</p>

<p>"No, you can't."</p>

<p>I was amazed by all the fear she seemed to have of my trusting
attitude of just going.</p>

<p>"Have you heard the horror stories?"</p>

<p>I'm thinking, <em>Stephen King?  yeah.</em>  "ummmm"</p>

<p>"I'll say 'I told you so!'... "</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>I was basically in astonished shock, just laughing my ass off at
how nutty her soothsaying seemed, compared to all the other stories
I've heard.</p>

<p>"Do you know how much a steak or egg costs in Japan?"</p>

<p>I don't know, but replied, "good thing I don't eat steak."</p>

<p>"But you see my point..."</p>

<p>"I'm quite unlikely to talk to someone [who has worked for Nova]
before I go.  I hear what you're saying, and I'll be fine."</p>

<p>Sally tried to come to my rescue, saying I was pretty resourceful
or something.</p>

<p>"Are your parents wealthy enough to bail you out?"</p>

<p>snort.  "no.."</p>

<p>So funny!!</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Outside, we were like, "oh my god!" and basically making fun of
her, just in shock that, just that...  man!</p>

<p>Once we had gone another 90 degrees around the circle, I was all,
"YOU'VE NEVER BEEN!!!" just releasing all the pressure that built up
during that single conversation.</p>

<p>Wild.</p>

<p>So, Pat, I'm likely to go in March.  Check back here in April or
June and see how I'm doing.</p>

<p>Oh, and just kidding about the virus message above.</p>

<p>Went swimming.  Started in the hot tub cause the pool would
certainly be too freezing.</p>

<p>"Too hot for the hottub!  yeow!!"</p>

<p>Once we got too hot for the hot tub, we visited the pool, which
felt surprisingly not too hot.  Sat on the rope and held on with my
toes as Sally tried to shake it to knock me off.  Too tight for the
tight rope!</p>

<p>Saw a U shaped piece of plant hopefully, that when I pulled it out
of the pool, looked a lot like a rat tail.  Totally gross, but hey
chlorine should keep us safe, right?</p>

<p>Got cold after a while and went back to the hot tub.</p>

<p>After the other people left the hot tub, we made a whirlpool out of
it.  Fun.</p>

<p>Freestyled a song about "snot's not a loogey," which was quite
funny and quite good, if one likes songs about snot and loogeys.</p>

<p>Back up to Sally's apartment, cleaned up, ate, watched
<em>Deconstructing Harry</em>.</p>
