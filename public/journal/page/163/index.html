<p>I went from my lesson in Harajuku, walked to the toy store where I
stop by every week to play with their puzzles, walked past a Japanese
garden, down 竹下 shopping street with lots of people, took the train to
Ebisu station, walked to my office, helped them with a problem on
website, back to the train in Ebisu, went to Shinagawa, then changed
to other line went to Kawasaki, then walked down the night club street
and talked to a few people then walked the rest of the way home&hellip; all
barefoot!</p>

<p>Bah the CB website is acting up.  I happen to have been in Harajuku so
I&rsquo;m heading in to the office now.</p>

<h2 id="21-25-tuesday-29-december-2015-jst">21:25 Tuesday 29 December 2015 JST</h2>

<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know what caused the problem, but everything seems to be
working again.  It happened last night for a few hours and again
tonight for a few hours, so I guessed it was simply being overloaded
by traffic, but Google analytics says it&rsquo;s not particularly swamped
right now.</p>

<p>Alfonzo assumed it was an expired SSL cert, but that doesn&rsquo;t seem to
be it either, because that wouldn&rsquo;t cause problems every 24 hours.</p>

<p>But the good news: I now have the .pem to log in to the server so I
can better troubleshoot things and blah blah.</p>

<p>Satomi uploaded the final image(s) they needed to upload before the
end of the year and we walked to the station together after closing up
the office.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re kinda planning to have a take-a-party at her place to try and
fix her old iMac, which might just need a new hard drive..</p>

<p>Okay so when I got back from OZ, upon arrival in Narita, I was
approached by a TV crew who asked why I was barefoot and why I was
coming to Japan.</p>

<p>I wish I had just been honest, but I told them what I <em>wished</em> I was
doing: traveling barefoot around the country for 3+ months.  They were
like, &ldquo;wow so can we follow you around?&rdquo; I was caught in my lie!  I
would <em>LOVE</em> for you to come follow me around Japan, if only I were
going to travel around Japan!</p>

<p>Dammit, so I kept the lie going, &ldquo;um, no, um because it&rsquo;s difficult um
because if I&rsquo;m on camera I might not act natural.&rdquo;  (true, see? here
I am lying because of the camera)</p>

<p>They said okay and asked if they could see the bottom of my feet.  No
worries.</p>

<p>Okay, so bye!  and I walked away, assuming the camera was watching me,
I didn&rsquo;t look back until I got out of sight.</p>

<p>Okay, so they got their footage (hehe), but now I gotta go confess.  I
went back up the escalator and found them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah, um, so I lied because I thought it would sound good on TV.  I
actually live in Japan and have lived here for 12 years, but yes, I
often go around barefoot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I started composing a reply, but before I could get to an internet connection, he wrote again:</p>

<pre><code>Sorry for mailing you again.  In the airing, we keep the fact that
you live in Japan secret until the end of the airing.  (&quot;the end
of the airing&quot; means &quot;the scene you come back to our clew to
explain your living in Japan&quot;) So, the picture should be taken in
the U.S or, if taken in Japan, the background of the pictures is
not Japanese like.  Do you have pics like that??
</code></pre>

<p>I replied naively</p>

<pre><code>Hmmm; I might have some, but I'm not sure.  My wife and I are
going to the US in late January, so I can take those types of
pictures in the US and send them to you by February 1.

I'd be happy to do another interview on camera, or even have your
camera crew with me for a day in my actual normal life.  We could
go somewhere fun like Yomiuri Land, or Korakuen.. or somewhere
normal like Yoyogi Park or Meiji Jingu.

As a start, we could simply go to a shrine for New Year's Eve this
coming Thursday night if you like.

You can interview my wife about my bare feet as well.
</code></pre>

<p>And he replied as follows.  (Of course they already have plans for new years!)</p>

<pre><code>Thank you so much for your reply.  The airing will be Jan. 25th,
and I'm glad if you send them before the date of airing.  So, the
picture is to be taken in Japan if you don't have one taken in the
U.S.  I think pictures of you in Yoyogi park or somewhere in the
street can be either way to be taken in U.S or Japan.  (Like you
sitting on the bench, or walking on the street)

As for another filming, it could be true if we meet up in the
airport again.  In the New Year's Eve, we are going to Comic
market and film OTAKU foreigners.  So, please wait until next
year.

<p>This is the second statement for us to ponder, after &ldquo;Language is like
cake.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="anyone-who-speaks-the-language-can-teach-the-language">Anyone who speaks the language can teach the language</h3>

<p>(I cropped from the final version the indented crap in the middle)</p>

<p>I apparently taught my brother how to count, just through repetition.
This was at an age early enough that I don&rsquo;t remember it.  Animals
learn through repetition; we learn through repetition.  Repetition
accounts for many types of learning, but is the teacher actually
teaching? Is a lioness teaching when she hunts?  I dunno, but her prey
better learn quickly or risk failing the pop quiz.  This kind of
learning really comes down to the learner, not the teacher.</p>

<p>This is the essential difference between learning a native language
and learning a second language.  Bootstrapping the native language out
of nothing comes from sheer repetition, while learning a second
language uses the first language as a framework for the concepts of
communication.</p>

<p>In some cases, the similarity of the native language framework means
the second language will come rather easily.  It&rsquo;s no secret that
Romance languages are similar.  It&rsquo;s probably relatively easy to find
people who can teach between these languages.</p>

<pre><code>Italian, French, Spanish Just look at the similarities here
https://ielanguages.com/romance_phrases.html

In my case, I've basically given up learning Japanese; the grammar is
backwards, the writing is insane, and a great amount of cultural
knowledge is required just to figure out what's going on.

My American English framework (and sheer laziness) are a poor starting
place for learning Japanese.

Hmm I seem to have veered off topic.

So the mythical magical teacher who can lead a horse to water *and*
make him drink is darn near impossible to find.
</code></pre>

<p>But what about languages which are quite different? R.L.G. says
&ldquo;languages farther from your own in the linguistic family tree will be
harder for you to learn.&rdquo; (1) Therefore, I posit the art of presenting
a target language to native speakers of a dissimilar language in a way
that it can fit within the student&rsquo;s existing language framework <em>and</em>
remain interesting enough to keep the student motivated must surely be
honed over years of practice!</p>

<p>Lin and I are on 南武線 headed to 登戸駅 where we&rsquo;ll change to
小田急線 and go to 鶴川駅 for a nice little walk to the house!</p>

<p>登戸駅 is next!</p>

<h2 id="13-22">13:22</h2>

<p>We barely missed the local train, but we caught up to it in 新百合ケ丘
by taking the express train.  The local train has been passed by two
express trains now, which means that&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;d have to
enjoy/endure/consider if we moved to 百合ヶ丘, at which (according to
Lin) only local trains stop.</p>

<h2 id="15-42">15:42</h2>

<p>I reallly really really like the house, its location, etc.  We
selected runes:</p>

<p>Overview:</p>

<p>dagaz</p>

<p>berkana reversed   (appropriate action)</p>

<p>Dagaz is like breakthrough and berkana is like &ldquo;make sure you think of
others (ママ) as well, ね？</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a bit of a hill, but overall it&rsquo;s closer to the station than
we are now, I think the hill will be a bit of a challenge for Lin&rsquo;s
mom at first, but that it would reallllly help her get fit and trim,
which I judge will help her be more healthy overall.</p>

<p>Right now I enter tags comma separated on a single line.  They are
written as typed in the &hellip; whatsitcalled (frontmatter?).. the text at
the top of each file, which in the case of this file, looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>---
title: Finally figured out how I want tags to be entered
</code></pre>

<p>tags: [ &ldquo;journal&rdquo;, &ldquo;tags&rdquo; ]
    author: Rob Nugen
    date: 2015-12-27T12:45:54+09:00
    &mdash;</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a problem with this inasmuch as it doesn&rsquo;t conform to the
standard for writing tags, which would be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>---
title: Finally figured out how I want tags to be entered
tags:
   journal
   tags
author: Rob Nugen
date: 2015-12-27T12:45:54+09:00
---
</code></pre>

<p>That may not be it either, but the YAML(?) standard is some variety of
having each tag separated by things including a newline, instead of a
comma.  That way it&rsquo;s easier to include commas and spaces in tags.</p>

<p>So anyway, each time I create a journal entry (in lovely Emacs, whose
macros I haven&rsquo;t translated for use in Sublimetext 2), I type <code>C-c j</code>
and enter the title, tags, year, month, day at separate prompts.  The
date fields are given defaults of today&rsquo;s date.  For dreams (<code>C-c d</code>),
the title and tags are pre-populated to &lsquo;Dream&rsquo; and &lsquo;dream&rsquo;
respectively.  (And for Japanese entries (remember those??) (<code>C-c n</code>),
the title and tags have defaults as well.)</p>

<p>Anyway, anyway, instead of entering a comma separated list of tags, I
want to end each tag with a carriage return as I enter them; the
prompts will keep asking for them as long as something is entered.</p>

<p>Some kind of recursive thing&hellip; if only LISP could do recursion!
(haha)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m writing this without net access, or I&rsquo;d try to look it up now.
Something like

<p>I just signed up for a TESOL course so I can fulfill my dream..  of being&hellip;
an English .. teacher .</p>

<p>wait a minute!  I&rsquo;m already teaching.  haha</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m actually taking it because the syllabus looked pretty likely to
teach me some things I don&rsquo;t know yet, and it will probably help me be
a mo&rsquo; betta&rsquo; teacha&rsquo;, and i tmight just help me learn some skizzles /
give some inspiration to learn a little Japanese.  Plus the price
seemed reasonable.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll likely post my video submissions on my journal as well.  Dunno
about that yet, though.</p>

<p>On the way home we saw a soft drink machine next to an alcohol machine
which offered beer and two types of liquor.</p>
