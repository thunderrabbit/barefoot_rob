<p><p>I could easily tell a storm is coming, but Wende called to say it
includes hail.  I&rsquo;m moving her truck inside the garage now.  I&rsquo;ll have
to clear some space!</p>

<p><p class=date>7:14pm</p>

<p><p>I just moved it in.  The rain is only barely sprinkling, but the
lightning is quite frequent and threatening.  I&rsquo;m writing using power
protected by the UPS!!!  HAhahahahaaa!!!</p>

<p><p>Moving the crap out of the way proved not too difficult, but
certainly we have more crap in the garage than we need.</p>

<p><p class=date>7:16pm</p>

<p><p>The power just blinked!  Actually the UPS clicked a couple times
before the lights dimmed; it detected the voltage wackiness before the
voltage significantly dropped.  Lightning flashes closer and closer..
I can see the rain is picking up intensity.</p>

<p><p>Tonight is ultimate night if this storm passes within 1 hour.  It&rsquo;s
quite likely to come and go in that timeframe; the clouds seem thick
but energetic enough to move themselves past.</p>

<p><p class=date>7:21pm</p>

<p><p>I just exited the X Window system.  Though I&rsquo;m bragadocious about
my UPS, it seems safer this way.  If the power does go, I want fewer
processes running on my machine.</p>

<p><p>The garbage truck just came by picking up cans with its claw thing
and tossing them into its maw.  Two weeks ago, the truck came by at
7am.  Hmm.</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>Work was good today; I got my annual review with happy colors from
Kevin and Karla.  I think I got a 15% raise.</p>

<p><p class=date>7:32pm</p>

<p><p>The lightning seems to be above and past our house now.  The rain
is falling quite heavily.  I&rsquo;m not so sure anymore that it will be
done in 1 hour.  I think I&rsquo;ll read some more bible.</p>

                        <p><title>Biblical commentary</title>
<p class=date>11:56pm CDT Monday 16 October 2000</p>

<p><p>So I was just reading Wende&rsquo;s NIV Student Bible.  This is
essentially my first time ever to read <em>the bible</em> at all.
Ever.  I started with Genesis.</p>

<p><p>Questions as I remember them (I didn&rsquo;t take notes)</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Where did Cain's wife come from?

<p><li>Why did God get so mad so quickly?

<p><li>Why didn't god like Cain's gift?

<p><li>How did a flood kill all the fish?

<p><li>How did an olive branch grow so quickly after the flood?
</ul>

<p><p>Mostly I&rsquo;m anti impressed with how angry god became so quickly.
I&rsquo;ve heard that God is more spiteful in the Old Testament, and now I&rsquo;m
reading that for myself.</p>

<p><p>See, here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m thinking:</p>

<p><p>Adam and Eve were in the Garden of Eden.  Fine.  God said don&rsquo;t eat
from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.  (Oh, that reminds me
that just previously in the chapter (in the actual creation part) God
apparently said man could eat of any of the trees.)  Fine.</p>

<p><p>So Eve ate the apple.  Adam ate the apple.  (I&rsquo;m skipping all the
ridiculous <em>blame</em> part (&ldquo;she made me do it!&rdquo;  &ldquo;the snake made me do
it!&ldquo;))  They ate the apple.  Fine.  Now suddenly God is pissed and
said forever your lives will suck because you have made one error.</p>

<p><p>Think about this for a second.  There has been one entity that told
them what to do.  Parents tell their kids what to do and kids don&rsquo;t do
it.  Kids forget, they test their boundaries, kids explore for
themselves.  How was it any different for Adam and Eve (kids) and God
(parent)??  It wasn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p><p>Don&rsquo;t say, &ldquo;but they disobeyed <em>God</em>.  They had no frame of
reference.  Here&rsquo;s an example frame of reference: I can yell at a guy
in the street and probably nothing will happen.  I can yell at a cop
in the street and probably get a line of questioning or worse.  I can
yell at the President and have Secret Service on my ass in two seconds
flat.  I can yell at the King of England in 16th century and lose my
head over it.</p>

<p><p>See - there&rsquo;s a heirarchy.  Adam and Eve didn&rsquo;t have that.  They
just had one level.  So for god to pull out the big arsenal and say
&ldquo;gonna make you sweat&rdquo; etc was just a big jerk thing to do.</p>

<p class=date>9:41pm CDT Monday 16 October 2000</p>

<p><p>Yay!!!  We just lost power in the house, but my computer stayed on
no sweat!!!  Wheeee!!  The power was only off for about 45 seconds,
and that certainly used to bug me when I&rsquo;d have to run upstairs and
turn off the computer just when a little storm blew through.</p>

<p><p>I have recently decided to get a PhD in Philosophy.  I just decided
this tonight after it&rsquo;s been brewing in my head for a while.  Maybe I
should start with some undergraduated philosophy classes.  Wende has a
book <em>Classics of Western Philosophy</em>; before I read it I&rsquo;ll
philosophize my own rantings here online..  Write a State of my
Philosophical Mind Address.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ll start outlining it.</p>

<p><p><pre>
reality<br />
   are we watched<br />
       information storage</p>

<p>are we judged</p>

<p>nature of the universe<br />

      too big to waste</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m tired.</p>

<p><p>Spun some discs at KTRU after eating dinner with Molly, Will and
Wende.  They listened to most of my show and called in a couple times.
I played &ldquo;The Presidents&rdquo; by Animaniacs for Molly.  Wende picked me up
after KTRU and then I went out to play ultimate.  Meek, Will, Mike,
Nguyen and I showed up, but most everyone else was playing at a
tournament in College Station.  Instead of ultimate, we played disc
golf.</p>

<p><p>Just Meek, Will and I played; Mike and Nguyen chose not to.  We
played the time honored disc golf holes.  Had a lot of fun.  Meek got
a 90, I got 81.  Will lost count and Meek declared Will got 82, which
makes me the winner!  I&rsquo;m sure Will actually had fewer throws than I.</p>

<p><p>After disc golf, I came home to try installing Win 95 on Wende&rsquo;s
computer from compact disc.  I don&rsquo;t have the correct OEM code
though.  I got codes from Phrozen Crew&rsquo;s Oscar, but none of them
worked.  Bluh.</p>

<p><p>Bedtime now.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Wende and I were living temporarily in a big house and
my dad and his girlfriend lived upstairs.  Somehow, either Wende or I
had done something that called flying demons toward the house.  We
never saw them, but we knew they were on their way and would be there
that night.  It was a scary feeling of inability to protect ourselves
from these bad entities.  We locked the windows, turned off the lights
and moved our bed stuff upstairs toward the center of the house, so my
dad would be a barrier between us and the bad guys.  I spent a
significant moment figuring out how to lock the window; the lock was
primitive, but enoug to keep out these mindless evil entities.  I had
the sense that they could fly and were like the bad flying monkeys in
Wizard of Oz.</p>

<p><p>When I woke up, my first thoughts were &ldquo;wow; we made it through the
night!&rdquo; and &ldquo;wait, maybe it&rsquo;s <em>tonight</em> that they&rsquo;re supposed
to arrive.&rdquo;  then &ldquo;oh, it was all a dream.  Nevermind.&rdquo;</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>Walking around in a fenced in area, like a large yard -
walking with Wende and my brother Fred maybe, we were being escorted
by a bear acting like a human - walking upright and talking to us.
The bear lived here and had been here for many years.  As we walked,
he would scoop up piles of dog manure and toss them over the fence.
Also little bits of trash he would scoop up and throw over the fence.
We offered to invite him with us to Dallas but he declined,
essentially since he would have to see so many people that he might
never leave Dallas.</p>

<p><p class=dream>We left his house and Monner gave me a photocopy of an
email that someone had written her, thanking (informing) her for my
great email I had sent some time ago.  My feedback was informative - I
encouraged her to visit an online action for the plane tickets to
Australia.  She did that and got good results.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I examined the email carefully and could see where Fred
and I had apparently composed the email together and had written like
&ldquo;This email written by Rob and Fred&rdquo; at the top and then Fred wrote
&ldquo;&lt;- who smokes&rdquo; by my name and I wrote something equally witty by his
name which effectively negated what he had written by my name.</p>

<p><p class=dream>The scene switched and I was leaving a concert or show
and wasn&rsquo;t sure which way to go.  But since I was on Galveston Island,
I surmised that if I went straight one direction, I would eventually
reach a road or something.  Riding my bike along the ocean like on a
sand sidewalk I was riding somewhat behind a guy, but not with him..
we were each on our separate way home.  We just happened to be going
the same direction.  The sidewalk sand area began to get more puddly
and I watched as I splashed through the water and it (salt water) got
on my bicycle chain and sprocket and tires.</p>

<p><p class=dream>The area as we were riding was becoming more
constructed - there was a small building type thing and the sidewalk
was now covered in a metal grate which allowed us more traction.  We
got to a natural water barrier and there appeared to be a fence
surrounding us, as if we had ridden into a fenced in area.  The paved
highway was just on the other side of the fence and we might be in
trouble as they may assume we had trespassed by jumping from the
highway into their fenced in area.  But it was the other way around -
we just rode in and were trying to get out.  I wondered if the bicycle
tracks would still be visible to prove that we had ridden in.</p>

<p><p>It didn&rsquo;t matter; I woke up.</p>

<p><p>References:</p>

<p><p>Wende and I are going to Austin, and I felt obligated to contact
all our friends who live there.</p>

<p><p>Wende and I are researching prices to fly to Australia; maybe we
can find tickets at an online auction!</p>

<p><p>My throat is sore and I need to gargle some salt water.</p>

<p class=date>8:07pm CDT Friday 13 October 2000</p>

<p><p>I just learned that I did not make the Continental Advisor
Training.  I feel partly sad, partly angry, but mostly sad.  I&rsquo;m just
like, tsk  sigh..  nothing to be done about it.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m trusting that all is for the best and stuff, but I certainly
had my hopes up.  I wonder why I didn&rsquo;t make it.  Who did make it?  I
have heard from 4 of my youth that they made it.  That is so awesome
for them!  I haven&rsquo;t heard of any advisors who did.  Pbbbblt.  I know
well a couple of people who were in the group/meeting where the
decision was made.  I also know that they are sworn to secrecy about
anything that was said at the meeting.  Right now I want to ask them,
but maybe I&rsquo;ll lose that urge by the time I see either of them.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>My dad called asking if I had heard from my brother Fred.  Actually
I haven&rsquo;t.  I emailed him a few days ago, but didn&rsquo;t get a response.
Dad called his roommate who said they could get a message to him, but
didn&rsquo;t expect to see him anytime soon.  Hmmm.  I hope he is well.</p>

<p class=date>10:46pm CDT Thursday 12 October 2000</p>

<p><p>Wende and I watched <em>The Next Best Thing</em> tonight, starring
Madonna and a couple of other actors.  I thought it was pretty good
and presented some good controversial issues.  Wende just didn&rsquo;t like
it, saying it wasn&rsquo;t funny and it just showed family not getting
along.  True.</p>

<p><p>Elizabeth and Hillary are Youth Advisor Trainers!  Elizabeth called
enthusiastic with the news.  I haven&rsquo;t heard back from the Youth
Office.  I bet they just didn&rsquo;t get around to calling me yet.  :-)</p>

<p><p class=dream>With Wende at Container Store, just hanging out..  We
had been there for <em>hours</em> and I was really bored.  I expressed
my feelings of &ldquo;ugh; can we just <em>leave</em>?&rdquo; and we fought a
bit.  She said, &ldquo;there are times that I&rsquo;m at your work for this long,&rdquo;
and I was all, &ldquo;and you complain just as much as I am now.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>We left and said Bye to everyone and then arrived in a
gymnasium where administrators of University of Houston were
interviewing people to see how they choose which university to
attend.</p>

<p><p class=dream>The student was saying that he chooses the best
football team and goes to that school.</p>

<p><p>This dream results I think from the situation at Rice, where the
student DJs are feeling pressure from the administration to change the
radio station to broadcast more university interests.</p>

<p><p>Thankfully, it wasn&rsquo;t as cold tonight as it had been on previous
nights.  We had a small group - 8 regulars and a guy named William,
&ldquo;but you can call me Shorty.&rdquo;  Shorty played really well for his age.
Heck, he played better than some of us!</p>

<p><p>We all played well I believe.  I&rsquo;m glad we played even though it
was mostly 4 on 4.  I had more great catches than great throws I
think.</p>

<p><p>But the best play of all began with some short fast passes that
worked the disc all the way to the endzone where it was thrown to Mark
right on the line just as I was running into the goal and Mark tipped
it into my hands.</p>

<p><p>The intentional run-on sentence above shows how fast that play was.</p>
