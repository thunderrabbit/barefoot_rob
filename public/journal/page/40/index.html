<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I woke up with a YRUU dream in my mind.</p>

<p class="dream">
We were somewhere and someone sang some made up lyrics
There was a new  attendee from Colorado, and we jokingly said we had
not heard of their football team, the California Nuggets.  As an
apology, someone sang
</p>

<p class="dream">
Oh my darling, oh my darling<br>
Oh my darling, Clementine<br>
We don't know the football team name<br>
but we remember you just fine.<br>
</p>

<p class="dream">
And everyone cheered.  I proposed we do an impromptu talent show with
a continuous stream of such made up lyrics.
</p>

<p><p class="dream">
We went down to the stage, but it was roped off for cleaning. I asked
the person if we could use it, but was denied.  We would have to come
back in 30 minutes.  So we all lined up and started a freestyle dance
while in line when
</p>
my alarm woke me up.</p>

a bird.</p>

<p>やばい。   yabai</p>

<p>鳥は生きてたしまだ飛べましたから大丈夫みたいです。  The bird seemed
fine and could even fly so I think he is okay.</p>

<p>Tシャツで<ruby><rb>包</rb><rt>くる</rt></ruby>んでゆっくり外に出しました。　I covered him with a
T-shirt then let him outside slowly.</p>

<p class="dream">
I used my deodorant stone incorrectly and it just started melting
before my eyes.  I thought, well, at least I got more than the
advertised year of use out of it.
</p>

<p class="dream">
Riding in an apparently-self-driving car, I sure who was driving it.
There were no people in the front seats.  It was being controlled by
someone who could see from above, like playing a 2D video game.

<p>Jennie caught a dove soon after I let her outside at 4am this
morning.  Fortunately it was uninjured.  After kicking her out of the
room, and slow chasing it around the room for a bit, I got the idea to
drop a cotton T-shirt on the bird.  He chilled out and then actually
did not instantly fly away when he was able to.</p>

<p>He stood on the balcony for about half a minute (30 seconds, not half
of one of these newly defined minutes) and then flew away.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really happy he could fly.</p>

<p>Tonight in Noborito station, I got off the train to try to figure out
which train would be fastest to my station. A woman saw me barefoot
and asked where I was going. She kindly looked up my station and
confirmed my hunch that the next train was fastest to Shin Yurigaoka.</p>

<p>While riding on the train together, she asked me why I was barefoot,
and then what I was doing in Japan.  I talked about my dream to reduce
the suicide rate in Japan, and she reflected on the gravity of the
situation.  She asked me what I thought it was the reason the Japanese
commit suicide, and I said is because I think some people are unable
to talk about serious topics and they end up feeling alone, with no
other way to solve whatever problem they are having.</p>

<p>The conversation was relatively short and sweet; it&rsquo;s only about 8
minutes to my stop.  When getting off the train, I had an urge to
offer a hug so I did, and she accepted.</p>

<p>It was a nice connection, and I wish I had had my business cards or
was thinking quickly enough to trade contact information.  Maybe this
entry will suffice.</p>

<p>Added about 3 seconds worth of frames, so about 36 frames today.
Pretty good!  One of the snakes has finished his first task and is now
snaking around to meet up with his friend who will soon be able to
snake around.  Not sure if I will have them leave&hellip; oh, maybe they
should curl up and wait somewhere.</p>

<p>Pinky fell off the stage and hit the switch, so the stage is rotating
again.  This helped me glue the upper rail along the medium|small
marble split.  It&rsquo;s drying now.</p>

geocache and hid it.</p>

<p><a href="https://geocaching.com">https://geocaching.com</a>で登録したけど、まだハンネイしていない。I
registered it on <a href="https://geocaching.com">https://geocaching.com</a>, but it hasn&rsquo;t been published

<p>No SOGO today due to rain.</p>

<p>I hope Mark got the message; I met him on the train yesterday and
invited him to join.</p>

<p>So what to do today?</p>

<p>Plan:</p>

<ol>
<li>write in Japanese</li>
<li>work on MT3</li>
<li>fix <a href="https://robnugen.com/geocaching">https://robnugen.com/geocaching</a> to refresh to <a href="https://new.robnugen.com/geocaching">https://new.robnugen.com/geocaching</a></li>

<p>I <del>plan to</del> place<ins>d</ins> my first geocache today.</p>

<p>I got support from
<a href="https://www.geocaching.com/p/default.aspx?guid=fdfa20d1-f3e5-4316-beb1-69d1cebbaa3f">Turbo-7</a>,
who sent me links to
<a href="https://www.geocaching.com/play/hide/en-us/small-note">English</a> and
<a href="https://www.geocaching.com/play/hide/ja-jp/small-note">Japanese</a>
notes to place on the cache.</p>

<p>I tweaked the notes to include my email address, but have not put them
online yet because they break the CSS of my site when displayed in the
index, and I cannot figure out how to override the Hugo index the way
I want.</p>

<p><del>I plan to create a (repo with a) page for (each of) my geocache(s),
and am working on that now.</del></p>

<p><del>I plan for it to be available at <a href="https://robnugen.com/geocaching/xxxx">https://robnugen.com/geocaching/xxxx</a>
where xxxx is the code given to me by Geocaching website once I place
the cache.</del>  For now, my domain is prefixed with new, so it will likely
be at <a href="https://new.robnugen.com/geocaching/">https://new.robnugen.com/geocaching/</a> and then the code.</p>
