<p class=date>12:47pm CST Saturday 20 January 2001</p></p>

<p>I just shaved my head bald.  This is in preparation for the show
tonight, which my youth group is hosting.  Six bands for six dollars.
We'll have CiCi's pizza for the staff and the bands, and for sale to
everyone else.  Like last weekend, I have done nothing to plan or
organize the event.  Unlike last weekend, I'm not in charge of
anything tonight.</p>

<p>But the youth did ask me to shave my head so I can be a bouncer if
necessary.  Cool.</p>

<p>I'll spend the night out there tonight, cause the show will
certainly run late.  Then tomorrow afternoon we have the debriefing
meeting for last weekend's rally, and then at 4pm tomorrow, is a
mandatory KTRU DJ meeting before the new semester.  They said there
will be important news for the DJs; I wonder what it is...  Certainly
something about the new committee overseeing KTRU operations.</p>

<p class=date>6:15am CST Saturday 20 January 2001</p>
<p class=note>(dream)</p></p>

<p class=dream>With family at a family reunion type thing family from
my mom's side of the family, in a big house overlooking a large body of
water maybe an ocean.  My Aunt Madeleleine and cousin Bridgette were
thrre, and some YRUU were there, and we were just about to leave the
next day, so I was going to bed, but them some of the youth were all,
"hey, do you want to go to the amusement park next door?"

<p class=dream>We were next to Six Flags over Texas, and I was
explaining to someone that it was the best park in america because it
was the biggest park that I could visit free (wtih my Season Pass).</p>

<p class=dream>So we were on this small roller coaster that used
magnets instead of a track to determie where it should go..  I sat in
the front car, which did not have a seat belt, or event a front - it
was like sitting on a short little couch - we could get right off the
train.</p>

<p class=dream>We started to roll out of the station very close behind
the previous train.  I thought it was not safe, but I didn't say
anything to anyone.  Someone else said it didn't seem safe, but no one
stopped us.</p>

<p class=dream>We went out of the station and down and up and down and
I could occassionally see the train in front of us.  We were on a
track now, instead of using magnets.  Then the train went back inside
a different mansion and the youth had jumped off the first train to
scare the girls on my train.  They hid in a side room to jump out and
scare them, but we all got off the train before they had a chance to
scare us.</p>

<p class=dream>I couldn't find the train after that, so I was all,
"Dude, where's my train?" and then I switched it to "Dude, where's my
car?" and "Where's your car, Dude?"  The youth didn't think it was
quite as funy as I did.</p>

<p class=dream>The youth from the first train were helping look for
the train, and I was walking all trough this big house searching for
it.  I recognized I had no real idea how big the house was, nor how to
say, "okay I've looked here; I don't have to look here again."  because
it was just so big and strangley shaped mansion.</p>

<p class=dream>I found Carina in a room and she had a boyfriend there.
I gave her a big hug, but not a kiss because she had a boyfriend.  So
fun to see her again! She gave me an even longer big hug.</p>

<p class=dream>A youth with a walkie talkie had contacted someone
about something, and I thought it was someone about how to get a new
train.  So he handed me the walkie talkie, and I asked the guy, but he
was all, "what??" and I rezlized I had just been handed the walkie
talkie to say HI to the guy while my youth went into the kitchen to
grab something.  The reception was not as good in the kitchen, so he
didn't want to take it in there.</p>

<p>We're here at Tamina Hall, setting up for the show tonight.  The first
band members have arrived and started to move their stuff in.</p>

<p>I cut the back of my heel moving chairs - I clipped it on a chair leg
that didn't have the little plastic cap on the bottom.  Very similar injury
to when I cut it in Salt Lake City on the steps a couple years ago.</p>

<p>Now I have shoes and socks on.</p>

<p>Amy was all, "oh my gosh! you shaved your head and you're wearing
shoes!!"</p>

<p class=date>6:33 pm</p>

<p>I am so glad I have earplugs in.</p>

<p>Katy laughed to read that as I typed it.  HHahahahah!!!</p>

<p class=date>7:51 pm</p>

<p>Wow, it's not even 8 o'clock!!</p>

<p>The second band is finished, and the place is pretty packed.  It's 80% of
ridiculously packed.</p>

<p>I acted as bouncer for most of the first two bands.</p>

<p>Some people show me their stamp without asking, and some without question
if I ask.  and some are all, "i've been through before."</p>

<p>Right now Beth is being bouncer for us.  It looks like we will have a
great deal of dollars for charities.</p>

<p class=date>8:17 pm</p>

<p>Probably 150 people inside and 50 or 80 outside.  Band number 3 is
playing.  Pink Noise is their name.</p>

<p>Props to YRUU youth who came to the show, who are not in our youth group:
David, Luren, Laura, Matt, Richard, um..  I don't think any others..</p>

<p>They are all dancin crazy in the front center of the group... the
livliest f the crowd, but not a mosh pit.</p>

<p class=date>8:51 pm</p>

<p>Next to Nothing is playing and there is definitely a big mosh pit.
pretty much half the room is a mosh pit.</p>

<p class=date>9:08 pm</p>

<p>The mosh pit was actually sparser than I thought at first.  Only about 10
people at most were in it.  They had great energy level though.  Susie came
out with a slightly bloody lip.  Lead singer just said, "I've just come to
the realization that I can't sing.  That sucks."</p>

<p>Then some kds were sitting in the middle of the pit, and then one was
lying down in it.</p>

<p>Interesting reaction from a few people wo notice my Visor.</p>

<p>I think I may have to get cards with my url on it soon.  Then I can hand
out cards to peeps who ask about my journaling.</p>

<p class=date>9:51 pm</p>

<p>The last band is tuning up.</p>

<p>There is frost on the top of my car outside.  (as opposed to my car
inside, I guess.)</p>

<p>I bounced around in the mosh pit with them, but mostly just acted as
border patrol.  Once I got "bumped" as I think Lauren put it - knocked down,
but I caught myself with my hands.</p>

<p>Laura and Richard left; they have a curfew at their school in
Beaumont.</p>

<p class=date>11:55 pm</p>

<p>Show is over and I'm in Scott letting him warm up (my car)</p>

<p>Youth are inside playing and rejoicing in have hosted an absolutely
fabulous show.</p>

<p>I am so incredibly proudd and impressed.  Great great job!!!</p>

<p>Meg told me that the lead singer for Middle Finger was quite
entertaining, and she was certainly right.  He reminded me of the lead of
Brown Whorenet, who played at the KTRU Outdoor Show some years ago.   And
you know what is amazing that I just realized?  We got <em>almost</em> as
many people to this show as we did to  as came to the KTRU show.  Maybe I'm
totaly wrong, but the KTRU show was free and this one cost 6 bucks.  I'm
totally impressed with my youth!!</p>

<p>My car is warm; we will probably be leaving soon I'm sure.</p>

<p>We just watched the last half of The Cell, starring Jennifer Lopez.  It
seemed very odd, and artsy, and quite possibly cooler if we had seen the
whole thing.  Pretty neat though from what I saw.</p>

<p>Now we are likely to play mafia; and people are raiding the kitchen for
food.</p>

<p>Katy is on the sleepy side of awake, actually we all are,  but she is
lying on the ground.</p>

<p>We played Text-O-Grams and then Mafia  3 or 4 rounds.  I was god the
first time and had 2 mafia and 0 commissioners, and 4 townspeople.  The
mafia won handily.</p>

<p>We were sure Elija was mafia next because he said, "I'm sly like a fox
and qick like a raccoon."  We were all, waht?"  You must be mafia!</p>

<p>Katy says, "that would take a lot of effort and a lot of money that I
don't have."</p>

<p>Hethre says "it's not very mushy."</p>

<p>Amy says, "I'm all itchy!"</p>

<p>Hethre says, "Mrs Lowenberg, when she was growing up, her parents said
the dog was playing "choochoo" when really it was trying to hump her.  And
when her friends came over she had them play too."</p>

<p class=date>12:30am CST Friday 19 January 2001</p></p>

<p>At about 8:30pm I went to play ultimate for the first time in
several weeks.  Pretty much as I arrived and joined the group in the
parking lot, it started to rain, so we caravanned to House of Pies.
Only 4 of us made it; I guess the others decided to go home instead.</p>

<p>Mark, Sarah, Erol and I sat at one of the booths, talking about
random stuff, including how Mark's brother shot Mark's front tooth in
half with a pellet gun, how Erol can't handle the climate changes
between Houston and Venezuela, how Sarah's company purchased another
company recently, and how it felt when I got stung by a scorpion a
couple years ago.</p>

<p>Mark shared with us his favorite House of Pies treat: cottage fries
with beef boullion and mustard.  The beef boullion is called some
french thing like du jas or some such.  The mustard is Heinz 57
brand.  I tried a couple cottage fries with said seasoning and that
was enough for me.  bluh.</p>

<p>Oh, at the end of the evening, Mark outlined(*) his gambling record
for his most recent six excursions.  On one he was up 4500 dollars at
one point, but came back with only $200 extra.</p>

<p>After House of Pies, they went wherever they went, and I visited
Kat at KTRU.  I hadn't yet signed up for my shift this coming spring
semester.  Donna and I signed up to share the 7-9pm Saturday
timeslot.  We will probably tagteam it; we still haven't met yet.</p>

<p>I talked to Kat for probably 45 minutes, catching up on random
stuff and talking about KTRU stuff - music, callers, playlist, etc.
Pretty cool stuff.</p>

<p>I rode my (borrowed) unicycle on the way too and from the building
from and to the stadium, and it was blucky raining.  I got pissed when
I was riding through an expansive "lake" 2 inches deep and a car drove
past me too quickly and splashed water all over me.  I yelled an
obscenity at him and he didn't seem to notice.  I really think he had
no idea I was there, which is scary.  I arrived back at my car safely
despite this tragedy, and have made it home now.</p>

<p>(*) I spent nearly 8 minutes trying to think of the perfect word to
describe how marked told us his last 6 gambling trips worth of
wins/losses.</p>

HI

I have just moved online the New Improved Ritz Project.

Using eight sas macros, this model is able to host multiple organizational
health surveys, each with:

*) any number of pages
*) any number of languages
*) optional questions (asked only if user gives certain answers to a
different question)
*) optional pages (displayed only if user gives certain answers to a
different question)
*) a response rate site for the administrator of the survey

Each "set" of surveys ("set" = all surveys administered by a specific
administrator) has 3 datasets that define the characteristics of the set:  1
for password(s) for the admin(s), 1 for the text the admins see, 1 for
specifics of each survey in the set.

Each survey in a set requires 2 datasets:  1 for questions, and 1 for
responses.

    Yay!
    - Rob

<p class=note>(my 4am or so dream)</p></p>

<p class=dream>In a large mansion / shopping mall, with escalators and
lots of people, and it was Susie's (youth) house.</p>

<p>I may remember the bulk of this dream later.</p>

<p class=date>7:30am CST Monday 15 January 2001</p>
<p class=note>(dream)</p></p>

<p class=dream>Putting the roof on a house, I was on the very peak of
the house, and my friends were throwing (two friends) throwing shnigle
bundles up to me, but they were mostly throwing them entirely over the
roof.  One bundle of shingles stayed.  Otherwide, I was shoutin to
them, "too far!" each time a bundles of shingles went off the other
side of the roof. One time I idn'thave to tell them; they coul dsee
that the shingles didn't make it to even the peak of the roof, and
fell too short.</p>

<p class=dream>We said bye to someone who was leaving, but not
affiliated with us shingle people, but she was somehow part of
building the house.  I told her, we won't be done until the roof is
complete.  won't get down until the rof is complete.</p>

<p class=dream>I lay down a strip of shingles along the top edge of
this lower roof, and told my friend I wanted to use a chalk line to
snap a straight line on the roof so we could be sure the shingle row
was straight.</p>

<p class=dream>He didn't listen, but instead starting cutting through
the shingle and the roof wtih a hand held circular saw.  I was yelling
at him over the noise of the saw to stop, but he didn't.</p>

<p class=dream>I ran to one side of the roof and unplugged all the plugs we had
plugged in, but the saw kept running.  I ran to the other side of the
roof and unlugged all the plugs and the saw was still running.  Then I
saw some more plugs to unplug near the side where I was and unpluged
them and the saw finally stopped.</p>

<p class=dream>My friend loked madly up at me, <em>why did you uplug
it?</em> his expression demanded.</p>

<p class=dream>"I want to use a shalk line to make the shingles
exactly straight.  I think we've spent a long time on this and I want
to finish this last part correctly.  If you are too tired, it's okay;
I can finish it."</p>

<p class=dream>My friend left, teling me "just go to bed."</p>

<p>I woke up.</p>

<p class=date>7:52am CST Monday 15 January 2001</p></p>

<p>When I woke up from my dream, Wende woke up with a start, "Is it
Monday?" she asked.</p>

<p>"yeah."</p>

<p>"Fuck!" and she jumped out of bed, significantly late for work.</p>

<p>I think she's not irreparably late for work because she didn't call
anyone to tell them she was late (to have them cover for her).</p>
