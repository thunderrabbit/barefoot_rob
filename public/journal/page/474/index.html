<p class=date>2:41am CDT Thursday 18 July 2002</p></p>

<p>Earlier tonight, Katy and Fred drove from her house to Amy's Ice
Cream and I joined them for fun.  We laughed at graffitti on the
table, the best was "My name is __________.  I love __________."  We
improved on that as "_________ + __________ 4 ever."</p>

<p>Super wonderful thanks to Katy for amazingly patience as Fred
worked on my new journal indexing scheme.  I'm quite pleased and
amazed with Fred's regular expression skillz.  And Katy's patience.
She was way tired, but didn't complain about how late we were keeping
her up.</p>

<p>I'll be testing my new journal index soon, and it should be on my
site not too long after that.</p>

<p>I see what is part of the problem slowing me down in my final days
of clearing out my stuff.  It's difficult for me to just throw stuff
away, when it's perfectly good stuff.  <em>Someone</em> somewhere in
the world, right <em>now</em> is looking for a 3.5" floppy disk.  I've got
four right here that I'd be glad to give to that person.  How do I
find out where they are?</p>

<p>Oooh I think I heard of a website that is like ebay, but uses
bartering.  I wonder if I can find that site (but I'm not at Kinko's
right now).</p>

<p>This society just produces so much shit because we are mostly
taught that material possessions are where it's at.  Now I've got all
this stuff, and I assure you, it's not helping me live a simpler
happier life.</p>

<p class=date>2:24pm</p>

<p>I'm feeling ridiculously (ha, listen to my negativity) sad and
scared right now.  I have just turned in (donated) some items to The
Guild Shop, and my hardback <em>Cosmos</em> book to Montrose Library.
I received receipts as they can be deducted from my taxes.  I dropped
off my dual CD set "Japanese for Busy People" that goes with the book
by the same name to JASH (Japanese America Society of Houston) because
a woman had expressed interest in purchasing the CDs.  I already have
them so now I give them to her.  And I dropped off Kim Sawyer's 4 CD
set "Pimsleur's Spanish I," which helped me some when I was studying
Spanish.</p>

<p>After that I found myself just wrought with sadness overall for
this whole situation of giving up all my stuff and not knowing where
the fuck I'm going to be or who is going to take over my apartment
(Will was not approved and has to get a co-signer, who has to be
approved and it just seems like a damn snail crawling across a parking
lot how long this process is taking.  No TV-style resolution in 26
minutes..) and I stupidly cancelled my ad in The Houston Chronicle
after I got several phone calls including Will's application; I
assumed the shit would just be approved and be done with it.  It would
be just really blarpy if I have to take out a new ad because Will
isn't approved and the other people are no longer interested.</p>

<p>I'm amazingly thankful to Catherine who has donated some powdered
energy drinks that I can use if necessary on my trek.  She is also
going to purchase the filing cabinet.</p>

<p>Dad is going to get the futon back, and my endtable that I made in
9th grade.  I don't know about the bed or recliner or wooden
chairs.</p>

<p>Oh, and I still have an Elfa desk and shelves and the skinny tall
wooden shelves to release.</p>

<p>I disassembled the futon last night and slept on its mattress on
the floor.</p>

<p>Fred has been in Conroe since afternoon yesterday.  (He may have
spent the night at Dad's house; I dunno.)</p>

<p class=date>3:11pm</p>

<p>Heehee; the DJ at KTRU just said something like, "we're not going
to play any of that non-commercial crap today.  We'll have some
Madonna, and Britney Spears, and The Doors.  Okay, so here's Madonna's
"Like a Virgin." "  And he put on Aphex Twin instead.  Fun.</p>

<p>Yoga was fun, or at least different because I was at an actual
class that Catherine was teaching as a substitute teacher for her
instructor who normally teaches the class at The Fitness Exchange.</p>

<p>That was after Dad had come by and picked up the futon and the
nightstand I made in 9th grade.  Wende was there at the same time to
consult on clothes packing for SWUUSI and my trek.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>After hanging out with Katy and Fred at Amy's Ice Cream and my
apartment, where Fred essentially finalized the core components of my
new journal indexing mechanism, I visited Catherine and dropped off
the three drawer file cabinet to her apartment.</p>

<p>She gave me a sample of the protein drink bottles she gave me
yesterday or so, and introduced me to <a
href="https://www.stevia.com">stevia</a>, a super sweetening herb.
Wow; it's pretty sweet!</p>

<p>I gave her feedback on the yoga class, which she seemed to
appreciate.</p>

<p>We're going to dinner tomorrow; she's taking me to Bombay Palace as
a going away present.</p>

<p>I dropped off about 20 or 30 pounds of coins (no pennies) to
Meredith at the bank where she works.  She's depositing the money into
her account and then will ACH me a check for the amount.  Thanks to
Meredith for this free Coinstar service!</p>

<p>Purchased a vacuum bag and an archival box for genealogical stuff
from Container Store, dropped off a couple more things to Suzanne's
work <!Holocaust Museum> (leaf from Joana, quilt art from Lisa,
boomerang from Bryn, and a Scrabble game from Suzanne (being
returned).  I spelled out BAD on the scrabble game because we call one
another bad all the time.)</p>

<p>I'm a bit freaked now about all the stuff I have to do.  The
apartment is still not completely rented.  "Two more things" have to
be returned before his credit application will be approved.  I have
two more people that I told I would call on Monday (yesterday) if the
apartment was not rented by then, but I didn't call them because we're
still in this limbo state.</p>

<p>If Will is not approved by, say noon, I'm going to call these other
people and let them know the status.</p>

<p>I still have a bed.  The Guild Shop won't take mattresses.  I'm
going to talk to Tina who said she was interested in the bed.  I'll
donate it to her and she can pay me later if she wants if she can just
take if off my hands.  Actually I may make that the last thing that
goes away.</p>

<p>I still have a futon.  Dad is going to come pick it up on
Wednesday.  I'm also going to give him some boxes and my endtable I
made in 9th grade.</p>

<p>I need to get a garment bag to put nice clothes in during my trek.
It's not like I think I'll need to wear them, but I'm still a bit
unable to get rid of them all now.  Suit, button-up white shirts,
white tuxedo shirt...</p>

<p>I'm going to archive my genealogy in a sturdier acid-free box and
store it at Ma's house.  I'll give it to her when I see her at
SWUUSI.</p>

<p>Today I'll likely give to Meredith my bag of change so she can send
it to Brinks to be counted.  It's several dollars of change.</p>

<p>At Kinko's now, with other peeps, all vying for phone and ethernet
connections.  There's a girl here who's applying for lawschools in New
York and Los Angeles.  I saw her here a couple nights ago.</p>

<p>She let me use her phone line; I gave her a yellow adventure card.</p>

<p>I thought it might come to this: I haven't found people to purchase
my stuff, so it's being given away.  My dad is taking the futon, Jason
is welcome to take the recliner, Tina might find someone to buy the
bed, Catherine might take the filing cabinet.  I've just spoken to Roy
who will take the desk, shelves, other shelves, bed, recliner, two
chairs if no one else claims them.</p>

<p>This cascade began when I took my 15" monitor beside the dumpster
with my yellow adventure card on it, "visit www.robnugen.com to make a
donation for this monitor."  I went back upstairs to get a plastic bag
to put around the monitor since it's been raining a lot lately, and
when I came back down, Roy the maintenance guy was scooping it up.
"You throwin' this away?"</p>

<p>"Yessir."</p>

<p>"You coulda just said somethin'"</p>

<p>"I did say something by putting it out by the dumpster."</p>

<p>Went back upstairs and realized there was a lot more to be given
away.  Tracked down Roy again and he'll take 1/2 tomorrow and the
other 1/2 Thursday.</p>

<p>Excellent.</p>

<p>If you want anything before it goes to Roy, call me on my cellie,
or email <a href="mailto:rob@robnugen.com">rob@robnugen.com</a>.</p>

<p>Oops.</p>

<p>I was just twirling my wooden rifle from when I was on the color
guard in high school and I put a little dent/gouge in the ceiling.

<p>Super thanks to Roy for using his Maintenance Man Magic (key) to
switch on three washers for me in the laundry room.  All I did was ask
if he can get me some change.  He did even better than that.  :-)</p>

<p>I've just gotten my front tire fixed at University Schwinn.
Actually they said it was cheaper to just replace the tube.  The labor
costs are much higher to repair it.  So I kept the old tube (shoulda
asked if they had any others recently thrown away) so I can fix it
later with my newfound time.</p>

<p>Chillin' at Veronica's now; Dude is not here.  But I just dropped
off my old NT box, my <a href="https://www.apcc.com">APC</a> UPS,
Netopia DSL router, and extra cords.</p>

<p>Maggie called me not so long ago asking if I knew the non-emergency
number to the police.  She had been in an accident, but was okay.  I
told her it was quite alright to call 911 even if no one was hurt.</p>

<p>I'm thankful that she's fine, and that she called, because I had
put my snooze on for far too long and would likely have been late to
meet with Kim Sawyer.</p>

<p>However, soon as I started getting ready, Kim called, saying that
his house was on the verge of being flooded, and asked to
reschedule.</p>

<p>No problem.  zzzzzzz</p>
