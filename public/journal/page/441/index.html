<p>Excellent.  So glad that <a
href="https://www.cinerina.com">Karina</a> <a
href="https://reviews.cinerina.com/cinerina/manyhats.qry?function=detail&Layout_0_uid1=33134">pimped
it</a> quite so well.</p>

<p>Janette and I went with Johnny Wolf, the owner of The Wolf Shop (sp
on Wolf?), where I have gotten some work during my adventure.  He's a
pretty laid back cat, so it seems.  Janette has known him for a while
and they were definitely joking around a lot in the same sorta way
that points out ironies in the world and in ourselves.  Awesome.</p>

<p>Anyway, the movie fucking ruled.  But it made me just like,
embarassed to be an american.  I wonder if that's why I'm running off
to Japan?  On some level, yes.  I'm sick of the US and policies and
its fucking bullshit way of bullying around other countries.</p>

<p>The summary of US history was great and horribly sad, and oh so
true.  fucked up shit.</p>

<p>I'm glad that Michael Moore was able to do something good during
the making of the movie.  Congratulations to him.</p>

<p>My mind was thoroughly taken off of my missing the San Antonio
Rally during the movie.  When we got out of the theater though, it hit
me again.</p>

<p>I began to cry outside of the bookstore where a series of
children's books featuring a girl named Kaya (name of Johnny's
daughter) caught Johnny's eye.  I can't explain why it hit me then,
but .. yeah, probably because I was thinking of youths in general.
Bang.</p>

<p>I could be at San Antonio now, listening to all your stories and
zaniness and all that.  I'm sorry to be forced to let you down.</p>

<p>I feel really really really really sad about not being able to go
to San Antonio.  I cried with Janette hearing my sadness.  My greatest
fear, I told her, is that youth will be all, "where's Rob? where's
Rob? where's Rob?" and that they will somehow think that maybe I don't
love them quite enough to overcome all obstacles to attend the rallies
I said I would attend.</p>

<p>Know that I love you all more than most other things in the world.
It has taken a pretty big wacked out situation to keep me away, and I
trust that it is all ultimate, for the best for you, my beloved
youth.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Bill called my cellie while they were on the way to the rally.
Whole posse of youth, whose names I dare not mention since I'll miss
some.  But like 10 names from Tulsa I think.  So awesome.  I'm really
thankful for them thinking of me.</p>

<p>I love you all.</p>

<p>HI</p>

<p>I have just had a conversation with Doug Strong, the minister of
Community UU church in Plano.</p>

<p>He is encouraging me to step graciously away from YRUU, citing the
concerns of some adults in the district.  I asked him who are these
mysterious adults and he said the RE directors at his church.  He
didn't think Jennifer N-P was against the idea of me going to
rallies.</p>

<p>But, since I'm not an official advisor at a local congregation,
and that I am a <em>single</em> 32 year old man, hanging around with
youth to get my socialization...</p>

<p>I interrupted him there.  "I do *not* get my socialization from the
youth.  I have my men's group for that."  (Near the end of the
conversation I thought of more proof that I don't get my social needs
met by the youth:  I specifically will not attend young adult
activities in the district because that would put me on a peer-to-peer
level with some of my ex-youth.  Unacceptable.)</p>

<p>I had previously (2 weeks ago) told him that I saw an email
indicating that the Houston youth might be planning to honor me at the
Houston rally.  During this conversation he said he had spoken with a
minister in Houston who knew of no such plan.  When he said this, I
simply acknowledged that it's true that any such alleged plans are not
yet set.  (It's not surprising to me to think that a minister would
not be aware of any such plans; not often have Houston ministers taken
the time to help plan the rallies.)</p>

<p>He suggested that it's possible that Nova will ask me to go teach
in plan before Houston rally, which would make this conversation
moot.</p>

<p>I let him know that for the past six years I have put YRUU events
as my number one priority.  Above work, above family, above KTRU (and
I know how much I love KTRU), above everything.  It's not bloody
likely that Nova would suddenly have an offer so tempting that I would
suddenly decide to not attend my specifically chosen final rally of
all.  That rally which I've told my youth many times "Houston Rally
will be my last rally," with as much cheer as I can, knowing the
implications my leaving YRUU will have on some youth.  I tell them
that YRUU is for the youth and they will have great and wonderful and
incredible things to see and do, that this is all in the big scheme of
things, and even that I *have* to go to Japan; I have to leave YRUU
sometime, and my chosen time is after Houston Rally.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I have gotten myself into a predicament that is not a youth issue.
It was my own stupid fucking fault and I'm really really sad about it;
I wish it had never happened.  Never come close to happening.  Never
even considered the concept.</p>

<p>But it did, and it's still not a youth issue.  In my judgement, it
shouldn't affect my attendance at rallies.  But it has.  I am
sorry.</p>

<p>I'm going to be talking to more people than Doug.  Steve, Debbie,
Susie, maybe others.  I want the overall outcome to be positively
beneficial to my beloved youth.</p>

<p>Know that, no matter what, I am still Rob.  And I still love you.
I look forward to hearing how you're doing in the world of YRUU and
beyond.  My email address will be good for a long long time.</p>

<p>I have just called Doug and scheduled a talk with him at 1:pm
ish.</p>

<p>yammering about japan</p>

<p>there are adults in the district who think it&rsquo;s time for you to move on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;yeah well fuck them&rdquo; I&rsquo;m thinking.</p>

<p>Gail didn&rsquo;t know about dedication to me so maybe it&rsquo;s not a done deal</p>

<p>he&rsquo;s repeating a story about about japan that he already told me.</p>

<p>re directors at plano</p>

<p>liability issues for someone not involved as a regular advisor</p>

<p>so the fact that I&rsquo;ve been an advisor for 6 years means nothing?</p>

<p>they think I am getting my socialization from YRUU.</p>

<p>I told him about my men&rsquo;s group</p>

<p>Because I&rsquo;m single and 32 and playing with the youth</p>

<p>If you were someone in my congregation, I would tell you to move on.
and I know that&rsquo;s hard to hear.</p>

<p>The potenetial liability issue if someone says something.</p>

<p>I would urge you to think carefully about it.</p>

<p>I can understand that you&rsquo;re angry; I would be pissed.</p>

<p>I explained my quandry; I can either not go to the rally and lie to
my youth about why.  They know my schedule and my priorities.  They
know I wouldn't let anything get in the way.  Except maybe my own
death.  If anyone else dies, fuck them, they'll still be dead after
the rally.</p>

<p>I pointed out that none of the reasons he told me not to go include
that it would be better for the youth if I don't go.  None.  All of
them were based on my safety and covering my ass.</p>

<p>He appreciated that I listened to him and appear to be taking his
advice into consideration.  He also suggested that I talk to other
adults to get input from them.</p>

<p>Janette and I made pies last night.  She did most everything, but I
sure did a good job pouring sugar into the bowl as the egg whites were
being whipped.  (M & M, what is the difference between whipping eggs
and beating eggs?)  Oh, and I monitored the heavy cream to make sure
it didn't turn into butter.  Such a challenge it was for me to stop
the thing; she said soon it would have turned into butter just like
<em>that</em> with a snap of her fingers.  Wow.</p>

<p>"Add a little salt and it would taste just like butter," she
added.</p>

<p>"Really?  Butter would taste like.... <em>butter</em>??"</p>

<p>Oh, I also got to mix peanutbutter and powdered sugar for the
peanutbutter pie.  I have a very sweet tasting t-shirt on now.</p>

<p>We made banana cream pie and peanutbutter pie.</p>

<p>Oh, and I got to put the merange on the pb pie.  I'm an expert
meragner I'm sure, especially since I think I'm spelling that
incorrectly.  Merangue?  Wow. I can't even find it on <a
href="https://www.m-w.com">m-w.com</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, yummy pies.</p>

<p>Over the past couple of days I have been reading <em>Stranger in a
Strange Land</em> to Janette.  She had read it a long time ago, and I
have never previously read it.</p>

<p>I seem to read just fine for an hour (?) maybe and then my eyes and
mouth seem to get desynchronized and/or just make up words.  But, I
made it through Part I of the book (8 chapters total in Part I), of
four Parts.</p>

<p>Yesterday Sean was talking with his mom, having some money issues,
as many college students do.</p>

<p>She was all, "don't worry Sean, tomorrow you'll have lots of
money," cause she was going to send him about a hundred dollars.</p>

<p>Instead, she accidentally deposited her check ($800) into his
account ($100).  So she burst in the door like "can I use the
computer?" and verified what she had done.  "D'oh!!"</p>

<p>Hahahahhaah!!!</p>

<p>Sean's going to be all <em><b><font size='+2' color=magenta>"THANKS,
MOM!!!!!"</font></b></em></p>

<p>Okay, now she has transferred the money to her account.</p>

<p><em><b><font size='+2' color=magenta>"NEVERMIND!"</font></b></em></p>

<p>Funny funny.</p>

<p>Josephine, Tara, Logan just came home for their non-third-period
class.  Joey was all, "my mom made BREAD????"</p>

<p>me: "yeah, we taught her how."</p>

<p>"Yeah right."</p>

<p>As she was cutting it, I was all, "haha we got it while it was warm."</p>

<p>She spent a moment thinking of a snappy comeback, then looks at me
with shrewd eyes, "... I can toast it."</p>

<p>That was funny enough.</p>

<p>But then she burnt the toast a bit... hahaha</p>

<p>They are so much fun!</p>

<p>Took Scott to Kinko's where I read livejournal.  Ryan and Jackie
are funny verbally ripping at one another.  Read about those cats
hostaging an entire theater of other cats in Moscow (?).  Yikes,
stripes!</p>

<p>I can tell I'm not emotionally invested in that situation, but I
agree it's pretty fucked up.</p>

<p>Also got to chat with Maggie a bit.  It's so apparent to me that
she is so much better off without John.  She's completely excelling in
many areas of her life.  Such a relatively short grieving period for
her as well.  I'm amazed and thrilled.</p>

<p>I hope John is doing well as well.</p>

<p>Back home and then rode my bike to CD World to get the Uncle
Kracker self titled CD for Janette.  She said she really liked his
music and hoped I would too.  I'm listening to the second song on the
CD now.  I pretty much do not like it.  Good thing I bought it for
her, not for myself.</p>

<p>Talking to Janette, telling her about how awesome Sally is to me.
She asked several questions about her and our relationship.</p>

<p>Janette wondered aloud of how we can stay on the right side of the
line of using people too much, and being completely self sufficient
and not talking to other people at all.  I suggested that this answer
would be different for everyone, and would even change for a
particular person from moment to moment.</p>

<p>We were yammering about Sally when she (Sally) called me back!</p>
