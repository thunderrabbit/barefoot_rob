<p><p>At midnight last night Wende and I were awakened by the endless
shreiking of a house alarm.  Wende verified it wasn&rsquo;t our alarm, and
after several minutes she went to look outside.  Said she saw a police
car outside of Jennifer&rsquo;s house (our northern neighbor), but no other
activity.</p>

<p><p>Thankfully, I was able to sleep through its cadence, but woke up
when it stopped.  <em>Was it actually stopped?</em> The alarm echoed
through my head.</p>

<p><p>Ah. so nice.  Drifting back to sleep then</p>

<p><p><em>!WHEEP!WHEEP!WHEEP!WHEEP!WHEEP!WHEEP!WHEEP!WHEEP!</em></p>

<p><p>It blasted again.  The blaring droned as I got up, opened a window
to see if it was louder that way.  It was.  So either it was right
next to us, or was so crazy loud that the entire neighborhood could
hear it.</p>

<p><p>After some minutes, it finally stopped.  This time for the
remainder of the night.</p>

<p><p>Work &ldquo;today&rdquo; was unique in that I actually caught up with all the
projects.  By this I mean that there was no more SAS programming to be
done until we hear more from our clients.  Wow!</p>

<p><p>I transcribed some 1991 journal entries, recognizing that I&rsquo;m more
inspired to do so now that Molly has offered to help.  :-)</p>

<p><p>Tomorrow at work we will celebrate Kevin&rsquo;s birthday!!  I&rsquo;m greatly
excited to give him his new plate.  He loves baseball, and is a Red
Sox fan.  It has an image of the Boston Red Sox logo on the front, but
instead of &ldquo;BOSTON RED SOX&rdquo; it says &ldquo;ALL MY RED SOX&rdquo; (since he (and
Karla and Drew and Kasi and Erika) all enjoy watching All My Children
during lunch each day)</p>

<p><p>I completed the rough draft of the DTRU project at work.  Tomorrow
we will show the guy this rough draft, let him request changes and
I&rsquo;ll make all the changes by Friday hopefully.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>So I just got home and Wende called, asking me to go pick up a vase
from Mad Potter for a friend of hers.  Wende was supposed to pick it
up, but she was late leaving work and couldn&rsquo;t get the vase and be on
time to her meeting.</p>

<p><p>Why do I get so grouchy about Wende leaving work late?  I feel like
she&rsquo;s always always late (often making me late) and we go round and
round with this weird thing about me wanting her to hurry, which makes
her feel anxious and not go as quickly and it&rsquo;s just a messed up silly
situation.</p>

<p><p>So now that I&rsquo;ve slandered my beloved fiance across the internet, I
shall now go pick up the vase.</p>

<p><p>To be sure, Wende is incredible.  Smart, funny, cute, beautiful,
and so much fun to play with!  She&rsquo;s my bestest friend in the world.</p>

<p><p>Okay, now I&rsquo;ll go get the vase.</p>

<p><p>Tonight is 1 day away from Summer Solstice!!  For some strange reason, this fact has totally been escaping me&hellip;  I&rsquo;ve been wasting precious daylight!</p>

<p><p>After eating at Mission Burrito with Deborah (sp) and Wende, I rode
my (borrowed) unicycle a total of about 13 blocks!  All the way from
our house to the middle of the American General parking lot (4 blocks
or so), then a few short rides in the parking lot, then several false
starts when leaving the parking lot, but once I got started, I rode 4
blocks along West Dallas (4 lane street) to the Chevron station at the
corner of Montrose and W Dallas (including going up their little
driveway ramp!)  I filled the tire with air, and found it even easier
to ride back home, even over some small bumps and some gravel.  Great
job!</p>

<p><p>Drenched with sweat when I came back in.  I got in the shower and
slowly turned the water from warm water all the way to cold water
only.  Oh so nice to cool off!</p>

<p class=date>9:04pm CDT Monday 19 June 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Today after work, Wende and I met her parents (her New Branfels
parents) and sister Julie and Julie&rsquo;s friend Marie Claire at the
airport as they were waiting for their next flight.</p>

<p><p>To TGI Fridays, where they gave Wende and me t-shirts (Hard Rock
Cafe St Maarten (Dutch spelling) and some cool coral!  Wende gave them
all gifts (father&rsquo;s day, mother&rsquo;s day, Julie&rsquo;s birthday).</p>

<p><p>Our waiter was all, &ldquo;what day?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Julie&rsquo;s birthday.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>In an almost sneaky subtle way, over a twenty minute period, 5
different balloons were attached to Julie&rsquo;s chair by different members
of the wait staff.  &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s birthday is it?&rdquo;  &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;  &ldquo;How
old are you?&rdquo;  etc.  It was pretty funny when the third person asked
&ldquo;who&rsquo;s birthday is it?&rdquo;  when three balloons already apparently
identified Julie as the star.</p>

<p><p>When one of the balloons came loose from the chair, Marie Claire
re-tied it, asking, &ldquo;who&rsquo;s birthday is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>We all laughed at her joke, which was cool because until then she
hadn&rsquo;t really said much around me an&rsquo; Wende.</p>

<p><p>The greatest entertainment that night was tying five balloons to
five different braids on Julie&rsquo;s and Marie Claire&rsquo;s tight and thinly
braided hair.  (They had thin stylish braids with beads at the bottom
of each braid.)  Marie Claire got the idea to tie a balloon to one of
Julie&rsquo;s braids, but Julie was all, &ldquo;no way!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Julie was happy, however, to tie a balloon to one of Marie Claire&rsquo;s
braids.</p>

<p><p>I tied another balloon to the other side, and it was hilarious!
Marie Claire and I got the camera from Wende&rsquo;s truck and I took two
pictures of her outside.</p>

<p><p>Back inside, Julie joined the balloon style, with the other three
balloons.  More pictures, including one of everybody taken by our
waiter.</p>

<p><p>- -</p>

<p><p>Happy family after dinner, and I drove us all back to the airport
(during which time, balloons were removed with slight difficulty
without cutting the hair.)  Hugs to Wende&rsquo;s family and friend, then I
drove Wende and myself back home.</p>

<p><p>- - 7:30 am Tuesday - -</p>

<p><p>I had an astonishing headache and slept for 10 hours.</p>

<p><p>Wende and I awoke to the buzzing drone of a helicopter, alternately loud then whisper quiet at two minute intervals.</p>

<p><p>I drove over to investigate.  A helicopter was airlifting big white metal things to the top of the American General building!  I took pictures, and talked to a guy who was watching while drinking his morning coffee.</p>

<p><p>Right now I&rsquo;m at NTB getting tires for Wende&rsquo;s truck and they are totally taking longer than I expected.  I was Supposed to bring lunch to Wende at noon.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ve been placing little Post-It notes in Book One of my diary, indicating entries for the lovely and talented Molly to transcribe for me!!</p>

<p><p>I greatly appreciate her offer!</p>

<p><p>So weird to read how my entire life was centered around sex and &ldquo;millions of girls&rdquo; etc.  Not that anything has changed except for the number of women..</p>

<p><p class=date>12:40pm</p>Leaving now. Turns out they were low on stock of the tires I wanted and had to go get a fourth elsewhere.</p>

<p><p>KTRU required more than twice as much paperwork today, which made
for a sub-amazing show.  We always have to write down each song artist
and title that we play.  But today we had to <em>also</em> write in a
different log, the artist, title, song writer/composer, and the time
the song was played.</p>

<p><p>The biggest pain in the bootay about all that is figuring out who
is the writer or composer!  Some CDs are great: &ldquo;All songs written by
___________&rdquo; Some just said, &ldquo;All songs copyright _________&rdquo; (which I
used as the writer), but some didn&rsquo;t have crap for the writer, so I
spent a lot of extra time, reading the fine print of CDs looking for
ones that I could easily determine who wrote the things!</p>

<p><p>At least half of the CDs I had originally selected were
subsequently put back in the stack unplayed; I didn&rsquo;t know who to
credit.  This is kinda a pisser for those artist who did write the
songs - now they won&rsquo;t get credit nor paid for it&hellip;  (That&rsquo;s the
whole idea - keep track of who wrote the songs so they get paid
royalties)</p>

<p><p>Anyway, My show as sloppier than usual, and I didn&rsquo;t get enough playlist or alternative tracks played.  Oh well.  Next week I&rsquo;ll do it, but this week, the playlist and alternate tracks can bite my butt.</p>

<p><p>Wende and I saw Shaft today!  I liked it pretty much way better
than MI:2; I give Shaft 2 thumbs up.  There was one and a half good
plot twists, and even a maybe line from Pulp Fiction: (Shaft, upon
walking into his friend&rsquo;s dirty apartment &ldquo;This is some repugnant
shit!&ldquo;)  And they had a scene that reminded me of The Matrix (building
to building jump through glass window), my other favorite movie.</p>

<p><p>Go check out Shaft.</p>

<p><p>ps: Oh! The coolest thing: With my new Handspring Visor, I took
&ldquo;notes&rdquo; during the movie previews.  The movies that look good I put in
my &ldquo;see&rdquo; list.  The dumb looking movies I put in my &ldquo;do not see&rdquo; list.
Wende and I differed on which movie should go in which list, but
they&rsquo;re my lists.  ;-)</p>

<p class=note>(Dreams)</p>

<p><p>(1)</p>

<p><p class="dream">I was arrested for creating a nuisance, and disturbing the peace
in a small town, but the arrest was somehow a joke (on whom, I don&rsquo;t
know, cause I was in on it), so they still let me go to Australia and
even gave me $500 calling card so I could check in each day.</p>

<p><p>I don&rsquo;t remember much more detail of this dream&hellip;</p>

<p><p>(2)</p>

<p><p class="dream">I was at General Assembly which was in Salt Lake City
in a hotel.</p>

<p><p class="dream">A minister came to watch some youth who were up late late playing
with those little paddle with ball on rubber string things (what&rsquo;s it
called?)  and she (minister) asked me what was the point of the game?
I explained how if the ball was thrown, it would be snapped back by
the rubber string, thereby allowing the person to try to hit it.</p>

<p><p class="dream">These were crazy long rubber strings though, stretching all the way
to the ceiling of the gymnasium and attached there, then back down,
so it was more like the ball was a bouncing swinging pendulum that
youth were trying to hit with the paddle (which was also attached to
the same point in the ceiling via rubber string).</p>

<p><p class="dream">Fricke was there, with his own wacky version of the game, where the
rubber string was all wrapped around his body and then would come
spiraling off and sling in some random direction.</p>

<p><p class="dream">I went to bed, but then saw Melissa (from OKC)
and she was all, &ldquo;want to go get some breakfast?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class="dream">&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class="dream">&ldquo;How about at Crystal Palace?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class="dream">So we hopped in her car and she drove us away from the
hotel toward the Crystal Palace, where we had GA the previous year.</p>

<p><p class="dream">I didn&rsquo;t recognize the buildings 100%, but they were the streets of
Boston (or was it Chicago?) and kept on driving until the city
abruptly arrived at a large wooden pier, drove way out onto it, and
waited for people to get out of the way so we could turn right onto a
narrower pier thing.  Drove a bit, then turned right again and
actually 2 tires went off the side of the pier (Melissa&rsquo;s side) and I
freaked a bit, she was all, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s no problem&rdquo; and sure enough, once
she got around the little obstruction she had avoided, we drove back
all four tiers onto the pier.</p>

<p><p class="dream">Then we were there at the Crystal Palace, which was a small Chinese
seafood restaurant on this pier.  We were parked under their porch
awning thing and the busboy looked out the window and I was all ,&ldquo;is
this your valet parking?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class="dream">&ldquo;Actually it&rsquo;s all the way on the other side of the pier.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class="dream">Well is there somewhere close we can park?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class="dream">He pointed to a spot that was just behind us, where we would no
longer be under their awning.  &ldquo;Parallel parking right there.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class="dream">Melissa was all, &ldquo;can you parallel park?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class="dream">After you were able to drive 2 wheels off the pier and back on,
you can&rsquo;t parallel park? I thought to myself.  &ldquo;Um yeah.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class="dream">Then the guy was all, &ldquo;do you want us to get some soup for you
while you move the car?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class="dream">I was all, &ldquo;um, yeah water is fine,&rdquo; assuming he had asked about
drinks.</p>

<p><p class="dream">Melissa was all, &ldquo;no, what kind of soup do you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class="dream">They showed me the options, and they were all named after first
names of movie stars and cartoon characters &ldquo;Elmer&rdquo; Cheetoh, Howard
Louis, Buster, Maynard - there was about 50 options.  I recognized
there was no description,and was I just supposed to see which name I
liked best?</p>

<p><p>and I woke up.</p>

<p><p>I did it!!!</p>

<p><p>Look below&hellip; I made automagic links to previous and next journal
entries!</p>

<p><p>I haven&rsquo;t tested them if there are only zero, one, or two entries
in the directory, but for any number greater than that, they should
work!</p>

<p><p>The way I did it seems pretty slick, and takes only a teeny bit more CPU time than the script already used.  Way way super cool!</p>

<p><p>They for sure do not work to visit entries in the previous or next month.  I have very little urge to do that, though.</p>
