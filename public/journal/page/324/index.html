After the museum we visited Hiroshima Castle, which had little
remaining except a pagoda tower thing which had been rebuilt since the
bomb.  Originally built back possibly as early as 600s, it was
definitely built by 1500s and went through a variety of owners over
the years.</p>

<p>The rebuilt tower is steel and concrete, almost certainly not what
it had been before the bomb, but whatever.  They had some
interesting(?) suits of armor and other collectibles on display.  No
cameras allowed though.</p>

<p>The hotel staff woman correctly told me how we can get to
Starbucks, where I bought for Carla at work a mug that says Hiroshima.
janette didn't want to buy / eat / drink anything.</p>

<p>I've got a bit of a headache now, but we're going to go eat to see
if that helps.</p>

<p>All the walkin' with no water today probably was a big factor.</p>

<p>Have just visited the Hiroshima Peace Museum and the other thing
honoring the deceased and..  wow.</p>

<p>Hey Bush, before you unsign the anti-nuke thing, maybe you should
come visit Hiroshima.  That bomb was fucked <em>up</em>.</p>

<p>Did you know there was 50 kilos of uranium in the bomb that fell,
but only 10 kilos actually detonated?  I didn't.  This shit could have
been five times more destructive.  Damn.</p>

<p>Certainly newer technologies would be less likely to waste 80% of
their payload.  Just how much uranium is planned per detonation these
days?</p>

LOTS of little kids from elementary to senior high are out here.
Many are running amok.  janette and I watched a ceremonial offering of
folded paper cranes to the outdoor paper crane display.  Probably 1000
paper cranes were presented by this elementary class.</p>

<p>Soon as they were finished, the next elementary class began their
ceremonial offering of 1000 paper cranes.</p>

<p>I know a day has been full or lazy or distracting or both if the
first entry is a sleep entry.</p>

<p>Rode bikes with janette.  My pedal <em>fell off</em>.  May need to
replace it sooner than planned.  7500 yen for a new crankset.  Sigh.</p>

<p>Went to Miho's with janette.  Mmmmmmmm.</p>

<p>Went shopping with janette.  She yammered with ..   wait that was
yesterday I think.</p>

<p>Read _Stranger In A Strange Land_ to janette.  Chapter xxxii.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Tomorrow (and by tomorrow I mean we have to leave in 5.5 hours)
we're going to Hiroshima (for one night) and then Kyoto (for three
nights).  I haven't packed.  Yay.   But I have made some preparations,
like purchasing all the tickets we'll need for airplanes, shinkansens,
hotels.  Have collected a few snailing addresses of peeps in Japan.
Not so many of peeps in US.  But email me your snailing address within
5 hours and I can send you a postcard.</p>

<p>Got my bike registered, bought a new light, learned that my bike
lock is better than the ones readily available at the bike shop.</p>

<p class=date>12:44pm</p>

<p>Rode bikes to the bike parking lot where I used my cable to lock
both wheels and the bike to the bike parking space.  I think it will
be safe.</p>

<p>Ate at kaitein sushi then stood like excited kids at the front of
the train to Shibuya station.</p>

<p>The Shibuya girls were not out in full force, but we saw a couple,
and we saw a young man striding in a long black <em>crushed
velvet</em> robe over a black crushed velvet skirt and white button up
shirt and tie.</p>

<p>Dude.</p>

<p>Now we're in the Starbucks where I meet with Ayana most Fridays.  I
snuck janette in through the top back door of the facility, so she
thought I was taking her to some random office building and into an oh
my gosh where are we going oh hey it's Starbucks!</p>

<p>Heehee I'm so sneaky.</p>

<p class=date>4:17pm</p>

<p>Holy cow.  I stood transfixed for minutes watching this guy do
tricks on his bike.  He could stand on one axel peg and use his other
foot to spin the wheel propelling him further.  This is equivalent-ish
to way-high level unicycling tricks.  But then he would spin the frame
of the bike around underneath his body, sometimes jumping over the
frame so only his hands were touching the handlebars.  He often
remounted the bike without touching the ground.  Once, he finished the
trick by standing up on the frame of the bike as it rolled backwards,
then sat down on it normally.</p>

<p>Wow. wow. wow.</p>

<p>Gah.</p>

<p>I crossthreaded my pedal when I put it on my bike yesterday.  It
was crooked and I noticed it, but I thought the pedal was bent or
something else besides having been cross threaded.  Crossthreaded.
Oh.  I can fix that.  Took it to the bike shop, pedal off, pedal on;
now it's worse.  It went on straightly, but the threads are so fucked
that it's <em>loose</em> and not just crooked, but wobbly and crooked.
Could be several yen to replace the crank and pedals.  Fuckin' hell.
And janette just had one crank replaced (the other one, thank
goodness).  Shit.</p>

<p>Saw some little kids playing baseball.  Best thing: a single girl
playing competitively with all the boys.  She could catch anything
that came near her.  Worst thing: the umpire/parent throwing a
(rubber) baseball at (t)(his) kid when he hit a foul, then throwing
his glove at the kid on the subsequent foul. Then booting the kid in
the butt, knocking him down on the third foul.  Why didn't anyone say
anything?  Why didn't I go kick that guy's ass?  Stupid Japan.</p>
