<p>I'm at Veronica's clinic now to get bloodwork done, a euphemism for
STD testing.  This has been so much fun!  I have met a woman named
Bryn (!) (actually her name is spelled Brynne, but hey it sounds the
same) *and* I got two new decorations for my computer, two ink stamps:
one saying</p>

<pre>
Medicare Waiver
 Not Required
</pre>

<p>and the other is a smiley face.  I saw the first stamp on the desk,
stamped it on the cover of my computer and looked for some tape to
seal it from smearing.  No tape found... but then Stephanie walked in
with a roll of big clear tape!  Perfect!</p>

<p>When she saw how pleasing I found the new decoration, she was all,
"we've got more stamps," and offered up the smiley face and more
tape.  Beautiful.</p>

<p>It's cold outside, and I'm pretty much letting that keep me
inside.  Been reading LJs and doing maintenance on my computer and
website.  Considering actually building some other parts to my
website, like a FAQ and ABOUT and stuff.</p>

<p>Gonna go soak in the hot tub, if it's actually hot (or pretty darn
warm)</p>

<p>Dude and I just got back from riding up and down a big hill near
his house.  Probably 400 feet up this muddy steep narrow trail that
neither of us could ride up.  Had to walk.  Feet would often slip on
the steeper parts.  Actually I could ride up on the less steep parts
if sharp granite gravel covered the trail, but not otherwise.</p>

<p>Near the top of the hill, it smoothed out some, so we could ride
around the top.  A post was planted there in 1969.  I was all, "d'oh!!
Someone has already been here!!!" like we had discovered a new land.
"But at least no one has been here since 1969."</p>

<p>Beautiful cloud shrouded view of the mountain some miles away.
Fog hung around us as well; we had made it to the clouds.</p>

<p>Then down down down down not like speed demons, but faster than
running and definitely more dangerous.  At the steeper parts it was so
difficult to find the perfect amount of brakeage to keep the mud
covered tires rolling some to give us some traction, but not so much
speed that we couldn't navigate.  Often my back wheel would lock up
and slide sideways, making for particularly difficult time steering
down the hill and staying on my bike.</p>

<p>I dismounted twice.  Once headlong into some briars, and once kinda
into a tree, but mostly just using it to stop me.</p>

<p>Dude dismounted twice as well I think.  One time he was going over
a hill and his front wheel slipped sideways and he jumped over his
handlebars to the safety of the soft ground.  We both laughed.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the hill we found the steepest, ruttiest parts,
plus had to *not* go over a four foot vertical drop to the parking
lot, which featured a pile of steel pipe, presumably for installing
sewer lines for a set of lots nearby.</p>

<p>Then the *real* speed began, when we got to head home on the paved
roadway with wonderfully steep grade.  In my top gear 3-8, I could not
always keep up with my wheels.  So incredibly awesome!!</p>

<p>Had to slow for some 180 degree turns marked with 15 and 20 mph
warning signs but other than that, we just hauled ass downhill.</p>

<p>The gentle switchbacks with suggested speed of 30 mph were easily
navigable (navigatable?)  at our topmost speed.  Hmmm.  Need more
speed somehow.</p>

<p>To the bottom of the hill, flat ground back to his neighborhood
entrance, but then up up up up up in low gear to get back up to his
house.  I wonder how many vertical feet we rode down that hill &
road.</p>

<p class=note>(dreams)</p>

<p class=dream>Wende and I were at SWUUSI and I saw Bryn and her mom.
Grabbed Wende by the hand and ran up to Bryn.  "HI!" but she was
rather non-responsive.  So I told her I got her a guitar pin from Hard
Rock Cafe, and she didn't seem to want it.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class=dream>Saw some cats doing tricks on skateboards, jumping over
curbs and chain guardrails and such.  I decided I could do it and went
up to the top of the hill.</p>

<p class=dream>I got scared at first, and then recoginized it was a
dream.</p>

<p class=lucid>"This is a dream, just do a 360 over the chain."
Rolled down the hill and lept when I came near the curb, did a 360
counterclockwise over the curb and chain and landed with glee on the
other side.</p>

<p class=dream>Then we were inside a rather large, glass walled
elevator car, sitting along the sides of it, and the sliding elevator
doors didn't lead out of the elevator, but just to the elevator's own
entry way, which was in itself another elevator.</p>

<p>I've just arrived at a rest area, about 120 miles from Dude's.
(Eugene is 108 mile closer to SF than Portland, according to
Veronica.)  3576 miles on my trek. 152077 miles on Scott.  420 miles
so far today I think.</p>

<p>Been listening to mp3s via my cassette adapter and computer.  I'm
really happy with this setup.  22% battery left, so I'll conserve it
for a while, though I wonder if it could make it to Dude's...  Aw heck
nothing to lose if the computer goes to sleep due to no battery.  I'll
see if it makes it.</p>

<p>But, first things first.</p>

<p>I'm at an oil changin' place in Novato, California, just north of
San Francisco.  I took Wende across the Golden Gate Bridge with me,
dropped her off at her truck, parked in Loretta's parking space at her
apartment complex.  This parking arrangement saves her money on
parking, but kinda inconvenient for driving.</p>

<p>I got lost trying to get to the Penzoil place here, which
frustrated me cause I knew Wende's family is waiting for her to come
rescue them from the hotel.  Wende stopped by a gas station to get her
oil changed and still made it to the oil changin' place before I did.</p>

<p>A weird thing is though I have an idea about how I got lost (wrong
turn), I got doubly lost on the way back. I'm usually able to retrace
my steps, and if not, at least to know geometrically which direction I
am away from a particular place.  Not this time.</p>

<p>But I made it here, locked my keys in Scott, gave Wende a hug,
found out that my keys were locked in Scott when Ashley came out to
take my information and such.  Fortunately I have an extra key in my
backpack, which was on my back.  Whew!</p>

<p>Whew.</p>

<p>More hugs to Wende and when she was all, "this is difficult [to
leave]" so I snuffed in her ear like a dog to give her chills down the
leg.  Not necessarily supportive of her emotions in that moment, but
something by which she can remember me.</p>

<p class=date>2:11pm</p>

<p>We go.  151658 miles on Scott.  3157 miles on this trip since
Dallas.</p>

<p class=date>3:41pm</p>

<p>96 miles driven since I dropped off Wende.  Have passed through
Sonoma Valley and Napa Valley (I assume it was those; I was definitely
in a valley with signs for Sonoma and Napa all about).</p>

<p>Saw a couple of big sized roller coasters in a park at the 37 and
I-80.  What amusement park is that, I wonder...</p>

<p>Cool rainbow ahead of me for a while.  I got some pictures of it.</p>

<p>Now I'm at a gas station to pee and wake up more.</p>

<p>(Computer didn't make it, so I had to call Dude to get the final
bit of directions to his house.)</p>

<p>Have arrived at Dude and Veronica's some hours ago.  Dude and I
have been watching TV while he's been playing Civilization on his
laptop.  My laptop has been charging, as it went to sleep hard and
wouldn't wake up before getting a battery boost.</p>

<p>Their house is nice.  Three stories and all that, plus hot tub in
the back.</p>

<p>We're going to see <em>Twin Towers</em> tomorrow at 7pm.  Good
stuff.</p>

<p>380 miles from Portland (I don't know if I have more or fewer miles
to travel to Dude & Veronica's).  I don't really know where on the 5 I
am.  But I would like to note there's a mysterious white substance
piled up along the sides of the freeway.  Lumpy like a big pile of
powdered sugar.  Very interesting...  what ever could it be??</p>

<p>3418 miles traveled since Dallas.</p>

<p>I figured it out!  I know what is a big part of the fear that
wrenches me, rends me useless when I begin these treks alone out into
the world.</p>

<p>It's a fear that I'll be alone.  That I really am alone.  That I won't
be able to meet people every where I go..  That's the fear, or at
least a big part of it.  Such a silly silly fear!  Begone, silly fear!
Adios, payaso to you, buddy!  Whoohooo!!!!</p>

<p>I had this epiphany while driving and thinking of
other places to visit, and I got a flash of Mia Wallace in Pulp Fiction
who said something like, "I go to Amsterdam for a month every year
just to chill out." and the words "chill out" are what got me.  Would
I be able to 'chill out' in Amsterdam?  No.  What?  Why?  Because I
don't know anyone there.  AAHA!!!  Gotcha.  That's it!</p>

<p>No, I <em>don't</em> know anyone there <em>now</em>, but there are
bunches of cool people all over the world, ready to chill out and swap
stories and share beverages and just have a great time!
Whoooooo!!!!!</p>

<p>I just tried to call Janette to give her this answer to that
previously unanswerable question "what are you afraid of??" but she
wasn't home.  Or no answer at all; they may be on the phone.</p>
