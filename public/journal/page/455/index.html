<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>Driving a car around a block and needing to drop off
Dude and Gene, but at first thinking that I couldn't go but to within
a block of where they needed to be dropped off, but then I realized I
could, so I turned left up this small driveway into a parking lot and
dropped them off.</p>

<p class=dream>They had just helped me carry something in my car to
somewhere or some shit like that.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class=dream>In a neighborhood street and up in a window of a two
story house, a little girl was calling to me for attention.  She and I
didn't know each other, but she came running downstairs with her arms
up like, "pick me up" so I did and I asked her name and she said
"Cinderella" secretly and then "Mindy" as her real name but then went
on to explain why she called herself Cinderella.  I told her that I
understood and she didn't have to explain it.</p>

<p class=dream>I did know her older sister, but didn't get a clear
idea of who she was.  Someone from my college days.</p>

<p class=date>9:21am</p>

<p>I just realized that none of my dreams seem to go backward in time,
like some movies (Momento) or even others that don't go entirely
backwards, but somewhat backwards.  Or maybe they do and I don't
realize it.</p>

<p>Drove Hannah banana to her soccer game, as Lisa would otherwise
have a tight schedule picking up Addie from school and taking Hannah.
The game is "way out" in Bolton, wherever the heck that (this) is
with soccer and football fields bordered by trees on one side and
cotton fields on the other.</p>

<p>Light sprinkle of rain, so light that it's hardly noticeable, with
only infrequent drops hitting my screen.  Oh man I just realized I
forgot to bring a jacket.  Pooh.  I hope I don't freeze too much.
Maybe I'll .. oh wait I have my jacket in the car.  Nevermind.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>They won the game 3 - 1.  At the very end a girl from the other
team hurt her neck severely enough to have an ambulance called for
her.  My blessing to her: "may this be her favorite story to tell her
kids."</p>

<p>Hannah and I chatted a bit on the way up there and back.  Good
stuff.</p>

<p>Tonight was hilarious fun with Lisa and her three girls all at
home.  Addie is the oldest, and the one I know least - she was on IM a
lot tonight.  Hannah, Julie, Lisa and I all played on the trampoline
for quite some time, having the grandest greatest fun ever.  Double
bouncing each other, sharing stories of me and Fred double bouncing
kittens when we were little, playing crack the egg and fry the bacon
and double bouncing the baseball (not a hardball, but made of stiff
foam) and singing Ants and Cheese, plus The Beaver Song and The Walrus
Song, with Kris duly credited for it.</p>

<p>Lots and lots of laughter all through the evening, through dinner
of quesadillas and music of a CD that Addie is burning for her
friend's 16th birthday with Snoop Doggy Dogg, Michael Jackson, and
many others and others.</p>

<p>Addie's least favorie and only and very simple job is to clear out
the dishwasher each night.  She hates it and would be willing to pay
me five dollars per night to do it for her, if she only had that much
money.</p>

<p>Hannah always forgets until the last minute to have her mom sign
things so even after Lisa was all, "do you have anything for me to
sign?" and Hannah was all "no" then later Hannah was all, "oh!  I do
have something for you to sign!"  It was a paper used to indicate in
what language the parents were literate.  Basically Lisa had to sign
to say she knows English.</p>

<p>Julie is the youngest and most enjoyed being double bounced on the
trampoline.  "Do it again!  Do it again!" after she shrieked as I
bounced her high enough off the trampoline for her to stand up.
Excellent fun stuff!</p>

<p>I made a honey/feta/mozarella quesadilla and switched one sixth of
it with a sixth of Addie's.  It was the last one that she chose to
eat, and she immediately noticed.  Funny thing was that she didn't
notice me doing the actual switch even though she was walking back to
the table when I switched.</p>

<p>What an interestingly different life I may have had if only I had
sisters growing up.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>In a library writing html to represent entries in a
checkbook register, I was just hardcoding all the entries themselves,
and then realized that it would be much easier in the long run to
write a template and let the entries be stored in a database and let
the comptuer format them nicely.</p>

<p class=dream>I paced around the library a bit and my laptop power
cord got stuck on the opposite side of a shelf than where I had been
so I untangled it and woke up.</p>

from: gin
subj: Gin in Potes,Cantabria-España

Na-Nu-Na-Nu!  I am occasionally reminded that these electronic mind
blasts are going out to people who do not usually read english, but
never-fear, even some people who do understand my words do not
understand me at all. I hope an underlying feeling comes through. 
Love and rage, fire and earth, wild and wilder...?  I have finally
arrived at the base of yet more incredible mountains.  These are Los
Pecos De Europa, the Peaks of Europe, and my how spectacular...

      My voyage out of the Basque Country was one of those roads that
I got lost on, only because any other road would have taken me in any
other direction than west, where my final destination point rests.  I
took that cow path west instead of north-east.  It ended in the woods
on a mountain side, so on my usual 'don't look back' course, i
continued up the mountain wishing for a mountain road.  I still
reserve the wish list, for it seems most of my wishes come true, so i
choose them carefully, after accepting whatever consequences might
come of it.  Up the mountain, passing a timely water spring leaking
out of the mountain, and to a road!   On the way up the road every car
stopped and asked me if i wanted a lift.  I did not even make it to
the top before a guy stopped and told me there was a refuge at the top
where i could stay for the night.  I made it to the top and was given
a house and a key.  At the top of this sierra (1100 meters) in the
very corner of the Basque Country (i had thought i left) was a village
of sheep herders.  There was even a young woman staying in one of the
cabins.  We all had great laughs, they invited me to stay for weeks. 
I stayed two nights, the second night going down to a town in the
state of Burgos for a fiesta.  It was an excellent way to leave the
Basque Country.  I made a little study of the Basque Country.  Also
trying to find out what is up with the ETA (the terrorists!).  While i
was in Euskal Herria (the greater Basque Country) one of  the
nationalist political parties was illegalized.  Wow, 250,000 voters
illegalized!  Those folks are terminally pissed.  I never got to the
bottom of why that many people think it is more or less ok to kill
innocent folks in the name of independence from Spain.  I was given a
Basque flag, of which i has wished for many years ago.  I now know not
to show it to anyone, less i create more controversy than usual.  I am
fascinated by this part of the world, and the intense history and
culture that has brewed here.

     I am now in my last valley of Cantabria.   I have seen these
"Peaks" for a week or so, at the top of almost every mountain i have
climbed.  From the tops, to the north i can see the Atlantic-The
Cantabria Sea, to the west has been these mountains, and to the east,
every mountain in a easterly direction are the mountains i have
passed.  The people here are of a special breed as well.  When i
crossed from Burgos into Cantabria i met a farmer that was a giant. 
Blonde and almost 2 meters!  I thought, this Viking is no Basque.  Two
days later, and passing a few more with this dramatic build, i was on
a mountain top and I passed a group of archaeologists.  The director
of the project thought i had climbed the mountain to join the
excavation.  When he asked i said, "Sure I did!" I got a tour, saw the
areial photos and photos of the treasures they have found and joined
the group.  It did feel like a cult.  I learned that they were
excavating an ancient dwelling of the Cantabros, the Celtic people
that lived here 2000 years ago (explaining the giants).  The Cantabros
lived on the mountain tops because the valleys are/were too humid. 
Also, the tops are easier to defend.  Yet, unlike the Basques, the
Romans conquered Cantabria, and the mountain tops were remodeled into
elaborate Roman forts.  This one was for a battalion or
two (5000-10,000 soldiers).  I am very interested in pre-roman
civilization, but after a day of digging, and feeling like i was being
assimilated into the circle of 15 "arqueologos", i bowed out and made
my route towards where i am now.  I prefer digging for crystals.  Some
history just slaps me wrong.  The imperialists leave me wondering what
kinds of things they destroyed. My own present imperialist country
included.  I know it is a cycle, and it all has its place, but for
right or wrong, some bones are better left buried, or unslaughtered.

       The Equinox has passed, the falling leaves and cold winds and
rains present different insights.  The mountain roads, like many
paths, lead nowhere fast.  I know i am loved at home, and i look
forward to being there, sometimes it is an echoing longing.  Yet, i
shall not pass this way again.  It is like licking a tootsie-pop
(bon-bon) and searching for the carmel in the middle.  I am not in the
middle, i am on the sweet outskirts.  I have been gifted 5 whiffs of
the most delightful smell of my life, i could not find the flower, so
the mystery remains.  I stop and talk to everyone that wants to talk. 
I answer all their questions, and assure them my fear has nothing to
do with the potential dangers presented to me on this walk.  The
tender good-byes of the people from this area are not to be
forgotten.  There are no good-byes without a list of good wishes to
pave my way with luck and ease.  An elderly woman invited me in her
house this morning for coffee.  She apologized sincerely for not
having fresh cows milk. She recently had operations on both knees.  I
did not have to ask why, a lifetime on the side of such a mountain,
even a year or 3, would take its toll on the knees.  Such love in the
world.  Such suffering to complete the balance.

      The last days it has been raining, and hence foggy.  I climbed
two mountain ranges without being able to enjoy the fruit of my
labor...the view from the top.  It was a great surprise to wake up
this morning and see the peaks right in front of me.  I am on the GR
71(Grande Rondonee or Gran Recorrido= big walking trail).  I have been
on many GR routes, and this has been one of the best.  I look back and
almost everything has been the best, so it is hard to say.  I have
about 500 KM left, possibly less.  I do ask myself everyday if this is
still my way, my time to make this happen.  I am getting to the center
slowly, enjoying the conversations and sensations of every other bar,
of the forests, the animals, the people along the way.  The deer are
mating in the mountains now, and the bucks (the size of horses) groan
all night long.  They sound like suffering cows, sometimes elephants
or wolves.   Yesterday they were not even scared when i walked by, but
among the many fears people try to implant in me are those that the
bucks attack women.  I roll my eyes and fight the fear, with respect.

       Sometime tomorrow evening i will probably walk out of
Cantabria, and into Asturias.  After Asturias is Galicia (the 2
northern provinces). I was told yesterday i walk the distance and with
the same weight on my back as the soldiers in the Roman Legions.  I do
feel like a private in my private army.  Marching along to a song, or
the silence.  I know i have come to the area of the rains, and when it
rains i don't sing my rain song, i figure, 'let it rain'.  I sing my
rain song for the sun, and love the time for what it is, and try not
to look too hard for what it is not.  It will all come.  I hope
someone besides my mother enjoys this long letter.  I sing a song to
you all.  I hope that you can overlook the rudeness of a 'broadcast
mail', and write me back if you want.  Thank you for the messages you
have sent.  Bless you, big hugs and lots of healthy heart beats to
come.   ultreÓa,   gin

<p>Ok, I'm going to take a computer hiatus for a bit, right after I
synchronize my journal and emails.. (I have just caught up on
livejournal, that real life soap opera of all my YRUU peeps (all that
I know of), and read a long article about how the acceleration of
technology is likely to fuck us (humans) up pretty harshly within 30
years as we reach the singularity.)  Actually, I'm not.  Fuck it.  I'm
going to go jump on the trampoline and write some letters, not
necessarily in that order.</p>

<p>Oh, and study Japanese.</p>

<p class=date>5:18pm</p>

<p>Studied japanese while laying on the hammock and bouncing on the
trampoline, both standing and on my back.</p>

<p>Lisa came home a bit early from work; Julie was sick at school.
Not more sick than a quick nap at home could apparently solve.  She
was trampolining a bit with me and we're about to go to her soccer
game in a few minutes.</p>

<p>While bouncing on the tramp on my back, tossing a plastic bottle of
lotion in the air (it's amazing the kinds of things one can think to
do while on vacation), I caught the bottle close to my face and my
thumbnail cut my nose, right on the underside tip, like a booger
scooper slightly off target.  It didn't bleed much, but it still sorta
stings.  I did wash it off.</p>

<p>In the past, I've wondered if I can write japanese characters here
in emacs and then get them to show up correctly on my site.  Let's
see:</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Oh my gosh I don't think I mentioned this from last night.  Over
the past few weeks I've been slightly infatuated with Eminem.  Janette
and i would listedn and listen and listen over and over to Eminem Show
album and I've been listening to a compilation of Eminem Show and
Marshal Mathers LP (I think) since I left Dallas.</p>

<p><em>Anyway</em>, I was talking randomly with Lisa and Hannah last
night and I mentioned Eminem or something and Lisa goes, "oh my
brother in law just made a movie with Eminem."</p>

<p>And I go, "</p>

<pre>








                       (blank look)








</pre>

<p>Really?"</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>"Wait.  Your brother in law just made a movie with Eminem."  My
brain is like, <em>holy shit, that puts me three people away from
knowing Eminem.</em></p>

<p>"What's the big fat hairy deal?" I can hear you asking (actually I
can hear <a href="https://www.livejournal.com/users/saube/">Colleen</a>
saying that).</p>

<p>Have you listened to his lyrics?  So funny and so creative and so
many rhymes!  And such lengual dexterity I've never heard before.
Plus he's hilarious!  And the music ain't too shabby neither.  And,
um, oh very catchy stuff.  I love it.  And I also am really pleased
with him being able to make some fat cash doing what he loves to do.
Just like The Beastie Boys, and they are equally awesome in an
entirely different way.</p>

<p>So I think it would be pretty cool to meet him, or at least to
write him a letter to check in as a fan.  (I've looked for his address
online and found nothing.)</p>

<p class=date>7:07pm</p>

<p>Game is over.  This was the most stressful job I've had while on my
trek.  I was the flag person for this side of the field.  I had to
think for a second each time the ball went out to figure out which way
to point the flag.  Quite traumatic.  Especially when I miscalled a
direction!  D'oh!  It was a subtle hit by the other team so it was
mostly out on the team that I called, but I called wrong.  Sigh.
Fortunately I didn't get paid any dollars, and the fate of the game
was not hinged on that one play.  Our team won 7 to 0.</p>

<p class=date>8:21pm</p>

<p>Oh my gosh.  Random chatting with Lisa and I find out that they
never have homework on Wednesday nights because 80% of the population
is Baptist, and they have church on Wednesdays.  Lisa's kids love it.
Being Unitarian, they don't have church *or* homework on Wednesdays..
Wow!</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>We walked along the river, talking randomness and I called my dad
for his birthday; I sang him Hippo Birdy Two Ewes on his answering
machine.</p>

<p><em>Star Wars: Attack of the Clones</em> was in the local $2
theater, and Lisa hadn't seen it, so we went to see it.  Lisa and I
were half of the people in the theater.</p>

<p>Piled into the hot tub and now it's time for bed.</p>

<p>At Hannah's soccer game with Lisa. Hannah is Lisa's middle
daughter.  Freshman in high school; she's on their junior varsity.</p>

<p>I've also met Julie, the younger daughter.  Addie is the older
daughter; I haven't met her yet.</p>

<p class=date>11:05pm</p>

<p>Hannah's team came in second place in the soccer game.  Score was 1
to 0.  She did quite well out on the field.</p>

<p>After the game, walked with Lisa and Nora the dog.  Then shopped at
Kroger, then tried to download "Winter" and "Cornflake Girl" from
Kazaah to show Lisa what Tori Amos sounds like on piano.  This
computer connection is AOhell dialup so it took forever and failed
before it got 1/2 way through.  Oh well.</p>

<p>I'm going to just wing-it in Hot Springs, Arkansas.  Oh, I guess I
should look up what highway will get me there from Tulsa.</p>

<p class=date>2:50pm</p>

<p>I got a general sense that I can take Muskogee Turnpike to 40 and
go east.  I'm back and the Phillip's house and I'm going to take a nap
before heading out.  Bhillyx is upstairs sleeping as well.  Whichever
of us wakes up first will wake up the other.  At least that's my
plan.</p>

<p class=date>9:45pm</p>

<p>I'm in Muskogee now, going east, according to the nearly full
moon.  The moon is beautiful... oh yeah.   I've driven between 80 and
90 miles tonight since Tulsa (got a bit lost and had to pay a quarter
at Sepulpa to get off the turnpike).  I'm pretty much wide awake and
just driving east on 64 I think.</p>

<p>Lots of God Bless America signage here.  Oh, that reminds me that I
have noticed myself being more polite to people while in Oklahoma.
yes ma'am, no ma'am.. that kind of thing.  Something about my
perception/belief that the culture is more conservative than my usual
haunts.  Interesting.</p>

<p>I'm not on Muskogee Turnpike.  I never found it.</p>

<p class=date>12:46am</p>

<p>Mileage for my trip since Dallas is 638.7 miles.  That means I've
driven 250 miles tonight or so I think.  I'm in Arkansas at a rest
area now to sleep for a bit.  I've been quite wide awake talking to
Wende for the past 30+ minutes.  When we hung up I was still feeling
awake, and then not so perfectly awake so I was going to continue on
but realized I don't have to stay here all night.  I can just sleep
until I'm ready and then go again.</p>

<p class=date>3:40am</p>

<p>Brr.  It's a bit chilly outside.  I'm awake now and about to
continue.  I don't remember my dreams.</p>

<p class=date>3:53am</p>

<p>oh wait, yes I do:</p>

<p class=dream>Running back to the cafeteria area I just dropped off
Wende and Ashley Powell somewhere to let them go to classes and I ran
upstairs with Scottie the Asian Sensation and Adam Lock to get some
ice cream.  There were no bowls, so we grabbed paper plates.  I put
some potato chips down on my plate to add some flavor to the treat.
The ice cream was super easy to scoop since it had been out for a
while.  I didn't get a hugemongous scoop, but a healthy sized one and
plopped it down on the chips.</p>

<p class=date>6:23am</p>

<p>I'm in Hot Springs now.  Just talked to a guy named Bill at the
Comfort Inn who gave me a map and ideas on where I can go see/touch
("but if you put your body in, the federal people will be all over
you.") a hot spring.</p>

<p class=date>7:27am</p>

<p>Welp, here I am at the base of what might be called the Eiffel
Tower of Hot Springs, Arkansas.  It looks to be about 150 feet tall
starting at the top of this hill, with apparently an elevator or
stairs to reach the top.  Six dollars for adults.  So I'm not going to
go up.  They don't open until 9am, so I'm also not going to go up.
The stairs have an emergency exit protected by a fence that certainly
might be climbable, but I'm choosing not to even try since some cat
may arrive soon to open up the tower, and my parking meter time will
expire in one hour.</p>

<p>Oh, the hot spring that I found was less than astonishing, and
might be described as pretty neat.  The waters of Tabacon blow it away
by a million light years.  Granted we paid $150 per night to stay at
Tabacon (not inc. airfare to Costa Rica and taxi to Tabacon) while
I've paid $0.35 to see this hot spring, so I see why this might not
seem as impressive.</p>

<p>I'm pretty much going to leave now and head to Memphis.</p>

<p class=date>10:07am</p>

<p>At another rest area now on I-40.  I'm sitting on a concrete picnic
table in a wooded area.  If a cloud of mosquitoes doesn't find me, I
may take another nap.</p>

<p class=date>11:58am</p>

<p>Ahh.  Nice nap.  I forgot my dream again.  My battery on the
computer says 12%, so I'm not going to wait around a lot to think of
the dream.</p>

<p class=date>1:53pm</p>

<p>Have just arrived at Lisa's house.  First order of business =
shower.  This will be my first since OKC.</p>

<p>I just heard from Tanner, who I was going to meet in Stillwater
today that his brother is in the hospital now (in apparently stable
condition) after his heartrate jumped to three hundred (!) beats per
minute last night.  A shock to jumpstart his heart at the hospital got
him back on human rate instead of humming bird rate.</p>

<p>So I'm going straight through to Tulsa today and will probably hook
up with them in the hospital.</p>

<p class=date>2:30pm</p>

<p>Okay I'm in the hospital, and here's the story as I rememeber it
from Tanner:</p>

<p>Ryan was at a friend's house and ran downstairs to get a pizza
coupon from the car.  When he ran back up he started feeling weird and
started super sweating but felt crazy cold.</p>

<p>He wanted to take a shower before going to the hospital, so he did.
They got him to the hospital emergency room and they were all, "um, we
don't have a room, we're going to put him in the hallway here."</p>

<p>In the hall on a stretcher and they put an EKG on his finger.</p>

<p>"Oh shit!" and then <em>zoom</em> everyone was all around Ryan.
His heart was fluttering and had been for like an hour and a half.
They zapped him and it went basically back to normal.</p>

<p>("Oh shit!" is doctor-speak for "this is bad.")</p>

<p>No concern about brain damage; they think his head got enough
blood, though the rest of his body did not.  His extremeties were 70%
oxygenated (if that's the correct term) while 95% and lower is bad
news.</p>

<p class=date>2:57pm</p>

<p>Ryan adds to the story:  he had been playing football earlier that
day and his heart rate never returned to normal after that.  He went
to work and then to his friend's house.</p>

<p>His friends carried him upstairs and downstairs in a chair.</p>

<p>At the hospital, he was conscious for the defibrulator.  He said it
felt "pretty weird."  It lasted only an instant, but he could feel it
all over his body.  He could immediately feel his heart go back to
normal (from 300 to 75 beats per minute).</p>

<p class=date>7:05pm</p>

<p>I took a big ol' phat nap on the chair that lays out into a bed
while a couple troops of visitors came through.</p>

<p>Tanner and I just dropped off my car at their house and picked up
some taco thing for Ryan to chow.  Visiting hours are over until 8:30
so we're chillin' in the waiting room with the parents and Brent, all
on beds converted from couches.</p>

<p class=message>Hey all..its tanner, rob is letting me give my spin
on things, man its been crazy.  my mom left a message on the machine
in my dorm room around 1:30 am, but i didn't get in till like 3:30,
and i started freaking out, i'd never felt such intense panic before,
if i'd listened to the whole message, i would have learned everything,
but all i heard was "ryan is in icu" so i flipped out and thought he
was in a car wreck or something.</p>

<p class=message>noah and kara drove me up to tulsa this morning, we
slept in a bit, we got to bed superlate</p>

<p class=message>we found out some crazy stuff about ryan and his
wacked out heart, besides that it was going 300 beats a minute (thats
5 beats a second!), when he got to the hospital, his blood pressure
was 30/0..thats crazy bad</p>

<p class=message>well i'm trying to set up ryan's playstation 2 in his
room so he can have some fun, and i rented a bunch of movies and games
for him. well my parents are about to crash, and rob is playing with
some toys that look fun, i think i'm going to go play too</p>

<p class=date>7:25pm</p>

<p>I'm so funny.  I just wrote on the dry erase board designed for
people to leave messages for loved ones:</p>

<pre>
mom & dad
I got out of
the ICU and
I'm running
awaaaayyy!
</pre>

<p>I got that from way back in the day when Astroworld had a similar
board.  Someone had apparently written that to his brother.</p>

<p class=date>7:29pm</p>

<p>Okay, I am typing in dvorak layout.  I haven't practiced this for
some weeks.  The only stinky thing is that this is supposed to be
dvorak - qwerty, which it is except the qwerty part is used with the
apple key instead of the control key.  Maybe I can download a dvorak -
qwerty (control) layout.</p>

<p class=date>7:37pm</p>

<p class=date>8:28pm</p>

<p>Now we just played disc in the parking garage.  We were doing some
tricky throws including skips around posts and under flag lines and
skipping off the ceiling.  Then we did a distance competition, and
each got the disc pretty far down the length of the garage.  Didn't
really measure it, but over a hundred feet, which of course was
excellent considering the low ceiling.</p>

<p class=date>9:33pm</p>

<p>Playing <em>Stuntman</em> on Playstation 2.  I pretty much suck at
it, but Tanner and Ryan are relatively good.  The "director"'s voice
is pretty funny at times.  When we drive the wrong direction, he says
"where are you going?" and when we fall off the dock into the Thames,
he says, "where are you going?" in the exact same way.  Not, "look out
for the water!" or "hey you're not a boat!"  And when flipping up onto
two wheels he just says, "cut, new take" instead of, "hey jack, cool
two wheel drivin' there, mate!"</p>

<p class=date>10:21pm</p>

<p>Ha.  Tanner just got chinese food for himself and me.  My fortune
cookie says, "you will attend an unusual party."  Postcognition?</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class=date>9:21am Sunday 22 September 2002</p>

<p>Saw <em>Blade 2</em> last night, or the last half of it.  That
movie seemed to go on and on forever.  Slept on the fold out couch and
have a sore neck now, I think because the top of the couch-bed raises
up like a pillow would, which caused my head to compress into my neck.
I usually don't use a pillow under my head, but only under my
knees.</p>

<p>I wonder if I could conceivably sleep for a night in the intensive
care unit waiting room of any hospital around my journey...  If I
arrive late enough at night, no one seems to be awake enough to care
who's here or not.  Interesting...</p>

<p>Johnny's 20th birthday party started approximately 12 hours ago.
Sabra was just now swimming in the frigid pool looking for remains of
glass chess pieces thrown by drunken idiots from our 12th floor
balcony.  What a great girlfriend she must be for him.  The sucky part
of the story is that these pieces were from a chess set that Sabra got
Johnny for his birthday last night.</p>

<p>Johnny is sick on his bed, and has missed his Spanish class
today.</p>

<p>The three helium balloons that balanced the weight of a
punch-balloon escaped out the sliding glass door and off the balcony
into the wild blue yonder.</p>

<p>The shopping cart borrowed from Home Depot across the street to
carry party supplies upstairs still adorns the living room.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Last night the peeps on the floor above us were also partying, so
we chatted with them a bit, they peered over the balcony as we leaned
backwards over ours to gaze up at them.  One guy poured beer perfectly
into Sabra's open mouth.  When Becky tried this stunt, she got beer on
her forehead.  Twice.</p>

<p>Sabra, Becky, Mindy all went up there to say HI to that party. On a
whim I climbed the outside balcony from the 12th floor to the 13th
floor, much to the surprise/horror/amazement of those who were on the
13th floor.</p>

<p>We got a knock on the door at 3am for being toooo loud, both music
and hollering on the balcony.</p>

<p>Hunter created a new bright green drink and called it Hilarious
Hunter.  It was Mountain Dew, orange juice, vodka, blue curucao.  I
had a sip.  Tasted like mint to me.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Sabra and Mindy are equally involved in escapades involving Mindy
not being in Arkansas now for someone's wedding.</p>

<p class=date>10:57am</p>

<p>Johnny is up now, asking me to include how it would have really
been a bad ending if I had fallen while climbing up the balcony.
"Would you have screamed if you had fallen?"  I don't think so.  "I
probably would have just said 'fuck'"</p>
