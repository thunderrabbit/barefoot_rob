<p>Akiko and I went to her train line&rsquo;s side of Akihabara, and ate at the
Indian restaurant on the 9th floor of the BIC Camera building.
Bottomless cheese nan seems like a good deal until I eat the second
one!</p>

<p>We talked about her upcoming trip overseas and pets and other stuff I
am too tired to remember, much less write.  Oh, we also talked about
commas and when to use them.  Tough question!</p>

<p>Her Japanese teacher told her to add 、 when she wanted to say ね.
That&rsquo;s as good as most rules I&rsquo;ve heard for commas in English.</p>

<p>These are notes she wrote in the last three lessons.</p>

<p>Today there were only 1.5 students in my Akihabara class.  This number
is down from our high of like 8 last year when I had to stop checking
homework during the lesson because there ended up being no time for
class.  I guess there would be time with just 2 students&rsquo; worth of
homework.</p>

<p>Anyway, the lesson kinda devolved into a China vs Japan debate.  I
should have nipped it, but I was too tired and I kinda thought the
students would sort it out.</p>

<p>Interesting to talk about the Meisner effect and flux pinning at SCC
today.  I have always assumed I understand the meaning based on the
English presentation, but I felt a bit unsure when I was breaking it
down in detail for Yasu as he was practicing his explanation of the
same.</p>

<p>My understanding: when a superconductor is below its critical
temperature it pushes (almost) all magnetic flux out of itself.  This
is the Meisner effect, apparently named after a scientist named
Meisner.</p>

<p>Impurities in the superconductor mean some lines of magnetic flux
pierce the superconductor and the superconductor &ldquo;remembers&rdquo; the
strength and direction of those lines and pins itself to them.  This
is called flux pinning, apparently not named after a scientist.</p>

<p>What is this &ldquo;memory&rdquo;?  I guess while the material is not a
superconductor, magnetic flux pierces it like any other non-ferrous
material.  As it becomes superconducting as it passes below its
critical temperature the flux already passing through it are&hellip; what
exactly?</p>

<p>(( I wonder if electrical resistance in normal conductors is what
causes the magnetic fields???  hmmm ))</p>

<p>Wow Hugo rules.  Thank you, Bep!</p>

<p>I got my journal/ and blog/ indices separated by adding a bit of code
to the pagination.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/purehugo-tr/commit/16559a8ffa3ec74f57af7398a90f259f41972675">https://github.com/thunderrabbit/purehugo-tr/commit/16559a8ffa3ec74f57af7398a90f259f41972675</a></p>

<p>And now the Prev and Next links work based on section.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/purehugo-tr/commit/97b09a88d01a493374ba6231185bf8cb9b723e0b">https://github.com/thunderrabbit/purehugo-tr/commit/97b09a88d01a493374ba6231185bf8cb9b723e0b</a></p>

<pre><code>            &lt;div class=&quot;pager&quot;&gt;
                 {{with .NextInSection}} &lt;a href=&quot;{{.Permalink}}&quot; rel=&quot;prev&quot; style=&quot;float: left!important&quot;&gt;❮ {{.Title}}&lt;/a&gt;{{end}}

with Mai, who saw me as she was walking perpendicular to my path of
travel, focused on a youtube video about teleportation paradox in
Portal.</p>

<p>Max and I met at The Pink Cow where Lin and I were going to meet,
but she ended up heading home instead after work.  After filling up on
world famous bean burritos at The Pink Cow, we walked to Roppongi
Midtown where we spent a considerable amount of time wondering how to
measure if the circular glass window over the white
not-really-egg-shaped stone is round or not.  I ultimately decided it
was not round because the wires inside the glass (which travel at 45
degree angles to the edge) did not bisect the quadrangle shapes,
making them rectangle, not square.</p>

<p>With the tools we had available, I could not think of a way.  The
best I could think of would be to take a string on opposite sides of
the shape and walk around the circumfrence.</p>

<p>Max decided to try barefooting with me so he took off his shoes
and we headed down the escalator and to the white stone to get the
only pictures of the night.</p>

<p>Headed to Roppongi Hills and wandered around on different surfaces
from astroturf to vents blowing air up through the floor.</p>

<p>Went back to Roppongi Crossing and down the bar-crawl street to chat
with the Nigerian guys who invite us into the bar.  Tonight I claimed
I could not afford shoes, and one guy said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s nice to see some
poor people around here,&rdquo; which Max and I decided was a really
funny thing to say/hear.</p>

<p>We ended up going up into a bar for a moment because the guy said it
was free, but bounced after talking to them a bit upstairs.  It&rsquo;s free
<em>if</em> we buy a drink.  Max was like &ldquo;let&rsquo;s bounce&rdquo; so we headed out and
he goes &ldquo;that was scary,&rdquo; citing that they would &ldquo;probably&rdquo; spike our
drinks, etc.  Yeah, it could happen, and would definitely not be my
intended way to enjoy an evening!  I wonder how to protect against
that except pour my own drink or see the bottle be opened.</p>

<p>The next guy said we can go to a real topless bar, but we did not head
up there (it was definitely not free), but I asked if I could come
back with Lin.  He was like &ldquo;yeah sure&rdquo; so I guess it would be okay.
Doubt she would go for it, but could be fun.</p>

<p>Headed home via Nogizaka station where I gave Max a hug and see ya
sometime.</p>

<p>Today I wanted to write an email to AB as a status update on the
upgrade I am doing for them.  The update has been taking longer than
expected, both in terms of the amount of work required and the amount
of time I have not been able to spend on it.</p>

<p>To write the email, I wanted to make sure my plan will work.  I wanna
get their system upgraded to latest LTS version of Ubuntu, 18, Bionic
Beaver.  I have written a lot of tests while upgrading their old PHP
system, but I could not get the test framework to work on Ubuntu 18.
Sigh.</p>

<p>So the email that I hoped I could write in an hour has taken 4 hours
and still ain&rsquo;t finished.</p>

<p>Well, I missed the first day of the month by 3 minutes.  I have been
zoned out in front of my computer longer than 3 minutes so oh well.</p>

<p>Logged 6 hours of work and noticed how much longer it will take.  At
10 minutes per line, and 400 more lines to change that&rsquo;s 4000 minutes
(hopefully max!), but that is just to get rid of a single singleton.</p>

<p>I am tired enough that I cannot do the math in my head.  4000 minutes
/ 60 = 65 hours..  dang that has got to be too much.  5 minutes per
line and we get 32 hours.</p>

<p>Anyway, the main point is that I feel shame for mis-guessing how long
it would take.  But I gotta let AB know the estimate.</p>

<p>I think I will start up their new DB server and use the existing web
server and new DB server for a bit, and then spin up new DB server
with Ubuntu 18.</p>

<p>Today on my way back home from lunch, I saw a construction site which
was overlookable from a pretty steep hill just beside it.</p>

<p>By standing on the guardrail, I could easily have fallen forward over
their fence.  Nice shot, though!</p>
