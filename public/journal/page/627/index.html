<p>Rob,
    Concerning your cat theory, include Maggie&rsquo;s cats in your data
points to see if they fit.  Mixie meows but usually if you talk to her
first.  Mischief and Julius rarely &ldquo;talk&rdquo; but will sometimes.  Let me
know what you think.</p>

<p>Love,
Molly</p>

<p>Cats that live outside Beltway 8 are entirely different and therefore
outside the scope of my theory.  However, the area between 610 loop and
Beltway 8 is even worse to study, because there is some mixing of breeds
and what we call Cross Concentric Pollenation.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s based on where they were born in their most recent of 9 Lives.  Cats
are quite adaptable; their genes mutate slightly on each rebirth, depending
on their geographic location at the time.</p>

<p>But were Wende&rsquo;s cats even born in Houston?  Mixie and Julius are from the
terrible between 610 and beltway 8 sector.  I think Mischief may be the
same.  Do you remember Spencer&rsquo;s meowing habits?</p>

<p>Originally they may not have been born in Houston.  However, Peter is now
on Life 5 after he ate an entire 50 gallon garbage bag.  Tinkerbell is on
Life 4 after she fought Peter for food and he sat on her.</p>

<p>Spencer was from The Sector.  He would meow at seemingly random occassions;
but we eventually discovered it was only when an episode of I Love Lucy was
playing somewhere within a 100 Meow radius.  (1 Meow is the distance King
Chlawdomer, a Meowrovingian King (511-524) could be heard when he meowed on
a calm day.)</p>

<p>I see.  I think the rules must be very complex concerning meowing habits.
Maybe it is one of the unanswerable questions like, &ldquo;How do cats purr?&rdquo;</p>

Subject:    RE: Cat theory</p>

<p>My purring theory is that cats have a major conspiracy.</p>

<p>1)  There is no surefire way to predict when a cat will purr &ndash; as a species
or individually.  The only exception is Peter in whose case we have to say
&ldquo;There is no surefire way to predict when Peter will not purr.&rdquo;  I think
cats purposefully try to mislead us on this matter.  In the same way, I
purposefully wait and plan on when I will be able to trip Will.  In this
way, my attempt will be an unexpected surprise.</p>

<p>2)  Researchers have not been able to determine how a cat produces a &ldquo;purr&rdquo;.
I believe this is due to special quick dissolve hormones.  These are used so
quickly and break down so completely, that the presence of the compound has
never been detected.  These hormones actually act as a sounding board which
air in the lungs &ldquo;bounces&rdquo; off in succession producing a purr with little or
no action in the voice box region.  That is why purring often sounds in
relation to breathing and why it feels like it comes from the chest rather
than the neck.</p>

<p>Some may believe that I am attributing too much intelligence or desire for
subversion to the cat species.  To these people I say, &ldquo;You have never
looked a cat in the face and seen their true nature.  Eyes are the windows
to the souls, and their eyes contain deviousness and deceit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course, all of this is merely a theory since generations of cats have
kept the secret.</p>

<p>p.s. In addition, I think Peter may be the whole key to figuring out how
cats purr.  Unfortunately, we can&rsquo;t bring this up to Wende because she would
be p&rsquo;o-ed if we dissected her cat.  Damn, the cats win again.

<p><p>Tonight I&rsquo;m packing a lot of stuff and Wende had an outburst of
sorts.  I feel like I&rsquo;m blaming her here, but this is my story.  She
said she was scared that our new house would be all junky like my
apartment.  I&rsquo;ve lived like a sloppy bachelor for 10.5 years, not
counting the short periods when one of my girlfriends lived with me.
My apartment is junky.  Clothes are on the floor in the bathroom and
bedroom.  There&rsquo;s a torn sheet covering the recliner.  Dust bunnies
the size of elephants are under most immobile furniture.</p>

<p><p>I got angry and thought about angry things I could do like throw my
couch out the window (<em>CRASH!!</em>), or stab the screwdriver into
the wall multiple times, or just start throwing away boxes that I&rsquo;ve
packed&hellip;  I stuffed my feelings instead of being angry at Wende.  I
curled up in the corner and cried for a bit then made myself get up to
pack more.</p>

<p><p>Wende said it wasn&rsquo;t fair for me to stuff my feelings after she had
expressed hers.  True enough.</p>

<p><p>In telling her my anger I figured out a big reason of why I&rsquo;m
attached to all this stuff.  A lot stems from my dad - he keeps tons
of shit.  He&rsquo;s not the ultimate pack rat, but he&rsquo;s a good pack rat.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m afraid if I throw something out, the person who gave it to me
will be mad that I threw it away.  Or worse yet, that I would forget
that person - that I would forget the <em>story</em> behind the gift.</p>

<p><p>- - - - True Stories - - - -</p>

<ol>
<li><p>See this phone?  Panasonic Easa-Phone model KX-T2130.  Has speaker
phone and 28 number memory.  This phone cost me ten cents.  Ten.  It
works fine.  The speakerphone is kinda squeaky, and the ringer doesn't
ring, and the memory redials don't work, but I can call people and
talk on it just fine.

<p>You know why it cost ten cents?  Cause in 1994 I bought it and an
answering machine for five cents each at a church auction thing.  The
answering machine never worked worth crap.  The phone worked fine at
the time and now it works as well as it does now.  Threw the answering
machine away and the phone has definitely been worth ten cents.

<li><p>See these two passes to an AMC movie?  I got them a couple
years ago at a Christmas party that Sara invited me to for her
American Humanics organization party thing.  The party was small,
starring a bunch of people I didn't know, all winning awards for
achievements that didn't really mean anything to me.  But after all
the awards stuff, we turned on the party music and had a dance
contest.

<p>Sara and I won not for style, not for grace, but for dancing the
damn longest with the most energy out of anyone else there.

<p>The passes are still good.  They expire 31 December 2000.  I intend
to go to a movie with Sara using those passes.

<li><p>See this box of Craft Sticks?  They're just like popsicle
sticks, but they've never been used as such.  My mom bought them for
me in the mid 1980s.  Actually this is probably the second box that I
had.  I have built <em>so much stuff</em> with these Craft Sticks.

<p>Letter holders, CD holders, floppy disk holders, desktop
paper/pen/scissors/tape/glue holders, candle holders, ...  all custom
made for whatever purpose I needed at the time.

<p>Most impressive is my coveted marble track.  Over a period of
essentially 10 years I worked on it.  It guides marbles down tracks
according to their size.  And big marbles flip this little switch
causing little marbles to go down a different track on subsequent
runs.

<p>The marble track is up in the top of my closet, officially
unfinished, but I probably won't really work on it more.  I can't bear
to dispose of it.  I've decided I would sell it for no less than
$5000.  And only then to a home that intends to keep it properly
archived or running.
</ol>

<p><p>Thanks for listening to my stories.  I intend to give away or
probably throw away the phone when we move in a week.  The passes I
will use.  The marble track stays.  Maybe I&rsquo;ll have more stories soon.</p>

<p><p>Back to packing.</p>

<p><p>Doh! One of my website clients, <a
href="https://www.blanketstoyou.com">www.blanketstoyou.com</a>, emailed
me describing a problem with the front page of her website.  When she
views the front page from some search engines, it&rsquo;s different than
when she views from other search engines.</p>

<p><p><em>What?</em> I&rsquo;m thinking&hellip;  That makes no sense.  Complex
scenarios ran through my head - maybe these search engines have cached
old versions of the site and are showing it.</p>

<p><p>Turns out I had made a silly error.  There were two versions of the
front page on her site, in two different directories.  I deleted the
old version and created a symbolic link from it to the new one.</p>

<p class=date>9:53am CDT Sunday 9 April 2000</p></p>

<p><p>I have a new theory about cats.  I have very(!) few data points on
which to base this theory, but here the data:</p>

<p><p>Wende&rsquo;s cats are little meowing maniacs whenever anyone walks into
her apartment, or even near her apartment.  We walk in and they are at
our feet and on the desk, telling us all kinds of things.  Wende can
understand them.  She answers with &ldquo;really?&rdquo; a lot. I&rsquo;m guessing that
Tinkerbell says, &ldquo;I shedded on your pillows and bedspread for you!&rdquo;
and Peter says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Spot, my indoor/outdoor cat is mostly silent.  He comes home
(jumping four feet from tree limb to my bedroom window) walks over the
bed (and anyone who may be in it) to his food dish.  If there is no
food, he&rsquo;ll sit there watching the dish until food appears.  If no
food appears by 3am, he&rsquo;ll jump into bed and ram his head into my face
to let me know about it.</p>

<p><p>The &lsquo;/outdoor&rsquo; part of the description of Spot has recently been
removed.  We have decided to make him an indoor cat when we move to
our new house, instead of letting him in and out, but not Peter or
Tinkerbell.  I figure Peter and Tinkerbell can just get over it, but
we&rsquo;ll see how this new plan goes for a while.</p>

<p><p>When I came home this morning, Spot was meowing, just like Wende&rsquo;s cats.</p>

<p><p>So the theory is either:
<ol>
<li>Outdoor cats maintain vows of silence and indoor cats don&rsquo;t know about this vow.</p>

<p><li>Outdoor cats might become hoarse from fighting other outdoor cats.</p>

<p><li>Indoor cats are just bored and want someone to talk to!
</ol></p>

<p><p>I think the last one is most likely, and I feel bad converting my dear Spot to a bored indoor cat.  :(</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m feeling way better at the end of today, but I certainly was at
work longer than I wanted.  Our phase II of the big project is just at
the 99% complete mark.  We finished the coding today and have to merge
some datasets and then test tomorrow.  We&rsquo;ve been testing all along so
it&rsquo;s not like we think that testing is less than 1% of the job.</p>

<p><p>The big question for me now is, &ldquo;what will I be doing tomorrow at 2pm?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>On one hand is the investment club meeting.  On the other is Eric
and Meredith&rsquo;s wedding.  I have very little interest in a wedding as
formal as I know this one will be.  But they are friends of ours.  I
would rather not miss the investment club meeting (I am the treasurer)
but there is an assistant treasurer.</p>

<p><p>We shall see.</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>Tonight Wende and I met her friends Irene and Nick at Mission
Burritos for dinner.  Actually I met them there late after I <em>finally</em>
got off work.  They are the ones who will be moving to Australia (Nick
is an Aussie) soon.  Wende and I are considering visiting them there.</p>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s been lightning outside lately, and it&rsquo;s been getting closer.  See ya!</p>

<p><p>I caught two points in our ultimate game today!  This is pretty
great because I don&rsquo;t get much disc handling on this team.  One point
was &lsquo;pushed&rsquo; to me (that means there was essentially no spin on the
disc (that means the disc was not spinning) which made it wobbly) and
I actually caught it easily.  The other point was zinged in toward me
and I had to reach one hand out to grab it.  Somehow, it was just a
perfect catch <em>bink</em> and it was caught.</p>

<p><p>We won 13 to 3.  Our defensive setup was good when we played zone
instead of one on one.  I&rsquo;m learning all these ultimate terminologies
and it&rsquo;s pretty fun.</p>

<p><p>Today is so windy!  That actually helped our defense.</p>

<p><p>One amazingly quick almost point I threw just ahead of my intended
recipient, but she just couldn&rsquo;t quite grab the disc.  I think it was
perfectly placed, though.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m choosing to attend the first hour of investment club meeting
and then the wedding.</p>

<p class=date>7:06pm CDT Saturday 8 April 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Investment club was kinda frustrating; only 3 people (including
myself) were there on time.  We decided to begin the meeting anyway.
We got essentially everything done; 8 of 11 people ultimately arrived
by the time I left for the wedding reception.</p>

<p><p>I zipped home and hoped Wende left a message describing the
location of the reception; she had, but only in terms of a restaurant
I had never heard of.  Called her cell phone (the place turns out to
be fairly near my apartment) and dressed up (bluh!) arrived, valet
parked my car cause there was no other option nearby.</p>

<p><p>I saw Maggie and John on the other side of the kitchen area and
walked straight through to them instead of finding the &lsquo;correct&rsquo; way
around.</p>

<p><p>Awright, long story shorter (thank goodness!)..  Our gang all sat
at a secluded table around the corner and laughed a lot.  We sent
Wende up for the boquet toss.  She didn&rsquo;t get it.  They sent me up for
the garter toss.  I got it.  I thought about wearing it as a headband,
but decided against that&hellip;  :-)</p>

<p><p>John and Maggie went home, Molly, Will, Wende and I went for ice
cream at Marble Slab.  Now me and Wende are at my apartment chillin&rsquo;
like Bob Dylan.</p>

<p class=date>8:20am CDT Friday 7 April 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Woke up this morning and my throat feels scratchy, but that&rsquo;s it.
I called Wende and woah - my voice is super wacked out.  Mostly deep
but squeaky if I try any high notes.</p>

<p><p>Part II of our project at work is due today.  I hope to get all my
junk done easily and quickly.  I never can tell with programming,
though.</p>

<p><p>I feel bad that my journals are so lacking this week.  I&rsquo;m just
like, <em>bluh</em> and have no energy.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>Oh wait!  I just remembered the bulk of the dream from when I woke up:</p>

<p><p><em>One of my youth had gotten fired from her job for stating she
needed a day off in 6 weeks.  I said &lsquo;they can&rsquo;t do that&rsquo; and said I
would take her to meet Laura the IT human resources person from my old
work.</em></p>

<p><p><em>We went up an old elevator in some hotel to the ninth floor.
When we stepped out, the ninth floor cubicles had all be pushed away
and there were little kids all playing on the floor - a
bring-kids-to-work nursery had been developed since I left.</em></p>

<p><p><em>I walked towards Laura&rsquo;s office, stepping over some first
graders watching TV.  Laura was in a meeting but the door was open and
I waved at her.</em></p>

<p><p><em>My youth had met some other people who knew how to help her with the original employer problem.  I asked if she was awright.  She was so I left.</em></p>

<p><p><em>This time I went down the stairs, quickly sliding down each handrail, making it to the bottom in record time!</em></p>

<p><p>Then I woke up.</p>

<p><p>Well, I&rsquo;ve been sick and working a lot, which may not be mutually
exclusive activities.  My sinuses are a teeny bit messed up right now, but
getting much better.  The cold seemed to move from my head to my throat
then lungs over a few day period.</p>

<p><p>Yesterday KTRU was blechy.  I just didn&rsquo;t want to talk (even on the air)
because my voice was so scratchy.  I made a joke that I could pretend to be
a deep voiced jazz DJ.  Heh.  For the end of my show, I put on a 35 minute
track and just let it play.  I turned the lights off and lay down on the
station floor.</p>

<p><p>Nancy came in all, &ldquo;hello?&rdquo;  She had been listening as she drove in so
she knew we were on the air, but why were the lights off?</p>

<p><p>I left as soon as she arrived, 15 minutes before my shift would
officially end.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>House purchase and packing is going smoothly.  (I determined that 4 of
my 260 some odd CDs are missing.  <em>Kermit Unpigged</em>, DJ Jazzy Jeff and The
Fresh Prince (either <em>Homebase</em> or <em>And in this corner&hellip;</em>), Nine Inch
Nails <em>Closer Remixes</em>, and one other that I must not care too much about.)
I still have a significant amount to pack; I wish I could pack a box or two
and then move it over, instead of having to pack everything and then move
it all in one day.</p>

<p><p>I gave my landlord notice that I would move out by the end of Sunday the
16th of April.  I paid him <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> rent (pro-rated) at the beginning of April.
 He called me saying that since I only paid half (instead of 16/30ths) I
would have to be out by Saturday night.  Wende said, &ldquo;well, I won&rsquo;t feel
badly about us not cleaning the apartment!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>Tonight I&rsquo;m going to meet Charyl at the UH library to research stocks
and stuff.</p>

<p><p>Have a great day!</p>
