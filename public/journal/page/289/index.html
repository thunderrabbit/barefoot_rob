<p>Hello Family and Friends&hellip;</p>

<p>I am back in the states after my 7 month trip to Southern Mexico where I
spent mid July until December learning from and photographing the
incredible uprising occurring in Oaxaca followed by two months in Chiapas.
In Olympia this week, through photos, video clips, and stories, I hope to
share the spirit and creativity of the teachers strike turned full scale
popular rebellion that managed to take control of the city for multiple
months demanding the resignation of the corrupt state governor, Ulises
Ruiz Ortiz. My presentation will cover the reality that led to the
uprising, the media and government building takeovers, the 1,800
neighborhood barricades, the formation of the Popular Assembly of the
Peoples of Oaxaca (APPO), and the brutal repression and assassinations of
movement members at the hands of paramilitaries and police. Witnessing
this diverse movement in Oaxaca has left me truly inspired and
re-energized. In the face of grave government repression the people of
Oaxaca are continuing this struggle and in great need of international
solidarity.</p>

<p>For those of you in Olympia my presentation will occur twice this week&hellip;</p>

<p>[ email <a href="mailto:rochelle_dates@robnugen.com">ROB</a> if you want deets ]</p>

<p>Please feel free to forward this on to lists and individuals who you feel
may be interested!
Hope to see you there.
Thanks for following my travels&hellip;
with love&hellip;

<p>hello all&hellip;</p>

<p>It has been quite some time since I sent out a report from my time here in
Chiapas. I have been working with Frayba, a human rights organization
that sends internationals into Zapatista and other indigenous communities
to do peace observing work, documenting any threats or actions against the
communities by paramilitaries as well as any movement by the Mexican
military. It has been an incredible experience and I am hoping to spend
two more weeks in a community before I begin the long road home. I was
also fortunate to be able to atten the International Zapatista Encounter
that was held at the beginning of this month. I have included my report
back from that event below. In the middle of February I will be returning
to Oaxaca briefly to say goodbye to some folks and learning about the
latest developments in the struggle. I will then be back in the Northwest
for a couple weeks before flying to Sweden.</p>

<p>I am hoping to do at least one public slide show report back in Olympia in
early March. If anyone would like to help out in coordinating or
publicizing that event or if anyone has further ideas of opportunities for
me to share stories from the Oaxaca struggle, please let me know.
Although Even though the movement has been in hiding and happening behind
the scenes now due to the severe governmental repression, I have truly
been re-energized by the people of Oaxaca and want to share that with my
limited time in the states. The creativity and diversity of tactics,
widespread nature of the mobilization and the creation of an alternative
governing structure are incredibly inspiring not to mention Oaxaca needs
the eyes and solidarity work of the international community now as much as
ever.</p>

<p>As my trip is wrapping up I want to thank you all for listening to stories
from my travels and from all the exciting movement building going on here
in Mexico.</p>

<p>with love&hellip;

<p>Unbreakable Dignity: Report from the Zapatista International Encounter</p>

<p>Prior to the Zapatista uprising, for generations, the 700,000 indigenous
people of Chiapas have lived in oblivion. From the perspective of the
global economy, being neither large consumers or producers, they have been
ignored and simply in the way. The endless appetite of the global economy
has resulted in, according to Subcomandante Marcos (leader of the
Zapatista Army), &ldquo;the destruction of our land, our culture, our collective
way of working, the destruction of our women, the lack of appreciation for
our elders, and the merchandising of our youth. All of this, including
the lack of maintenance of our educational system and the social security
system is for the benefit of the grand capital extranjero [foreigner].&rdquo; On
New Years Day 1994, the first day NAFTA took effect, the Zapatista
National Liberation Army rose up and took over municipalities throughout
Chiapas, birthing a movement which today continues not only to resist the
theft of their resources but is also creating alternative autonomous
governing bodies, schools, clinics, cooperatives and means of
communication. On December 29th to January 2nd the Zapatistas invited
internationals from around the world to come together for an Encounter
between the Zapatistas and the people of the World. The invitation stated
&ldquo;At this encounter the Zapatista communities will speak on the experiences
we have had these past years with our autonomous governments; the
challenges and problems that we have faced constructing this
anti-capitalist project and we will try to, with humility and respect, to
respond, speak and exchange, and above all, share our errors and
stumbling, and also our modest achievements.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Haves and the Have Nots</p>

<p>The gathering took place in Oventic, one of the five caracoles (municipal
seats) of the 32 Zapatista municipalities. On the way to the gathering,
driving through the rural villages one can clearly see that very little
money is making it to these communities. Federal and state government
policies have benefited the foreign investors that exploit resource rich
Chiapas and in turn line the pockets of the politicians and Mexican elite.
With this setup, the indigenous people are losing land and many have been
forced to migrate to the North, relocate to the urban centers or work on
large agribusiness farms to provide low wage labor. Racism from the
government is also clearly at work in Chiapas as shown in the poverty
statistics. In a community where the indigenous population is less than
10 percent, 18 percent of the people are at or below the poverty line; for
municipalities where the indigenous population is between 10 and 40
percent, 46 percent of the people are poor; and for those where the
indigenous make up more than 70 percent of the population, over 80 percent
are poor. The majority of the Zapatistas are Mayan Indians who live in
wood slat and mud houses with dirt floors and do not have running water
even though Chiapas provides close to 90% of the water consumed by the
rest of Mexico.</p>

<p>Encounter Begins</p>

<p>Recognizing the reality most of the Zapatistas live in it is clear where
the fuel came from to ignite this struggle, and yet with access to so few
resources it is hard to imagine what alternatives they could be capable of
creating. On the first day of the encounter thousands of Zapatistas who
attended the conference set up stick structures covered in black plastic
sheeting to sleep in for the duration of the encounter. In sharp
contrast, the 2,000 internationals from 44 countries began to set up fancy
tents. The structure of the encounter included a series of workshops
providing updates on the progress of the autonomous governments, schools,
health care systems, and cooperatives in each caracoles as well as the
struggles for land and for equality for women. I could feel such strong
unity and pride in the Zapatistas who attended the encounter and it was an
incredible experience to sit with them as the leaders they selected laid
out their accomplishments throughout the workshops.</p>

<p>The tactics of the Zapatistas have been extremely diverse throughout the
thirteen year struggle from the initial armed uprising and government
negotiations to the creation of the autonomous communities. The Mexican
government response has been fairly consistent and limited to the use of
force and intimidation mixed with rhetoric and promises never fulfilled.
Even within this climate, much has been accomplished as in achieving
autonomy as highlighted by the workshops. As one of the representatives
explained &ldquo;Because we can not change the world we struggle so that the
world will not change us.&rdquo; Reports from three of the workshops are
included below.</p>

<p>Autonomous Education</p>

<p>From the internationally recognized health clinics to the primary and
secondary schools, many of the communities are receiving services they
never received from the government, often with support of NGOs and
internationals. The Zapatista educational promoters, who are chosen by
their communities to develop schools and train teachers from within the
community, explained that the government schools their children used to
attend were staffed mostly by teachers from the city who spoke only
Spanish. &ldquo;The government schools discriminated against the indigenous
culture, language and traditions of our youth. They did not respond to
our realities in the villages. They prepared our kids for the city, not
to stay in our communities.&rdquo; Many parents decided to pull their students
out of the government schools with the hopes of creating autonomous
schools that &ldquo;teach liberation, not domination&rdquo; and &ldquo;the value of being
not having.&rdquo; Schools have been constructed in all five of the caracoles
and many recently celebrated the graduation of their first class.
Although the teachers are not paid the community provides them with food.
Each region also expressed a lack of resources to train future promoters
and to build new schools. Their eyes lit up as they shared the largest
dream of one day establishing an autonomous university.</p>

<p>Autonomous Governments</p>

<p>The representatives of the caracoles are selected through
their community
for a three year term. They can not run again to give all opportunity for
leadership and to prevent people from becoming disconnected from the
community and power hungry. They too do not receive payment but the
community also provides them with food. Initially when the government
councils were first created they were male dominated but today there are 6
women and 7 men. Although clearly they have the capacity to govern
themselves, the representatives explained that they have faced many
challenges with few resources and villages with great need. The leaders
stressed the huge contrast between themselves and the bad governments,
those who run the state and country. For example, unlike the corrupt
justice system throughout Mexico, the caracol representatives deal with
conflicts by first attempting to find a solution through dialogue and
compromise and if no compromise is reached the one who is found wrong must
complete work to benefit the community, like the construction of a bridge.
Repeatedly the representatives stressed that they &ldquo;lead by obeying&rdquo; and
&ldquo;propose not impose&rdquo; with &ldquo;humility and no self promotion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Struggle for Land</p>

<p>Due to armed uprising in 1994 many wealthy landowners abandoned their
land. The Zapatistas have reclaimed much of this land to work
collectively to sustain their communities. &ldquo;The land belong to those who
work it&rdquo; and &ldquo;to sell the land, would be to sell our mother.&rdquo; Each region
faces different struggles over land. The threat of losing land remains
strong and paramilitary activity continues with intimidation and even the
murder of Zapatista community members. Currently in the Aguazul region the
government is attempting to force a Zapatista community off the land by
the creation of an ecotourist destination, which will also allow the
government to exploit water reserves and other resources. Also the
implementation of neoliberal programs by the government, such as PROCEDE,
also work to destroy the possibility of collectively worked lands. &ldquo;Today
we are living a global offense of exploitation, of being kicked off our
lands, and of a development of politics that will destroy us. The only way
to confront this is by struggling for the impossible, or in other words,
the necessary,&rdquo; explains Sergio Rodriguez from the Zapatista Rebeldía
magazine. The lands that they have recuperated are farmed organically
without the use of genetically modified seed. Agro-ecology promoters have
recently been selected to educate themselves and then their community on
sustainability practices.</p>

<p>Life of Resistance</p>

<p>On January 1st at close to 2a.m. in the morning, Subcomandante Marcos and
many members of the Zapatista National Liberation Army arrived to
celebrate the thirteenth anniversary of the rebellion. The cultural event
lasted for hours with music and dance. In the indigenous language of
Tzotzil, Marcos stated &ldquo;What we have learned on the road of our struggle
is that we could not win unless we united with the people who struggle
everywhere.&rdquo; The Zapatistas need the support of internationals to achieve
their goals in the face of an system that continuously tries to eliminate
them. As they establish stronger and stronger concrete alternatives their
threat to the system grows. The eyes of internationals are critical in
preventing the human rights abuses the Mexican government is notorious
for. We have a long way to go to cross the cultural barriers necessary to
provide the ultimate solidarity but on the last night looking through the
mist out on to the basketball court where thousands of internationals and
Zapatistas were dancing together to traditional music, it felt possible.
As I watched the dancers, many in their early twenties, I realized that
the rebellion began for many of these Zapatistas when they were less than
ten years old, they have truly lived a life of resistance. Throughout the
length of the encounter I was struck by their humble spirit mixed with the
depth of their accomplishments, not only the autonomous governments,
schools, clinics, radio stations, coffee and craft collectives but also
the incredible wealth of beauty in their vision and their unity.</p>

<p>This is the kind of info that was floating around before the war in Iraq that everyone ignored and/or discounted, yet now wished they had not.  This article is damn well-documented too.  if you doubt what he is saying, just click on the links to go directly to the whitehouse website with the quotes he is referencing.  Every American in the country should be <strong><em>required</em></strong> to read this.  People who still have Bush/Cheney&rsquo;04 stickers on their cars should be forced to read this until it sinks in. here&rsquo;s the teaser&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>**This is why the entire debate about the Iraq &ldquo;surge&rdquo; is as much a sideshow as Britney&rsquo;s scalp. More troops in Baghdad are irrelevant to what&rsquo;s going down in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The surge supporters who accuse the Iraq war&rsquo;s critics of emboldening the enemy are trying to deflect attention from their own complicity in losing a bigger battle: the one against the enemy that actually did attack us on <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub>. Who lost Iraq? is but a distraction from the more damning question, Who is losing the war on terrorism? **</p>

<p>By <a href="https://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/frankrich/index.html?inline=nyt-per"> FRANK RICH</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;UNITED 93,&rdquo; Hollywood&rsquo;s highly praised but indifferently attended <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> docudrama, will be only a blip on tonight&rsquo;s Oscar telecast. The ratings rise of &ldquo;24&rdquo; has stalled as <a href="https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/02/19/8400166/index.htm"> audiences defect</a> from the downer of terrorists to the supernatural uplift of &ldquo;Heroes.&rdquo; Cable surfers have tuned out Iraq for a war with laughs: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/23/us/23smith.html"> the battle over Anna Nicole&rsquo;s decomposing corpse </a>. Set this cultural backdrop against last week&rsquo;s terrifying but little-heeded <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/19/world/asia/19intel.html"> front-page Times account</a> of American &ldquo;intelligence and counterterrorism officials&rdquo; leaking urgent warnings about Al Qaeda&rsquo;s comeback, and ask yourself: Haven&rsquo;t we been here before?</p>

<p>If so, that would be the summer of 2001, when America pigged out on a <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> buffet of Gary Condit and <a href="https://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F50A16FA3B550C768EDDA10894D9404482"> shark attacks</a> . The intelligence and counterterrorism officials back then were privately sounding urgent warnings like those in last week&rsquo;s Times, culminating in the President&rsquo;s Daily Brief titled &ldquo;Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S .&rdquo; The system &ldquo;<a href="https://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_Ch8.htm">was blinking red</a>,&rdquo; as the C.I.A. chief George Tenet would later tell the <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> commission. But no one, from the White House on down, wanted to hear it.</p>

<p>The White House doesn&rsquo;t want to hear it now, either. That&rsquo;s why terrorism experts are trying to get its attention by going public, and not just through The Times. Michael Scheuer, the former head of the C.I.A. bin Laden unit, <a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17240518/">told MSNBC&rsquo;s Keith Olbermann last week</a> that the Taliban and Al Qaeda, having regrouped in Afghanistan and Pakistan, &ldquo;are going to detonate a nuclear device inside the United States&rdquo; (the real United States, that is, not the fictional stand-in where this same scenario can be found on &ldquo;24&rdquo;). Al Qaeda is &ldquo;on the march&rdquo; rather than on the run, the Georgetown University and <a href="https://armedservices.house.gov/pdfs/TUTC021407/Hoffman_Testimony021407.pdf">West Point terrorism expert Bruce Hoffman told Congress</a>. Tony Blair is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/22/world/middleeast/22blair.html">pulling troops out of Iraq</a> not because Basra is calm enough to be entrusted to Iraqi forces — it&rsquo;s &ldquo;not ready for transition,&rdquo; according to the <a href="https://www.defenselink.mil/pubs/pdfs/9010Quarterly-Report-20061216.pdf">Pentagon&rsquo;s last report</a> — but to shift some British resources to the losing battle against the resurgent Taliban in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>This is why the entire debate about the Iraq &ldquo;surge&rdquo; is as much a sideshow as Britney&rsquo;s scalp. More troops in Baghdad are irrelevant to what&rsquo;s going down in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The surge supporters who accuse the Iraq war&rsquo;s critics of emboldening the enemy are trying to deflect attention from their own complicity in losing a bigger battle: the one against the enemy that actually did attack us on <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub>. Who lost Iraq? is but a distraction from the more damning question, Who is losing the war on terrorism?</p>

<p>The record so far suggests that this White House has done so twice. The first defeat, of course, began in early December 2001, when we <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/11/magazine/11TORABORA.html"> lost Osama bin Laden in Tora Bora </a>. The public would not learn about that failure <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A62618-2002Apr16"> until April 2002</a> (when it was uncovered by The Washington Post), but it&rsquo;s revealing that the administration started its bait-and-switch trick to relocate the enemy in Iraq just as bin Laden slipped away. It was on Dec. 9, 2001, that Dick Cheney first floated the idea on &ldquo;Meet the Press&rdquo; that <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/vicepresident/news-speeches/speeches/vp20011209.html">Saddam had something to do with <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> </a>. It was &ldquo;pretty well confirmed,&rdquo; he said (though it was not), that bin Laden&rsquo;s operative Mohamed Atta had met with an Iraqi intelligence officer in Prague months before Atta flew a hijacked plane into the World Trade Center.</p>

<p>In the Scooter Libby trial, Mr. Cheney&rsquo;s former communications aide, Catherine Martin, said that delivering a message on &ldquo;Meet the Press&rdquo; was &ldquo;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/25/AR2007012501951.html"> a tactic we often used</a>.&rdquo; No kidding. That mention of the nonexistent Prague meeting was the first of five times that the vice president would imply an Iraq-Qaeda collaboration on that NBC show before the war began in March 2003. This bogus innuendo was an essential tool for selling the war precisely because we had lost bin Laden in Afghanistan. If we could fight Al Qaeda by going to war in Iraq instead, the administration could claim it didn&rsquo;t matter where bin Laden was. (Mr. Bush pointedly stopped mentioning him altogether in public.)</p>

<p>The president now says his government <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/08/20060821.html">never hyped any <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub>-Iraq links</a>. &ldquo;Nobody has ever suggested that the attacks of September the 11th were ordered by Iraq,&rdquo; he said last August after finally conceding that Iraq had nothing to do with <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub>. In fact everyone in the administration insinuated it constantly, including him. Mr. Bush told of &ldquo;high-level&rdquo; Iraq-Qaeda contacts &ldquo;that go back a decade&rdquo; in the same <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/10/20021007-8.html">notorious October 2002 speech</a> that gave us Saddam&rsquo;s imminent mushroom clouds. So effective was this propaganda that by 2003 some <a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0314/p02s01-woiq.html">44 percent of Americans</a> believed (incorrectly) that the <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> hijackers had been Iraqis; only 3 percent had seen an Iraq link right after <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub>.</p>

<p>Though the nonexistent connection was even more specious than the nonexistent nuclear W.M.D., Mr. Bush still leans on it today even while denying that he does so. He has to. His litanies that we are &ldquo;on the offense&rdquo; by pursuing the war in Iraq and &ldquo;fighting terrorists over there, so that we don&rsquo;t have to fight them here&rdquo; depend on the premise that we went into that country in the first place to vanquish Al Qaeda and that it is still the &ldquo;central front&rdquo; in the war on terror. In January&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/01/20070123-2.html">State of the Union address</a> hawking the so-called surge, Mr. Bush did it again, warning that to leave Iraq &ldquo;would be to ignore the lessons of September the 11th and invite tragedy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But now more than ever, the opposite is true. It is precisely by pouring still more of our finite military and intelligence resources down the drain in Iraq that we are tragically ignoring the lessons of <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub>. Instead of showing resolve, as Mr. Bush supposes, his botch of the Iraq war has revealed American weakness. Our catastrophic occupation spawned terrorists in a country where they didn&rsquo;t used to be, and to pretend that Iraq is now their central front only adds to the disaster. As Mr. Scheuer, the former C.I.A. official, reiterated last week: &ldquo;Al Qaeda is in Afghanistan and Pakistan. If you want to address the threat to America, that&rsquo;s where it is.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s typical of Mr. Bush&rsquo;s self-righteousness, however, that he would rather punt on that threat than own up to a mistake.</p>

<p>That mistake — dropping the ball on Al Qaeda — was compounded last fall when Mr. Bush committed his second major blunder in the war on terror. The occasion was the September revelation that our supposed ally, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, president of Pakistan, had <a href="https://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F20B13FA3D550C758CDDA00894DE404482">negotiated a &ldquo;truce&rdquo; with the Taliban</a> in North Waziristan, a tribal region in his country at the Afghanistan border. This truce was actually a retreat by Pakistan, which even released Qaeda prisoners in its custody. Yet the Bush White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/09/20060922.html"> denied any of this was happening</a>. &ldquo;This deal is not at all with the Taliban,&rdquo; the president said, claiming that &ldquo;this is against the Taliban, actually.&rdquo; When Dana Priest and Ann Scott Tyson of The Washington Post reported that same month that the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/09/AR2006090901105.html">bin Laden trail was &ldquo;stone cold</a>&rdquo; and had been since Mr. Bush diverted special operations troops from that hunt to Iraq in 2003, the White House branded the story <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/09/20060910-1.html">flat wrong</a>. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re on the hunt,&rdquo; <a href="https://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0609/20/sitroom.01.html">  Mr. Bush said </a>. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Far from getting him or any of his top operatives dead or alive, the president has sat idly by, showering praise on General Musharraf while <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/16/world/asia/16cnd-gates.html">  Taliban attacks from Pakistan into Afghanistan have increased threefold </a>. As The Times reported last week, now both bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri, are believed to be &ldquo;steadily building an operations hub&rdquo; in North Waziristan. We know that last year&rsquo;s London plot to bomb airliners, like the bus-and-subway bombings of 2005, was not just the work of home-grown jihadists in Britain, but also of Qaeda operatives. Some of the would-be bombers were trained in Qaeda&rsquo;s Pakistan camps much as their <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> predecessors had been trained in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>All of this was already going on when Mr. Bush said just before the election that &ldquo;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/10/20061025.html">  absolutely, we&rsquo;re winning</a>&rdquo; and that &ldquo;Al Qaeda is on the run.&rdquo; What&rsquo;s changed in the few months since his lie is that even more American troops are tied down in Iraq, that even more lethal weapons are being used against them, that even more of the coalition of the unwilling are fleeing, and that even more Americans are tuning out both the administration and the war they voted down in November to savor a referendum that at least offers tangible results, &ldquo;American Idol.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet Mr. Bush still denies reality. Ten days ago <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/02/20070215-1.html">he told the American Enterprise Institute </a> that &ldquo;the Taliban have been driven from power&rdquo; and proposed that America help stabilize the Pakistan border by setting up &ldquo;Reconstruction Opportunity Zones&rdquo; (remember that &ldquo; <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/09/20050915-8.html">  Gulf Opportunity Zone</a>&rdquo; he promised after Katrina?) to &ldquo;give residents the chance to export locally made products to the United States, duty-free.&rdquo; In other words, let&rsquo;s fight terrorism not by shifting America&rsquo;s focus from Iraq to the central front, but by shopping for Taliban souvenirs!</p>

<p>Five years after <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub>, the terrorists would seem to have us just where they want us — asleep — even as the system is blinking red once again.</p>

<p><strong>Letter from Carolyn Ho – mother of Lt Watada</strong></p>

<p>Dear Friends,</p>

<p>On behalf of Lt. Watada and our family, thank you for standing with us during this most difficult time. Because of his refusal to deploy to the illegal and immoral Iraq War, my son now faces a maximum of 6 years in a military prison. The pretrial is scheduled for Jan. 4, 2007.  The court martial is calendared for Feb. 5, 2007.</p>

<p>We are just days away from the pretrial and must broaden his support base. Help us mobilize the local, national, and international community through your personal, professional, religious and other networks. Please forward the attached email alert with a brief explanation. Ask people to go to: <a href="https://www.thankyoult.org/">www.thankyoult.org</a> to learn more about Lt. Watada&rsquo;s case. On the main menu, supporters can click on SIGN PETITION/GET UPDATES AND ALERTS.  They will receive weekly email updates that call for actions in support of  Lt. Watada&rsquo;s stand.</p>

<p>Encourage your contacts to integrate these actions into the anti-war activism they are already doing.  Their voices are critical to building an international public opinion campaign that demands justice and no punishment for Lt. Watada.  His voice of resistance to this heinous war cannot be silenced!</p>

<p>In Solidarity,</p>

<p>Carolyn Ho (Lt. Watada&rsquo;s Mother)</p>

<p>****<strong>Make your 2007 New Year&rsquo;s Resolution to Stand with Lt. Watada Against Illegal and Immoral War</strong></p>

<p>On Monday, February 5, 2007 take action against the Iraq war and in support of Lt. Watada during his military court martial.  Stand up with Lt. Watada and speak out against the illegal and immoral war!******  Join the national movement and organize student walkouts and non-violent demonstrations.  Together let&rsquo;s build a mass movement in the streets, in our schools, and in our communities to end the Iraq War.**  On Feb. 5, 2007 rally at the gates of Fort Lewis, Washington or in your local community.</p>

<p>For courageously standing up and speaking out against the Iraq War, New Year&rsquo;s Eve 2007 may be Lt. Watada&rsquo;s last holiday as a free man until 2013.  While many 28 year-olds are starting their families and building their careers, Ehren will be locked away in military prison for following his conscience and refusing to fight in the Iraq War.</p>

<p>****<strong>Now it is time for you to follow your conscience and join the national movement to support Lt. Watada and end the Iraq war.</strong></p>

<p>As civilians, the responsibility ultimately falls on us to demand an end to the Iraq war.  In fact, we owe it to the soldiers who are fighting and dying in Iraq every day, as well as those resisting the war. We must all stand up and speak out against the war and in support Lt. Ehren Watada!</p>

<p>Currently, the Bush Administration is planning to deploy 30,000 more U.S. troops to Iraq, yet the overwhelming majority of Americans oppose the Iraq war. Since 2003 the war has cost 3,000 U.S. soldiers&rsquo; lives, approximately 950,000 Iraqi deaths, 2 trillion U.S tax dollars or approximately 8 billion dollars a week. We can no longer stand by and continue to allow this great injustice to occur!</p>

<p>__<em>&ldquo;My fellow soldiers are fighting and dying in Iraq and their families are suffering because of the lies and deceptions crafted by the Bush Administration.  The Iraq war is not only a crime against domestic and international law but [it] is a terrible moral injustice against the Iraqi people.&rdquo;  Lt. Ehren Watada</em></p>

<p>As the first Army officer to publicly speak out against the war and refuse deployment to Iraq, Lt Watada will be punished by the U.S. Army with a maximum six years in prison.****** The military&rsquo;s intention IS to SILENCE VOICES OF RESISTANCE and make an example out of Lt. Watada.**</p>

<p>Lt. Watada&rsquo;s bold actions have raised the consciousness of thousands of Americans about the illegality and immorality of this war, but his actions alone will not stop the Iraq war.  If Lt. Watada is willing to sacrifice his freedom, then we, too, must voice our opposition and take action to end the war.</p>

<p>****<strong>Take Action Feb. 5, 2007 during Lt. Watada&rsquo;s military court martial and make your 2007 New Year&rsquo;s Resolution to Stand with Lt. Watada Against Illegal and Immoral War.</strong></p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;m losing it&hellip;seriously&hellip;i think I&rsquo;m forgetting the meaning of words like &ldquo;peace&rdquo; and &ldquo;ceasefire&rdquo; and &ldquo;routine&rdquo;. Today I had a day off and went to meet a friend of mine from Bethlehem who has recently started a new job with UNESCO in Ramallah. We met for a long lunch and then went shopping in Ramallah&rsquo;s busy town centre. Then the army arrived. Bulldozers first, shunting parked cars out of the way, some into shop fronts. Close behind were the armoured jeeps. No announcements: tear-gas, then sound grenades, then live fire. A helicopter above, backing up he ground troops with overhead fire. We were caught so unaware that I have to admit we both panicked and fled with other shoppers, young and old into the nearest store. We flinched and held hands with every gunshot and explosion from the other side of the metal shutters. .</p>

<p>Of course, we needn&rsquo;t have worried. This was just a &ldquo;routine arrest operation&rdquo;. So tell me, am I losing it? Have I been here too long? What exactly is routine about four dead people and twenty seriously injured? Routine to me was mothers and children, on holiday from school, going about their business, buying food and clothes, meeting friends for lunch&hellip;.right?</p>

<p>Today in Palestine: Ramallah raided, Bethlehem raided, Tubas raided, two villages close to Bethlehem raided, four dead, 35 injured, 9 arrested, so far. But Israel wants only peace and to protect <em>itself</em> from terrorists. A new colony approved in the West Bank to house the illegal Israeli &ldquo;settlers&rdquo; removed from the Gaza strip; 55,000 new Israeli houses to be built on land stolen from the village I volunteer in, the village that now has an unemployment rate of around 75%&hellip;.peace?</p>

<p>Like I say, i really think i&rsquo;m losing it, I hear the words Israel speaks but my eyes won&rsquo;t let me believe them&hellip;anyone any advice for a confused girl?</p>

<p>Regarding WiFi in Japan vs the US, Jesse wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We already have 4G in Japan&hellip;. and it is already too slow but boasts speeds of 100mbps.
3g is only good for non-mobile systems. It only goes a max of 384kbps for mobile systems, and that is if it has a good connection&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dude explained:</p>

<p>beacause the US is so concerned with &ldquo;preserving the free market&rdquo;, our
government refuses to mandate a standard. Therefore, we have
competing standards and no one wants to risk buying and deploying the
wrong standard. In addition, we have a state (and federal)
legislature that is woefully ill-prepared for considering such issues,
and they have been swindled by the telecom industry who has lobbied
them to believe that making it illegal for municipalities to deploy
free WiFi networks is in the public interests. It is argued that the
public sector is inherently ill-equipped to handle such a high-tech
utility and will ultimately result in mismanagement and excessive
taxpayer expense. Of course the truth is that huge telecom copmanies
like AT&T; (Formerly SBC), Verizon, Time Warner, etc. want to force
people to buy WiFi and they conjure up these tortured arguments so
that they can make more money at the expense of progress. The result
is that Japan has 4G WiFi all over the city and in subways and other
difficult areas, and that most major cities in the US have spotty
cellular service for which people pay through the nose, and no free
WiFi. Isn&rsquo;t laissez faire capitalism awesome!?!?</p>

                        <p>##11:08 Friday 15 December 2006</p>

<p>Hello all&hellip;</p>

<p>So I have been experiencing some sort of writers block.  I had intended to
send this update last week but ended up needing some time to reflect and
decompress.  The repression by the Mexican government that I described on
the 25th has continued.  On October 29th the government leaked that they
had compiled a list of 100 internationals from video footage who they
alleged were committing vandalism alongside the movement and who they
intended to deport.  I am not sure I believe such a list exists (not to
mention I have never seen close to 100 internationals in Oaxaca), it may
have simply been a fear tactic but mixed with the news that they had
picked up a french woman and her lawyers were unable to speak to her or
find out where she was, I decided it was best to go.  I had been in Oaxaca
for so long and I don&rsquo;t exactly blend in and I did not want to risk
deportation, not to mention rape and torture.  If I had stayed I would
have been stuck in my apartment and decided I could do more just as much
writing from a far.  So now I am in San Cristóbal Chiapas and looking
forward to attending an international encounter planned by the Zapatistas
at the end of this month.  Then I hope to spend the last month and a half
doing volunteer work in the Zapatista villages in the jungle.  On the way
home I will stop in Oaxaca to say goodbye to many folks and check in with
the situation.  I will be in the Olympia/Portland area for two weeks the
end of February through early March and would love to do a slide show and
reportback of the Oaxaca struggle if anyone is willing to help me find a
space and do a bit of publicity.  Let me know if you are interested. Ok,
enough about me.  On to the current situation&hellip;</p>

<p>There have been over 500 people detained, many tortured by the government
throughout the 6 months of this struggle.  Currently there are over 200
imprisoned, over 100 of them have been transferred to federal prison in
states outside Oaxaca.  Stories coming out of these prisons include
stories of torture, 60 reports of sexual assault, rape threats and forced
confessions.  There are still many outstanding arrest warrants for members
of APPO.  Because one of the major goals of APPO has been to create a
democratic governance structure, they have been highly transparent and the
names of those involved and elected as representatives of various regions
are easily found in meeting minutes and online.  This has made it easy for
the government to target those involved in the movement.  The police have
made numerous private home searches and have taken teachers from in front
of their students in their classrooms (in front of children as young as
kindergardeners).  Governor Ulises himself recently acknowledged that up
to 80% of those detained on the 25th were not associated with APPO but
were concerned citizens in the streets.</p>

<p>On December 1st, Felipe Calderon from the conservative PAN party who took
the election through fraud was inaugurated.  Thousands gathered outside
before dawn, constructing barriers to prevent Calderon&rsquo;s entrance into the
Chamber of Deputies.  Inside brawls had broken out between member of the
PAN and PRD (the party of leftist Lopez Obrador who was cheated out of the
position) parties.  Chairs had been thrown, doors blockaded, pillows were
handed out the members of the different parties had fought over sleeping
on the platform where the inauguration was to take place.  A fake
presidential convoy was used to distract the demonstrators while Calderon
snuck in through basement parking garage.  The entire ceremony took less
than 4 minutes and it was impossible to hear over the screaming from PRD
members.</p>

<p>Calderon was able to give a speech later in a military installation.  I
watched on television as he spoke to an audience of men in uniform
standing in formation.  Oh democracy.  In less that a month he has already
made cuts to education and has created a cabinet including Francisco
Javier Ramírez Acuña as his Interior Minister, in charge of domestic
security. Ramírez, past governor of Jalisco, was accused by Amnesty
International of serious human rights violations, including ordering a
brutal crackdown on anti-corporate globalization protesters. Eduardo
Medina Mora was selected as Secretary of Public Safety. He has strong ties
to banking interests and is a member of El Yunque, an ultraconservative
group similar to the Christian right in the states. Making his policy
clear in dealing with social uprising, on December 4th members of APPO
including two highly visible elected reps were arrested in Mexico city two
hours after announcing they had come to negotiate with the federal
government.</p>

<p>On December 3rd APPO released a declaration stating&hellip; &ldquo;The APPO is more
alive than ever in the hearts of the workers, indigenous people,
campesinos, housewives, students, youth, children, and all the exploited
and oppressed in Oaxaca and Mexico. The State Terror that has been
unleashed on the people of Oaxaca and the international community with
increased brutality since November 25 has not weakened our desire to be
free men and women.&rdquo;  A march was held on December 10th.  Even in the face
of the incredible risk of being arrested and tortured tens of thousands
marched calling for the release of prisoners and continuing the call for
Governor Ulises to go.  The march was led by families of the disappeared,
representatives of APPO and senators from Lopez Obradors PRD party.</p>

<p>The movement has taken a huge blow through the fierce repression but the
logic that you can simply wash over a movement with fresh paint and jail,
disappear and torture its members without acknowledging the root cause of
the unrest shows the barbaric and shortsightedness of the government
strategy to deal with this movement.  So much of this response is created
through pressure from the United States to maintain the status quo to keep
the positive climate for foreign investors to come in and take the
resources and exploit the labor of Mexico without opposition from the ever
growing poor, which in turn keeps the pockets of the Mexican elite lined
with dollars.  This corruption and repression is facing greater and
greater resistance and we can recognize our own role in the situation and
support the movement however we deem possible.  The Zapatistas have called
for an International Day of Action on December 22nd in solidarity with
people of Oaxaca.  I will include that declaration below.</p>

<p>Thanks for listening and keeping the people of Oaxaca in your minds&hellip;

<p>December 2 of 2006</p>

<p>To the people of Mexico:
To the people of the world:</p>

<p>Brothers and Sisters:</p>

<p>The attack that our brothers, the people of Oaxaca suffered and suffer
cannot be ignored by those who fight for freedom, justice and democracy in
all corners of the planet.</p>

<p>This is why, the EZLN calls on all honest people, in Mexico and the world,
to initiate, starting now, continual actions of solidarity and support to
the Oaxacan people, with the following demands:</p>

<p>For the living reappearance of the disappeared, for the freedom of the
detained, for the exit of Ulises Ruiz and the federal forces from Oaxaca,
for the punishment of those guilty of torture, rape and murder.</p>

<p>We call to those in this international campaign to tell, in all forms and
in all places possible, what has occurred and what is occurring in Oaxaca,
everyone in their way, time and place. We call for these actions to come
together in a worldwide mobilization for Oaxaca on December 22, 2006.</p>

<p>The people of Oaxaca are not alone. We have to say so and demonstrate it,
to them and to everyone.
Democracy!
Freedom!
Justice!</p>

<p>Hi everyone,
It&rsquo;s been a while since my last mass email and I&rsquo;ve had a couple of
those &ldquo;are you still alive&rdquo; emails that I love as they prove to me
that you all miss me (ie they&rsquo;re good for my ego!) and make me laugh!
I have to say that I&rsquo;ve started writing this email a few times, but
every time I&rsquo;ve given up as the words seemed a little empty. The past
few weeks in my new home have been, typically, both great and heart
breaking. I&rsquo;m now working in the village Walajah that i emailed you
all about a few weeks ago. It&rsquo;s great to be part of such a small,
close community, and as such I&rsquo;m having to walk up all of the steep
hills around here to work off all of the food I&rsquo;m being fed at every
opportunity! It can be so quiet and peaceful here, that it&rsquo;s easy to
forget about the &ldquo;situation&rdquo; (as everyone here calls it!), and think
that i&rsquo;m living in some pretty Mediterranean town (which I am).
However,  and there&rsquo;s always a however, in the past week and a half
there&rsquo;s been three incursions by the army.
The first was to demolish a building and a house. After much arguing,
a local lawyer prevented the home demolition, but the outbuilding was
destroyed.
The second was in the early hours.The army came and forced a family
out of their home with tear gas and sound grenades. They then forced
the father of the family to strip to his underwear in the freezing
cold and lay on the ground before arresting him. His crime? He works
for an orphanage in Bethlehem that is supported by the social services
part of Hamas. He is still detained. His teenage daughter who I&rsquo;ve
been helping with her english homework was too upset to attend an exam
last week.
The third is the one that always gets me. Two days ago the home of
Monder Hamad was demolished for the second time this year, to make way
for &ldquo;the wall&rdquo; deemed illegal by the International court. So this is
my problem: witnessing this was one of the most traumatic points of my
life, and this isn&rsquo;t my house, my village or even my country. How can
i scrape together the words to describe how heart breaking it is to
watch such a personal injustice occur? A family torn apart by well
armed teenagers with all of the power, friends and family kept away
unable to offer comfort. A few of us able to help the family empty
their lives out onto the street before&hellip;. Even as I write it now it
seems empty. The soldier&rsquo;s reply to the desperate question: &ldquo;where
shall we live?&ldquo;&hellip;.&ldquo;We gave you a tent last time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So do me a favour, think about how this would make you feel, spare us
a thought over the holidays, and next time you hear about Hamas
refusing to recognise Israels right to exist bear in mind the
continuous humiliations and tragedies inflicted on every Palestinian:
man, woman and child.</p>

<p>Good-oh-my-gosh-it&rsquo;s-cold-here-evening from Canada:</p>

<p>So the twins have safely arrived in Toronto!!!!  We had quite a
flight to say the least!!   Maria managed to get her visa for Canada
exactly 6 hours prior to take-off. Check-in became a complete debacle
when the ground staff told us that two of our boxes were .5 kilograms
over and would need to be repacked.  Luckily the pilots for our flight
were checking in at the counter beside us&hellip;and offered to carry onto
the plane&hellip;the seven packages of Pokari Sweat powder and the one book
that was causing the extra weight.  It wasn&rsquo;t until we were well in
the air that Maria decided to tell the pilot&hellip;he had just carried
seven packages of white powder onto an international flight for a
Colombian&hellip;we all had a good laugh about that &hellip;.later!!!</p>

<p>Anyway&hellip;we arrived to Canada to minus 1 weather ..and light
snow&hellip;it all looked so pretty until the doors of the airport opened
and Maria refused to leave.  To make a long story short I did manage
to get her out of the airport, into the car and at my new house.</p>

<p>Yesterday we went to go out for a walk and I could see Maria
struggling with her winter jacket..and then she informed me&hellip;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
sure how to manage this system (aka- the zipper)&hellip;.after she took off
her three pairs of gloves&hellip;&ldquo;the system&rdquo; worked much better!!  But
then she informed me that it was difficult to see all her curves under
so many layers&hellip;I told Canadians have never been known for their
sex-appeal&hellip;and to add another layer!!!  She&rsquo;s getting better day by
day!!!</p>

<p>Anyway..just a quick note to say hello to everyone and that we have
arrived safely. This cold Canadian weather has been a bit of a shock
to our systems&hellip;.but the Baileys and hot chocolates are working
wonders!!!</p>

<p>Love and hugs and peace and icicles,
Carla and Maria</p>

<h3 id="pirates-of-the-mediterranean">Pirates of the Mediterranean</h3>

<p>By ROBERT HARRIS</p>

<p>Kintbury, EnglandIN the autumn of 68 B.C. the world&rsquo;s only military superpower was dealt a profound psychological blow by a daring terrorist attack on its very heart. Rome&rsquo;s port at Ostia was set on fire, the consular war fleet destroyed, and two prominent senators, together with their bodyguards and staff, kidnapped.The incident, dramatic though it was, has not attracted much attention from modern historians. But history is mutable. An event that was merely a footnote five years ago has now, in our post-<sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> world, assumed a fresh and ominous significance. For in the panicky aftermath of the attack, the Roman people made decisions that set them on the path to the destruction of their Constitution, their democracy and their liberty. One cannot help wondering if history is repeating itself.</p>

<p>Consider the parallels. The perpetrators of this spectacular assault were not in the pay of any foreign power: no nation would have dared to attack Rome so provocatively. They were, rather, the disaffected of the earth: &ldquo;The ruined men of all nations,&rdquo; in the words of the great 19th-century German historian Theodor Mommsen, &ldquo;a piratical state with a peculiar esprit de corps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Like Al Qaeda, these pirates were loosely organized, but able to spread a disproportionate amount of fear among citizens who had believed themselves immune from attack. To quote Mommsen again: &ldquo;The Latin husbandman, the traveler on the Appian highway, the genteel bathing visitor at the terrestrial paradise of Baiae were no longer secure of their property or their life for a single moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What was to be done? Over the preceding centuries, the Constitution of ancient Rome had developed an intricate series of checks and balances intended to prevent the concentration of power in the hands of a single individual. The consulship, elected annually, was jointly held by two men. Military commands were of limited duration and subject to regular renewal. Ordinary citizens were accustomed to a remarkable degree of liberty: the cry of &ldquo;Civis Romanus sum&rdquo; — &ldquo;I am a Roman citizen&rdquo; — was a guarantee of safety throughout the world.</p>

<p>But such was the panic that ensued after Ostia that the people were willing to compromise these rights. The greatest soldier in Rome, the 38-year-old Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (better known to posterity as Pompey the Great) arranged for a lieutenant of his, the tribune Aulus Gabinius, to rise in the Roman Forum and propose an astonishing new law.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pompey was to be given not only the supreme naval command but what amounted in fact to an absolute authority and uncontrolled power over everyone,&rdquo; the Greek historian Plutarch wrote. &ldquo;There were not many places in the Roman world that were not included within these limits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pompey eventually received almost the entire contents of the Roman Treasury — 144 million sesterces — to pay for his &ldquo;war on terror,&rdquo; which included building a fleet of 500 ships and raising an army of 120,000 infantry and 5,000 cavalry. Such an accumulation of power was unprecedented, and there was literally a riot in the Senate when the bill was debated.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, at a tumultuous mass meeting in the center of Rome, Pompey&rsquo;s opponents were cowed into submission, the Lex Gabinia passed (illegally), and he was given his power. In the end, once he put to sea, it took less than three months to sweep the pirates from the entire Mediterranean. Even allowing for Pompey&rsquo;s genius as a military strategist, the suspicion arises that if the pirates could be defeated so swiftly, they could hardly have been such a grievous threat in the first place.</p>

<p>But it was too late to raise such questions. By the oldest trick in the political book — the whipping up of a panic, in which any dissenting voice could be dismissed as &ldquo;soft&rdquo; or even &ldquo;traitorous&rdquo; — powers had been ceded by the people that would never be returned. Pompey stayed in the Middle East for six years, establishing puppet regimes throughout the region, and turning himself into the richest man in the empire.</p>

<p>Those of us who are not Americans can only look on in wonder at the similar ease with which the ancient rights and liberties of the individual are being surrendered in the United States in the wake of <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub>. The vote by the Senate on Thursday to suspend the right of habeas corpus for terrorism detainees, denying them their right to challenge their detention in court; the careful wording about torture, which forbids only the inducement of &ldquo;serious&rdquo; physical and mental suffering to obtain information; the admissibility of evidence obtained in the United States without a search warrant; the licensing of the president to declare a legal resident of the United States an enemy combatant — all this represents an historic shift in the balance of power between the citizen and the executive.</p>

<p>An intelligent, skeptical American would no doubt scoff at the thought that what has happened since <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> could presage the destruction of a centuries-old constitution; but then, I suppose, an intelligent, skeptical Roman in 68 B.C. might well have done the same.</p>

<p>In truth, however, the Lex Gabinia was the beginning of the end of the Roman republic. It set a precedent. Less than a decade later, Julius Caesar — the only man, according to Plutarch, who spoke out in favor of Pompey&rsquo;s special command during the Senate debate — was awarded similar, extended military sovereignty in Gaul. Previously, the state, through the Senate, largely had direction of its armed forces; now the armed forces began to assume direction of the state.</p>

<p>It also brought a flood of money into an electoral system that had been designed for a simpler, non-imperial era. Caesar, like Pompey, with all the resources of Gaul at his disposal, became immensely wealthy, and used his treasure to fund his own political faction. Henceforth, the result of elections was determined largely by which candidate had the most money to bribe the electorate. In 49 B.C., the system collapsed completely, Caesar crossed the Rubicon — and the rest, as they say, is ancient history.</p>

<p>It may be that the Roman republic was doomed in any case. But the disproportionate reaction to the raid on Ostia unquestionably hastened the process, weakening the restraints on military adventurism and corrupting the political process. It was to be more than 1,800 years before anything remotely comparable to Rome&rsquo;s democracy — imperfect though it was — rose again.</p>

<p>The Lex Gabinia was a classic illustration of the law of unintended consequences: it fatally subverted the institution it was supposed to protect. Let us hope that vote in the United States Senate does not have the same result.</p>
