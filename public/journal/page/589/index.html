<p><p>I&rsquo;ve been at a work related conference for 2 days, and had a ton of
emails that I&rsquo;ll need to process when I get in.  It&rsquo;s a big backlog so
I&rsquo;m going in early to get a &ldquo;head start&rdquo; before the business day
really begins today.</p>

<p><p>I took a bunch of notes on my Visor, and hope to get them online
today as well.  If I don&rsquo;t, know that I am crazy busy at work.</p>

<p><p>lunch was yummy.</p>

<p><p>the class i attended for 2 hours taught a lot of cool stuff about the SAS
version 8 interface for Windows.</p>

<p><p>Mostly he just went through all the menu items and showed what everything
does.  quite basic, but some cool stuff hidden in there.</p>

<p><p class=date>12:40 pm</p>

<p><p>We will hopefully be leaving around 2pm.  Dave is meeting a friend for
lunch and should be back by then.  None of us see anything that looks
particularly interesting later in the schedule.</p>

<p><p>If we zip home at 2, I can transfer this to my website and then have Miss
Wende pick me up at my work on her way home from her work.</p>

<p><p class=date>1:09 pm</p>

<p><p>Kevin wants to attend the closing at 3:30pm so we are staying longer than
I wanted.  So I&rsquo;m at the next Destiny sponsored training class, &ldquo;Alternative
ways to lookup stuff&rdquo; or something like that.</p>

<p><p class=date>2:55 pm</p>

<p><p>I just met Dana, who I have a great deal of respect for after watching
him teach 4 or  different classes.  He said I seemed to have a clue with all
my questions and comments and he asked if I was interested in possibly doing
some contract programming.  I told him I haven&rsquo;t done any, but didn&rsquo;t
dismiss the possiblity.</p>

<p><p class=date>3:25 pm</p>

<p><p>Closing session:  blah blah blah balh balha blha blha blah blah blah bla
blah blab blah blahblahblahblablahblhablhablabh</p>

<p><p class=dream>Earlier in the night I had variations of dreams that I was
able to go  home to be withWende tonight instead of sleep at the hotel.</p>

<p><p class=date>2:59 am Tuesday 24 October 2000</p>

<p><p class=dream>flying upward with self powered rocket engines, I was able to
go up and up and threw a tennis ball up even higher and was able to fly
myself up higher to catch it.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I found a limit to how high I could fly - I was unable to fly
to where the atmosphere was icy; I only flew about 2 miles away from the
earth&rsquo;s surface.I</p>

<p><p class=dream>I fell all the way down and  though I was 2 miles up, it only
took a few seconds to fall all the way.  I even did a spread eagle thing
like skydivers do.  I fell all the way to earth so that my butt barely
grazed the grass (not lierally) and I rocketed myself back up again.  This
time I was less able to control my flight.</p>

<p><p class=dream>My flying was a result of trying to fly away from the bad
guys, who were mad at my brother for some reason; he was in trouble o
something, and I was flying away from them</p>

<p><p class=dream>over a large field like a football field.</p>

<p><p class=date>3:14 am Tuesday 24 October 2000</p>

<p><p>Last night I read Exodus chapters 1-15 for about an hour and then slept.
Wende called and Mosch called, saying he got my message for Karen.  I was
basically too tired to say anything useful in those conversations.</p>

<p><p>Sally drove me to the hotel and dropped me off around 12:15am.</p>

<p><p>such incredible fun beats we beat on the makeshift drums ad I had such a
blast!!  We did talking drums, where one does a beat and the other responds
with any beat back, we squeaked the drums, tapped, slid, rubbed, wubbled,
slorched, kellipped and played for a couple hours.  Way way fun.</p>

<p><p>At the hotel the front desk clerk said she could&rsquo;nt give me a key unless
Dave or Kevin called from the room and said it was okay.  <em>Why can&rsquo;t you
just call them?</em> I&rsquo;m thnking.</p>

<p><p>I called them (actually she patched me through) and David said they had a
key, so I was like fuckit I&rsquo;ll jst go up.  Pooey customer service from the
clerk.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>Slept beside Dave in the bed and it was weird a little bit.  I had the
urge to cuddle, but with Wende; not Dave.</p>

<p><p>I woke up several (4 ?) times with various dreams, but dind&rsquo;t write them
down.</p>

<p><p>7am the phone wake up came and I bounced out of bed.  No &ldquo;hotel soaps&rdquo; in
the shower except for some nice looking Neutrogena in boxes;; I dind&rsquo;t use
those, but just scrubbed with the washcloth my shampoo all over me.  Close
enough to clean for me.</p>

<p><p>My batteries are low now; I&rsquo;ll need to get new ones before I can finish
this two day conference.</p>

<p><p>Welcome to SAS blah blah blah blah blah.  I bought new batteries but
haven&rsquo;t put them in yet.</p>

<p><p>We each got a bag with short handles, and a squishy ball and pen and big
procedings manual and a bunch of boring crap <em>except</em> for a little
thread kit with a needle on each color of thread!  I can use it to sew the
front button of my shorts on better.</p>

<p><p>Most astonishingly left brained conference I could attend.  .  describing
analytical processes, data mining, data warehousing.  wow</p>

<p><p class=date>8:44 am</p>

<p><p>blah blah blah</p>

<p><p class=date>9:01 am</p>

<p><p>I sat with the proceedings book and read a bit of ridiculously
difficult-to-read code.  I randomly walked a bi until I found either the
Cedar room or the Cypress room. I found Cedar, I think.</p>

<p><p>At this session, he&rsquo;s talking about Enterprise Guide.</p>

<p><p>My shoulders and neck feel stiff and sore.  I think that&rsquo;s a result of
waterskiing on Saturday, plus sleeping not in my own bed the past two
nights.</p>

<p><p class=date>9:47 am</p>

<p><p>Enterprise Guide seems pretty cool.</p>

<p><p class=date>9:59 am</p>

<p><p>Ah.  Potty break and now I&rsquo;m in The Learning Center.  This is more like
it.  30 or so laptops so we can learn by doing.  I get very little by
listening to lecture.  hands on is where it&rsquo;s at for me.</p>

<p><p>No Internet access though, so I won&rsquo;t be writing a journal entry online
in realtime.</p>

<p><p class=date>11:37 am</p>

<p><p>This instructor has been cool.  Good at taking a bit of harassment.  I
wasn&rsquo;t able to get a grander solution to one problem that I&rsquo;ve tried to
solve at work.</p>

<p><p class=date>1:10 pm</p>

<p><p>Lunch was yummy and filling.  chicken with hollow noodles.  I sat by a
woman from Dallas who works at a community college.</p>

<p><p>Randomly chose this next room and Kevin happns to have chosen it too.</p>

<p><p class=date>1:31 pm</p>

<p><p>Kevin has been able to answer two questions that the speaker for this
session could not answer.</p>

<p><p>ODS + SAS Graph version 8 can produce cool 3D scrollable graphs and
stuff.</p>

<p><p class=date>2:04 pm</p>

<p><p>Same room; I&rsquo;m in the AppDev Studio section.  This is an application
development thing that I&rsquo;ve tried to install at work.</p>

<p><p>WebAF allows java development</p>

<p><p>webEIS only allows drag and drop and pansy stuff</p>

<p><p class=date>2:48 pm</p>

<p><p>This webAF lecture thing has been pretty flashy..  I wonder how long it
will take to install on my machine and how long to learn it well enough to
actually develop something.</p>

<p><p>Still, I can see Kevin&rsquo;s brain is busy busy watching and thinking how we
can use this.  I greatly look forward to developing cool stuff with it.</p>

<p><p class=date>2:52 pm</p>

<p><p>I just changed the batteries in this thing.</p>

<p><p>Some
<br>French
<br>Women
<br>Grow
<br>Hairy
<br>Oranges</p>

<p><p>Select
<br>From
<br>Where
<br>Group
<br>Having
<br>Order</p>

<p><p class=date>5:21 pm</p>

<p><p>I actually fell asleep for the last bit of the last class thing.  I
wasn&rsquo;t retaining any of the information and then I was just struggling to
stay awake when I realized I didn&rsquo;t have to be awake!  Just leaned back in
my chari against the wall and quite quickly fell asleep.</p>

<p><p>It is so cold in here.</p>

<p><p>Dinner soon.  I&rsquo;ll drink some hot tea.</p>

<p><p class=date>7:24 pm</p>

<p><p>Dinner was yummy finger food type stuff.  Now I&rsquo;m not cold and chilling
in our room.  I spent several phone calls trying to reach people I know in
Austin, but no luck.  I may choose to just be.</p>

<p><p>We just ate breakfast and are waiting for everyone to be ready to go.</p>

<p><p class=date>2:31 pm</p>

<p><p>Brunch was lovely; I was well received by the family, especially by 8
year old Alex who adopted me as his new friend.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re new,&rdquo; he said with
a smile.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes, you have not met me before&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Alex and I played a lot.  He basically climbed all over me.  Fun stuff.
:-)</p>

<p><p>Conversation after brunch focused a lot on politics; Gramma is republican
and Rodd an others are democrat.</p>

<p><p>We got our ceramic plate and bowl back that we painted 2 weeks ago.  They

<p><p>I&rsquo;m at Clay Pit in Austin, have just been dropped off by Wende to meet
Sally here at 7pm.  I haven&rsquo;t been able to reach Sally on her cellphone or
home phone.  I think I&rsquo;ve been stood up.  The hotel I&rsquo;m supposed to be at
tonight for the conference is a couple miles away at the least.  The guy
said to take the highway; he didn&rsquo;t hear me say I dn&rsquo;t have a car.</p>

<p><p>I may call kT who is on campus here at UT (near the restaurant) to see if
I can say HI to her.  That would be a fun surprise if I can find her!   I
have her address but not phone number; I&rsquo;ll let you know how it goes.</p>

<p><p class=date>8:39 pm</p>

<p><p>I walked back and found Sally with Tom - that&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t find her -
she wasn&rsquo;t alone.</p>

<p><p>Here&rsquo;s the funny great icebreaker question of the day! &ldquo;If you could have
anything besides hair grow out of your head, what would it be?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>9:53 pm</p>

<p><p>Bye to Tom.  Sally and I walked to her apartment to listen to a tape of
her band.  I&rsquo;d still like to track down kT.</p>

<p><p>Cool art here, and a cool glass coffee table with a brass-ish horse head
on the top of each leg.</p>

<p><p class=date>11:46 pm</p>

<p><p>Sally and I just played drums on some discarded fault blocks.  At least
she hopes they are discarded.</p>

<p><p>We just found that a particular beat sounds like George Michael&rsquo;s
<em>Faith</em></p>

<p class=date>7:28am CDT Saturday 21 October 2000
<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>At a restaurant and watching a woman lie, saying she
couldn&rsquo;t find her free drink card.  They gave her a free drink anyway,
but another employee was all, &ldquo;oh - her card if filled up for today.&rdquo;
5 free drinks per day and that was it.  they were all &ldquo;why are you
trying to get a free drink - why are you trying to lie to us?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>Once the trouble had passed, I went behind the counter
and was all &ldquo;whats up?&rdquo; to the to the employee that cooks.  He told me
his name after I was all &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know your name&rdquo; and he was
showing me where a roach had been and he a heard a noise in a BIG
electrical box and he asked if he should shut it down to open it and
kill the roach.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was all no way and I moved out of the way because it
looked like he was going to open it anyway and I went upstairs to a
less huge fuse box and he blinked the power off and on on this fuse
box and I lost information that I had loaded - I lost an installation
of some software.  I wondered where I had a backup copy and was
partway installed on it or partway recovered the data and the scene
shifted</p>

<p><p class=dream>some type of experimental roller coaster that Wende
and I were all on.  it was more like a bumpy tube through which we all
were crawling or more like sliding on, or actually not sliding because
it was so bumpy but more like crab walking.  The tube was metal with
waves in the bottom and progressively the tube became more like a tube
made out of wires like a dish washer basket and we were crawling
through on our butts feet first through this thing and we had to
navigate through impossibly small spaces and bend the wires out of the
way in some cases.  The challenge was to get through as quickly as
possible.</p>

<p><p class=dream>then we were in a room where the tube was over but the
coaster was a conveyer belt now and some employess of the belt handed
each person through a device and we had to follow the rules displayed
by the device to move forward.  My little device wasn&rsquo;t working
properly, or I recoginized that I didn&rsquo;t have to use it and could just
walk down the converyor belt, or actually slide forward on my butt.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I came up behind a little kid and his mom whose
question was something about his teeth and she lied to him why she was
looking at his teeth to get him to comply, saying that his dental
insurance had run out.  I was all asking him, &ldquo;do you remember your
insurance number or have a place to write it down?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>She interrupted, &ldquo;oh we don&rsquo;t cheat&rdquo; implying writing
it down would be cheating.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I go &ldquo;it&rsquo;s okay if you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; trying to cover for her
wishes.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re still a good person.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>and wende came in to say bye as she left for work.</p>

<p><p>I just got an email from Fred &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not still
awake are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I emailed him back and when I sent it, I saw an add
for Yahoo Phone.  I signed up for Yahoo Phone and now
you can call 1-800-MY-YAHOO and dial my mailbox number
(it&rsquo;s 10 digits: my area code and home number) and
leave messages for me.  Amazing!  This system notifies
me of phone messages through email.</p>

<p><p>So I was listening to the &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; message for
signing up, and then I got Fred&rsquo;s reply saying he
would call me.  I hung up, checked the message online,
replied, looked down, and the phone was blinking
(ringing with the ringer off).</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; to Fred right now.  He&rsquo;s called me from
his girlfriend&rsquo;s cell phone (1000 minutes per month
$75)</p>

<p><p>I heard Wende thumping around walking in her cute
grumpy way.  &ldquo;Uh oh Fred, we&rsquo;re about to get in
trouble&rdquo;  She had the grumpiest face in the world when
she opened the door to the study.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in trouble for being awake.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I could hardly keep from laughing.  I stifled my
laugh for, &ldquo;Fred says HI!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>She thumped back to the bedroom and picked up the
phone. &ldquo;HI Fred,&rdquo;  and she talked for a bit.  Fred
told us a story about something and then she hung up.</p>

<p><p>Now Fred and I are just talking and it&rsquo;s great to
connect to him!</p>

<p><p class=date>3:26am</p>

<p><p>Fred is ranting about his ex-job, where his boss
was so unhelpful.  &ldquo;I had to talk to every person in
the company; I had to use bits of information from
every person in the company to figure out how to use
the code management system.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>3:33am</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So then I was able to indirectly log into the
system, but what commands to I use???&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>3:36am</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So finally I can check in a program.  This process
has taken <em>days</em>.  It should have taken 5
minutes and then I&rsquo;d be eating a sandwich, but no.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>4:09am</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;re trying to telnet www.robnugen.com 80 and hand
type the GET requests.  Not working; we don&rsquo;t know the
exact syntax.</p>

<p><p>I gotta go to sleep soon.</p>

<p><p class=date>4:26am</p>

<p><p>Good night Fred, great talkin&rsquo; to you.</p>
