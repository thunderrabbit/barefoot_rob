<p>Because it takes 5 hours to import the data in my reliable way, I will
not recreate the machine from scratch in Tokyo region.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll finish it up in California and then move it over to Tokyo.</p>

<p>steps</p>

<ol>
<li><del>add cron jobs</del></li>
<li>Make sure site works</li>
<li>change the domains to correct domains</li>
<li>make an AMI of the box</li>
<li>copy it to Tokyo</li>
<li>spin it up</li>
<li>copy latest data changes over</li>
<li>point DNS to new box</li>
<li>activate SSL</li>
</ol>

<p>Step One requires</p>

<ol>
<li><del>copy cron scripts from live server to local machine</del></li>
<li><del>Create role to deploy them on vagrant box</del></li>
<li><del>create playbook to run role</del></li>
<li><del>copy them into vagrant box (role/templates)</del></li>
<li><del>remove them from local machine</del></li>
<li><del>ansible-vault encrypt them on vagrant box</del></li>
<li><del>Create new mysql backup user</del></li>
<li><del>Create new mysql log_deleter user</del></li>
<li><del>Save changes that created users</del></li>
<li><del>tell role to copy scripts to server</del></li>
<li><del>have the role create the crontab</del></li>
<li><del>run playbook</del></li>
<li><del>test the script</del></li>
<li><del>install s3put command</del></li>
<li><del>create new s3 credentialed user on AWS Console</del></li>
<li><del>Add credentials to new server</del></li>
<li><del>fix GRANTS for mysql user</del></li>
<li><del>test the script</del></li>
<li><del>run the script for real</del></li>
<li><del>see if it runs via cron</del></li>
</ol>

<p>Step Three requires a few steps for me to feel comfortable with it</p>

<ol>
<li>change the domains to different test sub-domains</li>
<li>ensure I can activate SSL on them</li>
<li>run tests on the sites</li>
<li>change the domains to correct domains</li>
</ol>

<p>Step Seven requires telling Ansible to talk to servers in a different
region, which I can probably do in realtime without testing (because
I won&rsquo;t have activated DNS on the box yet).</p>

<p>It looks like I&rsquo;ve nearly got AB&rsquo;s server rebuilt with new Ubuntu OS.
I just need to put the crontab entries on it, and run it through all
the tests.  yay.</p>

<p>CB&rsquo;s two servers are close to being almost updated, but I just have
not taken the time to do them.  Glad they do not have to have mysql
data on them.  Just gotta deal with a big disk.  oof.</p>

<p>sb&rsquo;s server is not really close; I have not gotten Redmine sorted, nor
the actual main site.  boo.</p>

<p>FS&rsquo;s server is kinda simple, so I hope it will go quickly, but I have
not started on it.  bah.</p>

<p>Had lunch with Kai at CPK in Lazona today.  She helped allay my fears
about conducting the orchestra in July.  Not that I have even applied
yet, but I plan to.  After I get these servers updated.</p>

<p>I found
<em><a href="https://tunein.com/radio/Underneath-It-All-A-Nine-Inch-Nails-Podcast-p553944/">Underneath It All</a></em>,
a nine inch nails podcast, and as a result signed up for Google Music
so I can listen to <em>Hesitation Marks</em>&hellip; even though I already bought
the album when it first came out&hellip; because I haven&rsquo;t really listened
to it, because I have not had a CD player for a long time.</p>

<p>This past weekend it rained, so SOGO was cancelled.  I was kinda glad
because I feel behind schedule on getting servers running with
Ansible.  I&rsquo;ve abandoned jumping from Ubuntu 12 to Ubutnu 16 this
time. I&rsquo;m focusing on Ubuntu 14 with the hopes that having this
groundwork laid (on the groundwork laid by Ansible), the next upgrade
will be ready ahead of schedule.</p>

<hr />

<p>An MKP graduate called me while he&rsquo;s in town, but I did not end up
meeting him because of the rain and overworking myself.  moe joe.</p>

<p>work work work tired tired tired but fun talking about science-related
topics.  Before the lessons started at 2pm I was watching videos on
Youtube and like snapped out of a reverie like oh-shit-what-timeisit?
and thank goodness I still had ample time to make it to the lesson but
dannnng that was spooky.  I set an alarm on my phone to alert me 30
minutes beforehand.</p>

<h2 id="20-28-thursday-06-april-2017-jst">20:28 Thursday 06 April 2017 JST</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m on the train now in Shinjuku.  I waited in line 15 minutes before
the train was scheduled to leave and just barely got a seat.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting phenomenon for train queues during rush hour.
If a train is already at the platform, and the second train will
arrive before the first one leaves, passengers line up at each door of
the second train at just about 110% capacity of the seats.  Other
passengers arrive, see there are enough people in line to ensure they
will not get a seat, so go to the first train.  Or queue up for the
<em>third</em> train, on which they will (almost) certainly get a seat.</p>

<hr />

<p>GG lesson was great tonight.  We actually used the book to great
effect.  And Y was inspired to ask a question.  I wonder if the book
helped.</p>

<p>Before Tokyo men&rsquo;s circle tonight, I met Christine to learn a bit more
about the training she has done, and to get a NIN poster from when she
worked on their tour!!</p>

<p>I stopped by The Pink Cow to say HI and get the best burrito in the
world.  Went outside to look for Christine and three (3) police
officers approached me and asked if they could go through all my
stuff.  I&rsquo;m glad I had left my bag inside The Pink Cow!  They were
like &ldquo;yeah you are barefoot so we thought it was strange (and decided
to use that as an excuse to search you)</p>

<li>Lin and I are on our way to meet Tariq who will tell us what
questions to ask of the business owner who offered to sell Lin her
business for １０００万円</li>
<li>I got a surprise phone call the other day: &ldquo;Hey Rob can I talk to
Lin?&rdquo; and offered the idea of selling to Lin.</li>
<li>My first reaction is no way because I have no biz skizzles, no
interest, and am too busy.</li>
<li>Been working on Ansible playbooks to get servers upgraded to Ubuntu
16.04.  Fred helped me with some Bash script to backup historical
monthly database snapshots in year-sized bundles.</li>
<li>I recently e-met Mike in Oregon who is the first person I have
written who had an answer to how to sponsor a community in MKP.</li>
<li>This past Tuesday, I presented Head Heart and Soul for the second
time in Tokyo.  Several of the people I invited canceled at the
last minute, but mostly thanks to Roh, we had 11 participants, 8 of whom
had not seen the event the first time.  One of the men in
attendance has expressed interest in joining Tokyo men&rsquo;s circle.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s cold today, and rainy.  Is it always this cold on April 1st or
is the weather trying to fool us?  No, it&rsquo;s just trying to cool us.</li>
<li>I bought 3 styrofoam blocks which I intend to convert into stairs
for Jennie to climb down from the balcony without cracking the
sunroom roof.  They are currently in my room, waiting to be assembled.</li>
<li>Assembly is probably easy, but affixing them to the roof without
affecting the roof is the trick.
10.I knocked Noisy off my bedside table last night, and its battery
came out.  I guess if I tie a string to it so it won&rsquo;t hit the
floor, I can pull it back up without waking up too much, and
possibly the battery won&rsquo;t bounce out.
11.Lin is super happy with her work; she is freelance-ish with what used to be an annoying full time job.
she was like &ldquo;I quit&rdquo; and they go &ldquo;okay okay okay you can skip the
annoying bits and just do what you like!&rdquo;
12.I have been learning lots with my work while doing a big project
due at the end of April..
13.plus doing my men&rsquo;s group; I am leading Tokyo men&rsquo;s circle, a place to get shit off our proverbial chests
14.And I just went to the dentist today
15.and had a 2 mile flat ground barefoot hike to meet my friend at The Pink Cow!</li>
