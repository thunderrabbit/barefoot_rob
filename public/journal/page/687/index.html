<p class=date>Fucking 2:45AM, Tuesday 15 September 1992</p>

<p>I have to be in class in 7.25 hours.</p>

<p>"Today," Molly, Maggie, Jeanine, and I went to House of Pies and it was totally not busy.  Our waitress, Tina was cool.  She brought me a big glass
of water and learned our names and changed the radio to a cooler station.  We left her a big tip.  Brandon, the RA from second floor Taub, and AJ, and
another dude came in and sat in the adjacent booth.</p>

<p>As we were leaving, we talked for 10 minutes to Angela &amp; Tina, the two waitresses.  Angela is totally pretty.  I love her hair.</p>

<p>Molly said that she did the "Love Scale Test" machine and it said she needed to take a cold shower.  Angela sad, "I never need to take a cold
shower."  And then she said directly to me, "but if I do I'll tell you."  Cool.</p>

<p>I wonder if anything could come of this.</p>

<p>Bobbi update:  She is apparently living with Sarah, a Cougar Place desk attendant.  I looked for Sarah in the phone directory, but didn't find
her.  "Tomorrow" I'll try to locate her the way I saw her on the second day of school.  If that doesn't work, i'll try to wait for her at the UHPD
after or before her Cougar Patrol Shift.  (8PM - 12AM Sat &amp; Sun)</p>

<p class=date>2AM, Saturday 12 September 1992</p>

<p>Today after school, Molly, Laura & I went to Target.  On the way,
we stopped by Cougar Place to pick up Cindy, Marcel's old girlfriend.
While I was helping Cindy put a box in the trunk, Molly shouted, "Rob!
Look ahead!"  It was Bobbi.  It was Bobbi walking up. "Bobbi!" I
called.  She didn't seem to notice me. I couldn't figure out what to
say; I was entranced by her braces.  Suddenly, she was walking away.
What do I do?  Then Molly asked her "Where are you staying?"  "cougar
Place.  Not officially."  Then she was gone.</p>

<p>After Target, I talked to Molly about what I should do the next time I see her.  We decided I should say "HI Bobbi.  How's everything?  You
remember- we met outside of Bates on the second day of school.  Yup Yes Sure Well, I just want to follow you around."</p>

<p>At about 9PM, I was leaving the dorm, and I saw Carrie at the OB desk, so I sat and talked to her until 12AM.  She knows Bobbi well, but said I
should be cautious because she is "unstable."</p>

<p>Carrie use to live in Memorial Chase.  Amazing.  We drew a map and compared stories about old times that we actually never shared.  Carrie totally
likes me, but she smokes.  My policy is that I won't kiss girls who smoke. - - -</p>

<p>At midnight, Judy replaced Carrie at the desk, so Carrie and I went for a walk.  I told Carrie that I didn't have to go out with Bobbi, but that I
just want to kiss her.  I am willing to just be straight forward with Bobbi and say, "I have a braces fetish.  I want to kiss you."  Carrie said Bobbi
would laugh and then say, "OK," and kiss me.  Bobbi would also be flattered, she said...</p>

<p>Carrie and I played and splashed each other in the wading fountain.  Then I lay on top of the big fan thing and dried off somewhat.  Then we played
frisbee a little, and then she gave me a great back massage.  I would have kissed her, but she smokes.  At the end of the night I gave her a good hug, though.</p>

<p class=date>11:50PM, Saturday 12 September 1992</p>

<p>Today I worked with Bruce for 8.5 hours @ $8/hour = $68 dollars off my rent.  Then I went to Heather's and we cruised to BookStop and I bought a
Prob&amp;Stats help book.  Then we got frozen pizza and Ben &amp; Jerry's chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream (RIGHT!!!)</p>

<p><p>I read section 2.1 of Prob &amp; Stats after we ate pizza and before we ate ice cream.  Cool.  Tomorrow is a Homework Blockade when I wake up.  later.</p>

<p>"Today" I found out that Bobbi with Braces is part of the Cougar
Patrol.  I'm going to find her and kiss the shit out of her.  I
totally met Inga, who lives across from Molly & Laura.  We went to
House of Pies and I sat beside Kim, Greg's girlfriend.  Kim said she
hates me, though.  Oh well.  Later.</p>

<p class=date>2:10PM Thursday September 10, 1992</p>

<p>I met Nancy, William, & Trang, in my bowling class.  In our 2
groups (2 groups per sheet of paper & 1 paper per 2 lanes) are Me,
Tim, Scott, Parth, Huy, & Laura in the other lane are Nancy, William,
Jodi, Molly & Trang.  I met Linda & Mike today in FORTRAN.  Linda is
fun.  She slapped my hand when I started picking at the carpet burn on
my foot.  That was funny.  I gave her my internet address, and I got
hers.  If she and I ever remenisce about old times, I'll say she hit
me before I had known her 1 hour.</p>

<p>I got a great mail package from John from Good Morning America.  He
sent an ABC umbrella and a GMA mug and a packet of rattle snake eggs.
Instead of eggs it contains a washer wound up on a rubber band
mechanism and it "buzzes" when the package is opened.  Wonderful.</p>

<p class=date>Midnight Wednesday/Thursday September 9/10 1992</p>

<p>Today after school I came home and goofed around a lot in spite of
the fact I should have been on HOMEWORK BLOCKADE.  So I called Maggie,
and she said I had to do six problems in statistics and turn them in
to her tomorrow.  She said (at my request) she would give me a
"modest" kiss if I did the homework.  That was enough prompting to make
me do it, so I spent abut 5 minutes going through Hard Times, beating
the hell out of my stats book.  Then I spent a solid 3 hours working,
and I did about 10 or 12 problems.  Total cool.</p>

<p>After school today, Maggie and I drove to Radio Shack and got
breadboards for digital logic class.  I met Laura, Parth, Huy, Tim &
Scott today in bowling.</p>

<p>I chatted with Laura in Chicago today in real time over the VAX.
We plan to do it again at 8PM tomorrow.  I flirted with Maggie some
today, and I told her honestly that if I ever settle down, I hope I
can find a girl as perfect as she.</p>

<p>AJ, a freshman in Fred's Baoculus class asked if I ever leave the
dorms.  I told him, "not if I can help it."</p>

<p class=date>11:50PM Monday September 7, 1992, Labor Day.</p>

<p>Last night I drove out to Tomball to say HI to dad and check out
his new 486DX 33MHz SVGA computer.  Very cool.  We hooked up my tape
backup and gave him a bunch of stuff including my Xrated gifs and
such.  We looked at those briefly, claiming non-interest.</p>

<p>We also played frisbee in the rain.  Very fun.  The rain was
pleasant and the air was warm.  Fred and I tossed the ol' friz around
for about half an hour.  Now I'm home and I just did a down/upload
session on the Castle of Dreams and I played Blockout and practiced on
a typing tutor that dad gave me.  Dad's going to try to get my 140 meg
hard drive fixed.  I would totally love that.  Later</p>

<p class=date>2AM Sunday Sept 6.</p>

<p>2 days ago, Friday night while we were in the checkout line at
Randall's, I did the most incredible thing.  Marcel had 3 bananas and
was trying to guesstimate their weight.  He said, "these are about a
pound."  I picked them up, "no. they are a full one and one half
pounds.  In fact, they are one point six two pounds."  Then the dude
put them on the scale.  1.62 pounds.  "Oh my God!" We gave each other
five really hard.  It was totally incredible.  I kept the receipt.
It's in my scrapbook.</p>

<p>"Today" I slept fully until noon.  I listened to the radio about
Lalapaloza 92, a mini woodstock out 59 south.  I tried in vain to do
some prob & stats, but it sucks like crazy, so I went to the dorms and
Molly helped me.</p>

<p>I played hard at disk gun warrior with AJ, Steven, Brian and some
other dude on second floor.  We each have disk guns and we run
everywhere in the dorms shooting each other.  At one point, I tackled
Steve at full top speed and we both almost died smashing against the
wall.  His semiautomatic dart gun got fucked up, and we spent several
hours trying to fix it.  We just about got it fixed but not perfect.
Later</p>
