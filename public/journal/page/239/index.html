<p>The sky is beautiful blue today.</p>

<p>While in Kawasaki station, I took a picture of orange links of a crane
with blue sky background.  I may remember to upload the picture before
I upload this entry.</p>

"ohhhh, those are *our* boxes!" we kept repeating it because the reality was setting in  We had decided to start a restaurant.  "Oh, those are *our* boxes"
Oh my goodness, we started a restaurant,  that's *rtight*!
I wondered how we were even going to get the boxes upstairs where we had space to put tables for people to eat.  I tried to wonder what it would be like with people inn our home, eating; who was going to cook? I guess I would have to do lots of dishes from here on out.  I realized that it wouldn't be that I had to wash every dish every niht, at least at first because they wouldn't have found out about our restaurant at first.  I consoled myelf that we'd have maybe a single couple as guests on the first night.

Loking at the refridgerator I knew it was full of food but we'd have to buy a lot more, and then carry it upstairs to be cooked or maybe serverd if we cooked down there.One guy was leaving just as the boxes came in.  he had been talking about something but we didn't need any, so we were liek "okay thanks an let him go


Lin got a phone call from Meg, who was related to the first person like her mom or daughter and I thought, oh it's related to the other news; someone had gotten hurt and then it turns out she was dying from yeras of smoking, and I was like, "well..." (ya should ahve thought of that before you started smoking) and Rita came over talking about a non-smoking campaign and I said yeah they have some resources in Shibuya to give peoplefor free and I'd take hero over there if she wanted.  She aaid no, politely, but I understood she was still in grief over the death to want to deal with something new. she needed to go or I jusat wanted her to go so I was like, "okay, so we'll see you later!" and got up so she left and as she was leaving a guy was brining in a bunch of boxes.  Who the hell are those for? We wondered...

<p>Going to lunch with M, with whom I zip lined on Sunday.</p>

<p>##15:00:11</p>

<p>We ate at Wired Cafe on the east side of Shinagawa station, then
walked two blocks east, then south along the river, then across the
river on a blue bridge, and saw some bicycle rental place called &ldquo;bike
sharing&rdquo; though we&rsquo;d have to pay.</p>

<p>Continued south on the east side of the river to a large black
metallic structure shaped like an O when viewed from the river, but
like an n when looking parallel to the river.</p>

<p>We talked about travel and what we&rsquo;d do if we had mo money.  (Buy a
house and not live in Japan.)</p>

<p>Was planning to meet T and M at 3:30 but M&rsquo;s grandfather died and T
forgot to tell me the meeting was therefore canceled.  So we&rsquo;re going
to meet in about an hour from now.  While waiting, I&rsquo;m seated on
Yamanote Line, traveling from Tokyo to Shinagawa, the long way around.</p>

<p>Talking to Aaron, that the pinnacle that sums up our bitcoin meetup.</p>

<p>Talking about what products we can grow in the city that will return
the highest value per volume.  Apparently not raspberries.</p>

                        <p>##00:54 Friday 28 November 2014 JST##</p>

<p>On my way out of Roppongi, I shook the hands of the various bar
managers/owners who said hello, and I took a liking to Ken, who had
white hairs in his beard.</p>

<p>He invited me to come up just to see the place so I could come back
next time.  Okay; that can&rsquo;t hurt, I figured, and followed him up to
6th floor of some building.</p>

<p>We walked past the doorman and he opened the doors to reveal&hellip; six or
seven beautiful, tall, beautifully dressed women.</p>

<p>Ooops.  I can refuse any amount of drugs or alcohol, but I know my
limit when it comes to women: the sky.  So, I gratefully said &ldquo;thank
you and good night&rdquo; and did a quick 180, hoping the elevator door would
still be open.  It wasn&rsquo;t, so I looked for a staircase, saw none, so
looked for elevator button, saw none, and just about felt panic as Ken
pushed the elevator button for me.  (It was right next to the elevator
where it should be; it just wasn&rsquo;t lit.)</p>

<p>The doors opened immediately (thank goodness), but not before three
girls came asking why I was leaving so soon.  &ldquo;Oh your bag looks
heavy,&rdquo; one said in Japanese; &ldquo;what&rsquo;s in it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I answered, &ldquo;ummm&hellip;&rdquo; (don&rsquo;t say computer; don&rsquo;t say computer) &ldquo;my
coat&rdquo; as Ken answered for me: &ldquo;stuff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They asked a few questions about where I live and why I needed to go
home.  I showed my wedding ring and said &ldquo;I&rsquo;m married&rdquo; and one was
like, &ldquo;oh, but if you don&rsquo;t eat; it&rsquo;s okay&hellip;&rdquo; and I was like, &ldquo;Ooohhh
I see!&rdquo; as the most attractive(*) girl smiled her way into my personal space,
hugging me gently, looking directly into my eyes. Oh goodness that
moment was captivating.  I put my arms around her as well, and put my
chin over her shoulder for a bit more platonic hug.</p>

<p>Okay, this has(n&rsquo;t) gone too far (enough), so I apologized again, and
wanted to say &ldquo;今度&rdquo; (next time) which is basically a polite way of
saying &ldquo;never&rdquo;, but I didn&rsquo;t want to give anyone any hope and gently
extricated myself into the elevator.</p>

<p>Ken joined me as the doors closed.  On our way down, I was like, &ldquo;man,
those girls are hard for me to leave!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>(*) The most attractive was the one with a retainer wire accenting her
lovely smile.</p>
