<p>Great fun at SOGO today and not too hot, but a bit tiring.  It&rsquo;s
apparently Alisha&rsquo;s last day.  Chatted with Thanuja at the Mexican
restaurant for lunch; 12 SOGO peeps at our table.  Leo and Lydia
reminded me about geocaching.</p>

<p>Not as late as last night, but may not get to bed by my target of
midnight.</p>

<p>Watched too much damn ER with Lin, but I gotta admit it&rsquo;s a good
show.  We are at Season 5 Episode 3 or so.</p>

<p>Had three meetings this morning, getting off to a great start, but did
<em>not</em> do any paid work.  Did do 1.3 hours of MT3, but have not
uploaded the results yet.  Might as well do that tonight.</p>

<p>Okay Dragonframe is exporting the clip now.</p>

<p>Did some good work on ConSwi as well.</p>

<p>One of the fans on my computer is making noise.  I need to reboot the
machine anyway, so I guess I will do that and take it apart tonight.</p>

<h2 id="23-51">23:51</h2>

<p>Okay Dragonframe finished exporting the snippet.</p>

<p>Okay, here is the NEW snippet <a href="https://youtu.be/3QNEW8hqHyU">https://youtu.be/3QNEW8hqHyU</a></p>

<p>Just watched a couple episodes of Rick and Morty on Netflix.  From
season 1, the Zigerian scammers, and then the Mr Needful half of the
Pluto episode (, fast forwarding through the Pluto parts).</p>

<p>This was after Japanese lesson with Mel, who often gives me bonus time
yay!  We read a few pages of a Doraemon book with 100 four-kanji words.</p>

<p>All that was after eating chocolate on the way home from the station
after reading <em>Planet on Purpose</em> after talking to Yoko after the
lesson after receiving the remainder of the chocolate rabbit she
brought to class after she arrived late after we had been talking
about <em>Planet on Purpose</em> after talking about Skype after having
talked about the lesson from last week after Mayumi asked me about it
after not having been there then.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s lesson started after I helped some people from Atlanta Georgia
charge their Suica after I charged my own card after arriving in
Akihabara after taking the train from Kawasaki after buying a bottle
of milk tea after noting it came with a chipmunk character (from Chip
and Dale) <em>inside</em> an adjacent bottle after going into the shop after
having finished four lessons at the SCC, including tweaking some
translation about a new exhibit, after learning that &ldquo;exhibit&rdquo; in
Japanese is てんじ, though I am not sure of its spelling.</p>

<p>I had gone to SCC after reading <em>Planet on Purpose</em> on the train after
leaving home after working on ConSwi after attending the Court of
Support meeting after checking in and out of my Integration Group,
&ldquo;Cyber Knights&rdquo; after having breakfast after Lin made it after we woke
up.</p>

<p>Today while I was in the cafe below Muza, a woman came up and asked if
I could speak English.  I drew her a map to a bank on the other side
of the station, but had a slightly bad feeling about sending her on a
possible wild goose chase.  Her name is Dipika, and she&rsquo;s been in
Japan just a little bit and will be here for 2 more weeks.  She didn&rsquo;t
exchange currency at the airport so she had no yen to buy a ticket,
and they don&rsquo;t take credit cards.  She&rsquo;s interested in finance, and
asked me my thoughts on Bitcoin once I told her I did computer stuff.</p>

<p>She said she&rsquo;s interested in China for the financial possibilities,
and I definitely agree; it seems Chinese economy is on the rise.</p>

<p>Anyway, I walked with her to the bank &hellip;. and discovered only ATM
machines were there.  She needed to talk to a person.  I misremembered
what street had her bank so we walked to the wrong street for a
different bank and then we were like bah and just went to Shinagawa
station where she could exchange her voucher to get her JR Rail pass.</p>

<p>The staff there spoke English enough to help her find a mobile wifi
provider, so we went there and got her hooked up with wifi for two
weeks.  Once she got some cash exchanged in Shinagawa, she paid me
back for the train ticket to Shinagawa from Kawasaki.  I gave her the
money back in exchange for updates during her adventures.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s hoping Dipika has a great trip!</p>

<p>I added lots of frames yesterday to Marble Track 3 video.  There was a
long section with just 2 or 3, or even just 1 character moving at a
time. I added 20 seconds to the video, which destroys any previous day
expect maybe the first couple days when I just had the manager walking
around.</p>

<p>I did not exactly predict the current situation; I just knew the
chopstick poking off the edge of the track should do something.  It
ended up knocking over a bridge, which knocked the switch into fast
mode which caused some havoc including Candy Cane Mom and Green Cutter
to lean toward the center of the stage to offset centrifugal force
due to the rotational velocity.  (I think my terms are correct here).</p>

<p>Once the stage was stopped, they fell on their faces, and the large
marble rolled off the stage from where it had been held by the
relatively newly placed ribs, which hopefully indicates (1) the ribs
work, (2) there is at least some sense of internal logic to the movie.</p>

<p>This morning I woke up with a start in Noborito, where I transfer
between lines from Odakyu main line to JR Nambu line.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh snap my stop!&rdquo; and bounced out of my seat, got off the train and
was confused about how far down the platform I was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where am I?  This is&hellip; ohhhh&hellip;&rdquo; and went back in the train and sat
back down in my seat.  (thankfully no one else took it!)</p>

<p>I had already transferred in Noborito, and had fallen asleep on the
Nambu line train which <em>starts</em> in Noborito.</p>

<p>Nice synchronicity brought two old friends together on the train just
in time for one to invite the other two men&rsquo;s group last night, the
first Tuesday of the month, when new men are welcome to join.</p>

<p>Six men in the circle last night.  Good strong container in which we
did a lot of good work.</p>

<p>While walking from Roppongi down to my lunchtime lesson, I walked past
a woman (after admiring her tattoo), and then she walked past me and
said, &ldquo;hey I like your style,&rdquo; referring to my bare feet.  Turns out
she works at <a href="https://gonpachi.jp/?page_id=22">Gonpachi</a>,
<a href="https://thecitylane.com/tokyo-gonpachi-aka-kill-bill-restaurant/">aka the Kill Bill restaurant</a>.
She invited me to come by, so I did around 1:45pm.</p>

<p>She must have been busy or the message did not get to her, but no
Nono.  I left her a note; I hope that gets to her.  I forgot to draw a
bare foot on it.</p>

<p>Okay, Nono, your turn!  Check out the co-gender group which meets on
Monday nights 7pm - 9pm very close to the restaurant!</p>

<p><a href="https://tokyo.mypowercircle.org/">https://tokyo.mypowercircle.org/</a>   This is written for the <em>men&rsquo;s</em>
circle, but the
<a href="https://tokyo.mypowercircle.org/agreements/">agreements</a> are the same.</p>

<p>No one attended co-gender group (besides me) today.  I read several
pages of <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Planet-Purpose-Prosperity-Authentic-Leadership-ebook/dp/B07BNRS5LC/ref=smi_www_rco2_go_smi_g2609328962?_encoding=UTF8&amp;%2AVersion%2A=1&amp;%2Aentries%2A=0&amp;ie=UTF8"><em>Planet on Purpose</em></a> by Brandon Peele.  Quite a good book for me.</p>
