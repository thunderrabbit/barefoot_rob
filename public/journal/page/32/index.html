<p>Today I won best Table Topics speech for making backronyms for JEBI,
the name of the typhoon that just blew through.</p>

<p>I am super bummed that I missed the obvious link to the word of the day, which was improvised
to be &ldquo;improvise&rdquo;</p>

<p>I started my speech &ldquo;Given that I have just started a business that
has this acronym, I will be happy to tell you about Jumping
Entertainment Business Incorporated.&rdquo; and rambled on from there,
squeezing in another backronym for JEBI like Jelly Evaluation Bureau
of Investigations that can tell how high people jumped by how far they
sink into jelly.</p>

<p>My second draft would start the same, but &ldquo; .. tell you about Jumping
Entertaining Business Improvisation, which allows us to improvise
business models based on entertaining jumpers.  Take the kangaroo, for
example. ..&rdquo;</p>

<p>Had a quick livestream today during which Reversible Guy (apparently)
glued a single toothpick and G Choppy cut two others which I had hoped
to glue but could not quite before I had to head out to Roppongi where
I am currently on Zoom with MKP men&rsquo;s circle before the Cisco
Toastmasters meeting from noon to 1pm.</p>

<p>A man has two lives.  The second one begins when he realized he only
has one life.</p>

<p>My second life has begun.  I am feeling the fire in my gut, mixed with
the fear of rejection and failure.  But as I have learned through
experience, if I follow my fear I will be headed in the right
direction in life.</p>

<p>For me these fears result in me dying alone.  There is a process
called What&rsquo;s at Risk which I learned from Mankind Project.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at risk if I do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;People might not like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at Risk if they do not like it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will not like me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at Risk if they do not like you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will leave me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at Risk if they leave you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will eventually die alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once we get to the bottom, we start over with the other option as a
starting point.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at risk if I don&rsquo;t do it?&rdquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will lead a pointless life&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at Risk if you lead a pointless life?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will have no enthusiasm&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at Risk if you have no enthusiasm?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will have no connection to friends&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at Risk if you have no connection to friends?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will die alone&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have been through this chain of broken logic countless times.  In my
case, when I follow the what&rsquo;s at risk line of questions, I always end up dying alone.</p>

<p>I believe the point of the exercise is to point out the logical
fallacy.  Somewehre there is a mis-step in logic.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s try it again:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at Risk if you do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;People might not like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at Risk if people might not like it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will adjust it and try again&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aha!  That was quick.  Because my excitement is merged in with the
fear, coming from a core <em>knowing</em> that this is the right way to go.
Or at least the right ballpark or sport.</p>

<p>That knowing is there that I will not just give up.  I will keep
coming back at it from different angles until I get it right.  I just
have to hope I won&rsquo;t be like a mosquito trying to go through a screen
window.</p>

<hr />

<p>So what is the vision?  The vision is to make Emotional Intelligence
as important as that other kind of Intelligence, just plain old
intellect.  The vision is that I can stand listening to someone yell
at me when I fuck up my visa.  &ldquo;You have to leave Japan today!&rdquo; big
man was yelling at me, and I was aware of the fear inside my body, but
did not get pushed around by it.  I could feel it swirling.  &ldquo;I had
fucked up.  My life was ruined.&rdquo;  But I also know fear is an emotion.
It is energy in motion.  Fear is that feeling that comes up when I do
not have enough information to make a decision about the future.  I
want to stay in the country; I am listening to a man yell at me,
saying that I cannot.  I stood there calmly listening.</p>

<p>He paused for second.  &ldquo;Do you understand what I am saying?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I assured him I did and reiterated the sailent points.  He agreed that
I got it, but the points pointed to one main point.  I had to leave.</p>

<p>So I punted.  &ldquo;I am planning to get married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had popped the question to Lin a month or so prior to this event.
During that month she kept asking if I had gotten my visa sorted.  &ldquo;I
still have time; the postcard says to do it by July 18th&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turns out, that date didn&rsquo;t matter.  It was the date actually <em>in my
passport</em> that mattered.</p>

<p>To be Continued &hellip;.</p>

<p>Yesterday a typhoon grazed Tokyo.  We got some wind, but hardly any
rain.  I left early for men&rsquo;s group to make sure I would be there even
if the trains stopped for the typhoon.</p>

<p>I had loads of time, so I walked from Yoyogi Uehara to Nishi Azabu, by
way of the Snoopy Museum!  The museum costs 2000 yen to enter, so I
skipped it until I have more time and can go with Lin.</p>

<li><p>I have just removed the ## 06:12 Monday 03 September 2018 JST date
from the top of this journal.  Marking them in h2 tags makes them a
bit too big for this theme.  I hate to modify my source code to fit
a theme, but that happened.</p></li>

<li><p>I recently got the <a href="https://marbletrack3.com">website for Mable Track
3</a> (nearly) up to date.  It now has all
the entries that had been in my journal at
<a href="https://new.robnugen.com/tags/mt3/">https://new.robnugen.com/tags/mt3/</a> and all the entries have an
<code>episode_image</code> in the frontmatter.  Not all the entries have a
<em>unique</em> episode image, but that is another matter.</p></li>

<li><p>The <a href="https://b.robnugen.com/art/marble_track_3/website/2018_sep_02_mt3_placeholder.png">episode image placeholder for Marble Track 3</a> includes the
text &ldquo;All Episodes (8.97 days)&rdquo; which is a new thing I just added
to the site with the help of <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>, Youtube&rsquo;s v3 API (both
of which are Google assets.. hmmm), and
<a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo static website generator</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Just this morning I split the source into two files, one that
actually does the API calls, and one that does all the
logic to create a list of all my Youtube videos in a TOML file.</p></li>

<li><p>Until this very moment, I had decided to <em>not</em> keep a copy of the
TOML file in any of my repos, but now I think I will, for a couple
of reasons.</p>

<ul>
<li>One, so I can show you my
<a href="https://github.com/marbletracks/marbletrack3.com/blob/master/data/playlists/knownvideos.toml">TOML file of all Marble Track 3 videos</a></li>
<li>Two, so the website for Marble Track 3 is easier to recreate
(without installing <del>Go</del> <ins>extra libraries</ins>)</li>
<li>Three, so I can have a <a href="https://github.com/marbletracks/marbletrack3.com/commit/16c9e0acfbebcccf8de83e94ae738e61efdc1f47">history of the file</a>, which currently is <em>not</em> sorted by Publish Date, though I would like it to be
because that would make it easier to figure out what to name the
livestreams that did not get unique names.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>I have just linked git commits both directions from Marble Track 3
source to my journal entries, and from my journal entries to Marble
Track 3 source.  Which ones will break first?</p></li>

<li><p>I am halfway through Anikiko&rsquo;s Shift Your Shit program, subtitled
Own and Sell Your Gifts, or something.  It has been great, giving
me several good ideas, which I am beginning to implement.  Oh, that
reminds me, I need to write to John Gaughan, re: volunteer burnout</p></li>

<li><p>I am using a water Android phone from a couple years ago, an Aquos
something something.  I am using my Macbook from more than a couple
years ago, perhaps 5 years (therefore 50 laptop-years).  I got a
new backpack with wheels and a hard plastic cover for my computer.</p></li>

<li><p>I have not been wearing shoes in Tokyo for 8 years now.  That is 1
year more than I was barefoot in Houston.  That&rsquo;s a strange thought
for me.</p></li>

<li><p>Lin and I still do not have kids, but we have our cat Jennie, who
is maybe 5 years old.  6?  Lin still likes to keep Jennie inside
at night, even though Jennie climbs around on Lin&rsquo;s head at night,
meowing (to be let outside, I think).</p></li>

<li><p>I have started taking walks in the morning, though I did not walk
the past couple of days.  Tomorrow I will walk for sure!  I walk
for about an hour, trying to find a new street or new area I have
not previously seen.  This search has turned up a pizza place, a
hidden grave yard, a brick fish tank, and a nice path along the
nearby recycling center.</p></li>

<li><p>I have started eating less, and for shorter durations during the
day.  Lin is interested in doing similarly as a <em>concept</em>, but not
always interested in doing it in <em>practice</em>.  I have been hearing
more and more about intermittant fasting and its benefits.  Most
recently, I heard that it&rsquo;s good to eat only during a 10 hour
window each day.  I am not quite there yet, but close.</p></li>

<li><p>I am headed to Akabanebashi now for IL lesson.  Then walk to Nishi
Azabu for UG lesson featuring Akari, Emi, Kazu, Kenji, Masa,
Ryuya, Shinji, and Taka (in ABC order).</p></li>

<li><p>It looks like co-gender group will not happen tonight.</p></li>

<li><p>Just arrived in Shinjuku.  Changing trains now.</p></li>

<li><p>Oh, that reminds me, I have been keeping track of my finances,

<p>毎週末、母とスカイプで喋る。　　I talk to my mom each weekend via Skype.</p>

<p>今朝、スカイプを始める予定の時間に「日本語も勉強しないと」と思ったから、母に英語で
「今日、日本語の宿題しないと」と書いた。  When it came time to Skype, I
remembered I also need to study Japanese. I wrote as much to my mom in English.</p>

<p>母のため日本語の<ruby><rb>文字</rb><rt>もじ</rt></ruby>が面白そう思っ
たから日本語で「今、日本語の宿題をしないと<ruby><rb>多分</rb><rt>たぶん</rt></ruby>やらないかも」と書いた。
I thought she might enjoy seeing some Japanese characters, so I wrote
in Japanese, &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t do Japanese homework now, I probably won&rsquo;t do
it.&rdquo;</p>

<pre><code>文字　もじ
文章　ぶんしょう
</code></pre>

<p>母から返事は英語で「じゃ、私映画を見るかも。」   She replied in
English like,
&ldquo;well, okay, I&rsquo;ll probably watch a movie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>あっ。まだ喋りたいと思ったんだけど。  Oh, but I still wanted to talk.</p>

<p>Wow <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> is great.  The compiler doesn&rsquo;t let you
fuck around too much.  &ldquo;Hey you&rsquo;re wasting variables!&rdquo;  &ldquo;Hey those are
different!&rdquo; &ldquo;Hey you already did that!&rdquo;  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t include it if you
don&rsquo;t need it!&rdquo;  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t use it if you didn&rsquo;t include it&rdquo;</p>

<p>I can imagine what Travis meant when he said if a <del>Hakyll</del> <ins>Haskell</ins> program
compiles, it probably works correctly.  Even with all the side effects
available in Go, I am <em>much</em> more confident that my code works than
with any PHP code.</p>

<p>Now I wanna rewrite my legacy PHP sites in Go.  Not gonna do it, but
the thought crossed my mind.</p>

<p>Anyway, in less than a day, I was able to create this TOML output file
that represents the data in Marble Track 3&rsquo;s YouTube account.</p>

<pre><code>[Videos]
  [Videos.-ZEerNH_ldU]
    VideoId = &quot;-ZEerNH_ldU&quot;
    Title = &quot;Marble Track 3 construction Live Stream&quot;
    Published = 2018-08-30T10:54:30Z
    Duration = 0
  [Videos.M2Mbu-6B_mY]
    VideoId = &quot;M2Mbu-6B_mY&quot;
    Title = &quot;Marble Track 3 construction Live Stream: fifteen segments in outer spiral&quot;
    Published = 2018-08-30T11:36:47Z
    Duration = 0
  [Videos.W6IQYjU-BLc]
    VideoId = &quot;W6IQYjU-BLc&quot;
    Title = &quot;Marble Track 3: snake looking for a spot&quot;
    Published = 2018-08-28T03:07:33Z
    Duration = 0
</code></pre>

<p>The duration is 0 on all of them because
<a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/35170788">v3 of YouTube&rsquo;s API does not return durations</a>
when getting all videos in a list.  I will add code to get the
durations sooner than later, because the whole reason to do this is to
automatically have the total Livestream duration be updated on
<a href="https://www.marbletrack3.com/">Marble Track 3 website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="00-00-saturday-01-september-2018-jst">00:00 Saturday 01 September 2018 JST</h2>

<p>Just two hours later (including dinner with Lin) and bingo I got the Durations as well.</p>

<p>Not bad for my first day messing around with Go.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/marbletracks/go-get-video-durations/blob/36426e31be42c7c16f7a6f1e705c1106a111a789/my_uploads.go">https://github.com/marbletracks/go-get-video-durations/blob/36426e31be42c7c16f7a6f1e705c1106a111a789/my_uploads.go</a></p>

<h2 id="08-56-sunday-02-september-2018-jst">08:56 Sunday 02 September 2018 JST</h2>

<p>A day later, I spruced it up some, including adding video types and
limiting superfluous calls to Youtube API.</p>
