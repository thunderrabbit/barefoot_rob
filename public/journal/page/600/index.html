                        <p><p class=date>10:10 am</p>

<p><p>awake.  AJ&rsquo;s voice in the hall woke me up.  He tried to lie and say it
wasn&rsquo;t him.  He wasn&rsquo;t really trying to lie so much as he was just not
willing to admit that he was in error for hollering near the advisor
sleeping area.</p>

<p><p class=date>10:57 am</p>

<p><p>Sat in on Adam&rsquo;s touchgroup, got some information on upcoming workshops
and carnival festivities.  Then we all told something that people couldn&rsquo;t
tell by looking at us.  I told peeps that I had a masectomy of my left
breast.</p>

<p><p>So Ryan said, &ldquo;So, for a while, you didn&rsquo;t have a boob.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Um, no.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just kiddin&rsquo; I just wanted to say &lsquo;boob&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>me imitating Beavis or Butt-Head &ldquo;huh huh you said &lsquo;boob&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Ran around randomly and hugged Oliver who is leaving for Maine.  See ya,
Oliver.</p>

<p><p class=date>11:01am</p>

<p><p>Now I&rsquo;m in balloon workshop.</p>

<p><p>This guy is sibling of Stevie.  He has dry humor, and pretty funny.</p>

<p><p>First balloon animal:  Worm.  2nd snake.  3rd a lizard with all its legs
cut off.</p>

<p><p>His name is Dustin.  He can tie a balloon with one hand.</p>

<p><p class=date>11:08 am</p>

<p><p>We all made dogs.  I made a 6 legged dog.</p>

<p><p class=date>11:13 am</p>

<p><p>We all made hats</p>

<p><p class=date>11:25 am</p>

<p><p>We all made different shape dogs</p>

<p><p class=date>11:28 am</p>

<p><p>I made a dog with wheels.</p>

<p><p class=date>11:35 am</p>

<p><p>I made a somewhat bent baloon in attempt to make a piral.  Special thanks
to Sean for helping me pump it up.</p>

<p><p>Yes, while Dustin The Balloon guy can blow one up with one breath, Sean
and I have to use one of Dustin&rsquo;s balloon pumps.</p>

<p><p class=date>11:38 am</p>

<p><p>Phat Pat just made the large intestine.</p>

<p><p class=date>11:45 am</p>

<p><p>He&rsquo;s showing people how to make a flower.  I just made a something with
no end.</p>

<p><p class=date>11:55 am</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;re not worthy!!  Dustin just inflated a ballon, kept it straight, shot
it up at the ceiling and it stuck there.  As if it were just lying on the
floor but it&rsquo;s on the ceiling.</p>

<p><p class=date>12:02 pm</p>

<p><p>Phat Pat just made a fishing pole with string and hook and caught a fish,
all in balloon.</p>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s so cool to see all the wonderful creativity in the room.</p>

<p><p class=date>12:05 pm</p>

<p><p>Sean and I made a figure 8, or infinity symbol, all freestyle.</p>

<p><p>[smak!!]</p>

<p><p class=date>12:19 pm</p>

<p><p>Dustin made us a rubber bullet and showed us how to launch it out of a
balloon. Sean just shot a rubber bullet.</p>

<p><p class=date>1:37 pm</p>

<p><p>We quit making stuff and pretty much just shot a lot of rubber bullets
around the room.</p>

<p><p>Phat Pat made a drink holder that attaches to his arm and is supported
with a sling thing around his neck.  It held a full coke, but he seemed
never to find a straw so he never could drink it.</p>

<p><p>Lunch was breads and soup; I mixed all three soup varieties - vegetable,
tomato, and chicken tortilla.  plus a cookie and lemon bread.  very nice.</p>

<p><p>YAC meeting now or soon actually as people are gathering, they were
sleepin.</p>

<p><p>- - - - -</p>

<p><p>After the YAC meeting, most of the rally youth joined forces to create
some childrens&rsquo; books that will be used in a local shelter or something.</p>

<p><p class=date>6:16 pm</p>

<p><p>I noticed a youth not with the rest of the group.  I sat next to her to
see if I could help.  I talked for quite a while with Angela, whose first
rally this is.  I&rsquo;m pleased that she seems much happier and hanging out with
people more than when I saw her sitting alone.</p>

<p><p>We had touchgroup meeting and played a get-the-group-across-the-lava
game.  They did quite well, but were not impressed enough to play again.</p>

<p><p>Now we are playing Mental Clue, and have been for over an hour.  Me, Amy,
Adam, Hillary, Sean, Elizabeth.
The game is based on the board game Clue:  Each person in the circle think
of a person, place, and weapon.  Then people try to guess what they are
thinking.  The thinker tells the guesser how many answers they got correct.</p>

<p><p>Now we&rsquo;re about to play frisbee.</p>

<p><p class=date>8:11 pm</p>

<p><p>disc was great fun.  We played through sunset in the parking lot.
Angela&rsquo;s throwing got progressively better through the evening.   Then I
grabbed Travis&rsquo; unicycle and rode around the parking lot a lot.  I even rode
up and down the parking lot with about a 5% grade (I&rsquo;m guessing about the
grade).</p>

<p><p>I even helped Whitney ride the uni about 2 revolutions worth.</p>

<p><p>Now I&rsquo;m &lsquo;bout to drop off all my gear (camera, visor, wallet) at my bed
and go visit the Conival  &ldquo;con&rdquo; (conference) plus carnival)</p>

<p><p class=date>12:03am  Sunday 3 September 2000</p>

<p><p>Conival was great; I was recruited to get pie in the face (pie tins with
whipped cream) and then I had a fun stint in the dunk tank.  I counted 37
balls thrown and not one hit the thing to dunk me.  #38 did it.</p>

<p><p>Sean got to be the dunkee and taunted me to throw balls to knock him in.
I threw one with my eyes closed and missed.  The second one I threw I
knocked him in.  I didn&rsquo;t use my third shot.  Amy said, &ldquo;stopping while
you&rsquo;re ahead, eh?&rdquo;   &ldquo;Yep!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>But now I&rsquo;m wondering if I could have gotten two in a row..   Hmmm</p>

<p><p>There was a band and some concern about their &ldquo;groupies&rdquo;.. friends that
they apparently invited to watch them perform.  Pretty much nothing happened
that I saw, but some youth felt uncomfortable.</p>

<p><p>Cleanup was pretty long after the conival, &hellip;  Matt and I yelled/recited
DMX &ldquo;y&rsquo;all gon make me lose my cool, up in heah, up in heah&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Made different lyrics and fun.</p>

<p><p>Psycho and I <em>ran</em> with a big cart of chairs, nearly crashing
through doors, but we made such a ruckus that people moved shit out of the
way, opened doors, moved chairs&hellip;  we just blasted through.</p>

<p><p>Talked to Susie about possibly being local advisor type person for youth
at Northwoods church..  basically my original YRUU stomping grounds.
Northwoods was where I attended my first rally and all that.</p>

<p><p>My understanding is that they need an advisor and I am certainly free on
Sundays and interested in reconnecting with the church and the youth, many
of whom I knew as 4 and 5 year olds way back when.</p>

<p><p class=date>12:11 am</p>

<p><p>Many peoples are sleeping, but many more are loudly congregating in the
dining hall.  I think for worship and or talent show.</p>

                        <p><p class=date>8:52am Friday 1 September 2000</p>

<p><p>Today is Tulsa rally!  Wende and I are en route to get my car from the
shop.  It apparently wasn&rsquo;t done yesterday; the guy never called me.</p>

<p><p class=date>10:52am</p>

<p><p>Scott was <em>almost</em> finished when we arrived.  They finished up the job
(had to paint the pin stripe) and we paid and left.  New windshield and new
front for $475, which is less than what we got from insurance.  Yay!
Insurance said it would be like $997 and paid me $497 since I&rsquo;ve got a $500
deductable.  Anyway, it&rsquo;s all good now.</p>

<p><p>Rally tonight!</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m hoping to leave work at 2pm.</p>

                        <p><p class=date>4:41 pm Friday 1 September 2000</p>

<p><p>We haven&rsquo;t left yet.  We&rsquo;re still at First Church waiting for more youth
to arrive.  We were supposed to meet at 3pm and I was hoping we would
therefore leave by 4pm.</p>

<p><p>Ryan just flipped seeing my keyboard thingie here.</p>

<p><p>Big news: 14 year old Lacy&rsquo;s boyfriend is out of jail.  &ldquo;Why was he in
jail?&rdquo;  &ldquo;He&rsquo;s bad.&rdquo;   Nicole says, &ldquo;I disussed it with her; she&rsquo;s not
talking.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Other big news - Colleen almost get kidnapped today.  Scary shirtless guy
grabbed her arm and she screamed like a stuck pig and slapped him and he let
her go.</p>

<p><p class=date>6:05 pm</p>

<p><p>So now we are at Northwoods church and nearly all collected into both
vans.  It is raining pretty heavily and was raining even harder on the way
up here on the Tollway.</p>

<p><p>Lots of people high energy and some arguments about who sits next to who:
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to sit next to a wet person!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Ryan and Nikki just ran through the rain to the van.  Ryan faked like the
door was locked just to freak Nikki.  hahahaha!!</p>

<p><p class=date>6:09pm</p>

<p><p>We leave soon I think.  Ah nice - Evelyn has walkie talkies so we can
talk to the other van.</p>

<p><p class=date>6:53pm</p>

<p><p>We didn&rsquo;t leave soon, but I drove 1.6 miles in the parking lot in a
circle.  One lap around the parking lot is about .06 miles.  When asked why
I was doing this, I simply told the youth, it makes for a good story!</p>

<p><p class=date>8:48 pm</p>

<p><p>Stopped and got food and peeed.  now we leave again. I&rsquo;ve been driving.</p>

<p><p class=date>11:57 pm</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;ve stopped in Gainseville and stopped in Mconald&rsquo;s. There was a big
bus labeled Baptist something and there were lots of peeps in McDonald&rsquo;s.
So, in a not quite harassing way, Patrick and Ryan and Psycho all decide to
start kissing in front of them.  That&rsquo;s what they claimed after I emerged
from my quick potty break.</p>

<p><p>Now Evelyn is driving and I&rsquo;m super glad to not be driving anymore.</p>

<p><p>I drove 325 miles since this morn.. um, since I got the van earlier today
plus a few miles.</p>

<p><p>Anyway it was nice to have Susie as the other van driver, someone else
who was focused on the road, effectively keeping me company even when we
didn&rsquo;t speak on the radio.</p>

<p><p>Now it&rsquo;s 138 miles to OKC.</p>

<p><p class=date>2:20am Saturday 2 September 2000</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;re about 90 miles from Tulsa.   Most of the youth are reciting lines
from Simpsons.</p>

<p><p>They been reciting lines for easily 30 or 45 minutes.</p>

<p><p class=date>3:16 am</p>

<p><p>We didn&rsquo;t get gas in Gainseville, while the other van did, and we&rsquo;re
kinda low..  But they aren&rsquo;t responding on the radio.   25 miles to Tulsa
and we&rsquo;re on a tollway with like no gas stations and prety much no nothin&rsquo;
at all on it.</p>

<p><p>I think we&rsquo;ll make it.</p>

<p><p>Youth conversation went from Simpsons to Amsterdam, to prisons to Malcom
In The Middle, to music, to movies,.  Ryan and Ryan are asleep; Emily
dominates the conversation now.</p>

<p><p>When either of the Ryans are awake, they will dominate the cnversation.
When they&rsquo;re both awake, they don&rsquo;t often clash; they have the &ldquo;Ryan
connection&rdquo; going on.</p>

<p><p class=date>3:25am</p>

<p><p>sixteen mles to go.</p>

<p><p class=date>3:33 am</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;re essentially in Tulsa; it seems to be a pretty spread out town.</p>

<p><p>But there are lights everywhere on the highway.</p>

<p><p class=date>3:42am</p>

<p><p>we&rsquo;re lost.</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;re parked at international golf discount deciding which way to go.</p>

<p><p class=date>3:56 am</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;ve turned around fifty million times but I think we are on the right
track.</p>

<p><p>Cute Wende is sleeping on the couch here at work.  She now has Thursdays
off from work.  She brought lunch for us from (guess where?) James Coney
Island and then she was lookin&rsquo; pretty sleepy and I encouraged her to sleep.
She was thinking 20 minutes, but it&rsquo;s been longer than that now and I don&rsquo;t
think she has stirred.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ve been chatting over AIM with a few youth and all are excited about
Tulsa Rally this weekend!!  I&rsquo;ll take copious notes. The drive to Tulsa is
pretty long too.  Longer than to Port Aransas&hellip;</p>

<p><p>Work has been cool today, but we&rsquo;ve had some weird email problems.  We&rsquo;re
sending emails to some people and some of them are getting the attachments
correctly and some are not.  They are all on the same system apparently, but
something has got to be different about the setup..</p>

<p><p class=date>5:15pm</p>

<p><p>Oh my gosh!  Laura just appeared with an enthusiastic &ldquo;boo!&rdquo; at my office
door!  How fun!!  She and Wende are talk talk talking.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m not sure about what we may do tonight; my car is at the shop and I
need to go to see Kathy Fey.</p>

<p><p>Oh!!!  I can drive Wende&rsquo;s truck and Wende and Laura can go play until
I&rsquo;m done.  That will work.</p>

<p><p>See ya!</p>

<p class=date>2:54am CDT Wednesday 30 August 2000</p>
<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>I got a postcard from my friend Suzanne, something
like, &ldquo;Rob!  I just heard that KTRU might let each DJ have his own
radio show so you can actually talk on the air!  You can say whatever
you want!  You can take callers on the air!! &ldquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>She wanted an internet connection that would allow her
to listen online.  &ldquo;But frst&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what works?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>In my dream&rsquo;s mind I answered &lsquo;DSL&rsquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>I kept reading. Her postcard included the original
message written by Meagyn, one of the DJs, who was all, &ldquo;Welcome back
from summer break.  Okay here&rsquo;s the deal: each KTRU DJ will get their
own show to do any format they want.  I&rsquo;m so excited to hear Rob get
to talk more on the air.  And who can&rsquo;t resist hearing cute Sarah talk
more on the air?</p>

<p><p class=dream>&ldquo;To answer someone else&rsquo;s question,&rdquo; she continued,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll refer you to some movie starring Sting and David Bowie.  They
used a medley of Tori Amos, mixing songs from several of her albums.
&lsquo;caught a lite sneeze&rsquo; mixed with &lsquo;god&rsquo; and &lsquo;winter.&rsquo;  So use your own
best judgement on how to do that.</p>

<p><p class=dream>On the face of the card, I realized it was not from
Suzanne, but from Vicky, one of the DJs, who had put a small picture
of herself on the card.  The picture was labeled &lsquo;Debe&rsquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>I had to go to the bathroom in my dream, so I got out
of bed where Karla and Drew (from work) and I had all been in bed
like three platonic sardines and I went to the restroom at work.
Some men had just left it a horrible mess with toilet paper all
shredded and all over the floor and toilets not flushed. and I slipped
on pee and landed beside the toilet.  Very gross and I woke up.</p>

<p><p>I had to pee.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p></p>

<p><p class=dream>Driving back to my old neighborhood, this time driving
all the way in through the front of the subdivision so I could have a
glimpse of some trains being driven backwards at 10am.  Somehow I had
seen a note written that the train would drive backwards at 10am on
the day.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I got to the model train museum, which was about a mile
from my house on Methil and the guy inside was driving a model train.
I told him I had previously lived in the area and I was here to see
the train drive backward and he was unimpressed with seeing it.</p>

<p><p class=dream>There was a small water fountain thing on a table
beside him and a small cockroach floating walking around on the water.
The guy wanted to kill the roach, but his son was adamantly opposed.
A woman who loked like Alex from Youth Council walked up and said in
her country they would eat rocahes.  I was grossed out and walked
away.  She proceeded to cut its head off and legs off and eat it.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I could hear her from the other room and she was all,
&ldquo;oooh this was terrible!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>There were balloons inflated and scattered about the
rom a bit - there had been a party apparently.  They were left over.</p>

<p><p>- - - Then I either slept more deeply or something because the next
part of this dream is the same dream, in the same building, but a few
minutes later in the dream.  I don&rsquo;t remember the few minutes.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was reading the insructions for how to rebuild the
lawnmower.  I had had problems with it not running very well.  The
instructions where quite specific.  I started reading the instruction
in the middle and was comparing the lawnmower engine to the images in
the instructions.  There were three valves and it described how they
opened in sequence and how one valve should be open while the other
two were closed.  I held one of the valves in my hand, just moving it
in its casing.  Then realized that I still had to take the carburetor
off.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I took the screw out of the carburetor and then thought
I should read the instructions.  I put the screw part way back in and
started to read from the beginning.  I looked back over at the
lawnmower and saw a small discarded roll of electrical tape lodged
between the three spark plugs!  I thought, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s the whole problem&rdquo;
and looked back over at my work bench to find something to dislodge
the tape.  I looked for something made of wood just in case there was
any residual charge on the spark plugs.  I had a vague feeling that it
was impossible for the plugs to hold a charge, but I wanted to be
safe.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I found a scrap of wood and I was hearing a hissing noise and
looked back over and three little sprays of gasoline were squirting
down out of the screw which I had not screwed all the way back in.  I
panicked and looked around for any imminent danger.  Seeing none, I
reached over and pushed the screw in and it sparked and the gas
exploded in my face.</p>

<p><p class=dream>The exposion was brief but I could feel the residual
burn in my lungs and face.  I dreaded looking at my face fearing it
would be all burned and really painful.  I woke up.</p>

<p>ATLANTIS LIFTOFF SET FOR SEPT. 8 TO OPEN DOORS TO NEW STATION MODULE</p>

<pre><code> Following a thorough review of mission preparations 
</code></pre>

<p>yesterday, the launch of Space Shuttle Atlantis has been set for
Sept. 8, on a mission that will open the doors to the
International Space Station&rsquo;s new living quarters.</p>

<pre><code> &quot;This mission begins a series of Station assembly flights 
</code></pre>

<p>aboard the Shuttle during the next year that will be as complex
and challenging as anything NASA has ever done, including landing
a man on the moon,&rdquo; Space Shuttle Program Manager Ron Dittemore
said. &ldquo;I believe these flights will be as impressive as they are
complex. The team has done a fantastic job preparing Atlantis for
this mission, and we&rsquo;re excited and ready to get started.&rdquo;</p>

<pre><code> Atlantis's liftoff from the Kennedy Space Center on Shuttle 
</code></pre>

<p>mission STS-106 will be targeted for 8:45 a.m. EDT at the opening
of a launch window that will be less than five minutes long.
During the planned 11-day flight, the crew of seven will spend a
week docked to the International Space Station, unloading more
than one and a half tons of equipment and supplies from both the
Shuttle and from a docked Russian Progress cargo craft.</p>

<pre><code> This mission will set the stage for the arrival of the first 
</code></pre>

<p>resident Station crew, planned to launch and begin living aboard
the outpost later this year.</p>

<pre><code> Terry Wilcutt will command Atlantis and Scott D. Altman will 
</code></pre>

<p>be shuttle&rsquo;s pilot. The crew also includes mission specialists
Edward T. Lu, Richard A. Mastracchio and Daniel C. Burbank.
Atlantis will also carry two cosmonauts from the Russian Space
Agency who will server as mission specialists, Yuri I. Malenchenko
and Dr. Boris V. Morukov.</p>

<p>While Atlantis is docked to the Station, Lu and Malenchenko
are scheduled to perform one spacewalk to conduct assembly tasks.</p>

<pre><code>        Atlantis is scheduled to land at the Kennedy Space 
</code></pre>

<p>Center at about 4 a.m. EDT Sept. 19.</p>

<p><p>Before Madison and I saw <em>Bless The Child</em>, we saw the trailer for
some movies, including for <a
href="https://www.areyouunbreakable.com"><em>Unbreakable</em></a>, starring
Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson, written and directed by the guy who did
Sixth Sense.</p>

<p><p>The trailer gave me chills. I&rsquo;ve watched the trailer about 6 times on the
Web and I love it each time.  This will be a great movie!!</p>

<p><p>Maggie says that the screenplay sold for more than any other screenplay
ever.  Wow!</p>

<p><p>Who buys screenplays?</p>

<p><p>Cool synchronicities today:  I finally decided to go get a quote for
fixing Scott&rsquo;s injuries.  I took him to Farr&rsquo;s Body Shop place and he said
$350 and 1 day to get it fixed.  I asked about the windshield and he said
$150.  The sum of these two prices is $500, onlly 3 dollars more than what
insurance paid me for the damages.  Nice.</p>

<p><p>Tulsa rally this weekend!!  There are two 15 passenger vans going from
Houston.  I&rsquo;m quite impressed with Miss Nicole, the youth who has been
organizing a lot of stuff for this event.  She&rsquo;s keeping track of who is
going and what youth I am advising at the rally.  So great to have her do it
so I don&rsquo;t have to!  I love youth empowerment.</p>

<p><p>Right now I&rsquo;m chillifying outside waiting for Wende to arrive from work.
She went grocery shopping and has been there a really long time, it seems to
me.  I wonder if my timer is off, or if she got a ton of food..  Or both.
Who knows?</p>

<p><p>Um, that&rsquo;s all.</p>

<p><p class=date>7:27 pm</p>

<p><p>Wende just called; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been at the grocery store long enough
to get old.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>and &ldquo;preheat the oven to 450 and we&rsquo;ll have pizza tonight!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Today we had our weekly staff meeting, and it seemed primarily like a
waste of time to me.  As a programmer I don&rsquo;t care if we use Quickbooks or
Quickbooks 2000 to log our time.  That discussion took up the most time at
the meeting.  Bluh</p>
