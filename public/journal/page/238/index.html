<p>I went to an Indian restaurant for lunch today, and was enjoying
veggie curry and nan when two, ahem, people lit up cigarettes across
from me in the restaurant.</p>

<p>I switched to gobble mode on my curry, left 80% of the nan and put on
my jacket.</p>

<p>The manager was like, &ldquo;oh would you like your tea?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I gotta go. You&rsquo;ve got two fuckers here smoking and it&rsquo;s
disgusting. I guessed you would have no smoking during lunch, but I
was wrong. Sorry about that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Why is smoking even a thing?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m trying to test the In-App Purchases for our new app, but for some
reason all the descriptions are off.  When I click this one it buys
that one and when I buy that one it buys the other one.  I thought I
had all this shit worked out.</p>

<p>##13:02</p>

<p>Got it worked out.  Apparently Apple returns the list of products in
alphabetical order instead of by the order I list them in my code.</p>

<p>I enjoy lessons with M and M because they both do lots of homework so
we can focus on exactly what they want to do, and between lessons I
can focus on exactly what I want to do.</p>

<p>Before the lesson, we agreed on the schedule for February, when I&rsquo;m
planning to go to Kagoshima for 2 weeks.</p>

<p>After the lesson, M asked me when she&rsquo;ll become fluent&hellip; and I told
her that she will need to practice speaking if she wants to speak
English more fluently.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been stopping by the toy store on the way to M&amp;M lesson on
Tuesdays.  It&rsquo;s mostly kids&rsquo; stuff, but they&rsquo;ve got a few challenging
puzzles, including three linked &ldquo;ring&rdquo; puzzles that can be taken
apart.  I solved two of them today after having solved the third
(first?) last week.  I put together a round plastic jigsaw puzzle,
which I guess was made with a laser cutter.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t think to take a picture of it.  I doubt it will be intact
next time I go back (unless they glue it together!)</p>

<p>When I left, the girl was like, &ldquo;さよなら！&rdquo; (sayonara, which means
&ldquo;see ya dunno when&rdquo;) and I was thinking &ldquo;no way, see you next week!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I updated the <code>hakyll-new-post</code> definition to give default values
for the date when I creat a new journal entry. Now instead of having
to look up the date and enter it, I just hit enter (three times) and
it enters the date components.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/9646268/194309">this answer</a> on SO, my code features <code>read-string</code> which can take default values:</p>

<pre><code>(defun hakyll-new-post (title tags yyyy mm dd)
  &quot;Create a new Hakyll post for today with TITLE and TAGS.&quot;
  (interactive (list
        (read-string &quot;Title: &quot;)
        (read-string &quot;Tags: &quot;)
                (read-string (format &quot;Year (%s): &quot; (format-time-string &quot;%Y&quot;)) nil nil (format-time-string &quot;%Y&quot;))
                (read-string (format &quot;Month (%s): &quot; (format-time-string &quot;%m&quot;)) nil nil (format-time-string &quot;%m&quot;))
                (read-string (format &quot;Date (%s): &quot; (format-time-string &quot;%d&quot;)) nil nil (format-time-string &quot;%d&quot;))
        )
           )
  (let (
    (file-name (hakyll-post-title title))
    (file-path (hakyll-post-path title yyyy mm dd))
    )
    (set-buffer (get-buffer-create file-path))
    (insert
     (format &quot;---\ntitle: %s\ntags: %s\nauthor: Rob Nugen\ndate: %s-%s-%s\n---\n\n%s\n\n&quot;
             title
         (downcase tags)
         yyyy
         mm
         dd
         (format-time-string &quot;##%H:%M %A %d %B %Y %Z##&quot;)
        ))
    (write-file
     (expand-file-name file-path (concat hakyll-site-location &quot;posts&quot;)))
    (switch-to-buffer file-name)
    ))
</code></pre>

<p>Monument Valley features fun puzzles and the most
unique+elegant+beautiful gameplay I&rsquo;ve seen in an app since that one
game where we bounce around bubbles or something.</p>

<p>(I&rsquo;d try to find a link, but I have no internet access now.)</p>

<p>Anyway, I think Monument Valley is worth $3.99 for any puzzle
enthusiast.</p>

We were walking around the kitchen / stores and a woman offered a
sample donut.  It was sticky raw on the inside but crispy on the
outside, just like the dough from which she pulled it.  She would rip
off part of the dough, including some crust and soft part inside and
fold it so that the crust would be outside.  I asked how she made them
and she showed me and I wondered if they were safe to eat, not being
cooked.  I got some other candy from a nearby place and then went back
to the corner of the room where M was sitting.

M came to SWUUSI with me though he wasn't fully "into it" as he had to
wake up early the next day and be in South Padre.  I was like, "that's
really far away, actually" so he decided to go there now and attend
SWUUSI from there.  I wasn't sure he'd have much time at SWUUSI that
way, but before I could say that his friends came up and jibed him
about a dog he had seen.  He denied it and and introduced me a bit and
I asked one of them his name.  He said Kelly or some other
could-be-a-girl's name.  I offered him some of the candy and he opened
his mouth.  Gross get it yourself.

<p>!!!!Spoilers ahead!!!!</p>

<p>I cried twice during Interstellar.</p>

<p>I was planning to cry a third time, but the movie ended too soon!</p>

<p>Overall, I wasn&rsquo;t put off by the physics.  Using gravity to move the
second hand on the watch (but not the rest of the watch) was lame, but
bearable if I replace the word &ldquo;gravity&rdquo; with &ldquo;finger coming through
5th dimension&rdquo;.  The emotional parts of the movie were pretty great,
though I was sad to see Matt Damon play a &ldquo;bad guy&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seeing the time dialation stuff in action was trippy, and well done.</p>
