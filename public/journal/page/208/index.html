<p class="dream">
Each time I tried to enter my Japanese vocabulary words, they were not
being auto-fefined by the dictionary.  I had ot write "ager-teen"
instead of "teeenager" before the translation would come up.
</p>

<p class="dream">
When discussing the event with students in my Japanese class, I
realized we hadn't tried to disprove the dust theory by throwing dust
into the air. It makes sense that dancing would kick up dust and cause
more orbs.

<p>My pong demo now spawns the ball in a random direction each time it
spawns, and spawns a new ball when the existing ball exits the game
area.</p>

play <a href="/samples/unity3d/pong/pong-without-scores/">pong without scores</a>.</p>

<p class="dream"> In an open area wher people wer playing sports, a
guy was hitting baseballs toward a wal and sometimes the balls would
go astray so I went to pick one up and throw it to him.  As I
approached it he said, "free sex if you touch my ball" so I jokingly
stopped and didn't touch it.  He recoverd the baseball and threw it
hard at me.  I flinched and didn't want to be hit so I told him to
stop, but he kept doing it.  I left the area and went back into a
hallway and he pursued me. I spoke strongly to him and some guys were
like "whoah" and stepped away, but I said to them, "go ahead" and "he
won't bother you" and he didn't, but he let them ggo by and came after
me again.  I went outside while I was hearing story about an old
Japanese yakuza guy who used to come to an area where he had lots of
girls every night, and one day he came during the day, and got pissed
off because his favorite TV show wasn't on.  That's what these rich
people are like, thinking the whole world caters to them 24/7" and as
I got outside, I thought I was free of the mean baseball guy, but then
someone pointed me out to him as he came outside.  <span
class="near-lucid">I realized I could choose not to be hurt, so I
imposed that desire on the scene and the attacker stopped,</span> but
I soon woke up.  </p>

<p>Hmmm.</p>

<p>TL;DR: in Unity3D on my computer, my app looks like this.  But after
building the app for my browser, it looks like that.</p>

<p>i.e. <a href="/samples/unity3d/ah/05-line-party/">Line Party</a> should display
lines between each piece that has fallen and has had the mouse hovered
over it since that time.</p>

<p>As Lin left this morning, she was like, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let Jennie out!&rdquo; and I
was like, &ldquo;of course!&rdquo; and I noticed that I could put the chain on the
door so it only opens this much she wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get out.  That
way she&rsquo;ll be safe and happy!</p>

<p>oh shit she getting out!  I tried to close the door to carefully hold
her without crushing her (cats hate that!) and I had her at her hips.
But then she just twisted her back legs sideways and was like, &ldquo;bye!&rdquo;</p>

<p>fuck</p>

<p>I had to fully close the door in order to unlock the chain, and by
that time she was 5 yards away, which is like 5 yard more than needed
for her to bolt quickly enough that I&rsquo;d never catch her.</p>

<p>Fuck</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;ve locked the chain again and propped the door open with my shoe
in hopes she&rsquo;ll come back before Lin does!</p>

<p>¯\＿(ツ)＿/¯</p>

<h2 id="13-35">13:35</h2>

<p>she came back.</p>

I looked up at the clock and stopped mid-sentence.  "What?  Is it
1:30am?  Oh my god I must have fallen asleep!  I can only remember
maybe 45 minutes extra, but it's been three hours!!"  I asked each one
if they fell asleep but they wer lie (shrug) "no not really" but I was
sure they were just not sure because we were all groggy.  I apologized
a lot and wondered how it could have happened!

Soness was going to drop in on a lunch meeting with some organization

I could cover her lesson in the same timeslot.  I admired her ability
to join the meeting; it wasn't something I could do, so I was like,
"sure I can teach for you!"

<p>Lesson with GG last night was great as usual.  They all did good
homework, and I got good feedback that the previous homework had been
too difficult.</p>

<p>T gave good reasoning, and I was like, &ldquo;hmmm you&rsquo;re right!!&rdquo; and
explained that in my Japanese &ldquo;book&rdquo; (Textfugu), the author said he
has cut out all the Japanese that we don&rsquo;t really need, just focusing
on the 20%.  &ldquo;I can do that for you guys, too!&rdquo;</p>
