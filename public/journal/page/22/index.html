<p>2019 is pretty easy to type because the numbers are right next to each
other on both sides of the keyboard.</p>

<p>Lin and I went to her sister&rsquo;s house for new years celebrations.  Went
to karaoke and then a Chinese izakaya (fusion?) before going to the
local shrine where some guys were burning bamboo in metal drums.</p>

<p>We arrived home about an hour before 2019 and took turns taking
showers.  (I got to wear Toru&rsquo;s clean underwear, t-shirt, and dress
shirt.  Thank goodness because mine smelled like smoke after the
restaurant.)  All clean, Charu arrived back in the living room at
23:59:48.</p>

<p>Happy New Year!  Hugs all around and a kiss for Lin then headed home
soon thereafter.</p>

<pre><code>Dear Rob,


Glad to see you email. I have gone through the website and there
are a lot of improvement which can be done. Please check one of
our Hugo based website - https://www.nathanaherne.com – If you’ll
see on Home page – we have shown important section of the site
briefly and with pictures. Same I’ll propose for this website
i.e. we can show 3 or 6 Workers with Images, 3-6 Tracks, One Step
with picture.


Also, the concept of the site is totally different and unique – we
need to put few lines to let the visitors understand what the site
is all about. We need to create a good logo as well. Regarding
Support/Donations, we need to create multiple ‘Call to Action’s to
take the visitors to the support page.


Do let me know your thoughts on my initial comments and do let me
know if you are available for a video call on 3rd or 4th Jan? My
Skype id is sanjay.deligence



Thanks &amp; Regards,

Sanjay Kumar | CEO

Deligence Technologies - your growing technology partner

<p>My replies, (poorly formatted here on my site):</p>

<pre><code>HI Sanjay

Thank you for your email.  I am glad you looked at the same
carefully enough to know it is a completely unique project.  I
agree with the changes you have suggested so far.

Here are some more sections of the site I would like to be considered:

Episodes
There is one more set of pages you should see as well.  https://www.marbletrack3.com/episode/   This page is hidden from normal visitors.  I would like the design of this page to match the rest of the site, but I do not want the page to be linked from the menus.

Episodes are driven with the file at
https://github.com/marbletracks/marbletrack3.com/blob/master/data/playlists/knownvideos.toml
This file is updated with calls to Youtube API, driven by this
script https://github.com/marbletracks/go-get-video-durations

I am very happy with the way this all works.  I only want to
redesign the /episodes page to match the rest of the site.

Parts / Workers Did you see how these pages are linked between
Workers and Tracks?  For example,
https://www.marbletrack3.com/parts/caret_splitter_feeder_extension/
source code includes an array of Workers that worked on the track.
There will be many many more tracks to come, and I eventually need
a way to allow human fans/supporters of the project to suggest
names of parts.

Thanks There will eventually be many more pages available under
https://www.marbletrack3.com/thanks/ There are no pictures of
people here yet, but this section is to thank the people who have
helped me with the track.  The Sweets Party Attendants have helped
me with translations.  Two more people have helped financially,
but I do not have images / permission to show them on the site.  I
would like a page under /thanks/ to be for this general support.

Steps Under &quot;Step by Step&quot; https://www.marbletrack3.com/snippets/
my idea is not nearly finished.  If you click the first Step you
see this page,
https://www.marbletrack3.com/snippets/0010_setting_the_stage/ The
Step is a detailed description of the first video snippet in this
playlist
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KjsYc4Mb5g&amp;list=PL0osPGt21FB48UwuhtCUoi9JndC9YDHAZ

In order to drive this part of the site, I want to create a data
file similar to

I have sketched out a file at
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://github.com/marbletracks/marbletrack3.com/blob/master/static/track_listing.txt">https://github.com/marbletracks/marbletrack3.com/blob/master/static/track_listing.txt</a></p>

<pre><code>but I have not written a way to parse it nor easily populate it.
There is no way to automatically create this data file, so I need to
have a reliable way to manually add new sections to it.

I would like for each written Step to be linked to the
corresponding second of output video.

This line

0:32 &quot;candy_mama&quot; | Snake Plate Chopstick for now, will create
text on the site for Snake Plate Chopstick and link it to second
32 of the correct video https://youtu.be/2bP7Irt5hHc?t=32

I imagine this is a mini-project of its own, so I do not mind if
we do not work on it.  But I am open to questions, ideas, and
suggestions for it.

In General For this project

I would like all work to be done in the open with Pull Requests on
Github.  I want all changes to work with my current workflow: when
I git push changes to the site, they appear on the live site via
Netlify.  I understand you do not have access to my Netlify
account.  But I hope once I merge a pull request, it will work
that way.  We can start with small changes to make sure it works
in a way that is good for both of us.

blessings
- Rob
</code></pre>

<p>A few minutes later</p>

<pre><code>HI Sanjay

I have just realized I sent my email before speaking about
https://www.nathanaherne.com/

You said &quot;we have shown important section of the site briefly and with
pictures.&quot;  Instead of pictures, I want to use video clips like the
ones I have at the bottom of my existing
site. https://b.robnugen.com/art/marble_track_3/workers/snippets/quick_look_francois_installs_stage.mp4

The overall idea on Nathan's site is good, but Marble Track 3 site
must focus on the workers and not focus on me as doing the work.  I
will be semi-hidden from the project, only visible on /episodes and
git repository.


thank you
Rob

<p>Lin and I joined her sister and sister&rsquo;s daughter for a circuit of
IKEA and then buffet.  I put rechargable batteries into the cart but
tried to slow down the rate of other items coming into the cart.  Lin
wants to buy a new light but did not measure the existing space to
know how low a new light could hang.</p>

<p>Though I have not figured out how to present it, I want to have some
pages that give a complete rundown of how the workers have made Marble
Track 3.</p>

<p>At this point, under /snippets, it starts like this:</p>

<pre><code>Squarehead leads Rabby onto the set as Rabby drags a round
circular plate behind him.

Squarehead unties the ropes from Rabby. Rabby squishes Squarehead as
he heads toward the camera, knocking it off its stand.

By the time the camera is reset, Squarehead has recovered and is
pulling the ropes out from under the wooden circle.

Lil brother comes onto the set, and wonders if he’s allowed to step on
the stage. He sees his mom, and thinks better of it. Other characters
pay the stage no mind and walk all across it.

Once the characters have arrived and greeted each other, Dr Sugar
comes in and thanks everyone for being there.

Mr McGlue comes in late, and big brother tells Lil brother to wait his
turn. Big brother punches Lil brother and runs away.

Then everyone except Candy Mama and Dr Sugar run away as spooky
skeleton Garinoppi comes onto the set. Lil Brother inexplicably floats
up into the air.
</code></pre>

<p>I want the moments to be linked to specific timestamps in specific
videos online (currently, Youtube).  I also want photos of the
moments, embedded in the text.</p>

<p>I think the best way to do this will be with a data document that Hugo
can parse.  I will have to maintain the data file by hand for the
foreseeable future; I don&rsquo;t know of any other way to get the data.</p>
