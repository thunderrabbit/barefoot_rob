<p><p>This morning I asked Wende to remove a sticker from my toe.  It must have been a monster sticker, or a very stubborn one; it took her at least 5 minutes.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you done yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve gotten 6 so far.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>At the end, Wende pulled 16 stickers out of my feet.  6 were in that one toe.  Wow!</p>

<p><p>Yesterday at work, as I finally was getting down to &lsquo;normal&rsquo; work
(no longer messing with computer virus stuff), Wende called asking if
I&rsquo;d enjoy visiting Souper Salad with Molly And Will.</p>

<p><p>Totally!</p>

<p><p>Rain was tremendous as I drove home.  Sarah on KTRU was all, &ldquo;call
me with your rain reports.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I called her from home.  &ldquo;HI Sarah!  It&rsquo;s Rob.  I&rsquo;m calling with my
rain report.  It&rsquo;s raining.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, Rob!&rdquo; with playful sarcasm.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s raining so hard that I can&rsquo;t even see downtown Houston, and
we&rsquo;re only 2 miles away.  Be careful and stuff when you leave the station.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>She said she would, though was planning to visit a friends house
that she hadn&rsquo;t been to in a while.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;See you later&rdquo; and then downstairs where Molly and Will were
already here.  (They had actually arrived just after I pulled in)</p>

<p><p>Souper Salad is great fun salad buffet place to eat.  But now, they
had an even added super bonus!!  The Soup was now part of the same
buffet price!  And the price didn&rsquo;t even go up.  Amazing!</p>

<p><p>I bet they move about the same amount of soup and salad through,
but have happier customers with greater variety!  I loved it.</p>

<p><p>During dinner Will described two bugs he had found in some code
(rare bugs that were tricky to find) and how he fixed them.  Then the
girls dominated conversation, mostly with college roommate stories.</p>

<p><p>My final plate at dinner was peas, &ldquo;Tuna Scroodle&rdquo; (Tuna and wide
wiggly noodles), chocolate pudding, strawberry topping, animal
crackers, ice cream, pineapple topping, and little sprinkles.  Quite
lovely!</p>

<p class=date>7:25am CDT Wednesday 3 May 2000</p></p>

<p><p>This morning, Roger from our alarm company will come by and enable
our alarm to call their place if someone breaks in.</p>

<p><p>I feel almost like I&rsquo;m not trusting my higher self / guides to keep
unwanted people out.  For 10.5 years at my apartment, we never had a
burglary.  Why should it be different at my house?</p>

<p><p>I trust that it cannot hurt to add an alarm to the house, unless
someone &hellip; well, no - I don&rsquo;t see any reason not to do it.</p>

<p><p>I just realized, we&rsquo;ll have to think of a secret word so that when
they call to see if there&rsquo;s a problem, we can say &ldquo;Shazbat&rdquo; and they
will know it&rsquo;s all good.  Or maybe &ldquo;Pulp Fiction&rdquo; or &ldquo;Pull my finger&rdquo;..  Hmmm</p>

<p class=date>7:12am CDT Wednesday 3 May 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Last night in the wee hours my dream took me to my old apartment.
I felt as if I were going home and then realized, whoah!  this isn&rsquo;t
my home anymore.  In my dream I tried to act cool as if I were
just coming to check out the progress on the apartment.</p>

<p><p>Ex-landlord Mark was happy to show me around.  Walked in and the
first thing I noticed is that the yellow walls / blue ceiling look
(which Wende painted in the bedroom) had been extended through the
entire apartment.  The hardwood floor was all sanded and beautiful -
plenty of space to slide around in our socks.</p>

<p><p>Walked into the bathroom and the tub/shower was all retiled and had
a chandelier hanging over it.</p>

<p><p>In the living room, an entertainment center was built into the wall
with a large flat screen TV built into that.</p>

<p><p>Into the bedroom, huge huge bedroom with a balcony overlooking an
old growth rainforest.  Rope bridge over to a huge platform patio
thing built around a tree.  The look was similar to where the Ewoks
lived in the third Star Wars Movie.</p>

<p><p>From there the apartment aspect of my dream faded and I woke up.</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>This morning I dreamt about youth advising (I dream youth advisor
stuff every night).  This night I was at a continental level youth
event, and I caught two youth smoking in the restroom.  I confronted
them myself and after much discussion, reported them to the youth
leadership of the conference.</p>

<p><p>Ultimate was great fun tonight!  The field was all mushy from the rain, causing me to slip a few times and fall a couple times.  One fall was a lovely slide and catch, slathering water/mud all up my leg and shorts and everything.</p>

<p><p>The stickers in the field were a bit worse tonight than previous nights.  I told Kat that I wasn&rsquo;t sure if my feet are getting wussy, or if the stickers are tougher or if the rain has any effect.  I quit playing after my feet and legs were pretty much tingling burning from stickers.</p>

<p><p>One might say, &ldquo;get some shoes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Pssh.  it doesn&rsquo;t hurt <em>that</em> much.</p>

<p><p>Today at work I spent a lot of time talking to Savvis, our ISP,
straightening out the three new DSL circuits we have ordered.  One for
each boss, and one for me.  Somehow they have gotten the addresses
mixed up for my bosses.   Soon soon it will be all good.</p>

<p><p>Mine is still in the works; just got a dial-tone, so it may take a
bit longer.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>I finished a new screen for our big project.  It allows the
administrators of the survey to change the users&rsquo; e/snail addresses /
name spelling / etc.  Pretty cool little screen; I learned a new
technique for pulling specific data records from the datasets.</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>Wende and I just watched last night&rsquo;s Futurama and Simpsons.  I&rsquo;m
gonna work on the images.cgi file on my site here.  See ya!!</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ve gotten lots of stuff done today!  Returned to Best Buy some
cables that Fricke said we didn&rsquo;t need when he set up our stereo,
brought lunch to Wende at work and ate lunch with her, and visited
Home Depot for some ceiling fan switches to replace the light switches
that originally controlled our ceiling fans&rsquo; power.</p>

<p><p>I had previous rearranged the light switches so they turned on and
off lights in an order that made more sense to me.  This was sometime
during last week.  I did it without turning off the power to the
lights; I got a little shock one time.</p>

<p><p>Today when wiring some of the new switches, I got a little shock
one time.  When I went upstairs to replace the fan switch in our
bedroom, I got shocked bigtime.  Vbbbbbbbbbb went electricty from hand
to hand through my arms and chest and heart and everything.</p>

<p><p>Woah.  Okay, I hear you, electricity.  I turned off the electricty
at the fuse box and took an ice-cream and cereal break.  (Two separate
bowls of goodness)</p>

<p><p>Just wanted to relay my shocking experience.</p>

<p><p>Just finished my shower after ultimate tonight.  Got about 14 pics
from the game, but I don&rsquo;t necessarily expect them to all develop
well.  Meek took most of the pics tonight.</p>

<p><p>We played another game of Over 25 -vs- Under 25 and again, the Over
25 team won.  (25 = 25 years old) Then we played a normal game and my
team lost.  Still did quite well, but we lost 9-7.  (Game is to 7
points, win by two)</p>

<p><p>After just those 2 games (plus 1 this morning), I decided to go
home.  My feet are just a tad tender now.  (I play barefoot)</p>

<p><p>Have a great night!</p>

<p><p>Wende is at work all day today (9am to 7pm) and I intend to do a lot around the house.  I&rsquo;ve sent out The Feel Good Net, and wrote a letter to Karen.</p>

<p><p>Now for the house, I&rsquo;m going to Home Depot to purchase some motor
&ldquo;dimmer&rdquo; switches for our ceiling fans so we can control their speed
from the wall outlet!</p>

<p><p>I also plan to flea-spray my old bed (which has been quarantined in
the garage since I moved my junque two weeks ago) and move it to the
guest bedroom.</p>

<p><p>Then maybe some more snail mail and who knows what else!</p>

<p><p>Ultimate was fun; we won.  I had some great defensive plays.  Got a
couple of pictures.</p>

<p><p>After ultimate, investment club officer meeting was good and
productive.</p>

<p><p>After meeting, came home to say HI to Wende and hopefully go eat.</p>

<p><p>After lengthy discussion, decided to walk to Walgreen&rsquo;s, drop off
film, eat at Boston Market, deposit check at bank, back to Walgreen&rsquo;s
to pick up pictures.</p>

<p><p>The plan went even more perfectly than planned: While picking up
the pictures at Walgreen&rsquo;s, Daniel was in line right in front of me!
He&rsquo;s all, &ldquo;hey Rob.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I went, &ldquo;um, hum, um, hey, uh, uh, wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Daniel.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I knew it!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Wow!  It&rsquo;s Daniel!  We hadn&rsquo;t seen each other for quite a long
time.  Introduced him to Wende and he showed us his pics from MS 150
that he just completed (Bike ride from Houston to Austin).  We showed
him the pics of Spot doing his ladder climbing trick.  Daniel loved them!</p>

<p><p>These are the pics I described of Spot climbing up the banister
like a ladder.</p>

<p><p>(I will scan them super soon, but right now Dude&rsquo;s mom in law is
staying in the computer room of their house. Hopefully this week
she&rsquo;ll split and we can commence scanning.)</p>

<p><p>Daniel came over to see our house, was greatly impressed (as are
we) and hung out for about an hour.   How great it is to see Daniel!!</p>

<p><p>If me an&rsquo; Daniel&rsquo;s friendship stays status quo, I may see him one
more time in the next few days and then not again for a year or two.
We&rsquo;ll see what happens.</p>
