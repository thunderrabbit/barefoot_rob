<p class=date>Leap Day 29 February  2000</p></p>

<p class=date>Only the second leap day of its kind!!</p>

<p><p>From <a href="https://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap000229.html">Astronomy Picture Of the Day</a>:</p>

<pre>... Julian Calendar system was used until the year 1582 when
Pope Gregory XIII added that leap days should not occur in years 
ending in "00" except if divisible by 400 ...</pre>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s pretty cool!</p>

                        <p class=date>2:22pm Tuesday <b>29 February 2000</b></p>

<p class=note>(transcribed from my diary)</p>

<p><p>This morning, laying snuggly in bed with Wende, I asked her to marry me.
 Actually I sang a cute little made up song (as I often do in the morning
for her)</p>

<p><p><pre>
Wende Wende I love you
I want you to say &lsquo;I do&rsquo;
Wende Wende you&rsquo;re the best
ten eschelons above the rest!
</pre></p>

<p><p>Few weeks ago I had jokingly said, &ldquo;Wende, marry me!&rdquo; after she had said
something cute or brought me Taco Bell or something.  She asked me, &ldquo;are
you serious?&rdquo;  At that point I was not serious.  I said, &ldquo;if I ever really
ask you to marry me, you&rsquo;ll know it&rsquo;s for real.&rdquo;
<br>At that moment I had visions of limos, flowers, studded diamond ring,
hotel, jaccuzzi, balloons &ndash; everything.</p>

<p><p>But this morning the song just arrived.</p>

<p><p>Last night I-Group was great and afterward I called Wende.  She agreed
with my hunger and asked for Taco Bell at my house.  I bought it, and as I
was pulling into the driveway with 2 tostadas, chicken chalupa, dr pepper,
and nachos with no meat, no onions and extra beans, I thought, &ldquo;if she is
here already, I&rsquo;m going to ask her to marry me.&rdquo;   She was there already.</p>

<p><p>And she came downstairs to help me carry all the goodies up and I just
felt so loved!</p>

<p><p>So in my head I was all, <em>ask her!</em>.  So I said, &ldquo;Wende, um, how
was your day?&rdquo;
<br><em>try again.</em>
<br>&ldquo;Wende, I just want to say, um, that I love you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I had visions of a movie scene with Michael Keaton as Batman trying to
tell Vicki Vale who he is.  I was flat scared to ask her.</p>

<p><p>In the large overview of our relationship, I think the big switch from
&ldquo;no plans to marry&rdquo; to &ldquo;you are the bestest greatest thing in the planet&rdquo;
happened when she experienced the Woman Within weekend.  (That&rsquo;s the
women&rsquo;s version of New Warrior, of which I am a part)</p>

<p><p>After that our communication and trust and love just flourished miles
above what it had been before.  So incredibly awesome.</p>

<p><p>I finally did not ask her last night, but told her, &ldquo;I want to marry
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>This morning we were thinking about a date.  I said, &ldquo;Leap Year 2004!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>She was all, &ldquo;nah - too close to our birthdays.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I was all, &ldquo;what about just celebrating our days old days instead of
birthdays?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I like celebrating my birthday.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>So we settled on probably my favorite day of the year, summer solstice.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;When is that?&rdquo; she asks.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;June 21st, same as always.  Everyone knows that.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yeah, summer solstice!&rdquo; she patronized, &ldquo;I knew that.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>We had already agreed that my mom will do the ceremony, and I asked if
we can do it out by a lake.  As long as we go out of the country for our
honeymoon.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Disneyworld in Florida is a different country!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>We talked about Australia or Costa Rica as possibilities.</p>

<p><p>Last night at Benihana was great great fun!!  11 people total in our
group, so we were certainly squished around the table.  Our chef Henry was
young and funny - didn&rsquo;t seem quite as skilled as the chef at the next
table, but Henry said he had only been there for 3 years, while some of the
chefs have worked there 20 years or more!</p>

<p><p>My favorite trick, which he did early in the &lsquo;show&rsquo; was cracking open an
egg:  He spun the whole egg on the cooking surface (&ldquo;ha ha Japanese egg
roll&rdquo; he said), then slipped his spatula underneath it and began to bounce
bounce bounce the egg on the spatula.  Then a deft twist of the wrist and
he caught-cracked the eggshell on the edge of the spatula, as the egg guts
splatted down to cook.</p>

<p><p>He chopped off the shrimps&rsquo; tails with lightning speed, then tossed them
behind his back into a tray.  He tossed one into the ventilation shaft
above the table!  I&rsquo;m thinking &ldquo;how often do they clean up there??&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>The night was magically fun, and oh-my-gosh Wende&rsquo;s parent&rsquo;s paid for
the whole thing.  That&rsquo;s some <em>bucks</em>.  I will write them a thank
you letter!!</p>

<p><p>After Benihana, we visited Meredith&rsquo;s house to eat cake and let Wende
open presents.  She got a drill (replacing the one that was stolen), CDs,
something else and something else. &hellip; Oh, and there&rsquo;s the crystal globes
Maggie and I got her, plus she really likes the two candles I made her.
 :-)</p>

<p><p>- - - - -</p>

<p><p>Today at work, kT introduced me to some online game site, with a
scrabble game called Wordox I think.  It&rsquo;s pretty cute - as cute as Pong
for Atari 2600.  Okay, a bit better than that.</p>

<p><p>And lastly, I&rsquo;m happy to say I&rsquo;ve got a more programming focused task of
learning SAS, the database/statistics processor of choice here at work.</p>

<p><p>OH!! And this is last - Wende&rsquo;s hours were slashed at Container Store
(everyone&rsquo;s hours were after the Elfa sale ended), so now she&rsquo;s working
part time here as well as Container Store!  Today is her first day!</p>

<p><p>Okay, today I wrote a letter to Beaner, rode my unicycle a bit
(fell and scraped my leg prett well), and just made Wende two candles!
Melted the wax in a homemade candle wax melter (pot with water, with
ozarka bottle with water in it and a tall glass candle in the water)
boiled the water, the ozarka water got hot enough to melt the wax in
the candle.  Poured the melted wax into a little ozarka bottle and the
wick is suspended in the melted wax as it cools!!  So much fun!!</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m super pleased that I finally figured out a good gift for her birthday!</p>

<p><p>I actually poured two candles: one just pure wax, and the other I
dropped little ice bits into the molten wax to see what that does.
Karla at work gave me the idea.  yay!</p>

<p><p>Oh- this is speedy cause we&rsquo;re about to go see <em>The Whole Nine
Yards</em> today with her parents.  When I started the entry, Wende
called, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re leaving; go wait outside for us to drive by and pick
you up!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>See ya!  1:24pm</p>

<p><p>Ack.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m up later than I wanted to be.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ve been having great success with my images indexer thing!
Basically I wanted to create an automagic index cgi script that would
work for image directories similar to the way I have my journal
entries indexed.</p>

<p><p>The image indexer totally kicks butt.  It&rsquo;ll kick more butt when it&rsquo;s done!</p>

<p><p>Here is the <a href="/cgi-local/images.cgi">beta version</a>.
Visit a couple of directories.  See how it draws the thumbnails and
file name below it?  Cool!  Now visit the /etc directory.  Notice how
it has not the file name, but a short description below the image!</p>

<p><p>The next step: when you click on an image, the big image will come
up with a big description below the image!</p>

<p><p>yay!  And goodnight.</p>

<p><p><em>The Whole Nine Yards</em> is great!!  I have a new
movie-actress-girlfriend, Amanda Peet.. She&rsquo;s so cute!!!  It&rsquo;s a great
comedy with great lines and visual entertainment.  (Now I can see why
I&rsquo;m not a movie critic..)  Go see the film.  Good funny stuff!</p>

<p><p>Julie, Wende&rsquo;s sister is here, being somewhat bored.  I asked if
she wants to be quoted in my journal.  She says, &ldquo;nope.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Wende&rsquo;s candles turned out well; they are cooled now.  The wax
shrank as it cooled, making the tops of the candles fairly deeply
concave.  The one in which I put ice has little caverns at the bottom.
I don&rsquo;t know where the water went..  seems to me it would be trapped
in the bottom.</p>

<p><p>Ah.  There is.  I just couldn&rsquo;t see it at first because no air
bubbles were present in the water!  Makes sense.</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>Tonight: Benihana with Wende, Julie, their mom and step-dad,
Maggie, Molly, John, Will, Eric and Merideth!</p>

<p><p>A line from Beastie Boys song &ldquo;Puttin&rsquo; Shame in Your Game&rdquo; off
<em>Hello Nasty</em> keeps going through my head:</p>

<p><p><pre>I&rsquo;m the Benihana chef on the SP12
I chop the fuck out the beats left on the shelf
You be like hello nasty where you been
It&rsquo;s time you brought the grimy beats out the dungeon
</pre></p>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s my favorite song on the album.</p>

<p><p>Oh!!!  When Wende and I first started dating like back in late
1996, she bought me a &ldquo;build your own paper clock&rdquo; for Christmas.  I
worked on it for several days then - got about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of it finished.  I
put it up in my closet when I got stuck on one piece that I glued
barely wrong and never got it back out&hellip; until today.</p>

<p><p>The coolest thing about it, besides that it seems to be perfectly
preserved; I put dates on nearly all the pieces, indicating when I put
them together.  I can practically reconstruct (no pun intended) how
the project progressed.  And, of course, when my grandkids see it:
mystery .. <em>wow - he forgot about it for 3 years</em></p>

<p><p>Course, I&rsquo;d have to have kids first.</p>

<p><p>I just woke up cleanly from a clear dream.  Wende and I were trying
to find the owner of a cat, and we went to the cat&rsquo;s apartment, which
was right down the street from me..  We had never met the people
before, but I talked to the guy about this idea I had for using the
Internet to connect people with special talents and skills.  In my
dream, he thought it was a great idea.  <em>Bing</em> I woke up.</p>

<p><p>Here&rsquo;s the idea in a nutshell: use the Internet to connect people
with special talents to people who have a project that needs those
special talents.</p>

<p><p>1) Have jillions of people visit a data collecting website and
enter their talents, skills, resources, and contact information.</p>

<p><p>2) People with a project in mind would enter what type of skills
they need for a project.  The database would present a list of
matching skills but with no names or contact information.  The project
person could then send an email to a specific email address that would
send it to each of the people in the new list.  Each individual could
respond if they were interested in the project.</p>

<p><p>There.  That&rsquo;s the project.  Now if only there was a website that
could help me find people with the following skills:</p>

<p><p><b>Project: eProjects.com</b>
<ul>
<li>someone to market the site and concept
<li>someone who can write the database and interface
<li>a server on which to host the site
<li>someone with cash to pay for the server and marketing
<li>help brainstorming how to make people <em>want</em> to visit the site and type in all their special skills
<li>help brainstorming how to jog people&rsquo;s memories of their hidden talents
</ul></p>

<p><p>Brugh Joy, MD has written at least two books.  In one of them, he described having a vision of the chapter outline of a book he would write.  He tried to put it out of his mind and sleep, but could not.  He wrote down the outline from his vision, then was able to sleep.</p>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s now 3:48am.  I&rsquo;m going back to sleep.</p>

<p class=date>5:36am CST Friday 25 February 2000</p></p>

<p><p>I couldn&rsquo;t sleep after I wrote the previous message..  not out of
astonishing giddiness, but more of a nagging things-to-do-list.  I
remembered I still had to research online brokerages for our
investment club meeting this Saturday!</p>

<p><p>Since the meeting is tomorrow, I figured I oughta get the research
out of the way ahead of time.  Instead of doing full blown tons of
info research, I looked for basics: minimum balance, cost per trade,
can we fund the account with cash or checks?, can we write checks from
the account?</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m leaning towards <a href="https://www.waterhouse.com">TD
Waterhouse</a>.  They have checkwriting, initial balance of only
$1000, $12 per trade, and local office in the Galleria area.</p>

<p><p>Plus, I already have an account there.  The club and I will both
get free trades if I refer the club to Waterhouse.  I will tell the
group upfront about this added bonus; even without it, I think they&rsquo;re
the best option we have!</p>
