<p>Super duper wonderful hugs to Wende for coming to
munch lunch with me for my 11,500th day!  She even
sent a boquet of cookies to my work.  :-)</p>

<p>We ate mission burritos and had a lovely lunch
amidst our hectic work days.</p>

<p>Thank you, Wende!!!!</p>

<p class=date>9:34pm CDT Monday 17 September 2001</p></p>

<p>At work <em>so</em> early for me 6:30am, and especially tired after
having been at work until 9pm Sunday, and then riding unicycles with
Fred last night some.</p>

<p>Conference call with Gaby from somewhere in Europe at 7am (her time
2pm), and it went really well.  She asked a bunch of questions and
Patrick and I answered them all to her satisfaction.</p>

<p>Then staff meeting at 10am, and then a second conference call at
11am, where we talked to a guy named Jon at their IT department, and
he was totally crisis mode and telling us all the problems they had
been having with their other vendor, and all this stuff.  He seemed
manic to me.  Total caffeine junkie wow.</p>

<p>I did get some programming done, but man oh man I was so tired by
3:30 that I just wanted to geo GO.  Finished one more change by 4pm,
and then started looking for another bug, but it wasn't what I
guessed, and I just left at 4:15.</p>

<p>Rode my bike home and took a nap until Spanish class, at the end of
which we talked in Spanish about our opinions etc of the events on
Tuesday.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, I find it interesting that many people I have
spoken to won't even refer directly to what happened.  Even I just
said, "the events on Tuesday" instead of "the attack on the Trade
Center," or "the destruction of the WTC."  Interesting that the
language I've been hearing tries not to refer directly to the specific
thing we're all talking about.  Even the news media is all, "attack on
America," which brings us all together as one entity, *and* keeps us
from having to replay in our minds the planes smashing into the
buildings.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I'm quite curious as to what will be the whole story as told in 20
years, and then in 50 years.</p>

<p>Why don't we spend a few billion dollars on researching solar /
wind / other power sources?  Aren't we fighting ultimately just for
the oil over there?</p>

<p>If we simply stop needing oil, wouldn't that solve a lot?  Yes, I
know that Americans are too tied to their lifestyle to turn off lights
and ride bikes to work, but I quite suggest we should reduce our need
on oil.  Not just to end a war, but to help the environment too.</p>

<p>Fred went with me to YRUU today, actually I rode
with him in his car.  He hadn't seen the cool new
entrance ramp to the woodlands.</p>

<p>YRUU was a party for Ryan's 20th birthday.  It
appears that he is supposed to be out of YRUU, but is
not.  He intends to attend San Antonio Rally; I wonder
how this will play out.  Our local YRUU needs to make
a decision about our age limits.</p>

<p>After YRUU, Fred and I took Amy home, and chilled
there with her parental units and stuff just talking
about old times and Fred's scholastic career.</p>

<p>Amy played harp for us - 2 songs plus some practice
songs for other stuff. Quite a great fun time; I
enjoyed being able to just relax for a while.</p>

<p>On the way home it started raining, so we put the
top up on Fred's car, but then we got through the rain
pretty quickly thereafter.  No worries; I was thankful
to not be stuck in traffic.</p>

<p>No Futurama on FOX today, but I woulda watched.</p>

<p>Now I'm at work, trying to get some shit finished
before having to present it at 7am tomorrow.  Not as
time crunched as some college day programming, but I'm
just stuck on this one little error.  I have emailed
Kevin for help.</p>

<p><em>Just</em> got an email.  Is it from him?</p>

<p>No.  Shit.</p>

<p>I'm going to call him.</p>

<p class=date>8:31pm</p>

<p>He'll take a look at my email and call me back.</p>

<p class=date>8:41pm</p>

<p>Ah.  Perfect.  The problem was that a dataset
seemed to be disappearing right after I created it.  I
created it in the work directory, and then tried to
read it from the work directory, and it was gone.</p>

<p>BUT!  I used two different dispatchers to create
the dataset and then to read it.  I didn't know they
had different work directories.  Actually, I didn't
know I was using different dispatchers, but now I do. 
Solution = use the same dispatcher.</p>

<p>Hopefully I'll be leaving her quite soon.</p>

<p>I woke up today and zipped to work early, worked on G3 stuff;
making sure I have all the latest source in the correct directories,
etc.  I did.  I look forward to having an easier way to track all of
that.</p>

<p>Then to the Houston NAIC meeting, where the Valueline was
discussed; how to read it, how some of the numbers are calculated.
The presenter was not incredibly well prepared, but the knew a little
bit more than I.</p>

<p>Now we're going to see <em>Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back</em>, and
then munch at Mission Burritos.  :-)</p>

<p class=date>02:43 am Sunday 16 September 2001</p>

<p>I'm pretty tired, but want to at least write highlights of the night.</p>

<p>Only Wende and I went to see the movie; she enjoyed it, and I
enjoyed it for the second time.  Then to Mission Burritos where
Maggie, Meredith and Eric were already chillin'.  We talked and then
Fred and Elise' arrived; Fred had his juggling balls and we juggled
for a while, having a great time.</p>

<p>An Art Car drove in behind Woodrow's; we went to see it.  Very tall
and silver.  Way cool.</p>

<p>Then everyone arrived at our house and we talk talk talk talk
talked and laughed and had a great time.  Elise' got in trouble with
her mom though for being out or something.  I'm not sure what the deal
was there, but Elise's mom came and picked up Elise'.  Elise' is in
college now; I think it's time to let her do whatever she wants.  But
that's just my opinion.</p>

<p>Games of the evening:  juggling, juggling between two people,
bowling a 5 inch rubber ball (contact juggling ball) at three juggling
clubs, juggling club as baseball bat, juggling club hackey sack,
balancing juggling clubs, and Fred got over 10,000 rpm on the
Powerball.  (Not the lottery)</p>

<p>Oh, and Kayse and I competed for the grand championship of spinning under
the fan.  I got 25 turns under than fan at the same speed.  She won
with 28 turns!  Yay Kayse!</p>

<p>Then Marcel and I worked on a juggling skill thing, and then
everyone left.</p>

<p>Just now for the past couple of hours, Fred has been showing me a
weird combinatorial problem.  I'm too tired to describe it, but I
-*!<em>m i g h t</em>!*- try to solve it later.  Only the bravest math
minds should ask me about it.</p>

<p>Tonight I stayed at work late, getting good stuff done on G3; I
wrote a cool procedure that will make web-entered variables safe.
It's the same concept as cleaning tainted variables in Perl or other
CGI languages.  The functionality didn't exist as far as I know in
SAS, so I wrote a little ditty that does it.</p>

<p>Still got to go in the weekend and test and move the stuff online
for the conference call at 7am on Monday.</p>

<p>problem problem problem solving at work; redesigning and reogranizing how
processes work.  Painful when it breaks, prompting this fix, but we'll be
better off in the end.</p>

<p class=date>11:43am</p>

<p>I've got the Beastie Boys <em>hello nasty</em> in my headphones; they
help me keep me focused.</p>

<p>I just tweaked some code to make it 5 times faster.  Just reading the
dataset in a speedier way.  Kevin actually came up with the fix; I just
added it to some existing code.</p>

<p class=date>5:40pm</p>

<p>During this day I have organized plans for the party-day tomorrow,
celebrating my 11500th day (Tuesday) by watching <em>Jay and Silent Bob
Strike Back</em> and munching at Mission Burritos for dinner.</p>

<p>I have also done some good development, allowing the G3 to let each
participant have his or her own timeline for going through the G3 process.
I just need to do final testing on the macros and then toss them online.</p>

<p>Conference call Monday morning at 7am to show it off.</p>

<p class=dream>In France with YRUU at an indoor swimming pool.
Floating around randomly and talking to Ryan McCarthy and other
peeps.  I decided to dive from the diving board into the deep end, and
I asked how deep it was, wondering if I was in danger of hitting the
bottom.  The youth said, "it's Tuesday deep!" because a sign on the
wall said "Tuesday" for no apparent reason.</p>

<p class=dream>I lowered myself into the water and found that in fact
it was only about calf deep.  Woah!  So the life guard turned on the
water and I could see the pool slowly filling up, but then all the
life guards had to go back into the kitchen to prepare lunch, as I was
now standing in a big empty room with flat concrete floor.  I looked
around for everyone and found some half eaten ice cream sandwiches in
the trash and some left over cake in the freezer and refrigerator.
All the youth were eating dinner in a buffet style cafeteria in the
other room</p>

<p class=dream>Somehow transitioned to me sitting in an empty room
over the highway, just near a well guarded entrance ramp.  A couple of
trucks were too tall to fit underneath the building, and they bumped
it as they passed under.  Then I was floating along the underside of
Jones hall, which was being renovated after so many years of
neglect.  I was in the back of a truck and some kid saw me and yelled,
"why don't you walk??" because somehow it was unfashionable in these
new times to take a truck.  I said, "because, I'm in a truck!" and
laughed maniacally at my wonderful humor.  He said he knew I was going
to say that.</p>

<p>Holy fucking shit the fucking world trade center
towers were just hit by two airplanes.</p>

<p>I fear the US will be directly at war.  All my
problems seem to pale at comparison.</p>

<p>I was watching as the second plane hit.  Dear god
why do humans do this to each other?</p>

<p class=date>8:26am</p>

<p>I feel sick at my stomach with fear.  The TV is on
in the background with Peter Jennings rambling that we
don't know WTF is going on, only that the other
area-airports are closed and that the president is
about to speak.</p>

<p class=date>8:41am</p>

<p>Apparently some organization has claimed
responsibility for the attack.</p>

<p>The president didn't say anything surprising.</p>

<p class=date>8:45am</p>

<p>Now DC is on the news - the Pentagon has been hit. 
Fuck that fuck that fuck that.</p>

<p class=date>8:50am</p>

<p>Airforce One is being revved up so the President
can go somewhere and hopefully not get shot down.</p>

<p class=date>8:56am</p>

<p>I just talked to Wende; we are both teary eyed. 
Our problems seem meaningless.  Jason who works with
Wende thinks that every major city in US will be
attacked today.  I told Wende that may be the case,
and that if Houston gets attacked, we planned a place
to meet.</p>

<p>I'm scared.  All this fighting about oil and
religion and just flat nothing.</p>

<p class=date>8:59am</p>

<p>All aircraft in the air in the US have been ordered
to land right now at the nearest airport.</p>

<p>I fear that all of the reactions we are exhibiting
are predictable by terrorists.  That the second
airplane hit after we were all tuned in.  That the
Pentagon would be activated next.  So they blew that
shit up.  Then the president gets in a plane and flies
somewhere.  Please let him be safe.</p>

<p>Now all planes are on the ground, or they will be
in a couple hours.  I wonder what is next.</p>

<p class=date>9:13am</p>

<p>An explosion at the capitol?  Reports are not
confirmed yet.</p>

<p>I can't imagine having to be a news anchor,
speaking calmly, having limited information, not being
able to freak out and say "FUCK!!!"</p>

<p class=date>9:21am</p>

<p>All federal buildings in washington have been
evacuated.</p>

<p>They are sending aircraft to Canada!</p>

<p class=date>9:30am</p>

<p>God damn the north tower has just collapsed. 
Fuckin' god shit. that's what they fucking wanted. 
They wanted both towers to be destroyed and they
fucking did it.</p>

<p>What can I do?  where can I go?  What can anyone
do? </p>

<p>Here at work Dennis blaringly announces the traject
news each time an event happens, though I can also
hear Peter Jennings announcement of the events.</p>

<p>"The landscape of New York City has just been
changed."</p>

<p class=date>9:41am</p>

<p>They keep trying to get people on the phone for
live eye witness coverage, but have trouble getting
cell connections working.</p>

<p class=date>9:45am</p>

<p>Highways are jammed with a "reverse commute" as all
federal employees have been sent home in
Washington.</p>

<p class=date>9:46am</p>

<p>Peter Jennings: "Possibly one or two more planes
that have been hijacked and are still missing."</p>

<p class=date>9:51am</p>

<p>767 crash in Pittsburgh has been reported.</p>

<p class=date>9:52</p>

<p>(part of the?) Top of the Pentagon has caved
in.</p>

<p>"Def Con Delta" the highest level alert in federal something.</p>

<p>I think that's what he said.</p>

<p>Dennis might be mobilized.  He's in Army
reserve.</p>

<p class=date>10:12am</p>

<p>Wende's work is closing; she's going home.</p>

<p class=date>10:30am</p>

<p>"We have always put civil liberties as a higher
priority to national defense.  This may change after
these events."</p>

<p>American Airlines confirms it lost two aircraft:

<br>flight 11: 81 passengers 9 flight attendants 1 pilot
<br>flight 77: 58 passengers 4 flight attendants 2 pilots</p>

<p class=date>10:33am</p>

<p>Canada has now shut down its entire aircraft
operation.</p>

<p class=date>10:35am</p>

<p>United airlines flight ____, a 757 newark to
SF.</p>

<p>And United Air flight 175 boeing 757 was scheduled
to LA, and it's unaccounted for.</p>

<p class=date>11:16am</p>

<p>HOV lanes and metro are open outbound - allowing
everyone out of Houston, but a full evacuation is not
announced.</p>

<p>A dozen people were reported to have jumped from
the top floors of the WTC.</p>

<p class=date>12:24pm</p>

<p>Wende just said that she had to wait in a
significant line to get gas today and that the Kroger
parking lot was filled.</p>

<p class=date>1:02pm</p>

<p>South Loop 610 is closed because a "suspicious
trailer" was seen on it.</p>

<p>Wells Fargo, El Paso, Chase Bank, Enron, 611
Walker, are buildings all closed in Houston.  Houston
is mostly evacuated.  I guess I can't go ride my bike
downtown to watch.</p>

<p>Intercontinental Airport is a spooky silent scene;
it looked less busy than 3am.</p>

<p>The suspicous trailer was just a load of furniture.</p>

<p>I took a nap after I got home, and just kept seeing the images go
through my head over and over.  From different angles than we saw on
video even - made up angles.  Like what about the guy who happened to
be at work before his normal day, sipping some coffee, looking out the
window and thinking, "my what a nice day it is today.  Holy shit that
plane is coming right toward us!"</p>

<p>The point of view of the passengers.  Crazy flight, bloodied, dead
flight attendants, dead pilot, plane veering obviously the wrong
direction, different speeds, where the fuck are we then the sudden
stop inside the building and immediately engulfed in flames.</p>

<p>As a proponent of life after death, I imagine that some of them
died and didn't know it immediately.  "Hey, we're in a building.  I'm
not in pain anymore.  Why are all these bodies all over the place?
What's with all the fire?"</p>

<p>What has the US done to make these cats so mad in the middle east?
And by cats I mean people.  They are humans just like you and me, but
somehow we have a totally different view of reality.  How is that
possible?  What has our media been feeding us that is so different
than what their media tells them?  If it was Bin Laden, he's
apparently got a ton of money; how can he be mad at capitalism, where
the whole goal is to make a ton of money?</p>

<p>Would Gore have gone to the environmental summit and said "yes, we
support helping the earth." ?  If so, would people still be so mad at
us?</p>

<p>How can I sleep tonight?  How can anyone sleep tonight?  How did we
sleep on the nights that the US was attacking people in Desert Storm?
Are we going to be at war?  Was today just the beginning?  Are there
already bombs in vans waiting outside the tallest buildings in the
biggest cities?</p>

<p>How will this be remembered in 50 years?  Is this the beginning of
the mark of the beast, where all US citizens must wear ultra unique
permanent identification to get on a plane?  Then will it spread to
the other United Nations?</p>

<p>I pray for peace.</p>
