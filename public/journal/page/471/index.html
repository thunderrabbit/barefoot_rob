<p>Today was full.  Bryn and Gram got married; I got to walk Bryn down
the aisle, which was a great honor.  They were married down by the
dock amidst much excitement and giggling.  Just after the ceremony, it
started to sprinkle a bit.</p>

<p>On the way back up to the camp, Wende's truck carried me in the
front, Bryn and Gram in the bench seat, a pile of people on the
tailgate, and Kenny riding on the step on the passenger's side of the
truck.  Good fun stuff.</p>

<p>Before the wedding, the junior high came to visit and we all had a
great water fight.  I didn't actually participate, but I watched from
the side.  Didn't want to get wet again, but we ended up all swimming,
breathing air under a submerged blue mixing bowl, and shooting lots of
water guns.  Oh, and we lost the big ball again, and the same boat
brought it back again.</p>

<p>Most unique thing was me, Lawren, Daveed under an overturned raft,
and a small fish swimming curiously slowly between us, without fear,
even though we were so close.  It was about the size of half my palm.</p>

<p>Chilled with Abbey a bit before and during dinner; talked about
some old continental level stuff we've done, and a bit about Southwest
District's attitudes toward youth.</p>

<p>Oh, Laura Nagel announced that Nathan Sexton is in jail.  D'oh.</p>

<p>Yesterday I ended up awake all night until 6:50am.</p>

<p>During touch groups, David and I ethernet connected our computers
and I got some MP3s of Amy Leyenberger harp music.  Excellent.</p>

<p>After that, the dance was great fun and extended an hour by popular demand.
Several people commented positively about my dancing technique.  :-)
Tanner and I helped teach Andrea some moves she can use to dance.
Like the extended Grocery Cart dance and the Reading A Book dance.
Good stuff.</p>

<p>Around midnight was worship, where we were asked to describe how we
wanted to be remembered.  I fell asleep for much of the worship, but
woke up just in time to light a candle in the middle and say I want
all of YRUU to know this is a tremendously difficult process for me,
choosing not to attend some rallies for a while during my visit to
Japan.  I intend to be available via email and I'll write back to
whoever writes me, but it may take a while.  <a
href="mailto:rob@robnugen.com">rob@robnugen.com</a>.</p>

<p>After sharing, we had a hug circle with lots of hugs and love.
Wonderful.</p>

<p>After worship I hung out with Erin, helping her figure out some
solutions to issues she was having.  Susie helped with that when I ran
low on ideas.</p>

<p>Watched a surprisingly variable star that was visible a tad east of
Pleiedes (sp) I think.  May have just been the atmosphere, but the
star was bright like a planet and flashing red, white, blue in the
sky.  It remained in the same location for hours and according to
Kevin, had been there multiple nights in a row.  Sounds like a planet
in brightness and stability, but I've never known a planet to randomly
flash between red, blue, white like that.  Oh and change in relatively
luminoscity (sp) as well.  Second by second it was changing color and
brightness.</p>

<p>It was 4am as I entered the mess hall and Elizabeth + Lisa were the
roving advisors.  I took over for Lisa, so she could sleep.  I chilled
in the mess hall with Jackie and Joey who were working for hours on
the mugbook.  I brought them cereal and then Elizabeth and I roved the
camp once to find many sleeping youth.</p>

<p>We found a sleeping Rob soon thereafter.</p>

<p class=date>7:47pm</p>

<p>Been chillin at Applebees with Lawren Miller, Tina Park, Sallie
West, Katie Lerner.</p>

<p>We just now got our cheese sticks with alfredo sauce.</p>

<p>Kate doesn't like to see people struggle at the
figure-out-the-rules games, so she just told Lawren the rules to Green
Glass Doors.</p>

<p>ok, so social action kicked some ass!  we moved tons of trees and i
am so hot!  i wore a friends hat and got lots of sweat on
it...oops...  i am sad that i wont see many of these people
later...like rob...he is going to be traveling :(   robs glasses are
dirty!  i am dirty!  we are all dirty!!!!   i like this new
powerbook...its way cool and much easier to type on than the visor...
later gator!  tinap-</p>

<p>hi! Rob kicks ass and so does swuusi! ~Sallie~</p>

<p>Social action was a fun time. We are having a wonderful time
chillin' at Applebees, just waiting for our food. Torrey just came
over and started to watch what I'm typing. She is a blast and a half!
"Awww, thanks!", is what Torrey just said in response. Her legs
started to hurt so she sat in Katie's seat. Now she is back. YAY!
Guess what. She wants to type something now, so I will let
her. ~Lawren Miller~ Well she said that I can still type so yay yet
again. But I'm not too sure what else to type so later Rob. He rox the
house! ~Lawren Miller~</p>

<p>hey guess who it is.. Torrey. I think  Lawren Miller was just
talking about me. Anyways... she rocks sooo much!!yeah now Lisa is
talking to me about wanting to be in Y. A. how sad. BC H.S. swuusi
rocks. I still odnt have my food yet,.... as well as Rob, Lawren,
Katie, Sallie and Tina.. so i dont feel as bad. Social Action was fun
i got all dirty and getting dirty is always the shit. Yeah so David
Mccorquodale wants to read all of this b/c he doesnt understand why i
am typing on this laptop in a restaurant. so good bye for now. *Torrey
Rowe*</p>

<p>ok, this labtop kicks ass, lily thinks swuusi also is kicking the
ass, funness is rampant at applebees.  oh yeah, im daveed.  nose you
i.  i can fog up my contacts.  i have been making air graphs of the
funness.  so far theyre beyond the scales if you mean what i know.
no? oh you will.  people are just getting their food and i finished
mine 15 minutes ago.  im at the absolutely last table to eat.  hi
katie!  the social action kicked butt.  i carried alot of sticks.  im
sooo scared of weed-wackers.  my fears were re-affirmed when the
pieces flewed-ed everywhere.  "lets play knock knock, you start!"
birthdays are rampant.  david mac signing off.  also, i couldnt
urinate  but i could pee</p>

<p>ok, so apparently it was patrick conners birthday today...uhhh, i
am pretty sure its really in feb.

shit the food~!!!!!</p>

<p class=date>9:23pm</p>

<p>I'm impressed with how well the waitstaff handled our load.  I'm
unimpressed that someone apparently wrote grouchy stuff on their
receipt, like "this place sucks" and shit like that.  But I hope that
overall the experience was great for everyone.</p>

<p>I gave a 100% tip to our waitress for my meal even though she
forgot my ice cream at first.</p>

<p>Now we're on the bus with much higher energy, I'm sure because we
had a great invigorating day, great food, and it's cooler now that
it's dark outside.</p>

<p>During lunch I shunned the advisor table to go meet some new youth.
I just met Marissa and Sarah.  Marissa apparently dances crazily like
me, according to Ellen.  I asked Sarah if this was like what she
expected.  "Yes."  ... "Laid back confusion."  Nice.</p>

<p class=date>5:53pm</p>

<p>Now we've basically finished the Ardmore cleanup.  The press we
create has been increasing each year.  Last year they had an article
in the Ardmore Press, and this year we were featured on KVII (I think
(K something II for sure)) Joan and Sean were both interviewed.  We
loaded tons of shit into a big ass dumpster, and then Matt, Aaron,
Erin and I were drumming freestyle on the desks and such in the
pile.</p>

<p>Oh, I freestyle rapped a bit, and it wasn't terrible.  That was a
first for me.  It was mostly bad, but some good.  :-)</p>

<p>Tired sweaty tired sweaty.</p>

<p class=date>6:13pm</p>

<p>On the bus now, going to Applebees as one hugemongous sweaty mass
of people filling three school buses.</p>

<p>SWUUSI!! SWUUSI!! SWUUSI!!</p>

<p>After touchgroup meeting, we're all assembled in the mess hall for
a discussion on respect.  I believe this will be regarding the "your
service sucks" notes on receipts to waitstaff at Applebee's.</p>

<p>Bryn is so incredible.  She points out that the greater issue is
that one person was able to negatively affect the entire community.
This community is all we have, and it's really important to retain its
integrity.</p>

<p class=date>11:16pm</p>

<p>Wow.  This is interesting; there seems to be another issue going on
right now.  One youth is crying and Steve + Leigh just went
purposefully outside; I wonder what the deal is.</p>

<p class=date>2:18am</p>

<p>The meeting apparently lasted 1.5 hours; I slept through most of
it, partially on Lisa Owen's leg.  She shifted cause her leg fell
asleep and I lay on my back with my computer on my chest.</p>

<p>I'm blind with one eye on Sean Bibby's hat.  And I sleep awake..
Someone, I think Kevin, has pulled the hat over my eyes, making it a
bit difficutlt to know what I'm typing.  But, on my honor, I'm going
to leave this paragraph as it was typed with me hat-folded (as opposed
o blindfolded)</p>

<p>The game is being pulled together super slowly; I don't know if it
will coalesce. Richard and Larua C are here.  At different times, we
have had Adrienne, Mike (PDIMP), Lawren, Calder.</p>

<p>Heehee; they are having a pronoun meeting inside.  "It," "You," "She,"
"He," and "I" were their names last night.</p>

<p>dwezell fucks up. Shruged a shrotum a shrotum,shrotum&hellip;heinouis,</p>

<p>it hits black hole between eyes with hat&hellip;no penace
pts. given&hellip;bitch.</p>

<p>el hefe taco with a &ldquo;k&rdquo; says &ldquo;hi&rdquo;.</p>

<p>ben gives &ldquo;sacred football&rdquo; analogy.</p>

<p>Calder gives a cue with the name she calls Mr. Dick-tator, and there
is a pronoun dance. There should so be penance points given. Rob,
you&rsquo;re getting lazy.</p>

<p>Mr Dick iis going on, and on, and on&hellip;..about Pronouns!!</p>

<p>customary &ldquo;dont forget those worm holes&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say &lsquo;here we go&rsquo;!&rdquo; Tee hee, you got away with that one Rob&hellip;</p>

<p>Too much &ldquo;Shit, dog, word.&rdquo; Must stop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, coughing noise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We is correct.&rdquo; We don&rsquo;t need no stinkin&rsquo; gramma</p>

<p>Some random entity outside the universe, possibly known as &ldquo;Bhyllx&rdquo;
says &ldquo;It scores.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That wasn&rsquo;t a fwap, it was a mosquito.</p>

<p>Dweezle loves those shrotems.</p>

<p>Mr. Dick-tator to Miss Playa Hata: &ldquo;What&rsquo;cha talkin&rsquo; about, Willis?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yeah Sexy Shorts, fwap to the other end of your worm hole, that
works. ^_-</p>

<p>They is given three chances to apologize for stealing the sacred
football</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful thing to be in a youth camp where someone apologizes
for saying &ldquo;you&rdquo; but not &ldquo;fuck you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Adrienne has a pretty damn long name which isn&rsquo;t worth typing out
here, and apparently, Rob doesn&rsquo;t find it worth getting totally
right. IE: She&rsquo;s anal about her name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Dick-tator, who is I?&rdquo; Am I the only one who saw the irony in
that statement?</p>

<p>Rob lost the football so he tips the hat. Cheater.</p>

<p>MC Spell is such a mini-PDEMP</p>

<p>What is going on? Silent Football.</p>

<p>Mr. Dick-tator, after extensive research, I have determined that the
name is &ldquo;MC Speller.&rdquo; The &ldquo;er&rdquo; is very silent, but it is there.</p>

<p>PDEMP: The sacred univers physics expert. What ever would we do with
out him?</p>

<p>Sorry, I haven&rsquo;t been taking notes for a while, I&rsquo;ve been engrossed
with iTunes and Muckafurgason. Currently, a bunch of people have
bailed out. Bunch of wimps. =P</p>

<p>during lunch scrubby scrubby my head and that was fun.  then pat pet
my back like a puppy  "oh you shaved!"</p>

<p>I clasped with both my hands her hand during the look into another's
eyes at worship.</p>

<p>Watching the lake slowly light up.  There are three youth on the
dock now.  I recognize Wes's hat, but the others I cannot identify
from this far away.  The coolest thing just flew by: a flock of about twenty
honking geese about one foot above the water's surface.  I don't know if
the picture will come out.  I barely got my camera out in time.</p>

<p class=date>6:44am</p>

<p>The three youth just walked back.  Casey is one of those I couldn't
identify.  I don't remember the name of the third.  All three are new
to SWUUSI this year.</p>

<p>This is interesting, a fourth youth <!Andrea> who came down around
6:40 waited on the road until the three youth on the dock left.  Now
that they are gone, she has entered the dock and has it to
herself.</p>

<p class=date>7:14am</p>

<p>Sean came down to wake everyone up for opening circle.  There are
four youth down closer to the lake.  They are at least awake as
opposed to Bryn and Chris.</p>

<p>I'm going up now.</p>

<p class=date>8:03am</p>

<p>At opening circle I led the Labadoo song, a new one to this
district.  It's one that I just read last week in my new games
book. Thanks to Lawren for thinking "hands on your knees" when I ran
out of appropriate verses.</p>

<p class=date>8:56am</p>

<p>"Marta is awesome, that will get you started," says Marta, to get
me started.</p>

<p>But what I was really going to say is that Senna and I
got to be a vocal musical instrument (drums) for Joan to play.  She designated
a sound for us to make when she tapped our shoulders or head.  Mine
were "pitterpatter" "boink" and "wheeee!"  Senna's were "doobeedoo"
"tssssh" (high hat) and "tickytacky"  Fun stuff!</p>

<p>Workshops now.</p>

<p class=date>11:32am</p>

<p>Creative writing workshop with Meg.  My image had a house with
wacked out bricks and an apple tree and a guy pushing a lawnmower on
top of an 18 wheeler, plus the wind blowing.</p>

<p>Then games in our touchgroup: name game with animals and pizza
toppings then an instrument game like during breakfast.</p>

<p>Then a rousing game of detective and suddenly Noah came running up
as if chased by a demon.  Busted open the door and with all
seriousness of a train wreck, "ultimate frisbee."</p>

<p>We all ran out of the cabin.</p>

<p class=date>12:19pm</p>

<p>Yay for no injuries during Ultimate!  We were smart twice this year
and (1) no people were picked last thanks to Sean splitting up six
people.  (2) played 7 players on the line (it was Jack's idea) which
gave us three subs per team and a lots more rest, safer play and all
that.</p>

<p>The teams were rather evenly picked and we had about the same score
at the end of the game.  Both teams were consistently scoring uphill.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed getting to hold Bryn's hand at worship last
night. I've been watching her interact with her boy friends and I
sometimes feel jealous of her time, but not too much.</p>

<p>I'm quite interested to listen to her stories of the past summer
that she's been working a lot.  She's in the process of saving $3000
this summer, whereas I am in the process of unsaving $5000 and not
knowing where my resources will come from, but trusting that they
will.</p>

<p>Last night, Bryn queried about my finances and i told her that I
mostly had no idea where my money would come from, she seemed to feel
quite scared for me, gave me a hug.  I told her it would really really
be okay, somehow.  I look forward to telling her my stories.</p>

<p>Last night maybe around 3am, I was woken up by Bryn's voice.  She
seemed to be crying/talking in her sleep. (her feet are twitching as
she sleeps right now)  I chose not to speak to her and either wake her
up, or interrupt her processing with Chris.  I may, however, inquire
about it today.</p>
