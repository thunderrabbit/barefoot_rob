<p>Rick told Erika to announce that the boy's bathroom needs to be
cleaned as part of her morning announcements.  So she did her
announcements and when she said "and the boy's bathroom needs to be
cleaned," Rick goes, "how do you know?"</p>

<p>And she was all, "um.." at first and then "hey!! you told me that!"</p>

<p>Hhahaahahahaha</p>

<p>Invited to lunch with Asha, Kristen, Laura, Meredith (abc order) at
Luby's.  So great to see such what good friends they are.  Learned
that Laura went to Costa Rica as an exchange student for six weeks
this summer.</p>

<p>They are quite silly, with Kristen spilling ice and Laura's phone
saying "LAURA POOPS IN THE WOODS" (thanks to Kristen probably) and all
variety of stuff.</p>

<p>Great weekend, and now I'm going to Bibby's to shower and such and
then watch <em>8 Mile</em> with Janette.</p>

<p>I went north to 635 and I-35-ish to see Ma who was staying up with
the minister from Horizon UU.  Told her the whole wacked out situation
and its latest twists and turns.</p>

<p>She suggested that something that might look bad is that all of my
journal entries are about YRUUers.</p>

<p>If all of my journal entries were in fact about YRUUers then I
might understand such a concern.  If all my journal entries about my
social activities were about YRUU then I might understand such a
concern.</p>

<p>How ironic that people are using my website against me.  Freedom of
speech at its fucking best.</p>

<p>I'm back at home in Dallas, (I'm just going to call the Bibby's
home until further notice) and Janette (not a YRUUer) and I are going
to see <em>8 Mile</em>, a movie that does not have any YRUUers in it,
and probably won't have any YRUUers in the audience.</p>

<p>Now we are leaving for the movie.  Ate with J and J and got them a
movie.</p>

<p class=date>12:22am CST Monday 11 November 2002</p>

<p>Fucking great excellent awesome movie.</p>

<p>Especially if you love Eminem.</p>

<p>I loved how it seemed so fucking real all the way through (not that
I know what it's like to grow up in the 313)</p>

<p>I loved how he never fucking gave up.</p>

<p>Such a brilliant battle he did at the end.</p>

<p>I'll definitely see it again.</p>

<p>I have never been so scared and laughed so much at the same time as
just now as janette was directing me while I was drivng around the
lake (very limited traffic) with my eyes closed.</p>

<p>Oh my god that was so fucking weird!</p>

<p>Try it sometime, but be careful and don't sue me if you crash.
That was wild.</p>

<p>Kellie at beside me during breakfast, put her hand on my shoulder,
"Rob!"</p>

<p>I looked ... careful not to look at nametag... "Kellie!"</p>

<p>She introduced me to her friend Krista from Toronto who met an
um-friend online in Springfield, so she's visiting to see what's up.
Reminded me of having met Crystal at the church in Springfield.</p>

<p>I noted that Irene met Nick online and they are happily married in
Australia.  So it can happen.</p>

<p>She asked specifically how stuff was going twice of me, and the
second time I mentioned the chaos around me regarding my desired
attendance at Houston Rally.</p>

<p>Jason is here!!</p>

<p>Big Climb On Rob hug and funniness hearing how he carefully chose
not to barge into the meeting all "They've got it all wrong; listen to
me this is how it is.."</p>

<p>He has the fun challenge of presenting the youth opinions at the
meeting regarding the possibility of moving SWUUSI.  All of the youth
opinions are valid and beautiful.  Some are eloquently written.  Some
more passionately use first amendment rights.</p>

<p>Jason understands their points and I'm glad that such a smart
well-spoken guy as Jason will present them.  Awesome.</p>

<p>While walking past the window from the kitchen to the hallway, Jay,
a guy who worked in the kitchen all day was all, "I'll give you this
bag of grapes for your laptop," as he held out a rather large bag of
grapes.</p>

<p>"Okay!"  and I handed him my laptop and got a bag of grapes!</p>

<p>Walked around to the other door, munching grapes with glee and saw
Kate Robinson who was all, "where'd you get those grapes?"</p>

<p>"I traded my laptop for them!!"</p>

<p>.... blank look .... "That's not a good trade.  You should probably
trade back."</p>

<p>So I did, and that's how I traded a bunch of grapes to get my
laptop.</p>

                        <p class=date>12:22pm CST Saturday 9 November 2002</p>

<p>I'm sitting in a chair beside the lunch line, which features 70
people or so.  I'm choosing not to stand in the line, but waiting for
it to diminish a bit.</p>

<p class=date>1:19pm</p>

<p>living with kT is interesting.</p>

<p>Recently, Lauuryn and kT tried to go to the mall.  Lauuryn likes
taking Lamar, kT likes taking I-35, so they went on 183 and got
thoroughly lost.  So they went on I-35 the other direction that it's
not in.  Lauuryn wanted to call Nathan, and kT was all, "no, we should
know Austin better than Nathan."  so they didn't call them and found
it after an hour.  kT bought a pillow and underwear.</p>

<p>And, Lauuryn & kT were not late to the YA potluck which featured
only Nathan, kT, and Lauurynn.</p>

<p>She and kT have lived in their apartment for a long time, and have
nothing on their walls, and though their large kitchen table has 5
chairs around it, they've only used 1 chair at a time.  kT's room
smells like cookies and feet.  Lauuryn's room is the size of a
shoebox.</p>

<p>Though they live in student housing, their neighbors are 40 and
have a baby.  Domestic violence reins, for the father locks out the
baby and mother outside on the balcony.</p>

<p>Their other neighbors habitually smoke and play games so kT &
Lauuryn can't keep their door open without the place smelling like
smoke.</p>

<p>kT ranted long and harshly for a survey, telling them where they
should put sidewalks and stuff.</p>

<p>kT hates having people within a mile of her when she rides a bike.</p>

<p>Did you see the headline? "This year UT has hired 3000 more
students to stand in front of kT's bike."</p>

<p>This weekend, Canadians are coming to visit kT, including those
with whom she has hooked up.</p>

<p>Lauuryn said, "if it was me, I'd say 'look this is the pillow is
the pillow I've got, so either sleep or don't sleep'"</p>

<p>For the next question in the interview, I should ask Lauuryn "what
is Nathan's new entreprenurial idea?"</p>

<p>Nathan is going to make these bumper stickers that will make people
around them smile.  "Smile I love you" and "you are beautiful."  These
were produced by a stack of bumper stickers that he got in college "Al
Gore is a pain in my gas" which he has cut and paste into the message
he wishes to convey.</p>

<p>"What's it like to have Nathan living in the same city, instead of
just the same country?"</p>

<p>Really really good.  And it makes kT make fun of herself because
she only hangs out with her roommate, her roommates boyfriend, and her
roommate's boyfriend's roommate.  And it makes it hard to have dinner
parties of 12 people when Lauuryn parades in with all these people,
and something about cable.</p>

<p>And Nathan and Lauuryn have seen every movie at the dollar movie
except for <em>Lilo and Stitch</em> because Nathan is really rich and
he makes Lauuryn play Dance Dance Revolution until she cries and cries
that she doesn't want to play anymore.</p>

<p>Though she has taken dance for 12 years, and Nathan is Nathan with
his funny looking feet [and mismatched socks -ed.] he can play it
better than she.</p>

<p>His feet turn out and he walks on his toes.</p>

<p>Matt Kime does a perfect impression of how Nathan walks, but no one
else can do it [except Nathan -ed.]</p>

<p>Also, Nathan is a grownup, which is good because he has a job, but
he won't wear real ties, only clip-on ties.  He owns fourteen clip-on
and one zip-up tie.</p>

<p>"Did you hear the story about how kT and her mom saw me walking
around the construction area, and by the time they got back, I was
gone, but they left me a note on my car?"</p>

<p>Maybe.</p>

<p>"Why is kT so angry all the time?"</p>

<p>She's not angry all the time, she just gets angry easily when
people make her angry, which is a lot.  Because kT is just really
impatient when she drives and people get in her way and her car is
like, "please don't hurt me" and she's like "shut up."</p>

<p>kT's car got hurt while parked under the freeway, and someone drove
their car off the freeway and knocked a part of the guardrail onto her
car and broke the windshield and stuff.</p>
