<p class=date>15 November 1998</p>
<br><font size="-1">(transcribed from my diary)</font>

<p><em>En route</em> to Tulsa. I'm driving Denise's van, and Denise & kT are asleep.  Adam is silently reading in the back. I'm in a reflective mood... healthy contemplation of my life after reading so much of <em>Science of the Gods</em>. OKC is 48 miles away.

<p>The book describes a physics that I don't really care about but I've been enjoying the paranormal and unusual events and stuff it has described.

<p>Most intriguing to me now is the life of the plant kingdom, with faeries, and elves, and the god Pan described and the devas that are the architects of each different type of plant and stuff. I can meditate and receive the gift of how to care for the lush green plant in my sunroom.

<p>I am pretty darn super excited about FlashNet! I wrote 8 emails this morning and called Carrie and Wende.  That's 10 contacts. I've got 70+ names of my friends on my list that I started last night.  And it's so wacky that I just say, "if you know someone who needs access, let me know!"

<p><hr width="20%">

<p>4:29pm Friday 13 November 1998 (10460) [note: that's how many days old I am this day]

<p>I'm driving on "something Turner Turnpike" maybe, and it's 90 miles to Tulsa and 30 miles to "free restrooms" and 45 miles to toll plaza. At least this was true 3 miles ago when I started writing. I have to pee.  That was true when I started driving over 1 hour ago.

<p>I hope the youth embrace the license plate frames that I made and am bringing. I woulda liked them better if the big bar was on the bottom.

<p>When I get back from Tulsa I'm going to make more flashnet contacts and order business cards and stuff. When I get back from Costa Rica, it's no holds barred crazy flashnet mania at my house.

<p><hr width="20%">

<p>Iraq war may happen again over weapons inspection. NPR was all talkin' about it.

<p><hr width="20%">

<p>Midnight Friday night 13 Nov 1998 (10461 on Saturday)

<p>Found my mom and Jon and hugged and called Delayna and Janette called back and I thought it was Delayna and stuff and was surprised that she needed directions to the church but gave them to her but she never showed up (Janette (nor Delayna)).

<p>Took Denise to hotel and called Delayna and figured out my error. Back to Hope Church and talked to Eric Posa and Gayle Keen.

<p><hr width="20%">

<p>7:15am Saturday 14 November 1998

<p>Last night we played Silent Football until 3am.

<p>I was dictator, with Jeremy L-N, Bryn C, Noah W, Leslie A, Ellen S, Nathan R, Adam W. Adam kept yakking and had a clear win at first but he got to 4.5 and I was just about to begin play and he kept his hand up. I was all, "Mr Adam has <em>four point five</em> points... Mr Adam." and within 10 seconds he lost.

<p>Ellen was super impressive at her knowledge of pronouns. And her memory in general was most impressive.

<p>Katy A had started playing but bowed out due to tiredness.

<p>Bryn wrote a most beautiful most flattering Ode to Rob in the Big Gray Rally Book. I was so touched.  I may scan it and put it in here.

<p>Adam has to do a report on either UU Software workshop, or all 3 workshops that he attends.

<p>We got about less than 3 hours of sleep. As the lights were off and we were layin' there, the youth kept yakking and I was all "okay everyone count silently to 100 and when you get to 100 start over."  Silence.
<br>Then Jeremy was all, "starting over"
<br>Laughter
<br>Silence
<br>Golden sleep

<p>Oh, the funniest thing: "in an unprecedented move, Mr Dictator awares Mr Jeremy 1/2 of one penance point for ..., awards Ms Bryn 1/2 of one penance point ..." and I went around the entire circle giving each player 1/2 penance point for the specific "crime" that person had been committing.

<p>Right now I'm at the service sitting beside Katy from Dallas First Church. The license plate frames are selling relatively well.  :-)  Nice.

<p><hr width="20%">

<p>2nd workshop. All the youth (almost) are here at the Spirituality workshop with Austin Roth and JoEllen Willis.  Wild to be here finally; I have anticipated this workshop for a long time, like since May at least.

33<p><hr width="20%">

<p>10am Sunday 15 November 1998 (10462)

<p>We're at OKC church after a crazy fun game of Silent Football last night where I finally suspended the game while it was all crazy and said, "YO are we playing a strict game or a crazy game?"
<br>Austin indicated clearly to Jermey that J-man was too disruptive. Game went much more smoothly after that.

<p>Nathan lost and had to fix us breakfast.

<p>This morning we left around 8 and are now at youth group at OKC. They have a cool phat room.

<p>In attendance I know Adam L, Rebecca, Devon A, Austin R, Melissa C, Bryn C, Annie B.  Class has included a Korean man named Peter who is showing us breathing techniques.

<p>Bryn C was the first volunteer.  I was impressed with her seriousness.

<p><hr width="20%">

<p>2:55pm 15 November 1998

<p>kT and I are at ACE of Clubs, as the van developed a slightly flat tier. It's only flat (although completely flat) on the bottom. We began walking at 2:20pm and found a guy at the car wash who is taking Denise and Adam to the van and to Texaco to get the flat fixed. kT and I had the option to gow with them, but have chosen to chill here with our red plastic cups of Coke and birthday woman behind the counter with voice so scratchy it almost hurts me and she's got 3 packs of Misty brand cigarettes and said, "can hardly breathe...so I'll just smoke a cigarette..." and just now said "she got a flat tire on I-35 and...I gave her 10 bucks blah blah blah" From context, I can tell it's not Denise to whom she is referring.  {HACK HACK HACK} "Really I don't have TB or nothin'"    
<br>So much make up and "woke up this morning and saw that fifth of tequila and I was all 'I'm gonna drink it' then I was all 'no I'm not I gotta work.. dammmmn!"
<br>"Girls just wanna have fun" she struts about last night and her black bra is so visible through see-through mosquito netting shirt. "gonna drink that and gonna drink some Jack and gonna drink some tequila..."

<p>I simply don't understand this lifestyle.

<p>On other weird thing is this bar is in a small shopping center with a chiropractor, a speech & occupational & physical therapy center, and a counseling center or something. Wacky.
kT says it's a front.

<p>3:45pm they just got back and Adam sat up beside me at the bar and she just told Adam that he had to be 21 to sit at the bar and kT has been there for 50 minutes.

<p>Now Adam and Denise are playing pool. We are waiting for the wrecker guy who had to go get a new tire from somewhere.

<p>kT got a picture of them playing pool. "Blackmail!  This is going on the internet!"

<p>The peoples around the bar have shifted over to the other side. I wonder if they are consciously or subconsciously moving away from us.

<p><font size="+1">Oh my gosh yesterday Delayna came over to the cabin to hang out with me! I haven't seen her in ten years!  Met her husband and Skye Blu, her little baby!! So great to reconnect with her and stuff.</font>
<br>Never saw Janette. Pooh.

<p>kT is line dancing alone. I guess that is point dancing.

<p><hr width="20%">

<p>2:30 am Monday 16 November 1998 (10463)

<p>Woke up at Denton and drove the rest of the way straight home.  No stops from Denton to Houston.

<p>Goodnight.

<p class=date>12:34 am Friday 13 November 1998</p>

<p>Back in about May, I signed up with <a href="https://www.flash.net">FlashNet</a> as my ISP.  I have absolutely loved their service and customer support.

<p>In about July or so, I became an Independent FlashNet Representative, which means I can sell FlashNet's internet service to people, and I even set up an <a href="https://www.mrlaboratories.com/flashnet/index.html">online</a> registration form.

<p>Since then, I have sold 4 accounts, just to my friends and family who happen to need internet access.

<p><em>Today</em>, I actually went to a FlashNet opportunity meeting, and met the CEO of the company, and wow! I was really impressed!

<p>This thing is so easy!

<p>"HI, (insert friend's name here). I just got started as an independent flashnet representative. If you know anyone who needs internet access, give them my number."

<p>It has been suggested that if I say that 100 times, 20 people will sign up, or know someone who signs up, and of those 20, 4 will want to become representatives too.

<p>Amazing!

<p>If you know anyone who needs internet access, send them to my 
<a href="https://www.mrlaboratories.com/flashnet/index.html">form</a>!

<p><hr width="20%" align="left">

<p>This weekend I'm going to Tulsa, Oklahoma for a conference. It's not a rally, but I'll be going to workshops and doing leadership type stuff with some of the youth.

<p>And, while I'm there, I'll go visit my friend Delayna, who I haven't seen since like 1991 at the latest!!  She was a buddy of mine in YRUU, and I look forward to seeing her and her new baby!!

<p>Have a great great day, and I'll see you next weekend!

<p>(That's "see you" in the same way that radio DJs say "see you")

<p><p>3:01 am Wednesday 11 November 1998</p>

<p><p>Wow.</p>

<p><p>I just checked my guestbook, which I call Rob&rsquo;s Guess Book, cause it&rsquo;s funny, and because it&rsquo;s anyone&rsquo;s guess who will sign it, and I was thrilled to see three new entries!</p>

<p><p>So I surfed on over to one of the the site called <a href="https://www.gigglecam.com" target="giggle">www.gigglecam.com</a> (before you click, know that I would consider the site rated R, and it has links to NC-17 and above) and holy cow, my site is like nothin&rsquo; compared to it!</p>

<p><p>Now this is normally not a concern; I see hundreds of sites that are cooler than mine, with java applets and pop up windows and dancing images and frames and all kinds of stuff, but they are all professional sites with a big budget and whatever.</p>

<p><p>This gigglecam site is, as far as I can tell, run by a husband and wife team, not for profit, and it&rsquo;s enormous!</p>

<p><p>So now I ask myself: do I want such a big site?  With images everywhere and Comic Sans MS font and colors and everything, including a consistent audience so big that Chris can ask a random question and post 25+ answers the next day???</p>

<p><p>I answer by quoting my brother out of context, &ldquo;yes, no, I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I do see that they are using Microsoft Front Page to do their site and that clearly violates several of my values, but I sure love their site!</p>

<p><p>I mean&hellip; grrr! I don&rsquo;t even know what I mean; I&rsquo;m getting pretty tired.</p>

<p><p>They&rsquo;ve got not only frames, which I have used successfully, but even a remote control! I&rsquo;ve seen that I can do that with JavaScript, but I&rsquo;ve just not done it yet.</p>

<p><p>So what is this <em>need</em> I have to do what they&rsquo;ve done? To prove that &ldquo;I can do it too&rdquo;  ???  I don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p><p>Would my site benefit from a remote control thing? I dunno, but it might be cool. They have theirs as an option; not as an automatic pop-up window, so at least I could do that.</p>

<p><p>Part of me wants to work on it now, and part of me is saying &ldquo;go to bed.&rdquo;  But the part of me that says &ldquo;do it now&rdquo; also says, &ldquo;hey if we go to bed now, we might not be inspired to do it tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Tough. go to bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>okay.</p>

<p class=date>5:35pm Wednesday 11 November 1998</p>

<p>Today I woke up way late - I cuddled tightly under the warm covers until 11am; I had been up until 4:30, and I was surprised that it felt like I was sleeping in..  well, I was, but it was only 6.5 hours.  Nevermind.

<p>Soon as I woke up, I was all, "gotta go check that crazy GiggleCam!"  and "Gotta go make a remote control for my website!"

<p>No. I gotta go grocery shopping and stuff. So I did.

<p>Then I came back and checked that crazy GiggleCam and made the remote control.  Watching Chris (aka Giggle) through the camera mounted on top of her computer monitor reminded me a lot of The Truman Show, that Jim Carrey movie from some months ago.

<p>Hmmm.  How very odd.

<p>Making the remote control was surprisingly easy. I will decide tomorrow if I think it will actually be useful on my site, and if so, make it available from my front page.

<p>I also chatted with Jen in New Hampshire and Suzanne my ex-neighbor and 3.5 hours later I was all 'putered out.

<p>Time to skate.  So I did.

                        <p><title>Skate to UH main campus</title></p>

<p class=date>5:45pm Wednesday 11 November 1998</p>

<p>Today after doing computer stuff, I decided it was high time I went skating.  (Who made that term "high time" ?)

<p>As I shut down my computer and my left hand brain, I wondered where to skate.  I wanted a challenge, and I didn't want to just skate downtown.
<br>I thought about going down Memorial Drive to the Picnic Loop in Memorial Park, but I didn't feel like messing with traffic on Memorial Drive.

<p>Not downtown, not Memorial Park... ah.. UH! Wende is there on campus; maybe I can go say HI to her.

<p>Called her up to confirm she was there and told her I might see her in a bit.

<p>"Okay!"

<p>Strapped on my skates after stretching my legs a bit, and wondered about how my ankle would hold up.  Last time I tried to skate about 1.5 weeks ago, it was like no way, jose'.  But today, it was okay.  yay!

<p>I headed straight down West Gray, which I haven't skated in a really long time. (Well, I skate West Gray to Montrose each time I skate but that is only 1 block)

<p>This time, all the way along W Gray until it split into two one way streets, Webster and Gray as it fit in with the other one way streets of downtown. The sidewalk was crappy in many places from neglect or construction, so I often found myself on the edge of the street, squeezing between oncoming traffic and the curb.

<p>Jump and leap and squat and roll roll roll I manuevered over, under, around all kinds of terrain, from grass infested sidewalk, to muddy splotches where sidewalk should be, to large wooden signs warning traffic of Road Construction Ahead. Not a single sign warned skaters of Crappy Sidewalk Ahead.  That's cool, though. I like the challenge.

<p>Along the edge of downtown I skated against traffic on Gray. That way a car doesn't sneak up behind me! I mostly stopped at red lights, but hauled through if cross traffic allowed. I skated past the taxis in line at the bus station, past where I used to turn to work at St Joseph Hospital, past it all, into a crunchy corner of downtown where the intersections have only stop signs instead of lights.

<p>Over to Pierce I veered, then across the gaping canyon of Hwy 59 that was still speeding along before rush hour started. Now I was out of downtown and into the poor neighborhood between UH and downtown.

<p>Now the sidewalks were really infested with grass, if they were even there at all.  But there was plenty of flat street on which to skate, as I was on the feeder of I-45 Southbound toward Galveston.

<p>Traffic whizzed past me and I was nervously in the far right hand lane. I wasn't going against traffic now, as I wanted to be on UH side of the highway... (I decided it wouldn't be worth crossing the highway later in order to skate against oncoming traffic now.)

<p>The sidewalk cleaned itself up and bing, I was at the intersection of Cullen, a main traffic artery to UH. 

<p>Along Cullen now, <em>push push push</em> I zipped along the sidewalk, off the curb, across a street, up the curb, <em>push push push</em> some more.

<p>Finally at Entrance 14 I found myself turning left across the street into the campus proper.  This was my part of campus. Familiar buildings and familiar expressions on people as I skated by, slowly absorbing the campus enegy.  I love this place.

<p>Over toward the big water fountain.  Not a lot of people here, so I didn't see anyone I knew. I skated to Scholars' Community, an organization on campus where I used to work.

<p>Tina, the lovely loud secretary was there, but busy talking to a student in her office with sliding glass door closed. So I waved and called her on the phone.

<p>She answered mockingly, "Scholars' Community."

<p>"May I speak with Tina Blakes, please?"

<p>"Just a moment."   She paused and changed her voice a tad deeper. "This is Tina."

<p>"HI!  This is Rob, but you're busy so I'm going to leave."

<p>"Okay..." and she told me that Rachelle had been there yesterday and that she had said HI.  Nice.

<p><hr width="30%">

<p>So I left and skated over to the bookstore to see Wende.

<p>Thankfully, she was standing at the front counter waiting for me. I would have felt uncomfortable skating sweaty stinking through the store to see her.

<p>HI!  I met her friend Kell, and Josie and someone else and Wende was all, "you stink."

<p>"Thanks!"

<p>We talked a bit more and I jokingly said I would not shower before we had dinner tonight.

<p>I left and skated off the other side of campus, where a brand new highway is being built from like I-45 toward Sugarland, I think.  The road surface was mostly complete, but still covered with debris and unused by traffic, except for a big water truck lumbering along behind me and then past.

<p>I turned right along what will be the feeder and skated along and up onto a bridge over some bayou. On the bridge was a large section of sewer pipe, unused and about 6 feet in diameter. I skated through that, of course. Up onto the bridge I noticed a ton of nails strewn across it. What had been nailed together?? Obviously there are aspects of highway bridge construction that I do not currently know.

<p>Turned around and skated down the slight incline, crouched and zipped through the pipe and turned at the intersection down toward what will be the other feeder. This "other feeder" runs along side some railroad tracks, which are in use almost all the time. What I found odd, though was the intersection kinda sloped down toward the tracks for no apparent reason.  It was a T shaped intersection, with the top part of the T being lower than the rest and tracks running along above it.  Why???

<p>Finally I decided that it must be planned so that if the intersection ever needs to become a + instead of a T, it can go right <em>under</em> the tracks!  BrillianT!  oops.

<p>Toward I-45 I skated along the clean new highway, and found the water truck being used to spray mud off from an asphalt surface where concrete will be soon.

<p>Time to head home.

<p>I wanted to get home before dark, cause it's safer, and not so cold. Oddly enough, I chose to cross I-45 in a hauling ass, scampering scared rabbit race on a crappy old crunchy broken 2 lane asphalt surface, with the possibility of speeding-home rush hour traffic behind me. <em>zzzzzzzoooommmmm</em> I half sprinted and half juggled between my skates to keep from being tripped in a rut or bump. Then up up up up a short hill I clambored, thankfully toward a light that was red.

<p>Somehow, not a single car tried to pass me. Thank you angels.
Good job, Rob.

<p>Leisurely skate along the sidewalk, which actually mostly existed on this side of the highway.

<p>As I approached downtown proper, the road I was on gets pushed over two blocks out of the way of a highway exit ramp. I didn't want to be two blocks over, but that traffic was speeding pretty quickly down the ramp.  Hmm.

<p>I decided to go for it, and actually found a lovely break in traffic after a white limousine sailed past. Nice.

<p>Past the weird road configurations of the beginning (or ending) of the HOV lane, I skated past parked cars and into downtown proper. Cool thing was that this time I was on St Joseph Parkway (it used to be called something else, but I don't remember what) and it was heavily congested with construction.

<p>I skated along the sidewalk, which abruptly ended in a hole about 8 feet deep. A construction guy saw me so I mocked falling into the hole. "whoah!"  He smiled and shrugged like, "oh well!"

<p>Ha ha that was funny.  Then my light turned green and zip zip zip zip I scampered across the street and onto the ample sidewalk beside St Joseph Hospital. The next light was still green so I just sailed across that street too.

<p>I pushed super hard to try to make one more green light before it changed and as I was just about to fly off the sidewalk into the street, I noticed that the taxi wasn't just parked, but slowly inching its way backward into my path!!!  <em>swerve</em> - <em>zoom</em> I zipped just past his bumper and across the street with the green light just turning yellow.  YES!!!

<p>Oh yes.

<p>I lazy skated for a bit and congratulated myself on slick manuevering. Pushed alongside traffic and regathered my breath for another scamper with the green lights. Whew. I recognized I was getting tired.

<p>After a bit, the lights turned green, as they seem to do, and I took off with the traffic.  I made only two lights this time (not including the one where I started) because I had to slow down a bit for a truck to turn the corner in front of me just before I careened across the intersection.

<p>Once I got out of downtown, I mostly just plodded along, having to work to jump the gaps in the sidewalk that I had easily leaped going the other direction.  I just pressed forward consistently and made it home by 5:30.

<p>5:30?  WOW!!  I made it to UH and back in 2 hours, including stopping to talk for 30 minutes, and including scoping out the new highway construction.

<p class=date>10 November 1998</p>

<p>Cool!

<p>I powered up my old PC:  486 33MhZ with 8 megs of ram, and was looking for a cool old file when I came across some of my old programs.  One is Dots, which I wrote in "The Spring of 1990" (as it says in the help menu) and I'm sure it was written in Pascal.

<p>"Dots?"

<p>To play, draw a grid of dots and each player takes turns drawing lines between adjacent dots either vertically or horizontally. When a player completes a square, that player gets a point and gets to go again.

<p>It's a fun simple little strategy game, but takes for damn ever to draw all the dots!  So I wrote a program to do it for me.

<p>I'm making the game available in my <a href="/downloads/">downloads</a> directory.

<p>If you grab it and enjoy it, please let me know!

                        <p><title>Preparation for lucid dreams</title></p>

<p class=date>6:05am Tuesday 10 November 1998</p>

<p>Over the past few weeks, Nikki and I have been chatting back and forth about god and other spiritual stuff, including astral and etheric projection.

<p>In the course of our conversations, Nikki said she writes down her dreams as soon as she wakes up, before those last fleeting glimpses vanish from her mind. Wow..  I've done that on occasion, but in the past haven't really kept up with it.  I'll make excuses like, "oh, I'll remember it," or "it takes too long to write them down."

<p>From her example, I am again inspired to do some dream journaling and to even take the time to create lucid dreams.

<p>I totally have the time to spend on such projects, and actually, I am a bit upset with myself for not spending more time since I've been intentionally not working.  Oh well. It's all good.

<p>My point? I woke up at 5am (via alarm in the middle of a dream cycle) and walked to the bank and post office (amidst a slight drizzle) to wake myself up mentally so I can go back to bed and be more likely to have lucid dreams.

<p>Good night.

<p class=date>8 November 1998</p>

<p>After church today, on a total whim, Wende and I saw <em>The Seige</em>, starring Denzel Washington, Annette Benning, Bruce Willis, and some other guy whose name I cannot remember.

<p>The whole idea that <em>that</em> could happen was really scary to me. Seeing Brooklyn under martial law made me think damn I am glad to be free. Emotion and tears ripped through me to see the concetration camp that was created. It was nuts.

<p>Denzel's character was tough and believable, although his face seemed to heal quite quickly after one particular incident.

<p>Bruce Willis played the super patriotic, testosterone driven general and it was the first role I'd seen him in where I thought, "grrrr" at his character.

<p>The scene that is shown in the previews with Bruce yelling at Denzel, "<b>RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW, I <em>AM</em> THE LAW!!!</b>" 
put me in a death-grip on Wende's hand.

<p>'twas a good movie. I'm glad it was only a movie.
</p>

<p>##2014</p>

<p>Or was it??</p>

<p>(after riots and militarized police in Ferguson, Missouri)</p>

                        <p><title>State of My Life</title></p>

<p class=date>6 November 1998</p>

<h1>STATE OF MY LIFE</h1>

<p><ol>

<p><li>After some meditation, I have determined something. My want is not "to be successful in my own business."  I already knew I don't want a full time job.  
<br>My want is to make some dollars and then have time to travel and play.</li>

<p>So I decided to become a gigilo.  Wait! no. no. just kiddin'.

<p>So I'm looking for some kind of part time consulting work - programming or HTML or whatever, and to that end I have called a couple of people and have put my want out to the universe, and now on my website.

<p>(For those keeping close tabs, I still signed the contract for the register receipt tape advertising on the Kroger stores.  One will begin on 29 December, the other like 21 January 1999.  They will each run for 12 weeks, I think.  I'll scan those and let you know how that all turns out.)

<p><li>My trip to Costa Rica is coming soon to an airport near me!!  I'm super excited about it, and will likely go purchase a camera (instead of borrowing Wende's all the time).  Hey, is Costa Rica flooded and destroyed now as I understand Honduras is? Hmmmm. That might be important to find out.</li>

<p><li>It's gettin' cold here in Houston! Cold by Houston standards -- it's around 60 degrees daily and down in the 50s at night. My cat Spot sleeps with me at night now. Today he climbed into a grocery sack and we play fought through the bag.</li>

<p><li>My ankle is getting better after I messed it up a couple weeks ago jumping over Maggie's couch.</li>

<p><li>I have almost completed my marble-track ball-clock. 
<p>"What the heck is that?" you may ask.

<p>Okay. Um, imagine, if you will, a chrome marble a bit less than one cm in diameter.  Okay, now imagine that marble on two popsicle sticks like on a train track. Tilt the sticks slightly, and it will roll down.

<p>Okay. <em>Now</em> imagine a long track of popsicle sticks with twists and turns and guard rails and a bunch of chrome marbles to roll down it.  That's the "marble-track" part of the project.

<p>Now imagine a novelty clock from like Sharper Image, that has an arm that picks up a marble at the bottom of the clock and drops that marble at the top of the clock exactly once per minute.  The clock has pathways and little levers to line up the marbles and roll them around and it keeps track of time that way. The Sharper Image version of this clock is all black plastic.

<p>My dad got such a clock a long-ass time ago for Christmas - like in the early 80s. Some time later he gave it to my brother who enjoyed it for a while, who gave it back to my dad, and he kept it for a while and then he gave it to me.

<p>I kept the little plastic levers, but I ripped out all the plain boring straight plastic track and have replaced it all with popsicle sticks, toothpicks, and two tongue depressors to hold the whole thing up.  This project started in late September, and I was 2/3rds done by mid October.  Just yesterday I began work again, and will soon complete the whole thing.  (I know the dates because I've written the date on practically each stick as I glued it on.)

<p>If I can, I'll get pictures of it and put them on the site. (It's really small, like 5x5x4 inches, so I'll have to get a close-up focusin' camera.)</li>

<p><li>I've been listening to KTRU, 91.7 Rice Radio, and it's really cool because they play all these obscure unpopular songs, so they have a small listening audience.  Therefore, whenever they give away like movie passes or whatever, I can always win! I got passes to ORGAZMO recently, and just yesterday I won passes to Happiness.  I'll go pick them up today.</li>

<p><li>SCOTT, a band featuring Kris Scott on vocals, guitar, bass, drums and keyboard, just put out a new album. It's got covers of a bunch of different bands: They Might Be Giants, Sonic Youth, Pavement, Radiohead, The Pixies, and others, plus original tunes that express a variety of moods and stuff.  Anyway, that's my plug, and if you want a copy, it's only 5 bucks and supports my friend Kris who is just getting started in the music biz. Email him <a href="mailto:bitter-boy@juno.com">here.</a>

<p><li>Oh, so I forgot to mention the reason I mentioned that is when I go to KTRU to pick up my passes, I'll drop off the latest SCOTT album and get SCOTT on the airwaves!</li>

<p><li>I wrote a resume yesterday.</li>

<p><hr align="center" width="25%">

<p><li>1:29pm same day
<br>I just picked up the passes from KTRU and while at the station
I was all, "do you have to be a student to work here?"   

<p>"No, but preference is given to students.  You might try during Christmas 
break."

<p>!!!! So I'm going to apply to be a DJ at KTRU over the holidays!  Truue!</li>

</ol>

<p>See ya!

                        <p><title>Bouncing Beanie Babies</title></p>

<p class=date>Tuesday 3 November 1998</p>

<p>Last week I didn't go to gymnastics because I hurt my ankle jumping over Maggie's couch.  I did go this week, but my ankle wasn't happy enough to do round off back handsprings on the floor.

<p>Today my heart just wasn't into tumbling.  I did several russians (russian style front flips) and 1 back hand spring.

<p>However, on the trampoline, I did a lot of fun stuff!

<p>Mostly I bounced and bounced like Thunder Rabbit does in the Sauna and I did a couple of back flips.  Then I did a ton of front flips, all in a row.

<p>Now, they weren't front flips landing on my feet each time, but front flips landing on my shoulders/back each time.  The first time I did them tonight, I was able to do 9 in a row.  I was a tad dizzy after that.

<p>The next time I did 12 in a row! 

<p>I did a couple of front handspring vaults, and a straddle vault and two (almost) stoop throughs (That's where my legs stay straight and go between my arms.)  The first one was good, but the second one I had bent knees.

<p>And then I had a delightful brainstorm.. Why not collect all the beanie babies that were strewn around the gym and bounce with them all on the trampoline?  I couldn't think of a good reason not to, so I collected 4 of them.

<p>{Boingy} {boingy} {boingy} {boingy} I went and they didn't bounce as high as I, but they boinged and binged and bounced around as I jumped.  

<p>I made up a game of seeing how few bounces I could take and bounce each of them high enough to catch all four.  (not necessarily at the same time)    After a little bit of practice, I was able to do it in 6 bounces.

<p>About 15 minutes of bouncing beanie babies was all I could handle, so I did a couple more vaults or something.. 

<p>It was about time to go home, so I did some final cool down leg stretches with Carrie (sp) who happens to live across the street from me, and went home.
