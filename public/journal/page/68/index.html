<p>Yay my game in Godot knows the names of swipes that are swiped by the
player.  I need to expand the ShapeDatabase a bit more as I have
forgotten some basic ones, but they are all defined in one spot so
it&rsquo;s easy.</p>

<p>I just got out of the lukewarm jacuzzi because it just didn&rsquo;t seem to
be getting any hotter.  The thermostat or something is broken so it
won&rsquo;t heat, so we taped a hose to the nearby shower faucet and put it
on full hot, which was too hot to touch at first, but then seemed to
get asymptotically close to the jacuzzi temperature, which never broke
32 degrees C.</p>

<p>Still had fun, and funny that the jacuzzi top float on the pool,..
floatiy enough for Rodrigo to sit on it.</p>

<h2 id="christmas-day-in-presidente-prudente">Christmas Day in Presidente Prudente</h2>

<p>At R&amp;D&rsquo;s house in Presidente Prudente, Brazil, which looks to me
like a house I would see in a movie.  Pool in the yard overlooked by
floor to ceiling
glass door/walls separating indoor and outdoor living/dining areas</p>

<p>Super sweet talking wtih Rose last night about jacks and marbles in
the street vs kids with cellphones now.</p>

<p>Jesse and Angelica joined us for dinner.  I asked about their
itinerary and learned they live in London.  I recognized an accent
only when she said &ldquo;I live in London now&rdquo; I feel silly for having
copied her accent, &ldquo;ah there it is &lsquo;I livin Londonau&rsquo;&rdquo; but she has
only been there for two years, but dang if I was not feeling nervous
in such a nice crib where I sure as heck don&rsquo;t belong do I and
wondering why I didn&rsquo;t buy 1000 BTC when it was a dollar.  Screw it no
regrets look forward love and learn.</p>

<p>Conswi is my temporary name for this game we are working on.  It&rsquo;s a
fake name with Latin influence.  Fred has a couple days off and we may
work on it together (and play Minecraft).  He has been teaching C++,
so learning another language may be fun.  I like working with my bro.</p>

that will be as easy.  I was able to add a queue to display the

<p>I completed the removal part after swipe, but now plan to refactor
code to let the pieces fall down by themselves.  It&rsquo;s good that I put
my PC away to come down and meet Lin; this way I can do the refactor
on paper first instead of trying to wing it in code.</p>

<p>But we were supposed to meet here at 11.  It&rsquo;s now 11:07 and she&rsquo;s not
here.  I will worry at noon.</p>

<p>For some reason, Fred and I called glasses goggles back when we were
kids.</p>

<p>He emailed me:</p>

<pre><code>u wanna do some minecraft? 
i'm free all the time except 10am-7pm,
dec 26-29.
</code></pre>

<p>My email to him follows:</p>

<pre><code>Yep sounds good

I will be on vacation during that time.

I lost my goggles though so I haaveto ware contacts, until I get
back to Japan and Japan gets back to work after the New Year.

Thankfully I was able to get contacts here in Brazil Fortaleza on
the night before we left for the next city which has fewer
unnaturaal resources (but far more naturaly resources)

Iam a bit sad to lose my glasses, but bah fuckit it will be
temporary until I get new ones back.

Plus we are on vacation so I dont have to do anything really.


bUTT  I want to keep working on my program.

I got to the point that I need to start making the library.  Well
almost at that point now.  I tried to output as HTML but it did
not seem to work when I loaded it on my site at
new.robnugen.com/samples/godot/v0.0.9. something I tink
/samples/godot will get you close enough but anyway the shit does
not load.  One of the files is 200MB which is like wut

Anyway, I can swipe pieces

oh heay you can run it in Godot if you download from
godotengine.org??  I will have to look for my repo (I have been
typing this entire email with my eyes closed, and no plans to
spellcheck shit, but I will epen open my eyyeyes to get the repo
for you.

github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi I think.

https://github.com/thunderrabbit/robdot_conswi

Yeah so that is the one and only correctly spelled thing in this
email.  Um, so last night and this morning I got swipes to
highlihgt and then to remove the colors.  Then this afternoon I
had a brainstorm that allowed the pieces above the removed pieces
to fall down into place perfectly.  So happy that it worked!

Now I am in the middle of adding a queue of upcoming pieces and
then will add the Shape Library thing.

but first bedtime.  THe good nws.  actually giving your
availability it might be bad news, but curious news is that we are
in siilar timezones.  We are in -3 whereas you are in -6 We might
move up an hour after our flight tomorrow but I will not know that
until tomorrow.

okay enough blind rambling for now.

pieaces out
