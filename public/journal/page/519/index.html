<p>It's raining pretty effectively.  Jason and I just
went to Mai's for about 45 minutes.  During that time
enough rain fell to fill the gutters a full foot
deep.</p>

<p>"Wow!!!!"</p>

<p>- - -</p>

<p>But even more wow than that was the story Jason
described!  He has accepted partial ownership of a
restaurant in Wimberly, (near San Marcos (near
Austin))right on the river!  The deal hasn't been
fully accepted yet, but it was proposed today, and he
should know by Monday or Tuesday.</p>

<p>The whole thing is designed to give college
students a place to work and perform music, etc.  So
totally awesome!</p>

<p>I'm exceptionally glad for this great opportunity
and expect to hear lots more wonderful stories.  And
somehow, through it all, Jason intends to keep his
stock broker license so he has that as another fun
thing to do.</p>

<p>He leaves Houston area again on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Went to Birraporetti's with Kristen to say HI to Katharine, who was
sitting with her friends Deanna (sp), someone, and Ross.  Ross worked
the lights at the show Ruthless.  Deanna played Tina's Mother in
Ruthless, and it was difficult for me to tell while she was just
sitting at the table.  When she stood up, I could see it in her
mannerisms.  I was surprised at how much deeper her normal talking
voice is from her stage/singing voice.</p>

<p>Turns out that her deeper voice is due to her being sick.  Oh.</p>

<p>Someone left, Deanna left, then Ross, Katharine, Kristen and I all
went to Katharine's apartment where Ross and I were entertained by
Katharine and Kristen singing and playing piano.  Fun for the first
30+ minutes, then I started falling asleep?  Might have been an
hour.</p>

<p>Kristen and I talked afterward (mostly about music and some KTRU
artists and different modern styles of music composition, some about
the Trade Center), until I was tired and she left.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p></p>

<p class=dream>At Katy Robinson's house, with other YRUUers there -
Natalie B, and I were trying to figure out how to run Katy's internet
connection.  It was a flash based animation thing that seemed a lot
like a Zork-type game, where the player had to do different tasks to
make the right thing happen.  Natalie and I called Kay in to ask her how
to connect, and Susie S came out and showed us.  One of the game options
was to ride a virtual roller coaster that was based on one that really
existed out by the beach in front of the house.</p>

<p class=dream>Someone wondered why we didn't just ride the actual
roller coaster instead of riding a virtual one on computer, so we went
outside, but couldn't figure out how to unlock the real roller
coaster.  Called Katy and Wende came out and said she had started the
process from inside, and we now had sixty seconds to open a drawer on
the side of the coaster, find a key and open a book, look up the code
in that book and enter the code into an alpha-numeric pager sitting on
the side there.  The pager was going off, and we had sixty seconds to
enter the correct code.  Wende looked it up and said "six one one
seven five" or whatever, and I entered lower case l's instead of 1's
for the ones.  I asked her if the code would be read by a human, who
would possibly forgive the l for 1, and she said she thought so.</p>

<p>- - -</p>

<p>My previous dream:</p>

<p class=dream>I had my car parked twice in front of a scary facility
thing, and I only had one set of keys.  I had to figure out a way
somehow to move both copies of my car with only one set of keys..  I
figured out a technique that involved loading the braces from some
structure into my car so that when I drove the other car would be
attached or something wacky like that and I had to climb the fence to
get out of the scary facility.  I was surprised to find that one of my
copies of my car was parked right in the middle of the entrance to the
facility, blocking the front gate.  I was surprised that it hadn't
been towed.  The other copy of my car was parked off toward the side.</p>

<p class=dream>Once I got the car started, I drove over to Kate's
house, where the above dream begins.</p>

<pre>
This is an e-mail from an Ensign stationed aboard the
USS Winston  Churchill...

Dear Dad,

Well, we are still out at sea, with little direction
as to what  our next priority is.  The remainder of
our port visits, which were to be  centered around max
liberty and goodwill to the United Kingdom, have all
but  been cancelled.  We have spent every day since
the attacks going back and  forth within imaginary
boxes drawn in the ocean, standing high-security 
watches, and trying to make the best of our time.  It
hasn't been that fun I  must confess, and to be even
more honest, a lot of people are frustrated at  the
fact that they either can't be home, or we don't have
more direction  right now.  We have seen the articles
and the photographs, and they are  sickening. Being
isolated as we are, I don't think we appreciate the
full  scope of what is happening back home, but we are
definitely feeling the Effects

About two hours ago the junior officers were called to
the bridge  to conduct Shiphandling drills. We were
about to do a man overboard drill when we  got a call
from the LUTJENS(D185), a German warship that was
moored ahead of us on the pier in Plymouth, England.
While in port, the WINSTON S CHURCHILL and the LUTJENS
got together for a sports day/cookout on our fantail,
and we made some pretty good friends. Now at sea they
called over on bridge-to-bridge,requesting to pass us
close up on our port side, to say  goodbye.  We
prepared to render them honors on the bridgewing, and
the  Captain told the crew to come topside to wish
them farewell.  As they were  making their approach,
our Conning Officer announced through her binoculars 
that they were flying an American flag.  As they came
even closer, we saw  that it was flying at half-mast.
The bridgewing was crowded with people as  the
Boatswain's Mate blew two whistles- Attention to Port-
the ship came up  alongside and we saw that the entire
crew of the German ship were manning  the rails, in
their dress blues.  They had made up a sign that was
displayed  on the side that read "We Stand By You".
Needless to say there was not a dry  eye on the bridge
as they stayed alongside us for a few minutes and we
cut  our salutes.  It was probably the most powerful
thing I have seen in my  entire life and more than a
few of us fought to retain our composure.  It  was a
beautiful day outside today. We are no longer at
liberty to divulge  over unsecure e-mail our location,
but we could not have asked for a finer day at sea.

The German Navy did an incredible thing for this crew,
and it  has truly been the highest point in the days
since the attacks.  It's  amazing to think that only a
half-century ago things were quite  different, and to
see the unity that is being demonstrated throughout
Europe  and the world makes us all feel proud to be
out here doing our job.  After  the ship pulled away
and we prepared to begin our man overboard drills the 
Officer of the Deck turned to me and said "I'm staying
Navy."

I'll write you  when I know more about when I'll be
home, but for now, this is probably the  best news
that I could send you.

Love you guys.

<p>I enjoy being productive at work.  I got the
project basically to a point where we can show it to
the client.  And we have three (3) phone calls with
them scheduled for Monday and Tuesday so different
people can see the site and give comments etc.</p>

<p>I've been productive today even though I spent
several minutes playing with smarterchild.  Visit <a
href="https://www.activebuddy.com">activebuddy.com</a>;
apparently they have bots for all the popular IM
things.  Oh, and if you have AIM running, you can <a
href="https://help.activebuddy.com/smarterchild/meetaim1.shtml">click
here</a> to say HI to SmarterChild now.</p>

<p class=note>(I'm sure I was going to say more, but I
found this entry unfinished when I came in the next
morning)</p>

<p>I haven't written in a while; I'm starting with
this most recent event and will maybe fill in some
blanks from previous days.</p>

<p>I showed up 30 minutes early for sign language;
otherwise I was just going to waste time on the
internet until it was time to leave.  I was the first
one in the class; just studied until others
arrived.</p>

<p>I'm thankful that I made the choice to get to class
early instead of waste time and then be late.</p>

<p>We learned signs for stand, slip, fall, lie down,
dance, jump, drive, car, boat, collision, run, walk,
clumsy, fly, get in, get out, true, false (heehee),
numbers 11-20,</p>

<p>And probably more that I'm not remembering now.</p>

<p><em>So</em> much easier than learning Spanish!</p>

<p>Speaking of Spanish, yesterday was the last class
of Spanish Four.  I've decided to not attend Spanish
Five, and go back to my I-group, which I have really
missed.  Especially with relationship changes.</p>

<p>I've felt sad/anxious/depressed/joyful alternately
when I think about being/living alone, or when I'm on
my way home to sleep in the guest bedroom instead of
with Wende.</p>

<p>We are discussing selling the house or not.  On one
hand I like it and want to keep it; and on the other
hand, if I don't live here, I'd be more quickly free
to zip off somewhere for a while.  Plus an apartment
would be cheaper (though the rent money wouldn't be
invested in a house)</p>

<p>Wende doesn't think she'd want to live here alone,
and she's concerned that if I lived here alone, I
wouldn't take care of the place well, and that would
devalue her investment.  We'll decide later.</p>

<p>I have just made the decision to rejoin my I-group
starting next week.  I wonder if I should tell them
first, or just show up.</p>

<p>I definitely need their support in my life right
now. At times things are no worries, and other times
they are not.  Right now I am at work trying to work,
but not getting anything really useful done.  I'm not
looking forward to going home - it's almost as if I'm
afraid of it.  I've been in the guest bedroom for the
past two nights, but tonight I'm a lot more sad about
it.  No longer a vacation; I really am embarking on
this solo journey to find myself.  Where am I?  How
could I be that hard to find?  Very interesting choice
of words for the search deep inside for life's own
greatest mystery.</p>

<p>I told Kevin and Karla today that I did not in fact
want eventually become a manager type person for
others, but I'd rather ride my bike across Germany, or
visit the pyramids in Egypt and Xochimilco (sp) and
other places.  What an amazing reaction they exhibited
- more like "we can work it out" than "okay, bye!"</p>

<p>Today was our last Spanish class for Spanish 4.  I
haven't been studying as much as necessary to keep up
with the class; I feel lost in the various past
tenses.  Just need some immersion to let it all sink
into my brain.  Maybe the Pimsleur CDs that I've heard
about.  Do you have an extra set I can borrow?</p>

<p>I just realized that by breaking up with Wende, we
won't be getting wedding gifts.  Interesting.</p>

<p>I have lost my keys; they might be at either
Maggie's or Molly's house.  I have looked through my
stuff pretty effectively.</p>

<p>I'm going to ride home now and go to bed bed
bed.</p>

<p>Wende and I are separating. We are both sad, and
continuing to communicate and stuff as we split
up.</p>

<p>I have never lived alone (and not been seriously
dating someone) since I got out of high school.  As a
result, I don't really know who I am. I'm choosing to
live alone and be flat single and not available for
relationship for a while.  (like a year at very
minimum)</p>

<p>On a mundane level, we intend to not sell the house
right now; one of us will live in it and the other
will be in an apartment.  It appears that I'll be
living in the house, but that's not clear yet.   For
now, we will live as roommates (I'm in the downstairs
bedroom) until we save up a few dollars so she can
move out.</p>

<p>The wedding next year is no more.  Get your plane
tickets to GA instead.</p>

<p>The decision was just made on Saturday, so we are
just beginning to sort stuff out.</p>

<p>Just spent my first night in the guest bedroom,
starting my journey with myself.  Wende slept upstairs
in the master bedroom.</p>

<p>Plan is for us to research selling the house, and
if we won't make some dollars on it now, then we'll
keep it and one of us will live here and the other
will live in an apartment.  We each are clear that
we're not in this to make money off the other, but I
am clear that I am thankful that this house will be an
investment for us; that we will together make money
when we sell it.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I get a raise at work; that may affect how
we choose to handle this.  I will make sure that my
SEP (IRA thing) will continue to receive the maximum
amount of dollars that it can.</p>

<p>I'm gonna get something to eat now.</p>
