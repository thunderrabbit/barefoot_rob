<p>Yesterday Mike was in a room next to me and he said something like,
"I would like to wake up <em>naturally</em>, but I have to use an
alarm," to explain the word naturally.  He went on to say that he
would be able to do that when he was 70, when he is retired.</p>

<p>Dude.  I wake up without an alarm most days.  I like that about
myself.  I just go to bed at a time called <em>earlier</em>.</p>

<p>Frank is watching recently recorded basketball games recorded and
sent by his mom.  He knows the outcome of all the games, but hasn't
seen the actual games.</p>

<p>I've been mostly studying, or maybe mostly watching, but pretty
close to half and half overall.  I've got the concept of particles in
my head.  Like ÇÕ and Ç and Ç… and one more that I've forgotten.
There are many of these, which basically specify how nouns are being used in sentences.</p>

<p>I can say shit like Ç⁄Ç≠ÇÕÅ@Ç∂ÇÂÇ§Ç¢Ç∂Ç…Å@NOVAÇÅ@Ç¢Ç´Ç‹Ç∑, which I think
means "I will go to Nova at 10" and breaks down as I (subject) 10 (at)
Nova (object) go.</p>

<p>This is almost certainly not exactly right, but I certainly hope
it's at least close enough that a native speaker could figure out what
I'm trying to say.</p>

<p class=dream>I was with friends in a house on the beachfront.  The
house had thick glass walls like an inch thick facing the water.
Across the water I could see a train bridge and maybe a train
station.  We were talking in the living room and suddenly there was a
large swell of waves and the waves were gushing into the house, though
they were dampened by the walls they weren't completly stopped.</p>

<p class=dream>I was afraid for the safety of my computer and asked if
the hosue would remain standing and I was assured it would.  I ran up
the hall and another wave came causing a river of water to flood down
the hall toward me.  I knew I could just stand carefully and let it
flow by.</p>

<p class=dream>I saw a friend of mine out on the beach and he was
pretty far away and possibly in dangered by the waves.  I stood by an
automatic door in the hallway and it opened; I hoped he saw it.  I
heard the yammeryammer Japanese voice greeting as the door opened.</p>

<p class=dream>After the water went by, I ran down another hall
looking for the room where I had left my computer and I went past many
rooms with science experiment looking things, or like science museum
displays that would appeal to various ages.  They were all in glass
rooms and I didn't go investigate them more fully.</p>

<p class=dream>I got to my computer and it was in a room where a
little robot was supposed to be cleaning a miniature floor.  This was
an experiment in artificial intelligence, so I knew this was "just" a
robot, but it seemed to have a good ability to speak English sensibly
if innocently.  It cleaned for a while and then the tray got more and
more full of rice, making it impossible to get everything; the robot
needed a different tool besides just a buffing wheel; it needed a
shovel.  But it kept working anyway, knowing it was doing that which
it had been asked to do.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class=dream>I got back to Kawasaki and Carla told me that she and
Benny were going to some bed and breakfast type thing down down down
somewhere and she was really looking forward to it, and I was envious
that Benny had already been so bold as to get her to go out with him,
etc even though she's been working here for years and he's been here
the same month+ that I have.</p>

<p>I'm wondering about riding my bike to work and thereby getting
exercise and 'saving' money ('saving' because I've paid 1500 to get my
bike untowed and I dunno how much to fix a flat) versus riding the
train to work and having time to study Japanese.</p>

<p>If my primary goal here is to learn Japanese, then the choice is
obvious.</p>

<p>I'm just now getting to bed (I took a phat nap after work) and I
had a flash thought.  Back in Dallas in my last couple days there I
went to the store (Target / Ross) by myself to get clothes.  That felt
like a real stretch like ooh I'm going shopping without a girlfriend
to show me what to do.</p>

<p>Compared to the shit I've been doing here...... that was
<em>nothing</em>.  Hooray for personal growth.</p>

<p>Pretty okay day at work.  Relatively straightforward.  Had one good
lesson, one great lesson, and one not so good lesson and one faux pas
in another lesson.</p>

<p>The great lesson was a man to man where she asked me specifically
for help with language to use as a telephone operator for a hotel.
She told me the situation and I gave her language like, "for the
safety of our guests, we cannot connect you unless you have their full
name or first name and room number."  and "if there is no answer,
please don't hang up and I will transfer the call to voice mail."  or
some shit like that.</p>

<p>She seemed really happy with the new phrases.</p>

<p>And she was really cute but she's too young for me I'm sure.</p>

<p>The faux pas was me bringing up this cat's daughter's birthday
tomorrow (which he had mentioned in a previous lesson) when the
current lesson was talking about manly subjects like Japanese loyalty
to companies.  But shit, he wouldn't speak up at all, so I tried to
connect with him about anything I knew.  Whatever.</p>

<p>Instead of going to get my bike tire fixed, I studied a bit and
fell asleep a lot.  Dreams filled with the concept of learning
Japanese, trying to learn Japanese, bits and pieces of words floating
around in my head.</p>

<p>Woke up naturally <em>just</em> before Frank yelled "WHAT???" in
the other room and then the washing machine beeped its 10-beep "I'm
finished" alarm.</p>

<p>In my head I wondered "what brings you joy, Frank?"</p>

<p>Soon as I got into the room he was all, "I gotta ask you a favor;
when I lose I get really angry."  He's playing Sega basketball.</p>

<p>"So what's the favor?"</p>

<p>"Just don't comment on it.  Your predecessor had to learn the hard
way."</p>

<p>"Did you kick his ass?" I ask, thinking the question is ludicrous.</p>

<p>"No; I very rarely resort to physical violence."</p>

<p>Oh, well that's nice.</p>

<p>The .... apparent accuracy of this video game is pretty amazing.
Taking into consideration number of fans the various teams draw, and
using two announcer's voices, a voice for the local announcer,
players' voices, tennis shoe squeaks, buzzer horns, advertising in the
arena... wow.   Pretty far cry from Adventure for the Atari 2600,
which I think I could still play happily.  Maybe 1 game on the most
difficult level.</p>

<p class=dream>Drew Barrymore was over somewhere like a hostel with me
and she needed to do laundry and I lived at the hostel (had just moved
in) and only residents were allowed to use the laundry facilities so I
said that she could join me doing laundry and we could both say we
were new since I was actually new they could verify the story.  She
agreed and we didn't go immediately, but I went off somewhere else to
get my laundry and then realized oh I have a laundry date with Drew
Barrymore and I ran back and she was still there which made me really
happy, but then I woke up which made me really sad.</p>

<p>(I got over it)</p>

                        <p class=date>9:02am JST Saturday 3 May 2003</p>

<p>Got a flat tire on the way to work.  One guy said I needed to walk
5km to something that would help me.  One guy a couple hundred yards
down had a tire pump.  But the tire has an unignorable leak.</p>

<p>On a bus now; should make it to work in plenty of time.  Bus cost
210 yen.</p>

<p class=date>9:15am</p>

<p>Easy shmeezy.</p>

<p>I made it to work even before the staff arrived with a key.</p>

<p>They still haven't arrived.</p>

<p>One opportunity I have now is getting *back* to my bike.  I don't
know the name of the place where it's located.  I could *walk* to it,
but I'm not sure what bus to take to get back to it quickly enough to
make it back to the place.</p>

<p>(staff is here - to be continued)</p>

<p class=date>6:12pm</p>

<p>Hmmmm</p>

<p>So I looked at the map and it appeared that this bus was going the
way I want to go, but now it doesn't seem quite as clear.  I may be
going in some wrong-ol-moosebreath direction</p>

<p class=date>8:21pm</p>

<p>Made it home.  Long walk.  Thankful to have recovered my bike.  Too
tired right now to describe how people heard me trying to communicate
with the bus driver and one girl came up with pretty good English "can
I help you?" and I tried to communicate what I could about where my
bike was located and it was so frustrating cause I know it in terms of
pictures and maps, but not in Japanese, and hardly in English cause I
don't know even the names of the streets.  I thought I knew the
highway numbers, but I was off a bit.  I thought it was Route 15, but
it was Route 140.</p>

<p>This old cat was all, "oh I'm getting off there" and it was
frustrating more because as I was realizing I had gotten on the wrong
bus, and knew where I oughta go, I was engaged with them and couldn't
just be all, "oh nevermind; I got it" cause they wouldn't understand
what I was saying.</p>

<p>So I said arigato a lot and followed this guy to another bus cause
that's what he thought was the right thing and..  really yes, he did
at least get me to the right street, and I was overjoyed when I was
all, "oh!" and I recognized where I was.  I had misguessed one thing
because I was hoping I was on the Tsunashima side of a landmark, but I
was on the other side, and then I saw another landmark and bang I was
oriented.</p>

<p>and I had a hike to get to my bike.</p>

<p>It took probably 30 minutes to get to my bike and then an hour to
get home after that.</p>

<p>Sigh.  Laura's last day was today.  Several work peeps are out
celebrating with her and ... I dunno if I want to go out or not.</p>

<p>I want to study; I'm tired; I gotta get up early.</p>

<p>I want to meet more people; I want to have a support network in the
world; I'm hungry.</p>

<p>I'll go.</p>

<p class=date>11:48pm</p>

<p>Soon as I got there, people were leaving.  Like I met them as they
were crowded around the door to get out.</p>

<p>I did meet Terry though; he seems cool and used to work at
Kawasaki.</p>

<p>Fred commented on my journal:</p>

<pre>

Dude, I have to make the hateful suggestion.  Your coworkers at Nova
probably don't read your journal yet, but IMO you have to assume that
they will eventually as they come to know you, since it's such an
integral part of your life.  You have to assume that eventually,
uncool people will read your website, and, eventually, people will see
how much you disdain Steve.  Steve is not he kind of guy who will
support your freedom of speech, and may have the power to mangle your
career.  

I can't suggest any more that you "be a good boy," because clearly
Steve is a micromanager who isn't capable of letting you make
decisions for yourself.(*) I can only suggest that you find a way to
get away from him as soon as possible, because the longer you work
under him, the more you will hate Nova specifically and your Japan
experience generally.  None of us want that.  Find the cool important
people and impress them.  See what magic they can work for you.  In
the mean time, I think you should make private the things you say
about him, lest they make trouble for you in the future.  I know you
hate to censor yourself, and I'm sure you've done an admirable job so
far--I'm sure that in your private journal there are things so
poisonous as to get you fired.  I think you need to go further and,
yes, censor more.

I've been thinking of suggesting this ever since you started talking
about Steve.  This entry seems to take things a step further than you
really want to go.  

(*)I suggest that you think of it like this:  His criticism of you
simply demonstrates his own inability to be a good manager.  He
comments on every little detail the same way Karen does because he is
incapable of helping people grow the way you have been doing for six
years and counting.  I know it grates upon everything you base your
life upon, and I'm sorry.  

I hope you are getting enough satisfaction from your interactions with
your students to overshadow your boss' poor management skills.  

Love,
g

<p>Fred is certainly far wiser about office politics than I; for the
past several years he's been studying/teaching in so many different
universities' upper eschelons that I can't quickly remember them
all.</p>

<p>This ultimately comes down to a cultural shift (journals online)
and the question just how much is too much as applied to each person's
specific case.</p>

<p>One side of me cries "free speech, beeotch!" and wants to censor
nothing.  There are actually quite few private entries in my journal
nowadays; the private ones are fun AIM chats and the like (my
definition of fun).</p>

<p>When I look at the overall larger huger picture, I see myself in
Japan for a year, and my journal online for way more many years than
that.  For some reason I am driven to lay it all out here, and am
allowing myself more freedom to do such.  Really, I want my journal to
become really wildly popular (of course!  who doesn't dream that?) and
actually generate some sort of income for myself. (*)</p>

<p>(*) mostly I want this to happen organically.  There are times when
I consider the latest amazinge money making scheme (not like "add your
name to the top of the list," but like "get $5 every time a friend
signs up for paypal" (or some other apparently reputable company)) but
ultimately I have turned down all these.  I'm open to the idea of
someone saying "hey man, I love your site; here's a million dollars,"
but I want that reason to be for me.  It's like Eddie Murphy's (main)
character in _Coming To America_; he didn't want the girl to know how
wealthy he was, he just wanted her to like him.  Wait.  It's not like
that cause I'm not heir to a nation. ..  But I know what I'm trying to
say.</p>

<p>I want my journal to be my own creation and my own representation
of my own thoughts (as any good journal should be).  I try not to
write to an audience (though I know it happens) and I'm getting better
at that, for truly I want two possibly conflicting things:</p>

<p>.) </p>

<p>Shit I just forgot both of them.</p>

<p>I want to write whatever I write, and I want people to love
*exactly* what I write.  Not because I write it for them, but because
I allow people to glimpse my world.  I don't try to create conflict
just so there's something juicy; I just live my life and the juicy
bits come up.  And I still just write in my plodding "and then I did
this. and then I did that." style.  Slowly that's changing as I learn
ways to express my emotional state.</p>

<p>Ironically I gotta go to work.  Maybe I'll get back to this.</p>

<p>Short version:  I'm not censoring.  I think I can last a year and
not tell anyone lethal in Japan about my journal.</p>
