<p>Headed to JB now soon; hopefully no big concern from the typhoon.  I
will bring my rain coat, but I ain&rsquo;t too worried.</p>

<p>The typhoon has been like a typhoon for ants.</p>

<p>But my train is nearly empty because apparently nobody came to work.
Or at least everyone left work early.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m just finishing work and heading home now.</p>

<p>Been working on my taxes for 2017.  I filed them on time, but did not
provide any list of expenses.  Now they are like &ldquo;yeah you owe $2000.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have compiled a list of expenses based on the train stations I had
to use to get to the various lessons.  Hopefully that will be enough.</p>

<p>I have been keeping better track of my expenses in 2018.</p>

<p>I contacted the organizer of TEDx Roppongi, which is scheduled for
November 3rd of this year.  I&rsquo;m not sure if I will end up helping with
that, but I&rsquo;m interested, because eventually I would like to speak on
stage at a TEDx event.</p>

<p>In other news, I&rsquo;m preparing for a workshop to be held on November
23rd, which will be an introduction to the men&rsquo;s group work that we
do.  We plan to allow only 12 new attendees to attend that workshop.</p>

<p>We have a typhoon coming apparently.  As always with typhoons in
Tokyo, I&rsquo;m not too worried.  The storms end up being less impressive
than a normal spring storm in Houston.</p>

<p>Mixed-gender group was cancelled today for the second week in a row
due to lack of attendance.  boo.</p>

<p>One of my new students paid me Friday yay.</p>

<p>(written 13:06 Wednesday 08 August 2018 JST)</p>

<p>I got a new backpack a couple of days ago.  Actually it is a hybrid
rolling backpack.  It was less than <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> price because of the color,
approximately あかむらさき &ldquo;red purple&rdquo; according to one of my magic
markers.  I would call it magenta.</p>

<p>Lin does not like the color.  I figure no one will steal it, plus it
is easy to identify in a lineup.</p>

<p>I will keep my old backpack until I travel a few times without needing
it.</p>

beds, but they will hopefully stay together okay.</p>

<p>Apparently there is a big sale on <a href="https://languagedrops.com/">Drops</a>.</p>

<p><a href="//b.robnugen.com/software/apps/drops/drops_dropped_the_price.png"><img src="//b.robnugen.com/software/apps/drops/thumbs/drops_dropped_the_price.png" alt="drops dropped the price" /></a></p>

<p>From me to Drops via their in-game help</p>

<pre><code>Pricing is incorrect in Japanese yen

0.367 yen is like US$0.00367

I can do with that price! ;-)
</code></pre>

<p>I was impressed with how quickly I got a reply!</p>

<pre><code>Hi,

Thanks for playing Drops and contacting us! We're really sorry
about any confusion and inconvenience!

What you see in the app is the price for one month in your
currency, but the total for the yearly subscription is billed as
one up-front payment for the full year at the time of subscribing.

Please, let us know if you have any question or need further assistance!
Cheers,

Kata
@ The Drops Support Team
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the best reply I can quickly write.</p>

<pre><code>HI Kata

I admire your belief that the price is right.  (If it is right, please sign me up.)

When I click on the button to buy the yearly package, it wants me to pay 4400 yen.

However, the monthly price is listed as 0.367 yen, which is not 1/12th of 4400.

The price should be listed as 367 yen per month.

   best regards
   - Rob

<li>It&rsquo;s hotter in Tokyo this summer than summers in my memory.  It&rsquo;s
been getting up to 34 - 35 degrees Celcius as the high, with some hot spots
in the 40s</li>
<li>I bought <a href="https://www.marbletrack3.com/">https://www.marbletrack3.com/</a> and have got a reasonable
start on how to display each livestream as an episode.  I started
making a page for each character, calling them workers, and even
got some translation support from Tomoko at Showspace in SCC.</li>
<li>Regarding the translation for marbletrack3.com, I only have done
the menus, and even just that is done poorly (links are still
broken)</li>
<li>But the site is open source so I can hopefully get some help from
people on <a href="https://gohugo.io">https://gohugo.io</a></li>
<li>Speaking of open source, for ConSwi programming, I often get stuck
on questions that are difficult to explain unless I can show the
source code.  I want to go back to open sourcing the code, and just

<li>Lin and I have a new bed frame but no bed.  The bed apparently did
not fit up the stairwell, but I was not there to witness it.</li>
<li>My backpack needs some more mending.  I plan to work on it later today.</li>
<li>Also later today: Meet Cathy The Relationship Artist at 5pm, have
GG lesson in Akihabara at 6:30pm, head home for Japanese lesson at
10pm, finish right on time for English lesson with Aki&rsquo;s friend Y
at 11pm.</li>
<li>I have realized that I need support promoting the men&rsquo;s circle; I
don&rsquo;t really write on FB to invite people nor even announce
upcoming interesting presentations, etc.</li>
<li>I may have found the backpack that will replace the backpack I
have had for a while and have kept repairing as it rips in various
places.</li>
