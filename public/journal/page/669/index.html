<p class=date>20 April 1998</p>
<p>
This past weekend I attended a conference called "Your Mother's Pillow," designed and run by Char Tosi, the founder of <a href=https://www.nwn.org/womanwithin/index.html>Woman Within</a>
and Marlene Nappa, who I assume helped Char design the weekend experience.
<p>
I cannot possibly convey the magnitude of healing I received during the weekend.
<p>
My understanding is that men in this culture are often never properly weaned from their mother, and never learn to find mothering, nurturing energy within themselves.  Men often seek this mothering in their adult relationships with other women.  Maybe you have experienced this. I have.
<p>
For me, the great bigpowerfulwonderful experience created a space where I could take my adolescent self back from my mother. I learned that as a man, <b>I</b> can take care of my needs and the needs of the child part of me; I don't have to seek that source of nurturing elsewhere.
<p>
The whole experience was beyond description; I keep saying that...  If you have any interest in healing childhood wounds, start with <a href=https://www.nwn.org/>New Warrior Network</a> if you are a man, and <a href=https://www.nwn.org/womanwithin/index.html>Woman Within</a> if you are a woman.<br>
Makes sense to me.
<p>
Good luck. It is hard work.

<p class=date>Friday 17 April 1998</p>
<p>
Wende is moving out soon; I am not ready for a "relationship", whatever that is.
<p>
Furthest from my mind, Jori called me two nights ago. I had met her almost two years ago and we almost had sex but didn't. We hadn't spoken since then, including when we saw each other at the laundry mat but woulndn't acknowledge each other.
<p>
One of my biggest patterns is to be in a relationship and say, "no, this one doesn't fix my life," and then move to another relationship and say, "well this one didn't fix my life <b>either</b>! Maybe I'll try this one..."
<p>
And so the cycle has continued and Wende didn't fix my life. So I'm leaving and <b>bang</b> Jori has called and I am tempted but I know only I can make me happy with my life.
<p>
Tonight I begin a weekend workshop called "Your Mother's Pillow," designed to help men work through issues with their women and their mother figures. I look forward to it with excited nervous anticipation.

<b>STATE OF MY LIFE</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>
My brother Fred and I have been working a bit on some genealogical pages here on my website.  They are not yet available for general consumption, but stay tuned.
</li>
<li>
Wende is going to move into another apartment on May 9.  We have been hanging out lately and still are friends and all that. I am certainly glad and pleased for her!
</li>
<li>
I am way likely to quit my job by 3 July 1998.  I have chosen that as the last possible date because it is just before I want to take 2 weeks off for SWUUSI and ConCon.  I will have just taken a week off for GA.
</li>
<li>
Another possible quit date is 19 June 1998.  This date is just before GA.
</li>
<li>
Another possible date is anytime now.  I've been pretty frustrated with having nothing to work on, except one crap project that is compiling as I write this.
</li>
<li>
There are 4 websites in the webring for people named Rob!  I am way excited about that!  And there are 2 sites in the queue (waiting to be part of the ring, but they haven't added the HTML to actually be part of the ring)  Yayyy!!
</li>
<li>
I am working to create a 1/4 time paid position at my church as a youth advisor.  I will soon need to make some money in ways other than working here.
</li>
<li>
I purchased a ZIP drive last night and am in the process of getting a new computer to replace the one that work gives me.  I am planning to get about a Pentium 133 with 32 megs memory and two 1 or 2 gig hard drives.  One drive will be Windoze 95 and one will be for Linux.
</li>

                        <p><title>Layouts!  almost</title></p>

<p class=date>21 April 1998</p>
<p>
Today in gymnastics after I did some stretching, but before we really got started, I did two standing back flips onto a big fat mat. Each time, I almost got all the way over. Cool. I haven't done those in years!
<p>
During our tumbling passes I was doing my round off back flips when BB said, "try doing layouts."
<p>
I was all, "err?"
<p>
He's like, "yeah.. you can do it... back flips are too easy for you now."
<p>
Layouts.  Hmmm.  So I did my next round off back flip and it was a stretched-out tuck.
<p>
I commented, "I'm not sure how it's supposed to feel for layout."
<p>
BB suggested "just point your toes and extend your legs.."
<p>
My next one was great! Not layed out, but I shouted "wow! I could really feel that was way way better!  Thanks!"
<p>
That was my best one of the night; I began to think too much and try too hard after that and they got kinda crappy.
<p>
I look forward to getting them perfect!
<p>
Once I could tell they weren't getting better that evening, I went to play on the runway tramp with Ryan, Tanya and Ashley.
<p>
Tanya is so funny, describing how her friends call her "HyperWoman" like the latest super heroine:  "HyperWoman! Quick! They need your help in China! Dig through the earth and save them!"
<p>
On the trampoline, Ryan and I traded various flips: one-and-one-quarter back flips and one-and-one-quarter or one-and-three-quarter front flips, plus high dive rolls or branny-to-back (1/2 twist one-and-one-quarter back flip) or whatever we want. I have great fun doing that.
</p>

                        <p><title>Saturday at Marcel&rsquo;s</title></p>

<p class=date>Saturday 11 April 1998 (day before Easter)</p>
<p>
Today I went to Marcel's parents' house to chill for the day.
Mostly Marcel and I hung out the whole time, playing frisbee or shopping or inside with the family and Kayse and Adrien, plus Mimi's friend Caroline (?) who was in from Morocco.
<p>
'cel and I went to purchase a video tape and stopped to look at computer prices, just to see what's out there.
<p>
The current latest stuff at Computer City:
<table> <!-- to make the <hr> tag the right length -->
<tr><td>
<ul>
<li>266 Mhz Pentium II</li>
<li>6.4 Gig HD (didn't say SCSI or IDE)</li>
<li>64 Meg memory</li>
<li>24x CD Rom drive</li>
<li>56k internal modem</li>
<li>4 Megs memory on VGA card</li>
<li>sound card</li>
<hr>
<li>$1500 !!</li>
</ul>
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Oh, and ZIP drives (external, store 100megs on a disk) = $150 | Jaz (external 1 Gig) = $300 | Jaz (external 2 Gig) = $650
<p>
I looked because I'm in the market and I put it on my webpage for historical reference.  I was really impressed with what is available!
<p>
Anyway, we didn't find what we needed, so we drove toward Best Buy, but chose to drive through the parking lot instead of using the street and <em>bing</em> we got to the end of the lot and there was a railroad track between us and Best Buy!
<p>
Cool!  So we walked around on the tracks and spent several minutes analyzing how the electric current works around the switch. As total nerds, we had a great time, and you probably wouldn't understand.
<p>
After shopping, Marcel joked as we walked out of the brush back toward the car, "a cop sees us walking out of the bushes to the car, 'say, where'd you come from?'  'We parked here so we could walk across the tracks to go shopping!  Really!'"
<p>
<hr width=30%>
<p>
Back at his house we played frisbee outside for almost an hour, and I was amazed as the garbage truck went by picking up "garbage" for two reasons:
<ol>
<li>What people will throw away (lots of aluminum cans and glass, bucket of paint, branches and leaves, 4x4 lumber about 5 feet long)</li>
<li>The 4x4 was snapped almost like nothin' as the big scooper thing shoved the garbage toward its belly</li>
</ol>
<p>
Marcel's brother Andre joined us and we played a bit until it got too hot.
<p>
Then we dyed eggs once everyone got home from shopping and I recorded video of Marcel, Kayse and Adrien blowing bubbles and stuff.  Then I recorded Mimi and Caroline and Mimi was all, "you can put that away" (don't record me!) so I told her I wasn't recording but just playing with the different picture effects.
<p>
I could click from "mosaic" to "sun filter" to "something" to "stretch" to "thin" to "B & W" to "photo negative" and that was cool.  Oh, I was recording.
<p>
Had a great discussion with Marcel as I was leaving; we seem to do that- to start talkin' philosophical stuff when we are time constrained... I wonder why!
<p>
It was a great day with my friend.

<p class=date>Thursday 9 April 1998</p>
<p>
Wow!
<p>
I was just listening to 107.5 the BUZZ, my favorite evening radio station (would be in the morning, but I hate the new DJ) and my man John Leach was giving away Third Eye Blind concert tickets to the next person who could show him a driver's license with the numbers, 1,0,7 & 5 in the number.  My license does!!
<p>
So I drove drove drove the from work to where John was broadcasting, outside Bayou Place, the newest greatest theater complex in downtown Houston.  I got all excited as I was really close and he came on the air and did <b>not</b> mention a winner!
<p>
One more intersection to go and I parked up on the sidewalk at the corner and <b>ran</b> toward where the booth was and stepped over a couple waiting fans and under the cord roping off their area.  "John!"  <font size=-1>oops wrong guy</font> "John!" 
<p>
He recognized me and I was all, "hey I got my driver's license!" and they were like, woah and I realized that a dude had just gotten there before me and got them. Sigh...
<p>
I congratulated Fred (same as my brother's name!) and he was all, "I don't have them in my hand yet..." but soon John was handing them over, "are you gonna go to the concert?"  Fred was quite affirmative in response and got the tickets.
<p>
Then he was all, "but I might not be able to get a babysitter..." and he <b>gave me a ticket!</b>
<p>
Wow! Wow!
<p>
And what was actually even more rad for me was John recounted the story over the air just as I was arriving back home and was all, "and then 2 seconds later a guy named Rob comes up and Fred was all, 'you know I might not be able to get a babysitter' and gave him one of the tickets!  So they'll be goin' to the concert together and have a good time and a couple beers..."
<p>
I was pumped!
<p>
But wait, before I got home (yes my car was fine on the sidewalk), I remembered "d'oh!  I'm s'posed to meet Kathy at 8pm!"
<p>
Aw man...  So I called her up and left a cancellation type message.  I hated to do that, but I hope she'll understand when I tell the whole story.
<p>
So now I'm gonna get ready and go!

Tera Little and Lisa Rubens are the facilitators for the weekend, and that's cool because Tera is an advisor/DRE from my district and she's really great! We went as advisors to many rallies last year.
<p>
This night's work has really encouraged me to just go for it and create my life around youth work. Just give me room and board and access to the Web and I'll do it!
<p>
The most amazing thing I learned tonight was after we ended for the night. Christina Branum-Martin, one of my best friends from my YRUU days actually created what we now know as the Leadership Development Conference or LDC!!  Just several years ago, as a youth, she and Duane Dowell designed them! I feel so honored that Christina is my friend and I am actually kinda jealous/awe-inspired by her work!
<p>
<em>I</em> want to create something like that.
<p>
Oh... the SWD YRUU <a href=https://www.geocities.com/heartland/2735>website</a>.  Yeah, but an annual conference that is now used across the continent!
<p>
Sigh...
<p>
I am inspired. I really want to just quit my job and work doing what I love.

<p class=date>Thursday 2 April 1998</p>
<p>
This morning Maggie and I worked from 2:30am to like, well it's 8:12am and we're still here, but we should be able to leave pretty soon..
<p>
Each morning of the second of the month, we get to stay up and babysit the batch jobs.
<p>
About this process Maggie says, "<em>We don't get much sleep, but we get to leave way early.  And you can wear the same clothes two days in a row and nobody knows but Rob.</em>"
<p>
We're going to do some errands and then watch cartoons after we get to leave.

Today the new version of the New Invoice Service was approved.  This version allows the users to view and print not only invoices, but information obtained through an SQL query to an RDB (Standard Query Language query to a Relational DataBase).
<p>
This is rad because Mario (my supervisor's manager's manager) said this should be the last version we put online before I get to write something else to replace it.  We're lookin' at having me write an interface that can be viewed over the Web.

I washed my car today. I went to the local do-it-yerself place and spent $2.75 to have great fun with the bubbly pink bubbles and the high power splashy spray gun. I love doing that. I got pink bubble juice on my Biff's Wonderful Clamdip T-shirt.

Tonight the LRY is meeting at Chuck E. Cheese Magical Satanical Pizza Place! That's fun 'cause we get to climb all through the tubes and play in the ocean of plastic balls.</p>

                        <p><title>Chuck E. Cheese</title></p>

<p class=date>Wednesday 1 April 1998</p>
<p>
At Chuck E. Cheese's Magical Satanical Pizza Place, the goal for the night was to acquire enough tickets to trade in for a lava lamp, lofting large purple wax bubbles bathed in soft light behind the counter.
<p>
We included "Satanical" in the name because their phone number includes "666" but the recording we hear when we dial the number says something like, "Thank you for calling Chuck E. Cheese's Magical Pizza Place..."<br>
Okay, well, it's funny to <em>us</em>, so laugh!
<p>
Anyway, after eating pizza and mixing soft drinks to taste like Nerds, we hit the gameroom.  I had like $9 in tokens and spent them all on one machine that lets me use a little gun shaped remote-flipper to toss one coin at a time nearly randomly into a glass box with dinosaur heads and crevices and a spinning Wheel of Fortune looking thing at the bottom.  The crevices were labeled with different ticket amounts between 1 and 25 tickets.  The dinsaur heads were worth either 100 or 200 tickets, and the Wheel of Fortune had about 20 slots awarding between 1 and 25 tickets.
<p>
In just several minutes, I converted my 36 tokens into 273 tickets.
<p>
Sounds great until doing the math.  Each ticket is worth 1 penny at the counter, while the tokens were worth 36 tokens * 25 cents per token = 900 pennies.
<p>
But the story is a lot more interesting than, "I went to Chuck's and bought a 1 dollar flashlight for 9 bucks."
<p>
Gambling fever took kT most viciously at what we call the "Feed Me Tokens" game. It's the one where you toss tokens or quarters in there and little shovers shove the enormous stack to within one tenth of one millimeter of falling off the edge, but nothing falls.
<p>
About 8 tokens went into the machine and a few tokens fell and about 10 tickets came out. Then four quarters went in and one token fell and 10 more tickets were ours. Dennis set off the TILT alarm probably 10 times trying to help. 
<p>
Out of tokens, we went and weighed our loot of tickets.
<p>
Including the previous 2 nights kT and Dennis had gone, including around 300 tickets I donated, they had 1270 tickets.
<p>
$12.70 for maybe 80 or 100 bucks in tokens?  Good for Chuck!
<p>
So we (me, Laura, kT, Dennis) dove into the ball crawl and stormed through the tunnels and tossed balls at one another at buried ourselves and ambushed the others and generally had a great time.
<p>
kT found 4 tokens in the bottom of the ball crawl!
<p>
We converted them into like 10 tickets, gazing longingly at the precarious stacks in Feed Me Tokens.
