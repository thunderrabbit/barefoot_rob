<p>I am at KTRU now, but I'm not DJing, just listening to the baseball
game being broadcast.  I'll get $30 for only 4 hours of work.  (If I
call this work, of course)</p>

<p>So, um, oh I'm going to go through my email; I have 173 messages. 
That's not as bad as I thought, actually.  Okay, here goes.</p>

<p class=date>7:39pm</p>

<p>I've deleted about 8 messages probably.  Maybe less.  I've replied
to 1 I think.  Mostly I've been talking on the phone, looking for
someone to bring me some food.</p>

<p>Super incredible fantastic thanks to the lovely and talented</p>

<h1>M A G G I E</h1>

<p>for bringing me some chinese salad, driving all the way in from
where she lives.  Her wonderfulness is a brilliant star in my life. So
so thankful!!</p>

<p class=date>8:51pm</p>

<p>Owls trail 2-1 in the bottom of the 9th.</p>

<p>I have 119 email messages left.</p>

<p class=date>8:54pm</p>

<p>Game over; Rice lost.  115 messages.  Now I get to DJ as soon as
they are done with post game show.</p>

<p>I've been playing around on my new Mac a lot during my free time
yesterday and today.  (Today's free time came after I worked 11 hours at
Dennis's work, organizing their competitive literature.)</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, I'm still not internet connected; I couldn't get
Dude's linksys router to allow the firmware upgrade to make it 802.11b
instead of just 802.3..  OS X won't do 802.3, but OS 9 will.  Thanks to
Marcel for his research on this.</p>

<p>It did slurp up the pictures from my digital camera pretty easily, but
the image editor iPhoto is not completely easy for me to use.  I want to be
able to highlight multiple pics and delete them all at once, and I want to
be able to delete pics when I'm viewing them full size, and not just
thumbnail.</p>

<p>I spent quite some time exploring the linux side of things using emacs on
the terminal window.  I'll download an Aqua emacs as soon as I get OS X
online, and know what I'm doing.  I saw the real locations of several of the
folders, and I am curious as to how the Finder knows what folders to
display.  It doesn't display all of them, even though the permissions are
the same.  Curious.</p>

<p>I found a way to change the text under the buttons on Internet Explorer.
Now the buttons are:</p>

<p>back, jack
<br>mooove
<br>false
<br>refresh
<br>crib
<br>printify
<br>lazy
<br>e-mail</p>

<p>The lazy button is one that fills in forms for me. </p>

<p>Pretty fun stuff.  I'm going to bed.</p>

<p>Today my PowerMac was delivered via FedEx.  I've been playing around with
it and sorta getting it set up.  I mostly still don't know what I'm doing
with it, but I've got a general grasp of OS X.</p>

<p>I met with Kim Sawyer at Starbucks and was eager to try out their
wireless internet access.  It was trivial to set up as far as my Mac was
concerned - just clicked Continue on the AirPort Setup application.</p>

<p>However, the access is not free.  I would have to pay $29 per month for
access.  There are some bulk purchase options available, but I don't hang
out in Starbucks very often, so for now I'll just say no.</p>

<p>Ironically, I still haven't found how to start a command line shell, nor
emacs therefore, though the unix base is a huge reason of why I wanted OS
X.</p>

<p>Wow.  It's really time for me to be sleeping, but I'm fully awake after
hanging out with Philip Gayle, an improvisational musician whose concert I
attended tonight.  This is a guy who I first saw perform at KTRU some years
ago when my friend Alexis was interviewing him on the radio.  I was
listening and Philip rought up the longest word in the English language,
which, of course, he had (and still has) memorized.  I was intrigued enough
to go online, find the word, print it out, and come to the station to
deliver to Philip confirmation that he was correct. (I found out tonight
that he still has that printout filed away.)</p>

<p>He performed improv music on a mini guitar, a mandolin, and a guitar,
using rocks, sticks, picks, other stuff.  This was a duet with Jeff Gburek,
who played banjo with sticks and sandpaper and stuff.  Bizarre good mprov
stuff.</p>

<p>But the show after that was even better.  I didn't know that Philip
wasn't the headliner of this little event. </p>

<p>The main thing was Ephia and Jeff Gburek performing Butoh style dance,
which I had never heard of before.  Had no idea what to expect, but I was
amazed.  I found it bizarre, beautiful, intriguing, repulsive, spooky,
captivating, surprising, scary.  At the end of the show the entire 21 person
audience was transfixed.  No one could move; the tension was so thick.</p>

<p>I had the distinct pleasure of hanging out with Ephia, Jeff, Philip
tonight at Philip's girlfriend's house.  I don't remember her name.</p>

<p>Jeff cooked excellent spaghetti and vegetarian sauce.  We ate as Jeff and
Philip spouted tons of random thoughts and bullshit on musicians, alive and
dead.  The conversation was so funny, and would have been better I'm sure if
I had known more than 1/5th of the names they were mentioning.</p>

<p>This story is to be continued; tomorrow at 6pm is a Butoh workshop that I
will attend.</p>

<p>I'm going to invite Suzanne.</p>

<p>It's so completely awesome to just have a cell phone.  Just now I
got a call from a Fed Ex guy who was standing at the front gate of my
apartment complex.  He has part of my new computer!  (It's the 5 gig
external portable drive)  If I had a phone in my apartment, he would
have just gotten no answer, and possibly would have taken the package
back with him.</p>

<p>However, the front gate calls my cell phone when my apartment
number is dialed; I asked him to drop it off with the leasing office.
So excellent!</p>

<p>Oh my gosh Erika just came in and I'm all "HI!!!!!!!!" on the
inside and totally poker-face on the outside cause her mom is totally
right nearby anytime Erika happens to be near me.  I don't know if
it's intentional, but I'm not too surprised if it is because on a
different occassion, Karla wisked Erika off to lunch so that I
wouldn't be distracted.</p>

<p>Wow.  How incredibly amazing this evening has been.</p>

<p>Today at work I received an email from Chuck, inviting me to attend level
3 ASL class at Border's bookstore across from Whole Foods.  Excellent.</p>

<p>Ima (pronounced EE-ma) was getting a ride home from her twin sister (Eka
"EE-ka"), but her sister was a bit late so I hung out with Ima.  Some of
Ima's friends from her church happened by, so we talked to them a bit until
the mom was done shopping and we all left.</p>

<p>On the way out a familiar face saw me, and I immediately remembered her
name (Courtney), who I haven't seen in 7 years since our days at UH.  She's
married to Thunsten who was there, and who I barely remember from UH.   We
chatted a bit and then I left and called Maggie to tell her, etc.</p>

<p>Maggie didn't know Courtney, so I was all, "she's really nice, um, do you
remember that girl from Law who had long dark hair?  Um, maybe she lived in
Bates...." and Maggie was all, "Diana?"  "Yes!!"</p>

<p>I'm always amazed when Maggie can remember names so well.  I commented
how I was pleased that I remembered Courtney's name so quickly.</p>

<p>We talked more as I drove to Walgreen's to get shaving cream and a new
poof scrubby thing.  Then I visited Kroger to get soy milk and celery and
jelly.</p>

<p>As I walked toward the register, I realized the woman walking  in front
of me looked ridiculously like Diana.  I dropped back a few steps because I
had just about walked past her, and I wanted more time to gawk to see if it
was her before I approached her.</p>

<p>I got behind her and her guy friend in line and confirmed it was her.</p>

<p>"Oh my god.  Maggie, I have to interrupt you," and Diana turned around
because she was all <em>why is this guy saying</em> oh my god <em>about the
way we're scanning our groceries?</em> and she recognized me as I continued,
"remember how I was just talking about Diana a while ago?  She's right in
front of me in line."</p>

<p>I gave the phone to Diana and they were all "holy cow!" and stuff over
the phone, so after the guy finished scanning their groceries, I introduced
myself.  His name is Noah, and he said he though Diana had mentioned me
before.  (This is a perk of being the only barefoot guy on campus for 4
years)</p>

<p>Such a fantastically amazing synchronicity and I am so thankful for the
way my life unfolds beautifully before me like a lotus in bloom.</p>

<p>We got Diana's contact information and she said, "please be sure to email
me, hopefully this week."</p>

<p>No problem.</p>

<p>Diane and I will probably go visit Maggie at work some day soon.</p>

<p>I chatted with my neighbor Andrea tonight.  She had just made popcorn so
we munched on that, just chillin' on her couch.  Her roommate Alana was
there for the first little bit, but she left around 10:45 or so.</p>

<p>Andrea and I traded travel plans; she's going to Brazil, Argentina,
Chile, somewhere else early next year.  I updated her on my Japanese trip
plans (interview with Nova on 20 June)</p>

<p>We gossipped some about the apartment complex management, and how we
really liked that Suzanne remembered <em>all</em> of our names, whereas the
new managment does not.  Okay, yes, she was here for 10 or so years, and
they've been here a couple of months, but still, we miss Suzanne.</p>

<p>Conversation shifted to music when her CD player turned itself on at
11:30pm, as it apparently does every night.</p>

<p>I haven't really hung out with Andrea that much before.  One other time
sorta; fun stuff.  She's moving a few units down the way when Alana moves
out, so I'll have to walk an extra fifty feet to say HI soon.</p>

<p>Ellen has begun to move in.  As I was chillin' in my underwear on the
living room floor, I heard someone walking by and down the stairs.  I looked
up and she waved at me.</p>

<p><em>Ellen?</em> I wondered.  It had to be her.  Woohoo!</p>

<p>I tried to think of something smart to say as I put on my shorts to go
outside and presumably help her move stuff in.  I looked over the balcony as
she was using the broken cinder blocks to prop open the gate.  She succeeded
and I walked down the steps and into the parking lot before I said HI.</p>

<p>She jumped a bit and I felt bad a bit.  Doh.  I shoulda said something
sooner.</p>

<p>I helped her bring up a single load and then she left for Walgreens to
get toiletries.</p>

<p>I look forward to falling out of love with her so we can just be friends
and I can quit being so silly.</p>

<p>We've been playing Silent Football for about 4 hours now.</p>

<p>Grant is the dictator now after Kenny had been dictator after I had been
dictator.  We've used different names all three times, which seems to have
resulted in not remembering names, as Grant has been not referring to
everyone by name.</p>

<p>I also just forgot that Kenny was renamed from "Fro Daddy" to
"Frodo."</p>

<p class=date>4:53 am</p>

<p>I have just received negative 22 points: -10 for doing a funny monkey
imitation, -10 for a Beastie Boys quote: "Ya gotta get up to get down"
and -2 for "Like Fred Flintstone drivin' 'round with bald feet."</p>

<p>In my estimation, the funniest thing tonight was Matt's name.  It started
as Mr Matt.  And then when he declared that Fro Daddy was afflicted with
some laughing disease, he was renamed to Doctor Matt.  Then he said
something was apalling, or someone said he as apalling maybe and he became
Apalling Doctor Matt.  Then he suggested that his name be Sebastian Mas
Valentine, so I renamed him to Apalling Doctor Sebastian Mas Valentine.
Then his brother Grant somehow warranted becoming Brother Of Apalling Doctor
Sebastian Mas Valentine.  Then, of course, Matt became Brother Of Brother Of
Apalling Doctor Sebastian Mas Valentine.</p>

<p>Grant was subsequently renamed Funny Giraffe Noticer after he pointed out
the funny faced giraffe on a poster in the room.</p>

<p>Brother Of Brother Of Apalling Doctor Sebastian Mas Valentine was not
renamed.</p>
