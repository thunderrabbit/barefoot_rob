<p class=date>11:04am Saturday 27 October 2001</p>

<p>First workshop I attended was improv workshop.  Here is my 1/30th
part of improv story that we did:  (30 people were in the workshop)</p>

<p>The story was significantly more interesting than what my words suggest.</p>

<p class=date>11:41am</p>

<p>Just finished crawling through the jungle gym!  Great fun and bendy time!
Michael and I played a game that my brother and I played way back in
the day, "Sewer," which is basically Follow The Leader, crawling like
huge clumsy snakes in, through, around, etc the square holes of the
jungle gym.  Bryn got a few good pictures of it.  Actually I haven't
seen them yet, but they should be good.  Totally incredible fun!</p>

<p class=date>2pm ish</p>

<p>social action.  So pleased that I got to experience a snippet of
what it would be like to live in OKC and let Debu drive.  In the back
the whole time, Bryn and I placed flyers on houses with Amber and LSN.
Jeff and Debie sat in the front seats, driving and navigating.  Now I
just finished talking a nap and will go play ultimate with Sean, et
al</p>

<p>3:23 am-Instructions begin
<br>3:30 am-Phat Pat comes up with idea for 'silent football' instructional video.
<br>3:34 am-Rob aknowledges that perhaps people 'MIGHT'  make mistakes during play of 'silent football'
<br>3:47 am-Game starts
<br>3:50 am-The B (me, Ben) Said 'insert masculine name here, insert name for maculine genatalia, insert word for potato'
<br>3:55 am -Mr. Cole resides in 'unquotum town'????
<br>3:56am-Ppppttt is a cool name
<br>4:01 - Mr. Cole got .3 penence points for screaming 'CRAP!!!' very rudely
<br>4:07 - Baron Von Name Change said 'Mistress Rat....t'
<br>4:13 - Baron Von Name Change zooms the long way over Misturd's head, while Mr. Dictator takes the shortcut infront. I am baffeled as to what the Baron was doing.
<br>4:14 - Duchess Feline confuses the hell out of everybody and in the process says two pronouns.
<br>4:18 - The Baron: 'No pronouns.'
<br>4:19 - Mr. Cole has dug himself into a pretty damn deep hole and seems to have found a young dog there...twice.
<br>4:24 - Mr. Cole needs some *cough cough* to learn grammar.
<br>4:26 - Meara: 'Mr. Dick..........tator.'
<br>4:37 - The legendary Padre Donut en Mis Pantelones  joins the sacred universe.
<br>4:39 - Mr. Dictator fucking zoomed a fucked zoom
<br>4:44 - the shrudge and the scroogler
<br>4:56 - Baron zooms like a cannon, Misturd is afraid to be sitting nexto a cannon, but it's nothing like being on the recieving end of a cannon, like me, The B.
<br>5:02 - Baron 'fires' right in front of Mr Shit-if-I-know Turd face, scaring the 'shit' out of him
<br>5:08 - Misturd is forced to sing Little Bunny Foo Foo, I missed why, but he gives a very graphic version of it.
<br>Meara: Good job taking notes :)
<br>5:11 - Mr. Cole: '...Mr. Dictator never granted [Misturd] freedom of speech.' Mr. Dictator: 'Nor you.' Mr. Cole: 'I know...crap...'
<br>5:25 - Baron gets way too overzealous. His zoom looks more like an
<br>entire arch of the B's side of the circle
<br>5:34 - What the fuck just happened?? There's nothing much else I can say at this point.
<br>5:40 - Duchess Feline does a half version of Little Bunny Foo Foo for doing little half bunnies. It is qui- amu-.
<br>5:46 - Misturd and Padre Donut en Mis Pantalones recieves 3/4 points for excessive crotch grabbing.
<br>5:50 - Three way loss by Padre, Baron and Cole. They will do a three
headed monster version of Little Bunny Foo Foo. Duchess Feline is of
the opinion that 'her' rendition of little bunny foo foo was much more
amusing.
</p>

<p class=date>5:04 am CST 28-10-01</p>

<p>It's actually an hour earlier than what is recorded.  I will use this time to sleep.</p>

<p>Great game, though I didn't intend to award enough penance points to Padre Donut en Mis Pantalones for him to go over 5 penance points.  I paused, but realized it was too late.</p>

<p>I got to wear the all seeing hat of Mister The Bibbster cause he chose not to play, which surprised me.  Bryn also chose not to play, which also surprised me.</p>

<p>But it's all good; we had a great time!  :-)</p>

<p>Asphalt, when it's first poured, is hot.  I
recently had the fun experience of watching the guys
outside our window pour asphalt to make a street. 
Actually, it's just a layer of asphalt, on top of
which will be poured concrete, fourteen inches
thick.</p>

<p>A worker guy said it's 360 degrees when poured. 
Asphalt.  Not concrete.</p>

<p>Even more amazing though - the steamroller (which
doesn't run on steam) can vibrate.  Not just like the
engine is vibrating, but the actual wheels(?) are
being vibrated up and down to further pack the
concrete.  I mean asphalt.  Wow!  Each wheel on this
(small) steamroller weighs 4 tons.  Their big roller
is 7 tons per wheel.</p>

<p>After it was steamrolled, the steamroller driver
was giving me answers to the Asphalt FAQ, and said
that I could stand on it if I wanted, "but it will be
hot."</p>

<p>I stepped onto it with both feet.  It was hot. 
Probably hotter than I've ever stepped on a hot
parking lot before, but I didn't stay standing on it
too long.  Or that was my intention.  When I stepped
back off the surface, some of the rocks stayed stuck
to my feet.  They were still hot.  But not so bad.  I
scraped them off into the dirt.</p>

<p>Had to scrape them off again before I tracked tar
inside.</p>

<p>Fabulous great fun riding bicycles with about 10
other cyclists tonight.  Reminds me a lot of my Wild
Skating Adventures, but a longer ride, and a lot
faster, too.</p>

<p>Got a late start from University Schwinn in the
Rice Village area - almost 8pm before we left. 
Apparently they ride a consistent route each time. 
This allows people to ride a significantly different
speeds, get caught at traffic lights, or tie a shoe,
and still know where to meet.</p>

<p>From Rice Village down Hazard to Shepherd and
Memorial intersection.  Waited for everyone to catch
up.  Down the trails along the bayou into downtown,
and waited again while underneath Prairie and Bagby
street near Bayou Place.</p>

<p>Along the trail, up to the street, down the big
circle trail, up the 180 degree hairpin turns, over
to...... some bar on Texas street or so.  I dunno.  I
got water; most of them got some variety of alcohol,
except, I presume, the 16 year old riding with us.</p>

<p>Then.. off to Mission Burrito, and flying hauling
ass as safely as possible while not stopping at stop
signs.  We used 4 way stops as much as possible,
recognizing that the cars would most likely stop. 
Because we did not.  But no worries; no cars to
concern us anyway.</p>

<p>I got a Que Mas Salad; ate half of it and chilled
with everyone outside.  I got it in a to-go box, with
the intention of taking the rest home for lunch
tomorrow.  I did this, and sorta cramped my fingers
trying to hold the bag and my handlebar at the same
time.  Couldn't always just let my arms drop; the
sidewalks are too broken and hilly at the
intersections.</p>

<p>Made it home, and discovered the plastic container
holding the salad had ripped a hole in the paper bag
and was about to leap for safety to the ground.  It
would have been Que Mess Salad.  I'm glad I didn't
lose my lunch.</p>

<p>I've felt fairly distant and distracted today.  I
know those aren't emotions <em>per se</em>, but I'm
not really in touch with those.  Probably sadness.</p>

<p>Vaguely working on email stuff for my project. 
Basically productive, but only a few hours worth
today.  </p>

<p>I'm leaving now.</p>

<p>I rode my bike to work, which means I'll be riding
my bike to I-group tonight.  It's going to be a bit of
a hike, but I don't think it will be too much problem.
 Especially considering I was going to ride to
Maggie's house a couple months ago.</p>

<p>I rode my bike around the Police Officers' Memorial
on Memorial Drive this morning.  I had either never
been, or it had been so long that I forgot most of its
structure, but now as I write, I think I've been there
in a deja vu sort of way.</p>

<p>YRUU meeting itself was succinct.  We figured out
who needed to do what for the next few events and then
split up for a few hour before SNOW (Sunday Night Of
Worship).</p>

<p>Bunch of us munched at Subway, the one where Ryan
sang a song for a sandwich, though the employees there
today were not as impressed with the story as Ryan.  I
sat at the glasses table, with Mattboy, Daniel S, and
me, until Markie Mark stole back his glasses from Matt
and joined our table.  Matt found some more glasses in
his bag, and became an Emo Gangster.</p>

<p>Ryan, Amy, Kirk (sp) sat at the other table. 
Mostly Ryan and Matt made gangster threats to each
other.</p>

<p>Frisbee at Northshore Park afterward.  Fun stuff
with Unnecessary Jumps and silly fun.  We were joined
by two players who had been tossing a disc with their
friends, until their friends abandoned them, and we
invited them to join our group.  Ryan and Kirk worked
on their songs for SNOW, while Amy helped by
listening.</p>

<p>SNOW was better this month than last, if only
because it was the second completely successful
worship event the group has created in a row.  The
community built a Dr Seuss style structure out of
blocks, while offering commentary on community
building.  The music was quite good, and ended with
Three Chartreuse Buzzards to end the evening with
happy faces.</p>

<p>Super cool was laUURYn and Kate showed up for the
worship, all the way from Austin.  :-)</p>

<p>On the way home, I left a voicemail with the
message that I wanted to relay to kT, not including
Happy Birthday on the 16th:  I played a song called
"nope" last night on KTRU, and thought of you and the
roadsign game.</p>

<p class=date>2:10pm</p>

<p>Wende says she's jealous of the apartment I found.  Jennifer says
Wende is just too picky when looking for her own apartment.  She has
been using the old fashioned method of driving around to look.  I just
surfed the web.</p>

<p>After checking out my apartment, we munched at Mission
Burritos.</p>

<p>Jennifer and Bob (our next door neighbors)'s friend Mario came to
look at our house twice today.  I'm glad that he likes it.</p>

subject: KTRU Social * ! TONIGHT ! *

HI All

I am in the station with Jessi, KTRU Social
Coordinator, and I was all, "Hey, we should all go to
a Haunted House tonight!!"

We're meeting at the station at 10pm and then
caravaning over to Phobia on 59 near Kirby.  According
to their phone message (713-526-DEAD), they are open
from 8pm until business is dead.  

$12 for 1 haunted house, $20 for 2 haunted houses (per
person).

If you've got nothing better to do tonight than be
scared outta your wits, come join us!

     - Rob!
</pre>

<p>If you don't know where the station is, just meet
at Phobia.  Call the number above if you don't know
where Phobia is.  We're going to the location on
Kirby, not way out 290. Or call me at the station
713-348-5878.  (713-FIT-KTRU)</p>

<p>Fun at ultimate.  We won 11 to 4 or 5 I think.  The coolest thing
was <em>after</em> the game, when Dave taught us a new throw!  It's a
forehand thrown behind the back.  It's actually pretty easy once you
know how to throw a forehand.  Just got to get the butt out of the
way.  The coolest thing about this new throw is that before it's
thrown, it <em>looks</em> like a forehand, but then *zing* the disc
goes behind the thrower's back.  Wow!</p>

<p>After the game, we played a 4 on 4 scrimmage to hold the field
(which we had reserved) until the next teams showed up.  That's when
we learned the new throw.  We were fending off a big group of soccer
players who wanted the field.  Of the next two teams, only one showed
up, so they won and the soccer players got the field and everyone had
a happy day.</p>

<p>The only person to show up for the KTRU haunted
house outing was a graduate student named Fred, who's
getting a PhD in physics at Rice now.  I had ridden my
bike to the station, so we took his car to <a
href="https://www.darke.com">Phobia</a>, which boasted
a somewhat long line and two haunted houses at the
Kirby location.  (3 years ago they just had 1 haunted
house there)</p>

<p>We paid our 20 bucks and talked a lot of physics
and computer science stuff while waiting in line.  In
the haunted houses, I was mostly in the lead, and went
through loudly clapping and yelling, and sometimes
mocking the commercial:</p>

<p>Hello?</p>

<p>What's up with you?</p>

<p>Chillin', walkin' through a haunted house.</p>

<p><b><font
size=+2>WHAAZZZAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHPPPPPP!!!!</font></b></p>

<p>I was only scared a couple of times by the actors. 
One stepped silently in front of me, about a foot
taller than I am.  One guy (maybe two different guys)
made themselves look all slumped like a doll against
the wall, and then would jump up as I went by.  Good
stuff.</p>

<p>On our way out of the first haunted house, Fred was
in the lead, and I was right behind him, and the girl
behind me was pushing me to go out faster.  Funny.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Zipped over to House of Pies and when I walked into
the restroom to wash my hands, I fully expected
someone to jump out at me.  No one did.</p>

<p>Fred and I talked more random stuff; he likes
movies and has seen several.  He doesn't like French
Nouveau films.  I don't blame him, I'm sure.</p>

<p>He dropped me back off at KTRU and I rode my bike
home without incident.</p>
