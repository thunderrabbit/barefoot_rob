<p>Server upgrade seemed to go well, but I was surprised to find it only
upgrade to 14.04.4 instead of 16.04.</p>

<p>oic:</p>

<pre><code>While an upgrade from 14.04 may successfully complete, upgrades
between LTS releases are not enabled by default until the first
point release, and it is recommended to wait until the 16.04.1
point release to upgrade.

about urbit until A arrived and we talked about her semi-precious gem
necklace and other stuff, including urbit.</p>

<p>My computer&rsquo;s kernel_task was hogging the CPU at 700% usage so I
emailed Lantz and he was able to take a look at it today.  Turns out
it was just dirty, including having something stuck in the fan keeping
it from running properly.</p>

<p>Well!  I can hardly blame Apple for that, but I&rsquo;m glad I was able to
get it fixed (plus receive a five point driver that can drive the
Pentalobe screws) without paying them.</p>

<p>So, now that my machine is working again, I will be able to be
productive tomorrow / tonight / right now.  Lantz suggested I give the
machine a good cleaning about once a year; hopefully this machine will
keep working for a long time.  We&rsquo;ll see!</p>

<hr />

<p>Further prep included going to a sewing shop to get some thick thread
and needles to fix my bag.  I&rsquo;m bummed that my attempt to buy a Burton
bag resulted in Goldilock&rsquo;s Syndrome, but I&rsquo;m not going to buy a new
bag that&rsquo;s not optimal for my needs.</p>

<p>I walked for 1.5 hours today, 25 minutes to the station, and then a
lot of walking to look for the TUMI shop and then walked to work&hellip;
almost walked to work; Lin called me back and offered to meet me at
our station to hand off a folder I forgot to bring with me today (not
critical, but for men&rsquo;s group meeting tonight, so I&rsquo;d prefer to have
it).</p>

<p>So I walked to Ebisu and took the Saiyo Line to Shinjuku,</p>

<h2 id="11-30">11:30</h2>

<p>whereupon I found the Odakyu Line was completely stopped due to a
suicide.</p>

<p>Thanks guy!  You saved me some time!</p>

<p>Headed back to work where I&rsquo;ve just arrived at 11:49.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m tired now.  Want to sleep super much but other people are here bah.</p>

<p>Yay!  Mitsue came to the second half of the TESOL course taught by Rob
Waring.  We both found it to be quite useful.  Went for non-alcoholic
drinks at convenie afterward and I griped about the state of Apple as
I see it.</p>

<p>No gripes about seeing Mitsue!</p>

<p>So today was the big day! Got to assist Soness at TEDx Waseda as she
assisted all the speakers in the event. I helped Alan by recording
some audience reactions during the presentations.  I couldn&rsquo;t do many
because the camera couldn&rsquo;t discern much of the audience in the dark.
He recorded all the presenters and some audience reactions after the
show.</p>

<p>All the presentations were great!  Well, the ones in Japanese were
hard (near impossible) for me to understand, but the rest were great!
Yuji&rsquo;s was amazing for his first time up on stage.  I&rsquo;d love to give a
presentation that well!</p>

<p>Great to meet Rick (who flew in from LA to speak) and Mitsue, both of
whom I knew from Soness&rsquo;s
<a href="https://soness.teachable.com/courses/ted-worthy-application/">TED Worth Application</a>
course.</p>

<p>Great to see すん, and got to meet his friend はるき as well!  They
both came up from Yokohama, having been invited by Soness.  They&rsquo;re
taking her class on communication skills.  Met
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/bannerline">Steve Marshall</a> after the
show and told him about Tokyo men&rsquo;s group.</p>

<p>Outside, Steve and Mitsue took pictures of Yuji, me, and my bare feet
for Pecha Kucha, and I got caught by the &ldquo;one&rdquo; security guard roaming
the campus on Saturday when I climbed up on a wall overlooking a
staircase.  Aww man it wasn&rsquo;t event at the deep part of the stairs!</p>

<p>We took a bus then subway to Shibuya (we = me, Soness, Yuji, Mitsue,
and Rick) where we ate 回転寿司 (かいてんすし) after visiting
Hachiko.  I chatted with Mitsue during dinner, talking about how I met
Lin and how she met her husband, and the history of flower arrangement
in Japan.  Turns out she is 9 (nine) days older than me.  Wow!!!</p>

<p>She also teaches English in Japan, so I invited her to the TESOL thing
tomorrow; we&rsquo;ll see if she comes!</p>

<p>Okay I just got to my station. bye!</p>
