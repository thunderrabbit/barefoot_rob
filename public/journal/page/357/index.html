<p>Woke up without an alarm.  Easily on time for anything.  Nice.
Easy livin' in Japan.</p>

<p>Hmm.  I wonder if Rie will get my message via email and call me.  I
wonder if I can look up her grandparents in Kikuna.  I'll talk to Koko
about that.  I wonder if Rie's Houston peeps have her number here.  No
time like right now.  Wake up.  Call them.  Find out.</p>

<p>Left an apologetic message.  So sorry to bother you again this is
Rob in Japan and the last time I gave you my wrong phone number um if
you have rie's number in Japan, please (fuck this message is going all
wrong) um, call her or call me um, my number is zero eight zero three
two zero nine zero six seven eight I can't believe I'm asking you to
call Japan I'm so sorry.  Thank you, .. bye.</p>

<p>doh.  Sit.  Pout.  Release.  Get over it.  Nothing to be done.</p>

<p>Shower as long as I want. Scrubby scrubby.  Wash wash.  Shavey
Mcshave.  Rinse-o dry-o done.</p>

<p>Bedroom.  Get dressed.  I wonder if I can buy short sleeve shirts
here.  I think I saw Steve wearing one.  If he can wear one, I can
wear one.</p>

<p>Got everything:  tie, wallet, keys, calendar, phone, dictionary,
clock, jacket.  (computer and backpack are a given)</p>

<p>Outside.  Nice day.  Cool air.  No rain.</p>

<p>Ride bike. Low traffic on Sunday.  There's a man standing ankle
deep in mud near the river.  His sandals are to one side of the mud
puddle.  Got a picture.</p>

<p>Got my favorite spot in bike parking.</p>

<p>Wait a bit for train.  Don't fight for a seat.  Stand.  Patience.
Tadasana.  Next station.  Wait for train.  Stand.  Patience.
Tadasana.</p>

<p>This is boring.  I think the only reason I sound excited about
being in Japan is cause of the *idea* of Japan.  This shit is fucking
boring!  I fucking hate Japan.  No one reacts to anything; emotions
are all kept in check.   This is what Chez was talking about - all
these motherfuckers are just automatons, expressionless cyborgs with
no apparent meaning in life.   Wtf is going on here, and *why*??</p>

<p>What am I not getting here?  Is this what Benny unconsciously
fights with his humor?  Am I embracing the culture?  Can I go home
now?  Will you all wake up?  What's a guy gotta do to get some
attention over here?</p>

<p>Okay, yeah I know that, but what about some positive attention?</p>

<p>And why are all these people smoking?????</p>

<p>My phone rang a couple times during work.  Well, it vibrated, and I
of course may not answer it during class.  And there was no number on
the caller ID so I don't know who called.  I'm hope hope hoping it was
Rie, and that she got my message.  But if it is her, I'm surprised
that there was no number since I assume she's in Japan.</p>

<p>I'm going to hit the internet cafe soon and see if she sent me an
email.  I'd really like to get in touch with her.</p>

<p>It'd be doubly cool if I can see her tonight and have both of us go
to Kimberly's house for dinner and Japanese yammering.</p>

<p>I'm on the train going home now; the weekend business (I mean
busy-ness) at work is over.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Turns out it was Kimberly calling to say she and her husband got
food poisoning and therefore chose not to entertain tonight.  I'm
like, "oh of course; take care of yourself" etc, and she was like,
"are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Yeah; what am I gonna do, come over anyway?"</p>

<p>The quote of the day at work:</p>

<pre>
The castle has an elevator in it.

It's a funny castle.
</pre>

<p>I found out today that Guy does pushups between classes if he has
time.  Like he'll knock out 50 pushups in a couple minutes.  He has
daily goals of like 400 pushups.  Nice.</p>

<p>I also learned from some level 3 students that the rainy season
doesn't begin until June, with June 8th being the average start date.
(Today)</p>

<p>According to the weather forecast, the rainy season will start on
Wednesday.  According to the students, the big storm we had a couple
weeks ago was a quite rare occurance.</p>

<p>I told them that I thought typhoons and hurricanes were no big
deal.. or rather that they were exciting and not scary.  Cause we've
got <em>tornadoes</em> (and one of the students finished the word with
me)........  I gave them the scary details of tornadoes (plus some
vocab): chaotic, 300 mph winds, small, how they can disappate then
regenerate, cause houses to explode (so we open windows to protect
against that), etc.  Two of the students seemed intrigued, and one
wasn't all that talkative; I wonder if he'll tattle on me for a non
Nova lesson.</p>

<p>Ah well; it was good stuff.</p>

<p>Today work was pretty much okay - the schedule could have been more
packed.  Just before the third lesson a new schedule was put up, so I
had approximately 3 minutes to plan a lesson for 4 people.  Not gonna
happen; I hadn't even pulled their files of course so I didn't know
what lessons they had done recently, etc.  So I just faked a lesson,
not referring to the book much, thereby ensuring they hadn't just done
the lesson I was doing cause it hadn't previously existed.  Rock.</p>

<p>Later, I went to the voice room, sat down all like, "yo" and then
Carla came in.</p>

<p>"D'oh!"</p>

<p>I was <em>supposed</em> to be doing a lesson; I had gotten my times
mixed up.  So that was another lesson I faked.  Not like I don't fake
most of my lessons, of course.</p>

<p>It went rather well even so.</p>

<p><em>Then</em> I went to the voice room; Carla was all, "you got
voice now, bud" to me in a mock helpful manner.</p>

<p>Oh, speaking of mocking, Benny, who could be considered "cool," is
actually just mean to people.  It's the way he interacts, and the
whole deal seems to be the same thing as in high school.  The popular
kids are flat mean to others.  And it's not like he physically hurts
anyone, but just verbally fucking with people, and cut-downs and such.
What's the deal with that?  Why do people put up with it?  Should I
intervene more than, "hey man, that's mean" ?</p>

<p>It's just weird.</p>

<p>The quote of the day from work:</p>

<pre>
I have had snake soup three times.

The snake tasted like chicken.
</pre>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>After work, I zipped over to the rather large bookstore in search
of an English text for Fumi.  I found two of rather different styles,
and I hope she likes at least one of them.  At the same time, I hope
she doesn't just pretend to like one of them.  I'll continue looking.
(maybe)</p>

<p>As a non-trained English teacher, I don't know what to really look
for in a book.  Part of the question stems from the wide range of
learning patterns of different people.  I have heard from Steve that
no one really knows *how* people best learn languages.</p>

<p>My stop is next.  (I've been writing on the train (nambu line
Kawasaki to Musashi-Kosugi))</p>

<p class=date>8:07pm</p>

<p>Home now.  Just ate something fishy, and by that I mean it was
seafood.  But it wasn't a fish with scales.  It had skin like a
catfish, but seemed to just be a headless cone shaped thing with two
flaps (fins (tail)) near the point of the cone.</p>

<p>It tasted like.... the sauce it was in.  The meat was a bit chewy,
but not like oysters.  It seemed to be cooked, but I couldn't tell how
it had been heated.  The texture was a cross between pressed chicken
and fish.</p>

<p>And it had been cut crosswise halfway through the cone about every
1.5 cm down the cone.  I don't know what that was about, except maybe
to prove that it had been cooked, or maybe just a stylized
presentation.  Hard to tell.</p>

<p>I feel so weird right now.  Partially homesick, partially just want
to be hugged, partially light headed, partially tired, partially
hungry.  Actually I think I'm a lot hungry, but nothing sounds good.
I'm drinking hot green tea, but it's reheated tea from two days ago I
think, cause I used all the remaining green tea</p>

<p>ooo; I suddenly had a need-to-throwup feeling as I thought about
two day old tea, or as I looked over at the next cup I poured for
myself.  I'm going to down it and see what happens.</p>

<p>Last night before bed I tried crying, but it didn't go very
far.</p>

<p>Last night before sleeping, I took a dose of night time cold
medicine, which usually knocks me out cold.  I didn't take it as a
sleeping pill (though I took it at night knowing that I could be
sleepy with no problem), but in hopes of solving the dry throat
feeling with which I have woken up the past couple of days.</p>

<p>Last night sleeping I had a dream including</p>

<p class=dream>my arrival at a house that we'd left for two days and
finding a young boy in the house, sitting with perfect posture on a
chair, patiently waiting for someone to come home.</p>

<p class=dream>I projected that he needed a hug and offered that to
him.  He was like, "yes" and I hugged him and kneaded his arms and
legs and back.  I complimented him on such patience and told him I was
further impressed by his good posture.</p>

<p class=dream>I was reminded by a friend whose son he was (that of a
yoga teacher or something) and I was like, "oh" as if that explained
why he had good posture.</p>

<p>As I write this dream now, I see that kid as myself (except for the
yoga-mom), alone in this big house-country (as opposed to alone in a
country house), patiently waiting for my term to be up.  Or waiting
for someone named janette to come rescue me.</p>

<p>For some reason I'm not comfortable asking my local peers for
hugs.  Comes down to a fear of looking like a big sissy.   No - it
comes down to a fear of</p>

<p>of what?</p>

<p>something about not trusting these people around me.  Not to the
depth of trust that I trust my men's group back home.</p>

<p>Frank is in AA recovery, and apparently has been for years.  I
might reach out to him.  He's such a fucking hard ass on the surface.
That New Jersey outer coating he's developed, I assume.</p>

<p>(He happens to be in New Jersey now, officially helping with his
cousin's overdose.)</p>

<p>Frank attends AA meetings here; I wonder if there is a warrior
group here.  I wonder if I can start one.  Where do I start for that?
I know; I'll write to my men's group back home and tell them what's
the deal on my end.</p>

<p>It's 10:51am; I'm going to begin slowly getting ready for work.</p>

<p>It's 11:06am; I just wrote to my men's group.   *Now* I'm going to
get ready for work.</p>

Men

I fucking miss the fuck out of you guys.  I literally have not been
hugged in the 9 weeks I've been here.  I have felt too much fear (?) /
distrust to ask for hugs of anyone around me in Japan.  Fear that they
will see me as a big wuss, or that they will misunderstand and think I
want more than just a hug.  (Which of course, part of me does, but I'm
choosing not to listen to my dick)

To take care of myself, I will search online for any Warrior type
things here in Japan.  My hope is that I can find some initiated men
in the Tokyo area, and shit, maybe that I can find an I-group.  Maybe
I can start one.

If my current mood persists, I will write an article of some variety
for the DRUM.  Right now I have to (choose to) get ready for work; I'm
beginning my work week (I have Tuesday and Wednesday off) on Thursday.

Thank you for your blessing / grounding at my most recent I-group
night a million years ago.

If you know of warrior resources in Tokyo, please let me know.

With Love and Blessings

ps: despite my emotions, I am making headway in Japan; I've got a
stable job which will allow me to pay off my debt (from 11,000 miles
of road tripping around the US) and have found three private English
students who I'll teach (separately) each week.  With that tutoring,
I'll make enough money to cover my daily expenses.  Awesome.

<p>ps: I finished the second cup of tea with no dramatic increase nor
decrease of a need to hurl.</p>

<br>i love your dream! as soon as i started reading it , i thought it must be you-the good posture gave it away. isn't that so cool and probably enough to make psychologists wet their pants to see you comfort your child-self like that?  i think it is a good sign of your understanding and ability to love and express it physically in a healthy, beautiful way.<br>
  i really like your letter to your men's group.  so forthright, so rob. "i'm choosing not to listen to my dick." <br>
 yeah! i will rescue you from huggus absentia.<br>
 do you think our stories help placate your need for physical attention?  they help me.  but i am not forgetting that my situation is different.<br>
  i wish i could be there for you when you are sad or want to cry.  i wish i could rub your arms and back and tell you what a good boy you are.

<p>As I walked outside to my bike I noticed that I hadn't looked over
my list of things to make sure I have when I left.  Checked my pockets
and everything seemed fine.  Didn't go back to check.</p>

<p>Got to the bike place, carefully found the closest spot on Aisle C
and lifted my bike over other bikes to put it there.  Somehow kept the
tires from hitting my white shirt.</p>

<p>As I left the bike place I somehow noticed that I wasn't wearing a
tie.</p>

<p>Forgot my fucking <em>tie</em>.</p>

<p>Back back back home put on a tie and didn't even make sure it was
the optimal length.  The tail sticks out about 1 cm past the head(?)
what is the big part of a tie called??</p>

<p>Carefully stuffed another tie in my bag to leave at work so I can
forget it again and just put one on at work.</p>

<p>Paying 150 yen to get to ÇﬁÇ≥ÇµÇ±Ç∑Ç¨ (3 stations away) so I can
add $ to my train pass.  Can't do it at Å¬Ç»ÇµÅ‹.</p>

<p>Saw Kimberly talking to some western cat in the train station.
Waved to her, but didn't stop to chat.</p>

<p>I felt urpie pretty much all day at work today.  Like that slightly
light headed feeling when I'm just about vomit, but not <em>quite</em>
yet.  A couple times (four times?) during the day while talking, I
just had to, like, stutter, a bit, to keep my urps from upchucking on
the table, and then the sensation would turn into a cough and I'd
cough into the crook of my elbow.</p>

<p>urp.</p>

<p>A student of mine said, "I saw your homepage." and I'm like really?
and lo, though I was so careful to not tell many people, I wrote it on
my self description card - like meet the teachers and all our pictures
are up on the wall with likes and dislikes below them.  At the bottom
of mine says www.robnugen.com.  Whoah.</p>

<p>Her name was Ç¶Å›, I think.</p>

<p>I leveled up a student named ÅﬂÇÆÅ›.  She had had a level up slip
in her folder for about a week and for some reason, no one had given
it to her.  So we reconstructed two levelups for her today.</p>

<p>But I still felt upchuckie.  Was able to eat rice and basically
good food (no chocolate gorging today), but still unsettled.</p>

<p>Fred told some stories at OKC rally talent show.  I didn't remember
two of them, so he reminded me.</p>

<pre>
We made our first contract on the way to Canada while waiting at the
service station for the rabbit to get fixed.  (I don't think I ever
knew what was wrong.)  I kept getting upset that you were calling me
names, so we agreed that if one of us called the other a name, the
punishment was getting hit.  Seemed fair, the contract was solid, and
we signed.  The ink wasn't even dry before you started taunting me.
It took about twenty seconds for me to call you a name.  Within three
minutes, you'd hit me three or four times, I had shredded the
contract, and proceeded to pummel you.  Ah, the difference four years
can make.  

The rowboat thing goes like so: for some reason, about four or five of
us were standing on the dock looking at a rowboat.  I got in, probably
at the collective agreement that rowboats were cool.  I never intended
to go anywhere--I was just sitting in it.  Someone (I think it was
you) untied the boat, which proceeded to float away.  I started to get
scared, and yelled for you to go get Mom so she could rescue me.  As I
was floating slowly away (I was 20 or 30 feet from the dock), you told
me how to row myself back in.  "Face backwards," you said.  Just use
the oars.  Face backwards, I thought.  That's fucked up.  That's just
about fucked up enough to be right.  I mean, you just can't make up
that kind of shit.  Even if it isn't, I can just turn around to fix
it.  And if I'm crooked, I can just flail about with one oar to get
pointed the right way again.  That dock's not that far away.  I can do
this, I thought.  I took a deep breath.  "MMOOOOOOOOOM!"
</pre>

<p>I don't remember the first one at all.  I kinda remember the
rowboat thing.</p>
