<p>The live md5 count thing has been languishing for a while, so I bribed
peeps on bittippers to see if anyone would be interested.  One guy
added one string to the list, and then another guy and I added strings
from 127 to 140 in a little less than two hours. Nice!</p>

<p>He said it was an interesting puzzle for him because he&rsquo;s into cryptography.
Perfect!</p>

<p>Funny: he also wrote a little cheater in Perl to search for strings.
His included just a counter inside a string, so I added a counter to
my md5 count cheater as well.  It makes for really short strings!</p>

<p>Using my new verb 手伝う, I asked Shibata if there was anything I
could do to help around the store.  She was like, &ldquo;really?&rdquo; and I go
yeah! and ended up helping her make an image of a ship using stackable
soft-plastic building blocks.</p>

<p>Shibata said she is leaving the toy store soon. Boooo.  She&rsquo;s gonna
work somewhere in Tachikawa, so soon it&rsquo;ll be さよなら time.</p>

<p>Tonight I set up a repo for a site I&rsquo;m supposed to temporarily replace
with a full page banner ad on Monday.  I think I&rsquo;ll call the site BS
or maybe BSJ.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s running in csh not bash, so my preferred git log replacement
looks like ass.</p>

<p>We watched <em>Starting Over</em> at Jon and Paola&rsquo;s.  It&rsquo;s a comedy romance,
but pretty good, though JP were like &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not going to win any
Oscars..&rdquo; I liked the student; he reminded me of Ferris Bueller,
though I barely remember that movie.</p>

<p>Markdown allows me to write without having to worry about paragraph
tags and other markup.  I&rsquo;ve got loads of experience writing HTML4
markup so it&rsquo;s a welcome reprieve. HowEVer, I&rsquo;d like the option of
using specific CSS on certain paragraphs, specifically for when I
write my dreams.  My convention is to have green italics for dreams,
green without italics for lucid dreams (iirc from my old school
journal).</p>

<p>I tried putting a big &lt;div class=&lsquo;dream&rsquo;&gt; around everything, and
that works for the green italics, but the separate paragraphs are
being squished into one big paragraph.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve got Middleman using Redcarpet for markdown.  I dunno if it can be
easily tweaked at that level, or even maybe write some custom fencing
so I can write</p>

<pre><code>``` dream
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>``` lucid
</code></pre>

<p>and have Redcarpet deal with them that way.</p>

<p>OR if I hafta do something so shocking as put paragraph tags around
each paragraph!</p>

<p>Not sure how many times I have said this.</p>

<p>For no apparent reason, I can&rsquo;t select the specific set of icons I
want to use for my app.</p>

<p>So I told it &ldquo;no icons&rdquo; and then told it &ldquo;use icons&rdquo; and selected the
set I created.  Click &ldquo;migrate&rdquo; (the only option) and it creates a new
<em>empty</em> set of icons next to those which I already created.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s bad enough.  I say &ldquo;use this&rdquo; and it creates a new empty set
instead of using what I want.</p>

<p>But now I can&rsquo;t even find a way to copy the icons from one to the
other without starting the fuck over from fucking Finder, and don&rsquo;t
get me started on fucking slow as fuck Finder.</p>

what about having a new suit tailor made before ach gae and destroy it during the game, like a new ten tohousand dollar suit

so I was at a tailor getting my suit done and I said, hey these seems aren't perfect and he started to redo them, redoing hours of work, and I asked
and he told me his name, and I asked hi

and she showed me teh romanji spelling and I was like no screw Englihs, show me your name in your native language.  and the letters looked like curvy cyrillic letters and he showed me how to spell his name.  I was so happy that I held his face and kissed him; thank you for teaching me your name, and he was like, O_o surprised but much happier to speak with me after that  We talked about his family and I was like, "take me to

let 's go to your house tomorrow..  Oh, I mean your home country, and he goes, "i need some time to get my affairs ready, and I jokingly said "no I don't care about your personal life, I want to meet your family hahahahahah  no just kidding it's a joke about not respecting your personal life so I can pay respects to your personal life" but the joke dind't go across very well     we saw the story of how I became wealthy through a misunderstanding as I was on a fake private jet and there was an anounement onboard that my then wife/girlfriend was lie,, "wot?" and divorced me so I made a shiton of money in the deal.

and the tailor was iike "what you weren't rich when you were born?" and I go no I guess not

my friend tried to rip open a seam like the tailor had done Wikam was hs name but it was proncouned Kiham which is why I wanted to see it in his langueage   but my friend fucked up he seam by ripping the actual fabric so tit would all have to be done again.

With Mutsumi at  an interesting shop with lots of machine tools including some acidic powedre which was apparently used to "seal" rabtis and dogs fand cats feet in a process called "protection" so tere was a campaign using green and ellow log "against protection" and I was so moved by reading the story ,w chich was printed across the labels of several products haning in his shop, including some with just one word per labels like one word of the story was written on the package of the product

I was like where can I get the "against protection" stickers?  and he said, Utah so I  planned to have Fred get some because he worked for BNCE, and then I realized oh BMCE but close enough certainly he can get stickers   Then Mutsumi was walking home with me on some railroad tracks and said Lin had made fish for her and her mom, but that I woud only get fried rice. because of my diet.  We were twalking in fired rice on the train tracks so it made sense.
