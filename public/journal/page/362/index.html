<p>Today has been awesome.</p>

<p>Notable:</p>

<p>(~) I worked overtime at KQ.</p>

<p>(!) I had a total of 9 students today.</p>

<p>(@) I had a total of 3 (out of 8) lessons free (0 students)</p>

<p>(#) Something shook the whole building, but it wasn't an
earthquake; it was the construction next door digging a hole or
something.  Really weird.</p>

<p>($) I got candy, a compass, a book and a card from TinaP!</p>

<p>(%) I talked to janette who gave me all the latest news and gossip</p>

<p>(^) She also told me that someone has requested my info on
findateacher.net!  (I'll check tomorrow to see if they wrote to me)</p>

<p>(&) It rained mostly all day today.</p>

<p>(*) Good night.</p>

journal.pl?date=yyyy/mm/dd.  So for example, today
www.robnugen.com/journal redirects twice, all the way to
www.robnugen.com/cgi-local/journal.pl?date=2003/05/19.</p>

<p>Lemme know if probs.</p>

<p>Called Jackie this morning to confirm she got the NIN I sent her.
She had.  Rock.</p>

<p>Been half-lumpy half-studying this morning.  Flashcards rule.  They
help me bypass the word circus in my head my visual-vocal ability
seems more efficient than visual-language1-language2-vocal.</p>

<p>I now know 
<br>cat = ÅÀÇ±
<br>snake = Å÷Ç—
<br>mountain = Å‚Å‹
<br>ÅÕÇ≥Å› = scissors
<br>ÇŸÇÒ = book
<br>Ç‡Ç‡ = peach
<br>dog = Ç¢Ç 
<br>Ç©Ç≥ = umbrella
<br>Å‰Ç´ = snow
<br>Å§Å‹ = horse
<br>ant = Å†ÇË
</p>

<p>To obtain the list above, I went through the flashcards and first
wrote the first word that appeared, and then its translation.  Nice.</p>

<p>I'm running off to the internet cafe in a bit after I shower and
such.</p>

<p>I officially ended my probation today.  It's a good thing.  Not
surprising, but still it feels good.</p>

<p>On the train, before we left the station, I got a call.  It was
Steve from work "Can you work overtime tomorrow?"</p>

<p>I said yes because he said it was at KQ (easy), but I had forgotten
that Dru invited me to go hiking with him and a couple others. I
didn't tell Dru yes, but d'oh.  that would have been fun.</p>

<p>I'm home now after munching with Andrew et. al. at TGI Friday's in
Shibuya.  Met Allie, an Aussie from Maribara (? (3 hours north of
Brisbane)) and Holly, a person from earth, and some other cats, some
of whom I had previously met.</p>

<p>I enjoyed chatting with Allie; she seemed eager to embrace the
Japanese experience.  She's been here for 1 week and will attend her
orientation tomorrow.  I was like, "OJT sucks a lot" and Andrew and
Holly were all sorta mockingly, "oh Nova's not that bad; it's great"
and I'm like "no really it sucked, but persevere; it will get
better."</p>

<p>We traded Nova stories, including mine today when a woman asked me
about slang and asked about "gonna" and "cuppa coffee" and "fuck
you."</p>

<p>I told her clearly that "fuck you" probably should *not* be used in
any context, but that "fuck" has some applications in itself in very
informal speech.  But for now, she probably ought not use it.</p>

<p>Allie likes _Pulp Fiction_, which gives her good marks, but she
doesn't like most of the popular films that I like.  Why are these
thoughts even in my head if I'm focused on janette?</p>

<p>In college I heard "it doesn't matter where you get your appetite,
just so long as you only eat at home."</p>

<p>I can't say that I've gotten any kind of appetite that's more than
passing, but the vehicle seems to be veering toward that side of the
road at times.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>What was really bad, and I haven't mentioned this to anyone but
you, so don't say anything was when I was teaching a kid at KQ; she
was about 5 and she went to hug me and I was like freaked cause a hug
is one thing that I want more than most things and I just felt this
overwhelming longing for the biggest hug ever and I was just like
mentally shredded as I slammed on the emergency brakes and threw the
transmission into reverse and paddled backwards like Ralph and at the
same time was all, "oh jeez please hug me," but she didn't; she was
actually reaching for a marker or something and I was like oh shit
that was nutty with a capital nut.</p>

<br>oh baby.  i wish i were there to hug you.  i could use a big hug from you, too.   i think that somehow this is a big, important growth lesson for you or it would not be so hard and you would not be going through some pain. <br>
  i feel so helpless when i read about these cute girls in your path.  i&rsquo;d like to blow then all away. i&rsquo;d like to not take it personally. <br>
 all i can do is carry on here, be the best i can be, stay clear,just imagine being with you and trust you are living your truth, still clear when i come in september.<br>
  everything we have been through together,(the seperations,resultant correspondence,the growth we attained by working through hard stuff, the fun, the adventures, the sex, the long talks,laughing over goofy shit, even tears); everything we love about each other,(spiriutal, positive world views, our sense of humor, eminem, our connection to young people, our energy, our accomplishments, love of outdoors and walks and biking and sex); the way we believe in each other and inspire each other to be the best; these things are enough to keep us connected until we see each other again.<br>
  i see this 6 months as a great experiment .  i&rsquo;ve never done anything like this.  i&rsquo;ve never been seperated for so long from someone i love so much. i&rsquo;ve never enjoyed sex as much as i have with you.  i&rsquo;ve never been with someone so strong in body and good intention.  i&rsquo;ve never had  heaven and then watched it walk away. it feels like a test sometimes.  like, if i work hard on being a success in my own right, if i learn how to love rightly, even from afar, i will earn the privilege of being with you again. <br>
 i know, i know.  what i earn is my own self-respect.  but i want your respect, too.  and i want to be with you again. i want to know you know i am worth waiting for.<br>
  hold on.  don&rsquo;t give in.  you can do anything you set your mind to.</p>

<p>I am learning lots about myself while living alone in this big
foreign city.</p>

<p>One thing I haven't learned about myself is that Eminem's music is
being loudy featured on two corners near Shibuya station.  This is a
pretty packed bustling city for a Sunday evening.  One spot was
apparently selling Eminem concert tickets and CDs and shit.  Their
booth sat outside a CD store and loudly played something; I forget
what.  Another was just a video of the song Lose Yourself being
blasted over the bustling din of the crowded intersection below.</p>

<p>What I have learned is that I'm intimidated to talk to people cause
maybe cause I think they are too busy to talk to me, or I get scared
about the language barrier.  And then with all this Eminem shit going
on I'm like damn he made it and he's younger than me.  How did he make
it?  Why am I using Em as a role model? Fame. Apparent fame and riches
and wonderful lifestyle which I know he doesn't have as completely as
my brain maybe portrays.</p>

<p>I can sit and people-watch like this group of no they're boring.
This girl wearing a booty bag of an outer space theme or dammmmm this
cat with a huge fucking fro wig on.  That's hilarious.    Or these
micro short skirts and spikey high heels (oh he just took his wig off
and now it's on his friend's head)....</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Thanks to Eminem's lyrical encouragement in "Lose Yourself," I
asked some guys where I could find an internet cafe.  That was the
success in itself.  Not finding it, not using it.   Well finding it,
yes, but mostly just asking them.  Getting over that silly fear in my
head.  Silly fear.</p>

<p>I got to the cafe, but I couldn't use my computer there.  They did
have one cool thing; wait service at the individual cubicles.  Far as
I could tell, a customer simply picks up a handset at his cubicle, and
the front desk answers and takes their drink/food order.  Awesome.</p>

an island. I was floating out in the water at the time and the ship
accelerated for a while and then decelerated the same amount for the
second half of its journey.  I swam over to its path and found the
water was quite shallow, like only a couple of feet deep and I didn't
understand how such a large boat could have been floating in such
shallow water.</p>

<p class=dream>Then I was floating in the wake of a large man walking
the same path as the boat had taken.  He was a pretty funny guy,
making jokes or something along the way.  Jokes and sound effects.</p>

<p>I bought flashcards on the way home from work today.  Actually it
was right near my work so I went back to show the girls who staff our
office.  They were appropriately appreciative.  Their encouragement
helps me study; I can flirt with them by speaking snippets of
Japanese.  Very harmless snippets like "horse" and "I am eating
rice."</p>

<p>Guess what</p>

<p>I'm in Japan!</p>

<p>It just seemed to hit me, as I'm actually kinda sorta feeling
comfortable with most parts of my weekly routine.  I know what
triggered it; I got paid.  Or as Dude and I would put it, I got
paaaaiiiaaiiiiiaiiiid!</p>

<p>126,000 yen for a month and that's the lowest it should be.  Frank
thinks they took out too much rent and after two months I can add
40,000 yen that they won't be taking out for the advance, and I'll be
off probation etc etc.</p>

<p>So this smallest paycheck is $1260, all of which I can send home
because I've withdrawn enough to last the month until next paycheck.</p>

<p>It costs 2000 yen to send money home, and that seems to be the best
price around; I haven't done the research myself, but everyone I talk
to says yeah that's it.</p>

<p>BUT(!!) my bank reimburses up to $6? dollars per month for ATM fees
if I withdraw money from a different bank's ATM.   <em>Therefore</em>,
I believe I can call 'em up and flirt 6 dollars out of them for
the.....  uh oh I just thought of a problem.  I mean an opportunity
for more flirting:</p>

<p>If the 2000 yen is removed before my bank even sees the money, then
I have no proof of the fee.  But my bank can call Lloyd's and be all
yo yo what's the dealio and...  yeah.  It will be good.</p>

<p>I'm writing while riding the train (Nambu line from Musashi-Kosugi
to Kawasaki) and except for the train itself, it's silent.  Every seat
on the train is full, but no one is talking.  About 1/2 are sleeping
and about 1/4 are looking straight ahead with no apparent reaction to
anything they see, and about 1/8th are reading magazines, and about
1/16th are playing on their phones, 1/32 are listening to music, and 1
is typing on his computer.</p>

<p>My point: as I type while we're stopped at a station, each keypress
is the loudest thing occurring at the time.  Ooh now there are some
more people on and a few are talking.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Most train stations have music that plays just before the train
leaves the station.  This music certainly could be used to discern
from what station a train is preparing to leave, but by the time it
wakes a body up to get off the train, it's too late.  Maybe.  I dunno;
I'm still not sure why they play music.</p>

<p>But I do know that my favorite music is what they play when I get
off the train at Musashi Kosugi on the way home.  It's like a gentle
symphony compared to the hyper chords played at other stations.</p>

<p>We're at Kawasaki; gotta go.  Actually I don't quite yet, cause
there's going to be a mile long line (mob) going up the escalator. </p>

<p>Funny I can feel the train vibrate as people get off.</p>

<p>Great day at work today.</p>

<p>Great 1: working at KQ.  (turns out that is short for Keiku,
pronounced "KQ")</p>

<p>Great 2: talking to a guy who was all, "I want to live in Italy."
I was all, "dude; if you want to live in Italy, then live in Italy,"
etc etc and gave him even the first steps: 1) google.com: Teach
Japanese Italy   2) write to the addresses that come up.   OR 1)
google.com: Japanese Consul Italy  2) write to the addresses that come
up.</p>

<p>Easy, of course.  But I could tell this cat was like, "oh shit" in
his mind cause he was scared.  I was all, "I was scared before I came
to Japan." and to test his English I was all, "what did I type in
google.com?"  yes Teach English Japan.</p>

<p>Such a great blast to kindle someone's dreams!</p>
