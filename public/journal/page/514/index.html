<p>Oh!  yesterday I purchased some acrylic paints and brushes to begin
my canvas painting career.  Karla had donated some old (20 year old)
canvas and the woman at Texas Art Supply dispensed plenty of advice to
get me started effectively.  Only $30 for paints (8 colors, 2.5 ounces
each) and brushes (5 different sizes and a mixing thing) and a thingy
on which to mix.  (what's that called?)</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the process - lovely colors and lots of fun mixing
and blending and shading.  There's lots of cool stuff still to be
done.  When I finish it, I'll put an image of it online.</p>

<p>Yippeee!!!  I just got my linux box back up and working here at
work!  The most awesome thing about that is that I can whip out a new
journal entry in a fraction of the time it would take me otherwise.
Premiumly awesome.</p>

<p>It was a bit of a trick for me to remember what files to change to
get the IP routing tables correct, but bit by bit over a couple day
period, I got it all to work.  :-)  Hooray!!</p>

<p>It's quiet here at work today.  2 people are out, leaving 6.
Tomorrow we will have only 4 people here at all.  I plan to come in
<em>briefly</em> on Thursday and Friday to send out emails to some of
our clients.  Ultimately this will make it easier for me in the long
run than trying to run on Monday what was "supposed" to have run on
Thursday and Friday.</p>

<p>hee hee!</p>

<p>I just found a website of Cameron, who has recently
finished bicycling across the continent or so.  This
is on her site, and I think it's pretty funny:</p>

<p class=message>Now one thing i am NOT doing in
preparation for my trip is taking long bike treks. 
This seems to be the biggest question lately "have
you been getting in shape?"  Well, nooo. ... I'm going
to be biking 30 to 90 miles a day, just about every
day, for the next three months.  If that doesn't get
me in shape, a few trips around the Valley won't make
the difference.</p>

<p>Oh, the site is <a

                        <p class=date>11:07am Sunday 18 November 2001</p>

<p>Tammy's birthday.</p>

<p>I basically just woke up after having been awake
until 5:30-ish watching the meteor shower with YRUU
peeps Kate, Meg, Hethre, Phat Pat, Matt, Danny.</p>

<p>It all started back Saturday when I called Kate/Meg
to see if any YRUUers wanted to watch the meteor
shower that night.  The basic plan was they were going
into town to watch Elizabeth Elmore perform, and would
call me around 2am on my cell phone when they were
done.</p>

<p>"Cool," I said.  "I think I've heard of Elizabeth
Elmore."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Jump to 6:10pm Saturday as I arrive at KTRU for my
shift.  In this case, I was not going for my shift,
but actually to fade in and out the basketball game
announcer as the Lady Owls Take On The (somethings) In
Corpus Christi.  The announcer guy was supposed to
call the station at 6:15 to say they had connected
successfully to the connection thing that allows us to
broadcast them over the air.  That's why I had to be
there so early, in case there were problems with them
connecting.</p>

<p>Jessi was not there; I expected this because I saw
her request for a sub on the email list.  I met her
sub, Audrey, a first semester DJ whose shift is 1-4am
on Friday mornings.  Blah blah blah meet Audrey and
trade a couple DJ stories and whatever and she pointed
out 3 microphones that were set up in the studio. 
"Someone was supposed to be here at 6pm to play."  It
was about 6:25 when people with sound equipment and
such walked in.  First thing I said was, "Just to
inform you, we are scheduled to broadcast a basketball
game at 7pm, so you have 35 minutes to set up and
play."</p>

<p>In the back of my mind I noticed the basketball
announcer guy had not called.</p>

<p>To Audrey, "HI, I'm Elizabeth," said the woman who
had walked in.</p>

<p>"Oh, Elizabeth Elmore!" exclaimed Audrey.</p>

<p><em>Elizabeth Elmore</em>, eh?  Whoah!  She's um,
wait, oh my gosh how randomly ironically wonderful
cool is this????</p>

<p>I'm super thankful to Justin who knew WTF he was
doing and helped her set up all her sound stuff, as I
just kinda stood around wondering when the basketball
guy would call.  I was getting a bit nervous about
timing.</p>

<p>I called Meg/Kate.  "Guess where I am?" Before they
could answer, "Guess who is here?"  Before they could
answer, "I'm at KTRU and Elizabeth Elmore is here
about to play!"</p>

<p>After confirming that they were going to listen, I
assured Elizabeth, "You have at least one listener,
who is going to your show tonight."</p>

<p>So Meg/Kate turned on the radio and got to listen
to 15 minutes of Elizabeth Elmore interviewed by
Justin as I *finally* got a phone call from Derrick,
the basketball announcer, "HI; we've been trying to
connect for about 45 minutes, but are having trouble."
 Oh <em>great</em>.  And by great I mean not
great.</p>

<p>I was quite... quandried.  On one hand we've got an
artist performing live, and the Derrick *should* have
called a long time ago, especially since they were
having problems.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the artist had also arrived
late, and the basketball game was scheduled to begin
at 7, and I was being paid to help make that
happen.</p>

<p>On another hand, we are trying to create at least
the semblance of something that sounds good and
promotes the KTRU sponsored show, and all that.</p>

<p>In the middle of the basketball chaos, after
Elizabeth and Justin wrapped up the interview, after I
made neck cutting motions at Justin in the most
respectful understanding way I could, I asked
Elizabeth if she would write a note to Meg and Kate. 
She was happy to do so.  The cool thing is that I
found a flyer advertising her show on which she wrote
it.  The odd thing is that the show advertised was for
last week, not this week.  Hmm.</p>

<p>In the middle of wrapping up Elizabeth's last song,
Justin confirmed that the basketball game was
connected, using the tiny cue speaker quietly enough
to not be picked up by the mics that were listening to
Elizabeth.  "Tell them they are connected.  I could
hear something in the speaker," he indicated to
me.</p>

<p>Relief.  All is good.</p>

<p>So when her show was wrapped up, we turned them up,
but the line sounded like crap.  It actually sounded
like an alien space transmission that I might hear in
Star Wars or something.</p>

<p>I had forgotten to get the phone number of Derrick
so I could call him to tell him to reconnect.</p>

<p>Doh!!</p>

<p>Called Will, called Mike, got them connected, and
super thanks to Ben for being there to help with that.
 As I got them connected, Ben was on the phone with
Derrick on a different line.  "Okay, you are live;
you're connected," confirmed Ben.</p>

<p>But then for about 45 seconds or a minute, we
broadcast Derrick going, "hello....     hellooo..."
with basketball game sounds in the background.  Justin
tried using the 'talkback' button to tell them,
"You're on the air."  Actually there are two buttons.
"You're on the air, you're on the air, you're on the
air, you're on the air."  Obviously he couldn't hear
us.  "Hello....     hellooo."</p>

<p>We still hadn't gotten their phone number in this
case to tell him he was on the air.</p>

<p>Finally Derrick called back, and Ben was all,
"you're on the air, all we hear is basketball game
sounds."  Then occurred the second weird experience
that we went from broadcasting cheery static to
Derrick suddenly calling the plays as if in mid
sentence.  Our listeners might as well have been
flipping through the radio dial to get the same
effect.  Very odd good KTRU stuff.</p>

<p>Big sigh of relief, big thanks to Justin and Ben
for their support.  Now I got to kick back for 45
minutes and write a letter to Joana, telling her the
story I just relayed above.  In the middle of my
letter, I noticed I had misspelled her first name on
the greeting.  Doh!  So, I played a song by an artist
who has the same last name as Joana, which you can
find on my <a
href="https://noise.rice.edu:81/sheet.nsf/15aa60c8727df106802568e90056b4d1/5e90e706ef2db4e486256b08000bd32b?OpenDocument">set
list</a> (I think the link will work).</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Jump to the end of my shift and HI/bye to the next
DJs Alex and Wendy, and Wendy's sister Marika (sp) and
Wendy's mom's homemade oatmeal spice cookies, which
were excellent.</p>

<p>Walked to Elizabeth Elmore show and got in free as
a KTRU DJ.  Found Meg, said HI.  Saw a girl who waved
HI at me, who I took a moment to recognize as Melanie
from my first ASL class.  The music was caustic (band
before EE, The Liars, I think), so I talked to Ben,
DL, Mondro, et. al. outside.  Mondro is currently
jobless and will be going to Australia for 4 months at
the beginning of 2002.  Nice.</p>

<p>After Elizabeth's set, I prodded Meg to go meet her
and Elizabeth was all, "oh, Meg!" cause she had
written the note to her.  All good, it was.</p>

<p>Drove Hethre back to Meg and Kate's house in the
woodlands, talked to Kate (who got stuff done instead
of go to the show) and waited for Meg to finally get
home.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>We raided the winter clothes closet; I fit quite
well in Kevin's pants and jacket.  Grabbed a pile of
blankets and drove to Southshore Park to watch the
Leonids.</p>

<p>So funny as we laughed at ourselves for being all,
"it's sooo cold, when it was probably only 60
degrees," Kate said. (I think it was in the mid 50's
but whatever) "while Northerners are in shorts and
going, oh it's so hot!"</p>

<p>We planted ourselves in the middle of the sidewalk.
 No one else was in the park but some ducks over by
the rocks.  Suddenly, the ducks got up.  Hethre was
all, "Um, those are people, not ducks." 
HAHAHAHAHahaahahah so so funny!  Meg, Hethre, and I
all collapsed into a fit of laughter in fetal position
at the same time.   Equally hilarious!</p>

<p>Lots of giggles, watching the stars; other people
arrived; some said HI.  The drunk guy and his
girlfriend, without the aid of blankets and winter
coats left pretty quickly.  "Don't throw up on my
shoelace!"</p>

<p>I counted about 45 meteors before I started falling
asleep.  Meg and Hethre were asleep before I counted
20.   Woke up in a fit of, "oh no I'm missing the
show!"  I must say that it was the most meteors
<em>I</em> have ever seen at a time.  As many as 20 in
one minute, and actually 3 in 3 seconds.</p>

<p>The peak seemed to be around 5am</p>

<p>Oh!  Matt, Phat Pat, Danny arrived around 4am. 
They had their own adventure looking for us and
finally seeing Kate's car on the side of the road.</p>

<p>A tad after 5am, we decided to leave.  We were the
only ones in the park.  Not even any ducks.  "We
won!!"  "Yes!!"</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Back to Kate and Meg's.  Sleep sleep sleep.</p>

<p>It's 12:13pm; I'm going to eat and then go to
YRUU.</p>

<p>I just saw an email that reminded me that I don't
remember who I picked for my secret santa person for
our Investment Club.  Doh!</p>

<p>Spent only 6 hours at work today and then I ran off
to paint Wende's plate at Paint This!  It's about 1/2
finished at least.</p>

<p>Now I'm going to ride my bike over to Dude's and
watch TechTV while munching pizza and ice cream.  Aww
yeah.  My kinda party!</p>

<p>Only 3 men at I-group tonight, including me.  We
brainstormed some guidelines that we'd like the group
to agree on and follow.  The goal is to make the group
stronger and better at doing what it's designed to
do.</p>

<p>I expect we will make great things happen for the

<p>So much stuff to tell!</p>

<p>This past weekend on Saturday was the final
tournament for ultimate.  Fluff won all three games
that we played.  We are completely undefeated for the
entire season!  A big source of our undefeat was our
numbers of players that showed up.  We had 15 people
while most teams had 8 or 10 players.</p>

<p>After ultimate, Eric and John helped me move.  Dude
was supposed to, but he forgot until I called him.  He
and his friend Carl helped move my junk from the cars
to the apartment once it was all carted over.</p>

<p>Then Dude, Carl and I cruised to Mission Burrito,
where we talked about Star Wars for 45 minutes,
including 20 minutes of predictions about what Episode
II will be like, given the trailer that I saw before
Monsters, Inc.</p>

<p>After talking for 45 minutes, I was all, "why don't
we go rent it?"  So we rented Episode I and watched it
through (in slo mo for the parts with cool action,
super loud for the parts with cool music), then
watched the deleted scenes, then watched the making
of.  2+ am by the time I got home.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Sunday was HAC YAC meeting with the youth.  Made
good progress on plans for Houston Rally.  I hope we
have registration forms available by Ft Worth Rally. 
(Hey, has anyone seen form <em>for</em> Ft Worth
Rally?</p>

<p>Painted Wende's plate at Paint This! and then
sleep, or something I guess.</p>

<p>I'm moving my computer tonight.  My linux machine.  My windows
machine has been off for several days.  I don't know what I'll do with
it.  I intend to connect my linux box at work, so I can have linux
close by, including telnet, ftp, emacs functionality.</p>

<p>Tonight Wende and I have been balancing the books for investment
club.  Also tonight Rick from my apartments expressed interest in the
club.  Wow; cool!</p>

<p>My sleep schedule got wacked out in the past 24 hours.  After
ultimate last night, I went back to work at work for a couple hours
and then I fell asleep on the couch at work at 12.5 am.  Woke up at
5.5 am and worked some more.  Lunch with Jodi from ASL to practice
ASL, and then left work early to nap and then go paint Wende's plate
at Paint This!</p>

<p>Met Nicole and Lisa at our apartment's Resident Appreciation Party;
they're a couple living across the complex from me.</p>

<p>HI to Rick on my way out to meet Wende, Molly, Will, Anna at our
house to munch La Jaliscience and then chill as I looked up
information on Leaning Tower of Pisa.</p>
