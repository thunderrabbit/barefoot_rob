<p>Driving home to Dallas now.  Apparently will drive straight
through; I haven't seemed tired so far and only 105 miles remain.</p>

<p class=date>6:08pm</p>

<p>Feels so great to be home.  Rolling around town with Janette and
Jack, helping Jack (helping by riding around in the car while Janette
drove) deliver some newspapers (anti-war papers?).  Got to help
Janette seal another squirrel hole near the gutter by the computer
window.  The mom squirrel moved her babies elsewhere; they're no
longer in the area that we messed with earlier.</p>

<p>Josephine is home from school + working on English paper.  She's
feeling a bit sick.</p>

<p>Was going to skate downtown Houston, but I slept too late to do
that before skating with Catherine at Memorial Park.  Great skating
with her and getting to chat for what might be the last time in a
while.  I keep saying fond farewells to my friends in Houston.
Sadness about leaving.  Excitement about going.</p>

<p>I already finished the three peanut butter cookies she gave me out
of her car.  "I don't really like them, but they're good" she assured
me.  Funny.  "Oh, and take these too," as she gave me more cookies.</p>

<p>I'm going to go say HI to Jennifer briefly at PT! and then go skate
downtown.  I have to do it for me.</p>

<p class=date>11:50am</p>

<p>Spent some time chatting with Andrea at Greenbriar and with
Jennifer at Paint This!  Andrea wasn't able to make it to my 12,000th
day party because a friend of her miscarried at 7 months.  Andrea
stayed with her at the hospital.  She told me her friend is taking it
quite well, trusting that her baby is in a better place and that this
is what's best, etc.  Andrea and I talked a little bit of world
politics; how cool is that??  And she told me she is beginning to
apply at PhD programs for political science type stuff I presume.
Awesome!!</p>

<p>Jennifer is feeling a bit sick today and will basically just load
the kiln and then roll out.  She told me Spot is getting fitter and
trimmer by running around outside, and can sit for 10 hours without
moving.  What a great cat!</p>

<p>Now I'm going downtown to skate.</p>

<p class=date>12:09pm</p>

<p>Oh wait; I'm going to stop by Perfect Vision first to get my
glasses adjusted and say HI.</p>

<p>Just skated some around downtown; my last skate there for a while
maybe.  Parked Scott on Allen Parkway then rolled into the city,
inches from an SUV type as he crossed in front of me merging onto
Allen Parkway proper.</p>

<p>Skated past the back side of Bayou Place, then rolled around the
new improved Jones Plaza under the watchful eye of some security
guards chillin' at a table.  OH!  But there were some cats playing
<em>chess</em> on a big chess board built into the sidewalk with
pieces about 3 feet tall.  So cool!  I wonder if I would need to make
a brain shift to play on a bigger board, which would necessarily
change my visual perspective of the game.</p>

<p>New building being built with a round face 1/2 block wide across
from Jones Hall and Houston Chronicle building.  Marble facing and
lots of windows.  I couldn't tell what it will be but it seemed more
like office space than lofts.</p>

<p>Down past Spy, the club where Kristen and Catherine and Katharine
would sometimes hang out until it was closed down recently.  D'oh!
Then was about to bust across the street jayskating style when I saw a
cop and put the quick brakes on and lept to the middle of the
intersection, crossing the street the direction I was allowed to
skate.  Then snuck across the middle of the intersection when I had
the green light.  It's a weird intersection between Spy and
Spaghetting Warehouse, facing toward UH Downtown.</p>

<p>Down to UHD, then up the steps then through the school to get a
drink and then down Main Street which was actually blocked off for
construction purposes as they are still working on the rail line to go
past there.  Oh that reminds me I didn't skate toward south downtown
to see the new rail lines being put in.  I've seen 'em before
though.</p>

<p>The parking lot in which we used to skate looks like it's being
converted to a parking garage.  Definitely good news for jurors; it's
the one right next to the courthouse where parking is a pain in the
ass when being summoned for duty.</p>

<p>Oh shit I gotta go.</p>

<p>Aight fast: um, I saw the NEW AQUARIUM!  And the coolest thing was
seeing Mary visualizing a new sidewalk between um,.. oh the Wortham
Center across to the Aquarium, designed to get pedestrians across the
bayou, more easily connecting Bayou Palace, Wortham Center, & the
Aquarium.  So when I see that sidewalk built after a couple years from
now, I'll know I was there at its inception.. before anyone even knew
where the sidewalk would begin or (depending on which way one walks)
where the sidewalk ends.</p>

<p>Gotta go see Rie now.</p>

<p>Visited Rie at her work, where it's pretty unbusy.  She had 1
customer in the hour or so that I was there.  She taught me some more
Japanese, well she showed me some more, and then even more when we
went over to Whole Foods to chat.  She showed me the equivalent of
blessings before and after dinner, and the honoring thing to say when
entering someone's home.</p>

<p>Hugs to Rie when it was time for her to go.  I wonder when I'll see
her again.</p>

<p>Went to Borders to join Chuck for an ASL class.  Fun to see him
again and see his new ear thing that allows him to hear now.  He said
he could distinguish the sounds of the guy pouring smoothies and
people walking and papers rustling...  Excellent.  He told us a funny
story about a refrigerator magnet sticking to the magnet on his head
that makes the hearing thing possible.  It took three neighbors
looking at him strangely before he knew what they were seeing.  Funny
stuff.  But not funny to one of the women (Michelle?) there who had a similar
device.  I didn't guess her to be deaf; she speaks without an
accent.</p>

<p>Got a URL from... d'oh I forgot her name..  Sarah I'm pretty sure
about these cats who had quite an adventure in Japan trying to get the
hookup on housing.</p>

<p>Walked out with Chuck, said bye to him and "see you
... whenever."</p>

<p class=graffitti>Super special thanks to Maggie for helping me
remember details of the 12000th day party.  Her memory is so
excellent.  Her typing skills are not.  She's so brilliant.  If
there's one problem she's always had it's been with comma,
splices.</p>

<p>I'm going home tomorrow!</p>

<p>I tried to stay awake for more of Maggie's stories, but I really
couldn't all the way.  I got most of them I think.  Now it's shower

<p>Just attended a folk concert featuring Charlie someone and Karen
Branbow or something.  Karen had an awesome a capella in Spanish where
each stanza was sung at one higher note; I forgot to ask her if she
went up 1/2 steps or full steps like I would really know what that
meant if I had the answer.</p>

<p>The anti war songs were real heartstring tuggers, like the one
where the singer had to go to war and did it so his kid wouldn't have
to fight and he ended up killing in hand to hand battle a 17 year old
or so and then had to quit because that kid was someone else's kid.
Lemme tell ya the song was way more poetic.</p>

<p>And then the one about our government's fucked up patriot act by
which they are imprisoning people without cause, except it was based
on the internet image of Bert (of Bert and Ernie) standing with Osama
bin Laden, so they sang about the government shutting down PBS and
arresting any friends of Bert, starting with Ernie.</p>

<p>And the song about the other thing that I really liked but can't
remember what it is.  Ah well.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I got to meet Gabrielle (sp), Eric (sp), and Bruce (probably not
sp), who were homies through concerts that Bruce hosts at his
apartment.  They met Theresa that way and she invited them here to
this concert that she set up.  They seemed like cool cats, though I
didn't get to talk to them much.</p>

<p>I signed some with Kristin, who can speak well though she is
apparently hearing impaired.  I gave her Chuck's email address and my
email address.  Oh, and when I stumbled through signing that I was
going to Japan to teach English, she immediately grabbed her parents
to have me tell them because her mom is interested in doing the same,
I think, though the dad was doing most of the talking about it.</p>

<p>They had an adventure in Russia a couple years ago, which is cool
cause Russia might be where I go after Japan.</p>

<p class=dream>Driving by a big field with a large flat rock and a
bunch of guys sitting on the rock, all wearing construction outfits, i
turned around and walked up all barefoot to say HI and figure out why
a bunch of guys wer sitting on this large flat rock.</p>

<p class=dream>I got a bit good naturedly harassed for no soes and
ignored it, "Well it doesn't take shoes to sit on a big rock.  What
are you guys doing?</p>

<p class=dream>And it turned out they were all painting like
transcribing from canvas paintings, they wre painting onto newspaper
that had been layed across the rock, and the idea was they would place
colored tiles on the rock to fit the image.  There was a painting with
a little bit of landscape and a small tree and some red sky for a
sunset image and the red paint was still wet.  I acidentally touched
it and then touced the whit ground under the horizon line, placing a
red dot on the canvas, not on the newspaper.  Since the newspaper had
already been painted, it did not include the dot.  I told them, "I
fucked something p, I put a red dot on the canvas here, but it's
already been painted to the newspaper."  "Oh, don't worry about it; if
the touch up person comes back through and puts a red dot there it's
okay.  I like it better with the red dot."  "I'm gonna come back by
again in a few years and if that red dot is there, I'll be all 'I put
that red dot there!' 'No you didn't' 'Yes I did!'"</p>
