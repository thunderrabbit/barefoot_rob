<p><p class=date>11:35PM July 10 1992 Friday.</p>

<p><p>Yesterday Laura and I had a great day. We started out at the
Clayton library and did some research for a few hours.  I looked up
some of ma&rsquo;s family.  Then we went to Wendy&rsquo;s and ate lunch.  Then to
AAA for some maps for her parents.  And then to ma&rsquo;s work, where we
ate cake and got some info from ma.  We also spent some time talking
to a lady who was playing the harpsichord. Then we went to The
Galleria and walked around for quite a while.  We stopped in a map
store, where she saw one of her friends from high school.  We also
stopped in a gag store and got some envelopes for Maggie Molly and
John.<br />
<br>For John the envelops says Drug Test Resuts
<br>For Molly the envelope says Lottery Winning Notification
<br>For Maggie the envelope says Nymphomaniacs International</p>

<p><p>Then we went to Transco fountain and sat and talked on a bench at
the fountain and then we spent a few hours sitting and talking on the
hill in the duck pond across the street.  We talked about the
(non)existance of God and about our relationship and everything.  Then
we went to my house and made out and talked and ended up having great
sex.  Then I crashed and she went home.  She called at about 2:38AM
(by her clock) to say that she made it.</p>

<p><p>Today after work, Heather and I did some work on our goal planning.
We call them JAM session.  My 3 goals now are to get snadals, get
disposable contacts, and get a new job.  We figured out some specific
steps that we can do this week in order to get them done. Very Very
cool&hellip;  I also had some success with my brain windows in my head.
Later</p>

<p><p class=date>July 9 1992 Thursday 1:05AM</p>

<p><p>2 days ago, Laura and I went to the Clayton Genealogical Library.
Very very very cool.  We looked up stuff.  I looked up my Great Great
Grandparent&rsquo;s on Dad&rsquo;s side.  I looked through the 1900 Census
records.  I found a female named Texas Foley.  I want to research her
further.  I also found Franklin Hess, who at one point lived with his
son in law and daughter and wife and 5 grand kids.  One of the
grandkids was my great grand father.  Word.  I&rsquo;m going back tomorrow
to look up Texas Foley, Franklin Hess, Stuff on Ma&rsquo;s side and a guy in
Missouri named Carmack for Jeanine, who called me tonight.  Later</p>

<p><p class=date>9AM Thursday, July 3, 1992</p>

<p><p>On Tuesday, I went to Laura&rsquo;s house at 1PM.  We went to her end of
the Baytown tunnel and stood in awe watching the huge suspension
bridge that is being built.  (The tunnel is only 2 lanes.  The bridge
is like 12 plus shoulders)  Word.  We went to a cemetary and looked at
some of the stones.  Then we went to The Point and then we got some
hamburgers and ate at her house.  We sat and smiled and went to her
room to play on the computer.  She showed me some different cool
stuff.  I stretched my back and was like &ldquo;ow ow ow.&rdquo;  She asked if
that was a hint.  I asked in my cute voice &ldquo;will you rub my back?&rdquo;
She said &ldquo;sure.&rdquo;  We went into the living room and she rubbed my back
and popped it.  (Popped the shit out of it actually.)  Then I rubbed
on her back and her feet.  Then I gave her a face massage.  She lay on
the couch with her head in my lap and I rubbed her face.  After a
while I leaned forward and kissed her.  We kissed and kissed - all the
while I was caressing her face.  Then she flipped over and climbed up
onto me and we kissed in a more comfortable position.  Wonderful.</p>

<p><p>Her parents called (her mom actually) and we went out to rent
movies.  We watched &ldquo;The Living Daylights&rdquo; with her parents and then
cuddled and watched &ldquo;Dead Again&rdquo; alone.  After the movie we made out
and I fingered her.  She whispered, &ldquo;I want you to make me scream&hellip;&rdquo;
&ldquo;But not tonight,&rdquo; she smiled.  We made out in this manner until 2am.
Then I went home and crashed asleep.</p>

<p><p class=date>10PM Thursday, July 2, 1992.</p>

<p><p>Yesterday at about 7:30PM, Laura came over and we played on my
computer and she fixed windows for me - not totally fixed, but a lot
better. Then we went to Niko Niko&rsquo;s for dinner.  She said it was
pretty Americanized food, but still good. Then we went to Herman Park
area, walked around Sam Houston statue and then to the big sundial. We
sat on the South pointing pyramid and watched people and cuddled.
Then we read about the thing, and a couple with a baby asked Laura to
take their picture.  She did, and then we walked the planets.  We
looked at some of the statistics of the planets and I found a bit of
information that I knew and she didn&rsquo;t: albedo measures reflectivity.
She had taken astronomy but forgot that.  Cool.</p>

<p><p>Then we walked to the feet print courtyard, and then to the
fountain that is ringed by Roman-style columns.  I told her about
Hawaii&rsquo;s Pearl Harbour, and about Katoomba Falls in Australia.  Then
we went back to the car and drove to Marble Slab.  We ate and then
stopped by Kroger to see what was up.  Basically nothing except they
were busy, so we left.  We came back to my house and I showed her my
scrapbook and then I climbed onto the bed and motioned for her to join
me.  She was like, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip; since you&rsquo;ve got all these
women&hellip;&rdquo;  I kinda shrugged, &ldquo;whatever you want&hellip;&rdquo;  So she climbed
into bed with me and we cuddled and kissed, but I didn&rsquo;t get the same
response from her as I had the previous night.  So I asked her what
was wrong.  She said it was because last night was so spontaneous, and
tonight is so planned.  I agreed and after a while of just holding
her, asked what I could do for her.  She said she would enjoy a back
massage.  So I <em>massages</em> her.  All over.</p>

<p><p>Her whole body I massaged.  Her back, her butt, her feet, her legs,
her arms, her hands - everywhere.</p>

<p><p class=note>(28 lines skipped)</p>

<p><p>1 (one) night later, Friday night, I went over to her house.  We
all made dinner, eggs, fruit salad and biscuits.  Very good.  After
that, we had chip-a-roos, (&ldquo;pan cookies&rdquo;) Laura and I stayed up until
2:30AM talking and kissing.  I found out about her love life, and saw
her scrap book.  I almost fell asleep on the way home, but I did make
it.  Saturday (yesterday) was the 4th of July.  I went over to her
house after work and we all made supper again.  We had fried fish and
salad and cornbread.  Then we watched fireworks outside her house.
Then she and I went inside and into her room.  I fell asleep for a
couple hours while she Blue Waved and other computer stuff.  Then I
woke up and cuddled with her and practiced my new memory management
scheme while she read, occasionally aloud.  She quit reading and I
rubbed her back for a while</p>

<p><p class=note>(2 lines skipped)</p>

<p><p>At about 3:30AM, I left and crashed in bed here.</p>

<p><p>During the time that she was describing her previous relationships,
I asked why she was able to make love to me without having a
committment from me.  She said she didn&rsquo;t know and didn&rsquo;t want to
think about it.  I said Ok.  Then she said it may be something about
the fact that I am &ldquo;more realistic&rdquo; and that I know what I
want.. Hmmm..</p>

<p><p>Inside school, I have so far Calculus, Computer Science, and
Physics.  Inside work I pt some produce codes for Kroger.  I also put
a doctor&rsquo;s signature.  In self, I made a self help section and stopped
my ear from ringing today.  I also want to put a clock in a window.
The star in my lower left corner puts me to sleep just like sleep mode
(screen saver) in Windows.  I just pop up my window, move my eyes to
that corner and it makes me fall asleep instantly.  I also have a
temporary memory window.  In that one I store info that I don&rsquo;t want
to keep forever.  Under address and phone number, I have a window for
each letter of the alphabet and then I have names under each of those
and then phone numbers and birthdates in there.  Cool.  I&rsquo;m going to
use my window for a long time to come.</p>

<p><p class=date>Monday, June 29, 1992 8:20PM Saturday</p>

<p><p>We did inventroy in the pharmacy from 8AM to 11:30AM.  Then I went
home and got ready for the Great Super Soaker War Castle of Dreams
Party.  I brought 3 gallons of gatorade and a lot of carrots.  As I
arrived, Windy the Wise came out and watched as the wetness of the
carrots caused one of the gatorades to drop out of the bag and cleanly
break the entire bottom off the bottle and be emptied in <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> second.
We talked and chilled inside for a while until the GSSW started in the
pool.  I went out there and it was great.  The war was mostly mayhem
and fantastic.  While we were at the pool, Trikshot came up to the
fence, &ldquo;this is Guenivere.  This is Thunder Rabbit.&rdquo;  She was
beautiful.  So so so pretty.  I was totally smiling as I offered to
help her carry stuff up.  She was fun.  I went back to the pool and
requested that she join the fun.  She sat up on the steps and watched
at first and then joined us.  I was totally carefully flirting with
her.</p>

<p><p>At one point, I was crouching by the pool filling up the water tank
to the gun I was using.  Night Mage came up behind me and pushed me,
so I braced my hands on the edge of the pool and pushed my legs out
away from the pool so that he lost all his leverage.  I didn&rsquo;t go in.
Dude.  2 of Windy &amp; Tara&rsquo;s kids, Speed Racer and Snow White were
there, trying often to push me in.  Each time, I would grab them and
throw them in.  Finally Speed jumped onto my back and Snow pushed from
one side- so I was leaning over to dump Speed in over my head and to
pick up Snow and throw her in when someone pushed me from behind.
They both fell in and I went in on top of Snow White.  Bonk.  As I
oriented myself, I noted that my leg had gone through the arm hole of
Snow&rsquo;s one piece bathing suit.  Whoops. So as she was standing up, I
got my leg out and grabbed the strap and put it back on her shoulder
where it belonged.  Cool.</p>

<p><p>We all played and played.  Guenivere hopped into the hot tub soon
after I did, and Shadow Thief and Poet and Speed Racer joined.  That
was fun.  I sat underwater for several seconds (probably one minute).
Fun.  We also did some chicken fights.  That was enjoyable.  As a
base, I held my partner up (Speed Racer I think) through 4 other
teams.  Cool.</p>

<p><p>Once, Jack Dracula was having trouble with his water gun.  I
watched this happen:  he pointed the gun up and looked down the barrel
and fired it at the same time.  PPsssshhhhh right in his face.  Oh my
gosh that was hilarious to see his expression.  He was so embarassed
and thinking &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I just did that.&rdquo;  I laughed and told
him, &ldquo;there <em>will</em> be a message about that.&rdquo;  and patted him on
the back.</p>

<p><p>We went inside and ate and then played Castle Charades.  My team
was Windy the Wise, Black Magus, Thunder Rabbit, and Guenievere.  I
sat beside her.  We played for about an hour.  I did &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t she sweet&rdquo;
and I can&rsquo;t remember the other - But I did them both successfully.  We
broke the game for a while to get drinks and such.  When I came back
into the room, Shadow Thief was brushing Guenivere&rsquo;s hair, and she was
in <em>Heaven</em>! Oh my gosh I was so stunned and jealous.</p>

<p><p>Apparently it was very obvious that I was jealous by the way I was
watching her.</p>

<p><p>The game resumed after a while, and I got to sit beside her again.
I rubbed her back some with my left hand, and then invited her to sit
in front of me so I could use both hands.  She said no and actually
asked me to stop rubbing entirely, so I did.</p>

<p><p>The game ended and we went into the room containing the Castle and
played in there.  I came back into the living room and noted Guenivere
on the couch, so I lay in the middle of the floor.  A few seconds
later, I heard a flop of papers land by my head.  I looked, and Laura
had tossed her law school catalog to me.  Dude.  I noted her
initials.  Cool.  I told her, &ldquo;cool initials.&rdquo;  She smiled, and I got
a tad bit of courage and decided to sit by her on the couch.  I almost
sat just on the edge, but I decided, &ldquo;that is stupid.  Sit beside her
like she&rsquo;s a normal body and be her friend.&rdquo;  So I did.  We talked
about her school thoughts and prices and how cool the schools were.
(either she&rsquo;ll go to UH because it&rsquo;s good and inexpensive and
convenient, or to Chicago school because it&rsquo;s a great school)  As we
sat, I found out that she&rsquo;s going to <em>graduate</em> school.
Whoah.  The girl is <em>smart</em>.  I was glad that I chose to be her
buddy.</p>

<p><p>Someone announced that someone else had spent 30 minutes so far
writing an otherwise short message to Guenivere.  So we went in
there.  On the other computer, there was a cool word processor on, s/
(*) so I typed, &ldquo;Thunder Rabbit was here.&rdquo;  and then my tagline
&ldquo;&hellip; Oh, and here is the key to the restroom.&rdquo;  and then &ldquo;~~~
Bluewave/Max &ldquo; A few minutes later, Shadow Thief gave me a hard copy
of it, &ldquo;109 point font&rdquo; he says and handed me two sheets of paper.  He
had printed it out on the ink jet printer.  Cool.</p>

<p><p>Black Magus and Shadow Thief prepared to leave and I walked them
out.  Shadow asked, &ldquo;Why were you giving me those weird looks [while I
brushed her hair]?&rdquo;  I told him it was because I was stunned and
jealous.  I told him that I was in lust with her at first, but then I
decided to be her friend.  I told them that I intended to apologize to
her for flirting so much with her, but that wasn&rsquo;t quite the right
word.  &ldquo;obnoxious flirt.&rdquo; said Shadow.  Perfect.  I told him &ldquo;thank
you. that is the term I shall use.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Black Magus looked up at the sky.  A second later he looked back at
us and said, &ldquo;Damn!  I have to go to Brenham tonight!&rdquo;  &ldquo;What the
hell???&rdquo; we responded.  &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see the stars for these darn lights.&rdquo;
Ha.  we laughed.  Then I looked up at them and said, &ldquo;Damn!  I have to
go to New Orleans tonight!  And be back my 11 AM!&rdquo;  Then Damn&hellip; to
Jupiter  Damn &hellip; to Alpha Centauri.. then &ldquo;Damn!  I have to
Circumnavigate the universe tonight!&rdquo;  Funny.  They left. and I
returned to the Castle. (!!)</p>

<p><p>After a while Trikshot, Guenivere and I walked Guenivere to her
car.  She was in her car and Kirt and I both obviously wanted to talk
to her.  In her words, I looked like &ldquo;a classic image of a young boy,
carving an arc in the sand, hands clasped behind his back, asking a
girl to his first dance.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>So we both wanted to talk.  She had to leave, so I just told her,
&ldquo;Laura, I apologize for being an obnoxious flirt.&rdquo;  She smiled and
said it was Ok, &amp; that she didn&rsquo;t mind at all.  Cool.</p>

<p><p>After that, Kirt and I talked for about 2 or so hours until almost
3am.  We talked about Guenivere and what he wants in a girl and what I
want and computers and everything..</p>

<p><p>Sunday morning I left a private message for Laura on the Castle.  I
gave her my address and phone number.  She called Sunday at about
10PM.  We talked until 2AM.  We discussed everything that occured at
the Castle Party and laughed about every inch of it.  My jealousy, and
flirting and coments that I had made, (&ldquo;You know you&rsquo;ve got me by the
ears.&ldquo;) the fact that she didn&rsquo;t flirt back to much becausekrit was
there.  So funny.  We flirted like crazy over the phone.  She gave my
a verbal back massage at the very end, just to ensure that I would
have sweet dreams.  Wonderful As we hung up, she said, &ldquo;Goodnight,
Snuggle Bunny.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Monday I was dancing all day at work.  I was ecstatic.  I was
singing and carrying on; everyone knew I had a new girl.  4:30PM came
and I raced home to see if Laura had called.  <em>She had come
by</em>.  There was a note in the mailbox saying she had come out to
see if she could find me.  AAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!  I read the note about 20
times.  Oh my god she had been right here!  She called me at about
10pm and we talked till about 1AM.  We confirmed a lunchtime meeting
today at 1PM (6 hours from now )  I behan to describe my back massage
method on her.  &ldquo;Is this phone sex?&rdquo;  she asked.  &ldquo;If you want it to
be.&rdquo; She begged me to stop after a while because she couldn&rsquo;t stand
just to imagine it, but not feel it.</p>

<p><p>We discussed genealogy, and she will show me around some archives
some time.  Cool.  She was impressed and pleased that I was
interested.</p>

<p><p>At the very end, she said, &ldquo;Goodnight, Snuggles.&rdquo;  Oh - I asked her
what her favorite snuggle position was.  She describe one of my
favorite, too.  Me snuggled in behind her, mathcing her body
countrous.  Word.  RIGHT!!!</p>

<p><p>(It&rsquo;s now Tuesday morning (I started this entry last night.)  Laura
called at the (!!) page 109) See the &ldquo;s/&rdquo; on page 108 by the (*)?  that &ldquo;/&rdquo; was
designed to be an &ldquo;o&rdquo; but the phone rang as I was writing it.  It was
Tammy.  I jerked when the phone rang.  Whoah!!  Funny.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Animals are not spare parts.&rdquo;  apparently read the sign of some
animal right protesters in response to a guy receiving a baboon
liver.  I just heard that via Barsky on 104 KRBE.  cool.</p>

<p><p>I decided to give Castle of Dream names and real names.</p>

<p><p>This morning I woke up at about 5AM because the stupid fish tank was so loud.  I went in there, and noted that the tank was only half full.  Holy Shit.  It turns out that over the night, one of the hoses had come loose and was siphoning the water onto the floor.  Damn&hellip;  I filled the tank partway back up and I&rsquo;m letting it be oxygenated and lose its chlorine and stuff.</p>

<p><p><b>Quickly:</b> What are you up to lately?</p>

<p><p><b>Subject:</b> Castle of Dreams and the GSSW</p>

<p><p><b>Comment:</b>
<br>Dude!  I just wrote this totally long-assed post - and the system just ate it when I hit the escape key.  Who wrote this BLOGish software anyways?!?!<br>
<br>
Finding your site, and finding the Castle posts was just too great an event!  Jo and I had been talking about the Castle with the kids lately (we have handles of Deek and Nim in a game and had to explain where the handles came from) and I called Victoria to come up and see your post.  (Jo&rsquo;s concerned with her reading any more of your adventures from back then.)  Just the other night, we were all in the car and we started talking about the Castle again - and I started going over our visitors.  Ryan liked the name, Thunder Rabbit, amd Victoria asked if I&rsquo;d talked about you before.  I remembered then, that I used you as an example of why she needs to wear her helmet when she goes blading.  I also told her about the time I tried to push you in the pool and how your handstand out of it was the most awsome feat of athletic skill I&rsquo;d ever seen. <br>
<br>
I found your site while searching for the Castle - I had hoped someone thought of it well enough to write something somewhere on the net, but no hits.  Looking for Thunder Rabbit finds video games.  Looking for Jack Dracula gets the stories of some California tatoo parlor (that&rsquo;s the problem with getting your handle for a Gibson novel).  I couldn&rsquo;t remember Gary&rsquo;s handle (Scout Seven) so I searched ofr his real name, found some bicycle events that he must&rsquo;ve ridden in, and found your journal entry about sliding on the ice with him in Hermann Park.  I looked up your e-mail address from your domain registration, and sent you the note before being sure that you are Thunder Rabbit.<br>
<br>
Last night I told Jo about finding your website (actually conversation was more like - &ldquo;What was Thunder Rabbit&rsquo;s last name?  I thought I found his website, but I&rsquo;m not sure.&rdquo;).  I had to do some shopping (supposed to be for meds for her cold, but also got the champagne and strawberries for tonight - 13th anniversary!)and when I returned, Jo had found your site and found all these old entries for the days of the Castle.  <br>
<br>
Wow, and if only the &ldquo;more years&rdquo; link worked correctly on your site, Google might&rsquo;ve searched these older issues too, and I&rsquo;d have found you before you headed off on your adventures.<br>
<br>
Jo and I are now living in Sugar Land.  For a while we had the old apartment and an apartment in Dallas (I rebuilt all the computers/networks and stuf for Addison in &lsquo;97 and &lsquo;98), but when my Dallas gig was up we decided it was time to get a house - and the kids were ready for school so here we are&hellip;.  A couple nights ago Jo and I went to the open house at the Middle School where Victoria will be going - feeling the tug at the heart strings as she grows up.<br>
<br>
I remember in July of &lsquo;93 turning 30 years old, out of work with Jo also out of work, the Princess at home and the Prince en route.  Suddenly I felt all the pressure of my family relying on me to be dependable about work and making an income and everything else.  I know that I sacrificed just about everything in the next several years as the Castle died from inactivity to make it in my career - and I made it.  But I think back to those parties and to how few people we know now - seems like the cost was kinda high.<br>
<br>
I miss you guys.<br>
<br>
Jo did remind me that somewhere I still have the videos from the Castle parties (including the mistletoe cam, and also the one with the movie of you and Gary holding your breath in the hot tub) and so I may have to get them converted to DVD.  After Jo and I read your post about the Christmas part, she stunned me by bringing out the stack of poloroids we used to make the poster, and we went over all the pictures.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your kind thoughts and warm memories served up on the Internet.  I&rsquo;m not far enough along in the &ldquo;Story of Rob&rdquo; to know how long you will be gone - but I have the impression it will be for a while.  Just know that when you return, you owe Jo and I a visit.<br>
<br>
With warmest possible feelings,<br>
Your friend,<br>
James Crossman, Night Mage</p>

<p><p class=date>Friday June 26, 1992 10:10AM</p>

<p><p>Last night Marcel, Steve, Me, Fred &amp; Jodi met at the House of Pies
on Westheimer.  We played frisbee for a while in the parking lot
waiting for Laura &amp; James &amp; Casey to show up.  Frisbee ended when Fred
almost took out a big-ass window of a restaurant.  We ate &amp; laughed
and it was great.  I got a load of ice cream on my strawberry rhubarb
pie.  Cool.  Then we split, except for Marcel and Steve and I, who
went to Transco tower to play frisbee.  We pretty effectively
disturbed several couples who were making out of benches.  There was
even a couple laying down (fucking?) on the grass.  Cool.  We played
until we were darn sweaty and then parted ways.  This morning I read
more of The Chronicles of Amber, which Fred brought home from dad&rsquo;s.
It&rsquo;s a cool book.</p>

<p><p>Just now I was remeniscing about old times and I suddenly thought
of Maggie and I on my bed facing eachother with my arm on her side and
shoulder and we were talking and smiling.  I miss Maggie.  I miss her
smile.</p>

<p><p>So I just now called her 10:18 AM.  Very nice to hear her voice.
&ldquo;Yeah!  I want 10! 15 hours of sleep at night!&rdquo; says Maggie in her
cute voice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s vitally important that I get it,&rdquo; she says of Tiny
Toon card number 65.  Now it&rsquo;s 10:48 AM.  I just got off the phone.</p>

<p><p class=date>Wednesday June 24, 1992 11:30PM</p>

<p><p>Yesterday I called Wendy on a whim and drove out there and we
walked on the railroad tracks by her house.  We got to a tressell(sp)
and when we were below it, we heard a train coming.  So I clambered up
the rock slope (I was barefoot) and barely popped my head up to see
the train.  It was close.  So I reached up just my hand up between the
ties of the tressell and placed on the track the Diet Coke can from
which Wendy had finished drinking.  The I stood below the railroad
tracks.  The train was Hauling Ass.  It was traveling very fast.  The
whole tressell was like humming before the train got to it.  Then
louder and louder and <b>WWWHHOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMM</b> The train blasted
over my head.  I was so impressed.  I watched it from that vantage
point for a sec, and then climbed out beside the tressell.  There were
water drops flinging off each car.  They seemed to be moving forward
relative to the train as they came off.  I noted that the last car was
not a caboose, so I got a rock, and tossed it into the last truck of
the last car.  <b>Clinnk!</b> It may as well have been hit by a
baseball bat.  The rock flew about a hundred feet. (Really) and landed
within 8 or 10 feet of Wendy and then it bounced past her.  Holy shit
that could have knocked her out&hellip;</p>

<p><p>I was looking for the can, when Wendy said, &ldquo;I caught it!&rdquo;  She had
fucking caught the can one hundred feet from where I put it on the
track.  Wow.</p>

<p><p>Then Wendy and I saw Batman Returns.  It was stupid.  Then we
watched a lightning storm until 1am and then I left but just went to
Ma&rsquo;s house in Magnolia.  It turned out that Fred was there, too, so we
spent the night there.  Later.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ve been up since 7:30 AM.  I did laundry, went to work, came home
and played on the computer some.  Then I&rsquo;ve been writing messages for
the Castle of Dreams for the past 6 hours.  I finally got them done,
and now I&rsquo;m trying to stay up until 5AM when I can upload them.  (4AM
- 5AM = mail hour) Mail hour fro BBS.s No humans allowed.  I&rsquo;m going
to try again.  I have to be up in 6 hours to take Ma and Jan to the
airport.  Later.</p>

<p><p class=date>3:35 AM Sunday, June 27, 1992.</p>

<p><p>I got my computer working.  It Rocks.  RIGHT!!!  It is incredibly
faster than my other one.  Flight Simulator has smooth scrolling
effects while flying and everything.  I&rsquo;ve got 4 megs of memory, 2 of
which are being used as a disk cache.</p>

<p><p>Yesterday after work, I rode Bruce&rsquo;s bike from my house down
Montrose to Allen Parkway, turned right on Allen Parkway and rode to
the place where they filmed a taxi commercial, then back down Allen
Parkway all the way into River Oaks where it turned into Kirby, and
then followed Kirby through River Oaks till it hit San Felipe.  I took
San Felipe to Heather&rsquo;s apartment and stopped there for a while to get
a drink.  Then I took W Gray down to Montrose and then right on
Montrose to Herman Park.  I rode the equivalent of around all of
Herman Park 1.5 times and then went back via Montrose and Marble
Slab. Marble Slab was a mistake; it made me <em>so</em> thirsty.  So I
stopped in Kroger and walked Bruce&rsquo;s bike back to the water fountain.
I only had shoes and shorts on.  They were incredibly busy, heh
heh.. Then I went home and wrote messages for Castle until I went to
bed at 10:30PM.  Molly called just about then and we talked for an
hour.  Very cool.  I woke up at 3AM to go shopping for about 10
different items, and to say &ldquo;hey&rdquo; to Matt, the guy who won 50 bucks in
the lottery.  (He worked from 11PM to 7AM today) Kroger door said
&ldquo;closed till 5:30AM&rdquo; but I went in anyway and Gail graciously let me
shop in spite of the fact that she was doing a sales report.  Cool.
So I got my stuff and here I am.. Now I&rsquo;m going to bed again.</p>
