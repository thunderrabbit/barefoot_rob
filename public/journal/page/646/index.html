<p>Wende and I watched <em>Blast From The Past</em> last night.  It was great!</p>

<p>I was actually pretty surprised at how well I liked it.  I thought it
would just be a cheesy romance thing, but I was laughing at the
situations and all the wacky funny stuff!</p>

<p>Given the plot, the resulting situations were believable (assuming
they could in fact survive 35 years in a large hole) and quite
entertaining.  Good ending and all that.</p>

<p>The funniest scene to me: he was outside skating, and some beautiful
women skated by and smiled hugely at him.  His eyes kinda went gaga,
but it turns out, not at the skaters!</p>

<p>Go check it out!</p>

<p>I owe about $9526.98 to various credit cards, $300 to Maggie, and $500
to my dad.  Right now, being in debt really bugs me, so I&rsquo;m focusing
lots of my funds to pay it off.</p>

<p>At my new job, I bring in a tad over $800 on the 15th and last day of
each month.  Looking back over my finances, I pay a tad over $400 to
rent (this varies as I do some work for my landlord), $23 or so for
natural gas and electricity, some for groceries, some for cell phone,
..  okay I haven&rsquo;t really looked at my finances that closely but I&rsquo;m
beginning to do so.</p>

<p>Back to my credit cards.</p>

<p>I called the 4 banks (banks?) and determined my balance due, credit
available, payment due, and interest rate for each:</p>

<p>card      bal        credit    interest
          due        avail
Card A    630.82     5068      4.9%
Card B    187.54     4812      9.9%
Card C    1425.96    6074      18.1%
Card D    7282.66    217.34    12.96%</p>

<p>Nice.  Obviously I need to transfer funds from Card C and Card D with
their huge interest rates.  So I had Card A write a check for $1425.96
to Card C, and a check for the rest of my credit available to Card D.
I think $3642.  So once those go through, I believe the table will
look like this:</p>

<p>card     bal        credit    interest
         due        avail
Card A   5698.78    0         4.9%
Card B   187.54     4812      9.9%
Card C   0          7500      18.1%
Card D   3640.66    3859      12.96%</p>

<p>Card A said it should take 7 to 10 days for the funds to be transferred.</p>

<p>Right now I&rsquo;m going to call Card B and have them write a check to Card
D for $3600.  Hold please.</p>

<ul>
<li>-</li>
</ul>

<p>HOLY COW!  I just did that balance transfer without talking to a
human!</p>

<p>So after that goes through, I think my table will look like this:</p>

<p>card     bal        credit    interest
         due        avail
Card A   5698.78    0         4.9%
Card B   3787.54    1212      9.9%
Card C   0          7500      18.1%
Card D   40.66      7460      12.96%</p>

<p>Card B said it would be 3 days, so it may even go through first.</p>

<p>Please note that Card A interest rate is good for 6 months from the
day the balance transfer occurs.  In April 2000 it will jump to 13%,
so I will have to remember that then.</p>

<hr />

<p>When I graduated from UH, I had about $26,000 in debt: $14,000 in
student loans, $8,000 in credit cards, and $4,000 in hospital bills
(from my skating accident)</p>

<p>In 2.5 years working at TeleCheck, I was able to pay all that off, and
save $10,000.  In 1.25 years of bumming, I spent the $10g, purchased
$4027 in various internet stocks (actually $117 in brokerage fees and
$3910 in stocks (now worth $2818)) and accrued the debt above.  It&rsquo;s
been fun; I&rsquo;ll enjoy the process of paying off the debt.</p>

<p>Now here&rsquo;s a weird question I must ask myself: If I am losing dollars
in the stock market, is it better to sell all the stock ($105 in fees)
and pay off credit cards?  Or carefully see which stocks are going up
and which are going down and sell the downward spiraling stock?  Or
trust they will all come way up in the long run and just sit on them?</p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;ll just sit.</p>

<p>I also think I will put the above credit card debt table on the front
page of my website.</p>

<p>Crazy?  No - I hope whoever sees it will become a bit less tight
lipped about their debt.  Nearly everyone in this society owes big big
money.  Why not talk about it and say This is Crazy! and quit spending
to Impress the Joneses (or to make ourselves feel better) and live
better in the long run?????</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently on hold with Microsoft support.  Christian is helping me
figure out how to get MS Personal Web Server to support SSL encryption.</p>

<p>Relatively speaking, the support has been good though Christian is the
third person I&rsquo;ve spoken with (let me transfer you to the correct
department)</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s not why I&rsquo;m writing.</p>

<p>I got my linux box back up!!</p>

<p>The saga is long and arduous - here is a short version:</p>

<p>Problem:  I ran out of disk space on my 1 gig linux disk
Resources:  I have an 8 gig disk with windows on it
Goal: put windows on 1 gig disk, and linux on 8 gig disk
Saga:
* I archived windows stuff
* Installed linux 5.0 on 8 gig disk, but it wouldn&rsquo;t boot
* Tried Boot Magic; tried Partition Magic
  this required reinstalling windows because BM and PM won&rsquo;t install
  on linux
* Tried linux 6.0
** got linux 6.0 installed but it wouldn&rsquo;t boot
* Tried Boot Magic; tried Partition Magic
  this required reinstalling windows because BM and PM won&rsquo;t install
  on linux
* Reached a point where I had windows on a small partition and linux
  6.0 across the other partitions
* Was able to boot linux 6.0 with a floppy
* Could not get linux 6.0 to connect to internet (PPP)
* Said forget 6.0
* Reinstalled linux 5.0 and magically, it is able to boot.</p>

<p>The ** above indicates a error on my part: I installed linux 6.0 on my
linux 5.0 drive and wiped out all my old linux info, unfortunately
including all old email messages and the current in-progress Feel Good
Net issue.</p>

<p>The good thing is that I now have grand incentive to find a driver for
linux to use my ZIP drive.  Also, I learned several cool things about
linux, making me even happier with my choice to use it.</p>

<p>Over the four or five days my computer was down, I received 81 email
messages. Many of them, yes are from email lists: youth related and
Flashnet related. But most of them by far are people sending me crap,
with a few good messages mixed in. I have added filters to my inbox to
help with the load.</p>

<p>So tonight I&rsquo;ll be working more on my computer (after my I-group
meeting); maybe I&rsquo;ll figure out how to get java to work so I can have
ICQ at AIM at my house again!</p>

<p>Oh, the other cool thing is that because both disks are on the same
machine, (I have an extra computer with no drives, and) linux is able
to write directly to the windows directory, making it TONS easier for
me to transfer between the systems on the rare occasions that I need
to. Nice.</p>

<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll trade my other PC for a laptop.  It&rsquo;s a PII 233mhz with a
KILLER video card.  Hmmmm.</p>

<p>Last Tuesday I had fun at KTRU.  So much fun that I still want to
write about it 6 days later!!!</p>

<p>I had made a decision before I even started to play &ldquo;Coffee&rdquo; by Awol
off of a certain SKA compilation we have.  It&rsquo;s a good wake-up song
that I thought would be appropriate for 9am.</p>

<p>The song happened to be track 3 on the CD.</p>

<p>Ah, a gimmick for the day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;HI This is Rob, and you&rsquo;re listening to K T R U Houston, 91.7fm.  I
have decided to only play track 3 from any CD I play today.  Or only
song 3 from any vinyl I play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I enjoyed the slight added challenge of finding CDs that would nicely
clash (I like to play jazz, then hardcore, then light classical, then
ska - keeps people wondering) <em>and</em> that had good songs for
track 3.</p>

<p>But the funniest funniest thing:</p>

<p>I found an audio book called <em>The Bear That Wasn&rsquo;t</em>.  You know,
like a book on tape so you can listen in your car?  Well, this was on
vinyl.  Well, not actually vinyl, but that old hard thick plastic that
was used for records back in the day. Remember?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t remember, but I know they were old.  Anyway, this &ldquo;book&rdquo; had 4
disks, and labels &ldquo;side 1&rdquo; through &ldquo;side 8&rdquo; on them.  I&rsquo;ll just play
side 3.</p>

<p>So I cued it up and it was all,
&ldquo;mmmmmoooooorrrrroooooollllaaaaammmmmmmm&rdquo; too slow, so I put it on
45rpm &ldquo;mmmoorrroowwwwaammmm&rdquo; still to slow????  OH my gosh it must be
78rpm!!</p>

<p>Our turntables don&rsquo;t have a 78rpm option.  But, they don&rsquo;t have to be
powered by the motor in order to produce sound.  So I spun the record
with my finger!  I just guessed at what sounded correct as far as the
voices and it was great fun!!  Just the grand silliness of me
broadcasting over live radio, on hundreds of thousands of dollars of
equipment, spinning Side 3 of <em>The Bear That Wasn&rsquo;t</em> with my
finger.</p>

<p>That is why I love KTRU.</p>

<p>Today I had a great day at work.</p>

<p>This was the first day I worked on one project pretty much all day.
The goal was to get our NT workstations to act as secure web servers.
We already have Personal Web Server installed on them, but they had no
option to be secure servers.</p>

<p>The call to Microsoft helped fix that.  It took a couple of phone
calls, and actually Kristian called me back (I misspelled his name
previously) at one point and helped me get all set up.</p>

<p>So my PC is able to be used as a secure server for testing purposes.
Great!</p>

<p>I also had fun chatting with Zara and kT over ICQ.  Zara is in San
Antonio, kT here in H-town.  We just talked random silly stuff, a lot
while I was on hold.  I&rsquo;m now zipping off to I-group.  Have a great
day!</p>

<p>In a way it&rsquo;s kind of refreshing.  In a way it kind of sucks.  I wiped
out my linux drive at home. That means I also lost all my email and
stuff from before the 22nd.</p>

<p>(So if you sent me an email before 22 Sept, it&rsquo;s gone.)</p>

<p>So here&rsquo;s what happened: I began to run out of drive space on my 1.1
gig drive that was on my linux box.  I was running an 8 gig drive on
my Windows box, and certainly didn&rsquo;t need all that space there; I
rarely use Windows!  So I decided to switch them.</p>

<p>I archived the windows info that I cared about, and attempted to
install linux on the 8 gig drive, leaving the 1.1 gig drive alone.</p>

<p>Got it installed, but it wouldn&rsquo;t boot!  I think that Windows ate the
boot partition of the drive so Linux&rsquo;s boot manager, Lilo couldn&rsquo;t
function.  Grrr windows.</p>

<p>Tried to use my 1.1 gig linux drive to access the 8 gig linux drive,
but couldn&rsquo;t get them to happily coexist in the same machine.  (that
was a problem with Bios configuration; neither OS was at fault).</p>

<p>My dad suggested using Partition Magic, and or Boot Magic to get stuff
to work.
I drove to his house to grab the disk, and he actually had a linux 6.0
distribution.  Cool!</p>

<p>Got home and found that in order to install either Partition Magic or
Boot Magic, I had to have a windows partition.</p>

<p>I reformatted a 2 gig partition of the 8 gig linux drive to allow
windows to write to it. I was able to view the Boot Magic CD, but it
needed Windows to run.</p>

<p>So I installed Windows in the 2 gig partition of the 8 gig drive.
Actually had some problems with that: &ldquo;Windows will now scan your
system for devices; your system could hang&rdquo; It hung. Twice.  But I got
Windows installed.</p>

<p>I got Boot Magic installed.  Only thing was now I had a windows
partition on my drive and I didn&rsquo;t want that.  I want linux!</p>

<pre><code>    Some of you are asking, &quot;why go through all this trouble to
    get linux?&quot;  (Right now I'm asking the same thing.)

    Once I get it working, the OS is way more stable; it doesn't
    crash randomly with vague error references.  If a program
    crashes, it crashes cleanly and doesn't affect the whole
    system and interface and everything.

    Linux is free. Windows is crappy bloatware that costs tons of
money and breaks randomly.  Plus, running linux is just cool.
</code></pre>

<p>I focused on getting both drives to work in the system at the same
time.  With a few jumper changes, I was able to get both going.  I was
not able to figure out how to get the 1.1 gig drive to boot and simply
use the 8 gig drive for extra storage. In retrospect, I shoulda spent
more time on that.</p>

<p>Next thing I did was reinstall linux on the 8 gig drive and I
formatted the 1.1 gig drive in the process.  Bye bye email.  bye bye
website backup.  bye bye ftp information to update websites.</p>

<p>I actually have the ftp information so that&rsquo;s okay, but it&rsquo;s still a
big pain in the bootay.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, even though I installed the 6.0 version of linux, it
still won&rsquo;t boot by itself.  (I am able to boot it using a floppy)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to try a couple of more variations - the one I can think of
now is to install linux on the 1.1 gig drive and see if it will boot
by itself then.</p>

<p>A different unresolved issue is this: I don&rsquo;t like the new graphical
desktop that came with 6.0.  It&rsquo;s called GNOME, and I think I&rsquo;d prefer
to have the 5.0 X windows desktop. GNOME looks a lot like Windows
(trying to coax mainstream people over) and I just don&rsquo;t like it.
GNOME also seems to have some bugs that I can&rsquo;t quite articulate now.</p>

<p>However, the 6.0 version has updated libraries and stuff.  I think
what I may do is the following: Try to get GNOME to do what I want it
to do; or get rid of GNOME and go back to X Windows; or install 5.0
and try to update the libraries.</p>

<p>For now, I&rsquo;m doing email and website updates from work.</p>

<p class=date>20 September 1999</p>

<p><p>So much fun!!!!!</p>

<p><p>Kristen and I went to Galveston yesterday morning - left around
10:30am.  We did a quick driving tour of the new <b>Spur 5</b>, the
new big entrance to UH!  It&rsquo;s pretty freaky to have a highway plowing
through where once was just trees and field, not to mention the site
of Frontier Fiesta some years ago (1993?) when I was so active in SPB
(Student Program Board) and helped set up stuff in the field..
amazing.</p>

<p><p>Got to Galveston, and drove west down the seawall a few miles to a
little less popular beach which she frequents.  There were only like 5
people there when we drove up, 2 of them fishing out in the water.  We
parked, walked, plopped our stuff down near some <em>old</em> car
frames buried in the sand and halfway covered in the wash of waves.</p>

<p><p>I studied the car frames as Kristen soaked up some sunrays.  After
about 20 minutes, I was able to identify a few things - the steering
wheel was still vaguely intact on one frame, and even part of the
stainless steel windshield wiper bases.  The rear bumper was still
strong, and the rear axel was there.</p>

<p><p>The other frame was a bit trickier.  Finally I noticed - <em>oh,
it&rsquo;s upside down!</em> and things became a bit easier. I could see a
wheel well, the frame of the back seat, the muffler and part of the
steering rod for the front wheels.  Quite interesting seeing the
history there. I understand why archaeologists love their work!</p>

<p><p>I showed Kristen my findings and we swam around in the water and
watched little fishies and some birds dive bombing the water for food.
I noticed what appeared to be fish under the surface, but then I
realized they were jellyfish.</p>

<p><p>Yikes!  I sure didn&rsquo;t want to be stung by them and headed away, but
Kristen was all, &ldquo;no, they&rsquo;re cabbage head jelly fish!  C&rsquo;mon!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>She was wading her way toward them and I followed some ways behind her.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t sting?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Not these, apparently, and we were actually able to scoop them out of
the water for brief inspection!  They were so&hellip;.  oogy slippery
see-through clear and smooth like little watermelons with hundreds of
&ldquo;feet&rdquo; on one end!  Yipes!!!  I was pretty icked-out giggly excited to
touch/hold them, but they kept like rolling so their feet would touch my
hands and I&rsquo;d shriek and drop it back in the water.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m not usually a pansy, but it was just so foreign to me.  Eeek!!   Too
many monster movies I&rsquo;ve been watching apparently.  Next time I will be
more brave.</p>

<p><p>We floated around in the water for a while longer until we actually started shivering as some wind had picked up. Waded back to shore and lay on towels to dry off and got a tad burned.</p>

<p><p>Kristen fell asleep for a bit while I drove us back to Houston area. Dropped her off and I went home to bed too. Wonderful fun day.</p>

<p><p>Awesome!</p>

<p><p>For the first time in a pretty long time I went to play Ultimate
tonight. Ultimate is a great game played with a flying disc
(&ldquo;frisbee&rdquo;).  A group of people have been playing at UH every Saturday
night for several (ten ?) years. I joined them in about 1993 or so
when I was in school there, and was consistent until I graduated.  I&rsquo;d
like to become a consistent player again.</p>

<p><p>Anyway, it was great to be back in action and only took me a few throws to get my accuracy back pretty well. (It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;ve never touched a disc since I&rsquo;ve been out there, but just not each week.)  A couple of times I made some great fast break passes to work the disc down the field.  A different couple of times I had some great almost-catches, both of which resulted slight abrasions on my legs (left knee and right calf). And a couple of times I had great catches and great throws and even got a few points for our team.</p>

<p><p>Super great night, so come on out and play any Saturday night at 10:30pm at University of Houston at Entrance 5 off Wheeler Drive.</p>

<p><p><hr></p>

<p><p>Also tonight (before Ultimate), Kristen and her mom had a combined birthday party thing and I met a dude named Willy (really) who used to be a marketing agent for Tommy Boy Records!  I was all, &ldquo;House of Pain?  Cypress Hill?&rdquo;  Yup.  Wow. He&rsquo;s gotten to hang and befriend Everlast and DJ Lethal and I&rsquo;m really impressed.  (Some of you are all, &ldquo;<em>who?</em>&rdquo;)  We talked plenty and I told him I&rsquo;m a DJ at KTRU and he&rsquo;s going to give me some CDs from some unknown local bands that have a new genre of music that I think he called &ldquo;Dominion.&rdquo;  It&rsquo;s apparently a mix of hip-hop and gospel.  I&rsquo;ll see if we can get it on KTRU!</p>

<p><p>Also at the party, Todd and Wendy were describing a business lunch they attended at a fancy ass restaurant and it turned out their business partners were in the mob. (Whatever that means right?)  Well, apparently they were all talking about guns and huge money deals and drinking lots of $180/bottle wine and Todd &amp; Wendy were pretty intimidated.  It&rsquo;s a much better story they way they told it!</p>

<p><p>Tomorrow morning Kristen and I are going to the beach.</p>

<p><p>Wende is at a great spiritual weekend workshop thing, and I greatly look forward to hearing about it tomorrow afternoon!</p>

<p><p>Friday night is <a href="https://mkultra.txraves.org">MK Ultra</a> night at KTRU, so I cruised out there to say HI to Tejus and Eric, who was spinning ambient techno on the air!  Eric is great fun (same Eric who I DJed with about a month ago 1-4am) and I feel a certain comradery with him, since he&rsquo;s just getting started a spinning and mixing vinyl. It was great to watch and talk and see him get better.  He had great segues in his hour set except for one killer that elicited an agonizing groan from him as my ears went, &ldquo;ouch!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>When he was finished, Eric went home and Dustin came in to mix.  He scratched some records, including some old classical albums that are free for the taking at the station and Tejus and I were so impressed!</p>

<p><p>At 1am when the next DJs came in for their general shift, the input level for the mixing turntables is supposed to be turned off. (The DJs mix in a room different from the control room.) Tejus went in to get some lessons from Dustin on scratching and I noticed it was being broadcast over the music that was supposed to be playing! A caller called and asked for Tejus and I was all, &ldquo;um, he&rsquo;s busy being broadcast but he doesn&rsquo;t know it; are you listening now?&rdquo;  The caller was, and we all had a good laugh. Even Tejus when he found out about it.</p>

<p><p>Last night after work I drove to KTRU to drop off a CD I had reviewed.  It&rsquo;s a good CD; got a good review. I had one problem, though; I left the CD at home and had just brought the case.  Doh!</p>

<p><p>After that I cruised to Mad Potter to paint my plate and Jennifer was there, &ldquo;hey let&rsquo;s go for a walk.&rdquo;  We walked and she expressed a large amount of confusion and general unhappiness about some people in her life.  I listened and (hopefully) helped her make some decisions about how to handle the various situations.</p>

<p><p>Then went over to Kristen&rsquo;s to watch a movie. We talked and stuff and when her brother Matt got home, he was all, &ldquo;where&rsquo;s the dogs?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Apparently they had gotten out of the outside gate when Kristen let them outside.  We hung out outside in the street for a bit while Matt drove around the neighborhood looking for them. Two relatively big german shepherds. Found them and turns out one had hurt her foot; couldn&rsquo;t walk. We determined it was just a surface wound and not a broken bone or anything. That&rsquo;s good, but still bad in a way.</p>

<p><p>Then we started the movie and it <em><em>SUCKED</em>!!</em></p>

<p><p>I encourage everyone to not see <em>Another Day in Paradise</em>.</p>

<p><p>We didn&rsquo;t finish the movie.</p>

<p><p>I left late, went to Wende&rsquo;s to help her eat the ice cream that was slowly melting in her freezer that&rsquo;s not working very well.  Then it was even later, so I spent the night at Wende&rsquo;s house and had good breakfast and ice cream in the morning before work.</p>

<p><p>Today at work I&rsquo;ve been mostly spending the whole morning messing with a UPS (not United Parcel Service, but Uninterruptable Power Supply) that doesn&rsquo;t seem to work correctly no matter what combination of com ports, cables, or software versions I&rsquo;ve tried.</p>

<p><p>At one point, a peer of mine was talking to the rep at the UPS place and they were both frustrated and almost got grouchy at one another. Fortunately my peer got a phone call and had to leave the room.</p>

<p><p>Still no success on the UPS. So now I&rsquo;m going through the process of renewing our digital ID key thing with VeriSign, so we can have a secure web server.  So much stuff to learn!</p>
