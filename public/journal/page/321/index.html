<p>Aw man.</p>

<p>It started off so well.  2:20ish train from Tsunashima.  Four hours
and ten minutes available to make a two hour trek.  But.  We got way
lost getting to Narita airport.  Not like way lost but somehow in
Ueno, we got on the wrong train and are in Narita, but not near Narita
airport.  Fuck Japanese train stations, man.  They stink.</p>

<p>Now we're in Narita-not-near-Narita-Airport in the chilly wind
waiting 30 minutes until we a train that'll take us to Narita
arrives.  Bluh.</p>

<p>I reallllly hope janette makes her flight.</p>

<p>Another weird thing is that we haven't seen any ticket gates since
Shibuya station.  We've only paid as far as Ueno.</p>

<p>Oh, ps: I knew how to get to the airport if we had gotten off the
Yamanote Loop the station before Ueno, but I had heard it's not a big
deal to get there from Ueno, and the last time I went to Narita I
noted that the station before Ueno (notice that I can't remember its
name now, the main reason I missed it) was in fact the second station
on the line from Ueno to Narita.  My presumption was that we could
therefore just get on that same line at its first station and zip to
Narita no worries.</p>

<p>Except for the part about finding that same line in Ueno.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Super strange also that the train needs to go from left to right to
get us to the station.  From the platform perspective, trains have
*always* gone from right to left (circulating on the left side of the
'road')</p>

<p>Zoom from the shuttle toward the ticketing area.</p>

<p>"American Airlines?"</p>

<p>"Over there but the gate is closed.   What is your destination?   Dallas?"</p>

<p>"Hai."</p>

<p>headsetphone guy behind booth.  bag X-rayed, baggage can't be
checked, must be carried on, but still got checked bag tags just in
case.</p>

<p>Zoom this way.  I lift both janette's bags over my head to get past
the turnstiles behind janette behind the guy.  White shirt black vest
red tie greets us. (This is it; quick hug kiss; "bye") Guy takes her
black suitcase.  Black vest zooms her through security express line.
Wave bye.</p>

<p>Guy came back.  "She's gonna make it on time."</p>

<p>"Domoarigatogozaimas."</p>

<p>janette still hasn't gone past the gates.  Oh, there she goes.
Wave bye through the glass.</p>

<p>Oh they're going past me.  Quick pick before they descend the
escalator.</p>

<p>"Bye."</p>

<p>Bang.  Then it hits.  Zoom to restroom, private stall.  Cry cry
cry.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Okay.  I'm okay.</p>

<p>Good thing is that we extended our time together to the max.</p>

<p>Bang.  More crying.</p>

<p>Cute girls from Sweden.  Buzz off.  I give not a second glance.</p>

<p>Starbucks hot chocolate for comfort.</p>

<p>Speed-train to Yokohama = 4000+ yen.  I have 4000 yen.  1000 yen
train to Ueno, here I come.</p>

<p>I predict a <em>pissed off</em> day at work tomorrow.</p>

<p>We just now got on this backwards going train and I ripped my
shorts sitting down.  Gah.  These are the shorts that janette
painstakingly converted the broken snap into a working button and now
they're ripped in the back.  Stupid fuckin' grr grr grr.  I don't want
janette to leave and I don't want to have ripped my shorts and I don't
want to go to work tomorrow.</p>

<p>And these aren't just a pair of my standard Utility brand cargo
shorts.   These are the zip-off-legs cargo pants that Wende bought me
some time ago.  Really light fabric that I think will be fucked up to
mend neatly.</p>

<p>Well, if janette misses her flight, she'll have time to mend these
shorts.</p>

<p>C'mon train, let's *go* already.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Got off at Terminal 2, where I picked up janette.  Talked my way
past the screener (I'm carrying her shiznit, geatch) and went up three
sets of escalators ("I think I'm going to make it."  "Me too.  I'm
really happy about that.") to the departure area.  Info counter:
"wrong terminal, jack."</p>

<p>FUCK.</p>

<p>Lunch at a place near the 100 Yen Store where they did not have in
stock any more canvases for me to create art.</p>

<p>This morning I read chapter xxxiv (I think) of Stranger in a
Strange Land to janette.  We were interrupted by two men at the
doorbell who wanted to clean the apartment.  They were sent by Nova
because the apartment was less than nice and clean when it was
inspected some couple weeks ago when they inspected it before Dan
moved in.</p>

<p>Since janette has been here, the apartment has been relatively
immaculate, and I felt a bit they couldn't just accept that and leave.
But they cleaned some places that would never have been cleaned -
behind the paneling around the tub, and they replaced the air filter
above the stove etc.  Okay fine.  You can stay.</p>

<p>But then they left and all was clean.  Still.</p>

<p>Went to Shinjuku where we heard some music that janette quickly and
correctly identified as Peruvian.  These cats were performing on the
sidewalk - 5 guys with guitars and electronic drums and wooden flutes
and shakers.  Watched with janette until I had to go meet Yumi for her
lesson at Gateway 21.</p>

<p>Lesson was fun; told her all about my vacation and tried to explain
the different between "talk" and "say."  eek; I don't think she quite
got it, but we came rather close I believe.  She asked though.  Ended
the lesson by planning our next lesson (next week, same bat time, same
bat channel) during which we may go seek ice cream!</p>

<p>Found janette talking to one of the Peruvian guys, who has been in
Tokyo for 10 or so years, performing gigs and on the street.  Pretty
cool beans.</p>

<p>Walked with janette to the NS Building and took her to the top
floor before she saw the huge clock.  She was awed by the view from
the bridge across the top of the middle of the building, though I was
less than awed: the lovely tile design that I expected to show off to
her had been covered by some black fabric and some sort of
demonstration with bright lights that could have been for a TV
studio.  And we saw what looked like a man on his back wearing only
blue pants.  An operating mock up?  hmmm.  Quite interesting.</p>

<p>Down to the 23rd floor, I showed her the door of the Nova head
office (we didn't go inside, though she liked the carpet in there),
and then to the first floor to discover, in fact, it was a mock up of
an operating room, with a rubber human with blue blanket folded up
over his legs lying on a bed with TV screens showing his vital
signs.</p>

<p>"Rubber heart bouncing consistently at 60 bounces per minute."</p>

<p>Stood in greater awe looking up at the <a
href="/images/travel/japan2003-2004/001_first_week/japan-Pages/Image2.html">giant
clock</a> on the wall which indicated 9:20pm.</p>

<p>Showed her the towers from which we can see the whole city ('cept
they were closed for the night) and then found the wind-blowable
statue thing was being blown more readily this night than I've ever
previously seen it.  Cool.</p>

<p>The moving sidewalks into Shinjuku station were off for the night,
but we got to see the Shinjuku Eye and janette almost correctly found
the correct-direction Yamanote line before I did.</p>

<p>In Shibuya we said HI to Hachiko once more and walked across the
sea of humanity intersection and ate at the Mexican place down the
street.</p>

<p>Came home and watched chiwawaworld.com ads.  Most are dumb, but one
is funny funny.</p>

<p>Bedtime.</p>

<p>My bike was fixed today!</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>We rode toward Kawasaki, but didn't make it..  stopped at a park
where I read to janette while she repaired a broken snap on my shorts,
replacing it with a button.  Magic.  And she mended my bicycle
gloves.  *And* she mended a velcro pocket thing on the shorts I was
wearing at the time.  Absolutely amazing.</p>

<p>We made it home in plenty of time to munch dinner with Shin at
Miho's.</p>

<p>Dinner with Shin was like a food giving away contest.</p>

<p>Shin and janette talked a lot and I transcribed a lot of what they
said.  This transcription was sent to Shin so he can practice it at
his convenience, grokking the sentence structures so he can use them
later.</p>

<p>Miho kept bringing us food like wow..   Maguro (raw tuna), tempura,
something (beef, potatoes with glass noodles), yakitori (skewered beef
tongue and veggies and beef bits and chicken globs), and baked squash
with mayonnaise dressing.</p>

<p>Feast.</p>

<p>Lazy day today.</p>

<p>Read couple chapters to janette.  Annotated a few images from our
trip.  Colored a canvas thing for janette.  Went for a walk</p>

<p>oh oh oh and we happened across the shinkansen tracks as we were
headed down a super steep hill it looked like something was coming UP
the hill *really* fast and I was like, eeep!  and then I saw it was a
shinkansen flying past and underneath us and then before it went by
<em>another</em> shinkansen went by the other direction.
WHOOOOOOOSH!!!</p>

<p>We hung out there for 20 minutes until about 6 trains had gone by.
Wow.  Shinkansens are *fast*.  ZOooooooooooom.  If Fred comes to
visit, I'll definitely take him to that spot.  Wow.</p>

<p>Walked to the corner store (not on a corner) and then across the
street to a park to eat our fruity jello treats.  Watched 7 high
school boys try to ride on a bike.   Twice they got four people on the
bike and rode around with little problem.  They could almost get five
people on it and ride around, but not for very long.   Basically the
guy in back had to run behind the bike until it got moving and then
jump and piggyback on the fourth guy's back.</p>

<p>Been reading comics from comics.com on my secret comic viewer that
bypasses all the ads and stuff.</p>
