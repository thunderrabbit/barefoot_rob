<p>"I better say something meritable so Rob will write it down."</p>

<p>"What a world where the leading rapper is white, the leading golfer
is black, the French think Americans are arrogant, and the Germans
don't want to go to war."</p>

<p><img src="/images/peeps/Ma/RobMahug24Mar03.jpg"
align="left"> So GREAT to see my mom again.</p>

<p>I told them what I knew about my apartment, my city, my roommates,
etc etc.  Yammered a bit about the stupidity of war and the
awesomeness of Macs.</p>

<p>At first I was like "erg" and didn't want to drive all the way to
Waco just for lunch, but something about being so frustrated by the
phone made me really really really appreciate seeing ma.  Gave her a
bigger hug than ever because of that phone.</p>

<p>She brought a pile of my clothes - lotsa rally t-shirts and many
ties and I don't know what else.  I thought there might be a suit in
there but I don't see it.  No worries; I only need one.</p>

people and so <em>clean</em>!!!</p>

<p>Lawren came over today (after church I guess).  So awesome!  We
chatted a bit and she drove me to Movie Trading Company to get a used
copy of _8 Mile_ and then we stopped at MJD Designs and got paints and
paper so I can paint for Janette.</p>

<p>Really awesome that she took time to come over once more before I
go.  I'm so lucky to have people around me who love me!</p>

<p>About two weeks ago I got an email that included "The job sucks,
but Japan is pretty good." from someone.  I figured he was just a bit
cynical maybe, didn't like teaching people the same thing over and
over or whatever.</p>

<p>So I was all, "meh," and decided to still respect the company and
want to do the right thing and buy the right clothes and just amaze
the fuck out of them about how awesome an instructor I'll be and have
everyone love me <em>the most</em>.</p>

<p>He subsequently told me what type of clothing was appropriate, but
not what shoes, so I asked what type of shoes were good to wear.</p>

R,

Any kind is fine. Slip on slip off is pretty much the standard. Have
more than one pair so that you don't wear them out; plus it rains alot
and you will need an alt when they get wet.

I don't know what your work experience is like, but be ready to take
some shit and produce a terrible product. Many of the NOVA teachers
have drinking problems. You can never say you were not warned.
</pre>

<p>Woah.</p>

<p>That's the first chink in the armor....  </p>

<p>Ya know, fuckit; I still haven't seen it for myself.</p>

<p>I don't mind posting the above possibly incriminating email because:</p>

<p>1) free speech</p>

<p>2) no one at Nova likely reads my site</p>

<p>3) sounds like if they fire him, he won't mind</p>

<p>Tonight I showed Janette the clothes that I bought with Fred's
input yesterday.</p>

<p>She liked them.</p>

<p>I just realized like *oh shit* just realized I gotta get cash from
my bank, but I use an electronic bank with no edifices (edifi?) to
visit and be like, "gimme my money."  I called my bank and they found
an ATM close to me that they own and which therefore will not charge
me fees to withdraw copius quantaties of moolah.</p>

<p>Going to meet my mom tomorrow in Waco and hopefully she got my
message to bring the ties and clothes that I archived with her at the
beginning of my adventure.</p>

<p>Right now my to do list looks approximately like this:</p>

<pre>

</pre>

<p>Oh, gotta add toiletries to the list.  Added.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I've noticed something after getting that email from Frank.  I have
a sense of relief, of .... something that means I'm not quite as
intimidated by my upcoming job situation because they are just people
too.  If these cats have drinking problems, then that's just fine.  I
can have a I-don't-really-know-how-to-match-clothes problem, or a
I-haven't-been-studying-Japanese-very-much problem, or some innocuous
thing like that.  I'll be just <em>fine</em>.</p>

<p>Plus, as Janette has said a few times, "you can always come
back."</p>

<p class=date>11:44pm</p>

<p>Speaking of Janette, she's sleeping beautifully, and I'm going to
begin painting a painting for her.</p>

<p>Awake.  About to go shopping.  Jack has requested a ride somewhere
so I can hopefully just drop him off.</p>

<p>So funny that I'm a bit apprehensive about shopping:</p>

<p>I've never really done it alone before; I've always had a
mom/girlfriend with me on shopping adventures in the past.</p>

<p class=date>1:23pm</p>

<p>Got like 8 pairs of slacks and 4 white long sleeve shirts and some
t-shirts.  Aww yeah.  The slacks are all the right size, but I just
guessed on the white shirts.</p>

<p>Chatted online with Chez and then called her to just yammer about
funny stories and stuff, ..  I told her about the Alphabet Game and
she told me about a mad libs (on computer) rap and rapped the first
3/4 page worth of it (out of 6 pages).</p>

<p>We decided we'll definitely write to one another while I'm in
Japan.  None of this "I'll write you!" and not do it.</p>

evening sometime after she gets a prom dress.  I wonder who made the
<em>cut</em> to be her date???</p>

<p>Just got a call from Jackie; she can't come play tonight, but
she'll come on Monday to cut my hair.  Whoooo!</p>

<li><p>I've not yet purchased all the clothing I think I'll need, much
less packed yet.</p></li>

<li><p>I've given Scott to Janette, effectively to Josephine.  We
figured that would be easier since Josephine doesn't have a TDL
yet.</p></li>

<li><p>I've pretty much said Bye to everyone.  Plan to see my mom in
Waco on Monday or Tuesday cause she wasn't in Austin yesterday or
today.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In a way that feels blessed and lucky and wealthy, I have somehow
accumulated $3600 to take with me to Japan.  One of the ways I've
accumulated this is by working.  Another way is by borrowing money
from friends.  Another way is by not buying anything for the past
couple months except with credit card.</p>

<p>I'm relatively certain I'll be quite able to pay everything back
quickly, like I paid back my student loans back in the day.  Back then
it was $14,000 dollars I think, plus the remains of $4,000 medical
bills from bonking my head.  This time it's like $6000 total (actually
less), so I'll be able to knock that out quickly.</p>

<p>Living in Dallas with Janette has been an absolute blast.  We play
and goof around all the time, going for walks and random adventures to
random places (lake, woods, railroad tracks, houses being built, Austin,
Houston, back alley, snow, rain, sunshine, cloud watching...) it's
been sooo great.  I'm really going to miss her while in Big J.  Or
should I call it little J?  or Crowded J?  Or just Japan....</p>

<p>Anyway, I have lots of questions and few answers about what life
will be like overseas.  I just gotta (resume and) keep practicing
Japanese, focusing on my quest to become fluent in 3 more languages by
2010.</p>

<p>Oh, I've decided I'm not coming back to US for the year that I'm in
Japan.  Any vacation I get I'll use to explore more areas, not come
back for a short week to rush around hugging all my friends.  After my
contract, maybe I'll take two months off and hug everyone back here.
It just seems so silly to come back for a brief emotional frenzy in
the middle, so I won't do it.  I can predict heart-wrenching when I
hear/read about rallies and especially SWUUSI, but I've got to
continue boldly forth.</p>

<p>We're outside for Fred's 3pm class talking about logarithms.  He's
showing them how to multiple log base 2 of 6 X log 4 base 6.  Turns
out that it's log 4 over log 2.</p>

<p>We've eaten lunch and such, oh and he told me that he's decided to
buckledown and study for the qualifiers and pass them and be accepted
into the PhD program here at UT.  yay Fred!!</p>

<br>Actually, I&rsquo;m in the PhD program in Math at UT now, and the decision was to buckle down and <em>continue</em> in the PhD program, rather than jump to Civil Engineering or move to another university.<br></p>
