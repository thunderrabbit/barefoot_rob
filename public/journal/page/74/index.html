<p>Well!  I discovered something new about Tokyo trains.  If I <em>promise</em>
to pay at the other end, it&rsquo;s possible to get a free entry ticket.  I
did not think to take a picture of the ticket, but its kanji started
with 無 and may have started with 無理 but I am not sure I can readily
identify the second kanji.</p>

<p>Anyway, I called Ty and he met me at his station to let me out.  And
gave me 1000 yen so I can get home and maybe get a bite to eat.</p>

<p>Headed to Paola&rsquo;s house now to enjoy lunch and laugh about leaving
wallets at home!</p>

<p>I woke up at 4am with no alarm, and then actually got up at 4:26.
Chatted with Jason and Jimmy for a second before getting to work.</p>

<p>Work included getting Ansible to create directories for a SB website on
AWS.  Basically I am tweaking the playbooks and roles from AB website
to work on SB website.  I need to make them a bit more generalized,
but to a degreee, I think they are pretty good.  There is a bit of
non-3rd Normal stuff (the expected deploy script is named after the
website) but I think that is reasonable.  Oh, maybe I can make the
name deploy_backend.sh in the role, and then change it to
deploy_sitename_backend.sh on the server.</p>

<p>Okay I am going to snooze a bit on the train.  Oh, today I am subbing
for Matthew near Zavas.  Yesterday may have been Chika&rsquo;s last day in
class.  I bought Country Ma&rsquo;am strawberry cookies for her.</p>

<p>I finally glued the last piece of the M Splitter.. and it works!
Marbles roll down it faster than I had hoped, so I considered lowering
it.. but there is <em>just</em> enough room for the small marbles to roll
<em>under</em> that track and onto the small marble track which has walls on
it, if I lower one of the walls.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that wall is also the support for the track, so it will
be tricky to cut.  I might have to use the dremel or something..</p>

<p>Oh, so while installing the supports for the M Splitter, the
red-and-white headed character knocked over the ramp.  Then the
character who helped install the ramp fell off the stage where the
ramp had been.</p>

stayed out late with peeps from co-gender group.  I will still get

woman. Everyone on the bus exclaimed, but the bus driver took off
before anyone moved.</li>
<li>I nearly completed the M Splitter on Marble Track 3.</li>
<li>I tried getting Netlify CMS working, but still have a few bits
missing, starting with authentication.</li>
<li>I failed an test at TY.  There will be other chances, but I felt sad
because I had thought I would do better.</li>
<li>Eight men attended men&rsquo;s circle last Tuesday.  We may have even more
this coming Tuesday.</li>
<li>I finished <em>The Saint&rsquo;s Rise</em>; Michael said my edits/comments were great help!</li>
<li>Sleeping Bag, the first classical music event where attendees were

detected by Lastpass when I tried to log in to Pocket with Firefox.  I
wonder if it&rsquo;s an OAuth issue (cross site security)..</p>

<p>Only one hour so far today on Marble Track 3.</p>

<p><a href="//b.robnugen.com/art/marble_track_3/construction/2017/2017_nov_25_top_view_half_glued_half_m_dropper.jpg"><img src="//b.robnugen.com/art/marble_track_3/construction/2017/thumbs/2017_nov_25_top_view_half_glued_half_m_dropper.jpg" alt="2017 nov 25 top view half glued half m dropper" /></a>

<p>The images above show the track before and after having glued the
second support on the first half of what I am calling the M Dropper or
M Splitter.  It will split the medium sized marbles off the large
marble track by being too wide for the medium sized marbles to touch
both sides of the track.</p>

<p>35 more minutes during this break to let the glue dry, and then I will
hopefully get the second half of this track glued today and have the M
Dropper working yay!</p>

<p>Well I haven&rsquo;t yet glued the second half, but I did get to the point
where I need to clip the first half, so I just bought some clippers
(whereas I had hoped to buy a saw blade for my drill).</p>

<h2 id="17-31-saturday-25-november-2017-jst">17:31 Saturday 25 November 2017 JST</h2>

<p>The new clippers are pretty great!</p>

<p>Now three of four points are glued on the M dropper.</p>
