<p>Last night when I went skating, I did some car surfing.  It's similar to 
people surfing, but I use cars.  The streets are all one way, so traffic is 
pretty predictable.  At the top of a hill (a hill for Houston), on the left
hand side of the street, I wait for the light to turn green and I start off 
with the cars as they go through the light.  Cars are parked in the left hand
lane, so at the next intersection, sometimes I have to get between the second 
and third lanes as a car turns left from the second lane; I don't want it to 
squish me.  Then I zip back to between the parked cars in the first lane with
the moving cars in the second lane.</p>

<p>Twice in the five times I did it last night, I crouched down underneath a
moving truck's side mirror as I zipped by within the four foot space between
the truck and the parked cars.</p>

<p>At the intersection at the bottom of the hill, I'm usually ahead of all the 
cars and I zip over to the left hand sidewalk to go back do it agian.</p>

<p>It's extraordinary.</p>

                        <p class=date>4 June 1996</p>

<p>Back in about mid-May I had a super awesome skating adventure.  My friend
Marcel had called me to say basically, "Hey- they're almost done building 
the new Tollway down near my house.  Let's go skate on it before it opens!"
Excellent idea.</p>

<p>I picked him up after work and we cruised down to his (& Kayse's) apartment.
We goofed around on his computer a bit (cause we're computer nerds at heart)
and then we drove out to the Tollway.</p>

<p>It kinda felt weird parking blatantly by the toll booth plaza, but hey,
what could be more convenient?  Certainly any cops would understand that.
We put on our skates and hopped over the wall onto the Tollway.</p>

<p>Skating on a giant shimmering expanse of fluorescent lit concrete is unique.
Amazing what details we freely experienced that thousands of drivers would 
soon pay to whiz past.  Unfortunately, most of the details were relatively 
bumpy grooves across the whole highway, and not designed with skaters in mind.
We had a goal, though, and it was still two and a half miles away.</p>

<p>So we kept on skating, eventually up and over a small hill--an overpass I
believe.  It was nothing compared to the overpass looming ahead.</p>

<p>Before reaching the looming overpass, we found a giant jungle gym / monkey 
bars in the middle of the Tollway!  They were only six feet tall, but easily 
sixty feet long.  The steps were too large for a child to climb, but I was 
able to carefully(!) clamber up to the top, amazed at the thickness of the 
steel, and the size and number of bolts holding the whole thing together.  
Marcel and I guessed we could get 15 or 20 thousand dollars if we could 
just get the thing to a recycling center!</p>

<p>We reached the start of the exit ramp that sailed up and up and up and over
Interstate 45.  The thing was big.  No question in our minds about whether 
or not to skate it.  We examined the area for any potentially disastrous
accident sources, and found none.  Well, none except the large piles of
guard rails in the middle of the lanes.  At least they were easily visible.</p>

<p>On the way up, we encountered more guard rails in a pile, which were also
not yet doing their job of keeping us on the highway.  We had other incentive 
to stay on the ramp though, so we did.  The wall on the edge of the highway 
on which the rails would eventually be attached was just a rebar skeleton,
like a giant snake ribcage stretching for miles across the overpass.  The 
ribs were spaced far enough apart to allow a skate between them, and just 
tall enough to catch a careening skater at the knees, inducing several 
seconds of freefall gymnastics.</p>

<p>From the top, we could see three searchlights dancing lazily across the clouds
in the north, and one brightly twisting in a parking lot just south of us.
Marcel wondered how many we might see from an airplane.  I suggested we could
see the most searchlights from an airplane if it were a foggy night below us.</p>

<p>We were way up there.  Below us were four layers of highway, with presumably
16 or 18 feet between them, and each at least 4 or 5 feet thick.  That would
put us about 100 some-odd feet high.  We had to be higher.  It seemed we were 
at least ten thousand feet in the air.</p>

<p>For several moments, we experienced the view, commenting that we would later
be paying motorists, privileged to shout, "we climbed it!  We skated it!"</p>

<p>We skated slowly(!) toward the inner edge of the turn, which was fully 3 feet
lower than the other side as the curve was banked.  I gripped the rebar
ribcage as I looked over the edge to spit...  Wow.  It fell forever.</p>

<p>Back up to the center of the roadway, we were all, "Dude?"  "Dude."
We gave each other five and started down.  I pushed myself a bit faster down
the hill into the darkness, then I just let gravity do its work.</p>

<p>I could see essentially nothing as I careened faster faster fasterfasterfaster
.."yyaaaaaarrrrrgggggghhhhhh!!" I growled out loud, praying not to hit a stray
bolt that would send me tumbling, sprawling straight to the hospital.  I 
rocketed past the pile of guard rails and toward the bottom of the hill.  
I was fully crouched, with my arms pointing forward, ready to grind my wrist 
pads to dust if necessary.  Past the guard rails at the bottom of the hill, 
I began to stand up and slow down.   Heart excited, adrenaline racing, I 
safely stopped and turned around to find Marcel.  He was nowhere in sight.  
Hmmm.</p>

<p>Uh oh.</p>

<p>Then I saw him skating smoothly down, doing amazingly well for one of his
first times on skates.  "Excellent!" I greeted him at the bottom.</p>

<p>We skated back to the truck and went home.</p>

<h2 id="8-06am-thursday-30-may-1996">8:06am Thursday 30 May 1996</h2>

<p>See, all the stories of cool innovative things I&rsquo;ve heard (like last night,
I met Mandy, from London, who has been for years fascinated with textiles and
cloth.  She kept buying cloth pieces until she had trunks full.  She didn&rsquo;t
know why she had it, until she started creating hanging cloth art, that could
be arguably described as quilted, but is definitely unique and intriging.
She is beginning to sell her work, and loves what she does!) that people
do to make cash have all started with them breaking away from the norm and
just doing what they <em>love</em> with all their heart and then developing it into
something where they can make money at it.</p>

<p>Where is <em>my</em> thing?  What do <em>I</em> love to do so much that I can just do and
create and continue until I can make a living on it?</p>

<p>My life currently is a big mishmash of stuff that I&rsquo;m doing in all variety of
different types of things like working with youth at church, doing email,
skating, playing frisbee&hellip;.  But none of them are something I <em>LOVE</em>.. Arg.
What I want to do is make money while helping the rainforest.  Once I&rsquo;m out of
debt, I&rsquo;ll help with the rainforest <em>free</em>; just give me a place to sleep and
something to eat and I&rsquo;m happy.  Maybe I can volunteer for now.  I just need to
call them up&hellip;.</p>

<p>Okay!   I called Christine, a friend of mine who used to work for the Earth
Foundation.  I&rsquo;m going over to her house and we&rsquo;ll figure out all the details
of how I can work for them.  Thank you!</p>

<p>(that was all written to someone named Karen)</p>

<p>I know I was ontrack last night.  Christine called me just as I was
going to leave and said &ldquo;gimme 30 more minutes.&rdquo;  No problem.  5 minutes before
I was going to leave, Danielle Jensen came in, &ldquo;Rob???&rdquo;  Turns out she had
just told Soren she wanted a divorce.  Shit.</p>

<p>I called Christine, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be a bit late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Talked with Danielle for a bit and told her all about my SLA recovery and that
it&rsquo;s not all superfantastic fucking all over the place.  I told her how many
hearts I had broken, and about the abortion I had to pay for, and about being
pissed at myself for fucking one more each time I did.  I told her about the
dichotomy of passionate making out with Donatella, opposed to fucking Kris the
next day or so and how I had had so much more respect for Donatella than I
did for Kris.. I should have mentioned that I&rsquo;m still in touch with Donatella,
but not with Kris.   So I told her all this shit about how it sucks to fuck
around and that I couldn&rsquo;t make her not do it, but that it was not great fun
all the time.</p>

<p>I suggested that she not go run back home, &ldquo;Soren, I&rsquo;m cured!&rdquo;; she still
needs her freedom.   I gave her big hugs and tried to make sure I kept from
kissing her too much.  We never kissed on the lips and I feel like I was
successful in keeping my bottom-line behavior from happening.  I really
wanted to make out with her.   Happily, I didn&rsquo;t want to fuck her.</p>

<p>Went to Christine&rsquo;s and told her all about what&rsquo;s going on with me and she
didn&rsquo;t tell me about her stuff since I didn&rsquo;t want to hear about how great
she&rsquo;s doing with that guy. (How could I have forgotten his name just now?)
Christine didn&rsquo;t mother me, and I only asked for one cookie, and I left
when she requested verbally and we were pretty aware of what all was going
on between us.  Nothing sexual except a few swats on the ass (not spanking)
and I again believe I did no bottom line behavior.</p>

<h2 id="96-05-30-08-04-06-st1m5">96/05/30 08:04:06 st1m5</h2>

<p>Here we are and I&rsquo;m almost not quite late for work.</p>

<h2 id="96-05-30-08-06-56-st1m5">96/05/30 08:06:56 st1m5</h2>

<p>I just figured out a cool way to get individual timestamps in here.  I made
a file called timestamp which I can reset the time in and then just copy it
over here.  It only works up to the first 8 lines, and it would change all the
time stamps in the file, but I want them unique, but accurate..</p>

<h2 id="7-32pm-thursday-30-may-1996">7:32pm Thursday 30 May 1996</h2>

<p>Got it!!</p>

<p><code>M-x set-variable</code> to set the <code>time-stamp-format</code> variable.  I <em>love</em> emacs!!!!</p>

<p>Fuckit!  The thing didn&rsquo;t save it after I quit emacs and reran it.</p>

<p>(I will figure out how to make the timestamp the way I want it.)</p>

<p>Last night I went to Nancy&rsquo;s wonderful dinner party and met Mandy, Lisa &amp;
Evan Daily (sp), Pamela &amp; Ford.  Ben Easton was there and me and Nancy.
Everyone was so <em>real</em> though I first thought Lisa looked a bit too good
for the rest of us, but after sending the talking rock around at opening
circle (at a dinner party!) we had all described where we were and Lisa&rsquo;s
seemed nearly the most emotional.  Wow.</p>

<p>Dinner was tremendous.. Practically too good for me. ;)</p>

<p>Talked to Ben, who hang glides out in Katy!!!!  I&rsquo;m totally interested in
going to watch this weekend.  After that, I&rsquo;m totally interested in going to
fly sometime.<br />
Ben played for us an audio tape of an orchestra performance he wrote and
conducted.  Way major cool.  It sounded like the background of a cartoon for
me, deep an menacing at first, and then light and airy near the end.  His
project was to use as many instruments as possible.</p>

<p>Mandy creates art out of sections of cloth.  Nearly quilting them together,
for a totally unique artform.  She loves to do it, and it appears she&rsquo;ll
start making money at it.</p>

<p>I have been skating lots and lots lately, and have written no stories
since they're all about the same.  Tonight, skating was different.</p>

<p>Today the Olympic Torch was paraded down Memorial Drive into downtown
Houston, and we skaters were invited to skate with the parade!!  I got to
Memorial Park area at 6:30pm, expecting a much smaller crowd than what I
found.  There were tons of people on foot, skates, bikes, cops on horses,
and lots of golf carts parade vehicles full of people.  Three hook-n-ladder
fire engines, 3 or 4 trucks and/or trailers with varied groups all in
costume.  Area Youth Choir, Texas Army, some cloggers, some African style
drummers, cheerleaders, something else, a few Art Cars, and 10 count-em
10 BMWs with various celebrities in them. (More on one of those in a sec)
</p>

<p>While the parade assembled, I skated up and down the row of vehicles, 
talking to various people from various places.  I talked to Leonard, who I 
knew as a cartoonist from UH, and who was now taking photos for the UH paper.  
I told the kids in the choir, "yes, I *promise* I actually shook hands 
with one of the Rockets."  (I don't know who, but he was tall.)  The cloggers
asked where I got my knee pads; they have a dance(?) move or something that
requires them to kneel hard on the floor.</p>

<p>Pretty quickly, it became 8pm, and time for the parade to roll.  We skaters
snuck our way right in front of the front BMW, which happened to be carrying
Kim Zmeskal, Gold(?) Medalist from the 1992 Olympics!  I was amazingly 
pleased with that.  I said HI to her a bit, that I'm a non practicing 
gymnast, and that I still have a photo of her from Time magazine in my
scrapbook.  (Oops.  I just checked, and apparently I was mistaken.)</p>

<p>For the first 15 or so minutes, I skated up and down the length of about
half of the parade, until I got griped at by a cop.  So, I went back up 
to where the skaters were and talked with Kim.  Turns out that she skates.
So I gave her our "Come Skate with US: Urban Skaters" card, and she said
she may join us. (no pun intended)  That will be totally cool if she does.</p>

<p>The parade went under a bridge that had cool sloping concrete, and only
a few people under it.  I skated up and down it about 4 times, pleased
that I never wiped out.</p>

<p>Near the end of the route, we skaters were not allowed to join the BMWs
to the backstage area of the final torch area thingamajig, so we skated
around to the front with the rest of the public, and they had singers and
speakers and the mayor said some stuff and then there were fireworks and
all that.  During that time, I met Sonja, who I realized, as soon as she
said her name, that I had met her over a year, maybe 2 years ago, skating.
Wow!  I told her that I remembered her as the first female skater I had
ever met who would jump ramps and do all the cool stuff that some of the
guys would do.  She replied, "that *was* a long time ago!"</p>

<p>After all the fireworks and such, Sonja and I skated over to Jones Plaza,
where it was SuperTejano night.  (I guess it would be pronounced Ho'nace
Plaza)  We sat and watched Ed and other skaters grind on the steps.  Ed was 
practicing a new soul stance(?) or something equally impressive.</p>

<p>Sonja and I cruised over to Texas Club parking garage, one of my favorites
in Houston.  I suggested that we not go to the top floor, so we could
avoid seeing the sign that says "NO SKATING."  About halfway down, Sonja
slipped and scraped her leg a bit. (yeah yeah that's why the sign is there.)
She sexistly said, "no sweat; I'll take it like a man."  We skated the rest
of the way down without incident.</p>

<p>Skated to Brewery Tap, where we got water and Sonja cleaned her abrasion.
Then we skated over to Fuzzy's where she was parked, and we talked a bit with
Oliver, foreign exchange student from Germany.  We taught him some Texan
slang like, "We're fixin' to skate and I recon y'all can join us ifyewanoo."
That was entertaining.</p>

<p>It became pretty late, so we went home.</p>

<p>Last night I experienced a new cool level of skating..  I called a couple
of friends until I found that Susan was home and wanted to skate.  We went
out west of Houston, out near Bear Creek Park.  By the time we got there, it
was 8:30pm or so, and vaguely dark outside.
<br>She showed me a jogging/biking/skating trail that wound its way through some 
trees sans lights.   This trail is like 10 feet wide and nice smooooth asphalt.
There was absolutely no one out there, except for an armadillo that rooted
under some brush as we sailed past.</p>

<p>The air was cool; the night was getting darker.  We approached a lighted area
which turned out to be a vacant parking lot and playground.  We stopped briefly
for water.  As we started again, it was darker, and our eyes had become
un-adjusted to darkness.  We continued through the trees, eventually rolling
smoothly over a bridge that presented a small change in elevation that normally
would be no big deal, but we had to rely on only our feet to tell us how 
steep it was.</p>

<p>We got to an area where the trees joined at the top from across the path, 
effectively blocking all light.  For these portions, I noted that dark shapes
in the trees seemed to spill into the trail.  If I looked down at my skates, 
I couldn't detect the edge of the path; I had to look straight ahead where
I could *vaguely* tell where the trail went.</p>

<p>Mosquitoes unwittingly attacked us as we plowed through.  Suddenly one of the
dark shapes seemed to move across the path.. Or stright toward us.  A guy-on-
a-bike shape went past.  Why didn't that naughty boy have lights on??  Why
didn't we have lights on?  At least I was wearing my white NO FEAR shirt.
I pointed out to Susan that she was wearing black.  "I just realized that,"
she replied.</p>

<p>Ahead were some more lights, in the form of a busy street crossing our trail.
We pushed the WALK button, but skated across instead.   Several minutes after
that, we arrived at another park.  We got a drink and chilled for a second 
before we headed back.</p>

<p>On the way back it was pretty dang dark.  I can't lie and say it was pitch
black dark, but it sure wasn't very light.  We crossed the busy street again
and soon got to the portions where the trees obscured pretty much all light.
I could only barely *barely* see where the trail was if I looked way in 
front.  After a bit, we knew the bridge was coming soon, (or was it?) but
we just kept plunging through the dark, hearing noises (rabbits?) (bears?)
(zombies??) scamper around the brush beside us.
<br>
The bridge appeared in the form of "whoah!" as we adjusted for the sudden
dip in elevation.</p>

<p>The rest of the journey was mostly not shrouded with trees.  We got back
safely and soundly.   I will do it again when it's darker.</p>

                        <p class=date>Happy Easter!!  7 April 1996</p>

<p>Today I joined some of my friends out at Memorial Picnic Loop to
skate and have a picnic and skate some more.  The place was *packed*.
At first this kinda bugged me, but then I realized that the cars
slowly driving through the loop made great obstacles!  I carefully
skated past them, around them, or between them, (not over them) at
high speed.  I found that essentially no matter how close the cars
drove together, they would leave at least 6 inches between the
mirrors.  That allowed me to tuck and skate under the mirrors between
the cars if necessary.  I totally loved it.</p>

<p>At one point, about 8 or 9 such daring (or stupid) skaters were ziggin and 
zaggin through the cars.  We had great fun.</p>

<p>At one other point, I zigged when I should have zagged, and suddenly there 
was a skater in front of me where I wanted to go.  Doh!  I could not put 
on the brakes fast enough to stop before I kaplowed over the skater, so 
I grunched into the car beside him.  My shin made a resounding thunk on the
trunk and has a pretty good lump on it.  I made amends with the driver before
I continued.</p>

<p>At a different other point, I saw some of the guys I had been skating with
stopped in a parking area.  So I stopped over and they said they had a ramp.
I was all, "um, no- I don't have knee pads on today so I shouldn't"  One 
of them brought it out and I noted it was a straight ramp, as opposed to
a launch ramp.  Hmmm..  Okay.. so I did it.  The first time, no sweat.
The second time, I kinda messed up my landing, so I slid on my skate boots
and wrist guards.   "Did you hit your knees?" they called.   "Nope!  I was
like Bambi on the ice, but I did not hit my knees."     Whew.     
I jumped once more very small jump with no problem.</p>

<p>I skated around the loop a total of about 12 times, I'm guessing.  That would
make it about 14 miles total.  Great skate for a great afternoon.</p>

                        <p class=date>5 April 1996</p>

<p>Last night my adventure started at Fuzzies, which, actually has been closed
for non-payment of taxes for a while now.  We've been meeting in the parking
lot across the street.</p>

<p>I saw my friend Danielle, who was in her car on her way to the Jones Plaza.
I was on my way there, so I had her pull me!  It was pretty cool, though we
"only" went about 20 mph, which is the speed at which the traffic lights are
timed.  (Sometime in my life I want to skate 60 mph.)  I simply hung onto 
her open window.  That way I was able to see any potholes or bumps in the 
road and easily avoid them. She pulled me about 6 or 8 blocks.  I was a bit 
nervous about cops, but it was way too much fun to be *that* nervous about 
them...</p>

<p>At the Plaza, I watched the skateboarders and aggressive skaters do all 
variety of grinds and jumps that I feel would necessitate wearing a helmet.
The only pads that I saw were some knee pads and shin guards.  One of them had
on a shirt that said, "IF IT CAN'T KILL YOU, IT'S NOT A SPORT."  That 
actually is about what I think, but I *do* wear a helmet.</p>

<p>I personally didn't do anything amazing at that point; I'm still
letting my bruised hip heal.  (I didn't even do a single parking
garage last night...)  I want it to heal before I go back to the skate
park tomorrow.</p>

<p>A group of us skated to The Big Easy, via Domino's Pizza, where there was a 
live band playing (at Big Easy, not the pizza place).</p>

<p>I met a guy named Scott, who is starting a business of renting time on 
paragliders.  To fly a paraglider, you have a big parachute thing over your 
head, and a big fan tied to your chair and you can fly around!  They have 
about an 80 mile range, so I think I'll rent one, and fly over to my dad's 
house!!  Ohmygoodness, the more I think about that, the better it sounds.</p>

<p>I also heard about some other *cooler* (cooler = faster and more
dangerous) sports that I want to try, like roller "surfing" using a
big ram-air parachute-looking thing to pull a person on wheels across
the salt flats in California..</p>

<p>And about some guys who had tremendous-wheel-size skates and totally flying 
down an amazingly steep smooth mountain highway..  I have *got* to try that.</p>

<p>With all variety of amazing ideas in my head, I mundanely skated on flat smooth
ground back to downtown.  Once I got there, I found a pack of guys on mountain
bikes, so I skated around with them a bit.  For about 2 blocks, I was able to 
maintain 17 miles per hour with one of them.  After that I let him pull me a
couple of blocks.  "It's good for your legs!" I told him after he complained 
about how hard it was.</p>

<p>We skated/biked down the steps at Alley Theater a few times.  The bike dudes
were doing bunny hops down them, trying to ride up them and lots of different 
variations of riding on the steps.</p>

<p>After that I stopped by Power Tools (skaters get in *free*!) for a bit.  
They had a live mexican-rock-rap band (whatever that means) and I didn't 
stay for long.  I stopped by the Plaza to watch the padless skaters on my 
way home.</p>

                        <p class=date>4 April 1996<p>

<p>Last Friday I went to Southside Skate Park and met Ed there.  That
was only the second time I had gone to do vert ramps and such.  The
first time I went, it was inline skaters only.  Friday there were
skaters, skate boarders, and lots of guys on bikes.  I noted that I
was easily the oldest person there, including Ed, as I found out that
he is like 1 month younger than I.</p>

<p>Anyway, there is a 9 foot tall half-pipe, and Ed was instructing a little
dude named Alex how to skate it.  Alex is probably 10.  I watched and then
went up the steps to the top of the ramp and realized I should probably
get warmed up a bit before I try it.  (I'm becoming wiser in my old age.)</p>

<p>So I went back down the steps and skated around the street course a bit.
It consists basically of some ramps at either end of the room, and a couple
of skateable obstacles in the middle: a hump, a rail, and another hump/rail.
I skated up one of the 6 foot ramps and proceeded to skate down and *SPLAT*
right on my same hip I always hit ****OWW!!***** <em>FUCK!</em>, I failed
to lean forward enough.  Groan, oh man, I could feel that my guts had just
galushed inside me, aaaoohhhh yuck..i..hate..that..feeling.  I got off the
ground immediately and fortunately didn't have to move too much to roll
over to the side.  I felt like crap.  I thought about going home, but I
just chilled for about 8 minutes and recovered mostly.</p>

<p>So I went to the less steep 6 foot ramp and skated up and down it with no
problem.  Cool.  I even dropped into the 4 foot half-pipe and had limited
problems.  Good. I'm ready for the 9 foot half pipe.  I clunked back up the
stairs and sat for a bit beside Ed.  After watching the apparently unbreakable
14 year olds for a second, I was ready.  "okay lean forward lean forward,"
I told myself as I skated to the edge of the 9 foot drop.  Forwaaarrd and
zoom*splat too far forward *crap*! I skinned my knee a bit even though
I had knee pads on.  I've got to get new pads.   Okayokayokay so I need
to practice a bit more.</p>

<p>I did the 4 foot half pipe several more times and then the first steep 6 foot
ramp on which I had first busted my hip, and had no worries on all these
excursions.  I fell several times, but not from like 6 or 9 feet in the air.
No problems.</p>

<p>So I went back to the 9 foot halfpipe and felt confident that I could skate
it.  I had done it before!  What's the big deal this time???  So I dropped
in to the 9 foot ramp and *Zoom* down *zoom* up and turn and zoom down</p>

<p>*crunch* I wrecked at the bottom.    Much better!  I went up to the top
again and *Zoom* down *crunch* I reached out to support myself as I fell and
strained my right shoulder.  OW.  ow owowowowowow.  Ow that hurt!</p>

<p>So I skated it again and again and after Alex was finished with his training,
Ed said to me, "come over to the mini-ramp we're going to straighten yourass
out."   Cool.  Ed is the best skater, and best instructor in Houston, so I'm
pleased.  I did it a couple of times and Ed told me I just need to relax more.
Just skate and flow with it.   Hmmm..</p>

<p>It was getting late, and I was bruised pretty badly on my hip.  Ed
had been skating solid for 9 hours.  As the whole place was closing, I
realized I lost my car key.  Doh!!  So we scoured the floor, but never
found it.  Fortunately, a guy in a garage across the street was pretty
handy with a slim jim.  Broke into my car and fortunately I did have
my ignition key.  Got home at about 11pm.</p>

                        <p class=date>1 April 1996 (no foolin!)</p>

<p>My two most recent skating adventures were this past Thursday and
Friday.  I've skated several times since I wrote Skating Adventure
Twelve, but I never typed them up.  So I'll pile several adventures
into one here.</p>

<p>Some weeks ago, we met at Fuzzies and decided somewhat arbitrarily
to skate to Transco Tower, which is probably about 10 miles from
Fuzzies.  Soon after we began our adventure, one of my skate wheels
died.  More specifically, the polyurethane ripped away from the
plastic hub.  I still had 7 wheels, so no problem.  However(!) by the
time we got to Transco Tower, and skated down its garage twice, I had
lost another wheel.  We skated a bit beyond the tower, and at our
furthest point from downtown, I was down to 5 wheels.  Yikes!  I lost
one more on the way back..  It sure seemed like a long skate ("please,
wheels, stay with me. please please") all the way back to Houston.  As
we were one (1) block away from Fuzzies, I was on 4 wheels, 2 on each
skate (we had to move them as they ripped off so that the missing
wheels were in the middle), and one of those began to rip off.  I won
the award of "Most Wheels Lost During One Night."</p>

<p>A different night, a group of us skated down the hill of "Coyote Park," 
so named for the bronze coyote statues around the water fountain/fall 
in the park.  Someone put a traffic cone on one of the coyotes as we
came in.   We skated fast down the hill, which is a fun challenge because
it is a sidewalk of miniature cobblestones, and they were a teeny bit 
wet.  That makes it *amazingly* easy to slide off, or otherwise lose
your footing and tumble (hopefully tumble on the grass).  I skated down
it again, faster than the first time.  I slid as I made the turn near the
bottom, but was able to control it and not wreck.  That was fun.   On the
way out of the park, someone put the traffic cone in the coyote's mouth,
making it look like a big megaphone.  That was funny.</p>

<p>For the past two or three Thursday nights, there has been a band playing
at Jones Plaza for "Party on the Plaza."  Lots of skaters and skate boarders
converge at the Plaza to talk and skate.  Some "grind" on the steps.
I saw Ed there this past Thursday.  He is arguably the absolute *best*
skater in Houston.  He and I wanted to do some fun skating, while the rest
of the group wanted to use up a $40 credit at a bar somewhere.  So Ed and
I skated around with Scott, who brought his frisbee.  We played frisbee
in a parking lot, making some pretty cool catches and throws (I could 
tell we were a bit out of practice) until Scott ripped his finger open
somehow.   We rested, and Scott left.  Ed and I went to UH Downtown
to skate the big hill there.</p>

<p>At the top of the hill I counted off 8 or 9 seconds and then we blazed down
to the bottom, where I easily passed a van that was waiting for the light.
Ed slowed down specifically and latched onto the van for a bit after it
got moving.  He threw himself forward as he and the van got near the next
intersection.  He just about flung himself into the path of a police car
as it crossed in front of us.  That would have been interesting.</p>

<p>We skated down 2 garages: First City and Luther's.  We almost got
kicked out of Luther's, so we went up the elevator an alternate
way..</p>

<p>We got to my car and hung out at Ed's for a while as he showed me
all his killer photos of him doing crazy awesome stuff on the half
pipes.  He convinced me (without much difficulty) to skate at the
skate park the next day.</p>
