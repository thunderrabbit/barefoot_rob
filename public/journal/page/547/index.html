                        <p class=date>8:52 am Thursday 10 May 2001</p>

<p>My car stalled on the way to my appoointment.  I
called him, and called work and now Wende is trying to
get a wrecker over here at no charge  via her
cellphone service  plan thing.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how long it will take, and I'm not
sure if I would rather just pay the $ to a different
wrecker, and even then, I wouldn't be sure they would
be faster to get here.</p>

<p>I'm  also not sure what is wrong with my dear
Scott.  He's got gas, oil and all the good liquids in
all the right places, but something else seems amiss. 
Namely, that he won't start.</p>

<p>Amidst all this un-knowing, I will chill and study
spanish.</p>

<p>Puedo relajar y estuidar espa√±ol.</p>

<p class=date>8:59 am</p>

<p>Wende just drove up.</p>

<p class=date>9:13 am</p>

<p>Wende's wrecker people said about 1.5 hours; I
called the wrecker suggested by Oak Forest (where we
will take Scott) and they said 1 hour.  So it's a race
and I'll call to cancel the loser.</p>

<p>Wende is going to rustle up some grub.</p>

<p class=date>9:37 am</p>

<p>Whew.</p>

<p>While Wende was rustling grub, a man walked up,
claiming he had mechanic experience and could help me
fix it.  He looked over the engine and announced that
I needed new battery cables.  He wiggled a cable and
asked me to start the engine.  It started with no
problem.</p>

<p>I believe he didn't do anything; the battery was
turning over the engine before; it just wouldn't
start, but I gave him the lion's share of my breakfast
anyway.</p>

<p>Called off the wreckers, drove about a mile and
Scott stalled.  This time he stalled while I was
stopped at an intersection.  Shit.</p>

<p>Put on my hazards and as the light was turning
yellow,  I pushed Scott across the intersection and
off to a side street.  Called the wrecker back and
Wende drove up behind me.</p>

<p>So now I'm chillin' in her truck writing to
you.</p>

<p class=date>9:53 am</p>

<p>Wrecker just pulled up.  I was writing a letter to
Bryn.</p>

<p class=date>10:36 am</p>

<p>Just dropped off Scott at Oak Forest.</p>

<p>Ironic:  this weekend I am scheduled to drive one
of our clients to NASA,  and now I might not be able
to do it.</p>

<p>Funny:  Before the car thing, Wende was all,
'promise me you'll vacuum Scott before you go to
NASA.'  Just now she was all, 'I hope you didn't do
this just to get out of vacuuming your car.'</p>

                        <p class=date>7:14am  Tuesday 8 May 2001</p>

<p>I really feel pissed and sad and all kinds of
shitty.  Last night I turned off the pager for my
I-group and I forgot to turn it back on.  We had a
super hilarious laughing awesome fun I-group, by the
way.  So while the pager was silent, I was getting
repeated 911-911-911 pages because our web server was
down.  From 7pm all night to now we have been
offline.</p>

<p>Kevin and Minh got in at 4am because we already
knew we would have a power outage at 4am.  They were
here to see how that went.  The power went out, the
power went on, no internet access.</p>

<p>We have a laptop with AOL access and did a
traceroute from AOL to us and the packets loop when
they get to the WAN side of our connection.  I don't
know if that's a problem with SAVVIS or with us, but I
called SAVVIS and the girl had to "escalate" the
ticket.  I hope that means it's on their side.</p>

<p>Anyway, we still have been down since 7pm on a
presumably unrelated issue: the shitty UPS that Dennis
"got a great deal on" fucking broke.  The shit is new,
like 5 months old and for no apparent reason, it died.
 I suggested that we go with <a
href="https://www.apcc.com">APC</a> because <a
href="https://www.apcc.com">APC</a> rules, but the crap
he bought obviously is a load of shit.</p>

<p>So two points of failure got us down at 7pm.  The
shitty UPS and me forgetting to turn the pager back
on.  Next time, I will put it on vibrate.</p>

<p>- - - - </p>

<p>Ironically, I can't send this journal to my website
without access.</p>

<p class=date>9:24am</p>

<p>Called Marcel who tried to help with getting the
console cable connection to the router working, but no
luck.</p>

<p>Called Duane, our local 3rd party smart guy who
listened the symptoms and thinks it's our T1 router. 
Possibly it got zapped last night during our lightning
storm.  I don't know if SAVVIS will fix the router
because we own it.  I am guessing we are screwed.   I
called Aslan, the cutie at SAVVIS who gets me the
hookup on stuff when shit is fucked up, and she said
that maybe the SAVVIS guys won't know that we own it
and will still fix it.</p>

<p>I called SAVVIS tech and it may be the case they
are fixing the router now, which would be wonderful
and ab-fabulous.  But right now we just have to "sit
tight[ly]." </p>

<p>Ack.</p>

<p class=date>11:21am</p>

<p>Dave is an idiot.</p>

<p>In other news, we are still stranded from the
Internet.  Still no word from SAVVIS, though I have
called them about 30 minutes ago.  I trust they are
working on it as diligently as they can.</p>

<p class=date>12:27pm</p>

<p>How can it be good in the grander scheme that we
are without service?  How can I relax?  How can I feel
like I am O.K. ??</p>

<p>I'm trying to do some actual work, but I'm having a
difficult time concentrating.  I keep wanting to just
melt into nothing and disappear, or to have everything
just be a dream.  But... it's not.  I'll even try to
fly to prove it.</p>

<p>Nope.  I jumped, but didn't fly.  It's not a
dream.</p>

<p>I'm in this state of crumminess where I don't know
how I can go on with my normal activities until I am
"punished" or fired or yelled at thoroughly.  I keep
berating myself and I realize that it's fucking
useless to do that, but I'm stuck in this negative
bullcrap.</p>

<p>I just tell myself there is nothing I can do about
it right now.  I have called a local Cisco Service
provider to see if we can get a new router.  Left a
message with them, so I don't feel that is actually
"complete."  I've called SAVVIS every 45 minutes or so
and they are still saying they're working on it.  I'm
working on writing some SAS to do email stuff, but as
I said, I'm not really focused.  Partially I'm not
focused because I don't know what I'm doing, and
partially it's because I'm not taking the time to
flowchart it out, but I'm not clear on how to
flowchart these details when it's datasets I'm
manipulating.  merge and set statements...  down in
some details of SAS.  Bluh.</p>

<p class=date>2:00pm</p>

<p>We're back online.  SAVVIS fixed the router; they
said it did not have an ethernet [something]
configured on it.  How could we have been working
before?  It's a mystery.  (hint: we couldn't, but who
cares because we are up)</p>

<p>- - - - - -</p>

<p class=date>8:53am next day (Wednesday 9 May
2001)</p>

<p>Dammit.  Last night I did not get the "9 o'clock
and all is well" page at 9 o'clock, but I didn't think
about it because I was actually here after 9 o'clock,
and all was well.  However, getting that page is
critical because it lets us know the system by which
we make sure all is well, is all well.  It wasn't all
well, though the rest was all well.  And when the web
server died at 3:15am, for reasons I haven't heard
yet, I did not get paged.</p>

the one tonight.</p>

<p>Impressive gusts and tremendous rain.  Not a lot of

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>Watching a show from the sidewalk being
performed at the top of a tall high rise building.  My
micropphone was in the eleveator listening to the
audio of the show, while my headphones were with me
and I was listening this way.</p>

<p class=dream>Madeline came up after the show and
asked if I could use my cellphone, but I told her it
was  up in the elevator.  Sorry, Madeline.</p>

<p class=dream>Amanda was also there saying HI after
the show; I don't know why.</p>

<p>- - -</p>

<p class=dream>I was  being asked to go on a trip for
work, but I hadn't gotten a chance to say bye to
Wende, and I was pretty upset abot this.  I didn't
feel at all ready for the trip, and I wasn't packed. 
Also,  I didn't have my swim  trunks.</p>

<p class=dream>Patrick was going as well, and he was
in a similar delimma.  We were about to put our stuff
in the trunk, but it was apparently already packed
full; our stuff would have to ride  on our laps.</p>

<p>-  -  -  -</p>

<p class=dream>Wallking outside I  saw the storefront
that  was featured on a flyer,  so I watched the
performance they were doing.  The management of this
store always had brilliant business plans, and right
now they were performing a musical outside their
store, starring the management of the store, wearing 
1940s  outfits..</p>

<p class=dream>I  kept walkiing and got to a chain
link fence, where on one side was me and a bunch of
people and o the other side was a different bunch of
people segregated racially, but I couldn't discern any
pattern.  Different colors of skin on  both sides  of
the fence.</p>

<p class=dream>I saw a friend of mine and put my hand
on the fence and he mirrored me so we were almost
connected.  Then I was all fuckit and climbed over the
 fence.  I felt all heavy, and wanted to be careful of
the sharpp parts on top of the fence, but then I
realized I was dreaming and floated  myself down
safely.</p>

<p class=dream>We  walked and he told me a story of
how when he and his girlfriend  first went out when
they were fifteen, people whispered, 'he slept with
her....' in a misinformed stereotyping way.</p>

<p class=dream>I was all, I would never make such
assumptions.</p>

<p class=dream>We walked along the street, and on the
right hand side was a ridiculously steep dirt cliff,
goiing down about 150 feet to some stores and houses
and a whole different part of the city below.</p>

<p class=dream>One girl  rode up the hill  and then on
the street level where we were for about 20 feet and
then back down the hill.  We watched over the edge  in
amazement as  she successfully navigated quickly and
safely down the rocky bumpy jutted hill with brush 
outcroppings down to the bottom and immediately sped
off as if it was nothing..</p>

<p class=dream>My friend's girlfriend yelled down to
the girl '10 seconds!!,' announcing to her how long it
had taken to make it  down, 'and 10 seconds left to
make it to your house!!'  They obviously knew each
other well; the bicycle girl presumably heard, but
didn't respond as she had to be home in 10 seconds. 
It looked like she was going to make it with plenty 
(3 seconds) of time to spare.</p>

<p>At first I told Wende I would not be able to eat
lunch with her because I'd be with youth group earlier
than normal.  But then I called SMom and determined
that I'd be able at least to drop off lunch for Wende
and then go meet them in the woodlands.</p>

<p>The sneaky thing about this lunch is that I got a
drink and an empty bag from Taco Bell, but I'll get
pizza from Star Pizza (the best pizza in Houston) and
put it in the Taco Bell bag!!  So sneaky I am!</p>

<p>Leaving the park now after playing 3-way Crazy
Ultimate and Sock Wars.  In Ultimate, Amy and I again
kicked the other teams' butts.  Speaking of butts, I
got a point by diving backwards into some sticker
bushes with berries, and now have two small but 
significant berry stains on the  back of my shorts. 
Uh oh.  Wende asked me not to wear them because they
were new.</p>

<p>Sock wars was fun, including a Jedi Knight who
could revive people.  A fun ersion of freeze tag. 
Played about 3 rounds of that.</p>

<p>I'm pretty tired and sweaty hot now.  Gotta go home
and get these berry stains out of my shorts before
they set, and before Wende finds out. ;-)</p>

<p>Oh I gotta write this.</p>

<p>I <em>just</em> called Philip Gayle after I emailed
him to see if he could help me learn Japanese.  His
reply was on the lines of "absolutely!  give me a
call"  instead of "um, yeah, um, but I'm busy busy"
which is what I expected.</p>

<p>He invited me to join him and group of Japanese
exchange students bowling this Thursday night, and
told me briefly about the origin of this bowling night
and mentioned that Alexis (that's <em>Alexis</em>) had
been there last week.</p>

<p>"Oh my gosh that's the best way to get me anywhere
is to say Alexis will be there!"</em>

<p>"Oh, you like Alexis?"</p>

<p>"Totally!  And I can't even explain it!  I could
never <em>date</em> her, but I just totally LOVE her!!
 She's so awesome and so cool!!"</em>

<p>"Yeah, she's just a great person, very forward
thinking and doing all sorts of great things.."</p>

<p>Philip continued, "oh, hey I just remembered I've
got another call on the other line, so I should
probably let you go.  And it's a call from
Japan..."</p>

<p>"Okay, see you Thursday!!"</p>

<p>So silly.  This will be fun as anything!</p>

<p>Went skating again to the Westheimer Street
Festival just to see Ed's team skate.   Amazing how
Bruce did his 900 degree spin, and Seth jumped on bike
<em>over</em> his brother on the launch ramp.</p>

<p>When they set up that jump, I was actually scared
for him, but he made it.  Amazing!!!  Really
amazing.</p>

<p>Said HI to Ed and stuff then cruised home and
watched Futurama.   Took a shower during King of The
Hill and then watched The Simpsons and they had
another Unitarian joke!!</p>

<p>Bart and Lisa at the preacher's ice cream stand
were offered 'unitarian ice cream.'</p>

<p>'The bowl is empty!' exclaimed Lisa.</p>

<p>'Exactly,' with I-told-you-so voice.</p>

<p>Hahahhaa!!!  I love when they have Unitarian jokes
on The Simpsons!!</p>

<p>Today on skates I visited the Westheimer Street
Festival, (held on Allen Parkway of course) and hung
out a bit with YRUU kids from Northwoods who just
happened to be there!</p>

<p>It was very cool - we arrived at exactly the same
time.  I was hauling down the hill from Taft to Allen
Parkway, and just as I hopped over the median, I heard
Hethre behind me.  'That's Rob!!'  Wow!!!!</p>

<p>I skated with them a bit, but mostly we were not
together except in spirit.</p>

<p>At the festival, most captivating for me was the
skate park setup.  A quarterpipe on each end and a
table top thing in the middle.  Aggressive skaters
doing some mad tricks - fakkies, 360s, 540s, and one
guy almost pulled a 900.  He tried about 4 times. 
(This was their third show of the day and they were
tired as shit).   AND!!  dudes on bikes doing 360s! 
So amazing.  One dude <em>got off his bike</em> in the
air and got back on before he landed.  He looked like
the ewok on Star Wars who stole one of the floating
speeder things.  Except he was more like standing in
the air while the bike was pushed forward.  Anyway, it
was  completely sweet.</p>

<p>My main man Ed Veiseh did a <em>back flip</em> on
skates over the table top ramp thing.  Three times. 
Maybe four..  Wow wow wow wow.  Gymnastics on
skates.</p>

<p>How great to see Ed at the festival!  Even more
amazing and incredibly great is the apparent success
in his life.  He's the leader/host/MC of a skate group
that tours the country going to schools and showing
youth responsible choices and all kinds of great
stuff.  So fabulous to see Ed completely doing what he
loves for a living!</p>

<p>This is Ed who I've know for a pretty long time as
an <em>incredible</em> skater.  I met him downtown
during my days of Wild Skating Adventures.  He saw me
bust my head open at Jones Hall.</p>

<p>Today I was wearing his kneepads that he
<em>made</em> while he worked for Pro Design several
years ago.  He wore them until he cracked one of the
plastic front protectors and gave them to me.  I've
totally loved them since.  These are 2+ inch thick
pads, and completely substantial for any kind of falls
I've made, even with a broken plastic front.</p>

<p>Anyway, so so great to see Ed and I must say a lot
of envy and almost shame that he is making a living
doing what he loves to do, and I'm not.  Of course,
I'm assuming he is making a comfortable living, but I
100% sure he loves skating, so at least that.</p>

<p>So awesome for him!</p>

<p>We talked a while and he introduced me to his
peeps.  I met Seth who broke 10 spokes landing hard on
his back wheel.  Wow.  I didn't see this; it was from
the previous show.  And he still did 360s (and a
540??) on his bike!  wow.</p>

<p>At around 6pm I headed home to shower and be a DJ
at KTRU tonight!</p>

<p class=date>9:05 pm Saturday 5 May 2001</p>

<p>I'm at KTRU  now, and have had a pretty quiet first
hour, but apparently have some listeners now.  Some
good requests.  No theme tonight, but just playing
random stuff that I've never heard of.  Often this
results in a great show, and occassionally this
results in me (or a listener) going 'oh my gosh I love
this song!!!!'</p>

<p class=note>(written after KTRU)</p>

<p>Erin came in about 9:50pm for her 10pm to 1am
shift.  She's a cutie!  She's been a DJ for two years,
but I had never preiously met her. </p>

<p>KTRU computer stuff:  though Erin has been a DJ for
 two years, she had never reviewed a CD  because she
didn't know how to use the library CD-checkout
computer.  I only know this because I was logging in
two CDs when she arrived.  She was all, 'great!  can
you show me how to use it?'</p>

<p>We now  do our set lists online.  You can pretty
much see what DJs are playing in realtime.  It's a bit
tricky when the songs are short for me to keep up with
typing them up, but certainly doable if I don't have a
million short songs in a row, or if I had a partner,
which I'm not asking for, I'm just saying.</p>

<p>ANYWAY, I logged myself off the computer and logged
Erin on, but I erroneously put 10am to 1am as her
shift time, so it thought she had to play 60 playlist
and 30 alternative tracks!!</p>

<p>"HAHAHAHA  good luck!"  I laughed.  But I fixed it.
 I must say I found myself taking care of her computer
stuff after learning that she hadn't learned the
library computer process.</p>

<p>This is ironic (?) because she described a story
about how the rugby team she plays with buy her meals
when they go out because 'she's a college student.' 
'They seem to think of me as their pet,' she
explained.</p>

<p>KTRU legal stuff:</p>

<p>I forgot to sign out on the log thing, and I forgot
to log the 'KTRU Houston' legal ID that I did say at
10pm.  Erin logged them both for me, and for that I am
quite thankful!  I remembered that I had forgotten as
I was  in my car, so I called her and she said she had
taken care of it.  Yay!!</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>got home and Wende had prepared the most incredible
meal for me!  She heated 4 fake chicken (*) nuggets
and some creamed corn for me.  So so yummy, and
exactly what I wanted to munch when I finished
KTRU.</p>

<p>(*) fake chicken = some veggie something that
tastes like chicken like everything else.</p>
