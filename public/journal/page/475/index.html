<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>I was meditatively removing was from a jar while
talking to Jennifer at Paint This!, but I was not really getting any
productive work done toward etting my butt out of Houston.</p>

<p class=dream>She was making plans for us to paint on Saturday, but I
was all, "I won't be here..."  It was disconcerting for a friend to
forget that little detail.</p>

<p class=dream>I hadn't made any plans for where to stay in Dallas,
nor did I have any money to stay anywhere.</p>

<p>woah.</p>

<p>Fred and I are at Dude and Veronica's now, watching Vanilla Sky.
It's weeeeiird.</p>

<p>Tom Cruise's character's face has been revealed and he's walking
behind his girlfriend now.  Talking to doctors now.</p>

<p>"However, there are many others who have not had the aesthetic
benifit of plastic surgery that you have."</p>

<p>This movie is wizack.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you in another life, when we are both cats."</p>

<p>Excellent.</p>

<p class=date>12:35am</p>

<p>Hmmm..  Interesting conclusion to <em>Vanilla Sky</em>, I
guess.  They are riding the elevator up now.</p>

<p class=date>12:39am</p>

<p>Dude noticed the Twin Towers in the background of this scene.</p>

<p class=date>12:48am</p>

<p>Somewhat reminded me of Matrix in its "what is reality?"
questioning, and Veronica said it reminded her of <em>Fight
Club</em>.</p>

<p class=date>1:54am</p>

<p>Somehow it has become nearly 2am.  Time for bed.</p>

<p>Tired, tired.</p>

<p>Really impressed with what Fred has done for the new journal look.
He wrote some bad ass regular expression parsing thing.  He found some
code to determine what day of the week was a certain day, and I simply
ripped the code from its modules and made a little program to run
it.</p>

<p>Fred incorporated it into his code.</p>

<p>Today Fred took a small box of my stuff (water fountain,
dictionary, sew perfect toy, CD jambox, candle holders (brass), tea
kettle, crystal bowl, 3 plates, picture frame) to The Guild Shop, and
then I took the collapsable desk, and red/blue chest of drawers
there.</p>

<p>Ate lunch with Kristen at Hobbit Cafe.  Attended I-group, where
they gave me big blessings and love.  Chris from I-group took me and
Robin out to dinner.  Picked up Fred and hung out at Dude's.  Now home
and going to bed.</p>

<p>oooh.</p>

<p>Tired.  Need to be at Ima and Eka's church in 1.25 hours.</p>

<p>Ima is the girl I met in sign language.  Eka is her twin sister.
They are funny; it should be fun.  I'm not sure what I'll wear.</p>

<p class=date>2:01pm</p>

<p>I wore pants and sandals and my red dragon-print shirt on top.  I
found the service to be long and boring.  Two hours long.  Lots of
enthusiasm and singing and clapping and happiness, but all that was
being said seemed strange to me.</p>

<p>I pretty much didn't believe the basic message of Jesus as savior
and such.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I noticed an interesting (paradox | double-standard | thing):</p>

<p>The bible story of David (who killed Goliath) sparing the life of
Saul(?) the king guy was described.  According to Brian (the preacher)
David thought, "how can I kill Saul?  even though he is bad, God put
him here as King, and who am I to question God?"</p>

<p>Okay, fine.</p>

<p>But then later in Brian's sermon, he summarized the story of Karl
Marx, saying that Marx saw his father being hypocritical toward
life|religion|bbusiness and Marx went off to create Communism and call
religion the opiate of the masses.</p>

<p>Then Brian went on to pooh-pooh Communism, saying it cause death and
suffering, etc.  Who is Brian to pooh-pooh Communism?  God allowed
Marx to create it, Stalin to embrace it; who is Brian to question God?</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I told Ima and Eka that I found the service too long and boring,
but that I was glad for the opportunity to come.  I chose not to join
them for lunch.  Ima introduced me to Brian, and I told him my basic
differing beliefs:</p>

<p>1) If God is all loving, then how can God reject someone?</p>
<p>2) If God is everywhere, then how can God reject someone?</p>

<p>He invited me to study the bible with him, and I said it was quite
unlikely that I would spend the time with him to do that, but that he
could email me, and I gave him my card.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>At the end, Ima invited me to study the bible on my own.  And I
thought to myself, "I invite you to study the Koran, or the I Ching,
or something else."  I didn't say it because I wanted to go see my
friends at Thoreau congregation down the street.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>The party at Thoreau was for Henry David Thoreau's 128th birthday,
which is cool because 128 can be expressed as 10000000 in binary.</p>

<p>I chatted with Charlie, Valerie, Inger, Meara, Meara's dad Joe,
Inger's mom Johanna, and Rhoda.  And ate some cake and watermelon and
cheese and crackers.  Gave out several copies of my card and described
the overview of my planned adventure to those who inquired.</p>

<p>Super thanks to all for the love and support!</p>

<p>Super thanks to Ellen for letting me barge in on her lunch with
Brad to use her phone so I could upload today's entries to my site.  I
had just given my website address to a bunch of parents and other
church type people, so I figured the recent KTRU entry beginning with
explitives would not necessarily be the optimal entry for them to see
first.</p>

<p>I moved online the entries written since then, but before this
one.</p>

<p>Yes, Tim, this is a case of me consciously aware that people are
reading, and not just writing whatever I want whenever I want.</p>

<p>Gave Ellen and Brad my yellow adventure cards and briefed them on
my plans.</p>

<p>Fred is at my apartment helping me redesign how my journal entries
are read.  I had a guess that he would involve regular expressions
somehow parsing something, but had no idea what he would parse with
them; I'm trying to read a bunch of files from a directory
structure.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>We were interrupted twice by phone calls, and were standing in the
kitchen drinking water when it was time to get back to work.  I asked,
"did you think of a way to do the directory indexing, taking into
consideration my criteria?"</p>

<p>Fred looked up at me, seriously considered the appropriate answer,
then replied, "huh?"</p>

<p>We both laughed a lot.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I was right; he suggested using regular expressions on a file that
we create the represents the directory structure.  Excellent.</p>

<p>So he set off to write the code to read the file, and I am going to
create a mock-up of the file.  "But first," he suggested, "music."</p>

<p>He looked through the CDs that I have allocated for him and
selected either Marilyn Manson or The Simpsons.  Excellent.  I
appreciate that we both equally appreciate such diverse styles.</p>

<p>Fred and I are at House of Pies right now.  He's coding perl.</p>

<p>Here's one of the regular expressions he used for the new journal
code:.</p>

<pre>$ls1r =~ m!^\./(\d\d\d\d/[^:]*?):\s*$(.*?\n\n)!smg</pre>

<p>I can pretty much understand it, but I couldn't have coded it.</p>

<p class=date>3:02am</p>

<p>At home now; I have to be up at 6:30.  Well, 7, but I'll be more
relaxed if I get up at 6:30.</p>

<p>Oh, on the way home, we encountered a water sprinkler spraying a
large volume of water in an arc into the street.  Traffic on Kirby was
minimal, so we stopped underneath it, rolled back and forth a bit like
it was a car wash.</p>

<p>Water hitting the roof sounded just like a mechanical car wash and
we laughed and hollered like little kids.  Fun stuff.</p>

<p>What do I want to do with all my rally shirts?</p>

<p>How can I choose to give some away and yet keep others?</p>

<p>Why don't I make a quilt out of all of them?</p>

<p>The ones that are my favorites I want both to wear and keep in good
condition.  The ones that are not my favorites I wish not to wear, and
I don't mind if they get beat up a little.  But wearing them is what
beats them up and doesn't keep them in good condition.</p>

<p>I just drove around the neighborhood where I believe Scott lives.
He's the man who loaned me his unicycle, for which I'm super
thankful.  I told him I would return it, but I've lost his contact
information, including his last name.</p>

<p>I remember we were able to skate to his house from Texas Art Supply
on Montrose, and I'm 100% sure I know which direction we went, and
what street we were on.  But I don't remember how far down we went,
although I'm 90% sure I know which direction we turned off that
street.  I don't think we made any other turns.</p>

<p>I'm 100% sure I know which side of the street his house was on.  It
was a house with a garage on the left hand side as viewed from the
street.  Hmmmmmm.</p>

<p>I did knock on one door, but it wasn't the right one, apparently.
It didn't match my brain 100%, but it was close enough to try.</p>

<p>I found <a
href="/cgi-local/journal.cgi?dir=2000/01/&file=20unicycling.html">this
entry</a> to be the closest to when I borrowed the unicycle, but no
details on how to contact him again.</p>
