<p>Today I rode my bike for about an hour on a bike trail near
campus.  The trail is not raw dirt as I suspected, but smooth asphalt
about 5 feet wide, with stop signs at street intersections and guard
rails along deep ditches.</p>

<p>The highlight of the ride was a railroad tressel above the bike
trail.  I hauled my bike through thick brush and briars up the hill to
the tracks.  Rode along the tracks across both tressels (one goes over
the bike trail, the other goes over a street) and it was pretty neat.
The um, the tressel over the street had a sign on it, something like
BUILT BY KING BRIDGES 1906.  The date is the only thing I remember for
certain.</p>

<p>I might not go to San Antonio Rally, for reasons that I choose not
to disclose at this moment, or ever maybe.  Well, maybe in ten
years.</p>

<p>I think it has nothing to do with some people who spoke to Steve
through Jennifer Nichols-Payne, and who spoke to me through Doug
Strong.  I do intend to be at Houston Rally.</p>

<p>I feel sad about not going.  Some youth have specifically asked
about me going and I've been saying yes, but now I might not be.</p>

<p>Poop.  I have trouble seeing the goldenness in this, which I trust
is part of all things in my life.  But I'm still looking and
trusting..</p>

<p class=date>10:10pm</p>

<p>Okay, I've decided I'm not going.  This decision gives me the
freedom to not worry about being back in time for the rally just to
find out that I cannot attend.</p>

<p>Makes sense to me.</p>

<p>Went to Madeleine's work, which is in a Presbyterian church near
OSU (I think).  She has basically created her job(s) in the world,
training public school bus drivers who have to drive long (150 miles
each way) routes on a daily (or more) basis, working toward prison
reform, training people in something else, and other stuff and lots of
peace activism.</p>

<p>Basically I checked email while she went to lunch, then she gave me
a tour of her work and the church.  It's big, old and nice.</p>

<p>I'm just now reading some of my emails, and found this hilarious
one from Cog, who has played Ultimate for many years at UH with
Saturday Night Specials</p>

<pre>
From: Cog
To:   SNS group
Subj: Disk Golf synopsis

Yall missed some great disk golf after Ultimate.

Only Steve and I were manly enough to play after 3 action packed games of
SNS Ultimate.

Meek realizing he was going to taunted and perhaps even double taunted
started laying full out on the grass between the last few points of
the third game.Ê It was not enough ... his manhood was challenged
afterwards in the name of disk golf.Ê His excuse was ... I have to
drive back to Austin tomorrow I don't want to be sore for that.Ê I
don't know how many times I have driven to Austin and have been
exhausted by the time I got there.Ê I usually pull over a few times
and put the car in drive and try and run beside it for as long as I
can.Ê Or other times I try to crawl from the front seat to the back
while maintaining the speed limit of the road.

Sean was even worse ... even thou he had no one to go home to.Ê He
claimed he was a real man and he had played real ultimate on the
previous Thursday.  He was too tired from Thursday night to walk
around for another 30 minutes.  I think we should change our name to
Saturday Night Woosies.

Steve and I ventured out into the dark all alone.Ê Into new
construction.  After 9 holes I had to borrow a limp wet dollar from
Steve for a drink.Ê It took me about 20 minutes to get the machine to
take it ... but I was not to be denied !Ê Ahhh Cran-Rasberry Ocean
Spray at hole 9 on the UH course at 2:00 AM.Ê It doesn't get any
better than that.

<p>D'oh!  (times three)</p>

<p>My computer lost its battery so the clock got reset.  Lemme fix
that..</p>

<p class=date>8:51am EDT Tuesday 8 October 2002</p>

<p>Okay, that's better.  (ironically emacs lost its mind when I reset
the time and it crashed)</p>

<p>I've left my sweat pants and hoodie in West Virginia.  And I'm
beginning to notice some cold weather around me.  I can replace them
relatively easily (but that was a really nice hoodie; I will ask them
to send it to me); I'll visit a thrift store today and see what I can
find.</p>

<p>But as I was preparing for my day, I find that my clear plastic
folder thing of my current notes/letters/things to do is missing!
D'oh!  I guess I left it in West Virginia as well.  I'll call them and
see if they can find it.</p>

<p>As I drove to Oberlin, Eminem kept me pretty effectively awake.  I
noticed that on my way to Columbus, I was all tired tired oh so tired
and then put the tape in and *bang* I was awake!   Then I got tired
again even with the tape on.</p>

<p>Same thing on the way to Oberlin.</p>

<p>The trip was short; 2 hours, and I had relatively no problem
finding Abbey's house.  She was actually outside about to play croquet
when I drove up!</p>

<p>Played croquet with Abbey, Rachel, Betina, and someone whose
name starts with L (I think!) but I can't remember her name...</p>

<p>I got around the course first, including an amazing lucky streak
from the back post through four wickets in one turn!  It was so
totally wow and lucky.  My ball turned to poison first and I tried to
kill Rachel and Abbey, but Rachel hit my ball and then knocked it
through a wicket, killing my poison ball.  Betina ended up winning the
game.  Only Abbey's ball didn't turn to poison, but she was darn
close.</p>

<p>Lorraine is her name!  (Abbey just got back from her usually boring
Environmental Policy class)</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>After croquet, we munched at Keep co-op, which was a new experience
for me (not Keep, but co-ops at all).  I met Grecian during dinner and
then chatted with Bret and Abbey a bit after dinner.</p>

<p class=date>10:19pm EDT Tuesday 8 October 2002</p>

<p>I'm feeling at home no matter where I go on my trip.  Why is
that?</p>

<p>Pete's Jokes per Minute ratio is pretty high.</p>

<p>"You'll see a restaurant that got closed down because a firetruck
ran into it..."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>"Hang around for five minutes and then leave [to meet Pete at

<p>"Actually I'll leave now and get lost for five minutes with your

<p>"Okay, you do whatever you want, and I'll be there at 11:30."</p>

<p>Lunch was great; we shares stories and joked about random stuff as
usual.  Pete paid for lunch; I'm thankful for that, and for such a
lovely fun time.  He gave me directions to his mom's work at the end
of lunch.</p>

<p>I heard Sarah and Barbie awake, getting Sarah ready for school.  I
realized I needed to tell Sarah bye, since I'll be gone before she
gets back from school.  I gave her a hug as she was headed out toward
the bus.  "I'll be leaving today while you're at school."</p>

<p>"Shoot.  Now I won't be able to play wif you when I get home."</p>

<p>"Yeah."  <em>Holy shit I cannot believe she took it that well.</em>
"Okay, have a good day at school, buddy."  I've been calling her buddy
a lot and can't really explain why.</p>

<p>I thought she would throw in my face that we hadn't taken another
walk that I promised.  I thought there would be much wailing and
gnashing of teeth.  Nope.  Only "shoot" and I'm thankful.</p>

<p>I think she'll be pretty much at least in high school when I see
her again.</p>

<p>Barbie is leading me to the Jiffy Lube in Barboursville, but first
a stop at the bank (no story), and now stopped at a full service gas
station.  No story here except that it's the first full service
station sign said "ALL CIGARETTE CARTONS STATE MINIMUM PRICE OR
LESS"</p>

<p>That's funny.</p>

<p>I'm with Barbie now after dropping off Scott at Jiffy Lube.
Anthony, the cat who remembered my car description after I had called
him and asked about a T-tech service (change the transmission fluid
without dropping the pan), came out and talked me through the details.
$26 for oil, $79 for T-tech.  Then the cat in the garage was all "it's
a standard."</p>

<p>"Oh, we can't do a T-tech on a standard."  The service we can do
there is blah blah blah and it costs $29."</p>

<p>Okay.  I expressed my concern that Buffy at Oak Forest had told me
that I ought not disturb the filings in the bottom of the transmission
cause if they're stirred up, that will start fucking up the gears and
such.  He said, "well there's a magnetic drain plug that will attract
all the filings to it so that shouldn't be a problem."  The cat in the
back office who was listening without interrupting nodded is head in a
way that said, <em>yes, that is the correct answer for that
concern.</em></p>

<p>"Excellent.  I'll trust you guys know what you're talking about
cause I obviously don't."</p>

<p>With the lowered price, I went ahead and added flush of radiator
since I'm almost due for that.  Yay Scott!</p>

<p>Oh shit.  Hilarious.  Guess where we are eating breakfast.</p>

<p>I'll give you a hint, it's not super healthy.</p>

<p>Tudor's Biscuit World</p>

<p>Nice.</p>

<p>Walked about 2 miles each way on the railroad tracks with
Elizabeth, discussing love/hate vs indifference, childhood scar
stories (she fell out of barn, I busted my head on skates), nature of
god and life on earth and karma and such.  Excellently worth the time
after 12:00 noon that I hoped to leave.  "More like noon than 5pm, but
the only thing that would keep me here is a long walk with anyone who
wants to go."  Woke up Elizabeth and we went.  She's awesomely
fun.</p>

<p>Walked with Cordie and Sarah to the pond where Sarah fished with a
bit of a lure stuck on a stick.  Didn't catch anything.</p>

<p>Hugs from peeps except Elizabeth when I left.  Barbie would not
watch me leave.  I heard Sarah crying in the background as I was
driving off and Elizabeth was all, "wait wait wait wait!  You have a
sock monkey!  I just bought materials to make a sock monkey."</p>

<p>Nice.</p>

<p>Thank you, West Virginia family.  I look forward to seeing you
again, but I don't know when that will be.</p>
