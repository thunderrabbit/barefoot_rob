<p>Ç±Ç± brought her English texts for me to peruse.  I liked 1 for
Å”Å›, but it was too advanced.  Correct style, though.  She had one of
idioms which ÇµÇÒ said he wanted.  Perfect.  We yammered mostly in
English today and traded funny advertisments.  Like the Nova Å§Ç≥Ç¨
listening to headphones and the headphones are on the correct part of
his head if he had human ears, but he's a rabbit, so his ears are way
up high.  He's doing some turntablism, and then someone's like, "hey;
where are your ears?"  and he goes, "oops" and gets embarassed.
That's some funny shit.</p>

<p>I told her about SEGA's commercials featuring Sonic the Hedgehog
turntabling at light speed.  "SONIC! ... Man, lay off da light
speed."</p>

<p>"My bad!"</p>

<p>Ç±Ç± showed me some restaurants around Ç´Å≠Ç» and we found a
bookstore that had the exact idiom book she had used.  Bang I bought
that for Shin, and then found a puzzle (two interlocking "rings"
(shaped more like bent paper clips)) that I could not solve in 10
minutes.  Bang I bought that for Fred.  (The other puzzles of
interlocking "rings" on display there I had solved in 30 seconds each,
but this one passed the test.)</p>

<p>I gotta go to Subway for my third possible student.</p>

<p>Tonight I've successfully not studied; I've sent a bunch of emails
and reduced the number of emails in my Inbox to 29.  It was over 100 a
few days ago.</p>

<p>I also played with Fred's puzzle for about an hour.   Still
couldn't solve it.  Excellent.  I hope he has at least as much fun
with it.</p>

<p>I'm gonna prepare my brain for tomorrow, maybe study, maybe not,
then sleeep.</p>

<p>ps: with the students I'll be privately tutoring, I should make
enough money for my daily expenses.  Awe.some.</p>

<p class=date>8:02am JST Tuesday 3 June 2003</p>

<p class=dream>I was in the passenger seat of my van as a friend of
mine was driving it.  I had been all, yeah, you can have the van; I
won't need it while I'm gone, and then after I had told him that, but
bfore I had actually given it to him, I remembered I had promised it
to Josephine. I was all like, "oh shit."  "Um, I just remembered
something" and I told him that I had already promised the van to
Josephine and that she would therefore get it, not him, and I wondered
about asking Josephine if he could use it just for one road trip and
*then* given it to her, but the issue remained; he had to not wreck it
while he was driving on the roadtrip, and insurance wouldn't cover it
if he wrecked cause it was still in my name, etc.  Eeek.</p>

<p class=dream>Then Jason Ficke was with us and we were stopped at
convenience store and some thugs were around us and Jason was flirting
with them like, "whoo whoo whoo! can't catch me!" kinda thing as he
was climbing out through the sunroof and then when a thug tried to get
Jason, Jason sidestepped and threw the thug headlong into the sunroof,
and he was therefore stuck, but didn't appear inside the vehicle; I
don't know where exactly he was stuck.</p>

<p class=dream>In retaliation, one of the thugs held Spot by his tail
and dangled him down through the sunroof and closed the sunroof on his
tail, but Spot was a remote control radio and shaped like a box with
an antennae, so It wasn't as painful as it could have been when I was
all, "drop him, <b>now</b>" and the guy dropped him by severing his
tail and Spot wouldn't move; I didn't know if he was okay, but he was
just a box, so I knew it wasn't the real Spot, but I was still a bit
shocked by it.</p>

<p class=dream>I escaped this situation by waking up.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class=dream>"Wouldn't it be weird if I woke up and this was all a
dream and I was actually still in Japan?"</p>

<p class=dream>I was back at home.  janette and I were hanging out and
cooking good American food and I was back at home.  We went on an
outdoor tour together and I had Spot with me.  We were riding on the
back of a pickup truck as it was being dragged along the ground. No
wheels. I had to hold Spot so he wouldn't jump off to explore the area
- it was too dangerous for him to safely explore..  Like it was a
jungle; he would have been zapped pretty quickly.</p>

<p class=dream>So I held onto Spot and we were moving along a trail
and some other people were having a picnic on the side. They were
also eco tourists and I was new to the group, but my group and their
group knew one another, though they were in different parts of the
group... Our group liked the sun and their group liked something
else, or was it the other way around? and someone in our group yelled
mock-taunting over to them, hey you don't like the sun!

<p class=dream>By that time in the trip we had stopped and Spot was
allowed to get off, as he seemed content to stay near our thing. and
eat cottage cheese that someone had dropped and I was being asked to
try some new food.  Like some kind of meat or something and it was
okay.</p>

<p class=dream>Then Spot was back on the truck with me and we were
being dragged to the end of the trek and then were back in janette's
living room. So great to be back home again.  What a wonderful
adventure, but I was was happy to be back at home.  Gosh, life sure is
great back at home.  Wouldn't it be weird if this were all a dream and
I was actually still in Japan?</p>

<p class=dream>"Yeah, that would be werid."</p>

<p>D'oh!</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class=dream>I was Eminem and being chased by bad guys.  I was mean,
since I was Eminem, so I had no problem killing people.  Well, it was
a bit tough to slam a guy's face into the corner of something,
especially when he was Lyle from my work, and was all, "I guess i'm
gonna die" in his Lyle way, so I let him live, but just be unconsious
so he wouldn't kill me.</p>

<p class=dream>Lyle had been Mike, and had come in with a 22 pistol
with six shots and when he shot at first, he couldn't see where he was
shooting so he didn't hit me.  I held up an ottoman and was going to
throw it at him, but then I realized he could see the ottoman and
would therefore know where I was, so I used it as a shield and when he
fired his remaining four shots, I caught them with the ottoman, almost
as cool as Neo in the Matrix.  I could just about see the bullets
coming at me.</p>

<p class=dream>I was going to jump outside, but there were bars on the
window and I couldn't break them down.  I was going to throw Lyle
through it, but he was too heavy, so I was going to jump through, but
I couldn't, so I had to sneak out into the hallway and hope they
didn't see it. Jon (who reminds me of my cousin Peter) was out there,
maybe with Jon Lo, and they didn't recognize I was the bad guy cause I
looked like Rob and they were looking for Eminem, but then I climbed
out another window, on the second floor and drop/floated down to a
ledge so I could be on the ground and get a password and be okay.  I
climbed off the house on Methil drive and was crawling back to the
back woods, hoping they would think I was a dog, and I got back to the
darkess where I was safe.</p>

<p>Last night I met with two new students. First was Å”Å› who I met in
ÇµÅ‘Å‚ by ÅÕÇøÇ±.  ÇµÅ‘Å‚ is pretty nutty.  Quite a diverse array
of styles and people.  Saw a young woman who was new to smoking
cigarettes.  She simultaneously looked nervous and like she was trying
to be cool.  Little tiny puffs she would take and blow them out
consciously.  And she would look down at it before she ashed, and when
she flicked it, the motion wasn't natural.  She crushed it out when it
was 2/3rds smoked, and then lit another 2 minutes later.</p>

<p>Another woman in cut-off shorts, heels, and a baggy shirt, with
long beige-blonde hair would approach people (all women, it seemed)
with a piece of paper or something.  She would quickly be dismissed
and then act like she didn't care, and size up the crowd before she
approached another.</p>

<p>Saw a huge video advertising <a
href="https://www.chiwawaworld.com/">www.chiwawaworld.com</a>, with
little cartoon chiuahuas with halos wildly driving race cars and
dying, or not dying, but wrecking a lot.</p>

<p>Two young men crouched hiding behind ÅÕÇøÇ± after they saw their
friend approaching.  He saw them and they acted like they hadn't been
hiding at all.</p>

<p>A woman walked up to me (wearing normal clothes) so I figured it
must be Å”Å›.  Yes.  Got a little bit lost walking around the station
to Starbucks (Å†Å‚Ç» had taken me through little hallways
<em>through</em> the station, and I knew better than to even attempt
that).  Å”Å› confirmed the whereabouts of the Ç∆ÇÊÅ≠ line, and I was
reoriented.</p>

<p>She expressed nervousness since she's not fluent in English and I
was all, "oh no worries; don't be nervous" etc which I hope helped
some.</p>

<p>Once we got to the Starbucks, she bought me a hot chocolate (yay!)
then we talk talk talked.  In Nova, she'd be about a level 7B, I
think.  My homework is to find a textbook for her to use.  Her
homework is to find a new location for us to meet.</p>

<p>She wants to meet for two hours each week for 5000 yen per week.  I
hope to help her exceed her expectations.</p>

<p>Commuter Express train to Ç´Å≠Ç» and arrived just three minutes
ahead of 8pm to meet ÇµÇÒ.  He's Korean, and about level 6 on Nova's
scale.  He wants more business English than Å”Å›.  He bought me dinner
at Jonathan's (a chain restaurant hybrid Denny's and Biraporettis
(sp?)).  He wants 1 hour per week at 2500 yen plus buying my dinner.
Awesome.</p>

<p>My homework is to to write some business-useful sentences and find
a restaurant for our meetings.  Jonathan's was too loud.</p>

<p>Japanese class was cool; Kimberly was across the table from me.
Slight distraction, but mostly I did well in Japanese until my brain
shut down after about 1.5 hours.</p>

<p>Olivia, Kimberly and I (and others?) might go to lunch after class
next Tuesday.</p>

<p>I slept diligently last night; woke up at 6:22 to pee, but went
back to bed until 8:50.  I had told myself, "self, you're going to
Lloyd's tomorrow to sign up for that money transfer thing."</p>

<p>Today was the big day and I thought eek that I've slept too late to
do it before work and I had the option of feeling all pooey at myself
and frantic to get it done so I would have done what I said, etc.</p>

<p>But instead of taking that option, I simply looked for Lloyd's on a
map.  Ah.  It's somewhat near Shibuya, a place I need to go tomorrow
to meet a student.  Perfect plan falls into place.  Of course I'll
just go tomorrow after my Japanese class.</p>

<p>Then the pieces fall into place around the plan like a perfect
puzzle:  *today* I'll make breakfast for myself, get ready for work,
on the way to work get a calendar to write in all the private students
I'll be getting, go to work.</p>

<p>*Tomorrow* I'll ride my bike to Japanese class, ride a bit further
down to Kikuna, take the Limited Express (fast) train to Naka-Meguro,
change trains and go to Lloyd's, go to Naka-Meguro and zip up to
Shibuya (very close), kick it and study around Shibuya (maybe call Dru
Daddy and invite him), then meet my student at Hachiko in Shibuya at
6pm, then meet my second student all the way back down at Kikuna,
where my bike will be waiting patiently.  Perfect plan.</p>
