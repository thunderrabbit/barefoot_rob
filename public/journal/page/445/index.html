<p>Nowel's!!!!!</p>

<p>It's here! It's here!  But the building is vacated; I can just make
out the name of where the letters *used* to be.  This is where Fred
and David and I walked to see the lobsters on that afternoon turned
night.  We were watching the lobsters possibly longer than we
understood because it was on the edge of getting dark when we left.
Something like that.</p>

<p>Anyway, the building is still here!  The business has moved to
Nifong and/or Keene St.  (The sign says CLOSED   PLEASE SHOP OUR
NIFONG & KEENE ST. STORES.  THANK YOU!,  so I don't know if they have
two stores on two different streets (at what address, please?) or one
set of stores at the corner of those streets.)</p>

<p>What I can't tell from the sign is if it's Nowell's or Nowel's,
because there is simply a block where the L(s) used to be.  I dunno if
it was a stylized Ll or what.</p>

<p>Okay, now I'm going to find Ridgeway and see if anyone
knows/remembers Mrs Fails or Mrs Schuppe.</p>

<p class=date>12:11pm</p>

<p>Ah.  Have just spoken with Lanny and Scott, chillin' in a truck in
the parking lot.  Scott comfirms that Nowell's is spelled with two l's.</p>

<p>Lanny has done body work on cars for 20 some years, but he's
looking to get out of it.  Possibly into computers, but doesn't know
where to start.  I invited him to email me for contacts.</p>

<p>Wow.  Guess, just guess who is the Principal of the school???  Mrs
Fales!  Sorry for all the years of misspelling your name in my mind.</p>

<p>She gave me a tour of the building, which looks remarkably the same
as it did back in the day.  The huge tree is missing from the
playground, and there is a small parking lot where there used to be
part of the playground, but the rest is the same.</p>

<p>Walking up the steps to the rooms in which I had 1st and 2nd grade
just blew me away.  Just the same.  Water fountains in the same place.
"That was the room where you were, and that was Mrs Schupp's room!"
(more misspellings in my mind) Just like I had left them all those
years ago.  How beautiful.</p>

<p>Mrs Fales showed me the library (not quite the same configuration
as I remember it) and where the music room is located (it was locked),
and the language lab (room had moved, but it was still downstairs)
where I had learned how to count to 12 in German, plus <em>guten
morgen</em> and <em>guten nacht</em> and some others that I didn't
learn well enough to remember now.</p>

<p>The cafeteria is in the same place but is <em>so small!</em> The
running joke for returning students: "we shrunk it while you were
gone."</p>

<p>Once I saw it, I remembered that the principal's office has a
window overlooking the cafeteria.  The lunch line is in the same place
but shorter than it used to be (lunches were 45 cents per day), and
the stage is in the same place.  Up on that stage we had a
presentation thing where we did penny drops off a highbar ("highbar
being a gymnastic term, not necessarily describing the height of the
bar") and a cake walk.</p>

<p>Mrs Fales reminded me of Mr Logan, the well-dressed playground
supervisor, who is still here and still well-dressed.  I haven't
gotten to see him today though.</p>

<p>I told her about the time we saw the Goodyear Blimp during recess
and crossed The Big Yellow Line, across which we were not allowed.
Had to sit out the rest of that recess in Mrs Schupp's room.</p>

<p>Mrs Schupp is teaching down somewhere else; I've forgotten what Mrs
Fales said, but they remain occasional contact.</p>

<p class=date>1:35pm</p>

<p>Some kid has just gotten in trouble and sent down to the
principal's office.  He's sitting silently in the seat next to me.</p>

<p>I'm about to roll out of here once Mrs Fales is done meeting with
whomever she converses now and I learn what is Ridgeway's website.</p>

Return to Columbia

Pulling onto Sunset Lane, I couldn't believe how narrow it was.  Not
even a line down the middle of the street.  I crept my car slowly
forward in the dark, looking for familiar shapes.

That's it!  That's the house!  I stopped for a moment to catch my
thoughts.  Several cars were parked out front, so I had to park in
front of the neighboring house. I could see the flickering glow of the
TV on inside, so at least I know they are awake.

I figure I must have carte blanche to just come knock on the door of a
stranger's house.

No doorbell.  I opened the screen door to knock.

A tall kid peers out the top window of the door, "who is it?"

I don't remember what I told him, but then when he opened the door I
said, "Hi.  I used to live here twenty-four years ago."

Amazingly, this was the family of the mom who bought the house from my
parents in 1978.  The mom was in the dining room, and she remembered
my name.

She had some questions that I couldn't answer, like when were certain
roooms added onto the house.  I wondered if my handprints were still
on the concrete slab in the basement where my dad's workbench used to
be.  She didn't know, but she said that's where her washer and dryer
are now.

She did know that Norma still lived across the street.

I walked across the street, knocked on the door.  A woman answered
by opening the door and peering out.

"Norma..?"

"Yes?"

"I'm Robert Nugen."

"What?"  She's apparently hard of hearing.

"I'M ROBert NUgen!"

"Oh my Lord," and she gave me a hug and whisked me inside.

We traded stories; I showed her a picture of my brother who was then
four years old.  She showed me a picture of Carolyn, who now has two
kids and lives up in Oregon.

She fed me two slices of leftover pizza and gave me the couch to
sleep.

- - - -

Next morning I explored the neighborhood during the day.  I spent
several minutes looking for the zipper I had thrown into the street
that was subsequently smashed permanently into the asphalt.  I didn't
find it, but I did see a couple of other items (penny, bottle cap) in
the asphalt that I imagined I do remember.

I walked down toward the creek and stopped short at Hillside Drive.
The hill was <em>so small</em>.  My brother and I used to sled down
this hill in the winters.  Me on the sled, and him on my back.  Wasn't
this hill well over 100 feet tall?  500 feet long?  Steeper than a
staircase?  Not anymore.

Turned right down Hillside Drive, and disappeared into the bushes at
Broadway.  The creek was *exactly* as I left it.  Same amount of
water, same rocks, same everything.  What a beautiful sight.  I walked
downstream (or in this case, downtrickle) about 100 feet, but was
blocked by that same deep section of water than vexed me many times as
an 8 year old.  I chose not to circumnavigate it by walking through
the neighboring back lawns.

Back upstream, through the tunnel underneath Broadway, everything
looked fine until I found a dam with a lake behind it!  When did this
appear?  Who authorized it?  What's going on here?

The staff at the nearby law offices didn't really know when it was
built, but guessed around 15 years ago.  Less than 24 years, in any
case.  Two other folks said around 10 years ago it had been built.
But the prairie of flowers seemed far grander than the small lake.

Up Broadway I walked to D&H and spoke with Brenda who seemed delighted
with my pilgramage.  She verified my memory that the front door of D&H
used to be on the east side of the building instead of the south, and
that the front counter was over there instead of here.

After D&H, I walked toward Nowell's to see if it was still there.  I
knew the walk well because my best friend David and I, plus my little
brother (age 4 at the time) had walked from our house to Nowell's to
see the lobsters in the tank.  We made it to the store with no
problem, but on the way back the sky got dark and stormy.  My brother
began to cry, which made me cry even though David said not to because
it might make him cry.  We were picked up by some of our neighbors in
the pouring rain after my parents had put out a neighborhood alert to
find us.

I feel so blessed at my timing.  The building is still there and I
could barely make out the non-weathered wall where the letters used to
say Nowell's with a big letter W in the middle.  Fantastic!  I peered
through the dusty windows to see medical equipment on the liquor side,
and where I thought the lobsters might have been on the grocery side.

One last adventure awaited me that day.  Ridgeway Elementary, where I
attended first and second grade with Mrs Fales and Mrs Schupp,
respectively.  Brenda had given me directions, so I walked directly
there with no problem.

Wow.  Ridgeway.  It's still here.  Not five times bigger like my high
school.  Not vanished like my preschool.  Just the same.  Only a
little bit of landscaping in front to greet me.

In the office I stood politely for a moment until acknowledged.  "May
I help you?"

"Um, probably.  I used to attend school here in 1977 and 1978."

"Do you remember your teachers' names?"

"Mrs Fales for first grade and Mrs Schupp for second."

"Well, Mrs Fales is now our principal..."

I didn't hear whatever else she said, but the woman I had seen through
the glass *did* look familiar, but I hadn't guessed it might be her!

Mrs Fales remembered me!  What a beautiful thing to be remembered
after so many years.  I told her I was in the midst of a road trip
around some of the eastern states after losing my job in Houston,
Texas.  "So I sold off most of my stuff, got rid of my apartment, and
I'm just driving around visiting friends and family."

Mrs Fales gave me a tour of the school, through several rooms I didn't
remember whatsoever, and then up the stairs to the classrooms that I
remembered so well.

Memories flooding into my mind as I ascended the steps to the rooms in
which I attended first and second grade just blew me away.  Water
fountains in the same place.  "That was the room where you were, and
that was Mrs Schupp's room!"  Mrs Fales nodded.  That's where I
learned to write my alphabet.  That's where I was the only kid in
class to spell "sure" correctly.  That's where I had to miss the rest
of recess after crossing The Big Yellow Line to watch the blimp fly
by.  That's where I remember seeing Nafi cry because some other kids
had called him Nafi Fafi.  (not me, I swear.)

Downstairs, the cafeteria was strikingly smaller than it had been when
I left it.  Mrs Fales tells many former students that they shrank the
school while we were gone.  This cafeteria taught me that 45 plus 45
is 90 because on some days I would forget my 45 cents worth of lunch
money and have to pay 90 cents the next day.

The playground behind the school is almost the same.  A small portion
of it is taken by parking, and the huge tree has passed on to tree
heaven.

Back in Mrs Fales office, she let me browse through the yearbooks,
the oldest of which were 1976-1977 and 1977-1978, exactly the two that
I wanted to see.

I photocopied the single page that includes my picture, David's
picture, and Melinda's picture (who I thought was so pretty that I
kissed her on the knee while we were all sitting on the floor to watch
a film strip).  Mrs Fales said that she had seen David recently, so I
looked him up in the phone book.</p>

I spoke with his mom and learned that he now lives in Arizona and
works as a chef.  What a wonderful revelation for me; I have already
been planning to visit the western states for my next road trip.

<p>I'm watching Comedy Central now.  Standup comedy.  Heehee.</p>

<p>Tamara just came home and offered to let me sleep on the bed in the
room behind her room.  Awesome.  Plus it has internet access so I can
read google news and livejournal.</p>

<p class=date>11:55pm</p>

<p>I just watched <em>Porn N Chicken</em>, Comedy Central's first
original movie.  Cute, and interesting that the main character's big
finale was to drive to California with no agenda.  Kinda like me?
Maybe, I guess.</p>

<p>Funny lyrics from song on the radio:</p>

<pre>
Scary like the bowels of hell
<em>BOO!</em>
Enough to make a black ghost turn pale..</pre>

<p class=date>1:36pm</p>

<p>I'm now on 55 south.  2770 miles total since Dallas.  152 miles to
go to St Louis.</p>

<p>Just saw a big monstrosity of a tank (like a huge medicine capsule,
not a military vehicle) being moved on a truck and trailers with a
buncha wheels like this:</p>

<pre>
         ______________________________________

 O    OOO   OOO            OO   OO        OOO

</pre>

<p>For an apparent total of 54 wheels.</p>

<p class=date>2:24pm</p>

<p>Stopped in a rest area now.  Been listening to a radio station with
nearly as much variety as KTRU, but they are playing popular songs
instead of unheard of songs.  I haven't heard any commercials in about
30 minutes, not even a station identification.  When I heard the DJs
(at the top of the hour?) they were as unprofessional as we were at
KTRU.  I wonder from where they are broadcasting.</p>

<p class=date>3:07pm</p>

<p>72 miles to St Louis.  2856 miles since Dallas.  I've been thinking
it would be really awesome to take a bicycle trip across the US.  I
have had hints of thoughts in my brain about doing that instead of
going to Japan.  Haven't decided if those hints are based more on fear
about going to Japan, or awesomeness about a bicycle trek.  Hmmmm.</p>

<p class=date>3:42pm</p>

<p>I just heard Abdominal with "Ill Culinary Behavior" which included
the line "Mr Dobalina Mr Bob Dobalina" (sp), which has been Phat Pat's
Silent Football name several times.  Wow!</p>

<p class=date>3:54pm</p>

<p>88.1fm in St Louis rules.  That's what I've been listening to.
Lots of heavy rap and some old Run-DMC ("Son of Byford" and "I'm Proud
to be Black" from Raising Hell) and lots of others that I don't
recognize.  Kris Kross "Jump" now.</p>

<p class=date>3:55pm</p>

<p>KDXH I think the DJ said.  This was the old school show, but it had
a cooler name that I didn't catch really.   KDHX</p>

<p>Oh man.  this song isn't hip hop at all.</p>

<p class=date>4:22pm</p>

<p>St Louis Arch is pretty cool.  Tall shiny triangular, overlooking
the river, saying HI to Illinois.</p>

<p class=date>4:32pm</p>

<p>At a gas station now getting gas for $1.499 per gallon.  Bargain
basement prices compared to Chicago!</p>

<p>95.5fm is my new favorite in St Louis.</p>

<p class=date>5:33pm</p>

<p>Basically just got out of St Louis traffic.  2969 miles since
Dallas.  20 miles to the next rest area.  Exit for Wentzville and
Hannibal 1 mile.</p>

<p class=date>5:48pm</p>

<p>2983 miles since Dallas.  I'm at the first rest area on 70 between
St Louis and Columbia.  Sun is about to be right in my eyeballs while
driving.</p>

<p class=date>6:07pm</p>

<p>Still at the same rest area.  I saw another first for me: automatic
sinks for a total washing experience.  Just put your hands into this
hole in the wall and first it automatically squirts soap out from the
back, then a stream of water a bit closer up to wash off, and then an
automatic air vent to dry the hands.  I had never previously seen an
automatic soap dispenser, and definitely had not seen a three way
combination platter like this.</p>

<p>The timing was a bit off for me.  I would enjoy more time to scrub
before the water comes on, and then a tad more water to rinse off.
The vent part was fine though.</p>

<p>Chillin' outside here at a table with a bit of something sticky on
it and some chow presumably for a small dog or big cat on the ground
beneath the table.  Birds twittering in a nearby tree, and most of the
trees around me are some shade of not green.  No firey reds or golden
yellows, but they're working on it.  Weather is mostly clear or thin
overcast and about 45 degrees with a slight wind toward the west.  I
can see the 3/4 moon looking over toward the east, and the sun is
basically set in the west.  Time to roll on.</p>

<p>70 some odd miles to Columbia I think.  I wonder where I will sleep
tonight.</p>

<p class=date>6:29pm</p>

<p>I'm actually pretty excited about seeing my old neighborhood.  What
will it be like?  I haven't seen it in 24 years.  M&M Mom has lived in
her house for longer than that so it's conceivable that some peeps
still would remember me in the neighborhood.  But *I* only remember
two neighbors that I haven't heard died since I've been there: Norma
Spencer who lived across the street with her daughter Carolyn who was
a bit younger than me I think, and a girl named Sydney who lived next
door to our left, oh and Billy who lived next door to our right.
Sydney and Billy were a bit older than me.  We shall see.  Less than
one our.</p>

<p>Passing a sign for Jonesburg now.  A Jonesboro cousin maybe.</p>

                        <p class=date>7:32pm CDT Thursday 17 October 2002</p>

<p>Okay, I'm in Columbia.  In a parking lot near a big street, which
is within a few streets of my street.</p>

<p class=date>7:36pm</p>

<p>Oh my god the fuckin' store is still there.. that's the drugstore
within 8-year-old walking distance of my house.  Now I've pulled onto
my street and it's so fucking small!  Is this my house?  I'm parked on
the street okay.. wow not even a fucking line down the center of the
street.  The most incredible thing will be if I can find a zipper in
the asphalt that I put here a long long ass time ago.</p>

<p class=date>8:30pm</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p class=date>8:54pm</p>

<p>I am exploding with overwhelming feelings of love and memories long
long forgotten and memories remembered and blessings of a couch and
pizza by Norma who has lived across the street since the beginning of
Time.</p>

<p>I first went to my old house and with trepedation, knocked on the
door, figuring that it was my God given right to knock on the door of
my childhood home.  The house is so small!  Is this the right house?
It must be.  It's dark so I couldn't see the street address.</p>

<p>Knocked on the door; tall kid looked through the window to see who
it was.  I don't know what I said when he asked who it was, but when
he opened the door I was all, "is this ________?" and gave the
address.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I used to live here 24 years ago."</p>

<p>He looked back into the dining room, ".... he used to live here..."
then turned back to me, "is your name Nugen?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, Rob Nugen.  Oh my gosh may I come in?"</p>

<p>The mom that bought the house back in the day still lives there.
She had 1 (one) kid (age 3) when she moved there in June 1978, and now
has four kids.  We traded stories a bit, including her wondering about
when rooms were added to the house (I have no idea, but I remember
helping remodel the kitchen, if by help I mean I sat inside the bottom
cabinet and read a book about the Puritans while my dad worked), and
me wondering if the apple tree was still in the back, and if the
concrete slab was still in the basement (with my name and handprints
on it).  She wasn't sure about either question (c'mon, either there's
an apple tree in your backyard or there isn't, but I can forgive her
not noticing a small handprint in the concrete in a dark basement)</p>

<p>I wanted to stay overnight in the neighborhood, but I didn't really
want to stay there because it was a quite smokey environment, but when
I left to go across the street to see if Norma was still awake (I was
informed she still lived there!), I said I might come back tomorrow or
tonight or I have no idea....</p>

<p class=date>9:05pm</p>

<p>So now I'm in Columbia, in the house across the street from my
home; my home away from home back in the day.  The street is only 5
paces wide, and the houses are so close together!  So small and so
close; I can hardly drive an inch without going past them all.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I walked across the street, knocked on the door.  A woman answered
by opening the door and peering out.</p>

<p>"Norma ________?"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"I'm Robert Nugen."</p>

<p>"What?"  She's apparently hard of hearing.</p>

<p>"I'M ROBert NUgen!"</p>

<p>"Oh my Lord," and she gave me a hug and whisked me inside.</p>

<p>This blessing is so fantastic.  I cannot have asked for better
situation arriving here.  I have just been given two pizza slices to
eat and a couch for sleep.  And Carolyn's address where she lives now
in Oregon (!!  so I can go see her when I see Dude!!) and it's all
just uber fantastic.</p>

<p>Things I didn't remember that I remember:
<ul>
<li>The wall hanging tapestry of The Last Supper that hangs in the
dining room.  It's about 6 x 8 feet</li>
<li>The lock on the inside of the front door.  It's like a chain lock
that will let the door open a bit, but not all the way, however the
chain is on a spring thing that winds it up when not in use.</li>
<li>they have a basement with door near the kitchen</li>
</ul>

<p>Only question mark in my head is what the two girls (age 28 or so)
who live here will think when they wake up in the AM to go to work.
We'll find out in the AM, eh?</p>

<p class=note>(dreams)</p>

<p class=dream>Up in a tree I was on the phone with a friend of my
ex-DJ partner, Donna who changed her shift from 7 to 10pm to 10 to
1am, but still did the 7 to 10 shift at times.  I was standing way up
in the trunk of this tree talking KTRU gossip with these people on the
phone, and trying not to fall down out of the tree as I kept slowly
rocking back and forth looking at the schedule of DJs written on the
trunk of the tree written really small, like printed right on the
bark.</p>

<p class=dream>I climbed down and said bye to them and began walking
along this beach with Matt on the west coast, actually on the beach,
walking with Mattboy, looking down at the sand and marveling how there
could be ant holes down into the sand, and these were ants from
Saharah Desert, but this beach was so exotic that we got to see them
on our collective adventure.</p>

<p class=dream>"I'm so glad to connect with you guys on your
adventure," I told him.  "If you hadn't come to California to see
Abbey then I wouldn't have and I wouldn't have gotten to see this
incredibly cool beach."</p>

<p class=dream>"Yeah, these ants are pretty awesome" said Matt, as we
started walking into thicker jungle.</p>

<p class=dream>We started walking up a hill of sorts, full of branches
and brambles and leaves. In this jungle area, like a pine tree jungle
with the forest dense all around us as we climbed up this hill.</p>

<p class=dream>We marveled that there could be so much stuff and
wildlife in one area and then started to see we had climbed up onto a
refuse pile of branches and leaves and pine needles and such, as we
started to lose our footing and step through branches and end up up to
our knees in this pile of discarded clippings.</p>

<p class=dream>The pile started to give way and Matt and I were
tumbling down it, I was worried about ending up broken or crushed
beneath this gargantuan pile of branches, but we just kept tumbling
down, always somehow staying on top of the pile, or within eyes view
of the top.  Mattboy was falling above me in the pile, like directly
above me and we were laughin at the craziness of this adventure and
sorta self directing the fall as we just rode this tumbling pile of
branches all the way to the ground.  There were some barrel type
things that we could ride in, which were far too big for us to use
like shoes as the large giant inhabitants of this island preferred to
do.</p>

<p class=dream>Matt and I were tumbling down and discovered these
barrels and we were kinda inside the barrels and sorta able to steer
them down and not get too terribly poked and stabbed by pine needles
and branches on the way down.  Or get crushed at the bottom.</p>

<p class=dream>So we made it down and were all exhilirated by our
tumble and adventure in general and kept walking out of the forest and
discovered we were in a race track for the large island
inhabitants.</p>

<p class=dream>I hoped that we hadn't messed up the track too much for
them, as we walked out of the gate of the fence surrounding the
track.</p>

<p class=date>1:55am</p>

<p>---------</p>

<p class=date>3:15am</p>

<p class=dream>Flopping around in bed with some of my friends like at
a slumber party, we were chatting randomly and I wondered with
wondered if kine means false in Japanese.</p>

<p class=dream>I was all, "stupdid stupid 2 o'clock in the morning, I
have to wait forever before I can play outside" while I was putting
shorts on then I walked over toward the other room to see if my
japanese instructor happened to be awake.  Her daughter was there
(Hannah from Memphis) and I asked her if her mom was awake.</p>

<p class=dream>"No, she's on a date with her boyfriend."</p>

<p class=dream>Then the actor from Dirty Dancing and Tango and Cash
walked in and asked the same question</p>

<p class=note>(the dream had been with me in first person now changed
to me watching)</p>

<p class=dream>He asked the sme question, and then Hannah was all,
"no, and her boyfriend could kick your ass in his sleep."</p>

<p class=dream>Guy said, "that's easy, I have 3 broken ribs and I need
to go you know what!"</p>

<p class=dream>So the next scene in this movie showed a close up of
tomato juice being poured out of a water house around a glass
cylinder.  Guy was breathing through the glass tube and the tomato
juice was being poured directly into his stomach too help loosen him
up a bit.</p>

<p class=dream>In this movie, the next scene showed a full view like
an X-ray view except it was in full color (a la <em>XXX</em>) and we
could see that the tomato juice had only been actually poured into his
stomach like a single ounce worth.  the water hose scene was just for
effect.</p>

<p class=dream>Next scene showed him as a news anchor, very seriously
relaying the news and then suddenly having to get up, with the
implication being that in about 2 seconds he would have to get up to
use the restroom.  The scene cut with him getting up during the news
suddenly and saying "excuse me.."</p>

<p class=date>3:26am</p>

<p>-----------</p>

<p class=date>???am</p>

<p class=dream>Driving along a highway that spiraled down slowly where
I needed to exit, but the exit ramp was blocked.  Cops were watching
to see that no one went down the exit, but I recognized I was dreaming
and jumped out of my car and ran along the exit and then jumped off
where the concrete ended abruptly in the air.</p>

<p class=dream>I flew well above the circular spiral of a highway and
looked for a way to fly down to the bottom where I needed to go.  The
spiral was so tight that the center of the spiral was only about 2
feet wide, and might be difficult for me to make it through.</p>

<p class=dream>I recognized that I could just punch through the
concrete with my feet, like just fly straight down to it in a standing
position so I did that and punched through a few levels of the
concrete spiral, then shifted toward the center of the spiral so it
was easier to just fly through it.</p>

<p>-----------</p>

<p class=date>6:42am</p>

<p class=dream>Hosting a party at my house, which was like multiple
rooms all connected in a line moreso than in a square.  Fred was on a
different schedule than me; he and his friends had been playing on the
computers, but now had gone off to eat somewhere even though I usually
went with them, but it was cool; I had other stuff to do.</p>

<p class=dream>One room was empty, and then I walked into the next
room and all these people from school (Maggie, Molly, Danielle,
Marcel, Kayse) with a bunch of other people were all chillin' and
talking about random whatevers all over the place.  I greeted
different people and thanked them for coming, and Danielle smiled and
turned her back toward me in a "you could give me a back massage if
you want" type of way.</p>

<p class=dream>I massaged her back some, but couldn't really do a good
job because she kept talking and laughing and tensing up her muscles,
so I quit and then she looked down at her leg and a spider had just
bitten her leg!</p>

<p class=dream>She was all "yeow!" and I brushed the spider off and it
ran over to some guy I didn't know, who was studying from a thick
textbook and the spider climbed onto his clean fuzzy light beige
boots.  I got a napkin and killed it so that we could identify it.</p>

<p class=dream>The spider was the shape of a daddy longlegs, but its
body was light green with about twenty tiny blue spots on it.  My dad
didn't think I could find any information on it, but I went over to
the computer and clicked on the first web browser that I saw (happened
to be Explorer) and he was all, "why'd you use Explorer?  Netscape is
better.."</p>

<p class=dream>"Because I'm in a hurry and any ol fuckin' web browser
will be fine to do a search on google."</p>

<p class=dream>The machine was being slow, so I clicked Alt-N to open
a new window (that's what it is on Macs), but it rebooted the
machine.  Doh!</p>

<p class=dream>So we went out of the loud room and into the quiet room
and got onto that computer, but someone had changed all the fonts so
each letter looked like a little marble (3-D and everything) on the
screen, with each different letter showing a different marble with a
different design, that (to me) looked nothing like the letter it
apparently represented.</p>

<p class=dream>I moved the mouse cursor to what looked like an image
of a lake where googles search box is ususally located, and typed the
marbles into the lake, where they floated around and performed the
search.</p>

<p class=dream>The whole concept was surprising to me and I woke up.</p>

<p>--------</p>

<p class=date>8:38am</p>

<p class=dream>Looking in the back of Scott as I was ready to leave,
lots of laundry in there.</p>

<p>Wow.  That's a lot more dream typing than I usually do.</p>

<p>Getting up now.  I'm leaving today, but I might do laundry first.
I will if I have more than 1 outfit dirty.</p>

<p class=date>10:41am</p>

<p>M&M Mom fed me breakfast after I showered and discovered the only
dirty laundry I had was that which I was wearing.  I haven't done
laundry since Kalamazooooo.... (13 oct)</p>

<p>I'm at Kinko's now, going to work on Kim's website a bit before I
roll out through St Louis (to see the arch, plus it's on the way) and
then to Columbia, Missouri, where I lived from 1 year old to 8 years
old.  (Back in my foolish youth when I counted years instead of
days)</p>

<p class=date>12:19pm</p>

<p>Okay, I'm going to roll out of here, after I get a snack of some
sort hopefully at a grocery store if I can find one.</p>

<p>I've gotten good stuff done on Kim's site.  Now my code will create
files, modify existing files, sort the files, hide files, restore
files.  And it almost certainly will work for multiple sets of files.
Now I just need to write the viewer for the users.</p>

<p>For some reason, I cannot get email to go out to addresses other
than my own.  Weird.</p>

<p>Fuck.</p>

<p>The cats at Illinois Cycle sell new rotors for $65.  My $40 doesn't
quite cover that.</p>

<p>I feel sad and wonder what is the lesson I get for blessing that
cabbie's life and letting him off with giving me $40.</p>

<p>The wheel is bent as well.  I'm hoping I can fix that without
buying a new wheel.</p>

<p>Sigh.</p>

<p>I'm going to shop around for a new rotor.  They say that no other
place around here will have it, and that I can expect to pay at least
$35 for a new one.</p>

<p class=date>2:40pm</p>

<p>Oh my gosh.  M&M Mom is going to buy me a new one.</p>

<p>I am so so so so thankful for that!</p>

<p class=date>4:40pm</p>

<p>My bike is at the shop (actually just the wheel) and I'm back at
Kinko's.</p>

<p>I took my bike's wheel to the bike shop; asked them to just unbend
it; I can replace the rotor. Visited Kinko's to work more on Kim's
website while they worked on the wheel.  Emailed M&M to get M&M's
Mom's phone number to give to Kinko's so they could call when the
repair was finished.</p>

<p>Still working on the website at 6:30pm, I knew the bike shop closed
at 7pm, so I called them, verified it was complete, went over to pick
up the wheel and the rotor.</p>

<p>Chatted a bit about bikes and Japan (told them an overview of my
adventure) and paid $85 for truing the wheel and the rotor.</p>

<p>Got back to M&M's Mom's house and the door was locked.  She thought
I had left.  What's worse: she had gotten a call from the bike shop
saying the bike was ready and cost $15, and since I had been gone so
long, she thought I skipped town with the $ she loaned me for the
wheel plus rotor (more than $15).</p>

<p>I was like <em>oh shit</em> in my mind cause of course I wouldn't
skip town on M&M's Mom; I have too much history with Maggie and Molly
to dis her like that.  She asked to see the receipt, but it was
written in light ink and small print so she couldn't read it.  I paid
her back the difference between what she had given me and the actual
cost of $85.</p>

<p>But now I'm in a weird space cause I also got $40 from that cabbie,
so I'm thinking I should give that to Mom, but *also*, my wheel is
still not truly fixed; it's still bent some and will cost like $65 to
replace, but *also* it's still round enough to roll and I'm not going
to fix it until it's way further gone than now.</p>

<p>I don't want to try to explain all that to Mom because I think it
will make me look like I'm trying to over-justify myself and
over-explain and not really be worth it.</p>

<p>Pooh.  Money is so stupid.</p>

<p>I will pay her the remainder when I have a job in Japan.</p>
