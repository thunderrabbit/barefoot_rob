<p><p>KTRU was so much fun tonight!!  Jesse, Jordan, Ryan were my three
trainees and they all did a great job and made some good errors and
got through and by the end of the night they all said they were having
a great time and feeling better about being at the controls and stuff.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m glad I came in from Tomball to do the shift.  Yay!</p>

<p><p>(This entry is speedy because we&rsquo;re about to go eat with my dad for
his birthday!)</p>

<p><p>At 7:40am, Will called while standing outside our house.  Wende gave him
instructions for coming in, disarming the alarm and feding the cats.  Thank
you so much Will!!!  I really value our friendship with Will and Molly,
Maggie and John.  they are so so great!</p>

<p><p>Funny:  Will was all, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s some kind of mess here; I&rsquo;ll clean it up.
I don&rsquo;t know what it is.&rdquo;  Wende was all, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s throwup; you don&rsquo;t have to
worry about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Will was very quick to say &ldquo;okay .&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Yeah - I&rsquo;m not one to wanna clean up throwup either.</p>

<p><p>It was weird to recognize that I had woken up within my dream but was
still dreaming.  I wonder how ofen I do that.</p>

<p><p class=date>3:49 pm</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;re in the middle of moving Karen&rsquo;s stuff to my dad&rsquo;s house.  I&rsquo;m not
sure how I feel about that; I described it to Wende as I feel invaded.  My
high school space.</p>

<p><p>We are hot and sweaty right now and Karen is reading upside down as I
type.  I wonder if she was able to read what I typed (she was reading upside
down)</p>

<p><p>Someone arrived 1 hour after Karen gave notice at the apartment her and
rented her apartment.  so she didn&rsquo;t have to pay the remaining 3 months of
her lease.  sweet sycnhronicity.</p>

<p><p>wende is hungry and we&rsquo;re talking about eating.  I&rsquo;m a bit wondring about
my KTRU shift; I don&rsquo;t know for sure if I have a sub.</p>

<p><p>Wende is helping my dad carry a small table downstairs.</p>

<p><p>We are sitting outside PF Changs waiting fifteen minutes until we are
seated.  At KTRU I only spoke on the air twice, both times at the beginning
of the shift.  The rest of the time I let the new DJs talk and cue up vinyl
and whatever.  I just gave them slight prompts &ldquo;how many playlist have we
done so far?&rdquo; and stuff like that.</p>

<p><p>Tons of fun and laughs!</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m actually sitting beside a guy who works here.  He&rsquo;s on the phone or
I&rsquo;d ask his name.  Short bleached blonde hair.  Tsk.  he just got up.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t have baby back ribs, but they have baby bok choy.&rdquo; heh heh.
I&rsquo;m so funny.</p>

<p><p>Madison called inviting me to see <em>The Exorcist</em> with her.  I left
a message back, &ldquo;um, I&rsquo;m not so sure about seeing that..&rdquo;  maybe maybe.</p>

<p><p class=date>10:19 pm</p>

<p><p>Inside now.  Interesting lights - big glowing circles with a spiral of
lights glowing above.  The spirals twist opposite directions for different
lights.  I wonder why.</p>

<p><p>Ew; my little appetizer plate isn&rsquo;t clean.</p>

<p><p class=date>11:28 pm</p>

<p><p>Gina, our waitress is extremely cute.  Wende said, &ldquo;Rob is soo in love.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Dad and I say the bok choy has no taste.  Wende and Karen say it tastes
like cabbage.</p>

<p><p>PF Chang&rsquo;s pretty much was great.  Gina, our exceptionally cute
waitress asked about my Visor just as I was typing how cute she is.  I
turned it off before I showed her.  I thought it would be in bad taste
to let her see proof that I was happy to sit at her table.  I was
already flirting enough.  I really appreciate Wende accepting my
smiles and falling for other women so easily.  She says simply, &ldquo;thank
you for not acting on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I considered a few different ways for Gina to learn the URL of my
site so she could maybe see my praises <em>after</em> we had left.  I
thought, &ldquo;if I only had some more business cards made&rdquo; and &ldquo;maybe I
could just write the URL on the check.&rdquo;  I chose not to do either of
those.</p>

<p><p>Now it&rsquo;s bedtime.</p>

<p class=date>7:20am CDT Friday 22 September 2000
<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was at Rice university sitting at a table in a lounge
type room, just chillin&rsquo; at a table.  I had my frisbee, my unicycle,
my schedule, and books.  I was wearing shoes. Talking to a woman who
was in one of my classes about how difficult chemistry was.  We were
about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> way through the semester, which ended in one month.  October
28 or so.  There were a couple of other people around agreeing about
how difficult chemistry was.  I had not yet attended the class, and
was debating between dropping it now and going to class full force and
catching up.  I had registered for the class thinking I could just
breeze through it and just take the final.</p>

<p><p class=dream>A woman walked in with a pile of shredded paper, but
actually each strand was a different equation of the class written
out.  They were cheat strips which she had collected.  With some
disgust at the pointlessness of it all, she threw them all into the
trash can, but my friend Jennifer was all, &ldquo;wait!  I&rsquo;ll take them.&rdquo;
And we began to dig them out of the trash can for her.  Like grabbing
big gobs of shredded paper and placing them on the table before her.
She was all, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just rewrite each one of these to help get them in
my mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>I started taking off my shoes, but asked her if we were
allowed to do so on campus.  I told her that at UH, I was barefoot
everywhere.  She was all, &ldquo;cool!&rdquo;  and started taking her shoes off as
well.  Before we got them off, or my question answered, a guy with
camera came in to get a pic of the group for the yearbook.  I asked
&ldquo;what&rsquo;s our sign?&rdquo;  meaning what&rsquo;s our hand sign (of this club). He
was all, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s this&rdquo; and showed me the rice university sign (hand
sideways in front of body, pinky and next two fingers bent, thumb and
next two fingers not bent.  (yes it requires 6 fingers))</p>

<p><p class=dream>We all displayed this sign not very enthusiastically
and he took the picture.  He commented on our anti enthusiasm, and I
thought to myself it&rsquo;s because we don&rsquo;t know each other yet!</p>

<p><p class=dream>Back to Jennifer talking, I told her that I had not yet
attended class, and I was examining the schedule to see what class
would be next if indeed I chose to attend.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Before I figured it out, she asked about my frisbee.
She asked if I played a game called 25(*). &ldquo;Yeah totally we play
ultimate just messin&rsquo; around.&rdquo;  25 was apparently a short variation
of ultimate.  She said her coach told her that she looked like she was
playing 20 because she wasn&rsquo;t playing hard enough.</p>

<p><p class=dream>She said that I probably should try to catch up in the
classes because then I would feel really great about myself if I catch
up.  Then a guy in a wheel chair behind me was looking at my unicycle.
He asked if I could ride it, and I&rsquo;m all &ldquo;yup, well pretty much.  I
ride it like ride-real-fast then slow.  ride-real-fast then slow.&rdquo;  He
laughed and I was thinking about how I could have more precisely said
&ldquo;I start slow and then accelerate until I&rsquo;m going too fast and then I
slow down again; I&rsquo;ve not found the happy medium yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Then I woke up.</p>

<p><p>As I wrote this entry, (right at the (*) above), I could hear the
<em>hunk hunk hunk</em> sound of Peter (our fat cat) about to throw
up.  Doh!  If he doesn&rsquo;t get fed on schedule, he hurls.  Basically his
life revolves around eating.</p>

                        <p><p class=date>6:48pm Friday 22 September 2000</p>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve used my cute little Handspring Visor.  I&rsquo;m
now at Hobby Airport, soon to meet Miss Wende, arriving at Gate 4 from
Dallas Love.</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;re going to Lyle Lovett concert tonight, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to
being with Wende, but not particularly looking forward to the concert.  But
Rocky said I might like it.</p>

<p><p>Work was ucky again today.  Again today I was super anti impressed with
Dave&rsquo;s code.  I found some errors in it - type-o kinda things and it was
just a mess of emails that people sent cause the shit wasn&rsquo;t working
correctly.</p>

<p><p>Kevin even cut his vacation short to patch stuff up, and I&rsquo;m really glad
for myself that I am here almost with Wende instead of there in the muck of
crappy code.</p>

<p><p>Kevin left on Wednesday, expecting to come back on Monday.  Little did he
know that he&rsquo;d be back on Friday late.</p>

<p><p class=date>8:28 pm</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;ve arrived in the parking area of the Woodlands Pavillion, and Wende
is changing clothes in the back of the truck.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Tonight,&rdquo; says Wende, &ldquo;I would just like to.. in the spirtit of
didn&rsquo;t-get-the-cats-fed, and kinda it&rsquo;s-all-just-little-details, I would
like to have the freedom to buy a shirt or a ten dollar pretzel or whatever
tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;okay,&rdquo; I say.   I&rsquo;m pretty sure she doesn&rsquo;t know I typed all that.</p>

<p><p>See, I forgot to feed the cats before picking up Wende and I pretty much
all &ldquo;DOH!!!&rdquo; about that.  I had planned to feed them between work and
getting Wende, but work was so stinky that I forgot.  I&rsquo;d like to blame
someone besides myslef.  but there is no blame.</p>

<p><p>sucks because we&rsquo;re going to my dad&rsquo;s house tonight and he lives close to
here, but we have to go waaay back home first.  We may or may not drive back
to my dad&rsquo;s tonight.</p>

<p><p class=date>9:08 pm</p>

<p><p>We have just now sat down by Elaine and her man in the lawn.  Had to walk
and get tickets and then stopped for water and nachos and a shirt.</p>

<p><p>Soon as we really sat down, he was all talking &ldquo;sometimes you can look at
people and tell things about them.. like you can tell when a couple has just
met, and you can tell when a couple has been married for a long time..
maybe you can look out here and see which part of the couple had the idea to
come out here tonigght and which part is just being supportive&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I cheered at that.</p>

<p><p class=date>10:30 pm</p>

<p><p>Just as I was about to write how bored I am, though some songs are
interesting I was all, &ldquo;ugh, let&rsquo;s go home.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>The cello guy just did a 2 or 3 minute cello solo that ruled.  oh wow
that was so fly.  That was my favorite part of the concert.</p>

<p><p>Now everyone is clapping (except me and it&rsquo;s some preachin&rsquo; song.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;If the preacher preaches long enough, even he&rsquo;ll get hungry too.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Oh, while I have this out, special thanks to Will who said he will feed
the cats tomorrow morning.  About feeding them tonight, Wende said, &ldquo;Peter
can stand to go hungry for one night.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>This may be the last song; he is thanking us for being a wonderful
audience.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Thanks to all my friend and family for being here.&rdquo;  (He had said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
kin to most of y&rsquo;all; thank you for coming out anyway.&ldquo;)</p>

<p><p>- - - - -</p>

<p><p>One of the gospel singers has a wow wow wow low deep voice.</p>

<p><p>They just did one encore and left the stage but Wende said she&rsquo;ll cry
great big tears if they don&rsquo;t play long tall texan.</p>

<p><p>No he came back.. now singing &ldquo;6 foot 7.&rdquo;  this has to be it.</p>

<p><p>No this is San Antonio Girl and Wende isn&rsquo;t ecstatic.</p>

<p><p>Please play it LL.</p>

<blockquote><p>(I am bummed that I didn't save an AIM chat between me an'
Rocky from today.  It was funny.

<p>I was all, guess who we're going to see tonight ?

<p>LL?

<p>OH MY GOSH YOU'RE RIGHT!!

<p>And then some crack about A and M and then "Have you ever heard of the
Chicken?" I asked Rocky.  "HAHAHAHA"

<p>I'm not even going to answer that.

<p>"The question should be" Rocky said, "How many times have you gotten
thrown out of the chicken?"

</blockquote>

<p><p>That&rsquo;s funny.</p>

<p><p class=date>10:51 pm</p>

<p><p>San An Girl song is over and now a fiddle song about trucks, but no Long
Tall Texan song.</p>

<p><p class=date>10:55 pm</p>

<p><p>kpft broadcast them on the radio.</p>

<p><p>now it&rsquo;s acapella with piano</p>

<p><p>maybe I can get a recording from them.</p>

<p><p>it&rsquo;s so hilarious how wende never reads my journal so I can tell all my
plans and she&rsquo;ll not find out until they happen.  and she won&rsquo;t be
disappointed if they don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p><p>anway, I haven&rsquo;t done the ring thing yet, but I do know her ring size
now.  I went to get one of Wende&rsquo;s rings this AM, but she had taken them
all.  She&rsquo;s a size 6.5.</p>

<p><p>audio just went screwy.  we lost audio in back speakers.</p>

<p><p>hmm</p>

<p><p class=date>10:59 pm</p>

<p><p>Show is finally over.    no long tall texan song.</p>

<p class=date>7:53am CDT Thursday 21 September 2000
<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was in the Methil neighborhood, and had a 4 gallon bottle of orange juice about 1 gallon full of water.  I was tossing it up in the air making it bounce on the street.  I couldn&rsquo;t break.  I was basically walking down the street toward the neighborhood pool, tossing the bottle up along the way.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Got to Landry Boulevard and gave a big toss to get the
bottle to land on the other side of the median.  It hit the top of the
bottle and cracked a little bit.  Leaked some water out.  I tossed it
again way forward and it almost landed right in front of two girls on
bicycles who had just turned around the corner coming my direction
riding bikes with their dad.  I cringed, hoping they wouldn&rsquo;t hit the
bottle and would be okay.</p>

<p><p class=dream>One girl watched the bottle and steered herself that
direction as she watched, barely grazed the back wheel of her sister&rsquo;s
bike.  She recovered and did not fall.  At the same time, the dad hit
his brakes and skidded on the bottle, crunching it.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was immediately all, &ldquo;oh my gosh I did not intend to
do that.!&rdquo;  All was okay though, and we all went to their house to
talk.</p>

<p><p class=dream>We got to know one another and they were cool; we were
cool and we became friends.  In his soliloquy about taking care of
ones self, he said that people need to be able to leave a conversation
or situation if the need to.</p>

<p><p class=dream>We inspected the bottle and could actually see the
scrape on the bottle where the car had skidded/slid on the bottle,
grinding the bottle into the pavement.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I recognized that I needed to go, so I
gave him a big hug and he quietly gave me blessings about w2hat a good
person I am and it was so great to meet me and stuff.  I disengaged
the hug and woke up.</p>

<p class=date>8:06am CDT Thursday 21 September 2000</p>

<p><p>Today is one of Wende&rsquo;s days off from Container Store.  This
evening she is being flown up to Dallas (their headquarters) for a
meeting.  I plan to go in to work now so I can leave a bit early to
take her to the airport.</p>

<p><p>Actually, right now I&rsquo;m going to go grab a ring from her case so I
can buy one the correct size for her as an engagement ring.  This week
I didn&rsquo;t put much more energy into finding back stage passes to Lyle
Lovett.  The concert is tomorrow night.  I actually don&rsquo;t have much
energy around presenting rings to her (I&rsquo;m back in my fears about it,
which is tossing excuses in my brain), but the vision was so vivid
last Monday that I&rsquo;m still going to do it.</p>

<p><p>Work was just crappy this morning to mid afternoon.  I felt a lot
of animosity toward Dave, whose code was just sucking crap everywhere.
Gaping typos and missed things in his code that he moved online.
Terrible!  It caused great turmoil for many of the users who couldn&rsquo;t
log in because the wrong URL was given in their email!  Lots of
problems when the name of a function-call was misspelled.  I mean,
<em>ack</em>.  I really was anti-impressed.</p>

<p><p>I was impressed with how well Karla stayed cool and didn&rsquo;t just get
totally frustrated like I probably would have.</p>

<p><p>Things mostly cooled down, but there are still some errors and
Kevin called from out of town and asked me to help Dave.  I&rsquo;ve offered
support but I rarely get a clear answer as to how I can help.
Partially I feel like I&rsquo;m being asked &ldquo;Rob, help your little brother.&rdquo;
I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;ugh!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>My code, of course, is perfect (yeah right), but it&rsquo;s working a
hellofalot better than this code.  I might go in tonight just to fuck
with it some more.</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>I dropped Wende off at the airport and on the way back there was a
wreck on the other side of the freeway.  We essentially missed getting
stuck by the wreck by a 15 minute time span.  (We drove by and it
happened within 15 minutes later.)  Traffic was way way backed up for
a few miles.  I&rsquo;m thankful that Wende got to the airport on time.</p>

<p><p>I felt <em>grrrr</em> and aggravated at Ultimate because I just
wasn&rsquo;t super able to run run run and the level of quality that I
wanted.  Vev (a really great fast player) heckled me at one point for
dropping the disk, &ldquo;Aww Wonder you gotta catch those!&rdquo;  It was a
really difficult catch. (45 degree tilted disk coming in quickly and
close to the ground.  I was not in line with its trajectory and had to
dive for it.)  I know he was just fuckin&rsquo; around, but I was already feeling not
up-to-snuff on my game.</p>

<p><p>What helped my mood was Kat enthusiastically &ldquo;Wonder!  Piggy back
ride!&rdquo;  And she leaped on my back for a quick spin spin spin.  She
rode piggy back on my two or three times in the night.  That was fun.</p>

<p><p>Oh!!!  On TV I saw the girl <em>totally</em> miss the vault and
land flatly on her back.  I commented about it to Steve, and he was
all, &ldquo;did you hear about the vault?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I <em>saw</em> it!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, did you hear that they had the vault set 2 inches too low?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Holy cow.  We wondered what they would do.  Re-compete the vault?
I imagine the coaches are going to try to sue the pants off of
someone, saying that their gymnast would have won the gold if only the
vault had been set correctly.  That is messed up.</p>
