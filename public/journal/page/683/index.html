<p class="date">2:35 AM Tuesday 30 November 1993 Day 67</p>

<p>&quot;Today&quot; I did SQL stuff &amp; looked for Cathy at SPB but I didn't find her.</p>

<p>SPB sponsored Catherine Wheel in concert in the Houston Room.  i was security, but only 30 or so
people came so I cruised to work on SQL.</p>

<p>I came back at the end of cleanup and helped take down the equipment.</p>

<p>I met Danny, the lighting guy who can throw a fucking fast overhand frisbee.  It is a fresh
maneuver.  I can't draw it right now so I will just have to remember it.</p>

<p>He &amp; I played disc out in the parking lot after the show &amp; everything.</p>

<p>I flirted with Janice, Rosa, Jeanine, &nbsp;Lisa on the way outside through OB on the way
home.</p>

<p>Got Tanya's &amp; my gymnastics routines printed and now we're all set.</p>

<p>I see my hands.  Therefore I am dreaming.</p>

<p class="date"><ins>2:35AM</ins> Monday 29 November 1993 [Day 66]</p>

<p>Friday I picked up dad from the airport and stayed overnight at his house.  Late Friday night
Fred came in and neither dad nor I had seen him in a while so that was cool.</p>

<p>Fred &amp; I played SILVER, a VGA bad ass pinball game for a couple hours.</p>

<p>Then he went to bed &amp; I stayed up till 5AM Saturday morning to beat Fred's score.</p>

<p>Saturday I mostly played around but I also rotated my tires to get my new tires on the front of
the car.  The one on the front right was in really shitty condition.  It's now my spare.</p>

<p>I went home Saturday night with _Journeys Out of the Body_ by Robert A. Monroe.  I read almost
half of it (instead of doing SQL) and I ended up quite scared out of my wits.  So I called Forest
&amp; talked to him for a while until I calmed down to sleep.</p>

<p>&quot;Today&quot; I woke up &amp; worked on SQL a teensy bit &amp; then I went to Molly's room
and worked more.</p>

<p>Then everyone but I left and I got some good work done on Automata.</p>

<p>Then Christine called &amp; said that she &amp; Suzanne had brought food to Social Work for me.
Excellent!  So I cruised over there to eat.</p>

<p>I played with them - tickle fought &amp; talked about Out of Body Experiences (OOBE) &amp;
Suzanne has done it once &amp; Christine has almost done it but she got scared.</p>

<p>I walked them to Suzanne's car &amp; flirted with them out there.  I was getting too horny for
Christine to keep me happy so I cruised.</p>

<p>I worked on SQL at Social Work till midnight when they closed.  I walked with Shama (originally
3rd Taub now 1st Taub) outside &amp; rode with her security escort to Taub.</p>

<p>Molly &amp; Sabita &amp; Will were outside checking out the lunar eclipse.</p>

<p>We watched then I cruised.</p>

<p>I went to Suzanne's &amp; explained my no sex rules &amp; stuff &amp; now here I am about to see
my hands therefore I am dreaming.</p>

<p>I see my hands - therefore I am dreaming.  I'm going to start working on having lucid dreams.  I
see my hands therefore I am dreaming.  I see my hands therefore I am dreaming.</p>

<p>&quot;Today&quot; I cooked Maggie's turkey and Molly came to hang out with me for a while.  I
did SQL for a while &amp; then Castle of Dreams.</p>

<p>Laura O didn't come to Maggie's with me.  Molly &amp; Will and John &amp; Maggie were together,
so I kinda paired up with Debbie.  I sat by her &amp; rubbed her and lay my head in her lap and
piggy backed her and everything.</p>

<p>Dinner was fantastic.  Turkey, gravy, rolls, broccoli, creamed corn, oyster casserole, cranberry
sauce, cauliflower, and pies.  Cool.</p>

<p>I read in Omni about a guy who can induce altered states of consciousness in people by using
sound.  The first state is mind awake / body asleep.</p>

<p>When I told Laura W in Chicago about it, she reminded me of lucid dreaming, which seems a likely
stepping stone to mind awake / body asleep  MABA heh.  or BAMA.  Cool.  I talked to her for about
an hour during which time Maggie &amp; John fell asleep on the couch.</p>

<p>Laura told me of a cool Windows based Usenet reader available via FTP.  I'll maybe try to snag
it.  It's a Trumpet software by NSCA (maybe) National Super Computing Association or NASC.
Something.</p>

<p>I woke Maggie up even though they looked so peaceful &amp; made me want a girlfriend.  Sigh.</p>

<p>I see my hands therefore I am dreaming.</p>

<p class="date">2:05 AM Thursday 25 November 1993 Thanksgiving Day 62</p>

<p>&quot;Today&quot; I cruised to EAG meeting at 11:30AM and Shenan sat beside me.  Cool.  I
rollerbladed to and from the meeting.  Jeanine came up and hugged me big during the meeting.</p>

<p>I got some munchies and said HI to Cathy at SPB.  I told her we need to get married after she
told me Reces Pieces are her favorite candy.  She said maybe in 10 years.</p>

<p>She agreed that Disney World will be a cool honeymoon.</p>

<p>I took her paper to SRII &amp; turned it in for her.</p>

<p>I cruised to Database and took the test, <del>though,</del> though not with flying colors or any
shit like that.</p>

<p>I <del>cra</del> cruised to the dorms and me &amp; Sachine (Marcel's roommate) went
rollerblading &amp; terrorized campus.  The best part was <del>cr</del> skating down in the parking
garage of the Hilton. It only has two levels though.</p>

<p>We played 'Lean Your Head Way Back &amp; Wath [sic] the Pipes on the Ceiling' That's a cool
game.</p>

<p>We skated in PGH, (1st, 3rd, 6th <del>)</del> floors) and AH (3rd, 6th &amp; Ground floors) Then
we rode the bus to lot 12 and the beautiful comp sci major Lisa (not Sabita's friend) rode &amp;
talked with us.  We played with the idea of her pulling us with her car, but she said nah 'cause
she didn't want to get a ticket.</p>

<p>Sachin &amp; I skate to McDonald's &amp; got water.  We couldn't get the drive through to
respond.</p>

<p>Cruised to the dorms &amp; then I drove to Party on the Plaza &amp; skated around.  Cops &amp;
stuff were setting up for the Foley's Thanksgiving Day Parade &quot;tomorrow.&quot;</p>

                        <p class=date>24 November 1993</p>

<p>On Wednesday before Thanksgiving, I went roller blading (what I
call terrorizing the city) for about 6 hours.  Major major fun.</p>

<p>I got busted (twice) for going into a pedestrian tunnel system that
connects Jones Hall with some parking lots.  The second time, six
security guards trapped us down there...  Crap!  They made us take off
our skates and go see the supervisor.  He just looked at us and said,
"Tsk. get them out of here." He meant to say, "don't waste my time;
they were just skating."  Heh.  So we went outside and cruised.</p>

<p>That group of skaters went to a bar, so I found another group and
we skated about 4 different parking garages.  First we did the "Exxon"
garage. (most garages are named by whatever prominent business is in
the bottom of the building.)  I had always wanted to do this one,
because it's a 6 level continuous spiral all the way down.  However,
this was the first night I had been with a group that knew how to get
into the building. We slipped by the little guard house, in which
there was a guard, but he was either sleeping or reading or didn't
care.  We hit the elevator up to the 6th floor and headed down the
ramp.</p>

<p>The entire 6 levels was a continuous slide-turn all the way down.
The thing is pretty steep for that tight of a turn, so there was no
use in trying to go faster, so we just cruised smoothly all the way
down it.</p>

<p>When we got to about the second level, we began to hear shouts of,
"Hey!  Stop!!  hey!!"  We never saw anyone by the time we rocketed out
into the street and bolted to about 2 blocks away.
<br>Cool.<p>

<p>After a few minutes, we were joking about, "Oh, here comes the
guard stumbling and panting: '<puff> <puff> I finally <puff> found you
kids.. <puff>' Yeah? bye!" and we would simply skate away.  Heh.</p>

<p>We then went to the "First City" garage and skated it twice without
incident. We decided that no guards were there because the garage
wasn't very fun anyway.</p>

<p>Then we cruised to "Jesus Saves."  The garage is so named for two
reasons. First, nearby is an *old* church (old for Houston, but not
old for, say, Europe) with a gaudy as anything sign at the top
that says, "Jesus Saves." The sign really ruins the effect of the
coolness of an old church.
<br>The other reason is that if you make it down this garage without
wiping out, Jesus saved you from oblivion. There is no other way about
it.</p>

<p>We skated into the building and found the elevators.  The garage
has 13 levels and only 6 ramps going down.  Do some quick math to
figure out that each ramp goes down *2* levels instead of 1.  Do some
quick physics and figure out that a skater will be going *fast* by the
time he or she gets to the bottom.</p>

<p>There is some more physics pertinent to the situation.  Cars going
up or down the ramps need plenty of friction on the actual sloped
part.  They don't need quite so much friction on the flat curve to get
to th next ramp.  For us on skates, it's the opposite.  We don't need
friction on the way down, but we would like some friction in order to
facilitate our turns.  For a week after it happened, I could show you
my knee which proves that although there is not sufficient friction on
the curves to keep one upright, there is sufficient friction to skin a
knee.  (It wasn't too bad, though.)  I fell on one curve on the way
down, and my knee pad took most of the skid, but it slid off my knee a
little bit.  Oh well.  I zipped down the rest of the levels and waited
until everyone else had come down.</p>

<p>After many high fives, we went to the elevators again.  Just as I
pressed the up button, a voice came from a speaker in the wall, "You
guys need to leave the garage now."  "Okay!  Thanks!  See ya!"  We
cruised.</p>

<p class="note">(actually continued from previous entry in Book Six, with no break in writing)

<p>I went down into the garage under Party on the Plaza with two little dudes and we got busted.
The cops made us take our skates off and walk out.</p>

<p>Then I was screwing around on PotP and going down the steps &amp; stuff and showing off when
groups of parade girls walked by.</p>

<p>I found another group and we cruised to the tunnel that links PotP garage &amp; stuff.  (This is
the tunnel we did when I first went skating.)  It seemed WAY smaller this time.  We got busted.
Shit.  We got all the way to the garage &amp; some cops were there so we bolted back the other
way.  They were telling us to stop but no way.  Then there were guards on the other side and they
got us.  Shit shit shit.  They recognized me and knew but I told them &quot;you said the
garage.&quot; &quot;I didn't even know these were linked...&quot;</p>

<p>5 or 6 guards escorted us to the supervisor dude and he said, &quot;Get them out of here.&quot;
So they just kicked us out and we cruised.  (Had to take our skates off again.)</p>

<p>The other skater dudes cruised so I was hanging out with 6 or 8 Greyhound buses were cruising by
being escorted by cops.  Cool.  So I skated alongside the buses and pretended I was being escorted
too.  I like to think that people on the bus noticed me.  Buses stopped &amp; hundreds &amp;
hundreds of girls poured out.  They all looked to be between 14 &amp; 18 years old.  They  were a
dance group from &quot;all over the place&quot; I talked to a girl with braces; there were a bunch
of them with braces.  I got pictures of them as they were practicing.  There were actually 2 groups
and I met one girl in the second group.  Her name is Gina and she's cute and blonde.</p>

<p>Now - the cheerleaders were UCA staff - the same ones that I met a long ass time ago in may.
There was Devincent &amp; Jim &amp; a dude and that was cool to check them out again.  I got
pictures of a girl being thrown about 40 feet into the air and a picture of 5 girls doing splits
way up in mid air (picture from behind) Cool cool cool.</p>

<p>I also got a picture of Gina's group when they all bent over &amp; all I could see were girls'
butts.  Cool.  I don't know if she is in the picture.</p>

<p>I talked to DeVincent &amp; Jim briefly afterward and they remembered me.  Cool.</p>

<p>I also met a little dude named Bill who will be in a double stunt.</p>

<p>Then I cruised over to where the floats were being set up.  I met Farrah, who will be driving the
first float of the parade.  (The big turkey  I also met a 13 year old cutie named Ann who has
braces.  her whole family is intimately involved with the floats &amp; stuff.  I talked to her
about her favorite float &amp; stuff.  She has braces.  Her favorite is the gorilla.  I took a
picture of it.</p>

<p>Then I found some more dudes and we went skating everywhere.</p>

<p>We did the Exxon garage which is the spiral across the street from YMCA, which I've been wanting
to do for a long time.  It was cool.  It's just a big long right turn slide all the way down.  I
did it without a problem.  We got yelled at on the way out but we cruised.</p>

<p>We did a garage near Passport Photos.  It's 6 stories tall and we just ran up the steps to do
it.  We did it twice.  It has really short steep inclines &amp; then long flat straight parts.  We
didn't get in trouble.</p>

<p>Then we cruised to Jesus Saves.  Dude.  I had never been so I was really glad to do it.  We
cruised into the elevator and people were like &quot;which level?&quot;  There are 13 levels.
Someone said &quot;5.&quot;  Someone said &quot;naw.&quot;  I said &quot;13.&quot;  We cruised to
level 13.  We search a moment for the ramp &amp; then we found it.  People were like pausing at the
top until one dude cruised &amp; so I cruised.</p>

<p>Each ramp goes down two stories.  The ramp part of the ramp has plenty of traction, and the turn
parts have much less traction but enough to scrape a knee as I found out once. It's a fresh garage.
We got to the bottom and were like dude.  Go again.  So we cruised to the elevators and a little
speaker in the wall announced, &quot;You all need to leave the garage.&quot; Dude.  So we
cruised.</p>

<p>We checked out some stuff near the Video Christmas Tree thing and that was cool.  Then we
cruised home.</p>

<p>There was a baster on my counter so I knew someone had been in my apartment.  Molly had left a
turkey in my refrigerator and a note saying Maggie will call me at 6AM to tell me what to do with
it.  Dude.</p>

<p>I showered &amp; here I am.</p>

<p class="date">3:05AM Wednesday 24 November 1993 (Day 61)</p>

<p>&quot;Today&quot; Maggie &amp; I took her car to Goodson Pontiac for a check up.</p>

<p>My car started making a thumping sound on the way to school.</p>

<p>Marcel was not in graphics.  Neither was my chair.  I grabbed one from a nearby classroom.</p>

<p>I was spotted by Christine T so I talked to her for a while.  Then I worked on SQL until
gymnastics.</p>

<p>In gymnastics, I spotted Laura in <del>handsta</del> cartwheels on the beam, and I caught her
several times, including once where I basically <del>hefted</del> held her over my shoulder. </p>

<p>Today <del>we</del> Graeme had the stabilometer for some experiment he was doing.  I did it
first and did pretty well.  You stand on the thing &amp; try to keep it balanced.  It was pretty
cool.  Kiesha did it for 18 out of 20 seconds.  That is bad ass.  Excellent.</p>

<p>Laura took Heather &amp; I to American Cafe and fed us.  That was great.  I enjoy being friends
with Laura.  Lisa &amp; Sandra (Law, Astronomy) &amp; JohnEdward were there.  I hugged the
girls. Laura got me a shitload of food.  Wonderful.</p>

<p><del>I tutored Heather Hea</del> For an hour I tutored Heather, who is doing excellent on
integration by substitution.  Cool.  I had an urge to kiss the shit out of her when we were
there. I <del>surpr</del> supressed [sic] it.</p>

<p>I cruised to VAX SQL for 7 hours or so.  Greg was an amazing great help with SQL.  With his help
I'll be able to get this shit done.  Cool.</p>

<p>Night.</p>

<p class="date">1:10 AM Tuesday 23 November 1993 (Day 60)</p>

<p>&quot;Today&quot; my car stalled on the I-10 feeder in the right turn lane to turn onto
Silber.</p>

<p>I alone pushed it around the corner &amp; up over the railroad tracks while barefoot.  It was
quite a challenge. It wouldn't start until I propped open the butterfly valve on the carburetor.</p>

<p>Maggie &amp; I watched the Simpsons that she had recorded.  I had seen it.</p>

<p>Automata sucked.</p>

<p>Today I wore long pants because I figured it would be cold.  It was beautiful sunny but it got
cold when it got dark.</p>

<p>EAG meeting with Stephen Barth was today.  I had never met him before.  We figured out how to
volunteer for buildings &amp; stuff, and brainstormed on what to do in the future.</p>

<p>After he cruised, Shenan requested a title within the group so she took Geoff's title of vice
president.  I got a title.  Now I'm the Recycling Chair of EAG.  Bad Ass.</p>

<p>At one point Shenan was talking &amp; I was getting up or something and she said, &quot;Sit
down,&quot; in a false grouchy voice.  So, I moved my chair right beside hers &amp; sat down right
beside her.  Touching her - shoulder to shoulder.  She smiled, &quot;smart ass.&quot;  At one point
as she was talking I flirtatiously banged my knee against hers &amp; she banged back.  Cool.  She
is really a babe.</p>

<p>I think I should try to be friends with her in the same way that I became friends with Laura
W.</p>

<p>Database sucked.. Near the end of lecture I woke up and someone had written WAKE UP really big
on my paper.  Heh.  I love it.</p>

<p>Lab was okay.  I flirted with Eva but I think she didn't take it as flirting, but just put up
with it as an annoyance.</p>

<p>I'm getting this SQL shit figured out.</p>

<p>Me, Molly, Maggie, Will, John &amp; Lisa ate at the Towers.  I had the guy blop a big blop of
sloppy joe meat on my pizza so I could smuggle it out.  That was a significant amount of extra
food.</p>

<p>Lisa had 3 bites off my ice cream bar.  yum.</p>

<p>At home I did some SQL Plus &amp; put some tables &amp; data in my thing.</p>

<p>I tutored Heather &amp; got 11 bucks.</p>

<p>I called Cathy &amp; chatted just for a bit.</p>

<p>Shama called &amp; I named an SQL hotel after her.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>

<p class="anger">10:55 PM Sunday 21 November 1993</p>

<p class="anger">Build it up now take it apart
<br />Climb up real high now fall down real far
<br />Wish there was something real
<br />wish there was something true
<br />wish there was something real
<br />in this world full of you.</p>

<p>That's enough of that.</p>

<p>I just got off the pone with Cathy.</p>

<p>She really thought about how she felt about me and she finds me quite handsome &amp; a great guy
but she is not ready for a relationship.  We talked bunches about stuff and I don't even remember
what.</p>

<p>We talked about past relationships &amp; why she's not ready for one now.</p>

<p>I somehow felt a sense of relief when she said no.  For the perfect girl, that should not
happen.  My committment [sic] to my perfect girl will be so perfectly desirable that it will be my
freedom.  Given the choice, I'll choose her.</p>

<p>Then she said that if I look for a girl then I won't find her.  I don't believe that <em>per
se</em>, but I think it's the watch pot syndrom [sic].  If I <del>wait</del> continually anticipate
something, it will seem to take longer to arrive than if I just let it come and not specifically
wait for it.</p>

<p>ANYway so I changed my message to myself.  Now it's &quot;STOP LOOKING&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So what do I do about my desire to kiss?&quot; I asked her.  She said,
&quot;either <del>surp</del> supress [sic] it, or go out with girls who are right for you now, instead of
looking for that perfect girl.&quot;</p>

<p>So there I have it.</p>

<p>So I <del>ask</del> told her I was very hypocritical:  &quot;I want to kiss you, then.&quot;  (I
had previously said something to the effect of the opposite.)  She aid it was quite tempting but
that</p>

<ol>
<li>she would want more (sex)</li>
<li>I have made my decision to not have sex</li>
<li>She doesn't want to drive herself crazy to uphold my decision against what she wants.</li>
</ol>

<p>Perfectly logical, dammit.  Shit shit shit</p>

<p>I told her that was quite logical and well thought out. Everything was cool and then at the very
end she got me.</p>

<p>&quot;It's just that the timing is wrong...&quot;</p>

<p class="anger">AAAUUUUUGGGGHHHHH!!!!!! FUCK The fucking timing which always bites my butt.</p>

<p class="anger">Shit.  So Nine inch Nails went on really loud and there <del>youg</del> you go.</p>

<p class="date">2:40 AM Saturday 20 November 1993 (Same Day 57)</p>

<p>I only remember barely answering &quot;I don't know (who I'm talking to)&quot; and then she
said, &quot;let me give you a hint: &lt;something&gt;, SKI Trip, ..&quot; I immediately woke up,
&quot;Cathy! How are you dear friend?&quot; She totally made my day by calling, and I told her
so.</p>

<p>She briefly told me about her day and her plans for tomorrow.  Oh she is wonderful.</p>

<p>She apologized for being brief with me at SPB, but I told her it was totally okay and I totally
understood.  She had to cruise to meet Linda and she was &quot;within 5 minutes&quot; of on time.
Very good.</p>

<p>Tomorrow she is getting up early to exercise and I told her I would be thinking of her.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm taking my dad to the airport.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where's he going?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know.  There's a joke: for all we know he stays at the airport all week.&quot;</p>

<p>I think she thought it was funny.  With that I let her go.  Oh Cathy is wonderful!</p>
