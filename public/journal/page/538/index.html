<p>I rode my bike from work to the bike shop during rush hour
traffic.  I mustly just hauled ass on the sidewalk beside traffic and
had no incidents except for one.  I zipped off a curb just as a truck
was turning left off the street onto the street I was crossing.  I
skidded, turned, and stopped in time, but I fell off my bike in the
process.  Bonked my left knee.</p>

<p>At the bike shop I picked up my light which simply had a wire
disconnected.  They fixed it for free.  I talked to Jeff who
encouraged me to bring the bike in for 30 day checkup on Sunday.  I'll
do that.  I've given it a pretty good thrashing.</p>

<p>Did I tell you I dented the back rim?  I did.  Flew off a curb and
the chain bounced so my pedals spun forward and I had no leverage to
jump up the next curb.  I lifted the front wheel up, but the back
wheel went <b><em>B O N K</em></b> against the curb.  It rides fine,
but is slightly dented.  They might be able to undent it.</p>

<p>I haven't done a whole heck of a lot of work today.
 I have gotten some stuff done:  I made the resend
password message use a template so it can be easily
updated, and I fixed a bug that would not allow the
username to be more than 8 characters long.  This bug
had never been found because all our usernames until
now had been exactly 8 characters long and the users
couldn't change them.  Minh is working on some stuff
that allows the user's names to be a product of their
real names like SMITHM or JOHANAVICHW.</p>

<p>I don't particularly approve of this system because
of cases like SMITHM.  Not that I know two people who
would have that username.</p>

<p>AND, I spent 2 hours surfing around after being
given a link to somethingawful.com.  And, wouldn'tcha
know, I was given the link by a mysterious person
known as M Smith.</p>

<p>Wende and I saw <em>Lara Croft - Tomb Raider</em> this afternoon.
Great action and cool disparate settings.  (This is why i'm not a
movie critic) ....  I can't really write more without giving away
stuff, and it's still a pretty new movie, right?</p>

<p>Wende asked me what I liked best - the exact ending of the movie.
Such intensity.</p>

<p>Wende liked the way she got to Tibet.</p>

<p>We stayed for the closing credits, but there were no hidden scenes
or outtakes, or anything interesting.</p>

<p>For me an' Wende's negative one year anniversary, I gave her the
ceramic dry-erase board that I wrote about in the !Secret! entry
above.  I had her open it with her eyes closed, and she was able to
determine what it was.  (because she had asked for it) She really
likes it.</p>

<p>I'm most impressed at the level of self control she exhibited as I
told her that I got her <em>something</em>, but wouldn't tell her what
it was.  For the last couple of days, I had been talking to her more
about it; I wanted her to open the gift more than she did!!</p>

<p>You know what?  For the past few days I've had a
craving to play a tremendous game of Silent
Football.</p>

<p>Not tremendous like huge with 75 people playing,
but tremendous like long, for hours and hours of
sleep-deprived-merriment.  It appears that SWUUSI will
be the first opportunity I'll get to have such a
game.</p>

<p>I keep thinking of Ryan M and what he had been
thinking as I was asked to halt his bad accent.  By
bad, I mean obnoxious more than bad.</p>

<p>Miss Pink Club Rocks expressed how Ryan's accent
made her want to hurl (I don't actually remember what
she said, but she wanted him to stop).  Hmmm.</p>

<p>What I didn't know at that moment, as I pondered an
appropriate sanction, was that Ryan was thinking,
"c'mon baby, bring it back; hook me up with the
funniest/best/innovative punishment ever."</p>

<p>"Mr Kisses must use a <em>different</em> accent
each time Mr Kisses speaks."</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>I'm so glad to have thought of the perfect
solution.  Or at least a darn funny one.  Ryan liked
it too.</p>

<p>I'm not sure why this pleases me so much.  But it
does.  And I just want more such Silent Football
insanity to laugh and play and prove that YRUU
rocks.</p>

<p>Soon.  Soon.  Coming soon to a cabin near you.</p>

<p>I'm pretty tired; I'll make this speedy.</p>

<p>When I left work today, I tried to ride my bike down the steps
inside the building.  I crashed slightly and hit the wall with my left
arm.  Normally, this would not be a problem.</p>

<p>However, the walls down the stairs at my work are covered with
sharp rocks.  Not razor sharp, but sharp like broken quartz sharp, and
when my arm scraped, it hurt.  Three little cuts about an inch long
each.  Looks like claw marks from a mad cat.</p>

<p>During this event I also broke the headlight on my bike.  I don't
know if I just broke the bulb or what, but it's not working.
Fortunately tomorrow is summer solstice, the longest daylight hours of
the year, and therefore the day I'll be least likely to need my
headlight.</p>

<p>Oh shit!  Tomorrow is summer solstice which means it's my brother's
birthday, but even more urgent is my mom's birthday is
<em>today!</em></p>

<p>Wende picked me up from work and we drove to 59 Diner.  The parking
lot was full, so we drove back to my work, parked, and walked over.  I
was embarassed to the earth that we hadn't walked in the first
place.</p>

<p>Dinner was yummy; I had frito pie; Wende had salad and pot pie, the
rest of which I will have today for lunch.</p>

<p>Our waitress reminded me of Amie (and her "twin" whose name I have
forgotten) the KTRU DJs who look relatively similar.  Our waitress
didn't look as much like them as they do, but some similarities were
there.</p>

<p>We came home and talked and then went to sleep.</p>

<p>Work has been pretty okay; I cleared a lot of crap
off my desk, and have been on a conference call with
one of our parnters about a new client that will be
using the G3.</p>

<p>This is all great and good, but it really seems to
slow me down in the overall production of G3 because I
don't have the tools built quite yet that will make
turning up a new project super duper simple.</p>

<p>It's pretty darn easy, but not simple.  Definitely
not trivial.</p>

<p>And I can't make it trivial if I have to keep
setting up new projects all the time.</p>

<p>But don't get me wrong; I'm *<em>glad</em>* the G3
is being well utilized.  I'm excited that everyone
loves it.  I just want more time to hang it within a
nice administrative framework so we can easily
manipulate shit in the thing.</p>

<p>I think I know one thing that I can write that will
make manipulation significantly easier.  I'm not sure
how to write a generalized version though.  Hmmm.</p>

<p>Last night at the end of my work day, we had a conference call with
our partners in Singapore.</p>

<p>The most incredible awesome great great great thing about the
conferenece call is that it was finally determined that using my G3
project the way it's designed will be the easiest for all parties
involved.  Awww yeah.  That is great news!</p>

<p>Spanish was fun tonight; we learned stem-changing verbs e->ie and 
o->ou.</p>

<p>poder -> puedo
<br>hacer -> hago
<br>almorzar -> almuerzo
<br>...</p>

<p>I can't think of any other right now, and that's pretty sad
considering hacer isn't one of them.  Oh well.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Rode my bike to work today, and to Amy's Ice Cream to say HI to my
long lost neighbor Suzanne, and then to Spanish, and then to home.  I
like tearing around on my bike.  It was a bit scary riding so fast on
relatively unlit and not necessarily smooth sidewalk along busy roads
like Shepherd and Richmond.  But a good adrenaline type scary.</p>

<p>I even road down the set of stairs down from the parking garage (at
Wende's inadvertant coaxing).  Wende was all, "<em>I</em> could ride
down stairs on my bike!"  So I did it.  Didn't wreck.  It was only
about 6 feet tall, but more than I've ridden down otherwise.  After I
did it she admitted that it was taller than any steps she's ridden
down.</p>
