<p>Okay, so my basic plan is to move all my images to b.robnugen.com and
hopefully be able to keep the existing links to
/?images/path/to/image.png working in my journal pages.</p>

<p>There are several old images on Flickr (which are still there! (oh so
happy thank you Flickr!!))&hellip; I plan to move them to b.robnugen.com as
well.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if I can easily handle redirecting old links to images,
but I guess if I can tell robnugen.com/image&hellip;. links to refresh to
b.robnugen.com/image&hellip;. that will solve it.</p>

<p>Thing is; I&rsquo;m not sure if/how Dreamhost&rsquo;s manipulation of www before
robnugen.com will interfere with my plan to snag &hellip;  well I guess I
can just look for www.robnugen.com/image OR robnugen.com/image and
point them both to b.robnugen.com/image</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll let
<a href="https://github.com/MattWilcox/Adaptive-Images">Adaptive-Images</a> deal
with serving images from that subdomain and then evvveryone will be
happy, including mobile users.</p>

<p>Headed in to sbstrm now to replace some images on the new Body and
Soul website.  Sho said there were more than he expected, but I expect
I can finish them all in 4 hours before I have to leave for Mutsumi&rsquo;s
lesson.</p>

<p>##6pm</p>

<p>5:55 pm suddenly arrived and I was like oh fuck and ran out the door
to go to the toy store on the way to Muchan&rsquo;s lesson.  It&rsquo;s Shibata&rsquo;s
last Tuesday there, so I definitely wanted to say bye and thanks to
her.</p>

<p>##23:40</p>

<p>They taunted me with a puzzle called Quatro Formagio (with the &ldquo;form&rdquo;
because the goal is to form a square pattern with wedge shapped
pieces).. I wasn&rsquo;t able to solve it in the time I had available.
Boooo.</p>

<p>Shibata emailed me tonight and was like, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s do language exchange
via email&rdquo; and &ldquo;I can tell you the answer to the puzzle&rdquo; hahahahah.
Definitely no to the puzzle hint; not sure about language exchange.</p>

<p>Actually I don&rsquo;t know if she&rsquo;ll be here, but one of my former students
at Nova contacted me on FB saying that she&rsquo;s in the Tuesday version of
my Thursday class with GG.  Well, I&rsquo;m teaching the Tuesday lesson
today at 12, so I may see her soon!  I don&rsquo;t honestly remember her
just from FB photo, but we&rsquo;ll see if some memories return after
actually chatting with her.</p>

<h2 id="13-09">13:09</h2>

<p>She didn&rsquo;t join.  :-(</p>

<p>But we had a fun lesson!  Basically asked and answered a few
questions, while correcting grammar and such.</p>

<p>Finished lesson; &lsquo;twas fine and interesting topic about Paul Allen&rsquo;s
team recently finding Battleship Musashi.</p>

<p>Finished the lesson and outside the station I saw two women looking at
the local area map.  I wasn&rsquo;t able to help them as quickly as they
helped themselves (by finding their target on the map before I did)
but I was most depressed that I don&rsquo;t know French.</p>

<p>Workin&rsquo; late with Sho on a new site for Body and Soul; they put on an
event each year in May so we&rsquo;re prepping for the announcement.</p>

<p>I put their original site in a git repo and have their banner page on
the master branch, but edits to the new site were started from a few
commits back.  Blarg.  I agree with my decisison to start edits from a
few commits back, but maybe I should have two &ldquo;master&rdquo; branches: one
master-banner and one master-site, or something.  Then each master
would have far fewer changes and no weird merges required.</p>

<p>I might abandon the existing master branch and just pretend it&rsquo;s not
there and move forward with two master-_____ branches plan.</p>

<p>I evaluated <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/">Unreal Engine</a> now that
it&rsquo;s free and its pricing model is quite nice!  They require no
payment until we start making money consistently.</p>

<p>However, the dearth of assets and such impels me to stay with [Unity3D]().</p>

<p>right now I&rsquo;m doing this little
<a href="https://noobtuts.com/unity/2d-pong-game">pong tutorial</a> which is
geared toward Unity3D version 5.</p>

<p>Code is done and on github, but no live version (yet???) <a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/unity-pong-via-noob-tuts">pong via noobtuts</a></p>

<p class="dream">
Travis and I were in a virtual reality on my computer.  He showed me a
room that was similar to what I had seen before, so I almost didn't go
inside to explore.  Then I was like, "wait if Travis showed me this,
it must be cool" so I went inside to check the place out.  It was
*amazing* with 3D virtual games inside the groom, a hologram which
could be manipulated by touching the screen and project into the room;
and some hidden rooms behind the walls with hinged doors on mirrors
that caused the hologram to reflect "infinitely" back and forth; it
was so realistic that I made a joke "the Matrix is everywhere".
</p>

<p class="dream">
I found a super hidden corner which even Travis hadn't heard about
while reading people's logs about exploring the place; it was hidden
behind an inflatable statue and in between the statue and the wall was
a panel that could be opened and revealed a mirror hinged between a
panel hinged between a mirror and the mirrors were offset from each
other so I wondered how they functioned while hinged like that.  I
pulled the device out and showed Travis but he said he hadn't seen it
before.  Wow. I was one of the first people on the internet to find
this part of this virtual room!  Travis said he had to get going and
was glad that I had enjoyed the place.  Most def!  So we started to
lock up everything the way we had found it and one door was unable
to lock because its adjoining latch was on a frame that had been bent
so that the door coudln't reach it anymrore. I guessed we had to leave
that part open.
</p>

<p class="dream">
I saw that Travis had picked up a lot of broken glass to clean up the
place and I got a trtansmission from Marcel who was like, "dude are
you still there?" cause he had read my journal entry about it and
wanted to see the place as well, so he beamed over and I was like,
"Duuuuude!" and he was like "Duuuuuude!!" and I introduced Travis
and Marcel and then they were talking for a bit but Travis had to go
so Marcel was talking to me to see the new thing I had found.  I
told him I forgot to take pictures and he was like, "aw man I knew
I should have contacted you sooner!"
</p>

<p class="dream">
I stepped over a virtual tar pit  and started to wake up.

<p>I just came across a beautiful solution to resizing images on my
site.  It allows me to keep my existing images&rsquo; filenames, and it just
works as a drop-in solution.  A single PHP file (plus a few lines of
.htaccess to point images through it).  The resulting image URLs are
unchanged, but the size of the image is adapted per the device size.</p>

<p>90% chance I will send some btc to the developer</p>

<p>50% chance I will start putting my images on a site that uses this new
tech.</p>

<p>20% chance I will dig through some of the modifications in the <em>many</em>
forks and pull some of them in.</p>

<p>But right now it&rsquo;s shower + bedtime.</p>
