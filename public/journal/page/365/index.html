<p>Just studied verbs with Ayana.  Now I can say I'm going to Nova at
11:30 today.  kyounojyouichihamNovaOikimas.</p>

<p>One silly thing about Japanese is they don't split things up into
words.  It's just yammeryammeryammerallstrungtogetherlikethis.  At
least there are sentence breaks.</p>

<p>And I can say I went to sleep at 1am last night.
Kinohiyoichijininemashta. And other things that are not 100% clear in
my head.</p>

<p>Today I'll be working at what we call KQ.  It's the satellite
school of Kawasaki Nova.  I'm not sure what Q stands for, but I'm
pretty sure the K is for Kawasaki.</p>

<p>The school is not yet open; I'm going to study while I eat.</p>

<p class=date>9:16pm</p>

<p>Man, KQ stands for eazy breazy; this was a relaxing day.  Plus I
had the most hilarious lesson *ever*!!  These three women were 7Cs but
they were so outrageously hilarious!  I told the the game called
"Sausages" and...God I don't even remember; they were just
hilarious.</p>

<p>To kick off the lesson, one of them took my picture with a little
Polaroid camera which she uses to remember her instructors....</p>

<p>What a lesson.  What a day.  Nice nice nice.</p>

<br>interesting reading on the find a teacher website. (interesting ,like , really. not like, there were alot of interesting things in her space.)  <br>
  i noticed that the sample lessons seemed to have a global attitude.  for instance, the world no tobacco day(wntd) and international celebration of family day and some countries&rsquo; compulsory vaccinations:infraction of freedom?  <br>
    so nova has become your schoooool to teach you how to teach schoooool.  coooool.<br>

<p>I'm feeling much better this morning than I did last night.  It
just came as such a shock and I was tired.  I yammered with janette on
the way home - actually I ranted pretty hardcore to her on the phone.
She listened well.</p>

<p>I'm beginning to untie my tongue and just speak without too much
thinking.  My most recent dream included me asking Clayton how to say
something like, "may I check out a movie?" and I just repeated
whatever I thought he said; didn't worry about knowing exactly each
syllable - was it ko or go; was it ti or di - who cares just blurt
something.  Fuckit if it's wrong.</p>

<p>This is wisdom I originally heard from me-an-Wende's Spanish
instructor, and most recently from Chesleigh:</p>

<pre>
He kept telling me to LET GO; to not care about a sentence being
perfect.  He told me that learning a second (or third or ninth..) is
more like learning an art or a sport.  "It is not like learning
algebra."  He thinks that it all happens between the sub and
unconscious and that it will just naturally flow for you once you
learn how to not be stressed by it.
</pre>

<p>With my journal I'm beginning to do the same thing; write what I
want, let my stream of consciousness jump where it wants; let go.</p>

<p>Last night I decided to write an English version of the document
the cops gave me the first time my bike got stolen.  Actually I
decided to write a paper that talks about how not to get one's bike
towed in the first place.  I'll give it to the cops to give out to
foreigners as needed.</p>

<p>First I'm going to study, write a card to Alexis, study, eat,
practice, study, get my bike, practice, etcetera.</p>

<p>Okay.  I've studied; I may be able to ask "may I park my bike
here?" when I get to the bike parking lot.</p>

<p>I will ask.  I can easily do it.  I persevere.  Whutwhut!</p>

<p class=date>1:09pm</p>

<p>Got my bike.  When I uttered my canned phrase, he didn't seem to
understand me.  Ah well, fuckit.  I did communicate enough to
understand the rules there.  A ticket vending machine sits at the end
of one of the rows; it seems likely that yesterday the guy was
pointing me to that machine, though I didn't understand what he was
saying.</p>

<p>Price for 24 hours of parking 100yen for bicycles and 130yen for
scooters.  No price set for segways yet.  Not that I've seen any
around, which I haven't.</p>

<p>So then I was like, "so, tell me, snoops, where's my bike now?" and
it took a while to get it across, but finally I was able to show him
where I parked, and where my bike wasn't and he was like, "is one of
these your bike?" referring to some over by their booth.</p>

<p><em>oh please, oh please</em> I hoped my bike was there.
searchsearchsearch yes!!</p>

<p>"Please pay two hundred en," they say en instead of yen.  Gladly.
Basically gladly.  What if I had found the bike last night and just
jacked it back from them?  Have they a system by which they would have
later identified it had I parked there again?  If I had found it and
jacked it last night, when I rolled up would they have been like, "hey
jack, you jacked that; jack it back, mac!" ??</p>

<p>Who knows.  Whatever.  I'm going to study some more.  I intend to
know the 12 verbs and conjugations Ayana showed me two weeks ago.</p>

<p>Persist persist persist and ignore the frustration.  I was able to
communicate with the guys at the bike parking place and I don't
understand all things bike-parking, but I've got some basics.</p>

<p>100 yen per day for a bike.</p>

<p>2000 yen per month for a bike.</p>

<p>6000 yen per three months for a bike.</p>

<p>I joked with them on this last price.  Why would anyone pay 6000
ahead of time when it's not a better price?</p>

<p>One weird thing on the month tickets; it seems they are only
available on the 25th and 26th of the preceding month.  But they are
good until the end of the next month, so it's like getting 4 days
free, but really it isn't cause I just have to pay 4 days ahead of
time next time.  It's only like getting 4 days free each time I skip
and don't park my bike for the first 25 days of a month.</p>

<p>Good thing is that I made it back to my train line without getting
lost.  That's four blocks, two new lines and three new stations that
I've navigated and remembered for an hour.</p>

<p>Hurry up, fucking train.  I've written all of the above and this
and the train hasn't moved yet.  And I got out my computer after I got
on the train.</p>

<p>About to go .... now.</p>

<p>I also need to eat; I've not yet eaten today.</p>

<p class=date>3:29pm</p>

<p>Now I'm home.  Now I've eaten.  Now I've ironed a shirt.  If by
ironed I mean I've ironed most of the parts of a shirt that can be
easily ironed and easily seen when I'm wearing it.</p>

<p>Japanese words are more often showing up in my dreams. A few
Japanese patterns of speech are beginning to feel natural.</p>

<p class=dream>A kid was on the street corner with a yoyo ball thing
that he was throwing toward the street and then yanking it back well
before it hit any traffic.  Then he'd throw it again and yank it back.
He missed catching the ball a few times and was unaware that when he
missed it, he almost hit a woman walking behind him.  This happened a
few times and she was patiently not saying anything but he kept doing
it unaware and I went over to say something to him.  I did so in a
very loving way and he had pretty blue attentive eyes.  I told him
this and he smiled.  I blessed him and the yoyoball toy and went on my
way.</p>

<p class=dream>Found it strange, but not unsettling that I didn't
flirt with the woman, didn't look carefully into her eyes and tell her
how pretty they were.  Didn't even know what color they were.</p>

<p class=dream>Went about my way and noticed that *I* had the
yoyoball; somehow I had forgotten to give it to the kid when I left.
I toyed with tossing it a few times in this large empty gymnasium
thing but found I wasn't very good at it.</p>

<p class=dream>Then I saw a large clear plastic sink full of water -
about 2.5 feet on a side and the drain had just been opened and I was
delighted to see a tight whirlpool all the way from the top to the
bottom of the sink.  I stared down the whirlpool like it was a reverse
telescope or looking down a long tunnel in a fun house.  I love
whirlpools.  The physics is just so magical.</p>

<p>previous dream</p>

<p class=dream>I had just missed the train back home after my year of
being here.  It was bound for Kentucky then Georgia or something wacky
like that.  I had ignored preparation for my trip back home, and
neglected to note that I was supposed to be at the train station by 7
am instead of noon.  Talked to a conductor as I noticed my error and
he noted that the traiin I had intended to take was having a problem
and everyone on the train was getting sick.  I was delighted to have
had my angels' guidance to keep me off a tainted train.</p>

<p class=dream>He asked me where I wanted to ultimately go and by
rerouting the train, everyone on the train recovered and I got to go
where I wanted.</p>

<p>Overtime was nice.  Easy.  Full of thanks from the staff for my
help.  The school is soooo cute cause they've got only 3 digit numbers
for the students, and some students have only got 2 digits!!!  I had
three classes and 1 voice lesson.  All pretty easy.  For one lesson I
actually had a plan of sorts, but they kept just asking me questions
so I was content to answer them.  I tried twice to stay on a track.  I
wonder if they were intentionally flirting; one of them asked, "where
is your regular school?" and I heard "can I see you again
somewhere?"</p>

<p>Not likely, but maybe.</p>

<p>Andrea, Callum, and Janet were the other instructors.</p>

<p>My bicyle</p>

<p>is gone</p>

<p>again.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>It's not like I fucking parked it in the middle of the goddam
street!  I parked it IN A BICYCLE PARKING LOT!!!  The motherfucker
gestured toward the lot when I rode the bike up and he didn't say pay
first he just pointed down one aisle of the lot and I'm like "er?" and
he's like just fucking gesturing down the lot so I'm like fine and I
go down the row looking looking looking looking looking and finally
found a spot available and I come back and there's my bike all hunky
dory fine and dandy so then later in the evening when there were MORE
SPACES AVAILABLE IN THE LOT, I parked my bike again, although I'll
<em>admit</em> yes I did not "ask" him if I could and I did not park
it on the same aisle and I did park it for longer but now I get back
and poof the fucking bike is gone.</p>

<p>FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>I just want to fucking DESTROY something like all these empty bike
racks just rip them apart but their all made of steel and shit so I
can't and it's <em>polite</em> to destroy private property in Japan
and it's not <em>polite</em> to piss all over someone else's bike
because it didn't get towed and it's not <em>polite</em> to kick the
door open to the police box and start yelling and knocking over
furniture and punching cops in the jaw</p>

<p>FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>I've tried to fucking ask people WHERE I can park the bike but no
one knows.  No one has translated to English the rules of this goddamn
fucking fucked up city where HUNDREDS of bikes are parked IN CLEARLY
LABELED <b>NO BICYCLE PARKING</b> ZONES and I can't park in a
designated parking lot?  I can't get instructions from someone..  I
mean not even implicit instructions like hold out your hand if you
want money or anything?????</p>

<p>FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>So I went into the police station all humble and like whahwahwah I
lost my bike (AGAIN GOD DAMMIT) and they got some English cat on the
phone and he's all "was it stolen or towed?" and I'm like how the fuck
am I supposed to know they didn't leave a note on my bike; the shit is
<em>gone</em>.  And he's like did you pay money?  No maybe I should
have shoved 1500 yen in the fucker's face and be all take the money
now bitch just don't tow my fucking bike away take the money take it
all I obviously don't FUCKING NEED money in this fucked up
country!</p>

<p>FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>But you know what?  You know what????</p>

<p>I have <em>pinned</em> with a safety pin my old wallet to my wall
with a note</p>

<pre>
                                 I
                             PERSEVERE
</pre>

<p>Fuck you, Japan.  Fuck you.</p>
