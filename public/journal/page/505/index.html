<p>Cool.  Amy has the same dancing-technique as me. 
Dance alone, who cares what we look like, dance to
sweat.  Awesome.</p>

<p>Dude is choosing not to sign the contract for the
phone.</p>

<p>Gene's rechargable battery pack quit working.</p>

<p>Dude is going to make a fake Promote-Houston
website:</p>

<ul>
<li>Houston has the most fast food, fewest outdoor
exercise opportunities, most pollution, most HazMat
calls, etc.</li>

<li>We have subsidies for professional sports team
owners (if you own a team, and need a stadium, we'll
build one for you!)</li>
</ul>

<p>Good night.</p>

<p>While working and minding my own business, <em>BAM!</em> I heard
outside and then screech and such.  I looked out the window and didn't
see any signs of an accident, until I noticed a guy from the business
next door take off his apron and jump the fence while looking toward
the intersection.</p>

<p>I dialed 911 as I arrived outside.  I could see three other people
on cell phones, so I wasn't surprised that the dispatcher said the
accident had already been covered.</p>

<p>Apparently a lady in a Camry ran the red light and got creamed by a
Jeep Cherokee.  She was crying, and another woman was talking to her,
telling her to chill, etc.  I talked to the guy in the Jeep, who was
on the edge of falling asleep (which I know can be the first step to a
coma after a concussion) so I just kept him awake and not moving.</p>

<p>Ambulances arrived within 18 minutes of the accident and they
attended the lady first.  She had some cuts on her head and hand it
seemed.  Her husband arrived, and ironically he was on crutches with
his foot in a cast.  <em>Now</em> who's more injured??</p>

<p>The weirdest part about the whole thing is that her car was not
just still drivable, but still driving after being spun into some
guy's driveway, and drove forward and crashed into his fence, breaking
the 2-by-10 at the bottom.  Wow.</p>

<p>I've been sick since Monday morning and it's sucked.</p>

<p>I missed work Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, not counting the staff
meeting I attended Monday morning.  It became apparent then that I
needed to be at home.</p>

<p>The next day I was worse.  I passed out in the kitchen while
heating some soup.  I was surprised to find myself on my back sprawled
across the doorway between kitchen and carpeted dining area.
Fortunately my head hit the carpet, not tile.</p>

<p>Got a ride to the doctor, who suggested that I had the flu.  I
didn't know what I had, but that it sucked.  I don't get sick.  So if
I do get sick, I'm never sure how to handle it.</p>

<p>She told me to get some oscillicoccinum from Whole Foods.  It
worked amazingly well.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I *might* transcribe from my handwritten joural into here.</p>

<p>I left work early yesterday.</p>

<p>Last night I had a hacking dry heaving cough that pretty much
pissed me off.  I said, "piss off, cough, I'm trying to read."</p>

<p>It didn't listen until I stood in steamy hot shower to moisturize
my lungs.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Now I'm at work again, and I might leave early again.  Being sick
is dumb.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Oh my gosh.  My CD player has been on pause since.... Friday a week
ago.  Technology is pretty amazingly patient.</p>

<p>Relatively speaking, this is being written way after the rally.</p>

<p>Houston Rally was absolutely great.  By far a super duper favorite
rally for me!  There were so many so-excellent things! </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The name of the rally, "Ants Con Queso."  This theme
perfectly ties in 'Con,' the song "Ants and Cheese," <em>and</em>
memorializes a previous theme, "Fricke Fiesta Con Queso."  Perfect
perfect perfect!</p></li>

<li><p>The price of the rally, $13.99!  What an amazing bargain for
such a fabulously cool event!  After last year's rally, we got some
flack for such a high price rally, $35 or so.  So we slashed the price
of this rally and said it was "brought to you by priceline dot con,"
again working in 'con.' We let people pay more if they wanted, and
made them pay more if they were late registering.  I hope we'll do it
again next year...</p></li>

<li><p>Electronic mugbook on CD!  This is a definite first for
Southwest District, and I'm so proud of Brian and Graham for all their
work on it.  Thanks also to Colleen and Meg for taking twice the
required number of pictures!</p></li>

<li><p>Custom T-shirts!  We had Pahl With An H make stencils and
everyone spray painted their own shirts with fabulous dazzling colors
and designs and stencil awesomeness!</p></li>

<li><p>Early morning worship, timed to end with the rising of the sun
on Saturday morning, absolutely beautiful intimate worship.</p></li>

<li><p>I was not in charge!  Wheeeee!!</p></li>

<li><p>Susie was elected to YAC as adult at large, and Amy is our new
YCR!!!</p>

<p>I'm so thrilled to have such great leadership from our local youth
group!  I'm excited to hear Amy's adventures on Youth Council.</p></li>

<li><p>Mary and Shea joined us all the way from Wisconsin!</p></li>

<li><p>Age limit of 20 brought some old school youth!  kT, Lauuryn,
Ryan, Elizabeth!  (others?)</p></li>

<li><p>Great fun prom where everyone dressed up (including me).  Crazy
fast dancing = me, Charlie, Kristen, with everyone in a circle around
us.</p></li>

<li><p>Dancing Toast!</p></li>

<li><p>Nick Carter showed up for Silent Football!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The talkin' and chillin' with all my peeps was icing on the whole
weekend.  Great great great great great!</p>

<p>At home after work, I showered my last shower before Sunday noon,
and took a lovely nap.  As I lay down, I set my phone on Silent and
placed a thankful blessing intention in the world, "let me wake up at
the right time."</p>

<p>"Not counting Spot waking me up," because amazingly,
<em>invariably</em>, Spot will jump up on the bed *just* as I am at
that stage between awake and sleep where any little thing will bring
me back awake.</p>

<p>I began to fall asleep and Spot jumped up on the bed.  I wonder if
he can tell just as I'm falling asleep.</p>

<p>I woke up 1.5 hours later, refreshed, happy.  I looked over at my
phone to see if anyone had called.  My phone was ringing.</p>

<p>So thankful to my higher source connection to wake me up at the
right time.  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-) !!!</p>

<p>It was Graham, asking if my digital camera has a USB cable, and if
so can they can use it for electronic mugbook pics.  Yes and Yes.</p>

<p>So I packed for the rally (*), drove over to work, got the cable, wrote
this entry.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>(*) Back in the day, I used to spend <em>hours</em> packing for
rallies, having my bags ready a couple days beforehand.  It's been a
pretty long time since those days.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Oh, and today is the day that Kristen emailed me and asked how on
earth I keep from being physically sore after sitting at a computer
all day.  The short answer is that I don't, but I gave her some tips
on correct posture and placement of keyboard and mouse.  But the point
of this is that I took a pic of my mouse setup and sent it to her via
email. I love my camera!</p>

<p class=date>11:46pm CST Wednesday 16 January 2002</p></p>

<p>I may suddenly have some insight as to why I can get more work done
when no one is here to bother me.</p>

<p>Earlier this morning I heard the doorbell ring (meaning someone
came in our suite), that someone talked to Deborah about Girl Scout
Cookies.</p>

<p>Five minutes ago, Karla walked into our office (where Minh, Dave
and I work) and gave me the GSC order form, "here, you can order Girl
Scout Cookies; pass it around when you are done."</p>

<p>Two minutes ago, after ordering 1 box of Thin Mints, I gave the
form to Minh without a word (but took some of the crackers he had been
snacking on).  Minh said, "that's a good trade."  (a few crackers for
boxes of cookies (granted he has to <em>pay</em> for the cookies, but
whatever.))</p>

<p>Minh called his girlfriend on the phone, "Baby, do you want some
Girl Scout Cookies?  Thin Mints?  How many boxes?  I'm ordering some
right now.  Okay, bye."</p>

<p>Then Minh gave the list to Dave, who said, "oh, is it Girl Scout
Cookie time again?"</p>

<p><b>HOW DID HE NOT NOTICE ANY OF THE PREVIOUS INTERACTIONS???????</b></p>

<p>Why do I notice (and sometimes get distracted by) everything around
me?</p>

<p>At one level I'm thinking, "holy shit, man, pay attention!" and on
another level I'm envious that he can apparently focus, and on another
level I'm wondering <em>do I really notice a lot, or do I just think I
notice a lot?</em>.  Hmmmmmm.</p>

<p>I don't know, but I'm now going to nin din work mode.</p>

<p>Fun pictures recently, and I'm not going to give them each their own entry.</p>

<p><a href='/images/construction/59/shepherd_exit/ROB!_8jan2002.jpg'><img src='/images/construction/59/shepherd_exit/thumbs/ROB!_8jan2002.jpg' align=left></a>This is my
name in the concrete.  The 2002 doesn't show up particularly clearly, but I know it's there!</p>

<p><a href='/images/peeps/Gene/gene_fell.jpg'><img src='/images/peeps/Gene/thumbs/gene_fell.jpg' align=left></a>Last night as
Dude, John, Gene and I were riding bikes around Whole Foods parking lot on Bellaire (Holcombe?), 
Gene fell off his bike in a super low speed low impact bizarre "how-the-hell-did-you-just-fall-over?"
kind of way.  He was kind enough to pose for the pic.</p>

<p><a href='/images/art/photography/four_flags.jpg'><img src='/images/art/photography/thumbs/four_flags.jpg' align=left></a>I took a pic of a bank on Kirby.
My artsy-est picture yet!</p>

<p><a href='/images/peeps/Dude/movin1.jpg'><img src='/images/peeps/Dude/thumbs/movin1.jpg' align=left></a>Just tonight, Dude helped me pic up
my old recliner, and Eric and Meredith&rsquo;s futon.  See, the recliner was hand-me-downed from my ex-ex-ex-ex girlfriend
Christine&rsquo;s parents.   When Wende and I moved into our house, she didn&rsquo;t think it matched the decor, so we gave it to
Maggie.  Now that I have my own apartment again, I asked Maggie if I could have it back.</p></p>

<p>Also, Eric and Meredith loaned a futon to Maggie's brother-in-law Kevin, and then he quit using it so they loaned
it to me, with the understanding that I'll buy it when I have the money.</p>

<p><a href='/images/peeps/Dude/movin2.jpg'><img src='/images/peeps/Dude/thumbs/movin2.jpg' align=left></a>Dude helped me move them today,
but we learned our lesson from when we <a href="/cgi-bin/journal.pl?type=all&date=2000/04/20#PPcouch">moved the couch:</a> get a bigger truck.

<p>I just faxed a reservation for Bryn and I at the hostel in France!
In London, we're going to get floor space at her friends apartment,
which is awesomely cheaper.  This is a guy from Egypt that she knows
from OZ.  So fuckin' awesome!</p>

<p>This weekend after the houston rally, Bryn and Elizabeth are going
to stay for a night over at my apartment.  I'm looking forward to
that, but I figure we'll be too crazy tired to even talk much.</p>

<p>Still fun though!</p>

<p>I'm just so frickin' excited about this!</p>

<p>Here at work I can't surf the web today.  Our ISPs DNS went down.
Ironically, I can still chat on AIM.  How weird is that?  Not so weird
if I know how it all works (IP versus name lookup), but it's
definitely ironic.</p>

<p>Jason gave me a link to a story about a dude who deposited a
$95,000 check.  It's near the bottom of the list at <a
href="https://www.bored.com">bored.com</a>.  Crazy.</p>
