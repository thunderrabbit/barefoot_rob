<p>Beaner and I took the train to Jollimont and walked
by teh botanical gardens to the Melbourne Unitarian
Peace Memorial Church.</p>

<p>Small gongregation in this room that could seat 200
comfortably, though it would be hot.</p>

<p>Today there are two speakers who described the
situation in Indonesia with East Timor becoming free
and how to help facilitate the process so the
residents can actually have soveriegnty and make
decisions about things that actually affect their
lives.</p>

<p>Now we are in questions and answer session.</p>

<p>19 people in the room here includng the young adult
speakers and Bryn and I.  about 10 people over age
60.</p>

<p>Bryn's nose is experiencing allergies and
sniffles.</p>

<p>The members here seem much more aware of the
situation than I am.</p>

<p class=date>12:39pm</p>

<p class=note>(this is being written on Thursday 22
Feb)</p>

<p>After the fellowship, Bryn and I joined them for
sandwiches and conversation.  We talked to a man named
Bob who had been a professional lacrosse player and is
now in charge of lacrosse stuff or something.  He was
part of the over 60 crowd at the church.</p>

<p>He described getting in trouble for unnecessary
roughness at a game.  Bryn and I wondered later about
his grandkids all, "Grandpa, you're the coolest
grandpa ever!" while he sat in the penalty box.</p>

<p>We just saw kangaroos!!  In the wild even, right
beside a golf course.  We are at Joe and Mary's house,
and went swimming (in their saltwater pool) and then
had Aussie barbecue, which does not inolve barbecue
sauce, or beans, or potatoes of any variety.  Big cuts
of lamb grilled with vegetables - red pepper and
stuff.</p>

<p>At dusk we walked about a mile from the house,
crossing a golf course along the way, and then saw a
bunch (a mob) of kangaroos!  Probably about 50 or 60
in a few distinct groups.  Bryn got some pictures of
me with roos in the background, and we got some of
them jumping and even got a pic of a momma with baby
in pouch.  I'm not sure if they were close enough to
discern it in the pics though.</p>

<p>After I ran out of film (1 roll only, doh!) we got
about 6 meters from a couple of roos.  So amazing!</p>

<p class=date>10:07 pm</p>

<p>Mr Rob and Mss Bryn begin a game of Silent Football
where we can each tattle and the other becomes
dictator fo that moment.</p>

<p>"Miss Bryn is correct; Mr Rob receives one half of
one sip of Miss Bryn's Dr Pepper."</p>

<p class=date>10:35 pm</p>

<p>We stopped playing in order to look up how big is a
mole (6.02 * 10^23) because that is how many penance
point I awarded myself for something.</p>

<p class=date>12:30 am 19 February 2001</p>

<p>Bryn and I have been talking heaps about YAC and
YRUU and how to make them both better.</p>

<p class=date>1:45 am</p>

<p>Brainstorming things I can do toward finding a
different more perfect job for me:</p>

<ul>
<li>Look up rotary.org</li>
<li>look up Youth for Understanding</li>
</ul>

<p class=date>3:11 am</p>

<p>Just had the most amazing conversation with Bryn. 
Our homework:  I will contact <a
href="https://www.rotary.org">rotary.org</a> to see
what they do, and Bryn will write a letter that she
has needed to write for a while.</p>

<p>Bryn and I played the most awesome variation of
Silent Football.</p>

<p>The football is moved using the normal rules,
except:</p>

<ul>
<li>we can fwap to ourselves and through ourselves (as
long as it doesn't go backwards through ourselves). 
Like I can fwap fwap fwap and it goes from me to Bryn,
to me, to Bryn.</li>

<li>we can fwap any number of times up to about
60.</li>

<li>we can zoom to ourselves.</li>

<li>if someone makes an error, the other raises their
hand and the one who made the error becomes
dictator:</li>
</ul>

<pre>
  "Miss Bryn."

  "Mr Dictator, Mr Rob fwapped a fwap fwap."

  "Miss Bryn is correct; Mr Rob receives one 
   one hundredth(*) of a penance point."

  "Mr Rob."

  "Madame Dictator, Miss Bryn is a tattle tale."

  "False. Customary tip of the hat..."
</pre>

<p>It's tricky when we both raise our hands at the
same
time.</p>

<p>But so much fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>(*) The game ended when I awarded Mr Rob one mole
of penance points and we looked it up online to see
how a mole is defined.  (It's the number of hydrogen
atoms there are in one gram of hydrogen (6.023 *
10^23))</p>

<p>Just now while in the shower, I was reliving our
conversation.  Bryn expressed how completely she
wished  I could know how much I helped her, and I
cried happy tears, as named by Wende's and my marriage
counselor a couple weeks ago.</p>

<p>Bryn, know how much I live and love to give this
type of support.</p>

<p>Know how much you help me see my life path.</p>

<p>6am began wakeup and breakfast noises, and two
women arrived to apply make-up to all the bride's
maids.  I got up, not for make-up, but to get caught
up on all my email!  Yay!!</p>

<p>Bryn slept until 8am or so and emerged squinty eyed

<p class="message">Hello Rob.  We are at Irene and Nick's wedding
reception.  i can't remember the last one of these i attended but it
must have beAn quite some time ago.  it is super dark in here.
anyways, i love nick's smile (as i have expressed and wish for you to
remeber) and irene is so beautiful and their happiness in an odd way
definitely inspires me.  who knows when these same rituals will be
performed in my honor, but i await them excitedly.  anyways, i hope
you are having as good a time as everyone else and especially me.
smiles.  brynsies</p>

<p>what about a greek wedding?</p>

<p class="message">a greek wedding is an amazing way to see a different
culture in action.  i feel privileged to have gotten to experience
this, especially with you and wende.  When else would i have ever had
a chance like this?  this is OZsome.</p>

<p>We definitely are blessed to experience such a cultural event.
Hanging out with you in OZ has beAn beyond incredible!!</p>

<p class="message">Truue!  It is hard to believe it is real but i think
before anything when i think 'Melbourne with R& W' i will think of
sitting at the park outside Luna Park and looking at the birds and
playing with the devil sticks and walking and being happy.  that was
so nice and good and memorable.  i can't describe my plethora of
emotions but i know that part of me is definitely noticing the changes
in 'me' since i have beAn in oz because of my interactions with
someone from back home.  i compare my old self with rob and then think
about 'newer me' interacting with the same rob and i am amazed at how
i have changed, for better or for worse.  you are helping me to see
those changes.  i definitely thank you for that.</p>

<p class="message">Heaps better.  You are growing indescribably mature
and I'm so proud of you and honored to be part of your life.  I
believe that by traveling the world, you are experiencing SO MANY
different cultures and things that you really get to define who *you*
are amidst all the everything.  We met a barefoot man who had thin
flipflops and apparently makes a living making and performing with and
selling devil sticks.  You now have the choice of doing that for part
of your life.</p>

<p>You are experiencing a Greek wedding.  Now this gives you a sense
of what it might be like to marry a greek god of a man (at least the
weding part but)</p>

<p>You are meeting millions of peep from different countries and you
are welcome to visit many of them whenever you visit their country.
You see their culture and traditions and language and can incorporate
those into your life.</p>

<p class="message">truue, but my cynicism for life (and horror movies)
has become a very big pessimistic part of my life
which i attribute to my leaving home just a bit too
soon.  c'est la vie.  i will learn.</p>

<p>The batteries I've got in here are the ones I put
in before the flight.  They are still 7/8ths full, or
maybe 13/16ths full.</p>

<p>Here is the story of the keyboard at Luna Park:</p>

<p>After the wedding, Bryn and I were dropped off at 
Luna Park by Roxy, Carlos and Kate, while they went to
look at a possible new place for Roxy to live, or
maybe Kate.  I don't know; Bryn probably does.</p>

<p>Anyway, Bryn and I wanted some foodage, so she
helped us find a fish and chips place.  She said that
every restaurant serves fish and chips, and they're
really good and really cheap.  I had her order first,
cause I'm still a bit nervous about knowing customs,
etc.  She ordered fish and chips and a coke.  I
ordered "the same thing and orange juice."</p>

<p>Like in a US grocery store seafood counter, they
had fillets of fish layed out behind the glass
counter.  They were fresh, not frozen.</p> 

<p>He grabbed two fillets and flopped them in a batter
and then into the deep fryer.  He dumped in a large
portion of what we would call french fries, except
they were cut larger than ours - really fat french
fries.</p>

<p>(To be clear, I didn't actually watch all this
process, but I saw the before and after fish; I can
pretty much guess what happened.  I did not see the
chips before they were cooked, but they were hot as,
so I believe he cooked them there.)</p>

<p>(I have just successfully used Aussie slang, "hot
as."  Instead of actually finishing the phrase,
Aussies may describe something: "easy as" or "old as"
or anything like that.)</p>

<p>We paid and went outside to the park (about an acre
of grass with a few palm trees on it, and street
performers and picnickers) to eat while a flock of
seagulls and pigeons eagerly waited for some
munchies.</p>

<p>The fish and the chips were still hot as; I could
barely eat them.  The brilliant blue sky smiled over
us and bright sun smiled even more.  We sat in a
slightly worn area of grass because we were still
wearing dress up wedding clothes.  (Though I had taken
off my shirt and tie - just had on a white
undershirt.)</p>

<p>Ate chips and fish by ripping it apart as finger
food and had ketchup ("tomato sauce"?) and tartare
sauce which was like our tartar sauce, but with no
bits of pickle (is that what it is?)</p>

<p>By the end of the meal, I decided I pretty much
don't like fish and chips.  The fish part was fine,
but the french fries were really fat and therefore
quite mushy on the inside.  If I want that, then I'll
get mashed potatoes.</p>

<p>When finished, we flung the remaining chips to the
birds and watched them pounce on all the delicious
morsels.  They were finished faster than  I could pull
out my camera and take a picture.  Really.</p>

<p>- - -</p>

<p>Luna Park is free to get in, and then costs money
to ride each ride, or one can get an all day pass for
$19.95 AUS.  A single ticket for a single ride was
like $3 AUS.</p>

<p>We just wanted to ride the two bigger roller
coasters and the Gravitron (spinning thing where
people are accelerated against the outer wall)</p>

<p>Rode the big roller coaster first, which was not
hugely big, but circled the entire park twice (the
park was about 10 acres - nothing like the size of a
Six Flags, but a tad bigger than a traveling carnival
that will set up rides in a large parking lot (and
much more permanent - this park has been around for at
least 30 years, according to a story that Bryn told
about a woman she knows who rode the roller coaster
when she was 7 or so and closed her eyes the entire
ride.  She rode it again this year at age 30 something
so that she could ride it with her eyes open.))</p>

<p>So the point is, we rode this coaster, whice was
not too big, and not too small, but had a brakeman
standing in the middle of the train on every ride!  He
just stood there and pulled a brake at the parts of
the track that needed the train to slow down. 
Amazing!  And certainly something not very common in
US.</p>

<p>He wore earplugs ("why are <em>we</em> not wearing
earplugs?") and no expression as he spent his day
going around and around and around the track.  Bryn
and I decided his job must be pretty boring.</p>

<p>This coaster was particularly lumpy (not bumpy like
dehdhehdeh, but lumpy like whuhwhuhwhuhwhuh) and
certainly felt weird on my spine.</p>

<p>We waited in a slightly shorter line for the next
ride, a metal mousetrap type ride and tons smoother
than the first.  This mousetrap coaster didn't have
the tight 180 degree turns of the one at Lagoon north
of Salt Lake City, but this one was taller and
faster.</p>

<p>While in line for the mousetrap ride, I noted a
tire used to slow the train was super old and worn
down.  I said, "that tire is worn as" to Bryn.</p>

<p>She said "no, you can't say worn as, but I don't
really know why."</p>

<p>She soon realized, "worn is too sophisticated a
word."</p>

<p>"That tire is old as?"</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>After the mousetrap, we went to the Gravitron,
which did not have a line at all, so we actually had
to wait several minutes inside the hot circular room. 
They don't care if people turn upside down or anything
they want.  Wow!  I decided I would not try to turn
upside down though, because I had all my stuff in my
pockets.  I patted them to assess that mykeyboard and
Handspring Visor and camera were still there.</p>

<p>My keyboard was not.</p>

<p>"Bryn; I don't have my keyboard."</p>

<p>I didn't freak because I still had my Visor.  ("The
rest of this shit you could have set on fire...")  I
was just, "hmm.  it must have fallen out on one of the
roller coasters."</p>

<p>The gravitron started spinning and people started
yelling or turning upside down.  Please note that "or"
is an exclusive or; no one was yelling <em>and</em>
turning upside down.</p>

<p>I turned pretty effectively sideways, and then sat
up to take a few pictures of this great photo op with
people all happy and sideways or upside down in this
crazy spinny artificial gravity world.</p>

<p>I was surprised that people were surprised that I
was able to "sit up" during the ride.  It didn't seem
all that difficult to me.  If I rode it a couple more
times, I imagine I could get the hang of the gravity
and kneel.  It would take me a while to be able to
stand up, but I could do that after a several tries I
bet.</p>

<p>- - -</p>

<p>After the Gravitron, we walked back to the second
roller coaster and had the guy look in each car. 
(Each car could hold 4 people only; there were two
cars, but I couldn't remember what color car we were
on.)  He did not find it.</p>

<p>Over to the first roller coaster and asked the guy
at the gate.  Once the train arrived back in the
station, he checked the train, and then walked up the
first incline and down the first hill.</p>

<p>He came back with my keyboard unfolded but
essentially still intact.  "I'm not sure how good it
will be," he consoled.</p>

<p>"It is <em>great</em>; thank you very much," I
said, hoping it would still work.</p>

<p>I caught up with Beaner who was walking to the
front of Luna Park to tell our ride why we were late. 
It was exactly four o'clock.</p>

<p>They were later than us, so I tested out the
keyboard using Bryn's palms as a table.</p>

<p>Our ride arrived to this scene and we had them take
a picture and then told them the story.</p>

<p>The keyboard works fine, but one of the hinges is
broken so it's a bit less sturdy.  Also, it doesn't
latch shut on all four corners, but it stays mostly
closed when it's folded up.</p>

<p>This is me, typing on my keyboard and Handspring
Visor after my keyboard fell off the roller coaster
and we didn't find it until about 35 minutes later. </p>

<p class=date>4:47 pm</p>

<p>We're at Roxy's house; super thanks to them for
driving us to and from Luna Park.  We're watching
cricket, the most boring game.</p>

<p class=date>4:58 pm</p>

<p>Now Bryn is fixing some Milo (chocolate drink) for
me and we are watching a pirated copy of Charlie's
Angels on DVD.</p>

<p>We are at Nick and Irene's reception.</p>

<p>Chris says, "I'm troubled by that," when he saw my
keyboard.  "Your job doesn't happen to be in computers
does it?"</p>

<p class=date>8:22 pm</p>

<p>"You can eat everything on the table, Chris."</p>

<p>"Not a chance.  But if you put a line of beers
around, then I might give it a nudge."</p>

<p>Me: "Give it a nudge?"</p>

<p>Chris: "Yeah, write it down."</p>

<p>Me: "HAAhahahahaaaaa!!    Okay."</p>

<p class=date>8:31 pm</p>

<p>Mike says of my keyboard, "that's amazing."</p>

<p class=date>10:15 pm</p>

<p>So hot.  So sweaty.  Dancing Rob's Crazy Dance for
a while and then Bryn taught me The Brazilian Foot
Dance (Hi Sally!), which is really fast and cool as
shit when we got it going correctly.</p>

<p>Chris asked if I am writing about his amazing moves
on the dance floor; he claims that I must have missed
him on the dance floor.  He's also not sweating.</p>

<p><em>now</em> Chris just broke a wine glass setting
it down heavily in front of Wende, encouraging her to
have some fine Victoria Bitter, a beer which I think
tastes like bark.  Wende stuck her tongue out at the
flavor.  Bleah.</p>

<p>Wedding was long and lovely; Bryn and I sat
together and I took lots of pictures.</p>

<p>Now Bryn and I are gettng fish and chips before we
go play at Luna Park!</p>

<p>I exceptionally appreciate having Bryn as a tour
guide.</p>

<p>The Bridal Party has embarked on 4 or 5 hours
(<em>hours</em>, wearing their dresses and suits) of
having pictures taken around the city.</p>
