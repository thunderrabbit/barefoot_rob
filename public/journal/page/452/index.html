<p>Chatting with Elizabeth, a cute college girl friend of Barbie's who
is over just to visit.  She looks a lot like Marcel's Kayse. She and
Becky were talking and smoking in the kitchen, so I stayed out of the
stink in the living room.</p>

<p>Elizabeth and I have been talking about travel; she's been to parts
of Europe: Germany, Paris, Switzerland I think.</p>

<p>She's a journalism major in school, specializing in public
relations.  I had to ask her how that was part of journalism, but now
I understand.  When she retires from her career, she wants to take
pictures for National Geographic.  I wonder why she doesn't make that
her career.</p>

<p>She says she just doesn't see that as a career, but more of a
hobby.  But why not get paid for what you love?</p>

date: friday 4 october 2002
from: gin
subj: Gin in Gijón, Asturias

Cheers!  This e-mail thing is so groovy!   I got mail again, and I
want to read them all 5 times!  I have finally arrived to the
Cantabric Sea, my first beach last night, the ®playa de espaÒa®. 
Yesterday while walking from a mountain road, i was routed onto the
highway.  After all, the ¥Camino de Santiago¥ is one of the more
ancient roads in Europe, of course it is a highway now.  When I got to
town this morning I confirmed the news with 10 government agencies
that this is it, no foot trails or farm roads.  I was ready for an
easy road, one with walking paths and blue signs with painted yellow
shells on them indicating the camino.  The ¥camino¥ and life are
becoming more synonymous every step.  I lasted about 2 miles on the
highway yesterday before sliding into a bar and drinking a couple of
spiked coffees with cream. 

      There was an 88 year old guy there with crutches behind his
chair.  During the civil war of Spain (officially 1936-1939, but
starting back around ¥32)  his legs were frostbitten. He lived
outside, fighting, for six years.  We talked for several hours. I had
been slightly shaken up after a few close calls with cargo trucks out
on the road.   My plan was not to get back on the highway.    There is
something about talking with a war survivor, (one of several elderly
men i have talked to this week that survived the war by fighting on
both sides at one time or another during that war- that resulted in
Franco's dictatorship from 1939 to his death in 1974) that reminds me
that the urban assault vehicles that pass me like rockets are not the
worst dangers in life.  After talks of history and family and now i
asked him if i could get to where i am now (GijÛn) from that road side
bar without getting back on the highway.  Ten other people had told me
¥no, impossible...¥. Without pointing out the obvious, that the 10
mile trip would be converted into a 20 mile trip, he gave me detailed
instructions of how to get here.  What a gem!  I usually don't take
pictures of those i find the most precious, i don't know why, but i
got a picture of him and bought him a shot of brandy for today.

      On my little ¥credencial¥ of the ¥Camino¥, that if i was
visiting churches or hostels, would be full of stamps recording the
name and the date of my visit to those places, is a map of the various
¥caminos to Santiago de Compostela¥.  From here it says 351
kilometers.  Then to Finisterre, at least another 100.  My father
reminded me when i spoke with him the other day that i have been as
far as Dallas from San Antonio (Texas) for a month.  Inching my way
across my map, with a deadline in mind, is such a silly sensation.  In
Holland i will be, October 24, if I have reached Finisterre or not. 
So, the news of today, that the 351 plus kilometers is still entirely
more than that due to my alternative route search was taken  with a
contemplative dose of cheese cake.  I have to laugh, because i have
been on the same ¥lost path¥ since the day i left from Le Mont
St. Michelle in Normandy.  The priest there looked at me like i was
insane, with the similar tone of the woman in the tourist office
today, and said, ®there is no foot path to Santiago from here®.  My
motto has become, ®if i don't get lost at least once a day, there is
no adventure®. This helps me through the moments a few kilometers down
a dead-end mountain path, when i know i must turn back, possibly for
the second or third time.  So even thought the clock is ticking again,
there is no use in ruffling my feathers.  Feather ruffling is only
effective when there are witnesses anyway.  As i learned on the
mountain, to not be happy is not to be unhappy.  Emotions are the
costume in front of the act, when there is no stage and no audience,
there is no one to care if i am naked or in a dress. There is no use
in wasting valuable energy on being dramatic if there is no one there
to spend it on.  Ecstasy with an aire of placidity is how i find my
way. I talk to most of the people i meet with the pretense of asking
for directions. I if had found the ¥easy road¥, i might not have stuck
with it for long anyway. 

    Now that i am back at the ocean, i will wander on the beach roads,
listening to the roar of the sea, peaking out on the cliffs and rocks
with an occasional white sand beach i could practice head standing
on.  I think the group i left Roncevalles with, on the main French
route of the ®camino®are getting there today, or this week, they might
be home already.  It will not hurt my feelings if i never get to
Finisterre, always setting out on the ¥camino¥, without a map or
agenda.  I am there already, just where i set out to be. 

       I was finally being a bit religious...about journaling in my
little sparkle book.  Then I found myself in the Pecos of Europe. 
Those mountains made me want to scream.  So beyond comment that my
little daily logs with little bitty words lost me.  I scaled one of
the canyons, 1200 meters (in the wildest parts of the Pyrenees would
have taken 4 hours),  that took me 8 hours!  Verticalisimo!  It has
been the finest weather of the year in these weeks, the whole time i
was in the ¥Peaks¥ (an understatement) not a drop fell from the sky. 
Thank you for your angels!     My favorite pilgrims wish of the week i
will borrow...®That you not get tired and continue happily®  (No te
canses y que sigas feliz hasta que llegues).

      Until always and always... love and liberty... go beyond, gin

<p>A woman came to the house looking for Jason, who went out with
Shane and someone else for the football game tonight.  The game
probably ended by 10pm; it's a high school football game.  They're
still not home even now at 2 am.</p>

<p>I invited her in and gave some input/ideas/etc from my standpoint
as a youth advisor and as an ex teenager.  This felt really weird to
me to be giving advice to a mom on how to raise her kid, not just
because I don't have kids, but because he is her 3rd of 4 kids.  How
can I give helpful advice to someone like that?  I dunno, but she
seemed quite appreciative of my insights.</p>

<p>She stayed for 30 minutes at least; Becky and Elizabeth came in
from the garage and extended the conversation to TV stations and
such.  Very interesting all the different aspects we have of our
lives.</p>

<p>I'm standing in a river now (across the street from Barbie's
house), only as deep as my lower calf on the left foot, standing on a
large fallen tree.  I'm using the uplifted roots as my computer table.
My right foot stands up out of the water on the tree, as if I
conquered it.</p>

<p>If by conquer I mean that I did not slip and fall into the water,
then yes, I conquered the tree.  The main reason I'm not across the
river by now is that I don't want to get wet.  And some trees have
teasingly fallen halfway across the river, on both sides but not at
the same point across the river.  I can wade through part of the water
through which I can see the bottom, but if I can't see the bottom, I
don't really want to walk there for fear that I will slip into a deep
hole and get my computer wet.  That would be bad.  Darn non-waterproof
computer..  hahaha</p>

<p>Okay, wish me luck.</p>

<p class=date>12:53pm</p>

<p>Wow.  I successfully navigated two different trees partway across
the river to a sandbar and back.  The first tree was a large um, tree
(darn my non-knowledge of tree types) slanted from the bank down into
the water.  Its bark wanted to slough off each time I stepped on it,
so I had to be supremely careful to keep from losing my footing.  Plus
I was wearing shoes, which made me a tad less balanced.</p>

<p>Ended up crouching on all fours like a silly looking hump backed
rabbit and made it to a point where I could look down and see the sand
through the water.  It looked like I could climb off the branch into
the water and not slip and not be too deep.</p>

<p>The trunk was high enough out of the water that I chose to face
backwards and sorta slide off it into the water.  Splash! up to my
lower shorts legs, but none on my phone or wallet which I have in my
pockets, and certainly none on my backpack or computer.</p>

<p>Walked slowly along the sandbar; the water was deeper than I had
guessed it would be.  (Hey maybe if I get a waterproof backpack that
would be a lot cheaper and allow me to swim across the river with all
my stuff.)  Did not discover a way across the river, but made it to
another much smaller tree trunk that would allow me passage back to
shore.  This trunk was partially submerged, and had a cool whirlpool
sometimes sucking leaves down under the trunk.  I could not see the
river bottom below this tree, so I walked super carefully across it,
balancing as best I could.  Balance was good enough to make it without
falling.  Oh, I had to psych myself out and play like it was a short
sturdy brick wall and an error would be easily recoverable.  This gave
me the courage to walk more quickly across the log and make it to
shore.</p>

<p>Put my legs on overdrive to clambor up the steep slope as dirt
sloughed off with each step.  Made it up to street level in a few
minutes.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Oh, I had found a golf ball earlier in my trek, which I bounced to
a kid on the street.  His name is Brian, and I had previously met him
as one of Shane's friends.  He had chosen to take the day off from
school today.</p>

<p>I forgot to mention that while we played the string game, Sarah
picked up the cat and tossed him onto my hand.  Funny stuff.</p>

<p>We went for a long walk today, which started as a run down the golf
course, basically chasing two guys in a golf cart for a while.  Each
time they would get out of their cart to hit some balls, I would have
Sarah stop so as to not intrude on their game.  Each time they would
take a practice swing, she would giggle and say "he missed it" and
then when he hit the ball she would say "oooh good hit!"  Funny.</p>

<p>We walked all the way to the front of the subdivision and then
walked across the tressel of the railroad track and heard a train
coming so we stepped off to the side (we were well past the tressel)
and waved to the engineer who waved back.</p>

<p>During the walk she kept saying, "I can't believe that I walked
this far!!!" and I invited her to test to see if she was dreaming by
trying to fly.  I wonder if she'll remember to test while she's
dreaming now and fly in her dream.</p>

<p>We headed back after feeding grass to the bravest of a heard of
cows, who were probably being wary of the electric fence in which they
were caged.  The fence was actually wooden, with one electrified wire
that Sarah accidentally touched and then somehow <em>somehow</em>
talked me in to touching.  Ow!!!!  That was pretty funny that she was
able to do that.</p>

<p>I piggybacked her about 1/4 of the way home, and she was asleep
soon after we got back.  Becky was getting pretty worried since it was
relatively dark by the time we got back.</p>

<p>Great great great stuff!</p>

<p>Just had a great conversation with my uncle Rick, who unfortunately
I will not be able to see this time since I didn't really plan ahead
as I left Memphis and I've ended up waiting here because I thought
Rachel and Hamidah were coming here and it's all just a silly
miscommunication problem.  But he still says comeon over any time I
want.  So awesome.  I'm sorry that I didn't plan ahead well
enough.</p>

<p>He told me about <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com">t-mobile</a>,
which apparently offers a tri-band phone that can be used all over the
world for $60/month or so.  I will certainly be getting a new phone
when I slide over to Japan next year.  I wonder if people will be able
to call a US number and get my in Japan.  And have my Japan peeps call
a Japanese number and get me in Japan, or the US.  That would be fly.
Or fuck the Japan vs US numbers and have a worldwide numbering system
(IP address, or better IPv6 address) to get to a particular phone.
Ultra fly.</p>

<p>I must be addicted to the internet.  Good job to Kate who has
decided to blow off livejournal and AIM for an unspecified period of
time.  It is just silly, but so goddamn addicting, and I can't really
figure out why.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Why is livejournal so interesting?  It's something about how it
lets me feel connected to these people's lives, how I can have some
insights on how they act around others, how I can maybe give some
helpful insight to them.</p>

<p>Now I'm reading my email and have been willing to wait wait wait
even though this internet connection is so fucking slow it's pathetic!
Damn this connection bites my butt.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Elizabeth and Becky are back in the garage, cleaning the place up.
They've really done an impressive job!</p>

<p>Why do people smoke?  Why can they be addicted to something that is
so obviously bad for them?  And why do cute girls smoke?  And guys for
that matter?  It's so fucking messed up.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>

<p>Wow!</p>

<p>Becky has just given me the greatest approval/blessing of my
grander adventure, saying that it's the greatest thing that anyone in
our family has ever done.</p>

<p>I don't know about all <em>that</em>, but I certainly appreciate
the thought.</p>

<p class=date>9:04am</p>

<p>Becky believes that once Fred is done with his education, he wants
to make a lot of money.  I disagree, but I'm writing it down for the
record..</p>

<p class=date>9:58am</p>

<p>Becky and I have just been engaged in conversation about God and
reality and life and death and consequences.  Good stuff.</p>

<p class=date>11:35am</p>

<p>Checked my email; didn't read livejournal.  I would like to plan
the rest of my trip, but the internet connection here seems pretty
slow to do it via mapquest.  I don't know of any atlases (atlii?) here
to let me look up distances between cities.  And no, I don't have any
maps.  Hmm. I wonder if there is a AAA office nearby-ish...  They will
give me free maps.</p>

<p class=date>12:41pm</p>

<p>Becky called Barbie to see how to get to AAA, but Barbie said it's
difficult and we'll get lost, so we're going to wait for Shane to get
home and he'll take me.  So now I'm going to go ride my bike around.</p>

<p>Rode my bike slowly around the neighborhood which is basically
meshed with a golf course that seems well manicured and well used.</p>

<p>Got to the front of the subdivision where the roadway goes under a
railroad tressel which goes over a river at the same point.  I took
the railroad tracks about 2.5 or 3 miles, assuming the posts numbered
"7" "8" and "9" were each a mile apart. </p>

<p>I wondered how far I could take them.  Which way am I going?  Where
would I end up?  If only I had a support system of, say, maps donated
by MapQuest, internet access donated by Kinko's, or maybe by some
company that provides internet access via satellite, a digital video
camera donated by someone, a GPS compass donated by someone...  I
think that would make a pretty marketable trek.  Oh, and food donated
by Ben & Jerry's.  Oh and maybe some food besides ice cream.</p>

<p>I mean, shit, I could put a camera on my helmet, one watching what
I'm watching and one watching my face as I ride.  I wonder if that
kind of bandwidth is available via satellite except for the
government.  Oh and one camera pointed behind me so no one could sneak
up on me since lots of peeps could know exactly where I was
located.</p>

<p>Okay.  So now I'm going to crack out these maps again and see what
I can figure out.</p>

<p class=date>1:36am</p>

<p>Okay, here are my estimated mileages between cities I plan to visit:</p>

<p>Barboursville, WV -&gt; Columbus, OH: 132 miles
<br>Columbus, OH  -&gt; Oberlin, OH: 130 miles
<br>Oberlin, OH -&gt; Kalamazoo, MI: 290 miles
<br>Kalamazoo, MI -&gt; Chicago, IL: 156 miles
<br>Chicago, IL -&gt; Bloomington, IL: 137 miles
<br>Bloomington, IL -&gt; Columbia, MO: 250 miles
<br>Columbia, MO  -&gt; Springfield, MO: 160 miles
<br>Springfield, MO -&gt; Tulsa, OK: 189 miles
<br>Tulsa, OK -&gt; OKC, OK: 3 hours
<br>OKC, OK -&gt; Dallas, TX: 3 hours
<br>Dallas, TX -&gt; San Antonio, TX: 4 hours</p>

<p>I wonder if I'll be able to squeeze in a day to visit Cedar
Point...</p>

<p class=date>11:10am EDT Friday 4 October 2002</p>

<p>Okay, I have confirmed that my estimates were pretty close to what
<a href="https://www.mapquest.com">Mapquest</a> suggests (I'm really
impressed with all that mapquest offers free of charge, and how
intuitive their interface is), and I've emailed my peeps in various
cities I plan to visit.  Going to go walk on the nearby mountain to
see what I can see.</p>

<p>An hour ago I was feeling sorta trapped here, needing to get moving
on my adventure.  Now I'm more relaxed that I have a plan.</p>
