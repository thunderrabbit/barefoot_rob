<p>Both phone conference calls were great today; minor
changes were requested, and most of them were made
immediately while we were still in conference.  The
client is quite pleased with the product and all kinds
of good stuff.</p>

<p>Karla is even buying me lunch at JCI -- baked
potato with crazy cheese.  (not a backed potato)</p>

<p>Discovered one error during the testing.  Actually
two.  One that is an actual bug, one that is a
business rule not being fully defined.  I'll fix the
bug; and it should be easy enough to fix the
other.</p>

<p>I'm feeling a ton better today than yesterday,
though I'm a bit tired now that I've been at work for
8 hours already.  But this system is going live
tomorrow.  I'll sleep tonight once it's done (and
after Dude and I take more underwater pics for
humanclock.com).</p>

&nbsp;<BR></BR></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Arial">Tragedy has shocked us
into an examination
of the way this nation of peace and freedom does
business in the world.
Terrorism used to happen in distant places. Now,
explosions of death
and destruction have rocked us to the core.
</FONT>&nbsp;<BR></BR></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Arial">Grief mingles with
fury. No country deserved
such an act of terrorism. Where is God now? Where is
Allah? Where is
Yhwh? Why don&rsquo;t they do
something?</FONT>&nbsp;<BR></BR></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Arial">A Sufi was praying when
along came a
cripple, a beggar and a victim of assault. And seeing
them, he cried,
&ldquo;Great God, how is it that a loving creator can see
such things and
yet do nothing about them?&rdquo; And God said, &ldquo;I did do
something. I made
you.&rdquo;</FONT>&nbsp;<BR></BR></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Arial">OK, God, what are we to
do now? Retaliate?
Assassinate? Give up our freedom? We expect some
combination of responses.
These attacks demand increased vigilance as well as a
strong show of
force. I am appalled that misguided vigilantes have
assaulted mosques,
Muslims, and anyone who resembles them. Still, our
trigger fingers are
ready to fire even while the other hand guards the
safety. We want to
find some middle ground between &ldquo;an eye for an eye&rdquo;
and &ldquo;turn the other
cheek.&rdquo; We want the world safe again for our children.
What can we do?</FONT>&nbsp;<BR></BR>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Arial">We have already begun
to take a hard
look at ourselves. How is it that someone thought this
was a good idea?
People hijacked multiple planes and deliberately
sacrificed themselves
in exchange for maximum civilian casualties. Why is it
that they hated
us so much, or felt so unheard, or had so little to
lose, that they
were willing to take such desperate measures?
</FONT>&nbsp;<BR></BR>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Arial">We have been way &ldquo;too
busy&rdquo; to pay much
attention to the world&rsquo;s people. Millions starve while
we grab a bite
to eat or dine in quiet elegance. Refugees flee to
crowded camps while
we crowd into concert halls and sports arenas. Cheap
labor overseas
keeps our prices down and dividends high. And we&rsquo;re
surprised that people
hate us?</FONT>&nbsp;<BR></BR></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Arial">Officially, we have
isolated ourselves
in dramatic ways: by walking out of the Middle East
peace process,
challenging the nuclear test ban, refusing to sign the
Kyoto Accord,
dropping out of the racism summit, withholding dues
from the United
Nations even though we expect its support. Perhaps we
should not be
so quick to walk away from international issues. Only
when we stay in
the struggle can we find win-win solutions to
extremely complicated
problems. </FONT>&nbsp;<BR></BR></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Arial">We may even have to
compromise.</FONT>&nbsp;<BR></BR>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Arial">An image I try to keep
in my mind is
our beautiful planet Earth shown against the immensity
of space. No
divisions can be seen, no nations, no races, no
wealth, no poverty.
Last week the explosions must have been visible from
space when citizens
from many countries lost their lives. Now citizens
from many countries
must find a way to reach across our divisions until we
root out the
sources of terrorism. This is too small a world for
indiscriminate hatred.
We can no longer pretend this is someone else&rsquo;s
problem.</FONT>&nbsp;<BR></BR>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Arial">I believe that
God/Allah/ Yhwh calls
us to the light of possible human cooperation and
compassion. The rest
of the world stands ready to help us determine a wise
course of action
as we seek a better world for all
people.</FONT>&nbsp;<BR></BR></P>

decisions.</FONT>&nbsp;<BR></BR>

<p>Lots of scary news going on.  Even so I was somehow
able to finish the changes for the survey which will
go live in a few hours.  What a wonderful compliment
to hear people so impressed with the site on both
phone calls today!!</p>

<p>Amazing that there are astronauts in space, we have
satellites around mars, professional sports games, me
all hoping the survey is flawless tomorrow, and a
fucking war going on all at once.</p>

<p>Jason from Wende's work just called for her.  It's eearly on her
day off.  She's at Maggie's though, for the night, so I gave him
Maggie's phone number.  I didn't think to have him call her cell phone
number.  So he had to wake up more people before getting to Wende.  I
wonder what is the problem at work?</p>

<p>How funny!  Today Jessie from KTRU called me around 3pm and left a
message asking if I could come early to the station.  I didn't get the
message because we were at <em>Zoolander</em>.  But(!) I did arrive at
the station early because I rode my bike there and wanted to leave
plenty of time cause I didn't know how long it would take.  Plus I
intended to ride slowly so I wouldn't get all muddy or sweaty.</p>

<p>I hadn't called Jessie, so she was thinking I hadn't gotten the
message (correct), and therefore probably wouldn't come in early, so
when I arrived, she was all, "oh! you did come in early." or something
like that and I had no idea why she cared, etc.  Anyway, I enjoyed
arriving home and listening to the message which tied the whole story
together like a Tarantino film.</p>

<p>KTRU was great fun today!  My theme was any band name/album
name/song title that had to do with fire/heat/light/electricity/red.
Pretty broad list, but just broad enough that I completed the show
having met that theme for each song, <em>*except*</em> the very first
song called "Rob walks in" which I egotistically played because I had
just walked in.</p>

<p>Thanks to Ken who gave me the idea of "fire" for a theme.  :-)</p>

<p>Thanks to Eric/Maggie/Wende/Meredith/John for listening and calling
in to the show!  I played "Hello Maggie" or some song title with
Maggie in it for her, and Negativeland for old times sake.  Kim at the
dorms like Negativeland a long time ago.</p>

<p>The coolest call though, was from a woman who asked about the song
I was playing.  Her area code was neither 713/281/832 (the Houston
area codes), so I asked if she was calling from out of town.  She
wasn't; she was just on an out-of-town cell phone.  Then I commented
that she sounded like my DJ friend Alexis, who trained me way back
when I first DJed at KTRU.  She was not Alexis, "but I know the Alexis
that you're talking about."</p>

<p>How cool!!  So I'm going to email Alexis and tell her HI from
Karla.  Quite a lovely coincidence.</p>

<p>I was so pleased with the Alexis-connection, that I wanted to play
a song by an artist whose named contained the word "linky" or
"monkey," but I could find none. (Back in the day, Alexis expressed
how much she loved words which included the "nk" sound; she was <em>so
cute</em> saying "linky, linking, linky, linky, monkey, monkey, linky,
monkey," at our DJ meetings!!)  Instead I played a song from one of
the earliest CDs I reviewed, since Alexis was still at the station
back in those days.  :-)</p>

<p>I bicycled home relatively quickly, just to see how speedily I
could negotiate the wacky sidewalks at high speed in the (relative)
dark.  Pretty speedy.  I did one really cool manuever, but I don't
remember it now.</p>

<p>Fun at Ultimate today, although I got there barely in time.  I was
watching a clock that is slow by 30 minutes and got there after the
game had started and we were down 1 to 2.  Then we were down 1 to 3,
and then we just came back and were up 6 to 4 at the halftime.  Maybe
6 to 3 even.  We won the game 11 to 6, giving away the last 2 points
near the end of the game.</p>

<p>Our chant for their team after the game:</p>
<pre>
The Chicken Huckers have a ball,
October 13th, at The Pub, y'all.
The Chicken Huckers have a call,
Bwak bwak bwak bwak! That's all!
</pre>

<p>Next week or so our team is going to go visit a Haunted House,
maybe on Friday the 19th.</p>

<p>We went to see <em>Zoolander</em> today, and I describe it as goofy
and funny.  So much of it was just so <em>wrong</em> in a funny way
that I can hardly explain.  The one scene I didn't like depicted an
orgy focused around one woman, but at least they made it more funny
than sexy.  The funniest scene was "The Showdown" between the two
stars, and featured David Bowie as the judge.  Quite hilarious.</p>

<p>Tons and tons of cameos, all listed as actors and actresses playing
"himself" and "herself" in the credits.  I didn't notice/recognize
most of the names; I was busy looking at "himself" and "herself,"
thinking, "wow, that's a lot of cameos.  I wonder who they all were?"
But by then they had scrolled away.</p>

<p>I'm slightly ashamed that I didn't recognize Milla Jovovich, who
played the bad Russian woman.</p>

<p>Lonngg day at work but oh so productive. Got all
the shit fixed for the latest big project and will be
ready for about 6 hours of phone calls that we have
scheduled for Monday and Tuesday mornings.</p>

<p>Did a slightly cool javascript form thing, setting
the value of a dropdown list to the last item in the
list ("other") if and only if the user enters anything
in the 'other' textbox.</p>
