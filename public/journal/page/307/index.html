<p>I had a different/unexpected success today in Japanese class.  I
  was doing some grammar drills on some new grammar that seemed really
  difficult and I was like grrr and I reallllly thought あやな must be
  bored as fuck and that she was really patient with me and I could
  hardly believe it when she was like, "good job" and I was like "yeah
  right," but she kept it up and I was beginning to wonder if maybe I
  really was doing a good job (this is a huge point for me to learn as
  a teacher; I'm not good at saying good job if it's not as good as I
  hope, even if it's a good effort) and ANYWAY the point is あやな
  said がんばって and it made me feel better. Wow; how amazing is
  that?  I chugged on and got through the exercises.</p>

<p>ps: soon as I learn the lesson she'll teach next week, I'll be able
  to explain in Japanese that she said gambatte (in Japanese).
  Nice.</p>

<p>Hung out with みき immediately after my work. Met up with her in
  Azalea and we walked to Cinecitta area (and saw / were seen by Phil
  along the way (eee)) and sat together on the steps (in the cold) to
  watch two water fountain performances.</p>

<p>She brought a tangerine, which she called a みかん, but which some
  cat on the web says is not an exact translation; maybe there isn't a
  name for precisely what we call a tangerine.  Anyway, fuck that; we
  ate it and watched the water thing and had fun yammering about
  nothing and everything else.</p>

<p>She was a bit congested, so I suggested we send her home or go
  someplace warmer.  Went to Starbucks and had hot cocoa and more
  tangerines and a chocolate chip scone.</p>

<p>She caught the last bus home (luckily; we just left when Starbucks
  closed and walked to the bus stop and bang the first bus that came
  was the last bus that was gonna come tonight) and I fell asleep on
  the train on the way home.  Missed 武蔵小杉 by two stations.  Made
  it back to 小杉 before 12:30 which is basically when the last train
  comes that will go all the way to 綱島。</p>

<p>Called みき after work and she hung out with me a bit (I think she
  was on the way home when I called) and I carefully watched /
  monitored my actions and mental responses to see what exactly is
  attractive about this situation.</p>

<p>My gut feeling is that I miss physical touch.</p>

<p>I'm just rotting in my room.</p>

<p>Anything on my computer seems easier than studying.</p>

<p>Good news is I just got 133 on an IQ test.   (I got 135 the first
  time I took it, which seems a lot higher, but oh well)</p>

<p>The bad news is that my JQ isn't getting any higher.  And I want
  to write about my conversation with janette last night where we
  analyzed my relationship patterns and tried to see why I'm never
  satisfied with what relationship I've got.</p>

<p>"It's a complete nightmare; I am always looking.  I never stop
  looking."  I'm always looking for another woman who will be better
  than the one I've got.  When I don't have a girlfriend I'm looking
  for a girlfriend.  When I have a girlfriend I'm looking for a
  better girlfriend.   This has never fucking stopped since high
  school.  I continually look for a problem with each woman I meet to
  get her off my list of possible girlfriends.  I spend all my energy
  on this.  Nightmare.</p>

<p>Logically I know I'm looking for something that must come from
  within me.  Thing is, I don't know what I'm looking for.  Some kind
  of connection with infinity and unending love.</p>

<p>grar (as Jackie would say)</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>okay okay. I'm reaching into my memory that said I could see the
  value of studying Japanese, and I could see the possibility of
  learning Japanese, and remembering the angst I felt after I didn't
  study Japanese, and the pride I felt after I studied Japanese and
  got positive strokes (from women) after I used Japanese correctly.</p>

<p>Study now.</p>

<p>(where is the part where I'm studying for my own benefit?)</p>

<p>Man, the titles today could be songs on a nin album</p>

<p>Called janette; pounced on her when I got an email proving she was
  still awake.  She was surprised to hear from me.  More huge
  honesty; I told her that I just want to <em>BITE</em> みき, like a
  vampire just smurf her and be done (*).  But since I can't do that, I'm
  pawing at her, the way I did with inaccessible women while I was in
  Dallas.  <! Chez Pafford, Jackie Purdy></p>

<p>HUGE sadness on the phone.  This was my best cry in Japan so far.
  Reached that point of vibrational connection with my higher spirit;
  a truly cleansing cry.  Close connection with janette; didn't want
  to let her go after that.</p>

<p>(*) smurf has a meaning that I can't explain; I don't have the
  language for it (not even in Japanese).  This is a point that Wende
  didn't understand when I tried to explain it one day.  janette says
  she understands.   interesting, that.</p>

<p>I cried subbingly uncontrollingly; just let it all go in heaving
  gasps "I &lt;sob> can't &lt;sob> do &lt;sob> this."</p>

<p>Once I was in a pattern of two words between sobs; it would be
  good in a movie to see that a few times.  Pretty funny.</p>

<p>Feeling *much* better now.  Even if I'm not any more likely to
  study today.  Except I'll probably practice some with なおみ at
  Tokyo Tower today.</p>

<p>Oh - janette told me that a psychic did my reading and said, "I
  don't know what he's going t to, but whatever he does will be
  magnificent."  Wow.  I have heard this about four timtes from
  different psychics, and Ithis time I was like beyond the need to
  know wtf it is I'm going to do.  I'm just like, "okay' sounds great"
  but I'm just here living my life and we'll see what comes up.
  Trusting that it will come and that these people are right.</p>

<p>janette said she really hated when I pawed back in Dallas.  She
  said I was giving away my power.  I hoped janette was going tosay
  something like, she actually liked it, but that was not the case.
  Oh, she said I really gave away

and I was like I have so much energy, whcih I have explaressed to
  Wende asw well.  So much energy and sometoiemses oftentimes I don't
  know what to do with it all.  I can hardly keep my legs from
  bouncing; I can hardly stand still on an escalator; I can never sit
  on all fours in the classroom in Nova; I am alswas moving always
  running up the stairs.  go go go go go.  Am I chasing or running?
  both?  is that possible?   My train is about to come; gotta jet.</p>

<p>peace</p>

<br>you thought i was going to say that i liked it when you pawed at women?<br>
 wha&hellip;???<br>
here&rsquo;s something else i do not like to read. &ldquo;always&rdquo;  &ldquo;i always look for someting better.&rdquo;<br>
 does that mean you are not allowing for the possibility that   someday this behavior pattern can change?<br>
&ldquo;i am never satisfied.&rdquo; <br>
  are you locking yourself into a pattern with your constant negetive reinforcement?<br>
  i would like to hear that you are recognizing aspects of your life so far with which you are not happy and that you have the will,the intention, the power, the grace, the divine help, the flow of the universe, to change for the better.<br>
  and the support and faith of a fellow traveler who will not accept &ldquo;never&rdquo; and &ldquo;always&rdquo; from you.<br></p>

<p>Had big fun hanging with Naomi after visiting Tokyo Tower.  She is
  an elevator operator there, which incluldes not only operating
  elevators, but today, greeting people at the top of the tower and
  asking them to step to the right out of the elevator.  I was like,
  "Hi Naomi"  when she saw me.</p>

<p>Because she works there, we got to visit the mystery art place free
  of charge, and she took picture with her disposable camera.  They
  were like optical illusiuory pictures with varying degrees of
  illusionicity.</p>

<p>She showed me a lot of different uildings at the top of  from the
  top of the tower and then we went to the illusion place and then
  rocked out of there in search of food.  Got two guitar pins for
  Bryn at Hard Rock Cafe (one 50% off from early 2003 and one this
  year for Christmas 2003 (city included, year included)  and then we
  stopped in a bookstore where I saw a translated version of a book
  called <em>Alice in Wonderland and the disaster at   World Trade
  Center Disaster: Why the official story of 9/11 is a monumental
  lie</em> and sent to janette via email (via my phone!!) the
  title..  I have no idea if it's a good book or not.</p>

<p>Then we chowed at an upscale Denny's calibre restaurnat and I
  didn't feel the least bit like I didn't know how to act in a
  Japanese restaurnat cuase we were cutting up and doing (subtle) see
  food games and such.  First ime in Japan for me for that.  yaya!</p>

<p>Um, then we oh, we went to a game center and took funny pictures
  in the picture booth; that I think I'll put online, but I might
  have to in a super secret place  - heck I dunno  Oh, I can put them
  on my bbst.  money.</p>

<p>UmmmmmmmmThen we headed home and I dropped her off (we rode the
  train, but) at Kawasaki, and now I'm on the Nambu line to head home.</p>

<p>Tons of fun and tons of Japanese including but not limited to:</p>

<p>wats</p>

<p>watashi no ie wa tsunashima eki aruite 8fun kurai desu</p>

<pre>
kono densha wa atono densha chisai risomething des
this is not in ps I think
 those were the most valuable ones that I remember.

oh also wakata oiete kudasai.  I think that's right.  good stuff mate.

oh and shimarimas and  m  the opposit  hirakimas I think.

There is a guy on this train bein g super loud and drunk I assume,
but he's with his friends and they are all shhh ing him to nlow
avail.   the women in front of my are gossipping quietly andmi
including lots of neeeeee annd unnnn   and neeeee  and  nnnnnnnn  and
such.  funny, but normal for them.

normal for them, but natural for me.


okay I hope nothing else super noteworthy happens or that I get homne
quickly; I'm closing my computer now and it doesn't hink it has

<p>I typed a lot of this with the screen off, and then I never
  checked it.  I'm still going to post it; I'm too tired to futz with
  it now and I dunno if I'll ever edit it.</p>

<p>HI.</p>

<p>こんにちわ。</p>

<p>The construction next to us has officially impressed me now.  The
  gray tower is suddenly tall and the crane can inchworm its way up
  and down the tower which has large (12 inch-ish) holes through which
  pins are placed to hold the crane in place.</p>

<p>Erik pointed out part of the assembly that I didn't notice before
  (the part that holds the crane above the inchworm part looked to me
  like the tower itself at first), and now it has all become clear.
  Wow.</p>

<p>Yahoo, jack!  Phong was willing to work my last three lessons today
  so I can go see Nami's tap recital!</p>

<p>I offered him 9000 yen on the spot to cover the three lessons,
  which is a bit more than I'll make for them, but I don't care.</p>

<p>The recital better be good. haha</p>
