<p>I just woke up.  My plan to move out still feels good.  I'm going
to Kinko's to place an ad in Houston Press or Greensheet today.  I
figure I can always turn everyone down if I decide this is a bad idea.</p>

<p>I just realized I need to call Maggie and have her write an
Academic Referral for me to send to Nova.  I called Dr Bao to have him
write one, but when he called me back, he said he remembered who I
was, but didn't remember anything else.  It has been 9 years, and he
is careful to learn the names of every student in every class he
teaches.  At some point yesterday I realized Maggie could write an
academic referral, but I didn't think to call her right at that
moment.  Weird.</p>

<p>So now I just asked Maggie for <em>another</em> huge favor: write
me an academic referral and have it done by noon when Diana and I come
see her for lunch.  I'm so thankful for Maggie's brilliance; I know
she'll write an excellent referral.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I have a big question mark in my brain on what will be Wende's
reaction to all this.  She's been out of town for the past 3 weeks in
San Francisco (for work), so she doesn't know of my sudden shift in
plans.  My hope is that she is fully supportive; there is a part of me
that would let her talk me out of this.</p>

<p>I'm chillin' outside Japan-America Society of Houston before my
Japanese class starts at 6:30.  This is the first class I will attend
that's supposed to be on my level.  Someone just walked up.</p>

<p class=date>6:07pm</p>

<p>Now I'm <em>inside</em> the office.  Nice.</p>

<p class=date>6:08pm</p>

<p>Sooooo challenging.  I have missed two classes, so this is the
third class, *and* the other students are reading romanji.  I feel
really slow when I am stumbling through reading.  Part of the
challenge is to figure out what page we are on, and what exercise we
are on; I have to use pictures from other people's books to figure out
the page, and then listen to other's reading to see what exercise we
are on and then when it comes to my turn, hopefully have figured out
what to do.  :-)</p>

<p class=date>8:56pm</p>

<p>Aw dammit.  After class I checked my phone messaages and realized I
had missed a movie with Daniel.  I'm really embarassed that I forgot
about it.  The date was not listed in my calendar; I don't know what I
was thinking when I told him I'd meet him, but didn't write it
down/check my calendar.</p>

<p>Class was quite challenging.  I think a helpful thing would be for
me to know the hiragana even better.  I'll practice them during the
week.  Right now I'm going to work on Kim Sawyer's website.</p>

<p>Kristen is supposed to call me later tonight.</p>

<p class=date>9:10pm</p>

<p>Now I'm at Kinko's.  There's a guy beside me typing with two
fingers.  If he turns to a page of a large amount of prose, I will
offer to help.</p>

<p>Maggie and I are at lunch, without Diana, and I feel a bit
embarassed about that because I didn't confirm the exact time to meet
Diana to come up and see Maggie.</p>

<p>It just seemed so simple; I thought Diana said she would be at home, and I
called her at 11am (because she didn't reply to my email earlier in
the morning) and she had already left to come to lunch with u.</p>

<p>???</p>

<p>I wondered where she thought she was going to meet us.  I went over
to my apartment complex and talked a bit with Andrea who is moving down to
another apartment, but no sign of Diana.  I called her house again
(and woke up whoever answered the phone again) and left my number.</p>

<p>Maggie and I have been recalling college days stories, focusing on
Danielle who Maggie gets to see in August!</p>

<p>I have just gotten new handwritten business cards made.  I scanned
them, but forgot to keep a copy of the scanned image, so I don't have
an image for my site yet.</p>

<p>The top says 'Meet people. Get in adventures.' which is a quote
from Pulp Fiction.  Down one side (the T side below) it says 'The
adventure begins with you.'  and up the other side (the w side below)
it says www.robnugen.com and rob@robnugen.com</p>

<p>I'm getting 500 copies made.</p>

<p>Just heard from Daniel; he razzed me a bit but was less concerned
than I was.  Ironic that Diana missed a date with me, and I missed a
date with Daniel, all in one day.</p>

<p>Just before ASL, I was working on Kim's <a
href="https://www.spiritblueeagle.com">personal website</a>, and
discovered that I haven't worked on it for 6 months, and could
arguably owe him the equivalent of $4800 work on his site.  (We're
bartering personal coach time for website development)</p>

<p>Anyway, I spent about 1 hour trying to get 1 thing to work
correctly and finally did.  It took a while to track down since I
don't have access to the cgi logs, and stupid internet explorer wasn't
reloading the page from the internet even though I told it to reload
every time, and I was clicking refresh.  Stupid IE.  I had to clear
the cache each time I wanted to refresh the page I was working on.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>ASL was fun, especially at the end when it was just Chuck, Ima, and
me talking.  We learned that Chuck lives in a 120 year old 12 room
house featuring 2 ghosts, one of which Chuck has never seen nor
experienced, but other people have.</p>

<p>After Chuck left, I was chillin' with Ima until her twin Eka came
to pick her up.  Ima asked me about my religious beliefs (the first
night we had ASL together she had invited me to her church picnic
thing, but I turned her down, having assumed it would be some variety
of a Christian/biblical based religion) and I was telling her what I
believed and such..  the conversation started when she asked about why
I was choosing to go on such an adventure and just leave stuff behind,
and I told her I believe God would provide for me.  "Oh, you believe
in Him?" was her reaction.  Of course I do.</p>

<p>I just don't believe God requires anything of us in order for us to
be loved and allowed to chill with him when we're not in physical form.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Eka arrived and we were all talking a bit.  I was thankful for how
respectful they were of my beliefs.  Most other times that I've been
in a similar conversation, the person who was not me would interrupt
me a lot.  I thanked them for allowing me to speak un-interrupted.</p>

<p>My phone interrupted us twice though.  Maggie and Marta each called
me.  I called Maggie back, but I haven't called Marta back yet.</p>

                        <p class=date>10:32am CDT Tuesday 25 June 2002</p>

<p>Today is my first day off with basically nothing scheduled; no one
to report to except myself and Spot.</p>

<p>I started out in a great deal of fear that almost paralyzes me, but
then I sat with my list of things and called some people and such.
The interesting thing I discovered in my mind is the similarity I see
between my situation now and when I left Telecheck with $10,000 in my
bank account some years ago.</p>

<p>This time I don't have $10,000, but the key feature is this:  back
then I was afraid to leave my apartment and until recently I couldn't
figure out why.  Now I realize it's this (and was probably this back
then): fear that I'll lose touch with my friends.</p>

<p>In my scared mind, it works like this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I tell my friends I'll be at this address through the end of
2002 (this I've already done)</p></li>
<li><p>I move out before the end of 2002</p></li>
<li><p>My friends send letters and <em>whoops!</em> where's Rob?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This three step scenario severely underestimates my friends.  They
will forgive me if I move; they will be willing to update address
books before the end of 2002.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>So now my list of tasks has shifted slightly.  I am allowing myself
to be open to the possibility of moving out sooner than December.  I
will now allow my higher self to speak to me through runes.</p>

<p>I'll let you know what I find out.</p>

<p>Oh, I just called Karla and asked her to write a reference letter
for me to Nova.  She'll ask Kevin as well, but he was on the phone.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p><em>The issue is my apartment</em></p>

<p>Overview: Hagalaz (Disruption, Elemental Power, Hail)</p>

<blockquote><p>Change, freedom, invention and liberation are all attributes of
this Rune.  Drawing it indicates a pressing need within the psyche to
break free from constricitng identification with material reality and
to experience the world of archetypal mind.</p>

<p>The Rune of elemental disruption, of events that seem to be totally
beyond your contorl, <em>Hagalaz</em> has only an upright position,
and yet always operates through reversal.  When you draw this Rune,
expect disruption, for it is the Great Awakener, although the form the
awakening takes my vary.  Perhaps you will experience a gradual
feeling of coming to your sense, as though you are emerging from a
deep sleep. Then again, the onset of poer may be such as to rip away
the fabric of what you previously knew as your reality, your security,
your understanding of yourself, your work, your relationships or
beliefs.</p>

<p>Disruption takes many forms: a relationship fails, plans go awry, a
source of supply dries up.  But do not be dismayed.  Wheter you
created the disruption, or whether it comes from an outside source,e
you are not without power in theis situation.  Your inner strengh, the
will you have funded until now in your life provides support and
guidandce at a time when everything you've taken for granted is being
challenged.</p>

<p>Another of the Cycle Runes, the term <em>radical discontinuity</em>
best describes the action of <em>Hagalaz</em> at its most forceful.
The more severe the disruption in your life, the more significant and
timely the requirements for your growth.  The universe and you own
sould are demanding that you do, indeed, grow.</p></blockquote>

<p>Challenge: Fehu (Possessions, Nourishment, Cattle) <em>reversed</em></p>

<blockquote><p><b>Reversed:</b> There may be considerable frustration
in your life if you draw <em>Fehu Reversed</em>, a wide range of
dispossessions ranging from trivial to severe.  You fall short in your
efforts, you reach out and miss; you are compelled to stand by and
watch helplessly while what you've gained dwindles away.  Observe what
is happening.  Examing these events from an open perspective and ask,
"What do I need to learn from this in my life?"</p>

<p>Even if there is occasion for joy, do not let yourslef be seduced
into mindless joyousness.  Reversed, this Rune indicated that doubtful
situations are abundant and come in many forms and guises.  Here you
are being put in touch with your shadow side of possessions.  Yet all
this is part of coming to be and passing away, and not that which
abides.  In dealing with the shadow side of <em>Fehu</em>, you have an
opportunity to recognize where your true nourishment
lies.</p></blockquote>

<p>Timely Action: Inguz (Fertility, New Beginnings, Ing, the Hero
God)</p>

<blockquote><p>This Rune is akin to the moon, the intuitive part of
our nature, with its urge toward harmonizing and adjusting in the
sphere of personal relationships.  <em>Inguz</em> embodies the need to
share, the yearing to be desired, a search after similarities.</p>

<p><em>The completion of beginnings</em> is what <em>Inguz</em>
requires.  Drawing this Rune may mark a time of joyful deliverance, of
new life, a new path.  A Rune of great power, receiving it means that
you now have the strength to achieve completion, resolution, from
which comes a new beginning.  Above all, completion is crucial here.
It may be timely that you complete some project now; if so, make that
your first priority.  Perhaps a difficult state of mind can be
clarified or resolved.  The appearance of this Rune indicates that you
must fertilize the ground for your own deliverance.</p>

<p>All things change and we cannot live permanently amid
obstructions.  <em>Inguz</em> signals your emegence from a closed,
chrysalis state.  As you resolve and clear away the old, you will
experience a release from tension and uncertainty.</p>

<p>You may be required to free yourself from a rut, habit or
relationship; from some deep cultural or behavioral pattern, some
activity that was quite proper to the self you are leaving behind.
The time of birth is always a critical one.  Movement can involve
danger, and yet movement that is timely leads out of danger.  The time
has come to enter the delivery room.</p>

<p>Another of the Cycle Runes, <em>Inguz</em> counsels preparation.
Being centered and grounded, freeing yourself from all unwanted
influences and seeing the humor, you are indeed prepared to open to
the Will of Heaven and await your deliverance with calm
certainty.</p></blockquote>

<p>Wow.  What a pile of words.  I don't feel any more clear on what
would be helpful.  I shall sit meditatively for a moment.  It's
11:20am.</p>

<p class=date>11:57am</p>

<p>I spent 20 minutes looking through my journal entries from late
1998 and early 1999; it seems that the times I was *excited* were
times associated with travel.  That seems to be the answer to my
current question/introspective situation.  So I called Lee-eh to let
her move to my apartment (actually at that moment I offered to let her
live with me roommate wise, thereby reducing my rent.  But now I'm
more likely to just move out), and left a message with her.  I called
Jason, but he is already committed to moving into his mom's ex house
in Clear Lake.</p>

<p>Hey Kristen, do you want to live in my apartment?</p>

<p>I'm at Mission Burritos and Dude has just arrived.</p>

<p class=date>1:01pm</p>

<p>Brainstorming with Amy now.</p>

<p>I'm basically considering leaving my apartment and moving into my
car and visiting people and such.  I need a permanent address (dad's
house); I'll give my furniture to anyone who will take over the lease;
I just need to tell Gen X and send Spot somewhere...</p>

<p>Cost of gas will go up; cost of rent will go down.</p>

<p>How many places can I legitimately stay?  Friends' houses,
campsites, side of road...</p>

<p>My bank account is already electronic; there is no brick and mortar
place to go.  I should get more deposit slips.</p>

<p>How to keep my clothes?</p>

<p>What I choose not to release: end table that I made in 9th grade,
marble track, diaries, yearbooks, scrap books, pictures, old letters,
maybe more.</p>

<p class=date>1:31pm</p>

<p>I'm back at home; I greatly appreciate Amy's time spent
brainstorming with me.  She had to split to work on a slideshow for
her sister's wedding this Saturday.</p>

<p class=date>5:15pm</p>

<p>I am back at home after having visited Kinko's free internet
access.  Ryan McCarthy showed up randomly and we talked for a bit.  He
is depressed and has no job nor direction in his life.  I gave him
some suggestions and we discussed different options that we have.</p>

<p>I had been working on Kim Sawyer's website, but I got too cold at
Kinko's at came home.</p>

<p>Talked to Sylvia at the apartment front desk to see about my
options for moving out.  They will charge 85% of 1 month's rent if
they find a replacement for me.  If I find someone to move in and have
them sign a notarized thing accepting responsibility for the
apartment, then I pay nothing extra.</p>

<p>Jodi (me and Wende's house sale real estate agent) complimented my
bravery for choosing this option, saying I am "choosing to be
homeless." Yep, that's what I'm choosing.</p>

<p>Awake now and going to Dennis' work to work a bit.  I don't know
how much work he'll have for me, but I'm thankful for the
opportunity.</p>

<p>Now that my budget is up to date, I'll soon lay out a plan for the
next several months finances.</p>

<p class=date>8:39am</p>

<p>Wow.  I just discovered a Dr Seuss mountain at the core of this
stalk of celery!</p>

<p class=date>4:31pm</p>

<p>I have just worked 7 hours at Dennis' work; finished organizing the
binders for him.</p>

<p>Called John to see if Jason and I can work as cable monkeys for
him, pulling CAT 5 cable through ceilings and such.  Left a message.</p>

<p>Returned the Linksys wireless router to MicroCenter since Dude got
the original one working somehow.</p>

<p class=date>5:36pm</p>

<p>I'm chillin' in our room before my I-group meeting.  Found out that
my next Japanese class will be on Wednesday.  There are actually two
classes at the same time.  I get to choose which class I want to
attend although it's not clear to me now how I will make the decision
then.  It seems arbitrary now.</p>

<p>I called Steve Feinstein, who will write a referral letter to Nova
for me.  I will email him tonight to indicate what the letter should
highlight.</p>

<p>Tonight in I-group, I will brainstorm some different jobs I can
get.</p>

<p class=date>5:45pm</p>

<p>:-)  I can listen to Beastie Boys while I type!</p>

<p class=date>8:36pm</p>

<p>Took a bit of a nap before I-group.  During group we brainstormed
some good stuff for me to do income-wise.</p>

<p>I'm super thankful for their time and help.</p>

<p>Now I'm at Dude's after talking with Maggie a bit.  She heard from
Christine recently, which is surprising after so many years of non
contact.  Christine is celebrating a baby shower soon!  I know she'll
be a great mom and all that.</p>

<p>Daniel Edwards also called me tonight; we're going to see
<em>Minority Report</em> on Wednesday!  Whooooo!</p>

<p class=date>2:18am Tuesday 25 June 2002</p>

<p>Doh. I got somewhat sidetracked and didn't finish all the things I
wanted to to tonight, but I got most of them done.  I am too tired now
to do them.  (Update agendas for investment club meeting, look up Dr
Chisolm's phone number)</p>

<p>Chatted with Phat Pat and Colleen tonight.  Fun stuff.</p>

<p>Last night after the movie at Dude's I fell asleep while scp was
copying my entire website from robnugen.com to this machine for
archival purposes.  The only silly thing is that it copied multiple
times directories and files that were symlinks to one another.  So I
have multiple copies of my entire public_html folder and of my images
folder, which was included in my public_html folder, blah blah blah.
But I have a copy of the whole thing.  I prune it and tar it and throw
it on a CD...  maybe I won't tar it.</p>

<p>I was so tired last night that I left my computer at Dude's at 5am
when I left.  I got home to write a tired-version of the paragraph
above and discovered why my backpack had been so light.</p>

<p>My dad is coming over in a few minutes to have a Rob and Dad day 1
week after Father's day.</p>

<p>My dad came over around noon today to hang out.  We munched at
Hobbit Cafe and then went to see Scooby Doo movie.  Pretty funny.
Especially funny is what we thought was most funny: the burp and fart
contest by Shaggy and Scooby!  Hilarious if you think burp and fart
contests are hilarious.</p>

<p>Hung out a bit more at my apartment after grocery shopping and now
he's gone back home.  We'll likely have another Rob and Dad day around
his birthday in September.</p>
