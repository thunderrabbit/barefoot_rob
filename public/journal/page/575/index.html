<p>I just signed Wende and I up for Spanish classes through <a
href="https://www.llu.com">Leisure Learning Unlimited</a>!  It's my
intention that we be able to speak Spanish well before we visit Costa
Rica in 2002.  PLUS, this will be my Thing To Learn this year, or
something like that.  Last year I learned how to ride a unicycle.
This year I'll learn Spanish.  Awwww yeah.</p>

<p>I'm just about to leave work.  Today I pulled and
terminated four CAT 5 cables for our new web servers
that will be up and running soonishly.  That's pretty
much all I did work-wise.</p>

<p>For YRUU, I put Houston Rally registration forms
online so youth can register for the rally to be held
12-14 January 2001.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I will visit the laundry mat to wash the
guest bedroom comforter to remove the 50 pounds of cat
hair that it has collected.  The special occassion for
washing the comforter?  Wende is hosting a baby shower
at our house tomorrow night.</p>

<p>She has done tons of work cleaning the house.  I
(jokingly) told her I would have to move out so it
could stay clean.</p>

<p>We will probably go see a movie tonight.  Either
<em>CastAway</em> or <em>Miss Congeniality</em>.</p>

<p class=dream>Wende had braces.  She just suddenly got them as a
present to me.  So nice.  She had colored wires in them as well, to
make them more decorative.</p>

<p class=date>9:31pm CST Thursday 28 December 2000</p></p>

<p>Souper Salad with Maggie, Molly, Will, and Wende was great fun.
The funny stories:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>18 years ago, while presents were being opened on Christmas
morning, a [putt putt putt putt putt] sound could be heard on the
video.  The camera panned over to Wende's niece Melanie, then 1 year
old, sitting against the wall and cutting the world record longest
fart of 45 seconds, with a big smile on her face that said, "I'm
getting all the attention!"</p></li>

<li><p>Kim S, Laura's spades partner from college days so dismayed
each week at how <em>not funny</em> "Family Circus" was in the
newspaper comics.  And describing in great detail how it
<em>could</em> be funny, if they would just do this, or change
that.</p>

<p>"Well, Kim, you don't have to read it."</p>

<p>"I can't help it!  It's just right there and I keep thinking that
maybe this week it will be funny!"</p></li>

<li><p>Maggie describing how she wanted their cat Mischief to get to
sleep under the covers with them last night: Maggie and John had to
switch sides because John didn't want to sleep next to the cat for
safety reasons.  Then John thought Maggie was too hot, so he kept
scooting away from her.  Maggie thought she was cold and kept scooting
toward John, and Mischief just happily moved into the newly available
space!  Finally Maggie caught up with John, "John-honey, how are you?"
"I'm totally hot and you've got me squished so I can't move."</p></li>

<li><p>Maggie's niece who has several uncles, but just one aunt
(Maggie), said with such love and seriousness, "I love you, uncle
Maggie."</p></li>

</ul>

<p class=date>6:48pm CST Thursday 28 December 2000</p></p>

<p>Today seemed quite productive and fun.  Wende and I visited the
Federal Building downtown to get her passport, but they said she had
to wait until 14 days before her trip.  Very odd.</p>

<p>Then we zipped down to the courthouse, where I turned in my
Defensive Driving paperwork and stuff.  That was super painless
compared to what I expected as a worst case scenario.  I didn't have
to pay any $$ and I only had to talk with one person, and didn't have
to wait in any lines!</p>

<p>At work, I got most of the transformation from Stupid Project to
Cool Project done.  I gave a copy of the code to Kevin and Patrick to
make sure that I'm not missing anything.</p>

<p>Did I mention that I'm considering making a Shockwave version of my
journal?  I am.  I'm not considering it as seriously as I'm
considering updating the current perl-driven HTML version.  In this
version I may incorporate &lt;div> tags, and may update the way the
index is displayed.  Don't expect any apparent changes before 2001
arrives.</p>

<p>Today Molly has been an absolute fabulous help to Wende.  They
cleaned the house in a most amazing manner in preparation for Wende
hosting a baby shower for one of her co-workers.  My job is to clean
the upstairs shower.</p>

<p>I would really like to help keep the house cleaner than I have.
Wende and I are often at odds on this issue.  It's no secret that she
does a lot more cleaning and tidying around the house than I do.  And
it is a secret that I really do want to want to live in a clean house,
but I guess I don't want to enough to do anything about it.  Maybe
today will mark the big change.</p>

<p>Soon the gang is coming over so we can all go eat!</p>

<p class=date>8:16am CST Wednesday 27 December 2000</p></p>

<p>At around 4am this morning Spot was meowerlin' outside our bedroom
door, so I went out and petted him and sat on the couch with him for
about an hour.  He purrred a ton of appreciation.  Back in my
apartment, Spot got to sleep in the bed each night (if he was home).
Wende doesn't like having the cats sleep with us; they keep her
awake.</p>

<p>Just now I ran downstairs to take the trash out so it would be
picked up, but we missed the pick-up time.  This is the second week
we've missed it.  Maybe next week (next year) I'll remember to take it
out the night before.</p>

<p>It's almost 2001.  Pretty cool, but not as cool as the calendar
change from 1999 to 2000.</p>

<p>emacs is working to remove the sixteenth ring.</p>

<p class=date>10:41pm CST Wednesday 27 December 2000</p></p>

<p>Wende was supposed to get off work at 10pm tonight.  It's not
unusual for her to be there longer than expected, but I just got a
call from one of her co-workers indicating that Wende is essentially
stuck there until they can get the alarm on.  She's on the phone with
the alarm company now, trying to get it fixed.</p>

<p>My work was frustrating for unexpected reasons today.  10 or 11
year old Butch, the son of Dennis, one of my co-workers, was there and
acted like any good and normal quizzical 10 or 11 year old should.
But ACK I just couldn't get anything done!  I never said anything
because I was on the edge of yelling at him, "get the fuck out of my
face!!!" which I didn't think would be appropriate or helpful.</p>

<p>I did get some stuff done - converting the Stupid Project to my
cool Generic Project still.  I'm further along in the process now.</p>

<p>I've transcribed more 1992 journal entries, and I have the
overwhelming feeling that my life is <em>-*! BORING !*-</em> compared
to my college days.  Will this feeling change?  Will I think my life
in 10 years from now is <em>-*! BORING !*-</em> compared to 2000, and
<em>-*! OH MY GOD INCREDIBLY BORING !*-</em> compared to my college
days?</p>

<p>I sure hope not.  I just don't know.</p>

<p class=date>6:44am CST Tuesday 26 December 2000</p>
<p class=note>(4am dream)</p></p>

<p class=dream>I was in the cartoon <em>Futurama</em> and Fry was
driving his old car from the year 2000.  A small fire was burning in
the base of the gear shift, as a result of not having enough oil.
Watched him drive it down the hill and around to a dock over a lake
where it fell into the lake while full of people.</p>

<p class=dream>We ran down to help, and people were all in the water
trying to grab onto the dock to float.  I helped a woman grab onto the
dock and walk her hands up toward safety.</p>

<p class=dream>A man from my men's group gave us masks so we could
swim under water and breath under water.</p>

<p class=dream>I spent some time shaking little tiny rubber beads out
of the tubing of my mask before I put it on.  It basically was just
face goggles and little rubber straps that hooked back on my ears,
like an ear plug to keep water from getting in my years and also to
hold the mask on.  I got a firm airtight seal over my face and went
under water.  I was pleased with how easy it was to breathe.</p>

<p class=dream>There was a mouse selling little green plastic frogs,
so I went over to him to get a picture of me as if I were buying a
little plastic frog from a mouse underwater.  The mouse was about four
feet tall, and not very impressed with our joke because we weren't
actually buying a frog.</p>

<p class=dream>I swam back under the dock and was sitting on some
couches apparently no longer under water, at a meeting with KTRU or
YRUU people.  There was some people from men's group there and they
made a huge poster with the bodies of a king and queen with the faces
of the administration of Rice or something like that.  People cheered
or appreciated the poster.</p>

<p class=dream>After the meeting, we were sitting on the curb in the
middle of the street just chilling and talking for some hours as
traffic got heavier around us.  A Camaro cop car saw us and put on his
lights.  I was all, "either we're busted, or someone else is."  We
were busted and he said, "go to the restaurant across the street."  so
we went and sat in a booth and I said, "okay, let's simply tell them
we've been sitting there for at least 3 hours and traffic got bad in
that time.  "Okay."  But the cop never walked up before I woke up.</p>

<p>emacs moved the eighteenth ring!!  Now it will take this many days
again before it gets to move the nineteenth ring.</p>

<p>I just used dc to determine that it will take approximately 5.845 *
10^11 years before it finishes.  I think I already wrote that, but not
as precisely.</p>

<p>Today at work I did some more flash stuff - I made a simple form
that sends variables to SAS.  Now I have to figure out how to send
variables back to the shockwave movie to make it work as a survey they
way I want.</p>

<p>So far, I have not found any tutorials on the web that describe how
to do this.</p>

<p class=date>23:48 Tuesday 26 December 2000</p>

<p>Good news:  I have found out what I need to make the Flash stuff
work the way I want.</p>

<p>Bad news:  I typed on the emacs hanoi window, causing it to
stop.</p>

<p>Here is how far it got:</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>I was in charge of the Houston Rally, and I had found
Cheri, one of my long lost YRUU friends dead on the floor.  I tried to
ignore her to make it go away, but she was still there the next day
when the rally started.  She had moved to a big drawer.</p>

<p class=dream>I was totally sad but kept my composure, with no idea
what to do, so I asked for Steve's support.  We called a meeting of
sorts to stop the rumors about Cheri.  I told them amidst big tears,
"Cheri is dead, and is right back there," pointing toward the
drawer</p>

<p>and I woke up.  Woah.</p>
