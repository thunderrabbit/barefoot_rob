<p><em>Looking at some notes, I found a cryptic word like Pinecal, and then Obreil.  With those, I was able to look up online that they&rsquo;re putting together a property in Hawaii!  Awesome!  Just as I was looking away from the notes, I heard her behind me, &ldquo;is someone off the list?&ldquo;  I was caught looking where I shouldn&rsquo;t have been looking.  I didn&rsquo;t lie; I just said &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; and then she lied for me so no one else would know.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re on the list; I love J-pop!!&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>I was sent back in time from the present era to about 30 years ago, and saw my friend Kellie who I hoped could help me.</em></p>

<p><em>I was talking to Kellie, and was now about the same age as her.  We were in a military installation or at least a government building, and I wanted to go outside, so I asked if she would show me the area.  She took me out onto the grounds of the building and was showing me stuff.  I interrupted her a bit when I thought we were far enough away so they couldn&rsquo;t hear.</em></p>

<p><em>I faced toward her and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to hug you and make it look like we are kissing or something, but don&rsquo;t get the wrong idea; I need to  tell you something, &rdquo; I said as I put my head on her shoulder, huggingly.</em></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;What year is it right now?&rdquo; I asked.</em></p>

<p><em>She goes, &ldquo;1978.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Okay, somewhere on the planet, I&rsquo;m 8 years old. &rdquo; I intended to tell her this so she&rsquo;d be read for the rest of what I wanted to tell her: I&rsquo;ve been sent back in time to prepare us to be prepared to record by multiple camera angles the World Trade Center destruction of the first building that was hit by a plane, and for more recording equipment to be placed in the building preceding and during their destruction.</em></p>

<p><em>But she couldn&rsquo;t handle the idea that I had been sent from the future.. she pushed me back out of the hug and was like, &ldquo;what?  no way; you&rsquo;re trying to trick me,&rdquo; etc and  I was like, &ldquo;no no for real,&rdquo; etc and the scene changed and I was listening to another idea for how to have the survelleince be done, under the guise of preserving some historic homes along the river.  Some antique houses had been falling into the river through neglect, and we were going to fund a stludy on how to evaluate their condition and see which ones could be restored to their original pristine state.</em></p>

<p><em>We showed video of a house falling into the river; it was a blue 3 story house, but only one room on each story, so quite tall and narrow.  A homeless person had moved in, and the weight of him walking around had unsettled the building.  It tipped over into the river.</em></p>

<p><em>A guy was explaining something about the train tracks, and had taken the train lines apart at a seam but then the train came so he had to quickly bolt them back together.  He got the rails reconnected but they were quite out of alignment for that section and I was afraid the train would derail, but it sped through the section unscathed.  I was helping him put the rails back to their original straightness when I woke up.</em></p>

<p>Just leaving Charu&rsquo;s house after an afternoon of sewing there.   Lin made a bunch of owls for people, and I made a dog for her mom.  Made with love, but nothing technically amazing; they&rsquo;re just 2D pillows.</p>

<p>I was gonna work on 楽しい英語, but got so tied up sewing, I just sewed instead.  The seams seemed like a good thing at the time.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to Matt&rsquo;s iOS classes starting in January.  He said he wants to start with &ldquo;what&rsquo;s really going on under the surface of Xcode,&rdquo; an idea I heartily agree will help me figure out wtf is going on half the time with Xcode.</p>

<p>I imagine if Apple had kept Google&rsquo;s original map app, Google wouldn&rsquo;t have utterly redesigned its new map app, which is beautiful.   Thanks to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN</a>, I found <a href="https://sachagreif.com/design-details-of-google-maps-for-ios/">Sacha Greif&rsquo;s nice writeup on Google&rsquo;s map app</a>.</p>

<p>I just committed some code to my repo and noticed the first 12 characters of the hash are numeric.  Normally, given that it&rsquo;s a random hexadecimal string, there are some characters in the abcdef family.
