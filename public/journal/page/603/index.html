<p><p>Kathy Fey is a healer.
She is a licensed massage therapist, reiki practicioner, cranio sacral
expert, and lymphatic drainage therapist.</p>

<p><p>My dad met her back some years ago at The Renaissance Festival. I began
visiting her on a semi regular basis back in 1998 or so, when I read in
<em>The Pleidian Agenda</em> that people would benefit from spiritual/body
work.</p>

<p><p>Kathy has massaged kinks out of  my neck, back, arms, hips, feet, legs,
and neck (again).  She has used a technique called cranio sacral to loosen
up other parts of me- past life injuries, my sinuses, and just my life force
in general.</p>

<p><p>She&rsquo;s full of light and laughter, always greets me with a warm hug of a
kindred spirit.  She asks about all my stuff, offers her stories to me and
then asks what type of her healing skillz shall she use today.</p>

<p><p>I have not seen her in awhile, but my dad bought me a session with Kathy
for my 11,000th day.  Today I&rsquo;m using that session.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ll let you know how it goes.</p>

<p><p class=date>9 pm</p>

<p><p>Kathy and I talked until about 7:15 before even starting massage.  We
spent a significant time talking about movies we had seen recently, and
about the anti-racism training I attended at Youth Council.</p>

<p><p>My session consisted entirely of a full body massage.  So relaxing; I
totally fell asleep twice.  She had a CD of rhythmic drumming and chanting
in the background.  I was zonked.</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;re working on a project that allows users to select the language they
want to use.</p>

<p><p>Used to be that the datasets for the languages was really poorly written.</p>

<p><p>With Kevin&rsquo;s SAS skillz and my programming skillz, we are revamping this

<p><p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was sleeping and heard the weather report on 740
KTRH, the am 24 hour news radio in Houston.  The weather guy said that
a big storm was coming toward the city and he advised that everyone go
buy some duct tape and tape up windows so they wouldn&rsquo;t be broken by
the storm.  I woke up in my dream and the storm was already pounding
rain against the windows.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Went downstairs to find Wende to tell her; she was in
the shower like in a basement and there was a small spider crawling on
the shower floor.  I shooed the spider away from her and didn&rsquo;t kill
it.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I told Wende about the storm and that it was pretty
much too late to go get duct tape, so we just waited and I woke up for
real.</p>

<p><p class=note>(different dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>Wende and I were living together in the Methil house
(where I lived from 3rd to 7th grade) and we had our cats and
everything.  I dreamt we were sleeping and that I felt a sharp pain in
my neck during my sleep, but thought nothing of it.  Wende woke up
before me and was getting ready for work when we went outside for
something.  I was only wearing a shirt.  We were talking about my
decision to be on the KTRU Council.  I felt that I really should do
it; no one else represented my demographics: non-student, barefoot,
adult.  I owed it to KTRU to be on the council.</p>

<p><p class=dream>As we were going back inside, a van drove up all loud
music and stuff.  I flashed them by lifitng my shirt as they pulled
up. They were giving away bags of potato chips and water.  The water
was their product they were trying to sell.  Giving away free samples
to raise product awareness.  We thanked them and went inside; they
presumably drove off.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Back inside we went inside and I tried to take my shirt
off, but it was stuck to my neck.  I reached back there to find what
was wrong, and horrorified to find that the security tag thing that
keeps people from stealing clothing was still on the shirt, and its
needle had stabbed and stuck in my neck vertebra.  I was so freaked
that I could hardly tell Wende what had happened, but pulled it out of
my spine and took the shirt off to show her.  I was all considering
the best way to medically treat it; go to a hospital or what..</p>

<p><p class=dream>Then I dreamt I was asleep again and the KTRU DJs were
at a wild party, which included peeing on a big plastic tarp.  I was
about to join the fun and then I woke up.</p>

<p><p>I had to pee.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;m awake now.  ;-)</p>

<p><p>Hanging out with Laura has been fun!  We visited until Wende finished
coming home and then visited at Souper Salad for dinner.  My tummy felt
pretty full and blechy so I didn&rsquo;t even have any ice cream.</p>

<p><p>Wende and Laura are downstairs talkin and stuff.</p>

<p><p class=date>10:00pm</p>

<p><p>Fun talking about cats and family and computers and genealogy.  Laura was
all, &ldquo;oh my gosh it&rsquo;s 9:30!&rdquo;  I had a vague sense that it was late, but
didn&rsquo;t really think about it.</p>

<p><p>Great to catch up with Laura!!</p>

<p><p>I came in early to work today since I took so long yesterday to get into
actual work mode.  Full intention to get some good stuff done.</p>

<p><p>Got sidetracked though - with calls from SAVVIS (our ISP) regarding
Kevin&rsquo;s home DSL line being down, with calling Marcus my claims adjuster
regarding fixing Scott after the wreck, and with trying to get email to work
from our home office DSL locations.</p>

<p><p>I think now I&rsquo;m essentially on track and can get some stuff done.</p>

<p><p>Oh!  Laura is coming over at 7pm!  She&rsquo;s my lovely friend from The Castle
of Dreams who invited me over to <a href="https://www.geeky-boy.com">BBST</a></p>

<p><p>It will be fun to say HI to her.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Looking over the FSD financials with Kevin, he said I would
get $6000 as a bonus at the end of the year.   We had a project that would
net us 110,000,000,000,000,000 dollars.  I was all, &ldquo;Kevin, that is more
then the debt of the US Treasury; how can this be???&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=note>(different dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was in a shopping mall with continental YRUU youth and
looking at some videos in a movie rental place.  They were all old school
videos, including <em>The Making of Batman</em></p>

<p><p class=dream>This video seemed weird because it showed scenes I didn&rsquo;t
remember from the movie.  This did not trigger me to think I must be
dreaming.</p>

<p>"it's" instead of "its" is one of my most pet peevingest errors.  Now,
I'm not a grammatical genius, but I think an editor should be, or at least
pay someone who is.
