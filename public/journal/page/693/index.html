<p><p class=date>Thursday 12 AM, June 17, 1992</p>

<p><p>I now have a <b>486</b></p>

<h1><b>486!</b></h1>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m currently restoring my 3 hard drives worth of information that
I had while Tammy and I were together.  I bought</p>

<p><p><table>
<tr><td>4 megs of memory</td><td>$190.00</td></tr>
<tr><td>486DX/33 with 64k cache</td><td>$470.00</td></tr>
<tr><td>Medium Tower case with 200 watt power</td><td>$109.00</td></tr>
<tr><td>2H, 2F, Tape, 2parallel, 1 serial I/O card</td><td>$29.00</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tape backup 120 meg</td><td>$229.95</td></tr>
<tr><td>120meg tape</td><td>$19.00</td></tr>
<tr><td>1.4meg floppy</td><td>$59.95</td></tr>
</table></p>

<p><p>I think that&rsquo;s all.  I just put the prices in here to see how they
fall in the future.</p>

<p><p>I bought it in those pieces from EPO.  (There was quite a cute girl
at the cash register.)  I had a lot of trouble getting it working- It
even baffled Pierre and my dad.  I couldn&rsquo;t get FDisk to work
properly.  then Hal came over and did the same things we all tried and
it fucking worked.</p>

<p><p>Hmmm this sucks.  I just restored everything to C D &amp; E drives, but
the C drive won&rsquo;t boot.  So I can only boot from A:.  I noted that
IBMIO.SYS and the other hidden file weren&rsquo;t there, so I copied them
over, but it still didn&rsquo;t work.  so I just now reformatted C: with the
/s switch to transfer system files.  It worked.  Now I&rsquo;m re-restoring
the 4 disks worth of drive C stuff.  Cool.  If the boots OK, I&rsquo;ll try
putting all 4 megs of my memory in the machine and we&rsquo;ll see if that
works.  Then I want to run Stunts.  &ldquo;Tomorrow&rdquo; I&rsquo;m going shopping with
Tammy.  We&rsquo;ll buy shorts and stuff for me.</p>

<p><p>Shit this sucks!  I just tried to reboot and it prints some garbage
shit on the screen.  Three times in a row.  Same shit.  Well, I don&rsquo;t
know what the hell is wrong.  I just played Stunts.  Cool.  Later</p>

<p><p class=date>12:25 AM, Sunday, June 14, 1992</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ve made a decision to buy a 486 as my new computer.  It&rsquo;s going
to kick ass.  Yesterday, Christina called out of the blue and we went
to Marble Slab and ate icecream with some of her friends from Rice
University.  Very cool.  Today after Kroger, I drove Fred to Tomball
so he can get his car.  I came back and stopped by Dad&rsquo;s to get some
Dr Dobb&rsquo;s Journals.  When I got home, Christina called me and I went
over and helped her take her heating element out of her dryer.  Not too
hard at all.  Then we sat and talked for 1.5 hours on her front steps.
Very cool.  I got home and was reading a bit in the Dr Dobb&rsquo;s.  It
said I could get copies of the programs via an FTP site anonymously.
Dude.  Check this out. Caleb (Black Magus on Castle of Dreams) was
here and he showed me a way to call a medical center VAX, etc
somewhere.  So I called this computer and hooked into Telnet and in
this manner called the U of H Vax and logged into my LISP account.
Dude.  I didn&rsquo;t call the UH Vax directly because I can&rsquo;t remember/find
the number.  So I was in my LISP account and tried LISP.  (It didn&rsquo;t
work.)  (So I called Jerry and left voice mail fro him to fix it) So I
did FTP and called the place where I can get DR Dobb&rsquo;s stuff.  I
called the place via FTP via UH VAX via medical center Vax and
download the archives containing the source code for the January 1992
through June 1992.  Fucking incredible.  So it&rsquo;s in my LISP account
and I just need to go there and pick them up.  Dude.</p>

<p><p>Also today I drank literally 2 quarts of water all at once.  Dude.
I haven&rsquo;t pissed yet either 1 or 2 hours later.  Later</p>

<p><p class=date>June 12 1992 3AM or so</p>

<p><p>I can&rsquo;t see shit cause it&rsquo;s dim and I don&rsquo;t have my glasses on
anyway.  I need to design an outlet cover for electrical wall sockets
that can close and be slush with the wall and only have a little thumb
notch showing both where it is and how to open it.</p>

<p><p>Yesterday, I got my response from Monner and Grandad they sent me
1500 dollars holy shit that&rsquo;s wonderful.  And dad gave me the 3000
that he promised.  Very cool.  I&rsquo;m going today to get my huge paycheck
that will result from me working 52 hours last week.  I&rsquo;ll deposit a
big honker deposit in my account and Tuesday I&rsquo;ll go computer
shopping.</p>

<p><p>Yesterday, Tammy called me at work from my house.  She said that
she &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about me, so she decided to come over and
ride me.&rdquo;  Oh my god - my toes started going right there at work.  I
had to take a raincheck, though.  She said she might let herself in
some night and we&rsquo;ll fuck like crazy.  Excellent.  Later</p>

<p><p class=date>12:10 AM Thursday, June 10, 1992</p>

<p><p>Today at work I wrote out the following message:  (this is abridged)</p>

<p><p><blockquote>Thunder wakes up after 59 hours of sleeping by his old
room.  A crowd gathered around him to see what was up.  It turns out
he was abducted and made to rewrite the code for the super chess
computer, Deep Thought.  In COBOL.</blockquote></p>

<p><p>That is so funny.  thunder was all crying just thinking about it.
I haven&rsquo;t been able to upload the message though.</p>

<p><p>I called Peter (cousin) today up in Ohio, I assume.  We talked
about old and new times.  Very cool.  We talked about girls and school
and dorm stories, etc.  I had 3 calls while he and I talked: Lucy,
Jeanine &amp; Fred, (and maybe Molly) He was like, &ldquo;Damn!  You got women
like crazy!&rdquo;  I wish, but it was cool to let him think that.. So I
called Jeanine back and we talked for 30 minutes and now Molly is
supposed to call back any second.  I wish she&rsquo;d hurry up and call,
since I want to try to upload my message.</p>

<p><p class=date>2:40 AM Wednesday June 10, 1992</p>

<p><p>Today I installed Turbo Pascal 6.0 and Turbo C 2.01 on the computer
and ran stacker to make it all fit.  I called Lady Di&rsquo;s bulletin board
and chatted with her for 2 hours about.  Our chat turned to sex for a
while and she hinted at being interested in having sex with me.  I
don&rsquo;t know what will happen.  She&rsquo;s 45 and has a boyfriend.  But we
flirted and talked about her wearing a birthday suit to the Castle
Super Soaker Party.  She seemed Ok with that.  I left a message on her
board asking for a female roomate (on the board) and she said a girl
named Velvet Box (!) would be interested in rooming with Thunder
Rabbit.  Cool.  We&rsquo;ll see what happens.</p>

<p><p class=date>5:35AM, Monday, June 8, 1992</p>

<p><p>Yesterday at work I got a one dollar tip for sacking groceries.
Cool.  Matt won 50 bucks in the Texas Lottery.  After work I went to
Heather&rsquo;s and ate chicken paprika in exchange for moving some
furniture.  dude.  We planned to go walking today in the early AM.  So
I&rsquo;m just about to call her at 5:45 am and we&rsquo;ll both start walking
down W. Gray and meet somewhere in the middle.  I also planned to do
my laundry at 5:45AM, so I got up at 3:30AM and did that.  Oh - Today
was Psycho Robbie&rsquo;s first 3AM - 6AM Monday show.  I called him at 3AM
to congratulate him.</p>

<p><p>Oh- the very first song he played was introduced as a sweater song
(The title was something about a sweater) So he pushed the button at
&ldquo;One&rdquo; by U2 came on.  I was like, &ldquo;Uh-Oh&rdquo; but he switched it to the
right song no problem.  So when I called him I congratulated him and
he said Man, Robert O&rsquo;quinn (I think) put the wrong tape in the slot!&rdquo;
I said, &ldquo;yeah he put &ldquo;One&rdquo; in there.  It&rsquo;s okay, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m on the phone with Heather and told her what&rsquo;s up.  I&rsquo;m leaving
to meet her at gate 3.  Later</p>

<p><p class=date>Late that night</p>

<p><p>Heather and I enjoyed our walk and are going again tomorrow.  Today
Fred and I went to UH and played frisbee all over the Agnes Arnold
escalators.  My feet are <em>sore</em>.  I called Castle of Dreams
today.  Thunder Rabbit came in <em>Very tired</em>.  He couldn&rsquo;t open
his door (the lock was changed and someone else lives in his room) so
he crashed hard right on the spot.  I couldn&rsquo;t get back in to upload
the message, though.  I&rsquo;m horny.  Later</p>

<p><p class=date>Saturday, June 6, 1992 10:39 PM.</p>

<p><p>I slept in today and rolled around in bed for hours and did nothing
until I had to work at Kroger at noon.  At first I was groucy, but
then Roy started sacking for me and I picked on him a lot, so I felt
better.  A guy came in and bought a lottery ticket.  Roy knew him
since he used to work there, so we were all talking and stuff and he
bought the lottery ticket.  I asked if he wanted to choose the one he
wanted, but he had me choose instead.  I laid them out on the counter
and chose one.  It was a 2 dollar winner.  Cool.  Roy almost had a
heart attack right there because he wanted to know &ldquo;how&rsquo;d you do that,
Rob?&rdquo;  I just laughed at him.  He&rsquo;s so funny..  Then a second later,
the guy came back and gave me a dollar, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s your share.&rdquo;  Dude.
That was great&hellip; Roy got so upset and I just cracked up.</p>

<p><p>Later today, I was checkin at a register right behind Quina, the
beautiful girl who won&rsquo;t give me her phone number.  I heard this whump
and saw something go flying.  I thought someone had thrown something.
Then I looked at Quina, who was holding an opened can of biscuits!
Then I looked at my register, and one had landed flat splat on my
counter!  I died laughing.  Quina looked so embarassed.  I loved it.</p>

<p><p>After work, I went to Soundwaves and bought 4 used CD&rsquo;s, and 1 New
CD.  Used: Cyndi Lauper, <em>She&rsquo;s So Unusual</em> for the song &ldquo;All
through the Night&rdquo;, Big Audio Dynamite II, <em>The Globe</em> for &ldquo;The
Globe&rdquo;, Enigma, <em>MCMXC a.D.</em> for the song &ldquo;Sadness Part 1&rdquo;, and
Crunch 0 Matic, <em>Caution: D0 N0t Play</em> for the title.
Literally I bought it because it said &ldquo;Do not Play.&rdquo;  Reverse
psychology got me.  Unfortunately, the whole album is stupid, so I&rsquo;m
going to take it back.  I also bought a new CD by Tori Amos,
<em>Little Earthquakes</em> for the song &ldquo;Silent all these years.&rdquo;
I&rsquo;m currently listening to Enigma&hellip;..  Dude.  It&rsquo;s on track 7: way
spaced out single drum beats and the 5 tones from Close Encounters
played on xylophone maybe.  Pretty cool.  Well, enough mistakes for
the page.  Later.</p>

<p><p>Jodi and I went alone to House of Pies.  We requested the &ldquo;first
Pauline table&rdquo; Pauline is the incredibly pretty short blonde waitress
with cool earrings and cool haircut.  Oh- her nametag says Pauline,
but her name is actually Angela.  We at $10.50 worth of stuff and I
gave her at $10.50 tip.  Dude.  A perfect 100% tip.  Molly asked me to
leave her a big tip.  So I did.  Before we left, I made sure she knew
what group I represented.  Cool.  I may do it again sometime later.
She was having &ldquo;one of those nights.&rdquo;  She gave me a chocolate shake
instead of vanilla, but I didn&rsquo;t worry about it.  We talked fro a
little bit at the end- she thought our group was from Rice, but I told
her what was correct.  I&rsquo;ve basically screwed up the whole account of
the night.  But oh well.  At the end she knew what group we
represented and she said that she was really sorry to have missed our
last night at House of Pies.  I told her not to worry about it too
much.  We&rsquo;ll be back.</p>

<p><p>Today I worked 10 hours at the pharmacy for the last time.
(hopefully) Cool.  (Emilio should be back Monday) I will like my
paycheck at least.</p>

<p><p>Today Fred went to the Oklahoma All Souls church Rally.  Cool.  He
is probably in route right now.  I called Heather after work today and
talked to her for a couple hours.  Dude.  I really enjoyed it and I
told her so.  She is super wonderful.  Man I am so tired.  Later</p>

<p><p class=date>12:20Am Wednesday, May 3, 1992</p>

<p><p>I went to Lucy&rsquo;s today and rubbed sunburn gel on her naked back and
ass.  Very cool.  We didn&rsquo;t do anything or even kiss though.  Dude
I&rsquo;ve received my 3-D camera and jewelry from Nishika.  I think I&rsquo;m
just going to sell it, though.  The picture sample they sent me is
pretty cool.  Holy shit I&rsquo;m tired.</p>

<p><p clas=date>8:39 AM same day.</p>

<p><p>Lucy just called to say &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; for putting the lotion on her
back.  I told her that I enjoyed doing it.  Right now I&rsquo;m recording
Barsky show - Psycho Robbie is about to do Listener Cool Feelings.
Dude.  So I&rsquo;m going to record them and make a tape of Cool Feelings by
Psycho Robbie</p>
