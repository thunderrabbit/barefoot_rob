                        <p class=date>1:22 pm Saturday 24 February 2001</p>

<p>Today is Wende's birthday!  I haven't done or
gotten anything for her, but we are spending our first
Saturday together alone since last year it seems.</p>

<p>Today we are picking up Scott from the shop and
shopping for cell phones.</p>

<p>Right now we are munching lunch at a Chinese
restaurant.  I ordered almond chicken, but I'm
actually full after just my sweet and sour soup.</p>

<p>The dude at the auto shop said that the air
conditioner on Scott "blows real cold now," so yay for
air conditioner in the summer!</p>

<p class=date>5:48 pm</p>

<p>We have determined that Scott does not blow air
conditioned air "real cold," so I'll call them Monday
and take him back in next week.</p>

<p>We got new cell phones today!  Identical model
Nokias, and I really like them, "which is saying a
lot," Wende assured the Sherman the sales guy.</p>

<p>I like the menuing system, and that I can associate
multiple phone numbers with a single name.  But what I
like most: it has Predictive Text input, meaning if I
type 3833, it knows I mean the word "dude" and not
"ataa."  I don't have to type the 3 key twice to get
the e nor the 8 key twice to get the u.  And I can add
words to its dictionary!</p>

<p>Speaking of "its," we visited a different store
which had happy phrases like "Free Text Messaging" and
"We Are Great" and "Business At Its' Best."</p>

<p><em>What???</em></p>

<p>"Business At <em>Its'</em> Best" ?????</p>

<p>I was so offended that I almost left, but Wende was
still looking at something and talking to a girl named
Amy who recognized my bare feet from Taub Hall at
UH!</p>

<p>We talked to her and asked questions; she was quite
knowledgable about all kinds of phone stuff.</p>

<p>She showed us these fly new phones, but they only
had demo models.  We had to go to a different store to
actually purchase them.  Since she really made the
sale, we will give her a gift certificate and a nice
letter to her manager or something. (And a scathing
letter to their marketing department.)</p>

<p class=date>9:24 pm</p>

<p>We are at The Mad Potter, and I've just painted a
medium size salad bowl for Meredith's Christmas
present.  (Yes, a tad late)</p>

<p>But even more recently, I just unicycled rom here
to home and back to get the gift certificates from Mad
Potter that I got in exchange for setting up their
original domain and website.</p>

<p>The certificates are expired, but I thankfully
intend that they accept them.  I'm prepared to debate
the point because I was originally supposed to be paid
cash.</p>

<p>My unicycle ride impressed me.  On the way home I
stayed aloft the entire time, including crossing two
streets, with 4 and 5 lanes respectively! 
<em>And</em> I successfully did some tight turns while
going up a driveway ramp and turning onto a sidewalk
and then turning the corner to the next sidewalk!  Yay
unicycle!</p>

<p>Oh, today Donna and I both thought we were supposed
to be at KTRU.  She was there first when Wende and I
arrived.  Wende and I will come back next week, and
Donna and I will alternate shifts from there.  Sucks
because neither of us was there last week.  doh!</p>

<p>I just spent 2.75 hours moving my journal entries
from my Handspring Visor to my website.  I'm super
glad to have that part finished!</p>

<p>Still need to get all our pictures developed.  I
would like to scan most of them and put them on my
website, but I don't have enough storage space.</p>

<p>I will therefore probably put them on my geocities
site, but then they aren't automagically linked and
stuff.  I'm not sure how I'll ultimately solve
that.</p>

<p>Welcome back to work; DNS problems with the unix
box after they upgraded our firewall while I was
gone.</p>

<p>Arriving at the airport to leave now.</p>

<p class=date>10:07 am</p>

<p>We have checked our bags through to Los Angeles and
are chillin' in a restaurant type place with a view
over the tarmac.</p>

<p>I have just finished all my post cards; I wrote
about 40 over the course of our vacation, I'm
guessing. Wende has written a lovely postcard to her
youngest sister, and has begun her second postcard
now.</p>

<p>Before we left the house, Wende and I hugged Irene,
Nick, Tom, Dot, and Ed off on their 3 week driving
adventure up the coast.  They are driving to Sydney
today.</p>

<p>We have concern for the sanity of those involved;
Ed and Dot bicker incessantly.  Eww!</p>

<p class=date>10:26 am</p>

<p>I just saw a guy taking apart a pinball machine -
getting a ball unstuck or something.  He asked "are
you from Canada or America?"  with his logic being
that Canadians say "I'm Canadian, not American."</p>

<p>My favorite thing about the spoken language here is
that *<em>everyone</em>* says "yeh" for "yes."  And
it's not considered rude! Everyone says it to
everyone, no matter what age or relationship. 
Awesome.</p>

<p>My official postcard count is 43 to US, 1 to
Canada, 2 to OZ addresses.</p>

<p class=date>11:15 am</p>

<p>Time to go through customs and we are still eating.
 Gotta go!!!</p>

<p class=date>11:39 am</p>

<p>Now we are in the Gate 4 waiting area.  Flight is
s'posed to leave in about 35 minutes.</p>

<p>The flight is apparently only 1/2 full.   A cranky
6 year old is pouty crying nearby.</p>

<p class=date>11:51 am</p>

<p>Getting on the plane now.</p>

<p class=date>11:58 am Wednesday 21 February 2001</p>

<p>We are on the plane now.  I'm switching back to
CST.  According to the video display, it's 4:57pm
(Tuesday 20 February 2001) in Los Angeles, therefore
it's 6:57pm in Houston.</p>

<p>We are in Los Angeles Airport.  Interesting that we
had to transfer our own bags to the next courousel. 
Security gate made me x-ray my keyboard.</p>

<p>Wende found someone's boarding pass in the restroom
for a flight that is boarding now.  The boarding gate
attendant was not all that excited to receive it. 
Wende coulda just got on that flight!</p>

<p class=date>11:41 am</p>

<p>I have just spoken to Wende about my quest to find
out about the rotary organization that Bryn is in. 
Wende immediately said she felt abandoment issues
around it.  Hmmm.  I won't let that stop me.</p>

<p class=date>5:16 pm</p>

<p>I slept for most of the flight from LA to Houston. 
So very tired of being cramped up in the plane.</p>

<p>Dude forgot us at the airport; so we're waiting
outside for 30 - 45 minutes.  Wende is cell phone
talkin' to someone about our trip.  Oh it's Dude.  He
sent Veronica after us cause she was closer than
he.</p>

<p>Yay Veronica for picking us up at the airport!  She said Dude owes
her bigtime now.  :-)</p>

<p>At the airport Wende was all "I just want to be at home and
*sleep*."  But now she's on the phone.</p>

<p>I'm going to sleep soonishly maybe; and I'll upload a pile of
entries from my Handspring Visor tomorrow at work.</p>

<p>I've just taken a nap after we arrived home from
shopping.  I had a tremendous headache, but it s
relatively gone now.  We are about to go eat (!?)
though we have eaten pretty recently it seems to
me.</p>

<p>It's cool though; we are getting to eat with
Michael and Emma; I'm glad to get to see them
again.</p>

<p class=date>8:40 pm</p>

<p>I just said "HI" to Emma because she was staring at
the visor</p>

<p>I'm writing to say they pronounce the H in
herb.</p>

<p>Molly, ask John how long it would take a Concorde
to fly from LA to Melbourne, then let me know.</p>

<p class=date>9:45 pm</p>

<p>The ice cream here is dumb.  It's more icey than
creamy.  They actually have three types of "ice
cream:"</p>

<ul>
<li>extra creamy</li>
<li>ice cream</li>
<li>ice confectionery</li>
</ul>

<p>That's from creamiest to yuckiest.  Josephine says
that's because they don't want it so fattening.  I can
see the logic, but I said, "just run (to work it
off)."</p>

<p>differences:</p>

<ul>
<li>The cigarette packs have written in large
lettering right on the lid of the pack stuf like,
"SMOKING CAN KILL YOU"  and "SMOKING HARMS THOSE
AROUND YOU."  and "SMOKING CAUSES CANCER."   Lots and
lots of people smoke even so.</li>

<li>There is a bug zapper right in the kitchen up by
the ceiling in this restaurant.</li>

<li>restaurants are not allowed to give doggie bags
(because people sued after getting food
poisoning)</li>

<li>They ask "what's the time?" instead of "what time
is it."  (You can guess what I answer.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Last night Wende woke me up, "Robbie, have you been
hearing the wind?  It's been amazing." </p>

<p>I stayed awake listening, but I only heard the
traffic.  I think she was dreaming; she says she was
not.  Hmph.</p>

<p>We are outside by an outdoor market where Wende and
I just spent $185 AUS for some dining room linens and
a pillow for our living room.  We also got an apron
for Maggie (, but don't tell her).</p>

<p>The girls have gotten lost somewhere in a clothing
store; the guys are just sitting, waiting.</p>

<p>Wind is blowing effectively and it's a gorgeous
bright sunny day.</p>

<p>Big maple trees line the street to provide shaded
parking.</p>

<p>Irene's dad Ed is coughing and smoking.</p>

<p class=date>2:04 pm</p>

<p>We are finally leaving now.  Wende got some ceramic
dishes and a T-shirt for various family members.</p>

<p>I'm a bit headcahey and ready to eat.  Fortunately,
we are driving toward food now.</p>

                        <p class=date>8:36am Monday 19 February 2001</p>

<p>Last night I woke with a start from a dream where a
kangaroo came running up toward me, protecting his
territory.  I was all, "ahhh!" and I woke up.</p>

<p class=date>12:35 pm</p>

<p>We are Nick, Irene, Wende, Bryn, Tom and Rob,
driving to the beach somewhat close to Melbourne. 
Been listening to country music (Dixie Chicks, I
think) and talk talk talkin'.</p>

<p>Waking up this morning was pretty tough after only
4 hours of sleep.</p>

<p>We are low on petrol (gas) but Nick isn't worried. 
("No worries, mate.")</p>

<p>This morning I told Bryn about the Pets.com
commercials, starring the dog sock puppet.  Very
funny.</p>

<p>Oh, I also described my skating accident from 1995
or 1996.  She was like "wow.  why are you still
alive?"</p>

<p class=date>2:33 pm</p>

<p>Wow!  Swimming was in pretty cold water with pretty
big waves.  A sign warned of riptides, so we didn't go
out too far.  The sand is the same color as galveston,
but larger grains.</p>

<p>We successfully body surfed a few waves and had a
generally good time.  I dug a hole and buried my lower
legs.  Because the sand is such large grains, it was
super easy to get out.  Also the sand was only damp,
not soaked.</p>

<p class=date>6:21 pm</p>

<p>The second beach we attended provided several
samples of broken glass that had been polished by the
sand and surf.  Wave pools stretched over the water on
either side of the beach.  Wende surprised me and
actually got in the cold-ass water, and Bryn stretched
out for a nap.</p>

<p>Nick, Irene, Tom went walking out to the wave pools
while I dug myself into a hole in the sand.</p>

<p>We left for the official swimming beach, which
consisted of almost zero waves, and sand sloping in
such a shallow manner that Tom could be 100 meters out
and only be up to his knees in water.</p>

<p>I took a shower using pretty hot water.  When I got
back to the car, Tom sang, "it wasn't a Rob; it was a
Rob Lobster!"</p>

<p>Now we are taking Bryn back to the airport.</p>

<p>Wende and I are getting married in 487 days; Bryn
is going home in 142 days; we will see Bryn in 163
days at SWUUSI! </p>

<p class=date>7:37 pm</p>

<p>This is cool.  We are on a tollway that uses
cameras to determine who is on the toll.  Bryn is
using the cell phone to tell them we are going through
it without an electronic tag. She gave our license
plates, car make, model, color so that we won't get a
$100 fine.</p>

<p class=date>8:34 pm</p>

<p>Beaner's plane is being pushed out of the gate now.
 I cried after she disappeared down the jetway.  Big
Big big big hugs and even a hello to YAC on the video
camera.  I'm chewing gum that she just gave us each a
piece and I'm never going to throw it away.</p>

<p class=date>10:30pm</p>

<p>The gum got gross; I threw it away.</p>
