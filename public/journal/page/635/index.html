<p class=date>1:57am CST Thursday 17 February 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Ultimate was great fun tonight!  Now I know how some of the guys (John) who play Saturday night have gotten so much better!  On Wednesdays the field is huge and everyone runs!  The structure of play is different, too: instead of playing a game to a certain number of points, we just play one point at a time.  We maintain 7 or 8 people on each team, and as people get tired of play, they swap with people on the sidelines.  That way we don&rsquo;t waste time picking teams between games, and it&rsquo;s a bit nicer to not worry about score.  We just don&rsquo;t keep score at all.</p>

<p><p>On Saturday there&rsquo;s an ultimate tournament, &ldquo;Huckin&rsquo; For Love,&rdquo; sponsored by <a href="https://www.strayconesports.com">www.strayconesports.com</a>.  I just found out about it tonight, and am on the edge of late turning in my registration!  So I shall drive it to the downtown post office tonight and save one mail hop.</p>

<p><p><hr align=left width=20%></p>

<p><p>After ultimate, I somewhat randomly stopped in the large movie theater parking lot and rode my (borrowed from Scott) unicycle!  It had been suggested by Scott that using a shopping cart would be a perfect way to help me learn!  So I found a cart that had been left out for the night and tried his suggestion.  It didn&rsquo;t work worth crap for me.  So I just tried to ride it.</p>

<p><p>The huge flat expansiveness of the parking lot did the trick!  While I had previously been able to uni one block (on not totally flat sidewalk), about 300 feet, this time I was able to uni 112 wheel revolutions, and then a bit later, 145 wheel revolutions!  Lemme do the math - 1 foot radius wheel ~= to 6.2 foot circumfrence, * 112 and 145&hellip; I rode 703 and 911 feet!!!  Super awesome!!!  Those records of mine included some directed gentle turns as well.  Great!!</p>

<p><p>(I didn&rsquo;t do the math above in my head - I used dc, the reverse-polish desk calculator that came with Linux.)</p>

<p><p>With Love
<br>- Rob</p>

<p><p>phat!</p>

<p><p>I have just created a perl script that will allow one of my webpage clients to create pages on her site.  Basically it presents a textarea field so she can type text, press go and it will create the HTML for the page and write it to her site!</p>

<p><p><form>
<p>filename <input type=text></p>

<p><p><textarea cols=30 rows=8>
</textarea></p>

<p><p><input type=button value="submit">
</form></p>

<p><p>The fake form above doesn&rsquo;t do anything, but that&rsquo;s the idea.  Super great!  It&rsquo;s a tad more complicated than what I&rsquo;ve described, but not too much. (option to create file or append to it)</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ve spent longer than I had expected on it, but I&rsquo;m pleased with the results!</p>

<p><p><hr width=20%></p>

<p><p>Scott and Shawn (from Tyler and OKC respectively) called me last night on 3-way, just to say HI and stuff; I talked to them for a bit about nothin&rsquo; until some cop cars drove wailing down Shawn&rsquo;s street and he decided to go investigate the entertainment.</p>

<p><p>This morning Scott called me at KTRU and I totally encouraged him to record a CD with his songs and send it in to the station!!  It&rsquo;ll be cool to hear his stuff on KTRU!</p>

<p><p><hr width=20%></p>

<p><p>Ultimate frisbee tonight (Wednesday YAY!!)</p>

<p><p>Simpsons right now!</p>

<p><p>With Love

<p><p>ps  I just added an option to include your name in my <a href="/cgi-local/days/day.cgi">days old</a> counter.  If you have created a file already, but would like to add your name, email me at <a href="mailto:thunderrabbitATcheerfulDOTcom">thunderrabbitATcheerfulDOTcom</a> and I will delete the existing file so you can recreate it with your name! (tell me your birthdate too! ;-)</p>

<p class=date>9:23am CST Tuesday 15 February 2000</p></p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m reconciling my bank statement and see a surprising charge of
$38.60 from R&amp;R Manufacturing in Ramsey MN.  I&rsquo;m talking to the bank
now to dispute it.</p>

<p><p>(ugh I need a headset phone!)</p>

<p><p>Okay.  I&rsquo;ve got the phone receiver balanced on top of my head,
slightly tilted so I can (hopefully) hear the CSR when she comes back.
It worked!  But now I&rsquo;m back on hold.  Too bad I don&rsquo;t have a webcam!</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;re close to breaking record high temperatures!  Record high for
today is 84 degrees set in 1968 I think he said.  We are not likely to
hit it, but tomorrow and next day record of 81 and 83 degrees we are
more likely to reach. wow!</p>

<p><p>- - - - -</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Please answer the following questions so I can enter your
dispute,&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Have you given your card number to a merchant over the phone or
internet?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;have you used your card number to make regular payments to a
health club, or an internet service provider, or is your card being
credited for merchandise return?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>[pause] &ldquo;Um, okay: No to the health club, yes to the internet, no
to returned merchandise.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;do you have the card in your possession?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;are you the only one using the card?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;is your pin number on your card?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;no.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;did you file a police report?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;no.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>[pause] &ldquo;Okay.  I have entered a dispute in the amount of $38.60,
for which you will receive a provisional credit within 24 hours.
Within 5 days you will receive a letter indicating the status of the
dispute&hellip;..&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>- - - - -</p>

<p><p>The second question was so wacked that I had her go back and reread
it.  I&rsquo;ve written it pretty closely to how she read it, although the
wording on the merchandise return part is a bit off.  I told her that
it seemed pretty jumbled when asked that way.</p>

<p><p>Last night at Wende&rsquo;s, I wrote my first draft for a perl script
that I will use to keep track of my bank account balance on the web!
It will be called PerlCash.  If I am impressed with the results, I&rsquo;ll
give out the source code.</p>

<p><p>I still need to work out the specifics of what the transactions
will look like in the database, but that should be relatively minor.
(I can hear some of my college profs having a fit over that
statement.)</p>

<p><p>Ooops!  I gotta go to work!</p>

<br>- Rob</p>

<p class=date>5:43pm CST Sunday 13 February 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Fox rules.  For a long time I watched no TV at all.  I still tell people, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t watch TV.&rdquo;  Sometimes I even say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a TV.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>These statements are actually not true.  Not that I&rsquo;m <em>lying</em>, but that it&rsquo;s been so long since I&rsquo;ve <em>Really</em> watched TV.  I had no TV for 10 years.  That is true.</p>

<p><p>I just forget that I love the Simpsons and Futurama!!!  And the most exciting thing is that Futurama is back on the air starting tonight (<em>in 12 minutes!!</em>)!!!!!</p>

<p><p>I even purchased a VCR tape to record episodes.</p>

<p><p>See, Wende and I wanted to be able to rent movies and watch &lsquo;em, but neither of us owned a TV.  Or a VCR.  So I bought a 13&rdquo; TV/VCR combo for $119 or so from Target.  It works well for movies, and I found that by sticking a spool of floral wire into the cable connection thing, I get pretty good reception of FOX!</p>

<p><p>Lovely.</p>

<p><p>Wende is preparing chicken tonight.  Yay!!!</p>

<p><p>With Love
<br>- Rob</p>

<p><p>9 minutes!!!</p>

<p>I am super duper enjoying my new website and domain!

<p>My journal.cgi script makes it SO Easy to add entries to my
journal.  I just create the entry in the correct directory and
<em>bang</em> it's indexed!!  Perl rules.

<p>Just today I added a cool feature for YOU! To read my latest entry,
<!-- OLD: just use this <a href="/cgi-local/journal.cgi?dir=latest">link</a>. -->
just use this <a href="/journal/">link</a>.
Feel free to bookmark it; I intend for it to work indefinitely.  (Used
to be that ya had to specify a directory and it would automagically
find the latest file in the directory.  Now it automagically finds the
latest of both!)

<p>I would say I'm about halfway done moving my site to this domain.

<p>With Love
<br>- Rob

<p class=date>2:04am CST Sunday 13 February 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Just finished taking a shower after playing Ultimate.  I play
barefoot, so they call me Wonderboy on the field.  This also means
that when I shower, large muddy streams flow from my feet to the
drain.  Kinda fun for the 5 year old in me.  I&rsquo;m all clean now,
though.</p>

<p><p>I got a surprising email recently from a woman named Dreama.  She
was doing genealogical research, looking for the middle name of her
GGGrandfather.  Turns out he is my GGGGrandfather, and she found his
name on my Geocities site.  Funniest thing is that I didn&rsquo;t know I had
genealogical stuff on my Geocities site!</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m guessing it was simply a reference to his name from a few years
ago when Laura and I were doing lots of research together.</p>

<p><p>- - - - -</p>

<p><p>Super exciting news!!  I got the days-old counter working on my
site!  It was already <em>working</em> but only to tell how many days
old <em>I</em> am.  I wanted for anyone to be able to enter their birthdate,
and have it show their age in days!  And now, you <a
href="/cgi-local/days/day.cgi">can do it!</a></p>

<p><p>I also updated my <a href="/rings">webring links</a>.  I like the
new format for The Spirit Ring!  I will probably try to join one more
(or more) online journal rings.</p>

<p><p>If I remember correctly, I haven&rsquo;t written in a week!!!</p>

<ol>
<p><li>Dallas Rally was great!  I will still write about it.  Highlights 
were Ultimate frisbee, and a entertainment by a professional magician!

<p><li>I've been working on a perl <a 
href="/cgi-local/coasters.cgi">script</a> to allow easy viewing of pictures 
with thumbnails!  Currently it draws thumbnails on the screen with links to 
the larger image.  Nothing technically fancy - it just matches up identical 
file names in different directories.  When complete, it will draw the 
thumbnails in a nice table, along with descriptions of each one!  AND when 
user clicks on thumbnail image, it will show the big image with a longer 
description below it.  Nice.

<p><li>I've been learning about PGP!  Some time ago I downloaded PGP and 
created keys for my home computer, but I never used them; I didn't really 
have a good sense of what all the terminology meant.  Yesterday and today 
I've been messing with it again.  If you have PGP ability, my key is 
available on the public key servers under "Rob Nugen at work."  There is 
also an entry for Rob Nugen at home, but don't use it.

<p><li>AaaAAannd I have just downloaded the <a 
href="https://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/">SETI@Home</a> software to use 
here at work!  I just found out about it, synchronistically twice 
yesterday.  Once at home and once at KTRU, in apparently unrelated events!

<p><li>Last thing: Today is the opening of <a 
href="https://www.tiggermovie.com"><em>The Tigger Movie</em></a>!!!  I'm 
super excited about it. I even plan to leave work a tad early to see a 
matinee showing with Wende at one of the big stadium theaters! 
 Wheeeeeee!!!!

<p><p>Wende and I saw <a href="https://www.tiggermovie.com"><em>The Tigger Movie</em></a>!!!  We both cried.  It wasn&rsquo;t sad <em>per se</em>, but such loving boding friendships and family between the animals&hellip;  I totally love Tigger!!</p>

<p><p>Now we&rsquo;re going to Star Pizza with Wende&rsquo;s friend Irene from high school and Irene&rsquo;s fiance Nick.</p>

<p><p>I am so disgusted with microsoft.</p>

<p><p>I just want to cry that they make bajillions of dollars marketing shitty
software.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m at work, trying to install Win NT 4.0, which I have done
successfully 3 times previously, with nearly identically hardware.  This
time it&rsquo;s reporting invalid BS after it boots for the final time and I
can&rsquo;t log in as administrator, the account that it specifically creates at
installation.</p>

<p><p>I tried to reinstall it to wipe everything out and make sure I didn&rsquo;t
miss something, but it won&rsquo;t give me the option to low level format the
drive and start from nothin&rsquo;.  It will only allow me to update the current
installation.  I did that and was not give the option to recreate the admin
account.  I just want to start from scratch.  Please microsoft, please let
me just start over.</p>

<p><p>Grrrr
