                        <p class=date>09:02:03 CST Saturday 3 February 2001</p>

<p>It's been *so long* since I've written!  Wow.  Work has just been
work work work and taking lots of energy.</p>

<p>Cool thing though - on Wednesday, I got to see Madeline!  She's a
girl that I met at the planning meetings for the Ultra Cosmic Mass
Extravaganza in October 1999.  We've been in vague email touch since
then and she called me once at KTRU about 2 months ago or so and then
we hung out at Eatzi's and then her school to see her latest website
creations and tons of art.</p>

<p>Right now I am at work, just about to install a new firewall and a
load balancer for our web servers.  Duane, our smart network guy has
just arrived on the scene.  See ya in a bit.</p>

<p class=date>09:24am</p>

<p>We just moved the 2 web servers and 1 mail server outside the
firewall while we install the new firewall.  We just checked to make
sure they all still work.</p>

<p class=date>12:07pm</p>

<p>Hmmm.  The webserver connectivity seems to be working, but one of
the webservers is not rebooting. Or it is rebooting, but the disks are
screwed up so it can't load the OS.  It had two mirrored drives and
the mirror broke and we can boot with the drive that has the old data,
but not the drive with the new data.  Worst case is we boot with the
old data drive and then restore a full restore from Thursday and then
Friday and Saturday incremental restores.</p>

<p class=date>13:16</p>

<p>We replaced the faulty disk, recreated the (software) mirroring and
are about to restore the data from tape.  Just as I had the tape
restore ready to go, Dave called and he'll come in.  I'm pretty sure I
was doing all the right stuff, but he's the expert, and I don't mind
waiting a few extra minutes to make sure it's done correctly.</p>

<p class=date>15:56</p>

<p>Bluh.  The disk mirroring and restore are all good, but now it
seems that though people (such as Will Smith) can visit our website
from outside, we can't visit it from inside.  I'm not sure why that is
not working.  We've moved the webservers to the DMZ and maybe it will
work now.  I'm really not clear on what is happening here.</p>

<p class=date>16:52</p>

<p>abort abort abort.  bluh.  The biggest snag that we couldn't
overcome today was making the backups work correctly.  The dumb thing
is that one of our webservers is also doing backups for our whole
system.  When it was moved the the DMZ, it couldn't see the rest of
the network to do backups.  So we are calling off the whole operation
until that can be resolved.  Pooh.</p>

                        <p class=date>11:55pm Tuesday 30 January 2001</p>

<p>I've been meaning to write after each interesting
event today, but I did not.</p>

<p>This morning, relatively early for work, I decided
to go say HI Ricky, the owner/manager of a Chevron
(gas) station in downtown.  I've known him since I was
with Tammy, back back back about 10 years ago.  I
would stop by and say HI often on my way to school or
to and from work.</p>

<p>Great to connect with him again.  Big hug as he
joked, "I thought you didn't like me anymore!"  He had
called me a couple (few?) times and I never called him
back.  Told him all the latest news: house,
engagement, spanish classes, costa rica in 2002.. 
Ironically did not tell him about our imminent (sp
(sorry, Laura!)) trip to Australia; I didn't want to
"brag" though I know he would only have happiness and
blessing to offer.  That feels weird to me that I
didn't tell him.</p>

<p>He has a new grandson via his daughter, with
pictures to prove it.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Around 11am, Dude IMed me at work:</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">Dude</font>: MB?</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">Dude</font>: Sorry, gotta
boot, brb</p>

<p>I got the message a couple minutes later; I was
talking to Kevin at the time, but Dude never IMed me
back.  So I emailed his <!a
href="https://www.blackberry.com">blackberry<!/a>
(pager).</p>

<p>Turned out he was on his way with peeps from his
work, so I met them there.  Due to the lunch rush, the
parking lot was wacked when I arrived, so I parked
down at Whole Foods and rode my unicycle the 2 blocks
to Mission Burritos.</p>

<p>By the time I got my burrito, they were pretty much
done, but I still got to meet them all and say HI a
bit.  David in particular said my unicycle was
cool.</p>

<p>Oh!  And I must say that riding a unicycle is just
like riding a bicycle, in that I was able to just get
on and ride.  I haven't been on it in a couple weeks,
but I just got on, first try and rode.  Perfect. 
Awesome.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>After work, I met Wende at Spanish class and we
took essentially the second class in the series,
though we took the third class last night because the
Monday night group is a week ahead of us.  Next week
we will take the fourth class on Monday, the third
class (again) on Tuesday.  We will miss two weeks,
effectively the (5th and 4th) and (6th and 5th)
classes, and we can take the Tuesday night 6th class
after we get back.  So really we will only miss 1
class.  We can certainly learn that ourselves from the
book while in Australia.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>After class, as planned during lunch, I called Dude
and we met him and Veronica at Mission Burritos for
dinner!  (Mission Burritos is really awesome, and they
had 2 for 1 burritos on Tuesdays in January.  Muy
bueno!)  We talked about espanol, their house for
sale, hardwood floors, home owner disasters, a plane
mystery on NOVA, and other random stuff.</p>

<p>Near the end of dinner, Dude described the latest
scooter races at his work.  They have a course set up
for people to race on scooters.  The entire floor is
super smooth cement - excellent for scooters and
skates.  He said the fastest time was 28.5 seconds,
and then Dude beat it, and then the original record
holder beat him again, to like 27.57 seconds (as if
they can really time down to hundredths of a
second..)</p>

<p>As soon as he said 28.5, I thought in my mind, "I
can do it in 25 seconds."</p>

<p>After his story, I told him, so .....  we went to
his work to find out.</p>

<p>Wende dropped off Veronica at her house, and Dude
took me to his work, leaving my car at Mission
Burritos.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Elevator to one of the upper floors of the
building, where his company has the entire floor. 
Super smooth concrete everywhere, as I mentioned. 
Scooters were left against various walls and doors as
if so many kids were called in to dinner.</p>

<p>We said HI to a couple of people who were working
late, and Dude showed me the course.  As I saw it, I
recognized my fallacy.  The course is more than just
an Indy 500...  there are a few tight turns that must
be manuevered just so, or several dollars of equipment
could be damaged.  It's not like a china shop, but
still.. it's certainly no oval track.</p>

<p>I rolled around the course a few times while Dude
looked for the stopwatch.  He never did find it, but I
raced twice, using his wristwatch as the time
keeper.</p>

<p>On my first zing around the track, I kinda hit a
wall, and fortunately didn't break anything except my
shirt and scraped my shoulder.  I made that in 28
seconds according to his timekeeping.</p>

<p>The next time I didn't hit anything, but I only got
like 29 seconds.</p>

<p>The next time I totally crashed into the most
dangerous (in my opinion) obstacle of the track, (not
an expensive computer, but) a solid hip-level
countertop that would spell agony if clipped by a hip
that didn't make it through the door adjacent to the
rough edge of the counter.</p>

<p>In this case, I totally didn't make the turn and
just slowed myself and <em>bonked</em> into the
counter.  I knew I was lost, so I turned around and
"snuck up" on Dude from the other direction just to be
funny.</p>

<p>So I didn't make 25 seconds, but I was within
arguing range of having tied the record on my first
try.  Nice.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>On our way out of the building, we said HI to
Gloria, the security guard who has quite a few stories
to tell.  She ragged on dude for listening to hip hop,
saying that it will rot his brain and all kinds of
shit, and she let her word choice roam relatively
freely across the map.  Quite entertaining.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Dude dropped me off at MB and we left the parking
lot at essentially the same time.  He turned left at a
possible short cut, but I had the green light at the
next intersection, so I made waggly moose ears at him
out my side window as I drove by.</p>

<p>Today Wende and I joined the Monday spanish class
because we will miss two classes in February during
our excursion abroad.  The Monday class is ahead of
the Tuesday class; we studied tonight what the Tuesday
class will study next week.  Tomorrow will be simple
for Wende and me - just learning the sounds of each
character in the alphabet.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>In school again, I hung out with some
of the students after class.  They were YRUU youth and
<! two of the girls were lying on top of each other in
a close warm way, but not to have sex so much as just
feel good together.> I talked to one girl while she
had her iguana crawling all over the place.  I talked
to her for a while and then realized I was late for my
next class, but I didn't have my books for it, and I
didn't know where it was.</p>

<p class=dream>So I ran back to my locker, trying to
remember by lock combination.  I knew it was one of my
old combinations, either 5-18-5, or 5-30-8.  I found
the locker and it was already open.  I looked for my
books in there as I woke up.</p>

<p>I feel <em>so much</em> better today!  Thank you to
Wende for taking care of me last night.  Thank you to
my body for healing.  Today I *think* is the Super
Bowl and therefore our youth group will be serving
super bowls of soup.  I'll call and find out if today
is in fact that day.</p>

<p>Yes, I will *not* be watching the super bowl.</p>

                        <p class=date>8:16am Saturday 27 January 2001</p>

<p>- - - - earliest dream:</p>

<p class=dream>In front of a school unloading stuff
out of the back of a minivan, and taking care of a
little kid the size of a doll who was inside a small
box.  We were waiting for his parents to come pick him
up maybe.</p>

<p>- - - - earlier dream:</p>

<p class=dream>Helping Jennifer next door, who had
injured her right thigh (same place as Chuck in the
movie last night), I was in her garage helping her try
on clothes.  Actually not *helping* her, but helping
her choose which outfits were appropriate and then she
would go inside her house to try them on.</p>

<p class=dream>She had a little pink dress (little
meaning it was for a five year old) with newsprint
scarf</p>

<p>- - - - most recent dream:</p>

<p class=dream>Driving in my car Scott, in an
unfamiliar traffic filled area, needing to find a
place to wash my car.  I didn't know if I should turn
right or left at the next intersection, but I guessed
right so I turned right and immediately into a parking
lot in front of a row of businesses.</p>

<p class=dream>I found the bays of a wash-it-yerself
carwash and pulled around to the back where a bunch of
peeps were hanging out.  A little kid with them wanted
to see how the carwash worked, and I told him/them
that I needed to wash my car; he could watch me.</p>

<p class=dream>I tried to put a five dollar bill in
the change giver, but the bill was soaking wet and the
machine wouldn't take it.  So I walked over to the
office where the guy had a container of cookies on his
desk.</p>

<p class=dream>I told him I needed quarters, but he
indicated they were entirely out, though he had been
ordering them for 10 days now.</p>

<p class=dream>Out of quarters?  This is news that I
had not heard of - a quarter shortage.</p>

<p class=dream>"Well, can I just pay you five dollars
and you just turn on the washer for me?</p>

<p class=dream>He said he could do that and walked
outside to turn it on.  He went to the gas pump
saying, "maybe this will work," grabbed the gas hose
and pulled it over toward the dollar bill changer,
squirted it with gasoline while he typed a secret code
on a keypad by the bill changer.</p>

<p class=dream>It worked, and though I was a bit
nervous about washing with gasoline all over the
place, I began washing a black vinyl padded office
chair (instead of my car).</p>

<p>I woke up.</p>

I'm sick and don't want to come sneeze or cough on
the air, or on the mic.
 
I *can* come in and will if no one can take the
shift.
 
Tonight 7-9pm Saturday 27 January 2001
 
    Thanks!
    - Rob

<p>My headache is just so icky that I don't want to
move or talk.  I'm going back to bed.</p>

<p>I am sick today for sure.  Bluck.  As Wende pointed
out, I've gotten sick more than she has this winter. 
Interesting.  Normally I don't get sick at all.  I'll
be sleeping a lot today before KTRU tonight.  I still
plan to go.  7pm - 9pm <a
href="https://www.ktru.org/realaudio.html">here</a> you
can listen.  Donna and I are sharing the shift again,
so we are mostly alternating Saturdays, but I will be
taking the next two (tonight and next week).</p>

<p>I'm going to look for chicken noodle soup and then
go back to bed.</p>

<p>Wende and I went to Mission Burrito where lovely
chicken soup helped easy my crazy hunger.  Wende had
tortilla soup.</p>

<p>I relayed a story to her that my brother Fred told
me today when he called, about a guy who tried to sell
a nice Audi on a Stanford only newsgroup where people
normally sell books and microwaves and stuff.  $10
dollar item type things.</p>

<p>I told her the Audi may be better sold in <a
href="https://www.theluxurysource.com">The Robb
Report</a>, and she didn't know what that is.  "It's
where rich people buy and sell things.  They sell
helicopters and islands in The Robb Report."</p>

<p>We tried to check out a copy of it at Superstand,
but they were wrapped in plastic.  No browsing
please.</p>

<p>Sarah joined Ben for a bit during his shift,
creating a Ben and Sarah Show reunion for a while. 
That was fun, and it was made possible by me being
sick.  Sarah is the cutest DJ at KTRU.</p>

<p class=date>6:43am CST Friday 26 January 2001</p>
<p class=note>(dream)</p></p>

<p class=dream>Looking inside an old pachinko machine type thing (*),
like I had the front glass open and could see the mechanism behind the
scenes, and it was not screwed onto its base all the way.  So I
unscreewed it all the way and then had to thread the bolts through the
webbing of Tinkerbell's front paws.  It was painful, but it had to be
done I thought.</p>

<p class=dream>She complained while I was screwing them in, and once
it was finished, I let her go and I could hear her thump thump thump
as she walked, and I realized that it wasn't right; she didn't have to
have them.</p>

<p class=dream>So I tracked her down and found she was trying to chew
at them to get them out.  I began to remove the threaded bolts,
unscrewing unscrewing and it really hurt her this time, but definitely
had to be done and I could see her skin being abraided and ripped due
to the bolt.  Terrible eww.</p>

<p>and I woke up.</p>

<p>(*) I know that's not right, and has a link to a whole 'nother
paragraph of dream, but I'm not sure what...</p>

<p>Tinkerbell is (Wende's) our white cat.</p>

<p class=date>6:54am</p>

<p>doh.  I tried to save this message on my local computer
to send it to my website, but I'm out of space on my hard drive.  I
gotta clean some shit off, and add another drive.</p>
