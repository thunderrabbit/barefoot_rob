<p>Holy Shit!</p>

<p>AAA!</p>

<p>Ok</p>

<p>The Bobbi number on the previous page was wrong!</p>

<p>Hh hh hh hh</p>

<p>OK OKOK</p>

<p>I had been calling 743-7299 and leaving messages.  I called just now and they said it was the wrong number.  Crud.  So I called the Cougar Place
desk and Yay! I had been calling the wrong number.  So I called the right one and woke up Sarah (?) and left my number with her.  So - I have left my
number with someone who sees Bobbi often.  Cool.</p>

<p>Arg- I just called UHPD, and Bobbi is not working Cougar Patrol tonight.  Crap.</p>

<p>Hh hh hhhh</p>

<p>I'm going crazy!!!! OK.</p>

<p>I'm going to the dorms now.  Later.</p>

<p class=date>1:05am Saturday 19 September 1992</p>

<p>"Today" I went to class and then on the way back to the dorms, I saw Celeste near the wading pool, so I played frisbee with her on the rocks and
such for about 15 minutes until she had to meet Elizabeth.  At the end, she said, "Thank you for playing with me."  Cool.</p>

<p>I played in Molly's room for a while and then we went to lunch.  After lunch, I did the big jump from OB ledge to ground over the stairs.  My
sandals locked onto the ground, but my right foot slid forward and out of the sandal and I gouged a flap of skin off my big toe.  We cleaned that up,
and then went to pick up Debbie Forester to go to the movies.  Her roommate, Annabeth was in there and she did the funniest thing.  See, she's prim
and proper (and quite pretty)  She reminds me of Lani as far as looks go.  I noted that she sat down specifically on her bed in a weird way.  As if
trying to hide something.  when she leaned forward a bit, I noted it was her bra or panties or something.  I hit the floor laughing.  I told her, "You
crack me up."  "why?" she asked.  I moved closer to her ear so that the whole world wouldn't hear, (I couldn't care less if everyone heard, but I
didn't want to unneccessarily embarass her) "You picked an interesting location to sit."  She kinda smiled an embarassing-moment-but-oh-well smile and
moved them off her bed.  Then she went to hop in the shower and told me, "You can sit on my bed." So I sat on it and began to bounce a little on it
like a little kid.  She said something like, "Don't wear out my springs," so I asked, "Why do you need them?" just to see her reaction.  She didn't
answer, and Molly &amp; Debbie told me to be nice.  Heh heh.</p>

<p>I'm going to make her loosen up a bit.  After she went with us to Marble Slab last night, she told Molly today, "I really had fun last night."
Cool.  She needs to get out more often.  We went to Coogs Cafe, and Kim bought me supper.  I told Debbie that she should try to baby-sit me.  "I will
just look at you and smile when you tell me to do something, and then I'll run."  She said she would eventually catch me and "spank (my) bottom."</p>

<p>We went to Greenspoint Mall and Kim, Judy &smp; I played frisbee while the others shopped for 20 minutes before our movie started.  Kim &samp; I
did a few flirtations throughout the day, mostly via eye contact.  We watch House Sitter, which I didn't exactly like the ending.  (What about Becky?)
Then Marcel and I played frisbee in an all checkerboard tile walls &smp; concrete ceiling &amp; floor hallway.  We did some cool out bounce shots.  I
love playing frisbee all the time.</p>

<p>Carrie spanked my ass as I leaped past her (she sat on OB wall) from tall OB wall to the short perpindicular OB wall.  She said, "I've always
wanted to spank a perfectly rounded ass."</p>

<p>Now it's 1:35AM 19 Sept 1992.  I'm in Tomball about to go to bed.  "Tomorrow" is HOMEWORK BLOCKADE.  Later.</p>

<p class=date>3:30AM Friday 18 September 1992</p>

<p>Today before school Linda called and said she had a hangover and couldn't come today.</p>

<p>So I went to 104 KRBE &amp; got my 104 Card.  After school, I used it to get Red Hot Chili Peppers' Blood Sugar Sex Magik for $8.99.  Cool.</p>

<p>Then I got a copy of Molly's dorm key made.  It was no sweat.  I just taped the imprinted, "Duplication Prohibited" and took it to the key shop
outside of Sears.  He said, "This type of key will run you $2.99"  Cool.</p>

<p>Then I spent some time just walking around campus with only my frisbee.  "Today" was my day off from homework, so I can do that sort of thing on
Thursdays.  So I walked to Cougar Place and got the phone number of Sarah Pagione (sp), with whom Bobbi-with-braces is staying. It's ext 7299 =
743-7299.  <b>7729</b></p>

<p>Then I walked to the library and talked to Yolanda Washington for a while.  Then I cruised to my class (AI) and then to Molly's to watch the
Simpsons and then to the VAX to chat via internet with Laura Wallace in Chicago, and then to the dorms and we (Molly, Laura, me, Debbie Forester,
Anna Beth (her roommate), Will Smith, Greg Titus, &amp; Kim (his girlfriend) with to Marble Slab.  Molly drove, Laura Shotgun, Greg &amp; Kim in the
trunk and the 4 of us in back seat.  We at at Marble Slab, and I flirted with Tammy, (not Nerenberg) who was working there.   I had her turn 104 on
the radio.  She did, and "Get Ready for This" by 2 Unlimited came on.  Cool!  so she turned it up for me and I loved it.  I told her this song could
not be played loud enough.  Unfortunately, Tammy's boss or supervisor thought it was too loud, so she turned it down.</p>

<p>Tammy stuck her tongue out at her.  Heh heh.  Then I found out Tammy's name and told her mine just before we left.</p>

<p>On the way back, <b>I</b> rode with Kim in the trunk.  She expressed some discomfort with Greg being too religious.  I told her I'm not at all
religious.  She said the same about herself.  So we kinda cuddled and flirted and i invited her to rest her head on my shoulder, which she did.  Cool.</p>

<p>I held/caressed her leg with my right hand and held/caressed her fingers with my left hand.  At the end of the right I thanked her and we agreed it
was enjoyable.  When we got out, it was back to ignore Rob &amp; hang on Greg.</p>

<p>We went to Molly &amp; Laura's &amp; played cards &amp; Jeanine came over so I flirted with her and told her I was really horny.  She said she had
to do homework though.  Crud.</p>

<p>We played cards until 2:AM when I conked out on Molly's bed &amp; they continued playing until about 2:20 AM.  Molly elected me to take Will home,
but I convinced him to just sleep on their bean bag.</p>

<p>On the way out, I met Fred, who was walking from lot 9 after getting home from Tomball, feeding the animals.  We talked about girls &amp; cop car
stories (<a href="https://robnugen.com/cgi-bin/journal.pl?type=all&date=1992/08/28#Heather">page 160</a>) &amp; talked about nothing..</p>

<p>We talked until 2 pretty girls walked by &amp; I said "Good Morning."  They told us it was "3 on the dot."  So we cruised to bed.  Here I am.

<p class="dream">Bobbi was in a class with me and she held my hand during class.  Cool.</p>

<p>Oh - last night Molly said that I will kiss her this semester. Double Cool.</p>

<p class="dream">The dream was set in Mr Reagh's class at 12 or 1am (so I could say "Good Morning,") The lights went out and I immediately held her hand.</p>

<p class=date>11:40PM (Before Midnight!) Wednesday 16 September 1992</p>

<p>Today was a Homework Blockade and I got a bunch done on each of my classes.  Cool.  After my Blockade, Maggie and I talked and flirted a lot.  I
always enjoy alone time with her.  She told me that she has tied up John and eaten apricot preserves off his chest and off "the hardest part of his
body."  We hugged and touched and talked about flirting.  We talked about my burning desire to kiss Bobbi, and Maggie said she told Bobbi I was
looking for her.  Bobbi simply said "OK," since she was apparently in a hurry.  Cool.  I'm totally going to kiss the shit out of her.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I'm going to get my 104 Card from 104KRBE.  It will allow me to get Blood Sugar Sex Magic at Soundwaves for $8.99.  Cool.  I'll also
register for the Moonlight Bicycle Ramble, a bike ride for 5000 people at 2am, October 15th or so.  Total Cool.  I'm also going to try to get a copy
of Molly's key.</p>

<p>First I'm going to meet Linda from Fortran at 9:30AM &amp; introduce her to the VAX and such.  I'll also flirt with her and fun stuff like that.
That is all.</p>

<p>Tammy just called and is doing well.  She's working her ass off at work.  60 hours per week plus classes.  It's fucking incredible.  I've got to
leave for class in 13 minutes &amp; and I'm still naked in bed &amp; I haven't eaten.  Later.</p>

<p>I didn't find her today.  I played with my VAX accounts for 4 hours.  My ST1M5 is my mail account and my COSC18IC is for work - boh LISP and
Fortran.  My fortran account is unused.</p>

<p>I also chatted with Laura via internet.</p>

<p><p>Molly and I went to House of Pies.</p>

<p>I got my Citibank bill from VISA, and they also credited my account for $698.50 for the Nishika Camera shit.  Dude. so I called them to try and
determine if I can keep it no sweat.  The lady gave me the impression that Visa is now waiting for Nishika to send them the money.  Hmmm.  I'm just
going to hang onto it and not spend anything for a while.  Hopefully I can keep it.</p>
