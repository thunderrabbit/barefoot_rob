<p>Woooahhhhhhh!!</p>

<p>A million jillion zillion stars!!!!!</p>

<p>Orion is like, completely coated in stars!  The big dipper is
pointing to a hundred stars, and not just the north star.  Pleiades
have tons of friends to play with!!  The Milky Way is overflowing.</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>I turned off Scott's lights, stood out in the middle of route 64,
just stared skyward.  So incredible.  Saw two shooting stars.</p>

<p>Wheeeee!!!</p>

<p>11 miles from Grand Canyon Village.  I'm tired and going to sleep
for a bit in this entrance to a closed road, right in front of the
"ROAD CLOSED" sign and a pile of discarded snow.</p>

<p>5355.1 miles traveled since Dallas.</p>

<p>Super cold cold cold.  Like negative fifty billion degrees..</p>

<p>B b b b b b b bb b bb b b b b b.....</p>

<p>I'm awake now; wind is blowing fast enough to shake Scott; that's
probably what woke me up.</p>

<p>4045 miles driven so far.  Roll out, again.</p>

<p class=date>2:51am</p>

<p>4045.8 miles driven.  Scott's check engine light came on when
driving up the rest of the hill.  I'm pulled over to the side to check
his oil.</p>

<p class=date>3:14am</p>

<p>Well, the good thing is that I've now packed my bike and bike rack
inside Scott.  And when I restarted him the check englne light is
off.  And it didn't start precipitating until I was about done looking
for oil, and it's not too far to the next city.  I didn't find any
extra oil in Scott's trunk.  Silly, Rob.</p>

<p class=date>3:32am</p>

<p>4056 miles traveled.</p>

<p>I sang Scotty a song on the way down the hill which included
something like, "we can make it / I know we will / there'll be a town
/ at the bottom of this hill"   and sure enough, there's a town at the
bottom of the hill.  With a Chevron station open.  I trust they sell
oil.</p>

<p class=date>3:55am</p>

<p>See?  Was that so hard?  Nope.  I talked to Ron, the cashier at the
Chevron, told him about my trek.  He said "that's a trip I'd like to
take someday: just take the 80 all the way across until it ends near
New York, and then come back... don't have to *go* there.." and I
interrupted him, "it's the *trip* that's the adventure.  I have a
journal online..." and gave him my card.  Cool cat.  Thanks Ron, for
being cool, knowledgeable *and* working in the middle of the
night.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>After I bought two quarts of oil from Ron, I found a quart of oil
under my seat.  Silly silly Rob.</p>

<p class=date>5:25am</p>

<p>Tired.  At a rest stop 4119 miles traveled.  I might sleep.  Might
not.  Probably will.</p>

<p>I did.</p>

<p>4126.5 miles.  Now on 299 headed east between Junction City and
Interstate 5.</p>

<p>Just taking a moment to record light drizzly snow falling, brown
grass visible in patches through the white snow, with oak trees
(maybe) and tall pines (100 feet-ish).  Completely overcast sky with
basically no wind.  Hilly terrain, with lots of twists and turns and
passing lanes uphill and be careful signs downhill.</p>

<p>I've been calling this area indistinguishable from West Virginia,
not that I'm the expert on either area..</p>

<p class=date>9:46am</p>

<p>I'm on I-5 now.  Have been for 15 or 20 minutes maybe.  4194 miles
traveled.  Way overcast, light drizzled drops of water rolling up
Scott's rain-x coated windshield.  129 miles from Sacramento, the
capital of California.</p>

<p>I'm planning to call Sally when I'm next to San Francisco to see if
she can come say HI to me in LA before I jump over to I-40 and head
back east.</p>

<p class=date>9:53am</p>

<p>Wow!!  I just realized that this roadtrip is fulfilling a dream
I've had for a while.  Specifically back in... first year college???
my then penpal Kiera said she was going to take a roadtrip from her
town in Massachusettes down and across the US to Grand Canyon or
something.  She offered to swoop down and pick me up so we could blaze
an adventure together...  It never happened with her, but now I've
done it myself!  Except for the Massachusettes and Grand Canyon part.
Whoohooo!!!  Way to go road trip!!</p>

<p class=date>11:10am</p>

<p>Rest area now.  4287 miles traveled since Dallas.</p>

<p>Um, oh, I remembered that I need to get Sally's stuffed bear back
to her, so I'll be a bit more proactive in getting it returned to her
than just "can you meet me in LA?"</p>

<p>I have a goal of learning "Rabbit Run" by the time I get back to
Dallas.  I think it's one of the most difficult Eminem songs to rap
cause there is no chorus to take a break, and hardly any spots to even
take a breath.  Amazing.  I hope he actually did it and it's not
spliced together.  No matter; I will be able to do it.</p>

<p class=date>11:34am</p>

<p>35 miles from Sacramento now.  Suddenly there is almost no
precipitation.  Just a light coating of fog, or maybe the overcast sky
has landed.</p>

<p class=date>1:11pm</p>

<p>Rest area again.  (Different one.)  This one has temporary
buildings housing the toilets.  And it's one of the most crowded I've
seen on my trek.</p>

<p>4402.9 miles traveled since Dallas.  152904 miles on Scott.</p>

<p class=date>3:01pm</p>

<p>4515 miles.</p>

<p>Suddenly from 70 mph we are now going 20.  200 miles from LA so
(hopefully (haha (eeEEee))) it's not LA traffic.</p>

<p class=date>3:29pm</p>

<p>At a gas station now. (the traffic jam above lasted only 2 miles,
and I could see no apparent reason except maybe drivers were gawking
at people picking fruit in a field and putting it on wagon
things.)</p>

<p>4543.9 miles.</p>

<p>4545 miles traveled.  I've just left an Exxon/Subway/TCBY after
getting gas across the street for 2 cents cheaper per gallon (1.559),
but when I went in to get snacky mcsnacks, they wanted 75 cents for
each of their candy bars, plus they had a crummy selection (No Reese's
Pieces!) so I went across the street to the combo platter food
extravaganza.</p>

<p>Decided to actually take a moment to sit and eat, so I got a
sandwich at Subway, a Veggie Delite.  I thought it was the fake vegi
meat things, but no.  It's just vegetables.  Which sucks for me cause
I only get lettuce and tomatoes.  Bang, got my sandwich and there's
(basically) no protein on it.</p>

<p>Talk to the preparer and she has no clue about these mysterious
veggie patties I'm requesting.  So I talk to a manager type cat who at
the time was working at the TCBY.  He was all, "yeah, those Veggie
Patties didn't sell well enough; I'd buy a case of 36 per week and use
6 in a week and have to throw the rest away."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't want to pay five dollars for lettuce and tomato.."</p>

<p>"What can we do?" he asked, not like, "what can we do to make it
right," but more like, "we are helpless to help you." "You have
already purchased the product; I cannot take it back."</p>

<p>Then "what do you want to do?" (this time with the implicit "to
make it better?")</p>

<p>"Gimme a free ice cream."</p>

<p>This he did without hesitation, though he didn't fill the cup full
enough for me if I had been paying for it outright.  I am surprised at
this; I figure the cup costs more than the ice cream, especially
considering the ice cream will have to be tossed at the end of the
night anyway (soft serve machine)</p>

<p>He went on to explain how I should have inquired as to what was
"Veggie Delite" before ordering it, and that the fault was in my
misconception of the menu, not in their lack of carrying a product.</p>

<p>I can imagine better customer service.</p>

<p>He then said that the giving of ice cream was a good faith gesture,
nothing to do with [correcting my displeasure with] the sandwich.  So
of course I immediately think, <em>well, then what will you give me to
fix the sandwich silliness?</em></p>

<p>Whatever.</p>

<p>No, be nice.  So I gave him my adventure card.  Learned his name:  Raj.</p>

<p>I gotta respect that he's presumably working hard to keep these two
storefronts open.  Good job, Raj.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>So I ate my lettuce and tomato sandwich (with provolone) then
topped off my DR Pepper and went to get some snacks.  They wanted 79
cents for candy bars!  Four cents more than across the street, which I
was trying to escape in the first place!</p>

<p>So I didn't get any candy at all.  Just 59 cents for Nature Valley
granola bars.</p>

<p class=date>4:41pm</p>

<p>4565 miles traveled.</p>

<p>Muwahahahahahaaaa!!!</p>

<p>I have now seen where I-10 dumps into the ocean.  I had previously
only been on I-10 as far as Palm Springs.  (Not driving! but when I
flew to Con Con 1998, I also visited Jennifer in Palm Springs, and
part of the adventure included me driving on I-10)</p>

<p>They have an amusement park to celebrate I-10's arrival at the
Pacific!  Right here in Santa Monica.  Whoohooo!!!</p>

<p class=date>9:49pm</p>

<p>4789 miles traveled.</p>

<p>Got lost in Santa Monica, but too tired to totally enjoy it.</p>

<p class=date>10:08pm</p>

<p>Trying to get out of Santa Monica, following the 1 and
suddenly... <em>BANG!</em> without warning I end up at LAX!  Los
Angeles International Airport???  Woah!</p>

<p>I had no idea it was so close to Santa Monica.  I got a bit lost in
the airport area, but now after a glance at the map I think I'm set.
105 to 405 and I'll be back on a familiar freeway.</p>

<p class=date>10:54pm</p>

<p>After 70 - 80 mph LA driving on crowded 405 (I could get used to
this style of driving), I'm at Sally's aptartment complex.  If she's
not home, I'll go to Kinko's and upload all these entries.</p>

<p>4842 miles since Dallas.</p>

<p>Approximately 800 miles today.  (797)</p>

<p>Just climbed (drove up) a mountain about 90 miles north of LA.  I
wonder how high it is.  Getting gas now.</p>

<p>(actually I just need to pee and am getting gas to be nice.)</p>

<p class=date>6:07pm</p>

<p>Awww man.  No restrooms working at that gas station, so I came
across the street and *these* are out too!  "What's up with the
restrooms?"  "Water main is out; it broke yesterday from freezing."</p>

<p>D'oh!</p>

<p>And this cat wants 79 cents for Reese's Pieces, too.  Mannnnn.</p>

<p>4144 feet.</p>

<p class=date>6:42pm</p>

<p>4686 miles traveled.  <em>now</em> I'm in the LA traffic jam. and
it's 36 miles to LA according to the sign.</p>

<p class=date>7:06pm</p>

<p>Fuck that noise.  I turned around to take the exit that some signs
encouraged due to the traffic.  I'm on 126 now and will basically take
the 1 to Newport Beach.</p>

<p>4695 miles traveled.</p>

<p class=date>7:32pm</p>

<p>Ahhhhhh.</p>

<p>Working restroom in the Chevron in Fillmore, California, corner of
126 and 23.  *And* Reese's Pieces for 70 cents each, *including tax*.</p>

<p>Dat's what I'm talkin' about.</p>

<p>4714 miles traveled.</p>

<p class=date>8:34pm</p>

<p>Super twisty mc twisting up around this big mountainy area with
practically no reflectors (definitely no street lights) and beautiful
houses overlooking beautiful overlooks.  Gotta be a movie star
neighborhood here.</p>

<p>Ohhh and one is for sale.  Can't see the house, but I see the sign:
310-589-2461 Barbara Horton selling a property on 23 south.</p>

<p>Amazing houses on 23.  4749 miles traveled.  Curves everywhere very
little traffic.  Beautiful starry sky.  </p>

<p class=date>8:40pm</p>

<p>Another property.  This one at address 4100 south 23.  310-990-2079
Matt Ogden.</p>

<p>Buy one of these properties and tell the realator to give me a
finder's fee, and with the fee I'll throw you a house warming
party!</p>

<p>Sally was home!  A good clue was her living room light on.</p>

<p>We chatted; I showered; she showed me pictures from her Houston
trip (she just got back today); we watched the last story in
<em>Amores Perros</em>.</p>

<p>Now it's bedtime and couchtime for Sally and I, respectively.</p>

<p>Oh my gosh what a cutie at this gas station.  Red hair and
<em>braces</em>.  Oh so cute!</p>

<p class=date>8:30pm</p>

<p>My god.  It's been an hour and I'm still fixating on that cute
woman.  I should have said something, <em>anything</em> to her.  Well
I did, but didn't give her my card.  I coulda asked her how to get to
the freeway or said I'm on a roadtrip, or fucking anything.  Yargh.
Why was I so scared to do that?</p>

<p class=date>9:53pm</p>

<p>Okay.  I seem to have kinda sorta thought of some reasons to get
over it.  The best two are (!) trust the universe.  (@) there's lots
of cute people that go by all the time in cars, but I don't know it
cause I can't see them.</p>

<p>Whatever.</p>

<p>I've now traveled 4045 miles since Dallas.  I'm at a Vista on 299,
some miles east of 101 in California (about 50 or so miles south of
Redwood Forest I'm guessing).  Time for sleeeep.</p>

<p>Haha 333 miles traveled today.</p>
