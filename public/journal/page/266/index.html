<p>Lin and I went on an impromptu date tonight, first visiting the ramen place adjacent to Kawasaki station, but turning away from its 20 minute line.</p>

<p>We were going to go to the cheap and delicious Chinese place with the cute-nosed waitress, but then I suggested we try Taro&rsquo;s restaurant.  Taro stands out on the corner soliciting customers, and has a super genki personality that piqued my curiosity enough to try the place.  Plus he speaks English (and German, and Spanish,) and Japanese.</p>

<p>4000 yen for not enough to fill us is not enough to bring us back again.  Sorry, Taro.</p>

<p>SO, we went to the Chinese place to get ramen and gyoza.  The cute girl wasn&rsquo;t there!!!  I was glad she had a day off (she always seems to be there when we&rsquo;re there), but then she came back a bit after we arrived.  Yay!  I mean boo!  I mean Yay!!</p>

<p>Today at work I stopped trying to convert my code into a <a href="https://marionettejs.com">Marionette</a> app; I just don&rsquo;t seem to have enough smerts to do it yet.  I&rsquo;m gonna try again tomorrow, making a Marionette app from scratch.  Well, from a semi blank js slate, so hopefully it will go a bit more easily.</p>

<p>The code I&rsquo;ve got so far uses <a href="https://backbonejs.org">Backbone</a> to do some pretty sweet ajax compared to writing all the ajax queries in <a href="https://jquery.com">jQuery</a>.  The page lets the user create WHERE clauses for a report.  Buttons along the top have table names on them.  Selecting one (hmmm maybe I should make them a select list, cause there will be several(?) other tables added)..
Selecting one tells the page to create a dropdown list of most of the fields in the table.  Selecting a field from the dropdown list converts the View to the selected field name, an appropriate operator dropdown, and an empty text field for the user-supplied value.</p>

<p>Each of these are the components of my WHERE clause.  Each change is saved automagically to disk, so reloading the page reloads all the elements in their same states.  I don&rsquo;t yet have a GUI for grouping fields for OR and AND within the WHERE clause, but the backend supports this through something I&rsquo;ve called groups.  Each same-numbered group are all joined with ORs and then distinct groups are connected with ANDs.</p>

<p>Tomorrow&rsquo;s page will allow the selection of fields for the SELECT portion of the query.  It&rsquo;s this page that I intend to create as a Marionette app from the start.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I wrapped Lin&rsquo;s gift quite thoroughly.  It&rsquo;s got at least 5 layers, two of which are bound with twine made of twine or plastic fibers.  I still need to put the outer layer of wrapping on it.  I considered mailing it to Fred so he could mail it back, but that would more than double the price.  It would be funny, but not worth it just to confuse Lin as to the gift&rsquo;s origin.</p>

<p>Lin and I watched the Kill Bills today.  She enjoys movies a lot; one of her ways of enjoying them is falling asleep in front of them.  Apparently she had seen the opening scene of Kill Bill, but didn&rsquo;t remember any of the rest.</p>

<p>I prodded her awake as needed and she quite enjoyed the movies!</p>

<p>Not <em>this</em> URL, but this one: <a href="https://longbets.org/601/">https://www.longbets.org/601/</a>, or so the bettor suggests.  I&rsquo;m sure the URL will work fine, along with its friend <a href="https://longbets.org/601/">https://longbets.org/601/</a> as well as future URIs in to-be-developed retrieval systems.</p>

<p>Anyway, I just thought the bet was interesting, so I took a couple screenshots.</p>

<p>I wonder if the <a href="https://robnugen.com/blog/2012/11/24/this-url-will-not-exist-in-2022">URL for this blog entry</a> will still work; I&rsquo;ve been debating ditching Wordpress for another home built system, perhaps using an upgraded version of my old system.  Still want a nice way to host images with automagic resize based on URL parameters.</p>

<p>Lin asked me tonight if I planned to buy the gift she wanted for Christmas.</p>

<p><a href="/images/2012/11/Screen-Shot-2012-11-22-at-11.03.06-PM.png"><img src="/images/2012/11/Screen-Shot-2012-11-22-at-11.03.06-PM.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t tell Lin, but I ordered it two days ago.  I didn&rsquo;t tell her tonight because that&rsquo;s not much of a Christmas surprise if I tell her now!   It was a bit difficult not to tell her, but I was able to convince her that I planned not to buy it with responses like, &ldquo;what are ya gonna do with it anyway, but just put it on the shelf?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hi Rob,</p>

<p>I noticed you&rsquo;ve shared Grooveshark (<a href="https://grooveshark.com/">https://grooveshark.com/</a>) on this page <a href="https://robnugen.com/blog/2012/11/22/digging-through-tutorial/">https://robnugen.com/blog/2012/11/22/digging-through-tutorial/</a>, as you are no doubt aware, Grooveshark actually closed down back in 2015.</p>

<p>We’ve put together a guide to the best alternatives in 2017. Here’s the link - <a href="https://comparitech.net/limewire-grooveshark-alternative">https://comparitech.net/limewire-grooveshark-alternative</a></p>

<p>Perhaps you could update your page to include a link to our guide so that anyone still interested in Grooveshark has an alternative.</p>

<p>I hope this helps.</p>

<p>I wish I could show the code I wrote, but I can show <a href="https://jonahlyn.heroku.com/blog/2011/12/02/backbone-drag-and-drop">Jonahlyn&rsquo;s backbone drag-and-drop tutorial</a> from where I got ideas for the drag and drop part.</p>

<p>Making the reporting system for AB, I&rsquo;ve got backbone driving the data to the server with each change made by the user.</p>

<p>User can click [buildings] or [units] button to add where components to the search.  The buttons will create a select list with all the fields of that table, plus save the where component to disk.  When the select field is selected, it changes to the name of the field + an operator dropdown + an empty field, then writes the field selection to disk.  When the operator is selected, it gets written to disk.  When the user enters data in the field, it gets written to disk.  When user sorts the where components, the changes are written to disk.</p>

<p><a href="https://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a>, I think I love you.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m starting to look at <a href="https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette">Marionette</a>.  I found a <a href="https://davidsulc.com/blog/2012/05/06/tutorial-a-full-backbone-marionette-application-part-1/">tutorial on Marionette</a>; apparently it can make a <a href="https://davidsulc.github.com/backbone.marionette-atinux-books/#search/Neuromarketing">neat little bookshelf webapp</a>.  As I start digging into the tutorial, <a href="https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/38073/is-there-a-cdn-for-backbone-marionette">I wonder if there&rsquo;s a CDN for Marionette</a>.</p>
