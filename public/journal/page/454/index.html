<p>Walked with Lisa around her old neighborhood and heard such
beautiful stories about how she helped her friends convert some
abandoned trolley tracks into a community garden, which now (14 years
later) boasts beautiful trees, benches, irrigation system, and the
blessing by the city now as a National Historic District or something
equally cool.</p>

<p>We walked up and down its length - maybe 1.25 miles, which has been
extended since Lisa last worked on it.  Oh, one thing that really made
me go "wow" is Lisa was all, "I planted that tree for Julie, and I
planted that tree for Hannah and that tree for Addie."  The kids have
<em>trees!</em>  That is so so cool.</p>

<p>Walked around Rhodes College, surrounded by a big fence and many
acres of lush grass and trees.  It's a very expensive private college
according to Lisa.</p>

<p>Heard stories of the community of neighbors and who lived where and
who divorced whom and who sold houses and who rented houses..  Just an
ornate collage of stories all set in this beautiful old neighborhood.</p>

<p>I could hardly describe how cool I thought it is that Lisa helped
build this beautiful thing for her community.  "This counts as
building something for the world," I said referencing the input
Richard Unger gave me a couple years ago.</p>

<p>Such an awesome walk.</p>

<p>We're at Julie's soccer game now.  Hannah and I have shared flag
duty.  Score is tied 3-3 now I think.  It's 4th quarter.  Actually
Hannah and Antonella are doing flag duty together.  Antonella has the
flag and is running behind Hannah who has been telling her which way
to point.  Antonella is about 5 or 6 it looks like.</p>

<p>After spaghetti dinner at church, as a fundraiser for the junior
high, we played random object throwing games (bouncy ball, soccer
ball, ultimate disc) in the field.  Eventually it turned into a game
of ultimate.  Totally my pleasure to help introduce the game to so
many eager kids.  I'm impressed with how quickly they embraced the
game, and were just <em>playing</em> ultimate and having turnovers all
over the place, but everyone knowing what was going on, never
surprised at what team had the disc and why.  Okay, the concept is
simple, but these are mostly 8-11 year olds.  I was impressed.</p>

<p>Funny was a kid about 3 years old who <em>really</em> wanted to
play and have someone throw the disc to him, so I did and he caught it
and it hit him in the lower lip, so his expression when he causght it
was priceless.  I interpreted it as, "I'm happy that I caught it, but
that hurt.  Am I happy or sad here?  Wow that wasn't quite as fun as I
had hoped!"  I knelt in front of him and checked his mouth.  Little
bit of blood.  Lisa escorted him off field to his mom.</p>

<p>Two brothers were there - Johnny and Jacob.  Jacob was about 4
years old and really trying so hard to be as big as his brother who
would taunt the shit out of him or worse, ignore him.  I talked to
Jacob a lot and helped him learn how to catch the frisbee with two
hands alligator style instead of trying to catch it with both arms
underneath like a holding a blanket.</p>

<p>He did quite well catching after that.  I'm hoping my being nice to
him helps erase my bad karma of kicking my little brother's butt when
we were little.</p>

<p>Three, no four cats came to unclog the sewer line today.  It was
interesting in the way that watching someone dig a 6 foot hole, cut a
pipe, pull out tree roots, replace and reseal the pipe, fill up the
hole is interesting, but with one detail extra.</p>

<p>The guy named Dickie was so funny!  It started as he was in the
hole smoking a cigarette that he just held in his mouth and hadn't
ashed for a full inch and then he just threw it on the ground and
said, "get outta here, you're killin' me."</p>

<p>He made little video game sounds as he dug and tossed dirt.  He'd
say "moosh moosh moosh" every time he mushed some dirt or mud.  "Hey
where'd my gloves go?   Oh I gottem on I just couldn't tell with all
the dirt on 'em."</p>

<p>"Help me!  I dug myself into a hole and can't get out!"</p>

<p>Out of the hole he pulled out a cigarette. "Well, I decided to
start smokin' again."</p>

<p>As they were filling in the hole, replanting the shrubbery (no
herrings) and flowers, he mimicked a spouse, "honey, are you sure they
worked on the sewer?  I can't tell a difference!"</p>

<p>He was funnnny funny funny.</p>

<p>Just called Swa'Vet, who I met during production of Dirty Third II,
produced by Wreckshop Records.  She gave me a bunch of phone numbers
of different production companies and record labels and all sorts of
shit.  I'll probably call none of them, except maybe to find an
address for Eminem, but hey I have them just in case.</p>

<p>At the end of our convo, she was all, "write me a card or some
shit; don't fuck around and don't do it, aight?"</p>

<p>"Shit, you can even draw a picture on a piece of paper and send
that to me I don't care just send me somethin'"</p>

<p>She is so funny!!</p>

<p>Okay, today I'm going to work on redesigning Kim's website and the
way the whole thing works, to make it easier for him to update content
on the site.</p>

<p class=date>11:54am</p>

<p>Hmmm.  Unless I'm missing something big, I think I've gotten the
basics of this site redesigned.  I will use regexp techniques that
Fred taught me when he wrote my new journal index thing.</p>

<p>I checked my email and Calder sent an urgent message yesterday
asking me to contact her.  From her livejournal, I think she may have
been kicked out of her house.  I emailed her back and gave her the
phone number where I'm staying.  I hope/trust that the number won't be
abused.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>At a Wal-mart, outside in the parking lot and sorta
loitering there waiting for them to open because they were closed
having an employee only meeting.  I packed my stuff up and my backpack
was too light; my computer wasn't in it.  I freaked a bit and went
into the front of the store in an attempt to walk through and get my
coputer that I thought I had left on the other side of the building,
but some employee was all, "I'm sorry sir, blah blah blah" and I tried
to be all polite and went back out and ran around the store and I
heard him call me so I turned around but he didn't see me, thinking
that I had already gone around, so he went back inside, and I
<em>ran</em>, trying to get around the entire store before he was able
to walk through the center.  and some woman came out, "all "you forgot
your computer over by the loading dock" and I was all, "I assure you I
did <em>not</em> forget it; I was coming back here right now to get
it." and she was all, "fine" and then I started cussing and just let
my inner Slim Shady throw anger out into the world cause I was so mad
that someone would think I might forget my computer somewhere or that
I would not know exactly where it was at all times.</p>

<p class=dream>Some cats from KTRU were there to comfort me - Ben, and
some new DJs, like freshmen who I had never previously met.  I hugged
Ben all bigly and thanked him for his support.  His eyes teared a
little bit and then Maggie was there and asked how I was doing and I
told her an overwiew and then I realized I had missed my job starting
date with Star Pizza or Amy's Ice Cream and that I had just been
having so much fun that I forgot to go back to them on a certain
Monday tahat I said I would.</p>

<p class=dream>I woke up with Eminem lyrics in my head "y'all are
steady tryin' to drown a shark"</p>

<p>Picked up Hannah from school and then went to the mall for a bit
before picking up Addie from school, but I didn't have shoes so Lisa
gave me her Tae Kwon Do foot cover things to wear!  They're made of
that shiny foam-ish stuff that I've seen life vests made of, and they
just cover the top of the feet!  This is the perfect disguise for my
bare feet to walk around in the mall.</p>

<p>We stopped by a shoe store where Hannah was looking for purple
Converse, but we instead just conversed with the well-pierced
employee, who had most of his piercings hidden or pulled out.  He was
rather entertained by us since we were also playing Don't Bite The
Grape, in which players all have a single grape in their mouth and, as
the name of the game suggests, don't bite it.  Lisa would bite hers
after like 2 seconds.  We gave her another grape, and then another,
and then she chose a tiny pea-sized grape that was easier for her to
ignore.  Hannah and I of course didn't even consider her in the game
anymore.</p>

<p>Hannah and I did rather well, until mine fell out of my mouth and
broke on the floor.  I used the 3 second rule to eat it, but there was
a hair on it.  Eww.  Oh well.</p>

<p>After what might be called Sister Fight Night at dinner, with Addie
and Julie bickering, and then Julie and Hannah bickering, we had the
most outstanding fun this evening bouncing on the trampoline: Lisa and
Julie and I boucing in the rain of the hurricane Isador (?) (why oh
why do they start over every year with A on naming the hurricanes?
This makes it so infrequent to have a hurricane Rob or hurricane
Yolanda and hurricane Zoolander rip up the coastline of some city...)
and then jumping into the hot tub and then back on the trampoline and
back in the hot tub..  So much fun!  The mat of the trampoline was
super slick, so it was easy to fall and possibly a tad more dangerous
than we might oughta have been out there bouncing around in the rain,
but it was oh so much fun!</p>

<p>Went inside around 9:30 to chat with Calder, who wanted to talk
about stuff.  I hope I was helpful for her.</p>

<p>I'm at fuckin' Kinko's in Memphis (yes, still thankful for free
internet connection) but I'm feeling pissed that I can't seem to get
anything done on this website I'm working on (spiritblueeagle.com).
I need to fuckin' revamp how the files are being displayed in a fucked
up way, but I can't seem to concentrate or anything remotely
resembling something helpful toward that end.</p>

<p>Part of it may be that I have music blasting in my headhpones from
my ever expanding mp3 collection, but usually that keeps me focused so
I don't know what the fuck is up.</p>

<p>Have I forgotten how to concentrate on shit since I've been on
vacation?  Should I just give up and quit trying to fuck with this?
Should I start from square one and redesign the whole fuckin' thing?
That option keeps looking better and better each time I try to fuck
with this shit, but I'm like dammm I don't really want to do that and
risk fucking it all up worse.  And another thing is that it's fucking
hard as shit to piss around on this website because I don't have
telnet access to it, only ftp, and that means I have to make my
changes locally and then ftp them up, but the ftp connection times out
at 300 seconds, so if I concentrate for more than 5 minutes on this
bitch then I have to refucking log in and move to the correct
directory which is minimum 15 keystrokes just to get to the directory
I need to be in.  Pissy pissy shit.</p>

<p>So I toyed with the idea of moving all the shit to my website,
which means I'll have to keep track of a different set of changes to
take into consideration the different directory structure on the two
systems (/web/cgi-bin vs /home/rob/public_html/cgi-local) and that
adds an extra layer of suckage to it.</p>

<p>Whine whine whine.  I just want to get this shit fucking done so I
don't have to fuck with it anymore.  All I really got to do is make
the shit simple for Kim to edit his own content on his website.  And
there's no real due date, so I have to make my own artificial deadline
to get this shit done.</p>
