<p>Enough is just that; I&rsquo;m going to leave my computer for a bit.  I
wrote the 03today.html entry this morning and had a reference to my
days old counter.  Last night, I swear it was working, but today it is
not.  Some problem with not being able to run an applet from within
the cgi-local directory.  Hmmm.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll ponder it later; but right now I&rsquo;m going to work on my mountain
fountain!</p>

<p>Oh, also today I had to scrape together cash to pay for the ashford.com
stock I bought yesterday.  I am right now resisting looking up their
market value.   good job!</p>

Subject:  not gettin&rsquo; a bike
To:       thunderrabbitATcheerfulDOTcom</p>

<p>G -</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s becoming more apparent that I could greatly benefit from having a
bike here on campus.  Campus is 2-3 times bigger than that of UH&rsquo;s, and
I have to walk quite a bit to get from my dorm (thankfully not situated
along the perimiter of campus) to the engineering building (about a
12-minute walk across the center of campus) or the math building (about
4-5 minutes away from the eng building, and 8-10 from my dorm) or the
place where I eat dinner (about 7-9 minutes away from my dorm, 15-17
minutes from the eng building, and 18-20 minutes from the math building).
(Now draw a map.  Assume every path is a line segment; assume my walking
speed is a constant small enough that the curvature of the earth and
topography of ground level are negligible.)</p>

<p>I had wanted to get a BMX bike I could do tricks on like I see some of the
neighborhood kids doing occasionally: hopping up onto two-foot benches,
hopping up onto them so that they land&ndash;stopped&ndash;on their back tire
perched on the corner of the thing and then bounce once or twice before
hopping backward off it again; hopping up, riding along the bench, then
flipping a 180 off the other end, riding backwards&ndash;and pedaling
backwards, just for effect; flatfoot bunnyhopping sideways up onto the
bench; fuckin&rsquo; cool stuff.</p>

<p>But I don&rsquo;t have time to teach myself those tricks.  I need something
cool that won&rsquo;t fall by the wayside: a unicycle.  Not a single one have I
seen yet.  There&rsquo;re characters riding all kinds of shit: bikes, concept
bikes, rollerblades, normal skateboards, big ol&rsquo; long skateboards, tiny
two-wheeled contraptions that are crosses between skateboards and
scooters, but no unicycles.  That will all change.</p>

<p>Hopefully it won&rsquo;t take long to learn to ride.</p>

<p>Gotta go.  It&rsquo;s time to get back to work.</p>

<p><p>Work was cool (and short) today.  I worked some on my website and
suddenly realized, &ldquo;yipes!!  We haven&rsquo;t given notice to our T1 line
account!&rdquo;  Our account is supposed to expire on 31 December.  In our
contract it says that we have to give 30 days notice that we want it
to expire, otherwise the account will be renewed.  How about 28 days?
I don&rsquo;t think they will have a problem with letting it expire; there
is no real gain for them to be asses about it.  Faxed a letter to them
and I expect all will be good.</p>

<p><p>Dude IMed me and was all, &ldquo;hey Amazon.com bought $10 million in
shares of Ashford.com&rdquo; Dude works at Ashford.com.  &ldquo;Really? brb,&rdquo; I
said.</p>

<p><p>I bought 10 shares of Ashford.com at 19 <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> per share plus $12
commission.  We&rsquo;ll see what happens.</p>

<p><p>Left work early to work on the <a
href="https://www.heartstormproductions.com">Techno Cosmic Mass</a>
Water Altar..  We had a meeting down at Ares Robotics, where most of
the work is being done.  Realistically, we are way behind schedule;
the thing is happening this Thursday!  I will build a mountain for my
fountain this weekend.  Gotta buy some rocks too.</p>

<p><p>Took Madeline home after the meeting and talked (listened) to her
for an hour or two, including the drive to her house.  Kept very clear
sexual boundaries, with which I am pleased.</p>

<p><p>Home by about 8:30pm and worked on my site.  I moved my <a
href="/y2k">Y2K</a> survey here, and my novel <a
href="/writings/thepin"><em>The Past Is Now</em></a>, and maybe something
else..</p>

<p><p>Wende brought Taco Bell home for dinner and slept on the couch until I got off the computer at like 1am.</p>

<p><p>Truly I am a slave to my website!  But I love it!</p>

<p>Wow.  so close to 2000!!!!!!!</p>

<p>Tonight Wende and I went to Molly and Will&rsquo;s house (where Maggie
and John are living while their house is being built).  The boys
were gone, so after munching some yummy lasagna, we put lights
and decorations up on the tree and watched Mall Rats.  We had
just previously watched Clerks, with which I was not very
impressed, but they promised me I would like Mall Rats better.<br />
My official vote is that Mall Rats is better than clerks, but
mostly just at the end.  The first half was not that great.</p>

<p>I told Maggie I want to learn to dance like Jay (of Jay and Silent Bob)</p>

<hr />

<p>&ldquo;Today&rdquo; (Wednesday) I turned in my 50th CD reviewed at KTRU!<br />
It was for a band called S.O.L.O. and the CD is <em>Out is In</em>.
  I certainly enjoyed it; I found it smooth and jazzy with a
little hint of turntablism and electronica.  Nice album.</p>

<p>I think I might put my KTRU reviews on here.  I&rsquo;ve got most
of them saved on disk.</p>

<hr />

<p>Speakin&rsquo; of KTRU, at KTRU on Thursday (Thanksgiving), I subbed
for someone from 3-5pm.  I got a call from a woman named Donna,
who used to work college radio at A&amp;M back when she was a
student there!  She called just to say, &ldquo;someone is listening&rdquo;
and that she used to work Thanksgiving back in the day.</p>

<p>Turns out she is a local professional DJ!  Cool!  We have
exchanged a couple of emails, but nothing astonishing.  I did
enjoy having <em>someone</em> call just to say my Turkey Day efforts
were being heard!</p>

<hr />

<p>What else?&hellip;  Oh!  Wende is working at The Container Store, and
she had some shelves (elfa) handed down to her, and she has
handed them down to me!  Now I have some nice white shelves on my
living room wall.. So far I have only placed my high school and
college yearbooks on there, plus Volumes 1 - 9 of my written diaries.</p>

<hr />

<p>At work I got a raise!!  Yay!  Now I&rsquo;m making $18.70 per hour.
Very sweet.  Debt, I&rsquo;m coming to kick your ass!!   Today I wrote
some JavaScript (actually I just cleaned up my boss&rsquo; code) that
he will use on some projects.  I wrote the original code; he messed
with it and couldn&rsquo;t quite get it to do all he wanted; I cleaned it
up and got it all straight.</p>

<p>I also wrote some code that will check some forms for completeness
before allowing the user to submit the information to us.  This is
made more interesting because we actually are using SAS to read a
database and write the HTML/Javascript to create the form/check the
form.  Fun stuff.</p>

<p>Oh, and our new DSL line is almost here.  The circuit should be
installed by December 7th, and we should be live a few days after.
I&rsquo;m pretty excited to have this new experience - I will be switching
all the IP addresses in our NT network, plus in our Free BSD unix box
and teaching the router how to filter packets as a firewall, and
all kinds of stuff.</p>

<p>Once this is stable, we&rsquo;ll be beefing up our web server to actually
be two separate machines - one for processing requests, and the other
just as a file server.  Soon thereafter we will bump that up to
two parallel web servers and the 1 file server using a RAID Array.</p>

<ul>
<li>- - techno babble complete - - -</li>
</ul>

<p>Oh, and soon as I get my website happy on my new ISP, I&rsquo;ll begin
diverting traffic over here.</p>

<p>Okay; I&rsquo;ve just transcribed about 4 days worth of stuff onto my site.
Mostly from the end of November, all transcribed from my diary.</p>

<p>My goal is to get the front page of my site set up tomorrow and begin
directing traffic over here.  It&rsquo;s time to quit putzing around with this
thing and actually move away from Geocities!</p>

<p>Have a great night and stuff!</p>

                        <p>Okay, I&rsquo;m moving my site again.  Even though it was never totally moved
in the first place.  However, this new ISP <a href="https://www.webquarry.com/cgi-bin/webrefer.cgi?wquser=rob">webquarry.com</a> seems like it
will be a much happier place for my site to live.  I&rsquo;m messing with a lot
of perl stuff, and the other ISP just wasn&rsquo;t conducive (sp) to easy perl
writing.  I asked them if I could have access to the error output of my
perl scripts and the answer I got was, &ldquo;if you have an error in your script,
you just need to have someone who knows perl go over your code with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>WHAT???</p>

<p>I tried again to explain that I wasn&rsquo;t asking for them to fix my code, just
give me the output.</p>

<p>He understood what I meant and suggested the same thing.</p>

<p>Tsk.  That began the end of my dealings on that ISP.</p>

<hr />

<p>The cost is a bit more here at webquarry, but I have access to the logs!
And I have a shell account!  And I get helpful customer service!!!</p>

<p class=note>(transcribed from my diary)</p>

<p>Wende and I are at Family Planning Center for HIV tests.  Went to
Container Store and got shelf stuff for my new shelves!!!  So very
exciting!  Signed up for webquarry.com to host robnugen.com and will
hopefully leave it here for a long time.  Should be able to have cool
perl scripts and have access to my perl error logs!  I haven&rsquo;t written
any journal entries for a while - not since 24 Nov 1999.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty caught up in here and I can just transcribe them but I have a
concern about writing all kinds of sex stuff on my site.  I asked for
Wende&rsquo;s opinion and she was all, &ldquo;isscool with me; just don&rsquo;t describe
anything explicitly.&rdquo;   That makes sense.</p>

<p>There are more considerations, of course - mainly who will read them.
In some parts of our lives we are role models to youth, and I know some
of them read my site.  This is the real me, guys.  Advisors are people
too.</p>

<p class=note>(transcribed from my diary)</p>

<p>Friday I wasted time at the computer pretty much all day until 5-7pm
when I DJed at KTRU, covering for Jonathan and Sabrina.  After the show,
drove to Marcel and Kayse&rsquo;s for Thanksgiving Party.  Wende was
there and I drove her back with me to KTRU from 11pm to 1am covering for
Tejus MK Ultra show.</p>

<p>After MK Ultra, I dropped Wende off at my apartment and I
went back out to Montrose Radio <a
href="http:www.firstamendmentradio.org">www.firstamendmentradio.org</a>
which is rebroadcast illegally in Houston on 94.9fm with a 35 watt
transmitter.</p>

<p>Saturday Wende and I got up and wrote To Do lists and I cleared my table
(big success on my part) and then we put some shelves up in her apt.
Then to Molly and Will&rsquo;s (where Maggie and John are living while their
house is being built) and watched Clerks.  (I give it a 50% rating) Then
rode with Will and John to play Ultimate at UH (every Saturday night).</p>

<p>Played three games (won 1) and then Wende arrived just before we started
game 4, which my team barely won!  Sweet victory; I was so tired.  Wende
drove us to her apartment where we spent the night and where I am now
while she&rsquo;s at church.</p>

<p>Clerks had a positive affect on (effect in) my life:  I am now more
committed to Wende, who would bring me lasagna to work (or steamed
broccoli).  I have been pestering Wende so crazy much for sex.  I
suddenly realized last night how self-centered my life is.  Also, I want
to make
my apartment more livable and hospitable for myself and others.  Right
now (and for the past 8 years (not including when girlfriends lived with
me) since Tammy moved out) it has been a dumpy bachelor pad.  I&rsquo;m kinda
shifting toward keeping it fixed up and cleaned up.  Is this a new era
in my life?</p>

<p>.

<p>Last night while talking with Wende I expressed how I felt self centered
and too pestery for sex and that I wanted that to change in my life.
The dialogue was great; I want to continue it as far as we can.</p>

<p>We went to Family Planning clinic for HIV tests on Tuesday, but the
tester was on vacation so we made appointments for this coming Tuesday
at 4 and 4:30pm.  The test will be free (next week only; it&rsquo;s usually
$5) and results in 2 weeks.</p>

<p>Tossing around in bed this morning, I greatly encouraged Wende to get up
and go to church.  She did and now just called me to thank me for
getting her up.  It&rsquo;s 12:12 now and we&rsquo;re about to munch lunch.</p>

<p class=note>(transcribed from my diary)</p>

<p>Tonight Wende and I got our Water Altar diagram faxed to Richard and
then napped beautifully for 1.5 hours and then watched Simpson&rsquo;s and
Futurama for 1 hour and then ate Taco Bell and then had a spectacular
conversation.</p>

<p>Dumped out buckets worth of honesty and talk about sex and what it will
take for us (her) to trust each other (me).  Her need for me to say
clearly &ldquo;I will not have sex with _<strong><em>(girl-fixation of the week)</em></strong>_
while I&rsquo;m dating Wende&rdquo;  My need to sometimes say, &ldquo;I want to have sex
with ______&rdquo;  (but not do it; just know I &lsquo;want&rsquo; to.  Similar to me
saying I have a crush on Kat (&amp; Jen &amp; Keirsten &amp; Nancy &amp; Sara &amp; Sarah &amp;
Laura).</p>

<p>About how foreplay ish type stuff doesn&rsquo;t <em>have</em> to lead to
intercourse.</p>

<p>And releasing old pains:  Wende felt <em>really</em> bad when I spent
the night with Diane so long ago.</p>

<p>Wende left without us having sex tonight.  The conversation gave me the
strength to simply put myself to bed to sleep.  Thank you dear friend
Wende.</p>
