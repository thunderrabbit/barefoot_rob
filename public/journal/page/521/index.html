<p>When Wende and I first moved in, I applied silicon sealant along
the corners of our shower.  They have pretty well protected it for
over a year, but as the tile has settled, in some places the gap has
grown larger than what the silicon can cover.  So I ripped out most of
the old silicon today and will re-apply new tomorrow.  Gotta get some
masking tape to mask the area.</p>

<p>Good feeling to get this project done.</p>

<p>Our local YRUU hosted an intergenerational worship tonight, which
was well attended and well loved by the adults.  This is the first one
of a monthly series of worships they intend to do each second Sunday
of the month, I think.</p>

<p>The theme centered on the flaming chalice, describing how it came
to be the symbol of UUism.  Then people were invited to speak a few
words a light a candle or two on what the chalice means to them.</p>

<p>By the end of that part of the ceremony, all the candles were
arranged in a shape of a flaming chalice.  Nice.  Someone took
pictures; everyone expressed how wonderful they found the worship.</p>

<p>Great job, YRUU!</p>

<p>##5:32pm CDT Saturday 22 September 2001</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m cryin crying crying this whole week just feels fucking
pointless wllike what the fuck and I doing and this is all
menaingliess and aI just don&rsquo;t fucking know what tod  do.  Tears
aren&rsquo;t eavevne coming out t I&rsquo;m just crying and no tears . so stupid
why why is this so difficult?</p>

<p>I just want to feel valuable in this world.  I just want peole to like
me in this world.  Why amd I so scared of marrying wende?  she loves
me she thinks I&rsquo;m valuable this must be a totally different issue.</p>

<p>Is that right/  marrying wende is a diffiernt issue than if I feel
valuable or not?</p>

<p>maybe.</p>

<h2 id="5-34">5:34</h2>

<p>Every one is all tellin gme that the world doesnt work the way I want
it to work that everyithing isn&rsquo;t a cake ride and all fun adnd fucking
games, and fucking-games, but I think the worlsd can be a better
easier place, but then what would be the point?</p>

<p>do I really think that I should have it all figured out by now?</p>

<p>No, I just want to fell loved in the world and just want to have
experiences in the world</p>

<p>isn&rsquo;t this an experience that your&rsquo;e having right now/  maybe ist&rsquo;s
the case that you simply b could be present where you are in the world
and realize that your&rsquo;evae having all kinds of experieinces all the
time.  maybe.</p>

<p>##5:36</p>

<p>damm you&rsquo;re a fast typer.</p>

<p>go eat something healthy.  an apple maybe.</p>

<p>##6:01pm</p>

<p>I ate; it was good; I feel better.  Cleaned up some shit around the
kitchen</p>

<p>Oh, while I was talking to Meredith, or while she was talking to me
trying to give me advice, but just talking about her own marriage, I
cleaned a lot of shit off my desk in the study.  looks good.  almost
perfectly clean.</p>

<p>Going to KTRU soon; might stop by work first, if not, I&rsquo;ll stop by
work afterward.  Gotta put some shit online.  small fixes.</p>

<p>Ultimate was cancelled today due to rain, but I
didn't know that until I showed up at the fields. 
Doublechecked the time, just as a guy showed up and
asked from his truck window, "ultimate?"</p>

<p>A few more people started showing up until we had
about 18 and we played a continuous pickup game for a
couple hours.  My shorts got crazy muddy on the left
side as I slid on my butt for a great catch that I
think was not thrown to me, but I recovered it after
our other player barely missed it.</p>

<p>My shirt is pretty splattered, but nothing like
Bill who did a chest slide trying to catch one of my
throws for a point.  He didn't catch it, but he got
the cheer for effort.</p>

<p>I was ready to quit when someone suggesting playing
a game to 7 points.  We got to 6 - 6 and I called hard
cap; next point wins.  About 5 of their points had
been Mark to Mark connections - Mark Whorley and Mark
Leonard.  Quite impressive.</p>

<p>The next point was a short one.  Someone (Mark?)
hucked it to Mark Leonard, who I was covering.  It
floated down and he just had the moves and blocked me
out.  Just as we came down from the jump, two guys
zipped by us, bonking me a bit.  Nothing bad, but I
was just done; ready to go home.  They got the
point.</p>

<p>Walked across the street to the soccer fields to
find the restrooms locked.  The community center was
open, and full of a volleyball game - looked like
junior high girls and parents.  I came in all muddy
and changed clothes.  Came out clean a few minutes
later.</p>

<p>On the way home, so thankful that my side of the
freeway was moving briskly; the southbounds lanes of
59 were stopped, packed all the way back to
Westpark.</p>

<p>Excellent job, whoever wrote this.</p>

<pre>
Every U down in Uville liked U.S. a lot, 
But the Binch, who lived Far East of Uville, did not.

The Binch hated U.S! the whole U.S. way! 
Now don't ask me why, for nobody can say, 
It could be his turban was screwed on too tight. 
Or the sun from the desert had beaten too bright 
But I think that the most likely reason of all 
May have been that his heart was two sizes too small.

But, Whatever the reason, his heart or his turban, 
He stood facing Uville, the part that was urban. 
"They're doing their business," he snarled from his perch. 
"They're raising their families! They're going to church! 
They're leading the world, and their empire is thriving, 
I MUST keep the S's and U's from surviving!" 
Tomorrow, he knew, all the U's and the S's, 
Would put on their pants and their shirts and their dresses, 
They'd go to their offices, playgrounds and schools, 
And abide by their U and S values and rules, 
And then they'd do something he liked least of all, 
Every U down in U-ville, the tall and the small, 
Would stand all united, each U and each S, 
And they'd sing Uville's anthem, "God bless us! God bless!" 
All around their Twin Towers of Uville, they'd stand,
and their voices would drown every sound in the land.

"I must stop that singing," Binch said with a smirk, 
And he had an idea--an idea that might work! 
The Binch stole some U airplanes in U morning hours, 
And crashed them right into the Uville Twin Towers. 
"They'll wake to disaster!" he snickered, so sour, 
"And how can they sing when they can't find a tower?"
The Binch cocked his ear as they woke from their
sleeping,  All set to enjoy their U-wailing and weeping, 
Instead he heard something that started quite low, 
And it built up quite slow, but it started to grow-- 
And the Binch heard the most unpredictable thing... 
And he couldn't believe it--they started to sing! 
He stared down at U-ville, not trusting his eyes, 
What he saw was a shocking, disgusting surprise! 
Every U down in U-ville, the tall and the small, 
Was singing! Without any towers at all! 
He HADN'T stopped U-Ville from singing! It sung! 
For down deep in the hearts of the old and the young,

Those Twin Towers were standing, called Hope and called Pride, 
And you can't smash the towers we hold deep inside. 
So we circle the sites where our heroes did fall, 
With a hand in each hand of the tall and the small, 
And we mourn for our losses while knowing we'll cope,

For we still have inside that U-Pride and U-Hope. 
For America means a bit more than tall towers, 
It means more than wealth or political powers, 
It's more than our enemies ever could guess, 
So may God bless America! Bless us! God bless!

<p>A bizarre low number of phone calls arrived at the radio station
today; maybe the phone rang 6 times, and twice was the same guy
calling back because he thought of a different song I might play.</p>

<p>My only guess as to the low numbers of calls is that there was a
huge number of concerts and shows tonight.  I'm not sure if that was
random or what, but there were two big overnight concerts, each
featuring like 20 band/artists.  Amazing.</p>

<p>I even tried to give away free passes to Joelstein (or something)
to the first five people who came up to the station.  Nothing.  No
calls about it, nothing.</p>

<p>A guy whose name was on his tickets didn't even come to get them.</p>

<p>My theme for the night was to play the track number that matched
the song number of the night.  The first song I played was track 1 on
a CD.  Second song was track 2 on a different CD, etc etc until I was
scrambling for songs around 23 - 27, and I finally got as far as 29
before I had to give up.  It just kept getting increasingly more
difficult to find a CD with more than 25 songs on it.</p>

<p>I thought I was going to get to shut off the radio station, as
there is no DJ listed in the timeslot after me, but Alex and Wendy
showed up at 10 till 10.  Wow.</p>

<p>I'm glad to have a break this weekend.</p>

<p>Today work has been slow on email, but still some
stuff to do that I've been working on.  But not a lot
because our client-contact, let's call her Pattie, has
been giving us ridiculous specs for the project.</p>

<p>Not stuff that would be difficult to do, but stuff
that would be tragically unsafe for the data.</p>

<p>Basically she wants to allow the front page to show
a list of 50,000 email addresses and let people choose
their identity.  She is assuming no one will make
errors, and no one will be malicious.  But this is a
site that is to be available to the world!</p>

<p>My best guess as to the source of the insanity is
that she is used to working on an intranet, not the
Internet, and maybe even she is assuming the identity
of someone would be already identified.</p>

<p>Patrick is trying to get information to/from Pattie
to get this solved; I'm just writing the code as best
I can to be prepared for what I am hypothesizing will
be the specs.</p>

<p>Dude and I might take some more humanclock pics
tonight.</p>

<p>Did I tell you that my pics are on humanclock.com
from 11:50am to 11:52am?  If the pics is not me, click
reload until it is me.  Some in our house, some on
unicycle.  Four total - 2 on 11:52am.</p>

<p>My dad came over today and we went to Whole Foods
to get food and then stopped by KFC for dinner.  Ate
dinner and Wende brought me a fountain with spinning
ball that is so great.  I set it up, finished eating,
then got to work with crying.</p>

<p>Couldn't cry full blown on the couch, so we went
upstairs and into Wende's closet where I cried into
pillows and mostly cried when I started thinking about
3rd grade meanness from Corey Fisher, and that Kristen
my dog died and Jedi died.  Surprising thing is that I
have blamed myself for Jedi's death.  Cried cried
cried  about that.</p>

<p>But the best part about that is that I hadn't
really recognized this shame / guilt I was feeling, so
that means since I've uncovered it, I can uncover
more; more shame/guilt might be hiding, and I am
thankful to find it and release it.</p>

<p>Higher Self said that at this point I should choose
myself over both Wende and Sally.</p>

<p>Talked to Katharine and hopefully will be able to
help her with her stuff.</p>

I've been hearing a lot of talk about "bombing
Afghanistan back to the Stone Age."  Ron Owens, on KGO
Talk Radio today, allowed  that this would mean
killing innocent people, people who had nothing to do
with this atrocity, but "we're at war, we have to
accept collateral damage.  What else can we do?" 
Minutes later I heard some TV pundit discussing
whether we "have the belly to do what must be done." 
And I thought about the issues being raised especially
hard because I am from Afghanistan, and even though
I've lived here for 35 years  I've never lost track of
what's going on there.  So I want to tell anyone who
will listen how it all looks from where I'm standing.

I speak as one who deeply hates the Taliban and Osama
Bin Laden.  My hatred comes from first hand
experience.  There is no doubt in my mind that these
people were responsible for the atrocity in New York. 
I agree that something must be done about those
monsters.

But the Taliban and Ben Laden are not Afghanistan. 
They're not even the government of Afghanistan.  The
Taliban are a cult of ignorant psychotics who took
over Afghanistan in 1997.  Bin Laden is a political
criminal with a plan.  When you think Taliban, think
Nazis.  When you think Bin Laden, think Hitler.  And
when you think "the people of Afghanistan" think "the
Jews in the concentration camps."

It's not only that the Afghan people had nothing to do
with this atrocity.  They were the first victims of
the perpetrators.  They would exult if someone would
come in there, take out the Taliban and clear out the
rats nest of international thugs holed up in their
country.  Some say, why don't the Afghans rise up and
overthrow the Taliban?  The answer is, they're
starved, exhausted, hurt, incapacitated, suffering.  A
few years ago, the United Nations estimated that there
are 500,000 disabled orphans in Afghanistan - a
country with no economy, no food.  There are millions
of widows.  And the Taliban has been burying these
widows alive in mass graves.  The soil is littered
with land mines, the farms were all destroyed by the
Soviets.  These are a few of the reasons why the
Afghan people have not overthrown the Taliban.

We come now to the question of "bombing Afghanistan
back to the Stone Age".  Trouble is, that's been done.
 The Soviets took care of it already.  Make the
Afghans suffer?  They're already suffering.  Level
their houses?  Done.  Turn their schools into piles of
rubble?  Done.  Eradicate their hospitals?  Done. 
Destroy their infrastructure?  Cut them off from
medicine and health care?  Too late.  Someone already
did all that.  New bombs would only stir the rubble of
earlier bombs.  Would they at least get the Taliban? 
Not likely.  In today's Afghanistan, only the Taliban
eat, only they have the means to move around.  They'd
slip away and hide.

Maybe the bombs would get some of those disabled
orphans, they don't move too fast, they don't even
have wheelchairs.  But flying over Kabul and dropping
bombs would not really be a strike against the
criminals who did this horrific thing.  Actually it
would only be making common cause with the Taliban -
by raping once again the people they've been raping
all this time.

So what else is there?  What can be done, then?  Let
me now speak with true fear and trembling.  The only
way to get Bin Laden is to go in there with ground
troops.  When people speak of "having the belly to do
what needs to be done" they're thinking in terms of
having the belly to kill as many as needed.  Having
the belly to overcome any moral qualms about killing
innocent people.  Let's pull our heads out of the
sand.  What's actually on the table is Americans
dying.  And not just because some Americans would die
fighting their way through Afghanistan to Bin Laden's
hideout.

It's much bigger than that folks.  Because to get any
troops to Afghanistan, we'd have to go through
Pakistan.  Would they let us?  Not likely.  The
conquest of Pakistan would have to be first.  Will
other Muslim nations just stand by?  You see where I'm
going.  We're flirting with a world war between Islam
and the West.

And guess what: that's Bin Laden's program.  That's
exactly what he wants.  That's why he did this.  Read
his speeches and statements. It's all right there.  He
really believes Islam would beat the west.  It might
seem ridiculous, but he figures if he can polarize the
world into Islam and the West, he's got a billion
soldiers.  If the west wreaks a holocaust in those
lands, that's a billion people with nothing left to
lose, that's even better from Bin Laden's point of
view.  He's probably wrong, in the end the West would
win, whatever that would mean, but the war would last
for years and millions would die, not just theirs but
ours.  Who has the belly for that?  Unfortunately, Bin
Laden does.  Anyone else?

                In Peace,

                Tamim Ansary

<p>I have a fear that we're going to start shooting a
bunch of missles at a bunch of islams, and then 'a
terrorist' will release some anthrax or some other
biological germ agent in a couple of big cities in the
US.</p>

<p>That would suck.</p>

<p>There is a vaccine for anthrax, but according to
some websites, it's only 20% effective if given in
large doses once symptoms appear.  According to other
websites, the only company that makes the vaccine was
sanctioned for non-quality work.</p>
