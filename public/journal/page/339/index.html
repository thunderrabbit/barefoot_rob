<p>The point of the previous story is that now my energy level is not
such that I want to write about Fujikyu Highland, even though it was
pretty pimp overall.  I will say that we rode King of Coasters 3
times, and I liked it better each time I rode it.  About 7 total
seconds of air time while riding in the back car, and just fucking
awesome manuevers.</p>

<p>The ride called Do Do Pa sucks.  I'll admit that it's fast, but it
does only one interesting manuever.  It's *NOT* worth a 2 hour wait in
line.  Maybe 15 minutes.  If the line extends outside the building,
skip it and go ride Mad Mouse, which is a much more taxing roller
coaster.</p>

<p>On the way home from work I saw Olivia and her friend Olivia.  They
had just been to Fujiku Highland today!!!  They said that unless we
get there before noon, not to buy the day passes, and just get
individual tickets for rides.  They said the park rules.</p>

<p>Awesome.</p>

<p>Nice.  I got my .emacs file to work for creating journal entry
names for 1 or 2 digit dates.  Used to be I had to tweak it every 1st
and 10th of the month.</p>

<p>Slept later than I planned, but I'm on the bus no problem.  Had a
dream where</p>

<p class=dream>Steve and I were writing on a dry erase board, like
alternately writing and erasing without needing to ask what was
appropriate; we knew when it was okay to erase the others' work, or
add to it or whatever.  I wrote an I miss you YRUU kittens message,
and then it was a T-shirt we were giving to Fred for continuing the
Nugen legacy in YRUU.  After that we couldn't erase it anymore, so I
realized it was a dream and then realized I shouldn't be sleeping
because I had to be at work.  Eeek!</p>

<p>So I woke up and it was about 8:30.  Perfect timing.  Thank you
Angels.</p>

<p>So <em>fucking</em> excited to be done with work!  My day was even
better than yesterday cause, though I didn't mention it, my last
lesson yesterday was swapped at the last minute from a man to man to a
3-student level 5 lesson.  I'm not authorized to teach the type of
lesson the original man to man required.  The 5's were fine though; no
problems.</p>

<p>So today I finished out with man to mans and voice, though one of
my man to mans had a student added, but whatever; I got over it and
then I finished out the day with Tomoko, the awesome god-fearing
Christian student who I leveled up last week with J-lo I think.
Anyway, this was her first level 7A lesson and she blew through it
like nothin'.  Didn't even touch the reading; she picture-speculated
the entirety of the reading.  (basically) used more impressive words
than were given by the reading.  She'll LU again soon.</p>

<p>But the main reason I'm excited to be done?  It's T3 time with
Nami!</p>

<p>Everyone meets at Hachiko.   That's where I am now, watching
everyone meet everyone else with varying degrees of excitement, but
almost never with hugs.  haven't seen any hugs tonight.</p>

<p>Oh, one cat on the train talked to me today.  I was like, "arru?"
but then I switched from Japanese-attempt-mode to English no problem
desu mode, chatted with him a bit.  He's Japanese and will be moving
to Texas to learn how to fly at Gulfport Airport??  I dunno where the
heck that is, but he said it was small.</p>

<p>In addition to everyone meeting everyone else at Hachiko, everyone
smokes while meeting people.  <em>I'm</em> practically smoking with
all the second hand smoke; thank god there is a breeze going on.</p>

<p>I still don't understand the fashion of the Shibuya Girls.  I
wonder how acceptable is that term.  They look fake beyond fake, like
dark dark skin, blonde (orange to white hair), long black eyelashes
and really thin..  I'm like, "yikes' stripes!  get some food and cut
that hair!"</p>

<p>And quit smoking!  But they don't.</p>

<p>OH!!  There is a display near the station celebrating the 25th
anniversary of Space Invaders, one of the first video games to rock
the casbah (where did that come from?) about, um, 25 years ago I
imagine.  There were some peeps playing it on about four different
stations and a man with a pretty expensive looking video camera
filming them, with close ups of the game and of the players
playing.</p>

<p>Several people are wearing yukatas today; this is the summer
festival season, with fireworks going on nearly every night somewhere
in the greater Tokyo area.  I haven't seen any such fireworks
displays, but I'll probably go on 23 August with Carla and Mika (and
others?)</p>

<p>umm... hmmm.. I think that's all.</p>

<p>Fun with Nami tonight.   She helps me find that place of courage in
me, plus gives me immediate feedback on my Japanese speaking.  She
said that for months (years?) she didn't speak English in America.
She said she's impressed with my effort to speak Japanese so early in
my Japanese-living career.  Big thank yous to everyone who has said
the same thing.  I told her that I am scared each time I speak, but
that I work hard to overcome.  Sometimes I drive myself too hard.  I
<em>always</em> want to be <em>the best</em> at everything I do.  {(In
ultimate I was the best cause I was barefoot.  In life I'm the best
cause I don't drink.  I code my HTML by hand.  In Japan I'm the best
cause I persevere.  I work hard to learn Japanese.  I want to know all
my students' names.  Just like in YRUU; I was the best cause I learned
all the youths' names. )}  As all these thoughts flew through my head
in a trice, I felt sadness bubble into my being from somewhere;
somehow, from somewhere, sadness.</p>

<p>I acknowledged the emotion, turned it around, sent it back home
until another day.</p>

<p>Nami seemed to understand that I want to be the best.  I don't know
if she wants herself to be the best, but maybe she does.</p>

<p>Nami and I are going to Fujiku Highland on Tuesday.  At least that
is the plan unless she has to work too late tomorrow night, in which
case we'll go to Yumiuriland, and I'll go to Fujiku Highland myself
someday.  I'll go.  I persevere.  (Interesting that I haven't tried to
go to Fujisan.)</p>

<p>I told her the first night we met that honesty is quite important
to me.  I like truth.  Tonight I told her that our friendship is more
important that Fujiku Highland.  So please get some sleep instead of
getting home late from work and getting up early for FkH.</p>

<p>Gotta get some batteries for my camera tomorrow.  I wonder if I'll
remember to do it before work.  I wonder when I'll get another train
teiki.</p>

<p>Interesting to note the different ways I try to save money.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>So in conclusion, I had great fun with Nami tonight.</p>

<p>I slept after work, and have just spent 2 hours (!) ???  writing 2
emails and being WAY sidetracked on this thing called Dashboard that
looks pretty cool, but is hardly ready for consumer consumption.</p>

<p>Sally is interested in the source of my journal, and I'm tempted to
run through and pull together a "releaseable" version ("releaseable" =
"here's some shit that works for me, good luck!"), but that would be
another tangent, I fear.  Do I have more pressing issues?</p>

<p>Mmmmmmm...   my room is a disaster area.  argh.</p>

<p>Get up get up; check the status of important things in my life.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Ah.  Need to see about getting shit reserved for when janette comes
and confirm meeting with Yukiji.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Emailed yukiji.  I need to stop waiting for Yasuko to respond with
train schedule information.  Fuck!</p>

<p>My server is responding too slowly for me to navigate around and
fuck with source code, so I'm not going to do that now.</p>

<p>Back to sleeep.</p>

<p>I would just stay up today and sleep crazy long tonight after work,
but I'm going to see T3 with Nami tonight after work!</p>

<p><p><b>Comment:</b>
<br>this is how bad i am:  reading that getting shit reserved for when janette comes, is more important right now than finding the source of your journal(what does That mean,anyway?)for sally,(this is sally in cali,no?) makes me happy in an ego-aries way.  after playing second fiddle(Not an ego-aries way) to sally for so long &hellip;.<br>
  feels nice in a selfish-yay for me way.<br>

<p>Hmm.  Today was lovely cause I had a busy schedule at first, but
then got to close out the day with a light schedule: kids, then man to
man, then voice, then man to man.</p>

<p><img src="/images/travel/japan2003-2004/peeps/hikari.jpg" align=left> Kids
lesson was awesome; ‚Ð‚©‚è is 8 and really good.  I went through the ASL
alphabet with her and she told me how to sign thank you in Japanese (I
think).  So I taught her how to say "thank you," and how to say "I'm 8
years old" in ASL.</p>

<p>She took off my glasses and I took a picture (with my phone of
course) of her.  Oh, and she drew me a picture.  Oh, and when she
couldn't remember how to ask "how old are you?" I mouthed the words
and she got it.  Nice.</p>

<p>Woke up.  Worked on redoing my navigation.  Internet connectivity
slowed.  Took a nap.  janette called to say HI.  HI!  She's calling
Maggie now.  I'm glad they're connecting.</p>

<p class=date>10:41am</p>

<p>After some hours of work spread over a couple weeks or more, I have
released the new navigation system on my site.  I like it.</p>

<br>also, one of the coolest things was how  your site changed as i read it!  it appeared one way, then blinked and came on as another.<br>
