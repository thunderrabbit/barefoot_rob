of Janet and Mockingbird.  Close.</p>

<p>All of the workstations have the ethernet jack, but only one is

<p>After chatting with Colleen for 1.5 hours on AIM, which was great
because at first she was feeling blue, and by the end she was feeling
joyful, and funny because we were sitting basically next to one
another in Bibby Kitchen, and were breaking new artistic ground with
combining technology and real life, we played Apples to Apples with
Josephine, Meg, me, Skyler, Heather, Paul, Colleen, Hillary all
playing.  Good stuff.  It was the first time I had played.</p>

<p>During the game, Josephine said something really funny that I was
going to write down if I remembered it.</p>

<p>Colleen and I tied; we kept being either the top two winners or
bottom two losers in almost every round.</p>

<p>After the game, after some hours of discussion that had already
happened, I paid Colleen $5 to take a bite of an onion.  It was less
gross than expected.  Then I took a bite of it and got my five dollars
back.  Plus I got a free stick of gum out of the deal.</p>

<p>Chatted with Katy B-H, and now it's bed time.  But I don't know
where I'm going to sleep.  Gotta scope out a space.</p>

<p>Good night!</p>

<p>At a rest area now about 135 miles from Fort Worth on 287.  I just
called Josephine and Janette and chatted with them a bit; Josephine
told me a funny Skyler story and said she's heard of a new joke, the
Pink Car joke, which is a new one for us; Janette and I are going to
try and see Eight Mile again, and Two Towers together.</p>

<p>Got disconnected, though I could hear her wishing me well, then I
turned on "Rabbit Run" and ripped through it pretty effectively.
Rock.</p>

<p class=date>6:07pm</p>

<p>Woo.  For some parts of "Rabbit Run" I can articlate the words
faster than he does in the album version.</p>

<p>iTunes music now.  About 104 miles from Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Zooomin.</p>

<p class=date>8:21pm</p>

<p>Home.  6499.8 miles traveled.  155000 (exactly) miles on Scott.</p>

<p>House looks beautiful with green christmas lights on the bushes,
matching the green lights inside on the tree, and the green porch
light that's always been there..</p>

<p>I've paid my $20 to see the Grand Canyon.  Sun is not yet over the
horizon, but it's definitely dawn-ish.</p>

<p>I've parked at a little turnout on the south rim road I think.</p>

<p>BRRRRRR!!</p>

<p class=date>7:06am</p>

<p>Wow.  The earth certainly is big compared to me.</p>

<p>I can tell because a point on the earth's equator rotates over 1000
miles per hour with respect to the sun, yet it took fucking forever
for the earth to rotate enough for the sun's photons to directly hit
the lower portion of the canyon walls.</p>

<p>I did a little dance to keep warm for that hour (<em>almost</em>
made it an hour!), humming a medley containing snippets from "Santa
Claus is coming to town" the Navy march song (that Sam Malone
sometimes plays to close his morning show around 9:40am weekdays on
104.1 KRBE in Houston), Ants And Cheese, The Addams Family, and
something else but I can't remember.</p>

<p>Watching the sun rise over the Grand Canyon was pretty cool.  Like
a small light had been flipped on when I first noted a tiny bit of
rock shown more brightly than its comrades.  Like a great idea, the
brightness crept down the striations, always saturating along a
careful horizontal line, like a painting unveiled from the top.</p>

<p class=date>7:37am</p>

<p>Okay.  My plan is to continue along 64 on the south side of the
canyon and then take 89 south to Flagstaff, to my next planned Kinko's
location.  There are patches of ice on 64 here, even in the
well-touristed area right beside the canyon, so I'm wondering how much
ice I'll encounter on 89, which is some ways away from the canyon.</p>

<p>5363 miles since Dallas.</p>

<p>Surrounded by juniper and leafless oaks, none more than 30 feet
tall.  Snow covers the ground - about 6 inches average.  Road is rough
asphalt, undivided, 1 lane each direction, spotted with occasional icy
spots.</p>

<p class=date>8:34am</p>

<p>Just visited the Tusayan Museum and Ruins.  The museum is small,
holds some artifacts left behind by some old school cats.  The ruins
are estimated 800 years old, as discerned by noting the pattern of
ring growth in the juniper.</p>

<p>5383.8 miles traveled.</p>

<p class=date>8:38am</p>

<p>Stopped at another outlook .25 miles away.  There's a recycling bin
here, so I grabbed my plastic bottles to recycle.  The gallon water
jug is like a balloon!  Totally inflated as it was sealed at sea
level, and now it's at 7000 feet.  Wow!</p>

<p>Oh, by the way, I'm at the Grand Canyon, but this inflated carton
is really neat!</p>

<p class=date>9:30am</p>

<p>Wow!!  I just met Moritza, who appeared to be traveling alone, so I
asked her, "are you traveling alone?"  "Yes."  "Cool; me too."  "Where
are you from?"  "Houston."  "Really?"</p>

<p>She's a CPA and loves to travel; has been to Italy, Egypt, Japan,
and probably some other places as well.</p>

<p>She inspired me that i'm on the right track; travel travel travel.
Meet people.  Get into adventures.</p>

<p>I definitely gave her my adventure card.</p>

<p>5385.9 miles traveled.</p>
<p>We met while poring over the Hance Rapids sign at Lipan point off
64 on the south side of GC</p>

<p>Free access and it's great.</p>

<p>Oh, hey, I'm switching my timezone to CST, considering I've been in
MST for a while and still using PST; this will slightly balance it
out, by skipping MST altogether.</p>

<p>Dammm.  I just looked over the "Rabbit Run" lyrics.. that's a lot!
I continue to be impressed with Eminem's skillz.</p>

<p>Aight.  I'm as done online as I'm going to be tonight.  There is a
rest area one hour away from here; I hope it's open; a couple rest
areas in NM along I-40 have been closed.</p>

<p>In any case, I'm going to drive east more until I get to the rest
area or some other spot that looks good for sleeping.</p>

<p>Ah; I found my next Kinko's in Amarillo.  It's near a street called
Mockingbird.  Close!  But wrong city.</p>

<p>I'm driving across a huge leopard of snow and little spots of grass
growing up through it.  Completely overcast now; I don't know if it's
my lower elevation, or maybe I'm on a different side of a mountain
now; really that's the same thing.</p>

<p>Passed lots of Navaho Jewelry markets, little flea market lookin'
places with old painted signs and weathered plywood structures to vend
their wares.</p>

<p>I didn't stop.</p>

<p>I'm settled in for the drive to Flagstaff, where I'll stop at
Kinko's and upload all this stuff.</p>

<p class=date>10:56am</p>

<p>Crested a pass at 7276 feet, and then turned off the highway to a
road that climbed up into the forest and to the top of this mountain,
where I passed a small sign saying "hard hat area" blah blah but I
pretended not to see it and then passed some family with sleds playing
around in the snow.</p>

<p>Now I'm parked in this gravel quary with big scoopers and conveyer
belts and piles of gravel, all sprinkled or covered in snow.  No other
people seem to be here.</p>

<p>I'm going to go walk around.</p>

<p class=date>11:45am</p>

<p>Wow.  That was more or less fun.  There were other people there; a
girl sledding down a small portion of the snow covered gravel, and a
trailer with a minivan parked in front of it.</p>

<p>I walked around anyway, and <em>forgot my camera!!!</em> so I
couldn't take a digital picture of the sharp contrast between virgin
snow and brilliant blue sky.</p>

<p>While I tried to call Bibby's, a guy came up the hill from the
other direction.  "This is private property" and all that.</p>

<p>I apologized profusely and thanked him for looking after me.</p>

<p>They were mining pumice he said, but now they are piling the dirt
back into the mine because they're done, I guess.</p>

<p>I drove out, found the gate locked, presumed I had gone to the
wrong gate, but hadn't checked it.  Even if it wasn't locked, it might
be that I'm going <em>further</em> into private property, so I turned
around, followed the left hand edge of the road and ended up back at
the minivan and trailer.  That had to be the gate.  Went back, opened
it, closed it, wondered why Sam hadn't told me he had closed it, then
realized that the other family must have closed it on their way out,
for they were no longer at the hill.</p>

<p>So that means Sam thinks that *I* specifically opened the gate and
then claimed to not know it was private property.  Ahh well.</p>
