<p>It's light outside.  Light-ish.  A BORDER PATROL truck
<em>just</em> drove by as I wrote "Light-ish."  Across the street from
me I see Acco Feeds company with a Purina checkboard logo on it,
stacks of hay, and a small grain silo thing.  I see a yucca plant,
several leafless trees, some yellow/brown leafed trees, and some old
one story houses with extra rooms added on over the years.  No caved
in rooftops except for two metal sheds.</p>

<p>I'm going to search for breakfast so that I can charge my battery
and get something warm inside me.</p>

<p class=date>8:37am</p>

<p>I got an apple (found one that did *not* have frost on it) at the
grocery store, which reminded me of a small Fiesta store.  All the
normal stuff and normal muzak (Madonna and something else) and Jesus
candles and friendly people in the store.  Even regular walking around
people seem friendly here.</p>

<p>There are a ton of churches in Marfa.  The Republican Headquarters
of Presidio County has a church on each side of it.</p>

<p class=date>9:09am</p>

<p>I just had a sausage burrito for $2 including tax from Country
Time?  Town Country?  TC or CT.  Anyway it was yummy and for that I'm
thankful.</p>

<p>I'm in Marfa Public Library now and my computer is plugged in,
though not internet connected.  The computers here are in plain view
of the front desk, so I won't likely fuck around with them too much to
see if I can get my computer internetified.</p>

<p>Oh, I saw a Historical Marker suggesting that this is the oldest
town in America (10,000 years old) and is the site of the first wagon
train from Mexico into Texas (1540 something).  I don't think Texas is
quite that old, but hey.</p>

<p>Today I plan to see McDonald Observatory, Balmorhea, Carlsbad
Caverns, not necessarily in that order.</p>

<p>I'm leaving Marfa (Public Library) now.</p>

<p class=date>10:49am</p>

<p>Driving on a straight mostly flat two lane highway 17 going
presumably due north.  Flat flat flat grassy speckled with cacti
around me and not mountain ranges around, but lumps of mountains
scattered about.  Just passed Marfa municipal airport.</p>

<p class=date>11:09am</p>

<p>Have gone through Fort Davis and now am within some hilly terrain
and some trees, including this beautiful yellow tree.  Wow.</p>

<p>If it wasn't so flipping cold, I might climb this hill thing.</p>

<p class=date>11:14am</p>

<p>"Alright, that does it," I announced outloud when I turned another
corner, saw a cool rock formation and a <em>picnic table</em> and
small parking area beside it!!!</p>

<p class=date>11:38am</p>

<p>Fun fun fun climbing.  Rocks were so easily climbable.  I carried
out 6 cans/bottles from the area.  I'm thankful it is cold because I
was able to climb more easily and with fewer injuries wearing shoes
and long pants and long sleevie hoodie and gloves.</p>

<p>I doubt it will be easily visible, but I just took a picture of
McDonald Observatory as i just crested a hill to discover it on a
small mountain.  586.3 miles traveled so far.</p>

<p class=date>12:14pm</p>

<p>I've now purchased a postcard for my dad at the visitors center.
I'm going to walk 1 mile horizontally and 500 feet vertically to the
big open to public telescope.  Most people drive, but the girl at the
gift shop said I can walk it "if you want to..."</p>

<p>"I'll see how I feel when I get outside and see it."</p>

<p>I see it, and I feel fine.</p>

<p class=date>1:04pm</p>

<p>I drove.  I encountered a fence with equipment behind it and chose
not to walk through that area.</p>

<p>Drove up to the observatory and enjoyed seeing ice affixed to and
dripping from trees.  Climbed the steps to see the telescope and it
was as big and boring as I guessed it would be.  But I did learn a few
things like when the first space shuttle launched (April 1981) and
that this observatory did the first laser lunar-distance measurements
back in the day, and that the pleiades are 410 light years distant.</p>

<p>Oh, and that they have nightly star parties at the 107 inch
telescope after dark throughout the year.</p>

<p>Going now to Balmorhea.</p>

<p class=date>1:09pm</p>

<p>Heehee; as the wind blew through the frozen leaves, a virtual
snowstorm spattered onto the parking lot.  I stood in it for a while.
Fun!</p>

<p>Not slowly, not quickly.  Just steadily meditatively preparing,
collecting my stuff, cleaning the kitchen, adding Josephine's goodbye
note to my scrapbook.</p>

<p>I plan to visit Balmorhea State Park first, I think.  Down by El
Paso, but closer to Marfa.</p>

<p class=date>11:30am</p>

<p>Okay.  I've traveled zero miles so far on my western state trek.
Here we go!</p>

<p>I'm at another rest area - the one before Pecos.  Just chillin' for
a second and stretch before the next one which is 119 miles away.
That's the one I have my sights on tonight, but that seems a bit far
for me.  Maybe.</p>

<p>Oh wait.  no.  The one I have eyes on is a picnic area with no
facilities.  I can use a Toyah restroom when I wake up.  I've only got
like 50 miles to go before sleepin' a bit.</p>

<p>Skipped the picnic area idea when I found an exit indicating
Balmorhea is 37 miles away.  449 miles traveled so far.</p>

<p class=date>8:37pm</p>

<p>Have just arrived at Balmorhea.  Now I know how to spell it.  Sleep
now.</p>

<p>My computer screen is off to save battery power; fifty four minutes
left.  Um, oh my car feels quite warm right now, or warm enough to
sleep comfortably, but who knows if it will stay warm all night.  Not
me.</p>

<p>Okay, goodnight.</p>

<p class=date>9:11pm</p>

<p>Man fuck trying to sleep all crunched up in my car.  I've got my
sleeping bag on top of a picnic table now.  <em>much</em> better!!</p>

<p>Goodnight for real.</p>

<p>Have driven 88.2 miles so far.  I'm at a rest area just inside the
Palo Pinto county line.  Have seen some NO TOLERANCE signs regarding
speed limit enforcement.  Hadn't seen such in Texas before now, only
in Oklahoma.</p>

<p>Been listening to my new Eminem tape with 8 Mile and some of his
older shit on it.</p>

<p class=date>1:31pm</p>

<p>That was the restarea where I met the guy cleaning the sink who
hasn't lived outside of Texas, but has visited Texas City, Carlsbad
(he says the Caverns are deeper now and take all day to go down and
get back up), Oklahoma, and was born in Fort Stockton.  Lives now in
Stephenville.</p>

<p>It's 105 miles to Abilene from here.  540 some odd miles to El
Paso, so about that to Balmorhea; dunno if I'll make it that far
tonight or not.</p>

<p>Oh, and I climbed around on the concret benches a bit, didn't use
my hands to balance sidways along a wall while facing the roof/wall of
the shelter, turned and jumped to another platform.  Good little bit
of exercise before I begin again.</p>

<p class=date>2:01pm</p>

<p>Apparently plenty of space for a radio station out here 75 miles
east of Abilene.  I only found 1 station across the entire band of FM
and AM.  It was not a hip hop station.</p>

<p class=date>2:05pm</p>

<p>Oh, nevermind.  I didn't have my radio's antenna up.  Two FM
stations, neither of which is hip hop, and plenty of AM stations, one
of which broadcasts Dr Laura right now.</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>I have never previously heard Dr Laura.  I have read some rants
about her online, and have a sense that she stands for some things for
which I do not.</p>

<p>Now I've had confirmation, though she's not 100% wizack.  Just
mostly wack.</p>

<p class=date>2:29pm</p>

<p>Okay.  Nevermind.  She's totally fucking nutty.  Peer pressuring a
mom to get her daughter out of public school RIGHT NOW and create a
big stink about how all public schools are in cahoots with Planned
Parenthood, especially in California, to subversively take your kids
out of school against your will and without your knowledge to allow
them to do anything they want.  Harshing the mom cause she doesn't
have a cellphone and at least her new husband will teach her how to be
a good parent.</p>

<p>The mom had called complaining that the school had allowed her 13
year old to go to Planned Parenthood after the 13 year old had had sex
with someone that the mom presumes is a male.</p>

<p>Dr Laura all, "let's hope he's 4 years older than her so you can
throw him in jail.  Sue his family.  Sue the school.  Sue them and
make the biggest stink you can about this because that's the only way
that something is going to happen."</p>

<p>Dr Laura doesn't know if this woman has got the balls/means/courage
to do something effective after being pressured to get her daughter
out of school on an emotional whim.  Jeez.</p>

<p>No shit the school should allow the girl to go there.  *Obviously*
the mom doesn't know what the fuck is going on with the girl in the
first place.  (See I know, but Dr L doesn't, right?)  whatever.</p>

<p>Right now I'm driving on divided highway I-20, two lanes each
direction, mowed grass in the median, with overcast sky and a couple
long winged birds floating around over rolling seas of trees, maybe
oak or something else generally round with slightly off-green leaves
with some dark green patches on the hillsides and pear cacti visiting
the sides of the roadway in great herds and sometimes solitary
sentinels, keeping a watch for the others.</p>

<p>I'm in Abilene, or on I-20 north of Abilene's business I-20.  Just
stopped to P, get gas (for $1.399/gallon) and stretch.  It's about 40
degrees F outside.  And windy.  brrrr!  That makes me glad I'm not
doing this trek on my bike.</p>

<p>225.2 miles traveled.  I'm at a rest area just before Stink Creek
Road.  I've been drinking a lot of water.</p>
