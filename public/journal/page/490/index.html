<p class=note>dreams</p>

<p class=dream>Many many ceiling tiles were missing in my apartment,
and I helped fix them by drilling holes in some wooden frames so they
could be attached to the ceiling.</p>

<p class=dream>Someone pointed out that we could get some natural glue
products that would work better than screws to hold the frame in place
- carrots.  I'm not sure how that was supposed to work exactly,
though.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class=dream>With Bryn in London again, and she intended to take a
very high dollar high class tour to somewhere.  Jason Fricke was there
and tried to talk his way onto the tour.  'You got any second or third
class seats I can use?' and the ticket person was all, 'no, we have
nothing below first class.'</p>

<p class=dream>Bryn was all upset that someone was trying to take the
same tour as her without having done the same calibre of research she
had done for so long.</p>

<p class=dream>I hugged her.</p>

<p>Yesterday my team lost both games of Ultimate, but I really felt
great like I played my absolute best.  That felt fantastic, especially
after I had some concern with my legs being too sore after Numbers the
previous night.</p>

<p>After Ultimate, I slept then DJed at KTRU which was a bit strange
because the telephone wasn't working in the control room.  This didn't
pose too much of a problem because it was fully 1.5 hours into my
shift before I got a <em>single</em> phone call.  In the last 1.5
hours of my shift, I got 5 callers.</p>

<p>Went to bed again after KTRU and then woke up feeling relatively
refreshed at 3:30am.  So I went to the laundry room and did my four
loads of laundry that I've neglected for about a month.  I love having
tons of rally shirts!</p>

<p>During laundry from 3:30am to 5:00am, I learned for sure the
Japanese words for the days of the week.</p>

<p>As my clothes spun around in the dryer for the final 30 minutes, I
felt really tempted to go to sleep, but I knew it would be more of a
pain to not have my laundry done and upstairs.  So I did some yoga to
stay awake and somehow made it.</p>

<p>Hey, it's Cinco de Mayo.</p>

<p>Don't read this if you don't want any details on the Spider-Man
movie.</p>

<p>Maggie and I saw Spider-Man yesterday afternoon.  We were first in
line, but some people cheated and ignored the line.  As we entered the
theater, there were about 4 people in the theater, including a guy
right in the center where I like to sit, so I broke social mores and
sat right next to him, "Hi."</p>

<p>He goes, "so they finally let the line go, eh?" proving that he
<em>knew</em> he had cut.</p>

<p>"Yeah, everyone was calling you guys cheaters.  You should move over
one seat and give me the middle."  (As Maggie put it, I was offering
him a chance to do the right thing.)</p>

<p>He said, "no way."</p>

<p>I dropped it with him, but was well entertained by Maggie discussing
Proximity Experiments (that's not the exact term she used, but) where
people would specifically sit next to the 1 other person in an
otherwise empty movie theater to see how that person would react. 
(Often with violence if the second person to sit would get up and
follow the first person if s/he reseated themselves.)</p>

<p>I was all laughing, commenting that yeah, at least I didn't raise
the arm up between the seats and sit next to him all, "HIiii."</p>

<p>Oh, darn the arms don't come up between these seats anyway.</p>

<p>In good comic book fashion, the movie showed the creation of the two
super-humans: one good, and one bad, each of which had a normal human
life, and each knew each other in both realities, but didn't know it
until 3/4ths the way through.</p>

<p>Spider-man had the experience of
loss/revenge/bigger-loss-as-a-result-of-revenge which I thought was
interesting: he didn't get the promised $3000 for winning the fight, so
he left the office which was then immediately robbed, but given the
chance Peter didn't apprehend the robber, who then killed Peter's uncle
to steal his car.</p>

<p>That's the scene where Spider-Man really kicked it into high gear
for the first time, swooping swooshing through the artificial canyon of
city buildings, causing Maggie to be all, "whoah!  my stomach!"</p>

<p>I was so completely bummed at the end of the movie when he couldn't
tell the girl that he loved her even though he wanted nothing more.</p>

<p>I just got home from Maggie's where we watched the deleted scenes
from Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back on DVD.  Pretty funny, most of
them, but probably more funny if I knew more movie stuff than I do,
especially their movie stuff.  (obviously (?))</p>

<p>I re-felt the sense of, "wow, I wonder if I could write a movie and
be all famous and shit?" and when I think about it, I realize that's
not in my life path right now, but there's a part of me that
romanticizes the idea.</p>

<p>After Spider-Man, we met Eric and Meredith at Red Robin, at I-10 and
610.  Waiter's name was Supa Dupa Mike, who knocked off the price of
both teas after charging for two teas when there was only one.</p>

<p>I ordered Nachos Machos sin jalepeños, but it came with them anyway.
 He took them off at my reminder.</p>

<p>Drove by Eric and Meredith's house and Maggie reminded me we were
near her old old old old neighborhood from which I would pick her up
each day before school in 1992.  That's when we had a lot of classes
together.  How could I have forgotten about picking her up?  I had, but
remembered after she told me.</p>

<p>She dropped me off at her house (where I had left my car after YRUU)
and I zipped home.</p>

<p class=note>dream</p>

<p class=dream>with Tammy/Lee-eh and some one who might have been my
gay friend Kenneth from gymnastics outside in a Target parking lot, and
we were getting in to Tammy's car, but we were arbitrarily trying to
make it more difficult in the following way.  We all had to remain
in physical contact with one another, 9touching the hand of someone
else in the group, and had to get in on opposite sides of the car.</p>

<p class=dream>I got in first and Tammy got in after me (o the same
side) but had to crawl over me to get into the middle seat, and the
Kenneth had to climber over the to of the car to get in the other side
of the car, but he had to remain holding my hand the entire time.</p>

<p class=dream>Must have been plasticman, cause he was ale to do it
without regrabbing my or tammy's had through the sun roof or the other
side of the car, and when he got there the door was locked, so I threw
him the keys up through the sunroof, all the while my left arm was out
the left hand door and still touching his hand as he was standing on
the right had side of the car.</p>

<p class=dream>- - -</p>

<p class=dream>A couple of times I decided to write down the dream,
but I only dreamt I was writing it down.  and I was curious why Lee-eh
and Tammy seemed interchangeable in the dream, and Kenneth and Marcel
seemed interchangeable</p>

<p class=dream>Tammy I haven't seen in years, is a ex g/f friend is
gay, while tall, and lee-eh I have only hugged a shook hands wit, is a
current friend, and is short and japanese and I know nothing of her
orientation, but I know she has a had a boyfriend</p>

<p class=dream>Kenneth is black and gay and I haven't seen him in
years ad marcel is recent friend and is anti-gay and white thinks gay
is bad because the bible says so.</p>

<p class=date>1:30pm CDT Friday 3 May 2002</p></p>

<p>So far today I have logged 4.1 hours of time.  Nice.  Much more
productive than yesterday.  Special thanks to Kevin for helping me see
how I was getting off track (bogged down into details of code instead
of sticking with pseudo-code.)</p>

<p>I'm going to present my 3 hours worth of pseudocoding to Dave,
Minh, Kevin at 2pm after I eat.</p>

<p class=date>3:35pm</p>

<p>Just presented to them.  Got a "good job; this looks really nice"
or somesuch from Kevin.</p>

<p class=date>4:57pm</p>

<p>Just spent a bit over an hour to respond to a month worth of
feedback from users about the latest project I've been working on.
I responded to their comments, though they are from mid January to mid
February.  I'll respond to more next week.</p>

<p>So Tired.</p>

<p>Not so much sleepy yet because adrenaline is pouring throughout my
system.  My ears are ringing because I forgot my earplugs.</p>
 

<p>Just got back from Numbers with Amy, who I met through Gene, who I
met through Dude.  2.5 hours nearly solid Rob's Crazy Dance, to all the
great hits of the 80s.  Fluke, Ministry, Section 25, The GoGos, "New
York New York New York" with the video made up of clips from Robocop,
Euurythmics' "Here Comes The Rain Again" with a huge beat on top
keeping up the energy, Book Of Love's "Boy," "You Spin Me Round (Like a
Record)," and many more.</p>

<p>Notable:</p>

<p><ol><li>As we arrived, the dance floor was empty, as the music was s
- l - o - w.  Next song was still slow.  Next song was still slow
(although popular, though I haven't yet remembered what it was), and
the DJ came on over the mic, 'okay, folks this is the last song of the
night.....    Ah just kiddin''</li>
<li>I chugged two glasses of water during my one short break.</li>
<li>I was the first one out on the floor - as soon as we walked in, I
was out there alone.</li>
<li>On the way out, a guy tried to beg some money off us, and I gave
him instead of money a blessing that the lord take care of him, and I
gave him a hug.</li></ol></p>

<p>I have ultimate tomorrow at 9am.</p>

<p>1:30 am now.</p>

<p>After investment club, as I was about to dial Lee-eh, but then
decided not to because I realized it would be a pain to talk to her
while I was still packing my stuff, I clicked the button to lock my
phone again <em>*just*</em> as it rang and I thereby answered it, not
having had enough time to see the caller ID.</p>

<p>I presumed it was Lee-eh, but I was wrong, so I was all trying to
figure out the voice and I thought it was <a
href='https://www.amymultimedia.com'>Amy</a>, but wondered why she
would be calling me so late after we haven't IMed in a long time, and
she's never called me before out of the blue.</p>

<p>Turns out it was Marta, who I met at Plano Rally, and who just
recently emailed me saying her dad's friend is a recruiter for English
teachers in Japan!  But the more amazing thing about that is I hadn't
told her this was a particular interest of mine, only that I was
interested in traveling.  Wow.</p>

<p>So I'm looking forward to making a connection with Marta's dad's
friend and beginning the process of piecing this whole trip
together.</p>

<p class=date>2:36 am Friday 3 May 2002</p>

<p>Am just now home from Lee-eh's and Lauren's apartment, where I learned
the days of the week in Japanese.</p>

<p>Let's see...</p>

<p>Getsulobi
<br>Kalobi
<br>Tsulobi
<br>Thursday
<br>Kinlobi
<br>Kalobi
<br>Nichilobi</p>

<p>I think that's right except for Thursday, which has ku in it.</p>

<p>The apartment is cool - new carpet, etc, two bedrooms.  Lauren really
wants to get a big dog, and Lee-eh is more wanting a little dog.  Lauren
wants a short nose dog, Lee-eh wants a long nose dog.</p>

<p>I learned the brief version of Lauren's interesting upbringing and
current relationship situation.  Then I was reciting the lyrics to Ludakris
(sp) lyrics 'Roll out' (?) ('so much money.. you can't top that..') and she
has it on CD, so we listened to that so I could get a better grip on the
lyrics.</p>

<p>Something like, 'twin gloc fo'ties, cocked back/ me an' my homies, step
the fuck back/ rollin' on twenties, with the top back/ so much money, you
can't top that.'</p>

<p>Or some shit like that.</p>

<p>Lee-eh fell asleep on Lauren's bed as we traded music related stories -
her meeting band members, me meeting DJs.</p>

<p>Today I have officially begun budgeting carefully toward having
funds to visit Japan next year.  I'm paying off some debt and will be
monitoring my cashflow carefully for the next several months.</p>

<p>At work I haven't done as much today as an average day over the
past two weeks.  Hopefully tomorrow will feel more productive.  Did
help Minh get our DNS information updated for our work domains.</p>

<p>Tonight is investment club; it's a SSG training meeting, led by Kat
Pat, one of our star members.</p>

<p>After that, I'll call Lee-eh and learn some more Japanese.  :-)
Might get to see her apartment since investment club meeting is near
where she lives now.</p>

<p>Maybe that annoying guy with question marks all over his suit
shouting about free government grants is for real.</p>

<p>I paid $5.00 to find out.  I'll let ya know.</p>
