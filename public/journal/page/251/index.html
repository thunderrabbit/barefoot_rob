<p><strong>9:11pm Monday 13 May 2013</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve finished 56 seconds so far of Marble Track 3. The white and pink characters are gluing the 180 degree turn in the second corner (of four corners). I&rsquo;ve got plans in mind for the two center tracks.. hmm maybe I can scribble a bit on a photo. brb.</p>

<p><a href="//b.robnugen.com/art/marble_track_3/2013/05/IMG_2802.jpg"><img src="//b.robnugen.com/art/marble_track_3/2013/05/thumbs/IMG_2802.jpg" alt="IMG 2802" /></a></p>

<p>Okay so in the lower right corner, the white and pink guys are placing pieces for the second of four 180 degree turns in each corner.</p>

<p>In the lower left corner, the yellow guy with green backpack is placing a retaining wall on the first 180 degree turn that they made.</p>

<p>The green guy in the back is the cutter; he has nothing to do right now, so is just waiting.</p>

<p>The (future) 180 turns are marked with (dashed) black lines.</p>

<p>The red lines mark where the marbles will arrive after navigating the 180 degree turns.</p>

<p>The red spots on the edge of the center line mark where marbles will arrive after navigating the light blue and light green lines.</p>

<p>The light blue and light green dashed lines show where they marbles will roll before that.</p>

<p>The yellow dashed lines show where the marbles will probably roll before arriving at the 180 degree turns.  I&rsquo;m not sure what I&rsquo;ll do at the point marked with a yellow question mark.  I might make a switch there, but it&rsquo;s so low in the track that it wouldn&rsquo;t be very interesting.</p>

<p>I might have a switch there that decides between a red line arrival and a red dot arrival.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a decision for later, though; right now we&rsquo;re waiting for the glue to dry in the lower right corner so we can place another piece.</p>

<p>step by step</p>

<p><strong>12:45am Monday 13 May 2013</strong></p>

<p>Thanks to Rohini and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MoviesThatMatterTokyo">Movies That Matter Tokyo</a> crew for presenting <a href="https://siriusdisclosure.com/sirius-film-2/">Sirius</a> and Q&A; by <a href="https://jceti.org/?page_id=52">Greg Sullivan</a> of <a href="https://jceti.org/">jceti.org (Japan Center for Extraterrestrial Intelligence)</a></p>

<p>The movie presents four phenomena: many people have information about UFOs and are beginning to talk about it, free energy has been available for some time, there&rsquo;s a coverup of this information from the secret government, and a <a href="https://siriusdisclosure.com/evidence/atacama-humanoid/">small humanoid body was recovered in Acatama</a>, Chile.</p>

<p>In the Q&A; with Gregory, I asked if I can see in Tokyo or build for myself a free energy device.  He said the problem is not in the technology so much as our spiritual development; are we ready for free energy?</p>

<p>He leads CETI groups here in Japan; I&rsquo;d like to attend one!   Seems they just had one this weekend.</p>

<p>There are <a href="https://jceti.org/?page_id=91">several more screenings of Sirius</a>, and then in July another CETI event.  Nice!</p>

<p>To quote Jules, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo;; that&rsquo;s all there is to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Worked on Marble Track 3 some more today.  This time the green cutter guy cut four ice cream spoons, the pieces of which were distributed to the four corners of the track. I&rsquo;ve started gluing pieces at one of the corners.  I&rsquo;ll probably place some pieces on the two tracks that end along the center line of the track.</p>

<p><strong>1:20am Monday 13 May 2013</strong></p>

<p>I just added five more images and glued one more piece.</p>

<p><strong>8:13pm Saturday 11 May 2013</strong></p>

<p>The first time I started Marble Track 3, I was living in Motosumiyoshi.  I worked on it for a few months, iirc, before losing my job and moving to Soness&rsquo;s living room floor for two years.  The track was shelved and never finished, though I did work on it a bit once Lin and I moved to Kawasaki, but then part of it was broken and it got shelved again when I started working on iPhone apps with Tariq.</p>

<p>I started a new Marble Track 3 about a week ago, finished 17 seconds of animation before losing 80% of said animation due to getting what I paid for with free software.</p>

<p>Payday arrived yesterday and I bought a new marble track base (actually three new bases), and a license for iStopMotion after confirming it was more robust than FrameByFrame.</p>

<p>Four and a half hours later, this is how far I&rsquo;ve gotten.</p>

<p><a href="//b.robnugen.com/art/marble_track_3/2013/05/20130511-202214.jpg"><img src="//b.robnugen.com/art/marble_track_3/2013/05/thumbs/20130511-202214.jpg" alt="20130511-202214" /></a></p>

<p>So far, there are two (2) pieces glued to the base.  Looks like this is going to take a while.  :-)</p>

<p>Lin met Nonie at 6pm in Tokyo, where I joined them around 6:30pm.  We hadn&rsquo;t seen her for maybe a year since we saw her at Travis and Yumi&rsquo;s hike + overnight at some cabins somewhere.</p>

<p>Got to hear fun + weird stories about guests at Nonie&rsquo;s guest house in Chiba.  She&rsquo;s invited us to live there while she visits Europe this summer!  Interesting idea but not part of our reality yet; Lin&rsquo;s applying for a job that would preclude living in Chiba, but we&rsquo;ll see!</p>

<p>Ate surprisingly-expensive cheese and pizza at an Italian place, then not-surprisingly-expensive drinks at Starbucks, then inexpensive yummy ramen at another shop.</p>

<p>Today at work I had a brilliant idea to have prev(ious) and next buttons work as expected.</p>

<p>The blog entry index allows people to view e.g. only this category or that category or just this month or just last years entries.</p>

<p>Once they click the link to view a specific entry, the site has no idea what order nor what subset of entries was in the index.  I&rsquo;ve solved the problem in the past by storing in lawnchair a list of all the ids, in order, resulting from the search.  With 60,000 entries, that makes the index page slow because all that data is being searched and processes in the background.</p>

<p>While looking for a faster way to solve it, I realized an ingenious solution!!   I&rsquo;ll store in lawnchair the <em>query</em> and then just run the query with appropriate OFFSET and LIMIT to get the prev/next entries!</p>

<p>I got the query saved in lawnchair and was just about to AJAX the query to the server upon arrival at the blog entry page and I realized, OH CRAP!!  What an excellent system for running arbitrary SQL on the server!!!</p>

<p>(For the lay reader, this is a Very Bad Thing)</p>

<p>Crap.</p>

<p>So I scrapped my code and went back to my flexible A4 sized drawing board.</p>

<p>I dug around on SO a bit looking for insight and pretty much decided there&rsquo;s no way to do it without storing the query.  So the prevnext table was born.</p>

<p>Essentially, it&rsquo;s user_id and query_key as a grouped index, then a query as the query.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve got a class that talks to that table, and I think I&rsquo;m pretty close to having it work.  If it does work as planned, I&rsquo;ll probably port it to the system with 60,000 entries and make its index wonderfully faster.</p>

<p>I probably would have finished it today, but it&rsquo;s Friday night and Lin and I are going out with Nonie in Tokyo.</p>

<p><em>In karaoke, singing &ldquo;The Last Blueberry&rdquo; by Anikiko, I wanted to fast forward to the good part so quickly consumed the drink from the song carton.  It seemed a bit strange, but the guy with me agreed it was the fastest way to fast-forward the song: fast-drink the drink!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;<a href="https://nbsoftsolutions.com/blog/all-beautiful-code-starts-ugly">All beautiful code starts ugly</a>&rdquo; was my mantra today as I hacked in some changes to the abstract search class.  It now features a new function</p>

<pre><code>    public function setRidiculousStationJoin($bool = true) {
        $this-&gt;ridiculous_station_join = $bool;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The search() function went from this</p>

<pre><code>     protected function search($search_text = &quot;&quot;, $limit = 0, $page_num = 1){
         return $this-&gt;runSearchLimitOffset($search_text, $limit, $limit * (($page_num &gt; 0) ? $page_num - 1 : 0));
     }
</code></pre>

<p>to this</p>

<pre><code>     protected function search($search_text = &quot;&quot;, $limit = 0, $page_num = 1){
         if($this-&gt;ridiculous_station_join) {
             $this-&gt;creating_temp_table = true;
             $this-&gt;runSearchLimitOffset($search_text, $limit, $limit * (($page_num &gt; 0) ? $page_num - 1 : 0));
         }
         $this-&gt;creating_temp_table = false;
         if($this-&gt;ridiculous_station_join) {
             $this-&gt;join_temp_table = true;
         }
         return $this-&gt;runSearchLimitOffset($search_text, $limit, $limit * (($page_num &gt; 0) ? $page_num - 1 : 0));
    }
</code></pre>

<p>AND, inside runSearchLimitOffset are a buncha if statements asking if $this-&gt;create_temp_table / $this-&gt;join_temp_table are true, and behaving differently accordingly.</p>

<p>However, for the ugly hackiness, it works pretty well.</p>

<p>My sincere hope is one of two things:</p>

<p>1) we can convince the client that the request doesn&rsquo;t result in a good UX (*)  (30% likely)</p>

<p>2) I can clean up the code, or at least make it a bit more generalized</p>

<hr />

<p>(*) The request is to add another option to the select that tells what sort order to show results.</p>

<p>They want to add a &ldquo;group by&rdquo; option&hellip;  it makes no sense!  A user should be able to group by something <em>and</em> sort at the same time, but with this request, they can only do one or the other.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve realized that the obtuse requirements for a certain report will be a lot easier to create with temporary tables.</p>

<p>While digging around for info on temp tables, I found this <a href="https://blog.brianhartsock.com/2009/02/04/using-mysql-temporary-tables-to-save-your-brain/">gem of an DB example</a> by Brian Hartsock:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE `dogs` (
  `id` INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `name` VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
)
CREATE TABLE `legs` (
  `id` INT(10) UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `dog_id` INT(10) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
)
CREATE TABLE `nails` (
  `id` INT(10) UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `leg_id` INT(10) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
  `last_clipped` datetime NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
)
</code></pre>

<p>Hooray for toenail ids!</p>
