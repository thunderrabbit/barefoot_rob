<p class=date>2:37am Sunday 10 May 1998</p>

<p>Tonight Wende and I went to a new dance club called SHOCK. I had gotten on the guest list by calling my homey John Leach at radio station KTBZ 107.5 The Buzz on Thursday night. I asked him about the new club and what was the dress code. I was like, "you're going to be there on Saturdays?"

<p>And he goes, "yeah; do you want to be on the guest list?"

<p>"Tight," I exclaimed firmly when he signed me up.

<p>So tonight Wende and I went and I danced and she sat and watched me dance. She says she had more fun that it may have appeared, so I'm glad about that.

<p>When we got there, I said HI to John Leach and introduced Wende.

<p>Wende didn't want to dance, but I had a super marvelous time fast fast fast dancing to fairly good music. Not as overall fast as Numbers, but pretty good.

<p>I danced for almost 1.5 hours (I think) and flirted some but mostly kept to myself.

<p class=date>2:44am Sunday 10 May 1998<br>
wow. I've nearly fallen asleep twice as I type this.

                        <p><title>Deep Impact</title></p>

<p class=date>Saturday 9 May 1998</p>

<p>Eric and I just went to see Deep Impact.  I will "review" the movie in two different parts.  I say "review" because I've never done this before; we'll see how it turns out.

<p><font size=+1>Technically</font>, the movie had tons of flaws.
Here's what I can think of off the top of my head:

<ul>

<p><li>In the very opening scene a kid saw the comet in a telescope and knew it was not a star since it wasn't on the charts. Fine. The astromer instructor dude goes, "it's probably a satellite."<br>
NO!! Satellites visibly move across the sky.  The object was fuzzy looking; a satellite in that size telescope would have been sharp... Unless of course the telescope was focused on a star.  But it would have been moving.</li>

<p><li>Astronauts flew a big ship to go destroy the comet. Fine.
But they flew through the tail of the comet, and huge chunks of rock and ice were flying off of it.<br>
NO!! A comet's tail is <em>dust</em>. Dust!</li>

<p><li>And they <b>landed</b> on it and were walking around on it.<br>
NO!! A comet 7 miles across does not have enough mass so they can <em>land</em> on it and walk around on it!  The tiniest hint of pressure would send them tumbling away into the nothingness.</li>

<p><li>And the tail was only tens of miles long (judging by the size of the comet, which was 7 miles across in the movie).<br>
NO!!  Comet tails are tens of millions of miles long.</li>

<p><li>When the comet hit earth, it came in at a pretty shallow angle and sailed gloriously across the sky.  Fine.  I guess.
But when it hit the earth, a mushroom cloud exploded straight up, with impact blast in a perfect circle!<br>
NO!! All the momentum woulda blown everything that direction! Momentum is conserved!!</li>
</ul>

<p>Argh!

<p>Okay.

<p>The special effects of the various cities and stuff being destroyed were pretty good.  Interesting camera angles.

<p>And now, the good parts of the movie..

<p>First, the premise was that the United States was going to house one million people in underground caves for two years. They specifically chose two hundred thousand people and were going to randomly select eight hundred thousand people.

<p>Some excellent philosophical questions were brought up.

<p>Here are a few off the top of my head:

<p><ul>
<li>What if you were chosen to live? Would you go?</li>
<li>What if you were chosen and your (significant person in your life) were not?</li>
<li>Would you give up your space so they could go?</li>
<li>If you knew you would die, would you run screaming?</li>
<li>If you knew you would die, would you face your death proudly?</li>
<li>If you thought you might live, would you kill yourself because life would be so crappy afterwards anyway?</li>
</ul>

<p>Those are just some questions that bounced through my mind.

<p>So it brings up some good questions, and had the entire theater sniffling back tears.  I was sniffling back tears at the parts designed to be tear-jerking... and the technical errors, too.</p>

<p class=date>Saturday 9 May 1998</p>

<p>Wende is basically moved out.  Maggie, Eric and I packed mostly all her stuff and brought it to her new apartment while John and Wende drove to Dallas and got her bed and bureau and stuff.

<p>Once we were done for the day, we got pizza from Star Pizza across the street (I expect Wende will get frequent flyer miles there because it's so good and so accessible).  We ate and then I drove with Maggie to her house to pick up Wende's truck while Wende unpacked.

<p>I came back and spent the night with Wende, to help her transition into her new place. Now I'm at home ready to clean up and get some stuff caught up.

<p>Her cats are still here, so she's not totally out yet.</p>

<p><p>This morning I went to my chiropractor to let her adjust my
back.. My lower back was still hurting after gymnastics on Tuesday.
She popped it and stuff but it still hurt. I got up and was all, &ldquo;it
doesn&rsquo;t feel much better.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>So she had me lay down and she accupunctured me. 6 needles right in
the area and they didn&rsquo;t hurt at all, but I could feel them and my
awareness was really brought to the painful part of me spine.  She had
me lift one hip and oooooohh wow that feels better.</p>

<p><p>I was amazed.  After about 8 minutes with needles in my back, it
feels absolutely entirely better. I am really impressed.</p>

<p class=date>Wednesday 6 May 1998</p>

<p>Dinner this night was at Chuck E. Cheese's and we had 14 youth show up!  That's the most we've had at any Wednesday night dinner.  We had representation from 3 or 4 churches!

<p>A great time was had by all, I believe.  I mostly didn't spend many tokens.  Probably about 1 dollar worth and then I just watched the youth doing various games and stuff.

<p>Paul did super great on Solar Attack (or something like that) big video screen video game, getting past any level I had seen on it.

<p>We had super great fun in the ball pit, with about 10 of us in there, throwing the balls all over the place (mostly inside the maze of tubes) and having a chaotic wonderful time.

<p>After a couple of hours, parents wandered back to pick up their respective youth and we all left.

<li>Wow-  I haven&rsquo;t written in a while.  Lots of stuff has happened but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll get caught up.</li>

<li>I&rsquo;ve been messing with it a bit each day and will hopefully have a 56k modem working soon, and then I&rsquo;ll get the Feel Good Net going again, which hasn&rsquo;t gone out in 2.5 weeks because THEY at my JOB say &ldquo;thou shalt not surf&rdquo; while at work.<br>
I&rsquo;m surfing now!!! HA HAHAHAahaahaahhaa</li>

<p class=date>5 May 1998</p>

<p>Tonight in gymnastics I did some pretty cool stuff. I did round off back flips but did not get them as layouts very well at all. We were on a different floor which seemed softer than the other.  I don't know if that really made a difference or not.

<p>But I did do a few russian front flips. "Russian" in that case is the style of motion used to power the flip. Arms swing in big forward circles and then lift from the back kinda. It's easier if I show you but I'm probably not physically with you as you read this. Maybe later.

<p>I bounced around on the runway tramp and just did a backflip with 1/2 twist. Cool. So I did it again and almost wacked the wall. Hmmm. So I did it again and after not too long pretty much had them stable and consistent. Half the time I would do a back branny (twist as I flip) and half the time I would do the beginning of an arabian (flip, and then twist). Cool stuff.

<p>Then Ryan and I got on the big trampolines and challenged each other to a front flip contest. We would flip and flip and flip and flip,... doing front flips and landing on our backs each time. Our feet never touched the trampoline.<br>
So anyway, we each got like 10 in a row, and by that time were pretty much too tired and dizzy to do much else.<br>
At least I was too tired. Ryan did some other stuff which I couldn't do and can't describe either, so oh well.

<p>It was a super fun night.</p>

<p>Its beAn two weeks, but I'll start from Friday night and see where it gets me.

<p>First thing I remember was Eryn Pope, Austin Roth, Nora and I were all
sitting outside in the courtyard around 8-8:30 just layin on each others
tummies talkin, Nora is from Germany (as you all know) so we were
askinh er
all sorts of silly questions about Germany, and Austin was talkin about
tummies, and it was just jolly fun.

<p> Eventually after about 15 minutes of that, Susanne came outside to
tell us
Stillwater was here! YEAH!! I ran inside to see my '97 SWUUSI friends
Clark
and Noah.  I was so happy to see them, and quickly showed them around
and put
on some music, and everyone danced for about 30 minutes, it was
glorious fun,
and I loved re-kindling my friendships w/ Clark and Noah.

<p>        They were really thirsty, so we made our way to the kitchen to make
coffee,
oh goodness, this was a task.  After about 5 minutes of looking for the
coffee, we found it behing the coffee maker. (right where Noah said it
would
be)  None of us knew how to use the machine, so we just kind of
guessed.  We
found a filter, and put it, somewhere, and put the coffee grounds
somewhere
else, and poured some water somewhere else, and well, eventually, we
got water
everywhere and ruined a packet of coffee, oops. 

<p>        I left for a few minutes to see what else was happening around the
church, I
was afraid they'd kill me if I stayed in there any longer, and when I
got back
Clark had the machine up and running, and he used it the whole weekend,
that
boy loves coffee, and loves to spill it on others.  

<p>        After making the coffee, they played around with the big wooden ladel
for a
while, then tryed to spray each other with the water shooter, but
eventually,
and after I had to kick 'em out of the kitchen, we got bored being
inside and
went outside to chill.

<p>        Noah is quite the climber, so he had no trouble making it to the top
of the
tree in the courtyard faster than lightning.  We were all gasping and
gazing.a
Only problem was, we couldn't get him to come down!!! 

<p>        Finally he made his wy down the tree, and just sat with us till more
people
arrived.  The next people to arrive were the Mckeons and well, half of
Fort
Worth.   They went in and took their pictures, and we all sat down to
Susanne's wonderful guitar playing.  We sang Cat Stevens, and the
Beatles
mostly, with a little extra stuff thrown in on the sides.  Noah was
playing my
drum, and Misty (the dog from Stillwater) was just runnin around being
cute, I
love to sing, and Susanne is great, so that exceptionally nice.

<p>                After a while, and all at one time it seems, a whole big group of
faces got
here from San An and Fort Worth.  One of them my SWUUSI '96 friend
Nathan
Sexton from Fort Worth.  They all come in, and lots of hugs were given,
introductions were made, and after spinning around the floor for a very
long
time, and showing Lauren Dodski from San An where she'd be sleeping, we
went
back to Daniel Hall for more dancing, a little Hokey Pokey, and more
people,
and more introductions, it was crazy, and so much fun.  

<p>        All of this went on for several hours, and eventually when it seemed
like
everyone who was coming was here, we sat down for opening circle. 
Mairead and
Jeanne did an OK job explaing rules and stuff, but when Frank tried to
say the
co-theme (You got screwed by one smooth vacuum while Debe did OKC on a
big
ball of twine in front of Sgt. Bills army surplus + tools, then Adam
got bit
by a dog.) He messed up, and Melissa had to cover for him. After the
opening
speeches, and everyone going around and saying their names with an
adjective
starting with the same letter as their name (you know the game) we all
seperated into TOUCH GROUPS. 

<p>        I was in the red touch group, Sean Murray, touch group leader.  My
touch
group consisted of Me, Noah Weatherford, Mojo Norman, Sean Murray,
Christina
Lusk, Tommy Faitak, and Arlene Dormio. (I think thats all)  

<p>        We had some interesting conversations, but nothing to keep us too
entertained, so we decided to go do some walking.

<p>        I went outside looking for anyone I knew, and ended up sitting on the
benches
to talk.  Clark, Noah, Nathan, Lisa (from Stillwater), and some other
people
whose names don't spring to mind talked for a while, and pretty much
just
bonded.  

<p>        Sometime later I went inside to hang out with Rob, Jen Colbert, Katie,
Kat,
and Nathan.  We talked about lots of stuff, mostly how its my first
rally, and
music, and just lots of wild stuff, it was great Rob spent forever
trying to
get Kaite's last name right, sad to say, he was unsuccesful, but it was
fun to
watch him try so hard.  

<p>        After many minutes of talking, we decided to do some more walking and
ended
up outside on the steps w/ Clark and Noah. We stayed there for I guess
about 3
hours, just talking and chttin it up, but we got cold, so I went and
got my
sleeping bag, as did everyone else, and as we snuggled up to sleep, we
realized (sadly), that there wasn't room for 5.  So Nathan and I went
and
slept beside the benches.  Nathan on my feet keeping them warm (thanks
again
Nathan).  

<p>        I woke up about an hour later to the sound of Adam Lock and others
telling
sexual and racist jokes.  It was a great way to wake up.  Clark, Noah,
Kat,
and Katie, weren't asleep, so I went and talked to them, but
eventually, they
passed out so I walked inside with Aaron Ivener, and he and I split a
blueberry bagel for breakfast.  I went back outside, but no-ones
conversation
was entertaining me, so I woke up Nathan, and he and I explored the
church
hidden under his magic sleeping bag.  

<p>        On the second floor, we picked up Dennis Kalman, and dragged him down
to
breakfast. (what can we say, the boy looked hungry.)  Then we walked
around
the outside of the church, just checkin out the beautiful spring trees,
and
flowers we were just bein silly. 

<p>        After that, we went and sat on the outside stairs, and talked for a
couple
hours w/ everyone else.  Nathan is quite the massuse, so he gave about 6
backrubs to just everyone.  It was great.  Once the sun was completely
up, We
got tired, so we went back to sleep.  

<p>        I woke up about an hour later, but Nathan was still asleep, so I went
inside
to talk to everyone.  Austin, John, and some others were playing drums
inside,
and there was a huge circle of guitarists outside, along with all the
smokers.

<p>        Everyone still seemed to be on the steps, so there I went.  Not sure
what
happended next, but eventually, Nathan, Clark, Andy Artus, Austin Artus,
Gavin, and I all started playing football, with a tiny little thing
that was
eventually popped *but not by us* Gavin and Clark tryed multiple times
to
catch the ball while skateboarding..... it didn't work too well, but
man did
they look hilarious.  

<p>        Soon Clark, Nathan and I all got in a little catch circle to play
around with
Austin.  He refused to throw me the ball making me feel horrible, but
its ok.

<p>        After a  while of that, a frisbee appeared and we ran to make its
aquaintance.  Nathan and I played a while, until Misty insisted on
playing.
Nathan tryed throwing the frisbee to Misty, but after she caught it she
wouldn't give it back to him.  They wrestled around with the frisbee
for a
while, until eventually Nathan threw the frisbee and we ran inside to
hide. 

<p>        A few of us then went into the "loungin" room to watch anime.  I don't
really
like anime, but someone was giving me a back massage so I was happy. 
But
then, Nick felt like ruining my day, and turned my over, and PHUUFed
me!!!!!!!
AHH!!!! It was crazy!! I didn't know what to say! I was giggling like
crazy,
because I'm so ticklish, it was a lot better than I thought it would
be, but
oh my goodness, it was crazy!  The about 15 minutes later FRANK PHUUFed
me
too!!!!!  This was getting rediculous, so we left and went back to
Daniel
Hall.  Nathan Ryan took some time to show me the YAC rally books, and
explain
some of the cool stuff in it to me.  He also showed me the new book,
and gave
me the honor of signing it.

<p>        We came back outside, and I started hacky sackin' with a few random
people,
but I suck, so I stopped after a bit.  It was really, really hot
outside,
everyone was burnin' like bacon, so we took our sleeping bags and went
and
laid out on the grass.  After that, I went and talked to Jeremy
Loomis-Noris,
Chris Anderson, and some other people about crazy stuff, a few of the
people
sitting with us were painting their nails, but I couldn't keep my eyes
of
Chris's cool body painting, maybe it was just cause hes so cute. hee hee

<p>        I went inside because, I think,  it was time for dinner, YUM! I hadn't
eaten
much lunch so I was smilin.  I came outside with my food and sat down
next to
Keith on the bench across from Jeremy.  After getting into a long
debate with
Jeremy about why I think Lettuce tastes like strawberries, (which it
does) and
how I was horrible at eating spaghetti, I felt very silly, so we went
inside
to contra dance.  

<p>        I only danced the warm-up dance, but I used to contra all the time so
I did
ok.  Noah was behind me though, and he kept tripping me and at one
point made
me fall down bringing a line of people with me, it was crazy,
embarassing, and
great fun!      After that we went outside and snuggled under sleeping
bags for
what seemed like forever. They started playing music outside, the first
song I
remember was Prodigy, along w/ Vanilla Ice, and MC Hammer. Jen Colbert
and I
had dancing urges, and couldn't stop, so we danced forever, making
complete
fools of ourselves, even though Scotty Hakel repeatedly told us to
stop.  It
was great.  Everyone was dancing, and having a blast.  I started hiding
under
my magic sleeping bag, but everyone kept finding me, so I said "oh
well" and
stopped hiding.         After contra, Kitty Rankin had gotten a cool little
disco
thing goin down stairs so we all moved down there to dance. Everyone
got bored
quickly, with somewhat luke-happy music, and after about 5 minutes, we
all
moved back upstairs.  So we sat again, and talked again, and after a
couple
hours of this, someone came out and told us it was almost time for
worship.  

<p>         We went in the childrens chapel to a candle lit room. Nathan Ryan put
us in
two circles, and we all went around telling everyone what we wished
they would
say to us. It was extremely great and everyone said the coolest stuff. 
I felt
so wonderful.  Then we stood on one side of the room, and half of us
crossed
our hands over our chest, and the other half, came and did some kind of
gesture to everyone that was important to them.  Then the other half of
the
room repeated.  It was so wonderful.  This was just my first rally, but
everyone was just so great, I got and gave about a hundred hugs, and a
few of
us were pretty close to tears *me included* It was so great, and what a
wonderful worship it was!  We all stayed around for a while, smiling and
giving hugs, but eventually once again we went dowstairs to sit and chat
again.  

<p>        It was pretty early since the worship started ahead of schedule (a
first),
but since they had to wait for the last candle to burn out, when it
did, we
started the talent show.  Misty came up and snuggled my leg which made
me feel
all happy because she hadn't been nice to me all weekend!  But the
talent show
was exceptional.  

<p>        Sean burped Blackbird which was about the funniest thing I had ever
seen or
heard, ask him to do it sometime, it had me rolling.  Then Shira 
and
Adam Lock did a striptease to CAKE's "shut the fuck up" and flexed their
ensorpently-strong muscles for us.  I have to say, I'm pretty sure
Shira has
Adam beat, but it was still hilarious.  Then Kris Scott, Aaron Ivener,
and
Danny K. sung a few songs and entertained the masses.  We were all
asked to
turn around and look behind us, and before I knew what was happening,
two girls
were backstroking across the wooden floor of Daniel Hall, oh my god, it
was
hilarious!!! Swimming on dry land, a great idea!!!!!    

<p>        After the talent show was over, a few different people sat down in
front of
the sanctuary to play a rousing game of silent football.  It was my
first game
and I had a little trouble getting the hang of it.  But I wasn't the
only one.
Kris Scott passed the sacred football to Danny K, and all of a sudden,
Danny
jumped out of the universe, and was gone.  Then, the evil anti-Danny
appeared
(though I think it might have been jeremy) and since  Mr. Dictator
couldn't
get Danny back, and anti-danny was sent away, we continued the game
without
them everything was getting very confusing, but oh man, was it
hilarious.   

<p>        I was not the only one totally lost.  As I said, I didn't quite catch
on that
fast, and the terms had fun slipping my memory.  I kept on forgetting
what a
"fwap" was called, and called it a "fish" something or other, and got
mulitple
penace points for not knowing what the hell I was talking about.

<p>        Then Austin,  kris, and Keith got in a huge battle over gestures and
things
outside the universe (FRANK) and penace points were given left and
right, and
by that time, I had started to think that everyone else was as lost as
me.
They are all seriously psychotic.  They went back and forth accusing
each
other of this and that forever, and even forgot to charge me with using
the
most hanous [bad spelling] pronoun "he". (YEAH) At this point, I had 4
and a
half penace points, and everyone else was close behind.  But all of a
sudden,
some source from within the universe started making the gravitational
pull
around my head jerk up and down, taking my head with it.  My head
started
bobbin', and before I knew it, I had a penace point (thanks Kris) and I
had
lost the game!!!!! I was tired though, so I didn't mind much. My
punishment
was to sing "one little two little three little indians", which I
didn't know
the ending to, at closing circle (oops, I forgot.)

<p>        After clearing out, I was tired, so I went in the loungin room, and
went to
sleep. Someone woke me up about 30 minutes later, as it was 7:00, and
time to
wake up and clean.  I cleaned fast, and went to lay down in the loungin
room
with Katie and Keith.  We just chilled for about an hour talking and
snoozin'.

<p>        Then it was time for closing circle. I was getting sad at the thought
of
departure of all my new-found friends, but as always, I had to say
goodbye.
After singing the coconut song, the banana song, and some others, the
seniors
formed their circle, and we sang the closing song. It was so sad, and
man, was
I holdin back tears.  The mugbooks were passed out, and I hugged
EVERYONE at
least 3 or 4 times.  MOJO and I did our special handshake, and Jeremy
and I
almost fell down giving each other bear hugs.  It was absolutley the
happiest
and saddest I had been in a long time, especially all at the same time.
 I
turned around hug after hug, and soon, everyone had gone, and there was
noone
to hug, so I went and curled up on one of the couches in the high
school room,
closed my eyes, and went to sleep.

<p class=date>22 April 1998</p>
<p>
My brother Fred and I have begun work on a site of our genealogy- our immediate and extended family as far back and wide as we care to go. The site is incomplete (and may never be made public), so you can't see it right now.
<p>
I only talk about it here because that work has been taking up a lot of time lately..
<p>
We currently have pages essentially for our mom's immediate family.

<p class=date>Wednesday 22 April 1998</p>
<p>
This night the LRY met at Ninfa's for dinner. As we arrived there were no parking spaces available in two parking lots; I dropped off Wende and parked across 8-lane Westheimer. Just as I got back, millions and millions of men (well, maybe fifty) came out, all comfortably wearing white shirts, khaki pants, work boots! Most had pagers, cell phones, and/or tape measures!
<p>
Turns out it was a quarterly meeting of home builder managers. They left behind plenty of open parking spots.
<p>
At dinner was me, Wende, Laura, Jon, Bryce (friend of Jon's; first time to our dinners), kT and Dennis. We had big fun, and I was happy that kT and Laura took a couple of pictures for our scrapbook. I think creating their scrapbook will help bond the group even more.  Yay!
<p>
Next week, Niko Niko's!
