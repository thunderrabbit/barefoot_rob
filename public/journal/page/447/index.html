<p>I just feel all poopypants, as Wende would say.  And I don't mean
diarrhea, although I did just eat 12 ounces of chocolate covered
cherries while I'm "trying" to work on Kim's website.</p>

<p>I've had an overall energy sucky lethargy that I can't seem to
shake.  I don't feel safe enough here to cry, but maybe I will when
Steve goes to dinner with his daughter tonight.  Aw fuck this just
sucks big crap.</p>

<p class=date>4:29pm CDT Monday 14 October 2002</p>

<p>Maybe I should just go to sleep for a while.  But then I feel
scared to miss Kim's phone call.  Fuck fuck fuck.  This is just
absolutely stupidity.</p>

<p class=date>4:46pm</p>

<p>Today I learned there is a sauna in this house.  It's in the
basement.  I bet a sauna is a great place to cry.</p>

<p class=date>6:13pm</p>

<p>Well, I didn't really cry, but I did fall asleep near a thermometer
reading 135 degrees F.  It was near me, but also right above the
heater.  I was next to the heater, so not quite as hot.  But I did
sweat after about 20 minutes.  I was in there for almost 1 hour.</p>

<p>I feel a tad better.  A tad.</p>

<p class=date>9:26pm CDT Monday 14 October 2002</p>

<p>Finally.  I bawled my eyes out as I wrote to Kim, telling him that
I don't really have anyone to talk to.  On some levels I feel so alone
out here on my grand adventure.  And that's just part of the package
that I've chosen for myself.  I definitely feel a lot better after
crying.  Good job me.</p>

<p>Still not perfect, but better.</p>

<p>I had lots of anti-war dreams last night.  Stuff indicating that
Bush is a liar, and that going to war unilaterally would disrupt a
grander human cycle of life, and that it's just a bad idea, and other
stuff.</p>

<p>Argh.</p>

<p class=date>10:38am</p>

<p>There.  I've just written an email to Bush, letting him know I
don't approve of war, and that I've not found anyone along my trek who
does.</p>

<pre>
From: rob@robnugen.com
To:   President@whitehouse.gov
Subj: Please no war

President Bush

I am Rob Nugen, from Houston Texas.  In June I was layed off from my
computer job (not Enron) and decided to take a road trip around these
beautiful United States.

Everyone with whom I have spoken does not want us to go to war with
Iraq.  I've talked to people in Austin, Dallas, Norman OK, Oklahoma
City OK, Tulsa OK, Memphis TN, Barboursville WV, Columbus OH, Oberlin
OH, and now Kalamazoo MI.  I have not met a single person who wants us
to go to war.

My understanding from our media is that The CIA greatly believes that
unilateral war with Iraq would make the United States less safe, not
more safe.  Please trust their judgement.

I hope you are not trying to use this war just to get a second term in
office, or to distract United States citizens from our internal
problems of corrupt business and environmental decline.  I beg you to
think of the larger world view.

What is best for the world?  The utter supremacy of the United States?
So that we become *the* target of choice for every two-bit dictator
who wants to rule the world?

Please listen to our friends in the UN.  Please don't try to attack
Iraq in some display matching that of a bully in a playground.  Nobody
likes a bully.  The UN doesn't either.  Let's realign ourselves with
the UN's consensus of how to handle this world situation.  Then lots
more people in the world will like us and we'll have a lot more
allies, a wonderful asset in this world.

    Thank you
    - Rob

<p>Downstairs in the free (!) laundry facilities of this dorm.  Wow.
Plus there are ethernet connections on the wall here (outside the
laundry room in the lounge), but they seem not to work.</p>

<p>The three washers are being used now, so I'll just reply to email
while I'm waiting.</p>

<p class=date>2:19pm</p>

<p>Laundry is done.  I got seven emails written.</p>

<p>So as I meditatively collected my stuff (I think I got it all this
time!) from Joana's, after laundry and good quality Rob Time, I chose
not to listen to the voice mail messages on my phone since I would
have plenty of time to listen while I was on the road.</p>

<p>Joana helped me bring my stuff out, and upon one more pass of her
dorm, I discovered I had forgotten my sleeping bag!  But I got it, and
she walked me out again and hugged and "bye."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Listened to my voice mails and it was Carina, informing me that she
would not be able to host me at her apartment at this time.  She
seemed to be possibly crying, but not letting on to it.  Said
something about her boyfriend and her going to be down in Evansville,
6 hours away.</p>

<p>Wow.  So that was to be my next stop, where I planned to stay until
Wednesday when I met Steve in Chicago.  Steve and I specifically chose
6pm Wednesday night to meet so that he would be most available to say
HI and stuff.</p>

<p>Hmmm..</p>

<p>I have just gotten gas ($1.539/gallon) and am in their parking lot
to write this entry.  I'm choosing not to call upon Joana, who
certainly needs to get back to her life.  I'll call Steve and see if
he wants to just say HI this evening and then I can move on to
Bloomington IL tomorrow morning.  I might just go to Bloomington now.
(That's where Maggie and Molly's mom lives.)</p>

<p class=date>4:20pm</p>

<p>Aw fuck.  I also just realized that today I asked Barbie to snail
my clear plastic folder to Steve's house.  Fortunately today is Sunday
and she can't likely have mailed it already.  Blah.</p>

<p>I called Carina and she said she wasn't crying during that
message.  That's good to hear.  Okay. I'm going to call Steve now.
Actually Barbie first and then Steve.</p>

<p class=date>4:38pm</p>

<p>Okay.  I'm going to meet up with Steve today at the house where
he's house sitting.  I know the house seated person basically as well
as I know Steve (from chats online) and he's going to call her to
confirm that it's cool if I visit.  He's sure it will be.  I am
too.</p>

<p>It's quite Wende (oops)  windy today.  Scott wants to blow all over
the road it seems.  Probably should stop typing and driving with my
knee.</p>

<p>K.  bye.</p>

<p class=date>6:45pm</p>

<p>Not so many miles away from Chicago now - like 35 I think.  I just
stopped to P at McDonald's.  Didn't buy anything except gas next door
for $1.359 per gallon.</p>

<p>Been talking to Kristen for a while.  She said Katharine broke her
foot and has tired of people calling with cliches to help her feel
better.  I'll call and say something like, "well, you know what they
say, 'a broken foot in the hand is worth two in the bush,' or 'a
broken foot in time saves nine,' or something equally absurd.</p>

<p>2502 miles traveled since Dallas.</p>

<p>I want to eat.  But actually I just feel sad and want to eat to
block that emotion.  I'm sad about not going to San Antonio Rally.
I'm going to miss you guys like crazy.</p>

<p>I'm sad that I can't tell you why I can't go.  I fucked up and
pissed some people off and now I'm not going.  I've been asked to also
not attend Houston Rally.  I really really really want to go to
Houston.  That's effectively my last rally ever.</p>

<p>I love you guys so much.  You're so smart and capable and
beautiful.  So funny and daring and awesome.  Thank you for the
opportunity to help you grow.</p>

<p>Joana didn't wake up until like 11:30am, which is apparently quite
late for her.  I was chatting with her suitemate Meagan, encouraging
her to do a study abroad in Australia, or actually anywhere.  She's
currently considering either Australia, Spain, Ecuador, or not going
at all.</p>

<p>Joana and their other suite mate came in and we (mostly they) all
chatted and gossipped about stuff and things.  Meagan was studying
spanish, and is now studying organic chemistry out on campus
somewhere.</p>

<p>Mattboy and Joel just visited Kalamazoo on their way from Ann Arbor
to Chicago for a show for which they have been put on the guest list,
but don't know if they'll be able to get it since it's a 21+ club.</p>

<p>We chatted a bit, then played some disc out in the field while
Joana watched and studied art history of Greece.  Frisbee throwing
turned to fruit throwing since a tree had deposited plenty of its
fruits on the ground around it.  When Matt and Joel got into a
wrestling match, Joana hid the frisbees so we went across the street
and climbed up onto a wall that was fairly accessible.  We joked that
it was a psychology experiement.  That would be our excuse if anyone
got mad.</p>

<p>A security car (not white) went by and didn't see us because his
view of us was blocked by trees until he was basically right across
from us in the street.  hahahaha security car.</p>

<p>We were up there joking about ways to get down, including jumping
fantastic distances to the tree that would bend over and allow us to
jump to that wire and then down onto the car, etc etc.  Just as Joel
was ready to get down, some students came out of the building so I was
all, "wait; let's see if they see us."</p>

<p>They did.  The girl was all, "what are you doing up there?"</p>

<p>"Um, a psychology experiment," I told her.</p>

<p>"blahbhalabhab?"</p>

<p>I couldn't hear her.  "What?"</p>

<p>"And your professor approved this?  For you to be on the wall?
Cause you really shouldn't be up there."</p>

<p>"Um, not exactly approved."</p>

<p>"Then you need to get down."</p>

<p>"Okay."</p>

<p>We obliged, with Rowboat almost tumbling into the sidewalk down the
hill off the wall.  I couldn't tell if he was faking or not, since he
had joked about that possibility.</p>

<p>By the time we got fully down, she was long gone.  "Aw man, we
coulda stayed up there," joked Applejack.   Oh well.</p>

<p>Disc with Joana as well and then we sat a bit and traded Mitch
Hedberg jokes.  Matt and Joel know way more than me.</p>

<p>Rowboat was ready to go, so Applejack and I played the frisbee game
that I showed to Sean, but that we didn't really figure out rules to
it.  (Each player takes turns throwing, and tries to land his/her disc
on the other players disc.  Basically the throws will be closer and
closer together until they touch.  But they get too easy when it's
only 1 foot away, which is the problem Sean and I found.)  The perfect
rule is that when the discs get close to each other, the players have
to do tricky throws (e.g. behind the back, summersault, foot throws,
kicking, bounce off trees, hit with stick or fruit, etc etc).  This
made the game much more interesting and more like a New Game instead
of a competitive game.</p>

<p>Hugs to them and they are off to Chicago.  I will be leaving for
Chicago tomorrow.</p>

<p>I got some more mp3s from Caycee today.  I now have 2 days worth of
music and such.  Joana and I listened to all my Mitch Hedberg.  Funny
stuff.</p>
