<p>Great day at a park near Yoga station, though I&rsquo;ve forgotten its name.</p>

<p>Travis and I played frisbee, and were joined by some young kids,
pretty much all of whom could throw better than I would expect given
their apparent ages.</p>

<p>I took a picture of Lin in front of a mimosa tree.</p>

<p>Yumi took some high speed video with her phone and it was fun watching them in slow motion.</p>

<p>We moved!  Our new house is great, though a bit farther from the station.  However, that gives me a chance to take a walk each morning and evening.  I allocate 30 minutes walking time each direction.  Not sure how far it actually is, but probably around 2km.  2.6km according to Google.</p>

<p>The key words for this house are big and nice.  Oh, and cats (surrounding).</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t have internet connected yet, but have fiber installed in our living room!  Now my computer will be the bottleneck; that&rsquo;s amazing.</p>

<p>Yesterday I went to an electric shop looking for coaxial cable for the TV connection.  (sigh)   They only had 5m max (not nearly far enough to reach the station!!) but I needed 15 meters (routed at right angles along the edges of the room) to reach the spot where Lin wants the TV.  They said it would take a day at 9800 yen to make.  Ummmmm no thanks.</p>

<p>On the way home, I saw an <del>old guy</del> elderly gentleman in a shop that looked like my dad&rsquo;s garage.   I scoped the signs and could read enough to know he was a handyman.  I was like, &ldquo;hey, uh, do you happen to have coaxial TV cable?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had to dig around a bit, but the short version is YES, he made 15 meters and gave it to me free.  whoooooo!!!!</p>

<p>Just finished meeting with Tomomi and Sho about phase three of their
website.  I&rsquo;m thankful that Tomomi took into consideration the
existing technologies we&rsquo;ve used on the site when planning how to do
the next steps.  My next steps are to create some rough mockups and
estimate time required to make the changes.</p>

<p>I think they are from a hike, but I&rsquo;m surprised they&rsquo;re labeled 21 December; wouldn&rsquo;t that be too cold???</p>

<p>Lin and I are at a restarea; I&rsquo;ve just coded up the new class in my
latest iPhone project.  I designed it and wrote out the functions on
the way to Mt Fuji yesterday.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This morning&rdquo; we woke up at 2:10am to climb Mt Fuji.  I took notes,
which I hope to transcribe into here, but in case I don&rsquo;t, the TLDW
(too long didn&rsquo;t write) version is: &ldquo;10 hours up; 4.5 hours down.&rdquo;  In
the extra space, I&rsquo;ll write &ldquo;Saw four guys carrying mountain bikes up
the mountain (but didn&rsquo;t see them ride down)&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>12:14pm Sunday 19 May 2013</strong></p>

<p>Though it&rsquo;s a lot slower than Wordpress (and only version 0.8.2), I&rsquo;m enjoying using <a href="https://koken.me/">Koken</a> on my site; it looks beautiful and seems to handle images more inclusively rather than as a tacked-on thing.</p>

<p>So for a while, robnugen.com/blog may see fewer entries while I play with robnugen.com/koken.</p>

<p>If I really like it, I&rsquo;ll make /koken be default for my site.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve finished a minute and 21 seconds worth of Marble Track 3 video.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s exactly one piece that crosses over another track.  In the image below, the pink character is standing on that piece which is marked with black.</p>

<p><a href="//b.robnugen.com/art/marble_track_3/2013/05/IMG_2813x1000.jpg"><img src="//b.robnugen.com/art/marble_track_3/2013/05/thumbs/IMG_2813x1000.jpg" alt="IMG 2813x1000" /></a></p>

<p>The other pieces marked in black are the continuation of that track, which ends in the lower middle of MT3. (hmm I&rsquo;m using the word &ldquo;track&rdquo; to describe a single track and &ldquo;track&rdquo; to describe the entire thing.)</p>

<p>Parallel to that track is marked in purple.  The purple dotted piece has just been cut by the green guy, who is about to cut where the purple line crosses the piece.</p>

<p>On either outer edge, light blue and light green lines mark the tracks so far.</p>

<p>The white guy with green head is about to pick up sticks to have them cut and cross the end of the black track with the purple track.</p>

<p>Yellow guy with green backpack is going to take the cut pieces and place them as berms on the lower right 180 degree turn.  Pink and white guys are going to place the piece Pink is holding; it will be the second piece to cross over another track.</p>

<p>But first, I&rsquo;m going to the iOS meetup in Shiboooyah!</p>

<p><strong>10:46pm Friday 17 May 2013</strong></p>

<p>I had been using <a href="https://cyberduck.ch">Cyberduck</a>, but it has to update the entire huge file each time so takes too long and cannot recover from network errors.</p>

<p>I found and even installed <a href="https://www.expandrive.com/">expandrive</a> but it&rsquo;s not free, so I kept looking</p>

<p>I looked at <a href="https://code.google.com/p/boar/">boar</a> which would probably do just fine, but I did a couple more searches</p>

<p>I found <a href="https://caca.zoy.org/wiki/git-bigfiles">git-bigfiles</a> which would probably also do fine,</p>

<p>Then I found a quite recent article with several of my preferred keywords: <a href="https://dreamhost.com/dreamscape/2013/02/11/backing-up-to-dreamobjects-with-duplicity/">Backing up to DreamObjects with Duplicity</a></p>

<p>Everything went pretty smoothly with a couple caveats.  Note: the following isn&rsquo;t meant to be a tutorial so much as a reminder to myself how I installed Duplicity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p> brew install librsync python gpg ncftp</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this failed until I ran</p>

<blockquote>
<p>brew update</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now back on track, but you should use <a href="https://duplicity.nongnu.org/">latest version of Duplicity</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p> tar xvzf duplicity-0.6.21.tar.gz</p>

<p> pip install boto httplib2 oauth</p>

<p> cd duplicity-0.6.21</p>

<p> sudo python setup.py install</p>
</blockquote>

<p>duplicity spooked me at first when it responded with this:</p>

<pre><code>Local and Remote metadata are synchronized, no sync needed.
Last full backup date: none

<p>I was like &ldquo;gah! it didn&rsquo;t backup!!!&rdquo; but just give it some time(*) it should work.</p>

<p>(*) it took less time than for me to find another possible candidate: <a href="https://s3tools.org/s3cmd">s3cmd</a></p>

<p><strong>7:54am Friday 17 May 2013</strong></p>

<p>Just as the green guy was going to cut a stick for yellow backpack guy, another guy&rsquo;s stick moved into the way and was lopped off. I&rsquo;m headed to work now while green guy is in the middle of an apology shrug.</p>
