<p>Koko took the same elevator as me yesterday; I hadn&rsquo;t seen her in a couple weeks, so I was like, &ldquo;HI!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turns out she takes the same train line as me, so we walked to the station together. Her parents are in town to see their first grandbaby. Happy times!</p>

<p>##09:14 Thursday 26 July 2012</p>

<p>This may just be some nicely written copy, but I have a feeling that Meteor will be a game changer for the web.</p>

<p>================================================</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re happy to announce that we&rsquo;ve arranged $11.2 million in funding
for Meteor&rsquo;s continued development. The money is now sitting in the
bank account of Meteor Development Group, a company controlled by the
project founders.</p>

<p>$11.2 million is a lot of money. What it gives us is certainty. No
matter what else happens in the world, the core team will be able to
focus entirely on Meteor for several years, without taking on
consulting work or trying to create some other application on top of
Meteor to sell. The high valuation of the round eliminates any
possiblity of a talent acquisition. And we control the company&rsquo;s
board. So, everyone in the community can be certain that Meteor will
be around for the long haul.</p>

<p>Our agenda for the next few years is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Make Meteor the best platform for writing most any kind of
app. This is an enormous job and will continue to consume almost all
of our energy. Our goal is ubiquity on the scale of SQL, Apache, or
Java.</p></li>

<li><p>Create opportunities for Meteor developers &ndash; for example,
encourage companies to adopt Meteor, creating jobs. We want to make
you famous and get you paid.</p></li>

<li><p>Support the Meteor community. This includes everything from
publishing books and organizing conferences, to being responsive to
bug reports and pull requests, to finally making some cool tshirts.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Meteor will always be free and open-source. Eventually, we plan to
make a commercial product too, called Galaxy. Galaxy will be a product
that the operations department at a large company might buy. It&rsquo;ll be
an enterprise-grade, multi-tenant hosting environment for Meteor
apps. In other words, it&rsquo;ll let you run a private, centrally
controlled &ldquo;meteor deploy&rdquo;-like service for your company, on your own
hardware. You&rsquo;ll be able to manage how your apps are distributed
across your datacenters, perform capacity planning, and enforce
controls and policies that are appropriate to your
organization. Google and Facebook have these tools &ndash; why shouldn&rsquo;t
your organization? If your company is not large enough to have an
operations department, it&rsquo;s unlikely that you&rsquo;d want to buy Galaxy.</p>

<p>Galaxy is a long distance in the future. For now, the only focus is Meteor.</p>

<p>With this money comes a lot of responsibility. When we started this
project, we took on two jobs &ndash; building a great application platform,
and building a fun, welcoming, and supportive community around it. Now
we&rsquo;re taking on a third job, building a world-class company. This is
not an easy job, and we already have our hands full with jobs one and
two. Fortunately we&rsquo;ve recruited some excellent help.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Top VC fund Andreessen Horowitz is putting up most of the money. We
chose AH because everyone we met at AH was staggeringly intelligent,
and many of them have built highly impactful companies such as
Netscape. AH also has strong name recognition among CTO&rsquo;s and CIO&rsquo;s,
which will make it easier to sell your boss on Meteor.</p></li>

<li><p>Meteor&rsquo;s partner at AH is Peter Levine. As former CEO of XenSource,
he is an expert at selling open source into the enterprise. AH has
kindly allowed their board seat to be occupied by Rod Johnson, who
created the open source Spring framework and built a successful
company (SpringSource) around it. And we also found a way to involve
David Skok at Matrix Ventures, who built the enterprise sales
strategy for JBoss, the open-source application server. Peter, Rod,
and David are our dream team and we&rsquo;re very fortunate to have gotten
them all into the same room.</p></li>

<li><p>The wise and patient counsel of James Lindenbaum (Heroku) has
already been invaluable. Besides James, other individual investors
include Dustin Moskovitz (Facebook/Asana), Alexis Ohanian (Reddit),
Paul Buchheit (Gmail), Maynard Webb, Ron Conway, and others.</p></li>

<li><p>Meteor was also a stealth participant in the S11 cycle of Y Combinator.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Deals like these have a lot of moving parts and take a long time to
close. It&rsquo;s a relief to make this announcement and get back to
coding. We&rsquo;ll have more news over the coming weeks.</p>

<p>I have SSD (512GB) and 16GB RAM on my new MacBook Pro, but still, Finder seems to take its sweet time to do some things. Why??</p>

<p>Also, why does Xcode suck so much? It&rsquo;s seems completely buggy, especially compared to other Mac applications.</p>

<p>Moe and Joe are the names of two race horses in a long joke I used to tell in YRUU. It includes the line &ldquo;moe joe moe joe moe joe moe joe moe joe&rdquo; several times in the joke.</p>

<p>I think Lin and I used &ldquo;moe, joe, moe, joe&rdquo; as a sort of chant while hiking up Mt Fuji, and it came to mean something was challenging or disliked.</p>

<p>Well, I like programming, but I dislike having to keep it all on this side of the server! I&rsquo;ve got some fun (?) boxes that I can click and they talk to the database and create more boxes, and then click again and delete said boxes, all with the magic of jquery and css. But, I can&rsquo;t show you. Moe Joe.</p>

<p>This is for my AB client who we were going to meet today, but they cancelled. We&rsquo;ll try again next week.</p>

<p>Speaking of AB, yesterday I got a RUSH ticket from them saying they couldn&rsquo;t save some data in the DB. It was weird because I could see the data had been saved (to the change log), but sure enough it wasn&rsquo;t being displayed on the screen (because it wasn&rsquo;t in the DB).</p>

<p>The good news: I tried it on our test server and had the same problem. Yes! I opened up the data class that saves to the DB and looked for all the instances of the table to which it&rsquo;s supposed to be saved. All looked fine.</p>

<p>Then I just happened to notice my mistake, and it was due to a hack I had implemented last week. Fortunately it was an easy fix, and I moved the corrected file to the live server.</p>

<p>The broken code had been broken for a week, so I consulted the logs to see what damage had been done. 49 records had been edited.  Hmmm. I checked a bit more and found only 13 of them had the subrecords anyway, so only 13 lost their subrecords. Whew!! not too terrible! Instead of trying some magical SQL query to fix them all, I just went through them by hand and re-did the edits to re-add the subrecords.</p>

<p>That was last night, and fortunately it wasn&rsquo;t too bad so only made me 20 minutes late going home.</p>

<p>This morning I prepared a report and got it ready to print with our other stuff for the meeting.. and meeting cancelled. Awesome! I ddn&rsquo;t have to put on shoes!</p>

<p>Today is approximately my 90th consecutive shoeless day in Tokyo.</p>

<p>HI Apple</p>

<p>I was looking forward to getting support on my new MBP, but when I tried to log in to one-to-one on Firefox, I get the message that I must use Safari.</p>

<p>Is there a workaround for this?  Is Apple only targeting Firefox?  I can open the same link in Chrome, but how long until you block Chrome as well?</p>

<p>It seems like Apple is trying to boost Safari market share with some freedom-revoking business practice.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers</a></p>

<p>I feel really sad to have to cancel, but I think it&rsquo;s the only way I can get Apple&rsquo;s attention.  Can you please pass along the message?</p>

<p>best regards</p>

<ul>
<li>Rob</li>

<hr />

<p>I sent the above message to my contact at the Apple Store in Shibuya. After reading the pros and cons of one-to-one membership, I had been sold on the idea that I could get an outstanding amount of help in a year for just $99. The message was basically sitting down with an <em>expert</em> on OS X would be invaluable. Even just a single session to help get my new Mac tweaked would be worth the price. Fair enough; I tacked on 9500 yen to my ~300,000 yen purchase. One-to-one for a small fraction of the overall price; why not?</p>

<p>I routinely switch between Chrome and Firefox in my web browsing and web development. I have Safari (and Rockmelt, and Flock) in my Dock, but I don&rsquo;t ever open them; I don&rsquo;t remember the details, but they didn&rsquo;t suit me for one reason or another.</p>

<p>Being forced to use Safari will not make me happy to use it.</p>

<hr />

<p>When Windows 98 came out, I said &ldquo;screw this&rdquo; and switched to Red Hat linux. I never got into it enough to figure out how to upgrade the kernel, so when OS X came out, I switched to Mac and was quite happy with my choice.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m getting to a &ldquo;screw this&rdquo; mentality with Apple now. I think I&rsquo;ll be looking at ubuntu next.</p>

<li><p>I really appreciate that posterous makes it easy to post text and images to my wordpress installation on my website robnugen.com, and my accounts on facebook.com, posterous.com, plus a link on twitter.<br />
But I don&rsquo;t really like not have tighter control of the HTML/CSS used to create entries.</p></li>

<li><p>Lin and I have been married for a year and 8 days. It&rsquo;s been quite lovely, and opposite one of the comics at the recent Mad Cows Comedy at The Pink Cow (which is moving to Roppongi soon), I <em>do</em> wake up each morning going, &ldquo;yes!! I married Lin!&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>No kids on the radar, but there have been discussions and a certain lack of protection in that arena. In my dream I heard &ldquo;first ejaculation is conception,&rdquo; which I don&rsquo;t know how well was translated on the way to my brain, but that&rsquo;s what I heard.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;m at work at sbstrm, now on my third year-contract over a four year period.</p></li>

<li><p>Francois, having had a shower and a couple years of adventures, is back on my desk.</p></li>

<li><p>My new MacBook Pro will arrive next week! It&rsquo;s got 16GB of RAM, 512GB of SSD (my first SSD machine (<em>)), plus the latest CPU and screen (&ldquo;retina display&rdquo;).<br />
(</em>) Fred says it will be by far the largest jump in speed I&rsquo;ve ever gotten by upgrading my computer.</p></li>

<li><p>We had a decent little shakey earthquake last week, but it&rsquo;s forgettable in the larger scale (as are all things; hmmm)</p></li>

<li><p>My dad called me on skype from his iPhone. That&rsquo;s cool, and it&rsquo;s even cooler that he was out and about (I assume not near a wifi connection). What&rsquo;s not cool is that he was driving at the time! DAaaaaAADD!!</p></li>

<li><p>Tariq and I are working on the app yomikakieigo (read and write English); our first attempt at releasing it in the app store was rejected for it being &ldquo;primarily a video&rdquo; If by &ldquo;a video&rdquo; they meant &ldquo;11 videos,&rdquo; I can understand. Anyway, we&rsquo;re making a sorta-game out of it with the videos as unlockable rewards. I&rsquo;m sure that will allay any concerns that it&rsquo;s primarily a video.</p></li>

<li><p>We&rsquo;re also working on an app that uses Cocos2D. I think it will be fun even though it won&rsquo;t have any videos.</p></li>

<li><p>I put together some code that will essentially do what CakePHP&rsquo;s framework functionality does: read the DB table info and make the basic code to read and write records from the DB. It even includes some ajax to prevent creating same-named records.</p></li>

<li><p>Recently been working on a popup window that talks to the datatables table in the main window, allowing filtering on any field in the primary and a secondary table. haven&rsquo;t added the second secondary table or the two tertiary tables, but that&rsquo;s all coming.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve been reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0057DBFQI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0057DBFQI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=keepusthelim-20"><em>The Hiram Key</em></a><img src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=keepusthelim-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0057DBFQI" alt="" /> by Christopher Knight and Robert Lomas. It&rsquo;s pretty interesting to look at what more likely happened back in the day of Jesus (and back in the day before that). I had already heard that Christianity was made mainstream by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea">Council of Nicaea</a>, but this gives even more detail.</p></li>

<p>Emergency brakes activated during our acceleration out of Gotanda on Yamanote Line.  I watched about 10 people stumble toward the front of the train&hellip;.  Glad I was holding on (with my shoulder leaning against the doorframe), but it&rsquo;s very rare that I&rsquo;m not ready for such a stop.</p>

<p>Josh and Amy are two of Lin&rsquo;s friends from work; they started around the same time as she did, so they&rsquo;re all mates. We all went to The Pink Cow last night, for Josh&rsquo;s and Amy&rsquo;s first and first visits, respectfully.</p>

<p>It was Body Works Night, featuring live painting, live body painting, about eight belly dancers, three Cuban dancers, and live music.</p>

<p>The Cuban dancing was new to me, and the most interesting, with bright blue and bright burnt orange flowy puffy dresses, plus a guy half naked and sweeping the air and his back with a broom made of thin sticks.</p>

<p>Delicious burritos and goldrush brownies and extra ice cream. Great to see Traci, and excited to hear that The Pink Cow is moving to Roppongi soonishly! They&rsquo;ll certainly get more walk-in traffic who will enjoy the delights of The Pink Cow!!!</p>
