                        <p class=date>10:30pm Wednesday 3 March 1999</p>

<p><p>Today I did laundry and got my hand written diary caught up since New Hampshire while watching the clothes tumble in the dryers.</p>

<p><p>Dude and I met with Desmond and Thomas, working out details on how we can share abilities and resources; Desmond does telephone stuff, Thomas is great with PC hardware and MS certified, and Dude and I do website stuff.  We plan to sell our services in one seamless package to businesses who need computer stuff.</p>

<p><p>Tomorrow Dude and I are going to Beaumont (hi Cathy!) and will help install some cable (telephone and data lines) in a new auto dealership building. Cool. It&rsquo;s nice to occasionally change the type of work we do from web design to something else.</p>

<p><p>After the meeting, Dude and I took his and his wife&rsquo;s mountain bikes, and his dog Bailey, and went mountain biking down at Memorial Park.  We rode through trails and trails and trails that wind through trees and up and down small valleys or creeks or rivulets or something.</p>

<blockquote><em><p>This is the same set of trails I rode with my downstairs neighbor Stefan (or was it his brother whose name I have forgotten?) a long time ago and came back with 4 cracked knuckles.  Stefan (or his brother) said, "you wanna go on the easy trails or the big trails?" and I was all, "let's start big!"

<p>Suddenly we were at the top of the Ho Chi Minh trail (I think that's what they called it and how it's spelled) and he zipped down then up and turned and down and perfectly stopped at the bottom. 
<br>I zipped down then up then did not turn and BLAM my hand, tightly gripping the bike handle, crushed into a tree and I flipped over the front of the bike.  Ow.

<p>I kept riding, though my hand pretty much could not grip the grip anymore. Ironically, we were on flat ground and I hit something sharp, puncturing one of the tires and we had to walk the bikes back to his truck.

<p>On my left hand I had fractured the lower knuckle on my index finger, the lower and middle knuckle on my middle finger, and the middle knuckle on my ring finger.  Wore a cast for 6 weeks and haven't ridden a mountain bike since.

<p>(But I have ridden a racing bike since, and ended up crashing into a chain link fence and getting like 25 stitches in my face and ear, but that's a different story (and it's all true))
</em></blockquote>

<p><p>Today was different. I had quite a delightful amount of fear as I approached each of the valleys. Dude would zip right down and back up the other side; I would stop and contemplate. Hmmmm. Fear would tense my stomach and heart. Holy cow no way and I enjoyed the fear emotion in me.</p>

<p><p>I eventually went down each hill we reached, and one time (maybe twice) made it back up the other side without getting off the bike. One time I wrecked into a tree, but this accident did not involve a hill. We were quickly navigating some turns and I didn&rsquo;t quite make it and BLAM my right forearm scraped pretty harshly against a tree. I flipped kinda across the bike but was okay. I was wearing my helmet.</p>

<p><p>I survived. I didn&rsquo;t end up in the emergency room. I find it intriguing that if we had been on skates, I would have easily negotiated all the turns and hills (assuming they would be paved instead of dirt and roots and stuff).</p>

<p><p>To Fuddruckers we ate with Wende&rsquo;s and my youth group. We marveled at the new Delaware quarters and told jokes and stuff. David asked me to say HI to him on the radio tomorrow; I can&rsquo;t mention his name, but I do plan to say something at 6:30am.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;This song is for everyone who is trying to wake up now,&rdquo; and I&rsquo;ll play a rockin&rsquo; obnoxious song; maybe by Beastie Boys back when they were punk.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ll be on the radio in 5.25 hours!!  Gotta go to sleep.</p>

<p><p>Listen on the web at <a href="https://www.ktru.org">www.ktru.org</a>. I&rsquo;m on 4-7am Thursdays (Central time).</p>

<p><p>Technology is pretty amazin&rsquo;.  Dude and I have been chatting over ICQ and working on a new website.  Free of charge (given the computer and phone line) we have used a <a href="https://www.geocities.com">geocities</a> website for 11 megs of space, an <a href="https://www.iname.com">iname</a> email address, and a <a href="https://www.listbot.com">listbot</a> email list for this new website (for a non profit organization that can&rsquo;t really afford anything).</p>

<p><p>But I&rsquo;m just marveling that all this is like <em>free</em> and just <b>out there</b> to be used, and I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s tons more that we simply haven&rsquo;t seen yet.</p>

<p><p>Plus, chatting over <a href="https://www.icq.com">ICQ</a> our two apartments, which are physically 2+ miles apart, are suddenly virtually side by side in the MR Laboratories virtual office.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m going to actually go outside now and help Wende move.</p>

<p class=date>9:26am Sunday 28 February 1999</p>

<p>Jen is driving me back to the airport after a wonderful wonderful week. We really bonded in a delightful loving platonic way. Stayed up this morning until 5am and got up 1 hour ago after sleeping side by side in her bed.

<p>the gound is mostly dry - temperature about 40+ degrees - a few patches of snow sill hide in shaded areas. Beautiful countryside reminds me of West Virginia.  I almost said west Texas, but here there are no cacti, and mostly the trees are birch, but few oaks.

<p>Just took a picture of MOOSE CROSSING sign.

<p>9:57am just parked at airport.

<p><hr width="20%" align="left">

<p class=date>10:35am Sunday 28 February 1999</p>

<p>Big props and big hugs to Jen as we hung out talking before my flight. Saw a man pulling a wheeled luggage thing and his little 3 or 4 year old boy hugging the bag, thereby riding it as it rolled down the hall.  I didn't get a picture of that, but I got one of him riding it like a horse.

<p><hr width="20%" align="left">

<p class=date>12:30pm Sunday 28 February 1999</p>

<p>Met a woman named Grey on the plane, and we talked about our lives and the SUN end-of-Millenium predictions. She's a mom and loves LEGOs and has a full sized arcade game in her house; she's the most popular mom on the block.

<p>I'm leaving Baltimore airport now after Grey got off.  I never got off the plane at this stop, but I did switch seats up to the front six.  Three of us are sharing the seats, Richard (who is reading through a rather thick pile of resumes to find a President of something at a University in Cairo (maybe president of the university; I don't know), Catherine (who is reading People magazine, and I (writing in my diary and about to take a nap)

<p><hr width="20%" align="left">

<p class=date>2:20pm Sunday 28 February 1999</p>

<p>I game up my seat after I got on a new plane in Nashville, Tennessee. I had called Wende from the airport, confirmed the time for her to picke me up, went on a search for ice cream (unsuccessful), boarded the plane, talked to a man who lives in Brownsville for the summer (otherwise Minnesota), and then jumped out of my seat when the flight attendant said essentially, "we are overbooked and need 4 volunteers; we will offer one hundred dollars, and will get you on the next flight which will arrive in Houston at 4:45pm."

<p>4:45 is only 50 minutes after this flight was supposed to arrive, so I volunteered and got a flight voucher for $247 (price of the flight I had just given up plus $100) and a free seat on the next flight!!!!  Totally awesome!  I see it as I just got paid more than $100/hour for 50 minutes of my time. Cool.

<p>So I called Wende who said, "ROB. I am so excited for you, but don't do it again."  (We have to be at church at 6pm today for a youth coffee house thing where all the parents are invited to buy tickets and eat spaghetti and watch the show)

<p>"I won't do it again today; I promise," I said and we confirmed that she'll pick me up at 5pm.

<p>I went on a search for ice cream and came back with frozen yogurt. Close enough. 

<p>Walking back toward the gate, I heard "Rob!"

<p>???? Who knows me here in Nashville??

<p>It was Kim, the SWA CSR* who told me in her cute country Dolly Parton accent "here's yore boarding pass for yore flight; I told you I'd get it for you."

<p>"Thank you," I said with a smile, (I was very entertained by her accent) "I never once doubted you."

<p>"Boy that sure looks good," she said, eyeing my frozen yogurt.

<p>"Would you like a bite?"

<p>"I'm talkin' about the whole thing."

<p>I offered to get her one (assuming she would decline, knowing I wouldn't have time to get one anyway; it was a long walk plus I had to exit the secured area and go back through the security check-in) and she declined.

<p>So now I am sitting by the gate for this flight that leaves in about 10 minutes.

<p>Holy cow. I just found out that this flight was delayed from 11:30am to 2:30pm. Thank you, angels, for allowing me the $100 and free flights and frozen yogurt and and all the good wonderful stuff in my life.  I love my life and all the ways it beatifully unfolds before me.

<p><hr width="20%" align="left">

<p class=date>2:50pm</p>

<p><p>Oh my goodness this is even more wonderful. I got on the plane, nearly the last person on, but I got the very front seat. I&rsquo;m sitting across from a sleeping man who is part of the <a href="https://www.nwba.org">NWBA</a> (National Wheelchair Basketball Association). Several members of the team are in these front 24 or 30 seats. The sleeping man across from me has lost his legs and has serious scars on his arms and face; he&rsquo;s lost most of the fingers on his left hand.</p>

<p><p>The team was pretty much being silly; talking and telling stories and stuff.. I joked with them when I could. Their team doesn&rsquo;t have an individual site, but I offered to build one for them if they ever want.</p>

<p><p><hr width="20%" align="left"></p>

<p><p><font size="+1" face="arial">4:56pm</font></p>

<p><p>I was first off the plane and my luggage was perfectly waiting for me after it arrived on the previous flight. Thank you angels for a wonderful trip.</p>

<p><p>With Love
<br>- Rob</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Tonight&rdquo; Jen and I went to Packers Falls, a waterfall area on the Lamprey river a few miles from her house. We literally just sat on the brilliant white snow, listening to the white noise gussshhhhhh of water falling over the rocks.</p>

<p><p>It was pretty cold, but I was wearing 2 pairs of socks, shoes, undies, shorts, two pairs of sweat pants, t-shirt, sweat shirt, knit hat, hoodie, big winter coat and gloves. We were also sitting on a blanket and coat spread onto the ground.</p>

<p><p>We went in after like 30 minutes of meditative silence; Jen had gotten cold since she was wearing only like pants, socks, shoes, sweat shirt, jacket, hat, gloves.</p>

<p><p>Got back to her house like at 4am and showed her roommmate Ray (short for Rachael) pictures from Costa Rica.  She had just gotten home a few hours earlier, my first time to meet her and we talked but hadn&rsquo;t looked at pictures yet.  Ray lived in Costa Rica for a while and showed me lots of her pictures too.</p>

<p><p>I gotta be awake in a few hours to panic pack and leave.</p>

                        <p class=date>7:55pm Saturday 27 February 1999</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m in Boston at Marje&rsquo;s house, where she and Jen are playing a &ldquo;sexy flute duet&rdquo; for me. Jen and I went to the museum of natural science today and looked at lots of cool stuff including a big billiard ball track including a random splitter (the ball would fall onto a spinning plate and be randomly sent in one of four directions.</p>

<p><p>There was a rad display on the wall, like a huge collage but it was all white unless viewed through polarized filters.  So they had a slowly spinning filter some 50 feet away that made the collage seem to slowly oscillate through colors and stuff, making some portions visible, some blacked-out, some whited-out.. it was crazy cool and I wish I had taken some pics! (Maybe I&rsquo;ll surf and find some..  okay, here is a link to what they call the <a href="https://www.mos.org/tour/maptour4.html">Polage (polarized collage)</a>.  This was linked without permission from the <a href="https://www.mos.org">Boston Museum of Science</a>.)
<br>That image gives a hint of what it is like.  To the bottom right of the picture in the foreground are the slowly spinning filters I described above.</p>

<p><p>We saw a SETI movie in the planetarium, which was fun and mildly educational for me.  I learned the location of the constellation Taurus, and something else I forgot.</p>

<p><p>We saw the movie &ldquo;Thrill Ride&rdquo; in their huge Omnimax <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> sphere huge domed screen.. It featured some roller coasters and general thrill ride technology. Embarassingly enough (considering I had laughed at the idea of queasiness), I felt a bit nauseous after the show, but I think that feeling was enhanced by me having only eaten a single blueberry muffin and orange juice that day some hours earlier.</p>

<p><p>Saw a super duper way way cool electricity show, featuring 4 tesla coils, and two HUGE enormous van de graff generators - the largest in the world (?) that produce 2.5 million volts together.  I took several pics of that show; we&rsquo;ll see how they come out.</p>

<p><p>Road the &ldquo;T&rdquo; (their mass transit train) to and from the museum and ate pizza at some pizza place. I ordered it and  had a vague thought of, &ldquo;hmmm $9 is kinda expensive for a personal pizza&rdquo; but it turns out it was a huge full sized pizza and I only ate 1 slice and carried the rest back in a big full sized pizza box&hellip;  So I had a big pizza on the train and I felt a bit conspicuous. I appear to have survived the ordeal. ;-)</p>

                        <p class=date>12:52am Friday 26 February 1999</p>

<p><p>On the way to Jen&rsquo;s mom&rsquo;s house, we stopped by a grocery store to grab a few items and my attention was grabbed by the headline on the SUN: <font face="arial">MILLENIUM PREDICTIONS</font>.  I scanned the cover of this tabloid and would have ignored it except for &ldquo;Exact date of Judegement Day &ndash; Are you prepared?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Hmmm. Jen bought it and it says (among other things)</p>

<p><p><blockquote>Christ returns on July 4, 2003 - Judgement Day - ushering in a new Golden Age of peace and prosperity.
<br><font size="-1">March 2, 1999 &ndash; SUN &ndash; page 23</font>
</blockquote></p>

<p><p>There were a lot of interesting predictions, including exact dates in the beginning of 2000.  I&rsquo;ll probably put them in here later.</p>

<p><p>ANYway, to her mom&rsquo;s house where we got a bigger coat for me which was oh so warm and it was snowing!! A few inches on the ground and flakes gently blowing down. We walked out behind their house and took a few pics including me making a snow angel.</p>

<p><p>Drove to Boston and it began to snow more. Parked in a garage (pahk the cah in the gahrahge) and walked around a bit - found a restroom in a mall and then ate at Shanghai Cafe and then went to Blue Man Group.</p>

<p><p><hr width="20%"></p>

<p><p>The theater (Charles Playhouse) was small - about 300 seats but Blue Man Group has sold out 7 shows per week for over 6 years now.</p>

<p><p>As we sat watching people come in (we were the first ones in the theater) they had announcements scrolling across a marquee, something like:</p>

<pre>

      REMEMBER THAT FLASH PHOTOGRAPHY IS DISTRACTING SO PLEASE 
      PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT TAKE ANY PICTURES DURING THE SHOW.

      VIDEO TAPE THE SHOW OR WE WILL HAVE TO USE THE EJECTOR BUTTON

</pre>

<p>As the show began, the announcements changed to something like</p>

<pre>

</pre>

<p><p>I stood up even before it asked and in between hugging Jen and basking in the love and limelight I didn&rsquo;t get to read the whole thing exactly, but it was great!!! I felt super-loved for sure! Thank you thank you thank you Jen!!!!!</p>

<p><p>The next one was funny:</p>

<pre>
      IT IS ALSO SYLVIA BROOK'S BIRTHDAY.

      LET US ALL SPEAK HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO SYLVIA.

      DO NOT SING IT. NO ONE WANTS TO HEAR YOU SING.  READY GO.

      IN THE SECOND ROW.
</pre>

<p><p>A spotlight shown down upon his seat only.</p>

<pre>
      JUST KIDDING.
</pre>

<p><p>And that was just the marquee announcements.</p>

<p><p><font size="+1" face="arial"><a href="https://www.blueman.com">Blue Man Group</a></font> starred 3 men with blue latex entirely covering their heads and they did all kinds of beautifully choreographed wacky stuff. As the show started, the men were drumming and we could only see their silouhettes through three different faux windows. A light would shine behind the particular man that was drumming at the moment. After a bit, the third man was drumming and sprouted a third hand so he could drink some water at the same time.</p>

<p><p>The show had begun.</p>

<p><p>The place went dark and the windows removed and the lights came on and there were three blue men upstage on a platform (actually their heads and hands were blue and they were wearing black suits) two with arms crossed as the one in the middle drummed.</p>

<p><p>As the middle man drummed, the man on the left poured red paint onto the drum, which erupted into a spray of glowing red speckles straight up splatteringly through the air.  The man on the right poured yellow paint on his drum and it was just beautiful heavy drumming and paint splashing yellow red and purple crazy everywhere.</p>

<p><p>During this whole time, though the audience was cracking up laughing and cheering, the three blue men never once cracked a smile. In fact they never spoke or made any expressions with their mouths the entire show. They only explored their world with quizzical awareness.</p>

<p><p>After the splashy drumming, they came to the center of the stage, where there was a big gumball machine thing, and a bag of large marshmallows. With much deliberation and curiosity, the men approached the bag and machine, carefully inspecting them. One man opened the marshmallow bag and ate a marshmallow. His eyes widened with delight, &ldquo;yummm!&rdquo; He grabbed another one and threw it out into the audience. Soon all three men were tossing marshmallows essentially randomly into the audience. I did not catch one.</p>

<p><p>Then one of the blue men went to one end of the stage and had a pink gumball tossed to him. He caught it in his mouth, picked up a canvas, and sprayed pink paint across the canvas!</p>

<p><p>The other man went to the other side of the stage, and had a marshmallow tossed to him. He caught it in his mouth, picked up the canvas, and nothing. With a quizzical look he turned to the other men, who looked at him expectantly.</p>

<p><p>They stared.</p>

<p><p>The first man triumphantly grabbed the marshmallow from his mouth and stuck it firmly to the center of the canvas. &ldquo;Fair enough&rdquo; the first men apparently thought. A yellow gumball was tossed, and yellow paint sprayed on the canvas.</p>

<p><p>A marshmallow was thrown to the other man, who simply caught it in his mouth. Another was thrown. Another. Another. Another. I lost count. Another. Another. Another. At least 10 marshmallows and he caught every one.</p>

<p><p>Blue paint to the first man who spun the canvas and painted a bright blue spiral on it.</p>

<p><p>Ten more marshmallows to the first man, who hadn&rsquo;t taken out the first ten. Oh my god I could hardly believe it. He had to use his fingers to cram them in each time and he never dropped one.</p>

<p><p>He grabbed his canvas, and slowly slowly spewed out a gooey pile of all 20 marshmallows into a tall tower of white blubbery bluh. He whipped out a sign that said &ldquo;$4000&rdquo; and hung it in front of his creation, gesturing triumphantly, &ldquo;you think that painting is something; look what I made!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p><hr width="20%"></p>

<p><p>At one point, the men began to creep slowly into the audience, one man stepping literally from the stage onto the backs of chairs, gently placing his hands on the heads of audience members for balance. One man walked right in front of our row, inspecting each memeber. As he was looking straight into my eyes, I licked my lips in a sexually seductive manner. He didn&rsquo;t flinch or blink or smile or nothin&rsquo;.  Wow.</p>

<p><p>They found a young woman with dark hair, and gently escorted her to the stage, and placed a blue breastplate on her, kinda like a dress, and one man pulled out a small portable stereo from under the table behind which they were all sitting.</p>

<p><p>He put it on the table and pressed play. They all looked at her expectantly, as if to see how she would react. She was totally like trying to do the right thing but had no idea what exactly the right thing might be. She smiled as &ldquo;I am the antichrist&rdquo; played through the stereo. The three men began to bob their heads side to side to the music. The man beside her looked at her like, &ldquo;why aren&rsquo;t you bobbing your head?&rdquo; until she did and they stopped immediately and watched her.</p>

<p><p>She stopped, sheepishly smiled and shrugged. The first man stopped the CD and yanked the stereo back under the table.</p>

<p><p>The second man got out flowers and placed them carefully in front of the woman to see how she would react. The audience went, &ldquo;awwwwwwwww&rdquo; and all three men stared wide eyed into the audience, like, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you see we are busy??&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>The third man put up the painting of a woman in a field and hung it behind the woman. Bolero began to play on the sound system.</p>

<p><p>Then the second man pulled out a candle shaped light for her to turn on. They looked at her expectantly until she turned it on. The switch was spring loaded to turn off unless she was holding it on.  She shrugged as it went off and the second man pulled the candle off the table.</p>

<p><p>Then a man pulled out a desk lamp placed right over the flowers, and simply clapped twice to turn it on.</p>

<p><p>Jen started the audience in a small clapping frenzy, causing the light to blink, so the man yanked it off the table as well.</p>

<p><p>Then a jello-ish blob was pulled out by the first man, who wiggled it, and they all looked expectantly at the woman to see how she would react. Nothing much was her reaction, so the second guy began to wiggle the flowers at her. Nothing again, so the third man wiggled the painting to see how she would react.</p>

<p><p>Nothing.</p>

<p><p>So the first guy wiggled the jello and <b><em>BANG</em></b> the table was spring loaded and launched the jello blob fully 40 feet into the audience where an audience member caught it perfectly.</p>

<p><p>With the jello launched, the third man grabbed the flowers to put them on the launching pad, but the second man immediately grabbed them away. The first man then pulled out a large electric bug zapper, and hung it on a peg near his head.</p>

<p><p>Then the twinkies.</p>

<p><p>One man pulled out a box of generic twinkies, and gave one to each person at the table. The three men began to wiggle and twist the plastic, but couldn&rsquo;t get them open. The girl opened hers with no problem. The man sitting beside her looked impressed, and held his twinkie out toward her.</p>

<p><p>She helped him open it, and he held it up and shook it tauntingly at the other two men.</p>

<p><p>The second man had her help him as well and then shook his twinkie tauntingly at the last man who hadn&rsquo;t opened his yet.</p>

<p><p>With a look of &ldquo;oh yeah?&rdquo; the last man grabbed an electric jigsaw, cut the twinkie in half, let the halves drop out of the plastic, held them back together, and wiggled the repaired twinkie at all of them.</p>

<p><p>From behind them, the second man grabbed a large vacuum hose and sucked up all the twinkie plastic, and one half of the last man&rsquo;s twinkie.</p>

<p><p>That man grabbed the hose and sucked up the second man&rsquo;s entire twinkie, and tried to suck up the girls twinkie, but the man beside her chivalrously protected it from harm.</p>

<p><p>So the man sucked the girl off the painting. Only the background was left.</p>

<p><p>The hose was tossed away in disgust; now there were 2.5 twinkies on the table and 3 men and 1 still-not-sure-what-to-do woman.</p>

<p><p>The man with <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> a twinkie cut off a tiny piece and gave it to the twinkie-less man.  The girl cut hers in half and gave the same man <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> of her twinkie. The first man took his tiny piece back.</p>

<p><p>The men grabbed knife and fork and began to gingerly cut the twinkies, noticed the woman was not, so stared at her until she did.</p>

<p><p>Once each had cut a piece of twinkie, with a grand flourish, the men each held their fork with arm outstretched ceremoniously in front of them. They waited for her to catch up, then all three ate the bite at once and she quickly followed.</p>

<p><p>This was repeated for a couple bites until the man beside her looked longingly at her piece with eyes that said, &ldquo;feed me. please.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>She did, and he fed her, as their arms linked romantically. The other two men did the same. Another arm-linked romantic switch-bite and then suddenly&hellip; disaster.</p>

<p><p>The man beside her held his gut and reeled back, then forward and sppllleeellbblbpbblbbbjblbpbjpbbbbpppptt oooey gooey smashed twinkie looking goo spurt from a nozzle in his chest and spluttered onto the table.  Another man immediately stabbed a blob with his fork, studied it briefly (to let the audience wince) then ate it.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;YUM!!&rdquo; was the expression as he blopped bloppy blub onto his plate and began to devour it. Another man took a bite and was equally delighted and began to splat blops of it onto each of their plates. The three men ate voraciously, but the girl would have nothing to do with it.</p>

<p><p>Suddenly she did have something to do as her breast plate spewed mushy gushy blubbery brown goo onto the table and a spew fest began with high speed squirty blechy hilarious splattery splats all over the table and stage and everywhere.</p>

<p><p>As her nozzle spewed, one man took a polaroid pic and another began to load up a typical chinese take-out box with spew.  They removed her blue dress plate thing and handed her the pic and doggie box and the audience cheered recklessly.</p>

<p><p><font size="-1">(I&rsquo;m not even halfway through the show)</font></p>

<p><p>There was oh-so-much more, including hugely stuffing their mouths with Cap&rsquo;n Crunch and synchronized chewing as the band made huge chewing noises for each man. A virtual drum cadence resulted until one man smeared a huge streak of cereal bits up his face and onto the top of his head.</p>

<p><p>The other two men stopped their crunching to look at him curiously. For several moments, nothing happened.</p>

<p><p>Then, one man gestured gently toward his own upper lip like, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got some food on your lip; might want to check it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>The cereal-coated man slowly lifted one hand and gently flicked a single piece off his face.</p>

<p><p>The other man gestured slightly toward his own chin, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a bit on your chin, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>The cereal-coated man carefully flicked a piece off his chin.</p>

<p><p>The other looked cautiously carefully and the huge sheet of cereal coating the man&rsquo;s face, then held up one hand and nodded like, &ldquo;perfect; you got it all.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>AND THEY NEVER ONCE LAUGHED!!!!!</p>

<p><p>There was oh so much more; go see the show.  It plays in Chicago, New York City, and Boston.</p>

<p><p><font size="+1" face="arial"><a href="https://www.blueman.com">Blue Man Group</a></font>.  It was a great show.</p>

<p class=date>7:25am Thursday 25 February 1999</p>

<p><p>Wow! It snowed a bit las night! Only a tiny sprinkle, but enough to dust the tops of the cars. The creek won&rsquo;t be frozen over clear now I bet.</p>

<p><p><hr width="20%" align="left"></p>

<p><p>Jen and I went down to the creek and slid around on the dusty ice. We cracked it in several places, but didn&rsquo;t get wet.  So silent and peaceful in the woods; I meditated to make myself lighter so as to not crack the ice, and then heavier to make it crack. It kinda worked.</p>

<p><p>Got back inside and Meagan called, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s going to be 10 or 12 inches of snow today!&rdquo;  Wow! I talked to her a bit and I&rsquo;m pretty excited about seeing snow.</p>

<p><p>Now it&rsquo;s 11:17am and I&rsquo;m caught up. Tonight we go to see Blue Man Group in Boston. We&rsquo;re making contingency plans in case we get stranded overnight by the snow there!</p>

<p class=date>11:24am Wednesday 24 February 1999</p>

<p>Today is Wende's birthday.

<p>I got up, checked email (around 100 messages) after helping Jen with dishes. Most of the email I get is crap; I will ponder how to correct this sometime.

<p class=date>12:20pm Wednesday 24 February 1999</p>

<p>Played on the ice of Jen's creek and threw big rocks at it. I probably could have walked on it before I cracked it. Went up and got the camera and took a pic of me sliding on the driveway.  Back down to the creek but my angels said, "naw" with a vision of me falling through the ice.  So we're driving to the ocean.

<p class=date>12:48pm</p>

<p>Just stopped at a bridge over river and "floppy ice" as Jen calls it for a few more pics.  Floppy ice is cool - it's tidal water that had frozen then the tide goes out and the ice slowly collapses onto the rocks below as the water leaves from underneath it.  The effect is like a huge perfectly broken sheet of glass over bumpy rocks.  Except the glass is not sharp and it's really cold.  (fun to throw too)

<p class=date>2:49pm</p>

<p>Drove through a hilly chilly forest and Jen pointed out Joe's bro's house, but no one was there that we noticed.  Continued along the curvy road and then *bing* we were at a beach! Parked, got out and *bing* there's Joe walking toward us!  Jen and Joe hugged big and I said HI and stuff. He had just been at The Chair, a popular place to chill.

<p>The beach was broad expansive sand with hella cold wind. Finally got to The Chair, which I was really impressed with how sweet it was... a beautiful chair shaped rock, like a natural jetty Lay-Z-Boy beside a bay. We sat there in the near silence, watching a bay of waves slowly wash to shore. So peaceful that I began to fall asleep and actually did- just curled up sideways and slept about 1/2 an hour. The rock conveniently blocked the otherwise biting cold wind.

<p>Walked back to Joe's and froze my nose and toes; actually we just walked back to the car, but it was pretty cold enough and drove to Joe's bro's and warmed up by the wood stove.  After I was sufficiently warm to brave the sub freezing arctic blizzard (well okay there was no snow, but it was about 20 degrees), Joe, Jen and I went to Portsmouth to eat at The Friendly Toast. 

<p>Funny: on the way there, Jen saw a pickup truck with wide tires and stuff and she was all, "that's a weird truck," and I'm all, "really?  it's perfectly normal in Houston."  We soon noticed it had Texas license plates, and upon closer inspection was purchased from a Houston dealer. :-)

<p class=date>7:16pm</p>

<p><p>Joe, Jen and I ate at The Friendly Toast, and it was super cool.  Crazy garage sale items decorated the entire place; no more than 4 or 6 identical items could be found in the restaurant, including plates, silverware, cups, everything!</p>

<p><P>Back at Jens&rsquo; house we played on the frozen creek, and I learned I had the good fortune to see clear ice.. normally it will freeze but be snow covered and therefore opaque.  But we were able to walk on it and see right through to the silent brown leaves at the bottom.  The ice was two inches thick at minimum (except where tree branches kept it from freezing at all) and water flowed beneath it.  There&rsquo;s a little waterfall thing as a result of some old old old concrete bridge built a hundred years ago. We took a couple of pictures.</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;re upstairs listening to some tunes and playing Cosmic Wimpout, a fun Yatzee-ish game.</p>

<p><p>Meagan came over and reminisced with Joe (the all used to be roommates in college) and actually ended up driving him back home as Jen was pretty much way too tired.</p>

<p><p>Crazy: Joe lives in Maine, but it&rsquo;s only 30 minutes to his house.</p>

<p class=date>8am Tuesday 23 February 1999</p>

<p>I'm standing in line to get on the plane at Hobby Airport. This morning I woke early, scramble-packed and went to Dude's to take a shower as I washed some clothes at his house. We got them washed but not dried so I have a trash bag of damp shorts and undies in my bag here.  (I haven't done laundry in a while)

<p>Drove FAST to the airport 80mph and I'm here in plenty of time

<pre>- - - - - -</pre>

<p>Now I'm on the plane and have *six* seats to myself. This flight is pretty empty.  I'm sitting in the backwards-facing seats at the exit aisle.

<p><hr width="20%" align="left">

<p>Midflight landed in Jackson, Mississippe.  Been talking to Alexis, a student at Jersey Village, en route to Washington DC for a youth convention thing. Her dad is flying with her and will chill at her uncle's apparently.

<p>Oh my goodness this flight is still way unfull and Alexis and I have this next of all six seats to ourselves, with our stuff spread everywhere.

<p><hr width="20%" align="left">

<p>this flight has been particularly thankfully quiet and calm. The clouds below appear smooooth flat white supporting a brilliant blue sky. Now it has become bumpy as we decend through the clouds just in time for me to get back to my seat after a quiet stroll to each end of the fueslage.  People are mostly sleeping or reading; one guy is sleeping silently with his mouth gaping open.  |o

<p><hr width="20%" align="left">

<p class=date>2:40pm Tuesday 23 February 1999</p>

<p>met Frank at LIDS, a cap store in Baltimore airport.  Talked about hats a bit and soon about music and raves and DJ and KTRU and he'll call me when he arrives in Houston this summer.

<p>He used to DJ from 1987 to 1993 I think and his homey lost all their records and turntables when he got evicted. Ouch. 6 years of collecting records gone.  Frank has wanted to DJ but not start over and he loves the old music that is hard to find now anyway.

<p><hr width="20%" align="left">

<p class=date>8:56pm Tuesday 23 February 1999</p>

<p><font size="+1">HUGE</font> big hug from Jen as I stepped off the plane.  Super nice because I haven't been hugged bigly at the airport for most of my trips ('cept coming back from Albuquerque).

<p>We've been talk talk talkin' actually she's been talking showing me stuff as we drive.

<p><hr width="20%" align="left">

<p class=date>10pm or so</p>

<p><p>We dropped my wet clothes off into the community dryer below Jen&rsquo;s apartment; actually she lives in a big big three story yellow house that has been converted into multiple apartments. It&rsquo;s really cool how the stairs up the back were just kinda built along the prexisting side; maybe I&rsquo;ll get some pictures.</p>

<p><p>We stopped by a frozen river (A FROZEN RIVER!!) and threw rocks at it and they bouncy bounce bounced making a cool Star Wars-ish tonk sound each time they bounced.  I threw a big rock (as big a rock as I could heave 20 feet) and it more like thunked instead of tonked, but still reverberated the ice.</p>

<p><p>Then at at Taste of India, I had Shahi Paneer (actually 3 of us (Jen, Tammy and I) had that, and Randy had something else), Lassi (yogurt drink mango flavor), peshwari nan (unlevened baked bread with raisins and coconut), gulab jamun (fried bread in syrup).  We had met Tammy and Randy there, but we were late after bouncing the rocks on the river.  :-)</p>

<p><p>I enjoyed watching our quirks: Tammy is picky and pampered, Randy quiet and accomodating, Jen with her robot phobia, and me being from Texas, we had plenty of fun conversation.</p>

<p><p>There is no sales tax in New Hampshire, no helmet law, and no seat belt law.</p>

<p><p>We have just rented Hardware to scare Jen with robot stuff (she wanted to see it!)</p>

<p><p class=date>12:50am Wednesday 24 February 1999</p> (Wende&rsquo;s birthday)</p>

<p><p>Watched Hardware at Meagan&rsquo;s house, and Jen enjoyed it, but said it wasn&rsquo;t as scary as some different movie she saw. Meagan was on the phone pretty much the whole time so didn&rsquo;t get to watch the movie like at all.</p>

<p><p>Looked at Meagan&rsquo;s photo album and exchanged travel stories - me about Costa Rica; Jen and Meagan about England, and Meagan about hot springs in Arizona.</p>

<p><p>Back to Jen&rsquo;s we looked at <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> of my Costa Rica pics, but were too tired to continue.</p>

<p><p>Good Night.</p>

<p><p>With Love
<br>- Rob</p>

<p><p>Yesterday Manda helped me clean my apartment before I hosted a Flashnet opportunity meeting yesterday evening.</p>

<p><p>Mostly she just inspired me to clean more; cheerleading always helps me. I threw away a lot of crap, and created places for a lot of previously homeless stuff. There are no computers strewn across my living room floor, the kitchen table is visible, and all my dirty clothes are actually in the hamper. Wow.</p>

<p><p>I had already washed the dishes and the cleaned bathroom.</p>

<p><p>Guess what?  I&rsquo;ll be at <a href="https://ktru.org">KTRU</a> in less than 1 hour.  I&rsquo;ll be on air in about 1 hour!!</p>

<p><p>Last night I chatted in <a href="https://wbs.net">WBS</a> in their Lounge C. Met Magic Fire, James something, ktemt, 1 Small Wonder, and ended up talking about Jesus and stuff. Discussion was kinda difficult for me since, by nature of a chat room, only short thoughts can be effectively spoken at a time.</p>

<p><p>I just checked email, and have a few replies to probably delay until later.  See ya!</p>
