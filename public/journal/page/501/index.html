<p>I have just put 24 megabytes of pictures from the <a
href='https://www.robnugen.com/cgi-local/images.cgi?dir=rallies/houston2002'>Houston
Rally</a> on my site.  That's a lot of pics.</p>

<p>I haven't optimized them, renamed them nor thumbnailed them.  No
promises on when that may or may not happen.</p>

<p>They are in chronological order, though, so that may help you sift
through them.</p>

<p>The G3 project seems to be turning into a horrible nightmare of
requirement conflicts, unmaintainable code, and all sorts of crap.</p>

<p>Take the project with the name SAD.  Dave has been working on part
of it - creating a web based tool that will allow easy sending of
emails to people who need emails.  But his code will only work when
uncompiled on the test machine, while all the data needed is of course
on the live cluster.</p>

<p>We had some design changes discussed in November, and at that time
I thought I understood all the needs and had it all planned out.  But
I apparently didn't make my understanding clear or something, cause
now we are suddenly aware that we need it to work within 10 days, and
the change I made isn't enough to make it happen.</p>

<p>Plus, there is a change that I thought Patrick was going to make,
but I was apparently wrong.</p>

<p><a href="/images/construction/59/shepherd_exit/texas_wall.jpg"><img
src="/images/construction/59/shepherd_exit/thumbs/texas_wall.jpg"></a> Anyway, there is a big backhoe
ripping down the retaining wall along highway 59 outside our
building.</p>

<p><a href="/images/construction/59/shepherd_exit/wall1.jpg"><img

<a href="/images/construction/59/shepherd_exit/wall2.jpg"><img
src="/images/construction/59/shepherd_exit/thumbs/wall2.jpg"></a> This is way more
interesting than a nightmare of code.</p>

<p class=date>8pm</p>

<p><a href="/images/construction/59/shepherd_exit/wall_edge.jpg"><img
src="/images/construction/59/shepherd_exit/thumbs/wall_edge.jpg"></a> After work I
rode around the area, and decided not to ride down the steep
embankment.</p>

<p>I'm so smart.</p>

<p>I have just arrived back at work so I can do some coding on the G3
project.  I got specs from Patrick and it shouldn't be too terribly
difficult nor dangerous to code.</p>

<p class=date>3:42am</p>

<p>Word.  Finished.  That went even better than I anticipated.  Thank
you, and good night.</p>

<p>I went to bed early-ish last night - like 9pm, and slept till a bit
after 7am and ended up being 20 minutes late for my dentist
appointment.  But I got a free toothbrush anyway, and a pretty good
dental bill of health, and not so bad dental bill.</p>

<p>It's freezing cold today; we're breaking historical records with a
high of like only 30 few degrees today.  Yuck.</p>

<p>The weekend was great; I haven't written anything about it yet. One
day, one day soon I will.</p>

<p>When I telnet to my robnugen.com account, it will time out after a
few minutes of inactivity.  But if I'm running emacs on that server,
the telnet connection will remain connected for hours and hours.
Emacs rules.</p>

<p>Dude just sent me a <a href="/scripts/clock.html">javascript
clock</a> which is pretty cool.  I don't know who wrote it, but I'm
quite impressed with its skillz.  I altered the day of week names and
month names and it handled the spacing with no problem.  The source
code is in the same directory.</p>

<p>Um, today I documented how to create and send emails for a project
that I've been working on for a while.  Documentation is part of
helping me get out of here.  In this specific case, it's so I can go
to Europe in 2 weeks!</p>

<p>I sent a snail mail to Alexis in Japan today.  I even copied her
name in katakana on the front.  (I don't know the katakana yet, but
I'm close to knowing all the hiragana.)</p>

<p>Um, oh my spam free lycos account is apparently going to work well
for me.  My address is still thunderrabbit@cheerful.com, which sends
emails to thunderrabbit@yahoo.com.  I will eventually have
thunderrabbit@cheerful.com send mail to thunderrabbit@lycos.com.</p>

<p>But first, I need to tell lycos from whom I am willing to receive
emails.  I cannot yet import my email address book from yahoo, so I
have to enter names manually.  Once basically everyone is able to send
email to my lycos account, I'll switch thunderrabbit@cheerful.com to
send email to lycos instead of yahoo.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to send me mail on my new spam free account
email me at the cheerful address and let me know.  I'll tell you when
to try sending email to lycos.</p>

<p>I know it's a pain in the arse, but I believe it will be worth it
once I no longer receive spam.  Wow.</p>

<p>I've been actually working today.  I put a final tweak on the
generic G3 survey creator, and I'm basically ready to present it to
peeps here so we can document its awesomeness and so other people will
know how to use it so I can leave.</p>

<p>Have again been negotiating price for the code management software,
and actually trying to get a 30 day free trial (again) so other people
here can use it.</p>

<p>Going to lunch at MB with Dude and Gene at 12:30pm</p>

<p class=date>2:04pm</p>

<p>Most interesting thing about lunch was the dynamics of the group.
Usually when I go and it's all Dude's friends from work, they all talk
about work.  This time it was all Dude's friends from work, plus me,
and Gene, and Dude's friend Ashley, a woman he knows from school.</p>

<p>Instead of Dude's friends all talking about work, the conversation
was completely dominated by Dude and Ashley, as they told stories
about their mutual college days.  The rest of the group just ate and
listened in relative silence.</p>

<p>The stories were certainly funny, and she is fairly attractive, so
I wonder if that's all it took to shift the conversation.</p>

<p class=date>5:23pm</p>

<p>Now I'm reading up on procmail a bit so I can receive email
messages from a mailing list on my new super-anti-spam email account.</p>

<p>For some reason, it's <em>cold</em> today.  Like 34 degrees F, and
plenty of wind to make it feel like 20 few degrees.</p>

<p>Tonight it will actually be around 20 degrees and in the 10s north
and west of here.</p>

<p>Even so, I walked to work today.  But I did wear socks, shoes,
sweatpants, sweatshirt, my knit cap, and gilligan hat over my normal
attire.</p>

<p>I pretty much worked today.  Got the create-a-survey thing pretty
well finished a few days ago and was able to test it today.  It's
super slick and speedy, just the way I had envisioned.</p>

<p>Also have been negotiating prices for some code management
software.  I think that is about finished.</p>

<p>And I imported a short list of questions for use in our generic 360
survey.</p>

<p>non-work related:  I found out from Wende that we are close to
accepting an offer on our house - gotta sign the papers tomorrow, and
if all goes as scheduled, we'll close on 19 March.   I told her I'd be
slightly out of town in London, but I'm sure we can work around that
detail.  I also chatted with Bryn a bit, making some plans for
our upcoming trip!</p>

<p>It's still freeeeeeezing, and will be even colder later tonight.
Yikes.</p>

<p>Oh, and also not work related, our girlscout cookies came in.  I
ate 1/2 a box of Thin Mints.</p>

<p>So my latest cute girl friend person is Amy, who I barely know, but
she helps me laugh over AIM, and Dude assures me that she's cool, and
she knows French, and is relatively active outdoors-y type.  But I
really only know her in the context of work or online chat.</p>

<p>I wanna go out with her I think but I don't trust myself to keep
appropriate boundaries = no kissing, nothing more than a good hug or
so at the end.</p>

<p>I'd like to hang out with her at Dude's maybe, which would be a
good safe neutral place for us.  But there is no Wednesday night
dinner there this week, and I don't want to wait all the way until
next week...  argh.</p>
