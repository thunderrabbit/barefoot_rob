<p>Glad she&rsquo;s doing well!  We looked at her websites while in 5th floor
cafe above newly renovated Chigasaki station a bit after lunch at
Saizeria in Chigasaki.</p>

<p>I told her about men&rsquo;s group starting up on Mondays in Hiroo, and I&rsquo;ll
invite Yuji to see if he&rsquo;d be interested.</p>

<pre><code>The team at https://hellokraftwerk.com/ are producing a really cool
&quot;portable power plant&quot; which I backed on Kickstarter.

They've been hard at work, progressing nicely, but a big portion
of their time is being spent on a lawsuit regarding the *name* of
their product.

They need to raise $2 million to cover these unexpected legal
fees.  The company seems great in all other respects.  From their
about page:

    [T]he originator of the idea is Sascha Kühn, CEO and founder 
    of eZelleron Inc. After obtaining a degree in materials science, 
    he went to complete a PhD in high temperature fuel cells. He
    has many years of in-depth experience in this future technology.
    Sascha is the author of more than 30 patent applications and 
    has already won several industry awards.

Can you please please please help them out?  I think their product
and ideas will help revolutionize portable power supplies, and
help people lead more active lifestyles.

<p>This is a note to Mayumi after she was asking me about computer
lifespans, etc.</p>

<h2 id="there-are-probably-errors-in-the-tripe-below">there are probably errors in the tripe below.</h2>

<p>Hard drives are rated with various numbers (e.g. speed, size,
dimensions) and others, including MTBF (mean time between failures).
I think the average hard drive we might buy in the shop has 10,000
hours or 15,000 hours MTBF, which I believe means this model of hard
drive can, on average, be used for 10,000 to 15,000 hours before it
fails to do its job (store and retrieve data).</p>

<p>10,000 hours is the average, so you might get lucky and have a drive
that lasts far longer.  If it gets just the right amount of exercise
and enjoys a peaceful lifestyle, it will probably last longer.</p>

<p>If your hard drive has recently started to make a &ldquo;weird noise,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s
very likely saying &ldquo;さよなら&rdquo; and you should get your data off as soon
as possible.</p>

<p>BUT, if the noise has been going for some weeks or months, it&rsquo;s
probably just your computer&rsquo;s fan, which can likely be replaced for
around 5000 yen (if you have the right screw drivers)</p>

<p>In any case, a hard drive can stop working without warning, so (as you
mentioned) you should keep a backup of your data somewhere.</p>

<p>dropbox.com is probably the most popular free service dedicated to this
kind of online storage; they offer some gigabytes of space for free,
and you can pay for larger plans.</p>

<p>spideroak.com is the provider I use.  It costs money, but they encrypt the
data so no one (but me) can get my data from their servers.</p>

<p>There are other solutions as well; if you are interested in keeping
your photos, why not start an online photo album?  Picasa and Flickr
are options which come to mind.  There are others, including paid
services (Smugmug, etc).</p>

<p>If any of this is interesting to you, I can write more, but searching
online will give you a plethora of options.</p>

<p>Nearly got my audio manager thing working for the osTV app we&rsquo;re
making, but it&rsquo;s got a design flaw or two or more.  Basically it needs
to load data from the web before it knows what words it can play.  So
I need it to wait for the words&hellip; maybe I can make it a singleton to
simplify things.  hmm</p>

<p>JB called me this morning just after Lin and I finished meditation.
&ldquo;Hey can you leave right now to teach a lesson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I arrived a few minutes late, but the students were lovely, eager,
varied, inquisitive, and several other adjectives that mean nice.</p>

<p>I was pinch hitting for Benny, who I know from NOVA back in the day,
so I told them to ask him about &ldquo;baseball loudspeaker,&rdquo; a story he may
have told them already, but I wanted to make sure they hear it because
I think they&rsquo;d enjoy it.</p>

<p>We talked about Texas, Houston, names, the Lone Ranger, the Texas
Rangers, food, pastimes, Bush, CIA, WTC7, and at the very end, alien
bases on the back side of the moon.</p>

<p>The time seemed to zip by, and at the end I received some candy from
Junko, a chocolate bar from Reiko, and a payment for lunch because
they assumed I hadn&rsquo;t brought any lunch after being called on such
short notice.  I emailed JB to say it was lovely, and I&rsquo;ll be happy to
teach there any time they like.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m headed to next lesson, though I have a bit of a gap which I
hope to fill with food for me and my computer (but esp. my phone)</p>

<p>This morning I worked a bit on Apple TV app, but couldn&rsquo;t figure out
how to set the <code>preferredFocus</code> to the correct view.  I see what the
docs say, and I tried to click and drag the thing in the interface,
but it simply didn&rsquo;t work.  Bah.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll skip it for now and move on to the next bit.</p>

<p>Then at CB I increased the images on two of the site indices to be 90
by 90 pixels instead of 70 by 70.  It took a teeeeny bit of CSS
tweakin&rsquo; to make them look okay, but it wasn&rsquo;t too bad.</p>

<p>Then for AB, I tried updating the datatables plugin, but it still
doesn&rsquo;t look right in Chrome.</p>

<p>Eda invited me to lunch in exchange for helping her with questions
about her new (first) smartphone. She&rsquo;s pretty smart herself, so she
figured most of it out in between the time we arranged the lunch and
had the lunch, but we still enjoyed the lunch a bunch, chatting about
cats and such, plus a couple questions about which she had no hunch.</p>

<p>She showed me her website.. (I think it&rsquo;s
<a href="https://mouseintokyo.wordpress.com)">https://mouseintokyo.wordpress.com)</a>, and I showed her my game (I think
it&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.poppopchaos.com/)">https://www.poppopchaos.com/)</a>, and I showed her my website, which
has a problem in https mode.  robnugen.com refreshes to
<a href="https://new.robnugen.com/">https://new.robnugen.com/</a> which fails to load its CSS for some
reason&hellip;.  ohh I bet I know why!  I probably laods the CSS files
using http instead of // so they are refused when the site is
loaded using https.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll fix that as soon as I remember.</p>

<p>Done, I think!</p>

<p>yep.  Yay!</p>
