<p>Good stuff at work:</p>

<p>!) My day started out busy and then tapered off at the end.</p>

<p>@) A couple of lessons were really funny slash really great for
other reasons.</p>

<p>#) The best lesson was one that started out badly (not in a bad bad
way, but I couldn't find a folder and when I told the student I
couldn't find the folder, he assumed I meant he was in the wrong
room)</p>

<p>$) Steve wasn't there (always true on Saturdays)</p>

<p>%) One more thing that I don't remember.</p>

<p>^) A full 170 degree rainbow greeted me as I left the building.</p>

<p>&) I got a seat on the train on the way home.</p>

<p>Bad stuff at work:</p>

<p>.)</p>

<p class=date>8:55pm</p>

<p>I remembered what I had forgotten for number % above.  In the
teachers' lounge we often play music and the music is often hip hop.</p>

<p>Totally pumped</p>

<p>I'm learning Japanese</p>

<p>I've got three (3) different classes for the price of one!!!1 <! 1
is intentional></p>

<p>I'm paying Ayana 3000 yen per 1.5 hour classes, and I'm paying Koko
100 yen per 2 hour classes, and I'm paying the international lounge
100 yen per 2 hour classes!</p>

<p>Tonight I met with Ayana for the first time.  She came to the
Starbucks (aahhhh!! they're everywhere!) near my work at 7pm and
waited until 9pm when I got off.  She told me about ko and so and ah
and I can tell very quickly that I'm not going to be typing in my
journal all that I learn.</p>

<p>She gave me several nouns and how to ask what is this and where is
that and what time is it and the answers to what time is it for the
top and bottoms of the hours.</p>

<p>AND she said that if I study, I'll be speaking Japanese in three
months.  Awesome.</p>

<p>Am I tired?  Or is this what Annie was telling me about: an excuse
my body is trying to create to keep me from embracing the world around
me?</p>

<p>Today at 10am, I'm meeting a woman named Koyuko (I think) who
learned that I want to take private Japanese lessons.  I'll get up now
and zip over to the International Lounge and practice / write flash
cards before we meet.</p>

<p>Oh my gosh.  So amazing.  So incredible.  I'm so blessed.</p>

<p>I met with Koko (short for Kayoko) this morning; she will be my
personal tutor on Wednesdays.  I'll teach her English and she'll teach
me Japanese.</p>

<p>I was more than willing to pay 1000 yen per lesson, but she was
like "no no no no" and asked that I pay 100 yen per lesson just to pay
for photocopying materials.</p>

<p>Her mom was there (chaperoning the first meeting?) and when Koko
asked if I had any problems with my Japanese life, I was all, "um, I
wonder how I can buy a used bike," she yammered with her mom for a
second and then ... you guessed it, "you can use our bike."</p>

<p>And I'm like, "shit, dawg, I don't want to take your family's
bike!" or something like that and they explained that they bought it
for mom to use, but it's too big and has been wasting away in the
garage; they don't even know if the tires have air.</p>

<p>WHOOHOOOOOO!!</p>

<p>So Koko is going to bring it next week.  I'll meet with her on
Wednesday at 10am, and I assume all subsequent Wednesdays until
further notice.  Yahoooo!!!!!!</p>

<p>She went through the flash cards I had made, correcting a few.  She
showed me the kanji of the various trains on the Toyoku line (my local
line (and hers too)).  Told me that the kanji for different lines may
be different (which could explain why the shit seems so confusing!)</p>

<p>Kickin' it in Harajuku with Andrew and Ben.  We're eating crepes
(they) and ice cream (me) at a cool little cafe thing with the coolest
C-shaped brick tunnel thing in which the employees stand while behind
the counter.</p>

<p>I've taken many pictures of funny / fucked up English on T-shirts
and signs.</p>

<p>At a shrine, I bought a souvenier or three.  (Three)  The sample
souvenier fell when the girl selected a boxed one for me.  I tried to
catch it, but instead picked up the pieces.  Shoulda taken a picture
of it first, but oh well.</p>

<p>Saw a woman wearing traditional somethinsomethin having her photo
taken by several people, including some tourists, including me.  I
overheard a bystander say that it costs $10,000 US to have a wedding
there at the shrine.</p>

<p>I took some fun photos today.  Each of us spotted different things,
Andrew with his artistic eye, Ben with his belief that he doesn't take
many pictures, me with my digital camera that turns off by itself
snapping many photos of random stuff cause bits are cheap.</p>

<p>Funny that I went up to the bicycle-taxi rider in broken English
"We photo on taxi?" and he's all "yeah sure."</p>

<p>"Haha!  He speaks English" I announced back to A & B.  I posed in
the driver's seat with them in the back.</p>

<p>The neighborhood around Harajuku has awesome shops and architecture
and the cool shrine at which we started.  Definitely worth a
visit.</p>

<p>Shibuya is the station at the Tokyo end of my train line.  It's the
one with four tracks all beginning/ending in one room.  The trains
come in, everyone gets off on one side and everyone else gets boards
on the other.</p>

<p>Trains all start here, but they visit different stations down the
line.  Local trains hit all the stations.  Express trains hit fewer
stations.  Limited Express trains hit even fewer.  I don't know how
Commuter Express trains compare to the others.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure that I can take an Express but not a Limited
Express and get to my station.  I'm on an express now.  I waited for
the previous (Local) train to leave so I'd be first in line to get on
this train (at the door very back door of the train, deepest into the
station, closest to the End Of The Line).</p>

<p>People are crowded standing in front of me but they're not
<em>packed</em>.  Basically everyone has 4 inches of space between
them.</p>
