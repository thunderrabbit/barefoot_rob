<p><p>Today is Wende&rsquo;s birthday!  Maggie and I just ordered her some lovely
colorful crystal globes that Wen will hang in her windows.  Lovely, just
lovely!</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m doing research today on how to set up a VPN = virtual private
network between our office and the home offices of my bosses.  Talked to
pdq.net and got some good information and prices and such.</p>

<p><p>Last night ultimte frisbee was great!!  I played for a relatively short
time - for maybe 20 points (we don&rsquo;t keep score)&hellip;  I wanted to spend
happy time with Wende.  She made instant mashed potatos and pizza bites for
dinner.  Chocolate chip cookie dough for desert.  Mmm mm good!</p>

<p><p>I think I figured out the problem with Karla&rsquo;s monitor; the VGA adapter
card is different than other adapters we&rsquo;ve gotten.  We received the same
driver from the computer place that put it together; they said it &ldquo;should
work.&rdquo;    I downloaded the correct driver according to the adapter
manufacturer.  I&rsquo;ll install it when Karla gets off her machine.</p>

<p><p>See ya!</p>

<p class=date>10:52pm CST Thursday 24 February 2000</p></p>

<p><p>For Alex&rsquo;s birthday tomorrow, Wende asked my to buy a cake, have
&ldquo;Happy Birthday Alex&rdquo; written on it and bring it to Wende&rsquo;s work so
Alex can get it at 5am tomorrow when Alex comes in.</p>

<p><p>I got the cake at Kroger and had ALEX written in four different
colors - one for each letter&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t know if Alex is male or
female, so I figured multi colored is gender neutral enough.</p>

<p><p>For fun, I got two cupcakes, one with a W and one with a B, for
Wende and her friend Belinda at Container Store.  When I brought the
cake and cupcakes to Wende, &ldquo;you said &lsquo;Happy Birthday Allen&rsquo; right?&rdquo;
I teased, Belinda was not there.  No cupcaked for her.  Doh!</p>

<p><p>Wende was ecstatic to have her own cake.  After she got off work we
went to Mission Burritos to munch.  I brought the cupcakes.  One for
Wende, and the other for Bunny.</p>

<p><p>Oh my goodness there was So Much sugar on those cupcakes.  Not too
much for me to handle in a few bites, but my stomach was certainly
all, &ldquo;hey take it easy with that sugar!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Now we&rsquo;re at my house to hang out for the evening.</p>

<p><p><img src='/images/rob/wL-ROB.gif'></p>

<p><p>ps: a new e-friend of mine indicated that having some sort of
biography (&ldquo;just who is this Rob person?&rdquo;) might help new visitors to
my site from feeling like they just stepped into the middle of a
conversation, so to speak.  Hmmm.</p>

<p><p>Awright.. I am <em>still</em> working on Rebecca&rsquo;s website thing
that I mentioned a couple days ago.  This has taken just way way too
long!</p>

<p><p>KTRU was fun this morning!  I played some good tunes, had a couple
of good errors, got a funny phone call, and I my last song was a great
one by DJ Craze.  I listened to it pretty loudly in the headphones and
when I went on the air right after the song, SQUEAEEAALEEELL went the
feedback.  oops!   Good thing I was recording my show!</p>

<p><p>There&rsquo;s a CD by (or called) <a
href="https://www.protonaccelerator.com">Proton Accelerator</a> that I
reviewed for KTRU.  The music wasn&rsquo;t all that amazing, but underneath
tracks 8-33, a barely audible spoken word portion spans all the
tracks.  The tracks themselves are each 65 seconds long of the same
guitar riff looped on each track.  Back some months ago, my brother
sent me a CD that had a similar sound (barely audible vocal under
music).  On his CD, the music portion on the left channel was the
phase inverse of the right channel.  Combining the channels made the
music sound cancel itself entirely, resulting in clearly audible
vocals.  Amazing!</p>

<p><p>I thought the same thing might be true for this CD, but I couldn&rsquo;t
make it work the way I thought it should.  I emailed them to see if I
could get any answers.</p>

<p><p>Yesterday at work, I got a review/meeting with my bosses.  It was
great!  They are quite ultra pleased with my efforts and expressed
desire for me to not leave in April 2001.  They asked what type of
stuff I would like to focus on; I said more towards programming than
network stuff.  They recognize the value of having each person work
where they feel best capable, so I will begin shifting more towards
programming soon!  Yippee!!</p>

<p><p>Today I joined Wende in picking up her Aggie Ring.  She was so
excited!!!</p>

<p><p>In this email, 5x5 and 4x4 refer to &ldquo;Rubik&rsquo;s&rdquo; cubes of size 5x5x5 and 4x4x4 respectively.</p>

<pre>
   From:  Fred Nugen                          04:00 
Subject:  5x5 reduced to 4x4 (hopefully)
     To:  thunderrabbitATcheerfulDOTcom

G -

My initial assertion about solving the 5x5 is now valid.  I have
solved it down to the point of needing to switch two side edge pieces
(as opposed to a center edge piece), as in:

c  se ce se  c      c: corner or center
se cc cs cc se     se: side edge
ce cs  c cs ce     ce: center edge
se cc cs cc se     cc: center corner 
c  se ce se  c     cs: center side

This was the same place I was stuck at on the 4x4, only now I have to
find a solution that preserves the center stripes as well as the rest
of the cube.  That additional constraint shouldn't be so hard to get
around, though.

So I really am only one trick away from solving the 5x5, though that
trick is a hard trick which I'm not likely to figure out any time
soon. (Uh, well, it may be more like two tricks: I may have to
position them, and then orient them.)  Obviously, once I've gotten it,
I'll've also solved the 4x4.  At that point, it's off to the 6x6 and
7x7.  Though I don't expect to find physical versions, there's a nice
java app at <a href="https://www.tdb.uu.se/~karl">https://www.tdb.uu.se/~karl</a> I could expand to simulate
them.

Let me know when you've figured out how to get the 3x3 center squares
solved, and I'll tell you how to put the edges together.  Or, if you
like, I'll let you figure it out for yourself.

All right, time for lunch.

<p><p>Today was not entirely wasted at work.  This morning, I showed my boss a
cool little technique to determine the client&rsquo;s screen width and height.  I
had a little problem when I was testing it, though.  I set my adapter to
1600 x 1200 pixels and 65536 colors.  Clicked OK and <em>blink</em> my
screen went black.</p>

<p><p>damn.</p>

<p><p>I hadn&rsquo;t tested it first.</p>

<p><p>I was able to boot into plain VGA mode, but changing the settings in
that mode did not affect the non VGA mode.  I couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to
delete the drivers.  I tried to install incorrect drivers.  I tried lots of
stuff.</p>

<p><p>Went to lunch with Wende to ewww James Coney Island (she likes it; I got
a baked potato).  I enjoyed the break from my computer troubles.</p>

<p><p><a href="/images/construction/59/shepherd_exit/shepherd1.jpg"><img
src="/images/construction/59/shepherd_exit/thumbs/shepherd1.jpg"
align=left></a>I dawdled (fun word!) on the way back to work, and
talked to a guy who was working on Shepherd feeder in front of our
building.  A man was using a big hammer thing to smash holes into the
pavement, making our building shake a bit each time.  I asked him how
much the hammer thing weighed.  &ldquo;A bunch!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>His job was to take seismic readings to make sure they wouldn&rsquo;t shake
apart any of the buildings nearby.</p>

<p><p>After a bit I went back inside to do blind battle with my computer
again.</p>

<p><p>I went back to the original approach of trying to reset the screen
though I couldn&rsquo;t see it.  Finally, after many trial and errors, I did it!
 Here&rsquo;s the trick:</p>

<p><p>I booted into normal mode, let the drives settle, repeatedly hit ESC and
Alt-F4 and CTRL-w until I guessed all the windows were closed, moved the
mouse way toward the lower right corner, then moved it up a bit and right
clicked.  I pressed &lsquo;r&rsquo; then shift-tab then right arrow several times, then
tab, then down arrow twice, then tab then left arrow twice, then alt-e,
then left arrow, then return.  Magically, beatifully, the screen tested the
640x480 pixel mode then went back to black.  I pressed left arrow, then
return.  The screen came back to 640x480!  Yay!!!!</p>

<p><p>To be sure, it took my several tries to get all those keystrokes
correct!  I used a different NT machine to see what I should press to do
it.</p>

<p class=date>11:09am CST Sunday 20 February 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Last night after sleepin&rsquo; after ultimate, I took pics over to
Dude&rsquo;s and scanned them.  Actually was able to drop off a roll at
7:45pm and pick up the developed pics an hour later at Walgreen&rsquo;s (I&rsquo;m
not astonished by the 1 hour processing, but the processing that late
in the day!), so I could get the ultimate pics.</p>

<p><p>Several of the pics are from Dallas Rally, which I know I still
have not written about.</p>

<p><p>Scanned some of highway construction near my work, and some from
water line repair on Montrose. (Did I tell you that story?  A dude was
using a backhoe to bail water out of a hole being filled by a broken
water main.)</p>

<p><p>Also scanned my signature like at the bottom
of this entry!  It&rsquo;s how I sign almost all my letters.</p>

<p><p>My things to do today:
<ol><li>journal update (complete when I finish this entry)
<li>budget update
<li>move all pics from Dude&rsquo;s computer to my domain
<li>research brokerages for investment club
<li>add a switchbox at work so Karla can use 1 monitor and 1 keyboard/mouse, but switch between two computers
<li>make changes to <a href="https://www.indigoangel.com">indigoangel.com</a>
<li>reply to Liz about changs for <a href="https://www.blanketstoyou.com">blanketstoyou.com</a>
<li>record Futurama and The Simpsons
<li>continue work on my website&rsquo;s image browser

9:30am.  The tournament was a &ldquo;hat&rdquo; tournament.  Everyone tosses their
name in a hat and teams are chosen at random.  I was on team 7; we met
at field 7, and during warmup, we learned names of teammates, and
dubbed ourselves Magnificent 7.</p>

<p><p>We were magnificently beaten the first game.  9 to 2.  David
&ldquo;T-bone&rdquo; (who has played ultimate well for many years) dropped the
disk two points in a row, giving them two easy points.  That was the
worst of the game, but the rest was not much better.  We took forever
lining up our offense in a &ldquo;stack&rdquo; and it just sucked.</p>

<p><p>We shlepped our stuff over to field 2 and got a breather as we
waited for our opponents.  They beat their team like 9 to 7.  Maybe
because they were tired, or maybe because we were getting better, we
beat them!!</p>

The next game we played on adjacent fields.  We lost both games, but
not as badly.  One good thing about losing is the winning team sang us
a short little song! I never got the disc particularly often during
these games.  I went long during most points and it just rarely got down
that far.  However, I did make 3 great recoveries: The disk was thrown
by our team, not caught, but deflected or otherwise missed by the
intended receiver; I caught it on 3 different occassions!</p>

By the last game, my feet were rather sore and tender; the fields
were quite hard and dry.  Our team was hugely improved since our first
game, and David&rsquo;s catches were back up to his normal incredibly high!
We won our last game!  It was quite close at the end.  At the
very end of all the games, Ed busted out a big tupperware of homemade
cookies!!  Wheeeee!!</p>

<p><p>I didn&rsquo;t stay much longer.  There was an after-game party, but I am
home to sleep.</p>

<p><p>A month ago or so, someone broke into Wende&rsquo;s apartment and stole most
of her jewelry, including her Aggie Ring.  Of all the items, she says,
there&rsquo;s only 4 that she really really wants to have back.  Her Aggie Ring
is one of them.</p>

<p><p>Yesterday, she got a call from the Aggie Ring Office; her ring has been
found!</p>

<p><p>A (homeless?) woman tried to sell it so she could feed her kids.  Took
it to Sears and at first the guy was all, no, he wouldn&rsquo;t buy it.  But then
he saw it was an Aggie Ring.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you twenty dollars for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>He bought the ring, called the Ring Office; they tracked down Wende.
 She&rsquo;ll meet the guy and get it back on Monday!</p>

<p><p>In awe of the Aggies
<br>- Rob</p>

<p class=date>9:44pm CST Friday 18 February 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Today at work I got to install a Cat 5 cable for Karla&rsquo;s new machine!  Just like my job before this one, where cable installation was a common practice!  This time I got to purchase all the equipment and parts to make it happen.  Great fun!</p>

<p><p>Had to borrow a ladder from building management; I don&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;ll purchase one or what.</p>

<p><p>Funny: I needed a small dense weight to drop down the wall so I
could easily find the hole at the bottom.  I took apart an old 340 meg
hard drive and used its little motor!  Tied the motor&rsquo;s wires to a
length of the string used to strip open cable (like the little string
in Band Aid wrappers).  Very innovative!</p>

<p><p>I did forget to purchase one thing - snips.  Invaluable
tougher-than-scissors things to cut the cables!!  Wende brought me her
wire cutters and I used those.</p>

<p><p>Tomorrow:  Huckin&rsquo; For Love, the ultimate frisbee tournament!!</p>

<p><p>With Love
<br>- Rob</p>

<p><p>Microsoft is dumb.</p>

<p><p>I just installed Win NT 4.0 on a machine.  The OS comes with IE version
3 or something.   I want to upgrade the browser.  I opened the browser and
it defaulted to www.msn.com  The msn.com website detected that I need a new
browser and sent me to an <a 
href="https://www.msn.com/help/upgrade.htm">upgrade page</a>.  Nice.  Very
convenient for the customer.  Except for one detail.</p>

<p><p>All the links on the page are broken.</p>

<p><p>I emailed webmaster@msn.com to let them know.</p>

<p><p>Then I visited <a href="https://www.netscape.com">netscape.com</a>.  The
same type of upgrade alert came up.  I selected download 128-bit security
version 4.7.  Got it no problem.</p>
