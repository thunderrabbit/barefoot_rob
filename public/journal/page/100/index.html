<p>I was invited to continue for another 6 weeks of online circle (not
really a circle, but) facilitation practice starting 20 July.  I feel
fear about leading my own groups, but I will head that direction anyway.</p>

<p>Today at Bic Camera in Lazona, I bought an extension cord for my
headset.  It will replace the male-to-male and female-to-female (and
tiny male-to-female) extension monstrosity that I bought in Akihabara
last week or so.  Hopefully this will sort out the issues I had with
sound in previous video.</p>

<p>Met R and B (Rhythm and Blues?)  B and R (Banana Republic?) in
Shinjuku today.  I hope I helped them get to Hakone easily and quickly
enough.  We rode the fastest train that would stop at my station on
its way to Odawara.</p>

<p>They have been studying in Taiwan, and came to Japan to check things
out.  They&rsquo;ve been to pretty much all the good spots on the metro map
of Tokyo.</p>

<p>B said an interesting thing that countries have had the right for
millenia to have standing armies to protect them.  Could be true, but
I wonder if it is necessary, and who benefits from having an army.</p>

<p>I invited them to read about
<a href="https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=wtc7">WTC7</a> since they had not
heard three towers fell in NYC that day.</p>

<p>Wow.  I had Lin hold her phone to her ear and hold out one arm.  I
pushed down on her arm and asked her to resist the push.  I was able
to apply 20 newtons before her arm sank.</p>

<p>Then I <em>called</em> her phone and did the same test.  She was only able to
withstand like 15 newtons.</p>

<p>Then I had her hold shungite next to her phone and did the same test.
She was able to resist 20 newtons again.</p>

<p>She was like &ldquo;wait wait wait do it again,&rdquo; so with the phone still on,
she put the shungite down and lost her arm strength again.</p>

<p>Put the shungite near the phone again and had her strength back.</p>

<p>I did <em>not</em> preface the experiment with any info.  Just did it and she
was like, woah, which was my same reaction which I had this morning
doing the strength test with Renée.</p>

<h2 id="01-47-saturday-01-july-2017-jst">01:47 Saturday 01 July 2017 JST</h2>

<p>Tonight on the Tokyo Bay cruise (1200 yen with Yukata) I met Renée who
has recently started a business called
<a href="https://www.mrsgunma.com/">MRS Gunma</a> in Gunma with her husband.
They have a romantic getaway house and an onsen nearby, plus they are
distributors for
<a href="https://www.mrsgunma.com/shungite-zero-spa">Shungite</a> a stone which
arrived on earth via meteorite back in the day in Russia, I think.</p>

<h2 id="23-03-tuesday-15-august-2017-jst">23:03 Tuesday 15 August 2017 JST</h2>

<p>For the record, I gave Renee 20,000 yen cash on the day I met her
because I was so inspired by her story.  She said she had wanted to
order some bags with her logo on them, so I gave the money as a pure
gift.  I chose not to write about it here because I hadn&rsquo;t given it to
get public kudos.</p>

<p>Now that she wants me to pay 21,000 more yen after I left a
<a href="/journal/2017/08/13/final-feedback-on-gunma-trip/">not-flattering review</a>
on Airbnb, I figure I will write (more) of the back story.</p>

<p>Tonight I talked about Marble Track 3 during the lesson with GG.  The
next streaming video I do will be for them because 6 minutes before
the lesson started, I realized I had purchased the wrong type of
extension cable (the clerk tried to tell me but I did not understand
what she said.  180 yen wasted and a new wire to get stuck in some
fish&rsquo;s gill because the shop does not accept returns. bah), and Mayumi
encouraged me to go get it sorted.  Had to moe joe with two people
because I did not know the word for female connection is the same in
Japanese. bah.</p>

<p>Anyway, thanks to them, I now have an extension.  Labeled as a meter
long, but really only like 90cm.  bah.</p>

<h2 id="21-52-thursday-29-june-2017-jst">21:52 Thursday 29 June 2017 JST</h2>

<p>oh!  I am wrong.  It is exactly a meter long within the tolerences I
can measure with Lin&rsquo;s tape measure.</p>

<p>I have often bitched about my wife not being able to speak English well,</p>

<p>but I just found some of her old emails, and I must admit she is getting better.</p>

<p>This is from 2011</p>

<pre><code>are u be in shibuya after art something?
i just about to leave so i was wondering,
let me know!
</code></pre>

<p>I hope my new awareness will help me stop bitching as much.</p>

<p>Inbox Zero Activated.</p>

<p>I just use Stars to mark emails I want to process later.</p>

<p>Inbox started to go to hell while I was in Thailand and I never got
back to zero until now.</p>
