not much above that, and too cold for my own good.  That's all there

<p class=date>9:49pm CST Wednesday 12 December 2000</p></p>

<p>We just had an interesting little adventure.  Wende got a caramel,
chocolate, and white chocolate covered apple from her Secret Santa at
work.  We munched part of it and tossed a small portion of the core
down the disposal.  In the back of my head I heard a warning signal,
but I decided it was just me being a pansy.</p>

<p>Apple piece in, disposal on, <em>grungrgrggr........</em> silence.
The disposal was stuck.   Uh oh.  The small portion of the apple core
was too much.</p>

<p>Being careful to keep the switch OFF, I stuck my hand in the
disposal and found that one of the spinning things was no longer
spinning.  It seemed to be lodged against something on the side.  I
couldn't get it unstuck just using my fingers, so we peered down into
it with a flashlight.</p>

<p>I recognized what had stopped the disposal.  Not an apple core, but
a poor misfortuned Mr Grip from Container Store.  It's a small metal
clip thing for clamping together small stacks of paper or something.
It's a design like a clothes pin: a spring holding closed two wooden
sticks.  Except in this case, these weren't wooden sticks, but little
chrome person-shaped metal things.</p>

<p>Mr Grip had gotten his leg stuck on the outside of the disposal.</p>

<p>Mr long screwdriver was able to dislodge Mr Grip, who was rinsed
clean of mr apple and then tossed into mr trashcan.</p>

<p>Disposal works fine, and I now listen more carefully to the quiet
voice in my mind.</p>

<p>According to KTRH (news radio), Houston weather plans to be
riciculously cold tomorrow.  I do not approve.  It's currently about
65 degrees and will go up to 78.  Those are on the low end of
comfortable for me.</p>

<p>They say tonight that we'll get scattered rain and silliness and
then (dramatic, ominous <em>[ Dah dah dahhhh ]</em>), 28 degrees
tomorrow.  and sleet and icky pooh.  I do not approve of such
weather!</p>

<p>I'm 'bout to visit work for the day.  I've been working on a cool
automated email writing system.  It's essentially the equivalent of
anyday billing at my old job (hi molly!) but certainly our current
setup is much simpler.</p>

<p>I just got home from picking up Dude and Veronica.  Though their
flight was late taking off, they were early arriving.  We drove home
with no delay.  Upon arrival, Dude and I started talking computer
stuff.  From our latest projects, to XML to future projects, to the
super cool project Compaq is designing with Disney, to future of
Internet access, to calculating the IP address coverage of IPv6.</p>

<p>Oh, they also told me a lot about Hurst (sp) Castle, near where

<p>Good night.</p>

                        <p><title>Skating again after so long</title>
<p class=date>5:34pm CST Sunday 10 December 2000</p></p>

<p>On the way home from church, I took Montrose over Allen Parkway as
hundreds of people jogged on Allen Parkway beneath me.  Hmm.  I think
I need to put on sktes and see what that is all about.</p>

<p>Got home, ate a snack of some crackers and cheese, then put on my
skates.  It's been too long since I've skated before.</p>

<p>Out the garage and down to Allen Parkway, where I basically had
<em>just missed</em> the truck acting as caboose.  I caught up with
it, passed it, eventually found the crowd of people collected in Sam
Houston Park (the same park that I've referred to as Coyote Park in
some of my Wild Skating Adventures).</p>

<p>I didn't know or care what they were supporting or doing, so I just
greeted the streets of downtown.  Instead of a play-by-play of every
turn I made, I shall describe some of the differences that I noticed
in downtown streets.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Jones Plaza is conspicuously missing.  The entire block where a
large elevated flat surface used to be, a fence now encloses some kind
of construction.  A guy at Bayou Place said it will be an outdoor
ampitheater.  Fair enough; we'll be able to skate on that.</p></li>

<li><p>Wide swaths of bricks now indicate crosswalks at the
intersections.  Instead of just white paint indicating where one
should walk, smallish rectangular gray paving stones mark the path.
When I first saw them, I had a concern that they may not be skate
friendly, but they are relatively smooth.</p></li>

<li><p>At some corners, large phallic concrete columns stand with a
planter on top.  They look kinda like palm trees.  About waist level
sticking out of the column as if a tree has been tapped, water leaps
from a spout about 3 feet and into a hole in the sidewalk.</p></li>

<li><p>Skaters across from Bayou Place skated through a water logged
wonderland, with easily a quarter to half inch of water across the
whole thing.  Ewww.  I was quite thankful to not be the kid who fell
fully onto his front, soaked in near frozen wetness.</p></li>

<li><p>The main lanes of I-45 are closed across Allen Parkway.  They
are being repaved as the Pierce Elevated was repaved some years ago.
(I'm sure both sections of the freeway were poured around the same
time, which means that this section of 45 was well past its planned
lifespan, as was Pierce Elevated.)  I clunked my way up from Allen
Parkway to the new clean pavement with machinery still on it.  I chose
not to skate on it.. that would be a bit too conspicuous with hundreds
of cars per minute passing on both sides.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Cool.  Wende just called and is on her way home from work.  I'm
going to unicycle over to Kroger to meet her to shop for supper.</p>

<p class=date>9:07pm CST Sunday 10 December 2000</p></p>

<p>I unicycled to Kroger, and only fell once when I was maneuvering
between a car and the grass, plus a 90 degree turn at the same time.
I didn't hit the car.  Got to Kroger and walked the uni through the
store.  Not many people really looked/cared.  That's cool to imagine
Houston as a free thinking collective that doesn't give a second
thought to modes of transportation.  Or maybe everyone is just a bunch
of snobs.</p>

<p>Wende was apparently not in the store, so I waited for her outside
for about 5 minutes that seemed like forever.</p>

<p>At first I just rolled the uni through the store, but then I found
that I could kinda hook the seat on the shopping cart handle, and it
rode there pretty effectively.  It did make the cart significantly
heavier though.</p>

<p>After shopping I unied back and Wende intercepted me at the post
office.  "Look!  That's the space station!"  She pointed to a bright
point in the sky that could have been a planet, though it was pretty
bright.  Hmmm.  I think it would appear to be moving, as many artificial
satellites do.  The station is in relatively low orbit; the shuttle
doesn't go that far out, so it can't be in geosynchronous orbit.  Hmmm.</p>

<p>I unied the rest of the way home and recorded <em>Simpsons</em> and
<em>Malcolm in the Middle</em> while Wende cooked the best, most
incredible cream corn chowder I've ever had!</p>

<p>My legs are sore.</p>

<p class=dream>At the conclusion of a TV game show, with Karla and I
as contestants (same team), the sparkly glittery dancing ballet people
were spinning with a guy holding the arm and leg of a woman and
spinning around so she was an airplane (like we might do for a small
child) and she was holding onto two other people and all three
unexpectedly slipped from his grip and slid across the floor holding
on to one another like sky divers in formation, sliding spinning
across the floor and out the door and to another room, camera Two had
to watch from a broader viewpoint to watch the crazy action.  Others
were trying to stop the renegade sliders, but they seemed frictionless
and apparently quite massive.  Finally they were stopped and the
crisis was over.</p>

   From:  Fred

Thanks, G.

When I first saw the uni box, it was the written side,
and I was like,
"I guess this is my Christmas card."  Then I saw the
other side, and I
had to laugh.  I didn't bust out or anything, just
chuckled and shook
my head.  The cutie in front of me thought it was
cool, too.  "Is that
yours?" she asked.  "Yeah, that would be my brother." 
Unfortunately,
the conversation went no further.  I got lots of
chuckles and stares
on the way home.  Every one of the stamps had been
canceled by a
stamp.  Sometimes they get lazy and just draw lines
down each row, but
not this time.  I took several pictures.  It took me a
while to unpack
it because of all the comics.  Fortunately, I learned
the name of the
cartoon "Get Fuzzy" that I'd seen once and couldn't
remember where.  I
tried a few of the edible packing thingies, and they
really did taste
like stale, unflavored Cheetos.  I thought about
crisping some up in
the oven, but figured I'd just end up with crunchy,
unflavored
Cheetos.  Somehow, I don't think you needed to pad the
inside of the
seat holder thing.  I also noticed that you let the
air out of the
tire to save on weight.  I haven't yet taken it out on
the highway,
but hope to have time for that soon.  Thanks for
sending it to me.

<p>KTRU was great fun tonight.  So awesome to get so
many calls that started with "I'm so glad you're back
on the air!"  Today I played only from CDs that were
not in the main "rock" section of CDs.  I only chose
CDs or vinyl from the "other" sections of the station,
just in an attempt to play even more different
stuff.</p>

<p>I did play 2 songs from the general stack - from
people who requested them.  One was from a cute
sounding girl who requested Ani Difranco, and the
other was from a guy named Steve, or maybe Paul
(hmmm), who requested Brian Eno.</p>

<p>Before KTRU I worked on work stuff.  This is for a
generalized email sending thing that will allow us to
automate the sending of emails that we have to send to
different peoples at different times.  The technique
we use now is human-initiated batch mode, and is
fairly stable... but we need to totally automate
it.</p>

<p>I'm leaving now to go get Dude and Veronica at the
airport.  They were just in San Luis Obispo looking
for places to live in 18 months when Veronica finishes
her medical residency.</p>

<p>Oh, and this is another entry (*) that is
XML-quality HTML.  I'm too tired to think of the
correct term.  "Well written?"</p>

<p>(*) This entry is, but the journal.cgi still does
not yet produce correct HTML.</p>

<p class=date>10:57pm CST Friday 8 December 2000</p></p>

<p>Hard Rock Cafe was loud and fun.  We spent a pretty long time at
the bar waiting for our table to be available.  On the flat wide
screen TVs (not projection TVs, but the new digital 9x16 aspect ratio
hang on the wall TVs) videos were shown, including Michael Jackson's
"Thriller."  Quite entertaining to see how bad the dancing was, and
I'm not talking <em>bad</em>.  How did he make 50 zillion dollars?</p>

<p>At the table, Taresa got a big giant pile of whipped cream on ice
cream on some brownie.  I gave Wende a big forkful of whipped cream
and she was surprised to find that it wasn't ice cream!!  She made
funny gross see-food for us all to enjoy.</p>

<p>Super special thanks to my Cynthia, my secret santa, who gave me
great stickers for letter writing.  I got much better stickers than I
could have imagined!!</p>

<p>Wende and I walked Taresa to her car by way of the ice skaters,
skating on a sopping wet crowded little rink.  So freezing must have
been the people who fell and got their bums all soaked!!  But maybe
not too freezing if they had some good cardiovascular skating going
on.  But still...  eewwwwww!</p>

<p>I'm thankful to have inline skates and all of downtown upon which
to skate.</p>
