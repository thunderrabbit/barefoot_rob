<p>Work overall was pretty okay today.  I had four man to man lessons,
two frees and two filled lessons.  In my last lesson I got the quote
of the day.  First, the situation: I had set up a role play where the
three students were two spies and their boss.  The first boss did
well, effectively saying, "you have to go to China and check the
status of SARS."  It was fine.  Then I had them repeat back what they
had been asked to do.  "I have to go to China, " etc.</p>

<p>Then I switched their roles and got a new boss.  He then uttered
the quote(s) of the day.  To his first spy, "you have to buy me a
cake."  To his second spy, "you have to clean my room."</p>

<p>Hilarious.</p>

<p>Woo  (that's not "woo" like wow, but "woo" like yikes!)</p>

<p>I just saw someone who reminded me of _____ (thanks, JP), and I had the
following transaction in my head:</p>

<p>erruu? (thanks, Scooby).  couldn't have been her.  what happened?.
we hung out banging eachother for a while and I told her I loved her
and she took that to mean more than I did. jeezus.  language.  words
words words.  Words mean nothing.  Everyone has a different language
in their mind.  broughten.  earthquaked.  love.  Actions are where
it's at.  It takes me years to know someone.  Fuck language.  Release.
namaste.  I hope everything goes well for you.  I won't contact you
again, including not paying you mo money.  Release. namaste, YRUU.  I
have my set of relationships from that time.  Not going back.</p>

<p>Called kT tonight!  She's kickin' it at a law firm up in New
England, which she's doing because she remembered the people there (at
the law firm) were nice, but now she's remembering the people there
(in Brooklyn) are not nice in general, so she has no friends.</p>

<p>Other than that, and the shooting at City Hall, everything is
fine.</p>

<br>Yo, my friend Nancy from Houston just moved up to Brooklyn in January with her husband (they got married in January). She doesn&rsquo;t have any woman type friends up there either (plz don&rsquo;t tell her I told you so) so maybe she can hook up with your friend (kim?). Her e-mail address is nancy_mostafa@yahoo.com. She is my best friend from 7th grade.<br>

<p>I have just read one single entry about SWUUSI (KBH's; it was the
first on my Friends List).</p>

<p>Feelings mushed up.  No words..  Just 12 hours ago I *decided* I
would/could never go back.  I know I can't but I want to.  All the
games; all the stories; all the lives positively lived and positively
affected.</p>

<p>And and and all the games that I won't fully grok, plus all the
stories that I won't be able to tell.</p>

<p>Things change.  Want to preserve it; want to preserve everything
*and* move on and forge new realities.   Want you to know you y r u u
ers are the best.</p>

<p>ps: ultra proud of Josephine and Amy.</p>

<p>ps not sorted: Ants and Cheese, Silent Football, Ardmore,
Applebees, talent shows, and the rest..</p>

<p>It's 1:35.  I gotta sleep.  Not that I have to be at work in less
than 11 hours, which I don't, but..  maybe it's to wash away all these
emotions.</p>

<p>I miss you guys.</p>

<p>Work was aight today.  Not fucked up busy.  No zombie students.  No
quote of the day either.  One student was a little kid who was quite
genki, but who didn't really want to speak.  But the cat was like
four.  He seemed like any other normal playful four year old.  I was
quite happy to let him do whatever he wanted.  He sat on my lap to let
me read to him as he flipped pages and pointed to various pictures and
words and when he got bored he used my outstretched legs as a
slide.</p>

<p>I wondered how much similar attention he gets with his actual
family.</p>

<p>Man I'm tired.  naptime.</p>

<p>Hung out with Mika tonight for the first time.  Was a little
nervous at first, but everything seemed just right.   I have a
girlfriend; she has a boyfriend; she wants me to correct her English;
she likes to travel and has been around England, Ireland, Paris; etc
etc blah blah blah and it was nice.</p>

<p>Turns out she hangs out with Carla too on occasion.  I wonder if
that started before it was against the rules for students and teachers
to chill.</p>

<p>She taught me a little bit of Japanese and such.  Turns out we
missed the biggest fireworks festival of the *year* to hang out
tonight, but that's cool; it couldn't have happened any other way.  I
wasn't aware of the fest when we planned our meeting, and I was hungry
at the moment we were to meet so we munched and got to hang out
instead of having our first experience together be mushed silently
onto a train and withstanding the stress of the largest crowd in the
planet, etc etc.  Plus we would have barely had time to get there
before it started, not including the fact that there's no <em>way</em>
we could have gotten good seats unless we camped out there at least
all day.</p>

<p>ANYway, we had fun and will likely hang out again in the near
future to go scope a different pyrotechnic display.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Oh.  And her birthday?  March 25.</p>

<p>Today's lesson with Ayana was pretty good; I did some cramming just
beforehand, which, in addition to some studying I had done this week,
let me squeak by with the appearance that I had been studying.</p>

<p>I seem to be back on the studying vibe, so I'll likely do even
better next time we meet.  This, however, won't be until three weeks
from now since she's going to England for two weeks to see her
friend's wedding.  Her boyfriend is in England now (Ayana has a
boyfriend?) so that makes it mo betta for her.</p>

<p>She taught me several forms today.  Te form, ta form, tai form,
something else form maybe.</p>
