<p>I got my <a href="/cgi-local/days/daysold.pl">days old counter</a>
to correctly save cookies.  It's not *perfect* in the user interface
department, but good enough.</p>

<p>Got my entire site copied to my local drive.  I think it's all
copied.</p>

<p>Emacs is doing some crazy shit with highlighting and I don't know
what's the dimdam deal.</p>

<p>Oh shit I figured it out.  I had named this journal entry
days_old.pl because .pl was so stuck in my brain.  Silly brain.</p>

<p>Yammered it up with Fred during/after selecting a lot of CDs at his
house to rip once we get back to Dallas.  Got all the NIN & Tori Amos
that he has and I don't.  Plus a lot of others.</p>

<p>Went to Star Seeds to eat, for Freddo said it's a cool 24 hour
restaurant in Austin.  Funny funny stories talking about his days at
Stanford when people made remote controls shaped like cats and
airplanes and belts and beer bottle koozies to control a TV and flight
simulator and lights in a room and another TV.  Thing is, all the
remotes had to use the same signaling protocol, so the cat could
run the TV or the flight simulator, or whatever mix-n-match people
wanted to do.  Verrrry funny.</p>

<p>Also about this cat named Will who knew sports really well because,
for example, he would drive all over to different high schools'
football games, do a writeup on the game and sell it (to both sides),
allowing them to do whatever they wanted with it, so long as he could
sell it to anyone else.  He harassed this young couple at a bar, "do
you love her?  You should tell her you love her right now!  She's the
most beautiful girl you're ever going to meet, and if you pass this
up, you'll be kicking yourself the rest of your life.  And oh, she's
an engineer?  You'll *never* find another engineer as beautiful as
she," etc etc etc just being all loud and obnoxious.  Then he was all,
"I bet you're from San Antonio... and you went to Dullis High
School...."  and he was right.  "I've <em>been</em> to Dullis High
School and you look just like every other Dullis High School student
I've ever seen..."</p>

<p>Also talked about YRUU, including Aristasha, and made up new
variants:  (all in falsetto English accent)</p>

<p>thumbs up,
<br>wrists together,
<br>arms out,
<br>elbows together,
<br>shoulders back,
<br>chest out,
<br>bum out,
<br>knees together,
<br>feet together,
<br>toes out,
<br>head back,
<br>tongue out..</p>

<p>"There's not really any more bodyparts we can use," suggested
Fred.</p>

<p>And describe the action in two words.....  "Okay, put your left
thumb in your right ear and stick your right toe in the back of your
left knee, tilt your head like this.  Aristasha! Aristasha!
Aristashasha!!"</p>

<p>Fred just filled up 13.012 gallons after traveling 215.3 miles.

<p class=date>12:25am</p>

<p>Two cars just blew the fuck past us, one on each side.  Word problem:</p>

<pre>
The driver of a red Camaro traveling 70 miles per hour on I-35 North
between Austin and Waco at approximately 12:22am watches two vehicles
pass him.  On his left, a gray Honda, and 1 second later on his right,
a black Mustang.  The driver of the red Camaro watched the Honda for 7
Scooby-Doos until it passed an identifiable landmark.  8 Scooby-Doos
later, the driver of the red Camaro reached the same landmark.

What was the average speed of the gray Honda during the 7 Scooby-Doos?

Bonus: What would be the cost of a speeding ticket for the driver of
the Honda?

Extra Bonus: What color was the bear?

Super Extra Bonus: From what 80s television program did the driver of
the red Camaro get the idea to count time in Scooby-Doos?

Super Double Extra Bonus: on which side of the roof would the egg
fall?

Ultra Triple MEGA Bonus: what was the gas mileage of the red Camaro
for its previous tank of gas?

Bonus 2: How far ahead of the red Camaro was the gray Honda after the
first 7 Scooby-Doos?
</pre>

<p class=date>3:49am CST Saturday 22 March 2003</p>

<p>Home now.  I'm considering writing a State of My Life Address, or
at least starting one, that I intend to send out before I leave.</p>

<p>Shit, I gotta do my taxes, buy pants, shirts, undershirts,
shoes.... and then pack.  But other than that I'm completely
ready.</p>

From: Wende in San Francisco
Date: Fri Mar 21, 2003  23:44:06 US/Central

Hi guys-

On the way home from work today, I walked past Union
Square as I do every day.  Today was different because
I couldn't walk across Union Square - it was
barricaded off completely and there were a ton of
police officers all decked out in riot gear.  It was a
sight that I've only seen in something like a _Time
Life_ pictures of the century compilation, but it was
on my way home - three blocks from where I live. 
Thousands of protesters have been arrested for trying
to 'shut down the city'.  We had to close the store
four hours early yesterday because our employees were
afraid for their safety both coming to work in the
evening and leaving at 10pm.  I don't understand
protesting violence with violence, but we're just
trying to deal with it and keep our sanity.  I'm
amazed at the generosity of our country that this can
happen - our police are protecting the citizens and
business of the city from the other citizens of the
city and still trying to worry about protecting
everyone from the bad guys.  

It's not that bad - I watched a silly movie tonight
and ate junk food and did all that I wanted to. 
That's my normal stuff and I wanted to not give it up.
 I'll talk to you guys later.  I'm sending much love
right now.

Blessed be-
   Wende

<p>Jack and I are fixing Heather's car tire.</p>

<p>We're at Ross New-Used Tires next to a loudspeaker on a rumbling
small diesel behind an open manhole cover.  On the truck is what
amounts to a large chinese finger trap, certainly used to grab long
things and pull them.  But I don't know what types of things those
would be.</p>

<p class=date>1:29pm</p>

<p>That was fast.  $20 for an $18 tire and $3 balance.  Nice.  The
operation there was smooth, without the structure of NTB or other big
chain.  One cat talked to customer, asked what tire(s) need
adjustment, put a jack under the affected tire, (possibly) another cat
removed the tire, bounced it to the back, (possibly) another cat found
a tire, changed it, bounced it back to the car, (possibly) another cat
put it on.</p>

<p>Been working on my days old cookies, and I thought I had the code
to a place where it would work, but... it's not working.  Only trick
is that I'm not sure how to debug my output, and I don't yet know
where the cookie file is located for my browsers (Safari and IE).  A
bit of research can find those quickly, but I may have lost impetus on
the project.</p>

<p class=date>2:10pm</p>

<p>Oh oh oh</p>

<p>I just realized I can set my browser to warn me of incoming cookies
and thereby see what's happening behind the scenes.</p>

<p>Have done some cleanup on my website; consolidating or reorganizing
some things that have been written and just moved from site to site
like old boxes of treasures that I can't bear to throw away.</p>

<p>One mind says bits are cheap, might as well keep them.</p>

<p>There's a part of me that wants to keep and archive and store
everything I've thought, somehow creating a collage of Who I Am
through my writings and recording Who I've Been in my adventures.</p>

<p>But it gets to a point where it's like shit, who cares if I keep
Every Thought I've Ever Thunk; no one is going to read them all.  Not
likely.  Well a sentient computer would.  Google will if I ever make
them all linkable.</p>

<p>I've decided it's all important enough to make a backup of
everything on my local computer.  I've been copying things for almost
an hour now and it's not all backed up.  I'm not clear that it will
finish before we leave for Austin tonight.</p>

<p>Man I've got a lot of files on my site.</p>

<p class=date>7:03pm</p>

<p>Didn't get it all copied.  We're on the way to Austin now with
Charity driving, Janette shotgun, me in a nest of blankets in the
front of the back of the van, and a bunch of stuff filling the back of
the back of the van.</p>

<p class=date>7:11pm</p>

<p>Hmmm.  Interesting.  I transcribed not very much of my first
handwritten journal and started to get a little bit ookey stomach
feeling carsick.  Combination of reading in bad light/writing/bad
posture/shake shake shake sitting sideways in a van without really
looking outside may have had something to do with it.  Gonna lay down
now.</p>

<p>Today, um..  oh I got my new glasses!  I'd put a picture online but
I wanna just write for a bit and not get too sidetracked.  They are
cool and don't have metal around the lenses, just nosepiece and
earpieces that are attached to the lenses</p>

<p>Today is the day we went to war on Iraq.  Far as I know, we haven't
actually attacked Baghdad, but Bush has led us into a corner so we
can't do otherwise.  It's all fucked up.</p>

<p>Watched 13 Ghosts last night.  The old old version, hailed as a
classic presumably for its ghost-viewing or ghost-non-viewing lenses
and creative advertising back in the day.</p>

<p>Awesome time romping around with Janette and almost got her on
BBST.  Close.  And she made awesome chicken soup.  It amazes me still
that she actually <em>makes</em> chicken soup.  When she said, "I'd
like chicken soup" and left for the store, I was thinking of cans of
soup.  Swear.  I've lived here for months and I still think canned
soup when she says chicken soup.</p>

<p>Josephine declared today as Color Outside Day.  So we colored on
the rock walkway out front.  Laura Douglas and Jack came home during the fest
and Laura joined.  Jack did not.</p>

<p><a href="/images/home/janette/dallas/color_outside_day.jpg"><img
src="/images/home/janette/dallas/thumbs/color_outside_day.jpg"></a>"Josephine
really looks like this" (written in the heart by Laura)</p>

<p><a href="/images/home/janette/dallas/whut_whut.jpg"><img
src="/images/home/janette/dallas/thumbs/whut_whut.jpg"></a> Guess who drew
this?  Guess who wrote "whut whut"</p>

<p><a href="/images/home/janette/dallas/jack.jpg"><img
src="/images/home/janette/dallas/thumbs/jack.jpg"></a> Jack (mean) would
rather play inside.  Excellent likeness by Laura.</p>

<p>I worked a while on cookies to save dates on my days old counter.
Closer, but not finished quite yet.  I think I know what else I need
to do, but it's basically time for bed bed bed.</p>

<p class=dream>In a small section of town like an amusement park with
Ma and Jon leading the way to a restaurant that they thought was
closed but was just under cleaning aor it was being built and was
really expensive but I peeked my head in the door and saw a room with
green short carpet and a partition behind which people were cleaning
the carpet and the hostess was at the other end of the room and
motioned for me to follow her, so I walked past the partiition and to
the other end of the room and outside after assuring Ma and Jon they
should come with me and they did and I reached the outside area and
the hostess had gone down some old steps of varying heights and not
supersturdy and I daintily skipped down them and then warned my mom
they were different heights so she should be careful and they got down
the steps and the hostess showed us to an outdoor table like a picnic
table big wooden kind and asked who would be paying for the bill and I
didn't say anything cause I had no money and had assumed my mom or Jon
could pay for me, and then the busboy had joined us and he said he
would pay for Jon and my mom could pay for me and everyone agreed that
was a good idea it seemed, and the hostess was describing something
and then she left and Jon was all quiet and like, "no one listens to
me" even though he hadn't said antyhthing and I'm all listening very
intently to him even though I don't understand why he woudlnt speak up
in the first place and he was all, "In dreams I just get so emotional;
My emotions come right out and I can't control them expecially
sadness" and he was going to cry and then I walked out of the
restaurant and could see a wheelbarrow full of bottles of Pace Picante
sauce and employees were taking them out of the wheel barrow and it
turned out the restaurant was not opening or cleaning, but closing and
closing right out from underneath us without them saying anything.</p>

<p class=dream>Walking down a parking lot with my friends behind me
and one friend was in front of me so I was like, "okay turn here" but
she wasn't listening until the very last driveway so I was like "okay
be sure to turn here" and she did turn right into the driveway though
it was partially blocked by traffic cones, we walked over the bridge
and I was in a locker room walking with Arnold Shwarzenegger and saw
some graffitti about someone having a lot of money like 218 million
dollars and I commented to him like, "hey and you probably do have 218
million dollars.."  and I was careful not to just follow him around,
but let ol' Arnold do his own thing and I selected my favorite locker
in the room and then went to get clothes, going out of my one room and
turning left and My locker was number 2, way down second from the
bottom row and it was the one I had always selected in this locker
room, which was part of an amusement park and it was slightly opened
but that was okay because people used these lockers all the time.</p>

<p class=dream>Then I was slecting clothes from baskets of clothes
that had just been dried, wondering about the guy who had to sort them
all, heaping baskets of shorts and underwerar and tshirts.  did he
sort them by size, or just type? </p>

<p class=dream>Leaving Dallas I noticed that each time previously that
I had gone through Dallas I had used the surface streets which gave me
a different perspective of the city, with a different viewpoint now
that I was familiar with its highways and such.  I tried to place them
in my mind, to fit the pieces together of how these surface streets
fit underneath the highways that I was seeing, and I couldn't see in
my mind how it all fit together.</p>

<p class=dream>there was one big elevated roadway like Pierce Elevated
in Houston and I was looking up at it from below, but couldn't
remember having ever driving on that highway in Dallas.</p>

<br>I like the part about the Highways. It is very odd when you drive a section of freeway that you usually go under, or vicversa. I&rsquo;ve been tolds that most modren skyscrapers are disigned to be viewed from the highway vooming by at 70 mph as appose to the old ones which are disigned to be viewed from street level.<br>
