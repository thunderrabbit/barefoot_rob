<p>super thanks to Marcel for clearing up my problem sending email:</p>

<pre>
I think it's related to RFC0001, which says that all ports have three
timeouts per period, after which normal port operations recommence
(after a brief commercial break). Unfortunately, the RFC was vague on
several important interoperability issues.  Chief among them were
timeout length, period length, and average airspeed of an unladen
swallow.  Vendors argued intensely over what these unspecified
defaults should be, with Microsoft refusing to release airspeed
figures for it's proprietary, genetically altered "Microsparrow 3.1"
product.  This split vendor support into two camps: those who had a
monopoly, and those who wish they had one. Unfortunately, those in the
monopoly-envy category had to deal with labor unions (being without
means to operate without one).  Based on my intense analysis of your
problem, you can't use Mail because port 25 labor workers have refused
to go back to work until their demands for higher wages, more paid
vacation, more official holidays, and free manicures have been met.
Unfortunately, that means packets you've sent destined for port 25 are
rotting on the IP stack, due to a classic case of "priority
inversion," whereby port worker demands for lifestyle-enhancing plush
benefits have incorrectly received a higher priority than your
communication needs.  Liberally applying baking powder to the inside
of your PowerBook should take care of the stinch of rotting packets,
although it might have other operational consequences.

<p>Just watched <em>Y Tu Mama Tambien</em>, which I really enjoyed.
American movies should be so free and expressive.</p>

<p>Just such.... depth of passion in their friendship and so
beautifully tragic to suddenly never see one another again, like the
guy who reaches the height of his life dream at age 25 and dies in a
plane crash flying to the next event.  How she knew but wouldn't tell,
and just chose to live her life dream until the final days.</p>

<p>So beautiful that the fishing family just took her in as a member
of their family.  No questions.  Full respect for her wishes.</p>

<p>So thankful to be living some of my life dreams now, with no
impending deadline.</p>

<p>Plus some of the scenes were just so hot.</p>

<p>Catherine called me tonight!!  I told her how I've been randomly
being yogastic in my posture (though I'm not right now) and that I
sometimes just stand in Tadasana for fun and meditation.  Awesome.</p>

<p>She said she has something to email me..  I've not heard from her
in *months* (nor she from me, so hey); I wonder what it is.</p>

<p class=dream>Driving up a mountain, Sally and I were helping to hold
the highway together, like reinforcing it with big metal plates,
attaching them to rocks and such to make sure that nothing would fall
apart, so that the freeway below would not collapse under its own
weight and slide down or break off the mountain.</p>

<p>Sally's out of eggs cause her houseguest from last week cooked all
12 of them in two big omelets, so I went to the market on site but
they don't have any.</p>

<p>"You ain't got no eggs?" I effectively asked the guy behind the
counter.  They do but they're all in the back.</p>

<p>"How many do you want?"</p>

<p>"Just a dozen." (*)</p>

<p>"They come singly."</p>

<p>"Um, how about five?"</p>

<p>"How about six?"</p>

<p>"Okay, six."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Walking out, I thought of two classes of funny answers to the
original question.</p>

<p>"Um, about a pound." or "Five and a half."</p>

ryan. mccarthy.</a> wrote an entry about how he's feeling like a big
slacker because he's not got a job, etc etc whatever, and wonders
something like, "but for every minute I spend learning something

<p>I replied back something about how he is doing good stuff and then,
"Just because Socrates didn't watch Simpsons doesn't mean he didn't

<p>Ryan must have thought I was pretty wise/clever.  He replied, "I'm
going to have this tattooed to my forehead."</p>

<p>Did laundry then had breakfast of three egg omelets each.</p>

<p>Took a big phat nap and then rode bikes down to the beach.</p>

<p>Walked out along the pier (I ran, negotiating the great
discontinuities in the large rocks quite well; I was impressed with my
feet) and chilled, watching boats and birds and Sally told me how to
identify particular lights (they're each numbered and each blink with
different frequency, so a body can know where the boat is located as
it tries to get back to shore).  Walked along the shore until our path
was blocked by a big rocky outcropping a bit too unclimbable to
climb.</p>

<p>On the way there we scoped out some of the houses up on the bluff.
I wondered why they have stairs instead of a slide leading down to the
beach, with four mil plastic lining the beach all the way to the surf
so they can slide and slip-n-slide from their porch to the water!</p>

<p>On the way back, I almost tried to climb a big rock, but the water
wasn't as shallow as I had hoped.  Plus it's cold cold cold.  Sally
told me that California weather is always perfect because the land is
hot and dry desert, but the water keeps it chilled to the perfectly
optimal temperature.</p>

<p>Sally saw one of the fire pits had been abandoned though the fire
still burned, so we sat by it and chatted until the wood mostly burned
down, then moved to the next fire that had been more recently
abandoned.  Once it faded for the second time (Sally rearranged the
wood the first time) we headed back.</p>

<p>I sang Ants And Cheese for her and we harmonized the song like
opera singers or some such.  Funny funny.</p>

<p>Munched tacos and told funny stories; I told her about the wolf who
said, "meow.  meow.  meow, man."  funny funny funny.</p>

<p>Livin' it up in the Hotel California...</p>

<p>That was the most comfortably I've slept so far this trip.  It was
definitely warm warm warmer, though I didn't make it all night without
my sleeping bag.</p>

<p>I'm going to ride my bike back to Sally's apartment and see if she
is home.  Actually I'm going to ride around a while and maybe find
this elusive Kinko's and then visit her; give her a bit more time to
sleep in on Saturday.</p>

<p>But first, I'll describe what I see.</p>

<p>I'm parked in a parking area for about 50 cars.  There are ducks
swimming in shallow water to my right with little penninsulas sporting
sand and some prickly looking bushy plants (2 feet tall).  Past the
ducks to my right the bay extends for a mile before being surrounded
by a 100 foot bluff with trees and houses on top.</p>

<p>In front of me I see bushes.  They are right here in the parking
lot and block my view of the bay.</p>

<p>To my left I see a rocky faced bluff facing the bay.  It looks
about 100 feet tall with big trees on top.</p>

<p>To my left left is the parking lot and a bluff behind it.</p>

<p>Overhead the sky is blue with little fluffy clouds and a jet
corridor as they keep flying overhead.  Temperature is quite
comfortable, like 75 degrees.</p>

<p>Perfect.</p>
