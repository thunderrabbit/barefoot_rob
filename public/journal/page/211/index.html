<p>Oops we&rsquo;re arriving in Yokohama soon so not much time to write.</p>

<ol>
<li>Ted ran away; he has been gone 2 days.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been working on body and soul website with Sho</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been doing AB website for past couple years but not a lot of work now.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been taking Japanese lessons at 80s Cafe in Akihabara, up to 3
times per week (for about 2 weeks now).  Have also been studying
flashcards on Anki, Memrise, and reading TextFugu</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m a bit behind on mazes, well not &ldquo;behind&rdquo; exactly but just up to
date.  Need to get some more done quickly to get ahead of schedule
again.</li>
<li>Teaching for JB school a few days per week.  Teaching on Tuesday
mornings and evenings, Wednesday evenings, Thursday mornings and
evenings, and some weekend days.</li>
<li>Have been practicing Unity 2D development, trying to put as much on
github as possible (but recently removed some code from noobtuts&rsquo;
premium offering).</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m somewhat happy with my current direction of my website
setup.. I&rsquo;ve got b.robnugen.com just serving images (b for
&ldquo;binary&rdquo;, a throwback to the old FTP days where we had to tell
which way to transfer the files, as ascii or binary).
www.robnugen.com goes to my old account, but .htaccess quickly
tosses those requests to new.robnugen.com, which is still a bit
wonky as I&rsquo;ve not got my static site generator quite set up.
Middleman is slow as fuck and Hugo can&rsquo;t handle all-utf-8
filenames.
My end goal is to write a static site that contains all the content
from robnugen.com (journal, writings (including the inane stuff
from my wiki (R.O.B.O.T. and other crap I&rsquo;ve forgotten), and
possibly old crap I didn&rsquo;t write), and new stuff: Unity samples,
etc.
All of that should be kept in git via main repo and submodules.</li>
<li>Tariq and I have essentially finished our set of Japanese apps
based on Apple Memory and its little siblings.  One misspelling fix
is waiting for approval now, and we&rsquo;re trying to get the other app
approved, but they&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s confusingly similar to some other
app, which it&rsquo;s not similar to at all.</li>
<li>TJ Bike is outside, but his seat is ripped and soaked with
rainwater a lot of the time.  His chain is rusty, but we don&rsquo;t have
an indoor place to keep him.  I&rsquo;ve just been using Lin&rsquo;s bike, who
has new tires, but no name.</li>
<li>In Unity, so far, I&rsquo;ve just gone through noobtuts tutorials: Pong,
Tetris, and Bejeweled. I am trying to jump into my own project, but
maybe I should keep going through their other toots.</li>
<li>Each time I go down to Fukuura for my lesson, I take the KQ line to
something something station, where I take the Seaside Line, which
is fun because there&rsquo;s no driver and I can sit in front.</li>
<li>Lin is working in real estate again; it&rsquo;s busy and sometimes
stressful, but she&rsquo;s glad to be back in the industry.</li>
<li>Fred and I were talking nearly every day for a while, but haven&rsquo;t
in the past week or so.  I&rsquo;ve not talked to Ma for a while, but my
dad called me on my most recent birthday.</li>
<li>ママ lives in our house downstairs; she&rsquo;s still working early
shifts.  I&rsquo;ve vaguely been able to speak with her more since I
started studying Japanese.</li>
<li>My phone is iPhone 4S which I&rsquo;ve had for a while.  My computer is
aluminum MacBookPro which I&rsquo;ve had for about 3 years now.  It&rsquo;s
about to go out of warranty.  When it can no longer handle the most
up-to-date OS X, I&rsquo;m gonna put Ubuntu on it, and when it&rsquo;s too
tired for even that, I&rsquo;ll get a non-Apple laptop.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been doing 100 pushups per day. I did extra yesterday and only
20 or so today, but I&rsquo;m at 773 for the month, thanks to PUWF (push
ups with friends)</li>

<p>Ted went outside a couple days ago and hasn&rsquo;t come back.  After a
discussion about who&rsquo;s more interested in having Ted come back and
what&rsquo;s the best way to &ldquo;make&rdquo; him come back, I went outside with Lin
as she called his name and tried to coax him out from wherever he may
be, which we assume is near our house.</p>

<p>Didn&rsquo;t find him which didn&rsquo;t surprise me.  I wish Lin could just trust
he&rsquo;s happy with his decision and let him come back if/as he deigns to
do so.</p>

<p>Good lesson with Mutsumi; her English is certainly improving, though
she doesn&rsquo;t see it! We&rsquo;ve been working on past perfect / past
continuous / present continuous.</p>

<p>Her husband joined us near the end of the lesson and gave me a cool
navy/dark gray/olive camouflage suit jacket!  wow!  It&rsquo;s barely too
small for me, but definitely wearable!</p>

<p>Shibata-san and I went to the kebab place called King Kebab on 竹下通り in Harajuku.
The shop is in a very girly area, coated in pink and hearts with
hearthrob posters around the walls.  We laughed about that; it&rsquo;s
almost embarrassing to be seen in there! haha</p>

<p>She asked about the science museum Miraikan and I said it was cool
with lots of kids, but didn&rsquo;t go in to detail about the exhibits.</p>

<p>We talked about politics a bit, up to my limit of &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like Abe&rdquo;
and I wondered why he&rsquo;s in office if no one (that I know) seems to
like him.  I didn&rsquo;t understand her answer though.</p>

<p>Afterward, it was like &ldquo;see ya never!&rdquo; because she&rsquo;s switching to a
different location (Tachikawa), and will only sporadically be in the
Harajuku office for meetings.</p>

<p>Okay I&rsquo;ve actually followed the toot a bit, but I know where I&rsquo;m
branching off.  I think the key is with the Pixels Per Unit.  In the
tutorial, each gem is exactly one game unit wide,&hellip;  that explains
why they simply cannot exist in between the grid positions.  This
in-between existence is critical for our game, so that&rsquo;s what I gotta
figure out next.</p>

<p>But right now headed to the toy store.</p>

asked me to estimate how long it would take and I ended up just doing
it to confirm my time estimate was accurate.  I added code like, &ldquo;if
userID == 1&rdquo; to block the execution unless I&rsquo;m the one logged in.</p>

<p>Hmmm interesting!  I&rsquo;m listening to
<a href="https://serialpodcast.org/">Serial</a> so now I want to record every
minute of my days!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m here at sbstrm office; my shoes are off and I&rsquo;m working on
updating the Japanese apps.</p>

<p>Amazing.  itunes.apple.com doesn&rsquo;t work in Safari on iOS simulator.
Why would that be?</p>

<p>I just did 30 pushups in one .. &ldquo;sprint&rdquo;?  What does one call a series
of pushups?  I&rsquo;m up to 753 for the month, so I&rsquo;m 53 ahead of schedule
of 100 pushups per day in April.  That&rsquo;s great because I was 200
behind schedule as of the morning of April 3rd.</p>

<p>Aha!  I got a message from Y last week saying she couldn&rsquo;t take her
lesson at 7pm.  That matched the info from M, so I was like, &ldquo;no
worries!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I got to my 5pm lesson location to meet K and she wasn&rsquo;t there&hellip;.
OOOhhhh the message from Y was actually from K who must have meant
5pm, not 7pm.  I guess!!</p>

<p>So I went up to a super-non-smoking coffee shop to work on latest
Unity project with no tutorial training wheels!  So far I&rsquo;ve got the
world&rsquo;s one and only git commit
6e1d44ad623c6c2b31c8d04487b60893f94be2a9 with
<a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/unity3d-starter"><code>README.md</code> and <code>.gitignore</code> for Unity</a>
fully set up!!</p>

<p>I apparently left the sliding glass door unlocked yesterday; Ted
opened it and got outside.  He hasn&rsquo;t come back, though we&rsquo;ve seen him
on the balcony opposite ours.</p>

<p>Jennie and Ted usually sleep in the bed with Lin, and sometimes with
me, but last night Jennie slept in the bed reserved for cats.</p>

<p>And today when ママ came home, Jennie bolted out the door, looking for
Ted, I&rsquo;m sure!</p>

<p>Lin texted me tonight, saying Jennie got out.  Lin&rsquo;s pretty sad and
worried, but she&rsquo;s never had cats before.  I&rsquo;m on the way home so I&rsquo;ll
find out soon the latest feline antics!</p>

<p>Met a young woman named Aina (愛奈) today while wandering around
Akihabara taking some video for a guy on Fiverr.  She approached me
with a small pamphlet, and I had time to spend chatting so I said HI.</p>

<p>She said we can go on a date, and I resisted teasing her, &ldquo;oh so
you&rsquo;ll be my girlfriend?&rdquo; and asked what kind of date?  Like go to
dinner or karaoke..  I asked her name and she said Aina.  I asked if
her first kanji means &ldquo;love&rdquo; and she was like, &ldquo;oh no love hotel or
anything (for our &ldquo;date&rdquo;).&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oh no no sorry for misunderstanding; I mean your kanji.. Does it mean
&ldquo;love&rdquo; and she said yes and we chatted a bit.  She lives in Kawasaki
as well!  Down on Nambu Line a few stops from Kawasaki.  Interesting!
She&rsquo;s 21 so she was 9 when I came to Japan.  Wow.</p>
