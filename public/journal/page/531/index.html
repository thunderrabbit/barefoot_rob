<p>Tina suggested I get some grass or chives for
'flowers' for Amy.  I found some celery in the kitchen
and got her a piece.  AJ was all, 'watch out, he's
trying to stalk you.'</p>

<p>hahahaahhahhaha!</p>

<p>At talent show now.</p>

The dance was hot hot <em>hot</em> hot sweaty and
lots of fun.  A few people commented positively on my
wacky Rob's Crazy Dance.  One person asked how I
learned to dance so <em>badly</em>.  I'm not sure if
that was a compliment or not.</td></tr>

<p>Thanks to Amy for buying me as her date to the

<p>Super sweaty, ate ice cream in the kitchen, then
took a shower, singing random songs.  Mostly sticking
to songs that we knew most of the words to.</p>

<p>While cleaning up after the dance, I found Amy L's

<p>Bryn, Elizabeth, Nathan and I are playing Silent
Football.  Elizabeth is dictator.  She just zoomed a
zoom zoom, and then was all, "Customary tip of the
hat!  customary shroop!  Customary we should ignore
any errors that I make."</p>

<p>I just tried to take over the dictatorship, cause
otherwise I'm pretty much in big trouble here.</p>

<p class=message>hee hee, rob didn't die because vessy
is super nice, which is not necessary because rob did
lots of stuff wrong.  but even if he had beAn awarded
penance points, our dictator, vessy, is still bloody
losing.  silly vessy.  </p>

<p class=message>being elite is sometimes just more
fun.  this may be the last time for a while, so i
don't mind a little exclusion in exchange for a lot of
memories and smiles.  =)   love, me</p>

vessy, madame dictator does not like being
dictator, i keep messsing up but oh well, i'm still
having fun nd that's the point.  rob just took 3
pictures of bryn and i trying to drink water, bryn
from the 2.5 gallon of ozarka water.  interesting.</p>
 

<p>Bryn schrodemed a shrug, and during the
deliberation of such was trying to tell Vessy how much
she loved her in sigh language, etc.</p>

<p><a href="/images/YRUU/SWUUSI2001/VessyBryn_drink2.jpg"><img
src="/images/YRUU/SWUUSI2001/VessyBryn_drink2.jpg" align=left width=150></a> Bryn
choked on water.  It's sad, but she'll be okay.</p>

<p>While Bryn was pouring water on her pants
(overflowed the bottle) and I was busy typing, Vessy
fwapped, but Bryn and I didn't know to whom it was
fwapped and Bryn was drinking water.  We think it was
to me, but both Bryn and I both fwapped.</p>

<p><a href="/images/YRUU/SWUUSI2001/VessyBryn_drink1.jpg"><img
src="/images/YRUU/SWUUSI2001/VessyBryn_drink1.jpg" align=left width=150></a></p>

<p>She threw up the water she had just drank.  "Total
waste of <em>my</em> time."</p>

<p>New rule:  "No funniness while people are trying to
hydrate themselves."</p>

<p>I just got Vessy to shrug.  I fwapped with my left
hand on the right hand side of me.</p>

<p class=date>3:20 pm</p>

Bryn just gurgled a "what?" which sounded like
"ggglll?"</p>

<p>Both Bryn and I have both forgotten that Nathan is
dictator.</p>

<p class=date>3:32 pm</p>

<p>Vessy just left to take a shower.</p>

<p class=date>3:46 pm</p>

<p>I am so falling asleep.</p>

<p>I think I just got in trouble for missing a
shrug.</p>

<p>Game over.  We simply quit.</p>

<p>Nathan is a sprinkler.</p>

<p>A sweat sprinkler?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Lilly just entered the game. It makes me happy.
It's the first game she has ever played, Between her
and dee as new players, I anticipate this to be a good
game.</p>

<p class=date>3:56 am</p>

<p>During the description of the rules, everyone
except Deanna and Lilly left the circle for various
reasons.  Deanna and Ellen were falling asleep during
the description of the rules.   At first, people who
knew the rules were leaving, but then people who
didn't know the rules left.  So; we're chillin'
listening to The Wall until peeps get back.  I'm still
going to sleep at 5:00.</p>

<p class=date>4:09 am</p>

<p>Ellen has never stayed up this late ever, Lilly
advises her that tommorow she is going to be toes up,
and her mother might hypothesize that she is on
drugs.</p>

<p class=date>4:22 am</p>

<p>lawren is trying to employ 'the face' in order to
avoid pennance points. And has just informed rob that
someone shroomed a shroom shroom.</p>

<p class=date>4:27 am</p>

<p>Lilly has just made her first sucessful tattle. It
was against me. I said 'he'. I think this brings a
tear to my eye.</p>

<p>So, lilly zoomed the ball to rob, who fwapped it to
his right. Lilly thought he fwapped it to his left,
and tried to pass it to someone. She did not produce a
duplicate football. Rob is forcing me to write his,
Stupid rob.</p>

<p class=date>4:41 am</p>

<p>ms dee has left to look at the stars.</p>

<p class=date>4:54 am</p>

<p>Miss Ellen left; I think she felt persecuted; Ryan
is talking to her; I hope all is recoverable.</p>

<p>Cake is on the CD player during breakfast right
now.  Lovely breakfast of eggs, biscuits, hasbrowns,
fruit, & cereal.</p>

<p>Last night was so very entertaining as I arrived at
the end of the road.  Sean was snoring gently, and
Joel was asleep silently between Nathan S and Bryn.  I
said HI to them and asked if there was room for 1
more.  Vessy gave me the spot between her and Sean.  I
sat down and talked a bit about people snoring, and
other random stuff, and then Bryn was all surprised,
"is there someone else here?"</p>

<p>"yes, Bryn; Rob is here!"</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>Bryn told us her experience sometimes as she's
talking when she's really tired:</p>

<p class=message><a href="/images/YRUU/SWUUSI2001/SmileyBryn.jpg"><img
src="/images/YRUU/SWUUSI2001/SmileyBryn.jpg" align=left width=150></a> "I'll be talking
about something and then like, i'll just kind of pass out.  Of course,
this action is not intentional, but my brain just shuts off.  I could
be total mid sentence- mid word even, and all of a sudden i'm having
the most random 'dreams' or pseudo dreams really.  I think about these
crazy crazy things, and i seem to have a lot of time to think about
them, but then i just 'wake up' and its beAn like 5 seconds, i have no
idea what i was talking about and i'm confused that reality is not the
same as my pseudo dream. </p>

<p class=message>"My friends in oz found this very
rude and annoying but i said, 'if you'll let me sleep,
i won't pass out!' and this theory, when tested,
proved truue.  Now, so as to avoid more
pass-out-conversations, i'm going to go sleep.  cool. 
love, me"</p>

<p>In spirit circle I had the great honor of doing
Aristisha. Fun that I was asked privately 3 different
times by SWUUSI staff.  Just to let everyone know, I
am always available for a great rousing version of
Aristisha.  Either the short version, or the original
version, or the long version, or the extended remix. 
However, the last two versions mentioned haven't been
made up yet.</p>

<p>I'm going to sleep for 1.25 hours before meetings
and stuff.</p>

<p class=message>this is sean bibby. i just found out
that i am the next co-dean with laura douglas. she is
at con con. i'm so excited. i havent told anyone.
'stress?' what stress??? i have so much time to plan
the worships and talk to Rob, Jackie, and Joana about
being 'old-school'. yeah right....oh man i'm all
smiles.</p>

<p>During our touchgroup cleanup of the bathroom, I
told them, "I'll sing, and you guys clean."</p>

<p>It worked even better than expected.  I sang the
spanish alphabet song. Ryan was all, "is it really to
the tune of the cantina song in Star Wars?"</p>

<p>Yep.</p>

<p>"Why are they singing about ants and chesse?" was
Ryan's further query.</p>

<p>Aaron interjects: "Our song is about ants and
cheeese.  Don't you remember?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>To the tune of the alphabet song ( = same as
twinkle twinkle little star and baa baa black
sheep.)</p>

<p>ants and cheese and 
<br>ants and cheese
<br>ants and cheese and 
<br>ants and cheese
<br>ants and cheese and 
<br>ants and cheese

<p>So <em>funny!!!</em> Damian was laughing his ass
off .  We'll do it during opening circle tomorrow.</p>

<p class=date>12:48 am 26-7-01</p>

<p>Worship was cool - blind snake walk into the wooded
circle area, and the sufi dances, or dances of
international peace.  The first one described went
well, but the second one got confused a few times
during the instruction, so it was a bit messed up, at
<em>no</em> fault of the youth.</p>

<p>The dance turned into a drumming circle and we're
about to play Silent Football.</p>

<p>Chillin' at Applebees now, with Gail, Wende, Ann,
Debu, and Pat.  All advisors, which is very odd for
me.</p>

<p>We did great work today; cleaned up varios lots in
Ardmore.  There was a letter/note written that blessed
our work, saying that we are 'Salt of the Earth.'</p>

This is the 4th year that we have spent a day
cleaning up in their fair city.</p>

<p>We've been in the same place-ish each time, so I
was able to recognize the clean area behing a brick
building that we cleaned 3 years ago, the first time
we came.</p>

<p>Phat Pat told us gleefully that "Phat Pat" rubs off
to "Phart"</p>

<p>We have had two birthday celebrations today.  1 for
Noah, and 1 for someone else, but I couldn't tell
who.</p>

<p>Noah and AJ just came skipping around the
restaurant, singing/chanting something and it sounded
like that were breathing helium at the moment.  Ashley
just reported that this was done as a bribe/bet thing
with their waiter.</p>

<p class=date>8:38 pm</p>

<p>Third birthday celebration just now.</p>

<p>Great fun at Applebees!</p>

shorts who is spraying bug spray on her self.</p>

<p>mr dictator turns down the anal retntiveness of the
universe two notches
'customary the universe is less anal than in it
was'</p>

<p>next play
squarewheel reverses the direction of the
football.</p>

<p>mr. dictator 'not that less anal'</p>

<p>Mike whos name is hard to type without looking 
remids the univers that  the anal retentiveness of the
universe was lowered two  notches.
mr. 'x' tried to pass to msean while  ihe waasnt
looking. the 3rd eye did him dirty. </p>

<p>all quitely hail the 'all knowing 3rd eye'
mr. dictator gives ms. sexxy shorts bug's  5  univi.
oreo 1 and 2 have been missing for quiet some time.
outside entitee's (sp) gave mr nathan a note and
showed us the flashlight that oreo 1 and 2 had. hmmm
they are trieng to show us something maybe..... 
no one got i but me....unless i'm paranoid.</p>

<p>mr green hair is afraid of 'lynchings' </p>

<p>they lyneched joel 
mt dictator ' mr greenhair is lucky'</p>

<p>no one knows where the football is at all.</p>

<p>when the foot ball gets to mr green hair mr ex
padre automatically gets the football via a 'wormhole'
and vise versa</p>

<p>mr dictator said that you cant zoom to eachother 
next play...</p>

<p>zoomed to self via wormhole. </p>

<p>new rules to counter this phenomenon</p>

<p>so hard to understand. so may new dimentions</p>

<p>mr dictator says 'i love this'</p>

<p>mr green hair fwaps a fwap fwap and rob looks at
sean and they both agree without words that pardres 
doughnut in mis pantalones  receives 1/2 pen. points.
he has to do the dance</p>

<p>all players are not alowed to hump other players
'the wormhole rceives 1/2 one pen.  point
sexxy pants just likes to make up words for the 'dick'
part of mr dictators nome. with made up words that
usually start with 'K'</p>

<p>1.333 rep.  points for mr. the bibbster</p>

<p> mr. dictator and mr the bibbster have a worm hole
between them. </p>

<p>So who starts the game?</p>

<p>the padre is putting copyrights on words thanks to
mr dic. he only chooses 'holy shit'</p>

<p>sir mumbles wants to claim the domain of mumbling
'i feel rudely interuupted' playa hata</p>

<p>'but...the fuckin amadillos!!! (turn and point)' mr
dictator mr the bibbster (who has typed all along) 
wonders how a 2 person game would go....</p>

<p>what the hell. 25 seconds went by with only rob
(dictator) and i (mr the bibbster)  passing to
eachother.</p>

<p>sir mumbles gets one penance point for causing the
universe to shit on itself.</p>

<p>he named sir mumble the damned but  i has changed
to sir mumble the darnned.</p>

<p>we all havefree speech tring to figure this thing
out.</p>

<p>so what we are doing now is taking abreak  and
trying to figure out how padre  passed it to mr
dictator and it went to mr the bibbster. i shrugged
and it went to greenhair.</p>

<p class=date>5:49 am</p>

<p>we played a game with 6 players and three 2-way
wormholes</p>

<p>Such a blessing to have been allowed to sleep
through the spirit circle.  I assume Adam was the one
who came through our cabin to wake us up.  He didn't
wake me up today, allowing me to sleep.  Nice.</p>

<p>I'm super thrilled with the batteries in this
thing.  They are only 1/2 drained.  I have another set
in case they don't make it the entire week.</p>

<p class=date>9:42 am</p>

<p>Incredibly rousing shower choir!!</p>

<p><font size=+2>The Ants Go Marching One By One
<br>Hurrah!  Hurrah!
<br>The Ants Go Marching One By One
<br>Hurrah!!! (Hurrah!) Hurrah!!
<br>The Ants Go Marching One By One
<br>The Little One Stops to Suck His Thumb
<br>And They All Go Marching Down
<br>To The Ground
<br>To Get Out Of The Rain boom boom boom</font></p>

<p>I was outside the showers waiting for one to become
free as our voices blared happy song.  So great!</p>

<p class=date>4:26 pm</p>

<p>today:

<p>hackey-sack with South African rules:  no cursing,
no kicking sand, no apologies, no letting the ball go
through your legs, no letting it touch below your
shoulder.  Otherwise, you have to run around the
circle, acting like a chicken.</p>

<p>Lunch of salad and then I joined TJ Checkley, Aaron
Ryan, Nathan Sexton, Will Warner, Matt Kime in a hot
game of ultimate.  We played about 2 points and then
quit cause it's so damn hot.</p>

<p>Then I went swimming and David Johnston on me as a
base for chicken fights, beat two other teams, I
think, or 1 team twice.</p>

<p>Phat Pat with Deanna on his shoulders beat two
teams because someone grabbed the legs of the base of
the other team.</p>

<p>Then a diving contest, which was quite
entertaining.  I think Daniel Segal won.</p>

<p>But, saddest of all, we lost Darth Maul - he got
away from the swimming area and floated too far away
to reach before people noticed.  That sneaky scared
little Darth Maul.</p>

<p class=date>7:11 pm</p>

<p>Got to talk with Lawren; learned a lot about her
home and stuff.</p>

<p class=date>2:15 am 25 july 2001</p>

<p>Social Action today was an auction.  Amy bought me
(for the dance tomorrow) for 10 dollars.  I felt
wonderfully honored; this was the highest price
allowed.</p>

<p>Mark bought himself and Hillary, Chez, Ashley, and
Meg.  Very funny.</p>

<p>Worship was lovely.  I got to sit back to back with
Mr The Bibbster.  I dropped into the bucket a single
grain of sand.  Back when I attended the inital
program at The Monroe Institute, we got to see the
Powers of Ten video.  After the video, I went outside
and looked at a single grain of sand in the sidewalk
and cried.</p>

<p>So, a single grain of sand is just as worthy as any
planet or galaxy.</p>

<p>Wrote notes to several peeps and am about to go
sleep out by the lake on the asphalt and watch stars
and grains of sand.</p>

<p>Roving was fun; I think we found 2 people kissing,
but I wasn't 100% sure.  They quit when I nudged them
with my foot.</p>

<p>Right now Noah, Scottie, Allie, Joey, Jasper, Hilly
are munching 3D barbecue doritos, and Jasper got 10 in
his mouth and Noah got 12, and Scottie got 4.  Now
I'll try.</p>

<p>I got 11, but then I started to gag as one was
going down my throat unchewed.  I chomped and forced
it down; it broke on the way down.</p>

<p>What amazing lead-by-example skills...</p>

<p class=date>3:46 am</p>

<p>We just roved throuogh the camp again, and have
woken up the next rovers.  I'm going to bed bed
bed.</p>
