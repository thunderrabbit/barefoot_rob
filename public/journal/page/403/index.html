                        <p class=date>12:35am CST Sunday 19 January 2003</p>

<p>Right now talent show.  Amy is playing harp.   I wonder, yeah
there's Fred; he wanted to hear her.</p>

<p>Just now Erica Nagel was playing piano and Joel was plinking the
highest note at various intervals, making for some simple and annoying
accompanyment.  Good job, Joel!</p>

<p>Then he played an ad lib composition, which sounded like it could
actually maybe be a song.. maybe a KTRU song, but yeah.  Funny.  Tyler
beat Joel off the piano bench with pillows.</p>

<p>I've really enjoyed watching Amy's harp skillz improve over the
years.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>So, when I arrived, I parked, got my shiznit and walked toward
where I assumed the advisor sleeping area was (it's been there all the
past years rallies have been in this church)...  got lots of hugs and
I'm glad the names just came to my brain right on target.  hugs and
hugs to all the kittens who came up to me, "ROB!!!" in surprised happy
voices..  such a fantastic greeting.</p>

<p>Joel is sitting by me now while Steve prepares to play guitar.
"Rocky Raccoon?"  Nope, not yet.</p>

<p>Slowly made my way inside, and more hugs and chit-chat with anyone
who queried about Japan or how long I'll get to stay tonight or
whatever.  Fred started pushing me in toward the main room, where I
was all "eeeeek" in my mind, having no idea what these wonderful crazy
youth may have planned.</p>

<p>Mostly chaos in the room, reminding me somewhat of Houston 1999
<em>Fricke Fiesta Con Queso</em>, and more hugs, and slowly I was
moved to one side of the room where there was a big cake iced "YRUU
Loves Rob!" So fantastic.  Colleen got everyone's attention and was
all "This is Rob and it's his last rally cause he's going to Japan"
and all this stuff and I don't totally remember it cause I was just so
swallowed up with happy/wistful emotions completely filled with love
from and for all these beautiful youth and for six previous years of
youth, equally awesome and completely unique and all the same.</p>

<p>Colleen went on, "so we're going to play a game, called Pin Rob on
Japan, where you'll get a chance to pin little faces of Rob on this
big map!"  I was all "HAHAA!!!!" and Colleen knew at that point she
had succeeded in making my going away thing great.  Awesome!</p>

<p>M&Ms were the prize, because I love Eminem.  So awesome.</p>

<p>Then the best thing was I got to cut the cake!!  Wow!!  I've never
gotten such free artistic license in cake cutting before.  I cut a big
oval around the words and inside the flowered corners, then some
radial lines and a big figure 8 thing, well a sinewave that came back
on itself with opposite amplitude, then crazy lines all over the
place... man it was awesome!  Big pieces, little pieces crazy
shapes... everyone got the perfectly sized piece designed just for
them.  Beautiful.</p>

<p>Then more chatting and yammering and hugs and then the dance
contest, which had categories: Salsa, Techno, ROB, Hip Hop, Ethnic,
Mosh Pit, Disco, and others.  I signed up for the ROB style dancing
and though it was number 8 on the list, they did it first!  For that
one they played Eminem's "Lose Yourself," which gave me a good
challenge for doing Rob's Crazy Dance since it's a relatively slow
song.  But I apparently did well (or the contest was rigged) cause I
won.  Whooo!!</p>

<p>After Erica's mom Laura won the Disco competition, I got the idea
that it must be rigged.  ;-) I commented to Sally and Josephine "haha
adults have won both contests so far."</p>

<p>The Mosh Pit contest pulled in far more contestants than had
actually signed up.  The pit got pretty crazy, so I slipped daintily
out to the side, and Ben was all "haha good job, Rob" on that.  Just
<em>yoink</em> and I slipped out of the melee.</p>

<p>During the hip hop competition, Steve Feinstein did his russian
dance thing, the trotsky I think he called it.  According to Erica,
the winners tied, but Steve was the overall winner for his "Russian
Dance thingie!"</p>

<p>After the dance, the activities dispersed to more dancing, groovy
juice making, Love Feast preparation, worship preparation.  Ed gave me
some groovy juice, which was warm!  He (and Richard and/or Casey I
assume) came up with the brilliant idea of boiling the groovy juice,
which helps the sugar dissolve and boils off some of that pesky water
that would otherwise dillute it.</p>

<p>This time it included jello and chocolate and marshmallows.  Yummmm
eeee.</p>

<p>After giving Laura Caddell some groovy juice, I met her friend
Chris, or wait, Jaime's friend Chris from Austin, though Jamie is from
Bay Area, er, Northwest Community in Houston.</p>

<p>Then we moved over to the Schweitzer Room for the love feast where
Asha explained everything andtried to keep everyone quiet during the
process..  Did pretty well, considering how unquiet people were being
overall.  I stood with eyes closed and enjoyed having various people
feed me grapes, sliced oranges and grapefruit, whipped cream, and
cubed cheese.  Totally awesome sensations.</p>

<p>Then worship, which started with Kenny introducing his dad who gave
some details on equal rights movements, including reading MLKJr's "I
have a dream" speech.  Awesome.</p>

<p>Then we lit candles while Amy played harp.  Names of peace
activists in history were read, and people called out names of
places/organizations where we want peace.</p>

<p>Then outside near what I assume is the tree we planted at Houston
Rally a few years ago (amazing how no one remembers) (I wasn't
actually at the tree planting ceremony so I won't assume that is in
fact the tree) everyone froze, but stood and sang and lit candles
again.  When candles were all extinguished, Joel kept his lit.  Then
he held his way up in the air and goes, "haha suckers!" like we had
all fallen victim to the biggest candle extinguishing hoax in history.
Joel is so funny!</p>

<p>At talent show, Katy B-H sang a song for Stevie, and then sang the
"I'm a cow" song for her as well.  Quite cute and funny.</p>

<p>Stevie is now dressed in (what's it called when a woman dressed up
as a man?  man-drag?) and lip synching Right Said Fred's "I'm Too
Sexy" to much oohs and ahhs from the audience, especially in her
briefs!!!! oh my god.</p>

<p>I'm not watching.</p>

<p>Ah, she says, "I'm a drag king"</p>

<p>This is Stevie's last last rally.  "Last rally was supposedly my
last rally, but I'll give my shpeel again, cause half the people are
new here and haven't heard it."</p>

<p class=date>1:07am</p>

<p>Now Amelia is singing and guitaring a new song.</p>

<p>(Interesting how completely awake I am, and how different this
makes my experience by attending only the last half of a rally.  I'm
not tired at Talent Show at all, whereas I usually doze during talent
shows... That's one good thing about attending only the last half of a
rally!)</p>

<p>Talent show now features some cat playing "Dead Puppies."  Oh,
these are the Jahnny Deppers.  Tim is the advisor, and Brian is the
youth.</p>

<p class=date>1:37am</p>

<p>Now Erin Dweezel that Me is playing guitar.  So fantastic to see
her out of her shell after that time I first met her at Fort Worth
Rally some year ago.  She's really a leader in the community now and
it's just fantastic.</p>

<p>Now Ben and Erin are reading skit play thing.  About Big Brother
Media and such.</p>

<p>HAHAHAHAAAHAHAH!!!  Oh my god Ben was reading the thing and kinda
got stumbled on the words and then was all, "I'm tired of this" and
threw the paper down.  HAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHA!!!  "Erin Dunn everyone!"</p>

<p>Erica: "A for Affort"</p>

<p>Tanner: "F for Failure"</p>

<p>Calder: "B for Ben"</p>

<p>Ben is reading his ever-growing poem.  Awesome stuff.  Great
tradition.</p>

<p>Now Daveed is playing violin.  Some famous dead cat's composition
in A minor.  This is memorized; he forgot to bring his music.</p>

<p>Mmmmmmm.  Daveed gave me props in his pre speech before
playing. Kelly Denham and then me.  So thankful that I can be a
positive influence on so many lives.</p>

<p>Glen just played Danny Boy on harmonica.  I think his name is Glen.</p>

<p class=date>1:57am</p>

<p>Hunter is lip synching "Fly me to the Moon"</p>

<p>Scottie says, "he's so dreamy!"</p>

<p class=date>2:00am</p>

<p>Now Hanna is monologuing something that she hasn't practiced since
Thursday.</p>

<p>Laura says:</p>

<p class=message>hi rob  : )</p>

<p>Fred is reading a poem now. (*)</p>

<p>Awwwwwwwwww it featured me.  I love you all!!!</p>

<p class=date>2:08am</p>

<p>Now Hillary and Erica are playing a duet on piano.</p>

<p class=date>2:11am</p>

<p>Richard goes, "Rob, do you wanna play silent football on your last day?"</p>

<p>"Meh.  I don't really like that game anymore."</p>

<p>(*) This is the poem Fred wrote and read to us at talent show at my
last rally, Houston 2003.</p>

[Written during the talent show at Plano Rally 2002.] 


What would YRUU be without all the hugs?
What if we had to say goodbye with just a handshake and a warm smile?
What would YRUU be without the late nights?
                   without the Talent Show?
                   without Silent Football?
                   without Ultimate frisbee?
                   without music?
                   without the Big 4?
                   without playing cards?
                           mugbooks?
                           Spoons?
                           Mafia?
What would YRUU be without "Bish"?
                   without "Yogi Bear"?
                   without the Three-Headed Question Monster? 
                           evening worship?
                   without familiar faces?
                           friendly faces?
                   without forgetting people's names?
What would YRUU be without the Sunday Morning wake-up call?
                           movies?
                           smelly bodies?
                           the blissful sleep on the ride back?
                           the advisors to see us home safely?
                   without SWUUSI?

What will YRUU be without ROB?

Who will be Mr. Dictator?
Who will bring Wonderboy?
Who will play Ultimate without shoes?
Who will go to YAC meetings and keep the hell quiet 
         (give or take an occasional snore)?
Who will we go to first with a sticky situation?

Enjoy the world, ROB.  
Tell us what it's like out there.  
Come back regularly and often.

We love you.

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>On a city bus thing in San Francisco, I was riding with
LSN Hammons on a city bus/trolley thing.  The hills were like really
steep (like in San Francisco) but we didn't have to hold on to the
railings to go up and down the hills.  We only needed to go a short
distance, but the driver wouldn't let us off until the next stop.</p>

<p class=dream>At the next stop, other YRUUers were there, though I
couldn't tell who they were, but all of them were just like hi or meh
and not HI!!!!!! when they saw me.</p>

<p>new game</p>

<p>neat-o keen, i can make new paragraphs</p>

<p>names! Happy Shrugs a lot, mr. Super duper, love parade, fro-daddy,
the crazy swede, master shake, the lord almighty god, she, mr. square
wheele, ismay eezeldway, i am cat woman, najla, Super Jesus, tiki
master, your mom, mr. bobolina mr. bob dabolina, Mr. Dictator.  </p>

<p>Conversation Probation!! haha</p>

<p>Mr. dictator did not revoke free speech but tipping the hat revokes
it, so... yeah, he formally revoked it. </p>

<p>issmay eezeldway said sayanara. she's gone. </p>

<p> happy shrugs a lot asked for free speech,. mr. dictator gave her
15 words, she said "fuck, nevermind!" [Mr Dictator replied something
like, "excellent!" referring to the low word usage.] quite funny. </p>

<p>i am cat woman shrugged a shrodem and mr dabolina mr bob dabolina
looked at the computer twice and still got her name wrong. super Jesus
tried to correct him, but didn't know mr. dabolina mr bob dabolina's
name and he got i am cat woman's name incorrectly as well. When
mr. dictator cleared up I am cat woman's name, mr dabolina mr bob
dabolina goes "that's what i said!"  she called mr dictator sir
tallywhacker tator tot. "quote dot dot dot end quote." </p>

<p>"mr dab dabba fuckin'..." -najla 
<br>najla said him and then realized
it and said it again, and then said "fuck you. ...FUCK!" all after
getting mr dabolina mr bob dabolina's name wrong immediately after
being told what it was. bob here is singing the mario brother's
song...</p>

<p>"Most people have number, i have word. I dont' have a phone
number, i have a phone word!" -Pat</p>

<p>fro daddy shrugs the crazy swede's football and she looks at him
for a while and goes "oh!" Happy shrugs a lot gets 15 words to explain
what happened and the crazy swede gets 1/2 a penance point for not
noticing the first shrug.</p>

<p>master masturbation tool master!!!!! hahahahaa</p>

<p>mr dabolina mr bob dabolina gets 1/2 a penance point for talking
out of turn, being a nuisance out of turn, talking to the president
out of turn, etc! </p>

<p>Najla forgot her own name!!</p>

<p>Somebody said it and your mom pointed it out without
quotes. Mr. dictator said "ironically, so did Your Mom." </p>

<p>Super Jesus can't get himself out of pronoun troubles.</p>

<p>lord trojan-wearing tator tot.</p>

<p>najla forgot her name... damn it, DAMN IT! - Master Shake </p>

<p>fro daddy requested a penance point check and mr. dictator said
that fro daddy had one penance point.</p>

<p>penis points "I'd just like the universe to know that i have 100 of
those..." -love parade</p>

<p>that's about quote it.</p>

<p>can you imagine if Jay and Silent Bob played silent football? "What
the fuck is a pronoun?" much laughter.</p>

<p>There's now a wormhole between mr dabolina mr bob dabolina and
master shake. whee. Master shake will apparently also be recieving mr
dabolina mr bob dabolina's (who will now be referred to as 'bob' due
to frequent refernces to him) phone calls. </p>

<p> Master asshole i mean master shake... najla's cell phone is
permenantly on. no power button. discussion of cell phones. </p>

<p>najla got 50% of a penance point for signing "fuck you" (middle
finger) where you is a pronoun.</p>

<p>When one end of the wormhole walks away, the worm hole does not
exist anymore.</p>

<p>bob refferred to mr super duper as "that kid over there" when tattling.</p>

<p>my knee itches. a lot. a whole lot. exactly one shitload.</p>

<p>mr super duper asked for permission to speak in latin. permission
denied. he was told to just do it.</p>

<p>little bunny foo foo hoppin through the forest and then he had a
aheart attack and thats the end of the song. </p>

<p>love parade's hair is now a seperate entity. there is a one way
wormhole between love parade and his hair. So stuff goes to his hair first</p>

<p class=date>5:28am</p>

<p>This game is getting pretty fucked up.  People are falling asleep
and talking out of turn and being general nuisances.</p>

<p class=date>5:33am CST Sunday 19 January 2003</p>

<p>Okay, Calder is dictator now.</p>

<p>"Can I have a wormhole?"</p>

<p>Adrianne: "Can I have a worm?"</p>

<p>Skyler's name is "I sell sea shells by the sea shore."</p>

<p>"Mr Super Duper is awarded 1/16th of one penis point and 1/2 of one
penance point."</p>

<p class=date>5:39am</p>

<p>I'm getting pretty tired.  Everyone is.  Fwaps are going crazy.</p>

<p>zzzzzz</p>

<p>Leaving Janette's now for Houston.  How amazing that the shortest
trip I've taken can feel like the longest of all.</p>

<p class=date>2:38pm</p>

<p>93 miles traveled.</p>

<p>This drive feels like it's taking forever.  Is it because I've seen
it all before?  If so, that violates my belief that suggests when a
long drive is made repetitively, that it seems to take a shorter time
after a while.  This could be described as "getting used to it," but I
think it's more precisely that the brain disengages and just goes on
auto pilot for the journey, making the time seem to pass more
quickly.</p>

<p>I've got Eminem blasting, and I'm just flat driving, which seems to
be just what I did on my driving treks.  Maybe this is different
because I have an agenda; I'm specifically driving to Houston, and am
not willing to stop anywhere along the way.  Then I'm all, "oh a stop
won't hurt" and then I'm all, "but at least get half way there."</p>

<p>And that's just the thing; I'm not even halfway there, but I'm
still all ugggg that this trip is already taking forever.</p>

<p class=date>4:49pm</p>

<p>Have basically made it to Maggie's.  At the halfway point (123
miles) I found some sunflower seeds in the magic box Janette had given
me so long ago.  Yay Janette!</p>

<p>Whooo hooo!!!  Guess what Maggie did?????</p>

<p>She got a call from Colleen who had called Janette and got Maggie's
number to tell me that I would be allowed to stay through closing
circle!!</p>

<p>Colleenie Beanie, you're my hero!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Ohhhhhh so much better.</p>

<p>Thank you thank you to everyone who helped fix this.  You're the
best!!</p>

<p class=date>7:45pm</p>

<p>Great dinner with Maggie, Molly, Kerry, Billy, David, Daniel, &
Alfred at Ugo's.  Billy is apparently a reporter (with bad spelling),
and asked us questions in the form, "what do you guys think about
________ ?" and filled in the blank with light rail, revitalizing
downtown Houston, cameras at intersections, etc.</p>

<p>On the way there Molly rode with me and told me Anna stories,
including how she has teeth and likes to bite people and the dog, who
is good natured about it.  So awesome.</p>

<p>This is all so short because I'm at the church, and very excited.</p>

<p>This morning Janette sewed on patches on the elbows of my hoodie
and I cooked breakfast - scrambled eggs with mushrooms, oregano, and a
dash of poultry seasoning.  Yummy.</p>

<p>I then read two chapters of <em>Stranger in a Strange Land</em> to
her - the two where Jubal verbally shreds Captain Heinrich while Mike
is watching a Fosterite service and trying to grok religion, and then
when Heinrich and his men come to arrest Jubal et. al. and Mike tilts
them all out of existence.</p>

<p>Now I'm about to take a shower and drive to Houston.  Hang out with
Maggie and then attend the rally.</p>

From: Gin
Date: 16 January 2003
Subject:  Back in Holland (written in November 2002)

   ***note*** Hello and Happy New Year!  This is the e-mail I wrote on
November 5th, 2002.  It is actually very typical of me not to send
letters i write.  If you have ever gotten a snail-mail letter from me
it was probably 10 pages long and written over a year before i put it
in the mail box.  A couple of months is not so bad.  I hope you are
well, and your long winter nights are filled with pleasure, love and
fortified hope...

 
    Hello incredible People!  I hope you are finding perfection in
many aspects of your life.    Thank you for the notes of
encouragement!   
     It is two weeks ago that i arrived in the Netherlands!  Two weeks
down this tarmac, a long runway to land my nature flight. I am still
rolling along, trying to settle into the transition of the new
neighborhood, the new language, the new culture, etc.   
    In the last 17 months i have spent a lot of time alone.  I am more
comfortable with my own philosophy now than before i started the
walk. I have explored many hall ways of my mind, and i feel like that
was important for me to do.  In retrospect i see that it is the very
first thought i have about something- that reverberates the longest. 
Even after hours, months or years of contemplation over a personal
issue, the first thought i had about it is the one i usually end up
coming back to.  Many of the things i wanted to sort out within myself
were mostly all ready sorted out. Being alone gave me the space and
time to learn to listen to the answers that lace the ethers of
silence.  I loved being alone. I became fascinated with my free
feelings. The ones perfectly positioned between ecstatic and placid. I
had no one to complain to, so i had no complaints.  Anything that
needed to be done, i did.  No blaming or compromising. Being alone can
be dangerously comfortable.  Luckily, i do want to
be understanding, active and communicative.  We are so many people,
and it can be so much fun together!  I think all of that alone time is
making togetherness even sweeter. Paradise can be anywhere. Running
hand in hand- being pushed by the wind over the beach during a severe
wind storm...
        I left Galicia immediately after writing the last e-mail.  I
rode the bus back towards France along a similar route that i had
walked- through many towns where i had stopped for the night.  It was
strange to see all those towns through the window of that night
bus.  I had made a huge effort not to walk along the main auto route. 
Although it made the walk much longer, it was an awesome adventure to
discover the off-road terrain of northern Spain. It took the entire
night to make the trip that it took me months to walk.
      I made my way back to the mountains where I stayed last
winter.  I have only known some of those mountain folks for 11 years,
some for 11 months, but i feel comfortable cradled between those huge
hills with them as distant neighbors.  
   The day i was going to walk up to the mountain house, i was told
that "they" (government or industry?) were going to start building a
road behind the house.  Of course building roads in road-less areas
means deforestation, among other things.  My companions on that
mountain last winter were the trees, and the flora and fauna of the
forest.  My friends are being ripped up  In the end, i am getting
older, feeling that a road might benefit someone, sometime- and that
the trees will grow back- someday.   Rationalizations do not diminish
the tragedy.   I feel my powerlessness in this situation.  I left that
mountain house void of my possessions, ready to be inhabited by
another. It is the place of dreams.  I am so glad that i will have
that silent mountain top experience forever trapped in my imagination.
     Paris is the middle of west europe. Most of the bus, train
or main auto routes going from north to south or visa-versa luckily
intersect in Paris.  The train trip from southern France to Holland
took me through Paris.  Visiting my friends there usually occurs at
the same time i am undergoing some kind of personal
metamorphosis.   For me Paris has been a place where i have made very
pivotal decisions in my life.   It must be my friends there that help
inspire thought and action. 
      Now, I am in the Netherlands, back on the little island I want
to call home.   This mud-pie-girl tore up the cobblestones in front of
the house and planted roses and tulip bulbs!  I guess it was a deeper
community bonding experience than i thought, cause today the elderly
neighbor is called me the "neighbor woman" (buurvrouw) and gave me
romantic advice!  It is never too much too soon.  There is nothing to
loose in the land of wooden shoes! 
     The gods are still watching over me.  I am now 4 days illegal. 
The brand new laws of the European Union say that a non-EU citizen can
only stay in the EU for 3 months out of 6 months.  This is one of the
modern problems that pilgrims face.  I have been here 3 months and 4
days.  As a part of our huge effort to keep me legal,  tomorrow my
dear friend Ron is going with me to visit the immigration police. I
have a million reservations, and just as many to learn to set aside. 
I am still reading my "feel right" book, and so far- so good.  
The excitement of having such a divine love in my life is something
i cherish. One day at a time. At least we don't have to get
married. But hallelujah, Lenny Kravitz says it all when he cries, "Let
Love Rule"!  Not a bad idea.  I am not having much difficulty.
      The winter money making instinct is kicking in.  I am going to
buy a sewing machine to make funny hats. I brought beeswax from Ariege
to make medicinal body creams.  I have some other ideas, but then i
open my mouth and such a sloppy dutch dribbles out, i have trouble
sounding serious.  Details. 
      Good news is that we found the only organic/bio farm on the
island, and it is a 15 minute bike ride!!!  That is heaven.  Ron's
mother gave me her old blue bike that needs tires.  I made it to town
on it the other day (to look at a hand sewing machine) in 40 minutes. 
The fantasy of learning how to sew is also a continuation of last
winter's projects. On the mountain, i hand sewed a few of those crazy
hats by candlelight.  I was also looking for a spindle to practice
spinning sheep's wool into yarn.   I tried to knit a potholder but my
knots were too tight.  More practice.  Until then, I need curtains to
give me a sense of privacy.    I think i am going to look at an
electric sewing machine before i commit to a more rustic version.  I
will also return some textbooks to the local language school. I have
my fall/winter projects cut out for me.
   All my best to y/our people!  Big hugs to you!

 ...as the earth pours her mighty winter energy into us... may you
find everything you desire...                            love, gin

<p>Today I looked for tables at work.  Talked to Oksana about who
sings "All that she wants"...  neither of us could think of it, but
then Sergei knew it's by Ace of Base.  I'm pretty amazed, considering
he doesn't seem like the kinda cat to know 'popular' American music.</p>

<p>Oksana is wondering how much her cellphone company charges her for
internet access through her phone.  She says she's been using it, but
hasn't been charged for it.  Hmmm.</p>

<p>Mike has some images of books on a bookshelf which he's using spray
adhesive to adhere to a big yellow facade painted like... the interior
of a library.  Oksana had the good idea of cutting some of the books
separately to make them lean over a bit.  Like real books.  Very
smart.</p>

<p>I'm feelin' pretty happy today, hoping to have a great time at the
rally tomorrow and to be allowed to stay more than four hours.</p>

<p>Talked to Janette about it last night, and to Rick when he came
over.  I trust that everything will work out for the highest good.</p>

<p>He wondered flat out if J N-P would actually contact HARE for me,
since she did not follow through on some phone call/conversations she
wanted to have with people after talking to him one day.  Long story.
Also it's his story, so yeah.</p>

<p>I'm at the Wolf Shop, but no one else with keys seems to be here.
Mike was just here and drove off to Starbucks.  Justin is here in his
truck.  I'm considering going to the site cause the guys over there
said they'd be working at 8.</p>

<p class=date>5:15pm</p>

<p>Ann (with keys) arrived shortly thereafter.  Today consisted of
finishing up pieces (painting, etc), loading them into the truck
(piece by piece (pun intended)), installing them at the auditorium.</p>

<p>The first performance is tonight, well, later I heard it's a dress
rehearsal, but they wanted to have all the stuff in place for the
performance.  This is a play (musical?) called _Maintenance Man_,
about a cat who is a maintenace man, apparently.</p>

<p>Most fun was..... leaving.  I helped Ann install some dangly strips
that basically look like cassette tape all pulled out of the cassette,
but not tangled in a horrendous mess (yet).</p>

<p>Oh, at the end of the day back at the shop, I helped Johnny
silkscreen some more anti-war posters.  I cleaned the screen for him
(I offered) cause it's his least favorite part of screen printing.</p>

<p>There's no Wolf Shop work tomorrow, but Johnny said I can help the
anti-war movement with him starting around 10 or 11am.</p>

<p>"Now that's my kinda starting time!"</p>
