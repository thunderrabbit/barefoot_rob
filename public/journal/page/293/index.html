<p>Completely wonderful story.</p>

<p>I loved the ironies in narration, like, &ldquo;the experience itself was different than that of our imaginations, where we sunned ourselves with fat bellies after the picnic like lions on the Savannah, then tottered home under the glorious painting presented by the Heavens in the evening. We died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I laughed several times.</p>

<p>I want so much for the story to be true. It truly does prove the courage of life can overcome astonishing adversity.</p>

<p>I cried twice near the end.</p>

<p>How funny to see me working so hard to write this description. <em>Life of Pi</em> rules.</p>

                        <p>##04:53 Saturday 29 October 2005</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to write a few lines about what I&rsquo;ve seen in the West Bank, though I have not actually picked olives yet.</p>

<p>I have a feeling this will be a long message, so I&rsquo;m going to write it in sections, and may follow up with other sections soon.</p>

<p>=======================
Section One: Vocabulary</p>

<p>When I first arrived here, I did not know the meaning / differences between &ldquo;West Bank&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gaza.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The following are my definitions, and people may disagree with them.</p>

<p>Israel: a small country between the Mediterranean Sea on the west and Jordan on the east.</p>

<p>Palestine: an even smaller country that is basically surrounded by Israel.  Palestine is basically separated into two parts.  The parts are &ldquo;West Bank&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gaza&rdquo; (or &ldquo;Gaza Strip&rdquo;).</p>

<p>West Bank: the larger section of Palestine, which is on the west bank of the Jordan river.  Hence the name, I believe.</p>

<p>Gaza: the smaller section of Palestine, on the Mediterranean Sea.</p>

<p>Occupation: Israeli soldiers with M-16 (?) machine guns are ever-present in Palestine streets (and possibly Israel, but I haven&rsquo;t been there).  In my experience, they are generally quiet, but will answer questions if I ask.  Often they say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; I&rsquo;m not from this area.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Checkpoints: Blockade or toll-plaza type places in the streets and highways where traffic is stopped and checked by Israeli soldiers. Some checkpoints completely disallow vehicular traffic from passing. (*) see Qalandia Checkpoint below.</p>

<p>Flying Checkpoints: same as checkpoints, but erected on the whim of the Israeli army.  I have seen these on highways, on sidewalks, on city streets.</p>

<p>Settlers: Israeli citizens who (often for financial reasons) are given housing from the Israeli government.  They are placed in areas that would otherwise be called Palestine (according to my definition above).  I have not met any settlers, but have heard some horrific stories of unchecked settler aggression toward Palestinians and Internationals.</p>

<p>Internationals: people who are not from Israel or Palestine, but who would like to help stop the occupation of Palestine.</p>

<p>Olive Harvest: &lsquo;tis the season farmers pick olives from trees. Sometimes settlers challenge Palestinian farmers for rights to the land.  When Internationals are present with video cameras, settlers seem less likely to be violent.</p>

<p>Refugee Camps: poor, cramped cities where displaced Palestinians have been moved when Israel was formed, or more recently as Israel has grown into previously Palestinian areas.</p>

<p>Apartheid: unequal application of rules / laws to racially separate people.  From South Africa, but has been used to describe the situation in Israel/Palestine.</p>

<p>Security Fence:
Separation Barrier:
Apartheid Wall:  a fence / wall 8 meters tall being constructed around Palestine.</p>

<p>further reading: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid_wall">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid_wall</a></p>

<p>Intifada: An uprising of Palestinians against the apartheid in which they have been living.  The first Intifada was from 1987 to 1992ish. The second Intifada started in 2000, and is or is not finished depending on who one asks.</p>

<p>=================================
Section Two:  Qalandia Checkpoint</p>

<p>I have been living in Faisal Hostel in Jerusalem.  It&rsquo;s near the Old City of Jerusalem, where Jesus carried the cross before his crucifixion back in the day.</p>

<p>Ramallah is a city about 18 kilometers (11 miles) north of Jerusalem. Ramallah means hill of God.</p>

<p>There is a highway between Ramallah and Jerusalem, which would make the trip take about 15 minutes by car.</p>

<p>However, there is a checkpoint on the highway, through which vehicles may not pass.</p>

<p>To go from Jerusalem to Ramallah, everyone must get out of the vehicle (taxi or bus, unless someone has a friend to drive their personal car away) walk 100 meters past guards and through a one way gate, then secure another vehicle to go the remaining 5 minutes to Ramallah.</p>

<p>To get from Ramallah to Jerusalem, everyone must get out of the vehicle, walk 50 meters, go through a one way gate, through a metal detector, show passport or ID to the soldiers, and then the remaining 50 meters to secure another vehicle on the other side.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s called Qalandia Checkpoint, and rumor has suggested the security could get even tighter on the way from Jerusalem to Ramallah.</p>

<p>==================
Section Three: ISM</p>

<p>ISM stands for International Solidarity Movement.  Their basic idea involves having Internationals come to Palestine to stand with Palestinians during the riotous Intifada.  Because the Intifada is no longer riotous, and many &ldquo;hard core&rdquo; ISMers have been blacklisted and cannot return to the country, ISM will reformulate itself after this year&rsquo;s olive harvest.</p>

<p>I came to Palestine with the intention of joining other ISMers in supporting the olive harvest.  At the training, I was surprised at the content of the training.  We spent a great deal of time on topics like protecting ourselves from tear gas, rubber bullets, and sound bombs. We did role plays of de-arresting people by dogpiling a person the soldiers are trying to arrest.  We spent a great deal of time learning about our rights and about the chances of being arrested, what to expect, and what to do in case we are arrested.</p>

<p>At the end, we came to the final question: &ldquo;okay, where do you want to go harvest olives?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I decided I was not ready to put myself into a situation where I might be arrested.  More specifically, I didn&rsquo;t want to be deported without the chance of return.</p>

<p>================================
Section Four: Palestinian Vision</p>

<p>Instead of being an Activist, I have focused on being a writer.  Part of that time has been writing and editing reports and grant requests for Palestinian Vision, an NGO that focuses on empowering Palestinian Youth to help them focus on living instead of being oppressed.</p>

<p>I learned of PalVision semi-directly from my voyage on Peace Boat. Niveen and Eilat were selected by PalVision to sail on Peace Boat and represent youth voices in this conflict.  Niveen&rsquo;s passionate story brought me to Palestine to see for myself what&rsquo;s going on.</p>

<p>====================
Section Five: Bil&rsquo;in</p>

<p>Residents of a village called Bil&rsquo;in gather every Friday (the first day of their weekend) to peacefully protest construction of a wall that (once completed) will separate the village from 60% of its farmland, which will be given to the nearby Israeli settlement.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been to this demonstration twice, not as an active participant, but as a photographer and videographer.  Each week, approximately the same thing happened: soldiers stood in full riot gear at the top of a hill while villagers and at least as many internationals chanted in Arabic and held signs.  I was one of many recording the event, basically ignored by everyone involved.</p>

<p>After the chanting, the demonstration splits up into people who go home, and people who spread out over the land.  The soldiers spread out with them.  Some people (who may be a villagers or may be Israeli sympathetic and trying to stir up trouble) throw rocks at the soldiers who wait for a bit and then shoot rubber bullets and tear gas at the rock throwers.</p>

<p>The first time I attended (two weeks ago), I tried to stay well away from the conflict, but at one point found myself right in the middle of it!  Unfortunately with dead batteries in both my still camera and video camera because I had recorded so much other stuff.  I wasn&rsquo;t hit by anything, but I did get a couple long moments with tear gas.</p>

<p>The second time I attended (last week), I recorded some of the action, and then honestly got rather bored and just sat near the top of the hill near where some soldiers were standing around waiting for instruction.</p>

<p>Suddenly, <em>!<em>WHAM</em>!</em> I felt a shocking blow on my shoulder!  It was more surprising than painful, but had it hit <em>anywhere</em> else on my body, it would have produced serious pain and likely injury.  It struck exactly on the muscle between my neck and shoulder.  Truly thankful, truly blessed, I thanked my angels for the easy lesson.</p>

<p>(it was a stone)</p>

<p>Several soldiers came to ask if I was okay; I assured everyone I was fine.</p>

<p>The week before, a man named Joe was hit by a stone in the stomach. Palestinian doctors repaired his spleen and stapled the incision shut on his abdomen.  He is sitting across from me and showed everyone his scar - about five inches long.</p>

<p>====================</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s enough for one installment.  Blessings and love to all.</p>

<p>This looks pretty cool. I&rsquo;m intrigued by the cargo and crew launching separately, but I guess it makes sense to keep the crew away from the heavier launch thing. It will be interesting to see how they will handle disruptions in launching the second vehicle. If the first one is in orbit and then the second can&rsquo;t be launched, how long can the first one stay in orbit to wait?</p>

<p>I look forward to visiting the moon myself.</p>

<p>I want to see the alien ships on the far side of the moon!</p>

<p>Oh my gosh Flock is getting even cooler!!? And by &ldquo;getting cooler&rdquo; I mean I am discovering more features that have been here all along!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m writing this blog entry <em>without</em> being connected to the internet.? I wrote the one on Patch Adams, and then carefully saved the text so I could close flock and not lose what I wrote, but then when I open it back up&hellip;? the entry is already saved!!!!!</p>

<p>Flock has a local copy of <em>all</em> my blog entries, any of which I can edit and (I imagine) update when I get back online!</p>

<p>Wow!!</p>

<p>Just saw most of Patch Adams starring Robin Williams.? I was surprised when The Girl died; I saw she was going to have an issue, and wondered how it would be resolved.? How could ol&rsquo; Patch say &ldquo;now now; play nice,&rdquo; after the incident, but I guess by killing both involved, it&rsquo;s not an issue.</p>

<p>Kudos to the real Patch Adams for having the courage to be different and silly.</p>

<p>A few minutes after downloading, (given that I&rsquo;ve already got a blog<br />
set up (thanks, Dude!)) I am writing to my blog from flock&rsquo;s<br />
interface. I sure hope they don&rsquo;t abuse my password which I&rsquo;ve given<br />
to my flock browser.</p>

<p>I think I should be able to <em>do things</em> with the blog entries listed<br />
in the flock blog window (like edit the one on flock instead of having<br />
to write this new one), but maybe that&rsquo;s coming soon to a feature list<br />
near you.</p>

<p>((ah!! I found it; I just have to doubleclick to edit the entry))</p>

<p>For the record, this is flock version 0.5pre</p>

<p>Hmmmm. I don&rsquo;t see a way to specify into which category this blog entry is stored.</p>
