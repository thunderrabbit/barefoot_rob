                        <p>(adapted from my note last night to Mark)</p>

<p>I went to a stand-up comedy open mic tonight and ended up doing a set
(my first ever!)</p>

<p>Several jokes went well, a couple did not; one of those is not
recoverable in any way I can think of.</p>

<p>Soness said it was really good that I used contents of the room for
several of my bits.</p>

<p>Well, by the time you can read this online, it will be fixed (unless
you are reading a git repo!), but at the moment, my journal (up to 11
Sep) and Blog (up to 29 Aug) are only online because my setup does not
overwrite all the existing files after Hugo makes the site.</p>

<p>I guess I need to read the docs again.</p>

<h5 id="17-09-friday-13-september-2019-jst">17:09 Friday 13 September 2019 JST</h5>

<p>Okay the best I have figured out so far is that if I put _index.md
files in the subdirectories of my journal/yyyy/mm directories, those
entries show up.</p>

<p>But it was working before without those _index.md files littered
everywhere.  What changed??</p>

<p>Akiko and I went to CoCo&rsquo;s for our language exchange today and she
helped me figure out how the EOS tea business works.</p>

<p>We each ordered drink bar for around 400 yen.  As thanks for her
business support today, I paid for hers.</p>

                        <p>Had an hour lesson with Liliko, during which we double checked the
English for an AI game they are developing.  For some reason they keep
asking for confirmation of stuff on paper but it has gotten to the
point that we would prefer to see the real thing in action in order to
really make sure it&rsquo;s all correct.</p>

<p>Also had a lesson with Azusa, during which we clarified some of her
translation into English, changing the word &ldquo;become&rdquo; into &ldquo;because&rdquo;
and stuff like replacing &ldquo;addition and multiplication are done by
turning the handle outside&rdquo; with &ldquo;to add and multiply numbers, we turn
the handle clockwise,&rdquo; partially because she could not consistently
say &ldquo;multiplication.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It reminds me of the time I was out of time to do my speech in
Japanese, and just read it off the page instead of knowing what I was
saying.</p>

<p>Today might be the last day I can shop at the nearby shop; their last
day is Monday the 23rd.  I may come back on that day to see if prices
are slashed or what.</p>

<p>No students in my 6pm class here.  And my most-common student in next
lesson has called in that he will not attend.  I&rsquo;m gonna use this time
to write a bit.</p>

<p>I had been planning to talk to them about
<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=wtc+7">WTC 7</a> and stuff on the anniversary
of Airplane Day.</p>

<p>No students in my 7pm class&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="20-00">20:00</h5>

<p>One student in 8pm class.</p>

<p>We started the lesson talking about the typhoon and her plans to
practice piano next Sunday for a rehearsal on September 22nd.</p>

<p>Ended up talking about my websites, and I realize why I am so
distracted!</p>

<p>Well, she did the impossible.  Se-chan convinced me that I should sign
up for her MLM selling tea because she had found a superwoman with a
huge network and she would put her into my downline if I sign up
today.</p>

<p>Going over the numbers, I will be paying 9500 yen per month for
basically bottomless tea, and a likely a bunch of chances to practice
Japanese.  Hmm.  Okay I&rsquo;ll do it.</p>

<p>Went to 平塚 station, just one station past 茅ヶ崎 (where I used to
live with Soness) and signed the dotted line with the help of
Se-chan&rsquo;s mom, Tae, who got me sorted out in about 30 minutes.</p>

<p>I have a <em>sense</em> of how this stuff works; I spent a couple years in
Amway before I was like &ldquo;eff this; I ain&rsquo;t doing all the stuff they
do,&rdquo; referring to the rallies and stuff to amp people up to think they
can jet around on jets and jet skis if they sell enough merch.  I mean
it&rsquo;s possible, but it&rsquo;s a hella lot of work.</p>

<p>My ruff plan is to focus on depth, not width.  Talk to people <em>slowly</em>
and <em>honestly</em> and <em>casually</em> about it until I find someone who is
willing to sign up.  Then get their names list and contact alllll of
them.</p>

<p>This is the method I heard went well for whathisname, my upline
Diamond&hellip;  maybe their names were Don and Nancy?</p>

<p>Anyway, one more thing to add to the list of potential income streams.</p>
