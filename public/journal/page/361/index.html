<p>This morning was surprising to me; I expected to be totally
dragging, but I totally woke up early-ish, with the sense of having
had one hugemongous dream all night including problems with my
bicycle, and people at work with me climbing on and cleaning a statue
type thing or some old metal pipes, and climbing on some sand piles,
with the sense that we might not oughta be doing that cause our
climbing disrupted the natural nature of things there.</p>

<p>I woke up to find my light on and flashcards slightly crinkled to
the side of my bed.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I'm leaving for work a bit later than I have on past Saturdays, but
I still will have plenty-ish of time to get ready.</p>

<p>Did not charge my computer last night so my battery is at 18%.</p>

<p>Kicked it with cats from work tonight.  As we were leaving work,
Carla was like, "are you guys going out?" or do you want to go get a
drink or something and I'm like yeah cause I like Carla and wanted to
hang out with her and tell her how genki I think she is with the kids
and maybe get some insight from her on how to *not* do kids' classes
(cause at this point I really don't want to do them) but I only barely
got to do that cause she went to Wara Wara and joined all the other
cats from our work who had already booked over there after work (and
Benny and Ali didn't put all their files away) so... doh.  But it's
cool; I don't need to start any romantic intrigue thing even if it's
not overtly romantic.</p>

<p>I left early (after only 4 mugs of OJ) to take care of myself and
clean my room, which is what I had planned to do tonight anyway.  But,
like janette taught me, I can break any rules that I make and not feel
guilty.</p>

<p>My rule right now, that I plan not to break, is that I gotta take a
shower after I get home.  pew!!!</p>

<p>Oh man, those guys are such fucking guys too.  Talkin' about
fucking Japanese women "it's not making love, it's fucking" and all
this like crude-ish language that I'm just not embracing at this point
in my life.  Plus, some of them are married.  And I'm not necessarily
talking about the women they're apparently shagging.</p>

<p>Eek.</p>

<p>I wondered during one of my lessons (yesterday?) what it could be
like if I got jiggy with a student, and I realized..  I was like,
"okay, what would it be like right now if I had fucked this girl?"  It
would be SO totally uncomfortable for me and presumably for her to be
in that situation <em>pretending</em> nothing had happened between
us..  how can some of the teachers even think about doing that?  Well,
I know how, but damn, that would be so fucked up.</p>

<p class=date>9:58pm</p>

<p>Oh man.</p>

<p>So, I took a shower, but now I've been reading National Geographic
for an hour instead of cleaning my room.  And now I seem to be on the
computer instead of cleaning my room.</p>

<p>I also seem to have eaten 6 baby KitKat bars.  Part of me wanted to
save half of them for tomorrow, but most of me didn't.  Or at least
not the part that controls my hands and mouth.</p>

<p>I hope Eminem had a good show tonight.  Full of inner peace and joy
and some sort of positive growth experience.</p>

<p>I was happy-boy packed with Japanese and now I'm feeling a bit
antsy after talking to Janette; she asked about / encourage me to go
Eminem at least one of the nights and it brought up all the angst I've
been going through over this concert, and I told her what I had
finally decided - not to go, but to remember that I am creating my own
life</p>

<p>Here it is........ there's a part of me that was going to Eminem
concert for his sake.  Like he would care that *I* go to the show,
like somehow I owed it to Eminem to go to the show because I sent him
a card and said I hoped to.  I was smart enough to say "hope to catch
you in Tokyo" instead of "will" because I know it would drive me
bonkers to have given my word and not follow through.  yeah that's how
crazy I am.</p>

<p>ANYWAY, I'm not going to the show because it seems (seems) like
it's not going to be easy to get there on time (show starts 30 minutes
after my work ends, but it's an hour away) and I don't want to fucking
"just call in sick" nor just go late, because I hate going anywhere
late and even if the show won't *actually* start until later, I don't
know just where it is and I don't know if tickets are still available,
nor where to get tickets, nor fucking anything.  so fuck you, concert,
I'm not going to watch.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>In other news, I was given the equivalent of some prepositions
today "on" "under" "to the right of" "left of" "behind" "in front of"
"between"...  I just need to memorize them.  I must say the structure
is simpler in Japanese.  It's time to make some flashcards.</p>

<p>Ayana asked me *again* to look at pictures and say in Japanese "eat
food at library at 2pm" or whatever the picture indicated.</p>

<br>sorry(!)i brought it up when you were happy boy.  i&rsquo;m pretending that it was better for you to spit out your frustration and discuss amongst our ourselves to get it off your chest.<br>
 someone told me once that there are no mistakes.  that whatever we do brings us to where we need to be.  i don&rsquo;t know if i truly believe that, but sometimes it&rsquo;s a comforting thought.</p>

i like that he (i'm thinking that a female would not use those words) wrote "your" instead of "you're". (that's just me being an arrogant jackass)<br>
i wonder who it is.  i bet it's someone who doesn't know you at all.  settle down?  what the hell does that mean? don't be excited? play nintendo?  what?

<p>Met with Hitoshi and his girlfriend tonight.  They seemed nervous,
and claimed to be so.  I was all, "aw man, it's cool; don't be
nervous" and such like that.  I was a bit nervous so I told myself as
well and that helped.</p>

<p>Meeting went well; I told him 2000 yen per hour instead of 3000 per
hour which is what the findateacher.net site said I charged.   That's
cause he's my first private student.</p>

<p>We'll see how it all pans out.</p>

<p>Nice.</p>

<p>Quite a good challenge to find myself in Shinjuku, which Dru says
is the busiest station in the world.</p>

<p>Got to it.  Treating myself well today.  Got my own reclining seat.</p>

<p class=date>11:07am</p>

<p>Pause for a moment in Odawara, which is also available via a line
that goes through Kawasaki.  I wonder oh wow.  The station name for
Odawara is also written in Korean on this sign. I think it's
Korean.</p>

<p class=date>11:10am</p>

<p>Leaving Odawara.</p>

<p>I wonder what would be measurably different if I board this train
in Odawara.</p>

<p class=date>11:21am</p>

<p>Wow.  Two different track guages on the track beside us.</p>

<p class=date>11:37am</p>

<p>Holy shit!   The seats on my train, which I thought were so
permanent and stable, <em>turned around</em> for the return trip.  I
took a picture showing where the different guages merge just past the
station and as I walked back past my train, the seats were facing the
way from which we had just come.</p>

<p>Like Neo in the first Matrix: Woah.</p>

<p>And double woah is my train was the narrow guage.  And triple whoah
is all the beautiful forest and tunnels through which this larger
guage scenic train is climbing.   And quadruple woah is that there are
Japanese businessmen with briefcases and wearingsuits sitting in stony
silence beside me. Like they take this trek every day and are no
longer impressed.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Oooh, that was neat.  The train stopped at a small station and then went
backwards out of the station; the track is basically a bunch of
switchbacks going up the mountain.</p>

<p class=date>11:47pm</p>

<p>I escaped the train.  I've got no idea where I am.  Several people
got off and went down a steep hill, presumably to hotels and hot
springs and such.  Though I want to experience a hot spring, I prefer
to disengage from the crowds.  I'm going this way instead, on a small
trail through the trees, along the tracks.</p>

<p class=date>12:58pm</p>

<p>Breathe.</p>

<p>Basically I'm on top of a tall hill coated in trees.  I expected to
reconnect with the train at the top of the hill, but it seems that I
went far more quickly up than the train could.  I can hear activity
way way down below me, like the Grinch listening to Whoville, except
I'm way happier than the Grinch.</p>

<p>Encountered exactly two people on the path up here.  They were
going down instead of up.  But it seems they must have already hiked
up, since I'm at the top and there's no other way they could
reasonably have gotten here except walk.</p>

<p>Note: next time bring more water.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I love my life!  I just opened my bottle of water and the air
poofed out cause I'm at a higher elevation.  I'm reminded of the time
I went to the grand canyon and bounced <em>carefully(!)</em> on a
similarly over-inflated gallon jug on the icy parking lot!</p>

<p>And now I'm just smiling smiling that I have stories like
that!!!</p>

<p class=date>1:33pm</p>

<p>I just took a nap here on the top of the hill.  Birds sang for me.
Two people walked by without speaking.</p>

<p>I'm now going to contine on this trail, this time down, and
presumably I'll find the train again.</p>

<p class=date>1:56pm</p>

<p>Hmm.  So I wasn't at the top of the mountain. I have ascended
another 50 feet maybe and found myself at a T intersection: straight
and left were my options.  The kanji pointing left seemed more
interesting.  I'm at a sturdy plastic picnic table in a sort of
clearing.</p>

<p class=date>2:14pm</p>

<p>English voices coming up the hill behind me: Rondal, Lyndsey and
another name I forgot.  The guys are serving in the military for 3 and
2 years, respectively.  Lyndsey will be teaching English soon.</p>

<p>We had come from opposite directions and traded descriptions of
what was available.</p>

<p class=date>4:04pm</p>

<p>Whoooooooo</p>

<p>Walk walk walk</p>

<p>I <em>think</em> I know where I am.  If I understand correctly,
I've basically walked across this mountain.  I've come to a two lane
highway thing and I think I'm at a bus stop and I think if I get on
this bus I'll be taken basically back to the beginning of Hakone.  No
one nearby to ask.   The adventure continues!</p>

<p class=date>4:19pm</p>

<p>A bus arrived</p>

<p>Another bus arrived just as I was writing that.  The first bus
arrived and driver said my pass wasn't good for that bus.  I saw a cat
across the street who showed me on a map where we are.  I was
topologically (in terms of roadways) correct (of course) but had
guessed the wrong section of street.</p>

<p>The second bus that just arrived also said that the pass was no
good, and the next bu</p>

<p class=date>4:37pm</p>

<p>And then the *next* bus arrived, interrupting my typing, but it's
cool cause the cat who helped me navigate the buses helped me a bit
with Japanese and made sure I got on the correct bus, *<em>and</em>*
told the driver where I wanted to go.</p>

<p>For some reason (scheduling) we are just chillin' here in the bus
(we = me and the driver on an otherwise empty bus).  My friend is
yammering on his keitai and bid me adeiu in English.</p>

<p class=date>4:40pm</p>

<p>Bus still empty-ish and we're underway.</p>

<p class=date>4:43pm</p>

<p>Nice.  I've been deposited at the bus stop labeled Open Air Museum,
but I'm totally lost now - nothing here looks like what I thought that
might look like.  This is similar to when I got off the bus "near" the
bicycle pound.</p>

<p class=date>4:45pm</p>

<p>Yahooo!!  I found the museum thanks to "Picasso" written on the
sign. I had seen his name associated with museum ads.  The museum was
closed, so I didn't have to waste any time there.  I got some pictures
of a fly water fountain thing.</p>

<p>Hopped on another bus and went "950 meters" to Gora, where we
<em>turned around</em> on a little spinny thing!  wow!  And now.   and
<em>now!!</em> I'm on a cable car that's being pulled up this steeeep
incline.</p>

<p class=date>5:43pm</p>

<p>It just keeps getting better better better.</p>

<p>I was reminded of James Bond movies while in the suspended
gondola.  I had the car all to myself so I rocked it side to side,
causing the two huge cables to oscillate up and down.</p>

<p>The amazing silence pervaded my soul, soothing, invigorating.  Like
floating through outerspace except for the floating part.   A slight
hum sang to me, transmitted through the high tension cables holding my
private gondola.   There's almost nobody here.  I'm SO thankful that I
got lost on the mountain and got away from the crowd.  Now they've all
gone home and left this beautiful park for me to enjoy alone.</p>

<p>Huge.</p>

<p>Beautiful.</p>

<p>But I don't have enough time to continue the trek around Hakone, so
I'm on the way back.  It looked like it might get even *better*.
(More suspended gondolas, but with a view of Mt Fuji!) I'll find out
next time I'm here, no later than September.</p>

<p class=date>6:38pm</p>

<p>And now I'm back on the express train to Shinjuku.  (not the
limited express train on which I arrived (the one with reversable
seats and such) (didn't hurt to try riding it back as well) but
the normal line that any ol' bear can ride.</p>

<p>Cool thing is the train is nearly empty.</p>

<p>Two German women sitting in this same car; I think it's the first
time I've heard German while here.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Overall, I most loved what Lyndsey said when she heard I made
today's trip alone: "you're brave."</p>

<p>Awesome.</p>

                        <p class=date>2:13pm JST Wednesday 21 May 2003</p>

<p>I'm working overtime today; I got called while I was in the
internet cafe.  I coulda turned it down; we never *have* to work
overtime, but I felt like I didn't really have anything better to do
except maybe study Japanese, so I said yes.</p>

<p>I'll be paid 1.5 times my normal rate.  5 classes * 1.5 = 7.5
classes so it's like working almost a full extra day.  I got 1.25
times my rate yesterday (first day of overtime per week) so that's
like working more than a day, though I only really worked 1/2 a day
cause it was so unbusy.</p>

<p>What is the best use of my time?  Why am I here?  For this
incredible experience</p>

<p>Whoah I think I just saw the bicycle rack at Ç´Å≠Ç», so there *is* one
here.  I wonder if it's secure.  Today I parked twice in the secure
dollar per day lot under the um..  wait a minute.  When did I do that?
Um, oh er, oh I'm *going* to park there twice; I parked there once
after class to hit the internet for a bit, got called to do overtime
and I'll park there again on the same 24-hour ticket later tonight or
maybe tomorrow morning depending on my level of tiredness.  We shall
see.</p>

<p>Back to the real question...  wtf am I doing here?  Do I make my
priority working overtime?   Meeting people and engaging the culture.
I'm looking for some hard-and-fast rule on whether or not I "should"
have said yes to the offer of overtime.  As I write "offer" that
suggests it was a good thing, so Yes is appropro (correct usage?).</p>

<p>It's silly that I look for hard and fast rules.  Silly that I am
saying I do something as if it's true.</p>

<p>Bryn once suggested that life is not as black and white as I seemed
to view it during one of our conversations.  I wonder how ol' Bryn is
doing?  I hope she's well and happy in London.</p>

<p>I am here for the experience.   I'm here for the same reason that I
believe we are here on earth.  For the experience.  Whatever I do is
the right thing to do.  I just suggest that I pay attention to what
I'm doing - that I experience my life fully, even if I sometimes feel
like I'm not wrestling from life every possible experience I *could*
experience.</p>

<p>Just be; just live in the moment, moment to moment.  Supa zen
like.</p>

<p>heehee the cat across the train from me is making typing motions
and talking to his wife.   A moment ago I sat when someone got up and
then an older woman stood near me so I conceded my seat to her.  I
practiced standing in tadasana, not using the oh shit handle for
balance.  When the seat beside her came available, someone across the
aisle pointed it out to me.  My seat.  Nice.</p>

<p>I don't know how many more stops to go.  Maybe 2 or 3 I think.
Never been to this station before.  Oops I forgot the name.  I hope
I'll know it when I see it.</p>

<p>Ah. Ç©Å›Å®Å§Ç©</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class=date>9:31pm</p>

<p>Done.  Basically fun.  One class was like pulling teeth, another
like pulling taffy.  Laffy taffy.</p>

<p>I might go to ÅÕÇ±ÅÀ tomorrow.  Might not.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Wait.  I *did* park my bike twice in the same lot already.  Once
when I went to the cafe the first time, and then again after I went to
my apartment to change to work clothes.  I rode back to Å¬Ç»ÇµÅ‹ so
I could internet again tonight when I get back.  Soon.</p>

<p>Wheee</p>

<p>A second potential student has nearly contacted me.   This one gave
email address and phone number.  I emailed tonight and will call
tomorrow unless I hear back tonight.</p>

<p>A possible student sent me their phone number, but when I called
it, the call wouldn't go through.  According to the employee here at
the cafe, it's either a wrong number or maybe the person has used the
equivalent of a spam blocker on the phone.</p>

<p>Gotta give me the correct number or turn off spam block before I
can call you, jack.</p>
