<p>I&rsquo;m in a hotel near Narita airport because my flight for Perth leaves
at 9am tomorrow.  I wish the shuttle left a bit earlier, but I guess
it will be okay to arrive by 7am.  6:45 prolly.</p>

ass just as her train arrived. He tried to run so I grabbed him and
brought him back to her. She was like thank you and got on the train!

ass. so I yelled at him and let him go, never to see her again and
a bunch people wondering wtf crazy barefoot mf yelling

<p class="dream"> We watched as two security guards dove into the
river to help the tourists who had fallen out of the rafts.  The river
water came right up to the window, which surprised me, but was normal
to the locals.  We started climbing down the tower and walking towards
the rocket to launch to the mon.  I was like oh snap I forgot to pack!
I realized I did not have to panick; I manifested the packed bag in my
hands by visualizing what needed to be in it.  This action woke me
into waking reality but I went back to sleep.  Walking along the path
with my new friend, we saw one of her friends who gave me doe eyes
when we met. Nice to meet you and hug and kiss with the idea of more
to come.</p>

<p class="dream">Seeing the map of the town and the friendly history,
I just started crying, "I wish I had found you 3 years ago."</p>

<p>Worked at NB on Tuesday, my first lesson there that only lasted 1
hour.  Boo.  It was okay going all the way there for 2 hours, but just
for 1 hour kinda sucks.  I hope we can work out something else, like
maybe they buy lunch as well.</p>

<p>On Monday I got my bag back from ML, where I had left it the previous
week while substituting on the 7th floor.  I found out then that they
have a show room and after I got my bag, I went to it.  They have a
lock which can be reset with one key and relocked with any 1 of
another set of keys, which then becomes the only key which can unlock
it (except the reset key, of course).  The keys had grooves running
along the face, instead of just dimples.</p>

<p>The reset key&rsquo;s grooves looked a bit random, so I guess it is keyed to
that specific lock and not a super great grand master key that resets
any of those kind of locks (of course).</p>

<p class="dream">I was a little bit confused on the train as it went through a tunnel, I realized the train was different than other trains.  It was longer, like one continuous car as it snaked along the route.  The seat next to me was available, so I patted on it to invite the guy sitting on the other side of the empty seat to sit closer.  He ignored me, but I had made the offer, so that was good enough.</p>

<p class="dream">In the train station, I realized it was a little different because we had arrived at 3F instead of 2F.  I was hungry so went to a shop.  I wanted to get something a bit healthy so I settled on a tuna sandwich with wheat bread.  One of the cashiers was checking out a customer, so I took the sandwich to the other cashier, and then realized she wasn't a cashier because she wasn't wearing a uniform.  She assured me my initial guess was correct: she *was* a cashier and was happy to help.</p>

<p class="dream">I didn't have any money, so I used an 1/8th of the tuna sandwich.  I gave it to her and she placed it on a scale.  It was worth twice what the sandwich had cost, so I was like "d'oh! I over estimated." I wondered if she would give me half of the 1/8th back, or give me currency back.</p>

<p>In waking reality, Lin woke up to let Jennie inside which woke me up
and I realized the dream was interesting enough to jot down.</p>

<p>To be honest, this is taking longer than even I expected.  I need to
plan ahead a bit better to put characters where the need to be to glue
stuff down, etc.</p>

<p>Tonight the co-gender group had its first meeting after our initial 8
meetings.  Two new people came and seemed keen enough that they will
attend again.  I did a process which helped people see the value of
emotional clearing work:</p>

<pre><code>Feeling: anger at my wife because she buys crap she won't use for long
Anger source: helpless, feeling sadness that consumerism is polluting earth
Feel sadness where: actually not in my body, like it's out in front of
   me, like I have lost touch with my groundedness
How to regain groundedness: go climb a tree, reconnect with nature
</code></pre>

<p>So to recap, my anger at my wife is really hiding sadness about my own
disconnect from nature.</p>
