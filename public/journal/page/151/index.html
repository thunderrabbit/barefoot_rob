<p>Yay!  We&rsquo;ve officially been approved for a loan to buy the house we
found in 百合ケ丘.  I&rsquo;m glad because the kanji isn&rsquo;t particularly

<p>Okay so I&rsquo;m trying to post a sad+funny thing about IBM customer
service.  I took a screenshot of the email they sent and opened my
screenshot directory in Finder.</p>

<p>or <em>tried</em> to open the directory in Finder, but it just showed the
loading gif and didn&rsquo;t load the directory contents.</p>

<p>So I force-quit Finder and it quit, but now will not reload.</p>

<ul>
<li>CPU is at 7% usage.</li>
<li>Hard drive has 13 Gigs available.</li>

<li><p>uptime is 17 days</p>

<p>$ uptime
9:53  up 17 days, 15:20, 3 users, load averages: 2.31 2.37 2.31</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Everything seems to be responding fine except Finder.</p>

<p>sigh</p>

<p>rebooting my machine now.</p>

<h2 id="10-04">10:04</h2>

<p>Okay, at least I know <em>why</em> it was happening.  I had stopped hitting
Cancel on a series of modal popup windows requesting access to my
keychain.  Skype and Messages and a bunch of apps that I don&rsquo;t always
want to have access were repeatedly asking for it.  Anyway, it&rsquo;s a
modal dialog in that it blocks Finder from doing anything else.  I had
just shoved it off to the side to get it out of my way.</p>

<p>After closing all my other windows, I saw it down there. gah fucking
hell</p>

<p>A few days ago I was excited to see IBM encouraging blockchain
technology.  It&rsquo;s new uncharted territory in my mind so I thought hey
cool some big players are encouraging it.</p>

<p>I tried to sign up for their service and was spooked by their password
restrictions.  Only 31 characters, and no &lsquo;special&rsquo; characters.</p>

<p><a href="//b.robnugen.com/journal/2016/ibm_password/crappy_password_limitations_2016-02-17_at_8.15.09_PM.png"><img src="//b.robnugen.com/journal/2016/ibm_password/thumbs/crappy_password_limitations_2016-02-17_at_8.15.09_PM.png" alt="crappy password limitations 2016-02-17 at 8.15.09 PM" /></a></p>

<p>So I wrote them a little email:</p>

<pre><code>only 31 character passwords?

Why can't I use %^#$%#% as my password?   Or better yet 100 randomized characters?  Why only 31 characters?

I was attracted to Blockchain as a Service, but am running scared from your password limitations.

But good luck with it; thank you for posting the code as well.

<p>I got their response today.</p>

<p><a href="//b.robnugen.com/journal/2016/ibm_password/crappy_ticket_response_2016-02-21_at_9.39.05_AM.png"><img src="//b.robnugen.com/journal/2016/ibm_password/thumbs/crappy_ticket_response_2016-02-21_at_9.39.05_AM.png" alt="crappy ticket response 2016-02-21 at 9.39.05 AM" /></a></p>

<p>In addition to its errors, there is no answer to my main question.</p>

<p>So I submitted feedback</p>

<p><a href="//b.robnugen.com/journal/2016/ibm_password/feedback_2016-02-21_at_1.48.34_PM.png"><img src="//b.robnugen.com/journal/2016/ibm_password/thumbs/feedback_2016-02-21_at_1.48.34_PM.png" alt="feedback 2016-02-21 at 1.48.34 PM" /></a></p>

<div class="dream">
Arrived at a hedge where I needed to climb up to meet my peps, but two
people were waiting to come down, so I invited them to come down first
before I climbed.  I wasn't sure how they had been standing on the top
of the bushy trees, but after I climbed up using a horizontal branch
fork to press up and climb up from there, I found the top of the
bushes had been covered in a raft of logs.  Very convenient!  There
were some kids playing in the next zone of toys and Fred was there so
I joined them and kicked a ball into the fray and hit a kid in the
face.  He was like "wha?" and didn't cry when he saw me apologized for
it.  We played dodge ball soccer and the ultimate team wa playing real
soccer next door, laughing at me when I couldn't kick the ball
properly.  I basically ignored them and focused on playing.  Fred and
I were playing against three other players, using a few different
balls.  The other players had a home made lighter-air pump and they
used that to inflate the balls.  The bigger kid came over and
explained that's what it was in case anyone ame over asking questions,
because it apparenly looked suspicious.  Balls inflated quickly and
the kid jumped on the last ball to finish its inflation.  I heard a
popping noise and thought he had burst the ball, but it was inflated
so hmm I guess not.

<p>yesterday Lin and I applied for a bank loan to buy our new house!  The
negative interest rates hadn&rsquo;t trickled down yet apparently, but we&rsquo;ll
see what kinda rate we are offered.  I think I heard the real estate
guy say 0.77% which I guess is reasonable.</p>

<p>After applying, we went through the house and too measurements of
every room.</p>

<p>Afterward, I headed to work from new station (we&rsquo;re 22 minutes&rsquo; walk
from 新百合ケ丘)..  83 minutes on three train lines to work.  yay!???
I&rsquo;ve determined to use this time to draw pictures.</p>

<p>Today at 9:30, I&rsquo;m substitute teaching <del>6</del> <ins>9</ins>
students who are apparently up-n-coming stars or at least wannabe
stars.  There&rsquo;s a non zero chance I might teach them again; we shall
see!</p>

<p>I just need to stay awake until then!  (I&rsquo;m in a nearby convenience store.)</p>

<hr />

<p>The class was fun!  Their band is
<a href="https://silent-siren.com/en/">Silent Siren</a>; we did an
adjective-opposites game and then practiced English phrases they can
use on stage.</p>

<p>Afterward, I received two chocolate valentines, including a homemade
cookie!</p>
