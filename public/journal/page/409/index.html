<p>We ate spaghetti dinner late.  Tanner and Joel sang in barber shop
quartet style this song:</p>

<pre>
(something about spaghetti dinner)
</pre>

<p>Quite cute and quite bad; they must have gotten stage fright cause
they sounded great while practicing in Josephine's room.</p>

<p>"Wow!  It's after midnight" seemed to be the general exclamation
after dinner.</p>

<p>Janette and I are watching The Dead Zone now.</p>

<p class=date>7:56pm</p>

<p>It was cute.  "Like an HBO movie," says Janette.</p>

<p>"Like a kids' after school special."</p>

<p>Hahahaah</p>

<p>Best part was at the very end, after the closing credits, the name
PILLAR with the first L backwards, had the two L's alternately
arguing:</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Pause, "you're grounded."</p>

<p>Just played Apples to Apples with several cats like Laura, Tyler,
Jack, Natalie, Casey, Sally, Richard, Amelia, me.  I learned that Mark
Twain is a good trump card for Jack.  I almost played it once on him
before I knew he'd probably go for it.</p>

<p>However, for most of the game, I had a bunch of stupid People
Cards, which don't usually do well in the game.  The game ended as I
started to get some good trump cards like The Universe, and something
else.</p>

<p>Big time dancin' in the morning after Wave One of cleanup was
complete-ish.  Richard, Laura, Heather and I throwin' down some funky
moves (and by funky I mean wiggidy wack), but the funniest was when I
started doing a variant of the Ants and Cheese dance for about 16
beats and then Laura blurts in a snotty manner, "okay <b>that's</b>
just <em>weird.</em>"  I fell to the floor laughing. (she was joking)</p>

<p>I was alone on the dance floor (created by moving the table over in
the kitchen) to Michael Jackson's <em>Thriller</em> when the music
suddenly stopped.  I kept dancing; I was doing some twisted looking
broken dance as he was talking about the monster getting ahold of you
or something, and I didn't want to let a break in the music to break
my flow, but I certainly wondered why Meg was moved to turn off the
music.</p>

<p>Turns out the power went out, well, the breaker braked without a
doubt. I went outside to turn it on and it broke again while Asha was
on, writing a LJ entry, listening to Freshmen by Vervepipe.  "I hate
when that happens.."</p>

<p>Janette is magically mass producing breakfast for carnivores,
omnivores, vegivores, and vegans simultaneously.  Natalie is sitting
quietly in a chair, eating a tortilla.  Even with all four, five of us
crazy on the dance floor, we couldn't get her up.</p>

<p>Jack is dispensing silliness sometimes jerkily to his friends, but
I know he secretly loves them all.</p>

<p>Sally and Richard (not my Sally, Richard's Sally, and by his Sally
I mean his sister) arrived around 3:30am, but David from Dallas got
them beat by arriving around 7am.</p>

<p>An old traffic cone arrived in the kitchen apparently from the lake
last night.</p>

<p>* me telling the story about how I "forgot Joan's name" when I didn't
recognize her on David Johnston's shoulders at Tulsa and Elizabeth had
been all, "you don't know anyone's name without Bryn!!"</p>

<p>* "You want some milk on your back?" asks Laura as Richard
continued to block her way out of the kitchen.</p>

<p>* David from Irving wearing a Chinese Happy Coat as he and his
peeps had intentions to resume filming their <em>Twenty Minutes of
Kung Fu</em>, the filming of which had been interrupted after 22
seconds when one of the actresses cracked her head open on a column in
the hotel.</p>

<p>* Bryn is online!</p>

<p>Just watched <em>Roger and Me</em>, Michael Moore's first
documentary, the one where he hadn't yet made business cards, and was
unable to speak to the spokesperson of a plant on its last day of
operation.</p>

<p>I'm impressed with his tenacity in dealing with people.</p>

<p>I'm glad that Flint spent millions of dollars attempting to bring
in tourists before resorting to building a prison to keep up with all
the crime resulting from the lack of employement.</p>

<p>Played disc out at the park with those who like to play such games.
First hotbox with Mikey describing the game to us: (Tanner, Ryan,
Matt, me, Joel), then ultimate with basically the same group +
Richard.</p>

<p>Janette and the girls came and mostly watched and took pictures.
They didn't want to play.</p>

<p>Josephine helped me with dishes by drying those that I washed and
rinsed.  I'm thankful for her help.  I asked Janette not to help,
which she found difficult.  As difficult as getting Joey to help,
maybe..</p>

<p>I'm really thankful for the space that Janette has created here,
allowing everyone to hang out in a safe, fun, loving environment.  I'm
specifically thankful that she allows me to just be here in this
space, paying only by doing odd jobs around the house.  Such a
wonderful vacation from work that I'm having!</p>

<p>Part of me is falling in love with her, but I dare not write that
here!</p>

<p>Also, the screen on my laptop seems to be flaking.  All the pixels
are fine, but the backlight sometimes doesn't.</p>

<p>Once all the kittens started waking up, starting with Meg or maybe
Hillary and finishing with Amelia, we all went down to the park to
play disc and chill (leaving Colleen behind; she didn't want to get up
yet).  At the park, Tanner, Paul, Amelia and I tossed discs around for
a while, and the others sat and chilled in the sun talking or swinging
on the swings.</p>

<p>The wind blew the discs everywhere; really funny when Tanner and
then Amelia each tried to throw into the wind and the disc was blown
rolling right back to them.</p>

<p>Played follow the leader with Tanner as leader and Paul behind me
on the playground equipment, and ended up with Tanner swinging and me
on his lap to win the game.</p>

<p>Later I was able to stand on the swing and pull myself up onto the
top of the swingset.</p>

<p>Tanner and Paul threw some discs to me, some of which I was able to
catch while standing up there.  I lost my balance while walking across
and had to jump down.  That's the first time that's happened in a
while...</p>

<p>Later I was able to switch from swing to swing basically while
seated and then (after one missed attempt) climb up the swingset pole
to the top of the swingset.</p>

<p>Janette and Colleen joined us after a while; I swang beside Colleen
and played bumper swings with her a bit.</p>

<p>But the coolest thing of all: Paul swinging and Tanner jumping onto
his back grabbing the chains and was able to hang on for a couple of
oscillations.  Quite amazing!  I don't know if anyone got a picture of
it, but there were a few cameras there (Celeste, Joan, Meg, me)</p>

<p>When Tanner, Paul and I started playing hackey sack, everyone else
left.</p>

<p>Paul did some pretty phat tricks, and was all modest about his
skillz.  He was all "I wonder if you can hit it with the sole of your
foot..." and withing 2 minutes he did it, getting 4 hits in a row on
the sole of his shoe.</p>

<p>We considered making a hackey sack movie, including elements from
The Matrix and West Side Story-esque street fighting but with hackey
sacks.  One scene would show the top of some cat walking all weird,
and then the camera pans down to see he's walking and hacking at the
same time.  Another scene has a guy juggling three sacks with his
feet.  Another includes a slow motion of someone really eating it to
dive for the sack.  Another has the sack like 90 feet in the air,
coming down and one cat goes to kick for it and just kicks the dirt
hard and knocks dirt into the eyes of all 30 people in the circle.
Then we cut to a scene of Bryn at SWUUSI, "and you can't kick dirt!"
Oh, and another scene shows a guy in a chicken outfit, pimping his
restaurant, wearing a signboard thing, seeing us, then coming over to
play and showing us all up by kicking all the phat moves while wearing
the chicken outfit.  Beak stalls, toe stalls on each successive toe
(big chicken feet), tailfeather stalls.. everything.</p>

<p>A mom and two kids came to the swings and the littler kid somehow
fell off the swing and started crying.  The some kids came with an
equally little kid and somehow one of the kids ended up falling on top
of the little kid, causing him to cry.</p>

<p>"Is it time for us to go?"</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>This morning I worked on installing gimp on my system.  I had
already downloaded gimp-1.2.3, and it says I need gtk.  So I
downloaded gtk+-1.2.10 and it says I need glib.  So I downloaded
glib-1.2.10 and it says I need to specify a host type when I tried to
install it.  I'm getting closer!</p>
