<p><strong>6:42am Thursday 9 May 2013</strong></p>

<p><em>I was in a small room, controlled by the government that was a bit like prison but not completely terrible conditions and it was time for alien disclosure but they were doing it in a very specific way. Some spider webs were in my room in the corner, and there was a pillow but nothing else. I was asked to lie face down with pillow ofer my head and to cover my ears as the aliens were revealed and each person could be shwon the aliens under supeision and not get freaked out. I was already not freaked out and planned to not cover my ears and couldn&rsquo;t lie face down because under pillow plus face down meant I couldn&rsquo;t breathe. I lay down face up with the pillow like a dome over my head and covered my ears fakely so I could hear but it looked like I was covering. I could hear the guy talking to the alien and he goes, &ldquo;face up?&rdquo; because the alien apparently ratted on me and he checked me and I was like yeah I can&rsquo;t breathe otherwise. He confirmed I coudln&rsquo;t see anything and allowed it.</em></p>

<p>_
Eventually I wa able to see the aliens, starting with seeing them out in the yard, and was a bt curious to see they loked like very large rats. Each prson outside was assigned an alient partner, and the humans were treated them ike pets, which the aliens were allowing s they knew we just needed to get it out of our system. I was determined to treat mine more respectfully so when I was assigned my alien I immediately asked if I could learn their language. I had a large book with alien symbols (looking something like Thai writing, but with a lot more space inside and between the letters). I was talking to my alien partner and asking questions about why it seemed to take so long and why go about disclosure in this way and the reply was this is how our government wanted it and how the people seemed ready for it. I explained that we each had the ability to think without the government so they could have asked us individually. He said they had, but we didn&rsquo;t hear them. Hmmmm._</p>

                        <p>##19:27 Wednesday 08 May 2013</p>

<p><strong>7:10pm Wednesday 8 May 2013</strong></p>

<p>I was thinking recently how I didn&rsquo;t use <a href="https://brian.io/lawnchair/">lawnchair</a> to keep track of which items were on a page when coming back to it.</p>

<p>But today I did use lawnchair for a different thing, mostly because I was already using lawnchair for a similar issue.  There&rsquo;s a page which uses <a href="https://datatables.net/">Datatables</a> to display lists of units in the system.  When clicking to view a particular unit, there are previous and next buttons on the page.  Lawnchair keeps a big-ass list of all the unit ids so it knows which is the previous and which is the next.  I know there&rsquo;s some <del>optimation</del> optimization to be done here, but haven&rsquo;t figured out how yet.</p>

<p>A long time ago, a request was made by the client to select all the records in the list.  This needed to be backed by the database (<code>users_2_selections</code>) and I couldn&rsquo;t figure a good way to &ldquo;re-search&rdquo; the units according to what search parameters were just done.  I told them &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a really hard problem&rdquo; and put it off for months.</p>

<p>THEN, today, when looking at a different request, I realized that selecting all the records in the list could solve it (more easily than another way to solve it).  So I re-visited this problem and realized &ldquo;derp! I have all the unit ids in Lawnchair!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When they click on the thing (what&rsquo;s the word for a span that&rsquo;s not a link and not a button but responds to a click event?), it says &ldquo;hey lawnchair, give me that list of ids!&rdquo; and then ajaxes  &ldquo;hey server, they wanna select all these ids!&rdquo; and the server is like &ldquo;cool&rdquo; and slaps them into the users_2_selections table and all is good.</p>

<p>EXCEPT for one detail: it seems that if there&rsquo;s more than 1000 unit ids, the server doesn&rsquo;t get them all.  I&rsquo;ll have to look at that one later, possibly tomorrow.</p>

<p>dinner time now!</p>

<p><strong>6:43am Wednesday 8 May 2013</strong></p>

<p>This morning I added a score calculator that takes into consideration the number of cards remaining. I figure if only a few cards remain, then it&rsquo;s easier to find the correct one.</p>

<p>It also makes use of prime numbers and floats in an attempt to ensure people do not often get the same high score.</p>

<p><strong>6:38am Wednesday 8 May 2013</strong></p>

<p>Yesterday at work I got the pagination to be ajax driven if javascript is enabled and GET driven if javascript is not enabled.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve started to cut a couple corners as the project is a bit overdue.  For example, instead of figure out how to redisplay the same units when clicking back to the map page (I&rsquo;d probably use Lawnchair), I just open units in a new tab.</p>

<p><em>We had been retreating but I realized it was &ldquo;that place where I can control things&rdquo; so I went toward them firing arrows at me.  I wasn&rsquo;t hit/hurt by any arrows and I got close enough to shoot some of them, but didn&rsquo;t because it wouldn&rsquo;t be nice, so I found an old cave where we had had a school or something and went down into it and turned right behind an old saloon that was filled with chairs and stuff.  I leapt up to the second floor balcony and was able to move some plywood out of the way so I could close the shutters and wait there for the war to be over.</em></p>

<p><strong>9:55pm Monday 6 May 2013</strong></p>

<p>The first few apps we made were all separate projects.  The apps were all similar, so I had a huge mess of code for making updates.  Specs were all confuzzed in my head; code was all over the place, possibly changed, possibly not.  Basically making updates wasn&rsquo;t fun.</p>

<p>The most recent app started its life as a mess of blocks, which confuzzed iOS enough to keep crashing the app.  I rewrote the whole thing using Matt&rsquo;s suggestion that the object instantiation look like a tree, not spaghetti.   The code was lovely and the app is pretty much finished but we&rsquo;re going to wait for Tariq&rsquo;s company iOS dev account to be created before we submit it.</p>

<p>However, the next app will be something like this app plus xyz, so I looked up on SO how to do it and came up with a github repo that shows <a href="https://github.com/brennanMKE/MultipleTargets">multiple targets in xcode</a>.  Thanks, Brennan!</p>

<p>So now one target does pronunciation practice then listening practice, while the other jumps straight into listening practice.  Yay!!</p>

<p><strong>7:55pm Sunday 5 May 2013</strong></p>

<p>Today I went to Yodobashi Camera to buy a camera, but I wanted to confirm that it would work with my computer before purchase.  They didn&rsquo;t seem to have <em>any</em> web cameras out of their boxes, so I figured I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to test one before buying.</p>

<p>Rather than try banging my proverbial head against the unbendable rules, I went to Bic Camera to see if they had cameras I could use.  They did; it worked as I hoped,<em>and</em> they were less expensive than at Yodobashi.</p>

<p>I bought a cute little camera for 1980 yen and today, officially started working on Marble Track 3.</p>

<p>I had built a tripod for my waterproof camera, but I couldn&rsquo;t get the camera to work with FrameByFrame, nor with iStopMotion.   I needed a bit taller tripod for this camera, so augmented it with some chopsticks and got started making my movie.  Nice to be making stop motion animation again!</p>

<p>Finished 350 photos in about 3 or 4 hours.  They included a guy coming onto the set, motioning Rabby to pull the marble track base onto the set, and then adding 8 pairs of popsicle sticks to the track.  Nice!</p>

<p>Showed Lin and she was like &ldquo;yay!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then clicked save and FrameByFrame crashed after saving 50 of my 350 photos.</p>

<p>Sigh.</p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;ll buy iStopMotion, assuming I can find no reviews claiming that it crashes a lot.</p>

<p><del>Here&rsquo;s my setup and the first 15% of the images I had taken.</del></p>

<p>Sigh Wordpress.   Here are some sideways images because wordpress can&rsquo;t rotate images over 2 MB.</p>

<p>This character is one of my favorites.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know anything about the actress, but I like her smile.</p>

<p><strong>~11am Saturday 4 May 2013</strong></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re walking on a gravel road which I&rsquo;m having a bit of pain navigating, especially while I&rsquo;m typing this on my phone.</p>

<p><strong>14:52 Saturday 4 May 2013</strong></p>

<p>We had lunch on a rocky &lsquo;island&rsquo; in the riverbed. A couple of us got wet on the way to the island, me more intentionally than another. After lunch, including lots of community food, I took a little nap, enjoying the warm sun when it was visible between clouds.</p>

<p>Headed back, we didn&rsquo;t use lights in a pretty long tunnel. It seemed pitch black for a bit; I liked that part.</p>

<p>Outside the tunnel (or maybe a different one; there were many), Yuri had us try synchronized jumping for a photo. I don&rsquo;t know if we got a shot with everyone in the air!</p>

<p><strong>16:22 Saturday 4 May 2013</strong></p>

<p>According to Travis&rsquo;s pedometer, he walked 28,000 steps. My pedometer app said 25,000. I kinda trust his more.</p>

<p>The four kanji are the name of the tunnel.  As best I can tell, they mean &ldquo;stone collapse tunnel&rdquo;  <a href="https://translate.google.com/#ja/en/%E7%9F%B3%E5%B4%A9%E9%9A%A7%E9%81%93">石崩隧道</a></p>

<p>water behind a dam was super clear!</p>

<p>There were many fences built along cliffs to keep rocks from entering the road</p>

<p><strong>6:42pm Friday 3 May 2013</strong></p>

<p>Chillin&rsquo; with Travis as Yumi and Lin magic up some yummy dinner (some of which was made by Travis).  Deji may be coming over for dinner or maybe after dinner; Travis wasn&rsquo;t able to tell from Deji&rsquo;s email.</p>

<p>Travis made a 3D maze for me!  It&rsquo;s not quite 3D so much as it&rsquo;s layers of 2D.  It&rsquo;s drawn on a hexaflexagon!!!   He used Haskell to output SVG which he printed then folded the maze. Sweet!!</p>

<p>And now, dinner!!</p>
