<pre>
Wende and I are separating. We are both sad, and
continuing to communicate and stuff as we split up.  

You may know that I have never lived alone (and not
been seriously dating someone) since I got out of high
school.  I'm choosing to live alone and be flat single
and not available for relationship for a while.  (like
a year at very minimum)

We intend to not sell the house right now; one of us
will live in it and the other will be in an apartment.
 It appears that I'll be living in the house, but
that's not clear yet.   For now, we will live as
roommates (I'm in the downstairs bedroom) until we
save up a few dollars so she can move out.

<p>Well, it's done.  It's official.  Wende and I are
broken up.  I am proud of both of us; we both stepped
through our fear and emotions and went to eat dinner
with the gang, given that we were at Maggie and John's
house, and everyone was munching dinner.</p>

<p>I also feel more comfortable with my decision this
time because Maggie was there for it and I saw her
continue to love us both.  I'm thankful for that.</p>

<p>For now, I am living in the guest bedroom, with the
cats.  We'll see how stuff progresses in the
morning.</p>

<p>We are looking for different ways to not sell the
house.  I'll continue to pay for it whether I live
here alone or if Wende lives here alone.  If we both
live here, something may have to be done about the
cats living in my room with me.</p>

<p>Conversations with Higher Self, Take One.</p>

<p>Rob: what is going on?</p>

<p>HS: Well, it depends on the point of view.  From your point of
view, you are in a whirlwind of craziness and don't know where you
are.  You are blinded by the emotions and not trusting that you have a
direction.  From my point of view, you are simply in another life
issue, and have several options to choose.  Some of these options will
allow you to get past this issue; to learn its teachings.  Some
choices will simply put off the issue until later.  You can even
choose to look at it next life time if you want.</p>

<p>Rob: Wow.  Hey, I hear Wende out there.  Should I stop and go say
HI?</p>

<p>HS: Not if you wish to stay in this groove of communication.</p>

<p>Rob: Do you have a recommendation on this issue of whether to
choose Wende or not?</p>

<p>HS: I don't; only you can figure it out..</p>

<p>Rob: I just told her that I love her.  Can I know what love is?</p>

<p>HS: Love is multi-faceted.  On one level, love is an emotion that
results in good feeling chemicals flowing through the body.  On
another level, love is a life path - a set of guiding steps to live
one's life.  Love can help others or help oneself.  Love that helps
oneself will ultimately help others.  Understand that most of all.  If
you love and take care of yourself and do what you need to do for
yourself, then ultimately everyone around you will benefit.</p>

<p>Rob:  What do I think love is?</p>

<p>HS: You think love is sex.  You think that love is a set of actions
that one does in order to love someone.  Effort given toward another
or toward oneself to make things better - to reach a higher spiritual
state.  It's actually more than that.  Love is a 4th dimensional thing
that cannot be expressed, but it does actually <em>exist</em>.  Love
is not just actions or feelings, but love does actually exist.  Love
is the lifeblood of the universe.  Love created all and all is
actually love.</p>

<p>I know that seems confusing; you got on a tangent as I expressed
the thought.  You don't need to understand love at that level in order
to do your work here.  In fact, understanding love at that level is a
little bit like cheating yourself at this level.  You can know love at
that level, and you will probably know love at that level in this
lifetime.  You will definitely know love at that level in your next
lifetime.  And in between lifetimes, of course.</p>

<p>Rob:  I heard you say You, as in me.  How am I
separate than you?</p>

<p>HS: You almost heard it; I have a name; I am an entity that is
always with you (on one level), and will always be able to give you
the right answer at that moment.  Kinda like the woman in the Matrix -
she gives the right information at the right time, but it might not be
<em>the truth</em>.  There are times that you can know the truth, and
times that you ought not.</p>

<p>Rob:  May I know your name?</p>

<p>HS: You will hear my name later today, and if you are listening,
you will notice.  But, Higher Self is fine.  You can call me anything
you wish.</p>

<p>Rob: Cool.  What about telling Maggie that I have fundamental
problem with relationship with Wende?</p>

<p>HS: Do you have a fundamental problem in relationshp with
Wende?</p>

<p>Rob: I don't know.  Kim was saying stuff like it's possible that I
do.</p>

<p>HS: Kim is very wise, but doesn't know everything.  He'll be the
first to tell you that.  Except for me hahahaa, but the concept of a
fundamental problem in a relationship is simply how much trouble do
you want to go through in order to be with someone?  You can go choose
to be in relationship with someone who is totally unavailable, and you
will have difficulty and may end up looking totally deluded in
societies eyes.  You can have a relationship with Madonna, or Maggie,
or Meredith, or Queen Elizabeth, and they are all fine and well, but
some will help you with your life path, and some will not.  Some will
give you good positive overall energy, some will not.</p>

<p>No relationship has a net energy of 0.  In the best relationships,
each partner ends up drawing positive energy from the universe, an
infinite supply of love.  I say each partner no matter what entity
that represents.  Could be a country, could be several people, could
be every person in a family unit.  If the relationship is most
perfect, each individual gains love and positive energy as a
result.</p>

<p>Rob:  And my relationship with Wende?</p>

<p>HS: You are pouring a lot of energy into the lack of sex in the
relationship. You are continually looking to get sex, to get her to be
sexual with you.  This is not going to work the way you intend in the
way you are pursuing it.  It might for a moment, but you are pouring
energy at a black hole of sorts.  The sexual relationship that does
not exist between you and Wende is actually in each of your minds.
You see it as the end all be all most important thing, and Wende sees
it as something that is a necessary part of the relationship, but is
not actually the relationship.</p>

<p>Rob:  And?</p>

<p>HS: Listen.  That is love.  Wende and Maggie interacting in a
positive relationship in which both people are putting energy into the
relationship, and each person is actually getting out of the
relationship more than they put in.  Wende loves Maggie; Maggie loves
Wende.  They both want for one another what is best for one
another.</p>

<p>You interact with Wende at this level on occassion, but it has been
rare lately.  When she gave you space to hang with me, that was an act
of love.  You taking that space was an act of self love - taking care
of yourself.  Ultimately you will find that taking the time to take
care of yourself will bring more love an awesomeness and love into
your life than it take energy out of your life.  This is a concept
that many people can use, but few heed.  Most people are looking
outside of themselves for good vibes, and try to do the right thing
either for other people before taking care of themselves first, or
doing that which seems like the right thing for themselves when
actually they are blocking their own energy from being properly
expressed to the universe.</p>

<p>As people love themselves, they become conduits for universal love.
You are walking into a trap with the way you are in relationship with
Wende.  The sex will ultimately get worse; you will cheat on her; you
guys will be divorced in about 5 years or extremely sad in the
relationship.</p>

<p>You must take time for yourself.  A year is a good start.  From
that point of view, you will be more able to see who you are, to see
how you can be a conduit for love in the universe.  You will have a
great ability to communicate with me (if you keep practicing), and
your life will be eschelons better than where you perceive it to be
now.</p>

<p>Rob: What must I do?  What do you mean live alone?  How alone?  No
girls at all?</p>

<p>HS: You don't think you can live without sex from another woman, or
the internet which is actually sex within your own mind and definitely
part of perpetuating your addiction.  Living alone does not mean
living without sex, but from your point of view, right now, it does.
In order to meet yourself, you must recover from sex addiction.  That
thought you had just now about sending this to Cindy is a sex
addiction thought.  You are hoping that she will keep herself
available for you, which really would stunt her spiritual growth if
she did it.</p>

<p>So back to the point - right now, you have to be non-sexual.  Go
through the withdrawal.  go through the 12 steps.  it will be the
hardest thing you think you have <em>ever</em> done.  And it will be
if you think of it that way.  You have the option, however, to find
great support in 12 step meetings.  You have a great understanding of
the calibre of work that must be done.  You <em>can</em> do it.  You
can do it.</p>

<p>To get the relationship with yourself that you want, and the
relationship with a woman that you want, you must do the work first.
No other way around it.  I will be right here with you to help you
heal and pereceive the emotions and cry and all the stuff that is
necessary.  Just like you healed yourself from skating accident, you
can take a fast track on sex addiction healing, but it won't seem as
fast when you are in it.  It will seem to take forever and you'll want
to quit, but you can do it.  You can do it.</p>

<p>Ironic, isn't
it. [Maggie on the phone to someone saying that Rob is choosing to grow up and work on the relationship]
The growing up that she is describing you don't have to go through.
Not in quite the way she is thinking.  You are going through a process
that is grander and more loving than simply a hardening into becoming
an adult.</p>

<p>Rob:  What do I do right now?</p>

<p>Go out there; be yourself.  Tell them you are not sure again; tell
them the truth.</p>

<p>Wende came with me to ultimate today!  That was the
best part about the whole adventure.  She and I were
at Maggie and John's house, and she decided to come
watch!</p>

<p>As we entered the field, we met Dahli (sp), a girl
who was coming to play for a team that didn't have
enough women on the team.  Turns out, she was playing
for Fluff, the team that I'm on!  Best part about that
whole thing is that she's great and helped us win the
game; I know she personally caught 2 points.  I threw
one of them to her.  At the end, when we won, I was
like, that's it!  We did it!  And she was all, "that's
it?"  yup.</p>

<p>One of their women twisted her ankle; putting her
out of the game.  So again, actually; it was a game in
which we won partially because they weren't fielding
enough people.  Our chant at the end recognized
this:</p>

<p>Last we the games were moated off
<br>The name of your team is Voted Off
<br>Our name is Fluff
<br>We would have been stuffed
<br>But one of your players was toted off</p>

<p>Nice!</p>

<p>After the game, I ran around with Scout, Molly and
Will's dog for a bit, and then Maggie came to pick up
Wende so I could use the truck and go meet with <a
href="https://www.thewealthsource.com/index_2.html">Kim
Sawyer</a>, my personal coach.  He gave me a lot to
think about.</p>

<p>Highly productive day in terms of focus on work,
but not so much real headway it seems.  I got a lot of
stuff written so it's working correctly, but I wanted
to be at this point yesterday morning.  It's all good
though.</p>

<p>Karla pored over a buncha emails and collected all
the loose ends - unanswered questions that must be
answered, questions' answers that must be implemented.
Stuff like that.</p>

<p>Wende and I are going on a date tonight.  Should be
a lot of fun.</p>

<p>I heard two parody songs: "50 Ways to Get Bin
Laden" and "Day-O" (is that the name?) with "Taliban"
replacing "Tallyman" and lots of lyrics about warring
with them.</p>

<p>Okay bye.</p>

<p class=note>(4am dream) </p></p>

<p class=dream>In a bus station, sitting with a bunch of passengers, a
man started performing on violin</p>

<p class=note>(we interrupt this dream for a special news bulletin:)
<br>At 1am Molly called and announced her water had broken and they
were off to the hospital; recently she was dilated to 4 cm.  No
official announcement past that.</p>

<p class=dream>The man announced he would play... what's the word
making it up as he goes.  freestyle... ..</p>

<p class=dream>He performed a strumming/bowing thing, and then had
both bows playing at the same time; one on each side of the strings -
one holding the violin up and the other on top.  It sounded really
incredible.</p>

<p>Then he performed on piano, starting with a variation of Dueling
Banjos and then something that included working his way down the
entire keyboard, with all the main keys pressed (not the sharps and
flats) in each section at a time.  Sounded great and amazing.</p>

<p class=dream>When he finished, everyone crowded around; wanted to
ask questions, get his autograph, or photo.</p>

<p class=note>(7am dream)</p>

<p class=dream>Watching <em>Pulp Fiction</em> and at the end of the
movie was a Nine Inch Nails produced advertising thing, which had
repetitious video images, disparate and each confusing in its own
right.  I suddenly noticed a prediction (as the video had been
released in 1990-something) about the WTC crash.  It said something like</p>

<p class=note>OI September II destruction of major building</p>

<p class=dream>or something, and I suddenly recognized the
significance and yelled "hey, come look at this!!" to everyone who was
nearby.  They came to look, but the cycle of images had moved on, and
I assured them it would repeat in a moment.</p>

<p class=dream>It didn't.  Just when it was time for this image to
come back, it flipped to a different set.  "Hey!!  It's different this
time!"  and I tried to rewind it, but the people watching started to
yell, "hey leave it alone," and I tried to explain my actions and I
accidentally turned off the video altogether.  I didn't mean to do
that, I explained.</p>

<p class=dream>Then I went outside to the ending of a YRUU event and
was talking to people about the US bolstering its train mass-transit
system and was about to make an announcement to anyone who owned Pulp
Fiction on video to watch the very end and see the mystery message
when someone said, "hey your mom was looking for you."</p>

<p class=dream>So I walked in, rolling my one car tire (no wheel (no
car)) that I had found and leaned it gently against the wall.  Said HI
to my mom, who I didn't mean to keep waiting for so long and before
she could say anything I woke up.</p>

<p>Haven't really been in the mood to write.  Not even writing letters
lately, nor email.  Doing a lot of personal work; getting the sadness
out, experiencing it as needed.</p>

<p>My Higher Self suggested that I cry each night.  Or at least be
aware of my emotions as well as I can.</p>

<p>Sometimes it's hard.  Uncomfortable to just sit and be still with
myself.  Like Alanis' song "Isn't it ironic" reference to Silence.
Oookey.</p>

<p>One step at a time.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p></p>

<p class=dream>Outside near a railroad track an a highway, I was
working on my program for work, and as a diversion, I found that I
could control the trains on the railroad track by turning a handle
thing on a post sticking out of the ground near my table.  I made the
cars roll toward the highway and timed them so they were crossing
traffic without hitting anything.  Then I stopped one in the median of
the divided highway.</p>

<p class=dream>Then I cranked it the other way and rolled the train
car back toward where it had started and suddenly to my horror, there
was a car (and by car I mean Oldsmobile) coming toward my train car.
I SLAMMED on the train brakes and it skidded many feet, and the Olds
swerved off the tracks and back on, and I knew I was caught.</p>

<p class=dream>They told me to put my hands down and not touch
anything.  The guy approached me and yelled at me for having done
something so dangerous.  Told me they were supposed to be bound for
Missouri tonight and then Chicago. I told him I thought it was okay
because they hadn't moved all weekend.  He said that was because it
was the weekend.</p>

<p class=dream>As a makeup, I offered to move the car back by hand to
where it should be.  He agreed to that and we walked over to the train
car and I noted how steep the grade was that it needed to climb.  I
got some old fence posts to act as a lever to move the train car up
the hill.  It was actually quite easy except for one hump, but I got
it over the hump on the second try.  Then I was coasting downhill
toward the highway and the guy's partner was supposed to stop the
train car with the controls, but he waited until the last second
before I crossed the highway.  I was riding on the train car like a
shopping cart and didn't flinch; I knew he would stop it in time.  He
did.</p>

<p class=dream>He laughed it off; "I was trying to scare him, and I
did."  Ha.  I wasn't scared.</p>

<p>I remember two dreams from last night:</p>

<p class=note>(dream 1 (4am-ish)</p>

<p class=dream>In some sort of halfway house or something where the
kids were not being treated very well.  There was a guy who died and
was pulled out of his room on a stretcher and everyone was all sad,
but then the guy stood up, "I'm not dead, I was just comatose," as he
walked away.</p>

<p class=dream>We all cheered his instant recovery.  Then I went into
the halfway house which had broken windows and lots of nutty little
rooms and twisty passages.  Ryan McCarthy was there, and he wanted to
get out, but wasn't able to but I was on a flying device, and in a
mostly lucid dream; I could fly, but not perfectly well, and it was
difficult to fly with Ryan also hanging on my flying surfboard type
thing.</p>

<p>I've never had to use an object so that I could fly, but I
visualized one for this dream so that Ryan would have something to
hold on to.</p>

<p class=dream>We busted out of the wall from the second floor and
were immediately in the air and flying pretty well away from the
house, but then we were too low to get over the fence.  I tried to
swoop us both up, but Ryan's head got lodged between the fence and a
tree growing next too it.  He wasn't hurt, but just stuck.  I climbed
over the fence and Ryan got over as well, but then the bad lady came
and was trying to bring us back.  We ran and ran to get away.</p>

<p>I remember waking up from that dream with chills all over my
body.</p>

<p class=note>(dream 2:  7am-ish)</p>

<p class=dream>Driving on a highway and saw a sign that the road was
going to be split in the middle, but there was no indication of which
lane would end or how it was going to work.  I was watching for the
lane to end in the middle of the 4 lane, not knowing which of the
middle two lanes would end, and so I changed lanes to the outside lane
and suddenly I was stuck there by a small retaining wall, and there
were hundreds of people in the lane!  I was driving highway speeds and
about to hit them when I jumped over the retaining wall and didn't hit
anyone.</p>

<p class=dream>The highway was two stories above the
ground and a truck driver had a huge inflatable ball like 10 feet
across and he bounced it up from the ground onto the highway, and it
bounced like all well-inflated balls should and bounced off the
highway back onto the ground.  He didn't notice this, and I tried to
get his attention and explain that he should look for the ball behind
him.</p>

<p>He noticed it and tried again.  By this time I was on the ground
watching.  He bounced it up and a car or truck hit it and bounced it
off the freeway onto the ground where it rolled in a lot of traffic.
I cringed, thinking it would cause an accident, but my fears were
forgotten when a van hit/bounced it off the road and over near us.</p>

<p class=dream>The ball was still inflated but only 2 feet across
now.  According to the guy it was to be put on a billboard, but the
billboard company could just reinflate it; they would put a compressor
and valve on it anyway to keep it at the correct pressure.</p>
