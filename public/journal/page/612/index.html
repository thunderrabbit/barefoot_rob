<p><p>So tired.</p>

<p><p>So dirty.</p>

<p><p>Ultimate for 2 hours until the teams dwindled from 7 on 7 with subs to 5 on 5 savage.  One guy was so speedy out there (actually 3 guys) and I felt dissed when they zipped around me to catch the disk.  Mike smacked the disk down just before it got to me once and I was pissed but didn&rsquo;t quit and didn&rsquo;t yell.</p>

<p><p>I kept playing and got a great catch once and one of the speedy guys said, &ldquo;good move.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Thanks, I learned it from you.&rdquo;  I felt a bit better then.</p>

<p><p>And then the best of all my defensive plays, running to the endzone as Bill was about to catch the disk way up, I jumped and just smacked it with one finger way far out of play.  I did a small victory lap before picking it up.</p>

<p><p>Super duper thanks to Mollie for water after the game, and for being such good spirits during play when we were getting whupped.</p>

<p><p>This evening was quite lovely!  Wende called our neighbors
Bob-and-Jennifer and we all went out for mexican food at a samll
restaurant and just talk talk talk talked for about two hours.  Then
to Kroger where we got ice cream for dessert at me-an-Wende&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p><p>We talk talk talked more and then the fireworks began.  We all
scampered up to our bedroom and watched the fireworks over the city,
oooohing and aaaaahing at the various cool shapes.  My favorites are
the smiley faces!</p>

<p><p>After it was over, downstairs we munched ice cream and apple pie
that Bob brought over from their place.  (Wende and I share a house
wall with Bob and Jennifer&hellip; very convenient when hanging out)</p>

<p><p>More stories and fun and then they went home.  I&rsquo;m quite thankful
to have such cool neighbors!</p>

<p class=note>(dreams)</p></p>

<p><p>Wende and I were in the car listening to the radio at about 3am.
Listening to 104KRBE and Sam Malone was just arriving into the station.
We arrived at the station and I was going to go say HI to him and try
to get free tickets and stuff.</p>

<p><p>We pulled into the parking lot, facing some tennis courts, and the
station was behind us in the parking lot in a small one-or-two room
building.</p>

<p><p>I told Wende I would just be a second, when I went in, and that she
could just stay in teh car.  As I said this, I knew it wasn&rsquo;t going to
take only a second, though..</p>

<p><p>I went inside and the radio station was KTRU, not KRBE and Sarah P
(KTRU&rsquo;s current DJ Director) was the DJ at the moment.</p>

<p><p>She was playing some various tunes and then played the audio
portion of a billiards game that was being shown on a small TV in the
station.  The billiards playrs weren&rsquo;t doing all that well, and I asked
if I could make fun of them on the air.  She said no, that wouldn&rsquo;t be
in line with KTRU&rsquo;s mission.</p>

<p><p>She went over toward the kitchen (the station was looking more like
a house (large screen TV to the right of the DJ console, kitchen to
the right (TV to the left)) and all the records and CDs in the living
room.</p>

<p><p>She came back with her cat and asked if I would be scared of it,
because it was actually a snake.  I was like, snakes no problem, but
then I could see its head was triangular in shape (like a venomous
snake) and she said it was venomous, but didn&rsquo;t usually bite people.</p>

<p><p>I was suddenly quite scared to hold it, but by that time, it had
already snaked its way onto my arm and kinda hooked its body around my
back.  Sarah was trying to pull it off, but the snake was enjoying my
body heat and didn&rsquo;t want to go.</p>

<p><p>I was nervous/scared the entire time that it would strike me, but
she finally got it off and put it on the ground, where it reformed
into a cat around my feet.  I was standing at the DJ console trying to
play records and stuff, while shifting my feet around trying to keep
this cat-snake from rubbing its head agains my leg.</p>

<p><p>Finally Sarah came back and took the cat back to wherever it had
been.</em></p>

<p><p>- - - - other dream  - &ndash;</p>

<p><p><em>My dad and Wende were at the radio station with me, this stime
during my shift, and Wende cued up a song on CD, Madonna&rsquo;s &ldquo;Crazy For
You&rdquo;.  I told her that she had done a fine job of cueing it up.</p>

<p><p>While I was praising her cueing skills, the song ended, and I had
nothing else cued up ready to go.  Instead of going on mic and saying,
&ldquo;oops bad DJ didn&rsquo;t have a song ready to go&rdquo; or something (as I
normally would do) I just let the next song play as I went to look in
the stacks for a good CD.</p>

<p><p>I found A CD by Asphodel (that is a record label name actually) and
slammed the song on top of the current Madonna song that was playing.</em></p>

<p><p>Today Wende and I put up some Elfa in our garage.  (Elfa is the
shelving stuff sold by Container Store.)  We didn&rsquo;t hit any studs in
the wall, so we ran out of sheetrock anchors.  But we got most of the
shelving up that we wanted to do.  Soon she&rsquo;ll be able to park inside
the garage instead of on the driveway!</p>

<p><p><em>kT and I were in my new house hanging out and the house was my
parents old house but it was somehow given to me to live in .  The
house had been moved to some new land.</p>

<p><p>We were waiting for Anna to come by and we were going to say
goodbye to her before she goes off to the wild blue yonder in Canada.
kT caled Anna and was talking to her about possible coming over to say
HI.  Anna was an hour away and it was late, but she said she would
drive over and be there in an hour.</p>

<p><p>I was going to sleep for an hour and told kT to wake me up when Anna
got there.</p>

<p><p>I went into my parent&rsquo;s master bedroom and was amazed how how
truly big it was.  the closets were the size of rooms and all their
old stuf was in shelves.  I recognized I had been living there for a
while, but hadn&rsquo;t actually used a or seen all the rooms int he house.</p>

<p><p>Back behind the closet was the bathroom and behind that a hottub
and jaccuzzi type thing.  Behind that was a room dedicated just to
model trains.  There was an O-scale train set half built, but abandoned
during construction.  There was a completed train set outside the
window, but it had been neglected after it was built.</p>

<p><p>We were drawing pictures for Anna in a hurried fashion before she
arrived an hour later.  kT had already started on one on a white
napkin, but I wanted to find some paper.  I remembered where paper had
been, but it didn&rsquo;t seem to be there anymore&hellip;  Finally I found some
that would do - it was hidden in with my last year&rsquo;s Youth Council
stuff.</p>

<p><p>I gave some sheets to kT to draw on, and then I was going to nap.</p>

<p><p>I was at Elizabeth Gammell&rsquo;s house, just before she was going to go
on vacation, and I was just visiting and wanted to use a pillow in her
dining room to just to rest my head.  I curled up on the floor to
sleep, and woke up.</em></p>

<p><p>Work is sluggish today..  I&rsquo;m doing as much coding as normal, but there&rsquo;s not the normal flood of emails that we usually get on a daily basis.</p>

<p><p>My current project is going well, but it might be a bit too big for my own good or for its own britches or something.</p>

<p><p>Yesterday Wende and I joined my dad and my
dad&rsquo;s-girlfriend&rsquo;s-daughter Elise at the movies to see
<em>Chicken Run</em>!  Erika at my work said it was as
funny as <em>The Wrong Trousers</em>.  (I have to
disagree; <em>Wrong Trousers</em> had more laughs
<em>and</em> was a shorter movie, so the laugh/minute ratio
was much higher for <em>Trousers</em>.)</p>

<p><p>Anyway, <em>Chicken Run</em> was still pretty
funny, and got funnier as the movie progressed.</p>

<p><p>After the movie, we visited The (new) Container
Store and were joined by Karen, Elise&rsquo;s mom.  We got
my dad some cool gifts for Dad&rsquo;s Day and then went to
munch at Souper Salad.</p>

<p><p>Then Elise went to work at Whole Foods near
me-an-Wende&rsquo;s house.  Dad and Wende and I cruised
toward home, but stopped by his new &ldquo;office.&rdquo;  I was
so astonished&hellip;  my dad has an office just for his
hypnotherapy practice!  Wow!</p>

<p><p>How inspired I am at his positive role modeling -
if he can do it, I can do it&hellip;  I don&rsquo;t really have
words for it, but I&rsquo;m inspired by and proud of his
efforts and success.  So absolutely great!!</p>

<p><p>We hung out at his house for a bit and then had to
go home so I could do KTRU.</p>

<p><p>Yay DAD!!!!!!!!</p>

                        <p class=date>7:49am Sunday 2 July 2000</p>

<p><p>KTRU was pretty fun last night.  I got a couple of
calls from Erin, another DJ who requested some cool
songs.  I am amazed that she told me other DJs
wouldn&rsquo;t play her stuff!  I mean, if they have a
specialty show with a format, then yeah, but she asked
me if my show was a general shift before she made her
request.  Very odd.</p>

<p><p>KTRU is a station that broadcasts Emergency Alert
System messages.  These are the messages that
interrupt the broadcast signal</p>

<pre>
BEEEEEEEEEEP

"The National Weather Service has issued a severe
storm watch in effect for Montgomery and Liberty
County at 9:01pm until 9:45pm" etc etc
</pre>

<p><p>and we have no control of the message as it is
playing.  (The messages are received by the EAS
receiving device and if the message is directed at our
geographic broadcast area, we have 3 minutes to
broadcast the message manually.  If it is not
broadcast within that time period, it will broadcast
automatically.  (This allows the DJ to finish a song
or finish speaking or something.))</p>

<p><p>We got two EAS messages last night.  The first one
did not broadcast automatically.  I called Will, the
general station manager who explained that the message
will only broadcast automatically if it pertains to
our broadcast area.  While I was talking to him, we
received another EAS message, and the song I was
playing ended.  So I was all kinda rushed and verbally
relayed the message that we did not have to send,
saying we would keep people informed.  Then I read
through the list of songs I had just played and then
put on the next song.</p>

<p><p>During this song, the second EAS message
automatically broadcast itself (it had been 3 minutes
since I received it while on the phone with Will,
while I relayed the previous message and the other
song titles and then played part of this song)
<em>bang</em></p>

<pre>
The National Weather Service has issued a severe storm
warning for the following counties...  blah blah blah
</pre>

<p><p>This is being broadcast over the air, totally
obliterating the song (and I didn&rsquo;t think to
<em>pause</em> the CD) and THEN, a commercial was
tacked onto the end of the message!!</p>

<p><p><em><b><font size="+2"
color="#FF0000">GASP!!!</font>  A commercial??  On
KTRU?  Unthinkable!!!  Inconceivable!!</b></em>  Well,
it happened baby, and I was there.  Will called back
and goes &ldquo;[product name], eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I had no control!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I know, just log it in the Engineering Remarks
section of the log.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>So the other station (101.1 FM KLOL) errored and
added the commercial to the end of the EAS warning.
Very funny in a way.</p>

<p><p>I wonder if they will be fined?  How ironic that
would be!  If so, [product name] should pay the fine.</p>

<p><p>The remainder of the shift was pretty bland
compared to all that.</p>

<p><p>Wende and I watched <em>Patriot Games</em> tonight,
which was pretty good, but not astonishing.</p>

<p><p>Afterward, I drove to KTRU to say HI to Tejus (who
hosts the Friday night MK Ultra show), and Vishnu, who
spins records on the last Friday of each month.</p>

<p><p>I got there and the door was locked to the
building.  Not surprising because it&rsquo;s summer session
and not many peoples are on campus.</p>

<p><p>Called from the outside phone and no one answered.</p>

<p><p>Called the secret DJ number from the outside phone
and no one answered.</p>

<p><p>Back around to where the station windows overlook
the street and hoped someone would just happen to look
out and see me.</p>

<p><p>Threw a couple of little rocks, but didn&rsquo;t hit the
window cause I was throwing them softly because I
didn&rsquo;t want to break it&hellip;</p>

<p><p>I wondered in what type of trouble I could find
myself for throwing rocks at the window&hellip; Would the
campus police handcuff me?  Fine me?  Lock me up for
the weekend?</p>

<p><p>Then I found the seed pods of a ______ (*) tree
that were perfect!  I threw them in succession fairly
accurately against the window.</p>

<p><p>tink!</p>

<p><p>tink!</p>

<p><p>tock (concrete)</p>

<p><p>tink!</p>

<p><p>tink!</p>

<p><p>After a couple of volleys, someone looked out, and
someone else let me in.</p>

<p><p>HI to Tejus and HI to Vishnu and then they left.</p>

<p><p>That&rsquo;s the anticlimactic part.  Bluh.</p>

<p><p>I drove home wondering why I went out there, trying
to make myself feel better that I got to see them,
that I told them I would probably go out there so I
did the right thing, blah blah blah&hellip; but the truth
is, I just wanted them to like me.  I just want to
feel cool like I imagine a turntable DJ must feel.</p>

<p><p>What a load of crap.  Turntablism is a learned
skill that takes tons of practice and talent and
practice practice practice.  How can I expect to be
cool just by saying HI to such a DJ for 30 seconds
every six months??</p>

<p><p>I waver back and forth between:</p>

<p><p>1) Learning new skills all the time just because I
can</p>

<p><p>2) Forget turntablism; it&rsquo;s more work than you are
willing to do</p>

<p><p>AND I&rsquo;m rambling.  It&rsquo;s 2:07am.  I spent most of
the time on this entry looking for the type of tree up
by the (*).  They&rsquo;re all around my dad&rsquo;s house.  I
should know it..  I&rsquo;m thinking Chinese Pear Tree or
something.  bluh.  good night.</p>

<p><p>Yes, it was 3am.  Wende had to hang out at work
crazy late while the carpets were cleaned.</p>

<p><p>I came out to escort her to the parking lot after
they left.</p>

<p><p>They were supposed to be done by 1am, but that
didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>

<p><p>I helped Wende organize stuff at some of the cash
registers.</p>

<p><p>After all that I got to use their coin counter to
count all the coins in my glass 5 gallon jar (which
has about 1 inch of coins at the bottom)!</p>

<pre>
dollars        $27.00
half dollars    $0.00  (they won't fit in the jar)
quarters      $202.25
dimes          $52.40
nickels        $20.60
pennies         $0.01
              -------
              $302.26
</pre>

<p><p>Wow!</p>
