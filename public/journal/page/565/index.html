<p>Such a great time with family talking during and
after dinner.  Mostly talked about Aussie Rules
Football to kick off the conversation and then just
all the little cultural differences, mostly about
speech: pronounciation and idioms.</p>

<p>I was tired, but quite thoroughly engaged by the
conversation and could have stayed up much later.</p>

<p>Now Wende and I are sleepin' on a full sized
waterbed back at Nick and Irene's house.  This will be
our room during this trip.</p>

<p>We were supposed to start boarding 30 minutes ago,
but have not yet.  Well, actually they just now
started, 30 minutes late.  I imagine we will still
barely get out kinda on time.   Supposed to leave at
11:15pm local time.  (It's 10:47 local time now)</p>

<p class=date>1:00 am (11pm LA) (6pm Mel) (5 more
hours be awake)</p>

<p>We are on the plane.  And let me tell you, that I
cannot possibly tell you how -*!<em>CUTE</em>!*- was
the Aussie accent of one of the flight attendants. 
And I say "one" of the attendants because I haven't
heard any of the others speak.  Her accent was SO
Awesome!!!!</p>

<p>So, for the record, we are on a Boeing 747-400, in
seat 68A and 68C, and hoping we will not have a
passenger in 68B.  ;-)</p>

<p>There are 3 seats on the left side, then 4 seats in
the middle, and 3 seats on the right side.  I must say
it's not as big as when Fred and I went to Australia
with our parents in 1986.  I remember it to be 4
seats, then 5 seats, then 4 seats again.  And we sat
in the middle section; I know that for sure.</p>

<p>There are a lot of young passengers on the
airplane.  Maybe 15 percent seem to be high school
youth age and just traveling without parental units. 
Maybe 15% is not a big deal.  Whatever.</p>

<p class=date>1:12 am</p>

<p>They are on the intercom, "Passenger Say, Es Ay
Why, please make yourself known to the flight crew."

<p class=date>1:14 am</p>

<p>They are still looking for passenger Say.  We were
scheduled to be taking off right about now.</p>

<p>On the 747 watching huge blast from the engien.  From this seat I
can see the back of the outer left engine and the water on the ground
being blown hard backward.</p>

<p>We are taxiing around the airport.  I have Wende's watch so I can
fill in the time needed to accelerate to takeoff.  I wonder what
airspeed that is.</p>

<p>They have given us headphones and socks and eyemask and pillow and
blanket.</p>

<p>Chillin beside sign [[Q1] <- Q -> ] at 1:43am CST.  We're 30
minutes late taking off.</p>

<p class=date>11:46 pm PST</p>

<p>Moving now from Q1 sign.</p>

<p class=date>11:48 pm PST</p>

<p>We are stopped again.</p>

<p class=date>11:51 pm</p>

<p>Still stopped.</p>

<p>Wow suddenly I'm crazy tired.</p>

<p class=date>11:52 pm</p>

<p>Engines winding up we are moving.  Taxiing [T 25R-7L]</p>

<p>We are en queue for takeoff but still need to turn around.</p>

<p class=date>11:54 pm</p>

<p>huge aleron on wing.  Extended way back.  Barely taxiing about to
turn around I think.  Since we got on 25 R-7L runway 2 planes have
taken off before us.  One just now (737) and one 747 and another 737.
Three total.</p>

<p class=date>11:58 pm</p>

<p>I just heard a tone and the captain said gently, "sit down!"  A 747
is rolling beside us and bang they go.  We are rumbling behind and
beside them and now turning around on U7L.  I can see 4 planes in
queue behind us.</p>

<p>We are 90 degrees, 135, 170, 180 degrees turned.</p>

<p>12:00am local time 7pm in Melbourne.</p>

<p>We are just about to <b>GO!</b></p>

<p>I have Wende's second hand on her watch.</p>

<p>I have totally thrilled at the dynamic readout on
the movie screen telling our speed!</p>

<p>It displays various measurements for barely long
enough for me to type them.</p>

<pre>
groundspeed 901 km/h 
alt 310000 ft = 9448 m
temp -50 degrees Fahrenhieght = -46 degrees celcius
23 minutes flight time 
357 miles out.
</pre>

<p>To the best of my ability I wrote a lot of such
measurements in my diary, which will be transcribed to
the previous entry.</p>

<pre>
groundspeed 905 km/h  
altitude 948 m  
-49 F = -45 C
</pre>

<p class=date>2:36 am</p>

<p>now they are showing a video thing, but I can't
hear the audio in my headphones - just rockin'
elevator music.</p>

<p>I'm now going to switch my Visor to Melbourne time
as the default.</p>

<p class=date>7:41 pm Tuesday 13 February 2001
(melbourne time)</p>

<p>Now I have audio in my headphones that would match
the video if one were playing.</p>

<p class=date>8:37 pm Tuesday 13 February 2001</p>

<p>It appears the two movies that we will be able to
view are not two movies that really interest me. </p>

<p>I've been watching their MTV-News-ish programming
with sports, fashion, Australia each represented.  I'm
getting pretty tired.</p>

<p>Only 2.25 more hours to go until sleep time!</p>

<p class=date>9:11 pm MEL</p>

<p>Oh my god this was so funny!!!</p>

<p>I went to the bathroom (not funny), peed (not
funny), and noticed the hole in the bottom of the
toilet was relatively small (hmm, that's funny..)</p>

<p>I flushed it (not funny), and then
WHOOOOOOOSHHH!!!!! it sucked air down the hole <em>so
fast!!</em></p>

<p>Oh my gosh!</p>

<p>I flushed it again.</p>

<p>WHOOOOOOSSHHHH!!!!</p>

<p>Wow!!!</p>

<p>I yanked a length of about 8 squares of toilet
paper off the roll, dangled them above the hole.</p>

<p>WHHOOOOOOOOSHSH FFFFFPP!</p>

<p>It sucked the paper down <em>shoop!</em></p>

<p>I unhooked the roll from the wall, and dangled the
end of it over the toilet, hoping to get a Calvin and
Hobbes toilet paper unrolling.</p>

<p>WHOOOOOOSSHHHH!!   fwip!</p>

<p>It yanked the paper off the roll, and the roll did
not spin at all.  Oh well.</p>

<p>On more 8 or 10 square length dangled over the
toilet</p>

<p>WHOOOOOOOSSHHHH!!!!  fwwwwpp!!</p>

<p>Hahahha!!  So Hilarious!!!</p>

<p>Just as I left, one of the stewards was walking
with purpose toward the restroom.  Do they have a
Frequent Flushing Indicator?</p>

<p class=date>9:20 pm (4:20am CST)</p>

<p>That was enough entertainment for 1 night for me. 
Especially since the movie is <em>Meet The
Parents</em>, which I did not really like in the
theaters.  I'm going to go to sleep.</p>

<p class=date>1:24am CST Monday 12 February 2001</p></p>

<p>Wende is being quite careful and meticulous as she packs our
toiletries for Australia.  I would just toss soap and shampoo and
towel into a bag.  She's using her new label maker to label items with
typeface perfect lettering.  Very cute.</p>

<p>I think it's 6:24pm in Melbourne now.  Still quite a few hours to
stay awake if I intend to get on their schedule.  I won't stay up for
too much longer tonight; I imagine I'll be able to sleep plenty long
enough on the 14 hour flight.</p>

<p>Hmmm.  It has suddenly come to our attention that we are not sure
where our plane tickets are.  Wende had them last when she got her
passport, so I'm not too worried about us (her) not finding them.
Wende is normally a genius at finding things, even if I'm the last one
who had them.</p>

<p class=date>2:10am</p>

<p>Don't worry.  I found them on the stairs.</p>

<p>I confirmed our departure airport by calling the 1-800 number and
talking to a computer voice woman.  Relatively good speech recognition
software on their end, and exceptionally good pattern matching on
finding correct flights.  And it was quite user friendly.</p>

<p>I'm pretty much going to bed now.  It's currently 7:40 pm tomorrow
in Melbourne.</p>

<p>I've been in work meetings all this morning, and I'm about to leave.
But(!) I just remembered that I need to sync my Handspring Visor and move
some entries online that I wrote last night!</p>

<p class=date>12:42pm</p>

<p>Okay, I just put them all online, and I'm going to geo Go!</p>

<p>Bye, work!  Have fun without me!</p>

<p>This counts as my first entry that will be stored
in my Visor until we get back!  We have just dropped
off my car at the car place to be fixed while we're
gone.  New brakes, power steering and new reverse
lights.</p>

<p>We are essentially all packed, super duper thanks
to Wende and her Container Store prowess.</p>

<p class=date>5:10 pm</p>

<p>We are now at the airport gate.  Super duper thanks
to Jennifer for dropping us off!  I'm excited and not
nervous; Wende is nervous a little bit, and I'm not
sure exactly why...  it is a big trip, and everything
is going perfectly.</p>

<p>Our flight is scheduled to leave at 5:55pm</p>

<p class=date>5:38 pm</p>

<p>On the plane now.  I just mailed some bills that we
had outstanding. Water, cellphone, auto insurance,
something else.  Gave all my metal items to Wende so I
could easily come back through the security gate after
mailing them.</p>

<p class=date>5:41 pm</p>

<p>Wende just went over our checklist.  "let me see if
we brought everything, now that we're on the
plane."</p>

<p class=date>6:23 pm (11:23am Tuesday in
Melbourne)</p>

<p>I just wrote a note on the barf bag, after I got
the great idea from someone on my most recent
flight:</p>

<pre>
HI        12 February 2001
I'm Rob.  Nice to meet
you!  I hope you have
a super good flight with
plenty of tasty beverages and
smiling faces.

We are en route to
Los Angeles from Houston
and then to Melbourne Australia!

Read all about it (when
we get back 21 Feb) on 
my website  www.robnugen.com

bye!   - ROB
</pre>

<p>Wende points out the good point that a badguy could
find the bag today and find out our address from my
name and break in, knowing that we aren't going to be
home..  Hmmm.  Maybe I'll just put the bag on the
plane while we are actually en route back to
Houston.</p>

<p class=date>6:29 pm</p>

<p>Wende just looked around a little bit and stated
plainly with a smile: "I'm bored."</p>

<p>Oh well.</p>

<p>The plane we are on is a "Super 80."  I think it's
a DC 80.  It's got 2 seats on the left side, the aisle
and then 3 seats on the right side.  In first class, 2
seats on each side.</p>

<p>I've decided I'm going to stay awake for 12 more
hours, which will be 11:30pm Tuesday in Australia. 
Then I can sleep for 8 or so hours and wake up and
watch the landing and stuff at 9:15am.  (I know the
math doesn't work exactly, but whatever.)</p>

<p class=date>6:36 pm</p>

<p>This flight is quite empty.  Only about 25% full of
people, and only like 15 percent in first class.</p>

<p class=date>6:38 pm</p>

<p>Dinner time.  Chicken or pasta.  I'm getting
chicken.</p>

<p class=date>7:00 pm (noon Tuesday in Melbourne)</p>

<p>Just ate dinner.  11 more hours to stay awake. 
Yummy chocolate brownie and crispy cold lettuce (but
lots of white and not much green) and chicken with
barbecue sauce and sliced potatoes and green
beans.</p>

<p>Oh, I saw a plane down below us, flying just a tad
faster than us, and it seemed to fly under our path. 
Interesting.  How do "they" keep track of what planes
may fly at what levels and which direction?</p>

<p>Wende gave me some of her brownie and said "chew
slowly, that's all you get."  so I packed it into the
roof of my mouth.  She gave me another piece and I
smushed it up with the rest.  I even got a third
little bite of brownie, and squished it up there as
well.  Now her brownie is all gone, but I still have
some.</p>

<p class=date>7:26 pm</p>

<p>We are above El Paso now.</p>

<p>Just about to exit the Texas airspace.</p>

<p>I'm writing a letter to my brother Fred.</p>

<p class=date>7:36 pm  (5:36pm Los Angeles, noon:36pm
Tuesday in Melbourne)</p>

<p>The sunset, Wende points out is perfectly Roy G Biv
in its smooth striations. Wow!  It sure is.  That is
really amazing.  How does it do that?</p>

<p>When we flew over El Paso, there was a cool lighted
web of lights, like a glowing spiderweb fallen on the
ground.</p>

<p class=date>8:37 pm CST (6:37pm LA) (1:37pm tomorrow
Melbourne)</p>

<p>We are in descent now.  I think it's cool that I
can feel the instant of change from stable cruising
altitude to that <em>tiny</em> shift downward.</p>

<p>I have written a letter to my brother, which I will
send from LA, and a letter to my mom, which I will
send from Melbourne. (*)</p>

<p>Wende and I intend to explore around the airport a
bit before we check in.  We have a 3 hour layover.</p>

<p>10.25 hours more to stay awake.</p>

<p>(*) I forgot to mail it.</p>

<p>Wende writes:</p>

<p class=message>okay.  so i'm very super-tired and a
little grumpy.   i'm also more nervous about this trip
than i would've expected.  so here we sit at the
'daily express' and we just paid $20 for a $7 meal.  a
friendly airport employee (actually she is probably an
American Airlines employee) suggested that we take a
bus to terminal 6 and go to 'the encounter' - a
restaurant that is very expensive but very cool, she
says.  it may turn out that i'm too much of a chicken
to go anywhere...  but my heart's in it.  my pizza is
ready now.</p>

<p class=date>10:50 pm CST (8:50pm LA) (1:50pm
tomorrow in Melbourne)</p>

<p>We're munching just barely in time for lunch in
Melbourne!</p>

<p>The guy behind the counter was pretty much a rude
mf; I wonder if that is him, or LA in general.</p>

<p>Getting off the plane, we had no idea which way to
go in the terminal.  It reminded me of the end of
_Cast Away_, when Tom Hanks was at an intersection of
2 seemingly indentical roads that went off into
infinity in opposing directions.</p>

<p>We had signs though, and followed them outside and
into the International Terminal.  Bunches of differnt
countries' airways represented, and we finally found
Quantas.</p>

<p>The girls behind the counter were super nice and
even gave Wende an envelope so we can mail Fred his
letter from here.</p>

<p>Our check-in time begins at 10:15, one hour before
our flight leaves.  It's 8:57 pm local time now.</p>

<p>Oh, I'm bummed that I didn't think to tell Bethany
(who is in LA now, working to be on TV) that we would
be here!  Even more sad because Hillary is visiting
her now.  Doh!</p>

<p class=date>11:36 pm 12-2-01</p>

<p>We just went outside to ride the A Bus, which makes
a trek around the entire airport in about 20 minutes. 
This instead of riding a tram, which they apparently
do not have here.</p>

<p>Outside, we discovered a cacauphony of honks and
cars and cold rain and wind and cigarette smoke and
just all kinds of blucky stuff.  We saw a Bus C, but
not a Bus A after several minutes standing
outside.</p>

<p>"Let's just go back inside where it's warm."</p>

<p>"Okay."</p>

<p>We have just put addresses and stamps to mail
Fred's letter to him, and copies of our passports back
to Jennifer.  (Inside the passport itself we read that
it's good to have a copy of it at home with a
friend.)</p>

<p class=date>5:15pm MEL Tuesday 13 February 2001</p>

<p>We are chillin' at the gate with Irene's parents
and her brother Tom.  I've met them all before a
various times.  Parents when I first met Wende, and
Tom relatively recently when he was in Houston with
Irene and Nick.</p>

<p>We are filling out our customs survey things.  "Are
you bringing into Australia animals, parts of animals
and products in contact with animals including
equipment, eggs, biological specimens, birds, fish,
insects, coral, shells, bees, bee products, pet
food?"</p>

<p>That kind of thing.</p>

<br>Well, I&rsquo;m back, was completely busy with stuff, fall mountain bike racing season just ended, lots of new stuff at work to deal with.  Now things are calming down at work.  Cyclocross racing season is in full swing, and am having a great time at that&hellip; but, pulled hamstring at Wednesday practice at memorial park&hellip; can I race tomorrow?  Good question.<br>
<br>
I&rsquo;ll be back to catching up in your journal.  Hope you are doing well.<br>

<p>Wende feels a bit nervous about leaving tomorrow. 
I still feel fine.  We're about to determine our
schedule for tomorrow so i can get my car to the shop
and go to work.</p>

<p>We'll leave the house at 4pm.</p>

<p>We still need to pack.</p>

<p>Okay.  I'm going to go to work from about 10am to
noon for our weekly meeting.  Then Wende will help me
get Scott to the doctor and then we will finish
packing and go to the airport!</p>
