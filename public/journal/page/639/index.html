<p><p>Optimism is good, though I&rsquo;m not optimistic about getting a free fix.
 I&rsquo;m soon going to go get Scott and take him to a different shop to see
what they say.</p>

<p><p><hr></p>

<p><p>Here at work, we just bought a .nu domain!  <a 
href="https://www.fsd.nu">www.fsd.nu</a> now points to our machines.
 Amazing!  I looked for <a href="https://www.rob.nu">rob.nu</a>, but it&rsquo;s
been taken.  Today I&rsquo;ve mostly been messing with configuring machines and
increasing our DSL speed, debating spellings for on-line, off-line, web
site, e-mail (vs online, offline, website, email), and sending back the
router from our old ISP.</p>

<p><p>I love this job: such great variety!</p>

<p><p>With Love
<br>- Rob</p>

<p><p>PS: a note on dates: above, you may notice that I used 1900.  Here is my
technique: If I remember in time, I put 2000.  If I totally forget, I put
1999 (I think I&rsquo;ve done this once on my site).  If I remember midway, I&rsquo;ll
put 1900.</p>

<p><p>Makes sense to me!  :-)</p>

<p class=date>8:12pm CST Tuesday 4 January 2000</p></p>

<p><p>This is pretty cool.  At least it&rsquo;s cool to me, an emacs computer nerd.</p>

<p><p>First, a tiny bit of background:  I&rsquo;m using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to format these pages.  The date above (which should be blue and bigger than this text (unless I change how the date is formatted)) is formatted using the following tags:</p>

<p><p><pre>
&lt;p class=date&gt;date goes here&lt;/p&gt;
</pre></p>

<p><p>CSS enabled browsers find a class called date in the header and determines it should be blue and bigger.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m using emacs to write journal entries.  Emacs rules.</p>

<p><p>- - - - - - end of background info - - - - - -</p>

<p><p>With Fred&rsquo;s help, I wrote a macro in emacs that will write the CSS-html code and put the date in there automagically!  So I can just load a file, call the macro and <em>bing</em> the date line is done for me!!</p>

<p><p>Note: this only works at home, where I have emacs.  At work I have to use the dumb Wordpad editor which can&rsquo;t do much more than cut-n-paste.  So here at home I will probably always have the correct date!  (including 2000 instead of 1999 or 1900 :-)</p>

<p class=date>10:15pm Monday 3 January 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Today at work I got the second machine working. (That&rsquo;s two out of
three!) I had wiped out Win NT Server and installed Win NT Workstation,
but couldn&rsquo;t quite get it connected to the Internet.  Turns out I had
the cable plugged into the wrong NIC.  :-)</p>

<p><p>Felt grrrr at Toyota dealership, where they still haven&rsquo;t called me
back with a status on my car.  I was on hold for a while today (15
minutes) and finally got the status of, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll check it out and give you
an estimate and I will be in touch with you.&rdquo;  Hasn&rsquo;t called me back
yet.</p>

<p><p>Super thanks to Karla my boss who drove me to Electrotex to get a CAT
5 patch cable for our big monster server once I get it working.</p>

<p><p>I did not get it working though &ndash; didn&rsquo;t even get to the point where
I would need a cable!  For some dumb reason Win NT wouldn&rsquo;t let me
specify a third party driver for our RAID adapter.  &lsquo;twas very odd, but
not so odd that I was intrigued, more like disgusted again with
Microsoft&rsquo;s dumbness.</p>

<p><p>We need to install three new data ports at work, and happily enough,
I know how to do it!  (Ports on the wall where the computer network
cable connects) We got a patch cable which for now is simply strung
along the floor from our hub to the machine, but I&rsquo;ll get a 1000 foot
spool of cable, the connectors and all that happy stuff and set us up
with some new data ports!   (As soon as we decide where to put them.)</p>

<p><p><hr align=left width="20%"></p>

<p><p>In I-group, we began our discussion with &ldquo;Resolutions&rdquo; (as in New
Year&rsquo;s Resolutions), verbally swerved around a bit, and ended somewhere
around Live Now in This Moment.  I picked up a few good nuggets along
the way:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Write down a list of things I "tolerate" in my life. Do not
consciously think of how to fix them, just write them down.  Many will
fix themselves.

<p><li>Write down a list of achievements I've made in the past year.

<p><li>Doh!! I forgot to give my dad his Christmas present!

<p><li>Holy crap I forgot to pay my rent!

<p><li>I have not asked my landlord to replace my water heater, even though it is over 10 years old and sucks (sucks=doesn't produce particularly hot water), for fear that he might raise my rent.  It's ridiculous for me to live in this fear, and it's time to face it and tell him I want a new water heater.
</ul>

<p><p>We celebrated with some ice cream and cookies and cake at the end of
the evening, I drove home via my landlord&rsquo;s house, paid rent, and now
Wende and I are about to munch dinner.  (I will write a letter about the water heater instead of telling him at 9:30pm, &ldquo;here is my rent; it&rsquo;s 3 days late, and can you fix my water heater?&rdquo;)</p>

<p class=date>am 2 January 1999</p></p>

<p>Yesterday Fred and I got pizza at Star Pizza (best in
Houston) and took one to Wende at work.</p>

<p>While we waited for her to get her lunch break, we
practiced on Fred&rsquo;s unicycle!!!  That was fun,
munching pizza, making brief wobbly trips up to 30
feet from the truck.</p>

<p>One kid asked Fred, &ldquo;are you a clown?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but I&rsquo;m in training.&rdquo;</p>

<hr />

<p>Last night we went to Molly and Will&rsquo;s house for our
Christmas celebration and Molly has a unicycle!  I
totally forgot!!!  She got it during our college days
and it&rsquo;s sitting with flat tire in her garage.  I
think I might buy it from her!</p>

                        <p><title>Grrrr</title>
I am pissed at my brother for so blatantly not
planning ahead!  He&rsquo;s all, &ldquo;I planned to call Karen to
see if she can give me a ride to Katy&rsquo;s to get my
sweatshirt and then back to Dad&rsquo;s house to drop me
off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s been here for 2.5 fuckin&rsquo; days; seems like this
plan could have been figured out a tad before 3 hours
before he needs the ride.</p>

<p>What bugs me most (of course), is that I do it too,
but not to this degree!  (really!)</p>

<hr />

<p>Yesterday Fred and I were at my work, workin&rsquo; on the
PCs.  He was trying to get the Soundblaster card to
work in the first machine I set up, and I installed
Win NT 4.0 Server in a second machine.</p>

<p>We found a bug in the install process (big surprise):
when we install booting from CD-ROM, it will ask at
one point, &ldquo;please insert Setup Disk 3 into the CD-ROM
drive&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is no Disk 3 that will fit in the CD-ROM drive
and clicking OK with the one CD in there didn&rsquo;t work.</p>

<p>Installing using the floppies to boot, it works:
&ldquo;please insert Setup Disk 3 into the floppy drive&rdquo;<br />
It took me several tries booting from CD-ROM before I
tried booting from floppy.  Grrrrrr at Microsoft for
producing shitty software.</p>

<hr />

<p>But I got NT installed, installed MS Office on it, and
then I couldn&rsquo;t get the email stuff to work.  The
dialogue boxes are different than they are on NT 4.0
Workstation.  I am just not sure what to do.  I
haven&rsquo;t consulted support.microsoft.com, which I may
do.  I might also ask John (of John and Maggie) to
come look.</p>

<hr />

<p>Fred, Wende and I are &lsquo;bout to go meet my mom for
lunch!</p>

   - Rob</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ve been at work for the past 2 hours, trying to get the email thing to
work.  I&rsquo;ve tried a ridiculous number of variations, can&rsquo;t figure anything
out, so I decided to start over.</p>

<p><p>The hard drive is currently being low-level formatted; I&rsquo;ll install NT

<p class=date>1:43am Saturday 1 January 1900</p></p>

<p>We went; we saw; we yawned.</p>

<p>Wende and I do agree one thing was cool: the last minute of the
fireworks display was pretty impressive.</p>

<p>(The Power Of Houston celebration was WAY better!  30 minutes of
fireworks instead of 10, and it featured a <em>close</em> F-18 flyby.)</p>

<p>Lots of cars slowly driving; honking; people yelling.  Maybe it&rsquo;s like
Terminator II:  too much hype for not that great of a movie.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still excited to be able to say, &ldquo;well that&rsquo;s how we did it in the
1900s, but that&rsquo;s not how we do it now!&rdquo;  Or &ldquo;I remember back in the
1900s&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;m excited to write this first journal entry with the new 4 digits!</p>

<p class=date>2:02am Saturday 1 January 2000</p></p>

<p><p>I take it back; there was actually one pretty cool thing for me:
retrieving balloons out of the Hyatt Regency.</p>

<p><p>According to last year&rsquo;s paper, the Hyatt released 50,000 balloons
from its interior 30 story balcony at midnight.</p>

<p><p>About 30 minutes later, we were skating near there, and I just had to
get a balloon for each of us!</p>

<p><p>I careened off the street into the horde of tuxedoed men and sparkly
women waiting for cars or taxis or limos at the back exit.  I smiled to
the patrons, avoided eye contact with hotel employees, skated right in.</p>

<p><p>A cop was just inside the entrance, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t skate in here!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I just have to get three balloons!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Fine, but you can&rsquo;t skate in here!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>So I plopped down on the carpet, removed my skates, carried them in.
I had expected to see thousands of balloons, but instead I found
thousands of balloon carcasses carpeting the carpet with a rubbery layer
of rubber.  yeah.</p>

<p><p>A man smiled at me, &ldquo;nice tux!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Another guy was all, &ldquo;how&rsquo;d you get in here?&rdquo;  (&ldquo;I skated!&rdquo;)</p>

<p><p>Found some balloons that had fallen on the safe side of a table and
grabbed three.  It was quite cumbersome to carry my skates and three
inflated balloons, but I managed to get back to the door, where I
plopped down to reinstall my skates.</p>

<p><p>During the process, I lost one of the balloons in a draft from the
outside.. Doh! Oh well; I still had two.</p>

<p><p>Skates on, and ziinnnngg!!!  I busted out into the streets and back
toward Wende and Fred.  Oh wait, this is the wrong direction.</p>

<p><p>I had gotten turned around a bit by having exited the other end of
the car passenger zone thingie.  Got my bearings back after a block, and
scampered with one balloon streaming back from each hand back toward
Wende and Fred.</p>

<p><p>Raced to beat a red light and almost bonked a car, but I swerved
asymptotically to his velocity.</p>

<p><p>Gave Wende and Fred one balloon each and we went home.</p>

<p><p>With Love

                        <p class=date>Friday 5:04pm CST 31 December 1999</p>

<p><p>This is the last day of the nineteens!!!!!!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There's the whole debate about, "well, it's not really the millenium
or even the century cause way back in the day they started counting with
1 not 0 blahdiddyblah."

<p>Yes, I say, but realistically, what is *cool* is seeing those 000
zeros roll up onto the calendar.  I mean, driving in the car people
don't say oh look!  We just turned over 2001 miles!

<p>2000.  That's what's cool.

<p>(plus, kings and such changed the calendars arbitrarily to fit their
schedules or the schedule of the seasons or for whatever reasons they
had at various times back then.)
</blockquote>

<p><p>So anyway, this is the last of the 19s.  I mean I look back at my
ancestors and they may have been born in 1910 or 1903, but just&hellip; just
being born a few years prior and  <em>bing</em> it&rsquo;s 1800s and I think,
&ldquo;man! that&rsquo;s <b>old!</b>&ldquo;</p>

<p><p>So now <em>I</em> was born in the old century, I mean in the 19s.  Well, in
a few hours but yeah!</p>

<p><p><hr></p>

<p><p>At work today I installed Win NT 4.0 into one of the three machines.
Had a little bit of frustration, but I think I got it all down now.</p>

<p><p>First problem was I couldn&rsquo;t get it to recognize the new DMA66 IDE
drive it has.  Turns out Win NT doesn&rsquo;t know about this new thing, so I
had to install the driver from a separate disk.  That only took a few
tries to figure out.</p>

<p><p>Then when I got it installed I recognized I had created &ldquo;too many&rdquo;
partitions on the hard drive.  I had created 3 partitions, which threw
off the default drive letterings for the network drives.  Tried to
reinstall the OS to fix it, but realized I just had to use Disk
Administrator.  Cool.</p>

<p><p>One down, three to go!</p>

<p><p>Fred and I are now at Wende&rsquo;s, about to go play on his unicycle and
stuff.  Y2K downtown on skates tonight!!!!</p>

                        <p>Today I read Microsoft&rsquo;s installation manual for Win NT 4.0 Server.  Not
particularly informative, but it gave some good information.  Then I got
the wonderful phone call from Wade at the computer place.  &ldquo;Your
computers are ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wow!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thankful that he asked, &ldquo;would you like us to put the wheels on your
server?&rdquo; because otherwise I woulda just driven out there in Scott, my
little Camry and said, &ldquo;load &lsquo;em up!&rdquo; to a chorus of laughter, &ldquo;in that
little thing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instead I asked, &ldquo;just how big is this server?&rdquo;
I now suddenly had a vision of it being 5 feet tall with upper and lower
cooling fans, a walk-in see through front panel, and big wheels on the
bottom.
He said it wasn&rsquo;t <em>that</em> big, but I probably would want a truck
if I could get one.</p>

<p>So I got Wende&rsquo;s truck.  Said HI to her at Container Store and switched
keys.  Drove to the computer place, got 3 computers, drove to work,
couldn&rsquo;t get in.  The place was locked up and Wende had my keys.</p>

<p>Doh!</p>

<p>Back to Wende&rsquo;s work, grabbed my work keys, leaving her my car keys, and
went back to work.  Unloaded all 3 machines and monitors in two trips
using our dolly and began to set one up.  I started with the smallest
one first.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll keep this part short:  The end result is I couldn&rsquo;t get the UDMA66
IDE controller/cable/drive to work.  So I had to use the 33 IDE.  I
spent over an hour until I made this decision, and by that time, Wende
was off work and it was time to eat!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll work more on the computer(s) tomorrow.</p>

<hr />

<p>After mexican food (I had chicken burrito with avacado; Wende designed
her own combination meal) at La Jaliscience, the high-end mexican dive
within 2 blocks of my house, we drove to Sterling McCall Toyota to drop
off Scott for his 120,000 mile checkup.  He&rsquo;s 2.5 thousand miles early.</p>

<p>Now to bed early so I can go to work and then tomorrow TOMORROW begins
the new two digits!!!!!!</p>

<p>With Love
