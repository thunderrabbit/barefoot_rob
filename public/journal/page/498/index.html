<p>Bryn and I have just returned from The Fence, at which we attempted to place Magic Rob box, but were immediately approached by a woman who seemed rather cross, 'what are you doing?' 'I'm putting this box on the fence?' 'No we don't want anything on the fence; you must take it off,' as she was grabbing at the box.  Hmmmmm.</p>

<p>So we stepped away from the fence a bit, still with the box, and figured out what to do.  I wanted to at least for goodness sake's have a picture of the fence with my box.  I'm not coming all this way and not even get a picture of myself.</p>

<p>So without touching the fence, I stepped in front of it and asked Bryn to take a picture.  The woman and man stepped back out of their office.  I told them I'm not going to touch the fence; I'm just taking a picture of it.</p>

<p>She asked if I had anything better to do and why was I harassing the fence and I should go take a picture of some other fence.</p>

<p>'I've come to London just to see this fence, and would like to take a picture of it at least.'</p>

<p>Bryn took the picture, one serious, one happy, and then she gave me back the camera.  I was all, 'go back toward the pub; I'm going to take a picture of their office.'  The woman had the door open, glaring at me; I should have done a hip shot photo for when I put the camera up to my face, she shut the door abruptly and ignored me, talking to the man at his desk.</p>

<p>Back to the pub; this time I was careful to use the door not facing their office, for certainly glaring eyes were watching.  Around the corner and wondered again what to do.  I put the box beside the wall and stepped inside.  The fencemaster had another pint of Guiness on his table; I walked around to make sure it was him.</p>

<p>'How was it?' he inquired expectantly.</p>

<p>'We got kicked of pretty quickly.'</p>

<p>'Really?  Wow.'</p>

<p>'Yeah, she was pretty mad.  They said they would call the police and everything.'</p>

<p>'Oh this is <em>great</em>,' he emphasized.</p>

<p>He asked for the magic box and said, 'it's as good as on the fence, and I have a sneaking suspicion that this will be the next update on the website, and probably the last for a while.'</p>

<p>Awesome.</p>

<p>Bryn and I just finished our fish and chips; we're going now.</p>

Subject: closing the house
To: wende

HI Wen

Thank you so so so so much for your work and for
closing on the house without me there.  I shall write
you a postcard today.

I *might* even call you, but that's not particularly
likely.

I love you tons and have had a great time.  I've
learned some about myself, and I see why this travel
thing is necessary in my life.  (necessary = critical)
but I'm not sure if I can explain it all yet.

I've had great trouble getting money, but I know how
to do it now.  No one will accept the AE banking card.
 But I can put cash on my MC; I hope it's not going to
cost a whole lot.  I think I've found a way to put
money on it with no charge at all.  (except for the
money.)

Huge hugs and huge love to you, my dear friend.

You are the best best best.  :-)!

Oh; I went to a rave last night and it was pretty good
considering it was a Monday night, when people should
be getting ready for school or work!  I was
propositioned for sex, asked for drugs, and asked if I
was from Denmark.  No way, got none, false.

Everyone here has a cell phone, and their ringers are
extremely cooler than ours.  Bronwyn even has a
hologram for the face of her phone.  Maybe we can get
those too, but I've just not seen them.  

I have pics of Big Ben, Westminster Abbey (I think),
The London Eye, Salvador Dali statue, all with KTRU
sticker prominently in the frame.  Funny.  :-)

I'm having trouble hanging up with you.  Maybe that's
why I shouldn't call.  Maybe that's why I should. :-)

     With Love
      - Rob!

<p>Bryn's at her university now.  It seems 95% likely that this is
where she'll go unless something really surprising comes up that makes
her realize she can't possibly attend here.  She's really enjoyed the
huge cultural diversity and the laid-back-ness of people here.  Quite
cool.</p>

<p>My ankle is 97% fixed; this is the second full day I've been running
around without my crutches.  I turned them in at the hospital yesterday
and the nurse said it was brilliant that I brought them back.  That's
their way of saying awesome, I'm sure.</p>

<p>I'm at an internet cafe "easyEverything" which has
a realtime £/hour calculator to determine how much
time a single £ will purchase. It's according to the
number of users online in their store I believe. 
cool.</p>

<p>On this keyboard,</p>

<pre>
Shift 2 is "
Shift 3 is £
'@#~ are to the right of ;
</pre>

<p>I injured my ankle (tore a ligament) two days ago
(on my first full day) and went to the ER.  2 X-rays
and 2 crutches, and 2 days later, I'm much better. 
I'm taking the crutches back to the hospital
today.</p>

<p>But first, I plan to find <a
href="https://www.whatshouldiputonthefence.com">The
Fence</a> on which I place my Magic Rob briefcase
presented to me with love from YAC and especially the
Bibby's at Plano rally in 2001.</p>

<p>this is my first of two days alone in the city.  I have found The Fence and took a picture of The Keys which have been featured on the site for a while.  Interesting to me:</p>

<ol><li>there is not actually a sign on the fence.  There are a few signs along a nearby fence, but not this one.</li>
<li>The keys haven't been cut off by the fence owner.</li></ol>

<p>I took a train from the fence to the hospital to return the crutches.  As I approached the hospital, I found that it was right next to the London Eye!  I hadn't seen it up close yet but (*), so I walked over to it, and got this fun picture of Big Ben clock tower and the Abbey (?) and my hat blew off during the picture taking, but I didn't stop to get it; the shot was obviously more important and I glanced at my hat which had just blown off my head to have a rest on the sidewalk, and was not running across the street.  I finished the shot and a young woman picked up my hat as she walked by and offered it to me with a smile, and I said, 'thanks, love' as they do it UK and it really sounded funny with  my US accent and not like 'thanks luv' but hey it's all good; I got the pic and my hat's still on, jack. (**)</p>

<p>So now I'm in a cafe just outside the Dalí exhibit, which is a great surprise because it was on my list of things to hopefully do (the exhibit, not the cafe) and I hadn't looked up its location yet, but it's right by the London Eye, across the river from Big Ben</p>

<p>(*) adding but to the end of a sentence is something I've begun to pick up from Bryn who got it in OZ.</p>

<p>(**) 'hat's still on, jack' as a reference to Bill Cosby's description of his cowboy hero, Buck Jones.</p>

<p class=date>1:40 pm</p>

<p>I just overheard that the London Eye costs 10 quid (***).  I'm not doing that without my brother or dude or Jason or someone who will enjoy it with me.</p>

<p>(***)  Quid = pound like dollar = buck</p>

<p>timing is everything?</p>

<p>I got to ride on the trains a lot today.  I got to
the place where I can get a massage for £20 per hour,
but that was only in February; in March it's £30 per
hour, but it's only on Thursdays.</p>

<p>Doh.</p>

<p>I went to the American Express Bank, but I got
there at after they closed at 3:30pm ("half three"
they say)</p>

<p>And I have 7 minutes remaining on my easyEverything
login.  Fortunately, that's enough time to finish this
entry.</p>

<p>I was wrong about one thing though; my time is
decreasing faster as more people are on this system.
When I logged off the first time (earlier in the day)
I had 50 minutes remaining and £.52 on my card. When I
logged on now, I had only 18 minutes for £.52.  What's
up with that?  Hmph I say. Hmph.</p>

<p>I did get to see the Salvador Dali exhibit, which
was overwhelming to my senses. I've decided he was
mad.  Even though he says he wasn't.  Wow to that
art.</p>

<p>The name of this entry (time) is for Dali, who
often created art depicting the majesty of time over
humans.

<p>I went to a rave last night, where a girl smiled big at me while we
were dancing and then subsequently approached me, put her arms on my
shoulders and said, "I want to cuddle" and then something, and I was
all, "I'll dance with you, but that's it."  She asked if I was drunk
(not like, Oh my gosh you don't want to cuddle; you must be drunk) and
then asked if I knew anyone that could help her get something.  (As I
type this, "ABC" by The Jackson Five is being fed through the speakers
at this internet cafe.  Same one I was at yesterday, but this time I
purchased a 24 hour pass for £4.  Now it's "(I can't get no)
satisfaction" by whoever sings that.)  I was all, "um, no, but good
luck."  Then she's all, "are you from around here?"  I told her no and
it turns out she's from Chicago.  She backed off and then when she left
she gave me a cheek to cheek kiss and "nice to meet you."  "You too." 
mwah!</p>

HI

If I put something on the fence and the owner decides
to remove it before you take a picture, will you
accept a digital photo that I've taken of it?

Thanks so much!

ps: I'm in London from US (Houston) on holiday and
will be adding a lovely old briefcase that says "MAGIC
ROB" on it.  Maybe tomorrow (Monday 18 March) or
Wednesday.

Thanks!   

- Rob

<p>Good morninig London on our first full day to greet the city!  I will definitely be back here to visit.  Last night I talked to Sam, a kiwi (New Zealander) who has been living in London for  years I think, and if I understood correctly, will be applying for UK citizenship and a UK passport sometime soon.   I'm not sure how all hat works, but it seems with a UK passport, whe could more easily scoot around Europe.  She said she's homesick though.  she lives on the south Island of NZ.  There are three islands.  I don't remember all the details she gave.</p>

<p>I woke up and while collecting my clothes, etc to take a shower, Bryn  emerged down the stairs wit Tanja soon after.  We'll all be showered soon and embark on our day.</p>

<p>Oh, Sam heard that we'll be in Paris for 5 days, and she was like '5 days?  That's to much time; you'll get bored tehre!  You should got up to Belgium or ..' somewhere else, but I forgot where she suggested.  The funny thing is that she admitted she has never been to The Loure 'Or however you say it' she said.  I think we'll find enough to do!/p>

<p>What else....???   Um, so we are planning to see The Lion King tonight, and to scope out the Lodon Eye (huge ferris wheel), and London Tower, and Big Ben today.   Turns out Big Ben is the name of the bell in the tower that I have come to associate with the name Big Ben.  I thought it was the whole tower, or the clock t least, but it's just the bell.  Just a huge ass bell, but you know.</p>

<p>I have expressed interest in seeing Stonehenge, and Graham suggested that I rent a car (they call it hire a car, I think) and drive my ass out there for a two day trip and check out a couple of other sites and stay at a B&B.  I'm pretty open to this idea, but a bit nervous about driving in Lonndon proper.  I will likely be more comfortablew with the idea in a couple days, so I may do this.</p>

<p>Bryn will be staying the night at Richmond University on Monday night I thinnk, so I may do it on Monday and Tuesday.</p>

<p>My left shoulder has an amazing kink in it.</p>
