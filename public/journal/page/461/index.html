<p>Have arrived back at Marta's house; she was feeling ookey and
wanted to go home tonight instead of tomorrow, which would have been
my preference, but it's all good.  We got a bit delayed after eating
Taco Bell in some Oklahoma town (possibly Beeline) when Scott's check
engine light came on and we drove back a few miles to get a quart of
oil at Wal-Mart cause everything else was closed.</p>

<p>Played many rounds of Jackie Purdy's Game, and Marta kept winning
easily with all her theatre experience and musicals, etcetera.  I even
cheated and used different lines from the same Eminem song and she
still won.</p>

<p>Lots of "Whose house?  Run's house!!  I said whose house???  Run's
house!  Say what say what?  Martin!  Martin!" and variants including
lines from Southpark movie ("HII DEE ho.....") and everything funny we
could think of.  Good stuff.</p>

<p class=date>1:14am</p>

<p>Just watched a few more episodes of the Simpsons.  Time for bed.</p>

<p>I'm sitting up on the unfinished third level of Tanner's tree house
behind his house.  I can't really say it's Tanner's tree house; I'm
sure his brother and dad have worked on it equally well.  It's a cool
house.</p>

<p class=date>12:42pm</p>

<p>Wow!  Amelia is here!  Mattboy and Kevin are here and now Tanner is
joining us.  Man, who told him about this place?</p>

<p>There is a rope growing inside a tree; apparently a tornado came
through and blew the rope through the tree.  Amazing.</p>

<p>Oh my gosh.  I thought I just deleted *all* the Tulsa Rally journal
entries.  Both days and Silent Football and the crazy story of
Calder's and all that wonderfulness.</p>

<p>I actually did delete them all, but fortunately I had just copied
them from another location.  And I don't know any way to get them back
when deleted via rm on command line.  Aw fuck that was scary.</p>

<p>I deleted an entry called 30Denton, but I dunno if I have copied it
to my site already.  But it's okay; I didn't really do all that much
except watch 3 episodes of Simpsons with Marta.</p>

<p>Okay, I'm going to get the fuck off my computer and take a shower
and sleep.</p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, this game of Silent Football is about to
commence. Our dictator for this game is, as usual, Rob Nugen, and our
note taker is Ben B. The players for this game are as follows:
<br>Amy Baby
<br>Miss Psycho Sexy
<br>Tikki Master
<br>Lady Athena
<br>Mr. I Have a Cool Name
<br>Rowboat
<br>I'm thinking
<br>Bartleby
<br>and Happy Shrugs a Lot</p>

<p>Happy Shrugs a Lot - "I was listening! I WAS LISTENING!!"</p>

<p>Mr. I Have a Cool Name - "A less embodied char of empty penance points for saying 'he'"</p>

<p>Bartleby - "Bartleby has enough trouble keeping $2000," pause, "3?? </p>

<p>Mr. IHCN accusing Bartleby "quote $3000 worth of computer, blah blah
blah, it it it, unquote"</p>

<p>Customary it it it it it it</p>

<p>Happy Shrugs a Lot's name changed to Frontega</p>

<p>Amy enters as Fandango</p>

<p>Customary I'm MC speller and like to spell, S-P-E-L-L spells spell!</p>

<p>Customary we got shroop, yes we do, we got shroop, how 'bout you?
<em>SHROOOP!</em></p>

<p>Miss Amy Baby - "Mr. Shlong-Tots!" which was incredibly cute.</p>

<p>Frontega tries to relieve herself and Fandango of penance points,
Mr. Dictator - "Preposterous!"</p>

<p>Bartleby's bad puns aren't funny.</p>

<p>I'm thinking looses the sacred football for eternity into the black
hole that was Happy Shrugs a Lot</p>

<p>"All I want to do is do a fwap fwap fwap and a quack quack, jump shake
your rump!"</p>

<p>Mr Dictator, what the hell is Bartleby doing?
Receiving a half penance point!</p>

<p>Rowboat preforms a very cute thumbs up shrug</p>

<p>Mr. Dictator does a booty dance!!!</p>

<p>Two way worm hole between the sacred football hogging I'm Thinking and
Mr. IHCN.</p>

<p>Mr. IHCN - "Has anyone ever REALLY played with a wormhole?"</p>

<p>Mr. IHCN must 5 times recite "Never shrug a shrotem/shrotem a shug" It
is impossible describe in text how funny this is.</p>

<p>I'm Thinking becomes I'm Not Thinking because, quite frankly, she
isn't exactly.</p>

<p>Miss Amy Baby - "<em>Mr. Dictator!</em>"</p>

<p>Emperor One Eyed Snake, Saving Grace of the Irish.</p>

<p>Joel falls off of stage. "What just broke?" "Joel did!"
Calder - What happened? Joel - I fell off the stage.</p>

<p>Miss Amy Baby totally misses the fact that there is now a wormhole
between Mr. Dictator and Lady Athena</p>

<p>spread 'em!

<p>im a  maniac maniac on the floor.  and im dancing like ive never danced
before.</p>

<p>ellen is neither a black hole nor in the game.  crazy.</p>

<p>nuttin-pat</p>

<p>SHRUGFEST!!!  YEA!!!</p>

<p>robs computer is a cutie.</p>

<p>mr shaft tots.  yea!  shaft*</p>

<p>customary g-n-u spells gnu.</p>

<p class=date>5:28am</p>

<p>I just gave the dictatorship to Calder.</p>

<p>The game is losing energy I think.  this is rob typing now.  Shit I
just stole the football from Madame Dictator.</p>

<p class=date>5:39am</p>

<p>Now I have just zoomed the football since no one would do sumpin.</p>

<p>tiki master is now a black hole due to rapid falling asleep.</p>

<p>mr. i have a cool name resigns to sleep, leaving the game with only
four players..</p>

<p>welcome fandango, bye fandango.</p>

<p>rolling golf balls everywhere!!!</p>

<p>meow....hairballs!</p>

<p>fandango is back in tha game.</p>

<p>and thunder rabbit is still wasting the universe's time,
accompanied by madame dictator.</p>

<p>new quote of the day: it's not the size of the love that counts,
it's the size of the dic-tator.</p>

<p>miss psycho sexy, after having her name changed from miss psycho
sexy to miss burps a lot, and now has had a new name change to miss
doesn't want to burp a lot which amkes the universe sad.</p>

<p>miss doesn't want to burp a lot which makes the universe sad now
has only 3.0.</p>

<p>thunder rabbit has provided the universe with an extraordinarily
foul odor that will forever ruin the air supply.</p>

<p>no he didnt</p>

<p>yes he did</p>

<p>the game ends with a spilled root beer due to thunder rabbit's
severe lack of motor skills and his carelessness for the feelings of
others.</p>

<p>yea we didnt
<br>no we did
<br>yea we didnt
<br>no we did
<br>yea we didnt 
<br>no we did
<br>wait..penis...huh?

<p>Good morning!  Beastie Boys playing downstairs on the
phonograph!!  Hahahaha</p>

<p class=date>9:24am</p>

<p>I tossed some bites of scrambled eggs to Fred and he missed them,
but one plop hit him on the forehead. hahah</p>

<p>Last night when Laura Nagel arrived after her long ass drive from
Houston, and she was sitting in the driver's seat of the van, looking
toward the passenger side, with her door open, I gymnastically climbed
in and was practically straddling her before she noticed me.
Hahhaahaa!</p>

<p>Wow!!  9 youth came from Springfield Missouri!  And 2 from
Witchita??  Oh, Witchita Falls maybe.</p>

<p class=date>10:22am</p>

<p>Jordan from House, New Mexico is here helping with the wedding.
Nice.</p>

<p class=date>10:25am</p>

<p>Sydney is a bit deleriously silly right now.</p>

<p class=message>My name is Bob Bob Bob
<br>and I'm from Prague Prague Prague
<br>I have no job job job
<br>but I have a dog dog dog
<br>his name is Bob Bob Bob
<br>he has some frogs frogs frogs 
<br>who are named Bob Bob Bob
<br>they live on a log log log...</p>

<p>etc. Funny.</p>

<p class=message>Chorus: Candy Land, Trojan Man</p>

<p class=message>my ex peed into a can, but then he saw me,
so he couldn't pee, cause he got horny.</p>

<p class=message>Chorus.</p>

<p class=message>Save me from, God's evil plan, cause I got drunk, and
decided to fuck, that stupid bastard.</p>

<p class=message>Chorus.</p>

<p class=message>I joined the fucking devil's clan</p>

<p class=message>Chorus.</p>

<p class=message>Damn.</p>

<p class=date>10:43am</p>

<p>It appears we will be playing a game of Silent Football.</p>

<p class=date>10:44am</p>

<p>Rob = Mr Dictator
<br>Sydney = Mistress Scarlett
<br>Steven = Mr Potato Fornicate
<br>Torrey = Miss Lippenshields
<br>Phat Pat = I'm not going to remember any of these
<br>Reese = Mr Lucky Squirrel
<br>Scottie = El jefe taco with a K
<br>Levi = Mr Bubble Gum man
<br>Connie = I don't know</p>

<p>Pat couldn't remember someone's name, and he knew he would get a
1/2 penance point, so once he got the first 1/2 penance point, and the
person made another error Pat said, "the person in custody..." instead
of "the person 2 places to my left" again.</p>

<p>Pat jumped into the middle of the circle to grab the football that
had been passed back and forth ridiculously multiple times.</p>

<p>Sydney and Levi wouldn't booty dance for zooming zoomed zooms, so I
gave Sydney a penance point and made Phat Pat dance, and then when
Levi wouldn't dance, I made him sing and everyone dance.  We all
bumped booties.</p>

<p>I'm glad Connie played; it was her first game.</p>

<p>No wormholes.</p>

<p>Pat kept doing wacky fwaps and then looking at the wrong person to
confuse people.  Funny stuff, especially after he started looking at
the right person and messing people up that way too.</p>

<p class=date>12:20pm</p>

<p>Whitne has had a Mac since 1979.  Wow.</p>

<p>Her name is so long that the y got lost on her name while in
college.  Her last name took up more space than the y could
handle.</p>

<p>Whitne's sister Courtney was very pregnant and had henna painted
onto her belly while pregnant.  I said, "It will be like a shrinky
dink.."  Courtney got sunburned while hennaed, so now she has a
reverse sunburn of the henna design on her belly.</p>

<p class=date>12:47pm</p>

<p>Whitne just told us that peeps in Japan ride huge ass logs down
mountains in an annual crazy log down mountain riding ceremony!
WOWW!!!!</p>

<p class=date>3:25pm</p>

<p>Talked for about an hour with Whitne, Kelly, and um, that other one
whose name I've forgotten and Fred.</p>

<p>Most fun part was sharing stories of brushes with famous concert
people from Tori Amos to others, to Fred's technique for jumping the
fence to get into the front stage area of concerts.  Pretty
sneaky.</p>

<p>Then I joined the movie room and watched the bulk of Spaceballs,
which I had never previously seen.  Pretty funnny stuff.</p>

<p>In the scene where the well dressed bad guy tells the Dark Helmet
bad guy to not have his mask down because he could be making faces,
and then the mask is lifted and he is making faces, I was all, "that's
you Edward [Lerner]."  Funny.</p>

<p>l<p class=date>4:08pm</p></p>

<p>Fun just now playing follow the leader on the playground equipment
outside with Scottie from Oklahoma, and Reese from Corpus Christi.</p>

<p>Then fun with some ragatag sound effects on the organ with Laura,
Rowboat, and Mattboy.  I danced a mild version of Rob's Crazy
Dance.</p>

<p>Touchgroup meeting now and we are deciding who goes on social
action.  Ooh now we are doing the name and pizza topping game.</p>

<p>Noah joined our circle and we made Claire guess what type of pizza
he likes so she guessed Meat Lovers and was correct.  When it was
Cody's turn, he was all, "... and that's Noah, he likes
meatloaf..."</p>

<p class=date>4:21pm</p>

<p>Now Laaura is making up a song about wanting to be Kate.</p>

<p>Oh, nevermind, it's a Benfolds Five song.</p>

<p class=date>5:41pm</p>

<p>We played Jackie Purdy's Game before social action of picking up
newspaper around the neighborhood, and bouncing around a golf ball
that Skyler found in a gutter and I subsequently got it out.  Fred and
I read 3 Sundays worth of comics and played around inside and outside
of Bill's pickup truck while he drove slowly through the parking lot.
I bounced the golf ball on the pavement (actually Amy Wakoviak was
driving) and I was quite entertained that the ball bounced back up to
me and appeared to be going straight up and down, though from the
point of view of the parking lot was probably bouncing with 10 or 15
foot wavelength.  Excellent physics.</p>

<p class=date>6:46pm</p>

<p>Been playing a bit (and losing) but mostly watching Kenny vs Edward
playig super golf 3 or something.  Funny game with good instant
replays.  I'm going to get some dinner and try to find Mikey to play
follow the leader with him outside.</p>

<p class=date>7:15pm</p>

<p>Just played follow the leader with Mattboy, Noah, David McQ, and a
guy whose name I don't know (he wears black boots).  Everyone (almost)
got to lead some, and it was definitely strenuous and fun fun fun.</p>

<p>Dunno where Mikey was except "with Erica."</p>

<p>Now we are assembly for what is apparently going to be an agony
meeting before dinner.  I'm guessing it will be something the Chris
tries to lead.  We'll see how it goes.</p>

<p>Well, at least Gram and Ben are the ones getting people's
attention.</p>

<p>Wow.  Erica is up front starting the meeting.  What a change from a
couple years ago.</p>

<p>What?  This is about OKC rally?  Weird.</p>

<p class=date>7:31pm</p>

<p>Hmm.. very interesting; I've not seen this before.  Some youth were
drinking at OKC and have been given community service, and are not
being identified to the community.  Interesting how youth empowered
this seems to have been; excellent job, my beloved YAC!</p>

<p class=date>8:25pm</p>

<p>Awesome to see Stacy Craig, the previous paid youth director at All
Souls.  Big hugs from her and got to see her twins.  She says that Bob
Gupton taught her Silent Football.</p>

<p><em>Excellent</em> soy drink shared with Laura and Hethre.  Laura's
expression went from shock/surprise to wonderful happy delight.</p>

<p class=date>8:31pm</p>

<p>Now we're watching a fantastic set of photos from Marlin's
fantastic bicycle trek across Japan and China and Mongolia and all
kinds of wild shit.  He just showed us a yert!!</p>

<p>Holy fucking shit this is SO COOOOOLL!!  My God this is
<em>EXACTLY</em> what I want to experience!!!!  They knew *nothing* of
Chinese or Tibetan language and this is just so incredible!!  Fucking
A.  Wow.</p>

<p>"They use elephants like billboards.." drape a sheet over it and
advertise the latest toothpaste or snake oil or whatever..</p>

<p class=date>9:18pm</p>

<p>Holy shit this is so amazing!</p>

<p class=date>9:19pm</p>

<p>Oh man..   some of the towns converted to unitarianism in like
budapest and stuff and they painted over the old frescos on the
walls.  ooohhh  man..</p>

<p class=date>9:39pm</p>

<p>For sixty five dollars Marlin had some guys repair his bike that
had been totally shredded by a tractor - spokes destroyed and cranks
destroyed and frame broken.  spokes and sprockets had to be hand made
and frame was aluminum and had to be repaired .. so amazing.  The guys
who heard how much they paid were all "oh you got ripped off" which is
a totally amazing statement on our economy, but I can't tell what it
says exactly - something like what we think is a trivial amount of
money is a huge amount of money to another culture...  I'm not sure if
that all makes sense, but maybe...</p>

<p class=date>9:43pm</p>

<p>Wow.  UUism is so completely incredibly connected and awesome; I am
so enthused and happy to have such connections.</p>

<p class=date>10:11pm</p>

<p>HOLY SHIT!!!  That is so uber fantastic it's like starting out in
Japan making some bling is <em>exactly</em> how he started his trek.
Fuck!!  Wow!!!  I'm completely utterly *<em>thrilled</em>* at the
prospects of beginning such an adventure myself.  Wow.
wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. wow!!!!</p>

<p class=date>3:23am</p>

<p>I slept through part of the dance and most of the worship and part
of the talent show, most notably not the part when Phat Pat, Mattboy
and I did Three Headed Wonder.</p>

<p>Silent Football now.</p>

<p>Chillin' in Denton today, will mostly do computer stuff while Marta
is in school and such.</p>

<p>Tulsa Rally tonight!  I will be taking Jackie Purdy after her thing
at school ends no earlier than 9pm, though she won't know what time it
will end until later today.  I talked with her last night while
driving to Denton.  Got directions to her school and all that.</p>

<p class=date>11:28am</p>

<p>Have just accompanied Marta to her school for an appointment,
during which I read WIRED magazine January 2002 issue.  Some cat is
hoping to start a new internet economy based on <a
href="https://www.e-gold.com">gold standard</a>.</p>

<p class=date>12:09pm</p>

<p>I have just read their user agreement.  I think I'll open an
account.</p>

<p>Oh shit, hey Fred check this out (not that you ever read my
journal, but hey): they're using an SRK passphrase thing to allow
entering the password via mouseclicks on a randomly changing keyboard
displayed on the screen.  Nice.</p>

<p>It was too cumbersome to use with a bunch of symbols in my password
though, so I took a risk and entered my password using my keyboard.
Whew!</p>

<p>Aight, join the fun and create your own <a
href="https://www.e-gold.com/e-gold.asp?cid=614540">e-gold</a> account!
Hooray!</p>

<p>Picked up Kate Dempsey then Jackie on the way to Tulsa.  Jackie has
a big school.  Big.  Like the size of a Community College.</p>

<p>We almost got run over by an 18 wheeler, who had his brights on
behind us really close for no reason cause we were in the right hand
lane and the left hand lane was available to him to pass us.  We got
his number and reported him.  "But feel free not to talk to him now,
since he's only about a mile behind us."  "Okay."</p>

<p>Got lost on the way here; soon after the truck fiasco, we
apparently missed an exit to the Indian Nation Turnpike.  But thanks
to Ann McDermott (sp) who got us directions over the phone.</p>

<p>Thanks to the girl at the Muskogee gas station who gave us a short
cut to the Muskogee turnpike.</p>

<p>Thanks also to Chris Medlock (can I believe it?) who got us to
Peoria from the Muskogee turnpike.</p>

<p class=date>2:48am</p>

<p>The phonograph downstairs is skipping.</p>

<p>Calder has just telephoned me on my cellie.  Amazing how connected
we can be.  Yup.  It's an opportunity for our culture to catch up to
the connectedness of technology.</p>

<p class=date>2:52am</p>

<p>When we arrived, Scottie and Asha were the first to greet us.  Asha
has cut her hair and taken up guitar as a hobby.</p>

<p>More hugs from peeps and I forgot Cole's name, but Calder typed it
on the computer for me while I was trying to look up my latest mugbook
quote from my Pulp Fiction cache of mugbook quotes.  "I gotta know
what a five dollar shake tastes like."</p>

<p class=date>5:31am</p>

<p>I slept through most of opening circle, which was
anti-youth-empowering by having an adult do the convenant process, and
certainly not as powerful as a youth doing it.  Why would the youth
adhere as well to a covenant directed by an adult?  It's idiocy.</p>

<p>I was fully asleep when they put together touch groups, so I didn't
hear my name called.  Rowboat (I think) came and got me.  I will give
them this: the touchgroup selection process was fantastic in its
randomness and its ability to keep the groups together as they left
the room.  All the names were put in pots (youth and adult separate)
and then names were drawn at random by touchgroup leaders.  Then the
groups left the room.  Excellent.</p>

<p>Our touchgroup was pretty tired, so we played a single round of 2
truths and a lie including saying our correct name, but Laura said 3
truths because she couldn't think of a lie.  Funny.  I don't remember
the names of new people in my group.</p>

<p>"Man, that closing circle was long."  Laura: "closing circle??"
"Yeah, it was so long it's time to go home now!"</p>

<p>Erica Nagel came in to gossip a bit after our group dispersed.  We
bitched about how adult run this rally has been so far: adult taking
the pictures for mugbook and adult doing the registration (and that
adult didn't trust that I don't need to put my last name on the piece
of paper to go into the touchgroup selection bowl for people to know
who ROB! is).  It's some fucked up repugnant shit (not the part about
my name; that's just icing).</p>

<p class=date>5:48am</p>

<p>I'm going to bed.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>In an area with a shallow pool and I was surprised to
see some cats sitting patiently at the bottom of the pool.  I surmised
it must be an optical illusion of some sort, but I got into the pool
and it was no trick; there really were cats in there.  I tried to
avoid them as they seemed not too keen on having visitors, but one of
them clawed me in the back of my right hand.  I was able to get my
hand away and then get out of the pool.</p>

<p>Janette and I visited a flea market in Canton, Texas, which is a
weekend long monthly event.  Actually the sellers arrive on Wednesday
and set up and some people come in on Thursday and then melee on
Friday through Sunday morning and throngs of people buy all kinds of
junk.  Okay, not all of it was junk, but some of it certainly was.
Definitely all of it was just stuff.</p>

<p>Two guys had a stand of hundreds of commemerative soft drink
bottles, almost all of which were unopened.  They didn't have any
Texas Aggie 1994 Dr Pepper bottles, or I woulda bought one for
Wende.</p>

<p>One cat had a bunch of marbles with little logos on them.  Soft
drink logos, football teams, specific players' names and jersey
numbers, flags, college emblems, cartoon characters, musicians, tons
of stuff.</p>

<p>One guy (who mostly had a bunch of junk (like a water damaged
cardboard undated political poster for someone I've never heard of)
had some Victrola 78 rpm records, which I went through and found one
that I'll give to Forest, who has a player.  Music is only recorded on
one side.  Fifty cents.</p>

<p>Wow.  Cool stuff in my life.</p>

<p>I've just read my friends' entries on <a
href="https://www.livejournal.com/users/thunderrabbit/friends">livejournal</a>.
not "caught up" by any means, but read the last 25 entries.  I had
been reading them and keeping up about a year+ ago, but quit after I
simply couldn't keep up due to work.  I'm not exactly a workin' man
these days, so I have a bit more time, but I'm trying not to waste all
of it in front of the computer.</p>

<p>Today Janette and I went for a walk and explored inside a two story
house under construction in her neighborhood.  There was a lot of mud
around the back (where we entered) so we spent some time scraping it
off before walking inside on their new (unsealed) hardwood floor.
We're such considerate tresspassers.</p>

<p>We watched <em>Richard Pryor: Alive and Smokin'</em> which is one
of his first stand up comedy things, and he was openly nervous about
the cameras.  Interesting stuff.  And he was harshing on Nixon, which
is so weird cause that shit was current events in 1971.  Funny.</p>

<p>But the best part was that the tape, featuring plenty of
explitives, ended just <em>minutes</em> before Janette's mom-in-law
came over.  Wow.  Excellent timing.</p>

<p class=date>8:53pm</p>

<p>I just made a CD for Janette featuring some Eminem from <em>The
Marshall Mathers LP</em> and Korn from <em>Life is Peachy</em>.  I
accidentally put "I'm a Criminal" on there twice.  Ironic.</p>
