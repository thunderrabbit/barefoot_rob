<p>Tariq and I are creating a game of memory for iOS. This is my first project that uses blocks, and I must agree, they make coding a lot lot easier!!</p>

<p>This is my second big iOS project, a lot of which is based on <a href="https://twitter.com/mhollemans">Matthijs Hollemans</a>&rsquo; game <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/12735/how-to-make-a-simple-playing-card-game-with-multiplayer-and-bluetooth-part-1">Snap</a> (currently without the multiplayer stuff), one of <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/tutorials">Ray Wenderlich&rsquo;s excellent tutorials</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve just gotten the in-game tutorial to work, though its alignment&hellip; isn&rsquo;t. Yay for blocks and tutorials and screenshots!</p>

<p><em>Was in south pacific island and was admiring the piercings of some of the locals.  An older guy held two needles in a downward non-threatening way and nodded his head toward me questioningly.  I was like &ldquo;sure!&rdquo; and approached him.  He  quickly and painlessly inserted needles in either side of my upper lip, then out a bit lower, so they didn&rsquo;t actually pierce into the mouth; just like subcutaneous, but not deeper than that.</em></p>

<p>Today at Tariq&rsquo;s we worked about 4 hours so he bought pizza. Apparently this company is going to put ovens in the delivery vehicles so the pizza cooks <em>on the way</em> to the destination.</p>

<p>He made smaller icons for the menu and I incorporated them. Between arriving home and going to his house, I fixed the timer in each round. At his house, I added a ScoreView based on UILabel.</p>

<p>Things to do include:</p>

<p>Lin&rsquo;s uncle was here this weekend, and he planted the seed of moving to Taiwan instead of Thailand.  I&rsquo;ve never been, but I understand many Taiwanese are super friendly and outgoing, plus the weather is nice and warm.</p>

<p>Lin will look into visas and stuff soon.  yay!!</p>

<p>Though we haven&rsquo;t started thinking about a name, Tariq and I have pretty well fleshed out version one of our first card game (during our 10pm - 12am meeting tonight).  He&rsquo;s still got to create some assets, and I&rsquo;ve still got to do a good amount of programming, but I can clearly tell that my iOS skillz have increased a lot since our first app.</p>

<p>I probably shouldn&rsquo;t write skills with a z; I&rsquo;m miles away from where I might hope to be in a parallel universe.</p>

<p>The game will be a bit difficult!  We plan something like 10 levels, but only chimpanzees will likely be able to finish the higher levels.</p>

<p>Last night we invited <a href="https://balconyofdreams.blogspot.jp/">Cecilia</a> over to the house well we invited her on Sunday and Thursday was her and our mutually available day and Lin prepared lovely Texas BBQ in the form of green salad and carrot soup and bean burgers and bread and butter, lots of butter including raisin butter and the dinner was great and Cecilia a gave us lots of ideas on how to do what she calls permaculture, but it&rsquo;s not in the traditional sense of permaculture just for growing crops, but permaculture lifestyle so I am looking forward to implementing some of those, and hope one of us can attend her <a href="https://balconyofdreams.blogspot.jp/2013/01/the-organising-fairies-how-permaculture.html">upcoming workshops</a> in Roppongi and somewhere else.</p>

<p>I wrote this on <a href="https://750words.com/">750words</a> this morning at 4am.</p>

<p>Just for fun (and because I need to head to work), I&rsquo;ll leave it unedited:</p>

<p>I got a really good set of results from coding in iOS; I used blocks for the first time, incluidng typedef to make them more palatable syntax whise. I&rsquo;ve got a view with a model and it all kinda started with Ray Wenderlich&rsquo;s Snap example or whoever wrote that, but on his site, and I&rsquo;m really thankful for the free stuff, so I believe I shall open source this thing Im making now, a countdown timer that does a visual color change while counting down and while ticking off the ticks by calling blocks sent by the insantiating objected. The thing so far is three objects deep, with the MultiTimerView being the top, and then it instantiates a MultiTimer, which instntiates a plurality of Pausable Timers which themselves instantiate an NSTimer, and I don&rsquo;t know how deep it goes from there. but I am thinking I&rsquo;ll put these guys on github as soon as I have the , um, the shrinking aspect of the image down. I&rsquo;m hoping that I can just add one more timer and an animation of shrinkitude and have it work, but I might have to shrink and change colors with separate timers per each point of time. Not sure how the thing will react to two different threads asking the UIView waht to do.</p>

<p><em>Driving Mr Van with Colleen and my family, we arrived at a place where we had just been druing thew inter.  In winter the stream had lights and snow and looked quite different from no lights and no snow version as it was now.  Colleen commented on that and I was like, &ldquo;yeah that was a once in a lifetime opportunity because I&rsquo;ve heard they&rsquo;re not going to do the lights next year.&rdquo;  We turned right to go into the gated area and it was locked.  I jumped up to examine the lock, and the lock opened as I touched it.  I still had to disconnect the lock from the gate, and I found another button that did so.  They drove the van through after I kicked open the gate, and I was  still hanging on near the lock area but the gate stayed open.  My dad even drove the van on a door frame on the gate to keep it open longer but that didn&rsquo;t help close it as hoped.</em>  Something else and then my alarm rang.</p>
