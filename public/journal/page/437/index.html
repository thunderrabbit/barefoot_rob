<p>At work now; been here since 10:07, according to the timeclock.  A
frustration that I've found here is getting very little direction on
some things, and lots of direction on other things.  For example, I
was asked to screw down the floor where boards were warping upward now
that they are drying after it flooded some weeks ago.  I asked how far
apart the screws should be and Johnny said "just get them down," in
his comforting smooth deep voice.</p>

<p>I grabbed some screws that looked useable, but discovered they were
too long; they hit the concrete before their heads touched the floor.
So I got the right sized screws and got to work.  Later I was informed
that I should screw the screws in at an angle, and that I should screw
in "closer to the edge" than I had been.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>When .. nevermind; who cares.  I don't wanna focus on negativity at
work.</p>

<p>Wow.  I checked in with Josephine and learned that Jackie Purdy has
selected me to shave her head with my clippers.  What a wonderful
blessing!  I called Jackie and confirmed a time - 6pm tonight at the
Bibby's.</p>

<p>I asked Johnny if I could get off work at that time, and he seemed
really impressed that I asked ahead of time instead of just telling
him at 6pm, "I'm leaving now," or worse, simply leaving without saying
bye.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Okay.  Perfect timing as Jackie and I drove up literally at the
same moment.</p>

<p>I asked how she was doing, to get a gauge on whether or not we
should do this.  She said, "excited."</p>

<p><a href="/images/peeps/Jackie_Purdy/jackie_before.jpg">before</a>.</p>

<p>I took a shower while Josephine <a
href="/images/peeps/Jackie_Purdy/jackie_braids.jpg">braided Jackie</a>'s hair.</p>

<p>Jackie got nervous and a bit giddy.  We cheered her on with her
decision and she took the first wack at a braid.  Jackie, Josephine,
Jack, and I each cut off one braid.</p>

<p><a
href="/images/peeps/Jackie_Purdy/jackie_braidless.jpg">braidless</a>.</p>

<p>The funniest thing (besides the whole thing) was Jack, when at this
point he said, "Okay, are you sure you wanna go through with this?
This is your <a

chance</a>."</p>

<p>Hahahahaha!</p>

<p>We all agree that her new do looks <a

<p>I just went to the corner store for some Dr Pepper and KitKat Bites
(to go with my two peanut butter sandwiches for protein).  On the way
back a cat said, "hey man, buy me a soda.." and I was all, "naw
man... you wanna drink?"  He did, "Aw yeah, I'm soo thirrsty!" and he
got the first chug on my liter DP.  I wondered if it burned his mouth
a lot to chug so much, especially when it's cold outside and the coke
is cold as well.</p>

<p>Got back to Wolf Shop and all the doors were closed and only my car
was in the parking lot.  "Awww man..." I went through different
scenarios in my head.. the only thing of value in the shop is my
<em>computer</em>, which of course in a mere $3000 worth of hardware,
plus the entries I've written but not yet put online... I pulled on
the door expecting it not to open, but it did.  Ahhh.</p>

<p>As we pulled in the parking lot around 9pm, I jokingly said, "let's
wait until we're the last ones here..." since we were *Almost* the
last ones there last time.  We thought we were and were all, "yes!!!"
as we left thinking we were the last ones in the store, and then as we
left we saw a guy go up to the counter!  Man.  We thought bad thoughts
at him and laughed and went on our way.  That was the night we rented
<em>April Fool's Day</em>.</p>

<p>Jack and I just got back from the video store.   We took forever in
there, wandering about, mostly in the drama section, trying different
techniques of selecting a movie, including randomly choosing an aisle,
a set of shelves, a particular shelf, and which box to select, and
rejected the result: a comedy starring Bill Murray who inherits a
circus elephant, sells it to the highest bidder and has a wacky
adventure driving the elephant across country.</p>

<p>As I lay on the floor, I noticed a movie starring Adam Horovitz
(sp) (?) about a motorcycle adventure and I then decided to get the
Beastie Boys movie, the cover of which just says "BEASTIE BOYS" in big
3D letters like a monolithic structure.  As I reached for the box,
Jack said, "I have an idea: we can have a race..."</p>

<p>"I'm getting the Beastie Boys ...and see who gets a movie first?" I
simultaneously interrupted and finished his sentence.</p>

<p>"Yes," smiled Jack the way he smiles when something is ironic.
"stupidest idea ever..."     "Okay, you got something; let's go."</p>

<p>But we didn't go, and he suddenly jumped and did a 180 in the air
and was all, "have you seen... the war of the buttons?"</p>

<p>"No, what's it about?"</p>

<p>He picked up the box.  "It's about these kids, apparently, and
there's a war.."</p>

<p>"Have you seen it?"</p>

<p>"No, it was just the first thing I saw when I turned around."</p>

<p>hahahahaahahaha!</p>

<p>And when we got to the counter, I was all, "is it 10 o'clock yet?"</p>

<p>"Ten ten."</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>We were the last ones in the store.</p>

<p>Took Janette and Charity to the airport today.  Lots of turns and
stopsigns to get there a sneaky way, but I don't think it was shorter
than just driving down Mockingbird.  I was able to get back in 15
minutes, while I think it took 20 minutes to get there.. Anyway, who
cares..  they got to the airport on time.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>At Northwoods last week Drew Barrymore had come to
visit and that she might come this week as well!  I wondered if it
would be worth it to drive the hour to church to possibly see her
(she's my girlfriend, but I just haven't told her yet), but it was
predicted that she wouldn't likely be there.</p>

<p class=dream>I ended up not going.</p>

<p>Rockfacejack had a <a
href="https://www.livejournal.com/talkread.bml?journal=fancyboy&itemid=9227">contest</a>
today on LJ.  I solved it by entering all the names of the birds in
google, and clicking [I'm Feeling Lucky] to get <a
href="https://www.50states.com/bird/">this page</a>.</p>

<p>I knew from yesterday that he had been talking about certain
states.  And the birds linked them all.</p>
