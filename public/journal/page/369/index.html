<p>Earlier I called Ç±Ç± but did not leave a voice mail.  She just now
called me back and I explained that her mom's bike got towed and I
lost my wallet and therefore couldn't pick it up.  Fun thing is that
somehow I pressed a button on my phone so that the conversation was recorded; I
could transcribe it if I wanted.  The only reason to transcribe it though
would be to capture her reaction when I told her "when I went to get
the bike, I lost my wallet."</p>

<p>It was a laugh that simultaneously said "oh jeez what else could go
wrong?" and "I feel your pain" and "it will be all good."</p>

<p>She said she will help me get it tomorrow.</p>

<p>I wonder how I can repay the favor.</p>

<p>I really really really hope I can get cash (and a new chain
wallet?) before I see her tomorrow.</p>

<p>Time to study.</p>

<p>Magically, I got on the same bus with the same driver that I used
to get here.  He remembered me when I was all like, "maybe not same
bus" to indicate that maybe it wasn't this bus, hoping that explained
why my wallet isn't here.</p>

<p>All the explaining was done at the end of the line (we were close
to the end of the line (like 2 stops away) at the Bike Pound stop)
where I now have the opportunity to wait (study) 45 minutes (I think)
before it's time for the bus to go again.</p>

<p>I had a good cry alone on the bus (as the driver got out to stretch
and do whatever he does while scared wallet-losing bike-losing gaijin
are on his bus crying) wrote this entry and here I am.</p>

<p>Time to study more Japanese.  and I don't just mean that in the
proverbial kinda way; I'm going to study right</p>

<p>now.</p>

<p class=date>10:25am</p>

<p>Back at home.  The bus started again before I had time to fully
open my book, but on the way home I learned four verbs:</p>

<p>to eat ÇΩÅ◊ÅÈ
<br>to sleep ÅÀÅÈ
<br>to see ÅﬂÅÈ
<br>to get up Å®Ç´ÅÈ</p>

<p>I've dug through everything in my room. No wallet.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Now I'm going back to the police station to tell them what else
I've lost. (phone (recovered), bike, wallet)</p>

<p class=date>12:42pm</p>

<p>Went to the cops, told them my sad tale of woe (they had to call a
bilingual cat on the phone to get my info) and practiced a tidbit of
Japanese with them.  Like "come" "go" and "came" and "little bit"
though these are not yet committed to my memory.</p>

<p>I told them all the items I could remember that are in the wallet:
<br>70,000 yen
<br>gaijin card
<br>TX drivers license
<br>US bank card
<br>Japanese bank card
<br>proof that I can use the bike
<br>my Japan address written in Japanese
</p>

<p>Point is, they'll call me when the wallet is returned.</p>

<p>Part of me wanted to sulk and pout until the wallet was returned - 
to stop all activity and just curl up until the wallet situation fixed 
itself.  I consciously had to choose not to.  All the "success books" 
of all the "successful" people that I've read talk about their wins and 
losses.   And with the losses, the just have to start over.  Just start 
again.  Fine.  I can do it.  Release the outcome.</p>

<p>I decided to start over with a new wallet so I went to the bank with
my bank passbook (checkbook that has a magnetic strip, and the ATM
prints in the passbook my balance and such!) but the ATMs were only
happy to take cards, not passbooks.  They all have passbook slots, but
those didn't seem to be activated.  ATMs in Japan are not open
24-hours.<p>

<p>So...  I cannot yet start over with a new wallet.</p>

<p>I used 110 yen of my remaining change to take a train to pick up a
box from the post office.  The guy there asked for my ID and I
gestured that I didn't have any, but I showed him on my computer my
address in Japan which he confirmed was the address for the package
and let me have the package.  Yay for trust in Japanese culture.</p>

<p>Now instead of my wallet, I have <em>chocolate chip cookies!!</em>  
I'm going to walk home to save 110 yen and I don't think it will be 
<em>that</em> far - just 1 or 1.25 train stops away I believe.</p>

<p>The good thing, no matter how far it is to my apartment - I have
chocolate chip cookies from Janette!!!!</p>

<p>A coin toss encouraged me to walk to ÇµÇÒÅ[ÇÊÇ±ÇÕÇ‹ instead of home.
I did this in search of a bank.  Found a bank but it also wouldn't
take my passbook.   Information phone beside the thing revealed that I
would be able to use the passbook tomorrow.</p>

<p>Walked from ÇµÇÒÅ[ÇÊÇ±ÇÕÇ‹ to home in 40 minutes.</p>

<p>I received a package in the mail yesterday... well, no I
<em>didn't</em> receive a package in the mail yesterday, but I would
have if I had been home at the time the delivery was attempted.</p>

<p>Instead, I have a notice written in all Japanese indicating, I
believe/hope, how I can pick up this package.  I'm gonna call the
number on the notice and see what happens.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Also, as I looked more closely at the sheet I received from the
cops about how I can pick up my bike (if it in fact was towed and not
jacked), I noticed that I could have called them yesterday (Sunday).
The kanji for Sunday looks very similar to Monday, and I figured that,
like in US, Sunday would be a day for sleeping for the Foreigner's
Bikes Towing Society, especially since they had such limited hours and
Saturday was indicated as the day they work least.  But no, that other
line says "Sunday through Friday" not "Monday through Friday"</p>

<p class=date>8:10am</p>

<p>Hmm.  I called the number for the package but got a recorded
message.  I could understand she said "phone number" at one point in
the message.  I'll go to work early and ask the staff, whose names I
will remember can help me.</p>

<p class=date>9:11am</p>

<p>Whoohooo!</p>

<p>Using the cryptography on the notice I received in the mail, I have
successfully navigated my way to the post office in Kikuna to pick up
a package.  And it's from Colleen!!  Thanks, Colleenie Beanie!!</p>

<p>I haven't opened it; it'll take me</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Oh so cute!  A dad playing running with his son out of the post
office, and holding out his arms to pick him up.  Such a big happy
father smile on his face.  I don't see a lot of kid coddling in
Japan... lots of kids carried around or in little bike seats, but
that's the first I-love-my-kid-more-than-the-world smile I've seen
here.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I haven't opened the package; it'll take me several minutes walk
and a crowded train ride before I get home.  And I'll still probably
get to work before 11am, when the staff can call this mysterious
bicycle place.</p>

<p class=date>9:54am</p>

<p>Whoohooo!!!  I'm the luckiest cat in the world!!  An easter basket,
a cute little witty bitty stuffed rabbit and CHOCOLATE!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>Thank you thank you Colleen!!!!!</p>

<p>Crud.  I don't have her phone number in Corpus to call her to say
thanksomuch; I'll call Bibby's and have them IM her or something.</p>

                        <p class=date>12:02am JST Tuesday 29 April 2003</p>

<p>At work, at one point I felt completely devastatingly sad for no
apparent reason, except that I haven't been hugged in over a month and
I'm living in a foreign country with no close friends.. so when I had
my three week evaluation, and Steve said, "you're getting better"
regarding my overall performance, I was nearly like, "dear god oh
thank you thank you," even though under the table I had been giving him
the finger with both hands while listening to him carry on.</p>

<p>God I'm immature for doing that, and a wuss for not telling him
what I think.</p>

<p>Or maybe I'm just coping any way I know how without making too many
waves.</p>

<p>sigh.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>During work, after my evaluation, Carla asked me about it.  And she
seemed truly interested.  Like.. wow.  <em>Really?  you care?</em> I
thought.  I didn't really tell her everything cause 10 other teachers
were in the room and I might have blurted how much I think Steve is a
big weird Nova freak, but I did say that I was told that I'm getting
better, something I didn't expect to hear.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>After that, at some point I was just.... ready to scream or implode
cause I couldn't think of anything helpful to say about the students I 
just had; I couldn't even remember anything from the lesson and I was 
just like in a brain overload freakout state and Carla asked if I was 
okay or something.. oh I know what it was; I had the files she needed 
for her next class and she was like, "are you done with them yet?" and 
I'm like "no; I'm dying here," or something like that, and she was like,
"can I help you get your next files?"</p>

<p>"Oh my god that would be great" and in about 2 seconds, magically
she had gotten all my files *and* noted that I had already chosen
lesson 18 for that class, and she put the folders into an appropriate
lesson binder on page 18.</p>

<p>"Here you go; here's your files."</p>

<p>On the way out of the office, I walked out with Carla and told her
about having successfully navigated to my post office to get a package
from "one of my ex-youth" and I told her about YRUU and how I
supported them so long and how they still love me and send packages
and I'm the luckiest cat in Japan, etc.</p>

<p>As we parted I was like, "really thank you so much for helping me
today" and she was like, "oh no that was easy; it's just cause I've
been doing it for so many years."</p>

<p>(We joke in the office that Carla is turning Japanese, cause she
does a lot of the same mannerisms as the Japanese women do in classes
when they are thinking.  They do a Scooby Doo sounding "rooaeh?" and
now she does too, anytime she hears something confusing or
surprising.)</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Then I was like, "bye" and went through a little fantasy scenario
where I turn her down for any romantic interests because of janette
(and it would be just far too messy to date anyone at work, or even in
Nova at all) even though Carla hasn't done anything vaguely romantic
toward me whatsoever.</p>

<p>Lonely anonymous ride on the way home and found the bus stop where
I'm encouraged to get the bus to get my bike but was too afraid to get
on and talk to the driver and Annie's email in my head "I was afraid"
etc until she just realized it was silly to be afraid and even with
her cheerleading, I couldn't get myself to get on that bus, even
though I knew it was the right bus.  Part of my head argued that it
was a pretty cheap fare and I'd get to expand my horizons and maybe
make a friend, but another part of my head was all, "aw c'mon man it's
late and them fuckers probably aren't open and what if you get lost on
the way home and it's pretty late after a long day at work."  The
second part of my brain won and I went home.</p>

<br>  thanks for staying true even in your make-believe world.  i appreciate it cuz of the obvious resons.  what is not so obvious, maybe, is how you seem to be closer to  conquering a weaker part of yourself, by relating to women on a more person to person mode without sex driven agendas, holding on to a higher integrity for your own highest good.<br>
  (am i assuming too much from this?) that&rsquo;s how it reads from here.  <br>
  good job, mate.</p>

<p>Weird.</p>

<p>The staff says the bike-recovery-directions say something like, "to
get your bike back, start at Å¬Ç»ÇµÅ‹ station and follow these
directions."</p>

<p>But, they were not able to find Tsunashima station on the map on
said piece of paper.</p>

<p>They were able to find the destination on the map, near a high
school.</p>

<p>Apparently the directions include taking a bus, which will be a
first for me in Japan.</p>

<p><em>FOUND</em> on the map where my bike is being held hostage.
It's not exactly walking distance away, but now at least I'll know
where the fuck I am after I get it and will be able to ride home.  I
had to do some kanji pattern matching to figure out where it was, but
I did it.  Alright.</p>

<p>"Yeah I can; I just fuckin' did!"</p>

<p>That's what I said when Steve was all, "now, you can't start
drinking until everyone has a drink!" after I chugged most of my
orange juice when it arrived.</p>

<p>:-P</p>

<p>There.  I got to snap back at Steve a bit cause we're not at work
hahahahahaaha</p>

<p>fast:</p>

<p>Amazing stories from Benny who is all like telling some fucked up
stories about chasing people down who stole plastic pitchers but not
really caring about the pitchers, just the chase.</p>

<p class=date>11:47pm</p>

<p>What a totally great night!</p>

<p>I'm just now on the train in Ç©ÇÌÇ≥Ç´.</p>

<p>Oh oh oh so much fun.  I basically stayed in place at the table
where I originally sat by Bill and chugged orange juice.  Most other
people played musical chairs without any music, except for Phil who
happened to be sitting across from me.  He and I didn't talk a whole
lot though.</p>

<p>I greatly enjoyed learning / showing off my limitedÅ@Ç…ÇŸÇÒÇ≤ prowess to some of the
Ç…ÇŸÇÒÇ∂ÇÒ staff from Nova.
Started with ÇΩÇ◊Ç‹Ç∑ then expanded to
ÇΩÇ◊ÇΩ and from across the table
Ç∑Ç›Ç© saw me and was all, "hey Robsan not so
fast; you can relax a little!" cause she apparently thought the pages
and pages in my notebook had been filled tonight or something.</p>

<p>Ç‰Ç´ couldn't answer all the questions I asked, like how to explain
radicals (which I understand to be portions of kanji) nor something
about how my electronic dictionary explained kanji.  whatever</p>

<p>She confirmed for me something I guessed/knew about kanji - that
once I know some kanji, other kanji will be easier to learn because
their meanings are based on their component kanji.  Like compound
words such as rainbow.</p>

<p>And she helped me understand something about verb conjugation and
gave me a past tense form (add ta to the end)</p>

<p class=date>12:00am</p>

<p>(train has just now started moving; I hope I make it to
ÇﬁÇ≥ÇµÇ±Ç∑Ç¨ before the train line to my house goes
to sleep for the night.)</p>

<p>Ummmmmmmmmmmmmm oh I learned all the names of the Japanese staff:Ç‰Ç´, Ç‹Ç≥Ç–ÇÎ, Ç∆Ç‡Ç±, Ç†Ç‚, Ç∑Ç›Ç©, Ç≠Ç›Ç±, and I hope no others cause
that's all I can barely remember.</p>

<p>For some reason this train seems to be going more slowly than the
trains during rush hour.  Like between the stations it doesn't reach
as high of a speed as the trains I usually ride.</p>

<p>Ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
. . . . .</p>

<p>I dunno.</p>

<p>Oh!  Benny and Carla are two Canadians with a rivalry of sorts
cause Benny likes sports teams from Canada and dramatically denies
Carla's Canadian Blood since she likes teams in the US teams in the
hockey, baseball, and basketball.  Of course, I'm like "dude whatever
who cares" but he obviously has fun caring.</p>

<p>On the way home I met Jonathon (sp) who has just signed his second
year contract with Nova.  We yammered a bit about Niagra Falls since
he lived near there and I was all, "oh, you know that wall on the
Canadian side that sticks out past the falls?"</p>

<p>"yeah..."</p>

<p>"I want to sit on that wall."</p>

<p>He nodded. ..  "it could be done."</p>

<p>Nice.</p>

<p>In 4 hours, happy one month being in Japan anniversary to me.</p>

<p>Damn.  I just went to break while I had a lesson to teach.  Every
day prior to this I have worked four shifts, gotten my lunch, then
worked four more shifts.</p>

<p>Today it was 5 and 3.</p>

<p>Eric was 4 and 4, and since he's a cool cat (and has been here for
a while and seems to handle everything quite smoothly (maybe I should
get input from him about how to be a cool cat) even during the busiest
of times) he covered my shift for me with no apparent difficulty or
stress.  Oh thank goodness no AT was there today (Laura was our boss
today and she could hardly give a rat's butt about anything; she has 6
more days of Nova before she's all "sayonara suckas!" to us when she
goes back to England.</p>
