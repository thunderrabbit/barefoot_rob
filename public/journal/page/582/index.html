<p class=date>3:58am CST Friday 1 December 2000</p>

<p><p>I found myself awake, with a realization of what I must do.  It&rsquo;s
not HUGE, and it won&rsquo;t land me in jail.  In the tradition of ktru, I&rsquo;m
cutting up ktru bumper stickers to make a witty saying.</p>

<p><p>My new ktru bumper sticker will read:</p>

<pre>
ktru died.  call 713-348-4996 to complain!
</pre>

<p><p>That&rsquo;s the phone number of the office of the vice president of
student affairs of Rice University.</p>

<p><p class=date>5:27am</p>

<p><p>I have just finished the sticker.  It looks great!  Now I just need
to put it on my car.</p>

<p><p class=date>6:34am</p>

<p><p>Wow.  That took longer than I thought.  I have just now removed my
old KTRU stickers from my bumper.</p>

<p><p class=date>8:01am</p>

<p><p>Finished.  It looks great.  The sticker takes up the entire length
of my bumper, as the digits of the phone number are pretty large.
It&rsquo;s been exactly 24 hours since the station was murdered.</p>

                        <p><title>Tiffany and Jason</title>
<p class=date>12:28am CST Saturday 2 December 2000</p>

<p><p>The end of my work day went a bit longer than expected, but I got
the Ritz II survey totally done and &ldquo;turned in,&rdquo; meaning it is live
and ready to go on our live web server.  Grreat!!!!</p>

<p><p>But the coolest thing today was getting to see Tiffany and Jason.
Tiffany is down for the weekend from OKC, and they came up to see us
and much dinner tonight.  Conversation was sparse at first, with both
of them apparently on the other&rsquo;s nerves.  Dinner at Hobbit Hole
proved to be wonderfully yummy.</p>

<p><p>On the way back home, my head was totally hurting and I was ready
to send them home.  But we hung out a bit and then it came to light
that Tiffany had a hackey sack.  Awww yeah.  So Jason, Tiffany and I
all laughed a lot and kicked the hackey sack around.  That was tons of
fun.  The game mutated into tossing the sack oer the slowly spinning
ceiling fan blades.  Jason climbed on my back a few times when the
sack got stuck.</p>

<p><p>Then the game progressed to &ldquo;spin while looking up at the ceiling
fan.&rdquo;  The idea is that one spins so that the fan appears to be still
and the world spins around.  Jason got 19 revolutions at first.  I did
23 after that.  Then Tiffany did 27, but we halfway disqualified her
since she spun too fast and then too slowly.  Then Jason got the world
record, and sput 74 revolutions at the same speed as the fan.  He
declared that 40 revolutions is a barrier, and after that the next 20
are free and easy.  When he fell, he said, he didn&rsquo;t know where his
legs were and wondered what his legs were hitting.  His legs were
hitting his own legs.</p>

<p><p>Then we played bouncy ball in the stairs.  That game I totally love
and am thankful that we got to play for so long.</p>

<p>&lt;p class=date 00:43am.  I&rsquo;m so tired I&rsquo;m falling asleep sitting in my
chair.</p>

the door code has been changed and the stickers have all been removed 
from the outside door.  it's over.  and we've lost.


i'm up at the station now and it's not a pretty picture. either we do
something now or not at all, but if we do anything it must be

Subject:  From Dr. Camacho

Dear KTRU volunteers:

As I am sure you are aware, students on duty Tuesday
evening deliberately disrupted the KTRU broadcast of
the Rice University women's basketball game.  This
demonstrated a lack of respect for fellow students
on the basketball team, for a Rice student activity
and for the listeners.  It demonstrated a lack of
responsibility in the use of university-owned broadcast 
facilities.  And  it deliberately subverted programming 
approved by the responsible  university parties,
including the KTRU advisory committee and the Vice
President for Student Affairs, to whom authority to
determine policy is delegated by the President and the
Board of  Trustees, the owners of the FCC license.

As a consequence, the university is reorganizing the
operation of KTRU. During this reorganization,
operation by the current volunteers is suspended 
from 8 a.m., Thursday, November 30 until further
notice.

Dr. Hutchinson and I have accepted an invitation from
Johnny to attend a meeting of the KTRU volunteers at 
6 p.m. this evening.  The decision to reorganize the
operation of the station is final.  The discussion at
this point should be about the opportunities for 
tudent participation in the reorganized KTRU.  We
remain committed to the concept of a university-owned,
student-operated radio station with appropriate lines
of accountability.

Sincerely,
Zenaido Camacho
Vice President for Student Affairs
</pre>

<p><p>Wow, I say.  Wow.  Interesting that I had already
mentioned that I might not apply again for the winter
shift.  Then this morning I decided I would apply.
Now I see this.  I&rsquo;ll still apply, just in case I get
to DJ more.</p>

<p><p>There&rsquo;s been about 150 emails today between DJs about the administration
and all that.  I&rsquo;m leaving now to attend the meeting at 6pm.  I think I&rsquo;ll
wear shoes and <em>maybe</em> park my car off campus.</p>

<p><p>Karla encouraged me to not do anything that will get me arrested.  I
intend not to be arrested.  I&rsquo;m just going to watch and voice my opinion if
appropriate.</p>

<p><p>A lot of people are <b><em>Pissed Off</em></b>, mostly DJs from the
emails, but who knows.  I am certain media will be there, given what people
have emailed today.  Awright &hellip; see ya, and I&rsquo;ll let you know what happens.</p>

<p><p>As I was writing my most recent dream, I remembered my 4am dream.</p>

<p><p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was at my Aunt Mercedes house, and I flushed the
toilet, which overflowed and got poop on the carpet and floor.  I was
all embarassed, but Aunt Mercedes was quite supportive in helping me
get over it: &ldquo;oh, it does that all the time.  Don&rsquo;t worry about it!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>She and my cousin Bridgette cleaned it up even though I
was quite willing to do so (and standing right there).  Mercedes
picked up the white rug and placed it on an old iron pot-bellied stove
to dry.  The rug got singed, making the matter worse in my mind, but
she said again that I shouldn&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>

<p><p class=dream>We were in an small-ish room that was somewhat dark-
like an attic or garage.</p>

<p><p>(note:  Aunt Mercedes died over a year ago or maybe two.)</p>

<p class=date>6:55am CST Thursday 30 November 2000
<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>My friend Mike was talking on the radio to Sam Malone,
a popular DJ in Houston.  Mike was on a roll about something and was
saying some pretty funny stuff.  Then he had to go or Sam had to move
on to something else so Mike was supposed to hang on or call back.
Mike didn&rsquo;t call back in time, so he called back like 20 minutes
later, when they had already moved on past that topic.  So Sam was all,
&ldquo;call back at 7:10, and I&rsquo;l make you my last call.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>I wanted to get in on the action, so I called Sam to
see if I could call at 7:10 as well .  My conversation with Sam was
funny at first, but then when I actually told him I wanted to talk at
the same time as Mike, I was all, &ldquo;you know mike, who was talking
about that thing a while go.&rdquo;  I got no response from Sam. (quite an
unusual occurrence).  So I kept talking myself.  &ldquo;So anyway, why do
they pay you?  To make people happy, and I know you can&rsquo;t make people
happy all the time, but you&rsquo;re totally leaving me hanging here, and
that&rsquo;s okay. I wish you a great day anyway.  See ya!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>I started closing up the beach house where we were
staying; actually it was my dad&rsquo;s house, but two stories tall.  The
room we were in was all old and dilapidated, but still functional.</p>

<p><p>The KTRU meeting essentially answered zero questions, but it gave
us attention from the media.  I will probably be on RBT (Rice
Broadcast Television) and quoted in The Thresher (Rice newspaper).
But better than that, Fox local news cameras and ABC local news and a
couple other cameras were on scene at the meeting, while I furious
wrote notes into my Visor.</p>

<p><p>Camacho said nothing of value and spoke like a slippery eel
avoiding questions.  I was anti-impressed, yet pleased that the
situation got so much attention.</p>

<p><p>I saw the news report on Fox at 9:30pm or so.  It was mostly in
favor of the students.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>After the meeting, outside and talking to people, I saw a familiar
face.  &ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo;  I asked Mondro.  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Phillip Gayle.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah!&rdquo;  I had met him while Alexis interviewed him on KTRU
about a year ago.  Cool!!  We talked a bit and then saw each other
near Val Halla (sp), a pub-thing on campus and he bought us each a Dr
Pepper.  We talked a bit and then talked outside to some other
concerned students and a local musician who said he would leave
Houston if KTRU went off the air.  Phillip had actually said the same
thing.</p>

<p><p>Afterward, Phillip drove me to my car, which was not too far off

meeting.</p>

<pre>
At 8:00am CST on Nov. 30, student-controlled programming at KTRU 91.7fm
in Houston was abruptly brought to an end by the administration of Rice
University. This was done in response to a protest by student djs of
increased athletics broadcasting on KTRU. The incident in question was
the broadcasting of music over the second half of Nov. 28th's basketball
game.

While not all djs agree with this course of action, it is clear that
the majority believe that Rice athletics has no place on KTRU.

KTRU has been controlled and run by the students of Rice University
since its inception over 30 years ago. However, the consolidation of the
radio market has increasingly left Rice athletics with fewer broadcast
options.

Over the past few years, the student management of KTRU has grudgingly
ceded air time to Rice athletics in the hopes of reaching an acceptable
compromise. Unfortunately, in the last few months the athletics department
has proceeded to continue to push for more air time with the backing of
the Rice administration.

KTRU holds an educational license from the FCC, and the students of KTRU
take that concept very seriously, believing we have a role in the education
of the audience as well as ourselves. We play a diverse assortment of
music, focusing on underexposed genres and artists. We fail to see the
educational value of broadcasting mainstream athletic events. In addition,
the proposed increase in athletics programming is essentially being
mandated by the administration of Rice University, with little to no
regard for the traditions or opinions of KTRU.

       what happened in the station this morning


this morning i went to my 7-9 shift, excessively
tired, but dragging
myself out of bed at the ungodly hour of 6:45 because
i was excited 
like i
usually am about going to my ktru shift.  the shift
was fine for the 
first
hour.  i remember at exactly 7:57, i got on the air
and announced, this 
is
91.7 fm ktru Houston, and i'll be here for another
hour and three
minutes: how could i have known how wrong I would be. 
I was there for
exactly three more minutes because in the middle of a
miles davis 
request
the station suddenly turned to static.  i sat there
completely stumped.  
i
thought perhaps he had gone into more experimental
stuff, or maybe i 
had
broken the entire station.  I came to the conclusion
after about a 
minute
or two that i had somehow broken ktru, and i reached
to pull down the
yellow instructional book in search of what the heck
you do if you 
break
the station.  At the moment i was reaching for the
book, i see none 
other
than Hutch and Camacho both well dressed, and alert
for 8 am headed my
way.  I thought perhaps i was in huge trouble with the
university for
breaking the staion, but in the back of my mind i
knew, this was it, i 
had
heard all the things about the university taking over
the station but
somehow this was real, here live in person they were
going to 
physically
come take the station.  Mind you, i am just this kid
sitting there 
behind
the dials, staring up bewildered at them.  It somehow
must have seemed
necessary to send both of them, in case perhaps they
needed to use 
force
to remove me from the station.  When they entered they
didn't say
anything. I looked at them bewildered, wondering why
they knew the 
code,
wondering what was happening, i muttered something
about i didn't know
what i had done.  this is  when they told me that it
wasn't me, it was
them first i felt relief, then confusion, then anger. 
how could they 
do
this, this was my shift. the phone kept ringing and
ringing but i 
couldn't
answer it, they told me not to answer it, i didn't
have enough
information, mind you i was given no information
whatever.  i felt 
really
powerless at this moment.  i asked them if i could put
back the music 
and
like the kind gentlemen they are, they allowed me to
return the cds to
their proper places, before escorting me out of the
station. so many
things flew through my head.  i remember saying that i
didnt' really 
know
what was going on with the whole administration, ktru
thing, that i was 
so
confused, hutch said something to the effect of "i
know, you just want 
to
play music".

 and i did but i couldn't

so sadly i left ktru not knowing the implications, the
gravity of the
situation, so that's what happened from inside the
walls of ktru at 8 
am
this morning

<p class=date>7:27am CST Thursday 30 November 2000</p>

<p><p>Work has been busy; I&rsquo;m in the process of allowing the Ritz project
to handle muliple languages.  This is due tomorrow (Friday) at
noon-ish.  I know I can finish it on time, but I&rsquo;m not sure if I can
finish it on time in the most perfect and awesome way.  I&rsquo;ll work a
lot on it today.</p>

<p><p>Wende and I have just today purchased tickets for our trip to
Australia in February.  I&rsquo;m not sure of the exact dates, but it&rsquo;s
basically 12-20 February.  Not super long, but enough to see Irene and
Nick&rsquo;s wedding.  We hope also that we can have Bryn come see us during
that time.  We&rsquo;ve decided not to try to fly to Brisbane and see her;
it&rsquo;s less expensive to have her come see us.  Plus, Bryn has more time
down under than we do.</p>

<p><p>I have just decided to apply for the winter semester at KTRU.  I
almost chose not to because of all the bickering between KTRU and the
administration.  But I decided that would be running away from the
situation, and it might make it less likely for me to be able to come
back and DJ later.  The winter schedule runs from 9 December to 26
January or so.</p>
