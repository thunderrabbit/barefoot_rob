hey rob
been following your adventures since you left for japan.  i totally
feel you with the being stuck in your room.  italy would make the 8th
country ive lived in and i cant even count how many countries ive
visited.  so here is what i know about myself when im living or
visiting a foreign country, and i thought id tell you, cause maybe
itll help.  when i first get there, i can walk around town, looking at
stuff, and its all lovely and wonderful and everything is beautiful
and new.  then, a bit later, days, weeks, i realize that im not
looking at a big painting, but that i actually have to interact with
this scene.  so then i realize i dont speak the language.  then im
like HOLY SHIT ON A STICK I CANT COMMUNICATE!  and i freak out.  and i
get stuck in my room.  and i make excuses, like, im too tired, or im
feeling sick, or the weather is bad outside.  and then i find the
easiest way to live possible.  i go to the shops where i dont have to
talk to anyone.  i try not talking to too many people.  and then
months later, i kick myself for being so silly.  getting out there is
hard, even in your home town.  getting out there in a foreign country
where you dont know the language is intensely scarey and so
frusterating at times.  dont feel bad that you afraid, but dont let it
get the best of you.  dont be hard on yourself when you fuck up, cause
youll do it alot, and if you get mad at yourself everytime, then you
are just going to be mad at yourself all the time.  for me, it feels
like im running into brick wall after brick wall after brick wall
sometimes when im in a new country, but i just have to take a breath
and forgive myself.  and then i can be really proud of small
accompishments.  you have no idea how happy i was when i finished my
first load of laundry at the laundry mat in Italy, or when i
distinguished between the women and mens bathroom in Indonesia for the
first time.  
so i guess this email of unsolicited advice will end in this: get out
there and fuck up.  fuck up bad.  you will always learn more from
getting yourself out of messes than you will buying your dinner at the
same place every night cause its easy.  and dont worry.  you can do
this, it just takes work and tears and courage.
love
annie

<p>I attended my first Japanese class today with two women instructors
and six students, all women.  Sitting across from me was Olivia and
Karly.  Karly looks like the Swiss Miss girl - attractive face, blonde
hair and a long braid on both sides.</p>

<p>She was wearing a blue sweater that kinda showed cleavage and I was
briefly distracted each time I looked over at her while she was
talking.  It mostly did not affect my Japanese intake, but I
definitely noticed.</p>

<p>I walked back to the train station with her even though it would
have been faster for me to just walk to my house, which is where I
needed to go to get my wallet, which I <em>forgot</em> when I left the
apartment today.  Took the train to my station and then walked back to
my apartment.</p>

<p>Here's a map:</p>

<pre>
S ----- O ====== A ====== T ------ W


(not to scale)
</pre>

<p>We walked from S to O (school to Okuraiyama (the local train
station)) and took the train to T (Tsunashima (my local station)) and
she continued on to W (wherever) and I walked back to A (my
apartment).</p>

<p>I looked for things to toss her off my list, but didn't find
anything blatant.  She's probably too young (early 20s) though.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>During class, we learned shit like Ohaiyogozaimas ("howdy") and
Watashi wa Rob des ("my name is (what?) slim shady") and plenty of
other stuff that I won't benefit by writing in romanji.  I benefitted
from knowing hiragana, and from having practiced a bit of katakana,
but they ended up writing most things in romanji anyway, which some of
the girls read instead of the hiragana, whcih (I think) made them
sound more fluent than I sounded.  Not that I'm fluent, which I'm
not.. Yet.</p>

<p>I'm going to review some.  I look forward to having a way to
actually write hiragana in here instead of spelling the shit out in
romanji.</p>

<p>I definitely need some index cards to make some flashcards.</p>

<br>ok  here&rsquo;s how i handle this instead of feeling insecure and jealous.  i says to mineself,i says, &ldquo;self, you&rsquo;ve just been bested!!Holy Crap!!&rdquo;  no wait, that&rsquo;s not what i say.  i say &ldquo; hey! hey you! self! take a load off!  there will <em>always</em> be girls and women, who are prettier, sexier, funnier, more accomplished or more attractive than me.  but it&rsquo;s the combination of who i am, what i have, that makes me beautiful and worthy.  whether or not rob agrees does not change that. whether or not rob  forsakes me for what might be, is up to him.  there&rsquo;s nothing i can do about that. so just chill, bitch!&rdquo;  which makes me laugh, cuz i think i&rsquo;m soo funny, and it&rsquo;s funny when i call myself bitch.<br></p>

<p><em>Killing Me Softly</em> is a ridiculous movie.</p>

<p>Here's the bottom line: don't marry someone that you've known for 2
days.  Don't break up a relationship for someone who you've known for
an hour.</p>

<p>This character Alice is a ridiculous woman.  Who the fuck would do
what she's doing in this movie?  (Why am I continuing to watch the
movie?)</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Andrew and I are watching it; the movie is probably half over.
This character Adam is damn creeeepy.</p>

<p class=date>7:01pm</p>

<p>Summary: Andrew is fired from choosing movies.</p>

<p>D'oh!</p>

<p>Still no phone.  I went back to the store where I imagine I lost
it, but they hadn't seen it.  They suggested I go to the police.</p>

<p>The police!</p>

<p>What an amazing society where the police actually have time to be
concerned over a phone..  In Houston cops can't even keep up with the
number of cars that are stolen each day, much less lost phones!</p>

<p>So I told the police at the local police box I had lost my phone.
They took my information, including the phone number (thank goodness I
had memorized it!!!!) and my address (thank goodness I have it on my
computer cause I have not memorized it!!) and where I work.  I don't
have that number memorized, but thank goodness for phone books so they
can look it up!</p>

<p>Best part was how he told me something that would happen next.  He
was all, "yamma yamma yammera" and I'm like "Erh?" so he drew a
picture.</p>

</pre>

<p>Aright.</p>

<p>I borrowed his pen and wrote "We will send you a letter." thereby
putting my teaching skills to work in real life.</p>

<p>I'm going to stop by Gera Gera to email Janette and Wende that I'm
phoneless for now.</p>

<p>Got home from work and my phone was magically on my desk on top of
a postcard from Janette!</p>

<p>I plan to get a longer string/handle thing for my phone, maybe a
retractable one that keeps it attached to me.  That might be a bit
obnoxious or look stupid, but I'm certainly thankful to have my phone
back.</p>

<p>Life is beautiful.</p>

<p>And I have the next two days off work.  Nice.</p>

the end.</p>

pissed off side.  We talked a bit about old times and how's the family
and stuff like that.  He asked how my mom was doing and she showed up
in the dream and tickled him a bit like she always did with us
(*).</p>

<p class=dream>I talked to Em a bit like, "man I bet you've been busy
as fuck with all this concert shit going on and all that."</p>

<p class=dream>He was like yeah and stuff and asked how things were
going for me.  I thought it was cool that he remembered my name,
etc.</p>

<p>(*) actually I don't remember her ever tickling me.</p>

<p>I just watched all but the dumb parts of <em>8 Mile</em>.
Nice.</p>

<p>In the micro-interview of Eminem, he says some shit that inspires
me to do what I need to do.  I'm thankful for that.</p>

<p>Am I a mammal?  Today I've just been attached to my bed.  Each time
I try to get up I'm like brrrrr it's tooo cold.  Even though it's not
really *that* cold.  Like giant bed magnets keep me stuck.</p>

<p>My fingers are almost too paralyzed to write.  My brain goes
flitting about in different directions wondering about this and
thinking about that, all under the guise of optimizing my experience
here in Japan, but ultimately resulting in further hibernation.</p>

<p>Okay I'm *really* going to study some Japanese now.</p>

<p class=date>9:55am</p>

<p>I studied the katakana: A, I, U, E, O, Ka, Ki, Ku, Ke, & Ko.  I can
now write and identify each of these.</p>

<p>Plus I took a shower and started my laundry.</p>

<p>The Nova office in Tsunashima is SO relaxed compared to Kawasaki!
They've got maybe four lessons max going on at once instead of at
least four plus kids classes in Kawasaki.  Man this is fantastic and I
love covering for people here!</p>

<p>Because it's so relaxed, and in my area, I have learned where my
local bank is located so I can begin the process of discerning my
financial situation.</p>

<p>My English is definitely being affected by teaching.</p>
