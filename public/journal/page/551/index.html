<p class=note>(dream)</p></p>

<p class=dream>Traveling, at an airport or something with a weird
escalator with independently lifting steps.  Each step went up and
down, and the individual could get up without actually stepping up,
but instead just by moving forward.  I got my bag before anyone else
did, and left the room.</p>

<p class=dream>When I came back, no one was in the room, but the weird
chair up and down thing was still working.  I lay down on it and
actually fell down into the mechanism, which was a huge empty room,
with the portal at the top opening and closing.  I didn't fall, but
grasped with my fingertips the edge of the step.  I recognized that I
was safe (in a dream I can't be hurt), but I didn't seem to recognize
I was in a dream.</p>

<p>I'm falling asleep as I write this.  Trying to think of words that
do not contain 'e' at any location.  I must say that writing without
using 'e' is tricky.  You should try it.</p>

<p>As of yesterday, Wende and I lost our internet
connection at home.  This is a result of Northpoint
going out of business.  They were providing our DSL
service.  Doh!!</p>

<p>So I can only add entries from work for a few days
until we get a cable modem installed.  It will take
about a week for that apparently as we don't have
cable at our house now.</p>

<p>Wende was all, "we will have <em>cable</em>???"</p>

<p>Yup.  It's a package deal.</p>

<p>Ironically, we were just talking about the
possibility of us losing access at home because of
Northpoint's bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Today I updated some data (there were errors in it
when the users gave it to us) and am just about to
revamp the way some of the questions are displayed. 
I'll give them greater functionality.</p>

<p>And today I fucked up my "magnetic" security card
thing.  I had it on my keyring, and the end ripped
off.  So I cut a hole out in the middle of the card,
not cutting any of the wires, and now it doesn't work.
 I'm 99% certain I didn't cut any of the wires (it's
actually 1 really long wire in a coiled loop), but I
definitely bent them in a couple places.  Maybe the
bend did it?  I'll read about them online to see if
that will tell me how to fix it.</p>

<p>brb</p>

<p class=date>6:54pm</p>

<p>Okay.  I found <a
href="https://www.hidcorp.com/">www.hidcorp.com</a>,
and I called them.  They said that a slight bend in
the wires could cause it to not function.</p>

<p>I took the card outside by the reader and I got it
to beep once.  Really.  It beeped but I wasn't able to
get it to beep again.  Maybe I will find a different
way to "break" into the building.  On the inside of
the outer door, there's a motion detector, and the
door doesn't close with a super sealed vacuum, but
just with a strong magnet.  Maybe I can slide a piece
of cardboard through the slot and wave it at the
motion detector to get in.  That's worth a shot.</p>

<p>But not right now.  I'm going to review a CD for
KTRU before I leave.</p>

<p>- - -</p>

<p>Actually I did just go downstairs to try it out.  I
sat down just inside the door to see how much wiggling
it would take to open the door.  It seems to take
pretty much a lot of wiggling.  More than just
wiggling my hand near the bottom of the door.  I
wonder if it takes a small wiggle near the top of the
door...</p>

<p class=date>7:07pm</p>

<p>Oh yes, baby!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>From outside, I stuck a piece of cardboard inside
near the top of the door and it opened right up. 
Beautiful!!!</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p></p>

<p class=dream>After hours at my old high school in the teachers
lounge, present day.  We were looking through old stuff and came
across a weird collection of writings.  Apparently, the teachers'
aides, having nothing better to do, were asked to write their comments
about the teachers for whom they were aides.</p>

<p class=dream>All these comments were compiled in a booklet per
teacher, and then all the booklets in one folder.  We found booklets
for Mrs Sherman, Mrs Roberts, Lucy Lu, and many others.  Mrs Sherman
was my Spanish teacher, and Mrs Roberts (in my dream) was my typing
teacher.</p>

<p class=dream>The funniest thing about these (besides that they
existed at all) was they were all written neatly in pencil, and the
teachers graded the work.</p>

<p class=dream>We decided to contact Mrs Roberts, who was no longer at
the school, to get some followup information about some bit of gossip
we gleaned from her booklet.  Kathryn (who I went to Costa Rica with
in 1998) and I were going to call her as if legitimately wondering
about her and then work the gossip query into the conversation.</p>

<p class=dream>The room we were in was all full of people in a meeting,
so we couldn't call her from this room.  Just as we were leaving, a
girl asked if she could see the booklet of her old teacher, Lucy Lu.
I found the booklet and gave it to her.  Kathryn and I left the room
and I went out toward the pool.  I was only wearing swimming trunks so
I jumped in.  Kathryn was wearing an all red outfit, including red
pants, blazer, baseball cap.  She jumped in anyway.</p>

<p class=dream>A few other people jumped in too, including Elizabeth
(YRUU from San An).  We decided to play a quick game of water
basketball before we called.  I was on Kathryn's team, Elizabeth and
the other two people who came were the other team.  Just as we started
to play, I woke up.</p>

<p>Today I logged like 9 or 11 hours at work.  I think
11.  Anyway, I implemented a cool new thing with the
G3 project.  Now we can specify on a per-survey basis
whether the user gets confirmation of who they logged
in as.</p>

<p>This is cool because some users were complaining
that there are too many "intro" pages on the site.  I
would definitely agree; I was young when I wrote that
part of the site.</p>
