<p>I just spent an hour painting on my canvas.  I just put everything
on my kitchen floor, for relatively easy cleanup, and an added bonus
of Spot walking across the paint and onto the canvas, leaving a couple
of footprints for me.  Such a helpful cat!  :-)</p>

<p>I found a fundamental difference between painting on plates versus
painting on canvas, which actually is the difference between
watercolor and acrylics:  With watercolor, I have to paint the
background last (with an itty bitty brush, between the foreground
paint), and with acrylics, I should paint the background first, cause
the foreground of any color will go right on top of it.</p>

<p>I painted significantly more in this hour than in my first hour of
painting on the canvas.  And I used the darker pigments this time,
instead of just the yellow red blue green.</p>

<p class=date>1:20pm CST Sunday 16 December 2001</p></p>

<p>The most amazing splendid synchronous thing in the world just
happened to me.  I chose not to stop by the Shell station to grab a
sandwich on the way to YRUU because I thought there may be food
available at the church.</p>

<p>There was none.  Except some cookies from last week.</p>

<p>I chose not to drive my car back to the Shell station because that
would be silly; it's a short walk through the woods.</p>

<p>On the way walking, I saw the man on bicycle that Amy, Susie and I
thought was a man wearing a gorilla mask that day when I tried to roll
the window down and yell cheerfully, "what's up gorilla!!!" and was
all, "oh shit!" when I saw he was a man <em>not</em> wearing a mask,
and oh gosh how horribly embarrassing that would have been.</p>

<p>So I saw him again, in real life.  Amazingly, he was facing away
from me, so it was <em>exactly</em> the same view - a guy with black
straight hair, wearing a suit, riding a bike.  Pretty distinguishable
compared to everyone else in the area.</p>

<p>Wow.  So I walked up and wished him good morning and met him and
everything.  His name is Lonnie (sp), and he used to work at the
school at which he had been gazing and reminiscing.  Nice.</p>

<p>So thankful to have the karmic burden lifted from my mind.</p>

<p>Left work today while it was still light and rode backwards down
the new-ish-ly poured feeder road beside our building.
Archaeologically observed the concrete cylinders standing like soldiers
guarding the freeway canyon from an onslaught of dirt.  I know that a
huge post hole digger dug tubes in the dirt back when it was still a
sloped embankment to the highway.  Then concrete was poured and the
dirt on the highway side was removed, leaving a wall of concrete
cylinders, reminding me of a wall made of tree logs surrounding an old
timey fort.</p>

<p>Most of the cylinders are quite rough, as might be expected having
been poured into a dirt mold.  Yet some are particularly smooth as if
the dirt had been lined with a smooth tube into which the concrete was
poured.  Very curious.</p>

<p>I reached the end of the new concrete highway, watched the cars
come hurtling toward me and safely past on the other side of the guard
wall (not the above mentioned wall).</p>

<p>I wondered if any cops would care that I was there.</p>

<p>Rode back and watched the cylinders more carefully.  The smooth
ones also had rebar sticking out their tops.  And they were labeled
"light."  I looked across the highway and saw a light directly across.
Aha!  These received special treatment because they'll be holding the
extra weight of the lights!</p>

<p>I noticed other markings, which were less apparently useful, and
some for which I have hypothesis.  <em>maybe</em> I'll take pictures
of it.  I sure seem to say that a lot.  A digital camera is coming
soon into my life.  I can just feel it.</p>

<p>Tonight, Dude and I are meeting Maggie and Maggie Moo's ice cream
place for ice cream!</p>

<p>First, a quick entry about why linux rules. (and unix, probably)</p>

<p>We had a power failure today at work.  I'm thankful that my
workstation is on a UPS and I didn't lose any information.  My linux
box, however, is not on UPS and it lost power.</p>

<p>When I turned it on, I expected it to check the drives after they
had been crudely dismounted.  Nope.  They were not checked.  You know
why?  Because my machine was not in use, so after several minutes it
flushes all the drive buffers and turns off the drives.  So they were
all apprently flushed and off when the power was cut.  Awesome.</p>

<p>linux rules.</p>

<p>My work rules, too.</p>

<p>Not that I'm Mr Thrilled to be doing the work that I'm doing, but
just yesterday I wrote an email to Kevin and Karla indicating that my
emotions are pushing me away from work.  "Not my emotions so much, but
my spirit is pulling me away," I said.</p>

<p>They are being incredibly supportive.  Moreso than I ever could
have imagined.  I'm inspired to help make this a smooth transition to
get me out of here.</p>

<p>Part of that transition is for me to have something to go
<em>to</em>.  My personal coach Kim is helping with that.  I told him
this morning about last night's email and he suggested that now would
therefore be a good time to begin building my new life.</p>

<p>True.</p>

<p>I dropped off my check request form to KTRU and corrected an
operator log entry that I had forgotten and zipped out of there
thinking I had to rush to my 7pm leisure learning class called
something like, "how to eat without eating a lot of sugars and flours"
or some such.  It meets at Whole Foods on Bellaire.</p>

<p>Anyway, I zipped out of KTRU and checked my phone/watch.  Ah.  I
still have a full hour.  I realized after I left the campus that I
could have cruised back up to the station and hung out with Dan and
Chad, but apparently chose not to.  I wonder if I would have if they
were cute girls?</p>

<p>Maybe.  Probably.  Who knows?</p>

<p>So I'm asked to modify a report so that instead of 1/5th of it
being updated 5 times a week, the thing is created in realtime each
time it's run.  Barf.</p>

<p>Erika is here.  I love to flirt with her and it makes it hard for
me to work sometimes.  I don't know how long she'll be in town, but
hopefully for a while.  I'll be more focused in the middle of her
stay, but not as much at the beginning nor end.</p>

<p class=date>5:41pm</p>

<p>I just wrote a frustrated-with-job email to Kevin and Karla.  I was
able to get mostly good stuff done today.</p>

<p>Now I'm going to I-group.  </p>

<pre>
Hello lovely friends, the times have changed since the
last time I wrote on September 11th when my brains
were freshly scrambled.  It took a while to process my
revived disgust with our world situation.  Now that my
thoughts have a fresh order I have decided that an
absurd explanation for all of this is the one I can
live with for now.  At the onset of the reactions that
followed 9-11 my punk rocker reaction was outrage at
the superpowers that toy with humanity and
economically dictate our lives.  Whoever they are, I
was sure they somehow were privy to the why's and
how's behind many of  the "terrorist" activities of
our period and the authors of the new wave of
"control" we are moving into. While we conquer our
children, the indigenous left on the earth, the
animals, our planet and each other into submission due
to fear-our petroleum-arms based economy uses war and
mass suffering to gauge stock market values.  War is a
waste of time and resources.  Overpopulation, over
industrialization, exploitation of the earth and the
oceans and her resources and disregard for the oxygen
producing systems we depend on will leave us in a big
mess not so long from now and we still shy away from
that grim reality cause we are so comfortable.  I have
tried to fit all my theories together to make a
certain sense of it all.  I am a person who once said
i believe in everything, which is very close to
nothing.  I accept the fact that everything is
relative and that it would be quite difficult to know
the absolute truth of our universal nature.  My simple
rationalization for our mis-management of this planet
is that we are not from this planet, so like tourists
in Spain, we throw our trash down wherever we want. 
Here it is, we began as a genetic experiment between a
extra terrestrial race of people and an earth species
like homo erectus.  Maybe they had recently
overpopulated and industrialized their planet and
needed more resources and workers to harvest them, and
after some rough years in the lab-walla, here we are
in our 10 toed glory!  We do have the nicest planet in
the galaxy. This explains Atlantis, Lemuria, the
astronomical maps of Teotehuacan and Egypt, the greek
and roman gods, strip mining and clear cutting, the
banana, the space program and who nets the profits
from the Gross World Production.  Someones got to get
off this planet alive and find the next paradise
planed to harvest.  So that is my theory in a
nutshell, i am probably not the first to arrive at
such a conclusion.  Perfectly absurd and plausable.
Anyway, Christian, or Muslem, from the Orion Nebula or
the Solar System,  it is one universal force that
binds us and there is no excuse to trash our planet or
any other.  
        Language is such a crazy tool to play with. 
It is almost impossible to communicate exactly the way
we feel without changing the feeling.  Even if there
was only one language, would people understand each
other?  There are so many important feelings and
desires that all humans share and the language that
would inhance our understanding about this is not used
if it exists at all.  We say things in bursts of
conceited manipulation that we don't even understand
and because it sounds right we defend it. I don't
think I am ready to defend my alien theory, but it
makes me laugh to think I can take myself seriously.  
 
     I walked a long way this summer, from the North
of France, near to where D-Day occurred in Normandy,
to the south.  While rescuing a dog from what was soon
to be his certain death, I took my first spill of the
pilgrimage and hurt my leg.  After a brief hospital
visit and x-ray to determine it wasn't broken, I
hitchhiked the last 50 miles to Ariege, where I am
staying for the winter.  A good friend has lent me her
house in the mountains.
      From my back yard I can see the white peaks that
define the border between France and Spain.  The view
would be a marvelous hallucination if it were not
real.  The house is about 3/4 of the way up the
mountain (and way off the road) at about 4000 feet in
elevation.  The spring is not far away and the water
is like candy.  My friend from Holland came to visit
and he says the house looks like Pippi Longstocking's
house.  The mountain is very steep.  The garden has
the biggest sage plants I have ever seen and there
were apples on the trees when I got there.  There was
no firewood and the deal I have always had with myself
about staying here is that I would cut no trees for
firewood.  I built an A-frame sled and I hike to the
top of the mountain and find dead trees, cut them into
4 to 6 foot sections, tie them to the sled and run
down the mountain pulling the load.  I have a handsaw
and a little axe.  There are huge chestnut trees and 
hot roasted chestnuts are delicious.
      My friend has 4 kids, so the house is big, too
big to heat.  I am isolating the living room and have
moved the woodburning stove next to the fireplace
where I keep an open fire to cook on and look at. It
is a science to stay warm up there.   The views out of
the enormous windows are enough to get me out of bed
in the morning. Last week there was fog in the valley
on several mornings and to see the snowy mountains
opposite mine above the clouds was like seeing them
for the first time. I could not gaze enough at the
breathing mist bathing the valley floor and the
mountain sides. Almost everytime I look around it is
still as stunning as the first time. There is a bath
house that looks like the gable of a castle, and a big
porcelain tub with a matching wood-burning water
heater. The last time I was here I had to walk down to
the river to bathe. On November 8th it started to
snow. We had about 1.5 feet of snow (50-60 cm)! and
there is still snow on the ground. I have neighbors
400 meters away with kids my age (6 and 10). We play
in the forest and sled in the powder snow and take
long walks and have long discussions in French. They
invited me for Christmas, and would look after me if I
needed it. I have not gotten bored or lonely and the
hard work and solitude feel good. I have a fair amount
of wood and am becoming a little more resilant in the
snow and cold. Hopefully it won't be too much for this
Texas girl to tough it out for the winter. I still
have a long walk towards Portugal in the Spring.  I
bought lots of warm clothes and have had excellent
luck finding beautiful and warm 2nd hand blankets. I
plan to come down possibly two times a month. I have 8
kilos of bio oatmeal and a chest full of provisions.
There is a solar panel and if I wanted to bring a
battery up, I would have electricity. I put up a radio
antenna and while the sun is shining, I have good
reception with the little car stereo in the house. At
night candle light is enough, and the ambiance is rich
and sometimes smokey. So that is the setting for this
part of my journey. My work has been thinking about
how I feel about love, children (having them), giving,
taking care of myself, settling into an idea of who I
am and what I want to be and trying to find a language
for that, accepting my choice to take an alternate
road in life and trying to make sense of the route I
have traveled thus far, and opening up to breathing
and the moment. Thank you for your patience with this
letter. For lack of not having anything good to say
about the barbarian bloodbath ritual we so easily
responded to the painful events of 9-11 with, I didn't
have much to say. I hope this is just a growing pain
in our accelleration evolution. With the best aim I
can hold I am shooting on a spiritual trajectory of
self discovery and acceptance. I know all of this is
part of the plan, and I too have a part to play. I
hope you are at peace with yourself, your family is
healthy and staying warm, the sun is shining from
within and you trust your footsteps. Thank you for
your companionship in spirit, I feel you and don't get
lonely with you as company in my heart. Have a very
prosperous end of the year and happy holidays.
 Be good and excercise your freedoms. Love, gin

<p>I'm at KTRU now, waiting for the basketball sports
announcer guys to connect us to the game.  The game
hasn't started yet - about 30 minutes, so we still
have some time.  I called them a bit ago and he said
it was all good.</p>

<p>I got the 7-10pm Saturday shift with Donna again,
even though I'm lax in reviewing CDs.  I checked out
three CDs tonight and I intend to listen to them
during the basketball game, beginning the review
asap.</p>

<p class=date>6:43pm</p>

<p>They are connected.  I'm quite thankful to have
that connection done so easily as opposed to last
time!</p>

<p class=date>6:57pm</p>

<p>I just wrote the entry about the lock-in and the DJ
before me asked if I was ready to go with the game. 
"Um, sure!" and I walked into the control room and
noted we were broadcasting dead air.  As I grabbed a
CD at random from the stacks and cued it up, I asked
him, "did you announce your last song?" so I would
know where to start.  He had.</p>

<p>"KTRU Houston, we are now going to play a little
bit of music before the basketball game begins in
about 10 minutes, thank you for your patience.  What
I've got cued up for you is _____ (whatever)___ by
___(whomever)____."</p>

<p>Please note that as I was speaking "What I've got
cued up for you," I was grabbing the CD case to see
what in fact I had cued up.  I had no idea.  I love
running the radio station on the edge of chaos and
fucking up.  It gets my adrenaline swirling happily
through me.</p>

<p>Just got a call from Amanda at Atheletics, about 3
minutes until 3 minute countdown.  About 2 minutes now
I'm sure.</p>

<p>This is probably my last entry until after my
shift.</p>

<p class=date>next day</p>

<p>Game was longer than I expected; I only got 30
minutes of music playing time from 9:30 to 10.  Still
fun stuff.</p>

<p>So last night was our HAC YAC rally planning
lock-in.  How incredibly amazing for me to watch the
youth running the meetings and pretty much having
everything under control.  When I was the adult host
of Houston rally in 1996 / 1997, I was running the
meetings and showing the youth what it took to run a
rally.   Since then I remember just being vaguely
involved one year, just offering the main components
and letting them hash out the details.  Last night....
I slept through the meeting.  Now <em>That's</em>
youth empowerment!</p>

<p>Yes, there were other adults there to offer help if
needed, and in some cases (fucking loudmouth Evelyn)
unneeded help.  But I basically kept my trap shut
except for one time when I mouthed, "just shut the
fuck up" and went back to sleep.  Someone (Erica?)
commented that I mouthed something up at the ceiling
when I was sleeping, and I was all, "oh yeah, I was,
um, not very impressed with someone at the meeting,"
and she was all, "oh yeah, I know who you're talking
about."</p>

<p>Not necessarily the epitome of excellent lead by
example, but whatever.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>After the meeting I was pretty much awake and we
played a few rounds of Sardines (Amy had a great
hiding spot and used Graham as a decoy, but I should
have been able to tell by his pants.), and then Mafia 
(Phat Pat as god and then Erica as god) and True
Colors and then a couple rounds of Truth or Dare (I
stuck my hand in the ceiling fan), and then most
people were falling asleep except for Jaime, David and
Pat, so I told a few of my long jokes:  Pink Elephant,
Moe and Joe, Kid who loved to do dishes, and the joke
about the snail.</p>

<p>Wonderful fun for the whole group.</p>

<p>Slept about .5 hour until it was time to wake up
and we cleaned up and I went back to sleep in the YRUU
room.  I found myself alone there when I woke up at
10:30am this morning.  Susie had left me a note,
though.</p>

<p>I love my Youth!</p>
