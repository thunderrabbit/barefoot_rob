<p>Feel sad.  too soggy to talk to janette.  just want to sleep it all
away.  depressed it seems.  surfing Amazon dot com, reading old
emails, sluggishly not studying Japanese.</p>

<p>I woke up all grr this morning cause I have to go to work.</p>

<p>Grrr.</p>

<p>But I have successfully caught a train just in time this morning,
and there's a seat for me to write, so that's better.</p>

<p>If I'm on my bike on the bridge as the train goes by on its bridge,
then if I haul butt, I can make the *next* train, which is what I did
today.  Only thing is, from the bridge, I cannot distinguish which
trains will stop at my station, and if the "next" train is an Limited
Express train, then it won't stop at my station.</p>

<p>I'm a tiny bit sweaty; I hope I don't stink too much.</p>

<p>I showered this morning but I didn't shave, as my personal little
way to break the rules.  Oooh.  What a rebel.</p>

<p>I feel much better after talking to janette for nearly 2 hours.
First 20 minutes converted me from sad sad sleeping it all away mood
to genki enough to get up and call her from the freephone.</p>

<p>Talked a ton and I cried a lot about how hard it is to learn
Japanese and how I'm afraid I won't be able to do it, and I don't want
to come back and not have learned Japanese cause I would call that
failure and I don't know why I seem to have chosen a life without
physical connections with anyone, etc etc cry cry cry.</p>

<p>But then I felt better enough to read my Japanese sentences to her,
including these:</p>

<p>火曜に三島で僕のとまだちのりえさんと会いました。</p>

<p>じでんしゃで綱島からきくなまで行きました。</p>

<p>でんsひゃできくなからしんよこはままで行きました。</p>

accepting the risk of sounding too placating, i think you are doing beautifully, probably alot better than you realize.  you are staying steady on,allowing for occassional blocks.  you have not used old escape routes. it's ok to ride through soggy times and not be constantly achieving. you are strong enough to feel your pain and not buckle under and give up. i hope you will be as sweet to yourself as i would. i think you are learning alot more than japanese.

<p>No awesome students nor classes today at work.  The schedule was
crammed because Jon M tupatsued (I don't think this is a Japanese
term, but we use it at Nova to mean called in sick (or hungover)) and
then it got even worse cause Benny tupatsued as well.  I had two
minutes to pull files and plan a lesson for 3 people, but it turned
out okay because Carla had already pulled the files since she knew the
lesson had to be covered.  She had even selected a lesson that they
could do.</p>

<p>Some of the worst language structure came from my two level 3
students.  These fuckers should be able to speak quite accurately, but
they could most certainly <em>not</em>.</p>

<p>Three things:</p>

<p>(zero) Agreed with Jon L to give a level four student level up to
level three.  She was quite happy and passed the test rather well.
The level 3 test is rather difficult, according to Steve.</p>

<p>(ichi) Had a great 7C student to close out the day.  Her name is
Kazue, and she's a computer engineer of some variety.  Part of the
reason I liked her is she remindes me of someone else, but I can't
remember who.  She was quite yammerful, not like a normal 7C, all meek
and waiting for prompts before speaking.</p>

<p>(ni) Talked with Karen, my dad's wife about 20 minutes.  I talked
to her longer than I've talked to her ever before.  I'm not sure what
that means, but it's probably a combination of missing home and not
having experienced her anger anytime recently.</p>

<p>(san) Talked a long time with janette.  All was cool until I came
out with not really wanting to know her past because some of the parts
I know sorta creep me out like she has smoked and I'm like eeee gross
and her reaction, understandably, was "hey man that's all part of me"
and she was careful to not get defensive, but it did make her a little
sad.  Sigh.</p>

<p>(shi) At the very end as we were hanging up, she goes, "I hope that
your experience there will help you know what types of things you want
to have close to you in your life," and I was just CONKED in the
emotional head with it like BAM *sadness*.  But I didn't want to
extend the conversation longer; it's 1am and I've got to be at work in
8.5 hours.</p>

<p>(5) I did 1 - 4 above instead of studying Japanese.  I trust it's
all for the best, but sometimes it's hard to see what's best.   and
sometimes I realize there is no best; there just is what is.</p>

<p>I had a man to man lesson with Satoko today.  She and I have been
emailing each other occassionally for a couple weeks.  We haven't
talked about hanging out outside of Nova, but it will probably happen.
I'm being super careful because I've got janette, and because chillin'
with students is officially disallowed.</p>

<p>She told me about a tour she took around Tokyo area, including
Tokyo Tower and Asakusa and the Imperial Palace and other Japanese
names that I don't remember.</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>I feel blessed and loved.  I got an email from Ben, asking for my
recommendation on a new possible move in Silent Football (ironic since
Fred and I were recently discussing how neither he nor I could just
arbitrarily make new rules).. Basically defining how/if an outward
facing person can Fwap the ball.</p>

<p>And Maggie wrote me a super long email transcribing some of my
old-school journal entries (<a
href="https://www.robnugen.com/cgi-local/journal.pl?date=1993/03/20">20
March 1993</a>) and has expressed that she really misses me as
well.</p>

<p>Sigh.  So much love.  Thank you, thank you.  I miss you guys so
much.</p>

<p>I like the way Frank writes little stories.  Not even stories, but
just little snippets of funny bits.  I might do that; I have many

<p>I did so much yesterday and wrote nothing.</p>

<p>Saw T3 with Cors and a Japanese cat named Ken.  Movie exceeded my
expectations of a Part III.  When I saw T2, my expectations were HUGE
cause of the hype, and I was not impressed.  My experience this time
was better.  Plus I didn't predict the ending.  Though I think I heard
something interesting in the dialogue: At one point a character gives
directions to a place and says "bearing point zero five degrees" but
later another character incorrectly repeats the information as "point
one five degrees."</p>

<p>Here's something funny: I wrote that all generically as to not give
away the plot so I won't piss off any of my readers, who I imagine are
all in the US, but now I realize if you haven't seen the movie by now,
you ain't gonna care.  T3 just came out in Japan.</p>

<p>Went out with Andrew and Ben to Ginza to an expensive excellent
buffet called Farm Grill.  3800 yen for ice cream, cakes, drinks,
sliced fruits, mashed potatoes, veggie casseroles, shrimp, sushi, crab
legs, roasted chicken halves, roasted beef.</p>

<p>We were stuffed by the end of the night.  They moreso than I.  "A
place like this is just wasted on you, man," said Ben as we started
our first plates.  Theirs were based on beef and seafood.  Mine was
veggie casserole and some other sloppy yummy foods.  I had 3 plates
and 3 glasses of OJ.  They had 4 plates, alcohol (Randy, the tall dark
& handsome bartender from Chicago, made a Bunker Buster for Andrew:
Tequila, vodka, rum, and gin), and lots of pain.</p>

<p>Take the Ginza line to Ginza and leave the station through exit 4.
Find a clock on top of a building diagonally left across the street
and a Nova straight across the street.  Turn 180 degress around and
walk directly away from Nova (and the clock).  Go about 5 blocks and
turn left just before you go under an overpass.  (There will be a toy
store on the right.)  Go about one block and find farm grill signage.
It's up on the second floor.</p>
