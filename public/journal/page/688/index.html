<p class=date>9:45AM Sunday Sept 6 1992</p>

<p>I just had a dream</p>

<p class=dream>I was being rolled backwards lying down through a
building at school by my school friends.  At one point, I saw a woman
named Lauren from Northwoods church, and she had braces.  I told them,
"stop." so they did and I got up and talked to her some and hugged her
and gave her a bite on her neck.  I kissed her a tiny bit on the lips
and I felt her braces with my tongue.</p>

<p class=dream>Then I whispered, "come here" to her ear.  She came
closer and I said, "I've got a braces fetish"  so she kissed me again
and I licked her braces and nibbled on them and loved it.  I was
totally getting a hardon in my dream(?) and was about to orgasm, so I
quit kissing her so I wouldn't cum everywhere in my dream.  I was like
entirely turned on in the dream.  We stopped kissing and I calmed down
a little.  It turned out that she lived in New York or somewhere far
away, was married, and pregnant.  So we exchanged addresses and such.
Then she drew a cool 3-D rendition of my apartment, except it wasn't
my apartment.</p>

<p>Really weird.  I'm going to look up Bobbie in the old UH phone book
- see what I can get.  Later</p>

<p>785-3542 It was a ans. machine with a dude's voice.  crap.</p>

<p class=date>Saturday 1:45AM 5 Sept 1992</p>

<p>"Today" after school, I tried to study for a while in the Fine Arts
Building library.  I rented TRON and we all watched it in Molly's
room.  I sat between Cindy M & Molly on Molly's bed & flirted a little
with both of them and I also flirted a little with Maggie, who sat in
front of me.  After the movie, Marcel, Molly & I went to Kroger and to
Randall's and completed Operation B.S.  B.S. = Banana Sticker.  We
collected a total of 49 banana stickers on the botton of my frisbee.
We now have 78 stickers, and we're going to put them on Greg's yellow
'banana' car.  At Midnight, I went to the OB desk and talked to Judy.
Caleb & Audrey walked up and Audrey was as smiley and flirtations as
ever.  I told her, "Come here." She smiled big as she walked up to me,
and I poked my finger in her side until she shrieked and hit the
floor.  Most entertaining.  I'm going to call Edith at 5:35AM for her
wake up call.  Later</p>

<p class=date>Friday 4 Sept 1992 12:25AM</p>

<p>"Today" I was bored in Fortran, and then went to bowling.  We
watched a dumb movie about the history of bowling.  It was cool,
though, since Maggie leaned back on my knees.  We had no digital logic
lab, so she and I went to her room and talked.  We ate pop tarts and
then I got her to lie on me face to face on her bed as we talked.  We
didn't do anything, but I did my normal pleading & requesting just a
little kiss from her.  We joke like that a lot.  I loved it.  Anyway,
we were laying on her bed with her on me and Danielle came in.  Maggie
kinda climbed off me and I thought it was hilarious.  Maggie said she
would have preferred it to be John, since she could "explain it off
him," and he would forget about it.  Danielle <em>won't</em> forget
about it, and will apparently ask Maggie about it later.</p>

<p>After artificial intelligence, I watched the Simpsons with Laura.
Then I went home, but talked to Nina, the UHPD cop, along the way.</p>

<p>Lucy Proctor came over tonight and we typed in her resume' and
printed it on the laser printer at Social Work.  I enjoyed doing that.
We kissed at the very end of the night, but nothing else.</p>

<p>I called Theresa-who-knows-Bobbie, but it was a wrong number.  I
also met an RA, Jennifer, who has some of Bobbie's stuff and will give
Bobbie a note that I wrote, indicating my 24 hour hotline phone
number.  I may also search for her tomorrow morning.  Wish me luck.
Later</p>

<p class=date>1:29 AM Thursday, 3 Sept 1992</p>

<p>"Today" I spent all afternoon on my homework blockade.  Oh -
Danielle was in Digital Logic.  She is married and happy about it.
She also has her braces removed now.  Her smile looks great.  I talked
to her for 30 minutes after class today, and we joked around about
kissing, etc.  I'm very glad to see her again.</p>

<p>Update on Bobbie with braces.  Max, the 3rd floor RA, told me her
last name.  So I went to see Judy, a friend of the clique, at the OB
desk.  She looked her up, but she wasn't in the directory.  so Judy
gave me the extension of Theresa, who knows Bobbie, and probably has
her number.  Cool.  Probability & Statistics sucks.  The book sucks.
I like Digital Logic.  Later</p>

<p>I can barely write yet.</p>

<p class=date>6:57AM Wednesday September 2nd 1992</p>

<p>Yesterday was the second day of school.  At one point, I was
walking past Bates, and a guy & girl came out.  I had seen her before
and she asked me my name.  I was surprised by the quesion because she
has braces and I didn't answer her but instead asked if they lived in
Bates.  He lives there, but she does not.  We walked and talked and as
we were about to part, she asked again for my name.  I told her.  her
name is Bobbie.  She has braces.  She has braces.  Since she asked me
her name, I stayed walking with them for as long as possible.</p>

<p>Later, I was talking to Molly, who said that I would like Bobbie.
She is very funny.  She apparently said, "I came to college and lost
my virginity.  I've lost my boyfriend, and now I've lost my sensuality
to physics."  I told Molly that I plan to study with her or something
and tell her, "I have a braces fetish.  May I kiss you?"  Molly said
she would respect that.  Molly said she has a temper, [banging on the
dorm door] "Why aren't you in there, dammit?  You don't <em>have</em>
a life!  <em>I'm it!</em></p>

<p>Molly heard through Greg that one time she was pissed at her
boyfriend and took him into her room and "fucked his brains out." Then
as she was still breathing heavy said, "Now get out of my room."  I'm
totally going to meet her.</p>

<p>Yesterday in Fortran, I realized it would be an easy class.
Instructor: "How many people have computers?"  1/2 the class raised
their hands.  I raised both hands.  He asked me, "You have 2
computers?"  "Yes."  Then he asked, "How many people have programming
experience?"  3 people raised their hands.  "What languages?"  Me:
"Pascal, Cobol, C, assembly."  He: "Why are you in this class?"  Me:
"Easy A."  Dude.  I totally have to get an A in there now.</p>

<p>Today is a HOMEWORK BLOCKADE.  Later</p>

<p class=date>8:35AM Tuesday 1 September 1992</p>

<p>The most triumphant thing has happened.  Remember how I'm totally
going to get a 4.0?  Remember my Homework Blockades that I've set up?
Molly & Maggie & Marcel & Steve all think it's a good idea and we're
all going to do it.  RIGHT!!!  That is so totally totally cool.  Molly
suggested we set up a Blockade every Sunday and Wednesday, and then
some secondary ones if necessary.  That is so totally excellent.</p>

follow as well.</p>

<p>Yesterday after school I went shopping with Maggie.  I enjoyed
spending some time with her.  We bought a new pencil for me; my 8 year
old pencil that I've had since Mr Bandecca's algebra 9th grade has
died....  I did homework and then we played nuclear war in Marcel's
room.  I goofed around with Judy & Steve at the OB desk until 1AM or
so.  I had trouble staying awake on the way home..  Later</p>

<p class=date>12:15AM Monday August 31 1992</p>

<p>"Today" I read the first chapter in each of my books.  That was my
first homework blockade.  I went to the school to hang out and I saw
C walking to his room with A, the girl who did the shrill
giggle sound file on the NeXT, and his roommate.  I went with them to
check out C's new computer.  While I played on it, C and
A were totally kissing.  I didn't pay attention too much until
they sang some lines from Rocky Horror Picture Show.  A bit later, I
noted that A was totally kissing C's roommate.  Dude.</p>

<p>So I started caressing her foot and her legs as she alternated
between them.  I worked my way up to fingering her inside her shorts
for a while, and then she started kissing me.  We kissed and kissed
violently whle they sucked her feet and legs and torso.  Then she
kissed his roommate as C and I worked her shorts off.  Then she
unzipped C's with her teeth and then mine with her teeth and then
C's roommate.  Holy shit.  So she alternated kissing each of us
and waved her ass invitingly to the other two, who would finger her
and kiss her all over.  After a while, she was totally giving me head
as I sat with my back against the wall, and she was kneeling over me
with her back arched beautifully sticking her ass way out.  C and
him fingered her as she gave me head for a long time.  I didn't come,
although I came close.  Oh, her ass was so pretty.  Then she frenched
me some more and then started giving C head.  I went to take a
piss and when I came out she was sucking off his roommate.  I got
dressed and shook C's hand and gave her a spank on the ass.  "It
was nice to meet you, A." That was so wild.  Later.</p>

<p>School starts in 9 hours.</p>

<p class=date>2:40AM Friday 28 Aug 1992.</p>

<p>Today is my last day of work.  Excellent!  "Today" I cleaned up
around the house and then went to the dorms to watch the Simpsons.
After that I went to the North East wing of Taub and chilled with
everyone there.  I left after a while with Heather, and we read comics
up in her room and then we did the crossword puzzle.  At about 1AM she
said she was going to bed and that I was welcome to stay in a non
sexual way.  Cool.  I didn't have my contact stuff, though so I had to
cruise.  That was unfortunate.  She is so so totally pretty.  I would
have enjoyed sleeping beside her.  I spent about 1 hour getting my bag
from Marcel's room, since he & Molly were at House of Pies when I
tried to get back in Taub.  Oh well.  I got it and I'm home.</p>

<p>On the way home as I drove along I-45 feeder, I saw probably 10 or
15 police cars FUCKING HAULING ASS on I45.  I was stopped at a light
and I heard a siren coming like crazy.  A cop car going way too fast
to make the turn slammed his brakes and skidded skidded and turned to
get on I45.  Shit.  I was afraid he was about to go smashing into one
of the pilings... Several wreckers were flying down the highway, too.
So I expect it was one gnarly wreck.  Later</p>

<p class=date>9:20Pm Friday August 28 1992</p>

<p>Yesterday I took notes while watching the Simpsons.  Bart wanted a
machine gun for his birthday so "we can hunt gangs, spell out things,
or bring in the new year!"</p>

<p>Bart's uncle: "Aren't you excited to see what it is?"</p>

<p>Bart: "Not really.  We peaked inside while you were in the john."</p>

<p>Today was my last day at work.  RIGHT!!!  They bought lunch from
Popeye's Chicken and they got me a cake with several different colors
air brushed on the icing.  I took the whole rest of the cake home in
my bag.  I kinda had to fold up the box to make it fit.</p>

<p>Right now I'm about to go to the dorms and go to House of Pies and
spend the night and then go to the VAX and then have a picnic at 1PM
and then who knows what in the afternoon and then pick up Laura from
Hobby airport at 9PM.  Later</p>

<p class=date>11:05AM Thursday 27 Aug 92</p>

<p>I've been running around with everyone almost continuously.  Maggie
and John seem detatched from the group.  I rarely see one without the
other.  I miss talking to Maggie privately.  Molly has seemed more
attached to me.  I have spent the last 2 nights with her in her bed.
She's given me eargasms and cuddled bunches.  I asked why, and she
said basically that she's never been this horny before.  Ok... I don't
know exactly what to do with that, since I have too much respect for
her to try anything.  I imagine I'll talk to her at length about it
eventually.</p>

<p>Last night Marcel, Kim (friend of Greg's) Greg, Steve, me, Molly, &
Will went to see Lethal Weapon 3.  We got there and it turned out that
Greg got the tiems screwed up, so we had 1.5 hours till the movie
started.  So we walked across Westheimer after dark where it's nine
lanes wide to Toys R Us.  We checked out the Legos and messed around
until we got bored and went to the Galleria Marble Slab.  We watched a
dude in the skating rink do some <em>smooth</em> moves - swerving in
and out of people, turning 120 degrees in an 8 foot radius with the
arc ending parallel to the wall 5 inches away from it.  <em>Fast</em>
too.</p>

<p>Then we went and watched the movie.  I brought my day planner and
took notes on the funnier lines.  Cool.  We went back to the dorms and
I followed the loud music and re-met Eric, Michael, Heather, Celeste,
Elizabeth.  I met Chris and Tim and Jerry.  I sat by Heather, who was
not drinking and talked to her a bit.  I mentioned that I have a list
of CDs that I want to get.  She said she has a list of Steinbeck books
that she doesn't have.  Cool.  Celeste has braces, that are almost
perfect for me, but she is 3 years younger than I.  As I stood by the
door, Elizabeth patted my crotch, "Genital tag! You're it!"  Woah.
That was interesting.  After a while she said she wanted it back, so I
gave it to her.  I hung with them for a while and then I cruised to OB
where Molly, Steve, Judy and Jeanine were playing cards.  I did
pushups and situps and then went to Molly's room and took a shower.
Molly came back with Jeanine, and I traded back massages with Jen. I
fell asleep on the floor and Molly fell asleep on the bed and Jeanine
left.  I woke in the middle of the night cause I was cold, so I
crawled into bed with Molly.  I remember her giving me an extensive
eargasm.  We woke at about 10:30AM and I came home.  Fred was here and
we talked about what we've been doing.  He's loving band.  They've
been practicing 9 hours per day.  He's doing very well in there, too.
The following happened: The band director asked if someone could play
a <em>low</em> C.  Fred raised his hand.  He played the C
<em>loud</em>.  The director asked if he could play it louder.  He
did.  Then the director was like, "excellent." He asked the next dude
to play it.  He did and the director said, "Ok, work on that."
RIGHT!!!</p>
