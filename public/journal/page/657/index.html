<p class=date>Thursday 17 December 1998</p>

<p>HI!

<p>Yesterday I was at Record Rack and found a totally super duper cool CD!  It has several of my favorite 80s dance club songs!! Do you remember these???

<p><table>
<tr><td align="right"><b>artist</b></td><td><em>song</em></td></tr>
<tr><td align="right"><b>A Split Second</b></td><td><em>Rigor Mortis</em></td></tr>
<tr><td align="right"><b>Section 25</b></td><td><em>Looking from a Hilltop</em></td></tr>
<tr><td align="right"><b>Airplane Crashers</b></td><td><em>White Rabbit</em></td></tr>
<tr><td align="right"><b>Ministry</b></td><td><em>Halloween (mix)</em></td></tr>
<tr><td align="right"><b>Nitzer Ebb</b></td><td><em>Join in the Chant</em></td></tr>
<tr><td align="right"><b>New Order</b></td><td><em>Bizarre Love Triangle</em></td></tr>
<tr><td align="right"><b>Front 242</b></td><td><em>Headhunter</em></td></tr>
<tr><td align="right"><b>Poesie Noire</b></td><td><em>Pity for the Self</em></td></tr>
</table>

<pre>
Since I posted this, I've had a few people inquire about where to 
find this lovely CD.  Here is my answer:

The CD is only available at <a href="https://www.recordrack.com">Record Rack</a> in Houston.  
Bruce, the owner of Record Rack, used to own
Numbers where the DJ worked who made the CD.  It's a compilation CD
made by DJ wES wALLACE

Email Bruce and see if there are any more available. I
bought it in like 1998 I think...  He will happily
ship one to you.
</pre>

<p>To be honest, I didn't actually recognize that I knew the Nitzer Ebb song, but all the others I recognized as songs I love!

<p>I was so excited because they are all the exact mixes that I remember ('cept for <em>Halloween</em>), which was cool because I had previously found a CD with "Looking From a Hilltop" on it and I bought the CD, but it was a different mix! Argh!

<p>*AND* it includes the <b>Airplane Crashers</b> song, which I have wanted for a super long time, but it's been out of print!

<p>I nostalgically (sp) listened through all the songs before I bought it with a super happy smile on my face.  I actually would have gotten it just for Airplane Crashers, but all of them were perfect.  I didn't mind that Ministry was a mix because I have a copy of it on a <em>Halloween</em> single.


<p>Enough about that.  Oh wait! I also bought <b>Beastie Boys</b> <em>hello nasty</em> poster, the one with the three of them in the sardine tin.

<p><hr width="40%">

<p>I sold another Flashnet account to Jeffrey, a guy who works at Kinko's where I got my Flashnet business cards made!

<p>While chatting with Jen on ICQ, I happened to remember a <a
href="/writing/old/funny_classics/margins.html">self-referential</a>
newsgroup posting. When I looked at it, there were only 7 hits on its
counter!!!  I think it's funny enough to deserve more hits than that,
so go check it out!  If you don't like it, <a
href="mailto:rob@robnugen.com">email me</a>.

<p>Tomorrow I'm going skating in the morning with my friend Ben. It's been a long time since we've been skating together.

<p>Fred, my brother, wants a daily desk calendar with a word for each day of 1999.  Wende, my ex-girlfriend still good friend, loves Winnie the Pooh.  I bought Fred the calendar he wanted, and a Pooh calendar for Wende.  So?  So I switched the boxes and wrapped them that way.

<p>Fred will not be too excited about Pooh, nor will Wende about a word per day.  I hope I'm there to see them both open 'em!

<p class=date>Monday 14 December 1998</p>
<br>(day 10491)

<p>Last night Manda and I saw the movie _Modulations_.  From their <a href="https://www.modulations.com">website</a>: "Modulations traces the evolution of electronic music as one of the most profound artistic developments of the 20th century."

<p>Modulations was certainly super rad; it made me really really want to go check out a rave *NOW* but I had no idea where one might be on Sunday night.  It was just about the right mix of sound/light vs technical and historical documentary, but I would have liked more (and louder) on the soundtrack part.  They didn't go too much into the minds of the rave crowds, but described pretty thoroughly the music.  Like where "house music" started and why it's called that.  And how the British scene changed and resulted in the creation of jungle music. 

<p>(I'm not giving away the answers (unless you ask) so I won't ruin the movie for you)

<p>They had lots of interviews of different djs and magazine writers.  I only knew a 2 of the names: dj spooky and invisible skratch picklz

<p>If the rave scene or electronic music intrigues you, go check out the film.

<h1>STATE OF MY LIFE</h1>

<p><ol>

<p><li>It's about time for another journal entry.  (HI Lisa!)</li>

<p><li>Just last weekend I drove to Little Rock, Arkansas with a little side trip to Tulsa, Oklahoma to pick up some youth for a rally!</li>

<p><li>This weekend, in three hours, I'm picking up Jeremy and Cathy from the bus station and then Nick up along I-45, and we'll go to Dallas for Maia's Social Action Conference!</li>

<p><li>I haven't packed yet.</li>

<p><li>I'm *almost* done with my <a href="/travel/costa_rica/1998/">Costa Rica</a> stories!</li>

<p><li>Today Bridge and I went to Souper Salad for lunch. We're friends from high school but we hadn't seen each other in like 5 or 8 years!</li>

<p><li>It's getting cold!  Three days ago we had 75 degree weather here in Houston.  Today and for the past couple days it's been icky wet and rainy like 45 degrees it seems.  We actually had to use the heater last night!</li>

<p><li>Amanda and I, both being "afraid" of committment, have committed to each other for 1 month.  It reminds me of the song "<a href="https://www.lyrics.ch/query/get?s=64289">Popular</a>" by Nada Surf</li>

<p><li>I'm doubly super excited about Flashnet and have made my <a href="https://www.flash.net/~robnugen">Flashnet</a> website even cooler!</li>
</ol>

                        <p><title>Little Rock Rally</title></p>

<p class=date>4-6 December 1998</p>

<p>Leaving Houston at 9:30am, I drove kT Hammons and Nicole Mauldin up to Tulsa to pick up Frank Roesler and Eryn Pope.  I had forgotten to get a map to the Tulsa church, but we stopped by a McDonald's and used their phone book and figured it out.

<p>Said HI to Ashley Robinson, Stacey Craig, and a couple others after I took a quick nap at the Tulsa church. Then we were on our way after a quick stop at Wendy's for food.

<p>Frank cracked me up and I almost snarfed with his hilarious beat box sounds. Had to be there.

<p>Got to Little Rock at about midnight.  Signed in and hugged and said HI to everyone and opening circle Matt and Mari Mock and Gene Hudnall and Nick Gruenewald made all the announcements and stuff.  A game of Mafia followed, and it was super cool because we who were Mafia, happened to all be right next to each other in the circle!  (Except for 1 person who we killed first)

<p>It was me, Eryn Pope, Bryan Beck, Danny K, and uh oh.. I'm in trouble. I don't remember who else was mafia.  Mafia won, since Bryan volunteered himself to die and threw off the whole group.

<p>Then I did sleep sleep sleep almost through breakfast and then watched Pulp Fiction and then hung out on the porch with Bryan and Eryn near JoEllen's spirituality workshop.  Aaron Ivener showed up with one of his friends a chatted for a bit.

<p>Yoga workshop then massage workshop, where I volunteered to be massaged by the woman doing the workshop. Yay!

<p>Eryn and I played with Jenga blocks, seeing how high we could stack them.  Then a dude whose name I forgot brought a bunch of drums and stuff and taught us some beats and a dance and all kinds of fun.

<p>Then Nick G stacked up the Jenga blocks in the highest stack we had been able to do and we took some pictures of it.  I went to bed, but apparently he placed one of those black music stands on top of it!  There are rumors that he got a picture of it, and other rumors that it fell off and hit him on the head first.

<p>Slept through talent show (sorry, guys) and no Silent Football (you could have played without me!) and woke up at 4am for a brief walk around the church then back to bed for a few hours.

<p>Slept through cleanup and then we snagged breakfast and closing circle sang Yogi Bear and good friends and stuff.

<p>Bright yellow covers on the mugbooks, but I've lost mine before I could put it in the Big Gray Rally Book. Pooh.  Wonderful fun rally!

<p>I have begun a new directory for my trip to Costa Rica.
At this point, it's only a tiny outline. I'll write more after I get my pictures back from Walgreen's, and have a sense of what I can scan.

<p>I'll write another entry in this general journal section when I'm completed with everything, or if you want to watch the progress, click

<p class=date>19 September 1998</p>

<p><img src="/images/rob/rob_fountain.jpg" align="left" alt="Rob in Phoenix 1993">

<p>Wow!  I finally was able to get Windows 95 going enough that I could scan an image!  The weird thing however, is that I can't get Windows to properly support my monitor.  It will only go to 640X480 pixels in 16 colors.

<p>10 years ago that woulda been great!

<p>But anyway, I scanned this image, uploaded it to my site, exited Windows, went to bed early (10pm), woke up (it's 5:34am), booted Linux, used GIMP (Gnu Image Manipulation Program) to adjust the color of the image, and re-uploaded it.

<p>And <i>bing</i> here's the result!  The scanner seemed to have some problem with streaking or something, but hey -- *I* can tell it's me!

<p>This picture was taken in August 1993 by Jeanette, my second cousin from Phoenix who attends school in Tucson.  We were at the Phoenix airport and I felt rushed to get onto the plane on time and I was all, "oh Jeanette hurry!" but she made me pose by the fountain.

<p>I made it to the plane on time.  I love the picture.  :-)  Hugs to Jeanette for encouraging me to take a moment.

<p>(now I gotta find her email address!)

<p>So yes, I may soon upload some more images that I've been
promising..  I certainly look forward to making the process a bit
shorter.  Maybe I can get Thomas to figure out why my monitor drivers
won't work.</p>

<p>Happy Birthday Tammy!  Happy Birthday Wendy!

<p>The excitement exhibited in the above wishes is forced. I am scared.

<p>I'm leaving for Costa Rica in 6 hours.  I'm nervous as hell.  I have just recognized this feeling a few minutes ago as I'm sitting here writing email, sending the Feel Good Net, updating my site, I thinking, um.. hey <em>I haven't packed yet.</em>

<p>Close my eyes, .. what's the deal?  (No pun intended (inside joke)) My stomach has butterflies, I feel like hurling; I feel like crying.

<p>I just cried.  I feel better, but my stomach still has butterflies.

<p>I'm going to start packing now.

<p>See ya in 8 days.

<p>I am leaving for Costa Rica in 17 hours!!!

<p>Last night I was up until 3am talking and stuff to Manda.  Then today I woke up, did laundry, got travelers checks (tried to go to AAA to do it, but they wouldn't let me in with no shoes (the security guard said, "if they don't mind, I don't mind" so I went in and then he brought to the manager's attention that I was barefoot, and then said that I needed to leave.) so I went to Nationsbank, and I'm glad because the teller was funny!), dropped off some books, picked up some cash, made some copies at Kinko's, went to Walgreens and got a ton of film, then came home and worked on Rebecca's <a href="https://www.indigoangel.com">website</a> for 2 hours then went to bed.

<p>Went to visit my dad's uncle Kermit (I'm not lying; his name is Kermit) who is in town for some kind of medical stuff and then went to gymnastics and am back home catching up on email and webstuff.

<p>I want to transcribe my diary entry from the weekend, because I know if I don't do it before Costa Rica, I'll never get it done.

<p>I'll be back on Thanksgiving Day!
