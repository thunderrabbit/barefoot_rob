<p class=date>9:55am CST Wednesday 13 March 2002</p></p>

<p>Just got back from the eye doctor.  Rode my bike.  I cannot see
what I'm typing unless I get really close to the screen.  Conference
call in 5 minutes.</p>

<p class=date>11:53am</p>

<p>Conference call with Minh and Jon Walker was fine.  My eyes are
plenty better now.  During the conference call I fixed a problem with
the ADS project (added variables to the change_user_info screen) and
listened to Jon talk about his adventures in London and Paris.</p>

<p>Now I'm about to begin a nin din and work on the Branding! survey.
That's the one I showed Bryn yesterday.</p>

<p class=date>5:44pm</p>

<p>So I got all the changes done for the OS survey, all except getting
the font to be arial in Netscape, but oh well.  And now I'm going to
purchase thermal underwear to stay warm overseas!  I wonder if I can
get thermal underoos!</p>

<p>Oh shit I just realized that I was asked to give another quote on a
survey, but I didn't do it yet.</p>

<p>I'm at Dude's house doing last minute
try-to-catch-up my website stuff.  Optimizing the
large amount (27 megs) of pics from Houston rally to
about 1/2 that amount of space.  But Dude's FTP client
keeps locking up so I can't get them moved over. 
Maybe I'll archive them all, ftp that over, and then
unzip the archive on my site.</p>

<p>But I just remembered that I'm on my bike tonight
and I'm a bit tired for riding home.  I may choose to
stop by work and do a bit of investment club stuff to
prepare for next month's meeting.</p>

<p>I just want to get that out of the way before I
leave tomorrow!</p>

<p>I just got a thing notarized so Wende can sign for me at our house
closing while I'm galavanting around London and Paris with Bryn!  How
ironic that I've been putting off the notarization because of the
inconvenience and I find out that Jerri across the hall at work is a
notary.  She didn't even charge me, so I'll send her a postcard.</p>

<p>This is even better than Mia in Pulp Fiction at Jack Rabbit Slims
when she goes to the restroom and comes back to find her food waiting.
I'm going to Europe, come back and my house will be sold!</p>

<p class=date>12:31pm same day</p>

<p>I have just returned from lunch with Wende; I gave her the
notarized form, helped her turn in the checks for investment club;
exchanged $137-ish for 90 British pounds.  Saw Mark Leonard from
ultimate there at the Galleria.  Actually he saw me first.  Saw Amy as
well.  Actually she saw me first.</p>

<p>Saw the Build-A-Bear store, where one can pick the fur, stuffing,
clothes, accessories for a new teddy bear or rabbit or others I'm
sure.  Wow.  It was relatively packed with 5 - 7 year old girls and
moms.</p>

<p>Watched the 9|11 thing last night at Dude's house with Dude and
Gene.  Dude had to leave for part of it to pick up Veronica, whose car
decided not to start.</p>

<p>I was most taken with how dark it got when they each fell.  That
floodlight on those cameras are <em>bright</em> and they could only
see a few inches away.</p>

<p>Gene got really pissed all over again about the whole thing.  I
asked him later what he was going to do [to release his anger], but he
said he'd be alright.  I hope so.</p>

<p>YRUU was fun and chillin' today.  I took pics of people there,
except for Smom, who had to leave early.</p>

<p><a href="/images/YRUU/peeps/hethre.jpg"><img
src="/images/YRUU/peeps/thumbs/hethre.jpg"></a> Hethre is from our local YRUU; she
is excellent in photojournalism; wants to be a concert promoter for
some cool band or artist.  She's editor of This Is Bad, and one more
new zine the nname of which I forgot.  A one word thing like Smelg.</p>

<p>The next three are from Beaumont; they may start coming once per
month because they like us.</p>

<p><a href="/images/YRUU/peeps/laura.jpg"><img
src="/images/YRUU/peeps/thumbs/laura.jpg"></a>Laura has been amazingly active in
our district and continental YRUU.  She's been on YAC and has been our
YCR, has served on Youth Council, and maybe Steering Committee!  Laura
= wow.</p>

<p><a href="/images/YRUU/peeps/jack.jpg"><img
src="/images/YRUU/peeps/thumbs/jack.jpg"></a>Jack is amazing in his life history.
He always wins the Ten Fingers game, where people say, "I have never
....." and fill in the blank with something they have never done.
Whoever has done that has to lower a finger.  Jack always in the last
with fingers up.</p>

<p><a href="/images/YRUU/peeps/natalie.jpg"><img
src="/images/YRUU/peeps/thumbs/natalie.jpg"></a>Natalie is a friend of Jack and
Laura's; I don't know much about her.  Okay; I know nothing about her.
But she was cool and fit right in with us.</p>

<p><a href="/images/YRUU/peeps/jeff.jpg"><img
src="/images/YRUU/peeps/thumbs/jeff.jpg"></a>Jeff is another advisor for the local
YRUU.  He has been to a few rallies and always wears that funny hat.
He fits right in at the Rennaisance Festival!</p>

<p>I have fallen in love with Amy even more today but she's MARRIED I
had to keep telling myself and remind myself how horrible it was with
a married couple as I screwed around with the wife.  Not that Amy has
given me <em>any</em> indication that she would partake in any
indescretion (right word?) except being smily and happy and a tad
flirtatious.</p>

<p>As Amy and I were leaving Mission Burrito (after a lovely lunch) in
her BMW, I was watching traffic as she planned to turn right though
there was a big truck blocking our view of the traffic and she saw me
loooking and guessed (correctly) I was maybe a bit nervous, put her
hand up to block my eyes saying, "trust me" and I licked her hand.
She neither winced nor squeaked nor slapped me (nor oooh nor ahhed nor
left her hand there.)</p>

<p>Anyway, she's <em>hot</em> and active and cute and funny and
listens to The Box (hip hop) and several other things I'm sure.  But
she's married and likes to drink.  And she's only 26.  Sigh.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class=date>12:12pm Sunday 10 March 2002</p>

<p>Talked to Amy for 32 minutes this morning, prompted by my need to
get a ride from the airport after returning from London and Paris with
Bryn.  Told Amy about my weekend and listened to fun stories about
their pool turning green recently.  (so recent that hubby is out
getting chlorine tablets now)</p>

<p>I offered to let Amy listen to my most recently recorded KTRU
tape.</p>

<p>I found this in <a
href='https://www.theharrowgroup.com/articles/20020218/20020218.htm#_Toc1472058'>The
Harrow Technology Report.</a></p>

<pre>
Ian Pearson and Ian Neild of BTexact Technologies (an
offshoot of British Telecom), use the information
available from many sources (including The Harrow
Technology Report, I'm pleased to say), plus their own
expertise, to assign probable dates to significant
technological events.  And the results can be very
interesting and instructive.  Consider these few
examples:

-         2003 - first synthetic organic life form.

-         2005 - computers that write their own
software.

-         2006 - first artificial electronic life, and
first organism brought back from extinction.

-         2010 - highest earning celebrity is
synthetic.

-         2015 - machine use of human-like creativity

-         2020 - electronic life form given basic
rights, and insect-sized robots banned in gardens due
to effects on wildlife.

Ian and Ian's timeline offers many, many more examples
in the areas of Artificial Intelligence,
Biotechnology, Business & Education, Demographics,
Displays, Energy, the Environment, Home & Office
Technology, Living in a Cyberworld, Machine Senses,
Materials Sciences, Computer Electronics, Robotics,
and more.  They offer a thought-provoking walk through
our possible future history. 

The paper is available at 
<br><a
href='https://www.btexact.com/white_papers/downloads/WP106.pdf'>https://www.btexact.com/white_papers/downloads/WP106.pdf</a>.
May you find it as thought-provoking as did I.

<p><a href="https://www.amymultimedia.com">Amy</a> is helping us design
our website, so she was meeting with Karla over here today.  She and I
have entertained each other through AIM, so today we went to lunch at
Mission Burrito.  Great time.</p>

<p>I'm hoping to get past the fall-in-love-with-her stage pretty
quickly, considering she is married and therefore quite unavailable.</p>

<p>She sure is cute.</p>

<p>In other news, I wrote wrote more documentation today, finalized
the changes for Patrick for the SAD survey, and something else
interesting - oh helped Patrick build a cost proposal for the peeps in
Singapore.  Oh and had a 1.25 hour meeting with one of our bigger
clients.</p>

<p>The wall outside has only 3 panels remaining past the texas
silhouette panel.  Wende has my camera though.</p>

<p>I slept for 2 hours after work and woke up, looked at my phone
clock - exactly 9:00 o'clock, which is cool because Lee-eh said she
would call me after 9.  But she didn't call and I went to Whole Foods
to get a pile of veggies and some fruit as a result of talking to
Richard, my nutritionist who suggested I cut up veggies each week, put
lemon juice on them and munch some each morning with protein, eggs
maybe.</p>

<p>I got some $5.99 per pound loof looking sealed in water veggie for
free because it didn't scan and the cashier was all, "don't worry
about it," and slid it on down the belt.</p>

<p>I felt WAY energetic (after my 2 hour nap) and called Lee-eh and
she was with friends (girls' night out, I learned later), called Tejus
at KTRU, but there was a baseball game going on instead of MK Ultra,
called Gene, but he was choosing to stay put for the evening, called
dude, but no answer, called Amy but no answer.  This Amy is a friend
of Gene's and I don't know her last name, but at one point, we both
learned that we both enjoy dancing-to-sweat high energy dancing at
Numbers, so I called her to see if she was up for it, but no
answer.</p>

<p>Took Spot for a walk (followed him around the complex as he sniffed
around; I was on headset phone talking to Wende) and everything was
great until we got to the other side of the complex and he wanted to
kick the asses of 2 cats in an apartment so he clawed the window and
got caught on the screen and when I grabbed him he had the screen
attached to his paws like a worker carrying a huge pane of glass using
the suction cup deals and it was actually pretty funny except it was
11:45pm.</p>

<p>I leaned the screen against the wall under the window, grabbed Spot
who was meowerling and took him home.</p>

<p>Went back and left a note to explain why their screen was off.
Even drew a picture of Spot with it attached to his claws.</p>

<p>Last night after work, I zipped over to Jennifer's work to do
investment club research with her and Eddie.  I told them that I was
quite uninspired to do any research, and I didn't think I was doing
enough work as president to be good for the club.</p>

<p>Basically, I want to quit.</p>

<p>I'll bring this up with the club tonight, and see what is the club
decision about what to do.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Afterward, cruised over to Dude's for Wednesday Night Dinner,
starring Gene The Chef, and chicken with angel hair pasta.
Yummmee.</p>

<p>We played a couple rounds of Captain Video (hellyeah, gettin' the
YRUU games out to the real world) and then some Beyond Balderdash
(more than just definitions of words, but also who was this person,
what's the plot of this movie, what's the definition of this acronym,
and one more.)</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Went to Gene's uncle's house to shoot the bull and shoot some pool
until about 3am I think.  Fun stuff.  Gene is cool.</p>

<p>We talked about my favorite theological, philosophical things -
those unknowables of the world.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>This morning I went to see Richard, a nutritionist because when I
went for my physical, Dr Nellie was all, "you're healthy, but your
eating habits suck," or something like that.  He gave me some good
ideas that I may do.  Basically, eat good stuff more often.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Now I'm at work, workin' on the second fix to the code for Patrick
that I fixed at 3:30am two nights ago.</p>

<p>One week until London!</p>

<p class=date>5:31pm</p>

<p>Leaving now.  Got some more pics of the wall being torn down.
Finished coding the code I was working on; just need to test it
tomorrow.  And write documentation on how to run some reports.  And do
a cost proposal for the singapore clients.  fun.</p>
