<p>Tonight before ASL, I went to Container Store and got some
goodies for my apartment. after ASL, I visited Wende's house (our old
house that I'm already able to call Wende's house, vs my apartment) to
pack up more stuff.  Five boxes worth.  Thankful to her for helping
make it so easy to separate stuff.</p>

<p><em>Monsters, Inc</em> was *brilliant*!!!</p>

<p>You absolutely <em>must</em> see this movie because (in no
particular order):</p>

<p><ul>
<li>It was funny</li>
<li>It was fully computer animated</li>
<li>The writing was brilliant</li>
<li>All of the above reasons again</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>I totally loved this film.  I thought all the good stories were
written, and this one comes along and produces a whole new setting,
ready for a million new stories to come out of it.</p>

<p>The chase scene near the end of the movie was great roller coastery
fun.  Go see it!</p>

<p>Oh!  And, speaking of new stories, Star Wars Episode II, <em>Attack
of the Clones</em> trailer appeared before Monsters, Inc.  The entire
soundtrack of the trailer was Darth Vader's breath while we watched
varied and random scenes.  Then we hear <em>vwack vwack</em> of two
light sabers and that was it.  More movie brilliance.</p>

<p>Let's see how much I can remember.  Today was full.</p>

<p>Ultimate at 10:30am after packing some boxes and loading them in my
car.  Books, clothes, letters and stuff.</p>

<p>At ultimate we played The Chicken Huckers for the third time.  We
beat them for the third time as well.  They were playing without any
subs; we had 2 male and 2 female subs.  Fluff is <em>undefeated</em>
this season!!!  Only thing left is the finals.</p>

<p>Dropped off my boxes at the apartment, took a shower, drove to
Dude's house and borrowed his truck.  Met up with Eric at my house and
we loaded my bed, chest of drawers, night stand, wooden desk, wooden
shelves, old computer, and more boxes into Dude's truck and Eric's
truck.  Super thanks to them for their vehicles!</p>

<p>Unloaded everything and I was pretty much ready to sleep, which I
did after paying my rent (almost forgot!) and talking to Amanda at the
apartment office place.  (This is not (A)Manda from UH) I met Rick and
Bonnie and Mary and Jean (sp) and Tony today.  I think I'm really
gonna like my apartment complex.  Bonnie has lived there for 30 years.
She's basically lived there all my life.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Took a nap for an hour, dropped off Dude's truck, then stopped by
Paint This! on the way to KTRU.  Painted a bit of green and purple on
Wende's plate.  I really like this plate.  I'm trying some new
techniques on it.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>KTRU seemed more full of odd music than normal.  And other odd
stuff.  The EAS machine suddenly spat a message, "The Required Weekly
Test Has Not Been Run For 8 Days," so I got to run the weekly EAS
test, including saying, "The following is a test of the Emergency
Alert System.  This is only a test."</p>

<p>Got a call from Phat Pat and Tina, who requested music and I played
"Kid (something)" by The Groceries for Katy's birthday being
celebrated at Qax Pyte tonight.</p>

<p>Got two calls from a girl who seemed <em>desperate</em> to hear her
request.  I played Old 97's the first time and then Pavement the
second time she called.  Very annoying.  I played Pavement and didn't
realize that I've heard the song a zillion times before (didn't
recognize the title, but I recognized the song, which is now stuck in
my head, thank-her-very-much.)</p>

<p>Something else happened I'm sure, but I dunno what.</p>

<p>I was surprised to see a cop car on both sides of
the Hazard Street bridge as I drove to work.  I
stopped and asked "What are you doing?"</p>

<p>"guarding the bridge."</p>

<p>"I was afraid you were going to say that."</p>

<p>If a vehicle stops on the bridge, they are to block
traffic from entering the bridge (and I guess confront
the guy or whatever).  If a vehicle stops under the
bridge, same thing.  Not that he can see what's going
on under the bridge, but the other cops on the other
bridges can.  Wow.</p>

<p>This is apparently the mayor/police chief/other
public officials covering their ass after 4 bridges in
San Francisco have been targeted.  As of now, they are
intact and apparently well guarded.</p>

<p>War sucks.</p>

<p>Well hey look at that.  It's November 1st and I still haven't even
hot synced my Visor with my computer to get the San Antonio Rally
online.  Someday soon-ish-ly maybe I'll do that.</p>

<p>Been moving moving boxes mostly books and went to Target with Wende
last night and bought a lotta household stuff, including a cute shower
curtain called "Happy Frogs" with big smiling frogs on it.  :-)</p>

<p>I realize today that I have more books than I am likely to ever
read.  I'm going to start giving them away.  There are some I know I'm
only holding for sentimental reasons, but that I'll never use again.
For example, my college computer programming books, like the
Programming in the X Window system, and LISP, and The Complete C
Reference. and C++ for C Programmers.  Maybe I'll offer them to
Graham or Brian from 1st church.</p>

<p>I still code in Perl; I'm keeping those.</p>

<p>I found a couple of books that should have okay resale value at
Half Price Books. I'll try that as well.</p>

<p>I want to feature my Marble Track in my apartment, but I'm not sure
where or how.  I'd like to begin work on it again, and the paper clock
Wende gave me back in the day, and to finalize the marble clock that I
rebuilt some years ago.</p>

<p class=date>9:32pm CST Tuesday 30 October 2001</p></p>

<p>Today just after we lost internet connectivity at work, I cruised
over to the apartment place and signed the lease.  It took a lot
longer than I expected, but it's all good.  By the time I got back to
work, we still didn't have internet access.</p>

<p>It felt strange to be poring over all the legalese in the lease.
Strange to be reading a lease at all.  I vaguely remembered the same
experience from 1989 when Tammy and I moved into our apartment in the
Greenspoint area.  I think I like this complex a lot better - it seems
homelier and friendlier.</p>

<p>This evening after ASL, I dropped off a box of books (my journals,
actually), and my plumeria, which now has about 20 leaves.  I met Kay,
Donna, Karen (I think those were their names.)  Kay was moving out
because the place was getting too rowdy - just the opposite of what I
heard from the manager and stuff.  We'll see how it goes.</p>

<p>My phone number will stay the same.  I'm thankful for that.  :-)</p>

<p class=dream>The Probable Cause Particle is a
particle that looks at something while the attention
of the original viewer is directed somewheree else. 
However, the probable cause particle's focus can only
be discerned by the son of the original viewer,
otherwise the probable cause particle's focus shifts
to some random other point in the universe.</p>

<p>This was much more profound when I dreamt it.</p>

                        <p>Remember the loving feeling of wanting so much for Bryn to feel
comfortable with her decision about whether or not to attend ACT class
tomorrow in the AM (in 3 hours or so) maybe 5 hours.  Hug hug hug and
just so much love expressed for her.  I Love You sign as I said bye to
her.  She was on the phone in the kitchen and I left for bed.</p>

<p class=date>12:19pm Saturday 27 October 2001</p>

<p>Absolutely precious when I talked to Bryn deep meaningful
convesation where she queried me about relationship with Wende and i
answered as best I could.</p>

<p>She told me about her feelings and sadness lately since she&rsquo;s been
back in USA and stuff.  Seems that one of her life&rsquo;s greatest fears is
having people leave her.  I felt so belssed by her precious tears; I
know it is difficult for Bryn to cry in front of others.</p>

<p>Bryn and I talked all the way until the entire rally was leaving
for Social Action.  So blessed I felt getting to hang out with her
even longer.</p>

<p>San Antonio Rally

<p>The most surprising of all was to find Troy Scott here as one of
the rovers here tonight.  Troy Scott! He attended YRUU with me back in
the day.  He could juggle and tell jokes and drew The Brawn Hand
Blender.  Big hug to him and traded email addresses.</p>

<p>He's doing juggling and cool things for his living now.  Good job,
Troy!</p>

<p>Just as I was about to go to sleep, and Troy was finished with his
roving duty, he was all, "oh!  I could do balloons!"  He's a
professional noodle balloon artist.  Here are some of the amazing
things he made out of balloons:</p>

<p><ul>
<li>eyes, including pupil, cornea, white</li>
<li>He made a bear behind his back</li>
<li>2 bears hugging</li>
<li>snake with rattle</li>
<li>beanie with spinning propeller</li>
<li>monkey</li>
<li>Goofy</li>
<li>made Mark VS a cow with udder</li>
<li>horse with mane + marker = zebra</li>
<li>duck</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Uh oh.  It's been so long since I wrote this, I don't remember what
was so funny.  Is this two half finished jokes?  Anyone remember?</p>

<pre>
knock knock
who's there?
why did the fireman wear red suspenders?
</pre>

<p>Here is a song that Troy made up for us:</p>

<pre>
this... is... the san antonio rally song
it isn't very long
