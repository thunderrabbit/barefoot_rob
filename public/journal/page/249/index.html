                        <p>During my lesson with Mogi-san, I got a call from AB saying their image system wasn&rsquo;t working.  Hmmm.  I asked them to create a ticket and she was like &ldquo;okay&rdquo; while I sent a quick email to Alfonzo because he&rsquo;s the one who deals with the image system.</p>

<pre><code>_______ says she can't upload images.

I haven’t confirmed; I’m in a lesson.

I aksed her to make a redmine ticket, but she can’t select you as the Assignee.
</code></pre>

<p>The ticket came through, but it was on the wrong tracker!!  wth?</p>

<p>I really had a brainfarzzled moment where I thought I was dreaming or taking crazy pills!</p>

<p>Oh, the other tracker is for another client who is also using the same image system.  Shit. I guess it&rsquo;s really broken.  I hope it&rsquo;s an easy fix.</p>

                        <p>On the way to lesson with Mutsumi and Mutsumi, there&rsquo;s a Lotus dealership.  I used to have a Lotus, <em>cough</em> hotwheels <em>cough</em>, and it didn&rsquo;t last more than a year, so I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll need another.  But today I walked to that side of the street and took a picture of cars in the showroom.</p>

<p>Continued on that side of the street and found a cool toy shop!  Sweet stuff including a very difficult marble track &ldquo;puzzle&rdquo; (not quite the right word) which I could make, given the right tools.  It&rsquo;s on sale for several dollars.  Like it&rsquo;s custom made or something.</p>

<p>They also had a product they called &ldquo;Dancing Sand&rdquo; which is 98% sand and 2% some non-sticky shit that makes the sand not quite stick together. Makes cleanup a breeeeeze.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll go back to that shop when I have more time.</p>

                        <p>Things to do related to this Hakyll static site:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Make sure I&rsquo;m not being charged for my micro instance on AWS.  If I am, then consider using Jekyll on DH.</p></li>

<li><p>Finish the git-based hook system for posting my journal online via git pushes.</p></li>

<li><p>Tweak the site generation code so the URLs include the date, and so the files themselves are organized in directories by date.  I don&rsquo;t want a bajillion files in one giant /posts directory (or even 100)</p></li>

<li><p>Write a macro(?) for SublimeText2 to create journal entry files.  Basically it will use the local date as default, then I&rsquo;ll give it a title and it will create the file with date-based path/name + title.markdown and then put the title in the meta data for the file and put the date as the top line (and a &lsquo;written date&rsquo; if I didn&rsquo;t use the default date of NOW)</p></li>

<li><p>Add tags</p></li>

<li><p>Figure out how to put images in this format.   Egad.  That&rsquo;s what pushed me off my Perl based version in the first place.</p></li>

<li><p>Use an importer for Jekyll to import my Wordpress journal entries into this format (unless there&rsquo;s one written for Hakyll, but they&rsquo;re pretty much the same format.)</p></li>

<li><p>Import journal entries from my old school journal indexed with the cgi script Fred and I wrote in Perl back in the day.</p></li>

<li><p>Import journal entries (and images) from the hoken blog thing.  (That might take way longer but we&rsquo;ll see if I can do it quickly based on how easily I can do the others.)</p></li>

<li><p>Leave those journals intact just for posterity.</p></li>

<li><p>Register SublimeText2</p></li>

<li><p>Tweak the CSS of the site to make it kewl.</p></li>

<li><p>Add comments (via Disqus or its rival probably)</p></li>

<li><p>Optionally, expand this site to include stuff like my old writings, from Feel Good Net to Wild Skating Adventures to various travel stories from my essentially defunct email list.Oh, and all the TIMES, ITEMS, PEEPS, etc stuff off my wiki, but leaving all the art related stuff.</p></li>

<li><p>Start moving other junk off my old provider (Dreamhost, you&rsquo;ve been a great workhorse for many years; thank you.  I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll be in touch.)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure yet about one thing, though: what to call the domain during the transition.  I&rsquo;m thinking it will be new.robnugen.com to start, but I don&rsquo;t totally like it.  I could buy a new domain and let fly2.nu fly away, or one of the others I&rsquo;ve not really used.  Hmmm.</p>

<p>##a bit later##</p>

<p>The dark version is DarkFox&rsquo;s original CSS:</p>

                        <p>Here&rsquo;s a new recommendation for journaling: be able to journal anytime.  Until wifi is free everywhere I go, web-based journaling software just won&rsquo;t suffice.  Gotta have a book or in this case a laptop that I carry around.  Otherwise I lose countless moments to the lack of internet connectivity.</p>

<p>Today I went to JB for training on Wednesday morning lessons starting next week.  I&rsquo;m a bit nervous (?) teaching classes in a style I&rsquo;ve never taught before: 15 or 20 kids, 5 year old!</p>

<p>wut.</p>

<p>And actually there&rsquo;s a similarly sized class of 4 year old students.</p>

<p>Into what kind of madness am I getting myself?</p>

<p>I figure I need to treat it like when I broke out of my shell at University of Houston.  I was like, &ldquo;fuckit I&rsquo;m going to talk to people and do things.&rdquo;  In this case it&rsquo;s &ldquo;fuckit, I&rsquo;m going to act like I know how to act around kids!&rdquo;</p>

                        <p>Running Hakyll on <del>Dreamhost</del> AWS</p>

<p>UPDATE: <a href="/2014/10/30/tutorial-running-hakyll-for-free-on-aws/">Run Hakyll for free on AWS</a> is a better tutorial than the mess below.</p>

<p>I gave up trying to install Hakyll on Dreamhost when I realized I probably wouldn&rsquo;t be able to install Haskell at all. I have a ticket in to DH now, but I bet they&rsquo;ll say &ldquo;sorry, not on shared hosting; why don&rsquo;t you try our VPS?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The following is based on notes I took from <a href="https://marcanuy.com/en/notes/18-deploying-a-laravel-website-with-git">https://marcanuy.com/en/notes/18-deploying-a-laravel-website-with-git</a> (currently 404, RIP old link), and
<a href="https://chrisdone.com/posts/hakyll-and-git-for-you-blog">https://chrisdone.com/posts/hakyll-and-git-for-you-blog</a></p>

<p>This is a work in progress; better go elsewhere instead of follow the potholed minefield ahead:</p>

<p>Easy as</p>

<ol>
<li>get server with root access</li>
<li>set up Hakyll</li>
<li>set up git</li>
</ol>

<p>##1. sign up for AWS micro (free tier available)##</p>

<p>I will probably go with all their defaults:</p>

<p>####Step 1:####</p>

<p>For this, I&rsquo;m using <code>Amazon Linux AMI 2014.09.1 (HVM) - ami-b5a7ea85</code> because it&rsquo;s at the top of the AMI list when creating a new EC2 instance, offers a free tier, and includes Docker, which I&rsquo;ve heard about more than twice, but know nothing of it yet.</p>

<p>####Step 2:####</p>

<p>t2.micro (free tier eligible)</p>

<p>####Step 3 (Configture Instance details)####</p>

<p>leave defaults</p>

<p>####Step 4 Add Storage:####</p>

<p>Root /dev/xvda snap-62cf04aa  8GiB  <del>Magnetic</del> gp2  Not Encrypted</p>

<p>####Step 5 Tag Instance:####</p>

<p>Name : hakyll.robnugen.com</p>

<p>####Step 6 Configure Security Group:####</p>

<p>Create a new security group</p>

<p>Security group name: hakyll.robnugen.com</p>

<p>SSH from My IP</p>

<p>####Review and Launch####</p>

<p>I got a popup saying I can use SSD for free, so I&rsquo;m selecing that.  (I had selected Magnetic in step 4 above)</p>

<p>##2. Set up Hakyll on server##</p>

<p>##3. Set up git on server##</p>

<p>On Server, set up bare repo:</p>

<pre><code>cd ~/
mkdir bare
mkdir bare/hakyll.git
cd bare/hakyll.git 
git init --bare
</code></pre>

<p>Create hook for compiling the site after push:</p>

<pre><code>emacs ~/bare/hakyll.git/hooks/post-update
</code></pre>

<p>Make it look like this:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
work_tree=~/robnugen.com/hakyll
GIT_WORK_TREE=$work_tree git checkout -f
ghc --make hakyll
./hakyll build
</code></pre>

<p>// cd $work_tree</p>

<p>The very best thing about not using Wordpress or Hoken: I can repeat filenames and not have the URLs get mangled.</p>

<p>#State of My Life Address#</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I ain&rsquo;t journaled consistently for a long time.</p></li>

<li><p>I hope to become more consistent for years to come.</p></li>

<li><p>THis SOML might get cut short, though; Lin is about to arrive in 8 minutes.</p></li>

<li><p>Lin and I are married, living in Kawasaki, Japan.  We live in a two story house (paying rent, moe joe, but it&rsquo;s more space and less rent than our apartment was) and her mom lives downstairs.</p></li>

<li><p>We have two cats, Ted and Jennie.  Lin named Ted, and I named Jennie after Jennifer, who found a place for Spot to live after I left the US for Japan.</p></li>

<li><p>I have vaguely good ability to understand basic spoken Japanese, but am losing my ability to speak Japanese.  I&rsquo;ve been here 11+ years and it&rsquo;s starting to get embarrassing, but it just proves how lazy I am and how easy it is to live in a bubble here.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve been going around barefoot as much as possible for the last two years.  I&rsquo;m barefoot now, sitting in Kawasaki station as I wait for Lin to arrive.</p></li>

<li><p>Lin has just told me she&rsquo;ll be working for HJ starting in January.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve not worked full time in a while.  I stopped working at Accent after pissing off the boss at the other Accent by allegedly sexually harassing an employee, but really it was in jest and not meant in any kind of sexy way.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve been enjoying being a <del>lazy bum</del> er house husband, though I&rsquo;m working a bit here and there.</p></li>

<li><p>TJ Bike and I still ride around a bit, but his chain is rusty.  I often ride Lin&rsquo;s bike just because it&rsquo;s lighter.</p></li>

<li><p>We&rsquo;ve considered taking some long rides; we rode to her friend Mika&rsquo;s house a month ago or so ago, and planned to ride to Paola&rsquo;s after that, and Sourou&rsquo;s after that, and then an overnight adventure after that, but havne&rsquo;t done anything beyond riding to Mika&rsquo;s.</p></li>

<li><p>I plan to attend the next Tokyo ET communication night thing on 22 November.  Find the meetup group if you&rsquo;re interested, but please understand that on the first time, you won&rsquo;t be meeting ET close encounters style.  Might see some twinkling lights or whatnot.  (That&rsquo;s what I expect, but I probably need to drop even that expectiaton)</p></li>

<li><p>Tariq and I have teamed up with Christina in New York (I was just kidding when I called her <em>The Christina</em> a couple days ago) who does social network stuff.</p></li>

<li><p>We&rsquo;ve got three apps ready to release, but want to build up some excitement first.  I&rsquo;m super excited, but not sure if anything is really going to happen.  I&rsquo;ll let you know.</p></li>

<li><p>In the cat+computer room, Lin put down some <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inch foam rubber flooring. which the cats love to claw.  It&rsquo;s proving to be an excellent investment in keeping their claws off the walls!</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve got four mazes queued up for <a href="https://www.amazeaweek.net/">A Maze a Week</a>, but one is scheduled to go out tonight.</p></li>

<li><p>I just fixed the tab key on my keyboard.  It had gotten sticky and didn&rsquo;t travel quickly each time I pressed it.</p></li>

<li><p>My computer is &ldquo;Silver Monkey&rdquo;, a Macbook Pro about 2.5 years old.  I think it has a 15&rdquo; monitor.  It&rsquo;s running Yosemite (OS X 10.10)</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve been so anti-impressed with Apple for the past 2.25 years that I am sure I&rsquo;ll not buy another Mac with my own monies.   When this one starts to get tired of the OS upgrades, I&rsquo;ll switch to Ubuntu.</p></li>

<li><p>My phone is &ldquo;Little Blue Monkey&rdquo;, an iPhone 4S with iOS 7.1.</p></li>

<p>Boom.  Got me what might be my new journal for a long time to come, if I can figure out how to make the directory structure the way I want, and ifff I can figure out a way to put images in here that is fast and friendly and all that.</p>

<p>I -<em>might</em>- attempt to write a thingy in Haskell to do it.</p>

<p>For now, I just need to set up a way to serve this from Dreamhost.</p>
