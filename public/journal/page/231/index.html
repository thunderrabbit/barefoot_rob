<p>Bandit line</p>

<p>##10:58</p>

<p>nice!</p>

<p>##11:01</p>

<p>bicycles line</p>

<p>##11:05</p>

<p>fun! It&rsquo;s actually got hills and brake sections so it&rsquo;s arguably a coaster</p>

<p>##11:10</p>

<p>spinning ride where riders control the altitude on per car basis</p>

<p>##11:13</p>

<p>in line for scary house</p>

<p>##11:20</p>

<p>not so scary. No actors inside to scare (us), though Lin jumped a few times</p>

<p>##11:28</p>

<p>standing looping coaster configuration seems different than I remember from some years ago!</p>

<p>##11:35</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s short and sweet</p>

<p>##11:38</p>

<p>in line for sitting coaster Momonga</p>

<p>##12:05</p>

<p>Looping Starship and Lin semi enjoyed it!</p>

<p>##12:15</p>

<p>m food</p>

<p>##1:00p</p>

<p>saw sea lion show</p>

<p>##13:27</p>

<p>in line for save animals ride
Haha it would be easy to get out during the ride.</p>

<p>##13:51</p>

<p>crepes</p>

<p>##14:00</p>

<p>in line for water ride
I &ldquo;slept&rdquo; on the ride.
Took pics of Twist Robin ride or is it Robin Twister which opened in March but is not operating now.
Lin noticed some tape on the rails, and I noticed that it marks sections of the track which don&rsquo;t meet smoothly. Oops!!</p>

<p>##19:22</p>

<p>battery died after I took buncha pictures so notes don&rsquo;t have time stamps.</p>

<p>Saw Joel C, CCC on 52回, while in line for Bandit before dusk. Rode in last seat of last car!</p>

<p>Did go carts after that. I think it got dark then.</p>

<p>Then we did laser tag I thought but actually a variety of challenges in different rooms.</p>

<p>Then rode several little rides with no lines</p>

<p>Then ate fries then rode Ferris wheel. The Christmas lights across the park coat every shape in light.</p>

<p>Then rode one more small ride.</p>

<p>##19:27</p>

<p>in line for Bandit again.</p>

<p>##19:35</p>

<p>bandit was fun</p>

<p>##19:36</p>

<p>in line for Leather Atheletic but what is it?
Dunno, but it&rsquo;s warmer inside than outside.</p>

<p>##20:23</p>

<p>it was a set of three series of challenges. We tried and failed the C course together (approximately 20% pass rate from what I saw) and then I tried and failed the A course twice, getting past only the first challenge the first time and halfway through the fourth challenge (of five total) the second time.</p>

<p>##20:25</p>

<p>we are in line for the gondolas to go back to Keio Yomiuriland station.</p>

<p>##20:30</p>

<p>gondola starts now</p>

<p>##20:56</p>

<p>headed to Mikako&rsquo;s house for New Years</p>

<p>It was my first time to go to a temple for New Years in Japan.  It
wasn&rsquo;t as crowded as I expected, though there was a pretty long line
of people queued up to pray(?).  There was a bit of a mob near the
bell that emanated some great reverberations each time a group went up
to ring it.  I was like, &ldquo;I wanna ring it!&rdquo; but turns out we&rsquo;d have to
reserve a spot in advance.</p>

<p>Seo and Mika gave us a bunch of mikans.  So delicious!</p>

<p>After we finished walking around the temple, it was about 12:45am, so
the Ikegami line was no longer running.  Mike and Seo walked home (not
too far), while Lin and I walked to Kamata station, and then home from
Kawasaki station.</p>

<p>I just got an email (that I opened!!) and noted it was sent to an
email address I entered on adobe.com</p>

<p>The content looks vaguely legit, but it starts to get spooky when
looking at the URL link (The TLD is .rocks)</p>

<p>Clicking that sends me to a sales website to get the latest doodads
from nothing related to Medicare.  Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think Adobe sold my
address to them.  I think Adobe got hacked.</p>

<p>Mikako and Seo came over today for なべ with me, Lin, and ママ.
Jennie is here in the living area; Ted is hiding in the cat room,
though he didn&rsquo;t totally panic when Lin and Mika went to visit him.</p>

<p>Seo and I are playing
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Popular-Playthings-HC70430-Say-Cheese/dp/B004QGW7GE">Say Cheese</a>.
I&rsquo;ve solved up through level 20 in the required number of moves; he
has done most of them except the pesky level 10.</p>

<p>##20:10</p>

<p>We are headed out to see Interstellar soon.</p>

<p>##1:17am Tuesday 30 December 2014 JST</p>

<p>Lin really liked the movie!  Seo liked it less than I expected.
Everyone was like, &ldquo;wait but, wait, what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the movie, we got to Kawasaki station at like 12:15am.  The last
train to their station had just left, but they were able to get
another train that went most of the way there.</p>

<p>Lin and I walked home and I tried to answer her questions ranging from
&ldquo;what is a black hole&rdquo; to &ldquo;why did one hour out there equal 7 years on
earth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>After my answers, I was glad Lin said, &ldquo;wow! I didn&rsquo;t know science was
so interesting!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the end of our walk, Lin wondered the why of life, and how the
universe started.  Good questions!</p>

<p>Lin and I went to Paola&rsquo;s for dinner with some cool peeps including
Jas, Rob, Rio, Ryo, and Tomoko.  Ryo and Tomoko brought their rabbit,
Nana; Rio brought a box of tissues.  Rob works with Jon who had to
work a bit during the evening.</p>

<p>Food, of course, was amazing, and I tried amaretto for the first
time.  Pretty yummy!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve wanted to see this movie ever since I was a little kid when it
first came out.  Tonight, we are watching it on Hulu.  (and by
watching, I mean I&rsquo;m watching, and Lin&rsquo;s taking a shower.  She&rsquo;ll
sleep on the couch soon after she gets back.)</p>

<p>##2:30</p>

<p>Well, it wasn&rsquo;t terrible, but it was definitely dated.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.jinni.com/movies/the-thing/reviews/">review on Jinni</a>
said</p>

<pre><code>It is certainly not boring, but it doesn't seem to add up to
much. Besides a few personality quirks, the characters are not
very clearly delineated, making it somewhat arbitrary who survives
in the end and difficult for us to even care.
</code></pre>

<p>Yup.</p>
