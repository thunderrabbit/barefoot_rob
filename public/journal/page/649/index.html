                        <p>Example Grant application for
YFUUD
Youth Funding for Unitarian Universalist Development</p>

<p><b>Name of local, district, continental, intercontinental, or lunar project:</b>
MUUN (Mission for UU Nation) Camp: The first YRUU colony on the moon<br />
(aka Y.U.R. In Space!!)</p>

<p><b>What is the expected total budget for your project?</b> $2.7 trillion</p>

<p><b>What amount are you requesting from the YRUU Program Fund?</b> $2500</p>

<p><b>If we cannot offer the full amount, would you want a partial amount?</b> Yes</p>

<p><b>What is the minimum amount you would accept?</b> $0.50</p>

<p><b>Who is the primary contact person(s) for your project?</b> Joe Kizonu</p>

<p><b>What is the general intent of your project?</b> To make a big
camp on the moon allowing youth from all over the planet to have
a &ldquo;get-away&rdquo; spot for chilling. This will encourage group
cooperation between future moon inhabitants. For the longer term,
we hope to incorporate MUUN Camp as a city and later as a nation.</p>

<p><b>Who will your project serve?</b>  Youth who wanted to be
astronauts as children but were laughed at.  Also will serve
youth who just want to live on the moon</p>

<p><b>Timeline for project during first year:</b></p>

<p>steps to achieve      person assigned     date due
* Find $2,699,999,997,500   Freg Garon
* Purchase a space shuttle. Dryan Deck      October 12, 1999
* Paint it cool colors      Panielle Dicard     October 25, 1999
* Load up sandwiches and
  building materials        Ken Bidder      November 10, 1999
* Fly to the moon       Sarah Pappastronaut November 15, 1999
* Build a colony        Captain SA Commander of the SC  December 30, 1999
* Party like it&rsquo;s 1999      Vivi LaMalley       December 31, 1999</p>

<p><b>Timeline for project after first year if applicable:</b>
  steps to achieve                  estimated date due
* Incorporate MUUN Camp as a city           mid 2000
* Secede from the earth as our own nation       late 2001</p>

<p><b>When and how do you plan to evaluate the progress of your project?</b></p>

<p>At the end of MUUN Camp, we&rsquo;ll ask each camper to return an evaluation.<br />
Within a week after the camp, MUUN Camp Council will meet to review the
evaluations from the campers and decide where we need to improve.   We expect
to begin proceedings for incorporating as a city by mid 2000 and to secede by
late 2001.</p>

<p><b>Please include a process by which YFUUD will be able to analyze the progress
of your project.</b>
A post-camp evaluation report including total project costs will be submitted to
YFUUD within a month after the first MUUN Camp ends.
Given this report,
YFUUD will know we used the money and that everyone had a great time.</p>

<p><b>Has this project been done by you or your group in the past?</b> No</p>

<p><b>If so, from where did you get your funding?</b> N/A</p>

<p><b>Will this be an ongoing event? (annual or otherwise?)</b><br />
MUUN Camp will occur every six months</p>

<p><b>If so, how will it be funded next time?</b>
Moon pies and astronaut ice cream sales at the camp will fund future start-up costs.</p>

<p class=date>9:30am Thursday 29 July 1999</p>

<p><p>Last night we worked our asses off on our resolution. I was up until 6am this morning helping work on it. The youth did most of the work; I worked on writing an example grant application with Chris and we really had a great funny time. We wrote a grant to fund a UU colony on the moon.</p>

<p><p>I slept through breakfast again. Here now before plenary Mandy is on a scavenger hunt for clues.  First clue was on her tablespace, leading her to a yellow plastic egg way up on a shelf thing which held a note: &ldquo;Not on Ceiling, Wall, nor Floor, but on the perimeter of this room.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>She looked around the piano a bit and then went toward the windows, &ldquo;it didn&rsquo;t say window, right?&rdquo; When people asked, she was all happily, &ldquo;my secret buddy is making me work!!&rdquo;  This is great!</p>

<p><p>I had a nice synchronicity this morning.  After having trouble getting my calling card to work in order to check my messages at home I ended up at a payphone in an obscure corner of the builing calling customer service of my calling card.  They weren&rsquo;t answering the phone so I mentally thought, &ldquo;5 seconds and I&rsquo;m hanging up.&rdquo; I gave them 10 seconds and hung up. At that moment, Mandy walked in. I was perfectly done with the phone and I got to watch her as she found her clues!  I love my perfectly synchronistic life!</p>

<p><p>What a great feeling!!!  The YFUUD resolution on which I spent many hours helping the youth write, passed unanimously!!!!  Thrilling!  Incerdible!!  Great work!!</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;ve been in plenary for hours now.  After an initial debate took way too long, the rest are going well and smoothly.  I power napped for a moment once in the break-out room next to plenary hall.  Zonked out in kneeling position with my forehead on the ground for about 5 minutes.  Much better!</p>

<p class=date>9pm Tuesday July 27 1999</p>

<p><p>Slept through breakfast and therefore missed the advisor meeting at 7:45am.  Oops.  I needed the sleep though.  Plenary was cool this morning; the at-larges (there are 4 youth at-large positions: 1 each to represent junior high, after high school (ages 19-20), social action, and Canada.  There are seven adult-at-large positions, of which I am one.) all introduced themselves and how they could be best used as resources. After the obvious youth related stuff, I told them computers and roller coasters.</p>

<p><p>During lunch our grant application working group met.  We have named ourselves YFUUD (pronouced &ldquo;why food&rdquo; (when we reach concensus we yell, &ldquo;why food&hellip; because!&rdquo;)), which stands for Youth Funding for UU Development.</p>

<p><p>Worship was creative and cool.  We decorated little medicine pouches.  I made a bead necklace (big colorful beads, short string so it looks kinda like a Marge Simpson necklace) for my secret buddy Mandy. I&rsquo;ve been sending her notes and hugs throughout the day.</p>

<p><p>Tonight is Blind Date Dance night.  We each got slips of paper saying where to meet our date, but no name was given.  To dress up for the date, I&rsquo;m wearing Fricke Fiesta scrubs, tie dyed Biff&rsquo;s Wonderful Clam Dip shirt and my new hat.</p>

<p><p><hr></p>

<p><p>1:00am Wednesday 28 July 1999</p>

<p><p>Dance was fun, Sarah Pappas as my &ldquo;date&rdquo;.  We played coy and it was funny funny, &ldquo;um, what do you want to do?  I dunno what do you want to do?&rdquo;  We danced all crazy and yeah.  DJ played White Rabbit by Airplane Crashers for me and closed with Simpsons opening sequence.  Funny.  Good night.</p>

<p class=date>7:45pm Monday 26 July 1999</p>

<p><p>At dinner I tried to eat 6 crackers in under 1 minute.  I was unable, but it was funny trying.  No others were able either.</p>

<p><p>After dinner we played Egyptian Rat Screw (a card game requiring fast reflexes) after check-in at touch group.  I found out that our touchgroup mascot (a plastic triceratops) had been hidden in the ceiling in Building A (my building) after the group had snuck out the fire escape from the kitchen of Building B (where our touch group met).</p>

<p><p>Workshops next.</p>

<p><p><hr></p>

<p><p>Wow.  Those weren&rsquo;t workshops, but Working Groups!  I had chosen LRY Grants thinking I&rsquo;ll learn how to apply for grants, but it turns out that we define how people can apply for grants to fund new YRUU projects! We brainstormed lots and will continue our work over lunch tomorrow. We began designing a subcommittee of Youth Council that will look over the applications each year and decide which ones to approve. A huge amount of thought has gone into just this process of developing the group, making sure all parties are equally represented and that no individual will have vested interest in a particular grant being reviewed.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m really proud of these youth!</p>

<p><p><hr align="left" width="20%"></p>

<p><p>11:43 pm Monday 26 July 1999</p>

<p><p>During worship we sang a chant: &ldquo;come and be one, become one, be one be,&rdquo; over and over.  Duncan sang something like &ldquo;Come Obi Wan, become one with Ghandi&rdquo; or something.  Pretty funny though not particularly worshipful maybe.  The version I made up in my head but did not sing was worse though: &ldquo;run Bambi run, I&rsquo;m gonna shoot your mommy.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Sometimes I don&rsquo;t know why I think of these things.</p>

<p><p>After the worship was finished, we sang Madonna&rsquo;s &ldquo;Like a Prayer&rdquo; with great enthusiasm!</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ve been tired today; I&rsquo;m going to bed.</p>

<p><p><hr></p>

<p><p>Nope not to bed.  I went downstairs after the entry to say goodnight, and the response was, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s play Silent Football!&rdquo;  They even asked me to be dictator, so it will be a Southwest District Rules version of the game.</p>

<p><p>2am  Fun game hopelessly crazy; 20 or more people.  Chris forfeited the game trying to form a coup to overthrow the dictator. His penance is that he has to use his body to form the digits of numbers in his YRUU budget report to plenary.</p>

<p><p>Eroca aquired the name &ldquo;Ms Hairball Farm Mistress&rdquo; or something and Austin ended up being called &ldquo;Orangutang Muppet&rdquo; for his boistrous laughter in response to Eroca&rsquo;s farm-animal-sounding laughter.  Super funny game!</p>

<p class=date>early am Sunday 25 July 1999</p>

<p><p>Talked to Bryan last night joking lots about Southpark movie.  He knows lots of the songs from the soundtrack and lots of lines from the movie. &ldquo;Mom, there&rsquo;s someone at the door.  Mom!  I said there&rsquo;s someone at the door!  Hey, I can&rsquo;t see the TV!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Duncan came in a bragged that his group had kidnapped 3 of the 6 touch group mascots, different plastic dinosaurs.  He vowed to have all of them by the end of the week.</p>

<p><p>I was a tad nervous coming into breakfast this morning; I hadn&rsquo;t been part of any of the opening circles or whatever last night, so I&rsquo;d be coming into the group essentially cold.  Of course it was no problem though; I just got in my &ldquo;HI&rdquo; mood and bounced into breakfast.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m learning names of the youth pretty quickly.</p>

<p><p><hr align="left" width="20%"></p>

<p><p>First day of plenary is over and I&rsquo;m inspired.  We talked about a vision for an ultimate YRUU, including Intercontinental Conference, and I later joined a working group that began a resolution on Outreach.  We sketched out a technique by which we could link up UU pen pals in various countries.</p>

<p><p><hr align="left" width="20%"></p>

<p><p>Played dry fish hand fwapping game at our touch group meeting and that was fun.  Later a game of Fruit was suggested.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fruit:

<p>Arrange a group of people in a circle.  Each person thinks of a unique name of a fruit -- apple, banana, orange, grape, etc.

<p>One person is chosen to be It, who stands in the center of the circle.  One person in the circle begins by saying their fruit name "loves" another person's fruit name.  It tries to tag the second person before they can say their fruit name "loves" another person's fruit name.

<p>"Apple loves grape"
<br>"grape loves strawberry"
<br>"strawberry loves banana"
<br>"Banana loves um, ..."  and Banana is tagged before finishing the sentence so Banana takes It's place, and It takes Banana's place and begins a new round using It's original fruit name.

<p>(note on grammar: In the preceding paragraph I used "It's" to mean the possessive form of It.  I recognize the correct possessive form of "it" is "its."  I added the apostrophe because I used "It" as a proper noun.)
</blockquote>

<p><p>We decided to play this game, but couldn&rsquo;t decide what version to play.  Fruit, Elements, or Animals, so we combined all three, plus added a rule that people could make up their own elements.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Apple love Phosphorous&rdquo;
<br>&ldquo;Phosphorous loves Sexium&rdquo;
<br>&ldquo;Sexium loves Kangaroo&rdquo;
<br>&ldquo;Kangaroo loves Whos-your-daddium&rdquo;
<br>&ldquo;Whos-your-daddium loves Swisherbeast&rdquo;
<br>&ldquo;Swisherbeast loves Kumquat&rdquo;
<br>&hellip;..</p>

<p><p>So much more funny!</p>

<p><p><hr align="left" width="20%"></p>

<p><p>We played Capture The Flag with waterlogged squishy foam balls to tag people and I ended up in jail pretty quickly in the game.  Big fun with lots of good natured cheating and no real winner declared.  We mostly ran around trying to get people wet.</p>

<p><p>Budget discussion in the evening plenary session resulted in Youth Council voting No to the adult-suggested budget for YRUU.  Normally Youth Council does a &ldquo;rubberstamp&rdquo; yes to whatever is suggested.  This is the first time in 17 years that this budget has been rejected.  A working group will be created to clearly state our reasons for rejecting it and the amounts we request.</p>

<p><p>Yay!  Go Youth Council!</p>

<p><p>12:45am Monday 26 July 1999</p>

<p><p>Worship tonight was great and experimental.  Outside in a circle chanting quietly slowly turned to singing, clapping, beatboxing crazy fun!  Total love, total wow, total acceptance of all forms of performance.  Nice.</p>

<p><p>We had placed sleeping bags on the ground and mine ended up with a significant amount of sap on it. Sticky.</p>

<p><p>I used Dr Bronner&rsquo;s to allow the sap out.</p>

<p><p><hr align="left" width="20%"></p>

<p><p>1:53 am.  Talked with Tera my wonderful advisor friend who is following her heart and dream to California.  I&rsquo;m envious and inspired by her vision.  She told me about some paid advisor positions that are now or are becoming available.  Awesome!</p>

<p><p>She also invited me to Winter Camp in her new California district!</p>

<p class=date>11:15am Saturday 24 July 1999</p>

<p><p>Oh my gosh.</p>

<p><p>Packed last night and finished up this morning and Wende drove me to the airport.  Dropped me off in plenty of time and I went in and the line for American was suuper long!!  Stood there for a minute but it wasn&rsquo;t moving so I decided to go straight to the gate.  Found the monitor for departures and could not find my flight.  Check my flight coupon.</p>

<p><p>Oh god.  Wrong airport.  I was at Intercontinental (IAH), and had to be at Hobby (HOU) in like 40 minutes.  It&rsquo;s way further than that away.</p>

<p><p>Thought about just getting a cab but I really wanted to cry and didn&rsquo;t feel comfortable doing that in front (or behind) of a stranger.  Called Wende.  Bless her heart she drove back and got me and drove over the curb to the next lane to get out of the airport faster.  I cried for a second then I could think more straightly.  Wende did most of the good thinking though.  First off, we were low on gas.  She offered to just try to drive all the way, but I encouraged her to get a little bit so we could for sure make it.</p>

<p><p>I called American Airlines and it took <em>forever</em> to get to talk to a person.  Finally someone answered and I was all, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m about to miss my flight; can you help?&rdquo;  I explained the situation: My goal was to get from Houston to Des Moines today.  I had a connecting flight out of Dallas at 1:30pm.  AA had another flight out of IAH, but it was delayed until 12:45; no way to make it to Dallas on time.  They had nothing out of HOU, but encouraged me to go there since my original flight was from HOU.</p>

<p><p>Called Southwest Airlines.  A person picked up on the first ring. They had a flight out of HOU into Dallas Love at 11:30 for $89.  Fully refundable if I make my other flight.  Great.  I gave her my name and she began to make the reservation. Then suddenly <em>click</em> My phone disconnected.  Aw crap.</p>

<p><p>Called back.  A different person picked up on the first ring.  &ldquo;Hi I just called but got disconnected,&rdquo; &ldquo;what were you trying to do?&rdquo;  I gave my name and she found my reservation.  I was about to give my credit card information when, <em>click</em>.</p>

<p><p>Grrrrr.  Called back.  A different person answered on the first ring.  Explained everything and this time we did it.  Got a reservation for flight 22 leave HOU 11:30 to LUV at 12:20 and was on standby for flight 20 11:00 to 11:50.</p>

<p><p>Once I had the ticket, Wende and I pondered my luggage situation. I had 3 bags and usually can only carry-on 2.  I trusted that they would just let me do it.  Wende suggested that if not, I could maybe ask American to check my bag all the way through to Des Moines so it would just get there the next day. Hmmm.</p>

<p><p>Got to the airport and walked toward terminal A.  Going through the security check thing the lady was polite but said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll need to check that bag.&rdquo;  Oh please no.  My bag wouldn&rsquo;t fit in the &ldquo;your bag must be checked if it won&rsquo;t fit in this box&rdquo; slot, so I unzipped one end of the bag and put it inside my other bag.  She said that should work.  I was all, &ldquo;see I can&rsquo;t check my bags because I&rsquo;m trying to make a connecting flight in Dallas.  If I check them, I won&rsquo;t make it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re going to Dallas?  You&rsquo;re in the wrong terminal.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Oh no.</p>

<p><p>Her thought was confirmed, so I headed toward terminal C.</p>

<p><p>I did not look forward to going through another security thing. They didn&rsquo;t stop me though, so I zipped straight to the gate for flight 20. Explained that I was on standby for the flight and the woman was all, &ldquo;oh yes there is plenty of room on this flight.&rdquo;  I began to explain my luggage situation but she interrupted, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry; just get on; we&rsquo;re leaving in 3 minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Down the jetway I ran and the guy took my boarding pass. (Number 61 for those keeping track; it was a small flight.)  He was all, &ldquo;would you like to check that?&rdquo;  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really want to, but I can&rdquo;  &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re trying to catch a flight?  No problem.&rdquo;  (I didn&rsquo;t mind in this case; since I made the earlier flight, I&rsquo;d have plenty of time in Dallas to get my bags.) Got on and the stewardess helped me stuff my bags in the overhead bin.  Made it.  Called Wende on my cell phone during the several seconds before they shut the door and we left.  Thank you thank you.</p>

<p><p>That is how I made my flight.</p>

<p class=date>1:46 pm Saturday 24 July 1999</p>

<p><p>Got to Dallas Love and ran, following the signs to American Airlines.  Walked down a tunnel thing, up a ramp thing, back down a thing and suddenly didn&rsquo;t see any more signs for American.  Crap.  Back up the thing and back down and asked someone.  Turns out I had been going the correct way in the first place.  This sure wasn&rsquo;t well marked.</p>

<p><p>Around a corner, through a security gate, up a small escalator, finally to the American counter.  Presented my ticket, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to get to Des Moines.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry; you&rsquo;re at the wrong airport.  We only have flights to Austin.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Fuck.</p>

<p><p>I slumped.  Okay, where do I need to go?</p>

<p><p>The guy was pretty pessimistic about me making the flight; I only had 30 minutes to get there.  But I had to go for it.  Back down the little escalator, where the security guys were all, &ldquo;? huh ?&rdquo; and I told them the situation.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You might be able to make it if you grab a cab,&rdquo; they offered, plus, &ldquo;good luck!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Trudged back up the hill, down the hill and let me promise you my bags weighed a million pounds.  No wheels, no shoulder straps.</p>

<p><p>Out toward Passenger Pick Up and found the cabs were not availble there, but somewhat further down the sidewalk.  A baggage handler offered to drive me there in his cart.  So very appreciative I was and tipped him a dollar once my bags were in the trunk of the cab.</p>

<p><p>Told the cabbie my plight and he drove 75 or 80 miles per hour toward the other airport.</p>

<p><p>Unfortunately I didn&rsquo;t know what gate, and my bags were inaccessible in the trunk. I considered calling American on the phone, but they hadn&rsquo;t been able to give me gate information previously, so I didn&rsquo;t try this time.  I knew the second flight to Des Moines left from Gate C 26; the guy at Dallas Love had told me that.  So I assumed Gate C for the earlier flight I was trying to catch.</p>

<p><p>Tipped the cabbie 5 bucks for a total of $30.  Hauled my bags back out of the trunk, and hauled up to the monitors.  Found an American Airlines desk before I found a monitor.  Wrong terminal.  My flight was leaving in several minutes from gate A18.</p>

<p><p>My shoulders and hands were killing me, but I ran, hoping to find someone driving an electric cart.  I couldn&rsquo;t run more than 50 yards, and had to settle for a fast walk.  Fortunately they had moving sidewalks which helped some, but my arms were still burning.  Finally I found an electric cart willing to go my direction.  He was on break eating fries and a shake, but said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I had made it to A26 from C26 in DFW.  I&rsquo;m not sure how far that is, but it&rsquo;s pretty far.  To A18 we drove, zipping around people and stuff.  Got to the gate.  Missed my flight.</p>

<p><p>Now I really wanted to cry. Instead, I payed the electric cart guy 2 bucks and he drove me to gate C34, from which the later flight would leave.  I couldn&rsquo;t believe how far I had walked!  I confirmed the flight information and called the Youth Council emergency number to let them know.</p>

<p><p>In review: verify flight information before leaving.</p>

<p><p>That is how I missed my flight.</p>

                        <p class=date>8:22pm Friday 23 July 1999</p>

<p><p>In 12 hours I leave for 2 weeks in Iowa.  I haven&rsquo;t packed yet.  The first week I&rsquo;ll be an adult-at-large on Youth Council, and the second week I&rsquo;ll be an advisor at Con Con.  Each of these events are youth empowering, youth organized, youth everything, and I&rsquo;m proud to be a part of the wonderfulness.</p>

<p><p>I do not have a laptop yet (haven&rsquo;t had the proper cashflow for one) so I may write a mega entry at the end of it all, but maybe will figure out a way to write while I&rsquo;m there.</p>

<p><p>My pictures were not selected for show in The Big Show at Lawndale Art Center.  I picked them up today and I&rsquo;ll put them on my wall here in my apartment where they are loved and appreciated!</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ll be sending 10 slides out to another art show thing in San Antonio; I&rsquo;ll let you know how that goes.</p>

<p><p>So my big overall thought these days is something like, &ldquo;how are you going to pay for Australia?&rdquo;  This question is subtitled &ldquo;are the prices my travel agent quoted still available?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>To this end, I think I am ready to fully kick into gear my Flashnet sales and may look for a job as soon as I get back from Iowa.  Weird thing is that after Flashmania in Dallas, I kicked booty talking up Flashnet and now I&rsquo;m out of town for two weeks so I can&rsquo;t really do it.  I hope and expect my excitement will still be up when I get back.</p>

<p><p><hr align="left" width="20%"></p>

<p><p>Now i am packed.  It&rsquo;s 11:50pm.  Even went with Wende to Target to get little gifts for our Secret Buddies.  :-)   I got a small trout shaped flashlight (&ldquo;it&rsquo;s not a flashlight; it&rsquo;s a fishlight!&rdquo;  &ldquo;it&rsquo;s so dark in here!&rdquo; - &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry, I have my fish!&rdquo;)  Also grabbed a glostick, and something else but I forgot what.</p>

<p><p>I got a dark green Gilligan hat for myself.  I like it.</p>

<p><p>So there you go. I&rsquo;ll be gone for two weeks and I&rsquo;ll have a super incredible time.  No telling what or how much I&rsquo;ll write when I get back; I know how my track record has been..</p>

<p><p>Have a great two weeks yourself!!</p>

<p><p>With Love
<br>- Rob</p>

<p><p>I entered 3 pictures into The Big Show, an annual art show here in Houston.  I don&rsquo;t know if they have been accepted yet; I&rsquo;ll find out by Friday.</p>

<p><p>On this coming Saturday, I&rsquo;m going out of town for 2 weeks.  Both weeks will be in Iowa for <a href="https://www.yruu.org">YRUU</a> stuff.  First week is for Youth Council, like the US Senate, except for YRUU.  Second week is for Con Con, a week long conference for youth, same as Con Con last year, except in Iowa.  (it moves each year)</p>

<p><p>Over the past couple of days, I&rsquo;ve been working on a project for another art show&hellip; it&rsquo;s seemed like a project:  I&rsquo;m having slides developed out of prints that I&rsquo;ve already taken.  The slides are needed to enter this next art show, and are due on August 4.  A quick look at my calendar and I realize I am quickly running out of time, since I&rsquo;ll be out of town past August 4th starting in 2 days.  Yikes!</p>

<p><p>Special thanks to Laura and the crew at <a href="https://www.wolfcamera.com">Wolf Camera</a> for their help.</p>

<p><p>Speaking more about pictures, my friend Jennifer has offered to scan some pictures for me since I obviously haven&rsquo;t in a while.  I wasn&rsquo;t able to get my scanner to work on my Windows machine in a while, and haven&rsquo;t found linux drivers for the scanner.   If you know where I can get linux drivers for a Microtek ScanMaker E3 Plus, please <a href="mailto:robnugen@flash.net">let me know!</a></p>

<p><p>Speaking of linux, I met a dude named Jeffrey yesterday who also has linux on his PC, and even has a 50 megabit connection to the internet. Whoah!!  I met him yesterday at the laundry mat and it turns out we both know Cathy Crawford, an independent Flashnet representative like me!</p>

<p><p>Speaking of Flashnet, I have been handing out way more business cards lately than before (previously I&rsquo;d been handing out almost none) and surprise my sales appear to be going up!  I even gave my card to some cops downtown while I was skating!</p>

<p><p>Speaking of skating, I found a group who skates consistently twice a week!  Like 15 or 20 miles per night!  Oh so so so exciting and they actually meet only 2 blocks from my apartment, so I can just skate over and join them.  Truue!!!!!</p>

<p><p>Speaking of truue, today I&rsquo;ll be at KTRU from 1-4, covering Robert&rsquo;s shift.  Right now I&rsquo;m meeting Robin for lunch and then KTRU then pictures to Jennifer to scan, then Flashnet meeting tonight.  Big fun all day!</p>

<p><p>Oh, more about KTRU..  when I was there on Tuesday, near the end of my shift, kT came to see me!  She&rsquo;s one of my local youth.  She was all silly smiley and announced, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got worms!&rdquo;  referring, of course to the gummy worms she had as a snack.  We laughed and ate worms and played &ldquo;The Bumble Bee Tuna Song&rdquo;  Big fun.  Yay!</p>

<p><p>ps: I just got an <a href="/web_stuff/funny_classics/destroy_earth.html">article</a> that I think makes an interesting statement on our state of technology.</p>
