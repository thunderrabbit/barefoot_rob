what's up with that?</p>

<br>Northeast Struggles As Power Returns <br>
<br>
By LARRY McSHANE, Associated Press Writer <br>
<br>
Appliances crackled back to life and light bulbs again blazed across most of the Northeast following the worst blackout in U.S. history, though getting electricity back didn&rsquo;t help those in Cleveland enjoy clean tap water or allow New Yorkers to ride their beloved subway. <br>
<br>
The lingering effects of Thursday&rsquo;s dramatic power outage stretched into Saturday as millions struggled with both the mundane — resetting VCR clocks — to the life-threatening — boiling tap to ensure potability. <br>
<br>
Some customers in the Cleveland area, upstate New York and New York City received the unkindest cut of all: Their power was restored and then promptly turned off due to rolling blackouts needed to conserve electricity. <br>
<br>
Officials in Michigan warned that the whir of air conditioners and the glow of televisions might not return until the end of the weekend as the cause of the massive outage remained a mystery. <br>
<br>
About 50 members of the National Guard helped distribute 7,600 gallons of drinking water in Cleveland. Residents of Cleveland and Detroit, battling low pressure, were told to boil water before drinking or cooking with it. <br>
<br>
Canada and the United States formed a joint task force Friday to investigate what caused the blackout — which knocked out service in parts of eight states and Canada in just nine seconds — and how to prevent it from happening again. <br>
<br>
While New Yorkers and virtually all the 1.4 million Ohioans who lost power were back on line, about 50,000 customers in Michigan were still in the dark early Saturday.<br>
<br>
The failure of electric pumps led to a run on gasoline and Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm signed an executive order to expedite nearly 1 million gallons of gasoline from western Michigan to the Detroit area. <br>
<br>
In Connecticut, residents heard an emergency plea from the governor to cut back on power use after a state transmission line that feeds the southwest part of the state failed early Friday. <br>
<br>
The call for conservation echoed across each state affected by the blackout. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t turn them off, they will go off,&rdquo; said Long Island Power Authority Chairman Richard Kessel. <br>
<br>
Chris Bowen, 47, of Syracuse, N.Y., said he and his family would try to heed the plea. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll probably leave the air conditioner off tonight when we go to sleep. We played cards by candlelight last night and it was fun. Maybe we&rsquo;ll do that again.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
President Bush (news - web sites), during a tour of a California national park, said part of the problem was &ldquo;an antiquated system&rdquo; to distribute electricity nationally. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wake-up call,&rdquo; he said. <br>
<br>
In New York City, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said he received a call from Bush offering congratulations on the city&rsquo;s handling of the crisis. Crime in the city was actually down compared to an average evening, he said. <br>
<br>
&ldquo;I think all New Yorkers have done their part,&rdquo; Bloomberg said. <br>
<br>
The New York City Council finance office estimated the blackout cost the city up to $750 million in lost revenue — up to $40 million in lost tax revenue and up to $10 million in overtime pay for the first 24 hours. <br>
<br>
The city&rsquo;s subway system, the nation&rsquo;s largest, began moving after midnight, and by dawn trains on all lines were running with minor disruptions. <br>
<br>
Despite plunging several of the nation&rsquo;s largest cities into darkness, the outage resulted in few reports of vandalism or increased violence. There were at least three U.S. fatalities. <br>
    <br>
In New York fires, a 6-year-old was killed and a 40-year-old man suffered a heart attack. A 42-year-old woman in Connecticut died in a blaze sparked by a candle. Her husband and 10-year-old son were badly burned. <br>
<br>
In Canada&rsquo;s capital of Ottawa, police reported 23 cases of looting, along with two deaths possibly linked to the blackout — a pedestrian hit by a car and a fire victim. <br>
<br>
More than 50 assembly and other plants in Canada, Ohio and Michigan operated by General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG&rsquo;s Chrysler Group were affected, leaving tens of thousands of workers idle. <br>
<br>
The restored power also left people wondering whether meat in the now-warm freezer was still good. &ldquo;The sniff test is probably the most effective. When in doubt, throw it out,&rdquo; said Tom Heinen, co-owner of a chain of 15 Ohio supermarkets. <br>
<br>
As for the cause of the outage, which happened almost instantaneously across the Northeast at 4:11 p.m. EDT Thursday, officials remained in the dark. <br>
<br>
Investigators focused on a massive electrical grid that encircles Lake Erie, moving power from New York to the Detroit area, Canada and back to New York state. There had been problems with the transmission loop in the past, officials said. <br>
<br>
A young Connecticut couple, meanwhile, was enjoying an addition to their family. They made their way through chaotic streets Thursday to Greenwich Hospital to have their first baby. <br>
<br>
The hospital managed the delivery with the help of generators. <br>
<br>
&ldquo;Everyone keeps saying you&rsquo;ll remember where you were on the outage of 2003,&rdquo; said Dan O&rsquo;Neill, whose wife, Kara, gave birth to a healthy baby boy early Friday morning. &ldquo;It was a blackout and he has one of the blackest heads of hair I&rsquo;ve ever seen.&rdquo; <br>

<p>Yesterday Yukiji helped me get to a travel agency, but I still
don't really feel like I can get all my connections connected for my
trip to Osaka et. al. with janette.</p>

<p>I got pissed off today when Rich came in and was all, "HI.  A
little piece of advice, don't say the book is wrong; I wasted five
minutes of my lesson correcting a student on an error you made
yesterday."</p>

<p>I silently crushed my aluminum drink bottle as he spoke to me.
"hmf."</p>

<p>Several minutes later I was like, "okay," and gave my opinion:</p>

<table border=1><tr><td>
<p>"My name is Rob."</p>

<p>"What did he say?"</p>

<p>"He said his name was Rob."</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>That's ridiculous, but it's what the book says should be spoken in
that situation.  Fuck that.  My name is still Rob, so the last line
oughta be "He said his name is Rob."</p>

<p>Carla agrees with me that's it's dumb (the book), but what's SUPER
dumb is telling the students that this fucked up book is the all high
and mighty fucking bible of English.  It's a shit book.</p>

<p>"We have enough trouble getting the students to use the book as it
is, so don't tell them it's wrong."</p>

<p>At first I was like, <em>I will</em> never <em>concede this
point</em>, but then I talked to Phil who suggested that the book is
simplifying the language for the students.   So I don't have to say
that it's wrong, but it's being simplified.  And he showed me a page
in his (thicker) book that showed the nuances.  You rock, Phil.</p>

<p>I copied the page and I'll use it as my guide to augment the FUCKED
UP (oops) book if I get to that lesson again.</p>

<p>Fujiyama, the King of Coasters, is really sweet.  We rode it 3
times and I liked it more and more each time I rode it.</p>

<p>The coaster offers like  7 seconds of total freefall time for the
back car and does the final close-to-the-ground curve to go back to
the beginning REALLY fast. Why? Cause IT'S NOT OVER!   3 more crazy
shake-a-brain humps back and forth like a skater in a halfpipe and
then it's over WHOAH no it's not!  one more crazy hump and Wow.  NOW
it's over - What a ride!!</p>

<p>That coaster is basically worth the trip to FkH, if one is already
in Tokyo.</p>

<p>Money.</p>

<p>(Why did I pick that up from Frank?)</p>

<p>Met with Lucy at Gateway 21 in Shinjuku.   It sounds like a sweet
setup.  Gateway 21 is actually a travel agency with a side business of
hooking up Japanese travelers with native speakers of the language
spoken in the country where the Japanese are planning to visit.
(How's that for a flocked up sentence?)</p>

<p>So, Lucy will contact me...  hey I never gave her my phone number
or email address; how strange is that?  hold please.</p>

<p>Ah fuckit.  I gave her my resume online and my email address is
there.</p>

<p>Anyway, she will contact me a week or two in advance and be all "yo
yo yo can you teach on Tuesday the __ at Npm?"  And I'll be all,
"heayeah; hook a brotha up!"   And then I meet with a student and have
a lesson in Gateway 21's office in Shinjuku and every month I get paid
2500 yen for every lesson I've taught.  And the student pays for my
transportation so I can get a teiki from my crib to Shinjuku and that
puts hella awesome stations on my free transit list.  Shibuya (for
hanging out with anyone who meets at Hachiko) and Shinjuku (largest
station in the world).  I was thinking it hooks me up with Shinagawa,
but it doesn't.  Ah well.</p>

<p>Speaking of Shinagwa, I'm arriving there now to zoom to Kawasaki to
meet with Yukiji at 6pm.</p>

<p>I seem to be stuck; I want some cheerleading.  I've called janette
three times in the past 12 hours with no response and I'm like wtf did
I get fired again?  I don't know what I could have done.  I called
Wende this morning and left a message.  Maybe I'll call Maggie, but I
don't want to whine to her while she's at work.</p>

<p>I called Mags at home and left a message.</p>

<p class=date>11:02am</p>

<p>Okay.  Fuck this.  I persevere.  I'm getting up and getting on with
my day.</p>

<br>
i wanted to talk to you sooo badly today. i was taking jack to take a test when you called the first two times.   i did not want to wake you last nite and then i had to restrain myself to not call you this morning for fear i was calling too early. geeesh <br>
 i can hardly wait to be in the same time zone with you.<br>
  <br>
  i will let you know loud and clear if i aim to fire you.<br>
it sure as hell won&rsquo;t be in the next 44 days!  (unless  you reeeeeeaaaaaally piss me off). don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t<br>

<p>But I really wanted to just walk through the glass door instead of
having it open for me.  Like "oh yeah?  You wanna not speak English
and not let me change this ticket?  When the receipt says plainly I
can change it up to three days after purchase?  yeah?  Well"
&lt;ppshhhhhh> "there goes your precious glass door."</p>

<p>((How do those doors work anyway?  I mean duh, it's a door, but
they open automatically when I press a button on the door.  But it's a
glass door, and there is no visible connection from the button to the
door opener.  So it must send a radio signal to the opener, right?  So
each door has its own radio code to say, "hey you, open now." Very
interesting.))</p>

<p>So the door didn't shatter although I pressed the button really
hard, not like [bang!] hitting the button, but like
[prreeeeeessssssss] really slowly and hard.  And it opened without
shattering.</p>

<p>Good thing; I might have gotten glass in my hair.</p>

<p>So what am i mad about?  Just that I don't know Japanese, or that I
couldn't communicate with this cat quickly enough (several people in
line behind me (though *I* had waited long enough)) and explain to him
that he's a dingaling and my receipt says I can change it, but I don't
have time right now cause I'm hungry and need to eat and then go to
Shinjuku to get a cool job that doesn't suck and blah blah blah
blah.</p>

<p>Blah.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Bought food on the way home, ate, sent an email to Wende and the
realized I better geo right away cause I don't know exactly where I'm
going and Shinjuku is a monster of a train station.  Largest in the
world, I've heard.</p>

<p>I wore leather shoes, slacks, shirt and tie for my meeting with
Lucy. I wanted to change clothes, but didn't want to go through Nova
to a restroom in our building, but that was the closest restroom to
Keikyu station where I was to meet Yukiki.  I tried to find a back way
to the restroom, and ended up just changing in a deserted stairwell in
the recesses of the building.  Awesome.</p>

<p>Met Yukiji just after 6pm and we walked to a family restaurant
nearby.  Japanese family restaurant.   Awesome.</p>

<p>Er, make that Denny's, Japanese style.  Not like fuckin' take off
yer shoes Japanese style, but hand out hot cloths before eating and
serve all kindsa crazy Japanese food instead of American favs.</p>

<p>Showed Yukiji the pics on my computer, zinging through all 1880 of
them in about 20 minutes after she aksed to see pics of my
girlfriend.</p>

<p>She gave me some Pera Pera Penguin pages to help with my Japanese,
and she hopefully learned a bit of English as well.</p>

<p>I'm thrilled that she's going to help me tomorrow, making
reservations for me-an-Janette's trip to Kyoto, Osaka, Nara,
Hakone.</p>

<p>I just got an email from Bill Phillips who said he heard a
disturbing story about me.  Without telling me what the story was, he
asked me to tell him it wasn't true.  I wonder what story he heard.  I
told him the worst of my YRUU stories.</p>

<p class=dream>Getting ready to go to gymnastics, I was back at my
dad's house in my old room, but like back there again (now) not in the
past and I had grabbed a soft t-shirt, but it was long sleeved, and I
grabbed a short sleeve shirt that flaired at the bottom but it was all
itchy, so I put on a t-shirt underneath it and then put on the
flair-ey soccer shirt with holes in it and then put on a 'mask' of
plastic fishnet material over my face as a mokc way to hide my face.
There were two Bill Cosby LPs on my reord player and I had left them
out and made a mental note to clean them up some day soon.Right after
I get back from gymnastics maybe.</p>

<p>I am choosing not to take my computer to Fujikyu Highland today.
Part of me has placed upon this adventure the need-to-be-perfect and
therefore wracked my brain plenty in deciding whether or not to take
my computer:</p>

<p>It could be stolen while I'm on the rides (breaking away from my
uber-trust of Japanese).  It would get heavy carrying it around all
day.  I can focus on Japanese learnin' with Nami without it.  I can
write emails while I'm waiting for Nami at Noburrito.  I mean
Noborito.</p>

<p>Then I came to: this trip is not my last adventure to FkH.  It's
not imperative that it be perfect.  Just.. fuckin', whatever dude.
's'coo, bro.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>leaving now.</p>
