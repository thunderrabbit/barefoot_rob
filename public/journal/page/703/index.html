<p>I don't know why I woke up early.  I got a letter from Shay
Pickerell yesterday.  It was short but nice.  She hasn't been to
church since I met her at the OKC Rally.  Kelly has not written to me
yet.  I will write to her and give her the details on the Houston
Rally.  Church today will be fun. We are having a pic-nic.  I hope we
can grab that room.  I will bring my Spuds Mackenzie poster for it.
We will need to put a bulliten board in there and a whole bunch of
pillows.  A stero is needed, too.  Well, that's about all.  Good
Morning 6:50AM</p>

<p>We had no meeting yesterday.  It will be Tuesday.  I need to
practice rifles more than I have been.  I need to bring a poster on
something for the NUTS Room.  Spuds Mackenzie probably.  I want a
whole lot of pillows for that room.  It will be great. Bryn wrote me a
letter, but it was very short and she didn't put our usual pictures at
the end.  I'm finding it hard to write back properly.  OH Well.  Good
night.  I want Lucid Dreams 10:35</p>

<p>Mrs. Sherman liked the movie.  I finished my Algebra II final
except for the parabola.  Rob and Neil stayed up all night working.
Literally. They slept all day until 6th period (Algebra) when they
came to school.  Tomorrow I have a meeting to go to for rifles.  We
will get measured for our outfits.  I talked to Heather Lakatos some
in Algebra today. I also gave her a shoulder/back massage.  She said
she liked it. I hope she will let me give her more.  Today in
gymnastics, I did 2 flyaways.  On my next try, I hit the bar with my
foot.  It hurts a little Still.  The NUTS get to have our own room in
church.  That will be great.  Though it has no windows.  We will paint
some maybe.  I can't wait.  Well, Goodnight 11:00. PM</p>

<p>We did it.  We did a movie about RAMBO.  Robert Astle was Rambo.  I
was the chief bad guy.  Neil and Dean were my helpers.  Mary Beth was
Ramba.  Tammie Pekar was another damsel in distress.  OK the base
plot: Mary B and Tammie were with Rambo.  He left for a second and the
bad guys grabbed the girls.  Rambo came back and found out.  He went
after the bad guys.  They were in their hide out playing cards.  I
came in and shot the girls. (they were in there) We played cards and
then Saw Rambo.  As we ran out I dumped over the card table, hard.
Next scene - Rambo comes up to the bad guys.  I come flying in doing a
flip off a trampoline onto the ground.  We all fight and I get out of
the scene.  The 2 guys get Rambo down.  Ramba comes in and knocks them
out 1 punch each.  She carried Rambo off.  She came back and killed
the 2 bad guys and they fell in a pool.  In the last scene I was
Rambo/Ramba's servant.  It was cool.  I hope Mrs. Sherman likes it.
good Night 11:20PM</p>

<p class=note>[I can still remember to this day (my 12,000th!) as we
were in Mr Reagh's Algebra II class (I remember it was Mr Reagh's
room, but I wouldn't have remembered the subject without reading my
diary), near the end of the day, announcements were made that anyone
who wanted to try out for marching band should go to the band room
that afternoon right after school. After a bit of discussion with
Heather Lakatos and maybe Derrick Whitte, Christi Bradley turned
around in her desk, looked deeply into my soul with her beautiful blue
eyes and said, "you should join band."</p>

<p class=note>Me, like a deer in headlights: "okay."]</p>

<p class=date>10:20 May 13.</p>

<p>Christi Bradley got me to try out for rifles today, and I made it.
OH Shit.  That will be a lot of work.  But I'm in band, now, and I'm
near Lynda Smith.  She's in rifles, too.  Sex Sex Sex.  I will get to
go to 6-flags if I keep it up.  I will have to practice every fucking
day, though.  Goodnight 10:22</p>

<p>Gary made a Magna-Carta.  I bought one and put bleach on it and
folded it just right.  Mine was 100% better.  Mrs Roach thought they
were cool.  I ended up going to see it with dad on Sunday.  Ginger
didn't see it.  Lanette didn't see it.</p>

<p>I just finished Bryn's Letter.  I am thinking about quitting
gymnastics.  As of now, I have only told Brian.  He said he would quit
if I did.  I also don't want to quit because I would have to get
another job.  I don't want to work.  I just want Girls all day.  I
want sex.  We had locker cleanout today.  My locker was already
perfectly clean.  I didn't do anything to it.  Tomorrrow I am planning
to see a copy of the Magna Carta.  Ginger Przybyla is going to take
me.  I am supposed to call her tonight.  I will as soon as I finish
this.  I have been trying a lot.  I reached Tammie Pekar when Ginger
was in the shower.  I guess Tammie is going with us.  That will be
fun.  Ginger is supposed to call me back, but it has been 30 mins.
Today when Mrs Roach told us the Magna Carta would be in Houston, she
said we would each get a 100 replacing our lowest grade if we go see
it.  Gary Crawford said, "how much if we bring it back?"  Mrs Roach
went crazy for a bit.  Telling him No don't do that.  Gary and I are
going to make a copy of it instead.  On an old grocery sack or
something.  We are going to put it on her desk under a fish tank
courtesy Mr Roesler.  It will be hilarious.  Today after school, I was
trying to get Mrs Roache's poster of the Magna Carta so we could copy
it.  But she woudn't leave.  She stayed by her room until at least
3:30.  I finally left and didn't worry about it.  Good Night 11:02</p>

<p>I wrote to Cheri.  I told her she was hard to flirt with.  I wonder
if I should send it.  I wonder how she'll take it.  Me, Rob Astle,
Neil Henthorne, & Dean Chandler may make a movie for Spanish extra

<p>Candie Downy knows the dude who recorded "I be Elliot" for 93Q.  I
may have a chance to meet the dude.  He is totally cool and a real
good friend from what I have heard from Candie.  I'm thinking about
quitting gymnastics.  I don't have the interest like I used to.  Bryan
said if I quit, he would too.  I wonder how bad that would be for Jim?
I don't know.  12:07AM May 6 1987</p>
