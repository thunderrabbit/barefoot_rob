<p>Okay, it's absolutely beautiful outside.  I'm going for a walk.  I
invited/encouraged/begged Jack to go, but ... a body at rest tends to
stay at rest.</p>

<p class=date>4:38pm</p>

<p>Walk was nice.  Clear sky.  Sun.  Breeze made it a bit cool, but
definitely workable with barefeet and shorts.  I talked to the guys
working near the manhole that had been spewing unlimited gallons of
clear water on the ground when Sally and I went for a walk.  Turns out
the water was spewing to empty out the pipe (84 inches diameter by 5
miles = a lot of gallons) so they could test it for fractures and
such, which they do every 6 or 8 years.</p>

<p>Allison came by today looking for Sean.  She chatted with Jack and
I for a bit.  Said she broke up with her boyfriend, and that she is
rather excited to be back in New York soon, her first time to be there
and be single all at once.</p>

<p>Her hairdye color is Manic Panic's Deadly Nightshade, I think.
Wow; what a name.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Chatted with Ryan, Jackie, and Annie some online.  Asked them if they
could think of any more Silent Football names that people kept
consistent over several games.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Finished the bulk of rules to <a href="/sf/">Silent
Football</a>.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>In a shopping mall in France with Fred.  I had walked
away from him and came back to find him haning money to a fat guy who
grabbed it without trying to look conspicuous, except that he had to
reach over to get it.  I asked Fred what was the dealio and he was
all, "dammit $100 for nothing'" as he had apparently been looking at
some new shoes and shit fat cat had told him that he could get Fred
the soes for $100 instead of the price indicated.</p>

<p class=dream>A few minutes later Fred was approached by a cop who
tied his hands behind his back and tied his feet together, and dragged
him, still standing, back to his police office in the mall.  I was
all, "hey that's my brother, where are you going?" etc etc, but the
cop cat wouldn't answer my questions.</p>

<p class=dream>Once we got to the station, he wouldn't even tell me
where I could call to find Fred, nor even if he would stay in the
city, or the country.  (I resisted asking if he would stay in the
world)</p>

<p class=dream>A woman came up to me all, "he probably will," but I
didn't know if she meant he will stay, or he will go, or what.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>Had just arrived at KTRU and Meg as in the station.  I
was the next DJ and I put on some music randomly as per my usual
custom, and then i realized I needed to read the MRA on, so I fumbled
around to find the headphones and the voume dial to keep from getting
feedback, and none of the controls are how I remember them, and I keep
getting feedback until I turrned the headphone volume all the way down
so I can't tell if anyone can hear me or not.  I begin to read the MRA
on from memory, and then I'm looking down at where the MRA on used to
be written and it's not there anymre.  It's a new thing that is not
waht I'm supposed to be reading, and I had to pull up that laminated
pece of paper to find the MRA On, all covered in sawdust and diffiuclt
to read; I pulled up the paper, and sawdust ad gotten all inside the
sealed thing so I had to hold it sidways to make ths awdust shake don
to one side so i could read it and then hold it the other way so I
could read th other half of it.  Just totally unprofessional and
crappy sounding, and I finally got through it and was so mad that I
had sounded like shit that I was going to complain to Will Robidee,
but I woke up first cause I was cold.

<p>Only had on a sheet for covers.  Now I have two quilts as well.</p>

<p>OH my gosh</p>

<p>I just called Nova to see if, maybe I had given them the wrong
address, and it turns out they sent my job offer package to
Greenbriar!  I know fo sheezy that I didn't give that address, but
whatever; I gave them my current address and they'll send me another
offer sooon.  Should get it next week.</p>

<p>WHOOOOO!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>Due to this delay, I have missed the February deadlines, so if I'm
speedy gonzales about getting the information back to them, I can go
as early as March.</p>

<p>They will send me my new address about 2 weeks before I leave.
fuckin' A I have time to make another month long trek across all of
February!  I could go see my peeps in West Virginia again; I'd really
like to do that.  And Hawaii doesn't sound half bad.  Wow
wowowowowowowow whoohooooo!!</p>

<p>Janette said she feels like she's in Heaven.  I looked around and
pretty much had to agree.  Except for Congress Avenue (which I was
facing; she was not), the beautiful sun, mostly clear sky with high
sirrus clouds, Austinites with funky clothes and funky styles,
chickadees trying to eat our crumbs, carefully manicured gravel
porch..  just like heaven.</p>

<p>Funny:  Janette leaned toward the music playing, "is that Jurrasic
Five?"</p>

<p>"I dunno.  I don't listen to 'current popular music.' Kids these
days listening to stuff like 'hip hop,' I mean what is that?  c'mon."</p>

<p class=date>3:47pm</p>

<p>Been hanging out at Fred's.  Saw Bill for a bit but he split after
not too long.  Bill and Janette yammered while Fred showed me his room
and how he used my old shelves well, including working on the paper
clock that Wende got me for Christmas 1996 on the shelf that I used
for my monitor.  Bill left; Fred and I made smoothies while cracking
up telling Janette about our home videos including Pete going
"..Bill!" when Fred asked "big brother, what's your name??"  So
funny!</p>

<p>Fred and Janette yammered while I chatted with Ma about random
stuff and things and whatever.  Good chatting with her, especially
with such optimism about my Japanese adventure.. and that she will
soon have a chance to preach for two weeks or a month in Virgin
Islands, New Zealand, or Australia!  Awesome blossom.</p>

<p>Janette and I dozed on the couch while Fred yammered with the phone
about a transportation conference in Washington.  He's not sure how
he'll afford it or where he'll stay.</p>

<p>Now we're going to see <em>Lord of Rings: Two Towers</em> (second
time for each of us)</p>

<p class=date>11:54pm</p>

<p>Janette and I are back at home in Dallas.  LoR was good.  Yay Liv
Tyler, even though Fred wasn't impressed with her.  Yay funny lines
"You're late."  "Don't tell the Elf."  "We've decided ... you are not
Orcs."</p>

<p>Janette and I chatted about YRUU and travel stories all the way
home.  We might go to Hawaii together in February!</p>

<p>We also stopped at Starbucks in Temple so Janette could get hot
tea.  The cuties behind the counter gave me a free hot chocolate!
Whoohoo!  I tried to get their names, but they sneakily didn't tell
me.</p>

<p>I'm in Austin now, helping Janette rearrange her space in the
Uncommon Objects antique shop on Congress Street, I think.</p>

<p>We've been here for a while; I've carried some heavy stuff and
helped her hang and unhang things.  Now she is moving a bunch of
little stuff around, consolidating two different spaces that she had
into one, so she doesn't have to pay an extra $ per month for the
other space.</p>

<p>My day today seemed vaguely productive, if I stretch the meaning of
the word.  I helped unload and reload the dishwasher, chatted with
Ryan about his <a
href="https://boyinthemachine.tripod.com">website</a>, and watched a
single funny scene from <em>I'm gonna get you sucka</em>, the one
starring Chris Rock where he comes into the shop asking how much it
costs for the ribs.</p>

<p>Logan and Josephine came home from school during lunch today and
had rented <em>Amalie</em> (sp).  Watched part of it, went back to
school, and arrived back at home about an hour later, saying "we're
getting back to school a little bit at a time,.... actually our
teacher wasn't there so we left."</p>

<p>I called Maggie to remind/bug her about calling UH to reserve a
room for my 12000th day party.  She called them and will hopefully
have a confirmation from them in a couple days.</p>

<p>I did not mail Bryn's guitar pin to her, but I'll hopefully do that
on Tuesday, maybe from here in Austin.</p>

<p>I'm falling asleep.</p>

<p class=date>3:47am</p>

<p>Wow.  I'm surprised at how late it is.  Time to go.</p>

<p>Last night we watched the first half of Lord of The Rings on DVD,
using my computer to play it.  Janette joined us part way through, and
went to bed before it was over.  Josephine fell asleep during the
movie.  Sally and I made it through, though I was close to falling
asleep a couple of times.</p>

<p>(Sally here is YRUU Sally, not Sally in Cali)</p>

<p>The movie was pretty good; my favorite character is still Arwen,
though I wasn't as blown away by the scene where she conjured up the
river horses to wash away the wraiths as I was when I saw it in the
theater.  Must be that the screen on my computer is 2 orders of
magnitude smaller than a movie theater screen.  And these speakers are
an inch across.</p>

<p>Sally had come over last night with Tanner and Josephine after they
had dropped off Mikey and Tyler (I think I'm getting this correct).</p>

<p>Last night when Janette, Josephine, and I dropped off Tanner at the
bus station, we waited with him in line (Jack and others had
apparently said this was the grossest bus station in the world, though
Joel said only the one in Amarillo is worse.  I went in barefoot
anyway and found it not all that bad.) while he checked his bag.  It
was so crowded getting to the gates that we just saw him off as we
headed for the exit.</p>

<p>On our way back home we picked up some chinese food from a small
restaurant with good food.</p>

<p>We watched the second DVD of first Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of
the Ring today.</p>

<p>Richard came over just as it was ending and I was all, "we just
started this movie; we can rewind it if you want."</p>
