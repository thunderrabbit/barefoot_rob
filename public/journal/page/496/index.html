<p>Tom and Jon checked out of I-group tonight.</p>

<p>Robin, Dennis, and I were the onlly ones left tonight.</p>

<p class=date>6:55 am 2-4-02</p>

<p>I went to Wende's to pick up stuff from her, and I had a heavy feeling of
sadnes while there.  I didnt really have an idea of what it was about.  I
told her that Tom and Jon left I group, something else, and then mentioned
that Erika came to lunch toda and I thought that I would get to hang out
with her, but I didn't.  And I really cried a significant amount about that.
It tok some effort for me to just stay in the emotion and experience it as
opposed to being all, 'how can I be so sad about that?'</p>

<p>Wende asked if she could give me some fedback: 'mostly, I just hear that
you are tired.'</p>

<p>'The truth is that when I said I was up late last night, I meant I was up
until 4:45am.'</p>

<p>'Why?'</p>

<p>'Talking to Kristen and Catherine at Biba's.'    and then, 'thank you for
listening to me.'</p>

<p>'Sometimes it's hard to listen because I'm afraid you'll say, 'and then
we kissed,' or something.'</p>

<p>'I hear you.  At this point, it really doesn't look like that's going to
happen.   So far since I broke up with you I have broken up with Dude's
friend Amy, I think I've broken up with Lee-eh, and I broke up maybe with
someone else.'</p>

<p>'One day you will learn that you don't have to be with someone to be
worthy'  or something like that.</p>

<p>Four incidents while riding my bike to I-group tonight:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I was riding pretty fast on the sidwalk beside Richmond.  In
the upcoming intersection, a car was waiting at the light pulled
forward enough to block the pedestrian crossing (not that one was
marked).</p>

<p>I was going too fast to comfortably go down the sidewalk into his
street, curve around him and then back onto my previous path, so I
considered jumping into the street way back here so I wouldn't have to
do a quick dogleg around the car.</p>

<p>Looked behind me - no cars for a mile.  Bunny hopped sideways
toward the street, but I didn't get my back wheel up far enough to
clear the lawn between sidewalk and street.  In the air... falling
sideways... street coming soon... landed kinda sideways on the street.
Scraped my left forearm under my elbow, bonk on left hip, slight
scrape on left knee, bruise on inside left ankle where the crank on my
bike landed.  Glasses were a bit sideways, though my head didn't hit
anything.  Got up, rolled slowly to get my chain back onto the front
sprocket, rode in front of the car that had stopped in my way.  Didn't
notice if s/he noticed me.  Fortunately it was relatively smooth
asphalt and not concrete.</p></li>

<li><p>My back tire came loose as I jumped up a curb.  I'm guessing
this was precipitated from my earlier wreck, after which I had not
checked my components.</p></li>

<li><p>My chain came loose as I jumped off the curb to cross 610 on
Richmond.  This was somewhat bad timing cause I was in the street with
cars behind me in rush hour traffic mode.</p></li>

<li><p>Another car was in my way at an intersection.  I successfully
transferred from sidewalk to street (rode over the grass instead of
bunny hopping sideways) and as I prepared to bunny hop up the curb, I
noticed a puddle 18 inches across or so between the curb and
sidewalk.  So I lifted *hard* and cleared that puddle, but there was
<em>another</em> puddle just past it and my front tire went *splosh*
into it and squirted muddy water on my shirt and hit me in the eye.
Doh!  I was close to arrival, so I didn't stop in search of water
somewhere.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Rinsed my eye, washed my injuries when I got to I-group.</p>

<p>Last night while chilling with Kristen and Catherine at Biba's I
was all "wow" about Catherine's apparent Yoga skillz, and her physical
beauty.</p>

<p>There was a moment while she was just looking at me talking, oh I
know when it was, she was all, "you're a really nice guy, so when you
say something negative about Bonnie I'm thinking, 'oh my god she must
be really psycho.'" or something.  She was all, "you're a really nice
guy," and the message in my head was thinking "you're a really nice
guy, but... [for whatever reason] I can't date you." and then that's
not what she said, but started talking about Bonnie, and I was just
like, damn Catherine your face is so pretty!  Your face, hair, eyes,
smile, cute little nose.. wow.</p>

<p>I will be sure to maintain what's best for me if I start hanging
out with her Yoga-style.  She invited me to be one of her students,
and I imagine part of that is her just trying to get students, so I
think we should be clear that it will be a good thing for both of us
before we get started.  We're smart; we can do well.</p>

<p>D is an idiot.  Why am I so short tempered with him?  How can he
be so old and so dumb all at once?  how does this serve me to be
pissed at his ineptness?</p>

<p>I am just trying to get some work done around here and he's fucking
around with the phone system that we've had for over a year and he
still can't figure it out.  And I'm not talking about how to set up a
conference call with someone or how to transfer someone to voice mail,
not that those are hard to do, but I'm talking about fucking hanging
up the fucking phone.  The speakerphone in this case.  How can he not
know how to use and hang up the speakerphone?  Oh and when he was
paged, he said hello and they couldn't hear him so the instant obvious
no-fucking-shit solution is to click the mic button.  And then to hang
up, click the hangup button.</p>

<p>fuck!</p>

<p>Why am I so worked up about this?</p>

<p>Last night I was up until 5am this morning after talking to Kristen
and Catherine at Biba's.  We were at Biba's until 4:30am.</p>

<p>So fun hanging out with them; they are hilarious!</p>

<p>This morning I let myself sleep in until about 9:30am and then I
got ready quickly and zoomed on my bike to work.  I got from my
complex to work in less than 60 seconds.  (That does not count walking
my bike <em>through</em> the complex.)</p>

<p>Erika came in for a <em>brief(!)</em> visit.  I was a bit let down;
I thought she was staying for lunch with us, but no.  She will,
however, be in Houston during the summer, and therefore may be here
more often.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I'm in nin din mode about to work on the project I was working on
Friday - converting excel file to html.</p>

<p class=date>4:43pm</p>

<p>Okay, I've finished the first phase of the excel->html process,
validating the integrity of values in the excel file.  Now I write
code to actually produce valid HTML output.</p>

<p>Well, first I flowchart steps to produce valid HTML output.  Then
I'll leave for my men's group.  Then go see Wende and help her with
some investment club stuff.  Then go to bed.</p>

<p>I'm at Maggie's house now, Maggie-sitting her while she packs.  She's
telling stories about her reaction/breakup/arguments with John surrounding
their breakup.</p>

<p>I'm so thankful for my much cleaner breakup with Wende than Maggie and
John are experiencing.</p>

<p>Later this day I went to KTRU to drop off stuff for Abi, and then
um, oh that was the night I went to see Parade with Kristen.</p>

<p>After Maggie-sitting, I drove to KTRU where Abi was
finishing up the Children's Show, which she does every
Saturday from noon to 1pm.</p>

<p>Before I arrived, she played my request "Little
Noah Brill" by Momus, off his 2CD set <em>Stars
Forever</em>, which I reviewed in 1999 (April I
think).  Thanks, Abi for playing it!</p>

<p>I went to the station to give her the Salvador Dali
print that I received in London after visiting the
exhibit of his work.</p>

<p>Wonderfully, Jordan arrived just before I intended
to leave, which was great news because I gifted to him
the KTRU sticker that visited London and Paris and is
in many photographs that I took during that trip.  I
gave him the sticker because he volunteered to cover
my shift tonight while I'm at the play with Kristen
and Jessica (sisters) to see Katharine and Catherine
(homonyms).</p>

<p>Now I'm at Dude's house with plans to begin
composing my journal entries and pictures from the
trip.  But his computer with all the pictures on it
locked up when I opened Photoshop.  I just checked. 
It's still locked. 3 finger salute doesn't work; gotta
hit reset, it seems.</p>

<p>Have just arrived back home after going to see <em>Parade</em>, starring
Katharine and Catherine, friends of Kristen.</p>

<p>I feel quite tired and don't know if I'll get it all down.</p>

<p>The movie (*) is not about a parade, although there's a reference to a
parade in the show.  It's the story of Leo Frank, who was accused of raping
a 13 year old girl in his factory.  He seemed to be pardoned by the governer
of Georgia, but then a mob killed him, according to the book.</p>

<p>What impresed me most was the freezes that the entire cast had to do on
occassion.  Just to stand so still for so long is too much for me.</p>

<p>Fuck I'm falling asleep as I write.</p>

<p>The show as much heavier plot and subject than I expected.</p>

<p>I was impressed with how many actors and actresses I recognized from
previous shows.</p>

<p>After the show Kristen, Jessica and I met Catherine at Biba's and were
soon joined by Katharine.  Lots of laughter and funniness, but Katharine
left a big early with sore gut region.  We laughed for so long about so
much, until we were gasping for air between funny sound effect making when
someone pointed to someone else.</p>

<p>had to be there.  So funny!</p>

<p>I have been taking time for myself in the mornings
- like 1.5 hours to get ready, including eating a good
breakfast (*), taking some chillout time to eat,
etc.</p>

<p>This is something I have not preiously done, like,
at all.  Maybe a few times, but nothing like making a
habit out of taking time for myself in the
morning.</p>

<p>For years I have 'known' I would benefit from this.
 I'm thankful that I'm doing it now.</p>

<p>Maggie called yesterday (I had left my phone at
home) and said she's decided not to move on Saturday,
but still invited me to come play with her in the
morning.  I'll call her today to plan our
adventure.</p>

<p>Um,... oh I get to check today to see how well <a
href='https://spamassassin.org'>Spam Assassin</a>
worked.  Hopefully I'm onto something great with
that.</p>

<p>there was one more thing....</p>

<p>Oh, tonight Kristen and I are going to find some
Texas postcards that I'll send to my new friends met
while in Europe.  :-)  hooray!</p>

<p>Tomorrow day I'll go to Dude's and work on
organizing pics from my trip, and tomorrow night
Kristen and I are going to see Catherine and Katharine
in a show at <a
href='https://www.masqueradetheatre.com'>Masquerade
Theatre</a>.</p>

<p>(*) bunch of vegetables and some protein like eggs
or fake tofu-meat</p>

<p>Today at work I wrote some pretty cool code that hopefully begins
the nucleus for a tool that we'll use to make prettier surveys.  Most
of the surveys that I've worked on have been functional, but not
particularly asthetically pleasing.  This should help us easily make
them more pleasing to the eye as well as work correctly.</p>

<p>Specifically, I began writing gsu_xls_to_html.sas, which imports an
excel file, error checks it, and will write html representing the
input fields of a survey that the excel file wishes to create.</p>

<p>But right now I'm going home and then to Whole Foods to purchase
groceries for the week ahead.  Then I'll probably hang out with
Kristen later tonight.</p>
