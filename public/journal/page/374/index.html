<p>I seem to have more thoroughly lost my phone than the last time I
thought I lost it.  I remember using it to call Janette this morning I
think.  And I've only been to Tsunashima since then.  I wonder if I
left it at one of the shops..  I remember my phone's string handle
thing recently got stuck on my keys when I was digging out some
change.  Was that just a bit ago at Lawson's?  Or was it earlier at
the food store?  Hmmmmmm.</p>

<p>I can walk to Lawson's now, but I think the food store is closed
for the evening.</p>

<p>Ah well.  I'll get it back; it couldn't be far.</p>

<p class=date>9:37pm</p>

<p>What makes me most anxious about having misplaced my phone is the
idea that Janette might call to chat and I'll miss the call.</p>

<p class=date>9:51pm</p>

<p>Okay.  I'm a bit stuck on this.  Sigh.  Release.  release
release.</p>

<p>My phone had turned into my umbilical cord to Dallas.  Fuckin' A,
man; let it go.</p>

<p>Wandered a bit around my city this morning, beginning to memorize a
few landmarks.</p>

<p>I intend to memorize the stations between my house and work as
well.</p>

<pre>
Tsunashimia (home)
Motosumiyoshi
Hiyoshi
Musashi-Kosugi (change to Nambu line)

Musashi-Kosugi
Mukaigawara
Hirama
Kashimada
Yako
Shitte
Kawasaki (work)
</pre>

<p>The post office in my city is closed on Saturdays and Sundays.  I
need to mail in my tax form thing.  Maybe I can find a stamp at
work.</p>

<p>Has my writing become more terse since I started teaching English?
Some other instructors have described this phenomenon happening to
them.</p>

<p>One trick the trains do is arrive on different tracks in the larger
stations, so sometimes we get off on the left and sometimes on the
right.  The smaller stations aren't so tricky.</p>

<pre>
you can't teach me shit about the tricks of this trade
switchblade with a little switch to switch blades
and switch from a six to a sixteen inch blade
shit like a samurai sword, a sensai

<p class=note>(my chopsticks pulled apart perfectly)</p>

<p>On the way home from work I rode with Olivia on the trains.  Olivia
recently purchased a new bicycle and really promoted having a bike.
She loves it.</p>

<p>As she sped away on her bike I was left with myself.  No bike.  Why
don't I have a bike?  Is it better to send my bike over here from
Dallas or to get one here?  Why don't I just go get one?  (money) Why
don't I just go jump online for a sec and upload my entries? (Money)
Why don't I just get internet access at the apartment? (don't know how
much MONEY it will cost) Grr grr grr grr</p>

<p>Why am I so stuck on money?</p>

<p>Partially I'm money-blind right now.  I don't seem to know how much
is in my account at home; I don't know how much is in my account
here.  I don't know how my money here will get home and how many US $
my yen will become.  Am I wealthy here?  Am I going to be able to pay
off my debt in a year, save up enough $ to travel to Singapore when
I'm done, romp around Europe after that, pay for private Japanese
language tutoring, eat at the sushi train, drink a liter of orange
juice every night, get internet access here at the crib?</p>

<p>Go see Eminem?</p>

<p>Buy more memory for my computer?</p>

<p>What are my priorities?</p>

<p>Why did I originally come to Japan?  (It all started when I decided
I want to be paid to lead youth group tours around the world.  I
called a company and they asked if I had in-country experience.  I
didn't have it.  I decided to live in Japan for a year so that I could
call them back and say "yeah, I've lived in Japan for a year, and I
know Japanese; I know the culture.")</p>

<p>So that makes me think learning Japanese oughta be a priority for
me.</p>

<pre>
Priorities:
learn Japanese
</pre>

<p>Why am I working in Japan?  To pay off the debt I've accumulated
while driving around the country.  So that makes working slash making
money slash winning in pachinko parlors a priority</p>

<pre>
Priorities:
learn Japanese
make some bling bling
</pre>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I talked to Janette and felt much better after that.  It seems that
I'm money-blind right now; I don't know what resources I have
available.  I don't seem to be Zen enough to just say meh; I still
want to pay off my debt, and I still want to see Eminem.  And
Japan.</p>

<p>Whoohoo!  I just got my bank card here in Japan.  Now I just gotta
find which ATMs I can use.  Then I just gotta get my first paycheck on
15 May.</p>

<p>I called my US bank and they said they can't request a funds
transfer from my Japanese bank.  Benny has said we have to wire them,
or maybe he said we could wire them but there's a cheaper way; I
forget; I'll ask him.</p>

<p>Dru writes well.</p>

<p>More like a narrator than just I did this and I did that.</p>

<p>Soaking in the sights at Asakusa, a temple close to downtown Japan.
I might say "this is the Japan I came to see" for it's the most
traditional-Japanese-lookin' thing I've seen so far... except for two
things:</p>

<p>(!) I didn't come to see a particular part of Japan.</p>

<p>(@) We're still in Tokyo.  10 or 12 story buildings overlook the
temple on all sides, with just enough space granted the temple for me
to imagine what it might have looked like 100 years ago.</p>

<p>I witnessed without real understanding people praying at a cauldron
full of sand where they stick lighted bundles of incense.  A large pit
receives probably 1000 yen per minute as people toss in coins and take
a moment to pray.</p>

<p>We took part in one ceremonial fortune-telling that had an English
translation.  100 yen in the slot, shake a shaker of sticks until one
stick comes out, match the kanji to a drawer, pull out the fortune.</p>

<p><em>Both</em> of us got "BAD FORTUNE" with specifics ranging from
"Your mind is unsetttled wondering to leave or to stay." to "Stop
marriage of any kind and new employment."</p>

<p>Verrry interesting.  I flipped a coin three times and 2 out of 3 it
said don't sweat it.  Cool.</p>

<p class=dream>Dreamt that I was invited to one more rally.  Eeek!  I
felt honored and a bit weird to attend after I said I'd already
attended my last, and I wondered if I'd be able to remember all the
names of all the kittens I should know.</p>

<p class=dream>We arrived via bus at the Canadian side of Niagra falls
and saw a model of the city in the water below us, floating like a
future version of our society, one filled with glittering beauty all
around.  I realized it was a dream and ran off the edge of the bluff
and flew out over the water, inviting others to come with me.  No one
else could fly like me.</p>

<p class=dream>In a big circle of people someone said "I did something
on next Thursday ago," and I helped prompt him to correct his English.
He got it without me fully giving it away.</p>

building.</p>

<p>It's actualy suppoed to be a golden flame and this is a brewer
thought it looks more like an office building.</p>

<p>The sun beams glow through the clouds occassionally as mostly cloudy
skies scurry by overhead.  I'm stretched out backwards on the hard
plastic "glass bricks" comprising stairs up to the brewery.  Not
perfectly comfortable, but a nice stretch to offset my backpack.  I
could fall asleep right here but` Dru is chompin' at the bit to eat.</p>

<p>That Dru, always good for a laugh has been secretly pressing keys
while I type with my eyes shut and head back on the steps..  extra
apostrophe by but is his doing.</p>

<p>We've learned a kanji character today "kawa" which means river.
It's basically three vertical lines.  Aright.</p>

<p>Dru's all, "so....   You've *never* been drunk?"</p>

<p>"Nope."</p>

<p>"My goal..."</p>

<p>I thought he was going to say "my goal is to get drunk," and I'm
like damn G there's more interesting things in life than that!</p>

<p>"..is to get you drunk."</p>

<p>I tried to bet him 10,000 yen that he wouldn't, but he said with
that much money on it I of course wouldn't do it.</p>

<p>"I'm going to get you drunk even if I have to inject it in your
arm."</p>

<p>We'll see, big guy, we'll see.</p>

<p>In a quest to meet people, we're going to a party thrown by his
homey Ben tonight.  But the party starts at 9 and trains end at
midnight.  It'll be a 2 hour party max if I want to go home tonight.
Or if I'm having hella fun I'll stay until the trains start again in
the AM.  That would be interesting.  We'll see what happens.</p>

<p>But first we're going to Dru's to watch Simpsons and I'll probably
sleeeep.<p class=date>7:54am</p></p>
