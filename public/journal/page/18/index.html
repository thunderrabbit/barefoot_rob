<p>Been sick as a dog for most of it, but I have had a great time hanging
out at Michael Monkey&rsquo;s in Houston.  Thanks to Great Granny Good Witch
for driving me to the store today to buy clothes and toiletries which
should last a good while.</p>

<p>She has a lot lot lotta masks from around the world!</p>

<p>I have made a good start on the puzzle in the dining room, first
expanding the table, then adding more white backing, then rotating the
inner white backing to reduce waste.</p>

<p>Enjoyed chicken soup, fried chicken, orange gatorade, orange juice,
and chocolate.</p>

<p>Got a sense of what it would be like to have US political news on all
the time, and am glad I do not have that option in Japan.  Brain
overload!</p>

<p>Good times.</p>

<p>Afterward, tried to scan a hand drawn blueprint through a glass table
scanner, but the lighting was too distant to make it work.</p>

<p>I think it has been 20 minutes.  Let&rsquo;s see:</p>

<h5 id="01-51-monday-18-march-2019-pdt">01:51 Monday 18 March 2019 PDT</h5>

<p>yay!</p>

<h5 id="02-00-monday-18-march-2019-pdt">02:00 Monday 18 March 2019 PDT</h5>

<p>I sometimes think I feel it more if I talk.</p>

<h5 id="02-14-monday-18-march-2019-pdt">02:14 Monday 18 March 2019 PDT</h5>

<p>Life is Improv</p>

<h5 id="02-22-monday-18-march-2019-pdt">02:22 Monday 18 March 2019 PDT</h5>

<p>ate a brownie</p>

<h5 id="02-43-monday-18-march-2019-pdt">02:43 Monday 18 March 2019 PDT</h5>

<p>My dad said I am a responsible person.
If anything goes wrong, I am responsible.</p>

<h5 id="03-12-monday-18-march-2019-pdt">03:12 Monday 18 March 2019 PDT</h5>

<p>Okay finally kicked in after another hit.</p>

<h5 id="03-18-monday-18-march-2019-pdt">03:18 Monday 18 March 2019 PDT</h5>

<p>Was able to floss my teeth in 4 minutes but it felt like a lot more in
some ways.  I ate coconut clusters and brownie, and finished eating,
and (an hour) later finished flossing, then my teeth are clean, and
now about to pee.</p>

<h5 id="03-26-monday-18-march-2019-pdt">03:26 Monday 18 March 2019 PDT</h5>

<p>Finished peeing and now cannot quite finishes sentences all in one go.</p>

<p>That seemed like 50 years until this timestamp from the previous one.</p>

<h5 id="03-30-monday-18-march-2019-pdt">03:30 Monday 18 March 2019 PDT</h5>

<p>Oats is flossing his teeth and laughing that I made his name Oats to
protect his identity.</p>

<h5 id="03-32-monday-18-march-2019-pdt">03:32 Monday 18 March 2019 PDT</h5>

<p>Super great to talk with Oats and type at the same time.  Time is
really going slowly in one direction and in this typing direction, the
muscle memory of my typing allows me to keep a good hold on what I
know to be the correct direction of time.</p>

<h5 id="03-33-monday-18-march-2019-pdt">03:33 Monday 18 March 2019 PDT</h5>

<p>This seems like it has been a long time with Oats flossing and keeping
track of which tooth he is flossing.</p>

<h5 id="03-34-monday-18-march-2019-pdt">03:34 Monday 18 March 2019 PDT</h5>

<p>My computer is the size of an imax that is real far away.</p>

<p>While this seems like a long time, it is a short time according to the
timestamps.</p>

<h5 id="03-37-monday-18-march-2019-pdt">03:37 Monday 18 March 2019 PDT</h5>

<p>Oats wife calls this flinging when the bits of food fly from his
dental floss.  How long has he been flossing?</p>

<p>Why are all these timestamps almost the same?</p>

<h5 id="03-37-monday-18-march-2019-pdt-1">03:37 Monday 18 March 2019 PDT</h5>

<p>Why don&rsquo;t I go lie down?</p>

<p>I felt sad to have to check out for a significant portion of the NWTA
this past weekend.  So annoying, and certainly not what I had in mind
for my trip!</p>

<p>Was great to meet awesome men.  I stayed with Steve R in Vancouver the
night before the weekend, and am now staying with Dave M in Victoria
the night after the weekend.  Headed to Houston tomorrow via Calgary.</p>

<p>Hopefully will get to see Marty and M and M twins in Houston!</p>

<p>I am on the non-infamous Delta flight 166 from Narita to Seattle on
which nothing of consequence happened&hellip;.  except I got a Bailey&rsquo;s
Irish Cream because it had the word cream in it and I thought I might
like it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s good!</p>

<p>I watched Christopher Robin movie which was cute.  I considered
watching <em>Bohemian Rhapsody</em> again but my first viewing last month or so
caused the music to rattle around in my head for weeks afterward, and
it is even back now as I write about it.</p>

<p>I started <em>Green Book</em>, but did not finish it because it got going too
slowly.</p>

<p>Was going to watch episodes of <em>The Good Place</em> but the only have the
first 8 episodes of season 3, and not the (spoiler) last few episodes
of season 3.  I watched episode 1 of season 30(!!) of the Simpsons.
Amazing the same voice actors are doing the characters.</p>

<p>Okay back to sleep for a bit because it is 5am.  I think I will stay
awake after I wake up, which should be around 7am Seattle time.</p>

<p>In preparation for this trip, I started my packing list a few weeks
ago.</p>

<p>I had planned to copy it here, but for now, just imagine it.</p>

<p>I pre-packed most of the list a couple days ago, getting down to
computer, phone, and other
stuff I could not pack because I use it daily.</p>

<p>This morning I woke up early, and repacked everything, doublechecking
the list, and taking pictures of all of it, in some kind of just in
case scenario that will not happen.</p>

<p>This morning Lin drove me to the old man skin clinic to get a bit of
cream for my leg, and then met me at the Narita-bound Limousine Bus
stop at Shin Yurigaoka station.</p>

<p>We enjoyed lunch at Ootoya then hopped on the noon bus, which arrived
in Narita by 2pm.  So sweet of Lin to come with me!  We snuggled and
laughed in the back of the bus, then wandered around Narita for a bit
after I exchanged 10k and 20k yen for 105 CAD and 175 USD,
respectively (plus a bit of yen change).</p>

<p>We got soft serve ice cream and then wondered at all the shops in the
airport.</p>

<p>Sat down for about 30 minutes for more snuggles and then finally time
to say adieu.  After going through customs, I called Lin through Line
and waved bye to Lin looking down through the glass as I stayed in
place, walking up the down-escalator until someone else came.  (Almost
no one in line at security / customs.)</p>

<p>I got a quick pass for my new passport so I can whiz through
immigration in Japan until 2023.</p>

<p>Now I am at the gate, just a few minutes before boarding begins.</p>

<p>Today was the last lesson with Sweets Attendants.  (Their office is
being shut down at the end of this month, but I am leaving next week
for three weeks overseas.)</p>

<p>I met Tomoko at CPK at 11am and helped her carry pizza to their office
where we had a party, including candy I bought from the conveni ond
3F.</p>

<p>The party was fun, but afterward I unfortunately let myself get
sidetracked into dealing with some work related Excel spreadsheet
crap, but got it sorted out by moving the spreadsheet into Google
Sheets, where I can use the <code>=FILTER()</code> function.  Why can&rsquo;t I use
such a function in LibreOffice?</p>

<p>That took an hour out of our 4 hours allotted, but then I got to chat
with Midori for a bit about her plans.  At the end of our time
together, I went to the front desk and received a small white wooden
box with four drawers that I plan to use for Marble Track 3 parts.
Tomoko had apparently brought it to the office and apparently does not
want it anymore.</p>

<p>We stood to say bye to a bunch of guys leaving the conference room
right around the time that I also had to go.  That had me trapped a
bit longer than I wanted, during which time I wanted to reiterate they
can ask me for references or whatever they need for job search.  After
the conference room cleared out, I headed out and Tokyo-waved while
walking out the two sets of glass doors.</p>

<p>Gosh I am going to miss the sweets party attendants!</p>

<ol>
<li>I will be traveling to the US for 22 days starting March 13th.</li>
<li>Not packed yet, but have it planned for next week.</li>

<li><p>I have just sent a list of workshops to Tokyo Men&rsquo;s Circle</p>

<p>Men, my stretch was to find workshops that we can do in Tokyo.</p>

<p>I have led #1 and #3 below.  As a group, we did #2 in August 2018
for ourselves, and then again in November 2018 for new men.</p>

<p>#4 can be done online, once a week for 5 to 7 weeks (2 hours per
 week).  This would require some coordination and a trainer from
 the US to help me lead.  I judge it would take a committment from
 6 men to make it worthwhile.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Head Heart and Soul is a 2 hour introduction to the work.  Men
and women can attend.</p></li>

<li><p>Circle of Men, Journey of the Heart is a day long experiential
personal growth workshop.  Men only, but could probably work
for women.  (6-7 hours, including lunch)</p></li>

<li><p>Life Mission workshop lets each man to discover his life’s
Mission, and actions which he can use to bring his mission
present in his life.  This can easily be done in 2 hours.</p></li>

<li><p>Circle Skills training for the classic archetypal MKP-style
integration circle (this gives a solid framework for sitting in
circle)</p></li>
</ol></li>

<li><p>I got a new battery, but it has not worked right.  I understand now I
need to disable sleep mode and let it reallllly run out all the
way.  Dangit.</p></li>

<li><p>Marble Track 3 has over 300 hours of livestream of me making it.</p></li>

<li><p>I probably will not mess with the website for a bit, but the idea
of making it better is tempting.</p></li>

<li><p>The website is at version 2, mostly purple and made by Sanjay and
team in Deli, India.</p></li>

<li><p>The GoFundMe has made $4000+ which more than covers the tickets for my
trip.  We need to set up a company here to keep track of
everything.</p></li>

<li><p>That means I need to start collecting receipts, cause they are
getting pricey!</p></li>

<li><p>I had a killer headache this past Monday from too much
computering, I think.  I can feel another coming on, but I will
head to be soon.</p></li>

<li><p>I am shutting my computer down now/soon and will let the battery run alll the way down</p></li>

<li><p>I think I have a way to fix ConSwi without relying on physics to
keep bricks from going through each other.</p></li>

<li><p>I wanted to work on it today, but did lots of MKP stuff</p></li>
</ol>
