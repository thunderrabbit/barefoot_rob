                        <p><title>engagement rings</title>
<p class=date>3:48am CDT Tuesday 19 September 2000</p>

<p><p>Last night I-group was great for me.  We started talking about sex
(which is almost a rare subject for us) and I expressed
anger/sadness/confusion about me-an-Wende&rsquo;s lack of sex life.  We had
been loving and sexual with each other a lot, but that has mostly shut
down since I cheated on Wende back many months ago.  I have since told
her I will never cheat again, and I have not cheated again, but the
damage is apparently still there.</p>

<p><p>Tom offered me a great insightful thought - that I could offer some
sort of symbolic something as a make-up, something that I could
present to Wende to officially put the past in the past and start with
a new and lovely present and future.  (&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s called the
present!&ldquo;)</p>

<p><p>As he spoke this, I visualized myself presenting engagement rings
to Wende.  I am not one to wear jewelry; I haven&rsquo;t even worn my toe
ring in several weeks.  I have told Wende that I didn&rsquo;t want to wear a
wedding ring, but I know Wende really wants that symbol of our
relationship.</p>

<p><p>This visualization is so <em>not</em> what I expected that it kinda
scares me.  The joy of the possibility grew in my mind.. as I drove
home I thought of something <em>really</em> cool - to call Lyle Lovett&rsquo;s
peeps and do the ceremony on stage at Lyle Lovett concert this Friday
that we&rsquo;re going to attend.</p>

<p><p>I will call Lovett Motorsports (which is local and he owns) to see
who I should call to set this up.  I&rsquo;ll call Sam Malone on <a
href="https://www.104krbe.com">104 KRBE</a> to see if he can hook me
up.  Sam is a sucker for helping his listeners do romantic stuff like
this, but I haven&rsquo;t heard them giving away tickets.. we&rsquo;ll see.</p>

<p><p>He&rsquo;ll be on the air in a couple hours.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>Some college kids partying out in the streets and
spraying a garden hose and getting it close to inside our windows.
Wende and I had our windows open and then these kids had a game of
climbing up ladders and spraying and water was just about to get
inside but I closed the windows just as some water sprayed
in.  Then I opened it again, &ldquo;what they hell are you doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re playing a game; we&rsquo;re in hell [and have to keep cool]&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>Their play just wasn&rsquo;t very thoughtful. &ldquo;No you are not
in hell&rdquo; and I grabbed the hose and accidentally sprayed a girl in the
face.  &ldquo;oh I&rsquo;m sorry about that,&rdquo; I assured her.  She was okay.</p>

<p><p class=dream>&ldquo;Hey we were about done anyway; do you want to join us
for pizza at the pizza place behind your house?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>&ldquo;Sure&rdquo; I said, and we did a slap handshake to seal the
deal.</p>

<p><p class=dream>&ldquo;Subway is non smoking, right?&rdquo;  &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;  I wasn&rsquo;t
interested in being in a smokey area, but I figured I could handle it
for an evening.  They all climbed down the ladders and went across to
the pizza place.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Then Adam (from OKC) and BJ (from Sugarland?) arrived
and they both had wacked out haircuts; Adam had a mullett and BJ had a
perm and was wearing a sundress.  Adam showed off his mullett to me
while he was sitting by the buffet line and got gravy on it.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I went over to the pizza place to find the other kids
leaving; this place was unsuitable for them for some reason; they were
going to Rankin Road.  I was all, &ldquo;no; I&rsquo;m not driving up there.&rdquo;
Then I woke up.</p>

<p><p>Interesting how this dream dovetails &ldquo;reality.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p><ol>
<li>Mia Bella, where we ate last night was somewhat smokey, but I
was willing to stay for our friends (who were not smoking).
<li>I had pizza.
<li>Last night Wende and I opened the windows on our house.
<li>Each Sunday this semester, I drive past Rankin Road to the
Northwoods youth group.
</ol></p>

<p><p>With the windows open, it&rsquo;s quite pleasant and even a tad chilly inside!
I&rsquo;d guess it&rsquo;s in the low 70s to high 60s.</p>

<p><p class=date>5:21am</p>

<p><p>Woah!  I just visited the cats downstairs and it&rsquo;s pretty cold down
there!  Like low 60s!!  Craziness!  A couple weeks ago Houston and
Texas were experiencing record high temperatures- like 110 degree
range.</p>

<p><p>Spot is running around maniacally.  I wonder what has him wound
up.  Back to bed for me, but Wende&rsquo;s alarm is about to go off.</p>

<p><p>Before church I worked on a horoscope viewer thing for Rebecca&rsquo;s
website.  It will hopefully prove simple for her and useful for people
to check out their horoscopes.</p>

<p><p>Church was fun; we painted T-shirts and then discussed what social
action event they would like to achieve soon.  They chose to bring
attention to October 22 Day - which some organization has declared to
be the day to bring attention to (hopefully stop) brutality by police.</p>

<p><p>After our meeting, we cleaned the church.  I helped Amy in the
kitchen and then all of us worked together to move stack all the
chairs in the sanctuary, vacuum, then unstack all the chairs again.</p>

<p><p>Once back at home I&rsquo;ve mostly been working on Rebecca&rsquo;s thing
again.</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>Tonight at about 9pm, the next door building alarm blared for about
5 minutes.  It happened again after Wende was in bed, but amazingly,
she slept through it.  Or at least went to sleep again during the
alarm&rsquo;s cadence.  Amazing how the human body can sleep through stuff
when necessary.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p>A demonstration against the countries with dictatorship governments.
People were all, &ldquo;o - Cuba is so terrible&rdquo; blah blah blah.  and some
other people who were actually from Cuba were all, &ldquo;hey, what are you
talking about?&rdquo; and told the group how the United States secretly has
just as terrible of practices as these other countries, but simply
covers them up.</p>

<p>This man was speaking very passionately for people to open their eyes
o what&rsquo;s around them; he offered personal stories of his family.  Ten
there was some type of shift and this man was on a bus, driving down a
riverbank beside a highway bridge that crossed the river.  The bus
didn&rsquo;t stop, plunged into the river and some people started to climb
out, but this man did not.  I was on top of the highway bridge and
determined to leap from the bridge into the water to save this man and
a couple of other people on the bus (the other people were some of my
youth).  I ran over to my dad who was also on the bridge and said,
&ldquo;time me!&rdquo;  and I tossed my Handspring Visor and keyboard over to him.
I was referring to <em>time how long it takes me to hit the water when
I jump</em>.  I got right to the edge of the bridge to jump and woke
up.</p>

<p><p>I just unied (that&rsquo;s the past tense of to-ride-a-unicycle) from
home to the bank and back.  One of the items on my things to do
<em>was</em> Deposit a check.  I deposited it and now I&rsquo;m back.
Pretty sweaty, but not ridiculously so.  The weather is <em>much</em> cooler
today than it was before the rain and stuff.</p>

<p><p>I did the trek in about 11 short rides.  The longest was a few
blocks and the shortest lasted less than a block.</p>

<p><p>Wow!!  I called Marcel this morning for some insight/help getting
my linux box connected via DSL.  Yes, it&rsquo;s sad, but we&rsquo;ve had DSL at
the house for some months, and Wende&rsquo;s computer is connected, but mine
is not.</p>

<p><p>Marcel suggested that I look at the HCL (Hardware Compatibility
List) to see what ethernet cards are supported.  I looked and found
that my card is supported and it listed a module 3c59x.o.  Hmmm
&ldquo;module&rdquo; was a new thing to me, so I did man -k module and found
insmod.  I looked through that man page and found modprobe.  I man
paged that and found that I can modprobe 3c59x.o and it will install
the module if it can.</p>

<p><p>I did that and <em>wow</em>!  My computer can see the ethernet card!  I
turned on the eth0 interface in X and now I am one little step away
from getting everything to work.  Right now I am able to telnet to my
router, and from my router I can telnet to the Internet.  But I cannot
telnet from my computer to the Internet directly.  Hmm</p>

<p><p>So to write this entry, I have telnetted to the router and then
telnetted to my website and am writing it with emacs.  Marcel and
Kayse and fam are coming over in a bit and he and I will look at it;
I&rsquo;m sure his unix knowledge will help us fix it very quickly.</p>

<p><p>Thanks, Marcel!  You&rsquo;re the best!!!</p>

<p><p>Wow!  In about 5 minutes Marcel determined what was the tiny
missing link to get my computer connected to the Internet.  There was
no default route in the route table that told it &ldquo;send everything else
to the router.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>After that it took 2 hours to get everything configured so it would
start when the machine is rebooted.  But we got it.  Had to add a
little section to the rc.sysinit file.</p>

<p><p>As we basked in our brilliance, I pinged a few sites for fun,
watching the packets come back like little kudos of a job well done.
For fun we tried www.marcel.com.  It pinged back and we were all,
&ldquo;doh!&rdquo;  Then www.lori.com and it did not return packets.
www.kayse.com did not return packets.  We did a whois on them and they
are in fact taken.  Marcel was all, &ldquo;oh!  of course; they would have
said &lsquo;host not found&rsquo;&rdquo; So I pinged www.asdfasdf.com for a host that
would not be found.  We laughed our asses off when it returned
packets!!!  So so funny!!  It&rsquo;s a nerd joke.</p>

<p><p>While he and I were upstairs, Wende, Kayse and the kiddos all
played downstairs.  They loved climbing up the stairs and down the
stairs.  But especially fun was tossing little egg-shaped super balls
off the stairs to bounce all over the hardwood floors.  They got a
little time jumping on the guest bed and chasing the cats around.
Great fun for all involved!  Except the cats.</p>

<p><p>Big hug to Marcel and Kayse as they piled into their car and they
backed up and <em>* crunch *</em> they slightly hit a parked truck
across the street from us.  Doh!  We couldn&rsquo;t find the owner, but he
left a note on their door handle.  We&rsquo;ll see what happens.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m so thankful to Marcel for getting my computer connected!!!</p>

<p><p class=date>5:38</p>

<p><p>Now Wende and I are about to leave for dinner with Susie &amp; Kevin
and Rusty &amp; Shirley, some advisor friends of ours.  I&rsquo;ve been asked by
Wende to wear <em>jeans</em>.  She says I look cute in them, but I&rsquo;m
all, &ldquo;uggh so squished.&rdquo;  I love my loose cargo shorts.  Dassalright;
I&rsquo;m looking forward to dinner with our friends.</p>

<p><p>Wow!  I didn&rsquo;t realize it&rsquo;s after midnight.</p>

<p><p>Wende and I have just played 3 games of backgammon.  She won all
three.  I blotted her more times, but she won in the end because I
required rolling a lot of ones and she required an array of numbers
one through six.  Play was fun in any event.</p>

<p><p>Today I reviewed a CD for KTRU: The something Panthers&rsquo; CD <em>Roll
Panthers Roll</em>.  The &ldquo;something&rdquo; in their name was like Fabulous
or Great, but I think the word started with P.  Not Perfect.
Definitely not Purrfect.</p>

<p><p>Work was pretty good today; it included pizza for Dave&rsquo;s birthday
which was yesterday, but he felt sick yesterday so we celebrated
today.</p>

<p><p class=date>1:01AM</p>

<p><p>The Luxurious Panthers!  I called Tejus at the radio station and he
looked at the CD for me.  Man that was bugging me!</p>

<p><p>Okay, so work was productive; I fucked around a lot with our one
stupid client and then when the day was essentially over, I focused a
lot of time on one of our good clients.. Oh, it&rsquo;s the El Project,
which I have mentioned many days ago.  It&rsquo;s in production now and a
couple of new classes are starting soon.  I was at work until 8pm
working and then till 9pm writing the CD review.</p>

<p><p>Then to KTRU to turn in the CD and I grabbed a few CDs out of the
Swill bin - Willie Nelson for Wende, Tom Tom Club for Maggie, Jimmi
Hendrix for David (one of the youth from Emerson) and that guy who
sings &ldquo;are you gonna go my way&rdquo; but I am too tired to think of his
name.  Lenny Kravitz.  That&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p><p>Also checked out a couple more CDs to review.  Wende and I listened
to one while playing backgammon.</p>

<p><p>Now it&rsquo;s basically time for bed, but I&rsquo;d like to write some more to
catch up from the week.</p>

<p class=date>9:59pm CDT Saturday 16 September 2000</p>

<p><p>Dinner was lovely at Mia Bella.  Best part about it for me was that
the waiter didn&rsquo;t write down our order.  He just nodded &ldquo;yessir&rdquo; or
&ldquo;of course&rdquo; to each person who ordered.  &ldquo;So classy,&rdquo; said Susie.</p>

<p><p>We played Two Truths and A Lie and then I played Two Lies and A
Truth.  I had calamari, then a crazy pizza with mushrooms, olives,
artichoke hearts, tomatoes and cheese, then Devilish Devils food cake.</p>

<p><p>Total bill for six peeps = $138.  Quite a splurge for Wende and I,
but certainly worth it.</p>

<p><p>Then everyone caravanned over to see our house.  I love it love it
love it!  We are so blessed and I&rsquo;m so thankful.  I am so happy that
we have Had People Over now - 7 people just today.  This is a pretty
big deal for Wende who feels that the house must be pristinely perfect
before anyone comes over.  We&rsquo;re getting better.</p>

<p><p>Now it&rsquo;s bedtime.  (10:04pm)</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m hooked up with DSL! Wheee!!</p>
