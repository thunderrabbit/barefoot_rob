<p>Lin drove Ma and me to Lake Motosu.  Super great to have a perfect
break in the rainy weather on the way there and at the lake!  Now on
the way back, it is slightly foggy. (500m visibility)</p>

<p>Before laking, we ate next to four pugs whose owners had outfitted
them with vests with ice pouches on their chests.  While we ate,
several bicyclists arrived (after we had passed them on the road on
the way up).  I apologized for passing them, but I don&rsquo;t think they
understood.  (Lin said we had passed them, and I said sorry, so I
doubt they know what I meant.)</p>

<p>After lunch, we headed down to the lake and I was like, &ldquo;hmm I should
have brought shoes&rdquo; because the lava rocks were a bit tough underfoot.
We took a couple pics next to the lake and then we all squeezed into a
paddleboat with Ma steering as Lin and I paddled.  30 minutes was
enough of that for me!</p>

<p>The lake water was relatively clear, though there was one (1) big
gross diesel boat on the lake which seemed super disruptive
considering the number of paddleboaters, wind surfers, standing
surfers, swimmers, canoes, and other human powered vehicles on the
water.</p>

<p>We went back to the car and I was surprised Lin was ready to go; I
suggested we go sit among the trees, and was glad Lin and Ma agreed.
Ma went for a walk while I slept for a tiny bit.  Lin coordinated when
the guy will come to make sure they can put the AC in my room (either
Monday or Wednesday).</p>

<p>Now we are headed back!</p>

<p>While writing the above, I saw a lone hill from which paragliders
apparently launch, and then on the other side of the road, a
playground thing that I would enjoy playing on but wouldn&rsquo;t feel
comfortable climbing all over it like crazy while so many kids were
there.</p>

<pre><code>Using thread, I suspended a bearing plate from a broom over my
set.  I did not have a good way to adjust the length of the
thread, so I used several layers of thick cloth (socks) on one
side of the broom to allow the plate to descend toward the stage.

Using Dragonframe's increments on a bezier curve, I got the plate
to do some vaguely reasonable side to side motion as it came down.

Special thanks to my friend Kai for providing the toy skeleton to
be my RC bearing plate pilot!

<p>Oh XCode, you&rsquo;re so quirky.</p>

<p>You automatically change Images.xcassets, automatically <code>add</code> the
changes to git, AND automatically restore the changes after I revert
them.  This might be helpful if you did not <em>also</em> refuse to build the
app due to missing images.  I hate building iOS apps.  Utterly shit
experience all the fucking time.</p>

<p>Why do sandboxed users have to have difficult passwords?  I don&rsquo;t mind
good passwords for real users, but not for sandboxed users.  AND keep
your password requirements written near where we make the users.  I
had to look that shit up on Stack Overflow.  OH, so not only must it
be 8 characters, have numbers, lowercase and uppercase letters, we
cannot have consecutive letters, cannot have common passwords, and
something else?  Screw you and your password requirements for
sandboxed users Apple!   Why not do something like support your devs
by making a ChuckNorris password that we can all just use?</p>

<p>test@apple.com with password SteveJobs (or if we have to fit your lame
requirements Stev3Jobs) AND THEN JUST LOG IN!!   Use the Device ID to
distinguish who is whom.  Or even simpler, drop the requirements for
strong passwords for sandbox users!</p>

<p>Now that I got logged in, I get &ldquo;Transaction error: Cannot connect to iTunes Store&rdquo;</p>

<p>Welp, I gave in.  But I like to think my computer gave in.  There have
been a couple of times this summer that I could not get work done
because my computer overheated and refuxed to turn on or do things
like accept keyboard / mouse input.</p>

<p>My room gets a bit hot, even with windows open,..  and I realized
recently, I have taken more naps because of my computer (and I)
overheating, so it has actually affected my income.</p>

<p>Oh Fraggle, fine I will get an AC.  I am sorry, Earth.  I hope we can
still be friends.</p>

<p>While preparing for my next scene, I realize I want to add a blur
effect, so I
<a href="https://www.stopmotionanimation.com/forum/topics/please-introduce-yourself?commentId=6519681%3AComment%3A200968">introduced myself on stopmotionanimation.com</a>
because</p>

<p>I just came to the most technically difficult part of my movie: flying
a helicopter (flat bearing thing) into the scene.  I have an idea for
how to rig it up with thread to simulate flight, but I want to add an
effect of motion blur on the blades of my helicopter (flat bearing
thing).</p>

<p>It seems Dragonframe cannot do this, but the effect can be simulated
by merging some images in post processing.  At 4:38 in this video is a
suggestion for how to handle the images in Dragonframe</p>

said she was into 60 foot physics.  What do you mean by sixty foot
physics?  Like from this spot right here, exactly sixty feet in all
directions, what happens?</p>

<p>and my alarm went off</p>

<p>MKP GST meeting has been cancelled this month; that&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t see

<p>yay!  Ma is here!  Great to see her!</p>

<p>She was with Lin when Lin picked me up from the station; she brought a
bunch of my diaries!  I wonder if/how I will ever transcribe them all.</p>
