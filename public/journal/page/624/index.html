<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to go write a journal entry,&rdquo; I announced.</p>

<p><p>Molly goes, &ldquo;what are you going to call it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I dunno.  What do you want me to call it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Are you going to call it &lsquo;spot&rsquo; like all the other entries this month?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What??&rdquo;  defensively.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Just teasin&rsquo;.. only two of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call it Molly.&rdquo;  but I secretly misspelled it.  Muwahahahah!!!</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>Last night I rode my (borrowed) unicycle again!  I didn&rsquo;t do as
well as two days ago, but still was much better than day 1.  I
actually felt just <em>tired</em>, super low energy as if I hadn&rsquo;t
eaten enough recently.  I sat on the curb and waited for Wende to get
back from the grocery store.  (We had just eaten at Taco Bell and she
was going to pick up milk on the way home.  She came back with lots of
bags full of groceries.)</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>This morning, Will and Molly helped Wende and I get the last last
last of Wende&rsquo;s stuff out of her apartment.  She doesn&rsquo;t have to move
out until tomorrow actually, but we&rsquo;re not <em>that</em> good at
procrastinating.</p>

<p><p>As we were getting the last of the stuff, Rick came out and
described his recent adventures as he and his best friend Doyle were
mountain biking.  Doyle had an impressive accident and had been in ICU
for 2 days.  He&rsquo;s getting much better, but is still in the hospital.
His story sounds quite similar to my skating accident in <a href="/skate/skate06.html">1994</a>.</p>

<p class=date>7:44am CDT Friday 28 April 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Last night I pulled out (from my trunk) the old unicycle.  It&rsquo;s
been since my last journal entry that I&rsquo;ve ridden it; I&rsquo;m guessing
over a month, maybe two months ago.</p>

<p><p>Delightfully enough, I have discovered that unicycling is just like
riding a bike; once I&rsquo;ve learned how, I didn&rsquo;t forget.  Granted, I
wasn&rsquo;t great at it, but last night I rode just as well as I had the
last time!</p>

<p><p>After a couple of false starts, I rode the two blocks to my old
apartment (including across the 4 lane street and halfway up the
driveway slope!)!</p>

<p><p>Nancy was outside talking to her plants and cats; we exchanged some
stories of the past couple weeks since I&rsquo;ve seen her.  More cats have
immigrated to the area.  My old apartment is being super-refurbished
and will probably rent for $650 (I was officially paying $435, less
$10 to $60 for doing work around the apartments each month).  They
locked all the windows so I couldn&rsquo;t sneak in to look.</p>

<p><p>I wonder if anyone still has a copy of the key. ;-)</p>

<p><p>Of course, I will come in during the day and ask permission to take
pictures.</p>

<p><p>A dude named John Green cold called me at work.</p>

<p><p>He was all, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re a website marketing firm&hellip;have you ever heard of us blah blah we have 9 billion hits and crap.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I told him we are not interested in them helping us market our site.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How can you know you&rsquo;re not interested if you don&rsquo;t know what we will do for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Because we don&rsquo;t need to market our site.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I thought you were in charge of marketing your site.  How can you be in charge of it if you don&rsquo;t do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in charge of making sure our site is not marketed.  It&rsquo;s invitation only.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s weird.&rdquo; [click]</p>

<p><p>Asshole hung up on me!!!</p>

<p><p>Hey JerkFace John Green!!  You&rsquo;re a jerk, a real kneebiter!

<p class=date>7:18pm CDT Thursday 27 April 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Spot is the coolest cat in the planet.  Loyal readers will remember
from back in the day that he used to leap four feet from a tree branch
to enter my second story bedroom window.  That was cool.  Though we
pulled him away from the outdoors and the tree, Spot has already found
an equally cool trick inside the house.  And this time, I have
pictures.</p>

<p><p>The stairs from the first floor to the second floor have handrails
keeping people from falling into them.  The stairs from the second
floor to the third floor ascend past the top of these handrails.
Below the main handrails, are thin (pencil sized) wires that act kinda
like fencing to keep very small people from falling into the stairs.</p>

<p><p>Spot uses the wires as a ladder to climb to the top rail, and onto
the stairs.  It&rsquo;s a shortcut so he doesn&rsquo;t have to walk all the way
around the stairway.  It&rsquo;s also very cool!</p>

<p><p>Wende saw this trick first, and then Maggie and Molly saw it.  Just
two days ago I saw him do it for the first time.  And today, with
camera in hand, I coaxed him to perform this lovely trick again.  I
snapped 8 shots to start a 24-exposure roll; I hope to use the rest
this weekend and get the pics up super soonly!!</p>

                        <p class=date>4:38pm Wednesday 26 April 2000</p>

<p><p>This morning Wende had to be at work at 6am.</p>

<p><p>Anyone who knows Wende knows that she is not a morning girl.  Regardless, she woke gracefully and left on time.</p>

<p><p>I, however, stayed in bed and had dreams of her arriving at work so early that no one else was there.</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>Before KTRU I visited work to grab the CDs I had reviewed (swill).  I normally don&rsquo;t come in before KTRU, and wouldn&rsquo;tcha know it, there was a problem with our mail server.</p>

<p><p>The problem was only apparent in that our NT machines would time out trying to check email.  The email server itself seemed fine.  Plenty of disk space, very few processes running.</p>

<p><p>I simply issued a reboot command and the machine rebooted.</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>While at KTRU, my boss called.  &ldquo;the mail server is still not working, what should we do?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Um, page Brian?  I forgot to re-check it after I booted it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Raaaaabb&hellip;&rdquo; in a disappointed voice.  &ldquo;Okay we&rsquo;ll page Brian&rdquo; <click></p>

<p><p>I was crushed.</p>

<p><p>The rest of my show sounded happy on the outside, but I was really torn up inside.  Should I call someone in to finish my shift?  Should I quit work?  Should I try to call them back?</p>

<p><p>I finished my shift, but put in a 23 minute song when Nancy arrived to do the next shift.  I left a bit early.  (However, I got lost looking for where to pay my Rice parking ticket from a long time ago.  (My appeal was denied.) I found where to pay, but I had no checks or cash.. Doh!!!)</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>Totally dreaded walking in.</p>

<p><p>Walked in, found myself drawn to the security of the mail server.  It won&rsquo;t yell at me or kill me or fire me.</p>

<p><p>I could tell it had just been booted.  Obviously no one had touched it since I booted it.  I logged on, could find nothing wrong.</p>

<p><p>Sheepishly into bosses&rsquo; office.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t find anything wrong with the server.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>They both turned around.  Boss who called me at KTRU: &ldquo;I have to apologize for becoming so emotional on the phone with you this morning.  It&rsquo;s just that we have to rely on each other so much around here.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;yes&rdquo; meekly from me.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Did you talk to Patrick yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Brian called back and talked him through rebooting the machine.  That&rsquo;s what fixed it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I did.  I just didn&rsquo;t check it afterward.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I thought you said you hadn&rsquo;t done anything at all.  Well, anyway it&rsquo;s fixed now.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I felt like I wanted to say more, but I just couldn&rsquo;t.  Finally I was all, &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t feel worthy of working here.  I see you guys doing all this stuff and then I mess up on whatever&hellip;&rdquo;  I almost cried (and I wasn&rsquo;t acting).  &ldquo;I feel like all I can do is program and not maintain the network.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Karla responded with a joke.</p>

<p><p>The punchline is, &ldquo;In heaven, the German are the mathematicians, the Italian are the cooks, the French are the lovers, the Swiss make clocks, etc.  In hell, the Germans are the lovers, the Italians are the mathematicians, the French make clocks, etc..&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;The point,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;is that we all have our specialties.  And things work best when people are doing what they do best.</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>The conversation went better from there.  I wasn&rsquo;t fired, didn&rsquo;t die, didn&rsquo;t even get yelled it.  I love this job.</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>Today I wrote a sas program that allows people to change the relationship of people who are rating them, and it takes into consideration if their lists are full or not, etc.  I can write programs.</p>

<p><p>Yesterday I mentioned installing the 100% silicone around our shower.  It appears to have cured well (unlike Daniella who works here part time but is sick today) and stuff.</p>

<p><p>This morning progress was made on our phone!  Edna and Mike, dressed quite well for phone repair technicians, came to examine the situation.  They were inspecting the facilities, to see what exactly needed to be added so that we can get a dial tone at the house!  I mentioned that I&rsquo;d like DSL service as well; Mike wrote that down on his yellow legal pad.</p>

<p><p>No word from them though on how long it will take.</p>

<p><p>Also, Jim the architect came by and fixed some of the wiring in master bedroom and study.  The wiring for the light in the ceiling fans was not connected, but now it is.  Won&rsquo;t Wende be surprised to find light in there!!!</p>

<p><p>He also fixed the leak under our kitchen sink.  Oh, and he showed me how to turn off the gas in our fireplace.  (There was a panel that looked like it should open.  I pushed it, pulled it, tapped it, slid it sideways, but I hadn&rsquo;t tried to slide it up.)</p>

<p class=date>7:50pm CDT Tuesday 25 April 2000</p></p>

<p><p>I now have a ceiling fan and light in the study!  The study is
kinda &ldquo;my room.&rdquo;  The first time Wende and I saw this house, we got to
the third floor and I turned toward the study.  I addressed it
happily, &ldquo;this can by my room!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Wende had walked into the bedroom, &ldquo;Rob, come look!&rdquo;  The view from
the bedrom superbly frames downtown Houston.  Quite nice.</p>

<p><p>Anyway, back to my room, I just need to hang this elfa track thing
and then all the shelves can hang from it.  There are 20 holes along
the ceiling in one wall, where we twice tried to find a set of 10
holes to support the track.  Two times we hit something solidly metal.</p>

<p><p>Jim suggested that it might be protecting some pipes or wires and
encouraged us not to drill through it.  He didn&rsquo;t know what it covered
though.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m going to suggest that we move the track to the opposite wall.
Wende will certainly be anti-pleased with that.  (Leaving 20 holes in
the first wall.)  I&rsquo;ll quote John to help her concerns, &ldquo;sheetrock is
stupid-easy to patch.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I have just learned that Data from Star Trek has a cat named Spot.</p>

<p><p>Let it be officially declared that without knowledge of Data&rsquo;s cat, I named my cat Spot when I got him 3 or 4 years ago.</p>

<p><p>My friend Laura brought to my attention the situation of the unofficial cat named Spot when she saw the journal entry from April 9th.</p>

<p><p>She sent me a link which I will post here pending the site owner&rsquo;s permission.</p>

<p><p>We have a dial tone at home!!!  I have just moved all my journal entries online from my computer.  Look for names that start with PP up above.</p>

<p><p>From our house, I called Wende on her cell phone.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hey Wende, do you hear that noise?&rdquo;  I was walking on the squeaky
part of our floor between our bedroom and bathroom.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, what is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Is it you farting?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Nope.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I could tell she wasn&rsquo;t in the mood to guess.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the squeak by
our bathroom!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; she sounded disappointed.  Then, &ldquo;How are you calling from
our house??&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Thanks to Mike and Edna; whatever they did worked!!</p>

<p><p>Several journal entries are on my computer at my house.  They&rsquo;ll flood my website as soon as we get a dial tone!</p>

<p><p>Life without email seems just as hectic as life with the extra requirement to dig through all the spam, all the &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; forwards, all the email crap I get.  Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I want the stuff that is funny.  But sometimes the funny stuff appears infrequently.</p>

<p><p>I wonder about email etiquitte in 10 years.  Will it be just as cluttered as now?  Probably.</p>

<p><p>This morning I sealed the edges of our shower with 100% clear silicone stuff.  Because our floor is basically wood, it flexes and the tile joints are cracked along the corner/edges.  All sealed now.  It should be cured in 24 hours = 9am tomorrow.</p>

<p><p>just work workin&rsquo; today.</p>

<p><p>Sunday was a lovely lazy day, although by the evening, Wende and I each found our productivity level too lacking.  To the study with drill and elfa, we began hanging shelves.  Two of ten holes I drilled hit metal through which I simply could not drill at all.  One of those ten holes hit only sheetrock.  The other seven hit wood.</p>

<p><p>Shifted our holes a bit and one hit wood, eight hit sheetrock only, one hit metal.  So, which set of holes will be stronger?</p>

<p><p>I say the one that hit mostly wood.  But what if the holes are just barely hitting the 2x4s in the wall?  Maybe I&rsquo;ll borrow/buy a stud finder.</p>

<p><p><em>huh-huh.  you said &lsquo;stud&rsquo;</em></p>
