<p>Wow.  I just read some about emacs html-mode.  It will simplify
some things that I've been doing by hand in html, but it won't let me
graphically manipulate tables, which is what I'd like to do for
presenting the proposed calendar.</p>

<p class=date>2:20pm</p>

<p>Marta and I are at Paint This!.  She's got a heart, a yin-yang, a
four leaf clover, a star, a flower, and comedy & drama theater masks
on her plate so far.  I've been working on a tile for the new
countertop.  It's the one that we had spot put a paw print on, that
basically looks like a blue blob smear.  I drew little circles where
his paw pads might have been, and then four red claw marks as if he
had clawed the shit out of the tile.</p>

<p>Jennifer is offering to give/find a great home for Spot.  I'm super
thankful for that.</p>

<p class=date>5:52pm</p>

<p>Marta and I hung out; listened to music.  She read random lines
from my Pulp Fiction screenplay and I identified the exact place in
the movie it was from.  The first line she read had been cut from the
movie though, so I didn't get it: "I'm not a cob of corn, you don't
have to butter me up."  I checked out her pics from Prague in the
photo album/scrap book she's making.</p>

<p>Now I'm off to Amy's sister's wedding.</p>

<p>Last night I attended Amy's sister's wedding at Amy's house.  It
was way casual; the bride was barefoot; he was in flip-flops.  I was
barefoot as well.</p>

<p>This is apparently their second marriage together.  They honored
their daughter Raine during the ceremony.  She's about 6 or so years
old it seems.</p>

<p>After the ceremony and buffet style dinner, karaoke was the
entertainment of the evening.  Amy really like karaoke; she has
probably 50 different CDs of music, though they focus on oldies and
country with a little bit of pop from about the 80s and 90s.  Nothing
less than five years old.</p>

<p>Marta called me from Hard Rock Cafe, where she had just been
treated to dinner with her church group.  I invited her over and we
sang Elvira ( by Oak Ridge Boys??).  I know the song pretty well since
my dad had it back in the day; we listened to it a lot.  I gave it my
best country twang and Marta did the low Giddy Up a Doo Wop part.  Big
cheers; it was deemed to be the best performance that night.</p>

<p>Later, after I butchered Arethra Franklin's RESPECT (and Marta
carried it pretty well) we just let a CD play and sang as we were able
the different songs.  Sounded bad enough that we cleared the room.
After some 10 songs ish, we joined the group.  Amy was all, "what
about our backgroud entertainment?"  At least it was appreciated by
someone.  :-)</p>

<p>Great fun party; good job Amy et. al. for successful hosting.  Oh,
and great job to Amy on the awesome slideshow!</p>

<p>I'm sitting meditatively now.</p>

<p class=date>10:08am</p>

<p>That lasted about 9 minutes, and then I worked on my marble track
some.</p>

<p>Now I'm at Christina Branmart's house.  Her patience with Mia is
incredible and refreshing.  When I am a parent, I want to parent
similarly.</p>

<p class=date>11:42am</p>

<p>Christina smiled in a way that said <em>silly Rob</em> when I got
my computer to capture this moment.  I've never had the fun type of
experience at Whole Foods before with all the samples overflowing with
goodies during the day.  I usually only come here at night when
there's almost nothing left to munch.</p>

<p class=date>12:05pm</p>

<p>Just met Roger here in the cafe section of Whole Foods.  He has
recently purchased a 4 unit condo thing on a mountain in New Mexico.
He's traveling to France, Italy, Spain soon.  He blessed and
encouraged my adventure.</p>

<p>For some reason, I don't have my business cards on me, so I drew
him a replica on back of Whole Foods receipt tape.</p>

<p class=date>1:10pm</p>

<p>Christina will email me a list of people around the US who would
enjoy hosting parts of my adventure.  Such a fantastic blessing are
our connections from YRUU.</p>

<p>I just stopped by Amy's Ice Cream to see if they would be
interested in having me work for two weeks.  JD will ask Glen if it
will be worth it to them.</p>

<p>Now I'm outside of Catherine's house; when she arrives we'll do
some yoga.</p>

<p class=date>3:46pm</p>

<p>Yoga was fun.  I'm going to Spy tonight to see if she can help get
me a job as a doorman, checking IDs and such.</p>

<p class=date>9:31pm</p>

<p>Went to La Jaliscience with Marta, who came in from Denton to see
her sister.  She and I will visit Paint This! tomorrow.</p>

<p>Talked to Wende tonight; told her of my plans.  She was fully
supportive and asked good questions.  I had already asked the same
questions of myself, so the discussion was not as challenging as I had
feared it might be.  In fact, she was quite supportive of my decision,
and for this I am thankful.</p>

                        <p class=date>9:21am CDT Saturday 29 June 2002</p>

<p>Last night I drew out a calendar to plan my transition from here to
who-knows-where, and sketched out some possible travel plans.  I'd
like to put them on my site, but I won't do it unless I have an HTML
editor somewhere between emacs and M$ word.</p>

<p>(Hmm.  It appears that emacs has more extensive html editing skillz
than I understood at first. I'll see how well it can do what I
want.)</p>

<p>At 11:30pm-ish, I got a call from Catherine, who asked me to come
to Spy around 12:45am to interview for a job as a doorman.  She met me
outside, told the valet to park my car for free, introduced me to
Morgan, a guy who was checking IDs outside the club.</p>

<p>"You're Rob?" he asked.  "What's your phone number, Rob?"</p>

<p>I gave it to him and as he wrote it down, he said, "You've been
given very high recommendations by Catherine.  Okay, I'll call you in
about a week or two."  Interview complete.</p>

<p>I explained that I am available for work until the 19th.  He
understood, no problem.  He sent me inside the club and I hung out
with Catherine a bit.  She has worked at the front desk taking money
at the door for years.</p>

<p>We watched the 104 KRBE sponsored bikini contest, "this is so
degrading," we both agreed.  The three girls who won were all white,
blonde, fake boobs.  Yo J (who I know from college days) was MCing the
event, and will apparently is there every Friday night.</p>

<p>Catherine and I went upstairs, she got free bottled waters, and I
noticed a banner on the wall advertising the bikini contest had
misspelled receive something like, "the winner will recieve..." tsk
tsk.</p>

<p>(man, look at me all snooty about correct spelling)</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Catherine had to go to a meeting, so I hung around watching some
peeps dance and then left after not too long.  My clothes all smelled
like smoke, which they probably will each time I go inside for too
long (the doorman job is outside, fortunately).  Um, oh, if I get this
job, I will need to boost my clothing repertoire as well.  I'll
probably request some fashion tips from one of my girl friends.</p>

<p>Went to Kinko's and IMed for a bit with Colleen, Sean, Amanda, Bryn
(all from YRUU) but ended up awake too late - got home and showered and
in bed at 4:58am.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>In a classroom situation, a student was outside with
the intention of knocking down the flag pole in such a way that it
would crash into the classroom.</p>

<p class=dream>The professor didn't seem too worried, saying
something like "I wonder what it will be <em>this</em> time?"</p>

<p class=dream>I was all <em>he's going to crash into the school; look
out</em></p>

<p class=dream>But when I saw the plan unfold outside, it was less
than menacing.</p>

<p class=dream>He was down the hill a ways riding on a park-sized
train (that people can ride for fun around a park) and had tied a
cable from the train to the flag pole.  But he had tied the cable in a
direct line to the flagpole, so that when the train moved forward, the
cable would be routed around a tree, severely limiting the destructive
force of the train.</p>

<pre>
    train
====#####==================  train track
     \
      \
       \
        \     # tree
         \
          \
           \
            \. flagpole
---------------------------   edge of school
</pre>

<p class=dream>The train rolled along the track and the student
noticed the cable was now bent around the tree, so he cut the cable
and went to run up around the tree and back to the train, but then the
somehow ran over the cable so he couldn't attach it...  such a mess
was made of his plan.</p>

<p class=dream>It turns out the cable was a high density fiber optic
data cable, so the student was in a ton of trouble for cutting it and
letting a train run over it.  I was put in the position of yelling at
the student, but noisy people were all around me being noisy and the
student was a 6 or so year old girl who was quite uncomforable with
the whole situation.  I was glad to wake up.</p>

<p>I'm hearing noises and voices from next door.  Squeals from Ellen
and a male voice; I hope she is okay.  She sounds okay, but I will
listen.  This is the first time I've been awake this early with her
next door.</p>

<p>I listened against the wall and heard normal voices.  She is
okay.</p>

<p>Hee!  I just tweaked my journal-start macro so that I can run it
from within any buffer of emacs and it won't affect the current buffer
I'm in (unless it's *scratch*).</p>

<p>I have just picked up my new business cards from Kinko's for
$19.11.  500+ cards.  They look great!</p>

<p>I'm at Empire Cafe to meet Kim Sawyer, for what may be my last
coaching session with him, unless he's sure we can get our barter
worked out.</p>

<p class=date>10:43am</p>

<p>Good stuff with Kim.  I have just sent three referrals to Nova -
priority mail for $12.95; they will be delivered by high noon
tomorrow.  I called Nicole to let her know to look for them.  I also
wrote her a note on Power Puff Girls stationary.</p>

<p class=date>12:42pm</p>

<p>I have just added a <a
href="https://www.paypal.com/xclick/business=rob%40robnugen.com&item_name=Rob%27s+adventure+around+the+US&no_shipping=1&return=http%3A//www.robnugen.com/thanks/&cancel_return=http%3A//www.robnugen.com/journal/&cn=your+address+for+a+postcard%3A">donate</a>
button to my journal.  I have considered doing this in the past, but
now I think people are more likely to be moved to do so.</p>

<p>If you donate to my adventure, be sure to enter your address and
I'll send you a postcard!</p>

<p>Lunch with Kristen soon; I'm going to make PB&J and meet her at
Hobbit Cafe.</p>

<p>I just called Wende to see when she will finally get home; it seems
like she's been gone forever!</p>

<p>She answered the phone, which was a huge surprise, and said she is
in Houston at Taco Bell with Bob.</p>

<p><em>Bob?</em> my brain thought about being jealous.  "Who's Bob?"</p>

<p>"Jennifer's husband?" Wende's voice made a question mark at the end
wondering why I didn't know who she was talking about.</p>

<p>"Oh, Bob."</p>

<p>In the background, I heard Wende say to Bob, "get a <em>ton</em> of
hot sauce, don't forget a ton."  Wende is so cute.</p>

<p>"Call me when you have a chance; I have some news for you," I said.
She doesn't know that I plan to vacate the city soon.</p>

<p class=date>11:14pm</p>

<p>Wende never called me back; I'm going to bed now, but I'm going to
read <em>Mutant Message Down Under</em> by Marlo Morgan, a book that
Janette gave to me.</p>

<p class=date>11:48pm</p>

<p>Sleep now for real.</p>
