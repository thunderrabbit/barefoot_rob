<p>Woah.  I'm reminded that I had a dream last night.  I'm not sure if
the dream happened before or after my mouthguard cracked.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>In my dad's living room, my grandpa/dentist was sitting
on the couch to my back right, and his wife was on the recliner to my
front left.  He was looking through pictures and came across some that
showed my teeth before he had worked on them to make the front teeth
all straight and such.</p>

<p class=dream>He showed the picture to grandma, and I proudly showed
her the resulting teeth.</p>

<p>I don't know how my dentist got to be my grandfather in my dream.
Maybe that is based on Wende's PawPaw being a dentist.</p>

<p>Maggie is home on time and it seems like early considering her last
couple of arrival times.  We're going to Molly and Will's for dinner
tonight.  Mmmmmmmm dinner.</p>

<p class=date>8:34pm</p>

<p>Dinner was pork ribs and salad and lemon butter noodles.  Anna (the
16 month human) provided entertainment, Scout (the speedy dog)
provided occasional music.</p>

<p>Will showed us his resume' and told us interesting things he had
learned in a job-getting class.  Like networking is more effective
than a resume' because 80% of jobs are being designed and get filled
before they are advertised, and 20% actually get advertised.  While
20% of people are networking to get their share of 80% of the jobs,
80% of the people toss resumes into a pile to get 20% of the jobs.</p>

<p>I tried to get Scout to slide down the Little Tykes slide, but she
wouldn't go down on it.  Bad dog.  hahahahaahaha</p>

<p>Maggie took me to Colonel Mustard's Frozen Custards for dessert.
Actually it's called Connie's Custards or something.  My name is way
funnier though.</p>

<p>I ordered M&Ms and bananas.  Maggie got a butterscotch blend.  Good
stuff.  Thanks to Maggie for buying.  :-)</p>

<p>Maggie and I are giggling over stories and (her) ice cream now,
like the time after our gang watched <em>Silence of the Lambs</em> and
then Maggie was feeding herself, John, Christine and I bites of cake
off one fork.  I would always politely decline a bite after John had
one, and it took Maggie about 2 bites to catch on to my ploy.  She and
I were giggling then and (we believe) neither Christine nor John
caught on.  They were all like, "whatever.. those weirdos."</p>

<p>Can't find my cellphone, but I called (with Maggie's landline)
Cingular who said that I'm "eligible for an upgrade" which I
translated to mean "encouraged to pay them money."  She said I could
just roll into a store and get the "latest" Motorola 311c (?) for $49
with a $50 rebate.  3 to 6 weeks for the rebate check.  Aight.  I'll
do that so I can have a phone for two more months.</p>

<p>Going now to get my phone.  Pooh that I've lost Rie's phone number
by losing my old phone.</p>

<p>My expectation is that the Motorola whatchamadoodle will be a flip
phone, and I hate those, but I can deal for 2 months with it.  Plus if
it's "free" then fine.</p>

<p class=date>11:32am</p>

<p>I'm closing my Cingluar account.  I rolled into a store and he was
all, "who's Wende?" cause her name is the primary on the account and
"she has to be here" etc etc etc and I left and came back, "okay, I'm
about to call customer service and be really mad, so I'm giving you a
second chance" and he said it was company policy and all that
runaround and whatever.</p>

<p>The long sad story is that we used to have separate accounts, but
when we moved in together, we thought it was silly they were sending
us two different bills (wasting paper and all that) so we had them
merged.  Once we split, we were never able to get the accounts split
without starting a new contract, which I was not willing to do after I
had been a customer with them for a year+ already.  I explained this
to the guy and he was unimpressed.</p>

<p>So, back at Maggie's I just called Crystal and she said Wende has
to call them.</p>

<p>For the record, I didn't yell at her.</p>

<pre>
To: Wende
Subj: cingular

HI Bear

I called them to close the account but they want to talk to you.

Please call them at 800-331-0500, say HI to the cute voice (Cingular's
only redeeming quality) and enter 1 then your information (phone #
then zipcode).  Once she tells you your current minutes, press 1 to
continue, then 3 then 2 to get discuss closing the account.

I would certainly do this for you if they'd let me.  I hope they turn
off the correct phone number.  They can verify this by noting it's the
one with a credit balance of $0.02 cents and that it's been suspended
(though they are still charging me for the service, which, of course,
I am not, at this time (and won't ever (unless some really good reason
comes up) be), willing to pay) because the phone is lost.

I hope and trust this causes you no hardships.  I hope and trust you
can decipher that sentence.

Thank you so much.

    With Love
    - Rob!
</pre>

<p>I think I'll write to them and explain why they are losing a
customer.</p>

<p class=date>12:05pm</p>

<p>I just called my number and it says it's temporarily suspended.  I
could call back, tell them the phone is found, have the message be
changed..  but that would make it all the more confused and I'm just
over it.</p>

<p><p><b>Comment:</b>
<br>that is one of my favorite movies ever, but no one ever agrees with me. <br>
im sorry you lost your cell phone. what a hassle. i recently got a cell <br>
phone. it has already taken over my life. if i lost it, what would i do.<br>
im such a big kid now. actually, i left my cell phone at school on accident<br>
this weekend. im going crazy. i think maybe thats why im online. i havnt <br>
been in a long time. i didnt go back and read all your entries yet, cause <br>
im worried about getting to the rally entry. im sad i didnt go. also a reason among many, mostly that i just hanvt felt like it, that i havnt lj&rsquo;d in a long time either. another funny thing, my house is in the middle of nowhere and the verizon service is really crappy out here, so i dont use the phone anyways while im at home cause it never works. and yet another funny thing, i have <br>
unlimited weekend minutes. sigh. the number, now that you have no phone with which to call me, or a chance of talking to me till monday anyways, or a desire to call my cell phone, cause thats a really weird sudden jump right, is 757 630 4347. hahahah. funny allovertheplace. i hope you can read this, but im sure you can. it seems we sometimes have a swell understanding between us, and even my endless comma sentances and dangling participles cant ruin that. right on buddy. until then. (when?) hah! ok ok, ill stop with the funny. <br>
au revoir.<br>

<p>Trying to coordinate my schedule a bit today.  Gotta do piddly
little stuff like go get replacement blades for my razor; simple stuff,
but it seems so hard to just overcome the inertia of idleness.  I'm
getting better; winding up my engines of metabolism? adrenaline?</p>

<p>Then take a shower and then find my silly phone.  How ironic that
just as I decide to get an external battery charger and start using it
again, I can't seem to find it.  I have a specific memory of listening
to messages and then flopping it down next to the lamp near the couch
where I was sleeping. That was two nights ago.  I Don't remember
seeing it again.  I've lifted the couch and chair and find nothing...
And it's not like 500 people are running around Maggie's house moving
things around.  It's just me and Maggie.  Mostly just me cause she's
been at work 15 hours per day.</p>

<p>Called Kristen and her schedule is undefined quite yet; I was going
to help her move, which I forgot when I told Erika yesterday that I'd
go to PT! with her today, but then I cancelled with Erika when I
remembered needing to help Kristen move.  Kristen said I should just
uncancel with Erika, and we'll see what happens.</p>

<p>Erika's not home; she may already be moving toward her "it's not an
interview; it's a chat" "cool; well you just tell her the way it is."
thing today; I'll roll down to my old Kinko's near my old work and
then maybe be able to meet up with her at our previously scheduled
time anyway.</p>

<p>But first, gotta get replacement razors!</p>

<p class=date>10:30am</p>

<p>I'm at my old Kinko's now.  Drove down 59 where all the
construction had been.  It's not finished yet, but I don't see any
signs that they are tearing up the entire freeway again as Andrea
indicated they had to do.</p>

<p>The houses along the lots between Farnham(?) and 59 feeder have all
been torn down.  Probably townhouses will be there in a couple years.</p>

<p>There's a new Mission Burritos open at Durham and I-10 (on the
south side of 10).  $1 off burrito with coupon.</p>

<p>Been transcribing old entries from <a
href="/cgi-local/journal.pl?date=1987/03/22">1987</a>.  Going to FSD
to see if I can intercept Erika there after her meeting.</p>

<p class=date>1:22pm</p>

<p>I had arrived at FSD while Karla, Drew, Dave, Minh, Clint were
eating lunch in the conference room.  (Clint is a new cat who replaced
Dennis who apparently "got sick of it" and quit in a huff in
August.)</p>

<p>Karla was all, "we were just talking about you!" Wow; how amazing
is that??</p>

<p>I told her I had heard a rumor that Erika might come over and turns
out she had just called five minutes ago and asked if they had heard
from me.  They had not, so she went home.  I was all, "can we call her
cellphone?" and Karla dialed, I talked, Erika turned around though she
had made it all the way to her exit on I-10.</p>

<p>I told stories and answered questions and told them I'm going to

<p>While we painted, Jennifer did a crossword and asked us for input
on various words.  We all did rather poorly, I thought.</p>

<p>After painting, we chatted with Jennifer and saw comics on her
counter, including Get Fuzzy.  On the way back to FSD, I told Erika my
favorite Get Fuzzy cartoon and in the parking lot, we exchanged a
couple of jokes; she told me a good one I hadn't previously heard, and
this one, which was cute:</p>

<pre>
A bear walks into a bar and goes,  "I'd like a beer ..  ....
  .. and some peanuts."

And the bartender goes, "why the big pause?"
</pre>

<p>I told her the one about the grasshopper who goes into a bar, and
Erika starts laughing; she had heard the joke before but encouraged me
to finish it, and the bartender goes "hey, we have a drink named after
you HAHAahahaahahaahaha" and I couldn't finish it without laughing;
that joke cracks me up! Okay, okay, And the grasshopper goes, "you
have a drink named 'Mike' ??"</p>

<p>Hung out with Kristen after hanging out with Erika.  We visited
Whole Foods and chatted.  I invited Madison to my 12,000th day party.
Then we went to Ikea and then to her new apartment.  I was feeling
crummy-ish and didn't want to (a) stop playing with Kristen (b) tell
her I might be sick (cause I really think I'm not) (c) I don't know.
Fuck it just was crummy and I was wuss and agreed that I was bored
after she gave me the option.  It just felt really fucked up cause I
was all feeling poopy pants.</p>

<p>I'm sorry Kristen, that I wasn't more able to speak up and just go
home to sleep.</p>

<p>Maggie called at 6:45, fully intending to leave her work by 7pm to
get me and have us go visit Jillian's.  Oh shit I hope she didn't
intend for me to meet her there. I'll call her cellie.</p>

<p class=date>8:07pm</p>

<p>Haha.  Just as I was leaving a message she drove up.  (I was
sitting outside on her driveway)</p>

<p>Pooh.  Mags didn't answer cause she was (still is) on the her
cellie talking to work.  Love and mental hugs to her.  She says it
should have been so easy (what they're working on).  but it's not
working.</p>

<p class=date>11:12pm</p>

<p>Maggie ended up on the phone until a bit after 10pm.  Melanie and I
checked out Jillian's banquet room; talked to the cat who said they
could seat 135 people there (but it would be pretty cramped).  We
scoped some of the games and the left hand Amazon theme token-sucking
ticket dispensing game gave me 80 free tickets over the course of the
evening.  I could just play around with the controller and it gave out
10 tix at a time.  I never figured out a pattern more precisely than
just wait a minute or 3 and ten more tickets would come out when I
messed with the controller.</p>

<p>Got bored, found Maggie still talking outside.  Walked to Red Robin
to munch.  Melanie and I played pog football with the cardboard
coasters and ordered food.  Flipped a pog to figure out what to order
for Maggie.</p>

<p>She came in by the time I was just finishing my veggie burger.  We
chatted and ate and then I just started playing Silent Football and
they played along.  Melanie remembered the rules quite well for not
having played in a really long time.</p>

<p>Left at 11pm when they closed, grabbed 20 more free tickets from
the Amazon snake machine at Jillian's, walked Melanie to her car, rode
home to Maggie's with the top down on her red Mustang.</p>

<p>Went to Kinko's, got the copies I needed of my passport and printed
out my resume.  Now I'm at a postal place to ship off my stuff to Nova
with overnight delivery.  Zooooom!</p>

<p>Been listening to Sam Malone on 104 KRBE.  Might call in tomorrow
early and tell him I've been on a road trip and going to Japan and see
if I can get a hookup on some good stuff.  SEEya!</p>

<p class=date>9:09am</p>

<p>Whoooohooooo!!</p>

<p>I have just sent off my documents to Nova with overnight delivery
to arrive by 10am tomorrow.  FedEX tracking number <a
href="https://www.fedex.com/cgi-bin/tracking?tracknumbers=838441258096&action=track&language=english&cntry_code=us&mps=y">838441258096</a>
so I can watch it zoom over.</p>

<p>I asked the cat if they had an option to get it there today.  They
used to before World Trade Center got hit.  It was called Sonic
Delivery.  For only a few or several hundred dollars, Whooooosh!</p>
