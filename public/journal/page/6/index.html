<p>After having eaten extra ice cream and stuff late at night on the
31st, I fasted yesterday.  Pretty easy, though I worked out at SOGO.
Usually that would make me woozy if I hadn&rsquo;t eaten, but yesterday
seemed fine.</p>

<p>I have a bit of a headache now, which may be related to fast, or eat,
or not enough water, or upcoming (first) session with Dean</p>

<p>One rule of journaling is to keep it present.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t written about Christine&rsquo;s party not Rin&rsquo;s workshop, but</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m headed to SOGO!  We are apparently meeting in a new location today. I guess there is some kind of festival covering our normal area.
I am super glad I checked, and even more glad Ruri posted the change!</p>

<hr />

<p>Yesterday at the Tokyo Tribe monthly vision planning workshop, we met in B1 of the building from last month.</p>

<p>Sophie, Rin, Hiro, and I attended, and I jokingly said &ldquo;remember back in 2019 when it was just 4 of us at the meeting?&rdquo;</p>

<p>We talked about the viability of larger groups.</p>

<p>Next meeting has been scheduled for a Friday, taking into consideration my Eye Gazing workshop on September 28th!  So thankful and like &ldquo;wow! Is my little workshop really so important?&rdquo; (tears-welling-emoji)</p>

<p>9:58am just arrived at meijijingumae for SOGO!</p>

<h5 id="12-48-sunday-01-september-2019-jst">12:48 Sunday 01 September 2019 JST</h5>

<p>It&rsquo;s not scorching hot like a couple of weeks ago, but still pretty warm.</p>

<p>Today there were lots of new people, and some people I hadn&rsquo;t seen for a while.</p>

<p>Met Mon and Sumin, remet Kinue, Lam, and Mayumi.  Emi wasn&rsquo;t there, but Ruri, Hide, and Moise led.</p>

<p>Anuj confirmed he will attend Past Lives workshop, and Alex seemed interested.  Yay!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m tired, falling asleep on the train.</p>

                        <p>I have often wondered about ways to write journal entries on some small device and incorporate them into my online journal.</p>

<p>I used to use a Handspring Visor, until the foldable keyboard folded for the last time and the Visor perhaps got replaced with a laptop?  It had some way to sync, probably USB.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ve got a handheld screen here with Swype keyboard, and I am writing this as an email to myself which I hope to remember to cut and paste into a full on my local file system and incorporate into my git repository for journal entries.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s not why I&rsquo;m writing.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m headed to Rin&rsquo;s monthly planning workshop in Omotesando.  This will be my second time to attend, and I intend to focus on workshops and, curiously, my website.</p>

<p>I want to continue using my existing git repositories (one for the journal, and one for the site itself (because my journal has lasted longer and should stay intact as much as possible (plus I want to keep up my single word commit messages that tell a story, backwards), as if a repository in a fragile file system supports that) which includes the journal as a sub module), even though &ldquo;everyone&rdquo; is like &ldquo;just use Squarespace!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sorry, nope. Not gonna use Squarespace or WordPress or Ghost.  I&rsquo;ll continue to use Hugo, markdown, and my choice of hosting providers.  I just need some adjustments to my theme.</p>

<p>Specifically, I&rsquo;d like to add some testimonials to my about page, find a nice design for my schedule of workshops and perhaps tweak my tags list to show how many entries are tagged with each tag.</p>

<p>Those changes are of the top of my head, but when it comes time to do them, I get caught up in minutae, like how to adjust the left padding on the border of some div.  Annoying.</p>

<p>Excitingly, I&rsquo;d also like to get feedback on how I can approach the detail of being in the US for three weeks in October.  Any way to continue workshop momentum?  Any need to?</p>

<p class="dream">
One train came and slammed through the car on the tracks.  Another
train came on the adjacent tracks and slammed through the car on
those tracks.  A third train came through and I knew it must be a
dream so I threw the garbage of the KKK uniforms under the train and
watched it be carried away relentlessly by the wheels unstopping and
then noticed the train was not that long so they could see it was me
and I thought good thing it's a dream and then an old black man came
by laughing and we laughed our asses off as they train curved its way
slowly around the whole valley as I started to make up straight lies
"it took them then years to finish those tracks god bless the lives
that were lost falling down the valley" and visualized under water the
skeleton not there as the lie had been told and just fish who didn't
even know what a lie *was* much less that it had been told and didn't
affect their lives in any way.

<p>Several different things on my day off today.  Mostly related to work,
where I realized the value of having a staging server with non-live
data.  &ldquo;Ohhh that is right; I tested saving data as well..&rdquo; when AB
was like, &ldquo;Um, where is the Azabujuban record?&rdquo; which had been renamed
to &ldquo;Doraemon 5e5433a38e2b035689a75c9ed11ffb0e&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once I fixed all of those (about 8 different records) based on the old
live DB which is still available at cli with <code>mysql</code> as root, I
watched episode 3 of The Naked Director.</p>

<p>This show is somewhat a comedy, but fills in my imagination of the
heady days before the bubble burst here in Japan.  I sometimes wonder
what it could have been like then, and this gives me a sense that I
would not have necessarily been better off for being here then.
Interesting to watch, though, and practice listening to Japanese.</p>

<p>I tried to do some more work, but was leaning toward porn after having
watched a shows which leans toward porn, so I took a nap.</p>

<p>Woke up and wrote down <a href="/journal/2019/08/30/dream-unstoppable-trains/">a dream about unstoppable trains</a>.</p>

<p><a href="//b.robnugen.com/journal/2019/dreams/20190830_165150_Dream_0000000249.jpg"><img src="//b.robnugen.com/journal/2019/dreams/thumbs/20190830_165150_Dream_0000000249.jpg" alt="20190830 165150 Dream 0000000249" /></a></p>

<p>And as I write this, I see the messy image and realize if I ever clean
up those images, I hope I either create redirects or think to fix the
links here.</p>

<p>Mohamed asked the URL for my journal, which is nice timing because
today is the first day for me to use ROBOT pages from August 29th,
which include writing a journal entry by default.  Again, this
directory and file structure leaves a lot to be
desired. <a href="https://b.robnugen.com/robot/2019/">https://b.robnugen.com/robot/2019/</a></p>

<p>I want to have OCR determine the dates of the pages and rename the
files based on those dates.  I have considered posting each page in
this journal stream, but I think it would be better to make an RSS
feed of them (but it would not get updated with each scan (if it was
tied only into this repo of entries)).  It should be a different RSS
feed, built just for b.robnugen.com</p>

<pre><code>Thanks Emmanuel

Getting a slot on my site is pretty expensive; low-end is around
20k, but you can go up from there if you want a top page slot.

Let me know

<p>Lily had not seen the
<a href="http://mt3s.robnugen.com/">(silent) video snippets for Marble Track 3</a>,
so I sent her a link on LINE after we finished looking at her study
material.  I told her about cases of normally countable words used as
adjectives, (e.g. &ldquo;He has a 3 year old.&rdquo; vs &ldquo;His kid is 3 years old.&rdquo;)</p>

<p>I got AB&rsquo;s DB on RDS, but had it in a different AZ than the server
(oops) which caused some slowness that AB noticed.  I turned on
Multi-AZ and rebooted the RDS instance with &ldquo;failover&rdquo; selected and
now AB&rsquo;s RDS in AB&rsquo;s EC2&rsquo;s AZ makes it noticably faster.  Yay!</p>
