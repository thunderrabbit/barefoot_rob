<p>I don't remember much from Yesterday or Wednesday.  Just that I
went on a letter writing spree.  I caught up when I finished Robin's,
Aaron's, Amanda's and Cheri's today.  I have also been reading

<p class=date>Sunday June 14, 1987 10:45PM.</p>

<p>The Rally was excellent!  OK..  I left Friday at about 5:00PM.  I
picked up Dad at his office.  Then he drove us to the church.  When we
got there only Liz Benjamin and official people were there- no youth.
I was looking through the registration forms and I saw Kelly Hugget's
so I thought "It will be great".  Then Aaron and Mike and the rest of
Austin showed up.  "Hey dude" "Yeah" Hugs "Oh, man, how ya doin'?"
Then Baton Rouge came.  I ran to hug Bryn.  So then we started
unloading clothes and food and stuff.  Then Oklahoma people came.
Alisa came in and she was holding some food.  I was gonna be first to
hug her but she sorta pushed on through.  Then someone said, "you can
hug me."  I looked up and it was Kelly!  MMMM Hug Hug Kiss Kiss Oh
<em>baby</em>.  I found out if I hadn't sent the registration forms to
Kelly that all of Tulsa would not have come.  Wow.  After people were
settled, we played some games.  We were swatting a beach ball around.
We played volleyball.  That was fun.  Girls against boys.  That was
when I sorta met Christi.  She is not beautiful, but very pretty.
Hair, eyes, smile.  She reminds me of Irene from Xanth novels.
Slightly spoiled, but that's a bad word for it.  She is firm and
tough (seems to be) she also flirts a lot and seems to know what she
wants.  I Love her.  Some people would think she is an absolute bitch.
She is perfect.  Another thing we did was get lined up by
birthdays. I was between Bryn and Stephanie? (sp?)  Then we divided up
by our signs.  Aires, Taurus, etc.  We made chants for our sign.  Ours
was "Your a hoser, You'll never win.  If your not Arien.  A-I-RES
Never settle for anything less."  In our group:  Me, Shawn, Stephanie,
Karina?  It was cool.  Then we divided up:  Dog lovers here Cat lovers
there.  Each group would huddle and pick a place and a profession.
then we lined up.  One team would take a step forward and say "Here we
come."  The other team would step toward them and say "Where are you
from?"  1st team would say their place.  2nd team "What's your trade"
1st "Lemonade" On the step forward for lemonae, the teams are lined up
facing eachother about 3-5 feet apart.  Then the first team acts out
their profession.  The second team guesses what it is.  When they are
right, 1st team runs back to their base.  2nd team tries to tag them
whoever is tagged switches teams.  Some of the places: East L.A., New
York, Sydney Australia, Idaho, Timbuk2.  Professions:  Firemen,
Librarians, Farmers, Cosmetologists, Tornadoes (mine), Astronauts,
Nothing.  Then we heard the rules and such.  Then Kelly and I went off
to talk.  She found out about bryn.  She also found out about the
ACT.  We talked for a while, then we went to the sancuary.  We were
sitting by the piano.  She played something.  It was nice.  Then we
started Frenching.  My dad walked in after a while.  I about shit.
Not embarassed, just dreading what speech he had in mind for me.  That
is one reason to hate having him as a sponser for us.  And think:
he's going to be the main dude at Bayview for us.  Oh Shit!  I won't
be able to do anything!  But Kelly will be there so... well, back to
Rally.  We went back to the main room. Aaron was dancin'/messin'
around in a room so I went in there.  Shawn, Robin, Christi were
there.  We were talkin', dancin', performing? for a while.  Then I
started giving Kelly a massage.  Robin ripped a piece off her shirt.
Now it's a bracelet of mine.  Robin lay down behind me and I started
giving her one, too.  After a while, I motioned for Aaron to give it
to her.  At about 1:00AM, my dad came in and said I needed to go to
bed.  everyone found out about the ACT at that point.  They all wished
me luck and shit.  Kelly escorted me to the sancuary.  We kissed a
little, then I went to sleep. At about 2:00AM, Bryn and Emily came in
and said I had to take my contacts out.  I didn't fully wake up, but
I was conscious.  Finally they left.  Then dad came in at 7:00 I woke
up and took the dumb test. (easy) I spent about 5 hours away from
everyone.  When I got back, everyone was at the zoo.  We went there
and I found them after a while.  I was recieved with a warm welcome.
That was great.  Truly excellent.  I was with Kelly the whole time at
the zoo.  After a while we all met up front again.  We went to the
museum for lunch.  I rode with Alisa and other people.  Kelly sat on
my lap.  Christi sat beside me.  Oooh La La.  At the museum we at
outside.  We had tortillas and watermelon.  Kelly had a whole bunch
of hot sauce and cheese mixed up on her plate.  I got 1 chip and
scooped it all up and ate it.  She was slightly surprised.  We also
fed a squirell (sp).  Also we played with the aerobee some.  A group
of us went into the museum.  I was with Bryn and Kelly the whole
time.  They were both hanging onto me.  Plus Emily followed me, too.
It looked pretty impressive.  One dude with 3 girls on him.   We saw
everything (It is very changed from the way it used to be.) then
left.  I went back with Karina and Kelly and someone else.  After we
got back, we started preparing for the Love Feast.  Marabian (sp) Love
Feast.  It was great.  A whole lot of food was layed out on four
tables.  Fruit, vegetables, meat, sandwiches.  All was cut into bite
sized pieces.  There were a few rules concerning eating though.  No
forks, knives or spoons.  Just wooden skewers.  Also no talking.  And
you can't feed yourself.  It was great.  Pretty messy, too.  Christi
was tossing grapes up in the air for Aaron and me.  I Love that girl.
Actually we batiked shirts before supper I didn't batik. I just
painted a shirt some.  I couldn't think of anything.  After supper, a
juggler came.  He taught us how to juggle pretty well.  I will learn
how.  After the juggler a lot of people sat on the stage to talk.
Stephanie and Karina were the center of attention.  They told stories
and jokes and stuff.  Then me and Kelly left for a while.  We just
Frenched some.  I gave her a massage.  Then it got very quiet in the
room where everyone had been talking.  We got up to see what was going
on.  Everyone was walking to the sanctuary.  We followed them.  I
don't know what its called, but what we did was fun.  Ok- 2 people
started out talking about something on stage.  Anything.  "Wow this
rollercoaster is fun" or "I can't believe what you did to the car!" or
"I've got you now Darth Vader" <font size="+1">Anything.</font>
Stephanie and Karina started out.  Oh- wait.... Ok 2 people talk about
something.  Then when you get an idea, like they are side by side in
the movies, you say, "Freeze!" Then you go up there and take one of
their places.  And start a new dialouge (sp?): "Hurry, follow that
car!" or "Help! I"m afraid to fly!"  It is a really fun game.  I'll
give some examples of a few that I did:  Two people were sitting
almost face to face. I froze them and went up to them.  They had been
talking about sex.  I said, "Would you hurry up and go.  How are we
gonna play chess if you keep lookin' around?"  Another- They were up
there with linked arms and they other 2 arms in the air.  I froze
them, went up there and said "Rah Rah Rah!"  That one was pretty
funny.  There was one time I was sitting in a chair talking to someone
and Shawn froze it.  He took the other dudes place, "Dad I really want
to be a speed bump." That was hilarious.  I was saying "no no no" Then
my dad came up and took my place, "well if you want to be a speedbump
then you can be one."  Shawn was all "Awww, I don't know, Dad" and my
dad made him lie down and pretended to drive over him to show him what
it would be like.  That was a great game.  After the game, Kelly
dubbed some tapes.  I lay down beside her to wait for dad to go to
sleep.  He finally did, but Kelly wasn't done yet.  So I waited for
her to get done.  She finally did and we went to an empty room.  There
was a big pillow in there.  It was about 2 feet thick in the middle.
It was long enough for me to lay down on it and not hang off the
ends.  And it was wide enough for Kelly to lie down beside
me. Although we were mostly on top of each other.  Actually we just
Frenched for a long time.  10-15 mins.  Then she started
blowing-licking in my ear.  That felt good.  Then I did her.  Then she
did my other ear as I played with her tits.  One time I got a whole
lot of spit on my fingers and started rubbing with that.  Her nipples
got rock hard.  We Frenched some more and more.  Then we sort of fell
asleep together.  That was nice.  Christina woke us up in the
morning.  We got up, cleaned up, signed stuff, got stuff signed, took
pictures, sang songs, hugged, got addresses, gave addresses, hugged,
kissed, hugged, said "Bye" to everyone, and then we left.  I went home
with Dad and Emily.  We got to Northwoods in time for church.  Cheri
and Jenny were not there.  Monday I started writing this entry.  I
also wrote 2 letters - Cheri and Christi - I started Kelly's I
finished Kelly's on Tuesday.  I'm now going to write to Bryn.  Monday
I got <em>It</em> by Stephen King.  I'm on page 172.  We practiced
rifles on Tuesday.  We won't practice again until Tuesday in Two
weeks.  I might go to Ann's house and tell everyone I'm at practice.
I'll have to get my van working right first.  So now it's Wednesday
June 17, 1987 9:25AM.  Later</p>

<p>Yesterday I didn't do much.  I talked on the phone a lot. Cheri
twice.  She said she talks to me more than anyone else on the phone.
that makes me feel pretty good.  Also we both have gotten to be better
friends.  We were cutting eachother down & saying "You know I Love
you."  So we are best friends-set for life.  I tried to call Ann a few
times but I never got her.  Today- RALLY!!!! Houston Rally today!!!!!
Bryn is going!  I just go a letter from her.  And one from Misha!
Cool!  I started getting ready for the Rally today.  I bought some
shorts and shirts and socks.  I am making a big nasty kite.  It's
about 8 feet tall.  Lemme check... 8ft 2in X 6ft 8in wide.  Big
Sucker.  Well I gotta get ready.  I'm going to drive down and pick Dad
up at his office.  I'll write about the Rally after the Rally Bye</p>

<p class=date>Thursday June 9, 1987 12:45AM.</p>

<p>Sunday.  Church.  I drove.  Mom and Dad were not there.  Me,
Jenny, Cheri, Emily.  We talked about how we are going to decorate our
room.  We had some good ideas run around.  Tuesday I went to the mall.
I cashed a $70 check.  I went to Willowbrook.  I bought 3 posters 2
for church 1 for dad.  I bought a Kermit the Frog and Tootsie Rabbit.
I got Marble Madness.  I will probably return that though.  It
stinks.  I bought some junk from <em>of all things</em> that turned
out to be shit. (not really) I won't buy anything but posters from
there again.  Maybe not even that. (posters) I came back with less than
$1-pretty good for me- MONDAY I went looking for a job-Kroger,
Walmart.  Tuesday I applied at Klein's. I hope to get a job at
Klein's.  Tuesday we had rifle practice It was OK.  I really Love it
though.  I went to Lynda's to "practice" after that.  Bull shit- I
went swimming then watched part of Running Scared.  Ann was with me
all the time.  :-) Wednesday I didn't do much until evening.  I went
to Terra's (sp) house.  Tera (sp) Brooks.  Ann was there.  Along with
her sister, Karen.  Erin, Terra's sister was there.  She is about 6.
Terra and Erin get along pretty well.  That is neat.  Tera is pretty.
Erin is cute.  Afterward, Ann went with me to my van to talk.  She
kept apologizing because she was in a bad mood.  I didn't & don't see
why.  She claimed I didn't have fun, but I did.  That was about
10:30. She asked me when my curfew was.  I said 12.  She asked if I
wanted to go to Lynda's.  Darn Right I want to go to Lynda's.  Anyday.
Anytime.  We went.  <em>Time Bandits</em> was on.  When I first got
there I sat in front of Lynda, who gave me a massage.  Ann sat in
front of me.  I gave Ann a massage.  Then Lynda had to go get some
medicine for her momma.  So it was just me and Ann.  We moved to a
wall that I could lean against.  She lay back on me.  Similar to how
Christy did.  We kissed a little, but not much.  I left at about 12.
Ann didn't get up for me or anything.  So I am still wondering about
exactly how our relationship is.  Ya know- does she care?  or will she
ever?  Did she ever? Or-Does she act like that with everyone?  I'll
maybe ask Lynda.  I got home at 12:15, and everybody was snoozin'.  I
start writing this entry.  I fell asleep.  I woke up and started on
the line with the smile on it on the other page with "Wednesday."  Dad
just called to get me up and going.  He asked how I was and how my date
was.  He thinks I went to see "The Untouchables" ha!ha!  Well bye

<p>Yesterday I didn't practice rifles at all.  My arms were sore
today, too.  Yesterday I went riding around on my bike.  I went to
Dave's house.  We talked a little and discussed girls.  He is going
with Cindy Gilbertson right now.  By the way - on the last day of
school - page before this in blue - Dave drove me Cindy and a girl
named Dawn home.  Dawn sat in my lap.  Which reminds me: Thursday I
picked Fred up from Show-Biz Pizza.  On the way there, this girl
called 93Q and asked them to play <em>I want your Sex</em>.  The DJ
goes: Well I guess you like sex.  She goes "Yeah!  I Love it!
Remember someone's got to do it." ... Wow! dude!  I was like Alright!
On the way home, I went throught some back roads, and stuff.  It
happened to be the same route Dave and I took on our bikes.  It was 10
miles - about.  And we went round trip on our bikes.  Over 20 miles in
one day!  Cool.  Well back to yesterday.  I didn't practice, but I
rode around and went to Dave's.  Ok.  Today I woke up at 6 and went to
take my SAT.  It wasn't too hard.  I met a girl, Ede, from Klein Oak.
I also met a dude from CyCreek and a dude drom Klein.  Pretty cool.
Ede knew some people that I knew from 7th-8th grade orchestra - Chris
Huston, Matt Ramesy.  She also knew Carmen Ticshe(sp). After the test,
I went to Rifle Practice.  It started at 3 and went to 5.  It was
supposed to end at 7.  Only Me, Joe, Kelly, Linda, and Angie were
there.  Keesha had strep throat- I do too, but I haven't told anyone-
And Ann went to see the play CATS. In practice Lynda got sick and
nearly threw-up.  She was truly scared because she says she never gets
sick, or anything.  I just sat down beside her while we all took a
siesta out of the sun.  I drove Lynda home and then took Scott back to
the school to get her car.  I stayed at their apartment for a while.
It is a very laid back environment.  Scott was smoking a pipe with
Lynda's mom there.  Lynda's mom said I have nice legs and that I should
wear short shorts instead of walking shorts or JAMS. Lynda and I went
swimming.  That was nice.  She asked me what I thought of Ann.  I said
I liked her alright.  Lynda said Ann was very interested in me and
Lynda is still trying to figure out if Ann is serious or not.  Lynda
said something about Ann acts like that when Richard is around because
Ann used to be going with Richard.  Or something to that effect.  Then
we went in at about 6:30. I found out that Lynda Loves skor bars.  I
will keep that in mind.  But I'm going to get her to love me before
I'm done.  I have yet to figure out if Scott and Buster are Lynda's
brothers or not.  I don't think Scott is because Lynda and Scott went
together once.  I guess I'll ask her mom to find out.  Well that's
about all.  Bye Bye Good Night.  9:43PM overandout</p>

<p>Tuesday The Rifle corps practiced.  It was tough.  I LOVE IT!  I
will be so strong while I'm on the rifle line.  After practice, I went
to Lynda's to swim.  Ann was there.  We practiced on rifles for a
little then we swam.  Scott Smith and some dude with a wide head was
there.  Ann was hanging on me the whole time nearly.  I made a pretty
good impression on everyone there.  Near the end I was just hugging
Ann close to me to keep her warm.  She seemed very secure.  That's a
good sign.  Wednesday I practiced with my rifle for a while. Then Dave
came over and we went to see Nikki, who is in the hospital with
arthritis in her right arm.  Then I practiced some more with I got
home.  Today, I practiced some and smacked the top of my hand so I
quit for now.  I will go out again later. Tomorrow I won't practice
much at all.  Maybe none to give my arms a rest.  I can warm up before
practice Saturday.  Now I am waiting for a return phone call from Dr
Nair's office.  I might be able to get a job there- typing in stuff on
their computer.  That will be cool.  Well that's about all.  ByeBye.

<p>Yesterday The rifle corps "practiced" from 1 to 3 PM.  Then I went
home.  But not after planning to go to a movie with Anne and Lynda.
Anne picked me up at 6:40.  We went to pick up Lynada [sic] and her
date, who unfortunately wasn't me.  We went to Lowe's and saw Secret
of My Success.  It was pretty good.  During the whole thing Anne and I
were holding eachother.  It was nice, but nothing spectacular.  On the
way home, Anne dropped Lynda off at Richard's house.  I hope she had
fun.  Then Anne took me home.  We didn't kiss or nothing so I guess it
will be at least a while before I can get her.  Today I woke up early,
and got my license.  I'm legal now.  Yea!  The test was incredibly
easy.  I lost 10 points.  30 was the limit.  There was a very pretty
girl in front of us in line.  Kelly Potter.  Kiss Kiss I wish.  I
could snag her if I had more time.  Well that's all.  Bye Bye</p>

<p>I am out of school.  I am a senior!  I passed Spanish final with a
72.  I got an 86 in History for the last 6 weeks.  That's great!  I
thought I failed.  Maybe we will grab that room in church today.  Good
Night.</p>

<h1>Most Illinest, Illinest, Illinest Me</h1>

<p class=date>9:50 PM May 27, 1987 Wednesday</p>

<p>Finals start tomorrow.  I have not studied worth shit.  Literally
less than an hour collectively for all my classes.  I think I may
die.  Cheri called today.  That did little good for my studying.
Lynda came up to me in the hall today.  That means she notices
me. Good.  Sex appeal.  Bryn wrote to me.  At the end she drew a
little sign that said "Bryn +" Then she wrote fill in the blank.  I'll
put "Robert =" and write fill in the blank.  Give her the hard stuff.
Make her confess.  She's only a Freshman.  Gee whiz.</p>

<p>God, I feel so dumb for not studying.  FUCK the World!!
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SHIT!!!  I will
not cheat, though.  Good Night.  Wait!  I got an 80 on my English
paper.  Remember?  The one on the Shuttle.  I got a 79 on the main
part of the Alg II final.  I will bring that up, though.  Good Night
now. 10:00.00 PM</p>

<p class=date>10:15PM May 25, 1987 Monday:</p>

<p>Today was interesting.  I chipped my tooth in typing.  At home I
had some stuff happen too.  I called Lynda Smith.  We talked about
nothing for a while.  Then I went outside to practice my rifle.  When
I was out there, 3 deer ran by.  Then I heard a loud wailing that
sounded like a sheep.  I ran to it and it was a deer that was being
attacked by 2 dogs.  I ran them off and tried to calm the deer down.
Fred called Stan. We brought the deer back to the house in a
wheel-barrow.  We had it wrapped in a sleeping bag to keep it warm.
When Stan got there, though, it had died.  He autopsied it as hit by a
car to break its leg, then caught by the dogs.  We buried it.  Dad and
mom got rid of the Audi today.  They came home in a new truck.  I have
yet to see it in the light.  Friday Dave will drive us to and from
school.  Dad won't let me drive Thursday.  Oh Well.  Good night.
