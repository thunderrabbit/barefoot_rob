<p>Spanish ruled today!  We began to learn the future tense, and it's
SO EASY!!  Tener = to have.  Tenere' = I will have.  We just add a
different ending for the 5 different conjugations and <em>bang</em> I
will have, you will have, s/he will have, we will have, y'all will
have. (essentially)</p>

<p>Class III is going to be on Mondays.  That's kinda stinky because
my I-group meets on Mondays.  I think I will choose to attend Spanish
and ditch I-group for 8 weeks.  They'll understand.</p>

<p>If Class IV is also on Mondays, I'm not so sure that I'd skip
<em>another</em> 8 weeks of I-group.  But I will ponder that when it's
time.</p>

<p>Been workin' workin' workin' a lot lately.  I logged about 45 hours
last week and 18.5 so far this week.  I know it's not a TON of hours,
but it's a lot for me.  I've been way impressed with how smoothly the
new generic survey things are going in place.  There's a bit of
crunchiness as I figure out how to handle various exceptions, but I
think I've got a pretty good model in place now.  So nice.</p>

<p>Dave sent out emails today to a group of 9 peeps in Singapore who
will be testing the pilot survey for them.  They are actually in the
website as I type - it's already noon-thirty tomorrow their time.</p>

<p>Tomorrow a different survey (which I made) will be piloted.  That's
2 surveys in 2 days.  Incredible compared to 1 survey per 2 weeks.
Plus the second survey has two new question types.  The OG model can
allow surveys to define their own question type.  It's sweet.</p>

<p>It's also bedtime.</p>

<p class=date>5:23am CDT Monday 16 April 2001</p>
<p class=note>(lucid dream)</p></p>

<p class=lucid>The year was 2010 or 2100 I was being chased by
different characters from Santa Claus, then by a Sumo Wrestler, then
by Uncle Sam, then by a fat guy who had stolen my cell phone, then by
a normal guy who was chasing me over water.  I was mostly flying each
time.  I was able to fly faster than last night, but still not able to
run totally away from them.</p>

<p class=dream>Before this dream, I was with YRUU watching an old
video of Duncan being silly on stage, performing for the whole
community, and Nathan was performing as well.</p>

<p class=lucid>Scene shifted to the future-dream.  The sense while I
was being chased was I knew they couldn't hurt me, but I was still
flying away from them.  It was partially because the point was to fly
away, and partially I was scared.  At the end, I decided to fly upward
as far as I could, and wondered how it would be if I flew to the moon,
or at least to the upper atmosphere, which wouldn't take as long.</p>

<p class=lucid>Santa Claus was chasing me down a hallway, and the Sumo
Wrestler joined him.  I escaped by flying down the hallway and
outside, but then immediately two guys were waiting for me at the end.
They were hiding outside on either side of the tube, and I got out
before they could lock me in.  Outside, Uncle Sam was chasing me, and
then some fat guy and my friends said, "pat him down; he took your
cell phone."  As if I was going to frisk this guy who wanted to get
me.  I flew up away over some water, alternately using my jet engine
power out my feet and flapping my arms as if treading water.</p>

<p>After my dream, my awareness shifted back into my body smoothly.  I
became aware of my breathing, but it didn't change.  This was not the
same as being conscious while my body was sleeping, but similar
kinda.  I believe my transition from asleep to awake was undetectable
by someone just by watching me.  Probably they would have detected a
shift in brainwave patterns if they had been monitoring that.</p>

<p>Oh! I suddenly remember more.</p>

<p>Before all that chasing flying stuff:</p>

<p class=dream>In a cafeteria; we had been at this facility for about
a week, and a few nights ago, many of the people who were to become my
friends and peers, had over to dinner their siblings or other
relatives with down's syndrome, or something.  They were interacting
and talking and playing, but I really felt uncomfortable.  I didn't
have such a person, and I was thankful; I don't know "how" to act
around "them."  I realize this is a form of racism (yes racism,
stereotyping due to outward appearances), but I feel uncomfortable
because I don't know what "they" might do or how "they" might act.
Actually, this is where the chasing started.  I was running away from
this and then being chased by the different characters, and that's
when it became lucid.</p>

easter</p>

<p>super great fun with YRUU at the park today. 
tossed the  disc around and then played a crazy three
team ultimate gamme.  2  on 2  on 2.  Me and Amy, Matt
 and Katy, Ryan  and a  kid named Zach who happened 
out  to the park and played with us.   Each team had a
different goal, and each team had to start in their
back court, opposite their goal.  When a turnover
occurred,  the first other team  to recoer  got the
disc.</p>

<p>Amy and I got 2  points to their 0 and 0
respectively.  Then a friend of Zach's joined their
team and we didn't get the next point - Matt and Katy
did.   Then Ryan called 'one more point'.'  Afeter a
long battle, Amy and I got it.</p>

<p>got a drink and then chilled  out in the shade of
the ppaillion where Ryan performed a renditioon of
that song that hollers 'say it ain't so woah a whoah
my  life is a cyclone'  or something.  Hey it's not my
fav. kind of music.</p>

<p>And then he played a made up sog for SMom, which
was 'all she expected and less'</p>

<p>The ice cream man arrived, drawing a throng of
peeps out of the park and we munched, then left. 
Super great funday on a lovely Sunday.</p>

<p>At the very end, SMom  presented me with a potted
plant the name of which  I have forgotten, but it's
the kind they mke leis with in Hawaii.</p>

<p>On the  way to Molly and Will's house,  I listened
to Handel's Messaih, and am  impressd with how much I
recognize I've heard before.  Must be a petty popular
tune. ;)</p>

<p class=date>7:41am CDT Sunday 15 April 2001</p>
<p class=note>(lucid dream)</p></p>

<p class=lucid>Being chased by two bad guys, I  tried to fly away from
them.  I knew I should be able to fly, but I wasn't quite able to fly
100% anywhere I wanted to go.  I could fly almost well.  I flew
slowly, as if the air were viscous, keeping me from getting the speed
I needed to fly.  I sank slowly toward the ground like a partially
filled helium balloon.</p>

<p class=lucid>But I needed to be able to fly!  The bad guys were
chasing me.  Not like a "we're going to kill you" way, but in a
harrassing way, like the bullies on Simpsons.  I tried to use
rocket/jet power through my feet to fly away, and tried to shoot them
with machine gun cadence through my fists.  Neither were effective
against these guys.</p>

<p class=lucid>So I used the biggest weapon I had against them.  The
one that always works, but gives me an unfair advantage over them. I
woke up.</p>

<p class=note>(written on my Handspring Visor and
Targus Stowaway Keyboard)</p>

<p>I'm chillin' in the Ray Courtyard at Rice, ready to
help with the Outdoor Show.  I wrote to Abi yesterday
and said I could help as early as 8am.  She said to
just meet her at the Ray Courtyard at 8; that she
would be there.</p>

<p>False.</p>

<p>I called the station and he said that Michael K was
up there, but that he hadn't seen Abi.  'I'm sure she
or someone will be there soon.</p>

<p class=date>8:25 am</p>

<p>True.  Meg.  Abi, Michael just showed up.</p>

<p class=date>11:06 am</p>

<p>We've pretty much moved outside most of the CDs and
T-shirts for sale.  4 tables and 8 or 9 bins full of
CDs on the ground.  U2  is being pumped through the
speakers in a soundcheck type way. </p>

<p>Oh -  this is cool-maybe... We have a bunch of
carts with singles on them.  That's a looped magnetic
tape thing - old school KTRU stuff. </p>

<p>Now  they have Rage or someone on the speakers. 
Meg winced as she walked up.  It's not Rage - some
hard rap rock combo.</p>

<p>It's Methods of Mayhem.</p>

<p class=date>1:19 pm</p>

<p>I am having such a good time at the Outoor Show! 
Matty & Mossy are so good.  This is all Allison W. has
to say.</p>

<p>I helped Curtis and Johnny hang signs from trees
and a lamp post.</p>

<p>About 120 people hanging out in this 1 acre area. 
Pretty good turnout.</p>

<p>Between bands he is playing 'Clever' by someone I
don't remember who, but I reviewed the CD!!!!!</p>

<p>I don't know what I'm talking about; I'm just going
to shut up and lick my ice cream.
<br>- Mondro</p>

<p>Free FREE!!!  Amy's Ice cream!!  They brought about
6 gallons I'm guessing.</p>

<p class=date>1:25 pm</p>

<p>Next band is starting.  I can already tell I'm not
going to like them and they are only doing
soundcheck.</p>

<p class=note>(the rest of this was written on 25
April from memory)</p>

<p>So the show was pretty chillin' relaxed fun.  I
described it later as "flawless" to the KTRU peeps who
asked me about it.  Really it was.  Everyone had a
great time and all the bands showed up and played. 
Free Amy's Ice Cream on top and I call it
flawless!</p>

<p>I got to sit by Meg for a while and talk YRUU stuff
with her, and with Ellen and update her on all the
latest YAC happenings in the district.  Totally great
to connect with each of them.</p>

<p>I got to play frisbee with Mondro, using my magic
magenta-in-UV-white-otherwise frisbee from Centex,
plus a couple of other discs.  We didn't play super
long cause the sun was blazing hot, and the ground had
lotsa lotsa lots of sticker/crab grass.  Yeouch on the
bare feet!</p>

<p>I talked to a couple of kids (11-13 years old
probably) as they were digging through the old CD
bins.  They came across some of the CDs I had donated
- Tiffany, Debbie Gibson, um,.. some others.  Anyway,
they were all halfway "you're weird" and halfway
"wow!" when they found out they had been my CDs.  They
were funny.</p>

<p>I watched up close a band play, including a weird
cool string instrument, the name of which I have
forgotten.  I had never seen one before.  About 5 feet
long with about 8 or 10 strings, each of which was on
a bridge that could move, changing the tone of the
strings.  She played with by plucking or scraping or
tapping and/or pulling the strings at the same time. 
Very cool.</p>

<p>About 1/2 way through the show I had to split for a
family day.</p>

<p>Meg had joked, "Family Day?  Like what have they
ever done for you?"</p>

<p>I laughed with her - and really really hoped that
family day would take my mind off of missing KTRU.</p>

<p>It didn't. It sucked.  Click next to find out.</p>

<p>This all happened yesterday after I left the Outdoor Show early at
like 3:15pm to come home and spend time with my dad, his girlfriend
Karen, and her daughter Elise (pronounced more like "Alisa").</p>

<p>Actually, background information:  For Christmas my dad asked for
dinner with Wende and me once per month.  Quality time.  Absolutely
beautiful meaningful gift.  No problem.  ...  Except that Wende and I
keep ourselves pretty busy; it was difficult to squeeze in more than
just a dinner on occasion.  So in March, we scheduled dates for the
next 3 months.  April 14, May something and June something else. (oh
shit today is the day before taxes are due, and I haven't sent in our
investment club taxes)</p>

<p>My dad called a few days ago and said that the dinners of just hug,
eat eat eat, hug, bye! were not quite as meaningful, filled with
quality time as he had originally envisioned.  He was right; the
dinners certainly seemed like one more thing to do than relaxed
quality time with family.</p>

<p>But yesterday was the KTRU Outdoor Show at Rice.  Noon to 8pm of
bands and fun chillin' in the sun.  All free.  I pretty much really
really didn't want to miss this; it's the biggest KTRU event of the
year.  But, for my dad, for relaxed quality fun laughter games like
Sorry! or Parcheesee (sp), Scrabble.. okay.  I'll miss part of the
Outdoor Show.  I'll leave early and be home by 4pm.</p>

<p>Dad, Karen, Elise arrived just as we were done getting ready.
Lovely timing.  Dad and Karen cooked dinner as I slept on the living
room floor, then sat by Elise looking through ridiculously expensive
catalogue, talk talk whatever.  Then dinner, which was great (the
salad had a bit too much weird lettuce and stuff for me) and fresh cut
fruit for dessert.</p>

<p>We cleared the table put all the dishes in dish washer and then I
set up the table for games; I put Scrabble on it.</p>

<p>But they had to leave.</p>

<p>What?  WHAT???  The Fucking KTRU Outdoor Show is just now finished
meaning I can't go back to see the end, and you guys are fucking
LEAVING???  What happened to the desire for quality time??  I wouldn't
have fucking slept on the floor while you were cookin'!  I woulda
helped!  What happened to wanting to play games?  I REally would have
fucking appreciated being told BEFORE I LEFT my friends to come see
you just leave!!!</p>

<p>I was pissed.  Visions of smashing something - throw the computer
monitor out the window maybe, or dump the table over and throw
Scrabble in an explosion of letters across the room.  I was Butch
without his gold watch.</p>

<p>But instead of acting on these impulses, I used the protocol I
learned in I-group, and teach to people when appropriate.</p>

<p>"I feel angry, because I left the Outdoor Show to come play with
you guys, and I expected to play games, but now you're leaving.  I
want.. I would have wanted to know of your plans before I left my
friends."</p>

<p>"Let's take a walk."</p>

<p>Outside, my dad and I talked.  He thanked me for being able to
express my anger clearly and cleanly.  He said he was (in general)
having trouble asking for what he wanted or needed of people.  He
didn't make clear to me what he..</p>

<p>whatever; I don't know. nevermind.  That's his work.</p>

<p>The point is that we decided to schedule a time for just he and I
to hang out and play a game.  Maybe Stratego, which we used to play
when I was 7 or 8 or 10 or something.  We haven't played that for
<em>years.</em></p>

<p>I was un-pissed.  Yeah, I missed 1/2 of the Outdoor Show, but life
is still good.</p>

                        <p class=date>7:20am Friday the 13th of April 2001</p>

<p>I got woken up by peeps at work: "what did you
change last night?  The website is locked."</p>

<p>Apparently, visitors to *any* part of our website
have to enter a username and password and domain. 
Weird.  The only thing I messed with last night was
adding the email extraction mechanism.  Nothing to do
with the website.</p>

<p>However(!), I did notice the password thing when I
opened the web browser to send an email from my Yahoo!
email account.  The homepage on the browser is our
work homepage - it asked for a password, but I ignored
it because I was on a machine that's part of our DMZ
and I ass-u-med that it was okay.</p>

<p>That was about 7pm last night.  Doh.  That means
none of the cats in Singapore were able to do any
testing on our website on their Friday, which just
ended.</p>

<p>The <em>only</em> thing that comes to mind is that
Minh said he was going to try to break into our site
from the outside, the way a "hacker" might.  I wonder
if something got fucked up in that process, or if he
even did it last night.  Hmmm.</p>

<p>Last night Wende and I joined Chad et. al. from her work to see <a
href="https://www.otnemem.com/"><em>Memento</em></a> (the flash portion
of the site is pretty tight).  At first I
didn't like the movie; I was anticipating seeing imagery of him losing
his wife, and I really didn't want to see that.  But by the end of the
movie I was left wondering WTF?? and really am still not quite sure
what we "reality" in the movie.</p>

<p>I doubt my questions are enough to make me see it again, except
maybe on rental later.</p>

<p>I found several user sites on the movie <a

<p class=dream>Wende and I at a restaurant which we frequented and saw
a new theater next door.  We wondered how they could compete in the
movie theater market, and then noticed their gimmick:  Free chips, all
one can eat.  Outside the theater were big garbage bags full of chips
for people to take into the theater.  People wouldn't finish them, so
the bags would go back outside, ready for the next peron to munch.</p>

<p class=dream>We had gone to get our tickets exchanged at a different
theater for a movie that we did not get a chance to see.</p>

<p class=dream>When we got back to the restaurant atfter attending the
free chips theater, Marcel was at our booth.  I gave him five and he
was talking to Kayse on cell-phone speaker-phone.  People were all,
"it's a good thing you weren't here for their conversation [because it
was so lovey-dovey sappy]."</p>
