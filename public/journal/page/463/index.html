<p>On the way leaving the church, Fred and I engaged the abortion
clinic protestors in coversations.  I talked mostly to a cat named
Ryan and it was interesting.  I got my point across that I don't
believe what he believes since it amounts to an infinite punishment
for a finite sin.</p>

<p>Fred basically shut down his guy's arguments with Fred's huge
mathematical mind.  Fun.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>At Fred's apartment now, and I don't know where my computer power
supply is.  It seemed to be missing from my bag last night (this
morning) when Katy was taking SF notes, and the battery said 46% so I
went to find the power supply and didn't find it.  Hmmmm.  Couldn't
find it this morning, and don't find it at Fred's.  Last place I for
sheezy had it was at Fred's school.  After a smoothie each, we're
going to go look there.</p>

<p>Then we'll hang out with Ma tonight.  On me-an-Fred's way home,
some guy who may have been Jon honked at me from what could have been
Jon's car.  Hmmm.  It's <em>*possible*</em> that Jon will have an
extra power supply for Mac, or know an inexpensive place to get one
locally.</p>

<p class=date>6:13pm</p>

<p>Nevermind.  It was in the computer lab where I had been plugged
in.  When I unplugged it from the back of my computer, the cord fell
to the floor and I didn't notice it to put into my bag.</p>

<p>Fred's eyes have been crying mostly all day possibly as a result of
his contacts.  He's put them in and taken them out and rinsed and
everything.  Now he's snorting snot due to tears pouring out his eyes
and staring at the computer screen from only 4 inches away since he
has no contacts in now.</p>

<p class=date>8:00pm</p>

<p>We've been working on the new index for my journal.  I say we and
mean Fred; he's the brains behind this operation.  Now it correctly
displays 1997 and 1998 stuff.  Still haven't fixed the 1996 entries
(nor any others that are .txt files which need to be wrapped in
&lt;pre&gt; tags.</p>

<p class=date>9:44pm</p>

<p>Chillin' at Ma's house now, and Jon said that Schlotzky's has a
five mile radius on their wireless internet connection.  Fantastic.
I'm so proud of them for paving the way to free wireless connections
all over the place.</p>

<p class=date>9:59pm</p>

<p>Driving now, got the AirPort on, but no signal yet.</p>

<p>Ma has moved into Jon's house and has been given permission to give
away some of his stuffed pigs.</p>

<p>Fred scooped some of them up to add to his pile of stuffed animals
on his bed.  Jon, being all melodramatic was all, "oh I know he going
to use them to wash his car.... or sell them as tampons to people."</p>

<p>Me: "Pigpons..."</p>

<p>Jon: "Hahah yeah, for fat people!"</p>

<p>HAHAHahahhahahaha</p>

<p class=date>10:04pm</p>

<p>Welp, we just drove by the Schlotzky's but got no signal.  We're on
the street within a few hundred yards of the place (direct line of
sight and all that) and got nothin'.  Ah well; it will work
someday.</p>

<p class=date>11:28pm</p>

<p>Ate at Trudy's.  Good stuff.  There's another Schlotzky's near
Trudy's but still no wireless ethernet.  Super thanks to Ma for her
willingness to pay the whole meal.  :-)</p>

<p class=date>12:55am</p>

<p>I slept for a bit at Jon's while Fred and Jon yakked (talked, not
vomitted) about whatever and stuff.</p>

<p>I'm driving to Austin today, to attend the First UU lock-in
tonight.  Ironically, the Houston youth are having a lock-in tonight,
which I would love love love to attend, but I already committed to the
Austin group before I heard about the Houston lock-in.</p>

<p>I'm closer on putting my new journal thing online.  You can beta
test it at <a
href="/cgi-local/journal.pl">https://www.robnugen.com/cgi-local/journal.pl</a>.
<a href="mailto:freaky_journal@robnugen.com">Let me know</a> if you
see anything freaky, not including that it doesn't properly display
1996, 1997, nor 1998 entries.</p>

<p class=date>1:16pm</p>

<p>Aight.  I'm in Austin.  It took me 12 minutes to get into Fred's
building cause I had the correct door code, but didn't know I have to
turn the door knob counter clockwise instead of clockwise.  Silly
door.  Fred pretty much hates the design of the door latch.  It
requires the use of two hands: 1 to turn the knob and the other to
pull the handle.  The knob is too small to realistically grasp and
pull hard enough to open the door.</p>

<p>We're listening to the soundtrack of Star Wars Episode I: The
Phantom Menace</p>

<p class=date>3:29pm</p>

<p>Fred and I laughed at some Eminem songs; they are just so perverse
and funny!  Fred hadn't really heard any Eminem stuff.</p>

<p>Drank smoothies and ate sandwiches, both lovely creations of
Fred's.  Excellent stuff.</p>

<p>Rode bikes to his school; I made a truck hit his brakes hard enough
to skid, but I didn't get in his way; I just looked like I was going
to.  Bike lane the rest of the way and now he's doing Fred stuff, and
I'm ripping CDs, scanning for viruses, working on my journal.pl</p>

<p>At Austin YRUU lock-in now.  They have just been gossipping about
school and YRUU for an hour, while chowing on pizza and cookie dough
and gooey cookies.</p>

<p>Now they have chosen the name/theme of the Austin Rally 2003, one
of the first that I will miss:  Spork vs. Foon.  I suggested Lyle
Luau, which was the theme of Austin Rally 1996, and YRU Conning Me,
which was the theme of Houston 1997.  Fun thing is that no one but me
knew that.  How amazing the speedy turnover of YRUU.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Before the lock-in Fred and I rode our bikes to his school so he
could move his junk from old office to new office, and so I could get
online.  Then rode back to his apartment, I showered, and we then we
rode to church, which was pretty hot.</p>

<p>K B-H just whipped off her shirt ("I've got a bra on!") and then
their DRE Andrea came in.  "HI Andrea!"  It's a black bra; looks kinda
like a bathing suit top.</p>

<p>Cyan (pronounced "sigh on") has red, pink, white toe socks on, with
little cats on the bottom of the big toes.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Funny quotes:</p>

<p>"What's worship?"</p>

<p>"It's what we're going to do in about 2 or 3 hours."</p>

<p>"Oh, that candle thing?"</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>"Wow, your legs are remarkably smooth."</p>

<p>"OH MY GOD!!  It must be guys who are named Ian!"</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>"Here's one in case you need two."</p>

<p>"Isn't embezzle like the cutest word in the world?  It's like
<em>embezzle</em> and you just want to squeeze it."</p>

<p>"I think that should be your indian name 'Dances With Dowel
Rod.'"</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>"The doors are all locked, so if we go outside, take me with
you."</p>

<p class=date>10:16pm</p>

<p>Interesting now the dynamics of the group - there is one person
trying to set up to watch a movie, and I'm encouraging Katy to
consolidate the group so we can play some bonding games.  Right at
this moment, the male youth are engaged in carrying a small white
couch into their YRUU room.</p>

<p class=date>10:18pm</p>

<p>Movie is starting; we seem to be in this room and Katy seems to
have lost energy.</p>

<p class=date>12:53am</p>

<p>We delayed the movie until now by playing games: one round of duck
duck goose; one full game of Fuzzy Duck, which resulted in one person
saying "Duzzy Fuck" and a whole pile of people in the middle of the
circle; several rounds of Fruit Basket; several rounds of Captain
Video; some rounds of Big Booty; some rounds of Murder In The
Dark.</p>

<p>Then we had a short worship starring Ian doing the shortest guided
meditation that I've ever experienced.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Now we're watching Heavy Metal (the movie)</p>

<p>Katy B-H here.. so we&rsquo;re watching heavy metal&hellip; which is full of
freaky cartoon sex scenes&hellip;&ldquo;getting a little too excited for church!&rdquo;</p>

<p> I'm just waiting for it to be over so we can play silent
football... which should be fun since most of these kids have never
played, and a few have never even heard of it.</p>

<p>"She's like Queen Arthur!"</p>

<p class=dream>I was at next year's SWUUSI and youth were just
arriving.  I didn't know all their names, but I remembered many.  They
wanted to honor Gram Wilson-Cain by carrying him on the shoulders of
the crowd like in the movie Shrek.</p>

<p>I'm going to drive my car to Wende's then ride my bike downtown.
Wende's is close to downtown, and I can shower afterward.</p>

<p class=date>1:42pm</p>

<p>Rode all over downtown, focusing on the new METRORail that's being
built.  Got lots of pictures of various sections in various stages of
construction.  Super fun riding all around.  Got water at the YMCA, at
UH Downtown, and First UU Church on Fannin.  The bridge in front of
UHD is being rebuilt, or at least part of it is being rebuilt for the
train.</p>

<p class=date>3:37pm</p>

<p>I'm at Paint This! now after picking up the unicycle from the
Schwinn shop next door.  I finished the plate that I started on 19 May
of this year, and have been watching the storm coming in from the
north.  The unicycle wasn't fixed, but Jeff showed me what he thought
needed to happen to it.  I called Scott, who owns the uni and I'll
bring it to him before anything else is done to it.</p>

<p class=date>5:09pm</p>

<p>I have dropped off the unicycle to Scott (the person, not my car),
and feel thankful to have that completed.  It didn't feel like I could
get the option to continue borrowing it (it's been 2.5 years so far),
so he has it now.  I had hoped he would have a welder to fix it and
then offer to let me keep it a bit longer, but it will go into Scott's
pile of Things To Do.  Fair enough.</p>

<p>I have just dropped off Scott (my car, not the person) at the shop
to check all his fluid levels before continuing my adventure tomorrow.
I'm chillin' at Kinko's near my ex-work and ex-apartment.</p>

<p>I just watched Coaster Rush Week on the travel channel, and it
appears that I should make a visit to Cedar Point in Sandusky Ohio,
and possibly to Busch Gardens in Virginia.  Maybe 2 days at Cedar
Point.</p>

<p>Abbey said Cedar Point was relatively close to where she lives, so
maybe I can use her place as a base.</p>

<p>Bedtime for me now.</p>

<p class=dream>Out by a curb meeting two kids on the street.  One of
them was all, "Joe," or something and I asked the other for his name
and he  took a breath and said, "Chapsanova."</p>

<p class=dream>"Spell it," I said, then "oh wait.  I got it."</p>

<p>Hung out with Jason this morning; after synchronizing my email and
ripping Dr Dre's Chronic 2000 CD and some Eminem from Marshall
Mather's LP we ate brunch at an indian food place, and then rode my
bike and his unicycle around his street.  I tried to ride the uni by
holding the seat out in front of me, but I couldn't get that to work
too well.  I got about 1 revolution max.</p>

<p>We got hot and went inside.  Jason showered while I listened to my
new music.  His frien Caryn came over and we all hung out on his couch
with Caryn listening (and sometimes stunned) as Jason and laughed our
asses off telling old YRUU stories.  Funny funny shit about cursing in
front of the lunch ladies at the Biological Station at SWUUSI one
year, after which the director of the station wrote to the director of
SWUUSI a letter about how we were all going to hell and needed to find
god.</p>

<p>Good stuff.  Laughing about how Bryan Beck went into a giggly
coniption on the floor after chugging a 2 quart thing of Surge and
snorting a pixie stick.  How he walked out one door and immediately
walked in the door 100 feet away.</p>

<p>We tried some of our dancing double stunts, but were unable to get
any of them to fully work.  Caryn was understandably nervous as we
were attempting all this shit on his ceramic tile floor.  We aborted
our attempts before anyone got hurt.</p>

<p>We were so giggly about stuff that Jason was all, "thanks Rob, now
I'll never see Caryn again..."  and i was all, "hey, at least this way
you won't have to spend a lot of time in the stage of wondering if she
likes you or not.  After today you'll <em>know</em>."</p>

<p>Have been hanging out with Kristen for the past hour or so.  Took
Daisy their little poodle to pick up Jessica from her friend Alexis'
house.  Jessica didn't come outside immediately (even after Kristen
honked her horn) so I walked up to the door with Daisy and when they
came to the door I said, "we found this dog in your neighborhood and
wondered if it was yours...."</p>

<p>Super thanks to Kristen for lunch of chicken and a big noodle shell
thing.  :-)</p>

<p>After saying HI (and bye) to Kristen, I visited Kinko's up near my
ex-apartment.  Then over to La Jaliscience (including making a U turn
in the middle of Main Street near First Church on Fannin, yahoo!) to
have dinner with Wende, whose possessions will be packed by a swarm of
movers tomorrow so she can vacate to San Francisco, where she has an
apartment selected.</p>

<p>Called Suzanne and confirmed I could sleep over at her house
tonight, so after helping Wende that her new 25 inch TV works (it was
still in the box), I drove over to Suzanne's where we just watched
Pearl Harbor when we might have exchanged stories and stuff, but oh
well.  None of us had seen the movie so it's all good.  (None = not
me, Suzanne, nor Trish)</p>

<p>I'm going to stay up and watch more movies a bit via their
satellite.</p>
