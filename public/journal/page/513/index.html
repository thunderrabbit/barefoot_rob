<p>I'm getting excited about the rally.  I've actually already packed;
I chose to pack this morning so I wouldn't have to do it between work
and meeting people to leave.</p>

<p>Um.. Oh at work we had our thanksgiving munch thing - ham and beans
and potato salad.  I didn't gorge.  Oh and we had weird tapioca tea
with tapioca balls at the bottom and a big straw to slurp them up. I
didn't really like the flavor, but the consistency was quite fun.  I
kept 3 of the straws in case they come in handy at the rally.</p>

<p>I've also gone through an exercise in one of the books to compile a
java servlet.  Just learning this stuff.  I get the feeling more and
more that I don't really <em>want</em> to learn it.  This feeling has
been the turning point in some of my past jobs. I remember working at
the pharmacy and being shifted to a new position, and I went through 1
day of training and said "forget it" and I quit.  I'm not exactly at
that stage yet, but the feeling is similar.</p>

<p>I've been talking to Laura N about the possibility of us
coordinating a trip to Europe this summer!  It shall include youth if
it happens (and if any choose to go with us).  Should be tons of
fun!</p>

<p>It's been a slow week this week; I'm clearing out my email box
today and possibly doing some new development work, but I don't have a
specific structured task.</p>

<p>Last night was an amazing storm.  I could hear sleet hitting my
window around 1am.  Totally windy and pouring.  I am exceptionally
thankful for my clean dry warm place to sleep.</p>

<p>I've been working on my marble track recently.  Have added a spiral
staircase on the opposite side.  It's not finished yet, but is being
slowly developed.  I'm not sure how exactly I'll tie it in to the
stuff at the top.  I want to make a ratchet that slowly turns a thing
to make the big marbles switch between tracks every 10 or 15 turns, as
opposed to the other switch which toggles the track each time.  We'll
see how it goes.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is Fort Worth Rally!!  I have put my rally review up for
San An, but there wasn't a whole ton of stuff.  I intend to be faster
with my Fort Worth entries.</p>

<p>This is a semi-canned message from Craig at humanclock.com.
About 2,254,107 seconds ago (ok&hellip;about 26 days), you submitted
11 photos for the website.</p>

<p>Sorry it took so long to get the pictures into the
site.  I had to rewrite all of the code that processes
submissions and puts the photos into the clock&hellip;.but
things are all better now.  Future submissions to the
website will now  only take a few days to put onto the
site, instead of a few eons.</p>

<p>Here is a rundown of what I did with your 11 photos:</p>

<p>(dude_1143.jpg) * put into the website as 11:43 pm *
(dude_1145.jpg) * put into the website as 11:45 pm *
(dude_1151.jpg) * put into the website as 11:51 pm *

(rob_1150_v2.jpg) * put into the website as 11:50 pm *</p>

<p>Quick note concerning accepted photos:</p>

<p>Your photo(s) shares a timeslot with other photos,
so it might not always come up at the specified time.  If
the clock has more than one photo for a given time, it chooses
a picture at random.  If your photo does not come up, hit
reload/refresh on your browser during that minute and it
should come up eventually.  If it doesn&rsquo;t come up at all
when I said it would, write me and tell me I need to write
better code or something.</p>

<p>Fred and I went to a rave thing last night, but we found it not
particularly to our liking.  The music was just some techno-ish stuff
with relatively low beats per minute.  On the order of 60 instead of
100 the way I like.  No jungle beats either.  I wonder how we could
have discerned from the flyer that it wasn't going to be worth our $12
each.</p>

<p>We were there for 2 hours anyway to get our money's worth as best
as possible.  Got home all stinky with sweat and smoke and immediately
tossed it all into the laundry, which was finally done at 5:45am.  I
didn't fold it before sleeping 6 hours.</p>

<p>Today we've stopped by KTRU to fill out a check request form so I
can get paid $35 for the basketball game I did on Saturday.  Oh, that
reminds me, I'll be at KTRU tomorrow night as well, playing actual
music this time.  By "actual music" I mean "KTRU music."</p>

<p>Perl rules.  I'm *hardly* an expert, but I was just now able to
write a web interface to view and modify a text file.  Okay, I had
already written the form, but it had no functionality.  Next I will
add the ability to create a new file and delete a file.  Nice.</p>

<p>Right now though, I'm going to a birthday party at Katharine's.
This is the first time I've been invited to an event of hers.  We'll
see how it goes.</p>

<p>Katharine's party was lovely fun.  Most people drank, but no one
was obnoxiously drunk.  I talked to a guy named Joel who was also not
drinking.  We talked most of the evening until he left.  Played fetch
with Drucilla, Alison's little bite sized dog, and watched Patrick eat
ham.</p>

<p>Obnoxiously late arriving was a guy named Michael whose job
involves him meeting a ton of different celebrities and taking them
different places and whatever they want to do or something like that.
He told a few different stories about a few different famous actors /
artists.  Funny stuff.</p>

<p>He's met Tori Amos and Trent Reznor, but not the Beastie Boys.</p>

<p>Last night I was in the proverbial pits; I did *not* want to be
alone at my apartment.  I wanted to be <em>anywhere</em> than there. I
stayed with the feeling as best as possible.  Played Blockout on my
old computer (with a pullchain for the monitor switch) and went to
sleep.</p>

<p>This morning I worked on my marble track for the first time in over
4 years!  After an hour or so of that I was in the most chipper bouncy
happy mood I've experienced in a *long* time!  So great!</p>

<p>Now I'm going to Wende's and we'll go to Maggie's for munchin' and
such.</p>

<p>Wende and I visited John and Maggie's house for turkey day.
Talked, played video games, played pool.  Will and I found a variation
of pool at which we are equally matched.  He tries to get 8 balls in
the side pockets, while I try to get 8 balls in the corner pockets.
If a player scratches, a ball comes out of their pocket.</p>

<p>We each won 2 games playing that way.  Otherwise, he whomped me at
every other game.</p>

<p>Fred arrived barely in time to eat, and did some of his math
homework while hanging out.  Graduate level Abstract Algebra.  He
tried to explain some of the problems, but I mostly didn't get
them.  He didn't try too hard to explain it all.</p>

<p>Fred told me about Lebesgue integration, with which one can
integrate functions that are discontinuous everywhere, such as the
function where f(x) is 0 for every rational x, and 1 for every
irrational x.</p>

<p>Wow, I say.  Wow.</p>

<p>"But that's not even <em>half</em> of the reason it's cool!
Doesn't even scratch the surface; doesn't even come close to showing
why it's cool!"</p>

<p>Wow, I say.  Wow.</p>

<p>Okay, I'm here at work, and I have one task that has been
irritatingly on my list since the dawn of time and I really don't want
to do it, but it will make my boss really happy.  And I can see the
value, but I still don't want to do it.</p>

<p>The task is to comb through my pile of code and fix all the spots
that cause "uninitialized" "unreferenced" or "WARNING" to appear in
the logs.  When I started coding, no one cared about these.  Now
someone does.  But it's not just this simple task because all the code
is live and we don't have a good mechanism for testing.  We have a
testing box, but not a systematic way to test every conceivable
possible scenario that could occur.  And there is no definitive
authority on what is the live source code for sure.  My solution to
that is just to test the whole operation and move everything online.
I'll need big support or a ton of patience to make sure that is done
completely and correctly.</p>

<p>But we're in a lull now -- very few people hitting our servers, so
now is a good time to mess something up, if that's what's going to
happen.</p>

<p>Or I can just procrastinate some more.</p>

<p class=date>10:44am</p>

<p>Okay, here's my plan:  Instead of fixing all the code and moving
all the stuff online, I'm just going to fix it all on the test box,
and then get support in moving it all online next week.  Aww yeah.</p>

<p class=date>1:15pm</p>

<p>This is going much more smoothly than I hoped.  With Dave and
Minh's help, I am able to pretty quickly check for the offending
messages in the logs.  I've come across only 2 that I've been unable
to solve.  Soon I'll be done and going to Paint This! to paint.</p>
