<p>Now *this* is rain.</p>

<p>I can hear it pelting the shit out of the roof of this train
station.  I saw the dark clouds out toward the direction my train line
goes, so I brought my umbrella.  :-)</p>

<p>how ironic to have such a storm </p>
l.,k,,l,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,kk

<p class=date>5:50pm</p>

<p>doh</p>

<p>I was saying how ironic to have such a storm now *after* the rainy
season has been declared over.  :-)  I love big storms, so I'm
certainly not complaining.   But there's no thunder n lightning.  Just
rain.  But big rain.   Good job, weather.</p>

<p>Just at that moment, while on the train, my phone rang.  I knew it
must be Fumi, and the train hadn't left the station yet.  I lept up
with the phone in one hand, my computer in another hand and my bag in
another hand and jumped toward the closing doors.  I got my bag into
the door </p>

<p class=date>5:52pm</p>

<p>SHIT!</p>

<p>Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck</p>

<p>okay.</p>

<p>... and with both hands, pressed as hard as I could to force the
doors back open.  They relinquished; it wasn't like I did a superhuman
feat; I just got crunched for a bit until they opened.</p>

<p>Talked to Fumi.  "It's raining" "yeah okay, we'll meet in Shibuya
at the end of the Tokaido line."</p>

<p>Looked down at my computer.  It was working, but one of the four
hinge-points on the screen was broken.</p>

<p>Shit.</p>

<p>Got back on the next train.</p>

<p>Couple stations later I was like, "why am I in a tunnel?"  And then
I realized why and wrote "SHIT!" and "Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck"
above.</p>

<p>Wrong train line.  It went down into the subway instead of up to
Shibuya.  Doh!!!</p>

<p>Fumisan called me as I was 5 minutes late and inquired.</p>

<p class=date>6:37pm</p>

<p>Now we are in a restaurant near Shibuya.  Desserts and more
desserts.</p>

<p>Mmmmm. Dessert.</p>

<p>During the last lesson, we suddenly heard all the ceiling tiles
just.. creak a bit as they shifted.  Senses alerted.  Then felt the
gentle shake.</p>

<p>"Earthquake!"  smiles.  Cool.</p>

<p>I stood up to better experience any aftershocks.  There were none.</p>

During a lesson, we heard all the ceiling tiles creak...  it was like
the sound scurried by over our heads from one end of the room to the
other.

*Then* we felt the floor do a quick side to side.  And that was it.   

Cheers or general exclamations could suddenly be heard through the
ceiling, like their sports team had just scored an impressive point.
</pre>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>After the lesson, I saw Benny and was all, "how was that?"
referring to the earthquake.</p>

<p>"Same as always, I take them to the back room and have sex."</p>

<p>"Oh, that was you?"</p>

<p>"What was me?"</p>

<p>"Dude.  There was an earthquake; didn't you feel it?"</p>

<p>"No; I told you we were having sex.  Dammit, I missed an
earthquake?  I always miss them!"</p>

<p>As we were leaving, "Sumika, did you feel the earthquake?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Awesome."</p>

<p>"Scary."</p>

<p>"Was it a big one?"</p>

<p>"Maybe a big one."</p>

<p>Those Japanese like the word 'maybe.'</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Chie, Benny's student, was downstairs texting someone when we
emerged from the building.  Benny prodded her in the shoulder with his
elbow. (she's short)</p>

<p>"Chie, did you feel the earthquake during your lesson with
Benny?"</p>

<p>"My lesson was fun."</p>

<p>"No, there was an earthquake; did you feel it?"</p>

<p>(rabbit in headlights)</p>

<p>"You know," Benny shook his hands "e a r t h q u a k e,"</p>

<p>I punched the word into my translator.</p>

<p>"Honto?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, did you feel it?"</p>

<p>"No I don't feel earthquake."</p>

<p>"Ah okay.  Well there was one.  See you later!"</p>

<p>Did she mean "didn't" or "earthquakes" ?</p>

Temblor jolts Ibaraki Prefecture

An earthquake registering a magnitude of 5 hit Ibaraki Prefecture on
Monday evening and was felt in Tokyo, the Meteorological Agency said.

There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage from the 8:57
p.m. quake. No tsunami warning was issued.

The temblor measured 4 on the Japanese seismic intensity scale of 7
in locations including Mito, Hitachi and Tokaimura in the
prefecture. Intensity-4 quakes can wake up most people, according to
the agency.

Its focus was some 50 km underground in northern Ibaraki, the agency
said.

<p>Bought movie tickets for Aki and I to see Pirates of the Carribean
on Wednesday at 12:45pm.  Wednesdays are ladies' days at theaters
(they get in for only 1000 yen ($8) instead of 1800 yen ($more)) so I
only had to pay 2800 yen for two tix.  Wandered around the guitar
store and marvelled at how much I don't know about guitars nor music
and didn't feel compelled to learn.</p>

<p>Met Satoko at noon and we ate at the nearby high price small
portion restaurant.  A tad uncomfortable at first, but we settled in
to chatting pretty well.  She gave me a little bit of Japanese, but we
mostly yammered in English.</p>

<p>Headed over to KQ around 12:50, walking through the underground
mall, Azalea.  We yammered and I wondered if I should break away from
her so we wouldn't walk into the school together, but I didn't really
worry about it and simply didn't say, "okay, see you in a second" as
we parted at the front desk.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Saw her a second later in a lucky man to man lesson, and we
continued the lesson I had started with her on Friday.  At first she
seemed like a wholly different person - had suddenly become Satoko the
meek Japanese student, instead of just yammer yammer yammer as we had
been doing before.  But whatever; she broke out of that invisible
shell by halfway through the lesson.</p>

<p>My next lesson was an empty sales, so I kinda joined Sumika as she
was chatting with Satoko at the front desk.  We traded some tongue
twisters and theirs seem more difficult than mine.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>After she left, Satoko texted me about something I didn't quite
understand so I asked if she wanted to "hang out (meet) after 9pm" but
she said she couldn't.  Dascoo bro.</p>

<p>Yukiji expressed great disappointment at how long she's been in
level 5: 3 or 4 years.  She zoomed from level 7C to 5 in 2 or 3
years.  Then got stuck in 5.</p>

<p>I gave her my email address.  I wonder if I can help her.</p>

<p class=dream>With some friends near a UU congregational meeting,
with a discussion about money.  I said, "the current system is that we
ask members to give money to individual congregations, and the
congregations are asked to give money to the UUA in order to be a
member of the UUA.  But the only fair way is to not require individual
members to give money, though we still require the congregation as an
entity to give money to the UUA.  This preserves individual liberties,
but still provides money to the UUA, *if* the UUA and separately, the
congregations provide something worthwhile to their members."</p>

<p>I wouldn't have written down this dream, but I woke up as I was
giving my little speech.</p>

<p>The madness in my mind wonders if I've been fired by janette.  I
called twice, and the guilty conscious of mine knows that I wrote what
previously had only been spoken, so when she didn't answer, and hasn't
emailed me recently, I wonder if I'm in trouble.</p>

<p>I hope not; for selfish reasons, I don't want her visit here to
suck; the madness has considered paying her back for an imperfect trip
to Japan.  For positive reasons, I want to remain close; I don't want
to have angered my friend.</p>

<br>sweet sweet<br>
 i hated seeing what you wrote in black and white. (if only you had written in  pink. or blue.)<br>
  i liked it better when things were &ldquo;maybe.  possibly.  probably not, but one never knows!  hmmm, how could this work?  if it did work&hellip;   in the meantime, since we don&rsquo;t know&hellip;.&rdquo;<br>
  it has taken me some time to let the hurt feelings settle and see what the reality is and how to find peace with it.  i consciously did &ldquo;not&rdquo; fire you in my mind or stay in the blaming path when i felt myself wander there.<br>
  i cannot see into the future.  i know what my heart wants most of the time.  i can even see what my heart refuses to see, sometimes.  but i really cannot say for sure what is in my heart. i remember thinking i wanted to marry this one boyfriend i had.  i felt it in my heart that we should be together.  now i thank god i didn&rsquo;t marry that guy. so now i know i cannot be sure what is in my heart. <br>
   this is what i do know. <br>
   <br>
i love you.<br>
even tho i am the one who put it in words,(&ldquo;i know you are not my mate&rdquo;) i feel sad about being rejected.<br>
i choose to love you in whatever way is healthy for me and you. if that means letting you go and finding someone else to play with, so be it. <br>
i don&rsquo;t <em>want</em> to let you go.<br>
i want to play with you.<br>
i love being connected with you. it feels like there is more fun to be had.  more lessons to learn from each other.<br>
my connection to you feels nourishing. the thought of being without you now feels like an emptiness and a loss of joy.<br>
but, when i put it on, it also felt like starting over.  and there is a sense of freedom and strength there.<br>
we are together for a reason. when it&rsquo;s time to part,i will be ok.<br>
i want to have another adventure with you.<br>
if we stay honest with one another, we will be good friends for a long, long time.<br>
i will think of you as a fornow boyfriend, not a forever boyfriend.<br>
i talk too much.<br>
<br>
i heard the phone ring this am and i cried .  the irony is ironical. i have been wanting you to call me  in the middle of the nite.  but i did not answer because my thoughts and emotions were still so raw and jumbled. instead, i waited a while then rode around the lake. and i did not think for a long time.<br>
  the second time you called i was taking jack back to denton.  on the way home, i thought and thought.<br>
  now, i feel better.<br>
<br>
  i want you to stay committed to not having sex with anyone else until i get there.   i will do the same. i am going to have a great time in japan with you. let&rsquo;s face it, we like each other and we know how to have fun. <br>
  then we&rsquo;ll just see what happens.<br>
  ok?<br>
i love you,rob.<br>

<p>Okay, I did a bit of research (oh, I talked to my dad tonight and
that was fun to catch up with him.  We didn't do a full 100% catchup,
but definitely got more than everything is fine) on weather in <a
href="https://www.weather.com/weather/climatology/monthly/77001">Houston</a>
and <a
href="https://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/climatology/monthly/JAXX0085">Tokyo</a>.</p>

<p>According to weather.com, Tokyo gets about 1.5 inches more rain
than Houston per year, though Houston's rain is more evenly spread
throughout the year.  (Tokyo 55.4 inches | Houston 54.0 inches)</p>

<p>Houston is definitely hotter than Tokyo.  The average is 94 F and
93 F in July and August in Houston (I'm surprised that the average in
August is cooler than July), but only 83 F and 87 F in July and August
in Tokyo.  They're only 87 for one month.  We're 90-few for
<em>two</em> months.  So our summer is hotter and lasts longer.</p>

<p>For fun, I looked up <a
href="https://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/climatology/monthly/ASXX0002">Alice
Springs</a>: (avg 96F, 97F, 95F in Dec, Jan, Feb.  Only 12 inches of
rain per year)</p>

<p>(note to self: do not retire in Alice Springs)</p>

<br>What is interesting to me is how the atmospheric and oceanic circulation differences next to Tokyo and Houston result in the precipitation and temperature differences you wrote about&hellip; I go read about it now.<br>

<p>Lesson 1: man to man 7C.  No show.  I had actually prepared
(grabbed pairs of jobs flashcards), but ah well.</p>

<p>Lesson 2: Three level 4 women.  Kinda quiet, but did okay at
speculating the stories behind some funny pictures from _Life Smiles
Back_, a compilations of pics from Life Magazine's famous funny
photos.</p>

<p>Lesson 3: man to man level 4.  She was late, and was wearing some
safari looking outfit.  She goes, "I'm sorry I'm late; I was hunting
tigers."  Turns out we're both programmers.  Traded email
addresses.</p>

<p>Lesson 4: I traded with Benny my three level 5's for his man to man
level 6 guy who he didn't want to teach given the comments in the
file.  I had a nice chat with this cat.</p>

<p>Lesson 5: Two level 7A's.  Chef Masaru and new 7A Midori.  Lesson
was "not much" = "a little" and "not many" = "a few."  They did
aight.</p>

<p>Lunch: I learned from yuki how to say nishuukanmaekaraomricetabetemasen</p>

<p>Lesson 6: Had four 7As, including two talkative good students and
two not so good students (one stuttery and one quiet, who the teachers
(not me) call statuko cause she's like a statue).  I tried to pay
equal attention at different calibres of English to the factions, but
I favored the better students.</p>

<p>Lesson 7: (I don't remember; I didn't write it down)</p>

<p>Lesson 8: Two 7Bs: a real quiet kid named Kento and a chatty mom
(not his) named Tomoko.  I like her.  Gave her a level up 2 (Tony gave
her LU1 yesterday). She obviously studies effectively outside of
class.</p>

<p>Ah geez!  Stupid morning!</p>

<p>In the process of going to bed, I saw that Frank was watching _Red
Dragon_.  <em>Ah.  Red Dragon.</em>  So I watched it with him.</p>

<p><b>Now</b> as I'm going to bed, it's fully light outside!</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Frank says that he should have just killed himself and be done with
it.  "That's a much more interesting ending - choosing to end his
serial killer career for love."</p>

<p>"But I liked Ralph Fienne's tattoo.  That was money."</p>

<p>I'm going to bed now soon as I finish this entry and copy it to my
site.  Will meet Satoko at noon at Cinecitta for lunch.</p>

<p>ps: Frank watched the eyeball chewing scene twice.</p>
