<p>Took a nice nap after teaching Aki at Subway.  She's getting
better, I'm quite certain.  Today she blurted out quite a long
sentence with no errors.</p>

<p>En route to KQ now.  Back to work work work.</p>

<p>Um..  Oh, Shin cancelled our lesson yesterday, but that's cool
cause I had already eaten instead of waiting for him to buy dinner.
Doubly cool is that he called me after his meeting let out and said
he'd take me to the local government office thing (he said Yokohama
City Hall, which it may very well be) to help me find guest housing!
That means I will be more fully engaged in Japanese culture, meeting
some new peeps and chatting up in Japanese far more often than seems
possible with Frank and Matty.</p>

<p>Okay.</p>

<p>After a month or so of depression, whining and sulking in my room
and giving my time to the internet instead of studying, doing what
seemed like nothing except wondering why in the world I am here
instead of with my friends, I feel better.</p>

<p>I've recognized that I let myself get stuck in the rut of Nova -
work work work and feeling stuck stuck stuck with no upward mobility
except becoming more proficient at the dumb Nova way of teaching,
caring nothing (or not much) about my students, blah blah blah.</p>

<p>It's *possible* for me to engage this culture without giving up my
soul to the whims of meeting people in drinking/smoking/gross social
situations (bars ("izakias")).  It's possible to change my housing
situation to one that suits my desires (Japanese chatter instead of
English chatter).  It's possible to find a source(s) of income(s)
that lets me care for my students.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>The revelation came as I glanced through some classifieds online.
They're just like classifieds in the US.  Please come give us your
money; we have the best deal in town, blah blah blah..  it's just all
in Japanese.</p>

<p>To start, as previously encouraged by my personal coach, I just
began to put my desire out there.  "I would like to live with Japanese
roommates instead of American roommates.  Do you know of anyone who's
looking for an American roommate?" etc, to several people that I know
in my Japanese life.</p>

<p>Some people poohpoohed my technique.  "What are the chances of
someone that you know knowing someone who needs a roommate?"  I
dunno.  But asking is better than pouting.</p>

<p>Just last night, Shin called me and said he'd take me on Wednesday
to register for guest housing.</p>

<p>(I'm making up the word register; I have no idea what the process
actually requires.  But we're going to Yokohama City Hall, or some
other government type place to begin the process of securing guest
house living for me.  Awesome.)</p>

<p>I have simply stated my desire: I intend to live in a non-smoking
environment, with sane native Japanese speakers (preferably male to
keep me focused) who are friendly and genuinely interested in helping
me learn Japanese conversation.  Internet access is a plus, and a
nearby train station is a plus.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I have released as trivial the challenges of having recently set up
Yahoo! BB at my apartment, and having a place for janette to stay when
she visits.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>On the language front, I have recently determined that rote
memorization will be required to learn Japanese.  That's a no brainer,
but I had been like, "I already memorized so much!" where 'so much' is
probably 50 or 100 words.  I just gotta memorize more more more
more.</p>

<p>So I'm carrying my flashcards with me again.</p>

<p>Today at work during my last lesson I had a pleasant attractive
single female man to man.  Told her I had a girlfriend so she
shouldn't try anything sneaky.  But she did ask me what I like and I
tried to tell her but couldn't help but laugh a bit because I had this
little sketch by Brak in my head, where the climax goes, "Hello, My
name is Bongo, I like to climb on things, can I have a banana?  Eeek
eeek."</p>

<p>I carefully explained it to her and she thought it was funny.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>The man to man prior to that was with a super shy super quiet super
low 7C 12 year old girl.  I finally got her to name colors on some
animal flash cards I had brought as backup in case the warnings in her
file proved true.</p>

<p>Cracked out a little Japanese to break through to her.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>The four man lesson with all men was pretty good; I had them
querying each other about this woman's photo album in level 7A.
Several variants like, "what could she do when she was 12?" and "when
could she ride a horse?" and then a level 6 structure: "what was she
doing when this picture was taken?"</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Didn't have any of my girlfriends today.</p>

I am trying to read this book, &ldquo;The Field&rdquo; by Lynne McTaggart, but every few paragraphs or so give me the energy (or &ldquo;light&rdquo; as the book would call it) to trip out on an idea. An example is that it was talking about how, in quantum physics, things seem to only exist when they are observed. (Like subatomic particles) It&rsquo;s like the consciousness of the observer brings the observed into being. Ok. This got me wondering if it is the <em>imagination</em> of the observer that creates &ldquo;things&rdquo;&hellip; for example&hellip;. Does &ldquo;The Planet Jupiter&rdquo; have any relationship with the person it was &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; ? <br>
The guy had to expect to find something right?<br>
Maybe the person who discovered cancer was a deep down cynic.<br>
<br>

<p>I like being able to teach.  I just explained to Janette the
difference between storage improvements (CD -> DVD) and language
improvements (WAV -> MP3 -> MP4)</p>

<p>Next: bits</p>

<p>Done. Explained bits and bytes and different encoding systems.  I
loved being able to loop the whole discussion back around to explain
why characters from different systems show up differently.</p>

<p>Shin called and cancelled our meeting tonight.  That's cool with
me; I can study more.  Not that I'm 100% studying.</p>

<p>Good study catalyst: internet is down.</p>

<p>I'm going to call janette.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Oh, a couple hours ago I called Nami, Rie's friend who lived in
Houston for 7 years.  Part of me is like, "wow - *that's* how to learn
a language."</p>

<p>Could I live here that long?</p>

<p>Anyway, we yammered a while and we'll hang out on August 2nd after
my work.  She said she gets to speak very little English in Japan, so
this may be a mutually beneficial arrangement!</p>

<p>Had a good lesson with Aki.  Will go see Pirates of the Carribean
with her on August 6th.  I'll go buy tickets at Cinecitta in
Kawasaki.</p>

<p>I helped her develop this long sentence:</p>

<p>Kawasaki Cinecitta and Yokohama Movru are close to Tsunashima, but
Cinecitta is bigger than Movru, and you can buy tickets at Kawasaki,
so let's go to Kawasaki.</p>

<p>Now.   I'm going to study Japanese.</p>

<p>Good job studying.</p>

<p>I had a revelation of sorts.</p>

<p>just get the vocab in my head and don't worry as much about grammar.</p>

<p>I'm tired enough to fall asleep right now, but I'll probably call
janette for a bedtime story.</p>

<p>Met Fumi and we took the Yamanote line to Shinagawa, got tickets
for the movie, got snacks for the munchies, and now she and I are

<p>Okay okay, wait.</p>

<p>Today started poopy, but then I dragged myself out of bed and did
several of the "little" things that have collected on my list.  Buy
pushpins, mail candy to Elise', buy wide clear tape, call Rie.  I
called Chez too for good measure, and left a message.</p>

<p>Ate lunch with Jen and Olivia, saw pictures of their drunken
revelrie at the fireworks display with some Japanese we know.  I would
have enjoyed hanging with them (( but instead that night I hung out
with Matthew Cecile from OZ, which is at least as awesome cause they
know some fly places in the bush where there is *NO ONE* else.  Rock
on.  We traded hand-drawn maps of our respective countries and I was
all, "don't tell Frank" like 10 times cause I had been all, "um, yeah
a bunch of little states up here like New Jersey and all that, and
yeah Washington DC is in Maryland but I don't know where Maryland is,"
etc. We talked about the genocide our respective cultures has
committed against the native cultures and felt helpless about it.  And
we ate our 1000 yen meal in the safe comfort of the restaurant.)),
maybe next time.</p>

<p>Researched housing in Tokyo area, to see if I can get my shit out
of this apartment and move into a more immersed situation.   Emailed
Rie's friend and emailed Satoko (Nova student) to say HI and see if I
can gain a chatmate if not a flatmate.</p>

<p>(( after hearing from Frank there's a lawsuit against Nova in Osaka
because a teacher and student are like "shove off; you can't keep us
from hanging out," I'm much less scared about meeting with students
outside of school, BUT, there's a concern about letting myself fall
into old behaviors of falling in love and breaking hearts and all
that. I don't want to do that anymore, so I'm being quite forthcoming
that I have a janette at home, and I'm sometimes concerned that she
might feel hurt that I'm hanging out with others (and posting all
about it ..)  Ah well, it makes for good discussions. ))</p>

<p>I got a lovely email from janette, but I didn't call her back; it
was too late o'clock on her side of the globe.</p>

<p>Put posters upon my walls, mostly Matrix Reloaded promotional
stuff.</p>

<p>Played sega fight game with Matty, with both of us trying to use
Nina to beat Xiouin or whatever her name is.  We couldn't beat
her.</p>

<p>Matty left to get shinkansen tickets to see Fuji Rock Fest this
weekend, and then the doorbell rang.</p>

<p>Federal Express.</p>

<p>For me!</p>

<p>From Gary Scout Seven!</p>

<p>Quite dense.. what is it?   I look on the customs ticket:</p>

<pre>
         Commodity Description
           <b>REQUIRED</b>

 Granite Rock
</pre>

<p>This comes, no doubt, from his land in Colorado.  Pink and black
with gray flecks.  Like granite.</p>

<p>Gneiss.</p>

<p>But still no email address from him!</p>

Wow, Fed Ex is fast!

Conversation with Fed Ex lady:

Gary: I need to send this to Japan.
Fed Ex lady: What is its value please?
Gary: Uh, well... it's a rock.
Fed Ex lady: I have to enter a value, sir.
Gary: Uh, one dollar?
Fed Ex lady: Okay. Would you like that insured?

I thought that was pretty funny.

The chunkagranite is actually from Enchanted Rock. I know you have
enjoyed E-Rock in the past, just thought I'd send you a small piece of
it.

<br>hey, i&rsquo;m not hurt about you hanging out with others.<br>
if you fall in love with someone else, well, that&rsquo;s when the whip comes down.(nice expression,eh?)<br>
 what hurts -sometimes- is that you are not Here hanging out with Me.  like-dude- we&rsquo;re wasting time.<br>
  <br>
  but i know,i know. it&rsquo;s not wasted and you gotta do whachu gotta do.<br>
<br>
here&rsquo;s what i think to  quell my doubts:<br>
<br>
                 What is mine will come to me.<br></p>
