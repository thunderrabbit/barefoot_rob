<p>After work yesterday I went straight to bed for 7 hours and woke up
recently and started studying Japanese.  I've learned all the hiragana
(yay!)  That's 71 characters, including the 15 that are similar to
others.  So I'm at the point now of putting characters together to
make longer sounds.</p>

<p>So I figure I'll begin listening to the audio CD that <em>I
think</em> came with the books I'm using.</p>

<p>I had taken the CD to work a long time ago, so I walked to work to
listen.</p>

<p>It's <em>terrible</em> for a beginning student.  A dry voice speaks
dramatically "Vowels and Consonants." then the sounds of the letters
are spoken in Japanese.  Okay, fine; those are not really
translatable, but the order is not the same as that in the book.</p>

<p>It gets worse from there. He says stuff like, "Key Sentences.  Practice."
"Vocabulary." "Vocabulary For Excersizes." after which the Japanese
words are spoken, with no translation, no consistent order, no
repetition, not enough time for a listener to speak the words or
sentences after they are spoken.</p>

<p>I'll wait for <img src="/images/peeps/Rie/li.jpg"><img src="/images/peeps/Rie/e.jpg"> to
help me.</p>

<p>I'm past Kerrrville Texas now, chillin' with the youth and
scorpions and bushes.  I arrived just as they (youth) were arranged in
a circle giving introductions.  I dunno how long most others have been
here.</p>

<p>Edward and I were laughing at the cover of one of the books on the
table, which depicts an arctic wolf walking across the snow.  I'm sure
we'll see those all *over* the place!</p>

<p>I put some of the lemonade powder on a banana and offered it oh so
innocently to Matt, who took a bite, and then was all, 'why is it
citrusey?'  Funny.</p>

<p>We has been trading scenes from Looney Toons cartoons starring
Foghorn Leghorn and The Chicken Hawk.  'I'm a chicken hawk, and you're
a chicken!'</p>

<p>'No no no, boy, I'm not, I say, I'm not a chicken, c'mon over here
and I'll show you a chicken,' as Foghorn leads him over to the dog in
doghouse.  'Now, <em>there's</em> a chicken for you....'</p>

<p>And the little brainy chicken character who folded a paper airplane
that shot down the airplane Foghorn Leghorn made.</p>

<p>And the wolf who appended, 'man' to most of his conversations,
trying to attract the attention of a dog, so he's got a cat shaped
puppet on his hand, and is hiding behind the fence with the puppet
over the fence.  And he says, 'meow.  meow.  meow, man' and sticks his
head up over the fence to say man.  Hilarious!</p>

<p>As I type this, I have a memory that the cat puppet started chasing
a mouse or something that the dog did to counteract the wolf trying to
catch the dog with the cat puppet.  I dunno.</p>

<p>Bedtime now.</p>

<p class=date>7:25 pm Saturday 27-4-02</p>

<p>Today has been fantastic.</p>

<p>Before sleeping last night, I pulled my mattress off the bunk to
the floor in the middle of the main room, beside Meg on her pink
inflatable swimming pool floaty.  I read more <em>Grist For the
Mill</em> by Ram Dass until I fell asleep.  The constant wind all
night made this a wonderful place to sleep.</p>

<p>Grazed for breakfast - cereal, bagels, cream cheese, yogurt, etc.
Then out to the cedar trees after a speech by Bill who basically said
back 150 years ago this was grassland with occasional oak trees.  Now
it's choked with cedar after it was grazed by goats and such.</p>

<p>So we began to clear out some cedar, without harming the oaks.  or
if we did harm an oak, we immediately painted tar on the wound to keep
beetles out.  Some specific beetle carries a disease or something.</p>

<p>Piled a significant amount of cedar in rows to help stop erosion,
then broke for lunch.</p>

<p>Grazed again, this time I had a suicide sandwich - mayo, turkey,
lettuce, cheese, peanut butter, tomato.  Erica and Joey decided it
must be gross, but Joey tried a bite and enjoyed it.  Yep.</p>

<p>Then back outside and we piled rocks in a gully to help slow down
the water.  Also cut some cedar, and I basically massacred a huge
cedar tree, climbing into the tree way up high or way out on branches
and cutting the end of the branches I was on.  Interesting when the
branch on which I was standing would spring up some when the weight of
the end was removed.  Nice dangerous fun for the afternoon.</p>

<p>Super thanks to Kathleen for being my helper during the day, and
for Edward for telling me funny cartoon summaries while I was climbing
all over the tree and we were the last two people out there.</p>

<p>- - - - -</p>

<p>Tossed some frisbees around for a bit and then did a walking tour
of the land for about an hour.  Saw a couple of rabbits and a huge
porcupine.  There is a landing strip in the back of the property,
cause the ex-ex owners had a plane and would fly in from Houston.</p>

<p>I would pay a few dollars to chill out here for the weekend.</p>

<p>===</p>

<p class=date>2:00 pm Sunday </p>

<p>Chillin' with Jack the Sac on YAC, Erica (oh my!), I Love Kate, and
Mattboy at Joe's.  We're in the corner booth where we hoped we would
find the YRUUers from the church.</p>

<p>Didn't find them, but did find Annie/Jessica's mom, looking for
Annie because she was supposed to be helping her mom pack their house
so they can move today.</p>

<p>On the way into San An, I was listening to some preacher on 92.5fm,
who was dissing other preachers who are on TV asking for money, those
that say, 'the money you give to the church will be paid back to you
multiple times.'</p>

<p><em>This</em> preacher said explicitly, 'that's a lie.  Right here
[bible verse] it says that the money you give to the church will be
stored in heaven, and will be paid back in the Second Coming.'</p>

<p>Interesting.</p>

<p>Oh, he also mentioned where he gave church service each Sunday.  He
gave the address and an apartment number.  Yes, he did say 'apartment
number ___' whatever the number was.'</p>

<p>He also said that joking is a sin.  That being joyful was okay, but
actually making jokes or joking around (especially being a stand up
comedian) was a sin.</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>Spent a significant amount of time brainstorming today with Minh -
or a lot of it was me describing to Minh some of my ideas for how
macros should work by calling themselves and saving their own data so
that they can be called interchangably knowing that the next macro
being called doesn't have to save any of the previous macro's data.
Encapsulization is all.</p>

<p>Then showed the same thing to Kevin, sold him on the idea of how
it's better than what we've been doing, or what people besides me have
been doing for a while.</p>

<p>I'm glad that Minh is excited about the next generation of the G3
project.  I really think it can be retooled to be an amazing work of
survey-displaying art.</p>

<p>Now I'm off to Academy to get gloves and a hat and something else -
oh a flashlight before I'm off to Kerrville, Texas.  Kerrrrrrrvilllle
Texas.  Yup.  Kerrrvillle.  It's west of San Antonio.  Lots of hills
and such.  Full moon tonight or tomorrow night.  Should be
beautiful.</p>

Goliath, Your Prints Are Ready

By DAVID POGUE

     At a dinner party at our house last week, a guest was so blown
away by something he saw in my little high-tech workshop that he never
even made it to the hors d'oeuvres.

Of course, there's always quite a bit of gee-whiz technology lying
around the premises. In fact, if you had to describe the décor, you
might describe it as New England Circuit City. But what made such an
impression on our visitors wasn't a gizmo or a gadget - it was a
piece of paper.

Specifically, it was an enormous glossy photo, 13 by 19 inches. What
so impressed our guest was its amazing quality and its vibrant,
popping colors, and the fact that I had printed it myself only five
minutes earlier, using an ordinary inkjet printer.

All right, "ordinary" isn't quite the word. To create photo posters
like this, you need an especially wide inkjet, like the Epson Stylus
Photo 1280 or the new Canon S9000, both priced at $500. (That's the
list price; shopping online can save you about $50.)

Many a popular technology today can be safely described as "not there
yet."  Cellphones aren't there yet. Neither are laptop batteries. Lord
knows PC's aren't there yet.

Photo printers, however, have arrived. Both of these printers spray
six different ink colors (not four, as with most inkjets) to produce
astonishing images. When you feed these machines special photo paper
(about 50 cents a sheet up to 8 1/2-by-11 size), you can't tell the
difference between a printout from the Canon S9000 or Epson 1280 and a
Kodak-developed print, even if you mash your eyeball right up to the
paper.

Now recall the best photo print you've ever seen, and imagine it at 13
by 19 inches, filling your field of vision. Something happens to the
impact of a photo when it's that big. Its emotional overtones are
disproportionately magnified in ways that photo galleries have
capitalized on for years. A candid of a smiling 2-year-old becomes an
unforgettable essay on captured innocence. A stand of trees against a
dark pre-storm sky delivers a palpable chill. It's like the difference
between seeing an Imax movie and watching TV.

One reason most people have never seen their photos at that size is
that they're very expensive: about $25 each from traditional photo
labs. If you own a wide-format inkjet photo printer, on the other
hand, the cost of paper and ink works out to about $2 per
poster. (Online, the 13-by-19-inch photo paper costs about $18 per
10-sheet package.)

Of course, few consumers would leap to spend $500 for a printer that
produces only jumbo prints. After all, the average home has only so
much empty wall space. (On the other hand, one of these printers could
be the cornerstone of a promising business. Heck, just by sitting in
Times Square with a digital camera, cranking out posters of tourists
for $10 a shot, you could retire to Bermuda by the end of the summer.)

Fortunately, these printers are equally capable of printing at more
conventional sizes, all the way down to 4 by 6. In fact, the Canon
S9000 and Epson 1280 are nothing more than stretch-limo versions of
the earlier Canon S900 and Epson Stylus Photo 890 - models you might
consider, in fact, if you relish the thought of superb photographic
quality but don't feel that the added dimensions are worth an extra
$100 or $200.

The Canon and Epson machines are cut from similar cloth. Both connect
to Macs (even those running Mac OS X) and PC's, are very quiet and
take up considerable desk space: two feet across and one foot deep. If
you use the recommended photo paper and mount the pictures under
glass, the images are supposed to remain colorfast for at least 25
years. (I'm still testing this claim, however. Watch this space in
2027.)

Based on research indicating that Americans prefer pictures that
"pop," each company offers an option that heightens color
saturation. The results look more vivid than real life, which is what
makes most American viewers describe the prints as
spectacular. (According to Canon, people in Europe and Asia tend to
prefer more realistic colors.)

Similar though they are in concept, however, the two rival machines
have extremely different specs, which may make a buying decision even
more difficult.

The new Canon printer, for example, is far faster than the year-old
Epson - it's finished with its work and home in the hot tub just as
the Epson is getting its morning coffee. Printing a 13-by-19 poster
takes the Canon about five minutes; the Epson takes nearly three times
as long. The Canon can polish off three or four handsome letter-size
(8 1/2-by-11) enlargements in the same eight minutes it takes the
Epson to finish just one 8-by-10.

The Canon is far more economical, too, because you can replace its
color ink tanks individually ($12 each). On the Epson, you have to
throw away the entire five-tank color cartridge ($30) when any one
chamber runs out - an upsetting moment of waste that you'll have to
endure again and again, since each cartridge expires after only about
25 8-by-10's.

Both machines can produce borderless prints, coating the paper edge to
edge, at sizes up to 8 1/2 by 11 - a great feature that makes the
results seem even more professional. But the Epson manages this feat
by blowing up the picture so that its edges lie beyond the boundaries
of the paper, sometimes chopping off important parts of the photo as a
result.

The Epson isn't without its charms, however. For example, it can print
photos at a wider array of sizes than its rival, including 8 by
10. (The Canon's closest option is 8 1/2 by 11. Surprisingly, the
company doesn't even make 8-by-10 photo paper.) The Epson also
accommodates special 4-inch-wide rolls of photo paper for convenience
in churning out 4-by-6 photos.

The Epson also comes with Adobe's outstanding Photoshop Elements
retouching program, which costs about $90 if purchased separately. The
printer even has a transparent lid, so you can watch the actual
ink-spraying process. It's a lot more fun than it sounds.

The Epson's trump card, however, is its ability to make borderless
prints at the 13-by-19 size. Canon's machine leaves a half-inch white
border all the way around those largest prints, a big disappointment.

If you think you might feel cheated by that last strip of white around
the poster-size shots, the Epson's efforts may be worth waiting
for. Otherwise, the Canon S9000 is the superior printer, especially in
speed and economy.

Either way, you'll need to invest perhaps $15 in a U.S.B. cord, a
crucial cable that neither manufacturer includes. And remember that
these printers guzzle pixels like a 747 guzzles fuel. Don't even think
about them unless you own a scanner or high-resolution digital
camera. Even a 3.3-megapixel camera is barely adequate; stretching its
photos to 13 by 19 can introduce subtle dot patterns in your
printouts. Photos from a four-megapixel camera produce solid,
continuous-tone printouts even at large sizes - just don't crop
them much before printing them. Five- and six-megapixel cameras, of
course, put large-format printers in pig heaven.

Once you're equipped, these printers take the concept of a digital
darkroom to a powerful new level. You'll gain much more control over
which photos you print out and at what sizes, and visitors, standing
slack-jawed before your enlargements, will give you more credit for
camera skills than you may actually have.

Just don't take them in to see your gallery until after the hors
d'oeuvres.

<p><a href="https://www2.alzado.net">Vectorial Elevation</a> is an
interactive artwork designed to transform the Artium Square in
Vitoria-Gasteiz, capital city of the Basque Country, Spain.</p>

<p>Using a three dimensional interface this web site allows you to
design a light sculpture with 18 robotic searchlights located around
the Square. A web page is made for each participant with photos from 4
webcams. The piece will be live from April 22 until May 5, 2002 to
coincide with the opening of the Basque Museum of Contemporary Art
ARTIUM.</p>

<p>Kevin is pretty amazing.  He's my technical-oriented boss, (as
opposed to Karla - I guess she would be my business-oriented boss) and
has been working with SAS for several years (15).</p>

<p>So anyway, I love the way he can use quirks of SAS to solve
problems that I see as impossible.  Here is the latest example:</p>

<pre>
%if %qsubstr(&&&use_var,1,4) = VARS %then %do...
</pre>

<p>Obviously this will cause a WARNING if the length of the value of
the variable name stored in use_var (&&& = 2 levels of indirection in
SAS) is less than 4.</p>

<p>How to solve this?  Determine the length of the thing and not
hardcode 4, right?  Well yes, but(!) in the context where this code
exists, I cannot use any other data steps to determine the length of
the value, and there are no macro functions to do it.</p>

<p>I was stuck.</p>

<p>But Kevin found a brilliant way to solve it, which amounts to
artificially lengthening the value at the point of the comparison (but
not changing its actual value):</p>

<pre>
%if %qsubstr(&&&use_var..xxxx,1,4) = VARS %then %do...
</pre>

<p>The two dots terminate the macro variable name, and the macro
variable name it resolves to.  Then the xxxx is appended to that value
at the moment of the substring comparison.  Perfect.</p>

<p>Just went to lunch with Dude at MB.  He bought mine (cheap 2 for 1
today with coupon!) and I gave him my excess pounds and euros from
European adventure.</p>

<p>On the way back, an old man in a wheelchair slightly waved to me.
I saw he was working on what appeared to be a model airplane.</p>

<p>Turned around and met him.  Name is Paul - he's invented a coffee
machine, a type of grader to fit on a bobcat tractor thing, and has
built fifty-some different model airplanes.  He's invented more I'm
sure, but I didn't stay very long.  He invited me over sometime; I may
do that.</p>

<p>Today was pretty cool; pretty productive.  I have basically gotten
through the list of things to do that I compiled on Monday.  Things to
do for work at least.</p>

<p>Tonight I may go home and take a nap then go out to Dude's house
later and work on website pics some more.</p>
