<p>After Monica's Marta and I arrived at the Bibby's and Janette was
all cleaning the kitchen and such and then was all, "you wanna go for
a walk?"  So we went to see the house where Marta used to be a nanny
for four kids back some years ago.</p>

<p>But first we crept inside a three story house being built a block
down the street from Janette's.  The wood frame and floor and
everything was all built, but no walls were up yet.  Maggie called
while we were inside, and I was all giddy and laughing at the
funniness of the situation and how fun it was to be all climbing
around in the dark and such.</p>

<p>I was wearing no shoes, so I trod carefully in the darkness, but it
seemed relatively safe and flat everywhere.  I climbed out onto the
makeshift scaffolding on the edge of the house that was apparently
being used to let the worker guys do outside-house building stuff up
around the roof.  It was stable, but seemed a bit risky to Marta and
Janette, silly girls.</p>

<p>It turns out though, they had been daring one another to walk on it
while I was in a different part of the house.  That's funny.  I wonder
if I subconsiously heard their dare.  I think I just did it as a
self-dare-challenge thing.</p>

<p>I also climbed up through the unfinished roof and saw something
vertical that looked like a chimney in a way, but had no opening in
the roof to let smoke/etc out.  Weird.  I don't know what it was.</p>

<p>Today, for the first time on my trip (calling SWUUSI the start of
my trip), I have felt anxious or sadness or something amiss in me.
Actually it started last night I think, but I just surfed mindlessly
and ate cookies and ice cream to block it.</p>

<p>Some hint of a bit of sadness; I'm not sure what it is.  I shall
sit meditatefully and see what comes up.</p>

<p class=date>1:33pm</p>

<p>I didn't sit meditatively; Janette came home and I went to work
helping her in the back yard.  Moved some sand from this pile to this
indention, and then pulled nails out of some treated lumber, leaving
it stacked nicely on an old rusty iron frame thing.  Then moved some
bags of mulch to a container and a bicycle out front to be given away
to the world.</p>

<p>Just played disc with Sean and Hart at the park.  While playing I
migrated to the swings and actually caught the disc once while
swinging.  Other times I would jump off the swings and catch (or miss)
the disc.  Fun stuff.</p>

<p>I challenged Sean to a game of Follow The Leader on the jungle gym
type thing and we did some pretty cool convolutions without touching
the lava.  Excellent.</p>

<p>Then Hart drove us to T.C.'s Shaved Ice where I ordered a banana
with blackberry, Hart got blackberry, Sean got grape.  Thanks to Sean
for paying and to Hart for driving.</p>

<p>Janette and I went for a walk around the lake tonight - talked
about God and reality and sin and hell and heaven and death and life
and everything.  Fantastic conversation.</p>

<p>Chilled on my beach chairs in the yard and I actually fell asleep a
bit; the air was so perfectly perfect.  Super nice.</p>

<p>Jack: "May I do some laundry?"</p>

<p>Sean: "Yeah.  You can do some of your own while you're at it."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>We're playing Wahoo again.</p>

<p>Rob: "I wonder if we can go to MJ Designs and get another ball to
match this color [of the set of four balls with one ball off color]?"</p>

<p>Sean: "I'm sure we can.  In fact that's where these balls came from
at MJ Designs."</p>

<p>Rob: "We should go tonight.  Right now."</p>

<p>Sean: "Throw the missing ball to break the window."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Jack:</p>

<p>"Do I wanna be free or do I wanna get outta this place?"</p>

<p>"Six, Harto."</p>

<p>"Ohh.  Lu five."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Hart:</p>

<p>"I've never heard that one.  I've heard Harticus."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Joey:</p>

<p>"Why do I keep killing you? It's great."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Game over.  I lost.  Jack won even though he kept getting knocked
back and then couldn't get a four and when he no longer needed a four
and rolled a four he freaked out and rolled sideways off the ottoman
onto the floor with a thunk yelling, "now I roll a fucking timely
four!"  (Sean and Joey's mom was trying to sleep in the next room,
separated only by a glass door a light curtain.) Joey came in second,
then Hart had a glorious run of sixes and ones to send himself nearly
all the way around the board while I just needed to roll a single 1
and I would have won the game some time ago.  Funny stuff..</p>

<p>After Hart won, I rolled three separate dice in sequence and got a
three, then a two, then a one.</p>

<p>XXX was triple excellent.  Janette and I just went to see it on
Sean's suggestion.  I describe it as a James Bond movie with a punk
guy playing James Bond.</p>

<p>I was really pleased with the car over bridge scene.  Most
excellent.</p>

<p>"I'm untouchable!"  Instantly the windows shatter inward from some
sort of raid.</p>

<p>The sequel should be called "two X to the third" (XXX2 = 2XXX = 2 *
X ^ 3).</p>

<p>The snow boarding scene was pretty fuckin' phat.</p>

<p>I was pleased with how he killed AHAB.  It reminded me of a silent
movie I saw in Ohio some years ago.  Our hero was on the very front of
a run away train and somehow was carrying a railroad tie.  On the
track in front of him was another railroad tie with the delimma being
that he could no way pick up the second tie to get it out of the way.
So he threw the one tie down onto the second tie, knocking it down
using the rail like a fulcrum flipping the second tie out of the way.
Just like using a rocket to sink AHAB.</p>

<p>Oh man I remember the bad scene now.  He was taking pictures with
an infrared camera and sent back to the base <em>color</em> pictures
taking through a rock wall!!  What the fuck is that??  Could it
possibly be possible to discern the wavelength reflecting off a
surface through a rock wall???</p>

<p>Janette likes how he grabbed onto the tower to be saved from the
avalanche.</p>

<p>I think the graphics at the end of the movie were ridiculously
unecessary.  I was pleased with how little computer graphics they used
during the movie.</p>

<p>"You want ice?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, you can chisel it off your heart. ... if you can find
it."</p>

<p>Just FTPd from Hart's computer several .mp3s, including some Eminem
from The Marshall Mathers EP.  The one named "Stan (ft. Dido)" is
funny.  I wonder if that shit actually happened.  That's fucked up if
it did.</p>

<p>Listening to Filter & The Crystal Method now.</p>

<p>Cypress Hill, 2 Live Crew, A Tribe Called Quest, Fatboy Slim,
Eminem, Filter, Jay & Silent Bob, Run-DMC, et. al.</p>

<p>Tonight I got to join Sean and his friend Evan for chatting and
then we visited downtown to find something to do.  Parked at a parking
meter near a club and we didn't have to pay the meter because the time
was after 10pm.  I put a single penny in the meter and the meter kept
the money, but didn't give us any time.  Sean found a dime on the
parking lot and dropped it in.  We got 10 minutes for that.</p>

<p>The club had a long line outside and relatively few people inside.
We walked around the block and then drove to Deep Ellum where several
clubs reside.  Walked around and ended up in a club called DNA, which
charged no cover to get in.  The music was pretty good "Looking From a
Hilltop" by Section 25, but then they got worse and worse with
something by The Cure, then U2, then Sheila E "Glamorous Life" and
something I couldn't identify, then Joan Jett "I love rock and
roll"</p>

<p>Fortunately before that song started, Sean got me off the dance
floor "Evan has to leave," so I put on my Adidas sandals and headed
out with them.</p>

<p>While dancing, I pretty much had the floor to myself.  Only 1 or 2
guys, and at most 5 girls were out there at the very most.  Usually it
was me and about 1 or 3 girls.  I never made eye contact with them; I
was too busy zoning in my own world of dance to let them bother me.
My sparkly toenail polish (from a few weeks ago while here at the
Bibby's and Joey + her mom invited me to paint toenails with them)
glittered under the random sparkly lights.. Nice.</p>

<p>Due to the low bpm in the songs, I kept looking up at the DJs and
lifting my hands like "faster faster faster" and then fingered "2 4 2"
trying to get them to play Front 242.  Nothing doing.</p>

<p>There was a girl there with two glo-sticks tied to strings.  She
whirled them around all speedy gonzales, and often got them tangled
up.  Pretty funny.</p>

<p>Sean came to get me just before Joan Jett came on.  I was glad to
leave before such a dumb song.</p>

<p>We walked to the car and headed home.  I washed my feet cause the
soles were black.</p>

<p>Saw <em>Minority Report</em> today with Marta.  Pretty good movie,
without too much overdoing the special effects.  But how are we going
to have cars drive on walls in 52 years?  And why are cars driving on
the left side of the futuristic roads (I think that's what I saw)?
And how are his real eyeballs going to stay preserved so well in a
plastic bag?</p>

<p>The scene with the people fighting and then stopping to let the
spiders scan their retinas and then immediately go back to
fighting was pretty funny.</p>

<p>I think the story was pretty well held together, but I don't get
why the cops didn't arrest John Anderton right after Leo Crow shot
himself and made it look like John had done it.</p>

<p>I also didn't get how they tracked down Anderton when he went to
get his eyes replaced.  That sandwich looked pretty gross.  Good job,
prop department.</p>

<p>That's all I can think of now.</p>

<p>This morning I woke up at 6am, purchased sharp cheddar from
Brookshire's and made cheese omlettes for myself and Marta.  "eggs and
cheese and eggs and cheese eggs and cheese and eggs and cheese..."
Worked some more on my photo albums; I can see a bit of a dent in the
pile of pics. (no pun intended (dent in))</p>

<p>Dammit.  I forgot to bring cash today; I'll have to pay Marta back
when we get to her apartment.  We're going to the Science museum in
Plano (?) Dallas (?) somewhere with Leigh's two boys (10 and 7 years
old).  Afterward Marta and I will have ice cream with Erin, a youth
from Denton.</p>

<p class=date>12:24pm</p>

<p>When I asked what museum we're going to, Marta said, "The Science
Place," and I thought she was being imprecise.  But it really is
called The Science Place.  We lost Spencer for a while, but found him
later.  We're munching now after watching ball tracks, big soap
bubbles, rope spider webs, driving simulations where you can choose to
be inebriated with alcohol (beer, lite beer, 7 & 7, gin and tonic,
wine, soda pop) and/or drugs (pot, cocaine, crack), an echo tube,
night vision goggles, a car crash simulator, wheel chair with a ramp
and a door and a door hump to let people get an example of being wheel
chair bound, bernoulli floating balls, a periscope that looks up over
the roof of the museum, dinosaurs, birthing babies, other science
stuff, and a guy wearing a red t-shirt marked "I EAT GLUE" in small
capital letters.</p>

<p class=date>2:54pm</p>

<p>IMAX movie was nice - featured Venuzuela, and pleaded the case for
keeping nature natural.</p>

<p>I spent a lot of time watching a cylinder of water be spun like a
vortex with a couple of ping pong balls floating in the water, and
three marbles rolling around the bottom.</p>

<p>Now I'm chillin' on the floor near a roller coaster (descending
sine wave) for golf balls with 1 drop ramp and four peaks and troughs.
The track is so jacked up that balls rarely make it past the first
peak.  Once out of about fifty or a hundred times has it made it, and
that time, interestingly, it made it past the second peak as well.
Spencer and Conner and others are hoarding balls and dropping them
down the ramp.  Quantity is proportional to fun in this game.</p>

<p>Wow; I'm using dvorak layout and I'm impressed with relatively how
much I remember.</p>

<p class=date>3:14pm</p>

<p>Bronwyn called!  I told her that I chose not to pay $700 to come
see her in Helena. I'd rather plan a bit farther ahead and save a few
dollars.</p>

<p class=date>9:18pm</p>

<p>Just went to the town square in Denton with Erin and Marta.  Ate
ice cream and had a lovely time.  Went for a walk afterward, stopped
by the Recycled Books store until they closed with announcemtns at
8:45, 8:50, and finally at 8:55, "attention. <em>valued</em> recycled,
books, customers," I interrupted with "for goodness sake's get out!"
"we will be closing in five minutes, and we will open again at nine
A.M. as we do seven days a week."</p>

<p>We took the hint and left; I think we had been the last customers
in the store.</p>

<p>Dropped off Erin at her house with big hugs and blessings.  She
said, "I don't want to go back.." so much weight behind those words.
I wish her the best.</p>

                        <p class=date>7:39pm CDT Tuesday 13 August 2002</p>

<p>Today was spent almost entirely inside, working on my photo albums
and watching The Simpsons (watched last 10 episodes of Season 2),
listening to Nine Inch Nails, and munching cereal.  What a perfectly
lazy-ass vacation this has been!</p>

<p class=date>9:37pm</p>

<p>Ah, but now I have gone skating around the lake near Marta's
apartment.  It's about a mile around, with a middle school on one end
and a playground on the other.  I skated twice around the lake, once
around the playground, and once around the school.</p>

<p>I didn't have my helmet on (first time I have significantly skated
without my helmet since my accident in September 1994) because I left
it with my bike at the Bibby's house in Dallas, so I didn't do a lot
of dangerous jumping type stuff, but skated pretty fast through the
dark, trusting that I would see any walkers on the sidewalk (there
were several) even though none of us bore lights of any variety and
the slim moon behind clouded sky doesn't help illuminate the terrain
effectively.</p>

<p>I did jump down about 4 steps at a time at the school, and had no
problem with that.  On the way down the hill from the school to the
loop around the lake, I had to make a sharp turn on the sidewalk so I
jumped a bit of grass, indicated by the arrow below</p>

<pre>
\  s   \            /      /  
 \  i   \  grass   /      /   
  \  d   \        /      /

      \  l   \/      /        
       \  k         /  
        \          /   
         \        /    
          |      /     
         /      /      
        /      /       
       /      /

    /      /  
   /      /   
  /      /    
 /      /     
</pre>

<p>I barely hit the grass where the arrow is located on my jump, so
the landing was a bit tilted forward, but I recovered nicely.</p>
