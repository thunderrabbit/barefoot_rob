<p><p>Yay!</p>

<p><p>Today was payday at my work.  $823 for me for two weeks&rsquo; work. Today I scoured the internet for a bulk email management program, but found only 2 possibilities for us.</p>

<p><p>We need one that will allow us to send a unique attachment to 30000 email addresses, keep track of bounces, easily resend to a few addresses, and that&rsquo;s about it.</p>

<p><p>I found tons and tons of software to help spammers scour the Internet for email addresses, and how to send email &ldquo;without your ISP knowing you&rsquo;re sending bulk email!&rdquo; and &ldquo;free 50,000 fresh email addresses with your order!&rdquo; and stuff like that. No wonder spam is so prolific!</p>

<p><p>Did a little bit of javascript stuff, making some windows refresh as a different window is clicked.  I did that for Dude for some project he&rsquo;s doing at his work.</p>

<p><p>My friend Jennie sent me a super <b>sick</b>ening photo of a crocodile with his gut cut open and&hellip; nevermind. It&rsquo;s gross. Don&rsquo;t click here<a href="https://www.artbell.com/images/amercroc.jpg">!</a></p>

<p><p>After work I filled out a form for my insurance company so they will pay for my stitches from back in JUNE! Ack.  I am anti-impressed with them.</p>

<p><p>Yay!  Going to skate now!  It&rsquo;s 7:45pm</p>

<p><p>nice.  My Card A balance is 0 dollars.  Soon as I finish this entry, I&rsquo;ll have them pay Card D (or was it C?)</p>

<p><p>Until yesterday I have had just one computer (PII 350Mhz) running with 2 hard disks in it - a 1 gig and 8 gig, with 300 megs given to Windows 95 and the rest to linux.  I&rsquo;ve been using linux to access the internet and everything.</p>

<p><p>I had 2 disks sitting on my desk and a shell of my old linux machine (PII 233Mhz) with no hard disks in it.  I began the process of installing those disks in the machine.  One of the disks was reporting bad media or faulty track 0, and could not be used.  Doh!  That was a 2.5 gig.  The other (1 gig) formatted okay, and I got Win 95 installed on it, but it seems to have some surface errors that I&rsquo;m having scandisk fix now.  It&rsquo;s taken all night because it keeps restarting (even though I&rsquo;m running in safe mode with no other drivers up; MS is such crap).</p>

<p><p>Yesterday at KTRU, I was thrilled to see 2 or 3 more of the CDs I reviewed recently are in playlist!  Yay!  Mostly thrilled to see Momus <em>Stars Forever</em>; I really enjoyed that one.  I waited until I got some callers (so I knew people were listening. (I had announced as soon as I got on the air, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re listening, call me and I&rsquo;ll give you free bumper stickers!&rdquo; and no one called.  (Maybe free bumper stickers are not enough to get a call.))) and then played one of my favorite tracks.  I don&rsquo;t remember the name of it, but it&rsquo;s a hard rap in first person about how shy the rapper is.  Very funny.</p>

<p><p>Also at KTRU, I got to give away passes to <a href="https://www.theminusman.com">The Minus Man</a>.  I had helped myself to a pass (we had a stack; I assume it was okay.) and Kristen and I went last night.  The movie was Okay, but not thrilling or even quite captivating, but more odd. It was basically about some guy who was a bit mentally unstable and seemed very nice, but gently killed people.  At least Janeane Garafulo (sp) was cute.</p>

<p><p>Right now I&rsquo;m going to update my credit card stuff on my front page and go to work.  See ya!</p>

<p><p>Tonight Ultimate was great fun.  I played three games (lost two) and made some good catch attempts.</p>

<p><p>One was a wacked out tall throw that put me near the fence and a bench (with Kristen on it) and I went sky for the disc, and had both hands on it, but they weren&rsquo;t together so it flipped out of my grasp.  doh!  I landed and scraped my arm on concrete (where the old benches were), but didn&rsquo;t stop at all.</p>

<p><p>A different time I had an equally wacked out catch and I caught it, super tall in the air one hand catch!  And I even had a great throw after that!  (There exists an unverified theory that the quality of the catch times the quality of the throw is a constant.)</p>

<p><p>Another time in an attempt to zip the disc down the fence to Becca, I totally threw it perfectly along the fence, but way over her head. &ldquo;Wonder!  She&rsquo;s not the bionic woman!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Stinky sweaty came home, tons of dirt down my shower drain, wrote this entry now going to bed.</p>

<p><p>Tomorrow is beach with Kristen and Farrah!</p>

<p><p>Oh, I named this file ultimate_population because at one point there were 28 people on the field &ndash; 14 against 14.  Crazy!</p>

<p><p>Hmmm.</p>

<p><p>Card A said it might take 2 weeks to make the balance transfers, but I called them tonight anyway to see what was up.  Turns out that neither one was processed; it would have put me over my credit limit.  Doh.  I think a finance charge was applied to Card A and the balance transfers would have therefore put me over my limit.  They were carefully measured to put me right exactly at my limit.</p>

<p><p>So I asked the guy if I could make a balance transfer.  He reminded me that the current balance that I carry would stay at the higher interest rate of 13.15% until I pay off the balance transfer.</p>

<p><p>Fair enough.  So I believe I will transfer Card A balance to Card C and then back to Card A.  He said that would be no problem.</p>

<p><p>Called Card C and they said they didn&rsquo;t do balance transfers.  Hmf.   So I&rsquo;m going to now call Card D.</p>

<p><p>Called Card D and the woman said no problem and they will pay $640.09 to Card A within 3 to 5 days.  &ldquo;To be safe,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we have to say that. It will probably be more like 1 or 2 days.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>So as soon as that goes through, I&rsquo;ll have Card A pay Card D for the entire Card D balance, effectively moving the balance from 12.99% to 4.9% interest.</p>

<p><p>Nice!</p>

<p><p><hr align="left" width="25%"></p>

<p><p>In other news, I&rsquo;m going to play Ultimate tonight and Kristen is coming to watch.</p>

<p><p>Then tomorrow Kristen, Farrah and I are going to Galveston.  Yay!</p>

<p>Yesterday after doing laundry my nose got all totally stopped up and I
was blucky all day at work.  Even this morning at 4am I had like major
sinus headache and couldn&rsquo;t breathe so I took two pseudophedrine
hydrochloride tablets.  Oh so much better.  Today I could breath but
my headache was still there off and on throughout the day.  This
evening at 8pm I took two aspirin.  (I don&rsquo;t know how to spell the
chemical name.)  Oh so much better now at 9:30pm.</p>

<p>Today at work I essentially created a firewall for a small portion of
our website.  One set of files must only be accessed by a certain IP
address, so I told our server to only serve that portion to the
particular IP address.  My boss thought I was pretty smart.  :-)</p>

<p>Tomorrow I will upgrade one Windows 95 machine to Windows 98 to see if
that corrects an intermittant printing problem.  Hopefull that will
fix it and I can look even smarter.</p>

<p>Kristen and I are going to watch a movie or something at her parents,
either Pulp Fiction or something else they might possibly maybe have
that I&rsquo;d prefer to watch.</p>

<p>OH!!! I found on the internet the complete text to Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide
To The Galaxy trilogy!  I have the URL bookmarked at work..  hang on..</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t find it now.  I found one that included Book I, but not all 5
books in the trilogy.</p>

<p>Okay, now we&rsquo;re going to watch a movie.</p>

<p>I went skating last night but didn&rsquo;t really have the energy to do
much.  I fell once while jumping over a road hump thing.  The fall was
not bad, but was an indication that something was amiss in my skating
abilities.  I had never previously fallen while jumping a road hump!
(There are times when I don&rsquo;t make it all the way over the hump, but
that doesn&rsquo;t cause a fall.</p>

<p>On the way to downtown I kinda tripped once, jumping sideways off the
sidewalk into the street.</p>

<p>Once we got to Louisiana Street, I zipped down with traffic down past
Jones Plaza where Party On the Plaza was being held.  No problem doing
it this time, but I didn&rsquo;t have huge big crazy energy that I usually
do.</p>

<p>I rested at the plaza and then did the street thing once more.</p>

<p>This time I almost fell and it would have been really bad.  My right
skate hit a small pothole in the street (small like 3 inches across)
and I almost fell on my face.  I recovered quickly though and hopped
up onto the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Apparently it was time to go home.</p>

<p>On the way out, I saw Ryan!  He&rsquo;s one of my youth at Emerson, except
for the fact that I&rsquo;m not currently a youth advisor there.  Met his
parents and sister.</p>

<p>Near City Hall, I saw some guys painting in the street. They were
measuring and marking 10 foot square blocks for some kind of booths
for a street fest type deal.  That was pretty neat.  A couple times he
lost track of what number he was s&rsquo;posed to paint in the block, so I
reminded him, but he didn&rsquo;t thank me.</p>

<p>Got home, and I boiled some water for chicken soup tonight and forgot
about it and it all boiled away.  No harm done, fortunately.  It was
just water and I didn&rsquo;t cook the dry pot for too long.  Whew!</p>

<p>Sleep sleep sleep.</p>

<p><p>Today it was decidedly cold when I woke up!  I&rsquo;ve been sleepin&rsquo; with only a sheet for the past some weeks, and my bedroom window is open so Spot can get in and out via his tree.  But this morning I woke up and brrrr!  It was like 60 degrees!  I couldn&rsquo;t find my comforter in my sleepy state, so I grabbed my sleeping bag and recuddled myself up for a bit.</p>

<p><p>It was about 6:30 am.</p>

<p><p>Oh wait.  Today I was going to do laundry.  So I got up, took a soothing hot shower and collected my ton of dirty clothes, and headed off to the laundry mat.</p>

<p><p>I listened to the Ben and Sarah show on KTRU while waiting for my laundry to complete. They&rsquo;re fun.</p>

<p><p>Finished laundry (that was quick!) and went straight to work.</p>

<p><p>Here at work I&rsquo;ve been reading about DSL and getting some good basic knowledge about how to decide what options to choose and good stuff like that.  But, I even got to show off my smart html / web brain on a question my boss had.</p>

<p><p>He wanted to block all but only certain IP addresses to a set of files.  I figured out how to do it blocking a single IP address, but when it came to blocking a set of addresses, I wasn&rsquo;t sure how Network ID and Subnet Masking came into play.  Hmm.  So I called super smart Marcel and he was able to get me straightened out enough to get it.</p>

<p><p>I got it.</p>

<p><p>Good thing too because tomorrow at 8am we&rsquo;re going to implement the changes!</p>

<p>This morning before KTRU, I purchased a cassette tape to record
my show for Zara, who requested a Rob Mix tape.  When she asked
me for such a tape, I was all, &ldquo;when will I ever have time to
make a mix tape???&rdquo;  Oh yeah..  I can just record my show at
KTRU!  So that is what I did.</p>

<p>However, at KTRU I was not able to get the station turned on.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s off when I get there in the mornings this semester, but a
quick phone call with the secret code will turn it on. Not this
time.  So I paged the station General Manager, and called the
Station Manager.  Station Manager suggested something to try.
General Manager called me back and suggested a solution, but
after I tried the first suggestion, the station came on.   Yay!</p>

<p>Good thing I was recording the whole event, and entertainingly, I
recorded my end of the last two phone conversations at the
beginning of the tape!  Great!!!</p>

<p>We had a whole stack of passes for two to Happy Texas, a movie
about some escaped convicts posing as beauty pageant experts.</p>

<p>I announced them on the air and I gave away two and grabbed a
pass for myself.  Amanda and I went to see it and thought the
movie was pretty funny!   I even cried at the very end, although
I believe the scene was not designed to be tear jerking. Oh well.</p>

<hr />

<p>Also today, I reviewed a 2 CD set by Momus, called Stars Forever,
which I really enjoyed!!  I turned in milk bottles at the grocery
store to get the deposits back (dollar each for seven bottles)
and then purchased printer ink cartridge for my printer so I
could print the CD review.</p>

<p>Turned in the CD and said HI to the DJs there and asked Holly if
she knew of a PJ Harvey song that had chorus, &ldquo;is that all there
is?&rdquo;  because the owner of Mission Burritos asked and I think
she&rsquo;ll give me free burrito coupons to give away at the station
if we can find the song for her.</p>

<p>Outside the station were 200 or so CDs being tossed, so I went
through the entire stack and pulled out about 4 for myself and
about 12 for presents for friends.  Nice!  Come by the station if
you want some CDs!</p>

<p>Then to Record Rack, where I said HI to Bruce and tried to sell
him 7 unopened CDs from the KTRU stack, but he said he couldn&rsquo;t
sell them.  Oh well, but oh yes he had NIN new album the fragile
(halo 14) which I bought after some internal debate.  Finally I
decided it was NIN; I had to have it.</p>

<p>Then home and listened to the album, while waiting for Amanda to
arrive so we could go see Happy Texas and we saw it and she went
home and here I am.</p>

<p>On Saturday night I played Ultimate with the guys at UH.<br />
This is the third week in a row I&rsquo;ve been back playing with them
and I&rsquo;m loving it!  I used to play all the time back in 1993 and
1994 and into 1995 and maybe even a tad beyond that.  I&rsquo;d like to
be a more regular player for some time to come.</p>

<p>For more info on this group, see <a href="https://www.stephenmcleod.com/ultimate.html">McLeod&rsquo;s Ultimate Frisbee Page</a>,
or <a href="https://members.aol.com/gremillion/diskone.htm">Rod Meek&rsquo;s SNS Ultimate</a>.</p>

<p>So anyway, on Saturday I had a super great throw and a super
great catch!</p>

<p>I also found that my endurance is getting better after just 3
weeks.  Nice.</p>

<p>The throw I made was for 1 point to Mike, who was speeding across
the endzone.  I targeted him perfectly and he made the catch
almost in self defense; that disc would have hurt!!</p>

<p>But the best part about the throw is I threaded it between two
defensive players as they closed in on the trajectory, and even
just past Chadwick, who was on my team, but not past the goal
line (I believe).  Anyway, super perfect throw and everything.</p>

<p>But the catch I made was even more classic!  Someone, I think
Sean, threw a long shot down the field to me.  Kathleen &ldquo;Cat&rdquo;
Catchings ran toward me to attempt to block the throw. I was
turned backwards running and she was facing me, closing in
quickly, but could not see the disc, which was closing in on
<em>her</em> even more quickly.</p>

<p>All at once, Cat kinda crashed into me, and I literally caught
the disc behind <em>her</em> back as it crashed into her.  So
funny, and would have been a great shot on tape!!</p>

<p>Great fun and I look forward to being back this Saturday!</p>

<p>(except for the possibility that Jason and I (Australia trip
Jason) might go on a short road trip to Enchanted Rock!)  That
will be cool if we go.  He is supposed to call me today and let
me know if he has the weekend off from work.  I told the guys at
Ultimate, &ldquo;if I&rsquo;m not here next week, it means I&rsquo;m on top of
Enchanted Rock.&ldquo;)</p>

<p><p>Today at work we had problems with our web server.  The CPU was being maxed out, but low disk activity, and low web data activity.  I watched as my boss did troubleshooting; I was just getting a feel for how everything goes together.  Finally he was able to track it down that a database access was taking way too long to occur.</p>

<p><p>Turns out that while fetching a password for the web user, the database was being locked and just all kinds of crap.  I&rsquo;m not going to explain it because I&rsquo;m not impressed with how it was st up.  The problem has been temporarily fixed, and I will talk with my boss soon to see how it can be made better.</p>

<p><p>But!! I had fun on my website today!  <!-- Go check out the <a href="../../index.html">front page</a>. --> I added an applet (3 times)!!  I&rsquo;m not sure who wrote the applet, but I have a feeling it comes with JDK, so I don&rsquo;t feel bad using it.  I&rsquo;m thankful for <a href="https://www.unfpa.org">unfpa</a> using it so I could swipe it from them.</p>
