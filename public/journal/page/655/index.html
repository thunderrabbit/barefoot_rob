<p><p><h1>Oh my goodness</h1></p>

<p><p>That was so cool!!!!</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m not saying <em>I</em> did anything particularly cool, but I totally loved being a DJ, especially at KTRU, cause we play all kinds of random crazy good stuff, but nothing that you&rsquo;ll hear on commercial radio.</p>

<p><p>Michael was the DJ in charge of the shift, and he spoke first on the air, but I did the next 3 or 4 spoken portions (I&rsquo;m so new I don&rsquo;t even know what it&rsquo;s called!)</p>

<p><p>I read 2 PSAs (Public Service Announcements) and did the legal ID at the 11 o&rsquo;clock hour.  &ldquo;K-T-R-U, Houston&rdquo; and then read the PSA, then announced the KTRU Roller Prom which will be this Saturday and hella fun, and then reviewed the songs we had just played, and then cued the first song for the next DJ.</p>

<p><p>Okay, you may think I&rsquo;m weird after reading the following (you may already think I&rsquo;m weird, and for that I thank you), but the coolest <em>coolest</em> <b><em>!!coolest!!</em></b> thing I did was cue up a vinyl on the turntable. Just the simple act of zipping the record around by hand to find the exact spot where the song started, and to <em>hear</em> it all normal volume and stuff, and just playing with it back and forth over that part..  My heart lept with joy. I loved it. I know I must play on some turntables sometime. Got to got to got to. Gotta do what I love and I loved that.</p>

<p><p>Called Manda and got her cell phone, called Wende and she never came to the phone, called Wende a couple hours later and turns out she had heard me at the 11 o&rsquo;clock hour, and didn&rsquo;t even recognize me!  &ldquo;That was you??&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>She is my first confirmed listener that I know (I know we had others because people called in) but I like know her and stuff.
Nevermind.</p>

<p><p>I loved it and look forward to going back.  I&rsquo;ll be doing my second training this Monday, 3-5pm CST.  Even if you are not local, you can hear us on realaudio <a href="https://www.ktru.org">www.ktru.org</a> and listen on the web!  We are not a talk station, but we&rsquo;ll play some cool random tunes for you.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m actually going to go back to the station now to say HI to Meg, who I essentially know; she is the sister of Ellen, one of my youth in Dallas.</p>

<p><p>Yay!!!</p>

<p><p><b>STATE OF MY LIFE</b></p>

<p><p><ol></p>

<p><p><li>Manda has been found. She was never lost, but got swamped with school and Miss Texas preparations and life in general. When I got to talk with her, I said I was super glad she&rsquo;s busy, and asked that she simply let me know she&rsquo;s okay if she misses a meeting or date or something.</p>

<p><p><li>Yesterday I got a call from KTRU. <b>I got a job as a DJ there!!</b> I am so so so super pumped excited and wow!! We have a training / meeting thing at 2pm this Sunday and I am psyched!!
I&rsquo;ll get to say stuff like, &ldquo;You are listening to ninety-one point seven F M, K-Truue!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p><li>Dude and I finished recreating MR Labs website!  We were up until 5am this morning, with a goal to get it complete before he left at 2:30pm for 8 days in Nicaragua.  Check it out at <a href="https://www.mrlaboratories.com">www.mrlaboratories.com</a> Wheeee!!!!</p>

<p><p><li>Today at around 1:30pm after I woke up at noon, I heard a lot of clippin&rsquo; and cloppin&rsquo; outside my front windows..  It was a trail ride walking down the street - bunch of people on horses and a couple wagons and a police car at each end.  Wow!  So I put on my skates and caught up with them about a mile down the street.</p>

<p><p>I waved and talked to a couple of the riders and one guy, Larry, was all, &ldquo;grab onto my horses tail and I&rsquo;ll pull you!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;um, um..&rdquo; and didn&rsquo;t do it.</p>

<p><p>Then another woman offered the same thing and I was all, &ldquo;but what if he kicks?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t kick!&rdquo; piped up a woman behind her as she tugged on the horse&rsquo;s tail. &ldquo;See?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Cool.  So I grabbed firmly but gently onto her horse&rsquo;s tail and ziinngg!! She took off at a trot up along the rest of the riders!  Wow!  I got pulled on skates by a horse!  I did it 2 more times, once with the first girl and once with Larry, and I gave someone my camera to take a picture, so I will hopefully have one on the site soon!</p>

<p><p><li>Dude and I worked dutifully on MR Labs website, but today he has left for Nicaragua for 8 days or so.  I&rsquo;ve been spending so much time with him that I hardly will know what to do!</p>

<p><p>But we&rsquo;ve got some clients lined up, so I&rsquo;ll be creating some websites, including one for writers and one for an artist to advertise her work.

<p><p>On Sunday night, Manda picked me up from the airport. I told her about the whole weekend and totally fell asleep with the understanding that I would see her on Monday at Project Heart.</p>

<p><p>I didn&rsquo;t talk to her all day Monday, which was okay; she&rsquo;s got school and I had 71 email messages and website stuff with Dude, but she didn&rsquo;t show up to Project Heart.</p>

<p><p>Hmmm.  I called her afterward and left messages on her cell phone and home phone.</p>

<p><p>That night I talked to Brandie and converted pennies into susan b anthony dollars.</p>

<p><p>Now Tuesday is well underway and I still haven&rsquo;t heard from her.</p>

<p><p>My angels say she&rsquo;s okay, but I&rsquo;m just writing to express my concern and sadness and to say, &ldquo;hey, I miss you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Today Dude and I worked more on MR Labs, and plan to unveil the new site at <a href="https://www.mrlaboratories.com">www.mrlaboratories.com</a> by Friday.</p>

<p><p>Gymnastics was fun this evening; I did some roundoff and super tall back flips with good height and all that good stuff. Yay!</p>

<p><p>I bounced on the trampoline and kinda scraped my neck vertebrae doing 15 front flips in a row, landing on my back each time.</p>

<p class=note>(transcribed from my diary)</p>

<p>Today I felt pretty unproductive.  I wrote the following in my diary during Project Heart:

<blockquote>
<p>I'm having a crappy day because I didn't go outside even one single time and just sat in front of the
computer and <b>did some email</b> and <b>scanned Houston Rally pictures</b> but didn't really get important
stuff done. I <b>did my budget a bit</b> and <b>updated MR Labs</b> website a bit but it doesn't work. I <b>got $72 from
Flashnet</b> in the mail, but I didn't deposit it. I <b>cleaned out my bag</b> from the weekend, but didn't find
my Project Heart book. I only did piddly stuff.

<p>I'm only focusing on the negative and can't see the good in what I've done.

<p><pre>Every step forward is a step forward</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The first portion above is what I wrote at first and the second to last line is my analysis, and the last line is my
positive statement to help me reverse my negative thinking.

<p>The items <b>in bold</b> are the positives that I highlighted in my diary to encourage myself to focus on them.

<p>During the class I was offered the excellent idea that maybe I felt unproductive even while I put together <b>Recycling Day</b>,
an accomplishment in my life that exemplifies great work that feels productive now that I look back on it. I'm going to go
back through my diaries to that point in my life and see if I felt unproductive then. If I felt unproductive then, but look back on 
it now and believe I was productive, that will encourage me to change my thinking about the now.

<p><hr width="40%">

<p class=date>3:24am Tuesday 9 February 1999</p>

<p><p>After class, I got a message from Brandie, who I met in Atlanta at the Flashnet meeting.  She is currently in town and
invited me to come say HI to her at her hotel.  I called Manda to invite her, or to see if we could do something else, but got
her voice mail, so I went to see Brandie.</p>

<p><p>I showed her a bunch of rally pictures and she talked a lot about her travels to Africa and Oregon and Germany,
and I was totally enthralled.  &ldquo;Brandie, I am so inspired by you and your adventures!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>She was all, &ldquo;you just gotta go do it!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>So very true. I just gotta go do it and believe (trust and believe) the youth will be okay without me for a week or a month or
however long it is, and believe I can make the money to afford to go and just <b>GO!</b></p>

<p><p>Being inspired, though it was midnight, I was all, &ldquo;wanna go see some cool stuff in Houston?&rdquo; and <em>zip</em> we were out
the door and on the road.</p>

<p><p>I drove us to Hermann Park and we checked out the big granite ball at the Museum of Natural Science. It weighs five thousand
pounds and is &ldquo;floating&rdquo; on a layer of water so people can spin it with relative ease. Amazing and I totally love it!  We got it
spinning super fast - fast enough to make the water splash out of the bottom, which is always a fun challenge I like to accept when
I go play with this globe late at night.</p>

<p><p>On a side note, driving on the grass between the trees through the park looking for vagrants or something was a cop car across
the street from us. He drove around shining his lights and stuff and then drove away.</p>

<p><p>We walked over to another fountain, the one near the large sundial.  Brandie kicked off her shoes (one entertainingly
fell into the water which she quickly retrieved, &ldquo;thank goodness for Pay Less!&rdquo;) and we both stepped into the water. We splashed
around a tiny bit and soon the cop car drove by, then slowed, then turned around and stopped near us.</p>

<p><p>I walked over and was all, &ldquo;HI&rdquo; and he was super nice and explained that the park was closed.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been looking for you for 15 minutes!&rdquo;
he then exclaimed.  &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you see me driving around in the grass?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, but I figured you were looking for vagrants or something!  I was just showing my friend the park; she&rsquo;s from Atlanta.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>He explained the park closes at 11pm except if the planetarium has a laser light show after that time, or if there is a show at
Miller Outdoor Theater.</p>

<p><p>Fair enough, so we left.  He waited until we got to the car and began to drive away before he left.  I thought it would be funny
in a not so funny way to turn back around after he drove off.  Not funny enough to actually do it, but yeah.</p>

<p><p>To my house we went and Brandie looked through about 20 rolls of film that I&rsquo;ve taken in the last couple years, mostly from rallies
and Costa Rica trip. (Yes I still intend to finish writing about that trip!)  At like 2:30am, I drove her back to the hotel and dropped
her off.</p>

<p><p><img src="/journal/images/1999/susan_b_receipt.jpg" align="left">
Back to my house I went and stopped by the Post Office to see just how many pennies I could convert to Susan B Anthony dollars.
Went in and there was a sticker sign thing over the coin accepting slot, &ldquo;sorry for the inconvenience, we are working on the problem.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Hmmm.</p>

<p><p>I pulled the sticker off enough to put a penny in.  It worked.  I dropped in a nickel.  It worked.  I dropped in two hundred twenty one
more pennies, and they all went in fine.  I inserted a five dollar bill for a grand total of $7.27.  Hmmm, need six more cents.  I went to the car
(leaving the $7+ credit on the machine) and found a dime. That&rsquo;ll work.</p>

<p><p>Put in the dime, punched the buttons to order a single 33 cent stamp, four pennies, seven beautiful Susan B Anthony dollars plus
one receipt.  I put the sticker back just like it had been. <br>Sweet.</p>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s now 3:50am Tuesday 9 February 1999.</p>

<p><p>Good night.</p>

<p><p>My Aunt Mercedes died a few days ago. She had pretty bad and icky cancer all over, so I&rsquo;m glad that she&rsquo;s no longer suffering from that.</p>

<p><p>She remains a super great loving wonderful memory in my mind. I appreciate all the care she gave to her kids and us.</p>

<p><p>Today Fred is driving down from Denton to Houston and he and I will drive over to Slidell, Louisiana, a trip we&rsquo;ve taken several times with lots of fun memories.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ve got to go pack and stuff.</p>

<p>Pete just farted, and describes the flavor as awesome. The ride up with Fred was fun - oh we're in Slidell, Louisiana for our aunt Jean's funeral. We're puttin' the fun back in funeral. We're talking roller coaster stories now.

<p>It's good to catch up with Pete every once in a while.

very much and would never wish her harm or ill will of any sort.
I believe she is wonderfully happy being free from cancer and 
free from the world; I'm joyful for her new experiences.]</pre>

<p>I drove most of the way from Houston and we stopped in Beaumont to get sweatshirt and sweatpants for me since it was cold in Fred's convertible. Ate at Wendy's and kept driving. I drove like 4 or 5 hours and then slept a lot as Fred drove. He had 1 wrong turn, but got us to the house no sweat.

<p>I'm contemplating death and the death process. Is Jean watching? Is she bored? How long will she hang around near her body?  Hmmmm.

<p>Pete and Fred are upstairs getting a drink or something. I'm not sure why Fred and I think Pete is so funny, but he is.

<p><pre>[<a href="/journal/images/rob/rob_undies.jpg">Here's a pic</a> from the morning of the funeral as Fred and I were getting ready.]</pre>

<p>In the car driving now.

<p>I read from a book last night <em>How Good Do We Have To Be?</em> which suggested that the Adam and Eve story isn't about Adam and Eve failing, but about the distinction between humand and animals. Animals go by instinct while humans have <em>morals</em>; they have knowledge of Good and Evil.

<p>Tension is high in the family. Herb said to Jon, "is that the best you can wear to my wife's funeral?"
<br>In the car, Ma is snippyish and feels bad because we are late. "I just want to go faster; that's all."

<p>Fred and I are chillin' silently in the back. I am so thankful for my relationship with Manda where feelings are honored and welcomed, not bottled until they come out snippily.

<p><hr>

<p class=date>1:30pm Wednesday 3 February 1999</p>

<p>Service and funeral are over. At the service and eulogy part, I spoke before the group something like, "I remember Jean as so loving and wonderful and letting us be boys and do whatever boys do. We climbed up the huge tree and got muddy and she loved us no matter what. I have learned from her example and take this as a gift, teaching me how I might act toward other people in a loving manner."

<p>Funeral was in the rain - the fourth family funeral in a row in the rain: Monner, Grandad, Aunt Frances, Aunt Mercedes. I feel tired and a tad hungry.

<p><hr>

<p class=date>4:10pm Wed 3 February 1999</p>

<p>We've eaten now and are going back to the house.

<p><hr>

<p class=date>1:15am Thursday 4 February 1999</p>

<p><p>Slept then mingled at the main house at the reception type thing where we shared positive stories and stuff from like 6:30 to 10:30pm. We cousins helped clean up then I talked to Pete about life and stuff.</p>

<p><p>We laughed sadly at Buddy&rsquo;s response when someone approached him consolingly at the funeral, &ldquo;Buddy I&rsquo;m real sorry &lsquo;bout your mom&hellip;&rdquo; Buddy goes, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>We talked about plans and stuff. Pete hopes to have house and kids in 5 years. Wow.</p>

<p><p>Going to bed now.</p>

<p><p>Today Manda and I found a really cool thing at the post office.</p>

<p><p>For a long time, they&rsquo;ve had a stamp vending machine that takes bills (20s, 10s, 5s, 1s) and coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies, and susan b anthony dollars).  Some weeks ago, I found that I could purchase stamps with only pennies, a great way to spend them, and keep from having to roll them!</p>

<p><p>But today we were purchasing stamps with a bunch of pennies out of Manda&rsquo;s car&rsquo;s coin dish and I noted that the coins it gave back as change were not the same as the ones we were putting in. Hmmm. Therefore, it must simply keep track of how much change is owed, but not actually what coins were used.  Therefore, to return change in the most efficient and polite manner, it will give big change back and not a bunch of pennies.</p>

<p><p>Hmmmm.  How far can we take this?</p>

<p><p>It would be nearly too good to be true if we can put in 100 pennies, ask for change back and get dollar coins!  So we put in 4 nickels and 5 pennies and asked for change back and it said</p>

<pre>
           **************************************
           ****  NO CHANGE WITHOUT PURCHASE  ****
           **************************************
</pre>

<p><p>Dang. Oh well&hellip;  Wait! Okay, so we put in a bunch more coins (we were out of pennies) and wonderfully enough, ended with a total of $1.34 in the machine.  Most of it had been dimes.</p>

<p><p>Pressed <b>C 2</b> and ordered one 33 cent stamp and <em>ka-chunk ker-plink</em> 1 susan b anthony and 1 penny dropped into the change slot.  Beautiful.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ve got a whole pile of pennies to convert.</p>

<p><p>Manda called me after she finished working out at the gym on her side of town at like 8:33pm today. &ldquo;Do you think there&rsquo;s any way I can get to the museum by 9 o&rsquo;clock?  They&rsquo;re playing Beastie Boys laser light show.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Oooh. I didn&rsquo;t really think so, but we love the B-Boys.  &ldquo;Um, try it and I&rsquo;ll meet you at the ticket counter.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Actually, at my request Manda called me back some minutes later when she reached Fondren on Hwy 59. That was my indicator that she was the same distance (time-wise) away as me. So I grabbed my cell phone and camera and hopped into my car.</p>

<p><p>The first foreshadowing of the night was that I got nearly all green lights all the way.  And they&rsquo;re not synchronized to optimize traffic flow. They just all turned green for me. Except for 1, well actually 2, but out of 8, that&rsquo;s pretty durn good.</p>

<p><p>There was 1 (one) parking spot open for me to park. Just as I pulled in, Manda called my cell phone.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; we both asked.  Turns out she was only like 50 seconds behind me. I was all, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s really no place to park&hellip;. oh wait, except that these people are about to leave&hellip;&rdquo;
and a couple was just walking up to their car and could hear me trying to coordinate an open parking spot. Manda was just pulling up as they were getting into their car. The girl goes, &ldquo;is that her?&rdquo; to make sure Manda would get their spot. I was all, &ldquo;yes, thank you so much!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Manda pulled in and we brisked over to the museum. Up the steps, through the large entryway, and to the ticket counter. I pulled my wallet out as I smiled at the girl behind the counter, &ldquo;is there any way we can get Beastie Boys tickets?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, sorry..&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>And I was all, &ldquo;oh man, are you sure?&rdquo; and trying to flirt some tickets out of her or something and then Amanda was like tugging my chain wallet and I found myself walking backwards. &ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Come on&rdquo; she insisted.</p>

<p><p>I turned around and though I hadn&rsquo;t noticed, a guy who worked there had said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you in,&rdquo; and led Manda and I toward the planetarium door.  Whoah!</p>

<p><p>Whoah is right! He told the door guy, &ldquo;these guys are with me&rdquo; and we walked right in!  No tickets; nothin&rsquo;!!!!</p>

<p><p>B-BOYS BABY!!! and we didn&rsquo;t even have to pay or wait in line or anything!!!  He scoped out some seats and led us to them.</p>

<p><p>Manda asked his name (Kendrick) and we shook his hand and thanked him a bunch.</p>

<p><p>The seats we got were kinda off to one side and they weren&rsquo;t reclining seats, but man they were free and I loved it!</p>

<p><p>We actually had a significant amount of wait time in the planetarium before they started - like 4 minutes while the announcer guy said some stuff to kick off the show &ldquo;don&rsquo;t put your feet on the seats in front of you cause you&rsquo;ll kick someone in the head and they&rsquo;ll have to beat you up&rdquo; and &ldquo;as you watch the show, you may experience some queasiness, and if that&rsquo;s what you came for, then great, but if you need to leave, please exit through the front doors, but remember you won&rsquo;t be able to come back in; you&rsquo;ll just have to listen through the doors.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>The show was not astonishing-oh-my-goodness-absolutely-incredible, but for the price, it was pretty great. They played about 12 songs, spanning all the albums, but only &ldquo;Intergalactic Planetary&rdquo; from <em>hello nasty</em>.  They didn&rsquo;t play &ldquo;Paul Revere,&rdquo; which I sorely missed, nor &ldquo;Egg Man&rdquo; which woulda been great.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Brass Monkey&rdquo; &ldquo;Sabotage&rdquo; &ldquo;Whatcha Want?&rdquo; &ldquo;Fight for Your Right&rdquo; &ldquo;Flute Loop&rdquo; &ldquo;Girls&rdquo; &ldquo;No Sleep Till Brooklyn&rdquo; are all songs they played that Manda and I could think of just by memory.</p>

<p><p>Here are the rest of the songs we recognize that they played after going through all the albums:</p>

<p><p>From <em>Ill Communication</em>
&ldquo;Sure Shot&rdquo; &ldquo;Flutterman&rsquo;s Rule&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>From <em>Check Your Head</em>
&ldquo;Gratitude&rdquo; &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s Got to Give&rdquo; &ldquo;The Blue Nun&rdquo; &ldquo;Stand Together&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>From <em>Paul&rsquo;s Boutique</em>
&ldquo;Shake Your Rump&rdquo; &ldquo;Hey Ladies&rdquo; &ldquo;5-Piece Chicken Dinner&rdquo; &ldquo;Shadrach&rdquo; but they did not play the cool sample after Shadrach, so I&rsquo;ll include it here: &ldquo;for the best in mens&rsquo; clothing call Paul&rsquo;s Boutique; ask for Janice; their number is 718-498-1043. That&rsquo;s Paul&rsquo;s Boutique and they&rsquo;re in Brooklyn.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>The show was great, and included 2 encores. Oh and I took a ton of pictures (with no flash) during the show. I don&rsquo;t know how many, but probably 15 or 20. When we left, we looked for Kendrick to thank him, but never found him.</p>

<p><p>On the way home I had to stop for 5 traffic lights.  (Manda got lost in downtown for about 10 minutes&hellip;)</p>

<p><p>A few days ago, my machine locked up and then wouldn&rsquo;t reboot. It would try to boot, but where the boot manager would normally prompt with</p>

<p><p><pre>
LILO:
</pre></p>

<p><p>so I could type in whether I wanted to boot linux or Windows, now it just said</p>

<p><p><pre>
LI
</pre></p>

<p><p>and wouldn&rsquo;t do nothin.</p>

<p><p>Hmmm.. I was able to boot with a floppy, and even (thankfully) read all the info on this otherwise unbootable hard drive.  I had 2 other drives, so copied all the info I wanted to save onto one drive and took it out of the mix.</p>

<p><p>I tried every combination I could think of, used FDisk and Partition Magic and formatted and installed boot managers and everything, but I couldn&rsquo;t get it to go.</p>

<p><p>So I bought a new machine.</p>

<p><p>Actually I put it on credit card (ack).  $900 but it is a sweet sweet system:
<br><ul>
<li>PII 350Mhz CPU
<li>100Mhz ATX mainboard
<li>64Megs ram
<li>8Gig ide HD
<li>32x CD
<li>Voodoo Banshee video card with 16megs on it
<li>3.5 inch floppy
<li>56k internal modem
<li>Soundblaster card
</ul></p>

<p><p>All of the above components came separately, and my friend <a href="mailto:thomas@net-help.net">Thomas</a> helped me put it all together.  I used my current monitor, keyboard, mouse, speakers and all is good.</p>

<p><p>Okay, actually all is pretty good; last night the video card was killer awesome, but today a driver is screwed up or something and I&rsquo;ve only got 640x480 pixels and the fonts are <font size="+1"><b>this big</b></font>!! I&rsquo;ll call Thomas and see if he can help me out with that.</p>

<p><p>Yay new machine!</p>

<p><p>So I&rsquo;m catching up on email and stuff now.</p>

<p><p>Oh my goodness.</p>

<p><p>Though I was sicker than a proverbial dog, I lay in bed and visualized her winning.  Over and over I visualized Amanda winning Miss Houston 1999.</p>

<p><p>I had called her at 3 and told her &ldquo;you can do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I had called her at 6 and left a message, &ldquo;you can do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>The pageant started at 7pm, and I cried since I couldn&rsquo;t be there.  :&lsquo;(</p>

<p><p>I visualized her winning until I fell asleep.</p>

<p><p>I got a call at 10:30pm.  &ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>It was Amanda. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to believe it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You won.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Totally.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I love you, too.  But I gotta go take pictures and stuff.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Congratulations.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>And I went back to sleep.  Wow.  Amanda is Miss Houston 1999.</p>
