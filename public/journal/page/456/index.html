<p>Good morning from Sean Murray's apartment in OKC.  Thanks to
Tiffany for making phone calls last night to get me here even though
Sean is not.  I got to meet his roommate Johnny from Germany, who is
going to Nepal next year to teach English!</p>

<p>Didn't talk to him super much last night, but got here with no
problem.  Ironic is that while I was at Kinko's, I was like 1 mile
from this apartment.  Awesome.</p>

<p class=date>1:17pm</p>

<p>Cooked breakfast for Johnny the birthday boy today, who's now 20
years old.  Just went with him to Sean's grandparents' house and
chatted with them a bit before going to The Dive Shop, where Johnny
picked up gear to do his final open water dive to be certified this
Sunday morning at 8am at Lake Murray.  Now we're going to go ride
bikes.</p>

<p>I'm loving this!</p>

<p class=date>2:57pm</p>

<p>Tired; rode around the nearby lake a bit, and I noticed my energy
like whoah nearly sapped after a bit of an exertion riding up a bit of
a hill and climbing over a wall.  Maybe I shoulda eaten more than two
eggs and an apple.</p>

<p>Flew down a grassy hill from a highway overpass and trudged through
slightly tall grass up a slight hill.  I will keep up bike riding so
this slight exertion won't sap my energy so easily.</p>

<p>Johnny is talking to his peeps in German, very interesting to hear
him say "Hello?" to answer the phone and then "Alloh?" when he heard
German on the other side.</p>

<p class=date>7:05pm</p>

<p>Just ate dinner at a thai place with Johnny and his girlfriend
Sabra.  We were cutting up at the end and he offered me some of his
glass noodle enriched meal.  Then Sabra asked if she could have some
as she reached for his plate.  He was all, "I didn't say you could
have some," and she pulled back.  Then I reached over and offered her
some of his meal.</p>

<p>"So can I have some or not?" asked Sabra.</p>

<p>"Of course; he offered it to you and he's bigger than me, so what
am I going to do?" joked Johnny.</p>

<p>Also, on the menu were two interesting names of dishes:  "Noodles a
la Nick" and "Row Boat Beef and Noodles."  Amazing how YRUUers got
their names on foods in a thai restaurant.</p>

                        <p class=date>10:27am CDT Saturday 21 September 2002</p>

<p>Last night at the party Becky kissed me.  I resisted as much as I
could but it was not enough; it was like 3am when she started.  I had
been laying on this black futon on my left side when she sat near me
or something and I kinda grabbed her in a playful wrestling way and
then she kissed me, like full blown tongue kiss and I turned my head
away, again, and again, and was all "mmmm" "no" etc, but she grabbed
my face with her hand and faced it to her and we kissed.</p>

<p>I relented and we kissed a lot.  Deep deep deep tongue on tonsils
wonderful kissing.  She has perfect teeth and had a pleasant flavor of
mixed drinks that she had consumed throughout the night.  I was on my
back as she lay fully on top of me.  Other people in the room watched
or didn't, and some commented, but not in the way that I was afraid:
"oh my god I can't believe that 32 year old is kissing an 18 year
old."</p>

<p>She was all whispering, "let's go to the bedroom. I don't want to
be in public. It will be okay.  I'm not drunk, I promise." etc etc,
using every trick in her book (I imagine) to get me to .. oh, and even
"Okay, I'm going to get up and you're going to follow me, okay?"</p>

<p>I was all, "no no no" and "okay, we'll go outside, but I want to
talk first."  I wanted people to be able to see us not doing more than
kissing.</p>

<p>Out on the balcony she made "blah blah blah" hand motions at me
while I tried to explain to her that she's only 18 and I'm not going
to do more than kiss.</p>

<p>We kissed more and she ground on my leg and eventually Brian inside
closed the blinds and gave us privacy.  I was willing to grab Becky's
ass a bit and slurp on her neck.  She enjoyed biting while kissing,
especially my lower lip.  I'm sure she'd bloody it if we actually
fucked.</p>

<p>We quit for some reason and then I lay down on Johnny's bed and
soon enough Becky joined me and we kissed a lot more.  She has such a
pretty face.  What a lovely time.  But oh so many messages in my head
were saying this was wrong wrong wrong.</p>

<p>We kissed a lot lot lot on the bed and I was certain to have a
blanket between us the entire time.  She regularly moved my hands to
her breasts or ass and I routinely made a quick pass and then back to
the safety of her sides.  She was grinding her crotch on me so I moved
my hand under her vulva so the could grind on that.  She seemed to
enjoy it.  Never kept up the motion though; I wonder if she has ever
had an orgasm.</p>

<p>Part of me really really really wanted to give her one.  And if we
had been more completely alone in the apartment, I might have.</p>

<p>She pushed my hand down intoward her panties and after a few
iterations, I felt her up a bit with the back of my hand.  Not great
positioning, but hey.  She tried a couple times to twist my hand
around so the fingers would fit better, and I finally did feel her up
through her panties with my hand facing forward.</p>

<p>She lifted up her shirt and manuevered up so I could sorta kinda
kiss her breasts, though I was mostly kissing and licking cloth.  She
popped her right nipple out a bit so I could lick it some.  I
certainly would have enjoyed some more sucking, but no.  oh and she
had unbuttoned and unzipped her pants.. I said, "how are you doing
this to me?"</p>

<p>I flipped her onto her side on my right and positioned her so my
left hand could reach across me and finger her.  I didn't even really
insert my finger, but fondled her clit a bit and felt a little
wetness, but couldn't really get inside.  I imagine she is still a
virgin; she seemed really tight, or maybe I was just at a bad angle,
but I don't think so.</p>

<p>Her quiet breathing turned into quiet mmmms and sighs as I fondled
around her vulva.  (Oh what if I could have sucked and licked that
sweet little pussy...)  She never apparently orgasmed, and I think she
soon fell asleep.  She was relaxed and Johnny gave us fair warning
before he came in and she zipped up her pants.</p>

<p class=date>1:22pm</p>

<p>I've been visualizing her pretty face as I'm driving on the
turnpike from OKC to Tulsa.  I don't have a picture of her.</p>

<p class=date>9:54pm</p>

<p>I keep thinking of miss Becky's pretty face, thinking of kissing
her and her biting lip style of kissing.  Her straight hair hanging
down around her face over my face as we kissed and kissed.</p>

<p>And then what if Johnny tells Sean who tells Tiffany who tells
someone at OKC and it all gets blown out of proportion?  Sigh.  I
don't think I hurt her psyche.  She was in a lovely mood this morning
while my brain was all, "whoahaoahoahaah!!"  I asked her "how do
you feel about last night?"  "Fine!" she smiled a lot.</p>

<p class=date>10:21pm</p>

<p>Ha.  Tanner just got chinese for himself and me.  My fortune cookie
says, "you will attend an unusual party."  Postcognition?</p>

<p>Kris and I just rode bikes around Norman, leaving a note for Debu
on her door written on a guitar string packet with a pen that was in
the unlocked truck on her driveway.  We took turns each writing one
word on the note, but pretty much our handwriting looks equally
sloppy; a normal person wouldn't notice that two people had written
it.</p>

<p>Saw his friends Chris and Barret and their dog Porter, then rolled
back to Kris'.  We'll probably go find Laura and get ice cream on her
board plan and then do whatever.</p>

<p>The Real Frank Roesler Experience just called me and gave me his
number for when I make it into OKC, which will probably be tonight or
tomorrow morning-ish.  I think tonight is more likely.</p>

<p>At Debbie's I asked her for thoughts on the situation that Doug
brought up to me a few days ago.  She pretty much agrees with me that
I should still go to the rally, that we ought to build support in for
advisors who are part of the fellowship of the larger
congregation.</p>

<p>Her family chihuahua and ferret ran around the living room and
kitchen/dining area a lot.  Funny.  I felt a bit nervous that the
ferret would bite me, but he did not.</p>

<p>Frank Roesler called me this morning to confirm that I could call
him tonight anytime to bunk out with him tonight.  I rolled in to OKC
and called him, but no answer.  Called him again just recently and no
answer.  I will call Tiffany to see if she has other ideas.  I wonder
if I'll sleep in my car tonight.  I'm not likely to go urban camping
as Jack might, but the phrase still echoes in my mind.</p>

<p class=date>12:26am</p>

<p>Just called Tiffany; I'll meet up with them at Varsity Sports
Grill.</p>

<p>Happy happy with Kris and Laura in Laura's dorm after eating ice
cream at 31 Flavors.  What color is asparagus?  It's the 26th most
popular color according to Crayola's America's vote thing.</p>

<p>We walked up the stairs to the 12th floor to get to her dorm.  I
encouraged Laura to walk up them every day and she'll be in markedly
better shape at the end of the year.</p>

<p class=date>7:01pm</p>

<p>Tiffany and Shawn just came over as we were watching <em>Clay
Pigeons</em> Kris' favorite movie.  It was weird; I'm glad they got
the bad guy in the end.</p>

<p>Fun funny stuff rolling around laughing with all the old school
stories from YRUU/YA and neither.  Quite interesting to hear some
stories about peeps that I never would have guessed.</p>

<p>They are all going to a show now, and I'm going to the city (as
they refer to OKC, which is only 20 miles away), but first, oh yeah,
I'm going to say HI to Debu.</p>

<p>Here at Plano church to meet with Doug Strong at 2:30, and to get
my stuff and to fill out a criminal background check so I can get $
for driving youth to Tulsa.</p>

<p class=date>4:00pm</p>

<p>Apparently, the Plano church (?) adults sorta freaked about me
apparently being a youth advisor at Plano church, but not having gone
through the background check thing.  "Why is Rob hanging out with
these youth?"  and "Rob is too permissive with the youth."  Doug asked
them WTF that was supposed to mean, but got no answer.</p>

<p>So then he asked if any of them have talked to Rob.  No.  No one
has approached me to say they perceive a problem or anything like
that.</p>

<p>Doug went on to say that though the youth would want me to go to
San Antonio Rally, some adults might vote otherwise.  And that I might
just want to think about the outlandish idea of the possibility of me
not going to San Antonio Rally.</p>

<p>Realistically I'm like fuck that; this is my second to last rally
with these fantastic youth and I'm not going to not go to the rally
based on some rumor that someone has a problem with me not being based
at a church but they won't approach me with their concern.</p>

<p>To cover my ass I will contact Steve Feinstein to get his input,
but I really don't think he will see any profound problems with me
attending.</p>

<p>Okay, I'm at the Bibby's but about to leave for OKC after a shower
and packing my bike on my car.</p>

<p>Been recording Eminem Show to tape so I can listen to it a lot
while driving.</p>

<p class=date>8:42pm</p>

<p>Leaving.  I don't know why, but I'm scared.  So weird.</p>

<p class=date>10:31pm</p>

<p>Just talked to Veronica, Maggie and caught up on life ans such.
Just talked to Kris Scott who is in Norman; I'll call them when I get
there.</p>

<p class=date>11:45pm</p>

<p>WOWW!!!  This is so absolutely incredilbe!!  Lightnight lightning
lightning lihgtning all around, or mostly to the north and west of me
here in OK on 35 about 30 miles into the state.  ANd there seems to be
one spot where the lightning keeps hitting thre bround every so
often.  but it's just magnificent heat lightning up in the clouds with
some sparks fleeting across the sky in an incredible disply of
nature's awesome power.  So bright and dark and revealing the fine
lines of the clouds and another bold lasting rfor for a full second on
the groudnd and a spark across the sky.  Absolutely amazing.

and no thunder whatsoever.  None.  How can that be?  Is the air
already so heatd that this lightning doesn't displace more?  Is that
why it's called heat lightning.  ? 

What are those places that keep getting hit by boltds??

THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THAT CAT WAS SATYING THAT A VIDEO CAMERA IS MORE
IMPORTANT THAN GAS!!!!!!!!!!!

Aw FUCK I would love to record a video of this.

Apparently it happens not infequently, according to a guy who stopped
right after I put on my flashers and stopped; he wanted to make sure I
was okay and we chatted about the lightning some.  So b eautiful.  

Oh and I shouldn't forget to metntion that there is a consisten wind
about 20 mph with gusts up to 40 maybe going almost directly north,
assuminging I 35 is going north

thing is that the lightning seems to be getting ever so closer though
I'm just standing here outside my car.  Perfectly dry air with maybe a
hint of ozone, but I might b e making that up.

Big trucks flying past me maybe they have seen this a million times.

Thank you god for such a fabulous show.

<p>Back in my car now, 165.7 miles traveled so far since Dallas.</p>

<p class=date>12:50am</p>

<p>I'm in Norman now, at Kris's house also with Laura Douglas who was
here studying.</p>

<p>"Hello?  I was thinkin' about ordering pizza."</p>

<p>"Hey, I think you got my name spelled weird there.  It's Kris, yeah
the A is an I."</p>

<p>POURING down rain with water pouring over the street, and campus
all flooded.</p>

<p class=date>2:35am</p>

<p>Fun stuff with Big Poppa Kris buying pizza from Papa Johns.  Laura
and Kris have decided they need a curfew so they won't destroy one
another's school lives.  2am.  Only half an hour late tonight.</p>

<p>Just went through all my SWUUSI pics.  Good stuff.</p>

<p class=date>2:42am</p>

<p>"Are you scared of spiders?" I asked Laura, as I noticed a small
spider on her jeans leg.</p>

<p>"Aahh!!" and she jerked and swiped it off.</p>

<p>Kris: "If it's smaller than a person then Laura is scared of
it."</p>

<p class=date>12:20pm Thursday</p>

<p>Kris and I just saw a kid run across the street with his can of
pringles during Norman High School's open lunch.  Three cars were
headed his direction during the event.  Funny.</p>

<p>He made it and soon as he got across started chomping pringles..</p>

<p>We cheered.</p>

<p>We slept in a bit and then I dropped off Janette at her antique
space while I visited my mom at her condo.  Talked about the latest
haps for a couple hours and then I went back to get Janette.  We
visited Barton Springs and chilled (pun intended) in the water a bit
and then ate at Trudy's.  Invited Fred to join us, which he did after
he woke up and he entertained Janette with Fred-stories until he
cruised to school to do homework.  Janette and I walk walk walked and
found a cooler worth of ice discarded on the street, where we cooled
our footses for a bit.  Then visited the restrooms in a Baptist church
across the street.</p>

<p>Visited Amy's Ice Cream, which she has never been to before and
parked at Fred's apartment then walked to campus where we got online
and I chatted briefly with Asha, Ashley (sorta), Phat Pat, Tanner,
Sean, Suzanne and checked my email and downloaded my livejournal
friends' entries.</p>

<p class=date>1:28am</p>

<p>Janette got a ticket when we were just a few miles from Dallas.
That sucks.  The cop-girl was all, "I clocked you going 70 in a 50 mph
zone with a laser radar from one thousand seven hundred ninety-five
feet."</p>

<p>Wow.  That's amazing.</p>
