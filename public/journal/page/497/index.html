<p>I just spent a few minutes looking for the NO BEGGING image, and
now I'm going to continue my inspired work on the GSU technique for
getting this survey done.  Sometimes I wish I could show off the types
of things I'm building, but it's all proprietary and copyrighted and
all that kind of shit.</p>

<p class=date>8:32am</p>

<p>I just got pulled to creating another version of the branded survey
I made for the peeps in Singapore before my trip.</p>

<p class=date>9:45am</p>

<p>Okay that is finished, but I found a slight bug in the code.  I've
got to track that down and see what's the dealio.</p>

<p class=date>11:41am</p>

<p>Bug is found; bug is fixed.  I think actually my code was fine and
it's SAS that needs to be fixed, but whatever.  It works now.</p>

<p>Just got back from lunch with Kristen; we went to Hobbit Cafe.
Amazingly different environment and work-load that she experiences at
the senator's office than what I experience here.  It seems.</p>

<p>I have begun to install Spam Assassin on my site.  Maybe I can
become more spam-free this way.</p>

<p class=date>9:22pm</p>

<p>It seems to be working the way I want.  Now my cheerful.com address
is filtered through Spam_Assassin on robnugen.com and if it passes
muster, it is forwarded to yahoo.com</p>

<p>If this proves to work well for me, then I'll probably stick with
Yahoo and not switch to Lycos for email.</p>

<p>Last night I got a call from Char, a woman I met
throgh church many years ago - like when I was 10. 
she has bee a sort of spiritual
mentor/cheerleader/guide over these years. 
conersations with her seem to always fill me to
overflowing with goodness.</p>

<p>I had called her a couple days ago after my <a
href='https://www.thewealthsource.com'>personal
coach</a> encourage me to get in contact with someone
who could act as a spiritual mentor for me.   Char is
the first person who came to mind.</p>

<p>Char was 100% supportive of my intended travel to
Japan; she agreed that I need to go
<em>experience</em> these other cultures, far away
places, just as Bryn and I did recently.   Some people
are content to just read about places to, but I have
to <em>go</em>.</p>

<p>Such a great blessing and uplifting connection with
Char!</p>

<p>Got to sleep around 11pm.</p>

Brynsies!

So great that you got your flight; thanks for letting me know. :-)

I hear ya about being super busy; I have been AS well, and after two days of
not a lot of work, I'm about to get movin and groovin to get some stuff done
around here.  I have mostly gotten my sleep back inline with this timezone.
Lee-eh was so funny last night, she said I have to "reset my brain watch"
and I was all, "????" and then "oh!  internal clock!!"   So funny!


I have done a bit of research on Japan, and found a testimonial site that
gives some presumably good sound info on what it takes to "make it" there as
a teacher.  Step 1 is bring $5000, or at least to be prepared to spend 5 Gs
to get set up.  Lee-eh confirmed that last night when I talked to her about
it, so I'm leaning more toward accepting her offer of accomodations with her
fam when I arrive!

Thank you for taking the time to write.  It makes me feel loved, and I
smiled bigly to be greeted with this email today.  :-)

I love you!!

    - Rob!

oh!!  Thanks for the birthday wishes!  I didn't celebrate, but a few people
called me even so.  Maggie called to wish me a happy 11668th day (I think)
Heehee!  she's so great.   I'm looking forward to my 12000th day on 31
January 2003!!!  Whoohooooo!!

Subject: HAPPY LATE BIRTHDAY!


Rob,

sorry I haven't written or called, life has beAn
pretty hectic for me the last couple days and I am
only taking a short break from writing to send you an
email (i haven't even written Vessy since i've beAn
home!)

i caught my flight and made it home safely.  i have
only beAn offered $4000 a year at Richmond when is
hardly enough, so i am trying to persuade them into
giving me more, but for now i am still planning on
making it my new home.

i got my pictures developed, some are good, some are
bad, but they are all fun!  i will try to bring the
best ones to plano so you can see them too!

have you caught up on your sleep yet?  i haven't had
much time to, but i will, i'm sure!  how was your
birthday?  i hope it was great!  i wanted to call you
but i didn't get home til late last night and i didn't
have a chance :(!  but know that i was thinking about
you all day!

i am going to definitely be at plano if only for the
sake of presenting the yac restructuring resolution.
hopefully YAC will support us, but anyways, i will see
you there!

thank you so much for going with me to Europe, i had
such a great time, and every experience was so
amazing!  What an awesome adventure!  I still haven't
heard from Graham, but i assume he got our note and is
still breathing?!

anyways, i need to get back to writing but thanks
again, so much!

i love you heaps!

you are a great great friend to me and you will always
be in my life!

smiles and love,
me

<p>This is my optimal environment, or aspects of environment that I would
love and feel energized living within.</p>

<p>My bedroom is only accessible via a ladder or a rope swing, and a
small portal of some sort.  The hand holds are just the right size for
me to use.  Any guests have to be determined to enter before they'll
be willing to go to such extremes.</p>

<p>In my room there is no phone unless I take my cell pone with me.</p>

<p>Outside there are craggy bluffs and a hill or valley, with bushes and cacti
and trees to climb.  Big open area to play frisbee, open enough to throw, if
not open enough to run and catch it.</p>

<p>Wind blows friskily through the trees an around the bluffs, allowing for fun
lofting frisbee games.</p>

<p>My house has paints and brushes on one wall, and people are invited to
create art on it.  One other wall is left only for me to create upon.  The
guest art wall is photographed and thereby archived when it gets full, then
is repainted white or some silly sponge yellow or light gray.</p>

<p>Windows have stained glass art in them.  Maybe it's fake stained glass, just
painted.  yes; I need some of that.</p>

<p>One other wall has a water fountain built in, with tubes that people can
move around to bring water to the top, and make different configurations of
splashable water cascading pools on the way down.</p>

<p>This might have to be outside.</p>

<p>The doors are often open, and always unlocked.  My bike is attached
to the wall, ready to roll at any minute.  As well as my skates and
frisbee, a hackey sack, and kite maybe.  There is a room for crafts,
which always has a project ongoing.  paper clock is finished and on
the wall.  Marble track has its own table.  Other random projects are
around.</p>

<p>healthy snacky food is available from everywhere.  something I can
just snack on indefinitely.  and water is close at hand as well.  fish
tank built into one wall, maintained by my fish tank maintainer, not
me.</p>

<p>one room has books and beanbags in it.  and pillows.</p>

<p>After an non-inspired 3/4ths day at work, I was called into Kevin
and Karla's office.  I jumped up from my desk and stepped into their
office and they asked me to shut the door.  I immediately thought,
"please kill me please kill me," because I've been so miserable doing
crap work the past day and 1/2.</p>

<p>"Are you having trouble getting back into the swing of things?"
they asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. totally"</p>

<p>And the conversation got better from there.  They asked what I
would need in order to be interested/inspired to work, and it came
down to me not wanting to do this stupid stuff because I've already
done it before; I need to show someone else how to do it, or find a
better way of solving this.</p>

<p>So I showed Minh what I was working on, not to pawn it off on him,
but to help generate some ideas or find a better way.</p>

<p>He mentioned that it could be solved with the GSU code, which I
designed about 9 months ago, and he implemented.  Except we needed a
way to handle radio buttons.  The GSU currently can only handle text
fields and text area boxes.  Not radio buttons nor drop down lists.</p>

<p>We brainstormed a bit, and I came up with a solution.  Coded a demo
version in SAS in about 5 minutes.  Oh yes.  That rules.  It worked
perfectly, and we can use the GSU model to write this otherwise lame
survey.</p>

<p>Last night after being inspired at work to get some work done, I
rode home, talked to Spot, ate a snack, then rode to Dude's house to
catch up after my trip.</p>

<p>He wasn't home, so I slept on the back patio until he arrived about
40 minutes later.</p>

<p>Pizza delivered, optimized-for-web my 501 pictures from the London
Paris tour, slide show on Dude's big screen TV for Dude and Gene.</p>

<p><img src='/images/peeps/Gene/no_begging.jpg' align=left> Gene and I rolled over
to my house where I gave him his magnet that I imagine he can use
while preparing delicious meals.</p>

<p>We stayed up chatting for about an hour, mostly about future plans
and such.</p>

<p>He left, and I got to sleep around 1am ish.</p>

<p class=note>(Dream)</p>

<p class=dream>I went back to work at Kroger, back in
Tomball it seemed.  I had just arrived we they were
all, "okay, whoever does the best work helping to
clean up he store will get a prize of some sort."</p>

<p class=dream>I had noticed that on top of the
display cases was enough dust to keep me busy
collecting dust for a while.  So I searched briefly
for a broom and a bucket to collect dust in.  I then
went to the aisle of the store where they might sell
those dust picker upper things (static cloth) and I
found gloves instead.  I found some relatively nice
gloves for $8, which I decided that I could use later,
so I would buy them.</p>

<p class=dream>Put them on and climbed up onto the..
actually there were steps available to climb up the
first couple of feet - items like a upside down bucket
and a stepstool randomly left by the end of the
display case so I climbed easily up on top and found
that the guy who had bee working at Kroger 15 years
ago was still working at Kroger, ad I didn't really
like him then, but I was willing to get to know him
this time and not immediately continue to dislike him.
 He had had the same cleanup idea as me, but he had a
mop instead of a broom, and making a terrific mess of
all the dust because the top of he case was made of
plywood or particle board, so it was soaking up the
water.  He also got sidetracked doing something else,
so he wasn't even working on cleaning up the dust.</p>

<p class=dream>We talked a bit about the new vantage
point from up on the display case; we could see
customers doing silly hings and watch other people
work.  I was sweeping the dust into a pile at the end
of the row and I noticed that my gloves kept coming
off, or I was taking them off and not remembering
it.</p>

<p class=dream>I swept a pretty big pile of dust into
a pile and put on my gloves to begin putting it into
the bucket.  I noticed something like carrot
shreddings in the pile and asked him what they were. 
They were from the small potted plants on the top of
the case that were losing their thin leaves.  Ah. 
that makes sense.</p>

<p class=dream>Walking below us a manager lady was
all, "do you have anyting to do?"</p>

<p class=dream>"no," I stated plainly as I filled the
bucket.</p>

<p class=dream>"then you can leave."</p>

<p class=dream>"What? I was just kidding! gee I
thought it was obvious given that I'm putting a huge
pile of dust and grass clippings into this bag."</p>

<p class=dream>She continued on her way.</p>

<p class=dream>So I was dumping all this grass
clippings and dust into the bucket, and the bucket was
full before I finished, so I had my friend get another
bag or something to put the rest in.  I had a grocery
bag (paper) to pile some in,  but it had some old
clothes in the bottom.  I gave these clothes a mental
blessing  that they would be found by someone who
could use them, but then I had a sense that I sould
not put them in there and I asked my higher self, and
I saw a snake nearby on the forest floor on top of the
freezer case in the store.  I noticed there were
actually three snakes there, and I got out my camera
to take a picture, which I did, and I think it came
out well on the second shot.</p>

<p class=dream>I noticed some more snakes hanging from
the branches of these large pine trees, and walked
cautiously so I wouldn't step on or otherwise
encounter a snake; I didn't know if they were
poisonous or otherwise aggressive.</p>

<p class=dream>I noticed that this freezer case seemed
wider than it had been; used to be that I dould walk
to its edges in a few steps, that I was a bit
concerned about falling off.  Now it was a forest with
a huge grassy plain beside it.  I found an old linux
book from about 1970, which had a description of
procmail as a techniqure for getting rid of spam.</p>

<p class=dream>I began to flip through it as I walked
toward the train, and as reading the book, noticed
that the words were not making sense, and woke up.

<p>So I've been given a task that seems trivial to the requestor (or I
imagine it could seem trivial): "notify the user if they miss any
questions when they fill out the survey like you do on the other
survey."</p>

<p>Thing is, the code behind these two surveys is dramatically
different, designed with different features in mind.  The one that
they've seen before can skip questions depending on the user that is
filling out the survey, and can notice what questions were skipped.</p>

<p>The other survey type can span multiple pages, can skip questions
depending on previous answers given, can have questions displayed as
drop down lists or radio questions.</p>

<p>One trick in determining if a question was missed is in the user
interface part of it.  If we have multiple pages, should the questions
be numbered 1-n, (n+1)-m, (m+1)-o, on subsequent pages, or just 1-n,
1-(m-n+1), 1-(o-m+n+1)?  God this sucks.  I can't even easily explain
what is the problem, much less solve it in the general case.</p>

<p>I did some research on Japan, and I have been assured that it's not
as easy as just "go to japan and get a job teaching english."  It will
require like $5000 US cash to get set up, and all kinds of pitfalls to
be avoided.... I'm now more inclined to go visit first, and/or go with
Lee-eh so I have a place to stay while I get set up.</p>

<p>But right now I'm going to go to Walgreens to get envelopes and
mail registration for Plano rally.</p>
