<h2 id="09-13-tuesday-06-june-2017-jst">09:13 Tuesday 06 June 2017 JST</h2>

<p>Lin cooked lovely breakfast for me, by cooking an egg into some
already-made vegetable soup.</p>

<p>The soup was too hot to eat immediately (because it had just been
boiling), and it reminded me of all the times she has reheated food to
scalding temperature.</p>

<p>From my point of view, the food is already cooked; there is no reason
to reheat it at all, much less beyond the point that it can be eaten.
I see it as a waste of time and energy heating it up just so it can
cool down.</p>

<p>I have mentioned this before, and it is a point of contention for us.</p>

<p>From her point of view, I do not appreciate what she does to prepare
food for me.   From my point of view, she can do <em>less</em> and I would
actually be happier.</p>

<p>This morning I said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand why you make the food too hot
to eat.&rdquo; She got kinda mad but explained she had to cook the egg
within the soup.</p>

<p>I said &ldquo;Oh, thank you.  I did not realize that you had to cook the
egg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For me, that would by the end of the conversation, but she told me
how I always get upset that she cooks, but that I do not realize that
there is an egg in the soup (this time).</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand that you cooked an egg in it this time.  Thank you. I did
not realize that before, but I realize it now.  Thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She said something again about me not understanding.</p>

<p><em>Oh goddammit I am pretty sure I understand.</em>  (I did not say that, but
I thought something like that.)   &ldquo;I only said it because I thought
you just reheated it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This time I cooked an egg in the soup!&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>NO FUCKING SHIT MOTHER FUCKER JESUS FUCKING CHRIST I GOT THAT.</em>  (I did
not say that.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but sometimes you do just reheat, so I said something&rdquo;</p>

<p>「もういい、ロブちゃん」and she left.</p>

<p>There were two packages of peanut sembe on the table.  I crushed both
of them to powder, one in each hand.  I was surprised how easily they
crumbled.  Fucking poison non-food. why does she keep buying fucking
garbage to eat?  I yelled with rage into the room, away from mama&rsquo;s
room because she was home, but fuckit I am not holding this in
anymore.  Collapsed onto the ground and yelled cryingly into the
floor.  FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU</p>

<p>Mama came in and asked what was up, then left when I said it was
nothing. 「なんでもない」</p>

<p>I remained on the floor a bit longer until the perfect time balance
between getting it all out and cleaning up, having enough time to
explain to her mom, and explain to Lin before I had to leave to meet
Caroline.</p>

<p>I cleaned up the crushed peanut crackers, dumping them into the trash.
I put the soup Lin made into tupperware (along with more from the pan)
to have for my lunch.  I put that into a plastic bag so it won&rsquo;t leak
and then put the bag on the stairs so I wouldn&rsquo;t forget it.</p>

<p>Mama was praying at her alter when I told her that it was nothing to
do with her, nor with Lin.  She guessed it was because I was sick and
she felt better.</p>

<p>I went up to see Lin who was meditating on her meditation pillow.  I
sat next to her for a moment and said something like &ldquo;thank you for
all the work you do to prepare healthy food for me.  I hope you can
understand that my anger is really nothing about you, but is related
to past life stuff.  I have remembered two past lives that &hellip;&rdquo; (here
I was not sure how to finish the sentence.) &ldquo; that are related to not
listening.  One time my friend died because he did not listen to me,
and one time I died because I did not listen to my family..  Thank you
for being so brave to be with me this lifetime while I deal with this
issue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes I think I am not the right person for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are the perfect person for me.  Within a month of meeting you I
wrote in my diary that you are the one. And I am staying with you. You
perfectly allow me to look at this problem.&rdquo; etc blah blah for a
minute, including legit crying.  How the fuck can she be so loving to
stay with me despite my being horrible?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you have a problem with anger.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>oh my jesus christ bitch have you not been listening to me?</em>  (I did
not say that.)  &ldquo;Yes. I get that.  I just said that.  I have been
looking at this issue and will continue to look at it.  It is related
to probably 500 past lives.  Thank you for offering me the chance to
look at it this lifetime.  I plan to ask Caroline the best way to deal
with it, and I will absolutely do it if she has an answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lin hugged me for a bit, and then bade me well on my way to meet her.</p>

<p>Put my computer into my bag, along with rain gear, and headed out.</p>

<p>On the way walking, I realized I forgot to take Lin&rsquo;s soup for my
lunch.</p>

<p>fuck</p>

<p>Then I realized I had forgotten to bring my folder of shit for Tokyo
Men&rsquo;s Circle tonight</p>

<p>fuck</p>

<p>Got to the station on time and got on the train.  Got a seat which is
nice so I could do a bit of prep work before meeting CB today.</p>

<p>Train arrived and left on the platform opposite me.  I missed my
fucking train.</p>

<p>Thank fucking angels for the little details; I had planned to arrive
early.  I will arrive 2 minutes ahead of schedule assuming I get off
at the correct station, which is in two stations from now.  And I got
to write all this to air my dirty laundry in my online journal.
Hopefully it benefits someone somehow.</p>

<h2 id="11-17-friday-09-june-2017-jst">11:17 Friday 09 June 2017 JST</h2>

<p>Okay, it has been some days since this happened.  The session was
Caroline helped resolve the issue in a huge way.  I have (for the past
N+1 years) said I get pissed off when I think people don&rsquo;t listen to
me.  This drives my behavior to not speak up, etc.</p>

<p>Caroline helped me notice there is something deeper.  In The Case of
The Hot Soup, she helped me note that there was fear lurking under the
anger.  Fear that I won&rsquo;t catch the train to make it to my appointment
on time.  But even deeper, sadness lurking under the anger.  Why
didn&rsquo;t I feel this cared for when I was little??</p>

<ol>
<li>I met Caroline, who seems to be a soul I&rsquo;ve met in previous lifetime(s)</li>
<li>Two men might join Tokyo men&rsquo;s circle, which would put us up to 5 (cause it seems <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> men have stopped coming)</li>
<li>A woman is interested in joining Tokyo co-gender circle.  That will put us up to 7 if all 6 people come next time.</li>
<li>Tokyo Men&rsquo;s Circle meetings are on 1st and 3rd Tuesdays each month.</li>
<li>Tokyo Co-gender Circle meets on 2nd and 4th Tuesday each month.</li>
<li>I am the contact person for both</li>
<li>We have had two (2) co-gender group meetings so far.</li>
<li>The short term plan is to keep going and keep inviting new people into the circles</li>
<li>Medium term goal is to find enough people interested in learning how to do facilitation that it makes sense for us to have a facilitation trainer come in and teach for a weekend.</li>
<li>Long term goal is to have women leaders lead the co-gender circle as a women&rsquo;s circle</li>
<li>Vision is to reduce the number of suicides in Japan by giving people a safe place to talk about their feelings.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m on the local train now headed home from CB</li>
<li>We are planning to switch their servers over to new servers tomorrow.  Hopefully it will go smoothly.</li>
<li>I plan to do final testing tonight; I need to compare a buncha URIs on each server to make sure the content is exactly the same (JSON).</li>
<li>Yay(?)</li>
<li>Before the great server-swap, I plan to meet Caroline for a private session.  I have kinda been thinking of questions but have not written them down yet.</li>
<li>* How can I act more loving toward Lin?</li>
<li>* Am I on track with current diet or should I be even more careful than recently?</li>
<li>* What did you mean when you said I was healthy?</li>
<li>* How can I align my heart with income?</li>
<li>* how much time should I spend on Marble Track 3?</li>
<li>* What else are you inspired to tell me?</li>
<li>I am currently level 24 in Pokemon Go.  I plan to get to Level 25 so I can zoom through a bunch of Evolutions while I have a Special Egg or whatever.</li>
<li>I have not touched iOS apps with Tariq for a while; they are well overdue for updates.</li>
<li>I have been working on Marble Track 3 each Tuesday, though I probably will <em>not</em> work on it tomorrow.  I am making a choice to meet with Caroline and then do the server upgrade with CB, which will probably eat up all my time before I-group.  Boo hoo to a degree, but I really think I should have had the upgrades done by now, had shit not gone awry.</li>
<li>Oh, so anyway, MT3 so far has zero (0) photos taken for the stop animation portion.  But I did buy a nice camera..  ohhhh that is what I can do.  Between CB and Tokyo Men&rsquo;s Circle tomorrow, I plan to go buy a tripod for the camera.</li>
<li>I bought mypowercircle.org and authenticcircles.org about 10 days ago, but have not put anything on them.  I will probably end up using tokyo.mypowercircle.org and let the other domain go bye-bye.  Thanks to Paola for (correctly) suggesting that a real domain is better than a Facebook Group.  More legit, more exandable, more reassuring, more work, more fun.</li>
<li>I have been sort-kinda steady-state low-key studying Japanese, taking up to three (3) lessons per week.  but during server upgrade madness, I had not been doing homework. I did a teeny bit of homework before recent lesson with Fumiko.</li>
<li>庭にワニは鶏を食べた。Why has no one offered me this variant? I just made it up after hearing some other kids practice the conventional version.</li>

<p>We are in a kinda weird place with CB.  They are moving to a new
server / dev team.  Fair enough.  I knew it would not last fo-eva but
as of now, I am updating their servers to new Ubuntu at the same time
they are planning to shut down these servers in favor of different
servers run by a different dev team.</p>

<p>I survived the lesson pretty genkily; we had a discussion about what
it means to be Japanese, and of the original list from which we later
culled about 2/3rds of the items, we had</p>

<p>Japanese people</p>

<ul>
<li>believe they are Japanese</li>
<li>grow up in Japanese school system</li>
<li>like to wait in long lines</li>
<li>watch NHK on New Year&rsquo;s day</li>
<li>are proud of Mt Fuji</li>
</ul>

<p>That last one intrigued me; I had not predicted it.</p>

<p>I feel a bit tired this morning, and am not too sure how I will
present today&rsquo;s material; it depends on how long the discussion of
&ldquo;What does it mean to be Japanese&rdquo; goes.</p>

<p>Egad I am falling asleep.</p>

and m.CB and api.CB before making the new CB server handle live traffic.</p>

<p>(written 07:39 Monday 05 June 2017 JST)</p>

<p>Two weeks ago, I chose the location for Caroline&rsquo;s presentation
yesterday.  The setting worked out quite well, for those people who
were able to find it.  Seems that a couple people were lost in the
park.</p>

<p>Lin came to the lecture as well.  yay!  I&rsquo;m glad she really enjoyed
it, and could witness some of the reactions people had (crying) when
meeting/greeting Caroline.</p>

<p>I met Michael for the first time that night, and Jorge for the second
time.  I saw Cozmo in the audience for a bit, but he left before I
said HI to him.</p>

<p>Michael and I chatted for a bit, and he seemed to understand the value
of men&rsquo;s groups, saying that he has been in some.  He may join Tokyo
men&rsquo;s circle.  Jorge may join as well.  Today I want to send them some
info on the group.</p>

<p>Jorge, Michael, Rohini, Lin, Miho, Lisa, and I walked Caroline to her
station where she and Michael left our group.  The rest of us walked
to a restaurant, but Jorge headed home once we found a place.  Rohini,
Miho, Lisa, Lin, and I ate a burger place where they had sample cup
sizes with fake ice.</p>

<p>I tolk Miho and Lisa about the co-gender authenticity circle and they
seemed interested in attending.</p>

<p>Yesterday in my online men&rsquo;s group I used my time to look at why I get
so unreasonably pissed off when I have to repeat myself.</p>

<p>Guided via questions, it went something like this.</p>

<p class="dream">Where do you feel this anger?</p>

<pre><code>In my throat, like it is lodged in there.  A solid steel ball
blocking everything.
</code></pre>

<p class="dream">Does this solid steel ball have a temperature?</p>

<pre><code>Cold. everything is cold, like in the middle of snow.
</code></pre>

<p class="dream">Who is there with you?</p>

<pre><code>I am alone.  They left without me.  Actually I got lost.  I didn't
stay with the group and I got lost. &lt;tears&gt;
</code></pre>

<p class="dream">Who found you?</p>

<pre><code>No one. I died. &lt;sobbing&gt; I fucking got lost and I died. They
told me to stay with the group but I did not listen and I died.
</code></pre>

<p class="dream">Okay, what does this part of you need?</p>

<pre><code>To be found.  To be loved.
</code></pre>

<p class="dream">Okay, can you come back to your present self?</p>

<pre><code>Yes.
</code></pre>

<p class="dream">Can you offer him that love he needs?</p>

<pre><code>Yes.
</code></pre>

<p class="dream">Does he believe you?</p>

<pre><code>Yes.  He sees that I came back for him, and he is now safe.
</code></pre>

<p class="dream">What is his message for you?</p>

<pre><code>The world is a wide and wonderous place.  There are so many neat
things to see and he wants to show me.
</code></pre>

<p class="dream">Can you do that with him?</p>

<pre><code>Yes.
</code></pre>

<p class="dream">What would that look like?</p>

<pre><code>There is a park on a hill near our house and we can go up there
together.  He can show me what he wants to show me.
</code></pre>

<p class="dream">When will you do that?</p>

<pre><code>I will go with him twice this week, before our next meeting.
</code></pre>

<p class="dream">Are you complete?</p>

<pre><code>Yes.
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p>The very same day, I started to get scratchy throat.  My the time I
had a lesson 12 hours later, I was sore throated and feeling sick.
Slept all day yesterday and told Rohini via FB that I had an
interesting story to tell her.  Soon thereafter I was shivering
uncontrollably and got into bed with extra blanket.</p>

<p>Extra blanket was too hot after a while, and when I woke up around 2am
this morning, blood did not go to my brain and I passed out while on
the loo.  Appparently my eyes were open but like glazed over.  Lin was
saying &ldquo;please come back&rdquo; when I came back to consciousness.</p>

<p>wow. I just got (what feels like) a huge bonus from AWS.  I broke CBs
website and had to ask AWS to help resolve it.  But to ask them, I had
to pay for support.  But it&rsquo;s CBs account, so they charged <em>him</em> to
support my error.  And due to the way support is billed, AWS bills the
next month in advance, so AWS billed CB <em>twice</em>.</p>

<p>I explained to AWS that I had wanted to put the support cost on <em>my</em>
credit card, and asked if there was any way to do that.  He said &ldquo;I
will do you one better; I will take care of the fee and leave support
on your account for the rest of this month.&rdquo;</p>

<p>wow wow wow so thankful.</p>
