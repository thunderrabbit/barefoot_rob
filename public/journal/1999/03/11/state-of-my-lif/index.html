<p><p><b>STATE OF MY LIFE</b></p>

<p><p><ol></p>

<p><p><li>I&rsquo;ve been pretty busy with actually working for a change of pace.  Dude and I have been pulling cable (installing telephone and data cable into offices) for a friend, and have been doing some website stuff.  We&rsquo;ve got a client who would like us to build a site on which he can maintain a database so he can access it from the web.  We&rsquo;ve never done something like that, but we&rsquo;ll learn how.</li></p>

<p><p><li>Plans are moving forward for <em>Rob&rsquo;s Rollercoaster Roundup</em>.  This, as you may or may not know, is my large full color coffeetable book of many many coasters that I will ride beginning this summer.  So far I have purchased a scrap-book-sorta-thing to make the template for the real book, and have an Six Flags Astroworld Season Pass, which will allow me to enter any Six Flags park this summer.  Cool!!  Astroworld opens on this Saturday.</li></p>

<p><p><li>I&rsquo;ve been enjoying DJ stuff at KTRU!  Today I had to turn on the station, as there had been no DJ there from 1 to 4am this morning. I had my trusty DJ Manual to figure out how to turn the transmitter on, but I couldn&rsquo;t make sense between the book and what I was seeing on the console. Some of the buttons the book referred to were there, but many were not.  Hrrmmmmm&hellip;  I spent literally like 12 minutes not being able to get it started.  (How does one turn on a radio station??)
<br>I was just about to call the DJ Director when I saw a small note on the bulletin board by the console.  It said something like
<br><pre>
          TO TURN THE STATION ON:</p>

<pre><code>  we now have a silence detector hooked to the transmitter
  to turn on the station, just turn on the mic and speak
  into it. You should hear your voice over the monitors.
</code></pre>

<p></pre></p>

<p><br>Ack. ohmygoodness that was easy.  I turned on the mic and <em>bing</em> the station was on.  <em>YIPES!!!</em> I didn&rsquo;t have a disc ready to play or nothin&rsquo;!  Certainly no one heard me log on, though; there had been static for the previous 3 hours (unless they had heard the previous DJ state that the station would be back up at 4am and tuned in specifically to hear that.)
<br>Unfortunately, due to my not being ready and stuff, I didn&rsquo;t record on tape my debut Station-Turn-On-Sequence.  Oh well.  I thought about doing the sequence again and recording it, assuming no one was listening anyway, but chose not to.</p>

<p><p>I did relatively well this time, and felt more comfortable on the mic, but not perfectly so.  I recorded most of the times I was on air, but (ironically enough) didn&rsquo;t record the ones where I made errors, because I was in the process of making errors and not turning on the tape. I&rsquo;ll get this figured out soon.
<br>if you don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m on Thursdays from 4-7am CST, also on the web at <a href="https://www.ktru.org">www.ktru.org</a>
</li></p>

<p><p><li>I put $1500 into the stock market. Actually I have the dollars in an account waiting for the IPO of FlashNet to be sometime next week I believe.</li></p>

<p><p><li>OH OH OH!!!  Many people have been calling me from all over the country, but they&rsquo;ve all reached the wrong number.  ??  I finally got a guy to tell me what he was trying to call.. A bank&rsquo;s 800 number has apparently been pointed to my home phone!!  I don&rsquo;t know how long this will last, but email me if you want the number.</p>

<p><p>I called my local phone company who tracked down the phone company that owns the 800 number (and who is charging the bank for calls made to my house).  I called the 800 number owning company, but can&rsquo;t get through.  &ldquo;All of our agents are busy; please leave a message&hellip;&hellip;..  &hellip;.This mailbox if full.&rdquo;  [click]</p>
