<p><p>This is cut-n-pasted from an ICQ chat I just had with a friend of mine.  It includes an exorcism, so don&rsquo;t be surprised&hellip;</p>

<pre>
[Baron Munchausen] accually... there has been this "thing" that comes around when ever i go outside... even when i walk to the store... its there..
[thunderrabbit] like what kind of thing?
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] like a "im going to kill you and eat you " thing...
[thunderrabbit] is it a physical thing?  or a sense of doom you get?  
[Baron Munchausen] phisical
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] is it like a giant dog or a giant bear or giant rabbit?
[Baron Munchausen] more like a "giant human"
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] oh.  So is this person able to communicate on a humane level or does this giant human just want to eat you?
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] well  when im asleep... it speeks to me in my mind.. like it wants me to join it...
[thunderrabbit] So when you are sleeping is it like in your dreams like Freddie Kruger or is it just a voice?
[Baron Munchausen] well.. a voice.. very strong voice... and its not just when im sleeping.. also when im awake...
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] is this for sure the voice of the giant human?
[Baron Munchausen] a giant human for sure... when it talks to me in my head when im awake... i can see it... 
[Baron Munchausen] like it is right in front of me...
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] i dont know.. i can see it with my eyes but when i get closer to it (because it is im my path) it disapears or something...
[thunderrabbit] is it physically in front of you?  
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] Hmmm.. does this only happen when you are at Arlene's area?
[Baron Munchausen] acually.. it started when i got onthe buss for ar-kansas
[Baron Munchausen] ive come to except it that i cant get rid of it
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] so was there a person on the bus that did it?
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] i dont know... when i got on the buss, this man bumped into me and threw something on me... like dust...
[thunderrabbit] Hmm.  Are you able to communicate with your higher source or positive guiding angels or any of your positive helpful spirit guides?
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] type what it says.
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] i never tried... wait  its saying something right now..........frank... as you can see me and here me, i will come to you soon... we will be reunited once again.... i will clame you as my son once again... we will never part untill the apocolips arrives again...
[Baron Munchausen] 
[Baron Munchausen] wow.. 
[Baron Munchausen] its gon
[Baron Munchausen] 
[thunderrabbit] ask it why it is there.
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] ok  hold on... man... why do you communticate with me so...
[Baron Munchausen] why do you want me so much that you are willing to drive me crazy...
[Baron Munchausen] 
[Baron Munchausen] frank.... i am not trying to "drive you crazy", just reinstate you to your natural self... you are my son and i want to be reunited with you again... when this happens... thoes people will see that seperating us was never the right thing to do....
[Baron Munchausen] 
[thunderrabbit] what people?
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] the people of the earth...
[thunderrabbit] all people on earth?
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] where are you from?
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] how were earth people able to separate you, someone so powerful that you could travel so far?
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] when were you separated?
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] how long has frank been on earth?
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] Is Frank currently inhabiting a human form?
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] where is your human form?
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] oh, you believe you also inhabit Frank's human form.  is this correct?
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] Do you realize that you are driving Frank crazy?
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] Frank believes that he started hearing from you when a man on the bus to Arkansas blew dust on him, or sprinkled it.  What do you know about this dust?
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] Frank is currently in a human form.  How long has he been in this form?
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] so how long has Frank been in this current human form?
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] What is the reason that Frank is in this current human form?
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] What is the reason that you required 17 years to find the dust from your planet, if you have been on this planet since the beginning of the planet earth?
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] how could you not know?  
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] So does he take on a series of different human forms?
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] I don't understand "for not that I had found him"
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] If that is the case, it seems to me that this is the first human form in which you have actually found Frank and have been able to communicate with him.    Because I hear you saying that now that you have found him, he will not take on another form.
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] Are you willing to wait patiently until Frank's form dies before you are reunited?
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] Are you willing to not communicate with Frank until his form dies?
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] Would it be enough simply for you to watch him?
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] Frank:    I want to talk to frank for a moment.   is that okay?
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen]  yess... me and my son are not of this earth... my name is Lothose and i come from a planed 100 light earth light years from here... i come here for my son...i have been travleing for a long time... i was not sure how the people seperated me from my son... but we will reunite once again...befor you created your fictonal god...in your minds...since time when earth was created.... we came here to see what the universe has created...yes... and so do i... to keep him at peace...i do not understand...no... i have a form that i use... when i am near him...i am not "driving him crazy"... this is his natural state of being...the "dust" used was of my planet... i found him and wanted him to remamber his origianal place of birth... and this was the only way i could communicate with him in his state of humanicity...his current form.... he used it after his form befor that had come to itsend...exactly 17 years...to exist...it was not needed to find... i had aqired it and upon its arivle 16 years ago... i did not know that he had taken on this form...in human life... it starts and it stops... he has taken on so many forms that it was hard to find...once the form he has taken right now is nolonger in use then frank will take on another form if it was for not that i had found him...well, if had not found him... he would of taken on a different form once his current form "dies"...this is correct... when his current form extiguishes it self... then we will be reiunited...yess... no this would not be alowed... i must stay in contact with him untill his form dies ...no...yess...
[Baron Munchausen] 
[Baron Munchausen] alsdkf;alskdfjalsjfa;l
[Baron Munchausen] 
[Baron Munchausen] 
[thunderrabbit] how do you feel?
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] yes.  I am here.
[Baron Munchausen] rob you there...weird... 
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] hold me 
[thunderrabbit] I got you.
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] oh rob... what just happened...
[thunderrabbit] can you see what was typed?
[Baron Munchausen] wait... let me read it...
[Baron Munchausen] I AM THE SON OF THIS ... THIS.. THING...
[Baron Munchausen] and i am to join him once i die...
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] is this true..
[thunderrabbit] That is what he says.  I have no idea.  Is it true?  I'm asking you.
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] i have no recolection...
[thunderrabbit] I asked for Lothose to not communicate with you, but that's when he said "no this would not be alowed"
[Baron Munchausen] really..
[thunderrabbit] Yes.  I can email you the whole dialogue, including my questions, but since he did not press [enter], you will just get his answers in one big as jumble, I think.
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] would yo like me to email it to you?   to what address??
[Baron Munchausen] yess i want to lookk over your questions to...
[Baron Munchausen] i dont know  i have 7 of them
[thunderrabbit] choose 1 address and give it to me; I don't know any.
[Baron Munchausen] how about.... wait... CyboricMathGod!@yahoo.com
[Baron Munchausen] that one
[thunderrabbit] which would be th
[thunderrabbit] hang on.
[Baron Munchausen] wait... its wrong... he made it wrong...
[Baron Munchausen] Its  CyboricMathGod1@yahoo.com
[Baron Munchausen] he made me press "Shift" when typing the "1"
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] okay.   I sent it.   
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] I WANT MY SON... YOU HERE... I WANT MY SON...
[Baron Munchausen] wow..
[Baron Munchausen] he wants me bad...
[thunderrabbit] I hear that you want your son.  You have waited since the beginning of earth; I believe you can wait another less than 100 earth years.
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] what on earth are you talking about...
[Baron Munchausen] really
[Baron Munchausen] interesting
[thunderrabbit] Lothose said you and he have been on earth since the beginning of earth.  he's been basically chasing you from body to body until he found you in this current incarnation as Frank.
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] well...that is very interesting and all but i think he is right...
[thunderrabbit] right about what?
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] well... ever since i was born... ive had these dreams that i did not belong... that i was different..
[Baron Munchausen] that is why i joined the uni church... i thought that thoes people were just like me...
[thunderrabbit] Hmmm.  How do you feel about this new information?
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] i dont know... i mean... here ive been told that iv been on this earth for millions of years and im suposed to just agree with it...
[thunderrabbit] I believe I've been on earth in different forms for millions of years (I typed bil at first so maybe it was billions) but I have no awareness of someone trying to track me down.
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] you to.... that is very paculiure..
[Baron Munchausen] really
[thunderrabbit] I actually don't think it is so strange; I believe most humans are on earth for many or thousands of lifetimes in a row.  
[thunderrabbit] yup.
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] but what about the "comming from a different planet " thing...
[thunderrabbit] I believe that life can exist on millions of different planets, and that we are souls inhabiting these temporary bodies.  Our souls are eternal and cannot die.  The bodies die so we choose a new body once the old one dies.  We are free to choose bodies on different planets as well.
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] yess... but am i "Human"
[thunderrabbit] you are a soul inhabiting a human body.   I believe all "humans" are actually souls just temporarily inhabiting a human body.
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] but what about the "apocolips" comming 
[thunderrabbit] I am not sure to what he is referring about apocalypse.   if in fact the "end of the world" is near; (year 2000 craziness ... christ coming to earth  armageddon... all that kinda stuff then maybe that's what he's talking about)  if it fact it is near, I'm excited about it (not that I want it to end, but that kind of excitement would certainly be something amazing to experience (as a soul inhabiting a human body, instead of as just a soul watching from afar)
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] welll it cant be crist comming because he said " your fictional god"
[thunderrabbit] I think that he was referring to the Christian god that many US citizens "believe" in.
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] hhmmmm...
[Baron Munchausen] i just dont get it..
[Baron Munchausen] i dont know what to do...
[thunderrabbit] I am not sure what to tell you, but I believe you have a purpose and that just by believing you can know what is the right thing to do, you will know.
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] so.... do i "follow" my "dad"
[thunderrabbit] I would not think so.   He has been doing fine for billions of years.  I say wait until you are complete with this human form.  
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] what would it mean to follow him?
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] well he talks about joing him... do i forcfuly not follow him or do i just jump in front of a train and go with him...
[thunderrabbit] I believe you have a purpose to be in the Frank form here on earth.  For you to end that form prematurely would keep you from fulfilling that purpose and you would just have to do it again ( "do it again" means reinhabit another form all the way through its natural end)
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] well once this form is gone... then their will be no more forms... i will be with him
[Baron Munchausen] personaly...
[thunderrabbit] how do you feel about that?    no fuck that question.   I don't think it's true that you will be with him.  
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] but how do you feel about the possibility?
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] i like being here... and i feel that i have a right to stay alive and love...
[thunderrabbit] YES!   And I like you here!
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] but he is promising
[Baron Munchausen] and apenently he is my fauther...
[Baron Munchausen] 
[Baron Munchausen] 
[Baron Munchausen] 
[Baron Munchausen] 
[thunderrabbit] He could be any entity claiming to be your father.  I believe the only father (and I don't think that the masculine gender is correct)    the only life force is GOD=THE UNIVERSE=LOVE  and there are some entities that want power or something, but that "want" is not in the LOVING best interest of other entities.
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] well... ive never heard it llike that...
[Baron Munchausen] but why would he want me...
[thunderrabbit] He could be just picking on hundreds of humans until he drives one crazy enough to jump in front of a train.
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] I totally encourage you to gently ask him to not bother you again.  He is unwanted in your life and you expect him to leave you alone.   You have that power to simply ask him out of your life.  He must obey.. YOU have the body..  Discarnate spirits don't have the bodies and that is what they want.    Simply ask him out of your life in the most gentle way (ask gently and politely) and he will leave.
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] but i was starting to like him
[Baron Munchausen] 
[thunderrabbit] Well it's up to you.   At one point you said he was driving you crazy.    You always have free will.   You could probably ask him back later if you wanted the company again.     It's totally up to you.
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] but i am crazy it is what i stife to be... not insane crazy but... ya know...
[thunderrabbit] I do understand.  (I call it weird when I refer to my own version of crazy)
[thunderrabbit] I will not give you an answer on whether you should or should not keep him in your life.  I am simply making you aware that you are in control..  You can ask him to leave or stay.   
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] well... hhmmmmm... i think that i do not need another voice inside my head right now... i already have enough...
[thunderrabbit] Then gently and expectantly ask him to leave you alone.
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] ok  hold on...
[Baron Munchausen] 
[Baron Munchausen] person.... leave me alone... please..
[Baron Munchausen] 
[Baron Munchausen] I CANNOT DO THAT YOU ARE MY SON...
[Baron Munchausen] 
[Baron Munchausen] GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HEAD .
[Baron Munchausen] 
[thunderrabbit] Lothose.  Go to the light.  You are an discarnate spirit on earth.  Go to the light and the love and the universal peace.  You deserve peace.  You deserve love.   Lothose close your eyes and visualize yourself into the light and the love of the universe.  Allow yourself to leave earth and the physical plane and go to the light and the love of the universe. 
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] what light are you talking about... i see only dark...
[thunderrabbit] Lothose knows what light.  
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] Lothose you were created by the universe and the universe will embrace you back into its arms of love.  You simply need to let go of earth and the physical plane.  You have guiding loving spirits that will help you.  They are around you now and you can leave earth and go to the loving light of the universe.   Your spirit guides will lead you there.  Allow them to let you go to the light.  
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] Good by Lothose
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] I hear that you believe I will be sorry.  I look forward to meeting you in the future.   I send you only light and love and wish you peace.
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] Thank you Lothose.  Good night.  You may leave now.
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] no... I see only dark... i refuse... but if you want me to leave my son alone... then i will go.... but for a short while.... i will be back when his phisical form has terminated... then... then you will be sorry.. good by for now... but here me out... you will see me in the future and you will pay for making me leave my son... and i send you these words... fear me... my son will be my predisesor and he will clam many of you... including you...i shall do so...
[Baron Munchausen] 
[Baron Munchausen] 
[Baron Munchausen] wow... he is gone.. but in the future...
[Baron Munchausen] what then
[thunderrabbit] I have no fear of death.  I have no fear of Lothose or any discarnate spirit.  I am a powerful spirit and have the loving power of the universe and all my angels backing me up.  
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] i amnot afraid of death either... and not of him but what i will do once he come back...
[thunderrabbit] Good.  Simply ask him to leave again.
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] I believe he will not be back.
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] no.. im saying that when he come back that i willl have to "fill his shoes"
[thunderrabbit] Once you are dead (once the physical form you are inhabiting is dead) you will go to the light and not to the Lothose.
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] Don't worry about him bothering you.  If he tries then just simply have him leave.   If you need help with this, go to a psychic who can help cleanse you.
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] i wont worry now... not untill i am dead and gone...
[thunderrabbit] Fair enough.
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] well then...
[Baron Munchausen] how is the weather there...
[thunderrabbit] It's pretty nice.. a tad cool at night, but I don't have to use a blanket.
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] Just a sheet is enough.
[Baron Munchausen] of course not...
[Baron Munchausen] i love the cold... i trained for the "Poler Bear" club and i cant wait to join
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] HAHAHAAaaah   what are the requirements for this club??
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] well... not sure... i know diving i 60 degree water is one...
[Baron Munchausen] it doesnt sound cold but trust meit is...
[thunderrabbit] 
[thunderrabbit] I've experienced water that cold.  I know it is.
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] but i love it...
[thunderrabbit] We had a polarbear club in college.  There was a bridge club:
[thunderrabbit] Swim underneath a small bridge on the big fountain on campus.  The Polar bear club was to do that in the winter
[Baron Munchausen] why not
[thunderrabbit] and I joined both clubs.   I did not join the naked bridge club or the naked polar bear bridge club.
[Baron Munchausen] i under stand
[thunderrabbit] Just because I didn't want the possibility of being arrested for that.
[thunderrabbit] 
[Baron Munchausen] but i plan on joining the national club soon...
