                        <p class=note>(transcribed from my diary)</p>
<p class=date>1:46 pm Saturday 24 July 1999</p>

<p><p>Got to Dallas Love and ran, following the signs to American Airlines.  Walked down a tunnel thing, up a ramp thing, back down a thing and suddenly didn&rsquo;t see any more signs for American.  Crap.  Back up the thing and back down and asked someone.  Turns out I had been going the correct way in the first place.  This sure wasn&rsquo;t well marked.</p>

<p><p>Around a corner, through a security gate, up a small escalator, finally to the American counter.  Presented my ticket, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to get to Des Moines.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry; you&rsquo;re at the wrong airport.  We only have flights to Austin.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Fuck.</p>

<p><p>I slumped.  Okay, where do I need to go?</p>

<p><p>The guy was pretty pessimistic about me making the flight; I only had 30 minutes to get there.  But I had to go for it.  Back down the little escalator, where the security guys were all, &ldquo;? huh ?&rdquo; and I told them the situation.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You might be able to make it if you grab a cab,&rdquo; they offered, plus, &ldquo;good luck!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Trudged back up the hill, down the hill and let me promise you my bags weighed a million pounds.  No wheels, no shoulder straps.</p>

<p><p>Out toward Passenger Pick Up and found the cabs were not availble there, but somewhat further down the sidewalk.  A baggage handler offered to drive me there in his cart.  So very appreciative I was and tipped him a dollar once my bags were in the trunk of the cab.</p>

<p><p>Told the cabbie my plight and he drove 75 or 80 miles per hour toward the other airport.</p>

<p><p>Unfortunately I didn&rsquo;t know what gate, and my bags were inaccessible in the trunk. I considered calling American on the phone, but they hadn&rsquo;t been able to give me gate information previously, so I didn&rsquo;t try this time.  I knew the second flight to Des Moines left from Gate C 26; the guy at Dallas Love had told me that.  So I assumed Gate C for the earlier flight I was trying to catch.</p>

<p><p>Tipped the cabbie 5 bucks for a total of $30.  Hauled my bags back out of the trunk, and hauled up to the monitors.  Found an American Airlines desk before I found a monitor.  Wrong terminal.  My flight was leaving in several minutes from gate A18.</p>

<p><p>My shoulders and hands were killing me, but I ran, hoping to find someone driving an electric cart.  I couldn&rsquo;t run more than 50 yards, and had to settle for a fast walk.  Fortunately they had moving sidewalks which helped some, but my arms were still burning.  Finally I found an electric cart willing to go my direction.  He was on break eating fries and a shake, but said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I had made it to A26 from C26 in DFW.  I&rsquo;m not sure how far that is, but it&rsquo;s pretty far.  To A18 we drove, zipping around people and stuff.  Got to the gate.  Missed my flight.</p>

<p><p>Now I really wanted to cry. Instead, I payed the electric cart guy 2 bucks and he drove me to gate C34, from which the later flight would leave.  I couldn&rsquo;t believe how far I had walked!  I confirmed the flight information and called the Youth Council emergency number to let them know.</p>

<p><p>In review: verify flight information before leaving.</p>

<p><p>That is how I missed my flight.</p>
