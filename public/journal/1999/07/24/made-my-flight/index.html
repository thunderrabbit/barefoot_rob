<p class=date>11:15am Saturday 24 July 1999</p>

<p><p>Oh my gosh.</p>

<p><p>Packed last night and finished up this morning and Wende drove me to the airport.  Dropped me off in plenty of time and I went in and the line for American was suuper long!!  Stood there for a minute but it wasn&rsquo;t moving so I decided to go straight to the gate.  Found the monitor for departures and could not find my flight.  Check my flight coupon.</p>

<p><p>Oh god.  Wrong airport.  I was at Intercontinental (IAH), and had to be at Hobby (HOU) in like 40 minutes.  It&rsquo;s way further than that away.</p>

<p><p>Thought about just getting a cab but I really wanted to cry and didn&rsquo;t feel comfortable doing that in front (or behind) of a stranger.  Called Wende.  Bless her heart she drove back and got me and drove over the curb to the next lane to get out of the airport faster.  I cried for a second then I could think more straightly.  Wende did most of the good thinking though.  First off, we were low on gas.  She offered to just try to drive all the way, but I encouraged her to get a little bit so we could for sure make it.</p>

<p><p>I called American Airlines and it took <em>forever</em> to get to talk to a person.  Finally someone answered and I was all, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m about to miss my flight; can you help?&rdquo;  I explained the situation: My goal was to get from Houston to Des Moines today.  I had a connecting flight out of Dallas at 1:30pm.  AA had another flight out of IAH, but it was delayed until 12:45; no way to make it to Dallas on time.  They had nothing out of HOU, but encouraged me to go there since my original flight was from HOU.</p>

<p><p>Called Southwest Airlines.  A person picked up on the first ring. They had a flight out of HOU into Dallas Love at 11:30 for $89.  Fully refundable if I make my other flight.  Great.  I gave her my name and she began to make the reservation. Then suddenly <em>click</em> My phone disconnected.  Aw crap.</p>

<p><p>Called back.  A different person picked up on the first ring.  &ldquo;Hi I just called but got disconnected,&rdquo; &ldquo;what were you trying to do?&rdquo;  I gave my name and she found my reservation.  I was about to give my credit card information when, <em>click</em>.</p>

<p><p>Grrrrr.  Called back.  A different person answered on the first ring.  Explained everything and this time we did it.  Got a reservation for flight 22 leave HOU 11:30 to LUV at 12:20 and was on standby for flight 20 11:00 to 11:50.</p>

<p><p>Once I had the ticket, Wende and I pondered my luggage situation. I had 3 bags and usually can only carry-on 2.  I trusted that they would just let me do it.  Wende suggested that if not, I could maybe ask American to check my bag all the way through to Des Moines so it would just get there the next day. Hmmm.</p>

<p><p>Got to the airport and walked toward terminal A.  Going through the security check thing the lady was polite but said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll need to check that bag.&rdquo;  Oh please no.  My bag wouldn&rsquo;t fit in the &ldquo;your bag must be checked if it won&rsquo;t fit in this box&rdquo; slot, so I unzipped one end of the bag and put it inside my other bag.  She said that should work.  I was all, &ldquo;see I can&rsquo;t check my bags because I&rsquo;m trying to make a connecting flight in Dallas.  If I check them, I won&rsquo;t make it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re going to Dallas?  You&rsquo;re in the wrong terminal.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Oh no.</p>

<p><p>Her thought was confirmed, so I headed toward terminal C.</p>

<p><p>I did not look forward to going through another security thing. They didn&rsquo;t stop me though, so I zipped straight to the gate for flight 20. Explained that I was on standby for the flight and the woman was all, &ldquo;oh yes there is plenty of room on this flight.&rdquo;  I began to explain my luggage situation but she interrupted, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry; just get on; we&rsquo;re leaving in 3 minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Down the jetway I ran and the guy took my boarding pass. (Number 61 for those keeping track; it was a small flight.)  He was all, &ldquo;would you like to check that?&rdquo;  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really want to, but I can&rdquo;  &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re trying to catch a flight?  No problem.&rdquo;  (I didn&rsquo;t mind in this case; since I made the earlier flight, I&rsquo;d have plenty of time in Dallas to get my bags.) Got on and the stewardess helped me stuff my bags in the overhead bin.  Made it.  Called Wende on my cell phone during the several seconds before they shut the door and we left.  Thank you thank you.</p>

<p><p>That is how I made my flight.</p>
