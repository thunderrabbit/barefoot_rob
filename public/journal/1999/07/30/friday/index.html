                        <p class=note>(transcribed from my diary)</p>
<p class=date>2:17am Friday 30 July 1999</p>

<p><p>I feel sad.  I did not make Steering Committee.  SC is the executive body that serves Youth Council, voted by and from members of Youth Council.  Waiting for the results was almost excruciating.  Even though we were singing songs and stuff.</p>

<p><p>Mandy enjoyed her secret buddy stuff today.  Geoff sang &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet&rdquo; to her on guitar, and she loved the picture that was the result of the scavenger hunt I set up for her.  It&rsquo;s a pic from last years Con Con of Mandy and Nora together.</p>

<p><p>Interesting about not making SC:  Micaela had been on the list to run, and I looked forward to working with her.  She removed her own nominatation at the last moment.  She said later, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m going to run next year, [so maybe we&rsquo;ll be on SC at the same time then.]&rdquo;  Hmmmm.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m tired as anything.  We&rsquo;re leaving tomorrow; I wonder if I&rsquo;ll have time to type up stuff in the computer lab here on campus.  (We&rsquo;re at Graceland College in Iowa in case I haven&rsquo;t mentioned that.)</p>

<p><p><hr></p>

<p><p>4:30pm Friday 30 July 1999</p>

<p><p>The wheels on the bus go round and round as we drive to Des Moines.</p>

<p><p>After sleeping in and packing and doing laundry (the sap came out of my sleeping bag nicely), we did a Carwash today for closing worship:  small groups all massage one person at a time and say nice things about them while massaging.  Very empowering and wonderful.</p>

<p><p>At closing, we each received personalized awards.  I got the Award For Loving Roller Coasters!</p>

<p><p><hr></p>

<p><p>3:10am Saturday 1 August 1999</p>

<p><p>We are at First UU church of Des Moines tonight. We got here around 5pm and have been just hanging out and stuff. I talk talk talked with youth in small random groups, actually mostly listened to their happy playful banter. I showed the pics I have from Con Con last year and gave a few away to people who would enjoy them.</p>

<p><p>I have spent about 5 hours now (not continuously) working to type up all my diary entries so far and am now caught up.  Yay!</p>

<p><p>Wende arrived at 1:45 am with 4 youth from our district: Ashley R, Bryn C, Lauren D, and Jeremy L-N.  Actually Jeremy is a young adult in our district, but still young enough to attend Con Con with us tomorrow.  They drove 11 hours (including breaks) from Ardmore, Oklahoma today. I think everyone is sleeping now.</p>

<p><p>Super duper extra special thanks to Mandy for letting me use her computer to get my journal entries written!  I am glad to have them done now and saved to floppy so that I can easily put them on the web when I get home.  Good night.</p>
