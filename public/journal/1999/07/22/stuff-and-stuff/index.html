                        <p class=date>22 July 1999</p>

<p><p>I entered 3 pictures into The Big Show, an annual art show here in Houston.  I don&rsquo;t know if they have been accepted yet; I&rsquo;ll find out by Friday.</p>

<p><p>On this coming Saturday, I&rsquo;m going out of town for 2 weeks.  Both weeks will be in Iowa for <a href="https://www.yruu.org">YRUU</a> stuff.  First week is for Youth Council, like the US Senate, except for YRUU.  Second week is for Con Con, a week long conference for youth, same as Con Con last year, except in Iowa.  (it moves each year)</p>

<p><p>Over the past couple of days, I&rsquo;ve been working on a project for another art show&hellip; it&rsquo;s seemed like a project:  I&rsquo;m having slides developed out of prints that I&rsquo;ve already taken.  The slides are needed to enter this next art show, and are due on August 4.  A quick look at my calendar and I realize I am quickly running out of time, since I&rsquo;ll be out of town past August 4th starting in 2 days.  Yikes!</p>

<p><p>Special thanks to Laura and the crew at <a href="https://www.wolfcamera.com">Wolf Camera</a> for their help.</p>

<p><p>Speaking more about pictures, my friend Jennifer has offered to scan some pictures for me since I obviously haven&rsquo;t in a while.  I wasn&rsquo;t able to get my scanner to work on my Windows machine in a while, and haven&rsquo;t found linux drivers for the scanner.   If you know where I can get linux drivers for a Microtek ScanMaker E3 Plus, please <a href="mailto:robnugen@flash.net">let me know!</a></p>

<p><p>Speaking of linux, I met a dude named Jeffrey yesterday who also has linux on his PC, and even has a 50 megabit connection to the internet. Whoah!!  I met him yesterday at the laundry mat and it turns out we both know Cathy Crawford, an independent Flashnet representative like me!</p>

<p><p>Speaking of Flashnet, I have been handing out way more business cards lately than before (previously I&rsquo;d been handing out almost none) and surprise my sales appear to be going up!  I even gave my card to some cops downtown while I was skating!</p>

<p><p>Speaking of skating, I found a group who skates consistently twice a week!  Like 15 or 20 miles per night!  Oh so so so exciting and they actually meet only 2 blocks from my apartment, so I can just skate over and join them.  Truue!!!!!</p>

<p><p>Speaking of truue, today I&rsquo;ll be at KTRU from 1-4, covering Robert&rsquo;s shift.  Right now I&rsquo;m meeting Robin for lunch and then KTRU then pictures to Jennifer to scan, then Flashnet meeting tonight.  Big fun all day!</p>

<p><p>Oh, more about KTRU..  when I was there on Tuesday, near the end of my shift, kT came to see me!  She&rsquo;s one of my local youth.  She was all silly smiley and announced, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got worms!&rdquo;  referring, of course to the gummy worms she had as a snack.  We laughed and ate worms and played &ldquo;The Bumble Bee Tuna Song&rdquo;  Big fun.  Yay!</p>

<p><p>ps: I just got an <a href="/web_stuff/funny_classics/destroy_earth.html">article</a> that I think makes an interesting statement on our state of technology.</p>
