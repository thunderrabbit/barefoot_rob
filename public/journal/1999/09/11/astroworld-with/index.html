                        <p class=date>11 September 1999</p>

<p><p>On Friday night around 9pm, my brother Fred left Slidell, Louisiana for Houston to say HI to family and friends before going to Stanford for school.  He drove for a few hours, slept 5 hours, got to my apartment at 8am Saturday.</p>

<p><p>A few hours later, we were at Astroworld.  I&rsquo;ll omit the detail about crappy traffic due to some sporting event at the Astrodome.</p>

<p><p>We both have Six Flags season passes, and we&rsquo;ve both attended several different parks this season.  He&rsquo;s attended more than I, but I did see Six Flags Great America in Chicago while he did not.</p>

<p><p>I had great fun bantering with him in line, talking about coasters and similarities, cool variations, the best, oldest, fastest, newest, most inversions&hellip;  We cracked each other up with old and new jokes and fairly entertained or maybe annoyed the people around us.</p>

<p><p>Started at Serial Thriller, which I&rsquo;ve ridden about 6 times, but he had not yet. I put him in a right hand seat (we didn&rsquo;t wait for front seat) so he could experience the thrill of thinking his leg might get wacked at a particularly close-looking encounter with another part of the track.</p>

<p><p>It was cool, but the line too long for us to wanna ride it again, so we headed to Viper.  Rode Viper about 5 times in a row, usually without waiting for a train, just off then run around and back on same train, or not even have to leave the station and just change seats.</p>

<p><p>Viper begins its descent through a tunnel, and Fred noticed that just outside the tunnel, there is a track that is <em>really</em> close and maybe he could hit it on the way down!</p>

<p><p>He asked one of the ride ops if he could do it (not asking for permission, but if someone could possibly reach the other track).  The ride op didn&rsquo;t know but said, &ldquo;try it!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Around that moment, I got a call on my cell phone.  It was Kristen.  I was all practically yelling, &ldquo;yeah we&rsquo;re at Astroworld and Fred is about to try something cool on Viper!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>While still talking to Kristen, the ride started and I narrated while we rode and described Fred&rsquo;s endeavors.  Down through the tunnel zoom <em>whap!</em> he got it!  &ldquo;Whoo hoo!!&rdquo; we shouted with glee through most of the rest of the ride.  He showed me his hand all greasy smeared and a bit red. We hopped triumphantly off the ride and Fred showed off the grease.  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try it; it hurts a lot.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>As we walked to the next ride, I explained to Kristen everything that had happened, then hung up with her as we skipped Texas Tornado which was out of service probably until Fright Fest in October.  Doh.</p>

<p><p>Then we also skipped XLR8, which was the first suspended ride of its kind when built, but now it&rsquo;s so outdated that I&rsquo;ve heard this is its last season.  I&rsquo;m greatly looking forward to some HUGE and INCREDIBLE coaster in 2000!!!</p>

<p><p>To Greezed Lightnin&rsquo; where we rode it about 8 times in a row, in various seats, in various apparent moods:  &ldquo;Poker Face!&rdquo; and we would sit upright and blank stare straight ahead the entire ride.  &ldquo;Sleep!&rdquo; and we would feign sleep the entire ride.  It&rsquo;s a shuttle loop coaster; the entire ride is only like 35 seconds.</p>

<p><p>While on that ride, we met some woman and her kid, for both of whom this was their first time to ride.  We were all, &ldquo;you gotta put up your hands!!!&rdquo; and we demonstrated for them, waving to the  small crowd that often gathers below the loop. They (new riders) were fun.</p>

<p><p>Then to Batman the Escape, where the line was pretty darn short, but Fred wasn&rsquo;t super impressed with the ride so we only did it once.  Funny thing was Marcel called me and I almost got to talk to him while on the ride but the ride ops wouldn&rsquo;t let me.  Oh well.  One coaster-phone-call is good for a day.</p>

<p><p>Then Ultra Twister, which was ho hum; I&rsquo;m still kinda upset they wasted such an amazing design potential on an essentially 2D track. Fred tried to be all, &ldquo;well it&rsquo;s the first of its kind blah blah blah&rdquo; but I&rsquo;m not really buying it.</p>

<p><p>Then to Texas Cyclone, which we rode once in the front seat of the back car and once in the front seat of the front car.</p>

<p><p>Coolest thing about that is when we got off, they have pictures available that were taken while we were on the ride.  Some kid in the very back seat spray-spat some kind of water just at that moment; it was a very cool effect to see captured on film.  Good timing, man!</p>

<p><p>Then we were pretty much hot and bored, so we left.</p>

<p><p>This time the traffic was even <em>worse</em>, as the same sporting event was now finished and flooded the streets with cars again!  Augh!!</p>

<p><p>We made it out though, and joined Wende for lunch at Taco Bell. Yay!</p>
