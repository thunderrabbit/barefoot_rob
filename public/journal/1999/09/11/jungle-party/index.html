                        <p class=date>11 September 1999</p>

<p><p>About a week ago, Jennifer and I planned to go to Numbers last night.  &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to Numbers!&rdquo;  &ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Numbers is a dance club in Houston that plays loud tunes to a crowd of 500 to 1000 per night, and sometimes has bands perform.  Music is always wonderfully dance-inducing.  In my case it induces Rob&rsquo;s Crazy Dance.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Rob's Crazy Dance</b>

<p>I don't know how to Swing, or Tango, any country line dances (except The Chicken Dance), or Two Step, or um, any of those dances that I don't know, I can't do.  And I don't really want to.

<p>But I can do Rob's Crazy Dance.  It's not good, or even cutting edge stylish; I just let my appendages flail to the beat.  The faster the music the better; the fuller the sound the better; the louder the better.

</blockquote>

<p><p>KTRU has exposed me to lots of different music besides just rock.  I no longer enjoy just plain ol&rsquo; rock, and especially not grunge, or glam rock or even rock rock.  I love Jungle, Techno, House, Breakbeat, turntablism.. stuff one may hear at raves or parties.</p>

<p><p>En route to Numbers, I had KTRU on.  It was Friday between 10pm to 1am, so KTRU broadcast the specialty show called MK Ultra.  That means that Tejus is in charge of the radio part of the radio, and a rave DJ spins vinyl on turntables.  I tried to call and say whassup to Tejus but the line was busy.  Then he came on the air:  &ldquo;Hey I just got a phone call from ______; there&rsquo;s a Jungle Party going on at 2020 Commerce, featuring DJ <em>something</em> and DJ <em>something else</em>.  Call 713-917-4984 for details.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I said, &ldquo;whoah.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Jen said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p><em>I</em> thought it was a rave. So I described what a rave is like, basically ten times better than Numbers, so we&rsquo;re like forget Numbers, let&rsquo;s go.</p>

<p><p>We arrived, and I soon learned the fine distinction between rave and party.  (I haven&rsquo;t had much experience with either one, but I certainly noticed this distinction.)  This party was at someone&rsquo;s home.  I won&rsquo;t say house; it was one half of a warehouse space.  We walked in and the first room was bare with plywood floor and two big stacks of speakers bumping out beats.  The DJ overlooked this room through an opening that looked like a wet bar, but was too high to be that.  From this room we walked up steps and found a kitchen sink and cabinets built into the hallway, another bare room with exactly one couch and big TV with something Sega being played, and a bathroom.  There was no carpet anywhere, but only plywood nailed firmly as the floor.</p>

<p><p>Jennifer recognized it first, &ldquo;this is someone&rsquo;s <em>house</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p><em>Ahh</em> I thought.  <em>Party</em>.  I&rsquo;m quick sometimes.  Sometimes not.</p>

<p><p>After our quick tour I was like, forget Sega, I came here to dance.  Several people were standing around the edge of the dance floor entry thing, but no one was dancing.  So I danced Rob&rsquo;s Crazy Dance at a moderate level, which is still crazier than most people.  People continued to stream in, and most of them streamed toward the back to talk in the kitchen or watch Sega or whatever.  I commented to Jennifer, who was in the corner watching the whole scene, that it felt pretty odd to be the only one dancing, but oh well.</p>

<p><p>After a while, people slowly collected in the front area and a few began to dance.  This DJ was good, mixing the vinyl well.  I was dancing a higher level of Rob&rsquo;s Crazy Dance. I was excited though, to see the next DJs come in; I hoped they would pump up the beats.</p>

<p><p>The two who had arrived, indicating their DJ status by carrying a big metal case the right shape to hold a lot of vinyl, were both women.  One had dreads right out of Jamaica, the other had straight black hair that reminded me of Cleopatra or some generic Egyptian queen.  Turns out Egyptian girl was the DJ; I never heard her voice.  Jamaican girl was on mic with her English (British)-Jamaican accent encouraging us to party on the dance floor.</p>

<p><p>I didn&rsquo;t need much encouragement from her; this new DJs beats were a million times better than the previous.  Absolutely kickin&rsquo; huge heavy mongo beats with layers and layers of music and high hats tweaked beyond recognition. Incredible. I loved it. Rob&rsquo;s Crazy Dance to the max.</p>

<p><p>The dance floor became relatively packed, compared to what had been there when I started.  Only one other girl had her own crazy dance, which I watched on occasion.  Most people were just kinda wigglin&rsquo;, looking up toward the DJ window booth thing.  I mostly stayed in my own dance world, only looking up when the beats faded into just music for a brief break.  At these points I usually started bouncing with both hands in the air toward the DJ booth, &ldquo;PumpItUp!! PumpItUp!! PumpItUp!! PumpItUp!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>And the beats got even <em>better</em>.  Still the Egyptian hair DJ, with whom by then I had thoroughly fallen in love, and she was spinning some huge beats, with so much bass I could feel my legs vibrating as the bass hit, through the floor and even through the air, blowing my leg hairs around, vibrating my flesh. In<em>credible!</em></p>

<p><p>I actually reached a meditative state, where I literally didn&rsquo;t care/think about what my arms and legs were doing, where I no longer counted beats, anticipating changes.  I was truly in the flow. Rob&rsquo;s Crazy Dance Trance, or Rob&rsquo;s Crazy beyond-the-max-look-out-you-might-get-hit Dance.</p>

<p><p>Finally, I was tired.</p>

<p><p>Jennifer had been dancing some (I was glad she had moved out of the corner), and was up watching the DJ when I determined I was tired.</p>

<p><p>I caught her attention and asked what time it was.  She had no idea.  I went up the steps to say I was ready to go, and to give my new DJ love a hug for playing such incredible stuff.  I waited for her to put new vinyl on, then tapped her shoulder.  She looked up and I mouthed, &ldquo;thank you,&rdquo; and gave her a quick A-frame hug.  It was too loud for me to possibly learn her name, and she was obviously busy.  Jennifer too was ready to go so we went.</p>

<p><p>Outside, &ldquo;do you hear that ringing noise?&rdquo; I joked.  We were both astonished to find it was 1:30am.  It felt like midnight.</p>

<p><p>Jennifer said she had a good time; I had an incredible wonderful time.. a thousand times better than Numbers.</p>
