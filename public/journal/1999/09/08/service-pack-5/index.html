                        <p class=date>8 September 1999</p>

<p><p>At work, we have our webserver inhouse.  The machine, whose name is Mickey (I always think of the Toni Basil (sp) song), hasn&rsquo;t been regularly maintained because no one wanted to shut down our web server.   Mickey needed two things fixed:
<br>1) update from Service Pack 3 to Service Pack 5
<br>2) mirror the disk drive with another drive</p>

<p><p>Looking at our web traffic statistics, I saw clearly that we have small traffic after business hours, so I figured we could easily shut it down at night and make the updates.</p>

<p><p>I felt confident in my ability to install Service Pack 5, but I wasn&rsquo;t so sure about mirror disks, so I called in super smart friend John to help with that.  John brought Maggie, since her car had a flat tire and they were on their way home from work.</p>

<p><p>What I did <em>not</em> do, however, was make sure my boss was cool with me having a &ldquo;guest&rdquo; (or two) in the office after hours, much less having someone else mess with the machines. When we arrived at like 6:30, no one else was there.  Whew.  So far so good.</p>

<p><p>We shut down Mickey (&ldquo;oh Mickey, what a pity you have to get the boot&rdquo;) and a few seconds later a different machine beeped, &ldquo;hey! where&rsquo;d the webserver go??&rdquo;  This nosey machine, named Tramp, can page or send email when the webserver has a problem.</p>

<p><p>Oops!!  So I shut down Tramp&rsquo;s webserver monitor and hoped that no page had been made, nor email sent.</p>

<p><p>I called my bosses at this point to keep them from wondering what was going on (if in fact they even knew the server was down)  Boss 1 wasn&rsquo;t home (was he on his way to the office???)  Boss 2 was like, &ldquo;no problem, thanks for calling!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Few minutes later, someone dialed in to Tramp; it was Patrick, not a boss, but someone I hadn&rsquo;t called.  Hmmm.  So I sent him a message that popped up on his screen</p>

<p><p><pre><center>
HI - this is Rob; I&rsquo;m adding
Service Pack 5 to Mickey.&rdquo;</center></pre></p>

<p><p>We kept working.  And actually at this point we were just trying to figure out why Windows wouldn&rsquo;t recognize the other disk drive.  The SCSI controller could see it; the SCSI IDs were set correctly, but Windows wouldn&rsquo;t recognize it.</p>

<p><p>We gave up on that at like 8:40 and decided to install Service Pack 5.  This finished with no problem at around 9pm.</p>

<p><p>The drive still wouldn&rsquo;t come up.</p>

<p><p>So that was it.  No one came in, &ldquo;aha!  you have unauthorized guests!&rdquo;  Instead, we left for Chinese dinner at Hunan Dragon.</p>
