<p class=date>20 September 1999</p>

<p><p>So much fun!!!!!</p>

<p><p>Kristen and I went to Galveston yesterday morning - left around
10:30am.  We did a quick driving tour of the new <b>Spur 5</b>, the
new big entrance to UH!  It&rsquo;s pretty freaky to have a highway plowing
through where once was just trees and field, not to mention the site
of Frontier Fiesta some years ago (1993?) when I was so active in SPB
(Student Program Board) and helped set up stuff in the field..
amazing.</p>

<p><p>Got to Galveston, and drove west down the seawall a few miles to a
little less popular beach which she frequents.  There were only like 5
people there when we drove up, 2 of them fishing out in the water.  We
parked, walked, plopped our stuff down near some <em>old</em> car
frames buried in the sand and halfway covered in the wash of waves.</p>

<p><p>I studied the car frames as Kristen soaked up some sunrays.  After
about 20 minutes, I was able to identify a few things - the steering
wheel was still vaguely intact on one frame, and even part of the
stainless steel windshield wiper bases.  The rear bumper was still
strong, and the rear axel was there.</p>

<p><p>The other frame was a bit trickier.  Finally I noticed - <em>oh,
it&rsquo;s upside down!</em> and things became a bit easier. I could see a
wheel well, the frame of the back seat, the muffler and part of the
steering rod for the front wheels.  Quite interesting seeing the
history there. I understand why archaeologists love their work!</p>

<p><p>I showed Kristen my findings and we swam around in the water and
watched little fishies and some birds dive bombing the water for food.
I noticed what appeared to be fish under the surface, but then I
realized they were jellyfish.</p>

<p><p>Yikes!  I sure didn&rsquo;t want to be stung by them and headed away, but
Kristen was all, &ldquo;no, they&rsquo;re cabbage head jelly fish!  C&rsquo;mon!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>She was wading her way toward them and I followed some ways behind her.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t sting?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Not these, apparently, and we were actually able to scoop them out of
the water for brief inspection!  They were so&hellip;.  oogy slippery
see-through clear and smooth like little watermelons with hundreds of
&ldquo;feet&rdquo; on one end!  Yipes!!!  I was pretty icked-out giggly excited to
touch/hold them, but they kept like rolling so their feet would touch my
hands and I&rsquo;d shriek and drop it back in the water.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m not usually a pansy, but it was just so foreign to me.  Eeek!!   Too
many monster movies I&rsquo;ve been watching apparently.  Next time I will be
more brave.</p>

<p><p>We floated around in the water for a while longer until we actually started shivering as some wind had picked up. Waded back to shore and lay on towels to dry off and got a tad burned.</p>

<p><p>Kristen fell asleep for a bit while I drove us back to Houston area. Dropped her off and I went home to bed too. Wonderful fun day.</p>
