<p><p>Awesome!</p>

<p><p>For the first time in a pretty long time I went to play Ultimate
tonight. Ultimate is a great game played with a flying disc
(&ldquo;frisbee&rdquo;).  A group of people have been playing at UH every Saturday
night for several (ten ?) years. I joined them in about 1993 or so
when I was in school there, and was consistent until I graduated.  I&rsquo;d
like to become a consistent player again.</p>

<p><p>Anyway, it was great to be back in action and only took me a few throws to get my accuracy back pretty well. (It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;ve never touched a disc since I&rsquo;ve been out there, but just not each week.)  A couple of times I made some great fast break passes to work the disc down the field.  A different couple of times I had some great almost-catches, both of which resulted slight abrasions on my legs (left knee and right calf). And a couple of times I had great catches and great throws and even got a few points for our team.</p>

<p><p>Super great night, so come on out and play any Saturday night at 10:30pm at University of Houston at Entrance 5 off Wheeler Drive.</p>

<p><p><hr></p>

<p><p>Also tonight (before Ultimate), Kristen and her mom had a combined birthday party thing and I met a dude named Willy (really) who used to be a marketing agent for Tommy Boy Records!  I was all, &ldquo;House of Pain?  Cypress Hill?&rdquo;  Yup.  Wow. He&rsquo;s gotten to hang and befriend Everlast and DJ Lethal and I&rsquo;m really impressed.  (Some of you are all, &ldquo;<em>who?</em>&rdquo;)  We talked plenty and I told him I&rsquo;m a DJ at KTRU and he&rsquo;s going to give me some CDs from some unknown local bands that have a new genre of music that I think he called &ldquo;Dominion.&rdquo;  It&rsquo;s apparently a mix of hip-hop and gospel.  I&rsquo;ll see if we can get it on KTRU!</p>

<p><p>Also at the party, Todd and Wendy were describing a business lunch they attended at a fancy ass restaurant and it turned out their business partners were in the mob. (Whatever that means right?)  Well, apparently they were all talking about guns and huge money deals and drinking lots of $180/bottle wine and Todd &amp; Wendy were pretty intimidated.  It&rsquo;s a much better story they way they told it!</p>

<p><p>Tomorrow morning Kristen and I are going to the beach.</p>

<p><p>Wende is at a great spiritual weekend workshop thing, and I greatly look forward to hearing about it tomorrow afternoon!</p>
