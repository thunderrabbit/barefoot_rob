                        <p class=date>16 september 1999</p>

<p><p>Last night after work I drove to KTRU to drop off a CD I had reviewed.  It&rsquo;s a good CD; got a good review. I had one problem, though; I left the CD at home and had just brought the case.  Doh!</p>

<p><p>After that I cruised to Mad Potter to paint my plate and Jennifer was there, &ldquo;hey let&rsquo;s go for a walk.&rdquo;  We walked and she expressed a large amount of confusion and general unhappiness about some people in her life.  I listened and (hopefully) helped her make some decisions about how to handle the various situations.</p>

<p><p>Then went over to Kristen&rsquo;s to watch a movie. We talked and stuff and when her brother Matt got home, he was all, &ldquo;where&rsquo;s the dogs?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Apparently they had gotten out of the outside gate when Kristen let them outside.  We hung out outside in the street for a bit while Matt drove around the neighborhood looking for them. Two relatively big german shepherds. Found them and turns out one had hurt her foot; couldn&rsquo;t walk. We determined it was just a surface wound and not a broken bone or anything. That&rsquo;s good, but still bad in a way.</p>

<p><p>Then we started the movie and it <em><em>SUCKED</em>!!</em></p>

<p><p>I encourage everyone to not see <em>Another Day in Paradise</em>.</p>

<p><p>We didn&rsquo;t finish the movie.</p>

<p><p>I left late, went to Wende&rsquo;s to help her eat the ice cream that was slowly melting in her freezer that&rsquo;s not working very well.  Then it was even later, so I spent the night at Wende&rsquo;s house and had good breakfast and ice cream in the morning before work.</p>

<p><p>Today at work I&rsquo;ve been mostly spending the whole morning messing with a UPS (not United Parcel Service, but Uninterruptable Power Supply) that doesn&rsquo;t seem to work correctly no matter what combination of com ports, cables, or software versions I&rsquo;ve tried.</p>

<p><p>At one point, a peer of mine was talking to the rep at the UPS place and they were both frustrated and almost got grouchy at one another. Fortunately my peer got a phone call and had to leave the room.</p>

<p><p>Still no success on the UPS. So now I&rsquo;m going through the process of renewing our digital ID key thing with VeriSign, so we can have a secure web server.  So much stuff to learn!</p>
