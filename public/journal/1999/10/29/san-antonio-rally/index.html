                        <p class=note>(transcribed from my diary) [except for text in brackets]</p>

<p class=date>29-31 october 1999</p>

<p><p>5:31am Saturday 30 October 1999</p>

<p><p>Oh my god it&rsquo;s 5:21 am.  I&rsquo;m at San Antonio Rally.  After work I
was all &ldquo;Ohshit! I didn&rsquo;t get the van!&rdquo;
[it would be a very unfortunate situation to have 12 youth ready to go to San Antonio and me have to say, &ldquo;um, I forgot to pick up the van from the rental place.&rdquo;]
Called the place and they were still open until 6pm.  It was 4:45.  I
went and got it no problem.  All the arrangements had been made by
Rog, and it was beautifully easy for me.</p>

<p><p>Drove back to work to get my CDs because there&rsquo;s a CD player in the rental van!!!!!</p>

<p><p>Then to KTRU to spin Side 1 of &ldquo;The Bear That Wasn&rsquo;t&rdquo; on Jonathan
and Sabrina&rsquo;s show. I got permission from the music director to spin
one side per week!
[there are eight sides on 4 disks in this story-album] Jonathan and
Sabrina gave me phat props on the air afterward. Nice!</p>

<p>((Feb 2015: if I remember correctly, the record was a 45 rpm disk, but
the turntables didn&rsquo;t support that speed, so to make it sound natural,
I spun the record by hand at the right speed.))</p>

<p><p>Home and packed for the rally, shaved my head, shaved my faced,
fixed spelling of Mondro&rsquo;s name on my dj_shadow.html entry and then
drove to church, picked up youth and drove to San Antonio.</p>

<p><p>[We left around 8:25pm and stopped by the bus station in downtown to
pick up Nathan and Ashley. Left the city around 8:50pm. On the way
there, we stopped once for gas (had used a quarter tank) and munchies.
Mostly just listened to music all the way.]</p>

<p><p>Arrived around 12:30am and play play play (re)learning more names:
Zara, Dara, Joanna, Hillary, Patrick, Travis, JoJo, Sam, Karen, Adam,
Oliver.. [if I left someone out that means I forgot you or I for sure know your name!]</p>

<p><p>I just realize for the second time that I don&rsquo;t need a huge
DSL-enabled unix laptop to be able to write these entries! Any laptop
with floppy would be great!</p>

<p><p>Talking to Austin - funny stuff: a pogo stick with a hugenormous
spring that would let us bounce hundreds of feet into the air..</p>

<p><p>Maia came up, &ldquo;hey Rob, where&rsquo;s the other half of your brain?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What????&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Fricke.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Aw man.. Jason had to work. Doh.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p><hr></p>

<p><p>3+ am Sunday 31 Oct 1999</p>

<p><p>YAC meeting was great today.  Joined by Mark Westerburg (sp) who
had super insightful comments and suggestions - great fantastic to
have his input.</p>

<p><p>We got a pretty big lot accomplished - my portion is to help with
website - help Zara update it.</p>

<p><p>Highlights of the day [not at YAC meeting] as I remember them:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Austin and I laffing our asses off practicing our "what's up?" 'skit' thing.  Hardly a skit - a long series of choreographed "gimme five" hand slaps while we kept saying "what's up??" with increasing vigor.  You had to be there.  [We ended up not doing the skit at the talent show because it had no conclusion - nothing really funny about it unless it's spontaneous.]

<p><li>Bryn teaching an American Sign Language workshop.  She taught us stuff like: the letters of the alphabet, man, woman, boy, girl, where, what, why, who, how, my name is ____, how are you?, today, tonight, born, stars, persecute, teach, learn, together, sex, oral sex, lesbian, gay.

<p><li>Talking to Lauren's mom Andrea - and getting big kudos for being ROB that they all love so much.

<p><li>Me and Ashley paired up at worship outside in the freezing cold and having kT come up with her blanket and covered all 3 of us with it.

<p><li>YAC wrote a smoking consequences policy!  Presented it to YRUU and the new bylaws are passed!!!  Yay!! We've been working on this for so long - 3 years I guess.  "No smoking" policy is strong.  It includes 3rd offense = 6 months of no YAC sanctioned events.

<p><li>The funniest thing in the world: 

<p>[pretend you attended Bryn's American Sign Language workshop. Pretend that Ian (tall guy) has walked up with Patrick behind him and Patrick's arms are pointing forward pretending to be Ian's arms. A blanket covers Patrick and Ian's actual arms.]

<p>Austin and I were laughing so hard that our throats were hurting. oh my god this was so funny.  Patrick is signing as Ian translates as if Ian is talking and signing: "lesbian, sex, lesbian, sex, big, lesbian, sex, lesbian, sex" 

<p>[This is just so unfunny compared to the moment.  I told Austin, "this is one of those moments that cannot be captured without a video camera.."]

</ul>

<p><p>Woke up naturally this morning and just found out we gained one hour of sleep!!  yay!!</p>

<p><p><hr></p>

<p><p>11:07pm Monday 1 November 1999</p>

<p><p>On the way home kT and I laughed for 20 minutes at an exit sign for Chew Rd.  She took a picture.</p>

<p><p>Drove pretty super fast 80-90mph and got David to his drop off point on the edge of Houston actually 30 minutes early.  We did not stop until we arrived there.  I&rsquo;m thankful for no cops or tickets!</p>

<p><p>Waited until 12:30pm when his parents should have been there and left him at 12:38. I felt a bit nervous to leave him there, but I knew he would be okay. We also had to get Ashley to the bus station at 1pm.</p>

<p><p>Fast again and got her to the station a few minutes early.  She was all, &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;m impressed with your timing.&rdquo;  Me too.</p>

<p><p>Dropped off youth at church and went home to shower before Molly&rsquo;s Halloween party!</p>
