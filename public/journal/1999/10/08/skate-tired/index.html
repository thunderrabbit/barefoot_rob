                        <p class=date>8 oct 1999</p>

<p>I went skating last night but didn&rsquo;t really have the energy to do
much.  I fell once while jumping over a road hump thing.  The fall was
not bad, but was an indication that something was amiss in my skating
abilities.  I had never previously fallen while jumping a road hump!
(There are times when I don&rsquo;t make it all the way over the hump, but
that doesn&rsquo;t cause a fall.</p>

<p>On the way to downtown I kinda tripped once, jumping sideways off the
sidewalk into the street.</p>

<p>Once we got to Louisiana Street, I zipped down with traffic down past
Jones Plaza where Party On the Plaza was being held.  No problem doing
it this time, but I didn&rsquo;t have huge big crazy energy that I usually
do.</p>

<p>I rested at the plaza and then did the street thing once more.</p>

<p>This time I almost fell and it would have been really bad.  My right
skate hit a small pothole in the street (small like 3 inches across)
and I almost fell on my face.  I recovered quickly though and hopped
up onto the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Apparently it was time to go home.</p>

<p>On the way out, I saw Ryan!  He&rsquo;s one of my youth at Emerson, except
for the fact that I&rsquo;m not currently a youth advisor there.  Met his
parents and sister.</p>

<p>Near City Hall, I saw some guys painting in the street. They were
measuring and marking 10 foot square blocks for some kind of booths
for a street fest type deal.  That was pretty neat.  A couple times he
lost track of what number he was s&rsquo;posed to paint in the block, so I
reminded him, but he didn&rsquo;t thank me.</p>

<p>Got home, and I boiled some water for chicken soup tonight and forgot
about it and it all boiled away.  No harm done, fortunately.  It was
just water and I didn&rsquo;t cook the dry pot for too long.  Whew!</p>

<p>Sleep sleep sleep.</p>
