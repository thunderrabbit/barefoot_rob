<p><p>I came in to work today for the speedy internet connection, and so I could review CDs while I&rsquo;m online.  At home, I use linux to be online, but I haven&rsquo;t set it up to be able to listen to CDs.</p>

<p><p>Today I reviewed <i>pro audio</i> by neil landstrumm, and <i>a ma zone</i> by zap mama.</p>

<p><p>Neil CD was techno-esque with mostly two step (boom tik boom tik boom tik sound) and lots of layers of electronics on that.</p>

<p><p>Zap Mama features beautiful melodious female vocals with a grand variety of instruments backing them up.  The sounds ranged from jazz, to hip hop, to tribal, to funk, to reggae.  Lots of great stuff.</p>

<p><p><hr></p>

<p><p>Last night I went to a party with a friend of mine (I&rsquo;m going to keep this entirely anonymous).  A friend of my friend called the party, with an odd question/concern: had his fiance&rsquo; and a mutual friend showed up at the party?</p>

<p><p>He was at a payphone, slightly intoxicated (he had mostly sobered up after being on the phone with our party for an hour), and had been left there essentially, by his fiance&rsquo; and a friend of his and another friend, because he didn&rsquo;t want to go with them, but wanted to stay home and study.  They refused to take him home, his fiance&rsquo; refused to give him even his house keys&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know the whole story, but he was worried/angry about them, they were no where to be found, and it was just so melodramatic!</p>

<p><p>I don&rsquo;t even really have a point, but it just seemed so odd to me that people would act like that.</p>

<p><p><hr></p>

<p><p>I called Card A today and I have a balance of $5603.22 on it!  Yay!  This is good because it means the balance is being carried at 4.9%, instead of 18 or 13 percent on the other cards.  The 4.9% interest rate is good for 6 months from now, so I will have to move it again in April.</p>
