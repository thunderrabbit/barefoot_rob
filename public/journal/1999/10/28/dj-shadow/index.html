                        <p class=date>28 october 1999</p>

<p>DJ Shadow concert was phat.  I&rsquo;m not really into the Hip Hop scene,
(which I realized more after the show,) but I really thought the
turntablism was fresh.</p>

<p>(I have a guess that some of my readers might benefit from some definitions)</p>

<p>(These are my definitions; if you have a better or more precise
definition, use it!)</p>

<p>vinyl n. - twelve inch record with sounds recorded on it. Also &ldquo;wax&rdquo;</p>

<p>turntable n. - device on which vinyl is played.  has a speed adjuster
to change the pitch</p>

<p>volume n. - you know what it is.  Each turntable has one.</p>

<p>spin v. - play vinyl on turntable</p>

<p>DJ n. - individual spinning vinyl</p>

<p>wheels n. - turntables (usually two), used synchronously to allow
continuous music while DJ changes vinyl on one turntable</p>

<p>scratch v. - quickly reversing the direction of spin on vinyl for a
brief instant, or back and forth super quickly.</p>

<p>crossfader n. - analog slide switch that determines which turntable is
being amplified through the system. Left only, both equal, right only,
or any variation is possible.</p>

<p>crossfade v. - using the crossfader to adjust how audible is each turntable.</p>

<p>turntablism n. - the art of using all the above to make mad phat beats!</p>

<p>Some funny things:</p>

<p>Before the show actually started, I sat near the stage watching the
crowd slowly develop. With the lights and music blaring, I likened it
to watching a very loud flower unfold into full bloom.</p>

<p>When the DJs were spinning, I could look back over the crowd (I
retained my position by the stage) and see a sea of bobbing heads,
like a bunch of pigeons.  I was bobbing too, grooving to the
beat&hellip; but what would an extra-terrestrial think?</p>

<p>Some cool things:</p>

<p>Beat juggling.  I had heard the term before, but didn&rsquo;t know what it
meant.</p>

<p>First: two identical records on two turntables, in the same beat.
Crossfade between the turntables is inaudible; they are playing the
same music.</p>

<p>Then: crossfade to one wheel, turn the other back, crossfade to other
wheel, turn the first back, crossfade to one wheel again, turn the
other back&hellip;</p>

<p>Effect: the same beat sequence is repeated (kinda as if the record is
skipping, but without the skip sound).</p>

<p>Note: the DJ has to do this perfectly or it will certainly sound like
crap.  less than half a second to crossfade and spin the record back
to precisely the same spot.. amazing!</p>

<p>The technical skills, the knowledge of exactly what is on the records,
beat juggling, scratching..  were all quite impressive to me.</p>

<p>Mondro (another KTRU DJ) was beside me at the stage and he was all,
&ldquo;yeah that&rsquo;s called beat juggling.  It&rsquo;s how breakbeats and all that
got started.&rdquo;  or something.  Whoah!</p>

<p>In all, the show was not my thing.  Technically yes, but it just
wasn&rsquo;t my music.  Gimme the phat jungle beats anytime.  I&rsquo;m super
thankful for the chance to see it live!</p>

<hr />

<p>I didn&rsquo;t even mention Latyrx (not &ldquo;latrix&rdquo; but &ldquo;la-Teer-ix&rdquo;) two MCs
who were featured. They rapped and got the party waving our hands in
the air, making a lot of noise&hellip; and were certainly having a great
time themselves.  I yelled and waved and had big fun, but in general,
this was also not my thing.  I&rsquo;m still super thankful for the
experience!</p>
