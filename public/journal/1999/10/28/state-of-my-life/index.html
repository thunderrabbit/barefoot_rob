<p><p><b>STATE OF MY LIFE</b></p>

<p><p><ol></p>

<p><p><li>I have reviewed 48 CDs for KTRU, many of them this semester!  I like being able to listen and shout in my mind, &ldquo;I reviewed that!!&rdquo;    &ldquo;Review&rdquo; in this context means listen to the CD to see if it&rsquo;s broadcastable by KTRU standards. We rate the songs on a 5 point scale basically and DJs know what&rsquo;s good on the CD before they&rsquo;ve ever heard it or even heard of it. I usually randomly grab CDs I&rsquo;ve never heard and play them when I&rsquo;m there.</li></p>

<p><p><li>A couple nights ago while talking to my dad he was all, &ldquo;if you choose to attend USM, I&rsquo;ll help pay for tuition.  There is a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> tuition scholarship available for first year students, so you could have your first year tuition paid.   &hellip;.  if you drop out, you&rsquo;ll owe me the money back.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Wow.</p>

<p><p>USM is Univeristy of Santa Monica, where he received his masters in Spiritual Psycology with and emphasis in consciousness, health and healing. I have felt myself pulled in that direction-ish.</li></p>

<p><p><li>I was dating someone until&hellip; Monday night I guess.  Now we are broken up.  It didn&rsquo;t happen in one swoop; she was distant over the weekend, I called her on it, and she said &ldquo;I have
been feeling weird about us lately, like I&rsquo;m not getting what I need from our relationship.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I was basically, &ldquo;okay,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you told me.&rdquo;  When I said, &ldquo;maybe we should just be friends,&rdquo; she said &ldquo;okay&rdquo; as soon as I uttered &ldquo;friends.&rdquo;  Fair enough.</p>

<p><p>Oddly, I felt a sort of positive surge of energy, like I had been pushing my energy toward her to try to draw her to me maybe.  When I recognized it was over, my energy came back and I felt better. Hmm. Nice.</li></p>

<p><p><li>In a subsequent conversation with a friend of mine, I described the afforementioned events and five years of my relationship history. The question came back to me, &ldquo;let me get this straight: you&rsquo;ve been in &lsquo;relationship&rsquo; with someone for essentially all of your adult life?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>That hit me pretty well. &ldquo;Um, yes.&rdquo; How pathetic of me.  For how long have I been saying, &ldquo;I need to just <em>not</em> date anyone for a while.&rdquo; ??  How long does the while last?  A month at most.  Okay, maybe 3.  Not a year.  Maybe I should try a one month at a time committment to myself. That feels right.</li></p>

<p><p><li>I have ordered a new domain. Am I too computer nerdy for my own good?  This will be 3 (technically 4) domains that I own. It should be working in a day or so.  I should have it full of data within a couple weeks.  or more.
</li></p>

<p><p><li>On Tuesday night, I went to KTRU to talk with Dennis (DL on the airwaves) who hosts the Hip Hop show every Tuesday night.</p>

<p><p>Oh oh oh oh and!!!  AND!!!!  I got a ticket to DJ Shadow!  The Music Directors or the Promotions Director or somehow the right people knew that I wanted a ticket and I got a message all, &ldquo;Rob, there is an extra Zap Mama CD; it&rsquo;s in my box if you want it&rdquo; from Michael, one of the music directors. (I reviewed and enjoyed our first copy of it.) I was all, Thanks!!! and went to get the CD this morning and BANG there&rsquo;s a DJ Shadow ticket in my CD case!!!  Too too cool.</li></p>

<p><p><li>I finished my plate that I&rsquo;ve been painting at <a href="https://www.themadpotter.com">The Mad Potter</a>! It&rsquo;s a paint-your-own pottery studio on my street. They provide white pottery and paint. Customers provide creativity and a few dollars and get to take home dishwasher safe, totally useable dish!</p>

<p><p>I had been working on this plate since 16 August. I estimate I put about 37 hours into it.  It&rsquo;s pretty detailed, - not an image <em>per se</em> but swirly twisty weaving ribbons of lines and dots.</p>

<p><p>I also did a plate that sports the logo for FSD Data Services on it. I like my job, and wanted my own FSD plate.</li></p>

<p><p><li>Tonight is DJ Shadow concert at Numbers!  1.25 hours until doors open.</li></p>

<p><p><li>Tomorrow (Friday) begins San Antonio Rally, to which I&rsquo;ll be driving a vanload of youth for 35+ hours of talking, play, music, zany antics, and just about any fun (legal) thing one can think of.</li>
