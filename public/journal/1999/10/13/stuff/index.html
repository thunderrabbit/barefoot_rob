<p><p>nice.  My Card A balance is 0 dollars.  Soon as I finish this entry, I&rsquo;ll have them pay Card D (or was it C?)</p>

<p><p>Until yesterday I have had just one computer (PII 350Mhz) running with 2 hard disks in it - a 1 gig and 8 gig, with 300 megs given to Windows 95 and the rest to linux.  I&rsquo;ve been using linux to access the internet and everything.</p>

<p><p>I had 2 disks sitting on my desk and a shell of my old linux machine (PII 233Mhz) with no hard disks in it.  I began the process of installing those disks in the machine.  One of the disks was reporting bad media or faulty track 0, and could not be used.  Doh!  That was a 2.5 gig.  The other (1 gig) formatted okay, and I got Win 95 installed on it, but it seems to have some surface errors that I&rsquo;m having scandisk fix now.  It&rsquo;s taken all night because it keeps restarting (even though I&rsquo;m running in safe mode with no other drivers up; MS is such crap).</p>

<p><p>Yesterday at KTRU, I was thrilled to see 2 or 3 more of the CDs I reviewed recently are in playlist!  Yay!  Mostly thrilled to see Momus <em>Stars Forever</em>; I really enjoyed that one.  I waited until I got some callers (so I knew people were listening. (I had announced as soon as I got on the air, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re listening, call me and I&rsquo;ll give you free bumper stickers!&rdquo; and no one called.  (Maybe free bumper stickers are not enough to get a call.))) and then played one of my favorite tracks.  I don&rsquo;t remember the name of it, but it&rsquo;s a hard rap in first person about how shy the rapper is.  Very funny.</p>

<p><p>Also at KTRU, I got to give away passes to <a href="https://www.theminusman.com">The Minus Man</a>.  I had helped myself to a pass (we had a stack; I assume it was okay.) and Kristen and I went last night.  The movie was Okay, but not thrilling or even quite captivating, but more odd. It was basically about some guy who was a bit mentally unstable and seemed very nice, but gently killed people.  At least Janeane Garafulo (sp) was cute.</p>

<p><p>Right now I&rsquo;m going to update my credit card stuff on my front page and go to work.  See ya!</p>
