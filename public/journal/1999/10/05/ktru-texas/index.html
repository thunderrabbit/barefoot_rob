                        <p class=date>5 October 1999</p>

<p>This morning before KTRU, I purchased a cassette tape to record
my show for Zara, who requested a Rob Mix tape.  When she asked
me for such a tape, I was all, &ldquo;when will I ever have time to
make a mix tape???&rdquo;  Oh yeah..  I can just record my show at
KTRU!  So that is what I did.</p>

<p>However, at KTRU I was not able to get the station turned on.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s off when I get there in the mornings this semester, but a
quick phone call with the secret code will turn it on. Not this
time.  So I paged the station General Manager, and called the
Station Manager.  Station Manager suggested something to try.
General Manager called me back and suggested a solution, but
after I tried the first suggestion, the station came on.   Yay!</p>

<p>Good thing I was recording the whole event, and entertainingly, I
recorded my end of the last two phone conversations at the
beginning of the tape!  Great!!!</p>

<p>We had a whole stack of passes for two to Happy Texas, a movie
about some escaped convicts posing as beauty pageant experts.</p>

<p>I announced them on the air and I gave away two and grabbed a
pass for myself.  Amanda and I went to see it and thought the
movie was pretty funny!   I even cried at the very end, although
I believe the scene was not designed to be tear jerking. Oh well.</p>

<hr />

<p>Also today, I reviewed a 2 CD set by Momus, called Stars Forever,
which I really enjoyed!!  I turned in milk bottles at the grocery
store to get the deposits back (dollar each for seven bottles)
and then purchased printer ink cartridge for my printer so I
could print the CD review.</p>

<p>Turned in the CD and said HI to the DJs there and asked Holly if
she knew of a PJ Harvey song that had chorus, &ldquo;is that all there
is?&rdquo;  because the owner of Mission Burritos asked and I think
she&rsquo;ll give me free burrito coupons to give away at the station
if we can find the song for her.</p>

<p>Outside the station were 200 or so CDs being tossed, so I went
through the entire stack and pulled out about 4 for myself and
about 12 for presents for friends.  Nice!  Come by the station if
you want some CDs!</p>

<p>Then to Record Rack, where I said HI to Bruce and tried to sell
him 7 unopened CDs from the KTRU stack, but he said he couldn&rsquo;t
sell them.  Oh well, but oh yes he had NIN new album the fragile
(halo 14) which I bought after some internal debate.  Finally I
decided it was NIN; I had to have it.</p>

<p>Then home and listened to the album, while waiting for Amanda to
arrive so we could go see Happy Texas and we saw it and she went
home and here I am.</p>
