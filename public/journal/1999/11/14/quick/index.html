                        <p>01:54 Sunday 14 November 1999</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m so tired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Today&rdquo; I went to George R Brown Convention Center for a planning
meeting for the Techno Cosmic Mass that will happen on 9 December
1999.  The TCM will be super awesome and you should all attend!  It&rsquo;s
free!  <a
href="https://www.heartstormproductions.com">www.heartstormproductions.com</a>
is the URL for the event I think.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s free for all!</p>

<p>Based on a rave type atmosphere, it will be a straight-edge (that
means &ldquo;no drugs&rdquo; (for us straight-edge types)) combination of imagery,
live and recorded sound, music, singing, rapping, spiritual stuff, big
giant altars to the four directions/elements, just just just amazing!</p>

<p>Come join us on the 9th!  Or, if you want to help set up the thing,
<a href="mailto:thunderrabbitATcheerfulDOTcom">email me</a>!</p>

<hr />

<p>There were about 20 people at the planning meeting, including a cute
girl named Madeline.  I notice her as soon as she walked into the
room.  Turns out we kinda noticed each other, but didn&rsquo;t really talk
until after the planning thing.  We are working on the team that will
build the altars for the four directions.  I&rsquo;m in charge of the water
altar; she&rsquo;s in charge of the earth altar, and actually she is the
head leader type person for all the altars.</p>

<p>She asked if anyone could give her a ride home and I volunteered.</p>

<p>We spent pretty much the whole day together (noon to 10:30pm).  Went
to High Fashion Fabrics and talked and asked questions and laughed
lots about all variety of things.  We discovered we both love Tori
Amos.  We spent a pretty long time there until I was getting quite
hungry.  (Madeline is apparently a fabric junkie).</p>

<p>We took flyers for the Techno Cosmic Mass to Soundwaves, Chemistry
Records, Record Rack, and Cactus Records.  Oh, and one more place but
I don&rsquo;t remember the name.</p>

<p>To Mission Burritos where we ate a burrito each and laughed more and
more.  Acorns fell on our table a few times; we shared inside jokes;
we just had a blast talking.</p>

<p>To Amy&rsquo;s Ice Cream, where we saw Heather from KTRU and told her about
the upcoming event.  Ate ice cream and I stories about YRUU and sign
language; lots of laughing and fun.</p>

<p>Then to Madeline&rsquo;s house, where she read about my birth numbers: <sup>27</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub>
and we found that under the surface (into our inner workings and
&ldquo;issues&rdquo;) we are actually amazingly similar.  We have similar
relationship patterns, similar driving forces, just similar stuff.</p>

<p>To her room, where we listened to Tori Amos (and PJ Harvey for a bit)
and talk talk talked.  There was a bit of sexual tension present, but
we were both wise enough to know it would hugely damage our innocent
relationship.</p>

<p>Talk talk talk until 10:32pm when I left for Ultimate frisbee at UH.</p>

<hr />

<p>Chased the frisbee and Justin around the field (that sounds bad) and
had a great time.  (When Justin and I are on opposite teams, we like
to cover each other.  We are both better at offense than defense when
one of us covers the other.)</p>

<p>Played 3 games between like 11pm and 12:40am.  Drove home, called
Madeline at 1am.  Number is disconnected.  Redialed.  Same thing.
Redialed.  Same thing.  DOH!!!!</p>

<p>Dug through the phone book, racking my brain for her last name.  T
something.  Ugh.  This sucks.  20 minutes of scanning through all the
last names that start with T in order to find one that kinda looked
familiar.  Nothing.</p>

<p>Took a shower.  Wrote this entry.</p>

<p>02:16am now.   Good night.</p>
