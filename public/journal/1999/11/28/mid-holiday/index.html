                        <p class=date>11:10am Sunday 28 November 1999</p>
<p class=note>(transcribed from my diary)</p>

<p>Friday I wasted time at the computer pretty much all day until 5-7pm
when I DJed at KTRU, covering for Jonathan and Sabrina.  After the show,
drove to Marcel and Kayse&rsquo;s for Thanksgiving Party.  Wende was
there and I drove her back with me to KTRU from 11pm to 1am covering for
Tejus MK Ultra show.</p>

<p>After MK Ultra, I dropped Wende off at my apartment and I
went back out to Montrose Radio <a
href="http:www.firstamendmentradio.org">www.firstamendmentradio.org</a>
which is rebroadcast illegally in Houston on 94.9fm with a 35 watt
transmitter.</p>

<p>Saturday Wende and I got up and wrote To Do lists and I cleared my table
(big success on my part) and then we put some shelves up in her apt.
Then to Molly and Will&rsquo;s (where Maggie and John are living while their
house is being built) and watched Clerks.  (I give it a 50% rating) Then
rode with Will and John to play Ultimate at UH (every Saturday night).</p>

<p>Played three games (won 1) and then Wende arrived just before we started
game 4, which my team barely won!  Sweet victory; I was so tired.  Wende
drove us to her apartment where we spent the night and where I am now
while she&rsquo;s at church.</p>

<p>Clerks had a positive affect on (effect in) my life:  I am now more
committed to Wende, who would bring me lasagna to work (or steamed
broccoli).  I have been pestering Wende so crazy much for sex.  I
suddenly realized last night how self-centered my life is.  Also, I want
to make
my apartment more livable and hospitable for myself and others.  Right
now (and for the past 8 years (not including when girlfriends lived with
me) since Tammy moved out) it has been a dumpy bachelor pad.  I&rsquo;m kinda
shifting toward keeping it fixed up and cleaned up.  Is this a new era
in my life?</p>

<p>.

<p>Last night while talking with Wende I expressed how I felt self centered
and too pestery for sex and that I wanted that to change in my life.
The dialogue was great; I want to continue it as far as we can.</p>

<p>We went to Family Planning clinic for HIV tests on Tuesday, but the
tester was on vacation so we made appointments for this coming Tuesday
at 4 and 4:30pm.  The test will be free (next week only; it&rsquo;s usually
$5) and results in 2 weeks.</p>

<p>Tossing around in bed this morning, I greatly encouraged Wende to get up
and go to church.  She did and now just called me to thank me for
getting her up.  It&rsquo;s 12:12 now and we&rsquo;re about to munch lunch.</p>
