<p><p>Wow!!</p>

<p><p>Today work was cool; a guy named Rey installed the circuit for our
SDSL connection.  That is just the &lsquo;local loop&rsquo; which connects to our
demarc, but not all the way to our router.  In other words, we are
closer to having DSL, but not yet.</p>

<p><p>I read/skimmed through the 258 page PDF file on the Netopia R7100
router which should be arriving soon via UPS.</p>

<p><p>Went to the KTRU weekly DJ meeting; station manager Meg was not
there, so Dennis filled in for her.  I must say the meeting was a lot
quicker!</p>

<p><p>Also helped Kevin with some javascript stuff.  He was coding some SAS
modules to output Javascript code for our website.  I had written the
javascript for my offline HTML application; I showed him how to
translate it to have his SAS module write it.</p>

<p><p>That was the boring part of my day.</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>After work, I drove down to Ares Robotics, where we are building all
of the altars for Techno Cosmic Mass tomorrow.  Talked to Richard who
was a bit frazzled; he wanted to have been this far completed last week,
but we are doing the best we can with the time we were given.</p>

<p><p>My water table had a layer of plastic over it and a pool at one end
so the pump could sit in it and push water to the top for the sprayers.</p>

<p><p>We didn&rsquo;t have sprayers, though.  Richard went with me to Home
Depot.  I had a great time, and I swear he was like a little kid in a
candy store.  Really.  In mis mind he had a vision of what he wanted to
build, but didn&rsquo;t really know exactly how he wanted to do it.  I
recognized his technique as he summed it up later, &ldquo;I just walk around
until I find the perfect thing to do the job.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>We bought the following:</p>

<p><p>12 foot garden hose, garden hose to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; adapter, four <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> X 12&rdquo;
pipes, four <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; T fittings, one 90 degree fitting, six <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; close
connectors, and five shower heads.</p>

<p><p>ascii picture time:</p>

   SSaaT=====T=====T=====T=====9

 S = garden hose  
 a = adapter
 T = T fitting
 = = 1/2" pipe
 9 = 89 degree fitting
 ^ = shower head
     close connectors are between S and a and connecting all the ^
</pre>

<p><p>We also grabbed some blue pastic tarp and a blue shower curtain and
some blue paint and some teflon tape and some lights.  Back at the shop
tonight we connected all the plumbing and layed out a design for the
plastic tarp (as a skirt around the table) and the lights.  The mountain
fountain that Wende and I made will cover the pump.  It will be
fantastic; I am ecstatic!!</p>

<p><p>Madeline&rsquo;s Earth Altar is not as far along; Richard asked if I can be
in charge of helping her get it finished tomorrow.  No problem.  Hers
will be relatively simple; no moving parts or flowing water or anything.</p>

<p><p>When I got home, there was a message from the mom of a friend of
mine, telling me about the TCM and that I might want to go!!  Yay!  The
word is out there!</p>

<p><p>I am to be back at Ares at 7:30am.  It&rsquo;s 11:30pm now.  Good night!!</p>

<p><p>With Love
<br>- Rob</p>
