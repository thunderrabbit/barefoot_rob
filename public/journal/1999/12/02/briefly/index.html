<p>Wow.  so close to 2000!!!!!!!</p>

<p>Tonight Wende and I went to Molly and Will&rsquo;s house (where Maggie
and John are living while their house is being built).  The boys
were gone, so after munching some yummy lasagna, we put lights
and decorations up on the tree and watched Mall Rats.  We had
just previously watched Clerks, with which I was not very
impressed, but they promised me I would like Mall Rats better.<br />
My official vote is that Mall Rats is better than clerks, but
mostly just at the end.  The first half was not that great.</p>

<p>I told Maggie I want to learn to dance like Jay (of Jay and Silent Bob)</p>

<hr />

<p>&ldquo;Today&rdquo; (Wednesday) I turned in my 50th CD reviewed at KTRU!<br />
It was for a band called S.O.L.O. and the CD is <em>Out is In</em>.
  I certainly enjoyed it; I found it smooth and jazzy with a
little hint of turntablism and electronica.  Nice album.</p>

<p>I think I might put my KTRU reviews on here.  I&rsquo;ve got most
of them saved on disk.</p>

<hr />

<p>Speakin&rsquo; of KTRU, at KTRU on Thursday (Thanksgiving), I subbed
for someone from 3-5pm.  I got a call from a woman named Donna,
who used to work college radio at A&amp;M back when she was a
student there!  She called just to say, &ldquo;someone is listening&rdquo;
and that she used to work Thanksgiving back in the day.</p>

<p>Turns out she is a local professional DJ!  Cool!  We have
exchanged a couple of emails, but nothing astonishing.  I did
enjoy having <em>someone</em> call just to say my Turkey Day efforts
were being heard!</p>

<hr />

<p>What else?&hellip;  Oh!  Wende is working at The Container Store, and
she had some shelves (elfa) handed down to her, and she has
handed them down to me!  Now I have some nice white shelves on my
living room wall.. So far I have only placed my high school and
college yearbooks on there, plus Volumes 1 - 9 of my written diaries.</p>

<hr />

<p>At work I got a raise!!  Yay!  Now I&rsquo;m making $18.70 per hour.
Very sweet.  Debt, I&rsquo;m coming to kick your ass!!   Today I wrote
some JavaScript (actually I just cleaned up my boss&rsquo; code) that
he will use on some projects.  I wrote the original code; he messed
with it and couldn&rsquo;t quite get it to do all he wanted; I cleaned it
up and got it all straight.</p>

<p>I also wrote some code that will check some forms for completeness
before allowing the user to submit the information to us.  This is
made more interesting because we actually are using SAS to read a
database and write the HTML/Javascript to create the form/check the
form.  Fun stuff.</p>

<p>Oh, and our new DSL line is almost here.  The circuit should be
installed by December 7th, and we should be live a few days after.
I&rsquo;m pretty excited to have this new experience - I will be switching
all the IP addresses in our NT network, plus in our Free BSD unix box
and teaching the router how to filter packets as a firewall, and
all kinds of stuff.</p>

<p>Once this is stable, we&rsquo;ll be beefing up our web server to actually
be two separate machines - one for processing requests, and the other
just as a file server.  Soon thereafter we will bump that up to
two parallel web servers and the 1 file server using a RAID Array.</p>

<ul>
<li>- - techno babble complete - - -</li>
</ul>

<p>Oh, and soon as I get my website happy on my new ISP, I&rsquo;ll begin
diverting traffic over here.</p>
