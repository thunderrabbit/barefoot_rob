<p><p>The mountain is pretty much complete.  Well, except for the painting it part.  It basically looks like a big pile of shaving cream.  I love it!  I have had such big great fun building this thing, and testing it&hellip;  I think I will build a fountain to install permanently in my living room somewhere.  Some kinda fountain with a long and winding path for the water to traverse.</p>

<p><p>Today we spent pretty much all day on this project, though a lot of time was required to simply let the Great Stuff harden for 2 hours after each application.  I worked on <a href="indigoangel.cjb.net">Indigo Angel</a> website during one 2-hour span, and in the next 2 hour span, Wende and I went to Indigo Angel where we grabbed some quartz crystals to decorate the mountain in some manner, and then zipped back home just in time to watch Simpsons and Futurama.</p>

<p><p>From Indigo Angel, to Wende&rsquo;s house where she fed her cats and we peed.  Then she was all, &ldquo;okay, let&rsquo;s grab a bite to eat at Taco Bell, then zip over to your house for The Simpsons.&rdquo;  It was 6:43; that left 17 minutes.  &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Zipped to Taco Bell; I dropped her off and turned the car around to wait for her.  Soon as she came out, I pulled out of the spot, she hopped in saying, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not going to believe this,&rdquo; and we sped away.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What, you forgot my taco?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Nope.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You got Root Beer instead of Dr. Pepper?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Nope.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;They were out of cheese.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Heh.  That&rsquo;s funny.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>She wasn&rsquo;t kidding, but it is still funny.</p>

<p><p>Zippy zipped home and ran upstairs.  Turned the TV on.  30 seconds later the chorus of voices called, &ldquo;Ahhhhhh  The Simpsons&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I greatly enjoyed the episode.</p>

<p><p>Futurama was pretty funny too.</p>

<p><p><hr align="left" width="25%"></p>

<p><p>By then the mountain was ready for a test run.  Took it outside to the parking lot, tossed an extension cord out the window to run the pump, filled a bucket with water for the pump to use, plugged it all in, and watched it run, checking to see if the water would drain down the mountain the way I wanted.   Mostly it didn&rsquo;t, but simply poured down into holes between the lumps of hardened foam.  I marked the spots with a pen so I could fill them and try again.</p>

<p><p>Filled the spots and I think it&rsquo;s pretty much ready to go.  I&rsquo;m in the latter half of a 2 hour hardening phase.</p>

<p><p>Work tomorrow and then on Tuesday we will all meet and hopefully get all this stuff finished up.</p>

<p><p>With Love
<br>- Rob</p>
