                        <p class=date>Saturday 14 August 1999</p>

<p><p>After having been up until 3am last night, I was sleeping soundly at 8am when Jason called.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up honky?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yo Jason, what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You wanna go water skiing with us today?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What? Water skiing? Um, yeah what time?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You gotta be at my house by 9 o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Um, okay, it&rsquo;s what 7am now?&rdquo;  I had thought my clock said 7.  It felt like 7.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s 8.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;uh oh. okay bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Got to his house at 8:59am.</p>

<p><p>His friends Chris and Tammy were there, and his sister Tana. We piled into my car and Tammy&rsquo;s car and stopped by Albertson&rsquo;s for ice, water, and sunscreen.</p>

<p><p>Sara works at Albertson&rsquo;s and she surprised me with a surprised, &ldquo;hi Rob!&rdquo; as I walked by.  Wow!  No time to talk now, but I gave her a hug and we zipped off to the boat rental place.</p>

<p><p>Jason&rsquo;s mom was there and we got the boat and all that.</p>

<p><p>Skiing was awesome.  I haven&rsquo;t been in at least 10 years.  I think the last time I went was at SWUUSI, when I ended up with 4 stitches below my eye when a ski popped me in the face as I fell.  I&rsquo;ve been snow skiing since then, and there&rsquo;s a nagging feeling that I&rsquo;ve been water skiing since then, but I can&rsquo;t remember when so I say I haven&rsquo;t been.   In either case, it&rsquo;s been a long time.</p>

<p><p>Jason went first; it was his birthday (the reason we were skiing at all) and he slalomed.  He got up on the first try and skied for a pretty long time, although he didn&rsquo;t do many tricks or anything.</p>

<p><p>Chris went next and got up on the first time using both skis.</p>

<p><p>When I went, I tried one ski several times, but couldn&rsquo;t ever get up out of the water!  Doh!  So I put on both skis and had no problem.  I loved zipping way outside the boat on turns, skimming across the water at super ultra jet speed.  I tried a couple of tricks: letting my butt touch the water, picking up one ski, jumping over the wake (actually the boat we used wasn&rsquo;t that big so the wake was not much to jump), oh, and I straddled a little styrofoam bouy thing along the edge of the lake.</p>

<p><p>That reminds me- the lake water was gross.  Not super deep, and stinky silty mud at the bottom that our feet just glooped right through while walking.  I used the skis as &ldquo;snow shoes&rdquo; or silt shoes in this case when I fell and was waiting for the boat to get back to me.</p>

<p><p>That also reminds me.  Each time I fell, if I was really going to wipe out well, I would cover my face and head with my arms to protect from any torpedo-like skis that might otherwise send me to the ER.  I never once got hit by a ski though, so I remained unscathed.  One time when I fell, I didn&rsquo;t really fall at first; I was about to eat-it, so I let go of the rope and just slowed to a halt and kinda tumped into the water.  Very smooth fall.</p>

<p><p>A different time I fell in the middle of a super way outside the boat turn thing and couldn&rsquo;t handle the oncoming waves as hard as I was pulling out, plus my arms and legs were so fatigued from skiing!  That was about the wildest crash I had, kinda twisted into the water and covered my head for protection.</p>

<p><p>The second time out of the boat, I tried one ski again.  With much encouragement from all aboard the boat, I was finally able to do it!!  It just required encouragement and a fine control of how steep to angle the ski out of the water to get me onto it.  Once I was up on one ski, it was relatively easy, especially with all the cheers from the boat for my success!  I barely jumped the little wake and swung outside the boat when I could.  Great great fun.</p>

<p><p>Tana, Tammy and Jason&rsquo;s mom all chose not to ski, though they all did get into the water once to cool off, amidst lots of &ldquo;gross!!! it&rsquo;s so gross!&rdquo; cries from Tana and Tammy.  The sun was baking hot on all of us and we drank lots of water.  I had one SPF 30 sunscreen and still got a little burned on my shoulders.</p>

<p><p>Mom treated us all to lunch at Mannie&rsquo;s and it was great!  I had chicen, spinach, cheese quesedillas.  Even had some leftover for breakfast.</p>

<p><p><hr align="left" width="20%"></p>

<p><p>We all parted ways and I swung by Albertson&rsquo;s to see if Sara was still there.  She was but had just finished lunch so couldn&rsquo;t talk super long.  She invited me to watch her get a tattoo tonight.  Sounded cool to me so we set up a general time and I went home.</p>

<p><p>I slept.</p>

<p><p>Sara came over, we went to the tattoo place and she spent several minutes deciding what to get.  She had had a firm decision made that morning, but wasn&rsquo;t so determined this evening.  She decided upon a yin yang symbol with fire burning up from it and the initials AH for American Humanics, an organization she volunteers and works for at University of Houston.</p>

<p><p>She dropped me off back at home and here I am.  I&rsquo;m going to bed.</p>
