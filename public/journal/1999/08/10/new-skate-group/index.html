                        <p class=date>10 August 1999</p>

<p><p>Last night I went skating with a group called Inline Swine.  Far as I can tell, they don&rsquo;t associate themselves with the name so much as associating themselves with, &ldquo;we meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8pm at Texas Art Supply.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I found the group while skating alone downtown 3 weeks ago.  They were about a block away so I caught up with them. I discovered they were cool and they skate regularly so I may hook up with this group regularly!</p>

<p><p>Last night (back to the story) we skated about mmmm 12 miles?  Through lots of places I wouldn&rsquo;t go normally, simply because I didn&rsquo;t know they existed, or wouldn&rsquo;t feel safe by myself.  (mom, please note this example of common sense)</p>

<p><p>Skate skate skated from montrose and Fairview, down to Waugh, west along Memorial, then north through some back-ass streets until we crossed over I-10. As we were crossing this narrow bridge (it did have walls and a fence-cage over it, I waved and waved at the traffic!!  &ldquo;Hey!  Flash your lights!!!!&rdquo; for about 2 minutes and not a single car flashed its lights.  Not that they could hear me, but c&rsquo;mon some kind of acknowledgement is in order&hellip;  maybe a light tap on the horn or wave a hand out the window&hellip; something! Not this time.</p>

<p><p>On and on east across TC Jester and then stopped at Durham and 11th street in the Heights for drinks at a convenience store.  I was glad to stop.  I hadn&rsquo;t really skate-exerted myself that much in quite a while, plus I started out the night with kinda ripped up wheels on my right skate.  The back center wheel (inline skates) was shredded to the point of being useless.  Kinda like when a truck tire on the highway shreds, long strips of rubber peel off, I peeled off about 1 &amp; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> pi worth of tread from my wheel hub.  (That&rsquo;s 270 degrees worth. (That&rsquo;s 75%.  (That is, my wheel was useless for skating.)))</p>

<p><p>Scott said it looked to him like my front wheel on the same skate was going to shred next.  Scott and Jeff and someone else offered me some hand-me-down wheels once we got back.  I absolutely accepted.  (If I could make it back.)</p>

<p><p>Through more back streets east of Shepherd as we headed back toward downtown, my remaining wheels seemed to work fine.  Back over I-10 on some street I waved at cars, and again got no response.  Hmpf.</p>

<p><p>Then we did more and more and more skating in a generally going-back type of manner.  Crossed over Memorial on Sawyer, which is kinda cool because Sawyer forms a nice hill over Memorial, allowing for a quick zip down the hill after skating up.</p>

<p><p>Got back to Texas Art Supply and was offered some wheels by Scott.  I thanked him profusely and said bye to all my new friends and skated home.  Put on the new wheels and I&rsquo;m excited about trying them out on Thursday!!</p>
