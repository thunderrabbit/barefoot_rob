<p class=note>(transcribed from my diary)</p>

<p>Today I felt pretty unproductive.  I wrote the following in my diary during Project Heart:

<blockquote>
<p>I'm having a crappy day because I didn't go outside even one single time and just sat in front of the
computer and <b>did some email</b> and <b>scanned Houston Rally pictures</b> but didn't really get important
stuff done. I <b>did my budget a bit</b> and <b>updated MR Labs</b> website a bit but it doesn't work. I <b>got $72 from
Flashnet</b> in the mail, but I didn't deposit it. I <b>cleaned out my bag</b> from the weekend, but didn't find
my Project Heart book. I only did piddly stuff.

<p>I'm only focusing on the negative and can't see the good in what I've done.

<p><pre>Every step forward is a step forward</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The first portion above is what I wrote at first and the second to last line is my analysis, and the last line is my
positive statement to help me reverse my negative thinking.

<p>The items <b>in bold</b> are the positives that I highlighted in my diary to encourage myself to focus on them.

<p>During the class I was offered the excellent idea that maybe I felt unproductive even while I put together <b>Recycling Day</b>,
an accomplishment in my life that exemplifies great work that feels productive now that I look back on it. I'm going to go
back through my diaries to that point in my life and see if I felt unproductive then. If I felt unproductive then, but look back on 
it now and believe I was productive, that will encourage me to change my thinking about the now.

<p><hr width="40%">

<p class=date>3:24am Tuesday 9 February 1999</p>

<p><p>After class, I got a message from Brandie, who I met in Atlanta at the Flashnet meeting.  She is currently in town and
invited me to come say HI to her at her hotel.  I called Manda to invite her, or to see if we could do something else, but got
her voice mail, so I went to see Brandie.</p>

<p><p>I showed her a bunch of rally pictures and she talked a lot about her travels to Africa and Oregon and Germany,
and I was totally enthralled.  &ldquo;Brandie, I am so inspired by you and your adventures!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>She was all, &ldquo;you just gotta go do it!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>So very true. I just gotta go do it and believe (trust and believe) the youth will be okay without me for a week or a month or
however long it is, and believe I can make the money to afford to go and just <b>GO!</b></p>

<p><p>Being inspired, though it was midnight, I was all, &ldquo;wanna go see some cool stuff in Houston?&rdquo; and <em>zip</em> we were out
the door and on the road.</p>

<p><p>I drove us to Hermann Park and we checked out the big granite ball at the Museum of Natural Science. It weighs five thousand
pounds and is &ldquo;floating&rdquo; on a layer of water so people can spin it with relative ease. Amazing and I totally love it!  We got it
spinning super fast - fast enough to make the water splash out of the bottom, which is always a fun challenge I like to accept when
I go play with this globe late at night.</p>

<p><p>On a side note, driving on the grass between the trees through the park looking for vagrants or something was a cop car across
the street from us. He drove around shining his lights and stuff and then drove away.</p>

<p><p>We walked over to another fountain, the one near the large sundial.  Brandie kicked off her shoes (one entertainingly
fell into the water which she quickly retrieved, &ldquo;thank goodness for Pay Less!&rdquo;) and we both stepped into the water. We splashed
around a tiny bit and soon the cop car drove by, then slowed, then turned around and stopped near us.</p>

<p><p>I walked over and was all, &ldquo;HI&rdquo; and he was super nice and explained that the park was closed.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been looking for you for 15 minutes!&rdquo;
he then exclaimed.  &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you see me driving around in the grass?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, but I figured you were looking for vagrants or something!  I was just showing my friend the park; she&rsquo;s from Atlanta.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>He explained the park closes at 11pm except if the planetarium has a laser light show after that time, or if there is a show at
Miller Outdoor Theater.</p>

<p><p>Fair enough, so we left.  He waited until we got to the car and began to drive away before he left.  I thought it would be funny
in a not so funny way to turn back around after he drove off.  Not funny enough to actually do it, but yeah.</p>

<p><p>To my house we went and Brandie looked through about 20 rolls of film that I&rsquo;ve taken in the last couple years, mostly from rallies
and Costa Rica trip. (Yes I still intend to finish writing about that trip!)  At like 2:30am, I drove her back to the hotel and dropped
her off.</p>

<p><p><img src="/journal/images/1999/susan_b_receipt.jpg" align="left">
Back to my house I went and stopped by the Post Office to see just how many pennies I could convert to Susan B Anthony dollars.
Went in and there was a sticker sign thing over the coin accepting slot, &ldquo;sorry for the inconvenience, we are working on the problem.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Hmmm.</p>

<p><p>I pulled the sticker off enough to put a penny in.  It worked.  I dropped in a nickel.  It worked.  I dropped in two hundred twenty one
more pennies, and they all went in fine.  I inserted a five dollar bill for a grand total of $7.27.  Hmmm, need six more cents.  I went to the car
(leaving the $7+ credit on the machine) and found a dime. That&rsquo;ll work.</p>

<p><p>Put in the dime, punched the buttons to order a single 33 cent stamp, four pennies, seven beautiful Susan B Anthony dollars plus
one receipt.  I put the sticker back just like it had been. <br>Sweet.</p>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s now 3:50am Tuesday 9 February 1999.</p>

<p><p>Good night.</p>
