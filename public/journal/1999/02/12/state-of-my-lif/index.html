<p><p><b>STATE OF MY LIFE</b></p>

<p><p><ol></p>

<p><p><li>Manda has been found. She was never lost, but got swamped with school and Miss Texas preparations and life in general. When I got to talk with her, I said I was super glad she&rsquo;s busy, and asked that she simply let me know she&rsquo;s okay if she misses a meeting or date or something.</p>

<p><p><li>Yesterday I got a call from KTRU. <b>I got a job as a DJ there!!</b> I am so so so super pumped excited and wow!! We have a training / meeting thing at 2pm this Sunday and I am psyched!!
I&rsquo;ll get to say stuff like, &ldquo;You are listening to ninety-one point seven F M, K-Truue!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p><li>Dude and I finished recreating MR Labs website!  We were up until 5am this morning, with a goal to get it complete before he left at 2:30pm for 8 days in Nicaragua.  Check it out at <a href="https://www.mrlaboratories.com">www.mrlaboratories.com</a> Wheeee!!!!</p>

<p><p><li>Today at around 1:30pm after I woke up at noon, I heard a lot of clippin&rsquo; and cloppin&rsquo; outside my front windows..  It was a trail ride walking down the street - bunch of people on horses and a couple wagons and a police car at each end.  Wow!  So I put on my skates and caught up with them about a mile down the street.</p>

<p><p>I waved and talked to a couple of the riders and one guy, Larry, was all, &ldquo;grab onto my horses tail and I&rsquo;ll pull you!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;um, um..&rdquo; and didn&rsquo;t do it.</p>

<p><p>Then another woman offered the same thing and I was all, &ldquo;but what if he kicks?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t kick!&rdquo; piped up a woman behind her as she tugged on the horse&rsquo;s tail. &ldquo;See?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Cool.  So I grabbed firmly but gently onto her horse&rsquo;s tail and ziinngg!! She took off at a trot up along the rest of the riders!  Wow!  I got pulled on skates by a horse!  I did it 2 more times, once with the first girl and once with Larry, and I gave someone my camera to take a picture, so I will hopefully have one on the site soon!</p>

<p><p><li>Dude and I worked dutifully on MR Labs website, but today he has left for Nicaragua for 8 days or so.  I&rsquo;ve been spending so much time with him that I hardly will know what to do!</p>

<p><p>But we&rsquo;ve got some clients lined up, so I&rsquo;ll be creating some websites, including one for writers and one for an artist to advertise her work.
