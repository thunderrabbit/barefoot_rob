                        <p class=note>(transcribed from my diary)</p>
<p class=date>8am Tuesday 23 February 1999</p>

<p>I'm standing in line to get on the plane at Hobby Airport. This morning I woke early, scramble-packed and went to Dude's to take a shower as I washed some clothes at his house. We got them washed but not dried so I have a trash bag of damp shorts and undies in my bag here.  (I haven't done laundry in a while)

<p>Drove FAST to the airport 80mph and I'm here in plenty of time

<pre>- - - - - -</pre>

<p>Now I'm on the plane and have *six* seats to myself. This flight is pretty empty.  I'm sitting in the backwards-facing seats at the exit aisle.

<p><hr width="20%" align="left">

<p>Midflight landed in Jackson, Mississippe.  Been talking to Alexis, a student at Jersey Village, en route to Washington DC for a youth convention thing. Her dad is flying with her and will chill at her uncle's apparently.

<p>Oh my goodness this flight is still way unfull and Alexis and I have this next of all six seats to ourselves, with our stuff spread everywhere.

<p><hr width="20%" align="left">

<p>this flight has been particularly thankfully quiet and calm. The clouds below appear smooooth flat white supporting a brilliant blue sky. Now it has become bumpy as we decend through the clouds just in time for me to get back to my seat after a quiet stroll to each end of the fueslage.  People are mostly sleeping or reading; one guy is sleeping silently with his mouth gaping open.  |o

<p class=date>2:40pm Tuesday 23 February 1999</p>

<p>met Frank at LIDS, a cap store in Baltimore airport.  Talked about hats a bit and soon about music and raves and DJ and KTRU and he'll call me when he arrives in Houston this summer.

<p>He used to DJ from 1987 to 1993 I think and his homey lost all their records and turntables when he got evicted. Ouch. 6 years of collecting records gone.  Frank has wanted to DJ but not start over and he loves the old music that is hard to find now anyway.

<p class=date>8:56pm Tuesday 23 February 1999</p>

<p><font size="+1">HUGE</font> big hug from Jen as I stepped off the plane.  Super nice because I haven't been hugged bigly at the airport for most of my trips ('cept coming back from Albuquerque).

<p>We've been talk talk talkin' actually she's been talking showing me stuff as we drive.

<p><hr width="20%" align="left">

<p class=date>10pm or so</p>

<p><p>We dropped my wet clothes off into the community dryer below Jen&rsquo;s apartment; actually she lives in a big big three story yellow house that has been converted into multiple apartments. It&rsquo;s really cool how the stairs up the back were just kinda built along the prexisting side; maybe I&rsquo;ll get some pictures.</p>

<p><p>We stopped by a frozen river (A FROZEN RIVER!!) and threw rocks at it and they bouncy bounce bounced making a cool Star Wars-ish tonk sound each time they bounced.  I threw a big rock (as big a rock as I could heave 20 feet) and it more like thunked instead of tonked, but still reverberated the ice.</p>

<p><p>Then at at Taste of India, I had Shahi Paneer (actually 3 of us (Jen, Tammy and I) had that, and Randy had something else), Lassi (yogurt drink mango flavor), peshwari nan (unlevened baked bread with raisins and coconut), gulab jamun (fried bread in syrup).  We had met Tammy and Randy there, but we were late after bouncing the rocks on the river.  :-)</p>

<p><p>I enjoyed watching our quirks: Tammy is picky and pampered, Randy quiet and accomodating, Jen with her robot phobia, and me being from Texas, we had plenty of fun conversation.</p>

<p><p>There is no sales tax in New Hampshire, no helmet law, and no seat belt law.</p>

<p><p>We have just rented Hardware to scare Jen with robot stuff (she wanted to see it!)</p>

<p><p><hr width="20%" align="left"></p>

<p><p class=date>12:50am Wednesday 24 February 1999</p> (Wende&rsquo;s birthday)</p>

<p><p>Watched Hardware at Meagan&rsquo;s house, and Jen enjoyed it, but said it wasn&rsquo;t as scary as some different movie she saw. Meagan was on the phone pretty much the whole time so didn&rsquo;t get to watch the movie like at all.</p>

<p><p>Looked at Meagan&rsquo;s photo album and exchanged travel stories - me about Costa Rica; Jen and Meagan about England, and Meagan about hot springs in Arizona.</p>

<p><p>Back to Jen&rsquo;s we looked at <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> of my Costa Rica pics, but were too tired to continue.</p>

<p><p>Good Night.</p>

<p><p>With Love
<br>- Rob</p>
