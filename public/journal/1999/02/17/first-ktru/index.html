<p><p><h1>Oh my goodness</h1></p>

<p><p>That was so cool!!!!</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m not saying <em>I</em> did anything particularly cool, but I totally loved being a DJ, especially at KTRU, cause we play all kinds of random crazy good stuff, but nothing that you&rsquo;ll hear on commercial radio.</p>

<p><p>Michael was the DJ in charge of the shift, and he spoke first on the air, but I did the next 3 or 4 spoken portions (I&rsquo;m so new I don&rsquo;t even know what it&rsquo;s called!)</p>

<p><p>I read 2 PSAs (Public Service Announcements) and did the legal ID at the 11 o&rsquo;clock hour.  &ldquo;K-T-R-U, Houston&rdquo; and then read the PSA, then announced the KTRU Roller Prom which will be this Saturday and hella fun, and then reviewed the songs we had just played, and then cued the first song for the next DJ.</p>

<p><p>Okay, you may think I&rsquo;m weird after reading the following (you may already think I&rsquo;m weird, and for that I thank you), but the coolest <em>coolest</em> <b><em>!!coolest!!</em></b> thing I did was cue up a vinyl on the turntable. Just the simple act of zipping the record around by hand to find the exact spot where the song started, and to <em>hear</em> it all normal volume and stuff, and just playing with it back and forth over that part..  My heart lept with joy. I loved it. I know I must play on some turntables sometime. Got to got to got to. Gotta do what I love and I loved that.</p>

<p><p>Called Manda and got her cell phone, called Wende and she never came to the phone, called Wende a couple hours later and turns out she had heard me at the 11 o&rsquo;clock hour, and didn&rsquo;t even recognize me!  &ldquo;That was you??&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>She is my first confirmed listener that I know (I know we had others because people called in) but I like know her and stuff.
Nevermind.</p>

<p><p>I loved it and look forward to going back.  I&rsquo;ll be doing my second training this Monday, 3-5pm CST.  Even if you are not local, you can hear us on realaudio <a href="https://www.ktru.org">www.ktru.org</a> and listen on the web!  We are not a talk station, but we&rsquo;ll play some cool random tunes for you.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m actually going to go back to the station now to say HI to Meg, who I essentially know; she is the sister of Ellen, one of my youth in Dallas.</p>

<p><p>Yay!!!</p>
