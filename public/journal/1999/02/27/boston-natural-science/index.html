                        <p class=date>7:55pm Saturday 27 February 1999</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m in Boston at Marje&rsquo;s house, where she and Jen are playing a &ldquo;sexy flute duet&rdquo; for me. Jen and I went to the museum of natural science today and looked at lots of cool stuff including a big billiard ball track including a random splitter (the ball would fall onto a spinning plate and be randomly sent in one of four directions.</p>

<p><p>There was a rad display on the wall, like a huge collage but it was all white unless viewed through polarized filters.  So they had a slowly spinning filter some 50 feet away that made the collage seem to slowly oscillate through colors and stuff, making some portions visible, some blacked-out, some whited-out.. it was crazy cool and I wish I had taken some pics! (Maybe I&rsquo;ll surf and find some..  okay, here is a link to what they call the <a href="https://www.mos.org/tour/maptour4.html">Polage (polarized collage)</a>.  This was linked without permission from the <a href="https://www.mos.org">Boston Museum of Science</a>.)
<br>That image gives a hint of what it is like.  To the bottom right of the picture in the foreground are the slowly spinning filters I described above.</p>

<p><p>We saw a SETI movie in the planetarium, which was fun and mildly educational for me.  I learned the location of the constellation Taurus, and something else I forgot.</p>

<p><p>We saw the movie &ldquo;Thrill Ride&rdquo; in their huge Omnimax <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> sphere huge domed screen.. It featured some roller coasters and general thrill ride technology. Embarassingly enough (considering I had laughed at the idea of queasiness), I felt a bit nauseous after the show, but I think that feeling was enhanced by me having only eaten a single blueberry muffin and orange juice that day some hours earlier.</p>

<p><p>Saw a super duper way way cool electricity show, featuring 4 tesla coils, and two HUGE enormous van de graff generators - the largest in the world (?) that produce 2.5 million volts together.  I took several pics of that show; we&rsquo;ll see how they come out.</p>

<p><p>Road the &ldquo;T&rdquo; (their mass transit train) to and from the museum and ate pizza at some pizza place. I ordered it and  had a vague thought of, &ldquo;hmmm $9 is kinda expensive for a personal pizza&rdquo; but it turns out it was a huge full sized pizza and I only ate 1 slice and carried the rest back in a big full sized pizza box&hellip;  So I had a big pizza on the train and I felt a bit conspicuous. I appear to have survived the ordeal. ;-)</p>
