<p class=date>11:24am Wednesday 24 February 1999</p>

<p>Today is Wende's birthday.

<p>I got up, checked email (around 100 messages) after helping Jen with dishes. Most of the email I get is crap; I will ponder how to correct this sometime.

<p class=date>12:20pm Wednesday 24 February 1999</p>

<p>Played on the ice of Jen's creek and threw big rocks at it. I probably could have walked on it before I cracked it. Went up and got the camera and took a pic of me sliding on the driveway.  Back down to the creek but my angels said, "naw" with a vision of me falling through the ice.  So we're driving to the ocean.

<p class=date>12:48pm</p>

<p>Just stopped at a bridge over river and "floppy ice" as Jen calls it for a few more pics.  Floppy ice is cool - it's tidal water that had frozen then the tide goes out and the ice slowly collapses onto the rocks below as the water leaves from underneath it.  The effect is like a huge perfectly broken sheet of glass over bumpy rocks.  Except the glass is not sharp and it's really cold.  (fun to throw too)

<p class=date>2:49pm</p>

<p>Drove through a hilly chilly forest and Jen pointed out Joe's bro's house, but no one was there that we noticed.  Continued along the curvy road and then *bing* we were at a beach! Parked, got out and *bing* there's Joe walking toward us!  Jen and Joe hugged big and I said HI and stuff. He had just been at The Chair, a popular place to chill.

<p>The beach was broad expansive sand with hella cold wind. Finally got to The Chair, which I was really impressed with how sweet it was... a beautiful chair shaped rock, like a natural jetty Lay-Z-Boy beside a bay. We sat there in the near silence, watching a bay of waves slowly wash to shore. So peaceful that I began to fall asleep and actually did- just curled up sideways and slept about 1/2 an hour. The rock conveniently blocked the otherwise biting cold wind.

<p>Walked back to Joe's and froze my nose and toes; actually we just walked back to the car, but it was pretty cold enough and drove to Joe's bro's and warmed up by the wood stove.  After I was sufficiently warm to brave the sub freezing arctic blizzard (well okay there was no snow, but it was about 20 degrees), Joe, Jen and I went to Portsmouth to eat at The Friendly Toast. 

<p>Funny: on the way there, Jen saw a pickup truck with wide tires and stuff and she was all, "that's a weird truck," and I'm all, "really?  it's perfectly normal in Houston."  We soon noticed it had Texas license plates, and upon closer inspection was purchased from a Houston dealer. :-)

<p class=date>7:16pm</p>

<p><p>Joe, Jen and I ate at The Friendly Toast, and it was super cool.  Crazy garage sale items decorated the entire place; no more than 4 or 6 identical items could be found in the restaurant, including plates, silverware, cups, everything!</p>

<p><P>Back at Jens&rsquo; house we played on the frozen creek, and I learned I had the good fortune to see clear ice.. normally it will freeze but be snow covered and therefore opaque.  But we were able to walk on it and see right through to the silent brown leaves at the bottom.  The ice was two inches thick at minimum (except where tree branches kept it from freezing at all) and water flowed beneath it.  There&rsquo;s a little waterfall thing as a result of some old old old concrete bridge built a hundred years ago. We took a couple of pictures.</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;re upstairs listening to some tunes and playing Cosmic Wimpout, a fun Yatzee-ish game.</p>

<p><p>Meagan came over and reminisced with Joe (the all used to be roommates in college) and actually ended up driving him back home as Jen was pretty much way too tired.</p>

<p><p>Crazy: Joe lives in Maine, but it&rsquo;s only 30 minutes to his house.</p>
