<p><p><b>STATE OF MY LIFE</b></p>

<p><p><ol></p>

<p><p><li>I recently came to the realization that my life feels too busy/complicated lately. With help from Wende, I pondered this in my diary and found that back in my college days, I was busy, but not quite as busy as now. Also, back then some of my busi-ness included good exercise (Ultimate and disc golf), good friends (hanging at the dorms) and good food (dorm food is more balanced than my current eating habits)
<br>Hmmmm.
<br>Wende also pointed out that my life had 1 big focus: COLLEGE. Now I have a couple of big foci: Business/financial, Youth group work, men&rsquo;s group, my websites/email
<br>Hmmmm.</li></p>

<p><p><li>For New Year&rsquo;s I went to Northwoods Unitarian Church (the one I grew up in) for a youth lock-in. We played Sardines, Silent Football, watched movies, and made a life sized pinata of Jason Fricke!</li></p>

<p><p><li>This weekend I&rsquo;m going to Atlanta for a FlashNet conference! I&rsquo;m super excited about it; and expect to return with a plethora of ideas and energy to build my business (and my busi-ness!)</li></p>

<p><p><li>Yesterday I made some <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> page flyers advertising my FlashNet business and handed out small stacks to four different apartment complexes. They were all quite happy to put them in with their Move-In packets for all new residents! Yay!!</li></p>

<p><p><li>Manda and I recently went to see Rush Hour at the theater on family night when every seat is 50 cents! We spent an equal amount on a pinball game before the movie, and she totally kicked my ass at it! She did so well that she kept getting bonuses and extra turns and everything and it actually made us a tad late to the movie! Watching her do so well was worth the wait. Today I bought her an orange &ldquo;Push Up&rdquo; ice cream thing and a Kit Kat for myself.</li></p>

<p><p><li>It&rsquo;s after midnight and I still haven&rsquo;t packed for this weekend!!! Shannon is picking me up at 6:30am (actually her boyfriend is driving us).</li></p>

<p><p><li>It&rsquo;s one week and 20 hours until the Houston Rally and we still need 30+ registrations in order to break even. I know we&rsquo;ll do it; the forms will begin to flood in up until the last minute!</li></p>

<p><p><li>I took Spot (my cat) to the vet for his yearly check-up, and he still weighs 8 pounds just like last year!</li></p>

<p><p><li>In February I&rsquo;m going to see Jen in New Hampshire!  See, she is coming down to Houston in August to visit Rice University and I was all, &ldquo;do you realize how hot it will be in August?&rdquo;  and the conversation grew to the point where we decided to exchange cities during the most extreme temperatures of the year.  Makes sense to me!!  (BTW, today I think it got up to 79 degrees in Houston)</li>
