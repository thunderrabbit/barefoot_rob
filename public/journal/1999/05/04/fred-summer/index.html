G -

Georgia was pretty cool, and so is Brandie!  We went to Six Flags (she
didn't ride any rides) and went to a park around there.   The rides
were fairly cool; however, the new Batman ride wasn't as cool as I had
expected.  Don't get me wrong, it was pretty cool, but the line was
two hours, and I liked the Georgia Scorcher better.  I also rode
Viper, which has five (count 'em, 5) inversions and was really quite
cool, especially considering that it wasn't made by B&M or Vekoma.
(It was probably Arrow Dynamics.)  I didn't get any pictures, as I
left my cameras in the car.  That's okay, though, since I'll be
spending 2-3 months in Georgia this summer.  I talked to one of the
guys there, and he really really me to work with him because of my
math background.  I told him that I had decided on attending Stanford,
but that I'd love to work with him in the summer, and he accepted!  

So I'm gonna finish my thesis in record time, and be off to Georgia
shortly thereafter.  That puts some constraints on when I can go to
Six Flags (over Texas) and Astroworld, but opens up the possibility--
no, the eventuality-- that I'll go to Busch Gardens and Paramount's
King's Dominion in Virginia.  I may also go to Boston for Memorial Day
weekend with some friends here.  Fucked up, huh?  

Well, I've got to get to work.
