                        <p class=date>9pm Tuesday 19 May 1999</p>

<p><p>Today Jason and I worked for a few hours pulling phone cables down walls at a company where I installed about 28 cables, but hadn&rsquo;t pulled them down the walls.  We didn&rsquo;t have exactly the right tools to use, but we had a lot of fun and got most of them done.</p>

<p><p>We could have finished them all, but at noon, we had to leave.  I asked Renee, &ldquo;have you ever listened to KTRU?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I told her and then explained we would be leaving before completing the job and she could listen to us on the radio!</p>

<p><p>Packed up, went home, cleaned up, to the station, cued up a record and we had a blast.  Jason focused a lot on the ska stack, and the general stack, and I played pretty much whatever he gave me.  We inadvertantly played a song &ldquo;I want to be a punk&rdquo; by the Blanks 77 that said &ldquo;fuck you&rdquo; in it 13 times, but the voice was pretty much unintelligible; I didn&rsquo;t even notice until the end of the song since I was busy on the phone and stuff.</p>

<p><p>Got lots of requests on the phone (I guess that&rsquo;s what happens with a day shift), and was able to play about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> of them.  I couldn&rsquo;t find the rest, though I&rsquo;m sure part of that is simply due to my lack of knowledge about where various artists are located.</p>

<p><p>At one point I found Jimi Hendrix playing a live version of &ldquo;Wild Thing&rdquo; and I was all, cool! and went to play that back to back with Kermit the Frog&rsquo;s rendition of &ldquo;Wild Thing&rdquo; and Kermit CD was missing!!!</p>

<p><p>I was angry that someone would steal the Kermit Unpigged CD, and I told the station manager it was missing.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We pulled it out of the stacks; it was never supposed to be here in the first place, and it was being played <b>way</b> too much.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well can I have it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sure.  As long as you don&rsquo;t play it here.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Yay!!!  So the CD is recovered into my private collection.</p>

<p><p>Though it took a while, Jason finally became more comfortable talking on the air, not a lot, but that&rsquo;s cool.</p>

<p><p>At one point I had <em>Less Than Jake</em> CD cued up for him.  &ldquo;So Jason, what can you tell me about this band that I don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Who me?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Um, yes, not anyone else.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re&hellip;good.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>(pause)</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Okay fair enough,&rdquo; I laughed and played the song.</p>

<p><p>Wende came in (she had the afternoon off work) and helped choose CDs and helped me find some requested songs. That was great.  She found The Judys for me, and something else.</p>

<p><p>She was even more mic shy than Jason, but when she gave me a CD to play for her I was all, &ldquo;so Wende, what song is this?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>(silence)</p>

<p><p>I turned the mic toward her, &ldquo;all ears are on you&hellip;&rdquo; I taunted.</p>

<p><p>Finally she overcame her fear. &ldquo;This is I-three with blah blah blah&rdquo; whatever it was.</p>

<p><p>Jason goes, &ldquo;very professional.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Then she even gave the name of the CD and I played it.</p>

<p><p>But, for the Big Huge Culmination of our show, we sang The Yogi Bear song live with no intro, no rehearsal, nothin.  It was great!  All you YRUUers would love it!  Jason has a tape of the show and most of the song recorded.  (I forgot to hit Record for the first 3 verses)</p>

<p><p>A song finished, I turned on the mic, we sang, I turned off the mic, I played another song.</p>

<p><p>Our shift was soon over, though the next DJ hadn&rsquo;t come in.  Meg said she would cover for him.  I put in Frankenstein Symphony and we left.</p>
