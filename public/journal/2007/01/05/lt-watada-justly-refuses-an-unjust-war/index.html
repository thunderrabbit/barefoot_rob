<p>##09:03 Friday 05 January 2007</p>

<p><strong>Letter from Carolyn Ho – mother of Lt Watada</strong></p>

<p>Dear Friends,</p>

<p>On behalf of Lt. Watada and our family, thank you for standing with us during this most difficult time. Because of his refusal to deploy to the illegal and immoral Iraq War, my son now faces a maximum of 6 years in a military prison. The pretrial is scheduled for Jan. 4, 2007.  The court martial is calendared for Feb. 5, 2007.</p>

<p>We are just days away from the pretrial and must broaden his support base. Help us mobilize the local, national, and international community through your personal, professional, religious and other networks. Please forward the attached email alert with a brief explanation. Ask people to go to: <a href="https://www.thankyoult.org/">www.thankyoult.org</a> to learn more about Lt. Watada&rsquo;s case. On the main menu, supporters can click on SIGN PETITION/GET UPDATES AND ALERTS.  They will receive weekly email updates that call for actions in support of  Lt. Watada&rsquo;s stand.</p>

<p>Encourage your contacts to integrate these actions into the anti-war activism they are already doing.  Their voices are critical to building an international public opinion campaign that demands justice and no punishment for Lt. Watada.  His voice of resistance to this heinous war cannot be silenced!</p>

<p>In Solidarity,</p>

<p>Carolyn Ho (Lt. Watada&rsquo;s Mother)</p>

<p>&ldquo;The war in Iraq is in fact illegal. It is my obligation and my duty to refuse any orders to participate in this war. An order to take part in an illegal war is unlawful in itself. So my obligation is not to follow the order to go to Iraq.&rdquo; - Lt. Ehren Watada</p>

<p>****<strong>Make your 2007 New Year&rsquo;s Resolution to Stand with Lt. Watada Against Illegal and Immoral War</strong></p>

<p>On Monday, February 5, 2007 take action against the Iraq war and in support of Lt. Watada during his military court martial.  Stand up with Lt. Watada and speak out against the illegal and immoral war!******  Join the national movement and organize student walkouts and non-violent demonstrations.  Together let&rsquo;s build a mass movement in the streets, in our schools, and in our communities to end the Iraq War.**  On Feb. 5, 2007 rally at the gates of Fort Lewis, Washington or in your local community.</p>

<p>For courageously standing up and speaking out against the Iraq War, New Year&rsquo;s Eve 2007 may be Lt. Watada&rsquo;s last holiday as a free man until 2013.  While many 28 year-olds are starting their families and building their careers, Ehren will be locked away in military prison for following his conscience and refusing to fight in the Iraq War.</p>

<p>****<strong>Now it is time for you to follow your conscience and join the national movement to support Lt. Watada and end the Iraq war.</strong></p>

<p>As civilians, the responsibility ultimately falls on us to demand an end to the Iraq war.  In fact, we owe it to the soldiers who are fighting and dying in Iraq every day, as well as those resisting the war. We must all stand up and speak out against the war and in support Lt. Ehren Watada!</p>

<p>Currently, the Bush Administration is planning to deploy 30,000 more U.S. troops to Iraq, yet the overwhelming majority of Americans oppose the Iraq war. Since 2003 the war has cost 3,000 U.S. soldiers&rsquo; lives, approximately 950,000 Iraqi deaths, 2 trillion U.S tax dollars or approximately 8 billion dollars a week. We can no longer stand by and continue to allow this great injustice to occur!</p>

<p>__<em>&ldquo;My fellow soldiers are fighting and dying in Iraq and their families are suffering because of the lies and deceptions crafted by the Bush Administration.  The Iraq war is not only a crime against domestic and international law but [it] is a terrible moral injustice against the Iraqi people.&rdquo;  Lt. Ehren Watada</em></p>

<p>As the first Army officer to publicly speak out against the war and refuse deployment to Iraq, Lt Watada will be punished by the U.S. Army with a maximum six years in prison.****** The military&rsquo;s intention IS to SILENCE VOICES OF RESISTANCE and make an example out of Lt. Watada.**</p>

<p>Lt. Watada&rsquo;s bold actions have raised the consciousness of thousands of Americans about the illegality and immorality of this war, but his actions alone will not stop the Iraq war.  If Lt. Watada is willing to sacrifice his freedom, then we, too, must voice our opposition and take action to end the war.</p>

<p>****<strong>Take Action Feb. 5, 2007 during Lt. Watada&rsquo;s military court martial and make your 2007 New Year&rsquo;s Resolution to Stand with Lt. Watada Against Illegal and Immoral War.</strong></p>
