                        <h1>1997 Tulsa rally review by Rob Nugen</h1>

<hr>

<p><p>
Wow.
<p>
9 hours is not so bad if you have 3 drivers.  However, it&rsquo;s kinda cramped
when you have 8 people in a 7 passenger minivan.  But for a rally, we&rsquo;ll
do anything.  On the way up from Houston to Tulsa were 3 advisors: Rob Nugen
(that&rsquo;s me), Wende Whitlock, and Dierdre Hammons, and 5 youth: Mike Noyse,
Charlotte Benbenek-Price, Jon Whitten-Lege, Tony Salinas, and April Ambrose.
That is an unusually high ratio of advisors to youth, but no one seemed to mind.
<p>
We left Houston at around 3pm and got to Tulsa at like 12:30am.  Surprisingly,
we were not the last group to show up.  A lot of the youth from Tulsa were all
rally virgins, so I knew none of the first people who ran screaming up to greet
us.  Some of the youth knew each other, though:  Mike Noyse said to someone,
&ldquo;oh hey- you remember those shoes you gave me 2 years ago and I said I would
give you 20 bucks for them?  I&rsquo;ve got the 20 bucks.&rdquo;  We joked about him instead
concluding, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the shoes.&rdquo;
<p>
Inside we registered and posed for mugbook pictures and talked and played a
huge game of Twister where they had 12 Twister mats all spread across the floor
and various people twisting across the mats.  We played fooz ball, pool, ping
pong and talked and goofed around until a line of people holding hands began to
snake through the two rooms and collect people on its ever-lengthening tail until
the entire rally was a long hand-holdin&rsquo; line walking outside
to the large dining hall
for opening circle.<br />
<p>
We circled and opened the rally by each person asking a personal question of the
person to his or her right, who introduced him or herself and answered the
questions.  I was asked (by Mike Moren, I think) &ldquo;what is the worst
pick-up line you&rsquo;ve used?&rdquo;  I said I don&rsquo;t have any pick-up lines&ndash;I
just charm people with my smile,
which understandably illicited many groans from the rest of the group.
<p>
After opening circle, we cruised back to the main building and had touch group
meetings.  Advisors talked advisor stuff upstairs and the various youth touch
groups talked youth stuff all over the place.  Then the groups dispersed and
I went back down to the game room.  I don&rsquo;t currently remember what I did, but
I remember reminding everyone at 4am that we were supposed to be awake in 3.5
hours for the ropes course, and that I was going to bed.
<p>
Slept, got up, went outside to find Mike Noyse and Gabe Rendon creating large
sidewalk chalk drawings in the parking lot.  I don&rsquo;t know the current jargon,
but Gabe had drawn some hip hoppin&rsquo; guy flipping his middle finger right out
at you and holding a cigarette fully 4 feet long.  Pretty impressive art
for overnight sidewalk chalk drawings&hellip;
<p>
We piled everyone and everything into the cars and drove to the YMCA for a
day of fun in the sun.   First thing I did was ask the main ropes course dude
if I could go barefoot on the course.  He said, &ldquo;no sir.  You may walk anywhere
you want on the ground without shoes, but not on the course.  There may be a
wire pulled loose from one of the cables, and it could stab you pretty well.&rdquo;
That is one good reason that I had not considered.
<p>
We tossed all our junk in the pavillion and split into two groups.  Before the
groups were split, I mentally decided to go with the group that does the low
ropes stuff first.  I determined that way I would wear my feet out to the point
that I wouldn&rsquo;t mind wearing shoes on the course.  I was correct.  But don&rsquo;t
tell anyone.
<p>
We played several games.  The coolest 5 that I remember are<br>
<ol>
<li><b>Mafia</b> Where the group makes a circle and copies the motions that the
gang boss is making in order to conceal the identity of the boss.
IT, the detective,
tries to determine who&rsquo;s the boss.</li>
<li><b>Multiple Dodgeball</b> (I made that name up) where the whole group runs around
and tries not to get hit by any of many balls being thrown around.  If you are hit,
you have to kneel down until whoever tagged you is hit, and then you can get up and
play again.  It&rsquo;s quite a fun and tiring game.</li>
<li><b>Hackey Ball</b> (I made that name up) Using the same balls, we tried to
keep them from hitting the ground.  We were allowed to use our hands, but only
got points for not using our hands.</li>
<li><b>Lava</b> (I made that name up)  We were split into two groups and each group
was given 4 small pieces of carpet.  We had to get everyone across the lava (grass)
without touching the lava, or leaving pieces of carpet unattended.</li>
<li><b>Rope Crossing</b> (of course I made that name up) We had to get the entire
group over a rope without touching it, but with each member of the group always touching
at least one other member of the group.  I got to jump over first, and we developed
a technique where basically people were lifted up onto my back and slid down (hopefully)
into the arms of the group.  I used Dane Dormio and someone else as stable bases on the
opposite side of the rope and we tossed everyone over.  Quite fun.  Curtis MacCormack
completed the process by jumping over the rope and doing a half-twist to make it
look cool.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Then it was time for lunch.
<p>
We ate and played frisbee a bit and I climbed all over the swingset.  The break was
not tremendously long before it was time for our group to do the high ropes course
stuff.  Yay!!
<p>
Bud was our main adult leader dude, and he showed us the ropes, and everything we
would need to know about them.
<p>
&ldquo;Spotter ready?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Spotter ready.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Climbing?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Climb on!&rdquo;<br>
<p>
Up the first pole and then walk up the next slanted log, then climb some more to the
next horizontal log.  Walk across the horizontal log being careful not to hurt the
leaves of the tree branch brushing across it.  Then
<p>
&ldquo;Transfering!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Transfer On!&rdquo;<br>
<p>
and you switch to the next safety rope thing.
<p>
&ldquo;Transfer complete!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Show me!&rdquo;<br>
And you show &lsquo;em.<br>
&ldquo;Squeeze me!&rdquo;<br>
And you squeeze &lsquo;em.<br>
&ldquo;Transfer complete!&rdquo;<br>
<p>
And you jump/step across to a suspended lily pad thing and
across to a stable platform and switch to the next rope thing.
<p>
&ldquo;Transfering!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Transfer On!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Transfer complete!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Show me!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Squeeze me!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Transfer complete!&rdquo;<br>
<p>
And then along a long long single cable with ropes hanging above
it about 5 feet long and 5 feet apart.  They call this section the
grape vine, and it was the first where
you actually step on a single cable, and I quickly realized I was
glad to be wearing my shoes.
<p>
&ldquo;Transfering!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Transfer On!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Transfer complete!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Show me!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Squeeze me!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Transfer complete!&rdquo;<br>
<p>
And then along the &ldquo;Charlie Chaplin&rdquo; lines, two parallel cables that you
kinda shuffle across.  The right foot cable hung several inches lower than
the other, so I just used the left cable.
<p>
&ldquo;Transfering!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Transfer On!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Transfer complete!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Show me!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Squeeze me!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Transfer complete!&rdquo;<br>
<p>
And along the last cable, with a cable about 3.5 feet above it as a handle.
It was about 60 feet long.<br>
At the end of this set of cables was Pam, sitting on a platform about 40 or 50
feet in the air helping people switch to the last safety rope, the one for the
zip cord.  I talked to her for a few minutes, asking about her work and stuff.
I yelled stuff like, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared!&rdquo; to the people at the bottom waiting for me
to zip, and did a one foot shakey wavey dance to show how off balance and nervous
I was (not).  I appreciated the view for a moment and then gave Pam a hug.
&ldquo;Thank you, Pam, for all your help out here.&rdquo;
<p>
&ldquo;Clear??&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Clear!!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Zipping??&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Zip On, BA-BYYY!!!!<br>
<p>
And jump and zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzeeeeeeeeewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!!!!
down the long long long cable 35 m.p.h. upside down past the people at the bottom
and slow then backwards upside down zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz past them again and then
crazy legs sideways zzzzzzzz past them again and then zzz and grab the rope and
attach it to my cable and stop and unhook and down the ladder safely to the ground.
<p>
Wild awesome fabulous fun.
<p>
I helped out with the group helping people get down off the zip line until I
helped Wende go through the ropes course itself.  There was a delay, so she had
to stay up there a bit longer than most people.  I yelled, &ldquo;Wende!  Yell, &lsquo;Chilling!&rsquo;
so I can yell, &lsquo;Chill On!&rsquo;&rdquo;  but she didn&rsquo;t think that was very funny.
<p>
After everyone had gone, we cruised back to the pavillion and chilled.
Soon, the pool was open, so we got to go play in the pool.  Yay!  I mostly
played a game of Marco Polo with Frank Roesler, Dane Dormio, Nick Grunewald,
Mike Moren, and a few others but I don&rsquo;t remember who.  (it&rsquo;s been too long since
the rally!)  We got bored of &ldquo;Marco&rdquo; followed by &ldquo;Polo&rdquo; so we started doing all
variety of name associations from people first and last names, to days of the
week, to articles of clothing, to song lyrics, to record labels.  Crazy..
<p>
We got bored of the whole game, though not quite as bored, I&rsquo;m sure, as the life
guards, and went to eat, because it was dinnertime!  Yay!
<p>
We ate and
I grabbed my frisbee and went to the basketball court and we got a game of
frisbee going.  I was glad for the chance to help a few youth learn how to throw
and for a few other youth to throw better.  I love that.  We played for probably
an hour or hour-na-half and it was great.
<p>
Worship was awesome, though difficult to hear over the crackling of the fire
and singing of some youth.  We did a round of Unreturned Love (that&rsquo;s not what
it&rsquo;s called but I can&rsquo;t remember the name) where half the group stands with
eyes closed and the other half walks around and hugs everyone.  Then the sides
switch and you do it again.  It&rsquo;s great; I&rsquo;ll suggest we do that at SWUUSI.
<p>
We cruised back to the church and hung out until time for the Love Feast.
This one was held outside and was much more gentle and sane than the
notorious New Orleans Love Feast turned Food Fling Festival from last year.
I ate a crazy mixture of cheese, M&amp;Ms, carrots, crackers, fruit, over and over
until I was just barfily full.  Thanks to everyone who helped.
<p>
Back inside we chilled more, until some people suggested
getting together a talent show.  Unfortunately, as I was walking around
inviting people to the show, I got pulled into a hasty meeting.<br />
Some youths had broken the no smoking rule and we had to figure out what
to do.  Shit.  I did not want to deal with the situation, but we
decided what would be appropriate and talked to the youths in question
and told them their punishment and blah.  Done.  I hate having to do that.
<p>
Soon thereafter, I was invited to a game of Truth or Dare.  Oh no.<br />
My better judgement said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t play&rdquo; but I did anyway.  We had fun.
I won&rsquo;t name names, and in fact, I won&rsquo;t even say what happened.
You&rsquo;ll have to ask.  It wasn&rsquo;t as bad as you&rsquo;re thinking.
<p>
Okay, fine.  One youth got a swirly, one youth got naked (alone)
in the elevator,
one youth put their underwear in the middle of the circle, and
then I had to go get some sleep.
<p>
We got up, cleaned up, packed up, and had closing circle.  The
seniors had senior circle in the middle, and then we all did a big tight
spiral hug around them.  Nice.
<p>
Muffins and juice for the ride home and we left.<br>
I talked to Charlotte Benbenek-Price about Marilyn Manson.  We wondered
about the band and about Mr Manson&rsquo;s motivations for things.  <br>
I was introduced to Type O-Negative, a cool group that my brain
is thinking had a sound like a smooth industrial, ambient mix.<br />
Fun stuff.
<p>
Also weird was Ben Atkinson&rsquo;s Bizarre magazine.  I&rsquo;m glad my small
part of the world does not include some of the crazy stuff in there.
<p>
Have a great day!<br>
- Rob</p>
