                        <h1>1997 Tulsa rally review by Dane dormio</h1>

<hr>

<p>Well, two years, twelve rallies and two SWUUSIs later, I finally
got to go back to the site of my first rally, the All Souls UU
church in Tulsa.  I&rsquo;m sure anyone who has been going to rallies for a
while will understand how special a place this was for me.  It was
great to see the old church again and think about how completely
different a person I am now than I was then.  All the familiar sights
were etched in my memory, and it seemed like nothing had changed.  A
wonderful experience.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>Other than that, I must admit, I expected the Tulsa &lsquo;97 rally to be
the only bad one I had ever been to.  Boy, was I wrong.  It was a
very non-standard rally experience and will definitely stand out
among the rest in the future.  One non-standard thing was, of course,
the notorious anti-smoking rule.  Both sides of this battle deserve
to be commended:  the Tulsa church for standing up and saying &ldquo;No
Smoking&rdquo; (that took a lot of guts), and the smokers who came anyway
and put up with the rule with very little friction.  But there were
also other things that made this rally different.  It was probably
the smallest one I&rsquo;ve ever been to; I would estimate about 40 people
were there, give or take a few.  It seemed like at least a quarter of
these were rally virgins from Tulsa.  I had no idea they had such a
large youth group.  There was also a Love Feast, which is rare.<br />
Then, of course, there was the church it was in, which is a big thing
in itself.  And, probably the most unusual, the R.O.P.E.S. course at
the YMCA that took up most of the day Saturday.  What a rush!
</p>
<p></p>

<p>For me, one other thing that made this rally unique was an
extra-special friend I made Thursday night who came with me:  Dave,
the plunger.  Sure, he&rsquo;s non-human, but non-human objects are
people too, and most people take for granted just how much life,
warmth, and personality plungers can have when you look at one of
them carefully enough and give it a fair chance.  All they want is to
be treated equally and given the love that any other person would
expect, not for their physical appearance alone, but for what a
beautiful, twinkling, caring soul lies within the flimsy rubber
shell.  Dave is a true plunger pioneer, and he had a lot of fun at
the rally and made a lot of good friends.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>My mom couldn&rsquo;t come to this rally, so Dave and I rode in a van with
Gene Hudnall, Nick Grunewald, Helen Cole, and Gene&rsquo;s mom Sheila, all
from Little Rock.  About the time we got into Tulsa, we realized that
none of us had bothered to bring a map to the church, which was no
big deal because a nice man at a gas station knew right where it was.
It was relatively early when we arrived, a little before ten o&rsquo;clock,
and the only people there were Tera Little and her two YUUTEs from
Fayetteville, Andy and Laura Andrews from Tyler, TX, Ben Atkinson, who
had flown in, and a large number of people from the Tulsa youth
group.  Getting to rallies early is a mixed blessing; you get to meet
everyone else as they arrive, but you have to wait, at a time when
you are about to explode with happy energy.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>Eventually people arrived from Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and OKC,
and opening circle was postponed half an hour to wait for the
stragglers because there were so few of us.  For the ice breaker,
everyone in the circle asked the person to his or her right a
get-to-know-you question, and that person answered, and it went all
the way around.  Then everything for tomorrow was explained, all the
rules, boundaries, etc.  When we were dismissed, we all went
back to the main part of the church and had touch group meetings.<br />
There weren&rsquo;t really any big, clear rooms where there was a lot of
space to run around, so the general partying was more mild than
usual, and people either sat on any of the numerous couches or played
pool or ping-pong.  There was also the art wall in the Sponge Room,
which had been painted over since the last rally, and it was soon
totally covered in magic-marker graffiti.  Since the group was so
small, the atmosphere was less energetic, but no less cheery, than
normal.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>In the morning breakfast was cooked and eaten, and shortly
afterwards everyone piled back into their vehicles and we all
caravanned to the Westside YMCA for a day of fun in the trees.  </p>
<p></p>

<p>As soon as we got there, the six touch groups were divided up and
three were taken directly to the R.O.P.E.S. course while the other
three played rally-variety games in a grassy field.  Dave and I were
in the latter group, so we spent the first hour or two running around
in the sun playing while the other group was gliding through the
trees.  We had a little bit of fun and learned a few fun new games,
like a weird form of dodge ball which will probably be played again,
but most of the time I would have rather just sat in the shade.  It
was hot!  We took a long break for lunch, then went back to playing
games.  The last thing we did was try to get everyone over a rope
strung between two trees.  The drawback was that we couldn&rsquo;t touch
the rope, and everyone had to be touching someone else the whole
time.  Rob was our pillar of strength for this little exercise;
he leaned out over the rope and as we handed them over he let the
whole group slide down his back to a gaggle of waiting arms on the
other side, one person at a time.  Curtis was the last one over, and
touching Rob across the rope he did an effortless little hop/spin
right over, completing the exercise.  Impressive.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>We took a second, shorter break to eat, drink, and rest before
heading up to the R.O.P.E.S. course.  There we were given a crash
course on all the procedures and things we would need to know in
order to not die.  It was fairly simple once you got the hang of it.
After watching a few other people go before me, it was my turn to don
the safety rope and climb the pillar.  Dave stayed behind and
watched, because the course was too dangerous for plungers, and he
had plenty to keep him busy besides.  The first thing I did was hook
the safety line to the loop on my harness, then I climbed up the
thick wooden pole with my spotter Tom making sure I didn&rsquo;t fall.<br />
Just like I had seen it done before, I walked out across the log,
just as calm as could be.  About halfway across, though, I started to
think about what I was doing and was hit by a twinge of nervousness.<br />
I pushed it out of my mind and tried to be as relaxed as possible
from then on.  I got to the end of that one and climbed up to the
next one, and walked across it to the starting platform.  I changed
safety lines, then hopped out onto the wobbly &ldquo;lilly pad&rdquo; suspended
thirty feet in the air, and bounded across to the next platform.  I
changed safety lines again, then started across a twenty-to
thirty-yard open stretch, balancing on a single wire and using my
safety line to hold myself up and pulling myself across by ropes that
were dangling every few feet.  I made my wobbly way across and hugged
the next pole as soon as it was within reach.  I crawled around it
and stood on the two wires running out from the other side to change
safety lines again, then made my way across them about ten feet in
the same manner as I had gone across the other wire.  This one didn&rsquo;t
have the suspended ropes, and it was a little more wobbly, but it
wasn&rsquo;t nearly as long as the first stretch so it was easier.  At the
end of it was another platform where I changed safety lines again and
took off on another set of wires.  These were three wires running one
above the other, and they turned to the right at a 90 degree angle
to the wires I had just navigated.  My feet were balancing on the
bottom wire, my safety line was attached to the top one, and I was
holding onto the middle one to keep myself up.  That stretched out
for about another twenty or thirty yards, and when I got off it, Pam,
one of the YMCA adults running the course, helped me onto her
platform and I put the zipper line on and shucked my old safety line.
When everything was clear, I jumped off the platform and went
whizzing down through the air at all the people, and zipped past them
at a breezy 35 m.p.h.  I ran out of momentum and flew back a little
slower, then cycled by a third and fourth time, and the fourth time I
was going slow enough that I could grab a rope from someone on the
ground and pull myself over to the ladder and climb down.  The wind
had cooled me off nicely, and I sat at the shady picnic table with
Dave and waited for everybody else to finish.  The course was unfair
to Rob, because he had to put shoes on for it, but he did it anyway.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>The rest of the evening was free time.  The pool didn&rsquo;t open until
six, so people found other ways to pass the time until then.  Food
was being served all the time, and there was much more than enough of
it.  I started to go canoeing with Nick Grunewald, but when I got
there I found out that the &ldquo;pond&rdquo; was nothing but an oversized puddle
of slightly diluted mixed animal waste products that probably had a
microbial count of fifteen billion deadly, germy, sharp-clawed and
pointy-teethed, highly infectious, very very mean and out-to-get-me
unpleasant organisms per cubic milliliter, and all they wanted was
just a chance to touch a single skin cell and invade my body and
liquefy my brain and internal organs, rot out my bowels, and turn my
skin into stone.  Not to mention the rather offensive odor.  Dave and
I left right away.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>Later hamburgers and veggie burgers were cooked, and all the usual
cookout food.  There were people playing on the playground, playing
basketball, and just sitting around the pavilion talking.  When the
pool opened, quite a few people got in and swam.  Dave sat on the
side and soaked up the mild evening sun, because he is not the best
of swimmers, although he does do a really good impersonation of a
jellyfish underwater.  (Dave is a plunger of many hidden talents.<br />
For instance, he is a hula-hoop expert.)  I played Marco Polo with a
large group of people for quite some time.  To make it more
interesting, we used a few new techniques that Nick Grunewald came up
with:  Submarine, where you could open your eyes underwater and move
around, and Radar, where you could open your eyes above water but you
couldn&rsquo;t move.  When I was It, I made it a personal challenge to
catch Rob, who&rsquo;s hair had grown out a little bit since Ft. Worth, but
somehow, I kept ending up with Nick instead. One time I
grabbed somebody and thought I had finally gotten ahold of Rob and I
was doing a victory yell, but when I opened my eyes I saw I had Mike
Moren instead.  By the way, Rob, your hair looks really cute like
that; just long enough to cover your head.  You should keep it that
length.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>We were the last ones in the pool, staying until well after dinner
had officially been served.  We all walked back to the pavilion
together and ate, and the evening was getting on when I went
swimming again at about 9 o&rsquo;clock.  Besides me and Dave in the pool,
there was also BEN Atkinson and Kim Strouble.  Later Bryan
Beck came and told me how silly I was to be in the pool with my jeans
on, but I guess my hypnotic body language had a profound effect on
him, because in a few minutes he did the same thing.  Stacy came in
for a little while, and it was about fifteen minutes before ten when
we finally left.  It was, of course, dark, and almost time for
worship to start.  At ten thirty we all walked in a line down a trail
to where the park employees had set up a big bonfire for us.  We
surrounded it in a circle, and I stood as close to it as I could
endure so my jeans would dry out.  The worship was put on by Emily
Stainer, and it was something I had never seen before which was
similar to a whispering circle, except here the emphasis was more on
touching and feeling than speaking.  It was an exercise in
unconditional love.  The circle was divided in half, and first one
side closed its eyes and the other side moved over to it while
everybody loved on and said nice things to the people with their eyes
closed, who were not allowed to respond in any way.  Then the circle
reformed and the sides switched.  My side was doing the loving first,
and I took my time and gave a warm, personalized verbal love note to
everybody I loved on, so I only got to about half of them before time
ran out.  Then I went back to my spot near the fire and tried to keep
my eyes closed while I got loved unconditionally, but I couldn&rsquo;t help
peeking a few times.  Once somebody played with my nipples, and
once somebody gave me a short, soothing backrub then stuck his
wet finger in my ear (gee, I wonder who that could have BEN?!), but
it was all friendly and pleasant.  It was over too soon, then we got
with our touch groups and each of us found a twig.  The twigs were
supposed to represent a challenge which we had either in the past,
present, or future, one we had overcome or gained ground on, or were
still fighting with.  We shared the challenge with our touch group if
we wanted, then the twigs were gathered up and tied into a bundle
which was gathered into the larger community bundle, which was thrown
into the fire and we had a long moment of silence while it burned.
Then we were asked again to share our challenges with the whole group
if we wanted.  My challenge was growing up.  That has always been my
challenge, and just recently in my life I realized it, and I have
actively been making it my goal, even though I know I&rsquo;ll never be
finished.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>Before we broke up we all got close and sang Good Friends, then when
everybody else left I stayed behind and stood close to the fire
because my pants were still wet and by sheer luck I made a new friend
in the process.  When we thought everybody else was getting ready
to leave, we walked away slowly and sat down a distance away from the
fire.  In just a couple of minutes two of the park employees walked
by us dragging a hose to put the fire out with.  They started
drenching the once-grand fire and I couldn&rsquo;t stand to look at it, so
since they couldn&rsquo;t see me I reached out and kinked the hose.  A
worthless gesture, I know, but just to mess with them I kinked it and
unkinked it several times at irregular intervals before I got up and
walked away.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>At rallies most people go through emotional phases, and this was the
time during the rally when I was a little sluggish and very patient,
when I took my time doing everything and had that wonderful, content
feeling where my heart swells up and I love everybody so much that I
would be happy no matter what was going on around me and I just want
to hug and love and linger on every person that I see.  A bad time
for this to happen, because the other people in my van were in a
hurry to leave so we could follow the caravan back to the church.  I
took my time and walked slowly getting my stuff back into the van and
we were the last ones to leave.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>As soon as I got back to the church, Dave and I had to go help
prepare the food for the Love Feast.  We cut up a watermelon which
turned out to be no good, but we had other watermelons and there
was plenty of food anyway.  My touch group prepared apples,
watermelon chunks, bananas (not the best fingerfood), cheese,
goldfish, gummi bears, M&amp;Ms, chocolate chips, baby carrots,
and crackers, and we carried them all outside to the parking lot and
got everybody together for the Love Feast. This was the first Love
Feast I actually attended, and the first one at a rally I have been
to.  It wasn&rsquo;t the best place to walk around in bare feet, especially
with the gummi bears and bananas, but I enjoyed myself still.  When
we were feeding each other a guy drove up in a BMW.  He was visiting
one of the Tulsa youth while on his way to work.  He must have been
in a hurry, because when we tried to feed him, he wouldn&rsquo;t eat
anything, and shortly he drove away very fast.  He didn&rsquo;t even stick
around long enough to meet Dave, but that was OK because Dave has a
lot of friends anyway.</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>

<p>After the Love Feast by some chance I didn&rsquo;t have to clean up, so I
went back inside and hung out in the sponge room.  Stevie Williams
gave me a wonderful picture of Dave she had drawn, which he will
cherish forever, so I asked her to draw one on the wall for everyone
else to remember him by.  I didn&rsquo;t try very hard to stay awake that
night, and I went to sleep after a while on one of the couches.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>When I woke up in the morning the lights in the sponge room were off
and I was being tormented by really terrible stomach pains, probably
because of a tray full of chocolate chips that Nick Grunewald had
poured down my gullet at the Love Feast the night before.  Before
long I was talkin&rsquo; to Ralph on the big white telephone.  After having
four distinct conversations, I clunked heavily back into the Sponge
Room, where people were now moving around getting ready, and
collapsed on the floor. Though I had bowed faithfully to the
porcelain god he had not answered my prayers and I was still very
sore.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>While I was lying on the floor in the sponge room, Jon
Witten-Lege informed me of my somnambulist activities the
night before.  According to him, I had gotten up from where I was
lying on the couch and mumbled some indecipherable sounds.  I had
walked over to where the couch right beneath the bulletin board that
said &ldquo;The Sponge Room&rdquo; sat and molested the feet of the person who
was sleeping there (I think it was Frank Roessler), possibly as an
indulgence of my foot fetish.  Then I had walked over to Jon and
mumbled some more gibberish (now that I think about it I was probably
trying to say something like, &ldquo;Ouch, my stomach&rdquo;).  He had tried in
vain to communicate with me, and then he had asked me, &ldquo;Dane, are you
asleep?&ldquo;, and I had said, &ldquo;Yyyyyeeeeeeessssss&rdquo;.  Then I had gone back
to my couch and lain down again.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>Eventually I had to get my stuff and move out to the
hallway in front of the door, because the Sponge Room was being
cleaned and it was raining outside.  I almost hurt too bad to move,
but it was fun watching while other people scurried around cleaning.<br />
I fell asleep for a little while and when I woke up I was feeling
significantly better, although whatever it was that I had is still
bothering me a little as I write this.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>Breakfast was bagels and juice, served right before closing circle.<br />
There were six seniors at the rally, and they formed a circle in the
middle and started a not-too-enthusiastic round of Good Friends,
which the rest of us joined in on.  While it was going they faced
outwards and we all did a spiral hug around them.  Then we let them
out and did the usual emotional goodbye.  Mugbooks were not given out
at the rally, because the film hadn&rsquo;t been developed in time, so they
will be mailed out later, which is something I&rsquo;ve heard about but
never experienced in two years of rally life.  So goodbye guys, love
ya, see you in New Orleans.
</p>
<p>
Yo,
Dane and Dave</p>
