                        <h1>1997 New Orleans rally review by Dane Dormio</h1>

<hr>

<p>
I have never been to the New Orleans rally before, but from what I 
have heard about it, this year's Fire-themed get-together lived up to 
the New Orleans UU church's reputation of a great rally.  This year I 
rode with my mom and brought along with me a new guy, AJ, who will be 
a fellow student with me next year at the Arkansas School for 
Mathematics and Sciences.  Dave the plunger also came along.
</p>
<p>
The drive alone took us about 8 hours, but we were held up for about 
two hours with van trouble along the way.  Nothing serious, and we 
made it the rest of the way there and back with no trouble at all.  
We forgot to bring the map to the church, so as soon as we got into 
New Orleans we stopped at a gas station and called the church, got 
its address from the answering machine, then found it not too far 
from where we were.
</p>
<p>
This rally was a lock-in, so after I got there and went inside I came 
back out and brought all my stuff in for the night.  I looked through 
all the registration forms and found out who was there, but because 
of the lateness of the hour (3:00 am) a lot of people were asleep so 
I had to wait until later that morning to see some of them.  There 
was still plenty of energy, though, and I walked into the gym to find 
a basketball game in progress.  I got my picture taken with Dave and 
Frank, then stayed up the rest of the night visiting and figuring out 
where everything was in the church.  There were about as many new 
people as there had been at Tulsa, most of them from Baton Rouge, so 
I had plenty of people to get acquainted with.
</p>
<p>
When breakfast was served I was doing something and missed it, which 
was okay because I wasn't hungry anyway.  While Nick Deveraux was 
asleep on the loveseat in the boy's sleeping room with his head 
laying back on the arm and his mouth hanging wide open, looking 
absolutely hilarious, I came in and took a picture of him.  Not much 
happened until lunch.  I greeted the people who had been asleep when 
I came in, and one time when I was standing in the hall John Thompson 
came up behind me and grabbed me, and I was very pleasantly surprised 
because I hadn't even known he was there.
</p>
<p>
Lunch was some rice stuff, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian, and 
salad.  It was pretty good and not standard rally-fare, but I don't 
know what it was called.  In retrospect it seems like there was a 
little less buzzing-type energy in the air than usual, as if people 
mostly just sat around.  One time I was sitting on a bench in the 
gym looking at some pictures from Dallas and Nick Deveraux mentioned 
that everybody was just sitting around, and he would expect me, of 
all people, to be up and doing something, so I got up and attacked 
him.  We wrestled around for a few minutes until we got hot and 
sweaty.  This was just before lunch.
</p>
<p>
Sometime after lunch and before the workshops (I think) I became part 
of a pile of bodies in the boy's sleeping room, an activity which 
deserves a name, in which we managed to fit eight people onto a 
two-person love seat all at the same time.  
</p>
<p>
I did a little nail-painting in the short amount of time before the 
workshops began.  I was given misinformation about the guided 
meditation workshop and it ended right when I thought it was supposed 
to be starting.  I went to the cookie workshop instead, and I mixed 
the ingredients while Dave supervised the goings-on.  There were two 
batches, one with huge chocolate chips and one with small chocolate 
chips.  I did the mixing of the batch with the small chips along with 
help from the others.  We got the cookies in the oven and they came 
out a little crunchy but were alright.
</p>
<p>
Shortly after the workshops was dinner, excellent microwave lasagna, 
and then after that I think was a game of silent football with Rob as 
the dictator.  I may have the order of some of these events mixed up, 
but as best as I can recall I got all the important ones.  Tony lost 
silent football, and his penance was that he had to jiggle his pecs 
on demand for the rest of the rally.  The fiesta was supposed be 
next, but it wasn't much and didn't happen until after worship.
</p>
<p>
Worship was, as promised, emotionally charged (kick-ass).  It was 
held at midnight and everyone was required to participate.  We all 
lined up in the hallway and the lights were turned off, and a few at 
a time we walked down a hall lined with candles and wrote a wish on a 
piece of paper, then washed our hands in perfumed water and dried 
them before entering a room with some candles and other things in the 
center where we made a circle around the outer edge.  While we 
were doing this we were chanting a pagan song about the elements.  
When everybody got into the room, Abby did the worship-type 
speaking, and the wishes were put into a can and burned.  Some more 
worship-type speaking, and then everybody got small birthday candles 
and passed a flame of love all the way around the circle.  The ashes 
from the burned wishes were mixed with water and smeared on the 
cheeks of all the participants, with the words "May the Spirit of 
Fire be with you".  Maiah made a joke out of this by hugging 
people while turning her cheek and saying, "Kiss my ash."  After the 
official circle broke up, most of the participants stayed in the room 
and we got very emotional.  There was a lot of crying, mostly because 
of this being the absolute last, no-more-chances, this is it, we're 
not kidding, final rally of the year.  The emotions were very strong 
and the embraces were plentiful, and the love flowed freely for a 
very long time.
</p>
<p>
Eventually the mood livened up, and the lights were turned back on, 
and we were ready for the talent show.  First up I think were Gabe 
and Mike, doing their thing one last time, and then I demonstrated 
some of the many uses and talents of Dave the plunger.  He is an 
exercise partner, a self-defense weapon, a hula-hoop expert, a 
gymnast,  a great mathematician (although he is not the best public 
speaker), he can fly short distances, with a lot of patience he can 
give a huge hickey, and a few other things that I have forgotten.  
Then I did my "Oh, What a Luxury" poem from SWUUSI last year, and 
before I quit I led the rain thing where everybody makes noises in 
unison.  Then Abby read a couple of her poems, one of which won a 
national award, and Tony did the pec thing, and I can't remember what 
the rest of the acts were.
</p>
<p>
It was three a.m. by the time the talent show was over, a little 
later than usual, so most of the people who would have gone to bed 
earlier were still up.  I was ready to start up a batch of Groovy 
Juice, which I had been planning for a while, and I had recruited 
some of the best help around, but to my dismay all the things in the 
kitchen that would have made Groovy Juice were not designated for 
YRUU use, so we couldn't use them.  I was really disappointed, 
because I was going to make a special batch and dedicate it in honor 
of Anna Magwood, who couldn't be at the rally due to cruel and unfair 
employers.  Sorry, Anna.
</p>
<p>
The fiesta happened next, and as I said before it wasn't much, just 
some pretty lights strung up around the courtyard and a little music 
and dancing.  When everybody settled down sufficiently I got enough 
people together to play Psychiatrist, which hadn't been played since 
San Antonio and was due for a go around.
</p>
<p>
I stayed up until fairly late the next morning just wandering around 
and talking, and finally fell asleep in the sanctuary shortly before 
wake-up.
</p>
<p>
When we got up in the morning I struggled to maintain an upright 
position while mopping the boy's bathroom.  When we could go outside 
I carried my stuff out to the car and waited for breakfast.  Contrary 
to the norm, it wasn't doughnuts but was the usual cereal and orange 
juice.  When it was finished and mostly cleaned up, closing circle 
gathered in the gym.  We sang Yogi Bear, the Buzzard song, the Beaver 
song, and when the six seniors who were there had their circle in the 
middle we sang Good Friends.  In an exciting burst of energy the 
seniors started Bish Bish right in the middle of a verse and I joined 
in with all my might.  Then the mugbooks were handed out and we all 
went outside, but most of the goodbyes weren't said yet.  When we 
left the majority of us went downtown to the French quarter and 
acted like tourists for about an hour.  On the way there Dave and I 
got in the back of the van and entertained Rob and his youth, who 
were driving behind us.
</p>
<p>
For most of the time I walked around the French quarter I was with 
Tia, Katie, Kitty, and AJ.  We went into several shops and Tia bought 
some beads and a black boa, kitty bought a mask and a white boa, and 
I bought a red boa to go along with the rally shirt and another 
tee-shirt that said I was a certified muff-diving instructor and had 
a big design on the back.  AJ bought one of those long skinny clamp 
things with an alligator head and a pair of black boxers with red 
peppers all over them.
</p>
<p>
We got back to where we were all supposed to meet a little earlier 
than the scheduled time, so we went into a nearby ice-cream shop and 
I shared a banana split with Tia.  About the time we were supposed to 
meet it started raining, and Gabe and Mike discovered a great 
pebble-covered sidewalk that you could run and slide a long way on, 
but my thick boots didn't do nearly as well on it as tennis shoes.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately it didn't rain for very long and we didn't get too wet.  
When we were walking back to where we had all parked Dave got 
friendly with a Lexus that pulled up to us while we were crossing a 
street.  The guy driving didn't like it too much.
</p>
<p>
We did most of our goodbyes in the parking lot, and all of the 
crying had been done the night before so they were mostly cheerful 
and happy.  When I finally got around to letting go and getting in 
the van, we drove off and the last thing I remember seeing was a 
picture-perfect memory that will probably stick in my mind as long as 
I live:  looking out the back window, I saw Gabe and Mike sitting on 
some steps just hanging out, and they looked so content in the 
perfect scenery, with the wet trees and the dim cloud darkened sky.  
There is really something special about two guys who are such good 
friends for so long.  It was a perfect way to remember the last time 
I saw them.
</p>
<p>
So another rally is ended, and another day, and another review, and 
another chapter in the book of life, and that is the way it is must 
be.  A peaceful goodbye, y'all, and see you in three weeks for 
SWUUSI.
</p>
<p>
With much Love,
</p>
<p>
Dane Allen Dormio and Dave the Plunger
