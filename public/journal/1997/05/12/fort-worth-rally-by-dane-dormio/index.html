                        <h1>1997 Ft Worth rally review by Dane Dormio</h1>

<hr>

<p>Ft. Worth, rally number eleven for me, and the last one for a lot of
seniors.  This fact perhaps made it a little more emotional than
most.  At the end, though, I was surprised that almost nobody cried.<br />
Last year, I remember, there was a lot of crying at the end.  I was
told that by the time it&rsquo;s time for seniors to leave, they are about
ready to move on anyway.  I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s true, but I&rsquo;m also sure it
is still not easy, and I definitely don&rsquo;t look forward to it.  I
think this was a good last rally, because it had so many memorable
events.  There were no wall incidents, but hey, it&rsquo;s the small things
that count.  Things like the few hours during the day that the power
went out, and the cotton down that was constantly floating around in
the air and depositing itself in places, and the wet, sandy mud on
the playground that felt wonderful on bare feet, and yes, even the
toilet in the little boys room that overflowed and the water that
spilled out into the lobby and down the ramp into the dining room.  I
hope my last rally is as nice.  At night it was cool, but not as cold
as OKC, but during the day it was sunny bright and just warm enough.
<p>
The drive was about eight hours, relatively short for us.  The usual
four from Jonesboro, Arlene, Carina, Aaron, and myself, went, as well
as Greg Williams, a guy from our fellowship, who went as an advisor.
Four weeks seemed like a long time to wait for a rally, and I was
fully ready by the time I arrived.  I hopped out of the car and
walked inside.  I signed in and was immediately greeted
enthusiastically by Rob.  (Boy, it&rsquo;s great to finally be here.  Hey,
somebody&rsquo;s charging at me.  Oh my god, it&rsquo;s Rob.  Oh my god, he&rsquo;s
bald!  Harruuumph!  Hi, Rob.)  The greetings were as exciting and
emotional as always.  I greeted everybody and checked out the
church. It was a nice place for a rally.  They hadn&rsquo;t had one in
about three years, the Duck rally, hence the name of this one, &ldquo;Son
of Duck.&rdquo;  There was a white porcelain duck on a table with markers
for people to decorate and memorabiliaize at their leisure.  Now that
I think about it, it was a minor miracle that it did not get broken.<br />
<p>
Opening Circle happened, with a rubber duckie tossed around and duck
stories shared.  The idea was to share happy stories, but the
majority of the stories told were about ducks or ducklings getting
squashed, stepped on, eaten, incinerated, falling through sewer
grates, etc.  Then afterwards touch group meetings.  I don&rsquo;t know
about the others, but mine was pretty good.  There were a lot of good
getting-to-know-each-other questions.
<p>
The first night rolled steadily on with all the usual buzzing energy:
bouncing music and Ballzacks, the Zoo game, the invention of
Deadball, a floppy boomerang being chased, and general Tiggerish
behavior.  I decided to be a wimp and laid down to watch
&ldquo;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Crow&rdquo;.  I fell asleep for
a few hours before morning.
<p>
Breakfast was the usual, cereal and milk.  The newly-risen sun was
beautiful, drying up the dewy grass and warming the sidewalks,
accompanied by pleasant birdsongs.  When morning workshop time rolled
around, I was in the movie room and since the workshop was going to
be about sexuality, I decided to stay where I was.  It was a great
workshop, put on by a woman whom I later found out was Gary Randall&rsquo;s
girlfriend.  The first thing we did was hold up various pictures and
decide how sexual they were.  It turned out, of course, that they
were all sexual, because all people are sexual.  It was a very
informative and enlightening workshop, and I learned a little more
about what it means to be a human being.  When it was over the woman
who put it on gave me a special hug and told me I had a wonderful
mind and heart, and she wanted me to know that.  Then I picked
Nick G. up and exposed his rear for free smacks, which he got a lot
of, because he had been making bad jokes the whole time.
<p>
At lunch they served sandwiches.  I fixed a couple, then sat down and
helped put together a jigsaw puzzle.
<p>
Sometime during the day, I got around to walking back out the front
door and realized something I hadn&rsquo;t in the dark:  the cotton down
that had settled all around the front door resembled duck down, which
went along perfectly with the theme of the rally.  As the day grew
older a game of ultimate frisbee started on the big grassy field, but
I did&rsquo;t participate because I didn&rsquo;t want to run around in the sun
and get all hot and smelly.  Instead I walked across to the
playground and pulled my pants up to walk around in the puddles of
water.  I swung in the tire swing, climbed the swingset, and pushed
Emily sessions and Karen Plemons around on the merry-go-round.
<p>
I was walking back to the church and saw Kitty and Ben sitting lazily
under a tree doing nothing, so I decided to help them.  The three of
us sat on a sleeping bag for at least an hour, partaking of nature.<br />
In such a manner the afternoon passed, and the afternoon workshops
came and went.  I went back to the church eventually and hung around
for a bit, then eventually wandered back to the playground before
the day was over.
<p>
Some other things I did during that day were learn how to play
deadball, sit and have a serious talk with Brian, sit and have a
serious talk with Tia, sit and have a serious talk with Anna, and I
started to mosh to &ldquo;Antichrist Superstar&rdquo; with a few other Manson
fans, but apparently even the power company dislikes Marilyn Manson,
because shortly after the CD started the power surged for a while and
then went out.  Somebody started a rumor that a squirrel had touched
two power lines and caused the surge, and Laura Moriaty spread it, so
a mob of people went outside expecting to see a fried squirrel
hanging from the power lines, only to be disappointed when they found
out that it was just a blown transformer.  The bathrooms didn&rsquo;t have
any windows, so candles were used for them, but the power came back
on before it started to get dark.
<p>
The main attraction for the evening for several people involved a
tube of blue icing that Nick G. had found earlier.  He got a group of
people together to PHUUF my sister and smeared the blue icing all
over my face.  After a little bit of &ldquo;heavy persuasion&rdquo; we got my
sister to acquiesce, and I PHUUFed her, making sure to get the icing
in good.  Then anyone who wanted to lick it off of her got a chance.<br />
I&rsquo;m sure this was just great for my sister, who had been PHUUFED in
as many ways as are conceivable already by James and Chris.  Then,
when I went into the bathroom to wash my face off, I found a flaw in
Nick&rsquo;s plan:  blue icing STAINS YOUR FACE BLUE.  It was alright,
though, it was pretty freaky looking.
<p>
Dinner was lasagna and French bread, like at OKC, but with cookies
for desert instead of brownies.  During dinner we watched the runners
for YAC give their &ldquo;elect me&rdquo; speeches.  The ones who ran were Jeremy
Loomis-Nooris, Austin Roth, Aaron Ivener, and Rob.  After that, of
course, elections.  Then touch group meetings, for which we were
supposed to get something done, but my group must have missed
something, because we didn&rsquo;t do anything at all.
<p>
At eight o&rsquo;clock, after the touch group meetings, I went into the
movie room and laid down and watched &ldquo;The Crow&rdquo; again, because I had
missed most of it last night due to being asleep.  There was
supposed to be a dance going on in the big room, and every once in a
while someone would come in and say, &ldquo;Come on guys, come dance!&rdquo;, or
something like that.  So eventually, I got up and went into the big
room and guess what:  nobody was dancing.  So everybody just hung out
in there and eventually the dance turned into speeches by the
important people, something about YAC or the bylaws and the rally
sanctioning laws, or something serious like that.  I didn&rsquo;t pay too
much attention, being busy fighting off sleep instead.
<p>
Eventually that ended and turned into a talent show, which I sat in
on but did not pay a whole lot of attention to, except when I
was requested to sing &ldquo;Dead Puppies&rdquo;, partly because of tiredness,
but later because Jessica Ford and I were busy trading back rubs.<br />
She did me, then I did her, and I had to top her back rub, so I
did her hands, arms, and feet too, so I took a lot longer.  I missed
two consecutive games of silent football in such a manner, as well as
a batch of groovy juice.  We paused shortly, though, to dance around
doing &ldquo;tu lakazia, nali pasa caya&rdquo; (spelled phonetically), for the
worship service.  I was so tired that I actually fell asleep a few
times while sitting up massaging her feet.  It was weird, I was aware
of what I was doing with my hands, but not of anything else.  A
strange ASC.  I eventually quit and walked around inside and out for
a while, trying to stay awake for a little while longer so I could
partake of a superior batch of groovy juice promised by Garrick and
Charles Misner, occasionally snacking on the Oreos that were set out.
<p>
I was overcome by sleep, however, before I could ever get so much as
a whiff of the superior batch.  I&rsquo;m not even sure if it ever
happened.  I was laying on the floor and sometime during my short
sleep I grabbed Garrick&rsquo;s overcoat and pulled it on top of me to
cover up with.  Something vibrating and buzzing in one of the pockets
woke me up with a start, and I got up shortly after that.
<p>
When I got up it was before six, but wake-up was not until seven,
so there was a while to wait before I could have my fun.  Linda
actually started waking people up at six forty-five, because once
they were up and looked at the schedule, it didn&rsquo;t matter if they
were pissed anyway.  I went around and did my share of the waking-up.
<p>
Clean up passed quickly, because I sat and snuggled with Anna the
whole time (don&rsquo;t worry, I don&rsquo;t usually shirk my duties).  Breakfast
was doughnuts, different kinds than just glazed, which is always
good.  Then closing circle out in the middle of the field.<br />
Bish-bish, yogi bear, the beaver song, I don&rsquo;t remember what else,
excellent mugbooks, and a senior circle.  A last minute plan of Nick
Devereaux&rsquo;s, the seniors all ran at Nick Grunewald and swept him up
and gang PHUUFed him before he ever knew what was happening.  I know
it just made his rally.
<p></p>

<p>Emotional goodbyes, a few teary ones, but people were alright.<br />
The advisors decided that the youth weren&rsquo;t getting out of the
church fast enough, so Rob and Debbie shoved everyone out the
door in an irresistible clump of bodies.  When I finally got finished
saying goodbye to all my friends, I decided to ride with Little Rock
to their church and then the rest of the way home with the rest of
the Jonesboroites.  The first few hours in the van with Little Rock
were pretty boring, but during the second half of the trip I taught
them all how to play Silent Football.  I was, of course, the
dictator, and they were all new, except for Nick G., who had played
the night before.  It took about an hour and half or so to get
everyone familiar with the rules, and then at least that long to play
a game.  It was a really good game, though, for being played in a
moving van with a bunch of beginners.  Nick G. lost, and for penance
everyone got to comb his hair, something he hates.
<p></p>

<p>And then we got to the church, I said goodbye, then I went home and
lived happily ever after.<br />
