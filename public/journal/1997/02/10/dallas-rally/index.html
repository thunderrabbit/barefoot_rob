                        <h1>1997 Dallas rally review by Rob</h1>

<p><p class=date>Monday 10 February 1997</p>
<font size=-1>transcribed out of my diary</font>
<p>
Dallas Rally was this past weekend.<br>
I brought Jon Whitten-Lege, Andrew L, Daniel Kamas, Cathy Saur, and Mike Noyse.
<p>
The first night after opening circle, I mostly just walked around and met and introduced a lot of youth.  I talked for a while in the sanctuary with Debe Barnes, Julie, Michelle, and Maia Cudhea about their youth group.<br>
I slept from 4am to 6am
<p>
I attended the AM workshop on Dreams and Consciousness. The dude focused a lot on physical scientific classical explanations, but we got to listen to Abby B&rsquo;s dream and analyze it.
<p>
I had a big peanut butter and strawberry jelly sandwich for lunch and attended the clay modeling workshop in the afternoon. I made Wende W an elephant salt shaker, which I hope she&rsquo;ll like. I haven&rsquo;t given it to her as it&rsquo;s not dry yet.
<p>
I helped Abby organize a game of Captain Video, where Mick (?) started us with a contortion of wrapping his hands around and over his head, which turned into a gyrating dance, pulling off a sweater ad tossing it at the viewer.  Cra Zee!
<p>
I organized a game of wink, which was painful but fun on the hard linoleum of Channing Hall. My left hip is pretty tender.
<p>
Ultimate frisbee was great fun in the YMCA field, just like 7 years ago except we had no earthball.
<p>
We played two games about 9 on 9 and then 5 on 6. A great time was had by all, I believe. I totally enjoyed being able to just run and run and run!
<p>
Muddy and tired, we drug our asses back inside where I chilled, listening to &ldquo;painful convictions&rdquo; nin CD with Tia Lawler.
<p>
Somewhere in all the Saturday activities, several of us slam danced to several obnoxious songs including &ldquo;Hey Man Nice Shot&rdquo; by Filter and &ldquo;Irresponsible Hate Anthem&rdquo; by Marilyn Manson. We threw 3 kooshes and a cloth frisbee around in Channing until it got too rowdy and Stacey H and Liz and Debe B organized a round of what we now call &ldquo;The Animal Game.&rdquo;
<p></p>

<p>In the game (in no particular order), I was kangaroo, Keith Lawler was
Giraffe, Grayson was Duck, Debe Barnes was Flamingo, Meagan Holt (?) was Chicken,
Liz was Baboon, Stacey Hendren was Dog, Suzanne Kelly was Scorpion, Kitty Rankin was
Cat, Aaron B was 3 Toed Sloth, Caroline B was Bunny, Erin B(?) was
Fish, Bryan W was Newt, and Tiffany Schneider was Pig.</p>

<p><p>
The two funniest patterns that occurred repeatedly:
<ol>
<li>Someone doing Pig, then Tiffany, in one desperate motion pressed her nose up and then made the comb of Chicken above her head.  Meagan would shriek &ldquo;stoppit!&rdquo; and make the comb and run and punch in place Kangaroo to me.</li>
<li>Keith would delightfully announce &ldquo;Giraffe! Giraffe!&rdquo; with his hand up high and wait for the person to nearly catch him before quickly grabbing his chin, &ldquo;Monkeeeeeey.&rdquo;<br>
One time I was It and the motions went to Keith so I ran over to Liz to wait for him to say Monkeeey and I tagged her an instant later.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Talent Show consisted mostly of jokes and me being the model for James Meine and Ben to put makeup on. Nutty.
<p>
At the end of worship, we sang &ldquo;Good Friends&rdquo; and spiral hugged around Abby B.
<p>
Stacey Hendren was Madame Dictator in Silent Football until 1am.  Then Zach Rutlege was dictator until he was practically falling asleep at 2am.
<p>
Slept, woke, cleaned, hugged, closing circle, donuts and more hugs.
<p>
Then Mike Noyse asked if I had seen Gabe Rendon and I sent Mike to the advisor room, and I went to the van where I found Gabe!<br>
&ldquo;Gabe!  Follow me!&rdquo; and I ran and he ran after me and we practically crashed into Mike as he was coming down the stairs.<br>
In slow motion, they tumble-fought, hugged, wrestled, punched crashing down the stairs at their last Dallas Rally.</p>

<p><p>I remember my last Dallas Rally hugs with Aaron Maxwell way back from 1990.  Aww yeah.</p>

<p><p>2:45am Monday 10 February 1997</p>
