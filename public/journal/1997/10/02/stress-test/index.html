                        <p><p>
A super funny/awesome thing just happened here at work.
<p>
I&rsquo;m writing a new application that allows users to view their
invoices and print them in either text or postscript format.
Printing the text invoices is easy; each invoice is already stored as an individual file, and I just queue it to the printer.
<p>
Because of the screwed up way we do the postscript invoices, I have to extract from a huge file of invoices the individual postscript invoice, write it to a file, print that file and then delete the file.  Fine.
<p>
The current application that my code is replacing will break if you print three postscript invoices in quick succession. I made sure my code would not have that problem, but I didn&rsquo;t really want to test that because it would waste a lot of paper.
<p>
Today I made some modifications to my code to nicely display error messages to the user. So I&rsquo;m testing my code and purposely defined a logical incorrectly so it couldn&rsquo;t print. Each time I pressed &lsquo;P&rsquo;, it would say, &ldquo;cannot create file BLAHBLAHBLAHn. Call Customer Service&rdquo; or something like that.  The n was a number that was incremented each time &lsquo;P&rsquo; was pressed.
(for those technically inclined, this was simply to give each file a unique name). I held down &lsquo;P&rsquo; and watched the number happily increase with each failed attempt to create the file.
To test the robustness of my program, I used my phone receiver to hold down the &lsquo;P&rsquo; key. It had counted up to 2000 when I left to go talk to Pam.
<p>
I showed Pam my new error message setup&ndash; how it was much more user friendly and informative. To show her how it could handle three invoices being printed at time, I fixed the logical and hit &lsquo;P&rsquo; three times in a row. We went to the printer and waited for them to come up (had to put more paper in the printer tray) and it printed all three. No sweat. Yay!
<p>
Came back to my cube and my computer was having a heart attack! Beepbeepbeepbeepbeepbeep incessant beepbeepbeepbeep!!!!  What the heck??? It&rsquo;s printing!!  I ran over to the printer queue and it had printed about 20 invoices, and was still going. <em>Shit!</em> I paused the printer and came back to see what happened. I checked the printer queue and there were <strong>hundreds</strong> of identical jobs ready to print!  Ack!!!
<p>
I called Systems Management and had them kill the entire queue and recreate it. They did, and problem solved. But what had happened???
<p>
When I was at Pam&rsquo;s desk, and fixed the logical, my computer was able to successfully create the files! It had created and queued 750+ files in about 5 minutes! Yay!!! My program blows away the current program!! Inadvertant stress testing, and my code passed with no problem.
