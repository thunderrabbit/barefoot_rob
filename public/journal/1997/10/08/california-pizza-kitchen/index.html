<p><p>
Tonight we had super great fun at California Pizza Kitchen! In this case, we = Wende W, Jon W, kT H, Laura M, Dennis ?, Paul R, and me Rob N. This was the first of at least 2 Wednesday night LRY outings. Wende and I told the youth that she and I will go eat at CPK, and if they wanna show up, that would be great!
<p>
Heidi, our waitress, joked a lot, making references to our invisible friends before everyone had arrived. When she came back with our water, I said, &ldquo;Yay!&rdquo; and she teased, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s only water.&rdquo;
That was funny. I kept saying &ldquo;Yay!&rdquo; each time she refilled my glass.
<p>
Jon and I sat at one end of the table and talked about the existence of non-physical beings called Allies. All the stuff he described to me that he had figured out for himself matched quite well with what I had read in the book <em>Bringers of the Dawn</em> by Barbara Marciniak. (This is the third time that Jon has told me stuff he has figured out himself without knowing I had read it in a book somewhere. Amazing!)
<p>
The other portion of the table mostly talked amongst themselves, though I kept an ear listening to them as well. Paul participated in both conversations.
<p>
kT and I made several comments about what Annie likes. Annie is a friend of ours (who we&rsquo;ve never met); Annie likes some things and doesn&rsquo;t like others. The trick is to figure out the pattern of things that she does or does not like. Wende gets so frustrated when we play!
<p>
We had a fun night, though a bit expensive, so we probably won&rsquo;t eat there again next week. We will keep lookin&rsquo; around to find just the perfect spot for our weekly friendly gatherings.
