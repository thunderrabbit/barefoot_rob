                        <p class=date>1 March 1997</p>

<p>Last night I skated hard for the first time in a long time.  It had been since
Thanksgiving of last year, so my endurance was low.  But I still had fun.</p>

<p>I started from my apartment, skating down the street to where it's all under
construction.  Watching traffic patterns carefully, calculating trajectories
and the reactions of drivers, I rolled smoothly between the barrels and 
between the cars, then accelerated toward oncoming traffic in a blocked-off
section of street.  I slowed a bit to let the last of a wave of cars veer left
out of my way, then shot out into the street pushing hard toward the next 
intersection which held back the next wave of cars.  I did not quite make it
to the gap in the median before they came, so I had to squeeze myself between
the oncoming cars and the curb for just a *second* before I reached the
opening in the median for me to cross the street.  Looking behind me I noted
the cars had just been let across the intersection from which I just came.
I pushed harder and made my right turn at the second intersection before they
reached me.  Success.</p>

<p>I relatively leisurely skated down Dallas Street, catching my breath, and
wondering if Allen Parkway would be blocked off yet for the street festival to
be held there the next day.   I reached Taft and turned left toward Allen 
Parkway.</p>

<p>The hill leading down to Allen Parkway on Taft is a pretty fun one to skate.
Taft goes down the hill, stopping at Allen Parkway to form a T intersection.
The traffic going from right to left on Allen Parkway never has to stop at this
intersection, so even if you time the light correctly, there still is traffic 
to navigate.</p>

<p>This time, I start at the top of the hill, push push push push push push down
down faster faster faster, watching the light for cross traffic turn yellow
then red, and then green light for me (yay!) as I fly into the intersection, 
up onto the median for an instant before I cross the nonstop flow of traffic 
and see there's only one car and plenty of room so I fly off the curb, cross 
the street (watch the light post) up the curb, cut my turn harder to keep 
from tumbling over the guard rail into the ravine.  Made it.  
Perfect.</p>

<p>Skated slowly up the sidewalk/trail along Allen Parkway till I reached downtown
Houston.</p>

<p>Turned left on some street, went a ways then left on another street which I
knew would take me down toward the other side of Allen Parkway.  The light was
holding back the cars that wanted to use my same hill, so I glanced at their
headlights as if to say, "excuse me; I'll just be a second," and took off down
the hill before them.  There is no tricky intersection at the bottom, and the
light god held the cars back for more than necessary, so I easily was off the
street and headed back up the hill before the cars even got to the bottom.</p>

<p>Up through what we call Coyote Park, I skated to the top of the hill and lay 
down beneath the bronze coyote which is pictured on the front of the Houston
A-L Yellow Pages phone directory (good till September 1997) and rested.</p>

<p>Skated twice down the hill at Jones Plaza, once with some traffic, and once
without, but it wasn't nearly as good as some of my previous adrenaline trips
down that hill (see 
<a href=/skate/skate20.html>Wild Skating Adventure Twenty</a>
for a brief description).</p>

<p>Skated around a bit, but I didn't really see any other skaters.
I went up to the University of Houston Downtown campus, to skate down one of 
my favorite hills in Houston.  At the top, I skated inside the campus building
for a while, got something to drink, talked to a few students.  I even found
a night club/bar kinda place where there were two guys doing a stand up comedy
routine.  Cool!</p>

<p>I tried flirting with the girl selling tickets to get in free, but she resisted
pretty well.  The manager came up and said I would have to take my skates off
to come inside anyway, so I left.</p>

<p>Back outside to the top of the hill, I waited for the light to turn
red at the bottom.  I counted 10 seconds (while some cars went by
before me) and then took off toward the bottom.  Push push push push
avoid the groove-of-death (<a href=/skate/skate10.html>Wild Skating
Adventure Ten</a>), light turns green, fly through the intersection
yahoooo what a rush!</p>

<p>Slowly skated around the block and back to UH Downtown and called Wende, my 
girlfriend, who I knew was working there in the bookstore.  I ate M&amp;Ms, read
<i>Beavis and Butt-Head do Hollywood</i>, and then we went home.</p>
