                        <p class=date>13 March 1997</p>

<p>I just got back from my latest Wild Skating Adventure.</p>

<p>Starting from my apartment, I skated over to Empire Cafe' to meet Diane, one
of my skater buds.  We chatted for a bit while I got some water and then she
got on her skates and we went.  We did not really have a destination in mind
except maybe to skate along Fannin street to find some lilies for Wende, who
is returning tomorrow at 9am from Hawaii!  (I'm totally excited about that.)</p>

<p>Diane and I went down a street called Hazard, which is actually quite a nice
smoothly paved asphalt street.  Toward Hermann Park we skated, and rested at
a cool fountain surrounded by a ring of Roman column looking things.  I went
flying around the fountain, working hard to stay on the ring of steps, and I
found that the columns alternately blocked and allowed the sound of splashes
to reach my ears, causing a cool audio effect that reminded me of some song.</p>

<p>We rested there for a while, then skated toward the Medical Center.  The
coolest thing was being essentially right underneath the Life Flight helicopter
as it took off, blowing leaves and dust everywhere!  We skated a bit down 
Fannin, while I swerved around the various obstacles in the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Then to Rice University, where we skated up into the stadium.  Diane took off
her skates and ran the bleachers and around the field while I skated around to
the other side of the stadium to find out why I heard people cheering over 
there, but could see no lights.</p>

<p>I found people yelling encouraging cheers to some bicyclists, who were possibly
practicing for some marathon.  The track was lit with headlights of cars aimed
along the track in the direction they were biking.  Pretty cool.  It made me
nostalgic for my college days.<p>

<p>Back around to the other side, where Diane was just putting on her skates after
running the length of the field and around the track 3 times or so.  Wow.
I decided it would be a good idea to skate down the steps to the field and then
run up the steps.  I found it was not a good idea to skate down, so I carefully
walked down, sometimes waving my arms wildly to stay balanced.  
Made it to the bottom and then ran up clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk
all the way to the top without missing a beat (or a step).  That was cool.</p>

<p>We watched some guys practice hitting some baseballs in a batting net (like a 
batting cage, except it's a net) for a while and then cruised.</p>

<p>Rolled around the super smooth asphalt parking lot and then decided it was
about time to get back.  On the way back, however (still well within Rice
campus), a Bronco or Blazer or something drove by with about 20 people piled
into it.  Wow.  They drove past us- and had about a 150 foot lead on me
(plus 15 miles per hour) when I decided to catch them.  I just took off- 
skated as fast as I could for probably a bit over 100 yards.  I honestly
wouldn't have caught them except that they stopped for the stop sign.
Woah- I had trouble stopping quite in time; I ended up beside the truck.
As they drove off, I latched onto the back, in which were sitting four people
crammed side by side.   I was fully out of breath, unable to say anything like,
"HI!  I'm Rob.  I like to skate."  They pretty much didn't say anything either,
just snickered at a crazy skater who would latch onto their truck for no
reason.  The driver smiled and waved at me in the mirror, and just continued
on as if I weren't there.   They pulled me all the way to the stadium and I
let go just as they turned to where it got really rocky and wet.  "See ya
later!" I called, thinking that was a silly thing to say.</p>

<p>Still totally winded, I headed back toward where I had left Diane with 
essentially no warning.  She had skated about a third of the way I had been 
pulled when I met up with her.  Still totally winded, I said, "I had to do
that.  Thank you."</p>

<p>We cruised back toward Empire Cafe, by way of Hazard most of the way.  Diane
offered to drive me home, but I felt like I wanted to skate.  I'm glad I did
because as I skated by the people chillin' outside, Eric saw me and said HI.
The crazy thing is that Eric is the guy who owned the ramp that I jumped and
busted my head without a helmet.  Wow!  It's been probably a year since I had
seen him, and I actually didn't remember at first who he was.   (See <a href="/skate/skate06.html">Wild 
Skating Adventure Six</a>, which describes that accident.)   I continued on my
way and saw John, who owns the Montrose Skate Shop, where I buy all my skating
equipment!  I said HI to him for a bit and then continued on.</p>

<p>I had a brief non-contact interaction with a car that turned where I didn't
expect, so I cranked a turn out into the street to avoid him as he locked
his brakes.  Fortunately the street was pretty much empty, and I just skated 
across the street and up the curb to a parking lot.  No problem.</p>

<p>Skated the rest of the way home and here I am.</p>
