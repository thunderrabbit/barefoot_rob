                        <p class=date>12 December 1997</p>

<p><p>
Today I looked at a used Toyota Camry for purchase.  After talking to
the guy, my gut reaction said, &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; although the two front CV joints
needed replacing.  He said he&rsquo;d do it for me and keep the price under
$5000 including TT&amp;L.
<p>
Fine.  As I walked back to my car to get my planner, I flipped a coin,
thinking &ldquo;heads means I buy it, tails means I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;  It was tails.
<p>
But my gut still said yes, so I wrote him a $100 check to hold it for
me until tomorrow AM.
<p>
I got home and consulted Wende&rsquo;s Tarot deck and my Runes.
<p>
I don&rsquo;t know much about Tarot, so I shuffled the cards and chose four cards, giving a meaning to each one.
&ldquo;This describes his conscious&rdquo;  &ldquo;This describes his honesty&rdquo;  &ldquo;This describes the car&rdquo;  &ldquo;This tells whether I buy it or not&rdquo;
<p>
The cards came up Six of Rods, Nine of Pentacles reversed, VI The Lovers reversed, and Page of Rods reversed.
<p>
His conscious:  &ldquo;Conquest.  Triumph. Good News. Gain. Advancement.  Expectation.  Desires realized as a result of efforts.&rdquo;
<br>
His honesty: &ldquo;Threat to safety.  Roguery. Danger. Storms. Bad Faith. Possible loss of valued friendship or treasured possessions.&rdquo;
<br>
The car: &ldquo;Failure to meet the test. Unreliability. Separation.  Frustration in love &amp; marriage. Interference by others. Fickleness. Untrustworthiness. Unwise plans.&rdquo;
<br>
Do I buy it: &ldquo;Indecision in proceeding.  Reluctance. Instability. Inability to make decisions. A gossip. Bearer of bad tidings. A person who may break your heart. Displeasure.&rdquo;
<p>
That seems pretty clearly to me that I shouldn&rsquo;t buy it.  But I still wanted to check my runes:
<p>
For the overview of the situation I chose <em>Kano Reversed</em>:<br>
Expect a darkening of the light in some situation or relationship.<br>
It calls for developing inner stability, and carries the warning not to be seduced by the momentum of old ways while waiting for the new to become illuminated in their proper time.
<p>
For the challenge at hand I chose <em>Othila Reversed</em>:<br>
This is not a time to be bound by old conditioning, old authority.<br>
Adaptability and skillful means are the methods to cultivate at this time.  And still you must wait for the universe to act. <em>We do without doing and everything gets done.</em>
<p>
For the timely action I chose <em>Berkana</em>:<br>
Bekana is concerned with the flow of beings into their new forms.  Its action is gentle, penetrating and pervasive.
<p>
Well <em>that</em> seemed clear enough.  But I wanted to choose one more.  Just one more rune to get an overview of the situation.<br>
I almost just reached into the bag and grabbed another.  My intuition said, &ldquo;put the other three back in the bag.&rdquo;  So I put the three back in the bag and mixed them all up.<br />
<p>
I intended, &ldquo;the Rune I choose is an overview of the situation.  Upright means maybe still get the car, Reversed means no way.&rdquo;
<p>
I selected <em>Berkana Reversed</em>:<br>
You may be required to cultivate the soil once again, yet through correct preparation, growth is assured.
<p>
Wow.  Such incredibly specific answers from Runes and Tarot!!!!!
