                        <h1>1997  Little Rock rally review by Cathy</h1>

<hr>

<p><p></p>

<p>woke up and went to lamar with my mom to get my college day shit out of
the way; wrote a review of scrooge for my brother, and bitched at my boss
for scheduling me to work sunday.  rode to houston, cruzed rob&rsquo;s &lsquo;hood
with my parents waiting for him to get home; got to his house and saw ROB
IN PANTS!  scary.  then he immediately changed into shorts (he&rsquo;s rob
isn&rsquo;t he?)
<p>
then we went to rob&rsquo;s workplace to drop off his computer.  i waited in
the car.  Isn&rsquo;t it scary to think about rob working all day??  then we
went to taco cabana and ate and then we went to emerson to pick up KT.
then we started on the road and of course rob got us in one of his
wonderful/amazing/deep conversations.  the subject of this one was
emotions.   we kept riding and then we stopped at a gas station and i&rsquo;m
all &ldquo;um rob&ndash;i know this is a no smoking rally but what about now??&rdquo;  so
i smoked and ate chocolate and then we kept on riding sooooo long.  then
we stopped at another very strange gas station/convenience
store/restaurant/i dunno animal trophy display.  there were deer heads
everywhere and there was also a live snake, a huge snake.  weird.  then
we rode some more then we <em>finally</em> got there.
<p>
i walked up and saw carina!  what a surprise!  then i came in and saw
susanne and aaron and tiffany.  yay.  everyone was really laid back
though.  then all of a sudden a maia and a jeremy were running at me with
open arms (maia later told me that her and jeremy were sitting and jeremy
was like &ldquo;houston needs to get here&rdquo; and maia said &ldquo;check the door&rdquo; and
me and rob and kt were there. more proof that maia truly is the bomb).
then i was being hugged from behind by an unknown person who turned out
to be austin.  yay.  then me and austin and maia and jeremy did this 4
person hug for a good while.  then max and nancy got there double yay.
then i saw arlene!  yay yay yay.<br />
<p>
man what else?  opening circle.  then everyone awake started playing mau
or however you spell it and me and nancy were like that sucks so we
started sliding around on the floor in our socks and nancy fell down.  it
was so very funny.  :-)
<p>
um what else.  hung out with everyone.  like everyone was sleeping on the
Friday night!  what the fuck?? i think me and jeremy were the only ones
who stayed up the whole time.  nancy stayed awake most of the time.  in
the morning me and jeremy and nancy went outside to watch the sun rise.
then, when everyone was sleeping me and jeremy and nancy were being very
evil.  we found some big ass bubble wrap in the kitchen and started
popping it really loudly in the sanctuary where everyone was sleeping.
they weren&rsquo;t exactly happy with us.  then i lay down in the hall with
jeremy and melissa and nancy.  oh my god&ndash;me and jeremy wrapped melissa
up in her sleeping bag and like folded her body over and she looked like
a little baby.  so cute/funny!  breakfast was good; we got to see all
those silly people who slept.  we were making fun of austin for eating
cookies in his cereal.  what a weirdo.<br />
<p>
then me and jeremy and rob and nancy and max and bunch of other people
played assassin.  it was great fun.<br />
<p>
hmm&hellip; what did we do after that??  lunch i guess.  sandwiches with cool
bread and stuff.<br />
<p>
later we danced in the sanctuary and tried to play seasame street but we
just couldn&rsquo;t do it without nathan.
<p>
then massage workshop started in there (ew..yucky) so i slept in a big
puppy pile on jeremy&rsquo;s stomach who was on susanne who was on aaron who
melissa was on and tiffany and fricke were in there somewhere too,
probably some other people too, who knows?  yac meeting started so it was
just me and tiffany and susanne left to sleep in one sleeping bag
(um-against the rules)
<p>
saturday night we had dinner.  it was in little rock tradition with it&rsquo;s
courses and being served and all.  sheri-ann was there and she served us
macaroni.  yay.<br />
<p>
i spent a lot of saturday night (and the rally on a whole) hanging out
with tiffany.  that was awesome &lsquo;cause we really bonded.  we talked about
lots of stuff and just got to know each other better; it was great.<br />
<p>
me and nancy and chris anderson and tia had fun yelling things into
chris&rsquo;s fine ass laptop which he brought along to do a paper and
recording them.  (that sentence was a mastery of grammar).  then austin
and tiffany came over and told us weird stories about working for erick
and stuff.<br />
<p>
stayed up &lsquo;til 3:30 with tiffany and then we decided to sleep but chris
was using my sleeping bag as a pillow so i didn&rsquo;t want to wake him up so
i ganked somebody else&rsquo;s sleeping bag and went to sleep.  then i was
awakened by the owner of this sleeping bag standing over my head.  so i
relinquished this sleeping bag and gently picked chris&rsquo;s head up and took
my sleeping bag and replacing chris&rsquo;s pillow with someone else&rsquo;s sleeping
bag.  hey&ndash;your stuff, my stuff doesn&rsquo;t matter-it&rsquo;s rally love.
<p>
then we had to wake up yucky.
<p>
and we ate bagels and had closing circle and rob is all &ldquo;we&rsquo;re staying
for the service&rdquo;  kick ass. so i got to hang out so much longer with
tiffany and susanne and melissa and nancy and max and jeremy and aaron
and meghan.  but sadly jeremy had to go (not without getting a big hicky
from aaron first) and then max and nancy had to go.  so me and tiffany
and susanne and meghan hung out some more.  we started discussing
tattoos.  they made me pull down my pants and show them mine again. <br>
crazy monkeys.
<p>
then we stayed for the service which was wonderful and the greatest thing
about it was,  marc is giving his sermon, dressed all nice and yet there
is a little piece of glitter on his face.  :-)
then the last hymn was about dancing so everyone started dancing and
gavin and his incredibly cute self was dancing with a woman from the
little rock congregation.<br />
<p>
we started to leave but okc kept trying to kidnap me.  but then we went
20 miles out of our way to eat at subway with okc.  that was great.<br />
<p>
then we started on our loooooong drive home and created a &ldquo;read all the
signs on the road&rdquo; game.  rob played with us for a good while until he
started swerving for paying too much attention to the road sign and not
enough to the actual road.  then we added the word &ldquo;bitch&rdquo; or &ldquo;bitch
mother fucking bitch&rdquo; to the ends of signs we saw too much.  so this is
what it sounded like for an hour:  &ldquo;dot dot dot dot dot dot Willis 45
Exit 101 Mile 101 South Interstate 45 bitch mother fucking bitch dot dot
dot dot dot exit 102 move your ass 16 feet 12 inches bitch watch for ice
on bridge bitch mother fucking bitch.&rdquo;  very funny and actually quite
entertaining.
<p>
finally we got back to rob&rsquo;s apartment and all sat around being grumpy
and tired.  and then i still had to ride all the way back to beaumont
with my dad.  so i didn&rsquo;t get in my bed &lsquo;till 1:30 and then school the
next day!  aaa!! soooooo worth it though!
<p>
i love you all!<br>
cathy<br></p>
