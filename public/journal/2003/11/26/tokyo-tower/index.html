                        <p class=date>10:40pm JST Wednesday 26 November 2003</p>

<p>Had big fun hanging with Naomi after visiting Tokyo Tower.  She is
  an elevator operator there, which incluldes not only operating
  elevators, but today, greeting people at the top of the tower and
  asking them to step to the right out of the elevator.  I was like,
  "Hi Naomi"  when she saw me.</p>

<p>Because she works there, we got to visit the mystery art place free
  of charge, and she took picture with her disposable camera.  They
  were like optical illusiuory pictures with varying degrees of
  illusionicity.</p>

<p>She showed me a lot of different uildings at the top of  from the
  top of the tower and then we went to the illusion place and then
  rocked out of there in search of food.  Got two guitar pins for
  Bryn at Hard Rock Cafe (one 50% off from early 2003 and one this
  year for Christmas 2003 (city included, year included)  and then we
  stopped in a bookstore where I saw a translated version of a book
  called <em>Alice in Wonderland and the disaster at   World Trade
  Center Disaster: Why the official story of 9/11 is a monumental
  lie</em> and sent to janette via email (via my phone!!) the
  title..  I have no idea if it's a good book or not.</p>

<p>Then we chowed at an upscale Denny's calibre restaurnat and I
  didn't feel the least bit like I didn't know how to act in a
  Japanese restaurnat cuase we were cutting up and doing (subtle) see
  food games and such.  First ime in Japan for me for that.  yaya!</p>

<p>Um, then we oh, we went to a game center and took funny pictures
  in the picture booth; that I think I'll put online, but I might
  have to in a super secret place  - heck I dunno  Oh, I can put them
  on my bbst.  money.</p>

<p>UmmmmmmmmThen we headed home and I dropped her off (we rode the
  train, but) at Kawasaki, and now I'm on the Nambu line to head home.</p>

<p>Tons of fun and tons of Japanese including but not limited to:</p>

<p>wats</p>

<p>watashi no ie wa tsunashima eki aruite 8fun kurai desu</p>

<pre>
kono densha wa atono densha chisai risomething des
this is not in ps I think
 those were the most valuable ones that I remember.

oh also wakata oiete kudasai.  I think that's right.  good stuff mate.

oh and shimarimas and  m  the opposit  hirakimas I think.

There is a guy on this train bein g super loud and drunk I assume,
but he's with his friends and they are all shhh ing him to nlow
avail.   the women in front of my are gossipping quietly andmi
including lots of neeeeee annd unnnn   and neeeee  and  nnnnnnnn  and
such.  funny, but normal for them.

normal for them, but natural for me.


okay I hope nothing else super noteworthy happens or that I get homne
quickly; I'm closing my computer now and it doesn't hink it has
enough power to start back up again without a recharge.

<p>I typed a lot of this with the screen off, and then I never
  checked it.  I'm still going to post it; I'm too tired to futz with
  it now and I dunno if I'll ever edit it.</p>
