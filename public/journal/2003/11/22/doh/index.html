                        <p class=date>8:34pm JST Saturday 22 November 2003</p>

<p>Oh man.  I just met Nami to get the tix to her thingy on the 24th,
  and we were chowing noodles (makes it sound asian, but it was
  spaghetti) and then she's like blah blah blah and I'm like blah
  blah wtf?  And it starts at 5pm, but I don't get off work on Monday
  until 5:40pm!</p>

<p>Nightmare!</p>

<p>So I was like, all fracked up about that and stuff, but she was
  like, "'s cool, bro," but it really wasn't, so I texted Carla who
  can't work for me, but suggested Morag, and I called her, but it
  was busy and finally I was like, <em>okay, let it go</em> and
  continued noodle chowing.</p>

<p>Then soon as I was like, "aight bye" to Nami at Ω¬√´ station, I
  texted Morag and then called her and she called me back while I was
  chillin' on the train before we left the station (during the first
  paragraph above).  She said "no problem," she can work for me, and
  because of Nova's accounting rules (and I know how much I'm not
  impressed with their accounting (fuckin' hell, as I think about it
  I'm even *less* impressed, and will absolutely argue this point all
  the way up to Neil if they don't let us do the swap adross the
  month boundary) in that the scheduling and accounting
  databases/departments are completely separate) they will say we
  have to do the swap within the same month, which leaves only
  Wednesday as an option, which means I'd have to (*) work this
  Wednesday for her, and therefore reschedule going to Tokyo tower to
  hang out with Naomii.</p>

<p>(*) This is when Morag called me back to say she might *not* be
  able to work for me; she has a previous engagement that she doesn't
  know if she can switch or not.</p>

<p>(BUT (!) ), the good thing is that I'm not going crazy; Nami never
  emailed me that it starts at five.  We both *assumed* whatever we
  assumed about the timing (she assumed I have the day off (it's a
  National holiday), but we Nova teachers don't get shit off for
  holidays (except the days around New Years when the whole country
  shuts down) and I assumed it started later in the evening), but that
  is a different issue.</p>

<p>ps: OS X *really* chews through battery like nothin'.</p>
