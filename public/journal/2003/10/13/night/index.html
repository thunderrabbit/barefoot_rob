<p>No fruit on the perl tree, but as of tonight, I'm published on
rcdb.com!  I took the 3rd and 4th pics for <a
href="https://www.rcdb.com/installationgallery1193.htm">Hamu-Hamu
Ouku</a>.</p>

<p>After the quick response by Duane of rcdb, I sent him a couple more
pics (of Fujiyama) and have decided to zoom to Yomiuriland on
Wednesday to check out <a
href="https://www.rcdb.com/installationgallery1218.htm?Picture=1">Bandit</a>,
which appears to be a pretty rockin' coaster!</p>

<p>I'll take some super high quality pics of stuff there and will be
able to use that in my book.  Sweet!</p>

<p>Okay. bed bed bedtime.</p>

<p>Got to be up in not so long to attend Japanese class.</p>

<p>I have 1013 yen to last through tomorrow.</p>

WELL, I GO TO CLASS ON WED AND MY MICRO ECON TEACHER WAS ALL &ldquo;I AM SO SORRY I HAD TO MISS CLASS ON MONDAY, SOMETHING CAME UP AND I HAD TO GO OUT OF TOWN, SOOOOOO SORRY&rdquo;<br>
<br>
