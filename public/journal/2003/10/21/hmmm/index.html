<p>Okay.   I've just been chillin' and realized the following things:</p>

<p>I'm not really happy in Japan.</p>

<p>I could be playing/working with janette all the time instead.</p>

<p>I would miss people here.</p>

<p>Would I?  True friends will last no matter what.</p>

<p>I could blow this popsicle stand (who coined that) and work with
janette and sell art and read to her in bed</p>

<p>Why am I here?</p>

<p>There's a fear that if I leave here, I won't be able to come back.</p>

<p>Shit has got to get happier here or I'm leaving.</p>

<p>I can change my situation (housing, job), or change my attitude
(release the pressure to learn Japanese)</p>

<p>What about taking pictures of all the coasters in Japan?</p>

<p>Need piles of fat cash to do that.   (this is an assumption; I
haven't looked into it really)</p>

<p>Often I try to do everything alone (even though my greatest fear is
being alone).   I wonder why this is.   I wonder if they're inexorably
intertwined.</p>

<p>I'm going to meet Cory to go skate in 27 minutes.</p>

<br>Hey, Rob,<br>
<br>
I do hope you&rsquo;ll stay long enough for our visit! I know you&rsquo;re frustrated and unhappy, but what happened to the zen approach&ndash;settling into the moment and observing people as they are. You are getting an incredible education. I&rsquo;m proud of you. But if you come back early, I&rsquo;ll still love you!<br>
<br>
Wow&ndash;I just looked it up, thinking we&rsquo;ll be there in 3 weeks, but it&rsquo;s only 18 days! <br>
<br>
This evening I&rsquo;ll be talking to the Bay Area Search Committee. They have just received a list of five ministers who have indicated interest in coming to Bay Area. My job is to go through the process of evaluating and selecting pre-candidates and a final candidate to present to the congregation. This is their second year of search.<br>
<br>
I started water aerobics twice a week for the month of October. It&rsquo;s actually a good workout. If I keep going, I may switch to Monday and Wednesday, then go to the other side of the Y on Friday for treadmill and the machine circuit. Before October I had been doing that 3 times a week (most weeks).<br>
<br>
Haven&rsquo;t heard from Fred in a while. I guess he&rsquo;s been busy with school.<br>
<br>
Last week I was in Essex, MA, 30 miles north of Boston for the UUMA Exec fall meeting. Looooonnnnggg meetings 9-5 for 3 days plus 2 travel days. In January we go to Santa Fe, in April to Portland, OR, and in June (before GA) to Long Beach, CA. It&rsquo;s amazing how many issues they deal with on behalf of all UU ministers.<br>
<br>
YARN had its one night retreat Oct. 3-4. I think there were 8 of us and we had a good time. Next spring they want to make it 2 nights, using a 3-day weekend when they&rsquo;re out of work and school.<br>
<br>
Madeleine is coming to Austin for a visit this weekend! Jon is actually replacing the bathroom sink and vanity upstairs before then. Eventually you&rsquo;ll get to use it on a visit!<br>
<br>
Lots of love,<br>
<br>
Ma</p>
