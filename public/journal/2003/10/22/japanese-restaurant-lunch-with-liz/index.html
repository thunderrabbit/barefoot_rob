                        <p class=date>5:27pm JST Wednesday 22 October 2003</p>

<p>Didn't go to Hakkejima Seaside Paradise because it rained pretty
much all day.  Did however get a call from Liz and went to a
restaurant with her.</p>

<p>Things to remember, most of which were awesome:</p>

<p><ul>
<li><p>Car navigation with various convenience store locations
projected on the map</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>When the put the car into reverse to park, the navigation
turned into a screen displaying what was behind her! Little camera on
the back of the van shows what&rsquo;s going on back there and the predicted
direction (depending on how the wheels are aligned) was projected on
the screen!!</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>When she turned the car off, the sideview mirrors folded in
automatically! (to conserve space and keep from getting
banged)</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>Nice restaurant and when we arrived, we took off our shoes at
the door (this isn&rsquo;t done everywhere in Japan).  Our shoes were the
only shoes there. (but we were not the only customers)</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>The entire restaurant had tatami flooring.  2.5 foot squares
all over the place.  Fun to pad around on that in socks</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>Liz asked the staff to ask me all the questions so I could have
practice with listening and responding to/in Japanese.  I could hear
parts of what they said, but not really enough to do more than request
a non smoking area for two.</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>Because I tried so valiantly to speak Japanese, and this was
like a training for me, they put us in our own room designed for four
people.  One table in the room and sliding paper door.  Sliding paper
windowscreen to reveal a (small!) rock garden with bamboo in
pots</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>I got to ask the waitress what she recommended,
&ldquo;isosomenandeska?&rdquo;  (I think), and I got to try some new
foods</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>We ended up with a spread of different dishes, mostly in bowls
and a couple in plates.  One of her dishes was served in a miniature
wooden chest with three ceramic drawers.  How Japanese is that??  (I
woulda taken a picture, but I didn&rsquo;t have my camera.)</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>One of my dishes was served with a fire underneath it, and
another one was served in a bamboo box, all the pieces of which came
apart for cleaning.</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>Most of the food was soft and bland, but a couple had flavor.
I&rsquo;d never had tofu as soft as this; it was like fresh
pudding.</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>I got to help her with ideas for her 14-15 year old exchange
student, telling her what to likely expect from that age.  I hope it
proves helpful.  I&rsquo;m glad I was able to offer some insights.</p></li>
