<p>The statue of the Buddha Rushana in the Great Buddha Hall of the
Todaiji Temple is the largest bronze statue in the world and it was
completed in 749 A.D. In the year 743 the Emperor Shomu ordered the
construction ofa larg statue of the Buddha Rushana and work proceeded
under the direcdtioin of Kuninaka no Muraji Kimimaro.  Eight casting
over a period of three years and the work of large numbers of
craftsmen and artisans were neededbefore the statue was finally
complete.</p>

<p>The statue stands fifteen meters in height and all the scientific
knowledge available in eight-century Japan was required for its
successful completion.   It is recorded that the following amounts
of metal were used:</p>

<pre>
copper       500 tons
tin          8.5 tons
mercury      2.5 tons
gold         440 kilograms
</pre>

<p>Up until this time the gold used in the gold-plating of Buddhist
statue had come from the continental mainland, but in 749 gold was
found in northern Japan and then later in what is now Shizuoka
Prefecture.  Work on gilding the statue began in 752, the year in
which the dedicatory ceremonies were held, and it continued for about
five years.   The ceremonies were attended by the Empress Koken and
the ex-Emperor Shomu, who had retired in 749, and more than ten
thousand priests and musicians from Inida, China and Korea as well as
Japan took part.</p>

<p>In 1180 and again in 1567 the Great Buddha Hall was twice burnt
down in times of war and the present statue was recast in 1691, but it
ws not replated with gold.  The twenty-eight lotus petals on the
pedastal and their line engravings give the best impression of the
origianl appearance of the statue.</p>

<p>The Buddha Rushana, or Vairocana, is the Master Teacher of the
doctrines of the Kegon-Kyo, aor Avatamsaka Sutra.  This sutra is held
to give a truly faithful account of the moment and nature of Buddha's
Enlightenment and it is filled with a freshness and immediacy rarely
to be found in other sutras.  It depics the Universe known as the
Lotus World, so called because the lotus flower, which rises above te
mode in which the plant gorws, is used as a symbol of
Engliishtenment.  The view of the world which it presents is the at of
the doctrine of dependent origination, or in Sanskrit
pratityasamutpada, which holds that each and every constituent nad in
habitant of this world is connected to all others in relationships of
mutual dependence and complementarity.  Vairocana is the Realisation
of the truth of this doctrine.</p>

<p>In twas because he was much moved by the majestic Avatamsaka Sutra
that the Emperor Shomu decided to have a huge statue of the Buddha
Rushana constructed.  His wish and that of the those who built the
statue and have guarded it over the ages is that throught the grace of
the Buddha Rushana all living creatures may attain a state of
enlightenment in which they are bathed in the light of
understanding.</p>
