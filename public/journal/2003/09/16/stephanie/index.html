<p>I feel sad.</p>

<p>Stephanie is leaving Japan on Thursday.  My first
new-teacher-friend that I could hang out with comfortably and show her
how to buck the Nova system and joke about stupid stuff and walk
around and whatever.  Gone in less than a month.  We only hung out
like.. 3 times I think.  First I told her diplomatically, "fuck what
Scott says; your lesson was almost certainly fine; whatever you did
was fine."  Then we met at Subway when we had the same lunch.  Then we
zoomed down to Yokohama and munched at TGI Fridays and caught some of
the last trains home.  Then we went walking around Kawasaki and I
showed her Cinecitta area and we didn't eat at Tuk Tuk Thai food, but
we did yammer around the CD shop.  Most recent adventure was getting
Ocean's Eleven and watching that over Kraft macaroni after I soundly
beat her at Uno and then she barely beat me back.  We decided we'd go
to OZ together this winter break.  She felt a bit sick that night and
I told her not to die.  She didn't die, and I'm super thankful for
that.  But she didn't come in to work the next day.  Nor the next day.
Nor during her weekend as we bounced a few text messages that she was
feeling like crapola and the hospital couldn't figure anything
out.</p>

<p>Most recent message asked me to take her to the airport on
Thursday.  Sigh.  I'd be honored.</p>
