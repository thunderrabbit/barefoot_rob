                        <p class=date>7:39pm JST Sunday 1 June 2003</p>

<p>I've made it past the hump.   Into the far easier few days.</p>

<p>The hump each week is Saturday.  Thursday is okay - not too busy,
but I've just had the weekend, so it's both stinky to have to go back
to work, but the anticipation of the week is worse than the actual
Thursday.  I get there and think, "this isn't so bad"...</p>

<p>Friday is awesome cause I'm at KQ, where we have a bunch of man to
mans or free lessons.  Mostly I gaze out the window at the
construction next door.  Or study the Japanese that I learned with
Ayana that morning.</p>

<p>Saturday is when it hits.  Hafta get up for the early shift (after
having done the late shift), do tons of lessons, well, the same number
of lessons, but tons of people and it's just packed.  I can hardly
find the files for the next class much less write notes on the
previous files *and* find new files *and* design a good lesson.
But.. it's like I'm at peace with that.  It's like, "meh; what more
can I do?"  The good thing is I get off work before dark.</p>

<p>Sunday is not as bad as Saturday, but it's still an early shift,
which is kinda pooey.  But usually we're not as busy.  And the lessons
are all 40 minutes instead of some of them being 45 minutes.</p>

<p>Monday is cake compared to the Sat and Sun.  And it's a late shift,
so I can sleep in.  I don't 100% like sleeping in, but I do it anyway,
cause I can.  I don't even let myself sleep in during my weekend.</p>

<p>Then Tuesday = no work!  I get to speak Japanese as much as I
want/can and have my Japanese class and it's all good.</p>

<p>Wednesday = no work!  Japanese learnin' with Koko and then do
whatever I want until the late shift on Thursday.</p>
