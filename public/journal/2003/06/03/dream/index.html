<p class=date>8:02am JST Tuesday 3 June 2003</p>

<p class=dream>I was in the passenger seat of my van as a friend of
mine was driving it.  I had been all, yeah, you can have the van; I
won't need it while I'm gone, and then after I had told him that, but
bfore I had actually given it to him, I remembered I had promised it
to Josephine. I was all like, "oh shit."  "Um, I just remembered
something" and I told him that I had already promised the van to
Josephine and that she would therefore get it, not him, and I wondered
about asking Josephine if he could use it just for one road trip and
*then* given it to her, but the issue remained; he had to not wreck it
while he was driving on the roadtrip, and insurance wouldn't cover it
if he wrecked cause it was still in my name, etc.  Eeek.</p>

<p class=dream>Then Jason Ficke was with us and we were stopped at
convenience store and some thugs were around us and Jason was flirting
with them like, "whoo whoo whoo! can't catch me!" kinda thing as he
was climbing out through the sunroof and then when a thug tried to get
Jason, Jason sidestepped and threw the thug headlong into the sunroof,
and he was therefore stuck, but didn't appear inside the vehicle; I
don't know where exactly he was stuck.</p>

<p class=dream>In retaliation, one of the thugs held Spot by his tail
and dangled him down through the sunroof and closed the sunroof on his
tail, but Spot was a remote control radio and shaped like a box with
an antennae, so It wasn't as painful as it could have been when I was
all, "drop him, <b>now</b>" and the guy dropped him by severing his
tail and Spot wouldn't move; I didn't know if he was okay, but he was
just a box, so I knew it wasn't the real Spot, but I was still a bit
shocked by it.</p>

<p class=dream>I escaped this situation by waking up.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class=dream>"Wouldn't it be weird if I woke up and this was all a
dream and I was actually still in Japan?"</p>

<p class=dream>I was back at home.  janette and I were hanging out and
cooking good American food and I was back at home.  We went on an
outdoor tour together and I had Spot with me.  We were riding on the
back of a pickup truck as it was being dragged along the ground. No
wheels. I had to hold Spot so he wouldn't jump off to explore the area
- it was too dangerous for him to safely explore..  Like it was a
jungle; he would have been zapped pretty quickly.</p>

<p class=dream>So I held onto Spot and we were moving along a trail
and some other people were having a picnic on the side. They were
also eco tourists and I was new to the group, but my group and their
group knew one another, though they were in different parts of the
group... Our group liked the sun and their group liked something
else, or was it the other way around? and someone in our group yelled
mock-taunting over to them, hey you don't like the sun!

<p class=dream>By that time in the trip we had stopped and Spot was
allowed to get off, as he seemed content to stay near our thing. and
eat cottage cheese that someone had dropped and I was being asked to
try some new food.  Like some kind of meat or something and it was
okay.</p>

<p class=dream>Then Spot was back on the truck with me and we were
being dragged to the end of the trek and then were back in janette's
living room. So great to be back home again.  What a wonderful
adventure, but I was was happy to be back at home.  Gosh, life sure is
great back at home.  Wouldn't it be weird if this were all a dream and
I was actually still in Japan?</p>

<p class=dream>"Yeah, that would be werid."</p>

<p>D'oh!</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class=dream>I was Eminem and being chased by bad guys.  I was mean,
since I was Eminem, so I had no problem killing people.  Well, it was
a bit tough to slam a guy's face into the corner of something,
especially when he was Lyle from my work, and was all, "I guess i'm
gonna die" in his Lyle way, so I let him live, but just be unconsious
so he wouldn't kill me.</p>

<p class=dream>Lyle had been Mike, and had come in with a 22 pistol
with six shots and when he shot at first, he couldn't see where he was
shooting so he didn't hit me.  I held up an ottoman and was going to
throw it at him, but then I realized he could see the ottoman and
would therefore know where I was, so I used it as a shield and when he
fired his remaining four shots, I caught them with the ottoman, almost
as cool as Neo in the Matrix.  I could just about see the bullets
coming at me.</p>

<p class=dream>I was going to jump outside, but there were bars on the
window and I couldn't break them down.  I was going to throw Lyle
through it, but he was too heavy, so I was going to jump through, but
I couldn't, so I had to sneak out into the hallway and hope they
didn't see it. Jon (who reminds me of my cousin Peter) was out there,
maybe with Jon Lo, and they didn't recognize I was the bad guy cause I
looked like Rob and they were looking for Eminem, but then I climbed
out another window, on the second floor and drop/floated down to a
ledge so I could be on the ground and get a password and be okay.  I
climbed off the house on Methil drive and was crawling back to the
back woods, hoping they would think I was a dog, and I got back to the
darkess where I was safe.</p>
