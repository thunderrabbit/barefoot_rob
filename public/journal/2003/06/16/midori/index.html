                        <p class=date>5:06pm JST Monday 16 June 2003</p>

<p>Just had "Crazy Midori" in a lesson with another woman (Rieko) who
seemed to have a far superior grasp of English.  Midori just went on
her own tangents or forgot who was the customer in the role plays, "oh
oh custamah" pointing to herself.  And then point to Rieko,
"custamah?"  who by that point was obviously stifling laughter.  Oh it
was just ridiculous.</p>

<p>Midori laughed at the idea of reserving tickets to a movie theater
(once we explained that cinema = theater), "I don't know America, but
no reservation movie theater Japan."  And Rieko is just making faces,
trying not to laugh, but then she just busted out when Midori jumped
back to "I customah?  reservation restaurant?"</p>

<p>I worked to communicate with both of them on their own levels,
favoring Rieko because I imagined my efforts with her would more
positively affect the world than helping Midori work out who was the
customer.</p>

<p>I am so thankful for Rieko's good natured reaction to the whole
thing, and I really hope she learned something.  I wrote for her the
language that she seemed to have not previously heard, and she scooped
that up at the end of the lesson.  More precisely, Midori scooped up
all the pages I had written, and Rieko gingerly requested those couple
of sheets I had catered to her.</p>

<p>Kaori, who's one of our regular students, didn't attend the lesson.
I wonder if she saw Midori there and said "false" .... Cause Kaori is
in the voice room now, so it's not like she went home.</p>
