                        <p class=date>6:29am JST Friday 26 December 2003</p>

<p>Just now getting home from my day.</p>

<p>Work is a faded memory.  Had some students.  Taught some lessons.
  Went with Neil, Andrew and Phong to get some food for Carla's
  Christmas pot luck party.  I led the way kinda to her house.  Good
  stuff.  I bought lettuce at Carla's request.  Nice to be part of the
  group.</p>

<p>Party was fun; lots of talking and chowing after the staff arrived
  (Rumi, Tomoko, Junko, Masayo, and Rumi's friend Kyouko).  Nothing
  really big except someone said something really funny but I don't
  remember what it was.  Woulda written it down had I had my
  computer.  Um...  I can't remember.</p>

<p>Yuuko called me during the party and invited me to New Year's with
  her and I hesitated then accepted.  She's the first to directly
  invite me to something, so okay.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>People left around 11:30pm to catch the last trains and I stayed,
  along with Lyle, Clayton, Rumi, Tomoko, Junko, Kyouko, Carla.  We
  went to the nearby bar where I learned some Japanese vocab including
  §Œ§…§¡§Û§≥ and others.</p>

<p>I talked to Kyouko and learned that she works for a travel agency
  and part of her job includes leading youth group tours overseas.</p>

<p>bang.</p>

<p>Didn't ask for her number, but that part of her job description
  was duly noted in my mind.</p>

<p>Went back to Carla's just before 5am and the trains started at that
  time so instead of trying to sleep there (as fun as my imagination
  could make it be with a bunch of cute Japanese women), I opted to
  come home to sleep.  Kyouko came with me as far as Yokohama station
  where she took a JR line to Shinjuku.</p>

<p>Ohhhhhhh big lucky news is that my Friday teacher called me and
  cancelled our lesson which is really good news cause I basically had
  forgotten about the lesson.  Oh lucky day.</p>

<p>Bed time.  But I want to call my parentals briefly first.</p>
