                        <p class=date>12:48am JST Tuesday 9 December 2003</p>

<p>Huge bawling tears on the phone with janette tonight.  We talked
  about Miki and I recognize just how horrible a situation this is
  for her; it's just like Miki is the innocent victim in this; she's
  cuter than cute and seems to really like me, but I'm unavailable
  and still hanging out with her in a way where part of me is wanting
  for more, but I'm telling her and reminding myself no no no.</p>

<p>A few moments ago had I been typing, there'd be none of this silly
  grammatical correctness.</p>

<p>I feel so much shame at myself for all the women with whom I've
  fallen in love and broken up with, Miki, janette, Sally, Wende,
  Amanda, Christine, Tammy, Lynda, and that's just counting the main
  ones and *not* counting the abortion and the miscarriage.  My
  relationship life is a fucking nightmare and I want to stop the
  pattern.  I want to solve this, but the problem seems unsolvable.
  What could I possibly do that would help a fish not live in
  water?</p>

<p>How can I possibly change so that this ingrained pattern is
  released?</p>

<p>What is the first step?  Who do I talk to?  Can it be done in
  Japan?  Should it be done in Japan?  Why would I think there are
  right answers to this?  What guidance can I get from my angels?</p>

<p>So much sadness.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I wondered about living with Fred.  I like him; I like Austin.
  We could just be brothas together and I could go to some kind of
  counseling and get a job at Amy's Ice Cream and just live a simple
  life for a while.</p>

<p>(how does that feel?)</p>

<p class=date>7:28am JST Tuesday 9 December 2003</p>

<p>Oh, I also felt like it's just too late to start such a big
  impossible project.  Like by the time I fix this, I'll be a million
  years old and too old to do anything worthwhile.</p>

<p>I'm really good at starting new projects.  It's easy for me to
  fall in love with a new woman.  I don't seem to be as good at
  following through with projects.   I haven't even written about the
  coasters at Yomiuriland yet.</p>

<p>I have a great fear that if I leave Japan to embark on this bold
  adventure of healing myself of this hurtful relationship pattern,
  that I'll never completely follow through.  That comes from two
  points of view: 1) that it's an unsolvable problem and 2) that I
  don't finish projects.</p>

<p>If I leave Japan, there are many people that I would miss: Morag,
  Miki, Liz, Carla, Nami, Tomoko, Rieko, Ayana, Jen, Orivia ... I see
  that these are all women.  There is something amiss in this
  situation.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>As I think about this idea of leaving Japan to heal myself, I want
  all sorts of external validation for my decision.  Kristen told me
  most clearly that this must come from within.  janette told me most
  encouragingly that it's okay to seek external advice when the
  problems seem to have no solutions.</p>

<p>I want to ask Rebecca Montgomery, my psychic friend from a long
  time ago.  I want to ask Kim Sawyer.  I'm still in touch with him so
  I'll send him this entry.  I want to ask Maggie, who has done
  similar internal transformative growth and supports me in whatever I
  do.  I want to ask Wende, who knows me the best and often tells me
  straight from her heart.  I want to ask my I-group.  How the fuck
  could I forget about them?</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>If I move to Austin, I could work at Amy's Ice Cream.  That might
  be fun.  I wonder what else I could do for work.  Morag is the first
  person to ever tell me that waiting tables is really fun.  I wonder
  if I would like that.  I wonder if I could get a job as a counselor;
  Frank has done this recently.  Do I have the official
  credentials?</p>

<p>If I move to Austin, I could hang out with my brother, my mom and
  that guy more easily.</p>

<p>If I move to Austin,</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I could ride my bike most places I need to go (and get lots of
    exercise with all the hills)</p></li>

<li><p>I would be in Texas (Wende's favorite state) and Wende would be
    in California (my favorite state (except Hawaii, but it shouldn't
    be a state; we should release the islands to the natives, but
    that's a different story)).</p></li>

<li><p>I could join an I-group.  (I could actually drive to Houston
    each week (given a car) and attend *my* I group)</p></li>

<li><p>I could volunteer at 91.7 KVRX or KOOP.  (Hell fuckin' yeah
    that would be pimp to get back into radio)</p></li>

<li><p>I have a great fear that I would never get myself back out
    "into the world"</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Oh shit here is a big one...  I am afraid that if I heal this, that
  I will be grown up and that I won't be able to travel freely like
  this.  I wonder where that comes from.  There's a dual thought-form:
  ... yarg, I can't quite get it back again.  Something like if I
  solve this within myself I will be disinterested (too old? (as I
  said above) too mature?  too grounded?) in travel and therefore will
  have missed my opportunity, which I'm in right now.  I'm
  in <em>JAPAN</em> right now; why would I want to go back?</p>

<p>(( There is a corallary to this point which says that if I don't
  want to do something then I won't be concerned if I don't do it. But
  that doesn't really solve this concern. ))</p>

<p>I would *definitely* want to continue studying Japanese.</p>

<p>Wouldn't I?</p>

<p>-- -- -- --</p>

<p>Okay, I'm going to embark upon my day.  Letter to Bryn, Beans,
  Chez, and then meet Atsuko.  Oh shit I'm going to carefully check
  email first.  Carefully = cautiously.  No web browsing.  Only
  email.  Okay.  I promise myself.</p>

<p>Two(?) more things before I go:</p>

<p>1) If I leave now-ishly, then I will give Miki this art thing I've
  been working on.</p>

<p>2) I trust my angels guide me.</p>

<br>yay yay yay.<br>
  good work mate.<br>
yay for crying.<br>
    for looking at things the way they are and being able to talk it out and look at  yourself honestly.<br>
    for caring about miki's feelings and your need to change the current situation, at least for her sake.<br>
    for me having my name in  small case so i have some special-ness in your long list of used to be's.* <br>
    for you considering a simple life while you grow.<br>
    for taking  first steps.<br>
    for your fears and for your courage.<br>
    for the intuitive part of me that tells me you will heal and grow and be even more fucking awesome than you are now.<br>
    for you being rob.<br>

( i hate that i am not in a category all to myself. i hate that i am one of a list.  i hate that i did not have better control over my dreams.  i hate that people reading your journal have very little idea  of who i am. i hate that my ego is so demanding and uses the word hate so much.)
