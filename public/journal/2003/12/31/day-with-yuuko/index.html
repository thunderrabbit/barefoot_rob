                        <p class=date>10:58am JST Wednesday 31 December 2003</p>

<p>Taught Õµª“ how to say "HI Miss Llama; I've heard a lot about
  you."  Money.</p>

<p>Told  Õµª“ about Silent Football (briefed her on the concept of no
  actual football and the two offensive moves) as we took the Tokaido
  line from ¿Ó∫Í to ≈Ïµ˛... but then...</p>

<p class=date>12:09pm</p>

<p>We got way lost, well maybe not way lost, but got on the ª≥§ŒºÍ
  line the wrong direction and Yuuko was like, "we are going to
  Shinagawa," which is exactly where we had been before so we checked
  the map and jumped off the train and back on the other direction and
  we got a little lost in Tokyo station, trying to get on the Sobu
  line but Yuuko was like, "this ain't quite right, jack" and she
  asked a station guy and we got on the Chuo line and made it here
  basically promptly.</p>

<p class=date>5:20pm</p>

<p>I keep getting interrupted; most recently by a visit with Karen for
  some hours as we ate, rode the roller coasters and generally had a
  grand time gossiping here in Tokyo Dome City.  She's the (unpaid)
  executive coordinator for a <a href="https://www.portlandart.org">fly
  art zoo</a> in Portland.</p>

<p>Yuuko got sick-ish on the indoor rollercoaster and didn't ride the
  next two things, but she did ride the subsequent everythings,
  including the Pocari Sweat sponsored Wonder Drop; we sat both in the
  back the first time then both in the front the second time.  got a
  little •”•∑•Á•”•∑•Á but it was still fun.  Then watched a guy do
  mostly a talk performance, but ultimately he rode a giraffe unicycle
  and juggled, including some oddly shaped knives and an apple.  Good
  stuff, but more showmanship than physical performance.</p>

<p>Now we've just eaten in Cafe Danmark. §™§§§∑§§°£</p>

<p class=date>10:38pm JST Wednesday 31 December 2003</p>

<p>Um.  Long train ride to hakkeijima sea paradise.  Long wait in line
  to ride Surf Coaster.  Special thanks to the hitos who waited for us
  20 feet worth of line while I tried to but free passes.  Special
  unthanks to the machine for not having free passes available.  I'm
  trying (wtf (*) that means) to get over having paid 1000 yen for the
  ticket and THEN buying a free pass.  Grr.  But oh well.</p>

<p>(*)whatEVER </p>

<p>Having fun with Õµª“.</p>

<p class=date>1:28am JST Thursday 1 January 2004</p>

<p>I'll probably put up a (I've forgotten the word) page of pictures
  for the aquarium that's in »¨∑ ≈Á•∑°º•—•È•¿•§•π (Hakkeijima Sea
  Paradise); they've got some pretty fly aquatic animals and an
  annoying number of girls going "kawaiiiii" (cute) fucking over and
  over at every little thing the animals do or are.</p>

<p>Õµª“ and I are running out of energy, which I predicted in half of
  my mind when I was like, "welp, I'll bah me a all day pass ifins
  it'll be good fer alla tomorra, but ifin it's only good fer tonight,
  you ken fergit it."  or something like that.</p>

<p>We're sitting on the floor in the aqua museum beneath a sign that
says "no sleeping."</p>

<p>I'm hungry.</p>

<p class=date>5:46am JST Thursday 1 January 2004</p>

<p>We're now leaving Hakkeijima Sea Paradise.  Rode Surf Coaster four
  times, which isn't as many times as I rode it when I came with Liz
  on the rainy day, BUT we spent much more time at the coaster
  considering the line averaged over one hour per ride.  Eeeek.</p>

<p>We also rode the tall as drop tower and...  oh man that's all we
  did.  The lines were way long.  But, well, we scoped the fish and
  other quatic life in the aquarium which took plenty of time.</p>

<p>I can tell I'm tired since I'm not typing all that fast.   Maybe
  1/2 speed.</p>

<p>fuck I'm tired.</p>

<p>I taught Õµª“ the phrase "it's fuckin' cold."</p>
