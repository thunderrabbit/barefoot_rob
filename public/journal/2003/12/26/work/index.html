                        <p class=date>1:39am JST Saturday 27 December 2003</p>

<p>Morag and I worked at KQ today.  Notable:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It was the last day before our New Year's vacation.</p></li>

<li><p>I did a level check over ginganet for Hiyoshi (the school where
    Jen works; the station where Cory lives; one station away from
    Tsunashima) today.  This was my first ginganet anything.  I rated
    the student a solid level 4.  Definitely good enough to hold a
    conversation on any common topic.  Definitely had natural pauses
    and, um, hesitation devices, and was a great fun student to chat
    with.  Excellent comprehension at normal speed speech and good
    comprehension with high speed speech.</p>

<p>I wondered about ways to get her digits, but chose against any such
  behavior at that moment; she could be a Hiyoshi staff member for all
  I know.</p></li>

<li><p>Morag had a class of three students; one of whom gave little or
    no input, the other two of whom gave little or no input cause they
    were so busy flirting with one another.  She was really mad when
    she got out of that lesson.  I had the same three students plus
    one more student; I was ready to not be ruffled by any
    antics.</p>

<p>I got in there and (this story is going too slow for how tired I
  am right now) was "alright; you guys listen and then ask some
  questions."  I read 5 lines of text and they couldn't ask any
  quetions.  I read it again, and they still couldn't.  I prompted
  them with questions about the five lines and then read and then
  had them ask the questions.</p>

<p>They were able to get through this, and it took a long time.</p>

<p>Then I was all, alright; here are your 4 new questions for the next
  section, and I read the section and had them listen to the next
  part.  The first question: "how many times has Kay been here?"
  second: "how long has Doug been coming here?"  third: "who believes
  in ghosts and why?"  fourth: "what was Doug doing when he saw the
  ghost?"</p>

<p>First question took nearly five minutes to ask and answer.  One
  person asking (trying to repeat the question accurately) and the
  other three trying to get the correct answer.  One knew the
  grammar, and the other knew the answer.</p>

<p>Second question was answered, "Doug has been here for 2 hours,"
  which is true, but not the correct answer for the question.  "Good
  grammar; wrong answer."</p>

<p>((* I'm too tired to get a play by play written but *))</p>

<p>"Okay, please ask your question again"</p>

<p>"How long has Doug been coming here?"</p>

<p>"Okay, please repeat: how long has Doug been here?"</p>

<p>"Okay, please answer."</p>

<p>It took several variants of the above conversation before I was
  like, "please listen: How long has Doug been coming here?  How long
  has Doug been here?  This is really important that you
  understand."</p>

<p>Finally, somehow, they understood. Such a beautiful sight to see
  the lightbulbs in their minds. They were able to correctly ask and
  answer each question.  But we still had two more questions to go.</p>

<p>Slogged through the third question which they answered with some
  difficulty, and then to the fourth question.</p>

<p>"What was Doug doing before he saw the ghost?"</p>

<p>"He was sitting before he saw the ghost."</p>

<p>"Correct grammar."</p>

<p>"bicycle."</p>

<p>"Yes.  Please make a sentence."</p>

<p>"He bicycle riding ghost the he saw before."</p>

<p>"Please give your answer again."</p>

<p>"He was sitting before he saw the ghost."</p>

<p>"Okay, please change the answer to bicycle."  (I noticed that this
  was not a trivial change, but oh well.)</p>

<p>"He was bicycle riding before he saw the ghost."</p>

<p>"Close.  Please repeat.  " (at this point the bell rang.  School
  is out for the winter break.  I can go home and sleep.)</p>

<p>"Please repeat: He was riding his bicycle before he saw the
ghost."</p>

<p>I made all four students correctly repeat that phrase before they
  left.</p>
</ol>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Relayed the story to Morag who felt quite vindicated.  I was really
  happy cause though I may have been rough on them, they fucking
  learned something.  Excellent.</p>
</li>

<p>Miki, oh Miki made me sad tonight.  I invited her to Ginza with me
  and Jen and Orivia and Grace, but we are meeting at 5 while Miki
  gets off work at 6.  Okay, just meet us, right?  False.</p>

<p>"I can't read a map, so I can't meet you.  I have never been to
Ginza."</p>

<p>"Mate.  You. can. do. it."</p>

<p>too late.  done deal.  she's not coming.</p>

<p>I practiced releasing.  I felt sad.  I can't date anyone who would
  give up that easily slash not believe in themselves enough to try.</p>

<p>I won't see her until next year.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I've fallen asleep multiple times during this entry.  I'm going to
  Odaiba with Carla, Clayton and Benny tomorrow.  I wanna get a
  disposeable camera before we go.</p>

<p>sleepy time now.</p>
