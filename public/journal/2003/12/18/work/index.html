                        <p class=date>12:01am JST Friday 19 December 2003</p>

<p>At work I was minding my own business in the teachers' room on a
  free lesson when one of the staff came in, "Robu, student is
  waiting."  and I had a momentary freakout that maybe I had read the
  schedule wrongly, but I hadn't; there was no name on the timeslot.
  J-lo was there to back me up (he's an AT (I think) or something) so
  that was cool; he handled the staff, and I went to the class and had
  a chat with the student (who hadn't brought his book and didn't want
  to use my book, but did want to level up) and I was like, "dawg, you
  gotta pick up the pace if you want to get to level 4" and I didn't
  tell him that he shouldn't even be in level 5, but more like he's a
  6 with a dangerous vocabulary and tries to overcomplicate
  everything, which I subsequently learned he was intentionally trying
  to overcomplicate so that his structures would be worthy of level
  5.</p>

<p>I like to think that my advice will be helpful for him.  Keep it
  simple and speed it up.</p>

<p>I explained that if the sentence is long and beautiful but takes an
  hour to say, we teachers are like, "wtf was the first part of that
  sentence; I can't remember it anymore..."  and I think he
  understood.</p>

<p>I made him tell me stories and then I told the same story in 30 to
  45 seconds that took him 4 or 5 minutes and I made him tell me the
  same story again in under a minute.  That helped his fluency some.
  In addition, I shortened his circumlocuitous manner of speaking.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Saw §´§™§Í, KG §ﬂ§≠ (there to sign up for more lessons), a
  different woman than §´§™§Í's §ﬂ§≠ who seemed to be hanging out with
  §´§™§Í though I don't remember ever having met her before, and §Ê§ø§´,
  who apparently was in Morag's Club 7 voice on shopping.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I learned the names of § §™§“§Ì, §»§‚§ §™, and §Í§Â§¶§∏, three
  level 6 men in my last class.  I am making a concerted effort to
  remember male students' names as well.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Had a chat with our level 2 student §Œ§Í§≥, whose name I can now
  remember.  I didn't remember until she mentioned that she's only
  been out of Japan once (to Waikiki and San Francisco) but her
  English is realllly good grammatically and structurally, but doesn't
  have the speed or intonation of a native.</p>
