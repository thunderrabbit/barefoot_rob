<p>Bang I'm awake.</p>

<p>I went pee, went back to bed, no sleepy sleep, so fine I'll get up
  and study.</p>

<p>I was lying in bed thinking about Nova (not surprising) and the new
  level up criteria.  I'm not sure why Nova is reducing the
  requirements for the different levels, but I've heard "there weren't
  enough level ups," which is just about the <em>worst</em> reason I
  can imagine for such a change.</p>

<p>At the same time, the change makes me interested in staying with
  Nova a bit longer just to see what life is like on the other side
  of that fence.  And a student said she liked my lessons best (and
  the lesson in question was one of my go in there and wing it cause
  I have no idea what I'm doing lessons).  Is working at Nova all
  that bad?  Yeah, I still hate it.  But why? why do I hate it? Cause
  I feel inept in the lessons and students .......  I had a good
  lesson last night - it was one that I thought went over pretty
  well.  I had drawn a map and had students give directions to
  various locations on the map.  I did not once open the book.  They
  were Level 6, and one of the lessons in the book is an Everyday
  Conversation (by far the least popular lessons in the book, with
  quality conversations such as</p>

<pre>
            Would you like a cigarette?
            No thanks, I'm trying to quit.
            Oh, come on, have one.
            No really, I have a terrible cough and sore throat.
</pre>

<p>which is a good example of why I think the book bites) for giving
  directions.  (( d'oh; it's raining.  cold and rainy = ewww ))
  Anyway I just thought the lesson went quite well.</p>

<p>A previous lesson was with four level 4 students, including
  disruptive pen-slamming Makoto, huge vocabulary Terumi, flight
  attendant Ritsuko (?), and one other student.  Ritsuko and the one
  other are quite capable, but wouldn't say anything during the
  warm-up ("what are alternatives to cars?" which I was just
  embarassed to ask because I couldn't think of any other way to get
  them to use the language "instead of" besides saying, "class, I want
  you to make sentences using 'instead of'," which I've tried before
  and it rarely works) even after Makoto and Terumi started talking
  and so I gave Ritsuko and the other a much broader question, "why do
  people use cars?" and this got them talking.</p>

<p>So I had four students and two different conversations going on
  (not unusual), and it was a bit of a trick for me to keep track of
  both of them.  Realistically I didn't; Makoto rarely takes the
  lessons seriously; I just heard Terumi saying "why do you think
  so?" over and over... what chaos.  But I left the lesson feeling
  like I had actually helped.</p>

<p>I had a lesson with I forget-her-name Level 2 student.  I had read
  in the comments that she's a solid level 2 (Scott said that) so I
  was like, fuck the book, and I went in there "HI I'm Rob.  I'd like
  you to drive this lesson."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"First, you decide
  if you want to use the book or not."</p>

<p>"Either way is okay."</p>

<p>"Please choose."</p>

<p>"No book."</p>

<p>"Okay," and we just talked, which was great for me; I was able to
  give her maximum talk time and help correct her errors and see her
  using the corrections correctly.  It felt like a good lesson to
  me.</p>

<p>So that's three lessons that seemed to go well yesterday.  Even
  though one started out like crap.  Do I think I'm a good group
  teacher?  No, but I'm getting better.  Do I know all the students'
  names?  No, but I'm learning more.  For a brief instant yesterday,
  I thought <em>I could settle in to this</em> or something like
  that.</p>

<p>brain is gone; maybe I'll sleep. 5:41am</p>
