<p>Had my Aries twin in a lesson today.  She's my twin only in sign;
  she's in HS I think and she drinks.  She did pretty well in the
  lesson.  We didn't totally bond cause there was another student this
  time.</p>

<p>Then I had a 7C cat who was totally hard core.  He knows more noun
  vocab in English than I do in Japanese and he could correctly
  distinguish and use "am" vs "do" two words which often vex Japanese
  learning English.</p>

<p>Just had Sachiko level 5, who has been here for about 10
  lessons.   She asked about "a" vs "the" and I gave her some
  examples and then she was like, "okay; I'm sorry to have
  interrupted the lesson."</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> have no lesson."</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Really.  Nova Usagi thinks I'm the worst Nova teacher ever."</p>

<p>"No..."</p>

<p>"Yeah.  <em>But</em>, I was going to look at #66.  It's past
  passives like, "Koizumi was seen at George Bush's ranch."  Past
  because it's in the past and passive "</p>

<p>"And passive because someone else looked at him."</p>

<p>"Exactly.  So do you want to do this or more A and The?"</p>

<p>"Articles."</p>

<p>"Excellent."</p>

<p>And that's what we did.</p>

<p>She's going to her friend's wedding tomorrow and wants to wear a
  Korean somethin' and her husband wants her to wear a kimono.  But
  she can't put on a kimono by herself (§π§ﬂ§´ agrees that it's not
  easy) and her husband doesn't know how to help her put it on
  either.</p>

<p>I was like, "you should tell him if he can help you put it on, you
  will wear it."</p>

<p>"You will make a good husband some day."</p>

<p><em>wow</em>, "thank you."</p>
