                        <p class=date>7:55am JST Thursday 10 April 2003</p>

<p>Good morning.  The briefest sentence describing the party:</p>

<p>Wow, she was loud.</p>

<p>About 12 hours ago Dru and I arrived at Ben's apartment for a
pre-party yammering session about whatever came up.  What came up: the
war and their travel stories.  I found out that there's a lot about
the world that I don't know.  Completely left out of their
conversation only because I had nothin to input.  They know shit about
Nigeria, Laos, Thailand, Viet Nam, South America.. it's like all of
their travel stories <em>crush</em> all my travel stories.  Is that
possible?  Doesn't my 11,000 mile driving trip hold some merit or some
interest to their however-many mile backpacking trips?</p>

<p>Backpacking.  Like it's the only real form of travel - to pave the
way for the hordes, thereby destroying the area for future backpackers
or even the original backpackers.  They were saying shit like how
Thailand *used* to be cool to visit but now it's been overrun by
visitors.  For a real adventure go backpacking in Laos.  Dru argued
that Thailand is the perfect place to learn backpacking: it's a
different culture and one has all the amenities one needs.  Then once
one is more comfortable, head on North and slip across the border into
Laos where the territory is less frequented, so far untainted by the
hordes.</p>

<p>There's a whole new culture out there - a subculture that thrives
on exploring new cultures.  One with adventure in its blood and
something else eloquent describing the free spirit.</p>

<p>Ben said his friend (who seems to look like my friend Kristen)
lives in Egypt and the locals *love* her and call her the queen.  Or
the princess or something.  He suggests that the media we see...</p>

<p class=message>wow you know this is a really beautiful part of outer
Tokyo.  We're on a train from Takao to Tachikawa (I hope I hope) and
going through a tunnel now because we were just through some tree
coated valley with slender pines arching toward Heaven, twinkling
gently in the sun.</p>

<p>...that the media we see shows us fabricted foreign-government
organized rallies spewing hatred toward the US...  that actually most
of the locals have no idea who the enemy is..  and </p>

<p class=message>(hold please) How is this possible?  Oh so clearly
the physical sign I saw next to the train indicated Shinjuku and Tokyo
as stops for the train I boarded.  However, we went through beautiful
mountains cause we were headed *out* of Tokyo.  Sigh.</p>

<p class=message>I've dismounted the train at Sagamiko.  Trains are
not as common here as they are closer to Tokyo.  And I'm down to 23%
battery on my computer; I didn't plug it in last night.</p>

<p>basically he was saying it's okay to roll over to Egypt and if one
is female with blondeish reddish hair and fair complexion they might
call one queen.</p>

<p class=message>I took a train back toward Takao and *everyone* got
off and tons of people got on.  I asked and the woman said it would
not go the direction I wanted to go, that I should use the other
platform.  Seems that this was the end/beginning of the line, which
explains why I had a seat, but doesn't explain the signage.  I'm
thankful that I asked.  I seem to be on a train that's going the right
direction now.</p>

<p>So.  Um, so they talked about travel and the war and I was left out
out out of the conversation with nothing apparent to add.  Though I
did get one maybe two intelligent comments in.  Aright.</p>

<p>Then people started arriving.  I kept up with names for the first 8
people or so.</p>

<p class=message>7% battery power remains.  TTFN.</p>

<p class=date>11:51am</p>

<p class=message>Okay; I'm dressed for work and waiting for my train.
Good thing that on the way to work I transfer and end at big stations
that all the different trains visit if they stop at my
station. &lt;crossing fingers></p>

<p>So..  the party.  Oh, so anyway fuck the detailed version; a ton of
people came and one girl was sooooo loud!  Like..  like...  I was
embarassed to be there, knowing this party was WAY too loud to have in
an apartment in Japan.  Japanese cats are pretty loathe to complain,
but we got a complaint.  If we had been in the US, certainly we would
have had cops over unless it was Friday on a college campus for
partiers.  I mean the shit was LOUD.  Caterwalling screeching as bad
as that movie where Cameron Diaz' character was made to karaoke and
she was terrible, but just kept at it.  Well this girl kept at it and
kept on keeping at it to the point that like <em>everyone</em> was all
oh my god shut her up!  But trying to see the humor in it, but it
wasn't funny at all.</p>

<p>I kept thinking how unimpressed I was with this party.  I was
loathe to say anything because I was the new guy in this group, etc,
.. but I did say something to her, but it didn't help.  at all.</p>

<p>She reminded me of that episode of the Simpsons where Barney is
video recorded dressed in Marge's clothes and drinking beer off the
floor...  Does Annie know what an obnoxious caterwalling maniac she's
being?  Standing on a chair, screeching into a Jack Daniel's
bottle-mic..  Eeeeee.</p>

<p>I did have fun talking to Drew, Penni (from Melbourne?), and
Jennifer (from Duncanville (Dallas)).</p>

<p>The trains stop running at midnight and I was still pretty much
having fun so I committed myself to staying overnight.  By 2 or 3am
though I was sleepin' in Ben's room on his futon.  Andrew slept on a
sleepin' bag.  Super duper special thanks to Ben for allowing us a
place to crash out.</p>

<p>The party was still rockin', but I slept using my super hero power
of being able to sleep anywhere.  Andrew's super hero power is even
better; he was sawing logs before I was.</p>

<p>About an hour (?) later, Annie (our caterwalling singer) came in
all, "what are you doing?"</p>

<p>"Sleeping; you should try it sometime."</p>

<p>Woke up in the morning around 8am to head home (getting lost on the
way), eat, shower, change, go to work.</p>
