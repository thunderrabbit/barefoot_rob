<p class=note>(my chopsticks pulled apart perfectly)</p>

<p>On the way home from work I rode with Olivia on the trains.  Olivia
recently purchased a new bicycle and really promoted having a bike.
She loves it.</p>

<p>As she sped away on her bike I was left with myself.  No bike.  Why
don't I have a bike?  Is it better to send my bike over here from
Dallas or to get one here?  Why don't I just go get one?  (money) Why
don't I just go jump online for a sec and upload my entries? (Money)
Why don't I just get internet access at the apartment? (don't know how
much MONEY it will cost) Grr grr grr grr</p>

<p>Why am I so stuck on money?</p>

<p>Partially I'm money-blind right now.  I don't seem to know how much
is in my account at home; I don't know how much is in my account
here.  I don't know how my money here will get home and how many US $
my yen will become.  Am I wealthy here?  Am I going to be able to pay
off my debt in a year, save up enough $ to travel to Singapore when
I'm done, romp around Europe after that, pay for private Japanese
language tutoring, eat at the sushi train, drink a liter of orange
juice every night, get internet access here at the crib?</p>

<p>Go see Eminem?</p>

<p>Buy more memory for my computer?</p>

<p>What are my priorities?</p>

<p>Why did I originally come to Japan?  (It all started when I decided
I want to be paid to lead youth group tours around the world.  I
called a company and they asked if I had in-country experience.  I
didn't have it.  I decided to live in Japan for a year so that I could
call them back and say "yeah, I've lived in Japan for a year, and I
know Japanese; I know the culture.")</p>

<p>So that makes me think learning Japanese oughta be a priority for
me.</p>

<pre>
Priorities:
learn Japanese
</pre>

<p>Why am I working in Japan?  To pay off the debt I've accumulated
while driving around the country.  So that makes working slash making
money slash winning in pachinko parlors a priority</p>

<pre>
Priorities:
learn Japanese
make some bling bling
</pre>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I talked to Janette and felt much better after that.  It seems that
I'm money-blind right now; I don't know what resources I have
available.  I don't seem to be Zen enough to just say meh; I still
want to pay off my debt, and I still want to see Eminem.  And
Japan.</p>

<br>a.) money is the devil, though necessary and required for life and whatnot&hellip;.HOWEVER, you know that you are not broke. I say you combine your priorities to learn japan and see eminem.  You may go to the concert if you teach yourself how to say &ldquo;Excuse me sir, I&rsquo;d like to purchase one ticket to Eminem. How many yen will that cost? I&rsquo;d like to sit in the __th row. Thank you.&rdquo; SEEEEEEE?!!? PROBLEM SOLVED!!!! hot damn i&rsquo;m a genius. <br>
oh! and i got your letter! i was havin gthe most craptastic day and it made me smile soooooo much! hurrah for japanese advertisements from kleenex package samples!!! i&rsquo;m now the envy of all my friends who wish they had cool people in JAPAN to send them mail! i miss/love you to reeses pieces!!!<br>
