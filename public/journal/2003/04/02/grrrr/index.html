<p>ARG</p>

<p>Today was a bit fucked up at work because the lesson that felt the
best where the students had the most fun and talked most with one
another, I got negative feedback on because I hadn't followed the Nova
approved method.  </p>

<p>Fuck that fucked up bullshit.  Are these motherfuckers trying to
learn English and become comfortable speaking it or do they care about
making sure they hit steps 1, 2, 3, 4?  </p>

<p>This was the class after which they thanked me most profusely,
where they spoke the most English..  Grrrrrrrr</p>

<p>But just *one* more day of OJT and then I won't be watched by
hawks, or by the jolly good Steve from England who, bless his heart,
really likes working at Nova.</p>

I know what you mean about doing what you call a good job teaching--based<br>
on the smiles and success of your students--and then have your superiors <br>
turn around and give you a poor review because you didn't do it Their Way.<br>
When she said that she didn't like what I did, I was so furious I could <br>
hardly see straight.  When I got back to my office, it was all I could do <br>
not to rant about her, and loudly, in the most colorful terms possible; <br>
I would have, too, but two of my students were waiting for me there.  <br>
I had to excuse myself for about ten minutes while I calmed the fuck down.  <br>
They knew I was pissed, though, and they knew exactly why.  <br>
<br>
My recommendation to you first and foremost is that you lean heavily on <br>
those teachers who you trust for advice.  Second, try to remember that <br>
while you are in fact being paid to teach Their Way, there is always <br>
flexibility, since people are different.  <br>
<br>
I have to say that here in the beginning, you should try your very best to<br>
evolve a teaching method that is within the Nova Way, but has a style you<br>
find natural and are proud of.  After a while, if you're not satisfied, <br>
begin to favor your own style at the expense of the Nova Way.  Keep the <br>
letter of the Nova Way as much as possible, though.  <br>
<br>
At that point, if someone official comes to you and says they don't like <br>
something you did, you have good grounds for defense:<br>
(i) they like you,<br>
(ii) they've seen you do it Their Way,<br>
(iii) you utilize the letter of Their Way--*which is all they can require*,<br>
(iv) you are doing the best you can.<br>
Also, in the particular case of whatever it was you "did", you can talk <br>
about the specific details of the situation, and no one will be able to fault<br>
you for your decisions, because you make good decisions, and you're doing the <br>
best you can.  <br>
<br>
In my own situation, I basically told the person to fuck off, because I knew<br>
I couldn't be fired, I knew I would never be working in that program again,<br>
I knew the person reviewing me wasn't very important, and I knew that spending<br>
the hour spoon-feeding that one student (neglecting everyone else) was more <br>
important than the official method of "force them to swim".  <br>
<br>
Good luck, G, and as Dad told me once, you have to give a new job at least a <br>
week before giving up.  <br>

<br>Oh, and forward that back to me so I can have it for posterity.<br>
<br>
PPS: The button to send this form says, "Submit Query".<br>
I think it should say "Submit Comment" or something like that.<br>
