<p>No foolin' it's been a week that I've not had my computer online.
Hopefully soon I'll get that rectified.</p>

<p>I had dreams last night including a scene where we were all in a
room for a class of some sort and Michael Jackson (the new Michael
Jackson) was outside the window and people were taunting him.  I was
like, "hey, listen.  That cat worked his ass off and made a million
jillion kazillion dollars.  Just because he's changed doesn't mean
it's appropriate to gawk at him and treat him like an animal." or
something like that.</p>

<p>Most recent dream included Tammy and Christie from my late high
school days as we were remembering all the good times and fun games we
had played like The Seven Game and Silent Football.  (in 'reality' we
did play the seven game, but not SF)</p>

<p>So I have a few hours off from work this morning to clean my room
that's still not perfectly organized, and has actually gotten a little
bit fucked up with all my Nova shit dumped everywhere on the floor as
I'm sorting through it all.  Part of it I want to archive in a scrap
book which I don't have yet, and part of it I might need for future
reference, and part of it is just trash to be chunked.  Er,
recycled.</p>
