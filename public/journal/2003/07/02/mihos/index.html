<p>Magic happens.</p>

<p>Leaving the internet cafe, I rode by Miho's, (a restaurant with a
waitress so friendly that we named it after her (they call their
restaurant Hiro's, but we call it Miho's), we being Frank and Matty,
and I picked it up from them.) to make sure I knew where it was
located. I intended to take Shin (and Rie) there last week, but I
couldn't remember where it was.</p>

<p>So I found it this week and while bicycling across the river, a
smiling face came the other direction and was all, <em>HI!</em> and I
was running her through my facial recognition process and was amazed
to realize she was Miho!</p>

<p>How totally incredible!  I've only seen her twice, both times at
the restaurant (yes, I've been there twice and I couldn't find it a
third time.  (equally incredible)) and she totally recognized me!</p>

<p>I was like, "check it yo, I'm planning to come see you tonight!"
and she was of course delighted as she seems to be by anything and
everything, so it was all just great great great.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>At Miho's I suddenly realized that though I had planned to pay for
dinner, I didn't have enough cash cause I had paid for shinkansen
tickets yesterday (6500 yen) and hadn't tucked into my wallet the cash I
got from Aki today for tutoring her.</p>

<p>Hmmm..  Maybe it won't be all that expensive.  Maybe I can practice
letting the blood drain out of my face in embarassment when I open my
wallet. I released the problem.</p>

<p>Later, Shin offered to pay for the meal via "dinner is always on
me."</p>

<p>I saw an easy out, and I was like "I will never turn down a free
meal" and left it at that.  But when it was actually time to go, he
paid me for the tutoring (3000 yen) and I was like, "but *I* will pay for
the meal."</p>

<p>He goes, "this time only."</p>

<p>"Okay."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>At the same time that I'm embarassed by the notion of the West
enforcing such a fucked up language as English on the world, I'm
thankful to benefit from my fluency.</p>
