<p>Today at work during my last lesson I had a pleasant attractive
single female man to man.  Told her I had a girlfriend so she
shouldn't try anything sneaky.  But she did ask me what I like and I
tried to tell her but couldn't help but laugh a bit because I had this
little sketch by Brak in my head, where the climax goes, "Hello, My
name is Bongo, I like to climb on things, can I have a banana?  Eeek
eeek."</p>

<p>I carefully explained it to her and she thought it was funny.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>The man to man prior to that was with a super shy super quiet super
low 7C 12 year old girl.  I finally got her to name colors on some
animal flash cards I had brought as backup in case the warnings in her
file proved true.</p>

<p>Cracked out a little Japanese to break through to her.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>The four man lesson with all men was pretty good; I had them
querying each other about this woman's photo album in level 7A.
Several variants like, "what could she do when she was 12?" and "when
could she ride a horse?" and then a level 6 structure: "what was she
doing when this picture was taken?"</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Didn't have any of my girlfriends today.</p>

I am trying to read this book, &ldquo;The Field&rdquo; by Lynne McTaggart, but every few paragraphs or so give me the energy (or &ldquo;light&rdquo; as the book would call it) to trip out on an idea. An example is that it was talking about how, in quantum physics, things seem to only exist when they are observed. (Like subatomic particles) It&rsquo;s like the consciousness of the observer brings the observed into being. Ok. This got me wondering if it is the <em>imagination</em> of the observer that creates &ldquo;things&rdquo;&hellip; for example&hellip;. Does &ldquo;The Planet Jupiter&rdquo; have any relationship with the person it was &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; ? <br>
The guy had to expect to find something right?<br>
Maybe the person who discovered cancer was a deep down cynic.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;&rdquo;&rdquo; words words words<br>
<br>
oh rob,<br>
LOVE,<br>
