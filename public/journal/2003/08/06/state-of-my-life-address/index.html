<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol type="I">
<li><p>I'm feeling happier in Japan.  I've got some Japanese friends
who are girls, some of whom I met via Nova, which is a Nova No
No.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm working at Nova, and don't particularly like it, but it's
more bearable.  I will never love this company.  I may take my
vacation and run.  I may find some more private students and try to
forge my way forward that way.  That would mean getting new housing,
but we're getting screwed on housing.  I'm paying 72,000 yen, which
some peeps say is flat too much for my area.</p></li>

<li><p>Friends in Japan: Nami, Satoko, Jen, Olivia, Cory +
Janis, Carla, Mika.</p></li>

<li><p>Janette is coming to visit soon!  We're gonna have a ton of fun
and rock around the Kyoto, Osaka, and Nara area.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm so thankful for the support and love and goodies and
coversations from/to/with janette.</p></li>

<li><p>Need to call Yasuko to see if she was able to figure out prices
and such for trains to Kyoto et. al.</p></li>

<li><p>Ooooo if my computer costs more than 20,000 yen to update, I
can use my credit card on which I have a credit balance.  :-) I just
got the credit card in the mail after I lost the previous one with my
wallet back in April or May.</p></li>

<li><p>Oh, the updates to my computer include fixing the hinge that
broke during my dramatic exit from the train yesterday and upgrading
the memory.</p></li>

<li><p>Akisan is working again at the donut shop starting after
tomorrow.  So we're not going to have any more lessons together (after
tomorrow).  I wonder if I'll try to fill that space with another
student from findateacher.net.  I'll let it go for a while and see how
I feel.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm getting better at the language, sometimes the right words
want to come out.  Most times random Japanese phrases want to come
out.  The translation circus in my mind produces Japanese more readily
than Spanish.</p></li>

<li><p>I can see a solution to the navigation on my site; soon the
content will change somewhat dramatically, and the navigation will be
relatively consistent through all the content.  No more access to the
images through the clumsy interface.  No more (linked) access to the
images at all.  Might even produce a site map.  Might might spend some
time getting the search function to work.</p></li>

<li><p>I've begun to settle into not just my rut-routine, but kinda
sorta a tiny bit into the culture.  The western side of the culture
like watching movies.  And having friends.</p></li>

<li><p>Don't know how long I'll remain in Japan nor even what I'll do
after chillin' with janette in October.  My plan is like a big foggy
mystery to me after that.</p></li>

<li><p>Plan?  Anchor myself?  Release myself into buffeting winds of
life?  Who knows.</p></li>

<li><p>The shadow knows.</p></li>

<li><p>Japan: What a rush getting onto the Commuter Express train on
the Tokyu line at 7pm in Shibuya.  Pokerface Japanese all crashing
wordlessly into the train to get a seat.  I got one.  Woman beside me
nearly landed on me trying to sit next to me.  Fun stuff.</p></li>
