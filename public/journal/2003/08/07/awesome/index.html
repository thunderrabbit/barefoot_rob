<p>I received an awesome package from my mom and an awesome letter
from janette!  Package = shampoo and M&Ms.  Mmmmm. M&Ms.  Letter =
black paper and multiple markers and many pages.  I haven't even
finished reading it yet!</p>

<br>Hi, Rob,<br>
<br>
Glad the package got to you okay. I was worried about the shampoo. We&rsquo;re not really supposed to mail liquid, either. There was no tube of shampoo &ldquo;goo&rdquo; to be found.<br>
<br>
I&rsquo;m reading a book of autobiographical essays by David Sedaris (<em>Me Talk Pretty One Day</em>). Here are some excerpts from his essay &ldquo;See You Again Yesterday.&rdquo; He met a guy who has a house in France and this is about some of the annual trips they took for an August vacation&hellip;.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Hugh had moved to New York after spending six years in France&hellip; . There was, he said, a house in Normandy.  This was most likely followed by a qualifier, something pivotal like &lsquo;but it&rsquo;s a dump.&rsquo; He probably described it in detail, but by that point I was only half listening.  Instead, I&rsquo;d begun to imagine my life in a foreign country, some faraway land where, if things went wrong, I could always blame somebody else, saying I&rsquo;d never wanted to live there in the first place.  Life might be difficult for a year or two, but I would tough it out because living in a foreign country is one of those things that everyone should try at least once.  My understanding was that it completed a person, sanding down the rough provincial edges and transforming you into a citizen of the world.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see this as a romantic idea.  It had nothing to do with France itself, with waring hats or writing tortured letters from a sidewalk cafe. I didn&rsquo;t care where Hemingway drank or Alice B. Toklas had her mustache trimmed. What I found appealing in life abroad was the inevitable sense of helplessness it would inspire.  Equally exciting would be the work involved in overcoming that helplessness. There would be a goal involved, and I like having goals&hellip; .<br>
<br>
&hellip; &ldquo;On my fifth trip to France I limited myself to the words and phrases that people actually use.  From the dog owners I learned &lsquo;Lie down,&rsquo; &lsquo;Shut up,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Who shit on this carpet?&rsquo; The couple across the road taught me to ask questions correctly, and the grocer taught me to count. Things began to come together, and I went from speaking like an evil baby to speaking like a hillbilly. &lsquo;Is thems the thoughts of cows?&rsquo; I&rsquo;d ask the butcher, pointing to the calves&rsquo; brains displayed in the front window. &lsquo;I want me some lamb chops with handles on &lsquo;em.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
By the end of our sixth trip to France, the house wasfinished and I&rsquo;d learned a total of 1,564 words. It was an odd sensation to hold my entire vocabulary in my hands, to look back through the stack and recall the afternoon I learned to effectively describe my hangovers&hellip; .<br>
<br>
&ldquo;When the cranes arrived to build a twelve-story hotel right outside our bedroom window, Hugh and I decided to leave New York for a year or two, just until our resentment died down a little. I&rsquo;l determined to learn as much French as possible, so we&rsquo;ll take an apartment in Paris, where there are posters and headlines and any number of words waiting to be captured and transcribed onto index cards, where a person can comfortably smoke while making a spectacular ass of himself, and where, when frustrated, I can lie, saying I never wanted to come here in the first place.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I thought you could relate to some of this. Hope you enjoyed it!<br>
<br>
Love,<br>
<br>
Ma&ndash;I&rsquo;ll write more in a moment&hellip;..</p>
