<p>The madness in my mind wonders if I've been fired by janette.  I
called twice, and the guilty conscious of mine knows that I wrote what
previously had only been spoken, so when she didn't answer, and hasn't
emailed me recently, I wonder if I'm in trouble.</p>

<p>I hope not; for selfish reasons, I don't want her visit here to
suck; the madness has considered paying her back for an imperfect trip
to Japan.  For positive reasons, I want to remain close; I don't want
to have angered my friend.</p>

<br>sweet sweet<br>
 i hated seeing what you wrote in black and white. (if only you had written in  pink. or blue.)<br>
  i liked it better when things were &ldquo;maybe.  possibly.  probably not, but one never knows!  hmmm, how could this work?  if it did work&hellip;   in the meantime, since we don&rsquo;t know&hellip;.&rdquo;<br>
  it has taken me some time to let the hurt feelings settle and see what the reality is and how to find peace with it.  i consciously did &ldquo;not&rdquo; fire you in my mind or stay in the blaming path when i felt myself wander there.<br>
  i cannot see into the future.  i know what my heart wants most of the time.  i can even see what my heart refuses to see, sometimes.  but i really cannot say for sure what is in my heart. i remember thinking i wanted to marry this one boyfriend i had.  i felt it in my heart that we should be together.  now i thank god i didn&rsquo;t marry that guy. so now i know i cannot be sure what is in my heart. <br>
   this is what i do know. <br>
   <br>
i love you.<br>
even tho i am the one who put it in words,(&ldquo;i know you are not my mate&rdquo;) i feel sad about being rejected.<br>
i choose to love you in whatever way is healthy for me and you. if that means letting you go and finding someone else to play with, so be it. <br>
i don&rsquo;t <em>want</em> to let you go.<br>
i want to play with you.<br>
i love being connected with you. it feels like there is more fun to be had.  more lessons to learn from each other.<br>
my connection to you feels nourishing. the thought of being without you now feels like an emptiness and a loss of joy.<br>
but, when i put it on, it also felt like starting over.  and there is a sense of freedom and strength there.<br>
we are together for a reason. when it&rsquo;s time to part,i will be ok.<br>
i want to have another adventure with you.<br>
if we stay honest with one another, we will be good friends for a long, long time.<br>
i will think of you as a fornow boyfriend, not a forever boyfriend.<br>
i talk too much.<br>
<br>
i heard the phone ring this am and i cried .  the irony is ironical. i have been wanting you to call me  in the middle of the nite.  but i did not answer because my thoughts and emotions were still so raw and jumbled. instead, i waited a while then rode around the lake. and i did not think for a long time.<br>
  the second time you called i was taking jack back to denton.  on the way home, i thought and thought.<br>
  now, i feel better.<br>
<br>
  i want you to stay committed to not having sex with anyone else until i get there.   i will do the same. i am going to have a great time in japan with you. let&rsquo;s face it, we like each other and we know how to have fun. <br>
  then we&rsquo;ll just see what happens.<br>
  ok?<br>
i love you,rob.<br>
