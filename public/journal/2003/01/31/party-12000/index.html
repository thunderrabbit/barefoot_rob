                        <p class=date>2:05am CST Saturday 1 February 2003</p>

<p>Yay for a great and awesome super great terrific 12,000th day
party!!!  Lots of people showed up over the evening, starting with
Molly, Will and Anna, ended with Fred, though I think Charyl came in
after him.  She was only there for a minute (or five).</p>

<p>Way awesome having a book for people to sign.. Brilliant idea from
Maggie to bring markers and map pencils for lovely colors.  Oh, the
beginning of the evening was me and Maggie passing notes back and
forth like in our college days.  The highlights of our notes included
a cartoon guy slipping in menstral blood in the hallway and a poem:</p>

<pre>
If the hair has gone dred,
don't take it to bed.
If the hair's cut back,
then have a snack!
</pre>

<p>We laughed a long time on that!!</p>

<p>Kathy Fey was next after Molly and Will, I think.  Great to see
her; hadn't seen her in quite a while.</p>

<p>In order of what my memory remembers: Tim brought a 1/64th scale
remote control car available only at Radio Shack.  It was a lot of fun
to put together and drive around on the tables.  It took me a bit to
remember Cynthia's name!  I was like "eeeek!" in my mind, but I
remembered it after a bit.</p>

<p>Phat Pat and Tina were early arrivals, beginning the YRUU presence.
Pat drew a crazy couple of pictures in the *middle* of the book, which
started the chaos of people drawing all over the place in it.</p>

<p>I don't know if kT saw that I was wearing as a bracelet a necklace
she made for me a long time ago.</p>

<p>Marcel and Kayse brought Nicholas, their youngest; he's 10 weeks
old.  He slept a lot and Tina wanted to hold him, but she was too shy
to ask Kayse.</p>

<p class=date>3:26am CST Saturday 1 February 2003</p>

<p>I'm tired.  I went to Eckerd's (closed), Randall's & Kroger's,
looking for a mouthguard thing.  R & K were open, but didn't stock
what I want.  At Maggie's now.  Read through the black book, which has
more than 1/2 blank pages it seems, but they are strewn throughout the
book.</p>

<p>I want to write lots more, but I'm mostly just flat tired.  I'll
write 5 more things tonight:</p>

<p>~) It was fun driving the 1/64 car in circles inside a pizza dish
cover</p>

<p>!) Kristen and Catherine mostly stuck together during Silent
Football, though they didn't last long in the game.  They were all
talking and not paying attention, given they saw no real purpose to
the game.  When I put Fred between them, I meant it as a punishment to
him since he had wanted to get away from them, but they didn't take
too kindly to that and they both merged to one seat beside Fred.</p>

<p>@) Jennifer from PT! brought the bowls that Erika and I painted.
Erika did not show up.  Jennifer's friend Sarah smelled really good.
I would have enjoyed hugging her twice, but didn't want to be too
obvious or make her feel uncomfortable.</p>

<p>#) Tim also gave me a Jillian's card with 3000 points on it.  After
most everyone left, Fred, Maggie and I put most of the food in to-go
boxes and then played games downstairs.  To show for our efforts, we
have a Chinese Finger Trap.</p>

<p>$) Listening to the music through the walls like we did seemed a
lot like living in the dorms.</p>

<p>I almost fell asleep sitting up before I thought of number 5.  Good
night.</p>

<p class=date>10:56am CST Saturday 1 February 2003</p>

<p>Some people didn't arrive who I had hoped to see: Ricky Shaw, Jason
Fricke, Erika Stuebing, anyone in my I-group..  I hope they didn't get
lost; part of me feels guilty like maybe I could have given them
better directions or I should have had a cell phone number they could
call.  Well, that was my feeling last night.  Today I'm like fuck
that; everyone else got there okay, including Rie who cannot yet speak
uber-fluent English.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>%) Steve McLeod describing his technique of money between friends.
He never loans money to anyone.  Only gives it, and expresses that
clearly.  That way he never gives more than he can give, and he never
loses a friend over the gift.  Wonderful wisdom.</p>

<p>^) Getting to see Joannah of Night With Joannah fame from my old
ultimate days.  I never joined the group for a Night With Joannah, but
it was cool to have her come to one of my parties to make it an NWJ.</p>

<p class=date>10:19pm CST Monday 3 February 2003</p>

<p>&) Maggie loves Joannah's smile.  It makes her gasp each time she
sees it.</p>

<p>*) Maggie threw an overhand huck to the endzone on a 10 count in
ultimate.  When Joannah was all alone in the endzone to catch it for the
moral victory of the season, Maggie ran up to her, hugged her, spun
her around for joy.  Maggie might have a bigger crush on Joannah than I.
PS Maggie doesn't know that she wants this public.</p>

<p>() Mark Leonard was there; he's the one that found the cool
days-old counter.  He was wearing a fly silk shirt from Brazil I
think.  He told us about being captain of an ultimate team in Italy!
Like, he's the captain now because he says this league is the best in
the world and the team was awesome but no one would step up as captain
so he's doing it.  Amazing.</p>

<p>)) Eric and Meredith were there though I didn't get to talk to
them too much.  Meredith had changed in the car before arrival.
Meredith heard that I'm putting all or most of my expenses on credit
card and she was all, "as your financial advisor, I encourage you
<em>not</em> to do that, but you'll do whatever you want, I know."
She's looking way fitter and trimmer!</p>

<p>_) All my parents where there, starting with Ma and Jon who were
relatively early arrivals.  I didn't really talk to them too much,
though Jon filmed me telling the story of the time I followed Marcel
and Kayse around on one of their first days hanging out until Marcel
was all, "um.. we're going to hang out alone..."  " ... Oh!!".  Good
times.  Dad and Karen were there, and I made it around to them just as
they were leaving.  Told them about my latest Japanese news.</p>

<p>~+) Daniel was there; he gave me a cool little silver ring with
smiley face on it and a card.  Good to see him; he's looking fitter
and trimmer!  Oh and the cool thing is that he's up in Dallas on
occasion and may come visit me before I fly out.</p>

<p>~!) Our servers (not mail servers, but female servers) were Tami
and Elizabeth.  Roger L Jackson Jr was the first guy who helped set
stuff up.  Charles Chkaiban was the general manager.</p>

<p>~@) Phat Pat had a funny story about a store not accepting as valid
a temporary ID card, because he was wearing a jacket that said Mark on
it.  "So you're going to trust a <em>jacket</em> more than a valid
Texas ID??</p>

<p>~#) Anna drew mightily on the book and on the tablecloth.</p>

<p>~$) Nick drew an awesome brain of cathodes and vaccuum tubes in a
head.  Rie drew a page of Japanese text that I cannot yet read.  Jerry
drew a cool pic depicting the UH ultimate field with him hucking a
disc long to me.</p>

<p>~%) Jerry brought his friend Patty; it was cool to meet her.  She's
apparently been to some other ultimate type things.  He offered to buy
me a beer or something and the offered to buy me a game downstairs,
but I never left the party while he was there to let him do it.</p>

<p>~^) Maggie loved Phat Pat's suggestion box story!  I think Maggie
loves stories so much that she should hang out with Pat some and hear
lots more.</p>

<p>~&) Nathan and kT came; it was great to see them.  Didn't *really*
get to talk to them, but they were part of Silent Football at the end
of the night.</p>

<p>~*) Maggie, kT, Nathan, Tina, Pat, Nick, Fred, Kristen, Catherine,
Rie, Joannah, and I as dictator played Silent Football.  (Yay Maggie for
remembering the order!)  We started out with normal names, but soon
Nathan turned to "Mr Slouchy" and Pat turned to "Mr I'm a Moron" and
Nick became "Reverand Nick."  Then Nathan sat up straight and became
"Mr Vertical" and Fred became "Mr Slouchy."  Then when Fred and kT
were tossing the football back and forth relentlessly I put a wormhole
between them to stop that madness rather quickly.  Then Fred moved the
football to himself about 10 or 15 times in a row.  Maggie said Maggie
was impressed with how well Fred played with himself.  Nick expressed
that Fred's playing with Fred's self was sinful and vile, and an
insult to the sacred universee.  Nick was rather dismayed with the
wormhole in general; he hadn't played a game with one in it yet.</p>

<p>~() After Catherine and Kristen left, Joannah did what she claimed
to be the correct version of the Roger Rabbit for us after having
Shrugged a Schrodem.  Kristen had done it a couple of times during the
rules, which might explain why she didn't really know how to play.</p>

<p>~)) At one point, Reverand Nick said horseshit as the finale of
some complaint.  Maggie was all, "Mr Dictator, where in the bible is
there a reference to horseshit?"  me: "Reverand Nick, will Reverand
Nick please quote the bible verse containing the term
'horseshit'?"</p>

<p>Of course, Nick did this flawlessly, in a most hilarious manner!
If only a recording of it had been made.  Hmmm maybe hypnosis could
get it back.</p>

<p>~_) Rie and Joannah did a fantastic job playing for their first
times.  Pat coached Rie a lot at first, which is most of what Nathan
complained about, or at least a great deal of it.</p>

<p>!+) I'm talking to Maggie now about possibly starting a Pick Up
Silent Football game.  Oh my gosh Maggie is the <em>best!!</em></p>

<p>!~) kT brought me a white chocolate Kit Kat!  Oh wait, that was at
Houston Rally.  Good to see her again so soon!</p>

<p>!!) Kristen and Catherine notarized a statement in the book that
they had been to my party.</p>

<p>!@) Someone did a Zoom a Zoom Zoom dance, and someone else did a
Fwap a Fwap Fwap dance, but we can't remember who they were.  Nathan
refused to do Little Bunny Foo Foo so he I had him do it in sign
language.</p>
