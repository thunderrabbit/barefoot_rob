<p>new game</p>

<p>neat-o keen, i can make new paragraphs</p>

<p>names! Happy Shrugs a lot, mr. Super duper, love parade, fro-daddy,
the crazy swede, master shake, the lord almighty god, she, mr. square
wheele, ismay eezeldway, i am cat woman, najla, Super Jesus, tiki
master, your mom, mr. bobolina mr. bob dabolina, Mr. Dictator.  </p>

<p>Conversation Probation!! haha</p>

<p>Mr. dictator did not revoke free speech but tipping the hat revokes
it, so... yeah, he formally revoked it. </p>

<p>issmay eezeldway said sayanara. she's gone. </p>

<p> happy shrugs a lot asked for free speech,. mr. dictator gave her
15 words, she said "fuck, nevermind!" [Mr Dictator replied something
like, "excellent!" referring to the low word usage.] quite funny. </p>

<p>i am cat woman shrugged a shrodem and mr dabolina mr bob dabolina
looked at the computer twice and still got her name wrong. super Jesus
tried to correct him, but didn't know mr. dabolina mr bob dabolina's
name and he got i am cat woman's name incorrectly as well. When
mr. dictator cleared up I am cat woman's name, mr dabolina mr bob
dabolina goes "that's what i said!"  she called mr dictator sir
tallywhacker tator tot. "quote dot dot dot end quote." </p>

<p>"mr dab dabba fuckin'..." -najla 
<br>najla said him and then realized
it and said it again, and then said "fuck you. ...FUCK!" all after
getting mr dabolina mr bob dabolina's name wrong immediately after
being told what it was. bob here is singing the mario brother's
song...</p>

<p>"Most people have number, i have word. I dont' have a phone
number, i have a phone word!" -Pat</p>

<p>fro daddy shrugs the crazy swede's football and she looks at him
for a while and goes "oh!" Happy shrugs a lot gets 15 words to explain
what happened and the crazy swede gets 1/2 a penance point for not
noticing the first shrug.</p>

<p>master masturbation tool master!!!!! hahahahaa</p>

<p>mr dabolina mr bob dabolina gets 1/2 a penance point for talking
out of turn, being a nuisance out of turn, talking to the president
out of turn, etc! </p>

<p>Najla forgot her own name!!</p>

<p>Somebody said it and your mom pointed it out without
quotes. Mr. dictator said "ironically, so did Your Mom." </p>

<p>Super Jesus can't get himself out of pronoun troubles.</p>

<p>lord trojan-wearing tator tot.</p>

<p>najla forgot her name... damn it, DAMN IT! - Master Shake </p>

<p>fro daddy requested a penance point check and mr. dictator said
that fro daddy had one penance point.</p>

<p>penis points "I'd just like the universe to know that i have 100 of
those..." -love parade</p>

<p>that's about quote it.</p>

<p>can you imagine if Jay and Silent Bob played silent football? "What
the fuck is a pronoun?" much laughter.</p>

<p>There's now a wormhole between mr dabolina mr bob dabolina and
master shake. whee. Master shake will apparently also be recieving mr
dabolina mr bob dabolina's (who will now be referred to as 'bob' due
to frequent refernces to him) phone calls. </p>

<p> Master asshole i mean master shake... najla's cell phone is
permenantly on. no power button. discussion of cell phones. </p>

<p>najla got 50% of a penance point for signing "fuck you" (middle
finger) where you is a pronoun.</p>

<p>When one end of the wormhole walks away, the worm hole does not
exist anymore.</p>

<p>bob refferred to mr super duper as "that kid over there" when tattling.</p>

<p>my knee itches. a lot. a whole lot. exactly one shitload.</p>

<p>mr super duper asked for permission to speak in latin. permission
denied. he was told to just do it.</p>

<p>little bunny foo foo hoppin through the forest and then he had a
aheart attack and thats the end of the song. </p>

<p>love parade's hair is now a seperate entity. there is a one way
wormhole between love parade and his hair. So stuff goes to his hair first</p>

<p class=date>5:28am</p>

<p>This game is getting pretty fucked up.  People are falling asleep
and talking out of turn and being general nuisances.</p>

<p class=date>5:33am CST Sunday 19 January 2003</p>

<p>Okay, Calder is dictator now.</p>

<p>"Can I have a wormhole?"</p>

<p>Adrianne: "Can I have a worm?"</p>

<p>Skyler's name is "I sell sea shells by the sea shore."</p>

<p>"Mr Super Duper is awarded 1/16th of one penis point and 1/2 of one
penance point."</p>

<p class=date>5:39am</p>

<p>I'm getting pretty tired.  Everyone is.  Fwaps are going crazy.</p>

<p>zzzzzz</p>
