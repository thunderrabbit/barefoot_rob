<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<p><ul>
<li><b>~</b> I&rsquo;ve been living at Bibby&rsquo;s house in Dallas for the past some
months.</li>
<li><b>!</b> I&rsquo;ve driven on my eastern state trek, as far east as western West
Virginia, and as far north as southern Michigan.</li>
<li><b>@</b> I&rsquo;ve driven on my western state trek, as far west as western
California (Santa Monica, LA, Newport Beach) and as far north as
Eugene Oregon to see Dude and Veronica.</li>
<li><b>#</b> I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to attend San Antonio Rally since I&rsquo;m not an
official advisor at a church.  This reason seems fishy, and I feel
like I&rsquo;ve been individually targetted, but I&rsquo;m pretty much over it.
Shit that was back in October so I oughta be over it.</li>
<li><b>$</b> My final planned Rally is Houston, which will be over in less than
one week!!!!  Holy shit that is amazing, exciting, scary, tragic.
YRUUers are still in my dreams every night; I&rsquo;m going to miss advising
a lot.</li>
<li><b>%</b> I&rsquo;ve been &ldquo;invited&rdquo; to the last half of Houston Rally.  I&rsquo;m
thankful for this; I&rsquo;m glad I was able to negotiate my way into
attending the best part of the rally (Saturday night to closing
circle) which will certainly include hella Silent Football!</li>
<li><b>^</b> But the wizack thing is that it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s a big deal being
made about when I get to attend the rally.  The rally is for the
youth, and to only allow me to attend <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> of it kinda puts a limelight
on me that shouldn&rsquo;t be there.  Just let me attend the whole operation
and allow the youth to just be themselves and do whatever they do.</li>
<li><b>&amp;</b> I&rsquo;ve officially been offered a job to teach in Japan!  I called
Brian at the San Francisco office a couple days ago and he confirmed
it.  They had sent an acceptance thing to my old address on 9
December.  It apparently was not forwarded to my dad; ohhhhh.. is it
only a 90 day forwarding thing?   180 days?  It&rsquo;s close to that now.
Anyway, whatever.  They are sending it to me here in Dallas and I
should get it this coming week and I plan to send it back before
Houston Rally.</li>
<li><b><em></b> Because of the delay, I won&rsquo;t be able to go in February; March is
the earliest I can make.</li>
<li><b>(</b> Janette and i are tossing around ideas of traveling in February;
maybe a quick jaunt to Hawaii!!!!! but I&rsquo;m not 100% sure on finances.
A big part of me is like fuckit and just go and pay it all back when I
start bling blingin&rsquo; again from Japan.</li>
<li><b>)</b> I also wanna go see family in West Virgina again, specifically to
see Sarah (I&rsquo;ve felt bad for never coming back to play with Shane
between when I saw him at like 9 years old and then <em>bam</em> he&rsquo;s
suddenly 17 or some shit.)  Sarah is little, and she&rsquo;s still little,
and I&rsquo;d love to go for walks with her again.  Plus get to see Barbie
and her cute friend Elizabeth and go for longer walks with her.</li>
<li><b>-</b> Maggie has been planning my 12000th day party.  I&rsquo;ve sent emails
to some people to tell them to clear their calendar, but we don&rsquo;t know
where the party will be yet.  Looks like Jillian&rsquo;s will be it.</li>
<li><b>~=</b> I&rsquo;m basically inviting all my friends and all YRUUers who have
graduated.  If you wanna be on the invite list, email me <a
href="mailto:12000@robnugen.com">12000@robnugen.com</a></li>
<li><b>~!</b> I&rsquo;ve almost finished typing up the rules to Silent Football.</li>
<li><b>~@</b> I looked into ways of using CSS to create an ol.jackie class,
but this will have to do.</li>
<li><b>~#</b> I haven&rsquo;t worked for money since before my western state
trek.  I&rsquo;ve talked with Johnny to see if he has work for me.  He said
he may have some at his house, which I assume is not his farm way out
near Crawford, though that might be cool in a way to see what kind of
hick town the President came from.</li>
<li><b>~$</b> I don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;ll be in Japan; I don&rsquo;t know what
my life will be like in two months.  How wiggidy wack to think how
different it may be than right now, where everything is comfortable.
Where I know the language, where the street addresses are in numerical
instead of chronilogical order, where my old friends are close.  What
marvelous marvels will I encounter?  Will I be placed in Tokyo?  Will
I be able to easily connect my computer to hi-bandwidth internet, free
of charge?  Will I have an international cell phone?  (I do know I
plan to have a cell phone only and not a landline, even if a landline
is the only way to have internet access close by)  (I also know that
Japanese cell phones are miles ahead of ours in coolness and
technology, at least according to lots of stuff I&rsquo;ve read)</li>
<li><b>~%</b> I still have Scott and plan to give him to Janette as a
thank you for letting me sponge in her house for so long.</li>
<li><b>~^</b> I need to get Scott&rsquo;s oil changed.</li>
<li><b>~&amp;</b> I haven&rsquo;t heard from Kim Sawyer in a while, not since I
finished his website, except for an email he sent out to a bunch of
cats inviting them to attend one of his coaching classes.  I can see
therefore he&rsquo;s been busy, which explains why he hasn&rsquo;t really checked
out the site updater.</li>
<li><b>~</em></b> I need to start thinking about what I&rsquo;m going to take to
Japan.  I wanna take my bike, but I might have it sent over after I&rsquo;m
settled.  I apparently need to have some suits (!) to wear.  I&rsquo;ve got
two pair of fly shoes, and two suits (though I can only think of where
one of my suits is).  Not really enough white shirts, and I think I
have a cache of ties somewhere.  Maybe my suits are at Ma&rsquo;s in
Austin.  That would make sense.  I think I gave them to Fred to take
to her house just before SWUUSI</li>
<li><b>~(</b> I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;ll be able (allowed) to go to SWUUSI
next year.  I&rsquo;ll request the time off and apply; but overall I release
this to my higher power.</li>
<li><b>~)</b> I&rsquo;ve been keeping up with YRUUers Live Journals for some
time now.  Also with world news via Google.  I wonder how that might
change when I&rsquo;m overseas.</li>
<li><b>~-</b> I wonder who (from my current life) will visit me while
I&rsquo;m in Japan.  (This makes me wonder if I&rsquo;m going to Japan to see some
of my peeps from past lives; it makes sense that I am, but by &ldquo;current
life&rdquo; above I meant the people that I&rsquo;ve hung out with in the past
five years.)</li>
<li><b>!=</b> I wonder if I will or will not write a lot of letters out of
lonliness or excitement at so much great stuff.</li>
<li><b>!~</b> I can rap the lyrics to Eminem&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rabbit Run&rdquo; with or
without the music playing.  Without the music I can rap through it
almost perfectly faster than he does on the album.</li>
<li><b>!!</b> I wonder if I&rsquo;ll be able to watch current movies in
English overseas.</li>
<li><b>!@</b> I wonder how many women I&rsquo;ll get crushes on.  I&rsquo;m not
attracted to Japanese women <em>per se</em>, but I may just possibly
find some other cool world travelers there.</li>
<li><b>!#</b> I wonder how easily I&rsquo;ll be able to learn Japanese:
reading, writing, speaking, listening.</li>
<li><b>!$</b> I have a goal of becoming fluent in three more languages
(starting with Japanese) within 10 years.</li>
<li><b>!%</b> I look forward to coming back to US culture and having
the experience of not being able to remember the English word for
something.  Not an unrecoverable memory failure, but just that a
different language is on top of my brain for once.</li>
<li><b>!^</b> </li>

<p><p><b>Comment:</b>
<br> saw a reference to this in re-reading some of our old corresspondence.<br>
i love how big chunks of time and  experiences that will influence the rest of your lfe can be condensed into one or two items;  &ldquo;.! i&rsquo;ve driven on my eastern state trek&hellip;&rdquo; and &ldquo;.@  i&rsquo;ve driven on my western state trek&hellip;&rdquo;<br>
  i also remember how reading one item of this entry set off my insecurities and fear.  i was surprised and taken off guard. i didn&rsquo;t like the idea of you imagining, while you were still with me, all the women you would  have crushes on.  i acted out instead of saying how i felt straight up because i was embarassed and not sure i could voice such possesive and controlling desires  to you.  i was unsure of how to create boundries for myself.  what is asking too much of you?  how do i take care of myself without pushing you away?  stuff like that. it is something i still work on.<br>
 <br>

<br>
ok this tells me that the way to live a happy, exciting life is to say &ldquo;fuckit! i&rsquo;m going!&rdquo;<br>
  <br>
  we rock</p>
