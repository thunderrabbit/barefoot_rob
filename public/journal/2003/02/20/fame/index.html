                        <p class=date>4:34pm CST Thursday 20 February 2003</p>

<p>I just had an interesting set of brainwaves about fame and stuff.
I wonder how much this stems from a fear of being alone and not having
friends, or a fear of letting people down.. versus the excitement of
wanting to be famous and well loved and to create good and positive
things in the world.</p>

<p>I'm moving to Japan for a year.  There are some people with whom
I'd like to stay in touch.  (Janette, Wende, Maggie, etc) There are
some people who I fancy would like to keep tabs on what I'm up to.
(Dad, Ma, etc) There's a whole world of people and things for me to
see and experience and write about, to share those experiences with
other people that I don't know.</p>

<p>I could attempt to keep track of names and addresses, numbers of
letters written, who sent emails most recently, what everyone is up
to, ... really spreading thinly myself and my focii (emotional, physical,
mental energies).</p>

<p>I want to keep in touch with some people on real, legitimate,
shared communications, exchanging emails and letters.  I might call
these people my "friends."  There are some people who have been
friends with me and then things shift and we moved and graduated and
don't see one another as often.  (Gene, Dude, etc) Which of those
friends do I continue to contact?  How do I keep from missing any? (,
, , etc) How do I maintain contact information for them all?  Not
everyone checks email each day.  Not everyone has a snail mail
address.  Not everyone stays in one place forever.</p>

<p>There are some people (mostly women) that I "really want" to stay
in touch with, and find that I don't have the energy to keep up with
them all.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>As I first had this thought process rattling through my brain, I
came to a possible solution of keeping a list of snail/e mail
addresses and sending out snail/e mail updates of my adventures...  I
recognized this to be a form of pimping myself and a way to work
toward becoming famous.  How else does one
(product/person/service/website) become famous besides advertising?
It's either yammering word of mouth, billboards, TV spots, business
cards, doing something 'newsworthy', etc.  Being an interesting,
helpful or useful prodcut/person/service/website keeps people coming
back, increases word of mouth advertising.</p>

<p>So then I would become a self-aggrandizing cat walking around
trying to be famous, under the guise (?) of keeping in touch with
people.</p>

<p>Is that what I want to be?</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Ah, this is interesting.  It seems that *everyone* says, "drop me a
line, let me know how you're doing," etc etc.  And they often really
mean it:</p>

<p>!) They want to know how I'm doing
<br>@) They want to feel loved (by thinking I think of them)
<br>#) They like the way I write or tell stories
<br>$) whatever else</p>

<p>(But!) Not as many people who say "keep in touch" keep themselves
in touch with me.  I certainly say it more than I do it.</p>

<p>So do I come back to writing to those who actually write to me?
Keep track of who wrote what, when, how long, how carefully?</p>

<p>Of course it's not possible (not easily with current technology
that I have available) for me to keep track of all that, and it's
really not what I want to focus on.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>What I'd rather do is just run around and live my life climbing
waterfalls and telling jokes, meeting people and learning new ways to
shake hands, discussing music and learning new languages, inventing
new games and telling old stories, pouring my heart out and supporting
others in doing the same, kissing loving having sex and sleeping late
until hunger calls.</p>

<p>(( I'm going to Japan because I wanted to get a job combining youth
group leadership and overseas travel.  I contacted a company that was
all, "what in-country experience do you have?"  (Um, 2 weeks in
Australia?) So I figured if they want in-country experience, I'll
<em>move</em> to Japan, live there a year and call 'em back.  Teaching
English happens to be something that I seem qualified to do.</p>

<p>I know a million more doors will open as I'm living there.  I'll
hear about other countries I want to experience, other waterfalls to
climb, other sports to play, other music to create, other radio
stations to DJ, etc etc etc etc etc etc ))</p>

<p>This seems like it's on the right track for what I want to do, and
could certainly lead me to more waterfalls, people, countries,
languages, games, etc etc.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Optimally, I think everyone should take care of themselves:
physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually.  Everyone should
basically do what they want to do when led by love to do it.  The only
way I know to affect that in the world is to do it myself.  Do what I
want to do when led by Love as guided by god and my higher self.</p>

<p>So what do I do?  Write in my journal, transcribe old entries, be
down on myself for not doing more?  What the fuck is that about?  I've
traveled to Hawaii, enthusiastically told my waterfall story to
Colleen, listened to adventures in her life with open heart, loving
interest, caring soul.  These things are good for the world!  How can
I possibly think I've not done enough today?</p>
