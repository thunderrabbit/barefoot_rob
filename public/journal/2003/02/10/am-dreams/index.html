                        <p class=date>4:48am HST Monday 10 February 2003</p>

<p>a rooster is crowing across the street.</p>

<p class=dream>Janette and I were walking and climbed up a sand hill.
a bad guy came up behind us and a friend came up on the other side of
this hill.  I told the friend if the bad guy shoots at us, you run to
the cops. There were cops sitting in police cars not too far away.</p>

<p class=dream>The bad guy shot a nail gun at me and I blocked it,
ending up with a small pierce in my hand, but I started hollering like
"hey there's some guy with a nail gun!" and ran over toward the cops
and one came over and tried to diffuse the guy holding the nail gun.
I didn't have to prove he shot me; the cat had a nail gun and the cop
was stopping him for that.</p>

<p class=dream>The guy had a knife too and it took a few tries for any
of us (cop, Janette, me) to get him.  Finally I got him by his wrists
and woke up.</p>

<p>Earlier dream:</p>

<p class=dream>Driving with Jennifer Nunnaly from PT! over a bridge
under construction.  She had done it many times before, but I had not.
she was driving.</p>

<p class=dream>We got caught while on the bridge and she tried to
ignore them, navigate around all the consruction materials and get
down safely without being caught.  She put a strip of burlap over an
identifying feature of her car and we finally got down.</p>

<p class=dream>A guy found us and was trying to negotiate with us and
he said he needed a pair of white underwear so I was all if I give it
to you will you forget this ever happened?  He thought for a minute
and said he'll forgive all past events but if we go up again, that
would have to be dealt with at that time.</p>
