                        <p class=date>1:09am HST Saturday 15 February 2003</p>

<p class=dream>at dad and karen's house, and helping them put some
glass doors back into place which were supposed to be laying on some
metal rack thing but the rack was bent or something and the doors were
not laying just the way they should so I was trying to line them up
properly and a couple YRUUers showed up to help and they were all
putting some roof pieces on the doors but were doing it from top to
bottom which wasn't going to work so I got mad and left, or I told
them it was the wrong way and I wasn't going to wait around cause I
had already been working for a long time on it.</p>

<p class=dream>It was Tanner and Scottie with the roof tile things</p>

<p class=dream>I left and ended up walking into church where I didn't
want to be but didn't want to be rude and walk out so I stayed and it
was extremely unprofessional with people answering the phone during
the service nad the preacher referring to personal business of his own
as the daughter wanted to get a new car and was interrupting church or
something. and the church started singing Morning has Broken, which is
one of my favorite hymns so it coudln't be all that bad and they took
the offering and I drpped a dollar into the thing and then the next
usher had his hand out and it was ful of nice rocks, so I gave him a
nice rock out of my pocket.  it took a while to get my hand out of the
pocket cause it was tight.</p>

<p class=dream>I left church and was talking to some woman who thought
my son(!) was teaching english in Japn so I went with it and just led
her on as we were on the train going past buildings and such in tokyo
and I got off at a Shell station apartment building and tried to get
into the parking lot levels where cars were, basically just testing the
security of the building where I was supposed to be, but they didn't
know who I was yet, so I tried getting through different doors and got
through some but was never able to get anywhere that I could actually
reach a car or anything important, as I worked my way down the steps to
different levels.  got tot he ver bottom llevel and the cop was there
looing at me so I chose not to go back up and try again, but went out
frnto where there was a atter fountain and was walking along it and
found myself in the old west, with a bunch of guys, all mysogynists it
seemed who were living on a piece of landin the middle of the modern
world, but there idea of fun was to get catle across a big river, just
like in the old cattle drives aross the midwest.  some cattle had big
horns and some cattle each had one big horn sticing straight up, alike
a big phat horn fat like about 9 or 10 inhes in diameter, but kinda
square like the cows head and stiking straight up and arching
backwards.</p>

<p class=dream>The guys were all on horses and walking along the water
and then it was time to jump on the horses and go acrross so I got on
my horse bareback, though I had a saddlenorn around whcih I wrapped my
rope nad they kinda laughted at me cause the saddle norn was so
small, but they wrespected me since I was the new guy and just trying
to get into the middle of this whole thing</p>

<p class=dream>They were laughing about women's undergarments that had
been left on these railroad cars on the side of shore, and thewer serw
these were all panites and bras of these guys girlfriends or some
eomwon who were there now and I grabbed w Wende's panties and kept
them safe though I never saw Wende; I intenede to bring themb ack to
her once the rie was done. and some guys jokingly threw panties into
the river and laughted watching them go downstream.  I chose not to
recover all the panties since they might laught, and I didn't know
whose thery were anyway, but just watched them go dwonstream and
wondered abut hte karma between these men and their significant
other.s.  Then some woman pushed a bra into the river and then someone
put two small white shoes on two stacked purple pillows and pushed
those down the river.  The pillows came apart as tethey whoosed downt
he first waterslide like waterfall and one of the soes stayed on the
top pillowa dn the other shoe came off altogether and the wind was so
strong tha tthe shoe got bblown back up the waterfall and off the
river into the ocean a bit; the river was going paprallelto shore and
somhow they were staying distinct and the show breached the ga p
between river and ocean and then go blown back across nto the river
and tried to go down the waterfal again.</p>

<p class=dream>All this time I kept wende's panties stuck under my
crotch, jsust sitting on them so they'd stay safe from pranksters and
and safe from falling iinto the waater.  I got off my horse and some
tall guy who reminded me of Ivory from the wolf shop came up and
startied tauntingly pushing a phat blunt (lllit phat blunt into my
face all "i heard you dont' smoke the good stuff; try it" and I
knocked it out of his ahands and into the water and he cgot all mad
and I stood my groud, "I know that they must hav told you how I feel
about that, that's why I acted so aggressively cause you were pushing
it into my face taunthingly and I didn't appreciate it.  I appreciate
you respecting my dchoisess.  choice in this case."  and he did
respect my choice and e hugged and it was alll good.</p>

<p>This dream happened about 4am:</p>

<p class=dream>Inside a shopping mall, there was a display of slices
of cake, about 8 HUGE pieces like 18 inches tall and at least as long
and wide, solid chocolate cake with about 2 inches of icing on top.
The mall was just closing, so I helped some of the security guards
there pick up the cake; they were going to take it home - no use in
wasting good cake!</p>

<p class=dream>One of the pieces I stacked onto my wagon thing was
shaped like Texas.  It wasn't as thick as the others, but still novel
for its shape.</p>

<p class=dream>Having pulled the wagon of cake outside, I put it onto
their boat (small yacht) and then I saw Danielle Bartley running into
the mall looking for her dog!  I found her dog outside, a small
doberman, but she came out with a little black Benji.  I said HI to
her and stuff, but she couldn't give me her phone number or
anything.</p>

<p class=dream>She wanted to drive my car, a kickin black Ferrari and
I let her cause I figure hey, it's just a car.  We couldn't get the
garage door opener to work to get out of the parking garage but she
knew a back way to get out and drove backwards to get out of the
garage.  We ended up in a place near her house and equally near where
I wanted to go so we left the car there and each walked home.</p>
