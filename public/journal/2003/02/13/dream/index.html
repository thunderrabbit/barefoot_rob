<p class=dream>I had to get up to go pee, and I figured I could just
go back to the little bathroom and pee but when I got there it had no
walls, so I used a sleeping bag to cover me while I was there.  But
there was no way to hang the sleeping bag from the ceiling anymore,
and I was surprised that I hadn't thought this through a bit more
completely; when I got up to pee it seemed like everything would go
smoothly, that all conditions were accounted.</p>

<p class=dream>Once I was there, some guys were sitting near a stack
of firewood discussing grades in their college classes.  One cat was
talking on a cell phone telling his friend on the other end of the
conection how the school the friend was attending was a really
difficult school in history so he should feel fine about geting a 3.5
in history class, but the friend pointed out that he was going to
school for history and therefore he should get a better grade in that
class than all the others.</p>

<p class=dream>I just looked at the shapes of the logs of firewood and
wondered if they were all different lengths or if they were just
stacked not lined up.  I could only see one end of the logs as they
were stacked.</p>

<p class=dream>One guy asked me what I was looking at and I told him
and he was all, "no really, what are you looking at?" as if I could
not possibly be thinking about firewood lengths.</p>
