                        <p class=date>2:17pm HST Thursday 13 February 2003</p>

<p>So, there <em>are</em> thistles on Hawaii.  I got some in my feet
on the way back from swimming.  I barely missed going to yoga with
Janette and Reenie; Janette left a note, so it seems I probably got
here 15 minutes after they left.  I didn't really care about yoga, but
I do want to meet this cat who teaches it; Reenie said he channels
astrological readings and tarot amazingly well.  Cool beans, it sounds
like to me.</p>

<p>But I'll just be like Mike the Man from Mars and be content with
knowing I'll meet the guy when the time is right.</p>

<p>After mailing off my postcards, save two (one actual Hawaii
postcard to Wende to make sure the free advertisment-postcard from San
Francisco gets to her first, and one to Karen cause I dated it 14
February), I decided to go swimming in the rain.  I figured no better
technique to get wet than to get wet two different ways at the same
time.  At first it was cold, but I got used to it.</p>

<p>Walked along the beach and saw in the not so far away distance some
waves crashing boldly on some rocks that stick out from shore.  I made
that point my goal.  I wasn't able to rock hop very quickly, since
everything was wet, even the rocks that don't (often) get wet from the
ocean; I could really only rock walk, stepping carefully to ensure I
didn't come back with scars.</p>

<p>Made it to the start of those rocks and discovered they were pretty
slick enough that I had to be really careful walking on them, and
sometimes was on all fours like Golem, except not as skinny.  Scared a
couple of crabs, a fish, and touched one of the brown with little
white spots water slug things, eeeeekk!! It was like an old warm
cucumber that slowly slugged away from where I touched it.  With some
delicate balancing, I made it out to the outermost point of rocks.
They sorta made a 3/5 pi arc out into the water.  I wanted to complete
the arc instead of coming back the way I had come and found myself
sorta stuck, having run out of rocks that remained visible at all
times.</p>

<p>I'd wait for the wave to go by, then step down into the water and
back up to the next visible rock.  Another wave, step down, step up.
Then I ran out of rocks that were visible at all.  A slight backtrack
gave me a few more feet, but not much help cause they were parallel to
shore.</p>

<p>I stepped onto rocks that were always covered in water; I could
barely see them because mud from the shore was being washed by the
rain into this small bay.  Then I noted I could see no more rocks at
all.  The next step was into a visual void that I knew had rocks at
the bottom, all of various heights and sharpness and organic coverage.
I realized I was scared.  <em>I'm afraid, why am I afraid, why am I a
slave to this trade, cyanide I spit to the grave, good enough to rile
you up, you want me to flip it, I can rip it any style you want.</em>
Fine.  I'm afraid.  I can either sit here and be afraid or go go go.
What's the worst that could happen?  Slice my foot open?  Fine.  I
won't die.  Let's go.</p>

<p>So I sat down on my rock, lowering my feet into the opaque water.
Felt rocks about 3 feet deep.  Fine.  Step, step, step.  "Rabbit Run"
lyrics in my head to focus on something else.</p>

<p><em>Some days I just wanna up and call it quits</em> step step
<em>I feel like I'm surrounded by a wall of .... rocks</em> stub ow
fuck step up onto a rock <em>everytime I go to get up I just</em> step
have to use my hands to keep balance <em>fall in pits my life's like
one great big</em> water pushes me over and I stub the fuck out of my
toe, trying to keep balance, splashing backward frantically to stay
upright and not have to put my hands into the unknown <em>bowl of
cherries</em>.</p>

<p>Fuck this style of writing.  Short version is that I almost ate
shit a couple of times and rocky terrain varied from waist deep to
shin deep without warning and finally near the end of the song I was
on all fours again cause I was near the shore and could see the rocks
and then triumphantly stepped up onto the usually-dry rocks on shore
as I recited <em>if I have half a chance I grab it</em> and I lost
balance and had to rotate 180 degrees and step down and then sideways
and then got stable again <em>rabbit run.</em></p>

<p>Four paw drive up the rocks to the street level.  I ran down the
half asphalt, half pothole street that would have been hellaciously
painful many times if I had stepped into the potholes containing
opaque puddles full of rocks and craggly asphalt.  Even worse would be
to step halfway into a pothole, where asphalt would have a good chance
to shred the arch of my foot.  It was only slightly painful stepping
on basically flat asphalt as I hit only some small rocks with my
tenderized feet.  Spitting "Rabbit Run" lyrics again, spitting not
cause I was reciting them quickly, but because it was still raining
quite effectively and I had water pouring down my face, I ran for a
while on the asphalt, basically avoiding the painful stuff.  Had to
slow down for a bit and then ran again when I got to some grass.</p>

<p>That's when I discovered thistles do live in Hawaii.</p>

<p>Ow fuck fuck fuck; I tried to keep running, but couldn't override
the stabbing pain each time I stepped.  Many of the stickers didn't
make it through my callouses, but those that got the tip of my toes or
that soft skin between the pads of my toes and my feet... yeowza!!  I
pulled them out, got thistles in my fingers, pulled <em>them</em> out,
stepped again, got more thistles, fuck.  I somehow made it out and got
basically everything cleared out of my footses and ran most of the
rest of the way home on the asphalt street.  This portion of street
was new and flat with some rocks on it.</p>

<p>Back to the hostel and saw the car was missing.  Sigh.  I missed
meeting this yoga cat.  But.....  it's alll good in Hawaii.</p>

<p class=date>5:13pm HST</p>

<p>Janette got the yoga guy's card and he said he'd be glad to do a
reading for us.  Sweet.</p>
