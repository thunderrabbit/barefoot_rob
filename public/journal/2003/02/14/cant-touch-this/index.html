<p>I just added the monkey sticker to my computer.  He's so cute!  I
got him for my skate helmet, but he ended up here.  I'll see him more
often this way, and my helmet is running out of room for stickers.</p>

<p>Today we kicked it around the hostel and got some grub and then
Zach showed up 20 hours late, though he said he came three or four
times even though we claim we were here (painting toenails and reading
Tarot cards).  Anyway, he's alive and we're all glad for that.</p>

<p>He drove us to the end of the road on the west side, but the dirt
road at the end of the road was all flooded so we didn't go to the
beach there.  Drove back some and stopped arbitrarily on the side of
the road.  Climbed over the dune to the beach!</p>

<p>Janette played "don't get my feet wet!" like those little birds who
run away from the waves.  She was cute.  Zach and Reenie went for a
walk.  I found a spot where the waves reached sometimes and dug a hole
there, using the sand to build a wall around my hole.  During
construction my hole was breached about 4 times, but the water drained
away pretty quickly.</p>

<p>Once construction was complete, I had a hole big enough for me to
sit in with my legs outstretched.  I sang variants of MC Hammer's
"Can't touch this" including the finishing line "This is the beach
that... you can't touch."</p>

<p>Water got in anyway, once from the back, so I stacked up my back
wall a bit higher, and once from the front, for which I did nothing
cause I was hoping for more exciting water breaches.  I kept hoping
for a monster wave to come over like the end of Two Towers, but it
never happened before the others got bored/hungry and were ready to
leave.</p>

<p>I was quite coated in sand so I ran out into the ocean to rinse
off.  I had asked Janette to put sunscreen on my back, so the sand
stuck there quite effectively and was hard for me to reach and wipe
off.  I removed my shorts cause they had been sand logged, and there
were only like 2 other people on the beach for hundreds of yards.
Plus my undies cover more than a speedo.</p>

<p>The rental car is a sandbox now in the back.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>We stopped by a store labeled COLLECTIBLES for Janette to see if
they had anything she'd like to resell in Austin, but they were closed
when she tried to visit.</p>

<p>Listened to Jeff, the proprietor of Aloha Dude Internet Access, on
the radio; he was doing a Valentine's Day show, subbing for some other
DJ.  Jeff used to have a show on Saturday mornings at 6am, but quit it
after a year for obvious reasons.  Funny that one of the first things
he did was thank the folks at Aloha Dude Internet Access for helping
sponsor the show.</p>

<p>Back into our city (Kapa'a (*)), we stopped at a mexican food place
which was closed for 5 more minutes (open for lunch and dinner, not in
between) so Janette and I visited Cold Stone ice cream place, which
was the same idea as Marble Slab, but a lot more cheerful as the
servers would all sing a song every time someone put a tip in the tip
jar.</p>

<pre>
Cold Stone
You're at Cold Stone
The place for tutti fruity ice cream treats
When you put tips
In the tip jar
We'll sing in perfect harmony
</pre>

<p>Or something like that.</p>

<p>They also had one to the Hi Ho song of the 7 Dwarves and something
else.</p>

<p>I got a big ice cream cone of banana and cheesecake ice cream with
M&Ms.  Janette got coconut with macadamia nuts.</p>

<p>Then to the Mexican food place where BAÑOS is spelled with a tilde
over the O instead of the N, and the fish burrito is HUGE, and could
easily feed me four meals.  Janette and I split it and maybe finished
1/2 of it.  I put the burrito in a to go box, but it basically fell
apart and will be a lot like mush in the morning I'm sure.  But I'm
also sure I'll still be glad to eat it.</p>

<p>Janette and I walked back home to the hostel, stopping by a shell
store where she decided she could buy any of the shells for less in
Corpus Christi, home of Colleen Crotty.</p>

<p>I found a shell on the way home from there; maybe she'll be able to
sell it on the shell shelves of her shell store.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Went up to the roof to take a shower and discovered that the loud
door slam I had heard this morning or yesterday morning was not the
door slamming against its frame, but the door ripping off its hinges
and landing on the roof.  Whoooosh!</p>

<p>(*) Ironically Ka'apa is spelled with two a's in the front.  Irony is that I bitched abut misspelling banos.</p>

<br>tell janette to buy whatever shells she wants, b/c corpus beaches have few desirable shells to offer, and i havent seen any shell stores. also, i&rsquo;m very very jealous of you all for being in hawaii. it&rsquo;s the only state we have where we have to fly a quarter of the way around the world, over half of the entire pacific ocean to get to, and it&rsquo;s still part of our country even though it&rsquo;s hundreds of miles away. i think that alone is neat as hell. i had an urge to call you today, and remembered hearing a rumor about you being in hawaii, so i came to the holy journal of rob&rsquo;s life and low and behold you are in fact gone and away. how long have you been there/how much longer will you stay? you and janette are great friends, it makes me smile to read about your adventures together. tell her i play &ldquo;dont get my feet wet&rdquo; too. who wants wet feet for sand to stick to? icky x2.</p>
