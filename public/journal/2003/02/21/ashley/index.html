hi rob.

i have been online since like. 7:30 i read
livejournals. commented. made brownies (not online) and then i was
thinking about how i wished that pics from the rallies were
online. and i know they used to be but the website has been
kinda... abandoned. and then. i had this... *REALIZATION* :: rob's
website has pics on it. i'm not saying they're super recent or
anything. but they're still nice to revisit. so pretty much, for the
last hour and a half i've been looking at pictures and reading your
journal. i like to revisit things. but i like even more to revisit
things from other peoples perspectives. its great to be able to read
your own journal and remember but even better than that is to know how
the people who were with you for those great times felt too. i like
revisiting things from your perspective. its so positive. it makes me
feel all good :) i feel that thing that all yruuers eventually
feel. its kinda... i dunno. the first few rallies you go to you dont
know many people, but the more you go to the more people you
know. your list of friends grows. then at some point it peaks. you
dont realize it at the time. but towards the end of your high school
career you realized that you recognize less people at every rally. and
you realize the decline has been in progress, you just didnt notice. i
noticed my lack of familiarity at houston. seems like no one knew who
i was. i spent most of my time with tanner, scottie, hunter, paul and
steve f. but really MOSTLY steve. we joked about him being my
boyfriend. it was funny. hilly was way grossed out. its strange. when
the most people you know are advisors. not bad. strange. i know its
time. to go. i know that you know the feeling. the sense that you'd
like to stay forever, but its time. i kinda regret not playing silent
football more, but at the same time. i was REALLY bad at it. and uh. i
was always asleep when you played. it just seems like this strange
little group. non exclusive but at the same time. a definate
group. with people who are in it and people who arent (like me). i
kinda wanted to be in it. but sleep is really really cool. you were
definately always there for me. and i love you. and i appriciate
you. very much. i'm sure people tell you that. but i really really
mean it. not that they dont. just sayin. i DO. you were the only
person who ever said thank you to me. it meant a lot. i've done a lot
of things for rallies, yruu, yac that i was sure no one knew about or
noticed. not like i was bitter. or i wouldnt have done them if people
didnt say thank you. but acknowledgement is one of the most wonderful
things you can do for someone. even when they dont ask for it. and
especially in a private, one on one sort of way. that's always stuck
with me. you said "thank you for all you do for yruu" i never
forgot it. i always wanted to tell you that. you definately made me
smile at times when i didn think i could. more than once. i know i'm
not the only person who felt this way. i just want you to know. that
we know. we notice you. definately. no matter where you go your home
will be in the hearts of all the youth who you've touched, raised the
spirits of, helped, guided, or just made smile once or twice. you were
my first vision of what yruu and rallies were. you were in OKC one
morning after a rally or something. you introduced yourself to
me. talked to me for a minute. there was a group of you on your way
somewhere. but i remembered it at my first rally. where you and bryan
were the only people to talk to me. your contact with me was less than
your contact with a lot of other people. so if i appriciate you this
much. just think of how much they appriciate you. woa. i
mean. WOA. seriously rob. so pretty much from now on i expect you to
know that you're great. ok. not in that stuck up "i'm so great" sort
of way. but in that subtle wisdom that great people have where they
occasionally think "i am good. i help" like that. :) so. know. and
have fun.

your hugs were always the best.
thanks for the sunshine.
i love you.
