                        <p class=date>3:14pm HST Sunday 16 February 2003</p>

<p>Fuck.  I don't know why I feel so lost.  After we left Al's, which
part of me wishes I had before everything was finished, but he was
saying some shit like, "if every inch of your life has led you to this
point where you are at this moment, then there must be some reason for
being here." which of course applies to every moment.</p>

<p>So I started looking at the books in his library and settled down
with a comic version of Lao Zi's _The Art of War_ when Pete came back
and bang it was time to go.</p>

<p>So on the way back, I was like, "let's turn right and get lost" and
they were like okay and Reenie decided not to pretty quickly and I
felt sad that Janette was going to turn back too.  But she didn't, so
Janette and I walked more and then she said her hip was hurting so she
needed to turn back cause I was all, "I'm going to the mountain" which
was a joke since the mountain is a pretty fucking long distance away,
but truth is I didn't know how far I was going to go.  Janette was all
"ha well I better turn back" and she did.  Fair enough.  So I plodded
on, thinking I ought not turn back too cause shit I'd just be
following her, but what the fuck am I doing way out here in the middle
of fucking not no where but less than nowhere cause it's just a bunch
of houses without end and a damn mountain that I'll never reach and
nothing to see so I just kept walking, trusting there was some reason,
some something for me to experience in this moment, the final
culmination of all my life to this point.</p>

<p>So I kept walking and found that I could walk 120 steps with my
eyes closed, just straight along the sidewalk and adjusting when my
feet touched the grass.  Usually I only got to like 30 or 50 or 70
steps before I opened my eyes, but then I went like 70 and only peeked
then 50 more and looked up and saw a horse on a rope standing near the
sidewalk, which was about to turn (the sidewalk, not the horse); I
wonder how the turn would have felt to my feet; would I have trusted
them and made the turn without looking?</p>

<p>I talked to the horse without words, just stood there, sharing the
moment with him/her.  Horse didn't want to eat any grass; s/he just
looked sad, with a little callous on the face from the bridal, and I
considered releasing the horse, but didn't think I'd feel settled
about that, mucking with horse and owner karma and such.  So I blessed
the horse and continued on for some more steps, around the turn and
saw that the road didn't seem to plan to head toward the mountain
anymore so I got to an intersection, memorized the names of the
streets (and have forgotten them; silly Hawaiian names) and chose that
point to head back.</p>

<p>I counted my steps on the way back.  I let my brain just count up
to 100 at a time and then my fingers kept track in binary of the
number of hundreds.  I got back to Al's road at about 100000 (binary)
* 100 (decimal) steps.  Soon thereafter my left knee began to hurt.
1001000 (binary) * 100 (decimal) total steps to the hostel.</p>

<p>I almost got lost on the way back, misrecognized an intersection
where we cut across a road as the one where we did not cut across the
road, but before I errored, I correctly recognized a set of trees
beside which we had walked.</p>

<p>My knee was still hurting some, but I walked on grass as much as
possible.  Going down the crusty rocky pebbly hill was pretty tough
on my tenderized feet.</p>

<p>Got home to the hostel and remembered that Janette and I had
switched from our bunk to a room and I didn't know where the room was
so I couldn't just flop down and sleep or cry or whatever, and I
couldn't find a note left by Janette and no one was here except new
faces that I coudln't see and it just felt crappy.</p>

<p>I sat by Reen's bed and found the note Janette had left.  They went
to a beach I assume Reen, but Zach and Janette at least.  So I fucking
missed the beach trip in order to wear out my knee and see a horse
that wouldn't take my offer of grass and to see a mountain remain
unreachable in the distance, and to be lost in my own hostel.</p>

<p>What a poopy way to miss a beach adventure.</p>

<p>So now.  Oh and I couldn't find bread to eat and I just feel like a
big whiney pissy baby, helpless without my glasses and I'm pretty
pissed about feeling helpless and I just want to fucking avoid it all
by going to sleeeeep.</p>

<p>Or by eating a big giant chocolate bar and washing it down with
orange juice, but I just now already drank our orange juice and ate
some chocolate that I found in Reen's tub.  Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
fuck fuck this stupidness.</p>

<p>Kevin (I think) was chillin' on the hammock outside our room (I
learned from a woman named Rita where it is) and Kimberly and he were
singing songs of various genres and our room doors are the path from
the house to the hammock so the natural route is through our room to
the hammock.  Now everyone is gone from the hammock area so I am going
to close off the passage and make 'em use the back porch ramp.</p>

<p>Once I had arrived in the room, they asked before walking through,
but shit I wasn't going to say oh no now you can't walk through and
have to walk around the entire house to get off the porch.</p>

<p>I don't really know what would make me feel better, how I'll feel
reconnected with my higher self, with god.  I thought a long ass walk
on my own would do it, get away from everyone and I just find myself
wanting to be with them.  I think about going to the store to get food
and I feel too blind to do that.  Or going to do internet to upload
all these entries and I feel too blind to do that.  It's just fucking
pissy stupid that I should feel so lost without my full vision.  I
think that's what the shit comes down to; I can't see as well as I'm
used to and I feel anger/sadness about that.  Sigh.</p>

<p>Kevin (I think) told me there's an optometrist down the road.  If I
don't go down there to at least *try* and get something fixed, then I
have to stop pissing and moaning about it.  Fuck.</p>

<p>But I'm ...  I'm allowing..  I'm given the opportunity to overcome this
challenge right now.</p>

<p class=date>4:17pm HST Sunday 16 February 2003</p>

<p>Called an optometrist who's vaguely close, but who is not within
walking distance exactly, and who is not exactly open on Sundays, but
who had an after hours number and I reached his wife Sharon who tried
to be helpful, but I still need to get a ride over there.  Kevin,
James, Jessica, Karan all don't have cars; sigh.</p>

<p>I'm not really comfortable with hitchhiking if I can't see the
person into whose car I'd be stepping.</p>

<p>But the good (great?  dare I be so close to being happy?) news is
that there's a SUSHI DINNER tonight for $10 all one can eat sushi,
which is not exactly a bargain and 1/2, but maybe a great time with a
bunch of people and help the Jessica economy a bit.</p>

<p>I had another chocolate bar; I'm going across the street to get
OJ.. no I'm not; I'm going to sleep.</p>

<p class=date>6:02pm HST Sunday 16 February 2003</p>

<p>Janette just got back and guessed I walked between 4 and 5000
steps.  I haven't yet converted it from binary.</p>

<p>7200.</p>
