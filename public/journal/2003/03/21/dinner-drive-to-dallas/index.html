<p>Yammered it up with Fred during/after selecting a lot of CDs at his
house to rip once we get back to Dallas.  Got all the NIN & Tori Amos
that he has and I don't.  Plus a lot of others.</p>

<p>Went to Star Seeds to eat, for Freddo said it's a cool 24 hour
restaurant in Austin.  Funny funny stories talking about his days at
Stanford when people made remote controls shaped like cats and
airplanes and belts and beer bottle koozies to control a TV and flight
simulator and lights in a room and another TV.  Thing is, all the
remotes had to use the same signaling protocol, so the cat could
run the TV or the flight simulator, or whatever mix-n-match people
wanted to do.  Verrrry funny.</p>

<p>Also about this cat named Will who knew sports really well because,
for example, he would drive all over to different high schools'
football games, do a writeup on the game and sell it (to both sides),
allowing them to do whatever they wanted with it, so long as he could
sell it to anyone else.  He harassed this young couple at a bar, "do
you love her?  You should tell her you love her right now!  She's the
most beautiful girl you're ever going to meet, and if you pass this
up, you'll be kicking yourself the rest of your life.  And oh, she's
an engineer?  You'll *never* find another engineer as beautiful as
she," etc etc etc just being all loud and obnoxious.  Then he was all,
"I bet you're from San Antonio... and you went to Dullis High
School...."  and he was right.  "I've <em>been</em> to Dullis High
School and you look just like every other Dullis High School student
I've ever seen..."</p>

<p>Also talked about YRUU, including Aristasha, and made up new
variants:  (all in falsetto English accent)</p>

<p>thumbs up,
<br>wrists together,
<br>arms out,
<br>elbows together,
<br>shoulders back,
<br>chest out,
<br>bum out,
<br>knees together,
<br>feet together,
<br>toes out,
<br>head back,
<br>tongue out..</p>

<p>"There's not really any more bodyparts we can use," suggested
Fred.</p>

<p>And describe the action in two words.....  "Okay, put your left
thumb in your right ear and stick your right toe in the back of your
left knee, tilt your head like this.  Aristasha! Aristasha!
Aristashasha!!"</p>

<p>Fred just filled up 13.012 gallons after traveling 215.3 miles.

<p class=date>12:25am</p>

<p>Two cars just blew the fuck past us, one on each side.  Word problem:</p>

<pre>
The driver of a red Camaro traveling 70 miles per hour on I-35 North
between Austin and Waco at approximately 12:22am watches two vehicles
pass him.  On his left, a gray Honda, and 1 second later on his right,
a black Mustang.  The driver of the red Camaro watched the Honda for 7
Scooby-Doos until it passed an identifiable landmark.  8 Scooby-Doos
later, the driver of the red Camaro reached the same landmark.

What was the average speed of the gray Honda during the 7 Scooby-Doos?

Bonus: What would be the cost of a speeding ticket for the driver of
the Honda?

Extra Bonus: What color was the bear?

Super Extra Bonus: From what 80s television program did the driver of
the red Camaro get the idea to count time in Scooby-Doos?

Super Double Extra Bonus: on which side of the roof would the egg
fall?

Ultra Triple MEGA Bonus: what was the gas mileage of the red Camaro
for its previous tank of gas?

Bonus 2: How far ahead of the red Camaro was the gray Honda after the
first 7 Scooby-Doos?
</pre>

<p class=date>3:49am CST Saturday 22 March 2003</p>

<p>Home now.  I'm considering writing a State of My Life Address, or
at least starting one, that I intend to send out before I leave.</p>

<p>Shit, I gotta do my taxes, buy pants, shirts, undershirts,
shoes.... and then pack.  But other than that I'm completely
ready.</p>
