<p>It seems that I've got my biological clock synched up enough with
Japan that I'll be allllll good.</p>

<p>Cookie brought me and Andrew to the train station (I forget the
name) and Fiona (another (ex-(?))instructor) met us and she led me to
my hotel.  I'm totally staying in a hotel for three nights and will be
met here by AdrienneG on Sunday I think to take me to my
apartment.</p>

<p>My bags will be brought to the apartment by ABC, the courier in the
airport where everyone dropped off their stuff.</p>

<p>Fiona is from Australia, though I first guessed South Africa, New
Zealand, and Britain before she politely said, "you're missing a big
island in the middle."</p>

<p>"Australia?"</p>

<p>I dropped off my bag in my hotel room, which is pretty small.  A
bit smaller than a motel room might be in the US.  And it's got a
bidet toilet thing.  Whoah.  And a super deep bath tub!  Like fully
two feet deep.  Hey, maybe it just looks deep cause it's so short.
Nevermind.</p>

<p>Um, oh, then Fiona showed me to the building that contains the NOVA
Headquarters for Eastern Japan.  They're based in a 30 story building
shaped like the Hyatt Regency in downtown Houston (rooms on perimeter
only, huge 30 story tall empty space in the middle) with restaurants
on the top two levels.  I walked around until someone greeted me
helpfully and I spent 1440 yen ($12) on five different types of sushi
(one piece each) and water.  The cat gave me a free coke.</p>

<p>Each piece of sushi... oh wait they were cooked... anyway, they
were each on a little skewer.  I put the skewer back on the tray from
which they were being served and the cook told me in Japanese (and
showed me in kinesthetics) that they go into the gaping mouth of the
ceramic frog sitting up on the counter.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Got a bit lost on the way back to the hotel (I went out a different
entrance and ended up walking underground about a block, so I didn't
know which way I was going relative to where I had been) but made it
back.  Oh, and that was after I went to the NOVA office and the
Japanese girl didn't understand me, "I'm just exploring; I don't need
any help," and ended up getting Fiona for me.  That was a bit
embarassing; I don't want Fiona to think that I'm a big fat baby, but
I explained to her what happened and asked her a question anyway:
where is the nearest internet cafe?</p>

<p>Found out, came back to the hotel to get my computer, decided
fuckit I'm too tired.  Though it doesn't seem like it's possible, my
calculations say that it's been 24 hours since I left Dallas.</p>

<p class=date>10:19pm JST Thursday 27 March 2003</p>

<p>If I'm 15 hours ahead of Dallas, then it's 10:19am minus 3 hours =
7:19am CST Thursday 27 March.  I've been awake a long time; I'm going
to sleeeeep.   Tomorrow = Get My Alien Registration Day.</p>
