<p>March 4, 2003
To Robert Nugen</p>

<p>Robert, our current information from the SF Office is that you will be
arriving at Narita on Thursday March 27 on UA 897 at 16.00.</p>

<p>The following information aims to guide you through the various stages
of your arrival, from immigration formalities at Narita until you
arrive at your accommodation.</p>

<p>There are two terminals at Narita. Your flight is due to arrive at
Terminal 1. Most flights will park at the gate, but there may be a bus
ride to the terminal in some cases. If you are arriving at Terminal 2,
depending on where your flight disembarks, there may be a short
shuttle train ride to the main airport concourse.</p>

<p>The first thing you will need to do at the airport is to go through
Immigration formalities. You will need to show your passport and the
landing card that will have been distributed during your flight. If
you do not have a completed landing card there are some available in
the immigration lobby. There are 2 sets of booths, one for Japanese
Nationals and one for Foreign Nationals. UNLESS you are entering Japan
on a JAPANESE passport (or have a RE ENTRY PERMIT to Japan in your
passport) then you MUST go to the booths for Foreign Nationals.</p>

<p>Once you have completed Immigration formalities you need to go to the
Customs Hall. Each carousel will have a display showing which flights
it is processing. Collect your luggage then make your way to the
Customs Officers. As in all international airports you need to go
through the green channel if you have nothing to declare and the red
channel if you do. You will need to show your passport again and your
luggage may be inspected.</p>

<p>After you have cleared customs you need to proceed with your luggage
into the Arrival Lobby. This is where our staff will meet you. We aim
to have our staff at the point where you emerge into the lobby. They
will be carrying Nova signs and should be easy to spot. If, for some
reason you cannot immediately locate our staff, then please make your
way to the Meeting Point. In Terminal 1 the meeting area is an alcove
room with a sign in English set back just behind the large arrival
information board. In Terminal 2 if you are unable to locate our staff
please make your way to the ABC Luggage delivery counter and our staff
will meet you there.</p>

<p>If, after 20 minutes or so, you still havenít located our staff then
please call our office on 03 - 6688 - 4441. We will liase with the
staff at the airport who will then come and find you. Our staff may
also page you if they fail to locate you.</p>

<p>Once you have met up with our staff they will first take you to the
ABC Delivery Service to have your luggage delivered. Nova will cover
the cost of the delivery for 2 pieces of luggage. If you wish to have
extra pieces of luggage delivered you will need to cover those
costs. At present to have 1 piece of luggage delivered costs
1.800yen. ABC will not accept musical instruments for delivery, and
Nova is unable to cover delivery costs of bulky items, such as
surfboards or bicycles. ABC can usually guarantee next day delivery,
and in most cases luggage is delivered the following day. In your
case, as you will be staying in a hotel initially, we will arrange for
your luggage to be delivered on the day you reach your permanent
accommodation. Please pack an overnight bag for your hotel
stay. Obviously, if you are using medication, please keep an adequate
supply with you to last until your luggage arrives at your permanent
accommodation. If your luggage fails to arrive by the time stated by
ABC, then please call our office and we will check with them as to its
whereabouts.</p>

<p>Once your luggage has been delivered there will be time to change
money, have a smoke or get something to eat or drink. Our staff will
hand you your &ldquo;arrival pack&rdquo; and go over its contents with you. They
will also explain how you will travel to your accommodation from the
airport.</p>

<p>There is usually some waiting time before leaving the airport for your
accommodation. The length of this wait depends on the number of
recruits and how many different flights they are arriving on. We aim
to keep waiting time to a minimum, but there may be occasions when a
longer wait is unavoidable.</p>

<p>As your accommodation will not be ready until March 30, you will be
spending the first 2 nights in a hotel. We aim to put you up at the
Shinjuku Sun Route Hotel, although there is a small chance this may
change due to room availability. Our staff will buy tickets for the
journey to your hotel. Our staff will usually accompany you on at
least the initial stage of your journey. If our staff cannot accompany
you into Tokyo then you will be met en route before transferring to
your commuter train. At the end of your journey you will be taken to
your hotel and helped to settle in. Total journey times from Narita to
your accommodation range from 60 minutes to 3 hours. If you encounter
any problems en route you can call our office on 03 6688 4441. You
will be helped to transfer to your permanent accommodation on the
30th.</p>

<p>Finally, if your travel plans change in any way, please notify your
Overseas Office immediately. They will inform us of your new
details. We will then be able to send out updated arrangements to you.</p>
