<h1>State of my Life Address</h1>

<p><center>or</center></p>

<p><center><b>now you know what time it is with all my stuff</b></center></p>

<p>(~) Today I recognized that in a month my life will be somewhat
different than it has been in a while.</p>

<p>(!) I'm living at the Bibby's house in Dallas.  Have been for some
months now.  Have had fabulous fun with Janette, reading, walking,
laughing, joking, talking, exploring, romping, chowing, etc etc
etc</p>

<p>(@) Josephine is getting way better at driving; we'll be taking
Scott out again today probably.</p>

<p>(#) I've still got my car Scott, but I'll be giving him to
Josephine soon soon soon.</p>

<p>($) I have my address in Japan!  It's
<pre>
Bell Wistaria #101
1-26-6  Tarumachi
Kohoku-Ku,  Yokohama-Shi
Kanagawa-Ken  222-0001
</pre></p>

<p>(%) I've written to my two new flatmates (Matthew and Frank) to see
if I can bring any scarce-in-Japan items for them, or if there's
anything I should bring for myself.</p>

<p>(^) <a href="/images/hardware/laptop/PowerBook_G4/computer_monkey.jpg"><img
src="/images/hardware/laptop/PowerBook_G4/thumbs/computer_monkey.jpg" align=left
border=0></a> My computer is an Apple Powerbook G4 with 677 MHz
processor, 256 megs of memory, 30 gig hard drive, wireless card,
gigabit ethernet, firewire, 2 USB, plus other ports I don't use.  Its
battery carries it for some (3-4) hours if I'm not using the CD drive
(CD read/write & DVD reader).</p>

<p>(&) the computer sports a "Medicare Waiver Not Required" stamp and
smiley face stamp on the outside cover, gold glitter glue at the
bottom of the screen (front and back), blue stripes above the keyboard
and below the monitor, and a cute monkey sticker to the left of the
touchpad, and bananas to the right.  Oh and scratches on the monitor
from potato chips at SWUUSI 2002.</p>

<p>(*) I've just editted my first image with GIMP on my computer.
Took a bit of doing, but I was able to rotate it, resize the canvas,
and make a thumbnail.</p>

<p>(() Just got a call from my dad who is flying to West Virginia for
Cordie's birthday ... I wanna go too; I've had it in the back of my
mind that I want to go see them (especially Sarah, before she grows up
like Shane did)</p>

<p>()) I've been wearing contacts since a couple days after losing my
glasses Hawaii.  I've ordered some cool new flexible frame glasses
that will be in before I go to Japan.</p>

<p>(-) I'm pretty much behind in reading livejournal; I've reduced the
number of people on my friends list a lot, but I'm still behind;  I
might just give that up altogether for a while.</p>

<p>(~+) I've been working at the Wolf Shop recently.  Got a full 6
days work in last week, then 2 days off and now the weekend off, but
will work again on Monday and hopefully will work steadily until I
need to split overseas (or to WV)</p>

<p>(~~) I've not really been practicing hiragana all that much, and I
don't yet know a way to edit hiragana with emacs (which I use for
writing my journal entries).</p>

<p>(~!) I've received information from Nova about what to expect when
I arrive in Japan.  It's vaguely interesting, and mostly predictable,
but I'll put it up here cause it's the only snippet of an idea of what
it will really be like that I've got.</p>

<p>(~@) I now know how to insert with SSI the navigation on the top of
static pages on my website.  Now I have a WTF section of my site,
though it's not complete yet.  I'm considering adding etcetera next,
and silent football under that.  Plus a bunch of other shit like KTRU
CD reviews, my random philosophizing, and maybe my portion of a
novel.</p>

<p>(~#) I've added some pics to my site.  Journal entries from 10, 11,
18 February 2003.  The 11th and 18th are the best pics of waterfalls,
and the 10th is a pic of Janette, Reen and me.  Yay GIMP!</p>

<p>(~$) It's now 10:47pm.  My whole idea on this started when I
realized my life would soon be way different.  I considered sending
out a mass email to everyone detailing what's up with me, and asking
people to reply back if they want to continue getting State of My Life
updates about once a month or so.  But now I think it's a dumb idea to
email everyone like that so I'm not going to do it.  Instead I'm going
to bed.</p>
