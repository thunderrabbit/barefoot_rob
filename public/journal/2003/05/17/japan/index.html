                        <p class=date>8:33am JST Saturday 17 May 2003</p>

<p>Guess what</p>

<p>I'm in Japan!</p>

<p>It just seemed to hit me, as I'm actually kinda sorta feeling
comfortable with most parts of my weekly routine.  I know what
triggered it; I got paid.  Or as Dude and I would put it, I got
paaaaiiiaaiiiiiaiiiid!</p>

<p>126,000 yen for a month and that's the lowest it should be.  Frank
thinks they took out too much rent and after two months I can add
40,000 yen that they won't be taking out for the advance, and I'll be
off probation etc etc.</p>

<p>So this smallest paycheck is $1260, all of which I can send home
because I've withdrawn enough to last the month until next paycheck.</p>

<p>It costs 2000 yen to send money home, and that seems to be the best
price around; I haven't done the research myself, but everyone I talk
to says yeah that's it.</p>

<p>BUT(!!) my bank reimburses up to $6? dollars per month for ATM fees
if I withdraw money from a different bank's ATM.   <em>Therefore</em>,
I believe I can call 'em up and flirt 6 dollars out of them for
the.....  uh oh I just thought of a problem.  I mean an opportunity
for more flirting:</p>

<p>If the 2000 yen is removed before my bank even sees the money, then
I have no proof of the fee.  But my bank can call Lloyd's and be all
yo yo what's the dealio and...  yeah.  It will be good.</p>

<p>I'm writing while riding the train (Nambu line from Musashi-Kosugi
to Kawasaki) and except for the train itself, it's silent.  Every seat
on the train is full, but no one is talking.  About 1/2 are sleeping
and about 1/4 are looking straight ahead with no apparent reaction to
anything they see, and about 1/8th are reading magazines, and about
1/16th are playing on their phones, 1/32 are listening to music, and 1
is typing on his computer.</p>

<p>My point: as I type while we're stopped at a station, each keypress
is the loudest thing occurring at the time.  Ooh now there are some
more people on and a few are talking.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Most train stations have music that plays just before the train
leaves the station.  This music certainly could be used to discern
from what station a train is preparing to leave, but by the time it
wakes a body up to get off the train, it's too late.  Maybe.  I dunno;
I'm still not sure why they play music.</p>

<p>But I do know that my favorite music is what they play when I get
off the train at Musashi Kosugi on the way home.  It's like a gentle
symphony compared to the hyper chords played at other stations.</p>

<p>We're at Kawasaki; gotta go.  Actually I don't quite yet, cause
there's going to be a mile long line (mob) going up the escalator. </p>

<p>Funny I can feel the train vibrate as people get off.</p>
