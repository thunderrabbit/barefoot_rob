                        <p class=date>10:00am JST Thursday 22 May 2003</p>

<p>Nice.</p>

<p>Quite a good challenge to find myself in Shinjuku, which Dru says
is the busiest station in the world.</p>

<p>Got to it.  Treating myself well today.  Got my own reclining seat.</p>

<p class=date>11:07am</p>

<p>Pause for a moment in Odawara, which is also available via a line
that goes through Kawasaki.  I wonder oh wow.  The station name for
Odawara is also written in Korean on this sign. I think it's
Korean.</p>

<p class=date>11:10am</p>

<p>Leaving Odawara.</p>

<p>I wonder what would be measurably different if I board this train
in Odawara.</p>

<p class=date>11:21am</p>

<p>Wow.  Two different track guages on the track beside us.</p>

<p class=date>11:37am</p>

<p>Holy shit!   The seats on my train, which I thought were so
permanent and stable, <em>turned around</em> for the return trip.  I
took a picture showing where the different guages merge just past the
station and as I walked back past my train, the seats were facing the
way from which we had just come.</p>

<p>Like Neo in the first Matrix: Woah.</p>

<p>And double woah is my train was the narrow guage.  And triple whoah
is all the beautiful forest and tunnels through which this larger
guage scenic train is climbing.   And quadruple woah is that there are
Japanese businessmen with briefcases and wearingsuits sitting in stony
silence beside me. Like they take this trek every day and are no
longer impressed.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Oooh, that was neat.  The train stopped at a small station and then went
backwards out of the station; the track is basically a bunch of
switchbacks going up the mountain.</p>

<p class=date>11:47pm</p>

<p>I escaped the train.  I've got no idea where I am.  Several people
got off and went down a steep hill, presumably to hotels and hot
springs and such.  Though I want to experience a hot spring, I prefer
to disengage from the crowds.  I'm going this way instead, on a small
trail through the trees, along the tracks.</p>

<p class=date>12:58pm</p>

<p>Breathe.</p>

<p>Basically I'm on top of a tall hill coated in trees.  I expected to
reconnect with the train at the top of the hill, but it seems that I
went far more quickly up than the train could.  I can hear activity
way way down below me, like the Grinch listening to Whoville, except
I'm way happier than the Grinch.</p>

<p>Encountered exactly two people on the path up here.  They were
going down instead of up.  But it seems they must have already hiked
up, since I'm at the top and there's no other way they could
reasonably have gotten here except walk.</p>

<p>Note: next time bring more water.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I love my life!  I just opened my bottle of water and the air
poofed out cause I'm at a higher elevation.  I'm reminded of the time
I went to the grand canyon and bounced <em>carefully(!)</em> on a
similarly over-inflated gallon jug on the icy parking lot!</p>

<p>And now I'm just smiling smiling that I have stories like
that!!!</p>

<p class=date>1:33pm</p>

<p>I just took a nap here on the top of the hill.  Birds sang for me.
Two people walked by without speaking.</p>

<p>I'm now going to contine on this trail, this time down, and
presumably I'll find the train again.</p>

<p class=date>1:56pm</p>

<p>Hmm.  So I wasn't at the top of the mountain. I have ascended
another 50 feet maybe and found myself at a T intersection: straight
and left were my options.  The kanji pointing left seemed more
interesting.  I'm at a sturdy plastic picnic table in a sort of
clearing.</p>

<p class=date>2:14pm</p>

<p>English voices coming up the hill behind me: Rondal, Lyndsey and
another name I forgot.  The guys are serving in the military for 3 and
2 years, respectively.  Lyndsey will be teaching English soon.</p>

<p>We had come from opposite directions and traded descriptions of
what was available.</p>

<p class=date>4:04pm</p>

<p>Whoooooooo</p>

<p>Walk walk walk</p>

<p>I <em>think</em> I know where I am.  If I understand correctly,
I've basically walked across this mountain.  I've come to a two lane
highway thing and I think I'm at a bus stop and I think if I get on
this bus I'll be taken basically back to the beginning of Hakone.  No
one nearby to ask.   The adventure continues!</p>

<p class=date>4:19pm</p>

<p>A bus arrived</p>

<p>Another bus arrived just as I was writing that.  The first bus
arrived and driver said my pass wasn't good for that bus.  I saw a cat
across the street who showed me on a map where we are.  I was
topologically (in terms of roadways) correct (of course) but had
guessed the wrong section of street.</p>

<p>The second bus that just arrived also said that the pass was no
good, and the next bu</p>

<p class=date>4:37pm</p>

<p>And then the *next* bus arrived, interrupting my typing, but it's
cool cause the cat who helped me navigate the buses helped me a bit
with Japanese and made sure I got on the correct bus, *<em>and</em>*
told the driver where I wanted to go.</p>

<p>For some reason (scheduling) we are just chillin' here in the bus
(we = me and the driver on an otherwise empty bus).  My friend is
yammering on his keitai and bid me adeiu in English.</p>

<p class=date>4:40pm</p>

<p>Bus still empty-ish and we're underway.</p>

<p class=date>4:43pm</p>

<p>Nice.  I've been deposited at the bus stop labeled Open Air Museum,
but I'm totally lost now - nothing here looks like what I thought that
might look like.  This is similar to when I got off the bus "near" the
bicycle pound.</p>

<p class=date>4:45pm</p>

<p>Yahooo!!  I found the museum thanks to "Picasso" written on the
sign. I had seen his name associated with museum ads.  The museum was
closed, so I didn't have to waste any time there.  I got some pictures
of a fly water fountain thing.</p>

<p>Hopped on another bus and went "950 meters" to Gora, where we
<em>turned around</em> on a little spinny thing!  wow!  And now.   and
<em>now!!</em> I'm on a cable car that's being pulled up this steeeep
incline.</p>

<p class=date>5:43pm</p>

<p>It just keeps getting better better better.</p>

<p>I was reminded of James Bond movies while in the suspended
gondola.  I had the car all to myself so I rocked it side to side,
causing the two huge cables to oscillate up and down.</p>

<p>The amazing silence pervaded my soul, soothing, invigorating.  Like
floating through outerspace except for the floating part.   A slight
hum sang to me, transmitted through the high tension cables holding my
private gondola.   There's almost nobody here.  I'm SO thankful that I
got lost on the mountain and got away from the crowd.  Now they've all
gone home and left this beautiful park for me to enjoy alone.</p>

<p>Huge.</p>

<p>Beautiful.</p>

<p>But I don't have enough time to continue the trek around Hakone, so
I'm on the way back.  It looked like it might get even *better*.
(More suspended gondolas, but with a view of Mt Fuji!) I'll find out
next time I'm here, no later than September.</p>

<p class=date>6:38pm</p>

<p>And now I'm back on the express train to Shinjuku.  (not the
limited express train on which I arrived (the one with reversable
seats and such) (didn't hurt to try riding it back as well) but
the normal line that any ol' bear can ride.</p>

<p>Cool thing is the train is nearly empty.</p>

<p>Two German women sitting in this same car; I think it's the first
time I've heard German while here.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Overall, I most loved what Lyndsey said when she heard I made
today's trip alone: "you're brave."</p>

<p>Awesome.</p>
