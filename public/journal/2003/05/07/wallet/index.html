<p>Oh my gosh.</p>

<p>I got a card in the mail and I assumed it was a "hey, jack, you got
a package; come pick it up at the post office."</p>

<p>I went to the post office and then I noted that there was postage
on the card; such a notice (come get your shiznit) wouldn't have
postage on it.</p>

<p>So before I got to the front of the line at the post office, I aborted 
my mission and went to see Koko.</p>

<p>I showed her the card, Ç±ÇÍÅÌÇ»ÇÒÇ≈Ç©? I asked her.</p>

<p>She looked and then gasped a bit.  "Ç≥Ç¢Å”!  they found your wallet.
It's at the police station in ÇµÇ»Ç™ÅÌ."</p>

<p>Wow wowowowowowoww.  I've been carrying this notice around in my
new wallet for some days now (since 2 May, I think), waiting for a
moment that I (A) had time, (B) had a working bicycle.</p>

<p>Whoooohoooooooo!!!!!!!!!!  AND fortunately, I have until 15 May
to pick it up before they ... archive it or something making it a more
challenging process to recover.</p>

<p>Past that I think she said I have 6 months to pick it up.</p>

<p>Oh, Japan, my faith in you is restored.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>nevermind</p>

<p class=date>1:48pm</p>

<p>I have been sitting outside the police station for five minutes,
meditatively reconciling my old stuff from my old wallet to my new
wallet with my old wallet chain.</p>

<p>I walked into the police station... wait.</p>

<p>Special thanks to those who helped me get to the police station.
Ç±Ç± for calling the cops to see where they are, then telling them I
don't have a "stamp" (Japanese version of a signature) so that I'd
only be able to sign for it, not stamp for it.</p>

<p>Thanks to the women about two blocks from the police station for
drawing me a map to it.</p>

<p>I walked into the police station and showed the woman my card.  She
took me to a window and showed the guy my card.  "Ç≥Ç¢Å”" <em>wallet</em>, she
said and I thanked her.  The guy looked at the card, went away, came
back with a bag containing some old beat up wallet with no ID in
it.</p>

<p>"Ç∑Å›Å‹ÇπÇÒ, that's not my wallet.  Ç»Ç¢.  Ç»Ç¢."</p>

<p>But I looked inside.  To my horror, I saw my driver license, my
gaijin card, my bank card.</p>

<p>No cash.</p>

<p>Oh Japan.  What happened to my wallet?</p>

<p>My bank card is broken.  The TDL and gaijin card were creased.  The
wallet looks worn.  Oh and no fucking train card in it either; I just
noticed that.  Sigh.</p>

<p>It must be the case that it got tumbled about in the street or something; that's the only way I can keep faith in Japanese culture - if the cash blew away with the wind then I'm okay with that.  As okay as I can be.</p>
