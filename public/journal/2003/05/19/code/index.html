                        <p class=date>11:27pm JST Monday 19 May 2003</p>

<p>At Fred's suggestion, I added a redirect from journal.pl to
journal.pl?date=yyyy/mm/dd.  So for example, today
www.robnugen.com/journal redirects twice, all the way to
www.robnugen.com/cgi-local/journal.pl?date=2003/05/19.</p>

<p>Lemme know if probs.</p>

<br>i sent you something.  some days ago.  apparently since its just now monday here..its tuesday there<br>
and it has been a while since i sent it.  and maybe it got lost.  but, i copied your adress down from online just right.   and made the man double check it was right.<br>
<br>
he said it was.  he said your mom must be happy living over there.  i said yeah, my mom is.<br>
<br>
then he asked how it was having your mom over seas?  i said.  i have two moms.  ones real ones not so rea, but we wont go there.<br>
<br>
haaaaaaaaaa<br>
<br>
not really,  but i thought about it.  i told him it was for my old youth leader.  and he inquired more about where i went to church and so forth and so on.  i like the people at my local  post office.<br>
<br>
some crazy kid is talking to me online that i dont know...ehh guess i will be very carefull<br>
<br>

<br>

<br>
ohhhhhhhhh we had ya at emerson lastnight(sunday) and it was a blast.  we talked about forgiveness...and people werent really talking bec. it was lots of new people. (uncomfortable i suppose)  but then we detoured and people were wayyyy comfrotable and opposing others opinions...i would say its our first *real* discussion.  it was awsome!<br>
<br>
