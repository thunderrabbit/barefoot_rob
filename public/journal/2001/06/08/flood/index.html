                        <p class=date>7:24 pm 8-6-01</p>

<p>Rain.  rain.  rain.  rain.   We left The Woodlands
at 6:00pm.  We have traveled 8.3 miles.  Eight point
three.  No end in sight of this line of cars.</p>

<p class=date>7:29 pm</p>

<p>8.4 miles.</p>

<p>"If you guys want to get out and stretch your
legs, feel free."</p>

<p>hahahahahaha!!</p>

<p class=date>7:36 pm</p>

<p>The youth are discussing some classic Long Jokes.. 
the <em>Fuck You Clown</em> joke, and <em>The Man In The Black Hat,
White Gloves, And Red Cape That Killed My Mom, My Dad,
My Seven Brothers And Seven Sisters</em></p>

<p class=date>7:37 pm</p>

<p>We have just made 8.5 miles.</p>

<p>I'm going to think of another good Long Joke to add
to my repertoire</p>

<p class=date>7:47 pm</p>

<p>I announced, "Okay, now we'e gone nine miles."</p>

<p>"Finally!" and "Yay!" came the collective cheer from back.</p>

<p>"Just kiddin'!  We're still at 8.5!!!!"</p>

<p>AHHAhahahahahaaha!!!!!</p>

<p>They didn't think it was quite as funny.  Really, I don't either.</p>

<p>I just turned the van off.</p>

<p class=date>7:54 pm</p>

<p>Van is still off.  I just called 713-CALL-MAP 
(Motorist Assistance Plan) and they said there are
reports of water flooded across the freeway, so
Montgomery County Sherrifs have closed the shit off. 
It's still raining heavily; we may not be going across
anytime soon.  Bluh.</p>

<p class=date>8:00 pm</p>

<p>I just called Annie, and we moved forward about 40
feet while I was talking  to her for a moment.  Still
at 8.5 miles on the odometer.</p>

<p>Van off again.</p>

<p class=date>8:04 pm</p>

<p>We just moved again and there is a truck driving
backwards on the shoulder with his hazards on. 
Oh, it's an unoffficial truck.</p>

<p class=date>8:06 pm</p>

<p>8.6 miles baby!!!!</p>

<p class=date>8:14 pm</p>

<p>Smom writes:</p>

<p>According to an eyewitness over the radio, water is rushing over the
freeway and and a guy is talking on his cell phone over the radio
now from the area.</p>

<p>he said there is 4 or 5 feet of wter  (over the 
road??)  up to windows in water on  some cars.</p>

<p class=date>8:16 pm</p>

<p>8.7 miles already.</p>

<p class=date>8:26 pm</p>

<p>8.8 miles.  Reports of road closures  all over
Houston.  I wonder how it will all pan out for us.</p>

<p class=date>8:29 pm</p>

<p>There is a parade of cars suddenly coming
southbound on I 45; I  don't  know where they are
coming from.  I wonder if the road is opened somehow
or what.  Maybe it's traffic U turned around..</p>

<p class=date>8:36 pm</p>

<p>One of te KTRH traffic reporters got stuck in  a
ditch.  Shelters are being opened around the  city.

<p class=date>8:39 pm</p>

<p>8.8 miles ....  I feel sad.  I am optimistic yet that we will be
able to reach OKC at least by tomorrow.  I predict the youth will want
to persevere, and get to the rally.  It will make a good story.</p>

<p class=date>8:53 pm</p>

<p>8.8 miles! and we are suddenly moving 100 yards. at 5 mph What is
happening???????</p>

<p>8.9 now wow we are flying at 2 mph.  two.</p>

<p class=date>8:57 pm</p>

<p>9.0 miles!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>how is it that we are moving????</p>

<p class=date>8:58 pm</p>

<p class=note>Susie again:</p>

<p>we  went 9 mph for a minute but not  much  more  than  that</p>

<p class=date>9:00 pm</p>

<p>Rock just got to the radio station (KTRH) and he is usually on in the morning so he said 'Good morniing' accidentally.  silly  man, old habits die hard.</p>

<p class=date>9:02 pm</p>

<p>moving again, but not much... 9.1  miles now</p>

<p class=date>9:03 pm</p>

<p>Christina singing Cabaret...Katy singing softly to 
something  playing  on  her personal CD  player</p>

<p>getting off I45 trying something different....getting on 75, going
through Conroe..Kids now singing 'Raindrops Keep Falliing...'  Ahh,
we're moviing, 35 mph</p>

<p class=date>9:22 pm</p>

<p>Rob again..  We  have bailed to highway 75  and are
at 12.4 miles.  stopped for gas.</p>

<p class=date>9:58 pm</p>

<p>Spirits are up; looks like we hae gotten past,
using 75.  I will call Annie only once we reach I-45
again</p>

<p class=date>10:25 pm</p>

<p>road is clear and damp. no rain. 65 mph. 45.7 miles traveled.</p>

<p class=date>12:54 am Saturday 9 June 2001</p>

<p>Susie has been driving and I've been sleeping. 
Had a scary jerk awake from a dream when I thought I
had fallen asleep while I was driving and I grabbed
for the steering wheel,  but it wasn't there and I
realized I was supposed to be sleepping.  quite a
relief that was.</p>

<p>We are at 224.0 miles traveled.</p>

<p>The music on the CD  player is a welcome relief
from the 'usual' stuff, which is 'usually'  stuff
that I've heard before a million times.  Truth  is,
though, that this muusic  is some that I  don't care
for in general, but it's nice to be uniqe at least.  I
would still rate it as good enough to play on KTRU. 
But  I'm  guessing it's  a bit  too  popular for us
to play.  I don't  know  though.</p>

<p class=date>2:07 am</p>

<p>We are well on our way after the most recent gas station stop,
where we have discovered that it appears we left our gas money
envelope at the previous gas station.  I just suddenly got the
brain-flash-thought that we donated the money to a charitable cause
.. maybe someone whose car flooded out and broke got the money.  Or
maybe Susie's husband Kevin will be able to recover it in the
morning.</p>

<p class=date>2:11 am</p>

<p>About 150 miles to OKC.</p>

<p>We are listening to Jets To Brazil on CD.</p>

<p class=date>2:16 am</p>

<p>Oh - only 126 miles to OKC; we are 2 miles inside
the OK border.</p>
