<p>I'm at HACYAC (Houston Area Cluster Youth Adult Committee (?))
meeting now; we are brainstorming and planning some social action
events to do.</p>

<p class=date>1:45 am</p>

<p>We just played two rounds of Mafia.  Mafia won both times; I was
mafia during the first game.  LSN and I just poured our apple juice

<p>Who is everything your mother warned you about?
<br>Phat Pat</p>

<p>This person's life is just like a soap opera.
<br>Heidi</p>

<p>If the secret to long and healthy life is an active sex life, who
would live to be 100?

playing Doctor?
<br>Matt</p>

<p>Who would be your sexy dream date?
<br>Gram</p>

<p>Who here has the most mysterious personality?
<br>John</p>

<p>If people were desserts, who would be angel food cake?
<br>Gram and Meg Cusack</p>

<p>Who do you think has saved every love letter ever received?
<br>Heidi</p>

<p>Who would be the first to take part in the sexual revolution of the
1960's?
<br>Matt</p>

<p>Who would you be for 24 hours?
<br>Rob!  (yay!  I finally won one!)</p>
