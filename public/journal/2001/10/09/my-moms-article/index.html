&nbsp;<BR></BR></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Arial">Tragedy has shocked us
into an examination
of the way this nation of peace and freedom does
business in the world.
Terrorism used to happen in distant places. Now,
explosions of death
and destruction have rocked us to the core.
</FONT>&nbsp;<BR></BR></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Arial">Grief mingles with
fury. No country deserved
such an act of terrorism. Where is God now? Where is
Allah? Where is
Yhwh? Why don&rsquo;t they do
something?</FONT>&nbsp;<BR></BR></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Arial">A Sufi was praying when
along came a
cripple, a beggar and a victim of assault. And seeing
them, he cried,
&ldquo;Great God, how is it that a loving creator can see
such things and
yet do nothing about them?&rdquo; And God said, &ldquo;I did do
something. I made
you.&rdquo;</FONT>&nbsp;<BR></BR></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Arial">OK, God, what are we to
do now? Retaliate?
Assassinate? Give up our freedom? We expect some
combination of responses.
These attacks demand increased vigilance as well as a
strong show of
force. I am appalled that misguided vigilantes have
assaulted mosques,
Muslims, and anyone who resembles them. Still, our
trigger fingers are
ready to fire even while the other hand guards the
safety. We want to
find some middle ground between &ldquo;an eye for an eye&rdquo;
and &ldquo;turn the other
cheek.&rdquo; We want the world safe again for our children.
What can we do?</FONT>&nbsp;<BR></BR>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Arial">We have already begun
to take a hard
look at ourselves. How is it that someone thought this
was a good idea?
People hijacked multiple planes and deliberately
sacrificed themselves
in exchange for maximum civilian casualties. Why is it
that they hated
us so much, or felt so unheard, or had so little to
lose, that they
were willing to take such desperate measures?
</FONT>&nbsp;<BR></BR>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Arial">We have been way &ldquo;too
busy&rdquo; to pay much
attention to the world&rsquo;s people. Millions starve while
we grab a bite
to eat or dine in quiet elegance. Refugees flee to
crowded camps while
we crowd into concert halls and sports arenas. Cheap
labor overseas
keeps our prices down and dividends high. And we&rsquo;re
surprised that people
hate us?</FONT>&nbsp;<BR></BR></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Arial">Officially, we have
isolated ourselves
in dramatic ways: by walking out of the Middle East
peace process,
challenging the nuclear test ban, refusing to sign the
Kyoto Accord,
dropping out of the racism summit, withholding dues
from the United
Nations even though we expect its support. Perhaps we
should not be
so quick to walk away from international issues. Only
when we stay in
the struggle can we find win-win solutions to
extremely complicated
problems. </FONT>&nbsp;<BR></BR></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Arial">We may even have to
compromise.</FONT>&nbsp;<BR></BR>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Arial">An image I try to keep
in my mind is
our beautiful planet Earth shown against the immensity
of space. No
divisions can be seen, no nations, no races, no
wealth, no poverty.
Last week the explosions must have been visible from
space when citizens
from many countries lost their lives. Now citizens
from many countries
must find a way to reach across our divisions until we
root out the
sources of terrorism. This is too small a world for
indiscriminate hatred.
We can no longer pretend this is someone else&rsquo;s
problem.</FONT>&nbsp;<BR></BR>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Arial">I believe that
God/Allah/ Yhwh calls
us to the light of possible human cooperation and
compassion. The rest
of the world stands ready to help us determine a wise
course of action
as we seek a better world for all
people.</FONT>&nbsp;<BR></BR></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Arial">God awaits our
decisions.</FONT>&nbsp;<BR></BR>
