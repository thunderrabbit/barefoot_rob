<p>New Orleans Rally Saturday Night</p>

<p>haitian woman workshop was wicked wonderful and now i want to learn
creole</p>

<p>sleep now</p>

<p class=date>12:14 am</p>

<p>sardines now</p>

<p>they were looking for kate and I almost found her, but didnt.  no
one found her.  now if we play again I have my hidiing place, but I
don't think we'll play again.</p>

<p>we did play (already) again Nick G hid and I found him, but we quit
to have worship.</p>

<p class=date>2:29 am</p>

<p>Talent show.  I started out with the joke about the kid who loved
to do dishes, and I recognized there are two distinct tones available
in the joke, the ending I mean.  I think it will stick in my repertoir
of Long Jokes.  It was only a 4 or 5 minute version to get the hang of
how it might go.</p>

<p>Aaron Ryan just played a KICK ASS piece on the piano dedicated to
Christina.</p>

<p>Other talent has included Ryan and Travis playing The Monkey Song
as Nick, Nick, and Ryan .. wait. I forget exactly who it was, but the
oh Mattboy was one of the Ryan's above.  I think the first one..
Maybe.  Anyway, it was funny.</p>

<p>I encouraged Nick to do a 3-headed wonder, which turned into the
two headed, one bunny headed wonder.  I was the moderator.</p>

<p>I don't remember all the other talents; I was practicing The
aphabet Game that Lauuryn, Kate and I made up on the way here.  We
performed it and pretty much remembered the whole thing.  I was pretty
sure I would mess up more than I did, but they went a lot slower than
when we had been practicing it.</p>

<p>Ryan M is singing The House of The Rising sun or New Orleans, or
whatever this song is called.</p>

<p>Lauren is singing the song she sang at OKC.</p>

<p>Silent Football now.</p>
