                        <p class=note>Wednesday 11 July 2001</p>

<p class=note>The Biblical Books below I just transcribed from the
sheet Nick used to read them near the beginning of the game.  I'm
writing this note now to assure you, <b>I was laughing SO HARD!</b> I
laughed my <em>ass</em> off.  I had tears streaming from the
incredible brilliance of writing.  I love love love love love love
these beautiful hilarious youth!!!!!  *This* is why I am a youth
advisor.</p>

<p class=date>2:43 am Sunday 8 July 2001</p>

<p>These great crazy wonderful youth have something funny crazy
planned for Silent Football, AND Ryan has a cassette player to record.
they have something crazy crazy planned.  Nick has a Bible and is
<em>Practicing</em> silently. Wow Wow.</p>

<p>Nick is reading from the Book of Shroop:</p>

<p class=message>The Book Of Shroop 1:1 - 1:10</p>

<p class=message>In the beginning the Universe was without form, and
void; and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.  And in
the beginning was the football; and the football was with God; and the
football was God.</p>

<p class=message>And on the First Day, God said, Let there be Fwap:
and there was Fwap; and God divided the Fwap from the Fwizap. And on
the Second Day God created the Zoom and the Froom. And on the Third
Day God created The Shrug and The Frug.  And on the Fourth Day God
created The Shrotum and the Frotum.  And on the Fifth Day God created
The Tattle, and The Penance Point.  And on the Sixth Day God created
Mister Dictator in His own image; in the image of God created He
him.</p>

<p class=message>And God said unto him, Be dictatorial, and dictate,
and give dictation to the Universe, and subdue it; and have dominion
over the members thereof, and over nonexistent creatures, and over
every living thing that moveth upon the earth.</p>

<p class=message>The Book Of Heshesians 2:8</p>

<p class=message>Then Mr Dictator begat Duke Penispotato, and
Heyoushebab, and Heshekiel; and Duke Penispotato begat Lord Cockpotato
and Itshethemball; and Lord Cockpotato begat Hethemiah, and Sheusweel,
and Tubesteaktuber-sensei; and Tubesteaktuber-sensei begat Haggis, and
Master Spudschlong, and Youcifer and the Reverand Itthemshe, who
preacheth the word of The Lord to the heathen; and Master Spudschlong
begat Sir Phallusfries, and Heyoushelah; and Sir Phallusfries begat
Mister Dongkerstoffel, who smote the heinous with the sword, and with
the cudgel, and with penance points, and with the rubber truncheon,
and with the water balloon, because they had defiled the land with
their ceaseless fwapping.</p>

<p>this is your note taker, kate robinson. i am playing silent
football for the first time in about 3 years. crazy-ocity.</p>

<p>reverand itthemshe ((nick carter)) turned on his laptop computer and a
choir of angels was heard throughout the universe.</p>

<p>we changed the move for a frug. instead of moving your knees...you
have to raise your pelvis. basically hump the air. the logic, which
came from the brain of mr. nicholas carter, is that a shrug is done
with the shoulders nick sucks and the hips are the leg eqivalent of
shoulders. makes sense ryan sucks to me.</p>

<p>it took a really fucking long time to say all of the rules. and it
took longer to say all of the moving rules than the speaking rules.</p>

<p>the best names: matt boy: rabbi respect, kate: miss ryan mccarthy
sucks, lauuryn: miss bunny bunny bunny bunny whoops bunny whoops bunny
bunny bunny bunny, joan: 'someone pick a name for me' miss joan of
arc...next, laura: miss i'm so fucking confused, nick gruenwald:
heshekiel, ryan: heelshebub, aaron: the return of mr. d.</p>

<p>ryan doesn't like  my name.</p>

<p>we're finally starting...it's 3:33...something like an hour or more of
rules etc.</p>

<p>ryan talked less than a second after free speech had been revoked.</p>

<p>mr. dictator called on him to speak briefly. that didn't
happen...and he called mr. dictator infidel cock spud.</p>

<p>ryan talks too much...cloven hoof one b my ass ((no wonder karen
((miss llama)) doesn't play silent football anymore.</p>

<p>isn't who a pronoun?</p>

<p>reverand itthemshe always spoke from the silent football
bible...specifically the book of shroturonomy.</p>

<p>i'm retarded.  3/4 pennance points for not paying attention.</p>

<p>i think i'm the only one who noticed mr. dictator almost call
mistress scratch and sniff mistress scratch and shit.</p>

<p>ryan is going to cry. because he will lose. probably soon.  rob is
also racking up the points.</p>

<p>we just found out that the d in mr. d stands for dreidel, and not
devil worshipper as accused by rev. itthemshe.</p>

<p>but then rabbi respect said that the d stood for disrespect and
then said that mr. d was going to hell.</p>

<p>he seems to be going against his name.</p>

<p>matt fucked up BAD he said that mr. d was going to hell...jews
don't believe in hell. rob changed his name from rabbi respect to
rabbit respect.</p>

<p>Miss bunny bunny bunny bunny whoops bunny whoops bunny bunny bunny
bunny invited rabbit respect and mr. d to her burrow for 'rapid
reproduction'. rabbit respect accepted, and heshekiel then spoke out
of turn saying 'tap that bunny ass'</p>

<p>the universe was in shambles of laughter.</p>

<p>aaron has said 'it' more times than anyone ever has. his name has
now changed to mr. duderiffical ((the true eponym of mr. d)).</p>

<p>heelshebub called mr. d a poop head...heelshebub got told.</p>

<p>ryan said 'in short.'</p>

<p>hahahahahahahahaha</p>

<p>lauuryn hopped all the way back to the universe from the bathroom.</p>

<p>ryan's about to lose. sooooooooooo close.</p>

<p>"while we are the real religion, the christians are funnier."
--Miss bunny bunny bunny bunny whoops bunny whoops bunny bunny bunny
bunny</p>

<p>the religious debte within our universe has reached 'ungodly'
heights. the christians are out of control. whereas the rabbits are
getting more celery.</p>

<p>the celery is overflowing in the universe. reverand itthemshe is
contemplating converting.</p>

<p>miss bunny bunny bunny bunny whoops bunny whoops bunny bunny bunny
bunny threw celery at him.</p>

<p>in the most pathetic defence ever tried, ryan mccarthy ((who
happens to suck)) professes that "pennance points make me stronger."
--heelsheub</p>

<p>"none for you, christian!" --miss bunny bunny bunny bunny whoops
bunny whoops bunny bunny bunny bunny to heshekeil when he took some
celery</p>

<p>rev. itthemshe fwapped the bible, and heshekiel said 'holy fwap!'</p>

<p>nick g. aka heshekiel claims his repeated release of gas into the
universe</p>

<p>heshekiel farted at mr. dictator. it was funny. the universe laughed.</p>

<p>i'm trying to pay attention to the game and type at the same
time. it is very hard. i think i'm missing a lot.</p>

<p>the rabbits are bunny hopping around the universe. rabbit respect
obviously is a new rabbit...because he looked fairly confused.  he
forgets the toe-pointing part of the dance.  however, rabbit respect
now lives with the other rabbits on mr. dictator's left hand side,
where he ranks as official keeper of the celery.</p>

<p>rabbit respect now hides in the (celery) brush, camoflaged from
Xtian persecution.  while i, Miss bunny bunny bunny bunny whoops bunny
whoops bunny bunny bunny bunny, imitate Heelshebub with celery as his
'cloven hooves'</p>

<p>Heshekiel is crossing over to the dark side.  The great carrot god
smiles upon the universe.</p>

<p>Mr. Dictator, Miss bunny bunny bunny bunny whoops bunny whoops
bunny bunny bunny bunny and Rabbit Respect remain the only member of
the universe actually sitting up.</p>

<p>heelshebub forgot his own name. so did heshekiel.</p>

<p>the end of the game...nick g. only spoke one time without touching
himself.</p>

<p>the game has concluded. no loser was declared...but heelshebub had
4 1/8 pennance points.</p>
