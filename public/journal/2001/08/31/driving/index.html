<p>We're in Corsicana now at Wende's, chillin' and eating and writing journal entries, respectively.</p>

<p>How often do I hit the z key?</p>

<p>So we have yet to pick up Paul; he's about 2 miles up the road at the Texaco, but it was determined that he should wait there for a bit while we eat.</p>

<p>When we left Houston, it was raining a bit, but nothing like during our trip to OKC. </p>

<p>Laura (Erica's mom) and I have been talkin' computer stuff most of the way up here.  Three vehicles total.  The youth (Amy) organized them all.  Great job, guys!  And thanks to your respective parental units for the vehicles.</p>

<p>Erica is full after she ate fries.  Very weird, she says.</p>

<p>Before the rally, Katharine gave me a ride from work to get my car at the shop.  We had a great conversation about religion and God and the nature of sin and afterlife and all that.  Wonderful conversation for about 45 minutes.  Finally I had to leave for the woodlands.  We'll pick up the conversation on Tuesday or so.</p>

<p class=date>11:59 pm Friday 31 August 2001</p>

<p>294 miles traveled</p>

<p>TinaP's head hurts badly after eating ice cream really fast and chasing Ryan.</p>

<p>So we just went to McDonald's and I was dismayed that we didn't all go to the <em>Braum's</em> next door.  So after Ryan briefed me on his Pink Elephant Joke, starring George Foreman, we (Ryan and I, not George Foreman) went over to Braum's.</p>

<p>I complimented him on a great Elephant Joke as we walked spiritfully to Braum's.  Ryan reached forward to politely open the door for me, but it was stuck.  They were closed.</p>

<p>"Nooooooo!!!!"  I collapsed onto my back. "Fifty yards we walked <em>all the way</em> to Braum's and they're closed!!!!"</p>

<p>"Oh, the agony!" chimed Ryan.</p>

<p>We looked plaintively in to the employees, who were no longer looking at us.  "Aw, they don't care; let's go."</p>

<p>Ryan was all, "okay, it's all about presentation.  We should go into McDonald's holding our stomachs, 'Oh my god that Braum's ice cream is SO GOOD!!  Oh you guys missed it; they are closed now.   You should consider staying overnight until they open because it's just that good.'"</p>

<p>I suggested that we could walk through the McDonald's drive through and get ice cream in unmarked cups.</p>

<p>Instead, we went inside and each got a McFlurry.  But... and here is where the story takes a turn for the worse, or the better, depending on one's point of view. (Most people would say it took a turn for the bizarre).  The guy squirted the ice cream into my cup and then gave it two taps, "spanks if you will," proposed Ryan, to settle the ice cream.   Ryan got three spanks.  <em>three</em>! </p>

<p>But, that's nothing.  Marky Mark got <em>four</em> spanks, more ice cream, and one more spank!!  For a total of FIVE spanks!!  FIVE!!</p>

<p>308 miles traveled now.</p>
