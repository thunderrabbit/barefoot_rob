<p>STATE OF THE ART</p>

<p>Year of Living Geekily: Even the Dogs Evolved</p>

<p>By DAVID POGUE</p>

<p>OR observers of human nature, the end of
the year presents a golden opportunity for
spotting geeks in their native habitats.
Normal people pull tags off gifts; geeks put
batteries into them. Normal people spend the week
watching movies and reading newly unwrapped books;
geeks hook things up to the television.
Normal people make up New Year's resolutions like
"Clean the garage," "Learn French" or "Get
more exercise." Geeks pledge to "Clean up the
Web site," "Learn JavaScript" and "Get more
RAM."</p>

<p>While waiting for the computer to reboot,
we geeks may also pause to reflect on the industry
itself. For stockholders, this was the year that the
high-tech bubble burst with a definitive pop. And it
will be some time before venture capitalists back any
20-year- old with a clever PowerPoint pitch.</p>

<p>Even so, some fundamental truths still apply.
Prices continue to fall, as this season's owners of
$100 DVD players are happy to point out. Computer
power continues to climb (2-gigahertz processors),
even if many consumers already have more megahertz
than
they know what to do with. And manufacturers continue
to revise and improve their products with
disconcerting speed.</p>

<p>As evidence that the innovation engine is
still chugging along, you have but to consider this
column's topics over the last 12 months. Here is a
look at what has become of some of the year's most
notable products, updates that you can clip and paste
into your carefully archived originals.</p>

<p>NET APPLIANCES</p>

<p>Almost all the Internet appliances I
reviewed a year ago 
have
gone to that
           great Circuit City in the sky.</p>

<p>You didn't need a Ouija board to foretell
the death of 
3Com's
Audrey
           ($500). Its tiny screen could show only
part of a Web page; 
its
punctuation
           keys were mere slivers; and it offered only
a single e-mail
account for each
           machine. As for its rival, the Gateway
Connected Touch Pad
($600), you
           could have measured its Web-page download
speed in ice ages.</p>

<p>Only Compaq's IA-1 seemed to be poised for
success: it was
relatively fast,
           inexpensive and well designed. (A few
IA-1's are still 
available
at
           Walmart.com for $200.)</p>

<p>But just $600 could buy a full PC, with a
CD-ROM drive, a 
bigger
monitor
           and so on. The limited, awkward Internet
appliances simply
couldn't
           compete.</p>

<p>Only one device survives: Honeywell's
WebPad (now $1,970). 
It's a
           flat-panel touch screen that maintains a
fast, cordless link 
to
your cable or
           D.S.L. modem as you walk around the house
or office. Both 
the
price and
           the requirement for a high-speed connection
should tip you 
off
that this
           machine isn't aimed at non-techies.

           Funny, isn't it? The big companies had it
wrong. It wasn't 
the
everyday
           consumers who wanted Internet appliances.
It was the geeks.</p>

<p>DIGITAL PETS</p>

<p>Aibo the robot dog by Sony (news/quote)
was, and is, a 
remarkable
           machine. Useless, but remarkable. It can
walk on its own --
seeing
with
           cameras, hearing with microphones, thinking
with software. 
It can
even learn
           new tricks.</p>

<p>But not everyone considered Aibo a steal at
$1,500. Within
nanoseconds,
           toy companies leaped into the fray with
their own models: 
copycat
dogs that
           did less but also cost less. Eventually
Sony's engineers, no
doubt sighing with
           resignation, set about the task of
designing an Aibo 
knockoff of
their own.
</p>

<p>The result was the new Aibo LM series
($850): cuter, 
rounder,
smaller dogs
           that still respond to vocal commands and
can "learn" new
behaviors. The
           cheaper dogs cannot send audio and video to
your PC 
wirelessly,
as the
           more expensive Aibo can when equipped with
a $150 software 
kit.
But for
           anyone who longs for companionship yet
doesn't have the 
energy to
care for
           an analog dog, the price for the ultimate
laptop has dropped
considerably.</p>

<p>MAC'S NEW CORE</p>

<p>With all the hoopla about Windows XP, it is
easy to forget 
that
there is
           another good-looking, super-stable
operating system gaining
popularity:
           Apple's Mac OS X.</p>

<p>The overhaul of OS X, version 10.1,
released in September, 
was so
           sweeping that it made the original look
like a dress 
rehearsal.
The current
           version is much faster, includes a long
list of useful 
features,
and restores the
           DVD playback and CD burning that were
missing from the 
original.
</p>

<p>Even better news is that by now, most
big-name programs have 
been
revised
           to take advantage of Mac OS X's beauty and
stability, 
including
Microsoft
           (news/quote) Office, America Online,
FileMaker, Illustrator,
Freehand and
           Final Cut Pro. Mac fans should take note
that it's finally 
safe
to make the
           switch, as long as they're prepared to pay
the upgrade fees 
for
the programs
           they use.</p>

<p>THE MASTER'S VOICE</p>

<p>For all the attention given to computers
that understand 
human
speech in
           sci-fi movies, it's strange how little
fanfare surrounds 
this
category now that
           it's here.</p>

<p>In any case, both leading Windows
speech-recognition 
programs are
           available in new versions. The chief virtue
of I.B.M.'s 
ViaVoice
Release 9, a minor upgrade, is its inclusion (in
           the deluxe version) of a U.S.B. headset
microphone that 
improves
accuracy. Naturally Speaking 6,
           meanwhile, is an ambitious merger of
features from the 
onetime
rival programs L&H VoiceXPress and
           Dragon Naturally Speaking.</p>

<p>The most impressive feature of NatSpeak 6,
however, is its 
very
existence: it was born during the public
           disintegration of its maker, Lernout &
Hauspie. Only two 
weeks
ago the company sold its speech software to
           Scansoft, so that NaturallySpeaking and its
descendants may 
live
on.</p>

<p>(There is also news for Mac fans: The last
few months have 
seen
the release of both ViaVoice for Mac OS X
           and iListen for Mac OS 9.2.1.)</p>

<p>DICK TRACY'S LENS</p>

<p>Casio's weird and wonderful Wrist Camera
($230) still shows 
only
shades of gray on the watch face when
           you take pictures. But the recently
upgraded watch (model
WQV3-1BNDL) actually stores color
           photographs (80 at a time), which you can
see when you later 
beam
them, via infrared, to your PC.</p>

<p>These pictures aren't what you'd call
gargantuan -- in fact,
they're 176 by 144 pixels, just over two inches
           square. But when you need to be
surreptitious or 
spontaneous,
there's no smaller digital camera outside the
           C.I.A.</p>

<p>TUNES TO GO</p>

<p>Apple's iPod is a spectacular music player.
It holds 130 
CD's
worth of music in a
           white-acrylic-and-mirror-finish player not
much bigger than 
a box
of Tic Tacs. No MP3 player offers this
           capacity in anywhere near such a small
size, especially not 
with
12 hours of battery life.</p>

<p>But Apple said that the iPod could
synchronize its music 
library
only with Macs. Fortunately for PC fans,
           xPlay, a $40 Windows program being readied
for a January 
release,
will let you load your iPod with music
           and use it as an external hard drive for
your PC, just as on 
a
Mac. An early version is available at
           www.mediafour.com.</p>

<p>PIXELS' PROGRESS</p>

<p>The PC industry is no longer the youngster
it once was, 
exploding
with monthly leaps in sales growth and
           features. Nowadays, it's the digital camera
industry that 
behaves
that way.</p>

<p>The cameras I reviewed in 2001 are already
smaller, cheaper 
and
better. As noted last week, 2.2-megapixel
           models now sell for under $300.
Four-megapixel cameras cost 
less
than half what they did a year ago. And
           Sony's CD1000, which burns its images
directly onto 
mini-CD's,
ready for archiving or inserting into your
           computer, no longer requires $1,500 and a
wheelbarrow. 
Today,
Sony's CD200 offers about half the bulk
           and price ($800).</p>

<p>The lesson from the camera business is the
same one that 
we've
learned over and over again from the PC
           business, the VCR business and the DVD
business: The longer 
you
wait, the better the deal you'll get.</p>

<p>Of course, you know what we geeks would
say: Where's the fun 
in
that?</p>
