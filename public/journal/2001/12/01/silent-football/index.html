<br>sexy shorts explains the past behind mr.
dictator's name 'Kleinen freund in deinen hose
kartoffeln' to big funk entirely in German. Mr.
dictator talks about the mime's funny shoe thing for
no apparent reason. 
<br>10:08 pm there was confusion as to whether mr.
yellow shirt existed or not. apparently he does.
<br>mr. ratzoe's butt seems to have immediately
forgotten that mr. yellow shirt does exist.
<br>simon came in and sat in between padre and scratch
n sniff. in order to fwap right, scratch has to fwap
simon's right leg, to fwap left, padre has to fwap
simon's left leg. 
<br>miss erin doesn't know what to do when she gets
the ball so she shrugged. everyone cheered and the
game continued. she looked confused.
<br>mr phat pat's name is changed to mistah dobolina
mistah bob dobolina 
<br>mister dictator tells a funny calvin story after
asking what the fuck mistress ratt was doing (shaking
up the cokes) 'what does it look like  im doing?'
<br>customary fuck you clown fuck you!
<br>Ms bryn mysteriously dissapeared.
<br>Mr yellow shirt recieves 1/2 penance point for
wasting mr. dictator's time.

<br>--Fat Pat while burping 'shut up'  he he he he he
he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he
he he he --mr yellow shirt who just burped after the
decree of no more burping.
<br>namechange zoomed a cold rush of air. mr yellow
shirt got 1/2 a pen pt for burping again.</p>

<p class=message>Mr Yellow Shirt intentionally has
gulped so much air so he can burp that he is all 'ow'
and can hardly get a burp out!
<br>hahahahaha
<br>duke one eyed trouser snake curley fries</p>

<p>mr yellow shirt discovers that he has 9 penance
points, and loses the game.</p>

<p>He had to perform Little Bunny Foo Foo while being
held upside down at the talent show.</p>
