                        <p><title>Dream notes</title>
<p class=date>2:29am CST Tuesday 13 March 2001</p></p>

<p>It's now 2:54am.  I just spent 25 minutes writing the following
notes from my dream.  I probably won't convert them into a pretty
format; there's enough long paragraphs to satisfy me.</p>

<p>The first part I'm just capturing snippets, then I wrote some
more.</p>

<p>The notebook referenced twice below was a pocket folder with 3
brads in it, not rings.</p>

<p>I thought the owl bite part of the dream was real, and I went
inside to get the paper to write down my experience.</p>

<p>"wene" is supposed to be "Wende"</p>

<p>"riber" is supposed to be "river"</p>

<p>"$4.46" and then I spelled the correct amount out because I knew it
was likely I hit the wrong keys.</p>

<p>The "0 0 0" is me trying to separate with "- - - -"</p>

<p>(Okay, now it is 3:02am; here is what I actually wrote after waking
up from my dream:)</p>

<pre>
owl bite finger upside down tree

inside and the back outside to play some more

bite was real

back inside to write down my journal  and then looking for a notebook
looking at the mess in my apartment

Spot didn't come back inside when I offered.

I was naked by the counter, putting pater in my 3 ring not  3 brad
notebook

patrick came home and was all announcemtn link "guess who just found
Sp

guess who I u just found?  Mr Spot!"  and e let spot inside and I was
all come on in but I 'm naked.  I was actually leaning so he could
only see my booty booty and he  complimented meon how clean my place
looked compared to his, but Michelles was a mess so that is all he
cared about.  "I Love that you guys are competing on that.  I love
it."

They used to be apartent mates in the apremtne next to me.




I woke p when wene was wiggling in bed.  

- - - - - - 

speeding down a riber, trying not oto hit all the turtles that were
sunning themselves on rockes.  big turtles too, big eough to  dent the
bottom of the boat.  4 fee  2 foot across turtles.  as  some
leatherback sea turtles, some galapagos big totoises.  I was trying to
catch up with someone to have them marvel at the wildlife, but I
realized I had to just let them go do what thye wanted so ** slowed
down.  I marveled even more tat the big turtles as I slowed down, and
the little bitty fish and a huge big angel fish! oh my gosh it was
like 1 foot tall  and it nibbled at the side of my lef and OW!  That
pactically hurt!  I moved my legs out of the water and he still poked
his head out of the water to nible.  

I saw an otter, and another otter.  I was scared they might bite me,
but they ddi not.  Very thankful to have slowed down to take the time
to look at the wildw lofe.

Hanging upside down in a tree, I climbed wile upside down in this treI
was specificaly upisde down (almost slept at the I) and looking
carefuly at the bark and branches to see how to pull myslef up.  I was
awaret hat my legs were above me and I needed to manuever them around
a tree banch in order to clmb higher.  I got them around (under0
branch and was actaually lower thatn I meant to be after that
manuever.  It took some strength to hold myself upside down like
this.  

I saw a little baby owl in the tree, adn it tried to bite me and like
clamped down on my  around my knuckle as if to  bit the entire
knuckele off, but it just left a diamond shape cut around my whollle
knuckles.  he didn't rip any flesh off my finger.  whew.

I got down out of the tree to go upstairs in my apartment and write
down my experience in my journal.    Then some friends came over so
was just upstairs to grab some paper in a notepad folder and was
putting the papter in the foler when Patrick brought Spot in for me.  

- - - -

Dude and I worked near the same bplace, for different departments in
the same company.  He worked for Robert W, my old boss.  Dude was
showing me some stuff he had learned, and I needed to get back to work
so I watched him only for a bit longer.  Then I walked back to my desk
and there were actually two computers, each were shaped like a video
game car racing game where the player ets in to "drive"  .  A girl
wanted to log in a check her email so she asked me about it and i said
it was possible, and according to the computer cost  $4.46  (four
thirty-five) tjust to log in.  I thought that amount was a bit high,
so I logged in and lter her use my accounte.  account.  It took me a
whle to figure out how to log in; I was at the C:\ prompt and and
finally was able to log in.  There was another guy who wanted to use
the other computer, but I didn't want to let him use it; I wanted to
use at least <em>one</em> of the computers.

I left the area to go home and  something .. I talked to someon in the
parking lot and then I was on the river speeding across it, ignoring
the wild life at first.  Then the whole sunfsh thing happened. 

Then the thig with the owl and I was going to write it down

flying.  city blocks outside trees compliment walking along 0 0 0

<p class=note>(here is the refined version of the dream)</p>

<p class=dream>Dude and I worked near the same place, for different

Dude was showing me some stuff he had learned, and I needed to get

shaped like a video game car racing game where the player gets in to
"drive" .  A girl wanted to log in and check her email so she asked me
about it and I said it was possible, and according to the computer
cost $4.35 just to log in.  I thought that amount was a bit high, so I
logged in and let her use my account.  It took me a whle to figure out
how to log in; I was at the C:\ prompt and and finally was able to log

had to just let them go do what they wanted so *I* slowed down.  I
marveled even more at the big turtles as I slowed down, and the little
bitty fish and a huge big angel fish! oh my gosh it was like 1 foot

<p class=dream>Hanging upside down in a tree, I climbed while hanging

that.  I love it."</p>

<p>They used to be apartment mates in the apartment next to me.</p>

<p>I woke up when Wende was wiggling around in bed.</p>
