<p><p>Well, they took Wende&rsquo;s jewelry, clock radio, phone and a hand towel and
wash cloths (probably to wipe fingerprints).  Jewelry included
grandmother&rsquo;s diamond earrings, an expensive diamond and platinum ring, and
sacred Aggie Ring (which I think can be replaced free of charge).</p>

<p><p>Her most prized possessions, her cats were fine; in fact, Thief
remounted the window panes which kept the cats in.  Went out through the
front door, leaving it unlocked.</p>

<p><p>But, sense of safety has been shattered. Wende has been considering
moving somewhere else anyway (lease is up soon); maybe this will do it.
 We&rsquo;ve been considering getting a year lease in 2 bedroom place (with alarm
system).  Dunno if that will happen or not.</p>

<p><p>(I&rsquo;m actually guessing not, unless Wende begins the footwork to look; I
have almost no interest in moving until April of next year.  (That&rsquo;s when I
complete my term on district YAC and my last ties to Texas will be
released.  (&lsquo;cept for my dad and mom, but there&rsquo;s always the phone.) I&rsquo;ve
been weaning back my youth group involvement for a while now.) At that
point, I&rsquo;m looking west to Santa Monica!)</p>

<p><p><hr></p>

<p><p>Today at work I&rsquo;ve been researching smoke alarms.  Maybe I&rsquo;ll look into
a security alarm too!  I&rsquo;m gonna consult with local Fire Marshall Plan
Checking to see where we should install smoke alarms.  I&rsquo;ve got floor plans
for our suite, and I learned that we&rsquo;ve expanded our suite once.
 Interesting to learn the history and see the evidence in the ceiling,
wall, floor (who is it?) surfaces!</p>

<p><p>Um, that&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p><p>With Love
<br>- Rob</p>

<p><p>Oh wait..  I&rsquo;ve been working on transcribing my past life regression
adventures. Here&rsquo;s the short version:</p>

<p><p>In a physically relaxed state, I was verbally led through visualization
in a limo, out into the country, through a fog, out of limo, to my Guide,
across a bridge to &hellip;.  and I filled in the blanks from there.</p>

<p><p>First &ldquo;place&rdquo; seemed not to be a past life, but just a very relaxed
place.</p>

<p><p>Second I found myself walking down a steep mountain road, carrying some
coins to purchase spices at a trading area at the base of the mountain.  I
had been sent by my wife.  In that life I was a pretty dumb guy who just
did what he was told by his wife.</p>

<p><p>Third place, I found myself as a pirate on a ship in the middle of the
ocean, on a ship we had stolen from another group.  I was physically huge
HUGE like Arnold Schwarzenegger huge and had saved my captain&rsquo;s life.  We
were on an adventure to Spain(?) to get a big phat load of gold and jewels.
 The ship was disbanded after our payoff and I lived on the wealth in a
&ldquo;hotel&rdquo; for the rest of my life.</p>

<p><p>Last, I found myself leading a group of friends (tribe) through dense
jungle on a Peace Offering mission with the neighboring tribe.  We had to
not be caught or would be attacked by their tribe, but once we arrived and
offered peace, the war would be over.  Turns out <em>I</em> was the peace
offering.  I lived the rest of my life in this new village, and peace
reigned between our tribes.</p>

<p><p>&mdash;&ndash;</p>

<p><p>So far, I&rsquo;ve transcribed 3.5 of the adventures, and am almost done.  I
still have to HTML format them, but that shouldn&rsquo;t take too long.</p>

<p><p>With Love
<br>- Rob</p>
