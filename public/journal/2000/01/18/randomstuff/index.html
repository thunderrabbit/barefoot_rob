                        <p><title>Random Stuff</title>
<p class=date>10:28pm CST Tuesday 18 January 2000</p></p>

<p><p>I did random stuff today at work: picked up Deborah&rsquo;s workstation from CPE (they added a modem to it), installed Hot Spot which will turn my screensaver on instantly, inventoried a few more machines, and removed a few old usernames from our system.</p>

<p><p>I also did a lot of chatting on AIM: Bryn, Matt, Bryan, Micaela, Dude, and Rocky.  Biggest chat sessions were with Bryn and Micaela. I might(!) include part of Micaela&rsquo;s because it included some of my thoughts on past lives and past life regression.</p>

<p><p>You know why?  Because tomorrow after KTRU, I will experience a past life regression session with Lily Roddy, an astrologer and stuff in the Houston area.  She was suggested to me by my dad when I asked if he would regress me. (My dad recently obtained a degree in hypnotherapy.)</p>

<p><p>Lily will record the session and I intend to transcribe a great deal of it to my website.  (Assuming a great deal of it is interesting!)</p>

<p><p>Tonight I talked to Marcel.  The moment I mentioned past life stuff, we began our great biblical debate.  Not all dramatic angry debate, but just &ldquo;why isn&rsquo;t it as clear to you as it is to me?&rdquo; debate.</p>

<p><p>At the very end, Marcel asked me two questions:</p>

<p><p>1) Why do I believe in reincarnation?</p>

<p><p>2) Why don&rsquo;t I believe in reincarnation?</p>

<p><p>Hmmm.</p>

<p><p>1) I believe in reincarnation because of evidence I&rsquo;ve seen/heard/read about it.  There are those who say, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t believe all that you see/hear/read&rdquo; but to that I say, &ldquo;do you believe men have walked on the moon?   Were you there?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I have <em>experienced</em> astral projection.  As real an experience as I now experience myself sitting in this chair typing, I experienced astral projection.  Not like in a dream with weird and wild shapes.  I was in my bed, I woke up without opening my eyes, and I felt myself folded at the hips with my feet hovering over my face.  Just like that.</p>

<p><p>My experience of astral projection (actually I think the correct term in this case is etheric projection) ensures I <em>know</em> I do not need my body in order to survive.  I can survive outside my body.  Therefore I <em>know</em> I have a something (I call it soul) that can live without my body.  I jump to the conclusion that my physical body can die and my soul will live.</p>

<p><p>I have read a book written by a man who disbelieved in past lives until he inadvertantly regressed a woman to her past lives.  <em>Many Lives, Many Masters</em> by Brian L. Weiss.</p>

<p><p>I have experienced synchronicities in my life that simply cannot be attributed to chance.  Just today <em>today!!</em> as I was leaving work, I was thinking about how Lily Roddy is Phil Roddy&rsquo;s new identity (s/he&rsquo;s having a gender change), and how tomorrow I&rsquo;m going to see her for this past life thing.  I started my car and turned on KTRU.  The song lyric was clearly exactly something about a man who changed his physical gender to a woman.  I had never previously heard the song.</p>

<p><p>I have heard many stories about people being regressed to past lives and instantly accessing information they could not have possibly known in their current incarnation: names of dead people, foreign languages, locations of objects..</p>

<p><p>What else?  What else?  I don&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;m tired and losing my thought train.</p>

<p><p>2) Why don&rsquo;t I believe in reincarnation?</p>

<p><p>Because most people have no clear memory of past lives.  Because society says it&rsquo;s not true.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ll write more tomorrow.</p>

<p><p>With Love
<br>- Rob</p>
