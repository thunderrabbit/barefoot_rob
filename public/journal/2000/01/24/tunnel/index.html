<p class=date>4:20pm CST Monday 23 January 2000</p></p>

<p><p>I had to do it.</p>

<p><p>Highway 59 is under construction (it&rsquo;s being widened)
near my house.  A section
of 59 travels through a very short canyon type thing below
ground level, allowing some residential streets to cross
it with no interruption.</p>

<p><p>One of these bridges (the one called Hazard Street Bridge)
includes a big pipe/tube thing 24 inches in diameter that
carries who knows what across the bridge.</p>

<p><p>Because the bridge highway is being widened, a new
longer pipe sits beside the old pipe, ready to go into
place to carry who knows what across the longer bridge.</p>

<p><p>Construction has always intrigued me; I love watching
the big machines scoop loads of dirt, or shattered sections
of concrete, or pour new concrete, or lift giant sections
of highway or whatever.</p>

<p><p>Today as I drove by, I noticed that there was no such
activity going on at this bridge.  I decided to take a
long around.</p>

<p><p>Saw some dirt, a hole or two, big giant posts to hold
the new pipe, and I saw the new pipe.  Nice bright turquoise,
24 inches in diameter, and pretty dang long.  I peered
inside and could see the light from the other end.  It
wasn&rsquo;t a perfect circle of light; the ends were slightly
bent downward:</p>

<p><p><pre></p>

<hr />

<p>/                                </p>

<p></pre></p>

<p><p>But there was light and the tube looked clear of
obstructions.  Hmm.</p>

<p><p>I walked along it a bit, banged on it some, gave
it a good push..  seemed quite solid and didn&rsquo;t move at
all.  Hmm.</p>

<p><p>I walked the entire length, watching traffic pass by
underneath the bridge, watching for anyone watching me,
watching my brain in general.  Hmm.</p>

<p><p>I got to the other end and peered in again.  It looked
clear from this end as well, although this end was resting
on some plywood (instead of spilling into the air on the
first end), making the exact entrance a bit less than
24&rdquo; in diameter.   Hmm.</p>

<p><p>I looked around a bit more and checked the time on my
cell phone.  1:55pm.  My brain was in overdrive.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Awright.  Probably nothing bad will happen.  There&rsquo;s
no dogs or monsters in the pipe.  Plenty of air in it.<br />
No one is watching.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Are you crazy?  What if I get stuck?  How would anyone
find me?  What if the workers come back right now and
install the pipe with me in it?  They would never hear me
screaming!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Man, it&rsquo;s Sunday!  No one is going to install this
pipe right now, c&rsquo;mon.  Plus, what if you <em>don&rsquo;t</em>
do it?  You will never know.  Never never never.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So? I will still be alive.  I can imagine what it would
be like - tight squeeze; not really a big deal.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;So do it!  You&rsquo;re only 30, man.  This opportunity might
not come again soon.  You gotta do it while you&rsquo;re young!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Awright.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>So I wriggled my way inside.</p>

<p><p>Hmm.  Not as much airflow as I might have guessed.
<br>Hmm.  Not as much room as I might have guessed.
<br>Ow, this little gravel shit is sharp on my knees.</p>

<p><p>I began in prone position, pulling myself forward on
my elbows and toes.  That took a significant amount of
energy and I quickly began to feel hot and almost
suffocated.  I looked ahead.  Long way to go.  Behind
me was the entrance bright and inviting.</p>

<p><p>I forged ahead.  I found that I could barely crawl,
bringing one knee forward at a time.  I could not kneel
on both knees; there was not enough room.  I ambled through a
spider web.  Eww. I hadn&rsquo;t thought about that.  There
seemed to be no spider nearby, nor any insect victims.  Bluh!</p>

<p><p>The inside of the tube was coated in
fine dust, with not so fine gravel collected at the bottom.
Most times the bottom was relatively clean, and I could
do my flattened crawl, brushing my hips and butt against
the top of the tube with each step.  I closed my eyes as
I paced myself through.  I visualized myself suddenly
at the other end.</p>

<p><p>Suddenly, the gravel on the bottom ground into my knees.
I had to resort to my elbows and toes, and I kept my eyes
open.</p>

<p><p>I looked up.  Looked like about half way.  I felt somewhat hot and
had to gently control my breathing to keep my perceived
oxygen level correct.</p>

<p><p>I thought about resting for a second now that I was
halfway through but my brain jumped to the grandest irony:
what if I fell asleep and woke up just before I was somehow
trapped and being exactly in the center, neither end
would be closer for my escape!</p>

<p><p>I kept crawling.  Kept brushing my hips against the top.
Occasionally brushed gravel off my knees with my hand.
I began to sweat.  Fine dust turned into mud on my arms
and hands.  My glasses began to slide off my head.  Kept
crawling.</p>

<p><p>I looked up.  Almost there.  About 25 more feet.  Kept
going until finally I poured myself out of the end onto the ground.</p>

<p><p>Got up.  Oh my gosh I am dirty!  I uselessly brushed
myself off and produced a cloud of dust when I sat in my car.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, Scott.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Drove to work to clean myself off.  I was closer to
work than to home, and I really felt nasty driving my car
like this.</p>

<p><p>Washed my arms up to my elbows and took my shirt off
to soak it in the sink.  I felt relatively certain no one
else was in the building, so I took my shorts off and began
to brush them off with a wet paper towel.</p>

<p><p>Began to wash my knees.  I stretched my right knee up
into the sink and brushed it off gently as the water
rinsed all the dirt off.  Then something kinda poked my
hand. Holy cow what is this?</p>

<p><p>A staple was fully stabbed at an angle into the skin
over my kneecap.  EEEK!!!</p>

<p><p>Felt a bit creepy as I pulled it out.  Tiny puncture
wound.  Little blood.  Umm..  yes tetnus shot is up to
date.  Shudder eewww.</p>

<p><p>Washing the other knee off was significantly less
traumatic, except my cell phone rang.</p>

<p><p>Dug through my shorts pockets to find it.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;HI.  Where are you?&rdquo; It was Wende.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m at work.  In my underwear washing up in the bathroom.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>[pause]  &ldquo;Any particular reason why?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I gave her the brief version of the story.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Rob, I think we&rsquo;ll need to talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>She had called to see if I had called her, but I had not
so we hung up.  I finished cleaning up then got re-dressed
and went into the office.</p>

<p><p>Patrick was there.  I told him a longer version of the
story.  He understood the &ldquo;have to do it; only chance I&rsquo;ll
get&rdquo; kind of thing.</p>

<p><p>Went home and here I am.</p>

<p><p>With Love
<br>- Rob</p>
