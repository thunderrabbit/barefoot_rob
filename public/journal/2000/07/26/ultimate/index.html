<p><p>Ultimate was great tonight!!  I&rsquo;m pleased that I set a goal to play
from 7:30 to 9pm and stuck to that goal (normally I stay until the
very end).  I ran plenty and had one great defensive play early in the
game.  Then Mark L and I were on the team receiving the kick-off, and
he stepped in front of me.</p>

<p><p>I was all, &ldquo;what?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting the disc.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Okay.  I&rsquo;ll run down there and you throw it to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Back left corner?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah I&rsquo;ll fake it toward the center and then zip over there.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Disc was thrown, I sprinted to the middle of the field.  Just as
Mark caught it, I super sprinted right through the crowd, barely
eeking my way around Mike who was like, &ldquo;WHoah!!&rdquo; as I zipped past
him.</p>

<p><p>To the corner disc was coming fast and low and I caught it in a
lovely roll across my back from right shoulder to left hip.  So fine.
Totally ecstatic to have made such a great catch!!  Andy (I think)
likened it to Neo in <em>The Matrix</em> where he does a cartwheel to pick up
the machine gun.  What a great compliment!!</p>

<p><p>Later in the game, I was part of a billiard-like collision.  I
sprinted one way, was slowing down as the disc was turned over and Al
and Raymond started running my way.  Al bounced chest to chest with
me, and I was grabbing his arm to keep him from falling back and then
<em>blam</em> Raymond hit him from behind, the back of Al&rsquo;s head
bonking Raymond&rsquo;s forehead.  Ow!!</p>

<p><p>Raymond had a bump, and I&rsquo;m sure Al did too.  But they both claimed
to be okay as they stood on the sidelines.</p>

<p><p>In my last great play, I was on defense and Shawn had thrown a long
pass toward the end zone.  Tony (offense) and I both ran crazy fast for
it, but he came in at a 90 degree angle to my motion, and offense
always has the right of way in ultimate.  I slowed down so as to not
have a mid-air collision with him.</p>

<p><p>I went home after that play and on the way out saw Sarah and
I-forgot-his-name drive up.  Said HI to them and asked about Java
programming; I&rsquo;m looking for an example of an applet that can read a
text file off its server (while the applet is running on user&rsquo;s
browser).  They didn&rsquo;t have an answer for me.</p>

<p><p>As I drove off, I recognized what I&rsquo;m missing most about Wende
being gone.  I haven&rsquo;t had my quota of hugs!  I have basically not
touched anyone since my I-group on Monday (and crashing into Al
tonight).  And before that I hugged Jennifer and Maggie and Molly on
Saturday.</p>

<p><p>Definitely need more hugs.</p>
