<p><p>On Wednesday, my almost-sister Elise came over after work so she
could spend the night and go back to work early the next morning.  I
enjoy having her over because she&rsquo;s my sister, almost, and I&rsquo;ve never
had a sister this close before (Karina and Alicia are officially
moreso my sisters, but I don&rsquo;t see them as much).  I have sisters!!
Wow!</p>

<p><p>Wednesday is also ultimate day, so I invited Elise to play.  She
did, and it was great!  She did remarkably well for having never
thrown a disc before!  She quickly modified her throws, with no verbal
suggestions from anyone - she just watched and changed her technique
amazingly quickly!</p>

<p><p>I neglected to tell her to bring shoes though; she brought her
sandals (do those Adidas things count as sandals?  more like flip
flops to me) and obviously couldn&rsquo;t run quickly in those.  As quickly
as she honed her tosses, she ripped a huge blister in her big toe.
Ow!!  She wanted it taped so she could play more.  Thanks to Meek for
tape, and she did play more.</p>

<p><p>After the game, Wende and I supported the bandaging of her toe.  I
washed, and Wende got the bandaids and neosporin.  (note: there was no
blood, or I would have brought her home immediately for doctoring.  It
was just that a big floppy flap of the dead skin had ripped off.  She
still had a thin layer of skin intact.)  In an attempt to shift her
experience of the pain, I pointed out the fact that she still had a
layer of skin; no nerves were cut or actually exposed, just relatively
much closer to the surface than they had been.  She was quite brave.</p>

<p><p>All clean then sent Elise down to the guest bedroom to sleep with
the cats.  Goodnight!</p>
