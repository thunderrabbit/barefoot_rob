                        <p><title>Dream: tunnel-trough and cute girl on trampoline video</title>
<p class=date>7:11am CST Sunday 19 November 2000
<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>A tunnel for cars had just been partially unearthed.  I
walked down what was now a trough, toward an apparent underground
series of tunnels; maybe a parking garage.  I became frightened that I
may be hurt by a car not expecting a person in the tunnels, so I
climbed out of the trough and up a large oak tree.  I recognized I was
in the tree where no one had been before; I started out higher than
ground level by climbing to the tree from the trough.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I had found a nest of sorts, consisting of a nice
padded layer of spanish moss in a naturally formed cup in the tree&rsquo;s
branches.  I climbed down so as to not disturb the nest, and because I
didn&rsquo;t want to break any branches that were too small to support my
weight.</p>

<p><p> - - -</p>

<p><p class=dream>A woman I had just met was becoming famous through her
singing or performing and I was at the filming of one of her videos.
There was a large crowd of onlookers and many people wanted to be
chosen to be in her video.  She walked along the crowd of people,
selecting eager faces from the crowd.  I played neutrally interested
and when she looked at me, I gave a slight nod of my head, <em>choose
me.</em></p>

<p><p class=dream>She did choose me, but said something like, if you get
kicked out of the video then don&rsquo;t be upset.</p>

<p><p class=dream>&ldquo;If I get kicked out of the video, you will not be
fired, so don&rsquo;t worry about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>On the way to the set, he hugged me and we barely
kissed, but I was all, &ldquo;Better not kiss me; if someone sees it, you&rsquo;ll
get home and the phone will be ringing, or actually there will already
be messages on your machine.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>We arrived at the set and there was one young man on
the trampoline in pain; he had landed on the side because someone
wasn&rsquo;t watching and blocking to keep him on the trampoline.  The coach
was berating those who hadn&rsquo;t paid attention, but no one was attending
the injured person.  So I asked him if I may touch him.  He fearfully
said yes (fearful of possible extra pain), and I laid my hands gently
on his injured side.  I blessed the healing process and encouraged him
to trust that he would feel better.  Once I finished, he got up and
apparently did feel much better.</p>

<p><p class=dream>We never got another chance to jump on the trampoline;
a large bar was fixed over the trampoline, attached to poles sticking
up at diagonal corners of it.  We began taking the bar down when the
scene shifted.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was looking at a poster and below it was a large 5
gallon bucket filled with candle wax drippings.</p>
