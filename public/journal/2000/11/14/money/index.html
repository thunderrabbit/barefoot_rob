                        <p><title>paying for ticket, work, mutual funds</title>
<p class=date>9:35pm CST Tuesday 14 November 2000</p>

<p><p>Today before work I decided to just pay the parking lot ticket and
be done with it.  As I entered downtown, I was surprised to see at 6
intersections out of 9 cops directing traffic without regards to the
traffic lights.  Even so, our progress seemed too slow for anyone&rsquo;s
own good.  As I <em>finally</em> reached the street on which I
intended to turn toward the courthouse, I found it was blocked.
GRRR!!!</p>

<p><p>Stupid construction.  I-45 is being shredded and the concrete
debris falling onto the streets below could be hazardous.  Well okay,
it&rsquo;s for the greater good.  I-45 will have a cool new entrance / exit
ramps at Allen Parkway.</p>

<p><p>Finally made it to the courthouse and into the parking lot and
found that one of the &ldquo;paths&rdquo; within the parking lot had been
arbitrarily blocked by cones in order to redirect the traffic flow,
resulting in a dead end that was too tight a squeeze for any car
except maybe a Beetle or one of those European cars to turn around.</p>

<p><p>I found myself blocked, but there was a pickup truck pulling out.
I immediately turned into his space and thought, &ldquo;stupid parking lot&rdquo;
for him when he had to drive backwards after he found himself blocked
by the dead end.</p>

<p><p>Into the courthouse, through the metal detectors (I had to turn on
and off my Visor and open up my collapsible keyboard), and to the
cashier who couldn&rsquo;t dismiss the ticket for no insurance (even though
I have proof of insurance), but sent me to the Annex Court (I was
thankful that this court was just down the hall and not down the
street) for processing.</p>

<p><p>Into room 139 where I was told to be seated; I would be called.  5
or 10 minutes later, I was called by the judge.  He messed up my name
at first, but immediately noticed his error and corrected it and
apologized.</p>

<p><p>He saw my proof of insurance and dismissed that ticket without
question.  Then he asked if I wanted to take defensive driving for the
other ticket.  I said I wanted to, but couldn&rsquo;t because I was taking
DD for my other ticket.  He said that he could give the lowest fine
possible and give me time to pay it.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need time to pay it, but certainly I would appreciate the
lowest possible fine.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well, the fine is not a problem - it would be $40, but the court
costs are $61.50.  The City of Houston is very poor and needs to wring
every penny it can out of its citizens,&rdquo; he halfway joked, &ldquo;so you&rsquo;re
looking at a total cost of $101.50.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>With a half smile, half shake of my head, half <em>oh my fucking
god what a fucked up stupid ass system is this?</em> in my mind, I
conceded, &ldquo;okay.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I sat back down and was soon called back up.  I got the receipt and
it said, among other things, &ldquo;no lo contendre&rdquo; (I think), and &ldquo;Total:
$91.50&rdquo; I looked back to thank the judge for somehow getting me $10
off, but he was talking on the phone and didn&rsquo;t see me.  I don&rsquo;t think
he gave me $10 off, but I imagine either (1) he was wrong about the
court fees, or (2) he told me the cost was more than it was so I&rsquo;d
think I got $10 off.</p>

<p><p>No matter what the case, I paid $91.50 because it also said, &ldquo;If
this is not paid immediately, a warrant will be issued for your
arrest.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I paid it, left the building, paid $2.50 to the parking lot guy,
left the parking lot and went to work.</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>Muttering obscenities to myself on the way into the building,
despite my attempt to see the goodness in the overall situation - that
I had been given a relatively cheap lesson in patience (only $91 as
opposed to the man who never learned patience until he had a stroke),
that I was able to pay it and not have to serve jail time or community
service, blah blah blah.. I still felt mad.</p>

<p><p>Okay, so work was cool - I finished the changes to the Sample
survey on my test machine <a
href="https://rabbit.fsd.nu/sample">here</a>.  I installed a CAT 5
cable so Dennis could move a printer away from the hot exterior window
and closer into the middle of the building.  I asked if the specs for
2 pending surveys had been delivered to us, but they had not, so I
have nothing scheduled for tomorrow.</p>

<p><p>Kevin may have me work with Dave on the project he&rsquo;s working on,
and right now I really don&rsquo;t want to do that - I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll get too
frustrated with Dave&rsquo;s coding style, etc.  We&rsquo;ll see what happens.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>After work Wende and I met at Taco Bell and munched, then home
where I transcribed old journal entries and she talked to her pregnant
sister Stacy about holiday plans.  We reviewed some mutual fund sheets
that Jason mailed to us.  I&rsquo;m ready to invest several dollars into a
fund, but Wende wants to do more research.  I really don&rsquo;t know how to
evaluate mutual funds except to see their past performance, so we are
going to ask 3 different brokers (Jason, Wende&rsquo;s current broker, and a
random broker) what mutual funds they suggest given our current
parameters and then we&rsquo;ll make a decision after that.</p>

<p><p>Time for b-e-d bed.</p>
