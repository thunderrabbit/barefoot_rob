<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>Some college kids partying out in the streets and
spraying a garden hose and getting it close to inside our windows.
Wende and I had our windows open and then these kids had a game of
climbing up ladders and spraying and water was just about to get
inside but I closed the windows just as some water sprayed
in.  Then I opened it again, &ldquo;what they hell are you doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re playing a game; we&rsquo;re in hell [and have to keep cool]&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>Their play just wasn&rsquo;t very thoughtful. &ldquo;No you are not
in hell&rdquo; and I grabbed the hose and accidentally sprayed a girl in the
face.  &ldquo;oh I&rsquo;m sorry about that,&rdquo; I assured her.  She was okay.</p>

<p><p class=dream>&ldquo;Hey we were about done anyway; do you want to join us
for pizza at the pizza place behind your house?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>&ldquo;Sure&rdquo; I said, and we did a slap handshake to seal the
deal.</p>

<p><p class=dream>&ldquo;Subway is non smoking, right?&rdquo;  &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;  I wasn&rsquo;t
interested in being in a smokey area, but I figured I could handle it
for an evening.  They all climbed down the ladders and went across to
the pizza place.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Then Adam (from OKC) and BJ (from Sugarland?) arrived
and they both had wacked out haircuts; Adam had a mullett and BJ had a
perm and was wearing a sundress.  Adam showed off his mullett to me
while he was sitting by the buffet line and got gravy on it.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I went over to the pizza place to find the other kids
leaving; this place was unsuitable for them for some reason; they were
going to Rankin Road.  I was all, &ldquo;no; I&rsquo;m not driving up there.&rdquo;
Then I woke up.</p>

<p><p>Interesting how this dream dovetails &ldquo;reality.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p><ol>
<li>Mia Bella, where we ate last night was somewhat smokey, but I
was willing to stay for our friends (who were not smoking).
<li>I had pizza.
<li>Last night Wende and I opened the windows on our house.
<li>Each Sunday this semester, I drive past Rankin Road to the
Northwoods youth group.
</ol></p>

<p><p>With the windows open, it&rsquo;s quite pleasant and even a tad chilly inside!
I&rsquo;d guess it&rsquo;s in the low 70s to high 60s.</p>

<p><p class=date>5:21am</p>

<p><p>Woah!  I just visited the cats downstairs and it&rsquo;s pretty cold down
there!  Like low 60s!!  Craziness!  A couple weeks ago Houston and
Texas were experiencing record high temperatures- like 110 degree
range.</p>

<p><p>Spot is running around maniacally.  I wonder what has him wound
up.  Back to bed for me, but Wende&rsquo;s alarm is about to go off.</p>
