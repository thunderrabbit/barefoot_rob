                        <p><p class=date>1:03am Sunday 3 September 2000</p>

<p><p>Worship was an angel wash and then flower communion.</p>

<p><p>For the angel wash, I saw many people ducking down below the hands before
them.  I simply closed my eyes and walked through without ducking.  My
thinking was that I trust this group enough to not hit me.</p>

<p><p>Later, I found that Sean was very impressed with this. He said that
everyone just raised up to let Rob through.  I feel so honored by this group
that I honor so much.</p>

<p><p>For the flower communion, we each chose a flower (carnation) out of a big
bucket.  Then placed them into a fountain and stated what we give to the
community.   Many people said stuff like &ldquo;love&rdquo; &ldquo;respect&rdquo; &ldquo; dignity&rdquo;
&ldquo;hope&rdquo;..  Steve said, &ldquo;Rocky raccoon&rdquo;.  I said &ldquo;Silent Football.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>now talent show is about to start.</p>

<p><p class=date>1:26 am</p>

<p><p>This is Nancy Pants last rally.  She told her duck joke for the last
time.  Shira has taken the honor of telling the joke at future rallies.</p>

<p><p>Now Ashley is reading <em>The Adventures of Hardcore Bunny and the
Hardcore Pants</em> (or something), written by Annie and Illustrated by
Nick.</p>

<p><p>A line from the book: &ldquo;And anyway, bunnies don&rsquo;t wear pants.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Here is the bridge of the song written for Nancy:</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;nanoonancy look at nancy&rsquo;s pants
<br>her body doesnt move when you watch her dance
<br>tells her silly duck joke at every chance
<br>what color are nancy&rsquo;s pants&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>(Thanks to Sean for typing them for me)</p>

<p><p class=date>2:27am</p>

<p><p>I pretty much fell asleep for the rest of the talent show.</p>

<p><p>Now we are collected for Silent Football.  Nick is dictator.</p>

<p><p>Here are some funny quotes from the game:</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I will now describe the rules, which are needlessly complex and obtuse.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&rdquo;&hellip;the game starts with passing a sacred invisible tastelesss odorless
football.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&rdquo;&hellip;In reverse order of mostness&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Here&rsquo;s the list of who played: Ian, Sean, Aaron, Laura, Ryan, Diane,
Carrie, Kelyn, Lauren, Amelia, Elizabeth, Rob.  We all went by Mr or Miss
(first name) except for Ryan who was Mr Bunny.  He was wearing huge balloon
rabbit ears and carrot.</p>

<p><p class=date>2:49am</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;If two entities lie between Mr Aaron and Mr Dictator, then Mr Aaron
might have known that Mr Aaron could not have had the football&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mr Dictator, endquote.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>2:51am</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I thank Ms Laura for being the first person to point out anything
pointful.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>2:54am</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Actually Miss Elizabeth&rsquo;s actions are quite staraight forward, for Miss
Elizabeth is eating cookies.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mr Aaron, permit me to translate.  When Mr Bunny says &lsquo;and I quote,&rsquo; Mr
bunny means &lsquo;and I quote.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>3:05am</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;If a player does not commit a cold rush of air, then there is no limit
to a player&rsquo;s fwappery.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>3:07am</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;While Mr Bunny is not a physics major, parallel univii do not exist.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hypothetical idiot savantry&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>3:15am</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mr Bunny is hereby given two univii.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>3:22am</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Miss Dianah is going straight to hell!  with a walrus&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>3:31am</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;If I choose to create a fiery pit of hell type annex, then I am
perfectly free to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>3:53am</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mr Universe, I have 4 and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> penance points&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Due to the fact that Miss Dianahs error was funny as shit, Miss Dianah
will get away with that one.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>3:56am</p>

<p><p>Mr Bunny has committed the heinous crime of shrodeming a shrug and thus
loses the game.</p>

<p><p class=date>4:09 am</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;re about to play a second game of Silent Football with me as dictator.
Sean is describing the Silent Football game from New Orleans.</p>

<p><p class=date>4:25am</p>

<p><p>New game begins</p>

<p><p>??? as &ldquo;High Priestess&rdquo;
<br>Sean as &ldquo;Mister The Bibbster&rdquo;
<br>Joan as &ldquo;Miss HeeHeeHee&rdquo;
<br>Phat Pat as &ldquo;Reverand Phat Pat Pattysmack Give a Dog a bone&rdquo;
<br>Lauren as &ldquo;Silent Roberta&rdquo;
<br>Elizabeth as &ldquo;Oreo Both&rdquo;
<br>Rob as any name variation of Mister Dictator, but not &ldquo;Mister Dictator&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>4:45am</p>

<p><p>Reverand Phat Pat Patty Smack Giv a Dog a Bone is trying to recite Little
Bunny Foo Foo</p>

<p><p class=date>4:52am</p>

<p><p>Christina et al tried to fuck up the game and Pat threw a can and hit
someone in the head.  Then they ran off screamng.</p>

<p><p class=date>5:01am</p>

<p><p>Christina and others just came in again and I tried to tell them gently
but I think I made her mad.</p>

<p><p class=date>5:24am</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Maestro Stiffy Chips&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>5:28am</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Mr Phat Pat Pattysmack Give a Dog a Bone will receive penance points for
not remembering Senor Silent Roberta&rsquo;s error and Mr Chair will recieve <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
of one penance points for making noise.</p>

<p><p class=date>5:32am</p>

<p><p>The game ends in a fit of giggles</p>
