                        <p><p class=date>7:06am Sunday 3 September 2000</p>

<p><p>Wake up is rough.  but okay.</p>

<p><p class=date>8:53 am</p>

<p><p>This is Nancy&rsquo;s last rally.  Many of the youth of our two vans would like
to stay for a bit longer and eat at Denny&rsquo;s with Nancy et al.  I believe
that none of the youth necessarily want to go home immediately.</p>

<p><p>However, Evelyn is astonishingly passionate about not going to Denny&rsquo;s.
&ldquo;We advisors make such a committment and give so much of ourselves and&rdquo; and
all this bullshit lumping advisors into one pile.  I&rsquo;m so sad and angry that
she&rsquo;s being such a fucking goddamn bitch about it.  I hope she never drives
with any youth to a rally again.</p>

<p><p class=date>9:15 am</p>

<p><p>I was sitting talking (cooling off) with Susie about it, and Debbie
yelled for us to joing the closing circle.  We&rsquo;re out at closing circle now.</p>

<p><p class=date>9:48 am</p>

<p><p>Hugs and now tumbled into the van.</p>

<p><p class=date>9:56 am</p>

<p><p>Driving now. Tanner is pacing beside us.   But I think he cannot see in
because of tinted windows on the van.</p>

<p><p class=date>10:55 am</p>

<p><p>Ryan is starting a game of Silent Football.</p>

<p><p class=date>11:54 am</p>

<p><p>They&rsquo;re still playing; Rick is still driving, I have been sleeping,  and
Christina has been trying to sleep, but grumbles some variation of &ldquo;shut up&rdquo;
when they are loud.</p>

<p><p>Since a new semester is beginning at KTRU, the KTRU schedule will have
some empty shifts in the wee hous of the night.  I am considering asking for
permission to simply recite the rules to Silent Football as I normally say
them so I can record them for Sean.</p>

<p><p class=date>12:17 pm</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;ve been taking a different route back to Houston; we&rsquo;ll ultimately end
up on highway 59.  Many many small towns with 45 mph sections and stop
lights.  Way slower than on the way up here I am certain.</p>

<p><p>Someone is named Talkie Talkie Robbie Robbie in the Silent Football game.
Very silly.</p>

<p><p class=date>12:38 pm</p>

<p><p>We are in Caddo Oklahoma, stopped at Dairy Queen.  The Silent Football
game is still going strong.</p>

<p><p class=date>1:50 pm</p>

<p><p>Now we&rsquo;re on the road again and we&rsquo;ve done some seat switching so I&rsquo;m in
the back back back seat with Amanda and Christina.</p>

<p><p>Amanda says:</p>

<p><p class=grafitti>Has anyone ever seen a squirrel take a shit?   (&hellip;)</p>

<p><p class=date>2:49 pm</p>

<p><p>Nicole just braided her hair.  Patrick hasn&rsquo;t eaten any bugs on this
trip.  Christina and Amanda relayed the story about the roadies at the show
last night.</p>

<p><p class=date>3:43 pm</p>

<p><p>I just woke up.  The whole van was sleepin&rsquo; except for Rick and Lacy.</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;re at mile marker 260 and just happened to stop for gas.  I&rsquo;ll
probably drive now.</p>

<p><p class=date>4:10 pm</p>

<p><p>On the road again&hellip;</p>

<p><p>Ryan is telling cow knock knock  jokes over the walkie talkies.</p>

<p><p>Phat Pat took Amy&rsquo;s seat in the other van, Christina just heard from Amy.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m still greatly considering driving up to Northwoods each week to be
advisorly with them.</p>

<p><p class=date>5:25 pm</p>

<p><p>Sitting in the back of the van I hear much more interesting stories.</p>

<p><p class=date>5:28 pm</p>

<p><p>Colleen and I are throwing stuff back and forth.  She&rsquo;s in the front
bench seat.</p>

<p><p class=message>hey it&rsquo;s Christina Lusk! Sitting in the back of the van
dyin&rsquo; of heat here!  We are about an hour thirty away. I am going nuts in
the close quarters.  It&rsquo;s all good though.  I keep thinking of Amanda and
Grantly and chillin&rsquo;.  I cried at the end of the rally cause I realized that
I only have 4 left + SWUUSI!  So I&rsquo;m starting to get sad about rallies
ending for me cause they are really starting to get good.  Well, I should
stop rambling and go chill. Love lots,  christina!</p>

<p><p class=date>6:33pm</p>

<p><p>We just looked through a bunch of pics taken by Ryan, .. many from SWUUSI
and from his trip to Europe this summer.  (Amersterdam and Germany and Paris</p>

<p><p>Rick has driven the entire way home.  Wow wow wow wow wow wow wow.  The
most interesting thing about that is Rick drove Fred, Mike and I to and from
Dallas Rally 1990.  I think.  So thankful then and so thankful now.</p>

<p><p>At our last stop, a trailer of cattle was parked near our van.  Nicole
got out to say HI to them, but couldn&rsquo;t decide if they were nice cows that
she could pet.</p>

<p><p class=date>6:37pm</p>

<p><p>Nicole is unbraiding her hair (that she braided a couple of hours ago)
and Ryan is layering it with Amy&rsquo;s.</p>

<p><p class=date>6:39 pm</p>

<p><p>We just passed mile marker 100 on I-45 south</p>

<p><p class=date>6:47 pm</p>

<p><p>Christina is being easily entertained by the zipper on her backpack.</p>

<p><p class=date>6:51 pm</p>

<p><p>We are stopped again to let two youth go pee.  We are so close to being
back!</p>

<p><p class=date>8:06 pm</p>

<p><p>We are parked in the parking lot by the church  Pretty much everyone has
paid up except for a couple of youth and I have high hopes for getting that
money.  Last time I drove, I ended up paying for part of the van.</p>

<p><p class=date>8:47 pm</p>

<p><p>Home.  Shower.  I haven&rsquo;t yet changed clothes this weekend, much less
showered, including the whipped cream pies in my face and hair, including
the dunking tank.  (but I did rinse off the whipped cream before being
dunked)</p>
