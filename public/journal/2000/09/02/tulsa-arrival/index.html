                        <p><p class=date>4:18am Saturday 2 September 2000</p>

<p><p>We have arrived.  Many hugs after the vans were greeted by happy youth.
We just parked them next to the curb and abandoned them.  I grabbed the keys
and all my stuff.  Now I&rsquo;ve found a quiet-ish area to sleep.  Nice carpet.
A tad chilly but my sleepin&rsquo; bag will take care of that nicely.</p>

<p><p>One other advisor sleeping here; it looks like Lee Ann, but I&rsquo;m not sure
of her name.  I&rsquo;m pretty sure I know her face (but she&rsquo;s sleeping face
down.)</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m going to set up my bed and go downstairs to say HI and stuff.</p>

<p><p>I see many youth whose names I don&rsquo;t know  (saw many)   I&rsquo;ll just have to
go learn them.</p>

<p><p>Yay!</p>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s 4:21 am now. I&rsquo;m tired.</p>

<p><p class=date>5:05 am</p>

<p><p>Music blaring, Elizabeth and I are sitting on the couch quizzing and
learning names.  Amber, Beverly, Brian, Nick, Amanda, Bethany, Susie,
Heathre (not misspelled).</p>

<p><p>Noah, Ryan M, A.J. hanging and swinging from the ceiling iron.  Very
primatial.  Psycho even joined them for a bit.</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>Psycho being introduced to Bethany.  Bethany was all, &ldquo;no, really what&rsquo;s
his name?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Psycho.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>so Psycho was all, &ldquo;no, reallly what&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Bethany. &ldquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No, really what is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Very funny.</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p class=grafitti>&ldquo;The time has come,&rdquo; the walrus said, &ldquo;to talk of many
things - of shoes, and ships, and sealing wax - of cabbages and kings, and
why the sea is boiling hot, and whether pigs have wings.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>5:13 am</p>

<p><p>Kellen, Andy, Cassie,</p>

<p><p class=date>5:54 am</p>

<p><p>Nearing name overload, but doing well.  I&rsquo;m upstairs, vaguely on a quest
to find where the T-shirts are.  except this year they are wife beaters.
(tank tops) with a logo on the front and the back.</p>

<p><p>Elizabeth determined that my name-learning crutch was Bryn.  Now that
she&rsquo;s gone to Australia, I am bad at remembering names.  But I think that
the main reason is that I&rsquo;m tired.</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>Elizabeth to me, &ldquo;we need to play Silent Football&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to play.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I laughed.. She believed me!!</p>

<p><p>Bethany says she&rsquo;ll play if we explain the rules.  &ldquo;We always explain
them at the beginning of the game.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>5:58am</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m going to sleep now.</p>

<p><p class=date>6:43 am</p>

<p><p>We just talked to Bryn!!  She said she was all sad that she was missing
the rally then thought, hey, forget that, I&rsquo;ll just call!!  She&rsquo;s talking to
several of the youth here.  She&rsquo;s 15 hours ahead of us so it&rsquo;s 9:43pm
Saturday night there now.  Wow.</p>

<p><p>She said we should come visit now because the airline prices within the
country are ridiculously low for the Olympics.  &ldquo;No, come fly with us!&rdquo;  $66
to fly from Sydney to Brisbane to Mebourne.</p>

<p><p>She said that even though it&rsquo;s winter there, it&rsquo;s all hot and dry and
fires are breaking out everywhere.</p>

<p><p>I told her youth council was great.</p>

<p><p class=date>6:47am</p>

<p><p>Oh!!   I just ran down to tell her she could read about YC online, but
she had only 2 minutes left when I quit talking; they&rsquo;ve hung up now.</p>

<p><p>So I told her briefly about Youth Council and that Laura Douglas got us
$400 to visit another district so we&rsquo;re going to come down to see her.
Elizabeth was all, &ldquo;I get to go!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I said, &ldquo;true&rdquo; about something and she said that they just didn&rsquo;t get it
down there.  I was all, &ldquo;tell them that all Americans say true and false
instead of yes and no.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>The phone connection was wonderfully clear.</p>

<p><p class=date>6:50am</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m going back to bed.</p>
