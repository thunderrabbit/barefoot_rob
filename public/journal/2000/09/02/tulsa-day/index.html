                        <p><p class=date>10:10 am</p>

<p><p>awake.  AJ&rsquo;s voice in the hall woke me up.  He tried to lie and say it
wasn&rsquo;t him.  He wasn&rsquo;t really trying to lie so much as he was just not
willing to admit that he was in error for hollering near the advisor
sleeping area.</p>

<p><p class=date>10:57 am</p>

<p><p>Sat in on Adam&rsquo;s touchgroup, got some information on upcoming workshops
and carnival festivities.  Then we all told something that people couldn&rsquo;t
tell by looking at us.  I told peeps that I had a masectomy of my left
breast.</p>

<p><p>So Ryan said, &ldquo;So, for a while, you didn&rsquo;t have a boob.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Um, no.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just kiddin&rsquo; I just wanted to say &lsquo;boob&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>me imitating Beavis or Butt-Head &ldquo;huh huh you said &lsquo;boob&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Ran around randomly and hugged Oliver who is leaving for Maine.  See ya,
Oliver.</p>

<p><p class=date>11:01am</p>

<p><p>Now I&rsquo;m in balloon workshop.</p>

<p><p>This guy is sibling of Stevie.  He has dry humor, and pretty funny.</p>

<p><p>First balloon animal:  Worm.  2nd snake.  3rd a lizard with all its legs
cut off.</p>

<p><p>His name is Dustin.  He can tie a balloon with one hand.</p>

<p><p class=date>11:08 am</p>

<p><p>We all made dogs.  I made a 6 legged dog.</p>

<p><p class=date>11:13 am</p>

<p><p>We all made hats</p>

<p><p class=date>11:25 am</p>

<p><p>We all made different shape dogs</p>

<p><p class=date>11:28 am</p>

<p><p>I made a dog with wheels.</p>

<p><p class=date>11:35 am</p>

<p><p>I made a somewhat bent baloon in attempt to make a piral.  Special thanks
to Sean for helping me pump it up.</p>

<p><p>Yes, while Dustin The Balloon guy can blow one up with one breath, Sean
and I have to use one of Dustin&rsquo;s balloon pumps.</p>

<p><p class=date>11:38 am</p>

<p><p>Phat Pat just made the large intestine.</p>

<p><p class=date>11:45 am</p>

<p><p>He&rsquo;s showing people how to make a flower.  I just made a something with
no end.</p>

<p><p class=date>11:55 am</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;re not worthy!!  Dustin just inflated a ballon, kept it straight, shot
it up at the ceiling and it stuck there.  As if it were just lying on the
floor but it&rsquo;s on the ceiling.</p>

<p><p class=date>12:02 pm</p>

<p><p>Phat Pat just made a fishing pole with string and hook and caught a fish,
all in balloon.</p>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s so cool to see all the wonderful creativity in the room.</p>

<p><p class=date>12:05 pm</p>

<p><p>Sean and I made a figure 8, or infinity symbol, all freestyle.</p>

<p><p>[smak!!]</p>

<p><p class=date>12:19 pm</p>

<p><p>Dustin made us a rubber bullet and showed us how to launch it out of a
balloon. Sean just shot a rubber bullet.</p>

<p><p class=date>1:37 pm</p>

<p><p>We quit making stuff and pretty much just shot a lot of rubber bullets
around the room.</p>

<p><p>Phat Pat made a drink holder that attaches to his arm and is supported
with a sling thing around his neck.  It held a full coke, but he seemed
never to find a straw so he never could drink it.</p>

<p><p>Lunch was breads and soup; I mixed all three soup varieties - vegetable,
tomato, and chicken tortilla.  plus a cookie and lemon bread.  very nice.</p>

<p><p>YAC meeting now or soon actually as people are gathering, they were
sleepin.</p>

<p><p>- - - - -</p>

<p><p>After the YAC meeting, most of the rally youth joined forces to create
some childrens&rsquo; books that will be used in a local shelter or something.</p>

<p><p class=date>6:16 pm</p>

<p><p>I noticed a youth not with the rest of the group.  I sat next to her to
see if I could help.  I talked for quite a while with Angela, whose first
rally this is.  I&rsquo;m pleased that she seems much happier and hanging out with
people more than when I saw her sitting alone.</p>

<p><p>We had touchgroup meeting and played a get-the-group-across-the-lava
game.  They did quite well, but were not impressed enough to play again.</p>

<p><p>Now we are playing Mental Clue, and have been for over an hour.  Me, Amy,
Adam, Hillary, Sean, Elizabeth.
The game is based on the board game Clue:  Each person in the circle think
of a person, place, and weapon.  Then people try to guess what they are
thinking.  The thinker tells the guesser how many answers they got correct.</p>

<p><p>Now we&rsquo;re about to play frisbee.</p>

<p><p class=date>8:11 pm</p>

<p><p>disc was great fun.  We played through sunset in the parking lot.
Angela&rsquo;s throwing got progressively better through the evening.   Then I
grabbed Travis&rsquo; unicycle and rode around the parking lot a lot.  I even rode
up and down the parking lot with about a 5% grade (I&rsquo;m guessing about the
grade).</p>

<p><p>I even helped Whitney ride the uni about 2 revolutions worth.</p>

<p><p>Now I&rsquo;m &lsquo;bout to drop off all my gear (camera, visor, wallet) at my bed
and go visit the Conival  &ldquo;con&rdquo; (conference) plus carnival)</p>

<p><p class=date>12:03am  Sunday 3 September 2000</p>

<p><p>Conival was great; I was recruited to get pie in the face (pie tins with
whipped cream) and then I had a fun stint in the dunk tank.  I counted 37
balls thrown and not one hit the thing to dunk me.  #38 did it.</p>

<p><p>Sean got to be the dunkee and taunted me to throw balls to knock him in.
I threw one with my eyes closed and missed.  The second one I threw I
knocked him in.  I didn&rsquo;t use my third shot.  Amy said, &ldquo;stopping while
you&rsquo;re ahead, eh?&rdquo;   &ldquo;Yep!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>But now I&rsquo;m wondering if I could have gotten two in a row..   Hmmm</p>

<p><p>There was a band and some concern about their &ldquo;groupies&rdquo;.. friends that
they apparently invited to watch them perform.  Pretty much nothing happened
that I saw, but some youth felt uncomfortable.</p>

<p><p>Cleanup was pretty long after the conival, &hellip;  Matt and I yelled/recited
DMX &ldquo;y&rsquo;all gon make me lose my cool, up in heah, up in heah&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Made different lyrics and fun.</p>

<p><p>Psycho and I <em>ran</em> with a big cart of chairs, nearly crashing
through doors, but we made such a ruckus that people moved shit out of the
way, opened doors, moved chairs&hellip;  we just blasted through.</p>

<p><p>Talked to Susie about possibly being local advisor type person for youth
at Northwoods church..  basically my original YRUU stomping grounds.
Northwoods was where I attended my first rally and all that.</p>

<p><p>My understanding is that they need an advisor and I am certainly free on
Sundays and interested in reconnecting with the church and the youth, many
of whom I knew as 4 and 5 year olds way back when.</p>

<p><p class=date>12:11 am</p>

<p><p>Many peoples are sleeping, but many more are loudly congregating in the
dining hall.  I think for worship and or talent show.</p>
