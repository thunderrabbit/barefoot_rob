                        <p><p class=date>7:44 am Saturday 23 September 2000</p>

<p><p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>riding my bike through a scary old house / neighborhood that
I remembered (in my dream) I had been through it before.  (I don&rsquo;t know if i
have dreamed it before)</p>

<p><p class=dream>It was a run down place where some poor people lived in
poverty and I felt a bit nervous going through it, but I wound my way back
left and right turns through sneaky little rooms and openings and I got
through.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Met Wende and Tammy (ex ex ex ex ex girlfriend) once we got
out and she asked if I had found a spot to play silent football and I told
her that it was too scary in there for us to want to play in there.</p>

<p><p class=dream>She was like, okay and that was it.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Then Wende and I were driving in my old car (Olds Omega) and
she was flipping through a book .. no it was a CD by a guy from an artist we
have a KTRU a CD he had made of famous quotes being read by present day
famous people.  Wende was flipping through the lyric book as the CD played.</p>

<p><p class=dream>The guys house was right down the street, so I was going to
show up at his door and buy a CD from him.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Wende was nervous about the idea; what if he wasn&rsquo;t there or
if something bad happened..   So we pulled into a gas station (on the other
side of the street from where we would have turned to go to Chris&rsquo; house)
and the gas station turned into an old large car garage with junk everywhere
and dirt floor and a big tin building for garage.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Wende wanted to ask a question of a woman who was smoking in
the car next to us, but I was all, don&rsquo;t let any smoke get inside our car.
So Wende jumped into her car without getting smoke into our car and
actuallly got into their car.  I was surprised at this, but I figured it was
some girl talk and was okay.  In their girl talk exuberance, Wende got a
slight cigarette burn on the side of her face.  Ow!!  but she didn&rsquo;t
complain about it more than, &ldquo;hey, watch that!&rdquo; I was outside of my car
walking around and found a penny from the  year 2005 and was all, &ldquo;this must
be a dream!&rdquo; so I showed it to a guy and said what year is this penny?  &ldquo;It
expires in 2005&rdquo; he said..  &ldquo;do you know what that means?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p><p class=dream>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>&ldquo;it means I am dreaming!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>He didn&rsquo;t understand the significance.  and I said, it means
we can fly!  then Christine walked up (and I said to myself this also means
we are dreaming (!)) and I said forget flying and I started kissing
Christine on the neck and hugging her and kissing her on the neck and face.
I was totally making out with her in my dream and aware that Wende must be
sleeping beside me and I began to lose the dream and I recognized that I was
<em>actually</em> kissing Wende who way laying on top of me!  I could feel her
weight and we were kissing and I was still dreaming of kissing Christine.
Then we quit kissing and I spoke to Wende about the dream.</p>

<p><p class=dream>There was some anger, and I was all, &ldquo;it was like our dreams
crossed.&rdquo;  I was all &ldquo;did you dream about a big garage thing&rdquo;  I was going
to tell her about the 2005 penny and we really didn&rsquo;t discuss much.</p>

<p><p>Then Will called and we woke up for real.</p>
