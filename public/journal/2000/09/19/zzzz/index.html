<p class=date>11:31pm CDT Tuesday 19 September 2000</p>

<p><p><h1>shredder</h1></p>

<p><p>After work I went to Office Max to price shredders.  Wende had
purchased a shredder for $19 from Target.  This shredder shredded into
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; strips of paper.  Wende wondered if she would be happier with a
crosscut shredder.  I believe yes, if she is questioning her purchase.</p>

<p><p>I found a cool crosscut shredder for $59 minus a $10 instant rebate
to be taken at the register.  I figured, &ldquo;<shrug> $49 is pretty close
to $19; I&rsquo;ll just get this shredder.&rdquo;  I considered taking the tag
that indicated the sale price in case the cashier had any doubts.  I
chose not to bring it up;</p>

<p><p>Turns out that the $10 off thing was an old sale, but I walked back
to the shredder area and showed her the indicated price.  She let me
have the $10 off.  Yay!</p>

<p><p>On my way out of the store, I saw Carlos, who lives in the
apartment below my ex-apartment.  I couldn&rsquo;t remember his name, but we
talked and he asked if I had a VGA monitor that he could have.  In
fact I do have an old monitor, and I offered it to him for $20.  Turns
out that it&rsquo;s CGA!  Why am I holding on to this old ass monitor?
Well, because the switch is not a monitor switch, but a pull-chain
light switch that I installed on the monitor.  It works and I love it.
Maybe I&rsquo;ll install a light switch on this monitor so I can get rid of
the old one.</p>

<p><p><h1>movie</h1></p>

<p><p>Wende and I ate soup and crackers and watched <em>My Best Friend&rsquo;s
Wedding</em>.  I totally loved Kimmi (sp) played by Cameron Diaz.  We
were entertained to see older brother from &ldquo;Malcom In The Middle&rdquo; on
FOX Sunday nights.</p>

<p><p>Near the end of the movie, when Julia Roberts&rsquo; character had just
lied by omission about everything possible, I was quite
anti-impressed with the movie.  They turned it all around though and I
enjoyed the ending.  There&rsquo;s just something about Cameron.</p>

<p><p><h1>WHASSSAAAAAAAaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaPPP</h1></p>

<p><p>Dude called and I answered like the beer commercial.  I hated those
commercials when Dude first told me about them.  But now I think it&rsquo;s
pretty funny, if a bit old now.  (For the record, I wish to say that
Marcel and I used to say &ldquo;WHAAASSSSUUUUUUUUUP!!!!!!&rdquo; during college
way back in 1993 and 1994).  He invited me to Mission Burrito so I
went to his house and rode in his new Toyota Tundra to MB.</p>

<p><p><h1>burrito</h1></p>

<p><p>Dude got a grilled shrimp burrito.  I had water and some of his
chocolate chip cookie.  We talked computer shit; I explained to him
about SAS and work.  He described his latest projects.  He is greatly
considering going freelance web design again.  After working for a
year or so for T1.com and now idea.com, he&rsquo;s got a pretty good basic
concept of what it takes to make a website.  A huge leap better than
what he and I did with MR Laboratories.</p>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s 23:52 now.  I&rsquo;m going to bed.</p>
