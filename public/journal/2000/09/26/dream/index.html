<p class=date>6:53am CDT Tuesday 26 September 2000</p>

<p><p>(Oh my god it&rsquo;s so cold!)</p>

<p><p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was on a train traveling through the country in the
early 1800s.  A native american &ldquo;Indian&rdquo; was on the train and planned
to ambush it as the train drove over a river.</p>

<p><p class=dream>My point of view shifted to down beside the tressel
(bridge) where a couple of junk cars (circa 1960) were all smushed and
dumped there.  As the train trucks (wheels) crossed the bridge, the
cars reverberated with a drumming sound.  The engineer got scared and
stopped the train and it was overrun by settlers who climbed up out of
the river to grab a dollar or two each.</p>

<p><p class=dream>As the settlers left their hiding spots, I went behind
them and stole the money they had already stolen.  About $51, which I
realized was almost a fortune back then.  I thought about putting it
into a retirement account in the 1850s so it would be a real fortune
in the early 2000s.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I had to get back across the river without them seeing
that I had taken their money as they all were coming back to their
homes after having robbed the train.  I just casually swam backwards,
making sure the water current would keep my swim trunks &ldquo;inflated&rdquo;
instead of mashed against my skin, thereby hiding the small wad of
bills in my pocket.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I arrived back at the train and took a shower in our
hotel room where Wende and I were staying with Christina and Lee.
After my shower, I was at Christina&rsquo;s house, and she was showing off
her stuff around the house.  Everything from the big tree in the
driveway to little bunny rabbits and their car.  I held and petted one
of the little rabbits and he was purring purring purring so loudly; it
was really surprising such a little rabbit could purr so loudly.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Someone came over with 2 little poodle dogs and they
looked all happy, but I put my ear up to the rabbit to hear him
purring and I could hear the poodles&rsquo; thoughts through the rabbit&rsquo;s
ear.  The poodles were in a pissy mood from what they were saying.</p>
