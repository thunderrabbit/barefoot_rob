                        <p><p class=date>12:04 pm Friday 8 September 2000</p>

<p><p>Maggie, Wende, and I are at Cafe Adobe munching lunch before we go see
<em>Whipped</em>, starring the lovely Amanda Peet.</p>

<p><p>A cool thing is a water fountain outside.  It&rsquo;s got normal upward
sprayers in the middle and then very pure pristine angled in squirters
around the perimeter.  The angled in ones are pretty cool, but I must say
the ones in Chicago were way more precise and perfect.</p>

<p><p>These are certainly nice, and these are now doing a weird dance wobbly
water thing (not by changing the angle but by changing the pressure).</p>

<p><p>Maggie is describing how she was stuck in Chicago for an extra day for a
work related project thing.  She has the sense that she was held over for a
day so that she could tell a man that he was a good person.  See, she saw
this guy on the last dayshe was supposed to be there and had a feeling that
she was supposed to tell him, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a good person.&rdquo;  She couldn&rsquo;t get the
nerve to do it, and was held up a day.  The next day she saw the man again
and felt the feeling even more strongly.  She never did speak to him.</p>

<p><p>Now as she describes the story, she&rsquo;s saying she wishes she had told him.</p>

<p><p>Now Maggie says, &ldquo;Rob loves his keyboard.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>This is true.</p>

<p><p>Heather is our waitress.  She looks like the girl from <em>Chasing
Amy</em> who looks like Rene Zelwegger (sp).</p>

<p>1:01 pm</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m in the screening room now of the theater.  The girls are peeing (in
separate restrooms).  There&rsquo;s only about a few hundred seats in this room;
it looks like <em>Whipped</em> is not going to be shown very long.   They&rsquo;re
not expecting big crowds.</p>

<p><p>Sigh.  poor oh-so-cute Amanda Peet.</p>

<p><p>Oh my gosh guess what!!   Dude&rsquo;s friend Maz <em><em>knows</em></em> the guys who
wrote and directed <em>Whipped</em> and one of them is boyfriend of Amanda
Peet!  That&rsquo;s how they got her in the film, and that means that I&rsquo;m  I&rsquo;m
only 4 steps away from Amanda Peet!!!  Wow!  And really I have met Maz and
he&rsquo;s cool and would pretty much remember me, so I&rsquo;m only three steps away
from Amanda Peet.  Wow!</p>

<p><p>The first trailer was for <em>Unbreakable</em>. I was all, &ldquo;Wende watch
this!!&rdquo;  I didn&rsquo;t blink through the entire trailer; I love it!</p>

<p><p>Trailer for <em>Buying The Cow</em> looks pretty funny to Wende, and
probably to me.</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>So we saw <em>Whipped</em>.  Very funny film once I got past how
chauvanistic these characters are.  Their languge is gutter terrible, but I
don&rsquo;t mind it at all.   I don&rsquo;t have as big of a crush on Amanda Peet
anymore; her character was a lot more cute in <em>The Whole Nine Yards</em>.</p>

<p><p>Here are two funny lines that I wrote during the film:</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;First of all it&rsquo;s jujitsu, faggot.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay; being gay is kinda hip now.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>After the movie, we ate at Maggie Moo&rsquo;s, a small ice cream shop like
Marble Slab or Amy&rsquo;s.  Maggie Moo&rsquo;s has a Thelma or Louise looking cow
character as their mascot.</p>

<p><p>See ya.</p>
