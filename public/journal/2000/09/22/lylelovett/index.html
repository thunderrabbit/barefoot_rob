                        <p><p class=date>6:48pm Friday 22 September 2000</p>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve used my cute little Handspring Visor.  I&rsquo;m
now at Hobby Airport, soon to meet Miss Wende, arriving at Gate 4 from
Dallas Love.</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;re going to Lyle Lovett concert tonight, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to
being with Wende, but not particularly looking forward to the concert.  But
Rocky said I might like it.</p>

<p><p>Work was ucky again today.  Again today I was super anti impressed with
Dave&rsquo;s code.  I found some errors in it - type-o kinda things and it was
just a mess of emails that people sent cause the shit wasn&rsquo;t working
correctly.</p>

<p><p>Kevin even cut his vacation short to patch stuff up, and I&rsquo;m really glad
for myself that I am here almost with Wende instead of there in the muck of
crappy code.</p>

<p><p>Kevin left on Wednesday, expecting to come back on Monday.  Little did he
know that he&rsquo;d be back on Friday late.</p>

<p><p class=date>8:28 pm</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;ve arrived in the parking area of the Woodlands Pavillion, and Wende
is changing clothes in the back of the truck.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Tonight,&rdquo; says Wende, &ldquo;I would just like to.. in the spirtit of
didn&rsquo;t-get-the-cats-fed, and kinda it&rsquo;s-all-just-little-details, I would
like to have the freedom to buy a shirt or a ten dollar pretzel or whatever
tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;okay,&rdquo; I say.   I&rsquo;m pretty sure she doesn&rsquo;t know I typed all that.</p>

<p><p>See, I forgot to feed the cats before picking up Wende and I pretty much
all &ldquo;DOH!!!&rdquo; about that.  I had planned to feed them between work and
getting Wende, but work was so stinky that I forgot.  I&rsquo;d like to blame
someone besides myslef.  but there is no blame.</p>

<p><p>sucks because we&rsquo;re going to my dad&rsquo;s house tonight and he lives close to
here, but we have to go waaay back home first.  We may or may not drive back
to my dad&rsquo;s tonight.</p>

<p><p class=date>9:08 pm</p>

<p><p>We have just now sat down by Elaine and her man in the lawn.  Had to walk
and get tickets and then stopped for water and nachos and a shirt.</p>

<p><p>Soon as we really sat down, he was all talking &ldquo;sometimes you can look at
people and tell things about them.. like you can tell when a couple has just
met, and you can tell when a couple has been married for a long time..
maybe you can look out here and see which part of the couple had the idea to
come out here tonigght and which part is just being supportive&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I cheered at that.</p>

<p><p class=date>10:30 pm</p>

<p><p>Just as I was about to write how bored I am, though some songs are
interesting I was all, &ldquo;ugh, let&rsquo;s go home.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>The cello guy just did a 2 or 3 minute cello solo that ruled.  oh wow
that was so fly.  That was my favorite part of the concert.</p>

<p><p>Now everyone is clapping (except me and it&rsquo;s some preachin&rsquo; song.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;If the preacher preaches long enough, even he&rsquo;ll get hungry too.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Oh, while I have this out, special thanks to Will who said he will feed
the cats tomorrow morning.  About feeding them tonight, Wende said, &ldquo;Peter
can stand to go hungry for one night.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>This may be the last song; he is thanking us for being a wonderful
audience.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Thanks to all my friend and family for being here.&rdquo;  (He had said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
kin to most of y&rsquo;all; thank you for coming out anyway.&ldquo;)</p>

<p><p>- - - - -</p>

<p><p>One of the gospel singers has a wow wow wow low deep voice.</p>

<p><p>They just did one encore and left the stage but Wende said she&rsquo;ll cry
great big tears if they don&rsquo;t play long tall texan.</p>

<p><p>No he came back.. now singing &ldquo;6 foot 7.&rdquo;  this has to be it.</p>

<p><p>No this is San Antonio Girl and Wende isn&rsquo;t ecstatic.</p>

<p><p>Please play it LL.</p>

<blockquote><p>(I am bummed that I didn't save an AIM chat between me an'
Rocky from today.  It was funny.

<p>I was all, guess who we're going to see tonight ?

<p>LL?

<p>OH MY GOSH YOU'RE RIGHT!!

<p>And then some crack about A and M and then "Have you ever heard of the
Chicken?" I asked Rocky.  "HAHAHAHA"

<p>I'm not even going to answer that.

<p>"The question should be" Rocky said, "How many times have you gotten
thrown out of the chicken?"

</blockquote>

<p><p>That&rsquo;s funny.</p>

<p><p class=date>10:51 pm</p>

<p><p>San An Girl song is over and now a fiddle song about trucks, but no Long
Tall Texan song.</p>

<p><p class=date>10:55 pm</p>

<p><p>kpft broadcast them on the radio.</p>

<p><p>now it&rsquo;s acapella with piano</p>

<p><p>maybe I can get a recording from them.</p>

<p><p>it&rsquo;s so hilarious how wende never reads my journal so I can tell all my
plans and she&rsquo;ll not find out until they happen.  and she won&rsquo;t be
disappointed if they don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p><p>anway, I haven&rsquo;t done the ring thing yet, but I do know her ring size
now.  I went to get one of Wende&rsquo;s rings this AM, but she had taken them
all.  She&rsquo;s a size 6.5.</p>

<p><p>audio just went screwy.  we lost audio in back speakers.</p>

<p><p>hmm</p>

<p><p class=date>10:59 pm</p>

<p><p>Show is finally over.    no long tall texan song.</p>
