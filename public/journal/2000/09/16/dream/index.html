<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p>A demonstration against the countries with dictatorship governments.
People were all, &ldquo;o - Cuba is so terrible&rdquo; blah blah blah.  and some
other people who were actually from Cuba were all, &ldquo;hey, what are you
talking about?&rdquo; and told the group how the United States secretly has
just as terrible of practices as these other countries, but simply
covers them up.</p>

<p>This man was speaking very passionately for people to open their eyes
o what&rsquo;s around them; he offered personal stories of his family.  Ten
there was some type of shift and this man was on a bus, driving down a
riverbank beside a highway bridge that crossed the river.  The bus
didn&rsquo;t stop, plunged into the river and some people started to climb
out, but this man did not.  I was on top of the highway bridge and
determined to leap from the bridge into the water to save this man and
a couple of other people on the bus (the other people were some of my
youth).  I ran over to my dad who was also on the bridge and said,
&ldquo;time me!&rdquo;  and I tossed my Handspring Visor and keyboard over to him.
I was referring to <em>time how long it takes me to hit the water when
I jump</em>.  I got right to the edge of the bridge to jump and woke
up.</p>
