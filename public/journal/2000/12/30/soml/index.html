                        <p><title>State of My Life Address 30 December 2000</title>
<p class=date>8:35am CST Saturday 30 December 2000</p>
<p class=note>(partially transcribed out of my diary)</p></p>

<p>I cannot believe how long it's been since I've written!!!  I'm so
totally sorry to have neglected you.</p>

<p>ACTUALLY I'm just kiddin'.  I've been writing on my website
www.robnugen.com.  The truth is that I've basically entirely switched
over to writing online instead of physically writing in here.</p>

<h3>STATE OF MY LIFE ADDRESS 30 DEC 2000</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>I'm not that amazed with the new year.  After the zeroes rolled
over the yeardometer, nothing can really top that.  Maybe 2222 but
probably not even that.  I will live that long, you know.  That's why
and because I'm learning new stuff all the time.</p></li>

<li><p>I can ride a unicycle!  Basically I learned in one year.  Now I
can ride up humps and down curbs.  I can't go up curbs yet nor jump
over anything, but I'll keep practicing.  Actually I haven't tried to
jump.  Maybe I will today.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm at the laundry mat now washing (actually drying (actually
watching the dryer spin as it apparently dries)) ANYWAY I'm washing
the comforter.  It was still relatively covered in cat hair when I got
it out of the big washer.</p></li>

<li><p>Wende and I are about to start "marriage" (we're not married
yet) counseling.  She's been not feeling horny and I've been unable to
not feel horny it seems.  That's one bottom line dynamic.  Also she's
been working a ton to keep the house clean while I have not as much
even though she is at work more than me (even though I think she
doesn't have to be)</p></li>

<li><p>I've written a cool generic model at work - actually 2
different ones.</p>

<ol type=I>
<li><p>One is geared toward 360 Feedback surveys: ("I" rate myself and
am rated by peers, direct reports, managers.  then "I" get a compiled
report of ratings, then try to improve on these areas that apparently
need improvement.  This model requires "me" to request feedback from
certain people who may or may not be in our dataset (add them if not)
and they get emails sent to them with unique username & password.
They log in to our site, have to change their password, and then
provide feedback for "me" or others like "me" who have requested their
feedback.</p>

<p>So I've made a generic version of this model that uses</p>

<pre>
username dataset:
<em>userid</em> | name | email | class | etc

ratings dataset:
<em>userid</em> | may rate userid | responses | etc

question dataset:
text | anchortype

anchor dataset:
<em>anchor type</em> | text | value

OH! and class dataset:
<em>classnum</em> when-to-send-emails | etc
</pre>

<p>I'm almost to the point where I can specify several variables at
the beginning (or have a new DS that defines them... Oh my God I just
figured something...</p>

<p>Overview dataset:</p>

<pre>
<em>project name</em> | title | program 1 | program 2 | program 3
</pre>

<p>and if there had to be something So Different about a project then
I could specify different code for that project's program 3, for
example.  Wow.  I may do this.)
</p></li>

<p><hr align="left" width="33%"> <center>Back to SOML</center> <hr
align="right" width="33%"></p>

<li><p>The other generic is an occupational health survey.  It uses
only 1 program to print all the different pages of the survey and
encoded into the question dataset is how to present the
questions.</p></li>
</ol>
</li></ul>

<p>The comforter is dry.  I'm going back home and I'll finish this
online & paste it in here.</p>

<p class="date">10:19am</p>

<p>As I typed the stuff above, I recognized how much faster I type
than I write.  Therefore it seems to me that it must be the case that
I have far more entries now that I'm writing them online than I would
have if I still wrote them on paper.</p>

<p>continuing with SOML Address:</p>

<p><ul>
<li><p>I have not yet met Jerry, who also rides a unicycle.  I have
virtually met him online - we have exchanged emails and might go ride
later today at Herman Park</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>I have just recently signed both Wende and I up to take a
quickie free spanish class on 9 January 2001.  At that class, I will
ask the instructor what level of class I should take next.  I&rsquo;m going
to learn spanish this year.</p></li></p>

<p><li><p>The Houston Rally is coming soon.  I have a concern about the
enforcement of our NO WALK-INs policy.  It will really suck to have to
turn people away if they don&rsquo;t pre-register.  But I think that after
the craziness at San Antonio (25 walk-ins), and the subsequent meeting
with YAC, people won&rsquo;t do it.  For those YRUUers reading this who need
to register, visit the website <a
href="https://swd.yruu.org">website</a> and click on Upcoming Events
(or the big link at the top of the page)</p></p>

<p>I am officially in charge of this rally, but I have done relatively very
little work to make it happen.  Delegation and Youth Empowerment have
made this easy!  Not everything has been exactly as *I* would have
done it, but that's to be expected.</p>

<p>Big jobs that I haven't done:</p>

<ol>
<li>Registration.  Katherine is registrar.</li>
<li>buying the T-shirts.  JoAnne did that</li>
</ol>

<p>I have a concern that registration and touch groups will be wacky,
but I trust that the youth can achieve more amazing things than I
could ever do.</p>

<p>Another big job that hasn't been done yet is ordering food.  The
youth are doing something new for food stuff this year; we will see
how it's working out on 7 January, our next meeting.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been writing relatively lots of letters (snail mail)
lately.  To receive good snail mail I write good snail mail.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't shut down the Feel Good Net mailing list, but I also
haven't sent a message to it in a long time.  I think I'll send a
final message and close the list.  Maybe today.</p></li>

<li><p>I have offered up the Ringmaster position of The Webring For
People Named Rob, and one Rob said he was interested, and I told him
what he needed to do, but he hasn't done it.</p></li>

<li><p>My dad has ordered a new 45Gig hard drive and is therefore
giving me his old 13Gig hard drive as a gift!  I remember when Tammy
and I spent $300 on a 143Meg hard drive.  This 13Gig hard drive is
essentially 13 thousand Megs, almost 100 times the capacity of the
$300 drive back in 1992 or so.  Amazing.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm considering thoroughly updating the code that displays my
journal entries.  I want to rewrite it so that the <em>prev :
next</em> links work over the month and year boundaries.  Also so that
one can select prev or next month from the index on the left.  That
will be cool.</p>

<p>I might also write a shockwave version.</p>

<p>I'm imagining the link on the front of my site linking to a page
that offers HTML Version or Shockwave version, and a checkbox that
says "Remember this choice" which will write a cookie to the user's
machine so that they just go to the correct version next time. That
will be way cool.</p></li>

<li><p>Tomorrow night I will join the youth group in staffing a
concession stand at a fireworks extravaganza in The Woodlands.  The
group will be paid $36 per hour.  We hope to have more than 6 people
there so we can share the work and play and have a grand ol'
time.</p></li>

<li><p>emacs is working on removing the nineteenth ring (again).  This
is where I accidentally stopped it last time.</p></li>
