<p>Rob,
    Concerning your cat theory, include Maggie&rsquo;s cats in your data
points to see if they fit.  Mixie meows but usually if you talk to her
first.  Mischief and Julius rarely &ldquo;talk&rdquo; but will sometimes.  Let me
know what you think.</p>

<p>Love,
Molly</p>

<p>Cats that live outside Beltway 8 are entirely different and therefore
outside the scope of my theory.  However, the area between 610 loop and
Beltway 8 is even worse to study, because there is some mixing of breeds
and what we call Cross Concentric Pollenation.</p>

<p>I see.  Is that based on where cats live or where they were born?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s based on where they were born in their most recent of 9 Lives.  Cats
are quite adaptable; their genes mutate slightly on each rebirth, depending
on their geographic location at the time.</p>

<p>But were Wende&rsquo;s cats even born in Houston?  Mixie and Julius are from the
terrible between 610 and beltway 8 sector.  I think Mischief may be the
same.  Do you remember Spencer&rsquo;s meowing habits?</p>

<p>Originally they may not have been born in Houston.  However, Peter is now
on Life 5 after he ate an entire 50 gallon garbage bag.  Tinkerbell is on
Life 4 after she fought Peter for food and he sat on her.</p>

<p>Spencer was from The Sector.  He would meow at seemingly random occassions;
but we eventually discovered it was only when an episode of I Love Lucy was
playing somewhere within a 100 Meow radius.  (1 Meow is the distance King
Chlawdomer, a Meowrovingian King (511-524) could be heard when he meowed on
a calm day.)</p>

<p>I see.  I think the rules must be very complex concerning meowing habits.
Maybe it is one of the unanswerable questions like, &ldquo;How do cats purr?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Absolutely.  What is your theory on it?</p>

<p>My purring theory is that cats have a major conspiracy.</p>

<p>1)  There is no surefire way to predict when a cat will purr &ndash; as a species
or individually.  The only exception is Peter in whose case we have to say
&ldquo;There is no surefire way to predict when Peter will not purr.&rdquo;  I think
cats purposefully try to mislead us on this matter.  In the same way, I
purposefully wait and plan on when I will be able to trip Will.  In this
way, my attempt will be an unexpected surprise.</p>

<p>2)  Researchers have not been able to determine how a cat produces a &ldquo;purr&rdquo;.
I believe this is due to special quick dissolve hormones.  These are used so
quickly and break down so completely, that the presence of the compound has
never been detected.  These hormones actually act as a sounding board which
air in the lungs &ldquo;bounces&rdquo; off in succession producing a purr with little or
no action in the voice box region.  That is why purring often sounds in
relation to breathing and why it feels like it comes from the chest rather
than the neck.</p>

<p>Some may believe that I am attributing too much intelligence or desire for
subversion to the cat species.  To these people I say, &ldquo;You have never
looked a cat in the face and seen their true nature.  Eyes are the windows
to the souls, and their eyes contain deviousness and deceit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course, all of this is merely a theory since generations of cats have
kept the secret.</p>

<p>p.s. In addition, I think Peter may be the whole key to figuring out how
cats purr.  Unfortunately, we can&rsquo;t bring this up to Wende because she would
be p&rsquo;o-ed if we dissected her cat.  Damn, the cats win again.
