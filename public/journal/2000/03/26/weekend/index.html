                        <p><title>Weekend</title>
<p class=date>10:37pm CST Monday 27 March 2000</p></p>

<p><p>This weekend was pretty full for both Wende and me.  Saturday
morning she worked 10am to 6pm.  During that time I played Ultimate in
the <a href="https://www.strayconesports.com">H.U.R.L.</a> tournament,
which we barely won by 1 point and I scraped up my knee pretty well.
After that, to work I went and wrote Valuation Statements for the
investment club.  Then investment club meeting at UH and then home for
a quick rest, then to Kroger for salad fixin&rsquo;s, and then Wende came
home and we both went to Maggie and John&rsquo;s house for big yummy Twin
Birthday celebration for Maggie and Molly!!!</p>

<p><p>Instead of purchasing cards for them, I drew them each one.
Maggie&rsquo;s said on the front, &ldquo;Ignore the message inside this card.&rdquo; On
the inside it said &ldquo;Ignore the message on the front of this card.&rdquo;  On
the back it said, &ldquo;HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!&rdquo;  and &ldquo;pay attention to this
message.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Molly&rsquo;s had, &ldquo;Hurry!  Open this card!&rdquo; on the front, and
&ldquo;Hurry!  Close this card!&rdquo; on the inside.  On the back it said,
&ldquo;Hurry! Paste this in your scrapbook!&rdquo; along with &ldquo;HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Then we came across a great idea and even drew them different cards
as well.  Basically, &ldquo;Dear Maggie: We designed a birthday celebration
just for you!  Happy Burp-Day!!!&rdquo;  For Molly it was &ldquo;Happy Bite-Day!!&rdquo;
Very appropriate for the silly lovely twins.</p>

<p><p>Somewhere during the evening, Meredith gave me a verbal
gift/blessing.  Basically that she saw my relationship with Wende as
super great and that she was excited and proud of me for settling
down.  I greatly appreciated her insight and truth.</p>

<p><p>It was super late when Wende and I went home.</p>

<p><p>- - - - - - -</p>

<p><p>On Sunday, Wende chose to skip church, and we instead visited the
beach!  She and I had not been to the beach in such a long time.  We
had never been alone.</p>

<p><p>The loveliest part of the day was watching Wende fly the kite that
Meredith and Eric gave me.  (OH!!  Meredith and Eric also gave me a
kite yesterday (Saturday)!!)  Wende said that she doesn&rsquo;t remember
ever having flown a kite as a kid or ever!  She was so <em>cute</em>
like a little kid with a new toy..  Frolicking and danicing with her
new pet kite.  I felt so in love with her.  I&rsquo;m so in love with
Wende!!</p>

<p><p>After the kite entertainment, we lay down on towels.
Unfortunately, lovely Wende has a lovely pink sunburn on her feet,
legs and chest.  This actually reminds me of when I first met her; she
had a sunburn and I got to rub aloe vera on her back.</p>

<p><p>We drove 80 miles from Galveston to Maggie and John&rsquo;s again on
Sunday.  This time to help them move their pool table.  That sucker is
heavy!!!  We took it apart at their storage unit, carried it a piece
at a time to John&rsquo;s and Will&rsquo;s trucks, then a piece at a time up the
stairs at their house.  We put the slates back onto the table surface,
but they&rsquo;ll have to hire someone else to level them.</p>

<p><p>That&rsquo;s my short written version of my great weekend!!</p>
