                        <p class=date>2:22pm Tuesday <b>29 February 2000</b></p>

<p class=note>(transcribed from my diary)</p>

<p><p>This morning, laying snuggly in bed with Wende, I asked her to marry me.
 Actually I sang a cute little made up song (as I often do in the morning
for her)</p>

<p><p><pre>
Wende Wende I love you
I want you to say &lsquo;I do&rsquo;
Wende Wende you&rsquo;re the best
ten eschelons above the rest!
</pre></p>

<p><p>Few weeks ago I had jokingly said, &ldquo;Wende, marry me!&rdquo; after she had said
something cute or brought me Taco Bell or something.  She asked me, &ldquo;are
you serious?&rdquo;  At that point I was not serious.  I said, &ldquo;if I ever really
ask you to marry me, you&rsquo;ll know it&rsquo;s for real.&rdquo;
<br>At that moment I had visions of limos, flowers, studded diamond ring,
hotel, jaccuzzi, balloons &ndash; everything.</p>

<p><p>But this morning the song just arrived.</p>

<p><p>Last night I-Group was great and afterward I called Wende.  She agreed
with my hunger and asked for Taco Bell at my house.  I bought it, and as I
was pulling into the driveway with 2 tostadas, chicken chalupa, dr pepper,
and nachos with no meat, no onions and extra beans, I thought, &ldquo;if she is
here already, I&rsquo;m going to ask her to marry me.&rdquo;   She was there already.</p>

<p><p>And she came downstairs to help me carry all the goodies up and I just
felt so loved!</p>

<p><p>So in my head I was all, <em>ask her!</em>.  So I said, &ldquo;Wende, um, how
was your day?&rdquo;
<br><em>try again.</em>
<br>&ldquo;Wende, I just want to say, um, that I love you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I had visions of a movie scene with Michael Keaton as Batman trying to
tell Vicki Vale who he is.  I was flat scared to ask her.</p>

<p><p>In the large overview of our relationship, I think the big switch from
&ldquo;no plans to marry&rdquo; to &ldquo;you are the bestest greatest thing in the planet&rdquo;
happened when she experienced the Woman Within weekend.  (That&rsquo;s the
women&rsquo;s version of New Warrior, of which I am a part)</p>

<p><p>After that our communication and trust and love just flourished miles
above what it had been before.  So incredibly awesome.</p>

<p><p>I finally did not ask her last night, but told her, &ldquo;I want to marry
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>This morning we were thinking about a date.  I said, &ldquo;Leap Year 2004!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>She was all, &ldquo;nah - too close to our birthdays.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I was all, &ldquo;what about just celebrating our days old days instead of
birthdays?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I like celebrating my birthday.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>So we settled on probably my favorite day of the year, summer solstice.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;When is that?&rdquo; she asks.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;June 21st, same as always.  Everyone knows that.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yeah, summer solstice!&rdquo; she patronized, &ldquo;I knew that.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>We had already agreed that my mom will do the ceremony, and I asked if
we can do it out by a lake.  As long as we go out of the country for our
honeymoon.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Disneyworld in Florida is a different country!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>We talked about Australia or Costa Rica as possibilities.</p>
