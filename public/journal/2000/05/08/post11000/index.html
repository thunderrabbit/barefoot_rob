<p class=note>(transcribed from

<p><p>My weekend was super excellent!  I celebrated my 11,000th day on Saturday.</p>

<p><p>Ultimate frisbee tournament in the morning (we won (no, the other team did not let us win because it was my special day)).  The field was drenched, nay soaked, nay great puddles of standing water after our rains.  There was plenty of grass, so it wasn&rsquo;t ridiculously muddy everywhere, although  muddy enough for a good team muddy picture after the game. (not scanned yet)</p>

<p><p>I got a couple of injuries, including mud jammed up my big toenail and kinda lifted it, and a cut on my big toe cuticle (same toe), and a minor skinned knee. (I play barefoot)  Oh, and a couple of splinters in my feet.  I only felt two splinters, which Wende removed Saturday evening, along with 12 other splinters which I did not feel.</p>

<p><p>After ultimate, the official celebration of my 11,000th day began.  I met at UH my friends Maggie and Molly (twins) and their respective husbands John and Will.  (We were all best buds in college at UH; we are even closer now)  We played a round of disc golf on the time honored course that has been played on campus for years.  Such super great fun.  The course basically makes a huge circuit around campus&hellip;  a disc golf campus tour.</p>

<p><p>We had a good spread of scores.  Will had 70, me 74, John 94, Molly 105, and Maggie 115.  (Disc golf is like golf golf, but we use frisbees instead of golf balls and statues, etc instead of golf holes.)</p>

<p><p>After golf, we hung out at my house for a bit to shower before watching GLADIATOR.  The movie was gory and bloody and  good story, with emotional highs and lows (mostly lows).  Good surround sound too.  Phil joined us for the movie and sat beside me.  He shared his Reeses Pieces and we made jokes at various things on screen (mostly not during the movie, but in the ads beforehand and at people&rsquo;s names in the credits).   Maggie sat on the other beside me, and filled me in on a scene which was just too brutal for me at the moment and I did not watch.</p>

<p><p>Um, then Oh!!  Star Pizza, the best best pizza in Houston (I won&rsquo;t go head to head against Chicago, but definitely the best in Houston and probably Texas).  Olivia was our waitress, whom we called by name a lot and were either very bothersome to her or very friendly&hellip;.  Mostly Molly dominated the conversation, answering our questions about Rome (she was a history major).  All very fascinating stuff.</p>

<p><p>After pizza, across the street to Amy&rsquo;s Ice Creams, where a cute girl server was wearing a little bonnet with cow ears and a cow bell.  I usually get Double Vanilla with M&amp;Ms mixed in.. but this day they had Vanilla Oatmeal Raisin Cookie flavor ice cream, in which I had them mix M&amp;M&rsquo;s.</p>

<p><p>Totally gorged on pizza and sugar, we all trooped back to my house where they dropped me off after hugs and 2 presents: a cool watch that hangs from my belt loop (very fashionable I&rsquo;m sure) and a set of microwaveable plastic bowls with a little vent on the top of the bowls to let steam out.</p>

<p><p>such a great 11,000th day!!!!</p>
