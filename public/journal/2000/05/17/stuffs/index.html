<p class=date>11:11pm CDT Wednesday 17 May 2000</p>
<p class=note>(My 11011th day)</p></p>

<p><p>Work was cool; with help from Kevin I finally am one tiny bit away
from finishing the coding I&rsquo;ve been working on for 3 days. I just need
to do final testing tomorrow.</p>

<p><p>Also tomorrow, we&rsquo;re going to interview a guy (Duane) to hopefully
take over as network administrator.  I was originally hired into the
position, but I have found that I enjoy programming more.</p>

<p><p>At the end of work, I switched two CD Rom drives - removed from
Karla&rsquo;s machine the one that is a CD writer, and replaced it with just
a normal CD Rom.  Put the CDW into a different machine.  Karla didn&rsquo;t
want to be kicked off her machine each time someone needs to burn a
CD.</p>

<p><p>- -</p>

<p><p>After work, I said HI to youth at Diedrich&rsquo;s Coffee - it was the
reincarnation of Wednesday Night Dinners, spearheaded by Ryan.  Props
to him for getting a great turnout!</p>

<p><p>I didn&rsquo;t stay long; I was s&rsquo;posed to meet Wende at home at 7:00pm.
I didn&rsquo;t even leave work until 6:39pm.</p>

<p><p>As I was leaving, I saw a familiar face from UH&hellip;  <em>What&rsquo;s her
name????</em> I strained my brain for a moment, but couldn&rsquo;t think of
it.  I walked up, and she recognized me as I said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember
your name&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>(Maggie and Molly, guess who it was!)</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Diana&rdquo;  (ha ha too late)</p>

<p><p>Big hug to her and we talk talk talked for a bit&hellip; but speaking of
late I was so late for Wende by the time I left.</p>

<p><p>Upon arrival home, I cleared with Wende - told her I was late
because I chose to say HI to Diana who I hadn&rsquo;t seen in 5 years.</p>

<p><p>Wende said she wanted me to have called when I knew I&rsquo;d be late.</p>

<p><p>(The grand irony of being late and clearing with Wende is that part
of the conversation with Diane was how well Wende and I communicate
and clear up problems between us.  I am so thankful for me an&rsquo; Wende&rsquo;s
relationship - that we are able to truly communicate openly and
quickly and effectively!!)</p>

<p><p>- -</p>

<p><p>At dinner of pasta and salad (lovely, just lovely) and then off to
Wendesday night ultimate.</p>

<p><p>I got to the field at 8-something and played only like 1.5 hours.
Super fun, and I had 1 great almost catch, and then several pretty
good catches and throws.</p>

<p><p>Good night!!</p>
