                        <p><p class=date>8:49am Thursday 10 August 2000</p>

<p><p>Robin and I did freestyle beatbox before the anti-racisim training.  We
may perform and have Blue and/or Justin do freestyle vocals or dance.</p>

<p><p>Watched a scene of Star Trek about the Borg and assimilation</p>

<p><p>Here&rsquo;s an energy break song:</p>

<p><p>Front to front to front my baby
<br>Back to back to back my baby
<br>side to side to side my baby
<br>this is how we do it</p>

<p><p>Come along and ride that pony
<br>Come along and ride that pony
<br>Come along and ride that pony
<br>This is how we do it</p>

<p><p><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of people inside the circle and ride the pony during &ldquo;come along and
ride&rdquo;  then face someone and dance according to front to front back to back
side to side part and then switch with the person</p>

<p><p class=date>11:33am</p>

<p><p>Blue describing the pain she felt when people called her &ldquo;flat face&rdquo; and
laughed at her eyes.  I can hear the pain in her story; I judge she still
has internalized sadness and pain.</p>

<p><p>Jennifer expressing how she got &ldquo;flat face&rdquo; comments, but felt more pain
about her glasses; she didn&rsquo;t feel pretty if she wore her glasses.  That&rsquo;s
exactly the same as me.</p>

<p><p>Leno is 15 and apparently not familiar with YRUU culture(?)  He introed a
song by Rage Against The Machine and was essentially warning us that it
would be loud and have some bad words in it.  So cute!!</p>

<p><p class=date>13:09</p>

<p><p>Joey and Jesse are guest speaking representatives from the Young Adult
organization, <a href="https://www.uuyan.org">www.uuyan.org</a>.</p>

<p><p class=date>13:21</p>

<p><p>Now we are collecting and organizing the brainstorms people had for the
next 5 years of YRUU</p>

<p><p class=date>14:06</p>

<p><p>Our little group is going to write a resolution for a 5 year plan to
deepen the YRUU and  UU faith</p>

<p><p class=date>14:18</p>

<p><p>Each of the three groups presented ideas; hopefully we will get three big
resolutions passed this year.</p>

<p><p class=date>14:50</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;re on the bus to zip off to the Super Secret Super Activity!!  I&rsquo;m
beside Matt, who knows what it is, but won&rsquo;t tell me.   We&rsquo;ve been asked to
bring warm clothing, flashlights, sunscreen, money&hellip;   Some of these items
I know are bogus ideas to throw us off&hellip;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;They are bogus; it&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; says Matt, &ldquo;except for the warm clothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>He&rsquo;s wearing pants and has a long sleeve shirt.</p>

<p><p>Zach, the bus driver addressed us: &ldquo;My name is Zach, and this is my bus.
I take care of it.  All I ask of you is that you keep it clean.  So if you
have any drinks or anything, please take care not to spill.  We&rsquo;re all going
to have a great time&hellip; if only someone would tell me where we are going.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>14:58</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;re slaughtering a version of Madonna&rsquo;s &ldquo;Like a Prayer&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>14:59</p>

<p><p>Just got a trucker to honk for us.</p>

<p><p class=date>15:02</p>

<p><p>truck two honked for us!</p>

<p><p>Here&rsquo;s the lyrics of a game chant thing:</p>

<p><p>Concentration
<br>fifty-four
<br>no repeats
<br>no hesitations
<br>category
<br>________
<br>Okay
<br>I&rsquo;ll start</p>

<p><p>And the idea is that each person in the circle has to name something from
the category when it&rsquo;s their turn.  May not repeat what anyone else has
said.</p>

<p><p class=date>10/8/00 15:39</p>

<p><p>En route to Super Secret, Jeff just said at the Bristol Speedway we are
not allowed to touch the cars.</p>

<p><p>Matt Just said there will be a concentration of oxygen.</p>

<p><p>I think we are going to a cave; we are in Tennessee.</p>

<p><p class=date>15:41</p>

<p><p>Zach just pointed out Vince Gill&rsquo;s house.  I think I took a picture of
the right one.  Now the youth are slaughtering a Vince Gill song I&rsquo;m
guessing.</p>

<p><p class=date>15:44</p>

<p><p>Nathan, unimpressed with seeing Vince Gill&rsquo;s house, sarcastically yelling
out the window, &ldquo;hey horse!  I just saw Vince Gill&rsquo;s house!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>15:45</p>

<p><p>We have arrived.  I was right: &ldquo;Welcome to appalachian Caverns&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>17:09</p>

<p><p>The cave was pretty fly.  Saw a few bats and went down a couple hundred
feet.  Fun formations but the cave is not super amazing since it was just
uncovered in 1988 or so - the entrance had been filled with 162 thousand
pounds of trash.</p>

<p><p>Coolest thing is there&rsquo;s a river at the bottom that is fed by 2 springs
and a lake apparently.</p>

<p><p>The coolest thing about the tour: We sang like monks in a darkened cavern
with beautiful melodious angelic echoes.  so peaceful and so beautiful.  We
are great!</p>

<p><p>here&rsquo;s Blue:</p>

<p><p class=message>that trip was awesome. it brings me back to the carlsbad
caverns that i visted last summer. we got to see the stalagtites and mites
when they were just pearls there. i love worship. i got to sing alot. and i
love singing. this is my second con. and i really love the community. it&rsquo;s
weird to think that things will end soon. and i never knew anyone else to
know so mucha bout things that i am passionate about. like the punk rock
academy song, s.o.a. , and social action&rsquo;s importance. it makes me feel
loved which i don&rsquo;t feel much at home. here. is wonderful, people really
care, they see people for their inner beauty,a nd as forme, my own true
childishness, innocence, and love for people. i haven&rsquo;t seen so many genuine
smiles, in a long time, i would love to live a life with this true wacky
happiness for the rest of my life. uuism fills these people with something i
have never found in anyother group i have ever met, it is the spirit of love
and happiness and freeness that generates through all of us. it is something
i have never felt so strongly, only at cons and with these people have i
ever felt this way. as for anti racist education, i am glad that i realized
so much about racism here, and not any where else. because people care
genuinly care here. and i am not afraid to smile, care, be open, and love
other people. i feel that this is what will give me emotional strength to
help me through school. this con has really let me see how much i can be
appreciated and loved, and how i should appreciate myself, and love myself,
for all of my good and bad qualities. Thank you every one for giving me this
experience, i will never be the same again&hellip; gratias, tanks, and thanks&hellip;</p>

<p><p class=date>18:27</p>

<p><p>Part 2 of  the Super Secret activity visting a art sale thing with booths
and booths and food and crafts and all kinds of fun stuff.  We at sandwiches
and cookes and walked around not too far; the booths were pretty much all
closing.  and it&rsquo;s only 6:30 local time.  In Houston the show would have
just been getting started!</p>

<p><p>Now we&rsquo;re driving to maybe a part 3 of SSA, but I don&rsquo;t know for certain;
it&rsquo;s a secret!</p>

<p><p>Zach is driving with the door open to get some air circulation.  Cool</p>

<p><p class=date>19:00</p>

<p><p>Wow.</p>

<p><p>The third part of the Super Secret:  watching the band perform!</p>

<p><p>I wanted to watch their parents&rsquo; night, so happy that we get to see it!</p>

<p><p>I learned the name of Angie, who I had met in the cafeteria; she&rsquo;s on the
staff of this bandcamp.</p>

<p><p class=date>19:31</p>

<p><p>I just beat Laura at Concentration 54 in the category &ldquo;Types of Music&rdquo;
with &ldquo;Chickenskin&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>The band was fly, and performed jazzy versions of &ldquo;Home on the Range&rdquo;,
something else, and something from The Color Purple.</p>

<p><p class=date>19:45</p>

<p><p>Maia says:</p>

<p><p class=messages>SO then I was all impressed that at my next rally, which
was Austin 96, that Jeremy remembered me.  So basically I hung out with him
and Katy perkins and Curtis.  That&rsquo;s the first time I remember you from.
That was a cool rally.  We all went to Barton Springs and it was all kinds
of boss.  After that, I didn&rsquo;t go to another rally until Houston 97 (Bif!)
and then I didn&rsquo;t miss another rally for like 2 and a half years.  Yeah my
rally history.</p>

<p><p class=date>2:38am Friday 11 august 2000</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;ve been up writing resolutions and project proposals.  I wrote a short
project proposal to create some electronic resources (templates) to make it
easier to write resolutions and project proposals.</p>

<p><p>Turns out that I&rsquo;m not allowed to sponsor the proposal myself, so Ann is
the point contact, and I&rsquo;m her Primary Aid, and I do all the work.</p>

<p><p>At about midnight, we had worship, which started with consumption
(inhalation) of 4 large pizzas.  Then we sat in a circle and described
ou(*)r first crush or our first kiss.  Then Unconditional Love to complete
the worship.</p>

<p><p>Above at the (*) is the moment where my Visor gave me a warning of low
batteries.  I quickly popped the new ones in, retained all my information,
and have full batteries!</p>

<p><p>So now it&rsquo;s about 2:43am; I&rsquo;m going to shower and then sleep!</p>
