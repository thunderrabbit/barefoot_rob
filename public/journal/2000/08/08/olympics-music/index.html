                        <p><p class=date>7:12am Tuesday 8 August 2000</p>

<p><p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>Dreamt that Steve asked me about the history of why we have
codeans for SWUUSI and the history of that. I was all, well let&rsquo;s ask some
of the older youth and see - youth like Shawn T (1998)  Deborah  D (1989)
Jenny K (1987)</p>

<p><p>In parenthesis are graduation dates approx</p>

<p><p class=dream>I suddenly found myself crying cause I hadn&rsquo;t seen Deborah in
so long.  Then I woke up just before the wake up crew came in to sing
quietly to us.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m  curious about that emotional response - I don&rsquo;t feel all tearful
about it now that I am awake; I wonder if that sadness is actually buried in
me (and would like to come out), or if it&rsquo;s apparent sadness that represents
something else..</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p class=date>7:57</p>

<p><p>At breakfast, Micaela described to me her conversation with Fricke when
he first became vegan.  He didn&rsquo;t know what he could eat.
<br>Micaela: &ldquo;No, that has lard in it.&rdquo;
<br>Jason: &ldquo;Oh, and I can&rsquo;t eat that?&rdquo;
<br>&ldquo;No, you can&rsquo;t&rdquo;
<br>&ldquo;Dammit!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=date>8:34</p>

<p><p>Slowly trickling into our seats for the racial awarensss workshop.</p>

<p><p>We played hacky sack and I was pretty impressed with how well I did!  I
got a few kicks using the back of my calf and bottom of my foot.</p>

<p><p class=message>this is so amazing. so so so (!!!) amazing.  I&rsquo;m just
impressed with this tiny kegboard adn tiny screen.  it&rsquo;s beyond amazing.  hi
helen this is so cool !!!</p>

<p><p class=date>11:18</p>

<p><p>Did a lot of visioning what we want our anti-racist organization to
ultimately embody.   The group is doing great work.</p>

<p><p class=date>12:18</p>

<p><p>Lunch was lovely; I had a lot of lettuce (with a slice of pizza under
it), some pineapple (with chocolate pudding under it) and some granola
cereal (with lucky charms under it)</p>

<p><p>I absentmindedly dipped my pizza in pudding and the group was grossed
out.  I told them I had only found 2 combinations of food that I would eat
separately but tasted really badly together:  Surge and blueberry ice cream
float, and orange juice and rootbeer mix.  Ick.</p>

<p><p>At 12:30 we have plenary (10 minutes or so)</p>

<p><p class=date>15:15</p>

<p><p>We had Puddy Olympics to begin Plenary.  2nd year YCers have been matched
up with a first year YCer and the relationship is called Puddy short for
Plenary Buddy.</p>

<p><p>Olymiad required not using our hands, and using a spoon to pick up little
colored eggs with Silly Putty in them.  Then without dropping the eggs,
carrying them back to the starting line.</p>

<p><p>Back inside, we accepted our moderator Alison and then we got an
introduction to the Formal Consensus Process.</p>

<p><p>Then during break we just tossed the frisbee around some.   Now break is
over and we&rsquo;re going to practice consensus on a mock resolution.</p>

<p><p>Sonja, my Puddy, and I are making little putty shapes and stuff.
Interestingly, she made a graduation-of-color-line this year just like I did
last year.</p>

<p><p class=date>16:19</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m glad we did the mock resolution; I didn&rsquo;t realize how confusing it
could be within the discussion, keeping track of where we are in the
Consensus Process.</p>

<p><p class=date>17:00</p>

<p><p>Various leaders are describing resources and the state of the budget and
stuff.   Dinner soon.</p>

<p><p>I think I am going to describe a resource - the adults&hellip; I have nothing
prepared, but it&rsquo;s okay.  People want to go eat soon.</p>

<p><p class=date>19:20</p>

<p><p>After dinner, which was really yummy, we had a 30 minute break during
which we tossed the disk around a bit.</p>

<p><p>Back inside, Blue played an amazing beautiful piano thing that I
recognized as Tori Amos, but I hadn&rsquo;t heard the particular song before.
Turns out it was not Tori Amos composed, but Blue wrote the riffs
<em>herself</em> and just tied them all together and made up lyrics.</p>

<p><p>So so incredible!!!  Easily the quality of Tori Amos.  Amazing.</p>

<p><p>Now touchgroup is trading embarassing (and funny) stories.</p>

<p><p class=date>20:29</p>

<p><p>I read an article/story written about Silent Football by Bryn.  She
described her history of SF games, starting with her first, where Danny K
received  the football, looked startled, and ran off with it.  So funny!  We
were in a corner hallway of OKC church at a rally and it was so funny!!!</p>

<p><p>I cried after reading her story.  Bryn is in Australia for a year,
starting just a few days ago.  I look forward to hearing her stories and
playing more silent football with her.</p>

<p><p>Then rumors of swimming (I&rsquo;m back here at YC) so we went to the pool but
they said no swimming because it lightning outside.  Indoor pool&hellip;??</p>

<p><p>Now we&rsquo;re inside singing &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve Lost That Lovin&rsquo; Feeling&rdquo; and Steve is
playing guitar and I don&rsquo;t know this song, but that&rsquo;s okay.</p>

<p><p>Now we&rsquo;re singing</p>

<p><p><ol>
<li>&ldquo;Rocky Racoon&rdquo;
<li>&ldquo;Yellow Submarine&rdquo;
<li>&ldquo;Working Overtime&rdquo; by BTO
<li>&ldquo;Standing on the ground&rdquo; (?)
<li>&ldquo;American Pie&rdquo;
<li> &ldquo;Faith&rdquo;  by George Michael
<li>&ldquo;The Boxer&rdquo; (the bridge only)
<li>&ldquo;I wanna hold your hand&rdquo;
<li>&lsquo;there was a worm stuck in my straw&rsquo;  (acapella by Alison)
<li>&ldquo;Let it be&rdquo;
<li>&ldquo;Imagine&rdquo;  (as soap bubbles floated over the circle)
<li>&ldquo;Kinghts in White Satin&rdquo;
</ol></p>

<p><p class=date>21:21</p>

<p><p>I left the singing circle.</p>

<p><p class=date>22:04</p>

<p><p>meeting now for Identity Groups (30 minutes late)</p>

<p><p class=date>23:19</p>

<p><p>Group was cool and then we rejoined as a big groupup again and bonded
well.  Paris is so funny.  I love him!</p>

<p><p class=date>0:05</p>

<p><p>Worship was nice; love and hugs all around.  I walked back to our dorm
with Laura D; we talked about art she has created and I told her about the
marble track I built.</p>

<p><p>Sleep soon.</p>
