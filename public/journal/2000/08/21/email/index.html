Dear Rob,

Thank you for using the Priceline for Gasoline
service.  Our records indicate that you visited
River Oaks Exxon, Houston on 7/28/00 8:28:00 PM
and pumped 21.2 of Regular Unleaded at a pump price
of $1.53 per gallon.  As a result you over pumped
your prepaid gasoline purchase by 1.2 gallons. Our
policy is to honor your prepaid price of $1.41 per
gallon (or the pump price if it is lower) for up to 5
additional gallons. We have charged your credit
or check card on file with us $1.69 for these
additional 1.2 gallons of gasoline.

If there is a difference between your station
receipt and our records shown above, simply reply
to this e-mail and include the information printed
on your receipt. For your full account history,

HI

I think there is a flaw in your logic:

If I am allowed 5 gallons over my requested amount
(which was 20 gallons), then I may pump up to 25
gallons.

I pumped 21.2 gallons, which is not more than 25
gallons.

Please do not charge me extra for the 1.2 gallons.

    Thanks!
    - Rob

Hello,

I think your auto-reply did not read my email.

I did NOT pump more than 5 gallons over.

Please have a human read the original message you
sent me!

21.2 gallons is LESS THAN 25 gallons.

Please do not charge me extra for 1.2 gallons.

Please have a lovely day.

    - Rob

Dear Rob:

Thank you for your recent e-mail.

When you go to the station to pump your prepaid
gasoline, you may pump as much as you need, as
long as you do not exceed the total number of
gallons on your Prepaid Gas List.

Please note that if you over pump by less than 5
gallons, we will charge your credit card your
prepaid price. As you had overpumped 1.2 gallons
we have charged you with your prepaid price of $1.41
which amounts to $1.69.

Thank you for inquiring about Priceline for Gasoline.

George-

In the original message sent by you guys, it stated
that we pumped 21.2 gallons.

21.2 gallons is not more than 5 gallons over 20
gallons.

Please for goodness sakes admit that.  Just please
admit that 21.2 gallons is not more than 25 gallons.

Then please explain why your computer believes we
pumped 5 gallons over.

Dear Mr. Nugen:

Thank you for your e-mail.

We apologize for the confusion regarding overpumping. Our records
indicate that you have over pumped 1.2 gallons and since it falls below
the 5 gallon overpump limit we have charged your credit card for 1.2
gallons at your prepaid price ($1.41 per gallon) for each gallon
overpumped.

To make it more clear, please note that if you over pump by 5 gallons or
less, we will charge your credit card your prepaid price for each gallon
overpumped. If you over pump by more than 5 gallons, we will charge your
credit card the retail pump price for each gallon overpumped.

Please check the status of your account 24 hours a day on our Web site
at https://www.priceline.com . Simply click "My Profile" and "Your
Account History" to view account details.

Thank you for inquiring about Priceline for Gasoline. We look forward to
helping you save money on gasoline!
