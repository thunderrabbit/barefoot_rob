<p class=date>3:52am CDT Saturday 19 August 2000</p>
<p class=note>(dream)</p></p>

<p><p>anti racist workshop inspired</p>

<p><p class=dream>YRUU, we were in a house, and about to get on a bus to
go somewhere.  We were in a meeting and (Bitter Bitter) Kate walked
in, but she was like older and coming back from having been in YRUU a
couple of years ago.  I didn&rsquo;t recognizer her..  had heard her name
but not seen her.  It was late at night for this group of youth; we
were all talking..  kinda upstairs in a loft room thing and we heard
someone come in and it was Jen and she had brought Kate with her.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Then it was time for the group to leave so we were all
hopping into my van/bus thing but someone had left their sandals in my
dorm room, so I yelled down out the window at them who&rsquo;s shoes were
these and did they want me to bring them?  &ldquo;They&rsquo;re mine&rdquo; and yes,
from Jen and someone else.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Then we were on the bus and we were talking to a man
with dark skin from a country in Paraguay who was running to be
president of the US.  He described how he had little chance to become
president, but that the tide was slowly turning.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Scene shifted to like a parking lot with chairs all
around the perimeter.  A white man who was dressed in layers of ripped
up clothing was barely able to speak english asked me for some money.</p>

<p><p class=dream>The guy from Paraguay had lots of food and supplies -
he was backpacking across he US</p>

<p><p class=dream>I started cooking some eggs and forgot about them and
began talking to a man who appeard to be from the middle east.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I walked over to him and was all, motioning something
like, &ldquo;are you hungry?&rdquo; and then &ldquo;do you speak English?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>He said in perfect non accented English, &ldquo;yes, I am
teaching my kids German, old German, English, Hindi. He had two
infants with him - well toddlers, but they were in basket things and I
held out my hand to &ldquo;give me five&rdquo; and the one kid taught the other
how to do it by giving me five.  He was all, &ldquo;watch&rdquo; and slapped my
hand, and the other child did a sloppy job of it.  &ldquo;okay, turn your
hand over&rdquo; and then I brushed my hand to give him five.  He was a
baby; I didn&rsquo;t want to slap his hand.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Then their dad was all, &lsquo;what is this give me five?&rdquo;
and I taught him how to do it.  He did a bad job and missed my hand,
but hit my wrist the first time.  He showed me his country&rsquo;s custom of
kissing back of hand.  His skin was very dark and I kissed the back of
his hand.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Then my dad called me over, &ldquo;Rob need your help&rdquo; and I
was all, &ldquo;excuse me&rdquo; to the guy, and oops the eggs were pretty burnt.
Mimi was over near them and I was chanting some Beastie Boys lyrics as
I tried to salvage the eggs.  They weren&rsquo;t totally burned, but the
plastic spatulaa I had used was melted on the edge of the skillet.  I
threw it in the trash, and it seared a hole in the trash bag as it
fell into the garbage can.</p>
