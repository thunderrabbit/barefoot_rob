<p class="dream">Driving Mr Van with some friends, including Natalie
from PB, I learned that one of my friends was able to start Mr Van
with a lockpick key that worked very easily.  He wanted to drive, but
because he wasn't on our insurance, I said it was illegal and asked
him not to.</p>

<p class="dream">He distracted me with a puzzle and then when I looked
up, I disocvered he was driving the van! I was pissed!  I was like
"Stop the Van Right Now How The Fuck you think you can drive the Van
after I TOLD you very Clearly Not to!" and then was a bit more sane
and let him speak, but I assured him I had mentioned insurance and it
being illegal.</p>

<p class="dream">Other people in our group felt unsafe as a result of
my outburst, so I invited each person to clear with me whatever they
were feeling.  One of the women said she wanted to speak, but then
sent her daughter with a lawn sprinkler to spray water on people,
including me.</p>

<p class="dream">I went back into the van when the girl started
spraying some old man who was not even part of our group.  "Uh yeah so
I heard you wanted to say something, but I just got sprayed with
water; was there anything specific you wanted to say?"</p>

<p class="dream">No one else wanted to say anything, so I just ate
some grapes or whatever was at the table where they were eating buffet
style.  Then Kim Sawyer was there and I planned to tell him I had lost
it at a guy to get his input, but then Lin woke me up.</p>
