<ol>
<li>I completed 40 frames of animation yesterday with new camera and
trial version of DragonFrame.  I think I will buy a license for
it.  One big question at this point is how to handle N*10^6 images
in the final project.</li>
<li>I am currently headed to SOGO (Suns Out Guns Out) an exercise group
I joined late last year, like in September I guess.  I only go on
Sundays, but there are other activities people do every day of the
week.  I am most interested in rock climbing, but I teach Sarumama
on Mondays when the rock climbing group meets.</li>
<li>I started messing around with Mailchimp again to set up reminders
before meetings, but have not completed it yet.. They do not have a
way to send out mails every 1st and 3rd Tuesday, which is what I
want.  I got messages to send via their API, but have not connected
it to cron yet on my server.  So close; why did I not finish?  I am
an expert at not finishing projects.</li>
<li>I plan to meet Tariq today after SOGO.  We want to upgrade our iOS
apps to latest and &ldquo;greatest&rdquo; version of iOS and XCode, the
steaming pile of okay well I have not used XCode 9 yet, but I
assume it will be just as annoying as always.</li>
<li>Interesting to think about how I like to take pictures of
construction over time, I am doing a stop action animation project,
and I am planning to write (in reverse) a
<del>book</del><ins>story</ins> within commit messages of these
journal entries.  This is the first time I have mentioned it in the
content of my journal and not the commit messages.  All of these
seem like stop motion animation to me. I must be fascinated with
changes over time or something.</li>
<li>Lin wants to buy a new mattress and to clean my room.  Cleaning my
room took priority over the mattress, so I am curious as to how
much she really wants a new mattress.  It&rsquo;s my fucking room; forget
about it.</li>
<li>We have been calling my mom every week. I should call Dad too.
Shit it is fathers day this Sunday I think.  That is today here and
tomorrow there.</li>
<li>The co-gender circle has had 3 meetings; we are going through
Kauth&rsquo;s book <em>A Circle of Men</em>.  There may be some new men joining
the men&rsquo;s circle soon.</li>
<li>I bought domain name mypowercircle.org and authenticcircles.org but
have not done anything with them except redirect to
<a href="https://tokyo">https://tokyo</a>. in each case.</li>
<li>Abbrevs because arrived and gotta get off train.</li>
<li>Just switched trains in Yoyogi Uehara to the Chiyoda Line, on
which Helma used to live before she got kicked out of the
country for overstaying her visa.  #srsbzns</li>
<li>We have one cat (Jennie), zero kids, zero other animals, a lot of
plants, including a bit of a garden with herbs (Lin&rsquo;s hard work),
a subscription to milk delivery (just like old times except with
cartons instead of bottles) and occaional meal-ingredient
delivery.</li>
<li>I have recently bought a new laptop cooler for my 5 yo Macbook.</li>
<li>9:57am Just arrived in Meiji-Jingu-Mae/Harajuku so see ya after SOGO<br /></li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>I am downstairs in Wendes/First Kitchen in Shibuya, and Tariq will
arrive soon.  There are outlets available.  I am super low on cash
right now, but I had enough for a chicken burger, and I have
enough to get back home.</li>
