<p>I have not yet seen Kai&rsquo;s great presentation, but I have been assured
it was great!  Soness coached her, so I know she received
compassionate knowledgable wisdom from a speaking pro!</p>

<p>I arrived just as the last speaker finished; I found the room because
I heard the applause from outside the door.</p>

<p>Lukas invited me in for the final picture, so we stood together in the
back.  He actually knew me from having been on TV earlier this year!</p>

<p>I also met his friend Rikako, who asked me about being barefoot, and
we thereby me Kiyoka and Daniel, who said they were eavesdropping on
our conversation.  I told them the whole story about being barefoot in
Houston and then being shod here before realizing no one would mind if
I were to be barefoot here.  I talked about my Pecha Kucha
presentation from last year (and got confused on the dates, thinking
my TV appearance was this February, but it was actually <em>last</em>
February (or so).  Anyway, they seemed interested so I told them about
and invited them to men&rsquo;s circle and co-gender circle respectively.</p>

<p>Rikako and Lukas are hosting a gathering this Saturday (near me and
Lin&rsquo;s house!) so I will join them there.</p>

<p>I gave a testimonial for Soness&rsquo;s coaching; I can still remember the
experience of preparing and presenting for Pecha Kucha as if it were a
recent event.  Kai did a testimonial as well; we could see she was
carrying herself with more confidence than before.  Apparently her
co-workers have recognized this as well.  So proud of her!</p>
