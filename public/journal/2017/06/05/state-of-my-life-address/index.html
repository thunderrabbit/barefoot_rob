<ol>
<li>I met Caroline, who seems to be a soul I&rsquo;ve met in previous lifetime(s)</li>
<li>Two men might join Tokyo men&rsquo;s circle, which would put us up to 5 (cause it seems <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> men have stopped coming)</li>
<li>A woman is interested in joining Tokyo co-gender circle.  That will put us up to 7 if all 6 people come next time.</li>
<li>Tokyo Men&rsquo;s Circle meetings are on 1st and 3rd Tuesdays each month.</li>
<li>Tokyo Co-gender Circle meets on 2nd and 4th Tuesday each month.</li>
<li>I am the contact person for both</li>
<li>We have had two (2) co-gender group meetings so far.</li>
<li>The short term plan is to keep going and keep inviting new people into the circles</li>
<li>Medium term goal is to find enough people interested in learning how to do facilitation that it makes sense for us to have a facilitation trainer come in and teach for a weekend.</li>
<li>Long term goal is to have women leaders lead the co-gender circle as a women&rsquo;s circle</li>
<li>Vision is to reduce the number of suicides in Japan by giving people a safe place to talk about their feelings.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m on the local train now headed home from CB</li>
<li>We are planning to switch their servers over to new servers tomorrow.  Hopefully it will go smoothly.</li>
<li>I plan to do final testing tonight; I need to compare a buncha URIs on each server to make sure the content is exactly the same (JSON).</li>
<li>Yay(?)</li>
<li>Before the great server-swap, I plan to meet Caroline for a private session.  I have kinda been thinking of questions but have not written them down yet.</li>
<li>* How can I act more loving toward Lin?</li>
<li>* Am I on track with current diet or should I be even more careful than recently?</li>
<li>* What did you mean when you said I was healthy?</li>
<li>* How can I align my heart with income?</li>
<li>* how much time should I spend on Marble Track 3?</li>
<li>* What else are you inspired to tell me?</li>
<li>I am currently level 24 in Pokemon Go.  I plan to get to Level 25 so I can zoom through a bunch of Evolutions while I have a Special Egg or whatever.</li>
<li>I have not touched iOS apps with Tariq for a while; they are well overdue for updates.</li>
<li>I have been working on Marble Track 3 each Tuesday, though I probably will <em>not</em> work on it tomorrow.  I am making a choice to meet with Caroline and then do the server upgrade with CB, which will probably eat up all my time before I-group.  Boo hoo to a degree, but I really think I should have had the upgrades done by now, had shit not gone awry.</li>
<li>Oh, so anyway, MT3 so far has zero (0) photos taken for the stop animation portion.  But I did buy a nice camera..  ohhhh that is what I can do.  Between CB and Tokyo Men&rsquo;s Circle tomorrow, I plan to go buy a tripod for the camera.</li>
<li>I bought mypowercircle.org and authenticcircles.org about 10 days ago, but have not put anything on them.  I will probably end up using tokyo.mypowercircle.org and let the other domain go bye-bye.  Thanks to Paola for (correctly) suggesting that a real domain is better than a Facebook Group.  More legit, more exandable, more reassuring, more work, more fun.</li>
<li>I have been sort-kinda steady-state low-key studying Japanese, taking up to three (3) lessons per week.  but during server upgrade madness, I had not been doing homework. I did a teeny bit of homework before recent lesson with Fumiko.</li>
<li>庭にワニは鶏を食べた。Why has no one offered me this variant? I just made it up after hearing some other kids practice the conventional version.</li>
