<ol>
<li>As of last night, Lin and I plan to go to Peru, likely to The Way Inn, in 2018.</li>
<li>I am up early to head to work (teach) at IL.</li>
<li>I will soon have another lesson starting on Mondays, kinda within walking distance (1.5 hour walk)</li>
<li>I have to leave for work in 5 minutes, and am debating taking my computer to work on SoML. Okay I will take it because I think writing in my journal is an important artifact of my life.</li>
<li>The left hand ctrl key doesn&rsquo;t work on this USB keyboard. I am not sure why I haven&rsquo;t mapped it to caps lock, but I may do that.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve got semicolon mapped to backspace and apostrophe mapped to return.  This is so my right pinky doesn&rsquo;t have to move as far.  Awesomely enough, my middle finger was just now able to hit F8, which I have mapped to apostrophe. (and F9 to quote.  Let&rsquo;s see if I can hit it without looking {&ldquo;.  Pretty close.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s now 6:20am and I&rsquo;ve just sat down on the Romance Car, which will arrive in Shinjuku at 6:41am.</li>
<li>I had an idea for a new app game thing.  MVP: People place messages
with geo-coordinates.  The messages can only be read by people who
are sufficiently close to those coordinates.  Next, messages can be
password encrypted.  Next, messages can have a readable radius
attached to them.</li>
<li>I wonder when/if I/who will write the app.  I can start with a sample geo-tag photos app and then go from there.</li>
<li>I have not been working on AB as much as before.  I wonder if they are done with the project.</li>
<li>Noborito station now has rails again. This time they were welded together before being placed.</li>
<li>I am considering starting a new men&rsquo;s circle (on Saturdays?) to which I will invite the men from SOGO.  Gotta find a location first and see if most of them are good with Saturdays.  Actually, I should see if they are good for Saturdays first, and then see if any of them know a location.</li>
<li>Marble Track 3 now has about 2 minutes of video worth of exposures (at 12 frames per second).  At this point in the movie, the characters are approaching the spinning (flying) bearing with hooked poles so they can center it above the stage.  After that, the screws will be placed and the screwdriver will drive them into the stage.  After that, the helicopter will be turned to 11 so it can fly the stage itself.</li>
<li>I found a restaurant in Tokyo Tower where I can use an electric outlet.  When my Monday afternoon lessons start, I will probably chill there for a couple hours (and work) while waiting for the lesson.</li>
<li>Lin and I have Jennie (the cat named after Jennifer) who is now about 4 years old I think.</li>
<li>I haven&rsquo;t reached Dad since Houston flooded, but I am sure he&rsquo;s fine because no news is good news.</li>
<li>I am up to level 414 in Dots and Co.</li>
<li>I just heard the Welcome Back Kotter theme as muzak in a convenience store.</li>
<li>I just saw about 0.5 cubic meters of food being removed from that convenience store, in a garbage bag.</li>
<li>Why don&rsquo;t we have teleporters which can send food to places that it&rsquo;s needed?</li>
<li>I haven&rsquo;t talked to Fred in a bit.  I&rsquo;ll email him now.</li>
<li>From Fred: We were fine, got some rain and my car smelled like
mildew for a few days, and that was it. Dad was also fine. Katy&rsquo;s
house in Houston flooded, as you may have seen on FB, and they are in
an apartment for the next several months.  (by &ldquo;got some rain&rdquo; i mean
it was really fucking rainy, high winds and zero visibility when
passing 18-wheelers, and i had three inches of rain inside my car for
four days.)</li>
<li>AB said I did some work for them which was my idea and not their request.  I still haven&rsquo;t learned what work they mean.  (Upgrading Ubunutu server?)</li>
