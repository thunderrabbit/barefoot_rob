<p>The following are the Terms of Service for Transferwise.</p>

<p>There are a few weird translations I noticed:</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;transfer unnecessary&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;forwarding prohibited&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;electromagnetic&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;electronic&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>Users cannot use the service if their &ldquo;inheritance has commenced.&rdquo;
What does that mean?</p>

    </ol>

<h4>Article 8 (How to Use the Services)</h4>

    <li>The Remitter shall specify the remittance amount or the amount receivable and submit a remittance request to the Company by one of the following methods
        <ol>
            <li>Designation of amount receivable: The Remitter will specify the amount receivable in the local currency of the Payee, and the remittance amount in the local currency of the Remitter will be calculated based on such amount receivable.</li>
            <li>Designation of remittance amount: The Remitter will specify the remittance amount in the local currency of the Remitter, and the amount receivable in the local currency of the Payee will be calculated based on such remittance amount.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The Company will use its own set exchange rate when calculating the remittance amount or the amount receivable. The Company will take reasonable measures when setting its exchange rate to be synchronized with the mid-market rate on the global currency markets. However, the exchange rate set by the Company is based on various sources of information and the Company does not guarantee it will be synchronized with the mid-market rate at a specific point of time. The Company assumes no liability for any reduction to the amount receivable as a result of fluctuations in the currency exchange market.</li>
    <li>The Company does not take any margin or spread on the exchange rate from the perspective of clarifying the transaction fees, hence there are no buy and sell rates. The exchange rates offered to the Remitter and Payee are identical. The Remitter shall be entitled to set the minimum exchange rate to be used in the currency conversion; this allows the Remitter to manage against the risk of unexpected exchange rate fluctuations. A remittance request submitted by a Remitter will be converted based on the exchange rate(s) offered by the single trading partner or multiple trading partners selected by the Company at that time. In such case, the effective exchange rate ultimately applied to the remittance will be calculated from the weighted average of the exchange rates offered by all these trading partners of the Company.</li>
    <li>After submitting a remittance request, the Remitter shall transfer the remittance amount and transaction fees to the bank account designated by the Company. In the case of the method referred to in item (1) in section 1, the remittance amount shall be calculated from the minimum exchange rate set by the Remitter. The Company shall subsequently refund any difference between this remittance amount calculated from the minimum exchange rate set by the Remitter and the actual amount remitted to the payment option selected by the Remitter.</li>
    <li>The upper transaction limit for payments utilizing the Services is 1,000,000 yen (not including transaction fees) or the foreign currency equivalent thereof. The maximum amount to be received by the Payee in local currency varies in accordance with the exchange rate applied at the time of remittance processing by the Company. There is no lower limit.</li>
    <li>Remittances shall be processed by the Company after verification of the Remitter's identity under the preceding Article and the transfer of the necessary remittance amount and transaction fees by the Remitter under section 4. The amount transferred by the Remitter to the Company will be refunded to the payment option selected by the Remitter in the event the remittance request has been cancelled by the Remitter or refused by the Company. The Company may refuse a remittance request if the Remitter's registered name or address, etc. does not match the Remitter's payment details (e.g. bank account details). In this case, the Remitter shall pay a predetermined additional administration charge, and the Company may deduct such charge from the amount deposited by the Remitter</li>
</ol>

<h4>Article 9 (Use of the Services by Registered Users))</h4>
<ol>
    <li>The Remitters using the Services for the first time will be required to register for the Services if remitting an amount in excess of 100,000 yen. Said user registration procedures will be completed upon verification of the Remitter's identity through the Remitter's submission of the identity verification documents detailed in paragraph 1 of Article 6 to the Company and the sending of transfer unnecessary registered mail to the address or location of the Remitter, etc. Registered users will not be required to submit identity verification documents each time they subsequently make a remittance.</li>
    <li>The Users registering for the Services will specify a user ID and password. The Users shall strictly manage their user ID and password on their own responsibility to ensure their user ID and password are not known to any third party. The Company assumes no liability for any damage suffered by Users as a result of a third party coming to know the User's user ID and password.</li>
    <li>The term of the agreement for the Users registering for the Services shall be three (3) years. The agreement shall automatically be renewed for a further three (3) years provided the Users have not requested cancellation of the agreement during its term, and the same shall apply thereafter.</li>

    <li> 当社は、前二項に基づく情報他その他の情報を勘案し、その裁量において、利用者の利用登録または送金依頼を拒絶する権利を有するものとします。</li>
</ol>

<h4>第7条 (本サービスの内容)</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>当社は、本規約に従って、送金依頼人の送金依頼に基づき、送金依頼人が指定する送金受取人に対し指定する金額の海外送金を行います。送金依頼人が当社ウェブサイト上で送金依頼を行い、当社が送金依頼人から送金金額及び第１１条に定める利用手数料を受領したときは、当社と送金依頼人との間で送金委託契約が成立するものとします。</li>

            </ol>

<h4>第8条 (本サービスの利用方法)</h4>
<ol>
    <li> 送金依頼人は、以下のいずれかの方法により送金金額または受取金額を確定させ、当社に送金依頼を行うものとします。
        <ol>
            <li> 受取金額指定：送金受取人側の通貨における受取金額を確定させ、これを基に換算し、送金依頼人側の通貨における送金金額を算出する方法</li>
            <li> 送金金額指定：送金依頼人側の通貨における送金金額を確定させ、これを基に換算し、送金受取人側の通貨における受取金額を算出する方法</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li> 当社は、送金金額または受取金額を算出するにあたり、当社の定める為替レートを使用します。当社は、為替レートを定めるにあたって、世界的な為替市場における中値 (ミッドレート )と同期するような合理的措置を実施します。しかしながら、当社により定められた為替レートは各種情報源に依拠するものであり、必ずしも、特定のある時点における指標と一致することを保証するものではありません。当社は、為替市場における変化によって発生する受取金額の減少について、いかなる責任も負いません。</li>
    <li> 当社では、利用手数料透明化の観点より、外国為替におけるマージン、スプレッド等の中間差益を一切排除します。そのため、本サービス上では、売り・買いという概念がなく、送金依頼人と送金受取人に提示されている為替レートは常に同一となります。為替レートについて、送金依頼人は、換算に利用されるレートの下限設定を行うことができるものとします。これにより、送金依頼人は、想定外の為替変動によるリスクを管理することができます。送金依頼人が実行した送金依頼は、当社がその時点において選択する単独または複数の取引相手との間における、それぞれの為替レートにより換算されます。この場合においては、最終的に当該送金に適用される為替レートは、これらすべての取引相手との間に適用された為替レートの加重平均により算出されます。</li>
    <li> 送金依頼人は、送金依頼後、当社の決済銀行口座に送金金額および利用手数料を振り込むものとします。第１項第１号の方法を利用した場合の送金金額は、送金依頼人が設定した下限レートにより換算された送金金額となります。送金金額と実際に送金された金額との間に差額が発生した場合には、当社は、当該差額を送金依頼人の行った送金方法に従い返金するものとします。</li>
    <li> 本サービスによる送金可能上限額は1件あたり100万円 (利用手数料は含まれない)またはその同等額とします。受取人側の通貨における送金可能上限額は、当社が送金処理を行う時点の為替レートにより変動します。下限額は存在しません。</li>
    <li> 最終的な送金処理は、前条に基づく本人確認が終了し、前項に基づき送金依頼人より必要な金額が振り込まれた場合に実行されるものとします。当該送金依頼が取り消しされまたは当社により拒絶された場合には、振り込まれた金額は、送金依頼人の行った送金方法に従い返金されます。当社は、送金依頼人の登録名義または住所等が送金依頼人の行った送金方法の情報と一致しない場合には、送金依頼を拒絶することができるものとします。この場合、送金依頼人は所定の追加手数料を支払うものとし、当社は当該手数料を、送金依頼人からの振込金額から差し引くことができるものとします。</li>
</ol>

<h4>第9条 (利用者の義務)</h4>
<ol>
    <li> 本サービスを初めて利用される送金依頼人が、10万円を超える金額の送金依頼を行う場合には、必ず利用者登録が必要です。第６条第１項の本人確認書類を当社に提出し、送金依頼人の住所又は所在地に転送不要書留郵便が送付される等、本人確認がなされたことをもって、利用者登録が完了します。利用者登録完了後の送金については、都度、本人確認書類を提出する必要はありません。</li>
    <li> 利用者登録を行う場合には、利用者ID及びパスワードをご指定いただきます。利用者は、利用者ID及びパスワードを、第三者に知られないよう利用者自身の責任において厳重に管理するものとします。利用者が利用者ID及びパスワードを第三者に知られたことにより生じた損害については、当社は一切責任を負わないものとします。</li>
    <li> 利用者登録を行う場合の契約期間は3年間とします。契約の満了日までに、利用者から解約の申し出がない限り契約は３年間自動更新され、以後も同様とします。</li>
    <li> 契約期間中、利用者より解約の申し出があった場合においても、解約手数料等の費用は発生いたしません。 </li>
    <li> 送金依頼後の送金状況の確認は、会員登録を完了した利用者の取引確認ページにて行うことができます。 </li>
</ol>

<h4>第9条の2 (利用者登録を行わない場合の本サービスの利用について)</h4>
<ol>
    <li> 利用者登録を完了していない送金依頼人が10万円以下の金額の送金依頼を行う場合には、利用者登録を行わずに送金を行うことが可能です。ただし、その場合においても、第６条第１項に定める一定の本人確認手続きがございます。</li>
    <li> 送金依頼後の送金状況の確認は、当社の発行する照会IDにより、オンライン上にて行うことができます。</li>
</ol>

<h4>第10条 (利用者の義務)</h4>
<ol>
    <li> 送金依頼人は、送金依頼にあたり、正確な情報を提供する義務を負うものとします。一旦、送金依頼が実行された場合、当該取引を取り消すことはできません。送金依頼人の指示に従って送金が実施されたことによって利用者が被る損害については、当社は一切の責任を負いません。</li>

        利用者が、想定したよりも多額の受取金額を受領した場合にも、当該利用者は、当社に対し直ちに通知する義務を負い、当該過払い金額は直ちに返還処理がなされます。</li>
    <li> 利用者は、本サービスをいかなる違法行為にも利用しないものとします。当社は、利用者の疑わしい行動、苦情または報告された違反行為について調査する権限を有します。調査の結果、当社が違法行為またはと違法行為と疑わしき行為であると認めた場合、当社は、監督官庁その他必要な個人または団体に対し、個人情報を含む送金関連情報を提供することができるものとします。</li>

        <ol>
