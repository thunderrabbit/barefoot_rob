<ol>
<li>I am training to work at Ty&rsquo;s (headed there now)</li>
<li>I have been transferring the CB backend to SB, where it will be
streamlined / focused on artists and their events instead of
artists and their products.</li>
<li>It has been over a year since I first considered giving up this
laptop for one on which I can run Ubuntu.</li>
<li>The only thing I don&rsquo;t like about this laptop now is the lack of
battery.</li>
<li>I meditated standing up this morning and last night.  By standing,
I was able to remain awake.</li>
<li>I just noticed the funny looking panel (featuring a guy in a yellow
suit) on the train has expanded to
two panels.  I guess it is some kinda campaign.</li>
<li>I have started taking Japanese lessons with Mel who&rsquo;s a native
Japanese speaker who&rsquo;s been willing to look at my homework between
lessons, and whose English is pretty darn good, being that she
lives in the US (and apparently tried hard to learn).</li>
<li>I have gotten positive feedback regarding being a good listener.</li>
<li>I have started doing counseling in my free time before teaching in
西麻布（にしあざぶ）</li>
<li>Lin has been out of town for two nights to see Mikako in 新潟.  I
was planning to go but prep for Ty and sb kept me here.</li>
<li>The owner of Christine&rsquo;s apartment has offered to replace the
carpet with flooring due to some kind of issue they were having
with it.</li>
<li>I used an old envelope I had had with an alpaca / llama sticker on
it to repay people who helped me the day I left my wallet at home.</li>
<li>I have been guiding my thinking with the underlying trust in the
idea &ldquo;the spirit world is real,&rdquo; which I have been hearing more
and more from people I have (casually) interviewed about their
ayajuasca experiences.</li>
<li>I will be taking a course with Soness soon.  She will help me
clarify my message regarding men&rsquo;s group work and personal growth
work in general.</li>
<li>I just learned the first names of けいこさん and さっちゃん
(short for さちこさん), two women who work in a news/snack stand
in the middle of a platform.  They had asked me last week about
being barefoot, and apparently didn&rsquo;t recognized me this week
until they noticed my bare feet.</li>
<li>I just heard a little 4 year old boy refer to himself using 俺（お
れ）, which I still don&rsquo;t use because I think my Japanese isn&rsquo;t
good enough.</li>
<li>日本語を書けますけど、今度これを読めますか？</li>
<li>I am beginning to try reading Japanese paragraphs, but the kanji
still gets me.  I probably can read 200 or so kanji and write 100
or so kanji.</li>
<li>I want to work on open source projects instead of all closed
source stuff.  Welll to be more clear, I want to work on more open
source projects for which I&rsquo;m the maintainer.  I have contributed
to some open source projects, but &hellip; Wait. even as I write this, I
realize I am misrepresenting the situation. I want to be able to
post code / ask questions without having to ask / cleanse the code
first.</li>
<li>Marble Track 3 is pretty open source, but it&rsquo;s hardware, and one
of a kind that will be pretty hard to duplicate.  I did not put a
password on the images, but have not yet figured out how (to
explain how) people can download the images.</li>
<li>Marble Track 3 has entered its fifth month of development (not
including making the cage/barrier to keep Jennie out). I think I
have worked 4.8 days on it, according to the livestreams I have on Youtube.</li>
<li>Just left Noborito.  Gonna change trains at the next station.
Peace out and see ya later, computer.</li>
