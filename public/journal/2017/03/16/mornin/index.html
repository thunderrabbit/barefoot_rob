<ol>
<li>The US shifted their clocks forward, so my online I-group now meets at 9:30am Tokyo time.  That means I do not have enough time to head home before the meeting, and that means I need to find Wifi.  I&rsquo;ve been using Wired Cafe in Lazona, and I will probably resume.  It also means I have my computer with me for this morning lesson to which students are often late.</li>
<li>Been doing lots of work for AB.  Added a field.. actually split a field into two pieces.  I thought date_available and date_marketable were the same.  False.  Well they have been the same in the DB for 6 years, so kinda true.</li>
<li>While doing all that work, I should be preparing to move them to Ubuntu 16.04</li>
<li>Apparently the CB project will end in June.  I hope it&rsquo;s not foolish to hope it&rsquo;s conceivable that it could possibly go smoothly.  Just sayin&rsquo; I miss having a project manager who can push back against certain requests.</li>
<li>I just taught a trial lesson yesterday for It&rsquo;s Me.  They were beginners, but genki and tried pretty hard.  First lesson starts a month from now; have to wait for new annual business cycle to start.</li>
<li>I gave a copy of Simon&rsquo;s book to Patrick.</li>
<li>TY had a baby!</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been going to SOGO since like August 2016.  I just invited Menya to my HHS presentation on March 28th.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ll be presenting Head Heart and Soul on March 28th.  It&rsquo;s basically an introduction into the type of emotional clearing / personal growth we do in my men&rsquo;s group.</li>
<li>I built a cage with chopsticks to surround my glass desk with a protective cat shield.  Inside the cage (which can be easily removed by people with thumbs (haha, cat!)), I plan to make a marble track.  Expect it to start soon after April.</li>
<li>In addition to weekly online I-group, I attend monthly I-group council call (being the representative for all the I-group<del>s</del> in Japan), and monthly Community Growth call (being that Japan has only one I-group).</li>
<li>One of the things suggested by the Community Growth team is to have patience.</li>
<li>I have not been meditating regularly.</li>
<li>I just started bringing my disk to SOGO so we can throw a bit after workout.  Only one taker 12 days ago, but about 4 people this past Sunday.</li>
<li>Student just arrived 11 minutes late.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>The morning weather was 2 degrees C, basically too cold for me to happily go barefoot, but it got up to 12 C today, which is relatively great barefoot weather.</li>
<li>I really enjoy teaching students who enjoy learning.  I wonder how long I can do it.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been watching Mythbusters on Netflix.  I&rsquo;m up to Season 4 now I think.  Interesting that Scottie just vanished from episodes, replaced by Grant without fanfare.  I hope she left on good terms.</li>
