<p>Oops we&rsquo;re arriving in Yokohama soon so not much time to write.</p>

<ol>
<li>Ted ran away; he has been gone 2 days.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been working on body and soul website with Sho</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been doing AB website for past couple years but not a lot of work now.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been taking Japanese lessons at 80s Cafe in Akihabara, up to 3
times per week (for about 2 weeks now).  Have also been studying
flashcards on Anki, Memrise, and reading TextFugu</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m a bit behind on mazes, well not &ldquo;behind&rdquo; exactly but just up to
date.  Need to get some more done quickly to get ahead of schedule
again.</li>
<li>Teaching for JB school a few days per week.  Teaching on Tuesday
mornings and evenings, Wednesday evenings, Thursday mornings and
evenings, and some weekend days.</li>
<li>Have been practicing Unity 2D development, trying to put as much on
github as possible (but recently removed some code from noobtuts&rsquo;
premium offering).</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m somewhat happy with my current direction of my website
setup.. I&rsquo;ve got b.robnugen.com just serving images (b for
&ldquo;binary&rdquo;, a throwback to the old FTP days where we had to tell
which way to transfer the files, as ascii or binary).
www.robnugen.com goes to my old account, but .htaccess quickly
tosses those requests to new.robnugen.com, which is still a bit
wonky as I&rsquo;ve not got my static site generator quite set up.
Middleman is slow as fuck and Hugo can&rsquo;t handle all-utf-8
filenames.
My end goal is to write a static site that contains all the content
from robnugen.com (journal, writings (including the inane stuff
from my wiki (R.O.B.O.T. and other crap I&rsquo;ve forgotten), and
possibly old crap I didn&rsquo;t write), and new stuff: Unity samples,
etc.
All of that should be kept in git via main repo and submodules.</li>
<li>Tariq and I have essentially finished our set of Japanese apps
based on Apple Memory and its little siblings.  One misspelling fix
is waiting for approval now, and we&rsquo;re trying to get the other app
approved, but they&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s confusingly similar to some other
app, which it&rsquo;s not similar to at all.</li>
<li>TJ Bike is outside, but his seat is ripped and soaked with
rainwater a lot of the time.  His chain is rusty, but we don&rsquo;t have
an indoor place to keep him.  I&rsquo;ve just been using Lin&rsquo;s bike, who
has new tires, but no name.</li>
<li>In Unity, so far, I&rsquo;ve just gone through noobtuts tutorials: Pong,
Tetris, and Bejeweled. I am trying to jump into my own project, but
maybe I should keep going through their other toots.</li>
<li>Each time I go down to Fukuura for my lesson, I take the KQ line to
something something station, where I take the Seaside Line, which
is fun because there&rsquo;s no driver and I can sit in front.</li>
<li>Lin is working in real estate again; it&rsquo;s busy and sometimes
stressful, but she&rsquo;s glad to be back in the industry.</li>
<li>Fred and I were talking nearly every day for a while, but haven&rsquo;t
in the past week or so.  I&rsquo;ve not talked to Ma for a while, but my
dad called me on my most recent birthday.</li>
<li>ママ lives in our house downstairs; she&rsquo;s still working early
shifts.  I&rsquo;ve vaguely been able to speak with her more since I
started studying Japanese.</li>
<li>My phone is iPhone 4S which I&rsquo;ve had for a while.  My computer is
aluminum MacBookPro which I&rsquo;ve had for about 3 years now.  It&rsquo;s
about to go out of warranty.  When it can no longer handle the most
up-to-date OS X, I&rsquo;m gonna put Ubuntu on it, and when it&rsquo;s too
tired for even that, I&rsquo;ll get a non-Apple laptop.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been doing 100 pushups per day. I did extra yesterday and only
20 or so today, but I&rsquo;m at 773 for the month, thanks to PUWF (push
ups with friends)</li>
