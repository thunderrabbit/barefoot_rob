<div class="dream">
On a bus with lots of people including two people who were co-workers.
One was a reporter who had been standing all day.  She said to the
other as she got off the bus that her feet hurt and she really wanted
a foot massages.  After she got off the bus, I asked him if I could
have her phone number to give her a massage.

He was like, "no" and left it at that because it was the expected
answer.

Then I go, "well, can I teach you how to give foot massage?"

He goes, "no; I don't have time for that."

After a while, he said, "let me give you some feedback."

I said "okay, I'm turning off my pone" as I turned off my phone; I
legitimately wante to hear it.

He said, "you're bugging me at work about massage when I have to work."

And I go okay, "I undersand you're busy, and I be you don't want to
learn how to give foot massage."

He goes, "no; I said I don't have time for it.."  He goes, "okay join
me for a reiki, shaanism, massage, I-group, programming, painting,
electron, barbershop, chromosome, motorized robotics, public speaking
class."

I go "okay,  When is it?"

He goes, "you have to teach it."

"Well, you said join before.  Anyway I don't know all those things so I
cannot teach them all; your scenario isn't analagous to mine, but I get
your essential point; You aren't interested in learning foot massage
to give to her."
