<ol>
<li>Maybe the biggest overall thing, which I <em>hope</em> will become a big
thing in the future: In October, I&rsquo;m going to staff a NWTA in
Perth, with other men from <a href="https://mkp.org">https://mkp.org</a></li>
<li>I have my plane tickets and all other costs are covered cause I&rsquo;m
coming from overseas.</li>
<li>I just bought a soft plastic stackable brick toy set for Lin&rsquo;s
clients&rsquo; son&rsquo;s enjoyment. PolyM, Art.-No. 73061 Helicopter, after
having been given the chance to play with a big box of the bricks
to make &ldquo;anything,&rdquo; so long as it fit on the shelf here next to
まい&rsquo;s creations.  I guess she was all created-out after making a
few different displays with the bricks.</li>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t take a picture of my creation, but it was kindof round;
the pieces are soft-ish and more forgiving than LEGO, both for
construction and trodding with bare feet!  I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re also
far less durable, but oh well.</li>
<li>Today I saw a note that c0de is stepping down from his many years
of hosting DELTA minecraft server.  I thanked him for his hard
work, and he&rsquo;ll certainly be missed!  (not that it will affect me
at this juncture; I haven&rsquo;t logged on to the server in months)</li>
<li>Today at work I helped Satomi fix her /etc/hosts file to reconnect
to a website which inexplicably has had its DNS misconfigured. I
mean how hard can it be?  I said, &ldquo;it should have the same IP
address as (ABC site),&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s still not fixed.</li>
<li>Mutsumi has retired from lessons for the time being.  He said he&rsquo;s
busy.  No, not Mutsumi!  The <em>other</em> Mutsumi!  Happily, Mutsumi&rsquo;s
still attending, and I&rsquo;m thankful for her hard work, both at study
and looking for other students to fill Mutsumi&rsquo;s place!</li>
<li>I haven&rsquo;t gone to Japanese class for months(?)</li>
<li>I haven&rsquo;t drawn a maze for a month?</li>
<li>BUT, Pop Pop Chaos is coming along pretty well.  I am sorta-close
to having rolling high score list implemented, but I just need to
deal with user&rsquo;s names having been stored in different locations
based on how they logged in (via U/P or Oauth).  Bubbles grow when
clicked, the turn dark in proportion to how close they are to
popping, and people reach the high score list based not on points,
but on <em>creates</em>, which require points to obtain.  I&rsquo;m pretty happy
with it so far.</li>
<li>The GG lesson used to be M, T, and Te, but now it&rsquo;s going to be
just M and Te.  And only for 1 hour instead of an hour an a half.
Boo, but still better than a big bowl of nothin&rsquo;.  Only problem is
M tends to speak more than Te, so I want to be careful to make sure
Te has enough talk time.</li>
<li>Had a new student today in other class (via Tariq); he&rsquo;ll join for
two months, which is perfect because C has said she&rsquo;ll be busy for
2 months.  She will hopefully enjoy slightly easier lessons than
what I had been doing to challege her before the new student
joined.</li>
