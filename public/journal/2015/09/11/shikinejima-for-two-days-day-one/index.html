<p>Mark and I are on an island featuring 500 permanent residents and
maybe as many tourists; I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>

<p>I wanted to climb on some rocks behind the whale statue, but he wanted
to go to the beach to check that out, so I climbed on rocks there.
Then I walked on rocks toward the onsen where there was some man made
pier which I poo-pooed as boring, but Mark wanted to check it out.  I
noticed water was flowing off it, so I thought &ldquo;hmmmm that could be
interesting!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I went to the end of the pier, and sure enough water came over the
top!  It was a bit thrilling to see the water well up from the ocean
and flood the pier about 10 cm over the top.  Wow!</p>

<p>The next wave came and &hellip; didn&rsquo;t make it over the top.  Then the next
one came and .. uh oh!  knocked me hard enough that I couldn&rsquo;t stand,
but I made it okay!  I may have gotten my phone a bit wet though.
Ooops!</p>

<p>Started to head back, and the next wave was like 50 cm over the top of
the pier!  Whoooosh I went sliding along the pier; water splooshed
over me and definitely drenched my jeans (and phone).</p>

<p>Ooops oops!</p>

<p>Fortunately, there were some curb-like things at the edge of the pier
which I planned to use to keep myself from going over the edge into
the water.   Double fortunately, I stopped sliding across the pier
before that time.  Triple fortunately, the pier was a bit slimy with
green algae or something so it didn&rsquo;t cut me up too much. Just a bit
on my left ankle and left elbow.  I tweeted &ldquo;slide, baby, slide!&rdquo; when
posting a (blurry) photo of the injuries.  Wanted a video of the
original event, though!  Might have to go back out there. Just kidding!</p>

<p>Without actually trying, the paragraph above has a perfect vertical
river near the right edge.  Check it out:</p>

<p>So anyway, fortunately my phone (and I) survived the drink, and I know
to be careful next time and put my phone somewhere safe before going
out onto that pier!</p>
