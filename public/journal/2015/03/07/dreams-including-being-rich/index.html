<div class="dream">
I needed a red mat for the kitchen like a non slip mat and went up a long road loooking forw one and found one

up a long hallway curivng to the right in a hotel and found one outisde a house, so I took it and walked back and then got all the way back and asked a guy if he new  knew where I could buy it and he goes yeah my brother and called his brother down and I bought a mat from him.  so I needed to take the mat I had stolen back up so we drove Lin dorve back up the long curve until I found the spot and gave the mat back, but it was  a black mat so I went back to teh car, and asked hir w her where the red one was.  she goes it's back at the house; I liked it better, so I sadi I needed to bring back the correct one later.


pretend playing ultimate frisbee with Pete or Dude or Jesse and I had just won 2 billion dollrs in fake money dude called my brother onto the field and introduced him as if famous, and then called a differetnt guy onto the field who was very short and we all cheered him on as if famous.  Then I went tot eh side and was like "hey can I play?" and he said and introduce Rob Nugen, new billionaire and I leapt onto he field that's  two billionaire, bitch! and fake started to punch him and stuff an we laughted
what about having a new suit tailor made before ach gae and destroy it during the game, like a new ten tohousand dollar suit

so I was at a tailor getting my suit done and I said, hey these seems aren't perfect and he started to redo them, redoing hours of work, and I asked
and he told me his name, and I asked hi

and she showed me teh romanji spelling and I was like no screw Englihs, show me your name in your native language.  and the letters looked like curvy cyrillic letters and he showed me how to spell his name.  I was so happy that I held his face and kissed him; thank you for teaching me your name, and he was like, O_o surprised but much happier to speak with me after that  We talked about his family and I was like, "take me to

let 's go to your house tomorrow..  Oh, I mean your home country, and he goes, "i need some time to get my affairs ready, and I jokingly said "no I don't care about your personal life, I want to meet your family hahahahahah  no just kidding it's a joke about not respecting your personal life so I can pay respects to your personal life" but the joke dind't go across very well     we saw the story of how I became wealthy through a misunderstanding as I was on a fake private jet and there was an anounement onboard that my then wife/girlfriend was lie,, "wot?" and divorced me so I made a shiton of money in the deal.

and the tailor was iike "what you weren't rich when you were born?" and I go no I guess not

my friend tried to rip open a seam like the tailor had done Wikam was hs name but it was proncouned Kiham which is why I wanted to see it in his langueage   but my friend fucked up he seam by ripping the actual fabric so tit would all have to be done again.

With Mutsumi at  an interesting shop with lots of machine tools including some acidic powedre which was apparently used to "seal" rabtis and dogs fand cats feet in a process called "protection" so tere was a campaign using green and ellow log "against protection" and I was so moved by reading the story ,w chich was printed across the labels of several products haning in his shop, including some with just one word per labels like one word of the story was written on the package of the product

I was like where can I get the "against protection" stickers?  and he said, Utah so I  planned to have Fred get some because he worked for BNCE, and then I realized oh BMCE but close enough certainly he can get stickers   Then Mutsumi was walking home with me on some railroad tracks and said Lin had made fish for her and her mom, but that I woud only get fried rice. because of my diet.  We were twalking in fired rice on the train tracks so it made sense.
