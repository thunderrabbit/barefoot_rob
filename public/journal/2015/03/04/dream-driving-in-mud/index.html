<div class="dream">
In a large city the train was late or otherwise displaced but we
arrived on time on the right hand side of a large building where we had
been.

Everyone was lined up in three lines, waiting for the van to be ready.
I jokingly ran up to be in front of one of the lines in front of a
youth to tease her, but she wasn't phased by my cutting in line. I was
like, "wow I like how Meg (R) didn't even care."  I got out of line as
they started to move forward and get in the van.

Driving in the van in a large muddy area with several youth in the
back, my van was a bicycle and I was driving very carefully so it
wouldn't be bumpy, but I coudln't put my foot down cause I would get
stuck.

As we left, I saw my acquaintence who was a big bald guy who looked
like Michael "Tiny" from SC back at UH I was like "hey man see you
soon; we're gonna hang out cause Spring is coming!" He was like "yeah
let's do it!" or something equally affirmative.

Lin was driving another bicycle but had low air pressure and couldn't
make it up a relatively steep embankment; we were in a crater shaped
bowl of dirt and she couldn't ride up the side wall.  She goes, "can
you help me?" and I was like, "hang on" because I coudln't stop riding
or put my foot down I ended up doing a large slow kickout with my back
tire and hoped everyone inside the van was okay.
