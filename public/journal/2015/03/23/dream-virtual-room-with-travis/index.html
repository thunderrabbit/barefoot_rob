<p class="dream">
Travis and I were in a virtual reality on my computer.  He showed me a
room that was similar to what I had seen before, so I almost didn't go
inside to explore.  Then I was like, "wait if Travis showed me this,
it must be cool" so I went inside to check the place out.  It was
*amazing* with 3D virtual games inside the groom, a hologram which
could be manipulated by touching the screen and project into the room;
and some hidden rooms behind the walls with hinged doors on mirrors
that caused the hologram to reflect "infinitely" back and forth; it
was so realistic that I made a joke "the Matrix is everywhere".
</p>

<p class="dream">
I found a super hidden corner which even Travis hadn't heard about
while reading people's logs about exploring the place; it was hidden
behind an inflatable statue and in between the statue and the wall was
a panel that could be opened and revealed a mirror hinged between a
panel hinged between a mirror and the mirrors were offset from each
other so I wondered how they functioned while hinged like that.  I
pulled the device out and showed Travis but he said he hadn't seen it
before.  Wow. I was one of the first people on the internet to find
this part of this virtual room!  Travis said he had to get going and
was glad that I had enjoyed the place.  Most def!  So we started to
lock up everything the way we had found it and one door was unable
to lock because its adjoining latch was on a frame that had been bent
so that the door coudln't reach it anymrore. I guessed we had to leave
that part open.
</p>

<p class="dream">
I saw that Travis had picked up a lot of broken glass to clean up the
place and I got a trtansmission from Marcel who was like, "dude are
you still there?" cause he had read my journal entry about it and
wanted to see the place as well, so he beamed over and I was like,
"Duuuuude!" and he was like "Duuuuuude!!" and I introduced Travis
and Marcel and then they were talking for a bit but Travis had to go
so Marcel was talking to me to see the new thing I had found.  I
told him I forgot to take pictures and he was like, "aw man I knew
I should have contacted you sooner!"
</p>

<p class="dream">
I stepped over a virtual tar pit  and started to wake up.
