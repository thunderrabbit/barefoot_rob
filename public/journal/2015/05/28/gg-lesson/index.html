<h2 id="20-44-thursday-28-may-2015-jst">20:44 Thursday 28 May 2015 JST</h2>

<p>Today before GG lesson, T asked A (in English) if she had read M&rsquo;s email.  A said
she had not.</p>

<p>I used this simple exchange as the basis for fully 45 minutes of
lesson:</p>

<pre><code>T: &quot;Did you read M's email?&quot;
A: &quot;No I didn't.&quot;

R: &quot;What did you ask her?&quot;
T: &quot;I asked her if she had read M's email.&quot;
R: &quot;and what did she say?&quot;
T: &quot;She said she hadn't.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>(^_^)V</p>

<pre><code>R: &quot;What did she ask you?&quot;
A: &quot;She asked me if I had read M's email.&quot;
R: &quot;and what did you tell her?&quot;
A: &quot;I told her I hadn't.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>(^_^)V</p>

<p>Then, when M arrived, I asked her to ask T what she had asked A.</p>

<pre><code>M: &quot;What did you ask A?&quot;
T: &quot;I asked her if she had read your email.&quot;
M: &quot;What did she say?&quot;
T: &quot;She said she hadn't.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>(^_^)V</p>

<p>And then I had M ask A what she had been asked.</p>

<pre><code>M: &quot;What did T ask you?&quot;
A: &quot;She asked me if I had read your email.&quot;
M: &quot;What did you tell her?&quot;
A: &quot;I told her I hadn't.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>(^_^)V</p>

<p>And then we went a step deeper.</p>

<pre><code>R: &quot;Sorry, M, what did you ask T?&quot;
M: &quot;I asked her what she had asked A.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>(^_^)V</p>

<pre><code>R: &quot;T, what did M ask you?&quot;
T: &quot;She asked me what I had asked A.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>(^_^)V</p>

<pre><code>R: &quot;A, what did M ask T?&quot;
A: &quot;She asked what T had asked me.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>(^_^)V</p>

<p>Then, while I was checking homework, M smartly asked T if she could
see her notebook (which I had just corrected).</p>

<pre><code>R: &quot;What did you ask her?&quot;
M: &quot;I asked her if she would show me her notebook.&quot;
M: &quot;I aksed her if I could see her notebook.&quot;
M: &quot;I asked for her notebook.&quot;
</code></pre>
