<div class="dream">
In a school, Lin and I walked up some steps to a counter where we were
to pick up our tickets for travel.   The guy was like, do you have
your stripe card? which I had been given but couldn't find at that
moment.  I found it latler in a different pocket of my wallet (change
compartnemtn) and moved it to the first plae I had looked for it,
while thinking of the LPT I had seen regarding this, though Iit was
already a practice I practice.  On the boat, we were headed from Viet
Nam back to Japan and were looking at options for travel.  One way was
shorter but had strong currents against us, but we chose that way
anyway and were turning into the current area when the driver got back
in the boat and I had been turning it.  We were next to some other
boats in this industrial waste wasted sea and there was no food from
the ocean, but a guy had broght ramen.  Lin was looking for food as
she didn't want to eat industrial waste and I was just going to go
hungry instead; it was only one more day.
