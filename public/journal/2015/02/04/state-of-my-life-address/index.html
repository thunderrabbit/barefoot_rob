<ol>
<li><p>TL;DR: I&rsquo;m really happy with my situation right now.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;m working for a few different people/companies, going to
different places each day.  Mostly I&rsquo;m teaching English, but also
doing website work for AB and probably do some more website work for a
different project, &ldquo;coming soon&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>On new moon weekends, I&rsquo;ve been attending
<a href="www.meetup.com/Tokyo-ET-Contact-Group/">Tokyo ET Contact</a> meetups,
organized by Mark, and on some other weekends, I&rsquo;ve been attending
<a href="https://www.meetup.com/Tokyo-Reiki-Circle/">Tokyo Reiki Circle</a>
meetups.  When there&rsquo;s a conflict, I go with ET group because it&rsquo;s
only once a month.</p></li>

<li><p>Otherwise, I have a lot of free time to fitz around with my
website, chat with Fred online, make art, meditate, and play with the
cats.</p></li>

<li><p>Oh, and free time to do laundry and think about cleaning and cooking!</p></li>

<li><p>Lin is back in real estate, coming home each night saying she had a
good day.  I&rsquo;m super happy about that!</p></li>

<li><p>Lin seems to only be able to relax if the house is clean, which I
know, but don&rsquo;t really understand.  I&rsquo;m often like, &ldquo;yo baby don&rsquo;t
worry about it&rdquo; and sometimes help her clean, but egad it already
seems clean enough to me!  Plus it&rsquo;s just gonna get dirty again
anyway!</p></li>

<li><p>We have a subscription to Hulu and watch movies on it pretty
regularly; maybe 3 per week.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;m considering moving from Hakyll to Pelican since I&rsquo;m
too&hellip; lazy/disinterested in learning Haskell, and my knight in
programming armor has gotten too busy to add the extras to what he
made already.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;m still evaluating Pelican, though.  Need to make sure I can
make it do the things I want, which I haven&rsquo;t necessarily defined
well.</p>

<p>a. pagination
b. calendar
c. Dream CSS
d. tags
e. categories
f. date based on filename and meta data
g. images
h. Unity apps</p></li>

<li><p>1% chance I will split my non-art categories from my wiki to static
pages on my site.  Actually yeah that&rsquo;s a pretty good idea; the only
reason I have art on wiki is so that other people can edit the pages
for the particular piece they obtained. So let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s a 2% chance
= 100% chance I think it&rsquo;s a great idea now * <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> ability to
prioritize it anytime soon.</p></li>

<li><p>I think I&rsquo;ll make a category called &ldquo;ridiculous&rdquo; or something; it
can hold my R.O.B.O.T. pages and other crap I pooped out some years
ago.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve switched robnugen.com to use www.robnugen.com; Travis
explained that having domain names which are substrings of other
domain names is a (Javascript?) security hole.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;m going to let airplaneday.com and isfuzzywilltravel.com expire;
I&rsquo;ve not don&rsquo;t shit with those domains in years so they&rsquo;re just
wasting money.  Oh, and pekoneko.com.  That was for Hitomi.</p></li>

<li><p>I want to evaluate my robnugen.com subdomains.  Some of them are
shit; some are empty.  I will move each one to its own (virtual)
server, or wipe it off the proverbial face of the internet.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>1.
Definitely want to keep the following:</p>

<pre><code>a. wiki.robnugen.com (for my art)
b. art.robnugen.com (shortlinks to my art)
c. www.robnugen.com (blog and shit (hopefully all static))
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li><p>without looking at what exists, I can&rsquo;t think of any others I care about.</p></li>

<li><p>I was going to be in a drug trial at CPC for the first two weeks of
this month (Feb 2015) but I wasn&rsquo;t selected after passing the initial
medical check.  I guess it was a lottery-type selection process.</p></li>

<li><p>Tariq and I have switched to Unity for further app
development. It&rsquo;s become clear that I&rsquo;m unable to keep up with the iOS
updates, plus I&rsquo;m definitely not able to write for Android, etc, while
writing for iOS so we&rsquo;re hoping Unity can help deploy to multiple
platforms.</p></li>

<li><p>So far, I&rsquo;ve just done the first roll-a-ball tutorial, and expanded
on that a little bit.  I&rsquo;ve not even figured out a cool and consistent
way to &hellip; oh I know.. there&rsquo;s gotta be a reasonable way to do it with
Pelican.  I just want to slap the files on my site, optionally with
links to source code.</p></li>

<li><p>I read on Reddit someone suggesting that <em>all</em> software will be
open source in the future.  I guess it&rsquo;s a nice idea, and I hope it
comes to pass, but I dunno.  Smert algorithms could keep up with the
pace of development without the need for an army of devs + testers.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;m happy to open source any programming projects I write on my
own, but interestingly, I&rsquo;m not yet willing to open source my art.
I&rsquo;m not sure why, though.</p></li>

<li><p>Lin and I live in Kawasaki.  I&rsquo;ve sent four (4) postcards on
<a href="https://www.postcrossing.com/">postcrossing.com</a>, and received two
(2).</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve sent a few emails encrypted with PGP (GPG) extension on
Thunderbird.  Still haven&rsquo;t quite sorted out how to do all the key
(signing) business, but it&rsquo;s definitely interesting stuff.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to some of Andrew Basiago&rsquo;s statements about
the future come to pass.</p></li>

<li><p>I have taught a few substitute lessons at Toshiba, but don&rsquo;t yet
have a consistent schedule there.  They&rsquo;ve got some really interesting
exhibits, about which I enjoy learning more.</p></li>

<li><p>We have two cats (Jennie and Ted), but zero dogs or kids.  Jennie
and Ted are getting along pretty well, and have been peeing in their
designated place for a while.  I would love to let them outside, but
we agreed upon their adoption that we&rsquo;d keep them inside, safe from
city life.</p></li>

<li><p>I pretty regularly can &ldquo;pop&rdquo; my neck, by tilting my head
backwards.  I&rsquo;m sue that&rsquo;s a symptom of &lsquo;text neck&rsquo;, so I&rsquo;ve been
trying to maintain better posture, but it&rsquo;s hard to do so with my
current lifestyle.</p></li>

<li><p>I don&rsquo;t have a train pass because I don&rsquo;t use the trains enough
times in a month to make it worthwhile.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven&rsquo;t spoken with my dad in a bit; maybe I&rsquo;ll try to connect
with him soon.</p></li>

<li><p>Holy shit I just saw a Japanese(?) couple embrace with long hug
and passionate kiss.  They hugged for more than like 15 seconds each
time, and he held her face and kissed her.  So happy for them!</p></li>
