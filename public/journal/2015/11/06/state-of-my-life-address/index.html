<h2 id="18-59-friday-06-november-2015-jst">18:59 Friday 06 November 2015 JST</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>As I write this, I&rsquo;m going the long way home around the Yamanote
Line; I just sat down at Shinjuku station, and I plan to switch to
the Keihin Tohoku Line in Ueno or somewhere convenient.</p></li>

<li><p>Have had a few tickets stacking up for AB and CB websites, but on 1
November, I released version 2.0.0 of both the frontend and backend
of the AB website.  It uses a new system for logins which allows
the login to be decoubpled from the persona using the site.  Soon,
different &ldquo;types&rdquo; of users will be able to log in.</p></li>

<li><p>CB site has requested a few changes as part of their low-key
redesign. Basically they want to redo the entire site, but I don&rsquo;t
know how to design well enough to do it, so we&rsquo;re doing it kinda
piecemeal.  16 November will be the next visible change.</p></li>

<li><p>Lin and I have started thinking about buying land &ldquo;out in the
country.&rdquo;  I&rsquo;m happy to do it just as an investment; I imagine its value
will appreciate more quickly than if the money just rots in the
bank.  Lin has a bit more practical aspirations, so somewhere in
between we&rsquo;ll probably get a house that&rsquo;s not too far out and can
be &ldquo;fixed up&rdquo; in a reasonable amount of time, whatever that means.</p></li>

<li><p>I drew a vision board-ish thing showing the land we&rsquo;d like to buy,
featuring a stream and some adjacent open land on which MKP
trainings can be held.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve been in touch with a guy in the US who&rsquo;s starting an import
business, so in a way I&rsquo;m starting an export business.  No one has
profited yet except the post office and convenience store where I
paid for shipping within Japan, but it&rsquo;s still a fun project for
now.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve not been studying Japanese recently, but I sorta kinda have
considered possibly starting again.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve not been drawing mazes recently, and I haven&rsquo;t really
considered starting again as much as I&rsquo;ve thought about studying
Japanese again.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve started drawing images again.  It takes a bit of effort to
create all the meta data: posting them to my wiki, my URL
shortener, and Patreon, but it&rsquo;s still pretty fun.</p></li>

<li><p>I recently bought some new markers, but haven&rsquo;t used them yet!
Hopefully I will like the colors.</p>

<p><a href="/images/art/supplies/markers_2015-11-06_21.55.20.jpg"><img src="/images/art/supplies/thumbs/markers_2015-11-06_21.55.20.jpg" alt="markers" /></a></p></li>

<li><p>I sent Fred&rsquo;s 2016 journal today.  He likes that late nights and
weekend days get ample space for entries.</p></li>

<li><p>I may start teaching lessons on Friday night; it&rsquo;s for a single
semester if in fact they decide to start.  Trial lesson is next
week or something.</p></li>

<li><p>Ted has started coming back into the house, but he hasn&rsquo;t yet
stayed inside with the door closed.  He regularly comes in to eat,
snoop around the house a bit, and go back out.  We could close the
door while he&rsquo;s in snooping mode, but I want him to feel
comfortable that he can go back out.</p></li>

<li><p>Lin has been working lots at work, and I often don&rsquo;t see her until
10pm at night.  She enjoys the work, using English while helping
her clients, and getting to see lots of different houses.</p></li>

<li><p>We recently bought a Dyson vacuum cleaner, which is battery
operated, and lighter than our previous plug-in version.  It&rsquo;s
pretty neat, and has their signature clear dust catcher in which
all the dander has a party before heading on a new adventure.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;m planning to give Lin a massage coupon which says something
like <em>2016 Special Massage Coupon</em>, and has a checkbox by each
month of the year, plus an extra checkbox in March for her
birthday, and July for our anniversary.  Don&rsquo;t tell her.</p></li>

<li><p>Also planning to get her Harrod&rsquo;s Bears for 2011 and 2015, to
bookend the three she has already.  Don&rsquo;t tell her.</p></li>

<li><p>Pop Pop Chaos features variable pricing for bubbles!  There are
about 600 blue bubbles now, and they cost about 700 points to make
new ones.  There are approximately 0 green bubbles now, and
whoever logs in can <em>gain</em> points for creating new ones.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve kinda mussed up user thunderrabbit on the game though; I
hyper-clicked to create blue bubbles and laughed as Meteor didn&rsquo;t
keep up with my clicks, allowing me to go past my point credit
limit.  Then it caught up and I&rsquo;m in the red like 75000 points.  Dang.</p></li>

<li><p>My plan to meet Lin tonight worked!  I&rsquo;ve just switched to
Keihin-Tohoku line in Ueno (by simply walking across the
platform), chose one of the plentiful seats, and will arrive in
Kawasaki around the same time as Lin so we can have a nice date!</p></li>

<li><p>Tariq and I have been working on an app for Apple TV; it&rsquo;s sorta
kinda almost finished, though I still need to work out a couple of
bits that I&rsquo;m not sure how to do.  It basically presents 140
business vocabulary words which are the most commonly used + most
commonly unknown by his students.  Tariq has worked for 10 years
compiling the list, so it&rsquo;s certainly valuable!</p></li>

<li><p>Tokyo I-group will have its first open meeting on Monday November
16th in Hiroo from 6pm - 8pm.  One of my mates from Japan will
join us; I&rsquo;m optimistic he will benefit from the work and attend
regularly.</p></li>

<li><p>This coming Saturday Lin and I will be going to a Reiki share in
Asakusa.  Oh maybe while we&rsquo;re in the area we can get some good
prezzies for people in the US for belated Christmas.</p></li>

<li><p>While in Texas, Lin and I plan to go skydiving, eat steak, and get
officially married in the US!  Might even get a driver&rsquo;s license
for me, cause they cost $3000 in Japan.</p></li>

<li><p>Haha I just realized this is the second time I&rsquo;ve been in
Hamamatsucho today.  First time was for a lesson, and I left on
Yamanote Line; this time is just passing through on Keihin Tohoku
Line.</p></li>

<li><p>At the toy store I visit each week before MM lesson, I found an
intricate maze puzzle had been broken with a bit of brute force,
probably applied by an over enthusiastic person.  The store
employees were like, &ldquo;welp, you can have it!&rdquo; and I was like,
&ldquo;yay!&rdquo; cause I fixed it in about an hour (not counting time to let
the glue dry), and it&rsquo;s perfect now.  Retail price 5800 yen or so.</p></li>

<li><p>I should show the maze to Travis before taking it to the US.  It&rsquo;s
basically the same architecture as he suggested once, but with one
extra, um, twist.</p></li>

<li><p>Speaking of Travis, I left my neobbbbium magnets at his house a
couple weeks ago when we went for a visit to see them and Johan,
Matt, and Claire.  Maybe we can arrange for a swap; I&rsquo;ll show him
the maze (before taking it to Fred in the US) in exchange for the
magnets.  (not that they&rsquo;re being held hostage)</p></li>

<li><p>In Minecraft, I <code>/sethome</code> in a cave under a lava-soaked
mountain.  I immediately dug a staircase down to level 10 or so,
and have been digging a &ldquo;huge&rdquo; hole around the staircase, just
because it&rsquo;s funny.  Man, what a waste of time.</p>

<p>I need to somehow convince myself to spend as much time drawing in
real life as I do digging in Minecraft.</p></li>

<li><p>Lin and I have been eating much(!) more healthily for &hellip; a week
now.</p></li>

<li><p>For the past three weeks, I have joined an online I-group on
Thursday mornings, Tokyo time.  I guess at a basic level it
amounts to life coaching and holding each other accountable for
achieving our individual personal goals.</p></li>

<li><p>Yesterday in Kamata, I taught three (3) lessons, featuring a total
of 8 young students between ages 6 and 11.  The best thing is that
in the nearby convenience store, I found my <em>favorite</em> candy bars
still available!  I saw them &ldquo;everywhere&rdquo; for a while, but then
stopped seeing them.. It&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re no longer being
produced. boooo</p></li>

<li><p>Still haven&rsquo;t really nailed down our plans for the US.  It&rsquo;s kinda
weird to have things to do during vacation; how can I plan shit if
I have no idea what other fun things will be available?</p></li>

<li><p>In general, I&rsquo;m teaching 6 lesson hours per week, programming
about 25 hours per week, most of which is done at home with the
cats catting around the balcony door.</p></li>

<li><p>Arriving in Kawasaki now; see ya in a sec while I chill out at the
clock to wait for Lin.</p></li>

<li><p>I did <em>not</em> end up buying a new computer a few months ago when I
was preparing for this one to go to the shop for its
end-of-warranty checkup.  So, I&rsquo;m still using my MacBook Pro,
which is now about 3+ years old, I guess.  I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ve
made an entry for it in my <code>Items:</code> category on my wiki.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;m still using my iPhone 4S, with iOS 7.1 or so.  The lastest
models are iPhone 6S and iOS 9 or so.  I&rsquo;m sorta-kinda looking for
a replacement phone; I will almost certainly go with Android.</p>

<p>BUT, I don&rsquo;t really want to give up this phone since I have an
uncapped unlimited data plan for a fixed price.  That plan is
apparently no longer available, so I&rsquo;m sure that when I switch
phones, they&rsquo;ll force me to pay for a different plan.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve recently purchased unlimited encrypted storage on SpiderOak,
for $149 per year.  It sounds great, but I don&rsquo;t see a way to just
toss data on their servers without it <em>also</em> residing on my device
here.  I guess if I have N computers, I can store all of their
data separately; .. hmm maybe I&rsquo;ll try to install a SpiderOak
client on my not-really-used Ubuntu machine which is essentially
just wasting away on my desk.  (it&rsquo;s the one I got as a possible
(interim) replacement for this machine.)</p></li>

<li><p>I need to pee, but Lin&rsquo;s about to arrive in about 2 minutes haha</p></li>

<li><p>Recently Hideo sent me an email with dates of a clinical trial in
January, but we&rsquo;ll be in the US.  I guess I won&rsquo;t be going down
there again unless they have trials with an age limit above 45!</p></li>

<li><p>I recently took apart a little ionizer thing that Lin said didn&rsquo;t
work anymore.  I extracted its squirrel cage blower (did someone
say generator??) and may play with it, but it&rsquo;s pretty low
priority now.</p></li>

<li><p>I gave blood a bit more than three months ago, so I&rsquo;ve just added
an alarm to remind me to give blood again soon.</p></li>
