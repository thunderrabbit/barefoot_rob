<ol>
<li>I recently received two Dell laptops.  One had Windows 7 on it, so I&rsquo;ve left that.  The other had no hard drive, so I bought a new 700GB drive and put Debian on it.  It didn&rsquo;t have wifi, so I bought a USB nano wifi dongle.  Still couldn&rsquo;t wifi, so I installed Debian again to see if it would pick up the wifi automatically.  Nope, so I installed Linux Mint, but didn&rsquo;t like it, so I&rsquo;m back to Debian, but this time trying to get the internal wifi card to work. No luck yet, but I&rsquo;m still confident in my plan get it working.</li>
<li>Today I met new student TEM. It was a trial lesson, so we&rsquo;ll see if she joins.</li>
<li>Recently I&rsquo;ve been entering sentences in to my new anki flashcard type.  Basically sentences using the word in question, and then the word itself. then pronunciations and translations of each.</li>
<li>Recently my right elbow has been hurting.  I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s due to too much mousing.  I thought I had my mouse close enough to a neutral position, but apparently not.</li>
<li>We regularly let Jennie outside now.  Lin has come to realize that Jennie will come back after not too long.  Thus far I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s spent the night outside, though she&rsquo;s been outside at night.</li>
<li>S has moved on from the toy store and seems to have gotten a manager position or something at a different branch. Great for her! M now chats with me when I go to the toy store.  Recently we&rsquo;ve been playing with tops, and yesterday we flew a styrofoam airplane.</li>
<li>Tariq and I are working in Unity3D to make our version of pong, which is sorta kinda ready for its version 1 release.</li>
<li>There are a few different design competitions that I&rsquo;ve entered recently.  Who knows what will come of those?</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been attending Japanese classes at 80&rsquo;s Cafe in Akihabara 2 or 3 times per week. Along with my Thursday GG class, that puts me in Akiba 3 or 4 times per week! It&rsquo;s allllmost enough to warrant a teiki.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p>It&rsquo;s the beginning of the month and I happen to have written to my old i-group:</p>

<p>Yesterday while walking through Ebisu, who should I see, but E; what a surprise!  We had a nice chat and I thought it was high time for a group check-in.</p>

<p>Lin and I are married, living in Kawasaki.  We have no kids, but we have a cat!</p>

<p>Lin&rsquo;s super busy with work, enjoying her job as a real estate agent.  She&rsquo;s off today, and we just had a heart-to-heart discussion about the challenges of juggling career and relationship.  At the end of the discussion we agreed it&rsquo;s a struggle and worth it to persevere.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m working a variety of jobs teaching English and programming websites and apps with the goal of making passive income.</p>

<p>About once per month, I&rsquo;ve been attending ET Contact events&hellip; basically using meditation and consciousness to invite benevolent extra terrestrial intelligent beings to engage in mutually beneficial dialogue.  We haven&rsquo;t really &ldquo;met ET&rdquo; yet, but have heard and seen some interesting anomalous sounds and lights.</p>

<p>In my free time, I must say I&rsquo;ve been mostly attached to my computer, sometimes for too many hours at a time!  Part of that goes to creating mazes for my website <a href="https://www.amazeaweek.net/">https://www.amazeaweek.net/</a>, but a lot of it goes down the proverbial tubes, watching cat videos and porn (not at the same time).</p>

<p>Some of my time wasting is due to not taking care of myself when Lin is working long hours.  I judge I need to learn to take care of myself a bit better.</p>

<p>Sometimes I miss having a partner with whom I can speak easily.  Lin and I use English, but she&rsquo;s self taught, and has a few rough spots.  I feel sadness/anger if I judge I&rsquo;m not being heard, so when she can&rsquo;t understand me, it&rsquo;s a nice opportunity for me to be aware of those feelings.</p>

<p>On the golden side, I&rsquo;ve started studying Japanese to help a bit with communication, though it&rsquo;s a challenging language (as you may know)!</p>

<p>Studying Japanese also helps me feel joy (what&rsquo;s the opposite of shame?); I feel/felt some shame each time I tell people how long I&rsquo;ve been in Japan (12 years) and how terrible my Japanese language still is (but getting better step by step).</p>
