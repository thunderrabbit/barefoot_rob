<h2 id="15-12-tuesday-29-december-2015-jst">15:12 Tuesday 29 December 2015 JST</h2>

<p>Okay so when I got back from OZ, upon arrival in Narita, I was
approached by a TV crew who asked why I was barefoot and why I was
coming to Japan.</p>

<p>I wish I had just been honest, but I told them what I <em>wished</em> I was
doing: traveling barefoot around the country for 3+ months.  They were
like, &ldquo;wow so can we follow you around?&rdquo; I was caught in my lie!  I
would <em>LOVE</em> for you to come follow me around Japan, if only I were
going to travel around Japan!</p>

<p>Dammit, so I kept the lie going, &ldquo;um, no, um because it&rsquo;s difficult um
because if I&rsquo;m on camera I might not act natural.&rdquo;  (true, see? here
I am lying because of the camera)</p>

<p>They said okay and asked if they could see the bottom of my feet.  No
worries.</p>

<p>Okay, so bye!  and I walked away, assuming the camera was watching me,
I didn&rsquo;t look back until I got out of sight.</p>

<p>Okay, so they got their footage (hehe), but now I gotta go confess.  I
went back up the escalator and found them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah, um, so I lied because I thought it would sound good on TV.  I
actually live in Japan and have lived here for 12 years, but yes, I
often go around barefoot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I started composing a reply, but before I could get to an internet connection, he wrote again:</p>

<pre><code>Sorry for mailing you again.  In the airing, we keep the fact that
you live in Japan secret until the end of the airing.  (&quot;the end
of the airing&quot; means &quot;the scene you come back to our clew to
explain your living in Japan&quot;) So, the picture should be taken in
the U.S or, if taken in Japan, the background of the pictures is
not Japanese like.  Do you have pics like that??
</code></pre>

<p>I replied naively</p>

<pre><code>Hmmm; I might have some, but I'm not sure.  My wife and I are
going to the US in late January, so I can take those types of
pictures in the US and send them to you by February 1.

I'd be happy to do another interview on camera, or even have your
camera crew with me for a day in my actual normal life.  We could
go somewhere fun like Yomiuri Land, or Korakuen.. or somewhere
normal like Yoyogi Park or Meiji Jingu.

As a start, we could simply go to a shrine for New Year's Eve this
coming Thursday night if you like.

You can interview my wife about my bare feet as well.
</code></pre>

<p>And he replied as follows.  (Of course they already have plans for new years!)</p>

<pre><code>Thank you so much for your reply.  The airing will be Jan. 25th,
and I'm glad if you send them before the date of airing.  So, the
picture is to be taken in Japan if you don't have one taken in the
U.S.  I think pictures of you in Yoyogi park or somewhere in the
street can be either way to be taken in U.S or Japan.  (Like you
sitting on the bench, or walking on the street)

As for another filming, it could be true if we meet up in the
airport again.  In the New Year's Eve, we are going to Comic
market and film OTAKU foreigners.  So, please wait until next
year.
