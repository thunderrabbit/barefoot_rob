<p>This is the second statement for us to ponder, after &ldquo;Language is like
cake.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="anyone-who-speaks-the-language-can-teach-the-language">Anyone who speaks the language can teach the language</h3>

<p>(I cropped from the final version the indented crap in the middle)</p>

<p>I apparently taught my brother how to count, just through repetition.
This was at an age early enough that I don&rsquo;t remember it.  Animals
learn through repetition; we learn through repetition.  Repetition
accounts for many types of learning, but is the teacher actually
teaching? Is a lioness teaching when she hunts?  I dunno, but her prey
better learn quickly or risk failing the pop quiz.  This kind of
learning really comes down to the learner, not the teacher.</p>

<p>This is the essential difference between learning a native language
and learning a second language.  Bootstrapping the native language out
of nothing comes from sheer repetition, while learning a second
language uses the first language as a framework for the concepts of
communication.</p>

<p>In some cases, the similarity of the native language framework means
the second language will come rather easily.  It&rsquo;s no secret that
Romance languages are similar.  It&rsquo;s probably relatively easy to find
people who can teach between these languages.</p>

<pre><code>Italian, French, Spanish Just look at the similarities here
https://ielanguages.com/romance_phrases.html

In my case, I've basically given up learning Japanese; the grammar is
backwards, the writing is insane, and a great amount of cultural
knowledge is required just to figure out what's going on.

My American English framework (and sheer laziness) are a poor starting
place for learning Japanese.

Hmm I seem to have veered off topic.

So the mythical magical teacher who can lead a horse to water *and*
make him drink is darn near impossible to find.
</code></pre>

<p>But what about languages which are quite different? R.L.G. says
&ldquo;languages farther from your own in the linguistic family tree will be
harder for you to learn.&rdquo; (1) Therefore, I posit the art of presenting
a target language to native speakers of a dissimilar language in a way
that it can fit within the student&rsquo;s existing language framework <em>and</em>
remain interesting enough to keep the student motivated must surely be
honed over years of practice!</p>
