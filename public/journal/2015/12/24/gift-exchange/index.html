<h2 id="23-32-thursday-24-december-2015-jst">23:32 Thursday 24 December 2015 JST</h2>

<p>I bought the bear Lin wanted (after telling her repeatedly that I
would not).  It&rsquo;s been in a bag on the shelves next to my bed for
nearly a month I guess.</p>

<p>Last night before Lin got home, I took her oldest bear from its spot
in the living room and exchanged it with the new bear, which has
somewhat darker fur, but still &ldquo;light brown&rdquo; moreso that &ldquo;dark brown&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lin arrived hom and we sat on the couch to chat and she didn&rsquo;t notice
the bear!  Yay my plan worked!</p>

<p>After a while I was like, &ldquo;so when am I going to get my presents???&rdquo;
and she said &ldquo;close your eyes&rdquo; and gave me a cool headlamp with
rechargable batteries!</p>

<p>To present her with her present, I said, &ldquo;open your eyes,&rdquo; hoping she
might think to look at the bears whose sibling she wants.  She might
have, but didn&rsquo;t notice, her perception having been overwritten with
my having said I wouldn&rsquo;t buy her a bear this year.</p>

<p>She didn&rsquo;t see the bear and was like, &ldquo;surprise!  it&rsquo;s nothing!&rdquo; when
I said &ldquo;surprise!&rdquo; hoping she would see it.</p>

<p>After a bit I said &ldquo;okay close your eyes&rdquo; and went to get the new
bear&rsquo;s bag container her old bear and her other present, which I
presented first.  I sang a freestyle close your eyes song to the tune
of the Bangels&rsquo; &ldquo;Eternal Flame&rdquo;.. something like</p>

<pre><code>close your eyes,
hold out your hand
baby
and I will go get your present
do you understand
can you feel the anticipation?
I hope you enjoy your present
because it's the one
that I got for you
</code></pre>

<p>I hid the bear bag by the couch and gave her the flat present which
was wrapped with a photocopy of some English article I had used for my
students.  Lin tried reading that to determine what was inside, and
opened it after a that proved to reveal nothing interesting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surprise!&rdquo;  Super special massage coupon, featuring some black boxes
next to the names of the months.  She parsed it as I realized there
was nothing keeping her from drawing more squares on the thing..  and
then she was like, &ldquo;hey wait a minute! How long is the massage?  The
ones Travis gets for Yumi say how long the massage will be!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;one minute each!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What??&rdquo;</p>

<p>I ended the conversation by putting the bear bag in her lap.  She saw
the shop branding and was like, &ldquo;yay!!&rdquo; and hugged it.</p>

social media.</p>

<p>So yeah, good times!</p>
