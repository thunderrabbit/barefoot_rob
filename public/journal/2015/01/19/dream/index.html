<div class="dream">
Fred and I were going opposite directions on the
train between Shibuya and Ebisu; I got on the train as he got off.  We
waved to each other, doing huge waves so we could see each other even
as the train was fully outside the station; I was running back and
forth along the seats as my wave so he could see the motion, and I
could see he was doing something equally wavy and we could see each
other all the way until I arrived at Shibuya station where I realized
I was walking in my underwear, but holding a briefcase through the
area and then walking toward the train station, some guys were like,
"woo woo look at this!" and I go, "sometimes I wear evn less!" and
flashed my butt at them as I walked down the stairs to the
station. The train was a shinkansen, arriving on the platform and then
correcting itself and going down on to the tracks, but somepeople had
to scramble a bit to get out of its way.  I walked past some group of
youth and they were like, "hey!" and said "and an ice cream for the
barefoot guy" and a girl with bright red coat pulled me toward the ice
cream stand with their group.

They were talking about church and I was like, "bah i'm not joining
any church" etc and as I began to rail on religion, I started to wake
up from the dream, </div>

<p>so I realized it was noisy brain activity that was waking me and I
shut that down and allowed myself back into dreamland</p>

<div class="dream"> I offered to go to church with them. and we were
in rows and they started a prayer in unison to "Doctor Oregon" (I
think) and I had my own prayer to him: "Doctor Oregon, I invite you to
show yourself and guide me in ever-loving and mutually beneficial ways
for the highest good" or something and I was talking to the group
again after that.

</div>

<p>but I don&rsquo;t really remember what we said.  I woke up soon thereafter.</p>
