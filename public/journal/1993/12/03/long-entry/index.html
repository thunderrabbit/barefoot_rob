                        <p class="note">(transcribed from Book Six 1:54pm JST Sunday 28 June 2009 (day 14340))</p>

<p class="date">7:50PM Friday 3 December 1993 Day (Page44)</p>

<p>I have decided to not keep track of exactly what day I'm on each day.  I'll keep this pointer
back to page 44 that will tell me the last recorded day count so I can recalculate it.  The only
reason for this is that maybe the days will go by faster, not that they are going slowly now.
Heck, I don't know.</p>

<p>Wednesday after database lab ended at 6pm <del>we crui</del> I cruised to the VAX to work.
Maggie was there fucking around while John did his program.  Dave Psurney (also in database) &amp;
Steve Inman (database) &amp; I were working on SQL. Stupid fucker Hassan started SQL that night.
he hadn't attended class in weeks.  Dumb ass.</p>

<p>At 6PM Dave &amp; I were like, &quot;ok we have 18 hours.&quot; It felt like barely plenty of
time.  We worked &amp; worked &amp; I was hungry.  Maggie &amp; John cruised at 10pm &amp; brought
me 6 McDonald's hamburgers &amp; a shake.  I ate two of them immediately.</p>

<p>The VAX was incredibly slow as I was compiling my Pro*Pascal program at 10PM.  14 hours left.  I
called Heather &amp; told her I didn't know if I would be able to tutor her at 10:30AM I called
&amp; told Tanya I definitely could not type her gymnastics routine.</p>

<p>Each time I compiled my program it took a long ass time, so I would go back &amp; talk to Katy
(cutie that I met through Caleb) who was playing on a MUD &amp; working on Prob &amp; Stats.  She
cruised &amp; hugged me &amp; at one point had let me bite her (hand) &amp; wrote me a mail
message.</p>

<p>10 hours left.  Things looked bleak.  I called Heather &amp; told her.  Things better start
pulling together soon or I won't be happy.  Steve showed me how to do stuff with dates &amp; how to
put where conditions in cursor queries.  I showed him how to do labels &amp; stuff in Pascal.  He
saved me so much time that my project would have suffered severely.</p>

<p>Dave showed me how to do some shit with the last query - build a temporary table.</p>

<p>Steve cruised at 2am.</p>

<p>&quot;Dude. we have 10 hours left.&quot; &quot;I know.&quot;</p>

<p>Darell Spice left without finishing.</p>

<p>Things started pulling together.  I got all the first 9 queries working.  Then with knowelege [sic]
(sp) about how to build a temporary table I got #10 done.  Bad Ass.</p>

<p>I had finally finished my Pro*Pascal stuff after Steve had showed me the date stuff.</p>

<p>4:30AM. &quot;Dude. it's almost 5 o'clock in the morning.&quot;  &quot;Dude.&quot;  &quot;Dude
the sun is coming up!&quot;  There was a certain red glow outside but it may have just been city
lights.  At 5AM Mark Hartray stumbled in. (My old Poli Sci instructor.  ugh.)  He
looked <em>tired</em>.  heh.</p>

<p>Dave &amp; I were tired but generally optimistic &amp; getting all our stuff printed &amp;
organized &amp; talking the whole time.</p>

<p>AT 5:15 I realized Maggie was awake so I called her.  I told her that I just had one bit more to
do, but I couldn't muster enough to do it.  Sh rallied me but it didn't work.</p>

<p>We printed our stuff and got it all together.</p>

<p>&quot;Dude we've been here 8 hours.  Wait - we've been here wait we've been her [sic] fucking 12
hours.  Holy Shit.&quot;</p>

<p>I cruised and Dave had decided to do some last little stuff.</p>

<p>I ate one of the remaining 2 hamburgers on the way to my house.  I stopped by &amp; checked
everything <ins>&amp; got my key from Suzanne</ins> &amp; then went straight to Maggie's.  Rush
hour traffic was in effect.  I got there at exactly 7 as Maggie predicted &amp; I slept from 7AM to
9:30AM.</p>

<p>I met Heather at school &amp; tutored her &amp; then stayed awake in Graphics.</p>

<p>They are building new doors in PGH.  Dude.  The doors are slightly inside the current doors.</p>

<p>Marcel showed Pieroni his graphics program for 45 minutes &amp; then I typed my gymnastics
routine on his computer.</p>

<p>Christine showed up at gymnastics with a lady named Crystal.</p>

<p>I was the first to do the final routine.  I sat between Heather &amp; Laura to watch the rest.
Chris was really graceful &amp; beautiful.  Andy's was fresh &amp; required strength (which I was
unable to deliver being so tired)</p>

<p>I didn't make my first attempt at press to handstand so I barely made it when i tried again.
When I didn't get all the way to the corner of the floor I started making up shit to get there.
(One arm cartwheel &amp; something else.)  At the corner I had a long pause to make sure I had the
energy to pull of [sic] a round off back flip.  Barely.  So I exerted the hell out of myself to do
it &amp; i got it.  Bad Ass.</p>

<p>After all the routines, it was fuck around time.</p>

<p>I played &amp; talked to Christine &amp; goofed around.  Me Wasseim &amp; Aaron did some fun
trampoline stuff.  The game was to jump over the low uneven bar Then <del>wc</del> we high jumped it
&amp; then we put it on the high uneven bar spot.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/File:Page_50_Book_Six_snippet_3_December_1993.jpg"><img src="/w/images/4/47/Page_50_Book_Six_snippet_3_December_1993.jpg"
alt="springboards, tramp, tramp, highbar"/></a></p>

<p>We had this set up at one point.  We would jump jump jump &amp; fly to the bar and catch it.
Wasseim &amp; I would catch it backwards (I did it first) sometimes.  Cool.</p>

<p>I watched The Muppets Take Manhattan in the Houston Room &amp; <del>some</del> a female behind
me smelled really good but she wasn't exactly gorgeous.</p>

<p>On the way back to the dorms I saw Jessica (from The Hammock) &amp; Chris (SPB) &amp; Dawn
(Fountain) &amp; Elizabeth (Taub) setting up sound equipment by the wading fountain.  The band
didn't exactly show up so it became open mic.</p>

<p>Brad &amp; Fred &amp; I did a <del>barp</del> <del>burping</del> belching contest &amp;
entertained a bit.  Fred &amp; I did the bowling thing - It's been like 6 years since I saw (heard)
that done by Andy in high school.  Dude.  Fred &amp; I had never before gotten the chance to do
it.</p>

<p>Then I sat down by a girl named Amanda -wait.</p>

<p>I lay back on Dawn &amp; told her to bite me &amp; she didn't.  She teased me.  She said
&quot;here?&quot; &quot;it's been a long time since I've bitten anyone.&quot; &lt;Whimper&gt; She
teased me.</p>

<p>Then I sat down by a girl named Amanda who had stopped to listen while walking by.  I talked to
her a bit and asked if she wanted to perform for us.  She didn't but was content to listen.</p>

<p>A dude that just walked by sang &amp; gave us food from some party.  (cookies &amp; chips)</p>

<p>Then after no one was on the mic, I walked slowly up there.  I took the mic &amp; stood silently
for a moment &amp; then began.  I did Bill Cosby stuff - Taking a bath in the toilet - Chris had
the reverb on really loud - about 2 seconds apart for about 5 echoes.  That could be obnoxious, but
it forced me to slow down &amp; let the echo die down before I continued, thus allowing me time to
think &amp; collect my next sentence &amp; made my routine a bit funnier I think.</p>

<p>I also allowed me to hear myself to see how I was doing (well) and gave me confidence (I was
funny!)</p>

<p>I did Bill Cosby's thing on golf, (a stupid game) an a bit from the roadside sign one that Fred
does.</p>

<p>I was funny.  I did Bill Cosby's Fat Albert airplane cessna engine car.  I was funny.  Cool Cool
Cool.</p>

<p>Then the 5 echo long repeat thing made a very cool thing possible.  We had 5 microphones &amp;
people all making little random noises in each one.  Then big noises &amp; phrases &quot;Shut up
Lew!&quot; growls - it was fantastic - I really really wanted to record it - I <del>bit it</del>
bet it could be sold as music. <del>(Not</del> Not a whole CD of that, but a good 10 minutes.
Dawn's voice was beautiful on it - her little sighs &amp; whimpers &amp; moans &amp; hums &amp;
noises for which there is no name were fantastic Enigma type stuff.</p>

<p>We did that for at least an hour.  I really would love a recording of it.</p>

<p>On the way out through Taub, I stopped by Britt's &amp; sat by her on her bed &amp; she was not
pleased with Scott in general, but he was there studying.  She made my day by holding my arm as I
was beside her.  I loved it.</p>

<p>I got to bed Thursday night at about midnight.  So I got 2.5 hours of sleep in 38.75 hours.
Cool.</p>

<p>This morning (Friday) Laura came over at about 7 AM &amp; tried to sleep though she had taken
Vivarin.  I cuddled &amp; smooched on her and stuff.  We did some crotch grinding, but nothing
more.</p>

<p>She cruised &amp; I wrote my report for project 2 Database.  I drove to school specifically to
turn it in &amp; I came back &amp; slept for 3 hours.  Now here I am.</p>

<p>I thought of a funny thing to say on someone's answering machine.  &quot;HI.  This is Rob.  It's
1:27 and I wait it's 1:29 1:30 oh - that's my CD player...&quot;</p>

<p>Check you later.</p>
