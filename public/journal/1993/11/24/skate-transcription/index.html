<p class="note">(transcribed from Book Six 11:02pm JST Friday 26 June 2009 (day 14338))</p>
<p class="note">(actually continued from previous entry in Book Six, with no break in writing)

<p>I went down into the garage under Party on the Plaza with two little dudes and we got busted.
The cops made us take our skates off and walk out.</p>

<p>Then I was screwing around on PotP and going down the steps &amp; stuff and showing off when
groups of parade girls walked by.</p>

<p>I found another group and we cruised to the tunnel that links PotP garage &amp; stuff.  (This is
the tunnel we did when I first went skating.)  It seemed WAY smaller this time.  We got busted.
Shit.  We got all the way to the garage &amp; some cops were there so we bolted back the other
way.  They were telling us to stop but no way.  Then there were guards on the other side and they
got us.  Shit shit shit.  They recognized me and knew but I told them &quot;you said the
garage.&quot; &quot;I didn't even know these were linked...&quot;</p>

<p>5 or 6 guards escorted us to the supervisor dude and he said, &quot;Get them out of here.&quot;
So they just kicked us out and we cruised.  (Had to take our skates off again.)</p>

<p>The other skater dudes cruised so I was hanging out with 6 or 8 Greyhound buses were cruising by
being escorted by cops.  Cool.  So I skated alongside the buses and pretended I was being escorted
too.  I like to think that people on the bus noticed me.  Buses stopped &amp; hundreds &amp;
hundreds of girls poured out.  They all looked to be between 14 &amp; 18 years old.  They  were a
dance group from &quot;all over the place&quot; I talked to a girl with braces; there were a bunch
of them with braces.  I got pictures of them as they were practicing.  There were actually 2 groups
and I met one girl in the second group.  Her name is Gina and she's cute and blonde.</p>

<p>Now - the cheerleaders were UCA staff - the same ones that I met a long ass time ago in may.
There was Devincent &amp; Jim &amp; a dude and that was cool to check them out again.  I got
pictures of a girl being thrown about 40 feet into the air and a picture of 5 girls doing splits
way up in mid air (picture from behind) Cool cool cool.</p>

<p>I also got a picture of Gina's group when they all bent over &amp; all I could see were girls'
butts.  Cool.  I don't know if she is in the picture.</p>

<p>I talked to DeVincent &amp; Jim briefly afterward and they remembered me.  Cool.</p>

<p>I also met a little dude named Bill who will be in a double stunt.</p>

<p>Then I cruised over to where the floats were being set up.  I met Farrah, who will be driving the
first float of the parade.  (The big turkey  I also met a 13 year old cutie named Ann who has
braces.  her whole family is intimately involved with the floats &amp; stuff.  I talked to her
about her favorite float &amp; stuff.  She has braces.  Her favorite is the gorilla.  I took a
picture of it.</p>

<p>Then I found some more dudes and we went skating everywhere.</p>

<p>We did the Exxon garage which is the spiral across the street from YMCA, which I've been wanting
to do for a long time.  It was cool.  It's just a big long right turn slide all the way down.  I
did it without a problem.  We got yelled at on the way out but we cruised.</p>

<p>We did a garage near Passport Photos.  It's 6 stories tall and we just ran up the steps to do
it.  We did it twice.  It has really short steep inclines &amp; then long flat straight parts.  We
didn't get in trouble.</p>

<p>Then we cruised to Jesus Saves.  Dude.  I had never been so I was really glad to do it.  We
cruised into the elevator and people were like &quot;which level?&quot;  There are 13 levels.
Someone said &quot;5.&quot;  Someone said &quot;naw.&quot;  I said &quot;13.&quot;  We cruised to
level 13.  We search a moment for the ramp &amp; then we found it.  People were like pausing at the
top until one dude cruised &amp; so I cruised.</p>

<p>Each ramp goes down two stories.  The ramp part of the ramp has plenty of traction, and the turn
parts have much less traction but enough to scrape a knee as I found out once. It's a fresh garage.
We got to the bottom and were like dude.  Go again.  So we cruised to the elevators and a little
speaker in the wall announced, &quot;You all need to leave the garage.&quot; Dude.  So we
cruised.</p>

<p>We checked out some stuff near the Video Christmas Tree thing and that was cool.  Then we
cruised home.</p>

<p>There was a baster on my counter so I knew someone had been in my apartment.  Molly had left a
turkey in my refrigerator and a note saying Maggie will call me at 6AM to tell me what to do with
it.  Dude.</p>

<p>I showered &amp; here I am.</p>
