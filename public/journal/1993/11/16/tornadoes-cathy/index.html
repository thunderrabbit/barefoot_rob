<p class="note">(transcribed from Book Six 10:50pm JST Saturday 20 June 2009 (day 14332))</p>

<p class="date">1:20AM Wednesday 17 November 1993 (Day 54)</p>

<p>&quot;Today&quot; there were tornadoes &amp; shit downtown &amp; flooding across the city.
Fortunately, none of my shit got fucked up, and most of the rain was over by the time I left.</p>

<p>There was a 30 (thirty) car accident on I45 South <del>toward</del> <ins>near</ins> Galveston.
Fuck.</p>

<p>Maggie &amp; I got pictures of the Enron Building, which lost several windows, and a <del>bill
b</del> billboard that &quot;exploded&quot; according to an eyewitness.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I did not get a picture of Memorial Drive flooded in one ara near Shepherd.</p>

<p>In graphics, the weather got really really dark &amp; windy &amp; rainy again.  Also, I took an
opportunity to insult the guy was is using Visual Baisc to do the graphics project.</p>

<p>Marcel, Molly, Maggie, &amp; I joined Steve for lunch &amp; Katy (cute girl, Caleb's friend, does
lots of e-mail &amp; internet stuff) &amp; Dave (Sabita's boyfriend) joined us.  Cool.  We
talked <del>about</del> sex jokes &amp; computer jokes.</p>

<p>In gymnastics, I spotted Laura doing some cartwheels on the beam.  That was really cool because
she usually seems to never want to interact with me. I enjoyed it.</p>

<p>I straddled my legs around Candy (facing her) &amp; talked to her briefly at the end of
class.</p>

<p>I went to Moly's &amp; when Lisa came in, I told her, &quot;Lisa, I have decided to quit bugging
you.  I will be your friend but I will not try to kiss you anymore.  You are obviously not as
infatuated with me as I am with you.&quot; &quot;I don't know how to respond.&quot;</p>

<p>Molly &amp; I both said, &quot;Just say, 'Thank you.'&quot;  I seriously doubt that I embarassed
her or hurt her pride, but I hope I didn't.</p>

<p>I went to Britt's room and hugged her and she was a bit more huggy than usual.  We talked for 30
minutes and discussed our futures and roller coasters and dolphins.  She is having some trouble
with her relationship with Scott and that was part of the reason she was down, but mostly,
&quot;discontent&quot; with her life in general.  I gave her many hugs to make her feel better.</p>

<p>I got home &amp; was in a big cleaning mood &amp; I cleaned &amp; mostly reorganized my whole
apartment.  I built the plexiglass shelf that's holding my Dr Dobb's magazines.</p>

<p>I got a meeting scheduled for Dr Barth to join the EAG meeting next Monday.</p>

<p>I called Cathy &amp; her sister Linda answered &amp; said they might come over later tonight.
They did.  At midnight, Cathy, Linda &amp; Alex &amp; Vivian came over.  Alex &amp; Vivian cruised
pretty quickly; to my pleasure, Cathy &amp; Linda stayed for a while.  They (Cathy) are great!</p>

<p>Cathy wants a big Rotweiler, they like my music : nin, House of Pain, 10000 maniacs, Siouxie
&amp; the Banshees, Green Jelly, Enya, U2, Cypress Hill, Book of Love ... Bad Ass!</p>

<p>They checked out my graphics project &amp; they were quite impressed &amp; Cathy liked my room
decorations and she wants to put her handprint on the wall as well.  Cool.  <del>Linda</del></p>

<p>Linda asked, &quot;so what else col do you have to show us?&quot; So I showed them my marble
track.  They loved it.  They renamed it my Marble Maze.</p>

<p>I was continually giving Cathy shoulder rubs &amp; back scratch &amp; back rub &amp; at one
point while we were exchanging stories in my dining room, I was standing behind her and she wrapped
my arms around her front as she held my hands.  Wonderful.  Wonderful. Wonderful.  I loved it.</p>

<p>Happily, (except for school &amp; other obligations) they kept delaying their departure as we
talked.  I kept holding Cathy and giving her occasional kisses <del>abov</del> on or above her
ear.</p>

<p>I walked them outside &amp; hugged Cathy on the balcony &amp; at her car.  During our last hug,
she kissed me on the cheek.  I <del>was</del> am ecstatic.  I love it.  I love it.</p>

<p>We will see what happens.</p>
