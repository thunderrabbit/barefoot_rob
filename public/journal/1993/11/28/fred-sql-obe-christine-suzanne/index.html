<p class="note">(transcribed from Book Six 10:58pm JST Saturday 27 June 2009 (day 14339))</p>

<p>I see my hands.  Therefore I am dreaming.</p>

<p class="date"><ins>2:35AM</ins> Monday 29 November 1993 [Day 66]</p>

<p>Friday I picked up dad from the airport and stayed overnight at his house.  Late Friday night
Fred came in and neither dad nor I had seen him in a while so that was cool.</p>

<p>Fred &amp; I played SILVER, a VGA bad ass pinball game for a couple hours.</p>

<p>Then he went to bed &amp; I stayed up till 5AM Saturday morning to beat Fred's score.</p>

<p>Saturday I mostly played around but I also rotated my tires to get my new tires on the front of
the car.  The one on the front right was in really shitty condition.  It's now my spare.</p>

<p>I went home Saturday night with _Journeys Out of the Body_ by Robert A. Monroe.  I read almost
half of it (instead of doing SQL) and I ended up quite scared out of my wits.  So I called Forest
&amp; talked to him for a while until I calmed down to sleep.</p>

<p>&quot;Today&quot; I woke up &amp; worked on SQL a teensy bit &amp; then I went to Molly's room
and worked more.</p>

<p>Then everyone but I left and I got some good work done on Automata.</p>

<p>Then Christine called &amp; said that she &amp; Suzanne had brought food to Social Work for me.
Excellent!  So I cruised over there to eat.</p>

<p>I played with them - tickle fought &amp; talked about Out of Body Experiences (OOBE) &amp;
Suzanne has done it once &amp; Christine has almost done it but she got scared.</p>

<p>I walked them to Suzanne's car &amp; flirted with them out there.  I was getting too horny for
Christine to keep me happy so I cruised.</p>

<p>I worked on SQL at Social Work till midnight when they closed.  I walked with Shama (originally
3rd Taub now 1st Taub) outside &amp; rode with her security escort to Taub.</p>

<p>Molly &amp; Sabita &amp; Will were outside checking out the lunar eclipse.</p>

<p>We watched then I cruised.</p>

<p>I went to Suzanne's &amp; explained my no sex rules &amp; stuff &amp; now here I am about to see
my hands therefore I am dreaming.</p>
