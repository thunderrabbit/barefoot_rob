<p class="note">(transcribed from Book Six 4:34pm JST Friday 26 June 2009 (day 14338))</p>

<p class="date">1:10 AM Tuesday 23 November 1993 (Day 60)</p>

<p>&quot;Today&quot; my car stalled on the I-10 feeder in the right turn lane to turn onto
Silber.</p>

<p>I alone pushed it around the corner &amp; up over the railroad tracks while barefoot.  It was
quite a challenge. It wouldn't start until I propped open the butterfly valve on the carburetor.</p>

<p>Maggie &amp; I watched the Simpsons that she had recorded.  I had seen it.</p>

<p>Automata sucked.</p>

<p>Today I wore long pants because I figured it would be cold.  It was beautiful sunny but it got
cold when it got dark.</p>

<p>EAG meeting with Stephen Barth was today.  I had never met him before.  We figured out how to
volunteer for buildings &amp; stuff, and brainstormed on what to do in the future.</p>

<p>After he cruised, Shenan requested a title within the group so she took Geoff's title of vice
president.  I got a title.  Now I'm the Recycling Chair of EAG.  Bad Ass.</p>

<p>At one point Shenan was talking &amp; I was getting up or something and she said, &quot;Sit
down,&quot; in a false grouchy voice.  So, I moved my chair right beside hers &amp; sat down right
beside her.  Touching her - shoulder to shoulder.  She smiled, &quot;smart ass.&quot;  At one point
as she was talking I flirtatiously banged my knee against hers &amp; she banged back.  Cool.  She
is really a babe.</p>

<p>I think I should try to be friends with her in the same way that I became friends with Laura
W.</p>

<p>Database sucked.. Near the end of lecture I woke up and someone had written WAKE UP really big
on my paper.  Heh.  I love it.</p>

<p>Lab was okay.  I flirted with Eva but I think she didn't take it as flirting, but just put up
with it as an annoyance.</p>

<p>I'm getting this SQL shit figured out.</p>

<p>Me, Molly, Maggie, Will, John &amp; Lisa ate at the Towers.  I had the guy blop a big blop of
sloppy joe meat on my pizza so I could smuggle it out.  That was a significant amount of extra
food.</p>

<p>Lisa had 3 bites off my ice cream bar.  yum.</p>

<p>At home I did some SQL Plus &amp; put some tables &amp; data in my thing.</p>

<p>I tutored Heather &amp; got 11 bucks.</p>

<p>I called Cathy &amp; chatted just for a bit.</p>

<p>Shama called &amp; I named an SQL hotel after her.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>
