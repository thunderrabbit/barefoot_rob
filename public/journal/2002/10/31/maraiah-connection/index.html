<p>Recently Maraiah sent me a reverse survey, where we tell what we
know about the other person.  I don't know a lot about her really, but
for the record, this is what I wrote:</p>

<p>I replied to her reply, which I found quite flattering.  There's a
part of me interested in hooking up with her, but I've intentionally
tossed _____'s name in there to keep that from happening.</p>

HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW ME?


1. My name: Rob 'The Bod' Nugen

:-)

2. Where did we meet?  Outside Taub--you walked me to
my car

Oh yeah; I might remember that.  I have a memory that says you knew I was safe because Sarah liked me, or something like that.

3. Take a stab at my middle name: Eunice? 

Close!

Wow! 11 years

Wow

5. How well do you know me?
Not biblically...(not technically)

Abusing your body

?

I jokingly gave a list to you; I actually know of no bad habits that you have.

Benevolent, not the Old Testament

basically correct.   (Who/what/why is God is one of my favorite discussions, if you want to get into such a conversation with me)

"Where the hell are his shoes?!"

:-)

Too dazzled by your SMILE to notice ;^)

brown / hazel

Awwwwwwwww!  thanks!!  :-)

4 years younger brother named Fred

13. What do I want to be (if I grow up)?
Grow up?! Never!

mu wah hahahaha

14. What's one of my favorite things to do?

16. What is my best feature?
Your *endurance*

*wagging tail* thanks!


17. Five words to describe me: (Shy, outgoing, etc.)
Refreshing, fun, sexy, patient, genuine

:-)

18. Do I have any special talents?
Finding wonder in the little things...

I try hard to do this often.

19. What is your clearest memory of me?
I have two actually: 1) walking across campus one
evening.  We ended up on the HUGE hammock, talking
'til late. 2) DEFINITELY the phone call

Oh my gosh; I totally loved that big hammock!  I slept on that hammock
one night from like 10pm to 7am.  It was basically comfortable, but I
woke up a lot throughout the night to make sure I was okay.

I think I remember hanging out with you there..  Was that on the way
back to the dorms that we stopped there?  I have a sense that we
walked toward the UC, then around the engineering building, then back
through to the hammock.

20. Have you ever seen me cry?
No, I'll settle for 'crying out'

As in needing a friend?  Or in a lust-filled orgasmic way?

21. If you could give me a nickname, what would it be?
Iron Man

You're too kind.

22. Have I ever been in love? 
Yes

yes.  Currently I'm in love with _____ in California.

23. When was the last time we spent time together?
Wow? That long?

It's been a few days..

24. What's my favorite color?
Sunshine yellow

bright primary colors

25. If, in one hour, I'd be gone forever... what would
you say to me now? 

You blow my mind.
Not just the phone call--although that was
*amazing*--but your unique perspective of the world.
The way you live in each moment. Cherish every
sensation. Cultivate friends.

I strive to live half as well as you.  Thank you for
sharing a portion of yourself with me.

I've always been a bit intimidated by you - the way I see you working
hard to get what you want professionally (I remember you working super
lots in security somehow; and really having a plan for your life.
That always impressed me) and having high standards in men.  (I can
imagine you laughing at that, but .. yeah.  I remember you like(d) men
in uniform, such as cops, and I was all, "oooh cops are tough," so I
never tried to compete.  Plus; I wear, let's say... not uniforms.
Still shorts and T-shirts as much as possible, though I'll have to
wear suits at work in Japan) That intimidation has worn off as I have
my own source for inner self-worth, but since you and I haven't hung
out all that much, there is still a memory of that intimidation which
I remember a lot when thinking of you.

I'm thankful for your tight friendship with Sarah; otherwise I would
have lost track of you.

When you have time, I'd be interested to know what's up with you.  We
can plan for a long phone call if you'd prefer.  I'm at 555-555-9555,
which is not *my* number, but the number of the house at which I'm
staying in Dallas until I fly off to Japan next year.

I lost my computer job in June cause we weren't making enough money to
afford everyone, and they knew I was planning to go teach English in
Japan next year so they were all, "we hate to let you go, but blah
blah" and I was all, "WHOOOHOOOOOOOO!!!" and ran out the door and got
rid of my stuff (like all my furniture and my beloved cat (I cried a
*lot* for that) and my apartment) and left Houston.

Got into a fucked up situation involving a pregnancy, and fortunately
for me also involving a miscarriage.  That has taught me to be *way*
more careful in my little adventure here.

I took a 3700 mile roadtrip from Dallas -> OKC -> Tulsa -> Hot
Springs, AR -> Memphis, TN -> Barboursville, WV -> Columbus, OH ->
Oberlin, OH -> Kalamazoo, MI -> Chicago -> Bloomington, IL ->
Columbia, MO -> Springfiled, MO -> Tulsa -> Dallas, to see friends and
family in the US before I zip over to Japan next year.

I'll take a western state trek starting in mid November after I work
some, and attend some church related conferences in the next couple
weeks.

- - - -

I'm intrigued by you striving to live half as well as me..  You must
mean that I live spiritually well or some such, because physically I
live like a pauper or a bum or something.  I've had to give up a lot
to live this way.

I once asked a man how to take an amazing trek like the one I took
recently.  He said simply, "begin to plan it."

    With Love Always
    - Rob
