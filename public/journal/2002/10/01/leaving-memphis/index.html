                        <p class=date>12:18pm CDT Tuesday 1 October 2002</p>

<p>I've had so so so so so much fun here in Memphis, from trampoline
to hot tub, concrete wall balancing to Southpark, Amelie to Sliding
Doors, rabbit to dog to cats to cat burglar.</p>

<p>I'm leaving today; I think I have all my stuff out of the house; I
don't know exactly where I'm going next.</p>

<p class=date>12:44pm</p>

<p>Okay.  This part of the trip may be the Kinko's Tour.  From a
Kinko's in Memphis I just found a Kinko's location in Nashville, right
off I-40.  That's where I'll go next.  Not sure how far it is to
there.</p>

<p class=date>12:53pm</p>

<p>$1.359/gallon for gas.  996.9 mile traveled since Dallas.</p>

<p class=date>2:25pm</p>

<p>Chillin' at a parking area now.  Been listening to my Eminem mix
tape that Janette got for me.</p>

<p>About 108 miles from Nashville now I think.  90 miles traveled so
far today.</p>

<p class=date>2:44pm</p>

<p>Okay.  I just caught up on livejournal.  Not so impressed with how
Calder quit work, but it's a pretty surprising story.  Annie's entry
had something funny in it that I forgot, and I hope Colleen finds
balance, and all the rest of my peeps as well.</p>

<p class=date>3:14pm</p>

<p>Woah.</p>

<p>I got an email today from Jimmy who paid for me-an-Tanner's lunch
on my last day or so in Tulsa.  When he wrote me, I hadn't written
about it on my site (unless he's just silly and couldn't find it), but
I'll look when I get to Kinko's in Nashville and write it if it's not
there.</p>

<p>I'm at a rest area on I-40.  I stopped because I had been wracking
my brain to figure out who had written me the email and then I finally
figured it out so I stopped driving.</p>

<p class=date>3:47pm</p>

<p>HAhaHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA 56.5 miles west of Nashville I just passed by
an exit for Bucksnort..  <em>Bucksnort!!</em> I probably shouldn't
drive with my knee and type at 65 miles per hour, but there's not much
traffic.  Plus..  Bucksnort!!!!</p>

<p class=date>4:48pm</p>

<p>Traffic in Memphis now.</p>

<p class=date>5:11pm</p>

<p>Made it to the Kinko's in Nashville that I had targeted from the
Kinko's in Memphis.  Let's see where to next..</p>

<p>Um, the restroom.</p>

<p class=date>5:34pm</p>

<p>Okay, weird, but whatever.  This Kinko's doesn't have ethernet
access; only dial-up is available.  They allow first 30 minutes free
and then $12/hour after that.  I talked the guy into giving me free
access to their computers.</p>

<p>So, after traveling east on I-40 for 200+ miles, my next plan is to
travel east on I-40 for 200+ miles.  Way exciting!</p>

<p>not.</p>

<p>But hey it's been fun to drive from overcast not quite flat Memphis
to drizzly foggy not quite mountainous Nashville.  Plus I got to see a
sign for Bucksnort!  And some signs for Loretta Lynn's restaurant.  Oh
yeah I'm sure she's in the back cookin' up eggs or serving them.
Better go there quick to see her!</p>

<p class=date>5:59pm</p>

<p>Got some gallons of gas for $1.289 per gallon.  210 miles driven
today so far.</p>

<p>Oh, and I noticed a greater percentage of women with lots of makeup
on.</p>

<p class=date>7:05pm</p>

<p>Raining pretty effectively now.  It's not a cold rain, but
definitely wet and not too warm.  I'm at a rest area and have just
slid all the way down the pebble sidewalk on my Adidas sandals.  Not
in one slide, but yeah.</p>

<p>While in the rest area, I overheard a woman ask for a nearby
campground.  It's apparently $12 or $13 per night, but I will probably
just sleep a few hours and not even really get out of my car.</p>

<p class=date>7:35pm</p>

<p>Well, it quit raining and I'm glad for that.  Super hilly and dark
and damp and foggy getting to this camp place.  I'm parked at the
laundry room area, and I'm not sure if cars are supposed to park on
these wooden decks off the road, but it sure does look that way.
Wednesdays are free to use the facilities.  I did go through a gate
that could be closed (at 10:30 pm?) so I hope it's not when I want to
leave.</p>

<p>Potty now and then sleep.</p>

<p class=date>9:48pm</p>

<p>Yahaa!  Awake and now go.</p>

<p class=date>10:02pm</p>

<p>Made it past the gates and now I'm out of the park area.  Thank you
Edgar Evins State Park!</p>

<p class=date>12:54am CDT Wednesday 2 October 2002</p>

<p>I drove past Knoxville and didn't know it because I was talking to
Wende.  I did notice a city, but didn't realize it was the city I had
been looking for until I noticed no more signs indicating how far away
it was.  Now I'm in a Holiday Inn looking for internet access to look
up a Kinko's.  I tried a Super 8 first, but they had no internet
access at all.</p>

<p>Fun names that I've passed that I remember:</p>

<p>Pigeon Forge
<br>Douglas Dam</p>

<p>There was another but I don't remember it now.</p>

<p>I've driven around 400 miles today.</p>

<p class=date>1:11am</p>

<p>440 miles.  I didn't find internet access at Holiday Inn either,
nor even an employee at the desk.  So I'm just parked in the back to
take a nap.</p>

<p class=date>5:47am CDT Wednesday 2 October 2002</p>

<p>Awake.  Talking to my dad to get phone numbers of his fam to see
where I'm going to stay next.</p>

<p class=date>5:56am</p>

<p>Gottem.  Thanks so much, dad!  My phone charger is worth the $5 I
paid for it; I'm using yarn from the Tulsa Rally worship to hold it
securely in place on my phone so it will charge.</p>

<p class=date>6:01am</p>

<p>Just talked to Becky (my dad's younger sister); now I know where to
go: Barbersville.</p>

<p>Sure is foggy outside.</p>

<p class=date>6:46am</p>

<p>Adding to the list of fun city names: Jonesborough (sister city to
Jonesboro AR of course)</p>

<p>I'm wearing sweat pants and my hoodie now. I seem to have left my
jacket in Memphis.</p>

<p class=date>8:08am</p>

<p>100+ miles driven today.  550 miles since Memphis.  Just passed an
exit for Saltville, VA, certainly a sister city to Sugarland, TX.</p>

<p class=date>8:36am</p>

<p>Just stopped to P and get a few gallons of gas at $1.299.  571
miles since Memphis.  Sweat pants and hoodie off and into the back
seat.</p>

<p class=date>8:43am</p>

<p>Big hills mostly coated in trees, looking like a model railroad
mountain covered in lumps of shades of green.  Rocky outcroppings form
a wall on either side of the highway unless I'm driving by a big
valley looking over a grassy tree coated plain.  No flat ground here.
Sky is mostly cloudy with bits of sun peeping through.  Sometimes in
the median of the freeway a blanket of white, pink, purple flowers
decorate the ground.  Nice.</p>

<p>Groseclose is the next winner of the funny names contest!</p>

<p class=date>9:06am</p>

<p>Dammit I just stabbed my straw into a red Gatorade juice box,
slurped a few slurps and then for fun blew into the straw, inflating
the box and then it squirted juice out the straw onto my shirt and
shorts!  D'oh!  and Hahah that's pretty funny in a not so funny way.
At least it's a dark shirt.  Not that I won't wear a well stained
shirt.</p>

<p class=date>9:13am</p>

<p>Turned north on I-77, went up a big hill and then through a
<em>tunnel</em> through a mountain!  Wow!!  Now truly we just went
under the "top" of the mountain, about a mile or a tad less of actual
tunnel.  Wow.  I think it's so exciting to me because I remember being
amazed and impressed to go through tunnels (that same one??)</p>

<p class=date>9:29am</p>

<p>Another tunnnel!!  "East River Mountain"</p>

<p class=date>10:55am</p>

<p>Okay mr tollman I'm out of money!  Since I got on highway 77, three
times $1.25, incuding two Sacajawea dollars and the dollar that
Janette gave me in my box o' goodies.</p>

<p class=date>11:36am</p>

<p>310 miles today; 754 since Memphis.  Eminem blasting.  I can rap
part of some of the songs.  I forget which ones.  I'm tired.  Stopped
at a rest area now.</p>

<p>I grabbed two more Sacajawea dollars out of the zipper bag on my
bike in case this damn tollway never ends.</p>

<p>At the rest area, they have free maps and a brochure from a glass
blowing company, which made me think of Hillary.</p>

<p class=date>1:03pm</p>

<p>Have arrived at Barboursville about 20 minutes ago.  Yikes.  What a
small town.  Half of the people I see know half of the people they
see.  One makeup girl in a small Camaro type car looking depressed in
the passenger's seat, didn't even look up when her boyfriend got in
the car.  Barely looked up when they drove off with another sporty car
with huge engine.  High school age or so.</p>

<p>One girl behind the counter at this BP is <em>so thin</em> that I
immediately think she's anorexic.  She has eyebrow piercings and long
sleeve everything.  Doesn't make eye contact with me as I walk up to
the counter, even to see if I need help. (I didn't, I just wanted to
see how thin she was.  wow.  please eat something.)</p>

<p>Called Becky who should be here soon.</p>
