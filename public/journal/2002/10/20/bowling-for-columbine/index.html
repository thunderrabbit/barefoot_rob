                        <p><b>Bowling for Columbine</b></p>

<p>Full Price Feature</p>

<p>Number one - with a bullet!  If you don&rsquo;t know, this is Michael
Moore&rsquo;s latest documentary, this time about the culture of violence
in America, especially as per gun killing.  Some terrifying
statistics are reported in this film; I wish I could have recorded it
to a hard disc in my head to give myself facts on hand for future
discussion.  It is not a personal paean of self-aggrandizement as
some have suspected; C-Span has conditioned us to expect nothing but
that.</p>

<p>Regardless whether you agree with his message or not, Moore&rsquo;s gifts
as a filmmaker cannot be denied.  His editing and contrasting of
footage and audio tell a greater story than the individual bytes
being parsed.  Shrewd editing wrings the most content from his quiet,
laissez-faire interview style. Moore lets them do all the talking -
it seems as though he must be leading their answers because, well,
how can people be so foolish as to spout off in a way that so clearly
illustrates how dangerous/wrong/deceptive they are?  People do.</p>

<p>He manages to infuse this carnival of horrors with enough humor
laughter obscured dialogue.  The laughter in my audience was from
their delight, watching his subjects shoot themselves in the foot, as
it were.  He asks the right questions, and they are questions that
need asking, need asking in a public forum, and the very absence of
coherent answers is chilling enough.  His regular guy manner and
Hollywood influence get him meetings with barflies and movie stars,
for great juxtaposition.</p>

<p>I know many of us feel the same way about our society but have been
unable to verbalize it.  It may be too simplistic to say that our
culture is the way it is due to one thing or another; no doubt it is
a complex web of many things.  But few have addressed this angle of
the issue, and it needs addressing. If it is one-sided, it is
certainly the side we don&rsquo;t see, unless we listen between the lines
on NPR or hang out with Noam Chomsky.</p>

<p>Why is our gun murder rate 100-300 times greater than in any other
country in the world?  Why are we so quick to send troops, deploy
ships, whip out a shotgun and yell &ldquo;Get off my lawn?&rdquo; We can shoot
each other because we are completely detached from a sense of
community, interrelation, interdependence.  Other industrialized (not
just Western) countries enjoy the same supposedly inappropriate
stimulus as us, have guns, have corrupt leaders, have &ldquo;mixed
ethnicities&rdquo; in their cities, what is the difference?</p>

<p>It is attitudes, fear, misinformation, a self-centered, consumer
culture.  We&rsquo;ve heard this, as an explanation as to why &ldquo;they&rdquo; hate
us, but we are surrounded by enough self-induced terror, who needs
zealots making a move in our direction.  It&rsquo;s a sobering movie, but
very well-stated.</p>

<p>Canada - we joke it&rsquo;s the largest of our 51 states, but no one there
is denied medical care all (&ldquo;it&rsquo;s a basic human right,&rdquo; scoffs an
Ontario teen), there are 7 million guns in 10 million households, yet
less than 40 gun deaths a year.  The US has over 11,000 gun deaths a
year, many uninsured persons.  AND they are legalizing pot.  Why do
we make fun of Canada again?</p>

<p>There are so many beautiful, unspoken moments in Bowling.  I wish I
could spoil some of it for you but you will just have to go see it.
Moore quotes the social commentary as hilariously propagandized by
South Park the movie, a keen social commentary on blame and social
responsibility, worthy of the same audience Moore carries.  Truth
hurts, even when you can laugh at it.</p>

<p>It is also delicious to hear how irrational and crazy the government
officials sound, blaming Marilyn Manson for the crazy teens (but not
Eminem?  Explain that), yet the Artist Formerly Known As Brian had
some very wise things to say.  Also, there is a brilliant animated
short in the middle of the film which I wish was available for
download - it&rsquo;s a fantastic miniature summary of Moore&rsquo;s thesis.</p>

<p>If you recall in the 1980&rsquo;s, there were picket lines around the
theatres playing a little movie that dared to show the human side of
Jesus&rsquo; man/god nature.  People who had not seen the film picketed it,
reviled it, and claimed its one-sidedness was sinful.  One must see
both sides of any major debate, and that film operated under the
premise that plenty has been done with Jesus&rsquo; God-side.  Moore&rsquo;s film
is the Last Temptation of Charleton.  The people who most need to see
it won&rsquo;t, and I wish I could change that - I hope my readers who see
it will help as well.  Roger Ebert yapped at some length about
Moore&rsquo;s excessive use of &ldquo;theatre.&rdquo;  Without the organized
presentation, the public embarrassment of the guilty, the message
would not be heard.  World famous improviser Keith Johnston says that
we go to the theatre to see people change.  We watch Michael Moore
hoping for this change.  Keep the theatre, Mike, it is what makes
your message both understandable and heard.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m going to get loads of disgruntled email from my readers,
who do not have to agree with me, but I hope they will see the film
and argue with me intelligently.  Better yet, see the film, and
challenge someone you can speak to in person to see it as well and
discuss it with them.  I am here to recommend (or not) films, and all
politics aside, this is a fantastically made film.</p>
