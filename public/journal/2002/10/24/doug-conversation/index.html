                        <p class=date>10:34am CDT Thursday 24 October 2002</p>

<p>I have just called Doug and scheduled a talk with him at 1:pm
ish.</p>

<p>yammering about japan</p>

<p>there are adults in the district who think it&rsquo;s time for you to move on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;yeah well fuck them&rdquo; I&rsquo;m thinking.</p>

<p>Gail didn&rsquo;t know about dedication to me so maybe it&rsquo;s not a done deal</p>

<p>he&rsquo;s repeating a story about about japan that he already told me.</p>

<p>re directors at plano</p>

<p>liability issues for someone not involved as a regular advisor</p>

<p>so the fact that I&rsquo;ve been an advisor for 6 years means nothing?</p>

<p>they think I am getting my socialization from YRUU.</p>

<p>I told him about my men&rsquo;s group</p>

<p>Because I&rsquo;m single and 32 and playing with the youth</p>

<p>If you were someone in my congregation, I would tell you to move on.
and I know that&rsquo;s hard to hear.</p>

<p>The potenetial liability issue if someone says something.</p>

<p>I would urge you to think carefully about it.</p>

<p>I can understand that you&rsquo;re angry; I would be pissed.</p>

<p>I explained my quandry; I can either not go to the rally and lie to
my youth about why.  They know my schedule and my priorities.  They
know I wouldn't let anything get in the way.  Except maybe my own
death.  If anyone else dies, fuck them, they'll still be dead after
the rally.</p>

<p>I pointed out that none of the reasons he told me not to go include
that it would be better for the youth if I don't go.  None.  All of
them were based on my safety and covering my ass.</p>

<p>He appreciated that I listened to him and appear to be taking his
advice into consideration.  He also suggested that I talk to other
adults to get input from them.</p>
