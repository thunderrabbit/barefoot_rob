Subject: Dear Representatives,</p>

<p>Greetings!</p>

<p>As one currently represented by one of you, and formerly represented by the
other (ex-Austin, now San Diego) I beseech you both to help stop the madness
happening in our government.  I don&rsquo;t know if it will mean whispering in the
bathroom like junior high conspirators or standing in defiance of the
Speaker&rsquo;s gavel proclaiming a readjustment of priorities, but what is
happening is so blatantly wrong so clearly and horrifyingly foolish, and yet
it seems like no one is even trying to stop it.  I am not saying you are
inactive, far from it!</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s no secret that what Bush wants Congress to approve defies the whole
structure of the three levels of government that we all learn in what, 6th
grade, that he has been tearing little pieces from the Constitution, and
being loud and pushy about this at election time and to distract from his
equally horrifying CEO/economic situations and healh care and Social
Security and stem cell research and all the things he has swept under the
rug.  It is so obvious that he is not just wagging the dog, but has it
gripped by the tail and it swinging at anyone who comes near him, stomping
his indignant, draft-dodging little feet and saying &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m President,
that&rsquo;s why!&rdquo; but the American people are too easily suckered.  We are soft,
complacent, lazy, self-involved, too busy, too poor, too whatever to be able
to stand up and demand better.  We didn&rsquo;t even elect him for Pete&rsquo;s sake!</p>

<p>Sorry.  Listening to the news is like being in the back seat of a car being
drive wildly, recklessly, by a drunk teenager with a deathwish (one of the
Bush girls comes to mind) and all I can do is scream &ldquo;don&rsquo;t go over that
cliff&rdquo; but I am powerless to prevent it.</p>

<p>Please tell your fellow representatives and the candidates who might replace
some of you that they need to listen to the terror, read CounterPunch and
the NY Times and listen to NPR, hear what is happening out in their
constituencies, and stand up, in defiance of the Speaker, and stop the
madness.  I apologize for taking up so much of your valuable time, but I
cannot do more than spread the word.</p>

<p>Best regards,</p>

<p>Karina Montgomery</p>
