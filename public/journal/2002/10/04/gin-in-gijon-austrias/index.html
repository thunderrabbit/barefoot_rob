subj: Gin in Gijón, Asturias

Cheers!  This e-mail thing is so groovy!   I got mail again, and I
want to read them all 5 times!  I have finally arrived to the
Cantabric Sea, my first beach last night, the ®playa de espaÒa®. 
Yesterday while walking from a mountain road, i was routed onto the
highway.  After all, the ¥Camino de Santiago¥ is one of the more
ancient roads in Europe, of course it is a highway now.  When I got to
town this morning I confirmed the news with 10 government agencies
that this is it, no foot trails or farm roads.  I was ready for an
easy road, one with walking paths and blue signs with painted yellow
shells on them indicating the camino.  The ¥camino¥ and life are
becoming more synonymous every step.  I lasted about 2 miles on the
highway yesterday before sliding into a bar and drinking a couple of
spiked coffees with cream. 

      There was an 88 year old guy there with crutches behind his
chair.  During the civil war of Spain (officially 1936-1939, but
starting back around ¥32)  his legs were frostbitten. He lived
outside, fighting, for six years.  We talked for several hours. I had
been slightly shaken up after a few close calls with cargo trucks out
on the road.   My plan was not to get back on the highway.    There is
something about talking with a war survivor, (one of several elderly
men i have talked to this week that survived the war by fighting on
both sides at one time or another during that war- that resulted in
Franco's dictatorship from 1939 to his death in 1974) that reminds me
that the urban assault vehicles that pass me like rockets are not the
worst dangers in life.  After talks of history and family and now i
asked him if i could get to where i am now (GijÛn) from that road side
bar without getting back on the highway.  Ten other people had told me
¥no, impossible...¥. Without pointing out the obvious, that the 10
mile trip would be converted into a 20 mile trip, he gave me detailed
instructions of how to get here.  What a gem!  I usually don't take
pictures of those i find the most precious, i don't know why, but i
got a picture of him and bought him a shot of brandy for today.

      On my little ¥credencial¥ of the ¥Camino¥, that if i was
visiting churches or hostels, would be full of stamps recording the
name and the date of my visit to those places, is a map of the various
¥caminos to Santiago de Compostela¥.  From here it says 351
kilometers.  Then to Finisterre, at least another 100.  My father
reminded me when i spoke with him the other day that i have been as
far as Dallas from San Antonio (Texas) for a month.  Inching my way
across my map, with a deadline in mind, is such a silly sensation.  In
Holland i will be, October 24, if I have reached Finisterre or not. 
So, the news of today, that the 351 plus kilometers is still entirely
more than that due to my alternative route search was taken  with a
contemplative dose of cheese cake.  I have to laugh, because i have
been on the same ¥lost path¥ since the day i left from Le Mont
St. Michelle in Normandy.  The priest there looked at me like i was
insane, with the similar tone of the woman in the tourist office
today, and said, ®there is no foot path to Santiago from here®.  My
motto has become, ®if i don't get lost at least once a day, there is
no adventure®. This helps me through the moments a few kilometers down
a dead-end mountain path, when i know i must turn back, possibly for
the second or third time.  So even thought the clock is ticking again,
there is no use in ruffling my feathers.  Feather ruffling is only
effective when there are witnesses anyway.  As i learned on the
mountain, to not be happy is not to be unhappy.  Emotions are the
costume in front of the act, when there is no stage and no audience,
there is no one to care if i am naked or in a dress. There is no use
in wasting valuable energy on being dramatic if there is no one there
to spend it on.  Ecstasy with an aire of placidity is how i find my
way. I talk to most of the people i meet with the pretense of asking
for directions. I if had found the ¥easy road¥, i might not have stuck
with it for long anyway. 

    Now that i am back at the ocean, i will wander on the beach roads,
listening to the roar of the sea, peaking out on the cliffs and rocks
with an occasional white sand beach i could practice head standing
on.  I think the group i left Roncevalles with, on the main French
route of the ®camino®are getting there today, or this week, they might
be home already.  It will not hurt my feelings if i never get to
Finisterre, always setting out on the ¥camino¥, without a map or
agenda.  I am there already, just where i set out to be. 

       I was finally being a bit religious...about journaling in my
little sparkle book.  Then I found myself in the Pecos of Europe. 
Those mountains made me want to scream.  So beyond comment that my
little daily logs with little bitty words lost me.  I scaled one of
the canyons, 1200 meters (in the wildest parts of the Pyrenees would
have taken 4 hours),  that took me 8 hours!  Verticalisimo!  It has
been the finest weather of the year in these weeks, the whole time i
was in the ¥Peaks¥ (an understatement) not a drop fell from the sky. 
Thank you for your angels!     My favorite pilgrims wish of the week i
will borrow...®That you not get tired and continue happily®  (No te
canses y que sigas feliz hasta que llegues).

      Until always and always... love and liberty... go beyond, gin
