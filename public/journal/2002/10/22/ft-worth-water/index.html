<p>Janette and I just played around a park for about an hour; she is
so much fun!  We got some barbecue sandwich and banana pudding from an
inexpensive small restaurant with outgoing friendly woman behind the
counter who said I ought not climb on the statue of a bull out front,
for the artist might come and take me away in irons.</p>

<p>Janette got a picture of me nose to nose with the bull.  I had to
look up for this; it was a tall bull.</p>

<p>The park beckoned for we couldn't find the art museum.  Climbed
across a bayou on large rocks designed for that purpose.  Blocked the
water between the rocks as best I could to recreate the flooding Lisa
and I did in Memphis.  Not as spectacular for there were 20 other
rocks between which the water could flow.</p>

<p>Climbed a set of stairs leading up to a roadway about 40 feet up.
I was surprised to find no fence or railing keeping me from climbing
up the outside of the steps.  I straddled the handrail as I climbed up
(left leg on the inside where legs belong and right leg on the outside
where birds belong)</p>

<p>Got partway up and was thrilled to see that I could climb into the
support structures underneath the bridge!!!  So simple and begging to
be climbed, I was amazed there was no graffiti all over the underside
there.  I climbed around to various spots under the bridge and Janette
took pictures.</p>

<p>Walked around some miniature park railroad tracks while Janette
giggled as I recited Sir Mix-A-Lot's "Baby Got Back."  She's funny
funny funny.</p>

<p>Saw a cat out by a concrete picnic table, just chilling, and then
we saw two more cats beyond him.  Then we saw a cat bringing food over
to the cats.  I was surprised that he left plates on the ground with
the cats as he walked back to his car, but then he got on his bike
with a can (of cat food?) so I guessed he was off to feed more cats
and then would come back and pick up the plates once those cats were
done eating.</p>

<p>Holy cow.  If I could design the perfect water park for me, it
would be a lot like this one in downtown Fort Worth.  Imagine
basically a funnel with water pouring into it, but the funnel is
actually stepped and relatively easily climbable.  Some parts less
steep than others, and some so steep I couldn't climb up them against
the flow of water cascading down.  A big pool in the middle (I'd make
it so the pool was swimmable and really deep and relatively accessible
from all (steep) parts of the funnel so I could slip and just push
backwards really hard and land safely in the pool) with a whirlpool in
it as the water got sucked down.  Wow wow wow.  How fantastic!!!!!</p>

<p>I climbed down the cascading slopes and back up the others and ran
around the perimeter and tried to climb the steepest ones but couldn't
due to their angle and the water pouring down onto me, effectively
dousing my shorts and shirt.</p>

<p>and there were like only two other people there!  How come all of
Fort Worthians aren't there all the time?  That place rules!!</p>
