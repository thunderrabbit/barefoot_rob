                        <p class=date>2:43pm EDT Saturday 12 October 2002</p>

<p>After watching <em>The Princess Bride</em>, Joana and Caycee wanted
to have a party.  Josh (?) Caycee's boyfriend was all, "you can't have
a party without some preplanning.."</p>

<p>Josh doesn't live nearby, so Joana and I went upstairs to someone
else's suite (Brent and Greg?) where some people were studying, and
some were zombified by the TV and/or pot.  Once the studiers quit
studying (not that they finished, but they were all, "well I'm not
going to get any more done tonight"), I kept offering games we could
play Silent Football, Mafia, Dead Fish, Truth or Dare, The Jackie
Purdy Game, Two Truths and A Lie, and none of those fully
materialized, but a few of us played 2 Truths and a Lie.</p>

<p>Then about five people came back from seeing "Red Dragon" and I
blurted, "were you amazed by how the bad guy..." and I tried to not
give away any of the movie, but I did and I felt dumb, but maybe no
one else cared.  I hope not.  Oh well.</p>

<p>We went to the room where people were mostly hanging out and then
they all went to a strip club on the rumor that a girl from their high
school was working there.  They left and Joana and I chatted with some
cat whose name I've forgotten.</p>

<p>Then we went downstairs and cut up magazines to make a collage, but
I was pretty much too tired so I went to sleep on the futon.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Next (this) morning I learned that Joana didn't get to her room
until late because Caycee and Josh were still there past 2:30am, when
she fell asleep on Meagan's bed.</p>

<p>I don't know when (or how she knew she could) go back to her room,
but that's where she was when I got up this morning.</p>
