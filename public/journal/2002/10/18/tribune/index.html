Return to Columbia

Pulling onto Sunset Lane, I couldn't believe how narrow it was.  Not
even a line down the middle of the street.  I crept my car slowly
forward in the dark, looking for familiar shapes.

That's it!  That's the house!  I stopped for a moment to catch my
thoughts.  Several cars were parked out front, so I had to park in
front of the neighboring house. I could see the flickering glow of the
TV on inside, so at least I know they are awake.

I figure I must have carte blanche to just come knock on the door of a
stranger's house.

No doorbell.  I opened the screen door to knock.

A tall kid peers out the top window of the door, "who is it?"

I don't remember what I told him, but then when he opened the door I
said, "Hi.  I used to live here twenty-four years ago."

Amazingly, this was the family of the mom who bought the house from my
parents in 1978.  The mom was in the dining room, and she remembered
my name.

She had some questions that I couldn't answer, like when were certain
roooms added onto the house.  I wondered if my handprints were still
on the concrete slab in the basement where my dad's workbench used to
be.  She didn't know, but she said that's where her washer and dryer
are now.

She did know that Norma still lived across the street.

I walked across the street, knocked on the door.  A woman answered
by opening the door and peering out.

"Norma..?"

"Yes?"

"I'm Robert Nugen."

"What?"  She's apparently hard of hearing.

"I'M ROBert NUgen!"

"Oh my Lord," and she gave me a hug and whisked me inside.

We traded stories; I showed her a picture of my brother who was then
four years old.  She showed me a picture of Carolyn, who now has two
kids and lives up in Oregon.

She fed me two slices of leftover pizza and gave me the couch to
sleep.

- - - -

Next morning I explored the neighborhood during the day.  I spent
several minutes looking for the zipper I had thrown into the street
that was subsequently smashed permanently into the asphalt.  I didn't
find it, but I did see a couple of other items (penny, bottle cap) in
the asphalt that I imagined I do remember.

I walked down toward the creek and stopped short at Hillside Drive.
The hill was <em>so small</em>.  My brother and I used to sled down
this hill in the winters.  Me on the sled, and him on my back.  Wasn't
this hill well over 100 feet tall?  500 feet long?  Steeper than a
staircase?  Not anymore.

Turned right down Hillside Drive, and disappeared into the bushes at
Broadway.  The creek was *exactly* as I left it.  Same amount of
water, same rocks, same everything.  What a beautiful sight.  I walked
downstream (or in this case, downtrickle) about 100 feet, but was
blocked by that same deep section of water than vexed me many times as
an 8 year old.  I chose not to circumnavigate it by walking through
the neighboring back lawns.

Back upstream, through the tunnel underneath Broadway, everything
looked fine until I found a dam with a lake behind it!  When did this
appear?  Who authorized it?  What's going on here?

The staff at the nearby law offices didn't really know when it was
built, but guessed around 15 years ago.  Less than 24 years, in any
case.  Two other folks said around 10 years ago it had been built.
But the prairie of flowers seemed far grander than the small lake.

Up Broadway I walked to D&H and spoke with Brenda who seemed delighted
with my pilgramage.  She verified my memory that the front door of D&H
used to be on the east side of the building instead of the south, and
that the front counter was over there instead of here.

After D&H, I walked toward Nowell's to see if it was still there.  I
knew the walk well because my best friend David and I, plus my little
brother (age 4 at the time) had walked from our house to Nowell's to
see the lobsters in the tank.  We made it to the store with no
problem, but on the way back the sky got dark and stormy.  My brother
began to cry, which made me cry even though David said not to because
it might make him cry.  We were picked up by some of our neighbors in
the pouring rain after my parents had put out a neighborhood alert to
find us.

I feel so blessed at my timing.  The building is still there and I
could barely make out the non-weathered wall where the letters used to
say Nowell's with a big letter W in the middle.  Fantastic!  I peered
through the dusty windows to see medical equipment on the liquor side,
and where I thought the lobsters might have been on the grocery side.

One last adventure awaited me that day.  Ridgeway Elementary, where I
attended first and second grade with Mrs Fales and Mrs Schupp,
respectively.  Brenda had given me directions, so I walked directly
there with no problem.

Wow.  Ridgeway.  It's still here.  Not five times bigger like my high
school.  Not vanished like my preschool.  Just the same.  Only a
little bit of landscaping in front to greet me.

In the office I stood politely for a moment until acknowledged.  "May
I help you?"

"Um, probably.  I used to attend school here in 1977 and 1978."

"Do you remember your teachers' names?"

"Mrs Fales for first grade and Mrs Schupp for second."

"Well, Mrs Fales is now our principal..."

I didn't hear whatever else she said, but the woman I had seen through
the glass *did* look familiar, but I hadn't guessed it might be her!

Mrs Fales remembered me!  What a beautiful thing to be remembered
after so many years.  I told her I was in the midst of a road trip
around some of the eastern states after losing my job in Houston,
Texas.  "So I sold off most of my stuff, got rid of my apartment, and
I'm just driving around visiting friends and family."

Mrs Fales gave me a tour of the school, through several rooms I didn't
remember whatsoever, and then up the stairs to the classrooms that I
remembered so well.

Memories flooding into my mind as I ascended the steps to the rooms in
which I attended first and second grade just blew me away.  Water
fountains in the same place.  "That was the room where you were, and
that was Mrs Schupp's room!"  Mrs Fales nodded.  That's where I
learned to write my alphabet.  That's where I was the only kid in
class to spell "sure" correctly.  That's where I had to miss the rest
of recess after crossing The Big Yellow Line to watch the blimp fly
by.  That's where I remember seeing Nafi cry because some other kids
had called him Nafi Fafi.  (not me, I swear.)

Downstairs, the cafeteria was strikingly smaller than it had been when
I left it.  Mrs Fales tells many former students that they shrank the
school while we were gone.  This cafeteria taught me that 45 plus 45
is 90 because on some days I would forget my 45 cents worth of lunch
money and have to pay 90 cents the next day.

The playground behind the school is almost the same.  A small portion
of it is taken by parking, and the huge tree has passed on to tree
heaven.

Back in Mrs Fales office, she let me browse through the yearbooks,
the oldest of which were 1976-1977 and 1977-1978, exactly the two that
I wanted to see.

I photocopied the single page that includes my picture, David's
picture, and Melinda's picture (who I thought was so pretty that I
kissed her on the knee while we were all sitting on the floor to watch
a film strip).  Mrs Fales said that she had seen David recently, so I
looked him up in the phone book.</p>

I spoke with his mom and learned that he now lives in Arizona and
works as a chef.  What a wonderful revelation for me; I have already
been planning to visit the western states for my next road trip.
