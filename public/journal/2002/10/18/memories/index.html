                        <p class=date>8:55am CDT Friday 18 October 2002</p>

<p>Things I remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>Norma performed a wedding ceremony for me and Carolyn in the
dining room.</li>

<li>learning how to walk backwards on the sidewalk by my house (I saw
a kid do it and thought that was sooo cool!!  ("Look at that!  He's
walking <em>backwards</em>!"))</li>

<li>walking down to Noel's, a grocery store that was just too far for
me, David, *and* my little brother to walk.  It got dark and stormy
and Fred started to cry, then *I* started to cry, and I don't know if
David did or not.  Our parents had activated the entire neighborhood
posse to find us.  We got picked up by them pretty close to our
neighborhood again.</li>

<li>missing my ride to school one day; I wasn't ready yet when the
neighbors came to pick me up.  I remember being in my underwear (or
naked??) while looking out the window as they honked, wondering what
to do.  (old man voice: "yeahp, that was back before we had cell
phones!") They drove away and I knew what to do then: get dressed and
take a day off from school!  It was raining and the creek was gushing
a huge amount of water more than normal.  I am thankful for that
memory; I was amazed by that amount of water pouring out of the
concrete slab underneath the bridge.</li>

<li>My dad lifting me up onto the roof of our house (but I don't
remember why) and then me trusting that he would be strong enough to
help me back down again.  I was really scared to get down.</li>

<li>Going for walks around the block, and for bike rides around the
block, (oh, and seeing a guy ride his bike without using his hands!)
and me following my dad because I knew that *he* wouldn't do anything
unsafe or illegal so if I stayed right behind him I would be okay.  I
remember being confused a bit when he said something like, "well
that's not always true.."</li>

<li>Building a big snow turkey instead of a snowman in our front yard
(possibly around Thanksgiving)</li>

<li>The enormous snowman that someone had built in their yard - at
least 40 feet tall.  Maybe 20.  More than 10.</li>

<li>Learning how to write HTML and Perl. (oh wait, that was
later)</li>

<li>My dad telling me that he couldn't carry me on his shoulders
anymore when we walked.  That was another case of me learning my dad
wasn't flawless and blissful youth wouldn't last forever.</li>

<li>That the cat would sleep on top of the chimney during the winter
to stay warm</li>

<li>Learning what walnuts were (there's a walnut tree in a yard within
the block around which we would walk)</li>

<li>Playing awesome video games like, like, Pong, and then the
incredible Breakout.  wow.</li>

<li>Walking to and from school one day.</li>
</ul>

<p>This could go on forever.</p>

<p><p>Things I remember but haven&rsquo;t seen yet:
<ul>
<li>Apple tree in my back yard</li>
<li>Bushes in Norma&rsquo;s back yard where Carolyn and I played doctor</li>
<li>the terrain in their back yard, with grass on the right and garage
door on the left</li>
<li>the creek</li>
</ul></p>
