                        <p class=date>9:15pm Thursday 2 May 2002</p>

<p>After investment club, as I was about to dial Lee-eh, but then
decided not to because I realized it would be a pain to talk to her
while I was still packing my stuff, I clicked the button to lock my
phone again <em>*just*</em> as it rang and I thereby answered it, not
having had enough time to see the caller ID.</p>

<p>I presumed it was Lee-eh, but I was wrong, so I was all trying to
figure out the voice and I thought it was <a
href='https://www.amymultimedia.com'>Amy</a>, but wondered why she
would be calling me so late after we haven't IMed in a long time, and
she's never called me before out of the blue.</p>

<p>Turns out it was Marta, who I met at Plano Rally, and who just
recently emailed me saying her dad's friend is a recruiter for English
teachers in Japan!  But the more amazing thing about that is I hadn't
told her this was a particular interest of mine, only that I was
interested in traveling.  Wow.</p>

<p>So I'm looking forward to making a connection with Marta's dad's
friend and beginning the process of piecing this whole trip
together.</p>

<p class=date>2:36 am Friday 3 May 2002</p>

<p>Am just now home from Lee-eh's and Lauren's apartment, where I learned
the days of the week in Japanese.</p>

<p>Let's see...</p>

<p>Getsulobi
<br>Kalobi
<br>Tsulobi
<br>Thursday
<br>Kinlobi
<br>Kalobi
<br>Nichilobi</p>

<p>I think that's right except for Thursday, which has ku in it.</p>

<p>The apartment is cool - new carpet, etc, two bedrooms.  Lauren really
wants to get a big dog, and Lee-eh is more wanting a little dog.  Lauren
wants a short nose dog, Lee-eh wants a long nose dog.</p>

<p>I learned the brief version of Lauren's interesting upbringing and
current relationship situation.  Then I was reciting the lyrics to Ludakris
(sp) lyrics 'Roll out' (?) ('so much money.. you can't top that..') and she
has it on CD, so we listened to that so I could get a better grip on the
lyrics.</p>

<p>Something like, 'twin gloc fo'ties, cocked back/ me an' my homies, step
the fuck back/ rollin' on twenties, with the top back/ so much money, you
can't top that.'</p>

<p>Or some shit like that.</p>

<p>Lee-eh fell asleep on Lauren's bed as we traded music related stories -
her meeting band members, me meeting DJs.</p>
