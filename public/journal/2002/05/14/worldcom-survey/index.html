(Please type your answer in between the brackets below)
[Fix your online survey.

(I'm using Netscape Communicator 4.76 on Windows NT 4.0) I clicked on the
link https://www.us.uu.net/support/cssurvey/index.html?A-CNS-000123456 as
indicated above.  This link seems to have the unique identifier that would
take me right to the survey, but it apparently does not.  I am instead taken
to a screen (https://www.uu.net/external/us/cssurvey//index.html) which has a
few problems of its own.

1) This URL has two slashes in a row "//"; this works, but is indicative of
a problem in your URL creator.
2) This login screen has a grammatical error: "it's" should be "its".
3) This screen asks me to enter my User ID, while the email gives me
something called a "logon id"  These two terms should be the same.
4) The screen asks me to enter my User ID without spaces or hyphens, yet the
logon id clearly includes hyphens.  (I tried entering "A-CNS-000123456",
"ACNS000123456", and "000123456" and none of these worked.)
5) The page I receive after entering any of the User IDs above has at least
two problems of its own:
    1) It says "LogonID, 000123456 not found!" (substituting the string entered
for 000123456 in this example).  Note that this error screen gives a *third*
name for the code entered: "LogonID," which is neither "logon id" as written
in the email, nor "User ID" as written on the previous web page.
    2) "LogonID, 000123456 not found!" is incorrectly punctuated.  Remove the
comma and it will be correct. I'll concede that some people would say it's
correct as written, but I think it's non-optimal.]

Would you like a call back from Customer Service?
(If so, type 'Y' in between the brackets)           [Y]

Final Comments - If there is anything else you would
like WorldCom customer service to know, please type
your answer in between the brackets below.
[Yesterday was our first full business day with our T1 line.  The line had
been up for a couple weeks, but we only had test web-traffic on it, making
sure it worked.  We'll give you the benefit of the doubt that it wasn't your
fault that on the *first* day we had real traffic on the line, the telco got
hosed and we had about 5 hours of downtime during the middle of our business
day.  It was quite embarassing for us to say, "oh we just switched to a new
ISP so we'd have *better* service and now we are down until god knows when."

When I call 800-900-0241, I have to press three buttons to get to a human.
When we are in crisis mode that our lifeline to the internet is down,
waiting through those menu items and "this call may be monitored" bullshit
is wasting precious time and dollars for us (and for you, considering you're
paying the toll charges for this 800-number).   When I call, I want to talk
to a human "Right Now."  Like Southwest Airlines.  Those cats pick up the
phone quickly.  It takes about 45 seconds for me to get to a human, even
when I know what buttons to press when the menus begin.

And even when I get to a human, that person is not techinical support.  They
are apparently only trained to fill out or look up a ticket.  And on the
first time I called, the person took our information and was apparently
unable to tell that a ticket had already been opened for this issue!  I
don't know if that was due to lack of training, or a system flaw, but that
wasted more of our (and your) time and money (on the order of 5 minutes,
probably).

Once the person on the first call determined that a ticket had already been
opened, she told us "they have already alerted you, but I don't know how."
Upon retroactive research, we learned that we were sent a fax indicating
that we were down.

(When someone calls back as a result of this feedback, please let's define
exactly how we need to be contacted.  This is the second benefit of the
doubt we'll give you that on our first crisis, you didn't have all the
correct contact information for us.)

In Q1A above, the question is about flexibility.  I described to my boss my
experience from yesterday as working with a big lumbering mammoth that could
not stray from its path.  Is there any way to get a phone number (even if
it's a toll number) that goes directly to tech support?  Maybe to someone
who knows that a ticket has already been opened due to the fact that our
line is down?

Q5 and Q6 I rated low only because I can't immediately get to tech support,
but have to go through the menu and a ticket-opening process as described
above.

I know that your stock has been changed to junk status, and the CEO just
quit.  I trust that the new CEO will shake things up and give you a
smoother, cleaner operation, ultimately taking all this feedback into
consideration.]

Thank you for taking this WorldCom Customer Service
survey.  [Word.]
