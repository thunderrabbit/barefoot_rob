                        <p class=date>8:52 pm Thursday 16 May 2002</p>

<p class=note>(In this entry, I give away details of the movie.  Don't
read the whole thing if you don't want them.)</p>

<p>I'm in line to see the 10:45pm showing of Star Wars.  I called a bunch of
my friends - at least like 7, and got all answering machines, except for 2,
who were otherwise occupied.</p>

<p>So I decided to go alone; I rode my bike to the theater, locked it to
some cables in the garage on the fourth floor.</p>

<p>I got tickets to the 10:15 showing, and went upstairs and found no one in
that line, but Angelique, Aaron, Mandy were in the 10:45pm line.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Robert," smiled AngÈlique.</p>

<p>Awesome!</p>

<p>So I went downstairs and changed my ticket.  It's only an extra 30
minutes.  :-)</p>

<p class=date>9:58 pm</p>

<p>The line is pretty significantly long behind us.</p>

<p>But the reason I'm writing is that I just heard a rumor that in Australia
they are trying to get Jedi listed as a religion.</p>

<p>Jeff just said "Jedi would be my religion; Yoda is my Jesus."</p>

<p class=date>1:16 am</p>

<p>Movie just ended.  EXCELLENT.  So many awesome scenes and funny funny
shit too.</p>

<p>Lot of inside jokes and introducing some characters that we saw in
episode IV.</p>

<p>Angelique was right= no outtakes.</p>

<p class=date>1:38am</p>

<p>Okay; I'm at work now.  My bike was fine, waiting patiently for me
on the fourth floor.</p>

<p>Do not read any further if you don't want details about the movie.</p>

<p>What I don't get is how the good guys got so many clones..  How did
Yoda scoop them all up so quickly?  Did he slide over to that
invisible planet and simply ask for them?  That makes sense since they
were so nice and hospitable, and they believed they were making clones
for the Jedi anyway.</p>

<p>Was that little kid Boba Fett(sp)?  Pretty interesting to find out
he's a clone.  I presume he was the "identical" clone they talked
about.</p>

<p>Um, oh, and who is Darth Sidius?  Is he Senator Palpatine, soon to
be come super all powerful of the Senate, then to become Emperor?
Hmmmmm.  Neat that we got to see Anakin's arm get removed.</p>

<p>Oh my god so awesome to see Yoda kicking some light saber
<em>ass!</em> Whipping around like some Matrix kinda shit all over
that motherfucker whirling and spinning and totally kicking his ass.
Interesting to see Yoda struggle with the 'heavy' object, when later
we've already seen him move the X-wing fighter out of the bog and say
to Luke the difference is only in his mind.</p>

<p>And <em>hilarious</em> that when the fight is over, Yoda wills his
staff to his hand and begins his little Yoda Shuffle to walk over to
Amidala.</p>

<p>I can completely see how Amidala falls in love with Anakin, and
completely see how he is poised to become Darth Vader.  Both sides of
his character were so well portrayed.  And <b>of course</b> I can completely
see how Anakin falls in love with her.</p>

<p>The fighting scene with Anakin, Kenobi, Padme in that big coliseum
was incredible.  So pimp to see all those light sabers light up as my
main man Samuel L Jackson was all, "we gonna kick yo ass biatch" to
that one bad guy.  The way those battle droids rolled in made me go uh
oh, they in some serious shit, man, and then Yoda all in the heat of
battle; I didn't expect to see him all rockin and rollin on a big ass
battleship giving orders and such.  Quite a cool new feature of his
character.  But of course we know later he says, "war does not make
one great." or is it "war does not great one make," or "great does war
not make one," or "does not make one great war." </p>

<p>Oh when those little (big) slug centipedes were all climbing on
Amidala, how did Anakin slice them perfectly in two and not even cut
her sheets?  That's some finely tuned light saber work.</p>

<p>The scenes of chasing that bad-girl-changeling through the floating
freeways of Corisant were better than those in Fifth Element.  Good
job.</p>

<p>I really loved that ocean world.  It reminded me of my query as a
youth if there could be a planet made entirely of water.  Now the
answer is obviously yes.</p>

<p>I think I might have a new favorite Star Wars movie.</p>

<p class=date>2:18am</p>

<p>Emacs rules.  I just taught it what timezone I'm in.  Excellent.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>
