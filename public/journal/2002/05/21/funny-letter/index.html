                        <p class=date>7:45 pm Tuesday 21 May 2002</p>

<p>Recently I have received a few graduation notices.  I feel blessed
each time I get one; thank you to those who have sent them.</p>

<p>But I was just noticing that none that I've ever seen (including my
own) ever have the nickname written on the little card inside.  You
know, the half-size graduation business card with the full name of the
graduate fancily written in the center.  No one puts a nickname I
guess cause they're too expensive to get two batches, and some of them
have to go to grandmothers and such.  I dunno.</p>

<p>I still have not received such a card, but today I got something
close and actually a tad funnier.</p>

<p>I received an official post office envelope with a big square
window on one side with my address visible through the envelope's
window.  I could see they had <em>photocopied a napkin</em> with my
address written on it.  Someone had apparently written me a letter on
a napkin, and the post office photocopied it because it was too flimsy
to go through the machines, or something like that.  I could see from
the return address that it was from either Nathan or Aaron.  Drawn on
the napkin in between their address and my address was a stick figure
on a surfboard, a big plus sign, a picture of a snowcapped mountain.
"Surf Mountain" ?</p>

<p>Printed on the back side of the envelope:</p>

<pre>
WE CARE

DEAR VALUED POSTAL CUSTOMER:

I want to extend my sincere apology as your Postmaster for the enclosed
document that was inadvertently damaged in handling by your Postal Service.

We are aware how important your mail is to you.  With that in mind, we are
forwarding it to you in an expeditious fashion.

blah blah We handle a lot of mail, etc.  blah blah
</pre>

<p>I wasn't particularly surprised that a napkin didn't make it
through the postal process.  I was surprised and impressed that they
photocopied it for me, on a color copier, no less.  Would the original
napkin be inside?  Was it damaged?  How could they have photocopied it
undamaged and then damaged it later?  Was it a proactive
photocopying?</p>

<p>I carefully opened the outer official post office envelope and
pulled out a single envelope on which the photocopy of the napkin was
printed.  I can see now that it's from Nathan.  And he used to work at
The Mountain, so surf + mountain makes sense.  Wait. This is not a
normal photocopy.  It's an image of a napkin, but it's folded into the
shape of an envelope and coated in clear tape.  The post office
wouldn't have done that.  And the back side is a Johnny Walker ad.
How was this done???</p>

<p>I carefully opened the black napkin imprinted envelope and see this
paper has been printed on both sides.  Extra-incredible
mysterious.</p>

<p>How did Nathan get a color photocopy of a napkin printed onto the
back of an image of a guy with his shirt off and a tattoo on his
shoulder, and wearing a MJ sweat band?</p>

<p>Inside the black envelope is an handmade envelope out of a
Fantastic Four comic strip thing.  Nicely non-themed so far.</p>

<p>I opened the comic page envelope and lo- inside is Nathan's
graduation announcement from Louisiana State.  Nice.</p>

<p>I open the announcement:</p>

<p>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAHAHAHAAAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>I laughed super loud.</p>

<p>What's even more funny is that I did not realize until I wrote this
entry that the photocopy of the napkin was part of the Johnny Walker
ad.  He had simply written his and my address on it.</p>

<p>But part of the mystery still isn't solved: There is no postage
anywhere to be found.  Not on the black taped envelope.  Not on the
outer official envelope except for the official printed First-Class
Mail Postage & Fees Paid thing.</p>

<p>Did Nathan somehow get an official envelope and use it?  How?
Wow!</p>
