                        <p class=date>12:41 am Saturday 27 April 02</p>

<p>I'm past Kerrrville Texas now, chillin' with the youth and
scorpions and bushes.  I arrived just as they (youth) were arranged in
a circle giving introductions.  I dunno how long most others have been
here.</p>

<p>Edward and I were laughing at the cover of one of the books on the
table, which depicts an arctic wolf walking across the snow.  I'm sure
we'll see those all *over* the place!</p>

<p>I put some of the lemonade powder on a banana and offered it oh so
innocently to Matt, who took a bite, and then was all, 'why is it
citrusey?'  Funny.</p>

<p>We has been trading scenes from Looney Toons cartoons starring
Foghorn Leghorn and The Chicken Hawk.  'I'm a chicken hawk, and you're
a chicken!'</p>

<p>'No no no, boy, I'm not, I say, I'm not a chicken, c'mon over here
and I'll show you a chicken,' as Foghorn leads him over to the dog in
doghouse.  'Now, <em>there's</em> a chicken for you....'</p>

<p>And the little brainy chicken character who folded a paper airplane
that shot down the airplane Foghorn Leghorn made.</p>

<p>And the wolf who appended, 'man' to most of his conversations,
trying to attract the attention of a dog, so he's got a cat shaped
puppet on his hand, and is hiding behind the fence with the puppet
over the fence.  And he says, 'meow.  meow.  meow, man' and sticks his
head up over the fence to say man.  Hilarious!</p>

<p>As I type this, I have a memory that the cat puppet started chasing
a mouse or something that the dog did to counteract the wolf trying to
catch the dog with the cat puppet.  I dunno.</p>

<p>Bedtime now.</p>

<p class=date>7:25 pm Saturday 27-4-02</p>

<p>Today has been fantastic.</p>

<p>Before sleeping last night, I pulled my mattress off the bunk to
the floor in the middle of the main room, beside Meg on her pink
inflatable swimming pool floaty.  I read more <em>Grist For the
Mill</em> by Ram Dass until I fell asleep.  The constant wind all
night made this a wonderful place to sleep.</p>

<p>Grazed for breakfast - cereal, bagels, cream cheese, yogurt, etc.
Then out to the cedar trees after a speech by Bill who basically said
back 150 years ago this was grassland with occasional oak trees.  Now
it's choked with cedar after it was grazed by goats and such.</p>

<p>So we began to clear out some cedar, without harming the oaks.  or
if we did harm an oak, we immediately painted tar on the wound to keep
beetles out.  Some specific beetle carries a disease or something.</p>

<p>Piled a significant amount of cedar in rows to help stop erosion,
then broke for lunch.</p>

<p>Grazed again, this time I had a suicide sandwich - mayo, turkey,
lettuce, cheese, peanut butter, tomato.  Erica and Joey decided it
must be gross, but Joey tried a bite and enjoyed it.  Yep.</p>

<p>Then back outside and we piled rocks in a gully to help slow down
the water.  Also cut some cedar, and I basically massacred a huge
cedar tree, climbing into the tree way up high or way out on branches
and cutting the end of the branches I was on.  Interesting when the
branch on which I was standing would spring up some when the weight of
the end was removed.  Nice dangerous fun for the afternoon.</p>

<p>Super thanks to Kathleen for being my helper during the day, and
for Edward for telling me funny cartoon summaries while I was climbing
all over the tree and we were the last two people out there.</p>

<p>- - - - -</p>

<p>Tossed some frisbees around for a bit and then did a walking tour
of the land for about an hour.  Saw a couple of rabbits and a huge
porcupine.  There is a landing strip in the back of the property,
cause the ex-ex owners had a plane and would fly in from Houston.</p>

<p>I would pay a few dollars to chill out here for the weekend.</p>

<p>===</p>

<p class=date>2:00 pm Sunday </p>

<p>Chillin' with Jack the Sac on YAC, Erica (oh my!), I Love Kate, and
Mattboy at Joe's.  We're in the corner booth where we hoped we would
find the YRUUers from the church.</p>

<p>Didn't find them, but did find Annie/Jessica's mom, looking for
Annie because she was supposed to be helping her mom pack their house
so they can move today.</p>

<p>On the way into San An, I was listening to some preacher on 92.5fm,
who was dissing other preachers who are on TV asking for money, those
that say, 'the money you give to the church will be paid back to you
multiple times.'</p>

<p><em>This</em> preacher said explicitly, 'that's a lie.  Right here
[bible verse] it says that the money you give to the church will be
stored in heaven, and will be paid back in the Second Coming.'</p>

<p>Interesting.</p>

<p>Oh, he also mentioned where he gave church service each Sunday.  He
gave the address and an apartment number.  Yes, he did say 'apartment
number ___' whatever the number was.'</p>

<p>He also said that joking is a sin.  That being joyful was okay, but
actually making jokes or joking around (especially being a stand up
comedian) was a sin.</p>

<p>Wow.</p>
