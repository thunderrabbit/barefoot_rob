                        <p class=date>5:34pm CDT Saturday 14 September 2002</p>

<p>Janette and I are in the emergency room.  We went down to Turtle
Creek and explored down a big drain tube that drains water from a lake
thing that I'm not going to try and describe yet.</p>

<p>Inside the tube the bottom was curved and slick with slime and she
slipped and I heard her head <em>CONK</em> on the concrete.  Ow ow ow
oh shit.  I hugged her head and held the back of it.  Blood drizzled
down my hand and her hair and shirt and eww.  Doh, this wasn't the
plan at all.</p>

<p>"Okay," I said, trying to remain calm yet assuring, "we need to go
to the hospital." I showed her, "there's blood, see?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't need to do that; I'll just take a shower."</p>

<p>"Joey is going to fire me if she finds out that I didn't make you
go to an ER."</p>

<p>Put a blanket over the seat, checked her eyes for dialation
(Janette jokingly crossed her eyes while I looked) and got ice on the
way home, which spilled lots of cubes and was pretty funny if not for
the blood and guts.  Okay no guts, but blood.</p>

<p>Janette's a brave girl.</p>

<p class=date>6:09pm</p>

<p>Watched an episode of the Simpsons (Homer = Billionaire for a day)
and the ice we had originally all melted, so I flirted with the girl
who registered Janette and got some new crushed ice out of a machine
somewhere.  Awesome.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Background info:</p>

<p>At 4:30pm, we left a note for Joey that we're going for a walk down
at Turtle Creek.</p>

<p>Drove there; it's not too far, and I told Janette all about my joys
and concerns from the past weeks and past few days.  Was awestruck by
a chasm in the middle of the creek, where water was perfectly calm at
the top and just cascasding gently into a cylinder about 25 feet in
diameter and deep enough that we couldn't see the bottom.  Wow!  wow!
wow!</p>

<p>How incredibly cool to just see the water falling into some mystery
aberation in the otherwise perfectly still water.  Niagra falls on a
miniature scale, but still pretty big.</p>

<p>Walked across a street and I noticed a tunnel down in the ravine.
"There's our entrance to the hole!"</p>

<p>So we climbed down into the ravine and walked down this large
tunnel that got darker and darker as we progressed.  About a hundred +
feet into it, the tunnel curved and presto, we were looking into the
chasm from below.  Magic and amazing.</p>

<p>I slipped a bit, but caught myself, and we were all good and about
to leave when Janette was walking her way down the slope and I thought
about helping her when SHWOOop <em>CONK</em> oh fuck that sucks.</p>

<p>Held her, then walked her back through the tunnel and out to the
car.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class=date>6:39pm</p>

<p>Proof that Janette is cool and tough:</p>

<p>"We could get the whole room to play The Jackie Purdy Game.
Everyone could sing a song about their injury."</p>

<p class=date>7:19pm</p>

<p>The guy across this part of the waiting area has football pants and
pads on and his arm in a sling.  I asked him how long he's been
here.</p>

<p>Since 3:30.  He has a deep(?) would between the tarsals(?) /
metatarsals (?) of his hand; he got it hitting the face mask on
another player's helmet.</p>

<p>Ow.  They've been here for 4 hours.  Poop.</p>

<p class=date>8:44pm</p>

<p>Decided to try our luck elsewhere and took Janette off the list at
the ER and drove to the Quack Shack near her house.  But it was
closed.  It closed at 5pm, so we might have barely made it if we had
gone there first.  Oh I think we would not have since we left a note
for Joey at 4:30 for our original walk.</p>

<p>Went to a drive-thru for vanilla shake (me) and chocolate malt
(she) and then to her house to look up another 24 hour emergency room
that's not so backed up, since when I called 411 on my phone they were
unable to help me if I didn't have the name of the place.  It's not
like we need to call 911, but seems like there's a market in Dallas
for 24 hour care centers given that mofos in here are waiting 5+ hours
to be seen.  That shit is fucked up.</p>

<p>Thankfuly, the nurse was willing to put Janette's paperwork back in
line in the same order it had been before she left.  I'm glad about
that; she didn't have to do this for us.</p>

<p>But seriously, five fuckin' hours?  What a fucked up system.</p>

<p class=date>9:03pm</p>

<p>Hehehe, a woman just queried me about my computer.  I like it a
lot.</p>

<p>Oh, and for the record, this is the first time in a long time
(since Arwen twisted her knee???) that I've been in an ER and not been
the reason I was there.</p>

<p class=date>10:24pm</p>

<p>Just now we are back in the ER.  The nurse has done a preliminary
look and guesses that she'll be able to get stitches.  She'll
definitely get a tetanus shot.  Saw our football guy who had already
gotten stitches in his hand.  It was split about 1/2 an inch into his
hand betwen two of his fingers.  I think pointer and middle
finger.</p>

<p class=date>10:51pm</p>

<p>Courtney the nurse has shaved a 1.5 x 2 inch section on the back of
Janette's head with strokes that made me go "eeek! not so hard!" in my
mind as Janette squeezed my hand and I squeezed back while watching
Courtney reveal a dark red split over the lump with lilly white skin
and super short hairs growing all around, and little pink rivulets of
blood easing their way down into the hair below.  If I had my camera,
I would take a picture and I promise I would put it online.</p>

<p>Janette has just left for the restroom to try seeing the
injury.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>The cat to our right is snoring inconsistently with lots of starts
and stops.</p>

<p>The cat to our left said he pushed a bottle too hard into a
trashcan and it broke, slicing up his hand.  They just took X-rays of
his hand with a portable X-ray machine to see if he has glass embedded
that must be removed before stitching it up.</p>

<p>I'm thinking he had to push pretty hard to break a glass
bottle.</p>

<p class=date>11:21pm</p>

<p>Oh man Janette and I are laughing laughing, as we wonder if Joey is
going to ground us and not let me hang with Janette anymore.  Just
called Joey, but she's not home, probably is spending the night
somewhere.  We left a note that included, "don't listen to the
answering machine message, it's a surprise and sorta funny.  Remember
Pandora's Box!"  So we know that she probably hasn't listened to the
message and has no idea about what's going on and that her mom is
about to get staples in her head in the emergency room, etc blah blah
blah.</p>

<p>So we were joking about catching up with Joey wherever she is and
being all, "hey Jo, .. look!!" as Janette twists around to reveal a
bloody gash on the back of her head.  "Here, I'll put some matted
bloody hair on your stuffed bear so you can keep it."</p>

<p>"Mommy loves you, go back to sleep now."</p>

<p class=date>11:51pm</p>

<p>Man, how long will it take for the doctor to get here to staple her
head?</p>

<p class=date>12:07am</p>

<p>Nurse just breezed through and saw Janette's head and breezed out.
Maybe something will happen soon.</p>

<p class=date>12:15am</p>

<p>We are just dumbfounded by the string of medications the nurse next
to us with the inconsistent snoring guy just rattled off.  All the
stuff he is taking from morpheine to brain medication to heart
medication to nicotine patches and all kinds of shit.  He's had
difficulty moving his arm and fingers and obviously difficulty
breathing.  His saline level in his blood is low and he doesn't drink
a lot of water but does drink some tea.  I'm guessing more like Lipton
than Japanese Green Tea.</p>

<p>"That's Western medicine at its finest," I say.</p>

<p class=date>12:24am</p>

<p>Nurse breezed through again, "the doctor is on the phone right now
with a patient, but I'm sure she'll be with you in a second."</p>

<p class=date>12:28am</p>

<p>The hand guy just told the nurse that he pressed an aquarium too
hard and it broke.</p>

<p>Down the hall we can hear a woman crying after some cat in her
family came in with gunshot wounds.</p>

<p class=date>12:44am</p>

<p>Kirk is back and swabbing her head now.</p>

<p class=date>12:55am</p>

<p>Kirk just gave Janette and the bottle/aquarium guy each a tetnus shot.</p>

<p class=date>2:49am</p>

<p>Done.  I passed out almost.  Watched some of the staples as they
were put in, and the clicking of the stapler got to me I think.  And
it kept misfiring and the doc had to pull some out of her head.</p>

<p>The first time the stapler didn't work correctly, the doctor
started to whistle as if to assure us, <em>everything is fine, don't
worry about a thing as I rip these staples out and throw them onto the
floor</em>.  Janette was wincing hard with pain, even though the
doctor had novacained or lidocained her injury (causing a lot of
wincing as well (and a lot of bleeding, which he said was a good thing
since it means the cut will heal quite effectively)).</p>

<p>As I felt myself passing out, I put my head down to get blood back
into it but that didn't help as I could still hear the gun clicking
its evil springy misfirings and the doctor whistling his soothing
tune.</p>

<p>Once Janette was done, I lay down on the stretcher until I was
fully un-passed out.</p>

<p class=date>3:40am</p>

<p>Went to the pharmacy now instead of in the day because I believed
it would be a lot less crowded now than during the day.  I was right,
but the pharmacist said we were lucky; it can get crowded any time of
the day or night.</p>
