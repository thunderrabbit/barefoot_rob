                        <p class=date>11:01am CDT Sunday 29 September 2002</p>

<p>I'm in my own church, outside with nature, sitting upon some
discarded sections of sidewalk dumped into a ravine angling steeply
into the mighty Mississippi River.</p>

<p>This spot is nearly underneath a monstrous iron bridge that has
borne the loads of many trains crossing the river.  I look up and see
a layer of rust and paint covering  huge erector set beams with rivets
speckled across everywhere.  Countless XXXXXXXXX form the beams to keep
them light yet strong.  I wonder how I can get up there.</p>

<p>I see below me a wooden bridge holding up a lush carpet of green
that has taken root in a mass of leaves converted to dirt over the
years.  Looks like an old railroad bridge that travels alongside the
river, not across it.</p>

<p>Below that is the enormous granite base holding the larger grander
bridge.  I see a ladder on that base near the top.  I don't know if
the bottom of this ladder will be accessible, but soon I shall find
out.</p>

<p class=date>11:26am</p>

<p>Wow.  I see (saw) evidence that the wooden bridge had been burned
pretty effectively.  I don't see any close that say if this was before
or after it was recomissioned from bridge to garden.</p>

<p>Climbed down quite a pile of rocks, each on the order of a cubic
foot or three, and all pretty sharp and not particularly stable.
Tricky bare feet get me to the river's edge safely.</p>

<p>Huge barge of 30 big barges being pushed by a barge pusher named
Charles C Ottorff or something like that.  Lots of waves after that
and I notice white stuff floating in the water, some easily
identifyable as cans and bits of trash, some are probably bubbles
churned up by countless boats and pollution in the water.   The muddy
river looks like a deep tan leather color with hazy blue sky
reflecting on it.  Cannot see any more than about 2 inches into the
murky brown.</p>

<p>Many beer cans litter this area, along with what looks like some
plastic bags, shirts, wire, paper, styrofoam, the 12-pack cardboard
case for this beer to be carried down and thoughtlessly discarded into
this otherwise beatiful natural spot with lush vegetation carpeting
the rocks down to within 30 feet of the river, about 10 feet above the
water's surface now.</p>

<p>Even the city itself has condoned littering, with the sidewalk
tossed into the ravine, and hundreds of concrete core samples taken
from concrete who-knows-whats.  5 inches in diameter, round cylinders
about a foot to 18 inches long.</p>

<p>As I write this, I hope my description might be useful to
archaelogists or historians who are researching this area.  Too bad
that I don't really know where I am in terms of the names of this
section of Memphis, but I'm sitting on a concrete conglomerate formed
as a spillway about five feet wide and fifteen feet long ready to
guide water from a 20 inch concrete pipe just on the upstream side of
three bridges.  The bridge furthest upstream holds two railroad
tracks, one with a train coming from Arkansas to Memphis right now as
i type.  it's on the upstream-most track, as the other track has some
railroad cars resting on it ever since I've been here today.  The next
bridge down holds only 1 railroad track, and has a train traveling
from Memphis to Arkansas now.  Easy over one hundred grain cars, all
like twins holding hands across the entire river.</p>

<p>I do know that I'm sitting below the Unitarian Church of the River,
if that gives you a sense of where I am.</p>

<p>Ooh. the train above me is stopping.  Very interesting.</p>

<p>So, um, the next bridge is for vehicular traffic, cars and trucks
and more cars and trucks.  I can see the Wlecome to Arkansas sign
above the roadway on that bridge, presumalby with a Welecome to
Tennessee sign opposite it.  (It's the I-55 bridge)</p>

<p>The grain cars are still going.  Now they have ended.  Maybe 200
cars there.</p>

<p>A tree is floating down river, stuck maybe on a section of rocks
that juts a bit further out into the river.</p>

<p>Across from me trees cover the entire bank, with only a single
barge, and 3 radio antennae towers marring the landscape (not
counting these three huge bridges).  The towers are painted with red
and white sections, as is customary since I've been alive.  I am
guessing the trees are mostly oak, with a few pine.</p>

<p>I shouldn't forget to mention that well upstream from me is the
"new" traffice bridge that Lisa said is I-40 crossing the river.  It
is mostly flat with two hump backed arches supporting the bridge over
its longer sections, designed to allow mongo barges past.</p>

<p>The train above me has sarted again and stopped again since I've
been typing.  The tree has dislodged itself and gently floats toward
me like a weightless astronaut with no schedule to keep. </p>

<p>A man in purple shirt, pants, and *shoes* (I'm barefoot) carries a
camera and tripod over toward me, mostly with his eyes on the rocks
below him (smart) and the river and bridges.  We acknowledge each
other with a nod and slight wave.  He's photographing maybe the train
or bridge or something.</p>

<p>Talked to Randy, who develops his own black and white photos at
home and works in a color photo lab.  He said he was photographing
anything at all, so I showed him the charred bridge.  I wonder if
he'll put that on his website.</p>
