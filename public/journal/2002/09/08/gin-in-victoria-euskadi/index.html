From: my friend Gin from my YRUU days
Date: 8 Sep 2002 18:08:13 +0000
Subj: Gin in Victoria, Euskadi

Hello Luckies, I hope this day finds you happy and healthy. 

      I am feeling well, and free.  I think I stuck with the pilgrims
about 3 nights and 4.5 days.  I walked south westerly with them as far
as i could stand before heading back into the hills with my compass
and a wish.  It was fun, the intense togetherness. i learned some
Catalan, Italian, Brazilian, and for the first time since
understanding french, spent some time with an older generation of
french people and loved their subtle jokes and comments about the
spanish, themselves, and everyone else.  Too many people for me
though.  I like the lone wolf feeling.  Off the trail i went into the
sierra.  The country people in the Basque land are really...  words
fail me again... nice? Something further than that, but they are
amused to see someone walking around with a back pack, unlike the
villages along the "camino", where i got the feeling the locals
thought anything with a backpack was kin to a rabid rat.

       I found myself crossing 3 sierras the other day, so happy and
taking pictures of myself with the basque flag (i was gifted by a
local along the route) on mountain tops.  I was also gifted a map, in
100% Euskera (the ancient language of the Basques). The towns have
Basque names and Castilian (Spanish) names.  In general, the Basques
resent with fury being a part of spain.  My map is all in Basque, a
language that is as far out as Hungarian, or Finnish.  I love it and
have had a fascination with it since i first heard of it.  On the top
of my 3rd sierra some nights ago, i planted my tent.  It was over 1000
meters to the bottom of the sierra and the night was falling.  I saw
the cow patties.  Up with the tent, it was cold and the wind was
blowing.  I crawled in my sleeping bag and the spectacle began.  First
one cow.  They all had big cow bells on... then another bell,
and another.  All sniffing and probably wondering what the hell kind
of creature could look like my tent.  I once was camping in the
Wichita mountains in Oklahoma, and in the middle of the night a herd
of Buffalo walked by and we were left untrampled.  I remembered that,
and thought that i feared not so much as to worry that a cow would
want to cuddle or worse... so with about 20 cows immediately outside
my tent sounding like a Tibetan concert i fell asleep.  When i woke
up, they were so far away it was silent.  The next morning i woke up
and in my pokey morning routine greeted the cows that were smart
enough not to sleep on the top of that mountain.  I eventually started
down the mountain.  The view was spectacular. 

      About an hour or three into the hike i went into a village,  met
an old woman that pointed out where the water fountain was that did
not contain the "shit chlorine" that they are forcing upon them in
their houses.  Unlike France, the small Spanish villages do not have
pay phones or little stores.  They have bread trucks with obnoxious
horns that sound as they roll in with fresh bread.  I left my back
pack by the fountain and went to get half of a loaf of fresh bread
(baguette).  There was a little blonde headed boy chewing on a piece
of bread, his beautiful mother not far behind.  He followed me back to
the fountain, and his mother and i began to talk.  She asked me where
i was from and when she said "oh, Americana..." it must have been the
look on my face, cause she said, "yea, i know, we Basques feel the
same way when we say we are from the Basque land and people say 'oh,
Spanish'..."   I asked her about the history of the village.  There
are 14 families that live in the village, 4 of them speak Euskera. In
1982 when they were renovating the church, they discovered paintings
from possibly the 13th century that show war scenes, a woman being
raped, a guy pooping in a pot, people killing each other, sacrificial
offerings and other strange paintings that would otherwise not be
found in a church.  I asked her to write down several more words in
Euskera for me, like 'please',  then she gave me a little
Euskera-English  dictionary.  Her name is Estibaliz. 

      I took a westward hike towards Victoria that day.  The evening
came, and someone told me about a monastery called Estibaliz just
about on the trail westwards.  I decided it was a sign i should go and
ask the Fathers if I could camp there.  I met a Father Jose, and he
showed me the church, with relics predating the church and worshiping
the SUN!  He really did not even know how to interpret the holy
relics.  I found it most fascinating.  They looked like celtic relics,
but definitely sun worship, later translated to Virgin Mary- Sun
worship.  There were 7 monks (priests) living there, and he pointed
out that their numbers were dwindling because people were no longer
interested in dedicating their whole lives to celibate worship.  I
told him I was not catholic, and that i had recently taken my name off
of the roster at my church in the name of solidarity with all of
humanity in a growing spirituality, without dogma or religion.  We
talked for hours and he seemed quite stimulated and un-offended about
my personal beliefs.  I in turn had questions for him about
Malchisidek and the Virgin Mary.  He is the author of several books in
Euskera, mostly children's stories he heard as a child in a small
village where he was born near here.  He gifted me with the lightest
of his books, and i have been translating the stories one word at a
time.  I had such a nice time at the monastery, it is a wonder i ever
left.   

      On my solitary path, i have a new anthem that i sing as loud and
as long as i feel.  Last year it was 'Pennies from Heaven' and 'El
Corrido de Durango'.  This year it is an old Irish tune called the
'Rambling Rover'.  It makes me think of all of you, and the times and
adventures we have had together. 

     I arrived in Victoria (Gazteiz in Euskera), and the coldness of
city folks is a slap in the face, but as long as i only look at the
old and the young and the freaks, i don¥t feel so strange.  It was
saturday when i arrived yesterday and after washing half of my clothes
in the sink of the crappy little hotel i found i was too tired to go
find the wild zone.  I did get up this morning to make the discovery. 

    This is such a tiny little country, if i was walking every day,
all day, i could cross it in three days.  I think i will continue in
my search pattern, and spiral around a bit.  Durango is not far from
here, and i want to head into Cantabria then Asturias before i hit
Galicia.  If i could draw a connect the dots in this letter from where
i have come from to where i am and where i want to go, ya'll would
laugh or block me off your list.  It is a little loca, but my
pilgrimage was to bring me to the Pyrenees for the winter then to
here, and to top it off, Finistere (after Santiago).  I am only
ripping my own heart out, and inflating my own blisters, so what the
heck, right? 

     I hope this fall comes on slowly, and we behold the changing
colors of the leaves and the scents in the air.   Please hug each
other for me, and know that you are my co-pilgrims.  Thank you for
your love and your energy, i try to remember all that i have learned
from you in our times together.  UltreÔa (go beyond), gin
