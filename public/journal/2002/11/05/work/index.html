<p>Back at the shop now after being at Prestonwood this morning.  I
think I have targeted what is frustrating about working here.  The
rules seem to change continually.  Not rules so much as the
directions/instructions/ideas-on-what-to-do-next.  And who's in charge
here?  Johnny is overwhelmed with details and doesn't seem to have
enough people to delegate to or something.</p>

<p>At the (correct) warehouse near Prestonwood, Hector jumped onto the
forklift, but then this tall cowboy lookin' guy whipped out his wallet
to prove he had a fork lift operator license, like it was a fuckin'
contest.  Hector conceded without complaint, but then refused to drive
the other forklift when Vince suggested that the other forklift would
be helpful.</p>

<p>I, on the other hand, had a great time climbing up these huge
stockyard shelves, like 40+ feet tall.  I started thinking of some of
the drop down lists I could have on my comment section, for example:</p>

<pre>
Why did you climb      that?
            jump over
        skate on
            drink
            eat
            write
</pre>

<p>Or something like that.</p>

<p class=date>8:01pm</p>

<p>Done with work.  Most amazing was a cat named Robert, who
introduced himself as Cornbread to me.  He was the guy who was all
whippin' out his forklift license.  I assure you he was good.
<em>And</em> I got to ride on the forklift!  I was the counterweight
to keep some decks from falling off.  SO SO so much fun!!</p>
