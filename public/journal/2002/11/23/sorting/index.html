<p>How can I do this?</p>

<p>I am going through lots of T-shirts, allocating some to be sewn
into a quilt.  Mostly rally shirts, and I just came across a KTRU
shirt, NIN, The Flaming Idiots...  All the shirts that I <em>like</em>
are the ones I both want to wear *and* archive into a quilt.  Can't do
both.</p>

<p>How can I predict which ones I will want to wear later?</p>

<p>This seems like the same questions as a long haired person would go
through before cutting his/her hair really short.  When should I do
it?  What if I wish I hadn't?  What if blah blah blah??</p>

<p>Sigh.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Next shirt I look at is an ultimate shirt.  Then my Year Of The
Rabbit shirt.  Fuck!!</p>

<p>Will I even be able to wear these in Japan on a regular basis?
Will I have enough space to keep half of them?  Argh.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Here are the single size Tonka Toys sheets I've used at SWUUSI the
past two years.  Should I keep them?  If I am able to go back to
SWUUSI, I will want to use them next year.  Will I be allowed to
attend?  What about the year after that?</p>

<p>Why am I trying to hold on to material possessions that I know will
age and deteriorate and eventually fall to pieces?</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>It's a combination platter of not know what I will experience in
the next few months before I go to Japan, not having any idea what
stuff will be like once I'm there, wanting to be well prepared for any
contingency, having no idea what stuff will help me be prepared.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I think I'll mentally check out by reading a chapter of
<em>Stranger In A Strange Land</em>.</p>

<p class=date>7:30pm</p>

<p>Make that four chapters.</p>

<p class=date>7:56pm</p>

<p>As I left the room in disgust at the seemingly overwhelming amount
of work to be done, my mind touched on the simple solution: "just pack
what I need and go on my trip."</p>

<p>This touches the realm of the Infinite, and has been confirmed with
my experience of rallies, and further confirmed in a conversation I
had some years ago with Cathy Saur, ex-YRUU and now married.</p>

<p>The conversation may have taken place when I drove her to Fort
Worth Rally 1997.  Just me and her for 5 hours in the car.  We talked
about the nature of love and hate all the way there.  Rallies are so
awesome because you don't have to bring anything to the rally.
Anything you need you can just borrow.</p>

<p>I don't know what the average bear would think about this.  But it
solves my problem of sorting stuff, and helped me snap back to the
present instead of hanging onto the past and worrying about the
future.</p>

<p>I'll just pack the stuff I need and not take the rest.</p>
