<p>I'm on 285 going north from Pecos, Texas.  Pecos!</p>

<p>Around me the land is flat flat flat flat.  With lots of green bush
cover.  Like whatever kind of plant we were cutting down at the U Bar
U ranch thing back in June or so.  Cedar bushes, plus a few yuccas
peeking over the top.  The soil looks like broken limestone maybe just
a bunch of rocks.  A single lonely windmill spinning with one vane
missing from its fan (which makes it easy to see that it's
turning).</p>

<p>The sun is considering setting over to my left.  Surface of the 2 lane
highway was rough rocks, and now I'm on highway under construction,
with "lookout!" markers in the center for there are no lines.  No
lights out here either; it would be tricky to drive this at night
without the markers I think.</p>

<p>Eminem's "Business" on loud</p>

<pre>
Just like old times
the dynamic duo
two old friends
why panic you 
already know who's
fully capable
the two caped heros
dial straight down the center
eight zero zero
you can even call collect
the most feared duet
since me an Elton
played career Russian roulette
never seen me blink or get to bustin a sweat
people steppen over people just to rush to the set
just to get to see
an emcee
who breathes
so freely
ease over these 
beats and be
so breezy
jesus how can shit be so easy?
how can one Chandra be so Levy?
turn on these beats MCs don't see me
believe me BET and MTV 
are gonna grieve 
when we leave
dog fo sheezy
can't leave rap alone the game needs me
till we grow beards
get weird
and disappear
into the mountains
nothin but clowns down here
but we
ain't fuckin' around round here
yo Dre
 (what up)
can I get a hell 
  (hell yeah)

<p class=date>5:20pm</p>

<p>I just read the historical marker summary of Orla, Texas, which I
summarize as railroad town abandonded when freeway was built
nearby.</p>

<p>Another historical marker I summarize as some cat named Pope dug a
water well and struck water at 244 feet, but tried to go deeper to
find an Artesian flow, but the well collapsed before its value could
be determined.  I think that means it collapsed before it made money
or something.</p>

<p class=date>5:33pm</p>

<p>738 miles traveled and now i'm in New Mexico.  Super smooth asphalt
two lane highway.  30+ miles to Carlsbad.</p>

<p class=date>6:31pm</p>

<p>I just drove on a road that I thought was the right road according
to the map and its directions, but it was numbereed differently than
what the map said.  i tried it anyway, and it as the right road.
Close to Carlsbad Caverns now.</p>

<p class=date>7:10pm</p>

<p>Despite signs saying "no overnight camping" in various places, I'm
going to park here at a scenic outlook on the way up to Carlsbad
Caverns.  I made it all the way up to the caverns and coasted back
down and perfectly remembered where this outlook was located, *and* I
just turned over 800.2 miles on my trek, so it's a good place to stop
for the night.</p>

<p>I need to remember and subtract one hour from each time since I got
to NM.</p>

<p class=date>6:13pm</p>

<p>It's fixed now.</p>
