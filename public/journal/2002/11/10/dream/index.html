<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>Headlines on TV that we had just engaged in military
battle with Iraq, watching a plane fly in and launch a missle, and
watching the missle as it rocketed across the landscape and finally
detonated near a lot of people and then I was with all the guys from
the Wolf Shop, up on a platform with the bad guys all around us.</p>

<p class=dream>Joe was down below, throwing lines of staples up to us
so that we could use them to fight in hand to hand combat, or put them
on the bottom of our shoes and kick.  Then all the bad guys were
walking away and some other crew of women was walking in to help us
fight.  We came down the stairs because our shift was being relieved
and one of the women took our picture to verify that we were okay.
Her left breast had been naked, so she covered it up with her hand
when she took the picture so as to not distract us.</p>

<p class=dream>She gave me the picture (taken with a polaroid) and
though I had specifically not looked at her breast when the picture
was taken, I was looking down in the picture.  Our faces were all
covered in shoe polish as camoflauge.</p>
