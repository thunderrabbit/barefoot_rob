                        <p class=date>8:11am CST Sunday 24 November 2002</p>

<p>Going to Jefferson church in Fort Worth to pick up Josephine after
the Social Action Conference.  I'm so glad that Jack was able to put
together such a great conference!  I hope it went as well as I
imagine.  Or better.</p>

<p class=date>5:09pm</p>

<p>Today I solved two of Josephine's Infinite Question targets.  One
was "the first person to have a love song written about him/her" (that
one I started a few days ago, and Josephine gave me a good hint when
Jared came into the room with a hymnal).  The other was "the answer to
this question."  That one I didn't perfectly get, but she said it was
pretty clever, which made me think along those lines.</p>

<p>She got one of mine, "the color pink," and she plus Marisa (who
spoke at the Social Action Conference, and whom we dropped off at the
airport) got "Aaliah" (sp), which I actually did to taunt Josephine
because I just kept saying "yes" to Marisa's questions so she could
get it really easily, but she didn't ask a specific question quickly
enough to make my ploy apparent.</p>

<p>After arriving home and munching and saying "fine" "fine" "fine"
"fine" and "dude" "dude" "dude" "dude" over and over with food in our
mouths, we rented <em>Friday</em> on DVD and just watched it.  Good
times.</p>

<p>Makes me wanna make a movie!</p>
