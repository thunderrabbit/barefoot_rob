<p>After visiting a natural shelter "used by Apaches" et. al., I had
some indecision on where to go next.  I flipped a coin to help:</p>

<p>Roswell?  No.</p>

<p>White Sands?  No.</p>

<p>El Paso?  No.</p>

<p>Las Cruces?  No.</p>

<p><em>past</em> Las Cruces?  Yes.</p>

<p>Do I need to know how far past Las Cruces?  No.</p>

<p>Am I ready?  No.</p>

<p>Journal entry?  No.</p>

<p>Check the oil?  Yes.</p>

<p>I checked the oil and it's fine.</p>

<p>Are we ready?  Yes.</p>

<p>859.1 miles since Dallas.</p>

<p class=date>4:01pm</p>

<p>It's actually 5:01pm CST as I'm back in Texas.</p>

<p>Very straight two lane highway here.  I drove straight 13 miles
from White's City toward El Paso.  Then veered right and crossed over
into Texas.  Short mountains loom ahead of me overlooked by the waning
sun.  I have a name for this type of terrain now: chihuahuan desert.
I imagine that is a proper name instead of a type of desert, but it
works for me for now.</p>

<p>Lots of rocks, lots of scrubby bushes; very little juniper.  Some
pear cactus, barbed wire fence on both sides of the highway.  Mostly
just some scrubby bushes I can't identify, but that look dark brown ab
out 3 feet high scattered to cover 35% of the terrain.</p>

<p>CCAUTION HIGH WINDS AHEAD.  Now that was a big warning sign.</p>

<p>Maybe I should drive with both hands on the wheel instead of just
one knee while typing.</p>

<p class=date>4:23pm</p>

<p>Wow.  A new record for Scott: coasting 80 mph downhill.  Coasting.
And that was with some brake application to keep me from going too
fast.</p>

<p>We're on the west side of the Guadalupe Mountains.  oh!  There's
the big sign again..  I'll turn around to get the picture.</p>

<p>See?  Big.  Scott was right beside the sign for the picture.</p>

<p class=date>4:39pm</p>

<p>What the hell is this?  No vegetation.  Just white.  Well a little
vegetation but nothing like before.  What is it?</p>

<p>Salt.  According to this historical marker:</p>

<pre>
RESENTMENT OVER PRIVATE CONTROL OF
  THE SALT LAKES IN THIS REGION,
  OFTEN CALLED GUADALUPE LAKES,
   LED TO THE EL PASO SALT WAR
              1877
 WHICH ENTAILED THE LOSS OF MANY
     LIVES AND MUCH PROPERTY
</pre>

<p>915.3 miles traveled since Dallas.</p>

<p class=date>5:59pm</p>

<p>Scott just pushed a guy in another Camry about 3 miles to a gas
station here in El Paso.  Easy, thanks to same height bumpers and nice
flat straight roads.</p>

<p>Waved adios to him as our cars disengaged.  I continued on to the
next gas station where I found fuel for 2 cents less per gallon:
$1.349</p>

<p>Just called Janette and Josephine to wish them howdy but no answer,
not even their machine.</p>

<p class=date>6:39pm</p>

<p>Wow El Paso is none too small.

<p>I kept thinking "okay this has got to be the end" but El Paso kept
coming and coming.  Then I realized I was on 62/180 and *not* on I-10
as I desired; had I missed it?  I stopped and looked at the map,
decided I had probably not missed the exit to I-10, continued on a bit
and realized I hadn't even made it onto the map yet!</p>

<p>Yup, El Paso is bigger than the one horse town I thought it was.
It even has a mountain sporting a big star worthy of the state
capitol.</p>

<br>white sands.  it&rsquo;s awesome.  you can hike out there and camp, but it&rsquo;s probably too cold.</p>
