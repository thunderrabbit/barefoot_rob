<p>So many fun/interesting things at the advisor training.</p>

<p>Some:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Upon opening, I introduced Lisa's nametag.  Lisa is in Florida
with her dying father instead of at the training.</p></li>
<li><p>Kathryn, upon learning about Thunder Rabbit and that I hug
trees to thank them for such patience etc, introduced me to the group,
including that I was her new favorite person.</p></li>
<li><p>Playing All My Friends and Neighbors:</p>
<ol><li><p>Signing (and speaking) "all my friends and neighbors who know
some sign"</p></li>
<li><p>Fred and I alternating words like a two headed wonder in the middle</p></li>
<li><p>Playing a couple rounds with our eyes closed and when I opened
my eyes being all "whoah!!!!" cause I was on this side of the room
while I thought I was on that side of the room</p></li></ol></li>
<li><p>At the end of the night for worship, we simply said what we
hoped to get from the weekend.  I said I hoped to deeply and widely
dispense wisdom from six years of advising.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>After this first night of training, Fred and I joked about SMTP and
HTTP packets.  I had been amazed at how quickly the comments on my
site are emailed to my computer, and Fred reminded me that by the time
my browser gets the request, the email has already been sent.  It's
just that the emailer waits a minute before it checks for new
emails.</p>

<p>I laughed a lot wondering what it would be like to have a web
browser that only checked once per minute if there were new pages to
load.  Several pages would get cached up and then the browser would
check, flash all of them on the screen in succession and only the last
page loaded would be visible.</p>

<p>Got outside and pretended to be SMTP packets, running down and up
the outdoor hallway.  People thought we were crazy for some reason!
"Don't you get it?" I laughed through teary eyes, slapping the pole
while trying in vain to explain the hilarity.  "He's an SMTP
packet!!"</p>

<p>(turns out he was pretending to be an HTTP packet, but I was hard
pressed to tell the difference)</p>
