                        <p class=date>9:10pm CDT Friday 23 August 2002</p>

<p>At Austin YRUU lock-in now.  They have just been gossipping about
school and YRUU for an hour, while chowing on pizza and cookie dough
and gooey cookies.</p>

<p>Now they have chosen the name/theme of the Austin Rally 2003, one
of the first that I will miss:  Spork vs. Foon.  I suggested Lyle
Luau, which was the theme of Austin Rally 1996, and YRU Conning Me,
which was the theme of Houston 1997.  Fun thing is that no one but me
knew that.  How amazing the speedy turnover of YRUU.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Before the lock-in Fred and I rode our bikes to his school so he
could move his junk from old office to new office, and so I could get
online.  Then rode back to his apartment, I showered, and we then we
rode to church, which was pretty hot.</p>

<p>K B-H just whipped off her shirt ("I've got a bra on!") and then
their DRE Andrea came in.  "HI Andrea!"  It's a black bra; looks kinda
like a bathing suit top.</p>

<p>Cyan (pronounced "sigh on") has red, pink, white toe socks on, with
little cats on the bottom of the big toes.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Funny quotes:</p>

<p>"What's worship?"</p>

<p>"It's what we're going to do in about 2 or 3 hours."</p>

<p>"Oh, that candle thing?"</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>"Wow, your legs are remarkably smooth."</p>

<p>"OH MY GOD!!  It must be guys who are named Ian!"</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>"Here's one in case you need two."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>"Isn't embezzle like the cutest word in the world?  It's like
<em>embezzle</em> and you just want to squeeze it."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>"I think that should be your indian name 'Dances With Dowel
Rod.'"</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>"The doors are all locked, so if we go outside, take me with
you."</p>

<p class=date>10:16pm</p>

<p>Interesting now the dynamics of the group - there is one person
trying to set up to watch a movie, and I'm encouraging Katy to
consolidate the group so we can play some bonding games.  Right at
this moment, the male youth are engaged in carrying a small white
couch into their YRUU room.</p>

<p class=date>10:18pm</p>

<p>Movie is starting; we seem to be in this room and Katy seems to
have lost energy.</p>

<p class=date>12:53am</p>

<p>We delayed the movie until now by playing games: one round of duck
duck goose; one full game of Fuzzy Duck, which resulted in one person
saying "Duzzy Fuck" and a whole pile of people in the middle of the
circle; several rounds of Fruit Basket; several rounds of Captain
Video; some rounds of Big Booty; some rounds of Murder In The
Dark.</p>

<p>Then we had a short worship starring Ian doing the shortest guided
meditation that I've ever experienced.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Now we're watching Heavy Metal (the movie)</p>

<p>Katy B-H here.. so we&rsquo;re watching heavy metal&hellip; which is full of
freaky cartoon sex scenes&hellip;&ldquo;getting a little too excited for church!&rdquo;</p>

<p> I'm just waiting for it to be over so we can play silent
football... which should be fun since most of these kids have never
played, and a few have never even heard of it.</p>

<p>"She's like Queen Arthur!"</p>
