<p>Yay!  Meg Cusack buzzed her hair!  Fuzzy fuzzy fuzzy.</p>

<p>I just rode my bike for a couple hours.  Rode to the lake to the
park where Sean and I first rode bikes around the lake.  Rolled up and
over the teeter totter just to see if I could do it with less fear
this time.  Did it.  Discovered that the weird wall thing down by the
lake is like the facing of some public baths, except the baths are
just concrete sidewalks on top of the lake water, so the lake water is
splashing all around the shore as it does, except there were sidewalks
and a roof above it.  I rolled through one of the many doors in the
wall, out onto a sidewalk with water lapping all around and then rode
out.  Hmmm.</p>

<p>Rode to the nearby Dallas Waterworks building, and then rode along
the slanted concrete of the lake side of a wall designed to keep
people and bikes on the non-lake side.  It was a bit trickier than
last time I rode it due to vegetation growing down the wall.  I didn't
want to ride across it because it would almost certainly provide less
traction than the concrete and possibly send me sliding down into the
water, and I didn't want to get wet.</p>

<p>Picked my bike up over the wall and rode down the other side of the
incline along the non-forbidden side of the fence guarding the
forbidden spillway.  Around the spillway and then up the hill.  At the
top of the hill I turned around and zipped down as quickly as I could,
just to see quite how fast I could go down.  Okay fast, maybe even
pretty fast, but not crazy fast.</p>

<p>Back up the hill again, and this time I waited for a break in
traffic on the six lane road beside the lake.  Got the break then
dropped off the curb into the street to buzz down the hill, but bang
the traffic light was allowing traffic out of some neighborhood so it
was red, so I aborted the mission.  Rode back up to the top of the
hill and when I got my break in traffic, the light stayed green for
me, and it was all good.  But still not crazy fast.</p>

<p>Back up the hill again and then along the lake a little bit and
when the sidewalk turned left along the lake, I turned right across
the six lane street and rolled into a relatively nice neighborhood
with tall trees and limited traffic.</p>

<p>Slow slow riding through the neighborhood and discovered a little
alley way type thing that seemed to run forever behind some of the
houses, a long shared driveway with backyards of houses all along it.
Rolled a few blocks down this alley, greeted by boistrous dogs with
barks less like "have a nice day," and more like "get your ass out of
my alley."</p>

<p>Reached a big puddle in the alley, but it was near a street with a
house under construction, so I rode through the yard so as not to get
wet.  Soon thereafter, I reached the end of the alley, and turned
right toward the lake.</p>

<p>The alley let me rest my legs, so I was pretty much hauling bootay
as I left the neighborhood, especially considering I was going
downhill toward the lake.  I looked up and that same traffic light
that had been green for the neighborhood traffic was again green for
the neighborhood traffic, about 5 cars of which were entering the
intersection in front of me.  I hauled ass to make the light and was
pretty much at top speed pedaling in my top gear (3-8) as I hauled ass
turning left through the yellow light across the six lane street and
down the hill.  Almost super fast, but not crazy fast as I felt fully
in control at all times.  Just pump pump pump pump through the
intersection head down butt up turning on pavement clean and dry,
nothing to let me slip.  Fantastic timing.  Wonderful.</p>

<p>I slowed and re-engaged the lake bike path, saw a female rider in
front of me also on a mountain bike.  Considered talking to her, but I
had to just catch up to her first.  She took the gentle incline up to
the wall, and I tried to muscle my way straight up the incline, but
gravel strewn all over it kept me from making it.  She also took the
gentle incline down the sidewalk near the waterworks, and I dared
myself to go raargh down the steeper dangerouser grass and gravel
incline at an angle to beat her to the bottom.</p>

<p>I chickened out for a while, but then did it straight down the
incline and not at an angle, which was certainly easier in some ways.
I found myself on the wrong side of some holly at the bottom and had
to pick my bike up over that to get over to the sidewalk again.  Back
on the sidewalk, I lost track of the girl.</p>

<p>I guessed she was going around the lake, so I continued that way,
back to the park where Sean and I first rode around, and where I
started my adventure today.  I saw her a hundred meters or so in front
of me, so I set off to catch her.</p>

<p>Tired tired tired, ride ride ride, but I had a goal in mind, to
catch up to this girl, which after not tooo long I did.   And I just
swooshed on past her because I had gotten up some good speed.  My legs
felt pretty strong, and I was breathing slowly, completely filling my
chest with each breath.  Just in the moment, riding my bike really
fast around a lake.</p>

<p>Should I go all the way around?  Hmmm.  I didn't really have a way
to guess which way would be closer to get back if I decided to turn
around.  I kept going.  Riding riding riding, passing some people,
getting passed by some road bikes on the road, with their thin tall
tires and spandex shorts.</p>

<p>Caught up with the road bikes when they slowed down to stop or turn
around and then I headed up an incline and then along another roadway
along the lake, presumably on the opposite side of the lake from the
first one.  Down a steep incline to get back to the lake level, past
some people fishing and such.</p>

<p>I wondered if this boat launch area would be where Janette had her
kayak lesson scheduled for later today.  Riding slowly, looking, and
there she was, with Richard Fine, who make money teaching kayaking.  I
said HI to them just as they were putting the kayak into the water.
Perfect exquisite timing.  Amazing.</p>

<p>They were busy kayaking and such so I began my ride again, looked
up and the girl had just ridden past me.  Amazing timing.  Again.</p>

<p>Nearly caught up with her again and then she took off toward the
left away from the lake.  I chose not to follow her, but continued my
trek around the lake and stopped at a building right on the lake that
Sean and I had visited and looked through the free binocular telescope
thing.  I aimed it back at Janette and Richard, but they were in a bay
with trees blocking my view of them.  I scanned along the shoreline of
the lake and discovered the water works building way over on the left
of straight across the lake, meaning I had gone well more than 1/2 way
around the lake at this point.  I was inspired that my adventure was
close to completion.  I was tired!</p>

<p>Back on bike path again, riding slowly then carefully gaining
speed, and saw in front of me.. the girl on the bike.  Caught up with
her and said HI as I passed her, and then realized hey, she's probably
going around the entire lake; I wonder if she knows how big around it
is.  So I slowed down and asked her as she caught up to me.  She
didn't know.  But she did say that she had walked around it once, and
it took her 3 hours 20 minutes.  At 3 miles per hour, that makes it 10
miles around.  At 4 miles per hour, that makes it a tad over 13 miles
around.  I'm guessing she was closer to 4 than 3 since she is
obviously in relatively good shape, so it probably close to 13 miles
around.  Cool.  She added, "that was the last time I ever walked
around it."</p>

<p>I rode sort of beside her kinda, but not for much longer as she
lifted her fingers off her handle grip to wave as she turned left
toward her vehicle.  "See you later," I said.</p>

<p>Made it around the lake back to the first hill I had hauled down a
couple of times and this time more bike and foot traffic clogged the
area so it was a bit dangerous to go way fast, but I still went pretty
darn fast considering how tired I was.</p>

<p>Down the hill, across the bridge, up the small hill (using a 2 lane
street as a U-turn braking area to slow my descent) and then back onto
the bike path.  Now I was way tired.  And though this section of
sidewalk is flat and almost level, it's a slight grade going up, and I
certainly felt it.  Push push push, past a girl walking in the middle
of the path while wearing headphones to block the outside world.  Made
it past the sidewalk, and then barrelled up the grassy slightly rough
and rocky field to the street and back into the neighborhood near the
Bibby's house.</p>

<p>Low gear like 2-2 going up a steep hill, but I kept my legs moving
and my bike rolling.  No time to give up yet.  Push push push up the
hill, down a slight hill, up another hill, down a slight hill, up a
slight hill and now I was in 2-1 or lower maybe 1-3 or 1-4.  Rolled to
a stop in the shade of a big tree.  Gloves off, helmet off, backpack
off, water in.  Drink rest drink rest.</p>

<p>Tired, but rested, I re-engaged my equipment and bike, rode the
remaining six or seven blocks home.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Fantastically, Rick saw me coming up and opened the door for me.
Excellent welcome back to home base.  Then more pleasant surprises to
find Paul Andrews and Meg Cusack playing Wahoo with Joey!  HI to them
and rubbed Meg's fuzzy head and then again two more times after asking
permission.</p>

<p>Joey needed to go to the train(?) station to go see Laura, so Rick
was here to pick her up.  I finished out Joey's position in the game
of Wahoo and knocked one of Meg's balls back home and then Paul won,
and I (as Joey) came in second.  Meg mocked a single tear.</p>

<p>Game over, they were ready to head back to Tyler, and then Meg was
going to Houston.  I wish them safe travels!</p>

<p class=date>5:41pm</p>

<p>1 hour 3 minutes to type all the above.</p>

<p>I'm going to take a shower and then at 6:30 Cris is supposed to be
here with Marta and we're going to Jenae's party at Monica's
restaurant, and then Marta is staying here tonight and I'll take her
to Plano church tomorrow and then drop her off in Denton (her car has
recently died; seems to be electrical problems.)</p>
