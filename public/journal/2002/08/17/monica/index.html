                        <p class=date>9:46pm CDT Saturday 17 August 2002</p>

<p>Cris and Laura brought Marta to the Bibby's and we caravanned to
Monica's Aca y Alla restaurant for Jenae's birthday party.  Jenae had
had so much fun at Marta's 10000th day party last week that she wanted
to do it again...</p>

<p>This time the party was 16 people and I was sitting next to and
across from stinky smokers except for Marta and Jenae.  It was still
fun though.</p>

<p>Jenae, being the birthday girl, got a shot of tequila poured right
into her mouth (out of a bottle from the bar) by the cute hostess
person who was there again tonight.  I didn't get a picture; I didn't
have my camera; pooh.</p>

<p>Katy, a friend of Marta's who attended Marta's 10000th day
celebration at Monica's (the restaurant), was there again tonight,
which is ironic since she (Katy) was with a different group.  Marta
had considered bringing her (Katy's) Vagina Monologues T-shirt to the
restaurant and then calling Katy to say, "hey come get your shirt,"
(since she (Katy) lives really close to the restaurant (Monica's)) but
decided it was too presumptious to think Katy would have nothing else
planned for tonight.  Funny.</p>

<p>As we were leaving, Katy shouted to me, "Take care of my Marta!"
which is the same thing she pleaded to me last week (over and over).
Alcohol seems to have given her a one track mind.</p>
