                        <p class=date>8:20am CDT Thursday 22 August 2002</p>

<p>I'm going to drive my car to Wende's then ride my bike downtown.
Wende's is close to downtown, and I can shower afterward.</p>

<p class=date>1:42pm</p>

<p>Rode all over downtown, focusing on the new METRORail that's being
built.  Got lots of pictures of various sections in various stages of
construction.  Super fun riding all around.  Got water at the YMCA, at
UH Downtown, and First UU Church on Fannin.  The bridge in front of
UHD is being rebuilt, or at least part of it is being rebuilt for the
train.</p>

<p class=date>3:37pm</p>

<p>I'm at Paint This! now after picking up the unicycle from the
Schwinn shop next door.  I finished the plate that I started on 19 May
of this year, and have been watching the storm coming in from the
north.  The unicycle wasn't fixed, but Jeff showed me what he thought
needed to happen to it.  I called Scott, who owns the uni and I'll
bring it to him before anything else is done to it.</p>

<p class=date>5:09pm</p>

<p>I have dropped off the unicycle to Scott (the person, not my car),
and feel thankful to have that completed.  It didn't feel like I could
get the option to continue borrowing it (it's been 2.5 years so far),
so he has it now.  I had hoped he would have a welder to fix it and
then offer to let me keep it a bit longer, but it will go into Scott's
pile of Things To Do.  Fair enough.</p>

<p>I have just dropped off Scott (my car, not the person) at the shop
to check all his fluid levels before continuing my adventure tomorrow.
I'm chillin' at Kinko's near my ex-work and ex-apartment.</p>
