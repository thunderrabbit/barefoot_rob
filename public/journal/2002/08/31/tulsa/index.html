                        <p class=date>8:29am CDT Saturday 31 August 2002</p>

<p>Good morning!  Beastie Boys playing downstairs on the
phonograph!!  Hahahaha</p>

<p class=date>9:24am</p>

<p>I tossed some bites of scrambled eggs to Fred and he missed them,
but one plop hit him on the forehead. hahah</p>

<p>Last night when Laura Nagel arrived after her long ass drive from
Houston, and she was sitting in the driver's seat of the van, looking
toward the passenger side, with her door open, I gymnastically climbed
in and was practically straddling her before she noticed me.
Hahhaahaa!</p>

<p>Wow!!  9 youth came from Springfield Missouri!  And 2 from
Witchita??  Oh, Witchita Falls maybe.</p>

<p class=date>10:22am</p>

<p>Jordan from House, New Mexico is here helping with the wedding.
Nice.</p>

<p class=date>10:25am</p>

<p>Sydney is a bit deleriously silly right now.</p>

<p class=message>My name is Bob Bob Bob
<br>and I'm from Prague Prague Prague
<br>I have no job job job
<br>but I have a dog dog dog
<br>his name is Bob Bob Bob
<br>he has some frogs frogs frogs 
<br>who are named Bob Bob Bob
<br>they live on a log log log...</p>

<p>etc. Funny.</p>

<p class=message>Chorus: Candy Land, Trojan Man</p>

<p class=message>my ex peed into a can, but then he saw me,
so he couldn't pee, cause he got horny.</p>

<p class=message>Chorus.</p>

<p class=message>Save me from, God's evil plan, cause I got drunk, and
decided to fuck, that stupid bastard.</p>

<p class=message>Chorus.</p>

<p class=message>I joined the fucking devil's clan</p>

<p class=message>Chorus.</p>

<p class=message>Damn.</p>

<p class=date>10:43am</p>

<p>It appears we will be playing a game of Silent Football.</p>

<p class=date>10:44am</p>

<p>Rob = Mr Dictator
<br>Sydney = Mistress Scarlett
<br>Steven = Mr Potato Fornicate
<br>Torrey = Miss Lippenshields
<br>Phat Pat = I'm not going to remember any of these
<br>Reese = Mr Lucky Squirrel
<br>Scottie = El jefe taco with a K
<br>Levi = Mr Bubble Gum man
<br>Connie = I don't know</p>

<p>Pat couldn't remember someone's name, and he knew he would get a
1/2 penance point, so once he got the first 1/2 penance point, and the
person made another error Pat said, "the person in custody..." instead
of "the person 2 places to my left" again.</p>

<p>Pat jumped into the middle of the circle to grab the football that
had been passed back and forth ridiculously multiple times.</p>

<p>Sydney and Levi wouldn't booty dance for zooming zoomed zooms, so I
gave Sydney a penance point and made Phat Pat dance, and then when
Levi wouldn't dance, I made him sing and everyone dance.  We all
bumped booties.</p>

<p>I'm glad Connie played; it was her first game.</p>

<p>No wormholes.</p>

<p>Pat kept doing wacky fwaps and then looking at the wrong person to
confuse people.  Funny stuff, especially after he started looking at
the right person and messing people up that way too.</p>

<p class=date>12:20pm</p>

<p>Whitne has had a Mac since 1979.  Wow.</p>

<p>Her name is so long that the y got lost on her name while in
college.  Her last name took up more space than the y could
handle.</p>

<p>Whitne's sister Courtney was very pregnant and had henna painted
onto her belly while pregnant.  I said, "It will be like a shrinky
dink.."  Courtney got sunburned while hennaed, so now she has a
reverse sunburn of the henna design on her belly.</p>

<p class=date>12:47pm</p>

<p>Whitne just told us that peeps in Japan ride huge ass logs down
mountains in an annual crazy log down mountain riding ceremony!
WOWW!!!!</p>

<p class=date>3:25pm</p>

<p>Talked for about an hour with Whitne, Kelly, and um, that other one
whose name I've forgotten and Fred.</p>

<p>Most fun part was sharing stories of brushes with famous concert
people from Tori Amos to others, to Fred's technique for jumping the
fence to get into the front stage area of concerts.  Pretty
sneaky.</p>

<p>Then I joined the movie room and watched the bulk of Spaceballs,
which I had never previously seen.  Pretty funnny stuff.</p>

<p>In the scene where the well dressed bad guy tells the Dark Helmet
bad guy to not have his mask down because he could be making faces,
and then the mask is lifted and he is making faces, I was all, "that's
you Edward [Lerner]."  Funny.</p>

<p>l<p class=date>4:08pm</p></p>

<p>Fun just now playing follow the leader on the playground equipment
outside with Scottie from Oklahoma, and Reese from Corpus Christi.</p>

<p>Then fun with some ragatag sound effects on the organ with Laura,
Rowboat, and Mattboy.  I danced a mild version of Rob's Crazy
Dance.</p>

<p>Touchgroup meeting now and we are deciding who goes on social
action.  Ooh now we are doing the name and pizza topping game.</p>

<p>Noah joined our circle and we made Claire guess what type of pizza
he likes so she guessed Meat Lovers and was correct.  When it was
Cody's turn, he was all, "... and that's Noah, he likes
meatloaf..."</p>

<p class=date>4:21pm</p>

<p>Now Laaura is making up a song about wanting to be Kate.</p>

<p>Oh, nevermind, it's a Benfolds Five song.</p>

<p class=date>5:41pm</p>

<p>We played Jackie Purdy's Game before social action of picking up
newspaper around the neighborhood, and bouncing around a golf ball
that Skyler found in a gutter and I subsequently got it out.  Fred and
I read 3 Sundays worth of comics and played around inside and outside
of Bill's pickup truck while he drove slowly through the parking lot.
I bounced the golf ball on the pavement (actually Amy Wakoviak was
driving) and I was quite entertained that the ball bounced back up to
me and appeared to be going straight up and down, though from the
point of view of the parking lot was probably bouncing with 10 or 15
foot wavelength.  Excellent physics.</p>

<p class=date>6:46pm</p>

<p>Been playing a bit (and losing) but mostly watching Kenny vs Edward
playig super golf 3 or something.  Funny game with good instant
replays.  I'm going to get some dinner and try to find Mikey to play
follow the leader with him outside.</p>

<p class=date>7:15pm</p>

<p>Just played follow the leader with Mattboy, Noah, David McQ, and a
guy whose name I don't know (he wears black boots).  Everyone (almost)
got to lead some, and it was definitely strenuous and fun fun fun.</p>

<p>Dunno where Mikey was except "with Erica."</p>

<p>Now we are assembly for what is apparently going to be an agony
meeting before dinner.  I'm guessing it will be something the Chris
tries to lead.  We'll see how it goes.</p>

<p>Well, at least Gram and Ben are the ones getting people's
attention.</p>

<p>Wow.  Erica is up front starting the meeting.  What a change from a
couple years ago.</p>

<p>What?  This is about OKC rally?  Weird.</p>

<p class=date>7:31pm</p>

<p>Hmm.. very interesting; I've not seen this before.  Some youth were
drinking at OKC and have been given community service, and are not
being identified to the community.  Interesting how youth empowered
this seems to have been; excellent job, my beloved YAC!</p>

<p class=date>8:25pm</p>

<p>Awesome to see Stacy Craig, the previous paid youth director at All
Souls.  Big hugs from her and got to see her twins.  She says that Bob
Gupton taught her Silent Football.</p>

<p><em>Excellent</em> soy drink shared with Laura and Hethre.  Laura's
expression went from shock/surprise to wonderful happy delight.</p>

<p class=date>8:31pm</p>

<p>Now we're watching a fantastic set of photos from Marlin's
fantastic bicycle trek across Japan and China and Mongolia and all
kinds of wild shit.  He just showed us a yert!!</p>

<p>Holy fucking shit this is SO COOOOOLL!!  My God this is
<em>EXACTLY</em> what I want to experience!!!!  They knew *nothing* of
Chinese or Tibetan language and this is just so incredible!!  Fucking
A.  Wow.</p>

<p>"They use elephants like billboards.." drape a sheet over it and
advertise the latest toothpaste or snake oil or whatever..</p>

<p class=date>9:18pm</p>

<p>Holy shit this is so amazing!</p>

<p class=date>9:19pm</p>

<p>Oh man..   some of the towns converted to unitarianism in like
budapest and stuff and they painted over the old frescos on the
walls.  ooohhh  man..</p>

<p class=date>9:39pm</p>

<p>For sixty five dollars Marlin had some guys repair his bike that
had been totally shredded by a tractor - spokes destroyed and cranks
destroyed and frame broken.  spokes and sprockets had to be hand made
and frame was aluminum and had to be repaired .. so amazing.  The guys
who heard how much they paid were all "oh you got ripped off" which is
a totally amazing statement on our economy, but I can't tell what it
says exactly - something like what we think is a trivial amount of
money is a huge amount of money to another culture...  I'm not sure if
that all makes sense, but maybe...</p>

<p class=date>9:43pm</p>

<p>Wow.  UUism is so completely incredibly connected and awesome; I am
so enthused and happy to have such connections.</p>

<p class=date>10:11pm</p>

<p>HOLY SHIT!!!  That is so uber fantastic it's like starting out in
Japan making some bling is <em>exactly</em> how he started his trek.
Fuck!!  Wow!!!  I'm completely utterly *<em>thrilled</em>* at the
prospects of beginning such an adventure myself.  Wow.
wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. wow!!!!</p>

<p class=date>3:23am</p>

<p>I slept through part of the dance and most of the worship and part
of the talent show, most notably not the part when Phat Pat, Mattboy
and I did Three Headed Wonder.</p>

<p>Silent Football now.</p>
