                        <p class=date>3:25am CDT Sunday 1 September 2002</p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, this game of Silent Football is about to
commence. Our dictator for this game is, as usual, Rob Nugen, and our
note taker is Ben B. The players for this game are as follows:
<br>Amy Baby
<br>Miss Psycho Sexy
<br>Tikki Master
<br>Lady Athena
<br>Mr. I Have a Cool Name
<br>Rowboat
<br>I'm thinking
<br>Bartleby
<br>and Happy Shrugs a Lot</p>

<p>Happy Shrugs a Lot - "I was listening! I WAS LISTENING!!"</p>

<p>Mr. I Have a Cool Name - "A less embodied char of empty penance points for saying 'he'"</p>

<p>Bartleby - "Bartleby has enough trouble keeping $2000," pause, "3?? </p>

<p>Mr. IHCN accusing Bartleby "quote $3000 worth of computer, blah blah
blah, it it it, unquote"</p>

<p>Customary it it it it it it</p>

<p>Happy Shrugs a Lot's name changed to Frontega</p>

<p>Amy enters as Fandango</p>

<p>Customary I'm MC speller and like to spell, S-P-E-L-L spells spell!</p>

<p>Customary we got shroop, yes we do, we got shroop, how 'bout you?
<em>SHROOOP!</em></p>

<p>Miss Amy Baby - "Mr. Shlong-Tots!" which was incredibly cute.</p>

<p>Frontega tries to relieve herself and Fandango of penance points,
Mr. Dictator - "Preposterous!"</p>

<p>Bartleby's bad puns aren't funny.</p>

<p>I'm thinking looses the sacred football for eternity into the black
hole that was Happy Shrugs a Lot</p>

<p>"All I want to do is do a fwap fwap fwap and a quack quack, jump shake
your rump!"</p>

<p>Mr Dictator, what the hell is Bartleby doing?
Receiving a half penance point!</p>

<p>Rowboat preforms a very cute thumbs up shrug</p>

<p>Mr. Dictator does a booty dance!!!</p>

<p>Two way worm hole between the sacred football hogging I'm Thinking and
Mr. IHCN.</p>

<p>Mr. IHCN - "Has anyone ever REALLY played with a wormhole?"</p>

<p>Mr. IHCN must 5 times recite "Never shrug a shrotem/shrotem a shug" It
is impossible describe in text how funny this is.</p>

<p>I'm Thinking becomes I'm Not Thinking because, quite frankly, she
isn't exactly.</p>

<p>Miss Amy Baby - "<em>Mr. Dictator!</em>"</p>

<p>Emperor One Eyed Snake, Saving Grace of the Irish.</p>

<p>Joel falls off of stage. "What just broke?" "Joel did!"
Calder - What happened? Joel - I fell off the stage.</p>

<p>Miss Amy Baby totally misses the fact that there is now a wormhole
between Mr. Dictator and Lady Athena</p>

<p>spread 'em!

<p>im a  maniac maniac on the floor.  and im dancing like ive never danced
before.</p>

<p>ellen is neither a black hole nor in the game.  crazy.</p>

<p>nuttin-pat</p>

<p>SHRUGFEST!!!  YEA!!!</p>

<p>robs computer is a cutie.</p>

<p>mr shaft tots.  yea!  shaft*</p>

<p>customary g-n-u spells gnu.</p>

<p class=date>5:28am</p>

<p>I just gave the dictatorship to Calder.</p>

<p>The game is losing energy I think.  this is rob typing now.  Shit I
just stole the football from Madame Dictator.</p>

<p class=date>5:39am</p>

<p>Now I have just zoomed the football since no one would do sumpin.</p>

<p>tiki master is now a black hole due to rapid falling asleep.</p>

<p>mr. i have a cool name resigns to sleep, leaving the game with only
four players..</p>

<p>welcome fandango, bye fandango.</p>

<p>rolling golf balls everywhere!!!</p>

<p>meow....hairballs!</p>

<p>fandango is back in tha game.</p>

<p>and thunder rabbit is still wasting the universe's time,
accompanied by madame dictator.</p>

<p>new quote of the day: it's not the size of the love that counts,
it's the size of the dic-tator.</p>

<p>miss psycho sexy, after having her name changed from miss psycho
sexy to miss burps a lot, and now has had a new name change to miss
doesn't want to burp a lot which amkes the universe sad.</p>

<p>miss doesn't want to burp a lot which makes the universe sad now
has only 3.0.</p>

<p>thunder rabbit has provided the universe with an extraordinarily
foul odor that will forever ruin the air supply.</p>

<p>no he didnt</p>

<p>yes he did</p>

<p>the game ends with a spilled root beer due to thunder rabbit's
severe lack of motor skills and his carelessness for the feelings of
others.</p>

<p>yea we didnt
<br>no we did
<br>yea we didnt
<br>no we did
<br>yea we didnt 
<br>no we did
<br>wait..penis...huh?
<br>-miss psycho sexy</p>

<p>CALDERS BEDTIME STORY FOR MARTA AT 7 30 IN THE MORNING </p>

<p>so this pirate named marty walked into a bar with a steering wheel on
his crotch that had a white sticker on it that said red delicious s&m
#4015 washington and had a picture of a red apple with a red leaf and
a red stem on it and the apple was super pretty and super.  and the
bartender said to him, "hey, ya know you got a steering wheel on your
crotch that has a white sticker on it that has a picture of a red
apple with a red stem and a red leaf and the apple is super pretty and
super and it says red delicious s&m #4015 washington it?"  and the
pirate said "arrrrrrr its drivin me nuts!!!"
<br>buh-dum-ching!
<br>marta:tell me about his twin sister roberta.
<br>calder: well first of all she isnt his sister, she is a
hermaphrodite.  and her name is not roberta, it is robertoa.  
<br>marta:  is that like protozoa?
<br>calder:yes, and they called her boa for short, cos she looked like a
snake.
<br>marta:  a one-eyed snake?
<br>calder:yes.
<br>marta:and what was unique about her?
<br>calder: well her thunderrabbit rob put a sticker on her face at 2 in
the morning saturday that said red delicious s&m #4015 washington and had a
picture of a red apple with a red stem and a red leaf and the apple
is super pretty and super.
<br>marta:  did she have any pets?
<br>calder:yes, she had a pet thunderrabbit named rob and a new species of
animal with red hair and a sticker on its face that red delicious s&m
#4015 washington and had a picture of a red apple and a red leaf and a
red stem and the apple was super pretty and super, and it was called a
