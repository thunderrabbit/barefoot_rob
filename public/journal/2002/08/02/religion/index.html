                        <p class=date>1:12pm CDT Friday 2 August 2002</p>

<p>Back in my early queries of the nature of God, I heard someone say,
"what if Christianity is correct?  wouldn't it be sad to go to hell
just because you didn't believe the Bible?"  or something like that.
This line of reasoning scared me into being/wanting to be Christian
for a while - a few months maybe. I dunno.  That was during high
school I think.</p>

<p>What really first made me question the Christian myth was that
everyone was saying they were the chosen people, and that everyone
else was going to hell.  In my mind, this is ridiculous.  There must
be an empirical way (if that's the correct term) to determine who are
the chosen people.</p>

<p>Even so, I reasoned that there shouldn't be a chosen group on some
basis of external qualities or associations; if anything it would have
to be an internal willfull choice that a person could make to
determine if God would like him/her or not.</p>

<p>This line of reasoning could be extended to validate the Christian
faith.  "God loves those who accept and trust Jesus as their Lord and
Savior."</p>

<p>The problem I have with the above statement as the requirement to
be accepted by God is that it presumes that everyone will hear the
statement to even have a chance to believe it.  Some people trust that
"missionaries" will spread the word, giving everyone at least one
chance to believe their statement.. but how ridiculous is that to
believe that some group of people who has lived in a
jungle/desert/island/mountain for thousands of years will be greeted
by a person bearing the Christian belief at least once per human
generation (so that each individual in the group will hear the
message)?  And that one missionary could sway the belief of hundreds
of people?  Why would a stable group choose to switch up all their
beliefs?  In some cases missionaries are 'successful' in their
attempt.  I don't believe they can realistically spread their Word to
everyone in the world.</p>

<p>- - -</p>

<p>I saw a church marquee that shifted my thoughts further.  It read
something like, "Love does not keep a record of others' mistakes."  It
was outside a baptist church way out in the country somewhere.</p>

<p>I thought, "aww, that's nice.  Love does not keep a record of
others' mistakes..." and I rolled the phrase through my head a few
times, feeling it, testing it.  Then I remembered something else I
have heard *many* times: "God is love."</p>

<p>You may see where this is going.  Now, obviously, these statements
(at least the marquee) are not written in The Bible, so someone who
believes The Bible is the Holy Inerrant Word of God would say, "but
that was just a marquee written by a human."</p>

<p>But I see the huge mathematically proveable fallacy: God is Love.
Love does not keep a record of others' mistakes.  Therefore God does
not keep a record of others' mistakes.  However, according to
Christian belief, God does judge us when we die.</p>

<p>I suddenly recognized I had discovered a paradox.  It can be
explained away by saying that we don't understand the mind of God, but
I don't buy that.  I think the mind of God is exquisitely simple, not
full of paradoxes.</p>

<p>In trying to discern the truth, I focused on a belief I still held
as true: God is Love. God is Love.  I also have a belief that God is
the universe, or that the universe is part of God, therefore God is
everywhere.  Therefore love is everywhere.  The love of God is
everywhere, all the time, forever and ever.  Hmmm.</p>

<p>If God is Love, and Love is everywhere, then I believe two things
further:</p>

<p>1) God does not judge me (because God is Love)</p>

<p>2) Even if God did judge me, God cannot reject me. (notice the word
'cannot') There is no place I can exist without God being there.  If
there is such a place where God does not exist, then God is not
everywhere, and therefore is not God.</p>

<p>Now, it *is* possible for me to ignore God's presence.  I have free
will and am therefore able to ignore God.  But it cannot and does not
happen the other way around.  God is always aware of me and always
loves me.</p>

<p>If I truly love someone, I accept all their parts.  God is the
Universe is God. God is love.  I can do *anything* I want and God will
still love me.</p>

<p>So, wait wait wait.  I can do *anything* and God will still love
me?  Yep.</p>

<p>I can kill someone and God will still love me?  Yep.</p>

<p>I can kill 5000 people and God will still love me?  Yep.</p>

<p>How does that work?  I think this is where something called karma
comes in.</p>

<p>- - - - - chapter two - - - - -</p>

<p>There was a period in my life where I experimented with lucid
dreaming (being asleep, and dreaming, yet being conscious that I was
asleep and dreaming).  I had a goal of being able to project my
consciousness into the astral plane - to be consciously awake yet
outside of my body.</p>

<p>I was able to lucid dream relatively frequently.  I can describe
techniques if you are interested, or you can look them up online of
course.</p>

<p>One time I was sleeping, and I realized I was dreaming.  I noticed
that my legs were literally above my head, like I had been folded in
half.  I felt a bit frightened; my legs had never done that before;
was I broken?</p>

<p>Then I realized my non-physical legs were outside of my physical
body.  They were projected out of me.  I allowed my consciousness to
leave my body more completely.  My non-physical body floated upward,
but I basically seemed stuck at my head.  I couldn't get my
astral/spirit head out of my physical head.  I relaxed and felt my
body slowly reintegrating with my physical body.  The process was slow
and steady and vibrationally electric feeling.  Very smooth
transition, and I was quite conscious the entire time through the
reintegration.</p>

<p>I lay there in my bed for a moment to store the experience
carefully in my mind.  Once I had recalled the entire experience I
slightly moved a single physical toe.  The sensation was that of toe
touching my bedsheet in such a way that I knew my physical body had
not moved for a long time.</p>

<p>What this experience meant to me is that I can exist outside my
physical body.  Okay, so I had not been able to get my head out, but I
fully believe that with practice I'll be able to do this as well.</p>

<p>What this means to me is I have a consciousness that exists even
without my physical body.  I will continue to live after my physical
body dies.</p>

<p>- - - - - - - - - Chapter Three - - - - - - - -</p>

<p>In 1997 or so, I met a man named Joe McMoneagle.  He has served in
the army, had an experience that made him decide not to kill people
for a living, left the army (at least the killing part) and is now a
professional remote viewer.</p>

<p>I got to meet him because I was at The Monroe Institute, an
organization dedicated to using audible signals to help people reach
alterred states of awareness.  I had a goal of learning how to astral
project.</p>

<p>Joe is/was a friend of Robert Monroe, the man who started the
institute (and who has since died (physically)).  While at the
institute, we participants got to meet Joe and hear his story.</p>

<p>Joe McMoneagle is a well built man, who seems quite centered in his
Self.  I capitalize this word to indicate something greater than just
the ego, a manifestation of the physical body.  He doesn't seem larger
than life.  He just seems fully alive and at peace.</p>

<p>The sense I got when he spoke with us is that he was telling the
complete truth as he was aware of it.  He was fully open to telling us
anything about himself.  The only things he would not tell us were
those that were classified as Secret by the government, or by the
company for whom he was doing work.</p>

<p>Joe told us a story about his days in the Army.  I will tell a
short version here.  He was in Germany, in a bar.  He had something to
drink and then felt sick.  He walked out of the bar to get some fresh
air, tripped on the steps but caught himself before he fell.  He felt
better, but then noticed something.  It was raining outside, and the
rain drops were passing through him.  He looked around and noticed
something else.  His body was collapsed outside the steps of the
bar.</p>

<p>His friends rushed to his aid and took his body to a hospital.  Joe
followed along, memorizing as many details as he could.  Eventually he
became bored with the scene, and felt it diminishing away from him.
He found himself in a place of complete Peace and Love.</p>

<p>There were beings before him.  They were with him as he witnessed
all the details of his life in exquisite precision and awareness (life
flashing before one's eyes).  He was able to see how his actions
affected others around him in his life.  He witnessed everything from
start to finish (I didn't ask him what he meant by the start.
conception?  birth? awareness of self?) in super high technicolor and
awareness.  This seemed to all flash by in a brief moment.</p>

<p>The being with Joe took the 'contents' of Joe's life and said, "you
don't need this anymore," and released it.</p>

<p>There was no judgement of Joe's life (except possibly any judgement
that Joe brought to it).  No one who said, "that was good, that was
bad" etc.  All was pure and total Love.</p>

<p>So Joe realized he was dead.  He had just relived his life, and
that was it.  But then he was being sent back to his body.  He
couldn't resist.  He was simply sent back even though he really
enjoyed the Love all around him.</p>

<p>Back into his body, he sat up (much to the surprise of the nurse)
and just grabbed the pen from her coat pocket and began to write down
everything he possibly could about the experience.</p>

<p>- - -</p>

<p>After Joe's story, I asked a question.  "The next time you die, not
that I want you to die anytime soon, do you think you will rexperience
your life from the beginning again?"</p>

<p>He answered immediately.  "No.  At least I didn't.  I had a second
near death experience."</p>

<p>Everyone in the room nearly gasped at this revelation. Joe said
that he didn't die the second time because he had no fear whatsoever
of dying.  He had had a major heart attack, but remained completely
calm for the 45 minutes it took to get him to the hospital.  His calm
attitude is quite likely what kept him alive.</p>

<p>- - - - - - - - - - Chapter four - - - - - - - - -</p>

<p>Karma</p>

<p>There seem to be some consistent laws in the world and possibly
throughout the universe.  I've heard that gravitational attraction is
pretty consistently followed throughout the universe.  And this
constant speed of light thing, and other measurements that seem to be
constant and follow predictable graphs...  You know what I'm talking
about: the "laws of physics."</p>

<p>So what if there are other levels of reality?  Realms different
than the physical realm, like the emotional plane, and the astral
plane, and the ethereal plane...  I believe we exist on these planes
as well, but we have only really become aware of the physical plane,
and a bit aware of the emotional plane.</p>

<p>If these other planes exist, it makes sense to me that there would
be some laws to describe how energy moves around on these planes.</p>

<p>There have been experiements done that suggest plants can be
affected by our emotions.  this link doesn't really indicate this, but
it's in the right direction:
https://www.thebigholistic.com/products/kirlian/kirlian2.htm</p>

<p>My point is that what if there is a field in the emotional plane
that has the equivalent of a north and a south magnetic poles?  What
if the poles are called love and fear?  would it be possible that
there are "laws" saying that love attracts love and fear attracts
fear?  or a law that says love is helpful, fear is not helpful?</p>

<p>I dunno.  But I don't see why there can't be some sort of laws in
the emotional plane.</p>

<p>From what I can tell, my life seems happier and more fun when I
love myself and others.</p>

<p>- -</p>

<p>Oh, oh, oh, I've got a good law for emotions: Fear is sticky, Love
releases.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>* I hold things (people, possessions, concepts) close to me if I am
afraid of 'reality' or change.</p>

<p>* "If you love someone, set them free"</p>

<p>* If I fear change, I hold close to what I perceive as my preferred
reality</p>

<p>* If I'm in peace and love in my heart, I free myself from being
affected by changes around me</p>

<p>Maybe those are the basic laws of Karma.</p>

<p>If through fear and anger I kill or otherwise dramatically affect
another's life, then their spirit/soul gets stuck to mine, bringing
them back into my life later, maybe in a future life.</p>

<p>If I, through love, forgive the wrongs of another, that releases
them into freedom, unsticking our spirit/souls.</p>

<p>------------ Chapter Five --------------</p>

<p>Dharma</p>

<p>I believe that we each come to earth with some sort of mission, or
thing(s) we are meant to accomplish.  This may be stuff like what type
of life to experience, who to marry, what profession to achieve, where
to live, who to help, who to be hurt by, Brain capacity, body type,
sexual preference, city of birth, etc etc etc</p>

<p>Maybe some people have a task of creating a huge thing for the
world.  Maybe some people are supposed to just walk the earth.  Maybe
some people will share stories and wisdom with others.  Maybe some
people will work as social service for the community.</p>

<p>Some will invent a new mathematics; some will invent a new
invention; some will teach games; some will play games.</p>

<p>Each life has a purpose (or two, or a thousand) that it may fulfill
in a lifetime.  There is no real punishment for not fulfilling a
purpose; an opportunity will be created later for that purpose to be
fulfilled.</p>

<p>I think that at each moment, we are able to choose actions.  Some
actions are guided by love and move us closer to fulfilling helpful
meaningful things, freeing ourselves and others to be one with God.
Some actions are guided by fear, binding our souls and spirits and
emotions to non-permanent objects and egos and concepts.</p>

<p>I'm just beginning to conceive ideas around Dharma, open to
allowing myself to live life in love as much as possible.</p>
