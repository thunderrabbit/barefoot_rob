                        <p class=date>6:15pm PST Friday 20 December 2002</p>

<p>I'm about to get Scott from the garage where he's been sleeping,
retrieve my skates and join the Friday Night Skate around SF.  Nice.</p>

<p class=date>11:57pm</p>

<p>Back at Wende's now.  What an incredibly excellent skate!!</p>

<p>The short version is that no one else showed up for the Friday
night skate, but I saw two trolleys driving by with Carolers singing
and wishing people happy holidays and all sorts of positive energy
flowing from them, so I followed them to Ghiradelli Square and hung
out for a bit.</p>

<p>Left Wende's with skate on feet around 7:20pm. I found the streets
quite wet, but not too slick, though some of the downhills were a bit
tricky to slow down completely before I got squished by cross
traffic.</p>

<p>I thrilled down Mission (?) toward the downtown area where Wende
works, right down the lanes with the cars, and sometimes faster than
them down the hill, especially if they were slowed down by red traffic
lights, I'd zip between the cars to the front of the line, and
sometimes skate across the red light if I could do so safely.</p>

<p>Awesome to roll along with traffic across a big intersection with
several slick and slightly bumpy trolley tracks strewn across it.
Navigating myself along within the cars, watching the street to make
sure a skate doesn't get lodged in the groove of a track (mostly
difficult in this case because I was mostly going right across them,
not along them) and watching for pedestrian traffic that might be
jaywalking (how rude!).</p>

<p>Dropped off Wende's apartment keys at her work (she has an extra
set of all but the outside door to get into the building) in case I
was still skating at 11 when she got off work.</p>

<p>Basically hauled butt down Market toward the Embarcadero, sometimes
having to stop for red lights, sometimes getting to sail across the
intersections, navigating people and sometimes jumping off the curb
into the street if the sidewalks were too crowded.  The streets were
awesome because the rougher surface allowed my skates better grip and
therefore greater acceleration and speed for me.</p>

<p>At what I presumed was the Embarcadero, where we were supposed to
meet, I found no one.  Well, no skaters.  But then again I was 15
minutes earlier than 8pm, which is when people were scheduled to begin
arriving.</p>

<p>I people watched a bit, skated around a bit (despite the no
bicycles, no skateboards, no skates sign (could this be the right
place, sporting such a sign?)) chilled out a bit.  Talked to two
people to make sure I was in the right place.</p>

<p>One person was John, a limosuine driver whose fare tonight was paid
by like 8 or 10 high school girls celebrating one of their birthdays.
The girls were all at the ice skating rink while I talked with John.
He used to ice skate, but has never inline skated.  His son can
snowboard (and does it well, according to his friends) so John may go
watch that sometime this season.</p>

<p>The girls all arrived, unfortunately all with long bread loaves
that they used like swords and littered across the pavement.  Not like
all of them, but 1.5 loaves were left on the ground.  I picked them up
and threw them away.</p>

<p>It began to rain around 8:30, so I figured that no one would come
skate with me.  I took off up Market the same sort of way as I had
come down it, but this time up the slight incline instead of down.</p>

<p>Around 8:45 it had stopped raining, and I headed back toward the
Embarcadero <em>just in case</em> someone else was there at 9.</p>

<p>Nope.</p>

<p>But!! Two trolley busses drove by, and people all over them were
all, "Merry Christmas!" and "Happy Holidays!" and singing Christmas
carols and good stuff like that.</p>

<p>I watched them go past and then realized this was my chance for
something fun to do tonight, so I caught up with them.  All the girls
in the back were all holding their hands out so I could give them
five, and then a couple people up front were so I moved to the front
of the bus to give them five as well.  While I watched their hands, I
couldn't watch the ground much; I'm so thankful that I didn't eat it
at that point, so early in our newfound game.</p>

<p>I found it relatively trivial to keep up with them, basking in the
girls flirting with me, "you're my hero!" ("aw thanks; you're my
heroes.. wait you're my cheer leaders!") and "how far are you going to
skate with us?" ("until I get bored or can't keep up") and "will you
go to Ghiradelli with us?"  ("Will you buy me chocolate?"  "Yes!"
"Whoohooo!  Chocolate!!!!") and "where are you from?" ("I'm from
Texas, Houston Texas.") and then, all in unison, "what's your name?"
and then the game ender, "how old are you?"</p>

<p>I changed my speed to visit the lead trolley, and they were all,
"do you have any requests [for Christmas Carols]?"  "Rudolph!!"  So
they sang Rudolph for me and I totally sang with them and did gestures
to represent the different parts of the song.  Totally thanked them
for blessing me with a song; it was so so great!</p>

<p>Stopped at an intersection where a bunch of open air restaurant
places teemed with people (maybe not teemed, but sported several staff
and customers) who all cheered when the trolley finished whatever song
they were on at the time.  One young boy inquired what I was doing and
I told him, "I'm skating along side of these trolleys while they sing
to me."  "Really?" he asked with large eyes.  "No actually," I looked
up at his dad, "but I like to pretend they are!"</p>

<p>Turned another corner and then headed up a pretty steep hill, two
blocks worth.  I basically kept up with the trolley on the first hill,
but was losing ground on the second hill.  Fortunately we turned and I
didn't have to haul butt up the hills.  I basked in lots of cheers and
kudos for having made it up the hill.</p>

<p>Then we turned and went 1 block and then down the same hill, one
block over.  I put on mad brakeage, and made it down the first hill
okay, but on the second one, I somehow screwed up and twisted and fell
<em>right beside the trolley</em> as it was moving.  I did a full 180
onto my butt and bounced my ass back up, simultaneously turned around
forwards again, made it the rest of the way down.</p>

<p>Some cheers, some jeers for that.  "You're still my hero!" ("thank
you!!") and "Not mine; you ate <em>shit</em> back there." ("yeah, but
did you see how quickly I bounced back up?  That's where it's at."  My
cheerleaders had boosted my ego enough to deflect the jeer a mile
away.)</p>

<p>We had arrived at Ghiradelli Square and several people said HI and
one cat came up to me, looking like Johnny the German exchange student
in OKC with dreads.  Looked also like Leif from Canada sorta.  His
name was Jake.  He asked if the Friday night skaters still skated each
Friday and I explained what I knew. ("yes, but apparently not tonight,
maybe cause of the rain")</p>

<p>A woman named Mary introduced herself as well.  Cute face and smile
with what I'll call a traditional fuzzy black Russian hat thing on.
Like a fuzzy top hat looking thing almost.</p>

<p>Ended up sitting between Jake and Mary, as our seats spilled off
the end of two small tables mushed together.  Jake and two of his
friends shared a sundae of eight scoops of ice cream, eight toppings,
and a pile of whipped cream.  Called an Earthquake.  They devoured it
in 15 minutes while Mary and I shared an excellent theological
discussion, started by me telling her I am a youth advisor, etc ("oh,
for what church?" etc)</p>

<p>I was impressed that she didn't seem to take "offense" at our lack
of a set creed, and even tried to summarize it in her own words.</p>

<p>I found it difficult to hear her in the din, but I got that she
believes ultimate sin exists with two results/causes: (wait, shit I'm
getting this wrong)  (!) God created the world with a bunch of set
laws and (@) The Fall (Adam and Eve's misadventures in Eden) keeps
people from being able to modify the laws that God has set.</p>

<p>My immediate question: "does that mean before The Fall that Adam
and Eve were able to modify the laws?" i.e. as Mary summarized, "that
they were equal with God?"  Exactly.  It was a question she hadn't yet
considered.</p>

<p>I'm glad to have given her some thought provoking questions.</p>

<p>With the Earthquake devoured, people started to leave from the
table.  Said bye to Jake (didn't get his email address), bye to Mary
(did get hers)</p>

<p>Bye to the matriarch and patriarch of the table (as introduced to
me by Mary, much to the chagrin of the mom) and thanked them for
having me join them, etc.</p>

<p>Several byes hollered a half block away once I got outside and the
original carolers saw me as they got into their van.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Now.  Where the fuck am I?</p>

<p>I finally found Ghiradelli on the map.  Fortunately I knew it was
close to the bay, so I just looked along that edge.  I had basically
gone 180 degrees around the circumfrence of the city.  I could either
retrace my trek and stay on quite small inclines, or bust up this
steeep ass hill right here and go straight back toward downtown.</p>

<p>Up the hill.</p>

<p>After a few particularly steep hills, I recognized I was at Hyde
and Lombard, right at the top of the proclaimed curviest street ever.
<em>No way am I going down that (and waste all my potential energy
after climbing this hill)...</em>, as I went past the street.</p>

<p>Then, <em>what am I saying?  this is my only chance to *skate* down
Lombard on a wet rainy night!</em> so I went back to skate down.</p>

<p>Oh shit this is steep.  And slick.  The road is paved with slick
red bricks.  Slick.</p>

<p>I can almost say I only fell once while going down the hill.  It
was more like I fell once or twice at every curve on the hill.  I was
basically sliding like Bambi on ice, on my kneepads and wristpads for
most of the time.  If I went down forward, I could see where I was
going, but my kneepads would slide down my leg, revealing skin for the
bricks to chew on.  If I slid backwards, the knees would be fine, but
I couldn't see where I was going.</p>

<p>So much fun!!!!</p>

<p>Exhilirated at the bottom.  <em>I just slid down Lombard!!!!!</em>
"Whoohooooooo!!" into the night sky.</p>

<p>Then I tried to skate <em>*up*</em> Lombard, but no.  Too slick.
Totally fruitless.  So I stepped up the steps on the left hand side of
the street going up.</p>

<p>Made it basically to Wende's apartment, kinda twisting my knees
trying to slow down enough going down the hills, then realized her
keys would be with her at her work.</p>

<p>I repeated my path to her work, and it seemed more dangerous this
time, and I can't really say why.  Was I just tired?  Same streets,
right?  Same amount of traffic, right?  hmmmm.</p>

<p>Got to her work, chilled outside a while, then she saw me and let
me in while they closed down all the registers and computers.</p>

<p>Walked (skated) Wende home and while crossing the large
city-sponsored lighted Christmas Tree, some cat was all, "you can't
skate up here (on this plaza thing)" So I was all, "I'm walking her
home.  Can I walk like this?" and made like I was walking in my skates
instead of rolling.  He allowed me to come across, just asked that I
go straight across and not fool around there.  No problem.</p>

<p>Got home and Wende made us some dinner of tomato, avacado, tortilla
chips, cheese.  So awesome!!!!  So thankful.</p>

<p>What a totally fantastic night!</p>
