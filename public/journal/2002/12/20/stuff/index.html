<p>Just so lazy and emotionally confused the past couple of days.
Wende and I watched <em>Lara Croft: Tomb Raider</em> on the first day
she had off from work (Wednesday) and then went to get some sushi from
the restaurant built into the bottom of her building.</p>

<p>I'm thankful for her paying; the prices were certainly higher than
I'm used to paying for dinner.  But I hopefully kept her entertained
by consuming more and more wasabi with every bite, until at the end my
eyes were all crying and sad.  In a funny way.</p>

<p>Did laundry after that.  Cost two dollars for each washer and $1.50
for each dryer.  Funny thing is that the back of the sushi kitchen is
20 feet down the hall from the laundry room.</p>

<p>Surprised me that there are exactly five washers and Wende filled
them all, and no one else tried to do laundry at the same time as us.
It's like, wow, do they have the perfect number of washers and dryers
for the building?  One of the dryers was apparently out of service
though; there are only four working.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Have been sorta poopypants lately, have had lots of dreams about
old school YRUUers.  Just last night Sean Murray was there again, and
something about Jason and a friend of his not from YRUU was in YRUU.
Something like that.</p>

<p>I can feel myself falling into old relationship patterns with
Wende.  She's got this cat named Tai (unlike her cats Peter and
Tinkerbell) that she's sorta but not really dating and has explicitly
told me that no kissing will happen between us (me an' Wende, not me
and Tai), and we've maintained that boundary.  I'm thankful for this;
it makes my life less confusing, if more frustrating.  I did ask her
on the first night I think, no on the second night if she would do my
back, which in our language means basically to preen me like monkeys
would, if they had tweezers to pull errant hairs and bobby pins to
extract blackheads from backs and ears.  This process is
simultaneously painful and comforting for me, especially in the ears
for that's one thing my mom used to do for me, back in the day.</p>

<p>Sally called last night, and after days of being cooped up inside
because of the rain and my addiction to internet LJs, AIM and such, I
went outside to talk with her, all loud and boistrous at times.  Far
louder than would be acceptable inside Wende's apartment at
11:30pm.</p>

<p>Sally and I yammered for an hour (and 7 minutes and 29 seconds,
according to my cellie).  Mostly she asked me about my latest
adventures and who I had gone to see (no one) and what I saw on the
way up here (lots) and how it's been chillin' with Wende (fine) and
what are my future plans (see Dude and Veronica for a couple days,
then try and get back to Dallas by 31 December), and as soon as I said
"try" to get back, my brain saw that as a word-fuck, as we would call
it in my men's group, for the phrase, "I'll try and call you.." -
that's a word fuck.  Either call me or don't call me.  But tell me
what you intend to do.  Or "let's try to do lunch sometime" .. man
just fuckin' get out the day planners and schedule a fucking lunch.
But then I basically allow myself to "try" and get back, because it's
a 37 hour trek (according to mapquest), plus I'm specifically on my
own vacation time.</p>

<p>So I left it at "I intend to get back by 31 December," which is
true, but because of the inherent challenges of driving 37 hours in a
week... shit I can make it.  Scott rocks; we will make it no problem.
Nevermind.  I'll be at that New Year's Eve Party.  You be there
too. (and you don't know who you are, for I'm not saying that to
anyone in particular)</p>

<p>I asked her about Rick and his surgery recovery, and about her
situation at work, to see if it's recovering as well.</p>

<p>Got a call from Jennifer a couple nights ago and am scheduled to
see her at 11am this morning to pick up the stuffed animal Sally left
there (she bought it at the same store/time that I bought the
mechanical Winnie the Pooh pencil for Wende) and chat or whatever.
When Sally and I were here last weekend, Jennifer said she and I
should hang out and then said something that hangs in my head like an
echo that my mind has been trying to take apart and decide what she
really meant, for she has a fiance and is going to leave today to see
him (though she certainly didn't predict that the only time I would
see her this time was on this last day that she would be here)
overseas though I'm wondering what she meant by, "I think you'll enjoy
how I treat you," or something like that for my mind went,
<em>what</em> when I heard it and played it over and over and took all
the words apart and put them back together even though it forgot which
ones they were and where they go in the sentence, as if I'm Mitch
Hedberg fixing a joke by taking all the words out and putting new ones
in.  Talk about a fucking obsession.  Blah.</p>

<p>Watched <em>Lara Croft</em> again last night, this time with the
English subtitles on to see if they match the actual spoken dialague.
They do, but infrequently words are left out of the subtitles, usually
not to the detriment of the viewer, but in one case, when Mr Pimms and
Mr Powell are leaving The Illuminati meeting after Mr Powell has just
assured the Illuminati that he's got everything handled, Mr Pimms goes
"We.. we don't have everything, do we?" or something like that, and Mr
Powell goes "No," in the movie, but not on the subtitles.  That's a
pretty significant word to leave out.  Not that it destroys the movie
without it, but certainly helps confirm the swindliness of Mr Powell
to include it.  After that, I watched the special effects, (and right
now as I'm typing I think I remember having already watched them at
Maggie and John's house back before they got divorced (I say that like
it was so long ago, which it really wasn't, though Maggie has moved
her life right along brilliantly and beautifully, blossoming herself
into a whole New Improved and Continually Improving Maggie)) which I
enjoyed pretty well, and then I watched the movie again, this time
with the Director's Commentary... and I realize why the average bear
might not have the ability to make such a movie as <em>Tomb
Raider</em> or at least has basically no idea what really goes into a
movie like that.</p>

<p>Officially I have been prim and proper on this trek to the west
side (Last night I found the picture of me sporting the Westside gang
symbol standing in front of the UCLA sign and laughed my ass off) and
since that's not quite true I'm going to hang out with Veronica (or
her friends) a bit more that I might have otherwise, hoping to get
this all resolved and ready to swim again.  The news has been somewhat
disruptive yet releasing as the truth shall set one free.  Buddha can
watch with detached amusement all our follies as we seek that ultimate
connection with God that seems so elusive.</p>

<p>Speaking of God, I enjoyed Ryan's idea of a book called WHY
CHRISTIANITY IS WRONG which he disclosed in discussion subsequent to
his posting an email he wrote to his mom after she sent him some
overtly Christian video message thing. I don't have the URL handy, but
look for mynameisryan from a couple days ago on livejournal.</p>

<p>Speaking of Ryan, I really hope he makes wads of cash with his
cartoon Boy In The Machine <a
href="https://boyinthemachine.tripod.com/">boyinthemachine.tripod.com</a>
I think.</p>

<p>"You can write 'Wende is the most perfect goddess angel in the
<em>whole world</em> and I'm <em>lucky</em> to be in her
presence.'" says Wende.</p>

<p>Going to take a shower now before I go to Jennifer's.</p>
