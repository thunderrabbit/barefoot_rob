                        <p class=date>1:06pm PST Friday 27 December 2002</p>

<p>Aight.  I'm leaving Newport Beach again.  I have plans to go north
to 40 and then east east east.  I have located Kinko's near the
freeway in Flagstaff Arizona, and Albuquerque New Mexico.</p>

<p class=date>1:19pm</p>

<p>Okay.  Map shows I can go north on 55, east on 19, north on 15 and
get to 40 up in the mountains at 2170 feet in Barstow.  Oh cool; I'll
be just east of Edwards Air Force Base!</p>

<p>4848.7 miles since Dallas.</p>

<p class=date>2:34pm</p>

<p>Crazy mad trash traffic getting out of Hell A.  Even wayout on the
east side on 15 it's packed (and then patches of not packed) .
(ISally calls it bipolar traffic._)</p>

<p class=date>3:10pm</p>

<p>4910 miles.  Argh traffic.  bluh</p>

<p class=date>3:11pm</p>

<p>4914 miles.  Finally out of traffic.  Hopefully.</p>

<p>Weird thing is that the speedy parts of trtaffic were and are
uphill.  The slow parts were downhill.  I don't really have a model to
explain that.</p>

<p class=date>3:28pm</p>

<p>Just crested a summit at 4190 feet.  4927 miles traveled.  Stopped
to exchange fluids.</p>

<p class=date>4:44pm</p>

<p>I made it to I-40 and it's quite sparsely populated compared to the
traffic on 15.  In the back of a truck in front of me, I saw a woman
who I think was signiing to others in the truck.  I never confirmed
this and she never looked back at me for me to ask in sign if she
signs.   Ah well.  They turned off before 40.</p>

<p>In other news, I'm getting better at "Rabbit Run," which I've been
practicing pretty consistently.  There are still some lyrics I can't
figure out, much less memorize, much less rap as fast as him, but it's
coming along.</p>

<p>I recently figured out that "new pad / drink a lid up / throw the
shit out" has got to be "new pad / crinkle it up / throw the shit
out."</p>

<p>I was like, "a lid?  what is he talking about?"</p>

<p class=date>5:01pm</p>

<p>5000 miles traveled on this adventure since Dallas.  I just watched
the zeroes turn over after consciously choosing not to stop at
Newberry Springs, a hot springs camp, clothing optional around the
camp, clothing prohibited in the pools.</p>

<p class=date>5:13pm</p>

<p>Driving into dusk, with the sun setting more to my right than
behind me, I seem to be in a large valley with a few hills in it, and
75%surrounded  by mountains, none of which seem to have snow on top,
so I'll just call them big sharp rocky hills.  Vegetation has been
lots of grasses in clumps and very few trees, almost no cacti.  Some
yucca.  Trees are about 15 feet tall, and more like bushes than
trees.  Some rocks sit patiently by the freeway, possibly waiting for
a ride, or just counting vehicles.  ("Let's play cont The Cars!"
"Okay!"  "There's a car.  There's a car!  There's a car!")</p>

<p>A single set of lines on telephone poles transmit energy or
information along the freeway.  No towers of any variety in sight.
Oh, there are two way out in front of me, with lights blinking.</p>

<p>5020 miles traveled.</p>

<p class=date>5:19pm</p>

<p>I'm a bit tired, and "next services 55 miles" sign got me to stop
here, wherever I am.</p>

<p>5026 miles.</p>
