<p>Good morninig London on our first full day to greet the city!  I will definitely be back here to visit.  Last night I talked to Sam, a kiwi (New Zealander) who has been living in London for  years I think, and if I understood correctly, will be applying for UK citizenship and a UK passport sometime soon.   I'm not sure how all hat works, but it seems with a UK passport, whe could more easily scoot around Europe.  She said she's homesick though.  she lives on the south Island of NZ.  There are three islands.  I don't remember all the details she gave.</p>

<p>I woke up and while collecting my clothes, etc to take a shower, Bryn  emerged down the stairs wit Tanja soon after.  We'll all be showered soon and embark on our day.</p>

<p>Oh, Sam heard that we'll be in Paris for 5 days, and she was like '5 days?  That's to much time; you'll get bored tehre!  You should got up to Belgium or ..' somewhere else, but I forgot where she suggested.  The funny thing is that she admitted she has never been to The Loure 'Or however you say it' she said.  I think we'll find enough to do!/p>

<p>What else....???   Um, so we are planning to see The Lion King tonight, and to scope out the Lodon Eye (huge ferris wheel), and London Tower, and Big Ben today.   Turns out Big Ben is the name of the bell in the tower that I have come to associate with the name Big Ben.  I thought it was the whole tower, or the clock t least, but it's just the bell.  Just a huge ass bell, but you know.</p>

<p>I have expressed interest in seeing Stonehenge, and Graham suggested that I rent a car (they call it hire a car, I think) and drive my ass out there for a two day trip and check out a couple of other sites and stay at a B&B.  I'm pretty open to this idea, but a bit nervous about driving in Lonndon proper.  I will likely be more comfortablew with the idea in a couple days, so I may do this.</p>

<p>Bryn will be staying the night at Richmond University on Monday night I thinnk, so I may do it on Monday and Tuesday.</p>

<p>My left shoulder has an amazing kink in it.</p>
