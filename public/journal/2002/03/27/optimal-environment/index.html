<p>This is my optimal environment, or aspects of environment that I would
love and feel energized living within.</p>

<p>My bedroom is only accessible via a ladder or a rope swing, and a
small portal of some sort.  The hand holds are just the right size for
me to use.  Any guests have to be determined to enter before they'll
be willing to go to such extremes.</p>

<p>In my room there is no phone unless I take my cell pone with me.</p>

<p>Outside there are craggy bluffs and a hill or valley, with bushes and cacti
and trees to climb.  Big open area to play frisbee, open enough to throw, if
not open enough to run and catch it.</p>

<p>Wind blows friskily through the trees an around the bluffs, allowing for fun
lofting frisbee games.</p>

<p>My house has paints and brushes on one wall, and people are invited to
create art on it.  One other wall is left only for me to create upon.  The
guest art wall is photographed and thereby archived when it gets full, then
is repainted white or some silly sponge yellow or light gray.</p>

<p>Windows have stained glass art in them.  Maybe it's fake stained glass, just
painted.  yes; I need some of that.</p>

<p>One other wall has a water fountain built in, with tubes that people can
move around to bring water to the top, and make different configurations of
splashable water cascading pools on the way down.</p>

<p>This might have to be outside.</p>

<p>The doors are often open, and always unlocked.  My bike is attached
to the wall, ready to roll at any minute.  As well as my skates and
frisbee, a hackey sack, and kite maybe.  There is a room for crafts,
which always has a project ongoing.  paper clock is finished and on
the wall.  Marble track has its own table.  Other random projects are
around.</p>

<p>healthy snacky food is available from everywhere.  something I can
just snack on indefinitely.  and water is close at hand as well.  fish
tank built into one wall, maintained by my fish tank maintainer, not
me.</p>

<p>one room has books and beanbags in it.  and pillows.</p>
