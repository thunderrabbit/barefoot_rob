<p>We've been totally fun throughout the day today - after fish and chips at Garfunkle's bar we had quite an adventure getting train tickets for Tanja so she could ride the same train as Bryn and I.</p>

<p>Bryn, we're in London!</p>

<p>Free internet terminals in te airport, but I resisted the temptation to check email and write an entry.  50p for fifteen minutes at a different terminal, so I didn't even consider it.</p>

<p>Cool thing to step out of the train station and see that the area we were in <em>used</em> to be outisde, but has had a big ass roof built over the whole operation.  All the storefronts were outdoor brickwork like the mall i OZ Daimaru or something.  I didn't take picutres inside except for the pic of the Sock Shop for Wende.</p>

<p>London seems cold and overcast and perpetually wet, so I love the humidity level, but it's too cold for my taste.</p>

<p>Met up with Graham and went rief shopping with him in the little neighborhood stores,news agency, chemist, grocery, etc etc etc.</p>

<p>We only went to two stores, and I stopped by the news agency to get post cards to begin writing.</p>

<p>Walked to Graham's house, which is more like a coop, with a bunch of people living here all doing their own thing.</p>

<p>Plyed some ping pong and then some cats were all, 'you wana go to the pub?' and we're all, um, uh, maybe, and then they were all, 'we've got a van right here; we're leaving now.'   'Okay'</p>

<p>So we put on shoes and walked outside to the van, a normal enough van in the front, and in the back, a bunch of lawn mowing equipment, covered in water and bits of grass.</p>

<p>What a fabulous grand adventure!  I almost busted my ass one time but then found a pretty secure way to hang on.  Lots of laughing, not knowing where we were headied, no windows, hanging on, light flashing, looking out the tiny pinholes to see random signage that was way far from where we had started.</p>

<p>Arrived at the pub and played about 5 games of billiards, but the difference is that instead of stripes and solids, they have just two different colors of balls.</p>

<p>to be continued<p class=date>12:59 am houston time</p></p>

<p>Bryn and I have been sleeping for a bit, like a small puppy pile at a rally.</p>

<p>Thing is, the seats are tilted back, but the arm rests don't go as far back.  So one thing that is relatively comfortable puts the pillow against the raised arm rest.</p>

<p>It's apparently 7am London time now.  I'm going to sleep a bit more; we have a bit under 3 hours of flight time left.</p>

<p class=date>2:48 am = 8:48am</p>

<p>breakfast now on the plane.  There is snow outside on the ground.</p>

<p class=date>12:30 pm 15-3-02</p>

<p>We waited for quite a while but never saw her.  Finally decided to go upstairs to look and found her immediately.  Now we are at Garfunkel's Bar and Restaurant to eat fish and chips.</p>

<p class=date>8:25 pm 15-3-02</p>

<p>Um, so two different colors of balls, and the balls and tables are 2/3rds the size of ours.</p>

<p>I was on a team with Doors (girl from NZ), and Bryn & Graham, and Tanja & Drew</p>

<p> Drew is far better than the rest of us, but Doors and I won 3 games in a row, two of which we won because the other team sank the 8 ball or other tchnicalities.  Oh, and they ae an 8 ball along with the 2 sets of 7 colored balls.</p>

<p>Walked back home because the van had left early.  Stopped by a bottle store to get some drinks.</p>

<p class=date>8:36 pm</p>

<p>Now we are back at the co-op house and Drew is challenging Matt at ping pong with 10 pounds each on the table.  est of 5 games.  Drew is winning 2 games to 1, and in this fourth game, his is winning 7 to 4.</p>

<p>Now it's 10 to 10.</p>

<p class=date>8:42 pm</p>

<p>20 to 20.  And Matt won  24 to 22.</p>

<p>So now it's 13 13 in the final game.  2 to 2 games..  22 to 20 Matt wins.!   Very close games.</p>
