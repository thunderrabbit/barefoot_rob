<ol>
<li>My old thunderrabbit router conked out so now we are using a new one
with three antennas and mutiple channels and all that good stuff.</li>
<li>The conking coincided with new printer disallowing login so I reset
the networking and therefore lost the few scan-to-ssh profiles I
had set up.  I have half of them restored and a few new ones
planned.</li>
<li>This allows me to scan A4 pages and upload to my b.robnugen.com
server (b stands for binary).  Most of them are going to be in
<a href="https://b.robnugen.com/robot/">https://b.robnugen.com/robot/</a> (where robot represents for R.O.B.O.T., which
stands for my personal <a href="https://wiki.robnugen.com/wiki/Category:R.O.B.O.T.">religion I made</a> after reading
<a href="https://archive.org/details/shavinginsideofy00ashm">Shaving the Inside of your Skull</a>
by Mel Ash) whereas others will be in other directories</li>
<li>I have started writing my dreams and scanning them to
<a href="https://b.robnugen.com/journal/2019/dreams/">https://b.robnugen.com/journal/2019/dreams/</a> In the future I hope to
have an automagic way to display thumbnails, allow paging through
the images, transcribing them, and naming the files nicely.</li>
<li>For now, the filenames created by the scanner include date, name,
topic, and a counter which shows the order in which they were
scanned.</li>
<li>I recently discovered I apparently applied to JB in October 2014 (I
think)</li>
<li>I have recently scheduled two (2) workshops. Oh snap I should
invite people to them.</li>
<li>August 17th <a href="Eye
Gazing Workshop">https://www.facebook.com/events/2465227863708851/</a>, which will allow people to really connect deeply
to themselves and others in a safe heart-filled space</li>
<li>The next workshop is scheduled for September 7th, a
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2054284838201319/">past life memories workshop</a>.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s been several days since I started item 9 above, and I just
finished it by adding the link.</li>
<li>The past several days have been filled with working on AB.  I am
pretty close to having a migration path to get them onto RDS with
almost no downtime.  After that will be to have their web server
deployable via script.  Thank you Travis for having introduced me
to Ansible some years ago.</li>
<li>Rainy season has finished so now it&rsquo;s typhoon season. wait, what?</li>
<li>11 people are signed up for the workshop on Saturday.  I&rsquo;m super
looking forward to having a great experience with everyone.</li>
<li>I got
<a href="https://b.robnugen.com/robot/templates/2019/R.O.B.O.T._Daily_Pages_version_2019_Aug_14.pdf">my Daily ROBOT page</a>
fixed enough that I am thinking of taking the time to make an HTML
version so I can track its history.  I used
<a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">Libre Office</a> to make the PDF so I
wouldn&rsquo;t have to muck with CSS, etc.  But now I want to make a
clean CSS version.  Possible?  Nah forget it.  PDF versions are
fine for now.</li>
<li>Our cat Jennie is doing fine.  She sleeps like a log instead of a
bun because it&rsquo;s summer.</li>
<li>Just yesterday or so I started listening to my CDs from
<a href="https://www.monroeinstitute.org/">The Monroe Institute</a> which I
bought after taking the week long
<a href="https://www.monroeinstitute.org/Gateway%20Voyage%20Program">Gateway Voyage</a>
back in 1996 or 1997. It still works!</li>
<li>Marble Track 3 most recently got the Lower Zig Zag 3ban Lower
Support, and the Lowest Largest U-turn Berm glued into place.  I
plan to work on it a bit more today.</li>
