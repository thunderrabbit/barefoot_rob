<h5 id="21-46-sunday-03-march-2019-jst">21:46 Sunday 03 March 2019 JST</h5>

<ol>
<li>I will be traveling to the US for 22 days starting March 13th.</li>
<li>Not packed yet, but have it planned for next week.</li>

<li><p>I have just sent a list of workshops to Tokyo Men&rsquo;s Circle</p>

<p>Men, my stretch was to find workshops that we can do in Tokyo.</p>

<p>I have led #1 and #3 below.  As a group, we did #2 in August 2018
for ourselves, and then again in November 2018 for new men.</p>

<p>#4 can be done online, once a week for 5 to 7 weeks (2 hours per
 week).  This would require some coordination and a trainer from
 the US to help me lead.  I judge it would take a committment from
 6 men to make it worthwhile.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Head Heart and Soul is a 2 hour introduction to the work.  Men
and women can attend.</p></li>

<li><p>Circle of Men, Journey of the Heart is a day long experiential
personal growth workshop.  Men only, but could probably work
for women.  (6-7 hours, including lunch)</p></li>

<li><p>Life Mission workshop lets each man to discover his life’s
Mission, and actions which he can use to bring his mission
present in his life.  This can easily be done in 2 hours.</p></li>

<li><p>Circle Skills training for the classic archetypal MKP-style
integration circle (this gives a solid framework for sitting in
circle)</p></li>
</ol></li>

<li><p>I got a new battery, but it has not worked right.  I understand now I
need to disable sleep mode and let it reallllly run out all the
way.  Dangit.</p></li>

<li><p>Marble Track 3 has over 300 hours of livestream of me making it.</p></li>

<li><p>I probably will not mess with the website for a bit, but the idea
of making it better is tempting.</p></li>

<li><p>The website is at version 2, mostly purple and made by Sanjay and
team in Deli, India.</p></li>

<li><p>The GoFundMe has made $4000+ which more than covers the tickets for my
trip.  We need to set up a company here to keep track of
everything.</p></li>

<li><p>That means I need to start collecting receipts, cause they are
getting pricey!</p></li>

<li><p>I had a killer headache this past Monday from too much
computering, I think.  I can feel another coming on, but I will
head to be soon.</p></li>

<li><p>I am shutting my computer down now/soon and will let the battery run alll the way down</p></li>

<li><p>I think I have a way to fix ConSwi without relying on physics to
keep bricks from going through each other.</p></li>

<li><p>I wanted to work on it today, but did lots of MKP stuff</p></li>
