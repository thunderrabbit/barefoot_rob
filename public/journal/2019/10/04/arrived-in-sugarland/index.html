<p>Ma and I chatted while waiting for Nico to arrive and clear customs.
Fun chatting with her and nearly finished solving the latest NYT
crossword puzzle.  I can see how it would be a good way to keep the
ol&rsquo; left brain sharp.</p>

<p>I chatted with the nice driver of the shuttle bus as she drove us to
the IAH parking lot a couple miles away from the airport.  I asked if
she could drive us to Sugarland (an hour away), and she said, &ldquo;just
let me get some gas first..&rdquo;  I love that quick wit!</p>

<p>Ma drove us to Sugarland via Google Maps and then drove us to the
grocery store 600 meters away before heading on her weekend adventure.</p>

<p>Nico and I bought food at the grocery and went through the self
checkout lanes and chatted with the clerk there who had no other
customers.  &ldquo;Are you busy??&rdquo; I jokingly asked her.  I asked her for
the codes on various produce I had bought, but all the items were to
be scanned!  I was like, &ldquo;you kids have it so easy!  When I was a boy
we had to memorize all the codes&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the end, I was like, &ldquo;where&rsquo;s the discount button?&rdquo; and she said
there wasn&rsquo;t one, but if I had a Kroger card, I would get a discount.
Sweet!  Aw man I should have used my card with Nico&rsquo;s checkout as
well; I don&rsquo;t think he got one.</p>

<p>On the way out of the parking lot, I said HI to a woman locking up a nail
salon shop.  I ran up to her, &ldquo;oh please just one more customer??&rdquo; and
she laughed saying she had just come back to get her back pack.</p>

<p>I love that I can banter with clerks here so easily.  Cannot often do
it in Tokyo.</p>

<p>Walked back to the house and now in my own room, with own adjacent bath!</p>
