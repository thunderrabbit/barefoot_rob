                        <p>##10:17 Saturday 02 March 2013</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve misplaced my template for writing States of My Life Addresses.</p>

<p>Work has been my main focus for a while; Mondays through Fridays I wake up usually at 7:30am, do a backup of the AB database, leave for work at 8; arrive at work at 9,  eat my lunch that Lin made, work + read hacker news, buy a drink and snack around 4pm, leave at 6pm, meet Lin at Shinagawa station or at home, eat dinner, hang out, shower, sleep.</p>

<p>Variants of the M-F schedule include mediation in the morning, recently for 30 minutes.  I am &ldquo;soon&rdquo; going to make a simple app to be a meditation timer.  I have a name selected, but haven&rsquo;t secured it with Apple (did you know that all the apps in the Apple App Store have distinct names?) and I don&rsquo;t want the hordes of people who read my journal to hoard my good name idea.   haha anyway, I plan to make the app source code available on github, my first open source project of any magnitude.  But yes, for now it&rsquo;s vaporware.   (And yes, I know there are many meditation timers, but none of <em>the</em> feature that I want.)</p>

<p>Lin and I have been married for, um,.. a year and a half.  It&rsquo;s a bit confusing to me because our official marriage date of 4 July 2011 differs from  30 December 2011, our wedding date in Houston, by nearly 6 months, plus I have to do some thinkin&rsquo; to figure out the year, etc etc..  So we&rsquo;ve been married for a bit, and are still in the honeymoon stage of lovey dovey, ooey gooey, kissey kissy, happy sappy relationship, which I&rsquo;m quite enjoying.</p>

<p>We have our fair share of fights when I&rsquo;m an asshole, complaining about what she does, and, fortunately, she&rsquo;ll tell me straight up, &ldquo;yo!&rdquo; and we get it sorted pretty quickly.  I&rsquo;m certain that ability to get the shit out will continue to benefit us.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve got a long-term plan to move to Taiwan, &ldquo;in 3 years,&rdquo; but no real date set.  Lin&rsquo;s mom is welcome to join, but appears that she will choose to stay close to her existing grandkids.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s crappy cold today.  Living up on the 13th floor, overlooking a relatively wide plain including a river and nothing much to hinder the wind, we can hear the whissing sound in the window, sometimes continuously.   My weather data says it&rsquo;s 8C now in Tokyo.   Wednesday and Thursday were a bit warmer than other recent days.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also been working with Tariq on our next app, and recently got some advice from Matt who has organized the iOS meetups in Tokyo for the past long while.  Matt suggested replacing the ivars with properties, and I was like, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s an ivar?&rdquo; and I forgot what it stands for, but it means the variables declared inside the private implementation instead of the private interface.   (I think I have used many of the correct words here)</p>

<p>The app works on my devices, and on my simulators, but crashes on Tariq&rsquo;s iPad mini, but I haven&rsquo;t figured out why.  We think it might be his device; it can&rsquo;t play some other games, so we&rsquo;re going to continue development with the hope/belief that it will all be okay for the vast majority of iDevices.</p>

<p>At work, the app we made for a client was rejected because it gives &ldquo;discounts to physical goods or services,&rdquo; which it&rsquo;s been doing for years.  Now suddenly they reject it for that reason.  I&rsquo;ve been getting less and less impressed with Apple to the point that I&rsquo;ve stated that I&rsquo;ve purchased my last Apple device.  My plan is to put linux on this iMac when it&rsquo;s no longer strong enough to support the latest OS X in a couple years.  Then once this computer bites the big one, I&rsquo;ll buy a Chromebook or something.   We&rsquo;ll see how long this plan lasts.</p>

<p>So it&rsquo;s because &ldquo;not much is happening&rdquo; that I haven&rsquo;t really been writing in my journal.  It&rsquo;s just the same old boring stuff day after day.  I&rsquo;ve considered removing &ldquo;Keep Pushing The Limits&rdquo; from my journal; I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve kept pushing the limits at all.</p>

<p>Welllll as I write this, I remember my same old boring daily routine does <em>not</em> include wearing shoes; I&rsquo;m approaching my 1 year anniversary of being barefoot in Japan, and it looks like I&rsquo;ve made it through the winter, being shod only on the days that it snowed, or when it was less than ~5C and rainy.</p>

<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve been unsubscribing from almost every email list I&rsquo;ve been on over the years.  I stopped reading them, so am stopping subscriptions.  That&rsquo;s my first step in taking control of my inbox again.  There are now 307 unread messages, and 963 messages in my inbox.</p>

<p>breakfast time! whoooo  cornbread is done!</p>
