                        <p>##07:12 Sunday 13 January 2013</p>

<p><em>With peeps from PB, walking along a seashore at the bottom of a relatively steep rocky face, not steep enough to be a cliff, but about 60 degree descent, but upon which were many people sitting enjoying the water, including families and dogs and kids, we were at the top , and I had been sweeping sweeping inside the house, debris had collected from the night before as the garage door was ajar (from the bottom) and pine needles had been blown in. I was sweeping them, enjoying the meditative experience of just sweeping and cleaning, and the debris got a bit bigger until I was sweeping pebbles and then I was on the beach, sweeping rocky pebbles and then proper rocks.</em></p>

<p><em>A friend was helping me clean up and went to pick up a styrofoam mountain as from an HO train set, but it was a real one used by the natives as a sacred site; I was like, &ldquo;are you sure you want to remove that? and he was like, &ldquo;nah&rdquo; and left it, but then I was like, &ldquo;well it&rsquo;s okay, and I swept it as Carissa was saying &ldquo;we have volcanoes in Sioux Hills,&rdquo; and I was like, &ldquo;really?&rdquo; and she goes, I told you last night! I was like, &ldquo;oh yeah, but then I was like, &ldquo;oh no you didn&rsquo;t you said you had them in Iowa, not in Sioux Hills,&rdquo; and she was like, &ldquo;I said 10, not nine,&rdquo; and I said, &ldquo;I said &lsquo;Iowa&rsquo;, not &lsquo;nine&rsquo;&rdquo; and she was like, &ldquo;I said, &lsquo;ten&rsquo;&rdquo; and I go, &ldquo;okay forget it&rdquo; as lava had started to trickle out of the hole beneath the space where the styrofoam mountain had been. I watched for a bit and the lava began to pour out in a thin stream, straight toward the rocky face upon which hundreds of people were relaxing facing the water.</em></p>

<p><em>I began to shout, &ldquo;lava!!!!&rdquo; as loudly as I&rsquo;d shout &ldquo;shark&rdquo; if there was one, as the lava was streaming its 1000 degree self straight down the mountain, right between lots of people, and kids were walking around clueless and then one stepped in it and was like &ldquo;kyaaaaah&rdquo; as it burned him and a guy touched it, all while I was shouting &ldquo;lava!!&rdquo; as loud as I could and then another, larger stream of lava started to come sideways along the beach but not pouring down until it got to my little stream, which was now a big stream, and the scene shifted to us all escaping the lava on a train, but it had lava trickling down the middle of it and as people were getting off the train, I was like, &ldquo;watch the lava, don&rsquo;t step in it, okay watch the lava..&rdquo; and people were cluelessly stepping in it and just over it without looking, and then I was like, &ldquo;HEY&rdquo; right in the face of a woman with kids, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s LAVA on the floor right here&rdquo; but as I was saying that, her kids didn&rsquo;t stop and were walking right over it, and I was like, &ldquo;sorry to yell&rdquo; but then I saw her kids and the next family not stopping and then walking over it, and in it, and I was like omg this is useless and started asking people to help me build a human wall to help keep people away from the lava as they just kept coming in without paying attention to anything and without a clue was to what was going on.</em></p>

<p>I wrote the above into <a href="https://750words.com">750words.com</a>. Here is its <a href="https://750words.com/entries/share/2339071">analysis of the text in the entry above</a>, plus some padding I wrote to pad out the 584 words above.</p>
