                        <p>##05:21 Monday 28 January 2013</p>

<p><em>Dusk was approaching on a rainy night and we got a knock at the door. I opened it and a western looking guy wearing a backpack introduced himself. &ldquo;HI; I&rsquo;m Joe from Nagano,&rdquo; and I interrupted him, &ldquo;you came from Nagano??&rdquo; &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. &ldquo;Okay sorry please continue..&rdquo; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m was working in IT there but lost my job so I&rsquo;m looking for IT work in Tokyo..&rdquo; He was dripping a bit with rain, so I offered him to come in. He stepped up onto the wooden entry and I said &ldquo;shoes off outside, please&rdquo; and he stepped back outside. I then said &ldquo;wait. I don&rsquo;t personally have work for you, but I have a contact who might. You look cold, so I&rsquo;m offering to give you a warm place to sleep for tonight, BUT there is still some light outside; you can push on and maybe find a job, or you can come inside; it will be dark in about 30 minutes; you can come back after visiting a couple more houses.</em></p>

<p>He considered the options for a minute and then came inside. I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Rob and this is Sabina,&rdquo; as Sabina came up to see the visitor. She&rsquo;s traveling as well so may be able to give a few tips on making money in Japan.
Sabina started asking him questions animatedly, and they hit it off right away. She took him into her room and closed the door; I could hear them talking as I started doing dishes, washing a large tray with a painted tree on it, actually a large tree in a forest of trees, with lots of green deep green with some of the paint chipping off. I started to scrape more paint off while washing and thought I should have gotten back in touch with Sabina sooner because now she&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;m just getting back to her because she has a new friend and she&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;m jealous. But really I&rsquo;ve wanted to get back in touch the whole time but just didn&rsquo;t know what to say. So I made a decision to talk to her as soon as possible when she came back out of her room and then I woke up.</p>
