<p><p>Jodi and I went alone to House of Pies.  We requested the &ldquo;first
Pauline table&rdquo; Pauline is the incredibly pretty short blonde waitress
with cool earrings and cool haircut.  Oh- her nametag says Pauline,
but her name is actually Angela.  We at $10.50 worth of stuff and I
gave her at $10.50 tip.  Dude.  A perfect 100% tip.  Molly asked me to
leave her a big tip.  So I did.  Before we left, I made sure she knew
what group I represented.  Cool.  I may do it again sometime later.
She was having &ldquo;one of those nights.&rdquo;  She gave me a chocolate shake
instead of vanilla, but I didn&rsquo;t worry about it.  We talked fro a
little bit at the end- she thought our group was from Rice, but I told
her what was correct.  I&rsquo;ve basically screwed up the whole account of
the night.  But oh well.  At the end she knew what group we
represented and she said that she was really sorry to have missed our
last night at House of Pies.  I told her not to worry about it too
much.  We&rsquo;ll be back.</p>

<p><p>Today I worked 10 hours at the pharmacy for the last time.
(hopefully) Cool.  (Emilio should be back Monday) I will like my
paycheck at least.</p>

<p><p>Today Fred went to the Oklahoma All Souls church Rally.  Cool.  He
is probably in route right now.  I called Heather after work today and
talked to her for a couple hours.  Dude.  I really enjoyed it and I
told her so.  She is super wonderful.  Man I am so tired.  Later</p>
