<p><p class=date>Saturday, June 6, 1992 10:39 PM.</p>

<p><p>I slept in today and rolled around in bed for hours and did nothing
until I had to work at Kroger at noon.  At first I was groucy, but
then Roy started sacking for me and I picked on him a lot, so I felt
better.  A guy came in and bought a lottery ticket.  Roy knew him
since he used to work there, so we were all talking and stuff and he
bought the lottery ticket.  I asked if he wanted to choose the one he
wanted, but he had me choose instead.  I laid them out on the counter
and chose one.  It was a 2 dollar winner.  Cool.  Roy almost had a
heart attack right there because he wanted to know &ldquo;how&rsquo;d you do that,
Rob?&rdquo;  I just laughed at him.  He&rsquo;s so funny..  Then a second later,
the guy came back and gave me a dollar, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s your share.&rdquo;  Dude.
That was great&hellip; Roy got so upset and I just cracked up.</p>

<p><p>Later today, I was checkin at a register right behind Quina, the
beautiful girl who won&rsquo;t give me her phone number.  I heard this whump
and saw something go flying.  I thought someone had thrown something.
Then I looked at Quina, who was holding an opened can of biscuits!
Then I looked at my register, and one had landed flat splat on my
counter!  I died laughing.  Quina looked so embarassed.  I loved it.</p>

<p><p>After work, I went to Soundwaves and bought 4 used CD&rsquo;s, and 1 New
CD.  Used: Cyndi Lauper, <em>She&rsquo;s So Unusual</em> for the song &ldquo;All
through the Night&rdquo;, Big Audio Dynamite II, <em>The Globe</em> for &ldquo;The
Globe&rdquo;, Enigma, <em>MCMXC a.D.</em> for the song &ldquo;Sadness Part 1&rdquo;, and
Crunch 0 Matic, <em>Caution: D0 N0t Play</em> for the title.
Literally I bought it because it said &ldquo;Do not Play.&rdquo;  Reverse
psychology got me.  Unfortunately, the whole album is stupid, so I&rsquo;m
going to take it back.  I also bought a new CD by Tori Amos,
<em>Little Earthquakes</em> for the song &ldquo;Silent all these years.&rdquo;
I&rsquo;m currently listening to Enigma&hellip;..  Dude.  It&rsquo;s on track 7: way
spaced out single drum beats and the 5 tones from Close Encounters
played on xylophone maybe.  Pretty cool.  Well, enough mistakes for
the page.  Later.</p>
