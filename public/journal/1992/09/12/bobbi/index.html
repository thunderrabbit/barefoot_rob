                        <p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>2AM, Saturday 12 September 1992</p>

<p>Today after school, Molly, Laura & I went to Target.  On the way,
we stopped by Cougar Place to pick up Cindy, Marcel's old girlfriend.
While I was helping Cindy put a box in the trunk, Molly shouted, "Rob!
Look ahead!"  It was Bobbi.  It was Bobbi walking up. "Bobbi!" I
called.  She didn't seem to notice me. I couldn't figure out what to
say; I was entranced by her braces.  Suddenly, she was walking away.
What do I do?  Then Molly asked her "Where are you staying?"  "cougar
Place.  Not officially."  Then she was gone.</p>

<p>After Target, I talked to Molly about what I should do the next time I see her.  We decided I should say "HI Bobbi.  How's everything?  You
remember- we met outside of Bates on the second day of school.  Yup Yes Sure Well, I just want to follow you around."</p>

<p>At about 9PM, I was leaving the dorm, and I saw Carrie at the OB desk, so I sat and talked to her until 12AM.  She knows Bobbi well, but said I
should be cautious because she is "unstable."</p>

<p>Carrie use to live in Memorial Chase.  Amazing.  We drew a map and compared stories about old times that we actually never shared.  Carrie totally
likes me, but she smokes.  My policy is that I won't kiss girls who smoke. - - -</p>

<p>At midnight, Judy replaced Carrie at the desk, so Carrie and I went for a walk.  I told Carrie that I didn't have to go out with Bobbi, but that I
just want to kiss her.  I am willing to just be straight forward with Bobbi and say, "I have a braces fetish.  I want to kiss you."  Carrie said Bobbi
would laugh and then say, "OK," and kiss me.  Bobbi would also be flattered, she said...</p>

<p>Carrie and I played and splashed each other in the wading fountain.  Then I lay on top of the big fan thing and dried off somewhat.  Then we played
frisbee a little, and then she gave me a great back massage.  I would have kissed her, but she smokes.  At the end of the night I gave her a good hug, though.</p>
