                        <p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>3:30AM Friday 18 September 1992</p>

<p>Today before school Linda called and said she had a hangover and couldn't come today.</p>

<p>So I went to 104 KRBE &amp; got my 104 Card.  After school, I used it to get Red Hot Chili Peppers' Blood Sugar Sex Magik for $8.99.  Cool.</p>

<p>Then I got a copy of Molly's dorm key made.  It was no sweat.  I just taped the imprinted, "Duplication Prohibited" and took it to the key shop
outside of Sears.  He said, "This type of key will run you $2.99"  Cool.</p>

<p>Then I spent some time just walking around campus with only my frisbee.  "Today" was my day off from homework, so I can do that sort of thing on
Thursdays.  So I walked to Cougar Place and got the phone number of Sarah Pagione (sp), with whom Bobbi-with-braces is staying. It's ext 7299 =
743-7299.  <b>7729</b></p>

<p>Then I walked to the library and talked to Yolanda Washington for a while.  Then I cruised to my class (AI) and then to Molly's to watch the
Simpsons and then to the VAX to chat via internet with Laura Wallace in Chicago, and then to the dorms and we (Molly, Laura, me, Debbie Forester,
Anna Beth (her roommate), Will Smith, Greg Titus, &amp; Kim (his girlfriend) with to Marble Slab.  Molly drove, Laura Shotgun, Greg &amp; Kim in the
trunk and the 4 of us in back seat.  We at at Marble Slab, and I flirted with Tammy, (not Nerenberg) who was working there.   I had her turn 104 on
the radio.  She did, and "Get Ready for This" by 2 Unlimited came on.  Cool!  so she turned it up for me and I loved it.  I told her this song could
not be played loud enough.  Unfortunately, Tammy's boss or supervisor thought it was too loud, so she turned it down.</p>

<p>Tammy stuck her tongue out at her.  Heh heh.  Then I found out Tammy's name and told her mine just before we left.</p>

<p>On the way back, <b>I</b> rode with Kim in the trunk.  She expressed some discomfort with Greg being too religious.  I told her I'm not at all
religious.  She said the same about herself.  So we kinda cuddled and flirted and i invited her to rest her head on my shoulder, which she did.  Cool.</p>

<p>I held/caressed her leg with my right hand and held/caressed her fingers with my left hand.  At the end of the right I thanked her and we agreed it
was enjoyable.  When we got out, it was back to ignore Rob &amp; hang on Greg.</p>

<p>We went to Molly &amp; Laura's &amp; played cards &amp; Jeanine came over so I flirted with her and told her I was really horny.  She said she had
to do homework though.  Crud.</p>

<p>We played cards until 2:AM when I conked out on Molly's bed &amp; they continued playing until about 2:20 AM.  Molly elected me to take Will home,
but I convinced him to just sleep on their bean bag.</p>

<p>On the way out, I met Fred, who was walking from lot 9 after getting home from Tomball, feeding the animals.  We talked about girls &amp; cop car
stories (<a href="https://robnugen.com/cgi-bin/journal.pl?type=all&date=1992/08/28#Heather">page 160</a>) &amp; talked about nothing..</p>

<p>We talked until 2 pretty girls walked by &amp; I said "Good Morning."  They told us it was "3 on the dot."  So we cruised to bed.  Here I am.
3:55AM Friday 18 Sept 1992</p>
