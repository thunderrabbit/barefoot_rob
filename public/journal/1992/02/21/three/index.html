                        <p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)</p>

<p class=date>Thursday, February 21, 1992 11:59PM</p>

<p><p>Today 3 things:</p>

<p><ol>
<li><p>During physics I wrote a little note for Maggie.  I said, &ldquo;I
want to take you to Enchanted Rock and walk around and everything.&rdquo;
(I wanted to put &lsquo;and make out&rsquo; instead of &ldquo;and everything,&rdquo; but I
didn&rsquo;t.)  She wrote back, &ldquo;What brings this on?&rdquo;  I said, &ldquo;Honestly
and bluntly, and I know there&rsquo;s nothing you can or want to do about
it, but I&rsquo;m jealous of John.&rdquo; (John her boyfriend) She wrote back, &ldquo;I
think we need to talk about this.&rdquo;  We didn&rsquo;t get a chance to, but we
will someday.</p>

<p><li><p>After physics, Maggie, Heather and I went to Lynn Eusan Park,
where they had lots of stands set up with different games.  The 3 of
us competed in The Family Feud game.  I had no shoes on (as usual for
the past 2 weeks) so we called ourselves the 4 shoes.  We didn&rsquo;t win,
but it was quite fun.  The other cool thing was that I was wearing my
glasses, but it didn&rsquo;t affect anyone else.  Surprise surprise&hellip; I
still acted funny and loud and flirty and got just as many laughs,
etc. as with my contacts&hellip; Then Maggie Laura and I went to
Kroger. Then we watched the Simpsons and then Laura and I went out.</p>

<p><li><p>Laura and I were going to talk about our relationship I had
thought, but she thought we were going to talk about ourselves, so
that&rsquo;s what we did.  Oh well.  I had wanted to tell her that I don&rsquo;t
really want a big relationship with her if she&rsquo;s going to have a
negative, worrysome attitude.  I dealt with Tammy&rsquo;s similar attitude
and I don&rsquo;t want to again.</p>

<p><li><p>As I left, I met Jeanine.  We hugged and talked for a few
minutes.  We both needed a hug. Tomorrow, she&rsquo;s going to put $5.00 for
me on a horse with a 2 word, 3 syllable name.  Later</p>
