                        <p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)</p>

<p class=date>6PM, Sunday afternoon, March 8, 1992</p>

<p>After school and work on Friday, I went back to the school since
they were having the Cougar Preview.  At 9:30PM we went to the ice
cream social.  We located Fred, so he was there.  We ate ice cream and
then played frisbee for a couple hours just outside OB.  That was
cool.  We all ran hard.  I entertained the girls with my impressions
and overall good looks.  Hmmm I need to speed this up.  We snuck the
Cougar brats (Fred, & Patty) to House of Pies. Forget all that.  The
real thing I want to tell you: Last night Molly, Jodi, Greg & Jeanine
picked up Fred and I and took us to HOPies.  After that I went to
watch Memphis Belle at Jodi's while Fred stayed here to sleep.  On the
way there, (Jeanine and I drove separately) Jeanine and I talked about
making out, etc.  We kissed just outside of Bates just before the
movie.  After the movie, Jen and I went up to her room and made out.
We kissed and then...</p>

<!-- I had her shirt off and sucked on her breasts and neck.  Then she had my shirt off then my pants off and she gave me head for a bit.  Then I took
her (short) shorts off and ate her out.  Then I climbed back on top of her and we fucked.  It was great.  I squirted on her chest and rested for a
second.  Then we hopped into the (hot) shower.  It was great.  The lights were off, so we could only feel eachother and the water pounding hard upon
us.  It was so hot.  We fucked some more in there, sitting down and standing from behind.  I soaped up my dick and her pussy.  She didn't complain
that it burned or stung as Tammy would have.  Oh it was so fantastic!  I loved the water pounding on us as I pounded her from behind and fingered her
clit from the front.  After the exertion and the hot water, I almost passed out when I sstopped.  So I sat down in the shower.  She tried to ride me,
but I was too tired... We got out and -->

<p>... found the bathroom floor to be soaked.  She didn't seem too
worried about it.  It was about 3am.  We slept until about 6am when I
got up and went home to sleep until 8:30 when I had to get up for work
today.  All day during work I thought about our adventure.  I'd love
to do it again.  Right now Laura is on her way over to talk about "a
couple of things."  We'll see what happens.  Later</p>
