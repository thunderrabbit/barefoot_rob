                        <p><p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)</p>

<p><p class=date>7:330 AM Wednesday March 25th, 1992.</p>

<p><p>I am now 22.  Monday we went to get the house keys copied for Jodi
and then went to look for some sandals for me.  We couldn&rsquo;t find any
that were wide enough.  The guy there said I ought to call a
podiatrist, who could tell me where in town someone could custom make
sandals for me.  Then we drove to Allen Parkway and walked about 1.5
miles.  That was nice.  I took some mental notes on the ball shaped
water fountain.  I estimated .1 gallons per second comes out of each
tube and there are 200 tubes =&gt; 20 gallons per second.  Pretty cool.
Then Jodi had to go to work.  While she worked, I called Castle of
Dreams.  I&rsquo;ve been pretty active on there lately.  I just found out
that Caleb/Black Magus is coming to UH in the Fall!  That will be
great.  Oh- either Sunday or Monday night Jodi took me to a carnival!
Fantastic.  We rode bumper cars together and the ferris wheel.  While
waiting for the ferris wheel, part of it fell.  Dude.  A small part -
one of the back rests of the chair.  Not a vital part, but it could
have killed(?) knocked someone out good if it had hit them.  While
waiting, Jodi and I finished off our carmel apple.  I asked the guy
where the trash was. He said &ldquo;right there.&rdquo;  I said &ldquo;Here on the
floor?&rdquo;  He said &ldquo;yeah you can throw it on the floor but not the
ground.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Ok&rdquo; So I tossed it onto the ferris wheel platform.  He was
like, &ldquo;Mannn&hellip;&rdquo; And walked up there and kicked it off.  One of the
side booths was throw-the-ball-and-break-a-bottle.  Cool.  They had
beer bottles inverted into holes in planks of wood.  Some mexican guys
were playing.  One dude was throwing the ball FAST. But he kept
missing.  That was a brilliant game.  People love to break glass, so
they&rsquo;ll pay to do it, and the carnival can get bottles for free off
the street.</p>

<p><p>Tuesday we went to the school.  Jodi went to the library. I went to
the VAX and got a tone of different files.  I still haven&rsquo;t unarchived
them yet. (I&rsquo;ve only gone through all the gifs. I have enough gifs
that I put them into different directories: girls, guys, cartoons,
cool stuff, etc. (I got the guys for Jodi)  I&rsquo;ll split the girls into
PG13, R, &amp; X rated.  We played Frisbee with Marcel and Molly for a
bit.  At the end, we were discussing how to make the Discs of Tron
game a reality.  In the movie, each player tosses a (energy) ball back
and forth (Maybe &ldquo;toss&rdquo; is the wrong word) And a player has to keep it
from hitting the ground, or that section of his ground will dissapear.</p>

<p><p>Now it&rsquo;s Wednesday, my birthday.  Jodi is sleeping here beside me
after our shower.  I fucked her from behind in the shower and squirted
in her.  Today we&rsquo;re going to go shopping for some plastic containers
for Aunt Jemima &amp; Bisquick and flour and stuff.  Later</p>
