                        <p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)</p>

<p class=date>8:PM Thursday January 2nd 1992</p>

<p><p>I am back at home now.  A lot happened at the beach house.  I was
most pleased with my outgoingness and the fact that I <b>learned</b>
every single name there.  Some cool things that I want to remember:</p>

<p><p><li>Mike had a HUGE jam box.  It truthfully reminded me of a space
craft.</p>

<p><p><li>Danny gave us $70 to purchase fireworks.  We went to the stand
and just kept on getting stuff.  &ldquo;How much is it now?&rdquo; we would ask.
&ldquo;$40&rdquo; &ldquo;Ok.  let&rsquo;s get some more&rdquo; At the end our total was $71.30.  The
girl said, &ldquo;The total is 71.30.&rdquo;  I said, &ldquo;Shoot - we&rsquo;ve only got 70
dollars.&rdquo;  She said, &ldquo;well, that&rsquo;s okay.. I&rsquo;ll cover the
dollar-thirty.&rdquo;  Cool.  There was also a dog named Chopper there.  So
in the &ldquo;Special thanks go to&rdquo; section of the Smelg album, we&rsquo;ll put
&ldquo;Special thanks to Chopper, and the chick who spotted us a
dollar-thirty on a seventy dollar purchase of explosives.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p><li>The ground between the beach and house was loaded with cockle
burrs.  The first couple of times that I went across, I wore shoes.
Then I walked barefoot across them.  The last several times, though, I
would yell &ldquo;Yaaaaagghhhh!!&rdquo; and <b>run</b> across them at top speed.
It was so hilarious when I&rsquo;d hear behind me, &ldquo;Wait, Rob, ther&rsquo;s
cockleburrs there!&rdquo; I would yell back, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Ok!!&rdquo; and continue
running.  Each time I did that, I&rsquo;d end up with about 10 of them in my
feet.</p>

<p><p><li>The last day, Mike, Bryan (Devin&rsquo;s brother) and I played
frisbee for a whle and then played tag with the two young cousins of
Devin &amp; Bryan, Adam &amp; Genie.  I drew a 20 by 20 foot boundary and we
played freeze tag for a while.  Then the grils got back from walking
and played as well.  That was so fun.  After that, we dug a sand
castle.  It was mostly Sarah and I who did it.  We dug a hole in the
center and built walls around it and then used the water for drippy
sand structures around the whole wall.  It was very nice.</p>

<p><p>We watched some Tiny Toons, I had never seen them before, but I can
see why Maggie has 8 or 16 hours worth of Tiny Toons recorded.  At the
end it was almost Rally quality goodbyes &amp; stuff.  We all had a
fantastic time and vowed to do it again.</p>

<p><p>We stopped at Adam&rsquo;s house and I got to meet his lovely sister,
Wendy.  She had her hair slicked back with conditioner.  It looked so
good.  We played on Adam&rsquo;s computers and he gave me a copy of
Lemmings.  I was invited to spend the night there, but I wanted to see
Tammy, so I had them bring me home.</p>
