<p class=date>Saturday, Januray 18, 1992, 6:35pm</p>

<p><p>I called Greer, and he requested that I come in from 6AM to 2PM
tomorrow.  Holy Shit that&rsquo;s early.  I&rsquo;ll live, though.  Last night
after work, I went out to the dorms, and we all took Marcel&rsquo;s Legos to
John&rsquo;s house.  Actually, before we left, I met some other people in
the dorm.  I met Christa(?) (I think that was her name) and I re-met
Elizabeth.  (She was the Elizabeth that played football with us last
semester after ultimate frisbee) Elizabeth had received a bullwhip for
Christmas, so we were all cracking that.  It was cool.  I threw a
tennis ball and dotted a guy&rsquo;s eye with it.  I met him (Terry) that
way.  He looks just like Ted in Bill and Ted&rsquo;s Excellent Adventure.
cool.  At John&rsquo;s, we ordered 6 pizzas.  There were plenty of cokes,
and fun things.  Maggie &amp; Molly brought presents for everyone.  I got
a sweatshirt (wearing it) that has &ldquo;THINK&rdquo; embroidered on the top left
chest area.  I brought Maggie a thing of yogurt covered raisins from
Kroger.  They are super.  They also brought popping candy.</p>

<p><p>We all (All = Jodi, Greg, Laura, me, Maggie, John, Marcel, Cindy,
Danielle, Charlie, Molly, &amp; Steve.  These names are paired according
to who was hugging on who, except for the last two (Molly &amp; Steve) who
hugged on no one.) watched <em>Terminator 2</em> and <em>Joe versus
The Volcano</em>.  We never did get out Marcel&rsquo;s Lego&rsquo;s, though.  We
left there at about 2AM. Molly sat in my lap on the way home.  On our
way through OB hall, Dana, Stacia, and some security guy were in
there, so I gave them each a packet of popping candy.  Dana &amp; Stacia
exchanged flavors; Stacia likes orange, and Dana likes strawberry.  We
went to Larua &amp; Molly&rsquo;s room and I lay down for a bit on their bean
bag.  Laura walked me out, and we kissed for a few minutes at the exit
door.  Nice.  Oh- while we watched the movie, she rubbed my feet for a
few minutes.  I Loved it.  Tammy never does that.  Later</p>
