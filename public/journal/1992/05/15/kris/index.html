<p><p class=date>3AM Friday</p>

<p><p>God! I didn&rsquo;t realize it was this late.  Today I went out to the
dorms and played frisbee with Marcel &amp; helped people move out and
watched the Simpsons.  Before that, Molly, Kris and I went to Pizza
Hut for pizza. I massaged Kris&rsquo; foot while we were eating.  They were
both sitting across from me and I got Kris to put her foot beside me
&amp; I took her shoe off and rubbed her foot.  At one point, after the
Simpson&rsquo;s, Kris and I were suddenly alone in the hallway and we
started to french kiss for about a minute.  Cool.  We all went to
House of Pies and ate.  Kris paid more attention to Greg than to me,
but I didn&rsquo;t let it bug me at all.  We got back to the dorms and then
I left.  Kris walked me out and we made out for about 3 minutes
including crotch rubbing (through shorts) (her crotch on my leg) (and
a little pelvis grinding) and me pinching her nipples.  At the end,
she said she wished it could continue, but she needed to get back.  So
she walked back and I drove home and jacked off and then wrote this.</p>

<p><p>Oh- also today, Tammy moved her shit out and Jodi &amp; Maggie &amp; Molly
(&amp; Jeanine via Molly) Moved stuff into here.  Jodie&rsquo;s stereo &amp; Greg&rsquo;s
refrigerator, which is by my bed now.  Maggie is going to move in
tomorrow for 1 week.  Ultimately cool.  I also bought 2 CD&rsquo;s.  Wayne&rsquo;s
World Soundtrack and Siouxsie &amp; the Banshees Peepshow.  I have to work
&ldquo;tomorrow&rdquo; until 8:30PM, but I&rsquo;ll be back out to say &ldquo;HI.&rdquo; after that.
I will be at Kroger work on Saturday until 4PM, and most of them will
be gone after that.  Sigh&hellip;. I&rsquo;m going to miss everyone.  Later - Rob</p>
