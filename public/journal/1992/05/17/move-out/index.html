<p><p class=date>12:18 AM, Monday, May 17, 1992</p>

<p><p>Maggie is here with me to help with this entry.  On Friday, we
moved the rest of Maggie&rsquo;s stuff just before work, during which time
Marcel and I did our Hans and Frans imitation.  They are 2 body
building characters on Saturday Night Live.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Hans&rdquo; &ldquo;Und I&rsquo;m
Frans.&rdquo;  unison: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re here to move..&rdquo; <CLAP> &ldquo;You out!&rdquo;  &ldquo;Hey Hans,
do you need some help with that single sheet of paper?  I know it must
be very heavy for you.&rdquo;  &ldquo;No. I could carry all of these boxes with
one pinky.&rdquo; etc etc.  Fun stuff.  Then I went to work.  Then I came
back to the dorms at about 9PM.  Molly &amp; Kris were nowhere.  Maggie &amp;
Eric &amp; Marcel had gone to see Split Second.  So I simply helped
different people move.  I helped Casey and a girl named Salena (sp)
move some stuff.  Salena is tall and smart &amp; funny and wears no
shoes.  Cool.  At one point I was eating some Thin Mints in exchange
for moving boxes and I was dancing around.  Salena looked at me
(accurately) as if I was crazy.  I told her that cookies make me
dance.  She gave me a raised-eyebrow intrigued look and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
remember that.&rdquo;  We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

<p><p>After a while, I met up with Molly and Kris and Greg.  Kris did not
flirt with me as much as she did the previous night, but I didn&rsquo;t
mind.  I knew that I shouldn&rsquo;t expect anything from her necessarily.
After another while, we (Molly, Kris, Greg &amp; I) were headed for House
of Pies.  While driving out of the parking lot, we caught up with
Maggie Eric &amp; Marcel.  So <em>All</em> of us went for the official
last House of Pies trip of the semester.  It was fun, but kind of
sad.  I&rsquo;m going to miss that this summer.  After House of Pies, Maggie
&amp; I got her shelves from her room and then drove her to my house.  We
talked about nothing and tentatively planned our week.</p>

<p><p>The next morning (Saturday) I went to Kroger from 8AM to 4PM. I
might get to do some stuff on the computer there.  Cool.</p>

<p><p>After work, Maggie &amp; I went with Heather and Pierre shopping for
groceries.  Maggie paid for it in exchange for getting to spend the
week here.  Heh heh. I get the best of both worlds!  Free food and
Maggie for a week!  We also went to Sound warehouse where I bought a
CD of Blondie for the song &ldquo;French Kissing in the U.S.A.&rdquo; and Duran
Duran <em>RIO</em>. Cool.  We also rented and watched DarkMan at
Heather&rsquo;s.  After the movie, (John came over right at the end of the
movie) I rubbed Heather&rsquo;s feet and back for a while, while Pierre
played computer and John &amp; Maggie giggled &amp; licked eachother.
Actually, Maggie would lick John&rsquo;s cheek just to see his reaction.
Then Maggie, John &amp; I went to my house and then John went home.  I was
darn tired and slept soundly until work.  I got off work at 6:PM
(Kroger) and then came home to Maggie &amp; tuna casseole.  My dad came
over and swapped the van, whose brakes need to be fixed, for Fred&rsquo;s
Volkswagon bug, whose everything needs to be fixed.  Then Maggie &amp; I
played the Truth portion of Truth or Dare.  She asked what was the
kinkiest thing I had ever done.  I told her about Tammy sticking the
frozen table knife handle up my ass while I jacked off laying on my
back on her kitchen table at her Stillwater house.  We talked until
John came over and he ate and then left at bout Midnight.</p>

<p><p>Yesterday Maggie asked me, &ldquo;so, Rob, does it turn you on to see
Mickey crawling on me?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I laughed.  She laughed.  After a while I told her that it doesn&rsquo;t
turn me on any more than just her standing there.  so she said, &ldquo;How
does this turn you on?&rdquo; and basically grabbed me and started to french
me.  I was more than willing to return the kiss, so I moved us to my
bed, where we rolled around and kissed for a good half hour.
<em><b>NOT!</b></em> Heh heh.  just kidding.  We didn&rsquo;t kiss.  Really.</p>

<p><p>Tomorrow we plan to do laundry and then buy a rat for Mickey, and
John will come watch him eat it with us.  Later</p>
