                        <p><p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)</p>

<p><p class=date>5AM Wednesday, May 13, 1992</p>

<p><p>Dude &ldquo;today&rdquo; was the last day of finals for me.  At 8AM, Heather &amp;
I studied over here for a while before class at 11AM.  11AM was my
Assembly Language final.  I did Ok on it most likely.  After that was
my Physics III final.  I also did well on it.  I didn&rsquo;t study one inch
for either of them.</p>

<p><p>Today, Molly &amp; Maggie&rsquo;s friend, Kris, came to visit from Illinois
until Saturday.  Cool.  She and I flirted a lot.  Everyone went to
Star Pizza today after finals.  Everyone = Me, Maggie, John, Jeanine,
Greg, Molly, Kris, Heather, &amp; Pierre.  That was cool.  Then we went to
the dorms and played card games.  Pouce, Cancellation Hearts &amp; Nuclear
War.  Then we all went to House of Pies.  We all = Me, Laura, Jeaning,
Kris, Molly, MArcel, Steve, Judy, &amp; Greg.  Then we came back to the
dorms.  On the way to House of Pies, I was in the back seat with Kris
and I nibbled her ear a bit and nibbled the back of her neck.  When we
got back, she blew/nibbled my ear and gave me an &lsquo;eargasm&rsquo;.  Cool.
Right in front of Laura &amp; Molly, &amp; Jeanine, too.  Then at the very
end, Kris was on Molly&rsquo;s bed and I was on the bean bag with Molly.
Kris said, &ldquo;come let me blow your ear again.&rdquo;  So I agreeably jumped
up and lay down to let Kris do my ears.  After a while, we were just
laying there, and she said, &ldquo;well, if you&rsquo;re going to fall asleep,
come get under the covers.&rdquo;  So I did.  We cuddled for a few minutes
until Laura told me that she&rsquo;d prefer if I left.  I figured Laura was
probably right, so I did.  I gave Kris a hug and told her simply,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you later.&rdquo;  Molly walked out with me, and she &amp; I went to
Jeanine&rsquo;s for a while.  We talked about nothing and I gave Jeanine a
back massage.  At about 4:30AM I told them I had to go to bed, so I
gave Jeanine big major hugs, since she&rsquo;ll be goen (today) tomorrow
while I&rsquo;m at work.</p>

<p><p>Also today, I bought my SEX Madonna shirt from Kim for $6.00.  I
love it.  On the front it has Madonna wearing next to nothing and it
says &ldquo;S E X&rdquo; on it.  On the back, it has her again and it says &ldquo;sex
and Malice&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m going out with Lucy tomorrow (today) after work and
I&rsquo;ll be back at the dorms on Thursday. Later (5-13-92 5:25AM)</p>
