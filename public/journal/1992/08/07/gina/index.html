<p><p class=date>12:15 AM Friday August 7, 1992</p>

<p><p>Wednesday at House of Pies, Marcel, Will &amp; I played frisbee in the
parking lot.  Then James showed up and we 4 played and then we went in
to eat.  Jodi showed up after a while and joined us, and then Laura M
and her friend Gina (sp) came.  Gina had braces, and she sat next to
me.  RIGHT!!!  We flirted a little during our meal.  At 11:30PM I had
to leave to pick up Laura W at Hobby airport.  As I was leaving, Gina
asked if I wanted her to escort me out.  I said &lsquo;sure.&rsquo;  However, Will
was blocking her from getting out, and she didn&rsquo;t want to make a big
scene, and I didn&rsquo;t want to make a big obvious flirtation scene so she
ended up not escorting me out.  If she had I was in such a mood that I
would have stated bluntly, &ldquo;I have a braces fetish.  May I kiss you?&rdquo;
I would have done it.  I swear.  Oh well.  I left and got Laura and I
spent Wednesday night at her house.  I spent all Thursday there, too.
It was fun, and I called Castle of Dreams (we&rsquo;re currently building a
giant wooden roller coaster on the cloud) and read a Foxtrot cartoon
book.  I just got home at 11:30PM and returned Marcel&rsquo;s call.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Tomorrow&rdquo; we might play nuclear war at Laura&rsquo;s depending on if I
can call her and how late she wants to do it.  I&rsquo;d love to go, since
Gina might be there.  But it can&rsquo;t be too late, &lsquo;cause Saturday is
Astroworld!  RIGHT!!!  If I see a girl at Astroworld with
braces&hellip;. watch out.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m going to meet Marcel and Alise and April there at 9:45 AM.
We&rsquo;ll play until we drop or until I have to leave for the Castle of
Dreams Bad Movie Fest.  Total Cool.  I hope I&rsquo;m not too totally heart
broken by leaving Astroworld that early.  I haven&rsquo;t been there in 2
seasons&hellip; I wonder if I&rsquo;ll kiss either April or Alise?  or both?
Will they have braces?  Will they be too young?  We&rsquo;ll find out.
Later</p>
