                        <p><p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)</p>

<p><p class=date>1:35AM, Saturday, August 22, 1992</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Today&rdquo; I got to Good Morning America a tad early (2 minutes) and
took a picture of Alex beside Wayne &amp; Garth in Wayne&rsquo;s World.  he
watched the movie every night this week.  When I came in, there was a
big big group of peple in the hotel lobby who had been awake all
night.  At 4AM, a lady came up to me and said, &ldquo;So, is tomorrow your
last day?&rdquo;  I thought for a second and then said, &ldquo;No. <em>Today</em>
is our last day.&rdquo;</p>

<pre>
That could be interesting
</pre>

<p><p>She looked at her watch, and a little of realization hit her.</p>

<p><p class=date>7:55AM same day.</p>

<p><p>First, a note about the previous entry.  I was totally falling
asleep as I wrote the last 3 lines.  The text in blue was totally out
of a dream I was having.  I just wrote it down, knowing that it might
not make sense, but it would be a hardcopy of an otherwise elusive
dream thought.  The last line kinda makes sense; the worde are right,
but it&rsquo;s missing something.</p>

<p><p>Now, here&rsquo;s omething that&rsquo;s more like what I would have written if
I had been awake, starting with that which is in blue.</p>

<p><p>She looked at her watch, and looked a bit surprise as she realized
what I meant.  I said, &ldquo;go get some sleep.&rdquo;  she said, &ldquo;OK..&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>While we were at the &ldquo;Home Base,&rdquo; and I was keeping pedestrian
traffic moving (&ldquo;Just don&rsquo;t stop in the area, sir. Walk all the way
through.&ldquo;) a very nice looking girl approached me and asked about the
show and stuff.  I talked with her and then she left, and sat on a
chair to watch.  A bit later, we got a 15 minute break, and I sat and
talked to her.  Her name is Kelly and she&rsquo;s a computer programmer!
RIGHT!!! She lives in Phoenix, but I swapped addresses with her on her
business cards.  I said &ldquo;Hey&rdquo; to her several times after that as I was
running around during the show.</p>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s now 8:12AM.  I&rsquo;m going to Tomball to help ma pack.</p>

<p><p class=date>3:30PM Saturday August 22, 1992</p>

<p><p>Yesterday I got to sit in the seat that Dan Quayle was going to use
for the interview.  I acted as the lighting/camera guinea pig as the
lighting &amp; camera crews set up stuff around me.  Doug sat in Charlie&rsquo;s
chair, &ldquo;So, Mr Quayle, what do you think your chances for reelection
are?&rdquo;  &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be OK if I can just remember to spell &ldquo;vote&rdquo;
without an &ldquo;e&rdquo; on the end.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Doug covered his eyes and lowered his head as he laughed&hellip; It was
quite funny.  The Secret Service dudes swarmed over the whole hotel.
I would sya, &ldquo;Good Morning!&rdquo; to each of them, and they would just
grunt.  Except for one, who commented on the Good Morning America
T-shirt I was wearing.  I said, &ldquo;OK Ok.. I&rsquo;ll give you the shirt for
that little pin on your jacket.&rdquo;  He expelled a nervous choke of
laughter. &ldquo;Oh jeez. I might as well give you my first born.&rdquo;  Dude.</p>

<p><p>At the ending scene, Charlie was right by our &ldquo;office&rdquo;.  He said,
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be right back.&rdquo; and Patty the stage manager said, in her New
Jersey accent, &ldquo;Okay! Ten minute break!&rdquo; Charlie went in the room and
tossed the nerf football a little.  I was on the other side of the
table (Diagnoally opposite) and I said, &ldquo;hey, you wanna play?&rdquo; So he
tossed it to me and we played catch for 2 or 3 minutes RIGHT!!! I have
never enjoyed throwing a football per se, but since it was Charlie, I
loved it.  It was totally cool.  And he was commenting on throws. &ldquo;Oh
that was a good one&rdquo; &ldquo; This football is hard to spiral&rdquo; etc.  I loved
it.</p>

<p><p>Then Patty announced &ldquo;Okay we&rsquo;re back in 2 mintues!&rdquo;  So he went
out there and I <em>ran</em> to the other side of the htoel so I would
be in the background.  I stood there for the duration of the show.
Cool.</p>

<p><p>Afterward, Fred (runner) and I went to the 30th floor and took
pictures.  We snuck into a room that had a door ajar and took a
picture from the window.  The room was bigger than my whole apartment.</p>
