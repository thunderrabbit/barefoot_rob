                        <p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)

<p class=date>2:40AM Friday 28 Aug 1992.</p>

<p>Today is my last day of work.  Excellent!  "Today" I cleaned up
around the house and then went to the dorms to watch the Simpsons.
After that I went to the North East wing of Taub and chilled with
everyone there.  I left after a while with Heather, and we read comics
up in her room and then we did the crossword puzzle.  At about 1AM she
said she was going to bed and that I was welcome to stay in a non
sexual way.  Cool.  I didn't have my contact stuff, though so I had to
cruise.  That was unfortunate.  She is so so totally pretty.  I would
have enjoyed sleeping beside her.  I spent about 1 hour getting my bag
from Marcel's room, since he & Molly were at House of Pies when I
tried to get back in Taub.  Oh well.  I got it and I'm home.</p>

<p>On the way home as I drove along I-45 feeder, I saw probably 10 or
15 police cars FUCKING HAULING ASS on I45.  I was stopped at a light
and I heard a siren coming like crazy.  A cop car going way too fast
to make the turn slammed his brakes and skidded skidded and turned to
get on I45.  Shit.  I was afraid he was about to go smashing into one
of the pilings... Several wreckers were flying down the highway, too.
So I expect it was one gnarly wreck.  Later</p>
