<p><p class=date>13:25 Thurs 20 Aug 92</p>

<p><p>Yesterday before the show, John and I got some elephant mylar
balloons out of the UPS room and decorated the set with them.  In the
process, 3 of them got loose and required 2 or 3 full minutes to float
to the ceiling.  Amazing.  After the show, Charlie was in a pretty
good mood.  I talked to him a bit - joking about how he was going to
do the bunjee jump from the 30th floor.  Pretty funny.  I talked to
TRQ (The Right Question), a pro Bush rapper, whose real name is Steve
something.  Doug and I taked to him after the show about getting him a
T-shirt.  At 11AM yesterday, I walked to the Lancaster Hotel and
picked up some guy&rsquo;s Ford Taurus because they needed it at the
Astrodome to get in.  (The car had a sticker on it that would let them
in.) I got to the Lancaster, and the valet dude opened the car door
for me (It was double parked in front of the hotel) He wished me a
safe trip and I drove to the Sheritan hotel near the Astrodome.  They
took the car and drove to the Astrodome, and left me in a new white
Lincoln Towncar.  Here&rsquo;s a quote from my day planner:</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in the reserve parking spot since Lynn gave Jose&rsquo; the valet
five bucks.  11:37AM I&rsquo;m listening to &ldquo;summertime&rdquo; by DJ Jazzy Jeff
and the Fresh Prince.  This stereo is nice.  Nice speakers with great
bass.</p>

<p><p>Shit the sideview mirror says &ldquo;Heated&rdquo; on it.  Now I&rsquo;m listening to
&ldquo;Sweet Dreams (are made of these)&rdquo;  The stero has a button on it that
says, &ldquo;audio&rdquo; It cycles the display through the following:
frequency/volume, Bass, Treble, Balance, Fade.  And the Volume button
(-  +) switches them accordingly.  Cool.</p>

<p><p>The airconditioner is on, and the engine is on.  They&rsquo;re so quiet
that I can&rsquo;t hear either.  I&rsquo;m going to sleep.  12:20PM Woke up.  Now
they have me driving the Taurus again.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>OK.  Back to real time now.  So they went to the Astrodome, while I
simply slept for 30 minutes. RIGHT!!!</p>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s now 16:58:15 Thursday 20 August 1992.  Molly just called from
Missouri.  They&rsquo;re on their way home!  Yay!!</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>Alex was watching Wayne&rsquo;s World again today. 20 Aug 92</p>

<p><p>Today at GMA, everyone was tired.  I took pictures of the whole
place and all the people.  I grabbed some of the pictures that John
took yesterday, including one of me zonked out hard.  I totally
totally need a foot and back massage.  I wish Laura were here.  Maybe
Molly will do it.  I slept for a couple hours todya, and then I did my
budget and wrote a birthday card for Cheri.  Now I&rsquo;m going to get a 2
inch binder from Bizmart to hold my computer manuals.</p>
