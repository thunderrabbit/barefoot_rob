<p>(not proofread)</p>

<p class=date>Sunday 11 February 1990</p>

<p>I just got back today from the 1990 Dallas Rally.  On Friday I
picked up Fred (my brother) from his house & we met Rick E and Mike O
at 6pm.  We left in Rick's truck shortly afterward.  We got there at
about 10:something & not many people were there.  I got a mesage to
call my mom (She's going to school at SMU, which is very close to the
church).  I called her and she invited me to come see her apartment.
It was neat.  Very small, but neat.  She has a little kitchen sink &
table & couch & her computer where the T.V. would be.  I met her
friend Lilliann ("Lilly Anne - all one word")  She's really nice.  I
played a little bit of Vegas Gambler while they sat on the couch and
watched... That was fun, but the Rally was calling.  So mom took me
back while Lilliann slept on Ma's couch.</p>

<p>
I got back and saw Joy B and Aaron M again (They got there just before I went to Ma's).  Delayna D was there & Mikael the girl was there.  Opening circle was at 2AM.  We all stood up and said something about ourselves.  Jody K was the first to go.  She was sitting beside me.  Just like my very first Rally, I stood up right after she was done.  I said, "I'm not going last."  Then Dallas D, Alva's sister realized she would be last...
<p>
After the circle, I walked around and talked to different people.  Troy S showed me some pictures.. Including the "Brawn Hand Blender" which he gave me today while we at donuts at the end of the Rally.
<p>
Fred sat by Jasmine -- He held her hand the entire weekend.  Joy sat on my shoulders for a while like last year.  I took Mikael's neat bracelet & wore it for a while.  Delayna and I sat and talked about old times.. Including about Dustin & all those from ConCon 1988.  Delayna & I slept beside each other at about 3:30AM.  We slept till about 7AM.
<p>
We all had pancakes for breakfast.  While standing in line for the pancakes I met Chris - a little guy who I believe is blind or mostly blind.  I helped him get his pancakes & sausage -- & I got him some OJ.  After breakfast I sat with him for a while --I didn't know if he would be ok alone or what.  I finally decided he would be.  I asked if he would-He was..
<p>
For the first workshop I went to Youth Power.  The guy told us how we could do things that would benefit society.  Things that didn't take lots of brains, but very helpful... Like build parks or clean up trash or volunteer in a hospital or whatever.  It was a neat workshop. 
<p>
We had sandwiches for lunch that day - bologna & cheese & ham & mayo.  No lettuce or tomato though... oh well.  Oh - I put chips on mine.  I had 3 sandwiches.  I needed the energy for Ultimate frisbee which we played just after lunch.
<p>
Oh- just before lunch I went to the YMCA with Aaron M to take showers.  I didn't bring my towel so I used his.  I watched some guys play racquetball for a while afterward.  They were good...
<p>
After lunch we went to the YMCA field to play frisbee.  There were some guys already there playing football.  Since we both wanted the whole field, one of the football guys & me & Aaron & someone else who I don't remember his name (he did the meditation workshop..) went into the office to see who would have to go.  The girl there didn't know & she called "Ed" who apparently ran the Y.  He said the church had the field.  Yay!  Me and Aaron thought we were just the baddest dudes in the world after that.  As we walked out he casually put his hand behind him & we gave eachother five.
<p>
Ultimate frisbee was great.  It had rained, so the field was just the right amount of soft.  I made a couple of spectacular catches- one where I jumped way up over a guy & snagged it before he caught it.  It was a totally great game.  I ran & ran & ran.
<p>
After that was the second set of workshops.  I went to the meditation.  I really really relaxed during that.  It was great.  I fell asleep for only a little bit of it.
<p>
After that I went out to the swings with Aaron & Delayna & Joy & Jennifer B (I think that's her name) That was neat.  I got up on the swing set & walked across the bar.  I didn't even fall.. I climbed 3 of the trees out there.  They were pretty good climbing trees.  One had very pokin' bark & it hurt my feet though.
<p>
At one point we went out to the wall & waved at all the cars.  The highlights were the Porsches & BMWs & Mercedes.. The highlight of the highlights was "<em>Lamborghini!!</em>"<br>
We all jumped off the wall - yelling & waving as we ran toward the sidewalk.  The guy saw us & revved up his engine.  The sound was beautiful.  So powerful & cool.  Vroo- Vroo- VROOOOOOOOM!!!  It was completely kick ass awesome.  It was a beautiful red Lamborghini - forgive me for not knowing what model...
<p>
Oh- we quit waving to cars after one driver <b>bumped</b> a van because he was watching us & not the road... 
<p>After workshops & cars & stuff I was part of a circle in the hallway - we did some ohms & then I suggested that we play the squeeze game - I got in the middle & tried to locate a hand squeeze that went around the circle.  I never could find it... So we played the telephone game.  I started the first one: "Three men & a monkey went hunting in the forest with a rainbow."<br>
When it got around, it was something about some people in a parking lot.
<p>
The next one was started - something about pink converse tennis shoes.  Maybe it was, "I bought some ham in my pink converse."  It got around to me: "I will not eat green eggs & sperm I am Sam, Sam I am."  Wow.
<p>
After that Mike A's band was playing.  We went to see them.  It was pretty cool.  They played a big variety of stuff.  Including, "I'm an airplane" & one with a neat neat drum beat.
<p>
After the concert we had the talent show.  It was great.  I did the Fairy Tale with Mike A and I drew a picture of Mike O.  I also sold some Coke (Coca Cola) to Fred.  It was funny.  Carrie did a great mime, "locked in a box".  After the concert I sat with Jennifer and Aaron and Joy and Mikael and we talked and took turns listening to a super cool CD of Aaron's.  It was a German group - I forget their name.  The song was a series of synthesized drum beats in stereo-  cool cool stuff.
<p>
That night I slept alone from 4 to 7AM.  I got up after dying for a few minutes from being so so so so sore. I cleaned up my stuff & then went to closing circle.
<p>
We sang Dear Friends & Yogi Bear & Plastic Jesus & Halls of LRY.  We then did a couple of Colorado hugs on my suggestion, & then we did a spiral - Shane's suggestion.  With 90 people - that got complicated.  But we did it and it was fun.
<p>
We then had donuts outside & exchanged last hugs and goodbyes. I really didn't want to go.  Troy gave me the Brawn Hand Blender picture -  I gave him my address.. I wonder what will happen... Joy told me not to write her - she would write me.  I promised a letter to Jennifer and Delayna.  I hugged everyone again and again.  
<p>
I saw Aaron.  We hugged & I was saying, "shit man..."  No words... I didn't want to go.  I'm going to miss everyone... We left, though.  Rick drove the entire way.  
<p>
We only stopped once - for gas.  Fred and Mike slept all the way; I slept about 1/2 the way.  We got to the church and I put on a name tag: "Hello I'm <b>TIRED</b>."  It was great.</p>
