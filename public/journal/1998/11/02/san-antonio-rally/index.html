                        <p><title>San Antonio Rally</title></p>

<p class=date>2 November 1998</p>

<p>Here is my version of this past weekend lock-in at San Antonio with 120+ youth and a ton of fun!

<p>Here are <a href="/images/YRUU/san_antonio_1998">pics from the rally</a>.

<p><hr>

<p>How incredible to think that just counting from memory, we brought more than 25 youth from Houston!  Yay! This whole Houston Network thing is working wonderfully!

<p>Youth from Emerson church collected at Emerson and waited for youth from First Church to arrive.  They had a 15 passenger van, and we had a 7 passenger..  4 advisors and 17 youth and we were on our way!

<p>We stopped more than I wanted, but got there plenty early considering how short the drive is.

<p>Bing!! We were at the rally! and I stayed up the first night until 8am!  I usually crash by like 5 or 6am for a couple of hours.  During the night I remembered or re-learned names of many youth..  It took forever to remember Joanna's but I finally did and let her know I remember by signing it out to her during opening circle. (Thanks Kathryn for teaching me the alphabet!)  I remembered Nuha Kadri's all the way back from I think Dallas Rally last year.. and I was sure to remember because she said there is no way I could do it. Ha!

<p>Um, oh one weird thing was the movie <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> it was bizarre stop action animation type stuff that reminded me of a Frank Black movie I saw some time ago. I sat and watched the end of that until like 7 am or so when it was just thinking about getting light outside.

<p>I slept from about 8:30am to 10 or so and wondered what was up when a herd of youth rumbled quietly out to the basketball court.
I took pictures as they were climbing up on the dome jungle gym over Eric Morrow.  Funny stuff!  <a href="/images/YRUU/san_antonio_1998/ondome.jpg">Here's a pic</a>.

<p><a href="/images/YRUU/san_antonio_1998/underdome.jpg">Here</a> is Eric.

<p>Soon thereafter, for some reason I cannot explain, Sean (who was sleeping peacefully in the first pic above) and Jason were <a href="/images/YRUU/san_antonio_1998/jasonsean.jpg">wrestling in the grass.</a>

<p>Soon after that, Kris was up in the big tree after being chased by Sean..  I climbed up and got some pics.  <a href="/images/YRUU/san_antonio_1998/intree.jpg">Here's one.</a>

<p>For the next 5 or 6 hours, I was in a YAC meeting. We got a lot done and settled; we're working on getting the YAC PAC complete and making a standard way for rallies to be YAC Approved. Good stuff.

<p>After the YAC meetin' we had dinner of lasagna and I had a big enormous piece of cake. Big. Huge. Lots of icing.  :-)

<p>And then we had YAC elections, fully facilitated by the youth on YAC.  Out of 6 youth who ran, Elizabeth Severance, Adam Lock, and Melissa Cain were elected.

<p>That evening Jason Fricke and I did our <a href="/images/YRUU/san_antonio_1998/back_to_back.jpg">gymnastical stunts</a>
and foolin' around and it developed into a game of keep-away with the big tape ball that resulted in wadding up the tape that had been used to make the life size chess board..  I was in the YAC meeting during all that.  (Someone said it was more like a pillow fight pretending to be a chess game)

<p>I <a href="/images/YRUU/san_antonio_1998/rob_sleepin.jpg">took a nap</a> before the talent show.

<p>Kris Scott and Aaron Ivener performed some songs, and I totally love how they play together..  They have a connection that is wonderful as they work back and forth on stage.  Nevermind.. I can't describe it.

<p>Nick Carter and I each ate a box of Nerds.  One of the boxes that has two flavors. I think it was Grape and Watermelon.
That was quite an ordeal, but we did it!  I stayed onstage the entire time until my entire box was nothing but fiber and I swallowed the whole thing (one little bit at a time)

<p>I'm sure that was more than you wanted to hear..  

<p>Nick played a beautiful, dramatic, (improvised?) piece on the piano while he chewed his box of Nerds.</p>

<p>Also I got my face painted (mostly just a bunch of base, given the <a href="/images/YRUU/san_antonio_1998/makeup.jpg">picture</a>).  That was pretty wacky.  

<p>Oh, and just before that, Kris and I did voices for Jen and Dane for the San Antonio Saki part IV School-A-Saki, which we first did last year. I thought we did quite well; our best one yet!

<p>After the talent show we pulled together a game of Silent Football.  Yay!!

<p>I was nominated Dictator, and Jeremy, Austin, Katie, Adam, Bryn, Bryan, Chris.. man I can't remember all who played.
<br>I was very quick to call "Holy Gihad!" whenever someone even thought about messing with the group.  I called it a bit quickly on Ryan Ray, and I'm sorry about that.
<br>I'm sure there is a happy medium somewhere.

<p>So the game went on for a pretty long time and got wacked out for a while, but after Jeremy excused himself, we had a more serious (as if Silent Football can be serious) game.

<p>What was funny was I started the game with a Surge, and had my pockets stuffed with 4 other Surges. So each time I'd finish one, I open up another.  I had 6 empty in front of me by the end of the game and I HAD TO PEEEEEE!!

<p>Ahem.  So it was a pretty great game, and I pretty much went to bed right after.  My diary says I lay down at 5:40am.

<p>But I didn't sleep.  Finally I found something that kept me awake!  Six cans of Surge!  (and that was after the huge piece of cake and groovy juice (which I didn't even mention)).

<p>I lay in bed for 1 hour, including through most of cleanup, and soon ended up with Jason Fricke trying to get me up. "If I have to be up, you have to be up."   Pfshh.  yeah right.

<p>But I got up and we made some copies of the Houston Rally registration and handed them out at closing circle.

<p>This review is dragging.  We hugged, loaded up in the chilly rain and went to Taco Cabana and went home.</p>
