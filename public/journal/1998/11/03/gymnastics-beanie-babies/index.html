                        <p><title>Bouncing Beanie Babies</title></p>

<p class=date>Tuesday 3 November 1998</p>

<p>Last week I didn't go to gymnastics because I hurt my ankle jumping over Maggie's couch.  I did go this week, but my ankle wasn't happy enough to do round off back handsprings on the floor.

<p>Today my heart just wasn't into tumbling.  I did several russians (russian style front flips) and 1 back hand spring.

<p>However, on the trampoline, I did a lot of fun stuff!

<p>Mostly I bounced and bounced like Thunder Rabbit does in the Sauna and I did a couple of back flips.  Then I did a ton of front flips, all in a row.

<p>Now, they weren't front flips landing on my feet each time, but front flips landing on my shoulders/back each time.  The first time I did them tonight, I was able to do 9 in a row.  I was a tad dizzy after that.

<p>The next time I did 12 in a row! 

<p>I did a couple of front handspring vaults, and a straddle vault and two (almost) stoop throughs (That's where my legs stay straight and go between my arms.)  The first one was good, but the second one I had bent knees.

<p>And then I had a delightful brainstorm.. Why not collect all the beanie babies that were strewn around the gym and bounce with them all on the trampoline?  I couldn't think of a good reason not to, so I collected 4 of them.

<p>{Boingy} {boingy} {boingy} {boingy} I went and they didn't bounce as high as I, but they boinged and binged and bounced around as I jumped.  

<p>I made up a game of seeing how few bounces I could take and bounce each of them high enough to catch all four.  (not necessarily at the same time)    After a little bit of practice, I was able to do it in 6 bounces.

<p>About 15 minutes of bouncing beanie babies was all I could handle, so I did a couple more vaults or something.. 

<p>It was about time to go home, so I did some final cool down leg stretches with Carrie (sp) who happens to live across the street from me, and went home.
