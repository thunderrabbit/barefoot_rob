<p class=date>15 November 1998</p>
<br><font size="-1">(transcribed from my diary)</font>

<p><em>En route</em> to Tulsa. I'm driving Denise's van, and Denise & kT are asleep.  Adam is silently reading in the back. I'm in a reflective mood... healthy contemplation of my life after reading so much of <em>Science of the Gods</em>. OKC is 48 miles away.

<p>The book describes a physics that I don't really care about but I've been enjoying the paranormal and unusual events and stuff it has described.

<p>Most intriguing to me now is the life of the plant kingdom, with faeries, and elves, and the god Pan described and the devas that are the architects of each different type of plant and stuff. I can meditate and receive the gift of how to care for the lush green plant in my sunroom.

<p>I am pretty darn super excited about FlashNet! I wrote 8 emails this morning and called Carrie and Wende.  That's 10 contacts. I've got 70+ names of my friends on my list that I started last night.  And it's so wacky that I just say, "if you know someone who needs access, let me know!"

<p><hr width="20%">

<p>4:29pm Friday 13 November 1998 (10460) [note: that's how many days old I am this day]

<p>I'm driving on "something Turner Turnpike" maybe, and it's 90 miles to Tulsa and 30 miles to "free restrooms" and 45 miles to toll plaza. At least this was true 3 miles ago when I started writing. I have to pee.  That was true when I started driving over 1 hour ago.

<p>I hope the youth embrace the license plate frames that I made and am bringing. I woulda liked them better if the big bar was on the bottom.

<p>When I get back from Tulsa I'm going to make more flashnet contacts and order business cards and stuff. When I get back from Costa Rica, it's no holds barred crazy flashnet mania at my house.

<p><hr width="20%">

<p>Iraq war may happen again over weapons inspection. NPR was all talkin' about it.

<p><hr width="20%">

<p>Midnight Friday night 13 Nov 1998 (10461 on Saturday)

<p>Found my mom and Jon and hugged and called Delayna and Janette called back and I thought it was Delayna and stuff and was surprised that she needed directions to the church but gave them to her but she never showed up (Janette (nor Delayna)).

<p>Took Denise to hotel and called Delayna and figured out my error. Back to Hope Church and talked to Eric Posa and Gayle Keen.

<p><hr width="20%">

<p>7:15am Saturday 14 November 1998

<p>Last night we played Silent Football until 3am.

<p>I was dictator, with Jeremy L-N, Bryn C, Noah W, Leslie A, Ellen S, Nathan R, Adam W. Adam kept yakking and had a clear win at first but he got to 4.5 and I was just about to begin play and he kept his hand up. I was all, "Mr Adam has <em>four point five</em> points... Mr Adam." and within 10 seconds he lost.

<p>Ellen was super impressive at her knowledge of pronouns. And her memory in general was most impressive.

<p>Katy A had started playing but bowed out due to tiredness.

<p>Bryn wrote a most beautiful most flattering Ode to Rob in the Big Gray Rally Book. I was so touched.  I may scan it and put it in here.

<p>Adam has to do a report on either UU Software workshop, or all 3 workshops that he attends.

<p>We got about less than 3 hours of sleep. As the lights were off and we were layin' there, the youth kept yakking and I was all "okay everyone count silently to 100 and when you get to 100 start over."  Silence.
<br>Then Jeremy was all, "starting over"
<br>Laughter
<br>Silence
<br>Golden sleep

<p>Oh, the funniest thing: "in an unprecedented move, Mr Dictator awares Mr Jeremy 1/2 of one penance point for ..., awards Ms Bryn 1/2 of one penance point ..." and I went around the entire circle giving each player 1/2 penance point for the specific "crime" that person had been committing.

<p>Right now I'm at the service sitting beside Katy from Dallas First Church. The license plate frames are selling relatively well.  :-)  Nice.

<p><hr width="20%">

<p>2nd workshop. All the youth (almost) are here at the Spirituality workshop with Austin Roth and JoEllen Willis.  Wild to be here finally; I have anticipated this workshop for a long time, like since May at least.

33<p><hr width="20%">

<p>10am Sunday 15 November 1998 (10462)

<p>We're at OKC church after a crazy fun game of Silent Football last night where I finally suspended the game while it was all crazy and said, "YO are we playing a strict game or a crazy game?"
<br>Austin indicated clearly to Jermey that J-man was too disruptive. Game went much more smoothly after that.

<p>Nathan lost and had to fix us breakfast.

<p>This morning we left around 8 and are now at youth group at OKC. They have a cool phat room.

<p>In attendance I know Adam L, Rebecca, Devon A, Austin R, Melissa C, Bryn C, Annie B.  Class has included a Korean man named Peter who is showing us breathing techniques.

<p>Bryn C was the first volunteer.  I was impressed with her seriousness.

<p><hr width="20%">

<p>2:55pm 15 November 1998

<p>kT and I are at ACE of Clubs, as the van developed a slightly flat tier. It's only flat (although completely flat) on the bottom. We began walking at 2:20pm and found a guy at the car wash who is taking Denise and Adam to the van and to Texaco to get the flat fixed. kT and I had the option to gow with them, but have chosen to chill here with our red plastic cups of Coke and birthday woman behind the counter with voice so scratchy it almost hurts me and she's got 3 packs of Misty brand cigarettes and said, "can hardly breathe...so I'll just smoke a cigarette..." and just now said "she got a flat tire on I-35 and...I gave her 10 bucks blah blah blah" From context, I can tell it's not Denise to whom she is referring.  {HACK HACK HACK} "Really I don't have TB or nothin'"    
<br>So much make up and "woke up this morning and saw that fifth of tequila and I was all 'I'm gonna drink it' then I was all 'no I'm not I gotta work.. dammmmn!"
<br>"Girls just wanna have fun" she struts about last night and her black bra is so visible through see-through mosquito netting shirt. "gonna drink that and gonna drink some Jack and gonna drink some tequila..."

<p>I simply don't understand this lifestyle.

<p>On other weird thing is this bar is in a small shopping center with a chiropractor, a speech & occupational & physical therapy center, and a counseling center or something. Wacky.
kT says it's a front.

<p>3:45pm they just got back and Adam sat up beside me at the bar and she just told Adam that he had to be 21 to sit at the bar and kT has been there for 50 minutes.

<p>Now Adam and Denise are playing pool. We are waiting for the wrecker guy who had to go get a new tire from somewhere.

<p>kT got a picture of them playing pool. "Blackmail!  This is going on the internet!"

<p>The peoples around the bar have shifted over to the other side. I wonder if they are consciously or subconsciously moving away from us.

<p><font size="+1">Oh my gosh yesterday Delayna came over to the cabin to hang out with me! I haven't seen her in ten years!  Met her husband and Skye Blu, her little baby!! So great to reconnect with her and stuff.</font>
<br>Never saw Janette. Pooh.

<p>kT is line dancing alone. I guess that is point dancing.

<p><hr width="20%">

<p>2:30 am Monday 16 November 1998 (10463)

<p>Woke up at Denton and drove the rest of the way straight home.  No stops from Denton to Houston.

<p>Goodnight.
