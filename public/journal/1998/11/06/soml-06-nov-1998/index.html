                        <p><title>State of My Life</title></p>

<p class=date>6 November 1998</p>

<h1>STATE OF MY LIFE</h1>

<p><ol>

<p><li>After some meditation, I have determined something. My want is not "to be successful in my own business."  I already knew I don't want a full time job.  
<br>My want is to make some dollars and then have time to travel and play.</li>

<p>So I decided to become a gigilo.  Wait! no. no. just kiddin'.

<p>So I'm looking for some kind of part time consulting work - programming or HTML or whatever, and to that end I have called a couple of people and have put my want out to the universe, and now on my website.

<p>(For those keeping close tabs, I still signed the contract for the register receipt tape advertising on the Kroger stores.  One will begin on 29 December, the other like 21 January 1999.  They will each run for 12 weeks, I think.  I'll scan those and let you know how that all turns out.)

<p><li>My trip to Costa Rica is coming soon to an airport near me!!  I'm super excited about it, and will likely go purchase a camera (instead of borrowing Wende's all the time).  Hey, is Costa Rica flooded and destroyed now as I understand Honduras is? Hmmmm. That might be important to find out.</li>

<p><li>It's gettin' cold here in Houston! Cold by Houston standards -- it's around 60 degrees daily and down in the 50s at night. My cat Spot sleeps with me at night now. Today he climbed into a grocery sack and we play fought through the bag.</li>

<p><li>My ankle is getting better after I messed it up a couple weeks ago jumping over Maggie's couch.</li>

<p><li>I have almost completed my marble-track ball-clock. 
<p>"What the heck is that?" you may ask.

<p>Okay. Um, imagine, if you will, a chrome marble a bit less than one cm in diameter.  Okay, now imagine that marble on two popsicle sticks like on a train track. Tilt the sticks slightly, and it will roll down.

<p>Okay. <em>Now</em> imagine a long track of popsicle sticks with twists and turns and guard rails and a bunch of chrome marbles to roll down it.  That's the "marble-track" part of the project.

<p>Now imagine a novelty clock from like Sharper Image, that has an arm that picks up a marble at the bottom of the clock and drops that marble at the top of the clock exactly once per minute.  The clock has pathways and little levers to line up the marbles and roll them around and it keeps track of time that way. The Sharper Image version of this clock is all black plastic.

<p>My dad got such a clock a long-ass time ago for Christmas - like in the early 80s. Some time later he gave it to my brother who enjoyed it for a while, who gave it back to my dad, and he kept it for a while and then he gave it to me.

<p>I kept the little plastic levers, but I ripped out all the plain boring straight plastic track and have replaced it all with popsicle sticks, toothpicks, and two tongue depressors to hold the whole thing up.  This project started in late September, and I was 2/3rds done by mid October.  Just yesterday I began work again, and will soon complete the whole thing.  (I know the dates because I've written the date on practically each stick as I glued it on.)

<p>If I can, I'll get pictures of it and put them on the site. (It's really small, like 5x5x4 inches, so I'll have to get a close-up focusin' camera.)</li>

<p><li>I've been listening to KTRU, 91.7 Rice Radio, and it's really cool because they play all these obscure unpopular songs, so they have a small listening audience.  Therefore, whenever they give away like movie passes or whatever, I can always win! I got passes to ORGAZMO recently, and just yesterday I won passes to Happiness.  I'll go pick them up today.</li>

<p><li>SCOTT, a band featuring Kris Scott on vocals, guitar, bass, drums and keyboard, just put out a new album. It's got covers of a bunch of different bands: They Might Be Giants, Sonic Youth, Pavement, Radiohead, The Pixies, and others, plus original tunes that express a variety of moods and stuff.  Anyway, that's my plug, and if you want a copy, it's only 5 bucks and supports my friend Kris who is just getting started in the music biz. Email him <a href="mailto:bitter-boy@juno.com">here.</a>

<p><li>Oh, so I forgot to mention the reason I mentioned that is when I go to KTRU to pick up my passes, I'll drop off the latest SCOTT album and get SCOTT on the airwaves!</li>

<p><li>I wrote a resume yesterday.</li>

<p><hr align="center" width="25%">

<p><li>1:29pm same day
<br>I just picked up the passes from KTRU and while at the station
I was all, "do you have to be a student to work here?"   

<p>"No, but preference is given to students.  You might try during Christmas 
break."

<p>!!!! So I'm going to apply to be a DJ at KTRU over the holidays!  Truue!</li>

</ol>

<p>See ya!
