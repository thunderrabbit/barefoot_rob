                        <p><title>Last check from work</title></p>

<p class=date>8 July 1998</p>

<p>After gymnastics yesterday, I was doing email and stuff when Manda called around 11pm.  At 11:30 we met at House of Pies to munch and chat.

<p>We talked about whatever and caught each other up on our current life situations.  We found that we're both busy busy with all kinds of stuff and both need help in the <b>completion of goals</b> department.  So we decided to act as cheerleaders for eachother, making sure we get our respective stuff done.

<p>We ended up talking in the parking lot till about 2am at which point we both were like, "holy shit it's 2am!" and we vacated.

<p>I woke up <em>bing</em> at 8:55am.  Whew!  I was supposed to be working at 9am in the Lodge with Roy.  I got there late, but it was okay.  We got finished in 1 day what he expected to take 2: I pasted together the phone directories for all the men in the organization. I used copy tape and made corrections and pasted together all the pages in "book order."

<p>Just because I could, I cut out and repasted my name in the directory so it was slightly out of line with the other names.  Just like 1 character offset just to emphasize it a bit.

<p>I took the final product to CopyMax so they could make 600 directories.  While there Susan Joplin called me on my cell phone and we talked for like 15 minutes while the guy behind the counter calculated the cost.

<p>After Copy Max, to Telecheck I drove to pick up my last check.

<p>I parked in the bowels of the Galleria (big shopping center across the street) and walked barefoot to through Saks Fifth Avenue, which was cool just because.

<p>(My friend John has wondered about the existence of Saks Fifth Avenue.  "Where did all those people come from?"
<br>"What do you mean?" I asked. 
<br>"I mean, they seem like they're from a different planet or something..."
<br>To some degree I have to agree.)

<p>Called Maggie to let me in on the 9th floor and said HI to everyone and described how thrillfully happy I've been and more productive and all that.  Totally amazing.

<p>I picked up my last check for 3 weeks worth of pay and vacation and stuff.  Dave told me that the afternoon I left (not serving my two weeks' notice) upper management immediately said, "no more getting paid 2 weeks severance pay if they don't work!"

<p>That included my friend Jeff Alfonso, who gave his notice the same day I did.  He had to work 2 weeks.  I give thanks to my higher Self and guides and stuff.  SmooooOOOooooch!!
