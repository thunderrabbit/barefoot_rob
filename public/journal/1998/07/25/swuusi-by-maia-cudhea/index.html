<hr>

<pre>

i can't believe no one reviewed swuusi.  so i'll do it belatedly.
okay, here's what i remember several months later.

i got to camp really late saturday night, and the rest of staff was way
already there.  my hair was all done up from my sister's wedding (why i
was late) and i was so tired.  so we had this quick meeting and said we'd
do everything else tomorrow and i went to sleep on a table.  this was the
last time i was at a comfy temperature for many moons.  
next thing i know, kris is waking me up babbling something about the
perfect arrangement of cabins he and aaron worked on all night.  i was
all, okay kris.  so i helped everyone move beds from cabin to cabin for a
while, which was hot dirty work.

then people start arriving way before we're ready.  so me and ashley haul
ass to get touch groups done and registration ready while evryone else
works on other camp stuff.  registration is this big blur, but i remember
this awesome buddy-program thing we did for newcomers that worked great
and everyone was having a blast.
we did the opening circle thing and then i went ot bed.  i was soooo
tired.
this crazy bedlam of fun stuff and extreme exhaustion on my part and all
these mini-crisis persisted all week, so it's kind of hazy.  but some
stuff stands out

i remember swimming one night and playing this awesome game of water
volleyball where no one really cared or had teams, we just hit the ball
and laughed and splashed and had mad fun.  and i remember the awesome
food aaron and kris and anne worked out, with decent veggie food,
considering we were in nowhere, OK.  
and i remember the awesome power shuffle workshop taylor (used to be
mandi) led.  everybody cried and it was this big emotional cool as all
hell thing.
and i remember shopping for prizes for the touch group trash hunt with
debbi at wal mart. i swear we walked up and down every freakin aisle and
our feet hurt and our tummies hurt from laughing.  and then we were
stuffing ramen noodles in these little boxes and thought it was so cool.
and i remember the social action thing with east side renasisance that
came off so well, even though i was afraid it was gonna fall apart at the
last second.  and how ya'll all busted your butts in hot weather and most
of you found out you had a good time.
and i remember going to shoney's and finding out the guy we told we were
coming in didn't tell anyone else, but how they were really nice anyways.
 and we had so much fun stinky from working in public.
and i remember probably having the only comfy place to sleep, cause bryn
had this box fan by her bed and never slept, so i sat it on her bed and
had a breeze all night.
and we had an awesome game of silent football with bunches of people,
that did degenerate into chaos so i left.
and remember laughing till i almost peed when kris told me about the game
of capture the flag and the "leah song" and breaking out of jail.
and i remember the awesome theme speaker and super worships and great
adults and cool workshops and neato special events and the killer
community.

thanks for all the great memories guys.  love you.
