<p class=date>7pm Thursday 30 July 1998</p>
<font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font>

<p>Wow holy cow went to breakfast and then Drake's workshop and back to the cabin and was just about to hop into the shower when someone walked in. I went to see who it was: a woman, a new face, so I said "HI" and then realized holy cow it's Karen!!

<p>big big big hugs and we briefed one another on our respective weeks so far and sat down to talk and stuff and after about 5 or 8 minutes she said simply, "are you okay?  you seem sad."

<p>Now, she is the nth person to say this lately and I was all, "????".  . .   So I settled into my emotions and Manda came up. I would like to date her but cannot since she is dating someone else. I feel all confused and in love with Manda, but trying not to piss off Wende and I just don't know what to do. So we went for a walk.

<p>On the way toward the main cabin I saw Janette (and her delightful braces), who I met and flirted with at the Young Adult retreat back in May. I told her I was going for a walk.

<p>She attempted to acknowledge what I said, "do I wanna go for a walk?"

<p>"No, I'm going for a walk," <em>stab - twist - salt</em> and then I thought <em>oh god that sounded terrible</em> and I didn't know what to say.

<p>But Karen and I walked and talked and she listened well and I made the realization that I want to get married so the woman I marry can take care of me, instead of me taking care of myself.

<p>wow. I replaced those thoughts with affirmations
<br>I do not need someone else to take care of me.
<br>I can take care of myself.
<br>I can nurture myself and love myself.
<br>I do nurture and love myself.

<p>More big hugs and then back to the main camp where Janette was no longer. Karen asked if I would call her if I needed to talk more.. I said probably not, but I heard and appreciate the invitation.

<p>Hugs and she left and I ate lunch. There I saw Jason Fricke's mom and told her how cool Jason was. She made my day, saying that I've really made a positive difference in Jason's life.  Yay!

<p>then I saw ohmygosh Colleen Crotty and Meghan Cusack and other junior high youth from the main camp, just over to check out the high school camp. I said HI to them and to Barbara, who said the girls now wished they had chosen the high school camp instead of junior high.

<p>Some of the youth asked if I would go swim, and I readily agreed and went down to the lake. On the way there, Nathan tried to get me to lead a junior high pack of youth and I was all, "no way; I'm goin' swimming!" and he's all "what kind of advisor are you?"  I immediately replied, "high school!"

<p>Okay that may have been cold, but it sure fit.

<p>At the lake, Wende rode around in the water on my back and then Jason was on my shoulders and we had chicken fights.  He and I pretty much kicked ass many times in a row until I was finally too sore to keep it up.

<p>After swimming we attended a workshop called "Power Shuffle" which, oh my goodness-- if you ever get a chance to do it, do it.
Major major powerful emotions and tears and tears and love and a greatly tightened community at the end.

<p>Enormous hugs to Anna to whom I had written a letter during Drake's workshop and hugged lotsa youth and then Amy Moran walked up. 

<p>"We found some baby birds and one has been injured."

<p>Went to see what they had and it turns out they had found small ducklings that were plenty able to walk and squeak and take care of themselves... 'cept that there was no parent duck in sight.  Hmmm.

<p>I suggested leaving them alone so we did.

<p>Now it's shower time for me.  First time since Sunday morning.
