<p class=date>early Thursday 30 July 1998</p>
<br><font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font>

<p>Super tired waking up this morning but opening circle and then breakfast was good pancakes and stuff then I couldn't stay awake for Drake's Theme Workshop so I went back to bed.

<p>Woke up for lunch around 2pm, missing "Whack The YAC" which I didn't entirely mind since I didn't want to get whacked, whatever that might entail.

<p>Then the themed Gansta Lunch, serving Soup Doggie Dog, Method Manwich, Notorious BLT, and to drink Wu-Tang and Ice-T with Ice Cubes.  I notice we didn't have any Vanilla Ice cream.

<p>Then at 3pm we zipped off via buses to the main activity of the day, social action work at the city of Ardmore. I grabbed my towel and sunscreen and hopped on the first bus, which was pretty full, but Nathan motioned for me to come sit by him in Jessica's seat. 

<p>Sat and talked and played and the ride wasn't too far, but once we got to where we were going, funny was, "hey a train!" I yelled, referring to 1 engine with 1 car driving up to the RR crossing, causing the arms to go down and then it stopped and zipped backwards to pick up 1 more car!

<p>My touchgroup's job (I haven't been to a single touch group meeting) was to help clean up behind a house thing with 30 years worth of debris collected behind it - car hoods, a car roof, a syringe, old birdbaths, bones, old carpet, fully intact fully rotted sections of fence, car engine parts, car tires and brush and trees up to about 4 inches in diameter plus 1 log about 8 feet long and 1 foot in diameter, so rotted that it was light enough for two people to carry...  

<p>And we saved the metal and tires and concrete birdbaths, but threw the rest away into a huge dumpster like 7 feet tall by 7 feet wide and 20 feet long (and started to fill another smaller dumpster.. We cleared about a 50 by 50 square foot section of land behind this place from all this overgrown craziness down to essentially bare dirt.  Wow.  Got into the local paper with pictures and everything.

<p>Good hard work and carried away the trees that our leader guy chainsawed and it was all good.

<p>Birdbaths were there because the building behind the building used to make them.

<p>Cleaned up my hands and face and head and then piled back onto the buses to ride to Shoney's and sat by Shawn Oiler, then sat in the very back of Shoney's after being the first one to walk in, "I'd like a table for 80 please."  "Go right on to the back," and they had a section blocked off ready for us.

<p>I sat in the back corner and Josh, Jessica, and Laura sat with me. Jessica taught us a rhythmic cup clap tap thing and we practiced and learned it and will do it at the talent show tomorrow night.

<p>We all performed the sufi dance from the previous night while waiting for service. 

<p>Lotta fun and laughs and sign language as Josh got jinxed and couldn't talk until someone spoke his name, but he was as expressive through sign language as anyone else might be verbally. 

<p>I ate four plates from the salad bar and Josh didn't get his food until it was time to go.

<p>Back to the buses I sat in the back and bounced and played, "it's been 10 or 11 years since I've been on a bus! I'm sittin' in the back!" I exclaimed to Nathan who said something crazy like, "advisors don't sit in the back!"

<p>Sat by Laura and we practiced the cup thing and re-enacted the sufi dance even again and waved to cars through the back window. That wasn't totally fun since it was too dark to see their reactions.

<p>Back to camp and then worship was a Love Feast "the rules are you cannot talk, and you cannot feed yourself" and Jason fed me a marshmallow pile and I took forever chewing that. The worship was short and sweet and then it was time for me to rove again.

<p>20 youth were playing Capture the Flag; 21 youth were at the lake; and various others were scattered throughout the camp and finally I accounted for everyone and found a youth who was not feeling too good. This youth suffered from a broken heart and I sat and listened to the story.

<p>Then Travis asked if I would shave his head and I agreed (I knew from previously that his mom had said it was okay) and as we walked to the cabin to shave his head I was invited to play Silent Football. Cool.

<p>So I carefully shaved his head and was certain to put shoes on before throwing the hair out in the woods. Then I joined the game with Nick Carter as Mr Dictator, who allowed individual players to slightly change their names, which got me 1/2 of a penance point as I called Sister Maia "Ms Maia" instead.

<p>Kris Scott as "Father Scott" was hilarious acting all holy and righteous and stuff and Nick took two pictures of him during his righteous tirades. The game deteriorated as all kinds of rules were broken and I couldn't begin to keep up with everything and I was getting pretty tired, so I left the game around 5am to sleep.

<p>Woke up before opening circle and wrote notes from the previous day and just now wrote all this during breakfast though I was really hungry and ready to eat.
