<p class=date>4pm Tuesday 28 July 1998</p>
<font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font>

<p>Missed Spirit Circle tody and I certainly didn't want to do that; I had wanted to compliment the youth on how well they are drinking plenty of water and to keep it up.

<p>I did make breakfast though, and then Drake Baer (theme speaker) workshop, during which I wrote a mythical story about how The Feel Good Net got started.

<p>Morning workshops and then I went swimming from 1:25pm to essentially now.  Played with Jason some but had to leave to take Debi's car back (said Wende) even though I was wet and Wende was dry, but I took her car back and walked back to the lake with Frank and two beach balls. Drake started to walk with us, but by about 1/2 way there, he turned back, realizing the sun was just going to be too much for his New Jersey acclimated self.

<p>Jason left by the time I got back and I felt some sadness; I still wanted to play!

<p>Instead played a small game of bouncing one of the balls with Andy Andrews (advisor) and then we began collecting small rocks from the bottom of the lake. He identified them to the best of his knowledge. Most of them were some type of sandstone. We also found some opaque smokey quartz. Jessica came over and helped us collect some, and we put them all on the dock for safe keeping.

<p>Also found a stick that looks not entirely like a turtle head when it is poking out of the water.
