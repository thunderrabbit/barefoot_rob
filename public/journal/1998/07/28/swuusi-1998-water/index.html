<p class=date>2:30am Tuesday 28 July 1998</p>
<font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font>

<p>This morning, Jason and I played lots in the lake again, chicken fights and acrobatics of whatever sort we could come up with including Jessica on Jason's shoulders while Jason on my shoulders. We tried some 6-person pyramids, but couldn't get them to work.

<p>We played keep away from Maia with Maia's hat and sunglasses. Actually I did play a bit, but tried to keep the group to remain respectful of her stuff.

<p>Then I took a phat nap before lunch.

<p>Water activity workshop after dark designed by Jen Colbert, included water balloon tossing and a big slip-n-slide.  Frank and I used raquet looking things each with a net to catch the balloons. I think we did quite well considering how dark it was.

<p>Ate plenty of ice cream after dinner.

<p>Then worship led by Tiffany Schneider was basically "break up into groups and talk about your beliefs." I expressed pretty verbosely what I believed and how my beliefs had changed throughout the years.  Afterward, I felt honored when Sean Murray said, "I had always wondered what Rob believed."  Wow.

<p>Back to main cabin for more ice cream and I loved sitting with an informal group listening to <a href="https://www.geocities.com/sunsetstrip/studio/4367">Kris Scott</a> live in concert, guitar and singing his various favorites and taking requests. He is really good and I look forward to seeing his performance career develop beautifully, not to mention purchasing his third tape when it comes out.

<p>Swam after dark and Susan accompanied me both to and from the lake. On the way up there, she held my hand and looked up at the stars the entire way there. On the way back, I held her hand and walked with my eyes closed the entire way back.

<p>Said HI to Chris Anderson, who had a CD pumping loudly from his car.  A german band with a name I can't begin to remember, but which he could pronounce surprisingly well.

<p>Bed now.
