                        <p><title>ice slidin&rsquo; at Hermann Park</title></p>

<p class=date>9 July 1998</p>

<p><br><font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font></p>

<p>I webpaged until 6:45pm and zipped off to Hermann Park (sp) and Miller Outdoor Theater where a guy stopped me to say HI.  It was Vincent who I had met at Fred Haas Toyota back in June!

<p>He seems more friendly than I'm really interested in, but I gave him my phone number at his request.

<p>Then Rhoda drove up with Zach from Thoreau Congregation and said HI and the Magwoods from Northwoods arrived and we all went to the top of the hill and were chillin' and relaxin' for our Wednesday night bring-your-own-picnic dinner on the hill.

<p>I hadn't brought any food and they inquired.  I said, "I'm embarassed to say I got home at 4pm after not having eaten and then totally chowed and now I'm not hungry."

<p>They understood and I ate a bit of Jim's fabulous cookin' and then what the hell this huge noise was all

<h1><em>RUUuuurururRRRURRURrurrur</em></h1>

<p>behind us and a truck drove up the hill and turned and water pooouured out the back and the guys parked and dropped off $48 worth of 1 cubic foot blocks of ice!!!

<p>While they were popping them out of the truck, about 20 youth with towels (good hitchhikers) walked up the hill.  
<br>Weird.

<p>They hovered around the ice and I walked up. I skipped the formalities. "HI. What are you doing?"

<p>"We're going to slide down the hill on the ice!"

<p>Soon the truck drove off and we joined their group and had a super incredible awesome fun time!!!

<p><em>zzziiiiingggggggggg</em> down the hill with cold cold butt and hold on tight and be prepared to tumble but it was funnnn!!!!
So much like the time so long ago when Gary Strouz and I had slid down that hill on our butts during a sudden rainstorm while we had been playing disc golf.

<p>Fun fun Fun past dark and everyone had to go but I stayed back and stacked up 9 blocks of ice that had not been smashed by the youth after the sliding festivities.  I wonder what people thought if/when anyone found them.

<p>I brought home the 1 piece I had been sliding on.
