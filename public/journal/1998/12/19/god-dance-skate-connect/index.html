                        <p><title>god, Y2K, dance, skate, connect, all in one day!</title></p>

<p class=date>1:11pm Saturday 19 December 1998 (10496)</p>

<p><br><font size="-1">(transcribed from my diary)</font></p>

<p>I just spent 2 hours online doing email and updating website and the SWD YRUU website.

<p>Yesterday was asesome! To kick it off, Glen called me back and was super exciting about signing up with Flashnet!  yay!!

<p>Then Ben Easton and I went skating around Rice University, got kicked off (gently) by a Rice Cop and went to eat at Bibas and discussed Y2K predictions, and our philosophies of god and cosmology. Ben explained logically why angels exist, but that god does not.

<p>Then to his house with the plan of some combination of talking, or watching <em>2001: A Space Odessey</em>, which he could hardly believe I had never seen.  (He has a framed poster for the movie in his living room)

<p>We talked for 2.5 hours, actually mostly he talked and described long windedly why he is for the death penalty. Something to the effect of, "it's our right to remove people who are a threat to society."  I debated, but didn't seem to make much of an impression.

<p>Then I went home a chilled a bit then met Sara at UH for an AH (American Humanics) party at the UC (University Center).  I met James and talked to him and we helped them get set up including walking to the Social Work building where AH is located via a semi-secret back door of the UC, labeled "Emergency Exit Only"
Much to people's surprise, there is no alarm on the door and we propped it open with some flyers so we could get back in.

<p>Back to the dance for an awards ceremony, then jazz music (ho hum) then Beastie Boys "Brass Monkey" which got me and Sara onto the dance floor then "Paul Revere" then some disco and by then a lot of the group was up dancing and we formed a Soul Train dance line and had a great time.  I even got Tinette's grandma to dance!

<p>I danced bouncily for like 1 hour including non-stop bouncing on my toes to the beat of House of Pain's "Jump Around" for the entire song.  <font face="arial" size="+1">GOD</font> my calves are sore!

<p>Left the party and called Manda who was still out and about. I almost went back to the party as a "poor me" reaction then realized that's not what I wanted. So I went home and put on my skates to skate downtown.

<p>It was 11pm, and I suddenly thought, Diane! and called her and turns out she was available to skate so we met downtown at our parking lot. I skated there and she drove.

<p>We skated around the streets, which was a tad challenging as they were a tad wet, and wound our way down to Bayou Place, (a brand new facility, including sweet movie theaters, 2 or 3 restaurants, a concert auditorium, a bar or 2, and valet parking, which is Houston's wonderful successful beginnings of getting a night life back downtown) and asked one of the outdoor bars for water and they were happy to oblige.

<p>We chilled like sweaty sore thumbs on skates in the middle of a well dressed yuppy theater district and I loved it!  We thanked the waiter and I tried to tip him but he said "don't do that; just come back later and eat."

<p>Across the street we went to gaze upon Buffalo Bayou, which was a tad overflowed (4 feet lower than what Jason and I had seen 2 days after it had been 25 feet overflowed) and I decribed to Diane how deep it had been.

<p>Amanda called at that moment on my cell phone and we made plans to meet back at Biba's (how ironic that I went twice in 1 day after not going there for over a year).  Diane and I slowly made our way back toward her car, which was about 12 blocks away at this point.

<p>Got to Biba's and magic happened when Diane and Manda met. Not like romance magic, but they connected on a professional level: Diane is a real estate agent looking to expand her business, and Amanda has had interest in getting her real estate license, but didn't really know how and <b>bing</b> it was amazing!

<p>They talktalktalktalked and I just ate my Greek Pizza and cleaned up the phone number list stored in my cell phone, keeping an ear toward the conversation.

<p>At one point, I pointed out that within 1 week of when Diane and I first met, I went to a palm reading party that she hosted which forever changed my life in a wonderfully positive way. I greatly hope the same type of impact happens for Diane and Amanda.

<p>Manda and I went home around 1:30am then slept in on this lazy Saturday.
