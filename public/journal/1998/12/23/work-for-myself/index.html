<p>Today I am 10500 days old!  Yay!!!!!!

<p>This past Monday at I-group I realized that I felt unproductive in my life. We worked down to the base of the fear and found that I felt like I don't have enough money to do anything, including not being able to get a job. Then the fear spirals downward: no money = no car = no job = no apartment = no life = me alone with nothing in the world.

<p>"Well why don't I just get a job?" was the next basic question. Oddly enough, I'm not that desperate yet.

<p>Yeah, yeah, none of this makes sense, but the dark recesses of my brain seldom do.

<p>So the next question was asked -- one that wasn't quite as obvious to me.  "If I'm not willing to work for someone else, am I at least willing to work for myself?"

<p>Yes, in fact I am.

<p>"Are you willing to make a list of things to do, and put deadlines on it?"

<p>Deadlines?  Novel idea.  Yes, in fact I am.

<p>So I changed my mindset to one of proactivity, I made my list, starting with wake up at 8am, shower, dress, eat, make a list of things to do that day, prioritize them, designated deadlines, then work on it until 2pm.  (Gotta start slow)

<p>But I didn't start all that slowly.  I made my list that night (puttin' in overtime before I even go to work!) and prioritized it and got started on Tuesday morning with vigor and enthusiasm!

<p>I finished nine-tenths of the As on my list, plus spent 3 hours at Telecheck, talking and reconnecting with everyone.  I was greeted with nothing but handshakes and hugs and kudos and even sold some FlashNet accounts!

<p>I spent a significant amount of time talking to Donna, who seemed quite impressed with my general outlook on life and stuff. I learned that she skates some as well, so maybe we'll go skating downtown sometime!

<p>I was doubly pleased and honored when talking to Pat, she said she felt inspired by my example of getting out of debt and being able to travel. Wow!! I felt so good and encouraged her to follow her dream: "you can do it!"

<p>Then I drove way over to the east side of Houston and picked up some ceramic "bricks" for my gas heater.  They were $14.98 each!  I bought 3 to replace the ones that have cracked and broken over the years.

<p>It was fully 3:30pm when I got home, and I took a happy nap with my rennovated heater.

<p>Today I have been working on the Bs on my list, including ordering plane tickets via Jayne my travel agent to go see Jen in New Hampshire, via the aiport in Manchester, via Newark, NJ, via Continental Airlines!  Yay!  That will be in Feb 1999.

<p>And today I scanned some pictures...
