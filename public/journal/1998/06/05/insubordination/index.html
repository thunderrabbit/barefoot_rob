<p class=date>5 June 1998</p>

<p>(all the names (except mine) have been changed)

<p>Yesterday, Jill, my four-level-up superior at work came around saying HI. She went through so fast that I thought she wasn't actually saying HI but counting to make sure we were all here by the official must-be-here-by-9:30am time.

<p>I mentioned to Dan (a manager) that I felt that way. He encouraged me to tell her how I felt.

<p>So I wrote her the following message.  I tried to state clearly my feelings, the data I saw, my judgement, and my wanted desire for the whole situation.

HI

I feel sadness with a hint of anger today, after I saw you wisk
through the cubicles and say "I'm just saying HI"

My guess is that you are counting people to get a general idea of
who is here at 9:30, not that you are saying "HI"

I would appreciate you saying "I'm counting people" if you are
counting people, or I would appreciate you actually stopping to
say "HI" if you are saying HI.

I would feel happier working here if I saw your actions match
your words.

This is her reply:

If you want to say something like this to me, why don't you come
by & say it to my face instead of with email? 

Trust me if I was counting heads I would say that; I wasn't even
aware of what time it was. I miss getting a chance to get around
each day so I was happy (until I received this) that I had that
opportunity to do it today. Since my time is so taken I can't
stop and chat with each person, when there are so many, so I try
to vary who I stop & talk with each time I go around. This way
over time I get to talk with everyone; this wasn't your time. If
you perfer, I won't say hi next time.

I have cc Marty so he will be aware of YOUR actions.

<p>I felt a bit of fear (even though I am quitting in two weeks anyway, none of the above mentioned people know this.)...
<br>so anyway, I felt a bit of fear that I'm going to be fired. I went to her office to talk.

<p>She said that I essentially accused her of lying (about what she was doing) stealing (stealing time from me) and that I questioned her integrity.

<p>She said this was clearly insubordination and that it was not to be tolerated in the business world.

<p>She called in Pete and Marty, my boss' boss, and his boss, respectively.

<p>She told them the same thing, and asked their opinion. Marty said that I could have said it in a different way.

<p>She said this was a warning, but that it would go in my file, and that if I did it again, "I will personally terminate you."

<p>"Thank you," I said, looking clearly into her eyes.

<p>"Do you understand what I am saying?"

<p>I did. "Yes I do."

<p>I tried again to articulate that I used the same protocol that I use with great respect in my men's group meeting: Clearly state feeling, data, judgement, and want.

<p>She didn't seem to feel any better about it.  She said that before I made such a rash decision with such little data, that I should have at least asked my boss what he thought.

<p>She also said something like, "this will stay between the 4 of us and don't mention it to anyone else." 

<p>At this point I told her clearly that I did not talk to any of my bosses because they were not available at the time, but that I had seen Dan and I talked to him.

<p>"And what did he say?"

<p>Almost trembling, I said, "he suggested that I write to you."

<p>She nodded her head.

<p>She asked if there was anything else, and we all said "no" or said nothing.  "Okay then."  Meeting over.  I left, closing the door, while Marty and Pete stayed in her office.

<p>So I left, and told Dan how I mentioned his name.  He said he'll talk to her.  We'll see what happens.

<p>I'm still leaving in two weeks.

<p>TWO!!!!</p>
