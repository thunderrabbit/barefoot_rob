                        <p><title>Mucky Duck and Brewery Tap</title></p>

<p class=date>1:40am Friday 12 June 1998</p>

<p>Last night (Wednesday night) I went to the Mucky Duck and hung out with Christine and some of my old friends who I haven't seen in 4 or 5 years since my days hanging out in the dorms at University of Houston.

<p>We talked about all variety of stuff and barely caught glimpses of each other's lives..  They've been seeing each other at Mucky Duck each Wednesday for some time now, so it was catch up time for me.

<p>Most wonderful for me was to see Melanie, on whom I had a tremendous crush back in the day (and I never told her).. and the reason it was so cool to see her is that I was able to talk to her coherently.  My tongue worked correctly and my brain worked correctly, and everything was all good.  I still think she's worthy of a crush, but at least now I can see her also as a person, and as an equal.
<br>Nice.

<p>Then Christine and I were gonna go to The Brewery Tap, and she left and I went to my car and oops... I was blocked in by another car.  

<p>So I went inside to ask the guys on stage (therefore with microphones) to ask whoever it was to move their car.  As I walked up there, <em>bing!</em>, I saw Chris, who I met at Studios and Stages two months ago!  How wonderfully random to re-link with him... it was especially cool because he is just about to move back to Canada; I saw him like a week before he and his wife leave.

<p>A few minutes passed and I went back to my car and was still blocked in, but lo, it turns out there had been a person in the culprit-car the whole time.  Wow.

<p>My brain did a happy floop, noticing how the details of my life were meshing, unfolding beautifully before me.  I love it!

<p>I drove to The Brewery Tap, where I met someone who shall (at least for the time being) remain nameless, and I talked with her 'till 3am.  It was all nice and stuff and we didn't kiss until I drove her to her house and she invited me in and we ate ice cream and though my more-patient-more-thoughtful brain said "no," we ended up kissing and having sex but it was pretty crummy cause it was 5am and I was so fucking tired (no pun intended).

<p>I got home by 6am and didn't feel too hot about myself or the whole situation and I crashed until 9:30 when the sun felt pretty hot and I had to get up and go to work anyway.

<p>Ug.
