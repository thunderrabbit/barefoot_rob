                        <p>1998 Oklahoma City Rally (in) review by <a href=mailto:brynisgod@aol.com>Bryn "Bean" Cain</a></p>

<hr>

<p>Its beAn two weeks, but I'll start from Friday night and see where it gets me.

<p>First thing I remember was Eryn Pope, Austin Roth, Nora and I were all
sitting outside in the courtyard around 8-8:30 just layin on each others
tummies talkin, Nora is from Germany (as you all know) so we were
askinh er
all sorts of silly questions about Germany, and Austin was talkin about
tummies, and it was just jolly fun.

<p> Eventually after about 15 minutes of that, Susanne came outside to
tell us
Stillwater was here! YEAH!! I ran inside to see my '97 SWUUSI friends
Clark
and Noah.  I was so happy to see them, and quickly showed them around
and put
on some music, and everyone danced for about 30 minutes, it was
glorious fun,
and I loved re-kindling my friendships w/ Clark and Noah.

<p>        They were really thirsty, so we made our way to the kitchen to make
coffee,
oh goodness, this was a task.  After about 5 minutes of looking for the
coffee, we found it behing the coffee maker. (right where Noah said it
would
be)  None of us knew how to use the machine, so we just kind of
guessed.  We
found a filter, and put it, somewhere, and put the coffee grounds
somewhere
else, and poured some water somewhere else, and well, eventually, we
got water
everywhere and ruined a packet of coffee, oops. 

<p>        I left for a few minutes to see what else was happening around the
church, I
was afraid they'd kill me if I stayed in there any longer, and when I
got back
Clark had the machine up and running, and he used it the whole weekend,
that
boy loves coffee, and loves to spill it on others.  

<p>        After making the coffee, they played around with the big wooden ladel
for a
while, then tryed to spray each other with the water shooter, but
eventually,
and after I had to kick 'em out of the kitchen, we got bored being
inside and
went outside to chill.

<p>        Noah is quite the climber, so he had no trouble making it to the top
of the
tree in the courtyard faster than lightning.  We were all gasping and
gazing.a
Only problem was, we couldn't get him to come down!!! 

<p>        Finally he made his wy down the tree, and just sat with us till more
people
arrived.  The next people to arrive were the Mckeons and well, half of
Fort
Worth.   They went in and took their pictures, and we all sat down to
Susanne's wonderful guitar playing.  We sang Cat Stevens, and the
Beatles
mostly, with a little extra stuff thrown in on the sides.  Noah was
playing my
drum, and Misty (the dog from Stillwater) was just runnin around being
cute, I
love to sing, and Susanne is great, so that exceptionally nice.

<p>                After a while, and all at one time it seems, a whole big group of
faces got
here from San An and Fort Worth.  One of them my SWUUSI '96 friend
Nathan
Sexton from Fort Worth.  They all come in, and lots of hugs were given,
introductions were made, and after spinning around the floor for a very
long
time, and showing Lauren Dodski from San An where she'd be sleeping, we
went
back to Daniel Hall for more dancing, a little Hokey Pokey, and more
people,
and more introductions, it was crazy, and so much fun.  

<p>        All of this went on for several hours, and eventually when it seemed
like
everyone who was coming was here, we sat down for opening circle. 
Mairead and
Jeanne did an OK job explaing rules and stuff, but when Frank tried to
say the
co-theme (You got screwed by one smooth vacuum while Debe did OKC on a
big
ball of twine in front of Sgt. Bills army surplus + tools, then Adam
got bit
by a dog.) He messed up, and Melissa had to cover for him. After the
opening
speeches, and everyone going around and saying their names with an
adjective
starting with the same letter as their name (you know the game) we all
seperated into TOUCH GROUPS. 

<p>        I was in the red touch group, Sean Murray, touch group leader.  My
touch
group consisted of Me, Noah Weatherford, Mojo Norman, Sean Murray,
Christina
Lusk, Tommy Faitak, and Arlene Dormio. (I think thats all)  

<p>        We had some interesting conversations, but nothing to keep us too
entertained, so we decided to go do some walking.

<p>        I went outside looking for anyone I knew, and ended up sitting on the
benches
to talk.  Clark, Noah, Nathan, Lisa (from Stillwater), and some other
people
whose names don't spring to mind talked for a while, and pretty much
just
bonded.  

<p>        Sometime later I went inside to hang out with Rob, Jen Colbert, Katie,
Kat,
and Nathan.  We talked about lots of stuff, mostly how its my first
rally, and
music, and just lots of wild stuff, it was great Rob spent forever
trying to
get Kaite's last name right, sad to say, he was unsuccesful, but it was
fun to
watch him try so hard.  

<p>        After many minutes of talking, we decided to do some more walking and
ended
up outside on the steps w/ Clark and Noah. We stayed there for I guess
about 3
hours, just talking and chttin it up, but we got cold, so I went and
got my
sleeping bag, as did everyone else, and as we snuggled up to sleep, we
realized (sadly), that there wasn't room for 5.  So Nathan and I went
and
slept beside the benches.  Nathan on my feet keeping them warm (thanks
again
Nathan).  

<p>        I woke up about an hour later to the sound of Adam Lock and others
telling
sexual and racist jokes.  It was a great way to wake up.  Clark, Noah,
Kat,
and Katie, weren't asleep, so I went and talked to them, but
eventually, they
passed out so I walked inside with Aaron Ivener, and he and I split a
blueberry bagel for breakfast.  I went back outside, but no-ones
conversation
was entertaining me, so I woke up Nathan, and he and I explored the
church
hidden under his magic sleeping bag.  

<p>        On the second floor, we picked up Dennis Kalman, and dragged him down
to
breakfast. (what can we say, the boy looked hungry.)  Then we walked
around
the outside of the church, just checkin out the beautiful spring trees,
and
flowers we were just bein silly. 

<p>        After that, we went and sat on the outside stairs, and talked for a
couple
hours w/ everyone else.  Nathan is quite the massuse, so he gave about 6
backrubs to just everyone.  It was great.  Once the sun was completely
up, We
got tired, so we went back to sleep.  

<p>        I woke up about an hour later, but Nathan was still asleep, so I went
inside
to talk to everyone.  Austin, John, and some others were playing drums
inside,
and there was a huge circle of guitarists outside, along with all the
smokers.

<p>        Everyone still seemed to be on the steps, so there I went.  Not sure
what
happended next, but eventually, Nathan, Clark, Andy Artus, Austin Artus,
Gavin, and I all started playing football, with a tiny little thing
that was
eventually popped *but not by us* Gavin and Clark tryed multiple times
to
catch the ball while skateboarding..... it didn't work too well, but
man did
they look hilarious.  

<p>        Soon Clark, Nathan and I all got in a little catch circle to play
around with
Austin.  He refused to throw me the ball making me feel horrible, but
its ok.

<p>        After a  while of that, a frisbee appeared and we ran to make its
aquaintance.  Nathan and I played a while, until Misty insisted on
playing.
Nathan tryed throwing the frisbee to Misty, but after she caught it she
wouldn't give it back to him.  They wrestled around with the frisbee
for a
while, until eventually Nathan threw the frisbee and we ran inside to
hide. 

<p>        A few of us then went into the "loungin" room to watch anime.  I don't
really
like anime, but someone was giving me a back massage so I was happy. 
But
then, Nick felt like ruining my day, and turned my over, and PHUUFed
me!!!!!!!
AHH!!!! It was crazy!! I didn't know what to say! I was giggling like
crazy,
because I'm so ticklish, it was a lot better than I thought it would
be, but
oh my goodness, it was crazy!  The about 15 minutes later FRANK PHUUFed
me
too!!!!!  This was getting rediculous, so we left and went back to
Daniel
Hall.  Nathan Ryan took some time to show me the YAC rally books, and
explain
some of the cool stuff in it to me.  He also showed me the new book,
and gave
me the honor of signing it.

<p>        We came back outside, and I started hacky sackin' with a few random
people,
but I suck, so I stopped after a bit.  It was really, really hot
outside,
everyone was burnin' like bacon, so we took our sleeping bags and went
and
laid out on the grass.  After that, I went and talked to Jeremy
Loomis-Noris,
Chris Anderson, and some other people about crazy stuff, a few of the
people
sitting with us were painting their nails, but I couldn't keep my eyes
of
Chris's cool body painting, maybe it was just cause hes so cute. hee hee

<p>        I went inside because, I think,  it was time for dinner, YUM! I hadn't
eaten
much lunch so I was smilin.  I came outside with my food and sat down
next to
Keith on the bench across from Jeremy.  After getting into a long
debate with
Jeremy about why I think Lettuce tastes like strawberries, (which it
does) and
how I was horrible at eating spaghetti, I felt very silly, so we went
inside
to contra dance.  

<p>        I only danced the warm-up dance, but I used to contra all the time so
I did
ok.  Noah was behind me though, and he kept tripping me and at one
point made
me fall down bringing a line of people with me, it was crazy,
embarassing, and
great fun!      After that we went outside and snuggled under sleeping
bags for
what seemed like forever. They started playing music outside, the first
song I
remember was Prodigy, along w/ Vanilla Ice, and MC Hammer. Jen Colbert
and I
had dancing urges, and couldn't stop, so we danced forever, making
complete
fools of ourselves, even though Scotty Hakel repeatedly told us to
stop.  It
was great.  Everyone was dancing, and having a blast.  I started hiding
under
my magic sleeping bag, but everyone kept finding me, so I said "oh
well" and
stopped hiding.         After contra, Kitty Rankin had gotten a cool little
disco
thing goin down stairs so we all moved down there to dance. Everyone
got bored
quickly, with somewhat luke-happy music, and after about 5 minutes, we
all
moved back upstairs.  So we sat again, and talked again, and after a
couple
hours of this, someone came out and told us it was almost time for
worship.  

<p>         We went in the childrens chapel to a candle lit room. Nathan Ryan put
us in
two circles, and we all went around telling everyone what we wished
they would
say to us. It was extremely great and everyone said the coolest stuff. 
I felt
so wonderful.  Then we stood on one side of the room, and half of us
crossed
our hands over our chest, and the other half, came and did some kind of
gesture to everyone that was important to them.  Then the other half of
the
room repeated.  It was so wonderful.  This was just my first rally, but
everyone was just so great, I got and gave about a hundred hugs, and a
few of
us were pretty close to tears *me included* It was so great, and what a
wonderful worship it was!  We all stayed around for a while, smiling and
giving hugs, but eventually once again we went dowstairs to sit and chat
again.  

<p>        It was pretty early since the worship started ahead of schedule (a
first),
but since they had to wait for the last candle to burn out, when it
did, we
started the talent show.  Misty came up and snuggled my leg which made
me feel
all happy because she hadn't been nice to me all weekend!  But the
talent show
was exceptional.  

<p>        Sean burped Blackbird which was about the funniest thing I had ever
seen or
heard, ask him to do it sometime, it had me rolling.  Then Shira 
and
Adam Lock did a striptease to CAKE's "shut the fuck up" and flexed their
ensorpently-strong muscles for us.  I have to say, I'm pretty sure
Shira has
Adam beat, but it was still hilarious.  Then Kris Scott, Aaron Ivener,
and
Danny K. sung a few songs and entertained the masses.  We were all
asked to
turn around and look behind us, and before I knew what was happening,
two girls
were backstroking across the wooden floor of Daniel Hall, oh my god, it
was
hilarious!!! Swimming on dry land, a great idea!!!!!    

<p>        After the talent show was over, a few different people sat down in
front of
the sanctuary to play a rousing game of silent football.  It was my
first game
and I had a little trouble getting the hang of it.  But I wasn't the
only one.
Kris Scott passed the sacred football to Danny K, and all of a sudden,
Danny
jumped out of the universe, and was gone.  Then, the evil anti-Danny
appeared
(though I think it might have been jeremy) and since  Mr. Dictator
couldn't
get Danny back, and anti-danny was sent away, we continued the game
without
them everything was getting very confusing, but oh man, was it
hilarious.   

<p>        I was not the only one totally lost.  As I said, I didn't quite catch
on that
fast, and the terms had fun slipping my memory.  I kept on forgetting
what a
"fwap" was called, and called it a "fish" something or other, and got
mulitple
penace points for not knowing what the hell I was talking about.

<p>        Then Austin,  kris, and Keith got in a huge battle over gestures and
things
outside the universe (FRANK) and penace points were given left and
right, and
by that time, I had started to think that everyone else was as lost as
me.
They are all seriously psychotic.  They went back and forth accusing
each
other of this and that forever, and even forgot to charge me with using
the
most hanous [bad spelling] pronoun "he". (YEAH) At this point, I had 4
and a
half penace points, and everyone else was close behind.  But all of a
sudden,
some source from within the universe started making the gravitational
pull
around my head jerk up and down, taking my head with it.  My head
started
bobbin', and before I knew it, I had a penace point (thanks Kris) and I
had
lost the game!!!!! I was tired though, so I didn't mind much. My
punishment
was to sing "one little two little three little indians", which I
didn't know
the ending to, at closing circle (oops, I forgot.)

<p>        After clearing out, I was tired, so I went in the loungin room, and
went to
sleep. Someone woke me up about 30 minutes later, as it was 7:00, and
time to
wake up and clean.  I cleaned fast, and went to lay down in the loungin
room
with Katie and Keith.  We just chilled for about an hour talking and
snoozin'.

<p>        Then it was time for closing circle. I was getting sad at the thought
of
departure of all my new-found friends, but as always, I had to say
goodbye.
After singing the coconut song, the banana song, and some others, the
seniors
formed their circle, and we sang the closing song. It was so sad, and
man, was
I holdin back tears.  The mugbooks were passed out, and I hugged
EVERYONE at
least 3 or 4 times.  MOJO and I did our special handshake, and Jeremy
and I
almost fell down giving each other bear hugs.  It was absolutley the
happiest
and saddest I had been in a long time, especially all at the same time.
 I
turned around hug after hug, and soon, everyone had gone, and there was
noone
to hug, so I went and curled up on one of the couches in the high
school room,
closed my eyes, and went to sleep.
