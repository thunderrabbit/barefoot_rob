                        <p><title>pictures of the tree that fell</title></p>

<p class=date>Thursday 22 October 1998</p>

<p>Today was a beautiful day and I got into a picture taking, picture
scanning mood.  I walked barefoot from my house to Walgreen's and
bought a little disposable camera, then back past my house and took
pictures where Montrose crosses Allen Parkway. I haven't finished the
roll yet, but soon, oh so soon, I shall scan those pics and give you a
before/after (wet/dry) comparison from the day it flooded.

<p>However, I did scan some other pictures!  From when the <a
href="/cgi-local/journal.pl?date=1998/08#tree_fell">tree fell</a> in my parking lot. I had
accidentally scanned some thumbnails and now I shall use those
in this journal entry to reference the big pics I scanned today.

<p>(I didn't make sure I scanned the exact same photos, but I think I
pretty much did that anyway.  Let's see how it goes.  Click on the
images to get the big version)

<p><table border="0" width="60%" align="center"> <tr><td><a
href="/images/apt3/tree_fell/arrival.jpg"><img
src="/images/apt3/tree_fell/thumbs/arrival2.jpg" align="left"
border="0"></a> Okay, when I arrived, this is pretty much what I saw,
except I arrived at 11pm, and after calling my landlord and him
calling the light company, and them calling the tree crew, these guys
showed up at 5am.  </td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="/images/apt3/tree_fell/my_window.jpg"><img src="/images/apt3/tree_fell/thumbs/room_window3.jpg" align="left" border="0"></a>
From the top of the stairs, this is a view of my room window. I didn't think to take a pic from inside that window...
</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="/images/apt3/tree_fell/staircase.jpg"><img src="/images/apt3/tree_fell/thumbs/top_stairs1.jpg" align="left" border="0"></a>
This view is looking down the stairs.  I made rainforest howling monkey noises as I climbed up them when I first got home.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="/images/apt3/tree_fell/on_a_limb.jpg"><img src="/images/apt3/tree_fell/thumbs/on_a_limb.jpg" align="left" border="0"></a>
After some initial trimming with the long pole things, this guy got up in the tree with a chainsaw.  Not too long after he started some of the neighbors asked incredulously if the work has to be done "now???"  
</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="/images/apt3/tree_fell/on_a_shorter_limb.jpg"><img src="/images/apt3/tree_fell/thumbs/on_a_shorter_limb.jpg" align="left" border="0"></a>
As the branch pieces fell, some hit the phone wires below them; my phone was out of service for about 36 hours after the entertainment
</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="/images/apt3/tree_fell/wires.jpg"><img src="/images/apt3/tree_fell/thumbs/wires.jpg" align="left" border="0"></a>
The smaller portion of the trunk was leaning against the telephone wires, which I believe is what kept it from falling all the way over.
<br>However, the tree was improperly trimmed because of those same wires; so they kinda helped it fall in the first place.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="/images/apt3/tree_fell/clipping.jpg"><img src="/images/apt3/tree_fell/thumbs/pole.jpg" align="left" border="0"></a>
Here's the guy gently clipping small branches out of the wires before cutting the larger branch at its base.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="/images/apt3/tree_fell/hanging.jpg">I didn't scan a thumnail of this one.</a>
<br>I was nervous when he lashed himself to the phone wire to get a better reach way up into the branches.
</td></tr>


<tr><td>These next two shots are different from the larger images, but show the same idea. The thumbnails are the top portion of the branch, and the bigger images are the bigger lower portion of the same branch.</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="/images/apt3/tree_fell/branch_up.jpg"><img src="/images/apt3/tree_fell/thumbs/branch_up.jpg" align="left" border="0"></a>
Once it was trimmed, the branch was similarly lashed to the telephone wire.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="/images/apt3/tree_fell/branch_down.jpg"><img src="/images/apt3/tree_fell/thumbs/branch_down.jpg" align="left" border="0"></a>
The carefully placed knots worked perfectly to lower the branch to the ground.  I was impressed.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="/images/apt3/tree_fell/branches.jpg"><img src="/images/apt3/tree_fell/thumbs/limbs.jpg" align="left" border="0"></a>
From the top of the stairs, I could barely see the parking lot. When the guys left, they left all the branches and the trunk and everything except their stuff.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="/images/apt3/tree_fell/trunk.jpg"><img src="/images/apt3/tree_fell/thumbs/trunk.jpg" align="left" border="0"></a>
At this moment I really began to recognize how different the landscaping would be.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="/images/apt3/tree_fell/feet.jpg"><img src="/images/apt3/tree_fell/thumbs/two_feet.jpg" align="left" border="0"></a>
The trunk was about 2 feet tall.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="/images/apt3/tree_fell/wall.jpg"><img src="/images/apt3/tree_fell/thumbs/no_limb.jpg" align="left" border="0"></a>
The big pic is after these limbs were cleaned up.  It was well into the afternoon, so the lighting is quite different.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="/images/apt3/tree_fell/scott.jpg"><img
src="/images/apt3/tree_fell/thumbs/scottie.jpg" align="left"
border="0"></a> This is my car, Scott, taken from the top of the
stairs.
</table>

<p>Just as I was finishing this entry, my cat Spot hopped up onto my
computer desk and I snapped a few pics of him in the same roll as the
previously mentioned photos of Montrose and Allen Parkway.

<p>I'll be sure to scan a pic of Spot when these come back.</p>

<br>Hey, <br>
Could you get me the names of that tree company that had the guy strapped to the phone line?  That&rsquo;s a major no no in the tree care industry.<br>
<br>
Peace<br>
