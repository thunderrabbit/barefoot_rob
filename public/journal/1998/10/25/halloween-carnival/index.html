                        <p><title>Halloween Carnival</title></p>

<p class=date>25 October 1998</p>

<p>Today at church we had our annual carnival with proceeds benefitting UNICEF.  The youth group had two tables set up: one for face painting and stuff, and the other for fake blood and bandages.

<p>They also were in charge of the jail; people could pay to have others arrested, and those who were arrested could pay to get out.

<p>At one point I was arrested "for being bald" and I walked calmly over to the jail then scampered off, with some of the youth after me. They can't arrest me!!!

<p>I ran out of the area, and jumped the chain link fence around the playground (what a good example I'm setting!) and ran around the entire church with 3 youth behind me.  My ankle was a bit sore (I hurt it last night jumping over Maggie's couch) so I couldn't run super long.

<p>So I climbed up and into the big paper recycling dumpster. I had always wanted to do that! They were right behind me and were soon at the dumpster and David and Katherine climbed in before I thought, "hmmmm, we probably shouldn't play in the paper recycling dumpster," so I calmly got out and let them lead me to the jail.

<p>Once in jail, I squirmed out a little little hole (like just over 18 inches in diameter) and they thought that was entertaining enough to let me go.  Heh.

<p>I got a picture of myself with a crazy black wig on, but I don't like it much.  You won't like it: <a href="/images/rob/ugly_black_wig.jpg">bleh</a>.

<p>I think I'll go to Walgreen's and pick up the roll of pics I mentioned in a recent entry!</p>
