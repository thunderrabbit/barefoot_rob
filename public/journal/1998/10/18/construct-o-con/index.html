<p class=date>Sunday 18 October 1998</p>

<p>What a wild weekend! To give you a visual of sorts, let me say that on Friday, I shaved my head. I shaved it again Saturday morning and again this afternoon.

<p>The bulk of this weekend I spent at First UU Church of Houston with youth for Construct-O-Con, where Houston area youth gathered to design a much larger conference that will be held at my church in January.

<p>Friday afternoon before the thing, Jason Fricke called and was all, "yo, you wanna go skating?"  Yes.

<p>So he arrived at my house like around 3pm and we drove over to Hermann Park area to skate. Quite a duo we must have looked..  He was on skateboard, with shorts and white tanktop and no pads at all. I was on inline skates, fully padded, with fat knee pads, wrist guards and helmet.

<p>We mostly skated around a few steps and a couple of ramps (not designed for skating, but part of the Miller Outdoor Theater). It was just a beatiful fall day and we just experienced our own playfulness. We hardly interacted more than, "oh cool did you see that?" or "watch this..." before trying a new skill.

<p>We expanded our boundaries and I skated, jumping from bench to bench, along a sidewalk toward the Houston Zoo. By the duck lake we waved HI to the few people riding the little train around the park..  (You know, I've never ridden that train...)

<p>Oh crap.. as I'm typing I just realized I'm not writing a skating adventure; I'm writing about the whole weekend lock-in!

<p>Okay, I got a call from Christina on my cell phone and she asked for our help with the food. We had just been en route to The Medical Center (to play around more steps and stuff) when she called.  We got back to the car and I got my skates and pads off just as it started to rain.  Perfect timing!

<p>To Christina's work we picked up a big pile of food, including a tub of sugar cookie dough. Jason and I taste tested it a few times to make sure it was good.  It was good.  Yup, still good.  We were laffin', squirting dough between our teeth and having a great time!

<a name="buttsup">
<p>Then zipped to the church, dropped off the food, then to my house and got cleaned up. (We each played pinball on my computer while the other showered) To the church we arrived fashionably late and the whole group played wall ball most of the night.
"Wall ball" is essentially the same game that I played in high school called "butts up."  (*)

<p>As a group we joined the CUUPS (something UU Pagan Society) group for their worship. It focused on Samhain, "that time of the year when the veil between the physical world and the after world is the thinnest" and we all were given the opportunity to talk about people we know who have died. The sharing was a bit heavier than I expected, and though I personally felt fine afterward, some of the youth had cried about some of the deaths.. so I thought a "decompression session" would be appropriate after the worship.

<p>So we talked a bit (without the CUUPS) in our own group where I hoped the youth would feel safer to get out anything they needed to. I encouraged a couple who needed it to experience their sadness or anger or whatever, but to certainly not bottle up those emotions!

<p>I think it went well.

<p>I was up until about 3 that night; I didn't watch whatever movie they watched until 5am.

<p>Woke up, zipped home to get my cell phone charger, and used the opporunity to shower and again. I used that opportunity to shave my head again; my hair felt like sandpaper after almost 24 hours of growth.

<p>Wall ball wall ball wall ball until lunch then more more more until other youth arrived and then at about 5pm we started our rally planning.

<p>There were several new youth who had never been to a rally, so I gave an overview of them and had the experienced youth give their versions.  Then we figured out who would organize what for our rally in January.

<p>The theme will be "Fricke's Fiesta Con Queso" (for any of you YRUUers out there, this is your sneak preview) and the whole thing will be centered around Salsa, queso, and anything spanish we can think of.  We'll even look into getting sponsorship from Taco Cabana.

<p>Two hours later we had the whole overview complete, with various youth volunteers to be in charge of the various aspects, and me as overview coordinator type person. kT took notes.

<p><hr align="center" width="25%">

<p>Then some real interesting dynamics occurred when the group doubled in size on Saturday evening.  Seems that some youth had heard the lock-in was only for Saturday night.  Hmmmm.

<p>We had one more meeting planned, and wow. There was a pretty big rift between the two groups. I think it was overall handled poorly; not *all* the youth had to be at the meeting, and they certainly didn't want to be there. I have certainly learned from the experience.

<p>Then it was play wall ball, play loud music, and play movies night until 3 or 4 am.  I went to bed at about 1 and got major good sleep until I woke up at 6 from a weird dream set in Austin.

<p><blockquote><em>
We were at Austin First Church and I was wearing my Lyle Luau "Near .. Far" Grover shirt. We were in a long line to say HI to some famous DJ type guy wearing shades outside in the parking lot. He was near a fence. Somehow I was whisked forward in line; I didn't have to wait behind everyone, and he talked with me more than with anyone else. We play-danced some funny playfully overtly sexual dance move and I woke up.
</em></blockquote>

<p>I got up and surveyed the church to find everyone asleep, zonked out strewn across the floor basically in 3 rooms, mostly in the movie watching room.

<p>No one had cooked the cookie dough, so I made sure it hadn't gone bad. It hadn't, so I ate a bit more.

<p>The place was mostly clean, amazingly enough, so cleanup was not too difficult at 8am when I woke everyone up. I mostly coordinated the cleanup efforts and when it was all good, we had cereal and said our goodbyes.

<p>To church our group went by way of IHOP, where I noticed the picture of "IHOP" written in syrup on the front of the menu looks like "dOH!" upsided down. Pretty cool; try it.

<p>I was pretty doze-y during church then went home, shaved my head and slept.</p>
