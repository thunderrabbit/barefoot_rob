<p class=date>16-18 January 1998</p>
<p>

After a few weeks of receiving registrations via mail and phone and
fax and email, we had 111 youth registrations and 22 adult
registrations.  I received 7 registrations on the Friday the rally
began.  Holy cow what a huge rally!
<p>
Friday morning I picked up the T-shirts bearing our controversial
"Imagine the Cat in the Hat Burning the Flag" title and image of a
seedy looking cat holding a lighter.  In the background is an American
flag except the stars are replaced by a large question mark.  I had
ordered and picked up 130 shirts.
<p>
Friday day Denise and I spent $520 buying a lot of food.
<p>
Friday night the people started pouring in.  Everything stayed calm
and stable, but just slowly wound up and up as more people arrived.
At 1am we had a rally virgin opening circle and it went a little long
as I couldn't think of what I wanted to say.  I think we got it all
covered and it was all good.
<p>
Opening circle for the whole rally was at 2am, and I tossed Jon W-L
out in the middle of the circle and said, "go for it," assuming he
knew what to say.  So opening circle was a bit shaky, but still fun
and funny.  At one point, Arlene D was hollering something about
something while we were trying to define the No Sex rule.  I hollered
over toward her from my <em><b>Pulp Fiction</b></em> favorite quote list, "tell that
bitch to chill! .. Tell her 'chill, bitch, chill!' ... Yolanda!
Yolanda!  What's Fonzie like?  Dassright!  he's coool.  and that's
what we're going to be.  we gonna be cooool."  Kim S is the only
person I saw who noticed and knew what it was from.
<p>
After opening circle, double chaos began as I let everyone go at the
same time to their touch groups, and no one knew who was in their
touch group and it was nuts.  The rally had begun like crap and I was
feeling a bit responsible.
(let this be a lesson if you're designing a rally: give everyone a
bead or something that tells what group they're in, *or* send each
group out one at a time by calling each individual's name.)
<p>
After helping people get to their touch groups, I finally made it to
mine and helped Anna M out a bit and we had a great touch group.
<p>
I stayed up talking with people and stuff until like 4:30am.
<p>
My internal rally-clock woke me up excited after sleeping 3.5 hours; I
went to wake up Charlotte, the touch group leader in charge of making
breakfast.  I found her in the kitchen with her touchgroup and
breakfast was practically made!!!  Yay!!  All the anxiety I felt about
the chaotic start of the rally flittered away like happy butterflies.
<p>
I bounced around talking to others who had woken up and many who had not
slept yet.
<p>
Later I was talking to a few advisors outside.  We had been talking
about emotions and the meaning of life when Charlie G had just brought
up the book _Conversations with God_ by Neale Walsch. I told him I
hadn't read it, but was interested.  He commented that bringing up
that book makes people leave the conversation because no one wants to
talk about it.  "Hmmm," I thought.
<p>
Soon Daniel or someone ran up and was all, "Rob!  We're playing
Ultimate over in the parking lot!"<br>
Cool. As I left to play, Charlie was all, "see- it clears the table
because no one wants to talk about it."<br>
My brain jerked back, "what?" Holy moly..  He had just said bringing
up the book would clear the table, I promptly disbelieved that and
forgot about it and left the table.  Wow!
<p>
During Ultimate, we had great fun, even playing while the disc had a
big crack in it.  We even played two short spontaneous games after the
disk was broken, claiming the bigger section was worth three-quarters
of a point, and I was part of the group playing for one-quarter of a
point.
<p>
At 2:30 or so, our theme speaker, Warren Apel from Arizona, talked
about First Amendment rights, including but not condoning flag
desecration.  The workshop was well attended, and quite informative.
I slept through about 1/2 of it.
<p>
I was in YAC meetings for much of the afternoon.  We selected the
youth staff for this coming SWUUSI.  I don't remember everyone who was
selected, but I do remember that Maia C and Ashley R are the co-deans,
Nathan R is the worship coordinator, Jen C is the mugbook editor, Nick
C is the special events coordinator, Adam L is the spirit leader, and
that's all I remember.  Congratulations to all who were selected!!
<p>
Soon we needed to have a YRUU meeting to vote for YAC positions. All
the YAC candidates presented their ad-lib speeches and everyone needed
to vote.
<p>
I had a bit of a logistics problem:<br>
<ul>
<li>We needed all the youth to vote for 3 YAC positions.</li>
<li>People in the kitchen had just gotten vegetarian food ready (after I
totally screwed up and didn't have any for the main dinnertime).
</li>
<li>The special event was ready to go.</li>
</ul>
<p>
I felt greatly pleased with how the transition turned out.  I
announced, "okay!  That's all the YAC candidates!  Now you get to vote
on your favorite 3.  And after you vote, you can eat vegetarian in the
kitchen!"  Everything went smoothly, everyone got to eat, and the
special event was inflated.  Yay!!!!
<p>
From the general youth perspective, I believe the best part of the
rally was our special event.  Jason Fricke's idea was to rent a
"Bouncy Boxing" thing.  It's one of those air-filled "moonwalk" deals
except the participants wear enormous soft boxing gloves and bounce
around and wail on one another.
<p>
To see the folded red canvas in the middle of the room slowly swell
into a fully huge bouncy boxing ring was incredible.  We had not told
anyone what was growing to be the special event.  I loved it.
I never challenged anyone to boxing, but I jumped and jumped about 5
different times with various people.  It was the most fun I've had in
a long while.
<p>
The Bouncy Boxing was there from like 9:15 till just after midnight,
when everyone was asked to gather for the worship.  The youth had
designed another wonderful experience, building the spiritual
community to new levels of wonderfulness.
<p>
About an hour later, we gently sang our way back to the main hall for
random mingling and then the talent show!
<p>
Kristian S did a hilarious parody of Marilyn Manson's "Sweet Dreams"<br>
Sean and Steve performed one of their old rally classics, plus "Dead
Puppies" (another rally classic) and Sean sang "If I Ever Fall in
Love" a capella.<br>
Some youth recited their own emotionally harsh poetry and Mary S
dramatized a suicide to Tori Amos' song "Marianne."<br>
I performed "cool and creamy" with Jen C, singing and resulting in
whipped cream all over one another.  You should have been there!<br>  As
we cleaned that up, Aaron I and Kristian S performed Madonna's "Like a
Prayer" and some others.<br>
I got to drum for Mike N rapping, *and* Jen C & Dane D did part III of
San Antonio Saki, with Kristian S and I lip synching their words and
other sound effects.  Very funny... especially Kris.<br>
Then Shira (I think) performed her most annoying sound and the show
kinda fizzled from there.
<p>
Then we had a SWUUSI 1997 dance relapse with the wacky Seasame Street
song (I still don't know who performs that) twice!!!!  What an
incredible energy drain is that song!
Then Korn (I don't know what song) was played several times and I stayed
up cleaning with some youth for about 1.5 hours.
I greatly appreciate their help.
<p>
I slept from 4:30am to 6:00am.  
<p>
We groggily got up at 6 to clean clean clean and amazingly, by 8am, the
place was perfect. 
Closing circle out in the parking lot and I was deeply emotionally
touched when I hugged Charlie G and he gave me a beautiful hardback copy
of <em>Conversations With God</em>.   
<p>
What a perfect touch to a perfect weekend!</p>
