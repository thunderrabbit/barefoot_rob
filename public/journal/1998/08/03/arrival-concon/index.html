                        <p><title>Con Con arrival</title></p>

<p class=date>11pm Monday 3 August 1998</p>

<p><br><font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font></p>

<p>Arrived at the airport from Phoenix after 1 hour flight during which I slept most of the way. I woke at the end to see Ian F (I like the pun "E 'n F") who I met at GA and his sister Kathleen.

<p>Bryan Beck said HI while we were waiting for baggage and then we sat with the pile of youth after collecting Ian and Kathleen's stuff.

<p>I rode on the second bus and met and remet youth: Lucian, Zara, Laura, Laura, Jenny, Chelsea, Chris, Duncan, Brendan, Jeff.. we pretty much only had one person per seat so that was cool.

<p>On the way up the mountain we had to stop once to let the bus cool off and I took a picture that included two road signs: 

<p><pre>ICY</pre>

<p>and

<p><pre>
ROCK
SLIDE
AREA
</pre>

<p>As we pulled into the campground, I was <em>amazed</em> at how small of a road the bus driver drove through.  wow!  <em>CRUNCH</em> as we turned a corner and hit the side of something <em>CRACK</em> as a 2 inch tree branch wacked the side of the bus..

<p>We all stepped off the bus amidst huge applause from those who had already arrived. I got hugs from Southwest District Youth Bryan Beck, Melissa Cain, Maia Cudhea, Jeremy Loomis-Norris, Nathan Ryan, and Emily Stainer (we have a YAC quorum!) and got my picture taken and my nametag made and my secret buddy bag made and talked and talked.  Had dinner with Zara, Cat, Ian, Fannie, Chris, and Arnie (who spelled his name R-Knee) and taught them all the cup game.

<p>At advisor meeting, Bobby handed out trinkets and then we had the main ConCon welcome meeting during which I fell asleep.

<p>Touchgroup meetings at 11pm.  Mine met at Cabin 7: Mara, Kaity, Kathryn, Jenny, Zach, Jeremy, Lucian, and Mimi. We talked and then exchanged favorite music tastes and I got some cool ideas for ambient and stuff.  I'm tired and am going to bed.
