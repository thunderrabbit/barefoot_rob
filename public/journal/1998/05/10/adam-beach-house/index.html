<p><p>This Sunday at church was the 8th graders&rsquo; Affirmation Sunday, honoring their place in the church and welcoming them into the high school program.</p>

<p><p>We had a slightly different preparation process this year; the youth paired up with adult mentors who worked with them in various fields of growth, from creating a personal view of God and religion, to doing some service work for the community.</p>

<p><p>The youths&rsquo; speeches were beautiful; I could hear sniffling noses in the audience behind me and my sniffling nose.</p>

<p><p>After the sniffling, we had pizza!  Yay!  Pizza for all and then even better, a trip to the Woods&rsquo; beach house down on the beach.</p>

<p><p>We piled into 3 vehicles and cruised down there, talking, laughing and playing silly mind games with one another.  (&ldquo;Ceiling Wall Floor&rdquo; and &ldquo;Name That Famous Person&rdquo; were the most played)  Oh, we also sang, &ldquo;I know a song that gets on everybody&rsquo;s nerves&rdquo; and &ldquo;This is the song that never ends&rdquo; to pass several minutes..</p>

<p><p>Dang. Now the song is cycling through my brain.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ll be right back.</p>

<p><p><hr></p>

<p><p>19 May 1998</p>

<p><p>Their beach house is pretty cool.  It&rsquo;s dome shaped, and is made up of like 50-some-odd wooden triangles.  There is an upstairs and downstairs and living room and kitchen and 2 bedrooms.</p>

<p><p>We chilled for a bit and after all the youth ran out to go swimming, a wandered out there and began to bury my feet in the sand.</p>

<p><p>Each time I go to the beach, I dig some kind of hole, usually until the water come sloshing over it from the surf, or bubbling up from the bottom.. in either case, flattening the hole into a gentle puddle on the beach.</p>

<p><p>This day I simply stood and dug a hole with each foot, burrowing slowly down into the sand.  After not too long, I had them buried up to my ankles.</p>

<p><p>I chilled for a bit like this, closed my eyes and felt the wind and sun. (I was smart enough to wear long sleeved shirt and pants, some great sunscreen!)</p>

<p><p>This didn&rsquo;t feel deep enough.  So I wrenched my feet out and dug deeper, fully covering my ankle bones and everything.  That was fun for a bit. I tried to jump, which stretched my back in a weird way that made me remember why I didn&rsquo;t like to jump while my feet are buried in sand.</p>

<p><p>How much deeper could I go?  I still had not used my hands to bury my feet, so I let my hands help with the holes this time. While I was digging, a particularly ambitious wave reached my excavation site, beginning the puddle formation.  This just helped me dig deeper so I did.</p>

<p><p>Finally I had my feet buried fully 1 foot deep.</p>

<p><p>I closed my eyes and meditated like a tree. Just experiencing the beach and nature around me. I decided I would not open them until someone came up to me, or until the surf reached me 3 times.</p>

<p><p>I peeked when I heard Wende&rsquo;s voice off in the distance.  Oops. I closed my eyes again, aware that she was approaching.
I didn&rsquo;t expect a gentle kiss on the lips from her.  Mmmm.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;HI&rdquo; we both said.</p>

<p><p>She was as tall as I, or something; she seemed to appreciate the extra foot the sand gave her.  The weird thing for me was that as I scanned the horizon, everything looked fine.  Then as I looked at the ground closer and closer to me&hellip;  Yeowzers! I&rsquo;m suddenly short!</p>

<p><p>I was probably out in that spot for a bit over an hour.</p>

<p><p>The youth had come by twice, and were playing out in the raft when I decided I had been a tree long enough. My feet tingled after I pulled them out of the sand; my hypothesis is the sand smooshed the blood out of them, so they kinda went to sleep.</p>

<p><p>The raft was fun; I helped them pull it out toward the breakers and against the prevailing tide, and once we were a ways out, let the waves whhhhhaaassshhh us back toward shore, sometimes tumbling one or two youth out of the raft.</p>

<p><p>A wonderful fun time was had by all.</p>

<p><p>We were soon called in for dinner, hotdogs, and meat or vegetarian burgers. I had a veggie burger and sat by Anna, giggling with her about rally stories and a joke.</p>

<p><p>I told the joke to the group.. it&rsquo;s my favorite entirely clean joke lately. Maybe I&rsquo;ll put it in here. Probably not.</p>

<p><p>Anna and I enjoyed it more than the rest of the group, and I&rsquo;m glad about that.</p>

<p><p>Pretty much after that we packed it up and went home. On the way back I rode with Wende, who had driven up separately because she had to go to work for a bit.</p>

<p><p>I don&rsquo;t remember what we talked about.</p>

<p><p></p>
