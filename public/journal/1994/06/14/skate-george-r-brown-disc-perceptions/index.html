                        <p class=date>14 June 1994<p>

<p>About a week ago was my latest crazy skating adventure.
<br>My goal for the night was to skate down the 18-wheeler access ramps at
the George R. Brown Convention Center on the edge of downtown.  At
Party on the Plaza, I talked to a guy named Matt, I think, told him my
goal, and he and I skated over there. The access ramps are about 3
stories tall and pretty darn long.  They actually span a city block
away from the building on each side. Before we went up, we planned our
exit route that we would take as we finished the ramp.  There was a
bit of street construction there, so we said "okay we'll skate
between these two barrels and if there is no car, we can skate out
into the street, otherwise we need to jump over this piece of wood
blah blah.." We got that planned, so we skated up one of them, and got
scared 3 times as 3 cars came down and each time I *knew* it was a
police car and we were busted. Fortunately, I was wrong.       We got
to the top and looked over the edge.  When we would spit over the
edge, it took like 4 or 5 seconds to splat on the ground.  We were way
up there.   "Ready?"   "Let's go."  I went first.  I got going pretty
fast, got to the bottom of the ramp, skated between the barrels, out
into the street because there was no traffic, coasted 2 blocks and
that was it.  That was it??  I wanted *speed*, white knuckle blinding
*speed* that would rocket us across the city.  It just didn't happen
When I go next time, I'll push myself so I get more speed than just
gravity pulling me down.</p>

<p>I found a group that plays disc in a bank drive-through area, so I
joined them for a while.  ("Disc" is the word we use for the game that
normal people call "frisbee."    Frisbee is actually a brand name.) So
this drive through is like really really smooth concrete, and well
lit, so we have big fun there.  I was unable to play as much as I
wanted; I felt really tired the whole time, like I was doing a lot of
work, but just not going anywhere.  I made a few cool catches, though:
a through-the-legs catch and one big leaping catch that almost made me
eat concrete. After playing disc, I saw two women I talked to when I
went jousting and they were with 3 other people. They were about to go
skate some parking garages, so I joined them. We got to one and found
that the building had just recently installed garage door style gates
that would not permit us to skate in like we usually do- just skate
under the little parking garage arm thing. So that effectively kept us
out.  So we decided to skate to Jesus Saves and see what we would find
there.   Across the street from Jesus Saves is the Allen Center
parking garage, so we skated that first.</p>

<p>Allen Center is either the first or second garage I ever skated.  I
remember it was a towering, menacing, *steep*, Garage of Terror, with
deadly posts and speed bumps everywhere.   Apparently, the owners of
the garage decided to make it nice for skaters.  The garage was not
nearly as steep, the speed bumps were much shorter, and there was much
more room between the posts.  I also noted that it was only like 4
stories tall.  It used to be 10 or 20.   As we skated out of the
garage, there was a security guard right at the bottom.  I stopped and
he said "you shouldn't be in here..skate on out of here." So we left
and went across the street to Jesus Saves. Jesus Saves is the name of
the most tremendous parking lot in dowtown Houston. (Note: the
following sentence is not a skewed perception of a beginning skater)
Jesus Saves is 13 stories tall, and each ramp goes down two stories at
a time. (The rest of the description is skewed by my opinions)  When
you skate down this sucker, you get going really *really* fast.  I
can't imagine being able to skate down it without either 1) braking on
the way down each ramp, or 2) dumping speed between each ramp by
skating on the level surface of the parking area. I chose the brake on
the way down method, and tested to see just how *little* I could brake
and still make the turn to the next ramp. Only once did I end up going
too fast and missing the turn, forcing me to dump some speed where the
cars park.  I did not hit any cars, and, as opposed to the first time
I skate Jesus Saves, I did not wreck at all on the way down.   When we
got to the bottom, I was sitting on a little wall and I felt my
wheels.   I like the fact that they get warm after flying down a
garge.  To my surprise, I found that one wheel was *hot*.   Like
"yeow!  That's hot!" hot.  It turns out that the wheel was rubbing
against part of the skate and actually melted the plastic there.  As
the plastic melted, it deformed and rubbed harder against the wheel
and removed the wheel from the axle toward the outer edge. It was
pretty wild.  That explained why I felt like I couldn't skate anywhere
when we were playing disc.</p>

<p><p>Yesterday, I went to the Montrose Skate Shop and showed him my wheel.
He was pretty impressed and scraped off the melted plastic part of the
skate.  Not even counting that one wheel, my wheels were really shot.
He said that he had just thrown away 5 sets of wheels from rental
skates that were in much better condition.  So he gave me a set of
wheels that were practically new compared to mine.   I put them on and
they work wonderfully.<p></p>
