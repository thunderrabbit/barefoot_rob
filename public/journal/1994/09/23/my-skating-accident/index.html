                        <p class=date>23 September 1994<p>

<p>Well, as you may have heard, my latest Amazing Skating Adventure
wasn't as wonderful as some of the others I've had.  On Thursday (the
15th) I went downtown to Jone's Plaza area and found my friends
watching some skaters jump 2 different ramps while *hundreds* of other
skaters watched.</p>

<p>Wow.  One of the ramps had 3 boxes stacked behind it- I'm guessing
about 9 feet high.  Eric, who built that particular ramp, was jumping
the boxes consistently, smoothly, beautifuly, capturing the attention
of all the hundreds of skaters.  It was amazing.  He'd come whizzing
down the sidewalk [zziiing], shoot up the ramp [shoop], tuck and sail
above the boxes [air], then land flawlessly beyond them [smooth].

<br>I was entirely impressed.
<br>[zziiing] [shoop]  [air] [smooth]
<br>I was really entirely impressed.  I watched how perfectly easily he did it.
<br>[zziiing] [shoop] [air] [smooth]
<br>"MAN, I wish I could do that!!"  I was excited.
<br>[zziiing] [shoop] [air] [smooth] (perfect.)
<br>"I bet I could do that!!"
<br>[zziiing] [shoop] [air] [smooth]
<br>(someone took a picture of him tucked in midair.)
<br>"I *know* I can do that!!"</p>

<p>I was going to jump.  Eric was stopped near me.  He was *right*
*there* and I almost asked him for his helmet.  He was talking to
someone; I didn't want to interrupt.  "Aw fuckit" I thought.  "What
could happen?"</p>

<p>I skated up the sidewalk so that I could get some speed down toward the ramp.
The boxes had just gotten knocked over by someone.  I remember waiting for
them to get stacked back up again.
<br>That is all I remember.</p>

<p>Apparently, I came hauling ass down toward the ramp, hoping that
speed would make up for lack of skill and finesse.  It didn't.  I hit
the ramp and went up.  Way up.  My feet went higher.  I *almost*
cleared all the boxes.  I hit the top of the top box and then fell,
nearly head first, and landed splat on my upper back and shoulders,
and cracked my head on the sidewalk.
<br>Bad bad bad bad bad.</p>

<p>I sat up... and clunked right back down again, cracking skull
against concrete.  My body began to spasm as I curled into fetal
position.  My friend Scott passed out.  I'm sure a lot of people
wanted to pass out: everyone thought I was dead.  A few people
approached me, searching for a pulse, but to no avail.  (Kudos to
Randy who held my head to keep me from smashing it on the ground as I
shook.  I don't know who the other people were who helped, but I thank
them.)</p>

<p>There was blood.  A lot of it.  It apparently squirted out my right
ear just like in the movies but worse.  Fortunately, since the place
was so packed, an ambulance was close at hand and I was ace number one
priority in the ER.</p>

<p>Eight or twelve hours later I began to vaguely realize through
cloudy brain waves that I was in a hospital.  My entire existance was
pure pain.  While slipping slowly in and out of consicousness for
hours or minutes I don't know which but I hurt and I had to vomit.  So
I did.  God, it hurt.</p>

<p>I remember ripping the IV tube out of my arm because I hurt.  I was
in no shape to argue when the nurse put it back.  NG tubes suck.
Catheters suck worse.</p>

<p>I was pretty messed up.  Lots of friends and my immediate family
came to see me; I just hurt, suffering through consciousness.  It was
not until 36 hours later that I could actually recognize my friends
and family.  I had been moved out of intensive care and into a ward
room.</p>

<p>I wanted out of the hospital.  By Monday afternoon, I was able to
shuffle (with a person on each arm) my way around the nurses' station,
a whole 100 feet or so.  I begged for them to let me out.  They did.
<br>My back hurt like hell and if I moved, it hurt worse.  
<br>I had a monster headache for over a week.  My right ear was
ringing for six weeks.  My back hurt for nine months.  My sense of
smell is still not entirely back.  
<br>I had fractured my skull, fractured my TMJ, received a double
concussion, and chipped one of my vertebra.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I didn't skate for ten months.  I will be the first to tell you
that I am lucky to be alive, much less walking, much much less
skating.</p>

<p><p>Wear a helmet, and be careful when you skate.<p></p>
