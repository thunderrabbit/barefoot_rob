                        <p class=date>Friday 1 July 1994<p>

<p>Skating last night started out lame, but ended with wild new
adventures for me.  I hung out at Party on the Plaza with Karen who
only remembered me after I reminded her that she was the first person
I talked to after I sliced my thumb and smeared blood all over my NO
FEAR T-shirt.  I was wearing the shirt last night, as I always like to
when I skate.</p>

<p>From the Plaza, I joined a group skating to Fuzzy's, a bar that
has lots of police department type stuff- badges, lights, pictures,
and even a banged up HPD vehicle door.  No one was doing anything 
there, so I joined a group that was skating to a bar called Heads Up.
The name of the bar was unfamiliar to me until I remembered that it
is right in the middle of the gay bar part of Houston, near where I 
live.  Dude- I was kinda wary of going in there, but with all of us
together, I felt better.  There was probably about 20 of us clompering
up the steps into the bar.  There were about 4 or 5 people already in 
the bar, so safety in numbers really worked for me.  We hung out and
I talked to Susanah, who it turns out that I met her on 4th of July
last year, which was the first day she had ever skated.  That was
kinda cool.  While we were there, someone sang over the intercom,</p>

<pre>
 I hate you
 you hate me
 I shot Barney in the knee
 with a thump he fell to the floor
 no more purple dinosaur.
</pre>

<p>We cheered.  About 15 minutes later, someone shouted, "Let's Skate!!"
Within 1 minute the bar was empty except for the original 4 or 5 
people still there.</p>

<p>I skated with a group of 6 people back downtown to Fuzzy's.  Ed,
who is *really* good on skates was there, and he had skinned his
elbow.  He said that he was trying to do 180s (180 degree turns in the
air) over a box they had set up by a ramp, and he toasted twice in a
row.  I had him wipe some blood on my shirt.  A ramp at the Plaza, eh?
So we skated to the Plaza and Adam had his new ramp out there and
everyone was jumping it or watching.  One guy could get about 5 feet
of air off the ramp- that was wild.  The ramp was about 1.5 feet high
and 3 feet long.  I scoped out the situation, and didn't feel too
happy about the box being there, so they laid it on its side and I
jumped it that way.  No sweat actually.  I jumped it about 5 or 7
times and only needed my pads once.  I did good pads, so that was
cool.  "Good pads" means one used his/her pads well during a wreck.  A
cool thing was that there was actually a female jumping with us.  I
had not met any women who would do ramps with us.  Her name is Sonja.
Adam put the ramp away and 5 of us bunched together and skated in
search of water.  We went to Brewery Tap and drank two pitchers of
water in about as many minutes.  We cruised to go do some parking
garages.  At this point, we had 9 people in our group.  Roberta
brought a new kind of frisbee called a Woblong, which I had never seen
before.  It throws really weird compared to regular frisbees.  We were
crazy skating down the street chasing after the disc all around cars
and buses trying to drive.  One time, I threw the thing and it veered
left and I chased it up onto the sidewalk and I ended up sitting on
the sidewalk with my back against the building.  Roberta came flying
by along the sidewalk and I scrunched my leg up just in time to get it
out of her way.  We had big fun Woblonging all the way to Allen Center
parking garage.  We rode to the top of the elevator and then clanged
up the stairs to the seventh level, the very roof of the building.
There we had a 150 X 150 foot playing area, nice and smooth, with no
cars and a four foot wall all around the perimeter, except at the ramp
to drive/skate down.</p>

<p>We threw the Woblong around, performing the graceful chaotic dance
that I never can describe except that its pretty much random as we
skate to get the disc while barely avoiding each other..  The pattern
would be quite an interesting one to see from the air.  I learned how
to throw that thing while we were up there.  At one point Matt and I
both committed ourselves to recovering the Woblong where it lay, and
we both knew the other was coming at a right angle, but we both didn't
veer off course.  BLAM!!!  we smashed into each other and bounced all
over the place.  Neither of us snagged the disc.  We got up and
verified that the other was okay, and I shouted to everyone else,
"dude!  Wasn't that cool?  How did that look?" and one guy said, "it
looked like you both ate it."  Heh.  We skated up there for probably
30 minutes and the we chilled by the wall before skating down.  Once
again, I found the garage to be not as wild as the first time I skated
it, so I made it harder by swerving in and out of various obstacles
and such.  At the very bottom is a weird part of the garage that is
almost like a 1/2 pipe built just for us.  We skated it a few times
and I was able to scrunch right up near the very top of it where the
ramp was only 4 feet below the ceiling.  That was cool.
<br>On the way out of the garage, I successfully accepted a
challenge to jump over a chain about two feet high and land on the
ground on the other side about 4 feet below the chain.  The ceiling
above the chain was only about 5 feet higher than the chain.  They all
clapped politely impressed after I did it.</p>

<p>Then we went to George R. Brown Convention Center to do the
18-wheeler access ramps.  This time we skated on the *other* ramp than
the one I did last time.  This ramp does not lead straight into a
street where you barely have to turn to exit, but forces one to make a
tight right turn within the width of the street that it dumps onto,
which is about 4 or 5 lanes wide.  We hiked to the top and the first
time down, I raced one of the guys.  Last time I did the other ramp, I
just coasted down and that was lame.  This time, we both pushed down
pretty much as fast as we could.  As I was about half-way down, I
thought, "no way.  No way I can make it."  So I braked hard and must
have braked while skating 60 feet or so before I got off my brake and
made the turn at the bottom.  He won by about 20 feet.  We coasted 2
blocks and then turned around to skate it again.  The hike to the top
was definitely higher this time.  He didn't want to race, so I went
first and really hauled-ass all the way down.  No braking for me at
all.  I was flying down and had to use the entire width of both the
ramp and the street to make my turning radius as wide as possible.  As
I entered the street, I noted that 4 of the people in our group were
sitting on the curb with skates in the street.  "Oh shit!" I yelled
and cranked my turn harder and <barely made the turn and whizzed past
them.  I had to use my brake to keep from coasting more than 3 blocks
this time.  I was really moving.</p>

<p>We skated back toward the Plaza and our group slowly broke up as we
reached our respective vehicles.  I gave them my phone number, and I
really think we might skate together again sometime.</p>
