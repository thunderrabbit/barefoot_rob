<h2 id="21-12-saturday-25-june-2016-jst">21:12 Saturday 25 June 2016 JST</h2>

<p>So today was the big day! Got to assist Soness at TEDx Waseda as she
assisted all the speakers in the event. I helped Alan by recording
some audience reactions during the presentations.  I couldn&rsquo;t do many
because the camera couldn&rsquo;t discern much of the audience in the dark.
He recorded all the presenters and some audience reactions after the
show.</p>

<p>All the presentations were great!  Well, the ones in Japanese were
hard (near impossible) for me to understand, but the rest were great!
Yuji&rsquo;s was amazing for his first time up on stage.  I&rsquo;d love to give a
presentation that well!</p>

<p>Great to meet Rick (who flew in from LA to speak) and Mitsue, both of
whom I knew from Soness&rsquo;s
<a href="https://soness.teachable.com/courses/ted-worthy-application/">TED Worth Application</a>
course.</p>

<p>Great to see すん, and got to meet his friend はるき as well!  They
both came up from Yokohama, having been invited by Soness.  They&rsquo;re
taking her class on communication skills.  Met
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/bannerline">Steve Marshall</a> after the
show and told him about Tokyo men&rsquo;s group.</p>

<p>Outside, Steve and Mitsue took pictures of Yuji, me, and my bare feet
for Pecha Kucha, and I got caught by the &ldquo;one&rdquo; security guard roaming
the campus on Saturday when I climbed up on a wall overlooking a
staircase.  Aww man it wasn&rsquo;t event at the deep part of the stairs!</p>

<p>We took a bus then subway to Shibuya (we = me, Soness, Yuji, Mitsue,
and Rick) where we ate 回転寿司 (かいてんすし) after visiting
Hachiko.  I chatted with Mitsue during dinner, talking about how I met
Lin and how she met her husband, and the history of flower arrangement
in Japan.  Turns out she is 9 (nine) days older than me.  Wow!!!</p>

<p>She also teaches English in Japan, so I invited her to the TESOL thing
tomorrow; we&rsquo;ll see if she comes!</p>

<p>Okay I just got to my station. bye!</p>
