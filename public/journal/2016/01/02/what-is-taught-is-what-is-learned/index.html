<p>Here&rsquo;s my answer to the statement &ldquo;What is taught is what is learned&rdquo;</p>

<pre><code>What is taught is definitely not what is learned.  Students focus
on whatever they focus on.  The instructor may be talking about
blah blah blah, but the student might be focusing on their navel,
their cellphone, etc.  In this case, what is taught is for naught.
As we learned early in this course, students are busy forming
their opinions about the teacher's ability to teach instead of the
topic itself, and that's just in the first 6 seconds of class.

So imagine the case where the students love the instructor and
hang on his/her every word and nuance.  Even then, each individual
student has their own unique way of perceiving the world.  Through
life experiences, our perceptions are colored/filtered via our
past, which is unique for every person.

Only for infants, starting with a blank slate of experiences, are
their perceptions unfiltered.  But in that case, there's too much
information and not enough context for the infant to know what's
what.

The above examples are all the extremes.  In the optimal
situation, students enjoy the class, enjoy learning, and have just
the right life experiences to focus on exactly what the teacher
hopes to teach.  Assume these students do their best to acquire
the language, working outside the class, in their own time,
possibly in 'real life' situations.  They study and practice and
sooner than later, improve their skills. but that was due to their
practice more than what was taught.
