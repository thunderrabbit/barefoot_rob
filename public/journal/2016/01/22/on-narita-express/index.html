<h2 id="13-35-friday-22-january-2016-jst">13:35 Friday 22 January 2016 JST</h2>

<p>Lin and I are chillin on Narita Express #27, 1700 yen each from 品川
to Narita Airport (成田 ah crap I forgot this word)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve just confirmed my packing and buying list was completed on time!</p>

<h2 id="17-07-jst">17:07  JST</h2>

<p>Late start leaving, but we&rsquo;ve just started boarding, 2 minutes after
departure time.</p>

<p>During the delay, I got an extra ticket done for CB.  yay!</p>

<h2 id="19-33-jst-2-33-los-angeles">19:33 JST / 2:33 Los Angeles</h2>

<p>I feel sad that I got pissy when one of the ground crew(?) informed me
that I &ldquo;must&rdquo; wear shoes to get on the plane.  At first I was like, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t have shoes; I have sandals in my bag&rdquo;</p>

<p>When she walked away, I walked away, done no worries.</p>

<p>Well, she sent a local ground crew guy after me.  He smiled and asked
in English &ldquo;where are your shoes?&rdquo;   and I go &ldquo;where are <em>your</em>
shoes??&rdquo; and he laughed.</p>

<p>She came up all &ldquo;you need to wear your shoes&rdquo; (or something like that)
and I put my bag down saying something like, &ldquo;okay jesus fucking
christ&rdquo; and they both went away while I had my bag open, during which
time I determined that I do <em>not</em> have my sandals in this bag; they
are in my checked bag.</p>

<p>So I started walking toward the plane again and Lin admonished me to
calm down.  I agreed that I had acted inappropriately, but when she
was like, &ldquo;so what do we do now without your shoes?&rdquo; I go, &ldquo;we just get
on the plane; they can go get my shoes off the plane if they want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No other crew/staff said anything until I was actually on board.  (safe!)</p>

<p>A flight attendant goes, &ldquo;where are your shoes?&rdquo; and this time I was
more apologetic, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry they&rsquo;re in my <em>checked</em> baggage&rdquo;</p>

<p>she goes, &ldquo;are you kidding me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry; I&rsquo;ve been barefoot for 7 years so I didn&rsquo;t really think about
it.&rdquo;  I didn&rsquo;t explain further that when I was on Qantas, they didn&rsquo;t
bug me.</p>

<p>By the time we were seated (in row 40 because the rows are marked in a
confusing way and the couple designated for row 40 were in our row
(41)), the flight attendant brought me some slippers which Lin
surmised were from first class.</p>

<p>I hope I get a chance to apologize to the first crewmember for acting
like an ass, though I haven&rsquo;t seen her on board.</p>
