<ol>
<li>been a while since I&rsquo;ve done a state of my life address</li>
<li>Lin and I have been married for 5 years</li>
<li>We live in Higashi Yurigaoka, and regularly use Shin Yurigaoka station</li>
<li>We just had a party the other day for our house warming.  We&rsquo;ve lived in the house since June 2nd of this year.</li>
<li>For Obon we went to Umi-no-koen on Seaside Line.  The water was warm and filled with seaweed.  Wind was quite blowy, making for a sandblasted walk back to the wooded area.</li>
<li>On that day, I forgot my sandals, so ended up buying new sandals before going to work.  Got new slacks too because the ones I had selected had a rip in the crotch.</li>
<li>I still work for JB teaching English, and AB and  CB doing websites.</li>
<li>Nate is supposed to have sent a template and instructions for a new single page site, but it hasn&rsquo;t happened yet.</li>
<li>Jennie was bitten by some animal over a month ago, and still has pus oozing from the hole in her neck.  The vet has had her on antibiotics, and it&rsquo;s slowly getting better, but dang.</li>
<li>As a result, we don&rsquo;t let Jennie outside.  I&rsquo;d love to let her outside but Lin has been convinced that it&rsquo;s better for Jennie to lead a long boring less-expensive life than to lead and exciting life running around outside fighting infectious animals and requiring vet visits.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve gotten pretty good at popping pills into her mouth behind her tongue so she has to swallow them.</li>
<li>Recently saw Kan speak; it was my second time to attend one of his events.</li>
<li>He talked about completely different stuff this time, which is apparently the case every time.</li>
<li>I left my green yoga mat at the restaurant after the Kan event and Rohini has it now.</li>
<li>Last week was a holiday, but Y from GG still requested a lesson at the normal lesson time.</li>
<li>Might start doing private lessons with her, but not sure yet.</li>
<li>MM lessons are now just M lessons unless SP comes.</li>
<li>No longer doing SS lessons; they said they were busy. bummer</li>
<li>Also teaching a lesson on Mondays for Tariq.</li>
<li>In art department, I&rsquo;ve been drawing regularly.  Just presented Toshie with her piece, with her name hidden in the drawing.</li>
<li>I alos just finished my first set of 25 little pieces.  The first several were all drawn based on the previous one (except the very first) and ones after that were drawn from memory based on what I had been drawing..  so they&rsquo;re like a game of telephone  in that the picture slightly changed over time.</li>
<li>My art is visible on my wiki, available via shortlink <a href="https://art.robnugen.com/art">https://art.robnugen.com/art</a> but I want to make it also available via <a href="https://art.robnugen.com/">https://art.robnugen.com/</a> (which is currently my URL shortener gui).  It&rsquo;s probably an easy tweak, but I just gotta get into the code.  Prolly the hardest thing is thinking of a path that I&rsquo;ll remember later, but not need for art, ever.  Maybe <a href="https://art.robnugen.com/shortener">https://art.robnugen.com/shortener</a></li>
<li>There&rsquo;s a metric ton of old journal entries that are lost in date 0000-01-01 because either the YAML headers are fucked or missing and Hugo doesn&rsquo;t know how to parse the date unless it&rsquo;s in this format: 2016-08-19T19:00:12+09:00</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m still using my old backpack even though the other side is beginning to rip.  Need to sew that shit up.</li>
<li>I rearranged my room after Lin kept offering to help and asking if I&rsquo;d do it.  I like it better now.  Thank you babychan!!</li>
<li>In my new room arrangement, I can more easily reach my printer.</li>
<li>Today I had my Tuesday meeting with CB via skype from Kawasaki because they were off on Tuesday.  I did the meeting from Wired Cafe, while using their wifi.  Finished the meeting and oops no cash to pay for lunch.  Good thing they accept Suica (debit card originally used for trains and buses).</li>
<li>Went to conveni on the way to work and they were like, &ldquo;your Suica has only 91 yen&rdquo; though the drink was 140 yen.  Dang.  Fortunately I had store credit on my loyalty card (1.5% back on purchases) so had enough credit to by the drink.</li>
<li>Explained to Hashimoto-san why I couldn&rsquo;t buy bananas, so they gave me a hand of bananas on credit.  So sweet!</li>
<li>On the way home I stopped by the bank to get cash out so I wouldn&rsquo;t have to walk home or something ridiculous like that.</li>
<li>Still walking everywhere barefoot.  On the train as well, and bus, and shopping..  everywhere except when I go to work at a company that expects people to wear shoes, of all things.  I think I&rsquo;ve been at it going on 6 years in Japan, though I wasn&rsquo;t totally consistent when I started 6 years ago.  I&rsquo;m counting it as 1 year longer than when Lin and I got married, because..  well I was in Thailand before that; maybe I should peg it at the time we got married; it won&rsquo;t be overstating it.  But who cares?  dang.  6 years what are you gonna do about it?</li>
<li>Just chatted with Sally today; she&rsquo;s doing well and went to the trampoline place where Fred and I went in January, but there were too many young kids (sum sum summertime summer time) for her to feel comfortable jumping without double-bounce-launching them to dangerous heights.  aww man!!  bummer.</li>
<li>Arriving in Noborito soon.  Gotta change trains from Nambu Line to Odakyu Line.  We live on Odakyu Line now!  How weird is that?</li>
<li>Been studying Japanese with Yuri about 3 times per week. Some people have said my speaking is getting better.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve nearly nearly completed my dig on Delta (Minecraft server).  I dug a tunnel down to level 10 or so and then dug a large hole around the staircase, leaving a tube staircase in the middle.</li>
<li>Tokyo I-group meets every other Monday, including this coming Monday, in Hiroo from 6pm to 8pm.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ll be staffing in Perth again in October 2016; it will be my second time to staff there, and my 3rd staffing overall.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m also attending an e-I-group via Zoom each week on Thursdays Tokyo time.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve posted several (a dozen?) pieces of art on <a href="https://www.stellartisan.com/vendor/rob-nugen-colorful-lines-on-shikishi76105ACE">Stellartisan</a></li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve switched from Reddit to Hacker News as my first stop online as it&rsquo;s more focused on stuff I care about instead of memes and shit.  Granted, I did subscribe to several dumb subreddits.</li>
<li>Been digging through Ansible tutorials; basically want to automate deployment of servers I have on AWS.  Been slowing getting stuff figured out.</li>
<li>Recently found a great set of videos <a href="https://sysadmincasts.com/episodes/43-19-minutes-with-ansible-part-1-4">Learning Ansible with Vagrant</a></li>
<li>I call Fred every night at 11pm, which is currently 9am in Austin.  Need to get his ass up and working on his thesis!  Hopefully he&rsquo;ll have it done before the time changes in September.</li>
<li>We are having a cute little earthquake.  I wonder how big it will be.  Still shaking a bit as I write.</li>
<li>It wasn&rsquo;t so big here, but apparently about <a href="https://www.jma.go.jp/en/quake/20160819211049392-192107.html">5.4 in Ibaraki</a>. <a href="https://archive.is/Hp4On">https://archive.is/Hp4On</a></li>
