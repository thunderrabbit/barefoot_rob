      <description>14:38 Wednesday 09 May 2018 JST I am not sure how all this works, but I plan to join Soness&amp;rsquo;s Get Booked to Speak in a Week class starting tomorrow. So that means between tomorrow and the week after, I should get booked to speak. Does it count if I get booked today, before the class starts?
It&amp;rsquo;s not really a speaking engagement, but come on out to Bar GariGari on June 1st for story telling night</description>
