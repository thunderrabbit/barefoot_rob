      <description>08:41 Tuesday 30 June 2015 JST Not sure what happened, but I added a room to my level, exited cleanly from portal 2 and steam, came back, and my changes were gone when I tried to edit the level again.</description>

      <description>09:06 Tuesday 02 June 2015 JST Good luck with your site. I&#39;m blocking you as spam because of the way you set up the email link. My friend wanted to connect with me so I click YES in the email, but the screen to which I am sent is a New Account screen with no login option. I then visited wayn.com directly and via cookies you still said Please Register instead of giving a login screen.</description>

      <description>##11:51 Saturday 20 December 2014 JST##
I wrote a message to Travis using (Google) Inbox. Clicked the + icon and his name was helpfully on the list of people to whom I could write. Bingo. Nice!
Got a bounce: the address to which the message was composed was Travis&amp;rsquo; old address! That&amp;rsquo;s not helpful! Booo Inbox for suggesting an old address I haven&amp;rsquo;t used in years for Travis.
So I tried to forward to Travis (new address) the message that I had written to Travis (old address), but I wante d to remove the &amp;ldquo;&amp;mdash; Forwarded message &amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo; header at the top.</description>

      <description>Why can&amp;rsquo;t I log in to AWS? My password is stored in my password manager; my MFA token is working fine. Moe Joe this is not something I want to fight each time I need to make a change on website. Bah.</description>
