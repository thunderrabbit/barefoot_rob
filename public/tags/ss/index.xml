      <description>11:38 Tuesday 10 May 2016 JST Wow I just had the best lesson ever with SS.
I reviewed &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s a thing that ______&amp;rdquo; and then got a fake phone call on a hollow tube.
&amp;quot;Hello?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Oh hey what&#39;s up?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Yeah sorry I&#39;m ______-ing right now&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Okay bye&amp;quot;  I then gave out a paper with 11 action images on it, including 4 screenshots of SS members performing.
I went through the vocab.</description>

      <description>12:03 Tuesday 19 April 2016 JST Today was my fifth lesson with SS, and it seemed like they enjoyed it. I&amp;rsquo;m really trying hard to use the techniques I&amp;rsquo;m learning in my TESOL class online, and it really seems to work!
This week we continued with the vocab words I presented last week. We didn&amp;rsquo;t quite finish the exercise, so I said we&amp;rsquo;ll continue next week.. I hope that works out!</description>

      <description>11:35 Thursday 24 March 2016 JST Lesson this morning was short because my student was late as usual. I spoke with Matt on the way out of the building; told him that I&amp;rsquo;m teaching the SS lessons starting soon.
Online i-group started an hour earlier due to US clocks springing forward so I was a tiny bit late for that.
Now I&amp;rsquo;m about to work on AB site.</description>
