<p>
SWUUSI hasn't even started, but I've already had a lot of fun.  After 
a relatively short trip, I got here at about 4:00 pm.  I came early 
because my mom's on staff.  There was a staff meeting going on when 
we arrived, but I passed the time talking with Nathan Ryan, who was 
in the same predicament as me.  In what seemed like no time at all 
the meeting was over, and the few of us who were here already went 
walking after a short lunch of roast beef, mashed potatoes and gravy, 
peas and corn.  (otherwise known as "the first clash with the lunch 
ladies")  Rob and Jason threw a frisbee back and forth across a small 
part of the lake that juts in, and of course it ended up in the 
water, so Rob swam in to get it.  Later Rob lost his toe ring while 
running across some grass, and I saw him and Jason walking around 
looking for it.  I went to help, and following my instincts I found 
it in about two minutes.  Coincidence?  Then I piggy-backed 
bare-footed Rob across the burr-filled grass to save his feet, and 
dumped him and myself into beautiful lake Texoma.  I probably should 
have remembered to take my wallet and everything else out of my 
pockets before I jumped in fully clothed and shod.
</p>
<p>
The water was body temperature, perfect for an evening swim.  The 
lake is great, only two stone's-throws from the main building, but it 
seems longer if you happen to be carrying Jason Fricke on your back.  
And the main building is nice, too, although the game room has an 
annoying smell.  The grounds are nice, large and sprawling, or they 
seem that way to me, although I'm sure they will be cut down when the 
boundaries are enforced tomorrow.  We're in a nice, secluded spot, 
with lots of trees where I can hang my hammock.
</p>
<p>
Several of us  stayed in the water for a couple of hours, playing 
Marco Polo and Chicken and King of the Tire (a frustrating game), and 
waving and yelling at passing pontoons.  We all went in before it got 
dark and I have just been hanging out since then.  There's a YAC 
meeting going on right now, tying up most of the people, and I am in 
the oddly-scented room writing this.  Nancy Mauldin, Julie Sexton, 
Debe Barnes, and Emily Sessions are discussing plans and food, with 
occasional helpful comments from Nathan Ryan.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of food, I think we'll have to be careful in the cafeteria 
as best we can, because the cafeteria ladies were a little, um, 
disturbed today at lunch.  One of them asked one of the advisors if 
we were "troubled teens".  Isn't that a bit redundant?  Yes, of 
course.

</p>
<p>
I just got done attending Debe's mud workshop, but I have no idea 
what went on because the air conditioner was so loud that I couldn't 
hear.
</p>
<p>
Last night kicked a lot of ass, but I should start writing where I 
left off last time.  Most of Saturday night and Sunday morning was 
spent in preparation, doing business stuff.  I waited around 
impatiently most of the time while everybody else worked, since I'm 
not on staff.  The first person to show up was Joanna Hessel, forty 
minutes early, and they flowed in pretty steadily after that, until 
everybody was here a couple of hours later.  The last one to arrive 
was Santiago Webber.  He got here earlier today.  This is pretty 
small for a group camp.  There are a total of around seventy people, 
I think seventy-three to be exact, including the advisors and Bryan 
and Tia, the co-deans.
</p>
<p>
The mood last night was joyous, and the activity  didn't stop all 
night.  The main event started when Bryan wanted to shave his head, 
and when we started to do that about six other people decided to do 
the same thing, so it turned into a grand fiasco.  Rob's hair had 
been freshly cut down to 1/8th of an inch, but I cut it even shorter 
with my clippers.  When everyone was finished we were left with some 
thermally-enhanced clippers and a mess of hair on the floor which had 
to be swept up.  We finished with Maia Cudhea being bald (she was the 
first one earlier that evening), and also Rob, Bryan Beck, Keith 
Lawlor, and Frank Roestler had a mowhawk, Adam Lock and Alex 
Riefenstahl had new undercuts, and Tia Lawlor had the back of her 
hair shaved underneath.
</p>
<p>
After that things calmed down a bit and rolled on steadily until 
morning.  Writing this, I have a feeling like I'm leaving out 
something important but I can't think of what it is.
</p>
<p>
This morning when I was going to breakfast I noticed that Rob's head 
looked a little funny, so I felt it and realized that he had shaved 
it all the way down to the skin with Bobby's razor.
</p>
<p>
Um, that's all the important stuff I can think of, and I'm tired of 
writing now.  Signing off.
</p>
<p>
In a good mood,<br>
Dane & Dave

</p>
<p>
The fimo workshop was yesterday, as well as the mud workshop.  The 
special event was casino night, with pixi stik wannabes used for 
money.  I'm sure it was a lot of fun, but I didn't go.  Worship was 
in the library after it, but I didn't go to that either.  I started 
to, but for some reason I just wasn't up to it.  I was in that 
restless mindset where nothing I do feels comfortable.  I feel that 
way a bit now.  All the emotional energy from worship 
tonight built up and then dropped.  I don't think I'll skip worship 
anymore, though.  Tonight's service reminded me how good they can be.
</p>
<p>
The body painting workshop was this morning, and worship planning 
and lamas and candle decorating were later.  I didn't go to any 
workshops today, mostly I just hung out in a lazy fashion.  The 
special event this evening was the visitation by the young adults.  
That was really cool.  I almost went to sleep before worship, but as 
soon as I got into the library I woke up.  For the ceremony, everyone 
was silent while we went around in a circle, each person walking to 
the middle and lighting one of many small candles from the big flame 
in the middle, and discarding the gum we had been given on the way in 
on a saucer representing the community.  Then afterwards we got 
emotional and did lots of hugging and took a picture of all the 
candles melted in the sand.  It turned out that there were exactly 
the right amount of candles for everybody.
</p>
<p>
After worship I tried to do some meditation guided by our chaplain 
Peggy Cheney, but things went wrong and it didn't work.  Maybe next 
time.
</p>
<p>
I know people complain about the whole cafeteria situation, i.e. 
wearing shoes and a shirt, and no swearing, , but for all the good it 
will do here are my thoughts on the subject.  The cafeteria rules are 
a blessing in disguise.  If everything went smoothly then group camp 
would be a lot less exciting.  Variety is the spice of life and our 
problems are a subtle form of variety.  The situation we've been put 
in has sparked a lot of useful creativity.  It's not very hard on us 
at all, but instead is challenging and very entertaining.  I have 
enjoyed all the jokes and pranks that have been a result of the lunch 
ladie's stinginess.  So give them a bow.  They deserve it for making 
group camp more entertaining and memorable.
</p>

In a lighter mood now,<br>

Friday<br>
8-1-97<br>
3:00 am<br>
</p>
<p>
I skipped writing for two whole days this time, so I have some 
catching up to do.  Workshops yesterday were beads and dream 
catchers, and later, in the afternoon, Andy took Debe, Erika, John 
Thompson, Nathan Ryan, Sean Murray, Ben Muller, and me on a geology 
workshop.  We went to the old group camp and learned about fossils.  
Going back to the sight of my first SWUUSI was so wonderful, it 
brought back lots of happy memories of that week two years ago.  I 
saved some big pieces of driftwood for some of my friends who 
had also been there.
</p>
<p>
After that, at 8:30, we took everybody to the lodge in a couple of 
vans for the lamas circle.  Everybody was smudged as he or she 
arrived, and when the circles were formed and the bread was eaten and 
the dance was danced and the friendly, familiar chants were done, I 
felt uplifted, but I didn't get into it as much as last year.  It all 
wasn't as spectacular as the first time.
</p>
<p>
Then we zipped off to the Waffle Shoppe for a midnight snack.  
Surprisingly, they didn't remember us from last year.  I didn't order 
anything, because I wasn't hungry and I wanted to save my money.
</p>
<p>
After I got back to the bio station I settled down and went to sleep. 
I woke up for spirit circle and breakfast, then right after I 
finished eating I sat on a couch in the main room with Tiffany Bush 
and Amber Foreman for 5 straight hours, a new personal record.  I was 
asleep for an hour, and for the last two hours, right before lunch, I 
talked with Rob and Erika.  It started out as an improvised version 
of Rob's Most Important Thing in the World workshop, but was mostly a 
conversation about the nature of god.  I'm not quite sure, so don't 
quote me, but I think we agreed that there is no single most 
important thing to do in life, because if there were it would mean 
that there is only one thing that every person is supposed to be 
doing.  In case you were wondering.
</p>
<p>
This evening we watched a couple of videos that John Thompson had 
shot of people doing wacky things.  They were hilarious and put 
together excellently.  I'm not sure if that was before or after the 
coffeehouse.
</p>
<p>
The coffeehouse was the main event tonight.  I finally got a taste of 
some excellent and enlightening groovy juice (for you, Anna) made by 
Jeremy Loomis-Norris, who, by the way, decided to follow the trend 
and have his head shaved tonight before worship.  The talent show was 
excellent and went right along with the coffeehouse.  There was a lot 
of singing and playing, and the adult staff's descriptions of 
themselves set to the tune of "Yogi Bear", and I personally formed 
1/3 of the three-headed wonder, aided by Willy Wagner and Nathan 
Sexton.
</p>
<p>
The worship tonight was late, 1:00, but it was ten times better than 
anything I had ever been to.  I don't know which was more plentiful;  
the crying, or the laughing.  I didn't cry myself, but there was lots 
of it going on around me.  I don't know why, but for some reason I 
wasn't totally into the worship.  Sure I was emotional, but not as 
much as everyone else was.
</p>
<p>
It ended eventually, then the library was used for a dance, and now 
they are watching videos in there.
</p>
<p>
Wakeup tomorrow is at 6:30, and I'll write all about the morning on 
the way home.
</p>
<p>
Yo, G'night,

<p>


Monday<br>
8/4/97<br>
8:31 am<br>


</p>
<p>I lied, I didn't write on the way home, it is now three days later 
and I am at home.  Reflecting, SWUUSI seems so close, yet so far 
away.
</p>
<p>
Wake up was at 6:30,Friday morning and I stayed up until about fifty 
minutes before that before I finally succumbed and fell asleep on a 
couch in the main room.  According to later reports of eye-witnesses, 
while I was asleep I called out for Dave and my sticks and asked 
Marie Shallin to sit beside me.
</p>
<p>
The first thing I saw when I woke up was Drill Sergeant Debbie 
yelling at me to wake up, then running around screaming randomly and 
abusing Dave, using him to hit things and make noise.  I hadn't been 
asleep for very long so I woke right up and quickly packed the few 
things I had taken out back into my bags and carried them out front 
and set them down.  As it turned out, I had a bunch of various 
belongings scattered about, and every time I turned around I thought 
of another one I had to find and pack.
</p>
<p>
Debbie told me to get the pit empty, so I went upstairs and spread 
the word, then Tia called the touch group leaders and gave them their 
choices of cleanup patrols.  I took the pavilion and the beach, so 
while three guys policed the pavilion, Willy Wagner, Nathan Sexton, 
and I combed the beach for the occasional bit of trash that had been 
dropped in the past week.  Fairly simple.  Our group hadn't left much 
trash, but the beach was already littered with every sort of junk
you can think of: motor oil and anti-freeze containers, soda cans, 
beer bottles and cans, food wrappers, bleach and milk jugs, trot 
lines, and huge mostly-rotten skeletons of catfish and gar.  The 
three of us shared thoughts about how disheartening it was to look at 
the beautiful beach junked up so badly.
</p>
<p>
We went back to the main building and things were coming along.  The 
pit was empty of people and bags so I picked up all the trash I could 
find in it.  After what seemed like a very long time all the cleaning 
was finally finished and we went to the pavilion for closing circle.  
We sang the buzzard song, and yogi bear, and passed a hug, and 
described the week by naming it an adjective, and played the knot 
game, and did the big lap sit thing, and finally the new seniors got 
in a circle in the center and led a round of good friends and while 
it was going suddenly broke out with Bish-Bish.
</p>
<p>
Then we went out front to wait and say our goodbyes there.  It was no 
fun saying goodbye, and it seemed even worse because it was so 
dragged out.  It's a lot easier to say goodbye in twenty minutes than 
it is over two hours.  My mom finally got back with the mug books, 
not quite in time to catch everybody, and the mugbooks were received 
in the cafeteria, some assembly required.  Outside, everyone was all, 
"Seeya in San Antonio, right?"  "Yeah,  you bet."  It seemed like 
forever until most of the youths were finally gone, and it was my 
turn to leave.  There were just a few people who stayed after me, and 
I said goodbye to them one last time.  Aaron Ivener rode to the lodge 
with us, so his parents could pick him up, and with our stuff and his 
stuff, including a guitar and sleeping bag and everything else, the 
entire trunk and every available inch of airspace in the car was 
filled.
</p>
<p>
We got to the lodge and Aaron got in his parent's truck, and we 
caravaned back with them and another guy, Chuck, from Jonesboro, who 
had walkie talkies that the adults played with, and we followed them 
all the way to Hot Springs where we stopped and stayed at my 
grandparent's house until the following morning, and I got a good, 
long night's sleep.  I love all you guys and I miss you a lot, and 
I'll see you whenever we meet again.
</p>
<p>
Later,<br>
Dane & Dave
