      <description>1997 SWUUSI review by Dane Dormio   Saturday

  SWUUSI hasn&#39;t even started, but I&#39;ve already had a lot of fun. After a relatively short trip, I got here at about 4:00 pm. I came early because my mom&#39;s on staff. There was a staff meeting going on when we arrived, but I passed the time talking with Nathan Ryan, who was in the same predicament as me.</description>
