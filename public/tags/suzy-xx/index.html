<p>This was actually sent to me a long time ago, but I&rsquo;m just now getting it posted</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi All, it&rsquo;s been a while I know! Partly my lack of emails is because i&rsquo;m not very good at keeping in touch (as pointed out very clearly by my sister last week!) and partly because I didn&rsquo;t think I had that much to report. I&rsquo;m settled here now and my life has it&rsquo;s routine just like it did in the UK. That&rsquo;s what I thought until I had an instant-messenger conversation with a friend a couple of nights ago:
Me: “Everything&rsquo;s good here, very quiet really, except for the birds, spring is definitely here!”
Neil: “I read things were bad in Hebron, have you been back recently?”
Me “Oh yes, i was there last week and couldn&rsquo;t leave cos the army invaded and sealed off the checkpoint. The settlers had driven a JCB into the Old city- they want to expand their colony and were trying to knock down some Palestinian owned shops. Oh, and Beit Jala was raided early yesterday morning- I slept through it! And another raid into Bethlehem, I swear I&rsquo;m bad luck, everytime I go to do my shopping the army seem to follow me! Not so quiet then I guess&hellip;”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After only 5 months this has all become a bit normal for me. If I don&rsquo;t see it happening with my own eyes i hear of it on the radio or TV- everyday- Hebron, Tubas, Nablus, Jenin, a village, a refugee camp raided, one teenager dead, one child shot but still alive, several with rubber bullet injuries, an elderly woman collapsed from tear gas inhalation. A couple of days ago Al Walajah was raided just as my friend Ahamd was leaving his home. They had come to arrest a 17 year old boy. The only reason Ahmad told me was because it was part of a funny story about the bad day he&rsquo;d had- it started with the army raiding his village and making him late for school, then at school he got into trouble for being late from the headmaster, he was kept back after school but couldn&rsquo;t call to tell his brother as his phone had no credit&hellip;.etc etc. An army helicopter and harrassment from fully armed soldiers was just an incinental part of his story.
This isn&rsquo;t accidental, this normalisation of daily violence and injustice, it&rsquo;s a survival strategy. When I&rsquo;d been here for about three months I went through a period when i couldn&rsquo;t sleep. Whenever i tried my mind would begin to wander and i&rsquo;d strart thinking and getting upset about things I&rsquo;d seen and heard that day: my friend Wael worrying about money, playing with the four lovely children that he&rsquo;s so worried about finding the money to feed, remembering going through the Bethlehem checkpoint and having to explain in bad arabic how it all worked to a bewildered woman visiting her family for the first time if 5 years or remebering that i&rsquo;d noticed that the construction of the aparthied wall was creeping ever closer to Walajeh or thinking about a report on Al Jazeera that quoted Condaliza Rice saying that sanctions on Palestine wouldn&rsquo;t lifted until Hamas recognised Israels right to exist and another report that said that the number of illegal Israeli colonies had increased again during 2006 and&hellip;&hellip;.
It was driving me crazy, and this isn&rsquo;t even my country&hellip;
I told a friend about this and asked how he coped with it day in day out. He said that he&rsquo;d stopped himself thinking about it. If he saw a soldier beating a friend at a checkpoint he&rsquo;d cry about it there and then, and then push all feelings and memories of it aside and lock them away. If he didn&rsquo;t, he&rsquo;d go mad. He advised me to stop watching Al Jazeera just before I go to bed.
So this is what i&rsquo;ve done. Most nights I manage to fall asleep, if i feel my mind wandering i gather up those memories and put them aside. I have wild and crazy dreams and wonder what this is doing to my mental health, but at least i am sleeping.</p>

<p>And all of this after just 5 months. Just imagine what it must be like if this was your country, your entire life, past present and foreseeable future&hellip;.</p>

<p>Two weeks in Bethlehem (a city smaller than Leeds):
Bethlehem city raided three times.
Aida Camp raided twice
Al Walajah village raided one
Al Khader village raided once
Al Souwara village raided once
Beit Jala raided twice
16 taken to unknown locations by the Israeli army.</p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;m losing it&hellip;seriously&hellip;i think I&rsquo;m forgetting the meaning of words like &ldquo;peace&rdquo; and &ldquo;ceasefire&rdquo; and &ldquo;routine&rdquo;. Today I had a day off and went to meet a friend of mine from Bethlehem who has recently started a new job with UNESCO in Ramallah. We met for a long lunch and then went shopping in Ramallah&rsquo;s busy town centre. Then the army arrived. Bulldozers first, shunting parked cars out of the way, some into shop fronts. Close behind were the armoured jeeps. No announcements: tear-gas, then sound grenades, then live fire. A helicopter above, backing up he ground troops with overhead fire. We were caught so unaware that I have to admit we both panicked and fled with other shoppers, young and old into the nearest store. We flinched and held hands with every gunshot and explosion from the other side of the metal shutters. .</p>

<p>Of course, we needn&rsquo;t have worried. This was just a &ldquo;routine arrest operation&rdquo;. So tell me, am I losing it? Have I been here too long? What exactly is routine about four dead people and twenty seriously injured? Routine to me was mothers and children, on holiday from school, going about their business, buying food and clothes, meeting friends for lunch&hellip;.right?</p>

<p>Today in Palestine: Ramallah raided, Bethlehem raided, Tubas raided, two villages close to Bethlehem raided, four dead, 35 injured, 9 arrested, so far. But Israel wants only peace and to protect <em>itself</em> from terrorists. A new colony approved in the West Bank to house the illegal Israeli &ldquo;settlers&rdquo; removed from the Gaza strip; 55,000 new Israeli houses to be built on land stolen from the village I volunteer in, the village that now has an unemployment rate of around 75%&hellip;.peace?</p>

<p>Like I say, i really think i&rsquo;m losing it, I hear the words Israel speaks but my eyes won&rsquo;t let me believe them&hellip;anyone any advice for a confused girl?</p>

                        <p>##10:50 Friday 15 December 2006</p>

<p>Hi everyone,
It&rsquo;s been a while since my last mass email and I&rsquo;ve had a couple of
those &ldquo;are you still alive&rdquo; emails that I love as they prove to me
that you all miss me (ie they&rsquo;re good for my ego!) and make me laugh!
I have to say that I&rsquo;ve started writing this email a few times, but
every time I&rsquo;ve given up as the words seemed a little empty. The past
few weeks in my new home have been, typically, both great and heart
breaking. I&rsquo;m now working in the village Walajah that i emailed you
all about a few weeks ago. It&rsquo;s great to be part of such a small,
close community, and as such I&rsquo;m having to walk up all of the steep
hills around here to work off all of the food I&rsquo;m being fed at every
opportunity! It can be so quiet and peaceful here, that it&rsquo;s easy to
forget about the &ldquo;situation&rdquo; (as everyone here calls it!), and think
that i&rsquo;m living in some pretty Mediterranean town (which I am).
However,  and there&rsquo;s always a however, in the past week and a half
there&rsquo;s been three incursions by the army.
The first was to demolish a building and a house. After much arguing,
a local lawyer prevented the home demolition, but the outbuilding was
destroyed.
The second was in the early hours.The army came and forced a family
out of their home with tear gas and sound grenades. They then forced
the father of the family to strip to his underwear in the freezing
cold and lay on the ground before arresting him. His crime? He works
for an orphanage in Bethlehem that is supported by the social services
part of Hamas. He is still detained. His teenage daughter who I&rsquo;ve
been helping with her english homework was too upset to attend an exam
last week.
The third is the one that always gets me. Two days ago the home of
Monder Hamad was demolished for the second time this year, to make way
for &ldquo;the wall&rdquo; deemed illegal by the International court. So this is
my problem: witnessing this was one of the most traumatic points of my
life, and this isn&rsquo;t my house, my village or even my country. How can
i scrape together the words to describe how heart breaking it is to
watch such a personal injustice occur? A family torn apart by well
armed teenagers with all of the power, friends and family kept away
unable to offer comfort. A few of us able to help the family empty
their lives out onto the street before&hellip;. Even as I write it now it
seems empty. The soldier&rsquo;s reply to the desperate question: &ldquo;where
shall we live?&ldquo;&hellip;.&ldquo;We gave you a tent last time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So do me a favour, think about how this would make you feel, spare us
a thought over the holidays, and next time you hear about Hamas
refusing to recognise Israels right to exist bear in mind the
continuous humiliations and tragedies inflicted on every Palestinian:
man, woman and child.</p>
