This was actually sent to me a long time ago, but I&amp;rsquo;m just now getting it posted
 Hi All, it&amp;rsquo;s been a while I know! Partly my lack of emails is because i&amp;rsquo;m not very good at keeping in touch (as pointed out very clearly by my sister last week!) and partly because I didn&amp;rsquo;t think I had that much to report. I&amp;rsquo;m settled here now and my life has it&amp;rsquo;s routine just like it did in the UK.</description>

I think I&amp;rsquo;m losing it&amp;hellip;seriously&amp;hellip;i think I&amp;rsquo;m forgetting the meaning of words like &amp;ldquo;peace&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;ceasefire&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;routine&amp;rdquo;. Today I had a day off and went to meet a friend of mine from Bethlehem who has recently started a new job with UNESCO in Ramallah. We met for a long lunch and then went shopping in Ramallah&amp;rsquo;s busy town centre. Then the army arrived. Bulldozers first, shunting parked cars out of the way, some into shop fronts.</description>

Hi everyone, It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since my last mass email and I&amp;rsquo;ve had a couple of those &amp;ldquo;are you still alive&amp;rdquo; emails that I love as they prove to me that you all miss me (ie they&amp;rsquo;re good for my ego!) and make me laugh! I have to say that I&amp;rsquo;ve started writing this email a few times, but every time I&amp;rsquo;ve given up as the words seemed a little empty.</description>
