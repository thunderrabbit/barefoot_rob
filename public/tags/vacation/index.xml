      <description>14:24 Friday 29 December 2017 -02 Actually, tomorrow is our last full day, but some of it will be spent flying to Sao Paulo. Our flight to Dubai leaves at 1am Sunday morning.
We just finished lunch after Dom and Rose taught me and Jorge(sp) to play rummy. I had never played before.
14:50 The pool has just been vacuumed and now it&amp;rsquo;s time to swim!</description>

      <description>14:19 Saturday 23 December 2017 -03 Lin and I just walked along the beach from the restaurante de churrascos (sp) after pretty much gorging on all the offerings.
I saw some really neat rivulets on the beach (but forgot to take a picture) where water seems to just spring from the beach. I guess that is exactly what&amp;rsquo;s happening; water within the sand works its way out and then comes down to the ocean.</description>
