      <description>05:07 Sunday 31 December 2017 -02 I have had a few crashes in Godot in the over the past couple of days, and each time it was due to using queue_free() (or apparently misusing it). I took them out in favor of hide() and remove(). The crashes seem to have gone away.
14:42 Sunday 31 December 2017 -02 (44 minutes to Dubai) I would like to extend my custom Godot class, but have not been able to figure out how to do it.</description>
