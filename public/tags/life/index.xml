      <description>15:27 Wednesday 05 October 2016 JST Lin and I went to see Babaji this morning at Paola&amp;rsquo;s house. I asked him what to do when I get pissed off at Lin and want to yell at her or break up with her. He said when I feel the anger, instead of quarreling with her, I should walk away until the feeling leaves on its own.
I asked what to do with the feeling that I&amp;rsquo;ve married the wrong person.</description>

      <description>12:08pm Monday 24 April 2000
Several journal entries are on my computer at my house. They&amp;rsquo;ll flood my website as soon as we get a dial tone!
Life without email seems just as hectic as life with the extra requirement to dig through all the spam, all the &amp;gt;&amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; forwards, all the email crap I get. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I want the stuff that is funny.</description>
