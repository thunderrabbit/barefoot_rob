<p>Right now I am in a coffee shop in Lazona, and about to go to SCC
lessons for 3 hours, and then GG lesson for 1 hour.</p>

<h2 id="18-02-thursday-22-march-2018-jst">18:02 Thursday 22 March 2018 JST</h2>

<p>Tears were apparently shed by one of the students at SCC; she is
scheduled to present tomorrow and found out today that her
presentation is going to be different than what she expected/practiced
for.  Yikes stripes I wish I could help more, but I suggested some
simplifications that will hopefully make it easier.</p>

<p>Now I am in Akihabara, across the street from GG lesson which starts
at 18:30.</p>

<p>I bought a trackball mouse to replace the one I had before which seems
to just mysteriously and annoyingly not work anymore.  This time I
will keep the receipt because I think the old one konked out before
its warranty was up.</p>

<p>After working 3 hours (5 lessons) near Lazona, I&rsquo;m eating cold lunch
in Akihabara across the street from GG lesson. I have Lin&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s
heavy-as-hell suitcase.  (Now I know why gorillas cannot break them)</p>

<p>Lesson was great; everyone was there!  Yoko, Maki, and Atusko all
brought sweets!  Mayumi and Toshie both did homework!</p>

<p>Talking about puzzles near the end of our lesson, I remembered the
word puzzles with five houses, five owners, five colors, five pets,
and five jobs.</p>

<p>Several clues are given and then the question: &ldquo;Who likes fishing?&rdquo;
can be solved with a little logic.</p>

<p>SO, I attempted to create such a puzzle for GG, but with only 3 houses
because I only had 5 minutes to do it:</p>

<ul>
<li>There are three houses, three nationalities, and three pets.</li>
<li>The Canadian lives next to the dog owner.</li>
<li>The American lives in the green house.</li>
<li>The owner of the blue house has a fish.</li>
<li>The fish is not next to the Frenchman&rsquo;s house.</li>
<li>The owner of the red house is French.</li>
<li>The dog lives in the middle house.</li>
<li>Who owns the cat?</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, the huge caveat: I don&rsquo;t know if this can be solved.  I have a
feeling the details of the neighborhood cannot be completely solved
because there&rsquo;s no indication of left vs right.</p>

<p>How does one prove if this kind of question has the correct number of
clues?</p>

<p>In other news, I showed them Pop Pop Chaos after the lesson.  M was
interested but T was not, and A was like, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a computer or
a smartphone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I love A. Today she told me she doesn&rsquo;t have AC.  Awesome!</p>

<p>GG lesson that night featured a discussion of Airplane Day; they were
all shocked to know three towers had fallen that day.  I&rsquo;m curious if
they&rsquo;ll do some research on their own. T told me after class she
couldn&rsquo;t believe it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m about an hour early; I&rsquo;m going to look at laptops to see what I
can see.  I should prolly also jump on TLUG list or go to a meeting
before buying anything&hellip;</p>

<h2 id="18-15">18:15</h2>

<p>I wandered around a bit and couldn&rsquo;t find anything good in any of the
smaller shops.  Even when I found things that seemed basically good,
they had Japanese keyboards, which aren&rsquo;t good for me.</p>

<p>Went to a couple big box stores.  One said they don&rsquo;t sell machines
without an OS installed.  The other one said come back later (I
think), and I might.  But not tonight.</p>

<h2 id="20-00">20:00</h2>

<p>The lesson was great, as usual.  GG are just so positive, inquisitive,
thoughtful, and lovely!</p>

<p>They had a meeting afterward, so we didn&rsquo;t walk to the station
together.  That worked out well; I had planned to tell them I was
going to go to 80s Cafe.</p>

<p>I went to 80s Cafe for the English lesson there.  It was a much
smaller group than the Japanese lessons, but still the same kinda
format: one instructor and students.  I seemed to be the only native
English speaker on the student side of things.</p>

<p>After the lesson ended at 9, everyone promptly left, and Wada-san and
I chatted about junk, arriving at cheesemaking as my next plan.</p>

<p>Today before GG lesson, T asked A (in English) if she had read M&rsquo;s email.  A said
she had not.</p>

<p>I used this simple exchange as the basis for fully 45 minutes of
lesson:</p>

<pre><code>T: &quot;Did you read M's email?&quot;
A: &quot;No I didn't.&quot;

R: &quot;What did you ask her?&quot;
T: &quot;I asked her if she had read M's email.&quot;
R: &quot;and what did she say?&quot;
T: &quot;She said she hadn't.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>(^_^)V</p>

<pre><code>R: &quot;What did she ask you?&quot;
A: &quot;She asked me if I had read M's email.&quot;
R: &quot;and what did you tell her?&quot;
A: &quot;I told her I hadn't.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>(^_^)V</p>

<p>Then, when M arrived, I asked her to ask T what she had asked A.</p>

<pre><code>M: &quot;What did you ask A?&quot;
T: &quot;I asked her if she had read your email.&quot;
M: &quot;What did she say?&quot;
T: &quot;She said she hadn't.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>(^_^)V</p>

<p>And then I had M ask A what she had been asked.</p>

<pre><code>M: &quot;What did T ask you?&quot;
A: &quot;She asked me if I had read your email.&quot;
M: &quot;What did you tell her?&quot;
A: &quot;I told her I hadn't.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>(^_^)V</p>

<p>And then we went a step deeper.</p>

<pre><code>R: &quot;Sorry, M, what did you ask T?&quot;
M: &quot;I asked her what she had asked A.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>(^_^)V</p>

<pre><code>R: &quot;T, what did M ask you?&quot;
T: &quot;She asked me what I had asked A.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>(^_^)V</p>

<pre><code>R: &quot;A, what did M ask T?&quot;
A: &quot;She asked what T had asked me.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>(^_^)V</p>

<p>Then, while I was checking homework, M smartly asked T if she could
see her notebook (which I had just corrected).</p>

<pre><code>R: &quot;What did you ask her?&quot;
M: &quot;I asked her if she would show me her notebook.&quot;
M: &quot;I aksed her if I could see her notebook.&quot;
M: &quot;I asked for her notebook.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Headed home from GG lesson in Akihabara. Today we ended up with 7
pages of notes.  And, today was the first time they invited me to ride
the train home with them. Nice! Same line so it&rsquo;s convenient.  I ended
up telling them about KTRU and how much fun it was to DJ there back in
the day.  I have several tapes recorded from my shows; I wonder about
the legality of putting them on soundcloud or something.</p>

<p>Probably illegal; we certainly wouldn&rsquo;t want to promote some
relatively obscure artist, now would we, FCC?</p>

<p>Walking to the station, I spoke to M about journaling, saying the she
should just keep going with old journals and not equate a lapse with
tossing the old journal.</p>

<p>Great lesson with GG tonight; after discussing customs related to
death in Japan (put money in the box so the person can cross The Styx,
but don&rsquo;t put coins cause they don&rsquo;t burn), we primarily reviewed
their homework on reported speech.  I had asked them to use reported
speech for a picture in their textbook, and they were great!  T had
the great idea of writing the original speech from which she created
the reported speech.  Nice!</p>
