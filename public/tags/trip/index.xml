      <description>16:50 Wednesday 13 March 2019 JST In preparation for this trip, I started my packing list a few weeks ago.
I had planned to copy it here, but for now, just imagine it.
I pre-packed most of the list a couple days ago, getting down to computer, phone, and other stuff I could not pack because I use it daily.
This morning I woke up early, and repacked everything, doublechecking the list, and taking pictures of all of it, in some kind of just in case scenario that will not happen.</description>

      <description>22:10 Wednesday 30 January 2019 JST Just a couple days ago I got my tickets all sorted to staff two different NWTA weekends and also attend the MKP USA Face to Face weekend in Texas.
After pretty much settling on the plans, it was pointed out that attending an IGFT might give me more of the training I am looking for, but I trust this is the training / trip I need.</description>
