<p>Max and I met at The Pink Cow where Lin and I were going to meet,
but she ended up heading home instead after work.  After filling up on
world famous bean burritos at The Pink Cow, we walked to Roppongi
Midtown where we spent a considerable amount of time wondering how to
measure if the circular glass window over the white
not-really-egg-shaped stone is round or not.  I ultimately decided it
was not round because the wires inside the glass (which travel at 45
degree angles to the edge) did not bisect the quadrangle shapes,
making them rectangle, not square.</p>

<p>With the tools we had available, I could not think of a way.  The
best I could think of would be to take a string on opposite sides of
the shape and walk around the circumfrence.</p>

<p>Max decided to try barefooting with me so he took off his shoes
and we headed down the escalator and to the white stone to get the
only pictures of the night.</p>

<p>Headed to Roppongi Hills and wandered around on different surfaces
from astroturf to vents blowing air up through the floor.</p>

<p>Went back to Roppongi Crossing and down the bar-crawl street to chat
with the Nigerian guys who invite us into the bar.  Tonight I claimed
I could not afford shoes, and one guy said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s nice to see some
poor people around here,&rdquo; which Max and I decided was a really
funny thing to say/hear.</p>

<p>We ended up going up into a bar for a moment because the guy said it
was free, but bounced after talking to them a bit upstairs.  It&rsquo;s free
<em>if</em> we buy a drink.  Max was like &ldquo;let&rsquo;s bounce&rdquo; so we headed out and
he goes &ldquo;that was scary,&rdquo; citing that they would &ldquo;probably&rdquo; spike our
drinks, etc.  Yeah, it could happen, and would definitely not be my
intended way to enjoy an evening!  I wonder how to protect against
that except pour my own drink or see the bottle be opened.</p>

<p>The next guy said we can go to a real topless bar, but we did not head
up there (it was definitely not free), but I asked if I could come
back with Lin.  He was like &ldquo;yeah sure&rdquo; so I guess it would be okay.
Doubt she would go for it, but could be fun.</p>

<p>Headed home via Nogizaka station where I gave Max a hug and see ya
sometime.</p>
