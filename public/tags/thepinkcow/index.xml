      <description>22:28 Tuesday 04 April 2017 JST Before Tokyo men&amp;rsquo;s circle tonight, I met Christine to learn a bit more about the training she has done, and to get a NIN poster from when she worked on their tour!!
I stopped by The Pink Cow to say HI and get the best burrito in the world. Went outside to look for Christine and three (3) police officers approached me and asked if they could go through all my stuff.</description>
