Outside the Kagoshima airport there&amp;rsquo;s a hot foot bath, which I enjoyed for a bit over an hour. Jon joined me for a smaller bit over an hour, but a solid hour nonetheless. (I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I&amp;rsquo;ve used the word nonetheless before)
Afterward, I kept my shoes off, so I&amp;rsquo;m barefoot on the airplane. Awww yeah so nice.</description>

Near the gates, there was a padded area featuring some foam rubber panels which could be linked together. I made a triangular tube and then added a square tube and then realized I could make a short T shape and then realized there were enough pieces to make a tall T shape, and THEN realized that I could get inside.</description>

大風呂 (hot baths) were nice! I heard Lin and Rohini and I boofed for Lin, but she didn&amp;rsquo;t hear me. (weird)
We&amp;rsquo;re about to put on warm clothes and head out to the field.

Turns out Lin did hear me! She was like, &amp;ldquo;I hear Rob!&amp;rdquo; and said Hellooo but Rohini was like, &amp;ldquo;Rob said he wasn&amp;rsquo;t coming,&amp;rdquo; so Lin didn&amp;rsquo;t pursue it.</description>
