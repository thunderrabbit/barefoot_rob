After ママ received presents and while we were eating cake, Mikarin and Takumi did a magic show. Most of them were &amp;ldquo;look over there!&amp;rdquo; tricks, but in one, Mikarin did a bit of memorization / card manipulation. They didn&amp;rsquo;t Fool Us (or at least didn&amp;rsquo;t fool me), but it better than an obvious misdirect trick.</description>
