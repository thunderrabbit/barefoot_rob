I was beaten soundly by Mr Bandecca 4 or 5 games in a row. I kinda felt bad, since he had commented about how he wanted a workout, not to just piss around.. He was very nice about it, and I believe sincere when he said he enjoyed playing. That&amp;rsquo;s cool.
Last night I got a call from Cheri, who said she was going out with some guy who&amp;rsquo;s 31, apparently a real charmer, he&amp;rsquo;s made comments about her nice blonde hair &amp;amp; &amp;ldquo;good proportions&amp;rdquo; and commented that he&amp;rsquo;d like to take pictures of her.</description>

Cheri is on the phone with me &amp;amp; bawling her eyes out about John Baker, the &amp;ldquo;Jerk off&amp;rdquo; (cheri said it). Well she was crying but she&amp;rsquo;s happy now.
We&amp;rsquo;re planning to go to the zoo and we just determined that we&amp;rsquo;ve known each other since 1986. Cool, man.</description>
