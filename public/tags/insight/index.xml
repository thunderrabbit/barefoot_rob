      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve all heard the quote something like
Insanity is repeating the same thing and expecting a different result.  I just realized that I have been trying to apply that quote too strongly in my life. I have low-key assumed I have to make some huge radical change in my life in order to have anything different.
