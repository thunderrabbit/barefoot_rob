      <description>15:34 Monday 05 March 2018 JST To pursue his dream of travel, Rob gave up his comfortable life in Texas, including house, car, cat, and fiance. Just to see what else is out there. Fascinated with time, Rob has started a stop-motion animation project, likely to take ten years. He has also started writing a novel, which is being presented backwards, one word at a time. Walking around barefoot as often as possible, Rob hopes to inspire others to do what they like, regardless of what other people may think.</description>

      <description>13:14 Wednesday 17 January 2018 JST Often seen walking barefoot around Tokyo, Rob likes baring his soles as well as his soul. &amp;ldquo;The long term goal is to reduce the suicide rate in Tokyo&amp;rdquo; he says with a wistful gaze. &amp;ldquo;It just seems like such a waste of human potential for someone to kill themselves instead of talk about their problems.&amp;rdquo;
To facilitate talking about problems, he leads peer counseling circles in Tokyo.</description>
