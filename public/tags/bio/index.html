<pre><code>To pursue his dream of travel, Rob gave up his comfortable life in
Texas, including house, car, cat, and fiance. Just to see what
else is out there.

Fascinated with time, Rob has started a stop-motion animation
project, likely to take ten years.  He has also started writing a
novel, which is being presented backwards, one word at a time.

Walking around barefoot as often as possible, Rob hopes to inspire
others to do what they like, regardless of what other people may
think.

Not knowing what to do in life, Rob often prescribes to Bashar's
suggestion that people should do what excites them most at any
given moment.

At the current ongoing moment, that is organizing peer counseling
circles for men and women in Tokyo.  Growing from 3 men to 9 men
and 4 women in two years.

<p>Often seen walking barefoot around Tokyo, Rob likes baring his soles
as well as his soul. &ldquo;The long term goal is to reduce the suicide rate
in Tokyo&rdquo; he says with a wistful gaze.  &ldquo;It just seems like such a
waste of human potential for someone to kill themselves instead of
talk about their problems.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To facilitate talking about problems, he leads peer counseling circles
in Tokyo.  One is just for men using protocols from The Mankind
Project (mkp.org) The other is co-gender, because &ldquo;as far as I know,
nothing like this exists for women in Tokyo (and I can&rsquo;t join a
women&rsquo;s circle).&rdquo;</p>

<p>Speaking about the value of emotional literacy and how it can
transform relationships of all varieties, Rob speaks from experience.
&ldquo;I met people from The Mankind Project in 1996.  I was delighted to
meet people who could be authentic and even vulnerable with one
another.  They seemed to relate to one another on a deeper level.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Attending the New Warrior Training Adventure in 1997 was &ldquo;huge for
me.  It was the first time in my life I realized I was a man.  I was
27 at the time.&rdquo;</p>
