      <description>19:40 Friday 27 October 2017 JST Playing the stupid paperclip game cost me $50. Okay, maybe I am stupid instead of the game, but due to its clever design, I waited to the last minute to get my train (for a substitute lesson in a location with which I am unfamiliar). My train ended up being late, I missed(*) my next connection, and the client said &amp;ldquo;screw it&amp;rdquo; and cancelled the lesson.</description>

      <description>21:40 Wednesday 16 November 2016 JST Dear agent, when you are able to understand this question, can you let me know why Marcellus Wallace said &amp;ldquo;you leave town tonight, right now&amp;rdquo; to Butch in Pulp Fiction?
Why &amp;ldquo;tonight, right now&amp;rdquo;? Was that in the script? Was it improvised?
I don&amp;rsquo;t have internet access right now, and I&amp;rsquo;ll probably forget about the question by the time I get home so please answer when you have a chance (after you exist).</description>
