A month ago or so, someone broke into Wende&amp;rsquo;s apartment and stole most of her jewelry, including her Aggie Ring. Of all the items, she says, there&amp;rsquo;s only 4 that she really really wants to have back. Her Aggie Ring is one of them.
Yesterday, she got a call from the Aggie Ring Office; her ring has been found!
A (homeless?) woman tried to sell it so she could feed her kids.</description>
