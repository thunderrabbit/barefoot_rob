<p>I&rsquo;ve finished a minute and 21 seconds worth of Marble Track 3 video.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s exactly one piece that crosses over another track.  In the image below, the pink character is standing on that piece which is marked with black.</p>

<p><a href="//b.robnugen.com/art/marble_track_3/2013/05/IMG_2813x1000.jpg"><img src="//b.robnugen.com/art/marble_track_3/2013/05/thumbs/IMG_2813x1000.jpg" alt="IMG 2813x1000" /></a></p>

<p>The other pieces marked in black are the continuation of that track, which ends in the lower middle of MT3. (hmm I&rsquo;m using the word &ldquo;track&rdquo; to describe a single track and &ldquo;track&rdquo; to describe the entire thing.)</p>

<p>Parallel to that track is marked in purple.  The purple dotted piece has just been cut by the green guy, who is about to cut where the purple line crosses the piece.</p>

<p>On either outer edge, light blue and light green lines mark the tracks so far.</p>

<p>The white guy with green head is about to pick up sticks to have them cut and cross the end of the black track with the purple track.</p>

<p>Yellow guy with green backpack is going to take the cut pieces and place them as berms on the lower right 180 degree turn.  Pink and white guys are going to place the piece Pink is holding; it will be the second piece to cross over another track.</p>

<p>But first, I&rsquo;m going to the iOS meetup in Shiboooyah!</p>

<p><strong>10:46pm Friday 17 May 2013</strong></p>

<p>I had been using <a href="https://cyberduck.ch">Cyberduck</a>, but it has to update the entire huge file each time so takes too long and cannot recover from network errors.</p>

<p>I found and even installed <a href="https://www.expandrive.com/">expandrive</a> but it&rsquo;s not free, so I kept looking</p>

<p>I looked at <a href="https://code.google.com/p/boar/">boar</a> which would probably do just fine, but I did a couple more searches</p>

<p>I found <a href="https://caca.zoy.org/wiki/git-bigfiles">git-bigfiles</a> which would probably also do fine,</p>

<p>Then I found a quite recent article with several of my preferred keywords: <a href="https://dreamhost.com/dreamscape/2013/02/11/backing-up-to-dreamobjects-with-duplicity/">Backing up to DreamObjects with Duplicity</a></p>

<p>Everything went pretty smoothly with a couple caveats.  Note: the following isn&rsquo;t meant to be a tutorial so much as a reminder to myself how I installed Duplicity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p> brew install librsync python gpg ncftp</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this failed until I ran</p>

<blockquote>
<p>brew update</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now back on track, but you should use <a href="https://duplicity.nongnu.org/">latest version of Duplicity</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p> tar xvzf duplicity-0.6.21.tar.gz</p>

<p> pip install boto httplib2 oauth</p>

<p> cd duplicity-0.6.21</p>

<p> sudo python setup.py install</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now save the following into ~/.boto</p>

<pre><code>[Credentials]
aws_access_key_id = xxxxxxxx your access key xxxxxxxxx
aws_secret_access_key = xxxxxxxxxxxx your secret key here xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
</code></pre>

<p>Yay ready to go</p>

<blockquote>
<p> duplicity &ndash;allow-source-mismatch ~/Documents/duplicity/ s3://objects.dreamhost.com/duplicity</p>
</blockquote>

<p>duplicity spooked me at first when it responded with this:</p>

<pre><code>Local and Remote metadata are synchronized, no sync needed.
Last full backup date: none
</code></pre>

<p>I was like &ldquo;gah! it didn&rsquo;t backup!!!&rdquo; but just give it some time(*) it should work.</p>

<p>(*) it took less time than for me to find another possible candidate: <a href="https://s3tools.org/s3cmd">s3cmd</a></p>

<p>Just as the green guy was going to cut a stick for yellow backpack guy, another guy&rsquo;s stick moved into the way and was lopped off. I&rsquo;m headed to work now while green guy is in the middle of an apology shrug.</p>

<p>In the foreground, pink guy and green head guy have just placed two long sticks on the originally constructed 180 degree turn.</p>

<p>In other words, the scene looks like this:</p>

<p>Though I didn&rsquo;t know it at the time, this is as far as I would get on
my third attempt to make Marble Track 3 before it all had to be packed
up to move to our new house in 2013.</p>

<p><strong>9:11pm Monday 13 May 2013</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve finished 56 seconds so far of Marble Track 3. The white and pink characters are gluing the 180 degree turn in the second corner (of four corners). I&rsquo;ve got plans in mind for the two center tracks.. hmm maybe I can scribble a bit on a photo. brb.</p>

<p><a href="//b.robnugen.com/art/marble_track_3/2013/05/IMG_2802.jpg"><img src="//b.robnugen.com/art/marble_track_3/2013/05/thumbs/IMG_2802.jpg" alt="IMG 2802" /></a></p>

<p>Okay so in the lower right corner, the white and pink guys are placing pieces for the second of four 180 degree turns in each corner.</p>

<p>In the lower left corner, the yellow guy with green backpack is placing a retaining wall on the first 180 degree turn that they made.</p>

<p>The green guy in the back is the cutter; he has nothing to do right now, so is just waiting.</p>

<p>The (future) 180 turns are marked with (dashed) black lines.</p>

<p>The red lines mark where the marbles will arrive after navigating the 180 degree turns.</p>

<p>The red spots on the edge of the center line mark where marbles will arrive after navigating the light blue and light green lines.</p>

<p>The light blue and light green dashed lines show where they marbles will roll before that.</p>

<p>The yellow dashed lines show where the marbles will probably roll before arriving at the 180 degree turns.  I&rsquo;m not sure what I&rsquo;ll do at the point marked with a yellow question mark.  I might make a switch there, but it&rsquo;s so low in the track that it wouldn&rsquo;t be very interesting.</p>

<p>I might have a switch there that decides between a red line arrival and a red dot arrival.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a decision for later, though; right now we&rsquo;re waiting for the glue to dry in the lower right corner so we can place another piece.</p>

<p>step by step</p>

<p>Worked on Marble Track 3 some more today.  This time the green cutter guy cut four ice cream spoons, the pieces of which were distributed to the four corners of the track. I&rsquo;ve started gluing pieces at one of the corners.  I&rsquo;ll probably place some pieces on the two tracks that end along the center line of the track.</p>

<p><strong>1:20am Monday 13 May 2013</strong></p>

<p>I just added five more images and glued one more piece.</p>

<p><strong>8:13pm Saturday 11 May 2013</strong></p>

<p>The first time I started Marble Track 3, I was living in Motosumiyoshi.  I worked on it for a few months, iirc, before losing my job and moving to Soness&rsquo;s living room floor for two years.  The track was shelved and never finished, though I did work on it a bit once Lin and I moved to Kawasaki, but then part of it was broken and it got shelved again when I started working on iPhone apps with Tariq.</p>

<p>I started a new Marble Track 3 about a week ago, finished 17 seconds of animation before losing 80% of said animation due to getting what I paid for with free software.</p>

<p>Payday arrived yesterday and I bought a new marble track base (actually three new bases), and a license for iStopMotion after confirming it was more robust than FrameByFrame.</p>

<p>Four and a half hours later, this is how far I&rsquo;ve gotten.</p>

<p><a href="//b.robnugen.com/art/marble_track_3/2013/05/20130511-202214.jpg"><img src="//b.robnugen.com/art/marble_track_3/2013/05/thumbs/20130511-202214.jpg" alt="20130511-202214" /></a></p>

<p>So far, there are two (2) pieces glued to the base.  Looks like this is going to take a while.  :-)</p>

free time at work and then made this video.</p>


<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

<p>People asked how I made the marble track.  It&rsquo;s a simple question
without a simple answer.  &ldquo;I glued sticks together..&rdquo;</p>

<p>I decided I should answer by showing the pipe cleaner characters
making the track.  So this set of videos (which will eventually be one
video) will answer the question about how to make the track.</p>
