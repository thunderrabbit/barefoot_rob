<p>I spent nearly 3 hours on Marble Track 3 today, but over an hour of it
was trying to figure out how to make Blackmagic Fusion import multiple
sequences of images to put them into one movie.</p>

<p>I was not able to figure it out.</p>

<p>I have a sneaking suspicion that BM Fusion is not designed to do
this.  Most of its output options were images, so.. apparently it is
designed ot output images instead of videos.  It did have an option to
output quicktime, but the default was jpg.</p>

<p>Hmmmm.</p>

<p>This clip includes 1066 frames.  I didn&rsquo;t upload clips the past 2 or 3
times I worked on the track because it took a long time to add the
first three ribs to the edge of the largest marble&rsquo;s track.</p>

<p>Now I am in the process of getting some characters off the set because
they are just じゃま and wasting time during filming.  I already have
the brothers wasting enough time, plus the guy in the back trying to
make his way around the currently-highest point of the largest
marble&rsquo;s track.</p>

<p>I have been on my computer too long today already so might not upload
images.</p>

<p>Sorry future me, but current me is going to take a bit of a break.</p>

<p>I just streamed for 1.25 hours and uploaded a new video clip that
features 8 more seconds of video than in the previously uploaded clip.</p>

<p>I have worked on MT3 a few times since getting back.  A couple days
ago, progress was super slow and I did not even export a video clip,
much less upload one.  Today I got much further, after having figured
out a way to lift the bridge, and then I had the green cutter guy make
some curved toothpicks which will be used for rail supports to keep
the large marbles on track during the 2nd to last U-turn.</p>

<p>The little brother has kicked the chopstick ends back behind the stage
so I don&rsquo;t have to worry about not moving them anymore.  His big
brother is watching him.</p>

<p>After having raised the lower bridge, these three characters are about
to walk up simultaneously (up) toward the stage.</p>

<p>Here is the overview of the set now (after I disassembled the light
fragile triple tripod with upside down tripod).</p>

<p>&lsquo;far as I can tell, I have not yet documented how I back up Marble
Track 3 data.</p>

<pre><code>boto-rsync   --endpoint objects-us-west-1.dream.io . s3://mt3/mt3
</code></pre>

<p>But to be clear, I have not confirmed the restore functionality!</p>

<p>I guess it would be</p>

<pre><code>boto-rsync   --endpoint objects-us-west-1.dream.io s3://mt3/mt3 .
</code></pre>

<p>but are there keys required?  Let&rsquo;s just check.</p>

<pre><code>cd ~
mkdir mt3restore
cd mt3restore
boto-rsync   --endpoint objects-us-west-1.dream.io s3://mt3/mt3 .
</code></pre>

<p>Does that work for you?  It works for me! I don&rsquo;t remember how I set
up boto-rsync, but it probably wasn&rsquo;t too hard.</p>

<p>I added a record 7 seconds of video in just 2 hours.  Part of that was
certainly due to fewer disparate things going on, not the least of
which being that the stage was stopped from turning!</p>

<li>the cutter is just about to cut the excess support off
the ramp base, after which the gluer will lift the base and glue the
pieces to it.</li>

<li>The (first?) M-Splitter is complete.  The big marbles roll its
entire length, and medium sized marbles fall through.  They do not
yet have a lower track to catch their fall, though, and big marbles
roll immediately off the track instead of around the hairpin turns.</li>
<li>I am beginning to develop character traits for each character, and
have defined some of their unique characteristics, though I have
not settled on names for them.</li>
<li>The small character with white body and green head may become the
primary marble pusher.  He has just released the big marble from
the top of the track and discovered that it rolled right past the
hairpin turn.  Everyone rushed over to see what happened, but the
frames are too quick.  As of this writing, I plan to delete the
last 7 frames and retake them, giving the characters proper time to
react.</li>
<li>Since June 2017, I have spent <a href="https://grun1.com/utils/timeCalc.html?t1=4:14:42&amp;c1=June%202017%204:14:42&amp;t2=10:16:10&amp;c2=July%202017%2010:16:10&amp;t3=26:12:06&amp;c3=Aug%202017%2026:12:06&amp;t4=29:46:54&amp;c4=Sep%202017%2029:46:54&amp;t5=14:55:11&amp;c5=Oct%202017%2014:55:11&amp;t6=29:39:56&amp;c6=Nov%202017%2029:39:56&amp;t7=1:05:07&amp;c7=5%20Dec%202017&amp;t8=55:31&amp;c8=5%20Dec%202017&amp;mode=0&amp;fs3=1&amp;ft2=1&amp;f3t1=1&amp;f4t0=1&amp;d=:&amp;o10=1&amp;fps=">4.8+ days</a> on Marble Track 3.</li>
</ol>

<p>During I-group yesterday, I mentioned Marble Track 3.  Some of the men
asked about it, so I wrote a summary:</p>

<p>TL;DR: this links to a playlist of video clips <a href="https://mt3s.robnugen.com/">https://mt3s.robnugen.com/</a>  (5 clips total)</p>

<p>Latest construction details are here <a href="https://mt3.robnugen.com">https://mt3.robnugen.com</a></p>

<p>Longer story:</p>

<p>Previously, I had created Marble Track 2 and posted a video of it to
Youtube.  The youtube link is available at <a href="https://mt2.robnugen.com">https://mt2.robnugen.com</a>
Many people seemed to like the video and some people asked how I made
the marble track.</p>

<p>After some thought, I realized it would be ridiculous to literally
show people how to make a marble track, and even more
ridiculous/amazing to create a stop motion animation of characters
making a marble track.</p>

<p>So, that is exactly what I am doing while making Marble Track 3.</p>

<p>Each second of video takes roughly an hour behind the scenes taking
photos and moving characters around the set.  I estimate 5 more years
to go on the project.</p>

<p>I am quite happy with at least half of the frames I shot today.
Fortunately, I am happy with the difficult ones!  They were the frames
in which the big marble rolled down the M Splitter and then slammed
against the wall, driving the white pole all the way into the wall.</p>

<p>After the ball hit the floor, I had the other characters react to the
&ldquo;sound&rdquo;, but upon playback, they react too quickly.  The frames of
those characters all moving toward the sound were all pretty easy to
take, so I feel good about re-shooting them.  <del>I estimate it&rsquo;s
about 15</del> I need to delete only 7 frames in all, so just the last
half second at the very end of the video below:</p>

<p>I worked on MT3 in two parts today.  Right around 2 hours total, I
think, not including letting glue dry (during which I ate lunch and
had a nice nap).  I found a pretty good technique for keeping the
large marble in place: using a twist tie looped around the track seems
to do the trick.  If I had taken the time to figure that out before I
had the guy push the big marble up the M Splitter, he would have been
able to walk up on both rails.  As it is, he had one foot down and one
foot up, lodged betwen the rail and the marble to keep it from
rolling.</p>

<p>Now, as of the last frame in the video below, the marble is being kept
in place with a twist tie.  I have marked some graduated lines on
Dragonframe to show how far the marble should move between frames.
Should be pretty easy to do the next frames, and if I can get the
timing right, I will have the marble push the white bar into the back
wall, just as a visual gag and exposition of just how massive the big
marble is.</p>

<p>I finally glued the last piece of the M Splitter.. and it works!
Marbles roll down it faster than I had hoped, so I considered lowering
it.. but there is <em>just</em> enough room for the small marbles to roll
<em>under</em> that track and onto the small marble track which has walls on
it, if I lower one of the walls.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that wall is also the support for the track, so it will
be tricky to cut.  I might have to use the dremel or something..</p>

<p>Oh, so while installing the supports for the M Splitter, the
red-and-white headed character knocked over the ramp.  Then the
character who helped install the ramp fell off the stage where the
ramp had been.</p>
