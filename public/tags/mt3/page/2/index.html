<p>A man named Fust has recommended a new stack for Marble Track 3:
Airtable as backend, Gatsby as frontend, and some other things I have
not heard of.  Actually I had not heard of Gatsby.</p>

<p>I have an old VirtualBox sitting around so I spun it up and loaded a
Gatsby demo.  It pooped out a bunch of deprecation warnings, so I am
loathe to really dig into this thing if it will be an ongoing battle
against a bunch of deprecations ongoing during the project, as well as
making the marble track itself.</p>

<p>I wrote a post on Hugo forums to find a site designer who can make a
nice design for Marble Track 3.  As of this writing, the website uses
my tweak of Castanet, and looks like this
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190111132634/https://www.marbletrack3.com/">Marble Track 3 site v2 (via archive.org)</a></p>

<p>Because the project takes some time to explain, I want the website to
quickly give people an overview, and allow people to click in to get
more details if they like.</p>

<p>One designer replied to my Hugo post.  We had a chat and this is their
first design iteration.
<a href="https://www.deligence.com/clients/marbletrack3/">https://www.deligence.com/clients/marbletrack3/</a>   I made a rough copy
here <a href="https://vigilant-mayer-608cf8.netlify.com/">https://vigilant-mayer-608cf8.netlify.com/</a></p>

<p>One thing Jimmy noted was they used a hexagon motif where circles
would be more appropriate.  I spent a couple hours trying to reverse
engineer SVG paths</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://svghelper.com/">https://svghelper.com/</a> for helping me create this shape</p>

</svg></p>

<p>I sent this response</p>

<pre><code>HI Sanjay

Thank you for the design.

I really like the video embedded in the header graphic, but it seems too dark to me; can it be made somewhat lighter color?

I like that the site is responsive.

Easy changes:

1a) The VIDEO section should be directly below &quot;These guys are great!
Just look at them go!&quot;.  So please swap the order of OUR WORKERS to be
below VIDEO

1b) remove rectangle from around VIDEO section so it will seem
connected to above text &quot;Look at them go!&quot;

2a) In the TRACK (PARTS) section, the Made by sections should not have
a space before the colon (&quot;Made by: &quot; is correct)

2b) In the TRACK (PARTS) section, there should be no space before
commas after workers names (&quot;Dr Sugar, Mr McGlue, Squarehead&quot; is
correct)

3) My friend made a rough logo that can replace the four circles logo.
He will simplify it so it works at a small size

<pre><code>Harder changes

4) Please add a placeholder for the language selection.  There should
be two languages for now: English and Japanese

5) The hexagon theme doesn't make sense with the marbles; can the
theme be round instead of hexagons?  Here are some examples of
unnecessary hexagons, but there are many
more. https://www.deligence.com/clients/marbletrack3/images/hexline_2.png

approximately this shape

&lt;/svg&gt;

6) Anchors in the top right for Twitter, Youtube, Github are too wide.
The anchors overlap so that when mouse cursor is over Twitter anchor,
the Youtube anchor is active.

<pre><code>7) FYI: The current site has no Javascript, so the new site should
still work without javascript.  (no fancy graphics need without
Javascript, but the site should work Web 1.0 if javascript is off)

8) There are many errors in browser console.  Please remove or repair the broken code

9) How do you plan to receive feedback from users?  This site will be
hosted on Netlify.

10) OUR WORKERS section should be dynamically generated so as I add
more workers, they will show up on the top page in OUR WORKERS
section.

best regards
Rob

<pre><code>Dear Rob,


Glad to see you email. I have gone through the website and there
are a lot of improvement which can be done. Please check one of
our Hugo based website - https://www.nathanaherne.com – If you’ll
see on Home page – we have shown important section of the site
briefly and with pictures. Same I’ll propose for this website
i.e. we can show 3 or 6 Workers with Images, 3-6 Tracks, One Step
with picture.


Also, the concept of the site is totally different and unique – we
need to put few lines to let the visitors understand what the site
is all about. We need to create a good logo as well. Regarding
Support/Donations, we need to create multiple ‘Call to Action’s to
take the visitors to the support page.


Do let me know your thoughts on my initial comments and do let me
know if you are available for a video call on 3rd or 4th Jan? My
Skype id is sanjay.deligence



Thanks &amp; Regards,

Sanjay Kumar | CEO

Deligence Technologies - your growing technology partner

<p>My replies, (poorly formatted here on my site):</p>

<pre><code>HI Sanjay

Thank you for your email.  I am glad you looked at the same
carefully enough to know it is a completely unique project.  I
agree with the changes you have suggested so far.

Here are some more sections of the site I would like to be considered:

Episodes
There is one more set of pages you should see as well.  https://www.marbletrack3.com/episode/   This page is hidden from normal visitors.  I would like the design of this page to match the rest of the site, but I do not want the page to be linked from the menus.

Episodes are driven with the file at
https://github.com/marbletracks/marbletrack3.com/blob/master/data/playlists/knownvideos.toml
This file is updated with calls to Youtube API, driven by this
script https://github.com/marbletracks/go-get-video-durations

I am very happy with the way this all works.  I only want to
redesign the /episodes page to match the rest of the site.

Parts / Workers Did you see how these pages are linked between
Workers and Tracks?  For example,
https://www.marbletrack3.com/parts/caret_splitter_feeder_extension/
source code includes an array of Workers that worked on the track.
There will be many many more tracks to come, and I eventually need
a way to allow human fans/supporters of the project to suggest
names of parts.

Thanks There will eventually be many more pages available under
https://www.marbletrack3.com/thanks/ There are no pictures of
people here yet, but this section is to thank the people who have
helped me with the track.  The Sweets Party Attendants have helped
me with translations.  Two more people have helped financially,
but I do not have images / permission to show them on the site.  I
would like a page under /thanks/ to be for this general support.

Steps Under &quot;Step by Step&quot; https://www.marbletrack3.com/snippets/
my idea is not nearly finished.  If you click the first Step you
see this page,
https://www.marbletrack3.com/snippets/0010_setting_the_stage/ The
Step is a detailed description of the first video snippet in this
playlist
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KjsYc4Mb5g&amp;list=PL0osPGt21FB48UwuhtCUoi9JndC9YDHAZ

In order to drive this part of the site, I want to create a data
file similar to

I have sketched out a file at
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://github.com/marbletracks/marbletrack3.com/blob/master/static/track_listing.txt">https://github.com/marbletracks/marbletrack3.com/blob/master/static/track_listing.txt</a></p>

<pre><code>but I have not written a way to parse it nor easily populate it.
There is no way to automatically create this data file, so I need to
have a reliable way to manually add new sections to it.

I would like for each written Step to be linked to the
corresponding second of output video.

This line

0:32 &quot;candy_mama&quot; | Snake Plate Chopstick for now, will create
text on the site for Snake Plate Chopstick and link it to second
32 of the correct video https://youtu.be/2bP7Irt5hHc?t=32

I imagine this is a mini-project of its own, so I do not mind if
we do not work on it.  But I am open to questions, ideas, and
suggestions for it.

In General For this project

I would like all work to be done in the open with Pull Requests on
Github.  I want all changes to work with my current workflow: when
I git push changes to the site, they appear on the live site via
Netlify.  I understand you do not have access to my Netlify
account.  But I hope once I merge a pull request, it will work
that way.  We can start with small changes to make sure it works
in a way that is good for both of us.

blessings
- Rob

<p>A few minutes later</p>

<pre><code>HI Sanjay

I have just realized I sent my email before speaking about
https://www.nathanaherne.com/

You said &quot;we have shown important section of the site briefly and with
pictures.&quot;  Instead of pictures, I want to use video clips like the
ones I have at the bottom of my existing
site. https://b.robnugen.com/art/marble_track_3/workers/snippets/quick_look_francois_installs_stage.mp4

The overall idea on Nathan's site is good, but Marble Track 3 site
must focus on the workers and not focus on me as doing the work.  I
will be semi-hidden from the project, only visible on /episodes and
git repository.


thank you
Rob

<p>Though I have not figured out how to present it, I want to have some
pages that give a complete rundown of how the workers have made Marble
Track 3.</p>

<p>At this point, under /snippets, it starts like this:</p>

<pre><code>Squarehead leads Rabby onto the set as Rabby drags a round
circular plate behind him.

Squarehead unties the ropes from Rabby. Rabby squishes Squarehead as
he heads toward the camera, knocking it off its stand.

By the time the camera is reset, Squarehead has recovered and is
pulling the ropes out from under the wooden circle.

Lil brother comes onto the set, and wonders if he’s allowed to step on
the stage. He sees his mom, and thinks better of it. Other characters
pay the stage no mind and walk all across it.

Once the characters have arrived and greeted each other, Dr Sugar
comes in and thanks everyone for being there.

Mr McGlue comes in late, and big brother tells Lil brother to wait his
turn. Big brother punches Lil brother and runs away.

Then everyone except Candy Mama and Dr Sugar run away as spooky
skeleton Garinoppi comes onto the set. Lil Brother inexplicably floats
up into the air.
</code></pre>

<p>I want the moments to be linked to specific timestamps in specific
videos online (currently, Youtube).  I also want photos of the
moments, embedded in the text.</p>

<p>I think the best way to do this will be with a data document that Hugo
can parse.  I will have to maintain the data file by hand for the
foreseeable future; I don&rsquo;t know of any other way to get the data.</p>

<p>Super nice: I was able to figure out how to create a function to
simplify the creation of web pages for Marble Track 3
Parts](<a href="https://www.marbletrack3.com/parts/">https://www.marbletrack3.com/parts/</a>).  Now I just type <code>C-c p</code>
in Emacs, then enter the title, tags, and shortcode to produce a file
for a new Part in the Marble Track 3 website.</p>

<p>Today, with said shortcode, I started the page for
<a href="/p/mcbts">Medium Catcher Below Triple Splitter</a>.</p>

<p>Just finished four lessons at SCC: Naoko, Liliko, Hitomi, and Yasu
each had 30 minute lessons, practicing various parts of their
presentations.</p>

<p>During the first two lessons, my nose was running like yuck.  I used a
bunch of toilet paper and tissues blowing all the snot out.</p>

<p>This morning I worked on MT3 for 1.5 hours or so, getting maybe 8
frames taken.  At this point, I am working on version 2 of the
website, which focuses on the characters making the track instead of
me making the characters make the track.</p>

<p>Men&rsquo;s group at 10:30 featured 10 or 11 men, a relatively big group.  I
had a great cry during which I realized I feel tons of shame and
sadness about how much I have <em>not</em> accomplished in Japan.  I should
be making a good living, but I am still paycheck to paycheck and it
sucks.  That is the main reason I cannot go back to US every year.</p>

<p>In other news:</p>

<ul>
<li>I will go on Monday to replace <em>both</em> fans and the battery in this
computer (MacBook Pro, 2012)</li>
<li>I have gotten more than half of the classes in AB websites to be
autoloaded per <a href="https://leanpub.com/mlaphp">MLAPHP</a></li>
<li>Will meet Tariq tomorrow to finalize(?) the specs/screens for
version 1 of ConSwi</li>
<li>In the middle of training at TY, helping Jay with that.</li>
<li>Great workshop presentation by Dora yesterday, and am inspired to do
the same myself, but $3000?  See the above-mentioned
paycheck-to-paycheck comment.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have been working on a new version of Marble Track 3 website for a
few days..  The new version completely hides the livestreams and just
focuses on the workers, the track pieces they make, and people who
helped with the project.</p>

<p>There are a few rough spots, but it will likely be up within a week.</p>

<p>Mark rode 4km from the 古民家公園 to our house yesterday to meet Lin
and see Marble Track 3 in person.  He had some great ideas for MT3:</p>

<ul>
<li>Encourage teambuilding among youth by giving them a certain set of
track pieces, tools, and time limit to make a track that fits a
certain set of requirements.</li>
<li>Set my camera so the whole set is in focus.</li>
<li>Add narration or speech bubbles to explain the story in more detail.</li>
</ul>

<p>Dang marbletrack3.com is broken now.  Netlify created the SSL cert and
neither of my browsers like it.</p>
