      <description>13:55 Tuesday 03 September 2019 JST Jimmy messaged me on youtube near the end of my nearly 3 hour livestream. During the livestream I got about 2 seconds of video taken, during which Reversible Guy installed the Caret Splitter Feeder Extension Reflection Protection. They work quite well!</description>

      <description>13:16 Thursday 13 June 2019 JST Today I glued just one piece (twice) in an attempt to move Marble Track 3 forward. The piece is a small segment of the pointy end of a toothpick which will support the upper end of Lower Zig Zag 3ban.</description>

      <description>20:18 Thursday 09 May 2019 JST Today I showed students in Akihabara the website and snippets for Marble Track 3. They were like &amp;ldquo;waow&amp;rdquo; etc. I love the project and felt a bit guilty for taking up a significant amount of class time with it. We have had lessons for years though, so I don&amp;rsquo;t think they will mind.</description>

      <description>08:09 Tuesday 07 May 2019 JST Now that I will not likely add any more shortlinks to Marble Track 3 website, I have been expanding them in the markdown, which will save a redirect each time people click on the links.</description>

      <description>08:57 Monday 06 May 2019 JST Atom editor has a way to write my own autocomplete rules. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a link handy, but it is handy for making links.
So I have a two part approach:
 create a file with Emacs by entering a Title (part name), Shortcode, Image, Tag(s), and date. Emacs creates the new file as part_name.md and now appends to the Atom file ~/.atom/snippets.cson the information necessary to let Atom auto complete the markdown after I type the shortcode.</description>

      <description>23:56 Tuesday 30 April 2019 JST At Mark&amp;rsquo;s suggestion, Michael and I ate at a restaurant in Noborito where we talked about Marble Track 3. I showed him the secret backend of Marble Track 3 where I have &amp;ldquo;episodes&amp;rdquo; showing the 300+ hours of livestreams for creating the animation of the construction..</description>

      <description>08:19 Sunday 28 April 2019 JST Near the end of my Marble Track 3 Construction Animation livestream for today, I got a well meaning comment from the gloriously named FE4R Fart1oncheese:

      <description>Ask HN: What is your money-making side project outside programming?
My reply, copied below:
TL;DR: not making money yet, but enjoying stop motion animation of marble track construction.
Back in the day, my brother and I would use Legos to build tracks for marbles, using roof pieces as ramps. Eventually I started making marble tracks out of popsicle sticks. Over a period of some years, I built a track 2+ feet (70cm) tall with lots of tracks intertwining each other all the way down.</description>

      <description>07:35 Thursday 21 February 2019 JST Marble Track 3 is not my #1 priority; I am happy to work on it slowly.
*) Rewriting in Gatsby / React makes sense if I can learn along the path to creating it. How do you feel about going slowly, to help an old newbie learn along the way?
Basically, I do the work, learning along the way, you get a per month retainer, for minimum 5 months?</description>

      <description>20:17 Thursday 14 February 2019 JST A man named Fust has recommended a new stack for Marble Track 3: Airtable as backend, Gatsby as frontend, and some other things I have not heard of. Actually I had not heard of Gatsby.
I have an old VirtualBox sitting around so I spun it up and loaded a Gatsby demo. It pooped out a bunch of deprecation warnings, so I am loathe to really dig into this thing if it will be an ongoing battle against a bunch of deprecations ongoing during the project, as well as making the marble track itself.</description>

      <description>22:28 Friday 11 January 2019 JST I wrote a post on Hugo forums to find a site designer who can make a nice design for Marble Track 3. As of this writing, the website uses my tweak of Castanet, and looks like this Marble Track 3 site v2 (via archive.org)
Because the project takes some time to explain, I want the website to quickly give people an overview, and allow people to click in to get more details if they like.</description>

      <description>21:14 Sunday 30 December 2018 JST Dear Rob, Glad to see you email. I have gone through the website and there are a lot of improvement which can be done. Please check one of our Hugo based website - https://www.nathanaherne.com – If you’ll see on Home page – we have shown important section of the site briefly and with pictures. Same I’ll propose for this website i.e. we can show 3 or 6 Workers with Images, 3-6 Tracks, One Step with picture.</description>

      <description>20:59 Thursday 20 December 2018 JST Though I have not figured out how to present it, I want to have some pages that give a complete rundown of how the workers have made Marble Track 3.
At this point, under /snippets, it starts like this:
Squarehead leads Rabby onto the set as Rabby drags a round circular plate behind him. Squarehead unties the ropes from Rabby. Rabby squishes Squarehead as he heads toward the camera, knocking it off its stand.</description>

      <description>20:28 Thursday 20 December 2018 JST Super nice: I was able to figure out how to create a function to simplify the creation of web pages for Marble Track 3 Parts](https://www.marbletrack3.com/parts/). Now I just type C-c p in Emacs, then enter the title, tags, and shortcode to produce a file for a new Part in the Marble Track 3 website.
Today, with said shortcode, I started the page for Medium Catcher Below Triple Splitter.</description>

      <description>17:24 Thursday 29 November 2018 JST Just finished four lessons at SCC: Naoko, Liliko, Hitomi, and Yasu each had 30 minute lessons, practicing various parts of their presentations.
During the first two lessons, my nose was running like yuck. I used a bunch of toilet paper and tissues blowing all the snot out.
This morning I worked on MT3 for 1.5 hours or so, getting maybe 8 frames taken. At this point, I am working on version 2 of the website, which focuses on the characters making the track instead of me making the characters make the track.</description>

      <description>15:29 Friday 16 November 2018 JST I have been working on a new version of Marble Track 3 website for a few days.. The new version completely hides the livestreams and just focuses on the workers, the track pieces they make, and people who helped with the project.
There are a few rough spots, but it will likely be up within a week.</description>

      <description>06:11 Monday 12 November 2018 JST Mark rode 4km from the 古民家公園 to our house yesterday to meet Lin and see Marble Track 3 in person. He had some great ideas for MT3:
 Encourage teambuilding among youth by giving them a certain set of track pieces, tools, and time limit to make a track that fits a certain set of requirements. Set my camera so the whole set is in focus.</description>

      <description>15:38 Monday 15 October 2018 JST Dang marbletrack3.com is broken now. Netlify created the SSL cert and neither of my browsers like it.
I will switch back to hosting on Dreamhost if Netlify cannot sort it out.

I have created a support ticket with Netlify.
And to think I was about ready to shift all my static sites over.</description>

      <description>In this livestream, I added 1 second of video to the 6th snippet.
In the background, the reversible guy has just gotten the bridge cut and is about to place it when he (and I, ahem) realized it was flipped around the wrong way.
In the foreground, the snake began climbing up the ramp to the triple ball splitter while the manager tries to work out how to get the small ball to fall at the right place.</description>

      <description>12:58 Saturday 14 July 2018 JST Working on MT3 today I had a funny idea. There were two marbles ready to roll off the track and I realized it would be great for the spoonhead guy to catch them. So I had to erase eight frames, but they were not too hard to recreate, and the end result is great.
  The frames are shown in the last second of the video above.</description>

      <description>13:53 Sunday 24 June 2018 JST Added about 3 seconds worth of frames, so about 36 frames today. Pretty good! One of the snakes has finished his first task and is now snaking around to meet up with his friend who will soon be able to snake around. Not sure if I will have them leave&amp;hellip; oh, maybe they should curl up and wait somewhere.
Pinky fell off the stage and hit the switch, so the stage is rotating again.</description>

      <description>12:55 Friday 15 June 2018 JST よいしょ is the audio I want to add right at the end of this video. In this case, it is the equivalent of &amp;ldquo;3. 2. 1. lift!&amp;rdquo;
Spoonhead is adept at getting the marbles onto the stage because he&amp;rsquo;s the right height for that. I gave him long arms as well to help lift marbles (and knock the switch around accidentally).
  Speaking of accidents, while trying to film the frame after they lifted the marble, it fell and knocked everything askew.</description>

      <description>08:20 Saturday 09 June 2018 JST １０年前二番目のビーだせんは六ヶ月で作りました。　Ten years ago, I made Marble Track 2 in 6 months.
いじめる人が「六ヶ月は無駄でした」だって。　Trolls said I wasted 6 months.
ファンの人が「すごい！どうやって作った？」だって。 Fans asked how I made it.
だから、去年新しいビー玉線路「三番目ビーだせん」を作り始めました。 Therefore, last year I started a new marble track, Marble Track 3.
予定は毎週二時間以上「三番目ビーだせん」を作ります。 The plan is to work on it at least 2 hours per week.
今も作ろうと思ったんだけど日本語の宿題も大切です。I was going to work on it now, but I should also write Japanese.</description>

It all started 10+ years ago when I showed Marble Track 2 to the world. https://mt2.robnugen.com/ As you can see in the comments, trolls were like &amp;ldquo;you wasted 6 months of your life!</description>

      <description> 05:15 Wednesday 30 May 2018 JST I spent a couple hours on MT3 yesterday, culminating in introducing a new character whose job is to carry marbles onto the stage. On his way out, he hit the switch to reverse the stage rotation, so Squarehead will fall because he is just about to jump off the stage onto the ramp, but the stage is just about to reverse direction.

      <description>15:58 Monday 28 May 2018 JST HI Jackie! I would like to make a site for my ongoing project, Marble Track 3. I need some help kinda imagining how is best to present the info+content I have, plus I have a few ideas+constraints of how I think it should go. I think the site can be implemented as a static website with no backend coding required. (Except *possibly* for a section inviting people to get involved with the project.</description>

      <description>19:15 Sunday 13 May 2018 JST Hahaha I am really entertained by this next portion of the video. Didn&amp;rsquo;t even really see it coming until just the other day when I needed a way to hold up a rail while it gets glued into place.
  Since June 2017, I have spent 7.5+ days on Marble Track 3.
The resulting video snippets, available via https://mt3s.robnugen.com/, total approximately 9 minutes 39 seconds.</description>

      <description>11:57 Wednesday 09 May 2018 JST Hey Nathan I am making a marble track, a.k.a. rolling ball track, similar to this one I made several years ago, visible here https://mt2.robnugen.com/ This time, however, I am not just making the track, I am also making a stop action animation of some characters making the track. Clips of the video so far are here https://mt3s.robnugen.com in a playlist. (No audio nor background yet; that is a whole other project (I asked you about Blender before)) The project is about 5% finished, and has taken a year to get this far.</description>

      <description>10:25 Wednesday 09 May 2018 JST I am in the middle of making the marble splitter work for small marbles.
The manager has just glued one rail into place and will glue the inner rail next.
Next, the manager will:
 glue inner rail for small track test the too small marble (which will fail) eject too small marble test a correctly-sized small marble  At the same time, Reversable Guy (RG) will place the other splitter top rail.</description>

      <description>09:05 Wednesday 02 May 2018 JST Yesterday I glued a piece onto the track which was designed to catch small marbles as they fall through the not parallel bamboo chopstick marble splitter.
Now it&amp;rsquo;s time to see if it worked!
Woohoooo it worked!!
     
09:18 Wednesday 02 May 2018 JST Uh oh.
After I tested the fix today, while setting up for the next frame, I noticed the large marbles could not roll past the piece.</description>

Great progress on MT3 today. I shaved the bottom of the marble splitter chopsticks so the small marble could pass under them. I made a bit of a continuity mistake though by actually lifting one of the chopsticks a bit (instead of just shaving the bottom of it).
These are pics from before the shave:</description>

      <description>17:35 Friday 27 April 2018 JST Just smiling after watching the latest snippet for Marble Track 3 construction. It&amp;rsquo;s the one called &amp;ldquo;Brotherly Spat&amp;rdquo; on YouTube. In it, the brothers get into a fight, which they had done a little bit in the first video, but this time, it&amp;rsquo;s on, as they said on Southpark, and the brothers&amp;rsquo; fight is meant to look like a cartoon dust cloud with random feet and other extremities poking out of the cloud as it hovers in mid air.</description>

      <description>09:58 Wednesday 04 April 2018 JST I added lots of frames yesterday to Marble Track 3 video. There was a long section with just 2 or 3, or even just 1 character moving at a time. I added 20 seconds to the video, which destroys any previous day expect maybe the first couple days when I just had the manager walking around.
I did not exactly predict the current situation; I just knew the chopstick poking off the edge of the track should do something.</description>

 he little brother has just start to walk near the ramps; I do not know where he will go next, but probably off the scene to go look for something fun to do. The reversible guy about to go back to the switch to make the stage rotate toward the right again. Candy cane mom has to figure out what track to build next.</description>

      <description>15:41 Thursday 29 March 2018 JST I worked for 90 minutes today and nearly 60 minutes the other day (but did not put up a new video then). The latest:
  While the Reversable Guy went to see what happened, the little brother grabbed onto the chopstick which had kept the stage from rotating properly. Before crashing into the ramps, he jumped off; he is fine.
Soon RG will go back to the switch and perhaps find the ramp knocked over, or maybe the ramp will turn the switch on full blast which could be fun.</description>

Meanwhile, Candycane Mom has just put the dual track rail in place down at another ball split point. It will hold medium-sized and small-sized marbles.</description>

      <description>15:22 Tuesday 20 March 2018 JST (written 09:25 Wednesday 21 March 2018 JST)
In a single day, I can take maybe 20 or 30 frames, which adds a couple of seconds to the final movie.
Yesterday, I worked 2 hours on Marble Track 3, including adding a new dimension of planning to the project:
  
I wrote notes to script out the next 5 weeks (or so) for the Reversable Guy (character whose head looks largely the same when facing forward or backward) as he debugs why the stage is slowing down.</description>

      <description>16:40 Sunday 18 March 2018 JST An interesting thing is happening with the stage rotation. Last week I noticed a chopstick was sticking out too far for the stage to turn all the way around, and this time it has hit the wall and begun to hamper the rotation of the stage.
  I think the cutter guy might cut the offending chopstick and have the stage spring forward, which I may do in slow motion again, like when the manager got yanked by the spinning bearing while they tried to wrangle it.</description>

      <description>11:27 Tuesday 20 February 2018 JST I had previously thought of having the little brother come running up to see what all the fuss was about, and knock everyone off the stage. But I have done that once, and it wastes a bunch of time, and the timing didn&amp;rsquo;t work out anyway.
So in the end, the characters who were looking for him all turn around one by one. Candycane mom will put her hands on her hips after she fully turns around.</description>

      <description>13:52 Tuesday 06 February 2018 JST I got a couple seconds of easy filming done today during which I debated for a bit if I should have people get worried about little brother. Ultimately decided yes, and I&amp;rsquo;m quite happy with the results so far! The guy with green head is now helping big brother look for little brother. Candy Cane has finished coming up the ramp with a load of five popsicle sticks.</description>

      <description>10:54 Tuesday 30 January 2018 JST Recorded 2 seconds of video today, including having the little brother spin around and fall off the top end of the track splitter. The big brother started to run down to the area to look for his little brother but he won&amp;rsquo;t find him&amp;hellip; I have decided to have the little brother crawl out from between the stages in about 6 movie-seconds from now, which may be in 2 months from now?</description>

      <description>21:53 Sunday 28 January 2018 JST I spent nearly 3 hours on Marble Track 3 today, but over an hour of it was trying to figure out how to make Blackmagic Fusion import multiple sequences of images to put them into one movie.
I was not able to figure it out.
  I have a sneaking suspicion that BM Fusion is not designed to do this. Most of its output options were images, so.</description>

      <description>15:55 Friday 19 January 2018 JST This clip includes 1066 frames. I didn&amp;rsquo;t upload clips the past 2 or 3 times I worked on the track because it took a long time to add the first three ribs to the edge of the largest marble&amp;rsquo;s track.
Now I am in the process of getting some characters off the set because they are just じゃま and wasting time during filming. I already have the brothers wasting enough time, plus the guy in the back trying to make his way around the currently-highest point of the largest marble&amp;rsquo;s track.</description>

      <description>15:59 Tuesday 09 January 2018 JST I have worked on MT3 a few times since getting back. A couple days ago, progress was super slow and I did not even export a video clip, much less upload one. Today I got much further, after having figured out a way to lift the bridge, and then I had the green cutter guy make some curved toothpicks which will be used for rail supports to keep the large marbles on track during the 2nd to last U-turn.</description>

      <description>10:32 Thursday 14 December 2017 JST &amp;lsquo;far as I can tell, I have not yet documented how I back up Marble Track 3 data.
boto-rsync --endpoint objects-us-west-1.dream.io . s3://mt3/mt3  But to be clear, I have not confirmed the restore functionality!
I guess it would be
boto-rsync --endpoint objects-us-west-1.dream.io s3://mt3/mt3 .  but are there keys required? Let&amp;rsquo;s just check.

      <description>09:51 Tuesday 12 December 2017 JST I added a record 7 seconds of video in just 2 hours. Part of that was certainly due to fewer disparate things going on, not the least of which being that the stage was stopped from turning!
At this point:
 the cutter is just about to cut the excess support off the ramp base, after which the gluer will lift the base and glue the pieces to it.</description>

      <description>09:05 Saturday 09 December 2017 JST  The (first?) M-Splitter is complete. The big marbles roll its entire length, and medium sized marbles fall through. They do not yet have a lower track to catch their fall, though, and big marbles roll immediately off the track instead of around the hairpin turns. I am beginning to develop character traits for each character, and have defined some of their unique characteristics, though I have not settled on names for them.</description>

      <description>20:56 Thursday 07 December 2017 JST I am quite happy with at least half of the frames I shot today. Fortunately, I am happy with the difficult ones! They were the frames in which the big marble rolled down the M Splitter and then slammed against the wall, driving the white pole all the way into the wall.
After the ball hit the floor, I had the other characters react to the &amp;ldquo;sound&amp;rdquo;, but upon playback, they react too quickly.</description>

      <description>13:46 Tuesday 05 December 2017 JST I worked on MT3 in two parts today. Right around 2 hours total, I think, not including letting glue dry (during which I ate lunch and had a nice nap). I found a pretty good technique for keeping the large marble in place: using a twist tie looped around the track seems to do the trick. If I had taken the time to figure that out before I had the guy push the big marble up the M Splitter, he would have been able to walk up on both rails.</description>

      <description>15:39 Wednesday 29 November 2017 JST I finally glued the last piece of the M Splitter.. and it works! Marbles roll down it faster than I had hoped, so I considered lowering it.. but there is just enough room for the small marbles to roll under that track and onto the small marble track which has walls on it, if I lower one of the walls.
Unfortunately, that wall is also the support for the track, so it will be tricky to cut.</description>

      <description>12:07 Saturday 25 November 2017 JST Only one hour so far today on Marble Track 3.
 
The images above show the track before and after having glued the second support on the first half of what I am calling the M Dropper or M Splitter. It will split the medium sized marbles off the large marble track by being too wide for the medium sized marbles to touch both sides of the track.</description>

      <description>14:17 Friday 24 November 2017 JST Today I glued the first half of the track which will separate the medium sized marbles from the large marbles. I am reasonably sure I can get it to work without too much undo/redo, but it has taken some time to get it to look like the characters put it all in place.
One slight mistake: I need to cut the end of the sticks because they stick out beyond the edge of the circle.</description>

      <description>08:37 Friday 24 November 2017 JST I just uploaded the video that I took yesterday. At this moment, the vertical bar is cut, but I have not taken the photo for that cut. The green guy has swiped his sword, and I cut the bar, but.. let&amp;rsquo;s just say they are not poised for the shot.
 
  Since June 2017, I have spent 4.444 4.4+ days so far on Marble Track 3.</description>

      <description>13:01 Tuesday 21 November 2017 JST I added about 2 seconds of footage today in 1.5 hours. Fast because a lot of it was just moving some characters around. Slow because Jennie came to sit in my lap for a bit. (I have come to accept the idea of letting her walk onto the scene; I will just take pictures of her entry&amp;hellip; but she chose not to walk on the desk.</description>

      <description>15:00 Saturday 18 November 2017 JST During the livestream today, I watched the (5) clips so far to see which characters have had the ability to pass through tracks. Basically it&amp;rsquo;s easier to let characters pass through tracks, but I think it would be a good subtle thing if some characters (consistently) can, and some (consistently) cannot.
Anyway, I took notes and pinned them to the blue fabric which makes the floor of the set.</description>

      <description>14:08 Tuesday 14 November 2017 JST Funny to put it that way, but yeah today about 30 minutes per glued piece, if I recall correctly. I went to bed early last night and woke up early to get started on MT3.
Right now I am on the train so don&amp;rsquo;t have the clip ID handy.. oh but Chrome remembered it.
  And here is the livestream https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3jQqWMIZFA
I am optimistic that the pieces I glued in place will prove to have been glued in correct enough places to stay put.</description>

      <description>21:13 Sunday 22 October 2017 JST I glued the first curved piece which will turn the largest marbles nearly 180 degrees.. perhaps 170.. I am not yet sure if the track will work, which kinda spooks me. In Marble Track 3, if the characters glue everything before I glue it, I won&amp;rsquo;t easily be able to test a portion of track that seems like it needs testing. aka once I glue it without testing, it will take double extra time to refilm them putting the piece in place.</description>

      <description>15:43 Friday 20 October 2017 JST I bought an AC adapter to use with my camera. Today I had been able to use the battery for about 90 minutes before it conked out. The adapter was 2000 yen from Amazon, but between 6000 and 8000 yen at Bic Camera and Yodobashi Camera. How will this play out in the long term? Bic Camera connect with Amazon Buy Now inside their store?</description>

Live stream in two parts today.
 Up to the first roll https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjtpiRxoxvU The first roll https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9gCFg5TpqQ  I have spent 73 hours on MT3 so far.
10:23 Wednesday 11 October 2017 JST Oh wow I really love it. The characters manically run around for a bit and it&amp;rsquo;s hard to tell what&amp;rsquo;s going on, but then they all line up for the first roll; I think it looks pretty good.</description>

      <description>21:43 Saturday 23 September 2017 JST It isn&amp;rsquo;t as smooth as I&amp;rsquo;d like, but the moment Francois kicks the stage represents about 1 hour of time spent during which I attached the upper stage to the lower stage. Connecting the upper stage was challenging enough for me, so it would have taken a silly amount of time to create footage of the pipe cleaner guys doing it.
  Here are today&amp;rsquo;s livestreams:</description>

      <description>16:04 Thursday 14 September 2017 JST I livestreamed for just about an hour today, and added a gag related to the direction of motion. Standing on opposite sides of the circle, the direction of rotation was miscommunicated between two characters.

      <description>11:58 Tuesday 12 September 2017 JST It was a bit challenging to use the screwdriver and drillbit which are pretty heavy compared to the pipe cleaners, but I was able to get the first hole drilled, and I think I have a good system to drill the other holes in just the right places. I have glued the drillbit holder (yellow and green pipe cleaner guy) to the top of the bearing in such a way that he will hold the drillbit in the right spot for each hole simply by rotating the bearing.</description>

      <description>18:35 Monday 11 September 2017 JST   Because I needed to get the bearing aligned, I did a little trope of the scratching fingernails variety as one of the characters simply pulled the bearing into place. He was not one of the characters who tried to wrangle it, but the sorta-joke is that apparently he could have done it without all the trouble of making it float, etc.</description>

I added lights, blue background which work well enough for my first project.
Bought a pretty good camera and stand (because the stand I tried to make was too flimsy).

Using thread, I suspended a bearing plate from a broom over my set. I did not have a good way to adjust the length of the thread, so I used several layers of thick cloth (socks) on one side of the broom to allow the plate to descend toward the stage.</description>

      <description>05:12 Friday 11 August 2017 JST While preparing for my next scene, I realize I want to add a blur effect, so I introduced myself on stopmotionanimation.com because
I just came to the most technically difficult part of my movie: flying a helicopter (flat bearing thing) into the scene. I have an idea for how to rig it up with thread to simulate flight, but I want to add an effect of motion blur on the blades of my helicopter (flat bearing thing).</description>

      <description>13:53 Friday 04 August 2017 JST I tried getting Cyberduck to talk to Amazon S3, but could not do it as easily as I was able to get it to talk to Dream Objects S3.
Last time I used duplicity, I included GPG in the mix, so the files are encrypted. I apparently did not put the key in a safe place so they are effectively bricked.
This time, no GPG, and I have set the files to be public (but I do not know where / how people can access them).</description>

      <description>10:51 Friday 07 July 2017 JST Nice.
It came with some little cards that can be used to focus, and some pages that can be used to plan scenes.. maybe I will sketch some out now.
08:11 Saturday 08 July 2017 JST Yesterday I ended up with about 80 frames of completed video.
  I might redo them from a different camera angle, but that would mean (starting over and) making a new shelf (or something) to hold the camera.</description>

It will replace the male-to-male and female-to-female (and tiny male-to-female) extension monstrosity that I bought in Akihabara last week or so. Hopefully this will sort out the issues I had with sound in previous video.</description>

I wonder if I&amp;rsquo;ll do my crazy time-consuming version or just make a normal version.
Because we have a cat, I&amp;rsquo;m starting by creating a shelter for the track.

      <description>09:33 Saturday 18 May 2013 I&amp;rsquo;ve finished a minute and 21 seconds worth of Marble Track 3 video.
There&amp;rsquo;s exactly one piece that crosses over another track. In the image below, the pink character is standing on that piece which is marked with black.

The other pieces marked in black are the continuation of that track, which ends in the lower middle of MT3. (hmm I&amp;rsquo;m using the word &amp;ldquo;track&amp;rdquo; to describe a single track and &amp;ldquo;track&amp;rdquo; to describe the entire thing.</description>

I had been using Cyberduck, but it has to update the entire huge file each time so takes too long and cannot recover from network errors.
I found and even installed expandrive but it&amp;rsquo;s not free, so I kept looking
I looked at boar which would probably do just fine, but I did a couple more searches
I found git-bigfiles which would probably also do fine,</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve finished 56 seconds so far of Marble Track 3. The white and pink characters are gluing the 180 degree turn in the second corner (of four corners). I&amp;rsquo;ve got plans in mind for the two center tracks.. hmm maybe I can scribble a bit on a photo. brb.

Okay so in the lower right corner, the white and pink guys are placing pieces for the second of four 180 degree turns in each corner.</description>

Worked on Marble Track 3 some more today. This time the green cutter guy cut four ice cream spoons, the pieces of which were distributed to the four corners of the track. I&amp;rsquo;ve started gluing pieces at one of the corners. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably place some pieces on the two tracks that end along the center line of the track.</description>

The first time I started Marble Track 3, I was living in Motosumiyoshi. I worked on it for a few months, iirc, before losing my job and moving to Soness&amp;rsquo;s living room floor for two years. The track was shelved and never finished, though I did work on it a bit once Lin and I moved to Kawasaki, but then part of it was broken and it got shelved again when I started working on iPhone apps with Tariq.</description>

Okay so it all started ten years ago. I made Marble Track 2 during my free time at work and then made this video.
  People asked how I made the marble track. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple question without a simple answer. &amp;ldquo;I glued sticks together..&amp;rdquo;
I decided I should answer by showing the pipe cleaner characters making the track.</description>
