      <description>00:03 Friday 21 June 2019 JST JB got me 8 hours of lessons at BP over the 4 Thursdays in June. This was the 3rd lesson, during which we practiced taking taxis, ordering in a restaurant, and something else.
Yoko M wasn&amp;rsquo;t there, but she will be back next week. Yoko N volunteered a couple of times to go first!</description>
