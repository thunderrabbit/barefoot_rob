I just wrote 2 letters. To Christy and Erika. I just got one from Lila. You know what? Lila is awesome! I love her personality and she&#39;s into guys and sex and she gives good back massages... Wow! And I&#39;m gonna get her at OKC. I can&#39;t believe she&#39;s 15 though. I would swear she&#39;s older than me. goodnight. 10:28</description>
