      <description>21:48 Tuesday 07 April 2015 JST Good lesson with Mutsumi; her English is certainly improving, though she doesn&amp;rsquo;t see it! We&amp;rsquo;ve been working on past perfect / past continuous / present continuous.
Her husband joined us near the end of the lesson and gave me a cool navy/dark gray/olive camouflage suit jacket! wow! It&amp;rsquo;s barely too small for me, but definitely wearable!</description>

Mutsumi invited Lin and I to eat with her and hubby and nephew and friends Bruno and Sachiko at a Taiwanese restaurant near their house. I was enthralled as Lin spoke Mandarin with the proprietor for a bit. So cool!
I was inspired to learn Japanese a bit more than before.
