      <description>02:02 Sunday 17 January 2016 JST Mark, Sumiyaki, Esther, and I attended ET contact night. I had had great optimism, but so far it hasn&amp;rsquo;t panned out. We were outside in the progressively colder and colder air from 21:30 to 01:30, mostly looking up at clouds until the very end after we said we were gonna go and it unclouded to only 51% cover. huh.
We stayed a bit longer, but are now inside.</description>
