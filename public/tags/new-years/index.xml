      <description>13:27 Monday 08 January 2018 JST Today is the last day of winter holiday for me. Lin and I have been back home for a week, during which I have mostly worked on Godot, read The Power of Now, watched movies with Lin, and worked a bit on MT3.
This past Saturday, we went to see her family for Happy New Year, and I have been chatting with her niece in English on LINE since then.</description>

It was my first time to go to a temple for New Years in Japan. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t as crowded as I expected, though there was a pretty long line of people queued up to pray(?). There was a bit of a mob near the bell that emanated some great reverberations each time a group went up to ring it. I was like, &amp;ldquo;I wanna ring it!</description>

This is the last day of the nineteens!!!!!!
 There&#39;s the whole debate about, &#34;well, it&#39;s not really the millenium or even the century cause way back in the day they started counting with 1 not 0 blahdiddyblah.&#34; Yes, I say, but realistically, what is *cool* is seeing those 000 zeros roll up onto the calendar. I mean, driving in the car people don&#39;t say oh look!</description>
