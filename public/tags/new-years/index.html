<p>Today is the last day of winter holiday for me.  Lin and I have been
back home for a week, during which I have mostly worked on Godot, read
<em>The Power of Now</em>, watched movies with Lin, and worked a bit on MT3.</p>

<p>This past Saturday, we went to see her family for Happy New Year, and
I have been chatting with her niece in English on LINE since then.</p>

<p>We watched The Last Jedi (Star Wars episode 8) last night in the
theater (Lin slept a little) and then The Phantom Menace (episode 1)
at home via Amazon (199 yen rental for 48 hours) (I slept a little and
Lin slept a lot).</p>

<p>Oh, and this is the time that Meltdown and Spectre are making the
news.  Intel stock is down a bit, but probably not for long.</p>

<p>It was my first time to go to a temple for New Years in Japan.  It
wasn&rsquo;t as crowded as I expected, though there was a pretty long line
of people queued up to pray(?).  There was a bit of a mob near the
bell that emanated some great reverberations each time a group went up
to ring it.  I was like, &ldquo;I wanna ring it!&rdquo; but turns out we&rsquo;d have to
reserve a spot in advance.</p>

<p>Seo and Mika gave us a bunch of mikans.  So delicious!</p>

<p>After we finished walking around the temple, it was about 12:45am, so
the Ikegami line was no longer running.  Mike and Seo walked home (not
too far), while Lin and I walked to Kamata station, and then home from
Kawasaki station.</p>

<p><p>This is the last day of the nineteens!!!!!!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There's the whole debate about, "well, it's not really the millenium
or even the century cause way back in the day they started counting with
1 not 0 blahdiddyblah."

<p>Yes, I say, but realistically, what is *cool* is seeing those 000
zeros roll up onto the calendar.  I mean, driving in the car people
don't say oh look!  We just turned over 2001 miles!

<p>2000.  That's what's cool.

<p>(plus, kings and such changed the calendars arbitrarily to fit their
schedules or the schedule of the seasons or for whatever reasons they
had at various times back then.)
</blockquote>

<p><p>So anyway, this is the last of the 19s.  I mean I look back at my
ancestors and they may have been born in 1910 or 1903, but just&hellip; just
being born a few years prior and  <em>bing</em> it&rsquo;s 1800s and I think,
&ldquo;man! that&rsquo;s <b>old!</b>&ldquo;</p>

<p><p>So now <em>I</em> was born in the old century, I mean in the 19s.  Well, in
a few hours but yeah!</p>

<p><p><hr></p>

<p><p>At work today I installed Win NT 4.0 into one of the three machines.
Had a little bit of frustration, but I think I got it all down now.</p>

<p><p>First problem was I couldn&rsquo;t get it to recognize the new DMA66 IDE
drive it has.  Turns out Win NT doesn&rsquo;t know about this new thing, so I
had to install the driver from a separate disk.  That only took a few
tries to figure out.</p>

<p><p>Then when I got it installed I recognized I had created &ldquo;too many&rdquo;
partitions on the hard drive.  I had created 3 partitions, which threw
off the default drive letterings for the network drives.  Tried to
reinstall the OS to fix it, but realized I just had to use Disk
Administrator.  Cool.</p>

<p><p>One down, three to go!</p>

<p><p>Fred and I are now at Wende&rsquo;s, about to go play on his unicycle and
stuff.  Y2K downtown on skates tonight!!!!</p>
