<p>Egad I got my credit card bill (yay I have a credit card) and holy
shipes I should have been a bit more careful.  Gotta sort out $450 by
the tenth.  I would think I should have this shit figured out by now.</p>

<p>In other news, Lin and I walked into one of the unfinished homes near
our house.  Did not stay too long and did not go to the second floor
because there were no stairs installed yet.</p>

<p>Oh, and I went to SOGO this morning.  Raisu was back, now living in
Japan so will attend more often.  Kay had to bounce early and Thanuja
was not there at all, but Oliver came!  Yay!  Had not seen him in over
a year.</p>

<p>Oh, and I spent a good bit of time working on ConSwi.</p>

<p>OMG my Japanese teacher has recently been told she has to have
something removed from her throat!</p>

<pre><code>Thank you for your kindness. I think I'll be OK. But to be honest
they'll cut my throat and take something off (sorry!) so I have no
idea how long is going to be until I can speak as a language
tutor. Hope it's soon though. また　たくさん　話しましょうね！
</code></pre>

<p>Yikes stripes!!</p>

<p>I told her I would be happy to take lessons where she just types and
doesn&rsquo;t have to talk.</p>

<p>Boo.  My Macbook&rsquo;s builtin camera isn&rsquo;t responding.  I reset the PRAM
by holding Option Command P R on reboot (though maybe that was being
short circuited by firmware password).</p>

<p>Anyway, boo.</p>

<h2 id="10-33-sunday-11-december-2016-jst">10:33 Sunday 11 December 2016 JST</h2>

<p>I removed my firmware password and then was able to do the PRAM reset
and now the camera works again.</p>

<p>How am I the last one to know this?</p>

<p>We have about seven apps using parse as the backend.</p>

<p>Today I migrated some of our parse data to mlab.com and was able to
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/how-to-set-up-parse-server-on-aws-using-aws-elastic-beanstalk/">set up an elastic beanstalk thing which should hopefully run Parse Server</a>.
Still need to sort it out a bit more.</p>

<p>I took my Suica card out of my wallet this morning and wore it
<em>inside</em> my glove while it was raining.  I held my umbrella and took
the bus to the station with Lin where she took a picture of me
barefoot in the rain.  Gave her a kiss then walked home and when I
went back to the station for work, I noticed my Suica was missing.</p>

<p>Oh that&rsquo;s right I must have taken it out of my glove and not put it
back in my wallet.</p>

<p>Well, now I&rsquo;m home and did a cursory search in all the places where it
should be, and I don&rsquo;t see it.</p>

<p>Good thing it&rsquo;s not possible to load them up with more than $200.</p>

<p>Dang.</p>

<p>Why the heck can&rsquo;t I find an Android app that can scp images using ssh
keys?</p>

<p>There are plenty of ssh apps, but not scp.. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sk.vx.connectbot">VXConnectBot</a> allegedly added
scp to
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.connectbot&amp;hl=en">ConnectBot</a>,
but I don&rsquo;t see how to get scp to work on it.</p>

<p>Ah, I found a way to
<a href="https://github.com/vx/connectbot/issues/74#issuecomment-20804161">upload files from my phone using VXConnectBot</a>.
It&rsquo;s convoluted, and can only do one at a time, but it&rsquo;s better than
zero.</p>

<p>Three people are in an apartment: Rob (American, slightly unshaven),
Fred (younger brother, very unshaven), Lin (attractive asian-looking
woman)</p>

<p>Rob: <code>Okay guys, let's go skydiving!</code></p>

<p>The trio walk outside into a glorious sun filled afternoon and head to
the parking lot.</p>

<p>Fred: <code>Dude.  Where's my car?</code></p>

<p>Rob: <code>Aw man this ain't cool.</code></p>

<p>Lin: <code>Where did you park it?</code></p>

<p>Fred immediately calls someone on the phone.  Rob and Lin overhear
Fred speaking to an unknown character named MA.</p>

<p>Fred: <code>... so can you come take us to the skydiving place?</code></p>

<p>Fred: <code>Okay.  Okay thanks bye</code></p>

<p>Fred rejoins Lin and Rob.</p>

<p>Fred: <code>yeah so apparently they tow.</code></p>

<p>Rob: <code>fuckers</code></p>

<p>Lin: <code>Oh Fred I'm sorry!</code></p>

<p>Fred&rsquo;s phone rings again.</p>

<p>Fred: <code>Hello?</code></p>

<p>Fred: <code>Oh! Okay.  See you in a sec.</code></p>

<p>Fred (to Rob and Lin): <code>She's going to swap apartments with us.</code></p>

<p><code>We'll take her car and they'll stay here</code></p>
