<p><em>The Joker tossed the head of her husband through the window.  She looked in horror as it spoke to her, like, &ldquo;surprise!!&rdquo; and I saw attached a canister with poison gas spewing out;  she got covered in gas and her head popped off and her face sunk into a spherical glass shell the size of her skull and rolled back toward The Joker; her head had become a bomb for his next target.  I escaped the gas by flying out of the room at great speed and relatively good flying control.  </em></p>

<p><em>Searching for Batman, I found him flying over the city, and caught up to him by flying a great arc past his position, and said his name quietly as I went by.  He turned to follow me, and we landed together along with Batgirl and all got into an extremely thin elevator.   Standing side by side with our backs against the wall, we had to hold the rickety door closed for there to be enough space as it squeezed up through the walls into a warehouse in which Batman had his latest car.</em></p>

<p><em>He explained that this car couldn&rsquo;t fly, but that it could crash through anything and remain unscathed, which he proved by driving through a display of bananas on some boxes set up in the warehouse by his crew.   He told me I needed to drive, so I hopped into the car (a convertible) and drove into the super market where The Joker was planning to attack next.   I learned to steer and control the acceleration with the yoke in front of me, as I weaved in and out of crowds in the super market.  In desperation to not squish a shopper, I found I <em>could</em> make the car fly a bit as I jumped over her like a BMX bunny hop, but with the latest Batmobile.</em></p>

<p><em>I made a few circuits of the store and then I saw some nefarious looking fellows doing nefarious looking activity in their black leather jackets and knew they had to be the bad guys, especially as one tried to hook the car and tie it to an industrial sized shelf.</em></p>

<p><em>I escaped the hook with some tricky maneuvers, and started to try stomping them with the car, but wasn&rsquo;t quite successful as I didn&rsquo;t have good enough control (due to dream inertia) and didn&rsquo;t catch them before I woke up.</em></p>
