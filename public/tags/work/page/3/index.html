<p>Today (and most Thursdays) I taught at SCC in Kawasaki.  Naoko
reviewed for her test next week.  Yasu reviewed the same material for
his test sometime in the future.  Azusa did much better with her
fluency and intonation for her presentation.  Liliko asked about the
brochure that has to change soon to accomodate new opening times.</p>

<p>After the lessons I went to say HI to Tomoko and Midori, but Midori
had the day off.  Tomoko showed me how to RSVP on Circle Square for
next month&rsquo;s badminton game.</p>

<p>Although I have not gotten all the way to the part of MLAPHP that we
are supposed to be adding tests, I am close enough that I can add some
tests. They have helped a <em>lot</em>, like OMG how did I live without
tests?  It hasn&rsquo;t been so long that I don&rsquo;t remember what it was like,
and I sure like this better.</p>

<p>Right now I am working on upgrading to a new version of Datatables so
it can access <code>table.row()</code> but I get the error</p>

<pre><code>Uncaught TypeError: table.row is not a function
</code></pre>

<p>It&rsquo;s not just not a function&hellip; <code>table.row</code> is <code>undefined</code>.</p>

<p>Maybe 1.10.19 of datatables is not the latest after all..</p>

<p>In the first adult lesson at JB, we flexed some reported speech
muscles with Side By Side book 1, where the target language is &ldquo;This
is a photograph of my son Bart.  He is riding a skateboard outside our
house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We changed it to be &ldquo;This is a photograph of me riding a skateboard in
from of my house&rdquo; and then &ldquo;That is a photograph of him riding a
skateboard in from of his house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the second adult lesson, Hide and I told Yutaro to look up WTC7.
Yutaro was 8 years old on Airplane Day (, the name Fred and I use for
the day).</p>

<p>In the last lesson, students came in one by one.  We talked about
movies for a bit and then read a brief story about a couple who gave
away a lot of their lottery winnings and thereby did not let the money
change them.  Kaori listened to it twice without reading.  Kyoko and
Misato both listened once and then read along the second time.</p>

<p>New vocab:</p>

<ul>
<li>ruin</li>
<li>indeed</li>
<li>owe</li>
</ul>

<li>Lin and I still have our cat Jennie, still keep her in at night,
still live in Asao-ku near the bottom of a hill.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m still working on Marble Track 3, trying to do at least 2 hours
of livestream per week.</li>
<li>I have been working on AB, getting tests added to cover the
important parts of the codebase.  I do not have a lot covered, but
10 tests is an order of magnitude more than 0.</li>
<li>Plus I figured out a way to test AJAX even though I cannot use
Javascript in my tests yet.  (run the AJAX call directly)</li>
<li>I have all my flights purchased for my trip to Vancouver, Houston,
Austin, Hawaii, all focused on MKP, but trying to see some of my
peeps.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, I messed up regarding seeing Colleenie Beanie
<em>again</em> this year.  I said I will sort it out for sure next year
and she said &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;   Fair enough.</li>
<li>I gotta let my Houston and Austin peeps know.</li>
<li>Have written two video briefs to make two MKP videos. One focused
on inviting men to our circle, and one focused on inviting support
for our circle and expanding into Japanese language.</li>
<li>I have recently been in touch with Brian (also in IT), Tony (truck
driver), and Frederick (change agent) via Zoom.  I asked for
support from them when I was beginning to get overwhelmed with all
the tasks across my variety of projects.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.marbletrack3.com/">Marble Track 3</a> has had its site
updated via Deligence.  I think we had some minor communication

Maybe I should hire some other peeps to work on it more.</li>

<p>I had a weird issue with crontab today.</p>

<p>If I editted the crontab while logged in as root, it did not work.</p>

<pre><code>$# whoami
root
$# crontab -e
   ((( make edits )))
crontab: installing new crontab
</code></pre>

<p>But the changes did not work.</p>

<pre><code>$# exit
$ whoami
ubuntu
sudo crontab -e
   ((( make edits )))
crontab: installing new crontab
</code></pre>

<p>And the changes work just fine.</p>

<p>One clear difference was user ubuntu was using nano to edit, while
user root was using emacs&hellip;  But seems weird if that would make a
difference.</p>

<p>The same cronfile was edited both times.</p>

<p>Anyway, I got it working by <code>sudo crontab -e</code> instead of having root
do <code>crontab -e</code>.</p>

<p>It has taken me a long time to reach this point, but from
<a href="/journal/1997/11/15/new-warrior-training">being afraid of men</a> in
1997, I am now facilitating deep emotional work in men&rsquo;s circles every
week, both online and face to face in Tokyo.</p>

<p>I want to deepen my skills as a facilitator and have decided to step
more fully into this emotional awareness work.  To improve my facilitation
skills, I plan to staff two (2)
<a href="https://nwta.mkp.org">New Warrior Training Adventure</a> weekends, back
to back in March and April.  (full disclosure, I will also attend the
MKP Face to Face Gathering in March, but I do not completely know what
that will include.)</p>

<p>To this end, Jeremy was like, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you put together a Gofundme
page to help raise money for the trip?&rdquo;  Wow great idea!  Then Michael
was like, &ldquo;the trip is just the starting point; let&rsquo;s start Mankind
Project Japan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He worked out a bare bones budget for 2019, but it is still beyond
what I have ever thought about.  Life changing work.</p>

<p>One of the AB cronjobs has been throwing errors, but the job is still
running.</p>

<p>I am in the middle of refactoring the code to use Dependency
Injection; I don&rsquo;t know how I broke something, but I cannot really go
back to a previous version.  Rather, I don&rsquo;t know what version to go
back to, and my local dev environment cannot recreate the error.</p>

<p>Annoyingly, my local dev environment cannot even access Ye Olde
Interneffe so I cannot easily revert local files to a previous state
anyway.</p>

<pre><code>both frontend and backend use Localizer::getInstance in these
classes. Inject it instead of reference Singleton

./Data/Unit.php
./DeviceHandler.php
./SiteHandler.php
./Template.php
./Translator.php
</code></pre>

<p>I am in the middle of doing <code>\Data\Unit</code>.  Perhaps once I finish that,
I can push, deploy, and pray.</p>

<p>There are 19 more places to change instantiations of <code>\Data\Unit</code>,
including in <code>\Factory\UnitFactory</code>.</p>

<p>I am curious if I misread or misunderstood the MLAPHP book which said
we are making small incremental changes.  This little change seems to
have blown up a bit, due to classes which instantiate <code>\Data\Unit</code> and
should eventually have its dependencies injected into them as well.</p>
