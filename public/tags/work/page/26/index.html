<p>Three tickets for HA site, and haven&rsquo;t been able to finish any of

<p>They require more info or send to someone else or get corrected files

<p>It&rsquo;s actually not automated testing FTW yet; it&rsquo;s my choice to
carefully go through all the tests even though I am anxious to get the
changes to live server before I go on vacation FTW.</p>

<p>I have a list of tests that I was performing manually, and am now in
the process of performing them all manually just a couple more times
as I teach <a href="https://ghostinspector.com/">Ghost Inspector</a> how to do
them for me.  While teaching Mr Ghost how to do a test, the server
didn&rsquo;t pass the test!  I was like, &ldquo;awww crap!  Oh wait!  Wooo to the
Hooo!!!!&rdquo; because I hadn&rsquo;t moved broken code online.</p>

<p>I just noticed a gap in my recent journal entry dates.. I bet I was on
my computer all day Monday&hellip; oh but I remember I slept 12 hours (!!)
from 8pm to 8am after having a headache after (carrying my heavy bag
to and from) the ET Contact weekend at Pyramid Meditation Center near
Yanagawa station.</p>

<p>Being on my computer all day doesn&rsquo;t mean I <em>worked</em> all day, but
probably included watching an episode of Family Guy, which I remember
having done recently.</p>

<p>Oops shit.  I didn&rsquo;t fully test the system before putting admin server
live.  That shit won&rsquo;t happen again because I&rsquo;ve got Ghost Inspector
on my side, helping me inspect the site.  I&rsquo;ve taught it how to test
logging in, fucking up the log in, viewing the units list, and the
unit edit page, as well as the group-of-units list and the
group-of-units edit page.</p>

<p>I still need to teach it how to check inquiries, both saved and
unsaved, plus contacts, owners, sets and some other shit, but thanks
to Ghost Inspector Runscape package, I get 1000 free tests per month.
Yay!  I really want to pay them something though.  I paid Alan who
made ngrok so I figure I might as well pay Ghost Inspector cause it
seems they are actually doing more.</p>

<p>As soon as I get home, I&rsquo;ll push this not fully tested fix online,
then get back to making more tests.  Aww yeah.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t been able to log in to my local machine using ngrok.com
because of something I haven&rsquo;t probably figured out yet.  Earlier
today, I realized the problem must be that I&rsquo;m trying to setcookie on
the wrong domain, or rather, on the domain my local box sees, and not
on ngrok.com.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t test it directly because I&rsquo;m currently offline, but I tried to
break the cookie here locally, but I can still log in.  Dammit.</p>

<p>I should enjoy this moment when I&rsquo;m upset that I can log in to
something.</p>

<p>I left the toy store early today so I could confirm I had found the
source of the problem, but I cannot confirm it.  So now I&rsquo;m stuck in
the conveni which features hundreds of items I might consume if
hungry, and even some things I&rsquo;m trying to resist buying now.</p>

<p>I just want to sleep.  Or actually I want to have web access.</p>

<p>A few days ago I signed up for <a href="https://ghostinspector.com/">Ghost Inspector</a> and thought hmmm I&rsquo;d love to have 1000
tests per month instead of just 100.</p>

<p>Boom they have that option!</p>

<pre><code>We're glad you're enjoying the product! Unfortunately, we don't
offer any paid plans that are less than 10,000 test
runs/month. However, we do have a promotion with Runscope (our
parent company) where your free account will be bumped up from the
100 test runs per month on the default free plan to 1,000 test
runs per month if you sign up for both services.
</code></pre>

<p>I signed up for <a href="https://www.runscope.com/">runscope</a> and set up an API test to boot!</p>

<p>I just bought an account on <a href="https://ngrok.com">https://ngrok.com</a> so I can use ghost inspector to
test my local machines running on virtualbox.  Sweet!</p>

<p>I sent a couple emails back and forth with Alan who quickly solved the
setup issue I was having.  He showed me how I can easily use ngrok to
test my site which only exists on my local virtualbox machine via a
domain which only exists in my <code>/etc/hosts</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>./ngrok http -host-header=mylocal.exampledomain.net  mylocal.exampledomain.net:80
</code></pre>

<p>And now that I&rsquo;ve signed up, I have reserved rob.ngrok.io as one of my
three reserved names for connection tunnels!</p>

<pre><code>./ngrok http -host-header=mylocal.exampledomain.net -subdomain rob  mylocal.exampledomain.net:80
</code></pre>

<p>Shwiing!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m consdering buying an account with <a href="ghostinspector.com">ghostinspector</a>, but the lowest
price is a bit high for me .. $100 per month for 10,000 tests per
month.  If it were $100 per year for 1000 tests per month, then I&rsquo;d
have it already.</p>

<p>I spoke on the phone for 1.5 hours to a guy at AWS support.  He was
patient, understanding, helpful, and many other things that I
appreciated.  He summarized the convo for me, pasted below with some
parts redacted:</p>

<pre><code>Hi,

Thanks for contacting AWS Premium Support. It was a pleasure to speak
with you today in relation to the errors your clients encountered when
accessing your website CB.

I understand in the call that you have set up a Cloudfront
distribution point to serve the requests when users are requesting
images, and it is using ELB (redazzle) as its origin. Meanwhile, your
clients are uploading images to fileswarm.net which is pointing to
your ELB, and in turn images are stored on your backend instances. You
mentioned that in the past 3 days, between 5:00pm and 9:00pm GMT+9,
your clients were seeing some HTTP errors when accessing your website,
but you haven't capture the exact errors they were seeing.

You mentioned that the issues also appeared when uploading the images,
then I started troubleshooting on ELB because this traffic didn't go
through Cloudfront. I notice a few ELB HTTP 5XX errors, and some
spikes on the Max latency which almost reached to 60 seconds, which is
the default timeout value defined on the ELB.

You've enabled the ELB access log so we can have the exact ELB HTTP
5XX errors next time similar issue happens again. From the ELB access
log, you can also see the source IP, requested URL, HTTP response
code, etc. You also have enabled the parameter in Apache configuration
on the backends to record the time used to process the requests. As we
can see in the screenshare, with these information in hand, you can
cross check them to see why some requests are taking longer to be
processed, or not be able to be processed.

What I missed in the call is that you could also enable Access logs on
CloudFront, which will record the data of customers' requests as well
as the responses, and of course, any errors will be shown there as
well.

So next time when the issues happens, you can try to access the
image/upload the image to your website, and since they are traversing
through different paths, you will be able identify where the issue
resides, and use the logs above mentioned to further troubleshooting
the issue.

Lastly, below are the links we used to enable the %T parameter in
Apache, as well as how you could interpret the information recorded in
ELB access log.

I hope you will find above information helpful, if you need any
further assistance, please feel free to contact us again anytime, we
will be delighted to help you further.

Best regards,

<p>Afterwards, I watched 2 or so hours of instruction on udemy about AWS.
It seems like a great course, and well worth the current sales price!</p>
