<p>Met Yaw for the first time at Liz English School.  He and I got on
quite well, and even shared a prayer for world peace and supporting
our community and family. I look forward to working closely with him
in the future.</p>

<p>5:30pm meeting is underway, but I am only being asked questions via
text while here at JB since they are doing it in Japanese (at CB).</p>

<h2 id="17-47">17:47</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m dialed in now.</p>

<h2 id="17-51">17:51</h2>

<p>They are asking how the API works.  I explained it is like a web
server which gives just data instead of data and HTML.  They said they
understand that, but how does it <em>work</em>?</p>

<p>I explained I have never touched the code of this particular API.</p>

<p>Listening to this now, I am thankful I don&rsquo;t generally have to sit
through business meetings in Japanese.</p>

<h2 id="18-00">18:00</h2>

<p>I was told that they only had until 6pm, but the meeting is showing no
signs of being finished.</p>

<h2 id="18-07">18:07</h2>

<p>I think Nate is making some good points.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>Basically he is saying what I said: &ldquo;you should have said something
before (months ago).&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="22-45-wednesday-11-october-2017-jst">22:45 Wednesday 11 October 2017 JST</h2>

<p>Okay the end result is that I will meet with them and answer their
questions about the API.</p>

<p>Good lesson today at TB; they had just redone the place so I got a
grand tour of the show room.  Midori talked to some clients while
Tomoko gave me the tour.  They didn&rsquo;t have anything to check yet, but
I saw lots of word-for-word translations which we will have to clean
up later.</p>

<p>They actually had to leave 10 minutes earlier than normal, so I headed
out at 1:50pm.</p>

<p>Worked at NB on Tuesday, my first lesson there that only lasted 1
hour.  Boo.  It was okay going all the way there for 2 hours, but just
for 1 hour kinda sucks.  I hope we can work out something else, like
maybe they buy lunch as well.</p>

<p>NA is the two letter designation for a new lesson I will be teaching
on Mondays.  It is within walking distance of the Monday morning
lesson, but there is a bit of a gap in between so I am chilling at a
restaurant in Tokyo Tower.</p>

<h2 id="15-35-monday-25-september-2017-jst">15:35 Monday 25 September 2017 JST</h2>

<p>Lesson was tough at first when I tried terribly to explain my
intention to the group of quietly patient students.  Man oh man they
had a bilingual woman last time; how I wished she had been in
attendance!</p>

<p>Got it sorted out after I started doing role plays, in which,
fortunately, I was able to incorporate some of the words we had gone
over before.  Yay for winging it!</p>

<p>In other news; it looks like a boat race place is being built in
Roppongi!  Ain&rsquo;t water for miles around but the signs at a
construction site were all about boat racing.</p>

<p>Just got home via taxi with Lin after eating ice cream with her near
our station.  I got Ben and Jerry&rsquo;s cotton candy (which was similar to
Baskin Robbin&rsquo;s Popping Shower), and she got cherry by some other
premium brand, the name of which escapes me now.</p>

<p>Lin and I took the same train from Noborito to our station.  She had
gotten on near Shinjuku, and we did not specifically plan to take the
same train, but it worked out that way.  I was near the front and she
was near the back so we didn&rsquo;t see each other until we actually got up
to the concourse platform of our station.</p>

<p>She had been at work all day and I had just taken the Nambu Line from
Kawasaki to Noborito after taking Yamanote and K-T Line with Lisa,
after walking with Lisa and Jorge from Nishi Azabu to Shibuya (30
minutes or so) after our eighth 2 hour meeting (of eight).</p>

<p>I made it to the meeting a tiny bit more rushed than normal, but I
arrived on time after having visited Paola to receive my second <a href="https://www.bachcentre.com/centre/firstpag.htm">Bach
herbal remedies</a> bottle
from her.  Paola also fed me some rice she had made, plus a pear.  I
showed her the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KjsYc4Mb5g&amp;list=PL0osPGt21FB48UwuhtCUoi9JndC9YDHAZ">playlist of latest Marble Track 3</a>
and she subscribed!  I now have 3 subscribers yay!</p>

<p>Anyway, that was after I had teached in Nihonbashi, which was after I
added several exposures to the third snippet of Marble Track 3
videos.  Today I uploaded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_arPJhJoIFM">drilled one hole</a>.</p>
