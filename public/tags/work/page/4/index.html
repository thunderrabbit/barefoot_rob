<h5 id="20-42-wednesday-09-january-2019-jst">20:42 Wednesday 09 January 2019 JST</h5>

<p>Today was a long day, starting with recording a first draft of a video
for my first GoFundMe campaign, then two TY lessons, two MKP meetings,
lunch with Tomoko, then an hour chillin with &ldquo;a flower in each hand&rdquo;
behind the desk of the Sweets Party Attendants, having a non-lesson
with them because they have nothing going on.</p>

<p>During this non-lesson, Tomoko showed me her &ldquo;personal こたつ&rdquo; which
consisted of a heater under her desk and a blanket strategically
arranged to drape down over her legs.  I showed them the latest MT3
video clip,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&amp;video_id=OHCg01--Zsc">cut and glued 7th outer spiral support</a>.
M&rsquo;s comment was (something like) 「思ったより短い」(but she translated
it as &ldquo;not as much progress as I expected&rdquo;, so I know my adjective is
wrong in Japanese).  Tomoko said she would work on translating more of
the website.  I knew I was stretching it to invite her to (create a
Github account, learn git and) do pull requests (but I tried anyway,)
and when she saw the source code of a page she commented 「難しい！」
so I apologized and thanked her for anything she could do.</p>

<p>Then headed to JB where we practiced &ldquo;Happy New Year&rdquo; with kids
lessons and played a variant of UNO targeting adjectives, animal
names, body parts, and a
couple semantic rules:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see a red nose; I play a red dog&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then with the adults in my 8pm class things like &ldquo;I see a reindeer
with brown antlers; I play a tiger standing in front of brown trees&rdquo;
and culminating with Hide&rsquo;s &ldquo;I see an elephant standing on yellow sand
and wearing a yellow ribbon; I play an elephant standing on yellow
sand and wearing a yellow ribbon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then with the adults in my 9pm class all calling in absent, I got to
head home early.  I am one station from Noborito now when the class
would just be finishing.</p>

<h5 id="21-56-wednesday-09-january-2019-jst">21:56 Wednesday 09 January 2019 JST</h5>

<p>And now I would be just a station or two from Noborito, but Lin and I
are home.  yay!</p>

<p>I am on the way home after my last 2018 lesson at JB.  I thought we
had lessons next week, but apparently not!  I kinda sorta wish we did
have to work next week; the monies would be nice, but I guess I can
work on AB during that time.</p>

<p>Yikes I derped and did not do my task for TY.  First time, but I will
definitely not miss again.</p>

<p>JB classes were fun; we used fake money notes as money in the 4:30pm kids
class (Suzu, Kanta, Toshiro), and then I used them again in 8pm adult
class (Misato, Kaori).</p>

<p>Working on ConSwi now, refactoring to make pieces move themselves
down, and get a ton of code out of the main

<p>Just finished four lessons at SCC: Naoko, Liliko, Hitomi, and Yasu
each had 30 minute lessons, practicing various parts of their
presentations.</p>

<p>During the first two lessons, my nose was running like yuck.  I used a
bunch of toilet paper and tissues blowing all the snot out.</p>

<p>This morning I worked on MT3 for 1.5 hours or so, getting maybe 8
frames taken.  At this point, I am working on version 2 of the
website, which focuses on the characters making the track instead of
me making the characters make the track.</p>

<p>Men&rsquo;s group at 10:30 featured 10 or 11 men, a relatively big group.  I
had a great cry during which I realized I feel tons of shame and
sadness about how much I have <em>not</em> accomplished in Japan.  I should
be making a good living, but I am still paycheck to paycheck and it
sucks.  That is the main reason I cannot go back to US every year.</p>

<p>In other news:</p>

<ul>
<li>I will go on Monday to replace <em>both</em> fans and the battery in this
computer (MacBook Pro, 2012)</li>
<li>I have gotten more than half of the classes in AB websites to be
autoloaded per <a href="https://leanpub.com/mlaphp">MLAPHP</a></li>
<li>Will meet Tariq tomorrow to finalize(?) the specs/screens for
version 1 of ConSwi</li>
<li>In the middle of training at TY, helping Jay with that.</li>
<li>Great workshop presentation by Dora yesterday, and am inspired to do
the same myself, but $3000?  See the above-mentioned
paycheck-to-paycheck comment.</li>

<p>I can basically tell how busy I am by how much time I (don&rsquo;t) spend
writing in my journal.  Inverse relationship between entries and busy.
It&rsquo;s not surprising, but just a thing to note.</p>

<p>Recently, my &ldquo;journaling&rdquo; has included Marble Track 3 website, and
<em>that</em> has included revamping the website a bit.</p>

<p>I have been upgrading AB&rsquo;s PHP to the standards described in
<a href="https://leanpub.com/mlaphp">Paul Jones&rsquo; Modernizing Legacy Applications in PHP</a>.
So far I am still in the Autoloading section, but have done nearly
half of the classes.  Almost all of the &ldquo;data&rdquo; classes are done, but
none of the search or factory classes are done.</p>

<p>(I put data in quotes above because I think that is just a name we
came up with ..  not sure if it has a meaning outside our project.)</p>

<p>But that is not why I am writing.  I was just reading Troy Hunt
talking about passwords and want to add the HIBP password check to the
site.  I am glad we do not really limit the passwords (much; we do
crop them at a few hundred characters, but I now know to not do that),
but I am not sure I can get buy-in to require everyone to have good
passwords.</p>

<p>I am thinking I will log if passwords have been cracked, but that may
be a security issue itself.  Not sure.</p>

<p>The lessons I teach on Wednesday morning used to be on Thursday
mornings.  They were one of the first lessons I taught for JB.  Pretty
convenient when Lin and I lived near Kawasaki station, but now it
takes over an hour to go each way for an hour lesson.</p>

<p>Once I win the lottery, this will be one of the first lessons I
release because I have to leave the house by 5:45 to get a seat on the
train on the way there (or leave by 6:15 and stand for 40 minutes
total on (two) trains).</p>

<p>Two years ago, Mayumi gave me
<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=hanayama+marble+images&amp;ia=images">Hanayama Marble</a>.
After playing with it for weeks, I nearly solved it, but in a fit of
frustration gave up and looked up the answer online.  Upon seeing the
solution, I thought &ldquo;ahhhh crap of course!!!&rdquo;  It is such an elegant
solution and I was nearly there.</p>

<p>Four weeks ago, in this class, we started playing a pattern matching
word game.  For fun, I started with the same word one of the students
had started with.</p>

<ul>
<li>Haneda Airport</li>
<li>LA International Airport</li>
<li>Mt Fuji</li>
<li>Kobe Airport</li>
</ul>

<p>I thought they would be able to solve it quickly, but this went on for
four weeks until I finally had to pull the plug because one of the
students expression was like <em>fuck this</em>.  I ended up giving them the
answer and the same student was like &ldquo;ahhhh crap of course!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So in honor of that, today I brought my Hanayama Marble puzzle and
left it with one of the students to play with.</p>

<p>Still going through MLAPHP for the AB project.  I guess I am about
halfway through the step of naming all the class definition files so
they can be loaded via the autoloader.</p>

<p>During this process I found <a href="https://www.mabl.com/">Mabl</a> which
features a short domain name and some tools for automated testing.
Pretty easy onboarding, and they are giving the site a good onceover
every day.</p>

<p>Eventually need to create a staging system with fake data so they can
give the backend a daily look as well.</p>

<p>Helped with training at TY&rsquo;s today.  Onboarding new instructors is a
learning process in itself.</p>
