<p>This is the fourth to last lesson at BRIDGE.  They started off strong,
but then started to get busy quite quickly last summer.  Two hours of
lessons went down to 1 hour which sucked considering it took 3 hours
round trip travel.  But I kept at it.  During December they cancelled
January saying they will be too busy.  So I had a nice break during
January, during which they said the will end at the end of February.</p>

<p>Yikes my previously-used JQuery CDN isn&rsquo;t responding so I replaced it
and now the main page of the site breaks.  When did that start
happening?  What do I do?  How do I find someone to take over this
site?  (that is my real question / I do not want to maintain it forever)</p>

needed before the meeting and everything went well.  Got them a new
account set up and on Wednesday night I will transfer their server
from our account to theirs.</p>

<p>Three hours of lessons in SCC today; looking forward to it!</p>

<p>On the way there, I hope to figure out why my local version of
mypowercircle.org will not compile with Hugo.  bah.  it was supposed
to be easy!!</p>

<p>Ah. I had gotten stuck trying to add Japanese language version of the
site, but never got it working.  It&rsquo;s better to just have an actual
Japanese speaker make the Japanese site, so I cut out the Japanese
content from the site and now it&rsquo;s working again.</p>

<p>First three classes were fine today, though I have been asked to blow
through a book super fast to let one class catch up with another
class.  I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s how it works.</p>

<p>In other news, JB has a new owner, who seems nice enough that I can
keep working here.  Really curious as to how much they paid!</p>

<p>I worked for four companies yesterday.  First was my lesson in
Akabanebashi for Tariq.  Then walked to Nishi Azabu for MR
Laboratories client (company DNE yet).  Then walked across the Nishi
Azabu intersection to a lesson for TESS.  Then bus and train to
Kawasaki for 2 hours of lessons at my favorite, SCC.  Came home and
had one more lesson for MR Laboratories.</p>

<p>Today was the first time I worked five hours at SCC.  Due to a
schedule snafu, 1.5 hours with Liliko chatting about her trip to
Sydney and my trip to OZ, then Rick and Morty and Lucifer.  I didn&rsquo;t
think of Dirk Gently, but she considered getting Netflix to see the
others.</p>

<p>Now I am in Akihabara, across the street from GG lesson which starts
at 18:30.</p>

<p>I bought a trackball mouse to replace the one I had before which seems
to just mysteriously and annoyingly not work anymore.  This time I
will keep the receipt because I think the old one konked out before
its warranty was up.</p>

<p>Today was the first of five 2-hour lessons this month at SCC.  Today I
helped Tomoko by making corrections to her written English.  She plans
to present the features of some of her company&rsquo;s products.  Pretty
cool stuff like elevators and batteries, and elevators that run on
batteries.  We studied up in their cafeteria on the 4th floor, and
then I went down the escalator to the third floor and went out the
exit I had never gone out before (but had seen many times).  Neat!</p>

<p>I am on the train and the above is as far as I got before
sidetracking myself with something before having a meeting with TY at
9am then lunch with Lin.</p>

<p>Today:</p>

<ul>
<li>I got my AWS account switched to JPY instead of USD so I can pay
more efficiently.</li>
<li>I said Sorry to Alan of ngrok for letting my account lapse; he
replied immediately after pausing it for me.</li>
<li>Lin and I walked to the train station.  Weather is cold and windy
but features a clear blue sky.</li>
<li>Chatting with Michael a bit; I will meet him on Friday after work.</li>
<li>I forgot to bring</li>
<li>I thought of a reasonable crypto currency to make: Curios, which
will have the feature of being valueless so people who are curious
about cryptocurrencies can get into them without worries.  We will
just give away 10,000 coins to anyone who wants them and just let
