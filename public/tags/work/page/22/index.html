<p>In addition to fixing the functionality of a survey thing, I watched
an hour of David Blaine freak people out, and nearly got my ansible
thing to install a website, but it&rsquo;s not working 100% due to an AJAX
call returning 404 on the test system.  Is it due to the fact that
I&rsquo;ve got the domain set to the test IP locally?  Hmmm..</p>

&ldquo;oh can you change the design that we asked you to change before?&rdquo;
bah.</p>

<p>Today it was, &ldquo;can you add a new page to the site based on this old
page that allows users to submit content?  We&rsquo;ll do the design after
you upload it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yay!  No problem.</p>

<p>Lin offered to drive me to the station because it was raining.  I
declined her offer because it&rsquo;s a waste of gas, and the rain wasn&rsquo;t
torrential.  But even now, the fact that I declined her offer is stuck
in my head.</p>

<p>I arrived 10 minutes early for my morning lesson.</p>

<p>This morning&rsquo;s lesson featured an article about something about
something.  Man what was it?</p>

<p>Oh yes: Tokyo University has decided to give $300 per month to newly
enrolled women in an attempt to increase enrollment.</p>

<p>Ummmm yeah if they&rsquo;re already enrolled, paying them won&rsquo;t help enrollment.</p>

<p>Worked today with S at s and finally figured out Google Doubleclick
For Providers or whatever it&rsquo;s called.  Basically there&rsquo;s inventory
and orders.  Inventory has ad units and ad placements (multiple ad
units).  Orders have line items which have creatives.  Orders can have
multiple line items.  Creatives are many-to-many with Line items.
Creatives are basically banners or videos the end users will see as
ads.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s scaffolding all around the building where I taught five
lessons this evening.  After they were finished, I climbed on the
scaffolding a little bit.  I could have climbed up quite high, but
chose not to for reasons of propriety.  It was my first time to climb
on scaffolding like this in Japan.  Usually they close it off quite
carefully.. but not in this case.  (^_^)V</p>

<p>The students in the fourth lesson all cancelled so I did a language
exchange with Tomomi.</p>

<p>I worked three jobs today..  not full time shifts, but I worked for 3
distinct companies.  First in Akabanebashi I taught the early lesson I
usually teach on Mondays, but they moved it to today for some reason.</p>

<p>Then I went to my programming job in Ebisu where I did a tiny bit of (unpaid)
work while mostly preparing for PechaKucha.</p>

<p>Then headed to JB where I taught for five hours.  This is quite new
for me; I was teaching 1 hour on Wednesdays for them, so this is a
welcome change.  It&rsquo;s not 5 times the pay, but it&rsquo;s definitely more,
and definitely closer to home.</p>

<p>Because Lin and I moved to Shin Yurigaoka, my commute to Fukuura cost
more than I was paid for travel, so I mentioned that to them and then
boom new Wednesday schedule starting yesterday.  Two classes were new
students for me; kids classes, so it will be a good chance to get some
experience with kids classes.  Next week there will be 3 other classes
as well; with adults, I guess.</p>

<p>Because of the daylight saving time change in the US, my Thursday
schedule has a new hour gap before online men&rsquo;s group.  Right now I&rsquo;m
chilling in what I call the Zavas building, overlooking the water
fountain, which is being cleaned today.  In a few minutes, I&rsquo;ll head
over to Lazona for early lunch before I-group meeting.</p>

<p>Because it&rsquo;s been a while, I contacted Kai to see if she&rsquo;d like to
have lunch.  It took a month to get on her schedule, but we&rsquo;re going
to California Pizza Kitchen today.  Yay CPK!</p>

<p>While taking a bath, I just talked to Fred for 45+ minutes on the
phone, rubber ducking a problem with him.</p>

<p>Before I started working on this a couple days ago, I did the
following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Save a list of indices each time the user tweaks a search on index</li>
<li>Once a record is selected, use the indices to allow prev/next</li>
<li>Rerun the search if they go back to the index</li>
</ol>

<p>This worked fine at first, but item #1 above now takes too much time
now that the DB has grown.</p>

<p>So my new idea was the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Save the query as user tweaks the search on index</li>
<li>Once a record is selected, run the query with LIMIT / OFFSET to
allow prev/next</li>
<li>Rerun the query if they go back to the index</li>
</ol>

<p>This makes #1 faster in that I don&rsquo;t have to save all the indices.  It
makes #2 slower in that I run the query each time, but oh well.</p>

<p>However, after talking to Fred, I realize #2 is flawed much more
deeply.  If a record is selected, then edited such that the query
won&rsquo;t find it, then the prev/next will get borked.</p>

<p>So, here&rsquo;s the solution I&rsquo;ve decided to do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Save the query as user tweaks the search on index</li>
<li>Once a record is selected, use the query to create a list of
indices for the query and save them to disk</li>
<li>Use the list of indices to allow prev/next</li>
<li>Use the query only if they go back to the index</li>
</ol>

<p>This way, #2 can be run while the initial record is loading, which
will take a bit of time, but I intend to run it asynchronously so it
won&rsquo;t really affect the load time, except for prev/next buttons.</p>

<p>Thanks, Fred!</p>
