<p>Today S at CB requested they be able to preview articles before
they&rsquo;re published.  I was like, &ldquo;um, it&rsquo;s already finished,&rdquo; because
Alfonzo wrote that functionality ages ago.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow! I didn&rsquo;t know that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So now they want to preview other things, so I&rsquo;ll be copying his code
to those other not-yet-previewable things.</p>

<p>Satomi came down at the perfect time; I had just finished and
committed a set of changes for a new process for the AB site.  They
want new data added to the historical primary tables, gleaned from
data in the secondary tables (basically log tables).</p>

<p>Basically things in the primary table can be active or inactive.  We
have a log of when they were activated and deactivated.  The cycle of
(in)active toggles can spans years at times, or could just be days.</p>

<p>Each month I take a snapshot of the primary data for doing trend
reports.  Now, the snapshots obviously know if their rows are active
or inactive at the time of the snapshot, but they don&rsquo;t know how
<em>long</em> they had been (in)active at the time of the snapshot.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what my new code needs to do.  Go back and look at the log,
calculate the ranges of (in)activity, and fill in the newly-created
blanks in the historical snapshots.  Fun!</p>

<p>Fortunately, it&rsquo;s a DB table &ldquo;log&rdquo; so there&rsquo;s no text parsing
required.  But I do have to deal with objects being set to inactive or
to active multiple times in a row. something like this, for item
number 5, (but with a lot more data haha):</p>

<pre><code>5  inactive 2004-03-06
5  active   2004-08-28
5  inactive 2006-11-12
5  active   2007-07-28
5  active   2007-09-24
5  inactive 2009-06-21
5  active   2010-04-03

<p>So S-san at AB used the new function that I added, but it didn&rsquo;t seem
to fully work.  I tested it locally so I&rsquo;m not sure what&rsquo;s wrong.
Basically it&rsquo;s supposed to edit historical data, but it didn&rsquo;t seem to
work for one set of tables.</p>

<p>While looking at the historical tables to see what had changed, I
found a record missing from all the tables!  Oh noooes!  Did my code
delete it somehow?  Yikes stripes!</p>

<p>Whew found it within 10 minutes because in the history it had been
associated with a different parent record (and I had been searching for it
and its siblings by the parent&rsquo;s ID).  S-san had merged the parent
records, which never before needed to merge historical records, but I
guess now it does.  Poo.</p>

<p>Then she said something else was broken; she can&rsquo;t sort properly by a
certain field (which is cause it&rsquo;s not 3rd normal and the data has
gotten out of sync).  Dang, &ldquo;okay can you make a ticket in Redmine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh I forgot to tell you, Redmine isn&rsquo;t working.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Awwww man.</p>

<hr />

<p>On the app front, Tariq and I released Pongdemonium to all regions,
but App store is saying it&rsquo;s not available in Japan.  itunesconnect says
it is available in Japan.  What to do?</p>

<p>Yesterday I spent a few hours working on AB site; they basically want
a new login type for the frontend, so I need to restructure how the
logins are processed.  Basically I had put the email address in the R
table because only Rs can log in to the frontend, and we need to email
Rs from the backend.  But now Os can also login to the frontend, and I
don&rsquo;t want to check two tables (because it will soon be three or four
or 95) against login credentials.  So I&rsquo;m moving the login credentials
to their own table and will have a linking table tell what personas
this particular logged in person has.</p>

<p>I hope it will work.</p>

<hr />

<p>Another big change is allowing Rs to see items which had been
suggested, but are no longer available.  The original site design said
only things which are &ldquo;available&rdquo; shall be visible.  Oh, unless they
<em>used</em> to be &ldquo;available&rdquo; and were mentioned to the Rs at that time.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this wasn&rsquo;t a very difficult to change to implement.
It&rsquo;s almost done now; I just need to tweak the color which means &ldquo;no
longer available.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yesterday or maybe this morning I finished a relatively significant
change to the AB site.  Now they can edit some records which were
never meant to be edited, just logged&hellip;  but the logs are of
human-driven changes and sometimes they have errors which need to be
fixed, so they need to be fixed in the log as well.  Fair enough!</p>

<p>Then got another request to log one more thing in that log.  This
thing is only available in a many-to-many linked table, but
fortunately they only want the max value, so it&rsquo;s clear which one
should be logged.  Once I add it to the live site, they&rsquo;ll have 12
years of zeros in that field from not having logged it before.</p>

<p>got some pretty good shite done at work today. S and I have set up
weekly meetings and they&rsquo;ve been pretty productive. Today we closed 3
tickets right off the bat (she hadn&rsquo;t seen that I finished them during
the week) and probably closed a couple others today. There are still
some outliers I don&rsquo;t know how to solve yet, but generally speaking we
are making much faster progress than before (when I didn&rsquo;t have
meetings with her during which I can ask questions, usually some
variant of &ldquo;can you be more specific?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In other news, when I went to the conveni, I got a facetime call from
Yoshie, who (later) said she had been calling me back.  WTF?  I sure
didn&rsquo;t call her.  My call log looks like we called each other back and
forth which is wayyy fucked up.  I haven&rsquo;t called her for ages.  I
wonder if my phone is having a heart attack or of it was due to a
network problem or if 1337h4x0r5 did something.</p>

<p>Nah it&rsquo;s some fucked up apple shit. there are tons of hits for
&ldquo;Facetime ghost call&rdquo; Fuck apple man; I&rsquo;m leavin&rsquo; (as soon as this
phone dies or pisses me off enough) and ain&rsquo;t neva come back.</p>

<p>Oh, in other news, it&rsquo;s Fred&rsquo;s 35th bday soon and we&rsquo;re going to play
Portal as soon as we can figure out how to set it up on The Internet,
or &ldquo;hip hop&rdquo; as you kids call it.</p>

<p>Finished #1 above.  It turns out it was working, oops, nevermind.</p>

<h2 id="15-39">15:39</h2>

<p>actually #3 isn&rsquo;t done yet, but I&rsquo;ve done as much as possible for now.
It&rsquo;s weird.  There&rsquo;s a website which exists at t.example.com but it&rsquo;s
not shown in the list of DNS records at the example.com registrar.  I
guess there&rsquo;s another list somewhere which tells what to do with
t.example.com.  I&rsquo;ll ask Alfonzo tomorrow if my d.example.com doesn&rsquo;t
work by this time tomorrow.</p>

<p>Funny: Y left cause he explained everything he needed to explain.
Then S was translating it for me and I was like, &ldquo;well it works here&rdquo;
and she checked and it worked for her too.  She went upstairs to ask
Y, but he was gone.  I go, &ldquo;I bet he&rsquo;s at the conveni&rdquo; so we went
there and saw Y or a guy who looks just like Y reading magazines.  I
got a drink and we headed back to find Y walking up the stairs ahead
of us.  Waitaminute, if that&rsquo;s Y, then who was that?  And where was Y
all this time?</p>

<p>It really was a location joke!</p>

alternating classes in that timeslot and I expected (and prepared for)
one class, but the other class came because they had no lesson during
Golden Week.</p>

<p>Fair enough! I winged a lesson and overheard one guy saying he had had
fun. Great!</p>

<p>Today we had a meeting that we should have held some time ago!  It was
the first of what I hope will be weekly meetings. なちゃん translated
and we got a lot done, including translating some things that I hadn&rsquo;t
had translated before so couldn&rsquo;t do the work!</p>

<p>Hopefully we&rsquo;ll be aable to chew through the backlog of tickets and
they&rsquo;ll be happy and I&rsquo;ll feel helpful/productive/happy yay!</p>

<p>Finally got approval for a thing I did like 3 weeks ago, so I moved it
to the live server.  Then they were like, yeah but what about this:
it&rsquo;s not working.  and showed me the URL</p>

<pre><code>www.example.com/report/xml
</code></pre>

<p>um, yeah, that&rsquo;s because I told you it was</p>

<pre><code>demo.example.com/news/xml
</code></pre>

<p>It&rsquo;s on the demo server because you haven&rsquo;t approved it and it&rsquo;s the
news URL because that what you originally requested to be updated.</p>
