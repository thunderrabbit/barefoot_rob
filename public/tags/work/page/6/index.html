<p>Good lesson this morning with just two students.  We talked about
rental おっさん in Japan.  Interesting concept of renting old men
because they are older and presumably wiser.  They?  We?</p>

<p>Walked with Tariq from Akabanebashi to Shibashi while we talked about
future plans for our
<a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi">swipe game</a>. He found a
designer who can create excellent graphics.</p>

<p>Did not end up needing my computer, but I have my rolly bag so no
worries.</p>

<p>Rolled to Ginza Line and got back to my station for 411 yen, given
that I have a free pass from Shin Yurigaoka to Noborito.</p>

<p>Today Lin and I are at her sister&rsquo;s house, but they do not have strong
wifi so I cannot use Skype.  At least not in this quiet room.  Maybe
that is why it&rsquo;s quiet haha.</p>

<p>I do not have unlimited data on my phone, but I do have unlimited
calling, so I am doing a lesson via phone instead of Skype.</p>

<p>Headed to JB now soon; hopefully no big concern from the typhoon.  I

<p>But my train is nearly empty because apparently nobody came to work.
Or at least everyone left work early.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m just finishing work and heading home now.</p>

<p>Been working too much recently, but not enough to trigger carpal
tunnel issues again, fortunately.</p>

<p>Today for AB I nearly finished a report that AB wants to have
available.  I thought I could finish in 2 hours, but it has taken 6.5
so far.  fack.  I will tell them it has taken longer.</p>

<p>Today for JB I did my normal Wednesday schedule (Solid Square with
Ayano and them, then two kid lessons and two adult lessons in JB
office from 15:30 - 21:00).  Had a gap in the middle so went to Muza
for their ワンコイン 500 yen lunchtime concert.  Had a nice snooze
during the performance, a string quartet, which played for about 40
minutes.</p>

<p>I worked for JB at three different locations around Kawasaki Station
today, as I do every Wednesday, at Solid Square, SSC, and JB main
office.  Solid Square lesson went pretty well; we drew mind maps of
our favorite places and then said a few sentences about them.  Then I
had a break during which I Marco Poloed with Richard from ae911truth a
bit and then worked on AB, nearly finishing this ticket since it
received a bit higher priority at our last meeting.</p>

<p>SSC featured lunch with Tomoko and then she reminded me of M&rsquo;s
birthday yesterday and bought a present &ldquo;from me&rdquo; which I wrapped.
Then lesson with Tomoko and head out to JB (via bus cause it&rsquo;s kinda
raining) and I spent some time working on AB and nearly nearly got the
ticket finished.</p>

<p>Four JB lessons each Wednesday: two lessons with kids and then two
with adults.  New student in the kids lessons is pretty genki, and may
have a good effect on the others.  We had them write some letters N+1
times and then practiced language &ldquo;I have a _____&rdquo; using different
plastic fruit.  We had tried &ldquo;I have a _____&rdquo; and &ldquo;I want a _____&rdquo; but
they kept getting &ldquo;have&rdquo; and &ldquo;want&rdquo; mixed up, so I switched it to only
&ldquo;have&rdquo; because I remember not being able to distinguish the words for
library and post office for a long time because I had learned them on
the same day.</p>

<p>In second class I used the same fruit to lay out a fake city, hoping
they would enjoy giving directions with fruit as landmarks.  It did
not work as well as I hoped; they prefered playing various sports with
the plastic fruits (which I can understand, but was frustrating for a
bit).  They finally got into it a little bit, but then <em>really</em> got
interested with Kazu brought in his computer with an animated game
version of giving directions.</p>

<p>In the third class, we used past perfect(?) e.g. &ldquo;I have worked in _____
for ____&rdquo; and &ldquo;I have lived in _____&rdquo; because the language pattern
came up in their banter at the beginning of classes.</p>

<p>In the fourth class, they were not saying much, and I was getting
tired, so I invited them to tell me their favorite fairy tale in
Japanese.  They told me the story of Peach Boy.  Their version seemed
to be missing a lot of possible sub-plots; I wonder how it was
originally written.</p>

<h2 id="21-51-wednesday-06-june-2018-jst">21:51 Wednesday 06 June 2018 JST</h2>

<p>I have been writing this on the train from Yako to Tsudayama, and am
feeling super tired.</p>

<p>If I had my way, I would be magically transported home from here.
Thank god for Lin who usually picks me up from our station on
Wednesdays.</p>

<p>On Wednesdays, I wake up at 5am and leave the house at 5:45am so I can
get on a train that arrives in Noborito at 6:29am but leaves Noborito
at 6:57am.  That gives 58 minutes of sleeping time on the train
including both waiting and riding to Kawasaki.</p>

<p>Then lesson in Solid Square with Ayano, Takato, Yohei, Ai, and I
talking about reasons we (dis)like certain months or seasons.  A bit
challenging lesson because the students are at such different levels.</p>

<p>Then chatted for a long time with Christian at
<a href="https://www.japanese.io/">Japanese IO</a> about their upcoming features:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sharing</li>
<li>Listening</li>
<li>Automagic SRS</li>
</ol>

<p>Hopefully the site will support many people in learning Japanese.</p>

<p>Lunch with Tomoko at SCC and then briefly said HI to Liliko and Hitomi
(who work together) there before lesson with Midori (who works with
Tomoko).</p>

<p>Then to JB for two lessons with elementary school students, and two
lessons with adults from age 24 (or so) to 50 (or so).  These again
were challenging due to different levels.  I&rsquo;m kinda glad Misato could
not make it today.</p>

<p>Walked to the station with Chihomi(?) and Kaori.  Chihomi had just run
a half marathon this past weekend, and asked us abut our marathon
histories.  Mine is zilch, and I was surprised to hear Kaori
had/sometimes(?) runs 5km around Imperial Palace in central Tokyo.  8
times around for a full marathon.  haha yeah I ain&rsquo;t doing that!</p>

<p>Train and then rode home with Lin who usually picks me up at the
station on Wednesday nights.  She had just gone to see
<a href="https://www.amma-rainichi.org/english/">Amma</a> (and Paola, who is
likely to leave Japan for a while) with our neighbor Mai.</p>

<p>Great day at a park, but there were briars in the grass.  Got to talk
to Aaron for quite a bit and catch up with Francine who invited him.
My student Misato attended and joined our little outing to find a
<a href="https://www.geocaching.com/seek/log.aspx?LUID=f5e6ca10-abc0-4bb3-aa8f-8a7b1a366c96">nearby geocache</a> which she was actually the one to find.</p>

<p>I napped for 30 minutes in the tent that went largely unused.</p>

<p>12 or so peeps in attendance; cozy and fun!</p>
