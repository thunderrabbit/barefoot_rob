<p><strong>8:57pm Wednesday 10 April 2013</strong></p>

<p>Pretty good day; our new server on AWS had been barfing hourly errors like, &ldquo;the MySQL server has gone away&rdquo; or &ldquo;could not connect to mySQL server&rdquo; even though 99.n% of the connections were fine.  We had been using MySQL 5.6, and certainly I may not have had it set up right.  Once I instantiated a server with 5.5 (and reverted the DB to MyISAM tables for those with FULLTEXT indices), it has worked perfectly fine.</p>

<p>Today Jonas started tweaking the front page of AB new frontend; it was fun for me to hit reload on the test server throughout the day and see it taking shape.  All that CSS and design shit still eludes me.  Or maybe I just have no interest.</p>

<p>I wrote a new class that will just be some static functions that do custom queries of the DB.  I might look into writing functions that live in the DB, but I&rsquo;m not sure if it will really make a big difference.  I was seeing 0.0003 seconds per (cached) query in my class; that should be enough for now.</p>

<p><strong>9:41pm Wednesday 10 April 2013</strong></p>

<p>I looked into STORED FUNCTIONS and was like no way ferget that, and then I remembered oh <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/create-view.html">MySQL VIEWs</a> are what I want.  Nice.  Compiled queries so they&rsquo;re even faster.  0.0002 seconds nice.</p>

<p><strong>10:55am Saturday 30 March 2013</strong></p>

<p>Came in to work today to move AB from server which we didn&rsquo;t totally control to one which we control a lot more.  We still don&rsquo;t have to touch the hardware, but now we have sudo access as needed.</p>

<p>The move was smooth; the longest part was waiting for DNS to update.</p>

<p>because Monday is a holiday, I figure my brain will need some notes to reload its current state.  Some notes on my desk point to a URL that will result in the notes here, spewed out by code in progress:</p>

<pre><code>in code above line 64, we need to fill in the default email 
from site_text factory (into array shown below)




Array
(
    [renter_id] =&gt; 23
    [to_name] =&gt; doug e fresh
    [to_email] =&gt; doug@e.fresh.net
    [subject] =&gt; These properties may be of interest
    [body] =&gt; data from site_text factory goes here
    [from_name] =&gt; Rob Nugen
    [from_email] =&gt; robnugen@company.co.jp
)




above is info from set 1
</code></pre>

<p>after save, display the email_set template or an error message. this will be the initial data entry for admin (but is now broken because template is trying to read data from DNE variables). we HAVE NOT sent the email yet</p>

<p>when admin enters data, need to figure out how to deal with new record (I think the sent_email class will create new record just fine)</p>

<p>now once data is POSTED by admin, we will be in section above marked with HAPPY NEW MAYAN CALENDAR</p>

<p>The AB project has classes I created a year ago, at which time were the next iteration of our in-house framework.   Six months ago we created the <em>next</em> iteration, which handles multi-lingual sites a bit more elegantly.</p>

<p>So now the AB project&rsquo;s front end will be using the new classes while the back end is still on the old classes.  But the front end has some classes in the back end so they can make updates to the public facing site.  I wonder how long it&rsquo;s going to be before I say &ldquo;bah&rdquo; and upgrade all the classes to the same iteration.   I&rsquo;d do it now, but I&rsquo;m not sure how I&rsquo;d get all the historical data updated to the new style, all while keeping the site humming along.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll be moving soon, though haven&rsquo;t yet confirmed our new place.  Hopefully it will be near The Pink Cow in Roppongi, so I&rsquo;ll be able to hang out there a bit more easily.</p>

<p>In other news, I&rsquo;m getting the reporting engine a bit more completed.</p>

<p>So sad that it&rsquo;s all closed source, but I just pushed the first version of the reporting system to our client&rsquo;s admin site.  It uses backbone to do most of its goodness, including: add fields for filtering, add fields for output, run the report, and copy the report for more reporting fun!</p>

<p>So I asked this question on SO:</p>

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13598834/detect-select-status-of-options-in-a-multiselect-with-backbone-picky">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13598834/detect-select-status-of-options-in-a-multiselect-with-backbone-picky</a></p>

<p>There may be a slick way to do it without <a href="https://github.com/derickbailey/backbone.picky">Backbone.Picky</a>; it&rsquo;s curious that Derick hasn&rsquo;t touched Backbone.Picky in 6 months (since May 2012).</p>

<p>Today at work I stopped trying to convert my code into a <a href="https://marionettejs.com">Marionette</a> app; I just don&rsquo;t seem to have enough smerts to do it yet.  I&rsquo;m gonna try again tomorrow, making a Marionette app from scratch.  Well, from a semi blank js slate, so hopefully it will go a bit more easily.</p>

<p>The code I&rsquo;ve got so far uses <a href="https://backbonejs.org">Backbone</a> to do some pretty sweet ajax compared to writing all the ajax queries in <a href="https://jquery.com">jQuery</a>.  The page lets the user create WHERE clauses for a report.  Buttons along the top have table names on them.  Selecting one (hmmm maybe I should make them a select list, cause there will be several(?) other tables added)..
Selecting one tells the page to create a dropdown list of most of the fields in the table.  Selecting a field from the dropdown list converts the View to the selected field name, an appropriate operator dropdown, and an empty text field for the user-supplied value.</p>

<p>Each of these are the components of my WHERE clause.  Each change is saved automagically to disk, so reloading the page reloads all the elements in their same states.  I don&rsquo;t yet have a GUI for grouping fields for OR and AND within the WHERE clause, but the backend supports this through something I&rsquo;ve called groups.  Each same-numbered group are all joined with ORs and then distinct groups are connected with ANDs.</p>

<p>Tomorrow&rsquo;s page will allow the selection of fields for the SELECT portion of the query.  It&rsquo;s this page that I intend to create as a Marionette app from the start.</p>

Greetings Robert,

My name is M____. Through a very convoluted path of
rumors and faxes I found your website by request of my Japanese wife.
Journal entry 12:19 am JST Friday 26 September 2003 is making its
rounds! Apparently there is a pissed off mother who ready your
message and interpreted it as unprofessional.... unbelievable.

I've been in Japan eight years, and it still baffles me how bent out
of shape things can get over small things like celphones and
translater devices.

Anway, if it's worth anything at all....

I FEEL FOR YOU!!

Read your resume before writing you. I admire your objective, and
respect your background and activities. I hope we can open a
dialogue. I don't plan on being in Japan too much longer, but you
seem to be a very interesting person so I just couldn't resist writing
you.

Here is a little about me.. don't have a website to share with you,
journal or resume.... but this article kind of gives you an idea of
me..

* redacted * (they were 404 anyway)

Anyway, please this email between us...

Best Regards, M
