<p>Interesting to talk about the Meisner effect and flux pinning at SCC
today.  I have always assumed I understand the meaning based on the
English presentation, but I felt a bit unsure when I was breaking it
down in detail for Yasu as he was practicing his explanation of the
same.</p>

<p>My understanding: when a superconductor is below its critical
temperature it pushes (almost) all magnetic flux out of itself.  This
is the Meisner effect, apparently named after a scientist named
Meisner.</p>

<p>Impurities in the superconductor mean some lines of magnetic flux
pierce the superconductor and the superconductor &ldquo;remembers&rdquo; the
strength and direction of those lines and pins itself to them.  This
is called flux pinning, apparently not named after a scientist.</p>

<p>What is this &ldquo;memory&rdquo;?  I guess while the material is not a
superconductor, magnetic flux pierces it like any other non-ferrous
material.  As it becomes superconducting as it passes below its
critical temperature the flux already passing through it are&hellip; what
exactly?</p>

<p>(( I wonder if electrical resistance in normal conductors is what
causes the magnetic fields???  hmmm ))</p>

<p>Today I wanted to write an email to AB as a status update on the
upgrade I am doing for them.  The update has been taking longer than
expected, both in terms of the amount of work required and the amount
of time I have not been able to spend on it.</p>

<p>To write the email, I wanted to make sure my plan will work.  I wanna
get their system upgraded to latest LTS version of Ubuntu, 18, Bionic
Beaver.  I have written a lot of tests while upgrading their old PHP
system, but I could not get the test framework to work on Ubuntu 18.
Sigh.</p>

<p>So the email that I hoped I could write in an hour has taken 4 hours
and still ain&rsquo;t finished.</p>

<p>Well, I missed the first day of the month by 3 minutes.  I have been
zoned out in front of my computer longer than 3 minutes so oh well.</p>

<p>Logged 6 hours of work and noticed how much longer it will take.  At
10 minutes per line, and 400 more lines to change that&rsquo;s 4000 minutes
(hopefully max!), but that is just to get rid of a single singleton.</p>

<p>I am tired enough that I cannot do the math in my head.  4000 minutes
/ 60 = 65 hours..  dang that has got to be too much.  5 minutes per
line and we get 32 hours.</p>

<p>Anyway, the main point is that I feel shame for mis-guessing how long
it would take.  But I gotta let AB know the estimate.</p>

<p>I think I will start up their new DB server and use the existing web
server and new DB server for a bit, and then spin up new DB server
with Ubuntu 18.</p>

<p>JB got me 8 hours of lessons at BP over the 4 Thursdays in June.  This
was the 3rd lesson, during which we practiced taking taxis, ordering
in a restaurant, and something else.</p>

<p>Yoko M wasn&rsquo;t there, but she will be back next week.  Yoko N
volunteered a couple of times to go first!</p>

<p>I got a seat on my preferred train.  I arrived in just enough time,
though it&rsquo;s reasonable to say I could have ridden more slowly to be
safer (down the big-ass whooo-hooo hill).</p>

<p>Lin said she had an &ldquo;unbelievably hard day at work today&rdquo; so I look
forward to listening and hopefully helping her sort out her feelings
on the whole thing.  New job, new system, steep learning curve; I can

<p>Today I showed students in Akihabara the website and snippets for
<a href="https://www.marbletrack3.com/">Marble Track 3</a>.  They were like
&ldquo;waow&rdquo; etc.  I love the project and felt a bit guilty for taking up
a significant amount of class time with it.  We have had lessons for
years though, so I don&rsquo;t think they will mind.</p>

<p>Four lessons at SCC today.  One was shorter than expected due to a
(hopefully small) medical emergency.  Third lesson on the third floor
featured discussions of the other three lessons and hearing they
students really enjoy my passion for the topics.</p>

<p>Back at SCC today with four student for 30 minutes each.  Hitomi came
in for Lily, who could not come.</p>

<p>I bought
<a href="https://hanayama-toys.com/product/cast-arrows/">Cast Arrows</a>, a new
Hanayama puzzle because I could not solve it in 20 minutes.  (not that
I can solve most of them in 20 minutes, but this one <em>looked</em> like I
could solve it and then I was like &ldquo;woah that&rsquo;s not going to work???&rdquo;
because one piece was jjuustt slightly too big to fit through a gap.
Dang, I thought they were all the same size.</p>

<p>Today was the last lesson with Sweets Attendants.  (Their office is
being shut down at the end of this month, but I am leaving next week
for three weeks overseas.)</p>

<p>I met Tomoko at CPK at 11am and helped her carry pizza to their office
where we had a party, including candy I bought from the conveni ond
3F.</p>

<p>The party was fun, but afterward I unfortunately let myself get
sidetracked into dealing with some work related Excel spreadsheet
crap, but got it sorted out by moving the spreadsheet into Google
Sheets, where I can use the <code>=FILTER()</code> function.  Why can&rsquo;t I use
such a function in LibreOffice?</p>

<p>That took an hour out of our 4 hours allotted, but then I got to chat
with Midori for a bit about her plans.  At the end of our time
together, I went to the front desk and received a small white wooden
box with four drawers that I plan to use for Marble Track 3 parts.
Tomoko had apparently brought it to the office and apparently does not
want it anymore.</p>

<p>We stood to say bye to a bunch of guys leaving the conference room
right around the time that I also had to go.  That had me trapped a
bit longer than I wanted, during which time I wanted to reiterate they
can ask me for references or whatever they need for job search.  After
the conference room cleared out, I headed out and Tokyo-waved while
walking out the two sets of glass doors.</p>

<p>Gosh I am going to miss the sweets party attendants!</p>
