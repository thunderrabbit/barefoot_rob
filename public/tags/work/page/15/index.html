<p>I set my alarm to wake up early this morning so I can get some work
done while it&rsquo;s not too hot in my room.  When my computer gets hot, it
gets slow.  (Basically because it is old and the kernel task starts to
go crazy and take all the CPU.)</p>

<p>Tonight I talked about Marble Track 3 during the lesson with GG.  The
next streaming video I do will be for them because 6 minutes before
the lesson started, I realized I had purchased the wrong type of
extension cable (the clerk tried to tell me but I did not understand
what she said.  180 yen wasted and a new wire to get stuck in some
fish&rsquo;s gill because the shop does not accept returns. bah), and Mayumi
encouraged me to go get it sorted.  Had to moe joe with two people
because I did not know the word for female connection is the same in
Japanese. bah.</p>

<p>Anyway, thanks to them, I now have an extension.  Labeled as a meter
long, but really only like 90cm.  bah.</p>

<h2 id="21-52-thursday-29-june-2017-jst">21:52 Thursday 29 June 2017 JST</h2>

<p>oh!  I am wrong.  It is exactly a meter long within the tolerences I
can measure with Lin&rsquo;s tape measure.</p>

<p>Third lesson today was good; some of the students seemed to really
enjoy the cadence practice we did, focusing on matching the natural
native-speed rhythm of my speech.  Finally I have found something that
kinda gets their attention.  Mental note duly noted.</p>

<p>Maybe I will try it with my next class, but I kinda doubt it will have
the same effect.</p>

<p>The old code was this:</p>

<pre><code>$search_id = uniqid(UserAuthentication::getUserId());
</code></pre>

<p>Now it is this.</p>

<pre><code>switch ($report_id) {
    case '2':       // I have no idea how to fix this one
    case '5':       // contact edit page knows nothing of V2-style indices
    case '9':       // contact edit page knows nothing of V2-style indices
    case '10':      // uses `u` in query.  See SELECT * FROM `defined_reports` WHERE `dr_id` = 10
    case '11':      // uses `t` in query
    case '13':      // can probably fix if remove `u` from `query` SELECT * FROM `defined_reports` WHERE `dr_id` = 13
    case '16':      // can probably fix if remove `u` from `query`
    case '17':      // can probably fix if remove `u` from `query`
    case '18':      // can probably fix if remove `u` from `query
    case '19':      // can probably fix if remove `u` from `query
        $search_id_version = 1;
        $search_id = uniqid(UserAuthentication::currentUserId());
        break;
    default:
        $search_id_version = 2;
        $search_id = &quot;v2-&quot; . uniqid(UserAuthentication::currentUserId());
        $search_id_existed = 0;
        break;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am actually pretty glad I put it in code instead of
the DB because now at least I have notes regarding why each one is
here, and I have a sense of where to start looking to fix them.</p>

<p>I guess I can do this:</p>

<pre><code>switch ($report_id) {
    case '2':       // I have no idea how to fix this one
    case '5':       // contact edit page knows nothing of V2-style indices
    case '9':       // contact edit page knows nothing of V2-style indices
    case '10':      // uses `u` in query.  See SELECT * FROM `defined_reports` WHERE `dr_id` = 10
    case '11':      // uses `t` in query
    case '13':      // can probably fix if remove `u` from `query` SELECT * FROM `defined_reports` WHERE `dr_id` = 13
    case '16':      // can probably fix if remove `u` from `query`
    case '17':      // can probably fix if remove `u` from `query`
    case '18':      // can probably fix if remove `u` from `query
    case '19':      // can probably fix if remove `u` from `query
        $search_id_version = 1;
        break;
    default:
        $search_id_version = 2;
        break;
}

$search_id = &quot;v&quot; . $search_id . &quot;-&quot; . uniqid(UserAuthentication::currentUserId());
$search_id_existed = 0;
</code></pre>

<p>Because the version tester just looks for &ldquo;v(%d)+-&rdquo; at the beginning,
so old style uniqids like <code>115952d2ee60c79</code> and <code>v1-115952d2ee60c79</code>
will respond as type 1 ids.</p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>

<p>But I think really I am just losing my mojo for programming.</p>

<p>Just finished teaching and am now seated on a balcony walkway thing
overlooking the empty water fountain in middle of Solid Square.</p>

<p>The lesson featured drills on two different patterns.  One student was like &ldquo;I went
to shopping&rdquo; so we practiced variants of that pattern.  Another
student arrived and started talking about TV so we practiced a pattern
like</p>

<p>______ is a _______ about _______ _____-ing ______ ____ __  _ _  _ _</p>

<p>and eventually made a game:</p>

<pre><code>This is a TV show about young adults living together in Hawaii.
</code></pre>

<p>Chika got it immediately: &ldquo;Terrace House&rdquo;</p>

<p>After 3 rounds, Chika ended up with 3 points vs everyone else having 0
points.</p>

<p>I am on the train now in Shinjuku.  How is it they have more
super-express trains that express trains?  I guess they know what they
are doing and it works out for me, so there&rsquo;s my answer.</p>

<p>Anyway, I texted CB 44 minutes after our normal meeting time.</p>

<pre><code>[6/19/17, 1:44:12 PM] me: Do you want to have a meeting today?
[6/19/17, 2:25:36 PM] CB: I am so sorry, we don't really have any task right now.
[6/19/17, 2:26:09 PM] CB: I should've told you early.
[6/19/17, 2:33:56 PM] me: Okay no problem.
[6/19/17, 2:34:27 PM] me: Let me know if you have any questions during the week
[6/19/17, 2:34:53 PM] CB: Ok, thank you!
[6/19/17, 2:36:34 PM] me: I am going to work from home then, so Skype me if you need anything.
[6/19/17, 2:36:40 PM] me: have a great week!
[6/19/17, 2:37:02 PM] CB: Thanks!

<p>Today is the big day to move CB to new servers.  I reset the master
password after it became apparent that the normal user cannot dump the
DB.  CB was still not able to run mysqldump, so they ended up just
getting a snapshot from their AWS RDS instance.</p>

<p>I hope hope hope hope the transition goes smoothly.  Today I have been
giving some advice but not actually <em>doing</em> anything (except reset the
master password) because I have not been made privy as to what exactly
they want to do with the data.  Curiously enough, I will be glad when
I no longer get requests to support CB changes.  I hope hope hope
their new sysadmins can interpret their requests more easily, and
explain why certain things are not doable.</p>
