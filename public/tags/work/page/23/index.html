<p>My group lesson had only one student; I suggested <a href="https://newsinlevels.com">https://newsinlevels.com</a> and
<a href="https://breakingnewsenglish.com">https://breakingnewsenglish.com</a> as ways she can practice extensive reading.
There are probably some free sites that are actually geared toward ER,
but I don&rsquo;t have their domains memorized.</p>

<p>Surprise! That turned out to be my last lesson there.  I had mentioned
to them that it&rsquo;s a bit far for me to travel and then boom they got a
new teacher.</p>

<p>Sweet; I&rsquo;ve got my refactored code nearly complete.  I just need to
snag a copy of the number of records.  I know the data already exists
in DataTables; I just need to pick it up from there or maybe I already
have it server-side somewhere.</p>

<p>Lesson with A this morning was good; one-to-one because C is out of
town.  Not sure about K.</p>

<p>Lessons with guides today were fine.  Six back-to-back lessons in 3
hours about fun sciency topics.</p>

<p>Lesson with GG was great; we played an &ldquo;a / the&rdquo; game using coins.  Y
got a bit confused and I was suprised about that.  I think it might
have been because M seems to have fibbed, but I let it go.  If I&rsquo;m
correct about what happened, the core problem is that the lesson
content was too difficult.  Bad teacher.</p>

<p>Worked at home all day today, basically on Ansible.  I found Ubuntu
16.04 is available on AWS as an AMI, so I switched my Ansible
playbooks to use it, and then installed git, apache2, php, and
apache-php-fpm (I think) because it seems to be needed to get Apache
to let PHP tell it what to serve.</p>

<p>I subbed for Matt again this week.  Each class had one more student
than last week, so I guess that was a good sign.  I talked about neti
with one of the students who was suffering from allergies.</p>

<p>We imagined luxurious vacations in both classes. &ldquo;They will fly to
Italy to eat pizza&rdquo; and &ldquo;they would fly in a hot air balloon&rdquo; are
examples of the grammar structures used in each class.</p>

<p>Bluh computer work kinda sucked today; I spent 5 hours on one thing
and 3.5 hours on a different thing and made almost 0 progress on
them.  The second thing was futzing around with .htaccess file, and
for 2.5 of the 3.5 hours it actually wasn&rsquo;t being read. <em>facepalm</em> I
needed to AllowOverride All in the Apache2 directives&hellip;  but do I
want to do that on live server?  I wonder if it&rsquo;s already on our live
server?  Anyway, once I got Apache to actually look at the file, I
made an inch of progress, but nothing like what I had hoped.  Blarg.</p>

yesterday, knowing that I have to wake up earlier than normal to teach
a lesson for Matt who is at home in UK at the moment.  Train is at
6:29, so I plan to leave the house at 6am.</p>

<p>After teaching in the morning, I pretty much spent all day playing
with Ansible.  I now have a vagrant installation that sets up ansible,
git, and
emacs on a vagrant box on my local machine which creates an ssh
keypair (half of which I manually copy to bitbucket).  I run setup and
it pulls in a git repo and runs setup on that, which asks for an
ansible-vault passphrase to unlock my AWS keys and gives me ansible
playbooks which I can run to set up VPC + subnet + internet gateway on
AWS, launch an ubuntu instance in the subnet, and install git on it.</p>

<p>Next steps will be to set up git the way I like (.aliases for gitl,
gitd, gits), install apache2 (to replicate existing box), set up a
couple of websites, including redmine.</p>

<p>At that point, (I will have to get from backup my redmine data, and
<em>then</em>) I will have replicated a box on AWS with Ansible!  Thank you,
Travis, for the initial idea, and thank you, Ansible team, for
Ansible, and thank you Justin for helping me set up Ansible on
vagrant!

<p>I hereby promise to release the repos once I&rsquo;ve cleansed all the
references to my workplace! (hopefully someone will still find it
useful by then!)
from Ansible by then hahaha)</p>
