<p>I woke up at 4am with no alarm, and then actually got up at 4:26.
Chatted with Jason and Jimmy for a second before getting to work.</p>

<p>Work included getting Ansible to create directories for a SB website on
AWS.  Basically I am tweaking the playbooks and roles from AB website
to work on SB website.  I need to make them a bit more generalized,
but to a degreee, I think they are pretty good.  There is a bit of
non-3rd Normal stuff (the expected deploy script is named after the
website) but I think that is reasonable.  Oh, maybe I can make the
name deploy_backend.sh in the role, and then change it to
deploy_sitename_backend.sh on the server.</p>

<p>Okay I am going to snooze a bit on the train.  Oh, today I am subbing
for Matthew near Zavas.  Yesterday may have been Chika&rsquo;s last day in
class.  I bought Country Ma&rsquo;am strawberry cookies for her.</p>

22:51 me: It is best if you decide

22:52 me: They make sense to me, and I think they will make

<p>We got it sorted in the end.  Same decision as in the cafe.</p>

<p>Mutsumi introduced a new style lesson format where the guides sit down
together with me instead of just having individual lessons.  Hopefully
this will help them improve listening skills by listening to other
people have conversations in English.</p>

<p>I showed mt3s.robnugen.com to Miyako and Ayaka.  Miyako showed me pics
from her trip to the US with Haruka.</p>

<p>Funny talking to Scotty on Marco Polo; he kept not being able to hear
me until I was like &ldquo;okay bye&rdquo; or &ldquo;okay I hope you could hear it that
time!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I am headed to Kawasaki to support the guides in the English versions
of their work.  Then GG lesson in Akihabara.</p>

<p>Quick online I-group today; everyone checked out so it was just me and
my coach near North Zulch, Texas.</p>

<p>Not actually sbs.net, but yes actually AWS.  Using Ansible again,
thanks to Travis having suggested it to me.</p>

<p>Right now as I write this entry, <del>AWS</del> <ins>my wifi in this
cafe</ins> is being slow to realize that my
VPC is already created.  Not sure why, as it was fast a moment ago.</p>

<p>Yep it just timed out.</p>

<pre><code>The error was: ssl.SSLError: The read operation timed out
</code></pre>

<p>Previously, I was getting</p>

<pre><code>Invalid type for parameter AvailabilityZone, value: None
</code></pre>

<p>When actually I was sending no value at all.  Someone else reported
<a href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/31905">ec2_vpc_subnet subnet creation fails due to az parameter validation error</a>.
Thanks, OP!</p>

<p>Yay, now it works because I specified <code>az: &quot;&quot;</code></p>

<pre><code>- name: Create subnet
  ec2_vpc_subnet:
    vpc_id: &quot;{{ vpc.vpcs.0.id }}&quot;
    cidr: &quot;{{ vpc_subnet }}&quot;

<pre><code>TL;DR:  Would you like donuts delivered to your place on Monday morning Nov 20th?

details: Story time!  Today I was inexplicably late for class which
happens to be near your place.  I told them I would get donuts before
class next week.  I found a donut place, checked Google Maps to see
how to get to the class... and the track goes right by your house!

I don't want to bother you guys on a work day, but I do want to come
say HI with donuts if it's convenient for you!

The class starts at 12:00 so I would have to leave at 11:30 at the latest.
