<p>Only reason I am not sure rests in the fact that I had to switch to
LetsEncrypt &ndash;staging certs, so now my browser does not trust the
site.  As far as I can tell, though the SSL is installed properly.
Yay!</p>

<p>I may switch to my domain for testing again tomorrow.</p>

<p>Uh, yeah that&rsquo;s not going to work.  <code>{{$article-&gt;title}}</code> is obviously a placeholder.</p>

<pre><code>[2/2/17, 12:20:07 PM] Rob Nugen: thank you.  I got it, but I need
    a little bit of time to test.  I need to change the part that says

[2/2/17, 7:15:47 PM] caught-in-middle: Thank you for checking. Ok, hope it goes smoothly.
[2/3/17, 10:35:18 AM] Rob Nugen: Okay I've moved this online



[2/3/17, 12:13:38 PM] caught-in-middle: Thank you.

[2/3/17, 12:14:29 PM] caught-in-middle: hmm could send us screenshot or something?
[2/3/17, 12:14:58 PM] Rob Nugen: a screenshot of what?
[2/3/17, 12:15:11 PM] caught-in-middle: some evedence
[2/3/17, 12:16:08 PM] Rob Nugen: clients-website,com/rss_fb.php
[2/3/17, 12:16:58 PM] Rob Nugen: all the titles are correct.
[2/3/17, 12:17:15 PM] Rob Nugen: search for 'set', 'title' on that link and they are all there.
[2/3/17, 12:23:51 PM] Rob Nugen: On the source of this page clients-website,com/ja/news/63...
    all the titles are correct
[2/3/17, 12:24:01 PM] Rob Nugen: I don't see php or fb_ anywhere on the source of the page.

[2/3/17, 12:24:28 PM] Rob Nugen: do you know where the data is coming from on that screenshot?
[2/3/17, 12:25:21 PM] caught-in-middle: That is a screenshot of google analytics.

[2/3/17, 12:25:43 PM] caught-in-middle: I don’t know if you can see the page
[2/3/17, 12:25:54 PM] Rob Nugen: I can't, unfortunately,

[2/3/17, 12:29:42 PM] caught-in-middle: Of course
[2/3/17, 12:29:51 PM] caught-in-middle: Ok, thank you,
[2/3/17, 12:30:08 PM] Rob Nugen: no worries
[2/3/17, 4:06:20 PM] caught-in-middle: The reason why Boss has changed the code is to display the titles
    correctly on Google analytics. If you haven’t check Google analytics, please create your account.
    There are many other companies trying to be able to check the page views of Instant articles on Google
    analytics. Please search references and FAQs.
[2/3/17, 4:10:53 PM] Rob Nugen: I have a Google analytics account, but I don't have access to Client-website
    analytics.
[2/3/17, 4:11:27 PM] Rob Nugen: In order to give myself access to Client-website analytics, I need to
    change the tracking code, which will limit your access to see the analytics.
[2/3/17, 4:12:34 PM] Rob Nugen: There may be a way for you to add my account to view your analytics,
    but I'm not familiar with how to administer that service.
[2/3/17, 4:13:15 PM] Rob Nugen: I believe if you add rob@monkey.net then I'll be able to see them
[2/3/17, 4:20:53 PM] Rob Nugen: I have access now; thank you
[2/3/17, 4:23:05 PM] caught-in-middle: Could you test the code checking Google analytics?
[2/3/17, 4:24:31 PM] Rob Nugen: Yes, but first  I don't know how to get the same report you sent as a screenshot this morning.
[2/3/17, 4:24:40 PM] Rob Nugen: can you help me see the problem?
[2/3/17, 4:31:03 PM] caught-in-middle: Of course.

[2/3/17, 4:31:26 PM] caught-in-middle: it’s client-website site - realtime - contents
[2/3/17, 4:32:23 PM] caught-in-middle: Page titles of Instant articles are messed up
</code></pre>

<p>Ticket 2978</p>

<pre><code>On Google Analytics, I noticed these news items had title '{{$article-&gt;title}}' which matches the code suggested by Google, I guess

/ja/news/63...
/ja/news/62...
/ja/news/64...

Instead of waiting for more items to show up on Google Analytics,
I went through all the published items on Facebook Instant
articles page. The following items also had '{{$article-&gt;title}}'
as their title

List of titles of articles with incorrect analytics code
List of titles of articles with incorrect analytics code
List of titles of articles with incorrect analytics code
List of titles of articles with incorrect analytics code
List of titles of articles with incorrect analytics code
List of titles of articles with incorrect analytics code
List of titles of articles with incorrect analytics code
List of titles of articles with incorrect analytics code
List of titles of articles with incorrect analytics code
List of titles of articles with incorrect analytics code
List of titles of articles with incorrect analytics code
List of titles of articles with incorrect analytics code
List of titles of articles with incorrect analytics code
List of titles of articles with incorrect analytics code
List of titles of articles with incorrect analytics code

I corrected all of the above articles manually on Facebook instant article page

This item had title including 'php echo $fb_item_title;'

/ja/news/65...

I have also corrected this item. I believe the incorrect title must
have been read by Facebook during the time I activated the update of
the website.
</code></pre>

<p>Now, how to fix <em>that</em>, I don&rsquo;t know, but it kinda made me angry that
they were like &ldquo;did you test the code?&rdquo;  When it&rsquo;s clearly the case
they manually edited all those articles incorrectly.  I never deployed
code with <code>{{$article-&gt;title}}</code> in it.</p>

<p>Travis replied to my plea and gave some more resources, which I hadn&rsquo;t
looked at before.</p>

<pre><code>Here is a current guide that covers your target OS:

https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu-16-04

As for Redmine, I noticed that Docker has an official Remine repository:

https://hub.docker.com/_/redmine/

I see that it is based on Debian, but that is not too different from
Ubuntu.  Perhaps the Dockerfiles might be helpful reference, and you
can always execute a shell in a container and check out the install.

<p>I need some luck today; I hope I can figure out Facebook&rsquo;s Instant
Articles.  Specifically, figure out why they won&rsquo;t reload articles
that have been updated in the RSS feed (with an expiry date in the
past), after I changed the GUID of the article, after I changed its
canonical URL.</p>

<h2 id="12-57-monday-23-january-2017-jst">12:57 Monday 23 January 2017 JST</h2>

<p>Okay, the main thing I determined:</p>

<p>FB won&rsquo;t complain if we use a subdomain for the RSS feed, but it will
silently ignore it if it hasn&rsquo;t been approved.</p>

<p>Steps to fix</p>

<ol>
<li>Turn off authentication for the subdomain (optional)</li>
<li>Get it authorized for use</li>
<li>Turn authentication back on (optional)</li>
<li>Use it as the Development RSS feed for Instant Articles</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="16-06-monday-23-january-2017-jst">16:06 Monday 23 January 2017 JST</h2>

<p>Okay so it looks like we just have to figure out how to replace all
&lt;br&gt; tags with &lt;p&gt;&amp;lt/p&gt; tags.  I&rsquo;ll just run a little regex and
whoops no that didn&rsquo;t work, well how about..  oops no that won&rsquo;t work,
maybe if we just scream</p>

<p>FACEBOOK Y U NO BR TAGS?????</p>

<p>I know I didn&rsquo;t say I could definitely finish.  At the start of this
year, they were like, &ldquo;oh god the competition has ABC!  We need ABC
too!&rdquo; yeah well ABC has been available for 6 months.  Asking me to
spend 8 hours to catch up to what they&rsquo;ve done in as long as 6
months is not something I would have said I could do.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m creating a git repo of Ansible playbooks that I can post online to
see if someone can figure it out.</p>

<p>now it&rsquo;s 3:29.  fuck this I&rsquo;m going to bed.</p>

<p>for some reason I can&rsquo;t figure out what command added the database config file that I want on my new server</p>

<p>I have some old copies of the new server and on one of them the database is configured properly.  But when I ran through (what I thought were) the same steps again, the database is not configured.</p>

<p>tomorrow I&rsquo;m going to restart all the servers I have, grab copies of their .bash_history files and try to figure out if one of the servers had an extra step added or something.
good night</p>

<h2 id="09-38-sunday-15-january-2017-jst">09:38 Sunday 15 January 2017 JST</h2>

<p>For some reason, my Ansible playbook to install redmine suddenly stopped creating  <code>/usr/share/redmine/config/database.yml</code> with the correct values.</p>

<p>Desired:</p>

<pre><code>ubuntu@ip-10-0-165-169:~$ sudo cat /usr/share/redmine/config/database.yml
production:
  adapter: mysql2
  database: redmine
  host: localhost
  port:
  username: redmine
  password: U28m6gPfYrquLXOn9Sq6CSx3lgxOYwM0kajuy
  encoding: utf8
</code></pre>

<p>Actual:</p>

<pre><code>ubuntu@ip-10-0-204-194:~$ sudo cat /usr/share/redmine/config/database.yml
production:
  adapter: sqlite3
  database: /var/lib/dbconfig-common/sqlite3/redmine/instances/default/redmine_default
# host: localhost
# port:
# username: redmine_default
# password:
  encoding: utf8
</code></pre>

<p>Using <code>git log -SU28m6gPfYrquLXOn9Sq6CSx3lgxOYwM0kajuy</code> I determined
when I had put the password in place, and therefore the max I would
have to go back in time to find the source of the problem.</p>

<p>So, it turns out that I incorrectly used <code>become</code> when storing values with <code>/usr/bin/debconf-set-selections</code></p>

<p>As I&rsquo;m writing this, I realize it&rsquo;s probably of zero use to anyone, but this line was the problem:</p>

<pre><code>- name: Redmine | Set debconf vars redmine root passwd
  shell: echo redmine redmine/instances/default/mysql/admin-pass password &quot;{{ mysql_root_password }}&quot; | /usr/bin/debconf-set-selections
    become=true

- name: Redmine | Set debconf vars redmine/instances/default/db/app-user
  shell: echo redmine redmine/instances/default/db/app-user string &quot;{{ redmine_db_login }}&quot; | /usr/bin/debconf-set-selections
    become=true

- name: Redmine | Set debconf vars redmine app-pass passwd
  shell: echo redmine redmine/instances/default/mysql/app-pass password &quot;{{ redmine_db_passwd }}&quot; | /usr/bin/debconf-set-selections
    become=true

- name: Redmine | Set debconf vars redmine db types
  shell: echo redmine redmine/instances/default/database-type select mysql | /usr/bin/debconf-set-selections
    become=true

- name: Redmine | Set debconf vars redmine db name
  shell: echo redmine redmine/instances/default/db/dbname string &quot;{{ redmine_db_name }}&quot; | /usr/bin/debconf-set-selections
    become=true
</code></pre>

<p>Replacing with these lines fixed the problem:</p>

<pre><code>- name: Redmine | Set debconf vars redmine root passwd
  shell: sudo echo redmine redmine/instances/default/mysql/admin-pass password &quot;{{ mysql_root_password }}&quot; | sudo /usr/bin/debconf-set-selections

- name: Redmine | Set debconf vars redmine/instances/default/db/app-user
  shell: sudo echo redmine redmine/instances/default/db/app-user    string  &quot;{{ redmine_db_login }}&quot; | sudo /usr/bin/debconf-set-selections

- name: Redmine | Set debconf vars redmine app-pass passwd
  shell: sudo echo redmine redmine/instances/default/mysql/app-pass password &quot;{{ redmine_db_passwd }}&quot; | sudo /usr/bin/debconf-set-selections

- name: Redmine | Set debconf vars redmine db types
  shell: sudo echo redmine redmine/instances/default/database-type select mysql | sudo /usr/bin/debconf-set-selections

- name: Redmine | Set debconf vars redmine db name
  shell: sudo echo redmine redmine/instances/default/db/dbname  string  &quot;{{ redmine_db_name }}&quot; | sudo /usr/bin/debconf-set-selections

<p>Right now I&rsquo;m in a conveni across from GG class in Akihabara (formerly
Akibahara).  I&rsquo;ve just walked here (in about 25 minutes) from the
imperial gardens, during which time I talked to Chuck from online
I-group.</p>

<p>Soon I&rsquo;ll teach GG&rsquo;s lunch lesson for whoever usually teaches it.
It&rsquo;s great because they are largely self-directed; we just talk about
the latest news or whatever they want to discuss.</p>
