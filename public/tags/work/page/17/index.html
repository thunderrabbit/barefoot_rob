<p>Moe Joe.</p>

<p>CB was like &lsquo;um where are the images in our app?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Turns out the app source hardcodes the image server domain name
instead of reading it from the API the app uses.</p>

<p>Spent 1.5 hours on phone with AWS support trying to get our domain
pointed to CBs new image server.  Ended up doing it at DNS level
because I could not get redirects to work from the server.  I guess
this way is better though, because now I can be pretty certain nothing
will be hitting the old server since DNS no longer points to it.</p>

<p>This is the first time AWS support wasn&rsquo;t able to solve my issue in a
30 minute phone call.</p>

<p>TL;DR: wasted a lot of time today.</p>

<p>Wall of crap:</p>

<p>I somehow confused myself and my vagrant VMs.  The big change I made
was to recreate my <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa</code> keys in my management box.  That
meant I could not connect to the other VMs until I put the public key
in their <code>.ssh/authorized_hosts</code> file, which I did, but then I could
not deploy the sites without giving the new key to bitbucket, and then
I ended up destroying and recreating a VM because for some reason the
&ldquo;exact same&rdquo; (*) deploys that worked before were not working because
they were being run as ubuntu instead of vagrant..  wait what?  How
could they possibly have worked before?  wth is going on fuckit and I
(archived and) wiped the box to recreate it, but <em>still</em> had problems
with the wrong user being used, and <em>then</em> I realied that on top of
all this, when I <code>vagrant ssh ab</code> to get to the ab box from my host, I
was being logged in to the mgmt box.  ffs I have wasted hours on this
so I am now starting new VMs from scratch (after downloading latest
Trusty64 from hashicorp (slower than Christmas here at the office for
some reason (between 57k/s and 200k/s)) and latest VirtualBox and
latest guestadditions so hopefully the mount thing will be fixed this
time.</p>

<p>(*) not exactly the same</p>

<h2 id="19-06-monday-08-may-2017-jst">19:06 Monday 08 May 2017 JST</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s only up to 64% downloaded so I am going to cancel the d/l and
head home.</p>

<p>After upgrading it to Ubuntu 14, I split the FS box into two, and put
one on CB&rsquo;s AWS account so they have control over it.  (<em>cough</em>) and
pay for it.  The AB version we still pay for, but the load is much
lighter.</p>

<p>While trying to fix the backup process, I destroyed the database by
overwriting with data from April 20th.</p>

<p>Had a good cry, and now am restoring the data from a 1GB backup file.</p>

<p>(It&rsquo;s this file that I guessed would be troublesome in a restore
process, so I wanted to break it up into bits.  Now we get to do the
restore starting with this file.)</p>

<p>Thank goodness it&rsquo;s Golden Week.</p>

<p>I contacted AWS support at 11:02am, and now at 11:40 the restore is in
progress.  Thank goodness for DS&rsquo;s calm and understanding
demeanor&hellip;. (plus understanding of the system!) to help me get going
quickly.</p>

<p>Pretty much got everything sorted.  I never got the old AB VM to have
connectivity again, but my new AB VM is in better shape than the old
VM ever was:</p>

<p>The new VM</p>

<ol>
<li>can send emails</li>
<li>can easily have deploys target specific branches</li>
<li>uses domain names that differ from production by a single character (.cojp vs .co.jp)</li>
<li>uses Ubuntu 14</li>
<li>is fully deployed via Ansible</li>
</ol>

<p>and that last item means if I lose my physical computer, I can pretty
quickly recreate my development environment, at least as far as that
VM is concerned.</p>

<p>Hooray for losing connectivity to that old VM!</p>

<p>Well, I have recovered <em>nearly</em> to the point that I was 24+ hours ago
before killing connectivity to my VM.</p>

<p>I tried restoring the old VM, but didn&rsquo;t get it working.  It&rsquo;s a
non-issue at the moment.  I have a new VM to which I can connect from
my host (allowing SublimeText2 (Registered) to save files to it), and
from a sibling guest VM which provisioned the new VM using Ansible.</p>

<p><em>Eventually</em> I will consider using Packer to do the provisioning, but
I shall leave that for after I get my current servers all on
newer version of Ubuntu.</p>

<p>TL;DR: <a href="https://www.packer.io/">https://www.packer.io/</a></p>

<p>Travis gave a fantastic reply to my tale of disconnectivity.  I am
going to dive in to Packer for a few units of time, and then try to
restore connectivity to my old VM, and then try to finish installing
site on my new VM, and then try to do the update I wanted to do
yesterday morning!</p>

<h2 id="09-43-saturday-29-april-2017-jst">09:43 Saturday 29 April 2017 JST</h2>

<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s install Packer!  Yay!  We can do so with brew.  But first
let&rsquo;s get brew up to date.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>$ brew update</p>
</blockquote>

<p>worked okay.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>$ brew upgrade</p>
</blockquote>

<p>is working, but apparently cooking my CPU, mostly to make Python 2 and
3.</p>

<p>I thought <code>brew update</code> would update the packages, and <code>brew upgrade</code>
would upgrade itself, but it seems to be the other way around.
Anyway, I intended to do both; I just did not think it would take so
long.. nearly all the time units available for Packer!</p>

<h2 id="09-59-saturday-29-april-2017-jst">09:59 Saturday 29 April 2017 JST</h2>

<p>Wow. <code>brew upgrade</code> completed, with these lines near the end of the
output:</p>

<pre><code>Upgrading boost --c++11
&lt;snip&gt;
🍺  /usr/local/Cellar/boost/1.64.0_1: 12,630 files, 404.4MB, built in 14 minutes 2 seconds
</code></pre>

<h2 id="10-09">10:09</h2>

<p>Okay, back to installing Packer.</p>

<pre><code>brew install packer
</code></pre>

<p>See that took like 5 seconds.  I was hoping for maybe 50 seconds to <code>brew upgrade</code>.</p>

<p>Haha I just read they consider this an &lsquo;alternative&rsquo; installation method.  I could have just downloaed a binary.</p>

<p>I read the items under

brain. Nothing on my computer except ~/<projects>/packer/README.ROB</p>

<p>Last night AB was like &ldquo;hey we cannot send emails.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They got a 500 error because I forgot to enable mcrypt to create
passwords for new users.</p>

<p>Enabled mcrypt and manually fixed some shit that didn&rsquo;t work due to
the 500 error.  Got everything sorted today and then ready to work but
denied because</p>

<p>the local VM in virtualbox does not have access to the internet.  So I
switched it to Bridged Adapter and all that, but still not access.
Fuckit.  Switched everything(*) back to how it was, and still no access.</p>

<p>(*) apparently not everything</p>

<p>damn.</p>

<p>Well, my box is behind the times anyway because it&rsquo;s Ubuntu 12 whereas
live server is now using Ubuntu 14.</p>

<p>So now I am trying to get Ansible to spin up a local server on
Virtualbox for me.</p>

<p>Starting here, cause I could not find anything else that seemed
remotely helpful.</p>

<p><a href="https://atlas.hashicorp.com/geerlingguy/boxes/ubuntu1404">https://atlas.hashicorp.com/geerlingguy/boxes/ubuntu1404</a></p>

<p>$ vagrant init geerlingguy/ubuntu1404; vagrant up &ndash;provider virtualbox</p>

<pre><code>Vagrant was unable to mount VirtualBox shared folders. This is usually
because the filesystem &quot;vboxsf&quot; is not available. This filesystem is
made available via the VirtualBox Guest Additions and kernel module.
Please verify that these guest additions are properly installed in the
guest. This is not a bug in Vagrant and is usually caused by a faulty
Vagrant box. For context, the command attemped was:

set -e
mount -t vboxsf -o uid=`id -u vagrant`,gid=`getent group vagrant | cut -d: -f3` vagrant /vagrant
mount -t vboxsf -o uid=`id -u vagrant`,gid=`id -g vagrant` vagrant /vagrant

The error output from the command was:
</code></pre>

<p>$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest</p>

<pre><code>Installing the 'vagrant-vbguest' plugin. This can take a few minutes...
Installed the plugin 'vagrant-vbguest (0.13.0)'!
</code></pre>

<p>Well okay the box is running, but I do not see how to connect to it,
much less from a sibling VM in Virtualbox.</p>

<p>Back when I first started messing with Vagrant and/or Ansible, I found
a Vagrantfile that would spin up multiple boxes and let them all
connect.</p>

<p>Smartagent, where was that tutorial?</p>

<p>Ah crap, you don&rsquo;t exist yet.</p>

<p>Yes yes, something like this

<p>Found it.

<p>Now I have this gem</p>

<pre><code>(1..1).each do |i|
  config.vm.define &quot;ab&quot; do |node|
      node.vm.box = &quot;ubuntu/trusty64&quot;
      node.vm.hostname = &quot;ab&quot;
      node.vm.network :private_network, ip: &quot;10.0.15.2#{i}&quot;
      node.vm.network &quot;forwarded_port&quot;, guest: 80, host: &quot;808#{i}&quot;
      node.vm.provider &quot;virtualbox&quot; do |vb|
        vb.memory = &quot;256&quot;
      end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>But dangit it keeps not being able to mount the directory /vagrant
inside the VM.</p>

<p>I am going to reboot my host machine and cross fingers and pray and
shake my head when nothing changes when it all comes back up.</p>

<h2 id="17-29-friday-28-april-2017-jst">17:29 Friday 28 April 2017 JST</h2>

<p>Rebooted, put laundry in wash, ate a banana and some nuts.</p>

<h2 id="18-07-friday-28-april-2017-jst">18:07 Friday 28 April 2017 JST</h2>

<p>Upgraded Vagrant, Virtualbox, vagrant-vbguest, but still cannout mount /vagrant.  I&rsquo;m going to move on.</p>

<p>Fantastic.  Got my mgmt box talking to local new box via these handy instructions: <a href="https://sysadmincasts.com/episodes/45-learning-ansible-with-vagrant-part-2-4">https://sysadmincasts.com/episodes/45-learning-ansible-with-vagrant-part-2-4</a></p>

<p>Moe Joe.  Everything was going fine until install mysql.</p>

<pre><code>dependency problems prevent configuration of mysql-server:
mysql-server depends on mysql-server-5.5; however: Package
mysql-server-5.5 is not configured yet.

<p>Thanks to this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/32620242/194309">https://stackoverflow.com/a/32620242/194309</a> for getting
past that error.  (Needed to give more than 256MB memory to the
machine.  I gave it 512MB and it worked.)</p>

<pre><code>      node.vm.provider &quot;virtualbox&quot; do |vb|
        vb.memory = &quot;512&quot;
      end

<p>Downloading data from S3 now.</p>

<p>Had to import a few by hand and skip some of the big historical
tables, but hooray I now have the frontend site working to the point
that it shows the site and I can log in.</p>
