<p><p>I&rsquo;ve been working diligently for the past 4.5 days on this SAS stuff,
and my SAS brain is getting pretty smart (I think).  Yesterday I wrote my
most complex SAS program ever - it merges datasets, creates datasets
dynamically, updates the datasets on disk according to user preferences..
 Good nerdy computer stuff.</p>

<p><p>There are a couple of things I still haven&rsquo;t been able to figure out -
some aspects of writing a new row to dataset, and keeping track of
iterations&hellip; simple in concept, but I just don&rsquo;t know the syntax.</p>

<p><p>My boss came back today after 4 days of being gone.  I just showed him
the results of my work.  What I wanted was, &ldquo;holy shit this is quite
impressive considering I just threw your ass into this SAS shit.&rdquo;  Instead
he pointed out some mispellings, talked about shifting things around on the
screen&hellip; entirely superficial crap that anyone could fix.  I&rsquo;ve been
focusing on the guts of this thing.</p>

<p><p>I asked him about the couple of thingies that I&rsquo;m not sure how to do.  I
showed him my code, and helped him get acquainted with it.  I wanted him to
just be able to show me the simple syntax of the counter, and give me an
example of writing to disk the way I need to.  Instead he pointed out
variable naming convention stuff (had a good reason in this case (var name
shows up in logs and it&rsquo;s good to know what project it&rsquo;s from)), and
poopooed my use of lots of macros (SAS version of procedures in Pascal).
 He is rewriting some/part/all of one of my programs.</p>

<p><p>I know my brain is smart.  I&rsquo;ve learned hella SAS these past 4 days.  I
am just thankful that I&rsquo;ll still get paid for my time.  I just wanted
ego-payment too.</p>

<p><p>Thanks for listening!</p>

<p class=date>3:30pm CST Friday 17 March 2000</p></p>

<p class=note>(transcribed from my diary)</p>

<p>Today I'm working on a big ol' SAS project and I've drwan out flow charts on my big sheets of paper.  (big = 25.5" X 11" (from Scholars' Community at UH)).

<p>Work flow is good; project is due mid next week.  I'm working on it tomorrow too and maybe Sunday.  Missing Centex (Ultimate tourney in Austin) to work.

<p class=date>6:20pm CST Friday 17 March 2000</p>

<p>I'm still at work.  I'm 3/4 of the way through typing up 1 of 8 SAS programs.  They are all pretty well flow charted and I pseudocoded the first one and now am 3/4 of the way done coding it.  Have not tested it at all yet, but I'm greatly borrowing from old (not so old - first version of same project) SAS code.

<p>This project allows peeps to come in with username and password, forces them to change their password, then according to their status etc, let them do different things on their portion of our site.

<p>All database driven, though I put in a bit of Javascript to verify password1 = password2 when they enter them newly.

<p>Pretty much been working on this all day - flowcharting it all out an' shit.

<p>Tonight Wende and I are going to Maggie's house to paly games and munch fish sticks and cole slaw and just play play play.  We'll stay overnight there and then both come back to work-reality in the morning.  10am to 6pm.  Yay!  Lots of cashola for new house!

<p class=date>7:10pm CST Friday 17 March 2000</p>

<p><p>Doh!  Well I finished typing it all in, but it just crashes the server.  I&rsquo;m outta here for play-party tonight!</p>

<p><p>ACK</p>

<p><p>All day I&rsquo;ve been doing great coding here at work (all day after KTRU)
and then I was asked to reboot a machine.  I rebooted it properly I
thought, but turns out I mis-chose one of the startup options.</p>

<p><p>Ack ack ack ack</p>

<p><p>30 minutes in mental agony standing behind my boss as he tried to figure
out how to fix it.  I had no idea how to help, AND I&rsquo;m supposed to be
somewhere at 6:30.</p>

<p><p>I called my 6:30 group and told them I&rsquo;d be late; they were okay, but it
didn&rsquo;t fix anything here.</p>

<p><p>Ack ack ack</p>

<p><p>So he fixed it temporarily, and now I&rsquo;m asked to figure out why it broke
in the first place.  The registry is corrupted, and some environment
variables have no values.  causally related?  or just stupid microsoft?</p>

<p><p>With Love anyway&hellip;
<br> - Rob</p>

<p><p>Welp, Wende and I looked at the little house across the street.  I
thought it was cool, but she found the bedrooms to be too small, and it had
an extra garage thingy converted to a dog/cat grooming salon.  She felt it
would be wasted space, and realistically, she&rsquo;s right.</p>

<p><p>We requested from Diane our credit ratings, to see what kind of loan we
could get and stuff like that.  Haven&rsquo;t heard back from her yet.</p>

<p><p>And we decided we need more cashola.  So I&rsquo;ve requested to increase my
hours at work, and my bosses are ecstatic at the idea!  Tomorrow I will
discuss with them the possibility of working full time and therefore going
to salary instead of hourly, and being added to health insurance.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ll have to figure out what salary I would like.</p>

<p><p>Part of this need for cashola stems from me overdrawing my checking
account today.  Wende bailed me out with $300, which I intend to pay back
on the 15th, but dang it pisses me off that I did that so stupidly.
 Actually it was paying or this here website that threw me off.  I got 3
months free web hosting and then prepaid $215 for the year and I totally
didn&rsquo;t record it in my thingy.  Doh!!!!</p>

<p><p>Today at work I reviewed two CDs with the entertaining help of Jason.
 We found Slotek&rsquo;s CD <em>7</em> dark mysterious stuff.  Jason said it made
him think of dead people playing music.</p>

<p><p><em>soulsharks</em> by gitbox! (or is it <em>gitbox!</em> by
soulsharks?) was crap.  depressing lyrics with bad singing.</p>

<p><p>And last <em>the great indoors</em> by star ghost dog - just girl-rock,
and I wasn&rsquo;t too impressed.  At least it wasn&rsquo;t angry-girl-rock.   Holly
likes girl-rock much more than I; I may give it to her tomorrow to review.
 They sounded a lot like Cranberries to me.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ve been working on some SAS programming today.  Learning a lot of
stuff&hellip; this is the first SAS code / SAS database project that I have
written essentially from scratch.  I&rsquo;m fairly pleased and impressed with
this first effort!</p>

<p><p>Have a great and lovely day!</p>

<p><p>Heh.  That&rsquo;s funny.  I just realized I wrote February for the previous
entry instead of March.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m at work now, designing a desk addition thing that will allow me to
clear of the cluttery crap from my desk.  Papers, books, pictures, hard
drive, fork, plate, water bottles, grocery bag, CDs, glue stick, floppy
disks, telephone, binder, tools, paper paper paper all clutter my desk now.
 I believe that if I had more place to put it all, I could keep the desk
surface less covered in crap so I could actually use my desk for things
like writing or coloring or something.</p>

<p><p>With help from my dad, I&rsquo;ve got a design for a shelf thing using one
sheet of <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inch plywood.  I&rsquo;ll have to carefully plan the shelf so I can
get it all cut and stuff at Home Depot and then just put it together here
at work.  We&rsquo;ll see how that goes!</p>

<p><p>Today Wende and I are likely to see Whole Nine Yards again!  This time
with Maggie-Molly-John-Will.</p>

<p class=date>9:01pm CST Thursday 2 March 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Today I basically worked all day.  Woke up crazy early and decided therefore to do laundry!!  Two great things about that:</p>

<p><p><ol>
<li>My laundry is now complete!
<li>I found Wende&rsquo;s Sacagawea dollar!
</ol></p>

<p><p>I had left her new dollar coin in my shorts pocket.  Now we know
what they will look like after a nice laundering.  Not brilliant
shiny, but still golden in color.  Very nice.</p>

<p><p>So inspired was I about the coin that upon arrival at work, I
visited <a href="https://www.usmint.gov">www.usmint.gov</a> and
purchased two 1999 Susan B. Anthony proof coins, and two 2000 proof
sets, including all the quarters from this year!!!  Wait&hellip; 2000 or
1999 proof?  Hmmmm.. now I don&rsquo;t remember.</p>

<p><p>Oh well.  Anyway, I ordered lots of cool coins!</p>

<p><p>I was anti-impressed with the shopping cart on their site.  It kept
erroring when I tried to add items to the cart, so I called customer
service and ordered over the phone, asking them to waive the S/H fee
that they wanted to charge since it was not a web-based order.</p>

<p><p>After that I work work worked on SAS stuff, the primary language
used at my work for database stuff.  It&rsquo;s a somewhat sloppy high level
language, but is fairly effective for what we need to do.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m picking it up pretty easily I think.</p>

<p><p>Wende and I munched at Subway and that&rsquo;s been the most excitement
I&rsquo;ve had all day!</p>

                        <p>Today I read Microsoft&rsquo;s installation manual for Win NT 4.0 Server.  Not
particularly informative, but it gave some good information.  Then I got
the wonderful phone call from Wade at the computer place.  &ldquo;Your
computers are ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wow!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thankful that he asked, &ldquo;would you like us to put the wheels on your
server?&rdquo; because otherwise I woulda just driven out there in Scott, my
little Camry and said, &ldquo;load &lsquo;em up!&rdquo; to a chorus of laughter, &ldquo;in that
little thing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instead I asked, &ldquo;just how big is this server?&rdquo;
I now suddenly had a vision of it being 5 feet tall with upper and lower
cooling fans, a walk-in see through front panel, and big wheels on the
bottom.
He said it wasn&rsquo;t <em>that</em> big, but I probably would want a truck
if I could get one.</p>

<p>So I got Wende&rsquo;s truck.  Said HI to her at Container Store and switched
keys.  Drove to the computer place, got 3 computers, drove to work,
couldn&rsquo;t get in.  The place was locked up and Wende had my keys.</p>

<p>Doh!</p>

<p>Back to Wende&rsquo;s work, grabbed my work keys, leaving her my car keys, and
went back to work.  Unloaded all 3 machines and monitors in two trips
using our dolly and began to set one up.  I started with the smallest
one first.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll keep this part short:  The end result is I couldn&rsquo;t get the UDMA66
IDE controller/cable/drive to work.  So I had to use the 33 IDE.  I
spent over an hour until I made this decision, and by that time, Wende
was off work and it was time to eat!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll work more on the computer(s) tomorrow.</p>

<hr />

<p>After mexican food (I had chicken burrito with avacado; Wende designed
her own combination meal) at La Jaliscience, the high-end mexican dive
within 2 blocks of my house, we drove to Sterling McCall Toyota to drop
off Scott for his 120,000 mile checkup.  He&rsquo;s 2.5 thousand miles early.</p>

<p>Now to bed early so I can go to work and then tomorrow TOMORROW begins
the new two digits!!!!!!</p>

<p>With Love

<p>Wow.  3 days till Christmas; 10 days till 2000!!</p>

<p>Today at work I finalized purchase orders for three
machines!!  This is a first for me on this scale, and
with this level of precision piece by piece
construction.</p>

<p>The data server will be a dual PIII 500 mhz machine
with 256meg ram, four 9.1gig hard drives (scsi ultra
2, 10,000 rpm) arranged into a RAID 5 array with a hot
spare, single channel raid controller that can handle
15 physical drives, 8 gig tape backup, two NIC <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>100</sub>
cards, dual power supply in a big tower case with 12
drive bays, etc.</p>

<p>The web server will be dual PIII 600 mhz, 256 meg ram,
one 9.1gig hard drive, 8 gig tape backup, two NIC
<sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>100</sub> cards, etc.</p>

<p>These two machines will be their own little private
network, and also connected to our main hub.</p>

<p>The third machine is to replace a currently used
workstation that is getting pretty old and slow - it
can&rsquo;t even handle Win 98 quickly.  We&rsquo;ll get a PIII
500mhz, 128meg ram, 18.2 gig hard drive, one NIC
<sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>100</sub>, etc.</p>

<p>AND I&rsquo;ll get to install NT 4.0 on all these machines!</p>

<p>Rosa is the gentle and polite woman who cleans up our
building each evening.  Talking to her today, we
wished each other happy holidays and stuff.  She is
just learning English, but tries hard to communicate.
I told her I learned a tiny bit of Spanish while in
Costa Rica last year, and somehow we got to the
subject of learning languages, but not knowing the
&ldquo;bad words.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some day,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am going to learn the bad
words. The <em>really</em> bad words.&rdquo;</p>

<p>=====================</p>

<p>Got home, watched the Simpsons with Spot purring
contentedly on my back.</p>

<p>Got a great package in the mail!  All the present I
ordered from Bits and Pieces for Maggie, Molly, John,
Will, Marcel, Fred and myself.  (I&rsquo;m not sure what to
get Wende).   So now Wende and I have just eaten
dinner at her house and we&rsquo;re about to wrap presents.
She works at The Container Store, so has cool rolling
scissors, cool tube shaped ribbon, and plain ol&rsquo; flat
wrapping paper.</p>

<p>I logged 11 hours today, 9 of which go to DSL switchover.</p>

<p>Was not able to get the mail server happy.  We can receive email, but
not send it; the mail server thinks our new IP addresses are hackers
trying to use our server as a mail relay.  (This is a technique used
to spam people; our server won&rsquo;t allow it.)  I don&rsquo;t know where to add
our IP addresses and say, &ldquo;hey!  we have new IPs!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I also couldn&rsquo;t get our printers&rsquo; IPs changed.  After I changed all
the computer IPs, I realized I had forgotten the printers.  I couldn&rsquo;t
telnet to them because the IPs were different; so I called Brian who
suggested connecting it directly to my computer (I&rsquo;d have to change my
IPs back to old IPs first) but I couldn&rsquo;t get that to work.  Pooh.</p>

<p>Sweet and Wonderful Wende brought dinner over at around 9pm; we ate
and talked for an hour then she slept on the couch until I could no
longer think coherently.  Bed bed bed.</p>

                        <p>Yay!</p>

<p>Great fun at work today; got to learn some new SAS stuff.  I pretty much
don&rsquo;t like the language - it&rsquo;s not strictly structured like C, sloppy
variable typing and sloppy function calls.  but I can handle it!</p>

<p>Oh, and the best thing of all- I asked if I could be paid today for the
past week of work instead of waiting until next official payday, and Karla
was like, &ldquo;no problem!&rdquo;</p>

<p>YAY!  I need the cashola to cover the cost of the water altar and stuff.
 And to buy some happy gifts for my homies!</p>

<p>See ya!</p>
