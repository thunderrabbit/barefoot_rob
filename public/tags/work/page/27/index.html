<p>I woke up early (compared to when I went to sleep) because I had some
ideas for doing automated testing.  I guess there&rsquo;s no harm in adding
some CSS classes to make finding things easier.  I may even add a
click all that are unselected option if I can&rsquo;t figure out how to do
it with CasperJS.</p>

<p>But first I gotta repair a script which runs every 5 minutes via cron.
It doesn&rsquo;t run on my local machine, so I missed it after updating the
DB.</p>

<p>By far the large part of my time today was spent in a bit of a panic
trying to figure out why the AB site was acting horribly wrong.  Not
even the most basic thing was working: logged in users couldn&rsquo;t sort
nor even filter the properties.  Yikes stripes!</p>

<p>I was really close to a major upgrade which was alllllmost working on
my local system.  I got it finished and then spent over an hour
testing, and then push the whole thing to live site.</p>

<p>I checked the live site and the problem was still there!  Holy crap
crap crap crap what is going on?????</p>

<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll tell ya: I had wiped a record associated with my login
account, so a JOIN was returning null.  I recreated the record and the
site worked fine.</p>

<p>Whew.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t actually know how the record was removed, but I didn&rsquo;t see any
other users who were affected, so I&rsquo;m going to ignore that pesky
little detail for now.</p>

<p>But.</p>

<p>All of this inspired me to look again at testing systems.  I have
looked at Selenium more than three times and have never been able to
properly install the thing, much less get started with tests.  But
today I found two awesome test systems: <a href="https://ghostinspector.com">https://ghostinspector.com</a> and
<a href="https://casperjs.org/">https://casperjs.org/</a></p>

<p>Ghost Inspector is suuuuper easy to use.  I was able to set up a few
tests on the live site in about an hour.  The most difficult part was
figuring out how to compare two values on the page.</p>

<p>Do it like this:</p>

<p><a href="//b.robnugen.com/journal/2016/ghost_inspector_comparing_values_2016-01-05_at_3.01.19_AM.png"><img src="//b.robnugen.com/journal/2016/thumbs/ghost_inspector_comparing_values_2016-01-05_at_3.01.19_AM.png" alt="Ghost Inspector can compare values" /></a></p>

<p>Casper takes a bit longer to work out how to write the tests, but it
has the awesome advantage of running locally, so it can access my
websites running on my machine.</p>

<p>Bah the CB website is acting up.  I happen to have been in Harajuku so
I&rsquo;m heading in to the office now.</p>

<h2 id="21-25-tuesday-29-december-2015-jst">21:25 Tuesday 29 December 2015 JST</h2>

<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know what caused the problem, but everything seems to be
working again.  It happened last night for a few hours and again
tonight for a few hours, so I guessed it was simply being overloaded
by traffic, but Google analytics says it&rsquo;s not particularly swamped
right now.</p>

<p>Alfonzo assumed it was an expired SSL cert, but that doesn&rsquo;t seem to
be it either, because that wouldn&rsquo;t cause problems every 24 hours.</p>

<p>But the good news: I now have the .pem to log in to the server so I
can better troubleshoot things and blah blah.</p>

<p>Satomi uploaded the final image(s) they needed to upload before the
end of the year and we walked to the station together after closing up
the office.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re kinda planning to have a take-a-party at her place to try and
fix her old iMac, which might just need a new hard drive..</p>

<p>Today:</p>

<p>was able to get my e-money back from Toho Cinemas after I accidentally
bought Japanese dubbed Star Wars tickets last night.</p>

<p>got some end of year fixes done for CB site, including those
which they want to have done by Friday.  yay!</p>

<p>finished a ticket for AB site, though it&rsquo;s not completely tested yet.
(gotta test code note written in Hakyll, ya know)</p>

<p>am about to go see Star Wars VII</p>

<p>Meeting with Satomi was fine as usual. yay!  We got her inbox filters
fixed so she actually sees emails sent from redmine when I do updates;
because those emails were skipping her inbox (and redmine folder/tag)
she didn&rsquo;t see when I finished things and so didn&rsquo;t approve them until
the next meeting.</p>

<p>Now they can preview things and I removed the unused sharing options
(Mixi, Google+, Pinterest) from the (demo) site.</p>

<p>This morning I worked a bit on Apple TV app, but couldn&rsquo;t figure out
how to set the <code>preferredFocus</code> to the correct view.  I see what the
docs say, and I tried to click and drag the thing in the interface,
but it simply didn&rsquo;t work.  Bah.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll skip it for now and move on to the next bit.</p>

<p>Then at CB I increased the images on two of the site indices to be 90
by 90 pixels instead of 70 by 70.  It took a teeeeny bit of CSS
tweakin&rsquo; to make them look okay, but it wasn&rsquo;t too bad.</p>

<p>Then for AB, I tried updating the datatables plugin, but it still
doesn&rsquo;t look right in Chrome.</p>
