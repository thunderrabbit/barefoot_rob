<p>Actually have gotten three (3) meetings done online: Prentiss and Ari
helped with Mankind Project Tokyo; Ari said he will write some stuff
for either
<a href="https://www.meetup.com/ManKind-Project-Tokyo/">Mankind Project Tokyo Meetup</a>
or <a href="https://tokyo.mypowercircle.org/">My Power Circle</a>.  Oriane and I
checked in with each other on our respective projects.</p>

<p>Planning to ask which inkan I can use for my personal seal today;
maybe I will go do that now on my way to work at TY.</p>

<p>Tears were apparently shed by one of the students at SCC; she is
scheduled to present tomorrow and found out today that her
presentation is going to be different than what she expected/practiced
for.  Yikes stripes I wish I could help more, but I suggested some
simplifications that will hopefully make it easier.</p>

<p>Nice to see setting up SSL certificates for Apache 2 on Ubuntu is
pretty easy.  They even automagically set up a cron job to renew the
certificate after two months.  See <code>/etc/cron.d/certbot</code></p>

<p>I had a problem for a minute because one .conf file had a domain and
an alias in it.  I ran certbot for the aliased domain and told it to
go ahead and force https, but then that broke the main domain (which
was the main domain) by forcing SSL <em>and</em> using the certificates for
the test domain.</p>

<p>So I split the .conf files into two different files (This is a
technique called WET (Write Everything Twice)) which might suck for
future me, but now AB is available via https.  Noice!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll write future me a note.</p>

<pre><code>Hey future Rob

testadmin.ab.com exists as a separate file to ensure the correct SSL
certificates are used for the domain.

Feel free to wipe the domain from the map; I don't use it very often.

<p>Today I spent the morning setting up a test image upload page to see why I can&rsquo;t get the main page to work via https.</p>

<p>Frustrating: the test page is working fine.</p>

<p>Working, I  was distracted from online integration group, and then zoned to SCC and found out the manager is leaving soon.</p>

<p>Now in Akihabara about to go to GG lesson.</p>

<p>We have an image server behind cloudfront.  Cloudfront can serve
everything via https when using its subdomain.  But using our own
domain with https isn&rsquo;t as easy as I would like.</p>

<p>Running Lets Encrypt on the server, I get an error like the https
request was not allowed.</p>

<p>So I created a certificate with AWS Certificate Manager and told
Cloudfront to use it, but I do not see how to tell the server to use
it.</p>

<p>Bah.</p>

<p>I am on track to finish my todo list today on
<a href="https://complice.co/?r=pgej30cphu">Complice</a>.  I got my AB work
complete, though there is the possibility they will want one more
change on it.  I am prepared for work tomorrow and now just gotta
write this journal entry, studying Japanese, work tonight, Japanese
lesson tonight with Mel, ..</p>

<p>I watched episode 6(?) of Kakegurui.  They did not have the subtitles
added yet, but I could understand the overall meaning because the
acting is so over-the-top, plus explained visually (given that it&rsquo;s a
tv show)</p>

<p>I signed up for beeminder but am not sure if/how/when I will use it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m on break now at JB, listening to the other class, where the
teacher&rsquo;s Japanesey English always kinda bugs me.  But the students
seem happy and have been in the class for a long time.</p>

<p>This morning thinking about C who apparently took my investment advice
before bitcoin blew up.  She quit her job and is overseas now.
hahahah nice!</p>

<p>Then working on AB, getting three alleged issues sorted.  Only one was
actually valid, but we had a chat on the phone and got them sorted.  I
fixed the one issue and then explained it to Kai who happened to come
by on her way to work.</p>

<p>Hi Kai!</p>

<p>Then went to SCC and talked to Tomoko and Midori for an hour each, not
counting lunch with Tomoko (Midori and Yuko chose not to join).</p>

<p>Zoom here to JB and two kids classes, the first of which went by
easily thanks to Patrick&rsquo;s (neverending) Day of Week game, and the
second of which went easily due to my shopping game.</p>

<p>Was barefoot between Sh and SCC.  Socks now, but will be barefoot on
the way home tonight.</p>

<p>Sigh.  Worked on AB all morning and then they were essentially like
&ldquo;yeah we don&rsquo;t like it.  Go back to the version that didn&rsquo;t function,
but looked pretty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t understand their priorities, but I switched it back.</p>
