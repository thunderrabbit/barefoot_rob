<p>On Mondays for the past year or more, I have been waking up at 5am on
Mondays to work at IL for an hour from 8am to 9am.  Today we talked
about the new fish market in Toyosu, and how at 40 hectares, it is 1.7
times larger than the fish market that was in Tsukiji (which I never
visited during the fish auctions).</p>

<p>The days of visiting those fish auctions are over; one of the
bugs/features of Toyosu location is tourists are not allowed in the
same room as the auctions.  I don&rsquo;t really care one way or another,
but I imagine it&rsquo;s somehow better to more easily keep the place
cleaner.</p>

<p>After that lesson I ate two bowls worth of raw salad buffet at .RAW
for 900 yen, and then taught at UG.  Akari, Masa, Eri, Ryuya, Taka,
Shinji, and Kazu were there.  No Kenji today.</p>

<p>I am headed home now because it seems no one else will attend the
<!-- mixed gender --> meeting tonight.</p>

<p>I did MT3 livestream today, but have not made time to add an episode.</p>

<p>I attended online men&rsquo;s circle this morning, but was distracted with
emails.</p>

<p>Kevin&rsquo;s website is throwing memory errors, probably because old
version of site needs upgrading.  I contacted his provider about
getting it upgraded.</p>

<p>I am on the train headed to SCC, but forgot to bring my tea cup so I
probably have to use a paper cup (or go without tea).</p>

<p>No students in my lesson today so I am glad I brought my computer so I
can do some work for AB.  I am continuing with the Modernization of my
Legacy PHP application based on the book described at

<pre><code>Modernize Your Legacy PHP Application
Get your code under control
in a series of small, specific steps.

<p>In addition to simplifying the code, it has given me a refresher on
what I wrote!</p>

<p>Today wasn&rsquo;t as productive as I had planned, but I got some good stuff
done.</p>

<p>4:30am meeting with Boysen, and should have a landing page for The
Men&rsquo;s Work soon.</p>

<p>8:00am IL lesson in which we talked about Tsukiji and 2020 Olympics
<a href="https://the-japan-news.com/news/article/0004879769">https://the-japan-news.com/news/article/0004879769</a></p>

<p>came home to work on MT3, but ended up just sleeping</p>

<p>7:00pm Tokyo Men&rsquo;s Circle <a href="https://tokyo.mypowercircle.org/">https://tokyo.mypowercircle.org/</a></p>

<p>8:06pm someone killed themselves in Seijogakuenmae (a station along my
train line)</p>

<p>9:30pm though trains were slow, got to ride from Yoyogi Uehara with
Lin.  In Yoyogi-Koen, we waited until the next train arrived,
terminated, and had everyone come over to our train so we could go to
Yoyogi Uehara.</p>

<p>11:30pm wrote this entry after arriving home and taking a shower.</p>

<p>I had to tweak the file path for the database file from</p>

<pre><code>classes/database/class.database.php

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>classes/Database/Database.php
</code></pre>

<p>And add <code>namespace Database</code> to it, but now it is loaded via the
autoloader script above in alllll the places it is needed.  Overall, I
removed 75 lines of <code>require_once('class.database.php')</code></p>

<p>Exciting MKP Tokyo news!</p>

<p>I sent this to my online Integration Group.</p>

<pre><code>I just got confirmation: I will be co-facilitating a 3-week online
MKP introduction called The Men's Work https://mkpusa.org/themenswork/
with Paul Newell, who is currently co-facilitating it in the US.

On Fridays, 7pm - 8:30pm (Japan time), November 3rd, 10th, and
17th, we will do this online training for men in Tokyo.

Once we run this 3 week series of meetings a couple of times, I
will create a new men's circle in Gotanda (Tokyo) on Fridays for
men who are interested.  Once those Gotanda men have sat in circle
for a few months, I will do a Mission Statement workshop with
them.

Once we have two circles humming along, I plan to invite an MKP
man from overseas to Japan to teach facilitation skills to men who
are interested.  My want is to get more and more circles started
in Japan so we can create a groundswell movement to have enough
energy to do NWTAs here in Japan.

<p>I found a solution to all my work woes.</p>

<pre><code>I just had an interesting thought about my computer job, which I
brought up in the meeting on Monday.  My website client is AB.

It is likely that I can find a company that can do the work I am
doing for less money, but it's not possible to secretly act as a
middle man and keep the money due to how payments are done now.

The value for me overall is to reduce the load of this job, which
taxes me physically and emotionally.

Value for AB is to have a real company (Engine Yard) doing the
tedious work I've been doing, and therefore if I die, AB isn't
fucked by losing all their server/website knowledge.

I'll have to do some research, but I can probably still do the fun
part of the job and leave the annoying part to Engine Yard.
</code></pre>

<p>Yay! Why didn&rsquo;t I think of this before?  I heard of them ages ago at
an iOS meeting.  If they can handle the server stuff, that would make
my life sooo much easier.</p>

<p>So I looked up their website
<a href="https://www.engineyard.com/">https://www.engineyard.com/</a></p>

<p><a href="//b.robnugen.com/journal/2018/2018_oct_05_engine_yard_does_ruby.png"><img src="//b.robnugen.com/journal/2018/thumbs/2018_oct_05_engine_yard_does_ruby.png" alt="2018 oct 05 engine yard does ruby" /></a></p>

<p>Ruby????</p>

<p>Aw man!</p>

<p>I need someone to deal with PHP!</p>

<p>A couple days later, I found that someone is me.</p>

<p>I found
<a href="https://leanpub.com/mlaphp">Modernizing Legacy Applications in PHP</a>
shows how to go from spaghetti to modern framework <em>including unit tests</em>,
without any downtime.</p>

<p>My code is <em>not</em> as bad as the code in the examples, which includes
MySQL and HTML and CSS in the same file, but I definitely suffer from
lack of tests, so rely on crossing my fingers and praying each time I
deploy.</p>

<hr />

<p>While writing this entry, I found I can wrap my app in Ruby Hooks to
deploy it

<p>I will clean up the code first, then see what&rsquo;s up with outsourcing
the server side.</p>

<p>BH set up a Slack space for MKP Japan where we can discuss creating
the organization and setting up some trainings.</p>

<p>I got a multi-month fix done for AB; now users can use the same filter
on their custom list page as they can on the main list.  I don&rsquo;t
recall why it was set up this weird way before, but it is better now.
Oh, and they now have a recycle bin function on the custom list page
so it is easier to hide and restore things from their list.  (It used
to take 3 clicks to hide an item (and they could not be restored) but
now it takes 1 click to hide an item, 1 click to reveal hidden items,
and 1 click to restore each hidden item)</p>

<p>And I glued a single stick in place for Marble Track 3.  It is the
first stick that will be used as a support for the Outer Spiral.</p>

<p>(written 14:06 Thursday 20 September 2018 JST)</p>

<p>Wednesdays are usually long for me.  Wake up at 5am (after getting
home no earlier than 10:30pm after men&rsquo;s group, but Tuesday night I
went to The Pink Cow (great to see Traci after I have been away so
long!) for an event for hemp oil that Rohini invited me to attend.</p>

<p>Anyway, got home Tuesday night at like 1:15am to find Lin sleeping on
the couch and then showered so had 3.5 hours to sleep before woke up
at 5am Wednesday, left at 5:45 am with happy tummy full of banana
smoothie Lin made.</p>

<p>Slept for an hour on the train from Noborito to Kawasaki (the train
starts in Noborito and chills there for 30 minutes before departure
(which allows a five minute window to get a seat) so I get a seat and
sleep or work on something for that hour).</p>

<p>We have been playing the camping game in my first lesson at Solid
Square.  &ldquo;I am going camping, and I will bring _____&rdquo; and other people
try to figure out what they can bring.</p>

<p>I started with an easy one, anything that starts with the letter C.
Then anything that was red.  Then Ai-chan did one of anything that can
be purchased.  Yesterday Yohei did one that was tricky for me: any
customer their company had worked for.  He started with Haneda
Airport.   Now it&rsquo;s on me again, and for fun, I started with Haneda
Airport.</p>

<p>Here is the list, as far as I can remember:</p>

<ul>
<li>Haneda Airport</li>
<li>Los Angeles International Airport</li>
<li>Mt Fuji</li>
<li>Kawasaki Station</li>
<li>(forgot)</li>
<li>Milano Airport</li>
<li>Noborito Station</li>
<li>(forgot)</li>
<li>(forgot)</li>
<li>Ranking Queen</li>
<li>(forgot)</li>
<li>(forgot)</li>
<li>Ueno Park</li>
<li>(forgot)</li>
<li>(forgot)</li>
<li>Texas</li>
<li>Shinjuku Gyoen</li>
<li>Zebra</li>
<li>Satoshi</li>
<li>Rob</li>
<li>My cat</li>
</ul>

<p>We ended there, and I hope they solve it during the week or at least
during the next lesson.  I refused to give the answer, though I did
give some hints by &ldquo;changing my mind&rdquo; about what things could be
brought.</p>

<p>After that lesson I worked in Excelsior on something&hellip; maybe on
Japanese for Marble Track 3 website.</p>

<p>I bought chocolate for the staff at SCC for my next lesson.  After the
lesson, we had a Sweets Party during which we mixed up all the
chocolates and tried to guess which flavors would be which before
biting into them.</p>

<p>Then headed to JB School for 5 lessons in 5.5 hours.  Kids lessons
<!-- (with Ryunoske, Itsuki, Taiga, Toshiro, Kanta, and Suzu)--> were pretty
fine cause we can move around a lot.  Then super sleepy in the 3rd
lesson <!-- (with Shige) --> so ate some more candy during the 4th lesson
<!-- (with Hide and Shoichi)--> and was genkier during last lesson<!-- (with
Kyoko, Kaori, and Misato) -->.</p>

<p>Walked back to Kawasaki station <!-- with Chihomi --> and then Lin
picked me up at our station.  So so thankful for her support!</p>
