<p><p>I&rsquo;ve essentially started over my generic survey
project.  My goal this time is to make it <em>so</em> generic
that we can just drop information into about 20
variables and a few datasets and <em>bang</em>.  New
survey.</p>

<p><p>So far I&rsquo;ve gotten the first page <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of the way
finished.  Great job, Rob!</p>

<p><p>Tonight hopefully Wende and I are going to watch a
movie.  We might also see <em>Chicken Run</em>
tomorrow morning!  Yay!</p>

<p><p>Yesterday at work seemed strange because literally I didn&rsquo;t have a
project that needed attention.  Two projects are on hold as we wait
for further information from our clients.  Yay!</p>

<p><p>So I began working on some generic macro type things that will
hopefully allow us to code more efficiently on future projects.  Since
I&rsquo;m beginning to get a better grasp on SAS and how it can be used (and
how we use it at work), this is pretty much the first time I&rsquo;ve been
able to do this.</p>

<p><p>(nerd-babble:) SAS has no object oriented features, but I&rsquo;m
basically writing generic functions that do some of the basic things
we do on each web-based survey.  We can call these functions directly
(with or without parameters), or set up a function for the particular
project that calls the function, sending the parameters we usually
would need for this project.  At each function call in the program
code, any or all the parameters may have new values given, effectively
changing what the function prints.</p>

<p><p>If I remember my OOP stuff, this is a version of Inheritence, but
it&rsquo;s all done at run time instead of compile time.</p>

<p><p>(end nerd-babble:) Oh!!  Kevin loved his plate!  He thanked me
several distinct times for it.  Karla got him a Big Mouth Billy Bass
(sings &ldquo;Take me to the river&rdquo; and &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Worry, Be Happy&rdquo;) that is
apparently hilarious after one has had very little sleep, or a couple
of alcoholic beverages.  I can see that it <em>would</em> be funny, but right
now it just seems kinda silly.</p>

<p><p>Work &ldquo;today&rdquo; was unique in that I actually caught up with all the
projects.  By this I mean that there was no more SAS programming to be
done until we hear more from our clients.  Wow!</p>

<p><p>I transcribed some 1991 journal entries, recognizing that I&rsquo;m more
inspired to do so now that Molly has offered to help.  :-)</p>

<p><p>Tomorrow at work we will celebrate Kevin&rsquo;s birthday!!  I&rsquo;m greatly
excited to give him his new plate.  He loves baseball, and is a Red
Sox fan.  It has an image of the Boston Red Sox logo on the front, but
instead of &ldquo;BOSTON RED SOX&rdquo; it says &ldquo;ALL MY RED SOX&rdquo; (since he (and
Karla and Drew and Kasi and Erika) all enjoy watching All My Children
during lunch each day)</p>

<p><p>So I&rsquo;m working now on a project I&rsquo;ll call the DTRU Project (If I refer to the KTRU Project, it&rsquo;s probably a type-o).  DTRU Project is a subset of the Big Monster Project that I had been working on for months.</p>

<p><p>I have been commenting out huge sections of code that I think we will eventually need as the DTRU project experiences Feature Creep, but for now, it does not need.</p>

<p><p>Just a moment ago I tested some code, and even after all the commenting and changing and removing, including changing data set structures, <em>bing</em>, it worked.</p>

<p><p>I was literally surprised, &ldquo;oh my god!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I had expected not to be this far along for another hour or so.  I think that&rsquo;s worth a good unicycle break.</p>

<p class=date>6:31pm CDT Tuesday 9 May 2000</p></p>

<p><p>A couple of interesting things at work today:</p>

<p><ol> <p><li>With some help from Kevin, I rewrote a screen on our big
project.  This screen is called rateWho; it displays a list of names
for whom an individual may provide feedback. Originally, I designed
the screen so that if a person had missed the time-frame to rate
someone, that someone&rsquo;s name would not show up.  As written, the
screen checked a field in a dataset to see if it was too late to
provide feedback.</p>

<p><p>The new improved design requires that all names be displayed.  The
&ldquo;too late&rdquo; names are written in a different list that says something
like, &ldquo;Too late, sucker,&rdquo; or something to that effect.</p>

<p><p>Kevin wrote a phat SQL query (I&rsquo;ve messed with SQL before, but
don&rsquo;t totally remember it now) that pulled in 3 different data sets
and created one table with all the information I needed to output the
appropriate lists.  I finished it at 6pm and zipped home.</p>

<p><p><li>We are moving.  Work, I mean.</p>

<p><p>The landlords have increased our rent by 60%, but have not
increased the quality of the building worth a dooky, so we are outta
there!  Timeframe is like 60 to 90 days.  It&rsquo;s pretty exciting, and
I&rsquo;m thankful that I basically know enough about the network that I can
transfer it as it exists to the new location.  It&rsquo;ll mean hooking up a
new DSL circuit at our new place; I will call our ISP soonly on that.</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;re moving just 2 city blocks away, which is not too far, but
significant for me: it&rsquo;s on the other side of the freeway, and 2 city
blocks further away from our new house.  I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll survive.  Maybe I&rsquo;ll get a bike soon and bike those extra two blocks.</p>

<p class=date>11:33pm CDT Tuesday 9 May 2000</p></p>

<p>Ack.  I just got a call from Kevin.  He booted our webserver
tonight and it's not coming back up.  After it checks the memory,
finds the disks, gets past the "press spacebar to use last known good
configuration", it flashes error codes and restarts.

<p>I'm going in to work now.

<p class=date>3:45am CDT Wednesday 10 May 2000</p>

<p><p>Sure enough, when I arrive the server was still rebooting itself as
described above.  I didn&rsquo;t know what to try, except maybe reinstalling
Win NT on the machine&hellip; maybe it would allow us to refresh the system
files instead of overwriting everything.  We really didn&rsquo;t want to
lose any data.</p>

<p><p>I asked Kevin if it was more important to save the data or just
blast through and reinstall, which would (probably) be faster.  He
said saving the data is more important.</p>

<p><p>Called Microsoft support, paid $245, and the short version of the
story is that all data was safe.</p>

<p><p>Mostly just in talking to the tech guy (Derek (sp)), I worked
myself through my own solution.</p>

<p><p>First brainstorm: we have two drives in the machine, and they are
mirrored.  So presumably, we can take one drive out, have the copy of
the data there, fix the other drive, restore the data.</p>

<p><p>Took one drive out, and magically, the other drive booted no
problem.  And all the data was there..  Except it was all one week
old.</p>

<p><p>Swapped the drives, and magically, the other other drive booted no
problem.  And all the data was there.  And it was up to date.</p>

<p><p>The theory is that when we had a power outage last week, one drive
was corrupted, and hadn&rsquo;t been written to since.  When we tried to
boot with both drives, the OS said, &ldquo;hey these drives aren&rsquo;t
mirrored!&rdquo; and wouldn&rsquo;t boot.</p>

<p><p>Low level formatted the week-old-data drive, recreated the mirror,
everything is happy.</p>

<p><p>During the low level format, I got to talk to Hillary on AOL IM.
That was great fun!  Now I&rsquo;m going to bed.</p>

<p><p>Wende is at work all day today (9am to 7pm) and I intend to do a lot around the house.  I&rsquo;ve sent out The Feel Good Net, and wrote a letter to Karen.</p>

<p><p>Now for the house, I&rsquo;m going to Home Depot to purchase some motor
&ldquo;dimmer&rdquo; switches for our ceiling fans so we can control their speed
from the wall outlet!</p>

<p><p>I also plan to flea-spray my old bed (which has been quarantined in
the garage since I moved my junque two weeks ago) and move it to the
guest bedroom.</p>

<p><p>Then maybe some more snail mail and who knows what else!</p>

<p><p>Both of my bosses are pausing for lunch today, which means the work load
is manageable, and therefore I will likely get to meet with them about full
timeliness and maybe DSL at me and Wen&rsquo;s new house!</p>

<p><p>Honestly, I think the prospect of them paying for DSL is pretty good;
it&rsquo;s relatively inexpensive and will allow me to work from home on projects
and problems.  With the amount of coding I&rsquo;ve done with this (my first) SAS
project, there will apparently be lots more coding to come.  Plus I know of
some big big long drawn out projects coming soon..</p>

<p><p>Probably the coolest most imminent unknown in my life is around work:  I&rsquo;m going to be meeting with my bosses tomorrow to discuss me shifting to a full time position, with paid medical benefits!  The unknown part is my salary.  How much do I want?  How much do I think I&rsquo;m worth?</p>

<p><p>I can start by calculating my hourly wage out to 40 hours per week.  I&rsquo;m not in the mood right now to put all the numbers on my site (I&rsquo;ve done it before), but I am happy with the resulting number, and it will allow me to pay me and Wen&rsquo;s house payment!</p>

<p><p>But then&hellip; there&rsquo;s one more thing.. Work might pay for DSL to my house!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   So awesome!!!!!!  And I&rsquo;m not talking wussy ADSL, but low to moderate SDSL with a netopia router that can put me on VPN (Virtual Private Network) with our work network!</p>

<p><p>The best part about DSL is that it&rsquo;ll save me and Wen big dollars on 2 phone lines for modem, or on DSL, and we can put both computers on the network.  Awww yeah.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ll call it lovely synchronicity, and not manic work work work to
make money for the new house.  Yesterday I worked 14.5 hours to
complete my portion of the SAS project, then handed it over at 9pm to
my boss to do the rest.  This version of the project goes into
production today as a pilot for a small group of people before we set
the masses of users loose on it.</p>

<p><p>Today is KTRU day!! I&rsquo;ll let you know how it goes.</p>

<p><p>Oh, speaking of KTRU, and I don&rsquo;t know if I mentioned this
previously, I got a parking ticket from the Rice University
Police.. for being a &ldquo;frequent visitor&rdquo; in the visitor parking lot.</p>

<p><p>I appealed the ticket the day after I got it, but haven&rsquo;t heard
back from them yet.  So today I&rsquo;ll park in the damn stadium parking
lot, which is fully 20 times further away than my lovely visitor lot
next to the Student Center where the station is located.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ll ask at the DJ meeting today if KTRU can support me in any way on this.</p>

<p><p>I think I may slide into the station a bit early so I can review CDs!</p>
