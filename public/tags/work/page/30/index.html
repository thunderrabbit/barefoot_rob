<p>AB DB primarily consists of two big tables.  Table U has 77k records,
and 160 columns.  Table B has maybe 40k records and maybe 70 columns.
There&rsquo;s a 1-to-many relationship from B to U.  Doing joins on them
takes about 3 or 4 seconds.</p>

<p>That ain&rsquo;t good, considering the joins are done all the frickin time.</p>

<p>I guess that&rsquo;s why when I got the original data, a lot of what&rsquo;s now
in the B table was in the U table.  I was like, &ldquo;normalization to the
rescue!&rdquo; but now it&rsquo;s sloooowwwww.</p>

<p>About 20 columns in table U are varchar 200, so that&rsquo;s 2k UTF-8
characters, so 4k bytes per record (if they&rsquo;re all filled, which
they&rsquo;re not, but it&rsquo;s still overhead that I wonder if I can split into
other tables).</p>

there anymore, but they were like, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll contact you.&rdquo;  I shan&rsquo;t hold

<p>I spoke with Nate and Alfonzo yesterday about work stuff; Alfonzo has
been too busy to do it so I may get a chance to make a few extra
dollars.  The contract may be terminated though, not sure yet.  This
is for the CB project we started six years ago.  They&rsquo;ve been on a
&ldquo;maintenance&rdquo; contract but asking for lots of changes.</p>

<p>Just finished meeting with Tomomi and Sho about phase three of their
website.  I&rsquo;m thankful that Tomomi took into consideration the
existing technologies we&rsquo;ve used on the site when planning how to do
the next steps.  My next steps are to create some rough mockups and
estimate time required to make the changes.</p>

<p><strong>7:10pm Wednesday 8 May 2013</strong></p>

<p>I was thinking recently how I didn&rsquo;t use <a href="https://brian.io/lawnchair/">lawnchair</a> to keep track of which items were on a page when coming back to it.</p>

<p>But today I did use lawnchair for a different thing, mostly because I was already using lawnchair for a similar issue.  There&rsquo;s a page which uses <a href="https://datatables.net/">Datatables</a> to display lists of units in the system.  When clicking to view a particular unit, there are previous and next buttons on the page.  Lawnchair keeps a big-ass list of all the unit ids so it knows which is the previous and which is the next.  I know there&rsquo;s some <del>optimation</del> optimization to be done here, but haven&rsquo;t figured out how yet.</p>

<p>A long time ago, a request was made by the client to select all the records in the list.  This needed to be backed by the database (<code>users_2_selections</code>) and I couldn&rsquo;t figure a good way to &ldquo;re-search&rdquo; the units according to what search parameters were just done.  I told them &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a really hard problem&rdquo; and put it off for months.</p>

<p>THEN, today, when looking at a different request, I realized that selecting all the records in the list could solve it (more easily than another way to solve it).  So I re-visited this problem and realized &ldquo;derp! I have all the unit ids in Lawnchair!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When they click on the thing (what&rsquo;s the word for a span that&rsquo;s not a link and not a button but responds to a click event?), it says &ldquo;hey lawnchair, give me that list of ids!&rdquo; and then ajaxes  &ldquo;hey server, they wanna select all these ids!&rdquo; and the server is like &ldquo;cool&rdquo; and slaps them into the users_2_selections table and all is good.</p>

<p>EXCEPT for one detail: it seems that if there&rsquo;s more than 1000 unit ids, the server doesn&rsquo;t get them all.  I&rsquo;ll have to look at that one later, possibly tomorrow.</p>

<p>dinner time now!</p>

<p>Yesterday at work I got the pagination to be ajax driven if javascript is enabled and GET driven if javascript is not enabled.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve started to cut a couple corners as the project is a bit overdue.  For example, instead of figure out how to redisplay the same units when clicking back to the map page (I&rsquo;d probably use Lawnchair), I just open units in a new tab.</p>

<p><strong>7:04am Friday 26 April 2013</strong></p>

<p>I found some code online in Perl that showed an awesome fast way to do clustering of pins on a map.  I&rsquo;ll probably post the code on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">SO</a> where many people have been asking how to do it.   That might make up for the points I lost yesterday by asking a question.</p>

<p>When a map marker is clicked, I load the units associated with it via ajax.  To display the units, I was using underscorejs and a crappy little template, but then I realized I should use the same template as is used on the front page.</p>

<p>But on the front page, I load the list of units with a full page refresh.   So I had to tweak the template to use javascript and then realized I should make the front page do the same.  So today I plan to make the front page units also load via ajax, which will make the site more responsive and consolidate a bit of code!</p>
