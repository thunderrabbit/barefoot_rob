<p>Just finished eating sakura ice cream with Scean, Kasagawa, and
another guy whose name I didn&rsquo;t get.  We talked a lot (though I didn&rsquo;t
ask for permission to transcribe his interesting stories)!</p>

<p>This was all after about 6 hours of group lessons, all coordinated
from the front of the room; basically the lesson content wasn&rsquo;t
difficult but all the coordination took a bit of focus.  I didn&rsquo;t
think to bring water, so by the end I was a little parched and had a
bit of a headache, but bare feet in the rain took care of that quite
quickly!</p>

<p>We all chowed at a restaurant, and it was a quite nice experience
overall.  I kinda wanted to stay, but I really want to improve my
Japanese so I&rsquo;m going to class now.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve essentially finished a maze today for a person on Fiverr.</p>

<h2 id="12-20">12:20</h2>

<p>Finished changes to the bodyandsoul dev site.</p>

<h2 id="14-50">14:50</h2>

<p>I made some changes to the AB website which only I can see.  They
asked me to estimate how long it would take and I ended up just doing
it to confirm my time estimate was accurate.  I added code like, &ldquo;if
userID == 1&rdquo; to block the execution unless I&rsquo;m the one logged in.</p>

<h2 id="15-31">15:31</h2>

<p>Hmmm interesting!  I&rsquo;m listening to
<a href="https://serialpodcast.org/">Serial</a> so now I want to record every
minute of my days!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m here at sbstrm office; my shoes are off and I&rsquo;m working on
updating the Japanese apps.</p>

<h2 id="15-51">15:51</h2>

<p>Amazing.  itunes.apple.com doesn&rsquo;t work in Safari on iOS simulator.
Why would that be?</p>

<h2 id="16-02">16:02</h2>

<p>I just did 30 pushups in one .. &ldquo;sprint&rdquo;?  What does one call a series
of pushups?  I&rsquo;m up to 753 for the month, so I&rsquo;m 53 ahead of schedule
of 100 pushups per day in April.  That&rsquo;s great because I was 200
behind schedule as of the morning of April 3rd.</p>

<h2 id="17-17">17:17</h2>

<p>Aha!  I got a message from Y last week saying she couldn&rsquo;t take her
lesson at 7pm.  That matched the info from M, so I was like, &ldquo;no
worries!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I got to my 5pm lesson location to meet K and she wasn&rsquo;t there&hellip;.
OOOhhhh the message from Y was actually from K who must have meant
5pm, not 7pm.  I guess!!</p>

<p>So I went up to a super-non-smoking coffee shop to work on latest
Unity project with no tutorial training wheels!  So far I&rsquo;ve got the
world&rsquo;s one and only git commit
6e1d44ad623c6c2b31c8d04487b60893f94be2a9 with
<a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/unity3d-starter"><code>README.md</code> and <code>.gitignore</code> for Unity</a>
fully set up!!</p>

<p>The project was originally described as &ldquo;keep the same structure and just change
all the text.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cool sounds good, and it paid relatively well.</p>

<p>Once I accepted, it was, &ldquo;oh and put up a full page banner with four
clickable images below it while we change all the text and change all
the images&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fine fuckit so I put the banner up and I changed all the images; it
was still fair pay for the total amount of work.</p>

<p>Okay, so we changed all the text (and some CSS), and all the images,
some of which were in jpg while the site requested png, and alll of
which were misnamed, but fine it&rsquo;s done. Gimme my money.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, sorry. The boss doesn&rsquo;t like the colors; need to replace all the
images <em>again</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Okay, now it&rsquo;s no longer funny.  I haven&rsquo;t gotten paid the first
amount yet and now it&rsquo;s near double work, and work that could have
been avoided, imho.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh and change some of the text again, and can check why the email
isn&rsquo;t working?&rdquo;  So even my project manager doesn&rsquo;t know anything
about web.  The link was &lt;a href=&ldquo;address@domain.com&rdquo;&gt;email
us!&lt;/a&gt; which is obviously not going to work!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh and though I didn&rsquo;t mention it before, can you make all the
outgoing links open in a new tab?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;oh and add some text to each of these h4s but make them smaller so
the text doesn&rsquo;t go past two lines, and add a new paragraph here and
two new paragraphs there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>bah.</p>

<p>Headed in to sbstrm now to replace some images on the new Body and
Soul website.  Sho said there were more than he expected, but I expect
I can finish them all in 4 hours before I have to leave for Mutsumi&rsquo;s
lesson.</p>

<p>##6pm</p>

<p>5:55 pm suddenly arrived and I was like oh fuck and ran out the door
to go to the toy store on the way to Muchan&rsquo;s lesson.  It&rsquo;s Shibata&rsquo;s
last Tuesday there, so I definitely wanted to say bye and thanks to
her.</p>

<p>##23:40</p>

<p>They taunted me with a puzzle called Quatro Formagio (with the &ldquo;form&rdquo;
because the goal is to form a square pattern with wedge shapped
pieces).. I wasn&rsquo;t able to solve it in the time I had available.
Boooo.</p>

<p>Shibata emailed me tonight and was like, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s do language exchange
via email&rdquo; and &ldquo;I can tell you the answer to the puzzle&rdquo; hahahahah.
Definitely no to the puzzle hint; not sure about language exchange.</p>

<p>Workin&rsquo; late with Sho on a new site for Body and Soul; they put on an
event each year in May so we&rsquo;re prepping for the announcement.</p>

<p>I put their original site in a git repo and have their banner page on
the master branch, but edits to the new site were started from a few
commits back.  Blarg.  I agree with my decisison to start edits from a
few commits back, but maybe I should have two &ldquo;master&rdquo; branches: one
master-banner and one master-site, or something.  Then each master
would have far fewer changes and no weird merges required.</p>

<p>I might abandon the existing master branch and just pretend it&rsquo;s not
there and move forward with two master-_____ branches plan.</p>

<p>Tonight I set up a repo for a site I&rsquo;m supposed to temporarily replace
with a full page banner ad on Monday.  I think I&rsquo;ll call the site BS
or maybe BSJ.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s running in csh not bash, so my preferred git log replacement
looks like ass.</p>

Alfonzo will be moving to a new department soon so I won&rsquo;t be able to
bug him as much with questions.</p>

<p>##18:05 Friday 20 February 2015 JST##</p>

<p>Recently I have been posting &ldquo;Daily meditation threads&rdquo; on
/r/bitTippers, encouraging myself and others to take some time to sit
quietly each day.</p>

<p>The posts get about an 80% approval rate, with some people saying &ldquo;wow
thank you!&rdquo; and some saying variants of &ldquo;no way jose&rdquo;. Fun stuff!</p>

<p>Today was the fourth such thread, I think.</p>

<hr />

<p>I worked on a maze for a guy on Fiverr.  It should be pretty neat when
it&rsquo;s done.  Well, the project over all should be neat.  It consists of
9 postcards with a maze drawn across all of them.</p>

<p>His preferred recipient will get just the center card, with maze paths
flowing off the edges of the cards on all sides.</p>

<hr />

<p>Was about to work on AB when I remembered I said I would finish
something for CB today.  I checked the ticket in Redmine and found a
new ticket with priority &ldquo;Immediate&rdquo;, so I did that one first.  It was
my original mistake (ahem) so yeah.</p>

<p>Started working on the ticket I said I&rsquo;d do.  It required some image
duplication (basically extend a ~1500 x 15px png to be ~1750 x 15px and
add some sections to it) which will be visible through CSS.</p>

<p>I finished adding three sections to it and then logged the time in
Redmine.</p>

<p>Hmm; it seems someone already updated the image!  D&rsquo;oh!</p>

<p>I downloaded their zip file (weird for a single image), annnnddd</p>

<p>ohhh I see why it&rsquo;s a zip file.  30 separate images, in jpg format,
with a crappy font, <em>and</em> inconsistent spacing of the text on the
images.  Oh, and a misspelling, AND missing one of the images from the
original png.</p>

<p>Getting feedback from this client is close to impossible, so I just
buckled down and placed the 30 shoddy .jpg images on top of the .png</p>

<p>I actually was <em>not</em> able to get it pushed online, but I uploaded the
.png and my .xcf (Gimp) file up to Redmine.</p>

<p>Right <em>now</em> I&rsquo;m on 東横線 headed to 中目黒 for a Japanese meetup.  I
guess I should switch my head to 日本語モード、だね。</p>

<p>Spent 6 hours working on AB site, planning for how to migrate them to
their new server(s) (web + DB).  That was while emailing S about some
problem with server running out of memory.  That ain&rsquo;t good.  I
boosted the allowed memory in config file, but would love to figure
out what the actual problem is (more precisely than there&rsquo;s a lotta
records!)</p>

<p>Sweet as.  I came to Wired Cafe in Atre and asked if they have an
electrical outlet.  Not only do they, but to use it I get to sit in a
glass-wall corner overlooking Azalea and the front of Kawasaki
station.</p>
