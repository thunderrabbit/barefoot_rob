                        <p>Hide and Akiko from 7pm class each needed to make up some lessons, so
stayed for the 8pm class featuring Misato and Tatsuya.</p>

<p>I think it worked pretty well; they had not met each other, and they
are all pretty much similar personalities so I figured they would get
along fine.</p>

<p>After self intros, most of the time they talked about Akiko&rsquo;s challenging business trip
to Hydrabad, India.  Most of the rest of the time we talked about Hide&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p>Headed toward home on Nambu Line now after waking up at 4:30 (after
one sleep cycle) and doing my morning routine (write dreams, write
gratitude, meditate, brush teeth, etc) then headed to work in Kawasaki
for JB in Solid Square.  Sayuri came about 15 minutes late and was the
only student in attendance.</p>

<p>Headed to JR Kawasaki afterward to meet やなさん but he ended up
having to cancel for some reason.  I was a bit grouchy like why
couldn&rsquo;t he tell me ahead of time, but bah.</p>

<p>Got some food at a bakery and then headed to DiCE internet cafe and
slept for a couple of hours then ended up browsing Instagram and
clicking the little hearts because I heard that&rsquo;s what we gotta do
these days to make connections online.</p>

<p>After seeing Menya&rsquo;s post about too many calories, I was inspired to
have only one (1) cup of soft serve ice cream at the cafe (normally I
eat 3 or 4, easily).</p>

<p>Headed to JB school for kid lessons then adult lessons and wondered
about my place in my universe.  All the while, my blog entry is
brewing in my head.  I choose what I do (and no one else really
cares).  But I haven&rsquo;t really started the entry because of the message
in its title.</p>

<p>And also because my site is effed up now and I need to fix my theme to
work with latest version of Hugo (or something).</p>

<p>It looks like I am going to have to spend a day tracking down how to
make my site work again; I wrote to the main creator of Hugo, but no
reply.  When I posted on the forums last time, I ended up paying too
much for shoddy work that crept up in price.</p>

<p>No students in my 6pm class here.  And my most-common student in next
lesson has called in that he will not attend.  I&rsquo;m gonna use this time
to write a bit.</p>

<p>I had been planning to talk to them about
<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=wtc+7">WTC 7</a> and stuff on the anniversary
of Airplane Day.</p>

<h5 id="19-39">19:39</h5>

<p>No students in my 7pm class&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="20-00">20:00</h5>

<p>One student in 8pm class.</p>

<p>We started the lesson talking about the typhoon and her plans to
practice piano next Sunday for a rehearsal on September 22nd.</p>

<p>Ended up talking about my websites, and I realize why I am so
distracted!</p>

<p>On Monday I got email working with AWS SES.  It was pretty much
plug-n-play level of easy since I already had a site set up that had
been using <a href="https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer">PHPMailer</a>.</p>

<p>But eff me I could not figure out what was different from the setup on
our old server which was sending emails from itself using Exim no
problem.</p>

<p>I slept on 南武 line from 登戸 to 川崎 station today.  Nice to get a
57 minute sleep on a 30 minute trip.  (The train sits in Noborito for
27 minutes before departing.)</p>

<p>Early morning lessons on Wednesday are back after the summer break.
I&rsquo;ve been teaching here for some years, &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t mind&rdquo; if the lessons
were taken over by someone else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t mind&rdquo; in quotes because that was the phrase Eriko
doublechecked with me to be true regarding the lesson.</p>

<h5 id="09-46">09:46</h5>

<p>The lesson was fine today, and I wouldn&rsquo;t mind coming back next week
(probably).  Ayano, Satoshi, Ai, and I talked about summer vacation
for a minute and then dove back into the book.  To help them be
involved in their own learning, I have taken to having them be
&ldquo;manager&rdquo; for various exercises in the text.  This helps me because I
might otherwise skip or dwell on something too difficult or easy for
them.</p>

<p>Several different things on my day off today.  Mostly related to work,
where I realized the value of having a staging server with non-live
data.  &ldquo;Ohhh that is right; I tested saving data as well..&rdquo; when AB
was like, &ldquo;Um, where is the Azabujuban record?&rdquo; which had been renamed
to &ldquo;Doraemon 5e5433a38e2b035689a75c9ed11ffb0e&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once I fixed all of those (about 8 different records) based on the old
live DB which is still available at cli with <code>mysql</code> as root, I
watched episode 3 of The Naked Director.</p>

<p>This show is somewhat a comedy, but fills in my imagination of the
heady days before the bubble burst here in Japan.  I sometimes wonder
what it could have been like then, and this gives me a sense that I
would not have necessarily been better off for being here then.
Interesting to watch, though, and practice listening to Japanese.</p>

<p>I tried to do some more work, but was leaning toward porn after having
watched a shows which leans toward porn, so I took a nap.</p>

<p>Woke up and wrote down <a href="/journal/2019/08/30/dream-unstoppable-trains/">a dream about unstoppable trains</a>.</p>

<p><a href="//b.robnugen.com/journal/2019/dreams/20190830_165150_Dream_0000000249.jpg"><img src="//b.robnugen.com/journal/2019/dreams/thumbs/20190830_165150_Dream_0000000249.jpg" alt="20190830 165150 Dream 0000000249" /></a></p>

<p>And as I write this, I see the messy image and realize if I ever clean
up those images, I hope I either create redirects or think to fix the
links here.</p>

<p>Mohamed asked the URL for my journal, which is nice timing because
today is the first day for me to use ROBOT pages from August 29th,
which include writing a journal entry by default.  Again, this
directory and file structure leaves a lot to be
desired. <a href="https://b.robnugen.com/robot/2019/">https://b.robnugen.com/robot/2019/</a></p>

<p>I want to have OCR determine the dates of the pages and rename the
files based on those dates.  I have considered posting each page in
this journal stream, but I think it would be better to make an RSS
feed of them (but it would not get updated with each scan (if it was
tied only into this repo of entries)).  It should be a different RSS
feed, built just for b.robnugen.com</p>

<p>I got AB&rsquo;s DB on RDS, but had it in a different AZ than the server
(oops) which caused some slowness that AB noticed.  I turned on
Multi-AZ and rebooted the RDS instance with &ldquo;failover&rdquo; selected and
now AB&rsquo;s RDS in AB&rsquo;s EC2&rsquo;s AZ makes it noticably faster.  Yay!</p>

<p>Today Naoko worked on introducing the history zone, including teacup
carrying dolls, perpetual clock, and the early days of electricity in
Japan.</p>

<p>What was it like back in the day when a simple thing like a few candle
power light bulb could be so impressive?</p>

<p>Yasu talked about the Meissner effect and flux pinning.  I would like
to do an experiment..  will the Meissner effect keep a thing suspended
above the magnetic table or is that only do to flux pinning?</p>

<p>Liliko confirmed some changes to some quiz questions for a new exhibit
that will be an audio recognition quiz.</p>

<p>Today there were only 1.5 students in my Akihabara class.  This number
is down from our high of like 8 last year when I had to stop checking
homework during the lesson because there ended up being no time for
class.  I guess there would be time with just 2 students&rsquo; worth of
homework.</p>

<p>Anyway, the lesson kinda devolved into a China vs Japan debate.  I
should have nipped it, but I was too tired and I kinda thought the
students would sort it out.</p>
