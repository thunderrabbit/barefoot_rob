      <description>16:51 Saturday 19 August 2017 JST We are on the way home now after having gone to a wasabi restaurant and museum next to a wasabi farm and a river of clear water. Actually two adjacent rivers, one of which seemed to be slightly higher than the other.</description>

Today started last night for me. Manda came over and we talked and chilled and she had brought some Japanese crab burritos or something like that: Crab, celery, rice, all rolled into a burrito shape with seaweed as the wrapper. Good stuff. She ate them mostly with soy sauce, I ate them mostly plain. Then she showed me the green stuff that came with the meal.</description>
