      <description>08:39 Tuesday 16 January 2018 JST I worked for four companies yesterday. First was my lesson in Akabanebashi for Tariq. Then walked to Nishi Azabu for MR Laboratories client (company DNE yet). Then walked across the Nishi Azabu intersection to a lesson for TESS. Then bus and train to Kawasaki for 2 hours of lessons at my favorite, SCC. Came home and had one more lesson for MR Laboratories.</description>
