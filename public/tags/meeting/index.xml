      <description>22:03 Wednesday 27 February 2019 JST Today was the 3-weeks-out meeting for we staff of the New Warrior Training Adventure (NWTA) in British Columbia, Canada. It was a good meeting; we each have a buddy and each man on the call checked in for his buddy, with the presumption that the buddies have been in touch with each other.
I was inspired after the call and reached out to my two teams via email.</description>

      <description>05:58 Monday 30 October 2017 JST CB wants a presentation about the API. I started to explain how an API works and they seemed to know that, but they wanted to know how it&amp;rsquo;s set up. I have answered in terms of what I know and I hope that is enough for them to be satisfied.</description>

      <description>17:42 Wednesday 11 October 2017 JST 5:30pm meeting is underway, but I am only being asked questions via text while here at JB since they are doing it in Japanese (at CB).
17:47 I&amp;rsquo;m dialed in now.
17:51 They are asking how the API works. I explained it is like a web server which gives just data instead of data and HTML. They said they understand that, but how does it work?</description>
