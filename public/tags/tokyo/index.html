<p>Tuesday night <a href="https://www.mkpjapan.org">Tokyo Mankind Project</a> men&rsquo;s
circle met in Shinjuku for the first time in our hourly-rented space.</p>

<p>The space worked well, so I have booked it for the next three months&rsquo;
worth of Tuesdays.  It&rsquo;s clean, quiet, has cool chairs and beautiful
hardwood floor.  Plus it&rsquo;s only about 2 minutes from Shinjuku station,
so come on out!</p>

<p>We have not sorted out how the group will pay for it exactly.  We had
donations of 5500 yen last night, though the room cost around 7000
yen.  We are having discussions on LINE about each man donating 500
yen per week regardless of attendance.  That will hopefully encourage
men to attend.</p>

<p>Thanks to Lantz for replacing the battery and both fans in just 30
minutes at Loreatec.  (30 minutes after waiting a week for parts to be
shipped)</p>

<p>Machine works and is back to being <em>quiet</em>.  yay!</p>

<p>I met Dipendra today, a young man with design chops that far exceed my
own, and even Tariq&rsquo;s.  He is interested in doing the images for
<a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi">ConSwi, our swipe game</a> we
are making in Godot.</p>

<p>We met in a room that used to be a car showroom, but now features a
coffee shop because the car showroom was not making enough money.</p>

<p>I showed Dipendra how to get started with Godot and git.</p>

<p>Now headed home, but I will be back out tonight for Apocrypha, where I
will be telling my TJ Bike story of riding around Japan for 2 months.</p>

<p>Around 11am or so I hope to work on Marble Track 3.</p>

<p>The Mission Workshop was a great success last night, with 8 men in
attendance.  We tapped in to our Little Boys Deepest needs, then
visualized an ideal world with the needs met.  Where everyone has had
this deepest need met.  What kind of world is it?  _________,
___________, ____________.</p>

<p>Then we went back to this ideal world and found ourselves living
within it.  Not only living, but interacting and behaving in new ways
in this ideal world.  We noticed we are actually creating the ideal
world with our actions.  Connected with our little boy, bringing
action into create the perfect world where everyone&rsquo;s need is met.
What actions did you find yourself performing?  _________, _________,
_________.</p>

<p>You have found your Vision of an ideal world and your Action in this
world.  With this, we created Mission Statements.</p>

<p>I create a world of __________, __________, and ___________ by
_________, _____________, and ______________.</p>

<p>For me, <em>I create a world of love, safety, and connection by teaching,
inviting, and sharing.</em></p>

<p>Using the visualization and format above, feel free to create a
mission statement in this format and bring it to the next meeting.
We will be using them more often in the circle.</p>

<p>Today while I was in the cafe below Muza, a woman came up and asked if
I could speak English.  I drew her a map to a bank on the other side
of the station, but had a slightly bad feeling about sending her on a
possible wild goose chase.  Her name is Dipika, and she&rsquo;s been in
Japan just a little bit and will be here for 2 more weeks.  She didn&rsquo;t
exchange currency at the airport so she had no yen to buy a ticket,
and they don&rsquo;t take credit cards.  She&rsquo;s interested in finance, and
asked me my thoughts on Bitcoin once I told her I did computer stuff.</p>

<p>She said she&rsquo;s interested in China for the financial possibilities,
and I definitely agree; it seems Chinese economy is on the rise.</p>

<p>Anyway, I walked with her to the bank &hellip;. and discovered only ATM
machines were there.  She needed to talk to a person.  I misremembered
what street had her bank so we walked to the wrong street for a
different bank and then we were like bah and just went to Shinagawa
station where she could exchange her voucher to get her JR Rail pass.</p>

<p>The staff there spoke English enough to help her find a mobile wifi
provider, so we went there and got her hooked up with wifi for two
weeks.  Once she got some cash exchanged in Shinagawa, she paid me
back for the train ticket to Shinagawa from Kawasaki.  I gave her the
money back in exchange for updates during her adventures.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s hoping Dipika has a great trip!</p>

what we <em>can&rsquo;t</em> do.  He suggested putting some of the benefits on the

<p>It snowed &ldquo;today&rdquo; and was 2 degrees C all day long.  It&rsquo;s apparently
going up to 16 or 18 degrees C tomorrow.</p>

<p>I chatted with Delayna who I&rsquo;ve known since our mutual YRUU days back
in late 1980s, culminating with
<a href="https://new.robnugen.com/journal/1988/08/23/concon/">ConCon 1988</a>. Looking

<p>Back in Japan now, on a bus headed to Tokyo from Narita airport.  This
bus is cheap and does not include electrical outlets like some airport
trains do, but I have a bit of charge available on my computer (74%
(was 79% when I started))</p>

<p>Ah; I can write Japanese for my lesson on Thursday.</p>
