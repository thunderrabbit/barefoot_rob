      <description>13:39 Tuesday 07 November 2017 JST Okay it&amp;rsquo;s been a couple days, but we had a lovely weekend in Shimoda. So glad that Lin joined us! She said she had a great time. The weekend schedule was kinda freestyle, which caused a bit of consternation for some, but did not affect things too badly. I enjoyed getting to know everyone a bit better.
Yoga on Saturday morning was originally led by Lisa, but turned into acro yoga with people being angels, superman, partners, flippers, etc.</description>

      <description>23:57 Tuesday 12 September 2017 JST Just got home via taxi with Lin after eating ice cream with her near our station. I got Ben and Jerry&amp;rsquo;s cotton candy (which was similar to Baskin Robbin&amp;rsquo;s Popping Shower), and she got cherry by some other premium brand, the name of which escapes me now.
Lin and I took the same train from Noborito to our station. She had gotten on near Shinjuku, and we did not specifically plan to take the same train, but it worked out that way.</description>

      <description>01:43 Wednesday 30 August 2017 JST Hung out with Lisa and Jorge in Yoyogi park tonight. Had invited some other people, but they weren&amp;rsquo;t available for various reasons.
Lisa arrived first and she and I chatted until Jorge arrived. Kinda like a life-sized ouija board, we found a perfect spot in the grass beyond the lakes. Sat and chatted for four hours! Such a nice evening getting to know them better.</description>

      <description>18:47 Sunday 30 July 2017 JST Thanks to Rohini for inviting all the beautiful people who joined the Gunma adventure staying at Renee&amp;rsquo;s place.
Yesteray morning Lisa led yoga and later in the day she played an instrument with four strings. We tried doing some chanting with it, but no one knew the chants.
We went to the caves apparently dug by hand with a bunch of different statues (33?</description>
