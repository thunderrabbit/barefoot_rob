      <description>14:28 Saturday 08 July 2017 JST While preparing to post my question to /r/emacs, the power went off in our house. The circuit breaker flipped. Lin&amp;rsquo;s AC and my computer + monitors are apparently on the same circuit, which seems weird, but I guess it was not the neighborhood losing power.
Oh, so while my computer battery is still fine, I cannot post the post while the router has no power.</description>

      <description>12:34 Wednesday 28 September 2016 JST I came to CoCoIchiban curry place because the others I&amp;rsquo;ve visited featured electric outlets where my computer can sip the sweet sweet AC it craves from time to time.
I asked the waitress コンセントがありますか and she was like, &amp;ldquo;?????&amp;rdquo; as if I had said &amp;ldquo;yo yall gots outlets here?&amp;rdquo;</description>
