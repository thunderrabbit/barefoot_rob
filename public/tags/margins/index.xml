      <description>Margins
5:59pm CST Saturday 22 January 2000 How difficult could it be to write a message that automatically justifies its own margins? By &#39;automatic justification&#39; I mean that each line of a message would have the same number of characters in it. Then, viewing an automatically self-justifying message (with a fixed-width font), like the one you are reading now, results in an aesthetically pleasing experience. I saw such a message in 1994 during my days at University of Houston.</description>
