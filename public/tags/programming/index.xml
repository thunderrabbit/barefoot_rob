      <description>20:28 Thursday 20 December 2018 JST Super nice: I was able to figure out how to create a function to simplify the creation of web pages for Marble Track 3 Parts](https://www.marbletrack3.com/parts/). Now I just type C-c p in Emacs, then enter the title, tags, and shortcode to produce a file for a new Part in the Marble Track 3 website.
Today, with said shortcode, I started the page for Medium Catcher Below Triple Splitter.</description>

      <description>17:58 Thursday 29 October 2015 JST  override func tableView(tableView: UITableView, didSelectRowAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath) { NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter().postNotificationName(Constants.NotificationKey.SelectedWordFromList, object: nil, userInfo: [&#34;word&#34;: allVocabularyWords[indexPath.row]]) }  Now, I understand the code inside the function is a laugh and 1&amp;frasl;2, but it works and I&amp;rsquo;m leaving it until I know how to do it in a more canonical way. But anyway, highlighting words in the word list will now cause the words&amp;rsquo; deets to be displayed on the detail pane.</description>

I made the md5 cheater script, and want to augment it a bit to do something entirely different. I have never really programmed shell scripts, so we&amp;rsquo;ll see how it goes.
I wonder if I should search for Bash scripting tutorials or stay with more fundamental *nix code? I think I&amp;rsquo;ll go for Bash; this project ain&amp;rsquo;t very important, and I just want to get it done, plus I&amp;rsquo;m probably the only person who will use it, and I only use Bash.</description>

&amp;ldquo;All beautiful code starts ugly&amp;rdquo; was my mantra today as I hacked in some changes to the abstract search class. It now features a new function
 public function setRidiculousStationJoin($bool = true) { $this-&amp;gt;ridiculous_station_join = $bool; }  The search() function went from this
 protected function search($search_text = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;, $limit = 0, $page_num = 1){ return $this-&amp;gt;runSearchLimitOffset($search_text, $limit, $limit * (($page_num &amp;gt; 0) ?</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve realized that the obtuse requirements for a certain report will be a lot easier to create with temporary tables.
While digging around for info on temp tables, I found this gem of an DB example by Brian Hartsock:
CREATE TABLE `dogs` ( `id` INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, `name` VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (`id`) ) CREATE TABLE `legs` ( `id` INT(10) UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, `dog_id` INT(10) UNSIGNED NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (`id`) ) CREATE TABLE `nails` ( `id` INT(10) UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, `leg_id` INT(10) UNSIGNED NOT NULL, `last_clipped` datetime NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (`id`) )  Hooray for toenail ids!</description>

The first few apps we made were all separate projects. The apps were all similar, so I had a huge mess of code for making updates. Specs were all confuzzed in my head; code was all over the place, possibly changed, possibly not. Basically making updates wasn&amp;rsquo;t fun.
The most recent app started its life as a mess of blocks, which confuzzed iOS enough to keep crashing the app.</description>

Thanks to Matt&amp;rsquo;s suggestion of making the object instantiations look like a tree, I&amp;rsquo;ve got 楽しい発音 working without any pesky crashes caused by my confoozed way of using blocks. Today I actually added some functionality that was not in the previous version: now I can display sets of words instead of just all the words. Word.</description>

My crappy code featuring blocks was too convoluted for my brain to figure out how to make it all work, so now the project features a nice tree of classes with a ViewController at the top.
The Game class and GameView class don&amp;rsquo;t even know the other exists. Everything goes through the ViewController. GameView has an array of CardViews. Game has an array of Cards. The CardViews and Cards do not know the others exist.</description>

      <description>##23:11 Monday 11 March 2013
This weekend I mostly put together what I&amp;rsquo;m calling the 瞑想頑張れ meditation timer, which is a bit like referring to &amp;ldquo;ATM machines&amp;rdquo; but hey at least it&amp;rsquo;s two different languages.
It&amp;rsquo;s now available on github: 瞑想頑張れ at https://github.com/thunderrabbit/meiso-gambare.
There are several meditation timers on the app store, but I hadn&amp;rsquo;t found one with the unique feature I wanted.
Sometimes when I meditate, I really get into it and don&amp;rsquo;t want to stop when the original time is up.</description>

Tariq and I worked on the card game yesterday for about five hours. Lin was out with her aunt and uncle so I cooked the pizza Lin made so Tariq and I enjoyed that during our work time.
He suggested a complete overhaul of the side menu, that which was supposed to be &amp;ldquo;the same for all our card game apps.&amp;rdquo;
I was like moe joe at first, but after thinking about it a bit, the suggested solution does solve several problems, including UI and UX.</description>

I thought I already had __block before variables that needed it, but I did not.
Adding __block in two (2) places seems to have been the magic touch I needed.
However, I have to deal with Apple&amp;rsquo;s lovely provisioning process; I added Jimmy&amp;rsquo;s phone to the available devices and now the app won&amp;rsquo;t validate with Apple. gah
I get this super precise incredibly unhelpful error message:</description>

      <description>##20:39 Friday 08 February 2013
So I was using Ray Wenderlich&amp;rsquo;s Snap! tutorial as the basis for our new card game. Unfortunately, the app kept having random memory crashes. Tariq was sure it must be due to some too big images or corrupted sound files. I was sure it had to do with my naive use of blocks. Unfortunately, I was right.
I compared my code with the code in the tutorial and found that at no place did they use blocks in calls between classes.</description>

Tariq and I are creating a game of memory for iOS. This is my first project that uses blocks, and I must agree, they make coding a lot lot easier!!
This is my second big iOS project, a lot of which is based on Matthijs Hollemans&amp;rsquo; game Snap (currently without the multiplayer stuff), one of Ray Wenderlich&amp;rsquo;s excellent tutorials.
I&amp;rsquo;ve just gotten the in-game tutorial to work, though its alignment&amp;hellip; isn&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

Today at Tariq&amp;rsquo;s we worked about 4 hours so he bought pizza. Apparently this company is going to put ovens in the delivery vehicles so the pizza cooks on the way to the destination.
He made smaller icons for the menu and I incorporated them. Between arriving home and going to his house, I fixed the timer in each round. At his house, I added a ScoreView based on UILabel.</description>

Though we haven&amp;rsquo;t started thinking about a name, Tariq and I have pretty well fleshed out version one of our first card game (during our 10pm - 12am meeting tonight). He&amp;rsquo;s still got to create some assets, and I&amp;rsquo;ve still got to do a good amount of programming, but I can clearly tell that my iOS skillz have increased a lot since our first app.</description>

I wrote this on 750words this morning at 4am.
Just for fun (and because I need to head to work), I&amp;rsquo;ll leave it unedited:
I got a really good set of results from coding in iOS; I used blocks for the first time, incluidng typedef to make them more palatable syntax whise. I&amp;rsquo;ve got a view with a model and it all kinda started with Ray Wenderlich&amp;rsquo;s Snap example or whoever wrote that, but on his site, and I&amp;rsquo;m really thankful for the free stuff, so I believe I shall open source this thing Im making now, a countdown timer that does a visual color change while counting down and while ticking off the ticks by calling blocks sent by the insantiating objected.</description>
