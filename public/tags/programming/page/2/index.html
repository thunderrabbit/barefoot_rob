<p>I thought I already had __block before variables that needed it, but I did not.</p>

<p>Adding __block in two (2) places seems to have been the magic touch I needed.</p>

<p>However, I have to deal with Apple&rsquo;s lovely provisioning process; I added Jimmy&rsquo;s phone to the available devices and now the app won&rsquo;t validate with Apple.  gah</p>

<p>I get this super precise incredibly unhelpful error message:</p>

<p><a href="/images/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-02-09-at-11.04.25-PM.png"><img src="/images/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-02-09-at-11.04.25-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2013-02-09 at 11.04.25 PM" /></a></p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t quote it because I don&rsquo;t have a solution, but I&rsquo;ll be looking for the solution soon enough. (I can still submit ad hoc versions for our dev testers so I don&rsquo;t care until it&rsquo;s time to submit the app to Apple.)</p>

<p>So I was using <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/12735/how-to-make-a-simple-playing-card-game-with-multiplayer-and-bluetooth-part-1">Ray Wenderlich&rsquo;s Snap! tutorial</a> as the basis for our new card game.   Unfortunately, the app kept having random memory crashes.  Tariq was sure it must be due to some too big images or corrupted sound files.  I was sure it had to do with my naive use of blocks.  Unfortunately, I was right.</p>

<p>I compared my code with the code in the tutorial and found that at no place did they use blocks in calls between classes.  In my app, blocks between classes was a defining feature&hellip;  I still honestly don&rsquo;t know why that should make the app crash; in each case, I am sure the calling class still existed.  It didn&rsquo;t seem to be a case of zombie blocks either, where ARC keeps the block alive which keeps the caller alive, which keeps the block alive fo-eva-eva.</p>

<p>But crash it did, and now I&rsquo;m off to find some more block tutorials; I gotta get this stuff sorted as blocks seem to be a staple for iOS apps these days.</p>

<p>In my mind, the crashes were happening because the memory got all twisted up.  It reminds me of a lecture from one of my astronomy professors at UH.  He was explaining the rotation of the sun at its equator is faster than the rotation at the poles.  This causes a twisting of the magnetic fields which ultimately ends up with a reversal of the sun&rsquo;s poles.  But he said, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t know exactly why the sun&rsquo;s magnetic poles reverse; the best we can tell is that the magnetic field lines get so twisted up that the sun just gets <strong>mad</strong> and reverses its poles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tariq and I are creating a game of memory for iOS. This is my first project that uses blocks, and I must agree, they make coding a lot lot easier!!</p>

<p>This is my second big iOS project, a lot of which is based on <a href="https://twitter.com/mhollemans">Matthijs Hollemans</a>&rsquo; game <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/12735/how-to-make-a-simple-playing-card-game-with-multiplayer-and-bluetooth-part-1">Snap</a> (currently without the multiplayer stuff), one of <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/tutorials">Ray Wenderlich&rsquo;s excellent tutorials</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve just gotten the in-game tutorial to work, though its alignment&hellip; isn&rsquo;t. Yay for blocks and tutorials and screenshots!</p>

<p>Today at Tariq&rsquo;s we worked about 4 hours so he bought pizza. Apparently this company is going to put ovens in the delivery vehicles so the pizza cooks <em>on the way</em> to the destination.</p>

<p>He made smaller icons for the menu and I incorporated them. Between arriving home and going to his house, I fixed the timer in each round. At his house, I added a ScoreView based on UILabel.</p>

<p>Things to do include:</p>

<p>Though we haven&rsquo;t started thinking about a name, Tariq and I have pretty well fleshed out version one of our first card game (during our 10pm - 12am meeting tonight).  He&rsquo;s still got to create some assets, and I&rsquo;ve still got to do a good amount of programming, but I can clearly tell that my iOS skillz have increased a lot since our first app.</p>

<p>I probably shouldn&rsquo;t write skills with a z; I&rsquo;m miles away from where I might hope to be in a parallel universe.</p>

<p>The game will be a bit difficult!  We plan something like 10 levels, but only chimpanzees will likely be able to finish the higher levels.</p>

<p>I wrote this on <a href="https://750words.com/">750words</a> this morning at 4am.</p>

<p>Just for fun (and because I need to head to work), I&rsquo;ll leave it unedited:</p>

<p>I got a really good set of results from coding in iOS; I used blocks for the first time, incluidng typedef to make them more palatable syntax whise. I&rsquo;ve got a view with a model and it all kinda started with Ray Wenderlich&rsquo;s Snap example or whoever wrote that, but on his site, and I&rsquo;m really thankful for the free stuff, so I believe I shall open source this thing Im making now, a countdown timer that does a visual color change while counting down and while ticking off the ticks by calling blocks sent by the insantiating objected. The thing so far is three objects deep, with the MultiTimerView being the top, and then it instantiates a MultiTimer, which instntiates a plurality of Pausable Timers which themselves instantiate an NSTimer, and I don&rsquo;t know how deep it goes from there. but I am thinking I&rsquo;ll put these guys on github as soon as I have the , um, the shrinking aspect of the image down. I&rsquo;m hoping that I can just add one more timer and an animation of shrinkitude and have it work, but I might have to shrink and change colors with separate timers per each point of time. Not sure how the thing will react to two different threads asking the UIView waht to do.</p>
