This morning Colleen woke me up at 6:40 as I hoped to leave by 7am for the airport. I was shocked to know Ryan had already left; I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice him at all while I was sleeping.
I am grateful that Colleen woke me up after I had not set an alarm or anything; I was just able to conk out asleep last night and she handled all the details.</description>

Colleen had to wait an extra hour for me to go through immigration and customs in Seattle. Once we hung out, though, it was like no time had passed!
