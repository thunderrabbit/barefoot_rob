      <description>15:58 Monday 28 May 2018 JST HI Jackie! I would like to make a site for my ongoing project, Marble Track 3. I need some help kinda imagining how is best to present the info+content I have, plus I have a few ideas+constraints of how I think it should go. I think the site can be implemented as a static website with no backend coding required. (Except *possibly* for a section inviting people to get involved with the project.</description>

      <description>11:57 Wednesday 09 May 2018 JST Hey Nathan I am making a marble track, a.k.a. rolling ball track, similar to this one I made several years ago, visible here https://mt2.robnugen.com/ This time, however, I am not just making the track, I am also making a stop action animation of some characters making the track. Clips of the video so far are here https://mt3s.robnugen.com in a playlist. (No audio nor background yet; that is a whole other project (I asked you about Blender before)) The project is about 5% finished, and has taken a year to get this far.</description>

      <description>18:56 Saturday 19 August 2017 JST I am using my phone to give my PC access to the web, but it isn&amp;rsquo;t working, so I&amp;rsquo;ll save this email here.
Hi Alex This URL describes the directory structure that I would like to backup. https://helpwiki.evergreen.edu/wiki/index.php/Folder_Structure_-_Dragonframe I am currently using rsync over ssh to save it to my server, but I am open to having it backed up to mutlple places. I guess uploadcare uses its own filenames for each file that is uploaded.</description>

      <description>23:04 Wednesday 28 June 2017 JST Inbox Zero Activated.
I just use Stars to mark emails I want to process later.
Inbox started to go to hell while I was in Thailand and I never got back to zero until now.</description>
