<p>Actually not lunch, but after the NWTA meeting, I worked on AB and
then hung out with Tomoko from 2:05pm to 2:50pm.  Midori was off
today, so I didn&rsquo;t get to see her.  We talked about badminton and
Mari-chan, who is in the badmintion group and happened to be with
Tomoko when she let me in.</p>

<p>I worked for JB at three different locations around Kawasaki Station
today, as I do every Wednesday, at Solid Square, SSC, and JB main
office.  Solid Square lesson went pretty well; we drew mind maps of
our favorite places and then said a few sentences about them.  Then I
had a break during which I Marco Poloed with Richard from ae911truth a
bit and then worked on AB, nearly finishing this ticket since it
received a bit higher priority at our last meeting.</p>

<p>SSC featured lunch with Tomoko and then she reminded me of M&rsquo;s
birthday yesterday and bought a present &ldquo;from me&rdquo; which I wrapped.
Then lesson with Tomoko and head out to JB (via bus cause it&rsquo;s kinda
raining) and I spent some time working on AB and nearly nearly got the
ticket finished.</p>

<p>Four JB lessons each Wednesday: two lessons with kids and then two
with adults.  New student in the kids lessons is pretty genki, and may
have a good effect on the others.  We had them write some letters N+1
times and then practiced language &ldquo;I have a _____&rdquo; using different
plastic fruit.  We had tried &ldquo;I have a _____&rdquo; and &ldquo;I want a _____&rdquo; but
they kept getting &ldquo;have&rdquo; and &ldquo;want&rdquo; mixed up, so I switched it to only
&ldquo;have&rdquo; because I remember not being able to distinguish the words for
library and post office for a long time because I had learned them on
the same day.</p>

<p>In second class I used the same fruit to lay out a fake city, hoping
they would enjoy giving directions with fruit as landmarks.  It did
not work as well as I hoped; they prefered playing various sports with
the plastic fruits (which I can understand, but was frustrating for a
bit).  They finally got into it a little bit, but then <em>really</em> got
interested with Kazu brought in his computer with an animated game
version of giving directions.</p>

<p>In the third class, we used past perfect(?) e.g. &ldquo;I have worked in _____
for ____&rdquo; and &ldquo;I have lived in _____&rdquo; because the language pattern
came up in their banter at the beginning of classes.</p>

<p>In the fourth class, they were not saying much, and I was getting
tired, so I invited them to tell me their favorite fairy tale in
Japanese.  They told me the story of Peach Boy.  Their version seemed
to be missing a lot of possible sub-plots; I wonder how it was
originally written.</p>

<p>I have been writing this on the train from Yako to Tsudayama, and am
feeling super tired.</p>

<p>If I had my way, I would be magically transported home from here.
Thank god for Lin who usually picks me up from our station on
Wednesdays.</p>

<p>Tomoko did well in our lessons in the SSC.  She had to give a
presentation in English today.  Midori does not have to present as
soon so she is trying to memorize more, it seems.</p>

<p>Lessons were after we ate lunch together on the 4th floor.  I still
kinda feel like an outsider there, as if my face and Visitor badge are
flashing beacons.</p>
