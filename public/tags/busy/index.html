                        <p>(written 21:32 Wednesday 18 September 2019 JST)</p>

<p>Headed toward home on Nambu Line now after waking up at 4:30 (after
one sleep cycle) and doing my morning routine (write dreams, write
gratitude, meditate, brush teeth, etc) then headed to work in Kawasaki
for JB in Solid Square.  Sayuri came about 15 minutes late and was the
only student in attendance.</p>

<p>Headed to JR Kawasaki afterward to meet やなさん but he ended up
having to cancel for some reason.  I was a bit grouchy like why
couldn&rsquo;t he tell me ahead of time, but bah.</p>

<p>Got some food at a bakery and then headed to DiCE internet cafe and
slept for a couple of hours then ended up browsing Instagram and
clicking the little hearts because I heard that&rsquo;s what we gotta do
these days to make connections online.</p>

<p>After seeing Menya&rsquo;s post about too many calories, I was inspired to
have only one (1) cup of soft serve ice cream at the cafe (normally I
eat 3 or 4, easily).</p>

<p>Headed to JB school for kid lessons then adult lessons and wondered
about my place in my universe.  All the while, my blog entry is
brewing in my head.  I choose what I do (and no one else really
cares).  But I haven&rsquo;t really started the entry because of the message
in its title.</p>

<p>And also because my site is effed up now and I need to fix my theme to
work with latest version of Hugo (or something).</p>

<p>It looks like I am going to have to spend a day tracking down how to
make my site work again; I wrote to the main creator of Hugo, but no
reply.  When I posted on the forums last time, I ended up paying too
much for shoddy work that crept up in price.</p>

<p>Several different things on my day off today.  Mostly related to work,
where I realized the value of having a staging server with non-live
data.  &ldquo;Ohhh that is right; I tested saving data as well..&rdquo; when AB
was like, &ldquo;Um, where is the Azabujuban record?&rdquo; which had been renamed
to &ldquo;Doraemon 5e5433a38e2b035689a75c9ed11ffb0e&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once I fixed all of those (about 8 different records) based on the old
live DB which is still available at cli with <code>mysql</code> as root, I
watched episode 3 of The Naked Director.</p>

<p>This show is somewhat a comedy, but fills in my imagination of the
heady days before the bubble burst here in Japan.  I sometimes wonder
what it could have been like then, and this gives me a sense that I
would not have necessarily been better off for being here then.
Interesting to watch, though, and practice listening to Japanese.</p>

<p>I tried to do some more work, but was leaning toward porn after having
watched a shows which leans toward porn, so I took a nap.</p>

<p>Woke up and wrote down <a href="/journal/2019/08/30/dream-unstoppable-trains/">a dream about unstoppable trains</a>.</p>

<p><a href="//b.robnugen.com/journal/2019/dreams/20190830_165150_Dream_0000000249.jpg"><img src="//b.robnugen.com/journal/2019/dreams/thumbs/20190830_165150_Dream_0000000249.jpg" alt="20190830 165150 Dream 0000000249" /></a></p>

<p>And as I write this, I see the messy image and realize if I ever clean
up those images, I hope I either create redirects or think to fix the
links here.</p>

<p>Mohamed asked the URL for my journal, which is nice timing because
today is the first day for me to use ROBOT pages from August 29th,
which include writing a journal entry by default.  Again, this
directory and file structure leaves a lot to be
desired. <a href="https://b.robnugen.com/robot/2019/">https://b.robnugen.com/robot/2019/</a></p>

<p>I want to have OCR determine the dates of the pages and rename the
files based on those dates.  I have considered posting each page in
this journal stream, but I think it would be better to make an RSS
feed of them (but it would not get updated with each scan (if it was
tied only into this repo of entries)).  It should be a different RSS
feed, built just for b.robnugen.com</p>

<p>Today has seemed busy; my brain was spinning with what to do next for
a while this morning.  I ended up creating a new Part entry for Marble
Track 3 (tssfobls) before attending men&rsquo;s group meeting (Integration
Group Council).</p>

<p>Now I am on the way back from Tokyo station where I met Tariq and Jon
(for different reasons).  Tariq about ConSwi, and Jon to give him a
bag he left at our house.</p>

<p>I will hopefully be in time at home to attend Japanese lesson with
Mana at 3pm.  ギリギリかな。</p>

<p>Noborito station is next.  Looks like I will be home just in time.</p>

<p>Just a couple days ago I got my tickets all sorted to staff two
different NWTA weekends and also attend the MKP USA Face to Face
weekend in Texas.</p>

<p>After pretty much settling on the plans, it was pointed out that
attending an IGFT might give me more of the training I am looking for,
but I trust this is the training / trip I need.</p>

<p>The goal of all this is to deepen the (emotional) work we can do in
Tokyo Men&rsquo;s Circle, by improving my facilitation skills.  That will
thereby hopefully inspire more men to take facilitation roles in the
group.</p>

<p>In addition, we are beginning to translate one of the workshops into
Japanese so we can invite Japanese men into the work as well.  For
that part, I am asking Takeshi to lead and facilitate; maybe we should
do a trial run and then a small version, then a real version.</p>

<p>I can basically tell how busy I am by how much time I (don&rsquo;t) spend
writing in my journal.  Inverse relationship between entries and busy.
It&rsquo;s not surprising, but just a thing to note.</p>

<p>Recently, my &ldquo;journaling&rdquo; has included Marble Track 3 website, and
<em>that</em> has included revamping the website a bit.</p>

<p>I did MT3 livestream today, but have not made time to add an episode.</p>

<p>I attended online men&rsquo;s circle this morning, but was distracted with
emails.</p>

<p>Kevin&rsquo;s website is throwing memory errors, probably because old
version of site needs upgrading.  I contacted his provider about
getting it upgraded.</p>

<p>I am on the train headed to SCC, but forgot to bring my tea cup so I
probably have to use a paper cup (or go without tea).</p>

<h2 id="13-21-monday-27-april-2015-jst">13:21 Monday 27 April 2015 JST</h2>

<p>On my way home yesterday there was an ambulance and police car next to
traffic light near our house.  Lin&rsquo;s uncle was there and he goes
&ldquo;Lin&rsquo;s in the ambulance&rdquo;</p>

<p>!!!</p>

<p>Holy shit wait what?</p>

<p>I was so relieved to see her alert and essentially &ldquo;fine&rdquo; though it&rsquo;s
still super spooky fuck fuck fuck!</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t have my computer at the time so I didn&rsquo;t write about it last
night.</p>

<p>Right now she is talking to a guy from her insurance company I think,
explaining the situation.</p>

<p>For some reason, no one got the car driver&rsquo;s insurance information
last night, even though police were called and documented the
accident.</p>

<p>The lady said she didn&rsquo;t know the insurance info, and didn&rsquo;t give any
info except her own name and phone number.</p>

<p>She said she&rsquo;d have her insurance people call, but they haven&rsquo;t yet
(which is why I&rsquo;m starting to document this situation).</p>

<p>After the accident, Lin&rsquo;s mom and aunt happened across her; they were
going to eat dinner in the nearby restaurant.  I don&rsquo;t know when her
uncle arrived.  I arrived on my way home, saw him, and he told me to
go back to the ambulance.</p>

<p>Lin&rsquo;s mom and aunt were in there with her, and Lin said she&rsquo;d prefer
to have me with her and they went to dinner while Lin and I went to
the hosptial.</p>

<p>We were in the ambulance for a bit while they asked a couple questions
about allergies and sorted out an available hospital.  We went to
Saiwai Hospital in Kawasaki.</p>

<p>They took a CT scan which the radiologist said appears normal.</p>

but I&rsquo;ll probably fix that today.</p>
