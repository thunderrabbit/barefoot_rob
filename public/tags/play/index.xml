      <description>12:54 Friday 30 March 2018 JST Actually have gotten three (3) meetings done online: Prentiss and Ari helped with Mankind Project Tokyo; Ari said he will write some stuff for either Mankind Project Tokyo Meetup or My Power Circle. Oriane and I checked in with each other on our respective projects.
Planning to ask which inkan I can use for my personal seal today; maybe I will go do that now on my way to work at TY.</description>

      <description>09:35 Saturday 06 May 2017 JST Today I am going to Yurakucho to see Mika and Kai at an outdoor music festival. Kai will attend a concert that starts in 25 minutes.
I am probably planning too long of a day, but after the festival, I plan to go to Womb for a SOGO event. Only crummy thing is I have to wear shoes to the SOGO event. Not sure if it&amp;rsquo;s a Womb rule or a SOGO rule.</description>
