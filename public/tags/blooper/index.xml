      <description>20:56 Thursday 07 December 2017 JST I am quite happy with at least half of the frames I shot today. Fortunately, I am happy with the difficult ones!

After the ball hit the floor, I had the other characters react to the &amp;ldquo;sound&amp;rdquo;, but upon playback, they react too quickly.</description>
