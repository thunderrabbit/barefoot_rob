                        <p>So long as I do stuff within a normalized range, no one really cares
what I do.</p>

<p>I can spend all day trying to figure out one bug, or ignore it.  No
one will know the difference.  I could even quit my job, and just a
few people will notice.  (some people very much so, but 99+% will
not)</p>

<p>Re-reading the above sounds like I am suicidal, but I am not.  My
point is quite exactly the opposite.</p>

<p>I can wear shoes or not, and no one cares.  But I care.  I <em>love</em>
being barefoot 99% of the time, and am working toward doing it more.</p>

<p>I can work on Marble Track 3 or not; no one cares.  But I care!  I
<em>love</em> the project; I love talking about it, I love its steady
progress building up to something over time. I love the ridiculousness
of it; I love people&rsquo;s incredulous reactions when I say 1 second of
video took 2 hours to make (and it&rsquo;s going to be a lot higher, tbh..
2 hours per second is just for a <em>silent</em> video!)</p>

<p>I can stop doing workshops and no one cares..  But I care!  I did the
eye gazing workshop and it was great!</p>

<p>For some reason I have had (and still have) this fear that I cannot do
anything <em>different</em> from what I have been doing before, but this is
simply not true!  How untrue is it?</p>

<p>Just this past weekend I did stand a few minutes of up comedy for the
first time (with no prior practice nor planning) and it was fine; it
was easier than I expected.  I could do that, (or not, and no one
cares,) but I don&rsquo;t want to do that.</p>

<p>I want to put together a Silent Football game, though Rin has
recommended I focus on my Barefoot Rob brand first, but I don&rsquo;t wanna!
What should I do?  ergg this is so confusing.</p>

<p>Instead of being frustrated, can I instead see the steading progress
forward like on Marble Track 3?</p>

<p>This is an age-old question, and the answer seems to be it does not
really matter; just do what I want to do!</p>

<p>Oh XCode, you&rsquo;re so quirky.</p>

<p>You automatically change Images.xcassets, automatically <code>add</code> the
changes to git, AND automatically restore the changes after I revert
them.  This might be helpful if you did not <em>also</em> refuse to build the
app due to missing images.  I hate building iOS apps.  Utterly shit
experience all the fucking time.</p>

<p>Why do sandboxed users have to have difficult passwords?  I don&rsquo;t mind
good passwords for real users, but not for sandboxed users.  AND keep
your password requirements written near where we make the users.  I
had to look that shit up on Stack Overflow.  OH, so not only must it
be 8 characters, have numbers, lowercase and uppercase letters, we
cannot have consecutive letters, cannot have common passwords, and
something else?  Screw you and your password requirements for
sandboxed users Apple!   Why not do something like support your devs
by making a ChuckNorris password that we can all just use?</p>

<p>test@apple.com with password SteveJobs (or if we have to fit your lame
requirements Stev3Jobs) AND THEN JUST LOG IN!!   Use the Device ID to
distinguish who is whom.  Or even simpler, drop the requirements for
strong passwords for sandbox users!</p>

<p>Now that I got logged in, I get &ldquo;Transaction error: Cannot connect to iTunes Store&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mail.app wouldn&rsquo;t respond after Finder.app isn&rsquo;t loading.  I forced
relaunch of Finder, but it hasn&rsquo;t relaunched yet.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what I wrote to Apple when the dialog said &ldquo;oh you killed Mail app; do you
want to report it?&rdquo;</p>

<pre><code>Finder won’t start.

I don’t know if that’s affecting Mail, but I had to kill finder
because its one (1) single window couldn’t display ten (10) ten
little (less than 1MB each) images.  It just hangs with a blank
white page and spinning icon.  I can see the images with terminal;
I can see them with emacs.  I can see them with Cyberduck.  But
not Finder.

Why can’t I see them with Finder? 

I’ll stop here, but I swear on my million times I’ve yelled at my
computer I will never buy Apple gear again.
</code></pre>

<p>Funnily enough, I discovered I couldn&rsquo;t use Finder while I was trying
to upload a new icon to itunesconnect for our latest app.</p>

<p>Right now the <code>top</code> command is using the most CPU, at 10%.</p>

<p>Chrome is now locked up while trying to quick-look an image that I
think is the correct one I need to upload.</p>

<h2 id="10-29am">10:29am</h2>

<p>Hahah the clock in the top bar of OSX has stopped at 9:59:28.</p>

<p>So basically, the only things that are working correctly for me right
now are <em>not</em> Apple software: Emacs, iTerm (not Terminal), Middleman,
Hugo..</p>

<p>And it shows me that I have spent 30 minutes
trying/wanting/bitching-about-not-being-able to upload the image to
itunes connect.  Thanks Apple.</p>

<p><strong>8:44pm Tuesday 23 April 2013</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m trying to create a test account.  It&rsquo;s a test account, about which I do not care.  It cannot spend any real money; it&rsquo;s a test account.  BUT it has to have to have a real password, a birthdate, a first and last name, the last three of which are not used ANYWHERE.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s not why I&rsquo;m bitching.</p>

<p>When creating the test account, I tried to use the email address c at robnugen.com, but an error message said I had already used it.  No, I&rsquo;m pretty sure I haven&rsquo;t used it before.  I tried d; I tried e.  I tried asdf.  I tried fukcinggodamninfuriating, cause I&rsquo;m pretty sure I haven&rsquo;t used that one.  Apple assures me I have.</p>

<p><strong>6:52am Monday 22 April 2013</strong></p>

<p>A couple days ago I renewed my iOS developer account because our apps made <em>just</em> enough money to cover the cost of the developer account.</p>

<p>EVEN THOUGH the email address on my account has not changed, Apple sent me an email &ldquo;to complete my purchase&rdquo;  (wtf does that even mean?  My credit card was charged; the purchase has been completed!)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dear Nugen Rob,
To complete your purchase and access your Apple Developer Program benefits,
please click on the activation code below.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="/images/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-04-22-at-6.51.40-AM.png"><img src="/images/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-04-22-at-6.51.40-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2013-04-22 at 6.51.40 AM" /></a></p>

<p>So I clicked the link and it asked me to sign in. Why should I sign in when they sent me a confirmation link?</p>

<p>So I signed in and it asked me to enter my activation code.</p>

<p>wtf? Well maybe it lost its brain when I logged in. While still signed in, I went back to my email and clicked the link, which includes the code.</p>

<p><a href="/images/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-04-22-at-6.51.58-AM.png"><img src="/images/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-04-22-at-6.51.58-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2013-04-22 at 6.51.58 AM" /></a></p>

<p>THEY STILL WANT ME TO ENTER THE CODE!!!!</p>

<p><a href="/images/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-04-22-at-6.52.14-AM.png"><img src="/images/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-04-22-at-6.52.14-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2013-04-22 at 6.52.14 AM" /></a></p>

<p>Apple, please read Apple&rsquo;s &ldquo;User Experience Guidelines&rdquo; currently at <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/userexperience/conceptual/mobilehig/UEBestPractices/UEBestPractices.html">https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/userexperience/conceptual/mobilehig/UEBestPractices/UEBestPractices.html</a> (though I&rsquo;m sure that will change to a broken link in the future)</p>

<p>Anyway, Apple, please read your own UX Guidelines and fix the UX in your products. CLICKING A LINK IN EMAIL IS A SOLVED PROBLEM.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Summary: Email says &ldquo;click the link&rdquo; but resulting page says &ldquo;enter the code (which was in the link you just clicked)&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Steps to Reproduce:</p>

<p>1) buy a developer account.
2) develop apps for one year, without changing the email address a single time
3) renew the same developer account
4) get an email a few days later &ldquo;To complete your purchase and access your Apple Developer Program benefits, please click on the activation code below.&rdquo;
5) be required to log in
6) be forced to enter the code that was included in the link</p>

<p>Expected Results:</p>

<p>A) not have to click a link at all. I never once changed my email address; why is it sending me a link to my address?</p>

<p>B) not to have to enter the code that was in the link I clicked</p>

<p>Actual Results:</p>

<p>frustration that I paid 8000 yen and you&rsquo;re bothering me with crap and crappy UX</p>

<p>Regression:</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<p>I know it&rsquo;s not your fault, dear person who&rsquo;s reading this, but damn, Apple tells us to deliver a nice User Experience, but doesn&rsquo;t do the same for us.</p>

<p><strong>10:26pm Sunday 21 April 2013</strong></p>

<p>I apparently received an email on my iPhone.   When I unlock my phone, I have a screen that says so.  When I press the big green Dismiss button at the bottom, the screen persists.</p>

<p>So, either I have received 50+ messages (and have to press Dismiss for each one), or my iPhone is stuck in a loop out of which I cannot break without turning off my phone.</p>

<p>Granted, Ctrl-Alt-Del is the three finger salute of choice on Windows, so I guess its sibling can apply equally on iOS.</p>

<p>But srsly, I&rsquo;m so unimpressed with the UX in my Apple products that I&rsquo;m never going to buy another Apple device.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m trying to get some work done; I&rsquo;m trying to give my time and money to Apple so I have a chance to make a nickel.</p>

<p>Why is the provisioning process so obtuse?  Am I just an idiot who can&rsquo;t figure it out?</p>

<p>Why does Xcode have so many bugs?  Did I write it?</p>

<p>As I write this, Xcode is locked up.  Apparently I&rsquo;m going to have to force close it.</p>

<p>See how that little spinner isn&rsquo;t spinning in this image?  That&rsquo;s exactly how it&rsquo;s not spinning on my computer.</p>

<p>I may sound like Grampa on The Simpsons, but the interface to provide feedback to chase.com can be improved with just a few obvious tweaks.</p>

<p>Tweak 1) the form doesn&rsquo;t need to ask for my name, much less make it a required field; I&rsquo;m logged in ffs, so you have my name.</p>

<p>Tweak 2) fix the CSS; when I expand the textarea (thank you very much for that), the absolutely positioned line below it should move out of the way.</p>

<p>Tweak 1.5) the radio buttons preceeded by &ldquo;Would you like us to contact you?&rdquo; default to Yes, which is fine, but how are you going to contact me without my email address? Oh, you have it already right? Then why are you asking for my name?</p>

<p>Which brings me back to point 1: I&rsquo;m already logged in so I shouldn&rsquo;t have to type in my name!</p>

<p>Sincerely</p>

<p>Grampa</p>

<p>Whether it is the loss of a decent job, impossible conditions at work, rising prices, the threat of foreclosure or bankruptcy, the promise of endless war in Iraq and elsewhere, crumbling infrastructure, the elimination or slashing of social services and programs—US society is coming apart at the seams. None of the presidential candidates of the two big business parties is either willing or able to address these burning problems.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking this for most of the time I&rsquo;ve been in Japan; it&rsquo;s one reason I&rsquo;ve not wanted to go back. Usually I just say I don&rsquo;t want to support a government that&rsquo;s trying to kill the world. But that it&rsquo;s killing its own citizens is equally good reason not to go back. Killing in terms of letting Katrina victims die; crappy health care system; crappy education system; crappy use of energy; crappy etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Questions like these will continue as more and more religious astronauts travel into space. When is sunset in low Earth orbit if you&rsquo;re experiencing a dozen sunrises and sunsets in every 24-hour period? When does Sabbath begin on the moon, where the sun sets once a month? When is the first sighting of the crescent moon if you&rsquo;re on Mars? Religious councils of all faiths will have plenty to keep them busy for years.</p>

<p>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAA!!!</p>

<p>Yes, I realize I have used the term &ldquo;week&rdquo; in my religion, but I&rsquo;m going to go change it right now! Hahahahaha! Relax your rules, silly religions!</p>
