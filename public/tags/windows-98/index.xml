      <description>Installed Windows 98
20 July 1998
About a week ago, I got a Windows 98 CD and a new hard drive onto which to install it . My goal was to have three separate bootable partitions: Windows 95, Windows 98, and linux. Each time I tried to install Windows 98, it tried to overwrite Windows 95. I didn&#39;t want that because I don&#39;t trust Microsoft to have written a good enough OS that I&#39;ll want to keep it.</description>

      <description>Windows 98
20 July 1998
Well, I haven&#39;t heard from Thomas to help me get Windows 98 off of my machine here, so I decided to use it. I got my connection to Flashnet going easily enough, and got Netscape Communicator configured, but I have no frikkin&#39; idea what Windows Messaging means by my &#34;post office&#34; &#34;Please enter the path to your post office,&#34; it says. What? What the hell are you talking about?</description>
