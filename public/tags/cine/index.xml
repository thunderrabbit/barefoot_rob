      <description>18:44 Wednesday 19 August 2015 JST Actually, her name is Francine, so &amp;ldquo;Cine&amp;rdquo; is pronounced &amp;ldquo;seen&amp;rdquo; as an easier option for Japanese speakers to say than フランシーン.
We just finished lessons in Fukuura for JB. Chris was supposed to teach, but he&amp;rsquo;s apparently not fully back from vacation haha.
Francine seems to always have creative fun lessons for her classes. Plus she just went through Berlitz training and said she learned a lot.</description>
