      <description>06:19 Monday 12 November 2018 JST There is a morning exercise routine used by Japan to help build community and health and prepare everyone for the day. Even though it has been used in Japan for a minute, it has not spread outside Japan.
Today after SOGO, Menya and Risa led us through the first stages of changing all that. They had multiple cameras and awesome music. Video is coming Wednesday.</description>
