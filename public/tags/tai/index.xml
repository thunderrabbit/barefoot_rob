      <description>17:08 Sunday 23 July 2017 JST I missed SOGO 4 weeks in a row, and will miss it again next week, but I enjoyed being back today! Saw Kai while walking near Harajuku station so got to say HI to her for a bit. Super glad that she has been enjoying the workout as well. She met Tai while there, so they enjoyed having rhyming names.</description>
