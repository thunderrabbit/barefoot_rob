      <description>As a programmer, I often want things to be just right, finding that balance between maintainability, extensibility, and plain ol&amp;rsquo; get-&amp;lsquo;er-done. Today, banging my head against unexpected walls while trying to spin up a virtual machine with Vagrant, I had to keep my focus on the goal at hand: Keep the website up while migrating from PHP 5.7 on Ubuntu 14 to PHP 7.2 on Ubuntu 18.

David Hu  I work from 9:30 - 6:30 I start by journalling 1 page on: why, what, and how. I come up with 1 “wildly important goal” that I schedule my day around. I spend 10 mins on my morning checklist — scheduling the day, checking calendar, quick check of Slack, status update.</description>
