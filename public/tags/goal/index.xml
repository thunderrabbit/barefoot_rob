      <description>11:18 Wednesday 27 July 2016 JST 1 page on why, what, and how
oh my goodness this is embarassing to write on my online journal. Fortunately I only have 1 reader, and he&amp;rsquo;s probably gotten bored and wandered away.
I know for a fact that I won&amp;rsquo;t keep this up every day, but the why is currently related to productivity, which is related to thinking I did something good, which is related to thinking that I&amp;rsquo;m good.</description>
