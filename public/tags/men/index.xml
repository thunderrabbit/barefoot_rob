      <description>08:48 Thursday 10 January 2019 JST Men,
Back when I joined Mankind Project in 1997, the New Warrior Training Adventure was the only way to get started in Mankind Project.
Attending the weekend was a life changing experience for me. It was on that weekend that I realized I was a man. It was during that weekend that I began to get over my fear of men.
Over the years, as an organization, Mankind Project has begun encouraging new men to sit in Open Circles (like the one we have in Tokyo) before attending the New Warrior Training Adventure (NWTA).</description>

      <description>12:22 Wednesday 17 January 2018 JST We had a great meeting last night with seven men in the circle.
This month has 5 Tuesdays, so normally we would skip the 5th Tuesday.
This month we will have a meeting on the 5th Tuesday.
Soon I imagine we will meet every Tuesday and have the co-gender group meet on a different day.</description>
