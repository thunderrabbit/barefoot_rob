                        <p>I am excited about Remembering Past Lives workshop today</p>

<p>(written 17:13 Thursday 12 September 2019 JST:)</p>

<p>Two people in attendance and had a good time!  Great to hear their
questions at the beginning.  One was &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the process?&rdquo;</p>

<pre><code>Each participant gets into a relaxed position, usually either sitting
in a chair, or laying down, or otherwise sitting against something
comfortable.

I will spend a few minutes leading you through a relaxation process,
whereby you let your body relax and keep your mind awake.  Once you
are in this mind awake / body asleep mode, I'll invite you to imagine
getting up and leaving the room.  In your mind I will guide you to
travel far away, whether by vehicle, or through a cave, or through a
forest and arrive somewhere familiar.

I will give you a chance to explore the familiar area, including
seeing other inhabitants of the area and moving around and
communicating with them.

I will lead you gently back the way you came, allowing you to have
clear memory of what happened and what you heard and saw.  Once your
awareness focuses back on your physical body, you will have a chance
to write down what you heard and saw.  We will not speak until
everyone is pretty much done writing.

The whole process is a state of light hypnosis, and you will still
have full control and awareness of where your physical body is.  You
will be able to come back in a moment's notice if you choose.

Each process will take about 20 or 30 minutes.
</code></pre>

<p>One participant saw the same place in two of the three excursions we
did.  The other saw some of the same imagery twice, but did not report
as clear of a vision of the place itself.</p>

<p>All in all, a great time!</p>

<p>I felt really happy to hear Misato with her eyes wide, say &ldquo;a dreamcatcher!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Today was a long day, starting with recording a first draft of a video
for my first GoFundMe campaign, then two TY lessons, two MKP meetings,
lunch with Tomoko, then an hour chillin with &ldquo;a flower in each hand&rdquo;
behind the desk of the Sweets Party Attendants, having a non-lesson
with them because they have nothing going on.</p>

<p>During this non-lesson, Tomoko showed me her &ldquo;personal こたつ&rdquo; which
consisted of a heater under her desk and a blanket strategically
arranged to drape down over her legs.  I showed them the latest MT3
video clip,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&amp;video_id=OHCg01--Zsc">cut and glued 7th outer spiral support</a>.
M&rsquo;s comment was (something like) 「思ったより短い」(but she translated
it as &ldquo;not as much progress as I expected&rdquo;, so I know my adjective is
wrong in Japanese).  Tomoko said she would work on translating more of
the website.  I knew I was stretching it to invite her to (create a
Github account, learn git and) do pull requests (but I tried anyway,)
and when she saw the source code of a page she commented 「難しい！」
so I apologized and thanked her for anything she could do.</p>

<p>Then headed to JB where we practiced &ldquo;Happy New Year&rdquo; with kids
lessons and played a variant of UNO targeting adjectives, animal
names, body parts, and a
couple semantic rules:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see a red nose; I play a red dog&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then with the adults in my 8pm class things like &ldquo;I see a reindeer
with brown antlers; I play a tiger standing in front of brown trees&rdquo;
and culminating with Hide&rsquo;s &ldquo;I see an elephant standing on yellow sand
and wearing a yellow ribbon; I play an elephant standing on yellow
sand and wearing a yellow ribbon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then with the adults in my 9pm class all calling in absent, I got to
head home early.  I am one station from Noborito now when the class
would just be finishing.</p>

<h5 id="21-56-wednesday-09-january-2019-jst">21:56 Wednesday 09 January 2019 JST</h5>

<p>And now I would be just a station or two from Noborito, but Lin and I
are home.  yay!</p>

<p>Super nice: I was able to figure out how to create a function to
simplify the creation of web pages for Marble Track 3
Parts](<a href="https://www.marbletrack3.com/parts/">https://www.marbletrack3.com/parts/</a>).  Now I just type <code>C-c p</code>
in Emacs, then enter the title, tags, and shortcode to produce a file
for a new Part in the Marble Track 3 website.</p>

<p>Today, with said shortcode, I started the page for
<a href="/p/mcbts">Medium Catcher Below Triple Splitter</a>.</p>

<p>Exciting MKP Tokyo news!</p>

<p>I sent this to my online Integration Group.</p>

<pre><code>I just got confirmation: I will be co-facilitating a 3-week online
MKP introduction called The Men's Work https://mkpusa.org/themenswork/
with Paul Newell, who is currently co-facilitating it in the US.

On Fridays, 7pm - 8:30pm (Japan time), November 3rd, 10th, and
17th, we will do this online training for men in Tokyo.

Once we run this 3 week series of meetings a couple of times, I
will create a new men's circle in Gotanda (Tokyo) on Fridays for
men who are interested.  Once those Gotanda men have sat in circle
for a few months, I will do a Mission Statement workshop with
them.

Once we have two circles humming along, I plan to invite an MKP
man from overseas to Japan to teach facilitation skills to men who
are interested.  My want is to get more and more circles started
in Japan so we can create a groundswell movement to have enough
energy to do NWTAs here in Japan.

<p>We have arrived back in Haneda and are in a taxi back home.  Didn&rsquo;t
realize trains would not be running very late so yay for 12000 yen for
stale smoke flavored taxi.</p>

<p>Last train was at 11:51 and would require two transfers, including
from KQ Kawasaki to JR Kawasaki station.</p>

<p>I get to work on MT3 tomorrow yayyy!</p>

<p>Last night I met Kai and Mika 久しぶり！We met near Mika&rsquo;s work for
dinner (I got lost on the way due to trusting Google maps which had
been given incorrect input, and ended up taking a taxi (only 410 yen
(wow!)) after realizing I had walked wayy off course) and then got ice
cream whereupon they suggested I do something crazy.</p>

<p>In July, there will be an event where untrained people can <em>conduct</em>
an orchestra!</p>

<p>My first reaction is holy shit no way because I have no idea what I&rsquo;m
doing everyone will laugh it will suck&hellip; wait a minute.  where is all
this fear coming from?</p>

<p>I trust Kai and Mika.  They say it will be fun so by golly I am going
to apply!</p>
