      <description>I got AB&amp;rsquo;s server upgraded from unsupported Ubuntu 12 to Ubuntu 18. Now running PHP 7 instead of unsupported 5.6 Now running RDS instead of MySQL on EC2.
Not yet running ALB, but AWS tech team is looking into why the application was sometimes throwing 502 errors when I routed requests through ALB.</description>

      <description>I am excited about Remembering Past Lives workshop today
(written 17:13 Thursday 12 September 2019 JST:)
Two people in attendance and had a good time! Great to hear their questions at the beginning. One was &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the process?&amp;rdquo;
Each participant gets into a relaxed position, usually either sitting in a chair, or laying down, or otherwise sitting against something comfortable. I will spend a few minutes leading you through a relaxation process, whereby you let your body relax and keep your mind awake.</description>

      <description>20:42 Wednesday 09 January 2019 JST Today was a long day, starting with recording a first draft of a video for my first GoFundMe campaign, then two TY lessons, two MKP meetings, lunch with Tomoko, then an hour chillin with &amp;ldquo;a flower in each hand&amp;rdquo; behind the desk of the Sweets Party Attendants, having a non-lesson with them because they have nothing going on.
During this non-lesson, Tomoko showed me her &amp;ldquo;personal こたつ&amp;rdquo; which consisted of a heater under her desk and a blanket strategically arranged to drape down over her legs.</description>

      <description>20:28 Thursday 20 December 2018 JST Super nice: I was able to figure out how to create a function to simplify the creation of web pages for Marble Track 3 Parts](https://www.marbletrack3.com/parts/). Now I just type C-c p in Emacs, then enter the title, tags, and shortcode to produce a file for a new Part in the Marble Track 3 website.
Today, with said shortcode, I started the page for Medium Catcher Below Triple Splitter.</description>

      <description>19:53 Friday 05 October 2018 JST Exciting MKP Tokyo news!
I sent this to my online Integration Group.
I just got confirmation: I will be co-facilitating a 3-week online MKP introduction called The Men&#39;s Work https://mkpusa.org/themenswork/ with Paul Newell, who is currently co-facilitating it in the US. On Fridays, 7pm - 8:30pm (Japan time), November 3rd, 10th, and 17th, we will do this online training for men in Tokyo. Once we run this 3 week series of meetings a couple of times, I will create a new men&#39;s circle in Gotanda (Tokyo) on Fridays for men who are interested.</description>

I wrote this to them:
Super Pumped and realllllly happy that you guys are considering making SSL the DEFAULT for all sites!</description>
