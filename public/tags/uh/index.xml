      <description>experiencing University of Houston
25 August 1998
Yesterday my friend Sarah invited me to say HI to her at 4pm at Camp Guerin at University of Houston. I was almost embarassed that I had to ask, &#34;which one is Camp Guerin?&#34; (She told me it&#39;s the one by PGH.) &#34;Oh yeah!&#34; So today I took a nap and perfectly woke up at 3:40 and drove out to UH. Wow. Nostalgic feelings rushed toward me at 60 miles per hour on the highway.</description>
