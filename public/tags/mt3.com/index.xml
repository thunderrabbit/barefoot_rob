      <description>08:09 Tuesday 07 May 2019 JST Now that I will not likely add any more shortlinks to Marble Track 3 website, I have been expanding them in the markdown, which will save a redirect each time people click on the links.</description>

      <description>08:57 Monday 06 May 2019 JST Atom editor has a way to write my own autocomplete rules. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a link handy, but it is handy for making links.
So I have a two part approach:
 create a file with Emacs by entering a Title (part name), Shortcode, Image, Tag(s), and date. Emacs creates the new file as part_name.md and now appends to the Atom file ~/.atom/snippets.cson the information necessary to let Atom auto complete the markdown after I type the shortcode.</description>
