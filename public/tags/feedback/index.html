<pre><code>FEEDBACK from Co-coordinator no. 1 (responsible for finding,
promoting to, communicating with, and bringing 18 people), with
input from several Guests

· VALUE: 13,000¥ would be appropriate if guests had their OWN
    ROOMS (and could have done proposed activities…).  Not
    appropriate for dorm-style sleeping.

· OVERPRICED: also in proportion to services provided.  What made
    price acceptable to the group were the activities we provided
    ourselves (own van from and back toTokyo &amp; around Gunma,
    professional yoga, games, meditation, music…)

· BABY-SITTING SHOULD NOT BE GUESTS’ RESPONSIBILITY: When asked to
    give the guest a break from their child, it should be heeded.
    (It was ignored.)

· GUESTS SHOULD NOT BE CONSCRIPTED TO COOK, CLEAN, or SERVE,
    (especially when paying 13,000¥ for the weekend).

· NOT KEEPING TO THE SCHEDULE: Dr. Wada’s treatments had been
    scheduled for 2-5 p.m., but without asking co-organizers or
    group, these went on until past midnight. Could not then do
    group afternoon activities proposed (like making Kokeshi /
    daruma…)

· SUNDAY BREAKFAST FINISHED in AFTERNOON, -Host started late, and
   chose to cook waffles, by herself.  Hungry guests jumped in,
   hoping to be fed sooner.  An atmosphere of scarcity and
   confusion about the day’s activities ensued.

· DELAY meant we could not do any of the Lake Haruna activities
    that had been promised/proposed for Sunday.

· GUESTS’ NEEDS NOT MET; Some guests felt shut down and
    disrespected when they had Qs (i.e.. about breakfast, or
    packing up) Particularly noticeable in a highly
    service-oriented country such as Japan.  RESPECT &amp; DIGNITY
    toward guests LACKING.

· PAYMENT DEMANDED BEFORE ACCOUNTING COMPLETE: As 18 people
    getting restless at being 3 HOURS behind schedule. payment
    could have been completed at any other moment, so
    co-organizers could check the bill.  Host adamantly refused.
    Due-diligence very difficult; Felt like EXTORTION.

· OVERCHARGED &amp; NO RECEIPT: Host reneged on her promise of free
    room for co-organizers, but had neglected to inform them.
    Discovered upon return home.  One guest was also charged 2
    nights when she only stayed one.

· HOST HAD WANTED GROUPS and asked for the business.
    Co-organizers had genuinely wanted to help, and worked very
    hard to do so. But even with 18 people, not one person was
    discounted.

· SHUNGITE OR NATURE EXCURSIONS should be promoted.  NOT BOTH.
    Those who came to be out in nature felt short-changed.

Conclusion: co-coordinator no. 1 would NOT recommend this host,
ESPECIALLY not for groups, or foreigners.
[Host’s priority seems to be cash, not guests.]

Even though we thoroughly enjoyed each other’s company, enjoyed
nature when we DID get out, and the activities we DID get to do,
all while respecting their rules, co-coordinator no. 1 felt
disrespected, shut down, unappreciated, and frustrated that she
could not provide her guests what had been promised.

Maybe hosts will improve with experience, and with feedback?  We
genuinely hope so!

Coordinator number 2 thinks the schedule not being maintained
caused problems with the guest experience. For example, not
adequately preparing/planning for breakfast, and creating an
atmosphere of scarcity on Sunday morning. Or confusion with
activities for the day.

<pre><code>Renee is requesting ¥ 21000

Jul 28-30 · Japanese Beauty near Hot Springs (Single bedroom)

Airbnb has been informed of the numerous damages caused to our
property's reputation in the area and misconduct of you, Rob, as
the responsible party for the unregistered guests you brought on
my property, and the post-stay time-consuming issues created by
slander on your and Rohini's part. They have a file on this case
and recommend that I put a financial amount to the intangible
damage incurred. If you choose not to pay the requested amount in
a timely manner, which is the stated damage deposit on your
reservation, they will intervene.

<p>Because the review no longer shows up on her profile, I assume they
took it down because she disputed it.  Therefore any damages to her
property&rsquo;s reputation are negligible.</p>

<p>Given that
<a href="/journal/2017/07/01/met-ren%C3%A9e/">I already gave her 20,000 yen</a>,
I choose to call it even.</p>

<p>This is what I wrote soon after the weekend, in case it matters: <a

<p>My response to Renee</p>

<pre><code>HI Renee!

I was going to just pay it, but was unable to verify the credit
card information.  As far as I can tell, the review no longer
appears on your profile, so there is no damage to your property's
reputation.

Let's just call it even.

<pre><code>HI Sam

On this URL: https://my.atlassian.com/products/index

I see a sideways &quot;Leave Feedback&quot; button (div) on the right side
of my browser.

I wanted to leave feedback that the processes for creating license
keys for SourceTree took about 15 or 20 seconds, which I think is
slow enough that people might give up and stop using your product.

BUT, when I clicked on Leave Feedback, the window that appears
only has space for name and email.  I click [submit] and it gives
an error message:

Oops! Something went wrong...
Value of summary field is either missing or too long.
You must specify a summary of the issue.
Don't worry though! We've logged this problem and will look into it soon!

Before this experience, I had the impression that Atlassian and
all its products were great, rock solid, etc etc.  I really like
the Atlassian brand.  But now I'm like O_o.

- Rob!
