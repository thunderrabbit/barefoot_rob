      <description>Hello
I have a rather large Hugo site which I have pared down into one bite sized repository.
I made some tweaks to the top page to only show Page type Blog (in content and in pagination)
There are also page type. journal which I would like to be displayed under /journal
This all worked a few versions of Hugo ago.
I upgraded Hugo to 0.58 recently and it stopped working.</description>

      <description>21:44 Saturday 04 May 2019 JST In my workflow, I end up with image URLs like this
https://b.robnugen.com/art/marble_track_3/track/parts/2019/2019_may_03_caret_splitter_rudder_planner_3.jpg  and I want to convert them to markdown with thumbnail like this:
[![2019 may 03 caret splitter rudder planner 3](//b.robnugen.com/art/marble_track_3/track/parts/2019/thumbs/2019_may_03_caret_splitter_rudder_planner_3.jpg)](//b.robnugen.com/art/marble_track_3/track/parts/2019/2019_may_03_caret_splitter_rudder_planner_3.jpg)  (N.B. the title came from the image filename, and thumbs/ has been inserted into the thumbnail&amp;rsquo;s URL)
With Emacs, I can do it with a custom keyboard macro, which starts by moving point to the end of the image URL then I-search backward to find the last / in the URL.</description>
