<p>But the weather was reasonably warm for the season.  Quite overcast,
though we saw the moon peek through a few times.</p>

<p>haha remember PEEK and POKE in BASIC?</p>

<p>Lance and I were just in the free massage chairs for around an hour
after we bathed in the 24 hour お風呂.  My massage chair inflated
balloons at various points, whereas I think his used rollers to
massage.</p>

<p>We talked about free energy, Kissinger and Vietnam, fiat currency,
Germany wanted its gold back (sorry charlie), JFK, 911, and a couple
others I forgot.</p>

<p>Haha I just realized I haven&rsquo;t taken a shower since the night before
last.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m on Nambu Line headed to Tachikawa, at which point I&rsquo;ll have about
20 minutes to get a ticket for the next train.  Hopefully the ticket
line will be shorter than in Kawasaki!</p>

<p>Lin walked with me to Kawasaki station and waved byeeee as I headed
down the steps to the train.</p>

<p>In 東神奈川 station, I got some snacks and headed down to the
platform, from where I saw two excited kids on the train at the next
platform.  They were looking around to see what they could see, so I
waved to them and they waved back and said whatever they said about
some stranger waving to them.  They were on a local train, so my train
arrived before theirs left.  We waved again once I had gotten on my
train; we were now more than a meter closer together and only 1 meter
apart (including two panes of glass and a gap between the trains).</p>

<p>In other news, I emailed JB to see if he knows a Japanese teacher who
lives near me.</p>

<p>We had a few beeps from the radar detector, a few squeaks from the
magnetometer, and several orbs in photos taken by Esther.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sleeping down in the meditation room under the pyramid.</p>

<p>On the train now headed to something-Ichinomiya station in Chiba.</p>

<p>Should arrive in Chiba station at 12:36 and then I&rsquo;ll hop onto another
train for 40 minutes or so.</p>

<p>##19:04 Saturday 17 January 2015</p>

<p>Great food at Boba cafe in Ishinomia.  Artist Hannah Sata had some
great pieces up in the loft.  Yeah, I can see how the guy last night
said mine look like amateur toys.</p>

<p>##02:25am Sunday 18 January 2015</p>

<p>Just now back at the crib.  I wore two pairs of socks, hiking boots,
underwear, long underwear, long jeans, sweat pants, rain pants,
t-shirt, blue jacket, YRUU hoodie, LRG hoodie, my rain jacket, big
overcoat, neck warmer, knit hat, and nice gloves.  Everything was warm
except the three middle toes on my right foot.</p>

<p>##03:07</p>

<p>Just took a shower with alternately cold, warm, scalding water; it
made me appreciate our consistently warm water at home!  Then ofuro
(bath) in a lonng wide tub, which could easily fit four people.</p>

<p>I basked in the water, letting my body float, with water periodically
covering my (closed) eyes as I breathed through my nose.</p>

<p>The bath had thin foam sheets floating on top of the water for
insulation.  I swam underneath them on my way out of the tub.</p>

<p>I forgot my toothbrush in the girl&rsquo;s room; we had used that room for
orientation and such, and due to some shuffling, Asuka is sleeping
there but we three guys are sleeping in the next room.  (Originally
she was going to sleep here.)  Anyway, my toothbrush is over there.
Moe joe fuzzy teeth.</p>

<p>Out in the field, we did meditation, then a visualization to show the
ETs where we are located.</p>

<p>We saw a few falling stars, but nothing else obvious.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m writing now because I just came back to the cabin to get the main
laser pointer.</p>

<p>##02:55 Sunday 23 November 2014 JST##</p>

<p>We just arrived back in our cabin.  Saw lots of flashes in the sky,
like the whole sky lit up just for a twentieth or 100th of a second,
about maybe 20 times over the course of nearly 5 hours we were out
there.</p>

<p>Also saw many shooting stars, though not more than I might expect in a
night.</p>

<p>We recorded audio from the evening on my phone. I&rsquo;m not sure how to
transfer it from my phone to my computer though.</p>

<p>Wake up time in 5.5 hours.</p>

for hours last night.</p>

<p>Four guys in this cabin; one has already completely packed and made
his bed (he used to be in military, apparently).  Another guy is
nearly packed, and another is taking a shower, And I&rsquo;m just here type

course!</p>

<p>Okay gotta pack and go bye.</p>
