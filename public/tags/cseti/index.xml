      <description>03:35 Sunday 22 November 2015 JST But the weather was reasonably warm for the season. Quite overcast, though we saw the moon peek through a few times.
haha remember PEEK and POKE in BASIC?
Lance and I were just in the free massage chairs for around an hour after we bathed in the 24 hour お風呂. My massage chair inflated balloons at various points, whereas I think his used rollers to massage.</description>

      <description>12:11 Saturday 21 November 2015 JST Haha I just realized I haven&amp;rsquo;t taken a shower since the night before last.
I&amp;rsquo;m on Nambu Line headed to Tachikawa, at which point I&amp;rsquo;ll have about 20 minutes to get a ticket for the next train. Hopefully the ticket line will be shorter than in Kawasaki!</description>

Lin walked with me to Kawasaki station and waved byeeee as I headed down the steps to the train.
In 東神奈川 station, I got some snacks and headed down to the platform, from where I saw two excited kids on the train at the next platform. They were looking around to see what they could see, so I waved to them and they waved back and said whatever they said about some stranger waving to them.</description>

We had a few beeps from the radar detector, a few squeaks from the magnetometer, and several orbs in photos taken by Esther.
I&amp;rsquo;m sleeping down in the meditation room under the pyramid.</description>

Great food at Boba cafe in Ishinomia. Artist Hannah Sata had some great pieces up in the loft. Yeah, I can see how the guy last night said mine look like amateur toys.</description>

Out in the field, we did meditation, then a visualization to show the ETs where we are located.
We saw a few falling stars, but nothing else obvious.
I&amp;rsquo;m writing now because I just came back to the cabin to get the main laser pointer.
##02:55 Sunday 23 November 2014 JST##
We just arrived back in our cabin. Saw lots of flashes in the sky, like the whole sky lit up just for a twentieth or 100th of a second, about maybe 20 times over the course of nearly 5 hours we were out there.</description>
