      <description>16:40 Saturday 30 December 2017 -02 We are going to get on the flight in several hours from now. I wonder when I will start to reverse my sleep schedule. We are 11 hours behind Tokyo, so not as far away as possible, but close.
I have just gotten out my computer (to work on ConSwi) when I realized I should be sleeping.</description>

      <description> 05:37 Friday 29 December 2017 I woke up at 5am today; did we go to sleep too early?
07:50 Friday 29 December 2017 I don&amp;rsquo;t know, but I used the time to finish a big step in ConSwi. Now the player can win levels.

      <description>07:29 Saturday 16 December 2017 -02 Good morning from SÃ£o Paulo! My jetlag seems fine, though we are in a timezone opposite that of Japan, where it is 6:30pm Saturday according to https://time.is/Tokyo
My techique is to switch my clocks to my destination time as soon as I get onto the airplane, and then sleep or stay awake during the flight according to the target schedule.
The more timezones changed, the longer the flight and therefore more time available to do the switch.</description>
