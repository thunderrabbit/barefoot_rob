<p>Played with the nephews in the pool for a couple of hours.  Activities
included:</p>

<ul>
<li>entering the pool with various techniques</li>
<li>counting consecutive successful toy catches</li>
<li>bouncing an empty 2 liter bottle</li>
<li>launching said bottle</li>
<li>riding on jacuzzi cover like a raft</li>
<li>filling 2 liter bottle with bubbles from jacuzzi</li>
<li>jumping into pool for distance</li>
</ul>

<p>But most importantly, no one got hurt</p>

<p>I just got out of the lukewarm jacuzzi because it just didn&rsquo;t seem to
be getting any hotter.  The thermostat or something is broken so it
won&rsquo;t heat, so we taped a hose to the nearby shower faucet and put it
on full hot, which was too hot to touch at first, but then seemed to
get asymptotically close to the jacuzzi temperature, which never broke
32 degrees C.</p>

<p>Still had fun, and funny that the jacuzzi top float on the pool,..
floatiy enough for Rodrigo to sit on it.</p>

<p>Hung out with Kai and Mika near Mika&rsquo;s work tonight.  They gave me a
stack of flyers to hand out for a show that Mika and Kai will be
staffing on Monday.  Thanks to Mika for sending my medium rare burger
back to be recooked to well done as I had ordered!  Thanks to Mama for
snacks she brought back today from her trip.</p>

<p>Mika had to head back to work so Kai and I walked her there and then
walked to Tokyo station by way of her English speaking dentist.  We
met a man in the station who is apparently an 江戸子(sp), and talked
about how his ggggrandfather was a samurai.</p>

<p><a href="//b.robnugen.com/journal/2017/funny_guy.jpg"><img src="//b.robnugen.com/journal/2017/thumbs/funny_guy.jpg" alt="funny guy" /></a></p>

<p>Kai and I took the second oldest subway in Tokyo to the busiest train
station in Japan (the world?) and I jumped into a picture with some
guys who were posing next to a sign featuring Snoopy and large text
&ldquo;Pose here&rdquo; or something.  Then the timing worked out that Lin arrived
just after me so we took the same train back to our station!</p>

<p>I walked for 2 hours from NB lesson to Yoyogi Park.  I had 2 hours
total and Google said it would take 1 hour and 45 minutes.  I stopped
once to get a snack and a drink (and to change from pants to shorts)
and then stopped again to buy a 2 liter bottle of tea.  Made it to
Yoyogi Park with 2 minutes to spare.</p>

<p>Great time at the party; talked to a lot of people and met Chris&rsquo;
friend Becca.  Afteward, Chris and Becca invited Lin and me to karaoke
with them.  Super great fun!  Chris <em>loves</em> karaoke.  He said his
record is 14 hours in one session, and then 6 hours the next day!</p>

<p>Physics Girl reminded me of the fun that can be had with magnets.</p>

<p>Today before my (ostensibly English) lesson with GG, I bought a meter
of thin, shielded copper wire, a couple magnets, and a little light
(emitting diode).</p>

<p>I brought with me a 1.5 volt AA battery and a ferrous, though
magnetically neutral <del>Allen wrench</del> <ins>hex driver</ins>
which will act as my electro magnet.</p>

<p>I asked M if she can bring scissors, because the wire needs to be cut
and stripped on the ends.</p>

<p>I hope it all works!  At the very least, we should be able to light
the light by moving the magnets down the wire.</p>

<p>However, I&rsquo;m not sure if the battery will be strong (charged) enough
to make a fun electromagnet.</p>

<h2 id="afterward">afterward</h2>

<p>Yup, I got schooled.  The electromagnet worked, but the
magnet-along-wire did <em>not</em> work!  GG still enjoyed the lesson, but
it&rsquo;s back to books next week, with 2 new students joining the class!</p>

<p>Satomi said her friend Kenji liked to climb trees so we should all do
so!  Today was the day; we met in Yoyogi Park at 4pm.  At first it was
Satomi and Zakky, and then I showed up and we went into Yoyogi.  Kenji
and his wife Sherry (sp) came as well, and their friend Ozan lives
nearby so joined the fun. He said he wasn&rsquo;t good at climbing trees,
but we had fun playing badmitton and throwing a hard tennis ball at
velcro mitts.</p>

<p>After trees were climbed, we sat next to the pond, and after that,
Satomi and Zakky had to split so the rest of us went to an Italian
eatery near Ozan and Sachiko&rsquo;s place.  Sachiko joined during dinner
and showed us pics of the stuffed rabbit she&rsquo;s making for a project!
I introduced Francois and got a pic of him with Kenji and Sherry
(along with her squirrel-skin iphone cover).  Nice!</p>

<p>Just finished eating sakura ice cream with Scean, Kasagawa, and
another guy whose name I didn&rsquo;t get.  We talked a lot (though I didn&rsquo;t
ask for permission to transcribe his interesting stories)!</p>

<p>This was all after about 6 hours of group lessons, all coordinated
from the front of the room; basically the lesson content wasn&rsquo;t
difficult but all the coordination took a bit of focus.  I didn&rsquo;t
think to bring water, so by the end I was a little parched and had a
bit of a headache, but bare feet in the rain took care of that quite
quickly!</p>

<p>We all chowed at a restaurant, and it was a quite nice experience
overall.  I kinda wanted to stay, but I really want to improve my
Japanese so I&rsquo;m going to class now.</p>
