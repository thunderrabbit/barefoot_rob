                        <p>Hide and Akiko from 7pm class each needed to make up some lessons, so
stayed for the 8pm class featuring Misato and Tatsuya.</p>

<p>I think it worked pretty well; they had not met each other, and they
are all pretty much similar personalities so I figured they would get
along fine.</p>

<p>After self intros, most of the time they talked about Akiko&rsquo;s challenging business trip
to Hydrabad, India.  Most of the rest of the time we talked about Hide&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p>I put a question mark on the title because I cannot really prove the
visions are related to past lives, but this is a fun way to guide
people through a process to see what could be their past lives.</p>

<pre><code>Each participant gets into a relaxed position, usually either
sitting in a chair, or laying down, or otherwise sitting against
something comfortable.

Spend a few minutes leading the participants through a relaxation
process, whereby they let their bodies relax and keep their minds
awake.  Once they are in this mind awake / body asleep mode,
invite them to imagine getting up and leaving the room.  Guide
them to imagine traveling far away, whether by vehicle, or through
a cave, or through a forest, or by any other means which takes
them from the familiar, to the unfamiliar, and guide them to
arrive somewhere new, yet familiar.

Give the participants a chance to explore the familiar area,
including seeing other inhabitants of the area and moving around
and communicating with them.

Once they have explored the area, lead the participants gently
back the way they came, allowing them to have a clear memory of
what happened and what they heard and saw. (say things like
&quot;coming back slowly, you clearly remember what you experienced,&quot;
etc) Once their awareness focuses back on their physical bodies,
give them a chance to write down what they experienced.  Do not
speak until everyone is pretty much done writing.

The whole process is a state of light hypnosis, and everyone will
still have full control and awareness of where their physical body
is.  They will be able to come back in a moment's notice if they
choose.

Each process will take about 20 or 30 minutes.

<p>Several different things on my day off today.  Mostly related to work,
where I realized the value of having a staging server with non-live
data.  &ldquo;Ohhh that is right; I tested saving data as well..&rdquo; when AB
was like, &ldquo;Um, where is the Azabujuban record?&rdquo; which had been renamed
to &ldquo;Doraemon 5e5433a38e2b035689a75c9ed11ffb0e&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once I fixed all of those (about 8 different records) based on the old
live DB which is still available at cli with <code>mysql</code> as root, I
watched episode 3 of The Naked Director.</p>

<p>This show is somewhat a comedy, but fills in my imagination of the
heady days before the bubble burst here in Japan.  I sometimes wonder
what it could have been like then, and this gives me a sense that I
would not have necessarily been better off for being here then.
Interesting to watch, though, and practice listening to Japanese.</p>

<p>I tried to do some more work, but was leaning toward porn after having
watched a shows which leans toward porn, so I took a nap.</p>

<p>Woke up and wrote down <a href="/journal/2019/08/30/dream-unstoppable-trains/">a dream about unstoppable trains</a>.</p>

<p><a href="//b.robnugen.com/journal/2019/dreams/20190830_165150_Dream_0000000249.jpg"><img src="//b.robnugen.com/journal/2019/dreams/thumbs/20190830_165150_Dream_0000000249.jpg" alt="20190830 165150 Dream 0000000249" /></a></p>

<p>And as I write this, I see the messy image and realize if I ever clean
up those images, I hope I either create redirects or think to fix the
links here.</p>

<p>Mohamed asked the URL for my journal, which is nice timing because
today is the first day for me to use ROBOT pages from August 29th,
which include writing a journal entry by default.  Again, this
directory and file structure leaves a lot to be
desired. <a href="https://b.robnugen.com/robot/2019/">https://b.robnugen.com/robot/2019/</a></p>

<p>I want to have OCR determine the dates of the pages and rename the
files based on those dates.  I have considered posting each page in
this journal stream, but I think it would be better to make an RSS
feed of them (but it would not get updated with each scan (if it was
tied only into this repo of entries)).  It should be a different RSS
feed, built just for b.robnugen.com</p>

                        <p class="note">(actually written 14:12 Wednesday 24 July 2019 JST)</p>

<p>After getting a photo with Kanauknot, we headed toward the roller
coaster, but were sidetracked by a tiny house that offered free
entry.</p>

<p>(It was inside the house that I took off my shoes; they felt so
uncomfortably hot!)</p>

<p>Lin and Mikarin were like かわいいいいい at everything as I looked to
see where I could explore.  I considered using the upright piano to
access the loft, but decided not to.</p>

<p>We skipped the coaster because it&rsquo;s actually super slow, powered not
by gravity, but by motorized car tires in the front and rear cars.</p>

<p>Went to ここドコ (or maybe ココドコ) which is a 3D maze with 12 goals
where we can get stamps to find the location of the 13th stamp,
somewhere in the park.  Mikarin and I found 9 stamps of the 12 before
we accidentally ended up outside the maze area and in the exit steps.
The door locked and the structure surrounding the door did not seem
strong enough to let me climb back over to let us back in.  Fair
enough, and we headed out for more adventures.</p>

<p>Lots of mazey climby type things that would be great to play follow
the leader.  Mikarin did a pretty good job of keeping up with me.</p>

<p>Through one maze, there were too many spider webs so even I was like
&ldquo;bah; let&rsquo;s go back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From inside the fenced area, we took a picture of Lin sleeping.  (I
gotta getta license so I can help her drive.)</p>

<p>Then climbed on more stuff than I can enumerate here in a way that
will even partly make sense.  (I gotta charge my camera more
diligently.)</p>

<p>We did the Ferris Wheel after finding the ropes course type thing
called ワイヤーsomething was closed for repairs.  Apparently guests
must wear shoes in there because I saw signs for shoe rental nearby.</p>

<p>We ate lunch and then were kinda headed out of the park before I saw
the unicycle guy near some kinda balance beam type straps.  He said
they were not slackline so we could not bounce on them, but I do not
know what else to call them.</p>

<p>I balanced my way around the four short segments and then he was like
&ldquo;but can you do it backwards?&rdquo; so I walked a bit backwards.  I tried a
couple different things and I appreciated that he did not try to stop
me (though he did point out some dangers (e.g. the angled strap would
be slippery)).</p>

<p>We balanced on a large plastic ball and jumped around on it.</p>

<p>Basically I was in heaven, climbing and balancing on things.</p>

<p>At some point, he told me they had a show scheduled for 1pm.  Sounds
good, so I went to it.</p>

<p>OMG so glad I did!!</p>

<p>Max and I met at The Pink Cow where Lin and I were going to meet,
but she ended up heading home instead after work.  After filling up on
world famous bean burritos at The Pink Cow, we walked to Roppongi
Midtown where we spent a considerable amount of time wondering how to
measure if the circular glass window over the white
not-really-egg-shaped stone is round or not.  I ultimately decided it
was not round because the wires inside the glass (which travel at 45
degree angles to the edge) did not bisect the quadrangle shapes,
making them rectangle, not square.</p>

<p>With the tools we had available, I could not think of a way.  The
best I could think of would be to take a string on opposite sides of
the shape and walk around the circumfrence.</p>

<p>Max decided to try barefooting with me so he took off his shoes
and we headed down the escalator and to the white stone to get the
only pictures of the night.</p>

<p>Headed to Roppongi Hills and wandered around on different surfaces
from astroturf to vents blowing air up through the floor.</p>

<p>Went back to Roppongi Crossing and down the bar-crawl street to chat
with the Nigerian guys who invite us into the bar.  Tonight I claimed
I could not afford shoes, and one guy said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s nice to see some
poor people around here,&rdquo; which Max and I decided was a really
funny thing to say/hear.</p>

<p>We ended up going up into a bar for a moment because the guy said it
was free, but bounced after talking to them a bit upstairs.  It&rsquo;s free
<em>if</em> we buy a drink.  Max was like &ldquo;let&rsquo;s bounce&rdquo; so we headed out and
he goes &ldquo;that was scary,&rdquo; citing that they would &ldquo;probably&rdquo; spike our
drinks, etc.  Yeah, it could happen, and would definitely not be my
intended way to enjoy an evening!  I wonder how to protect against
that except pour my own drink or see the bottle be opened.</p>

<p>The next guy said we can go to a real topless bar, but we did not head
up there (it was definitely not free), but I asked if I could come
back with Lin.  He was like &ldquo;yeah sure&rdquo; so I guess it would be okay.
Doubt she would go for it, but could be fun.</p>

<p>Headed home via Nogizaka station where I gave Max a hug and see ya
sometime.</p>

<p>Fun in the sun today at SOGO Bootcamp.  We had to adjust our normal
workout area due to puddles, but all good and lots of fun.  I remet
Anuj, Valeria, Lisa, Alex, Ben.  Got to see Haruo and Jim again as
they led ultimate frisbee after bootcamp.</p>

<p>We played until about 1:18pm with about 6 on 6 down to 4 on 4 as
people had to go.</p>

<p>My friend wanted to buy a ticket to leave on Saturday and accidentally
bought a ticket that leaves at 00:01am (one minute after midnight)
Saturday morning. (26 hours from now as I write this)</p>

<p>I challenged him to write 25 benefits of such a situation.  Here are
mine:</p>

<ol>
<li>have a funny story</li>
<li>be awake with nothing to do but watch digital clock turn from 23:59:59 to 00:00:00</li>
<li>arrive at airport when it&rsquo;s relatively quiet</li>
<li>get a chance to see behind-the-scenes stuff they only do at night at airports</li>
<li>not have to wake up early for a flight</li>
<li>have already halfway solved the jetlag issue</li>
<li>get to really ponder the human construct of tracking time</li>
<li>have a chance to put a smile on face of staff working late</li>
<li>save time shopping for souvenirs</li>
<li>save money on buying souvenirs</li>
<li>have moving walkway all to yourself</li>
<li>get to wonder if other passengers made the same mistake</li>
<li>get to joke about how early the flight is</li>
<li>easy chance to sleep late on Saturday</li>
<li>no worries about a large choice of food vendors in airport</li>
<li>immediate night mode on plane so can sleep quickly</li>
<li>&ldquo;I leave tonight&rdquo; and &ldquo;I leave tomorrow&rdquo; are both true</li>
<li>passport stamps says you left the day before you actually leave</li>
<li>opportunity for taking nighttime photos at airport</li>
<li>can play in kids zone because no kids will be there</li>
<li>can say &ldquo;good evening&rdquo; to one seatmate immediately before &ldquo;good morning&rdquo; to next seatmate.</li>
<li>easily compare flight duration with length of day</li>
<li>get to board a plane wearing pajamas</li>
<li>get wonder when and wear the pilots slept</li>
<li>can say &ldquo;I remember getting on the plane like it was yesterday&rdquo;</li>
</ol>

<p>This morning I walked during the typhoon that passed by Tokyo today.
I saw some interesting effects of water rushing down the hill near
よみうりランド前駅 I captured them on vertical video on Marco Polo to
send to Lin, who stayed home.</p>

<p>Great fun at SOGO today and not too hot, but a bit tiring.  It&rsquo;s
apparently Alisha&rsquo;s last day.  Chatted with Thanuja at the Mexican
restaurant for lunch; 12 SOGO peeps at our table.  Leo and Lydia
reminded me about geocaching.</p>
