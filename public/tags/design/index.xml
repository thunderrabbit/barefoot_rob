      <description>22:28 Friday 11 January 2019 JST I wrote a post on Hugo forums to find a site designer who can make a nice design for Marble Track 3. As of this writing, the website uses my tweak of Castanet, and looks like this Marble Track 3 site v2 (via archive.org)
Because the project takes some time to explain, I want the website to quickly give people an overview, and allow people to click in to get more details if they like.</description>

      <description>21:14 Sunday 30 December 2018 JST Dear Rob, Glad to see you email. I have gone through the website and there are a lot of improvement which can be done. Please check one of our Hugo based website - https://www.nathanaherne.com – If you’ll see on Home page – we have shown important section of the site briefly and with pictures. Same I’ll propose for this website i.e. we can show 3 or 6 Workers with Images, 3-6 Tracks, One Step with picture.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m not really going mad, but I realize the code I am trying to write for the MD5 count thing is like a madlib. I want to take a string and replace tokens with example words.
Only difference: I want to do a combination of all the options. Essentially
foreach adjective in my list of adjectives: for each noun in my list of nouns: fill in the adjective and noun in template  So I end up with length-adjectives * length-nouns sentences, each of which I will md5 and see if it can work for the next MD5 count.</description>
