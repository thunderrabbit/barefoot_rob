<p>I wrote a post on Hugo forums to find a site designer who can make a
nice design for Marble Track 3.  As of this writing, the website uses
my tweak of Castanet, and looks like this
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190111132634/https://www.marbletrack3.com/">Marble Track 3 site v2 (via archive.org)</a></p>

<p>Because the project takes some time to explain, I want the website to
quickly give people an overview, and allow people to click in to get
more details if they like.</p>

<p>One designer replied to my Hugo post.  We had a chat and this is their
first design iteration.
<a href="https://www.deligence.com/clients/marbletrack3/">https://www.deligence.com/clients/marbletrack3/</a>   I made a rough copy
here <a href="https://vigilant-mayer-608cf8.netlify.com/">https://vigilant-mayer-608cf8.netlify.com/</a></p>

<p>One thing Jimmy noted was they used a hexagon motif where circles
would be more appropriate.  I spent a couple hours trying to reverse
engineer SVG paths</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://svghelper.com/">https://svghelper.com/</a> for helping me create this shape</p>

<p>I sent this response</p>

<pre><code>HI Sanjay

Thank you for the design.

I really like the video embedded in the header graphic, but it seems too dark to me; can it be made somewhat lighter color?

I like that the site is responsive.

Easy changes:

1a) The VIDEO section should be directly below &quot;These guys are great!
Just look at them go!&quot;.  So please swap the order of OUR WORKERS to be
below VIDEO

1b) remove rectangle from around VIDEO section so it will seem
connected to above text &quot;Look at them go!&quot;

2a) In the TRACK (PARTS) section, the Made by sections should not have
a space before the colon (&quot;Made by: &quot; is correct)

2b) In the TRACK (PARTS) section, there should be no space before
commas after workers names (&quot;Dr Sugar, Mr McGlue, Squarehead&quot; is
correct)

3) My friend made a rough logo that can replace the four circles logo.
He will simplify it so it works at a small size

<pre><code>Harder changes

4) Please add a placeholder for the language selection.  There should
be two languages for now: English and Japanese

5) The hexagon theme doesn't make sense with the marbles; can the
theme be round instead of hexagons?  Here are some examples of
unnecessary hexagons, but there are many
more. https://www.deligence.com/clients/marbletrack3/images/hexline_2.png

&lt;/svg&gt;

6) Anchors in the top right for Twitter, Youtube, Github are too wide.
The anchors overlap so that when mouse cursor is over Twitter anchor,
the Youtube anchor is active.

<pre><code>7) FYI: The current site has no Javascript, so the new site should
still work without javascript.  (no fancy graphics need without
Javascript, but the site should work Web 1.0 if javascript is off)

8) There are many errors in browser console.  Please remove or repair the broken code

XML Parsing Error: not well-formed Location: https://www.deligence.com/clients/marbletrack3/index.html# Line Number 21, Column 70: index.html:21:70

9) How do you plan to receive feedback from users?  This site will be
hosted on Netlify.

10) OUR WORKERS section should be dynamically generated so as I add
more workers, they will show up on the top page in OUR WORKERS
section.

Rob

<pre><code>Dear Rob,


Glad to see you email. I have gone through the website and there
are a lot of improvement which can be done. Please check one of
our Hugo based website - https://www.nathanaherne.com – If you’ll
see on Home page – we have shown important section of the site
briefly and with pictures. Same I’ll propose for this website
i.e. we can show 3 or 6 Workers with Images, 3-6 Tracks, One Step
with picture.


Also, the concept of the site is totally different and unique – we
need to put few lines to let the visitors understand what the site
is all about. We need to create a good logo as well. Regarding
Support/Donations, we need to create multiple ‘Call to Action’s to
take the visitors to the support page.


Do let me know your thoughts on my initial comments and do let me
know if you are available for a video call on 3rd or 4th Jan? My
Skype id is sanjay.deligence



Thanks &amp; Regards,

Sanjay Kumar | CEO

Deligence Technologies - your growing technology partner

<p>My replies, (poorly formatted here on my site):</p>

<pre><code>HI Sanjay

Thank you for your email.  I am glad you looked at the same
carefully enough to know it is a completely unique project.  I
agree with the changes you have suggested so far.

Here are some more sections of the site I would like to be considered:

Episodes
There is one more set of pages you should see as well.  https://www.marbletrack3.com/episode/   This page is hidden from normal visitors.  I would like the design of this page to match the rest of the site, but I do not want the page to be linked from the menus.

Episodes are driven with the file at
https://github.com/marbletracks/marbletrack3.com/blob/master/data/playlists/knownvideos.toml
This file is updated with calls to Youtube API, driven by this
script https://github.com/marbletracks/go-get-video-durations

I am very happy with the way this all works.  I only want to
redesign the /episodes page to match the rest of the site.

Parts / Workers Did you see how these pages are linked between
Workers and Tracks?  For example,
https://www.marbletrack3.com/parts/caret_splitter_feeder_extension/
source code includes an array of Workers that worked on the track.
There will be many many more tracks to come, and I eventually need
a way to allow human fans/supporters of the project to suggest
names of parts.

Thanks There will eventually be many more pages available under
https://www.marbletrack3.com/thanks/ There are no pictures of
people here yet, but this section is to thank the people who have
helped me with the track.  The Sweets Party Attendants have helped
me with translations.  Two more people have helped financially,
but I do not have images / permission to show them on the site.  I
would like a page under /thanks/ to be for this general support.

Steps Under &quot;Step by Step&quot; https://www.marbletrack3.com/snippets/
my idea is not nearly finished.  If you click the first Step you
see this page,
https://www.marbletrack3.com/snippets/0010_setting_the_stage/ The
Step is a detailed description of the first video snippet in this
playlist
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KjsYc4Mb5g&amp;list=PL0osPGt21FB48UwuhtCUoi9JndC9YDHAZ

In order to drive this part of the site, I want to create a data
file similar to

I have sketched out a file at
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://github.com/marbletracks/marbletrack3.com/blob/master/static/track_listing.txt">https://github.com/marbletracks/marbletrack3.com/blob/master/static/track_listing.txt</a></p>

<pre><code>but I have not written a way to parse it nor easily populate it.
There is no way to automatically create this data file, so I need to
have a reliable way to manually add new sections to it.

I would like for each written Step to be linked to the
corresponding second of output video.

This line

0:32 &quot;candy_mama&quot; | Snake Plate Chopstick for now, will create
text on the site for Snake Plate Chopstick and link it to second
32 of the correct video https://youtu.be/2bP7Irt5hHc?t=32

I imagine this is a mini-project of its own, so I do not mind if
we do not work on it.  But I am open to questions, ideas, and
suggestions for it.

In General For this project

I would like all work to be done in the open with Pull Requests on
Github.  I want all changes to work with my current workflow: when
I git push changes to the site, they appear on the live site via
Netlify.  I understand you do not have access to my Netlify
account.  But I hope once I merge a pull request, it will work
that way.  We can start with small changes to make sure it works
in a way that is good for both of us.

blessings
- Rob

<p>A few minutes later</p>

<pre><code>HI Sanjay

I have just realized I sent my email before speaking about
https://www.nathanaherne.com/

You said &quot;we have shown important section of the site briefly and with
pictures.&quot;  Instead of pictures, I want to use video clips like the
ones I have at the bottom of my existing
site. https://b.robnugen.com/art/marble_track_3/workers/snippets/quick_look_francois_installs_stage.mp4

The overall idea on Nathan's site is good, but Marble Track 3 site
must focus on the workers and not focus on me as doing the work.  I
will be semi-hidden from the project, only visible on /episodes and
git repository.


thank you
Rob

<p>I&rsquo;m not really going mad, but I realize the code I am trying to write
for the MD5 count thing is like a madlib.  I want to take a string and
replace tokens with example words.</p>

<p>Only difference: I want to do a combination of <em>all</em> the options.
Essentially</p>

<pre><code>foreach adjective in my list of adjectives:
    for each noun in my list of nouns:
        fill in the adjective and noun in template
</code></pre>

<p>So I end up with length-adjectives * length-nouns sentences, each of
which I will md5 and see if it can work for the next MD5 count.</p>

<p>I was thinking of using <code>map</code> to map my template from the list of
adjectives, but then essentially I have a shitton of memory being
used.  I don&rsquo;t need to keep <em>any</em> of the strings in memory; just check
each one and poop it out if it&rsquo;s good.</p>

<p>So far, I&rsquo;m able to split the input string into an array on the tokens
and keep the tokens cause I need to fill them in later:</p>

<pre><code>my %files = (
    'ADJECTIVE' =&gt; 'adjectives.txt',
    'NOUN'  =&gt; 'nouns.txt',
    'VERB'  =&gt; 'verbs.txt'
);

my @replaceable_tokens = keys %files;

# Will be 'ADJECTIVE|NOUN|VERB' for use in split regex
my $replaceable_tokens_ORed = join('|',@replaceable_tokens);        

# grab two unnamed command line parameters
my ($string, $target) = @ARGV;      

# tokenize the input string while keeping tokens
my @tokenized_string = split(/($replaceable_tokens_ORed)/, $string);
</code></pre>

<p>Next I will make a variable for each of the tokens which will act as a
counter for the corresponding list of words.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t yet have a smart way to loop through a variable number of
loops, though I think that will have to come next.</p>
