      <description>05:23 Thursday 23 July 2015 JST Yesterday Chris and I were both a bit later than normal leaving our lesson so we missed the train that we usually take. The next train comes 5 minutes later, but due to his train connections, Chris arrives home 21 minutes later if he takes it.
I was like, &amp;ldquo;I ain&amp;rsquo;t gonna run, but feel free to if you like. OR, we can chill at the (next) station!</description>
