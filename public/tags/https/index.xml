      <description>15:43 Monday 19 March 2018 JST Nice to see setting up SSL certificates for Apache 2 on Ubuntu is pretty easy. They even automagically set up a cron job to renew the certificate after two months. See /etc/cron.d/certbot
I had a problem for a minute because one .conf file had a domain and an alias in it. I ran certbot for the aliased domain and told it to go ahead and force https, but then that broke the main domain (which was the main domain) by forcing SSL and using the certificates for the test domain.</description>

      <description>09:16 Monday 05 October 2015 JST Going through a toot to create a tvOS app and need to download some json over HTTPS, or create an exception in the app. I set up HTTPS with startssl clunky wizardry and presto:
https://apps.chatforest.com/tvos/api/1/sample.json
The data is taken from
https://www.themoviedb.org/
Which says I can just use https, but my tvos app gets a certificate warning.</description>
