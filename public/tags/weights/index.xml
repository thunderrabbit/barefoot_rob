      <description>18:50 Saturday 16 September 2017 JST Simon gave me a set of weights, including one which he found discarded on a hiking trail. We hiked up the trail, found the weight still there, collected it and cleaned it up in his shower.
He wanted to give me dumbells, but after I asked what would be good for my lower back, he suggested a T-bar kettlebell.

At one point we got a pic at the supermarket while he bought us beef for steak and potatoes.</description>
