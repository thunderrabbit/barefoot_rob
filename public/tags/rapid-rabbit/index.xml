I&amp;rsquo;m sure Rapid Rabbit is probably taken as a company name and website, but I just thought of something to call my new(!) consulting service. Basically, Soness was like, &amp;ldquo;can you help me organize my stuff?&amp;rdquo; and I was like, &amp;ldquo;maybe!&amp;rdquo; and she was like, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll pay you!&amp;rdquo; and I go &amp;ldquo;hmmmmmmmm!&amp;rdquo; So I went over to her place today and scanned a bunch of business cards which I import into some kind of CSR software (probably monkey mail for now); I&amp;rsquo;m going to go through a bunch of receipts for her and I&amp;rsquo;ll mail some papers to her accountant.</description>
