<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>In an area with a shallow pool and I was surprised to
see some cats sitting patiently at the bottom of the pool.  I surmised
it must be an optical illusion of some sort, but I got into the pool
and it was no trick; there really were cats in there.  I tried to
avoid them as they seemed not too keen on having visitors, but one of
them clawed me in the back of my right hand.  I was able to get my
hand away and then get out of the pool.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>Went to a nice restaurant with Wende, and then to the
restroom to wash my hands, and Robin and Chris from my I-group were
there each taking a piss.  I was at the sink and could hear their
voices, and then when they came out I was like, "HI" and told them I'd
be out in a second.</p>

<p class=dream>Robin came back in and said he had to go somewhere real
quick, and then I was out in the restaurant and one of the waitresses
asked me if I worked there.  I was all, "no" and she was all, "darn,"
because there weren't enough cute guys on the waitstaff near her age.
Hmmm; very interesting.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class=dream>At a school, a college campus, and attended a religious
meeting of some sort, and I chose to go to the freshman area, even
though I was a junior, for this was my first year in the school to
attend this meeting.  The students in different sections were sitting
in perfect rectangular shapes, instead of in circles.  There had been
no indication of how to arrange ourselves; it just seemed to happen
that way.</p>

<p class=dream>The girl to my left was a veteran of thsis group; she
was sitting patiently, and looked like Jack's friend Natalie.  The
girl to my right was a first timer like myself, and she looked like
maybe Mimi from Youth Council and Steering Committee some years
ago.</p>

<p class=dream>The church leader guy came out and told us what pages
to read of their holy book, and we were expected to repeat four times
what he said.  Most of the group cooperated, but a few people (like
me) wouldn't say anything, and a few (like Mimi) complained they
wouldn't do it at all for they were being treated like children.
Natalie was all, "give it a chance" or something.</p>

<p class=dream>The guy in the center threw a piece of ice at Mimi, but
missed her by a mile (several feet).  He said something like, "oh I
can't throw very well" but then proceeded to throw a piece of ice at
the ice machine and exactly hit its power button and turn it on.  Then
he threw another piece and exactly turned it off.  The piece used to
turn the machine off bounced toward me, so I picked it up and took a
bite of ice.</p>

<p class=dream>Natalie and I were both sitting, leaning back on our
hands and our fingers touched.  We flirted a bit, but then I was all,
"I can't right now," and disengaged my hand from hers.  She said
something about her innocence that was more like saying how she was
flirting without breaking any rules.  Hmm.  So I let her hand touch
mine again.</p>

<p class=dream>The leader guy came back into the circle, but this time
in a huge cadillac twice as wide and twice as long as a normal car,
but still normal height, and it was a hardtop convertible with the top off.
Many people were in the car and everyone started getting out and I
flew away from the crowd because I felt threatened by something.  I
was flying at super high speed through trees like in Star Wars in
Empire or Jedi (I forget) on the planet Endor.</p>

<p class=dream>The bad guys were unable to chase me so quickly through
the trees, and I was just flying so fast, often times twirling and not
looking where I was going, but still going crazy fast without hitting
anything.</p>

<p class=dream>I was able to fly low near the ground and up a slight
incline (unusual for me), and able to fly way way high within the
branches of trees.  Huge pine trees and redwoods.</p>

<p class=dream>I found in a deep canyon in the forest, some sort of
fort the bad guys had built, and I had a sheet of paper in my pocket
that depicted a map of the fort area, and I had to rotate it a few
times to get it to line up correctly, but mostly I just realized I was
having a dream and that I would make it line up corectly, even if the
origianl map didn't have to do with this fort below me.</p>

<p class=dream>I looked for a weakness and figured out that I needed
to knock down a log on one corner of the fort and that would set off a
chain reaction to destroy it, but I knew I possibly wouldn't be able
to get fly back up again after flying that far down (sometimes I have
trouble flying up in my dreams if I'm stopped, especially if I'm down
low) so I flew back out of the forest where bad guys and good guys
were fighting in cars on the road and I found a friend and tried to
figure out a way to get her the note without me stopping flying, and
without chance of the bad guys getting it.</p>

<p>Then the phone rang and I woke up.</p>

<p class=dream>Out by a curb meeting two kids on the street.  One of
them was all, "Joe," or something and I asked the other for his name
and he  took a breath and said, "Chapsanova."</p>

<p class=dream>"Spell it," I said, then "oh wait.  I got it."</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>Peering over the edge of some rough clay bluff (about
20 feet tall) I witnessed the process of life as ants were attacking a
velvet ant.  I climbed down for a closer look and saw more ants
chewing on a butterfly or something.  I really really wanted to help
the butterfly by picking it up, but I just sent it positive thoughts
with my mind and encouraged it to have the strength to fly free.</p>

<p class=dream>It flew up out of the ants reach and then there was another
different color butterfly in the same predicament who also flew free
after a bit.</p>

<p class=dream>They had gotten away from the ants but were now in a dank cellar
that didn't seem to be the best place for butterflies to be.  The
second one was closest to me, so I put my finger out that it my climb
onto and it (the butterfly) clawed me with one of its claws and I was
like yeow and pulled away from it and left it to fend for itself.</p>

<p class=dream>The other butterfly was on the floor and had used its
wings to cover itself up like in a box.  I saw that its skin had the
slightest gold tinge over it like a sheen of gold paint, or like the
chrysalis of some types of butterflies.  Its box opened up and the
butterfly woke up as if from a deep slumber and it looked like a small
human figure, like a muppet butterfly might look with little fuzzy
face and two arms and two legs and little boots except one of its legs
had broken off at the hip and I was like, "oh god" cause I had roused
this butterfly from its final slumber, it knew it was time to die and
had built its little coffin, and when I woke it up, the butterfly
tried to put its leg back on like a pulling on some tall boots and it
was just so tragic I cried cried cried in my dream until I woke
up.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>In a hotel type thing, and Will Robidee, the general
manager of KTRU was in charge of taking care of stuff.  I took an
elevator up, and couldn't find the button to go up, so I flipped a
little switch and it went up beyond the level of the roof.  I was
really scared that I might fall, but it didn't and I was able to get
it back down to the level of the roof.  I told Will what happened, and
he showed me how to fix it.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class=dream>I was back at work, or I had to bring something back to
work and the door was unlocked though I used a key to get in, like I
still had a key, and it appeared to work, but it only worked since the
door was already unlocked.</p>

<p class=dream>Got inside and remembered that I didn't work there
anymore.  Dave and Dennis came to see who was intruding, and were all,
"oh, it's Rob" and went about their business for a second before
coming to say HI.</p>

<p class=dream>I felt really sad during the dream.  Everyone was
dressed nicely and having fun, and there were some cute cute girls
that I had worked with at Telecheck there.  Some YRUUers were there as
well.  I wasn't willing to express my sadness there so I gave them the
peace out sign and left.</p>

<p class=dream>I wanted to get out as quickly as possible, but I took
the elevator too far down and had to climb up a flight of stairs to
get to the parking lot level.  I was opening crying and when I got
near my car I was going to kick a kickball in a venting anger type
way, but I chose not to at the last second and it just sorta bounced
away.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>I was meditatively removing was from a jar while
talking to Jennifer at Paint This!, but I was not really getting any
productive work done toward etting my butt out of Houston.</p>

<p class=dream>She was making plans for us to paint on Saturday, but I
was all, "I won't be here..."  It was disconcerting for a friend to
forget that little detail.</p>

<p class=dream>I hadn't made any plans for where to stay in Dallas,
nor did I have any money to stay anywhere.</p>

<p class=dream>I was living back in our house that I lived in from 3rd
to 7th gread.  I had packed all my laundry and my mom took it
somewhere and I couldn't find it.  I scoured through the house
multiple times, but it was not there.  My mom thought maybe she had
accidentally taken it out as garbage.</p>

<p class=dream>So I went outside and walked down the street a bit to a
neighbor's house and saw bags of trash.  I went up toward their house
and discovered that they were throwing away a huge amount of clothes.
Some T-shirts and some button up shirts.</p>

<p class=dream>The apparent owner of the clothes was behind a wall
with a window on it.  I got his attention (the window was tinted or
stained glass or something) and he was DJing on some turntables.  I
talked to him a bit and he said I could have some of the button up
shirts.</p>

<p class=dream>Then we were walking or riding a bus and it turns out
that I had heard of him; his DJ name was Mussimaxx or something.  He
was pleased and impressed hat I had heard of him.</p>

<p class=dream>Then I was walking along a highway and noticed a
balloon being wafted along each time a car drove by.  I could see
clearly the turbulence caused by each car.  The sun shone brightly and
it was hot.  I stayed in the shade as much as possible, though there
wasn't much shade to be found.</p>

<p class=dream>Came to an old abandoned watering hole, with a small
amount of mucky water in the bottom.  I wasn't thirsty enough to drink
any of it, but I wondered if I ever would be.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>In a classroom situation, a student was outside with
the intention of knocking down the flag pole in such a way that it
would crash into the classroom.</p>

<p class=dream>The professor didn't seem too worried, saying
something like "I wonder what it will be <em>this</em> time?"</p>

<p class=dream>I was all <em>he's going to crash into the school; look
out</em></p>

<p class=dream>But when I saw the plan unfold outside, it was less
than menacing.</p>

<p class=dream>He was down the hill a ways riding on a park-sized
train (that people can ride for fun around a park) and had tied a
cable from the train to the flag pole.  But he had tied the cable in a
direct line to the flagpole, so that when the train moved forward, the
cable would be routed around a tree, severely limiting the destructive
force of the train.</p>

<pre>
    train
====#####==================  train track
     \
      \
       \
        \     # tree
         \
          \
           \
            \. flagpole
---------------------------   edge of school
</pre>

<p class=dream>The train rolled along the track and the student
noticed the cable was now bent around the tree, so he cut the cable
and went to run up around the tree and back to the train, but then the
somehow ran over the cable so he couldn't attach it...  such a mess
was made of his plan.</p>

<p class=dream>It turns out the cable was a high density fiber optic
data cable, so the student was in a ton of trouble for cutting it and
letting a train run over it.  I was put in the position of yelling at
the student, but noisy people were all around me being noisy and the
student was a 6 or so year old girl who was quite uncomforable with
the whole situation.  I was glad to wake up.</p>

<p>Woke up early and considered getting up to fold my laundry (rally shirts
on the bed), but rolled over onto them and fell back asleep.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>With YRUU peeps - Bryn, Mark V-S and others.  I had something
to give to Mark, but I couldn't remember where I had put it.  I looked in a
trash can next to where we were standing, but it had gross food wrappers in
it so I didn't look too deeply.</p>

<p class=dream>I was somehow skating with YRUU youth in my backpack like I
was piggy backing them.  I skated to some little shops selling various
random things.</p>

<p class=dream>Got a phone call from Ryan, who was looking for a ride to the
next rally.  I was all, "Ryan, you are 20 years old; you may not go."</p>

<p class=dream>He feigned surprise, "what?  What are you talking about?"
even though I know full well how old he is and that he knows the age limit
rule.</p>

<p class=dream>I became a bit angry with him, "Ryan!  You may not go, and
you know that."</p>

<p class=dream>Then we were in a room full of old junk and it was apparently
a shop, but the proprietor wasn't there.  We closed the door a bit, but left
the light on as we left.  I looked for my skates, but didn't find them at
first. </p>

<p class=dream>Found my skates, but considered just walking the remaining
black to go home.  I was sitting on the steps when three or four guys came
running up the steps from between the houses across the street.  They were
looking for someone who had stolen something.</p>

<p class=dream>At first I thought they were chasing each other, but then I
saw a guy climbing up a tree to hide.   They saw him too, and pulled his ass
out of the tree and had him on the ground and started to beat him up.</p>

<p class=dream>I was flat scared, but snuck my way back up the stairs as I
dialed 911.  The operator came on and she was all somewhat talkative and
thought I was kidding at first.  I told her I was afraid that would come
ofter me because they saw that I had a phone and was dialing.</p>

<p class=dream>The 911 operator was standing in the room with me as we hung
up, and she was still talkative and I was scared as pooh.  Then suddenly I
heard some <em>thump thump thump</em> up the stairs and I freaked a bit,
"seee?"</p>

<p class=dream>But it was the owner of the house, just walking up,
unaffected by what he had seen going on, dismissing it with, "they better ot
come up here." and then another guy came in and was completely thankful that
I had called 911; he gave me a big hug and I just started to cry on his
shoulder.</p>

<p class=dream>I could feel the texture of his shirt was a bit
strange.  I completely felt like my arms were hugging around him and I
realized I was dreaming.</p>

<p>I wondered if my arms were actually around something, but then realized
they really couldn't be given how I was laying. I slowly woke up to find
that my hands and forearms were right next to one another.  Cool how the
dream was so specific otherwise.</p>
