<p><p class=dream>With an ethnically diverse group of people at a
SWUUSI Young Adult type situation, talking in a cabin in the woods
after having witnessed a guy who was in charge of food try to fund
something by stealing the remainder of alcohol from a party next door
and everyone got mad at him for being so silly and thoughtlesss about
this community.</p>

<p class=dream>As i walked upstairs with my plate/bowl of food,
someone said, "so Rob," and I was surprised that they knew my name,
"how do you rectify the fact that Cornfed is going to japan next year
with your first impression that he was just a testosterone driven
hick?"</p>

<p class=dream>"That's a good question," I stalled.  "Hearing that
sotry from him definitely changed my view of who he must be.  I was
quite impressed to hear that and I wold like to get to know him a lot
better now.</p>

<p class=dream>interesting thing is that the woman who asked m e was
referring to Cornfed having gone to Japan during the war, and I was
referring to him going next year to teach English.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>At a rally at Aaron Ryan's house, like a farm and he
neeeded to cut down a large tree in his back yard and that fact had
been advertised on the rally flyer.  But when he cut it down, no one
was watching except me and it fell into a the neighbor's yard and
knocked down one of their trees.  Actually Aaron's tree was so
enormous that its branches basically dwarfed and bullied over the
neighbor's tree, and it fell on their roof and destroyed their garage
at first, and then smashed to bits their home.</p>

<p class=dream>They ran out of the house and we were all "oh shit" so
we ran over and I was thinking "ah they needed a new home anyway"
Their old house was unpainted now after years of wear and boards were
all falling apart and such.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>'you create a diversion," I said to my friend.</p>

<p class=dream>We were in a mental hospital, so he starting spraying
shaving cream on the walls and theatening to kill someone.</p>

<p class=dream>I became him and sprayed shaving cream thickly at the
floors, with a spray can powerful enough to shoot like a waterhose
worth of foam at once.  I said threatening things like, "I'm going to
kill so and so" or something and people started fleeing or calling the
cops and security in the hospital.</p>

<p class=dream>I was simply trying to keep them from getting my
friend.</p>

<p class=dream>I went up the wide staircase and sprayed shaving cream
all over the hard tile surface, making them quite slick and dangerous.
So when I saw someone starting to chase me, I ran back and jumped down
all the stairs and carefully slid on the tile and slid along the
corner wall and around the corner and jumped down the next flight of
steps......</p>

<p class=dream>So then I was running and jumped down some more stairs
and out a door and since I knew I had to do this for real, I decided
that I needed a real way to escape, so instead of flying, I had
installed a trapeeze outside the door hanging off the overhang roof
thing and jumped out the door and with such force that when I grabbed the
trapeze, I just flew up it in a 270 degree arc and flopped onto a big
soft foam rubber cushion on the roof.  safe.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>Driving Karaoke, Janette, and Jack really fast down
some clay hills streets of Dallas, except we were riding on a dolly.
Very fun wizzing around on that.</p>

<p class=dream>We headed quickly down a hill on which we had to turn
at the bottom, but they got off before we got to the bottom. I was a
bit offended that they wouldn't trust that I could stop the dolly
smoothly in time.  I did, but it was no problem to go back and get
them, knowing that I at least, had successfully navigated that hill at
high speed.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>At Northwoods last week Drew Barrymore had come to
visit and that she might come this week as well!  I wondered if it
would be worth it to drive the hour to church to possibly see her
(she's my girlfriend, but I just haven't told her yet), but it was
predicted that she wouldn't likely be there.</p>

<p class=dream>I ended up not going.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>In a hospital, working there, I am made aware by
listening in on a conversation between a doctor and nurse that the
hospital will make 800 dollars per year on a patient if we are able to
perform surgery on her this coming month.  We'll be guaranteed $800
per year after that..  The nurse is asked to try and get that surgery
'account.'</p>

<p class=dream>I am asked to narrate a filmstrip on stuff at the
hospital.  I'm presenting the filmstrip to some of my peers, and I
don't prepare for it all that well.</p>

<p class=dream>The first image is of a bunch of different people's
faces (men and women) and all of them are labeled Rebecca.</p>

<p class=dream>My audience (3 people) were gossipping, so I turned the
sound off on the TV to get their attention.</p>

<p class=dream>"I knew that would get your attention."</p>

<p class=dream>"Okay," I continued, "this image describes that the
hospital on one level takes care of individual patients and tries
caefullly to keep each individual alive.</p>

<p class=dream>"But on a different level, the hospital as an
institution, is trying to make money, and doesn't distingush between
the individual patients.</p>

<p class=dream>"The institution just wants the money and makes no
effort to really get to know the patients.</p>

<p class=dream>"We don't, for eaxample, record the patients' favorite
color or spouse's names exept for insurance collection purposes.  We
don't know their pets's name or anything that might be important to
the patient.  We just want to get them in and back out; we don't teach
them anything about how to stay out.</p>

<p class=dream>"In fact, it can be argued that the Western medicine
culture keeps people sick so the hospitals and drug companies can stay
in business."</p>

<p class=dream>My friends were pretty surprised at this, but they kept
watching my presentation.  I flipped to the next slide and it said
"mechanical" beneath a picture of a patient and I had no idea what it
was supposed to be about.</p>

<p>So I woke up.</p>

<p class=dream>Talking with the two members of NWA in my room.  They
were black in my dream with white skin.  I listened to their music and
it was really funny and creative and good.  I told them in honesty
that I now wish I had gotten into them a long time ago so I could have
grown up listening to their shit.</p>

<p class=dream>"But instead, I know all the songs by DJ Jazzy Jeff and
Fresh Prince, plus um, Beastie Boys, and a lot by Sir Mix-A-Lot...  Oh
and Eminem nowadays," which reminded me that I can <em>start</em>
listening to them (NWA) now.</p>

<p class=dream>They nodded understandingly and thoughtfully.  Ah, the
plight of a single lost listener.</p>

<p>Okay, so I woke up to this most recent dream:</p>

<p class=dream>I found myself outside of this (Norma's) house, and
walking past my old house.  Did they add on that garage?  Hmmm.  What
about that wall there?  I tried to visualize myself at 8 years old,
playing in these locations.  These were added onto the right hand side
of the house, as viewed from the street.  The house looked so small.
I was surprised by how quickly I walked past it and the other
houses.</p>

<p class=dream>I turned back around and noticed how I seemed to be out
of body; I could just let myself float anywhere I wanted to go; allow
my 8-year-old's mind just lead the way.</p>

<p class=dream>He looked up and I noticed my car was gone; I saw it
being driven toward the back of my old house, so I walked after it and
discovered that all the cars that had been parked in front of the
street there had been targeted.</p>

<p class=dream>I walked back there all mad at first, "hey! blah blah
blah" and then I immediately apologized and said, "I have a fantastic
story to tell you, and it's all true," to the guy who seemed to be the
boss of this operation.</p>

<p class=dream>Next to him were two Mexican cats and they looked quite
interested in my story so I asked "hablan ingles?" of them, and added
"muy bien o un poco?"</p>

<p class=dream>"Un poco," they smiled.</p>

<p class=dream>Ah well, so I didn't try to translate it for them; I
don't think I know that much spanish, even in my dreams.</p>

<p class=dream>"See that house there?"  We were behind it and couldn't
actually see it, but he knew where I was pointing.  "I used to live
there 24 years ago."</p>

<p class=dream>His stern look melted away.  "Really?"</p>

<p class=dream>"Yep, and I have just been talking to Norma and to
Jill, and they all said it was fine for me to park on the
street.."</p>

<p class=dream>"Well, this is the minimum I can charge you" and the
ticket had been crossed off from $80 to $30 to $3.00.  I thought about
asking him to just skip the whole thing, but I realized it as a dream
and that when we woke up, I would still have all my own money
back.</p>

<p class=dream>Hahah joke's on him!  I paid him three bucks and woke
up.</p>

<p class=note>(dreams)</p>

<p class=dream>Up in a tree I was on the phone with a friend of my
ex-DJ partner, Donna who changed her shift from 7 to 10pm to 10 to
1am, but still did the 7 to 10 shift at times.  I was standing way up
in the trunk of this tree talking KTRU gossip with these people on the
phone, and trying not to fall down out of the tree as I kept slowly
rocking back and forth looking at the schedule of DJs written on the
trunk of the tree written really small, like printed right on the
bark.</p>

<p class=dream>I climbed down and said bye to them and began walking
along this beach with Matt on the west coast, actually on the beach,
walking with Mattboy, looking down at the sand and marveling how there
could be ant holes down into the sand, and these were ants from
Saharah Desert, but this beach was so exotic that we got to see them
on our collective adventure.</p>

<p class=dream>"I'm so glad to connect with you guys on your
adventure," I told him.  "If you hadn't come to California to see
Abbey then I wouldn't have and I wouldn't have gotten to see this
incredibly cool beach."</p>

<p class=dream>"Yeah, these ants are pretty awesome" said Matt, as we
started walking into thicker jungle.</p>

<p class=dream>We started walking up a hill of sorts, full of branches
and brambles and leaves. In this jungle area, like a pine tree jungle
with the forest dense all around us as we climbed up this hill.</p>

<p class=dream>We marveled that there could be so much stuff and
wildlife in one area and then started to see we had climbed up onto a
refuse pile of branches and leaves and pine needles and such, as we
started to lose our footing and step through branches and end up up to
our knees in this pile of discarded clippings.</p>

<p class=dream>The pile started to give way and Matt and I were
tumbling down it, I was worried about ending up broken or crushed
beneath this gargantuan pile of branches, but we just kept tumbling
down, always somehow staying on top of the pile, or within eyes view
of the top.  Mattboy was falling above me in the pile, like directly
above me and we were laughin at the craziness of this adventure and
sorta self directing the fall as we just rode this tumbling pile of
branches all the way to the ground.  There were some barrel type
things that we could ride in, which were far too big for us to use
like shoes as the large giant inhabitants of this island preferred to
do.</p>

<p class=dream>Matt and I were tumbling down and discovered these
barrels and we were kinda inside the barrels and sorta able to steer
them down and not get too terribly poked and stabbed by pine needles
and branches on the way down.  Or get crushed at the bottom.</p>

<p class=dream>So we made it down and were all exhilirated by our
tumble and adventure in general and kept walking out of the forest and
discovered we were in a race track for the large island
inhabitants.</p>

<p class=dream>I hoped that we hadn't messed up the track too much for
them, as we walked out of the gate of the fence surrounding the
track.</p>

<p class=date>1:55am</p>

<p>---------</p>

<p class=date>3:15am</p>

<p class=dream>Flopping around in bed with some of my friends like at
a slumber party, we were chatting randomly and I wondered with
wondered if kine means false in Japanese.</p>

<p class=dream>I was all, "stupdid stupid 2 o'clock in the morning, I
have to wait forever before I can play outside" while I was putting
shorts on then I walked over toward the other room to see if my
japanese instructor happened to be awake.  Her daughter was there
(Hannah from Memphis) and I asked her if her mom was awake.</p>

<p class=dream>"No, she's on a date with her boyfriend."</p>

<p class=dream>Then the actor from Dirty Dancing and Tango and Cash
walked in and asked the same question</p>

<p class=note>(the dream had been with me in first person now changed
to me watching)</p>

<p class=dream>He asked the sme question, and then Hannah was all,
"no, and her boyfriend could kick your ass in his sleep."</p>

<p class=dream>Guy said, "that's easy, I have 3 broken ribs and I need
to go you know what!"</p>

<p class=dream>So the next scene in this movie showed a close up of
tomato juice being poured out of a water house around a glass
cylinder.  Guy was breathing through the glass tube and the tomato
juice was being poured directly into his stomach too help loosen him
up a bit.</p>

<p class=dream>In this movie, the next scene showed a full view like
an X-ray view except it was in full color (a la <em>XXX</em>) and we
could see that the tomato juice had only been actually poured into his
stomach like a single ounce worth.  the water hose scene was just for
effect.</p>

<p class=dream>Next scene showed him as a news anchor, very seriously
relaying the news and then suddenly having to get up, with the
implication being that in about 2 seconds he would have to get up to
use the restroom.  The scene cut with him getting up during the news
suddenly and saying "excuse me.."</p>

<p class=date>3:26am</p>

<p>-----------</p>

<p class=date>???am</p>

<p class=dream>Driving along a highway that spiraled down slowly where
I needed to exit, but the exit ramp was blocked.  Cops were watching
to see that no one went down the exit, but I recognized I was dreaming
and jumped out of my car and ran along the exit and then jumped off
where the concrete ended abruptly in the air.</p>

<p class=dream>I flew well above the circular spiral of a highway and
looked for a way to fly down to the bottom where I needed to go.  The
spiral was so tight that the center of the spiral was only about 2
feet wide, and might be difficult for me to make it through.</p>

<p class=dream>I recognized that I could just punch through the
concrete with my feet, like just fly straight down to it in a standing
position so I did that and punched through a few levels of the
concrete spiral, then shifted toward the center of the spiral so it
was easier to just fly through it.</p>

<p>-----------</p>

<p class=date>6:42am</p>

<p class=dream>Hosting a party at my house, which was like multiple
rooms all connected in a line moreso than in a square.  Fred was on a
different schedule than me; he and his friends had been playing on the
computers, but now had gone off to eat somewhere even though I usually
went with them, but it was cool; I had other stuff to do.</p>

<p class=dream>One room was empty, and then I walked into the next
room and all these people from school (Maggie, Molly, Danielle,
Marcel, Kayse) with a bunch of other people were all chillin' and
talking about random whatevers all over the place.  I greeted
different people and thanked them for coming, and Danielle smiled and
turned her back toward me in a "you could give me a back massage if
you want" type of way.</p>

<p class=dream>I massaged her back some, but couldn't really do a good
job because she kept talking and laughing and tensing up her muscles,
so I quit and then she looked down at her leg and a spider had just
bitten her leg!</p>

<p class=dream>She was all "yeow!" and I brushed the spider off and it
ran over to some guy I didn't know, who was studying from a thick
textbook and the spider climbed onto his clean fuzzy light beige
boots.  I got a napkin and killed it so that we could identify it.</p>

<p class=dream>The spider was the shape of a daddy longlegs, but its
body was light green with about twenty tiny blue spots on it.  My dad
didn't think I could find any information on it, but I went over to
the computer and clicked on the first web browser that I saw (happened
to be Explorer) and he was all, "why'd you use Explorer?  Netscape is
better.."</p>

<p class=dream>"Because I'm in a hurry and any ol fuckin' web browser
will be fine to do a search on google."</p>

<p class=dream>The machine was being slow, so I clicked Alt-N to open
a new window (that's what it is on Macs), but it rebooted the
machine.  Doh!</p>

<p class=dream>So we went out of the loud room and into the quiet room
and got onto that computer, but someone had changed all the fonts so
each letter looked like a little marble (3-D and everything) on the
screen, with each different letter showing a different marble with a
different design, that (to me) looked nothing like the letter it
apparently represented.</p>

<p class=dream>I moved the mouse cursor to what looked like an image
of a lake where googles search box is ususally located, and typed the
marbles into the lake, where they floated around and performed the
search.</p>

<p class=dream>The whole concept was surprising to me and I woke up.</p>

<p>--------</p>

<p class=date>8:38am</p>

<p class=dream>Looking in the back of Scott as I was ready to leave,
lots of laundry in there.</p>
