<p class=note>(most extensive dream ever)</p>

<p>&lt;! p class=dream I took a risk and told Sally how much I love her,
while we&gt; <p class=dream>Sally and I
were hanging out at some small city that I&rsquo;ve never previously been.
We were in her old neighbohood, inside a cafe type thing, with lots of
other students, all friends.  Sally was eating some toast from
another&rsquo;s plate and after a while I reached over to get some eggs off
this plate that had apparently been abandoned, and she was all, &ldquo;oh!
no, those are his; he still wants the eggs, just not the toast.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p>&lt;!p class=dream She told me that she likes affection and kisses and
cuddling, and sitting on lap hugging, and that I can show her
affection that way.&gt;</p>

<p class=dream>We were in an old garage looking for something, as
there was some common enemy, looming in the near future, the possible
end of the world via aliens or something.</p>

<p class=dream>In this garage were lots of small parts and tools like
an auto garage, with rags and grease and half started and half
finished projects all over the place.</p>

<p class=dream>We came across an object that looked like a long sharp
tusk with some buldges down in its length.  This turned out to be a
mysterious otherworldly object,, a portal to a whole 'nother univere
at its very tip.  For if one were to look down at the very tip of this
tusk, there would appear an intricate city of infinite expanse all
within this tiny point. Any different angle one viewed the tusk tip
would bring into view a different portion of this universe, each of
which seemed to never end.  As if all the points of view from that
other universe were focused onto this tiny point.</p>

<p class=dream>Scientists on our side did not undersand this
phenomenon, and generally feared it, and feared for the safety of
humans who studied it too carefully, thinking they might be
assimilated or fall into this other universe somehow.</p>

<p class=dream>Though this universe in a point was outside in a dense
jungle, and surrounded as if guarded by an intense cloud of
mosquitoes, thousands of human visitors flocked to it, just to get a
glimpse of this magical phenomenon.</p>

<p class=dream>Fred pulled out some super mosquito spray, and I was
all, "why would you think necessarily that their mosquitoes would be
affected by our mosquito spray?"</p>

<p class=dream>"I can't know for sure, bit it's possibly better than
nothing."</p>

<p class=dream>As our group walked across the mall parking lot toward
this forest with the mystery point, Fred doused himself in mosquito
spray, and hardly noticed that others might need it as well.  As we
crossed paths with a japanese girl she said, "you'll need more than
that."</p>

<p class=dream>"More than that what?" I asked, wondering if she was
talkng about the mosquitoes.</p>

<p class=dream>"The mosquitoes back there are amazing.  You will each
need that much spray, and even that might not be enough."</p>

<p class=dream>Wow.</p>

<p>I woke up.</p>

<p>My dreams featured Jennifer from Paint This!, in a big new store,
and a customer that was trying to hit on me or something.</p>

<p>Fred showed up in a later dream; he was also on a road trip, and
jokingly asked me if I wanna race.  I was all "sure," and held my
hands side by side like two cars and then made them drive off
quickly... in opposite directions.</p>

<p>I'm so funny, even in my sleep.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>Walking with Barbie maybe, and came across a house
under construction.  I needed some 2x4s to use as stakes in my house
to help me sell it.  Inside the garage of this house (not mine) I
found some pieces of 2x4 about 4 feet long with pointy ends to use as
a stake.  Found four pieces.  Also found 4 smaller pieces to be used
for something else.</p>

<p class=dream>Barbie motioned for me to wait, as I had began to walk
out the door; she wanted to wait for Dr Dre who was also in the garage
getting some stuff that he needed.  While we waited, the owner of the
house came into the garage and caught us stealing his shit.</p>

<p class=dream>He asked what was the next thing I intended to do with
the boards I had.</p>

<p class=dream>"Um, go to my house and use them as stakes."  I had
decided not to lie and get myself in more trouble.</p>

<p class=dream>He asked if I had been there to his house
previously.</p>

<p class=dream>"no"</p>

<p class=dream>"really?" he asked, as if to make sure I hadn't
forgotten about it.</p>

<p class=dream>"yes I have never been hear before.  Today is my first
day."</p>

<p class=dream>"You didn't steal a shirt from me that said Marathon on
it?"</p>

<p class=dream>"no, but I read abotut it in the newspaper."</p>

<p class=dream>"Anyone could have heard about it on the news" he
said, trying to make that statement implicate me.</p>

<p class=dream>I made a joke, yeah Barbie said the samething, "if
I..they stole it they could just look down and know what it said on
the shirt."  She had said 'I' but I switched the word to 'they' at the
last minute to keep him from thinking she was really talking about
me.</p>

<p class=dream>"He tried to use magic marker and make it look like a
top ten countdown."</p>

<p class=dream>"Reeealy?  I did not know that." I considered this next
part before saying it.  "With all due respect, this shirt will be a
lot mor valuable after it's been so famous."</p>

<p class=dream>He rolled his eyes.</p>

<p class=dream>"I know this is not the type of publicity you'd like to
get, but it's true."</p>

<p class=dream>He said something about fifty dollars for the shirt,
but I thought he was offering to let me pay fifty dollars for the wood
and let me off without prosecution.</p>

<p class=dream>"Okay" and I reached for my wallet because I had fifty
dollars in it.</p>

<p class=dream>He looked confused.</p>

<p class=dream>I was all, "I thought you were offering to
acept fifty dollars from me so you wouldn't prosecute me."</p>

<p class=dream>No response.</p>

<p class=dream>"I'm just trying to stay out of jail.  If fifty bucks
will do it, then that's fine."</p>

<p class=dream>He considered a moment and then accepted the offer, but
then said something like , "blah blah blee bloo and your friends won't
be implicated."</p>

<p class=dream>I was all, "what?"</p>

<p class=dream>He spoke again, but this time it was different, so I
recognized I was dreaming, and woke up and kept my fifty bucks.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>With my Aunt Madeleine in a parking lot at her car,
kinda inside a building with some water nearby, and she started to get
ill or fall under water and I couldn't really keep her afloat, so I
hollered at someone to call 911, but they ignored me, so I grabbed her
phone and called 911 while trying to keep her from sinking and the
operator was all, "you have to call a different number" and she
wouldn't connect me.  I got really mad and was all, "just fucking
connect me to the number; my aunt is fucking drowning here!"</p>

<p class=dream>She never connected me, but some lady saw our plight
and was willing to help, and put Madeleine in her van but left me in
the water, which was no problem cause I got out easily.</p>

<p>I'm glad it was a dream.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>At a Wal-mart, outside in the parking lot and sorta
loitering there waiting for them to open because they were closed
having an employee only meeting.  I packed my stuff up and my backpack
was too light; my computer wasn't in it.  I freaked a bit and went
into the front of the store in an attempt to walk through and get my
coputer that I thought I had left on the other side of the building,
but some employee was all, "I'm sorry sir, blah blah blah" and I tried
to be all polite and went back out and ran around the store and I
heard him call me so I turned around but he didn't see me, thinking
that I had already gone around, so he went back inside, and I
<em>ran</em>, trying to get around the entire store before he was able
to walk through the center.  and some woman came out, "all "you forgot
your computer over by the loading dock" and I was all, "I assure you I
did <em>not</em> forget it; I was coming back here right now to get
it." and she was all, "fine" and then I started cussing and just let
my inner Slim Shady throw anger out into the world cause I was so mad
that someone would think I might forget my computer somewhere or that
I would not know exactly where it was at all times.</p>

<p class=dream>Some cats from KTRU were there to comfort me - Ben, and
some new DJs, like freshmen who I had never previously met.  I hugged
Ben all bigly and thanked him for his support.  His eyes teared a
little bit and then Maggie was there and asked how I was doing and I
told her an overwiew and then I realized I had missed my job starting
date with Star Pizza or Amy's Ice Cream and that I had just been
having so much fun that I forgot to go back to them on a certain
Monday tahat I said I would.</p>

<p class=dream>I woke up with Eminem lyrics in my head "y'all are
steady tryin' to drown a shark"</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>Driving a car around a block and needing to drop off
Dude and Gene, but at first thinking that I couldn't go but to within
a block of where they needed to be dropped off, but then I realized I
could, so I turned left up this small driveway into a parking lot and
dropped them off.</p>

<p class=dream>They had just helped me carry something in my car to
somewhere or some shit like that.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class=dream>In a neighborhood street and up in a window of a two
story house, a little girl was calling to me for attention.  She and I
didn't know each other, but she came running downstairs with her arms
up like, "pick me up" so I did and I asked her name and she said
"Cinderella" secretly and then "Mindy" as her real name but then went
on to explain why she called herself Cinderella.  I told her that I
understood and she didn't have to explain it.</p>

<p class=dream>I did know her older sister, but didn't get a clear
idea of who she was.  Someone from my college days.</p>

<p class=date>9:21am</p>

<p>I just realized that none of my dreams seem to go backward in time,
like some movies (Momento) or even others that don't go entirely
backwards, but somewhat backwards.  Or maybe they do and I don't
realize it.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>In a library writing html to represent entries in a
checkbook register, I was just hardcoding all the entries themselves,
and then realized that it would be much easier in the long run to
write a template and let the entries be stored in a database and let
the comptuer format them nicely.</p>

<p class=dream>I paced around the library a bit and my laptop power
cord got stuck on the opposite side of a shelf than where I had been
so I untangled it and woke up.</p>

<p class=dream>In a something above the ground like 40 feet up and one
of my youth jumped out and his parachute didn't open so he kinda
bonked on the ground, but he was okay.  He pulled his parachute out
like gosh darn stupid parachute!  and then he tossedthe top part of a
rop up to me and it took a few tries but I caught it and then pulled
him up to our level again.  Since the parachute was already open, I
dropped him down and it worked nicely.   He floated down to the ground
very slowly.</p>

<p class=dream>Near my dad's house, I was dropped off by the
elementary school and Colleen Crotty (Saube) was there and she was
trying to get home, but it started to rain a bit - a cold rain so she
started jogging and I jogged along with her to make sure she got home
safely.  We got up to my dad's street and Fred was there chillin' in a
van with a bunch of stuff on the hood and I was all, "let me borrow
it" and he started throwing the stuff (skates, blankets, etc) into the
van.  Colleen got in and I was driving and Fred stood on the sideboard
as I drove slowly to Colleen's house (not too far away).</p>

<p class=dream>Some cattle were standing in the road, and one
particularly bullheaded (or just dumb) cow was standing there and we
actually pushed him out of the way with the van.  Then we had to get
through the gate that led into her neighborhood and it seemed really
narrow but I used some sort of extension on the van to push part of
the gate open on both sides; it was like a piece of sheetmetal hanging
on some rebar pegs extending horizontally from the vertical wooden
posts on either side of the gate.</p>

<p>Another dream was something about work, but I don't remember.</p>

<p class=dream>something about my ex-work.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>I was somewhere and Heather from back in my high school
days called and came to visit!  We hadn't been in touch for a long
time, lke a few years, so it was good to catch up, but we didn't
really talk about much.  When she first saw me, she said, 'you look
good; you look like Mr Reagh,' which was a total compliment  cause he
was one of our best teachers in the world. in high school.  As we were
talking some of my youth fom Northwoods, Susie Scully and Hethre were
being silly and purposely standing  or sitting almost in the way of
our conversaion.  It was funny.</p>

<p>I think it's time I email Heather.</p>
