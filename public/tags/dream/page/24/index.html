<div class="dream">
I just woke up from a dream where I was living in a house with
several people that I didn't really trust, and I found a gun left
carelessly under a desk.  I had to sneak away to call the police and
explain to them the situation but I couldn't call 911 because the
phone was triggered to alarm if 911 was called so I had to call the
non emergency police number, but I couldn't look it up.  I finally
guessed the number after tons of tries and then I woke up as I was on
hold waiting for them to answer...
</div>

<p>I&rsquo;m just writing to express lovely gratitude that my life is so
much simpler than this dream!  I woke up feeling thankful to be in my
waking reality!!</p>

<p><p>I just woke up cleanly from a clear dream.  Wende and I were trying
to find the owner of a cat, and we went to the cat&rsquo;s apartment, which
was right down the street from me..  We had never met the people
before, but I talked to the guy about this idea I had for using the
Internet to connect people with special talents and skills.  In my
dream, he thought it was a great idea.  <em>Bing</em> I woke up.</p>

<p><p>Here&rsquo;s the idea in a nutshell: use the Internet to connect people
with special talents to people who have a project that needs those
special talents.</p>

<p><p>1) Have jillions of people visit a data collecting website and
enter their talents, skills, resources, and contact information.</p>

<p><p>2) People with a project in mind would enter what type of skills
they need for a project.  The database would present a list of
matching skills but with no names or contact information.  The project
person could then send an email to a specific email address that would
send it to each of the people in the new list.  Each individual could
respond if they were interested in the project.</p>

<p><p>There.  That&rsquo;s the project.  Now if only there was a website that
could help me find people with the following skills:</p>

<p><p><b>Project: eProjects.com</b>
<ul>
<li>someone to market the site and concept
<li>someone who can write the database and interface
<li>a server on which to host the site
<li>someone with cash to pay for the server and marketing
<li>help brainstorming how to make people <em>want</em> to visit the site and type in all their special skills
<li>help brainstorming how to jog people&rsquo;s memories of their hidden talents
</ul></p>

<p><p>Brugh Joy, MD has written at least two books.  In one of them, he described having a vision of the chapter outline of a book he would write.  He tried to put it out of his mind and sleep, but could not.  He wrote down the outline from his vision, then was able to sleep.</p>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s now 3:48am.  I&rsquo;m going back to sleep.</p>

<p>I fell asleep instead of doing a Shamanic Journey.</p>

<p class="dream">This morning I dreamnt [sic] that I was with Madonna and that she was living with
me in dad's house.  She did my laundry for me and interacted with me as friend and lover.</p>

<p>I don't remember actually kissing her, but I bet that's how I met her in the dream.</p>

<p class="dream">We flirted &amp; almost went skinny dipping in the pond behind dad's house but
there were other guys there so I didn't.  Madonna drove Fred's bug around the Peden
&quot;block&quot; <del>)</del> and almost got busted for speeding.</p>

<p class="dream">I just had a long dream about Melanie Barr we were in her room and some dudes ran
by outside naked &amp; we turned off the lights to <del>wa</del> see who it was and Melanie &amp; I
didn't kiss or anything, but she acted as if she were a much closer friend to me than in 'real'
life.  She accepted my suggestions &amp; hugged me and inquired about little scars or other

<p class="dream">Last night I had a dream.  I was walking with 4 or 5 different girls.  I had been
working in a Target-like store and there was a beautiful female customer and I asked her if there
was anything I could do for her.  Anything.  She told me that her new job was skydiving.  I fell at
her feet and began to kiss her feet.  Then she was sucking my balls and licking and it was
orgasmic.</p>

<p class="dream">Then I was walking with 4 or 5 different girls and french kissing each of them in
turn.  Each of them watched as I kissed the others and they all wanted to kiss and kiss.</p>

<p class="dream">Then there were 3 brothers sitting cross legged &amp; they were Buddhist (sp) and
they thought themselves into flight.</p>

<p class="dream">Then there was a huge box of lids from the pharmacy that were being recycled.
There were so many that they were sorted by color &amp; still filled several huge containers.
Then there was an organization like SPB and they recycled all the lids.</p>

<p><p>Last night I had a dream that</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was at the airport, and a skycrane helicopter
descended and picked up 4 people, each with a HUGE umbrella over
them.  These umbrellas must have been 10 or 12 feet in
<em>radius</em>. 20-24 feet diameter, (Duh).  Then there was a problem
and 2 umbrellas crashed and came tumbling, so I ran over there and
talked to the two girls that fell.  They were Ok, and I somehow knew
them (probably supposedly from Rallies, since I just talked to Karina
last night) So we talked for a big and I flirted with one and then we
planned to go swimming.</p>

<p><p>Then I woke up and had a huge hard on so I jacked off and imagined
Noelle coming over and me fucking her.  Now I&rsquo;m going to get busy:
laundry, recycling, and a few phone calls. (BBB about the company that
said I won 3-D camera and NCNB about my loan application)  Later</p>

<p>No lucid dreams.  It's 5:50AM.  I dreamt that I was at a store
looking for Jams. Danny Dillard showed up and thought that was funny.
Next thing I know, I'm sitting with my back against a wall and a wall
is on my left.  There are some girls on my right against the wall.  In
front of me is an open area, maybe a store or a cafeteria.  Terra
Suter crawled into my lap and I had my arm around her and held her
other hand.  She turned into Vanessa Payne and started arguing with
the girl on my right.  I think <em>she</em> was Vanessa Payne too.
Wierd!  6:10</p>
