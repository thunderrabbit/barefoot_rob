<div class="dream">
Floating on a rubber aft, lofted by the wind I was disconnected from
thwe ship's mast for a while, but was able to swim through the air to
get back to it a few times.  After a bit, I seemed not able to get
back, so my friend went to ask for help, but while he was gone, I made
it back and shimmied down the mast along with the raft. The crew who
came to help saw the equipment I had and praised me saying that I did
everything correctly and wouldn't have had a problem even without
their help.

<p><em>I was in a small room, controlled by the government that was a bit like prison but not completely terrible conditions and it was time for alien disclosure but they were doing it in a very specific way. Some spider webs were in my room in the corner, and there was a pillow but nothing else. I was asked to lie face down with pillow ofer my head and to cover my ears as the aliens were revealed and each person could be shwon the aliens under supeision and not get freaked out. I was already not freaked out and planned to not cover my ears and couldn&rsquo;t lie face down because under pillow plus face down meant I couldn&rsquo;t breathe. I lay down face up with the pillow like a dome over my head and covered my ears fakely so I could hear but it looked like I was covering. I could hear the guy talking to the alien and he goes, &ldquo;face up?&rdquo; because the alien apparently ratted on me and he checked me and I was like yeah I can&rsquo;t breathe otherwise. He confirmed I coudln&rsquo;t see anything and allowed it.</em></p>

<p>_
Eventually I wa able to see the aliens, starting with seeing them out in the yard, and was a bt curious to see they loked like very large rats. Each prson outside was assigned an alient partner, and the humans were treated them ike pets, which the aliens were allowing s they knew we just needed to get it out of our system. I was determined to treat mine more respectfully so when I was assigned my alien I immediately asked if I could learn their language. I had a large book with alien symbols (looking something like Thai writing, but with a lot more space inside and between the letters). I was talking to my alien partner and asking questions about why it seemed to take so long and why go about disclosure in this way and the reply was this is how our government wanted it and how the people seemed ready for it. I explained that we each had the ability to think without the government so they could have asked us individually. He said they had, but we didn&rsquo;t hear them. Hmmmm._</p>

<p><em>We had been retreating but I realized it was &ldquo;that place where I can control things&rdquo; so I went toward them firing arrows at me.  I wasn&rsquo;t hit/hurt by any arrows and I got close enough to shoot some of them, but didn&rsquo;t because it wouldn&rsquo;t be nice, so I found an old cave where we had had a school or something and went down into it and turned right behind an old saloon that was filled with chairs and stuff.  I leapt up to the second floor balcony and was able to move some plywood out of the way so I could close the shutters and wait there for the war to be over.</em></p>

<p><em>Riding in the back of a bus, after there had been a pretty devastating earthquake, but we were still trying to go somewhere, and the driver had to back up a try again to go this way or that way around the city to get to where we were going.  I was sitting in the back, and Lin was sitting a few seats ahead of me.  I had the whole back seat to myself and at one point the bus had to bak up and it seemed to tilt a bit precariously, and I was glad no one was in the seat with me because if we tipped over, it would mean they&rsquo;d all fall onto me, or me onto them and it would have been a mess.  With no one, then I could just stand up on the side of the window  or something.</em></p>

<p><em>Then there was an older woman sitting next to me and she had also done some classes with Clairvision, so we were talking a bit  and I showed her a book I was reading, and then the woman across from the table across the table from us was like interesting book and asked if she could look at it.  When she opened it, a small sponge fell out; apparently it had been inside the book. I kind of remember having putting it in the book, and I could see some of its sides had been damaged from being smushed in the book,but it still had its pyramid shape when unsmashed,   There was a pin in it, so I  tried not to smash it and be pricked with the pin and I warned the woman next to me oh there&rsquo;s a pin, and then I noticed there were a lot of pins, and the woman across the table had a lot of pins in a pin cushion as well.  I was like, &ldquo;is this yours then?  and she looked at it like, no it&rsquo;s not mine.. and then another book fell out of the first book; it was an introduction to unitarian universalism, and I handed it to the woman next to me while the woman across the table continued reading the first book. </em></p>

<p><em>Then another woman came up and asked &ldquo;for a free reading,&rdquo; which I thought was a bit rude at first, but then noted that she had green ectoplasm just oozing out of her temples, like something had really gone wrong.   I wondered if it was real, and the woman next to me said, we&rsquo;re probably seeing some kind of after effect and it may phase in and out of view, a and as the woman was talking her far  the affected woman was talking her face became like a skull and dry white hair and emaciated gross but still talking and wondering what was happening.  I sat and tried to maintain composure and then noted her color came back, her hair turned to a healthy black perm and she looked like Julia Roberts with a black perm and she was still talking, and the ectoplasm had vanished and everything seemed a lot better. Then as she began to change back to skeleton ectoplasm straw white hair, I interrupted excitedly, &ldquo;you know what?  you look just like Julia Roberts! I just realized that&rdquo; and then I thought to myself, &ldquo;oh crud I hope she likes Julia Roberts&rdquo; and the woman goes, &ldquo;really?  that&rsquo;s so sweet!&rdquo; something something and  her face kept turning into a skull and grossness and then I woke up.</em></p>

<em>Sho was discussing with Jonas about a new site, and I wanted to work on something but didn&rsquo;t have enough information to get started on my site.  I tried to get back to work and the scene shifted.</em></p>

<p><em>At our old house again, my mom went outside to sleep in the pullman trailer and I went to my old rom. I heard a noise with sounded like the neighbors pulling trailers around so I went outside to make sure they were only pulling their own trailers.  the light was on inside but both switches were off, so I tried to turn the right one on, but then just went outside and found my mom reading in the back of a station wagon and she was like &ldquo;I was just reading something you wrote; was this recent or a long time ago?  you said &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t wat to grow old&rsquo;&rdquo; and I was like, &ldquo;well I can&rsquo;t imagine it was recent; I don&rsquo;t remember it; maybe I was 9 years old&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>Dusk was approaching on a rainy night and we got a knock at the door. I opened it and a western looking guy wearing a backpack introduced himself. &ldquo;HI; I&rsquo;m Joe from Nagano,&rdquo; and I interrupted him, &ldquo;you came from Nagano??&rdquo; &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. &ldquo;Okay sorry please continue..&rdquo; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m was working in IT there but lost my job so I&rsquo;m looking for IT work in Tokyo..&rdquo; He was dripping a bit with rain, so I offered him to come in. He stepped up onto the wooden entry and I said &ldquo;shoes off outside, please&rdquo; and he stepped back outside. I then said &ldquo;wait. I don&rsquo;t personally have work for you, but I have a contact who might. You look cold, so I&rsquo;m offering to give you a warm place to sleep for tonight, BUT there is still some light outside; you can push on and maybe find a job, or you can come inside; it will be dark in about 30 minutes; you can come back after visiting a couple more houses.</em></p>

<p>He considered the options for a minute and then came inside. I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Rob and this is Sabina,&rdquo; as Sabina came up to see the visitor. She&rsquo;s traveling as well so may be able to give a few tips on making money in Japan.
Sabina started asking him questions animatedly, and they hit it off right away. She took him into her room and closed the door; I could hear them talking as I started doing dishes, washing a large tray with a painted tree on it, actually a large tree in a forest of trees, with lots of green deep green with some of the paint chipping off. I started to scrape more paint off while washing and thought I should have gotten back in touch with Sabina sooner because now she&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;m just getting back to her because she has a new friend and she&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;m jealous. But really I&rsquo;ve wanted to get back in touch the whole time but just didn&rsquo;t know what to say. So I made a decision to talk to her as soon as possible when she came back out of her room and then I woke up.</p>

<p><em>Was in south pacific island and was admiring the piercings of some of the locals.  An older guy held two needles in a downward non-threatening way and nodded his head toward me questioningly.  I was like &ldquo;sure!&rdquo; and approached him.  He  quickly and painlessly inserted needles in either side of my upper lip, then out a bit lower, so they didn&rsquo;t actually pierce into the mouth; just like subcutaneous, but not deeper than that.</em></p>

<p><em>Driving Mr Van with Colleen and my family, we arrived at a place where we had just been druing thew inter.  In winter the stream had lights and snow and looked quite different from no lights and no snow version as it was now.  Colleen commented on that and I was like, &ldquo;yeah that was a once in a lifetime opportunity because I&rsquo;ve heard they&rsquo;re not going to do the lights next year.&rdquo;  We turned right to go into the gated area and it was locked.  I jumped up to examine the lock, and the lock opened as I touched it.  I still had to disconnect the lock from the gate, and I found another button that did so.  They drove the van through after I kicked open the gate, and I was  still hanging on near the lock area but the gate stayed open.  My dad even drove the van on a door frame on the gate to keep it open longer but that didn&rsquo;t help close it as hoped.</em>  Something else and then my alarm rang.</p>

<p><em>hanging out with Trent Reznor of nine inch nails (still?), I got to really ask him and hear some of his thoughts about stuff. I was like &ldquo;oh I know what I can tell you that&rsquo;s personal, different than just &lsquo;omg I love your music&rsquo; which is true, or I wouldn&rsquo;t be here now, but I feel sad that I didn&rsquo;t try to engaage you personally earlier. I mean I was listening to you in 1986 when Down in It came out.  And actually, I thought the lyrics for the refrain &lsquo;I was up above it&rsquo; were &lsquo;How is everybody?&rsquo; and they entire crowd answers back like ten thousand people screaming yeah [we are great],&rdquo; and he interrupted a bit, &ldquo;it cost 84000 dollars to make that, atually just to pay the students for that day cause we took an entire day with them and they each had to be paid 84 dollars so times a thousand, and we had to have only modern students who were also drivers,&rdquo; and he went into the details a bit and then someone called and apparently said, &ldquo;yo trent this is Chuck we are at the airport now&rdquo; and he said to them, &ldquo;okay call me when you get here&rdquo; and hung up, but then to me, &ldquo;I have no idea who Chuck is; I doubt they know how to get here. I don&rsquo;t have time to answer to everyone&rsquo;s whim like I wish people knew I didn&rsquo;t.</em></p>

<p>_before that I had been hanging out with Fred, including at a hotel, overlooking a city where we had been playing for a while.  The night sky was crystal clear and he was showing me something about the cars on the street way down below us. He had some puzzles out on the table and I remember having played with them for a while before he had to put them away, but before he put them away, we were talking about this or that _</p>

<p>At the very end of the dream, I noted a tiny distinction between I&rsquo;m asleep and I&rsquo;m awake. or I noticed that the distinction was tiny. Why is that? What is that? I wonder how long I can ease around that distinction, experiencing it, and can I flip back from dream reality to awake reality to deam reality with ease? I should be able to, but how do I learn how to do it?</p>
