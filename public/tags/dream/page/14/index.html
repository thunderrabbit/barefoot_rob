<p class=dream>I had to get up to go pee, and I figured I could just
go back to the little bathroom and pee but when I got there it had no
walls, so I used a sleeping bag to cover me while I was there.  But
there was no way to hang the sleeping bag from the ceiling anymore,
and I was surprised that I hadn't thought this through a bit more
completely; when I got up to pee it seemed like everything would go
smoothly, that all conditions were accounted.</p>

<p class=dream>Once I was there, some guys were sitting near a stack
of firewood discussing grades in their college classes.  One cat was
talking on a cell phone telling his friend on the other end of the
conection how the school the friend was attending was a really
difficult school in history so he should feel fine about geting a 3.5
in history class, but the friend pointed out that he was going to
school for history and therefore he should get a better grade in that
class than all the others.</p>

<p class=dream>I just looked at the shapes of the logs of firewood and
wondered if they were all different lengths or if they were just
stacked not lined up.  I could only see one end of the logs as they
were stacked.</p>

<p class=dream>One guy asked me what I was looking at and I told him
and he was all, "no really, what are you looking at?" as if I could
not possibly be thinking about firewood lengths.</p>

<p>a rooster is crowing across the street.</p>

<p class=dream>Janette and I were walking and climbed up a sand hill.
a bad guy came up behind us and a friend came up on the other side of
this hill.  I told the friend if the bad guy shoots at us, you run to
the cops. There were cops sitting in police cars not too far away.</p>

<p class=dream>The bad guy shot a nail gun at me and I blocked it,
ending up with a small pierce in my hand, but I started hollering like
"hey there's some guy with a nail gun!" and ran over toward the cops
and one came over and tried to diffuse the guy holding the nail gun.
I didn't have to prove he shot me; the cat had a nail gun and the cop
was stopping him for that.</p>

<p class=dream>The guy had a knife too and it took a few tries for any
of us (cop, Janette, me) to get him.  Finally I got him by his wrists
and woke up.</p>

<p>Earlier dream:</p>

<p class=dream>Driving with Jennifer Nunnaly from PT! over a bridge
under construction.  She had done it many times before, but I had not.
she was driving.</p>

<p class=dream>We got caught while on the bridge and she tried to
ignore them, navigate around all the consruction materials and get
down safely without being caught.  She put a strip of burlap over an
identifying feature of her car and we finally got down.</p>

<p class=dream>A guy found us and was trying to negotiate with us and
he said he needed a pair of white underwear so I was all if I give it
to you will you forget this ever happened?  He thought for a minute
and said he'll forgive all past events but if we go up again, that
would have to be dealt with at that time.</p>

<p class=dream>Driving by a big field with a large flat rock and a
bunch of guys sitting on the rock, all wearing construction outfits, i
turned around and walked up all barefoot to say HI and figure out why
a bunch of guys wer sitting on this large flat rock.</p>

<p class=dream>I got a bit good naturedly harassed for no soes and
ignored it, "Well it doesn't take shoes to sit on a big rock.  What
are you guys doing?</p>

<p class=dream>And it turned out they were all painting like
transcribing from canvas paintings, they wre painting onto newspaper
that had been layed across the rock, and the idea was they would place
colored tiles on the rock to fit the image.  There was a painting with
a little bit of landscape and a small tree and some red sky for a
sunset image and the red paint was still wet.  I acidentally touched
it and then touced the whit ground under the horizon line, placing a
red dot on the canvas, not on the newspaper.  Since the newspaper had
already been painted, it did not include the dot.  I told them, "I
fucked something p, I put a red dot on the canvas here, but it's
already been painted to the newspaper."  "Oh, don't worry about it; if
the touch up person comes back through and puts a red dot there it's
okay.  I like it better with the red dot."  "I'm gonna come back by
again in a few years and if that red dot is there, I'll be all 'I put
that red dot there!' 'No you didn't' 'Yes I did!'"</p>

<p class=dream>I was in school, like a college situation, and it was
my last day to be there; I was leaving in the middle of the semester.
Super happy and nostalgic and went down to the cafeteria, sitting
between two girls I hadn't met before across from a friend of mine,
randomly yammering about what it will be like in my new life, and what
it will be like here when I'm gone.  Bryn was wandering around
randomly and didn't say bye to me though I'm pretty sure she knew I
was leaving.  Scotty was like, "this is it? your last day?" and gave
me a air high five across the room.</p>

<p class=dream>Fred got there as I was finishing up my bowl of
applesauce and dancing, mirroring some group of people dancing on the
other side of the table.  I felt happy enough to dance with applesauce
in the middle of the cafeteria and didn't care what anyone thought
cause today is my last day!</p>

<p>Woah.  I'm reminded that I had a dream last night.  I'm not sure if
the dream happened before or after my mouthguard cracked.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>In my dad's living room, my grandpa/dentist was sitting
on the couch to my back right, and his wife was on the recliner to my
front left.  He was looking through pictures and came across some that
showed my teeth before he had worked on them to make the front teeth
all straight and such.</p>

<p class=dream>He showed the picture to grandma, and I proudly showed
her the resulting teeth.</p>

<p>I don't know how my dentist got to be my grandfather in my dream.
Maybe that is based on Wende's PawPaw being a dentist.</p>

<p class=dream>Reading some literature about how Amway has the finest,
most effective sales and marketing plan in the US. How they've got
distribution centers all over the place, in about 20 different states.
How I can make a pile of money in commissions selling, for example,
refrigerators to restaurants, like Jason's restaurant back when he had
a restaurant.</p>

<p class=dream>Walking with my friend Tom from I-group, wearing slacks
and button up shirt, I told him, "I've never tried to sell you on
anything, and I'll never try to sell you on anything again, if you
will just give an honest look at this program."</p>

<p class=dream>We walked to a parking lot near a tennis court, where
Fred's car was waiting.  Drove Fred's car, with the top up, with Tom
and also Robin from my I-group.</p>

<p class=dream>We headed north on FM 249 toward my dad's house, but it
was called 59 South.  I felt confused a bit when this didn't seem to
match up, so we walked a little ways while I made sure we were going
the right way.  We seemed to be, so we got back into the car, and put
the top down,  I tore out of the parking lot, engine all growling its
low roar, zipping down the hill toward the bridge out of Harris
County.</p>

<p class=dream>We were now going south on 249, and a bunch of kids
were walking on the highway, all wearing bathing suits and alternately
chasing, horesplaying, throwing towels, etc.  One towel hit the ground
and was left behind.  Nice big tan fluffy towel, so I told them as we
rolled by slowly so as to not squish any kids.</p>

<p>Tried to go back to sleep, but kept needing to write down the
dream.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>In a shopping mall in France with Fred.  I had walked
away from him and came back to find him haning money to a fat guy who
grabbed it without trying to look conspicuous, except that he had to
reach over to get it.  I asked Fred what was the dealio and he was
all, "dammit $100 for nothing'" as he had apparently been looking at
some new shoes and shit fat cat had told him that he could get Fred
the soes for $100 instead of the price indicated.</p>

<p class=dream>A few minutes later Fred was approached by a cop who
tied his hands behind his back and tied his feet together, and dragged
him, still standing, back to his police office in the mall.  I was
all, "hey that's my brother, where are you going?" etc etc, but the
cop cat wouldn't answer my questions.</p>

<p class=dream>Once we got to the station, he wouldn't even tell me
where I could call to find Fred, nor even if he would stay in the
city, or the country.  (I resisted asking if he would stay in the
world)</p>

<p class=dream>A woman came up to me all, "he probably will," but I
didn't know if she meant he will stay, or he will go, or what.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>Had just arrived at KTRU and Meg as in the station.  I
was the next DJ and I put on some music randomly as per my usual
custom, and then i realized I needed to read the MRA on, so I fumbled
around to find the headphones and the voume dial to keep from getting
feedback, and none of the controls are how I remember them, and I keep
getting feedback until I turrned the headphone volume all the way down
so I can't tell if anyone can hear me or not.  I begin to read the MRA
on from memory, and then I'm looking down at where the MRA on used to
be written and it's not there anymre.  It's a new thing that is not
waht I'm supposed to be reading, and I had to pull up that laminated
pece of paper to find the MRA On, all covered in sawdust and diffiuclt
to read; I pulled up the paper, and sawdust ad gotten all inside the
sealed thing so I had to hold it sidways to make ths awdust shake don
to one side so i could read it and then hold it the other way so I
could read th other half of it.  Just totally unprofessional and
crappy sounding, and I finally got through it and was so mad that I
had sounded like shit that I was going to complain to Will Robidee,
but I woke up first cause I was cold.

<p>Only had on a sheet for covers.  Now I have two quilts as well.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>Someone speaking some dialog for a movie, maybe Sean,
but she was a girl.  We were filming a movie and basically didn't have
enough script so were trying to go over old script again in a
different way to make it seem longer.</p>

<p class=dream>I woke up and Joel was beside me.  He had been sleeping
in a weird position; weirder than Marty McFly in <em>Back to the
Future</em>.  I talked to him a bit, asking him how he slept; he said
just fine, and then he was gone and I was talking to Ricky Shaw, of
Shaw Chevron down in Houston.  He was fine as well and looked forward
to seeing me at my party.</p>

<p>Then I woke up for real.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>In a futuristic setting, needed to travel by getting
inside a tube that would launch me like through a slide (like on
Jetsons or Futurama) except we sometimes had two way traffic in the
same tube and would have to like suck in a gut or try to squish over
to one side to get past.  I didn't always know which side and one time
I went past a guy who had a candle that he was taking to a birthday
party and the candle blew out as we passed each other.</p>

<p class=dream>The candle was like for a wedding or something and I
felt bad for blowing it out before he got it there.  But I found out a
chance to make it up to him, for the Don, the Godfather of his family
was going to walk by a row of people while holding the candle pointing
it toward us and the one person who could light the candle as he
walked by would get his endless gratitude.</p>

<p class=dream>Endless gratitude from the Godfather seemed pretty good
to me, (plus I wanted to make it up to him) so I got a match and lit
it just as he was about to walk past me.  He was a short guy, really
fat, about the size of the dwarf on Twin towers, but looked more like
an Italian cat than a dwarf with huge beard.</p>

<p class=dream>I didn't get the candle lit.  So close I was as I held
my little birthday candle up to his as he walked by, but no luck; my
candle went out just as he arrived.</p>

<p class=dream>I was totally like, "d'oh!!" and *<em>ran</em>* as fast
as I could around the corner to get back to where my table of friends
sat and hollered "does anyone have a lighter?" and two people pulled
lighters out of their pockets and threw them to me as I ran toward
that table and did a quick stop to run back toward the Godfather.  I
didn't exactly catch both lighters in midair, but I did retrive them
both pretty quickly and ran back to the line just as the Godfather was
finishing the line.  He seemed to not be anywhere, but then I saw him
chillin' against a wall, with his big fur vest on and a big pimp
hat.</p>

<p class=dream>I lit both lighters and walked up to him.  I didn't see
the candle, but he smiled as I approached.</p>

<p class=dream>The candle incident seemed to be forgotten, but he
accepted both lighters and mockingly lit a cigar, an air cigar for it
was a pparent there was no cigar.  He lauged at his own little joke.
At least the Godfather was happy.</p>
