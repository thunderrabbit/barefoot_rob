<p>"My name is Takako."</p>

<p>:: "Hi Takako." ::</p>

<p>"I feel _______" (happy, sad, angry, afraid)</p>

<p>:: "You feel ______.  Thank you." ::</p>

<p>:: "Your ______ is important to you.  Thank you." ::</p>

<p>"I love my _____ (because ....)"</p>

<p>:: "You love your _____.  Thank you." ::</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I have heard that it's easier for Japanese to express their
emotions in English than in Japanese.  The above thoughts woke me up
with their significance.</p>

<p>At the meeting there would be Japanese written rules, and before
the meeting would be spoken instructions, <em>Whatever is spoken in
this room, stays in this room</em> and <em>you do not have to speak,
but you are welcome to.</em> The same sort of shit that is spoken
before 12 step meetings.</p>

<p>There would be 'definitions' of the basic emotions:</p>

<pre>
Happy:   :-)

Sad:     :-(

Afraid:  :-O

Angry:  >:-&lt;
</pre>

<p>and possibly Japanese sentences that describe the emotions (if that
can be done).</p>

<p>Today I'm going to have my students discuss what is most important to
them and why.</p>

<p class=dream>Flying between two sections of island over water.  Awe
inspiring view as I made it over the craggly black silouhette of rocks
and trees of the middle mountain ridge thing.  My dad was there to
support me getting across the water of the final section.  I was
flying slowly, not like superman or a jet, but like a cessna.  This
final section of water kept drawing me down and I couldn't stay aloft
over it; ended up in the water before I got to the next bit of land.
Swam to shore.</p>

<p class=dream>Found Amy Leyenberger and her friends having a tea
party in a secluded cave; they wanted to invite just their friends and
it was themed like a pirate movie; she had a purse that had a little
rotating deal that could say 1970 or 1770 or 1970 in a different font
or 1771, or 70 or a skull and crossbones that looked really old.
There was a video of the hours previous that they had been on this
crazy scary amusement park ride that hardly tied them into each seat,
and spun them thousands of feet in the air on this cliff-attached
octopus ride, like The Gunslinger, but not as many swings, and two
person seats and only a single rope loosely tied around their waist
for safety.</p>

<p class=dream>In the restroom, sitting on the john at work when Guy
came in and sat on the throne across from me.  I was surprised that no
divider separated us, but we just talked like it was no big deal,
though I was having a hard time excreting anything, and after just a
ridiculously long time, I used my fingers and realized that my number
2 was lodged up in me sideways and would *never* have come out without
assistance.  After I finished, I went back to where everyone was in a
school type situation, at an assembly at the end of the semester,
after all the dorm residents had cleaned out their rooms so they could
be cleaned / sprayed / etc during the winter break.  I was in the
assembly where some social upheaval had taken place because Buzz
Lightyear was the class favorite, a fact which he had prior knowledge
of, so he didn't sit next to Betty Crocker because he didn't want to
be next to her when the announcement was made.  She was all upset and
all the cameras were watching her reaction and asking her questions
and I really had to poop <em>again</em> so I put on my shoes and ran
over to my coat and backpack, trying to optimize my time so I
distinctly wondered which I should put on first, and finally decided
on coat *then* backpack, and I ran at super high speed alternating
between high speed and low speed but long floating steps down the
hallway and gingerly busted through a door making sure I didn't
destroy a student standing slowly nearby and down the next hall and
outside and about to bust through the gate, but I noticed it was
Locked.</p>

<p class=dream>So I checked the next gate and it was locked and
realized they were all locked because the semester was over and we
weren't supposed to be in the dorms at all, and I wondered how I was
going to go number 2, but I ascended the fence anyway and went up to
the building wondering if it would be unlocked, and it was.  I
carefully walked up the steps and woke up.</p>

<p class=dream>Getting ready to go to gymnastics, I was back at my
dad's house in my old room, but like back there again (now) not in the
past and I had grabbed a soft t-shirt, but it was long sleeved, and I
grabbed a short sleeve shirt that flaired at the bottom but it was all
itchy, so I put on a t-shirt underneath it and then put on the
flair-ey soccer shirt with holes in it and then put on a 'mask' of
plastic fishnet material over my face as a mokc way to hide my face.
There were two Bill Cosby LPs on my reord player and I had left them
out and made a mental note to clean them up some day soon.Right after
I get back from gymnastics maybe.</p>

<p class=dream>With some friends near a UU congregational meeting,
with a discussion about money.  I said, "the current system is that we
ask members to give money to individual congregations, and the
congregations are asked to give money to the UUA in order to be a
member of the UUA.  But the only fair way is to not require individual
members to give money, though we still require the congregation as an
entity to give money to the UUA.  This preserves individual liberties,
but still provides money to the UUA, *if* the UUA and separately, the
congregations provide something worthwhile to their members."</p>

<p>I wouldn't have written down this dream, but I woke up as I was
giving my little speech.</p>

<p class=dream>I had a dream this morning about kissing a woman.  I
didn't know her; just some random hottie on the street and I realized
it was a dream so I pulled her on top of me and we just started
smooching.  I was practically animal gross slobbery kissing her at
first and then I realized that wasn't too sensual, so I slowed it down
a bit and after that we stopped and just sat on the steps wondering
what to do next.</p>

<p>i dunno, what do <em>you</em> want to do?</p>

<p class=dream>I saw a funny commercial on TV about doing whatever it
takes to be successful.  Professional American football game, one
player was running down the field to score and the protagonist of the
commercial saw him, but there were too many players in the way, so he
ran off the field and around the world to plow the offensive guy off
the field just before he made a touchdown.</p>

<p>With all the kangaroos in Japan, of course I'd have a dream about
one.</p>

<p class=dream>A young girl was waalking down a bridge, like a freeway
overpass and listening to a walkie talkie type thing to tell her where
certain people were located.  "There's a young woman walking right;
thereis a young man coming toward you," but it turns out these spoken
words were warning her where not to go, or where to go she came
running back up the bridge and then down beside it and jumped onto a
hospital stretcher next to a kangaroo.  The kangaroo was wwell
natured, and well trained enough to lie flat on his back.  I was
talking to the kangaroo and soon enough he turned and kinda was laying
on his side so I could talk to him moreasily but his huge feet were
kinda in my face and a bit uncomfortable to lie on, but we were joking
around and laughing, but his leg was kinda poking into my stomach, and
it was a combination of funny and painful and he could talk, but
didn't realize or didn't bother to concern himself with how he was
arranged.  So I was chillin' with a kangaroo when I woke up this
morning.</p>

<p class=dream>Went home early.  I did something wrong at work and
they were like that's it you're outta here and I was like whoohoo! but
I wanted to surprise janette so I didn't tell her, but I had to get
home from the airport some way, so I called Fred, or I was going to
ride my bike to his house, but he had to get it from her house first
without telling her he was getting it, nor why if she found out and I
was in my old neighborhood and a dog was yapping so I took off its
lower jaw and started to eat some of the meat (tasted like chicken)
and it was cooked so it wasn't gross and the next dog wanted some so I
fed him some to keep him quiet and the first dog wasn't upset, but was
hungry so I fed him some meat, but not his own jaw cause he wouldn't
be able to chew the bones and then I threw the jaw into the trash, but
realized that they would find it and do DNA analysis on it and know it
was me, so I had to run away and I was climbing over fences in my old
neighborhood but I kept having to come back cause I forgot something
and I finally made it down toward the creek and janette was planning
to go to a skinhead type show out in the woods where they were going
to burn a bunch of machines not like robots but mechanical stuff to
show humans' superiority and I wasn't really interested but I wanted to
see her and maybe there was some benefit from seeing this performance
that I didn't understand yet</p>

<p>And then I woke up and was <em>really</em> relieved to have not
ripped off the dog's jaw, nor have to attend a skinhead
destruct-o-show.</p>

<p class=date>4:48am</p>

<p>Just bought shave cream and woke my body up and hope to sleep with
lucid dreams or better.</p>

<p class=dream>Cory was all, "I had a look at your website, and it's
pretty interesting, your website."</p>

<p class=dream>He pointed at the window, which indicated he had read
what I wrote during OJT.  "Don't kill me."</p>

<p class=dream>"I won't.  You're one of the people I respect a lot
here."</p>
