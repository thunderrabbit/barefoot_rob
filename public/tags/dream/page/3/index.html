<div class="dream">
Arrived at a hedge where I needed to climb up to meet my peps, but two
people were waiting to come down, so I invited them to come down first
before I climbed.  I wasn't sure how they had been standing on the top
of the bushy trees, but after I climbed up using a horizontal branch
fork to press up and climb up from there, I found the top of the
bushes had been covered in a raft of logs.  Very convenient!  There
were some kids playing in the next zone of toys and Fred was there so
I joined them and kicked a ball into the fray and hit a kid in the
face.  He was like "wha?" and didn't cry when he saw me apologized for
it.  We played dodge ball soccer and the ultimate team wa playing real
soccer next door, laughing at me when I couldn't kick the ball
properly.  I basically ignored them and focused on playing.  Fred and
I were playing against three other players, using a few different
balls.  The other players had a home made lighter-air pump and they
used that to inflate the balls.  The bigger kid came over and
explained that's what it was in case anyone ame over asking questions,
because it apparenly looked suspicious.  Balls inflated quickly and
the kid jumped on the last ball to finish its inflation.  I heard a
popping noise and thought he had burst the ball, but it was inflated
so hmm I guess not.

<p class="dream">In my men's group, we were asked to organize some
images based on how important they were to us, and it was supposed to
give some insights on our character.  When it was my turn to do it,
only a few of the cards have images.  I kept looking at them and
trying to figure out what was wrong.  The people asked me and I said
"this is a dream so the cards have changed" but I didn't wake up or
otherwise become lucid.</p>

<p class="lucid">I knew i was able to fly, and determined that I would beat the effects
of gravity, I tried various things to lift off the ground.  Then I
found that looking up allowed me to fly up; this
was great!  I was able to control my flight, even able to fly around in a small
space.  I was able to break through some walls repeatedly, and finally
the roof opened up for me.</p>

<p>I hadn&rsquo;t previously been able to fly so close to the
ground without being attracted to it.</p>

<p class="lucid">I didn't really go anywhere <i>per se</i> but I flew
along the highway for a bit.</p>

<hr />

<p class="dream">In a room near the kitchen, teaching a lesson, I came
back in to the kitchen and found Kevin's phone was on the counter,
still connected. I remembered I had called him accidentally but it
must not have hung up.  I picked it up all "hello" and he immediately
goes "hello!  Who's been listening to my conversations?"</p>

<p class="dream">"No one! I called you by mistake a while ago. I was
in the other room teaching a lesson."</p>

<p class="dream">He goes, "hmm"</p>

<p class="dream">I didn't know what else to say, but realizing it was
a dream, I just woke up.</p>

<p class="dream">
There was some graffitti painted on the gate near the spies camp
inside the castle, something ke "The downfalll of W will be from the
camp of R on the inside", where W and R were the initials of the
family names involved.  I can't recall if R or W was the good guys,
but I was in favor of the good guys and we noticed that one man had
gone missing, and realized that he must have been converted to the bad
side, so I went off to find him and protect his girlfriend who loved
him but didn't know he would kill her.  I arrived at their compound
and read the graffiti then saw the girl standing outside.  I urged
her to run with me, but she was paralyzed with fear until he leveled a
crossbow toward her heart, and  I  took her hand as I ran away.  The
crossbolt didn't hurt us, and I put her inside my jacket for safe
keeping, and hid in a room when I heard some people nearby.  One of
them came into the room looking for a place to pee, and took a whiz
all over the floor in the room, but didn't notice me in the corner.
All of them came in, horsing around, and I wodered if I would (have
to) kill them as one of the flipped on the lights and I simply walked
away, hoping they would think I was a ghost or something.  They saw me
and were confused for long enough that I was able to jump out through
a window on the far side of the room.  I ran around a corner and jumped
up toward the celing where I was able to see the tops of the walls as
if the ceiling had been removed.  I thought that would be useful to
walk across them to escape"

<p>and I woke up</p>

<p class="dream">I bought a neat game and asked Lin if she'd like to
play.  She was like, "I don't like games" or something and I got
pissed off like "you haven't even seen what game I'm talking about!"
and I got it out to start playing with it, but couldn't find it in my
backpack due to all the other crap that was in there, including a
cooler full of watermelon and spinach which had apparently gone bad
because I didn't remember having put it in there, and some bread type
sweets, so I started throwing all of them out of my bag, and noticed I
couldn't really stop though I knew it was infantile, and lots of
people were nearby so I wasn't making a very good example of emotional
awareness.</p>

<p class="dream">
Fred came to Japan  and I helped him unload his car while teling him
about the things I had been thinking about which included how to make
some computer programs, or wondering how to make some computer
programs to do some type of calculations.  Like how to write news
article titles based on news articles; we'd have a function
`title.txt()` for the  article thatwould calculate the article
</p>

<p class="dream">
We went into the house and Fred realized that he had left his car
unlocked and I was like, "I'll go lock it, and then he realized he can
just beep it from here because it was not too far outide the bedroom
winodw.  He locked it, and it unlocked.  Oh he had locked it, so he
beeped it again and locked it.
</p>

<p class="dream">
Then he unlocked it and said watch.  If I don't come with proxxximity
of the car, it will relock itself.  It took a while and I started to
get sleepy so I got, just relock it I'm falling asleep, but I get the
idea.
</p>

<p>At this piont I kinda woke up because I realized I was dreaming.</p>

<p class="dream">
In a vaguey lucid state, there were some tough guys in front of the
conveni when we went to go inside, but I wasn't worried because I knew
it was a dream, and one of them dropped their cell phone as the other
handed it to him and I saw a cell phone commercial on the billbord and
they graphically showed the guys of the phone being swapped for a
different body, and I was like, "ah; I want that" so I kept watching
until the brand / maker was displayed and then they showed it being
used inside a shoe a la Get Smart, and a guy used the shoe phone and
sudently got a phone call from the Get Smart actor who said he called
because he was excited to promote the in-shoe phone technology.
</p>

<p class="dream">
I wondered how long he'd be calling people and wouldn't the
converaations get pretty boring so I better think of something
intersting to say when he called me after I bougth the phone.

<p class="dream">Making a copy of Tariq's data, I noted a pattern of full backups and
partial backups, so I was able to go back a week to get the most
recent full backup.  The current backup was going to be a full backup,
but it was aborted before it finished.
</p>

<p class="dream">Later, he and I were walking to the train station, and after I crossed
the street, I was like, "hey Tariq over here!" and he turned to follow
and was suddenly hit by a car like blam and instantly dead =
dismembered into blobs of white fat and two wooden egg shapes which
had been his eyes.</p>

<p class="dream">I had a sense that it couldn't be real, but didn't wake up. I was
shocked, and I feared it was my fault, as I had called to him, and he
was killed when he turned to follow me.  Riding in his dad's car, I
called Lin and told her "Tariq is dead!" and also wanted his dad to
understand, so I switched to Japanese "Tariq が死んだ!" and he took
notice and we drove to the location where there was a police vehicle
nearby so we directed him to the scene where some people were picking
up the blobs of fat.  I was too distraught to do anything.
</p>

<p class="dream">
Walking with some people in a new neighborhood, I realized they looked
like gang members, featuring big tattoos, spikey hair, knuckles,
jackets.  I spoke to the toughest looking one and said, "to be honest,
I feel a bit of fear around you guys, even though I know you're just a
bunch of guys.. Your outward appearance reminds me of some stories
I've heard about gang violence."
</p>

<p class="dream">
They were like, "well why don't you come with us?" and more fear came
up in me as they took me into a room.  I realized I was dreaming, but
didn't come fully out of it until I stated the intention that only
good things will happen in my dreams.
</p>

<p>And I woke up out of the dream</p>

On a bus with lots of people including two people who were co-workers.
One was a reporter who had been standing all day.  She said to the
other as she got off the bus that her feet hurt and she really wanted
a foot massages.  After she got off the bus, I asked him if I could
have her phone number to give her a massage.

He was like, "no" and left it at that because it was the expected
answer.

Then I go, "well, can I teach you how to give foot massage?"

He goes, "no; I don't have time for that."

After a while, he said, "let me give you some feedback."

I said "okay, I'm turning off my pone" as I turned off my phone; I
legitimately wante to hear it.

He said, "you're bugging me at work about massage when I have to work."

And I go okay, "I undersand you're busy, and I be you don't want to
learn how to give foot massage."

He goes, "no; I said I don't have time for it.."  He goes, "okay join
me for a reiki, shaanism, massage, I-group, programming, painting,
electron, barbershop, chromosome, motorized robotics, public speaking
class."

I go "okay,  When is it?"

He goes, "you have to teach it."

"Well, you said join before.  Anyway I don't know all those things so I
cannot teach them all; your scenario isn't analagous to mine, but I get
your essential point; You aren't interested in learning foot massage
to give to her."

<p class="dream">
Living inside a QT movie, therewas a spooky scene and then a couple
guys were walking along the beach with the task of digging up a dead
body.  One of them goes, "okay start digging, and the other was like
where? and then the first one fell down a bit of a cliff and revealed
her corpse, and  he goes, "right there" so they dug her out and she
was actually still alive, though animated with  spooky spirit ghost or
something and the card overlay said "Despite her looking like a nyph,
this scene is quite scary"
</p>

<p class="dream">
So while watching, I was prepared to turn it off or walk away, but it
never got scary too much.   There were two undead women teaching me how
to fight and they didn't rip my face off or anything and I was
thankful for that.  In fact, they seemed helpful and nurturing.  I
felt a bit relaxed as we had a big sparring thing and then as we
relaxed I saw a clock count down a random series of digits and then
reach the end.  I go, "what's that??" and was a bit afraid again.  One
of the women said she didn't know, and then we saw a bunch of bats
flying to surround our glass building.
</p>

<p class="dream">
Uh oh.  We coudl see them all smoofing around outside, so we turned
off the light inside but I recalled that bats could see infrared and
therefore our heat signatures.  So we turned off the light and then
could see that some of them were inside anyway, and the two girls who
had helped me sacrificed themselves to attack the bats, but it wasn't
enough as there were thousands of bats, so I tried to tattack them a
bit, but bailed due to ineffectiveness.
</p>

<p class="dream">
One of the well dressed vampire bat men with slick backed blonde hair
bit my finger with a smile as I flew in to kill him.  I realized it
was fruitless so I bailed to a new scene in which I was in San
Francisco back in the day when it was stil active Alcatraz.  We looked
out at the island, but there were lots of islands in between and I was
sure I could get out to it, or a way from it..  A three times retired
army general (served for 60 years) said he would swim out there with
me.  He jumped straight down over concrete right next to teh ocean and
sdove feet first directly down into the water just inces from the
concrete.  I saw him in the deep water, propelling himself forward
with just his feet kicking as his arms trailed back.  He made god time
and I jumped forward so as to not be so close to the concrete.  I
wasn't straight as I hit the water and so didn't go very deep into it
There were some other boats in hthe waster of some people bothering
us, and he suggested we go over to a room blocked by a grinder that
was stopped so he went past it, and then I saw him (now  little kid) on
the other side as the wheel was starting again.  He had been giving a
piece of paper to take back through the tube and I willed the grinder
to not move so he'd be okay.  Then some other people tried to come
through, starting with an old man, but I couldn't control the grinder
as it started to move so I woke up.

<h2 id="09-13-friday-24-july-2015-jst">09:13 Friday 24 July 2015 JST</h2>

<p>Was on the train next to a cute girl with braces, and I started
talking to her by saying, &ldquo;I like your braces.&rdquo;  She smiled and we
talked a bit and determined we were both going the same directions on
the Tokaido Line, though she was going farther than me.  We arrived at
a station where we needed to change trains, and I went down the left
side of the train to get seats for us, but the train doors were
closed.  I had to go back to the back of the train to get to the other
side, but by then all the seats had been taken.  I found the girl; she
was lying down near the front of the train, but there was no way I
could easily sit next to her with all the crowd of peole and boxes.  I
considerd sitting on top of the train, but knew I&rsquo;d be easily spotted
and didn&rsquo;t imagine I&rsquo;d be allowed to do that.  Then I found an open
are near the front of the train, and squeezed myself into it.  I heard
two women speaking about a date one of their friends had had.  One
woman asked her friend how his (the mutual friend&rsquo;s) date had gone and
she replied that it ws good, though he had lied about something, and
she didn&rsquo;t mind.  Basically she wanted a chance at him as well.  The
other said, &ldquo;okay, I won&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that point, they saw me behind them, and I was like, &ldquo;HI.  I won&rsquo;t
tell,&rdquo; referring to the quote from before, and they laughed and
agreed. I could see out the front of the train as we started, and
there were some poeple firing laser rifles at the train, and some
people on our side shooting some laser rifles back to clear a
path for the train.  A bicycle had ben destroyed and its metal tubes
were causing havoc for the train wheels, but we got past it somehow.
As we went up and over the hill it was apparent that we had more
momentum than the laser rifle guys could stop so they left us go past,
but not before they had put some more bicycles in the  path.</p>

<p>I saw two bicyles on either side of a foot path that we were about to
use to go up the mountain, so I reached out of the train and grabbed
them and tossed them to either side as we rushed through. That saved
us from a lot of damage so I was glad to not have to think about what
might have happened.</p>

<p>We got to the top of a valley and there was a station at which some
people were playing a video game live action to determine the winner
as others were making bets on who the winner would be.  I had never
seen the game before, but it was my turn to play.</p>

<p>I was standing on a thin post and facing an opponent about 20 feet
away.  We each had a small inventory of weapons and abilities, but I
knew none of them, so I just started randomly firing things until I
won the level.</p>

<p>I won it quickly, so the AI switched to the boss level next, and I
employed the same strategy, and amazingly won the level.  The crowd
went wild!  They started to call me The Magician, because even the
seasoned players couldn&rsquo;t win the level so quickly.  They asked how I
had done it, and I said it was all through intention.  &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know
what to do so I said a little prayer internally: &lsquo;I will win&rsquo; and
then just slapped at the handles randomly until I won.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was invited by the owner of the inn to come upstairs to her living
space, and she showed me some of her family history and how they had
come to own the place (basically through longevity).</p>
