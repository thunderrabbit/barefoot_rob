<p class=dream>"It's a charley barley barely burger"</p>

<p class=dream>My friends and I had through it would be fun to ride on
the back of the truck as our boss was driving to Tennessee or
someplace hopefully not so far away.  The truck had started out as
trains and we were testing our train boarding skills.  I had been able
to barely climb up the slick stainless steel outer casing of the
train, but somehow I did it.  I held on for a while, but it became
apparent I wouldn't be able to do this the whole time.</p>

<p class=dream>So we opened the doors more and I climbed in with my
friends onto the futons and other soft things loaded into the back of
the truck.  The back doors swung open and some of our stuff fell off.
I was all, "oh shit our stuff is falling off!" and I jumped off to go
rescue it.  Like a couple sleeping bags, and a purse (although who
needs sleeping bags with so many futons?)</p>

<p class=dream>The truck was driving quite slowly, though I didn't
know how much longer it would be driving so slowly.  I ran away from
the truck, grabbing two sleeping bags, and tossed one up.  It almost
made it through the small gap between the futons and the edge of the
door.  I tried again and made it.  I tossed the other bag up as well,
and then ran further away from the truck to recover my friend's
purse.</p>

<p class=dream>I had a distinct feeling that our boss driving the
truck would be able to see me in the rearview mirrors since I had run
so far back behind the truck.</p>

<p class=dream>Grabbed her purse anyway and ran back toward the truck.
But the truck turned toward the left, making me clearly visible in the
mirrors, so I dropped down prone on the floor to make myself less
visible.  He turned right (back away from me again) and I thought I
was okay.  But then I realized he was just swinging around to U
turn.</p>

<p class=dream>I was caught.  I lay on the ground with my friend's
purse and another bag as the huge 18 wheeler drove slowly toward me.
At this point, the game was up; I didn't try to hide what I had been
doing, nor try to implicate my friends; maybe they could still get
away.</p>

<p class=dream>I ended up at the main office, with no way to get home,
but I had called my dad for help.  After a while a woman came in.</p>

<p class=dream>"Rob?  This is from your dad [to help you get home]."
She held three items: bag of cookies, stack of bologna, stack of white
bread; she placed them down one at a time on the table beside me.  "He
said to tell you it's a 'Charley,' 'barley,' 'barely burger'"</p>

<p class=dream>Good pun there, dad.  Not.</p>

<p class=dream>Riding around with Ryan McCarthy in his little car, we
were reminiscing about old times living and playing at the Bibby's
house.  About making toy paper B-52 bombers of various sizes, and
sometimes making two in a row cause all we had was time to do anything
we wanted.  "Oh and remember that one where we added all the extra
plastic and gum and shit on it?  It was so loaded down it was huge -
it could fly about this fast" I showed him by moving my hand as
through molasses.  "Yeah it was like a Logan" and I'm like "???  She
was not a big girl. She was tall but not big."</p>

<p class=dream>And we were way up in this telephone pole type thing
after having parked near a favorite food store of his.  Some stools
were slightly in the way in the street below us, like little 1 foot
tall bar stools.  We were yammering and laughing and a car below was
all wanting to get through, and had plenty of room, but was being all
cautious and stuff.  We waved this person on through and she got
through but the next car was just as slow and finally made it through.
The next car with an asian woman driving and her asian friend and two
poodles in the car was driving quite aggressively right on the bumper
of the second car and when the second car got through the asian driver
started knocking over the stools like in a pissed off manner, then
turned into the parking lot and ripped around the circle and back to
the stools and crashed through more of them more aggressively this
time.  She parked all askew in front of someone's house and got out
all normal like, "will our car be okay there?"</p>

<p class=dream>It was Catherine Nguyen, but she didn't recognize
me.</p>

<p class=dream>"Um, we don't own that property; we can't give you
permission to park there."</p>

<p class=dream>"Well where did you park?"</p>

<p class=dream>We told her and then she looked snootily over at the
idea of moving her car somewhere.</p>

<p class=dream>"But you'll watch it won't you?"</p>

<p class=dream>"We're just about to leave, but good luck."</p>

<p class=dream>"You know what, fuck 'em," referring to the owner of
the property in front of which she had parked.</p>

<p class=dream>"Yeah, that's just like what the Russians said," said
Ryan, making some political reference that I didn't get.</p>

<p class=dream>She got it and laughed, "Oh haha I bet you're a real
jerk."</p>

<p class=dream>"I'm as good as they come," he retorted.</p>

<p class=dream>And I'm thinking '<em>dammn how can they practically
seem to like each other by being so viscious?<em>' but I knew it was
all somehow a game they were playing.</p>

<p class=dream>She and her friend walked away and Ryan and I climbed
down to make good on our promise to leave and not watch her car.  I
kept thinking to myself, "man that girl is hot."</p>

<p class=dream>Then I was like, "oh shit I wonder if I'm late?" and we
checked the clock which kept calculating the time like a scale when
someone first steps on it and the wheel goes back and forth as it
centers on the weight.  It never got past 8pm.  So I figured I was
okay, but then I slowly realized I was dreaming and Matty would have
woken me up anyway.  Whew.</p>

<p class=dream>In a small section of town like an amusement park with
Ma and Jon leading the way to a restaurant that they thought was
closed but was just under cleaning aor it was being built and was
really expensive but I peeked my head in the door and saw a room with
green short carpet and a partition behind which people were cleaning
the carpet and the hostess was at the other end of the room and
motioned for me to follow her, so I walked past the partiition and to
the other end of the room and outside after assuring Ma and Jon they
should come with me and they did and I reached the outside area and
the hostess had gone down some old steps of varying heights and not
supersturdy and I daintily skipped down them and then warned my mom
they were different heights so she should be careful and they got down
the steps and the hostess showed us to an outdoor table like a picnic
table big wooden kind and asked who would be paying for the bill and I
didn't say anything cause I had no money and had assumed my mom or Jon
could pay for me, and then the busboy had joined us and he said he
would pay for Jon and my mom could pay for me and everyone agreed that
was a good idea it seemed, and the hostess was describing something
and then she left and Jon was all quiet and like, "no one listens to
me" even though he hadn't said antyhthing and I'm all listening very
intently to him even though I don't understand why he woudlnt speak up
in the first place and he was all, "In dreams I just get so emotional;
My emotions come right out and I can't control them expecially
sadness" and he was going to cry and then I walked out of the
restaurant and could see a wheelbarrow full of bottles of Pace Picante
sauce and employees were taking them out of the wheel barrow and it
turned out the restaurant was not opening or cleaning, but closing and
closing right out from underneath us without them saying anything.</p>

<p class=dream>Walking down a parking lot with my friends behind me
and one friend was in front of me so I was like, "okay turn here" but
she wasn't listening until the very last driveway so I was like "okay
be sure to turn here" and she did turn right into the driveway though
it was partially blocked by traffic cones, we walked over the bridge
and I was in a locker room walking with Arnold Shwarzenegger and saw
some graffitti about someone having a lot of money like 218 million
dollars and I commented to him like, "hey and you probably do have 218
million dollars.."  and I was careful not to just follow him around,
but let ol' Arnold do his own thing and I selected my favorite locker
in the room and then went to get clothes, going out of my one room and
turning left and My locker was number 2, way down second from the
bottom row and it was the one I had always selected in this locker
room, which was part of an amusement park and it was slightly opened
but that was okay because people used these lockers all the time.</p>

<p class=dream>Then I was slecting clothes from baskets of clothes
that had just been dried, wondering about the guy who had to sort them
all, heaping baskets of shorts and underwerar and tshirts.  did he
sort them by size, or just type? </p>

<p class=dream>Leaving Dallas I noticed that each time previously that
I had gone through Dallas I had used the surface streets which gave me
a different perspective of the city, with a different viewpoint now
that I was familiar with its highways and such.  I tried to place them
in my mind, to fit the pieces together of how these surface streets
fit underneath the highways that I was seeing, and I couldn't see in
my mind how it all fit together.</p>

<p class=dream>there was one big elevated roadway like Pierce Elevated
in Houston and I was looking up at it from below, but couldn't
remember having ever driving on that highway in Dallas.</p>

<br>I like the part about the Highways. It is very odd when you drive a section of freeway that you usually go under, or vicversa. I&rsquo;ve been tolds that most modren skyscrapers are disigned to be viewed from the highway vooming by at 70 mph as appose to the old ones which are disigned to be viewed from street level.<br>

<p class=dream>Riding my bike with Janette riding hers on some back
country roads somewhere, looking for places to go camping.  We ended
up doing a U-turn or something interestng like that.</p>

<p class=dream>Got back to the city ando Janette and I were walking
our bikes up the median of I-10; we had reached I-10 and I-20 almost
and she was asking me "is that I-10?"  "no that's the feeder for I-10"
and then we got to the actual I-10 and were walking our bikes up the
middle between the lanes of traffic and a motorcycle came zipping by
us sharing our same lane and then another motorccle came zipping by us
sharig our land going the other direction.</p>

<p class=dream>Then I was all "look behind us and tell me when there's
a break in traffic (so we could go across)" and she didn't hear me at
first and I saw the traffic slow down ahead of us and then beside us
and surmised that she didn't hear me because tehre must be a break in
traffic by now, so I told her again and somemotrocycles were beside us
and she goes, "oh now e can cross" and we crossed the highway all 4
lanes or so walking our bikes across then rode on the shoulder and
then stopped for a second and gazed out over some flooded areas
watchin people play and drive around in the flood.  Westopped for too
long though and got caught almost by a guy driving an official state
traffic truck and the truck coasted to a stop in front of us to nab us
and I was all "fuck that" and we were both on one bike and thought it
was more dangerous to go down this way (wit h my glove partway off) I
zipped down crossing all the lanes of traffic to the middle of the
highway and thecrossed them all again (to be very confusing) and got
to the bottom of the hill.  Didn't wreck.  Got away.</p>

<p class=dream>The guy came walking down the freeway ufreeway like
where peple can sleep under the overpas and he told us how dangerous
it was to do what I just did blah blah blah and he turned to leave,
waling up the ramp and <em>CONK</em>ed his head on the top of the
overpass though I had shouted "watch your head!!!"nderneath the </p>

<p>(haha I should have said Check your head!!)</p>

<p class=dream>And then I thought he must have been joking after what
he had just been bawling me out and the jerke back, hit his head
*again* and then fell and hit his head again on the ground.  Oh
jeeze.</p>

<p class=dream>So I jumped on my bike and drove away all crazy looking
for ice and found that I shouldn't go back up the freeway, but instead
went down the ramp into a hall andgot a locker basket of ice and a pan
of smaller crushed ice and then went up to him and put his head in the
locker basket of ice, and used the smalle shaved ice to fill in the
gaps and give him a full ice covering.</p>

<p class=dream>I really felt compassion for the enemy here, wanting to
o the right thing for him even though just 30 minutes earlier he would
have arrested me for plaiing on the bridge, but tha was just our
roles,; he was still a person and I still loved him.  I covered him in
sand so he wouldn't slide down the hill, but then he woke up and his
mom Julie Sexton came down and his siter (not Claire, but Carina
Dormio) and I told them waht happened and they ooh and ahhed over the
cut and wondered if he should get stitches and his beeper went off,
but it was my alarm.</p>

<p class=dream>Mark Leonard was there when I got a job in sales for a
software company and he immediately helped me with some advice that
was wisdom in his mind that I simply didn't have (or actually do cause
it was my dream) he was all, "now what you could do is have some guys
run around and get people to fill out questionaires to prequalify
customers for the software.  Pay these guys maybe per page they turn
back in."</p>

<p class=dream>I was all "should I pay them a dollar per page
(name)?"</p>

<p class=dream>"I wouldn't even pay them that much."</p>

<p class=dream>And it's like bam that was a perfect little plan to
help.  I hadn't even gotten business cards yet.</p>

<p class=dream>Then a guy drove up in a van and was lost.  He showed
me on a map where he intended to go, and apparently got confused with
the opposite-ness of highway 59.</p>

<p class=dream>I showed him where on the map he was, drew out a
correct simplified map of how to get back where he wanted to go,
taking into consideration construction concerns and all that, and oh
and he spoke only Spanish so I was crossing a language barrier as well
and I was really able to help this guy out.  His wife and son were in
the van anxious to go, but me and this guy were really connecting and
it was great.</p>

<p class=dream>They left for a second and he was playing a CD for me
and they came back and I was all, "here they are you gotta go" and he
didn't want to go, but did.  I gave him my adventure card.</p>

<p>The point as I see it from these dreams is that I am better suited
for some jobs (giving directions) than other jobs (sales).</p>

<p class=dream>I was at a UU conference including adults and youth
like GA or SWUUSI and sitting with the youth and my mom came in,
looking to me like Julia Roberts.  I asked Kate Robinson "doesn't she
look like Julia Roberts?"</p>

<p class=dream>"A little bit"</p>

<p class=dream>But no she really did look like her and then she was
looking around (my mom was looking around) and she found me and said
HI then saw some of her friends were crying and my mom started crying
and I knew immediately that meant we had started to bomb Iraq.</p>

<p class=dream>I ran outside the conference center and started
screaming until my throat was raw "GODDAMMIT MOTHERFUCKING GEORGE
DOUBLE YOU BUSH I TOLD YOU TO NOT FUCKING BOMB IRAQ!! YOU ARE SUCH A
FUCKING MORONIC MOTHERFUCKING POMPOUS ASSHOLE OF THE HIGHEST DEGREE
AND I WANT YOU TO STOP THIS WAR <em>RIGHT NOW</em>"</p>

<p class=dream>And my throat was so raw that nothing but squeaks were
coming out and I keep thinking about Ginnie's hunger strike on the
steps of the Texas state capitol.  I wonder if I could do that at the
white house?  It's fucking snowing like a bitch up there apparently;
I'd have to make it a clothing strike as well or get some clothes.</p>

<p class=dream>at dad and karen's house, and helping them put some
glass doors back into place which were supposed to be laying on some
metal rack thing but the rack was bent or something and the doors were
not laying just the way they should so I was trying to line them up
properly and a couple YRUUers showed up to help and they were all
putting some roof pieces on the doors but were doing it from top to
bottom which wasn't going to work so I got mad and left, or I told
them it was the wrong way and I wasn't going to wait around cause I
had already been working for a long time on it.</p>

<p class=dream>It was Tanner and Scottie with the roof tile things</p>

<p class=dream>I left and ended up walking into church where I didn't
want to be but didn't want to be rude and walk out so I stayed and it
was extremely unprofessional with people answering the phone during
the service nad the preacher referring to personal business of his own
as the daughter wanted to get a new car and was interrupting church or
something. and the church started singing Morning has Broken, which is
one of my favorite hymns so it coudln't be all that bad and they took
the offering and I drpped a dollar into the thing and then the next
usher had his hand out and it was ful of nice rocks, so I gave him a
nice rock out of my pocket.  it took a while to get my hand out of the
pocket cause it was tight.</p>

<p class=dream>I left church and was talking to some woman who thought
my son(!) was teaching english in Japn so I went with it and just led
her on as we were on the train going past buildings and such in tokyo
and I got off at a Shell station apartment building and tried to get
into the parking lot levels where cars were, basically just testing the
security of the building where I was supposed to be, but they didn't
know who I was yet, so I tried getting through different doors and got
through some but was never able to get anywhere that I could actually
reach a car or anything important, as I worked my way down the steps to
different levels.  got tot he ver bottom llevel and the cop was there
looing at me so I chose not to go back up and try again, but went out
frnto where there was a atter fountain and was walking along it and
found myself in the old west, with a bunch of guys, all mysogynists it
seemed who were living on a piece of landin the middle of the modern
world, but there idea of fun was to get catle across a big river, just
like in the old cattle drives aross the midwest.  some cattle had big
horns and some cattle each had one big horn sticing straight up, alike
a big phat horn fat like about 9 or 10 inhes in diameter, but kinda
square like the cows head and stiking straight up and arching
backwards.</p>

<p class=dream>The guys were all on horses and walking along the water
and then it was time to jump on the horses and go acrross so I got on
my horse bareback, though I had a saddlenorn around whcih I wrapped my
rope nad they kinda laughted at me cause the saddle norn was so
small, but they wrespected me since I was the new guy and just trying
to get into the middle of this whole thing</p>

<p class=dream>They were laughing about women's undergarments that had
been left on these railroad cars on the side of shore, and thewer serw
these were all panites and bras of these guys girlfriends or some
eomwon who were there now and I grabbed w Wende's panties and kept
them safe though I never saw Wende; I intenede to bring themb ack to
her once the rie was done. and some guys jokingly threw panties into
the river and laughted watching them go downstream.  I chose not to
recover all the panties since they might laught, and I didn't know
whose thery were anyway, but just watched them go dwonstream and
wondered abut hte karma between these men and their significant
other.s.  Then some woman pushed a bra into the river and then someone
put two small white shoes on two stacked purple pillows and pushed
those down the river.  The pillows came apart as tethey whoosed downt
he first waterslide like waterfall and one of the soes stayed on the
top pillowa dn the other shoe came off altogether and the wind was so
strong tha tthe shoe got bblown back up the waterfall and off the
river into the ocean a bit; the river was going paprallelto shore and
somhow they were staying distinct and the show breached the ga p
between river and ocean and then go blown back across nto the river
and tried to go down the waterfal again.</p>

<p class=dream>All this time I kept wende's panties stuck under my
crotch, jsust sitting on them so they'd stay safe from pranksters and
and safe from falling iinto the waater.  I got off my horse and some
tall guy who reminded me of Ivory from the wolf shop came up and
startied tauntingly pushing a phat blunt (lllit phat blunt into my
face all "i heard you dont' smoke the good stuff; try it" and I
knocked it out of his ahands and into the water and he cgot all mad
and I stood my groud, "I know that they must hav told you how I feel
about that, that's why I acted so aggressively cause you were pushing
it into my face taunthingly and I didn't appreciate it.  I appreciate
you respecting my dchoisess.  choice in this case."  and he did
respect my choice and e hugged and it was alll good.</p>

<p class=date>1:29am</p></p>

<p>This dream happened about 4am:</p>

<p class=dream>Inside a shopping mall, there was a display of slices
of cake, about 8 HUGE pieces like 18 inches tall and at least as long
and wide, solid chocolate cake with about 2 inches of icing on top.
The mall was just closing, so I helped some of the security guards
there pick up the cake; they were going to take it home - no use in
wasting good cake!</p>

<p class=dream>One of the pieces I stacked onto my wagon thing was
shaped like Texas.  It wasn't as thick as the others, but still novel
for its shape.</p>

<p class=dream>Having pulled the wagon of cake outside, I put it onto
their boat (small yacht) and then I saw Danielle Bartley running into
the mall looking for her dog!  I found her dog outside, a small
doberman, but she came out with a little black Benji.  I said HI to
her and stuff, but she couldn't give me her phone number or
anything.</p>

<p class=dream>She wanted to drive my car, a kickin black Ferrari and
I let her cause I figure hey, it's just a car.  We couldn't get the
garage door opener to work to get out of the parking garage but she
knew a back way to get out and drove backwards to get out of the
garage.  We ended up in a place near her house and equally near where
I wanted to go so we left the car there and each walked home.</p>

<p class=dream>With two cute girl-friends of mine, one new and one
kinda old, and I was trying to decipher the meaning of the screenname
of the newer girlfriend.  It was like ah-pl8-gr8 or something and I
kept trying to attach English words to it like English, but she gaave
me a hint that it was Spanish, and that changed the whole paradigm, of
course. (thanks g).</p>

<p class=dream>And it turned out to be something like aloha hombres,
piscica amore something something yadda yadda but I couldn't quite get
it and both girls were like patronizing and the old girlfriend was
getting frustrated like that I couldn't get something and I was
getting *really* frustrated and embarassed and wouldn't even make eye
contact with the old girlfriend anymore, just trying to ignore her
comments and finally I was all, "I'm sorry, I've got to go." and
grabbed my shoes and jumped off the roof to the ground and they were
all, "wait don't give up" and I turned around and just started to
SCREAM yell "One of my shortcomings is that I'm can't memorize little
tiny few FUCKING WORDS AND I'M REALLY FUCKING SCARED THAT I WON'T BE
ABLE TO LEARN LANGUAGES AT ALL AND IT'S NOT FUCKING FAIR AND" and they
got scared and both of them walked away from me and I was like pissed
that they wouldn't listen and like wtf, do they thinnk I would hurt
them?  Obviously they've never been to my I-group to know and trust
that I can be mad at myself and express it through yelling and not
hurt another person.</p>

<p>When I woke up and realized it was a dream, I knew what must have
been part of the problem in memorizing the phrase: the letters kept
changing since they were dream letters and not actually a screenname
in reality.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>previous dream:</p>

<p class=dream>TIME Magazine had a party in their offices and wanted
to invite the general public, but they didn't advertise the party in
their magazine.  The only way people could have known about it is by
knowing one of the staff members.  They were having a meeting trying
to discuss the success of the party and talking some inane BS like,
"oh we should offer things the public will like" and whatever, but no
one hit on "we should <em>advertise</em> the party," so I raised my
hand to tell them that, but then for some reason didn't tell them
(either the dream ended, or I figured they wouldn't listen and I
didn't care enough to tell them)</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>previous dream.</p>

<p class=dream>A TIME Magazine article on how a woman "used a
newsgroup message and a binary editor to change her web browser to
self modifying code."  and the search engine used the browser and
replicants of the browser to do a faster search, and to actually
better itself in some way.  And people weren't impressed or didn't
understand the significance of self modifying code; this was the
beginning of computers writing their own code, when suddenly the
humans would begin to lose track and lose ability to understand the
code for the computers won't have to document the code, nor even write
in a high level language.  But no one understood these types of
implications, and were just caught up in the apparent triviality of
the search which google could do already.  "wah wah wah google already
does what this new search engine does."  but that wasn't the
point.</p>

<p>This dream was probably around 4 or 5 am, before the first rooster
started hollerin'.</p>

<p class=dream>I was chatting with Angelique from back in my UH days
at the dorms.  We were being all flirtatious and may have been about
to hook up or go on our first date when she said something like, "well
we can date if you don't mind sometimes ending up in the restroom in
Paris in a puddle of vomit" or something equally unattractive.</p>

<p class=dream>I was like, "ummmm well I guess we can't date cause I
won't be interested in anything like that."</p>

<p class=dream>And we had a brief period of mourning realization that
we had just broken up before we even got together and we both felt
sad.  I said like, "well we are both still good people, and your
choice is your choice and mine is my choice," or some wisdom and such
but we still both felt sad and I was crying.</p>

<p class=dream>Then she was all, "hey I want you to meet this guy," as
a man was walking using a cane very slowly across the street to her
parents house.  "He's the author of a book" etc and she thought maybe
he could help me do something interesting in my life.</p>

<p class=dream>So she introduced us and he no longer had a cane and I
cleared up my apparent sadness and I was all, "HI, I'm Rob Nugen and
I'm going to Japan in March.  I heard that you're an author, and I
wonder if you'd be interested in coming to present something on your
book."</p>

<p class=dream>But it turned out the book was on social economics of
the 15th century or something equally too detailed for beginning
English readers so we decided it probably wouldn't be worthwhile.</p>
