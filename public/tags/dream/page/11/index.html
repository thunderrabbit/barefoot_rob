<p class=dream>During Thanksgiving Holiday, Mark Holt was cooking a
tremendous meal,but he added some kind of rubber to the nodles, like
he cooked in some fishing lure rubber to see what would happen.  The
result was less than optimal; he had to cook some new noodles because
the rubber melted and mage a huge mess of the original noodles.</p>

<p class=dream>My dad drove Fred and I to New York to meet up one of
Fred's friends that dad and I had never met, but we had heard of from
Fred's stories.  Like the story of the cat who could only come into
the three adjacent laundry rooms, but not the rest of the house.  Or
the son who was a talented video game player and aspiring musician,
but not willing to go to school for either.</p>

<p class=dream>I met the mom first, and shook her hand.  She was
showing me</p>

<p class=dream>Oh I met the son first and shook his hand, and then he
left and the mom was showing me which three rooms the cat was allowed
to vsit, and I was like, "I've heard of this cat!" to kinda bless her
family with a little bit of fame or notoriety, and her story got
sidetracked because the three rooms were actually rather large and
somewhat confusing for me to understand which three rooms were
allowed; and by room did she mean this entire house that was the size
of a room in the other house?</p>

<p class=dream>We ended up outside by the clothes lines and a cat was
sitting on top of the clothes line and I climbed up on the picnic
table to say HI to the cat and the cat actually smiled at me which
seemed rather surprising since cats seem pretty reserved, but this cat
smiled and then I was petting it and it bit the crap out of my thumb
and drew a bit of blood.  I was glad to realzed it was only a dream,
but my thumb still hurt.</p>

<p class=dream>I sang an impromptu song with the woman, about how I
slept all the way to New York, and it only took five hours, but seemed
even shorter than that cause my dad drove the whole way.  She was
pretty impressed with my song.  It went rather crude at the end
something about my dad was tired so he's going to bed and while he's
asleep give me head or something and I'm like whoah I didn't think I
should sing such lyrics in front of someone I just met but oh
well.</p>

<p>Earlier (before 2am) dream</p>

<p class=dream>The entire world had been clearcut except for the land
next to my dad's house.  I hugged my dad, thanking him for his
stability and for keeping that land.  During the hug he began to hug
someone else as well, and at first I felt jealous, and then I realized
he was bringing other people in to hug _me_.  I felt quite thankful
and quite loved.</p>

<p>Yay Janette for decoding the dream from a week ago!</p>

<p>I've fixed the typos of what she sent me, as I do for all my
dreams.</p>

<p class=lucid>So I held onto Spot and we were moving along a trail
and some other people were having a picnic on the side. They were also
eco tourists and I was new to the group, but my group and their group
knew one another, though they were in different parts of the
group... Our group liked the sun and their group liked something else,
or was it the other way around? and someone in our group yelled
mock-taunting over to them, hey you don't like the sun!  or something
equally silly, and a woman yelled back yeah, well you've got no pants
on! with the implication that we don't like the sun, or we wouldn't
cover up, and we were all oooooh she burned you. and Eric was like,
well, actually she didn't burn him because she also has no pants and I
was like, dude, but did you see who it was-who burned him? She never
does that kinda thing.</p>

<p class=date>8:02am JST Tuesday 3 June 2003</p>

<p class=dream>I was in the passenger seat of my van as a friend of
mine was driving it.  I had been all, yeah, you can have the van; I
won't need it while I'm gone, and then after I had told him that, but
bfore I had actually given it to him, I remembered I had promised it
to Josephine. I was all like, "oh shit."  "Um, I just remembered
something" and I told him that I had already promised the van to
Josephine and that she would therefore get it, not him, and I wondered
about asking Josephine if he could use it just for one road trip and
*then* given it to her, but the issue remained; he had to not wreck it
while he was driving on the roadtrip, and insurance wouldn't cover it
if he wrecked cause it was still in my name, etc.  Eeek.</p>

<p class=dream>Then Jason Ficke was with us and we were stopped at
convenience store and some thugs were around us and Jason was flirting
with them like, "whoo whoo whoo! can't catch me!" kinda thing as he
was climbing out through the sunroof and then when a thug tried to get
Jason, Jason sidestepped and threw the thug headlong into the sunroof,
and he was therefore stuck, but didn't appear inside the vehicle; I
don't know where exactly he was stuck.</p>

<p class=dream>In retaliation, one of the thugs held Spot by his tail
and dangled him down through the sunroof and closed the sunroof on his
tail, but Spot was a remote control radio and shaped like a box with
an antennae, so It wasn't as painful as it could have been when I was
all, "drop him, <b>now</b>" and the guy dropped him by severing his
tail and Spot wouldn't move; I didn't know if he was okay, but he was
just a box, so I knew it wasn't the real Spot, but I was still a bit
shocked by it.</p>

<p class=dream>I escaped this situation by waking up.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class=dream>"Wouldn't it be weird if I woke up and this was all a
dream and I was actually still in Japan?"</p>

<p class=dream>I was back at home.  janette and I were hanging out and
cooking good American food and I was back at home.  We went on an
outdoor tour together and I had Spot with me.  We were riding on the
back of a pickup truck as it was being dragged along the ground. No
wheels. I had to hold Spot so he wouldn't jump off to explore the area
- it was too dangerous for him to safely explore..  Like it was a
jungle; he would have been zapped pretty quickly.</p>

<p class=dream>So I held onto Spot and we were moving along a trail
and some other people were having a picnic on the side. They were
also eco tourists and I was new to the group, but my group and their
group knew one another, though they were in different parts of the
group... Our group liked the sun and their group liked something
else, or was it the other way around? and someone in our group yelled
mock-taunting over to them, hey you don't like the sun!

<p class=dream>By that time in the trip we had stopped and Spot was
allowed to get off, as he seemed content to stay near our thing. and
eat cottage cheese that someone had dropped and I was being asked to
try some new food.  Like some kind of meat or something and it was
okay.</p>

<p class=dream>Then Spot was back on the truck with me and we were
being dragged to the end of the trek and then were back in janette's
living room. So great to be back home again.  What a wonderful
adventure, but I was was happy to be back at home.  Gosh, life sure is
great back at home.  Wouldn't it be weird if this were all a dream and
I was actually still in Japan?</p>

<p class=dream>"Yeah, that would be werid."</p>

<p>D'oh!</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class=dream>I was Eminem and being chased by bad guys.  I was mean,
since I was Eminem, so I had no problem killing people.  Well, it was
a bit tough to slam a guy's face into the corner of something,
especially when he was Lyle from my work, and was all, "I guess i'm
gonna die" in his Lyle way, so I let him live, but just be unconsious
so he wouldn't kill me.</p>

<p class=dream>Lyle had been Mike, and had come in with a 22 pistol
with six shots and when he shot at first, he couldn't see where he was
shooting so he didn't hit me.  I held up an ottoman and was going to
throw it at him, but then I realized he could see the ottoman and
would therefore know where I was, so I used it as a shield and when he
fired his remaining four shots, I caught them with the ottoman, almost
as cool as Neo in the Matrix.  I could just about see the bullets
coming at me.</p>

<p class=dream>I was going to jump outside, but there were bars on the
window and I couldn't break them down.  I was going to throw Lyle
through it, but he was too heavy, so I was going to jump through, but
I couldn't, so I had to sneak out into the hallway and hope they
didn't see it. Jon (who reminds me of my cousin Peter) was out there,
maybe with Jon Lo, and they didn't recognize I was the bad guy cause I
looked like Rob and they were looking for Eminem, but then I climbed
out another window, on the second floor and drop/floated down to a
ledge so I could be on the ground and get a password and be okay.  I
climbed off the house on Methil drive and was crawling back to the
back woods, hoping they would think I was a dog, and I got back to the
darkess where I was safe.</p>

<p class=dream>Watching a large ship in the water moving from Japan to
an island. I was floating out in the water at the time and the ship
accelerated for a while and then decelerated the same amount for the
second half of its journey.  I swam over to its path and found the
water was quite shallow, like only a couple of feet deep and I didn't
understand how such a large boat could have been floating in such
shallow water.</p>

<p class=dream>Then I was floating in the wake of a large man walking
the same path as the boat had taken.  He was a pretty funny guy,
making jokes or something along the way.  Jokes and sound effects.</p>

<p class=dream>I was living back in Tomball except the terrain
included a huge gulley with large piles of dirt like 60+ feet tall to
shape the flow of water.  Some kids were racing motorcycles on it,
destroying the contours and creating a general nuisance of themselves.</p>

<p class=dream>I asked how I could report them and there was to be a
town meeting in a few days run via Robert's Rules and I immediately
wondered if I could remember all the rules so that I could bring up
the complaint.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class=dream>Doing laundry and Eminem was there as well preparing
for his show that was to be that night.  We started talking and he was
friendly and I wasn't nervous, but was just me and we laughed it up
about randomness.  Then I was like, "let me buy a ticket from you" but
he was all, "naw I got my friendlies" or something and was going to
give me a ticket.  He was looking through his bag for one and kept
finding old tickets to old shows.  I woke up before he gave me
one.</p>

<p>My dreams this morning featured people I haven't seen or spoken
with in a while, including Bryn and Marcel.  Each time Bryn shows up
in my dreams lately, I'm quite excited to see her.</p>

<p class=dream>Playing sports on a hill and as I slowly climbed up the
hill to my hotel I was collecting cheap balls and frisbees and such.
The frisbees were ultimate calibre and a guy bit me on the back as I
tried to get away with his frisbee but I started tohit him with it and
he let me go as one of his friends was all, "it's only a frisbee"</p>

<p class=dream>The cool thing about this frisbee - it was printed on
the underside instead of the top.</p>

<p class=dream>I got to the hotel and I had a nerf football.  A kid
was all coming up the hill and I gave it to him.  I walked into the
hotel wearing only underwear and I approached the front counter thing
discreetly and waved the guy over to me.  "Hey man; I know I'm not
exactly fully dressed.  But my clothes are all upstairs."</p>

<p class=dream>"We'll arrest you if you try to come in."</p>

<p class=dream>"No you won't; I'm just going to run up there and get
my clothes and sleep."</p>

<p class=dream>"It doesn't look like you'll be up very early."</p>

<p class=dream>"Yeah I will; I have to be up at 7."</p>

<p><em>... be up at seven .... be up at seven....  seven 7 seven
seven..</em> Oh damn.  that's today.</p>

<p>Thank you brain for waking me up.</p>

<p class=dream>I went to some tourist attraction and Bryn was there
and I'm all "hi, <em>Bryn</em>!" and she goes "I don't want to
explain" so I ignored the gap in communication and asked how she's
doing.</p> 

<p class=dream>We were in some big hall with a huge golden flame in
the middle of the room.  Bryn was excited by something so huge and
nearly yellow so she ran down the steps to check it out.  I followed
her not quite as quickly.</p>

<p class=dream>As she gazed up at it, she noticed something amazing on
the wall - a reflection of Earth, but with the entire globe shrunk to
about five hundred dollars which you are about to give me right now,
he said.</p>

<p>oops I just fell asleep while typing and was dreaming again.</p>

<p class=dream>There was a huge image of the Earth about 30 feet in
diameter and featuring Australia which we were like, how can the image
be projected back onto earth?</p>

<p class=dream>We marveled a bit and then I told her how much fun I've
been having traveling, and she agreed and reminded me that's what she
told me in the first place back in the day.</p>

<p class=dream>I was like yeah and thankful to see Bryn again.</p>

<p>I don't remember what else.</p>

<p>Japanese words are more often showing up in my dreams. A few
Japanese patterns of speech are beginning to feel natural.</p>

<p class=dream>A kid was on the street corner with a yoyo ball thing
that he was throwing toward the street and then yanking it back well
before it hit any traffic.  Then he'd throw it again and yank it back.
He missed catching the ball a few times and was unaware that when he
missed it, he almost hit a woman walking behind him.  This happened a
few times and she was patiently not saying anything but he kept doing
it unaware and I went over to say something to him.  I did so in a
very loving way and he had pretty blue attentive eyes.  I told him
this and he smiled.  I blessed him and the yoyoball toy and went on my
way.</p>

<p class=dream>Found it strange, but not unsettling that I didn't
flirt with the woman, didn't look carefully into her eyes and tell her
how pretty they were.  Didn't even know what color they were.</p>

<p class=dream>Went about my way and noticed that *I* had the
yoyoball; somehow I had forgotten to give it to the kid when I left.
I toyed with tossing it a few times in this large empty gymnasium
thing but found I wasn't very good at it.</p>

<p class=dream>Then I saw a large clear plastic sink full of water -
about 2.5 feet on a side and the drain had just been opened and I was
delighted to see a tight whirlpool all the way from the top to the
bottom of the sink.  I stared down the whirlpool like it was a reverse
telescope or looking down a long tunnel in a fun house.  I love
whirlpools.  The physics is just so magical.</p>

<p>previous dream</p>

<p class=dream>I had just missed the train back home after my year of
being here.  It was bound for Kentucky then Georgia or something wacky
like that.  I had ignored preparation for my trip back home, and
neglected to note that I was supposed to be at the train station by 7
am instead of noon.  Talked to a conductor as I noticed my error and
he noted that the traiin I had intended to take was having a problem
and everyone on the train was getting sick.  I was delighted to have
had my angels' guidance to keep me off a tainted train.</p>

<p class=dream>He asked me where I wanted to ultimately go and by
rerouting the train, everyone on the train recovered and I got to go
where I wanted.</p>
