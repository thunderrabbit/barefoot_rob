<p class=date>6:19am CDT Wednesday 14 June 2000</p></p>

<p><p class="dream">Walking along a road, making pretty good speed, Wende and I
came up to an accident.  The reporters were all on camera talking blah
blah blah about the accident and then a reporter saw my name on my
shirt and asked, &ldquo;Rob, how do you feel about this?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class="dream">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lived in this area for a really long time and have never
actually witnessed an accident so this is really emotional &hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class="dream">As I spoke, I was watching the workers with a big yellow truck
thing dig dirt and stuff out, when a something slipped, and like a
hamburger in a bun, a man got caught between two of the huge wheels.</p>

<p><p class="dream">Just at that moment, I cut myself off, &ldquo;oh my god look over there a
guy just go squished I am not making this up!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class="dream">The cameras whirled around, as we watched the crane lift the big
tire off the guy, and then lift the yellow truck thing that had
slipped.</p>

<p><p class="dream">I became all emotional on camera, partially truthfully, partially
melodramatically for the camera.  I began to cry, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just so sad to
have these people die, but I just have to trust that it&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s Will
and that ultimately there is a purpose to it all.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class="dream">Some workers were building a wall to help keep traffic from flying
off the bridge.  I yelled angrily (for the camera), &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad they&rsquo;re
finally building a fucking wall!&rdquo;  Then quietly to myself,
they&rsquo;ll have to beep that out heh heh.</p>

<p><p class="dream">Wende and I walked away from the cameras just in time to see two
duallies (pickup trucks with 2 tires on each side in the back) racing
through the mud and then up and onto the roadway.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s exactly that
kind of driving that caused the accident in the first place,&rdquo; I
complained to Wende.</p>

<p><p>Have you ever had a dream that you were naked in public?  I just dreamt that Wende was naked in public.</p>

<p><p class="dream">Maggie, Wende and I were all waiting for the school bus.  We weren&rsquo;t high school age, but we were attending high school.  While we waited for the bus, Wende was wearing no shirt nor bra.</p>

<p><p class="dream">When the bus arrived, I was all, &ldquo;here; wear my shirt.&rdquo;  But she wasn&rsquo;t interested.  She just walked very closely behind me, using the back of my shirt to cover the front of her self.</p>

<p><p class="dream">Maggie sat in one of the middle seats, making new friends talking to people.  As I stepped on the bus, I found a shirt which I gave to Wende to wear.  While waiting for her to put it on, I found a seating chart that the bus driver was writing.  She was simply writing for the semester that we sit in the same seats that we chose today.</p>

<p><p class="dream">I wrote Wende and my name in a seat across from Maggie&rsquo;s.</p>

<p><p class="dream">Though we were in the city, the bus ride was way long; we ended up riding around for like 45 minutes until we were out in the country somewhere at a magnet school.  I woke up before we got to school.</p>

<p><p>Dreamt Marcel and I were on the bus on the way home after work.  We
were talking to a man on the bus.. He was basically some stranger that
we met.</p>

<p><p>Once we arrived at the bus station, we had to slide down a sharp
incline to actually get to the terminal/waiting area.</p>

<p><p>Marcel and I were talking nerdy stuff as we visited the restroom to
P.  I was intrigued by the personal space buffer between us.  He peed
at one of a set of 6 urinals, and I chose to not use any of those 6,
but went to a different set on the other side of the wall, selecting
the 2nd to last of 6 urinals.  Another guy came to P and chose the 2nd
to last on the other end, according to the unwritten rule: don&rsquo;t pee
next to a stranger.</p>

<p><p>Then we were magically back at Marcel&rsquo;s work,  His boss asked hi a question about e-mail stuff, and for some reason needed Marcel&rsquo;s password.  Since I was listening, Marcel tried to disguise his password so that he boss would understand, but I would not.  I figured out what it was though: &ldquo;304&rdquo;  (yeah right).</p>

<p><p>Then his office phone rang and it was Gina, looking for Robert to
help her with DSL connection.  As a joke, they gave the phone to me,
and I tried to act all professional, saying Robert isn&rsquo;t in right now;
could I help you?  She asked the question, and I had no clue what she
was talkin&rsquo; about.  I offered to go look for Robert and have him call
her back, but I had difficulty hearing her phone number, but she said
it in Spanish so I got it.  360760</p>

<p><p>I began typing a reminder note to myself in my new Handspring Visor
(a PDA) and woke up.</p>

<p><p>Wende and I were living in the house I lived in during high school.
We had our 3 cats and no parents living there.</p>

<p><p>Two kids were trying to be mean to our cats - trying to &ldquo;catch&rdquo; the
cats messing up stuff at the kids house.  Their idea was to put orange
powder on the cats, and then look out for orange powder at their
house, thereby knowing the cas had been there.</p>

<p><p>I was all tyring to reason with them, to tell the kids to chill and
quit being jerks, but they wouldn&rsquo;t talk to me.  I didn&rsquo;t know their
names or even where they lived.</p>

<p><p>So when they started running toward home, I chased them, determined
to find out where they lived.  Wende yelled for me to stop - not to
chase them.  I walked angrily back to Wende and she explained her
reasoning.  (I don&rsquo;t remember what it was.)</p>

<p><p>Soon enough, the kids came back, confessed their names and the
reason they were acting this way.  Through listening to them, we were
able to find out what was the core problem, which had nothing to do
with the cats, but basically that the kids wanted attention.</p>

<p><p>I dreamt that I had corrupted a database at work, and spent the
entire evening trying to fix it.  Weird thing is that SAS never
entered the dream - only database and the sense that I was having
nerdy fun rebuilding it.</p>

<p><p>Lynda arrived and was hanging from a showerhead to help stretch out
her back while Wende tackled the database problem for me.  Finally
Wende was able to solve it.</p>

<p><p>On my way to work that morning, I was driving my dad&rsquo;s old pickup
truck, (which I drove before I got Scott). The movie Aladdin had just
made it to Blockbuster, and they were selling gold plated turntables.
I stopped in and checked to see if the turntables were Technics direct
drive.  They were not.</p>

<p><p>No one was on the sales floor, so I walked toward the back looking
for someone to ask if they had the kinda turntable I want.  I could
hear someone typing, but they didn&rsquo;t respond to my &ldquo;Hello?&ldquo;s</p>

<p><p>In one corner, they had a wooden train set arranged so all the
trains could go careening down a miniature hill.</p>

<p><p>The mystery typist never responded, so I got back in my truck and
woke up.</p>

<p><p><em>Dreamt I was sitting with YRUU peeps, looking through the
ultimate YRUU mugbook ever compiled.  Hundreds and hundreds of YRUU
youth pictures and all of them labeled by name.</p>

<p><p>Looking through them with me was Bryn, who knows tons of youths&rsquo;
names.  We quizzed each other, and gleefully pointed out names of
peeps that we&rsquo;re close to. We didn&rsquo;t get very far: Moonfrog, Alva and
her brother Sam.  &hellip;  then I woke up.</p>

<p><p>Last night I had an extended remix dream including 18 wheelers used
as roller coaster trains, a huge amusement park with waterslides that
spanned highways and neighborhoods.</p>

<p><p>I was talking/flirting with the woman in the ticket booth, asking
her how I can purchase a season pass to the park.  She had a little
shells just inside the glass window behind which she sat.</p>

<p><p>I stuck my hand under the window to harass the shells a little.</p>

<p class=date>7:12am CDT Wednesday 3 May 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Last night in the wee hours my dream took me to my old apartment.
I felt as if I were going home and then realized, whoah!  this isn&rsquo;t
my home anymore.  In my dream I tried to act cool as if I were
just coming to check out the progress on the apartment.</p>

<p><p>Ex-landlord Mark was happy to show me around.  Walked in and the
first thing I noticed is that the yellow walls / blue ceiling look
(which Wende painted in the bedroom) had been extended through the
entire apartment.  The hardwood floor was all sanded and beautiful -
plenty of space to slide around in our socks.</p>

<p><p>Walked into the bathroom and the tub/shower was all retiled and had
a chandelier hanging over it.</p>

<p><p>In the living room, an entertainment center was built into the wall
with a large flat screen TV built into that.</p>

<p><p>Into the bedroom, huge huge bedroom with a balcony overlooking an
old growth rainforest.  Rope bridge over to a huge platform patio
thing built around a tree.  The look was similar to where the Ewoks
lived in the third Star Wars Movie.</p>

<p><p>From there the apartment aspect of my dream faded and I woke up.</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>This morning I dreamt about youth advising (I dream youth advisor
stuff every night).  This night I was at a continental level youth
event, and I caught two youth smoking in the restroom.  I confronted
them myself and after much discussion, reported them to the youth
leadership of the conference.</p>

<p><p>Last night, as predicted, I had an elaborate dream about all of the
guys from ultimate fighting some battle.  Basically there was a seige
of a castle, though I&rsquo;m not clear on who &lsquo;owned&rsquo; it or who built it.
Most interesting part for me: We magically built a spiral staircase up
to the top of the tower.  The &lsquo;bad guys&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t know about the
appearance of a hole in the roof of the castle, so when they were near
it, I would toss them down to their demise.</p>

<p class=date>7:10am CST Tuesday 28 March 2000</p>
<p class=note>(transcribed from a dream)</p></p>

<p><p>This morning I woke up from a full and complete dream:</p>

<p><em><p>Jon Benet Ramsey was being questioned about her parents and
their actions and about her actions and just various questions about
the living situation in general.</p>

<p><p>I just happened to be there at the questioning; the meeting was at
my church, with a few impartial members asking her things so they
could get a better idea about what would be the best course of action.
I happened to be there and overheard the whole discussion.</em></p>

<p><p>In my men&rsquo;s group, I&rsquo;ve been informally trained as a good listener
and feedback provider.  We each can listen to someone&rsquo;s story, pick
out nuggets or otherwise bring a different light or angle on the
situation.  I did the same thing in my dream with Jon Benet&rsquo;s story.</p>

<p><em><p>The adults in the meeting began talking amongst themselves, and
I got the opportunity to talk with Jon Benet.  I told her what I saw
from my perspective, and described the best suggestion I had to help
her heal the whole thing: forgive those who have hurt her, and
mentally bless and love the whole situation.</em></p>

<p><p>Please note that I have not once really even listened to or read
the whole story as presented by the media.  I am not even sure if I&rsquo;m
spelling her name correctly.  Back to the dream.</p>

<p><em><p>We both had a good cry and I agreed that it could be a
difficult thing to forgive, but I believe it&rsquo;s the only way to heal
this wound.</p>

<p><p>Our conversation ran its entire course naturally with no
interruptions.  We hugged and said goodbye.</em></p>

<p><p>I woke up and recounted the dream.  Then I realized, &ldquo;whoah!
wasn&rsquo;t she murdered?&rdquo;  I wonder if someway somehow our spirits
actually had a conversation that manifested itself to me as a dream?</p>
