<p class=dream>I had clocked out of a different work 10 minutes early
where the boss tried to be in such control that he wanted me to pay
him for the final 10 minutes, or at least not get paid for them.</p>

<p class=dream>He asked me until what time I worked and I'm like
"around midnight" and he's all, "well this says you clocked out 10
minutes early."  (well then that's how late I worked) and in my mind
I'm like, <em>dude, did you want me to clock out later even though I
wasn't doing any work?</em> but didn't say anything except like, "I'll
pay you the money right now; it's not a big deal."</p>

<p class=dream>Then later he came over to my house and I lived with a
bunch of tough guys or mafia guys or something and my boss came over
and had four little dogs with him.  He knocked on the door to ask
about the ten minutes and the two younger (misbehaving) dogs came
inside.  He didn't apologize but immediately was all giving orders to
his other two dogs to go get the first two dogs when I was like,
"there should be no dogs in this house" and suddenly women and
children were screaming in fear behind me (they were apparently afraid
of little dogs) and I'm yelling at my boss, "you do NOT let dogs into
MY house!" blah blah and then "I need some help here!" I called to my
goons inside and one of them came out and the boss guy was suddenly
all scared, "don't hurt my ears!" and I said "don't hurt his ears" to
my goon who kinda rolled his eyes and grabbed the guy's shoulders and
put him up against the wall and probably would have done anything I
said, but with all the emotions running around I woke up.</p>

<p class=dream>I was with friends in a house on the beachfront.  The
house had thick glass walls like an inch thick facing the water.
Across the water I could see a train bridge and maybe a train
station.  We were talking in the living room and suddenly there was a
large swell of waves and the waves were gushing into the house, though
they were dampened by the walls they weren't completly stopped.</p>

<p class=dream>I was afraid for the safety of my computer and asked if
the hosue would remain standing and I was assured it would.  I ran up
the hall and another wave came causing a river of water to flood down
the hall toward me.  I knew I could just stand carefully and let it
flow by.</p>

<p class=dream>I saw a friend of mine out on the beach and he was
pretty far away and possibly in dangered by the waves.  I stood by an
automatic door in the hallway and it opened; I hoped he saw it.  I
heard the yammeryammer Japanese voice greeting as the door opened.</p>

<p class=dream>After the water went by, I ran down another hall
looking for the room where I had left my computer and I went past many
rooms with science experiment looking things, or like science museum
displays that would appeal to various ages.  They were all in glass
rooms and I didn't go investigate them more fully.</p>

<p class=dream>I got to my computer and it was in a room where a
little robot was supposed to be cleaning a miniature floor.  This was
an experiment in artificial intelligence, so I knew this was "just" a
robot, but it seemed to have a good ability to speak English sensibly
if innocently.  It cleaned for a while and then the tray got more and
more full of rice, making it impossible to get everything; the robot
needed a different tool besides just a buffing wheel; it needed a
shovel.  But it kept working anyway, knowing it was doing that which
it had been asked to do.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class=dream>I got back to Kawasaki and Carla told me that she and
Benny were going to some bed and breakfast type thing down down down
somewhere and she was really looking forward to it, and I was envious
that Benny had already been so bold as to get her to go out with him,
etc even though she's been working here for years and he's been here
the same month+ that I have.</p>

<p class=dream>Drew Barrymore was over somewhere like a hostel with me
and she needed to do laundry and I lived at the hostel (had just moved
in) and only residents were allowed to use the laundry facilities so I
said that she could join me doing laundry and we could both say we
were new since I was actually new they could verify the story.  She
agreed and we didn't go immediately, but I went off somewhere else to
get my laundry and then realized oh I have a laundry date with Drew
Barrymore and I ran back and she was still there which made me really
happy, but then I woke up which made me really sad.</p>

<p>(I got over it)</p>

<p class=dream>I had come back to the US and was at Maggie's house.
She lived in a set of condominiums and the pizza guy who was her
friend came to deliver a pizza to some people at the pool, but the
pool was closed and he had no way to know who had been there, nor
where they were now.  So he asked if Maggie would take the pizza,
which she did, but she wrote a note with her umbrella in the cheese,
like she drew a pictogram of the people at the pizza place telling him
"Go take this pizza to the pool" and then him at the pool encountering
a "POOL CLOSED" sign.  Pretty effective for a cheese drawing.</p>

<p class=dream>Maggie and I were chillin' on the bed and were
beginning to be affectionate and then were like "whoops! can't do
that!" and I went home.</p>

<p class=dream>I came home to a big house and needed to throw away
parts of a sandwich.  I went outside to throw it out and I saw a half
dazed crow outside the back porch kinda leaning against the wall like
it was sick.  It turned out to be a half cat half crow.  Like cat body
and face but little wing nubs and a beak.  Very weird.</p>

<p class=dream>The back yard sloped downward steeply away from the
house, so when I looked out into the forest, it was into the forest of
branches with tree trunks below my line of vision, not into a forest
of tree trunks with branches above.  At my eye level, discarded and
caught by the trees and beginning to rust and merge with the
environment was an entire passenger train.  I could only imagine the
previous owners of this house we were in would be surprised to see
this new addition to the back yard.</p>

<p class=dream>I was living with Rie (or was it Koko) and I asked her
if she had a camera so I could take a picture of the crow-cat.  She
did and I gave her a one armed hug from behind.</p>

<p class=dream>I was with the guys from my old work at the Wolf Shop
and there was a new cat there who said he appreciated how respectful I
was of him after I asked him before leaning back against his boots
while we were all piled into the back of a truck.</p>

<p>I had a dream in Japanese!</p>

<p class=dream>Homer Simpson knew Japanese; he was wearing glasses and
asking Ned to fill out a form with the prompts written in Japanese.
Between them, a woman who could read hiragana was trying to help
Ned.</p>

<p class=dream>Homer knew English but didn't translate anything for
Ned cause, being Homer, he didn't think about it and realize this
would be helpful.  He just let the woman stumble through reading the
hiragana and wondered why Ned was clueless not understanding
anything.</p>

<p class=dream>I looked out the window and saw how close I am to
Paris!  This seemed surprising that I hadn't realied it before, but
that I could just jum on a train and go to another part of the city
and visit the Eiffel Tower which was visibl in the distance.  Ryan had
told me how he had climbed the Eiffel Tower and I was like, "hey -
how'd he get to climb to the top of the ET, but I didn't and only got
to climb to the second level??" But if the Eiffel Tower is now
available for my climibng pleasure then so be it.</p>

<p class=dream>Our group went down the hall to Bryn's room and I was
hesitant to go at first since she hasn't written me back; I don't know
if she was mad at me or what, but I went anyway and she had a wall
hanging including different signatures from YRUU type people and I was
near the top of the list.  This made me feel loved and appreciated and
thankful I had come to visit.</p>

<p class=dream>Bryn's mom was there and I gave her a big hug and she
seemed happy with everything, but pointed out that the wallpaper
wasn't hung just perfefctly.  It was green and white vertical stripes
and matched the beautiful kelly green carpet.  I told her that this
place looked great for a dorm room and she outhgtn't worry about it.</p>

<p class=dream>On the train full of YRUUers as we all rode toward the
Eiffel Tower (?) this ex-youth from California whose last name is
White - he was on Youth Council..  anyway, he was driving the train
and we reached the end of the line and he was going a bit too quickly
so they train's emergency braking system had to be used, but no damage
occurred and the stop wasn't all that ahard and I wouldn't have even
noticed had I not seen us go past the end of the line.</p>

<p class=dream>Shira got a tad injured in the stop, like got a slight
puncture wound in her leg or something, but I couldn't really figure
out how that had happened and she wouldn't tell anyone.  But that's cool</p>

<p class=dream>Erin and Rosemary hooked up which was surprising to
most people but they were okay with it so everyone else was too.</p>

<p class=dream>My dad was at church leading the newcomers meeting,
describing what it would mean for them to commit to the church.  He
was winging his speech and I could tell he was nervous.  Afterward, he
was talking to people and I was nearby, but didn't turn around when he
exchanged nice-to-meet-yous with a couple of guys.  I didn't want to
meet them cause they were saying some bullshit about how great his
speech was and it really wasn't.  I was just going to say "man you
were really nervous and it showed" but I didn't want him to lose face
in front of his new friends or for them to lose face in front of
him.</p>

<p>am I turning Japanese?  (in Japan it's socially important to not
make anyone embarassed)</p>

<p class=dream>Dreamt that I was old friends with Eminem and that he
was basically a nice guy who got really popular by emphasizing his
pissed off side.  We talked a bit about old times and how's the family
and stuff like that.  He asked how my mom was doing and she showed up
in the dream and tickled him a bit like she always did with us
(*).</p>

<p class=dream>I talked to Em a bit like, "man I bet you've been busy
as fuck with all this concert shit going on and all that."</p>

<p class=dream>He was like yeah and stuff and asked how things were
going for me.  I thought it was cool that he remembered my name,
etc.</p>

<p>(*) actually I don't remember her ever tickling me.</p>

<p class=dream>Dreamt that I was invited to one more rally.  Eeek!  I
felt honored and a bit weird to attend after I said I'd already
attended my last, and I wondered if I'd be able to remember all the
names of all the kittens I should know.</p>

<p class=dream>We arrived via bus at the Canadian side of Niagra falls
and saw a model of the city in the water below us, floating like a
future version of our society, one filled with glittering beauty all
around.  I realized it was a dream and ran off the edge of the bluff
and flew out over the water, inviting others to come with me.  No one
else could fly like me.</p>

<p class=dream>In a big circle of people someone said "I did something
on next Thursday ago," and I helped prompt him to correct his English.
He got it without me fully giving it away.</p>
