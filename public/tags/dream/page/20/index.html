<p class=date>6:20am CDT Friday 25 August 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Lately, each time I type a dream, I stumble from our bedroom to the
study and start typing my dream.  Always with my eyes closed because
my right-hand brain is watching images of the dream in my head.  When
I watch the words, the pictures tend to fade because my left brain
takes over.  (that&rsquo;s my theory anyway)</p>

<p><p>The end result is that my typing is not perfect - missing letters,
extra letters, misplaced letters, etc&hellip;  After it was complete, I
would go back and tweak the whole thing and edit it into a reader
friendly format.  Today I am choosing not to do that.  The only thing
I have added is the HTML formatting that makes it appear green and
italicized.  (Yep, now is the time to upgrade your browser if most of
the text below is not green and italicized)</p>

<p><p>The blue &mdash;&mdash; lines are dream separations, jumping backwards to the
dream just before the one I typed.  So actually there are 3 dreams
below, with the first two at the bottom kinda related.  To the &mdash;&mdash;-
lines I added (previous dream) to remind you.</p>

<p><p>Last thing - the first dream that I typed (and the most recent one
I dreamt) is the most disjoint because my brain was still cloudy dream
mode when I started typing.  But here you go - my unedited typed
dream:</p>

<p><p class=dream>Why is Steve Kising Frank subtitle</p>

<p><p class=dream>Helping write an Internet chat room - ot just setting it up</p>

<p><p class=dream>We were on a highway or in the median of a higway with thousands of peple drivng by wo may want to chat about this subject</p>

<p><p class=dream>Late Night With Dick Why Isn&rsquo;t Dre Blu completed?</p>

<p><p class=dream>She was all, some people are useless?  Okay, Tony you interview  Mary  who me?  Some people are usueless</p>

<p><p class=note>&mdash;&ndash;(previous dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>Living in my old apartment about to go mow  some grass down the street for money, I mowed past some uys who were mowing a yeard but who didn&rsquo;t mow the slight dithc; I mowed it and then the mowere started to run out of gas so I went back to the apartment to fuel it up and somehow the gas tank was all full of air, but there was water on top of the gas tank like dripping into the tank was the air was sloshed out.   air pressure otherwise was keeping the water out.</p>

<p><p class=dream>  I dumped the water off the top of the gas tank and  then turned teh tank right side up again (the mow right side up) and some residual water poured right into the gas tal tank which had been caught in a tube.  A neighbor a couple of buildings down was all offering me advice on hsome random stuff..  Back&rdquo;  Back when I used tow ork for the oil company, we woul use ogs to blcok oil spills before they hit another oil pit and expoded&rdquo; or something equaly inane.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was all, &ldquo;um thanks&rdquo;  and then my closer but still not next door n</p>

<p><p class=dream>and then
tahnks and his next door neightbor was all, co was all coming down HI whats going on.. and then he aske  he interruped the oil-story guy with, &ldquo;where o  do you live again?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>I didn&rsquo;t know how they could be neightbors and not know who lived whwere but whatefer - it got the old story guy talking to him instead of bugging me.</p>

<p><p class=dream>There was all kinds of trash around, but lots of it was Bob&rsquo;s (wh lives nex doror to us now) and I didn&rsquo;t wantto throw it in the trash can in case he wanted to keep any of it.</p>

<p><p class=dream>There was a baby car seat  and lots of little aquarium rocks, including a pile that I had previously thrown away, and g and a bubble of water under the rocks (as if in a plastic bag, but not)</p>

<p><p class=note>&mdash;&ndash;(previous dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>Wende and I were getting married <em>today</em>  instead of in two years, but we had to wait for Eric and Meredith&rsquo;s ceremony  wedding to be  finished; we were scheduled to be married right fater them in the same location, which I think was our house.    Big big room  and there  their service started late, and we weren&rsquo;t ready yet anyway so that was fine.  fine.  My mom was there to officiate our wedding and I wasn&rsquo;t really nervous but I was totally  not prepared at all.  Just going to wing it or something.</p>

<p><p class=dream>My parents arrived and Maggie loudly greeted them at the ddoor even thought Eric and MEredith&rsquo;s wedding was going on and she may be interrupting it by talking, but she led them away from the wedding to   led us all away from the ceremony thing  to my old apartment and we were in the parking lot walking up the steps, but the door was locked so I had to go in first.  The huge blast trash can thing was in the kitchedn, blocking the path to get in,  so  . So Maggie was going to help me throw stuff awyay and cleear it out of the apartment.  I was all, wiait!  theres a  (phone book or someting) in the trash can; we don&rsquo;t want to throw it away.  but I had the feeling that  It was too far gone to get it.</p>

                        <p><title>Spy vs Spy</title>
<p class=date>5:05am CDT Monday 21 August 2000</p>
<p class=note>(dream)</p></p>

<p><p class=dream>I was totally a spy.  There had been a treasure buried
on the hull of a crashed airplane and the treasure was marked with a
rubber spy-vs-spy (from MAD Magazine) mask.  To get to the treasure,
one had to get the key from inside an elevator shaft, and to get the
key, one had to have a flashlight, and the elevator shaft was in a
fancy hotel somewhere far away from the airplane hull.</p>

<p><p class=dream>We road to the bus stop nearest the hotel in some
desert middle east seeming type of country, all bright blazing hot sun
and dusty sand with dry cracked rocks and mountains all around.
Straight out of Indiana Jones.  Everyone got off the bus and about 3
or 5 people knew about the key in the elevator shaft.  Somehow the bad
guy was on the same bus with us and a different spy had stolen his
flashlight.  I happened to have a flashlight disguised as a plastic
coke bottle (full of coke (actually Dr Pepper)) hidden in my cargo
shorts.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I got off the bus with the crowd and started walking
toward the hotel and Rick saw me walking that way and immediately
turned and walked ahead of me, but he was &ldquo;following&rdquo; me.  Rick was a
good guy.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Behind us we heard machine gun fire as the bad guy
tried to scare everyone into giving his flashlight back.  We kept
walking with intention as if we hadn&rsquo;t heard him.  As we were a few
hundred yards up the road, somehow the bad guy appeared somewhat
before us on the road and he had a chain saw.  He tried to scare the
crowd of people who were all innocent just to see who would freak and
he&rsquo;d know that person was the one who had stolen his flashlight.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I hadn&rsquo;t stolen it, but I knew who had, and I had a
different flashlight in my cargo shorts pocket.  The bad guy started
feigning toward individuals in the oncoming crowd, hoping to scare
someone.  People mostly ignored him as a nuisance.  He approached Rick
and put the chain saw against the back of Rick&rsquo;s neck, but didn&rsquo;t hurt
him.  Then the bad guy put the chain saw against the back of my neck.
I knew who this man was (from previous spy days?)  and he had a pretty
good intuition that I would know something, but I didn&rsquo;t let on.  He
grabbed my sheet that I was carrying and flung it open.  Nothing
concealed inside.  I was all, &ldquo;c&rsquo;mon, man; I&rsquo;m just trying to walk.&rdquo;
He brushed me again with the chain saw in a menacing manner, then left
me alone.</p>

<p><p class=dream>We had just arrived into the hotel at that point and
were walking through the hotel restaurant, and I had the coke-bottle
flashlight in my shorts pocket.  I didn&rsquo;t need it at this moment, so I
hid it in the little phone book cubbyhole of a pay phone on the wall.
I knew if bad guy came back, he wouldn&rsquo;t be so lenient and he would
search me more thoroughly.</p>

<p><p class=dream>We got into the elevator with the key hidden on it, and
didn&rsquo;t need the flashlight because the light was on in the elevator.
I looked out the elevator window and saw that the bad guy had gone down
a different elevator and I knew he would got down a floor or two,
walk over to our elevator, then press our elevator&rsquo;s button, causing
it to go down a floor or two where he could surprise attack us.  I
was pondering how to avert his action without pushing the STOP button
on the elevator, thereby bringing attention to ourselves.</p>

<p><p>And I woke up.  Whew!  Scary dream.</p>

                        <p><title>flying</title>
<p class=date>6:45am CDT Sunday 20 August 2000</p>
<p class=note>(dream)</p></p>

<p><p class=dream>Youth Council YRUU peeps were all floating around in a
pool, talking in small groups.  The life guard asked a couple of youth
who were walking around to either go back to the cabin or to join a
group in the pool.  Duncan&rsquo;s group of about 15 people floated at one
end of the pool as he described a game to his small crowd.  The
lifeguard found Duncan&rsquo;s voice too obnoxious and loud and asked that
he be more quiet.  Immediately Duncan and the lifeguard began tossing
insults back and forth.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Scene shifted so that Duncan was at a picnic table
beside the pool and he had lost a lot of weight after taking a
tremendous potty.  His group was now sitting quietly at the table, and
the insults were still flying back and forth.  I walked around back
beside Duncan and offered that he didn&rsquo;t have to react to the
lifeguard in such a negative manner.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Scene shifted again, and our picnic table overlooked a
couple of kids on bicycles where the bool had been.  The kids were at
Shannon&rsquo;s old house down at the end of Kathy Lane.  (That&rsquo;s the street
I lived on in high school.) One kid threw his bicycle onto of his
sister, and then hid in the shed out of fear from his dad, who came
out and saw us at first; started to come over, but we were all, no and
pointed back at his daughter under a bicycle in his yard.  He was
slightly freaked and didn&rsquo;t know what to do, but his kids came crying
out of the shed and his daughter lifted the bicycle off herself.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Then for some reason we had to walk; we were in fear of
a war going on nearby.  The ground on which we stood had been poisoned
in some way.  We started trudging across the field, and I started to
fly across the field.</p>

<p><p class=note>(lucid dream)</p>

<p><p class=lucid>I recognized I was dreaming and could hear the voices
of my friends saying something like, &ldquo;yeah there goes Rob, showing off
again..&rdquo;  Soon they were gone and I flew alone over this field.  I
flew like superman, and imagined jet propulsion blasting from my feet.
Very close to the tops of the stalks of wheat or whatever the field
was.  I was trying to catch food, and didn&rsquo;t really know what I could
eat, but I flew up higher into some tree branches and tried to catch
some humming birds, which seemed small and bite-sized.  I never caught
one, but kept flying faster and faster over the trees and then into
the burned out shell of an old house.</p>

<p><p class=lucid>Still flying inside the house, but had a little
difficulty manuevering in the small space.  I kept telling myself it
was a dream; I could do anything I wanted.  I flew out a window of the
house over a courtyard entire enclosed by the house, but open to the
outside air.  I began to lose my ability to fly, but stated to myself
as an incentive to keep flying that if I touched the ground I would
force myself to wake up.  I was flying, more like floating in a
standing position, with my jet propelling feet keeping me aloft.  I
pointed my arms and made fists at the ground, and jet propelled with
my fists as well.  This worked and I started to fly upward again, and
even gather speed within the small courtyard.</p>

<p><p class=lucid>I willed myself to fly out of the courtyard and back
into the house through a small window, hoping and expecting a
delicious glass smashing sound, but I basically missed the window and
flew half through the wall above it and half through the window.  No
crashing at all; I just went through with no interaction.</p>

<p><p class=lucid>On my way back out of the house, I began to lose the
dream quality, and felt my awareness back in my body and felt the
wavering wobbling sensation of an out of body experience.  Nice.</p>

<p><p>I recognized that my arms were above my head and were tingling from
lack of blood.  I lowered them to my sides and lay in bed for a while,
trying to get back to dream consciousness.</p>

<p><p>Peter merowled for food, I was almost able to ignore him, but I
realized it was probably actually time to feed him.  Looked at the
clock: 6:32.  Pete was right on schedule.  Smart cat.</p>

<p class=date>3:52am CDT Saturday 19 August 2000</p>
<p class=note>(dream)</p></p>

<p><p>anti racist workshop inspired</p>

<p><p class=dream>YRUU, we were in a house, and about to get on a bus to
go somewhere.  We were in a meeting and (Bitter Bitter) Kate walked
in, but she was like older and coming back from having been in YRUU a
couple of years ago.  I didn&rsquo;t recognizer her..  had heard her name
but not seen her.  It was late at night for this group of youth; we
were all talking..  kinda upstairs in a loft room thing and we heard
someone come in and it was Jen and she had brought Kate with her.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Then it was time for the group to leave so we were all
hopping into my van/bus thing but someone had left their sandals in my
dorm room, so I yelled down out the window at them who&rsquo;s shoes were
these and did they want me to bring them?  &ldquo;They&rsquo;re mine&rdquo; and yes,
from Jen and someone else.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Then we were on the bus and we were talking to a man
with dark skin from a country in Paraguay who was running to be
president of the US.  He described how he had little chance to become
president, but that the tide was slowly turning.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Scene shifted to like a parking lot with chairs all
around the perimeter.  A white man who was dressed in layers of ripped
up clothing was barely able to speak english asked me for some money.</p>

<p><p class=dream>The guy from Paraguay had lots of food and supplies -
he was backpacking across he US</p>

<p><p class=dream>I started cooking some eggs and forgot about them and
began talking to a man who appeard to be from the middle east.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I walked over to him and was all, motioning something
like, &ldquo;are you hungry?&rdquo; and then &ldquo;do you speak English?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>He said in perfect non accented English, &ldquo;yes, I am
teaching my kids German, old German, English, Hindi. He had two
infants with him - well toddlers, but they were in basket things and I
held out my hand to &ldquo;give me five&rdquo; and the one kid taught the other
how to do it by giving me five.  He was all, &ldquo;watch&rdquo; and slapped my
hand, and the other child did a sloppy job of it.  &ldquo;okay, turn your
hand over&rdquo; and then I brushed my hand to give him five.  He was a
baby; I didn&rsquo;t want to slap his hand.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Then their dad was all, &lsquo;what is this give me five?&rdquo;
and I taught him how to do it.  He did a bad job and missed my hand,
but hit my wrist the first time.  He showed me his country&rsquo;s custom of
kissing back of hand.  His skin was very dark and I kissed the back of
his hand.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Then my dad called me over, &ldquo;Rob need your help&rdquo; and I
was all, &ldquo;excuse me&rdquo; to the guy, and oops the eggs were pretty burnt.
Mimi was over near them and I was chanting some Beastie Boys lyrics as
I tried to salvage the eggs.  They weren&rsquo;t totally burned, but the
plastic spatulaa I had used was melted on the edge of the skillet.  I
threw it in the trash, and it seared a hole in the trash bag as it
fell into the garbage can.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p></p>

<p><p class=dream>We were at SWUUSI (week long youth camp) inside a
building at a workshop. a boring workshop and it was more like a
lecture..  I was wanting to be outside playing.  Youth were coming in
disruptfully and the guy up front, who had been reading asked one of
the youth o read instead.  The youth (Ken, who was in our local LRY
and graduated in 1998 or so) was reading all quietly so no one could
hear.  I bruskly said, &ldquo;speak up,&rdquo; and the previous speaker chided
mean for not being more shill.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Then the room melted into us being outside a shopping
mall - basically the back of the room opened up into a parking lot,
where youth were playing catch with some shoes, but coming close to
hitting our group.  I was watching them through the reflection on the
wall and when I shoe almost hit me, I got up and threw it into a trash
can (in a disempowering way), instead of asking them to be more
respectful of our meeting.</p>

<p><p class=dream>They grabbed the shoe again and were tossing it around
the parking lot some more (there was a small amusement park in the
middle of the parking lot, with a white picket fence around it).  Phat
Pat and Ian were the one playing catch with the shoe.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Then my focus shifted to a car that was parked beside
the curb and youth were all around it and inside it, again being
disrespectful of the owner/advisor who was in the car.  Someone pulled
the car closer to the curb (like literally grabbed the door and drug
the car sideways) just to do it.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Then Amanda (youth from Bay Area) was all lamenting
that she had been unable to go search for natural gems back in some
secret hidden place where we were not supposed to be anyway.  Maybe in
a year or two.</p>

<p class=date>6:04am CDT Wednesday 16 August 2000</p>

<p><p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was sleeping and heard the weather report on 740
KTRH, the am 24 hour news radio in Houston.  The weather guy said that
a big storm was coming toward the city and he advised that everyone go
buy some duct tape and tape up windows so they wouldn&rsquo;t be broken by
the storm.  I woke up in my dream and the storm was already pounding
rain against the windows.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Went downstairs to find Wende to tell her; she was in
the shower like in a basement and there was a small spider crawling on
the shower floor.  I shooed the spider away from her and didn&rsquo;t kill
it.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I told Wende about the storm and that it was pretty
much too late to go get duct tape, so we just waited and I woke up for
real.</p>

<p><p class=note>(different dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>Wende and I were living together in the Methil house
(where I lived from 3rd to 7th grade) and we had our cats and
everything.  I dreamt we were sleeping and that I felt a sharp pain in
my neck during my sleep, but thought nothing of it.  Wende woke up
before me and was getting ready for work when we went outside for
something.  I was only wearing a shirt.  We were talking about my
decision to be on the KTRU Council.  I felt that I really should do
it; no one else represented my demographics: non-student, barefoot,
adult.  I owed it to KTRU to be on the council.</p>

<p><p class=dream>As we were going back inside, a van drove up all loud
music and stuff.  I flashed them by lifitng my shirt as they pulled
up. They were giving away bags of potato chips and water.  The water
was their product they were trying to sell.  Giving away free samples
to raise product awareness.  We thanked them and went inside; they
presumably drove off.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Back inside we went inside and I tried to take my shirt
off, but it was stuck to my neck.  I reached back there to find what
was wrong, and horrorified to find that the security tag thing that
keeps people from stealing clothing was still on the shirt, and its
needle had stabbed and stuck in my neck vertebra.  I was so freaked
that I could hardly tell Wende what had happened, but pulled it out of
my spine and took the shirt off to show her.  I was all considering
the best way to medically treat it; go to a hospital or what..</p>

<p><p class=dream>Then I dreamt I was asleep again and the KTRU DJs were
at a wild party, which included peeing on a big plastic tarp.  I was
about to join the fun and then I woke up.</p>

<p><p>I had to pee.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;m awake now.  ;-)</p>

<p><p class=dream>Looking over the FSD financials with Kevin, he said I would
get $6000 as a bonus at the end of the year.   We had a project that would
net us 110,000,000,000,000,000 dollars.  I was all, &ldquo;Kevin, that is more
then the debt of the US Treasury; how can this be???&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=note>(different dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was in a shopping mall with continental YRUU youth and
looking at some videos in a movie rental place.  They were all old school
videos, including <em>The Making of Batman</em></p>

<p><p class=dream>This video seemed weird because it showed scenes I didn&rsquo;t
remember from the movie.  This did not trigger me to think I must be
dreaming.</p>

<p><p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>We were on a Hawaiian Island in a big field.  We = a lot of
YRUU people.  Someone said, look at that tornado they&rsquo;re having over there.
We looked over and certainly there was some cloud disturbance, but it was
not a tornado.  A youth told him so.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Then from the same direction, something was coming toward us,
and there were screams from that direction.  It was a flood of water
careening across the land, and headed toward us.  Many people ran away from
it, but I ran sideways across its path, kind of up hill.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I ran to a picnic table and was followed by two youth,
Micaela and Matt.  They said that this flood was the doing of some powerful
individual who was trying to frighten people off the land.  They had been
given some sort of voucher that bought them out of a portion of their land
after the previous scary thing.  This was just another such event.</p>

<p><p class=note>(another dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>Computer was on in this house and we could see an eror log
coming up about AIM instant messages being sent and errors from this one
computer that could not connect.</p>

<p><p class=note>(another dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream> was walking with a with Blue who had her eyes closed and was
walking backwards, like a trust walk and I told her &ldquo;step up&rdquo;  &ldquo;step down&rdquo;
as appropriate and then we all (there was a group) reached this huge large
overlook bluff thing that looed over the city.  I couldnt&rsquo;t safely navigate
her blindly down this steeep hill, so we stopped and had our trustees open
their eyes.</p>

<p><p class=date>7:16</p>

<p>I thought it was 6:15, but in this here time zone it&rsquo;s 7:15 and breakfst is
in 15 minutes.  Thanks, Steve for knowing what&rsquo;s the time!</p>

<p><p class=date>7:38</p>

<p><p>Nathan:
<pre>
Oh Nathan I&rsquo;m so fine
I&rsquo;m so fine I blow my mind
hey Nathan</p>

<p>Oh Nathan what a pity
I don&rsquo;t understand.
I take me by the heart
when I take me by the hand
</pre></p>

<p><p>These youth are so funny!!</p>

<p><p>I cried after the anit-racisim workshop today.  That was not the
intention of the workshop, but I realized just how racistally I have acted
in the past.</p>

<p><p class=date>11:04</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;re in the computer lab looking at the yruu website and some possible
new sites</p>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s during this that I wrote my HI and Bye entry on Wednesday.</p>

<p><p>I expressed encouragment that the group take a proverbial step back from
the website design process and ask the basic questions of intended audience
and goals of the site.</p>

<p><p class=date>12:20pm</p>

<p><p>Lunch was cool; I talked to Christine who works for anti-racism stuff in
the UUA.  She&rsquo;s cool.</p>

<p><p class=date>14:13</p>

<p><p>just did brainstorming for 5 year YRUU plan</p>

<p><p class=date>15:10</p>

<p><p>Paris is so funny!  He just made the statement that he intends to
memorize the continental YRUU bylaws within 1 month.</p>

<p><p class=date>17:57</p>

<p><p>now it&rsquo;s after dinner..  Paris just played the entire &ldquo;Happy Phantom&rdquo; by
Tori Amos</p>

<p><p class=date>18:39</p>

<p><p>Ultimate was way fun for a few minutes, and then just tossing around with
jason.   Free time now while some committees are meeting.
 (ultimate was during free time)</p>

<p><p class=date>19:52</p>

<p><p>We just got mail and I got a letter from Wende!!!   A card actually.  So
loving and perfect!!</p>

<p><p>The ultimate disc was missed by Nathan (who really tried to catch it) and
is floating in the duck pond.  Eww.</p>

<p><p>I did some optical analysis of the pond and have determined that it is
spring fed.  I can&rsquo;t see an exact specific spot that it comes in, but an
area of the water is certainly more clear.</p>

<p><p class=date>20:30   Wednesday evening</p>

<p><p>We ran about 1.5 miles I&rsquo;m guessing - jogged more like and happened to be
near where the band was practicing so I watched them for a bit.  Turns out
that toomorrow they are having their last day of practice and then it&rsquo;s
parents&rsquo; night at 7pm or so.  I wonder if we will be able to watch it.  I
think so; we usually have a break around then, but I don&rsquo;t know for sure.
After running we played frisbee some and now I&rsquo;m going to take a shower.
Wait..  we have a dance tonight; I&rsquo;ll just get all sweaty again.  Doh!!
I&rsquo;ll inventory my clothing and see if I&rsquo;ll change or not.</p>

<p><p class=date>21:15pm</p>

<p><p>YRUU is the greatest thing on the planet.  We just had a cool worship
that included a ceremonial bridging by each individual walking across a
bridge that crosses a stream in what would otherwise be an open grassy
field.</p>

<p><p>But that&rsquo;s not why YRUU is the greatest thing in the world.  I was just
talking to Justin about hip hop and turntablism and DJ stuff when he was
all, &ldquo;hey, do you think you could get my album on the air?&rdquo;   I am thrilled
to put it through the music library process and I told him so.  Maybe we&rsquo;ll
get his album on the air!</p>

<p><p>But that is not why YRUU is the greatest thing in the world.  We just
learned a game called &ldquo;54 categories&rdquo; (or something) which is a rhythmic
clapping and requires quick verbal thinking and is pretty funny.</p>

<p><p>But that&rsquo;s not why YRUU is the greatest thing in the world.  YRUU is the
greatest thing in the world because it is.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>At 10:30, we meet our blind dates for a dance.  I&rsquo;m supposed to meet mine
at room 208.</p>

<p><p class=date>23:52</p>

<p><p>The dance was fun, and my dream came true!  Almost..  The dance ended
early as we received news that a powerful thunderstorm is approaching the
campus.  50 and 60 mph wind apparently.  So we all trekked back uphill to
the dorms.</p>

<p><p>Even though we are certainly expected to stay inside the dorms, I would
love to go outside and experience it.  I don&rsquo;t know if I will or not; there
are lots of youth in the hall.</p>

<p><p class=date>12:38am</p>

<p><p>I joined several youth watching the storm on the outdoor balcony of our
building.  A few youth slid down the grassy hill like a waterslide!  That is
way way so much fun, but I chose not to join them.  The rain was pretty
cold, just when it splashed us on the balcony; I certainly didn&rsquo;t want to be
soaked.</p>

<p><p>When I came in here to write this entry, I believed the storm had mostly
passed.  But we just got a big-ish thunderclap.  I still think the storm is
pretty much finished.</p>

<p><p class=date>12:42am Thursday</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m going to bed.</p>

<p><p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>in this dream I lived on Methil drive at the inside a corner:</p>

<pre>            
                   * = my apartment
          * |      - = Methil
------------|      | = a different street
</pre>

<p><p class=dream>each week I would walk down to Matt&rsquo;s house to spend
the night.  This time when I went down, it was like 1am by the time I
got there; too late to knock on their door.  So I headed back. I found
a hot red pepper on the driveway again this week and started eating it
on the way home.  On the way home, there was a large garbage can being
used to boil some hot peppers and corn on the cob.</p>

<p><p class=dream>the guys beside th trash can had a pepper tied to each ear of corn and were going to eat it.  i offered them each a bite
of my pepper, but they refused, saying it would be too hot.  i asked
for a piece of theirs then, but there was some type of anger when
the one guy gave me a piece.  i was all, &ldquo;do you want it back?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s yours now.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>so i left and ate it, kinda watching over my
back, fearing they would throw a knife at me.</p>

<p><p class=dream>then a car drove by and turned in front of me, i was
scared at first, but he was stopping to talk to his friend in a
different car with a lovely female in the back seat being driven
somehwere. it was 4am by this time and she was dressed exceptionally,
down to nice high heel shoes and dress.  i wondered why she was
dressed this well so early in the morning.  the other guy got in the
car beside her, and left his truck on the street.</p>

<p><p class=dream>i recognized that somewhere in the world it was evening
or midday, maybe she was going to an event somewhere else in the
world.  the president does that, i reasoned.  why not she.</p>

<p><p class=dream>as i was walking the rest of teh <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of a blcok to get
back to my apt, my hips started to hurt so badly that I could hardly
walk because they hurt so much.  i stopped walking and noticed a woman
and kid across the street walking and i felt embarassed in front of
them for having gotten so old that my hips were hurting.</p>

<p><p class=dream>i rested there for a moment. and woke up wondering
about something.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>we were the poke' mons. (ack).  I was Shadowe.  Other names were hollered like "blodle" and "chilsed" or "aglonse"

<p class=dream>shouted names as we  moved from otside parking lot into 1 story strip center bulding room.  big empty room and we all went in and it was my job to write the rules on the door on the inside of the glass door in dry erase marker.  rule like Do Not look at the answeres before the quest is finished.

<p class=dream>as I was writing, the door was all moving (being a door on hinges and all) so David J helped hold it steady  (from LRY)  and then Adam L (OKC) wanted to write the next rule he said, so I gave him the marker and the surface on which he wrote was no longer the door, but the floppy  fabric of his unbuttoned button-down shirt, which he was wearing.  he signed his initials in highliter on the shirt.

<p class=dream>I was all, "what about writing the other rules? and he was all, "I got it" as in "I'll do it."  so he began to write.  then I was trying to figure out what I was feeling, what I was trying to stave off.  what is this feeling and I woke up.

<p>this is interesting to have actually caputured the moment in my dream just before transition to waking up.  it wasn't like the cats woke me up, but I was introspectively trying to figure out what I was feeling in the dream and woke up.

<p>hmmm
