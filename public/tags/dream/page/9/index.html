<p>Sitting with two of Andy&rsquo;s long-time friends, I got to hear how he became associated with the Pink Cow.   He had been working in a bar serving beer when a guy noticed how precisely Andy served the beers, taking great care that each one was optimally poured with a perfect foamy head that just crested the top of the mug. The guy asked Andy if he could mix drinks as well.  Andy was like, &ldquo;I can mix any drink you can name.&rdquo;  The guy named a few drinks and Andy mixed them perfectly, better than the guy had ever previously tasted.  Could Andy cook?  Absolutely; it turns out that Andy&rsquo;s hands have a different DNA than the rest of his body; his hands themselves know how to prepare any dish ever prepared or ever desired.&mdash;-</p>

<p>Why was I dreaming about Andy at <a href="https://www.thepinkcow.com">The Pink Cow</a>?  I guess it&rsquo;s time to go back and check out the new location again!!</p>

                        <p class=date>9:29am JST Saturday 27 December 2003</p>

<p class=dream>I was a spy and was asked to sneak into a small room
  and use a power drill with a grinder bit to cut a power cable to
  the building.  The room had a glass window and a bad guy was
  cleaning the window from the other side with a power sprayer. I
  wondered if, like in a movie, he would cover the window with suds,
  just allowing me to cut the calbe before he saw me.</p>

<p class=dream>He didn't cover the entire window, and the room started
  to move.  Oh, the room was white and I was wearing a black body
  suit, though he still didn't see me.  The room started to move a
  bit, making it difficult for me to freeze myself (in an
  uncomfortable position to make it look like I must be dead (or
  sleeping)) against one corner, but that's what I did.</p>

<p class=dream>He continued to not see me, but (Mike's) high school
  Miki came up and she saw me from the bad guy's side of the window.
  She came into the room and I began to actually fall asleep, which I
  didn't exactly want to do cause I wanted to stay aware of the
  situation, and she came up to me and I figured she was my friend and
  wanted to help so I was like, "distract that guy" or "turn off the
  lights" or something and she ignored me or didn't understand or had
  her own objectives.</p>

<p class=dream>She got really close and gave me a kiss on the cheek
  and the guy noticed now and he started to chase me.  I knew I could
  fly so I flew horizontally down the hallway (*) and then up through
  the roof of the building so I was outside flying among the trees
  above a garden party with a lot of well dressed bad guys (men and
  wonmen) discussing whatever bad guys discuss at garden parties.</p>

<p class=dream>I was being chased by more people who could fly, so
  when they came up to my level, I launched myself up higher than they
  could fly.  (haha beat that, suckas!) and then HS Miki came up to me
  and we and I told her I love her and we started kissing.</p>

<p class=dream>Told her that I want to marry her and she was like,
  "cool," and our friends were like, "okay, take these [marriage
  licenses (that looked like drivers licenses)] that we forged before
  and put them in your wallet."  So we weren't actually married, but
  we could claim we were; we had the documents to prove it.</p>

<p class=dream>We were then free of the bad guys and I was walking
  alone down Methil street (**) and saw Suzanne with some kids she was
  babysitting.  She was dropping them off to someone else, so she had
  some free time.  We were in an S&M bar and I gave her a huge
  spanking, though I couldn't quite get the right [smack], and it was
  more like just hitting her with my palm.  No [crack!] of a good
  swat.</p>

<p class=dream>She was still happy with them and we walked out, "thank
  you; see you later," and we were walking and saw Neil and Ryan
  walking to work.  Neil was on his cell phone saying, "I'm going to
  work now, yeah in Shibuya" and I was like, "did you hear him say
  Shibuya?" to Suzanne, wondering if she could understand the language
  here in Japan.  (he was speaking in English)</p>

<p>Woke up two minutes before my alarm went off.</p>

<p>(*) quite lucid if I can fly horizontally; usually up is all I can
manage.</p>

<p>(**) my old house (when I was 8 yrs to 13 yrs old)</p>

<p class=dream>I was masturbating in my room and realized that people
  outside behind me could see me so I stopped and turned around.
  They were peeking out their windows, and looked like they hadn't
  seen me, but then one guy does a jackoff motion question mark and
  I (in a cheerful way) gave them the finger.  "haha fuck you for
  looking" kinda thing.</p>

<p class=dream>One of the guys came outside and was talking to me and
  then dreamshift and I was watching this bird slash friend eat
  seeds, but he couldn't pick up a certain seed with his beak so he
  cocked his head over to pick it up with his <b>eye</b> using
  adhesion from his tears (*)</p>

<p class=dream>I was like, "hey um, Mr bird, what name can we humans
  call you?"</p>

<p class=dream>He was like, "Poppyseed"</p>

<p class=dream>"Poppyseed, did you just pick up that seed with your eye??"</p>

<p class=dream>"Yeah blah blah blah..." some explanation he gave made perfect
  sense to us.</p>

<p class=dream>Wow; cool.  We had a newfound respect for the nature of
birds.</p>

<p>(*) not tears, but ambient eye moisture.  Is there a word for that?</p>

<p class=dream>Dreamshift and then we were with Samuel L Jackson who
  was doing fung shi on his new house that was rather huge.  I helped
  him walk around the perimeter and seal it with a symbolic fan of
  some sort.</p>

<p class=dream>I was coloring a picture of three chefs in a coloring
  book.  Just systematically slowing filling the shapes with color,
  being careful not to go outside the lines, gently slowly filling in
  all the nooks and crannies.</p>

<p class=dream>I was with a male friend of mine, working on this
  little project with him.  In the background a rock band was playing
  covers of loud 80s rock bands, kinda one step down in loudness from
  glam rock.  My friend was then cleaning up some wax and talking to
  it like, "I don't have time for this; I don't care if you are my
  girlfriend; I gotta go."</p>

<p>And I'm like, "wha?!" and woke up because I gotta go to Japanese
  lesson!</p>

<p class=dream>At KTRU but I wasn't supposed to be the one DJing and I
  turned off the station when I left, kinda thinking that the signal
  must be coming from somewhere else than this studio, as I was not
  the official DJ for that timeslot.  I walked out of the studio,
  which was like a kiosk sized building in the middle of an entrance
  to a university and Ali came up some stairs (from underground) to be
  like, "what happened?"  except he goes, "was that Scott or J-lo who
  just left the station?" "what do you mean? There is no one there
  now" "cause you just went off the air."  and it was only then that I
  realized that *had* been the signal and I was mad that they were
  doing a half ass job of DJing, or actually a no ass job cause they
  weren't even there; what kind of thinking is that; anyone can just
  put on a single CD and leave the studio.  In fact, it is an FCC
  violation to do that, to leave the station unattended.  So I went
  back in there to start DJing and woke up.</p>

  had the same hiragana and make like a crossword puzzle with

<p class=dream>I was living with some women roommates, including a
  Morag-energy and her roommate Lisa-energy woman.  Morag and I were
  past the sexual tension and were chilling (in the bathtub) together
  (with clothes on, in the water, but not soaked) and Lisa came in and
  offered to have sex with us and I was like "yeah" partially, but I
  knew it would be inappropriate so I was like, "naw," and then I
  realized it was a dream, so I was like, "yeah," but then it was too
  late.</p>

<p class=dream>My roommate left a mess in the restroom.</p>

<p class=dream>I was in my apartment here in Japan (and Fred was over)
  and Elizabeth Anderson (YRUU, Austin) came over specifically to say
  goodbye; she was leaving.  I invited her in, chatted with her a bit,
  Fred gave her a big hug, and then she left.</p>
