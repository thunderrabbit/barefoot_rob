<p class=date>4:32am</p>

<p>stretch turn sleep after almost making it to sleep

<p class=date>6:18</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>tossing and back and forth wake to almost alseep, seeing wende in my deams then waking up.

<p class=dream>then soon asleep and on an outdoor patio type thing with wooden slats and big oak trees around it,.  then asking my friend if I could ride his unicylce.  he was all, "um, my other friend is coming over," plus he had taken the pedals off the cycle.  So I just hopped onto my own unicycle and was riding it with zero problem at all. I was even on a giraffe  cycle, with the long neck and riding and had to duck below trees and even hit the trees a bit, but still rode through no problem.  I went almost all the way around the block where we lived from my third grade to 7th grade years, but my back wheel came out from under me part way around, but I was still riding on the front wheel, trying to get the back wheel re-aligned under my butt.  Never could quite do it, although I was in continuous riding motion the entire time.  the fact that my unicycle had two wheels never seemed odd.  Finally got around the bock and parked in my driveway and got off and woke up.

<p class=date>6:23am</p>

<p><p>gonna feed the cats now.</p>

<p><p>lovely that they did not wake me up last night (except spot for once just before I got to sleep for real.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>In a dark alley with goons around, trying to take my
watch and wallet, I was all, &ldquo;No&rdquo; but they kept chasing me, until I
ended up in a warehouse that was actually like a bunkhouse where my
cousin peter was staying.  He was playing cards on a card table with
Fred, playing spades, and I ran past them and jumped on the bed, and
the goons started playing cards as if distracted but also as if
nothing had happened.  Fred and Peter were pleased to have them join,
and welcomed them.  The the game was over and they all started chasing
me to get me to play cards and I ran outside into the woods and was
running to get away from them.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I realized it was a dream so I tried to get up some
speed to fly.  There were lots of trees around me, and I was able to
fly a little bit.. then the ground fell out below me as I reached the
edge of a cliff, and I flew out over the trees in the valley below.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Was able to fly pretty well, but not with the
extraordinary speed that I craved.  I kept trying to push myself
faster, but it didn&rsquo;t work.  I imagined myself with essentially
superman power, flying with fists forward and that helped.</p>

<p><p class=dream>The coolest was flying really low to the ground between
two oncoming freight trains.  My jet power motion flying between the
oncoming trains made my apparent motion just SO fast.  Wonderful!!</p>

<p><p class=dream>When I was done flying, I disengaged from a video game
thing.  That explained how I had been able to fly.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was in an arcade, and looked for some change so I
could play again, and I found a tray with many loose dimes and nickels
which had been discarded since they were not quarters.  There were
some quarters in the pile, but they were from different countries, or
different original 13 colonies, and therefore the wrong size to be
quarters for the machine.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I collected the coins one at a time and noted that one
dime was made of silver!  Oooh it must have been a pre 1965 dime.  I
looked and the date was from like 1908 and then it changed to 1408.  I
was quite impressed to have found such a rare and valuable coin, and
had a little twinge of this must be a dream. I vaguely looked around,
and thought no, it looks real.  Awesome!</p>

<p><p class=dream>Then I found a dime from 2011, and the design had the
year written in roman numeral MMXI which was pretty cool.  Wow!  A
coin from the future!  I&rsquo;m so lucky since this is real!</p>

<p><p>Hungry cats woke me up.</p>

<p>been reading java for 2.5 hours.  cool stuff.

<p class=date>3:57 am Sunday 24 July 2000</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>at a hotel, parking lot, after having driven up while tired, all my stuff was in the car as I waited for the other passengers to get their stuff out, but once they got it out, they didn't wait for me to get my stuff out.  then some other youth were in the car (kT for one) and I think Mike L for the other (Danielle's ex-um friend) and I asked them to help me carry everything inside in one trip.  I loaded up a bunch of coin collection stuff on Mike. 

<p class=dream>hotel converted into my house and we were chillifying on the couch, Elise was asking me if she could be one of my patients as I had just begun my schooling at USM.  I told her that I could not be her therapist, ought not, because then we wouldn't be able to play like this (many other people were around as we all flopped on the couch, her on my lap.)

<p class=dream>and she was all, well in school, we are encouraged to talk to our friends, when we have problems, and you are my friend, so I should be able to talk to you if I want.  

<p class=dream>I didn't have an answer for her. that logic seemed correct.

<p class=dream>I was alone in the house, and it was really getting messy.  ridiculously messy with dishes teetering in the sink, broken chairs,  food spilled on the floor, old half cooked pancakes on the stove,.  my friends had been over and made a wreck of the place, and I knew I needed to get it cleaned up, but I just had to take a nap first.  

<p class=dream>sleeping and then my mom called and I grabbed the phone so as to not let my parents be woken up and it was my mom who said "we are leaving for Australia in 40 minutes."

<p class=dream>I hung up on her in a rush to get off the phone so I could get ready in time.  Tossing clothes into my green bag,  digging out of the mess stuff to bring, wondering if I should bring australian coins from last year or just get all new ones. 

<p class=dream>my mom got up and was gettng ready as well,  the idea was that the house alarm would go off in 40 minutes, and we would have to leaving right at that moment, before the alarm monitoring company would call to see if it was a real alarm.  

<p class=dream>I was trying to clean up stuff as I grabbed clothes, wondering if I should just bring all shorts or if i would need some pants. what about shoes?

<p class=dream>there was a brick and I asked ma where she wanted it, and she said "I dunno it's your brick", so I threw it out into the yard with all the other bricks in the front yard.

<p class=dream>the reason we were getting ready so fast and leaving so fast was so that dad wouldn't be ready on time and therefore wouldn't go.. that was my mom's plan, in an effort to go without him

<p class=dream>I was loading stuff into my pockets watching some fluffy birds, some white birds in cages and tinkerbell woke me up trying to sleep by my head.

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>In a walgreen's type store, I saw a new nine inch nails CD that I hadn't seen before.  I 1/2way recognized it was a dream, and began to carefully memorize the image on the CD.  interesting thing that on the bottom of the picture on the back, which appeard to be simply a photograph of the stage being set up, I noticed that the people near the bottom were all images of John Goodman at various stages of his life all with the same expression of no emotion.

<p class=dream>and the lo, trent was there with me, and I was talking to him about just general stuff.

<p class=dream>as I studied the Cd case, I said "trent," and gave him a kiss on the cheek, "I love your music."   he said thanks and was willing to answer random various questions, which I don't remember the questions or the answers.  but he showed me the new nine inch nails logo, which was a clear crystal with NINININI etched onto the bottom,and if viewed correctly, appeard as NIN (backwards N) and when held upside down,  appard as ni(backwads n) (lowercase)..  I studied and marveled at that logo for a while, . it was like melted into the plastic, or like a bubble in the plastic of the jewel case.

<p class=dream>then he showed me another image on the Cd.  when viewed straight on it appeared as static, but when viewed at an angle, it was an image of trent's skull with a chrome appple in the middle of it and gentle hands cradling the apple, all inside his skull.  That image was more like a hologram thad a 3D actual shape though.

<p class=dream>then he said somthing and I thought he had to go, but no. he just wanted to show me the 4th CD that was available, and I almot got the happy feeling that he was going to purchase it for me (and maybe all 4) so I followed him to a different part of the store, and thought about telling him that I had grabbed the microphone when he threw it out into the audience when he played in Austin (true story), but I didn't.  the different part of the store to which we walked was actually just on the other side of a person who had been standing beside us at the CDs.  I noticed that this was odd, and I woke up.

<p>(this is an example of me only being slightly expectant and then disappointed at not having the coveted item in real life out of my dream)

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>explaining to my boss kevin why having playstation at a rally is better than trying to set up a playstation workshop&hellip; just have it available and people will play it whenever they want instead of trying to force the fun to happen at a certain time.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was watching movie set in the old west mexican american war and the bad guys rode into town and said, &ldquo;here take care of my bosses head&rdquo; and the head had beeen severed, some spanish curly locks conquistador with moustache and he threw it at the townsfok and they shouted &lsquo;outlaw!&rsquo; and started chasing him out of town and a big gunfight broke out and the bad guy decided it was hopeless and shot himself in the mouth and didn&rsquo;t die so he tried to burn himself to death and wouldn&rsquo;t die and it was (the movie) was supposed to be a comedy, but I was grossed out and quit watching it.</p>

<p><p class=dream>at my old apartment, a guy drove up the driveway ramp with his old red and white convertible  car 60&rsquo;s classic something and had a bicycle in the back , which he locked up at someone else&rsquo;s apartment and the someone else came down the stairs and was mad so he moved the bike out of the way and was all, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get out of my stairs so tie up your bike somewhere else&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>the bicylce owner didn&rsquo;t confront the guy, but got mad and I offered some ideas for how he could hang the bike inside..  He lived in Suzanne&rsquo;s old apartment, and when I went in, it was really huge inside, 2 story ceilings with large large rooms although still old inside.   he had put a large cloth divider between the living room and dining rooom for most of the width of the room, but there was one section open.  my idea was to use a system of pulleys to raise the bike all the way to the top..   to hang the bike and raise it all the way to the ceiling.  He said he had thought of that, but didn&rsquo;t want to sepend the time to do it.  I was all like, &ldquo;fine that&rsquo;s your chocie..&rdquo; but I asked, &ldquo;how much is it worth to you to have this done?&rdquo;  He said &ldquo;my monday&rdquo; I guessed referring to it was worth working during Monday to get it complete. I was all, &ldquo;I look forward to seeing it!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>Racing Sean from ultimate across a field to the gymnasium door.  He won, but just by a little bit.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Then changing clothes in the locker room like back in high school and college, but this time there were also two girls watching me.  I ignored them essentially (or more like didn&rsquo;t treat them any different that two guys) and changed in front of them.  Instead of shorts I put on my old &lsquo;MC-Hammer&rsquo; jams, but then took those off and went looking for shorts until I woke up.</p>

<p class=note>dream</p>

<p><p class=dream>I feel like I&rsquo;ve been dreaming for hours that I&rsquo;ve been late for work, as a result of watching TV and pissing around all day.   A small amusement park thing that I owned or was renting on someone else&rsquo;s land..</p>

<p><p class=dream>and I needed to get my dad&rsquo;s advice on something, but he wasn&rsquo;t available so I was relaxing outside, looking up at some apartments and a guy looked down and saw me and asked if I was going to watch the game and I was all no that I didn&rsquo;t have internet access.</p>

<p><p class=dream>then it just kept getttng later and later and more futile to go to work until it was six am the next day  and I was sill trying to go to work from monday though it was  six am tuesday now.   I had the feeling that I had to make it up, but finally I was just &ldquo;forget it&rdquo; and I told my dad my decision and woke up..</p>

<p><p>oh so relieved!</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p></p>

<p><P class=dream>I was at work, and Deborah was verifying that she had
our correct SSNs so that we could start having our checks direct
deposited into our accounts.  While she had the work financial numbers
near my desk, I noticed a line that said &ldquo;35 million shares
outstanding.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>&ldquo;Kevin,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;what is the deal with all these
shares?&rdquo;  &ldquo;Are there shares out there that no one can purchase?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>He was all, &ldquo;I have no control over what people can
buy.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>So I decided to do some reseearch to see why our 35
million shares were &lsquo;out there&rsquo; but not available for purchase.  Went
back to my work computer, where my computer mouse was in a tangle of
wires, reducing my productivity.. I felt rushed to get home before
Wende got home at 1pm cause I told her I would be at home.  In anger,
I yanked the mouse to try pulling its cord free of the other wires,
(it partially worked) and then I noticed it was already 1:20pm.</p>

<p><p class=dream>So I wrote a quick note to myself and on the screen:
&ldquo;Research IPOs&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>I grabbed two slices of pizza that were left on my desk
cause I felt like I shouldn&rsquo;t waste them.  I was munching one on the
way out the door, then I realized I was just about to eat lunch, and I
didn&rsquo;t have to &lsquo;save money&rsquo; by eating this pizza.  I mentally blessed
my life to be abundant enough to bring me food whenever I need it. I
threw the pizza into the trashcan on the way out of the building (big
open building with lots of windows and floors of dark roughly cut
rock) and I even spit out the piece that I had in my mouth.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Burst out into the parking lot (which happened to be
the parking lot of my old church) and there was Spot!  With intention
to scoop him up and take him hoome, I was all, &ldquo;Spot?&rdquo; but it wasn&rsquo;t
him.  So I zipped on past to my car.  Got in my car and the scene
melted into me being at home, and I woke up.</p>

<p><p>Today Wende is supposed to be home earlier than usual, about 4pm.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>playing ultimate and the game had just ended but I hadn't plalyed yet.   people were leaving  to go see movies.  then my brother walked up unexpected, wearing a big smile, "like I'm here; let's play ultimate!"

<p class=dream>People had just arrived and started to line up to play.  I was in great anticipation of playing against Fred, I expected he would be better player than me.

<p class=dream>As we waited to play, the field converted to the inside of a dorm room / shrine to Rocky Horror Picture Show.

<p class=note>(dream 2)</p>

<p><p class=dream>8.10am  in a bar type place with my dad, and getting food out of a vending machine.  not like candy, but entrees from the menu. I put in a penny, and the penny was not accepted, but the money counter would register a dime had been put in.  So we loaded the machine with a lot of pennies, bought a single burrito, and then had a bunch of extra golden dollars that I could hand out to people.  there was a little girl watching all of them come out, and she &lsquo;stole&rsquo; one (can you steal stolen money?) and I told her she could have it if she let me tell her about sacagawea and the coin and stuff.    then I woke up.  (is it stealing if I steal in my dream?)</p>

<p><p class=dream>Outside in a parking lot, Wende and I were unravelling a long water hose, which needed to connect from the McDonald&rsquo;s in the parking lot to wash her car.</p>

<p><p class=dream>The hose was in a cabin where we stayed while looking for our wedding spot, and we carried it across the parking lot then unrolled it.  The middle of the hose was hooked way up high on a small balcony above the parking lot.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Wende climbed up the hose in the shape of stairs to unhook it.  For a moment I had a view of her in middair standing way up high on a waterhose, .. just her silouhette against lovely blue sky background.</p>

<p><p class=dream>&ldquo;Wende!&rdquo;  I yelled up to her.  &ldquo;Stay there!  I wanna get your picture!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>As I looked around for my camera, I found it and loaded film into it, then realized it was a dream. and woke up.</p>

<p><p>Back a long time ago, like during high school and college and now, but not as often, I would have dreams that included finding money or rare coins.  In my dream I&rsquo;d be ecstatic, but then wake up and be totally &ldquo;DOH!&rdquo; and feel really gypped or tricked almost.</p>

<p><p>So now, whenever I dream about finding stuff, I&rsquo;m much faster to think, &ldquo;wait-a-minute!  is this a dream??&rdquo;  and check my dream state(*)</p>

<p><p>In the case above, I was thinking about having such beautiful photographs of Wende, and felt really blessed and excited to have them.  &ldquo;Wait-a-minute!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>(*) Check my dream state = test to see if I am actually dreaming.  <br>One technique is to try to fly.  If I can fly, I&rsquo;m dreaming.
<br> Another is to read something and then read it again.  If it changes, I&rsquo;m dreaming.
<br>Another technique is to know that if I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m dreaming or not, I&rsquo;m probably dreaming.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ve gotten a lot faster at recognizing when I&rsquo;m dreaming when the question pops into my head, but lately the question hasn&rsquo;t come to my mind.</p>
