<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>It had been a long time since I played anything at
KTRU, but I was going through my CDs and noticed that I had a CD that
KTRU used to have, but no longer had; the case was still there but the
CD was missing.  (This happens more often at KTRU than an honest DJ
might like)</p>

<p class=dream>The particular CD I found was one that I bought a long
time ago at Record Rack; I could tell because the price sticker was
still on the <em>face</em> of the CD instead of the back of the CD, or
even the case where it should be.  Plus the sticker said Record Rack
on it.</p>

<p class=dream>I put the CD on the turntable, which was behind some
bushes across from the elementary school on Decker Prairie-Rosehill
Road near my dad's house.  I chose the left hand turntable, instead of
the right hand one because the left hand one was about 1/2 a block
closer to where I had left my computer plugged in.</p>

<p class=dream>Put the CD in and played it while KTRU was actually
broadcasting a basketball game.  I didn't intend to broadcast it
<em>over</em> the basketball game, but just to preview it in the
studio.</p>

<p class=dream>I went back to looking through CDs while this one was
playing, and I suddenly realized I *might* be accidentally
broadcasting it over the game; I ran up to look and was horrified to
realize that's exactly what I had done.</p>

<p class=dream>I was surprised no one had called during this
apparently rebellious act; I hoped no one had heard it (that no one
was listening to the game), but I knew I must try to explain myself
and get it resolved before Rice Administration found out and tried to
shut down the station again.</p>

<p class=dream>Ran down the escalator out of the shopping mall/school,
wondering to whom I should address the email, and decided to just
write it to the KTRU email list, plus Will Robidee and Johnny So, the
most recent station manager that I knew of.  Summarized the points of
my letter in my mind: 1) that I was replacing a CD KTRU used to have,
2) that I hadn't DJed there in a while so I wasn't an official DJ and
all the blame could therefore be put on me and make a policy that
said, "no unofficial DJs allowed spinning records (which already is a
policy) and 3) that some other DJ had inappropriately left the volume
up and the red button pushed on the turntable input on the board.</p>

<p class=dream>I ran back toward the apartment where I was staying
with Amelia (Springfield) and she was just walking up to the outside
door at the same time.  I used my copy of her key and opened the
outside door, ran up the stairs and couldn't get the right key to open
the inside door, so I threw my keys down in disgust and waited for her
to open the door.  She did and the air conditioner guy was also just
walking in.</p>

<p class=dream>He looked at the thermostat and clicked the reset
button, saying, "there you go; all fixed," for we had been having a
problem with keeping the house warm enough.  I asked him calmly and
patiently what he thought was keeping the reset button needing to be
reset twice in two days (there must be an underlying issue, for which
this was simply a band-aid).  He agreed there must be something else
and would look into it for us.</p>

<p class=dream>While he looked, I stated flatly, "okay, I've
<em>got</em> to write this letter to KTRU" and went back to the desk
and pulled my computer out.  I was thankful that I had apparently
remembered it, but realized that I had forgotten the power supply and
would have to go back and get it.  Fortunately I would not need it
immediately; the battery was fully charged.</p>

<p class=dream>As I prepared to write, I remembered that I hadn't
actually written about the Godfather dream yet, and then realized that
hey this was a dream, and I *did* have the power supply for my
computer, and even better; I hadn't broadcast a song over the
basketball game on KTRU after all.</p>

<p>Ahhhhh.  such relief.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>With five other men from my men's group, or some men's
group (though Wende may have been one of them) we were in a house that
looked a lot like my dad's house, at least in the ceiling.  We needed
to paint the ceiling white.  With six people, I suggested we either
get into three teams of two or two teams of three, and I knew of a way
for each setup to work.  With three people per team, one person
paints, another person watches for missed spots, and another person
gets the missed spots, plus wipes up spots that shouldn't have been
painted (oh and the second person gets supplies as needed).</p>

<p class=dream>They thought this was a pretty good system, which I had
described while I was painting te ceiling with a broom, which worked
relatively well - long handle, bristles..</p>

<p class=dream>So I went outside to get a ladder to be the third person
and second combined by getting supplies because someone had gotten
paint on the wood paneled support beam at the top of the ceiling.</p>

<p class=dream>I went outside to the back yard and down a hill to get
my dad's extension ladder and first I just picked it up and threw it
down to see where any wasps may be on the thing so I could spray them
merceilessly and kill them (we don't have much compassion for wasps
around my dad's house) (not that anyone is allergic, bt there are just
plenty of wasps living in other places besides the ladder that I need
to use).</p>

<p class=dream>One wasp flew up and I could see a large pile of mud
indicating the location of mud dauber nests, so I went back inside to
get some Raid and a stick to knock off the mud.  (*)</p>

<p class=dream>Inside I found a stick and they were basically waiting
for me to get the ladder, so I ran back outside and used the stick to
spray Raid on the one wasp and it didn't die, but just flew away
before the Raid could get to it.</p>

<p class=dream>I used the stick to knock off the mud nests and most of
them broke off in one big chunk, and hopefully didn't die.</p>

<p class=dream>I tossed the ladder one more time to wake up anything
else there might be living on it, but nothing else moved.</p>

<p class=dream>So I brought the ladder inside and did not have to use
the extension to make it reach the celing with the paint on it.  But
the paint had already mostly dried so I had to use some alcohol
combined with wood colored dye to remove/cover up the white paint on
the wood at the top of the celiing.  (**)</p>

<p>(*) at this point I had actually woken up from my dream, but I just
wrote more in a sleepy state.</p>

<p>(**) at this point I fell asleep again.</p>

<p class=dream>Wende and I were at SWUUSI and I saw Bryn and her mom.
Grabbed Wende by the hand and ran up to Bryn.  "HI!" but she was
rather non-responsive.  So I told her I got her a guitar pin from Hard
Rock Cafe, and she didn't seem to want it.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class=dream>Saw some cats doing tricks on skateboards, jumping over
curbs and chain guardrails and such.  I decided I could do it and went
up to the top of the hill.</p>

<p class=dream>I got scared at first, and then recoginized it was a
dream.</p>

<p class=lucid>"This is a dream, just do a 360 over the chain."
Rolled down the hill and lept when I came near the curb, did a 360
counterclockwise over the curb and chain and landed with glee on the
other side.</p>

<p class=dream>Then we were inside a rather large, glass walled
elevator car, sitting along the sides of it, and the sliding elevator
doors didn't lead out of the elevator, but just to the elevator's own
entry way, which was in itself another elevator.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>Wende and one of her girl friends and I and two youth
were at SWUUSI.  We had our own cabin, away from all of the other
youth at SWUUSI.  I hadn't been to the past couple of events, so I was
unsure of everyone's name and kinda embarassed about that.  Unsure of
myself to go meet everyone cause I didn't know who I was supposed to
know and who I didn't.</p>

<p class=dream>I saw a square DVD on the coffee table so I tossed that
into the DVD player (looked like an old MAC Classic) and began to play
the video of some beach thing that had been held in Houston.</p>

<p class=dream>The light from the windows behind the TV were making it
really hard to see the TV so I used the remote control to close the
blinds on the windows.  Still too bright.  I closed the blinds the
other direction to see if that would effectively shift the light's
intrusion to the other end of the blinds.  No.</p>

<p class=dream>I started the movie and it was all touting the benefits
of sending your youth to YRUU; that YRUU benefits all who attend.</p>

<p>I woke up and realized that the light from the real sun was shining
in my eyes during my sleep.</p>

<p>I had a million dreams last night, some of which featured Jason
Fricke, Maia Cudhea, Sean Murray, Erick Morrow, Bryan Beck.  Fun to
get back to old school YRUU.</p>

<p class=dream>I was in an auto parts store and Jason called me from
the beach somewhere on the auto parts store phone.  He tried to
pretend he was someone else, "hey my car is broken down because of
parts you sold me."</p>

<p class=dream>I could tell it was him.  "Yeah, well, y'all just get
your car workin' again, drive it on down here and we'll take a
look."</p>

<p class=dream>"You drive your store up here and bring me the right
parts."</p>

<p class=dream>"We're sending a helicopter now to come take a look.
Just sit tight."</p>

<p class=dream>"No, I dont want a helicopter. Send a train or a
tricked out school bus with 50 inch speakers kicking Frank Black and
Madonna duet of Marilyn Mason and 2 Pac songs."</p>

<p class=dream>"Okay; it's on its way."</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>On a road trip, I went back to Bloomington, staying in
a garage apartment at the same address as Maggie and Molly's house.  I
felt all sad like, "what am I doing here?" and was crying when I came
from the store where Barb was working, but when I opened the door,
some other traveler was in the room as well.</p>

<p class=dream>"When did you get here?"</p>

<p class=dream>"Not so long ago."  She had a guitar on the floor
beside her.</p>

<p class=dream>"I felt like I don't know what the hell I'm doing here,
that's why I was crying."</p>

<p class=dream>"Me too."</p>

<p class=dream>"Girl, give me a hug."</p>

<p class=dream>And we hugged, knowing the angst and trauma the other
may be experiencing.  So great to find a fellow traveler.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>Back at Emerson Church, we were having a ceremony for
some of the graduating seniors, including Zach Wood.  Anyone who
wanted to speak positively of him was able to do so.</p>

<p class=dream>I ended up first in line, even though I figured
advisors shouldn't go first, but be somewhere near the end, cause of
all people advisors probably know them best except for family (and in
some cases, more than family)</p>

<p class=dream>I carried a candle, which was more like a sparkler, but
only the tip was glowing and not throwing sparks everywhere, but the
tip kinda looked like a sphere as the actual wire of the sparkler
curved like the longitude lines on a globe near the top to make a
ball, and the very tip was glowing hot.</p>

<p class=dream>I walked slowly down the aisle from the back of the
church and the congregation was huge, like some thousand people
chillin' in the pews.  I was encouraged to speak quickly; there were a
lot of people behind me, including my brother, who was next in line.</p>

<p class=dream>"Um, Zach was really energetic when he was in The
Schweitzer Club back in the day.  And for that age group to be
outgoing with only a few peers is really amazing."</p>

<p class=dream>Everyone in the audience seemed to agree and I walked
back to the back of the congregation for I had just arrived and my
stuff was still back there.</p>

<p class=dream>I looked back over the front of the congregation and
could see a sign on a big building across the street from the church
like, "BIG BUSINESS BOUGHT THE BANK TO HAVE MORE POWER" and I cocked
my head over to Fred, "hey man, you see that sign?"</p>

<p class=dream>Then I heard some sort of commotion going on up front.
Someone was yelling <em>screaming</em> like a bad commercial, running
around the congregation hollering, "buy some watches, we got jewelry,
diamonds, anything you want a crazy low prices"</p>

<p class=dream>And he was so disruptive and inappropriate that I
started to run after him, slowly at first, but then building up great
speed, and he took off, still yelling his little spiel, and I barely
missed him as he did a little evasive move and ran another direction.
I reoriented myself and ran up the aisle to him and this time my
brother was also after him and the guy and Fred collided and went
sprawling onto the ground.</p>

<p class=dream>I got to him and it was the stapler guy from Office
Space flat on his back, so I pulled his glasses off to effectively
disable him, and I was all "you don't do that in a <em>church</em>,
man! You could tell we didn't want you here yelling like that and you
still did it.  And I was running <em>fast</em>; I only caught you
cause you tripped over Fred, man, what were you <em>thinking?</em></p>

<p class=dream>We carried him by grabbing his clothes, like a grabbed
his buttons up near his collar, and Fred grabbed his beltline and we
carried him up the aisle out of the church to a waiting ambulance that
had just been called.</p>

<p class=dream>I wondered about the wisdom of having moved an injured
person, but oh well, nothing to be done about that now, and hefted him
up onto the gurney in the ambulance.  A nurse helped him get situated
on the stretcher and he suddenly opened his eyes and kinda woke up
incredulously, "I'm not dead?" as if he imagined himself all bloodied
and broken from the fall.</p>

<p class=dream>I thought, "man you've never even fallen before to know
that you're just fine."</p>

<p>Then I heard a noise and woke up.</p>

<p class=note>(4am dream)</p>

<p class=dream>Driving on a road that had been just freshly poured,
like fresh asphalt had just been layed down where previously there was
only grass and a forest, I felt so bad for the animals who would be
cut off from their buds on the other side of the road,   but I was
forced to use this road for some reason to get someplace I had been to
before using other roads in the past.</p>

<p class=dream>On the map the roadway system looked like a big loop
with a diagonal stripe through it, where the diagonal was the new
road.</p>

<p>There was far more to this dream, and I thought, 'oh I'll remember
it.'</p>

<p>False.</p>

<p class=note>(7am dream)</p>

<p class=dream>In a small cabin type thing which was a medical
research lab as well.  With a guy who I just recently met, and a woman
researcher/nurse was there as well.  There had been mosquitos biting
us earlier and she talked about some diseases that could be carried by
mosquitos during certain times of the year, and that three years ago
ended a few year stretch where bewtween June 20 and July 4th, people
(especially babies) could get a disease from a mosquito bite.</p>

<p class=dream>She told us that there had been an immunization for it
and that the outbreak didn't happen much anymore.  But that she was
interested in seeing if we had the immunization genese in our DNA.</p>

<p class=dream>She told us, 'here each of you give me a DNA sample in
these cups,' told us to just turn around and each masturbate into a
cup.  People started walking in before I finished so I was all trying
to get some privacy, but I couldn't ever get a private moment long
enough to complete this project.</p>

<p class=dream>Someone walked in so I pulled my pants up, and it was
Meg Robinson who came in and I had been laying down behind the counter
in the dark, and she was all, "oh, you got hit in the balls; I hate
when that happens.." and ducked back out.</p>

<p class=dream>Then another girl was all, "can you help me?" and had
all this hair care products or something and I gave up my little
project and was all, "um sure"</p>

<p class=dream>Before I helped her, I was all, "you know what's
weird?"</p>

<p class=dream>"what?"</p>

<p class=dream>"today I just met Tony Hawk"</p>

<p class=dream>"!!!!"</p>

<p class=dream>"And it was no big deal to me.  I was just all 'HI
Tony, nice to meet you.'"</p>

<p class=dream>"YOU <em>MET</em> TONY HAWK????"</p>

<p class=dream>"I can see from your reaction that you would have been
a bit more excited about meeting him..  Anyway, I was just like, meh
and didn't really get excited at all.  Why do we individuals each have
different celebrities that make us really excited to meet them?"</p>

<p class=dream>Driving up a mountain, Sally and I were helping to hold
the highway together, like reinforcing it with big metal plates,
attaching them to rocks and such to make sure that nothing would fall
apart, so that the freeway below would not collapse under its own
weight and slide down or break off the mountain.</p>

<p class=dream>Headlines on TV that we had just engaged in military
battle with Iraq, watching a plane fly in and launch a missle, and
watching the missle as it rocketed across the landscape and finally
detonated near a lot of people and then I was with all the guys from
the Wolf Shop, up on a platform with the bad guys all around us.</p>

<p class=dream>Joe was down below, throwing lines of staples up to us
so that we could use them to fight in hand to hand combat, or put them
on the bottom of our shoes and kick.  Then all the bad guys were
walking away and some other crew of women was walking in to help us
fight.  We came down the stairs because our shift was being relieved
and one of the women took our picture to verify that we were okay.
Her left breast had been naked, so she covered it up with her hand
when she took the picture so as to not distract us.</p>

<p class=dream>She gave me the picture (taken with a polaroid) and
though I had specifically not looked at her breast when the picture
was taken, I was looking down in the picture.  Our faces were all
covered in shoe polish as camoflauge.</p>
