<div class="dream">I had a schedule conflict that I detected a few
days out, but didn't try to rectify until the day of the conflict.
Nate wanted to have me join a late night adventure sneaking into a
dark house that only I knew the layout to find some prize close to
midnight.</div>

<div class="dream">I was more interested in joining Lin to meet Travis
and Yumi for a roadtrip that started at 11pm, but planned to meet in
nearly the same location, an empty field next to the building that
Nate and I were going to explore in the dark.</div>

<div class="dream">I was more interested in joining Lin and Travis
because they wanted me to join because of me, and Nate wanted me to
join because of what I could do.</div>

<div class="dream">I decided I had to call Nate, so I found my phone
and my earphones and plugged them into the phone and into my ears.  I
called him while walking around a mall near a train station, going up
and down escalators and was like</div>

<div class="dream">"Hey yo I gotta leave early tonight like
midnight,"</div>

<div class="dream">and he goes "Why?"</div>

<div class="dream"> Which is a question I had not really anticipated.
I told him why and he seemed to understand because he repeated back
what I said.  I was like yep and he started to negotiate as I walked
down an escalator barefoot and turned right after I saw some people go
down a vertical elevator thing like in a parking garage I saw where
the staff could use the elevator chains that just continuously cycled.
I was surprised that I didnt want to take that but instead took the
escalator, thinking next time I would take the elevator chain.</div>

<p>I woke up quite relieved that there was no schedule conflict..</p>

<p class="dream"> We watched as two security guards dove into the
river to help the tourists who had fallen out of the rafts.  The river
water came right up to the window, which surprised me, but was normal
to the locals.  We started climbing down the tower and walking towards
the rocket to launch to the mon.  I was like oh snap I forgot to pack!
I realized I did not have to panick; I manifested the packed bag in my
hands by visualizing what needed to be in it.  This action woke me
into waking reality but I went back to sleep.  Walking along the path
with my new friend, we saw one of her friends who gave me doe eyes
when we met. Nice to meet you and hug and kiss with the idea of more
to come.</p>

<p class="dream">Seeing the map of the town and the friendly history,
I just started crying, "I wish I had found you 3 years ago."</p>

<p class="dream">I was a little bit confused on the train as it went through a tunnel, I realized the train was different than other trains.  It was longer, like one continuous car as it snaked along the route.  The seat next to me was available, so I patted on it to invite the guy sitting on the other side of the empty seat to sit closer.  He ignored me, but I had made the offer, so that was good enough.</p>

<p class="dream">In the train station, I realized it was a little different because we had arrived at 3F instead of 2F.  I was hungry so went to a shop.  I wanted to get something a bit healthy so I settled on a tuna sandwich with wheat bread.  One of the cashiers was checking out a customer, so I took the sandwich to the other cashier, and then realized she wasn't a cashier because she wasn't wearing a uniform.  She assured me my initial guess was correct: she *was* a cashier and was happy to help.</p>

<p class="dream">I didn't have any money, so I used an 1/8th of the tuna sandwich.  I gave it to her and she placed it on a scale.  It was worth twice what the sandwich had cost, so I was like "d'oh! I over estimated." I wondered if she would give me half of the 1/8th back, or give me currency back.</p>

<p>In waking reality, Lin woke up to let Jennie inside which woke me up
and I realized the dream was interesting enough to jot down.</p>

<p class="dream">Driving Mr Van with some friends, including Natalie
from PB, I learned that one of my friends was able to start Mr Van
with a lockpick key that worked very easily.  He wanted to drive, but
because he wasn't on our insurance, I said it was illegal and asked
him not to.</p>

<p class="dream">He distracted me with a puzzle and then when I looked
up, I disocvered he was driving the van! I was pissed!  I was like
"Stop the Van Right Now How The Fuck you think you can drive the Van
after I TOLD you very Clearly Not to!" and then was a bit more sane
and let him speak, but I assured him I had mentioned insurance and it
being illegal.</p>

<p class="dream">Other people in our group felt unsafe as a result of
my outburst, so I invited each person to clear with me whatever they
were feeling.  One of the women said she wanted to speak, but then
sent her daughter with a lawn sprinkler to spray water on people,
including me.</p>

<p class="dream">I went back into the van when the girl started
spraying some old man who was not even part of our group.  "Uh yeah so
I heard you wanted to say something, but I just got sprayed with
water; was there anything specific you wanted to say?"</p>

<p class="dream">No one else wanted to say anything, so I just ate
some grapes or whatever was at the table where they were eating buffet
style.  Then Kim Sawyer was there and I planned to tell him I had lost
it at a guy to get his input, but then Lin woke me up.</p>

<p class='dream'>Was at someone's house like family reunion and  wanted to get away
from it all</p>

<p class='dream'>Girl was beautiful but couldn't skateboard, and we took the time to
teach her to skateboard.  She went from zero ability to basically
being able to skate.  I gave her a congratulations hug and kiss at the
end and she thanked me for taking time to help her learn.</p>

<p class='dream'>So I was all alone in the narrow bathroom (my shouldrs could touch /
were compressed between the wall and the glasss door, and I was
brushing my teeth and crying a little.  Mama saw me and was like "yo
man you gota brush your teeth proudly outside" and made a big show of
how it was important to be proud, etc.  I called her stupid stupid
stupid and then said sorry, but then was like, "oh yeah well what's
the difference between cleaning my teeth alone and you washing your
face alone or trimming your moustace hair alone?" and she got all
quiet and other people were like "what's up?" and I go "Mama wants me
to brush my teeth outside, but I don't see her logic," to one guy and
then we both said at the same time, "because there is none."</p>

<p class='dream'>Then Lin was committing some changes to a repository at her work, and
I was helping her with that</p>

<h2 id="06-39">06:39</h2>

<p class='dream'>Oh, also I dreamt there were some guys playing frisbee out in a big
field; I joined them and we threw for a while.  Some of my ultimate
friends came and asked if we were going to play ultimate, and I said I
didn't know, but was just going to throw and be happy.</p>

<p>Going back to sleep for a bit.</p>

<p class="dream">
My dragon arrived, and it was much larger than expcected! I helped the
UPS driver deliver it. There were a few light things but then some
pieces we had to carry together.  First was a large mirror, though it
was covered in fabric.  The tires were like truck tires which I
suggested a game to roll up the driveway together.  She agreed after
realizing I would help carry things, and wasn't just fooling around.
</p>

<p class="dream">
The dragon playground had a working toilet, but I hadn't planned to
install plumbing because I didn't know about it.  The driver thought
it would be good if someone with kids had bought the dragon, but I
told her we don't have kids; the dragon was for me.

Dreamt I was sparring with Sae in karate; I got one point on her after
a while, which was a surprise because she knows what she's doing and I
know nothing of karate.</div>

<div class="dream">
Colleen and another tall girl were playing basketball against two
young kids, easily beating them so I joined the little kids' team to
help even the game.  Colleen jumped onto my back to slow me down, but
I still while lying down on the sidelines, trying to throw the ball to
the smaller kids. Eventually I was able to get up and do slam dunks
with Colleen piggybacking me; I was pretty impressed, but I figured my
body had just gotten used to having my heavy backpack all the time and
Colleen was no heavier.
