<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was in gymnastics class, happy to be
back and bouncy bouncing on the runway trampoline.
There was some sort of competition, or just a time to
show our skills.  My name was called (along with Mark
W from ultimate) and I climbed onto the runway
trampoline.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was able to do a branny (front flip
with half twist), but not able to do bigger stuff
because I kept bottoming-out the trampoline (hitting
the floor below), effectively stopping my bounces.</p>

<p><p class=dream>The coach lifted a corner of the
trampoline to give me more room to bounce, but then
the tramp was all shaky, and I wasn&rsquo;t comfortable with
the lack of balance.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>for a while I dreamt I was typing all this.  trying to
memorize my dream while thinking I was typing, but not typing. I was sleeping.</p>

<p><p class=dream>melted into sleep and then another dream.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Setting up our new house which was one story and I had Wende&rsquo;s three witching balls which (no pun intended) are designed to capture evil spirits who get entranced by the spiderweb like strands of glass inside the ball.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was blessing one of the balls for my room and Wende came in and we talked about where to put them</p>

<p><p class=dream>scene melted into assembly of youth watching movie about a man who had 10000 dollars and was tyring to make himself popular.  A confrontation in the movie and then movie over, youth walking from the big movie screening room along an outdoor hallway like a school and one youth lit up a cigarette.</p>

<p><p class=dream>same energy of the movie, but at camp outside.  and the scene transformed into
outside at a campground, with Maia and Tiffany at SWUUSI probably, and
I was in a car maybe Mr Van at the bottom of a ramp and a the man from the movie was at
the top of the ramp in a car as if he were about to drive down and
kill soemeone, but we didn&rsquo;t know who.  The sense was that this was a
soap opera movie, so his plan was clear (kill someone) but we didn&rsquo;t know
who.  I yelled up to him HI! and he asked yelled back a question and I
climbed up the structure to see what he wanted and he asked if i had
ever driven down this big ramp and down the hill and i said i had done
it on skates before.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I confronted him; who are you planning to kill or planning to and he
halfway confessed and I said don&rsquo;t do it and got down and then he
drove to the bottom of the the ramp (not down the entire hill) and he
stabbed my cousin Peter in the upper right shoulder blade.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was all &ldquo;Call 911!!&rdquo;  and I called 991 at first and the operator
said, &ldquo;you dialed it wrong&rdquo; and hung up and then I dialed correctly
and the guy answered &ldquo;fire, police or ambulance?&rdquo; and I was all, &ldquo;um..
police&rdquo; but they took forever to answer the phone.  As I was waiting
for them to answer, two people were tryng to pin the guy down.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I went over (they never answered) and someone was using stakes, like
long tent stakes, they were pinning his jacket to the ground.  Jason
was going to kill him by stabbing trhough the back of his neck, and I
yelled, NO as the guy was now calm.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I had a thick cord cord thing and was going to restrain his head
against the ground like a big horse bit and he was all very compliant,
but kept getting out from under it.  I had this cable thing stabbed
significantly far into the sand, and pulled hard against his mouth and
then was stabbbing it into the sand on the other side, but he kept
getting out somehow.  The entire time I was talking to him, all, &ldquo;sir
you need to lay back down&rdquo; and he would comply, talking about some
other aspect</p>

<p><p class=dream>stabbing the cable arms&rsquo; length  into the  ground I finally was starting to get the guy caught for good and use coat hangars on the other side to make it tighter.  problem solved essentially and I woke up</p>

<p class=note>dream</p>

<p><p class=dream>We were at my cousin Bridgette&rsquo;s house and several kids were over and her son Matt had to hurl.  He didn&rsquo;t make it to the bathroom the first time.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Bridgette cleaned it up and then the kids were all playing in the room again and the room was all messy with toys everywhere.. Me and Bridgette were in there and Matt was all, &ldquo;um, mom, uh oh.&rdquo; and jumped up into the bathroom.</p>

<p><p class=dream>He hurled into the toilet (presumably; I didn&rsquo;t look) and then fell asleep in there as his bunk was also in the bathroom apparently.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I noticed that he didn&rsquo;t flush, and I was walking away and told Nick, who was walking around with Annie that he hadn&rsquo;t flushed.  It was more Nick&rsquo;s house than my house so he was all, &ldquo;Okay I&rsquo;ll take care of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p class=note>dream</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was at KTRU playing some vinyl and the microphone was..  well the dj console was up like on a taller table and the turntables up on that.  I played some hip hop on vinyl and then was going to play something in stark contrast to that, but I realized I had already played it.   Wende was there so I was all &ldquo;Go grab a CD&rdquo; and then on the air, &ldquo;My helper is grabbing a CD for me&rdquo; and she grabbed a fanfold Christmas card, which unfolded off the shelf as she grabbed it.</p>

<p><p class=dream>&lsquo;Good enough&rsquo; I thought.  &ldquo;We shall now read this lovly Christmas card.&rdquo;  The few people in the station (my friends) who were watching clapped politely.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Wende started reading the first panel of the card, &lsquo;from 1890 to 1990&rsquo; and was reading reading reading .. and the card became like a long chain link thing suspended across the room, and was also the microphone that peole would speak into as they read.  Someone else had  became the first reader (no longer Wende) who was now the second reader reading so much long long stuff and I found that my jaw had locked up (did not trigger that it must be a dream, but I did force it unlocked (as I type, it doesn&rsquo;t feel sore)) and noticed that people were not speaking loudly enough into the microphone chain link thing.  They were all distracted with different parts of the story and I tried to cover for them, telling the radio audience what was going on and trying to get back to the story.</p>

<p><p class=dream>My voice was all strained like stereotypical &ldquo;stuffy rich Mr Howell voice&rdquo; (that didn&rsquo;t enter my head in the dream, but I&rsquo;m using it to describe now)  and I was tryiing to speak, but not very effectively.</p>

<p><p class=dream>Tried to attract someone else to read the third portion, but then I realized it might as well be me; it&rsquo;s my show.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was reading the christmas card from 1790 to 1890 and began not reading but describing the picture in front of me.  that&rsquo;s what had been taking so long; pepople weren&rsquo;t reading, but simply describing the scene over the air. (requiring a thousand words for every scene, heehee)</p>

<p><p class=dream>and I was describing these monogrammed aprons up on a shelf, what names were on them and I began to forget about my mouth being tight (I think it loosened up when I overcame the tense situation of people not speaking loudly enough and I was no longer concerned for my audience)</p>

<p><p>and I woke up.   It&rsquo;s 5:00am</p>

<p class=note>(dreams)</p></p>

<p><p>Wende and I were in the car listening to the radio at about 3am.
Listening to 104KRBE and Sam Malone was just arriving into the station.
We arrived at the station and I was going to go say HI to him and try
to get free tickets and stuff.</p>

<p><p>We pulled into the parking lot, facing some tennis courts, and the
station was behind us in the parking lot in a small one-or-two room
building.</p>

<p><p>I told Wende I would just be a second, when I went in, and that she
could just stay in teh car.  As I said this, I knew it wasn&rsquo;t going to
take only a second, though..</p>

<p><p>I went inside and the radio station was KTRU, not KRBE and Sarah P
(KTRU&rsquo;s current DJ Director) was the DJ at the moment.</p>

<p><p>She was playing some various tunes and then played the audio
portion of a billiards game that was being shown on a small TV in the
station.  The billiards playrs weren&rsquo;t doing all that well, and I asked
if I could make fun of them on the air.  She said no, that wouldn&rsquo;t be
in line with KTRU&rsquo;s mission.</p>

<p><p>She went over toward the kitchen (the station was looking more like
a house (large screen TV to the right of the DJ console, kitchen to
the right (TV to the left)) and all the records and CDs in the living
room.</p>

<p><p>She came back with her cat and asked if I would be scared of it,
because it was actually a snake.  I was like, snakes no problem, but
then I could see its head was triangular in shape (like a venomous
snake) and she said it was venomous, but didn&rsquo;t usually bite people.</p>

<p><p>I was suddenly quite scared to hold it, but by that time, it had
already snaked its way onto my arm and kinda hooked its body around my
back.  Sarah was trying to pull it off, but the snake was enjoying my
body heat and didn&rsquo;t want to go.</p>

<p><p>I was nervous/scared the entire time that it would strike me, but
she finally got it off and put it on the ground, where it reformed
into a cat around my feet.  I was standing at the DJ console trying to
play records and stuff, while shifting my feet around trying to keep
this cat-snake from rubbing its head agains my leg.</p>

<p><p>Finally Sarah came back and took the cat back to wherever it had
been.</em></p>

<p><p>- - - - other dream  - &ndash;</p>

<p><p><em>My dad and Wende were at the radio station with me, this stime
during my shift, and Wende cued up a song on CD, Madonna&rsquo;s &ldquo;Crazy For
You&rdquo;.  I told her that she had done a fine job of cueing it up.</p>

<p><p>While I was praising her cueing skills, the song ended, and I had
nothing else cued up ready to go.  Instead of going on mic and saying,
&ldquo;oops bad DJ didn&rsquo;t have a song ready to go&rdquo; or something (as I
normally would do) I just let the next song play as I went to look in
the stacks for a good CD.</p>

<p><p>I found A CD by Asphodel (that is a record label name actually) and
slammed the song on top of the current Madonna song that was playing.</em></p>

<p><p><em>kT and I were in my new house hanging out and the house was my
parents old house but it was somehow given to me to live in .  The
house had been moved to some new land.</p>

<p><p>We were waiting for Anna to come by and we were going to say
goodbye to her before she goes off to the wild blue yonder in Canada.
kT caled Anna and was talking to her about possible coming over to say
HI.  Anna was an hour away and it was late, but she said she would
drive over and be there in an hour.</p>

<p><p>I was going to sleep for an hour and told kT to wake me up when Anna
got there.</p>

<p><p>I went into my parent&rsquo;s master bedroom and was amazed how how
truly big it was.  the closets were the size of rooms and all their
old stuf was in shelves.  I recognized I had been living there for a
while, but hadn&rsquo;t actually used a or seen all the rooms int he house.</p>

<p><p>Back behind the closet was the bathroom and behind that a hottub
and jaccuzzi type thing.  Behind that was a room dedicated just to
model trains.  There was an O-scale train set half built, but abandoned
during construction.  There was a completed train set outside the
window, but it had been neglected after it was built.</p>

<p><p>We were drawing pictures for Anna in a hurried fashion before she
arrived an hour later.  kT had already started on one on a white
napkin, but I wanted to find some paper.  I remembered where paper had
been, but it didn&rsquo;t seem to be there anymore&hellip;  Finally I found some
that would do - it was hidden in with my last year&rsquo;s Youth Council
stuff.</p>

<p><p>I gave some sheets to kT to draw on, and then I was going to nap.</p>

<p><p>I was at Elizabeth Gammell&rsquo;s house, just before she was going to go
on vacation, and I was just visiting and wanted to use a pillow in her
dining room to just to rest my head.  I curled up on the floor to
sleep, and woke up.</em></p>

<div class="dream">

I had parked my car in a parking lot that was a guys yard where
we had all parked every day for a long time.  When I went back to get
my car, the gas tank was open and a piece of plastic bag was stuck in
the gas tank hole.  I went back into the school (dorms) and started
knocking on doors to see if anyone knew what had happened to my cars
gas cap.

Finally a dude was willing to help and he assumed that I had tried
to start my car.  I had not, and I went back outside to start my car,
but my car was gone.

I was mad and banged on the door, actually I knocked gently but I
thought about banging, and I asked the guy what happened to my car.
He said it had been towed, but came out there with me to listen to me
describe the car and where it had been parked by a tree and that it
had new tires.  He seemed very understanding, but didn't seem as if I
would get my car back.

Then, I saw the clock that I had in my car.  The clock was digital
and broken into 3 pieces on the ground, and I just started wailing
crying huge huge un controllable tears of sadness as I picked up the
clock and shoed him and pantomimed to him how the pieces fit together
and how it had all been taped to the dashboard of my car and I was SO
SAD about having lost it.
</div>

<p><p>Then a weird thing happened: in my dream my jaw locked shut; I
could not open my mouth. I&rsquo;ve experienced having my jaw locked in a
dream before, but never had experienced a continuous dream sequence
from not having it locked, to having it locked.  A couple years ago
(during UH days) is when I first became aware of it happening, and
I&rsquo;ve slowly come to recognize that each time my jaw locks up, I <em>must</em>
be dreaming.  In my dream</p>

<div class="dream">
I started to force my jaw open, sticking both hands in my mouth
to pry my teeth apart.  I did this a few times until it got easier and
easier to open.
</div>

<p>I ultimately woke up before any more interesting
dream stuff happened.</p>

<div class="dream">
Wende and I were living in an old old house that had been built
back in the day when the island we were on was dominated by black
plague, with thousands of people dying.  All of that was over, and we
were in Jamaica, going through our house, trying to turn off all the
lights in the house because Wende had found an old flashlight that
barely glowed when she turned it on.  We turned off all the lights and
could see the glow of the flashlight, but then we would find one more
light that was on.  We kept trying to find the switch for this light,
but couldn't find it.  There were about 12 switches in the room, many
of which were labeled.  The switch styles were all different shapes
and different colors.  None of the switches turned off the light we
were interested in.  Some of them turned on lights, and some seemed to
do nothing at all.

Wende found a board game that had been published just after the
black plague had left the island, kindof as a history lesson to kids
so they could understand that thousands of people had died and were
all buried in the center of the island in pits.  The game consisted of
characiture portraits of famous people with messed up teeth or messed
up glasses, and the real story describing the person with his or her
flaws.  We looked through a few of the cards, but got bored and I woke up.

<p class=note>(Dreams)</p>

<p><p>(1)</p>

<p><p class="dream">I was arrested for creating a nuisance, and disturbing the peace
in a small town, but the arrest was somehow a joke (on whom, I don&rsquo;t
know, cause I was in on it), so they still let me go to Australia and
even gave me $500 calling card so I could check in each day.</p>

<p><p>I don&rsquo;t remember much more detail of this dream&hellip;</p>

<p><p>(2)</p>

<p><p class="dream">I was at General Assembly which was in Salt Lake City
in a hotel.</p>

<p><p class="dream">A minister came to watch some youth who were up late late playing
with those little paddle with ball on rubber string things (what&rsquo;s it
called?)  and she (minister) asked me what was the point of the game?
I explained how if the ball was thrown, it would be snapped back by
the rubber string, thereby allowing the person to try to hit it.</p>

<p><p class="dream">These were crazy long rubber strings though, stretching all the way
to the ceiling of the gymnasium and attached there, then back down,
so it was more like the ball was a bouncing swinging pendulum that
youth were trying to hit with the paddle (which was also attached to
the same point in the ceiling via rubber string).</p>

<p><p class="dream">Fricke was there, with his own wacky version of the game, where the
rubber string was all wrapped around his body and then would come
spiraling off and sling in some random direction.</p>

<p><p class="dream">I went to bed, but then saw Melissa (from OKC)
and she was all, &ldquo;want to go get some breakfast?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class="dream">&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class="dream">&ldquo;How about at Crystal Palace?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class="dream">So we hopped in her car and she drove us away from the
hotel toward the Crystal Palace, where we had GA the previous year.</p>

<p><p class="dream">I didn&rsquo;t recognize the buildings 100%, but they were the streets of
Boston (or was it Chicago?) and kept on driving until the city
abruptly arrived at a large wooden pier, drove way out onto it, and
waited for people to get out of the way so we could turn right onto a
narrower pier thing.  Drove a bit, then turned right again and
actually 2 tires went off the side of the pier (Melissa&rsquo;s side) and I
freaked a bit, she was all, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s no problem&rdquo; and sure enough, once
she got around the little obstruction she had avoided, we drove back
all four tiers onto the pier.</p>

<p><p class="dream">Then we were there at the Crystal Palace, which was a small Chinese
seafood restaurant on this pier.  We were parked under their porch
awning thing and the busboy looked out the window and I was all ,&ldquo;is
this your valet parking?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class="dream">&ldquo;Actually it&rsquo;s all the way on the other side of the pier.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class="dream">Well is there somewhere close we can park?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class="dream">He pointed to a spot that was just behind us, where we would no
longer be under their awning.  &ldquo;Parallel parking right there.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class="dream">Melissa was all, &ldquo;can you parallel park?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class="dream">After you were able to drive 2 wheels off the pier and back on,
you can&rsquo;t parallel park? I thought to myself.  &ldquo;Um yeah.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class="dream">Then the guy was all, &ldquo;do you want us to get some soup for you
while you move the car?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class="dream">I was all, &ldquo;um, yeah water is fine,&rdquo; assuming he had asked about
drinks.</p>

<p><p class="dream">Melissa was all, &ldquo;no, what kind of soup do you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class="dream">They showed me the options, and they were all named after first
names of movie stars and cartoon characters &ldquo;Elmer&rdquo; Cheetoh, Howard
Louis, Buster, Maynard - there was about 50 options.  I recognized
there was no description,and was I just supposed to see which name I
liked best?</p>

<p><p>and I woke up.</p>

<p><p class="dream">I was at work and there was a phone call for Kevin.  I almost
picked it up, thinking it was for me.  It was Christine!!  She was on
speaker phone and was all, &ldquo;Kevin, this is Christine and was just
calling to tell you blah blah blah &ldquo; and I was all freakin&rsquo; because
two reasons: 1) I really wanted to talk to her and 2) Her ex-boyfriend
happened to be at my work too, and I didn&rsquo;t want him to hear her on
the phone cause he really hates her.</p>

<p><p class="dream">I was looking for the HOLD button, but couldn&rsquo;t find it and she
just kept talking about me.. About how I was such a great friend and
had done all these cool things etc.  (Christine routinely promotes her
friends to other friends in her continuous networking between people)</p>

<p><p class="dream">I finally found the hold button and then picked up the phone again
so I could hear her, but her old b/f kept like trying to follow me
around, trying to listen as well.  I didn&rsquo;t dare say anything because
I didn&rsquo;t want him to know how happy I was to hear from her.</p>

<p><p class="dream">Finally Kevin picked up and was talking to her in the other room
and I wrote him an email to see if he could give me her number.</p>

<p><p class="dream">Kevin&rsquo;s computer was not on his desk, but on the floor as he was
making way for his new computer to come in..</p>

<p><p class="dream">I decided to email the request to Kevin, but as I was watching my
monitor, it turned into a TV showing an old Texas A&amp;M football game
against the Houston Oilers.  The game was classic because the field
was covered in 4 feet of water!  The scene showed the QB dropping
back to toss and he stumbles just as he throws the ball and it is not
caught, but neither is it down because the ball never touched the
ground.  An A&amp;M player thrashed away from Oiler defenders and got the
ball, swimming huge fast strokes, half running half modified butterfly
stroke.  He swam astonishingly fast (they all were) and made the
touchdown, winning the game.</p>

<p><p class="dream">My point of view had melted into the screen so I was <em>at</em> the game
and totally cheering for them/him.</p>

<p><p="dream">And then I was back at work, and something else and I woke up.</p>
