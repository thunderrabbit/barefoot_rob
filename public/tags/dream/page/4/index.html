<p class="dream">
With SBK and her twin sister, we had a big bed together and I got to
sleep with both at the same time, with the door open, and we heard
some noise during fellatio with SBK twin, so I got up and bumped the
door closed without leaving the bed and came back and SBK began
fellatio and I joked like "hey you're cutting in line; let's kiss," and
twin went back to fellatio and I kissed SBK for a few seconds,
relishing the moment until it changed as Steve came over to put away
his blanket, and I considered gently rushing him out, but I hadn't
seen him in a while so I said he could just put the blanket anywhere
would be fine.  Unfortunately the moment with twins had passed and I
went looking for them, but found only  some people who wanted to have
me proofread an article, and I laughed at the note about the author
having received 892,023? (just under 900,000, I rememeber) text messaged
correctoons or nquiries hahah so that's why they didn't reply
</p>

<p>then my alarm went off.</p>

<p>Next to some train tracks with Lin, I wanted to hop on the next train
to see where it would go, but we needed to go somewhere.  The next
train tat came through stoped so I could watch and actually split some
cars off and sent them toward a deep rock quarry with limestone
boulders precariously falling from the other side and occasionally
bouncing onto tis side.  A guy on the train rode his bicycle down th
square spiralled tracks and narrowly missed being crushed by a
limestone boulder.  I did the same (not be crushed) by watching the
boulders peel away from the other side, and predicting their paths
while they were in the air  after looping down and back up.</p>

<p>Superman and Batman were at odds; Batman was the good guy, but
Superman was helping the bad guy destroy the city by flying his jet
directly down into the ground and having the despondent guy fly down
alongside him, but Batman realized in time and flew to catch the plane
and diverted it upwrrd and then unarguably changed the course of
history.   We just don&rsquo;t know from what.</p>

<p>After the jet was diverted to crash not in the city, I was sitting on
a hilltop looking for it.  Somewone had super-zoomed my cameras and
found it, so I becan to showe people as I zoomed out. after I had seen
the pilot alive and well, though in a destroyed plane.</p>

<p>Two types of monsters existed in the city which had existed for
thousands of years and recently we realized they had found a weakness
in our defenses.  We had secured some way that disallowed them from
climbing up this set of buildings but they had found a way to beat
that with a new building which had been built recently, so they could
climb up the new buildng above the defenses and the swing across to
our set of buildings.</p>

<p>A small porcupine monster came up through a hole in the
sidewalk and was spewing pencils upward; I used some of the pencils to
attack it, stabbing downward through the hole so he couldn&rsquo;t come up.</p>

<p>He asked if I stabbed him 562 times with 562 pencils how many stabs
that would be, and I said just 562, one per pencil.  I closed the hole
with a rock and believed he couldn&rsquo;t get up past it, given all his
injuries.</p>

<p>I went up to the house and told one housemate the problem with the
monsters being able to reach the city and that the roommate shoud be
careful.  A few more roommates came in and I told them the same thing,
though one didn&rsquo;t trust me for some reason.</p>

<p>I left the house and was in a field watching some designs on the
ground which I realized were zombie traps, specifically to catch white
paint zombies.  Basically they were grills in the ground where white
paint zombies would pour through the grill and not be able to get back
up. The pattern expanded to catch more zombie types until it was
simply a large hole in the groud with a place for bait in the middle
to attract the zombies.  One zombie came toward the hole as my friend
was asking me what the hole was for and I said &ldquo;come with me on this
side of the hole and keep the zombie directly across from us and the
zombile will walk into he hole and become trapped.  Now of course we
have to be careful because when we stand over on this side we are very
close to the trees so they can get us from behind.  plus the hole is
only that deep, so it can&rsquo;t hold like 10 zombies; maybe only 2 or 3.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another zombie came and we led it to drop into the hole, but then as I
left, the zombie climbed out and said thank you.  I told my friend I
had never heard them speak before, so I wasn&rsquo;t sure what that was.
Then I remembered <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VQH040M">MJGs book</a> and
thought I wonder if they&rsquo;re safe now, and asked my friend if they were
safe, and he guessed they might be. I was like, Okay you go first&rdquo; and
he laughed.  I went back toward the zombie who had been able to climb
out and I tentatively went up to him all, um, so , um hi.&rdquo; and he
spoke normally with me, and told me about the time we had gone to a
workshop together, and I hadn&rsquo;t understood the symbology (obviously)
but they guy had.</p>

<p>He showed me some symbols I had apparently seen before and said I had
missed the obvious clues which he had mentioned.  This pattern meant
write.  So I was able to read, but not to write.</p>

<p>This portion means travel and this means somethign else .  Some of the
concepts were being translated poorly as through Japanese and I said I
think I understand.  He pointed out &ldquo;6 of 25&rdquo; and asked what it
means.. &ldquo;well 6 means F and twenty five is near the end of the
alphabet, so Zombie?&rdquo; and wondered if he had gone through a
progression of stages culminating at Zombie, and had reached pure
bliss at this stage..  He spent a lot of time trying to explain the
symbols, which were done in a step by step mathematics now that I look
at it, and he explained that the maker had been waiting for people to
crack the code and said that our little questions had been wasting his
(our) time.</p>

<p>At the end, he was trying to communicate next steps and gave me a
phone number which I was hard-pressed to enter into my phone.  he was
saying 090 and I was typing 090 I thought but the numbers all came out
wrong, I was getting grouchy but stayed cool and just explained that I
didn&rsquo;t know why they weren&rsquo;t working correctlly.  Then I realized that
I was deleting other people&rsquo;s phone numbers while I was tyring to edit
this phone number.</p>

<p>I tried again and again and nearly got to the end of the number which
had more than 4 digits in the last part, then I realized he was saying
S2</p>

<p>space space space space it was some sort of pager wait two seconds for
it to pick up and then send the mesage to the pager, and that was how
I could communicate my desire to hear the next part of the message.</p>

<p>I thanked him and hugged him and thanked him for his time, looking
carfully into his eyes for a period of time, but not knowing if I&rsquo;d be
able to use his informatin since I hand&rsquo;t been able to enter it into
my phone.</p>

<p>Playing silent football, with Nick and Laura D, they kept footballing to each other and then Nick sent it to me and expected me to send it to her, so I made a big show of finding a way to measure the distance to her: I searched in my pockets for a measuring device and found a short length of string and began to measure the distance to her, but it was more than 5 string lengths to get just to the next person so I dramatically tossed it over my shoulder and pulled out a pantomime string and measure one unit for each person away, and determined that Laura was in fact 4 people away from me.  I pantomimed the fwaps to get the ball there and realized that I couldn&rsquo;t because 3 was less than 4, so I shrugged like &ldquo;I have no idea how to do it!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nick sent the football to Laura with a zoom and then a bit later a few hands went up, even though I didn&rsquo;t see an error.  There was a new component to the game: lawyers, who would speak on behalf of their clients.  The hands hadn&rsquo;t just gone up to tattle, but to solicit clients on whose behalf the lawyers could speak.</p>

<p>Then someone showed me some paper with notes written back and forth on it.  I scanned through it but couldn&rsquo;t make much sense of it, so a person next to me (who knew the two people who had written the note) read it to me, using their Jamaican accents, which I don&rsquo;t know if they did naturally or dramatically.  She commented the not actually made some sense if you knew the guys, but their blatant disregard for standardized grammar was a bit challenging to read.</p>

<p>Oh, there was one other new component of the game: message encoding.  People could articulate a certain number of fwaps to be applied from the position of the person to whom they next passed the football by any other means.  It was essentially moving the football twice, and could be a way to pass messages between universes, I realized.</p>

<div class="dream">
I climbed the tree by using my legs/feet as  hands, and baically
climbed with hands and feet gripping the tree below me. I had to
climb back down a bit once I reached the level of the tree house
because there was no door on the tree side of the house, so I climbed
down ~~to the roof are~~ to the floor level and carefully stepped onto the
floor.  The floor was quite solid and particularly dry, covered in
foam cushions.  The other guy was sleeep already and my two friends
were there, having just climbed as well.  I saw some pornography in the
corner but didn't look at it; just made a mental note for later.  We
commented about how dry the place seemed; the roof must be perfectly
sealed.  I looked over the edge and saw a woman on the ground below
and was like "HI" but she didn't think to look up; she looked around
like who said that?

<p>This was a dream where I definitely did not think I could fly!!</p>

<p class="dream">
Climbed up a light pole and found some eggs whihch were soft, but
viable bird eggs and I  placed some which were above a line down below
the line just to do it, and while I was there, one of them started to
hatch.  A little video game bird came out and was attracted to the
video screen.  I realized it was a simlation of sort, the bird was
attracted to the sceand the scene itself was changing through a
different rndomzider.  I enterd the scene as well and found some
points where I should dig being highlighted by slightly jumping upward
like a  quite simple but obvious "pick me" or "dig here" so I went to
the spots in turn and founa bunch of idential keys with non-identical
clues as to where the lock was for the keys.  I din't read them, but
started to put the caches back away in the sand and one of them
wouldn't quite go back down into its hole, and then a guy came up
behind us and announced "everyone, I opened the ceiling to my room and
it got filled with sand" and I expected him to say 'so don't do that"
but he continued, "and everyone has been nominated to help clean up.
Johnson, Steve, Rabbit, Cindy, all of you come in her and help"
</p>

<p>and then Lin came in to wake me up.</p>

<p class="dream"> At a shop selling food: healthy brown rice and stuff
cooked, I bought something and was counting things I had bought: a lot
of empty bottles and received 20,000 yen change but hadn't paid that
much.  The employee said it was okay so I kept it, but didn't
understand the logic.  But I couldn't remember the overall transaction
so assumed it was correct. She asked if I want to have some brown rice
and I was like, "sure!" and she seemed a bit taken aback that I had
accepted her offer, and I countered with "you can use the rice I just
bought" but she ignored me and went into the back to get something.

<p class="dream"> Outside at a park with outdoor concrete table and
Maggie and some guys we didn't know, one passerby took a photo of his
friend's butt, who was like, "hey that's my butt! don't post that
photo" and I joked "well if it's just the butt you have pluasible
deniability: 'that's not my butt!'"  and I said as an aside to Maggie,
but then what if the uncropped photo is released? oops!" and she
laughed.  The guy realized we were friends and offered / asked to take
our picutre.  We put our heads together and I put my arm around her
and the cameraguy asked where we were connected, as if it made a
difference for the photo.  I said at the shoulder and then another guy
came up and got into the photo on Maggie's other side.  I realized I
could barely see the camera over the table and was worried about being
hardly visible in the photo, though the photo crasher guy was well
visible on the camera side of the table.</p>

<p>This dream was from a few hours ago</p>

<p class="dream">I was outside near a street and a woman asked me
something like if she could take a picture with me, and I was like
sure, so I sat down and patted on lap and was like, have a seat and
was a bit surprised because she was an older woman like a short round
cigar smokin cuban grandma, but she was open to new adventures, so she
sat down on my lap. At the same time, the same woman asked me like if
she could borrow something, so I lent her my penis and she was really
surprised and entertained and wanted to show off so she started to pee
on my leg!  The version of her in my lap was like "eww!" as was I,
especially since I was wearing suit pants, but I told her don't worry
I had been drinking plenty of water so it won't be all that bad.  I
used a water hose to rinse the pee away from her bag first because her
lether bag might soak up the smell. Then I sprayed water on my leg to
wash it off and everything was fine.</p>

Each time I tried to enter my Japanese vocabulary words, they were not
being auto-fefined by the dictionary.  I had ot write "ager-teen"
instead of "teeenager" before the translation would come up.

<p class="dream">
When discussing the event with students in my Japanese class, I
realized we hadn't tried to disprove the dust theory by throwing dust
into the air. It makes sense that dancing would kick up dust and cause
more orbs.

<p class="dream"> In an open area wher people wer playing sports, a
guy was hitting baseballs toward a wal and sometimes the balls would
go astray so I went to pick one up and throw it to him.  As I
approached it he said, "free sex if you touch my ball" so I jokingly
stopped and didn't touch it.  He recoverd the baseball and threw it
hard at me.  I flinched and didn't want to be hit so I told him to
stop, but he kept doing it.  I left the area and went back into a
hallway and he pursued me. I spoke strongly to him and some guys were
like "whoah" and stepped away, but I said to them, "go ahead" and "he
won't bother you" and he didn't, but he let them ggo by and came after
me again.  I went outside while I was hearing story about an old
Japanese yakuza guy who used to come to an area where he had lots of
girls every night, and one day he came during the day, and got pissed
off because his favorite TV show wasn't on.  That's what these rich
people are like, thinking the whole world caters to them 24/7" and as
I got outside, I thought I was free of the mean baseball guy, but then
someone pointed me out to him as he came outside.  <span
class="near-lucid">I realized I could choose not to be hurt, so I
imposed that desire on the scene and the attacker stopped,</span> but
I soon woke up.  </p>
