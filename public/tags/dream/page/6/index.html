Dad showed me a plastic cup with ice in the freezer, saying it was his, but one of my girlfriends had drunk out of it.

<div class="dream">
Fred and I were going opposite directions on the
train between Shibuya and Ebisu; I got on the train as he got off.  We
waved to each other, doing huge waves so we could see each other even
as the train was fully outside the station; I was running back and
forth along the seats as my wave so he could see the motion, and I
could see he was doing something equally wavy and we could see each
other all the way until I arrived at Shibuya station where I realized
I was walking in my underwear, but holding a briefcase through the
area and then walking toward the train station, some guys were like,
"woo woo look at this!" and I go, "sometimes I wear evn less!" and
flashed my butt at them as I walked down the stairs to the
station. The train was a shinkansen, arriving on the platform and then
correcting itself and going down on to the tracks, but somepeople had
to scramble a bit to get out of its way.  I walked past some group of
youth and they were like, "hey!" and said "and an ice cream for the
barefoot guy" and a girl with bright red coat pulled me toward the ice
cream stand with their group.

They were talking about church and I was like, "bah i'm not joining
any church" etc and as I began to rail on religion, I started to wake
up from the dream, </div>

<p>so I realized it was noisy brain activity that was waking me and I
shut that down and allowed myself back into dreamland</p>

<div class="dream"> I offered to go to church with them. and we were
in rows and they started a prayer in unison to "Doctor Oregon" (I
think) and I had my own prayer to him: "Doctor Oregon, I invite you to
show yourself and guide me in ever-loving and mutually beneficial ways
for the highest good" or something and I was talking to the group
again after that.

</div>

<p>but I don&rsquo;t really remember what we said.  I woke up soon thereafter.</p>

<p>Special thanks to past-self who was resting in bed and decided to set
up this buffer for writing my dream when future-self wakes up.</p>

<p>##09:11</p>

<div class="dream">
During some kind of war, recieved a flying motorcycle which had been
gear to my DNA and was a gift from the past.  Our friend had driven a
car to kill two bad guys by crushing them into a wall, and we ran over
to take care of him because he was injured in the accident. A guy
asked fro two beers and I went over to the bar and he said it's the
price was 1500 so I gave him a 500 yen coin to start and he started to
give me 500 in change.  I was like, but I gave you.." and he thought I
was saying i gave him more than 2000 and I said, "no this is a 500 yen
coin from Japan" and he's like, "??" and I go, Um what year is this?
And he said it's "UN-11" and I explained I was born in 1970 and they
were like, "wth?" because no one knew how long ago that was.

I was able toremember that I had been in Japan until at least 2014,
but wasn't sure past that what happened.

He gave me a flying seat thing; it wasn't much more than just an
engine or maybe I had it and he just put in a new battery or
something, but the main point was they couldn't activate it.  It had
some kind of PGP key that was needed, and somewhere in my body was the
passphrase to unlock it.  I remotely communicated with my commander
that I was about to try the device, and it would either work or not; I
didn't know the password.  It worked immediately and I got on.

I remembered how to fly, but it was a bit unstable at first, but I
could achieve much higher speeds than by normal (dream) flying modes
with no external propulsion.

I flew over the local cluster of buildings and towaard the city,
hoping I wouldn't crash into the other myriad flying devices, because
I didn't know the local laws.  I flew up into some power lines (*) and
fortunately went through them instead of being injured.
</div>

<p>(*) high tension power lines used to often show up in my flying dreams; I hadn&rsquo;t seen them in a while until last night.</p>

<div class="dream"> Andrew Basiago was looking for an assistant and I
applied for the job.  He knew me already, so I just wrote Rob Nugen on
the list because I figured he already had my contact information.  For
a while I thought I should have written it just to be sure, but it was
okay.  There were several other people in the line, and I glanced over
and saw my name on the list he had written so I guesed it was fine.

The crowds thinned out and Andrew motioned to me that we could go up
to have our meeting in his office.

His house was two stories in a neighborhood within walking distance of
my house.  I had my cat Jennie with me but didn't think I should take
her into his house, so I planned to just leave her outside, which my
wife wouldn't appreciate, so I said, "hey I better take Jennie home"
and Andrew agreed, and encouraged me, as always, to do the right
thing.

I caught Jennie as she was running down the wooden steps from his
house and walked her to my house.

Inside, I got sidetracked, on something tangentially related, like
writing in my diary that I had met Andrew, and during that moment I
forgot he was actually waiting for me. I thought _oh no I was supposed
to get right back!_ I thought Andrew would be upset, so I started to
rush back.

As I exited my house, there a moving van was arriving outside, and I
remembered that someone was moving in to replace a housemate (sister?)
who was moving out. I realized I should wait to tell them where to
move the stuff, but then saw lots of people were there as well, and I
realized someone else could show them.

On the way to Andrews's house again, I was climbing up a steep (45
degree) slope made of 2x4 boards, and a young girl started playfully
chasing me up.  I didn't want to engage her so I tried to hurry, but
realized that would be rude, so I let her catch me.  She confided to
me a note she had written about food, which she dared not show her
parents.

It started with "shit: " and went on about food that she didn't like
to eat, and had several lines drawn between the food categories
broccoli, epeas, asparagus, etc. that she didn't like.

I asked her if I could have it and she said it was for me.  I
refolded it (in half widthwise and then in half twice the other
direction).

I walked down the white sandstone slab steps down the hill toward
Andrew's front door and found my computer which I had left on top of
the steps. I started to cry a bit because I had left something so
important to me outside and forgotten about it.  I picked it up with
thanks that it was still there and Andy opened the door by the time I
got to his porch.  I apologized for thinking I'd be right back and
explained that the girl had given me a cute note.

He unfolded it on his glass desk and the paper spread out into a map
of the city with her writing still on it.  He asked, "so where are we
focusing?" and then he noticed her writing again in the center of the
map.  An overhead camera displayed the map on his computer screen,
using software processing to flatten it out as he unfolded it.

I was like, "wow!  It would take me hours to scan that whole thing"
Andrew agreed and said that's why he bought the overhead scanning
system.

He asked me what title I wanted for my role as his assistant.  I
didn't know this was an option, so I just repeated what I had seen
somewhere else, "PG?" and he said, "are you sure you want Programmer?"
for that's what PG meant.  I was like, "ohhh!" because I hadn't known
what the PG meant and thought about it for a while.  I thought of TT,
Time Traveler, but figured that would be too obvious.  I came up with
"TE" for Time Enhancer, meaning that I wanted to help everyone improve
the quality of their experience of time, to be more fully present in
their moments of experience.
</div>

<p>I began to wake up and reviewed the dream in my mind so I could recall
it for my journal.  Lin&rsquo;s alarm went off, bringing me more fully awake
so I jumped up to write the dream before I lost it.</p>

<p>notes:</p>

<p>PG? was &ldquo;PG&rdquo; plus some letter, but the question mark is what I don&rsquo;t
remember</p>

<p>At no time was I lucid or even aware I could affect things in the
dream world</p>

<p>The girl was from my kindergarten class (on Wednesdays);
<a href="/2014/11/26/a-bit-repetitive-kids-class/">she&rsquo;s the one who cried during hokey pokey</a>.</p>

<p>AB was written for brevity.  AB is <em>not</em> the same AB when I write about &ldquo;website for AB&rdquo; or &ldquo;AB website&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;concerted&rdquo; was concrete, which more accurately was white limestone which I saw at UH and Rice University.</p>

<div class="dream">
Interesting set of movies were planned at local theater:

    Planet Terror, etc

I was in back of theater and read the list of movies for the crowd, while Paola was the projectionist.

First movie had a secret menu before it started, like a master menu
for all six movies.  The top of one menu said "Planet Terror Real
Menu" and had items like, "PLAY ALL MOVIES" "EXIT" and a few others.
Selected "PLAY ALL MOVIES" then the movie started and a guy was like
hey try my app!  It will simulate me stalking you!  It will be great!

And I go "no thanks" and I wasn't sure if this was the movie, or how I
would know the difference between movie and reality, and then he was
like "oh hey I noticed your sister is getting married next week..."
And I became a character in that movie:

We were in a slow paced rural city bar, making plans for wedding, and
my sister was plannin g to get married.  She had been working at the
bar, but there were rumors that she'd no longer be able to work after
getting married for some reason; either leaving the town or becoming
full time mom; there was also some bit of scandal; I was worried about
being set up against my sister somehow due to the game on my phone.

With food still onthe table som epeople started to pull the blanket from the bed to cver it, and I kept holding it back saying wait because it would get the balnketst dirty with peach sauce and water some chicken remains; I tried picking up the food; there wasn't much left and finally they stopped and I asked for a towel to wipe up the water and then some orange juice got spiled on the bedge of the bed mattress.  Oh man so now we gotta clean that up.  Fortunatel tere was a plastic liner of holding the liquid so when I got a big towel it sopped up the liquid readily and almost none remained in the bed.  I throught it was very convenient and lucky because if someone peed in the bed, it would be a mess but someone had not so it was okay.  Allthe juice stopped up and I wen t to a dreain the the middle o  the room and  twisted the towerl to squeeze out the liquid. I dripped down into the drean, though not as much came out as I suspected.  I watched teh waer go down the drain and it was all cleaned up.

<p>And through all of that , I didn&rsquo;t pee in the bed.</p>

<div class="dream">
We were walking around the kitchen / stores and a woman offered a
sample donut.  It was sticky raw on the inside but crispy on the
outside, just like the dough from which she pulled it.  She would rip
off part of the dough, including some crust and soft part inside and
fold it so that the crust would be outside.  I asked how she made them
and she showed me and I wondered if they were safe to eat, not being
cooked.  I got some other candy from a nearby place and then went back
to the corner of the room where M was sitting.

M came to SWUUSI with me though he wasn't fully "into it" as he had to
wake up early the next day and be in South Padre.  I was like, "that's
really far away, actually" so he decided to go there now and attend
SWUUSI from there.  I wasn't sure he'd have much time at SWUUSI that
way, but before I could say that his friends came up and jibed him
about a dog he had seen.  He denied it and and introduced me a bit and
I asked one of them his name.  He said Kelly or some other
could-be-a-girl's name.  I offered him some of the candy and he opened
his mouth.  Gross get it yourself.

"ohhhh, those are *our* boxes!" we kept repeating it because the reality was setting in  We had decided to start a restaurant.  "Oh, those are *our* boxes"
Oh my goodness, we started a restaurant,  that's *rtight*!
I wondered how we were even going to get the boxes upstairs where we had space to put tables for people to eat.  I tried to wonder what it would be like with people inn our home, eating; who was going to cook? I guess I would have to do lots of dishes from here on out.  I realized that it wouldn't be that I had to wash every dish every niht, at least at first because they wouldn't have found out about our restaurant at first.  I consoled myelf that we'd have maybe a single couple as guests on the first night.

Loking at the refridgerator I knew it was full of food but we'd have to buy a lot more, and then carry it upstairs to be cooked or maybe serverd if we cooked down there.One guy was leaving just as the boxes came in.  he had been talking about something but we didn't need any, so we were liek "okay thanks an let him go


Lin got a phone call from Meg, who was related to the first person like her mom or daughter and I thought, oh it's related to the other news; someone had gotten hurt and then it turns out she was dying from yeras of smoking, and I was like, "well..." (ya should ahve thought of that before you started smoking) and Rita came over talking about a non-smoking campaign and I said yeah they have some resources in Shibuya to give peoplefor free and I'd take hero over there if she wanted.  She aaid no, politely, but I understood she was still in grief over the death to want to deal with something new. she needed to go or I jusat wanted her to go so I was like, "okay, so we'll see you later!" and got up so she left and as she was leaving a guy was brining in a bunch of boxes.  Who the hell are those for? We wondered...

<div class="dream">
Flying away from bad guys over a large hilly area, they were trying to
get me and my cat. We were in a city street and I was able to fly to
get away from them after a while.  I didn't realize I was dreaming
but I realized I could fly away so I did so.  I realized I could
control the situation a bit.  They were threatening me while inside a
room where I had been so I had to abandon that room.

Dreamed that some guys were hanging out talking about our lives and I
mentioned that my dad's dad hadn't been in his life and my dad wasn't
in my life now, and I wasn't in my kids' lives, but as I woke up I
realized actually my dad isn't in my kids' lives
