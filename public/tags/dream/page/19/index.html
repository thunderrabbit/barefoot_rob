<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>At work Kevin had received a letter thouhgt it had been sent
to his wrong address and was forwarded to him.  He was surpised that anyoe
would have the old address considering how much mail he was getting on a
dialy basis.</p>

<p class=dream>I set out to desig a way to allow us to verify that a human
was writing him an email from the place online where the old address was
published.</p>

<p class=dream>This techniue involved setting up an array of days of the
week and reassigning numbers tto them randomly, and then asking the human
what day of the week it was, but then the reasignment woul assure that the
answere wasn't being given by a bot that had been programmed o know the days
of the week.  Or something like that.</p>

<p class=dream>I began to sketch out the technique and I needed to represet
7 people on a calendar, so I cut out images of seven differentt people fom
YRUU and randomly ut their images on the days of the wek on his calendar.  I
labeled 3 of them "Bass" and 2 of them "Tenor" and 3 of them "Alto"</p>

<p class=dream>I had just made them as examples to get my point across; the
labels could be anything we want.  But then Denise saw how I had leabeled
them and tok great offense at what I had done, but wouldn't come outt
clearly and say what was the problem.</p>

<p class=dream>I was like, "these are just examples, look I can relable this
one "Tenor" and now we have 2 bass, 3 tenor and 3 alto, but tthis is just an
example.</p>

<p class=dream>She was still upset, and I had no idea why.  Finally she was
all, "I can't believe you labeled this person as "Bass"</p>

<p class=dream>I'm like, I don't even know what bass means, I was just using
this as an example; I cut the images out randomly and it doesn't matter at
all.</p>

<p class=dream>We relabeled the name and then I thought about the whole
thing and I was really mad.</p>

<p class=dream>"<em>Now</em> I'm angry!" I got up.  we were outside on some
grass near a parking lot.  "I can't believe you would think I'd stoop so low
as to maliciously label someone bass!! "  I was yelling and furious.</p>

<p class=dream>Now I was yelling at my dad.  We were pacing around facing
each other like mountain lions in a standoff.</p>

<p class=dream>He started to smile at the irony of anger over such a little
thing.   I was still furious with my gaze burning into his eyes.</p>

<p class=dream>He said something as his point number one.  then he said, "I
wonder if I could punch you," and extended his fist slowly and it barely
touched my left eyebrow.</p>

<p class=dream>"You better not punch me I said," for I will wail the shit
out of you, I thought.  Then I realized it would be better to do nothing if
he punched me, so I was just about to say "for I will do nothing," but he
had stepped back about 30 meters before I could say it.</p>

<p class=dream>I stood my ground strongly in the standing yoga pose that I
spell tadasana.  My dad threw a punch at me so hard that his ring broke off
from his finger with a resounding CRACK and the top of the ring flew at me
and hit me.  I tried to dodge or block it, but it still hit me and stung a
little, but not too much.</p>

<p class=dream>I realized the skill he must possess to throw a punch into
the air so hard that it breaks his ring, so I clapped twice.  The kind of
clap that occurs in a movie when our protagonist is on stage practicing a
song and is so focused on the moment that they don't notice the one person
sitting in the otherwise empty audience, and when the song is over, the
protagonist's spell is broken by the slow clap of that one person.</p>

<p class=dream>I clapped slowly twice and then went to pick up the part of
the ring that had hit me and I woke up.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>In my old apartment on West Gray, I was listening to one of
the obnoxious night DJs on KRBE - Adam Smasher I think.  Except his
telephone helper girl was at my apartment chillin'.</p>

<p class=dream>I wanted to tell a story or some such over the air, so she
got me through to the DJ who was all, "blah blah what's your name?"</p>

<p class=dream>I told him and just started this tirade description of what
I've been up to lately as if people want to hear about that, and he was
surprisingly quiet, no inerrupting me as I was expecting him to do, even
when I got sidetracked by Christine and Daniel bounding into the room
un-announced, except that it wasn't Daniel, but Will from YRUU.</p>

<p class=dream>I was all, "say HI on the radio!" and they said HI and I
continued my story.  The end of the story had to do with finances or
something, because I made a reference to "Money Matters" and then was all,
"oh I can't say that MM word on this station; that's a radio show on a
different station."</p>

<p>something else and I woke up.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p class=dream>Had just driven my car (it was my old Oldsmobile Omega) and
had a bit of trouble parking it because the steering wheel seemed to be
missing, and the brakes didn't work.</p>

<p class=dream>I looked all around, and the place where the steering column
should be had nothing but the gear shift of the automatic transmission and a
little tiny bit of the steering column, which I could use to steer the car
with some difficulty.</p>

<p class=dream>As I was backing into the space, I nearly hit the mail truck
behind me, but I yanked the emergency brake really hard, so it was way up by
the ceiling of the car, except that the car was now a convertible.</p>

<p class=dream>I got out, still looking for the steering wheel, noting that
it must be very close by because I had to have used it to drive the car this
far.</p>

<p class=dream>Suddenly, the roof of the car was back on top of the car,
even though I didn't remember converting it .  This was all very
strange.</p>

<p class=note>(and further strange is that I didn't recognize I must be
dreaming!)</p>

<p class=dream>I was now in someone's driveway, and they were looking for
inline skates or something, and I lifted the back part of the roof of my car
to look in the pile of junk back there to see if I had something they could
use.</p>

<p>I see this dream as the car represents my life now as I'm somewhat
releasing the steering wheel.  And the junk in the back is all my baggage
(stuff that I've collected so far this life) and I have the opportunity now
to release that stuff to people who will be interested in using it.
(Including my skates? ... Hmm; I'm not using them lately, but I still like
having them in case I wanna skate again)</p>

<p class=note>dreams</p>

<p class=dream>Many many ceiling tiles were missing in my apartment,
and I helped fix them by drilling holes in some wooden frames so they
could be attached to the ceiling.</p>

<p class=dream>Someone pointed out that we could get some natural glue
products that would work better than screws to hold the frame in place
- carrots.  I'm not sure how that was supposed to work exactly,
though.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class=dream>With Bryn in London again, and she intended to take a
very high dollar high class tour to somewhere.  Jason Fricke was there
and tried to talk his way onto the tour.  'You got any second or third
class seats I can use?' and the ticket person was all, 'no, we have
nothing below first class.'</p>

<p class=dream>Bryn was all upset that someone was trying to take the
same tour as her without having done the same calibre of research she
had done for so long.</p>

<p class=dream>I hugged her.</p>

<p class=note>dream</p>

<p class=dream>with Tammy/Lee-eh and some one who might have been my
gay friend Kenneth from gymnastics outside in a Target parking lot, and
we were getting in to Tammy's car, but we were arbitrarily trying to
make it more difficult in the following way.  We all had to remain
in physical contact with one another, 9touching the hand of someone
else in the group, and had to get in on opposite sides of the car.</p>

<p class=dream>I got in first and Tammy got in after me (o the same
side) but had to crawl over me to get into the middle seat, and the
Kenneth had to climber over the to of the car to get in the other side
of the car, but he had to remain holding my hand the entire time.</p>

<p class=dream>Must have been plasticman, cause he was ale to do it
without regrabbing my or tammy's had through the sun roof or the other
side of the car, and when he got there the door was locked, so I threw
him the keys up through the sunroof, all the while my left arm was out
the left hand door and still touching his hand as he was standing on
the right had side of the car.</p>

<p class=dream>- - -</p>

<p class=dream>A couple of times I decided to write down the dream,
but I only dreamt I was writing it down.  and I was curious why Lee-eh
and Tammy seemed interchangeable in the dream, and Kenneth and Marcel
seemed interchangeable</p>

<p class=dream>Tammy I haven't seen in years, is a ex g/f friend is
gay, while tall, and lee-eh I have only hugged a shook hands wit, is a
current friend, and is short and japanese and I know nothing of her
orientation, but I know she has a had a boyfriend</p>

<p class=dream>Kenneth is black and gay and I haven't seen him in
years ad marcel is recent friend and is anti-gay and white thinks gay
is bad because the bible says so.</p>

<p class=dream>I went back to work at Kroger, back in
Tomball it seemed.  I had just arrived we they were
all, "okay, whoever does the best work helping to
clean up he store will get a prize of some sort."</p>

<p class=dream>I had noticed that on top of the
display cases was enough dust to keep me busy
collecting dust for a while.  So I searched briefly
for a broom and a bucket to collect dust in.  I then
went to the aisle of the store where they might sell
those dust picker upper things (static cloth) and I
found gloves instead.  I found some relatively nice
gloves for $8, which I decided that I could use later,
so I would buy them.</p>

<p class=dream>Put them on and climbed up onto the..
actually there were steps available to climb up the
first couple of feet - items like a upside down bucket
and a stepstool randomly left by the end of the
display case so I climbed easily up on top and found
that the guy who had bee working at Kroger 15 years
ago was still working at Kroger, ad I didn't really
like him then, but I was willing to get to know him
this time and not immediately continue to dislike him.
 He had had the same cleanup idea as me, but he had a
mop instead of a broom, and making a terrific mess of
all the dust because the top of he case was made of
plywood or particle board, so it was soaking up the
water.  He also got sidetracked doing something else,
so he wasn't even working on cleaning up the dust.</p>

<p class=dream>We talked a bit about the new vantage
point from up on the display case; we could see
customers doing silly hings and watch other people
work.  I was sweeping the dust into a pile at the end
of the row and I noticed that my gloves kept coming
off, or I was taking them off and not remembering
it.</p>

<p class=dream>I swept a pretty big pile of dust into
a pile and put on my gloves to begin putting it into
the bucket.  I noticed something like carrot
shreddings in the pile and asked him what they were. 
They were from the small potted plants on the top of
the case that were losing their thin leaves.  Ah. 
that makes sense.</p>

<p class=dream>Walking below us a manager lady was
all, "do you have anyting to do?"</p>

<p class=dream>"no," I stated plainly as I filled the
bucket.</p>

<p class=dream>"then you can leave."</p>

<p class=dream>"What? I was just kidding! gee I
thought it was obvious given that I'm putting a huge
pile of dust and grass clippings into this bag."</p>

<p class=dream>She continued on her way.</p>

<p class=dream>So I was dumping all this grass
clippings and dust into the bucket, and the bucket was
full before I finished, so I had my friend get another
bag or something to put the rest in.  I had a grocery
bag (paper) to pile some in,  but it had some old
clothes in the bottom.  I gave these clothes a mental
blessing  that they would be found by someone who
could use them, but then I had a sense that I sould
not put them in there and I asked my higher self, and
I saw a snake nearby on the forest floor on top of the
freezer case in the store.  I noticed there were
actually three snakes there, and I got out my camera
to take a picture, which I did, and I think it came
out well on the second shot.</p>

<p class=dream>I noticed some more snakes hanging from
the branches of these large pine trees, and walked
cautiously so I wouldn't step on or otherwise
encounter a snake; I didn't know if they were
poisonous or otherwise aggressive.</p>

<p class=dream>I noticed that this freezer case seemed
wider than it had been; used to be that I dould walk
to its edges in a few steps, that I was a bit
concerned about falling off.  Now it was a forest with
a huge grassy plain beside it.  I found an old linux
book from about 1970, which had a description of
procmail as a techniqure for getting rid of spam.</p>

<p class=dream>I began to flip through it as I walked
toward the train, and as reading the book, noticed
that the words were not making sense, and woke up.

<p class=note>(Dream)</p>

<p class=dream>I went back to work at Kroger, back in
Tomball it seemed.  I had just arrived we they were
all, "okay, whoever does the best work helping to
clean up he store will get a prize of some sort."</p>

<p class=dream>I had noticed that on top of the
display cases was enough dust to keep me busy
collecting dust for a while.  So I searched briefly
for a broom and a bucket to collect dust in.  I then
went to the aisle of the store where they might sell
those dust picker upper things (static cloth) and I
found gloves instead.  I found some relatively nice
gloves for $8, which I decided that I could use later,
so I would buy them.</p>

<p class=dream>Put them on and climbed up onto the..
actually there were steps available to climb up the
first couple of feet - items like a upside down bucket
and a stepstool randomly left by the end of the
display case so I climbed easily up on top and found
that the guy who had bee working at Kroger 15 years
ago was still working at Kroger, ad I didn't really
like him then, but I was willing to get to know him
this time and not immediately continue to dislike him.
 He had had the same cleanup idea as me, but he had a
mop instead of a broom, and making a terrific mess of
all the dust because the top of he case was made of
plywood or particle board, so it was soaking up the
water.  He also got sidetracked doing something else,
so he wasn't even working on cleaning up the dust.</p>

<p class=dream>We talked a bit about the new vantage
point from up on the display case; we could see
customers doing silly hings and watch other people
work.  I was sweeping the dust into a pile at the end
of the row and I noticed that my gloves kept coming
off, or I was taking them off and not remembering
it.</p>

<p class=dream>I swept a pretty big pile of dust into
a pile and put on my gloves to begin putting it into
the bucket.  I noticed something like carrot
shreddings in the pile and asked him what they were. 
They were from the small potted plants on the top of
the case that were losing their thin leaves.  Ah. 
that makes sense.</p>

<p class=dream>Walking below us a manager lady was
all, "do you have anyting to do?"</p>

<p class=dream>"no," I stated plainly as I filled the
bucket.</p>

<p class=dream>"then you can leave."</p>

<p class=dream>"What? I was just kidding! gee I
thought it was obvious given that I'm putting a huge
pile of dust and grass clippings into this bag."</p>

<p class=dream>She continued on her way.</p>

<p class=dream>So I was dumping all this grass
clippings and dust into the bucket, and the bucket was
full before I finished, so I had my friend get another
bag or something to put the rest in.  I had a grocery
bag (paper) to pile some in,  but it had some old
clothes in the bottom.  I gave these clothes a mental
blessing  that they would be found by someone who
could use them, but then I had a sense that I sould
not put them in there and I asked my higher self, and
I saw a snake nearby on the forest floor on top of the
freezer case in the store.  I noticed there were
actually three snakes there, and I got out my camera
to take a picture, which I did, and I think it came
out well on the second shot.</p>

<p class=dream>I noticed some more snakes hanging from
the branches of these large pine trees, and walked
cautiously so I wouldn't step on or otherwise
encounter a snake; I didn't know if they were
poisonous or otherwise aggressive.</p>

<p class=dream>I noticed that this freezer case seemed
wider than it had been; used to be that I dould walk
to its edges in a few steps, that I was a bit
concerned about falling off.  Now it was a forest with
a huge grassy plain beside it.  I found an old linux
book from about 1970, which had a description of
procmail as a techniqure for getting rid of spam.</p>

<p class=dream>I began to flip through it as I walked
toward the train, and as reading the book, noticed
that the words were not making sense, and woke up.

<p class=dream>Fred and I were our current age, but alone at our ex-ex
house from elementary school.  We were so mad and fighting with each
other.  I was just so <em>pissed</em> at him!  I don't even really
know why, but just pissed and calling him all sorts of names, refusing
to help him with our chores, and we were both undermining each other's
work.</p>

<p>I was extremely glad to wake up from this dream.</p>

<p class=date>2:54am CDT Wednesday 30 August 2000</p>
<p class=note>(dream)</p>

<p><p class=dream>I got a postcard from my friend Suzanne, something
like, &ldquo;Rob!  I just heard that KTRU might let each DJ have his own
radio show so you can actually talk on the air!  You can say whatever
you want!  You can take callers on the air!! &ldquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>She wanted an internet connection that would allow her
to listen online.  &ldquo;But frst&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what works?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>In my dream&rsquo;s mind I answered &lsquo;DSL&rsquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>I kept reading. Her postcard included the original
message written by Meagyn, one of the DJs, who was all, &ldquo;Welcome back
from summer break.  Okay here&rsquo;s the deal: each KTRU DJ will get their
own show to do any format they want.  I&rsquo;m so excited to hear Rob get
to talk more on the air.  And who can&rsquo;t resist hearing cute Sarah talk
more on the air?</p>

<p><p class=dream>&ldquo;To answer someone else&rsquo;s question,&rdquo; she continued,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll refer you to some movie starring Sting and David Bowie.  They
used a medley of Tori Amos, mixing songs from several of her albums.
&lsquo;caught a lite sneeze&rsquo; mixed with &lsquo;god&rsquo; and &lsquo;winter.&rsquo;  So use your own
best judgement on how to do that.</p>

<p><p class=dream>On the face of the card, I realized it was not from
Suzanne, but from Vicky, one of the DJs, who had put a small picture
of herself on the card.  The picture was labeled &lsquo;Debe&rsquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>I had to go to the bathroom in my dream, so I got out
of bed where Karla and Drew (from work) and I had all been in bed
like three platonic sardines and I went to the restroom at work.
Some men had just left it a horrible mess with toilet paper all
shredded and all over the floor and toilets not flushed. and I slipped
on pee and landed beside the toilet.  Very gross and I woke up.</p>

<p><p>I had to pee.</p>

<p class=note>(dream)</p></p>

<p><p class=dream>Driving back to my old neighborhood, this time driving
all the way in through the front of the subdivision so I could have a
glimpse of some trains being driven backwards at 10am.  Somehow I had
seen a note written that the train would drive backwards at 10am on
the day.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I got to the model train museum, which was about a mile
from my house on Methil and the guy inside was driving a model train.
I told him I had previously lived in the area and I was here to see
the train drive backward and he was unimpressed with seeing it.</p>

<p><p class=dream>There was a small water fountain thing on a table
beside him and a small cockroach floating walking around on the water.
The guy wanted to kill the roach, but his son was adamantly opposed.
A woman who loked like Alex from Youth Council walked up and said in
her country they would eat rocahes.  I was grossed out and walked
away.  She proceeded to cut its head off and legs off and eat it.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I could hear her from the other room and she was all,
&ldquo;oooh this was terrible!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p class=dream>There were balloons inflated and scattered about the
rom a bit - there had been a party apparently.  They were left over.</p>

<p><p>- - - Then I either slept more deeply or something because the next
part of this dream is the same dream, in the same building, but a few
minutes later in the dream.  I don&rsquo;t remember the few minutes.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I was reading the insructions for how to rebuild the
lawnmower.  I had had problems with it not running very well.  The
instructions where quite specific.  I started reading the instruction
in the middle and was comparing the lawnmower engine to the images in
the instructions.  There were three valves and it described how they
opened in sequence and how one valve should be open while the other
two were closed.  I held one of the valves in my hand, just moving it
in its casing.  Then realized that I still had to take the carburetor
off.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I took the screw out of the carburetor and then thought
I should read the instructions.  I put the screw part way back in and
started to read from the beginning.  I looked back over at the
lawnmower and saw a small discarded roll of electrical tape lodged
between the three spark plugs!  I thought, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s the whole problem&rdquo;
and looked back over at my work bench to find something to dislodge
the tape.  I looked for something made of wood just in case there was
any residual charge on the spark plugs.  I had a vague feeling that it
was impossible for the plugs to hold a charge, but I wanted to be
safe.</p>

<p><p class=dream>I found a scrap of wood and I was hearing a hissing noise and
looked back over and three little sprays of gasoline were squirting
down out of the screw which I had not screwed all the way back in.  I
panicked and looked around for any imminent danger.  Seeing none, I
reached over and pushed the screw in and it sparked and the gas
exploded in my face.</p>

<p><p class=dream>The exposion was brief but I could feel the residual
burn in my lungs and face.  I dreaded looking at my face fearing it
would be all burned and really painful.  I woke up.</p>
