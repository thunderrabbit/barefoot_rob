<p class="dream">
I looked up at the clock and stopped mid-sentence.  "What?  Is it
1:30am?  Oh my god I must have fallen asleep!  I can only remember
maybe 45 minutes extra, but it's been three hours!!"  I asked each one
if they fell asleep but they wer lie (shrug) "no not really" but I was
sure they were just not sure because we were all groggy.  I apologized
a lot and wondered how it could have happened!

Soness was going to drop in on a lunch meeting with some organization
which she determined had a meeting somewhere in Shibuya.  She asked if
I could cover her lesson in the same timeslot.  I admired her ability
to join the meeting; it wasn't something I could do, so I was like,
"sure I can teach for you!"

<p class="dream">Soness and them went over to the right and I got
caught up in a crowd, so I turned the other way and went straight to
the stage where we were about to perform.  The director was like, "hey
Rob!" and "ya know, I see you each day right in the center of the gap
in the crowd way up on the top seating area." and I go "well, it's the
center!" and "by the way I have shoes on because I didn't take them
off last night to sleep!" I realized, because I sure hadn't put on
shoes recently...  </p>

<p class="dream">In a slightly enclosed area, Travis and I were
playing a version of baseball.  We would each take one turn at bat,
and keep track of where our ghost players had made it around the
bases.  We were pretty well tied, though we kept getting hits.  It was
my turn at bat, and someone gave me a broken bat as a joke, so I used
it as a joke and got a pretty good hit, making it to third base,
though Travis tagged home base before my ghost runner would have made
it there.  I was sure next time I could make it to first, and
therefore my ghost on third would get a run.</p>

<p class="dream">
Travis and I were in a virtual reality on my computer.  He showed me a
room that was similar to what I had seen before, so I almost didn't go
inside to explore.  Then I was like, "wait if Travis showed me this,
it must be cool" so I went inside to check the place out.  It was
*amazing* with 3D virtual games inside the groom, a hologram which
could be manipulated by touching the screen and project into the room;
and some hidden rooms behind the walls with hinged doors on mirrors
that caused the hologram to reflect "infinitely" back and forth; it
was so realistic that I made a joke "the Matrix is everywhere".
</p>

<p class="dream">
I found a super hidden corner which even Travis hadn't heard about
while reading people's logs about exploring the place; it was hidden
behind an inflatable statue and in between the statue and the wall was
a panel that could be opened and revealed a mirror hinged between a
panel hinged between a mirror and the mirrors were offset from each
other so I wondered how they functioned while hinged like that.  I
pulled the device out and showed Travis but he said he hadn't seen it
before.  Wow. I was one of the first people on the internet to find
this part of this virtual room!  Travis said he had to get going and
was glad that I had enjoyed the place.  Most def!  So we started to
lock up everything the way we had found it and one door was unable
to lock because its adjoining latch was on a frame that had been bent
so that the door coudln't reach it anymrore. I guessed we had to leave
that part open.
</p>

<p class="dream">
I saw that Travis had picked up a lot of broken glass to clean up the
place and I got a trtansmission from Marcel who was like, "dude are
you still there?" cause he had read my journal entry about it and
wanted to see the place as well, so he beamed over and I was like,
"Duuuuude!" and he was like "Duuuuuude!!" and I introduced Travis
and Marcel and then they were talking for a bit but Travis had to go
so Marcel was talking to me to see the new thing I had found.  I
told him I forgot to take pictures and he was like, "aw man I knew
I should have contacted you sooner!"
</p>

<p class="dream">
I stepped over a virtual tar pit  and started to wake up.

<div class="dream">
In a large city the train was late or otherwise displaced but we
arrived on time on the right hand side of a large building where we had
been.

Everyone was lined up in three lines, waiting for the van to be ready.
I jokingly ran up to be in front of one of the lines in front of a
youth to tease her, but she wasn't phased by my cutting in line. I was
like, "wow I like how Meg (R) didn't even care."  I got out of line as
they started to move forward and get in the van.

Driving in the van in a large muddy area with several youth in the
back, my van was a bicycle and I was driving very carefully so it
wouldn't be bumpy, but I coudln't put my foot down cause I would get
stuck.

As we left, I saw my acquaintence who was a big bald guy who looked
like Michael "Tiny" from SC back at UH I was like "hey man see you
soon; we're gonna hang out cause Spring is coming!" He was like "yeah
let's do it!" or something equally affirmative.

Lin was driving another bicycle but had low air pressure and couldn't
make it up a relatively steep embankment; we were in a crater shaped
bowl of dirt and she couldn't ride up the side wall.  She goes, "can
you help me?" and I was like, "hang on" because I coudln't stop riding
or put my foot down I ended up doing a large slow kickout with my back
tire and hoped everyone inside the van was okay.

<div class="dream">Dreamt Japan was at war and Tokyo had been
attacked.  We were all on a wall outside a highway and scrambled up the
wall when we heard the news.  I tried to put on my armor and as I
watched from bird's eye perspective, an enemy truck invaded the town.
It was more like a "monster truck" chassis, all very flat, with no
structure taller than the wheels (so it could flip upside down and
still roll).  Some of our trucks tried to ram its axles to disable it,
but they were ineffective.

Bryn came to the city for a vacation and I had to tell her we were at
war. she was like, "what?" as if she hadn't heard me.  She couldn't
believe it by looking around; everything seemed fine.  I said we can't
stop here and have to keep walking to another area where we'd be safe
(outside Tokyo).

<div class="dream">
Looking at my left leg + foot skeleton (femur to phalanges), which had
been removed from my body, I was confused how I was still able to
stand on my apparently existing legs.  I determined it was my left leg
that had been removed by looking at the foot of the dismembered limb;
the flesh was (suddenly) all intact, and I could see the big toe, and
could see a large scar on the bottom of the foot.

I was like "yep there's my scar," (*) and thought it was interesting to
easily see it up close now that it had been removed from my body.

My friend was like wow let me see that as he was flexing it then he goes
wow your feet are big!  I go yep!  30シェンチ (Japanese for 30 cm)
</div>

<p>(*) I don&rsquo;t have such a scar in real life, though I did cut the bottom
of my foot one time (though I don&rsquo;t currently recall if it was my left
or right foot)</p>

<p>I woke up realizing I hadn&rsquo;t written the war dream when I first had
it; I guess it was a couple hours ago, and I&rsquo;ve lost some detail</p>

<p><em>OH!</em> there were US coin in my dream:</p>

<div class="dream">The US penny had been switched back to wheat
pennies Lincoln pennies were stuck for fifty years and then wheat
pennies were being struck again, and I was reading or watching an
article on the change.

"The face of Lincoln and the numeral 1 make it easy for anyone to
identify the penny" some narration was extolling the penny's virtues.
"Even a person from Palestine can quickly see its value. Some people
think the new wheat pennies are a regression in style, but others are
happy to see the change."
</div>

<p>No pun intended</p>

<hr />

<p>Note this is the second time I dreamt about war and coins (including a
concept of history) after ET Contact meetup nights.  These motifs are
certainly not common in my &ldquo;normal&rdquo; dreams!</p>

<p>A few times while sleeping last night, I bent my legs up to my chest
(to help relax my lower back), but this lifted my futon cover too much
so I got cold and put them back down.</p>

<div class="dream">
In a large house with many rooms, a woman was kinda stalking me,
telling me she wanted me to give her a baby; I was like no way and
trying to escape her, through different interconnected rooms and
department store displays.  I ran down a long hallway and downstairs
to where my sane friends were outside and I realized I could fly, so I
flew upwards and wondered if I could fly quickly this time, and found
that I could.  Some high tension power lines were there, but I was
able to quickly fly over them and away.

In a school, Lin and I walked up some steps to a counter where we were
to pick up our tickets for travel.   The guy was like, do you have
your stripe card? which I had been given but couldn't find at that
moment.  I found it latler in a different pocket of my wallet (change
compartnemtn) and moved it to the first plae I had looked for it,
while thinking of the LPT I had seen regarding this, though Iit was
already a practice I practice.  On the boat, we were headed from Viet
Nam back to Japan and were looking at options for travel.  One way was
shorter but had strong currents against us, but we chose that way
anyway and were turning into the current area when the driver got back
in the boat and I had been turning it.  We were next to some other
boats in this industrial waste wasted sea and there was no food from
the ocean, but a guy had broght ramen.  Lin was looking for food as
she didn't want to eat industrial waste and I was just going to go
hungry instead; it was only one more day.

Walking next to the train while he spoke in English and it was
translated to Spanish for the local population riding on the train.
The train slowed down as I realized I was gonna get squished between
it and a fence, so I leapt across the tracks (with fence behind me and
train paused, approaching on my left) and then climbed aboard the
train as it continued its journey.  They had cool seats which gave
massages each time the train bounced; it was a simple inexpensive
design, using an old tire on an armature on a rocker connected to the
massagey bumps in the lower back of each seat.

<p>Around 3 or 4 am I woke up from a funny dream snippet which I can&rsquo;t
remember at the moment.</p>
