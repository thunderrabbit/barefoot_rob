One train came and slammed through the car on the tracks.  Another
train came on the adjacent tracks and slammed through the car on
those tracks.  A third train came through and I knew it must be a
dream so I threw the garbage of the KKK uniforms under the train and
watched it be carried away relentlessly by the wheels unstopping and
then noticed the train was not that long so they could see it was me
and I thought good thing it's a dream and then an old black man came
by laughing and we laughed our asses off as they train curved its way
slowly around the whole valley as I started to make up straight lies
"it took them then years to finish those tracks god bless the lives
that were lost falling down the valley" and visualized under water the
skeleton not there as the lie had been told and just fish who didn't
even know what a lie *was* much less that it had been told and didn't
affect their lives in any way.

<h2 id="08-35-saturday-28-july-2018-jst">08:35 Saturday 28 July 2018 JST</h2>

<p class="dream">
There's an approach to Dallas airport over a mountain, where we fly through a mountain pass, over a ridge, right around an outcropping of rock, and then into a cave which serves as the runway.
</p>

<p class="dream">
This was my forth time to arrive on this runway, and the big screen window in front gives everyone a great view of the approach in real-time.  As usual, everyone shares the same awestruck feelings, ranging from "we are all going to die" to "wow that's amazing", but that's only from what we can see through the window.
</p>

<p class="dream">
This time, I noticed something orders of magnitude more amazing than any other time I have arrived at this airport.  As the plane flew into the cave, we didn't touch down immediately like most times.  This time the pilot slowed us down so once we actually landed, we rolled only 21 meters after wheels contacted the ground.
</p>

<p class="dream">
I pointed out to some of the other passengers who were all duly impressed with the visible parts of the landing, because I was sitting where I could see the tachometer, and how it didn't start counting until we were nearly stopped.
</p>

<p class="dream">
I stepped down off the platform and walked to where the pilots were gathering their bags and talking together.
</p>

<p class="dream">
I shouted "Captain Solo!" to get their attention with a comparison to Han Solo (and his flight skills) because I heard many passengers make the same comparison while witnessing the landing.
</p>

<p class="dream">
They looked up, and I was like "Captain, I have arrived at this airport several times, and it's always amazing, but this time I noticed how we only rolled twenty one meters after touchdown.  I'm so impressed I just had to say thank you."
</p>

<p class="dream">
The older Captain nodded with humble thanks and the younger said "be sure to prepare a present," so I immediately handed over my phone which was open on the back screen to a video clip of us standing dangerously close to the edge of the very same outcropping of rock around which we have to fly during this approach.
</p>

<p class="dream">
They smiled and said like wow nice picture how did you get that? And though it was actually a selfie, I realized it might be in an illegal location, so I was like "oh I just found it online.." and he handed the phone back, saying thanks for showing me; I hadn't seen it before.
</p>

<p>And I woke up.</p>

We were in a B52 that for some reason had to crash so they were going
to simply move all the refrigerators from one side to the other so it
would go off balance and plummet down at an angle, ensuring its
destruction so the enemy would not be able to use anything from it.

<p class="dream">While on campus at a university I needed to use the
restroom to go number 2, but all the restrooms had lines.  From
experience, I knew that the restrooms on higher floors had shorter
lines, but I had to go up to a floor I had never previously seen.</p>

<p class="dream">I got to some kind  of room with a lectern and chairs
and wanted to  see what was on  the next floor, but it  was locked.  I
could see under the door tht  someone was there, but it was apparently
a private floor.  I went around a corner and found a pair of restrooms
that were adjacent with no wall between them, and realized there was a
mirror between them so they each looked like larger rooms.</p>

<p class="dream">I chose the one with had a symbol for men on the
door, and just my luck, there was a giant turd floating in the water.
I flushed the ancient handle, but the water just went higher and the
turd was that much closer to overflow.  I tried again with more vigor
and noticed the water did go down, but only after holding the handle
down for a while.  So I held the handle and got the water down to a
manageble level and sat down to do my business.</p>

<p class="dream">The door to the next restroom opened, and lo, it was
not a mirror, but a simple shower curtain between the loos.  The woman
who came in was like, actually this toilet is for number 2 and that
one is for number 1 only.  I nodded my head politely, and she asked if
I knew what she meant.</p>

<p class="dream">"Yes, this is for number 1," holding up 1 finger,
"and that is for number 2," holding up 2 fingers as if that proved
anything.  After a moment, I explained that I used the restroom which
had the symbol for men on it.</p>

<p class="dream">She was like, "yeah that means number 1 only."</p>

<p class="dream">I said "hmm yeah well that makes sense" and I thought
about it for a while and realized "oh, but I know how to control this
toilet now. You guys designated this for pee only because sometimes
the water only rises. Not to mention, there was a giant turd in this
toilet when I came in, and I cleaned it up, so you are welcome."</p>

<p class="dream">She perked up to hear that.  "Really?  Because that
would be great," and gave me a kiss.</p>

<p>Then I woke up.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I woke up with a YRUU dream in my mind.</p>

<p class="dream">
We were somewhere and someone sang some made up lyrics
There was a new  attendee from Colorado, and we jokingly said we had
not heard of their football team, the California Nuggets.  As an
apology, someone sang
</p>

<p class="dream">
Oh my darling, oh my darling<br>
Oh my darling, Clementine<br>
We don't know the football team name<br>
but we remember you just fine.<br>
</p>

<p class="dream">
And everyone cheered.  I proposed we do an impromptu talent show with
a continuous stream of such made up lyrics.
</p>

<p><p class="dream">
We went down to the stage, but it was roped off for cleaning. I asked
the person if we could use it, but was denied.  We would have to come
back in 30 minutes.  So we all lined up and started a freestyle dance
while in line when
</p>
my alarm woke me up.</p>

<p class="dream">
I used my deodorant stone incorrectly and it just started melting
before my eyes.  I thought, well, at least I got more than the
advertised year of use out of it.
</p>

<p class="dream">
Riding in an apparently-self-driving car, I sure who was driving it.
There were no people in the front seats.  It was being controlled by
someone who could see from above, like playing a 2D video game.

<p class="dream">Walking outside, I realized I was wearing hiking
boots and was shocked that I was wearing them while walking around on
vacation.  I asked store owner if I could have a bag to put them in,
but he said he could not give me one, but I could not understand the
reason why.  I walked further and found a place to put my boots in a
locker so I did that and saw Yumi there who taking things out of her
locker and she said I could put my shoes with her stuff with kinda the
implication that her son would be able to wear them when he got older.
That's fine with me and I was glad to be barefoot again, but I
wondered if I would really never need them in the next 15 years; I do
wear them in winter sometimes!</p>

<p>Had a very interesting dream last night.  Most of the following was
transcribed in a text message to Christine while walking to the
station.</p>

<p class="dream">I was out on a field and we saw a spaceship flying
above the clouds; it was moving to and fro, and had large glowing
green and red lights illuminating large portions of the clouds around
it.  As it was coming down I was like "that's a UFO" and some people
said "don't look at it" as if that might make it go away.  I very
carefully looked at it and mentally invited them to come down.</p>

<p class="dream">It came down through the clouds and had different
lights shining in different directions not like spotlights but kind of
diffuse lights green and red.  It was a round disk that came down but
what arrived was only like just seats as if maybe of an amusement park
ride.  The seats were red and thin, like padding plywood, like a
simply a seat and then eat some small handles that look like vertical
pads, like seats and pads of a workout machine, but without the
machine.</p>

<p class="dream">I got into a seat after another girl got into one and
she was like "oh this is so cool" and after I sat down on it I had the
experience of being lifted up by the seat and for a moment was worried
that I would be like required to to fight but that did not happen. I
floated up above the field where it had been and did like a backwards
loop and then back down and then lift it up.</p>

<p>In my normal flying dreams I don&rsquo;t do loops like that so that was
different.</p>

<p class="dream">The spaceship lifted up and we were flying over a
terrain of geometric shapes and I addressed someone saying "how may I
help you, sir?" and he said "it's not sir," so I asked the question
again he reflected the question back to me, all how may he help me, so
I said I needed to be back within a few Earth minutes of when we were
picked up. He did not seem surprised by that.  OR, if possible, help
me pack all my stuff before the boat arrives, (because in the previous
moment of my dream we were just a couple days left sailing on a cruise
ship and was about to be in panic pack mode).  We were in a laboratory
and I floated around the room a little and he asked me about a
contacts case and was like "so what's this?" and I said "oh that
refracts light" and tried to describe briefly the human eyes work with
a lens and retina and he seemed interested in that, plus how something
so thin could could help someone see properly and maybe was looking at
something else and then</p>

<p>my alarm went off just a couple minutes after the dream started that
was interesting.</p>

<p><div class="dream">I got an email from my friend saying her sister had
died.  She decided to tart a new estaurnt like The Pink Cow which was
really friendly and had great food so we went there to check it out
and it was super busy so I asked them about making a reseration but it
was a bit confusing about what time we would be able to get ther
because our driver would be avaialble at 10am or 10pm and neither time
was exactly convenient</p></p>

<p>Insert lots of forgotten dream / non-REM sleep here&hellip;</p>

<p><div class="dream">Looking down at the huge elevator taking the plane
down to the launch zone, it went down toddown and then magnetic launch
zoooomm right out over the water so awesomely fast and then I was
shocked to see the plane didnt make it up to full speed and kinda
slowed down and sloshed down into the water.  They were okay and the
plane dove down into the ground and came back out in the mountain and
shook the wter out of the engine and tried again.  then it was our
turn and our plane was hurling through the hallway and the a overhead
speakder was like I think we want eleven. and I wrote that into my
diary starting a new paragraph</p></p>

<p><div class="dream">Fabulous, they said I think we want eleven WTF you
don&rsquo;t know what you want??</p></p>

<p><div class="dream">And then I went to write down the timestamp and the
clock said 1999 and the woman next to me saw it too, and then it said
19:59 and I jokingly said, okay there you go it&rsquo;s 19:59 but then it
switched to 19:65 and then 19:70 and I then I went to write that down
and could not find on the page where I had written &ldquo;Fabulous&rdquo; and then
I was like waitaminut this is a dream and woke up</p></p>
