      <description>Had an hour lesson with Liliko, during which we double checked the English for an AI game they are developing. For some reason they keep asking for confirmation of stuff on paper but it has gotten to the point that we would prefer to see the real thing in action in order to really make sure it&amp;rsquo;s all correct.
Also had a lesson with Azusa, during which we clarified some of her translation into English, changing the word &amp;ldquo;become&amp;rdquo; into &amp;ldquo;because&amp;rdquo; and stuff like replacing &amp;ldquo;addition and multiplication are done by turning the handle outside&amp;rdquo; with &amp;ldquo;to add and multiply numbers, we turn the handle clockwise,&amp;rdquo; partially because she could not consistently say &amp;ldquo;multiplication.</description>

      <description>17:29 Thursday 21 February 2019 JST Today (and most Thursdays) I taught at SCC in Kawasaki. Naoko reviewed for her test next week. Yasu reviewed the same material for his test sometime in the future. Azusa did much better with her fluency and intonation for her presentation. Liliko asked about the brochure that has to change soon to accomodate new opening times.
After the lessons I went to say HI to Tomoko and Midori, but Midori had the day off.</description>
