Afghanistan Facing &amp;ldquo;Downward Spiral&amp;rdquo;, National Intelligence Estimate Draft Report Highlights Afghanistan&amp;rsquo;s Accelerated Deterioration - CBS News
 The nearly completed National Intelligence Estimate, the work of 16 intelligence agencies, says Afghanistan&amp;rsquo;s deterioration has accelerated alarmingly in past two months. Bush administration officials say privately that Afghanistan is now the single most pressing security threat in the fight against terrorism.
 What a nightmare we&amp;rsquo;ve caused. And with this Estimate saying we have to go in there and kill &amp;lsquo;em more will just make things worse and worse.</description>

U.S. not seeking permanent Iraq bases, ambassador says - International Herald Tribune
 The United States ambassador to Iraq dismissed any suggestion on Thursday that the Bush administration was maneuvering to set up permanent military bases in Iraq.

Save Jerusalem from the Apartheid Wall and Ethnic cleansing
 In an attempt to disrupt this unity among Palestinians on both sides of the Armistice Line, the Wall has been built right down the middle of the village, separating families and neighbors, shopkeepers and customers from their markets, people from their work, and children from their schools. 216 shops and houses have been demolished close to where the Wall has been built.</description>

This was actually sent to me a long time ago, but I&amp;rsquo;m just now getting it posted
 Hi All, it&amp;rsquo;s been a while I know! Partly my lack of emails is because i&amp;rsquo;m not very good at keeping in touch (as pointed out very clearly by my sister last week!) and partly because I didn&amp;rsquo;t think I had that much to report. I&amp;rsquo;m settled here now and my life has it&amp;rsquo;s routine just like it did in the UK.</description>

&amp;lsquo;Virtual Fence&amp;rsquo; Along Border To Be Delayed - washingtonpost.com
 Boeing has already been paid $20.6 million for the pilot project, and in December, the DHS gave the firm another $65 million to replace the software with military-style, battle management software.
 This, for some reason, seems shocking to me. Okay, so this is for a virtual fence 28 miles long. The $20.6 million price works out to almost $140 / foot.</description>

Maverick Republican Drops WC Bomb on Bush/Cheney
 After passing out copies of the second chapter of Patrick Buchanan&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Day of Reckoning&amp;rdquo;- as supporting evidence, Vaillancourt opened his remarks quoting &amp;ldquo;fools rush in where wise men fear to tread&amp;rdquo;-, and it sounded like a set up to condemn a rush to impeach. But instead he said that Betty Hall is neither fool nor wise man, but is a model of courage and that her impeachment resolution should be supported.</description>

 It was not clear how long ago the satellite lost power, or under what circumstances.
 Discovery News : Spy Satellite Could Crash to Earth
It&amp;rsquo;s a spy satellite!! How can they not know when it lost power? It seems more likely that someone knows quite well exactly when it lost power, but just didn&amp;rsquo;t say anything publicly.
BUT&amp;hellip;. maybe there are just so many spy satellites all on autopilot that someone didn&amp;rsquo;t notice?</description>

 The bombardment near the Arab Jabour area on the southern outskirts of Baghdad is part of a new countrywide push against insurgents called Operation Phantom Phoenix,&amp;hellip;
 The official said the area is one of the last insurgent &amp;ldquo;safe havens&amp;rdquo; in the agricultural region that includes sprawling fields and farmlands.
I&amp;rsquo;m sure if it includes farmlands, it includes farm houses and innocent Iraqis.</description>

Hello Family and Friends&amp;hellip;
I am back in the states after my 7 month trip to Southern Mexico where I spent mid July until December learning from and photographing the incredible uprising occurring in Oaxaca followed by two months in Chiapas. In Olympia this week, through photos, video clips, and stories, I hope to share the spirit and creativity of the teachers strike turned full scale popular rebellion that managed to take control of the city for multiple months demanding the resignation of the corrupt state governor, Ulises Ruiz Ortiz.</description>

hello all&amp;hellip;
It has been quite some time since I sent out a report from my time here in Chiapas. I have been working with Frayba, a human rights organization that sends internationals into Zapatista and other indigenous communities to do peace observing work, documenting any threats or actions against the communities by paramilitaries as well as any movement by the Mexican military. It has been an incredible experience and I am hoping to spend two more weeks in a community before I begin the long road home.</description>

The repression by the Mexican government that I described on the 25th has continued. On October 29th the government leaked that they had compiled a list of 100 internationals from video footage who they alleged were committing vandalism alongside the movement and who they intended to deport.</description>

Kintbury, EnglandIN the autumn of 68 B.C. the world&amp;rsquo;s only military superpower was dealt a profound psychological blow by a daring terrorist attack on its very heart. Rome&amp;rsquo;s port at Ostia was set on fire, the consular war fleet destroyed, and two prominent senators, together with their bodyguards and staff, kidnapped.</description>

Hello family and friends&amp;hellip;
I am sorry it has been awhile since I sent an e-mail. I have been able to get a few pieces published and have been focusing on writing for those. I have thought about sending them out to this list but I fear they would be repetitive. There is so little information out there that each piece I write has a lot of the same background information.</description>

I do not buy that 911 was an inside job by the government. I can buy that the Neocons in the Bush admin potentially knew something was up and did nothing in order to create public sentiment that would rally behind the flag and agree to their extreme foriegn policy agenda, but that&amp;rsquo;s a far cry from orchestrating the event and attacking your own nation with missiles, etc.</description>

from Rochelle:
hello all! The teachers and their supporters continue to remain strong in the face of nightly acts of repression. The police and government goons shot up the transmitter for channel 9, shutting down the state tv that the the women from the movement had controlled since the 1st of August. Immediately stations all over the city were taken over. In the last two nights two teachers have been killed by government forces while protecting those stations.</description>

Hello all…
So things in Oaxaca are intensifying and fast.
Last week there was a 2000+ womens&amp;rsquo; march of the Popular Assembly of the
State of Oaxaca (APPO). A quick recap, this is the organization that
formed after the June 14th police repression of the striking teachers
union SNTE Section 22. APPO is made up of the teachers as well as a huge
variety of social organizations who support the teachers.</description>

 the civilized hijackings of the seventies are over. if guy says he has a bomb, you&amp;rsquo;re all going to die anyway&amp;ndash;bum rush him. problem solved, just like on united 93. no need for extra security, we can take care of things ourselves.
 That is from a thread between me, Dude and my brother after the announcement that we can&amp;rsquo;t bring drinks onto planes anymore:</description>

By now you may be aware that I am in Jerusalem with the four other delegates from the Olympia-Rafah Sister City Project, and Cindy and Craig Corrie. We chose to leave Gaza Wednesday morning after two men came to our apartment late Tuesday night asking us to go with them under the false pretense that we would be safer staying in their home. Our host in Rafah recognized this as an attempt to kidnap us and cautiously navigated the situation resulting in the bizarre scenario of the men shaking each of our hands and leaving.</description>

 With an absurd system for color-coding dangers to Americans, the President, Vice President, and the highest officials in this land were able to paint the media a &amp;ldquo;high&amp;rdquo; incendiary orange and the Democrats an &amp;ldquo;elevated&amp;rdquo; bright yellow, functionally sidelining them. How stunningly in recent weeks the landscape has altered&amp;hellip;

Hello world!
In the past couple weeks, I&amp;rsquo;ve witnessed two and a half particularly interesting things.
1) One was the anti-climatic detonation of what turned out to be a fake grenade found by a Palestinian farmer near the olive trees we were helping him harvest.
He showed us the grenade, which looked real enough to warrant concern. It had been partially buried with its pin removed, and two stones covering it.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to write a few lines about what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in the West Bank, though I have not actually picked olives yet.
I have a feeling this will be a long message, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to write it in sections, and may follow up with other sections soon.
======================= Section One: Vocabulary
When I first arrived here, I did not know the meaning / differences between &amp;ldquo;West Bank&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Gaza.</description>
