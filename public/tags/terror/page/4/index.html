                        <p>##20:38 Friday 06 January 2006</p>

<p>By now you may be aware that I am in Jerusalem with the four other delegates from the Olympia-Rafah Sister City Project, and Cindy and Craig Corrie. We chose to leave Gaza Wednesday morning after two men came to our apartment late Tuesday night asking us to go with them under the false pretense that we would be safer staying in their home. Our host in Rafah recognized this as an attempt to kidnap us and cautiously navigated the situation resulting in the bizarre scenario of the men shaking each of our hands and leaving. Though this experience was nerve-wracking at no point did I feel I was in any physical danger.</p>

<p>Kidnapping of foreigners has become increasingly common throughout the past month as the upcoming legislative elections get closer. The past week and a half in Rafah much of our time was spent discussing our safety.  Our Palestinian friends in Rafah were very attentive and aware of the developing situation. Together with their support and guidance we attempted to navigate these unfortunate circumstances. Earlier on the day this incident occurred, our friends in Rafah strongly recommended that we leave for our own safety. Based on their concerns we had agreed to leave earlier than expected, though our rapid good-byes came more quickly than anticipated after our attempted kidnapping.</p>

<p>I meant to send out this report before this incident took place, but as circumstances in Gaza have become increasingly unstable and our situation shifted daily I found myself constantly having to update this report. I have decided to send it now as I think it contextualizes our attempted kidnapping in this pre-election period.</p>

<p>Last week as I sat in the Internet café a block from my apartment in Rafah reading the latest news from throughout Gaza and the West Bank I was left feeling vulnerable and uncertain. I was struck by how chaotic and unruly it all sounded, yet sitting there quietly reading and writing, being served free cups of hot tea by the young men who run the café, the stories on the screen felt distant and unrelated to my reality.</p>

<p>It had been difficult for me to write these past few weeks. I think it had to do with the fact that I felt more settled in, more at home. I had my routine. Each morning I woke up, stretched, made a pot of Turkish coffee on our one electric stove and headed out to a meeting, presentation, or some other sort of social gathering. The ability to create a routine in the midst of an uncertain, potentially dangerous situation grounded me. At the same time I was left feeling disoriented and disconnected from the events surrounding me.</p>

<p>I know the work I am doing, helping establish various cross-cultural projects, for example creating a network to sell women’s fair trade embroidery in Olympia or facilitating the connection between an elementary school class in Rafah and a school in Olympia, is a part of a larger vision. I know that this work is one project of many designed to educate people in the US about Palestine and the role the US government plays in continuing the occupation here. And as my friends in Rafah emphasize, educate people in Palestine about the American people and those of us who oppose the actions of the US government. But it is hard sometimes to feel that all of these things are in any way related to the daily realities of life in Gaza.</p>

<p>Daily I saw or heard second hand about the latest unrest in Gaza. The almost nightly bombings that have taken place over northern Gaza, the targeted assassinations, the implementation and blatant redeployment by the Israeli military of a “no-go zone” stretching 1.5 miles inside of Gaza on the northern and eastern boarders. The daily take-over of Palestinian electoral offices by various Palestinian factions angry over broken promises of jobs and positions of authority with in the PA (Palestinian Authority). Last week&rsquo;s news of two men killed by the IOF (Israeli Occupation Force) for being within the “no go zone”. News of two Islamic Jihad members killed by an apache helicopter air strike as they were driving in Gaza City one evening. The events taking place in Gaza are endless, one follows the other faster than I can learn about what is taking place.</p>

<p>Two weeks ago, as we drove out of Rafah heading towards Gaza City I looked out the window of the taxi and saw armed Palestinian police in their blue uniforms surrounding a group of masked men leaning against a near-by wall. I later learned that the men were demanding space on the ballot of the upcoming legislative elections scheduled to take place January 25th. With the run up to the elections tension mounts daily as gun fights and election office take-overs are increasingly common.</p>

<p>Even as I see glimpses of the reality, laying in bed reading while listening nightly to the shelling and bombing over Gaza City. Holding in my hand the one notice of warning Israel has given to those living and working inside the area Israel has declared a “no go zone”. It reads: “Residents of Northern Gaza, terrorists are launching missiles from beside your houses. The IDF (Israel Defense Force) is working to defend the security of Israel and they will continue pursuing the terrorists. You must leave this area. Staying will put your lives in danger. IDF Leadership.” Or walking through downtown Rafah as a parade of Palestinian police cars and trucks crammed full of police men with guns occasionally shooting into the air in an attempt to clear the traffic from their path as they mourned the loss of a fellow police officer earlier in the week. I still felt on the periphery of all that was taking place.</p>

<p>But every now and again an experience or story would jolt me back into what it really meant to be living Gaza. I felt this more strongly in the past few days, as the unstable situation in Gaza has resulted more and more frequently in the kidnapping of foreigners.</p>

<p>Last Wednesday three Brits were kidnapped as they entered Gaza from Rafah Crossing. I am relieved to say that on Friday they were released unharmed and the woman who was kidnapped and has been working in Gaza for the past year will continue her work here. I breathed a sign of relief upon hearing this news. But almost a quickly as my concerns were dispelled news of another kidnapping surfaced. The man, Italian, was released unharmed in a matter of hours after the PA took an active role in securing his release. These incidents heightened our awareness of our surroundings and sparked many conversations and concern from Palestinians regarding our safety.</p>

<p>Listening to the concerns and advice from our friends in Rafah, we had made the decision Tuesday afternoon to leave Gaza by the end of the week. Our remaining time in Rafah was shortened even further after the attempted kidnapping we experienced Tuesday night. As we said rapid good-byes to the few friends who were able to see us off I still could not process that we were leaving. Our time in Rafah was cut short and it was painful to leave all the people I have come to know and love, yet the two months we were able to spend there were amazing.</p>

<p>We accomplished many of the goals we began with and laid the foundation for continued cooperation and cross-cultural connection to take place. Continuing this work is extremely important and sends a strong message of our commitment to solidarity with the Palestinian people in spite of the action of a small sector of the population carrying out the kidnappings. The act of kidnapping foreigners will not deter us from our commitment to the Palestine people, and the people of Rafah in particular.</p>

<p>We will continue to work in solidarity with Palestinians as stopping sets a precedent for internationals to discontinue their work in Gaza. Such actions would send the message that the acts of a few have the potential to dismantle years of energy put towards building trust and understanding between Palestinian’s and internationals in Gaza. We will continue to foster the friendships we made during our two months in Rafah and find creative ways to carry out the projects we began despite our rapid departure.</p>

<p>I feel incredibly supported by the friends we have made in Rafah. They gave all their spare time to accompanying us when we traveled and constantly checked in with us wanting to know that we were okay when they were not around. As one friend put it, “We will provide you with security not with weapons, but with our friendship and love”</p>

<p>The kidnappings taking place in Gaza are different and unrelated to the kidnappings taking place in Iraq. They are a part of the internal power struggle in Gaza. The majority of kidnappings have been used to pressure the PA for jobs within the Authority, or to secure the release of friends or family jailed by the PA. In Iraq kidnappings are employed to release prisoners held by the US or to demand an end to the Occupation.  In Iraq kidnappings are used as collateral to pressure an external power whose control is not affected by the kidnappings. Yes, it represents the sense of chaos and lack of control the US maintains over Iraq, but the media uses it to justify the continued occupation under the guise of achieving security before leaving. The US will not give in to the demands of the kidnappers as they feel it will display a weakness in US foreign policy.</p>

<p>Kidnappings in Gaza are primarily used to put pressure on the internal power players, namely the Palestinian Authority. In the eyes of the international community these acts do not benefit the PA in any way, but rather undermine their legitimacy. The media is more than willing to uses the kidnappings to discredit the PA. Saying such things as “mayhem in the Gaza Strip&hellip;.has embarrassed Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, threatening to undermine his Fatah Party…”</p>

<p>It doesn’t take much thought to determine that the rationale of kidnapping foreigners to be used as bargaining chips in Gaza are borrowed from Iraqi resistance to the US occupation, but the goals and politics behind them differ. The phenomenon of kidnapping in Gaza is new. It had been the topic of conversation everywhere we went in Rafah and without fail the people we met condemn these acts. My analysis about this is in no way comprehensive but having spent countless hours with dozens of Palestinians discussing this I feel I should share some of what I heard.</p>

<p>Many people I have spoken with see the kidnappings as a sign of unrest due to the upcoming elections. It is one aspect of the larger climate that has developed here during the election season. This is a phase, growing pains that Palestine is experiencing as it attempts to hold its first legislative elections since 1996. People have hope that post-election the situation will change, as a governmental structure will take shape challenging the unruly atmosphere that currently exists. There is still talk of the elections being canceled though people remain optimistic that they will take place.</p>

<p>Last summer&rsquo;s Israeli disengagement, or rather, redeployment left a power vacuum leading various political factions jockeying for control. The PA has been weakened and the Palestinian public views it with skepticism because of internal corruption as well as Israel successfully undermining their credibility through such policies as unilateral decision making. Despite Israel&rsquo;s redeployment it has continued to exploit the daily lawlessness in Palestine and Gaza in particular. With threats to prohibit Palestinians in East Jerusalem from voting due to Hamas&rsquo; participation in the elections, with the creation of a &ldquo;no go zone&rdquo;, targeted assassinations as I mentioned earlier, and on and on the occupation of Gaza and the West Bank undoubtedly play a role in the ensuing state of unrest in Gaza.</p>

<p>To expect that Palestine, lacking status as an independent country, can effectively hold elections while under military occupation is unrealistic. I hear criticism of the PA for not controlling the unfolding events taking place in Gaza but the inability of the PA to govern Gaza is not purely a home grow problem. Yes, there is corruption within the PA contributing to its ineffectiveness, but one cannot deny the role Israel has played in undermining its ability to establish any sort of credible and therefore effective government. Due in large part to the continued Israeli occupation the PA is unable to provide basic services and meet the needs of the people. This has ripened the playing field for others to step up to bat.  In this pre-election season we see these power struggles playing out in the streets, in electoral offices, and in the use of foreigners to pressure the PA to acknowledge the interests of individuals and groups.</p>

<p>It is an intense but fascinating time to be in Palestine. In spite of the kidnapping attempt I am thankful that I was able to experience some of what it is like to be in a place where people feel passionate about their lives, their hope for freedom and for a better future. I do not agree with many of the tactics employed by various Palestinian factions but I cannot deny that there is much more participation in the political process in Palestine than in the United States.</p>

<p>As the international media continues to portray the instability in Gaza as solely the fault of the PA and armed militant groups we must recognize the role our government and the Israeli government&rsquo;s policies have played in creating the events now unfolding. In this globalized world we have the ability to witness and support grassroots movement for justice taking place all over the world. Building relationships with those whom our government categorizes as &ldquo;terrorists&rdquo; or &ldquo;communists&rdquo; breaks down these generalizations and lays the foundation for trust to be fostered. I have experienced the strength and power this work holds and have see the positive impact of even the simplest acts of solidarity.</p>

                        <p>##19:02 Sunday 20 November 2005</p>

<p>Hello world!</p>

<p>In the past couple weeks, I&rsquo;ve witnessed two and a half particularly interesting things.</p>

<p>1) One was the anti-climatic detonation of what turned out to be a fake grenade found by a Palestinian farmer near the olive trees we were helping him harvest.</p>

<p>He showed us the grenade, which looked real enough to warrant concern.  It had been partially buried with its pin removed, and two stones covering it.  The farmer thought the grenade may be live, planted as a landmine of sorts.</p>

<p>We called the Israeli Defense Force, who sent a couple of armored jeeps out the next day.  The soldiers placed a charge near the grenade with the intent of detonating the grenade via their remotely detonated charge.  We hid behind one of the jeeps when the charge was detonated.</p>

<p>A quick BAM, and some smoke; it was over.  The grenade had been a fake, they said.</p>

<p>I semi-jestfully apologized for &ldquo;making them come out&rdquo; though the grenade was fake.  One of the soldiers basically said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry; just doing our job.&rdquo;</p>

<p>None of us had to sign any papers, make any statements, or anything.  The soldiers packed up and left.  We inspected the small hole and dug for remains of the grenade, then left as well.</p>

<p>It seems to me that this should be a big deal.  There shouldn&rsquo;t be a nonchalant attitude about a grenade being found in a field.  They didn&rsquo;t ask us any questions; they didn&rsquo;t cordon off the area (except during their actual detonation); they didn&rsquo;t hunt for clues; they just came out, DESTROYED A GRENADE, and left.</p>

<p>There is a video of the detonation at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/?v=xr3H_AlHPhU">https://www.youtube.com/?v=xr3H_AlHPhU</a>, and on my website with some pictures from the day at <a href="https://robnugen.com/cgi-local/journal.pl?type=all&date;=2005/10/31#Today">https://robnugen.com/cgi-local/journal.pl?type=all&date;=2005/10/31#Today</a></p>

<p>2) The second interesting thing happened quite close to the hostel where I&rsquo;m staying in Jerusalem.  Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not unusual that we hear soundbombs used near Damascus Gate, which is visible from the hostel&rsquo;s lounge window.  Soundbombs are not &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; per se, but the Israeli border police and soldiers use them to disperse crowds.</p>

<p>We heard a quick succession of perhaps 8 soundbombs, which sent several of us outside with video cameras to see what we could record.</p>

<p>I thought everything was over (I went out rather later than the others) when one last soundbomb was thrown.  I can only imagine the soldier who threw it must have been in an adrenaline-filled state, and not thinking clearly.  It landed quite near 4 or 5 young girls who had been walking up the road in a carefree way.</p>

<p>The video I took is here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/?v=LVVGTnaNZns">https://www.youtube.com/?v=LVVGTnaNZns</a></p>

<p>Afterward, my friend David confronted someone who seemed to be in charge of the action, saying it was inappropriate to throw soundbombs so close to innocents.  This man angrily replied that rocks had been thrown at an innocent Jewish man, and that we Political Activists were only showing one side of the story; why weren&rsquo;t we videoing the Jew who had been hurt?</p>

<p>As I recorded David talking to the Jewish man (who had a bit of blood on his nose, not really visible in the video), the angry soldier yelled at me, but I didn&rsquo;t respond.</p>

<p>Here is the video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/?v=0vzUttSNzvU">https://www.youtube.com/?v=0vzUttSNzvU</a></p>

<p>3) The third thing happened yesterday.  I saw it from afar, but couldn&rsquo;t make myself go; it felt too dangerous.  A Palestinian family&rsquo;s house was being demolished for &ldquo;security reasons,&rdquo; according to the soldier who was asked.  The family had been given 24 hours notice.</p>

<p>My friends Juliet and Ben went to see what has happening.  Juliet had stones thrown at her by Palestinian kids when she was near the soldiers.  The video Juliet took features the wife wailing-crying-screaming at her life being destroyed before her eyes.  The Arab speakers here said she was blaming Ariel Sharon and others for her plight.  Juliet didn&rsquo;t record the husband screaming angrily at her, though people on the scene said he was yelling, &ldquo;why couldn&rsquo;t you come earlier?  Why are you here now [that it&rsquo;s too late]?  Why didn&rsquo;t you stop this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ben wrote</p>

<p>Last Monday I went on a tour of East Jerusalem with an Israeli
Jewish group called ICAHD (Israeli Committee Against Housing
Demolitions).  On the way home our guide received a text alert on
his phone about a house demolition in the West Bank town of Anata
that was about to occur.  We could see from the highway across the
valley two large excavators with hydraulic hammer attachments
surrounded by soldiers pushing back a crowd.  We couldn&rsquo;t tell
which building it was that was going to be demolished.  Only three
of us were willing to go and witness this, so we were dropped off
up the highway at the entrance to the town and rushed to the site
where the demolition was already under way.  There were 20-30
children on the road, some throwing stones at the soldiers
standing guard, a hundred Palestinians with soldiers blocking them
encircling the entire site, and just as many on rooftops.  I split
up from the other two and headed to the uphill side of the
building to get a good perspective.* It was a three story
apartment building and it took about an hour for the machines to
knock the whole thing down.</p>

<p>The two excavators made a terrible noise as the two hydraulic
hammers slammed the concrete and sections of the floor suddenly
gave way.  As it started to get dark I decided it would be a good
idea to get home, and as I walked back through the streets it
occurred to me that the three of us were the only internationals
I&rsquo;d seen.  It seems to me now that one advantage to the
authorities of not issuing warning of the demolition is that this
most likely prevents any international media from being there.
And there wasn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t go; it sounds really traumatizing.</p>

<p>4) After my last email, I got a few replies that asked some of the same questions.</p>

<p>*) I forgot to specify that a stone had hit me, not a rubber bullet.</p>

<p>*) I described Palestine as &ldquo;a country basically surrounded by Israel.&rdquo;  A better description would be &ldquo;Occupied Territories of Palestine,&rdquo; as it&rsquo;s not a country as such, and it&rsquo;s not surrounded.</p>

<p>5) Over the past two days I have been practicing peace within myself via meditation, reading (<em>Life of Pi</em>), writing, and folding origami.  I&rsquo;ve been releasing the ingrained ideas that I need to be &ldquo;doing something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>6) However, yesterday, Ben, Dave and I went to the Dead Sea and had a fantastic time!  We went to En Gedi Beach, which is free (except for transportation out there) if one brings food.  We delighted in the incredible buoyancy and decided we could easily swim to Jordan.  If we became tired on the way, we could simply rest, floating effortlessly with our heads well out of the water.</p>

<p>After our swim, we met a woman named Delphine from Switzerland and chatted with her while I let the water dry on my skin, leaving a layer of salt crystals on my shoulder and some in my beard.  (I haven&rsquo;t shaved since I left Japan on 6 October.)  We decided to take a mud bath, and turned ourselves into mud versions of The Fantastic Four, or a dark hue of Blue Man Group.  I debated letting Francois (my stuffed rabbit) get coated, but didn&rsquo;t want to risk having him rot if I couldn&rsquo;t wash all the mud out.</p>

<p>Several pictures from Dead Sea and a longer version of the story are here:

<p>7) Just tonight, I went to Bethlehem with my friend Niveen!!  We had some problems getting through the new checkpoint, a brand new facility that opened yesterday according to my friend Sarah who has been going to and from Bethlehem almost every day during her stay in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Niveen was disallowed to drive through, causing her great consternation and a U-turn with no idea how we could get in.  We jumped onto a servis (group taxi), hoping they could get through.  Actually they could not, but dropped us off at the walk-in gate, outside a brand new facility that looks a lot like a modernized cattle-herding hanger.  We were monitored by soldiers on ramparts, blocked by rotating gates (that were remotely locked after a few people went through), required to show our IDs to people behind thick (bullet proof?) glass, where Niveen (and all other Palestinians) will have their IDs entered into a computer.</p>

<p>There were several people in line, and one guy said he knew a shortcut, which turned out to be walking through the drive-through gate where we had been stopped before.  I just walked through without acknowledging the guards until they used English and Niveen called my name.  I still didn&rsquo;t show them my ID but stood there &ldquo;impatiently&rdquo; waiting for Niveen who pleaded her case until finally we were waived through.</p>

<p>We walked through the massive gate in the wall (big enough for tour buses) and quickly found a servis to take us to Bethlehem University (where Niveen went to school).  We saw some of her friends (and one of mine!) and then visited the Church of the Nativity, where I got a picture of Francois on the site where Jesus is said to have been born.</p>

<p>This was all great and fantastic and I was really happy to get this crown jewel of a Francois photo (though Sarah says I should have put him <em>in</em> the hole) before I left for home.</p>

<p>On the way back through the checkpoint, I was astonished that all the passengers on tour buses had to get OUT of the tour bus, wait in the spanking new cattle herding facility, then get back ON the tour bus, for a grand total of moving about 100 yards in 30 minutes.</p>

<p>We waited in line, chatting with several other Americans who were on a tour, and marveled at the facility.  It&rsquo;s literally like going between countries, not between cities.  I stood in line with Niveen, whereas passport holders could just show their passport and walk through a gate (so I don&rsquo;t know what was taking so long at first).  In a non-violent act against the facility, I tried to walk through the gate, found it locked, so I jumped over it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I turned around after a couple of &ldquo;heys&rdquo; and said, &ldquo;what?&rdquo; like &ldquo;who are you to talk to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The guy was like &ldquo;where&rsquo;s your passport?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked him in the eyes.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in my pocket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Show me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No way am I showing you my passport.  My taxes <em>paid</em> for this facility (*)&rdquo; I glared into his eyes until he grabbed my arm as if to show me who was boss.</p>

<p>I pulled away and was like, &ldquo;alright, look,&rdquo; and showed him my passport.  He took it and I tried to snatch it back from him and then pulled his arm and he looked back at me like, &ldquo;are you daring to challenge my authority?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I backed off and he gave my passport to the guy behind the glass.</p>

<p>I said something like, &ldquo;this is ridiculous; there&rsquo;s no reason to make these people wait here; this is completely preposterous,&rdquo; by which time my passport was checked and put back under the glass where the guy I had challenged motioned toward it with his head, ignoring everything I said.</p>

<p>This is definitely a situation after which I thought of several things I could have said better at the moment.</p>

<p>I am pretty sure I would not have done it had there <em>not</em> been about 50 American tourists there watching everything.  I basically just wanted to make a scene and get across the point that the checkpoint makes people resentful.</p>

<p>(*) strictly speaking I can&rsquo;t prove this is true, but I know the US gives money to Israel.</p>

<p>8) I&rsquo;ll be leaving this area on the 17th, and back in Japan the next day.</p>

                        <p>##04:53 Saturday 29 October 2005</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to write a few lines about what I&rsquo;ve seen in the West Bank, though I have not actually picked olives yet.</p>

<p>I have a feeling this will be a long message, so I&rsquo;m going to write it in sections, and may follow up with other sections soon.</p>

<p>=======================
Section One: Vocabulary</p>

<p>When I first arrived here, I did not know the meaning / differences between &ldquo;West Bank&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gaza.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The following are my definitions, and people may disagree with them.</p>

<p>Israel: a small country between the Mediterranean Sea on the west and Jordan on the east.</p>

<p>Palestine: an even smaller country that is basically surrounded by Israel.  Palestine is basically separated into two parts.  The parts are &ldquo;West Bank&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gaza&rdquo; (or &ldquo;Gaza Strip&rdquo;).</p>

<p>West Bank: the larger section of Palestine, which is on the west bank of the Jordan river.  Hence the name, I believe.</p>

<p>Gaza: the smaller section of Palestine, on the Mediterranean Sea.</p>

<p>Occupation: Israeli soldiers with M-16 (?) machine guns are ever-present in Palestine streets (and possibly Israel, but I haven&rsquo;t been there).  In my experience, they are generally quiet, but will answer questions if I ask.  Often they say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; I&rsquo;m not from this area.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Checkpoints: Blockade or toll-plaza type places in the streets and highways where traffic is stopped and checked by Israeli soldiers. Some checkpoints completely disallow vehicular traffic from passing. (*) see Qalandia Checkpoint below.</p>

<p>Flying Checkpoints: same as checkpoints, but erected on the whim of the Israeli army.  I have seen these on highways, on sidewalks, on city streets.</p>

<p>Settlers: Israeli citizens who (often for financial reasons) are given housing from the Israeli government.  They are placed in areas that would otherwise be called Palestine (according to my definition above).  I have not met any settlers, but have heard some horrific stories of unchecked settler aggression toward Palestinians and Internationals.</p>

<p>Internationals: people who are not from Israel or Palestine, but who would like to help stop the occupation of Palestine.</p>

<p>Olive Harvest: &lsquo;tis the season farmers pick olives from trees. Sometimes settlers challenge Palestinian farmers for rights to the land.  When Internationals are present with video cameras, settlers seem less likely to be violent.</p>

<p>Refugee Camps: poor, cramped cities where displaced Palestinians have been moved when Israel was formed, or more recently as Israel has grown into previously Palestinian areas.</p>

<p>Apartheid: unequal application of rules / laws to racially separate people.  From South Africa, but has been used to describe the situation in Israel/Palestine.</p>

<p>Security Fence:
Separation Barrier:
Apartheid Wall:  a fence / wall 8 meters tall being constructed around Palestine.</p>

<p>further reading: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid_wall">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid_wall</a></p>

<p>Intifada: An uprising of Palestinians against the apartheid in which they have been living.  The first Intifada was from 1987 to 1992ish. The second Intifada started in 2000, and is or is not finished depending on who one asks.</p>

<p>=================================
Section Two:  Qalandia Checkpoint</p>

<p>I have been living in Faisal Hostel in Jerusalem.  It&rsquo;s near the Old City of Jerusalem, where Jesus carried the cross before his crucifixion back in the day.</p>

<p>Ramallah is a city about 18 kilometers (11 miles) north of Jerusalem. Ramallah means hill of God.</p>

<p>There is a highway between Ramallah and Jerusalem, which would make the trip take about 15 minutes by car.</p>

<p>However, there is a checkpoint on the highway, through which vehicles may not pass.</p>

<p>To go from Jerusalem to Ramallah, everyone must get out of the vehicle (taxi or bus, unless someone has a friend to drive their personal car away) walk 100 meters past guards and through a one way gate, then secure another vehicle to go the remaining 5 minutes to Ramallah.</p>

<p>To get from Ramallah to Jerusalem, everyone must get out of the vehicle, walk 50 meters, go through a one way gate, through a metal detector, show passport or ID to the soldiers, and then the remaining 50 meters to secure another vehicle on the other side.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s called Qalandia Checkpoint, and rumor has suggested the security could get even tighter on the way from Jerusalem to Ramallah.</p>

<p>==================
Section Three: ISM</p>

<p>ISM stands for International Solidarity Movement.  Their basic idea involves having Internationals come to Palestine to stand with Palestinians during the riotous Intifada.  Because the Intifada is no longer riotous, and many &ldquo;hard core&rdquo; ISMers have been blacklisted and cannot return to the country, ISM will reformulate itself after this year&rsquo;s olive harvest.</p>

<p>I came to Palestine with the intention of joining other ISMers in supporting the olive harvest.  At the training, I was surprised at the content of the training.  We spent a great deal of time on topics like protecting ourselves from tear gas, rubber bullets, and sound bombs. We did role plays of de-arresting people by dogpiling a person the soldiers are trying to arrest.  We spent a great deal of time learning about our rights and about the chances of being arrested, what to expect, and what to do in case we are arrested.</p>

<p>At the end, we came to the final question: &ldquo;okay, where do you want to go harvest olives?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I decided I was not ready to put myself into a situation where I might be arrested.  More specifically, I didn&rsquo;t want to be deported without the chance of return.</p>

<p>================================
Section Four: Palestinian Vision</p>

<p>Instead of being an Activist, I have focused on being a writer.  Part of that time has been writing and editing reports and grant requests for Palestinian Vision, an NGO that focuses on empowering Palestinian Youth to help them focus on living instead of being oppressed.</p>

<p>I learned of PalVision semi-directly from my voyage on Peace Boat. Niveen and Eilat were selected by PalVision to sail on Peace Boat and represent youth voices in this conflict.  Niveen&rsquo;s passionate story brought me to Palestine to see for myself what&rsquo;s going on.</p>

<p>====================
Section Five: Bil&rsquo;in</p>

<p>Residents of a village called Bil&rsquo;in gather every Friday (the first day of their weekend) to peacefully protest construction of a wall that (once completed) will separate the village from 60% of its farmland, which will be given to the nearby Israeli settlement.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been to this demonstration twice, not as an active participant, but as a photographer and videographer.  Each week, approximately the same thing happened: soldiers stood in full riot gear at the top of a hill while villagers and at least as many internationals chanted in Arabic and held signs.  I was one of many recording the event, basically ignored by everyone involved.</p>

<p>After the chanting, the demonstration splits up into people who go home, and people who spread out over the land.  The soldiers spread out with them.  Some people (who may be a villagers or may be Israeli sympathetic and trying to stir up trouble) throw rocks at the soldiers who wait for a bit and then shoot rubber bullets and tear gas at the rock throwers.</p>

<p>The first time I attended (two weeks ago), I tried to stay well away from the conflict, but at one point found myself right in the middle of it!  Unfortunately with dead batteries in both my still camera and video camera because I had recorded so much other stuff.  I wasn&rsquo;t hit by anything, but I did get a couple long moments with tear gas.</p>

<p>The second time I attended (last week), I recorded some of the action, and then honestly got rather bored and just sat near the top of the hill near where some soldiers were standing around waiting for instruction.</p>

<p>Suddenly, <em>!<em>WHAM</em>!</em> I felt a shocking blow on my shoulder!  It was more surprising than painful, but had it hit <em>anywhere</em> else on my body, it would have produced serious pain and likely injury.  It struck exactly on the muscle between my neck and shoulder.  Truly thankful, truly blessed, I thanked my angels for the easy lesson.</p>

<p>(it was a stone)</p>

<p>Several soldiers came to ask if I was okay; I assured everyone I was fine.</p>

<p>The week before, a man named Joe was hit by a stone in the stomach. Palestinian doctors repaired his spleen and stapled the incision shut on his abdomen.  He is sitting across from me and showed everyone his scar - about five inches long.</p>

<p>====================</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s enough for one installment.  Blessings and love to all.</p>
