      <description>19:47 Friday 27 October 2017 JST For a couple weeks I tracked each yen spent, but I got behind yesterday and just cannot bear to catch up today. Blarg it&amp;rsquo;s neverending and what is the value? To keep me from spending money because it&amp;rsquo;s moe joe to track it?
Ironically, after I got paid I started to spend more, but mostly it was cause my phone died and I got behind.</description>

      <description>20:38 Thursday 06 October 2016 JST There&amp;rsquo;s a stinkin&amp;rsquo; gray line in the design, and I can&amp;rsquo;t find it in the CSS. They want me to get rid of it, and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how to find it. I didn&amp;rsquo;t search online, but that may be my next step. But what search terms will work for this???</description>
