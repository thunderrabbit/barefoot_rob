      <description>07:18 Friday 15 September 2017 JST Ugh. I previously uploaded version 2.2.1 of an iOS app. This time I uploaded 2.2.3 and the reply was &amp;ldquo;Oh you already uploaded version 2.2.3&amp;rdquo;
Fine ffs so I boosted the version to 2.2.4 and uploaded it.
Now they say the version number must be higher than 2.21.
I never uploaded 2.21!!111 I uploaded 2.2.1. WTF kinda checks are they doing? This is sofa king annoying.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m trying to test the In-App Purchases for our new app, but for some reason all the descriptions are off. When I click this one it buys that one and when I buy that one it buys the other one. I thought I had all this shit worked out.
##13:02
Got it worked out. Apparently Apple returns the list of products in alphabetical order instead of by the order I list them in my code.</description>

Went to Tariq&amp;rsquo;s tonight to try getting progress on uploading an app using Testflight just so we can test it during development.
And today, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even get that far.
##12:50 Monday 03 November 2014 JST
Wow!
I got a call from Apple today. Harumi explained that I need to create the app in itunesconnect in order to deploy it over TestFlight. This is different than before Apple bought TestFlight.</description>
