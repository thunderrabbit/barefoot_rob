<ol>
<li>I started a Meetup group
<a href="https://www.meetup.com/ManKind-Project-Tokyo/">ManKind Project Tokyo</a>
which will soon be linked to the Mankind Project Pro Meetup
account.</li>
<li>Men&rsquo;s group meetings are now every Tuesday (since March).  We had
been meeting twice a month since about August 2015.  The group has
slowly grown and now twice a month is not enough for every man to
do his work.</li>
<li>SOGO is still going, although the leadership is changing.  Menya
was not there today; Maha will soon be moving to Ireland; Michael
left for California last year.  Good job Pinakesh and Sho for
leading the group today!</li>
<li>Marble Track 3 has a grand total of nearly 9 minutes of video.  As
of this moment, the stage is spinning 4 units per frame (pretty
fast) and some characters are affected, but ghostable gluer is not
affected.</li>
<li>I work for JB primarily (Wednesdays and Thursdays in Kawasaki +
Akihabara) Solid Square early Wednesday mornings, from which Chika
has moved on; SCC Wednesday / Thursday afternoons, both for museum
and showspace; JB head office on Wednesday afternoon+evenings for
kids classes alongside Patrick, and adult lessons alongside Matt;
then GG lesson in Akihabara on Thursdays.</li>
<li>After GG on Thursdays I head home for Japanese lesson with Mel in
Chicago, who has free time after getting her son off to school on
their Thursday morning.</li>
<li>Secondarily working for ist with Tariq, with lessons on Monday
mornings.  We had a lot of students up to the end of the year last
year, but they pretty much bounced during the holidays.</li>
<li>Also working for ist on ConSwi, a new game we are developing
<em>slowly</em> but surely with <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot 3</a>.  I am
scheduled to meet Tariq this afternoon in 武蔵小杉 station.</li>
<li>Also working for Tess, with one lesson per week on Mondays around
noon.  Not sure if that will be continued after the next two
lessons coming up in April.</li>
<li>Also working on growing the men&rsquo;s group and hope to figure out a
way to bring enough value to businesses that I can make some money
with it.  For now it is all volunteer.</li>
<li>And volunteering a couple times a month on
<a href="https://www.7cups.com/">7 Cups</a>, etc.</li>
<li>I just received in the mail
<em>Sacred Circles</em> by Robin Deen Carnes and Sally Craig,
<em>The Gifts of Imperfection</em> by Brené Brown, and
<em>Planet on Purpose</em> by Brandon Peele.</li>
<li>Fred got his PhD! in December (I think).  He&rsquo;s teaching C++
courses.</li>
<li>Lin and I have our cat Jennie and live in our house near (ahem, 24
minutes walk from) 新百合ヶ丘 station.</li>
<li>I recently bought a Crayon Shinchan book, and a Doraemon book, but
they are kinda beyond my understanding, unless I go slowly.</li>
<li>I am still using my last ever Macbook Pro.</li>
<li>I got rid of my iPhone and now use a waterproof Android phone,
(which was waterproof before any iPhones were waterproof.)</li>
<li>running out of steam in this SOML.</li>
<li>Oh, I have been using <a href="https://complice.co/?r=pgej30cphu">Complice</a> to get stuff done.  It is
thanks to Complice that I remembered I need to write an SOML today.</li>
