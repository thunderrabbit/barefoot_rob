Today I was five minutes late to (teach) my lesson with Yuna; I excitedly told her about going to see 叶結（Kanauknot) today in 豊島園after having seen them in ぐりんぱ.
I was so excited that I explained &amp;ldquo;hh hh hh hh hh&amp;rdquo;, from The Castle of Dreams
I was so excited that for 30 minutes, this overshadowed my news about having done my first stand up comedy last night after being invited by Soness.</description>
