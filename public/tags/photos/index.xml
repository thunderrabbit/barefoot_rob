      <description>18:28 Thursday 03 May 2018 JST This could be made into Taxi Turnaround Timelapse, but I do not have an easy way to do that and do not want to spend any more time on it.</description>

      <description>11:58 Saturday 16 September 2017 JST I put this leaf down but before it could grow much past the pics shown here, it got cleaned up by the annual clearing done by city workers.
 
After the annual clear cut seemed to be complete, I found a spot that had not been cleared. It is still in the same park, but on a sidewalk, so maybe it will be clearcut by a different team.</description>
