                        <p>##12:30 Friday 02 January 2015 JST##</p>

<p>I got an email from Dr Steven Greer, and am taking the liberty of copying the bottom half:</p>

<pre><code>I am often asked about Disclosure and &quot;when&quot; it will happen: It
already has. A majority of people already believe we are not alone in
the cosmos and that we are being visited by advanced ET
civilizations. More than 14 [countries have opened their UFO files and
acknowledge this reality](https://www.educatinghumanity.com/2011/01/list-of-countries-that-have-disclosed.html). However the US- the crown jewel in the world
of super-secret technologies- has resisted Disclosure. We are not
surprised.

From 1992-2001, I personally briefed countless senior US Government
and other officials around the world: President Clinton's CIA
Director, members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Foreign
Relations Committee and other; Chairman of the House Government Reform
and Oversight Committee; The Director of Intelligence (J2) for the US
Joint Chiefs of Staff; the Director of the Pentagon's Defense
Intelligence Agency; members of European Royal families; former
Director of the British Ministry of Defense; Senior UN Officials
including the Secretary General of the UN; and so forth. In every
case, these very senior officials had no access to or knowledge of
projects and operations that we have proven to exist that deal with
UFOs and ETs.  As the CIA Director said: &quot;How can we Disclose that
which we have no access to?&quot;.

This means Disclosure - AND Contact- is in the hands of We The People.
The acknowledged leaders of government rarely if ever have access to
the deep-black Unacknowledged Special Access Projects (USAPs) dealing
with UFOs.  The public is led to believe, by an ever-lying media- that
the chain of command is intact and no such projects could exist. But
in truth, these USAPs are deeply hidden and compartmented and operate
completely illegally and unconstitutionally. They constitute a shadowy
international Fourth Branch of government that, frankly, does as it
pleases.

Further Disclosure will come two ways: First, more people must form
CE-5 Contact teams, make contact and document these events as
thoroughly as possible. When a critical mass of humans say to the ET's
that &quot;We are ready- come forward&quot;, they will. But it will not happen
by us being passive and waiting for others to do it. I assure you, the
ETs are waiting for a critical mass of us to send the signal that WE
are ready. They are waiting, ever so patiently.

Second: I am calling for a second large wave of Disclosure Witnesses:
Government, Defense, Intelligence and Corporate witnesses to UFO and
ET-related events, projects, research and technology.  These
whistle-blowers are freed from ANY AND ALL NATIONAL SECURITY OATHS AND
AGREEMENTS SINCE THE PROJECTS RELATED TO UFOS ARE ILLEGAL,
UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND THEREFORE THEY CANNOT USE THE LAW TO SILENCE
THEM.

This strategic policy was established in 1998 when we wrote to every
relevant branch of the US government stating that 1) the UFO related
operations were illegal and that 2) therefore we would come forward
with top secret witnesses who would henceforth be freed from the
constraints of any oaths signed or taken and that 3) we would do this
unless otherwise directed. ( In military protocol and parlance this is
an UNOD letter: Unless Otherwise Directed, we will proceed with this
plan of action and assume your silence equals agreement. We were never
officially informed otherwise, hence the launch of the global
Disclosure movement at the [National Press Club on May 9, 2001](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkswXVmG4xM).)

It is time for Wave Two of this process: I call on all of you to
identify friends, co-workers, family members, neighbors and so forth
who have worked in a DIRECT capacity and have first hand knowledge of
Government or Government - related (corporate) projects dealing with
UFOs and ETs and have them contact me at
[www.SiriusDisclosure.com](https://www.SiriusDisclosure.com). NOTE: we are not interested in hearsay,
second hand accounts and we require corroboration of the persons
claims, employment record, military service etc.

All of us need to do this together and create a second massive Wave of
Disclosure.  The President and the Congress are unlikely to act,
though it is fine to ask them to fulfill their duties. Why? They do
not have access to these USAPs; when they ask, they are lied to - or
threatened; and for the most part the subject is too controversial and
they know the media would have a field day ridiculing them.
Additionally, they lack the courage to lead on an issue the Disclosure
of which would terminate the petrodollar economic system and render
redundant all oil, gas, coal, utilities, nuclear power, solar power
and wind power investment and assets. This Disclosure, it is no
exaggeration to say, would constitute the greatest change in human
history.  And entrenched powers do not like change.

But remember: Large changes in history have NEVER come from the
centers of power. They have come from 'left field' , from outliers,
from the average person doing extraordinary things. Thats where We The
People come in.

In 2015, it is our turn.

Wishing all of you a happy, health and peaceful 2015!

In Universal Peace,


Steven M. Greer MD

<p><strong>12:45am Monday 13 May 2013</strong></p>

<p>Thanks to Rohini and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MoviesThatMatterTokyo">Movies That Matter Tokyo</a> crew for presenting <a href="https://siriusdisclosure.com/sirius-film-2/">Sirius</a> and Q&A; by <a href="https://jceti.org/?page_id=52">Greg Sullivan</a> of <a href="https://jceti.org/">jceti.org (Japan Center for Extraterrestrial Intelligence)</a></p>

<p>The movie presents four phenomena: many people have information about UFOs and are beginning to talk about it, free energy has been available for some time, there&rsquo;s a coverup of this information from the secret government, and a <a href="https://siriusdisclosure.com/evidence/atacama-humanoid/">small humanoid body was recovered in Acatama</a>, Chile.</p>

<p>In the Q&A; with Gregory, I asked if I can see in Tokyo or build for myself a free energy device.  He said the problem is not in the technology so much as our spiritual development; are we ready for free energy?</p>

<p>He leads CETI groups here in Japan; I&rsquo;d like to attend one!   Seems they just had one this weekend.</p>

<p>There are <a href="https://jceti.org/?page_id=91">several more screenings of Sirius</a>, and then in July another CETI event.  Nice!</p>

<p>To quote Jules, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo;; that&rsquo;s all there is to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>6:42am Thursday 9 May 2013</strong></p>

<p><em>I was in a small room, controlled by the government that was a bit like prison but not completely terrible conditions and it was time for alien disclosure but they were doing it in a very specific way. Some spider webs were in my room in the corner, and there was a pillow but nothing else. I was asked to lie face down with pillow ofer my head and to cover my ears as the aliens were revealed and each person could be shwon the aliens under supeision and not get freaked out. I was already not freaked out and planned to not cover my ears and couldn&rsquo;t lie face down because under pillow plus face down meant I couldn&rsquo;t breathe. I lay down face up with the pillow like a dome over my head and covered my ears fakely so I could hear but it looked like I was covering. I could hear the guy talking to the alien and he goes, &ldquo;face up?&rdquo; because the alien apparently ratted on me and he checked me and I was like yeah I can&rsquo;t breathe otherwise. He confirmed I coudln&rsquo;t see anything and allowed it.</em></p>

<p>_
Eventually I wa able to see the aliens, starting with seeing them out in the yard, and was a bt curious to see they loked like very large rats. Each prson outside was assigned an alient partner, and the humans were treated them ike pets, which the aliens were allowing s they knew we just needed to get it out of our system. I was determined to treat mine more respectfully so when I was assigned my alien I immediately asked if I could learn their language. I had a large book with alien symbols (looking something like Thai writing, but with a lot more space inside and between the letters). I was talking to my alien partner and asking questions about why it seemed to take so long and why go about disclosure in this way and the reply was this is how our government wanted it and how the people seemed ready for it. I explained that we each had the ability to think without the government so they could have asked us individually. He said they had, but we didn&rsquo;t hear them. Hmmmm._</p>

<p>A recent increase of ET activity worldwide seems to back up this assertion as well as what seems to be a corresponding increase in world government disclosure.</p>

<p>About a year ago I asked my friends at work, &ldquo;have you guys been seeing more reports of UFO sightings recently?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were like &ldquo;no,&rdquo; and I didn&rsquo;t bring it up again, but the thought remained in the back of my mind.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m ready!</p>

<p>A date of 2013 was given as the time for official disclosure and/or when extraterrestrials show up in an unambiguous way. In the interim there will be acclimation related releases of information. Importantly, the source revealed that the events leading up to official disclosure will involve more ethically oriented extraterrestrials, and they will not pose a military threat to the world.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t really understand the POV (author vs audience) of this article; it seems like it&rsquo;s a copy of a transcript or something.. but anyway, I like this kinda thing when dates are given.. Nice juicy dates that aren&rsquo;t too far away. I can wait until 2012. Er, I mean 2013.</p>

<p>Well, UFOs haven&rsquo;t arrived.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a snapshot of the site linked above, which seems to be slowly vanishing.</p>
