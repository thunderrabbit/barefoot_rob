      <description>18:02 Monday 25 March 2019 CST We went to Hopscotch, which had interactive exhibits and a ball pit. A ball pit!! Fred and I did a skit for Peter&amp;rsquo;s birthday, alternately falling down into the ball pit and looking for the one who had fallen.
Sandra batted balls back as we threw them to her. We swam along the bottom of the pool, which featured LED flooring. Lotta lotta fun.</description>

      <description>23:52 Saturday 08 October 2016 JST (names changed)
Hanako and Christy are over from Austin at Hanako&amp;rsquo;s parents, who happen to be our neighbors across the street. Mom came over at 9pm or so and was like, &amp;ldquo;Rob! come over!&amp;rdquo;
After hugging Hanako and Christy I talked to them and ignored Hanako&amp;rsquo;s siblings who were there with family because I was in new-people-overload (doesn&amp;rsquo;t take much, I guess) and selfishly wanted to talk to Americans.</description>
