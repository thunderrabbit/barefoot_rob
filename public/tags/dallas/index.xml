Sunday 11 February 1990
I just got back today from the 1990 Dallas Rally. On Friday I picked up Fred (my brother) from his house &amp; we met Rick E and Mike O at 6pm. We left in Rick&#39;s truck shortly afterward. We got there at about 10:something &amp; not many people were there. I got a mesage to call my mom (She&#39;s going to school at SMU, which is very close to the church).</description>
