      <description>23:26 Tuesday 26 June 2018 JST Tonight in Noborito station, I got off the train to try to figure out which train would be fastest to my station. A woman saw me barefoot and asked where I was going. She kindly looked up my station and confirmed my hunch that the next train was fastest to Shin Yurigaoka.
While riding on the train together, she asked me why I was barefoot, and then what I was doing in Japan.</description>
