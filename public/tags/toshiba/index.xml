      <description>01:56 Saturday 16 February 2019 JST Tomoko invited me to join 今さん and peeps for badminton. They play monthly at the Kawasaki something something Center, down 区役所どり from JR Kawasaki station.
I had so much fun that I did not notice a blood blister formed and burst while playing! I gave the raquet back and was like, &amp;ldquo;oh hang on; lemme wash that blood off of there&amp;rdquo; haha oops. I knew it was a bit sore, but did not noticed I had worn all the way through the skin.</description>

Before the lesson started, there was an announcement on PA system. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t really understand it,but they said &amp;ldquo;so don&amp;rsquo;t use the elevators or escalators.&amp;rdquo;
Chapters were with Mutsumi, Mari, Manami, and Rin.
Mutsumi explained that the van der graffe generator had been used a lot more than usual, so got a bit overheated, apparently setting off an alarm.</description>
