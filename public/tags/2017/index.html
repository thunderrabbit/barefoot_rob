<p>After working 3 hours (5 lessons) near Lazona, I&rsquo;m eating cold lunch
in Akihabara across the street from GG lesson. I have Lin&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s
heavy-as-hell suitcase.  (Now I know why gorillas cannot break them)</p>

<p>Lesson was great; everyone was there!  Yoko, Maki, and Atusko all
brought sweets!  Mayumi and Toshie both did homework!</p>

<p>We just made some pottery with an chill old man sensei.  I made a
mobius strip for Fred, an upside-down plate for me, a dice shaker and
two dice for my students.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Today was the first day to teach at a restaurant in Hiroo. 10
students, most of whom are beginners, but all were able to get
through some language, including, but not punctuated as, &ldquo;how many
in your party please follow me here you are here is the menu what
would you like to drink please let me know when you are ready to
order&rdquo; and &ldquo;this is sirloin sukiyaki may I help you prepare it we
recommend rare but how would you like it cooked this is our
original sauce dip the sirloin in egg wrap it around rice and
enjoy&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>Today was the second of five nights I substituted for Patrick at
AK.  At first, Eiko told me about how job and drew some pictures of
how plastic containers are made.  Then I reviewed the homework at
Mifuyu&rsquo;s request and suggested an article which she tried to print,
but wasn&rsquo;t able to, so I will print it and bring a copy next week.</p></li>

<li><p>Today is the first day back after the Gunma trip.  We have been
talking about it on FB; there were quite a few problems, but the
proprietor has been clear in how most of them were not her fault,
so it is hard for me to give further feedback.</p></li>

<li><p>I plan to do it, though; probably via email.</p></li>

<li><p>Goodness I almsot just fell asleep.  (I plan to leave that
misspelling of almost because it is indicative of my state.) I am
currently on the train headed to our station from Noborito, but I
was up at 5:10am or so and have not yet caught up on sleep after
the weekend.</p></li>

<li><p>I just realized that next week is the mikoshi thing but I do not
want to go.  I would rather join SOGO at the beach.  I need to RSVP
for SOGO, so if I forget to do that, I will do the mikoshi thing in
Kawasaki.  Gosh it would be a bummer to miss the beach.</p></li>

<li><p>Next station is my destination.</p></li>

<li><p>Today I missed my destination by two bus stops.  Then I went back
but missed it again, not knowing that on the way back the bus stop
names are not aligned across the street.</p></li>

<li><p>I have done 13 hours on Marble Track 3.  I plan to work on it
tomorrow.</p></li>

<li><p>I have not done enough work work recently (according to part of my
brain) so I plan to work some on paid website work this Friday and
Saturday.</p></li>

<li><p>Good to talk to Steve yesterday about IT stuff while he drove us
home (and dropped me off in Takasaki station)</p></li>

<li><p>Tomorrow night is the 1st or 3rd Tuesday of the month, so
therefore men&rsquo;s group.  Oh, I made a website
<a href="https://tokyo.mypowercircle.org/">https://tokyo.mypowercircle.org/</a> I think it should be mkptokyo or
mkpjapan or tokyo.mkpjapan maybe.</p></li>

<li><p>We have one cat (Jennie) and no other pets or kids or anything.</p></li>

<li><p>I have not drawn any art for a long time.  I still own
amazeaweek.net but have not touched it nor wiki.robnugen.com for
quite a while.</p></li>

<li><p>Dealing with the aftermath of our Gunma trip may take a while, but
I am optimistic for getting it done by next week.</p></li>

<li><p>I walked from Tokyo Tower to Shibuya station today (with teaching
at the restaurant as a two hour pit stop in the middle)</p></li>
