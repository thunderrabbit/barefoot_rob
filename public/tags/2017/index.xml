      <description>17:54 Thursday 14 December 2017 JST After working 3 hours (5 lessons) near Lazona, I&amp;rsquo;m eating cold lunch in Akihabara across the street from GG lesson. I have Lin&amp;rsquo;s sister&amp;rsquo;s heavy-as-hell suitcase. (Now I know why gorillas cannot break them)
19:41 Lesson was great; everyone was there! Yoko, Maki, and Atusko all brought sweets! Mayumi and Toshie both did homework!</description>
