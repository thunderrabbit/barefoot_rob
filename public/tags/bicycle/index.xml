      <description>06:34 Wednesday 08 May 2019 JST I rode TJ Bike to the bicycle parking lot today. This is the first time I have done so for work, given that we got our bicycle parking passes during Golden Week, and this is the first day that I have to work outside the house.
I usually allow 24 minutes to walk leisurely to the station. Riding TJ Bike &amp;ldquo;leisurely&amp;rdquo; down a big hill, I arrived at the bicycle parking area in 8 minutes.</description>

      <description>15:54 Monday 08 June 2015 JST The bicycle parking area was full, so I parked in non-space out of the way of any pedestrians.
I went back three hours later and the bike wasn&amp;rsquo;t there.
Aw man.
I walked around the place looking for it, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t find it very quickly. Dang. So I called the number listed on their &amp;ldquo;got problems?&amp;rdquo; sign. The woman was like, &amp;ldquo;okay so which parking area are you talking about?</description>

      <description>12:24 Thursday 04 June 2015 JST It rolls and sounds like it&amp;rsquo;s new.
The little generator thing was set to (slowly) carve a groove in the wheel, so I mentioned that to the guy. (I had explained it to him before; I had to buy new tires because it had destroyed the old ones with its patient wear.) He tried to move the light up so that it rode flat against the tire, but could not.</description>
