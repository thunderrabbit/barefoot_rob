      <description>1998 SWUUSI Review by Maia Cudhea
  i can&#39;t believe no one reviewed swuusi. so i&#39;ll do it belatedly. okay, here&#39;s what i remember several months later. i got to camp really late saturday night, and the rest of staff was way already there. my hair was all done up from my sister&#39;s wedding (why i was late) and i was so tired. so we had this quick meeting and said we&#39;d do everything else tomorrow and i went to sleep on a table.</description>
