      <description>8:37 Sunday 14 April 2019 JST After Yomiuriland yesterday, the skin on the bottom of my left foot split a bit. This morning I superglued it shut and put some tape over it. Seems to be okay.
10:38 Sunday 14 April 2019 JST I put on socks and shoes to take off my shoes as I went into Lantz&amp;rsquo;s office. I left my shoes on during my trip back home as the split is painful.</description>

      <description>21:45 Sunday 09 July 2017 JST OMG my Japanese teacher has recently been told she has to have something removed from her throat!
Thank you for your kindness. I think I&#39;ll be OK. But to be honest they&#39;ll cut my throat and take something off (sorry!) so I have no idea how long is going to be until I can speak as a language tutor. Hope it&#39;s soon though. また　たくさん　話しましょうね！  Yikes stripes!</description>
