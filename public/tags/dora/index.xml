      <description>16:03 Monday 22 October 2018 JST I chatted with Dora for 1.75 hours on the phone. She had some amazing insights on my presentation for MKP stuff. Plus a course she has enjoyed taking, designed to help people start their business projects.
While talking, I walked from Nishi-Azabu to the other end of Yoyogi Park before realizing I had intended to turn right before Yoyogi Park, or actually maybe even turn at Omotesando.</description>
