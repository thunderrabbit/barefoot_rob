      <description>12:40 Sunday 25 October 2015 JST Why do I get so grouchy when I have to repeat myself. I see the words &amp;ldquo;have to&amp;rdquo; there, but I mean when I say something and Lin didn&amp;rsquo;t hear me/ didn&amp;rsquo;t understand me/ wasn&amp;rsquo;t listening, and she goes, &amp;ldquo;what?&amp;rdquo; (or says nothing at all.)
Hideo at CPC repeats himself all the time because he&amp;rsquo;s often in charge of 10 or 15 people, all of whom are kinda doing their own thing, or possibly on different schedules.</description>

      <description>11:14 Sunday 14 June 2015 JST I&amp;rsquo;ve been enjoying Japanese class in Akihabara and Lin is of the opinion that everyone there is trying to find someone to hook up with, but that&amp;rsquo;s simply not true.
But we do hang out and chat and there is cute りさ there, but no hanky panky is happening or planned.
This morning I was like I&amp;rsquo;m going to meet Tariq, and then later, oh it&amp;rsquo;s for his daughters&amp;rsquo; karate thing and Lin&amp;rsquo;s all mad that I didn&amp;rsquo;t tell her before.</description>

      <description>27 May 1999
The machine I wanted to convert to linux, apparently, for no apparent reason, has broken.
It was so cute - Win 95 with almost no drivers, almost nothing on the disk.. I copied to floppies a couple of files that I wanted to keep, and I was ready to install linux.
Taking an inventory of the machine, I booted it a couple times to see what chipset was on the video card.</description>
