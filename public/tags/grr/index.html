<p>Why do I get so grouchy when I have to repeat myself.  I see the words
&ldquo;have to&rdquo; there, but I mean when I say something and Lin didn&rsquo;t hear
me/ didn&rsquo;t understand me/ wasn&rsquo;t listening, and she goes, &ldquo;what?&rdquo; (or
says nothing at all.)</p>

<p>Hideo at CPC repeats himself all the time because he&rsquo;s often in charge
of 10 or 15 people, all of whom are kinda doing their own thing, or
possibly on different schedules.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m always so impressed when I see people repeat themselves for people
who weren&rsquo;t listening.  I fucking hate it.  What&rsquo;s triggering that
hate/anger?</p>

<p>Back in Houston, I was looking at this issue, and had a spontaneous
memory which I&rsquo;m calling a memory from a past life because, well, I
remember telling my army buddy he was loading a weapon incorrectly,
and after he didn&rsquo;t listen, he was killed by it when he fired it.</p>

<p>I was never in the army so it&rsquo;s an interesting memory for me.</p>

<p>But there&rsquo;s still more triggering this thing because crying about my
army buddy&rsquo;s death doesn&rsquo;t seem to have resolved everything.</p>

<p>Speaking English in Japan gives me ample opportunity to look at this
issue.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been enjoying Japanese class in Akihabara and Lin is of the
opinion that everyone there is trying to find someone to hook up with,
but that&rsquo;s simply not true.</p>

<p>But we do hang out and chat and there is cute りさ there, but no hanky
panky is happening or planned.</p>

<p>This morning I was like I&rsquo;m going to meet Tariq, and then later, oh
it&rsquo;s for his daughters&rsquo; karate thing and Lin&rsquo;s all mad that I didn&rsquo;t
tell her before.  I don&rsquo;t know why I didn&rsquo;t tell her, but a long ass
conversation about it won&rsquo;t make it any better.</p>

<p><p>The machine I wanted to convert to linux, apparently, for no apparent reason, has broken.</p>

<p><p>It was so cute - Win 95 with almost no drivers, almost nothing on the disk..  I copied to floppies a couple of files that I wanted to keep, and I was ready to install linux.</p>

<p><p>Taking an inventory of the machine, I booted it a couple times to see what chipset was on the video card.  It didn&rsquo;t say how much memory was on the card, so I powered down and removed the card.  I couldn&rsquo;t really tell, so I put the card back in.</p>

<p><p>Turned it on and got angry BEEEEEPs back.  No signal to the monitor.  What???  All I did was remove and replace the video card.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ve tried another video card and it did not work.  I have no idea what I may have done.  Sigh.  It was a PII 233.  Do I need a new motherboard?  New CPU?  What could I have done?</p>
