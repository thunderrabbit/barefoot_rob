      <description>16:01 Monday 19 February 2018 JST Special thanks to C for letting me work here instead of heading back home and back out for co-gender meeting. Cats seem (un)interested in helping me work, and now there is a presentation traipsing through, but I got 2 pomodoros finished on ConSwi.</description>

      <description>22:19 Monday 06 April 2015 JST I apparently left the sliding glass door unlocked yesterday; Ted opened it and got outside. He hasn&amp;rsquo;t come back, though we&amp;rsquo;ve seen him on the balcony opposite ours.
Jennie and Ted usually sleep in the bed with Lin, and sometimes with me, but last night Jennie slept in the bed reserved for cats.
And today when ママ came home, Jennie bolted out the door, looking for Ted, I&amp;rsquo;m sure!</description>

      <description>13:57 Monday 30 March 2015 JST When we got our cats last year, I replaced the thin, easily-ripped screen on the sliding door with a somewhat sturdier stainless steel screen.
After the cats ascended the screen a few times, leaving claw-sized sags, they realized the could just ram through the bottom corner, so they did.
I deliberated for a long time how to replace it with something even sturdier, and have not yet found a solution.</description>

Jennie likes to sleep wherever Ted has chosen to sleep.</description>

Ted&amp;rsquo;s head was more upside down before I started taking the photos.
 
Jenny looks like she&amp;rsquo;s still asleep:</description>

Lin is trying to woo the little cat who has taken a liking to our balcony. She goes, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m afraid I might start to like him.&amp;rdquo;
I go, &amp;ldquo;too late!&amp;rdquo;
I won&amp;rsquo;t be surprised if we have three cats soon enough, but no more!</description>

I know the nimble cats can jump over it, but hopefully the mean heavy cats will not. There&amp;rsquo;s a small brown cat who likes to chill on our balcony. We&amp;rsquo;re not ready for three (3) cats, so haven&amp;rsquo;t let him inside. But we have been feeding him because&amp;hellip; cat!
However, there&amp;rsquo;s a big bully cat who wants the same balcony space so I blocked the small gap where they usually enter the balcony.</description>
