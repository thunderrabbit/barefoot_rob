<p>Yeah what can I say besides great except it wasn&rsquo;t completely what I
had hoped since I was looking for a bit more facilitation training.
It will come though.  This training was about the NWTA; next training
is more focused on facilitation.</p>

<p>I told the group I might not be back next year; I will more carefully
look at options for where would make the most sense for men from Japan
to do a training.</p>

<p>Today was the fifth of five virtual I-groups designed to give
leadership practice to men in the group.  Just five men in the group,
one night each gives a sense of what it&rsquo;s like and lets men see other
men leading the calls.</p>

<p>So I will be the leader leader of the next set of calls, planned for 6
calls starting in October.</p>

<p>I was invited to continue for another 6 weeks of online circle (not
really a circle, but) facilitation practice starting 20 July.  I feel
fear about leading my own groups, but I will head that direction anyway.</p>

<p>Back in high school I determed that emotions must be important.</p>

<p>Why do they stay available long after the cause is finished?  Not like
memories or scars which fade with time, but remain somehow somewhere,
available until we experience them.  I experienced this long after my
granddad died and smelled something that reminded me of him.  boom
crying crying tears even though I only vaguely remembered the thing he
gave me.</p>

<p>Like our bodies aparently refresh cells every 6 months or something to
keep them viable&hellip; is there some mechanism by which emotions are kept
viable?</p>

<p>Recently, I noticed another thing.  They (who?) say that we end up
marrying someone who was like our parents, possibly because we are
attracted to the same wounds we had as kids.  But why?</p>

<p>Maybe (and this is my theory) maybe we are driven toward people who
emotionally wound us in the same way so that we are given more chances
to heal the wounds.</p>

<p>If I need to deal with the sadness due to absent parents, I marry
someone who is emotionally unavailable..  so I have a chance to deal
with that sadness!  Isn&rsquo;t that convenient?  It makes me think
something like &ldquo;emotions are self healing&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;s not
that&hellip; &ldquo;emotions drive us toward behavior that triggers the emotions&rdquo;</p>

<p>more to come ?</p>

<p>Tokyo Men&rsquo;s Circle had 6 participants including a new man last night.
He said he plans to attend the co-gender group next week.  We talked
about ways to serve the community even more, possibly offering
team-building workshops to businesses.</p>

<p>Still working on a name for the circle which I had been calling the
co-gender group.  Anyway, our second meeting was great last night.
Five members in attendance, and we practiced exercises from Week 2 of
A Circle of Men.  After the circle, some members expressed interest in
exploring this further, so I guided them through clearing charges,
with the remaining member holding space.</p>

<p>In my integration group, B asked if &ldquo;anyone would like to volunteer
for&hellip;&rdquo; and my hand immediately shot up, not knowing what I was
volunteering for.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay, Rob&rdquo; continued B, &ldquo;you get to be our Guardian Angel&rdquo; and, based
on your experience, offer answers to life questions that we pose.</p>
