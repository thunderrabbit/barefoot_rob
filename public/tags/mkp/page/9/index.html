<p>I chatted with Chuck (from men&rsquo;s group, not ASL instructor) on Skype
yesterday.  We may make it a weekly thing.  I&rsquo;d benefit from having
someone to bitch to and hold me accountable for shit I need to do.</p>

<p>We met AJ selling T-shirts at the beach.  Listening to him, I was
inspired to tell him about MKP.  He was like, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m already there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wow; nice!</p>

<p>Tonight was the second open I-group in Tokyo, and it went quite well.
I posed the question &ldquo;what would you change in your personal life if
you could change anything?&rdquo; and looked in detail at some of the
answers. I now have a nice plan for how to be a better husband/partner
with Lin.</p>

<p>During the first half of his lesson, Sarupapa asked me about MKP and I
told him as much as I was able with my broken Japanese and English
hybrid sentences.  He said it seemed interesting; I wonder if he&rsquo;d
eventually be interested in attending I-group with us.</p>

<p>Sarumama came after that and we went over her homework.  She&rsquo;s really
improving and would be a great inspiration if I wasn&rsquo;t so frickin&rsquo;
lazy to study Japanese!  blarg.</p>

<p>Then we went to Thai dinner in a nice small (8 bar seats) downstairs
Thai restaurant near Yoyogi Station.  I felt all なつかしい to be
sortof in Thai-mode of greetings with respectful prayer hands which
I&rsquo;ve continued to do since being there for just 3 months &hellip; five
years ago!</p>

<p>Goodness I loved that life.</p>

<p>Today on the way to Paola and Jon&rsquo;s I saw an apparently English
speaking man on the train.  We made eye contact and smiled, and I
thought, &ldquo;hmm maybe he&rsquo;d be interested in MKP.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I sat for a few stations before deciding fuckit, and I went back to
speak to him.  He seemed interested enough to swap email addresses,
and I emailed him this afternoon.</p>

<p>We met at Takeshi&rsquo;s tonight, our first meeting in over a year, I
imagine.  The last meeting I called in an emergency being all
confuzzled about junk, though the issues mostly resolved by the time
the meeting happened.</p>

<p>This meeting was called from a much more sane and golden space: I&rsquo;m
going to staff NWTA in October, and I&rsquo;d like to help our I-group grow.</p>

<p>to do</p>

<ol>
<li>look for mkp men in Tokyo</li>
<li>Look for lists of email lists</li>
<li>ask to be on leadership email lists</li>
<li>Announce myself as point person for Tokyo integration group</li>
<li>Next meeting 23 October</li>
</ol>

<p>contact me for deets.  tokyo-mkp at this domain</p>

<p>I changed my life in 1997 by attending a weekend men&rsquo;s retreat organized by <a href="https://mkp.org/">https://mkp.org/</a> My ability to understand myself and my emotions / motivations grew exponentially from there. I&rsquo;m by no means an expert, but I&rsquo;m much better able to listen to others, and express myself&hellip;. though not in this post, apparently!!</p>

<p>Anyway, I have missed the energy of this organization since moving to Japan, and recently decided to get involved again. I&rsquo;m heading to Perth in October(*) with the hopes that it will rekindle the fire of authentic ROB within me!</p>

<p>(*) 95% confirmed. :-)</p>

<p><p>
This weekend changed my life.
<p>
When I first heard about <a href=https://www.mkp.org>New Warrior Training</a> I was quite not interested.  Some kind of initiation into manhood&hellip; and I wanted nothing to do with it.  That was two years ago.
<p>
The reason I wanted nothing to do with it:  I was afraid of men.<br>
I certainly didn&rsquo;t want to become a man.  And I doubly certaintly didn&rsquo;t want to be associated with men and known as a man.  No way.
<p>
Almost a year ago I attended a New Warrior graduation ceremony.
<br>
The men I saw on stage were not too scary.  They were acting as real humans, with feelings, and expressing their emotions.<br>
Hmmmm.<br>
Maybe it&rsquo;s not so bad after all.
<p>
After I attended a second graduation, I knew I wanted to do it.
<p>
I called my dad and asked if he had ever heard of it.
<p>
&ldquo;Yep!  And I&rsquo;ve signed up for the weekend in August!&rdquo;
<p>
Wow.  I was actually kinda jealous, but really happy for him.
<p>
My weekend was this weekend. It really changed my life, but as I write this, I recognize I don&rsquo;t wish to share all the details with the world (even though this site gets so few hits per day&hellip;)<p>
But I learned a few things:<p>
<ul>
<li>I can trust men and survive.</li>
<li>Without realizing it, I have grown to be a man.</li>
<li>There is still a lot more to learn.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
