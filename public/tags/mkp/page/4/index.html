<p>I&rsquo;m excited when I think about my vision, and I&rsquo;m scared what I think
about implementing it.</p>

<p>I have been leading Tokyo men&rsquo;s Circle for three years, And my vision
is to create more circles that are empowered to continue doing their
own emotional growth work.</p>

<p>A man has two lives.  The second one begins when he realized he only
has one life.</p>

<p>My second life has begun.  I am feeling the fire in my gut, mixed with
the fear of rejection and failure.  But as I have learned through
experience, if I follow my fear I will be headed in the right
direction in life.</p>

<p>For me these fears result in me dying alone.  There is a process
called What&rsquo;s at Risk which I learned from Mankind Project.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at risk if I do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;People might not like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at Risk if they do not like it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will not like me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at Risk if they do not like you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will leave me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at Risk if they leave you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will eventually die alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once we get to the bottom, we start over with the other option as a
starting point.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at risk if I don&rsquo;t do it?&rdquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will lead a pointless life&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at Risk if you lead a pointless life?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will have no enthusiasm&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at Risk if you have no enthusiasm?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will have no connection to friends&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at Risk if you have no connection to friends?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will die alone&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have been through this chain of broken logic countless times.  In my
case, when I follow the what&rsquo;s at risk line of questions, I always end up dying alone.</p>

<p>I believe the point of the exercise is to point out the logical
fallacy.  Somewehre there is a mis-step in logic.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s try it again:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at Risk if you do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;People might not like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at Risk if people might not like it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will adjust it and try again&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aha!  That was quick.  Because my excitement is merged in with the
fear, coming from a core <em>knowing</em> that this is the right way to go.
Or at least the right ballpark or sport.</p>

<p>That knowing is there that I will not just give up.  I will keep
coming back at it from different angles until I get it right.  I just
have to hope I won&rsquo;t be like a mosquito trying to go through a screen
window.</p>

<hr />

<p>So what is the vision?  The vision is to make Emotional Intelligence
as important as that other kind of Intelligence, just plain old
intellect.  The vision is that I can stand listening to someone yell
at me when I fuck up my visa.  &ldquo;You have to leave Japan today!&rdquo; big
man was yelling at me, and I was aware of the fear inside my body, but
did not get pushed around by it.  I could feel it swirling.  &ldquo;I had
fucked up.  My life was ruined.&rdquo;  But I also know fear is an emotion.
It is energy in motion.  Fear is that feeling that comes up when I do
not have enough information to make a decision about the future.  I
want to stay in the country; I am listening to a man yell at me,
saying that I cannot.  I stood there calmly listening.</p>

<p>He paused for second.  &ldquo;Do you understand what I am saying?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I assured him I did and reiterated the sailent points.  He agreed that
I got it, but the points pointed to one main point.  I had to leave.</p>

<p>So I punted.  &ldquo;I am planning to get married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had popped the question to Lin a month or so prior to this event.
During that month she kept asking if I had gotten my visa sorted.  &ldquo;I
still have time; the postcard says to do it by July 18th&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turns out, that date didn&rsquo;t matter.  It was the date actually <em>in my
passport</em> that mattered.</p>

<p>To be Continued &hellip;.</p>

<p>The Mission Workshop was a great success last night, with 8 men in
attendance.  We tapped in to our Little Boys Deepest needs, then
visualized an ideal world with the needs met.  Where everyone has had
this deepest need met.  What kind of world is it?  _________,
___________, ____________.</p>

<p>Then we went back to this ideal world and found ourselves living
within it.  Not only living, but interacting and behaving in new ways
in this ideal world.  We noticed we are actually creating the ideal
world with our actions.  Connected with our little boy, bringing
action into create the perfect world where everyone&rsquo;s need is met.
What actions did you find yourself performing?  _________, _________,
_________.</p>

<p>You have found your Vision of an ideal world and your Action in this
world.  With this, we created Mission Statements.</p>

<p>I create a world of __________, __________, and ___________ by
_________, _____________, and ______________.</p>

<p>For me, <em>I create a world of love, safety, and connection by teaching,
inviting, and sharing.</em></p>

<p>Using the visualization and format above, feel free to create a
mission statement in this format and bring it to the next meeting.
We will be using them more often in the circle.</p>

<p>Four men in the circle tonight, including two relatively newcomers.  I
experienced beautiful facilitation to help me get the courage to
implement my new idea.</p>

<p>I have just sent this message to my friend H.</p>

<pre><code>I am thinking about doing a 6 month set of weekly circles on
Friday nights.  Could I do them at your place?  Would you be able
to attend, assuming you'd be interested in the content?

My idea is to do something very close to the men's circle, but
with a focus of finding one's mission/purpose in life.  Once the
circle is formed relatively well, we would do an exercise for each
person to find their life mission, and then focus on implementing
that life mission for the remaining 3 months or so.  The timing I
have in mind is just a rough guess, but wondering if you would be
interested in participating?

<p>Tonight I chose to work on my anger related to things not going my
way.</p>

<p>Anger: why is this person standing blocking the escalator keeping
people from going up?</p>

<p>Anger: why would R-san not trust a professional wine taster that he
knows how to taste wine without getting drunk?</p>

<p>Anger: why would A-san suggest popcorn style for people to speak up
instead of just asking each person?</p>

<p>Following the anger back, I came upon a scene in the game room back in
the house where we lived until I was 7 years old.  We had some
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slot_car_racing">slot cars</a> that my dad
showed me how to put oil on the cars to make them go faster.  I put
oil on them and basically clogged up the motors so they hardly ran at
all.</p>

<p>My dad was so mad at me.  He&rsquo;s the one who fuckin&rsquo; showed me how to
add oil to them!!</p>

<p>In my mind, I went back to the scene to just sit with myself-at-age-7
and be with him.  Daddy was at work; mommy was at work.  He was alone
playing with the cars, likely trying to show his brother or the
neighbor kids how to make the cars faster.</p>

<p>In my mind, I went to bat for 7-year-old-me when my dad came home.
&ldquo;Well, you showed him how to do it, and he did it.  It&rsquo;s gonna be
okay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I allowed 7-year-old-me to come live in my heart and everything be
okay.</p>

<p>I withdrew the projection that A-san doing popcorn style is
imperfect.  It&rsquo;s going to be okay.</p>

<p>I withdrew my projection that R-san should assume pro-san knows what
he is doing.  Maybe he doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>I withdrew the projection that escalator-san was doing anything wrong
by standing there.  Maybe they are keeping back a few seconds so I
won&rsquo;t get hit by a car later.</p>

<p>I did not keep careful track, but I believe we had 15 men in Tokyo
men&rsquo;s circle (Integration group) last night.  According to <em>A Circle
of Men</em> we should think about splitting the group if the group is
larger than about 12 men.</p>

<p>I wonder about splitting the circle into two groups on the same
evenings, or possible begin a circle on another evening of the week.</p>

<p>So thankful for my group tonight who were able to help me look at my
income problem, pick me up out of the proverbial quicksand, and open
me up to no limits for my business plan.</p>

<p>Not that I actually knew I was in proverbial quicksand, nor that I had
unconsciously put limits on my possible business.  Great to have great
feedback from them.</p>

<p>Today is the first day I will be able to attend the entire integration
group since seven weeks ago when I started the Court of Support
meetings after LT1 in Portland.</p>
