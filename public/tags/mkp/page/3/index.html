<p>The GoFundme text is not finished yet, but I plan to finish it up
tonight or tomorrow.</p>

<p>It took a while to get this version complete, including breaking a pen
and crying my eyes out with Mark at the Jonathan&rsquo;s near <ruby><rb>向ヶ
丘遊園駅</rb><rt><ruby><rb>むこうがおかゆうえんえき
</rb><rt>mukogaokayuen station</rt></ruby></rt></ruby>.</p>

<p>Between working for TY and AB, I got this version complete in one
take, after about 30 takes over a period of a week or so.</p>

<p>One of the AB cronjobs has been throwing errors, but the job is still
running.</p>

<p>I am in the middle of refactoring the code to use Dependency
Injection; I don&rsquo;t know how I broke something, but I cannot really go
back to a previous version.  Rather, I don&rsquo;t know what version to go
back to, and my local dev environment cannot recreate the error.</p>

<p>Annoyingly, my local dev environment cannot even access Ye Olde
Interneffe so I cannot easily revert local files to a previous state
anyway.</p>

<pre><code>both frontend and backend use Localizer::getInstance in these
classes. Inject it instead of reference Singleton

./Data/Unit.php
./DeviceHandler.php
./SiteHandler.php
./Template.php
./Translator.php
</code></pre>

<p>I am in the middle of doing <code>\Data\Unit</code>.  Perhaps once I finish that,
I can push, deploy, and pray.</p>

<p>There are 19 more places to change instantiations of <code>\Data\Unit</code>,
including in <code>\Factory\UnitFactory</code>.</p>

<p>I am curious if I misread or misunderstood the MLAPHP book which said
we are making small incremental changes.  This little change seems to
have blown up a bit, due to classes which instantiate <code>\Data\Unit</code> and
should eventually have its dependencies injected into them as well.</p>

<p>Men,</p>

<p>Back when I joined Mankind Project in 1997, the New Warrior Training
Adventure was the only way to get started in Mankind Project.</p>

<p>Attending the weekend was a life changing experience for me.  It was
on that weekend that I realized I was a man.  It was during that
weekend that I began to get over my fear of men.</p>

<p>Over the years, as an organization, Mankind Project has begun
encouraging new men to sit in Open Circles (like the one we have in
Tokyo) before attending the New Warrior Training Adventure (NWTA).</p>

<p>I believe the NWTA is still a life changing experience, even after you
have been sitting in an open circle.  Over the course of the weekend,
there is more time to really get into the work than we can in 2 hours.</p>

<p>Anyway, I very rarely do anything like sales pitches in the meetings.
I assume you cannot go.  I assume you are not interested.  I assume
all sorts of things that stop me from inviting you.</p>

<p>I hereby invite you to challenge me on Tuesday if I do not bring up
the NWTA coming up in Hawaii, March 29th - 31st.</p>

<p>I also hereby invite you to join me in Hawaii for the NWTA, March
29th - 31st.  I will be on staff, and look forward to seeing you there.</p>

<p>Is this the time for you? I don&rsquo;t know.  But if you are interested,
start here: <a href="https://nwta.mkp.org/">https://nwta.mkp.org/</a></p>

<p>I was the only other man to show up for D&rsquo;s men&rsquo;s circle tonight.  We
walked to a park near his house which has a wooded area.</p>

<p>Away from the busy-ness of the park, we settled in for a meditation
and then got into my work.  Wondering how to balance my projects,
where to focus my energy, how to do the right thing?</p>

<p>The feelings of fear and sadness took me back to a time with my dad.
He told me we would make a cool project together, basically a bigger
better pinball machine with sounds and lights and ramps going
everywhere.  Holy shit that sounds awesome!  I looked forward to that
project for years until I realized it was never going to happen.</p>

<p>That feeling just sat and festered and rot away my connection to
creativity until it is just a smidgen of what it used to be or could
have been.  Why the fuck did he lie to me?</p>

<p>&ldquo;why did you lie to me???  You told me not to like, but then you lied!
It&rsquo;s not fair!&rdquo;  crying crying crying in the woods.  Gasping gut
wrenching sobbing cry with 100 tears for all the years it has been
rotting inside me.</p>

<p>Some security guard came up and told us to get out of the woods, but he gave us
space when he saw me crying.</p>

<p>Got all the tears out and then turned it into blessings.</p>

<p>I forgive myself for believing my dad could do anything.
I forgive myself for not knowing what to do at 7 years old.</p>

<p>I thank spirit for the creative connection which is fully available to
me.</p>

<p>I have my dad&rsquo;s blessing to go forward with my creative endeavors.</p>

<p>Exciting MKP Tokyo news!</p>

<p>I sent this to my online Integration Group.</p>

<pre><code>I just got confirmation: I will be co-facilitating a 3-week online
MKP introduction called The Men's Work https://mkpusa.org/themenswork/
with Paul Newell, who is currently co-facilitating it in the US.

On Fridays, 7pm - 8:30pm (Japan time), November 3rd, 10th, and
17th, we will do this online training for men in Tokyo.

Once we run this 3 week series of meetings a couple of times, I
will create a new men's circle in Gotanda (Tokyo) on Fridays for
men who are interested.  Once those Gotanda men have sat in circle
for a few months, I will do a Mission Statement workshop with
them.

Once we have two circles humming along, I plan to invite an MKP
man from overseas to Japan to teach facilitation skills to men who
are interested.  My want is to get more and more circles started
in Japan so we can create a groundswell movement to have enough
energy to do NWTAs here in Japan.

<p>BH set up a Slack space for MKP Japan where we can discuss creating
the organization and setting up some trainings.</p>

<p>I got a multi-month fix done for AB; now users can use the same filter
on their custom list page as they can on the main list.  I don&rsquo;t
recall why it was set up this weird way before, but it is better now.
Oh, and they now have a recycle bin function on the custom list page
so it is easier to hide and restore things from their list.  (It used
to take 3 clicks to hide an item (and they could not be restored) but
now it takes 1 click to hide an item, 1 click to reveal hidden items,
and 1 click to restore each hidden item)</p>

<p>And I glued a single stick in place for Marble Track 3.  It is the
first stick that will be used as a support for the Outer Spiral.</p>
