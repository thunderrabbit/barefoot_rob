<p>The co-gender circle has decided to move the meetings to Mondays so we
can meet every week!</p>

<p>Soon the men&rsquo;s circle will meet every week as well, I am fairly certain.</p>

<p>Great integration group council meeting today.  I got some great ideas
for how to help invite new men into the work.  I mean the same type of
work in
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/10/the-work-review-folsom-prison">The Work</a>.</p>

<p>Blessings to all the men who make this work possible.</p>

<p>Great online Integration Group today.  Just six men in the call (we
recently have had as many as 11 or 12).  I was asked to facilitate
twice (joy for me) and both men said it was very helpful.  yay!</p>

<p>Headed to work now, slightly later than my arrive-early target, but
still early enough to be on time.  The weather is clear blue chilly
with snow melting in the sun and frozen solid in the shade.</p>

<p>We had a great meeting last night with seven men in the circle.</p>

<p>This month has 5 Tuesdays, so normally we would skip the 5th Tuesday.</p>

<p>This month we will have a meeting on the 5th Tuesday.</p>

<p>Soon I imagine we will meet every Tuesday and have the co-gender group
meet on a different day.</p>

group in the future.</p>

<p>Funny talking to Scotty on Marco Polo; he kept not being able to hear
me until I was like &ldquo;okay bye&rdquo; or &ldquo;okay I hope you could hear it that
time!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I am headed to Kawasaki to support the guides in the English versions
of their work.  Then GG lesson in Akihabara.</p>

<p>Quick online I-group today; everyone checked out so it was just me and
my coach near North Zulch, Texas.</p>

<p>We are building a peer support group of committed men who help each

<p>We build conflict resolution skills, create a personal mission
statement, and create great friendships.</p>

<p>Virtual Group was good today.  I got some feedback on how to better
handle a man joining in the middle of the call.  Essentially, he knew
he was late, and he knew why he was late; I did not have to ask him
why he was late, but just if he knew why he was late.</p>

<p>Great I-group today; I had chills from within when I got to yell at my
dad from when I was 7 years old.</p>

<p>He said &ldquo;if there were 100 people from your class all in a line, you
would be the smartest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He meant it well, but it&rsquo;s like hey fuck you don&rsquo;t put that on a 7
year old!  what is he going to do with that info?</p>

<p>just love me and say you&rsquo;re proud of me etc.  so I had a good dad give
me the messages I wanted to hear.  such a great relief</p>
