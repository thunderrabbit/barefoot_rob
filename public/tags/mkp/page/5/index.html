<p>I forgot the monthly Integration Group Coordinator call is at 9am
Japan time now that the time has sprung forward an hour.  I was a few
minutes late to the call, but all was good.  Oh that reminds me, I
gotta correct the time in my reminder messages for next month.</p>

<p>We talked about suicide prevention, and ways to raise awareness of
this issue and how people can get support.</p>

<p>Nice synchronicity brought two old friends together on the train just
in time for one to invite the other two men&rsquo;s group last night, the
first Tuesday of the month, when new men are welcome to join.</p>

<p>Six men in the circle last night.  Good strong container in which we
did a lot of good work.</p>

<ol>
<li>I started a Meetup group
<a href="https://www.meetup.com/ManKind-Project-Tokyo/">ManKind Project Tokyo</a>
which will soon be linked to the Mankind Project Pro Meetup
account.</li>
<li>Men&rsquo;s group meetings are now every Tuesday (since March).  We had
been meeting twice a month since about August 2015.  The group has
slowly grown and now twice a month is not enough for every man to
do his work.</li>
<li>SOGO is still going, although the leadership is changing.  Menya
was not there today; Maha will soon be moving to Ireland; Michael
left for California last year.  Good job Pinakesh and Sho for
leading the group today!</li>
<li>Marble Track 3 has a grand total of nearly 9 minutes of video.  As
of this moment, the stage is spinning 4 units per frame (pretty
fast) and some characters are affected, but ghostable gluer is not
affected.</li>
<li>I work for JB primarily (Wednesdays and Thursdays in Kawasaki +
Akihabara) Solid Square early Wednesday mornings, from which Chika
has moved on; SCC Wednesday / Thursday afternoons, both for museum
and showspace; JB head office on Wednesday afternoon+evenings for
kids classes alongside Patrick, and adult lessons alongside Matt;
then GG lesson in Akihabara on Thursdays.</li>
<li>After GG on Thursdays I head home for Japanese lesson with Mel in
Chicago, who has free time after getting her son off to school on
their Thursday morning.</li>
<li>Secondarily working for ist with Tariq, with lessons on Monday
mornings.  We had a lot of students up to the end of the year last
year, but they pretty much bounced during the holidays.</li>
<li>Also working for ist on ConSwi, a new game we are developing
<em>slowly</em> but surely with <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot 3</a>.  I am
scheduled to meet Tariq this afternoon in 武蔵小杉 station.</li>
<li>Also working for Tess, with one lesson per week on Mondays around
noon.  Not sure if that will be continued after the next two
lessons coming up in April.</li>
<li>Also working on growing the men&rsquo;s group and hope to figure out a
way to bring enough value to businesses that I can make some money
with it.  For now it is all volunteer.</li>
<li>And volunteering a couple times a month on
<a href="https://www.7cups.com/">7 Cups</a>, etc.</li>
<li>I just received in the mail
<em>Sacred Circles</em> by Robin Deen Carnes and Sally Craig,
<em>The Gifts of Imperfection</em> by Brené Brown, and
<em>Planet on Purpose</em> by Brandon Peele.</li>
<li>Fred got his PhD! in December (I think).  He&rsquo;s teaching C++
courses.</li>
<li>Lin and I have our cat Jennie and live in our house near (ahem, 24
minutes walk from) 新百合ヶ丘 station.</li>
<li>I recently bought a Crayon Shinchan book, and a Doraemon book, but
they are kinda beyond my understanding, unless I go slowly.</li>
<li>I am still using my last ever Macbook Pro.</li>
<li>I got rid of my iPhone and now use a waterproof Android phone,
(which was waterproof before any iPhones were waterproof.)</li>
<li>running out of steam in this SOML.</li>
<li>Oh, I have been using <a href="https://complice.co/?r=pgej30cphu">Complice</a> to get stuff done.  It is
thanks to Complice that I remembered I need to write an SOML today.</li>

<p>Thanks to Richard for giving me constructive feedback on the first
version which was basically The Agreements, which include a lot of
what we <em>can&rsquo;t</em> do.  He suggested putting some of the benefits on the
site first.</p>

<p>The court of support meetings are being held for seven weeks after the
LT1 I attended in Portland on March 9th weekend.  Each man will take
the role of a different archetype, King, Warrior, Magician, Lover, as
described in many places, including
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91781.King_Warrior_Magician_Lover">King, Warrior, Magician, Lover: Rediscovering the Archetypes of the Mature Masculine</a>,
and bite sized
<a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/2011/07/31/king-warrior-magician-lover-introduction/">Four Archetypes of the Mature Masculine on Art of Manliness</a>.</p>

<p>I was in the role of Magician this morning. I will be the Man in the
Middle next week, presenting my situation and getting guidance from
the archetypes around me.</p>

<p>Back in Japan now, on a bus headed to Tokyo from Narita airport.  This
bus is cheap and does not include electrical outlets like some airport
trains do, but I have a bit of charge available on my computer (74%
(was 79% when I started))</p>

<p>Ah; I can write Japanese for my lesson on Thursday.</p>

<p>Bunch of great guys here in Oregon for the LT1 and ST1 dual training.
I attended ST1 (Staff Training 1) in Perth last year and am attending
LT1 (Leadership Training 1) in Oregon this weekend.  Got to meet Alan
who I know from my online men&rsquo;s circle, and met Mike P with dredlocks
who I had met online as well.  Also met Richard and was like &ldquo;woah!&rdquo;
when I recognized I knew him from online.  Have not yet seen Scotty K,
who I also know from online, but I told him on Thursday that I&rsquo;d be
here and he said he might come down.</p>

<p>Sad news is that I am an idiot and did <em>not</em> tell Collenie Beanie that
I would be here, and I did not realize until she was like, &ldquo;wait,
which Portland?&rdquo; on FB that I had effed up.  I was so focused on just
the weekend that I did not tell anyone except the men here.  Colleen
said she would have driven down to see me!  Oh god I am such an idiot.
I will be back by next year though, so I will be hella sure to let her
know ahead of time!</p>

<p>Got the blessing of the community tonight before dinner and John H
started to fundraise a bit for me to help start MKP Japan.  He wrote
me a check which covers my flight over here.  Not sure how to cash it
though unless they have my bank in this area.  Talked to John for a
while tonight, and he seems to have a wide range of detailed info
about a wide range of historical, financial, naval, and medical
topics.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m leaving in about an hour for a weekend in Portland.  It&rsquo;s for a
training called <em>The Container of Leadership</em>.  I will be challenged

thoughts which unconsiously underly my perception of the world.</p>

<p>Five men in attendance tonight despite three regulars being absent.
Great to see men look inside to find their inner truth.</p>
