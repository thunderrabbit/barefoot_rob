<p>Been sick as a dog for most of it, but I have had a great time hanging
out at Michael Monkey&rsquo;s in Houston.  Thanks to Great Granny Good Witch
for driving me to the store today to buy clothes and toiletries which
should last a good while.</p>

<p>She has a lot lot lotta masks from around the world!</p>

<p>I have made a good start on the puzzle in the dining room, first
expanding the table, then adding more white backing, then rotating the
inner white backing to reduce waste.</p>

<p>Enjoyed chicken soup, fried chicken, orange gatorade, orange juice,
and chocolate.</p>

<p>Got a sense of what it would be like to have US political news on all
the time, and am glad I do not have that option in Japan.  Brain
overload!</p>

<p>Afterward, tried to scan a hand drawn blueprint through a glass table
scanner, but the lighting was too distant to make it work.</p>

<p>I felt sad to have to check out for a significant portion of the NWTA
this past weekend.  So annoying, and certainly not what I had in mind
for my trip!</p>

<p>Was great to meet awesome men.  I stayed with Steve R in Vancouver the
night before the weekend, and am now staying with Dave M in Victoria
the night after the weekend.  Headed to Houston tomorrow via Calgary.</p>

<p>Hopefully will get to see Marty and M and M twins in Houston!</p>

<p>In preparation for this trip, I started my packing list a few weeks
ago.</p>

<p>I had planned to copy it here, but for now, just imagine it.</p>

<p>I pre-packed most of the list a couple days ago, getting down to
computer, phone, and other
stuff I could not pack because I use it daily.</p>

<p>This morning I woke up early, and repacked everything, doublechecking
the list, and taking pictures of all of it, in some kind of just in
case scenario that will not happen.</p>

<p>This morning Lin drove me to the old man skin clinic to get a bit of
cream for my leg, and then met me at the Narita-bound Limousine Bus
stop at Shin Yurigaoka station.</p>

<p>We enjoyed lunch at Ootoya then hopped on the noon bus, which arrived
in Narita by 2pm.  So sweet of Lin to come with me!  We snuggled and
laughed in the back of the bus, then wandered around Narita for a bit
after I exchanged 10k and 20k yen for 105 CAD and 175 USD,
respectively (plus a bit of yen change).</p>

<p>We got soft serve ice cream and then wondered at all the shops in the
airport.</p>

<p>Sat down for about 30 minutes for more snuggles and then finally time
to say adieu.  After going through customs, I called Lin through Line
and waved bye to Lin looking down through the glass as I stayed in
place, walking up the down-escalator until someone else came.  (Almost
no one in line at security / customs.)</p>

<p>I got a quick pass for my new passport so I can whiz through
immigration in Japan until 2023.</p>

<p>Now I am at the gate, just a few minutes before boarding begins.</p>

<p>Today was the 3-weeks-out meeting for we staff of the
<a href="https://nwta.mkp.org/">New Warrior Training Adventure</a>
(<a href="https://nwta.mkp.org/">NWTA</a>) in British Columbia, Canada.  It was a
good meeting; we each have a buddy and each man on the call checked in
for his buddy, with the presumption that the buddies have been in
touch with each other.</p>

<p>I was inspired after the call and reached out to my two teams via email.
I look forward to meeting everyone!</p>

<li>Lin and I still have our cat Jennie, still keep her in at night,
still live in Asao-ku near the bottom of a hill.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m still working on Marble Track 3, trying to do at least 2 hours
of livestream per week.</li>
<li>I have been working on AB, getting tests added to cover the
important parts of the codebase.  I do not have a lot covered, but
10 tests is an order of magnitude more than 0.</li>
<li>Plus I figured out a way to test AJAX even though I cannot use
Javascript in my tests yet.  (run the AJAX call directly)</li>
<li>I have all my flights purchased for my trip to Vancouver, Houston,
Austin, Hawaii, all focused on MKP, but trying to see some of my
peeps.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, I messed up regarding seeing Colleenie Beanie
<em>again</em> this year.  I said I will sort it out for sure next year
and she said &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;   Fair enough.</li>
<li>I gotta let my Houston and Austin peeps know.</li>
<li>Have written two video briefs to make two MKP videos. One focused
on inviting men to our circle, and one focused on inviting support
for our circle and expanding into Japanese language.</li>
<li>I have recently been in touch with Brian (also in IT), Tony (truck
driver), and Frederick (change agent) via Zoom.  I asked for
support from them when I was beginning to get overwhelmed with all
the tasks across my variety of projects.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.marbletrack3.com/">Marble Track 3</a> has had its site
updated via Deligence.  I think we had some minor communication
problems, but the site looks super great compared to what it was.
Maybe I should hire some other peeps to work on it more.</li>
<li>Lesson starting now at Solid Square.</li>

<p>Just a couple days ago I got my tickets all sorted to staff two
different NWTA weekends and also attend the MKP USA Face to Face
weekend in Texas.</p>

<p>After pretty much settling on the plans, it was pointed out that
attending an IGFT might give me more of the training I am looking for,
but I trust this is the training / trip I need.</p>

<p>The goal of all this is to deepen the (emotional) work we can do in
Tokyo Men&rsquo;s Circle, by improving my facilitation skills.  That will
thereby hopefully inspire more men to take facilitation roles in the
group.</p>

<p>In addition, we are beginning to translate one of the workshops into
Japanese so we can invite Japanese men into the work as well.  For
that part, I am asking Takeshi to lead and facilitate; maybe we should
do a trial run and then a small version, then a real version.</p>

<p>TL;DR:
<a href="https://www.gofundme.com/launching-mankind-project-operations-in-japan">https://www.gofundme.com/launching-mankind-project-operations-in-japan</a></p>

<p>Just to confirm it is really me, I am posting a first person version
of the ManKind Project Japan GoFundme campaign
&ldquo;<a href="https://www.gofundme.com/launching-mankind-project-operations-in-japan">Launching ManKind Project Operations in Japan</a>&ldquo;
text here on my journal:</p>

<p><a href="https://mankindproject.org/">ManKind Project</a> challenges each man to
find and develop his own life’s mission, and to live that mission
fully with the support of a powerful network. ManKind Project has
become a global phenomenon.</p>

<p>A group of <a href="https://nwta.mkp.org">NWTA</a>-initiated men feel a deep
conviction that Japan will benefit greatly from the work. We are
building and bringing the MKP organization and way of life to Japan, a
nation that in 2014 saw on average 70 suicides a day with the vast
majority of them being men. We believe that with your help and our
dedicated men on the ground, we can access the necessary resources for
this exciting undertaking.</p>

<p>After growing Tokyo I-group for 3 years, I am leading this mission to
establish MKP Japan and now want to dedicate myself to this goal. To
support the organization in 2019, we are reaching out and asking for
help from other men and women who understand the value this work can
bring. We need people and services, such as translation and
interpreting, facilities for men’s circles, trainings, and lectures,
advertising, and we need more facilitation skills to deepen the
emotional work in men’s circles.</p>

<p>To improve my facilitation skills, I am planning on flying to the US
for the annual MKP Face to Face weekend in March, and to staff two
NWTA weekends. This we believe will bring our vision to the next
level. If anyone can help me out with this trip and help us with
getting this work to men in Japan for 2019 we would be grateful. If
you can donate air miles, contact me at rob(at)mkpjapan.org (a new
shiny address!!).  Your help will truly make a difference in expanding
MKP Japan.</p>

<p>Any donation will go towards supporting our activities for the 2019
budget of JPY 4,982,308, or approximately USD 46,000. This is
absolutely barebones for launching in a city as expensive as Tokyo. We
are going to make this happen and hope men from all over the world can
soon staff at NWTAs in Japan or simply sit in the circle with
us. Please join us in changing the world, one nation at a time.</p>

<p>It has taken me a long time to reach this point, but from
<a href="/journal/1997/11/15/new-warrior-training">being afraid of men</a> in
1997, I am now facilitating deep emotional work in men&rsquo;s circles every
week, both online and face to face in Tokyo.</p>

<p>I want to deepen my skills as a facilitator and have decided to step
more fully into this emotional awareness work.  To improve my facilitation
skills, I plan to staff two (2)
<a href="https://nwta.mkp.org">New Warrior Training Adventure</a> weekends, back
to back in March and April.  (full disclosure, I will also attend the
MKP Face to Face Gathering in March, but I do not completely know what
that will include.)</p>

<p>To this end, Jeremy was like, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you put together a Gofundme
page to help raise money for the trip?&rdquo;  Wow great idea!  Then Michael
was like, &ldquo;the trip is just the starting point; let&rsquo;s start Mankind
Project Japan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He worked out a bare bones budget for 2019, but it is still beyond
what I have ever thought about.  Life changing work.</p>
