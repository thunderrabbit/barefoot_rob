      <description> 13:10 Wednesday 20 January 2016 JST Ma! We found a nice house in 新百合ケ丘 which is close enough to Tokyo to work, and safe from tsunamis next time they come. The house is near the bottom of a hill, but it&#39;s still high enough to be safe hahaha. It has a cute sunroom for Mama and double windows for insulation everywhere else! Super excited!  </description>
