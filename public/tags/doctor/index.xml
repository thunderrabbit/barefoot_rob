      <description>12:46 Tuesday 06 August 2019 JST Soon I will go to the old man skin doctor who identifies skin conditions in about 5 seconds. Never have to wait in line. Always got things right so far.
I got a swollen bit in my ear lobe and he&amp;rsquo;s gonna cut it out today. Hopefully I can get pictures.
08:46 Wednesday 07 August 2019 JST No pictures. And quite a shock, which I posted on FB.</description>
