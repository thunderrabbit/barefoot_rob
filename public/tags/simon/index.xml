      <description>21:10 Saturday 16 September 2017 JST Simon drove me to Shin Osaka station so we could chat an hour longer. The last train for me to get home tonight leaves at 9:23pm, but I was able to get the 9:03pm train. Yay!</description>

      <description>18:50 Saturday 16 September 2017 JST Simon gave me a set of weights, including one which he found discarded on a hiking trail. We hiked up the trail, found the weight still there, collected it and cleaned it up in his shower.
He wanted to give me dumbells, but after I asked what would be good for my lower back, he suggested a T-bar kettlebell.

At one point we got a pic at the supermarket while he bought us beef for steak and potatoes.</description>

      <description>Day before yesterday  
Yesterday (written 17:38 Sunday 11 June 2017 JST)
Yesterday Simon and I had a great time walking from Harajuku to Tokyo Tower.
We caught a ride with Lin on her way to work, and saw an interesting accident underneath 246.

We walked for a bit on takeshita street, before it got crowded
 
then went to Yoyogi park.
He said Yoyogi park was great, and they have nothing like it in Osaka.</description>

      <description>09:14 Tuesday 15 November 2016 JST This thank you is from last week or so, but I just now put the images on my image site. Dad&amp;rsquo;s Pies are awesome!


The strong, silent type of pie that will give you advice, fix your car, give you shoulder rides, take you to sports games and teach you to ride a bike. They are the wholesome, dependable pies that people love to eat, since 1981.</description>
