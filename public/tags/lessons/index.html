<p>Four lessons at SCC today.  One was shorter than expected due to a
(hopefully small) medical emergency.  Third lesson on the third floor
featured discussions of the other three lessons and hearing they
students really enjoy my passion for the topics.</p>

<p>In the first adult lesson at JB, we flexed some reported speech
muscles with Side By Side book 1, where the target language is &ldquo;This
is a photograph of my son Bart.  He is riding a skateboard outside our
house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We changed it to be &ldquo;This is a photograph of me riding a skateboard in
from of my house&rdquo; and then &ldquo;That is a photograph of him riding a
skateboard in from of his house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the second adult lesson, Hide and I told Yutaro to look up WTC7.
Yutaro was 8 years old on Airplane Day (, the name Fred and I use for
the day).</p>

<p>In the last lesson, students came in one by one.  We talked about
movies for a bit and then read a brief story about a couple who gave
away a lot of their lottery winnings and thereby did not let the money
change them.  Kaori listened to it twice without reading.  Kyoko and
Misato both listened once and then read along the second time.</p>

<p>New vocab:</p>

<ul>
<li>ruin</li>
<li>indeed</li>
<li>owe</li>
</ul>

<p>I do not normally catastrophize things, but I am assuming my favorite
Japanese teacher got fed up with me not studying much the past few
weeks.  At the same time, I didn&rsquo;t notice that our lesson package on
<a href="https://www.italki.com/i/Bf6Gfd">iTalki</a> had run out of lessons, so
(even though she had said this timeslot was always reserved for me)
that was not the case today, it seems.</p>

<p>So anyway, I am sad about my fuckup if that is the case, but trust
that I will learn something about something.</p>

<p>Easy lessons today because Patrick was out.  After combining the 4:30
classes, we played a game with target language &ldquo;May I have a card,
please?,&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ＿＿＿＿-ing,&rdquo; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re ＿＿＿＿-ing,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hey ＿＿＿＿,
let&rsquo;s go ＿＿＿-ing,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sorry I can&rsquo;t.  I&rsquo;m busy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Matt is also out today, so I&rsquo;ll teach his 6pm lesson.</p>

<p>The kids lessons were pretty good today.  The two new students (one in
each of my first two classes) are still not speaking, and I can&rsquo;t tell
if they are acting shy or don&rsquo;t understand..  anytime they speak, they
get the right answer, but getting them to speak is a stretch.  esp
with the other kids being so chatty.  I ain&rsquo;t sure how to handle it.</p>

<p>Just taught three lessons at T near Lazona.  I really enjoy these
lessons because the students always have questions / topics /
something to practice.  The first two lessons were 30 minutes each.
The first student talked about a wooden doll which carries tea cups.
The next student talked about a record player.  The third lesson was
scheduled to be an hour, but there was a bit of miscommunication and
we ended up starting 15 minutes late.</p>

<p>Actually, this student was the best of the three today, probably
because she used to live in the US.  It was our first time to meet.
She has the same first name as my old student who makes bears and
loves roller coasters.</p>

<p>I was a bit late to lesson with Sarupapa tonight on account of not
having been to this particular location before, getting lost on the
way there, and being late to start heading that direction because I
was begging the Softbank guy to give me the code to let me change my
phone number to a new carrier.</p>

<p>The timeslot used to be for MM but now is for SS, Sarupapa and
Sarumama.  They&rsquo;re both progressing nicely, nearly enough for me to be
inspired to study Japanese but gah I&rsquo;m soo dumb (that I don&rsquo;t).</p>

<p>Asking for more money seems challenging to me, but it looks like it
will be worth the fear.</p>

<p>It helps that I&rsquo;m gainfully employed already.  I can afford for them
to say &ldquo;nope&rdquo; and find somebody else.</p>
