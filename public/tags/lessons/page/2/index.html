<p>During the first half of his lesson, Sarupapa asked me about MKP and I
told him as much as I was able with my broken Japanese and English
hybrid sentences.  He said it seemed interesting; I wonder if he&rsquo;d
eventually be interested in attending I-group with us.</p>

<p>Sarumama came after that and we went over her homework.  She&rsquo;s really
improving and would be a great inspiration if I wasn&rsquo;t so frickin&rsquo;
lazy to study Japanese!  blarg.</p>

<p>Then we went to Thai dinner in a nice small (8 bar seats) downstairs
Thai restaurant near Yoyogi Station.  I felt all なつかしい to be
sortof in Thai-mode of greetings with respectful prayer hands which
I&rsquo;ve continued to do since being there for just 3 months &hellip; five
years ago!</p>

<p>Goodness I loved that life.</p>

<p>I taught two lessons in Shinagawa.  First was a private lesson where I
asked questions about her hobby: birdwatching. She seems pretty
dedicated to birdwatching and was pretty good speaking once she spoke,
but seemed really shy.</p>

<p>Second lesson featured two chatty women, who were relatively low, but
really tried hard.  I know logically this is what I need to do to
improve my Japanese: speak, speak, speak, and speak!</p>

<p>Had lessons with both M &amp; M tonight.  During both lessons I tried to
do more role play than I normally do with them.  They tend to veer
toward just checking homework instead of actually practicing English.
M had done a huge amount of homework (as she usually does), but I
didn&rsquo;t check it all tonight; I was like, &ldquo;okay, let&rsquo;s practice this
part..&rdquo;  (meet vs see)</p>

<p>Great!  It seems I hae three consistent lessons on Tuesdays now.
Thanks to Mutsumi and Mutsumi, and K and Y.  There&rsquo;s a bit of tag team
between Mutsumi and Y but Mutsumi and K are planning to study each week.</p>

<p>Glad and happy yay!</p>

<p>Chapters with Muchan and Muchan were great tonight; Mucchan has been
working hard on his stuff and Muchan always works hard so it&rsquo;s
lovely.  Sarupapa joined Muchan and explained some of the requirements
for his fabric designs.  I&rsquo;m actually writing with the design in front
of my screen now so I can only see part of what I&rsquo;m typing.  Hmm maybe
I will use this as the first chance to take a photo that will be only
available on b.robnugen.com and not have already been available
elsewhere.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a bit tired so that sentence didn&rsquo;t make as much asnse as I
planned.</p>

<p>Dang my phone locks up a lot after I take photos.  Why?  Why does iOS
suck so much?  I take the photo, thn click the view photo button and
the screen goes fuzzy and locks up until the phone boots after about a
minutes.  Swear to Jeebuz I&rsquo;m never buying Apple hardware again.</p>

<p>Sarupapa took us out to dinner after the lesson and I&rsquo;m headed home
now.</p>

<p>Yoshie may introduce a friend for lessons with me.  Yay!</p>

<p>Mutsumi recently asked if I could create a vector pattern, and I spent
some time looking at
<a href="https://weaving-tool.appspot.com/maker/">weaving software</a>
<a href="www.weavemaker.com/downloads/">packages</a>&hellip; but it appears that it
will require more conventional image software..  I plan to use
<a href="https://www.mapdiva.com/products-page/">Artboard</a>, which I&rsquo;ve had for
a while but not really used (nor registered).  This project would give
me an excuse to do both!</p>

<p>I love teaching at Toshiba because the topics are so sciencey and
interesting!  Today Tomomi met me in Kawasaki station and introduced
me to some new people at Toshiba.  I had gone in earlier, thinking I
would have lessons with the attendants, but they were all like, &ldquo;ummm
not today!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Good thing I called JB, who was like, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry.  Wait for Tomomi
and she&rsquo;ll get you sorted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While there, I watched one of the demonstrations with liquid
nitrogen.</p>

<p>Spoilers!:</p>

<p>They dip a flower then crush it, dip a rubber ball then drop (and
shatter) it, dip an inflated balloon to watch it shrink (and
reinflate), and dip an inflated clear plastic bag to watch it shrink
as liquid appears on the inside.</p>

<p>Yesterday around 17:43, JB called me all, &ldquo;yeah can you come teach
from 6pm to 9pm <em>today</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That worked out nicely!  I had asked JB for a single lesson <em>off</em>
yesterday, so I could go to Kagoshima.  I was therefore scheduled not
to work, but got 3 hours instead of 1.  Thank you, angels!</p>

<p>While there, JB offered me 1.5 hours of lessons on Thursday nights.
That&rsquo;s tonight, right after I hang out with Soness!</p>
