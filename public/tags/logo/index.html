<li>I met Yuri Logo today to talk about making a logo for my brand.
She was recommended by Rin so I was like yay!  She asked lots of
questions and said she had good ideas for it.  I could see in her
smile the excitement and I felt good about that.</li>
<li>I will be working with Rin in a life coaching capacity.  I look
forward to an accountability partner and learning some new
facilitation techniques.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.marbletrack3.com">Marble Track 3 website</a> now has a
Construction section, which shows some of the snippets.  Not all
the snippets are there, and they are not all fully fleshed out yet,
but I look forward to finishing that section, especially if I can
do it via a data file which can be parsed in differen ways.</li>
<li>Lin has been enjoying her new job and will soon get to have flex
time hours, going from 10am to 6pm.  Hopefully the trains will be a
bit less packed in the mornings.</li>
<li>We bought a laser printer recently.  I did it out of frustration of
buying tons of ink for the inkjet printer, and now I realize what a
great investment it is.  Now I can print pages like wheeee instead
of having a gut wrenching wonder if I would get streaks in the
pages.</li>
<li>I used the printer to print a flyer for our Japanese workshop
coming up in July.</li>
</ol>

<p>Some people could not scan the QR code, so I made one with a normal
square QR code <a href="https://b.robnugen.com/mkpjapan/workshops/2019/Japanese_Journey_of_Heart_July_square_QR_code_2019.png">https://b.robnugen.com/mkpjapan/workshops/2019/Japanese_Journey_of_Heart_July_square_QR_code_2019.png</a></p>

<li>I just recently decided to plan on attending a workshop in Houston
in October.  (ShadowWork Facilitator Training) I have not gotten it
sorted out with the organizer yet; I asked him if I have the
prerequisites.</li>
<li>I bought <a href="https://wanb.us/">https://wanb.us/</a> which I might use for my Urbit star, ~wanbus.</li>
<li>I created a template for something like a Five Minute Journal
(which takes more than five minutes, but gives a structure to what
I write).  Kinda like a captain&rsquo;s log, tracking some different
metrics: eating, sleeping, meditation, books, exercise, kisses</li>
<li>I got the idea from Hiro, who has apparently been doing it for years.</li>
<li>After doing these for a few days, I thought it would be cool to be
able to print customized templates for people.  So if you have a
template you&rsquo;d like to print, send it to me and I can print it
out.</li>
<li>I think my knee chair has got to go cause it might be hurting my
knees and hips. I wanna get a yoga ball chair (again).  I will
request one on Freecycling Tokyo.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s now June 5th.  Yesterday I did my first session with Rin, and
came out with seven affirmations, organically discovered by doing
a (n apparently NLP) process that could be called &ldquo;What do I
gain?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;What do I gain by not following my dreams?&rdquo;  (snip long chain of
answers and question repetitions featuring new answer) &ldquo;I know
people love me.&rdquo;  Wait, what??</li>
<li>It also makes sense though, in my experience of facilitating
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at Risk&rdquo; hundreds of times.  When I go through that series
of questions, I end up with &ldquo;I will be alone&rdquo; (which is about the
opposite of &ldquo;I know people love me.&rdquo;</li>
