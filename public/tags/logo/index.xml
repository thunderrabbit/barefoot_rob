      <description>20:29 Saturday 01 June 2019 JST  I met Yuri Logo today to talk about making a logo for my brand. She was recommended by Rin so I was like yay! She asked lots of questions and said she had good ideas for it. I could see in her smile the excitement and I felt good about that. I will be working with Rin in a life coaching capacity. I look forward to an accountability partner and learning some new facilitation techniques.</description>
