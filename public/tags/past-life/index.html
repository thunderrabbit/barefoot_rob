<p>I put a question mark on the title because I cannot really prove the
visions are related to past lives, but this is a fun way to guide
people through a process to see what could be their past lives.</p>

<pre><code>Each participant gets into a relaxed position, usually either
sitting in a chair, or laying down, or otherwise sitting against
something comfortable.

Spend a few minutes leading the participants through a relaxation
process, whereby they let their bodies relax and keep their minds
awake.  Once they are in this mind awake / body asleep mode,
invite them to imagine getting up and leaving the room.  Guide
them to imagine traveling far away, whether by vehicle, or through
a cave, or through a forest, or by any other means which takes
them from the familiar, to the unfamiliar, and guide them to
arrive somewhere new, yet familiar.

Give the participants a chance to explore the familiar area,
including seeing other inhabitants of the area and moving around
and communicating with them.

Once they have explored the area, lead the participants gently
back the way they came, allowing them to have a clear memory of
what happened and what they heard and saw. (say things like
&quot;coming back slowly, you clearly remember what you experienced,&quot;
etc) Once their awareness focuses back on their physical bodies,
give them a chance to write down what they experienced.  Do not
speak until everyone is pretty much done writing.

The whole process is a state of light hypnosis, and everyone will
still have full control and awareness of where their physical body
is.  They will be able to come back in a moment's notice if they
choose.

Each process will take about 20 or 30 minutes.

<p class=date>3:07pm Saturday 10 January 1998</p>

<p><font size=-1>(transcribed from my diary)</font>
<p>
I just had an incredible experience at Kathy Fey&rsquo;s.  She is my body work professional type person, using Cranio-Sachral balancing, Reiki (sp) and massage to keep my body happy.
<p>
I&rsquo;ve been doing body work with her for a while and today she focused on my left hip. There&rsquo;s been a bit of nagging almost pain there and to determine what is the deal with it, we did a &ldquo;dialogue.&rdquo;
<p>
I went to my meditation hill in my mind and sat gently there for a bit.  Then Kathy invited someone to help guide us with the process.  A woman in white walked up and when prompted, invited us to refer to her as Mother.
<p>
Kathy asked about the source of the injury and I visioned a stabbing downward from behind with a bayonette during a war. Someone stabbed me back there and I collapsed during the Civil War and I wasn&rsquo;t able to see my family and I felt so sad and cried and cried on her table.  I drug my body dragging my left leg and ended up in the woods, falling asleep at night and dying that night.
<p>
Kathy asked if I could see who had stabbed me and I saw his face, green hat and brown moustache and it was Forest! in a previous life who had stabbed me.  Before I recognized him I forgave him and was really surprised when I saw who it was.  I explained to Kathy how I know him this lifetime.
<p>
We called to the hill anyone that I wronged during the war and about 7 or 12 men were there.  I felt I did not see their faces when I killed them as they were too far away.  I suspect I shot them.  I asked them all for forgiveness and was forgiven by some but not by all the men.
<p>
We let them go about their way and asked Mother if we could release the tension in my hip.  She said Yes but not as quickly as I would like.  We asked if there was anything else and she said she was so proud of me and my work.  I cried and cried again to hear that.  Wonderful
<p>
Mother had to leave so we thanked her and let her go.  We need only ask to have her return.
<p>
Wow.  I was amazed by the experience.  Part of me wants proof but I am currently content to believe it is precisely true.</p></p>
