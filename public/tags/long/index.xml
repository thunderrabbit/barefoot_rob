      <description>20:42 Wednesday 09 January 2019 JST Today was a long day, starting with recording a first draft of a video for my first GoFundMe campaign, then two TY lessons, two MKP meetings, lunch with Tomoko, then an hour chillin with &amp;ldquo;a flower in each hand&amp;rdquo; behind the desk of the Sweets Party Attendants, having a non-lesson with them because they have nothing going on.
During this non-lesson, Tomoko showed me her &amp;ldquo;personal こたつ&amp;rdquo; which consisted of a heater under her desk and a blanket strategically arranged to drape down over her legs.</description>

      <description>(transcribed from Book Six 1:54pm JST Sunday 28 June 2009 (day 14340))
7:50PM Friday 3 December 1993 Day (Page44)
I have decided to not keep track of exactly what day I&#39;m on each day. I&#39;ll keep this pointer back to page 44 that will tell me the last recorded day count so I can recalculate it. The only reason for this is that maybe the days will go by faster, not that they are going slowly now.</description>
