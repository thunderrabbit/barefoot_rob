      <description>14:14 Sunday 16 June 2019 JST Fun in the sun today at SOGO Bootcamp. We had to adjust our normal workout area due to puddles, but all good and lots of fun. I remet Anuj, Valeria, Lisa, Alex, Ben. Got to see Haruo and Jim again as they led ultimate frisbee after bootcamp.
We played until about 1:18pm with about 6 on 6 down to 4 on 4 as people had to go.</description>
