      <description>20:07 Sunday 22 April 2018 JST I decided to recreate this reverse fishtank in Minecraft, but for some reason it is all dark when I view it from the outside. Not sure how to make the underwater view look lighter.
I created the tank using a fill command, decided to expand it, and made a huge area&amp;hellip;
I think the command was something like this
/fill 4000 46 -5000 4050 50 -4800 glass_blocks 0 hollow  Then I carpeted the area with grass using something like this</description>

      <description>17:37 Wednesday 17 January 2018 JST 時々ときどきマインクラフトと 言いうゲームで遊あそ んでます。なんでこのゲームが好す きなのかはゲームの中なか で子供こどもの時とき の夢ゆめを作 つくれるからです。木き の上うえに家 いえが欲ほしかった ら、どうず作つくって下く ださい。海うみの 下したにグラス屋根 やねの人参にんじんの 農場のうじょう？これも作 つくれます。山やま の間あいだにグラスの水 みずの滑すべり 台だいがいいな。大丈夫 だいじょうぶです。
Sometimes I play the game Minecraft. Why do I like this game? In the game, I can create my childhood dreams. Want a house in tree? Go ahead and make it! Want a glass roofed carrot farm in the bottom of the ocean? Go head; you can make it.</description>

      <description>20:43 Saturday 13 January 2018 JST I discovered that Bitquest now has a Doge server. I jumped on and added 25 Doge to my wallet there. dognamedsteve helped me by getting me started with a compass, diamond pick, diamond shovel, chestplate and some other basic gear. Nice! I started digging a burrow after walking off the end of a road near a heart-looking room up in the trees.</description>

      <description>00:45 Wednesday 27 January 2016 CST Yay! Fred and I have finally played on the Minecraft (local) server that I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on for well over a year. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot harder when I&amp;rsquo;m in gamemode 0! (that&amp;rsquo;s zero, not one.)
We&amp;rsquo;ve barely gotten started seeing stuff, mostly just trying to stay alive for a single night while monsters try to kill us. Creepers have exploded on my garden, and in the middle of my front yard.</description>

      <description>23:26 Sunday 03 January 2016 JST Minecraft made some neat edges between Chicago and the mainland. I then used MCEdit to delete some chunks which were then recreated in game. Interesting results resulted.</description>

      <description>20:51 Thursday 31 December 2015 JST Huge props to whomever created a scale model of Chicago in Minecraft. I tried to make a single .schematic file to import the entire map, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t work.. probably too big for MCEdit. So I broke it up in to 7 8 schematics. The eighth is but a sliver between the 6th and 7th. Though I highly doubt anyone will care, it&amp;rsquo;s relatively trivial to archive them online.</description>

      <description>14:12 Monday 30 November 2015 JST D&amp;rsquo;oh! HAhaha I tried out survival mode after giving myself a kick ass diamond sword and 32 spawned skeletons. They nearly killed me, and then a creeper finished me off, plus destroyed a small section of roller coaster. hahah oops! I think I repaired it in a way that all the previously linked tracks are linked again. I tested one track and it seemed correct.</description>

      <description>19:53 Saturday 14 November 2015 JST Interesting!
Today while reviewing the world I set up for Fred, I found a note I left for him 1 year ago, to the day.

In other news, I made an underwater glass tunnel</description>

I played Minecraft for an hour and a half, during which time someone typed GoT which I recognized must be Game of Thrones, which Fred just suggested I watch. I watched the second episode (after having seen the first yesterday or so).</description>

In Minecraft, I built a frame around the four-way train station I downloaded. For good measure, I put a pool on top. I loaded the pool with squid, but they all died. Poor squid!!
Also started working on a waterslide.

Overall, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to make a really interesting world for Fred to visit when he visits. Hmm also gotta buy minecraft for him for Christmas.</description>

And by add, I mean using MCEdit, I injected an schematic of the Empire State Building (unfinished) by Avalanche_Ali
I placed it in the middle of a plain at first, but then thought it would look weirder in a forest, so I put it there instead.
Beautifully, without having really tried hard, the minecart track I had built went straight into the center of the building, aligned perfectly.</description>

Hahaha I got about 1&amp;frasl;2 finished building tall walls around the pyramid I made for Fred in minecraft before I found the new /fill command.
  
Boom done!
 
Doesn&amp;rsquo;t always work on leaves, though.</description>

Back when Minefold was in business, I paid them to host a private world for me. They went out of business and I downloaded the world, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t get it working on my local machine until recently.
Since then, I built a relatively long minecart track in the nether put a large portal at the end of it. Delightfully, the overworld portal happened to be quite close to a desert.</description>

Yesterday was similar to today except it was more like minecraft, porn, sleep, eat, porn, minecraft, eat.
In minecraft, I&amp;rsquo;m building a roller coaster or two (using creative mode).</description>

I had 24 free hours, and used up 14 in a couple weeks, so that&amp;rsquo;s an hour per day. 2000 hours should last for 2000 days or until 11 October 2018. For $48 * 2, not so bad.
I bought all those hours because today is the last day they are selling &amp;ldquo;prepaid time&amp;rdquo;

This is a view from inside the hole I&amp;rsquo;m digging as part of a Minecraft art project I&amp;rsquo;ve got in mind. I plan to put a stop-action animation of the hole being dug on youtube. Earlier, while researching stuff for work, I found bigdinosaur.org, on which a blog entry was posted about something work related. mySQL or Javascript or some such. Anyway, in the side bar he mentioned he liked Minecraft.</description>
