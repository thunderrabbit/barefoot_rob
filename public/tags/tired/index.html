                        <p>I chose not to go out to dinner with them to Ninfa&rsquo;s tonight.  Pretty
much super tired and need to sleep, but it may have been good to go so
I would be forced more onto this timezone.</p>

<p>I plan to go buy candles at Kroger, but not sure when I will.</p>

<p>Today went by super slow at first with a bunch of theory, but then
when it got to the practice, everyone was like &ldquo;whoah&rdquo; with questions
and head proverbially spinning.</p>

<p>Super great to see John and Rhonda.</p>

                        <p>(written 21:32 Wednesday 18 September 2019 JST)</p>

<p>Headed toward home on Nambu Line now after waking up at 4:30 (after
one sleep cycle) and doing my morning routine (write dreams, write
gratitude, meditate, brush teeth, etc) then headed to work in Kawasaki
for JB in Solid Square.  Sayuri came about 15 minutes late and was the
only student in attendance.</p>

<p>Headed to JR Kawasaki afterward to meet やなさん but he ended up
having to cancel for some reason.  I was a bit grouchy like why
couldn&rsquo;t he tell me ahead of time, but bah.</p>

<p>Got some food at a bakery and then headed to DiCE internet cafe and
slept for a couple of hours then ended up browsing Instagram and
clicking the little hearts because I heard that&rsquo;s what we gotta do
these days to make connections online.</p>

<p>After seeing Menya&rsquo;s post about too many calories, I was inspired to
have only one (1) cup of soft serve ice cream at the cafe (normally I
eat 3 or 4, easily).</p>

<p>Headed to JB school for kid lessons then adult lessons and wondered
about my place in my universe.  All the while, my blog entry is
brewing in my head.  I choose what I do (and no one else really
cares).  But I haven&rsquo;t really started the entry because of the message
in its title.</p>

<p>And also because my site is effed up now and I need to fix my theme to
work with latest version of Hugo (or something).</p>

<p>It looks like I am going to have to spend a day tracking down how to
make my site work again; I wrote to the main creator of Hugo, but no
reply.  When I posted on the forums last time, I ended up paying too
much for shoddy work that crept up in price.</p>

<p>Akiko and I went to her train line&rsquo;s side of Akihabara, and ate at the
Indian restaurant on the 9th floor of the BIC Camera building.
Bottomless cheese nan seems like a good deal until I eat the second
one!</p>

<p>We talked about her upcoming trip overseas and pets and other stuff I
am too tired to remember, much less write.  Oh, we also talked about
commas and when to use them.  Tough question!</p>

<p>Her Japanese teacher told her to add 、 when she wanted to say ね.
That&rsquo;s as good as most rules I&rsquo;ve heard for commas in English.</p>

<p>These are notes she wrote in the last three lessons.</p>

<p>Well, I missed the first day of the month by 3 minutes.  I have been
zoned out in front of my computer longer than 3 minutes so oh well.</p>

<p>Logged 6 hours of work and noticed how much longer it will take.  At
10 minutes per line, and 400 more lines to change that&rsquo;s 4000 minutes
(hopefully max!), but that is just to get rid of a single singleton.</p>

<p>I am tired enough that I cannot do the math in my head.  4000 minutes
/ 60 = 65 hours..  dang that has got to be too much.  5 minutes per
line and we get 32 hours.</p>

<p>Anyway, the main point is that I feel shame for mis-guessing how long
it would take.  But I gotta let AB know the estimate.</p>

<p>I think I will start up their new DB server and use the existing web
server and new DB server for a bit, and then spin up new DB server
with Ubuntu 18.</p>

<p>I usuually set my alarm for 5am on Mondays and Wednesdays so I can
leave the house at 5:45am.  This morning I turned off my 5am alarm and
planned to snooze until my second alarm, but the phone was in silent
mode so that alarm did not sound.  Fortunately, Lin had set an alarm
for 5:35.  I had already packed my computer so I got out early enough
to catch my preferred train, featuring enough seats that I can sit and
write, or snooze, which I plan to do now.</p>

<p>Today wasn&rsquo;t as productive as I had planned, but I got some good stuff
done.</p>

<p>4:30am meeting with Boysen, and should have a landing page for The
Men&rsquo;s Work soon.</p>

<p>8:00am IL lesson in which we talked about Tsukiji and 2020 Olympics
<a href="https://the-japan-news.com/news/article/0004879769">https://the-japan-news.com/news/article/0004879769</a></p>

<p>came home to work on MT3, but ended up just sleeping</p>

<p>7:00pm Tokyo Men&rsquo;s Circle <a href="https://tokyo.mypowercircle.org/">https://tokyo.mypowercircle.org/</a></p>

<p>8:06pm someone killed themselves in Seijogakuenmae (a station along my
train line)</p>

<p>9:30pm though trains were slow, got to ride from Yoyogi Uehara with
Lin.  In Yoyogi-Koen, we waited until the next train arrived,
terminated, and had everyone come over to our train so we could go to
Yoyogi Uehara.</p>

<p>11:30pm wrote this entry after arriving home and taking a shower.</p>

<p>&rdquo;?????&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;April Fools!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Finally got back to SOGO today and it was touch!  Camelia (sp) saw me
and was like, &ldquo;remember me??&rdquo; and I was like, &ldquo;I remember your <em>face</em>&ldquo;
(could be an insult, but wasn&rsquo;t in this case), and she reminded me she
had volunteered for <a href="https://peaceboat.org/">Peace Boat</a> since I last
saw her.  So neat to hear that it&rsquo;s growing but still has the same
genki energy as before.  She said in 2020 they are going to have a new
eco-friendly ship!</p>

<p>After my morning lesson I had a big gap during which I had a big nap
because dang I was tired.  I seem to have gotten over the <em>jet lag</em>
(new vocabulary word for some students today).  I was roused by a
security guard when I tried to nap on a grassy field on 3F of Lazona
(next to Eggs N Things (or something)).  But before he roused me, I
got to sleep there about an hour or so, so that was nice.</p>

<p>They are putting a new green fake grass surface in Lazona, to give it
a (fake) park-like atmosphere.  It looks nice; I wonder how functional
it will be.</p>

<p>Headed to JB at 3:30 and just finished a bit ago.  7pm lesson featured
a discussion of WTC7, and 8pm lesson featured intonation practice.
How are you?  How are <em>you</em>?</p>

<p>Today while running to catch my preferred train, I stubbed my toe.  It
didn&rsquo;t hurt all that much, but is just annoying that now I will have
to wear shoes for a bit while it heals.  I forgot to take a picture
right after it happened, but I posted one on twitter tonight.</p>
