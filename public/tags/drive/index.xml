      <description>23:37 Tuesday 11 October 2016 JST Lin is driving me to Narita airport because my check-in time is 7:25 tomorrow, and there are no trains that leave early enough to make it on time (if I leave from our house tomorrow).
We&amp;rsquo;re going to stay in a hotel (rar) and after she drops me off at the airport tomorrow, she plans to go back to the hotel to enjoy their onsen, buffet breakfast, etc, before checking out.</description>
