      <description>11:41 Wednesday 02 December 2015 JST I cannot currently load https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js because this &amp;ldquo;free&amp;rdquo; wifi I&amp;rsquo;m on disallows https, so I can&amp;rsquo;t run my page, so&amp;hellip; oh wait I don&amp;rsquo;t need jquery to work on a different thing, so I can work on that thing instead. I was thinking it was like coding without compiling, so it reminded me of stories where programmers had to check their code N times before sending it off to be run on the mainframe, and any error would mean losing a day of work.</description>
