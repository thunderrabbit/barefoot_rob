      <description>22:22 Friday 06 November 2015 JST Email I wrote to Fred:
I just ran a script that was supposed to create thumbnails of images as needed, but it created a bunch of 0 byte files in a bunch of directories. So I want a script which will delete 0 byte files and then a script which will delete empty directories. I&#39;ll run the second script N times (10 should be enough) because they&#39;re not toooo deep.</description>

      <description> 10:31 Wednesday 22 April 2015 JST I have to change trains one station away from my station because this train terminates there. I probably won&amp;rsquo;t even get to sit down on the next train. First world problems.
10:36 Well, I got a seat (actually five seats), but I had to wait on the platform for like 3 minutes. Maybe 4. fml *

      <description>12:10 Friday 17 April 2015 JST As Lin left this morning, she was like, &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t let Jennie out!&amp;rdquo; and I was like, &amp;ldquo;of course!&amp;rdquo; and I noticed that I could put the chain on the door so it only opens this much she wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to get out. That way she&amp;rsquo;ll be safe and happy!
oh shit she getting out! I tried to close the door to carefully hold her without crushing her (cats hate that!</description>
