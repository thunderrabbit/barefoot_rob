      <description>13:39 Tuesday 07 November 2017 JST Okay it&amp;rsquo;s been a couple days, but we had a lovely weekend in Shimoda. So glad that Lin joined us! She said she had a great time. The weekend schedule was kinda freestyle, which caused a bit of consternation for some, but did not affect things too badly. I enjoyed getting to know everyone a bit better.
Yoga on Saturday morning was originally led by Lisa, but turned into acro yoga with people being angels, superman, partners, flippers, etc.</description>

      <description>14:09 Monday 10 July 2017 JST On my way to Inbox Zero, I found these images which Christine scanned for me in 2011! I cannot remember if she scanned them before or after Lin and I had our wedding, but I know she scanned them twice, to get higher resolution! Thank you, Christine!</description>
