      <description>21:54 Tuesday 27 October 2015 JST From the toy store today I received a maze puzzle which had been broken by some careless use. They said they couldn&amp;rsquo;t sell it, so they gave it to me. yay!
I think I can fix it, if I can just loosen one particular screw holding the broken piece on the puzzle.
If I can loosen that screw, I can take it all apart, fix the broken bits and put it back together.</description>

      <description>18:39 Tuesday 18 August 2015 JST At the toy store I found a take-apart puzzle featuring two loosely linked nails bent into trianglish G shapes. They are loosely linked, but they&amp;rsquo;re hard as nails, and I cannot seem to get them separated. Seriously, it looks like they&amp;rsquo;ve been mis-created (with automation, is that even possible??) or somehow &amp;ldquo;forced&amp;rdquo; into an unsolvable state. But they are so hard, I can&amp;rsquo;t seem to force them back.</description>

I went to the toy store today and they presented me with a puzzle they had been unable to take apart. It was like a &amp;ldquo;secret box&amp;rdquo; puzzle, but was not hollow inside. I set my timer for 30 minutes to make sure I left in time for Mutsumi&amp;rsquo;s lesson, then went to work.
I was able to solve it in about 25 minutes.</description>

Wow the puzzle survived the week. My friend at the shop suggested it&amp;rsquo;s because it&amp;rsquo;s on a shelf too high for young kids to reach.</description>

I went to the toy shop near the Lotus dealership near Harajuku station. しばたさん recognized me, and I was all お待たせしました [sorry to keep you waiting] when I came in.
They have a cool set of blocks to make marble tracks, including some big ones with near-baseball sized wooden balls that roll down the paths.
I showed her a video of marble track 2, but certainly didn&amp;rsquo;t make her sit through the whole thing.</description>
