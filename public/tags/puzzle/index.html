<p>From the toy store today I received a maze puzzle which had been
broken by some careless use.  They said they couldn&rsquo;t sell it, so they
gave it to me.  yay!</p>

<p>I think I can fix it, if I can just loosen one particular screw
holding the broken piece on the puzzle.</p>

<p>If I can loosen that screw, I can take it all apart, fix the broken
bits and put it back together.  (and give it to Fred for winter
solstice.)</p>

<p>At the toy store I found a take-apart puzzle featuring two loosely
linked nails bent into trianglish G shapes.  They are loosely linked,
but they&rsquo;re hard as nails, and I cannot seem to get them separated.
Seriously, it looks like they&rsquo;ve been mis-created (with automation, is
that even possible??) or somehow &ldquo;forced&rdquo; into an unsolvable state.
But they are so hard, I can&rsquo;t seem to force them back.</p>

<p>I took a picture of a solvable version and an unsolvable version, so
get ready to see those images online within the next 1000 years when I
think about it, have time, <em>and</em> have internet access to post them.</p>

<p>I went to the toy store today and they presented me with a puzzle they
had been unable to take apart.  It was like a &ldquo;secret box&rdquo; puzzle, but
was not hollow inside.  I set my timer for 30 minutes to make sure I
left in time for Mutsumi&rsquo;s lesson, then went to work.</p>

<p>I was able to solve it in about 25 minutes.</p>

<p>The guy saw that I had done it and came over to investigate; I showed
him how it went together.  While doing so, I dropped one of the pieces
and it came unglued!  D&rsquo;oh!!  That&rsquo;s gonna be hard to put back
together so precisely, but they (of course) said it was no problem.</p>

<p>I considered buying it (out of guilt) because I had planned to buy it
if I hadn&rsquo;t been able to solve it before having to go to the lesson..</p>

<p>But I didn&rsquo;t buy it, nor did I take a picture of it (for Fred: hey,
here&rsquo;s what I didn&rsquo;t buy for you).</p>

<p>Wow the puzzle survived the week.  My friend at the shop suggested
it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s on a shelf too high for young kids to reach.</p>

<p>I went to the toy shop near the Lotus dealership near Harajuku
station.  しばたさん recognized me, and I was all お待たせしました
[sorry to keep you waiting] when I came in.</p>

<p>They have a cool set of blocks to make marble tracks, including some big ones with near-baseball sized wooden balls that roll down the paths.</p>

<p>I showed her a video of marble track 2, but certainly didn&rsquo;t make her
sit through the whole thing.</p>

<p>She offered me a seat, though, when I got stuck trying to put together
a take-apart puzzle. Basically two rings bent in two directions until
they were horseshoe shaped.  It took me far too long to figure it out;
I was mm away from the solution, but hadn&rsquo;t wanted to squeeze them,
which is what was required to solve it.</p>

<p>Next time I go in, I&rsquo;ll solve the next take-apart puzzle: two giant
nails bent and interlinked.</p>
