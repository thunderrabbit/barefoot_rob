Our Trip to Austrailia 1985 It is 6:00 (Houston) 4:00 (San Fran.) Wednesday, June the 12th. We are on the way from Houston to San Fransisco and we are flying over some snow capped mountains in California. The plane ride has been fairly boring except when we are low enough to tell what things are.</description>
