      <description>15:58 Sunday 28 April 2019 JST Today we got our bicycle parking passes, which we applied for in June 2016. I bought a 3 month pass. Lin got 1 month because she is less certain she will like riding more than walking/bussing because of the hills between our place and the station.
I figure 3 months will give me a pretty good sense of how much I like biking to the station (bicycle parking area).</description>

      <description>21:57 Sunday 20 May 2018 JST Great day at a park, but there were briars in the grass. Got to talk to Aaron for quite a bit and catch up with Francine who invited him. My student Misato attended and joined our little outing to find a nearby geocache which she was actually the one to find.
I napped for 30 minutes in the tent that went largely unused.</description>

      <description>21:36 Saturday 24 June 2017 JST Super great to find out there&amp;rsquo;s neat park so close to our house! I had no idea how big it was, but there is a pavilion, museum, cool sculpture, frisbee field, and more inside the park.
Met Kai in the station and chowed at Ootoya, because we were hungry and not sure when everyone else was going to meet. Shoulda asked because first thing we did in the park was lay out a big spread of food on blue tarp and chow.</description>

Today Lin and I are at Charu&amp;rsquo;s house (with the whole family of her generation and under).
I accompanied Makarin and Takumi to the park where we played games similar to Calvinball. While Takumi made up rules in realtime, Mikarin was like はいはい.
I rather liked my game, basically throw a rubber ball onto a 3D monkey-bar grid and get points based on where it first touches the ground.</description>

Great day at a park near Yoga station, though I&amp;rsquo;ve forgotten its name.
Travis and I played frisbee, and were joined by some young kids, pretty much all of whom could throw better than I would expect given their apparent ages.
I took a picture of Lin in front of a mimosa tree.

      <description>Saturday 28 June 1997
(transcribed out of my diary)
 Wende and I are in New Braunfels at her parents&amp;rsquo; house. We went to Schlitterbahn today&amp;ndash;my first time there&amp;ndash;and had a ton of fun. There are 3 separate parks.  I was most technologically impressed with the water coaster. The water pressure accelerated the tube boats up up up so they could slide down then up then down and the key was (of all things) large holes in the bottom of the up ramps which let out the water that was no longer going up so that it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t slow the boat.</description>
