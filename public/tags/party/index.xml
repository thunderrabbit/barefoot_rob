Fun party yesterday!
Interesting group games which I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen before. Two people listen as the remaining people (in two groups) shout in unison two similar words, which the listeners try to understand.
So we on team A shouted COPY while team B shouted COFFEE. The listeners hear &amp;ldquo;KA EE&amp;rdquo; (and try to sort out what the teams were shouting).
Other word pairs: CONVERSATION, CONSERVATION; ELEGANT, ARROGANT; WORK, BOOK (I think; I was on the listening side of that one).</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve seen this truck each time I come to the lessons in Fukuura:

The party was fun; lots of conversation, plus an emcee up front leading some pre-planned competitive games, then a raffle and bingo. People mostly stood around tables covered in drinks, candy, snack foods, tangerines, and some more substantial food, including 焼きそば plus おでん.
Games included a mini version of sumo wrestling, where the participants were butt-to-butt on a chair cushion surrounded by mats.</description>

      <description>7:50AM Morning New Year&#39;s Eve 1991
(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)
We&#39;re here. We got here at about 2AM &amp; we all stayed up for probably 2 hours talking about programming &amp; music and listening to music. Looking out the window, I see the sky is entirely gray. The ocean is about 150 or 200 yards away (wrong 50 yards only) It&#39;s now 11AM or so.
I went to the beach and got some cool shells.</description>
