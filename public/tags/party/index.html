<p>Sweets Party Attendants had their second to last lesson with me
today.  The mood was both somber and joyful; it has been great working
with them over the years.</p>

<p>After the lesson we went to Ozeki, a new restaurant owned by
Sarupapa&rsquo;s friend.  Sarupapa has been working there for a few weeks
now.  Great food and umeshu and dessert!  And of course great company;
so glad everyone gets along so well.</p>

<p>Fun party yesterday!</p>

<p>Interesting group games which I hadn&rsquo;t seen before.  Two people listen
as the remaining people (in two groups) shout in unison two similar
words, which the listeners try to understand.</p>

<p>So we on team A shouted COPY while team B shouted COFFEE.  The
listeners hear &ldquo;KA EE&rdquo; (and try to sort out what the teams were
shouting).</p>

<p>Other word pairs: CONVERSATION, CONSERVATION; ELEGANT, ARROGANT; WORK,
BOOK (I think; I was on the listening side of that one)..</p>

<p>Lots of food: pizza, sandwiches, sushi, cake, plus drinks of a variety
of varieties.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen this truck each time I come to the lessons in Fukuura:</p>

<p><a href="/images/2014/12/Hawaii water 2014-12-10 16.39.32.png"><img src="/images/2014/12/thumbs/Hawaii water 2014-12-10 16.39.32.png" alt="Hawaii Water truck" /></a></p>

<p>##20:26 Wednesday 10 December 2014 JST##</p>

<p>The party was fun; lots of conversation, plus an emcee up front
leading some pre-planned competitive games, then a raffle and
bingo. People mostly stood around tables covered in drinks, candy,
snack foods, tangerines, and some more substantial food,
including 焼きそば plus おでん.</p>

<p>Games included a mini version of sumo wrestling, where the
participants were butt-to-butt on a chair cushion surrounded by mats.
The first person off the cushion lost; it usually took about 0.5
seconds per round! I mentioned to Ashley (the guy for whom I&rsquo;m taking
over classes) that we had a much more balanced game with players
face-to-face, and only allowed to touch with hands.  He said he had
seen a similar game, possibly in Japan.</p>

<p>Another game was a mini drinking competition, but instead of 3 liter
bottles, or gallons of milk, they used 12 (or maybe 16) ounce cola
bottles, and instead of chugging, they sucked it up through silly
straws shaped like glasses (while wearing them).</p>

<p>Ping pong played with non-standard paddles (slippers, pans, bottles,
etc) seemed easy enough, but the winning team only got a volley of 14
hits (whereas one team only got 3!)</p>

<p>For the first 1.5 hours, Ashley and Jessica talked shop (they&rsquo;ve
worked together for a while) and I lurked around them, admiring their
Japanese skizzles. (Man I gotta learn me some Japanese as well.)</p>

<p>Just arrived at 新杉田 so gotta go.</p>

<p>##20:43</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m on the 京浜東北線 now, and there are plennnty of seats!  That&rsquo;s
one really nice thing about this particular class; I can pretty much
sit down all the way both ways.</p>

<p>Hopefully I can snag this class on a permanent basis.  Just gotta tell
JB that I can do it.</p>

<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)</p>

<p>We're here.  We got here at about 2AM & we all stayed up for
probably 2 hours talking about programming & music and listening to
music.  Looking out the window, I see the sky is entirely gray.  The
ocean is about 150 or 200 yards away (wrong 50 yards only)

<p class=date>It's now 11AM or so.</p>

<p><p>I went to the beach and got some cool shells.  I met Danny &amp;
Phyllis, Devin&rsquo;s parents.  They are really cool.  I walked around with
Danny for a while before anyone else was up.  There&rsquo;s a field next
door to the house with cattle in it.  Pretty interesting.  Right now
we&rsquo;re listening to music: <em>Ned&rsquo;s Atomic Dustbin</em>. Cool group
name, eh?</p>
