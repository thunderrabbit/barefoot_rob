      <description>20:22 Thursday 03 May 2018 JST This looks like a bridge from the sidewalk level over here to the roof level over there. Not enough room for an elevator; I am not sure what this might be for.</description>

      <description>16:51 Monday 13 November 2017 JST TL;DR: Would you like donuts delivered to your place on Monday morning Nov 20th? details: Story time! Today I was inexplicably late for class which happens to be near your place. I told them I would get donuts before class next week. I found a donut place, checked Google Maps to see how to get to the class... and the track goes right by your house!</description>
