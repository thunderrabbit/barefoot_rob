      <description>Houston flooded pics!!
9 October 1998
Updated 27 October 1998 with dry pictures Here is the original entry from when Houston flooded. Walking down Montrose toward the intersection with Allen Parkway, we saw this. &#34;Wow; it&#39;s flooded.&#34; Yes, but understand that Allen Parkway goes under that intersection. Here is the normal version. This was taken from the middle of the intersection. I like how the red light reflects on the water.</description>
