      <description>22:03 Wednesday 27 February 2019 JST Today was the 3-weeks-out meeting for we staff of the New Warrior Training Adventure (NWTA) in British Columbia, Canada. It was a good meeting; we each have a buddy and each man on the call checked in for his buddy, with the presumption that the buddies have been in touch with each other.
I was inspired after the call and reached out to my two teams via email.</description>

      <description>Explore the Internet at Breakthrough Speed!
Saturday 28 March 1998
 Yesterday at work I got a new super fast modem for my computer at home. 56k!!!!  My excitement is fake. I currently have an ISDN line that work will no longer pay for. I am slowly being weaned off the internet.. (??)  I&#39;m using ISDN now. We&#39;ll see if installation of this new modem is as easy as the box says.</description>
