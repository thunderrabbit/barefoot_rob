      <description>15:40 Wednesday 27 December 2017 -02 Lin and I ate lunch with R &amp;amp; D and D&amp;rsquo;s auunt R and three of R&amp;rsquo;s nephews. I took the longest to eat due to chewing chewing chewing. The meat was a bit tough given that we arrived near the end of their lunch session. D drove me, Lin and his aunt R in the Range Rover, while R drove his three nephews in a rental car.</description>
