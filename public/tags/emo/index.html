                        <p>So long as I do stuff within a normalized range, no one really cares
what I do.</p>

<p>I can spend all day trying to figure out one bug, or ignore it.  No
one will know the difference.  I could even quit my job, and just a
few people will notice.  (some people very much so, but 99+% will
not)</p>

<p>Re-reading the above sounds like I am suicidal, but I am not.  My
point is quite exactly the opposite.</p>

<p>I can wear shoes or not, and no one cares.  But I care.  I <em>love</em>
being barefoot 99% of the time, and am working toward doing it more.</p>

<p>I can work on Marble Track 3 or not; no one cares.  But I care!  I
<em>love</em> the project; I love talking about it, I love its steady
progress building up to something over time. I love the ridiculousness
of it; I love people&rsquo;s incredulous reactions when I say 1 second of
video took 2 hours to make (and it&rsquo;s going to be a lot higher, tbh..
2 hours per second is just for a <em>silent</em> video!)</p>

<p>I can stop doing workshops and no one cares..  But I care!  I did the
eye gazing workshop and it was great!</p>

<p>For some reason I have had (and still have) this fear that I cannot do
anything <em>different</em> from what I have been doing before, but this is
simply not true!  How untrue is it?</p>

<p>Just this past weekend I did stand a few minutes of up comedy for the
first time (with no prior practice nor planning) and it was fine; it
was easier than I expected.  I could do that, (or not, and no one
cares,) but I don&rsquo;t want to do that.</p>

<p>I want to put together a Silent Football game, though Rin has
recommended I focus on my Barefoot Rob brand first, but I don&rsquo;t wanna!
What should I do?  ergg this is so confusing.</p>

<p>Instead of being frustrated, can I instead see the steading progress
forward like on Marble Track 3?</p>

<p>This is an age-old question, and the answer seems to be it does not
really matter; just do what I want to do!</p>
