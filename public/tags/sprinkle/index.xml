This past weekend after SOGO (only like 12 people attended because it was sprinkling for part of the time) we went to Cookie Time, and oh my god I can imagine how bad it is for me because of how good they taste. I will probably go back next week, esp if Aki comes to SOGO; she also loves sweets.</description>
