                        <ol>
<li><p>I have just removed the ## 06:12 Monday 03 September 2018 JST date
from the top of this journal.  Marking them in h2 tags makes them a
bit too big for this theme.  I hate to modify my source code to fit
a theme, but that happened.</p></li>

<li><p>I recently got the <a href="https://marbletrack3.com">website for Mable Track
3</a> (nearly) up to date.  It now has all
the entries that had been in my journal at
<a href="https://new.robnugen.com/tags/mt3/">https://new.robnugen.com/tags/mt3/</a> and all the entries have an
<code>episode_image</code> in the frontmatter.  Not all the entries have a
<em>unique</em> episode image, but that is another matter.</p></li>

<li><p>The <a href="https://b.robnugen.com/art/marble_track_3/website/2018_sep_02_mt3_placeholder.png">episode image placeholder for Marble Track 3</a> includes the
text &ldquo;All Episodes (8.97 days)&rdquo; which is a new thing I just added
to the site with the help of <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>, Youtube&rsquo;s v3 API (both
of which are Google assets.. hmmm), and
<a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo static website generator</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Just this morning I split the source into two files, one that
actually does the API calls, and one that does all the
logic to create a list of all my Youtube videos in a TOML file.</p></li>

<li><p>Until this very moment, I had decided to <em>not</em> keep a copy of the
TOML file in any of my repos, but now I think I will, for a couple
of reasons.</p>

<ul>
<li>One, so I can show you my
<a href="https://github.com/marbletracks/marbletrack3.com/blob/master/data/playlists/knownvideos.toml">TOML file of all Marble Track 3 videos</a></li>
<li>Two, so the website for Marble Track 3 is easier to recreate
(without installing <del>Go</del> <ins>extra libraries</ins>)</li>
<li>Three, so I can have a <a href="https://github.com/marbletracks/marbletrack3.com/commit/16c9e0acfbebcccf8de83e94ae738e61efdc1f47">history of the file</a>, which currently is <em>not</em> sorted by Publish Date, though I would like it to be
because that would make it easier to figure out what to name the
livestreams that did not get unique names.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>I have just linked git commits both directions from Marble Track 3
source to my journal entries, and from my journal entries to Marble
Track 3 source.  Which ones will break first?</p></li>

<li><p>I am halfway through Anikiko&rsquo;s Shift Your Shit program, subtitled
Own and Sell Your Gifts, or something.  It has been great, giving
me several good ideas, which I am beginning to implement.  Oh, that
reminds me, I need to write to John Gaughan, re: volunteer burnout</p></li>

<li><p>I am using a water Android phone from a couple years ago, an Aquos
something something.  I am using my Macbook from more than a couple
years ago, perhaps 5 years (therefore 50 laptop-years).  I got a
new backpack with wheels and a hard plastic cover for my computer.</p></li>

<li><p>I have not been wearing shoes in Tokyo for 8 years now.  That is 1
year more than I was barefoot in Houston.  That&rsquo;s a strange thought
for me.</p></li>

<li><p>Lin and I still do not have kids, but we have our cat Jennie, who
is maybe 5 years old.  6?  Lin still likes to keep Jennie inside
at night, even though Jennie climbs around on Lin&rsquo;s head at night,
meowing (to be let outside, I think).</p></li>

<li><p>I have started taking walks in the morning, though I did not walk
the past couple of days.  Tomorrow I will walk for sure!  I walk
for about an hour, trying to find a new street or new area I have
not previously seen.  This search has turned up a pizza place, a
hidden grave yard, a brick fish tank, and a nice path along the
nearby recycling center.</p></li>

<li><p>I have started eating less, and for shorter durations during the
day.  Lin is interested in doing similarly as a <em>concept</em>, but not
always interested in doing it in <em>practice</em>.  I have been hearing
more and more about intermittant fasting and its benefits.  Most
recently, I heard that it&rsquo;s good to eat only during a 10 hour
window each day.  I am not quite there yet, but close.</p></li>

<li><p>I am headed to Akabanebashi now for IL lesson.  Then walk to Nishi
Azabu for UG lesson featuring Akari, Emi, Kazu, Kenji, Masa,
Ryuya, Shinji, and Taka (in ABC order).</p></li>

<li><p>It looks like co-gender group will not happen tonight.</p></li>

<li><p>Just arrived in Shinjuku.  Changing trains now.</p></li>

<li><p>Oh, that reminds me, I have been keeping track of my finances,
down to the yen, since July of this year.</p></li>

<p>Been working on my taxes for 2017.  I filed them on time, but did not
provide any list of expenses.  Now they are like &ldquo;yeah you owe $2000.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have compiled a list of expenses based on the train stations I had
to use to get to the various lessons.  Hopefully that will be enough.</p>

<p>I have been keeping better track of my expenses in 2018.</p>

<p>Last night we discussed presenting a day-long workshop to men in Tokyo.  My vision is to expand the work to new men around Tokyo and eventually Japan.  I am looking for 2 or 3 men to help me present the workshop in October or November this year.  I hope to meet with whoever steps up and create a plan by early August.</p>

<p>Today Tomoko seemed quite entertained with the magnitude of Marble
Track 3&rsquo;s Construction.  It worked well to show her
<a href="https://mt2.robnugen.com/">Marble Track 2</a> because she soon asked how
I made it.</p>

<p>Nowadays at JB, I teach 5 lessons on Wednesdays, 20% more than the
past year of lessons.</p>

<p>I think I finished adding ARC Cycles to CSV reports for AB.  I mean I
finished, and I think they are what AB wanted.</p>

<p>I think my passport expires soon; I gotta get that sorted.  Because no
one checks my passport unless I leave the country, I figured I can let
it be expired for a while, but now I realize that may not be a good
idea.</p>

<p>Our 6pm students seem to be late.  It&rsquo;s after 5:59 now.  Not late!  16
seconds to spare.</p>

<p>Been working too much recently, but not enough to trigger carpal
tunnel issues again, fortunately.</p>

<p>Today for AB I nearly finished a report that AB wants to have
available.  I thought I could finish in 2 hours, but it has taken 6.5
so far.  fack.  I will tell them it has taken longer.</p>

<p>Today for JB I did my normal Wednesday schedule (Solid Square with
Ayano and them, then two kid lessons and two adult lessons in JB
office from 15:30 - 21:00).  Had a gap in the middle so went to Muza
for their ワンコイン 500 yen lunchtime concert.  Had a nice snooze
during the performance, a string quartet, which played for about 40
minutes.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t remember what Mel suggested about this title besides use the
correct kanji for 僕</p>

<p>I just finished work and cannot quite bear to think in Japanese.</p>

<ol>
<li>I am training to work at Ty&rsquo;s (headed there now)</li>
<li>I have been transferring the CB backend to SB, where it will be
streamlined / focused on artists and their events instead of
artists and their products.</li>
<li>It has been over a year since I first considered giving up this
laptop for one on which I can run Ubuntu.</li>
<li>The only thing I don&rsquo;t like about this laptop now is the lack of
battery.</li>
<li>I meditated standing up this morning and last night.  By standing,
I was able to remain awake.</li>
<li>I just noticed the funny looking panel (featuring a guy in a yellow
suit) on the train has expanded to
two panels.  I guess it is some kinda campaign.</li>
<li>I have started taking Japanese lessons with Mel who&rsquo;s a native
Japanese speaker who&rsquo;s been willing to look at my homework between
lessons, and whose English is pretty darn good, being that she
lives in the US (and apparently tried hard to learn).</li>
<li>I have gotten positive feedback regarding being a good listener.</li>
<li>I have started doing counseling in my free time before teaching in
西麻布（にしあざぶ）</li>
<li>Lin has been out of town for two nights to see Mikako in 新潟.  I
was planning to go but prep for Ty and sb kept me here.</li>
<li>The owner of Christine&rsquo;s apartment has offered to replace the
carpet with flooring due to some kind of issue they were having
with it.</li>
<li>I used an old envelope I had had with an alpaca / llama sticker on
it to repay people who helped me the day I left my wallet at home.</li>
<li>I have been guiding my thinking with the underlying trust in the
idea &ldquo;the spirit world is real,&rdquo; which I have been hearing more
and more from people I have (casually) interviewed about their
ayajuasca experiences.</li>
<li>I will be taking a course with Soness soon.  She will help me
clarify my message regarding men&rsquo;s group work and personal growth
work in general.</li>
<li>I just learned the first names of けいこさん and さっちゃん
(short for さちこさん), two women who work in a news/snack stand
in the middle of a platform.  They had asked me last week about
being barefoot, and apparently didn&rsquo;t recognized me this week
until they noticed my bare feet.</li>
<li>I just heard a little 4 year old boy refer to himself using 俺（お
れ）, which I still don&rsquo;t use because I think my Japanese isn&rsquo;t
good enough.</li>
<li>日本語を書けますけど、今度これを読めますか？</li>
<li>I am beginning to try reading Japanese paragraphs, but the kanji
still gets me.  I probably can read 200 or so kanji and write 100
or so kanji.</li>
<li>I want to work on open source projects instead of all closed
source stuff.  Welll to be more clear, I want to work on more open
source projects for which I&rsquo;m the maintainer.  I have contributed
to some open source projects, but &hellip; Wait. even as I write this, I
realize I am misrepresenting the situation. I want to be able to
post code / ask questions without having to ask / cleanse the code
first.</li>
<li>Marble Track 3 is pretty open source, but it&rsquo;s hardware, and one
of a kind that will be pretty hard to duplicate.  I did not put a
password on the images, but have not yet figured out how (to
explain how) people can download the images.</li>
<li>Marble Track 3 has entered its fifth month of development (not
including making the cage/barrier to keep Jennie out). I think I
have worked 4.8 days on it, according to the livestreams I have on Youtube.</li>
<li>Just left Noborito.  Gonna change trains at the next station.
Peace out and see ya later, computer.</li>

<p>This past Sunday, Lin and I went to the end of the Keikyu line, then
took a bus to Jogashima, which had sedimentary rocks tilted at about
an 80 degree angle in some places.</p>

<p>It was great fun, and worth its own entry!</p>

<hr />

<p>This past Saturday, Mikako joined us to watch Jurassic World in IMAX
3D.  It was okay, but I thought the third movie was better.</p>

<p>(( how in the world can I say meh to such a huge project?! ))</p>

<hr />

<p>Been working on PopPopChaos as well, and hopefully hopefully hopefully
will get it working the way I want.</p>

<hr />

<p>I haven&rsquo;t drawn mazes in 2 weeks, and am on track to miss today as
well.  Sigh.</p>

<hr />

<p>Met T from AB and have specs for new parts of the site.  Good stuff!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve started collecting nanobitcoins on freebitco.in.  My referral

<p>A couple days ago I started tracking my caloric intake with My Fitness
Pal after a doctor told me I&rsquo;m overweight.  Shocking!!</p>

<p>Wow first entry in March.  I wonder why, but it seems I often miss the first day(s) of months.</p>

<p>Worked on stuff for Nate yesterday on new redmine installation, makin&rsquo;
it all customized and nearly getting emails working.  The server can
send them from command line, and Redmine says its email is set up, but
maybe it doesn&rsquo;t check past &ldquo;is there a configuration file&rdquo; (i.e. I
set it up rhong)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been studying a bit of Japanese (kanji) with the app
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/japanese/id290664053?mt=8">Japanese</a>.</p>
