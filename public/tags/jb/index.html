<p>Today Naoko worked on introducing the history zone, including teacup
carrying dolls, perpetual clock, and the early days of electricity in
Japan.</p>

<p>What was it like back in the day when a simple thing like a few candle
power light bulb could be so impressive?</p>

<p>Yasu talked about the Meissner effect and flux pinning.  I would like
to do an experiment..  will the Meissner effect keep a thing suspended
above the magnetic table or is that only do to flux pinning?</p>

<p>Liliko confirmed some changes to some quiz questions for a new exhibit
that will be an audio recognition quiz.</p>

<p>JB got me 8 hours of lessons at BP over the 4 Thursdays in June.  This
was the 3rd lesson, during which we practiced taking taxis, ordering
in a restaurant, and something else.</p>

<p>Yoko M wasn&rsquo;t there, but she will be back next week.  Yoko N
volunteered a couple of times to go first!</p>

<p>Back at SCC today with four student for 30 minutes each.  Hitomi came
in for Lily, who could not come.</p>

<p>I bought
<a href="https://hanayama-toys.com/product/cast-arrows/">Cast Arrows</a>, a new
Hanayama puzzle because I could not solve it in 20 minutes.  (not that
I can solve most of them in 20 minutes, but this one <em>looked</em> like I
could solve it and then I was like &ldquo;woah that&rsquo;s not going to work???&rdquo;
because one piece was jjuustt slightly too big to fit through a gap.
Dang, I thought they were all the same size.</p>

<p>I am on the way home after my last 2018 lesson at JB.  I thought we
had lessons next week, but apparently not!  I kinda sorta wish we did
have to work next week; the monies would be nice, but I guess I can
work on AB during that time.</p>

<p>I worked for JB at three different locations around Kawasaki Station
today, as I do every Wednesday, at Solid Square, SSC, and JB main
office.  Solid Square lesson went pretty well; we drew mind maps of
our favorite places and then said a few sentences about them.  Then I
had a break during which I Marco Poloed with Richard from ae911truth a
bit and then worked on AB, nearly finishing this ticket since it
received a bit higher priority at our last meeting.</p>

<p>SSC featured lunch with Tomoko and then she reminded me of M&rsquo;s
birthday yesterday and bought a present &ldquo;from me&rdquo; which I wrapped.
Then lesson with Tomoko and head out to JB (via bus cause it&rsquo;s kinda
raining) and I spent some time working on AB and nearly nearly got the
ticket finished.</p>

<p>Four JB lessons each Wednesday: two lessons with kids and then two
with adults.  New student in the kids lessons is pretty genki, and may
have a good effect on the others.  We had them write some letters N+1
times and then practiced language &ldquo;I have a _____&rdquo; using different
plastic fruit.  We had tried &ldquo;I have a _____&rdquo; and &ldquo;I want a _____&rdquo; but
they kept getting &ldquo;have&rdquo; and &ldquo;want&rdquo; mixed up, so I switched it to only
&ldquo;have&rdquo; because I remember not being able to distinguish the words for
library and post office for a long time because I had learned them on
the same day.</p>

<p>In second class I used the same fruit to lay out a fake city, hoping
they would enjoy giving directions with fruit as landmarks.  It did
not work as well as I hoped; they prefered playing various sports with
the plastic fruits (which I can understand, but was frustrating for a
bit).  They finally got into it a little bit, but then <em>really</em> got
interested with Kazu brought in his computer with an animated game
version of giving directions.</p>

<p>In the third class, we used past perfect(?) e.g. &ldquo;I have worked in _____
for ____&rdquo; and &ldquo;I have lived in _____&rdquo; because the language pattern
came up in their banter at the beginning of classes.</p>

<p>In the fourth class, they were not saying much, and I was getting
tired, so I invited them to tell me their favorite fairy tale in
Japanese.  They told me the story of Peach Boy.  Their version seemed
to be missing a lot of possible sub-plots; I wonder how it was
originally written.</p>

<h2 id="21-51-wednesday-06-june-2018-jst">21:51 Wednesday 06 June 2018 JST</h2>

<p>I have been writing this on the train from Yako to Tsudayama, and am
feeling super tired.</p>

<p>If I had my way, I would be magically transported home from here.
Thank god for Lin who usually picks me up from our station on
Wednesdays.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m on break now at JB, listening to the other class, where the
teacher&rsquo;s Japanesey English always kinda bugs me.  But the students
seem happy and have been in the class for a long time.</p>

<p>This morning thinking about C who apparently took my investment advice
before bitcoin blew up.  She quit her job and is overseas now.
hahahah nice!</p>

<p>Then working on AB, getting three alleged issues sorted.  Only one was
actually valid, but we had a chat on the phone and got them sorted.  I
fixed the one issue and then explained it to Kai who happened to come
by on her way to work.</p>

<p>Hi Kai!</p>

<p>Then went to SCC and talked to Tomoko and Midori for an hour each, not
counting lunch with Tomoko (Midori and Yuko chose not to join).</p>

<p>Zoom here to JB and two kids classes, the first of which went by
easily thanks to Patrick&rsquo;s (neverending) Day of Week game, and the
second of which went easily due to my shopping game.</p>

<p>Was barefoot between Sh and SCC.  Socks now, but will be barefoot on
the way home tonight.</p>

<p>This is the fourth to last lesson at BRIDGE.  They started off strong,
but then started to get busy quite quickly last summer.  Two hours of
lessons went down to 1 hour which sucked considering it took 3 hours
round trip travel.  But I kept at it.  During December they cancelled
January saying they will be too busy.  So I had a nice break during
January, during which they said the will end at the end of February.</p>

<p>Three hours of lessons in SCC today; looking forward to it!</p>

<p>On the way there, I hope to figure out why my local version of
mypowercircle.org will not compile with Hugo.  bah.  it was supposed
to be easy!!</p>

<p>Ah. I had gotten stuck trying to add Japanese language version of the
site, but never got it working.  It&rsquo;s better to just have an actual
Japanese speaker make the Japanese site, so I cut out the Japanese
content from the site and now it&rsquo;s working again.</p>

Mizuho, Liliko, and Tomoe.</p>
