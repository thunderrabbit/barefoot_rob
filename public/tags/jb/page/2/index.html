<p>First three classes were fine today, though I have been asked to blow
through a book super fast to let one class catch up with another
class.  I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s how it works.</p>

<p>In other news, JB has a new owner, who seems nice enough that I can
keep working here.  Really curious as to how much they paid!</p>

<p>I worked for four companies yesterday.  First was my lesson in
Akabanebashi for Tariq.  Then walked to Nishi Azabu for MR
Laboratories client (company DNE yet).  Then walked across the Nishi
Azabu intersection to a lesson for TESS.  Then bus and train to
Kawasaki for 2 hours of lessons at my favorite, SCC.  Came home and
had one more lesson for MR Laboratories.</p>

<p>Today was the first time I worked five hours at SCC.  Due to a
schedule snafu, 1.5 hours with Liliko chatting about her trip to
Sydney and my trip to OZ, then Rick and Morty and Lucifer.  I didn&rsquo;t
think of Dirk Gently, but she considered getting Netflix to see the
others.</p>

<p>Now I am in Akihabara, across the street from GG lesson which starts
at 18:30.</p>

<p>I bought a trackball mouse to replace the one I had before which seems
to just mysteriously and annoyingly not work anymore.  This time I
will keep the receipt because I think the old one konked out before
its warranty was up.</p>

<p>Today was the first of five 2-hour lessons this month at SCC.  Today I
helped Tomoko by making corrections to her written English.  She plans
to present the features of some of her company&rsquo;s products.  Pretty
cool stuff like elevators and batteries, and elevators that run on
batteries.  We studied up in their cafeteria on the 4th floor, and
then I went down the escalator to the third floor and went out the
exit I had never gone out before (but had seen many times).  Neat!</p>

<p>I discovered their wide screen TV wall is run via HDMI.</p>

<p>The kids lessons were pretty good today.  The two new students (one in
each of my first two classes) are still not speaking, and I can&rsquo;t tell
if they are acting shy or don&rsquo;t understand..  anytime they speak, they
get the right answer, but getting them to speak is a stretch.  esp
with the other kids being so chatty.  I ain&rsquo;t sure how to handle it.</p>

<p>Actually I don&rsquo;t know if she&rsquo;ll be here, but one of my former students
at Nova contacted me on FB saying that she&rsquo;s in the Tuesday version of
my Thursday class with GG.  Well, I&rsquo;m teaching the Tuesday lesson
today at 12, so I may see her soon!  I don&rsquo;t honestly remember her
just from FB photo, but we&rsquo;ll see if some memories return after
actually chatting with her.</p>

<h2 id="13-09">13:09</h2>

<p>She didn&rsquo;t join.  :-(</p>

<p>But we had a fun lesson!  Basically asked and answered a few
questions, while correcting grammar and such.</p>

<p>Chapter with Chika, Ayano, and Yohei runs from 7:50 to 8:50.  Maybe
it&rsquo;s a bit early; the first to arrive today (besides me, running a
little late and arriving at 8:50:30) arrived at 8:05.</p>

<p>Everyone presented trip reports and we&rsquo;ll get back to the book next
