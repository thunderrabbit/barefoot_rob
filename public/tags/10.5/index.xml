      <description>04:54 Sunday 31 December 2017 -02 Ten point five hours to go in our flight. It&amp;rsquo;s 5am Sao Paulo time, and 4pm Tokyo time. I took a 3.5 hour nap in Sao Paulo and woke up around 8:45pm (and wrote a journal entry about a dream I had writing a journal entry about a dream I had) and have thereby been awake 8 hours. I plan to be awake 6 more hours, at which point I will have 4 more hours of flight time to sleep before we arrive in Dubai.</description>
