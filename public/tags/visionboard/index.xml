      <description>21:15 Sunday 09 June 2019 JST Six people in the visionboard workshop tonight. Great teaching points for me because Rin said the day before that I was the only one who expressed interest in attending. The next day three more chose to come, so it was Hiro, Rin, me, then three others, who were perfectly balanced for each other and us. Similar backstories, blessings for me to learn, etc.</description>
