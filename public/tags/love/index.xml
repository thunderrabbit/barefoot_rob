      <description>16:11 Sunday 14 April 2019 JST Told RG my life story and he said he could hear my head, but not hear my heart. I said something something something and then he was like &amp;ldquo;[that] will happen when you begin to love yourself&amp;rdquo;
And I just started to cry. I do not love myself. I love a lot of the things I do, but apparently not the me who I am.</description>

 take care of your mother figure it out you are alone you&amp;rsquo;re a little man  Felt vibrations in my body which come up when I do deep work. Vibration and tingling in legs stomach arms face lips.
Trust fall was so spooky, hard not to self-facilitate. Josh took all the stuff I have been carrying on my shoulders.</description>
