Hopefully and presumably she will be okay!</description>

      <description>09:46 Friday 09 December 2016 JST I just went to a dermetologist near our station to ask about a weird pimple thing on my arm, cracks in the callouses on my feet, and itchy face. I was rewarded with a prescription for four types of cream / ointment.</description>
