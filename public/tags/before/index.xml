      <description>13:46 Tuesday 05 December 2017 JST I worked on MT3 in two parts today. Right around 2 hours total, I think, not including letting glue dry (during which I ate lunch and had a nice nap). I found a pretty good technique for keeping the large marble in place: using a twist tie looped around the track seems to do the trick. If I had taken the time to figure that out before I had the guy push the big marble up the M Splitter, he would have been able to walk up on both rails.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m on the train headed to Soness&amp;rsquo;s house in Chigaski. She&amp;rsquo;s going to help me with ideas for teaching kids class on Wednesdays, and I&amp;rsquo;m going to help her with computer stuff. And we&amp;rsquo;ll get to catch up on life and hugs!</description>
