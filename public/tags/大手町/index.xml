      <description>21:34 Friday 27 April 2018 JST Jon and I ate burgers after we did a bit of a code review and MySQL discussion. Short answer: it&amp;rsquo;s better to loop through via code than do group+sort+filter+etc in MySQL.
After discussion, he showed me a lovely bridge across a river. It connects a building to a parking area with 15 bicycle parking spots on the far side of a river. 15 bicycle parking spots is a joke compared to the size of the building, and even the bridge itself, which features glass elevators on each side.</description>
