<p>Today I met a woman who asked if I was from New Zealand.  We were in a
clinic for meds; Lin and I are sick; the woman had hives.  She said
she had just started studying English, but I didn&rsquo;t think quickly
enough to see if she&rsquo;d like to take lessons with me.</p>

<p>Been sick as a dog for most of it, but I have had a great time hanging
out at Michael Monkey&rsquo;s in Houston.  Thanks to Great Granny Good Witch
for driving me to the store today to buy clothes and toiletries which
should last a good while.</p>

<p>She has a lot lot lotta masks from around the world!</p>

<p>I have made a good start on the puzzle in the dining room, first
expanding the table, then adding more white backing, then rotating the
inner white backing to reduce waste.</p>

<p>Enjoyed chicken soup, fried chicken, orange gatorade, orange juice,
and chocolate.</p>

<p>Got a sense of what it would be like to have US political news on all
the time, and am glad I do not have that option in Japan.  Brain
overload!</p>

<p>I felt sad to have to check out for a significant portion of the NWTA
this past weekend.  So annoying, and certainly not what I had in mind
for my trip!</p>

<p>Was great to meet awesome men.  I stayed with Steve R in Vancouver the
night before the weekend, and am now staying with Dave M in Victoria
the night after the weekend.  Headed to Houston tomorrow via Calgary.</p>

<p>Hopefully will get to see Marty and M and M twins in Houston!</p>

<p>Lin drove me to a clinic today because I got some kinda cold, and have
been coughing for a while.  Doc said it isn&rsquo;t contageous, but gave me
four (4) different meds to take 3 times a day for 5 days.</p>

<p>I woke up feeling a bit sick and Lin drove me to the clinic for fever,
nausea, headache, etc.  They stuck the long stick in my sinus to test
for influenza.  It was negative, but they said it because it&rsquo;s only
been a day, it might just not be influenzy enough for the test to
detect it.</p>

<p>blah</p>

<p>this is day 6 of Influenza B, which started on Monday officially.  A
couple days ago on Thursday the doctor predicted I&rsquo;d be able to work
on Tuesday, and even didn&rsquo;t give me any more medication.  Yay, but now
booo because I can&rsquo;t tell that I&rsquo;m realllllly getting better.</p>

<p>My voice isn&rsquo;t fully back, but it isss better a bit, but I&rsquo;ve had no
voice for like 3 or 4 days now.  blah.</p>

<p>Kevin has asked if I can help with his site, and I&rsquo;m like man I wish.
dang.  My brain is just like sidetracked and hard to focus.</p>

<p>yeah wow this is my first entry in a while; I&rsquo;ve had influenza (type
B, not that I think I&rsquo;d know the difference) and it&rsquo;s taken my voice
somewhere for going on 40 hours now.  I&rsquo;m barely beginning to get it
back; there seems to be one pitch that works but the rest are just
raspy air.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to the clinic today, but I can&rsquo;t speak!  hmmm</p>

<p>I printed this note for the doctor:</p>

<pre><code>Today I feel about 80% of my energy back

My bowels are better, and I can eat

but I cannot speak!  It's been 44 hours that I cannot speak

I still cough a little bit, but my lungs are mostly clear
</code></pre>

<h2 id="10-51am">10:51am</h2>

<p>Dr didn&rsquo;t give me any more meds; he predicted I&rsquo;ll be able to work
again on Tuesday.  Wow.</p>

<p>Total charge: 380 yen ($3.80)</p>

<p>I asked for a note indicating that I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to work, and got a
sealed envelope for 2700 yen ($27).</p>

<p>Bluh I&rsquo;m sick today, and took the day off from CB and Saru work.</p>

<p>Went to a local clinic and got some meds; was feeling better during
the day after sleeping, and then started &ldquo;working&rdquo; on AB site.</p>

<p>Streamed my socked feet online, but no one joined the fun.</p>

<p>Kinda got back into the Ghost Inspector AB groove, but not totally
sure why some tests are not passing while others are.</p>
