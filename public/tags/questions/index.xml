      <description>Catching Up
Thursday 10 September 1998
Yes, I haven&#39;t written in a while. Sigh.. Sometimes I feel so bogged down and I have so much fun stuff to write!! Tulsa Rally was last weekend, dinner at Niko Niko&#39;s was last night, and I&#39;ve had lots of anti-fun with my scanner not working! But I&#39;m here on campus at UH again; just ate lunch and said HI to Nikki and Sara and am about to go to Scholars&#39; Community where I used to work on campus.</description>
