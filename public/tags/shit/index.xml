      <description>21:51 Friday 24 August 2018 JST I took the course tonight with my ex-crush new-coach Anikiko. She created the course 7 (seven) days ago and it started tonight. It will run for 3 weeks and I actually think I will invite some people to join.
If you have a budding project ready to jump out of you, I judge this program will get you moving.
It has already gotten me moving through just the first hour.</description>

      <description>11:34 Sunday 24 January 2016 PST We were scheduled to be at the wedding location at 10am to help set up centerpieces. I was up and ostensibly ready-within-5-minutes as Fred repeatedly snoozed his alarm around 9 am.
He was like, &amp;ldquo;they won&amp;rsquo;t be ready by 10am; arriving anytime between 10 and 11 is fine.&amp;rdquo;
We arrived around 11:15.
All the centerpieces were done so we left.
Had I realllly cared to be there on time, I could have found another driver.</description>
