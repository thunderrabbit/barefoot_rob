      <description>11:01 Thursday 14 December 2017 JST Jennie went to the doctor today who said her paw had recovered enough to let her go outside. So great! I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to have to keep her inside for a week or whatever it was before. She&amp;rsquo;s quite persistent in explaining where she&amp;rsquo;d rather be!</description>

      <description>13:59 Tuesday 12 December 2017 JST Giving Jennie some cuddles today, I noticed an extra pad on her foot. Hmmm. That&amp;rsquo;s not a pad, that&amp;rsquo;s a swollen something something. fortunately Lin still had time to take her to the clinic; I am headed to work now. Hopefully and presumably she will be okay!</description>
