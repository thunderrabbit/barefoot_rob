      <description>06:32 Thursday 30 August 2018 JST I heard some water trickling and noticed a fountain flowing into a basin made of bricks. There were a couple fish inside, effectively making it a brick fishtank.

The sky was overcast so not too hot.
Oh, today was the day I walked across part of the dirt lot and up into the back corner area. I didn&amp;rsquo;t think to take pics while on the inside, but I might go again.</description>

      <description>22:47 Wednesday 11 October 2017 JST I am at a hospital with Lin after a little fender bender involving a guy&amp;rsquo;s shoulder hitting her mirror hard enough to cut her hand as the glass shattered into her open window.
The police officer came and suggested it will be easiest/cheapest overall if they don&amp;rsquo;t sue each other and just do 50&amp;frasl;50 blame and call it in to their respective insurance companies.</description>
