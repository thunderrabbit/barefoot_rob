      <description>17:16 Tuesday 12 December 2017 JST I may be speaking too soon, but programming in Godot is so easy I could just cry. (in terms of memory managment, auto completion, and things just working)</description>

      <description>20:28 Thursday 04 August 2016 JST Though we almost got sidetracked with describing days relative to today, I think our lesson on &amp;ldquo;a&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;the&amp;rdquo; went quite well. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t taught this lesson in a while. I remember I used to have a cache of plastic fat horse characters of a variety of colors and a few different sizes. They were perfect for the &amp;ldquo;a - the&amp;rdquo; game.
Mayumi created some cards with crayons on them with different colors and different lengths.</description>

      <description>18:12 Tuesday 19 January 2016 JST At the toy store today, Mai asked if I had solved the circular quadruple maze thing. I have not. But I assured her if I received it as a gift, I would be able to solve it. (I have a plan for how to solve it, but it involves (temporarily) placing marks (removable stickers) on the surfaces of the mazes.)
She said she would give it to me for 65,000 yen.</description>

      <description>08:43 Tuesday 01 December 2015 JST  #!/bin/bash cd ~/journal-hugo-local open http://localhost:1313/ echo &amp;quot;building&amp;quot; hugo server --watch  The browser is opened using the open command and shows a failure for a few seconds until I reload it after Hugo builds the site at lightning speed. After that, any changes I make a quickly refelcted on the localhost webpage.
Hmm but I can&amp;rsquo;t yet see my images locally
15:00 Wednesday 02 December 2015 JST Thanks to Travis for pointing out that I don&amp;rsquo;t need to cd ~ back to my original directory when running (most) shell scripts!</description>

      <description>17:53 Thursday 29 October 2015 JST Sweet. $149 per year, but it&amp;rsquo;s encrypted before leaving my computer, and it&amp;rsquo;s unlimted.
But, I sent them an email, basically &amp;ldquo;yo, yo&amp;rsquo; shit keep crashin&amp;rsquo;,&amp;rdquo; which I hope/expect is a temporary issue.</description>

Went to chill at Nate&amp;rsquo;s, and the nearby convenience store very conveniently had my favorite ice cream bars for sale! Woooo white chocolate center with vanilla ice cream and white chocolate coating.</description>
