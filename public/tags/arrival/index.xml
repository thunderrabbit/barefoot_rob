      <description>Con Con arrival
11pm Monday 3 August 1998

transcribed from my diary
Arrived at the airport from Phoenix after 1 hour flight during which I slept most of the way. I woke at the end to see Ian F (I like the pun &#34;E &#39;n F&#34;) who I met at GA and his sister Kathleen. Bryan Beck said HI while we were waiting for baggage and then we sat with the pile of youth after collecting Ian and Kathleen&#39;s stuff.</description>
