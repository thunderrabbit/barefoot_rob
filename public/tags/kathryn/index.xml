4pm Tuesday 4 August 1998

Lunch then chilled and we had a fire drill, bringing everyone to the volley ball court downhill from all the cabins.

Then I arrived late for the adult check-in meeting but it was all good and afterward I said HI and talked to Kathryn, advisor from this area.</description>
