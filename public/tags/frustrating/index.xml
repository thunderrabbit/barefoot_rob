      <description>07:18 Friday 15 September 2017 JST Ugh. I previously uploaded version 2.2.1 of an iOS app. This time I uploaded 2.2.3 and the reply was &amp;ldquo;Oh you already uploaded version 2.2.3&amp;rdquo;
Fine ffs so I boosted the version to 2.2.4 and uploaded it.
Now they say the version number must be higher than 2.21.
I never uploaded 2.21!!111 I uploaded 2.2.1. WTF kinda checks are they doing? This is sofa king annoying.</description>
