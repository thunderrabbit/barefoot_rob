<p>Lin and I are headed to her sister&rsquo;s for some family thing.  Dinner
and brownies (with coconut yuck).  I forgot to bring any puzzles for
the kids to play with.</p>

<p>Oh, speaking of puzzles, I gave/loaned to Atsuko the kinda-easy
star-shaped ring puzzle that I bought in Brazil.</p>

<p>Been a pretty good day today despite the 6-year-old driving me a bit
crazy.  He seems to be a bit entitled and petulant, but maybe that is
my projection.  We played with the vertical labyrinth game, kids
blocks marble track, jenga, and tried to play pictionary, but his
version of the game was to write the words instead of draw them.  Make
sense!</p>

<p>Niece, nephews, and I watched <em>17 Again</em> which was better than I might
have expected.</p>

<p>Walked to the convenience store with nephews to get ice cream.  They
did well navigating back through the twists and turns.</p>

<p>Just found out that Charlie died yesterday.  Don&rsquo;t have details
(intentional / accidental).  I called Dad, but immediately went to
voice mail. I guess he is talking to them already.</p>

<p>Great to have a-san-su and a-san-su-mei staying with us for a couple
of days!  I met them around the time Lin and I got married, so it&rsquo;s
been a few years since we&rsquo;ve seen them!  Lin&rsquo;s sisters and kids came
over last night for big dinner and lots of laughter.  Middle sister
and I did cheers a couple times with red wine and limone,
respectively.  I tried to find an ordering around the table that would
have a smooth transition between languages spoken.  Couldn&rsquo;t solve it
even with just 3 languages involved.</p>

<p>The kids played with the French vertical labyrinth kinda game, and did
pretty well.  The youngest was the most willing to play.  Middle kid
just watched TV and the oldest focused on social media via cellphone.
We all focused on brownies and ice cream at the end of the evening.
So decadent!</p>

<p>Sisters and kids left around 10pm and then we pretty much headed to
sleep.</p>

<p>This morning I showed aunt and uncle Marble Track 3 so far (finished
first four clips (5 minutes 28 seconds (~3936 frames)))</p>

<p>Now headed to TY.</p>

<p>Had a family outing with Joanna and Eric from San Francisco, who are
in town for a week.  I hadn&rsquo;t met Eric, but I had met Joanna briefly 4
years ago when Lin and I stayed at her family home (out of which she
had already moved) when we got married in the US.</p>

<p>I got to sit next to Eric at Its Vegetable (or is it It&rsquo;s Vegetable)
near Kinshicho(?) last night.  He&rsquo;s great at asking questions!  I need
to learn how to do that more naturally.  Best I could really do was
&ldquo;how about you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He works at Google (jelly) and asked what cloud provider I use.  I
told him basically AWS, so we talked about that for a bit.</p>

<p>On my right were Takumi, Yuu at the head of the table, and Mikarin
across the table from me.  I showed them the two puzzles from Mayumi
which I had solved.  I was able to solve the butterfly one, but
interestingly couldn&rsquo;t get the horseshoe one solved, though I claimed
it was the easier of the two.</p>

<p>Lin and I &ldquo;babysat&rdquo; for her sister&rsquo;s daughter Mikako, nicknamed Mikarin. We played memory with a full deck of cards and each won once. We played Othello twice (Mikako beat me, then I beat Lin). Lin took a nap; we all ate cake.</p>

<p>Then when Baba got back to the house, we ate at the smokey restaurant and then Lin and I went home.</p>
