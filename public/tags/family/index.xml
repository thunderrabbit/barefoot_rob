      <description>12:54 Saturday 03 November 2018 JST Lin and I are headed to her sister&amp;rsquo;s for some family thing. Dinner and brownies (with coconut yuck). I forgot to bring any puzzles for the kids to play with.
Oh, speaking of puzzles, I gave/loaned to Atsuko the kinda-easy star-shaped ring puzzle that I bought in Brazil.
18:05 Saturday 03 November 2018 JST Now going to see if we can play Minecraft with the kids.</description>

      <description>22:13 Sunday 23 September 2018 JST Been a pretty good day today despite the 6-year-old driving me a bit crazy. He seems to be a bit entitled and petulant, but maybe that is my projection. We played with the vertical labyrinth game, kids blocks marble track, jenga, and tried to play pictionary, but his version of the game was to write the words instead of draw them. Make sense!</description>

      <description>06:12 Monday 20 November 2017 JST Just found out that Charlie died yesterday. Don&amp;rsquo;t have details (intentional / accidental). I called Dad, but immediately went to voice mail. I guess he is talking to them already.
20:55 Wednesday 29 November 2017 JST I misunderstood. It was Shane, not Charlie.</description>

      <description>08:46 Sunday 15 October 2017 JST Great to have a-san-su and a-san-su-mei staying with us for a couple of days! I met them around the time Lin and I got married, so it&amp;rsquo;s been a few years since we&amp;rsquo;ve seen them! Lin&amp;rsquo;s sisters and kids came over last night for big dinner and lots of laughter. Middle sister and I did cheers a couple times with red wine and limone, respectively.</description>

      <description>09:56 Sunday 10 January 2016 JST Had a family outing with Joanna and Eric from San Francisco, who are in town for a week. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t met Eric, but I had met Joanna briefly 4 years ago when Lin and I stayed at her family home (out of which she had already moved) when we got married in the US.
I got to sit next to Eric at Its Vegetable (or is it It&amp;rsquo;s Vegetable) near Kinshicho(?</description>

Lin and I &amp;ldquo;babysat&amp;rdquo; for her sister&amp;rsquo;s daughter Mikako, nicknamed Mikarin. We played memory with a full deck of cards and each won once. We played Othello twice (Mikako beat me, then I beat Lin). Lin took a nap; we all ate cake.
Then when Baba got back to the house, we ate at the smokey restaurant and then Lin and I went home.</description>

      <description>##22:55 Sunday 30 December 2012
No pics yet but they might be on my mom&amp;rsquo;s FB wall already.
Ma, Mama, Lin, Fred, and I shared gifts and laughter. I had the most fun watching Lin unwrap her teddy bear. The outer box was apparently mailed from Fred to me, the next inner box was from me to Fred; the next inner box was from Fred to Lin; the next inner box was from Lin to Lin; the next inner box was from Lin to Ma; the next inner bag was from Ma to Mama; the next inner box was from Mama to me, but that box was actually for Lin, which she could see very clearly from its branding.</description>
