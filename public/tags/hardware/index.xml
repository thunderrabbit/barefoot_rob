      <description>13:51 Monday 05 February 2018 JST Is it a waste to get a new phone after my phone&amp;rsquo;s screen broke to the point that I put tape on it to keep pieces of glass from falling out?
Seems like it in some ways, but maybe most of all because I didn&amp;rsquo;t keep the phone encased in case it fell, which it eventually did, and shattered the screen.
New phone arrived yesterday and was really easy to copy the bulk of data over and download apps again.</description>

All of the above letters were pressed while I held down the right hand shift key. I think it&amp;rsquo;s forgotten how to send its code.</description>

      <description>10:51 Friday 07 July 2017 JST Nice.
It came with some little cards that can be used to focus, and some pages that can be used to plan scenes.. maybe I will sketch some out now.
08:11 Saturday 08 July 2017 JST Yesterday I ended up with about 80 frames of completed video.
  I might redo them from a different camera angle, but that would mean (starting over and) making a new shelf (or something) to hold the camera.</description>

      <description>15:15 Friday 23 December 2016 JST The photos I took are trapped on my iPhone because I didn&amp;rsquo;t bring an adapter. Oh yay Mikako has a purple cable.</description>
