<p>I am at a hospital with Lin after a little fender bender involving a
guy&rsquo;s shoulder hitting her mirror hard enough to cut her hand as the
glass shattered into her open window.</p>

<p>The police officer came and suggested it will be easiest/cheapest
overall if they don&rsquo;t sue each other and just do <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> blame and call
it in to their respective insurance companies.  Otherwise they will
both lose their license etc etc.</p>

<p>Lin&rsquo;s fine, and the guy&rsquo;s apparently fine; goodness gracious I hope
she starts being more careful.</p>

<p>On my way home yesterday there was an ambulance and police car next to
traffic light near our house.  Lin&rsquo;s uncle was there and he goes
&ldquo;Lin&rsquo;s in the ambulance&rdquo;</p>

<p>!!!</p>

<p>Holy shit wait what?</p>

<p>I was so relieved to see her alert and essentially &ldquo;fine&rdquo; though it&rsquo;s
still super spooky fuck fuck fuck!</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t have my computer at the time so I didn&rsquo;t write about it last
night.</p>

<p>Right now she is talking to a guy from her insurance company I think,
explaining the situation.</p>

<p>For some reason, no one got the car driver&rsquo;s insurance information
last night, even though police were called and documented the
accident.</p>

<p>The lady said she didn&rsquo;t know the insurance info, and didn&rsquo;t give any
info except her own name and phone number.</p>

<p>She said she&rsquo;d have her insurance people call, but they haven&rsquo;t yet
(which is why I&rsquo;m starting to document this situation).</p>

<p>After the accident, Lin&rsquo;s mom and aunt happened across her; they were
going to eat dinner in the nearby restaurant.  I don&rsquo;t know when her
uncle arrived.  I arrived on my way home, saw him, and he told me to
go back to the ambulance.</p>

<p>Lin&rsquo;s mom and aunt were in there with her, and Lin said she&rsquo;d prefer
to have me with her and they went to dinner while Lin and I went to
the hosptial.</p>

<p>We were in the ambulance for a bit while they asked a couple questions
about allergies and sorted out an available hospital.  We went to
Saiwai Hospital in Kawasaki.</p>

<p>They took a CT scan which the radiologist said appears normal.</p>
