      <description>22:47 Wednesday 11 October 2017 JST I am at a hospital with Lin after a little fender bender involving a guy&amp;rsquo;s shoulder hitting her mirror hard enough to cut her hand as the glass shattered into her open window.
The police officer came and suggested it will be easiest/cheapest overall if they don&amp;rsquo;t sue each other and just do 50&amp;frasl;50 blame and call it in to their respective insurance companies.</description>

      <description>13:21 Monday 27 April 2015 JST On my way home yesterday there was an ambulance and police car next to traffic light near our house. Lin&amp;rsquo;s uncle was there and he goes &amp;ldquo;Lin&amp;rsquo;s in the ambulance&amp;rdquo;
!!!
Holy shit wait what?
I was so relieved to see her alert and essentially &amp;ldquo;fine&amp;rdquo; though it&amp;rsquo;s still super spooky fuck fuck fuck!
I didn&amp;rsquo;t have my computer at the time so I didn&amp;rsquo;t write about it last night.</description>
