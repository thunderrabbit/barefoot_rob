I felt a little bit guilty, but I stole this poster from the train. The girl is just too cute to pass up. I learned my lesson by not taking the Gemma Ward ad until too late.

      <description>##14:04 Sunday 15 July 2007
Looking back over the years, I&amp;rsquo;m surprised by how much time and how much money I&amp;rsquo;ve devoted to English, the world&amp;rsquo;s most dominant language. Sometimes I love English, but sometimes I really hate it, feeling that my longtime efforts haven&amp;rsquo;t been paying off. I still have difficulty dealing with the language. To begin with, English is illogical and capricious. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to understand it completely even if I keep studying it for the rest of my life.</description>

 Unlike dogs and electronic sensors currently in use, the wasps are disposable. They cost pennies and take minutes to train.

These are the long jokes I know. They are more like stories with silly punchlines. I wrote the one about the kid who loves to do dishes.
 How to catch a pink elephant
 Moe and Joe
 Kid who loved green golf balls
 Kid who loved clowns
 Magician and the captain&amp;rsquo;s parrot
 Kid who loved to do dishes
 Ten little piggies</description>
