      <description>(written 19:07 Wednesday 11 September 2019 JST)
We had a typhoon Sunday night / Monday morning. It was fine for us, but a doozy in some parts of our area. People died.
Trains stopped, trapping 13k people in Narita airport (Photo from Kyodo News).

Leaves blown everywhere.
 
Two high tenstion power towers collapsed.
And the one that amazes me most for its precision destruction, a net blew down from a golf driving range and sliced roofs of houses.</description>
