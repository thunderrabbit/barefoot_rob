Today Lin and I are at Charu&amp;rsquo;s house (with the whole family of her generation and under).
I accompanied Makarin and Takumi to the park where we played games similar to Calvinball. While Takumi made up rules in realtime, Mikarin was like はいはい.
I rather liked my game, basically throw a rubber ball onto a 3D monkey-bar grid and get points based on where it first touches the ground.</description>
