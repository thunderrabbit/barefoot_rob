  Those are redacted instructions that showed AWS support that something seemed amiss with the elastic load balancer.
M helped me activate tcpdump and we captured output while recreating the error in different capacities.</description>

      <description>20:26 Thursday 18 April 2019 JST It turns out I am not eligible for AWS free tier.. Thank goodness for their billing alarms. It went off at $3 and I was like whhaaa??
It turns out free tier is only for new customers less than a year old. I have had my account for ages.. Why would their interface say free tier next to anything while I am logged in?</description>

      <description>15:24 Friday 02 March 2018 JST We have an image server behind cloudfront. Cloudfront can serve everything via https when using its subdomain. But using our own domain with https isn&amp;rsquo;t as easy as I would like.
Running Lets Encrypt on the server, I get an error like the https request was not allowed.
So I created a certificate with AWS Certificate Manager and told Cloudfront to use it, but I do not see how to tell the server to use it.</description>

      <description>12:27 Wednesday 15 November 2017 JST Not actually sbs.net, but yes actually AWS. Using Ansible again, thanks to Travis having suggested it to me.
Right now as I write this entry, AWS my wifi in this cafe is being slow to realize that my VPC is already created. Not sure why, as it was fast a moment ago.
Yep it just timed out.

      <description>13:57 Saturday 06 February 2016 JST Sweet!
Thanks to https://acloud.guru/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate/learn/ec2/load-balancers-health-checks I have created a proof of concept set of web servers connected by a load balancer which automatically scales depending on usage requirements.

The terminated instances were automagically replaced with the running instances. :-)</description>

      <description>16:33 Wednesday 13 January 2016 JST Now, I&amp;rsquo;m not 100% sure this is a bug, but I reported to AWS a few days ago:
S3 bug: cannot create two lifecycle rules that apply to whole S3 bucket  That&amp;rsquo;s just the title; I spelled it out a bit in the body of the message.
But today I got back a steaming pile of useless reply:
Hello Rob, This is ______ from the AWS Billing Department.</description>

      <description>##09:33 Thursday 12 February 2015 JST##
Yesterday I worked several hours trying to get my AWS instance to talk to an RDS instance on a VPC. I set &amp;ldquo;Publically accessable&amp;rdquo; to true, set the Security group to (wide open/allow the AWS instance security group), but I still couldn&amp;rsquo;t connect.
My great idea now is to create an AMI based on the AWS instance, then spin up a new instance of the AMI in the same VPC as the RDS.</description>

      <description>##13:36 Wednesday 10 December 2014 JST##
I eventually want to have a cloud server on which I have root access, but right now, especially for this site, I don&amp;rsquo;t need it.
On Dreamhost, I killed the DNS entry pointing hakyll.robnugen.com to my EC2 instance, then asked Dreamhost to host hakyll.robnugen.com, but the DNS doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to have updated yet.
HI! I had a custom DNS record pointing hakyll.robnugen.com to an IP on Amazon AWS server.</description>

These notes should work for *nix, including OS X, which I&amp;rsquo;m using. Windows users may have to adapt when it comes to local stuff.
Easy as
 get server with root access set up Nginx on server set up Hakyll locally  ##1. sign up for AWS micro (free tier available)##
I will probably go with all their defaults:
####Step 1:####
For this, I&amp;rsquo;m using Amazon Linux AMI 2014.</description>

      <description>Running Hakyll on Dreamhost AWS
UPDATE: Run Hakyll for free on AWS is a better tutorial than the mess below.
I gave up trying to install Hakyll on Dreamhost when I realized I probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to install Haskell at all. I have a ticket in to DH now, but I bet they&amp;rsquo;ll say &amp;ldquo;sorry, not on shared hosting; why don&amp;rsquo;t you try our VPS?&amp;rdquo;
The following is based on notes I took from https://marcanuy.</description>

      <description>Why can&amp;rsquo;t I log in to AWS? My password is stored in my password manager; my MFA token is working fine. Moe Joe this is not something I want to fight each time I need to make a change on website. Bah.</description>
