      <description>12:58 Saturday 14 July 2018 JST Working on MT3 today I had a funny idea. There were two marbles ready to roll off the track and I realized it would be great for the spoonhead guy to catch them. So I had to erase eight frames, but they were not too hard to recreate, and the end result is great.
  The frames are shown in the last second of the video above.</description>
