      <description>09:14 Wednesday 20 December 2017 -03 Here is Brazil, cashew fruit are available at any fruit stand.
I tried the fruit. So much water spilling out I think it should be called watermelon. Very stringy and not so delicious, but edible.
Once I finished the fruit, I looked at the stem looking thing.
Wait, so you&amp;rsquo;re telling me there&amp;rsquo;s a cashew nut in here? That&amp;rsquo;s awesome!
It was too hard to crack with my fingers, so I used my teeth to try to crack it open.</description>
