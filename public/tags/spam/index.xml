Hi Nugen, I emailed you a few months back to discuss any outstanding receivables you may have. As I mentioned in my previous email we work with many Businessâ€™s across the nation and we have developed a very strong approach for your industry as a whole. During our tenure of working with these companies we have liquidated more than 50% (one as high as 70%) of the dollars placed with us for some of our clients.</description>

I just got an email (that I opened!!) and noted it was sent to an email address I entered on adobe.com
The content looks vaguely legit, but it starts to get spooky when looking at the URL link (The TLD is .rocks)
Clicking that sends me to a sales website to get the latest doodads from nothing related to Medicare. Yeah, I don&amp;rsquo;t think Adobe sold my address to them.</description>
