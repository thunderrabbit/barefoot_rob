      <description>23:56 Monday 01 January 2018 JST We have arrived back in Haneda and are in a taxi back home. Didn&amp;rsquo;t realize trains would not be running very late so yay for 12000 yen for stale smoke flavored taxi.
Last train was at 11:51 and would require two transfers, including from KQ Kawasaki to JR Kawasaki station.
I get to work on MT3 tomorrow yayyy!</description>
