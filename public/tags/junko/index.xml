      <description>15:59 Sunday 21 October 2018 JST On my way to SOGO there was a blue car amongst the stalls where people were selling bread and beads and stuff. Huh. Old car looks new. It was old, and I asked the guy how old it was. Older than me by 2 years.
After SOGO I talked to him (in English) for about 20 minutes, and met his daughter, who has an accupuncture place nearby.</description>
