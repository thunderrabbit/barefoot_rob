      <description>15:12 Friday 27 October 2017 JST Jennie has a pet door in our room now so she can go in and out. The door has a lock so that it can work both directions, neither direction, or this xor that direction.
The guy cut a hole in the glass and it was not like on Mission Impossible. He used a diamond tip to make a circle and then a smaller circle, and then a grid of cuts in the middle of the small circle, then tap tap tapped with a metal rod.</description>
