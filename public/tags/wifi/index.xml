      <description>11:57 Monday 24 July 2017 JST About once a week I eat lunch at Wired Cafe in Lazona. I always order the same thing (salad pizza, unsliced), sit in the same place (near an electrical outlet), and joke around with the manager when he is in.
One time I busted out my Japanese and ordered five (5) cheesecake sundaes. チーズケーキいつつお願いします。 and he was like five?? And I was like haha just joking.</description>
