<p>I was the only other man to show up for D&rsquo;s men&rsquo;s circle tonight.  We
walked to a park near his house which has a wooded area.</p>

<p>Away from the busy-ness of the park, we settled in for a meditation
and then got into my work.  Wondering how to balance my projects,
where to focus my energy, how to do the right thing?</p>

<p>The feelings of fear and sadness took me back to a time with my dad.
He told me we would make a cool project together, basically a bigger
better pinball machine with sounds and lights and ramps going
everywhere.  Holy shit that sounds awesome!  I looked forward to that
project for years until I realized it was never going to happen.</p>

<p>That feeling just sat and festered and rot away my connection to
creativity until it is just a smidgen of what it used to be or could
have been.  Why the fuck did he lie to me?</p>

<p>&ldquo;why did you lie to me???  You told me not to like, but then you lied!
It&rsquo;s not fair!&rdquo;  crying crying crying in the woods.  Gasping gut
wrenching sobbing cry with 100 tears for all the years it has been
rotting inside me.</p>

<p>Some security guard came up and told us to get out of the woods, but he gave us
space when he saw me crying.</p>

<p>Got all the tears out and then turned it into blessings.</p>

<p>I forgive myself for believing my dad could do anything.
I forgive myself for not knowing what to do at 7 years old.</p>

<p>I thank spirit for the creative connection which is fully available to
me.</p>

<p>I have my dad&rsquo;s blessing to go forward with my creative endeavors.</p>

<p class=date>3:07pm Saturday 10 January 1998</p>

<p><font size=-1>(transcribed from my diary)</font>
<p>
I just had an incredible experience at Kathy Fey&rsquo;s.  She is my body work professional type person, using Cranio-Sachral balancing, Reiki (sp) and massage to keep my body happy.
<p>
I&rsquo;ve been doing body work with her for a while and today she focused on my left hip. There&rsquo;s been a bit of nagging almost pain there and to determine what is the deal with it, we did a &ldquo;dialogue.&rdquo;
<p>
I went to my meditation hill in my mind and sat gently there for a bit.  Then Kathy invited someone to help guide us with the process.  A woman in white walked up and when prompted, invited us to refer to her as Mother.
<p>
Kathy asked about the source of the injury and I visioned a stabbing downward from behind with a bayonette during a war. Someone stabbed me back there and I collapsed during the Civil War and I wasn&rsquo;t able to see my family and I felt so sad and cried and cried on her table.  I drug my body dragging my left leg and ended up in the woods, falling asleep at night and dying that night.
<p>
Kathy asked if I could see who had stabbed me and I saw his face, green hat and brown moustache and it was Forest! in a previous life who had stabbed me.  Before I recognized him I forgave him and was really surprised when I saw who it was.  I explained to Kathy how I know him this lifetime.
<p>
We called to the hill anyone that I wronged during the war and about 7 or 12 men were there.  I felt I did not see their faces when I killed them as they were too far away.  I suspect I shot them.  I asked them all for forgiveness and was forgiven by some but not by all the men.
<p>
We let them go about their way and asked Mother if we could release the tension in my hip.  She said Yes but not as quickly as I would like.  We asked if there was anything else and she said she was so proud of me and my work.  I cried and cried again to hear that.  Wonderful
<p>
Mother had to leave so we thanked her and let her go.  We need only ask to have her return.
<p>
Wow.  I was amazed by the experience.  Part of me wants proof but I am currently content to believe it is precisely true.</p></p>
