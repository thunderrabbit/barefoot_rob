                        <p>Had an hour lesson with Liliko, during which we double checked the
English for an AI game they are developing.  For some reason they keep
asking for confirmation of stuff on paper but it has gotten to the
point that we would prefer to see the real thing in action in order to
really make sure it&rsquo;s all correct.</p>

<p>Also had a lesson with Azusa, during which we clarified some of her
translation into English, changing the word &ldquo;become&rdquo; into &ldquo;because&rdquo;
and stuff like replacing &ldquo;addition and multiplication are done by
turning the handle outside&rdquo; with &ldquo;to add and multiply numbers, we turn
the handle clockwise,&rdquo; partially because she could not consistently
say &ldquo;multiplication.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It reminds me of the time I was out of time to do my speech in
Japanese, and just read it off the page instead of knowing what I was
saying.</p>

<p>Today might be the last day I can shop at the nearby shop; their last
day is Monday the 23rd.  I may come back on that day to see if prices
are slashed or what.</p>

<p>Liliko and I talked about the best way to support one of her staff who
wants to guide tours in English, but does not yet have the basics of
English conversation down.  In the past some guides just straight
memorize the scripts but do not fully understand what they are
saying.  We are trying to avoid that if possible.  I suggested
er-central.com and mylanguageexchange.com</p>

<p>I also told her about Dean Ramsden; I am looking forward to working
with him.</p>

<p>Today (and most Thursdays) I taught at SCC in Kawasaki.  Naoko
reviewed for her test next week.  Yasu reviewed the same material for
his test sometime in the future.  Azusa did much better with her
fluency and intonation for her presentation.  Liliko asked about the
brochure that has to change soon to accomodate new opening times.</p>

<p>After the lessons I went to say HI to Tomoko and Midori, but Midori
had the day off.  Tomoko showed me how to RSVP on Circle Square for
next month&rsquo;s badminton game.</p>

<p>Three hours of lessons in SCC today; looking forward to it!</p>

<p>On the way there, I hope to figure out why my local version of
mypowercircle.org will not compile with Hugo.  bah.  it was supposed
to be easy!!</p>

<p>Ah. I had gotten stuck trying to add Japanese language version of the
site, but never got it working.  It&rsquo;s better to just have an actual
Japanese speaker make the Japanese site, so I cut out the Japanese
content from the site and now it&rsquo;s working again.</p>

<p>Great lessons today with Miyako, Yuki (first lesson with her), Naoko,
Mizuho, Liliko, and Tomoe.</p>

<p>Today was the first time I worked five hours at SCC.  Due to a
schedule snafu, 1.5 hours with Liliko chatting about her trip to
Sydney and my trip to OZ, then Rick and Morty and Lucifer.  I didn&rsquo;t
think of Dirk Gently, but she considered getting Netflix to see the
others.</p>
