      <description>A Twisted Christmas
30 December 1998
A TWISTED CHRISTMAS read the card featuring red and white twisted glistening candy stripes. A rave on 26 December from 10pm to 6am and the first 500 people in the door get a free CD! Cool! So I drove home from my dad&#39;s and napped a bit until Amanda and Sally dropped by at 10 and we piled into Amanda&#39;s car and zipped away.. first to Walgreen&#39;s to get ear plugs which turned out to be quite useful.</description>

1:11pm Saturday 19 December 1998 (10496)

(transcribed from my diary)
I just spent 2 hours online doing email and updating website and the SWD YRUU website. Yesterday was asesome! To kick it off, Glen called me back and was super exciting about signing up with Flashnet! yay!! Then Ben Easton and I went skating around Rice University, got kicked off (gently) by a Rice Cop and went to eat at Bibas and discussed Y2K predictions, and our philosophies of god and cosmology.</description>
