      <description>18:34 Sunday 27 August 2017 JST I have been taking (but not really posting) pictures of the new train line in Noborito station. I guess it&amp;rsquo;s part of the campaign Odakyu has been announcing that they will reduce the congestion on the line, and even decrease the time required to go to Shinjuku.
Anyway, they did something which surprised me: put down the rails, locked them down, then took them back up before laying them down again.</description>

      <title>still learning trains in Fujisawa</title>

      <description>19:19 Wednesday 22 June 2016 JST Fujisawa is the last stop on this branch of the Odakyu Line. (Another terminal is Odawara.)
I&amp;rsquo;m not yet sure which trains pass which other trains by the time they get to our station.
But at least I can easily get a seat if I want.
19:50 barf. I would swear the sign said this train was going all the way to Shinjuku, but now it&amp;rsquo;s terminating in Sagami Ono.</description>

      <description>16:58 Tuesday 21 June 2016 JST Ah crap I think I should have waited 5 minutes and taken the faster train.</description>

Seat Lottery is the game I like to play on the trains. If there are no seats available, size up the passengers to see who is most likely to get off the train first. Demographics, fashion, activity, and posture each play a role.
The person to my left will get off in Shibuya or possibly before Shibuya. I have made an imaginary bet of $500 that she&amp;rsquo;ll get off the train before I get off in Harajuku.</description>

      <title>Ueno-Tokyo line</title>

      <description>##13:39 Monday 16 March 2015 JST##
Starting 14 March the Tokaido line trains which used to terminate in Tokyo now go on to stations up to like 2 hours north of Tokyo.
So now it looks like we can go from Ito to Ino on a single train. Where the heck is Ino? Iono, but it&amp;rsquo;s up there somewhere.
##13:50
Hilariously, while writing about the new line, I saw some shops and such that looked like Akihabara, &amp;ldquo;hmm!</description>

Aw man, this train terminates one station before where I need to go. I&amp;rsquo;ll (possibly remember to) look more carefully next time.</description>
