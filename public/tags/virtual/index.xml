      <description>11:35 Friday 25 August 2017 JST Today was the fifth of five virtual I-groups designed to give leadership practice to men in the group. Just five men in the group, one night each gives a sense of what it&amp;rsquo;s like and lets men see other men leading the calls.
So I will be the leader leader of the next set of calls, planned for 6 calls starting in October.</description>
