      <description>23:35 Friday 17 April 2015 JST Hmmm.
TL;DR: in Unity3D on my computer, my app looks like this. But after building the app for my browser, it looks like that.
i.e. Line Party should display lines between each piece that has fallen and has had the mouse hovered over it since that time.</description>

      <description>01:29 Sunday 12 April 2015 JST I posted this at https://answers.unity3d.com/questions/945007/programmatically-added-sliderjoint2d-not-respected.html
How can I make sprites fall straight down, and resist any sideways motion whether by dragging or physics?
My code instantiates a prefab at runtime which has an attached script.
The script runs the following function after a while:
void addSliderJoint() { myVerticalSlider = gameObject.AddComponent&amp;lt;SliderJoint2D&amp;gt; () as SliderJoint2D; myVerticalSlider.angle = 90; }  After this functions runs, I&amp;rsquo;d like the sprites to only move vertically, but they seem happy to move without restriction.</description>

      <description>22:31 Friday 03 April 2015 JST I&amp;rsquo;ve been tootling through a couple tutorials on noobtoots noobtuts, and each time had to set up the same settings for git, including a .gitignore file.
So, I made unity3d-starter to get me started.
I&amp;rsquo;m now going through their bejeweled tutorial (and paid 2000 yen for their premium package to get the full toot and source code).</description>
