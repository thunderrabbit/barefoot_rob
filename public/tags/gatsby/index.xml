      <description>20:17 Thursday 14 February 2019 JST A man named Fust has recommended a new stack for Marble Track 3: Airtable as backend, Gatsby as frontend, and some other things I have not heard of. Actually I had not heard of Gatsby.
I have an old VirtualBox sitting around so I spun it up and loaded a Gatsby demo. It pooped out a bunch of deprecation warnings, so I am loathe to really dig into this thing if it will be an ongoing battle against a bunch of deprecations ongoing during the project, as well as making the marble track itself.</description>
