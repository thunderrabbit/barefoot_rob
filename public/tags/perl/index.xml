      <description>15:02 Tuesday 31 March 2015 JST Mutsumi asked if I can make some .svg files for her husband. I tried Artboard, Inkscape and some online things, but none are quite as fast as just spitting out xml via SVG module.
Code is on github svg-fabric.</description>

For the md5 count thing, /u/Thespoian gave me a brilliant insite. Whereas I had been trying to go through all the combinations of uppercase/lowercase, first recursively, then with a &amp;ldquo;brillian&amp;rdquo; bitshifting method, he had just been randomly selecting letters and changing their case pseudorandomly.
I was going for user-friendly GUI. My way (written in Javascript,) was bloated, slow and often locked up Chrome. He was going for getrdone.</description>

(written 10:28 Saturday 28 February 2015) I finished my livemd5 cheater; it went more smoothly than I expected!
In just tens of seconds it can spew hundreds of strings with md5 (hex) hashes which regex match any three digits at the end of the string e.g. /123$/
Too bad everyone else has nearly abandoned the md5sum live count!</description>
