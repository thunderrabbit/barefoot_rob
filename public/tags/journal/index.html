<p>One rule of journaling is to keep it present.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t written about Christine&rsquo;s party not Rin&rsquo;s workshop, but</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m headed to SOGO!  We are apparently meeting in a new location today. I guess there is some kind of festival covering our normal area.
I am super glad I checked, and even more glad Ruri posted the change!</p>

<hr />

<p>Yesterday at the Tokyo Tribe monthly vision planning workshop, we met in B1 of the building from last month.</p>

<p>Sophie, Rin, Hiro, and I attended, and I jokingly said &ldquo;remember back in 2019 when it was just 4 of us at the meeting?&rdquo;</p>

<p>We talked about the viability of larger groups.</p>

<p>Next meeting has been scheduled for a Friday, taking into consideration my Eye Gazing workshop on September 28th!  So thankful and like &ldquo;wow! Is my little workshop really so important?&rdquo; (tears-welling-emoji)</p>

<p>9:58am just arrived at meijijingumae for SOGO!</p>

<h5 id="12-48-sunday-01-september-2019-jst">12:48 Sunday 01 September 2019 JST</h5>

<p>It&rsquo;s not scorching hot like a couple of weeks ago, but still pretty warm.</p>

<p>Today there were lots of new people, and some people I hadn&rsquo;t seen for a while.</p>

<p>Met Mon and Sumin, remet Kinue, Lam, and Mayumi.  Emi wasn&rsquo;t there, but Ruri, Hide, and Moise led.</p>

<p>Anuj confirmed he will attend Past Lives workshop, and Alex seemed interested.  Yay!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m tired, falling asleep on the train.</p>

                        <p>I have often wondered about ways to write journal entries on some small device and incorporate them into my online journal.</p>

<p>I used to use a Handspring Visor, until the foldable keyboard folded for the last time and the Visor perhaps got replaced with a laptop?  It had some way to sync, probably USB.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ve got a handheld screen here with Swype keyboard, and I am writing this as an email to myself which I hope to remember to cut and paste into a full on my local file system and incorporate into my git repository for journal entries.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s not why I&rsquo;m writing.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m headed to Rin&rsquo;s monthly planning workshop in Omotesando.  This will be my second time to attend, and I intend to focus on workshops and, curiously, my website.</p>

<p>I want to continue using my existing git repositories (one for the journal, and one for the site itself (because my journal has lasted longer and should stay intact as much as possible (plus I want to keep up my single word commit messages that tell a story, backwards), as if a repository in a fragile file system supports that) which includes the journal as a sub module), even though &ldquo;everyone&rdquo; is like &ldquo;just use Squarespace!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sorry, nope. Not gonna use Squarespace or WordPress or Ghost.  I&rsquo;ll continue to use Hugo, markdown, and my choice of hosting providers.  I just need some adjustments to my theme.</p>

<p>Specifically, I&rsquo;d like to add some testimonials to my about page, find a nice design for my schedule of workshops and perhaps tweak my tags list to show how many entries are tagged with each tag.</p>

<p>Those changes are of the top of my head, but when it comes time to do them, I get caught up in minutae, like how to adjust the left padding on the border of some div.  Annoying.</p>

<p>Excitingly, I&rsquo;d also like to get feedback on how I can approach the detail of being in the US for three weeks in October.  Any way to continue workshop momentum?  Any need to?</p>

<p>I have gone through all the themes in the repo for
<a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoThemes">All Hugo&rsquo;s Themes</a> and come
up with a list of several which do a lot of these things:</p>

<ul>
<li>content on top page</li>
<li>list page for blog/</li>
<li>list page for journal/</li>
<li>paginate blog/</li>
<li>paginate journal/</li>
<li>show tags</li>
<li>paginate tags</li>
<li>show categories</li>
<li>paginate categories</li>
<li>nicely show Youtube videos</li>

<p>I wanted to swap the commas a bit so I rewrote the commit messages
with <code>git rebase 68a8c08</code>.  Now the top of <code>git log --oneline --graph --decorate
--all</code> looks like this (sans colorization):</p>

<pre><code>* 7dc0917 (HEAD -&gt; master) back
* 10b1b54 some,
* 35be077 well,
* 0bd1c8b several
| * 84efab7 (norigin/master, github/master, bitbucket/master) some
| * 143640e well,
| * a8b25db several,
|/
* 68a8c08 years
* 34b1460 ago
* b62b05e when
* 8f33818 he
* 7ce3602 was
</code></pre>

<p>After writing this, I started composing a message on <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/">english.stackexchange.com</a></p>

<pre><code>I am writing a story in which an US American man is being
interviewed.  The man is relaying a story which happened in the
past.  To describe how long ago it happened, he uses the word
&quot;some&quot; and then wants to revise it to &quot;several (years ago).&quot;

Without punctuation, it would be transcribed as

... that was back some well several years ago when he was still ...

I am debating between adding commas to indicate pauses either as

A. that was back some, well, several years ago when he was still ...

or

B. that was back some well, several, years ago when he was still ...
</code></pre>

<p>but ended up not posting it as there are several answers already.</p>

<p>If I revert back a couple of commits I can get it to compile, but
still have not gotten Netlify to clone the repo and its submodules,
due to permissions on Github.</p>

<p>I write journal entries with Emacs because I never learned vi.
Anyway, I just tweaked my journal creation macros to use templates
instead of embedded strings.</p>

<p>Much easier to tweak and easier on the eyes.</p>

<p>Next step is to make a macro for episodes on my new website
marbletrack3.com</p>

<p>Been working on MT3 pretty consistently, and started working on AB
again now that the new verbal agreement has started.</p>

<p>Recently I found
<a href="https://complice.co/?r=pgej30cphu">complice (referral link)</a> which
seems like a pretty good system for organizing my day and stuff.  I
have 19 days in my free test period.</p>

<p>Complice has a slight learning curve, but built-in pomodoros plus a
magic way that when I open a new tab it reminds me what my latest
thing to do is.  Complice connects my tasks with my larger goals, and
allows me to fill in some of the WHY I am doing different tasks, to
help keep me on task.</p>

<p>It is because of complice that I am writing this journal entry now.</p>

<p>Anyway, I stubbed the <del>crap out</del> <ins>skin off</ins> of my
toe yesterday and will wear shoes for a bit.</p>

<p>I wonder how long that image will be available.</p>

<p>Right now I am writing this entry while waiting for the AB server to
finish its backup.</p>

<p>Ah wait a minute.  Another backup started at the same time.  That may
be why they are going slowly.  I will look at them tomorrow.</p>

<p>To kick off this little journal entry, I type C-c j and then enter the
title, as many tags as I like, then hit enter a few times to confirm
the date, and get the following YAML meta data for the entry:</p>

<pre><code>---
title: &quot;Hugo journal entries with Emacs&quot;
tags: [ &quot;emacs&quot;, &quot;journal&quot;, &quot;quotes&quot;, &quot;hugo&quot; ]
author: Rob Nugen
date: 2017-11-08T13:42:06+09:00
---

## 13:42 Wednesday 08 November 2017 JST
</code></pre>

<p>Today I modified my code to add quotes around the title (so my Marble
Track 3 entries can have titles including colons: &ldquo;mt3: started last
track&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, I modified my Japanese journal entries to make the filename be
English, but the title be Japanese.  That was done just by hardcoding
the filename, but for now I am fine with that.  Just don&rsquo;t tell
Travis.</p>

<p>Code for <code>~/.emacs.d/personal/hakyll/hakyll.el</code>is here
