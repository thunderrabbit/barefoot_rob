      <description>One rule of journaling is to keep it present.
I haven&amp;rsquo;t written about Christine&amp;rsquo;s party not Rin&amp;rsquo;s workshop, but
I&amp;rsquo;m headed to SOGO! We are apparently meeting in a new location today. I guess there is some kind of festival covering our normal area. I am super glad I checked, and even more glad Ruri posted the change!
Yesterday at the Tokyo Tribe monthly vision planning workshop, we met in B1 of the building from last month.</description>

      <description>I have often wondered about ways to write journal entries on some small device and incorporate them into my online journal.
I used to use a Handspring Visor, until the foldable keyboard folded for the last time and the Visor perhaps got replaced with a laptop? It had some way to sync, probably USB.
Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;ve got a handheld screen here with Swype keyboard, and I am writing this as an email to myself which I hope to remember to cut and paste into a full on my local file system and incorporate into my git repository for journal entries.</description>

      <description>15:19 Tuesday 25 June 2019 JST I have gone through all the themes in the repo for All Hugo&amp;rsquo;s Themes and come up with a list of several which do a lot of these things:
 content on top page list page for blog/ list page for journal/ paginate blog/ paginate journal/ show tags paginate tags show categories paginate categories nicely show Youtube videos  I don&amp;rsquo;t know if a single one does all the above things, but here is my list so far:</description>

      <description>06:22 Monday 17 June 2019 JST I wanted to swap the commas a bit so I rewrote the commit messages with git rebase 68a8c08. Now the top of git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all looks like this (sans colorization):
* 7dc0917 (HEAD -&amp;gt; master) back * 10b1b54 some, * 35be077 well, * 0bd1c8b several | * 84efab7 (norigin/master, github/master, bitbucket/master) some | * 143640e well, | * a8b25db several, |/ * 68a8c08 years * 34b1460 ago * b62b05e when * 8f33818 he * 7ce3602 was  After writing this, I started composing a message on english.</description>

      <description>17:40 Sunday 22 July 2018 JST I write journal entries with Emacs because I never learned vi. Anyway, I just tweaked my journal creation macros to use templates instead of embedded strings.
Much easier to tweak and easier on the eyes.
Next step is to make a macro for episodes on my new website marbletrack3.com</description>

      <description>15:04 Monday 12 February 2018 JST Been working on MT3 pretty consistently, and started working on AB again now that the new verbal agreement has started.
Recently I found complice (referral link) which seems like a pretty good system for organizing my day and stuff. I have 19 days in my free test period.
Complice has a slight learning curve, but built-in pomodoros plus a magic way that when I open a new tab it reminds me what my latest thing to do is.</description>

      <description>13:42 Wednesday 08 November 2017 JST To kick off this little journal entry, I type C-c j and then enter the title, as many tags as I like, then hit enter a few times to confirm the date, and get the following YAML meta data for the entry:
--- title: &amp;quot;Hugo journal entries with Emacs&amp;quot; tags: [ &amp;quot;emacs&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;journal&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;quotes&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;hugo&amp;quot; ] author: Rob Nugen date: 2017-11-08T13:42:06+09:00 --- ## 13:42 Wednesday 08 November 2017 JST  Today I modified my code to add quotes around the title (so my Marble Track 3 entries can have titles including colons: &amp;ldquo;mt3: started last track&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>11:58 Saturday 16 September 2017 JST I put this leaf down but before it could grow much past the pics shown here, it got cleaned up by the annual clearing done by city workers.
 
After the annual clear cut seemed to be complete, I found a spot that had not been cleared. It is still in the same park, but on a sidewalk, so maybe it will be clearcut by a different team.</description>

      <description>10:44 Friday 07 July 2017 JST Nice. I can still only read one tag, but now at least my function writes (e.g.)
tags: [ &amp;quot;journal&amp;quot; ]  instead of
tags: [ &amp;ldquo;journal&amp;rdquo; ]
so I can add tags more easily.</description>

      <description>23:29 Monday 01 May 2017 JST The developers of Hugo, without consulting me, changed the rssLimit default from 15 to unlimited because it&amp;rsquo;s the least surprising. That seems weird to me, so I changed it to 70 because that is apparently the smallest Weird number. https://www2.stetson.edu/~efriedma/numbers.html
173 was my next choice because 173 x 173 = 29929.</description>

      <description>21:47 Wednesday 28 September 2016 JST I&amp;rsquo;ve just gone through and updated for Hugo my entire set of entries from 2003. But before I copy them over to the repo, I want to figure out how to add ふりがな to 漢字 again so I can study some more.</description>

      <description>13:13 Wednesday 28 September 2016 JST Hugo is picky about the date format. It&amp;rsquo;s gotta look like this 2016-09-28T13:13:05+09:00 which I&amp;rsquo;m sure is a named standard, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know the name.
Right now, after reverting an old commit in which I removed a lot of dates because Middleman couldn&amp;rsquo;t deal with dates after 3pm, I have 245 dates which Hugo cannot parse.
I copied and truncated each line from the list of errors from Hugo&amp;rsquo;s output, and have 245 lines like these three:</description>

      <description>11:34 Sunday 17 January 2016 JST My goal for this train ride is to create a macro that will insert a new timestamp if I keypress C-c 3. I was going to do C-c #; maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll do both.
12:14 failed. I thought this
(defun markdown-timestamp-full () &amp;quot;Insert timestamp in markdown format. NOT&amp;quot; (insert (format-time-string &amp;quot;## %H:%M %A %d %B %Y %Z&amp;quot;) ) )  plus this
(global-set-key (kbd &amp;quot;C-c #&amp;quot;) &#39;markdown-timestamp-full)  Would do it, but I get Wrong type argument: commandp, markdown-timestamp-full</description>

      <description>12:45 Sunday 27 December 2015 JST Right now I enter tags comma separated on a single line. They are written as typed in the &amp;hellip; whatsitcalled (frontmatter?).. the text at the top of each file, which in the case of this file, looks like this:

      <description>16:14 Wednesday 17 June 2015 JST On brief glance, I&amp;rsquo;ve got the top page and journal pages working in Hugo with the same content and URLs as Middleman has been producing for new.robnugen.com. (though I haven&amp;rsquo;t checked the Japanese-titled entries (or entries with multi-word titles. (okay okay I only checked one entry))) Next I need to add the samples repos and make sure those URLs all work nicely.
After all that, I might convert all my journal entries tags sections to use the format Hugo expects.</description>

      <description>12:40 Saturday 23 May 2015 JST I&amp;rsquo;m writing this from my MBP. The Dell crawled to molasses speed after a bit, and I&amp;rsquo;m still optimistic that I won&amp;rsquo;t have to powercycle it. It&amp;rsquo;s still a bit responsive, so I just want to close some programs and see if I can get it working again without shutting it down completely.
12:50 The Dell is responding again, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t need to merge anything in git; I pushed from local MBP and then pulled, committed, and pushed on Dell and now pulled on MBP, so I&amp;rsquo;m back to 95% thinking I&amp;rsquo;ll have to merge somewhere in the near future.</description>

Okay, The journal entry I&amp;rsquo;m writing now is in my journal repo (or will be once I push it there).
In this repo, coming from my old journal, I think there are several instances of URLs like /images/&amp;hellip;. in various entries.
I would like those to keep working, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to put all my images in this repo, or even my Middleman repo because it&amp;rsquo;s more likely to change than my images, and images take up more disk space, generally speaking.</description>

I got my repos sorted today; all the journal entries have had frontmatter lobotomies if Middleman can&amp;rsquo;t deal with the different dates, and my main Middleman repo includes the journal entry repo as a submodule.
However, turns out netlify doesn&amp;rsquo;t clone recursively (yet). I mentioned this to Mathias and he was like, &amp;ldquo;hmm you&amp;rsquo;re right&amp;rdquo; and said he would look into it. But, he said politely, he was planning to go home for the night and didn&amp;rsquo;t want to push any possibly-breaking changes before going to bed.</description>

But my journal template maker doesn&amp;rsquo;t work properly; it creates the buffer and fills it in, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t switch to the buffer anymore. Hmm.</description>

      <description>##18:22 Saturday 14 February 2015 JST##
For years, I have been writing my journal entries in directories based on the date. Originally in YYYY/MM directories, and now (temporarily?) in YYYY/MM/DD directories.
So while recently trying to consolidate all my journal entries, I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to maintain that directory structure, lest I have several thousand(?) files in one directory.
Travis got me started on Hakyll, but I&amp;rsquo;m too lazy and he&amp;rsquo;s too busy to update the Haskell source with cool bells and whistles.</description>

This place is nice and quiet; I think there may be only one other couple here. We had each hot spring bath to ourselves, the entire lobby to ourselves, the entire hall to ourselves.
We took a bus from Shinjuku to Kawaguchiko, and then the hotel sent a shuttle to shuttle us to the hotel. The driver reeked of cigarette smoke, and the van was equally bad.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a few hours today processing my old school journal entries for inclusion in my hakyll journal. I have been doing it all in emacs, with some macros to speed up the process (of processing them).
The first macro redacts email address domains from comments:

Over the past few days we have been emailing back and forth, mostly with me going &amp;ldquo;uh huh&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;yeah&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s right&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;great!&amp;rdquo; as he explains the intricacies of the best way to create a haskell library.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been studying Learn You a Haskell and considering buying Graham Hutton&amp;rsquo;s book, and am excited to have my static journal back, very excited to have Travis making a kick-ass library to seamlessly(?</description>

Got an email from Travis today indicating that he refactored my Hakyll installation. Whoohoo!!
The refactorization he&amp;rsquo;s done so far is visible here.
The biggest changes (in terms of me not understanding them well) are in one file. https://github.com/TravisCardwell/hakyll-journal/commit/05416e71fbbf0f910bcc19717ee88d7ae810c9bd.
I&amp;rsquo;m going to put all his changes into the &amp;lsquo;master&amp;rsquo; branch, merge them into my recently created &amp;lsquo;rob&amp;rsquo; branch, then replace my personalized content in master with some generic stuff so it&amp;rsquo;s easier for people to use this repo for their own Hakyll installations.</description>

Travis suggested it might be a bit challenging to add pagination and the calendar indices that I want in my journal, and he told me about Pelican in Python and I found Sculpin in PHP.
I&amp;rsquo;ve installed both of those with the hope that they could just use the same markdown files as my Hakyll site, but they each have slightly different requirements for the meta data.</description>

I will probably remove the &amp;ldquo;description:&amp;rdquo; meta data (cause I never use it), and eventually I&amp;rsquo;d like to have default values for year, month, and date fields.
##14:00##
Oh crud; it creates the files in the incorrect directory.

      <description>Things to do related to this Hakyll static site:
 Make sure I&amp;rsquo;m not being charged for my micro instance on AWS. If I am, then consider using Jekyll on DH.
 Finish the git-based hook system for posting my journal online via git pushes.
 Tweak the site generation code so the URLs include the date, and so the files themselves are organized in directories by date. I don&amp;rsquo;t want a bajillion files in one giant /posts directory (or even 100)</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a new recommendation for journaling: be able to journal anytime. Until wifi is free everywhere I go, web-based journaling software just won&amp;rsquo;t suffice. Gotta have a book or in this case a laptop that I carry around. Otherwise I lose countless moments to the lack of internet connectivity.
Today I went to JB for training on Wednesday morning lessons starting next week. I&amp;rsquo;m a bit nervous (?) teaching classes in a style I&amp;rsquo;ve never taught before: 15 or 20 kids, 5 year old!</description>

Boom. Got me what might be my new journal for a long time to come, if I can figure out how to make the directory structure the way I want, and ifff I can figure out a way to put images in here that is fast and friendly and all that.
I -might- attempt to write a thingy in Haskell to do it.
For now, I just need to set up a way to serve this from Dreamhost.</description>

Though it&amp;rsquo;s a lot slower than Wordpress (and only version 0.8.2), I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying using Koken on my site; it looks beautiful and seems to handle images more inclusively rather than as a tacked-on thing.
So for a while, robnugen.com/blog may see fewer entries while I play with robnugen.com/koken.
If I really like it, I&amp;rsquo;ll make /koken be default for my site.</description>

Today at work I had a brilliant idea to have prev(ious) and next buttons work as expected.
The blog entry index allows people to view e.g. only this category or that category or just this month or just last years entries.
Once they click the link to view a specific entry, the site has no idea what order nor what subset of entries was in the index.</description>

 protected function search($search_text = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;, $limit = 0, $page_num = 1){ return $this-&amp;gt;runSearchLimitOffset($search_text, $limit, $limit * (($page_num &amp;gt; 0) ?</description>

I was thinking recently how I didn&amp;rsquo;t use lawnchair to keep track of which items were on a page when coming back to it.
But today I did use lawnchair for a different thing, mostly because I was already using lawnchair for a similar issue. There&amp;rsquo;s a page which uses Datatables to display lists of units in the system. When clicking to view a particular unit, there are previous and next buttons on the page.</description>

This morning I added a score calculator that takes into consideration the number of cards remaining. I figure if only a few cards remain, then it&amp;rsquo;s easier to find the correct one.
It also makes use of prime numbers and floats in an attempt to ensure people do not often get the same high score.

Yesterday at work I got the pagination to be ajax driven if javascript is enabled and GET driven if javascript is not enabled.
I&amp;rsquo;ve started to cut a couple corners as the project is a bit overdue. For example, instead of figure out how to redisplay the same units when clicking back to the map page (I&amp;rsquo;d probably use Lawnchair), I just open units in a new tab.</description>

The first few apps we made were all separate projects. The apps were all similar, so I had a huge mess of code for making updates. Specs were all confuzzed in my head; code was all over the place, possibly changed, possibly not. Basically making updates wasn&amp;rsquo;t fun.

Today I went to Yodobashi Camera to buy a camera, but I wanted to confirm that it would work with my computer before purchase. They didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to have any web cameras out of their boxes, so I figured I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to test one before buying.
Rather than try banging my proverbial head against the unbendable rules, I went to Bic Camera to see if they had cameras I could use.</description>

We&amp;rsquo;re walking on a gravel road which I&amp;rsquo;m having a bit of pain navigating, especially while I&amp;rsquo;m typing this on my phone.

We had lunch on a rocky &amp;lsquo;island&amp;rsquo; in the riverbed. A couple of us got wet on the way to the island, me more intentionally than another. After lunch, including lots of community food, I took a little nap, enjoying the warm sun when it was visible between clouds.</description>

Chillin&amp;rsquo; with Travis as Yumi and Lin magic up some yummy dinner (some of which was made by Travis). Deji may be coming over for dinner or maybe after dinner; Travis wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to tell from Deji&amp;rsquo;s email.
Travis made a 3D maze for me! It&amp;rsquo;s not quite 3D so much as it&amp;rsquo;s layers of 2D. It&amp;rsquo;s drawn on a hexaflexagon!</description>

Lin and I went to Aruna&amp;rsquo;s house today; Aruna told us about homeopathy and opened the door to a new way of healthiness. I had heard of it, but just thought homeopathy meant eating well, but apparently it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty specific matching of energetic frequencies to facilitate health.</description>

Lin and I were both feeling kinda sick last week. I&amp;rsquo;ve not meditated in a while, though I might start soon. We&amp;rsquo;re feeling mostly better now, but I&amp;rsquo;ve still got some congestion.
But that&amp;rsquo;s not why I&amp;rsquo;m writing. Lin is talking about starting a diary. I&amp;rsquo;m fully supportive of such things, and hope she gets a lot lot lot and tons of benefit from it.</description>

Riding in the back of a bus, after there had been a pretty devastating earthquake, but we were still trying to go somewhere, and the driver had to back up a try again to go this way or that way around the city to get to where we were going. I was sitting in the back, and Lin was sitting a few seats ahead of me.</description>

3:40am Monday 25 March 2013 Sho was discussing with Jonas about a new site, and I wanted to work on something but didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough information to get started on my site. I tried to get back to work and the scene shifted.
At our old house again, my mom went outside to sleep in the pullman trailer and I went to my old rom. I heard a noise with sounded like the neighbors pulling trailers around so I went outside to make sure they were only pulling their own trailers.</description>

From https://dendory.net/blog.php?id=511ecb55
I&amp;rsquo;m cross posting this here because it&amp;rsquo;s ironic to do so
 There had been rumors around the web, but now it&amp;rsquo;s official, Posterous is shutting down. For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know, Posterous is a Tumblr competitor, a place people used to blog, and a few years back there was no saying which of the two would emerge as the leading platform. Ever since Twitter bought them however, it became obvious that Posterous was losing, and today they confirmed that the whole service is shutting down very soon.</description>

Our new friend Jana happens to live in the same neighborhood as Lin&amp;rsquo;s old high school friend Mikako! Tonight was the night we all met at 6pm in Jiyugaoka for sushi at a 回転すし restaurant and then for a drink and ice cream covered hand made donuts at a shop that Mikako likes.
Talked about Jana&amp;rsquo;s Tour d&amp;rsquo;Afrique experience, Paola&amp;rsquo;s yoga classes (three of us know each other through Paola), my under-construction app, Jana&amp;rsquo;s school (where Mikako used to attend), our love of animals, etc etc blah blah, and generally enjoyed a lovely time.</description>

Lin and I &amp;ldquo;babysat&amp;rdquo; for her sister&amp;rsquo;s daughter Mikako, nicknamed Mikarin. We played memory with a full deck of cards and each won once. We played Othello twice (Mikako beat me, then I beat Lin). Lin took a nap; we all ate cake.
Then when Baba got back to the house, we ate at the smokey restaurant and then Lin and I went home.</description>

Tariq and I are creating a game of memory for iOS. This is my first project that uses blocks, and I must agree, they make coding a lot lot easier!!
This is my second big iOS project, a lot of which is based on Matthijs Hollemans&amp;rsquo; game Snap (currently without the multiplayer stuff), one of Ray Wenderlich&amp;rsquo;s excellent tutorials.
I&amp;rsquo;ve just gotten the in-game tutorial to work, though its alignment&amp;hellip; isn&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

Was in south pacific island and was admiring the piercings of some of the locals. An older guy held two needles in a downward non-threatening way and nodded his head toward me questioningly. I was like &amp;ldquo;sure!&amp;rdquo; and approached him. He quickly and painlessly inserted needles in either side of my upper lip, then out a bit lower, so they didn&amp;rsquo;t actually pierce into the mouth; just like subcutaneous, but not deeper than that.</description>

Today at Tariq&amp;rsquo;s we worked about 4 hours so he bought pizza. Apparently this company is going to put ovens in the delivery vehicles so the pizza cooks on the way to the destination.
He made smaller icons for the menu and I incorporated them. Between arriving home and going to his house, I fixed the timer in each round. At his house, I added a ScoreView based on UILabel.</description>

Lin will look into visas and stuff soon. yay!!</description>

Though we haven&amp;rsquo;t started thinking about a name, Tariq and I have pretty well fleshed out version one of our first card game (during our 10pm - 12am meeting tonight). He&amp;rsquo;s still got to create some assets, and I&amp;rsquo;ve still got to do a good amount of programming, but I can clearly tell that my iOS skillz have increased a lot since our first app.</description>

      <description>##07:23 Friday 18 January 2013
Last night we invited Cecilia over to the house well we invited her on Sunday and Thursday was her and our mutually available day and Lin prepared lovely Texas BBQ in the form of green salad and carrot soup and bean burgers and bread and butter, lots of butter including raisin butter and the dinner was great and Cecilia a gave us lots of ideas on how to do what she calls permaculture, but it&amp;rsquo;s not in the traditional sense of permaculture just for growing crops, but permaculture lifestyle so I am looking forward to implementing some of those, and hope one of us can attend her upcoming workshops in Roppongi and somewhere else.</description>

I wrote this on 750words this morning at 4am.
Just for fun (and because I need to head to work), I&amp;rsquo;ll leave it unedited:
I got a really good set of results from coding in iOS; I used blocks for the first time, incluidng typedef to make them more palatable syntax whise. I&amp;rsquo;ve got a view with a model and it all kinda started with Ray Wenderlich&amp;rsquo;s Snap example or whoever wrote that, but on his site, and I&amp;rsquo;m really thankful for the free stuff, so I believe I shall open source this thing Im making now, a countdown timer that does a visual color change while counting down and while ticking off the ticks by calling blocks sent by the insantiating objected.</description>

Driving Mr Van with Colleen and my family, we arrived at a place where we had just been druing thew inter. In winter the stream had lights and snow and looked quite different from no lights and no snow version as it was now. Colleen commented on that and I was like, &amp;ldquo;yeah that was a once in a lifetime opportunity because I&amp;rsquo;ve heard they&amp;rsquo;re not going to do the lights next year.</description>

hanging out with Trent Reznor of nine inch nails (still?), I got to really ask him and hear some of his thoughts about stuff. I was like &amp;ldquo;oh I know what I can tell you that&amp;rsquo;s personal, different than just &amp;lsquo;omg I love your music&amp;rsquo; which is true, or I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be here now, but I feel sad that I didn&amp;rsquo;t try to engaage you personally earlier.</description>

Hi Laura!!
You were in my dream last night! We were at a party; I think it was my birthday. Thanks for coming!! You were standing a bit away from the party fracas, so were the first person I saw when I came in. I was so happy to see you!! We kissed a little bit and then you were like, &amp;ldquo;okay, that&amp;rsquo;s enough, thunder buns&amp;rdquo; and then I woke up.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve nearly finished the basic memory game where people try to find pairs of cards on the screen. I am able to turn all the cards over with the touch of a button, and can ensure pairs of cards are displayed on the screen, and detect matches and remove them from the table if they match. This is thanks to Ray Wenderlich&amp;rsquo;s Snap! example, on his site.</description>

Outside a large shopping mall, I was riding my bicycle searching for a specific store or searching for Fred to help him find the store or books that he wanted to find. I wanted to change some parts of the mall to make it easier for blind shoppers to navigate safely around; there were some unnecessary cubs and I considered ways to make them elsewhere so the traffic flow would be revitalized for the good of all the shoppers, bt then I noted that shopping is not for the good of the people but for the good of the economy which is for the good of the bankers and held back on doing any more shopping supportive activities</description>

In a large store room with lots of old articles and stuff, I was talking to a young woman who had lived and played there for some years / her whole life. I found that I could hang from the ceiling slats that were spaced enough apart to get my hands between, so I was walking myself from beam to beam, suspended by my fingers. I was surprised at how well I could do it, and she joined me, and kinda chased me around on the ceiling as we walked our hands around hanging from the ceiling.</description>

With peeps from PB, walking along a seashore at the bottom of a relatively steep rocky face, not steep enough to be a cliff, but about 60 degree descent, but upon which were many people sitting enjoying the water, including families and dogs and kids, we were at the top , and I had been sweeping sweeping inside the house, debris had collected from the night before as the garage door was ajar (from the bottom) and pine needles had been blown in.</description>

2:51am Thursday 10 January 2013 as I write this. Just now about to go to bed after chatting with Lin a bit about the best way to get Ma and Fred to Shinagawa station. She wanted to rent a car to Shinagawa, but I think a simple taxi ride one way to Kawasaki will be faster and cheaper overall.
Chatted with Fred at the monthly apartment while he packed.</description>

Today we went to Tokyo Skytree! We had to reserve tickets a month in advance. Only problem was we had made the reservations for tomorrow! Derp!
I don&amp;rsquo;t know how we got into our heads today as the date, but the tix are for tomorrow. Lin, Ma, and Fred will go while I&amp;rsquo;m at work.
My ticket can be used within 30 days of its original date, so we might give it to A-san Su when he comes later this month.</description>

Lin, Ma, and I went to a university library where we were looking for books or something. I saw Christine and helped her find a book (which was unavailable ever since a KTRU dj had mentioned its greatness on the air). Christine needed the book for a report due in April, but the book cost $91 so she wanted to borrow it from the library.</description>

Fred, Ma, Lin and I went across the river to play with the RC helicopter Lin got for me. Success: it&amp;rsquo;s still flyable after a full battery cycle! The packaging says it will fly for about 10 minutes on a single charge. I got to fly it first, and the wind blew it pretty far away (as it flew up up up up) and to bring it down before hitting the highway, I nearly plummeted it down like a fragile plastic rock and broke the case of the camera, plus the shell of the copter.</description>

OMG this is so amazing!!!
First, it&amp;rsquo;s amazing that I can listen to KTRU at all on this fancy series of tubes called the internizz. Second, Fred and I were listening to the Vinyl Frontier&amp;rsquo;s Christmas show a couple nights ago; fun times. but that&amp;rsquo;s not why I&amp;rsquo;m writing.
It&amp;rsquo;s amazing that MK Ultra show is still kickin&amp;rsquo; it. I enjoyed listening to the whole 3 hours played by Dijon, so I called him near the end just to say HI and what&amp;rsquo;s up from Tokyo, etc.</description>

Lin has &amp;ldquo;always&amp;rdquo; wanted to travel and see other parts of the world.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m still not quite great with the caretaking. For example, when I came up to the table to just sit, they were like, &amp;ldquo;do you want sushi? do you want rice? do you want cake? which do you want?&amp;rdquo; and I was like, &amp;ldquo;no thanks&amp;rdquo; and then boom a plate appeared and food that I didn&amp;rsquo;t want was presented.

Went to Paola&amp;rsquo;s home party with several other people there, baking cookies and yummy stuff. I was helping Paola slice bread and put butter on it. She was stabbing the loaf with the knife instead of slicing with the knife, and it seemed to get a bit dangerous so I stopped holding the loaf until she was done. I pulled some first pieces off the loaf to put butter on them, and went to get the butter then came back and couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the slices where I put them.</description>

I was talking to Kellie, and was now about the same age as her. We were in a military installation or at least a government building, and I wanted to go outside, so I asked if she would show me the area.</description>

      <description>##21:53 Saturday 15 December 2012
Just leaving Charu&amp;rsquo;s house after an afternoon of sewing there. Lin made a bunch of owls for people, and I made a dog for her mom. Made with love, but nothing technically amazing; they&amp;rsquo;re just 2D pillows.
I was gonna work on 楽しい英語, but got so tied up sewing, I just sewed instead. The seams seemed like a good thing at the time.</description>

Today at the iOS meeting, Tonny gave a presentation on LLDB, Yi gave a presentation on iOS 6 Constraints, and Tracey gave a case study of customer service prowess.
I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to Matt&amp;rsquo;s iOS classes starting in January. He said he wants to start with &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rsquo;s really going on under the surface of Xcode,&amp;rdquo; an idea I heartily agree will help me figure out wtf is going on half the time with Xcode.</description>

I imagine if Apple had kept Google&amp;rsquo;s original map app, Google wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have utterly redesigned its new map app, which is beautiful. Thanks to HN, I found Sacha Greif&amp;rsquo;s nice writeup on Google&amp;rsquo;s map app.</description>

At the airport waiting for Lin to arrive, I saw a pregnant woman walking by and thought she was Lin. &amp;ldquo;woah, she&amp;rsquo;s showing a lot more than I expected!&amp;rdquo; Then I realized Lin is not pregnant so that couldn&amp;rsquo;t have been her. We got in the van driving home in Texas, and I remembered the time that Sabina had been at the airport but couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember the way home so stayed there all day until we got back.</description>

The big thing about which I&amp;rsquo;m super impressed: she just applied for a new job &amp;hellip;. in Thailand!! Wow! She&amp;rsquo;s always wanted to travel, and I&amp;rsquo;ve always said, &amp;ldquo;so when are you going to do it?</description>

The AB project has classes I created a year ago, at which time were the next iteration of our in-house framework. Six months ago we created the next iteration, which handles multi-lingual sites a bit more elegantly.
So now the AB project&amp;rsquo;s front end will be using the new classes while the back end is still on the old classes. But the front end has some classes in the back end so they can make updates to the public facing site.</description>

Lin and I were traveling with my dad; we were in a hotel with nice view overlooking a neighborhood. I was looking out at the neighborhood overhearing the neighbors playing in the pool. Lin was facing the other direction which surprised me because my dad was in the same room, though he was sleeping. My dad&amp;rsquo;s brother/friend came in and said he was going camping with his friends and we were like, &amp;ldquo;cool&amp;rdquo; and then he left.</description>

This is a view from inside the hole I&amp;rsquo;m digging as part of a Minecraft art project I&amp;rsquo;ve got in mind. I plan to put a stop-action animation of the hole being dug on youtube. Earlier, while researching stuff for work, I found bigdinosaur.org, on which a blog entry was posted about something work related. mySQL or Javascript or some such. Anyway, in the side bar he mentioned he liked Minecraft.</description>

Kris was a repeat GET teacher on PB49th voyage; we hung out in Le Havre, France with Francois, Dave, and Kuni, enjoying wine and cheese and lovely architecture. She just Skyped me out of the blue this morning (and by this morning, I mean 4pm Monday night, due to time zone differences), and by she skyped me, I mean her nearly-2-year-old daughter Skyped me!
We chatted a bit; her friend Luke from 47 is in town from OZ for a week.</description>

Lin and I watched the Kill Bills today. She enjoys movies a lot; one of her ways of enjoying them is falling asleep in front of them. Apparently she had seen the opening scene of Kill Bill, but didn&amp;rsquo;t remember any of the rest.
I prodded her awake as needed and she quite enjoyed the movies!</description>

Making the reporting system for AB, I&amp;rsquo;ve got backbone driving the data to the server with each change made by the user.
User can click [buildings] or [units] button to add where components to the search. The buttons will create a select list with all the fields of that table, plus save the where component to disk.</description>

We ate, stayed up late, woke up late, had fruit smoothies, then joined the dogs for a walk in Yoyogi Park.

I don&amp;rsquo;t know who Ashely is, but she had great reviews, so I sent her $10, my grandparents names on both sides of my family, and she got to work. For an extra $10 per search, she&amp;rsquo;ll send all the images and sources she finds during the process.</description>

Lin was typing a password or something into a computer, but it kept rejecting what she typed.

She kept typing the same (wrong) thing and was getting more and more frustrated that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t working.

Sitting with two of Andy&amp;rsquo;s long-time friends, I got to hear how he became associated with the Pink Cow. He had been working in a bar serving beer when a guy noticed how precisely Andy served the beers, taking great care that each one was optimally poured with a perfect foamy head that just crested the top of the mug. The guy asked Andy if he could mix drinks as well.</description>

I know how to spell your and you&amp;rsquo;re.
I often see things like &amp;ldquo;your stupid&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;stay in you&amp;rsquo;re mom&amp;rsquo;s basement&amp;rdquo; in stupid comment battles. Each time, I wonder if I can think of a sentence where either word could be used while keeping the sentence grammatically correct.
This is quickly foiled by a large difference in the grammatical usage of the words.
&amp;ldquo;Your&amp;rdquo; is your basic possessive pronoun.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s been a struggle, but if we keep this up, I can only imagine it will get easier, and I&amp;rsquo;ll look back and think, &amp;ldquo;man, what was I thinking??&amp;rdquo;
Right now, we&amp;rsquo;ve got three apps in the app store: Mike&amp;rsquo;s English available outside Japan, and 楽しい英語 and 読み書き英語 inside Japan. The apps are similar, but the ones in Japan contain a bit of Japanese content, and are geared more towards Tariq&amp;rsquo;s book, which is not yet available in the US.</description>

      <description>##19:42 Friday 07 September 2012
Time to harass Chase again for their crappy password policies. I asked them why they only allow 32 character passwords. &amp;ldquo;Are you storing them in plaintext?&amp;rdquo; And why don&amp;rsquo;t they allow special characters in my password? &amp;ldquo;Are you afraid of SQL injection?&amp;rdquo;

Their reply included this gem.
&amp;ldquo;As a security measure, we do not include special characters for user ids and passwords.&amp;rdquo;
WTF?
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure where to start, but I think I&amp;rsquo;ll start looking for another bank.</description>

      <description>##01:59 Monday 06 August 2012
Lin chose to stay at home partially because Sabina wanted to go to a bug museum, er house, er shop in Nakano called Mushisha. We found a different bug shop on the same street, which was easier to find; I expect it&amp;rsquo;s trying to get foot traffic of people who can&amp;rsquo;t find Mushisha.
Sabina was all excited and begged me to let her buy one, but I was like, &amp;ldquo;you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to take it to the US,&amp;rdquo; and she&amp;rsquo;s like, &amp;ldquo;well, will you take care of it for me after I leave?</description>

Lin and I had great fun yesterday with Sabina, including:
1) Sabina repeatedly saying, &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s so cooolll!&amp;rdquo; as she found another cool bug/insect/arthropod/critter walking among the wet leaves in Meiji-Jingu

2) Finding funny Engrish in the shoe shop where Sabina tried on some green sandals.

Koko took the same elevator as me yesterday; I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen her in a couple weeks, so I was like, &amp;ldquo;HI!&amp;rdquo;
Turns out she takes the same train line as me, so we walked to the station together. Her parents are in town to see their first grandbaby. Happy times!</description>

This may just be some nicely written copy, but I have a feeling that Meteor will be a game changer for the web.
================================================
We&amp;rsquo;re happy to announce that we&amp;rsquo;ve arranged $11.2 million in funding for Meteor&amp;rsquo;s continued development. The money is now sitting in the bank account of Meteor Development Group, a company controlled by the project founders.
$11.2 million is a lot of money.</description>

I have SSD (512GB) and 16GB RAM on my new MacBook Pro, but still, Finder seems to take its sweet time to do some things. Why??
Also, why does Xcode suck so much? It&amp;rsquo;s seems completely buggy, especially compared to other Mac applications.</description>

Moe and Joe are the names of two race horses in a long joke I used to tell in YRUU. It includes the line &amp;ldquo;moe joe moe joe moe joe moe joe moe joe&amp;rdquo; several times in the joke.
I think Lin and I used &amp;ldquo;moe, joe, moe, joe&amp;rdquo; as a sort of chant while hiking up Mt Fuji, and it came to mean something was challenging or disliked.</description>

HI Apple
I was looking forward to getting support on my new MBP, but when I tried to log in to one-to-one on Firefox, I get the message that I must use Safari.
Is there a workaround for this? Is Apple only targeting Firefox? I can open the same link in Chrome, but how long until you block Chrome as well?
It seems like Apple is trying to boost Safari market share with some freedom-revoking business practice.</description>

 I really appreciate that posterous makes it easy to post text and images to my wordpress installation on my website robnugen.com, and my accounts on facebook.com, posterous.com, plus a link on twitter.
But I don&amp;rsquo;t really like not have tighter control of the HTML/CSS used to create entries.
 Lin and I have been married for a year and 8 days. It&amp;rsquo;s been quite lovely, and opposite one of the comics at the recent Mad Cows Comedy at The Pink Cow (which is moving to Roppongi soon), I do wake up each morning going, &amp;ldquo;yes!</description>

Josh and Amy are two of Lin&amp;rsquo;s friends from work; they started around the same time as she did, so they&amp;rsquo;re all mates. We all went to The Pink Cow last night, for Josh&amp;rsquo;s and Amy&amp;rsquo;s first and first visits, respectfully.
It was Body Works Night, featuring live painting, live body painting, about eight belly dancers, three Cuban dancers, and live music.
The Cuban dancing was new to me, and the most interesting, with bright blue and bright burnt orange flowy puffy dresses, plus a guy half naked and sweeping the air and his back with a broom made of thin sticks.</description>

The bankers from the Lehman Brothers movie I watched last night were all put onto a plane and given neckties for their meeting, but as it came time to land people noticed the neckties were too small and wondered what they were for. I noticed the plane was heading straight for a wall and realized they were safety harnesses and those people who knew how to use them could survive the impact of the wall and the plane.</description>

Walking by Traci&amp;rsquo;s bottle shop, which is closed on Sundays, I saw a kid go into the shop. I knew he wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to hurt anything, but just needed aplace to sleep, but I wanted tomake sure so I went in after him.
He had set up a barrier of bottles as alarms so that people couldn&amp;rsquo;t get to where he was without the bottles banging together to alert him.</description>

At work recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing code that writes code based on files templates and database structure for the objects in the system. Basically this will allow me to just define the database tables and then run a process to write the CRUD code for those tables.
But this just isn&amp;rsquo;t any old CRUD. The CRUD includes being able to merge records that were duplicated in the system.</description>

Lin and I both really loved the movie; she loved it so much that she almost stayed awake through the whole thing! We both thought the lead actress was incredibly attractive; I love her eyes, nose, freckles, smile, and apparent personality! I thought she looked familiar last night, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t place her.
https://www.jinni.com/person/zooey-deschanel/ reminds me that I saw her in Hitchhiker&amp;rsquo;s Guide To The Galaxy. A-ha!</description>

The bicycle parking lot near our house is a tower thing with a door on the bottom. Put bicycle in slot, push button, and a gripper thing comes out, takes the bicycle into the elevator, goes up and places it somewhere. When I come back with my card, the machine remembers where it put my bicycle and retrieves it. Nice system cause the bicycle stays dry and I don&amp;rsquo;t have to lock it.</description>

I made Lin join me playing in the typhoon. She put on flipflops and a raincoat over her stretchy pants. I put on a pair of swimming trunks and nothing else, though I did put a towel in our mailbox for our return.
Went to the river and splashed around in the water on the sidewalk. Rode an abandoned bicycle a bit but left it there because it was happy.</description>

Today I posted a pic of me with a tiger tail for a moustache on Android chat on Stackoverflow because Graeme wondered what I looked like. This led to a chat full of win, and I posted a screenshot of it on my wiki.
https://robnugen.com/wiki/Times:2012-june-17_hilarious_moments_in_https://chat&amp;hellip;.
Therefore I found my wiki entry of Lin,
https://robnugen.com/wiki/Peeps:Lin
and realized I&amp;rsquo;ve not touched my wiki in some time.. So I updated pics of Alex for his 1+ year birthday https://robnugen.</description>

That&amp;rsquo;s a weird title I think, but that&amp;rsquo;s what came out through my fingers.
(TL;DR version at the bottom)
For a long time I have thought about what it means to be alive, why we are alive, etc.
At first, around high school age, I determined that emotions are an important part of why we&amp;rsquo;re alive. For what other reason would emotions become &amp;ldquo;lodged&amp;rdquo; in our bodies until we experience them, unless they&amp;rsquo;re important?</description>

Sweet! I stepped barefootedly onto the Tokaido line and saw Michael Q Todd standing right there! https://xeeme.com/michaelqtodd
He&amp;rsquo;s just back from 14 months on The Gold Coast of OZ, and will be finishing his new book soon after doing a speaking tour overseas.
We were both headed to Shinagawa, and I detected some free time in his schedule so suggested he get a hug from AMMA, right across the street from the station.</description>

My friend Jon &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s Missing Here&amp;rdquo; W first told me about Amma; he had gone to hug her when she visited Tokyo a few years ago. I had seen the posters, but ignored it as inconsequential to my life.
Amma is a spiritual master who gives darshan through hugging. And when Paola told us a few weeks ago that she&amp;rsquo;d be here again (turns out she&amp;rsquo;s in Tokyo every year), I was like, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m there, dude,&amp;rdquo; even though I wasn&amp;rsquo;t yet there and Paola isn&amp;rsquo;t a dude.</description>

My latest SE question:
https://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/149806/seeking-simple-ios-clas&amp;hellip;
In my first iPhone project, I&amp;rsquo;ve got this code essentially repeated in several places across my few classes:
// taken from https://ipgames.wordpress.com/tutorials/writeread-data-to-plist-file/ NSArray *paths = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES); NSString *documentsDirectory = [paths objectAtIndex:0]; NSString *path = [documentsDirectory stringByAppendingPathComponent:filename];  Obviously I don&amp;rsquo;t want to repeat this code all over the place. I think I should create a nice little class to return a full path given a filename and one of the four storage types (&amp;ldquo;Critical&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Cached&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Temporary&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Offline&amp;rdquo;) listed in Data Handling Categories</description>

I just posted this on programmers.stackexchange.com
Back in university, we were able to print &amp;ldquo;unlimited&amp;rdquo; printouts on wide fanfold paper, (perhaps 128 characters wide or maybe more). I could then unfurl the printed code out across the desks or the room and get a great overview of my code, draw circles and arrows and a paragraph on each one in the wide margin, see if this code matched that code, tweak variable names by seeing their brethren, etc, and I loved it.</description>

Summary: it was cloudy only during the eclipse. Other than that, there was only a thin veil of clouds before and after the eclipse.
Travis and I had fun chatting outside on his balcony though. (we were going to go hiking to see the eclipse from a nearby mountain hill, but I chose to cancel it when I saw how overcast it was.

But, before crashing, the app sends to posterous server, &amp;ldquo;hey I&amp;rsquo;m about to send you some data for Rob&amp;rsquo;s journal! Here it comes!&amp;rdquo; and then the app crashes and the server is like, okay I got it!</description>

Lin and I just sat on the couch together while watching High Fidelity, starring Jack Black and the Cusacks. (I love that they&amp;rsquo;re siblings.) I had always wanted to see it but hadn&amp;rsquo;t until tonight. She still hasn&amp;rsquo;t seen it due to her ability to sleep through movies on the couch with me.
I really liked it! John Cusack&amp;rsquo;s character, Rob had a similar transformation as me, Rob.</description>

Wow this voice recognition thing is pretty cool and iPhone. I was able to write a pretty long message to my friend one sentence at a time.
The above two sentences I wrote in one go by saying period in between each one.
Right now I&amp;rsquo;m at the last artist way meeting of Spring 2012. We&amp;rsquo;re about to leave in 15 minutes I think.
So I&amp;rsquo;m just testing on my iPhone and write in journal entries.</description>

I was really moejoe (*) on my way out of the house today, but the weather was optimal and I had told myself I would do it on such optimal days, so I turned right to go over the bridge to Tokyo instead of left down the street to the bicycle parking garage.
The first few turns are easy though I thought I might have missed the fifth turn until I saw its landmark, a post office that means veer left here.</description>

So I got the keyboard and re-offered it to the guy this morning at 9am.
He wrote back at 10am to say yes, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t get the email until nearly 8pm when I got home!! I was checking my email all day; ask my brother! Ask my boss! Ask Colleen!! so freakin&amp;rsquo; weird.
I offered to meet him at Kawasaki station this weekend; I hadn&amp;rsquo;t really had plans to go up to Tokyo, but if he really wants it, perhaps he doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to wait until Monday.</description>

      <description>##17:26 Friday 20 April 2012
I just saw a file named underscore.js and thought of you.
Once the initial fame wears off, we can release a new one:
How do you spell backspace?
B A C K backspace K S P A C E
Then there&amp;rsquo;s the remix version, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think Gmail allows emails more than 100 MB.</description>

      <description>##20:35 Thursday 19 April 2012
I&amp;rsquo;ve had a semi-forgotten bluetooth wireless keyboard in a box by my desk for over a year. I decided to post a message to Toyko Freecycle to see if anyone wanted it.
One guy replied &amp;ldquo;is it bluetooth?&amp;rdquo;
One woman replied, &amp;ldquo;I want it.&amp;rdquo;
I replied &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;where are you?&amp;rdquo; respectively.
They replied, &amp;ldquo;I want it&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Meguro&amp;rdquo; respectively.
I replied &amp;ldquo;sorry it&amp;rsquo;s taken&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;see you soon&amp;rdquo; respectively.</description>

      <description>##19:58 Tuesday 10 April 2012
I was going to do some iPhone dev when I got home, but suddenly got into journaling.
 Lin and I are married, living in Kawasaki, overlooking Tamagawa into Tokyo. We can see Tokyo Sky Tree from our window.
 The wind can see us pretty well through the window, given that it has a nice view of our building from over the river.
 Lin&amp;rsquo;s mom lives with us, though is on a schedule about 4 hours earlier than ours, so we don&amp;rsquo;t get to hang out too much.</description>

      <description>##19:09 Tuesday 10 April 2012
Today at work I modified the way pickups are stored in the system. According to the original specs, it seemed likely that we&amp;rsquo;d only need to have a comma separated list of units per user, but now they want to ensure that units are not deleted if they&amp;rsquo;ve been picked up by anyone in the system. So instead of tokenize and scan all the results, I can just ask the DB if the unit is in the pickups_2_units table.</description>

Lin has been wanting to do this for a while, and I declined because I thought the phone calls would stop, but today my stalker called four (4) times between 9:19pm and 9:25pm, leaving three voice messages consisting of just slight microphone rustly noise for a totaly of about 2.5 minutes.
The police were like, &amp;ldquo;aight so what do you want?&amp;rdquo;
and it was decided that Lin will write an email in Japanese asking her to stop and desist, and one of the officers called her to report the reporting of her behavior.</description>

Played Change today at Artists Way class. The game is a specialty of Soness&amp;rsquo;s and I was playing quietly at first until she challenged me and I just let go and jumped over tables, rode her skateboard to the wolf&amp;rsquo;s demise and had a nice reconnection with the energy of me, Fred, Peter, and Katie back when we had a VHS recorder and an apartment to ourselves.</description>

Tariq came over to chat with me about some app ideas he has. Even more fun than that was hearing him and Lin talk about working at Gaba back in the day; they know a lot of the same people though they didn&amp;rsquo;t know each other at the time.
And, Lin made yummy veggie stew and potato salad for us!
We&amp;rsquo;ll hopefully hang out a bit more often now that we both live in Kawasaki.</description>

Stayed at Ippeki Sou near Ippeki Ko last night. Ippeki is a name that might mean First Blue&amp;hellip; Sou means house. Ko means lake.
We went with her aunt and uncle who said the place was nice this time of year, just before sakura blossoms so we had the place to ourselves. Lin and I got to enjoy the hot bath together, and I was going to go back to the onsen late at night when it would be nearly pitch black, but at 2am or so, all tucked in bed, I woke up and thought, &amp;ldquo;this is my chance,&amp;rdquo; but didn&amp;rsquo;t take it.</description>

Traveling by car in Japan often sucks. The running joke is that everyone tries to go to the same place at the same time. Today, everyone is headed to Ito.
We&amp;rsquo;ve been driving for 3.5 hours, and gone 60 miles. Here&amp;rsquo;s a little hint of the traffic we&amp;rsquo;ve been in for a while.
Super thanks to Lin&amp;rsquo;s uncle for driving so we can sleep in the back!</description>

Super great to see her and her lovely smile! She&amp;rsquo;s been in Okinawa and Hokkaido for some months during the winter; I really admire her traveling lifestyle.</description>

Today at work I fixed a bug, thankfully found a worse bug before putting the
fix online, and did some semi-new development regarding building fine grained user permissions on their website.
The new system allows unlimited permission groups which the code can check before displaying a given page. With a bit more coding (and another table), I can allow them to actually specify exactly which directories a user is allowed to access.</description>

Nice to have my stack of redmine tickets only increase by 4 after our meeting today, instead of 18 or so after last two meetings.
Two were easy to fix bugs, and one is a quick request; the other is a bit more involved, and steps into a realm I hadn&amp;rsquo;t considered: reporting on internal user activity.
I look forward to whittling the list down to nothing.</description>

I dreamt you were riding your bicycle back to the park and an obscured log stopped your front tire, but not the rest of you nor your bike. You scraped your right forearm pretty well, but otherwise were fine-oh-fine.
In other news, I&amp;rsquo;m on Reading Deprivation Week of Soness&amp;rsquo;s The Artist&amp;rsquo;s Way course with Lin, so I can write, but not read your answer until Wednesday.</description>

Today we came home a bit early and met Mama at the new bicycle parking place to scope it out. I had a bad feeling about it because it&amp;rsquo;s basically a machine that takes one bicycle at a time. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to queue up for even a minute to put my bicycle in the machine. Plus it&amp;rsquo;s further away than where we can park now, so I was like, ermmmmm.</description>

Hmm!! Very interesting! My angels say &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s all good&amp;rdquo; though my mind+ego wonders+hopes there&amp;rsquo;s some exciting events.
I look forward to sustainable fuel sources being used soon thereafter!!</description>

Except for a tragically obvious misspelling, the English on the front page of this nationally distributed paper is perfect.
I really wonder how this got approved.</description>

Though not the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve ridden along Tamagawa, it&amp;rsquo;s the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve ridden next to it while not on my destination to anywhere in particular, well, except for this bridge.

Along the way, I saw a building under construction, though it was on pause for the weekend.

And saw some RC cars sliding around some pylons
And saw some bats being swung around some little kids</description>

I tried to move my furnace to expand the size of my burrow&amp;rsquo;s main room, and saw a weird error come up when it normally would have said &amp;ldquo;furnace unregistered.&amp;rdquo;
[LWC] Internal error. Notify an admin immediately. :BLOCK_BREAK
I was like &amp;ldquo;wut&amp;rdquo; and then I was like, O.o, and then I was like lol omg
The admin shrugged and was like ? when I told him, and life moves on.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been using git for over a year, and I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed its awesomeness more and more as I use it. In the past couple of weeks, I&amp;rsquo;ve made great use of git reflog, which keeps steady track of all the changes that affect the files.
Usually I use it to reset my local workspace to the last point at which I uploaded all the files to the live server (which isn&amp;rsquo;t yet using git; we&amp;rsquo;ll fix that next week).</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m up to &amp;ldquo;Latin Lingo&amp;rdquo; by Cypress Hill in my alphabetical tune fest. When they did a shout out to Ralph M the Mexican, I remember that Everlast shouts him out as well on &amp;ldquo;All my Love&amp;rdquo; by House of Pain.
So anyway, I looked him up on YT and found this vid of him just screwing around, but in a totally dope way.
Notice why the video is paused at 1:25.</description>

Lin and I put together a table from a kit we got at Ikea yesterday. There was actually one (pair of) mistake(s) in the kit, but otherwise it was super simple to make.

In the US I got my CDs back from Fred (for $100; he paid me $100 dollars for them when I left for Japan in 2003), though I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet imported them all into my library as my home computer&amp;rsquo;s CD drive is useless as a CD drive.</description>

Our apartment overlooks Tamagawa (in this case, &amp;ldquo;gawa&amp;rdquo; means river), which, here, divides Tokyo and Kanagawa. We have a pretty good view into Tokyo, and can even see Tokyo Sky Tree, right in the middle of this first pic (taken with my iPhone on max zoom)

The view boasts the river, Keikyu Daishi train line (red train between us and the river), and two JR lines crossing the river (Keihin Tohoku and Tokaido):</description>

As Fred noted some time ago, I haven&amp;rsquo;t been writing in my journal much recently. I blame it on having just been too dang busy at work for my own good. I have neglected amazeaweek.net, meditation, my marble track, and The Pink Cow.

I haven&amp;rsquo;t, however, really neglected Minecraft recently. It has swallowed a lot of my time, but oh-my-gosh does it tap into some childhood dreams!</description>

      <description>14 Sept 2016 Just found this README.TXT in a repo on robnugen.com. Repo is now moved to github
29 September 2009 JST I&amp;rsquo;m Rob Nugen, and have kept a journal since 1987. Before YouTube, before LiveJournal, before &amp;ldquo;blog&amp;rdquo; was even a word, I started posting my journal online at https://robnugen.com/cgi-bin/journal.cgi This was basically an index into a directory of files with a structure like YYYY/MM/DDfilename.html It could handle digging down into the tree of files, but not really jumping to adjacent directories.</description>

Several journal entries are on my computer at my house. They&amp;rsquo;ll flood my website as soon as we get a dial tone!
Life without email seems just as hectic as life with the extra requirement to dig through all the spam, all the &amp;gt;&amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; forwards, all the email crap I get. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I want the stuff that is funny.</description>

      <description>I found it! This is my beautiful description of what journal.cgi does:
It reads files in the /journal directory (and below) allowing users to read through various items. It allows me to just write a journal entry and drop it into the pile; I don&#39;t have to update the index. It uses CSS to give an aesthetically pleasing look to each entry with minimal HTML code written in each entry.

      <description>Catching Up
Thursday 10 September 1998
Yes, I haven&#39;t written in a while. Sigh.. Sometimes I feel so bogged down and I have so much fun stuff to write!! Tulsa Rally was last weekend, dinner at Niko Niko&#39;s was last night, and I&#39;ve had lots of anti-fun with my scanner not working! But I&#39;m here on campus at UH again; just ate lunch and said HI to Nikki and Sara and am about to go to Scholars&#39; Community where I used to work on campus.</description>
