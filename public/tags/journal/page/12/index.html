<p>This is a view from inside the hole I&rsquo;m digging as part of a Minecraft art project I&rsquo;ve got in mind.  I plan to put a stop-action animation of the hole being dug on youtube.  Earlier, while researching stuff for work, I found <a href="https://www.bigdinosaur.org/">bigdinosaur.org</a>, on which a blog entry was posted about something work related.  mySQL or Javascript or some such.  Anyway, in the side bar he mentioned he liked Minecraft.  Hmm!  I also kinda want to have my server available on the world wide interwebs, but I don&rsquo;t really wanna pay a monthly fee to do it.  Maybe a group of us could all pitch in.  hmm.</p>

<p>So sad that it&rsquo;s all closed source, but I just pushed the first version of the reporting system to our client&rsquo;s admin site.  It uses backbone to do most of its goodness, including: add fields for filtering, add fields for output, run the report, and copy the report for more reporting fun!</p>

<p>Kris was a repeat GET teacher on PB49th voyage; we hung out in Le Havre, France with Francois, Dave, and Kuni, enjoying wine and cheese and lovely architecture.   She just Skyped me out of the blue this morning (and by this morning, I mean 4pm Monday night, due to time zone differences), and by she skyped me, I mean her nearly-2-year-old daughter Skyped me!</p>

<p>We chatted a bit; her friend Luke from 47 is in town from OZ for a week.  Nice to reconnect with old friends.  :-)</p>

<p>Lin and I watched the Kill Bills today.  She enjoys movies a lot; one of her ways of enjoying them is falling asleep in front of them.  Apparently she had seen the opening scene of Kill Bill, but didn&rsquo;t remember any of the rest.</p>

<p>I prodded her awake as needed and she quite enjoyed the movies!</p>

<p>Hi Rob,</p>

<p>I noticed you&rsquo;ve shared Grooveshark (<a href="https://grooveshark.com/">https://grooveshark.com/</a>) on this page <a href="https://robnugen.com/blog/2012/11/22/digging-through-tutorial/">https://robnugen.com/blog/2012/11/22/digging-through-tutorial/</a>, as you are no doubt aware, Grooveshark actually closed down back in 2015.</p>

<p>We’ve put together a guide to the best alternatives in 2017. Here’s the link - <a href="https://comparitech.net/limewire-grooveshark-alternative">https://comparitech.net/limewire-grooveshark-alternative</a></p>

<p>Perhaps you could update your page to include a link to our guide so that anyone still interested in Grooveshark has an alternative.</p>

<p>I hope this helps.</p>

<p>-Anthony</p>

<p>I wish I could show the code I wrote, but I can show <a href="https://jonahlyn.heroku.com/blog/2011/12/02/backbone-drag-and-drop">Jonahlyn&rsquo;s backbone drag-and-drop tutorial</a> from where I got ideas for the drag and drop part.</p>

<p>Making the reporting system for AB, I&rsquo;ve got backbone driving the data to the server with each change made by the user.</p>

<p>User can click [buildings] or [units] button to add where components to the search.  The buttons will create a select list with all the fields of that table, plus save the where component to disk.  When the select field is selected, it changes to the name of the field + an operator dropdown + an empty field, then writes the field selection to disk.  When the operator is selected, it gets written to disk.  When the user enters data in the field, it gets written to disk.  When user sorts the where components, the changes are written to disk.</p>

<p><a href="https://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a>, I think I love you.</p>

<p><strong>update 5:39pm</strong></p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m starting to look at <a href="https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette">Marionette</a>.  I found a <a href="https://davidsulc.com/blog/2012/05/06/tutorial-a-full-backbone-marionette-application-part-1/">tutorial on Marionette</a>; apparently it can make a <a href="https://davidsulc.github.com/backbone.marionette-atinux-books/#search/Neuromarketing">neat little bookshelf webapp</a>.  As I start digging into the tutorial, <a href="https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/38073/is-there-a-cdn-for-backbone-marionette">I wonder if there&rsquo;s a CDN for Marionette</a>.</p>

<p>We ate, stayed up late, woke up late, had fruit smoothies, then joined the dogs for a walk in Yoyogi Park.</p>

<p>I found a fiverr gig that got lots of rave reviews.  Ashley <a href="https://fiverr.com/tn5rr2012/trace-your-family-tree-for-you-and-go-back-4-generations">will start your family tree for you and go back 4 generations for $5</a>. I don&rsquo;t know who Ashely is, but she had great reviews, so I sent her $10, my grandparents names on both sides of my family, and she got to work.  For an extra $10 per search, she&rsquo;ll send all the images and sources she finds during the process.</p>

<p>My lovely dear <a href="https://laura.chinet.com/oldindex.html">Laura Wallace</a> helped me get started with genealogy (with <a href="https://www.whollygenes.com">The Master Genealogist</a>  (TMG)) back in the day.  That software is only available for Windows, so I recently installed an ISO of windows XP in <a href="https://virtualbox.org">Virtual Box</a>, loaded a 30 day trial of TMG and updated my 10+ year old data to the new TMG format.</p>

<p>I was thinking of just using TMG in the Windows window of my Mac, but searched around and found two (of many!) Mac options that I considered using.  The first was Family Tree Maker by ancestry.com.  I was just about to buy (into its) advertising, when I decided to do a bit more digging.  It seems that ancestry.com is the Blob that Ate Free Genealogy sites, with its many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestry.com#Other_sites">acquisitions of formerly free services</a>.</p>

<p>Then I found <a href="https://familysearch.org">Family Search</a>, which is free!  There&rsquo;s a Mac version of <a href="https://www.ohanasoftware.com">FamilyInsight by Ohana Software</a>, which costs $25 (per year I think), but even if it&rsquo;s per year, it&rsquo;s 1/10th the price of ancestry.com&rsquo;s option.</p>

<p>Apparently ancestry.com has a huge database of names and sources, but I think I&rsquo;ll be quite fine for a while on familysearch.org.</p>

<p>Lin was typing a password or something into a computer, but it
    kept rejecting what she typed.  I noticed that she hadn&rsquo;t read
    all the instructions at the top of the page so I told her to
    read them first.  She kept typing the same (wrong) thing and
    was getting more and more frustrated that it wasn&rsquo;t working.  I
    kept getting more and more frustrated that she wasn&rsquo;t listening
    to me.  I yelled at her, slid my hands across all the keys to
    write crap data into the password field, all just to get her
    attention.</p>

<pre><code>The waiter next to us was surprised, and I said &quot;I'm sorry; I 
have an issue of getting super angry if people don't listen to 
me; it's not her fault but I take it out on her.

I started to do some kind of self-healing to release the anger, 
and during that process, I woke up,

<p>I woke up realizing that I can do a bit better and be less angry if Lin misunderstands or otherwise seems to not listen to me.</p>
