<p><em>In a military built facility, there was a door designed for entry only, but from previous experience, we knew it would be more efficient to just go out the in door than to go around to the designated out door.  However, this time when we went out the in door, we were suddenly in a room 20 yards back from where we thought we&rsquo;d be. I was like, &ldquo;?&rdquo; and then went through the proper out door and we all got into the group again..  I asked others if they noticed anything weird while coming out of the facility.  Three of us agreed on the same experience.  I confronted one of the technicians there. &ldquo;Is there a teleporter in the facility?&rdquo; and she directly lied and said NO.  I was like, &ldquo;okay, has anyone else expressed the same thing that we did: they were unable to go out the in door because they were shifted backwards in the facility?   She said yes, because that question is one they hadn&rsquo;t been told they must lie about.</em></p>

<p><em>ah ha! we thought.  What a prefect way to test the technology for mass consumption to see if it can be safely used on people!</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still not quite great with the caretaking.  For example, when I came up to the table to just sit, they were like, &ldquo;do you want sushi?  do you want rice?  do you want cake?  which do you want?&rdquo; and I was like, &ldquo;no thanks&rdquo; and then boom a plate appeared and food that I didn&rsquo;t want was presented.</p>

<p>Um.</p>

<p>I noticed how spoiled the kids are. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s just <em>these</em> kids, but I&rsquo;ve heard rumors and anecdotal evidence that it&rsquo;s like this for many Japanese kids. Every whine, pout, request, was immediately pandered. Ugh.</p>

<p>We can&rsquo;t touch the 9 month old baby without washing hands first. Why? Don&rsquo;t we want to build up his immune system?</p>

<p>When the 2 year old was trying to pull Lin&rsquo;s iPad away from the 6 year old who had been playing with it, I saw them doing a little tug of war. I was like, &ldquo;false,&rdquo; and simply removed it from the realm of possibility.</p>

<p>Playing hide and seek with the kids was fun, reminding me of Fred and I playing hide and seek.  But I was bemused by how entertained they were with so few places to hide.  I mean, there were three places to hide:  (kneeling under the table, standing on the lee side of a shelf, and standing behind the door of the room).  Anywhere else would be immediately visible when someone entered the room.  I showed them a fourth place to hide, made by moving the very light couch a bit forward and lying down behind that.</p>

<p>I found an excellent hiding technique which I wasn&rsquo;t able to implement: climb over a counter and through the door to the next room (which was blocked by the counter).  I couldn&rsquo;t use it because the room into which I would vanish was adjacent to the waiting area used by people before trying to find the hiders.  Hmm.</p>

<p>I wore shoes today (for the first time since May *) because it was cold, and wet, <em>and</em> I have three (3) skin splits (as opposed to shin splints?) on my left foot. My right foot is fine.</p>

<p>(* except for the day I went to get my visa, and two days I went to meet my client for business meetings)</p>

<p><em>Went to Paola&rsquo;s home party with several other people there, baking cookies and yummy stuff.  I was helping Paola slice bread and put butter on it.  She was stabbing the loaf with the knife instead of slicing with the knife, and it seemed to get a bit dangerous so I stopped holding the loaf until she was done.  I pulled some first pieces off the loaf to put butter on them, and went to get the butter then came back and couldn&rsquo;t find the slices where I put them.  I realized they were under two to her slices that Paola must have stacked up on top of those.  I put them onto some foil to put them in the ofyen and Carla came in and was like, &ldquo;mmmmm&rdquo; and then I tolde her that&rsquo;s margarine, not butter and she was like, &ldquo;awwww&rdquo; and we were thinking about Carla&rsquo;s veganism and then I realized people were calling Paola &ldquo;Jane&rdquo; and as people in the other room were silent, Paola went in and said, &ldquo;you guys go ahead; I can&rsquo;t make it&rdquo; because there was too much work to do in the kitchen.  They were like, &ldquo;oh it&rsquo;s no problem,&rdquo; but some people thought it was an issue of Paola&rsquo;s perfectionism that made her not take on some large projects like building a tour through an abandoned village in a cloud forest through which we were now walking with Carla.  I climbed down the steps, testing out the rope to see if it would hold if people fell off the green mossy covered wooden stairs down which I was walking.  It held me just fine, and I turned the corner at the bottom of the stairs and found the guys were unfurling a long blue hose about 15 inches in diameter all the way down another staircase.  They inflated the hose with a fan at the top and we could slide down the hose without injury and with great speed.   The first guy tried it, but there wasn&rsquo;t enough pressure in the hose so his butt kept hitting the stairs.  I was like, &ldquo;more pressure&rdquo; and the guy turned on the fan a bit hired and then the guy on the stairs went whooosh down and hit his head on the top ridge of the tunnel near the bottom.  Oh crap, sorry, I thought cause he was too far away to hear.  The next guy went down with less incident, and then came back up using the air pressure as a rocket of sorts.  I saw the guy who hit his head and I apologized, but he said it was no problem.   I woke up before I got to slide down.</em></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to have Carla and Paola in the same dream so soon after I found out they both know Jana, whose name is similar to &ldquo;Jane&rdquo;</p>

<p>because Monday is a holiday, I figure my brain will need some notes to reload its current state.  Some notes on my desk point to a URL that will result in the notes here, spewed out by code in progress:</p>

<pre><code>in code above line 64, we need to fill in the default email 
from site_text factory (into array shown below)




Array
(
    [renter_id] =&gt; 23
    [to_name] =&gt; doug e fresh
    [to_email] =&gt; doug@e.fresh.net
    [subject] =&gt; These properties may be of interest
    [body] =&gt; data from site_text factory goes here
    [from_name] =&gt; Rob Nugen
    [from_email] =&gt; robnugen@company.co.jp
)




above is info from set 1
</code></pre>

<p>after save, display the email_set template or an error message. this will be the initial data entry for admin (but is now broken because template is trying to read data from DNE variables). we HAVE NOT sent the email yet</p>

<p>when admin enters data, need to figure out how to deal with new record (I think the sent_email class will create new record just fine)</p>

<p>now once data is POSTED by admin, we will be in section above marked with HAPPY NEW MAYAN CALENDAR</p>

<p><em>Looking at some notes, I found a cryptic word like Pinecal, and then Obreil.  With those, I was able to look up online that they&rsquo;re putting together a property in Hawaii!  Awesome!  Just as I was looking away from the notes, I heard her behind me, &ldquo;is someone off the list?&ldquo;  I was caught looking where I shouldn&rsquo;t have been looking.  I didn&rsquo;t lie; I just said &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; and then she lied for me so no one else would know.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re on the list; I love J-pop!!&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>I was sent back in time from the present era to about 30 years ago, and saw my friend Kellie who I hoped could help me.</em></p>

<p><em>I was talking to Kellie, and was now about the same age as her.  We were in a military installation or at least a government building, and I wanted to go outside, so I asked if she would show me the area.  She took me out onto the grounds of the building and was showing me stuff.  I interrupted her a bit when I thought we were far enough away so they couldn&rsquo;t hear.</em></p>

<p><em>I faced toward her and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to hug you and make it look like we are kissing or something, but don&rsquo;t get the wrong idea; I need to  tell you something, &rdquo; I said as I put my head on her shoulder, huggingly.</em></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;What year is it right now?&rdquo; I asked.</em></p>

<p><em>She goes, &ldquo;1978.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Okay, somewhere on the planet, I&rsquo;m 8 years old. &rdquo; I intended to tell her this so she&rsquo;d be read for the rest of what I wanted to tell her: I&rsquo;ve been sent back in time to prepare us to be prepared to record by multiple camera angles the World Trade Center destruction of the first building that was hit by a plane, and for more recording equipment to be placed in the building preceding and during their destruction.</em></p>

<p><em>But she couldn&rsquo;t handle the idea that I had been sent from the future.. she pushed me back out of the hug and was like, &ldquo;what?  no way; you&rsquo;re trying to trick me,&rdquo; etc and  I was like, &ldquo;no no for real,&rdquo; etc and the scene changed and I was listening to another idea for how to have the survelleince be done, under the guise of preserving some historic homes along the river.  Some antique houses had been falling into the river through neglect, and we were going to fund a stludy on how to evaluate their condition and see which ones could be restored to their original pristine state.</em></p>

<p><em>We showed video of a house falling into the river; it was a blue 3 story house, but only one room on each story, so quite tall and narrow.  A homeless person had moved in, and the weight of him walking around had unsettled the building.  It tipped over into the river.</em></p>

<p><em>A guy was explaining something about the train tracks, and had taken the train lines apart at a seam but then the train came so he had to quickly bolt them back together.  He got the rails reconnected but they were quite out of alignment for that section and I was afraid the train would derail, but it sped through the section unscathed.  I was helping him put the rails back to their original straightness when I woke up.</em></p>

<p>Just leaving Charu&rsquo;s house after an afternoon of sewing there.   Lin made a bunch of owls for people, and I made a dog for her mom.  Made with love, but nothing technically amazing; they&rsquo;re just 2D pillows.</p>

<p>I was gonna work on 楽しい英語, but got so tied up sewing, I just sewed instead.  The seams seemed like a good thing at the time.</p>

<p>Today at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/TokyoiOSMeetup/">iOS meeting</a>, Tonny gave a presentation on LLDB, Yi gave a presentation on iOS 6 Constraints, and Tracey gave a case study of customer service prowess.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to Matt&rsquo;s iOS classes starting in January.  He said he wants to start with &ldquo;what&rsquo;s really going on under the surface of Xcode,&rdquo; an idea I heartily agree will help me figure out wtf is going on half the time with Xcode.</p>

<p>I imagine if Apple had kept Google&rsquo;s original map app, Google wouldn&rsquo;t have utterly redesigned its new map app, which is beautiful.   Thanks to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN</a>, I found <a href="https://sachagreif.com/design-details-of-google-maps-for-ios/">Sacha Greif&rsquo;s nice writeup on Google&rsquo;s map app</a>.</p>
