<p>2:51am Thursday 10 January 2013 as I write this.  Just now about to go to bed after chatting with Lin a bit about the best way to get Ma and Fred to Shinagawa station.  She wanted to rent a car to Shinagawa, but I think a simple taxi ride one way to Kawasaki will be faster and cheaper overall.</p>

<p>Chatted with Fred at the monthly apartment while he packed.  When I Quit and Saved a Copy of the Minecraft Pocket Edition map from his phone to mine, the basement and one wall of our house was missing.   0.5.0 beta so I guess we came across a bonus bug.  We considered saving the files directly, but I was like, &ldquo;nah it ain&rsquo;t worth it.&rdquo;  You gotta pack and we gotta wake up and go to work/airport tomorrow.</p>

<p>I carried home the heater Paola and Jon gave to us.  It&rsquo;s a liquid-filled radiator, so pretty heavy.  I used the same plastic twine stuff: two lines each double looped around nice round parts of the heater and the longer one over my shoulder and the shorter one in my hand, both with padding from the toilet seat cover / lid cover that are coming home as well.</p>

<p>Paola and Jon had us all over for dinner today: lovely fresh salad, lovely yummy rice-shaped pasta with chicken, and incredible desserts from Taiwan.  Paola had just gotten back from doing a vipassana course in Taiwan, which featured some food shopping after the course.</p>

<p>Today at work I was doing tests after <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14211281/how-to-daemonize-a-php-script-to-be-run-with-upstart">daemonizing the mailer</a>; I want to make sure it doesn&rsquo;t send double emails if multiple scripts are running at the same time.   But it sent several duplicate emails, moe joe.</p>

<p>Oh, and I came across <a href="https://thinkup.com">thinkup</a> today.  I think I&rsquo;ll install it on my domain.</p>

<p>I found an slow, but easy way to close redmine tickets.   Today I asked about some that have been lingering from the beginning of the project, and Shirata-san said those features are no longer needed.  Nice(?)</p>

<p>Today we went to Tokyo Skytree!   We had to reserve tickets a month in advance.   Only problem was we had made the reservations for tomorrow!  Derp!</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know how we got into our heads today as the date, but the tix are for tomorrow.  Lin, Ma, and Fred will go while I&rsquo;m at work.</p>

<p>My ticket can be used within 30 days of its original date, so we might give it to A-san Su when he comes later this month.  Not sure yet.</p>

<p>So, instead of Skytree ascent, to Asakusa&rsquo;s shopping street we went.  Fred and I had gone yesterday with his friend Hiroshi (and Hiroshi&rsquo;s wife Masae), for Fred&rsquo;s first, and my second stroll down that street.  The most utterly packed shop yesterday was also packed today: the deep fat fried sweet yum yum shop had three registers, each with a line of about 3 people.  Fred said, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re making them and selling as fast as they can, and they can&rsquo;t sell them fast enough [to keep the line down].&rdquo;</p>

<p>We ate at a dessert shop on Orange Street.  It wasn&rsquo;t as ample as I had hoped, but my ice cream was served in a bowl suspended in a larger bowl of water with dry ice in it.</p>

<p>Weather got a bit chilly, so we were on the way home by 5:15pm, nearly 24 hours since Fred and I had met Hiroshi and Masae there the previous night.</p>

<p>Lin, Ma, and I went to a university library where we were looking for books or something.  I saw Christine and helped her find a book (which was unavailable ever since a KTRU dj had mentioned its greatness on the air).  Christine needed the book for a report due in April, but the book cost $91 so she wanted to borrow it from the library.</p>

<p>It was time to go, but we couldn&rsquo;t find Lin.  I was looking around for her in the crowds of people chilling in the park-like atmosphere of the university campus.  I saw Fred had just arrived and was like, &ldquo;yo have you seen Lin?&rdquo; but he had not so I was like, &ldquo;moe joe where is she?&rdquo; and then I realized I hadn&rsquo;t checked my phone.  I checked and she had listed out all the reasons this is a bad relationship, in some sort of free-form brainstormed list.</p>

<p><code>this is a bad relationship!</code></p>

<p>first the gasoline
then the rice
nb kind of kid</p>

<p>somehow I am passing
my accounting class</p>

<p>yay</p>

<p>no thanks to you</p>

<p>And I started to cry and I slid the phone to my mom, &ldquo;I found Lin,&rdquo; but she didn&rsquo;t hear me. moe joe, so thankful to wake up!</p>

<p>Fred, Ma, Lin and I went across the river to play with the RC helicopter Lin got for me.  Success: it&rsquo;s still flyable after a full battery cycle!   The packaging says it will fly for about 10 minutes on a single charge.  I got to fly it first, and the wind blew it pretty far away (as it flew up up up up) and to bring it down before hitting the highway, I nearly plummeted it down like a fragile plastic rock and broke the case of the camera, plus the shell of the copter.</p>

<p>It didn&rsquo;t work afterward, but then it started to work again; it seems to take its time before it wants to start again.</p>

<p>Lin seemed to fly it the best, with Ma a close second.  She landed it in the tennis court area, so I got to climb up and down the fence (and used the steps of the referee seat to climb down/up on the inside).</p>

<p>There was a guy out there with a &ldquo;sport kite,&rdquo; which had two strings on each side.  He had been using it for 10 years, and could do some neat maneuvers with it.  Fred got to play with the kite a decent amount of time and was able to control it a bit by the end, including launching it upside down from the ground.</p>

<p>OMG this is so amazing!!!</p>

<p>First, it&rsquo;s amazing that I can listen to KTRU at all on this fancy series of tubes called the internizz.   Second, Fred and I were listening to the Vinyl Frontier&rsquo;s Christmas show a couple nights ago; fun times.  but that&rsquo;s not why I&rsquo;m writing.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s amazing that MK Ultra show is still kickin&rsquo; it.  I enjoyed listening to the whole <a href="https://noise.rice.edu/ktru/sheet.nsf/15aa60c8727df106802568e90056b4d1/9b62ecd77c6ac6e386257ae300124f48?OpenDocument">3 hours played by Dijon</a>, so I called him near the end just to say HI and what&rsquo;s up from Tokyo, etc.  We chatted for a bit, mostly me asking what had changed and what has stayed the same at the station in all those years since I was there.</p>

<p>He ended his shift with a song by an artist from Tokyo, then he closed his show with something like, &ldquo;yeah that was <artist name> all the way from <strong>Japan</strong>,&rdquo; giving just a bit of emphasis to the final word so I knew he was saying HI to me.</p>

<p>I called <em>back</em>, and the next DJ (TomZ) answered.  &ldquo;Dijon?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No he&rsquo;s in the other room; how can I help you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I just wanted to thank him for the shout out to Japan; I called him from Tokyo a second ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!  You&rsquo;re the Tokyo guy! hang on&rdquo;</p>

<p>I held; I said thanks to Dijon and got his IM address.   Moments later, via text message, Dijon assured me I should listen to the next DJ, TomZ.</p>

<p>3:01 PM dijon: sup rob, thanks for listening tonight. the dude who&rsquo;s on now is crazy&hellip; i&rsquo;d keep listening for a minute if you&rsquo;re able.</p>

<p> me: With that invitation, how can I resist?? ;-)</p>

<p>  Thank you for playing even while having a bit of a cough&hellip; keeping the music moving!</p>

<p>3:02 PM if you&rsquo;re still in the staiton[sic], tell him I&rsquo;m still listening. :-) yes, he sounds a bit crazy!</p>

<p>3:04 PM dijon: tom&rsquo;s chill. i gave him the message and he threw his hands in the air in an expression of pure joy</p>

<p>After that, things went a bit crazy.</p>

<p>TomZ came on the air between songs like, &ldquo;thanks for listening Thunder Rabbit! All the way from Tokyo.  By the way, I don&rsquo;t know if you remember, but I used to rollerblade with you back in the day, so anyway, thanks for listening&rdquo;</p>

<p>WHAT?????   Holy cats my brain was like WHAT??  How can he remember that?  How can I remember him??  I met so many people inline skating&hellip;   But Google has the memory of a massive computer brain so (while Tom was playing some noise music,) I looked it up, and found <a href="https://robnugen.com/cgi-bin/journal.pl?type=skate&amp;date=1995/01/20">a skate entry, at the very bottom of which is Tom&rsquo;s name.</a></p>

<p>While texting Tom that journal entry, plus &ldquo;my wife doesn&rsquo;t like this noise music haha,&rdquo; he was on air again, confirming my previous &ldquo;WHAT&rdquo; message with, &ldquo;yeah, back in the day, we met while skating, and I was like, wow that&rsquo;s cool.. and&hellip; life goes on,&rdquo; and while he was speaking, more brain cells started to wake up in my brain, &hellip; &ldquo;he sounds like that guy who ran for City Council!  What was his name???&rdquo; and I text <em>that</em> to him, and I was right!</p>

<p>He laughed, like, &ldquo;heh.  Yeah.  Back in 19__ I ran for City Council At Large position #4, and got 19,474 votes which was 18% of the vote that year&hellip; &ldquo;  etc, &ldquo;so maybe some memories are happening..  Oh, and hi wifey who doesn&rsquo;t like noise music!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing this since then so haven&rsquo;t written back, but I&rsquo;ll send him the link right &hellip; now.</p>

<p>PS: TomZ, Lin says HI!</p>

                        <p>##06:27 Tuesday 25 December 2012</p>

<p>Lin and I have been talking a lot about her plan to live/work in Thailand for a year.</p>

<p>Being apart for an extended time will be hard; I know!  I see it as an extension of our relationship into a new realm.  What&rsquo;s it like to be together and be apart for a decent bit of time?</p>

<p>Lin has &ldquo;always&rdquo; wanted to travel and see other parts of the world.  That&rsquo;s exactly how I came to Japan, and gave up a whole life with great friends and great Wende to do it.   Even when I found another great life with janette, I was like, &ldquo;yeah, no&rdquo; I can&rsquo;t settle here, all the way up in Dallas, when the original goal was <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> way around the world.   When janette dropped me off at the airport, it didn&rsquo;t hit me until I went through the gate.  Boom crying like a baby &ldquo;what the hell am I doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I got on the airplane having never been to Japan, hardly knowing the language (still don&rsquo;t, considering how long I&rsquo;ve been here.  Sorry, old Rob), and I remember how fucking hard it was to have no physical contact once I got here.  I got trolly comments on my journal when I was just wanting a hug.</p>

<p>So, I know it will be challenging, and I also know it will be growth.  For both of us, but especially for Lin.  She&rsquo;s wanted to travel for years but hasn&rsquo;t; she&rsquo;s been taking care of her family over taking care of her own dreams.   It will be growth for me and my desire for hugs.  Maybe I&rsquo;ll buy a (few) FREE HUGS t-shirt(s) to wear around town.   Maybe I&rsquo;ll spend more time in meditation to activate my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kundalini">kundalini</a>, instead of having all this energy in lower chakras.</p>

<p>I think of the whole experience as divine spiritual growth for each of us and both of us together.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ve mentioned, but the first time I washed Lin&rsquo;s back, I had a brief experience of déjà vu, &ldquo;wow; Lin and I have done this before!&rdquo; So I know we&rsquo;ve had at least one other incarnation together, and I suppose many many many incarnations together.  In this one, while we&rsquo;re deeply in love, we are planning to be physically apart for a bit.</p>

<p>My part includes maintaining my job and this apartment where Lin can come back anytime.  Her part includes releasing everything so she can live alone for the first time in her life.</p>

<p>I got up this morning thinking I should get some Thai flash cards for Lin, so I&rsquo;ll look for some now.</p>
