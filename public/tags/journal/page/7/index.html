<p>The most interesting difference I noticed between my preparation for TJ Bike trip to Kyoto and Sarah&rsquo;s preparation for <a href="https://www.sarahouten.com/">rowing and cycling around the world</a> was that I had none and she had lots.</p>

<p>I might learn something from that.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://dendory.net/blog.php?id=511ecb55">https://dendory.net/blog.php?id=511ecb55</a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m cross posting this here because it&rsquo;s ironic to do so</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There had been rumors around the web, but now it&rsquo;s official, <a href="https://blog.posterous.com/thanks-from-posterous">Posterous is shutting down</a>. For those who don&rsquo;t know, Posterous is a Tumblr competitor, a place people used to blog, and a few years back there was no saying which of the two would emerge as the leading platform. Ever since Twitter bought them however, it became obvious that Posterous was losing, and today they confirmed that the whole service is shutting down very soon.</p>

<p>This is particularly ironic since in its early years, Posterous billed itself as the <a href="https://blog.posterous.com/make-the-switch-to-posterous">place to move to from other dieing services</a>, and now they are the ones biting the bullet. So what this means for millions of blogs is that they will have to transfer their data to a new service, but most likely more critical, that their space on the web will need to change. This means changing links, losing any previous SEO, and starting anew.</p>

<p>This is a great reminder of why owning your online presence is so important. Just a year ago few would have been able to predict Posterous would not last, just like now people post on Tumblr, Facebook, Twitter and so on, without any concept of how long their content is going to be around.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Own your domain name.</strong> If you want to post content, anything more substantial than cat pictures, things you may want to come back to in the future, you should own your domain name. It&rsquo;s cheap and ensures that your links won&rsquo;t have to change even if you need to move to a new platform. Then, once posted on your own space, you can share links to Twitter &amp; co.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Use services that have open APIs.</strong> If you post content on a host that has no content export policy, then you are basically throwing that effort into a black hole. The instant that they shut down, you might lose it all.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Use these concepts for anything of importance that you do online.</strong> There are rumors that Google might one day shut Google Reader down, do you have your feeds exported as an OPML file? Do you periodically download your email using IMAP from your web mail service? Do you have your calendar and contacts synced to a local machine?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I feel for Posterous users, but for now this is also a reminder for the rest of us.</p>

<p>Our new friend Jana happens to live in the same neighborhood as Lin&rsquo;s old high school friend Mikako!  Tonight was the night we all met at 6pm in Jiyugaoka for sushi at a 回転すし restaurant and then for a drink and ice cream covered hand made donuts at a shop that Mikako likes.</p>

<p>Talked about Jana&rsquo;s <a href="https://tourdafrique.com/tour-overview/?t=tour-dafrique">Tour d&rsquo;Afrique</a> experience, Paola&rsquo;s yoga classes (three of us know each other through Paola), my under-construction app, Jana&rsquo;s school (where Mikako used to attend), our love of animals, etc etc blah blah, and generally enjoyed a lovely time.</p>

<p>Lin and I &ldquo;babysat&rdquo; for her sister&rsquo;s daughter Mikako, nicknamed Mikarin. We played memory with a full deck of cards and each won once. We played Othello twice (Mikako beat me, then I beat Lin). Lin took a nap; we all ate cake.</p>

<p>Then when Baba got back to the house, we ate at the smokey restaurant and then Lin and I went home.</p>

<p><em>Dusk was approaching on a rainy night and we got a knock at the door. I opened it and a western looking guy wearing a backpack introduced himself. &ldquo;HI; I&rsquo;m Joe from Nagano,&rdquo; and I interrupted him, &ldquo;you came from Nagano??&rdquo; &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. &ldquo;Okay sorry please continue..&rdquo; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m was working in IT there but lost my job so I&rsquo;m looking for IT work in Tokyo..&rdquo; He was dripping a bit with rain, so I offered him to come in. He stepped up onto the wooden entry and I said &ldquo;shoes off outside, please&rdquo; and he stepped back outside. I then said &ldquo;wait. I don&rsquo;t personally have work for you, but I have a contact who might. You look cold, so I&rsquo;m offering to give you a warm place to sleep for tonight, BUT there is still some light outside; you can push on and maybe find a job, or you can come inside; it will be dark in about 30 minutes; you can come back after visiting a couple more houses.</em></p>

<p>He considered the options for a minute and then came inside. I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Rob and this is Sabina,&rdquo; as Sabina came up to see the visitor. She&rsquo;s traveling as well so may be able to give a few tips on making money in Japan.
Sabina started asking him questions animatedly, and they hit it off right away. She took him into her room and closed the door; I could hear them talking as I started doing dishes, washing a large tray with a painted tree on it, actually a large tree in a forest of trees, with lots of green deep green with some of the paint chipping off. I started to scrape more paint off while washing and thought I should have gotten back in touch with Sabina sooner because now she&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;m just getting back to her because she has a new friend and she&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;m jealous. But really I&rsquo;ve wanted to get back in touch the whole time but just didn&rsquo;t know what to say. So I made a decision to talk to her as soon as possible when she came back out of her room and then I woke up.</p>

<p>Tariq and I are creating a game of memory for iOS. This is my first project that uses blocks, and I must agree, they make coding a lot lot easier!!</p>

<p>This is my second big iOS project, a lot of which is based on <a href="https://twitter.com/mhollemans">Matthijs Hollemans</a>&rsquo; game <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/12735/how-to-make-a-simple-playing-card-game-with-multiplayer-and-bluetooth-part-1">Snap</a> (currently without the multiplayer stuff), one of <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/tutorials">Ray Wenderlich&rsquo;s excellent tutorials</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve just gotten the in-game tutorial to work, though its alignment&hellip; isn&rsquo;t. Yay for blocks and tutorials and screenshots!</p>

<p><em>Was in south pacific island and was admiring the piercings of some of the locals.  An older guy held two needles in a downward non-threatening way and nodded his head toward me questioningly.  I was like &ldquo;sure!&rdquo; and approached him.  He  quickly and painlessly inserted needles in either side of my upper lip, then out a bit lower, so they didn&rsquo;t actually pierce into the mouth; just like subcutaneous, but not deeper than that.</em></p>

<p>Today at Tariq&rsquo;s we worked about 4 hours so he bought pizza. Apparently this company is going to put ovens in the delivery vehicles so the pizza cooks <em>on the way</em> to the destination.</p>

<p>He made smaller icons for the menu and I incorporated them. Between arriving home and going to his house, I fixed the timer in each round. At his house, I added a ScoreView based on UILabel.</p>

<p>Things to do include:</p>

<p>Lin&rsquo;s uncle was here this weekend, and he planted the seed of moving to Taiwan instead of Thailand.  I&rsquo;ve never been, but I understand many Taiwanese are super friendly and outgoing, plus the weather is nice and warm.</p>

<p>Lin will look into visas and stuff soon.  yay!!</p>
