<p>Josh and Amy are two of Lin&rsquo;s friends from work; they started around the same time as she did, so they&rsquo;re all mates. We all went to The Pink Cow last night, for Josh&rsquo;s and Amy&rsquo;s first and first visits, respectfully.</p>

<p>It was Body Works Night, featuring live painting, live body painting, about eight belly dancers, three Cuban dancers, and live music.</p>

<p>The Cuban dancing was new to me, and the most interesting, with bright blue and bright burnt orange flowy puffy dresses, plus a guy half naked and sweeping the air and his back with a broom made of thin sticks.</p>

<p>Delicious burritos and goldrush brownies and extra ice cream. Great to see Traci, and excited to hear that The Pink Cow is moving to Roppongi soonishly! They&rsquo;ll certainly get more walk-in traffic who will enjoy the delights of The Pink Cow!!!</p>

<p>Here in our office, Yama is interviewing a couple of guys about some DJ mixing equipment. I don&rsquo;t really know much other than that, but it&rsquo;s a bit of a change from the normally silent office.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on loading and saving objects with an optional one-to-one relationship. Unfortunately my logic is buggy so I will probably have to step away from the keyboard and figure out a reasonable way to do this.</p>

<p>One way to do it includes duplicating a lot of code, but I won&rsquo;t do that; grrrr.</p>

<p>Our app was rejected by Apple because it&rsquo;s &ldquo;primarily a video.&rdquo; We had based it off National Film Board Canada&rsquo;s app which basically just plays videos. I hope they&rsquo;ll accept it.</p>

<p><em>The bankers from the Lehman Brothers movie I watched last night were all put onto a plane and given neckties for their meeting, but as it came time to land people noticed the neckties were too small and wondered what they were for.  I noticed the plane was heading straight for a wall and realized they were safety harnesses and those people who knew how to use them could survive the impact of the wall and the plane.  The impact seemed imminent, but the plane slowed down due to mud on the runway and stopped short of the wall, and we all got out, but were surrounded by exo-political military forces because we had landed on an airstrip normally reserved for alien craft which could land vertically and didn&rsquo;t mind having a wall in the middle of the runway.  They all had guns so we explained that we were from earth, and they were like, &ldquo;we know who you are, now get out of here and take your plane with you,&rdquo; but no one knew how to fly the plane as the pilots had jumped out before the landing.</em></p>

<p><em>Walking by Traci&rsquo;s bottle shop, which is closed on Sundays, I saw a kid go into the shop.  I knew he wasn&rsquo;t going to hurt anything, but just needed aplace to sleep, but I wanted tomake sure so I went in after him.</em></p>

<p><em>He had set up a barrier of bottles as alarms so that people couldn&rsquo;t get to where he was without the bottles  banging together to alert him.  He had his body outlines with bottles and was sleeping ther.  We came in aand he woke up, and I showed him peace sign with two fingrs to tell him not to worry.  He was worried though and tried to leave or explain why we should leave him alone.</em></p>

<p><em>Some guys in a car outside were arguing, and a guy came in to ask if we could help.  I was like well, not really, and oone of the guys in the car shot another guy in the car, killing him.  The guy who had come in was interested in a large machine in the shop, which could monitor nuclear missles around the world and other information that he wanted to monitor.  I said he can use the machine, but he was like, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take the machine,&rdquo; and I go, you mean and bring it back?  and he was like no, and that&rsquo;s when the guy shot the other guy in the car as if to show they were serious business.</em></p>

<p>At work recently I&rsquo;ve been writing code that writes code based on files templates and database structure for the objects in the system.  Basically this will allow me to just define the database tables and then run a process to write the CRUD code for those tables.</p>

<p>But this just isn&rsquo;t any old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a>.  The CRUD includes being able to merge records that were duplicated in the system.  It allows clicking previous and next to see the next record.  Even keeps track of the sort order of the list so when we go back to the list it&rsquo;s sorted as it had been.</p>

<p>And now today I&rsquo;m looking at the field types and displaying the records in different ways depending on the type.</p>

<p>So if it&rsquo;s a field of type text, I display just the first 100 characters.  If it&rsquo;s an image_code, I&rsquo;ll display the image instead of the code.</p>

<p>But first I have to incorporate a bit of Alphonzo&rsquo;s code that I imagine he&rsquo;s going to ask me to add.</p>

<hr />

<p>Also, Happy Burpday Fred!!!!!!</p>
