<p>Sitting with two of Andy&rsquo;s long-time friends, I got to hear how he became associated with the Pink Cow.   He had been working in a bar serving beer when a guy noticed how precisely Andy served the beers, taking great care that each one was optimally poured with a perfect foamy head that just crested the top of the mug. The guy asked Andy if he could mix drinks as well.  Andy was like, &ldquo;I can mix any drink you can name.&rdquo;  The guy named a few drinks and Andy mixed them perfectly, better than the guy had ever previously tasted.  Could Andy cook?  Absolutely; it turns out that Andy&rsquo;s hands have a different DNA than the rest of his body; his hands themselves know how to prepare any dish ever prepared or ever desired.&mdash;-</p>

<p>Why was I dreaming about Andy at <a href="https://www.thepinkcow.com">The Pink Cow</a>?  I guess it&rsquo;s time to go back and check out the new location again!!</p>

<p>I know <a href="https://www.elearnenglishlanguage.com/difficulties/youryoure.html">how to spell your and you&rsquo;re</a>.</p>

<p>I often see things like &ldquo;your stupid&rdquo; or &ldquo;stay in you&rsquo;re mom&rsquo;s basement&rdquo; in stupid comment battles.  Each time, I wonder if I can think of a sentence where either word could be used while keeping the sentence grammatically correct.</p>

<p>This is quickly foiled by a large difference in the grammatical usage of the words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your&rdquo; is your basic possessive pronoun.  Use &ldquo;you&rsquo;re&rdquo; and you&rsquo;re using a pronoun and a verb.</p>

<p>I imagine this difference can be overcome with careful use of <a href="https://www.enchantedlearning.com/wordlist/nounandverb.shtml">words which can be considered nouns or verbs</a>, depending on their usage.  However you&rsquo;re still pretty much left with</p>

<p>Your NOUN</p>

<ul>
<li><p>your dog</p></li>

<li><p>your cat</p></li>

<li><p>your mama</p></li>
</ul>

<p>OR</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re VERBING</p>

<ul>
<li><p>you&rsquo;re dancing</p></li>

<li><p>you&rsquo;re eating</p></li>

<li><p>you&rsquo;re yelling</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You&rsquo;re VERBED (actually I&rsquo;m not sure what these are)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>you&rsquo;re screwed</p></li>

<li><p>you&rsquo;re tired</p></li>

<li><p>you&rsquo;re required</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You&rsquo;re ADJECTIVE</p>

<ul>
<li><p>you&rsquo;re smart</p></li>

<li><p>you&rsquo;re sexy</p></li>

<li><p>you&rsquo;re cool</p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>Hmm, looking a the above, I see some options, but they need punctuative support.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re smart, dog.</p>

<p>Your smart dog.  (could be used as an answer to who solved the crime.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll keep thinking about it&hellip;..</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re smart, leave your suggestions in the comments!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a struggle, but if we keep this up, I can only imagine it will get easier, and I&rsquo;ll look back and think, &ldquo;man, what was I thinking??&rdquo;</p>

<p>Right now, we&rsquo;ve got three apps in the app store:  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mikes-english/id553151517?mt=8&amp;uo=4">Mike&rsquo;s English</a> available outside Japan, and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/jp/app/leshii-ying-yu/id558509841?mt=8&amp;uo=4">楽しい英語</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/jp/app/dumi-shuki-ying-yu/id550411320?mt=8&amp;uo=4">読み書き英語</a> inside Japan.  The apps are similar, but the ones in Japan contain a bit of Japanese content, and are geared more towards Tariq&rsquo;s book, which is not yet available in the US.</p>

<p>Anyway, as I was preparing to upload the new versions, I noted that our little list of apps is slowly growing.  Decided to take a baby photo of our app collection.</p>

<p>Time to harass Chase again for their crappy password policies.  I asked them why they only allow 32 character passwords.  &ldquo;Are you storing them in plaintext?&rdquo;  And why don&rsquo;t they allow special characters in my password?  &ldquo;Are you afraid of SQL injection?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="https://getfile5.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2012-09-07/jBvclFotrcBbyIdHfBkhGFBBFEfbDCEHbdDEgudaFIuEEsqcBEFhBIAACjsp/chase_short_easy_passwords.png.scaled1000.png"><img src="https://getfile2.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2012-09-07/jBvclFotrcBbyIdHfBkhGFBBFEfbDCEHbdDEgudaFIuEEsqcBEFhBIAACjsp/chase_short_easy_passwords.png.scaled500.png" alt="Chase_short_easy_passwords" /></a></p>

<p>Their reply included this gem.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As a security measure, we do not include special characters for user ids and passwords.&rdquo;</p>

<p>WTF?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure where to start, but I think I&rsquo;ll start looking for another bank.  Maybe a credit union or something will have everything I need, and far fewer fees.  Chase has been siphoning $12 PER MONTH so that I can have my money in their account.</p>

<p><strong>1. How do you know you&rsquo;re a Unitarian Universalist?</strong></p>

<p>Raised UU, but I more often say I was &ldquo;raised UU&rdquo; than I say I am currently UU.</p>

<p><strong>2. How do you define Unitarian Universalism?</strong></p>

<p>encouraging others to find their own spiritual path, and speaking out against social injustice.</p>

<p><strong>3. When do you feel most Unitarian Universalist?</strong></p>

<p>age 5 to 20-something</p>

<p><strong>4. If you could design your ideal UU religious community what would congregational life look like? Who&rsquo;s there? What do they do after worship? What does worship look like? When does the congregation meet? Where does the congregation meet? Think even bigger than my questions!</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve filled out everything on the survey and am coming back to this question, with my answer to the bigger question.</p>

<p>I grew up as a UU. I remember being a kid lighting candles at the altar and all that. I became a teenager in 1983, just as LRY had been reborn in YRUU. I went to between 3 and 7 Rallies in Southwest District every year, and there were between 15 and 50 kids at each event. (Rallies are called Cons in other districts.)</p>

<p>I attended rallies until my first year of university; rallies didn&rsquo;t <em>literally</em> save my life, but they saved my sanity; I generally disliked the normal high school experience, except for rallies; they were my safe place to open up. They gave me real spiritual growth.</p>

<p>I have attended several (two hundred?) Sunday UU sermons in my life, but never really really really really liked them. It&rsquo;s just a bunch of intellectual blah blah through which I have gained very little spiritual content / support.</p>

<p>When I graduated from university, I remembered I hadn&rsquo;t been to church in 7 years. I went back and quickly gravitated to being a YRUU advisor; I wanted to give back to the organization that had given so much to me.</p>

<p>For about 5 or 6 years I was advising at church every Sunday locally and advising at every rally within the district; I was on youth council for a year; my number one focus was YRUU. I helped the youth organize Houston Rally about 4 times from 1998 to 2002 I think.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>YRUU is the closest experience I&rsquo;ve had to what I believe is spiritual truth: we are all one. Worship services where we each light a candle, say a few words, and then just BE together. Just sit. Just relax in a puppy pile. You are safe. You are loved. The entire universe is this moment right now. Need to cry? Just cry; we are here for you. Need to shout? Let&rsquo;s all shout; we are here together.</p>

<p>In my humble opinion, the &ldquo;adult&rdquo; sermons are better for those who did not grow up UU. I&rsquo;ve seen many adult escapees from other religions say &ldquo;ah yes; this is more like it,&rdquo; when they come to a UU service. As opposed to where they were raised, the messages at UU services are like, You won&rsquo;t go to hell for breaking the rules; the love is all around you; don&rsquo;t worry be happy.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s great! Those are great messages, but they&rsquo;re only partway to the reality that YRUUers experience at YRUU events. (Note, I say &ldquo;experience&rdquo; at YRUU events, not just &ldquo;discuss&rdquo; or consider in a sermon.)</p>

<p>In a YRUU event, the message isn&rsquo;t just &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t go to hell for breaking the rules&rdquo; but the experience is &ldquo;here we are in heaven already, creating this moment together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The message is not &ldquo;love is all around you,&rdquo; but an experience of &ldquo;you are loved; you ARE love; we are loved; we love and respect ourselves and each other&rdquo;</p>

<p>The message is not &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry; be happy,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s an experience of omg I&rsquo;m so happy I forgot to be worried!</p>

<p>When crappy stuff happens in YRUU, the community is quick to respond with love, &ldquo;yo, that wasn&rsquo;t cool, but we love you; <em>you</em> are cool and don&rsquo;t have to do that to get attention.&rdquo;</p>

<hr />

<p>Rallies had grown to minimum 50 kids at an event to upwards of 200 at a single weekend event when I was an advisor. Unfortunately, around the same time I moved to Japan, there were some JNP-powered campaigns to castrate Southwest District YRUU of its power. These campaigns have largely worked; all the good advisors were pushed out (according to my former-YRUU sources) and YRUU events in Southwest District have been severely limited in quantity and quality.</p>

<p>SO, I don&rsquo;t know if any of what I wrote (YRUU is great) still applies, but I sorta feel like I graduated from UUism via YRUU; adult sermons can&rsquo;t really give me any more than I&rsquo;ve already got.</p>

<p>It ain&rsquo;t UUism&rsquo;s fault; people who weren&rsquo;t raised UU may not be ready for spontaneous puppy piles.</p>

<p><strong>5. Describe Unitarian Universalist congregations in three words:</strong></p>

<p>chatty, happy, encouraging</p>

<p><strong>6. Regarding that congregation thing&hellip; which is true for you?</strong></p>

<p>I used to go, but I don&rsquo;t now.</p>

<p><strong>7. If you have the option of attending a congregation and you do not attend, what keeps you away?</strong></p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t looked to see if there&rsquo;s one here, but see question 4</p>

<p><strong>8. What do you wish UUs in congregations knew/understood about you?</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;d rather spend 15 minutes in a real hug than talk or listen</p>

<p><strong>9. What is your vocation/job? </strong></p>
