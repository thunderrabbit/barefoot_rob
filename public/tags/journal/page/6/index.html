<p><strong>6:42pm Friday 3 May 2013</strong></p>

<p>Chillin&rsquo; with Travis as Yumi and Lin magic up some yummy dinner (some of which was made by Travis).  Deji may be coming over for dinner or maybe after dinner; Travis wasn&rsquo;t able to tell from Deji&rsquo;s email.</p>

<p>Travis made a 3D maze for me!  It&rsquo;s not quite 3D so much as it&rsquo;s layers of 2D.  It&rsquo;s drawn on a hexaflexagon!!!   He used Haskell to output SVG which he printed then folded the maze. Sweet!!</p>

<p>And now, dinner!!</p>

<p>I love how well Lin and Yumi get along.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t like that the URLs in Wordpress don&rsquo;t use the date to help make them unique.</p>

<p>I wonder who bombed the Boston Marathon.</p>

<p>The most fun way I&rsquo;ve found to get a trickle of bitcoins is coinvisitor.com/chat</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m on the train now but may shore up those links in a bit.</p>

<p>Lin and I went to Aruna&rsquo;s house today; Aruna told us about homeopathy and opened the door to a new way of healthiness. Â  I had heard of it, but just thought homeopathy meant eating well, but apparently it&rsquo;s a pretty specific matching of energetic frequencies to facilitate health.</p>

<p><strong>8:29pm Wednesday 10 April 2013</strong></p>

<p>Lin and I were both feeling kinda sick last week. I&rsquo;ve not meditated in a while, though I might start soon. We&rsquo;re feeling mostly better now, but I&rsquo;ve still got some congestion.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s not why I&rsquo;m writing. Lin is talking about starting a diary. I&rsquo;m fully supportive of such things, and hope she gets a lot lot lot and tons of benefit from it. Online or offline is fine; I can give her some tips and encouragement.</p>

<p>My main tip for any kind of diary writing, especially if you wanna do it for a while:</p>

<p><strong>write the full date at the top of every entry</strong>. Or the bottom. Or both. But the point is do NOT just write <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> cause I promise, even if you can be sure you meant April 10th and not the 4th of October, you may be hard pressed to remember the year. And even if <em>you</em> can remember the year, someone who finds the diary after you will <em>not</em> remember the year. I use 4 digits for the year (how shortsighted of me!!!), always write the month out as a word, and almost always write the time as well, including am or pm.</p>

<p>The next most important tip might be the most important:</p>

<p><strong>start writing again if you have a lapse.</strong> And don&rsquo;t try to catch up. In my handwritten journals, I remember having stopped writing because I got all busy. I wanted to write again, but I was like &ldquo;ah crap; how will I write everything that&rsquo;s happened in 4 months?&rdquo; That thought blocked me from writing for a month. Then I was like, &ldquo;oh crap; how will I write everything that&rsquo;s happened in 5 months?&rdquo; <em>That</em> thought blocked me for a month until I realized the futility and just wrote what happened that day. I released the need to write about the prior 6 months and just started writing as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>Other tips that are not as important, but may be useful</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In a handwritten diary, leave a couple pages in front blank to be an index. Â Fill it in with highlights once the book is full</p></li>

<li><p>Every month or year or so, write an overview of your situation. I got the idea from the State of The Union Addresses in the US; I call them State of My Life Addresses.</p></li>

<li><p>Only read old entries if it&rsquo;s been a year since you wrote them. Â Otherwise, don&rsquo;t read; just write.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>6:15am Thursday 28 March 2013</strong></p>

<p><em>Riding in the back of a bus, after there had been a pretty devastating earthquake, but we were still trying to go somewhere, and the driver had to back up a try again to go this way or that way around the city to get to where we were going. Â I was sitting in the back, and Lin was sitting a few seats ahead of me. Â I had the whole back seat to myself and at one point the bus had to bak up and it seemed to tilt a bit precariously, and I was glad no one was in the seat with me because if we tipped over, it would mean they&rsquo;d all fall onto me, or me onto them and it would have been a mess. Â With no one, then I could just stand up on the side of the window Â or something.</em></p>

<p><em>Then there was an older woman sitting next to me and she had also done some classes with Clairvision, so we were talking a bit Â and I showed her a book I was reading, and then the woman across from the table across the table from us was like interesting book and asked if she could look at it. Â When she opened it, a small sponge fell out; apparently it had been inside the book. I kind of remember having putting it in the book, and I could see some of its sides had been damaged from being smushed in the book,but it still had its pyramid shape when unsmashed, Â  There was a pin in it, so I Â tried not to smash it and be pricked with the pin and I warned the woman next to me oh there&rsquo;s a pin, and then I noticed there were a lot of pins, and the woman across the table had a lot of pins in a pin cushion as well. Â I was like, &ldquo;is this yours then? Â and she looked at it like, no it&rsquo;s not mine.. and then another book fell out of the first book; it was an introduction to unitarian universalism, and I handed it to the woman next to me while the woman across the table continued reading the first book.Â </em></p>

<p><em>Then another woman came up and asked &ldquo;for a free reading,&rdquo; which I thought was a bit rude at first, but then noted that she had green ectoplasm just oozing out of her temples, like something had really gone wrong. Â  I wondered if it was real, and the woman next to me said, we&rsquo;re probably seeing some kind of after effect and it may phase in and out of view, a and as the woman was talking her far Â the affected woman was talking her face became like a skull and dry white hair and emaciated gross but still talking and wondering what was happening. Â I sat and tried to maintain composure and then noted her color came back, her hair turned to a healthy black perm and she looked like Julia Roberts with a black perm and she was still talking, and the ectoplasm had vanished and everything seemed a lot better. Then as she began to change back to skeleton ectoplasm straw white hair, I interrupted excitedly, &ldquo;you know what? Â you look just like Julia Roberts! I just realized that&rdquo; and then I thought to myself, &ldquo;oh crud I hope she likes Julia Roberts&rdquo; and the woman goes, &ldquo;really? Â that&rsquo;s so sweet!&rdquo; something something and Â her face kept turning into a skull and grossness and then I woke up.</em></p>

<em>Sho was discussing with Jonas about a new site, and I wanted to work on something but didn&rsquo;t have enough information to get started on my site. Â I tried to get back to work and the scene shifted.</em></p>

<p><em>At our old house again, my mom went outside to sleep in the pullman trailer and I went to my old rom. I heard a noise with sounded like the neighbors pulling trailers around so I went outside to make sure they were only pulling their own trailers. Â the light was on inside but both switches were off, so I tried to turn the right one on, but then just went outside and found my mom reading in the back of a station wagon and she was like &ldquo;I was just reading something you wrote; was this recent or a long time ago? Â you said &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t wat to grow old&rsquo;&rdquo; and I was like, &ldquo;well I can&rsquo;t imagine it was recent; I don&rsquo;t remember it; maybe I was 9 years old&rdquo;</em></p>
