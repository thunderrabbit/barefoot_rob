<p><strong>6:42pm Friday 3 May 2013</strong></p>

<p>Chillin&rsquo; with Travis as Yumi and Lin magic up some yummy dinner (some of which was made by Travis).  Deji may be coming over for dinner or maybe after dinner; Travis wasn&rsquo;t able to tell from Deji&rsquo;s email.</p>

<p>Travis made a 3D maze for me!  It&rsquo;s not quite 3D so much as it&rsquo;s layers of 2D.  It&rsquo;s drawn on a hexaflexagon!!!   He used Haskell to output SVG which he printed then folded the maze. Sweet!!</p>

<p>And now, dinner!!</p>

<p>I love how well Lin and Yumi get along.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t like that the URLs in Wordpress don&rsquo;t use the date to help make them unique.</p>

<p>I wonder who bombed the Boston Marathon.</p>

<p>The most fun way I&rsquo;ve found to get a trickle of bitcoins is coinvisitor.com/chat</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m on the train now but may shore up those links in a bit.</p>

<p>Lin and I went to Aruna&rsquo;s house today; Aruna told us about homeopathy and opened the door to a new way of healthiness.   I had heard of it, but just thought homeopathy meant eating well, but apparently it&rsquo;s a pretty specific matching of energetic frequencies to facilitate health.</p>

<p><strong>8:29pm Wednesday 10 April 2013</strong></p>

<p>Lin and I were both feeling kinda sick last week. I&rsquo;ve not meditated in a while, though I might start soon. We&rsquo;re feeling mostly better now, but I&rsquo;ve still got some congestion.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s not why I&rsquo;m writing. Lin is talking about starting a diary. I&rsquo;m fully supportive of such things, and hope she gets a lot lot lot and tons of benefit from it. Online or offline is fine; I can give her some tips and encouragement.</p>

<p>My main tip for any kind of diary writing, especially if you wanna do it for a while:</p>

<p><strong>write the full date at the top of every entry</strong>. Or the bottom. Or both. But the point is do NOT just write <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> cause I promise, even if you can be sure you meant April 10th and not the 4th of October, you may be hard pressed to remember the year. And even if <em>you</em> can remember the year, someone who finds the diary after you will <em>not</em> remember the year. I use 4 digits for the year (how shortsighted of me!!!), always write the month out as a word, and almost always write the time as well, including am or pm.</p>

<p>The next most important tip might be the most important:</p>

<p><strong>start writing again if you have a lapse.</strong> And don&rsquo;t try to catch up. In my handwritten journals, I remember having stopped writing because I got all busy. I wanted to write again, but I was like &ldquo;ah crap; how will I write everything that&rsquo;s happened in 4 months?&rdquo; That thought blocked me from writing for a month. Then I was like, &ldquo;oh crap; how will I write everything that&rsquo;s happened in 5 months?&rdquo; <em>That</em> thought blocked me for a month until I realized the futility and just wrote what happened that day. I released the need to write about the prior 6 months and just started writing as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>Other tips that are not as important, but may be useful</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In a handwritten diary, leave a couple pages in front blank to be an index.  Fill it in with highlights once the book is full</p></li>

<li><p>Every month or year or so, write an overview of your situation. I got the idea from the State of The Union Addresses in the US; I call them State of My Life Addresses.</p></li>

<li><p>Only read old entries if it&rsquo;s been a year since you wrote them.  Otherwise, don&rsquo;t read; just write.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>6:15am Thursday 28 March 2013</strong></p>

<p><em>Riding in the back of a bus, after there had been a pretty devastating earthquake, but we were still trying to go somewhere, and the driver had to back up a try again to go this way or that way around the city to get to where we were going.  I was sitting in the back, and Lin was sitting a few seats ahead of me.  I had the whole back seat to myself and at one point the bus had to bak up and it seemed to tilt a bit precariously, and I was glad no one was in the seat with me because if we tipped over, it would mean they&rsquo;d all fall onto me, or me onto them and it would have been a mess.  With no one, then I could just stand up on the side of the window  or something.</em></p>

<p><em>Then there was an older woman sitting next to me and she had also done some classes with Clairvision, so we were talking a bit  and I showed her a book I was reading, and then the woman across from the table across the table from us was like interesting book and asked if she could look at it.  When she opened it, a small sponge fell out; apparently it had been inside the book. I kind of remember having putting it in the book, and I could see some of its sides had been damaged from being smushed in the book,but it still had its pyramid shape when unsmashed,   There was a pin in it, so I  tried not to smash it and be pricked with the pin and I warned the woman next to me oh there&rsquo;s a pin, and then I noticed there were a lot of pins, and the woman across the table had a lot of pins in a pin cushion as well.  I was like, &ldquo;is this yours then?  and she looked at it like, no it&rsquo;s not mine.. and then another book fell out of the first book; it was an introduction to unitarian universalism, and I handed it to the woman next to me while the woman across the table continued reading the first book. </em></p>

<p><em>Then another woman came up and asked &ldquo;for a free reading,&rdquo; which I thought was a bit rude at first, but then noted that she had green ectoplasm just oozing out of her temples, like something had really gone wrong.   I wondered if it was real, and the woman next to me said, we&rsquo;re probably seeing some kind of after effect and it may phase in and out of view, a and as the woman was talking her far  the affected woman was talking her face became like a skull and dry white hair and emaciated gross but still talking and wondering what was happening.  I sat and tried to maintain composure and then noted her color came back, her hair turned to a healthy black perm and she looked like Julia Roberts with a black perm and she was still talking, and the ectoplasm had vanished and everything seemed a lot better. Then as she began to change back to skeleton ectoplasm straw white hair, I interrupted excitedly, &ldquo;you know what?  you look just like Julia Roberts! I just realized that&rdquo; and then I thought to myself, &ldquo;oh crud I hope she likes Julia Roberts&rdquo; and the woman goes, &ldquo;really?  that&rsquo;s so sweet!&rdquo; something something and  her face kept turning into a skull and grossness and then I woke up.</em></p>

<em>Sho was discussing with Jonas about a new site, and I wanted to work on something but didn&rsquo;t have enough information to get started on my site.  I tried to get back to work and the scene shifted.</em></p>

<p><em>At our old house again, my mom went outside to sleep in the pullman trailer and I went to my old rom. I heard a noise with sounded like the neighbors pulling trailers around so I went outside to make sure they were only pulling their own trailers.  the light was on inside but both switches were off, so I tried to turn the right one on, but then just went outside and found my mom reading in the back of a station wagon and she was like &ldquo;I was just reading something you wrote; was this recent or a long time ago?  you said &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t wat to grow old&rsquo;&rdquo; and I was like, &ldquo;well I can&rsquo;t imagine it was recent; I don&rsquo;t remember it; maybe I was 9 years old&rdquo;</em></p>
