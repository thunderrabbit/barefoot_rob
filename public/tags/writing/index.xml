      <description>30 September 1997
 Today the president of the corporation that owns my company is coming to visit. They put up a big sign, hollerin&amp;rsquo; a &amp;ldquo;Big Texas Howdy!&amp;rdquo; gag me.  I showed off my project to Leila, who said it looked really good and she was quite pleased and impressed. Yay! She&amp;rsquo;s a manager or something over the group that will be using the application, so I was glad she liked it.</description>
