      <description>06:30 Monday 30 October 2017 JST Wow interesting! Today I thought I had completely missed the express train to Shinjuku (non-stop from my station), misremembering that it leaves at 6:14. But it leaves at 6:21.
The train and I arrived at the station at the same time, but from past experience, not only will all the seats be sold out, there will be a queue of people hoping to buy tickets.</description>
