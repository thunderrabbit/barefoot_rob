      <description>20:16 Sunday 12 August 2018 JST Today Lin and I are at her sister&amp;rsquo;s house, but they do not have strong wifi so I cannot use Skype. At least not in this quiet room. Maybe that is why it&amp;rsquo;s quiet haha.
I do not have unlimited data on my phone, but I do have unlimited calling, so I am doing a lesson via phone instead of Skype.</description>

      <description>15:40 Wednesday 27 December 2017 -02 Lin and I ate lunch with R &amp;amp; D and D&amp;rsquo;s auunt R and three of R&amp;rsquo;s nephews. I took the longest to eat due to chewing chewing chewing. The meat was a bit tough given that we arrived near the end of their lunch session. D drove me, Lin and his aunt R in the Range Rover, while R drove his three nephews in a rental car.</description>

      <description>17:16 Tuesday 12 December 2017 JST I may be speaking too soon, but programming in Godot is so easy I could just cry. (in terms of memory managment, auto completion, and things just working)</description>

I will be presenting at Pecha Kucha on 24 November.
I hate the idea of presenting; part of me wants to cancel everything, but I hope to see some of you on Thursday November 24th at SuperDeluxe in Roppongi.

      <description>##00:54 Friday 28 November 2014 JST##
On my way out of Roppongi, I shook the hands of the various bar managers/owners who said hello, and I took a liking to Ken, who had white hairs in his beard.
He invited me to come up just to see the place so I could come back next time. Okay; that can&amp;rsquo;t hurt, I figured, and followed him up to 6th floor of some building.</description>
