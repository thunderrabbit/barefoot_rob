<p>Today Lin and I are at her sister&rsquo;s house, but they do not have strong
wifi so I cannot use Skype.  At least not in this quiet room.  Maybe
that is why it&rsquo;s quiet haha.</p>

<p>I do not have unlimited data on my phone, but I do have unlimited
calling, so I am doing a lesson via phone instead of Skype.</p>

<p>Lin and I ate lunch with R &amp; D and D&rsquo;s auunt R and three of R&rsquo;s
nephews.  I took the longest to eat due to chewing chewing chewing.
The meat was a bit tough given that we arrived near the end of their
lunch session.  D drove me, Lin and his aunt R in the Range Rover,
while R drove his three nephews in a rental car.</p>

<p>Now, shopping.</p>

<p>I may be speaking too soon, but programming in Godot is so easy I
could just cry.  (in terms of memory managment, auto completion, and
things just working)</p>

<p>Howdy</p>

<p>I will be presenting at Pecha Kucha on 24 November.</p>

<p>I hate the idea of presenting; part of me wants to cancel everything,
but I hope to see some of you on Thursday November 24th at SuperDeluxe
in Roppongi.</p>

<li>Rob</li>
</ul>

<p>In other news, I&rsquo;m planning to present Head Heart and Soul to anyone
who wants a sense of what the men&rsquo;s group work is about.</p>

<p>In other news, I&rsquo;m scheduled to be filmed in mid December for TV show
to air in late December.</p>

<p>I gotta prep and part of me fears I&rsquo;ll sabotage it all.</p>

<p>On my way out of Roppongi, I shook the hands of the various bar
managers/owners who said hello, and I took a liking to Ken, who had
white hairs in his beard.</p>

<p>He invited me to come up just to see the place so I could come back
next time.  Okay; that can&rsquo;t hurt, I figured, and followed him up to
6th floor of some building.</p>

<p>We walked past the doorman and he opened the doors to reveal&hellip; six or
seven beautiful, tall, beautifully dressed women.</p>

<p>Ooops.  I can refuse any amount of drugs or alcohol, but I know my
limit when it comes to women: the sky.  So, I gratefully said &ldquo;thank
you and good night&rdquo; and did a quick 180, hoping the elevator door would
still be open.  It wasn&rsquo;t, so I looked for a staircase, saw none, so
looked for elevator button, saw none, and just about felt panic as Ken
pushed the elevator button for me.  (It was right next to the elevator
where it should be; it just wasn&rsquo;t lit.)</p>

<p>The doors opened immediately (thank goodness), but not before three
girls came asking why I was leaving so soon.  &ldquo;Oh your bag looks
heavy,&rdquo; one said in Japanese; &ldquo;what&rsquo;s in it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I answered, &ldquo;ummm&hellip;&rdquo; (don&rsquo;t say computer; don&rsquo;t say computer) &ldquo;my
coat&rdquo; as Ken answered for me: &ldquo;stuff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They asked a few questions about where I live and why I needed to go
home.  I showed my wedding ring and said &ldquo;I&rsquo;m married&rdquo; and one was
like, &ldquo;oh, but if you don&rsquo;t eat; it&rsquo;s okay&hellip;&rdquo; and I was like, &ldquo;Ooohhh
I see!&rdquo; as the most attractive(*) girl smiled her way into my personal space,
hugging me gently, looking directly into my eyes. Oh goodness that
moment was captivating.  I put my arms around her as well, and put my
chin over her shoulder for a bit more platonic hug.</p>

<p>Okay, this has(n&rsquo;t) gone too far (enough), so I apologized again, and
wanted to say &ldquo;今度&rdquo; (next time) which is basically a polite way of
saying &ldquo;never&rdquo;, but I didn&rsquo;t want to give anyone any hope and gently
extricated myself into the elevator.</p>

<p>Ken joined me as the doors closed.  On our way down, I was like, &ldquo;man,
those girls are hard for me to leave!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>(*) The most attractive was the one with a retainer wire accenting her
lovely smile.</p>
