      <description>10:32 Thursday 14 December 2017 JST &amp;lsquo;far as I can tell, I have not yet documented how I back up Marble Track 3 data.
boto-rsync --endpoint objects-us-west-1.dream.io . s3://mt3/mt3  But to be clear, I have not confirmed the restore functionality!
I guess it would be
boto-rsync --endpoint objects-us-west-1.dream.io s3://mt3/mt3 .  but are there keys required? Let&amp;rsquo;s just check.
cd ~ mkdir mt3restore cd mt3restore boto-rsync --endpoint objects-us-west-1.dream.io s3://mt3/mt3 .</description>

      <description>13:53 Friday 04 August 2017 JST I tried getting Cyberduck to talk to Amazon S3, but could not do it as easily as I was able to get it to talk to Dream Objects S3.
Last time I used duplicity, I included GPG in the mix, so the files are encrypted. I apparently did not put the key in a safe place so they are effectively bricked.
This time, no GPG, and I have set the files to be public (but I do not know where / how people can access them).</description>

 Finder Anki Firefox Chrome Emacs Sublimetext 2 Skype XCode Netbeans Eclipse Gitx Unity iTerm Mail Preferences Minecraft Virtualbox Dogecoin-Qt Gimp iBooks HipChat MCEdit Avira Thunderbird iExplorer Audacity  items above featuring strikethroughs are those which I essentially never use.</description>
