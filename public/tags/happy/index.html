<p>Honored to be invited to the event! Admired that Rin has connected
lots of people who could easily become friends.</p>

<p>Upon arrival, Rin cried as Hiro predicted. Everyone had a great
time. I friended Chris just because he commented on the FB group.</p>

<p>Talked to him about PB 49 and 52, assuring him I could talk about it
all night (even though 13 years at wow)</p>

<p>Heard about Chris moving from China at age 10 to live in Cincinnati.</p>

<p>Last hug to Diana for now as she&rsquo;s about to head back to her country.
Got two cards from Sophia to hopefully introduce housing for her
company to find homestay families for youth.</p>

<p>Handed out my MKP Japan card like candy even though we are in a
digital world. Two women were like &ldquo;what about womankind project?&rdquo; so
I referred them to womanwithin.org.</p>

<p>Today after being out late last night at Lin&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s place, I was
happy that today is a holiday.  I slept a good bit of the day.</p>

<p>Super nice: I was able to figure out how to create a function to
simplify the creation of web pages for Marble Track 3
Parts](<a href="https://www.marbletrack3.com/parts/">https://www.marbletrack3.com/parts/</a>).  Now I just type <code>C-c p</code>
in Emacs, then enter the title, tags, and shortcode to produce a file
for a new Part in the Marble Track 3 website.</p>

<p>Today, with said shortcode, I started the page for
<a href="/p/mcbts">Medium Catcher Below Triple Splitter</a>.</p>

<p>Really glad to hear LouStar has new tracks out!</p>

<p>Not sure if this link will work, but I bought &ldquo;Favourite&rdquo; and &ldquo;Not
Gonna Lie&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not gonna lie, but &ldquo;Favourite&rdquo; is my favorite of the two.</p>

<h2 id="05-54-sunday-05-february-2017-jst">05:54 Sunday 05 February 2017 JST</h2>

<p>I woke up early today; I asked
<a href="https://wiki.robnugen.com/wiki/Items:Noisy">Noisy</a> to wake me up at
5:25 so I could &ldquo;get some work done&rdquo; before heading to see Mikarin&rsquo;s
piano recital.  I&rsquo;m bummed I&rsquo;ll miss SOGO (again (last week was due to
choosing to prepare for Head Heart and Soul presentation (and the week
before was cancelled by the organizers))), BUT as I sat down to &ldquo;do
work&rdquo; I felt cold, tired, and was like, boom</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have an idea!&rdquo; and I went outside and ran.  Well, jogged.  Up the
hill (as far as the second street light, after which I walked), up the
next little hill, down the stairrrrrrs, and then jogged back up the
hill and the next hill and then was going to head home, but fuckit not
tired yet so down the staiiirrrrrrrs again then jogged up the hill and
back past the pokestop to our house.</p>

<p>I think I will do this regularly.  I&rsquo;ll skip it on the days that Noisy
is set at that time so I can go to work, but do it on other days.  And
then maybe go to bed; who knows, but I&rsquo;m going to start waking up
early again.</p>
