Honored to be invited to the event! Admired that Rin has connected lots of people who could easily become friends.
Upon arrival, Rin cried as Hiro predicted. Everyone had a great time. I friended Chris just because he commented on the FB group.
Talked to him about PB 49 and 52, assuring him I could talk about it all night (even though 13 years at wow)</description>

      <description>20:28 Thursday 20 December 2018 JST Super nice: I was able to figure out how to create a function to simplify the creation of web pages for Marble Track 3 Parts](https://www.marbletrack3.com/parts/). Now I just type C-c p in Emacs, then enter the title, tags, and shortcode to produce a file for a new Part in the Marble Track 3 website.
Today, with said shortcode, I started the page for Medium Catcher Below Triple Splitter.</description>

Not sure if this link will work, but I bought &amp;ldquo;Favourite&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Not Gonna Lie&amp;rdquo;
Not gonna lie, but &amp;ldquo;Favourite&amp;rdquo; is my favorite of the two.

      <description>05:54 Sunday 05 February 2017 JST I woke up early today; I asked Noisy to wake me up at 5:25 so I could &amp;ldquo;get some work done&amp;rdquo; before heading to see Mikarin&amp;rsquo;s piano recital.
