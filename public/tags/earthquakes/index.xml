      <description>21:31 Saturday 30 May 2015 JST Not that no one else has noticed, but we&amp;rsquo;ve had a few big earthquakes in Japan recently, most recently at 8:34pm. It felt like a 3 or 4 in The Pink Cow, but it was a 5 out in the water. Fortunately, it had a depth of hundreds of miles, so no tsunami.
