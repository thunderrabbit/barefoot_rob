Such a nice lesson tonight! This was my first time to meet these students; they are three lovely women, two of whom are retired, one of whom does not have a computer nor TV! Wow!
We laughed a lot and they asked lots of questions and tried lots of speaking; I need to learn from them!
Also great: there are plenty of seats on the train on the way back.</description>
