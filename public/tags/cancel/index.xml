      <description>20:56 Sunday 04 March 2018 JST Went to SOGO for workout with about 50 people in attendance. Great weather and great workout. I met Shell, Koji, Tyler, and others, but cannot remember now.
Went to lunch with Lisa at Laska and chatted with her a bit, and got to see a video of the type of dancing she is doing.
Went down to Tsujido for karaoke after recording video at karaoke with Kai, Mitsue, and Soness as the stars.</description>

Last night JB school called me, &amp;ldquo;hey can you teach tonight??&amp;rdquo; and I go &amp;ldquo;sure!&amp;rdquo; even though it was raining.
Got dressed, including a tie, rain pants, rain jacket, and even my waterproof hiking boots. Took Lin&amp;rsquo;s bicycle because its seat is waterproof.
Smart me: I had my phone earphones in my ears (that&amp;rsquo;s right, future-people, we haven&amp;rsquo;t had them permanently attached yet!</description>

      <description>Letter to Sterling McCall
23 June 1998
Today on the way to the dentist, I hit something in the road and thought nothing of it. Soon, however, I noticed my steering seemed really far out of alignment. I was talking to Manda on my carphone at the time. &#34;Hang on one second; this is bad enough that I&#39;m going to pull over and look.&#34; I pulled over. I looked. The right front tire was entirely flat.</description>
