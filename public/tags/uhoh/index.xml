      <description>09:44 Tuesday 22 November 2016 JST We had a small earthquake at 6am. According to JMA quake website it was near Fukushima. My students this morning said there was a tsunami 1 meter tall.
Trains around Tokyo were snarled for a bit, but I arrived on time because I usually pad my commute for such problems.
This morning&amp;rsquo;s lesson was in Akabanebashi, a lesson I usually teach on Mondays. Now I&amp;rsquo;m in Akihabara eating breakfast across Beck&amp;rsquo;s Coffee Shop, and AKB48 Cafe and Shop, one of which is not yet open for the day.</description>
