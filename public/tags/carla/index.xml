In a camp area, getting to hang out with Carla after talking to some guys while up on stage prepping for an event, I told her how much I admired her ability to be genki with people and how I want to enjoying hanging out with peeps as much as she does. Something like how I need to just not worry about what other people think and just do whatever I want to do.</description>

Good-oh-my-gosh-it&amp;rsquo;s-cold-here-evening from Canada:
So the twins have safely arrived in Toronto!!!! We had quite a flight to say the least!! Maria managed to get her visa for Canada exactly 6 hours prior to take-off. Check-in became a complete debacle when the ground staff told us that two of our boxes were .5 kilograms over and would need to be repacked. Luckily the pilots for our flight were checking in at the counter beside us&amp;hellip;and offered to carry onto the plane&amp;hellip;the seven packages of Pokari Sweat powder and the one book that was causing the extra weight.</description>
