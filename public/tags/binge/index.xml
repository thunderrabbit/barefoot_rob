      <description>02:29 Saturday 13 January 2018 JST Heh. Well, it was pretty great. Dirk Gently&amp;rsquo;s Holistic Detective Agency was good enough that I just watched the last four (4) episodes in a row. At 40+ minutes each that&amp;rsquo;s 160+ minutes or about oh my god I have to go to bed.

Now it is apparently canceled, but I hope not. https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/dirk-gently-2-1202644035/</description>
