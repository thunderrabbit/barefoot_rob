      <description>21:31 Sunday 16 June 2019 JST Tonight in Azabu Juban I attended Tokyo Tribe&amp;rsquo;s workshop number 8, a look back at the first half of 2019, and a look forward at the second half.
Here is what I wrote as testimonial:
I learned I did a great deal in 2019 already and got good insights on what types of behaviors support my continued growth. Therefore, I can focus on the helpful behaviors and achieve even more in the second half of 2019.</description>

      <description>21:15 Sunday 09 June 2019 JST Six people in the visionboard workshop tonight. Great teaching points for me because Rin said the day before that I was the only one who expressed interest in attending. The next day three more chose to come, so it was Hiro, Rin, me, then three others, who were perfectly balanced for each other and us. Similar backstories, blessings for me to learn, etc.</description>
