<p>Had lessons with Sarus Mama and Papa today in Shibuya.  We set up
Skype on Sarumama&rsquo;s machine so she and I can skype next week.  Then
lesson with both of them again in two weeks.</p>

<p>Had a good lesson with 3 students this morning; they are working on
their presentations, and progressing quite nicely!  Right now we are
just memorizing, but in the future I will show them how to speak &lsquo;off
the cuff&rsquo; about any topic.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s lesson with GG was Part II of hard drive disassembly.  We
opened the outer case in Part I, and have now opened the hard drive
itself.  &ldquo;The platters are like mirrors!&rdquo;  and the warranty is
officially void.</p>

<p>Mutsumi told me she&rsquo;d like to be pera pera in English by 2020 for the
Olympics in Tokyo.  I told her it&rsquo;s quite a good goal and I&rsquo;ll support
her in doing it!  The first (four) steps are to practice practice
practice practice.</p>

<p>I told her I&rsquo;m taking 3 Japanese lessons per week because I really
wanna improve my Japanese (until I change my mind again　かな。。) but
for now, fuckit, three lessons a week.  I know I could go even harder
core than that, but this is prolly good enough for me for now.</p>

<p>Anyway, the lesson was good; we looked at her homework because she&rsquo;s
still kinda shy to speak..  Maybe I can look up some good exercises /
suggestions to encourage speaking even so.</p>

<p>At SS lesson, we described a picture, and practiced asking questions
based on the descriptions.  We then played a game where teams created
questions for a new picture and then took turns asking as the other
team answered (without looking at the picture).</p>

<p>That took most of the time.  Focus was on correctly using is/are
appropriately, and use of the phrase &ldquo;at least&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the remaining ten minutes, we went through &ldquo;Grade 3 Sentence
Completion 1&rdquo; worksheet from this page
<a href="https://www.englishforeveryone.org/Topics/Sentence-Completion.htm">https://www.englishforeveryone.org/Topics/Sentence-Completion.htm</a></p>

<p>Today at 9:30, I&rsquo;m substitute teaching <del>6</del> <ins>9</ins>
students who are apparently up-n-coming stars or at least wannabe
stars.  There&rsquo;s a non zero chance I might teach them again; we shall
see!</p>

<p>I just need to stay awake until then!  (I&rsquo;m in a nearby convenience store.)</p>

<hr />

<p>The class was fun!  Their band is
<a href="https://silent-siren.com/en/">Silent Siren</a>; we did an
adjective-opposites game and then practiced English phrases they can
use on stage.</p>

<p>Afterward, I received two chocolate valentines, including a homemade
cookie!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m enjoying my recent lessons a lot more by being more focused on
having the students speak instead of correcting their errors.  I pick
out a few points perhaps, but basically allow them to chatter away as
long as I can essentially understand what they mean.</p>

<p>Today with GG, I did the same exercise as I did down in Fukuura: gave
instructions for drawing some lines, circles and dots.. The
instructions aren&rsquo;t perfect in that they won&rsquo;t result in identical
drawings in all correct interpretations, but they give some nice
listening practice as well as a chance to use &ldquo;horizontal&rdquo; and
&ldquo;vertical&rdquo; in a somewhat tangible way,.. and they allow me to string
together some prepositional phrases which may take some practice to
understand!</p>

<p>Specifically,</p>

<pre><code>... in the center of the right side
</code></pre>

<p>which M thought she might interpret in a couple of different ways.</p>

<p>On our way back, we talked about Lin and my trip to the US.  M asked
if I had finished packing.  I invited her to ask me if I had <em>started</em>
packing!</p>

<p>She asked how long the flight would last: &ldquo;negative 5 hours&rdquo; and we
talked about jet lag a bit, which led me to talk about consciousness
training at <a href="https://www.monroeinstitute.org">The Monroe Institute</a>,
which led to discussion of life between lives and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN16ubqbJUA">finding our purpose in life</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, good day!</p>

<p>Extracted from emails to Mayumi:</p>

<pre><code>Thank you for sending the lesson notes!  I'm glad you like yesterday's
lesson style.  I hope to give all of you more speaking time!  If you
think of any activities which might be fun, feel free to let me know.
:-)

I will be thinking of ways to make the lessons more interesting.
one idea I have is to break up in pairs..  I think we should mix
up the pairs each time so we have different partners each time.
</code></pre>

<p>Mayumi noticed the lesson yesterday was slightly different than ones I
taught last year.  I made fewer corrections and encouraged more
practice speaking.  Only trick is that the students are at different
levels, so I need to take that into consideration.</p>

<p>Extracted from emails to Mayumi:</p>

<pre><code>At this point, I've only solved one puzzle.  I tried briefly to solve
one of the others, but was unable to do so after a few minutes.

But, more importantly, yes you guys certainly made great progress on
the one I finished for you!  It's a variant of one of my grandad's old
puzzles.  In a way, it's mathematically a variant of the round black
puzzle I showed you (with pegs that move in and out).


Regarding the puzzle, actually that one is the most difficult!  I was
able to solve the long chain puzzle in about 3 minutes, and I solved
the butterfly-looking puzzle in about 6 minutes.  The last one I still
haven't fully solved!  (I'm trying to get the puzzle back to its
starting position, but can only get about 1/8th of the way there.
(1/8 is my estimate, but if I understand the puzzle correctly, I'm
certainly not more than 1/4 of the way there, and I could be as far as
1/16th!  I believe you guys had it between 3/4ths to 7/8ths solved!)

<p>The puzzles were apparently from a 100 yen shop.  They&rsquo;re still neat
and different than puzzles I&rsquo;ve seen before.</p>

<p>The easiest one is similar to a linked horseshoes puzzle.</p>

<p>The second easiest features some rings wrapped / trappe on a curvy wire frame.</p>

<p>I still haven&rsquo;t solved the last one.  I&rsquo;m 99% sure it requires recursion.</p>
