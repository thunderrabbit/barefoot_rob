<p>Lesson at Zavas featured a high level discussion of two different
peering arrangements (p2p vs centralized) and the concept of
protocols.  I was planning to talk about Bitcoin, but the word &ldquo;peer&rdquo;
in the whitepaper started the discussion we ended up having.</p>

<p>I had a distinct sense of inadequacy when describing layers of
protocols that make up the internet, but that may be because when I
hear the phrase &ldquo;the internet&rdquo; in my mind, my mind replies with &ldquo;the
internet is made of cats, the internet is made of cats, cats! cats!
cats!&rdquo; before I can think of anything else.</p>

<p>Even so, I explained how centralized sites are targets for attack and
how they are &ldquo;free&rdquo; because they can sell our data.  I listed
bittorrent, tor, mumble, pgp, gpg as peer to peer protocols.  I guess
SMTP is one as well.  Not sure about Mumble, actually.</p>

<p>Met Kai today at 1pm to edit her presentation which she translated
from Japanese.  It was pretty decent actually, with just a few wonky
sentence structures and some punctuation typos.  It was so easy that
it did not take the 2 hours we had allocated, but boom done in an hour
sitting at (&ldquo;Fresh like a box of _______ ______&ldquo;) down near Azalea.</p>

<p>So tired, can barely stay awake enough to make sure I don&rsquo;t zonk out
and miss the lesson which starts 1t 5:30pm.  I actually considered
getting a massage for an hour because then I could sleep and they
would wake me up after the hour, but that would cost more cash than I
have on me.</p>

<p>Met new students for a first lesson in Nihonbashi.  Five beginner
students who all seem pretty genki. Some are more beginner than
others.</p>

<p>JB was there to do the introduction and everything went smoothly.  See
you guys again next week!  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear that!&rdquo;</p>

plan, but it resulted in silence during the latter half.  Hmmm.</p>

<p>I have Japanese lessons until 11:30pm tonight, and then have to leave
the house at 6:30am tomorrow.</p>

<p>Tonight will be my first lesson with 文子先生, though I&rsquo;m not sure if
that&rsquo;s the correct kanji for her name.</p>

<h2 id="20-27-monday-19-december-2016-jst">20:27 Monday 19 December 2016 JST</h2>

<h2 id="23-33-tuesday-20-december-2016-jst">23:33 Tuesday 20 December 2016 JST</h2>

<p>Fantastic lesson with 史子先生.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what the core difference is, but I somehow learned more
than in my other lessons.</p>

<p>At first she suggested Genki I, and then was like no wait Genki II,
when I tore through a lot of Genki I.</p>

<p>My homework is to write sentences for my arch nemesis: くれる</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m in Akihabara for my Thursday evening lesson, but some people are
still in a meeting in the room where the lesson is usually held.  One
of the other students is here, so I imagine we will get to kick them
out soon.</p>

<p>Because of my sweet drink, she asked if I like sweets / sweet drinks.</p>

<p>I started to explain the difference between the sweet adjective and
sweets as nouns.  She asked if it was the same as &ldquo;suite room.&rdquo;  Nope;
suite is a noun.</p>

<p>Great lesson this morning.  M and N each gave presentations on the
voting age in Japan.  We cleaned up the presentations and they got
progressively more coherent, though still not perfect.  This is the
second week for us on the topic, so next week will be a new topic:
compulsory vacation days in Japan.</p>

what I call the Zavas building.</p>

<p>As predicted, our students are not yet here, but they still have 1
second by my.. nevermind, now they&rsquo;re late.</p>

<p>Lesson was good; we somehow got onto the subject of web security; I
encouraged them to use a password manager like

<p>I taught a lesson this morning for Matt in Marunochi.  Three students,
relatively high level.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s my report on the lesson:</p>

<pre>
Topics included introductions (given that it was our first lesson
together), differences in culture between the US and Japan, and (after
the women left at 8:55 for an accounting class,) finance.
