<p>Great lesson with GG in Akihabara!  They are so inquisitive, creative,
inspiring, understanding, and thankful!  And I&rsquo;m thankful for such a
fun time in lessons with them.</p>

<p>M asked how I met Lin so I got to tell them that story.</p>

<p>I just gotta be careful to let them speak as well!!</p>

<p>Finished my AM lesson with only M in attendance.  We talked about paid
vacation days.  The article mentioned France with people taking 93% of
their 37 available vacation days.  In Japan people took 50% of their
18 vacation days.</p>

<p>M took 5% of his vacation days, and seemed pretty O_o when hearing
about other cultures.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought vacation days were just for emergencies!&rdquo;</p>

<p>hmm..</p>

<p>Such a nice lesson tonight!  This was my first time to meet these
students; they are three lovely women, two of whom are retired, one of
whom does not have a computer nor TV!  Wow!</p>

<p>We laughed a lot and they asked lots of questions and tried lots of
speaking; I need to learn from them!</p>

<p>Also great: there are plenty of seats on the train on the way back.</p>

<p>I was a minute late to A and C&rsquo;s lesson, but they were 5 and 20 minutes
late, respectively.  whew!</p>

<p>We hadn&rsquo;t seen C in three weeks so I asked A to ask some questions
about C&rsquo;s latest adventures. I took notes on two separate sheets of
paper on which I made corrections and then had them do the same
conversation again, but using the new phrases.  I hope it was helpful!</p>

<p>At the end, each student got their own page with corrections.</p>

<p>Fun lesson with Yoshi today, and then went to dinner with Yoshi and
Mutsumi. Yummy and great plus we got free drinks because I found a
fish scale in the liver pâté.</p>

<p>Yay! for the first time I got to have a bit of a tour in
<a href="https://toshiba-mirai-kagakukan.jp/en/">Toshiba Science Museum</a> on
Christmas day.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s actually quite interesting; they&rsquo;ve got a couple of presentations
every half hour, at least one of which involves materials cooled with
liquid nitrogen for super conductive levitation around a small
circular track.</p>

<p>I hope I can get them to put Francois on the hovering block some time!</p>

<p>Tonight was my second night to teach at Kawasaki Daishi.  It&rsquo;s great;
the lessons are casual and it&rsquo;s only a 12 minute TJ Bike ride from our
house.  We practiced using &ldquo;I would like&rdquo; for ordering at restaurants
and reserving airline tickets.</p>

for us.  We had a good laugh when we realized the guy started his

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t really a &ldquo;bitcoin lesson&rdquo;, but when my one (1) student
showed up fifteen (15) minutes late, I had been reading posts in
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bitTippers">/r/bitTippers</a> (and for the first
time published a link to my subreddit
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/consecutiveNaturals">/r/consecutiveNaturals</a>)
and Bitcoin was on my brain so I asked if she had heard of it. She
had, but didn&rsquo;t have access to any, so I suggested
<a href="https://www.changetip.com/">change tip</a> to help her get started.</p>

<p>We talked about the shifting landscape of economics; her company&rsquo;s
biggest clients used to be banks, but they&rsquo;re all merging and going
bankrupt so those are no longer the gravy train they once were.</p>
