<p>Good last lesson of the year with GG, featuring only M and Te because
Y had to leave for a 忘年会 (end of year party).</p>

<p>Actually M was quite late, but she brought back the Digits in a Box
puzzle, which I think I&rsquo;ve written about before.  She wasn&rsquo;t able to
solve it without looking it up online.  I plan to give it to Fred not
just unsolved, but without the containing box, so he won&rsquo;t immediately
know how small it can be made.</p>

<p>Met a new student who would like to practice presentations for his new
business.  When I heard that, I remembered all the times I&rsquo;ve heard
that before, and all the times the students have quickly given
up. (80% ?)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to think it&rsquo;s not completely my fault, but in any case, I
have a good feeling about this particular person, except that he seems
to have a pretty busy schedule, and would like to have lessons on an
ad hoc basis, which I can imagine may become less and less frequent.</p>

<p>But anyway, his project sounds really neat!  He&rsquo;s not presenting a
bunch of boring numbers, but a bunch of exciting ideas, and I look
forward to helping him succeed in this new business endeavor.</p>

<p>We might even go on road trips to see the site.</p>

<p>Lesson tonight featured four students, including Bob, Michael, George,
and Edgar, the English names of Yuta, Hirofumi, Ryo, and Masao.  We
reviewed &ldquo;pumped&rdquo; and Bob practiced answering &ldquo;it was fine&rdquo; for some
questions of the form &ldquo;how was (it)?&rdquo; because when I asked &ldquo;How was
the party?&rdquo; he originally answered, &ldquo;I was fun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Homework will be for each of them to create something and bring it (or
a picture) to show and talk about it.</p>

<p>Headed to lesson, bitching to Fred about Apple.  He has lost a hard
drive due to the same problem, but was able to recover it by sending
to his local admins at UT.</p>

<p>It was a trial lesson, and before the lesson started, I was pretty
well set on not accepting it: I have to wear a suit; it&rsquo;s on Friday
night; etc.</p>

<p>But, it was fine; the students seem earnest, eager, etc.. plus it&rsquo;s
only a 3 month contract, so I can survive that long, じゃない？</p>

<p>Today C indicated she would probably not join the lesson next time
because she&rsquo;s tired.  I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that; I imagine I could have
done something different so that she would have enjoyed the lessons
more, but maybe not.</p>

<p>Talking about puzzles near the end of our lesson, I remembered the
word puzzles with five houses, five owners, five colors, five pets,
and five jobs.</p>

<p>Several clues are given and then the question: &ldquo;Who likes fishing?&rdquo;
can be solved with a little logic.</p>

<p>SO, I attempted to create such a puzzle for GG, but with only 3 houses
because I only had 5 minutes to do it:</p>

<ul>
<li>There are three houses, three nationalities, and three pets.</li>
<li>The Canadian lives next to the dog owner.</li>
<li>The American lives in the green house.</li>
<li>The owner of the blue house has a fish.</li>
<li>The fish is not next to the Frenchman&rsquo;s house.</li>
<li>The owner of the red house is French.</li>
<li>The dog lives in the middle house.</li>
<li>Who owns the cat?</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, the huge caveat: I don&rsquo;t know if this can be solved.  I have a
feeling the details of the neighborhood cannot be completely solved
because there&rsquo;s no indication of left vs right.</p>

<p>How does one prove if this kind of question has the correct number of
clues?</p>

<p>In other news, I showed them Pop Pop Chaos after the lesson.  M was
interested but T was not, and A was like, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a computer or
a smartphone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I love A. Today she told me she doesn&rsquo;t have AC.  Awesome!</p>

all shocked to know three towers had fallen that day.  I&rsquo;m curious if
they&rsquo;ll do some research on their own. T told me after class she
couldn&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
