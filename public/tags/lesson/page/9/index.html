go over the material exactly at his preferred rate.</p>

<p>I enjoy lessons with M and M because they both do lots of homework so
we can focus on exactly what they want to do, and between lessons I
can focus on exactly what I want to do.</p>

<p>Before the lesson, we agreed on the schedule for February, when I&rsquo;m
planning to go to Kagoshima for 2 weeks.</p>

<p>After the lesson, M asked me when she&rsquo;ll become fluent&hellip; and I told
her that she will need to practice speaking if she wants to speak
English more fluently.</p>

<p>M did good homework.</p>

<p>M was pretty chill; she wasn&rsquo;t feeling 100% so we didn&rsquo;t do a ton, but
had fun.  I&rsquo;m so lucky.  :-)</p>

<p>(written 10:54 Friday 21 November 2014 JST)</p>

<p>Last night JB school called me, &ldquo;hey can you teach tonight??&rdquo; and I go
&ldquo;sure!&rdquo; even though it was raining.</p>

<p>Got dressed, including a tie, rain pants, rain jacket, and even my waterproof
hiking boots.  Took Lin&rsquo;s bicycle because its seat is waterproof.</p>

<p>Smart me: I had my phone earphones in my ears (that&rsquo;s right,
future-people, we haven&rsquo;t had them permanently attached yet! (and we
certainly haven&rsquo;t re-achieved natural telepathy!)) because JB School
called me when I was halfway there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nevermind!  sorry!  But we&rsquo;ll pay you half the lesson fee for your effort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fair enough.</p>

<p>Thanks to Soness helping me prepare, I was well enough prepared for
the kids lesson even though I felt crazy afraid before the lesson. I
believed I wasn&rsquo;t prepared; I had forgotten to bring Johnny (the
stuffed bear) who I planned to use as a teaching assistant; I didn&rsquo;t
have a way to play music in the class, and I was just a frazzled nut
before the lesson.</p>

<p>I texted Soness, and she called me back immediately for support. She
got me sorted: &ldquo;well, does the school have any stuffed animals you can
use?&rdquo; (they did) &ldquo;do they have any flashcards?&rdquo; (oh yeah I had
forgotten), and just general confidence that I&rsquo;d be fine.</p>

<hr />

<p>The lessons were a bit chaotic, but everyone survived (including me)
and only a few people cried (not including me).  The second class had
23 students, so we counted to 25 in the circle (includind me and their
full time teacher), and since they did so well, I had us count up
to 50.</p>

improved during the lesson and I think I helped in some way.</p>

<p>M has been studying hard; he prepared a presentation of his company&rsquo;s
products. Really neat to hear how gpleats are created!</p>

<p>M brought blueberry flavored chocolate balls! She explained how her
other teacher didn&rsquo;t check her homework, so I checked it for her.</p>
