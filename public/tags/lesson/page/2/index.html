<p>Today was the last lesson for Ushigoro.  We had finished up everything
last week, having done their exams, so today we just did lots of Q and
A sessions, first with the class split into two groups, and then with
all students asking questions of one student.</p>

<p>I offered my LINE QR code in case they want to ask questions or
continue practicing their English.  I hope this helps them stay
engaged until the next session starts.</p>

<p>Went to SOGO for workout with about 50 people in attendance.  Great
weather and great workout.  I met Shell, Koji, Tyler, and others, but
cannot remember now.</p>

<p>Went to lunch with Lisa at Laska and chatted with her a bit, and got
to see a video of the type of dancing she is doing.</p>

<p>Went down to Tsujido for karaoke after recording video at karaoke with
Kai, Mitsue, and Soness as the stars.  Got to see long-time-no-see
Yuji, and longer-time-no-see Jesse.  Plus got to meet all-time-no-see
Vesna.  Thanks to Soness for organizing and inviting, and giving me
some crazy sock-shoes!</p>

<p>Came back for lesson with Sarumama but got her cancellation request on
my way home.  She said she will pay for the lesson.</p>

<p>Walking toward home, I saw the guy next to the telescope stand I
sometimes see with or without a telescope.  This time he had his
telescope connected to a laptop which could see the image.  Much
easier to use than back in the day when we had to squat down and
squint up into the eyepiece.  He showed me a picture he had taken of a
nebula, which was apparently 120 snapshots overlaid on each other to
get sufficient brightness.  It looked quite good for such a small
telescope!  (3 inches or so)</p>

<p>Now I am in Akihabara, across the street from GG lesson which starts
at 18:30.</p>

<p>I bought a trackball mouse to replace the one I had before which seems
to just mysteriously and annoyingly not work anymore.  This time I
will keep the receipt because I think the old one konked out before
its warranty was up.</p>

<p>Today was the first of five 2-hour lessons this month at SCC.  Today I
helped Tomoko by making corrections to her written English.  She plans
to present the features of some of her company&rsquo;s products.  Pretty
cool stuff like elevators and batteries, and elevators that run on
batteries.  We studied up in their cafeteria on the 4th floor, and
then I went down the escalator to the third floor and went out the
exit I had never gone out before (but had seen many times).  Neat!</p>

<p>I discovered their wide screen TV wall is run via HDMI.</p>

<p>Mutsumi introduced a new style lesson format where the guides sit down
together with me instead of just having individual lessons.  Hopefully
this will help them improve listening skills by listening to other
people have conversations in English.</p>

<p>I showed mt3s.robnugen.com to Miyako and Ayaka.  Miyako showed me pics
from her trip to the US with Haruka.</p>

<p>Good lesson today at TB; they had just redone the place so I got a
grand tour of the show room.  Midori talked to some clients while
Tomoko gave me the tour.  They didn&rsquo;t have anything to check yet, but
I saw lots of word-for-word translations which we will have to clean
up later.</p>

<p>They actually had to leave 10 minutes earlier than normal, so I headed
out at 1:50pm.</p>

<p>On Monday I got my bag back from ML, where I had left it the previous
week while substituting on the 7th floor.  I found out then that they
have a show room and after I got my bag, I went to it.  They have a
lock which can be reset with one key and relocked with any 1 of
another set of keys, which then becomes the only key which can unlock
it (except the reset key, of course).  The keys had grooves running
along the face, instead of just dimples.</p>

<p>The reset key&rsquo;s grooves looked a bit random, so I guess it is keyed to
that specific lock and not a super great grand master key that resets
any of those kind of locks (of course).</p>

<p>NA is the two letter designation for a new lesson I will be teaching
on Mondays.  It is within walking distance of the Monday morning
lesson, but there is a bit of a gap in between so I am chilling at a
restaurant in Tokyo Tower.</p>

<p>Lesson was tough at first when I tried terribly to explain my
intention to the group of quietly patient students.  Man oh man they
had a bilingual woman last time; how I wished she had been in
attendance!</p>

<p>Got it sorted out after I started doing role plays, in which,
fortunately, I was able to incorporate some of the words we had gone
over before.  Yay for winging it!</p>

<p>In other news; it looks like a boat race place is being built in
Roppongi!  Ain&rsquo;t water for miles around but the signs at a
construction site were all about boat racing.</p>

<p>Hopefully I have learned all the lessons I need to learn from this
situation.  I considered documenting everything in my journal, or a
gist,.. but a bunch of deleted lines in git will have to do.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s just say &ldquo;Buffer 03s-effect.md has shrunk a lot; auto save disabled in that buffer until next real save&rdquo;</p>

<p>I am going to go meditate now to regain some sanity and hopefully
shine some good light on all this.</p>
