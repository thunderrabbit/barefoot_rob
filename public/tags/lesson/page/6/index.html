<p>I had the smart idea of making teams to create and ask questions
instead of just boring-lecturing today&rsquo;s topic.  Two team captains
self-selected and then chose the first 2 peeps on their team, and then
I arbitrarily divided the rest so there would be no last person
selected.</p>

<h2 id="11-50am">11:50am</h2>

<p>During the third hour, in which we were asked to talk about the new
WTC complex, I spoke about the events on the day.  What happened?
Plane hit building.  Right. Then what happened?  Plane hit other
building.  Right. Then what happened to the buildings?  Collapse.
Right.  So how many buildings collapsed?  Two. Okay, and you guys,
what do you think?  Two.</p>

<p>ブッブー  [buzzer onomatopoeia]  Three.</p>

<p>I was glad to see the surprise register on some of the students&rsquo;
faces.</p>

<p>I just touched on the easy points of the story: fire caused
symmetrical collapse; firefighters knew it would collapse before it
did.  BBC knew about the collapse before it did. Silverstein&rsquo;s big
insurance premium.  Planes have wings.  trillions announced lost the
day before, Enron SEC filings in third tower.</p>

<p>Anyway, I then went through the prescribed material about the new
complex: 4 WTC designed by some guy; 1 WTC is 541 meters tall;
reflecting pools are in footprints of towers; etc etc boring junk.</p>

<p>Class ended and I confirmed they remembered the search term WTC 7.</p>

<p>Just finished lunch with Kazu, Tony, Tomomi, Stuart, and Tyrell at a
pizza place apparently rated the 2nd best pizza in Tokyo.  I thought
it was as good as CPK, but not as good as Star Pizza (of course!?)  I
had a four cheese pizza to myself, while the others shared things with
spicey sauce, tomatos, meat, more meat, and some sea food.</p>

<p>Lesson featured 9 students (of ten on my roster), with little or no
class interaction.  Pretty difficult for me so I hope to remember not
to do lessons for junior high school students without a bit of
training first!</p>

<p>One student put his head down several times, though he was actually
one of the most capable in the class, so I guess he was bored.</p>

<p>Lesson was good; same company, but new class with seven students, who
were willing to use the idea I got from my Spanish teacher back in the
day: use a new target-language name&hellip; basically take a new name, move
to a new city, get a new job.  So I&rsquo;m Rob from Sydney, and, to honor
my Spanish teacher having been a payaso, am a clown.</p>

<p>Though the weekly lessons are only scheduled for a month, but I&rsquo;m
optimistic that the students (FS) had enough fun tonight and will
continue enjoying their fun learning adventure enough to continue
after the initial period.</p>

<p>But my right elbow hurts now from typing up on the table; I should
have used my keyboard.  Dang.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m about an hour early; I&rsquo;m going to look at laptops to see what I
can see.  I should prolly also jump on TLUG list or go to a meeting
before buying anything&hellip;</p>

<h2 id="18-15">18:15</h2>

<p>I wandered around a bit and couldn&rsquo;t find anything good in any of the
smaller shops.  Even when I found things that seemed basically good,
they had Japanese keyboards, which aren&rsquo;t good for me.</p>

<p>Went to a couple big box stores.  One said they don&rsquo;t sell machines
without an OS installed.  The other one said come back later (I
think), and I might.  But not tonight.</p>

<h2 id="20-00">20:00</h2>

<p>The lesson was great, as usual.  GG are just so positive, inquisitive,
thoughtful, and lovely!</p>

<p>They had a meeting afterward, so we didn&rsquo;t walk to the station
together.  That worked out well; I had planned to tell them I was
going to go to 80s Cafe.</p>

<p>I went to 80s Cafe for the English lesson there.  It was a much
smaller group than the Japanese lessons, but still the same kinda
format: one instructor and students.  I seemed to be the only native
English speaker on the student side of things.</p>

<p>After the lesson ended at 9, everyone promptly left, and Wada-san and
I chatted about junk, arriving at cheesemaking as my next plan.</p>

<p>Today before GG lesson, T asked A (in English) if she had read M&rsquo;s email.  A said
she had not.</p>

<p>I used this simple exchange as the basis for fully 45 minutes of
lesson:</p>

<pre><code>T: &quot;Did you read M's email?&quot;
A: &quot;No I didn't.&quot;

R: &quot;What did you ask her?&quot;
T: &quot;I asked her if she had read M's email.&quot;
R: &quot;and what did she say?&quot;
T: &quot;She said she hadn't.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>(^_^)V</p>

<pre><code>R: &quot;What did she ask you?&quot;
A: &quot;She asked me if I had read M's email.&quot;
R: &quot;and what did you tell her?&quot;
A: &quot;I told her I hadn't.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>(^_^)V</p>

<p>Then, when M arrived, I asked her to ask T what she had asked A.</p>

<pre><code>M: &quot;What did you ask A?&quot;
T: &quot;I asked her if she had read your email.&quot;
M: &quot;What did she say?&quot;
T: &quot;She said she hadn't.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>(^_^)V</p>

<p>And then I had M ask A what she had been asked.</p>

<pre><code>M: &quot;What did T ask you?&quot;
A: &quot;She asked me if I had read your email.&quot;
M: &quot;What did you tell her?&quot;
A: &quot;I told her I hadn't.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>(^_^)V</p>

<p>And then we went a step deeper.</p>

<pre><code>R: &quot;Sorry, M, what did you ask T?&quot;
M: &quot;I asked her what she had asked A.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>(^_^)V</p>

<pre><code>R: &quot;T, what did M ask you?&quot;
T: &quot;She asked me what I had asked A.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>(^_^)V</p>

<pre><code>R: &quot;A, what did M ask T?&quot;
A: &quot;She asked what T had asked me.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>(^_^)V</p>

<p>Then, while I was checking homework, M smartly asked T if she could
see her notebook (which I had just corrected).</p>

<pre><code>R: &quot;What did you ask her?&quot;
M: &quot;I asked her if she would show me her notebook.&quot;
M: &quot;I aksed her if I could see her notebook.&quot;
M: &quot;I asked for her notebook.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Lesson with C in Akabanebashi went well today.  She&rsquo;s got great
fluency but chaotic grammar, featuring lots of instances of &ldquo;is&rdquo; in
place of a variety of verbs in a variety of tenses.</p>

<p>For example, &ldquo;lesson with C is good today.  She is fluency and bad
grammar is lots of is to any verb any time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yesterday&rsquo;s lesson went well today.  Tariq gave me some suggestions
for how to adjust the student&rsquo;s transcript, and it all seemed to work
as he guessed.</p>
