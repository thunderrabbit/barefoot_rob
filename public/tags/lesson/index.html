                        <p>Hide and Akiko from 7pm class each needed to make up some lessons, so
stayed for the 8pm class featuring Misato and Tatsuya.</p>

<p>I think it worked pretty well; they had not met each other, and they
are all pretty much similar personalities so I figured they would get
along fine.</p>

<p>After self intros, most of the time they talked about Akiko&rsquo;s challenging business trip
to Hydrabad, India.  Most of the rest of the time we talked about Hide&rsquo;s work.</p>

                        <p>(written 09:26 Saturday 14 September 2019 JST)</p>

<p>Today I was five minutes late to (teach) my lesson with Yuna; I
excitedly told her about going to see
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/叶結
Kanauknot-2016891955206776/">叶結（Kanauknot)</a> today in 豊島園after having seen them in
ぐりんぱ.</p>

<p>I was so excited that I explained &ldquo;hh hh hh hh hh&rdquo;, from
<a href="https://thunderrabbit.com/castle/Dragon_run-way">The Castle of Dreams</a></p>

<p>I was so excited that for 30 minutes, this overshadowed my news about
having done my first stand up comedy last night after being invited by
Soness.</p>

<p>After talking about how Soness has been a great friend for years,
working as a performer (for English Carnival), speaker coach (for
various TED and TED-style events), and now beginning to explore stand
up comedy as a hobby, Yuna began to think about what it might be like
to have a hobby that could become a job.</p>

<p>I saw this in her expression and was like, &ldquo;I think you are thinking
about how you can make your hobby into a career&rdquo; and quickly rattled
off three ways I thought reading books could become a career.</p>

<ul>
<li>publisher</li>
<li>editor</li>
<li>audio book voice</li>
</ul>

<p>I was  surprised to hear Yuna  had heard that one  &ldquo;cannot enjoy their
job&rdquo;  or something.   I  thought  <em>Oh man  that  sounds like  terrible
advice!!!</em> and said &ldquo;well, I believe otherwise..&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the end, I used the question
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/niyaa.rn">Rin</a> gave me and invited Yuna to
think about what workshop she would <em>love</em> to present for people.  I
offered that it would likely fit well with Giselle&rsquo;s
<a href="https://www.meetup.com/English-coffee-more/">English&amp;Coffee + More!!</a>
meetup group.</p>

<p>Next lesson next week, much more space for Yuna to speak!</p>

<p>Akiko and I went to CoCo&rsquo;s for our language exchange today and she
helped me figure out how the EOS tea business works.</p>

<p>We each ordered drink bar for around 400 yen.  As thanks for her
business support today, I paid for hers.</p>

<p>Today I showed students in Akihabara the website and snippets for
<a href="https://www.marbletrack3.com/">Marble Track 3</a>.  They were like
&ldquo;waow&rdquo; etc.  I love the project and felt a bit guilty for taking up
a significant amount of class time with it.  We have had lessons for
years though, so I don&rsquo;t think they will mind.</p>

<p>Today was the last lesson with Sweets Attendants.  (Their office is
being shut down at the end of this month, but I am leaving next week
for three weeks overseas.)</p>

<p>I met Tomoko at CPK at 11am and helped her carry pizza to their office
where we had a party, including candy I bought from the conveni ond
3F.</p>

<p>The party was fun, but afterward I unfortunately let myself get
sidetracked into dealing with some work related Excel spreadsheet
crap, but got it sorted out by moving the spreadsheet into Google
Sheets, where I can use the <code>=FILTER()</code> function.  Why can&rsquo;t I use
such a function in LibreOffice?</p>

<p>That took an hour out of our 4 hours allotted, but then I got to chat
with Midori for a bit about her plans.  At the end of our time
together, I went to the front desk and received a small white wooden
box with four drawers that I plan to use for Marble Track 3 parts.
Tomoko had apparently brought it to the office and apparently does not
want it anymore.</p>

<p>We stood to say bye to a bunch of guys leaving the conference room
right around the time that I also had to go.  That had me trapped a
bit longer than I wanted, during which time I wanted to reiterate they
can ask me for references or whatever they need for job search.  After
the conference room cleared out, I headed out and Tokyo-waved while
walking out the two sets of glass doors.</p>

<p>Gosh I am going to miss the sweets party attendants!</p>

<p>Sweets Party Attendants had their second to last lesson with me
today.  The mood was both somber and joyful; it has been great working
with them over the years.</p>

<p>The lessons I teach on Wednesday morning used to be on Thursday
mornings.  They were one of the first lessons I taught for JB.  Pretty
convenient when Lin and I lived near Kawasaki station, but now it
takes over an hour to go each way for an hour lesson.</p>

<p>Once I win the lottery, this will be one of the first lessons I
release because I have to leave the house by 5:45 to get a seat on the
train on the way there (or leave by 6:15 and stand for 40 minutes
total on (two) trains).</p>

<p>Two years ago, Mayumi gave me
<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=hanayama+marble+images&amp;ia=images">Hanayama Marble</a>.
After playing with it for weeks, I nearly solved it, but in a fit of
frustration gave up and looked up the answer online.  Upon seeing the
solution, I thought &ldquo;ahhhh crap of course!!!&rdquo;  It is such an elegant
solution and I was nearly there.</p>

<p>Four weeks ago, in this class, we started playing a pattern matching
word game.  For fun, I started with the same word one of the students
had started with.</p>

<ul>
<li>Haneda Airport</li>
<li>LA International Airport</li>
<li>Mt Fuji</li>
<li>Kobe Airport</li>
</ul>

<p>I thought they would be able to solve it quickly, but this went on for
four weeks until I finally had to pull the plug because one of the
students expression was like <em>fuck this</em>.  I ended up giving them the
answer and the same student was like &ldquo;ahhhh crap of course!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So in honor of that, today I brought my Hanayama Marble puzzle and
left it with one of the students to play with.</p>

<p>Good lesson this morning with just two students.  We talked about
rental おっさん in Japan.  Interesting concept of renting old men
because they are older and presumably wiser.  They?  We?</p>

<p>Walked with Tariq from Akabanebashi to Shibashi while we talked about
future plans for our
<a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi">swipe game</a>. He found a
designer who can create excellent graphics.</p>

<p>Did not end up needing my computer, but I have my rolly bag so no
worries.</p>

<p>Rolled to Ginza Line and got back to my station for 411 yen, given
that I have a free pass from Shin Yurigaoka to Noborito.</p>

<p>Good lesson at IL this morning, though only two students attended.  I
praised the student who came 35 minutes late to thank her for
attending even though it was apparently a challenge to join.</p>

<p>Next week&rsquo;s lesson is canceled due to a week of holidays, so on May
7th, I will invite them to talk about their holidays in English.</p>

<p>New regular students in SS lesson this morning; Kaede stopped coming
relatively soon after joining last year, and Chika apparently took my
bitcoin advice (whereas I did not haha) so she moved overseas.
Satoshi has not come recently, and Sayuri said she was busy today,
plus said Ayano something something so could not come.  Nonoka and Ai
came today.  Ai helped Nonoka with some phrases and months of the
year.  We played a little month game asking the date of Christmas,
Halloween, Tanabata, White Day, etc.</p>

<p>Now I am in a cafe on ground floor of Muza watching pigeons and peeps
walk, fly, and or meander through the breezeway.</p>
