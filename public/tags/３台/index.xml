      <description>21:44 Tuesday 12 May 2015 JST Our office space is being reduced from 4 desks to 2, so three old computers were being tossed. I grabbed two of them (Dell Precision M4500, its power supply, bluetooth mouse, its power supply, and white plastic Macbook), so now have three laptops in my backpack. Supa heavy! I plan to put Ubuntu on one or both of them.
The Dell boots fine into Windows, so I downloaded latest Ubuntu and plan to toss it onto my usb keychain and wipe the disk then install Ubuntu and play with encrypted partitions and such.</description>
