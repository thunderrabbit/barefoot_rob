      <description>01:46 Tuesday 13 March 2018 JST 09:46 Monday 12 March 2018 Portland Recreational marijuana is legal in Oregon. I took advantage of this fact last night and had a really overall positive experience with several experiencial teachings I gained.
I am still a bit affected as I write this, sitting in the airport in Portland, waiting for my flight back to Narita.
The most interesting aspect about the experience itself was the time stretching.</description>
