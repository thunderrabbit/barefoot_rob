      <description>10:46 Friday 29 January 2016 CST Jason&amp;rsquo;s coming soon to pick us up!
14:59 Great time lunching and chatting with Jason while we ate and drove around looking for skates for me. I&amp;rsquo;m sorry I didn&amp;rsquo;t know skates are so 90&amp;rsquo;s and unavailable so we didn&amp;rsquo;t call to check before going to The DOMAIN on a proverbial wild goose chase and came back with exactly that. Goose egg.
We talked about Japan, Tokyo, his business, motorcycles, old days, skates, Francois&amp;hellip; Plus Jason bought us lunch at Magnolia Grill!</description>

      <description>(transcribed from my diary)
##17 April 1999
Jason called this morning. He was all, &amp;ldquo;Rob, wanna go to Australia with me for four months?&amp;rdquo;
whoah! said my brain. &amp;ldquo;Whoah. Four months?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Yeah. My mom said that I should travel before I try to do anything else so I told her &amp;lsquo;okay; me and Rob are going to Australia.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Wow. That would be totally great, and I can see the value in it.</description>
