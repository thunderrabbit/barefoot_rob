      <description>22:03 Wednesday 27 February 2019 JST Today was the 3-weeks-out meeting for we staff of the New Warrior Training Adventure (NWTA) in British Columbia, Canada. It was a good meeting; we each have a buddy and each man on the call checked in for his buddy, with the presumption that the buddies have been in touch with each other.
I was inspired after the call and reached out to my two teams via email.</description>

      <description>09:26 Friday 07 July 2017 JST I was invited to continue for another 6 weeks of online circle (not really a circle, but) facilitation practice starting 20 July. I feel fear about leading my own groups, but I will head that direction anyway.</description>
