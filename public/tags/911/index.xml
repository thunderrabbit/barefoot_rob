      <description>12:14 Saturday 18 July 2015 JST GG lesson that night featured a discussion of Airplane Day; they were all shocked to know three towers had fallen that day. I&amp;rsquo;m curious if they&amp;rsquo;ll do some research on their own. T told me after class she couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe it.</description>
