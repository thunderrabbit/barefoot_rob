      <description>17:58 Thursday 27 July 2017 JST While I was walking out of Ueno station, a tall man and I did the foreigner nod and then he said he had seen me on TV (for being barefoot). We shook hands and talked for a bit about the importance of doing one&amp;rsquo;s own thing.
He said, &amp;ldquo;I respect you,&amp;rdquo; and I should have said if he sees respectability in me, that means it&amp;rsquo;s in him, too.</description>
