      <description>20:00 Sunday 21 April 2019 JST Lin and I enjoyed a great productive day today, starting with a romp after calling my mom on voip.
Main things for me: work on AB, fix bicycles. Lin wanted to clean the house a bit so she did that while I worked on AB.
We walked our decrepit bicycles to a local shop. Mine had to get a new chain; Lin&amp;rsquo;s bicycle needed a new valve stem and new seat.</description>

      <description>05:20 Monday 20 August 2018 JST Lin and I walked together yesterday on a completely new route.
I chose not to go to SOGO after flipping a coin after Lin asked if I wanted to stay at home and install the vertical labyrinth game.</description>

      <description>22:20 Sunday 19 August 2018 JST A couple of years ago I received a vertical labyrinth game from the toy store I used to frequent in Harajuku on the way to my lesson with Sarumama.
In the past couple of days I decided to mount the game on our wall so we can actually play with it!
Here is the game resting on a shelf, where any decent sized earthquake could send it toppling to disaster.</description>

      <description>03:03 Sunday 09 July 2017 JST I set my alarm to wake up early this morning so I can get some work done while it&amp;rsquo;s not too hot in my room. When my computer gets hot, it gets slow. (Basically because it is old and the kernel task starts to go crazy and take all the CPU.)</description>
