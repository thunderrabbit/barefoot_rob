There was an interesting game at the toy store today: Chaos, a disc stacking game. Interesting are the rules; it&amp;rsquo;s super simple, but redistribution of tiles is forced at times during the game, making predictions pretty difficult. I wonder if it would translate well to an online game. The physical game uses a 3D play area so a 2D version would have to be tweaked a bit.</description>
