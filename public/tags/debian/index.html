<pre><code>I'm using my Debian box now, wirelessly (thanks to you), using a dual 
monitor setup (thanks to Debian maintainers), and have gotten several 
things working well, almost including the ability to make changes for 
work while my other machine is in the shop.  You suggested that I can 
reinstall Debian when I get my next PC, but is there some way to save 
time reinstalling all the junk on a new Debian install?  If not, then 
perhaps I can just update the kernel and keep this same hard drive in 
the new machine.  Speaking of which, I looked for Dell laptops in the 
Akihabara area, but didn't find anyone who can help me get an English 
keyboard and a blank hard drive.  I may come to the next TLUG meeting 
to see what's people suggest.  Or, might just just order straight off 
Dell's site. Okay, not sure how much longer I can keep up this margin 
alignment, so I'll find some way to end things so it lines up nicely.

<p>Crud.</p>

<p>I forgot to consider the chipset when getting my wifi USB thing.  I
can&rsquo;t figure out how to make Debian use it.</p>

<p>The Dell is essentially not useable for me as a work computer without
wifi unless I string a network cable from our living room to my desk,
which I don&rsquo;t think Lin would like because I can&rsquo;t do it in a way that
will allow the doors to close (without damaging the house).</p>

<p>Anyway, I tried to reinstall Debian to have it &ldquo;self detect&rdquo; the USB
wifi, but it still didn&rsquo;t seem to work, AND it kept failing at the
install step which added the environment (e.g. KDE, Gnome, default) I
tried various combinations, including just doing the defaults, but it
still failed and I couldn&rsquo;t find a log of the error.</p>

<p>Anyway, anyway, I&rsquo;m going to try Linux Mint installation.  If this
doesn&rsquo;t work with wifi card, I&rsquo;ll consider buying a new card as well
as scheduling a time to meet Travis who offered to support my Debian
experience.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m writing this from my MBP.  The Dell crawled to molasses speed
after a bit, and I&rsquo;m still optimistic that I won&rsquo;t have to powercycle
it.  It&rsquo;s still a bit responsive, so I just want to close some
programs and see if I can get it working again without shutting it
down completely.</p>

<h2 id="12-50">12:50</h2>

<p>The Dell is responding again, but I didn&rsquo;t need to merge anything in
git; I pushed from local MBP and then pulled, committed, and pushed on
Dell and now pulled on MBP, so I&rsquo;m back to 95% thinking I&rsquo;ll have to
merge somewhere in the near future.  Somewhere?  sometime?</p>

<p>On my old computer, I did something like right-click - show this box
in Finder.  The box is in its own folder so I just copied that entire
folder over the network to my debian box overnight.  Took about 6
hours as it&rsquo;s maybe 38GB (more than 10% of my previously planned HD
partition, and nearly than 40% of my previously-planned-to-purchase HD
size!)</p>

<p>In virtualbox on the new machine, I clicked File -&gt; Import Appliance,
but that did <em>not</em> work because I hadn&rsquo;t exported it from the old
computer.</p>

<p>So, in virtualbox on the new computer, I clicked Machine -&gt; Add, which
features shortcut key Ctrl-A, and navigated to the folder and opened
the .vbox file.</p>

<p>Opened with no problem, but when I tried to power it on, I got an
error:</p>

<pre><code>Could not start the machine *NAME* because the following physical
network interfaces were not found:
</code></pre>

<p>I have the option to Copy, Close VM, or Change Network Settings.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t really want a second copy of this VM, so I&rsquo;m just going to
Change Network Settings.</p>

<hr />

<p>Welp, looks like I have to create the network adapter first.  Closed
the VM and clicked File -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Network</p>

<p>then Host-only Networks tab and clicked the little plus icon to create
a new one.</p>

<p>It automagically created vboxnet0, which I think is the same name as I
didn&rsquo;t type above.</p>

<p>Clicked OK and then address two other issues I noted: This VM is
requesting more resources than this machine has!</p>

<p>Right clicked on the VM and selected settings, then tweaked some
sliders so they were in the green instead of red zones.  Wow this is
so easy!</p>

<h2 id="12-16">12:16</h2>

<p>Clicked start.</p>

<h2 id="12-20">12:20</h2>

<p>It seems to have started okay.  Now I need to see if I can get it to
serve web pages.  Hafta add to my local <code>/etc/hosts</code> file.</p>

<h2 id="12-58">12:58</h2>

<p>Boom.  I just added the entries to my local hosts file and the site
loaded perfectly.  Noice!</p>

<p>Next, I&rsquo;ll start copying the AB site to Dell machine, and while that&rsquo;s
running, get back to my more-neglected-than-usual inbox.</p>

<p>HAahah (*) tell you in a second</p>

<p>&ldquo;Debian seems fine,&rdquo; I told Travis via email, because it does.  The
<em>computer</em> is a bit slow, but that&rsquo;s not Debian&rsquo;s fault.  It&rsquo;s my
fault for using old hardware.</p>

<p>After turning on filesharing from my old machine, I successfully
copied the virtualbox box for CB to this machine, but haven&rsquo;t got it
started because the network adapter settings are different on this
hardware.</p>

<p>I decided to document what I had to do to get it working, and so
therefore needed to get my journal entries from bitbucket, and so
therefore needed to give this computer permission to access my
bitbucket account, and so therefore needed to create an ssh key, and
so therefore needed to look up how to do that.  Did the clone command
and it was like &ldquo;hey man that&rsquo;s an unknown host,&rdquo; and therefore had to
dig around to find the fingerprint online, and did <em>not</em> find a
canonical answer to what it should be, but found a reference to it in
a forum somewhere.</p>

<p>I realized I need to be careful to keep posting to the repo from both
machines, and guessed there&rsquo;s about a 90, nah, 85, nah who am I
kidding, 95% chance I&rsquo;ll forget and have to do a merge.  At least it
will be an interestingly easy way to see when I started the switch
from Mac to linux.</p>

<p>Cloned the repo, spun up emacs, and decided to use yesterday&rsquo;s entry
as a template for today&rsquo;s entry, as I haven&rsquo;t copied over my <code>.emacs</code>
file from the old machine.  It features handy keystrokes for creating
entry templates.. but for now screwit; I just need to slap down
<em>something</em> so I can get back to work and document getting the
virtualbox box back to working so I can get back to work on updating
the CB site before I have to go to work to teach two lessons near
Kawasaki station at 3pm.</p>

<p>(*) I laughed because after I opened the copy of yesterday&rsquo;s entry to
create today&rsquo;s entry, I realized the repo does <em>not</em> contain all the
changes I made yesterday on my MBP.  Yep.  gonna be some merges; 100%
sure!</p>
