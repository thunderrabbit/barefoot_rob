      <description>(written 21:32 Wednesday 18 September 2019 JST)
Headed toward home on Nambu Line now after waking up at 4:30 (after one sleep cycle) and doing my morning routine (write dreams, write gratitude, meditate, brush teeth, etc) then headed to work in Kawasaki for JB in Solid Square. Sayuri came about 15 minutes late and was the only student in attendance.
Headed to JR Kawasaki afterward to meet やなさん but he ended up having to cancel for some reason.</description>
